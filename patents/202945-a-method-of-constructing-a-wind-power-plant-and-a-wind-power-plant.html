				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention concerns a method for constructing a wind power plant as well as the wind power plant itself in its configuration.<br>
Thus far, when constructing wind power plants there is first produced a foundation, then the tower of the wind power plant is erected and subsequently the machine house is outfitted at the tip of the tower and the rotor is affixed with the rotor blades. After this, the electric power modules such as transformer, switch cabinets, possibly inverters, a medium-voltage system, a low-voltage distribution, etc., are installed. This is almost always done in a special small building outside the wind power plant.<br>
In DE 198 16 483.1 it has already been proposed to accommodate the transformer inside the tower, so that it is no longer necessary to construct a special transformer building with its own foundation.<br>
The purpose of the invention, now, is to develop a method by which the construction of wind power plants can be done even more advantageously, but especially even faster.<br>
The purpose is achieved by a method with the features of claim 1 and a wind power plant with the features of claim 2. Advantageous further develops are described in the subsidiary claims.<br>
According to the invention, it is proposed, in departure from the design of wind power plants heretofore, after constructing the foundation of the wind power plant, to place the essential power modules, i.e., transformer, switch cabinets, etc., on the foundation and only then erect the tower, so that all of the power modules after the erection of the tower are protected in the region of the tower foundation or in the lower part of the tower and rest safely on the tower foundation.<br>
The power modules are prefabricated as much as possible and mounted on carriers, so that the power modules can be set up on the tower foundation by a crane, which is needed<br><br>
anyway to construct a wind power plant, and the entire operational readying, especially the laying of cables and the entire operational preparation of the wind power plant, can occur in a protected space by adjustment of individual control modules, outfitting of the switch cabinets, etc., and these activities can commence once the tower has been constructed.<br>
It is also especially advantageous for the carriers of the power modules to have support feet, which in turn rest on prepositioned plates on the tower foundation. These plates are already fitted in front of determined positions during the creation of the foundation and they are fixed to the foundation so that the power modules can also be set up afterwards in very simple way and manner.<br>
Finally, it is also very advantageous to provide empty conduit cross arms in the foundation of the wind power plant for the cables leading out from the plant, i.e., especially the power transmission cables, control cables, etc., and to install these empty conduit cross arms in predetermined positions. For this, the cross arms are held by holding arms, which in turn are fixed in portions of the foundation or in the lower section of a tower. With these empty conduit cross arms, the region of the cable laying can be exactly predetermined and also in particular laid such that the cables extending from the power module to the foundation have the shortest and an optimal cable route.<br>
The measures according to the invention thus also facilitate the overall electrical equipment of the wind power plant by a prefabrication of individual modules such as the empty conduit cross arms, power module carriers, etc., as early as the construction of the foundation.<br>
With the steps according to the invention, the entire construction time for the wind power plant can be considerably shortened. Also, with the invention, the costs for the overall equipment of the wind power plant can be reduced, without having to balance this with<br><br>
Accordingly the present invention relates to a method of constructing a wind power plant having a tower, comprising the steps of; placing said tower as well as at least one electric power module on a foundation, wherein the electric power module comprises one or more of a transformer, an inverter, an electric device for controlling the wind power plant and an electric device for conducting the electric power produced by a generator of the wind power plant and fed into in a network, and placing the power module on the foundation before placing the tower on the foundation.<br>
The present invention also provides a wind power plant as herein above described wherein; a tower, which is set on a foundation, and a power module having one or more of a transformer, an inverter, an electric device for controlling the wind power plant and an electric device for conducting the electric power produced by a generator of the wind power plant, wherein said transformer is adapted to transform the electric energy produced by the generator to a medium or high voltage, and said power module comprises a carrier which is placed on the foundation and receives the electric devices of the power module, at least one of the width and the length of the power module is less than the diameter of the tower in the foundation area.<br>
The invention shall be explained more closely hereafter by means of an example shown in a drawing;<br><br>
Figure 1 shows a top view of a prearranged foundation (without concrete fill) with a steel reinforcement 1 and 2, on an empty conduit 3, which is supported via a brace 4 with a lowermost tower section adjoining the reinforcement. Furthermore, one notices carrier plates 5, which are arranged for holding arms 6 in the lowermost tower section (which will no longer be visible after constructing the wind power plant).<br>
The empty conduit 3 afterwards serves to accommodate cables, such as the power cable, by means of which the entire electric energy of the wind power plant is taken away to the network via ground cables. Often, several pipes are provided for this, rather than only one pipe.<br>
Figure 2 shows the foundation section after filling the concrete. Here, one notices that the empty conduits remain in their previously fixed position and the carrier plates have also been invested with concrete; during the concreting, it is important that the carrier plates lie snug on the structural concrete and thus afford a load support spread out over a surface. The concrete reaches to the upper edge of the carrier plates and is carefully worked at the edge of the plate.<br>
After the hardening of the concrete, the holding arms for holding the carrier plates and also the cross arms for attachment of the empty conduits can be dismantled and used again to construct other plants.<br>
After the hardening of the concrete, when constructing the rest of the wind power plant, the tower is not placed on the lowermost foundation for the tower section - as was usual heretofore - but instead a power module 7 is first placed on the carrier plates 5 (figures 2, 3 and 4).<br>
Such a power module 7 is shown in figure 3 in a two-part design, although the power module can also consist of additional parts.<br>
The two parts of the power module 7 are placed one on the other in the depicted example and the overall power module consists of two fitted-together carriers 8, which in turn support important parts of the power modules, i.e., the transformer, inverter, switch cabinets, medium-voltage layout, etc.<br><br>
The fitted-together carriers 8 are constructed in the manner of a frame and fit together exactly, so that a reliable securing to each other is also assured.<br>
The individual carriers have four vertically oriented spars - subtending a rectangle -joined together at the bottom. These spars are screwed together at their lower and upper end.<br>
After mounting the electric power module on the foundation, the tower 9 is erected (figure 4) and slipped over the power module. For this, the outer dimensions of the power module in terms of width and length are smaller than the inner diameter of the tower in the lower tower region/foundation region.<br>
After erecting the tower, the wind power plant is outfitted with the machine house, as usual, the rotor is mounted, and appropriate electrical connections are produced between the generator and the power module 7 to enable operation and the power module (output of the transformer) is also hooked up to the power supply network.<br>
When the above described empty conduits or devices provided for laying the cables have been previously secured in particular prescribed position, the connection between the power module and the network can also be produced extremely fast and advantageously, with minimal overall cable lengths, because the empty conduits are positioned where they mate precisely with the corresponding parts of the power module.<br>
In the wind power plant of the invention, it is also advantageous for the access to the wind power plant to no longer necessarily be through a conventional door in the fixed region of the foundation, but instead through a door (access) which is positioned so that it emerges in the region above the parts of the power module carrying the high or medium voltage. For this, a corresponding ladder or stairs can be provided on the outside of the tower. This positioning of the access door has the advantage that the personnel who have to visit the plant frequently do not have to constantly walk past the parts of the power module carrying high or medium voltage when the plant is in operation. This also ensures that no one is in direct proximity to the power module by accident or mistake during the<br><br>
operation of the wind power plant and makes contact with the parts carrying voltage or current, which might cause a major accident.<br>
In the region of the access door of the tower, an appropriate intermediate platform is then provided, which can be used by personnel entering the tower, so that they can move up higher in the wind power plant on the inside of the tower or make adjustments to various v control devices or read off measurement data.<br>
A wind power plant of the invented type generally has available more than 100 kW of rated power, preferably a power rating in the range of 500 kW, 1 MW, 1.5 MW, or considerably more. Preferably, the intermediate platform is provided with a locking plate, through which the personnel can enter the lower region of the power module. Locking of the hatch affords further protection of the lower part of the power module against unauthorized access.<br>
The inner diameter of the tower in the foundation region can be several meters, so that the overall surface there is 100 m or more and therefore a sufficiently large area is also available to accommodate the power modules. Insofar as the term "power module" is used in this application, it means the medium and high voltage carrying part of the wind power plant. These are, in particular, the units such as transformer or inverter or emergency switch and the medium voltage switch cabinet or also the low voltage distributor.<br><br>
