Preparation of functionalized cationic polymers and their preparation and application in per¬sonal care<br>
The present invention is directed to functionalized water-soluble cationic polymers, methods to make them, and the use of compositions containing them in personal care applications.<br>
Cationic polymers have been used extensively in home and personal care, water treatment, papermaking, mineral processing, petroleum recovery, fabrics, and pharmaceuticals. Among the most important and extensively used cationic polymers are the quaternary ammonium polymers of diallyldialkyl ammonium compounds. Polymers of diallyldimethyl ammonium chloride (DADMAC) are known in the home and personal care industry as polyquaternium 6, and are used extensively in skin and hair care applications.<br>
The use of homo- and copolymers of diallyldimethylamnionium salts in hair care applications has been disclosed in several U.S. Patent documents.<br>
Most of the currently available cationic polymers provide basic hair conditioning properties, but they also bring along some undesired attributes. One of these undesirable attributes is tackiness. This is also known as a sticky feeling of the polymer on the hair. This undesirable characteristic will cause the hair to clump, causing a decrease in hair volume. It may also weigh down the hair yielding a flattening effect.<br>
The present invention relates to novel water-soluble and cationic copolymers, for example of diallyldimethylammonium chloride (DADMAC) and diallylamine (DAA), that provide excellent conditioning properties and improved tackiness. These copolymers overcome the tacky ef¬fect of the typical quatemary ammonium polymers of diallyldialkyi ammonium compounds (polyDADMAC). They also provide an excellent feel with less static fly away. They also con¬tribute useful properties to skin care products.<br>
U.S. Patent Specification Nos. 3,700,623 and 3,833,531 teach making acid stabilized poly-(diallylamine)-epihalohydrin resins. In a first step a polymer of diallylamine (DAA) is prepared through radical polymerization using a radical initiator. The polymer of diallylamine is then re¬acted with an epihalohydrin, usually epichlorohydrin (ECH), at a temperature from about 30 to 80 °C and at a pH from 7 to 9.5 in aqueous solution. When the viscosity measured on a 20% to 30% solid solution reached a desired viscosity range (A to E on the Gardner-Holdt scale), the product is diluted with water to below 15% solids.<br><br>
The obtained resin had a tendency to gel on standing. The resin solution is therefore stabi¬lized against gelation by adding enough water-soluble acid, e.g. HCI, to adjust the pH to about 2. The acid-stabilized poly(diallylamine)-epichlorohydrin resins are  reactivated prior to use by addition of a base, e.g. NaOH, to adjust pH to above 7. The half-reacted epihalo-hydrin entities of the alkaline curing resins impart epoxy functionality for crosslinking reac¬tions after being reactivated by addition of alkaline base prior to use. These polymers are in¬soluble after crosslinking.<br>
U.S. Patent Specification Nos. 4,354,006, 4,419,498 and 4,419,500 teach a process for making poly(DAA-ECH) polymers by reacting a diallylamine (DAA) polymer first with an ally! halide and then with hypohalous acid to convert the allyl substituents to halohydrin moieties.<br>
Japanese Publistied Patent Application 6,108,382 discloses another way to make poly(dial-lylamine)-epihalohydrln polymers. A diallylamine-epihalohydrin halo salt monomer is first prepared by reacting diallylamine with an epihalohydrin (typically epichlorohydrin) and then neutralizing with a halo acid,typically HCI. The DAA-ECH tertiary amine salt monomer is then polymerized using a radical initiator. The obtained poly(diallyamine)-epihalohydrin polymer is disclosed to provide excellent wet color fastness to a cellulose-based fiber dyed with a direct dye or a reactive dye.<br>
U.S. Patent Specification No. 5,147,411 discloses a method to prepare the DAA-ECH monomers (3-halo-2-hydroxypropyl)diallylamine and (2,3-epoxypropyl)diallylamine, and their quaternary ammonium salts. The quaternary ammonium DAA-ECH salts are prepared by re¬acting a DAA-ECH tertiary amine with an alkyl sulfonate. The DAA-ECH quaternary ammo¬nium salts are used directly in treating cellulose fiber material for improved color yield and wet-fastness of dyeing.<br>
U.S. Patent Specification No. 4,341,887 discloses that the reaction product of diallylamine and epichlorohydrin (3-chloro-2-hydroxypropyl)diallylamine (a DAA-ECH monomer), can be converted to N,N-diallyl-3-hydroxy-azetidinium chloride (DAA-ECH azetidinium monomer) by heating in the presence of water. Removal of the solvent (water) by distillation or freeze dry¬ing causes the DAA-ECH azetidinium monomer to reconvert to the linear, non-quaternary N-3-chloro-2-hydroxypropyl-N,N-diallylamine. However (3-chloro-2-hydroxypropyl)diallyl-amine is not stable and dimerizes to 2,5-bis(diallylaminomethyl)-p-dioxane. The azetidinium ring remains intact in the polymers obtained by free radical polymerization of the DAA-ECH azetidinium monomer. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectroscopy are used to identify the azetidin¬ium ring in the monomer and the polymers. The homo- and co- polymers of N,N-diallyl-3-hy-droxyazetidinium are useful for demulsification, flocculation and floatation in water treatment.<br><br>
The above-reviewed patent documents involve use of an epihalotiydrin as a reactive com¬pound to react with DAA monomer or a DM polymer. Since an epihalohydrin, e.g. epichlorohydrin, is a difunctional reactive crosslinker, highly crosslinked insoluble end prod¬ucts are obtained when fully reacted with equivalent high DAA-containing, i.e. &gt;5%, poly¬mers. In the case where soluble cationic polymers are obtained, the polymers contain half reacted epichlorohydrin with potentially reactive epoxy groups. Only epihalohydrin is dis¬closed as a cross-linker for diallylamine polymers. Other polyfunctional compounds which could be used to crosslink the diallylamine polymers are not mentioned.<br>
U.S. Patent Specification No. 6,323,306 discloses a method to prepare water-soluble cationic polymers by reacting an amino-functionalized DADMAC polymer with a difunctional reactive crosslinker. The reactive crosslinkers include epihalohydrin and other polyfunctional com¬pounds that can be used to cross-link the diallylamine polymers. The patent is limited to a DAA content of less than 5% to prevent formation of undesirable insoluble products which can be caused by excessive crosslinking due to use of the difunctional reactive crosslinker.<br>
U.S. Patent Specification No. 6,476,627 discloses polymeric light stabilizers which contain hindered amine nitroxide, hydroxylamine or hydroxylammonium salt groups, which stabilizers are useful for preventing loss of brightness and for enhancing resistance to yellowing in pulp or paper which still contains lignin. These polymers may be prepared by reacting a polymer containing pendant amino or hydroxyl groups, for example an amino-functionalized DADMAC polymer or a polyamine, with suitable hindered amine educts.<br>
Subject matter of the present invention is a method of making functionalized cationic poly¬mers useful in personal care and cosmetic applications by reacting at least one functional re¬active compound with at least one water-soluble amino-group containing cationic base poly¬mer which may be linear or branched and is optionally crosslinked. In one embodiment this is for example a copolymer of diallyldimethylammonium chloride (DADMAC and diallylamine (DAA).<br>
A high degree of functionality, i.e. &gt; 5%, can be achieved by using monofunctional reactive compounds. A high degree of functionality, i.e. &gt; 5%, can also be achieved using a difunc¬tional reactive compound, i.e. a crosslinker, for example by using a large excess of the di¬functional reactive compound so that predominantly mono reaction and little crosslinking of the base polymer occurs.<br>
The functionality of the functionalized cationic polymer of the present invention comes from the functional reactive compound used. Hydrophobic reactive compounds are preferably used to impart hydrophobicity to the base cationic polymer.<br><br>
One object of the present invention is to provide functionalized or hydrophobically modified cationic copolymers, for example polyDADMAC-type copolymers, and methods for their pre¬paration.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide personal care compositions and methods of use of functionalized or hydrophobically modified cationic copolymers, for example polyDADMAC type copolymers, for example as additives to hair conditioners that enhance the feel, shine and many other properties of hair, or as additives to compositions for the skin.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a personal care composition comprising at least one water-soluble functionalized cationic polymer obtainable by grafting an amino-group con¬taining cationic base polymer with at least one compound which is reactive to the amino groups on the base polymer, at least one cosmetically-functional agent, and at least one cosmetically tolerable adjuvant.<br>
The inventive polymers having hydrophobic/hydrophilic and cationic groups are able to en¬hance the substantivity of the polymer to keratinous substrates like hair, thereby improving the efficacy of a hair conditioner where it is most needed. At the same time, these polymers possess reasonable water solubility/dispersibility that can facilitate ease of use.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide personal care and cosmetic compositions, for example products for the skin and various forms of hair care products as aforementioned, wherein the performance of such products is further enhanced by incorporation of other ad¬ditives, such as perfumes, soil release polymers, colorants, preservatives, antimicrobials with activities against various microorganisms, optical brighteners, UV absorbers and other light management agents.<br>
It has now been discovered that water-soluble functionalized cationic polymers can be made by reacting a water-soluble cationic base polymer, which may be linear or branched and is optionally crosslinked, and contains amino groups with at least one compound which is reac¬tive to the amino groups in the base polymer to impart the desired functionality. The reactive compound may be hydrophilic or hydrophobic, anionic, cationic, amphoteric or nonionlc. In one embodiment at least one hydrophobic reactive compound is used as the grafting agent to impart hydrophobicity to the cationic base polymer.<br>
A further embodiment of the invention relates to a method of preparing a functionalized and/or hydrophobically modified cationic polymer which comprises, reacting a cationic base polymer, which may be linear or branched and is optionally crosslinked, and contains amino groups, with at least one functional compound, which may be hydrophobic or hydrophilic, anionic, cationic, amphoteric or nonionlc, that can react with at least a part of the amino<br><br>
groups in the base polymer, with the proviso that the functional compound either does not contain hindered amine nitroxide, hydroxylamine or hydroxylammonium salt groups or, if such groups are present, at least a part of the amino-functional groups in the base polymer are also reacted, simultaneously or sequentially in any order, with at least one functional compound that does not contain hindered amine nitroxide, hydroxylamine or hydroxylammo¬nium salt groups.<br>
In another aspect the present invention relates to a functionalized and/or hydrophobically modified cationic polymer obtainable by reacting a cationic base polymer, which may be lin¬ear or branched and is optionally crosslinked, and contains amino groups, with at least one functional compound, which may be hydrophobic or hydrophilic, anionic, cationic, amphoteric or nonionic, that can react with at least a part of the amino groups in the base polymer, with the proviso that the functional compound either does not contain hindered amine nitroxide, hydroxylamine or hydroxylammonium salt groups or, if such groups are present, at least a part of the amino-functional groups in the base polymer are also reacted, simultaneously or sequentially in any order, with at least one functional compound that does not contain hin¬dered amine nitroxide, hydroxylamine or hydroxylammonium salt groups.<br>
The functionalized copolymers of the instant invention are prepared from cationic base poly¬mers that contain sites suitable for grafting or cross-linking by added grafting and optionally cross-linking reagents. The functionalized water-soluble copolymers may be linear or branched and are optionally crosslinked.<br>
Base polymers similar to those of the present invention have been disclosed previously, al¬though heretofore the number of base polymer cross-linking sites has generally been so nu¬merous and the crossJinker level used has been so high that the resulting polymers are cross-linked, mainly by epichlorohydrin, to an extent sufficiently high as to render them in¬soluble. Such insoluble resins are quite different in structure and in their intended application from the water-soluble base polymers employed herein.<br>
A high degree of functionality (&gt; 5 mol%) can be achieved without crosslinking the cationic base polymer, for example a poly-DADMAC-type cationic base polymer, by using a mono-functional reactive compound.<br>
A water-soluble functionalized cationic polymer having a branched structure can be achieved with a difunctional reactive compound, such as epichlorohydrin by controlling its incorporation into the base polymer at a low level, e.g. 
 <br>
3% of a difunctional reactive crosslinker. Such water-soluble crosslinked polymers are suitable as cationic base polymers which can be converted into water-soluble functionalized cationic polymers as taught herein. A water-soluble functionalized cationic polymer having a branched structure can also be achieved with a difunctional reactive compound by controlling the stoichiometric ratio of the base polymer and the reactive compound and/or the molecular weight of the base polymer used.<br>
The grafted copolymers of the present invention provide exceptional conditioning properties on hair as well as enhancing the properties of skin care compositions.<br>
In one embodiment the present invention is directed to a functionalized cationic copolymer comprising a main backbone obtainable by reacting:<br>
(a)	0.1 to 99.9% by weight, preferably 20% to 99% by weight, of at least one cationic reactant<br>

(b)	0.1 to 99.9% by weight of at least one functional compound (grafting agent), which may<br>
be hydrophobic or hydrophilic, anionic, cationic, amphoteric or nonionic, and is reactive to the<br>
attached amino groups on the backbone of the polymer of the formula (I), with the proviso<br>
that the functional compound either does not contain hindered amine nitroxide, hydroxyl-<br>
amine or hydroxylammonium salt groups or, if such groups are present in the functional<br>
compound, at least a part of the amino-functional groups in the base polymer are also re¬<br>
acted, simultaneously or sequentially in any order, with at least one functional compound that<br>
does not contain hindered amine nitroxide, hydroxylamine or hydroxylammonium salt groups.<br>
In one embodiment the functionalized cationic polymers of the present invention are repre¬sented by the formulae:<br><br><br>
wherein R1 and R2 are independently of each other, hydrogen, alkyl, hydroxyalkyl, carboxyal-kyl, carboxamidoalkyl, or alkoxyalkyl having from 1 to 18 carbon atoms, Mc represents a residue from an optional monomer C, and Yrepresents an anion which can be inorganic or organic, Fg is the residue from at least one functional reactant grafted onto a cationic amino base polymer; R3 is hydrogen, C1-C4alkyl or Fg; m, n and p are the mol fractions of the re¬peating units in the corresponding brackets, respectively, of the polymer of fonnula (la) or (lb); m + n + p = 1 and * is a terminal group, for example a catalyst residue, with the proviso that the functional residue Fg either does not contain hindered amine nitroxide, hydroxyl-amine or hydroxylammonium salt groups or, if such groups are present, at least a part of the amino-functional residue groups in the polymer have at least one functional residue that does not contain hindered amine nitroxide, hydroxylamine or hydroxylammonium salt groups.<br>
In one embodiment the present invention Is directed to personal care and cosmetic composi¬tions comprising:<br>
A) a polymeric functionalized cationic copolymer having a main backbone obtainable by re¬acting:<br>
0.1 to 99.9% by weight, preferably 20% to 99% by weight, of at least one cationic reactant according to formula (I), where R is hydrogen or C1-C4 alkyl; R1 and R2 are, independently of each other, alkyl, hydroxyalkyl, carboxyalkyl, carboxamidoalkyl, or alkoxyalkyl having from 1 to 18 carbon atoms; Mc represents a residue from an optional monomer (C), such as (meth)acrylamide or (meth)acrylate; n, m and p are the mol fractions of the repeating units in the corresponding brackets, respectively, of the cationic reactant of formula (I), m + n + p = 1, and Y' represents an anion, with 0.1 to 99.9% by weight of at least one reactive functional compound (grafting agent), which may be hydrophobic or hydrophilic, anionic, cationic, am¬photeric or nonionic, and is reactive to the amino groups on the backbone of the polymer of the formula (I);<br><br>
B)	at least one cosmetically-functional agent, and<br>
C)	at least one cosmetically tolerable adjuvant.<br>
In one embodiment of the personal care and cosmetic compositions, the functionalized cati-onic polymers of the present invention are represented by the formulae la or lb as defined above, wherein R1 and R2 are independently of each other, hydrogen; alkyl, hydroxyalkyi, carboxyalkyl, carboxamidoalkyl, or alkoxyalkyl having from 1 to 18 carbon atoms, Mc repre¬sents a residue from an optional monomer C, and Y" represents an anion which can be inor¬ganic or organic, Fg is the residue from at least one functional reactant grafted onto a cati-onic amino-functional base polymer; R3 is hydrogen, C1-C4 alkyl or Fg; m, n and p are the mol fractions of the repeating units in the corresponding brackets, respectively, of the poly¬mer of formula (Ilia) or (lllb) and * is a terminal group, for example a catalyst residue.<br>
The above formulae are idealized. In the actual polymers the various groups may be linked in any order. Both block and random copolymers are within the scope of the above formulae.<br>
Many personal care compositions, for example, shampoos, soaps, etc., are washed away from the substrate after application. If one is to incorporate a conditioning agent into such compositions and wants the active ingredient to remain on the substrate after the rest of the formulation is washed away, it is important that the conditioning copolymer possesses ex¬cellent substantivity to the substrate. Since many of the substrates of concern, i.e. skin, hair, and nails, are hydrophobic and slightly anionic, a substance that is also hydrophobic, of higher molecular weight and catatonically charged would be preferred in order to impart the desired degree of substantivity to the substrate.<br>
One aspect of the present invention Is directed to a method for making a functionalized wa¬ter-soluble cationic polymer by reacting a cationic base polymer, which are linear or branched and is optionally crosslinked, and contains amino groups, with at least one func¬tional compound, which may be hydrophobic or hydrophllic, anionic, cationic, amphoteric or nonionic, that can react with at least a part of the amino groups in the base polymer, with the proviso that the functional compound either does not contain hindered amine nitroxide, hydroxylamine or hydroxylammonium salt groups or, if such groups are present, at least a part of the amino-functional groups in the base polymer are also reacted, simultaneously or sequentially in any order, with at least one functional compound that does not contain hin¬dered amine nitroxide, hydroxylamine or hydroxylammonium salt groups.<br>
In one embodiment the method comprises<br>
reacting an amino-functional cationic base polymers of the formula (I),<br><br>
which are linear or branched and optionally crosslinked, where R is hydrogen or C1-C4alkyl; R1 and R2 are, independently of each other, alkyl, hydroxyalkyl, carboxyalkyl, carboxamidoal-kyl, or alkoxyalkyl groups having from 1 to 18 carbon atoms; Mc represents a residue from an optional monomer (C), such as (meth)acrylamide or (meth)acrylate, n, m and p are the mol fractions of the repeating units in the corresponding brackets, respectively, of the cationic re-actant of fonnula (I); m + n + p = 1, and Y" represents an anion, with at least one functional compound which can react with at least a part of the amino functional groups in the base polymer, with the proviso that the functional compound either does not contain hindered amine nitroxide, hydroxylamine or hydroxylammonium salt groups or, if such groups are pre¬sent in the functional compound, at least a part of the amino-functional groups in the base polymer are also reacted, simultaneously or sequentially in any order, with at least one func¬tional compound that does not contain hindered amine nitroxide, hydroxylamine or hydroxyl¬ammonium salt groups.<br>

The amount of the free radical initiator used in the polymerization process depends on the total monomer concentration and the type of monomers used, and may range from about 0.2 to about 5.0 wt% of total monomer charge to achieve more than 99% of total monomer con¬version.<br>
In one embodiment the polymerization is carried out in the substantial absence of oxygen. Oxygen can be removed from the reaction medium by applying vacuum with agitation or by purging with an inert gas, such as nitrogen or argon.

In one embodiment the functlonaiized cationic polymers of this invention may be synthesized by first reacting allyl glycidyl ether or a allyl halide with a primary or secondary amine on the cationic base polymer to introduce at least one allyloxy group, then adding an R6-iodide to the resulting allyloxy radical, followed by partial or complete dehydrohalogenation. This is analogous to the reaction sequence disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,706,923.<br><br>
The addition of the perfluoroallcyl iodide to the allyloxy group may be carried out using meth¬ods and conditions similar to those disclosed for the addition of a perfluoroalkyi iodide to allyl alcohol in U.S. Patent Specification No. 5,585,517.<br>
In another embodiment perfluoroalkylethyl iodides may also be added to a cationic base polymer backbone by first forming a perfluoroalkylethylene intermediate, which then adds to the amine groups on the polymer backbone as described in U.S. Patent Specification No. 6,365,676.<br>

Prefen-ed dihaloalkyi compounds are 1,2-dibromoethane and 1,2-dichloroethane.<br>
Trihalo compounds, such as cyanuric chloride and its chloro-substituted derivatives, may also be employed. As is known, replacement of each halogen on cyanuric chloride is progressively more difficult. This may be exploited to introduce dihalotriazinyl functional groups into a cationic base polymer, with subsequent reaction to introduce further functional¬ity.<br>
Examples of other difunctional reactants to graft or crosslink cationic base polymers include, N,N'-methyleneblsacrylamide (MBA), N,N'-ethyienebisacrylamide, epichlorohydrin, ethylene glycol diacrylate, diethylene glycol diacrylate, poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate, poly(propylene glycol) diacrylate and the like. MBA is a preferred crosslinking agent.<br>
Depending on the reactant charge ratio, one can preferentially react just one functional group of a difunctional reactant. When used as a crosslinker for the cationic base polymer, only low amounts (0.1 to 3 wt-%) will normally be employed.<br>
Compounds containing activated oleflnic double bonds can also be used to graft or crosslink cationic base polymers containing primary or secondary amino groups via a Michael addition. Examples of monofunctional compounds suitable for use in a Michael addition include, (meth)acrylamide, (meth)acrylonitrile, esters of (meth)acrylic acid, such as methyl acrylate, butyl acrylate, lauryl acrylate(LA), 2-hydoxyethyl acrylate (HEA), N-substituted (meth)acryla-mides, such as N,N-dimethylacrylamide and N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPA). Preferred com¬pounds include 2-hydoxyethyi acrylate, N,N-dimethylacrylamide and N-isopropylacrylamide.<br>
In the previously mentioned functionalized cationic polymers of formulae (la and lb).<br><br><br>
In one embodiment an isocyanate compound is grafted to a cationic base polymer containing primary or secondary amino groups. Examples of suitable isocyanate compounds include al-kyl isocyanates, such as isopropyl isocyanate, benzyl isocyanate, cyclohexyl isocyanate, do-decyl isocyanate, and other monofunctional isocyanates, such as 3-(triethoxysilyl)propyl iso¬cyanate, isocyanatoethyl methacrylate and the like. Examples of diisocyanate compounds include isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI), 1,4-diisocyanobutane, hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI), toluene diisocyanate (TDI) and the like as well as diisocyanate compounds wherein one of the reactive groups is temporarily protected by an appropriate blocking agent. Pre¬ferred compounds include TDI, HDI, IPDi, etc.<br>
Anhydride compounds can also graft to base polymers containing primary or secondary amino groups. Examples of suitable anhydride compounds for reactant (II) include phthalic, maleic, succinic, pyromellitic and tetrahydrophthalic anhydrides, 2-dodecen-1-yl succinic an¬hydride and the like. In one embodiment the anhydride compound is 2-dodecen-1-yl succinic anhydride.<br>
The reactive compound is used in an amount from about 0.02 to about 3.0 mol, preferably from 0.2 to 1.0 mol, of functional groups in the reactive compound for each mol of reactive amine present in the base polymer. The equivalent ratio of reactive compound to base poly¬mer may change depending on the desired properties for the final polymer. The reactive compound is used in an amount which is effective to give a product desired properties after being fully reacted with the amino functional groups in the base polymer. More than one re-<br><br>
active compound may be reacted, simultaneously or sequentially in any order, with the base polymer.<br>
The grafting reaction can be carried out in an aqueous medium or in the same reaction me¬dium, e.g. water-ln-oil emulsion, as is used for preparing the base polymer in step (a). The reaction is preferably carried out in aqueous medium at a pH from about 7 to about 11, pref¬erably from 7.5 to 9.5, and at a temperature from about 0° to about 100°C, preferably from 20° to 80°C. The solids concentration of the base polymer in the reaction medium prior to re¬action can be, by weight, from 1% to about 60%, preferably from 10% to 25% for a solution of the base polymer, and preferably from 20 to 50% for an emulsion or dispersion of the base polymer.<br>
In one embodiment the reactive compound is a hydrophobic reactant (II) which dissolves, at least in part, in the aqueous phase and is grafted onto the functional portion of the polymer backbone to form a polymer having both catlonic and hydrophobic groups. When the hydro¬phobic reactant (II) is added to the polymer in an amount higher than its water solubility, the excess amount can form a second phase in the form of fine droplets if adequate agitation is provided. At the high reaction pH (&gt; 8), the amine groups in the cationic base polymer are not protonated and may form hydrophobic domains to absorb hydrophobic reactant (II) for grafting. The hydrophobic domains of the polymer will grow as the hydrophobic grafting pro¬gresses, accelerating transfer of hydrophobic reactant (II) to the reaction sites. The fine droplets of hydrophobic reactant (II) will eventually disappear after they are all transferred to the hydrophobic domain of the base polymer (I) for grafting.<br>
Reactants with a functional group reactive to the amino groups in the base cationic polymer but also very reactive with water are preferably grafted in a non-aqueous solvent. In one em¬bodiment the cationic base polymer is prepared in an aqueous solution. The aqueous solu¬tion of base polymer can then be dried to remove water and redissolved in a non-aqueous solvent for reacting with water-sensitive reactive compounds, such as acid halides and anhy¬drides. Alternatively, a non-aqueous solvent can be added to the solution of the aqueous base polymer and the water removed by azeotropic distillation.<br>
Examples of water-sensitive reactive compounds preferred for non-aqueous grafting include acid halides, anhydrides and isocynates. Since the reaction of an isocyanate with a primary or secondary amino group is much faster than with water, isocyanate compounds can also be reacted in an aqueous medium.<br>

A 1 I reactor equipped with a condenser, a thermometer, a nitrogen inlet and an overhead agitator is charged with 260 g of 66% DADMAC monomer, 34.5 g of diallylamine (DAA), 35.0 g of HCI solution, 6.0 g of deionized water, and 0.4 g of 20% Na4EDTA solution. The polymerization mixture is purged with nitrogen and heated with agitation to a temperature of 80°C. An aqueous solution containing 2.1 g of ammonium persulfate (APS) is slowly fed to the reaction mixture over 190 minutes. The reaction temperature is allowed to increase to above 90°C and then maintained at 90° to 100°C during the APS feed period. After the APS feed, the reaction temperature is held at 95°C for about 30 minutes. An aqueous solution containing 6 g of sodium metablsulfite (MBS) is added over 30 minutes. The reaction mixture is held at 95°C for another 30 minutes to complete the polymerization (above 99% conver¬sion). The polymer solution is then diluted with sufficient water to about 35% solids by weight<br><br>
and cooled to room temperature. The final product has a Brookfleld viscosity of 9100 cps at 25°C (using a Brookfield LV4 spindle at 30 rpms) and 33% polymer solids.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Following the same procedure as Example 1 the following polymers (in Table 1 below) are synthesized. The final product viscosities are measured at 25°C using a Brookfield viscome¬ter using a Brookfield LVT #3 spindle at 12 rpms. The viscosity results are shown in Table 1 below.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
A 0.5-1 reactor fitted with a mechanical stirrer, addition funnel and condenser is charged with 228.0 g (0.129 mol secondary amine, NH) of the base polymer from Example 1. The reactor content is adjusted with 6.0 g of 25% NaOH aqueous solution to a pH of 9.0 to 10.0 and heated to 70°C with agitation. After the pH adjustment, 7.6 g (0.0076 mol epoxide) of mono-(2,3-epoxy)propyl ether-terminated polydimethylsiloxane (MCR-E11 from the Gelest) is added into the reactor. The grafting reaction is maintained at about 70°C and the viscosity of the reaction solution is monitored with an agitator torque meter. The viscosity of the reactor contents, as is indicated by the torque meter reading, increases with reaction time. The vis¬cosity increase is believed to result from association of grafted hydrophobic siloxane groups and can be an indication of the grafting reaction. While the viscosity shows little further in¬crease with increasing reaction time after about four hours, the reaction mixture Is held at 70°C for another 2 hours. A concentrated HCI solution and deionized water are added to ad¬just the pH to about 5 and the solids. The resulting polymer product is a homogeneous, yel¬lowish emulsion-looking solution having 20.0 wt-% of polymer solids (base polymer la + grafting agent II) and a Brookfield viscosity of about 1200 cps (using a Brookfield LV3 spindle at 30 rpms at 25°C). The functionalized cationic polymer contains about 10 wt-% of grafted MCR-E11, which provides hydrophobic siloxane functionality to the copolymer.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
The procedure of Example 3 is followed except that 18.1 g Instead 7.6 g of MCR-E11 grafting agent is added. The resulting polymer product is a homogeneous, yellowish emulsion-looking solution with 20.0 wt-% of polymer solids (base polymer I + grafting agent II) and a Brookfield viscosity of about 1200 cps (using a Brookfield LV3 spindle at 30 rpms at 25 °C). The co¬polymer contains about 20 wt-% of grafted MCR-E11 which provides substantial hydrophobic siloxane functionality to the cationic copolymer.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
A 1-1 reactor fitted with a mechanical stirrer, addition funnel and condenser is charged with 250 g of 22.1 wt-% base polymer from Example 1 (0.096 mol secondary amine, NH). 6.0 g of a 25% NaOH solution is added to bring the pH above 9.0. The reactor contents are diluted with 26.2 g of deionized water, and then 10.0 g of 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate (HEA, 97%) is added at a temperature of about 20 °C. The reaction is monitored by following the disap¬pearance of HEA via liquid chromatography (HPLC). The grafting reaction is temriinated after more than 95% of the added HEA has reacted. The reaction causes an increase in viscosity. Deionized water is added from time to time during the reaction to maintain a suitable reaction viscosity for agitation. The resulting product is a clear solution containing 11.5 wt-% of the grafted polymer solids. The polymer solids contain about 15 wt-% of grafted HEA units which adds hydroxyl functionality to the cationic pDADMAC/DAA copolymer.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
1.8 g of acrylamide (50%) solution is added to 25 g of the product from Example 1 after the pH is adjusted to 9.0 with a 25% NaOH solution. After thorough mixing the solution is allowed to react at 23° to 26°C for about three days. The solution viscosity increases from an initial 7720 cps to 16 320 cps after the reaction. The resulting polymer solution is clear and con¬tains 31.2 wt-% polymer solids. The obtained cationic copolymer has about 15 wt-% of grafted acrylamide units which adds the functionality of pendant amide groups to the cationic pDADMAC/DAA copolymer.<br>
EXAMPLE 7<br>
50 g (428 mmol) of methoxypolyethylene glycol 350 (MPEG 350-Dow chemical) is placed into a round-bottomed flask equipped with a stirrer, nitrogen inlet and a thermoregulator and heated with stirring. When the temperature reaches 65°C, 1.6 g of boron trifluoride etherate is added to the flask. Then 35.7 g (386 mmol) of epichlorohydrin is added dropwise to the<br><br>
flask over 1 hour. An exotherm is observed with an increase in temperature from 65 °C to 74°C. When the rise in temperature subsides, the reaction mixture is maintained at 65 °C for three hours with stirring. At this time the consumption of epichlorohydrin Is determined to be complete by gas chromatography. Next 30.8 g of a 50% NaOH solution is added to the mix¬ture, which is then stirred at 60 °C for one hour. Formation of epoxy groups is monitored by gas chromatography and chloride ion titration. The mixture is then extracted using diethyl ether to separate the product from water and salts. This intermediate is obtained as a clear amber liquid.<br>
EXAMPLE 8-28<br>
50.0 g (20.5 mmol/eq. wt. based on DAA in sample) of the base polymer B from Example 2 is diluted with 20 g of deionized water. The pH is adjusted with 1.2 g of a 50% NaOH solution. 1.2 g (6.2 mmol) of 1-oxy-2,2,6,6,-tetramethyl-4-glycidyloxypiperidine (glycidol TEMPO) is added to the solution. After thorough mixing, the reaction mixture is allowed to react at 70 °C for 5 hours. After this time the consumption of 1-oxy-2,2,6,6,-tetramethyl-4-glycidyloxypip-eridine (glycidol TEMPO) is detemnined to be &gt; 99% by liquid chromatography. 50 g of de-ionized water is added along with 0.5 g of 50% NaOH solution. When the temperature reaches 70°C, 5.5 g (6.2 mmol) of a 38% solution of 3-chloro-2-hydroxypropyl-dimethyldo-decylammonium chloride (Quab® 342 from Degussa) and 5 g of 2-propanol are added to the flask. The reaction mixture is maintained at 70-75 °C for three hours with stirring. During the reaction 20.0 g of deionized water is added to aid in viscosity control. The mixture is then analyzed for the consumption of Quab 342 using liquid chromatography. Also the hydrolysis of the Quab 342 to Glycol is monitored by titration and using liquid chromatography. After this time the mixture is cooled to room temperature and 116 g of deionized water and 1.4 g of concentrated HCI is added to adjust the pH. The modified polyDADMAC copolymer is ob¬tained as a clear viscous yellow mixture of 9.1 wt.% solids. The cationic polymer contains about 4.4 wt-% of grafted glycidol TEMPO which provides antioxidant functionality from the pendant nitroxyl groups and 7.7 wt% of the 3-chloro-2-hydroxypropyl-dimethyldodecylammo-nium chloride reaction product.<br><br><br><br>

The remaining mixture is cooled and transferred to a separatory funnel. 25.8 g of de-ionized water and lOOg of diethyl ether is added. The water layer is discarded and the ether<br><br>
layer dried under vacuum distillation at 40 °C. The perfluoroalkyi iodide intermediate,   , is obtained as a clear orange mixture containing 42.3% fluorine.<br>
