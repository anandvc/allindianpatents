Processing of Organic Material<br>
The invention relates to methods and apparatus for the processing of organic material in superheated steam and/or other gases in order advantageously to alter its physical properties and/or its chemical composition while usefully recovering or combusting components emitted from it as gases and then to cool its solid residues in an inert gas to prevent said solid residues' spontaneous ignition on re-entering ambient air. The organic material may be moist organic material, in which case a first operation of drying the material, conveniently in superheated steam, may be included. The invention is applicable to continuous processing, batch processing and continuous, sequenced batch processing of materials.<br>
The expression "organic material" includes green and post-consumer wood and other organic material such as forestry and agricultural wastes and any other mainly or partly organic material such as paper and food industry sludges and municipal and commercial waste streams containing, for example, food, paper and plastic residues and used tyres which may advantageously be processed according to the invention. It will be appreciated that in many cases the organic material will have a significant moisture content.<br>
It is known continuously to dry moist materials in superheated steam. For example, British Patent Specification No. 2281383 describes an apparatus for continuous drying of moist materials in superheated steam comprising a drying enclosure, open-ended inlet and outlet ducts communicating with the enclosure and conveyors for conveying the material to be dried along the inlet duct, through the enclosure and along the outlet duct. Superheated steam is generated in the enclosure from the moisture in the material being dried by circulating the initial gas within the enclosure between a heat source and the material, and/or by the injection into the enclosure of superheated steam from an external source. The inlet duct and outlet duct both extend downwardly from the enclosure and a vent duct from the enclosure has an outlet normally at a level midway along the two ducts. In use, superheated steam tending to pass downwardly along the ducts meets external air tending to pass upwardly along the ducts and forms within each duct a steam/air temperature and density differential stratification layer. These stratification layers act as barriers to the escape of steam from the enclosure and/or entry of air into the enclosure while at the same time<br><br>
2 permitting the free conveyance of material along the ducts and into and out of the enclosure.<br>
Specification No. 2281383 thus discloses a continuous drying process in which materials to be dried pass into and/or out of the drying enclosure through a non-mechanical barrier which allows the free passage of the materials without any significant restraint, while at the same time providing effectively substantially gas-tight seals to prevent the escape of superheated steam from the drying enclosure or the entry of air into the enclosure. Steam escaping through the vent duct may be condensed to recover its thermal energy.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a method of processing organic material comprising heating the organic material to a temperature exceeding 100°C in an atmosphere comprising at least one of superheated steam, a hot inert gas, hot air and hot process gases, and subsequently cooling the heated organic material in an atmosphere comprising at least one of superheated steam and an inert gas. The invention also relates to an apparatus designed to permit the use of the method in a relatively simple and convenient form.<br>
The present invention thus sets out to provide methods and apparatus for continuous, batch, or continuous sequenced batch processing of material, for example moist organic material, in superheated steam and other gases whereby the material to be processed either passes into and/or out of drying, processing and cooling enclosures respectively through non-mechanical barriers which allow the free passage of the material without any significant restraint, or through mechanical barriers in the form of doors able to be closed in airtight manner, said non-mechanical or mechanical barriers providing effectively substantially gas-tight seals to prevent the movement of superheated steam, hot process gases or inert cooling gas from or between the drying, processing or cooling enclosures, respectively, or the entry of air into said drying, processing and/or cooling enclosures, in order first to dry the moist material in superheated steam, then to process the dried material in hot process gases at a temperature higher than that required to dry it to alter its physical properties and/or its chemical composition while recovering or combusting components emitted from it as gases, and finally to cool the processed material's solid residues in an inert gas, preferably but not exclusively superheated steam, to a temperature typically slightly above 100°C but in any event below that at which said residues could ignite spontaneously on re-entering ambient air, or whereby said material to be processed is<br><br>
) t<br>
3	' placed as a batch in, and said batch is then dried, processed and cooled in at least one substantially airtight drying, processing and cooling enclosure.<br>
One form of said apparatus comprises a drying enclosure, at least one processing enclosure and a cooling enclosure, conveying means passing into and through said drying, processing and cooling enclosures and out of said cooling enclosure through ducts either communicating -with or linking said enclosures, said enclosures and said ducts being thermally insulated, whereby, except where mentioned hereafter, said enclosures and said ducts, and their junctions with said enclosures, are all airtight.<br>
During an initial warm-up period the drying enclosure is heated by recirculating the ambient air atmosphere initially contained in said drying enclosure over a heat source by recirculation fen means while moist material begins to be transported by said conveying means into and through the drying enclosure. The recirculating ambient air atmosphere is displaced and replaced by recirculating superheated steam generated from the moisture in the material by the known method described in Specification No. 2281383, whereby said recirculating superheated steam then completes the drying of the material and the additional steam generated from the moisture in said material is vented, preferably but not exclusively into condensing means, as described in Specification No. 2281383, before said material is transported out of the drying enclosure and into at least one processing enclosure.<br>
Before the dried material begins to be transported from the drying enclosure into the said at least one processing enclosure by the said conveying means, warm-up of the at least one processing enclosure is initiated by recirculating the ambient air atmosphere initially contained in said at least one processing enclosure over a heat source by means of *a recirculation fen and, once the temperature of the air in said at least one processing enclosure exceeds 100°C, said air may be displaced and replaced either by an externally provided inert gas atmosphere or, by temporarily venting some or all of the steam being generated in the drying enclosure via a dampered duct into said at least one processing enclosure instead of venting it into the said condensing or cooling means, by a superheated steam atmosphere, whereby said ambient air atmosphere, said externally provided inert gas atmosphere or said superheated steam atmosphere then contained in the at least one processing enclosure is heated to a temperature above that at which drying in superheated steam is proceeding in the said drying enclosure by recirculating it over said heat source and through said at least one processing enclosure by means of said recirculation fen.<br><br>
4<br>
As the dried material begins to be transported through said at least one processing enclosure and processed at said temperature above that at which drying in superheated steam is proceeding in said drying enclosure, hot process gases generated from said dried material displace and replace the air, inert gas or superheated steam atmosphere in said at least one processing enclosure, following which heating and processing of the said dried material proceeds by recirculating said hot process gases over said heat source and through said dried material in said at least one processing enclosure by said recirculation fan means, whereby said temperature above that at which drying in superheated steam is proceeding in the drying enclosure is maintained and the additional hot process gases generated from said dried material being transported through and processed in said at least one processing enclosure are vented either into condensing or cooling means or, when said additional hot process gases are combustible, into combustion means, while any combustible incondensible gases which emerge from said condensing or cooling means, if employed, are ducted into said combustion means, and the said heat source may be heated by the combustion gases generated by the combustion of said additional hot process gases and of said combustible incondensible gases, if any, in said combustion means.<br>
Before the hot solid residues remaining after hot process gases have been generated from said dried material begin to be transported from said at least one processing enclosure into said cooling enclosure by said conveying means, replacement of the ambient air atmosphere initially contained in the cooling enclosure may be carried out, either by recirculating the ambient air atmosphere initially contained in the cooling enclosure over said heat source by means of a recirculation fan in order to heat it or, for example, by heating said ambient air atmosphere by arranging for a portion of the flue gases emerging from the said heat source to enter the cooling enclosure whereby, once the temperature of the air or air with a portion of flue gas atmosphere in said cooling enclosure exceeds 100°C, said ambient air or air with a portion of flue gas atmosphere may be displaced and replaced by a superheated steam atmosphere by temporarily venting some or all of the additional steam being generated in the drying enclosure via dampered duct means into said cooling enclosure instead of venting it into said condensing or cooling means or, alternately, the said ambient air atmosphere initially contained in the cooling enclosure may be displaced and replaced by an externally provided inert gas atmosphere.<br><br>
5<br>
When the atmosphere in the cooling enclosure is ambient air, as the said hot solid residues are transported through the cooling enclosure's air atmosphere, limited combustion of a small portion of said solid residues occurs and the air atmosphere is displaced and replaced by the hot and virtually oxygen-free combustion gas produced. Thereafter said hot and virtually oxygen-free combustion gas is recirculated by recirculation fan means through said cooling enclosure and through condensing or cooling means in which any hot process gases generated from the hot solid residues are condensed and the said hot and virtually oxygen-free combustion gas cooled, whereby, on its return to said cooling enclosure, the thus cooled combustion gas in turn cools said hot solid residues before they are transported out of said cooling enclosure into ambient air by said conveying means.<br>
When the said atmosphere in said cooling enclosure is superheated steam, as the said hot solid residues are transported through said cooling enclosure's superheated steam atmosphere, said superheated steam is recirculated by fen means through said cooling enclosure into which atomised cooling water is injected by water atomising means, preferably but not exclusively into the eye of said fen means, at a rate sufficient to cool said superheated steam to slightly above 100°C, whereby the additional steam generated in the said cooling enclosure from the atomised water and any hot process gases generated from said hot solid residues are condensed in said condensing or cooling means while the thus cooled recirculating superheated steam in turn cools said hot solid residues before they are transported out of said cooling enclosure into ambient air by said conveying means.<br>
When the said atmosphere in said cooling enclosure is an inert gas other than superheated steam, as the said hot solid residues are transported through said cooling enclosure's inert gas atmosphere, said inert gas is recirculated by fen means through said cooling enclosure and through said condensing or cooling means in which condensable components in any further hot process gases generated from said solid residues are condensed and the inert gas and any incondensable components in any said further hot process gases cooled to slightfy above 100°C, whereby on their return to said cooling enclosure the thus cooled inert gas and any incondensable components in any said further hot process gases in turn cool said hot solid residues before they are transported out of said cooling enclosure into ambient air by said conveying means.<br>
After completion of said initial warm-up period, said conveying means continue to transport the moist material out of ambient air, upwards through a steam/air stratification<br><br>
6 layer seal and into and through the superheated steam atmosphere in said drying enclosure, while said conveying means continue to transport the dried material out of the superheated steam atmosphere in said drying enclosure, downwards through a steam/air stratification layer seal and through ambient air before transporting said dried material upwards through a hot process gases/air stratification layer seal and into and through the hot process gases atmosphere in said at least one processing enclosure, while said conveying means continue to transport the processed material's solid residues out of the hot process gas atmosphere in said at least one processing enclosure, downwards through a hot process gases/air stratification layer seal and through ambient air before transporting said solid residues upwards through either a virtually oxygen-free combustion gas/air, superheated steam/air or other inert gas/air stratification layer seal and into and through a slightly above 100°C combustion gas, superheated steam or other inert gas atmosphere in said cooling enclosure, while further conveying means transport the cooled residues out of the slightly above 100°C combustion gas, superheated steam or other inert gas atmosphere in the cooling enclosure, downwards through a combustion gas, superheated steam or other inert gas/air stratification layer seal and into ambient air, whereby the said steam/air, hot process gases/air and combustion gas, steam or other inert gas/air stratification layer seals, which prevent the escape of superheated steam, other hot process gases, combustion gas, superheated steam and/or other inert gas respectively from the drying, processing and cooling enclosures respectively or the entry of air into said enclosures, are created and maintained naturally due to the densities of the above 100°C steam, or process gases, or combustion gas, superheated steam or other inert gas atmospheres respectively above the said stratification layer seals being significantly less than that of ambient air, and the required above 100°C drying and processing temperatures of said superheated steam in said drying enclosure and of said hot process gases in said processing enclosure are maintained by continuing separately to recirculate said superheated steam and said hot process gases over said at least one heat source by said enclosures' respective recirculation fan means, while the required slightly above 100°C temperature of the said combustion gas, superheated steam or other inert gas in said cooling enclosure is maintained by heat transfer from the said hot solid residues being transported into and through said cooling enclosure, and the denser of said superheated steam in said drying enclosure, said hot process gases in said processing enclosure and said combustion gas, superheated steam or other inert gas in said cooling<br><br>
7 enclosure, all having differing densities below that of ambient air, are prevented by said steam/air, hot process gas/air and combustion gas, steam or other inert gas/air stratification layer seals from passing through said ducts linking said enclosures into an adjoining drying, processing or cooling enclosure.<br>
At the commencement of the initial warm-up period the heating medium employed in said at least one heat source is combustion gases produced in said combustion means by burning an externally supplied fuel, but during or after said initial warm-up period the use of such externally supplied fuel may be reduced or eliminated as and when the thermal energy released by combusting the hot process gases vented directly to the said combustion means from said at least one processing enclosure and/or the incondensible gases emerging from any or all of said at least one condensing or cooling means becomes sufficient or more than sufficient to reduce or eliminate the use of such externally supplied fuel, whereby if more than sufficient thermal energy is released by combusting the gases vented directly to the said combustion means from said at least one processing enclosure and/or the incondensible gases emerging from any or all of said at least one condensing or cooling means than is required by said at least one heat source then most of any excess combustion gases may be employed to heat additional apparatus, preferably but not exclusively apparatus similar to that hereinafter described.<br>
By way of example, if the material being dried and processed is wood and the cooled solid residues produced are charcoal, the thermal energy released by combusting the gases vented directly to said combustion means from said at least one processing enclosure and/or the incondensible gases emerging from any of the said at least one condensing or cooling means is more than sufficient to eliminate the use of said externally supplied fuel, whereby the excess thermal energy may be capable of drying and, if required, torrefying approximately twice as much wood as is processed to become charcoal in further drying, processing and cooling apparatus similar to that hereinafter described, or of being used to generate at least sufficient electrical energy to provide a portion o£ all or more than the electrical energy requirement of any said apparatus according to the invention.<br>
An alternate form of apparatus according to the invention comprises at least one drying, processing and cooling enclosure, each said drying, processing and cooling enclosure having a recirculation path within which an indirect heater, a recirculation fan, at least one container and an atomised water injection nozzle are located, whereby, in use, said<br><br>
g at least one container is loaded with moist material and inserted into said drying, processing and cooling enclosure through an access door which is then closed in airtight manner. Said moist material is then dried and processed and its solid residues cooled by first recirculating indirectly heated gases through said moist material in order to dry it, then recirculating gases indirectly heated to a higher temperature through the thus dried material in order advantageously to alter its physical properties and/or its chemical composition while recovering or usefully combusting components emitted from it as gases and then recirculating cooling gases through the resulting solid residues in order to cool them, all generally as heretofore described except that, instead of said material being transported by conveying means first into and out of a drying enclosure, then into and out of a processing enclosure and then, as solid residues, into and out of a cooling enclosure, the drying, processing and cooling phases take place within said drying, processing and cooling enclosure from which, when the cooling phase is complete and said access door is opened, said at least one container and said solid residues contained in said at least one container are removed from said drying, processing and cooling enclosure and replaced by a further at least one container loaded with moist material inserted into said drying, processing and cooling enclosure through said access door which is again closed in airtight manner, enabling the next drying phase to commence and, when more than one drying, processing and cooling enclosure is provided, the drying phases in each drying, processing and cooling enclosure preferably commence in sequence.<br>
A vent leads excess gases generated during the drying, cooling and processing phases respectively out of each said at least one drying, processing and cooling enclosure to atmosphere, either via a duct leading to atmosphere, or via a duct leading into and through an optional condenser, preferably but not exclusively common to all of said at least one drying, processing and cooling enclosures when more than one such enclosure is provided, or via a duct leading into a combustor, also preferably but not exchisivery common to all of said at least one drying, processing and cooling enclosures when more than one such enclosure is provided, and any incondensible gases passing through said optional condenser may be ducted into said combustor, whereby, in use, atmospheric pressure is effectively maintained in each said drying, processing and cooHng enclosure and valve or damper means direct said excess gases vented from each said drying, processing and cooling<br><br>
enclosure via a duct either directly to atmosphere, or indirectly to atmosphere through said optional condenser, or into said combustor.<br>
By way of example, when the combined duration of said drying and cooling phases is less than three times as long as the duration of the generation of excess process gases from said dried material during said processing phase and four of said drying, processing and cooling enclosures are provided and when said excess gases are combustible, by sequentially starting the drying, processing and cooling phases respectively in each of said four enclosures when less than two thirds of the combined duration of the drying and cooling phases taking place in the previously started enclosures has elapsed, the durations of the generation of excess process gases from said dried material during the processing phases taking place in at least two of said enclosures overlap. This ensures that said excess process gases are continuously vented into a preferably but not exclusively common combustor in which said excess process gases are continuously and cleanly combusted and from which the continuously produced combustion gases are ducted through a duct, either through at least two of said indirect heaters, one such indirect heater being located in each of said enclosures, to provide at least some of the thermal energy required by the drying and processing phases taking place sequentially in at least two of said enclosures or, if not so required, to atmosphere, while, if toxic emissions are not present in the excess gases generated and vented during the drying and cooling phases, said excess gases may either be vented directly to atmosphere or into an optional common condenser, but if toxic emissions are present in said excess gases then said excess gases are vented into said condenser to enable said toxic emissions to be cooled and condensed and the condensate and any incondensible gases emerging from said condenser to be de-toxified, whereby, as an alternative to venting said excess gases containing toxic emissions into said condenser, said excess gases may be vented into said combustor and said toxic emissions destroyed by combusting them therein.<br>
A further alternate form of apparatus for continuous processing of moist materials according to the invention comprises a loading enclosure, a drying enclosure, at least one processing enclosure, a cooling enclosure and an unloading enclosure, said loading enclosure, drying enclosure, at least one processing enclosure, cooling enclosure and unloading enclosure being separable from each other by means of preferably sliding, and when closed airtight doors and said loading enclosure and said unloading enclosure being<br><br>
10 separable from the exterior of said further alternate form of apparatus fay means of preferably sliding, and when closed airtight loading and unloading doors.<br>
Each said drying, processing and cooling enclosure has a separate recirculation path passing through it whereby, in use, individual containers loaded with moist material are conveyed sequentially first through said preferably sliding and when closed airtight loading door into said loading enclosure, then through one of said preferably sliding and when closed airtight doors into said drying enclosure within which said moist material is dried, then through another said preferably sliding and when closed airtight door into said at least one processing enclosure within which said dried material is processed, then through another said preferably sliding and when closed airtight door into said cooling enclosure within which said solid residues are cooled, then through another said preferably sliding and when closed airtight door into said unloading enclosure and then through said preferably sliding and when closed airtight unloading door, whereby, in use, while dried material is being processed in said processing enclosure, the venting of the excess gases generated from said dried material being processed into a combustor may enable the thermal energy generated by their combustion to provide at least some of the thermal energy required for the drying and processing of said moist material.<br>

to the invention-Referring to FIG. 1, there is shown diagrammatically in plan view an outline representation of an apparatus for continuous drying of moist organic material in superheated steam, processing the dried material in hot process gases and cooling its hot soHd residues in an inert gas, preferably but not exclusively superheated steam, comprising a drying enclosure 1, at least one processing enclosure 2 and a cooling enclosure 3, conveying means 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 passing into and through said enclosures 1,2 and 3 respectively and conveying means 4.4 passing out of said enclosure 3 through not shown ducts, said ducts either communicating with or linking said enclosures 1, 2 and 3, said enclosures 1, 2 and 3 and said not shown ducts being thermally insulated, whereby, except where mentioned hereafter by reference to FIG's 2 to 10, said enclosures 1, 2 and 3 and said not shown ducts, and their junctions with said enclosures at the locations indicated by 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5 and 8.6, are all airtight.<br>
During an initial warm-up period the drying enclosure 1 is heated by recirculating the ambient air atmosphere initially contained in said drying enclosure 1 over at least one indirect heater 7 by means of a not shown recirculation fan while moist material begins to be transported by conveying means 4.1 into and through the drying enclosure 1 in which the recirculating ambient air atmosphere is displaced and replaced by recirculating superheated steam generated from the moisture in the material by the known method described in Specification No. 2281383, said recirculating superheated steam then completing the drying of the material as described in Specification No. 2281383 before it is transported out of the drying enclosure 1 and into the at least one processing enclosure 2 by the conveying means 4.2, whereby, in use, the additional steam generated from the moisture in said material is vented, preferably but not exclusively into a condenser or cooler 5.1.<br>
Before the dried material begins to be transported from the drying enclosure 1 into the at least one processing enclosure 2 by the conveying means 4.2, warm-up of said at least one processing enclosure 2 is initiated by recirculating the ambient air atmosphere initially contained in said at least one processing enclosure 2 over at least one indirect heater 7 by means of a not shown recirculation fan and, once the temperature of the air in said processing enclosure 2 exceeds 100°C, said air may be displaced and replaced either by an externally provided inert gas atmosphere or, by temporarily venting some or all of the steam<br><br>
12	/<br>
being generated in the drying enclosure 1 via a not shown dampered duct into said at least one processing enclosure 2 instead of venting it preferably but not exclusively into said condenser or cooler 5.1, by a superheated steam atmosphere, whereby, in use, said air, said externally provided inert gas atmosphere or said superheated steam atmosphere then contained in said at least one processing enclosure 2 is heated to a temperature above that at which drying in superheated steam is proceeding in drying enclosure 1 by recirculating said externally provided inert gas atmosphere or said superheated steam atmosphere over the at least one indirect heater 7 and through said at least one processing enclosure 2 by means of said not shown recirculation fan.<br>
As the dried material begins to be transported through said at least one processing enclosure 2 and processed at said temperature above that at which drying in superheated steam is proceeding in drying enclosure 1, hot process gases generated from said dried material displace and replace the air, inert gas or superheated steam atmosphere in said at least one processing enclosure 2, following which heating and processing of the said dried material proceeds by recirculating said hot process gases over said at least one indirect heater 7 and through said dried material in said at least one processing enclosure 2 by means of said not shown recirculation fan, whereby, in use, said temperature above that at which drying in superheated steam is proceeding in drying enclosure 1 is maintained and the additional hot process gases generated from said dried material being transported through and processed in said at least one processing enclosure 2 are vented either into a condenser or cooler S.2 or, when said additional hot process gases are combustible, into a combustor 6, while any combustible incondensible gases which emerge from any said condenser or cooler 5.2 are ducted into said combustor 6, and said at least one indirect heater 7 may be heated by the combustion gases generated by the combustion of said additional hot process gases and the said combustible incondensible gases in said combustor 6.<br>
Before the hot solid residues remaining after hot process gases have been generated from said dried material begin to be transported from said at least one processing enclosure 2 into the cooling enclosure 3 by the conveying means 4.3, replacement of the ambient air atmosphere initially contained in said cooling enclosure 3 may be carried out, either by recirculating said ambient air atmosphere initially contained in said cooling enclosure 3 over said at least one indirect heater 7 by means of a not shown recirculation fan in order to heat it or, for example, by heating said ambient air atmosphere by arranging for a portion of the<br><br>
13	'■'"■,./<br>
flue gases emerging from said at least one indirect heater 7 to enter said cooling enclosure<br>
3, whereby, in use, once the temperature of the air or air with a portion of flue gas in said<br>
cooling enclosure 3 exceeds 100°C, said ambient air or air with a portion of flue gas<br>
atmosphere may be displaced and replaced by a superheated steam atmosphere by<br>
temporarily venting some or all of the additional steam being generated in said drying<br>
enclosure 1 via a not shown dampered duct into said cooling enclosure 3 instead of venting<br>
said additional steam preferably into said condenser or cooler 5.1 or, alternately, the said<br>
