				<td>COMPOSITION FOR PREPARING RIGID POLYURETHANE FOAM<br>
HAVING GOOD DEMOLDING PROPERTY<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a rigid polyurethane foam composition,<br>
and particularly, to a composition for preparing a rigid polyurethane foam having<br>
superior demolding property by defining polyols and reaction catalysts, and<br>
reducing post-expansion rate after foaming without damaging other physical<br>
properties.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Generally, a rigid polyurethane foam is obtained by reacting a polyol<br>
component and an isocyanate component under existences of reaction catalysts,<br>
a foam blowing agent and a foam stabilizer. The rigid polyurethane foam is a<br>
heat insulating material having the highest heat insulating property among<br>
organic and inorganic thermal insulators, and is used a lot in a refrigerator, a<br>
freezing container, a low temperature storage, etc. which require a higher heat<br>
insulating property. That is because the polyurethane foam consists of closed<br>
cells to have a higher heat insulating property, and a low density foam can be<br>
prepared by controlling a used amount and kind of the foam blowing agent.<br>
However, a polyurethane foam having lower density and thermal conductivity<br>
than that usually used, and having a good plasticity is highly required.<br>
Generally, the rigid polyurethane foam is needed to be hardened in a<br>
foaming jig (mold) under a predetermined temperature range (40°C~55°C) for<br><br>
a predetermined time after a raw solution is injected. In addition, a difference in<br>
post-expansion rate when demolding in the jig is generated according to the<br>
hardening time. The post-expansion rate after foam blowing of the polyurethane<br>
foam is directly related to size and changing amount of the refrigerator products,<br>
and basically, the amount of post-expansion after the foam blowing is increased<br>
in proportion to the size and thickness.<br>
However, as the produced amount of the refrigerator is increased, as<br>
structure and size of the product become complex and large, and as quality<br>
control of the products becomes rigid, it is required that the expansion rate of the<br>
foam and the hardening time are reduced. However, it can not be realized by the<br>
conventional polyurethane foam, and the number of jig is increased, and thereby,<br>
the producing cost is increased.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide components<br>
of raw solution having improved demolding property and to provide composition<br>
for preparing a rigid polyurethane foam including the same by minimizing post-<br>
expansion rate in demolding from a jig (mold), as maintaining physical properties<br>
and characteristics (heat insulating function, density, dimensional changing rate,<br>
compression intensity, etc.) required as a thermal insulating material to be same<br>
level.<br>
To achieve the above object of the present invention, there is provided<br>
composition for preparing a rigid polyurethane foam having superior demolding<br>
property with minimized post-expansion rate in demolding, by controlling<br><br>
components and contents of polyols and reaction catalysts in the composition<br>
for the rigid polyurethane comprising reaction catalysts, a chemical foam blowing<br>
dichlorofluoroethane<br>
agent (water), a physical foam blowing agent/(HCFC-141b), an isocyanate, and<br>
a few important polyols.<br>
The composition for preparing a rigid polyurethane according to the<br>
present invention comprises following components:<br>
- a mixed polyol 100 weight parts comprising 40~60 wt.% of polyol (a)<br>
which is obtained by polymerization with alkylene oxide using sorbitol as an<br>
initiator, 5~10 wt.% of polyol (b) which is obtained by polymerization with<br>
alkylene oxide using ethylene diamine as an initiator, 20~30 wt.% of polyol (c)<br>
which is obtained by polymerization with alkylene oxide using toluene diamine<br>
or a mixture of toluene diamine and triethanol amine as a single or complex<br>
initiator, and 5~20 wt.% of multivalent polyol of an ester structure, on a basis of<br>
total weight of mixed polyol (herein, the amount of each polyol is determined<br>
within the above each range so that total wt.% of polyols a, b, c and d could<br>
amount to 100),<br>
- 1.6 ~ 3.5 weight parts of reaction catalysts,<br>
-10 ~ 50 weight parts of a foam blowing agent,<br>
- 1.5 ~ 2.5 weight parts of water, and<br>
-150 ~ 170 weight parts of organic isocyanates.<br>
Also, the present invention relates to a rigid polyurethane foam fabricated<br>
from the above composition for the rigid polyurethane foam.<br>
The present invention uses a mixed polyol of a certain composition,<br>
reaction catalyst, and the foam blowing agent such as a certain amount of water<br>
and HCFC-141b. The rigid polyurethane foam obtained from above composition<br>
according to the present invention has a low post-expansion rate after demolding<br>
as maintaining other physical properties such as thermal insulating function, etc.,<br>
and therefore, has a superior plasticity. Therefore, it is very useful for applying<br>
to the refrigerator.<br>
Most polyols used in general rigid polyurethane are polyhydric alcohol<br>
having an ether structure (C-O-C), and these are obtained by polymerization with<br>
an organic oxide using a compound having two or more active hydrogen as an<br>
initiator.<br>
In case that general alkylene oxide (AO) is used as the above organic<br>
oxide, ethylene oxide (EO), propylene oxide (PO) and a mixture thereof are used<br>
in general, and these can be used in the present invention.<br>
The mixed polyol used in the present invention consists of a polyol which<br>
is obtained by polymerization with an alkylene oxide using sorbrtol of hexa-valent<br>
functional group as an initiator (polyol a), a polyol which is obtained by<br>
polymerization with an alkylene oxide using ethylene diamine (EDA) of tetravalent<br>
of functional group as an initiator (polyol b), a polyol which is obtained by<br>
polymerization with an alkylene oxide using toluene diamine (TDA) of tetra-valent<br>
functional group as a single initiator or a mixture of TDA and triethanol amine<br>
(TEOA) of tri-valent functional group as a complex initiator (polyol c), and a<br>
multivalent polyol having an ester structure (C-O-O) (polyol d).<br>
It is desirable that the component content of the mixed polyol in the<br>
present invention is 40-60 wt.% of polyol a using the sorbitol as an initiator, 5-10<br><br>
wt.% of polyol b using EDA as an initiator, 20~30 wt.% of polyol c using TDA or<br>
a mixture of TDA and TEOA as a initiator, and 5~20 wt.% of polyol d having an<br>
ester structure. Herein, the amount of each polyol is determined within the above<br>
each range so that total wt.% of polyols a, b, c and d could amount to 100.<br>
The reaction catalysts used in the present invention can be classified into<br>
three kinds, that is, a foaming catalyst for controlling polyurethane major<br>
reaction, a gelling catalyst, and a trimerization catalyst. General pentamethylene<br>
diethylene triamine (PMDETA) can be used as the foaming catalyst affecting to<br>
reactivity of the foam, and dimethyl cyclohexyl amine (DMCHA) can be used as<br>
the gelling catalyst. Relevancy and reactivity between the twocatalysts should<br>
be set appropriately under actual using conditions, and thereby, these catalysts<br>
can affect to the flow and hardness of the foam. Especially, in case that the<br>
polyol controls the flow of the foam as in the present invention, the foaming<br>
catalyst type should be reduced. Also, in the present invention, the trimerization<br>
catalyst may be used additionally, and a mixed catalyst in which the foaming<br>
catalyst and the gelling catalyst are mixed at appropriate ratio may be used, in<br>
this case, preferable mixing ratio (foaming catalyst : gelling catalyst, w/w) is in<br>
a range of 1:1~1:3.<br>
The foaming catalyst is used by the amount of 0.3~0.7 weight parts, the<br>
gelling catalyst is used by the amount of 1.0~1.5 weight parts, and the<br>
trimerization catalyst is used by the amount of 0.3~0.5 weight parts in case of<br>
using per polyol 100 weight parts. Also, in case that the mixed catalyst of the<br>
foaming catalyst and the gelling catalyst is used, the catalyst is used by the<br>
amount of 2.0~3.0 weight parts per polyol 100 weight parts. In economic aspect,<br>
it is desirable that the foaming catalyst which has relative high price is reduced.<br>
In the present invention, the organic isocyanate is used as it is used in<br>
general polyurethane. For example, diphenylmethane diisocyanate (polymeric<br>
MDI) can be used. An index (NCO/OH) for an optical foam is about 1.1~1.2, and<br>
the isocyanate is used by the amount of 15CM7Q weight parts per polyol 100<br>
weight parts.<br>
In the present invention, water is used as a chemical foam blowing agent,<br>
and injected by the amount of 1.5~2.5 weight parts per polyol 100 weight parts.<br>
The HCFC-141b is used as a physical foam blowing agent, and injected by the<br>
amount of about 10~50 weight parts per polyol 100 weight parts.<br>
In addition, a surface active agent may be used in the rigid polyurethane<br>
foam composition of the present invention, and, in this case, a silicon surface<br>
active agent which is used in general rigid polyurethane can be used. The<br>
surface active agent in the present invention reduces a surface tension to<br>
improve miscibility, uniformizes the size of generated pores, and stablizes the<br>
generated foam by controlling pore structure of the foam. In case that the silicon<br>
surface active agent is used in the present invention, it is used by the amount<br>
of 1.0 ~3.0 weight parts per polyol 100 weight parts.<br>
Also, the composition for the rigid polyurethane foam may further includes<br>
one or more additives, such as an ignition delay agent, a filler, a strengthened<br>
fiber, and a colorant.<br>

Results of measuring physical properties for the above samples are<br>
shown in table 1, and the physical properties in table 1 were measured as<br>
follows:<br>
- Just Pack: the amount of polyurethane foam when it is precisely filled<br>
in a predetermined volume when a raw solution is injected into a predetermined<br>
mold, measured by an electronic scale<br>
- reactivity: a major reaction time of the foam (a time point when fiber is<br>
attached to a bar, when a bar is put into the foam in reaction) measured by a<br>
stop watch<br>
- free rise density : density of a foam which is foamed in an opened<br>
chamber without being locked in a mold measured by a scale and a device for<br>
measuring dimensions<br>
- k-factor : generally represented as l, a thermal conductivity of the foam<br>
measured by Auto-l.<br>
- core density : density of a foam which is foamed in a predetermined<br>
moid except outer surface portion measured by an electronic scale and a device<br>
for measuring dimensions<br>
- compression strength : a compression strength of foam measured by<br>
a universal testing machine (UTM)<br>
- dimension changing rate : changes in dimensions according to<br>
environment changing (low temperature, high temperature, or high temperature<br>
and high humidity). The environmental changes of the form were caused by a<br>
thermohydrostat (Korean product, foreign made), and the dimensions before and<br>
after the change were measured by using a device for measuring dimensions,<br><br>
to calculate the changing rate<br>
- post expansion rate: an expanded degree of the foam when the foam<br>
is taken out from a mold (demolding) before the foam is totally hardened in the<br>
mold (demolding time is reduced), measured as follows,<br>
CD Just pack of the raw solution in a mold (jig) of reference size is<br>
measured.<br>
(2) The raw solution is injected into the mold as over-packing (more than<br>
20%) on a basis of above measured just pack.<br>
(3) A center of the foam is expanded because the hardening time is<br>
shortened than a standard hardening time (staying time in the mold), and the<br>
expanded amount comparing to a standard thickness (mold thickness), when<br>
the foam is demolded, is measured using a device for measuring dimensions to<br>
calculate the expansion rate.<br>
[table 1]<br>
The rigid polyurethane foam fabricated from the above composition<br>
according to the present invention is able to maintain the required physical<br>
properties (thermal insulating function, strength, dimension changing rate, etc.)<br>
as a thermal insulating material. In addition, according to the present invention,<br><br>
the post-expansion rate is reduced, and thereby, the changed amount of outer<br>
dimension and the demoiding time are reduced to improve productivity of the<br>
form. Especially, as in examples 1 and 3, according to the compositions in which<br>
the polyol advantageous to flow is included and the catalyst of foaming agent<br>
type of high cost is reduced, the cost-saving effect for the thermal insulating<br>
material can be obtained. Therefore, preferable compositions are the above<br>
examples 1 and 3.<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
As described above, according to the composition for preparing the rigid<br>
polyurethane foam of the present invention, the rigid polyurethane foam which<br>
is able to maintain required physical properties to be same levels as those of the<br>
conventional art, and to minimize post-expansion rate can be fabricated. In<br>
addition, as the post-expansion rate is minimized, hardening time in a foaming<br>
jig after the raw solution is injected, and thereby the productivity can be<br>
increased when the polyurethane foam is applied to the refrigerator, etc.. Also,<br>
since the changed amount of the foam can be reduced when it is applied to<br>
various products, the size of the product can be managed precisely, and<br>
therefore, industrial applicability of the present invention is superior to<br>
conventional art.<br>
As the present invention may be embodied in several forms without<br>
departing from the spirit or essential characteristics thereof, it should also be<br>
understood that the above-described embodiments are not limited by any of the<br>
details of the foregoing description, unless otherwise specified, but rather should<br><br>
