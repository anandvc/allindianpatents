				<td>Electric Motor-Driven Water Craft, Which is Cooled by the Surrounding Water<br>
The invention relates to a motor-driven watercraft, having a body of the craft, on which the user at least partially rests or stands, having a flow channel extending through the body of the craft containing a screw driven by an electric motor, wherein the electric motor and batteries, as well as a control device for the electric motor and the screw, are at least partially housed in the flow channel.<br>
A motor-driven watercraft of this type is known from WO 96/30087.  In this case, the user lies on the body of the craft and the screw in the flow channel is driven by a battery-fed electric motor in such a way that a water flow, which runs opposite the movement direction of the watercraft, is moved by suction through the flow channel.<br>
In this way the water flow can be kept away from the user, and by means of the shape of the body of the craft, the water flow can be conducted past the user.  This makes swimming and diving with the motor-driven watercraft easier.<br>
The embodiment of the motor-driven watercraft is of a complicated design and, considered from the viewpoint of maintenance, not user-friendly.  The electric motor is coupled to the screw by means of a gear.  The electric motor is cooled inside the body of the craft in order to maintain its efficiency. The effectiveness of such a motor-driven watercraft is relatively limited.  Further than that, it has a large weight because of the complicated structure and therefore becomes hard to handle.<br>
It is' the object of the invention to create a motor-driven<br>
watercraft of the above mentioned type, which has a high degree<br>
of<br>
efficiency.<br>
The object of the invention is attained in that the batteries are housed in a watertight housing and are in a heat-conducting contact, at least over portions, with the housing, that the housing consists at least partially of a material capable of conducting heat, and that the housing is in a heat-conducting contact with the flowing water.<br>
It should be expressly stated at this point that<br>
rechargeable batteries are also understood to fall under the term "batteries".  In this case the great amount of heat necessarily being generated in the batteries at a high output from the electric motor can be dependably transferred to the water in a simple manner.  It is available as a practically unlimited coolant reservoir.<br>
To allow a good heat transfer to the water, it can be preferably provided for the housing to be made at least partially of aluminum.  In this connection the aluminum material is sufficiently corrosion-resistant, in particular in the area exposed to seawater.  In accordance with a possible variation of the invention for remaining sufficiently dependable in their application also in case of damage, it has been provided for the batteries to have a voltage of less than or equal to 60 V.  In this case cooling in accordance with the invention is particularly suitable for removing the generated heat, which is explained in the example below.<br>
At an output of 4 kW at the driveshaft and an approximate total efficiency of the drive system of 85% (90% motor + 5% electronic devices = 85% total), the output taken from the batteries is 4.7 kW.  The entire system heats up at 45 V / over<br>
100 A of a possible continuous current flow.  This means that 700 W must be well cooled in spite of the high degree of technical efficiency achieved.<br>
A further embodiment of the invention can be distinguished in that the housing with the batteries is arranged at least in part in the area of the flow channel.  A large volume flow of cooling water exists in this area, which aids effective cooling.<br>
In accordance with a further preferred embodiment of the invention it can be provided for the housing with the batteries to be arranged in a recess formed in the underside of the body of the craft, which is arranged at least partially outside of the flow channel and the inflow opening of the flow channel, and that the housing is partially arranged in flowing water on the port and starboard side and/or the side of the keel.  A large-area water flow is possible with this arrangement.<br>
The counterbalanced weight arrangement of the motor-driven watercraft in view of an optimum center of gravity can be aided in a simple manner in that the housing extends in the direction toward the bow around the center area formed between bow and stern of the body of the craft.<br>
The batteries are easily accessible or removable for the recharging process and can be replaced by a fresh housing containing batteries.  The batteries of the removed housing can be recharged.  In a user-friendly way, the motor-driven watercraft is always ready for use in this way, which is of particular advantage to rental agencies.  The housing for the batteries is watertight and preferably also has a watertight charging jack.<br>
A permanent operation at high efficiency can also be assured in connection with a motor-driven watercraft in accordance with the species if it has been provided that the electric motor has been designed with an internal rotor, that the stator of the electric motor is in heat-conducting contact with a<br>
receiver housing of the electric motor by means of a heat-conducting unit, that in the area assigned to the heat-conducting unit the receiver housing consists at least in part of a material capable of conducting heat, and that the receiver housing is arranged at least partially in the flow channel.  An electric motor designed in this way can transfer its heat to the flowing water.  Here, the heat conductivity provides a definite and rapid heat removal.  It is also possible with this arrangement to omit additional cooling devices, which considerably reduces the parts layout for the motor-driven craft.  The electronic control device having the electronic switching arrangement and, if required, output elements, can be cooled in the water in the same way.<br>
The electronic device and the motor preferably constitute a unit, in which these units can be thermally coupled, if desired. It can be provided in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention for the heat-conducting unit to be made of a heat- conducting casting compound, which is in a material-to-material contact with the receiver housing.<br>
Good heat transfer between the stator and the receiver housing of the electric motor is created in this way.<br>
In order to be able to refit the electric motor in a simple way for different output stages, it can be provided that the housing of the electric motor constitutes a stator receptacle, in which stators in the form of kits which are different, can be installed, wherein the stators have differing extensions, corresponding to different output ranges, in the direction of the axis of the driveshaft of the rotor.<br>
Dependable sealing of the receiver housing is obtained in that the rotor and the stator are housed in the receiver housing, which is sealed water-tight against its surroundings, that the driveshaft is conducted from the receiver housing through a sealing cassette, that the sealing cassette seals the driveshaft by means of at least two sealing rings, and that the sealing<br>
cassette can be adjustably arranged in the axial direction in different mounting positions in respect to the driveshaft.  The movable sealing cassette makes it possible to assign the sealing rings to different areas of the shaft.  This becomes necessary if, after a defined length of operations, the sealing rings have worked themselves into the surface of the driveshaft and a danger of leakage then arises.<br>
The service life of the driveshaft can be increased in that the surface of the running face of the driveshaft on which the sealing rings run off is improved, for example coated with a mechanically resistant material.<br>
Simple leakage monitoring is possible if a leakage sensor is arranged between two sealing rings, or preferably downstream of the redundant sealing rings.<br>
In accordance with the invention it is also possible to provide a combination of the screw, electric motor and control device for the electric motor into an underwater unit, and to place it into the flow channel.  This results in a substantial reduction in the structure of the parts for the body of the craft, in particular, and for the maintenance of the motor-driven watercraft.<br>
If in accordance with an embodiment it has been provided that the body of the craft has a resting surface or a platform for the user, it can be employed in two ways.  The construction can be further simplified in that the flow channel is formed in one piece out of the body of the craft.<br>
An embodiment has proven to be particularly advantageous which is distinguished in that the flow channel starts with an inflow opening in the area of the bow of the body of the craft and terminates with an outflow opening in the area of the stern of the body of the craft, and that the underwater drive unit is installed in the flow channel as a thrust and suction device.<br>
An embodiment is advantageous for the two different types<br>
of use of the motor-driven watercraft for prone or standing operation which is distinguished in that a remote control device is assigned to the underwater drive unit which is releasably attached to the body of the craft and can be brought into operative connection with the control device of the underwater unit by means of a radio link.<br>
For simple maintenance or repair of the underwater drive unit it has been additionally provided that the body of the craft has a plate, flap or the like underneath the underwater drive unit in the flow channel, by means of which access to the underwater unit is provided.<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment variation of the invention it can be provided that a flow stator is assigned to the screw upstream or downstream in the flow channel in the flow direction, which straightens the rotating water flow in the flow channel at least partially.  The flow stator picks up the rotating movement of the water accelerated by the screw and converts it into an additional thrusting force.  The stream of water generated strikes the surrounding water without a thrusting-force-reducing spiral rotary flow, which results in an effective operation of great efficiency.  The flow stator is preferably fixedly connected directly with the body of the craft.<br>
A simple construction of the flow stator results if it is provided that the flow stator has a plurality of guide vanes, which are concentrically arranged in the flow channel.  The guide vanes can be arranged around a cone in a manner advantageous for the flow.<br>
For achieving an optimal acceleration of the water moved in the flow channel it can be provided that the flow stator is arranged in the area of a water outlet nozzle (diffuser), which tapers in cross section, of the flow channel.<br>
The invention will be explained in greater detail in what follows by means of an exemplary embodiment of a motor-driven<br><br>
watercraft represented in the drawings.  Shown are in:<br>
Fig. 1, the motor-driven watercraft in a lateral view, and Fig. 2, an electric motor of the motor-driven watercraft in a lateral view and in section.<br>
The exterior contours of the body 10 of the craft substantially correspond to the exterior contours of the motor-driven watercraft known from WO 96/30087.<br>
The flow channel 8 extends from the inflow opening 11 in the area of the bow as far as the outflow opening 12 in the area of the stern of the body 10 of the craft.  In this case, the inflow opening 11 extends, starting at a center area of the body 10 of the craft, in the direction toward the bow.  An underwater drive unit consisting of a flow stator 1, electric motor 3, screw 2 and motor control device 4 has been installed in the flow channel 8, which is slightly downwardly curved in the area of the inflow opening 11 and the outflow opening 12.  In the present case the flow stator 1 is fixedly connected with the body 10 of the craft.  It has the job of directing the rotating water flow generated in the flow channel 8 straight ahead, with as little rotation as possible.  An increase in efficiency is achieved by this.  The motor-driven watercraft can be designed in such a way that it can be employed in flowing water without reservation. The body 10 of the craft can be freely designed outside of the flow channel 8 and can be designed as simply as possible, but advantageous in respect to flow, and as user-friendly as possible.<br>
The flow channel can be formed in one piece in the body 10 of the craft.  In the present exemplary embodiment the flow channel 8 is formed from an upper shell 10.1 and a lower shell 10.2.  The components are connected with each other by means of suitable fastening means.  The flow channel 8 is made accessible for maintenance of the underwater drive unit by removing the lower shell 10.2.  However, it is also possible to provide a<br>
plate, flap, or the like underneath the underwater drive unit, by means of which access to the underwater drive unit is provided. A recess 13 has been formed in the underside of the body 10 of the craft in the area of the bow of the upper shell 10.1, into which a housing 9 with the batteries 5 and 6 has been releasably inserted.  The housing 9 with the rechargeable batteries 5 and 6 can be easily and quickly exchanged and can be replaced by a housing 9 with charged batteries 5 and 6, so that the motor-driven watercraft is always capable of being operated.<br>
The area of the inflow opening 11 of the flow channel 8 can be covered by means of the housing 9 in such a way that free access to the rotor 2 is prevented, but water can be conveyed at a sufficient flow volume.  By means of this simple step it has been achieved that the rotor 2 can only be accessed when the housing 9 has been removed, i.e. when the electric motor 3 is currentless.<br>
It can also be provided that access to the flow channel 8 is prevented by means of blocking elements arranged in the area of the inflow and/or outflow opening.<br>
Along both its sides (port and starboard) and on the side of the keel, the housing 9 is exposed to flowing water and can be optimally cooled there in order to prevent impermissible heating of the batteries 5 and 6 during operation.<br>
If the user lies prone on the body 10 of the craft, he can hold onto grip elements 7 or recessed grips.  Operating elements of a manual control device 14 have been integrated into one or both grip elements 7.<br>
It is also possible to provide a wireless remote control device.  This is connected with the motor control device 4 via a radio link.  The manual control device 14, which communicates with the motor control device 4, is maintained on the body 10 of the craft within the field of view of the user.  If the user is standing on the body 10 of the craft, the manual control device<br>
14 can be released from the body 10 of the craft and used. Various operational states, for example the actual speed, the diving depth or the charge state of the batteries 5 and 6 can be displayed on it.<br>
The electric motor is designed with an internal rotor.  It has been installed directly in the flow channel 8 and its heat is dissipated there to the flowing water, such as will be explained in greater detail later.<br>
The motor control device, which can have the electronic output device and/or a microprocessor, can also be arranged in the flow channel 8 and can be cooled there.  Alternatively, the motor control device 4 can also be arranged in the water outside of the flow channel 8.<br>
The electric motor 3 is represented in detail in Fig. 2. In accordance with this, the electric motor 3 has a driveshaft 3.1, which is seated by means of two bearings 3.2.  At one shaft end, the driveshaft 3.1 is provided with a seating section on which the screw 2 is mounted.  In this case the screw 2 is held on the driveshaft 3.1 by means of a base body 2.1.  The base body 2.1 has plug-in receivers, into which the screw blades 2.2 have been inserted.<br>
A cover 2.3 has been used for fixing the screw blades 2.2 in place in the plug-in receivers.  It is screwed together with the base body 2.1 (screw connection 2.4).<br>
At the end, the driveshaft 3.1 has a threaded section 3.4. A nut can be screwed on it and the screw 2 can be fixed in this way.<br>
The screw supports a rotor 20 of the drive motor designed with an internal rotor.  A fixed stator 21 is assigned to it. The stator 21 is cast together with the inner wall of a receiver housing 3.5 by means of a heat-conducting unit 22 made of a casting compound.<br>
The receiver housing 3.5 can be closed off by means of a<br>
housing cover 3.10 arranged on the side of the driveshaft 3.1 facing away from the screw 2.  A housing element 3.6 closes the receiver housing 3.5 off on the side facing away from the housing cover 3.10 (screw connection 3.7).  The housing cover 3.10 and the housing element 3.6 have bearing receivers for the two bearings 3.2.<br>
A stator receiver 3.11 has been formed in the receiver housing 3.5.  It extends over a larger area than the one covered by the stator 21.  This type of construction also permits the installation of larger stators 21 (and rotors 20), so that varying output variations can be created.<br>
In the area of the housing element 3.6, a parts housing 30 has been placed in a bell-like fashion over the driveshaft 3.1. A sealing cassette 40 is arranged inside the space enclosed by the parts housing 30.  It surrounds the driveshaft 3.1 and seals it by means of three sealing rings 3.3 (radial sealing rings). The sealing cassette 40 is sealing connected with the housing element 3.6 with by interposition of a spacer 3.8 (screw connection 3.9).<br>
The parts housing 30 is sealingly connected with the receiver housing 3.5.  For this purpose, the parts housing 30 is clamped together with the sealing cassette 40 (screw connection 45) .<br>
As Fig. 2 shows, spaces have been arranged in the area between the sealing rings 3.3, into which sensors, which can be mounted in sensor receivers 41, project.  They detect water penetrating in case of a leakage.<br>
To prevent the sealing rings 3.3 from working themselves into the associated running face of the driveshaft 3.1, the spacer 3.8 can be replaced after a set length of operation by a spacer 3.8 of a different thickness.  The sealing rings 3.3 then get into an unused area of the shaft.  As can be further seen in Fig. 2, it is also possible to displace only the sealing ring 3.3 facing to screw 2 (spacer 43)<br><br><br><br><br>
