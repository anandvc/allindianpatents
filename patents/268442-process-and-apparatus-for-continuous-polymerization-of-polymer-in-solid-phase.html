				<td>Process and apparatus for continuous polymerization of<br>
polymer in solid phase<br>
The invention relates to a process for continuous<br>
polymerization as claimed in claim 1 and an apparatus<br>
for carrying out the process as claimed in claim 11.<br>
Polyester and polyamide polymers are prepared in batch-<br>
wise or continuous polymerizations in the liquid phase<br>
(melt phase, MP), e.g. DE 103 22 106.9A1.<br>
To increase their viscosity and/or to achieve<br>
particular properties, the polymer produced in this<br>
way, which is present in particle form, in particular<br>
pellet form or powder form, is subjected to a solid-<br>
state polymerization (SSP).<br>
This occurs, in particular, in the preparation of poly-<br>
ester polymers for the production of bottles and high-<br>
strength threads. Here, a base polymer having an<br>
intrinsic viscosity (I.V.) of, for example, from<br>
0.30 dl/g to 0.65 dl/g is prepared in the melt: phase.<br>
One possible way of determining the intrinsic viscosity<br>
is a measurement in phenol/dichlorobenzene (60:40) at<br>
25 +/- 0.01°C.<br>
The pellets produced in this way are subsequently<br>
subjected to a solid-state polymerization in which the<br>
viscosity is increased to, for example, from 0.80 to<br>
&gt; 1.0 I.V. and the acetaldehyde (AA) content is reduced<br>
to less than 1 ppm.<br>
A similar procedure is employed in the solid-state<br>
polymerization of Nylon 6, where, for example, pellets<br>
having a relative viscosity (e.g. measured in 96% H2S04,<br>
1% by weight, at 25 +/- °C) of 2.4 or 2,7 is<br>
polymerized to a higher viscosity, e.g. 3.2 or 4.0 or<br>
above.<br><br>
In the processes known hitherto, the pellets from the<br>
melt phase are cooled a liter pelletization and stored.<br>
The pelletized material is subsequently reheated,<br>
partially crystallized (:.n the case of polyester) and<br>
dried, subsequently made uniform in further<br>
crystallizations<br><br>
and reaction stages and subsequently polymerized in a<br>
fixed-bed reactor.<br>
In the method of preparing polyesters which is<br>
described in DE 10 2004 015 515 Al, the polymer<br>
prepared in the melt phase is not cooled after<br>
pelletization and crystallized without further<br>
introduction of heat, purely by the latent heat of the<br>
polymer.<br>
The solid-state polymerization which follows these<br>
processes is carried out under an inert gas atmosphere,<br>
e.g. nitrogen or CO2, to avoid damage to the product by<br>
atmospheric oxygen and to remove the process vapors<br>
formed from the system.<br>
The fixed-bed reactors are usually upright vessels in<br>
which the product to be treated, viz. the pelletized<br>
material, flows under its own weight from the top<br>
downward and the gas flows in countercurrent from the<br>
bottom upward. The gas is preheated to the necessary<br>
working temperature.<br>
In another apparatus (WO 2004/018541 Al), the<br>
polymerization is carried out in the solid state in a<br>
horizontal, rotating reactor. The process vapors to be<br>
removed are likewise carried away by means of nitrogen.<br>
Since nitrogen is expensive, the reactor is operated in<br>
the recycle mode. The materials given off from the<br>
product in the solid-state polymerization (SSP) , e.g.<br>
ethylene glycol, acetaldehydes, water and other<br>
undesirable vapors and gases, are taken up by the inert<br>
gas and have to be removed from the gas circuit by<br>
means of complicated purification apparatuses.<br>
The apparatuses for this purpose are very complicated<br>
and the energy consumption is high. The purification of<br><br>
the circulated gas is effected either by catalytic<br>
combustion at temperatures of about 400°C or by means<br>
of a wet scrub using ethylene glycol (polyester) or<br>
water (Nylon 6).<br><br>
These processes have the further disadvantage that<br>
relatively large amounts of gas have to be circulated<br>
in order to achieve good uniform flow through the SSP<br>
reactor since only in this way can uniform treatment of<br>
the polymer be achieved and only in this way is there a<br>
sufficient driving difference between pellets and gas<br>
to achieve an acceptable residence time.<br>
A further disadvantage of the upright reactors is the<br>
large construction height which requires building<br>
heights of up to 50 m.<br>
A process in the rotating horizontal reactor (WO<br>
2004/018541 Al) has the further disadvantage that the<br>
mechanical design of the reactors is complicated and<br>
expensive since the product and gas have to be<br>
introduced and removed from the reactor using gastight<br>
rotating glands.<br>
It is also known that the solid-state polymerization<br>
can be carried out in batch processes using tumble<br>
dryers or cone dryers or similar apparatuses. However,<br>
the throughput here is small because of the size and<br>
residence time required. In addition, heat transfer to<br>
achieve the necessary reaction temperature is low,<br>
which increases the residence time.<br>
A further disadvantage of the batch processes is the<br>
relative nonuniformity of the product obtained.<br>
However, an advantage of the batch process, which is<br>
usually carried out under reduced pressure, is the<br>
relatively low discoloration and the relatively high<br>
brilliance of the product obtained.<br>
In the present process and reactor, the disadvantages<br>
of the previously described processes are avoided.<br>
According to the invention, the continuous solid-state<br><br>
polymerization is carried out by at least partly<br>
polymerizing and/or treating the particles in at least<br>
one reactor at a pressure below atmospheric pressure.<br>
In this way, relatively low discoloration and<br>
relatively high brilliance of the product are achieved.<br>
Carrying out the process step in a chamber under<br>
reduced pressure or a chamber containing a protective<br>
gas atmosphere allows a construction without a rotating<br>
gland.<br><br>
For the present purposes, particles are, for example,<br>
pellets, powder, coarse powder or fine pellets.<br>
The pressure is advantageously below 0.8 bar abs,<br>
preferably below 0.6 bar abs, particularly preferably<br>
below 0.3 bar abs.<br>
In a further advantageous embodiment, the<br>
polymerization is carried out in an essentially<br>
horizontal reactor. Essentially horizontal reactors can<br>
be made very long, so that very large plants can also<br>
be realized.<br>
It is advantageous for the; polymerization to be in the<br>
form of an after-polymerization following a melt<br>
polymerization. It is particularly advantageous for the<br>
particles (e.g. the pelletized material) being heated<br>
immediately to a higher temperature after a melt<br>
polymerization without further cooling and/or storage<br>
and subsequently being passed to an after-<br>
polymerization in at least one reactor.<br>
The heating of the particles (e.g. the granules) after<br>
the melt polymerization and pelletization is<br>
advantageously effected by conveying by means of a hot<br>
gas or in a fluidized bed. As an alternative or in<br>
addition, it is advantageous for the heating of the<br>
pellets after the melt polymerization and pelletization<br>
to be carried out in an agitated or unagitated fixed-<br>
bed reactor or in a vibrating conveyor.<br>
The object is achieved by an apparatus having the<br>
features of claim 11. Here, the apparatus of the<br>
invention comprises at least one reactor which serves<br>
for the at least partial polymerization and/or<br>
treatment of the particles (e.g. the pellets), with the<br>
pressure in the reactor being kept below atmospheric<br>
pressure or the reactor being kept under a protective<br><br>
gas atmosphere in a chamber.<br>
The reactor is advantageously configured as an<br>
essentially horizontal reactor.<br>
For operation below atmospheric pressure, it is<br>
advantageous for the at least one reactor to have a<br>
vacuum chamber (12A) or protective gas chamber (12A)<br>
and the at least one reactor (12) to be located in a<br>
vacuum chamber (12A) or protective gas chamber (12A)<br>
and/or the at least one reactor (12) itself to form the<br>
vacuum chamber (12A) or the protective gas chamber<br>
(12A).<br><br>
The use of vacuum or the use of a protective gas<br>
chamber allows a design without a rotating gland.<br>
In a further embodiment, the at least one reactor has a<br>
rotatable tube reactor. In such reactors, good heat<br>
transport can be brought about.<br>
It is also advantageous for the at least one reactor to<br>
have a cradle or be formed by a cradle, with the<br>
particles (e.g. the pellets) being able to be moved<br>
back and forth in the cradle. Efficient heat transport<br>
can also be brought about in this way.<br>
To convey the pellets in the at least one reactor,	the<br>
latter has means for producing vibration, with	the<br>
means for producing vibration ensuring that	the<br>
particles (e.g. the pellets) can be conveyed from	the<br>
inlet to the outlet.<br>
In a particularly advantageous embodiment, the at least<br>
one reactor is preceded by a prereactor, in particular<br>
a smaller, rotating tube reactor. In this way, the<br>
particles (e.g. the pellets) can efficiently be brought<br>
to a higher temperature.<br>
The at least one reactor is advantageously inclined in<br>
the direction of the outlet so that a natural transport<br>
direction results from gravity.<br>
To improve heat transfer, the at least one reactor has<br>
internals for mixing the particles (e.g. the pellets)<br>
and for reducing backmixing. It is also advantageous<br>
for internals to be configured as static mixers and/or<br>
movable mixers.<br>
It is advantageous for the at least one reactor to be<br>
able to be heated by means of a gaseous or liquid<br><br>
heating medium. As an alternative or in addition, it is<br>
advantageous for the at least one reactor and/or the<br>
product in the at least one reactor to be heated by<br>
means of an infrared radiator and/or ultrasound<br>
radiator and/or microwave radiator.<br><br>
In an embodiment which is simple to operate and easy to<br>
maintain, the at least one reactor which is located in<br>
the vacuum chamber does not have any rotating glands<br>
for the product, vacuum or heating media.<br>
The at least one reactor advantageously has at least<br>
one heating zone with internal and/or external heating<br>
facilities. In the case of more than two heating zones,<br>
these are advantageously operated at different or<br>
identical temperatures.<br>

In the embodiments of the process of the invention and<br>
the embodiments of the apparatus of the invention, the<br>
polymer is, after the melt-phase polymerization, cooled<br>
during pelletization as an extruded strand (extrudates)<br>
or underwater (spherical pellets) only to such an<br>
extent that it can be cut, i.e. pellets can be<br>
produced. The pellets are subsequently separated from<br>
the water in a centrifuge or a similar apparatus and<br>
immediately reheated and passed to the solid-state<br>
polymerization (SSP) . Even if pellets are used in the<br>
description of the embodiments, it is in principle also<br>
possible to use particles such as coarse powder or<br>
powder.<br>
The heating of the pellets can be carried out in a<br>
conventional crystallizer (fixed bed or fluidized bed)<br>
or by means of transport in a stream of hot gas. Here,<br>
the temperature and residence time of the apparatus for<br>
heating the pellets or the hot gas transport are set so<br>
that the pelletized material crystallizes and is dried.<br>
In the case of the preparation of polyester,<br>
crystallization is carried out to such an extent that<br>
the pellets no longer stick and enter the SSP at a<br>
temperature very close to the solid-state<br>
polymerization temperature.<br>
In the case of Nylon 6, the residence time and<br>
temperature are set so that the pellets enter the SSP<br><br>
at a temperature very close to the solid-state<br>
polymerization temperature.<br>
Before going into detail regarding the individual<br>
illustrative embodiments of the process and the<br>
apparatus, a few general remarks which essentially<br>
apply to all figures will be made beforehand.<br><br>
The polyester polymer prepared in a continuous<br>
polycondensation plant has an intrinsic viscosity which<br>
is sufficiently high, e.g. from 0.3 to 0.6 I.V., to be<br>
able to produce a uniform pelletized material in an<br>
extrusion pelletizatior. plant or underwater<br>
pelletization.<br>
In the pelletization plant, a pelletized material 20<br>
having a pellet weight of from 4 to 30 mg per pellet,<br>
advantageously from 4 to 15 mg, is produced.<br>
In a centrifuge 1 (or in a screen which is not shown in<br>
figures 1 to 4), the pelletized material 20 is freed of<br>
the cutting water and coarse material is removed in a<br>
downstream screen 2. The pelletized material 20 then<br>
falls into a hot gas transport apparatus 4 and is<br>
heated and transportec oy the hot gases.<br>
Crystallization and drying occur here. The pelletized<br>
material 20 after transport and before entry into the<br>
solid-state polymerization has a degree of<br>
crystallization of at least 25% and a temperature of at<br>
least 180°C, advantageously more than 200°C.<br>
As an alternative, immediate heating and partial<br>
crystallization are carried out in a conventional<br>
crystallizer (e.g. agitated fixed bed, vibrational<br>
conveyor or fluidized bed) . From there, it is conveyed<br>
by means of hot gas transport to the SSP reactor 12.<br>
The reactor 12 for the solid-state polymerization<br>
(after-polymerization) comprises a horizontal, slightly<br>
inclined if necessary, tube reactor (also referred to<br>
as rotary tube oven; see figures 5 and 9) or a cradle<br>
(also referred to as rocking oven; see figures 7, 8,<br>
10) .<br>
The tube reactor 12 (or the cradle configured as<br>
reactor 12) is located in a vacuum chamber (12A) and<br><br>
can thus be operated under reduced pressure (i.e. below<br>
atmospheric pressure) without complicated vacuum-tight<br>
rotating glands being required for the introduction and<br>
discharge of pelletized material 20 and heating medium.<br>
The size of the reactors is therefore not subject to<br>
any limits.<br>
In the illustrative embodiments, the reactor is shown<br>
in conjunction with a vacuum chamber 12A. However, each<br>
illustrative embodiment can also be modified by the<br>
reactor 12 being present under protective gas (e.g.<br>
nitrogen) in a chamber 12A. The examples are to be<br>
interpreted as a chamber 12A having a pressure below<br>
atmospheric pressure (vacuum chamber) or being filled<br>
with protective gas.<br><br>
The tube reactor 12 is a rotating tube and can have<br>
internals in its interior so as to set the pelletized<br>
material 20 in continual motion and prevent backmixing<br>
of feed granules and output granules.<br>
The tube reactor 12 (or the cradle configured as<br>
reactor 12) can be heated by means of heating media<br>
such as heat transfer oil or steam or similar heating<br>
media.<br>
To increase the working temperature, the tube reactor<br>
12 (or the cradle configured as reactor 12) can be<br>
preceded by a more quickly rotating heated smaller tube<br>
reactor 17 (see figures 9 and 10) ; in this case, no<br>
heating is required for the tube reactor 12 ;or the<br>
cradle configured as reactor 12).<br>
The reduced pressure and any further heating brings<br>
about the after-polymerization. The vapors and gases<br>
given off are extracted by suction by the vacuum<br>
facility, the condensable vapors are condensed and<br>
passed to wastewater treatment or recirculated to the<br>
melt-phase polymerization. The incondensable offgases<br>
are given off to the atmosphere or passed to a<br>
conventional offgas purification or incineration. These<br>
are amounts of offgas which are caused by leakages.<br>
They are therefore significantly smaller than the<br>
amount of offgas from the catalytic offgas combustion<br>
of conventional solid-state polymerizations.<br>
Operation under reduced pressure avoids damage to the<br>
pelletized material 20 by residual oxygen which is<br>
normally present in a conventional solid-state<br>
polymerization. Furthermore, as a result of the reduced<br>
pressure, the driving differential pressure/partial<br>
pressure is significantly greater than in conventional<br>
SSP, so that a more uniform product (from pellet to<br>
pellet and within the pellet itself) is achieved.<br><br>
In conventional plants, the substances emitted from the<br>
pelletized material 20 can ceposit on the pelletized<br>
material 20 before they are removed from the system by<br>
means of the nitrogen. In the process of the invention,<br>
immediate vaporization under reduced pressure occurs.<br>
In this way, deposits cannot form on the pelletized<br>
material, as a result o:: which the product attains<br>
higher brilliance.<br>
Description of the process and the apparatus as shown<br>
in fig. 1<br>
Pelletized material 20	and water come from	the<br>
pelletization apparatus. In the centrifuge 1,	the<br>
pelletized material 20 is	separated from the water.	The<br>
water goes back to the<br><br>
pelletization plant and the pelletized material 20<br>
falls onto a screen 2 on which it is separated from<br>
small and large particles. The pelletized material 20<br>
has a temperature of from 70 to 150°C (polyester!.<br>
From the screen, the pelletized material 20 goes via a<br>
transport device 3, e.g. a star feeder, to a transport<br>
apparatus 4. The transport: apparatus 4 is in this case<br>
operated by means of hot gas, e.g. nitrogen. In the<br>
transport apparatus 4, the pelletized material 20 is<br>
heated to the reaction temperature necessary for the<br>
solid-state polymerization, e.g. 200-210°C (polyester).<br>
The transport gas is circulated. The pelletized<br>
material 20 is separated from the transport gas in a<br>
cyclone 5 and falls into a collection vessel 6. The<br>
transport gas goes to a blower 7 and is recirculated by<br>
this through a filter 8 and a heating body 10 to the<br>
transport device 3. If required, a deoxo facility 9 can<br>
be used to remove undesirable oxygen from the transport<br>
gas.<br>
From the collection vessel 6, the pelletized material<br>
20 goes via a metering device 11 into the SSP reactor<br>
12 for the after-polymerization. The reactor 12<br>
operates at below atmospheric pressure (reduced<br>
pressure) which is generated by a vacuum facility 13.<br>
Various embodiments of the reactor 12 are described<br>
with the aid of figures 5 tc 10.<br>
Condensable substances which are extracted from the<br>
reactor 12 with the incondensable gases are condensed<br>
in a condensation system 14.<br>
In the SSP reactor 12, the pelletized material 20 is<br>
after-polymerized to a higher viscosity. During this<br>
after-polymerization, the pelletized material 20 is<br>
continually kept in motion by rotation of the reactor<br><br>
12. Backmixing of the pelletized material 20 is avoided<br>
by means of suitable internals in the reactor 12 (e.g.<br>
static mixers) . At the outlet of the reactor 12, the<br>
pelletized material 20 falls into a funnel and into a<br>
suitable discharge device 15.<br>
From the discharge device, the pelletized material 20<br>
goes into a pellet cooler 16 and from there to<br>
packaging or storage hoppers. Cooling of the pelletized<br>
material 20 is preferably carried out under an inert<br>
gas atmosphere.<br><br>
Description of the process and the apparatus as shown<br>
in fig. 2<br>
The basic structure of the second embodiment as shown<br>
in fig. 2 corresponds to that of the first embodiment,<br>
so that reference is made to the above description.<br>
As in the first embodiment shown in fig. 1, pelletized<br>
material 20 and water come from the pelletization<br>
apparatus. Unlike the first embodiment, the transport<br>
apparatus 4 transports the material mechanically under<br>
hot gas, e.g. nitrogen. During transport, the<br>
peiietized material 20 is heated to the reaction<br>
temperature necessary for the solid-state<br>
polymerization, e.g. 200-210°C (polyester).<br>
The recirculation of the transport gas corresponds to<br>
that of the first embodiment.<br>
From the collection vessel 6, the peiietized material<br>
20 goes via a metering device 11 into the SSP reactor<br>
12 for the after-polymerization, with the work-up of<br>
the after-polymer corresponding to the first<br>
embodiment.<br>
Description of the process and the apparatus shown in<br>
fig. 3<br>
As in the first embodiment, transport of the peiietized<br>
material in the third embodiment of the process of the<br>
invention is effected by means of hot gas, e.g.<br>
nitrogen.<br>
The transport gas is circulated.	The peiietized<br>
material 20 is separated from the gas	in the cyclone 5<br>
and falls into a pellet preheater 4A.	In the preheater<br>
4A, the peiietized material 20 is	brought to the<br>
reaction temperature necessary for	the solid-state<br><br>
polymerization, e.g. 200-210˚C (polyester). From there,<br>
the material goes into the collection vessel 6.<br>
The work-up of the circulating gas and the<br>
configuration of the reactor 12 are as in the first two<br>
embodiments.<br>
Description of the process and the apparatus shown in<br>
fig. 4<br>
Pelletized material 20 and water come from the<br>
pelletization apparatus. In the centrifuge 1, the<br>
pelletized material 20 is separated from the water. The<br>
water goes back to the pelletization plant and the<br>
granulated material 20 falls onto a screen 2 in which<br>
it is separated from small and large particles. The<br>
pelletized material has a temperature of from 70 to<br>
150°C (polyester).<br><br>
From the screen 2, the pelletized material 20 goes via<br>
a transport device 3, e.g. a star feeder, into the<br>
pellet preheater 4A which in the fourth embodiment is<br>
located upstream of the transport apparatus 4 . In the<br>
preheater 4A, the pelletized material is heated to the<br>
reaction temperature necessary for the solid-state<br>
polymerization, e.g. 200-210°C (polyester).<br>
From the preheater 4A, the pelletized material 20 goes<br>
via a transport metering device 3A into a granule<br>
transport apparatus 4. The material is conveyed, for<br>
example, by means of nitrogen.<br>
The transport gas is circulated, with the work-up of<br>
the circulating gas and the configuration of the after-<br>
polymerization corresponding to the first embodiment.<br>
Figures 5 to 10 describe various embodiments of the SSP<br>
reactor 12. These embodiments can be integrated into<br>
one of the above-described process variants.<br>
Description of the SSP reactor 12 as shown in fig. 5,<br>
5A, 5B<br>
In the first embodiment of the SSP reactor 12 for the<br>
after-polymerization, the reactor is configured as an<br>
essentially horizontal tube reactor 12.<br>
The essentially horizontal tube reactor 12 is located<br>
in a vacuum chamber 12A. As an alternative, the vacuum<br>
chamber 12A can also be configured as protective gas<br>
chamber 12A.<br>
The reactor 12 rests on rollers 12C (see sectional view<br>
in fig. 5B) which can be driven by a drive 12B and can<br>
thus set the reactor 12 into rotary motion. The drive<br>
12B can also be effected by means of a crown gear or<br>
similar devices.<br><br>
The pelletized material is conveyed from the collection<br>
vessel 6 by means of a metering device 11 into the<br>
rotating reactor 12. The pelletized material 20 moves<br>
as a result of the inclination of the reactor 12 and/or<br>
internal chicanes from the inlet to the outlet of the<br>
reactor 12. The speed of rotation of the reactor 12 can<br>
be adjusted, by means of which the residence time of<br>
the pelletized material 20 can be influenced.<br>
The output from the reactor falls as pelletized<br>
material 20 into a funnel and is discharged by means of<br>
the discharge means 15.<br><br>
Inlet and outlet for pelletized material and also	the<br>
gas extraction 12G (vacuum port) and any inlets	and<br>
outlets for heating media are connected rigidly to	the<br>
upright vacuum chamber 12A.<br>
The reactor can be equipped with a means of heating,<br>
e.g. a heating jacket or a radiant heater (e.g.<br>
microwave). In the sectional view of fig. 5A, a heating<br>
jacket 12H is shown.<br>
Description of the SSP reactor as shown in fig. 6, 6A<br>
The second embodiment as shown in fig.	6 basically<br>
corresponds to the embodiment depicted in	fig. 5, with<br>
the tube reactor 12 here being provided	with movable<br>
internals 12E with a drive 12D.<br>
As an alternative, the internals can also be configured<br>
without a drive, e.g. as static mixers.<br>
Description of the SSP reactor as shown in fig. 7, 7A,<br>
7B, 7C<br>
The reactor 12 has a cradle or is formed by the cradle<br>
which is located in a vacuum chamber 12A.<br>
The cradle is configured as a long half tube which has<br>
a cross section similar to a baby's cradle. This is<br>
moved back and forth by means of a drive, in a manner<br>
similar to a baby's cradle. The pelletized material 20<br>
is continually kept in motion by the appropriate<br>
internals and the movement of the cradle, and back-<br>
mixing of pelletized material introduced and material<br>
to be discharged is also prevented.<br>
The reactor 12 rests on rollers 12C which can be ariven<br>
by the drive 12B and set the reactor 12 into rotating<br>
motion from left to right. Sectional views of the<br><br>
reactor 12 are shown in fig. 7A-C. Fig. 7A shows the<br>
cradle 12 rotated to the left, while fig. 7C shows the<br>
cradle rotated to the right. Fig. 7B shows the middle<br>
position of the reactor 12. The pelletized material 20<br>
(shown as the dark area in fig. 7A to 7C) is moved<br>
relatively slowly.<br>
The drive can also be effected by means of a crown gear<br>
or similar devices.<br><br>
The pelletized material is conveyed from the collection<br>
vessel 6 by means of a metering device 11 into the<br>
rotating reactor. The pelletized material 20 moves as a<br>
result of the inclination of the reactor 12 and/or<br>
internal chicanes 12E from the inlet to the outlet. The<br>
number of movements of the reactor 12 can be adjusted,<br>
by means of which the residence time can be influenced.<br>
The output from the reactor falls as pellet ized<br>
material 20 into a funnel and is discharged by means of<br>
the discharge means 15.<br>
Inlet and outlet for pelletized material and also the<br>
gas extraction 12G (vacuum port) and any inlets and<br>
outlets for heating media are connected rigidly to the<br>
upright vacuum chamber 12A,<br>
The reactor 12 is, in this embodiment, equipped with<br>
radiant heating 12F which heats the pelletized material<br>
20 from above. The motion of the reactor 12 ensures<br>
uniform heating of the pelletized material.<br>
Description of the SSP reactor shown in fig. 8, 8A, 8B<br>
The design corresponds to fig. 7 but the reactor 12 has<br>
a heating jacket 12H and/or fixed or moving chicanes<br>
12E.<br>
Description of the SSP reactor shown in fig. 9<br>
The design corresponds to :he preceding figures 7 and 8<br>
(tube reactor 12) but the actual reactor 12 is preceded<br>
by a small rotary tube reactor 17 in which the<br>
pelletized material 20 can quickly and effectively be<br>
brought to a higher operating temperature. The<br>
sectional view of fig. 9A shows the pelletized material<br>
20 in the interior of the tube reactor 12. As an<br>
alternative to the rotary tube reactor 17, it is also<br><br>
possible to use a cradle.<br>
Description of the SSP reactor shown in fig. 10:<br>
The design corresponds to the embodiments depicted in<br>
the preceding fig. 8 or 9 (cradle) , but the reactor 12<br>
is preceded by a small rotary tube reactor 12 in which<br>
the pelletized material 20 can quickly and effectively<br>
be brought to a higher operating temperature.<br><br>
