				<td>METHODS FOR INCREASING THE PRODUCTION OF<br>
ETHNOL FROM MICRONIOAL FERMENTATION<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to improvements in microbial fermentation<br>
methods for the production of ethanol from a gaseous substrate containing at least<br>
one reducing gas using anaerobic (or facultative) acetogenic bacteria<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Methods for producing ethanol, among other organic acids, alcohols,<br>
hydrogen and organic acid salts, from the microbial fermentation of gaseous substrates<br>
in media containing suitable nutrients and trace minerals using certain anaerobic<br>
bacteria have been disclosed by these inventors. For example, the inventors have<br>
previously disclosed that dilute gas mixtures are introduced into a bioreactor<br>
containing one or more strains of anaerobic bacteria that utilize the waste gas<br>
components by a direct pathway to produce a desired compound. The compound is -<br>
recovered from the aqueous phase in a separate vessel or vessels, utilizing a suitable<br>
recovery method for the compound produced. Examples of recovery methods include<br>
extraction, distillation or combinations thereof, or other efficient recovery methods.<br>
The bacteria can be removed from the aqueous phase and recycled to the bioreactor to<br>
maintain high cell concentrations, thus maximizing productivity. Cell separation, if<br>
desired, is accomplished by centrifugation, membranous filtration, or other techniques.<br>
See, for example, International Patent Application No. WO98/00558, published<br>
January 8, 1998; U.S. Patent No. 5,807,722; U.S. Patent No. 5,593,886 and U.S.<br>
Patent No. 5,821,111.<br>
In addition to its major product, acetic acid, strains of the anaerobic bacterium<br>
Clostridium Ijungdahlii are able to also produce ethanol as a product in the<br>
conversion of carbon monoxide (CO), hydrogen (H2) and carbon dioxide (CO2). The<br>
production of acetic acid (CH3COOH) and ethanol (C2H5OH) from CO, CO2 and H2<br>
are shown by the following overall stoichiometric equations:<br>
4CO +2 H2O ? CH3COOH + 2CO2(1)<br>
4H2+2 CO2 ? CH3COOH + 2H2O(2)<br>
6CO +3 H2O ? C2H5OH + 4CO2(3)<br>
6H2 + 2 CO2 ? C2H5OH + 3H2O(4)<br>
Several exemplary strains of C. Ijimgdahlii include strain PETC (U.S. Patent<br>
No. 5,173,429); strain ERI2 (U.S. Patent No. 5,593,886) and strains C-01 and O-52<br>
(U.S. Patent No. 6,136,577). These strains are each deposited in the American Type<br>
Culture Collection, 10801 University Boulevard, Manassas, VA 20110-2209, under<br>
Accession Nos.: 55383 (formerly ATCCNo. 49587), 55380, 559S8, and 55989<br>
respectively. Each of the strains of C. Ijumgdahlii is an anaerobic, gram-positive<br>
bacterium with a guanine and cytosine (G+C) nucleotide content of about 22 mole%.<br>
These bacteria use a variety of substrates for growth, but not methanol or lactate.<br>
These strains differ in their CO tolerance, specific gas uptake rates and specific<br>
productivities. In the "wild" strains found in nature, very little ethanol production is<br>
noted. Strains of C. Ijimgdahlii operate ideally at 37Â°C, and typically produce an<br>
ethanol to acetyl (i.e. which refers to both free or molecular acetic acid and acetate<br>
salts) product ratio of about 1:20 (1 part ethanol per 20 parts acetyl) in the "wild"<br>
state. Ethanol concentrations are typically only 1-2 g/L. While this ability to produce<br>
ethanol is of interest, because of low ethanol productivity the "wild" bacteria cannot<br>
be used to economically produce ethanol on a commercial basis.<br>
With minor nutrient manipulation the above-mentioned C. Ijungdahlii strains<br>
have been used to produce ethanol and acetyl with a product ratio of 1.1 (equal parts<br>
ethanol and acetyl), but the ethanol concentration is less than 10 g/L, a level that<br>
results in low productivity, below 10 g/L-day. In addition culture stability is an issue,<br>
primarily due to the relatively high (8-10 g/L) concentration of acetyl (2.5-3g/L<br>
molecular acetic acid) in combination with the presence of ethanol. Furthermore, as<br>
the gas rate is increased in an effort to produce more ethanol, the culture is inhibited,<br>
first by molecular acetic acid and then by CO. As a result, the culture becomes<br>
unstable and fails to uptake gas and produce additional product. Further, early work<br>
by the inventors showed difficulty in producing more than a 2:1 ratio of ethanol to<br>
acetyl in a steady state operation. See, e.g., Klasson etal, 1990 Applied<br>
Biochemistry and Biotechnology, Proceedings of the 11th Symposium on<br>
Biotechnology for Fuels and Chemicals, 24/25: 857; Phillips et al, 1993 Applied<br>
Biochemistry and Biotechnology, Proceedings of the 14th Symposium on<br>
Biotechnology for Fuels and Chemicals, 39/40: 559, among others.<br>
A large number of documents describe the use of anaerobic bacteria, other<br>
than C- Ijungdahlii, in the fermentation of sugars that do not consume CO, CO2 and<br>
H2 to produce solvents. In an attempt to provide high yields of ethanol, a variety of<br>
parameters have been altered which include: nutrient types, microorganism, specific<br>
addition of reducing agents, pH variations, and the addition of exogenous gases. See,<br>
e.g., Rothstein et al, 1986 J. Bacteriol, 165(l):319-320; Lovitt et al, 1988 J.<br>
Bacteriol., 170(6):2809; Taherzadeh et at, 1996 Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol.,<br>
46:116.<br>
There remains a need in the art of the handling of industrial gaseous substrates,<br>
the ability to extract valuable commodities from such gases, particularly waste gases,<br>
such as H2, CO and CO2. There is a need to enhance the production of ethanol<br>
relative to the production of the other products normally generated by the<br>
fermentation of such gases by acetogenic bacteria.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In response to the need in the art, the present invention provides novel<br>
methods which are continuous, steady state methods and which result in ethanol<br>
concentrations greater than 10 g/L and acetate concentrations lower than about 8-10<br>
g/L, while continuing to permit culture growth and good culture stability.<br>
In one aspect, the invention provides a stable continuous method for<br>
producing ethanol from the anaerobic bacterial fermentation of a gaseous substrate.<br>
The method comprising the steps of culturing in a fermentation bioreactor anaerobic,<br>
acetogenic bacteria in a liquid nutrient medium and supplying to the bioreactor the<br>
gaseous substrate comprising at least one reducing gas selected from the group<br>
consisting of CO and H2. The bacteria in the bioreactor are manipulated by reducing<br>
the redox potential, or increasing the NAD(P)H TO NAD(P) ratio, in the fermentation<br>
broth after the bacteria achieves a steady state, e.g., a stable cell concentration, in the<br>
bioreactor. The free acetic acid concentration in the bioreactor is maintained at less<br>
than 5 g/L free acid. The culturing and manipulating steps cause the bacteria in the<br>
bioreactor to produce ethanol in a fermentation broth at a productivity greater than<br>
10g/L per day. Both ethanol and acetate are produced in the fermentation broth in a<br>
ratio of ethanol to acetate ranging from 1:1 to 20:1.<br>
In one embodiment of this method, the manipulating step includes one or more<br>
of the following steps: altering at least one parameter selected from the group<br>
consisting of nutrient medium contents, nutrient feed rate, aqueous feed rate,<br>
operating pressure, operating pH, gaseous substrate contents, gas feed rate,<br>
fermentation broth agitation rate, product inhibition step, cell density, and substrate<br>
inhibition.<br>
In another embodiment of this method, the manipulating step comprises<br>
supplying to said bioreactor said gaseous substrate comprising the reducing gas, CO,<br>
at a desired rate of uptake. This rate is desirably from 0.3 to 2 mmol CO/gram of dry<br>
cell of bacteria in said bioreactor/minute.<br>
In still another embodiment of this method the manipulating step comprises<br>
feeding into said fermentation bioreactor said nutrient medium comprising a limiting<br>
amount of calcium pantothenate. The calcium pantothenate is desirably in a range of<br>
from 0.5 to 50 Âµg/grams of dry cell of bacteria produced in the bioreactor.<br>
In yet anotliei aspect, the invention provides Another embodiment of the<br>
method includes supplying excess H2 reducing gas to said bioreactor prior to<br>
providing the limiting amount of calcium pantothenate.<br>
In yet a further aspect, the invention provides a method in which the<br>
manipulating step of the method includes feeding into said fermentation bioreactor<br>
said nutrient medium comprising a limiting amount of cobalt. Desirably, the amount<br>
of cobalt is in a range of from 5 to 100 Âµg cobalt/grams of dry cell of bacteria<br>
produced in said bioreactor.<br>
In another embodiment, the method of the invention includes preventing<br>
acclimation of said bacteria in said bioreactor to said amount of cobalt by maintaining<br>
a constant cobalt concentration and adjusting one or more parameters, such as gas<br>
rate, liquid rate, agitation rate and H2 gas partial pressure.<br>
Additional optional steps of these methods include subjecting a sample of the<br>
broth to centrifugation to eliminate cells and to gas chromatography to monitor the<br>
maintenance of the ratio and/or productivity values.<br>
In another embodiment, the method comprises feeding as the gaseous<br>
substrate an amount of H2 in slight excess of the stoichiometric amount for ethanol<br>
production. In still another embodiment, the gaseous substrate further comprises an<br>
amount of CO in slight excess of the amounts required by the bacteria, wherein uptake<br>
of H2 by the bacteria is inhibited and the NAD(P)H to NAD(P) ratio in the broth is<br>
increased.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the method, a step is provided in which<br>
inhibition by molecular acetic acid is reduced by increasing the aqueous feed rate<br>
when the molecular acetic acid present in the fermentation broth approaches or<br>
exceeds 2g/L.<br>
In another embodiment of the method, the manipulating step may include<br>
agitating the medium, bacteria.and gaseous substrate in the bioreactor at a selected<br>
agitation rate. For example, reduction in the agitation rate reduces the amount of CO<br>
transferred to the fermentation broth. This reduction in the rate of CO transfer causes<br>
an increase in H2 conversion, so that the reducing gas, H2, is present in the bioreactor<br>
in excess of the growth requirements of the bacteria. The gas rate may also be<br>
similarly reduced to decrease the amount of CO transferred, thereby increasing H2<br>
conversion, so that the reducing gas, H2, is present in the fermentation bioreactor in<br>
excess of the growth requirements of the bacteria.<br>
In still another embodiment of the method, the bacterial culture may initially be<br>
brought to the desired cell concentration in the bioreactor before limiting the calcium<br>
pantothenate or cobalt concentration of the nutrient medium.<br>
In another embodiment of the method of this invention, a two stage CSTR<br>
(bioreactor) is used which consists of a growth reactor which feeds the fermentation<br>
broth to a production reactor in which most of the ethanol is produced.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, the method described above includes the<br>
optional steps of: recovering ethanol by removing the fermentation broth from the<br>
bioreactor; distilling ethanol from the broth; and recovering the ethanol. Additionally<br>
or preferably, a sample of the broth is subjected to centrifugation to eliminate cells;<br>
and the maintenance of the ratio is monitored using gas chromatography.<br>
In still another aspect, the method of the invention may farther employ an<br>
additional step of recycling water (containing up to 5 g/L acetyl) from the ethanol<br>
production back to the reactor so that an equilibrium is established between the<br>
ethanol and acetyl in the reactor. As a result, more of the CO, CO2 and H2 fed to the<br>
reactor and converted to products results in ethanol production.<br>
Other aspects and advantages of the present invention are described further in<br>
the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments thereof.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE/DRAWINGS<br>
Fig. 1 is a schematic diagram illustrating a continuous fermentation method<br>
with product recovery according to this invention. Gaseous substrate 1 and liquid<br>
phase nutrient medium 2 are fed to bioreactor 3 containing the subject bacterial<br>
culture. Conversion of the gaseous substrate to ethanol and acetic acid takes place in<br>
the bioreactor 3. Exhaust gas 4 containing gases other than CO, CO, and H2 and<br>
unconverted CO, CO2 and H2 from bioreactor 3 are vented, combusted as fuel or<br>
flared. With cell recycle, liquid effluent 5 is sent to cell separator 6 where the cells 7<br>
and cell-free permeate 8 are separated. Cells 7 are sent back to bioreactor 3 and<br>
permeate 8 is sent to product recovery. Ethanol can be recovered from the permeate<br>
8 (or alternatively from the effluent 5 if cell separation is not employed). Permeate 8<br>
is separated in distillation column 9 to produce 95% ethanol overhead 10, and water<br>
11 for recycle back to bioreactor 3. The 95% ethanol overhead 10 is sent to a<br>
molecular sieve 12 where anhydrous ethanol 13, the desired final product, is separated<br>
from dilute ethanol 14 which is sent back to the distillation column 9.<br>
Fig. 2 is a schematic diagram of a two-stage, continuously stirred reactor<br>
(CSTR) system for improved culture stability. Growth stage CSTR 1 is fed liquid<br>
medium 2. Unconverted gas 3 from the Production Stage CSTR is fed to Growth<br>
Stage CSTR 1. Production Stage CSTR 4 is fed a fresh gas feed 5, and fresh medium<br>
feed 6 as well as culture feed 7 from Growth Stage CSTR 1. Cell recycle 8 is used to<br>
get the most production out of the cells 9 sent to Production Stage CSTR 4. Cells 9<br>
are not recycled to the Growth Stage CSTR. Liquid Product 10 consisting of dilute<br>
ethanol in the fermentation broth is produced as the final distillation product, and is<br>
recovered as anhydrous ethanol as in Fig. 1.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention involves methods for the anaerobic fermentation of<br>
gaseous substrates containing at least one reducing gas, particularly the gaseous<br>
components of industrial waste and synthesis gases (e.g., CO, CO2 and H2) to ethanol.<br>
These methods yield ethanol productivities greater than 10 g/L day by manipulating<br>
the biological pathways of the subject bacteria. One method of the invention causes<br>
an abundance of NAD(P)H over NAD(P). The oxidation of NAD(P)H to NAD(P)<br>
causes acetic acid produced by the culture to be reduced to ethanol. Alternatively,<br>
other methods for the production of high concentrations of ethanol in an anaerobic<br>
fermentation of this invention involve reducing the redox potential of the fermentation<br>
broth, and thereby reducing acetic acid to ethanol. The methods of this invention<br>
produce high ethanol concentrations (i.e., greater than about 10 g/L, and preferably<br>
greater than about 15 g/L) and low acetate concentrations (i.e. less than about 5 g/L<br>
free acetic acid in the bioreactor). These methods also maintain and control method<br>
conditions for continuous ethanol and acetic acid production to help the system<br>
recover rapidly from method upsets. Further, the methods of this invention help<br>
prevent culture acclimation to low nutrient concentration, which can be detrimental to<br>
culture performance. The present invention provides a viable commercial method for<br>
ethanol production.<br>
I. Definitions<br>
Unless otherwise defined, the following terms as used throughout this<br>
specification are defined as follows.<br>
The term "continuous method" as used herein refers to a fermentation method<br>
which includes continuous nutrient feed, substrale feed, cell production in the<br>
bioreactor, cell removal (or purge) from the bioreactor, and product removal. This<br>
continuous feeds, removals or cell production may occur in the same or in different<br>
streams. A continuous process results in the achievement of a steady state within the<br>
bioreactor. By "steady state" is meant that all of these measurable variables (i.e., feed<br>
rates, substrate and nutrient concentrations maintained in the bioreactor, cell<br>
concentration in the bioreactor and cell removal from the bioreactor, product removal<br>
from the bioreactor, as well as conditional variables such as temperatures and<br>
pressures) are constant over time.<br>
The term "gaseous substrates" as used herein means CO alone, CO and H2,<br>
CO2 and H2, or CO, CO2 and H2, optionally mixed with other elements or compounds,<br>
including nitrogen and methane in a gaseous state. Such gaseous substrates include<br>
gases or streams, which are typically released or exhausted to the atmosphere either<br>
directly or through combustion. In some embodiments of this method the gaseous<br>
substrate comprises CO. In other embodiments of this method, the gaseous substrate<br>
comprises CO2 and H2. In still other embodiments, the gaseous substrate comprises<br>
CO and H2. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the gaseous substrate comprises<br>
CO, CO2 and H2. Still other substrates of the invention may include those<br>
components mentioned above and at least one gas of nitrogen, CO2, ethane and<br>
methane. Thus, such substrates include what is conventionally referred to as "syngas"<br>
or synthesis gas from the gasification of carbon products (including methane), as well<br>
as waste gases from a variety of industrial methods.<br>
The term "reducing gas" means either or both CO or H2. By the phrase "an<br>
amount of reducing gas greater than that required for growth of the bacteria" is mean<br>
that amount of reducing gas that exceeds the amount that the bacteria can use for<br>
growth or metabolism, given the nutrient medium ingredients. This amount can be<br>
achieved by increasing the net amount of reducing gas, or by reducing key nutrient<br>
ingredients, so that the excess amount of gas is achieved without increasing the gas,<br>
or by increasing the rate of gas delivery to the bacteria. When the bacteria are<br>
exposed to more reducing gas than required for growth, the bacteria respond by<br>
increasing the producing of ethanol.<br>
"Subject bacteria" are acetogenic anaerobic (or facultative) bacteria, which are<br>
able to convert CO and water or H2 and CO, into ethanol and acetic acid products.<br>
Useful bacteria according to this invention include, without limitation, Acetogenium<br>
kivai, Acetobacterium woodii, Acetoanaerobium noterae, Clostridium aceticum,<br>
Butyribacterium methylotrophicum, C. acetobutylicum, C. thermoaceticun,<br>
Eubacterium limosum, C. Ijungdahlii PETC, C Ijiungdahlii ERI2, C. ljungdahlii C-<br>
01, C. Ijimgdahlii O-52, and Peptostreptococcus productus. Other acetogenic<br>
anaerobic bacteria are selected for use in these methods by one of skill in the art.<br>
By the term "mixed strains," it is meant a mixed culture of two or more of the<br>
subject bacteria. Such "mixed strains" of the bacteria enumerated hereinabove are<br>
utilized in the methods of this invention.<br>
The terms "bioreactor," "reactor," or "fermentation bioreactor," include a<br>
fermentation device consisting of one or more vessels and/or towers or piping<br>
arrangement, which includes the Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR),<br>
Immobilized Cell Reactor (ICR), Trickle Bed Reactor (TBR), Bubble Column, Gas<br>
lift Fermenter, Static Mixer, or other device suitable for gas-liquid contact. Preferably<br>
for the method of this invention, the fermentation bioreactor comprises a growth<br>
reactor which feeds the fermentation broth to a second fermentation bioreactor, in<br>
which most of the product, ethanol, is produced.<br>
"Nutrient medium" is used generally to describe conventional bacterial growth<br>
media which contain vitamins and minerals sufficient to permit growth of a selected<br>
subject bacteria. Sugars are not included in these media. Components of a variety of<br>
nutrient media suitable to the use of this invention are known and reported in prior<br>
publications, including those of the inventors. See, e.g. the nutrient media formulae<br>
described in International Patent Application No. WO98/00558; U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,807,722; U.S. Patent No. 5,593,886, and U.S. Patent No. 5,821,111, as well as in<br>
the publications identified above. According to the present invention, a typical<br>
laboratory nutrient medium for acetate production from CO, CO2, and H2 contains 0.9<br>
mg/L calcium pantothenate. However, a typical laboratory nutrient medium for<br>
ethanol production from CO, CO2, and H2 contains 0.02 mg/L calcium pantothenate.<br>
The terms "limiting substrate" or "limiting nutrient" define a substance in the<br>
nutrient medium or gaseous substrate which, during bacterial culture growth in the<br>
bioreactor, is depleted by the culture to a level which no longer supports steady state<br>
or stable bacterial growth in the bioreactor. All other substances in the nutrient<br>
medium or gas substrate are thus present in excess, and are "non-limiting". The<br>
evidence for limitation is that an increase in the rate of addition of the limiting<br>
substrate, i.e. in the nutrient feed rate or gas feed rate, to the culture causes a<br>
corresponding increase in the rate of gas uptake (mmol/min of gas) due to increase in<br>
cell density.<br>
Unless stated otherwise, the term "acetate" is used to describe the mixture of<br>
molecular or free acetic acid and acetate salt present in the fermentation broth. The<br>
ratio of molecular acetic acid to acetate is dependent upon the pH of the system, i.e.,<br>
at a constant "acetate" concentration, the lower the pH, the higher the molecular<br>
acetic acid concentration relative to acetate salt.<br>
"Cell concentration" in this specification is based on dry weight of bacteria<br>
per liter of sample. Cell concentration is measured directly or by calibration to a<br>
correlation with optical density.<br>
The term "natural state" describes any compound, element, or pathway having<br>
no additional electrons or protons that are normally present. Conversely, the term<br>
"reduction state" describes any compound, element, or pathway having an excess of<br>
one or more electrons. The "reduction state" is achieved by adding one or more<br>
electrons to the "natural state", i.e. by lowering the redox potential of the<br>
fermentation broth.<br>
"Ethanol productivity" is the volumetric productivity of ethanol, calculated as<br>
the ratio of the steady state ethanol concentration and the liquid retention time (LRT)<br>
in continuous systems, or the ratio of the ethanol concentration and the time required<br>
to produce that concentration in batch systems. The phrase "high ethanol<br>
productivity" describes a volumetric ethanol productivity of greater than 10 g/Lâ¢day.<br>
The phrase "high concentration of ethanol" means greater than about 10 g/L,<br>
preferably greater than 15 g/L ethanol in fermentation broth or a product ratio of<br>
ethanol to acetate of 5:1 or more.<br>
"Excess H2" is available for ethanol production when the ratio of the moles of<br>
H2 in the feed gas to the sum of two times the moles of CO converted and three times<br>
the moles of CO2 converted is greater than 1.0. If this ratio is less than 1.0, excess H2<br>
is not available and ethanol can only be produced through a different controlling<br>
mechanism.<br>
II. The Biological Pathways Utilized in the Method of this Invention<br>
Without wishing to be bound by theory, the inventors theorize that the<br>
methods for increasing the anaerobic production of ethanol from the methods<br>
described herein are based upon the biological pathways involving the conversion of<br>
NAD(P)H to NAD(P) in the basic pathway cycles of the acetogenic pathway for<br>
autotrophic growth. The invention involves manipulating those pathways to enable<br>
continuous production and maintenance of high concentrations of ethanol with low<br>
acetate concentrations under stable operating conditions, thereby providing<br>
commercially useful methods for ethanol production from industrial gases.<br>
The essential involvement of NAD(P)H to NAD(P) in the biological pathways<br>
is described as follows: The production of ethanol from gaseous components, such as<br>
CO, CO2, and H2 occurs in a three step biological method. In the first step, the<br>
substrates CO and H2 are oxidized and, in doing so, release NAD(P)H:<br>
NAD(P)? NAD(P)H<br>
CO + H2 + H2O? CO2 + 4H+<br>
The products of step 1 are then converted to acetic acid, a step that requires<br>
NAD(P)H:<br>
NAD(P)H? NAD(P)<br>
CO + CO2 + 6 H+ ? CH3COOH + H2O<br>
Finally, if excess NAD(P)H is available because the reaction of step 1 proceeds at a<br>
faster rate than the reaction of step 2, acetic acid is reduced to ethanol.<br>
NAD(P)H? NAD(P)<br>
CH3COOH + 4H+ ? C2H5OH + H2O<br>
Thus, the availability of excess NAD(P)H from substrate oxidation leads to the<br>
production of ethanol from acetic acid.<br>
There are two known basic pathway cycles in the acetogenic pathway: (1) the<br>
Acetyl-CoA cycle and (2) the THF cycle, in which CO, is reduced to a methyl group.<br>
The sequence for the generation of ethanol and acetic acid therefrom is illustrated in J.<br>
R. Phillips et al., 1994 Applied Biochemistry and Biotechnology, 45/46:145. The<br>
Acetyl-CoA cycle has an inner cycle, referred to herein as the CO cycle. As the CO<br>
cycle normally reacts clockwise, ferredoxin is reduced. Ferredoxin can also be<br>
reduced by H2 as it is oxidized on the enzyme hydrogenase. As a result, the Acetyl-<br>
CoA cycle also reacts clockwise, and ferredoxin is oxidized. If the inner CO cycle and<br>
the Acetyl-CoA cycle react at the same rates, ferredoxin is in a redox-state<br>
equilibrium. If however, these two cycles do not occur at the same rate, i.e., the CO<br>
cycle reacts at a faster rate than the Acetyl-CoA cycle, reduced ferredoxin is built up.<br>
Also with excess H2, reduced ferredoxin can also be produced in excess. This excess<br>
reduced ferredoxin causes the NAD(P) to be regenerated (reduced) to NAD(P)H,<br>
which builds an excess that must be relieved to equilibrium and in doing so, reduces<br>
acetic acid to ethanol.<br>
The THF cycle functions for cell growth and is necessary for a continuous<br>
culture; therefore it cannot be completely stopped. Reducing the THF cycle rate also<br>
serves to cause a higher NAD(P)H to NAD(P) ratio. NAD(P)H is oxidized in two<br>
places. By limiting this oxidation, which would keep the total cellular NAD(P)H to<br>
NAD(P) ratio in balance, the NAD(P)H is used to reduce acetic acid to ethanol<br>
A second basic method of causing acetic acid to be reduced to ethanol is by<br>
directly lowering the redox potential of the fermentation broth. A reduction state<br>
sufficiently lower than the natural state of the culture causes NAD(P)H to be in<br>
abundance and promote the reduction of acetic acid to ethanol.<br>
III. The Methods of the Invention<br>
The basic steps of the method include the following: A continuous<br>
fermentation method with product recovery is described by reference to Fig. 1 and<br>
exemplified in Example 1 below. A continuous flow of gaseous substrate 1<br>
comprising at least one reducing gas, e.g., CO or H2, is supplied at a selected gas feec<br>
rate and a continuous flow of liquid phase nutrient medium 2 at a selected nutrient<br>
feed rate are supplied to a fermentation bioreactor 3 containing a subject bacteria. In<br>
the bioreactor 3, the medium and gaseous substrate are fermented by the bacteria to<br>
produce ethanol and acetate acid. Once a stable cell concentration is achieved under<br>
steady state conditions, the components of the continuous system are manipulated to<br>
reduce the redox potential, or increase the NAD(P)H to NAD(P) ratio, in the<br>
fermentation broth, while keeping the free acetic acid concentration in the bioreactor<br>
less than 5g/L. The methods of this invention are designed to permit and maintain<br>
production of ethanol and acetate in the fermentation broth such that the ethanol<br>
productivity is greater than 10 g/Lâ¢day at an ethanol to acetate ratio of between 1:1<br>
and 20:1. In one embodiment, that ratio is greater than 3:1. In another embodiment,<br>
that ratio is greater than 5:1. In still another embodiment, that ratio is greater than<br>
10:1. In still another embodiment that ratio is greater than 15:1. The method of this<br>
invention is alternatively effective in enhancing stable continuous (steady state)<br>
production of high ethanol concentrations (15-35 g/L ethanol) and low acetate<br>
concentrations (0-5 g/L acetate), i.e., ethanol to acetate product ratio of 3:1 or more,<br>
from CO, CO2, and H2 with good method stability.<br>
Periodically, during the course of the methods of this invention, samples of th<br>
broth are removed to determine the ratio by a conventional assay method. For<br>
example, the cells are separated from the sample, e.g., by centrifugation and the cell-<br>
free sample is then subject to an assay method, such as the preferred method of gas<br>
chromatography. However, other conventional assay methods are selected by one of<br>
skill in the art. The additional optional steps of the method are added to achieve<br>
and/or maintain the ratio. Example 2 demonstrates such an assay method.<br>
Steps used to manipulate the system components and maintain and/or achieve<br>
the desired ethanol productivity or the ethanol to acetate ratio include at least one,<br>
and desirably, combinations of the following steps: altering nutrient medium contents,<br>
nutrient feed rate, aqueous feed rate, operating pressure, operating pH, gaseous<br>
substrate contents, gas feed rate, fermentation broth agitation rate, avoiding product<br>
inhibition step, decreasing cell density in the bioreactor, or preventing substrate<br>
inhibition. Some preferred manipulations include supplying the bioreactor with liquid<br>
phase nutrient (pantothenate or cobalt) limitation, a slight excess of CO and H2 in the<br>
feed gas, minimizing acetate concentration, avoiding culture acclimation to low liquid<br>
phase nutrient concentrations, bringing the culture to a suitable cell concentration at a<br>
relatively fast rate, raising the pH of the culture above 4.5, purging bacterial cells from<br>
the bioreactor to a cell concentration less than the stable steady state concentration<br>
that utilizes all reducing gas or nutrient substrates in the bioreactor and increasing the<br>
aqueous feed rate when the free acetic acid portion of the acetate present in the<br>
fermentation bioreactor broth exceeds 2g/L, thereby inhibiting any unwanted increase<br>
in the concentration of free acetic acid. All of these steps are described in detail<br>
below.<br>
Exhaust gas 4 containing gases other than CO, CO2 and H2 and unconverted<br>
CO, CO2 and H2 from the reactor are vented from the reactor and are used for their<br>
fuel value. If excess H2 as a controlling mechanism is employed, the H2 partial<br>
pressure in the outlet gas and ratio of H2 partial pressure to CO2 partial pressure in the<br>
exit gas are used to identify the control of the ethanol to acetate ratio by that step.<br>
Cell recycle is used (but is not required) to increase the concentration of cells inside<br>
the bioreactor, and thus provide more biocatalyst for CO, CO2 and H2 conversion.<br>
With cell recycle, liquid effluent from the reactor 5 is sent to a cell separator 6 where<br>
the cells 7 and permeate (cell free liquid) 8 are separated. The cells 7 are sent back to<br>
the bioreactor and the permeate 8 is sent to product recovery.<br>
Cell separation is accomplished by using a continuous centrifuge, hollow fiber<br>
or spiral wound filtration system, ceramic filter system or other solid/liquid separator.<br>
Ethanol can be recovered from the permeate (or alternatively the effluent from the<br>
reactor 5 if cell separation is not employed) by a variety of techniques including<br>
distillation and adsorption. Permeate 8 is separated in a distillation column to produce<br>
95% ethanol overhead 10, and water 11 for recycle back to the reactor 3. The recycle<br>
water 11 contains excess nutrients not used in the fermentation, but any excess<br>
vitamins from fermentation or cell lysis are destroyed by thermal distillation. The 95%<br>
ethanol overhead 10 is sent to a molecular sieve 12 where anhydrous ethanol 13, the<br>
desired final product, is separated from dilute ethanol 14 which is sent back to the<br>
distillation column 9.<br>
The continuous combination of growth, death and cell purge maintains a<br>
constant cell concentration, such that a continuous method used in producing ethanol<br>
(and small amounts of acetic acid) can operate for many months by being fed CO, CO2<br>
and H, along with nutrients without additional culture supplementation. The methods<br>
of this invention maintain and control conditions for continuous ethanol and acetic<br>
acid production and prevent or correct rapidly for method upsets. The methods of<br>
this invention also help prevent culture acclimation to low nutrient concentration,<br>
which can be detrimental to culture performance. In the descriptions below and in the<br>
examples, unless otherwise indicated, the pressure used is 1 atmosphere and the<br>
temperature used is between 36-41Â°C. Desirable temperatures and pressures may be<br>
determined by one of skill in the art, depending on the microorganism selected for use<br>
in the bioreactor.<br>
A variety of manipulations, described specifically below, added to the basic<br>
steps of this invention permit the enhanced production of ethanol. Preferably, liquid<br>
phase nutrient limitation (pantothenate or cobalt) or the use of excess H2 or CO are<br>
the method steps of the invention, described in detail below, used to achieve and<br>
maintain the desired ethanol productivity and permit production of stable<br>
concentrations and ratios of ethanol to acetate in the fermentation broth. These<br>
conditions permit production of stable concentrations of ethanol and acetate in the<br>
fermentation broth. In a preferred embodiment, the ethanol to acetate product ratio<br>
produced in the fermentation broth is greater than 10:1 and the ethanol concentration<br>
is greater than 15 g/L.<br>
A. Calcium Pantothenate Limitation<br>
In one specific embodiment of this invention, the method for manipulating the<br>
biological pathways to favor ethanol production and limit acetic acid production<br>
involves limiting the amount of calcium pantothenate in the nutrient medium to an<br>
amount which is less than required to maintain the bacteria at a stable, steady state<br>
concentration that would fully utilize the calcium pantothenate provided.<br>
Pantothenate is a component of Acetyl-CoA and therefore, by limiting calcium<br>
pantothenate in the nutrient medium, the Acetyl-CoA cycle rate is reduced relative to<br>
the CO cycle rate. This causes a build-up of reduced ferredoxin and the reduction of<br>
NAD(P) to NAD(P)H, and thereby increases the production of ethanol as the final<br>
product.<br>
Pantothenate limitation is observed when the micrograms (g) of calcium<br>
pantothenate fed to the reactor per gram (g) of cells (dry weight) produced in the<br>
reactor is in the range of 0.5 to 100. A more desirable pantothenate limitation is in the<br>
range of 2 to 75 Âµg of calcium pantothenate per gram (g) of dry cells produced in the<br>
reactor. Still a preferred pantothenate limitation is in the range of 0.5 to 50 Âµg of<br>
calcium pantothenate per gram (g) of cells produced in the reactor. Another<br>
embodiment of this limitation is at about 1-25 Âµg of calcium pantothenate per gram<br>
(g) of cells produced in the reactor. Another embodiment of this limitation is at about<br>
10-30 Âµg of calcium pantothenate per gram (g) of cells produced in the reactor. This<br>
amount of the nutrient maintains ethanol production in preference to acetate<br>
production. One embodiment of this method is illustrated in Example 4.<br>
In another aspect of this method, the acclimation of the bacteria in the<br>
fermentation bioreactor to low limiting calcium pantothenate concentration is avoided<br>
by regulating or adjusting the fermentation parameters, so that a constant calcium<br>
pantothenate concentration is maintained, while at least one, and sometimes more than<br>
one, parameter of gas feed rate, liquid feed rate, agitation rate, or H2 partial pressure<br>
is adjusted. Major changes in nutrients are avoided, but a relatively constant nutrient<br>
feed concentration is maintained. If the culture is allowed to acclimate to low liquid<br>
phase limiting nutrients, poor product ratios of 1.0 g ethanol/g acetate or less occurs<br>
in an irreversible method. Thus, reactor shut down and reinoculation is necessary.<br>
Preferably, the biological pathway is controlled to favor ethanol production and limit<br>
acetic acid production by first supplying excess H2 in the feed gas to the bioreactor,<br>
and then limiting calcium pantothenate in the nutrient medium as described above.<br>
In fact, at start-up, the normally limiting liquid phase nutrient calcium<br>
pantothenate is kept in excess to avoid acclimation to low nutrient concentrations, a<br>
condition that can result in very poor performance and the loss of the culture"s ability<br>
to produce achieve high ethanol productivities of more than 10 g/Lâ¢day if excess H2 is<br>
not employed. An example of such regulation of fermentation parameters for a<br>
particular bacterial culture is illustrated in Example 17.<br>
B. Cobalt Limitation<br>
In another embodiment of this invention, the method for manipulating the<br>
biological pathways to favor ethanol production and limit acetic acid production<br>
involves limiting the amount of cobalt in the nutrient medium to an amount which is<br>
less than required to maintain the bacteria at a stable steady state concentration that<br>
would fully utilize the cobalt provided. Cobalt limitation is observed when the<br>
micrograms (Âµg) of cobalt fed to the reactor per gram (g) of cells (dry weight)<br>
produced in the bioreactor is in the range of 5 to 100. Preferably, a cobalt limitation<br>
involves providing between about 20 to 50 Âµg of cobalt to the reactor per gram of<br>
cells produced in the reactor. This amount of cobalt maintains ethanol production in<br>
preference to acetate in the process. Example 15 illustrates an embodiment of the<br>
method of limiting cobalt to the reactor according to this method.<br>
Limiting cobalt in the fermentation broth may also reduce the Acetyl-CoA<br>
cycle rate. Because cobalt is used to transfer a methyl group from the THF cycle to<br>
the Acetyl-CoA cycle, limiting the amount of cobalt in the fermentation broth also<br>
reduces the THF cycle function by not permitting the transfer. Cobalt limitation<br>
reduces the THF cycle rate, which also causes a higher NAD(P)H to NAD(P) ratio,<br>
thereby producing ethanol.<br>
The method is further manipulated by preventing acclimation to low limiting<br>
cobalt concentration. In much the same manner as acclimation to low pantothenate<br>
concentrations is avoided, a constant cobalt concentration is maintained while<br>
adjusting one or more of the fermentation parameters (gas rate, liquid rate, agitation<br>
rate, CO2 content, and H2 gas partial pressure). Major changes in nutrients is avoided,<br>
but instead a relatively constant nutrient feed concentration is maintained. An<br>
example of such regulation of fermentation parameters for a particular bacterial<br>
culture is illustrated in Example 19.<br>
Preferably, the biological pathway is controlled to favor ethanol production<br>
and limit acetic acid production by first feeding excess H2 to the reactor and then<br>
limiting cobalt in the nutrient medium as described above. At start-up, the limiting<br>
liquid phase nutrient cobalt is kept in excess to avoid acclimation to low nutrients<br>
concentration, a condition that can result in very poor culture performance and the<br>
loss of the culture"s ability to produce product ratios greater than 1:1.<br>
C. Oversupplving Hydrogen<br>
In still another embodiment, the method for manipulating the biological<br>
pathways to favor ethanol production and limit acetic acid production involves feeding<br>
excess H2 in the feed gas or limiting gaseous carbon which results in excess H2, which<br>
is then used by the biological pathway. Preferably, the H2 reducing gas is in excess<br>
relative to CO, and the excess H2 causes the bacteria to produce a high ethanol to<br>
acetate ratio in the fermentation broth. If the ratio of the H2 (moles of gas fed) to the<br>
sum of two times the CO ( in moles of gas) converted and three times the CO, (in<br>
moles of gas) converted is greater than 1, the fermenter is carbon limited. The H2<br>
partial present in the exit gas is preferably greater than 0.4 atm. Finally the ratio of H2<br>
partial pressure to CO2 partial pressure must be greater than 3.0 to assure that<br>
sufficient H2 is available to use all the CO2. If the CO, partial pressure is greater than<br>
0.1 atm, it is likely that growth has been otherwise limited. See, Example 20 for an<br>
illustration of this method step.<br>
During start-up, the use of excess H2 is favored over nutrient limitation, mainly<br>
because it is easier to control. The benefits of employing excess H2 are that it avoids<br>
excess acetic acid production, which can lead to poor product ratios and potential<br>
acetic acid inhibition, as well as acclimation to low nutrient concentrations.<br>
D. Oversupplying Carbon Monoxide<br>
Another way of manipulating the components of the method involves<br>
oversupplying the reducing gas, CO, in the gaseous substrate for use in the pathway,<br>
which serves to directly lower the redox potential in the fermentation broth. Thus,<br>
according to this embodiment, the bioreactor is suppled with gaseous substrate<br>
comprising CO where the amount of CO present in the bioreactor is greater than the<br>
amount required to maintain the bacteria at a stable, steady state concentration that<br>
would fully utilized the CO provided. CO oversupply as a method of favoring ethanol<br>
production over acetic acid production when the specific rate of CO uptake<br>
(millimoles of CO per gram of cells (dry weight) in the reactor per minute, or mmol/g<br>
cell"min) is greater than 0.3. More preferably, this step involves a specific rate of CO<br>
uptake of greater than 0.5. This means that each cell on the average is utilizing CO in<br>
its metabolism at a rate of at least 0.3 mmol/gâ¢min., or more ideally at a rate of at least<br>
0.5 mmol/gâ¢min. Preferably, the CO is provided at a rate at which the CO uptake is<br>
from 0.3 to 2 mmol CO/gram cell (dry weight) of bacteria/minute. In another<br>
embodiment, the CO is provided at a rate of from 0.5 to 1.5 mmol CO/gram cell (dry<br>
weight) of bacteria/minute. In another embodiment, the CO is provided at a rate of<br>
about 1 mmol CO/gram cell (dry weight) of bacteria/minute. Example 24 provides an<br>
illustration of one embodiment of this method step.<br>
This rate of CO uptake maintains ethanol production in preference to acetate<br>
production. If CO is supplied such that the dissolved CO in the fermentation broth is<br>
significant by gas pressure or extremely good mass transfer, the fermentation broth<br>
becomes more reduced. Oversupply of CO has two additional benefits. Excess CO<br>
may cause the CO cycle to operate at a faster rate, and if the Acetyl-CoA. cycle is<br>
otherwise limited and cannot keep up with the CO cycle, reduced ferredoxin builds-<br>
up. CO may also slow down step 2 (production of the intermediate acetic acid) in the<br>
overall three-step method through substrate inhibition. This decreased rate of step 2<br>
in relation to step 1 causes an excess of NAD(P)H, which leads to ethanol production<br>
in favor of acetic acid.<br>
Although excess CO can result in increased ethanol production by directly<br>
reducing the redox potential of the fermentation broth, the presence of excess CO also<br>
inhibits growth by inhibiting the CO-dehydrogenase and therefore the uptake of H2.<br>
The presence of excess CO unfortunately also results in poor H2 conversion, which<br>
may not be economically favorable. The consequence of extended operation under<br>
substrate inhibition is poor H2 uptake. This eventually causes cell lysis and necessary<br>
restarting of the reactor. Where this method has an unintended result of CO substrate<br>
inhibition (the presence of too much CO for the available cells) during the initial<br>
growth of the culture or thereafter, the gas feed rate and/or agitation rate is reduced<br>
until the substrate inhibition is relieved. An illustration of how to adjust the gas rate<br>
or agitation rate to accomplish this effect is illustrated in Example 21.<br>
E Additional Manipulating Steps<br>
In addition to the major method enhancing steps described above, several<br>
method steps are desirably included in the ethanol production method.<br>
J. Increasing Mass Transfer<br>
One such additional embodiment involves ensuring that the mass<br>
transfer of the CO or H2 from the gas feed to the liquid fermentation broth is faster<br>
than the ability of the bacteria to utilize the dissolved gases. For example, if a<br>
bioreactor containing C. Ijungdahlii is fed CO, CO2 and H2 and is operated without<br>
limitation on nutrients (such as pantothenate or cobalt) or the presence of excess H2,<br>
cell growth is limited by the amount of gas transferred into the liquid phase and the<br>
system produces acetic acid as the product. If the culture is fed a slight amount of CO<br>
or H2 in excess of that required for culture growth, it produces ethanol. However, if<br>
too much gas is transferred into the liquid phase for the culture to use, substrate<br>
inhibition occurs, which can lead to culture upset and cell death. Thus, there is a very<br>
narrow range of operation with excess mass transfer. Example 22 provides an<br>
illustration of this method.<br>
With reference to the Acetyl-CoA cycle, in order for the excess<br>
reduced ferredoxin to be produced, the CO cycle or the reduction of ferredoxin<br>
through hydrogenase must occur faster than the Acetyl-CoA cycle. The methods<br>
described herein limit the rate at which the organisms can utilize the dissolved gases<br>
by restricting the rate at which essential nutrients, e.g., calcium pantothenate or cobalt,<br>
or other substrates, such as CO, gas, are available to the bacteria, or by providing<br>
excess substrate, H2 or CO to the culture.<br>
A theoretical rate of mass transfer, which is faster than the rate at<br>
which the bacteria can use substrate, even without other limitations, can be calculated.<br>
That rate, when achieved, is limited by the natural growth rate of the organism.<br>
Therefore, the most productive embodiment is where the mass transfer (gas flow rate<br>
or agitation rate) is faster than the rate at which the highest possible concentration of<br>
cells can utilize the substrate without any limitation. There would be a very narrow<br>
operating range since substrate inhibition could quickly cause cell death and a<br>
resulting by-product concentration which is toxic to the culture.<br>
2. Supplying excess CO and H2<br>
In another embodiment of a method of this invention, stability in the<br>
high ethanol concentration/limited acetic acid production is achieved in the methods<br>
which limit cobalt or calcium pantothenate, or provide an abundance of H2 or CO.<br>
According to this step, as the culture uses the gaseous substrates CO, H2 and CO2 as<br>
the carbon and energy sources, CO and H2 are supplied in slight excess. A slight<br>
excess of CO and H2 is achieved by attaining steady operation and then gradually<br>
increasing the gas feed rate and/or agitation rate (10% or less increments) until the<br>
CO and H2 conversions just start to decline. This is one means of avoiding mass<br>
transfer limitation, which favors acetic acid production, and supplying excess reduced<br>
ferredoxin in order to reduce NAD(P) to NAD(P)H and produce ethanol. If CO and<br>
H2 are not supplied in slight excess, mass transfer limitation occurs, and the pathway<br>
is balanced. This results in poor ethanol to acetate product ratios (high acetate<br>
concentrations). High acetate concentrations can ultimately result in acetic acid<br>
inhibition, which limits the ability of the bacterium to take up H2 and can eventually<br>
lead to culture failure.<br>
Steps to avoid mass transfer limitation include an increase in the<br>
agitation rate or gas rate to transfer more CO and H2 into the liquid phase, and thus<br>
return to the presence of a slight excess CO and H2. If product inhibition occurs as a<br>
result of mass transfer limitation, it is necessary to increase the liquid feed rate to clear<br>
the acetic acid inhibition, by diluting to a lower resulting acetate concentration. Since<br>
increasing the medium feed rate would increase the Âµg pantothenate or cobalt/g-cell<br>
produced, this must be done only briefly or the excess pantothenate or cobalt must be<br>
eliminated by adjusting the medium concentration or increasing the water feed rate.<br>
3. Controlling acetic acid product inhibition<br>
Where in the methods described above, acetic acid product inhibition<br>
can occur if too much molecular acetic acid, i.e., &gt;2 g/L, accumulates in the<br>
bioreactor to allow cell growth and further ethanol production. Another manipulating<br>
step is used to avoid culture failure. One modification involves briefly increasing the<br>
liquid or aqueous feed rate to reduce the liquid phase concentration of inhibiting acetic<br>
acid to lower than 2 g/L. An illustration of this step for a particular culture in a<br>
reactor is demonstrated in Example 23.<br>
4. Water recycle step<br>
Still another optional method step for maintaining a stable culture<br>
which produces ethanol as the only product with no net acetic acid production in the<br>
methods of this invention involves adding water recycle from distillation back to the<br>
fermentation reactor (see, e.g., Example 15). As was noted earlier, water (contair ng<br>
up to 5 g/L acetate) recycle has the benefit of recycling the produced acetate back to<br>
the reactor so that no net acetic acid is produced. An equilibrium is thus established<br>
between the ethanol and acetate in the reactor. As a result, all CO, CO2 and H2 fed tc<br>
the reactor and converted to products results in ethanol production, except for that<br>
used for culture maintenance.<br>
5. Reducing Cell Density<br>
Still another manipulating step useful in the method is to initiate<br>
periodic or continuous purging of bacterial cells from the bioreactor to reduce the cell<br>
concentration in the bioreactor. This manipulation serves to reduce the cell<br>
concentration to less than a stable, steady state cell concentration that utilizes all<br>
reducing gas or nutrient substrates in the bioreactor. By thus, altering the cell density,<br>
the production of ethanol is favored over the production of acetate in the bioreactor.<br>
See, e.g., Example 25.<br>
6. Two Stage CSTR<br>
One of the problems associated with ethanol production with medium<br>
limitation is the ability or tendency of the culture to eventually adapt to the limiting<br>
conditions and not continue to produce ethanol after several months of operation.<br>
Instead acetate iscome eventually the dominant product. This acclimation to low<br>
limiting nutrient concentrations results in a culture which produces more acetic acid<br>
than ethanol (ethanol to acetate product ratio of 1.0 or less), and yields low ethanol<br>
concentrations (sometimes as low as 1 g/L). Adaptation most likely occurs when the<br>
culture is not provided with sufficient nutrients during start-up, where growth rate is<br>
more important than ethanol production rate. Additionally, there is a danger that the<br>
culture can be acclimated to low limiting nutrient concentrations during steady state<br>
operation particularly as the limiting nutrient concentrations are adjusted downward to<br>
rid the reaction system of acetate.<br>
To avoid this adaptation when using the pantothenate or cobalt limiting<br>
steps above, instead of allowing the culture to grow with the available nutrients, and<br>
the danger mentioned above, another modification of the method can be employed. A<br>
two-stage CSTR system where primarily good culture growth occurs in the first stage<br>
on a slight excess of limiting nutrients (perhaps with accompanying acetic acid<br>
production), followed by a production stage where the culture from the first stage is<br>
now limited by the limiting nutrient and is used to produce high concentrations of<br>
ethanol, is another modification of the method. This modification enables the<br>
maintenance of a stable culture, which does not acclimate to reduced pantothenate or<br>
cobalt concentrations. This modification involves operating a two-stage CSTR, in<br>
which a growth reactor (Stage 1) to feed a production reactor (Stage 2) where the<br>
bulk of the ethanol production occurs. The growth reactor is not operated with the<br>
nutrient limitation steps described above, so the culture is not as susceptible to<br>
acclimation to a limited condition.<br>
A schematic diagram of this two-stage CSTR system is shown in Fig.<br>
2, and the following description has reference to that figure. According to this<br>
embodiment, the Growth Stage is operated at a liquid retention time (LRT) of about<br>
24 hours. The Growth Stage CSTR 1 is fed enough pantothenate or cobalt in the<br>
medium 2 to yield a healthy culture (and may produce some acetic acid as well).<br>
Thus, excess acetic acid is produced in the reactor, but with increased stability. This<br>
pantothenate or cobalt concentration is in excess of what would normally be fed to a<br>
single CSTR used to produce ethanol. The gas feed to this reactor is unconverted gas<br>
3 from the Production Stage 4 and the liquid feed is fresh medium 2 The Growth<br>
Stage CSTR is operated without cell recycle. The purpose of this Growth Stage<br>
reactor is to provide a healthy culture for later ethanol production that does not<br>
acclimate to low pantothenate concentrations.<br>
The Production stage reactor 4 is operated at a nominal LRT of less<br>
than 20 hours. This CSTR with cell recycle is fed a fresh gas feed 5, and may have<br>
low conversions. It is fed fresh medium feed 6 as well as culture feed 7 from the<br>
Growth Stage. Minimal pantothenate or cobalt is fed to this reactor since the excess<br>
from the Growth Stage is available. Cell recycle 8 is used in this reactor in order to<br>
get the most production out of the cells sent back to the reactor 9. The exit ethanol<br>
concentration in the liquid product 10 should be greater than 20 g/L. The features of<br>
the two-stage CSTR system include little change for acclimation to low pantothenate<br>
or cobalt concentrations; an overall LRT of less than or equal to 30 hours; an<br>
expected greater ethanol productivity and higher ethanol concentration than from a<br>
single CSTR of the same size.<br>
7. Start-up modifications<br>
Still other method steps, which are preferably utilized in the practice of<br>
this invention, involve cell production in the initial start-up of the fermentation culture.<br>
The start-up of a bioreactor fed CO, CO2 and H2 to produce ethanol and acetic acid is<br>
accomplished by batch inoculation from stock culture (Example 11) or by employing a<br>
continuous inoculum from an existing reactor as culture feed (Example 12). As noted<br>
earlier in the discussion of avoiding culture acclimation to low pantothenate or cobalt<br>
concentrations, the culture is most desirably brought up to a high cell concentration<br>
prior to limiting nutrients, but supplying excess H2 to the culture. This rapid start-up<br>
avoids culture acclimation and yields good product ratios (high ethanol and low<br>
acetate concentrations). If the rapid start-up is not employed, poor product ratios can<br>
occur and the culture can acclimate to low liquid phase nutrient concentrations and<br>
require reactor reinoculation.<br>
The reactor is started with a batch liquid phase (liquid medium is not<br>
initially fed continuously to the reactor), at low agitation rates (perhaps 400-600 rpm<br>
in a laboratory New Brunswick Scientific BiofloÂ® reactor) and at the desired pH. The<br>
liquid phase in the reactor thus consists of a batch of nutrient medium containing<br>
vitamins and salts, with a nominal concentration of limiting nutrient, either calcium<br>
pantothenate or cobalt (20 Âµg/L pantothenate or 75 ppb cobalt as an example). If<br>
continuous inoculum from an existing reactor is employed, batch liquid phase<br>
operation likely is not necessary. In this case, gas is fed continuously to the reactor<br>
during initial start-up at a slow rate. Ideally, the gas phase at start-up would be CO2-<br>
free, H2-abundant and the gas rate and agitation rate would be kept at low levels to<br>
avoid CO substrate inhibition.<br>
An exemplary general start-up protocol for producing and sustaining<br>
commercially viable ethanol concentrations from CO, CO2 and H2 consists of three<br>
distinct phases: (a) initial start-up, where cell production is critical; (b) start-up where<br>
production rate becomes critical; and (c) steady state operation. Essentially, initial<br>
start-up is characterized by inoculation of a batch liquid, with a nominal limiting<br>
nutrient, selected from cobalt (75 ppb) or calcium pantothenate (20 Âµg/L) at a desired<br>
pH (typically 4.5-5.5) To facilitate start-up, the gas feed rate and agitation rate are<br>
preferentially kept low, while H, is fed in excess. The cause of ethanol production<br>
during start-up is excess H2; nutrient limitation occurs later. Thus, excess liquid<br>
nutrients are actually present during start-up to avoid unwanted culture acclimation to<br>
low nutrients. As the fermentation proceeds over a period of several hours after<br>
inoculation, CO2 is produced and H2 is consumed. The changes in these rates<br>
indicated that the agitation rate should be nominally increased slowly (perhaps by 200-<br>
300 rpm in a laboratory reactor, over a period of 2-3 days) to avoid mass transfer<br>
limitation.<br>
This onset of CO2 production occurs much more rapidly in systems<br>
employing continuous inoculation as opposed to batch inoculation from stock culture.<br>
However, if the agitation rate is increased too fast, CO substrate inhibition occurs.<br>
This procedure of watching H2 conversion (or CO2 production) while nominally<br>
increasing agitation rate occurs at a relatively rapid rate until the target agitation rate<br>
is reached. During this time of increasing agitation rate in batch liquid culture, cell<br>
production instead of product formation is of utmost importance.<br>
Once the target agitation rate is reached (800-1000 rpm in laboratory<br>
New Brunswick Scientific BiofloÂ® reactor), the culture is allowed to steady to confirm<br>
H2 uptake. The start-up shifts to a mode in which production rate becomes important.<br>
It is desirable to have CO conversions exceeding 80% and a high H2 partial pressure in<br>
the exit gas (at least 0.55 atm) to assure ethanol production while limiting acetate and<br>
the free molecular acetic acid concentration. The liquid medium feed rate is then<br>
turned on (for systems having batch inoculation from stock culture) to initiate<br>
continuous liquid feed and the gas rate is increased in 10% increments toward the<br>
target flow rate. H2 remains in excess to avoid excess acetic acid production. As the<br>
gas rate is increased, the liquid phase nutrients are limited (calcium pantothenate or<br>
cobalt), and the effect of such limitation is a small drop in H2 conversion, at the target<br>
production.<br>
At steady state operation, production of 15-35 g/L ethanol and 0-5 g/L<br>
acetate is reached. At this stage, small adjustments in limiting nutrients, liquid feed<br>
rates and gas feed rates are needed, and are chosen by one of skill in the art with<br>
resort to knowledge extant in the art as well as the teachings of this invention. If cell<br>
recycle is to be added to the method of ethanol production, it is added at this time<br>
along with an adjustment in gas rate (increase) and nutrient concentration (decrease).<br>
The above described methods of continuously producing and maintaining high<br>
concentrations of ethanol with low by-product acetate concentrations under stable<br>
operating conditions enhance the use of the subject bacteria on a commercial scale for<br>
ethanol production. The steps outlined in the methods above overcome the limitation:<br>
of utilizing the subject bacteria for commercial ethanol production from CO, CO2 and<br>
H2. Preferably the method employs a continuous bioreactor, although batch and fed-<br>
batch fermentation methods are also used, but are not likely to be economically viable<br>
for large-scale ethanol production.<br>
The following examples illustrate various aspects, methods and method steps<br>
according to this invention. These examples do not limit the invention, the scope of<br>
which is embodied in the appended claims.<br>
EXAMPLE 1. AN EXEMPLARY METHOD OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
A synthesis or waste gas containing CO and/or CO2/H2 is continuously<br>
introduced into a stirred tank bioreactor containing a strain of C. Ijungdahlii, along<br>
with a conventional liquid medium containing vitamins, trace metals and salts. One<br>
desirable nutrient medium is reported in Table 1 below.<br>
During method start-up using a culture inoculum of 10% or less the reactor is<br>
operated with a batch liquid phase, where the liquid medium is not fed continuously t<br>
the reactor. The liquid phase in the reactor thus consists of a batch of nutrient<br>
medium with a nominal concentration of limiting nutrient, either calcium pantothenat<br>
or cobalt. Alternatively, a rich medium containing yeast extract, trypticase or other<br>
complex nutrients can also be employed.<br>
Ideally, the gas phase at start-up is CO2-free and contains excess H2. The gas<br>
rate and agitation rate are kept at low levels (less than 500 rpm in a New Brunswick<br>
Scientific BiofloÂ® fermentation bioreactor) to yield CO and H2 in slight excess, but at<br>
the same time, avoiding CO substrate inhibition. In a one-liter laboratory New<br>
Brunswick Scientific BiofloÂ® fermentation bioreactor, as an example, where the feed<br>
gas composition is 63% H2, 32% CO and 5% CH4, the agitation rate to initiate start-<br>
up is 400 rpm and the gas rate is 20 ml/min. The cause of ethanol production during<br>
start-up is excess H2; limitation on nutrients occurs later. Thus, excess liquid nutrients<br>
(pantothenate, cobalt) are actually present during start-up to avoid unwanted culture<br>
acclimation to low nutrients.<br>
As the fermentation proceeds over a period of several hours after inoculation,<br>
CO2 is produced from the conversion of CO, and H2 is consumed along with the CO2,<br>
which is a signal to nominally increase the agitation rate to avoid gas mass transfer<br>
limitation. In the New Brunswick Scientific BiofloÂ® CSTR, the exit gas is 25% CO,<br>
67% H2, 2% CO2, and 6% CH4. If the agitation rate is increased too fast, CO<br>
substrate inhibition occurs, as evidenced by a decrease in methane concentration after<br>
an increase in agitation. Thus the agitation rate might typically be increased by 200<br>
rpm in 24 hours. This procedure of monitoring CO2 production (or H2 conversion)<br>
while nominally increasing agitation rate occurs at a relatively rapid rate until the<br>
target agitation rate is reached. A typical target agitation rate in the New Brunswick<br>
Scientific Bioflo* fermentation bioreactor is 900 rpm. During this time of increasing<br>
agitation rate in batch liquid culture, cell production instead of product formation is o".<br>
utmost importance. Thus, cell concentrations of about 1.5g/L are attained, while<br>
typical product concentrations are 10g/L ethanol and 2g/L acetate from the batch<br>
culture.<br>
Once the target agitation rate is reached, the system is allowed to grow to<br>
maximum H, uptake. It is desirable to have very high H, exit concentrations (typicall;<br>
&gt; 60%) to assure ethanol production while limiting acetic acid production. The liquid<br>
medium feed is then turned on (for systems having batch inoculation from stock<br>
culture) to initiate continuous liquid feed and the gas feed rate is increased toward the<br>
target flow rate. In the laboratory New Brunswick Scientific BiofloÂ® fermentation<br>
bioreactor the liquid feed rate is typically 0.5 ml/min, while the gas flow rate is<br>
increased by 10 to 15% every 24 hours toward a target rate of 125 ml/min.<br>
It is important to provide excess H2 in the feed gas to avoid excess acetic acid<br>
production. As the gas flow rate is increased, cell production increases until the<br>
reactor is eventually limited on liquid phase nutrients (calcium pantothenate or cobalt"<br>
as evidenced by a small drop in H2 conversion, at the target productivity. In the New<br>
Brunswick Scientific BiofloÂ® CSTR, this is recognized by a 10% drop in H2<br>
conversion at a target productivity of 20 g/Lâ¢day.<br>
The production method and reactor system are then maintained at a steady<br>
state producing 15 to 35 g/L ethanol and 0 to 5 g/L acetate as products, with only<br>
occasional small adjustments in limiting nutrients, liquid rates and gas rate. Typical<br>
steady state conditions in the laboratory New Brunswick Scientific BiofloÂ®<br>
fermentation bioreactor without cell recycle, are a gas retention time (gas flow<br>
rate/reactor liquid volume) of 20 minutes, a liquid retention time (liquid flow<br>
rate/reactor liquid volume) of 30 hours and an agitation rate of 900 rpm, yielding CO<br>
conversions of 92% and H2 conversions of 60% with pantothenate limitation.<br>
In an embodiment of this method in which cell recycle is added to the reactor<br>
system, it is added at this time along with an adjustment in gas rate (increase) and<br>
nutrient concentration (decrease). With cell recycle in the New Brunswick Scientific<br>
BiofloÂ® CSTR, the gas retention time is typically 8 minutes, the liquid retention time<br>
12 hours, the cell retention time is 40 hours and the agitation rate is 900 rpm. These<br>
conditions typically yield a CO conversion of 92% and a H2 conversion of 50% with<br>
pantothenate limitation.<br>
EXAMPLE 2. SAMPLE ANALYSIS VIA GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY<br>
To achieve and/or maintain proper productivity and ratio, a sample of the<br>
fermentation broth in the fermentation bioreactor must be periodically sampled. A<br>
sample greater than 1.5 ml of culture is taken from the culture in the bioreactor. The<br>
sample is placed in a microcentrifuge tube and the tube is placed in a Fisher Scientific<br>
Micro 14 centrifuge with necessary ballast for balancing. The sample is subjected to<br>
8000 rpm for 1.5 minutes. A 0.500 ml sample of supernatant is placed into a 1.5 ml<br>
vial designed for use in a gas chromatograph autosampler. A 0.500 ml sample of an<br>
internal standard solution containing 5 g/L of n-propanol and 5% v/v, 85% phosphoric<br>
acid in deionized water. The phosphoric acid assures the all acetate is converted to<br>
acetic acid and is detected by gas chromatography.<br>
One Âµl of the prepared sample is then injected by autosampler into a Hewlett-<br>
Packard 5890 Series II Gas Chromatograph equipped with a 007 FFA Quadrex 25m x<br>
0.53mm ID fused silica capillary column. The analysis is conducted with a helium<br>
carrier gas in split-flow mode with 66 ml/min split-flow and 7.93 ml/min injector<br>
purge. The column head pressure is set to 4 psig which yields a column carrier flow<br>
of 7 ml/min. The temperature program is 75Â°C for 0.2 minutes, a ramp to 190Â°C at a<br>
rate of 30Â°C/minute, and a hold time at 190Â°C for 5.17 minutes. The resulting runtime<br>
is 8 minutes. The instrument is calibrated for ethanol (0 - 25 g/L), acetic acid (0-25<br>
g/L), n-butanol (0-5 g/L) and butyric acid (0-5 g/L). Five standards, prepared from<br>
reagent grade materials, are used for the calibration. If the sample is outside the<br>
calibration range of concentration (e.g , &gt;25 g/L ethanol), 0.250 ml of the sample and<br>
0.250 ml of deionized water are placed into the vial with 0.500 ml of the internal<br>
standard and the dilution factor is included in the analysis.<br>
EXAMPLE 3: ACID PRODUCTION IN A LABORATORY CSTR WITH CELL<br>
RECYCLE<br>
A New Brunswick Scientific BiofloÂ® laboratory fermentation bioreactor was<br>
operated with cell recycle using Clostridium Ijungdahlii, strain ERI2, ATCC 55380<br>
for the production of acetic acid from CO, CO2 and H2. The gas feed contained 40%<br>
H2, 50% CO and 10% N,, and the gas retention time to the one-liter reactor was 7.7<br>
to 8.6 minutes. Liquid medium containing vitamins, salts and trace elements was fed<br>
at a liquid retention time of 2.6 to 2.9 hours. The pH was 5.1 to 5.2, the agitation<br>
rate was 1000 rpm and the cell retention time was about 40 hours. Under these<br>
conditions of mass transfer limitation (and not nutrient limitation), the CO conversion<br>
was 94 to 98% and the H2 conversion was 80 to 97%. The cell concentration was 4<br>
to 8 g/L, and acetate was produced at 10 to 13 g/L. No ethanol was produced.<br>
Although the reactor was operated under mass transfer limitation (limited by the<br>
ability to transfer gas to the culture) and thus produced only acetic acid as the<br>
product, the parameters for ethanol production through pantothenate limitation,<br>
cobalt limitation or the presence of excess H2 or CO were monitored to serve as<br>
comparisons for when ethanol is produced as the dominant product.<br>
As shown in Table 2, the Ca-d-pantothenate fed per unit of cells produced was<br>
1575 to 3150 micro-grams per gram of cells produced mg/g-cell produced). Similarly<br>
the cobalt fed per gram of cells produced was 1734 to 3468 mg/g-cell produced).<br>
The specific CO uptake rate was 0.35 to 0.61 mmole/g-cellâ¢minute. The ratio of the<br>
moles of H2 fed to the sum of two times the moles of CO converted and three times<br>
the moles of CO2 converted was less than 0.46. Thus, none of the parameters were in<br>
the desired operating range for ethanol production by the culture.<br>
It is realized that pantothenate and cobalt were fed in large excess to the<br>
reactor above when making acetic acid as the product under mass transfer limitation.<br>
That is, the pantothenate and/or cobalt levels could be decreased significantly and still<br>
be above the levels for pantothenate or cobalt limitation. To illustrate this, the<br>
medium fed to the 1-liter New Brunswick Scientific BiofloÂ® fermentation bioreactor<br>
was modified to significantly decrease cobalt addition to a level that was just above<br>
the concentration of cobalt for cobalt limitation. The reactor again contained C.<br>
Ijungdahlii strain ERI2 for production of acetic acid from CO, CO2 and H2. The gas<br>
feed contained 55% H2, 25% CO, 15% CO2 and 5% CH4 (reference gas), and the gas<br>
retention time was 7.5 to 8.0 minutes. Liquid medium containing salts, vitamins and<br>
trace elements was fed at a liquid retention time of 3.0 to 3.5 hours, and the cell<br>
retention time was 40 hours. The pH was 5.0 to 5.3 and the agitation rate was 900 to<br>
1000 rpm. Under these conditions the CO conversion was 95 to 99% and the H2<br>
conversion was 94 to 9S%. The cell concentration was 2.5 to 4.0 g/L and acetate was<br>
the only product at 10 to 14 g/L.<br>
The Ca-d-pantothenate fed to the reactor per gram of cells was 2250 to 3600<br>
Âµg pantothenate/g-cells produced. The cobalt fed per unit of cells produced was<br>
reduced to a range of 62.0 to 99.2 Âµg cobalt/g-cells produced. The specific CO<br>
uptake rate was 0.325 to 0.4 mmole/g-cellâ¢minute. The ratio of H2 fed to the sum of<br>
two times the CO converted and three times the CO, converted was 0.875.<br>
EXAMPLE 4. ETHANOL PRODUCTION IN LABORATORY CSTRs WITH<br>
PANTOTHENATE LIMITATION<br>
A New Brunswick Scientific BiofloÂ® II laboratory fermentation bioreactor was<br>
operated as a straight through CSTR (without cell recycle) using C. ljungdahlii, strain<br>
C-01 ATCC 55988 for the production of ethanol from CO, CO2 and H2, limited on<br>
pantothenate. The gas feed to the reactor contained 63.3% H2, 31.4% CO and 5.3%<br>
C2H6, (reference gas); fed at a gas retention time of 27 minutes. Liquid medium<br>
containing excess salts and trace elements and a limited supply of pantothenate was<br>
fed to the 1.55 liter reactor at a liquid retention time of 31.4 hours. The pH was 4.6<br>
to 4.7, and the agitation rate was 650 rpm. Under these operating conditions the CO<br>
conversion was 9S%, the H2 conversion was S3% and the cell concentration was 1.5<br>
to 2.0 g/L. Ethanol was produced at a concentration of 15 to 19 g/L, and acetate was<br>
produced at 1.5 g/L. The ethanol productivity ranged from 11.5 to 14.5 g/L"day.<br>
In analyzing the parameters for ethanol production, pantothenate limitation<br>
was seen by operating with a pantothenate feed to cell production ratio of 17.7 to<br>
23.6 Âµg pantothenate/g-cell produced. Compare this ratio to the 2-50 to 3600 Âµg<br>
pantothenate/g-cell produced and 1575-3150 Âµg pantothenate/g-cell produced in<br>
Example 3 for acid production. The cobalt fed per unit of cells produced was 5000 to<br>
6000 Âµg cobalt/g-cell produced, a level that is even greater than in Example 3 and<br>
assures no cobalt limitation. The specific CO uptake rate was 0.23 to 0.30 mmole/g-<br>
cell"minute. The ratio of H2 fed to the sum of two times the CO converted and three<br>
times the CO2 converted was 1.03, and the H2 partial pressure in the exit gas was<br>
0.55-0.64 atm. It is possible that either excess H, or limited pantothenate caused<br>
ethanol production.<br>
Pantothenate limitation for ethanol production was also addressed in another<br>
New Brunswick Scientific BiofloÂ® II laboratory reactor operated with cell recycle<br>
using C. ljungdahlii, strain C-01 ATCC 55988. This reactor was fed gas containing<br>
61.7% H2, 30.6% CO and 5.2% C2H6 (reference gas) at a gas retention time of 12.3<br>
minutes. Liquid medium containing a limited supply of pantothenate along with<br>
excess salts and trace elements was fed to the 2.4 liter reactor at a liquid retention<br>
time of 24.8 hours. Cell recycle was provided by employing a 0.2 mm hollow fiber<br>
membrane, and the cell retention time was 69 hours. The pH was 4.6, and the<br>
agitation rate was 650 rpm. Under these conditions the CO conversion was 90%, the<br>
H2 conversion was 53% and the cell concentration was 2.5 g/L. The ethanol<br>
concentration was 18 g/L and the acetate concentration was 3 g/L. The ethanol<br>
productivity was 17.4 g/Lâ¢day.<br>
In analyzing the parameters for ethanol production (Table 2), the ratio of<br>
pantothenate fed per unit of cells produced was 8.08 Âµg pantothenate/g-cell produced.<br>
Again, pantothenate limitation was assured by operating at a level far less than that<br>
required for acetate production. The cobalt fed per unit of cells produced was 3960<br>
Âµg cobalt/g-cell produced. The specific CO uptake rate was 0.33 mmole/g-<br>
cell-minute. The ratio of H2 fed to the sum of two times the CO converted and three<br>
times the CO2 converted was 1.14, and the H2 partial pressure in the exit gas was<br>
0.60-0.65 atm. Excess H2 could be a potential reason for ethanol production;<br>
however, the high CO, content in the exit gas (0.14 atm) shows that growth was<br>
limited by pantothenate.<br>
In another experiment, C. Ijungdahlii, strain ERI2 was fed 1500 to 3600 Âµg<br>
pantothenate/g cells produced during acetic acid production from CO, CO2 and H2, a<br>
condition where the reactor was not limited on pantothenate (or any other limitation<br>
except for the ability to transfer gas to the culture), and no ethanol was found in the<br>
product stream.<br>
During limitation on pantothenate for ethanol production from CO, CO2 and<br>
H2, C. Ijimgdahlii, strain C-01 was fed 8 to 24 Âµg pantothenate/g cells produced,<br>
while maintaining all other nutrients in excess. Under these conditions, strain C-01<br>
produced 15 to 19 g/L ethanol and 1.5 to 3.0 g/L acetate.<br>
EXAMPLE 5. ETHANOL PRODUCTION IN LABORATORY CSTRS WITH<br>
COBALT LIMITATION<br>
A New Brunswick Scientific BiofloÂ® II laboratory fermentation bioreactor was<br>
operated as a straight through CSTR (with no cell recycle) using C. ljungdahlii, strain<br>
C-Ol, ATCC 55988 for the production of ethanol from CO, CO2 and H2 with cobalt<br>
limitation. The gas fed to the reactor contained 60% H2, 35% CO and 5% CH4<br>
(reference gas), and was fed at a gas retention time of 14 minutes. Liquid medium<br>
containing excess salts, vitamins and trace metals (except for cobalt, which was<br>
limiting) was fed to the 2.5 L reactor at a liquid retention time of 40 hours. The pH<br>
was 4.9 and the agitation rate was 650 rpm. Under these conditions the CO<br>
conversion was 91%, while the H2 conversion varied from 20 to 80%, but was<br>
nominally 55%. Ethanol was produced at 26 g/L, acetate was produced at 4g/L and<br>
the cell concentration was 2.5 g/L. The ethanol productivity was 15.6 g/Lâ¢day.<br>
In analyzing the parameters for ethanol production, the ratio of the<br>
pantothenate fed to the cell production was 15.2 Âµg pantothenate/g-cell produced.<br>
This level was quite low, such that cobalt limitation might not be assured in favor of<br>
pantothenate limitation. Cobalt limitation was seen by operating with 33.3 Âµg<br>
cobalt/g-cell produced, a level which is 100 times less than used in reactors without<br>
cobalt limitation. The ratio of the H2 fed to the sum of two times the CO converted<br>
and three times the CO2 converted was 0.94. The specific CO uptake rate was 0.37<br>
mmole/g-cellâ¢minute.<br>
Cobalt limitation for ethanol production was also demonstrated in a CSTR<br>
with cell recycle using C. ljungdahlii, strain C-Ol ATCC 55988. This experiment was<br>
run to demonstrate cobalt limitation in the presence of excess pantothenate, in<br>
contrast to the previous reactor in this example. The New Brunswick Scientific<br>
Bioflo* 2000 laboratory fermentation bioreactor with a 0.2 Âµm hollow fiber<br>
membrane for cell recycle, was fed gas containing 60% H2, 35% CO and 5% CH4<br>
(reference gas) at a gas retention time of 5 minutes. Liquid medium containing excess<br>
salts, vitamins and trace metals (again, except for cobalt which is limiting) was fed to<br>
the 1.2 liter reactor at a liquid retention time of 16 hours. The pH was 5.1 and the<br>
agitation rate was 825 rpm. The cell retention time in this CSTR with hollow fiber for<br>
cell recycle was 40 hours. Under these conditions the CO conversion was 83%, the<br>
H2 conversion was 50% and the cell concentration was 4.2 g/L. The ethanol<br>
concentration was 18 g/L and the acetate concentration was 4 g/L. The ethanol<br>
productivity was 27 g/Lâ¢day.<br>
In addressing the parameters for ethanol production in this reactor (Table 2),<br>
the ratio of pantothenate fed to cell production was 85.7 Âµg pantothenate/g-cells<br>
produced, a level which is 5.5 times greater than in the previous reactor in this<br>
example. Cobalt limitation was seen by operating with 47.6 Âµg cobalt/g-cells<br>
produced. The ratio of H, fed to the sum of two times the CO converted and three<br>
times the CO, converted was 1.03, and the H, partial pressure in the exit gas was 0.60<br>
atm. Again, excess H2 could be a potential reason for ethanol production; however,<br>
the high CO, content in the exit gas (0.1-0.15 atm) shows that growth was limited by<br>
cobalt. The specific CO uptake was 0.50 mmol/g-cell-minute.<br>
EXAMPLE 6. ETHANOL PRODUCTION IN LABORATORY CSTRs WHEN<br>
OPERATING WITH EXCESS CO PRESENT<br>
A high pressure AUTOKLAVâ¢ reactor (Buchi) was operated as a CSTR<br>
with culture circulation and cell recycle using C. ljungdahlii strain C-01 for the<br>
production of ethanol from CO, CO, and H2 in the presence of excess CO for a period<br>
of 50 hours. The reactor was operated at 25 psig and fed gas containing 57% H,,<br>
36% CO and 6% C2H6. The gas retention time was variable, but was nominally 3.0<br>
minutes. Liquid medium containing excess salts, vitamins (including pantothenate)<br>
and trace metals was fed to the 600 ml reactor at a liquid retention time of 8.2 hours.<br>
The cell retention time, obtained by passing the reactor effluent through a ceramic<br>
hollow fiber filter, was 18.5 hours. The pH was 4.5, the agitation rate was 450 rpm<br>
and the liquid recirculation rate was 0.4 to 0.5 gpm. Under these conditions, the gas<br>
conversions were variable, but the CO conversion was nominally 72% and the H2<br>
conversion was nominally 12%. The cell concentration was 2.7 g/L. Ethanol was<br>
produced at 9.9 g/L and acetate was produced at 2.6 g/L. The ethanol productivity<br>
was 29.0 g/Lâ¢day.<br>
In analyzing the parameters for ethanol production, the ratio of the<br>
pantothenate fed to the cell production was 97 Âµg pantothenate/g-cell produced. This<br>
level is sufficiently high to assure that pantothenate was not limiting. The ratio of<br>
cobalt fed to the cell production was 836 Âµg cobalt/g cell produced, again a level that<br>
assures that cobalt was not limiting. The ratio of the H2 fed to the sum of two times<br>
the CO converted and three times the CO2 converted was 1.09, and the H2 partial<br>
pressure was 1.6 atm. The high CO, content in the exit gas (0.5 atm) assures that<br>
excess H2 did not cause ethanol production. The specific CO uptake rate was 1.34<br>
mmol/g-cellâ¢min., a level that assures excess CO as a method of producing ethanol.<br>
The technique of using excess CO for ethanol production was also<br>
demonstrated in another experiment with C. Ijungdahlii, strain C-01 in the<br>
AUTOKLAVâ¢ reactor (Buchi) system, again with cell recycle and with culture<br>
circulation, for a period of 24 hours. In this experiment the 600 ml reactor was fed<br>
gas containing 15.8% H2, 36.5% CO, 38.4% N2 and 9.3% CO2 at a 1.4 minute gas<br>
retention time. The reactor pressure was maintained at 40 psig. Liquid medium<br>
containing excess salts, vitamins and trace metals was fed at a liquid retention time of<br>
4.8 hours, and the cell retention time, obtained by passing effluent through a ceramic<br>
hollow fiber filter, was 19.2 hours. The pH was 4.5, the agitation rate was 1000 rpm<br>
and the liquid recirculation rate was 0.4 to 0.5 gpm. Under these conditions, the CO<br>
conversion was 71.6% and the H2 conversion was 11.8%. The cell concentration was<br>
7.1 g/L, ethanol was produced at 12.0 g/L and acetate was produced at 2.7 g/L. The<br>
ethanol productivity was 60 g/L-day.<br>
In analyzing the parameters for ethanol production (Table 2), the ratio of<br>
pantothenate fed to the cell production was 294 Âµg pantothenate/g-cell produced.<br>
This level is far in excess of the minimum level required to cause ethanol production<br>
due to pantothenate limitation. The rate of cobalt fed to the cell production was 735<br>
Âµg cobalt/g cell produced, again a level that ensures the cobalt was fed in excess. The<br>
ratio of H2 fed to the sum of two times the CO converted and three times the CO,<br>
converted was 0.3. The CO uptake rate was 0.67 mmol/g cell-min., a level that again<br>
assures that excess CO is available as the method of causing ethanol to be produced.<br>
EXAMPLE 7. ETHANOL PRODUCTION WITH EXCESS H2 PRESENT<br>
A New Brunswick Scientific Bioflo laboratory fermentation bioreactor was<br>
operated as a straight through CSTR (without cell recycle) using C. Ijungdahlii, strain<br>
C-01 ATCC 55988 for the production of ethanol from CO, CO2 and H2 in the<br>
presence of excess H2. The gas feed to the reactor contained 77% H2, 19% CO and<br>
4% CH4 (reference gas), fed at a gas retention time of 30 minutes. Liquid medium<br>
containing excess salts, vitamins and trace elements was fed to the reactor at a liquid<br>
retention time of 36 hours. The pH was 5.0 and the agitation rate was 1000 rpm.<br>
Under these operating conditions the CO conversion was 97-99% and the H2<br>
conversion was 60-80%. The cell concentration was 0.8-1.0 g/L, the ethanol<br>
concentration was 10g/L and the acetate concentration was 3.3 g/L. The ethanol<br>
productivity was 6.7 g/Lâ¢day<br>
In analyzing the parameters for ethanol production, the pantothenate feed to<br>
cell production ratio was 900-1125 Âµg pantothenate/g cell produced, thus assuring<br>
excess pantothenate was present. Similarly, the cobalt feed to cell production ratio<br>
was 991-1239 Âµg cobalt/g cell produced, again assuring that excess cobalt was<br>
present. The specific CO uptake rate was 0.25-0.35 mmol/g cell min, a level such that<br>
excess CO was not causing ethanol production. The ratio of the moles of H2 fed to<br>
the sum of 2 times the moles CO converted and three times the moles CO2 converted<br>
was 1.96, a ratio that is above 1.0, the level where excess H2 is present and thus could<br>
be controlling ethanol production. The H2 partial pressure in the exit gas was 0.70-<br>
0.87 atm, and the ratio of the H2 partial pressure to CO2 partial pressure in the exit gas<br>
was 65. Thus, the reactor was producing ethanol due to the presence of excess H2.<br>
In a second experiment, a high pressure AUTOKLAVâ¢ reactor (Buchi) was<br>
operated as a CSTR with culture circulation and cell recycle using C. Ijungdahlii,<br>
strain C-01 for the production of ethanol from CO, CO2 and H2 in the presence of<br>
excess H2. The gas feed to the reactor contained 81% H2, 16% CO and 3% CH4<br>
(reference gas), fed at a gas retention time of 2.21 minutes. Liquid medium<br>
containing excess salts, vitamins and trace elements was fed to the reactor at a liquid<br>
retention time of 8.97 hours. The cell retention time was 22.7 hours, the pH was 4.5<br>
and the agitation rate was 800 rpm. Under these operating conditions the CO<br>
conversion was 91.5% and the H2 conversion was 43.4%. The cell concentration was<br>
5.5 g/L and the acetate concentration was 2.85 g/L. The ethanol productivity in the<br>
reactor was 215-240 g/Lâ¢day.<br>
In analyzing the parameters for ethanol production, the pantothenate feed to<br>
cell production rate was 46 Âµg pantothenate/g cell produced, a level that may indicate<br>
pantothenate limitation. The cobalt feed to cell production ratio was 460 Âµg cobatt/g<br>
cell produced, a level which assures that cobalt was not limiting. The specific CO<br>
uptake rate was 1.68 mmol/g-cell-min, a level that could indicate that excess CO were<br>
present if it were not for the high H2 uptake rate of 4.14 mmol/g-cell-min, which<br>
indicates that substrate inhibition to the H2 conversion was not occurring. The ratio<br>
of the moles of H2 fed to the sum of two times the moles CO converted and three<br>
times the moles CO2 converted was 5.67, a rate that is far above the required ratio of<br>
1.0 for excess H2 to be present. The H, partial pressure in the exit gas 2.61 atm, and<br>
the rate of H, partial pressure to CO2 partial pressure in the exit gas was 10.9. The<br>
reactor was thus producing ethanol as a result of the presence of excess H2.<br>
A summary comparison of method parameters and results for Examples 3<br>
through 7 is shown in Table 2 below.<br>
EXAMPLE 8. PRODUCT SHIFT IN C. LJUNGDAHLII STRAINS ERI2, C-01<br>
AND PETC USING MEDIUM FORMULATIONS<br>
The methods of this invention can be applied to any of the C. Ijungdahlii<br>
strains. Results from medium manipulation experiments employing strains ERI2, C-<br>
01 and PETC are shown in Table 3 below. The purpose of these experiments was to<br>
demonstrate that each of the strains can be shifted from acetic acid production to<br>
ethanol production merely by manipulating the medium. Thus, a culture was fed<br>
excess nutrients (including pantothenate and cobalt) in order to produce acetic acid as<br>
the dominant product, and then limited on pantothenate or cobalt to produce ethanol<br>
as the dominant product. It should be emphasized that the only purpose of these<br>
experiments was to demonstrate that medium manipulation can result in product shift<br>
for each of the strains. Thus, attaining high product concentrations and productivities<br>
was not a focus of these experiments.<br>
The reactor was operated as a straight through CSTR (no cell recycle) for<br>
each of the culture experiments. The gas retention time was nominally set at 50<br>
minutes, the liquid retention time was nominally set at 40 hours and the agitation rate<br>
was nominally set at 1000 rpm. These conditions were chosen to allow comparisons<br>
of the strains, but not to achieve high productivities.<br>
As noted in Table 3, strain ERI2 was subjected to five changes in medium<br>
which shifted the products back and forth from acetic acid as the dominant product to<br>
ethanol as the dominant product. Both pantothenate limitation and cobalt limitation<br>
were demonstrated for ethanol production by this strain. Strain C-01 was shifted<br>
three times using medium manipulation, again with both pantothenate limitation and<br>
cobalt limitation demonstrated as the mechanism for ethanol production. Strain PETC<br>
was shifted only once, with ethanol production due to cobalt limitation. Each of the<br>
strains showed higher H, conversions when producing acetic acid, rather than ethanol,<br>
as the dominant product. This occurs because acetic acid is produced under mass<br>
transfer limitation (limiting the amount of gas to the culture), whereas ethanol is<br>
produced when limiting nutrients, and thus excess gas is supplied which can negatively<br>
affect gas conversion. Small amounts of acetate are always present in the product<br>
stream when the dominant product is ethanol. However, when acetic acid is the<br>
dominant product, ethanol is usually not present in measurable concentrations. In<br>
shifting dominant products from ethanol to acetic acid by nutrient manipulation, it was<br>
shown that it was very difficult to remove all traces of ethanol. Complete removal of<br>
ethanol occurred only after several weeks of continued operation on acetic acid<br>
enhancing medium.<br>
EXAMPLE 9. STEADY STATE OPERATION WITH AND WITHOUT CELL<br>
RECYCLE<br>
The ultimate commercial goal of producing ethanol from CO, CO2 and H2 is to<br>
achieve high steady state concentrations of ethanol, while at the same time, obtaining<br>
high ethanol to acetate product ratios and high productivity. Steady state data for the<br>
production of ethanol from CO-rich gas containing 20% H2, 65% CO, 10% CO, and<br>
5% CH4 using C. Ijungdahlii, strain C-01 in a straight through CSTR (no cell recycle)<br>
are shown in Table 4. In the table, GRT refers to the gas retention time (ratio of liquid<br>
volume to inlet gas flow rate), LRT refers to the liquid retention time (ratio of liquid<br>
volume to liquid flow rate), and XRT refers to the cell retention time (average amount<br>
of time cells spend in the reactor). As is noted in. the Table 4, ethanol concentrations<br>
of 17.5 to 33 g/L were obtained, and the ethanol productivity ranged from 14.4 to<br>
21.1 g/Lâ¢day.<br>
Similar results are shown for ethanol production from gas that is not as<br>
rich in CO. The gas used in the experiment using C. Ijimgdahlii C-01 without recycle,<br>
for which results are reported in Table 5, contains 16% H2, 27% CO, 6% CO2, and<br>
51% N,. Ethanol concentrations ranging from 11 to 26 g/L were obtained with this<br>
gas, with 2.0 to 5.0 g/L acetate present as a secondary product. The ethanol<br>
productivity ranged from 11.1-20.1 g/Lâ¢day. * The cell concentration is based upon<br>
dry cell weight in Table 5.<br>
Finally, steady state data for the conversion of gas containing 50% H2,<br>
45% CO and 5% CH4 in a CSTR with cell recycle using C. Ijungdahlii O-52 (ATCC<br>
Accession No. 559S9) are shown in Table 6 below. Ethanol concentrations of 18 to<br>
23.5 g/L and acetate concentrations of 3.0 to 5.7 g/L were attained. The ethanol<br>
productivity ranged from 21.1 to 39.0 g/Lâ¢day.<br>
EXAMPLE 10. HIGH ETHANOL PRODUCTIVITY IN A CSTR WITH CELL<br>
RECYCLE AND PRESSURE<br>
A high pressure AUTOKLAVâ¢ reactor (Buchi) was operated as a CSTR<br>
with culture circulation and cell recycle using C. Ijungdahlii, strain C-01 for the<br>
production of ethanol from CO, CO2 and H2. The reactor was operated at 30 psig and<br>
fed gas containing 62% H2, 31% CO and 5% C2H6. The gas retention time was 1.14<br>
min (atmospheric pressure basis), with an actual gas retention time of 3.5 min. Liquid<br>
medium containing excess salts, vitamins and trace metals was fed to the 600 ml<br>
reactor at a liquid retention time of 3.6 hours. The pH was 4.5 and the agitation rate<br>
was 825 rpm. Under these conditions, the cell concentration was 8 g/L, the CO<br>
conversion was 90% and the H2 conversion was 40%. The product stream contained<br>
20 g/L ethanol and 2.75 g/L acetate. The ethanol productivity was 150 g/L-day.<br>
In another high pressure AUTOKLAVâ¢ reactor (Buchi) operated as a CSTR<br>
with culture circulation and cell recycle using C. Ijungdahlii, strain C-01, the reactor<br>
was operated at 6 atm (75 psig) and fed syngas containing 55% H2, 30% CO, 5% CH4<br>
and 10% CO2. The gas retention time was 1 min (atmospheric pressure basis), with<br>
an actual gas retention time of 6.0 min. Liquid medium containing excess salts,<br>
vitamins and trace metals was fed to the reactor at a liquid retention time of 1.62 hi.<br>
The cell retention time was 24 hr, the pH was 4.5 and the agitation rate was 800 rpm.<br>
Under these conditions, the cell concentration was 2.0 g/L, the CO conversion was<br>
95% and the H2 conversion was 60%. The product stream contained 25 g/L ethanol<br>
and 3 g/L acetate. The ethanol productivity was 369 g/Lâ¢d.<br>
EXAMPLE 11: START-UP FROM STOCK CULTURE WITH EXCESS H2<br>
PRESENT<br>
Start-up using a batch inoculum from stock culture ensures a healthy inoculum<br>
free from contaminants, but is not always successful as an inoculation procedure<br>
because of the rather low cell density employed, especially if the method parameters<br>
such as gas rate and agitation rate are pushed upward too rapidly just after<br>
inoculation.<br>
Start-up using batch inoculum from stock culture is discussed in this example.<br>
To prepare the stock cultures for inoculation of the reactor, cultures of C. Ijiungdahlii,<br>
strain C-01 (ATCC Accession No. 55988) were grown up in 150 ml serum bottles on<br>
CO, CO, and H2 in a rich medium containing 1 g/L yeast extract and 1 g/L trypticase,<br>
in salts and vitamins. The vitamin concentration employed was 0.4 ml/L medium of<br>
an aqueous solution containing 50.5 mg/L calcium pantothenate, 20.6 mg/L d-biotin<br>
and 50.6 mg/L thiamine HCl. Bottles were incubated at 37Â°C in a shaker incubator.<br>
The cultures were grown to the exponential growth phase, as determined by visual<br>
inspection. With each inoculation, approximately 90 ml of stock culture were<br>
transferred from serum bottles to 1 liter of medium, representing 9% by volume<br>
inoculation. A successful inoculation is described below. The outlined procedure can<br>
be repeated several times to obtain a successful inoculation.<br>
In obtaining a successful inoculation, 90 ml/L of inoculum were added to a 1<br>
liter batch of basal medium (shown in Table 1) containing 0.4 ml/L vitamins and salts<br>
(t=0). The agitation rate was 240 rpm, the pH was 5.3, the temperature was 38.5Â°C<br>
and the gas retention time (continuous gas flow) was 110 minutes. The gas feed<br>
contained 62% H2, 31% CO and 7% C2H6. After 13 hr (t=13 hr) some CO<br>
conversion was noted, and at t=23 hr the agitation rate was increased from 240 rpm<br>
to 300 rpm. The gas retention time was decreased to 100 minutes at t = 27 hr, and a<br>
further decrease in gas retention time was made at t = 46 hr. The agitation rate was<br>
also increased in 100 rpm increments at t = 28 hr, 59 hr, 72 hr and 85 hr.<br>
By t= 110 hr, the system was operating with a gas retention time of 80<br>
minutes and an agitation rate of 600 rpm. The cell concentration was 0.5 g/L and the<br>
CO conversion was 35%. There was still no H2 conversion, but small amounts of<br>
ethanol and acetate (~ 1g/L each) had accumulated in the batch culture broth. The<br>
efforts up until this time emphasized cell growth in the reactor.<br>
Medium flow using the same concentrations as in basal medium was started at<br>
a rate of 0.4 ml/min at t = 120 hr. A program of nominal increases in gas rate,<br>
agitation rate and medium rate was then initiated while carefully maintaining the<br>
system under excess H2. By t = 210 hr, the ethanol concentration was 17 g/L, the<br>
acetate concentration was 1 g/L, the cell concentration was 1.6 g/L, the CO<br>
conversion was nearly 100% and the H, conversion was 90%. The ethanol<br>
productivity reached 11.4 g/Lâ¢day.<br>
A program of gradual gas rate increases was again started. Concurrent<br>
vitamin (see Table 1) increases were made to bring the vitamin addition rate to 0.7<br>
ml/L medium. By t = 610 hr, the reactor was producing 20 g/L ethanol and about 2<br>
g/L acetate. The CO conversion was nearly 100% and the H, conversion was 85%.<br>
The ethanol productivity reached 14 g/Lâ¢day.<br>
EXAMPLE 12. START-UP USING INOCULUM FROM EXISTING CSTR<br>
The start-up of a CSTR using continuous inoculum from an existing CSTR is<br>
much faster and is more dependable than a start-up from batch bottles of stock<br>
culture. A CSTR containing Isolate C. Ijungdahlii, strain C-01 (ATCC Accession<br>
No. 559S8), that had nearly ceased ethanol production and was producing 2-3 g/L<br>
ethanol, 7-8 g/L acetate and about 0.3 g/L butanol as the liquid phase products, was<br>
restarted using a continuous inoculum from an existing CSTR.<br>
The CSTR from which the inoculum was taken was producing about 17 g/L<br>
ethanol and 1-2 g/L acetate, while operating at a gas retention time of 25 minutes, a<br>
liquid retention time of 32 hours, an agitation rate of 650 rpm, a temperature of<br>
38.5Â°C and pH 4.66. The cell concentration was 1.7 g/L, the CO conversion was<br>
essentially 100% and the H2 conversion was S5%.<br>
Continuous inoculum addition was started (t=0), and at this time, the agitation<br>
rate was reduced to 500 rpm and the gas retention time was set at 38 minutes.<br>
Effluent from the productive reactor (0.5 ml/min) served as the continuous inoculum<br>
for the CSTR being inoculated, with continuous inoculation occurring over a period<br>
of several hours. By t = 5 hr (5 hr after the onset of continuous inoculation), gas<br>
conversion was noted, and the agitation rate was increased to 700 rpm. The<br>
continuous inoculum was turned off at t = 28 hr. The gas conversions improved<br>
steadily, allowing steady increases in gas rate (lowered gas retention times) and an<br>
agitation rate increase to 750 rpm. By t = 30 hr, the CO conversion was 95% and the<br>
H2 conversion was 80%. The ethanol concentration was 13 g/L and acetate<br>
concentration was 1.5 g/L, and it steadied at 1.4 g/L for well over 100 hours. During<br>
this time period, the ethanol productivity was 10 to 15 g/Lâ¢day.<br>
EXAMPLE 13. RECOVERY FROM SEVERE METHOD UPSET<br>
A CSTR with cell recycle containing C. ljungdahlii, strain C-01 being<br>
continuously fed gas and liquid nutrients and producing 15-35 g/L ethanol and 0-5 g/L<br>
acetate at a steady state (e.g., Example 1) is upset due to unforeseen changes in<br>
method conditions, e.g., mechanical problems in the reactor. Upset to the reactor<br>
system can either be minor, such as a brief increase in the gas rate which causes short-<br>
term substrate inhibition, or major, such as a longer term increase in the gas rate<br>
which eventually leads to increased acetic acid production and more severe molecular<br>
acetic acid product inhibition.<br>
Short-term upsets are easily corrected by merely readjusting the upset<br>
parameter (for example, lowering the gas rate to its original level) and monitoring the<br>
progress of the reactor to assure that the upset has not led to a longer-term problem.<br>
However, acetic acid product inhibition is a more severe problem. If excess<br>
molecular acetic acid is produced by the culture as a result of long term substrate<br>
inhibition, excess nutrient addition, CO2 accumulation or mechanical problems of<br>
many types, the problem that led to the excess acetic acid must first be corrected. The<br>
excess acetic acid, which quickly leads to product inhibition, is then cleared from the<br>
system by increasing the liquid rate to wash the acetic acid (and unfortunately ethanol)<br>
from the system. Once the acetate level is below 3-5 g/L, the liquid rate is reset and<br>
the reactor is placed back under either excess H2 feed, or vitamin or cobalt limitation<br>
(with or without cell recycle). Bringing the reactor back involves reducing the gas<br>
rate to avoid substrate inhibition and/or agitation rate before cell washout and lysis<br>
takes place. The agitation rate or gas rate is then increased, as described in<br>
Example 1.<br>
In one specific example, a CSTR with cell recycle containing C. ljungdahlii,<br>
strain C-01 that was producing ethanol and acetic acid from CO, CO2 and H2 began<br>
producing acetic acid in response to a mechanical, problem. The 2100 ml reactor was<br>
fed gas containing 62% H2, 31% CO and 7% C2H6 at a gas retention time of 15<br>
minutes, and was operating with an agitation rate of 600 rpm and a pH of 4.86. The<br>
liquid retention time was 23 hours and the cell retention time was 68 hours. B-<br>
vitamin solution (an aqueous mixture of 50.5 mg/1 calcium pantothenate, 20.6 mg/L d-<br>
biotin and 50.6 mg/L thiamine HCl) was present in the liquid nutrient medium<br>
containing salts and vitamins at a concentration of 0.4 ml vitamin solution per liter of<br>
medium (see Table 2). The ethanol concentration fell to 7 g/L, while the acetate<br>
concentration rose to 7 g/L, conditions that are neither stable for operating the reactor<br>
nor economical for ethanol production. The cell concentration was 2.4 g/L, the CO<br>
conversion was 85% and the H2 conversion was 25%.<br>
The strategy used in recovering the reactor consisted of first dramatically<br>
reducing the gas feed rate to the reactor, followed by gradual recovery of the reactor<br>
in the presence of excess H2 . The liquid rate to the reactor was not reduced to clear<br>
product inhibition in this example because the acetate concentration was not<br>
exceedingly high. Instead, the acetate concentration was allowed to more gradually<br>
drop to non-inhibiting levels with the reduction in gas flow rate and subsequent<br>
operation in the presence of excess H2. The specific procedure in recovering the<br>
reactor is discussed below.<br>
Cell recycle was turned off and the gas rate was dramatically reduced by 70%<br>
to a gas retention time of 62 minutes, while only slightly adjusting the liquid retention<br>
time from 23 to 30 hours (t=0). The vitamin concentration in the medium was not<br>
changed. With this change in gas rate the CO conversion increased to 98% and the H2<br>
conversion increased to 80%. More importantly the system had excess H2 present, as<br>
evidenced by the decrease in CO2 in the outlet gas from 19 to 5%. With the onset of<br>
excess H2, the acetate concentration fell while the ethanol concentration increased. At<br>
t = 66 hr (66 hr after turning off cell recycle), for example, the acetate concentration<br>
had fallen to 4 g/L and the ethanol concentration had risen slightly to 7.5 g/L.<br>
The presence of excess H2 (and the lowered acetate concentration) permitted<br>
subsequent increases in gas rate, first slowly and then at a faster rate. By t = 215 hr<br>
the gas retention was 29 minutes, the ethanol concentration was 12 g/L and the<br>
acetate concentration was 3 g/L. The ethanol productivity was S g/L-day. CO2 was<br>
present in the outlet gas at 6%, the CO conversion was 98% and the H2 conversion<br>
was 80%. By t = 315 hr, the ethanol concentration was 16 g/L and the acetate<br>
concentration was 4 g/L, again with good gas conversions, and a gas retention time of<br>
20 minutes. The ethanol productivity was 11 g/Lâ¢day. By t = 465 hr, the ethanol<br>
concentration had reached 20 g/L, with 3.5-4 g/L acetate also present. The ethanol<br>
productivity was 16 g/Lâ¢day. The gas retention time had been dropped to 16 minutes,<br>
with CO and H2 conversions of 95 and 73%, respectively. These conditions were<br>
maintained for nearly 200 hours of continuous operation, demonstrating that the<br>
reactor system had recovered its ability to produce ethanol and had essentially<br>
retained the previous operating conditions.<br>
EXAMPLE 14. ETHANOL PRODUCTION METHOD WITH OVERSUPPLY OF<br>
CO<br>
A simple experiment was performed in a continuous high pressure stirred tank<br>
reactor with cell recycle to demonstrate the shift from acetic acid production to<br>
ethanol production due to the presence of high CO concentrations. Prior to this<br>
experiment the reactor containing C. Ijungdahlii, strain C-01 was operated at a<br>
pressure of 20-25 psig and fed gas containing 57% H2, 36% CO and 7% C2H6. The<br>
gas retention time was less than 2 minutes, the liquid retention time was 38 hours, the<br>
cell retention time was 28 hours, the agitation rate was 600 rpm and the temperature<br>
was 38Â°C. Under these conditions the CO conversion was variable and averaged<br>
85%, and the H2 conversion was variable and averaged 20%. The cell concentration<br>
was about 2.5 g/L, and the product stream contained 9 g/L ethanol and 3 g/L acetate.<br>
As a first step in preparing for the test, the gas retention time was increased in<br>
order to ensure that excess CO was not present. The pressure was maintained at 23-<br>
24 psig. The pH was followed long enough to ensure that it was stable in the normal<br>
operating range of 4.5 - 4.6. Pure CO was then blended with the regular feed gas to<br>
yield a gas feed of 47% H2, 47% CO and 6% C2H6 at a gas retention time of 2.3<br>
minutes The reactor pH, exit gas composition, and product stream were then<br>
monitored with time.<br>
Table 7 shows the pH changes and product compositions with time after the<br>
addition of extra CO to the system. Thirty minutes after the CO addition, the reactor<br>
pH had increased to 5.25 and the culture had shifted 1.54 g/L (0.0257 mole/L) acetate<br>
to 1.12 g/L (0.0243 mole/L) ethanol. The pH increase occurred as a result of the<br>
free acetic acid being converted to ethanol. Accompanying this change was a<br>
decrease in CO conversion from 91% to 71%. In decreasing the culture circulation<br>
rate from 0.4 gpm to 0.15 gpm, the reactor pH fell, but the ethanol and acetate<br>
concentrations held.<br>
Fifty minutes after CO introduction the ethanol concentration was 11.29 g/L<br>
and the acetate concentration was 1.75 g/L. At this time, the excess CO was turned<br>
off and the ethanol concentration and pH began to fall, and the acetate concentration<br>
began to rise. The decrease in pH was due to the conversion of ethanol to molecular<br>
acetic acid. The ethanol-acetic acid shift through oversupply of CO is thus reversible.<br>
EXAMPLE 15. WATER RECYCLE TO MINIMIZE Acetate PRODUCTION<br>
The recycle of method water back to the fermentation bioreactor after<br>
distillation to recover ethanol is essential to minimize effluent production, and to<br>
maximize the yield of ethanol from the reactor, and to limit the acetic acid production.<br>
Distillation has been found to be the most economical method for concentrating 15-35<br>
g/L ethanol obtained from the reactor to 95% ethanol. Adsorption with molecular<br>
sieves is then used to further concentrate the ethanol to the desired concentration. In<br>
performing the distillation, 95% ethanol in water is produced as the overhead product.<br>
Water is generated as the bottoms product during distillation. The bottoms product<br>
contains acetic acid from the reactor produced during fermentation (3-5 g/L acetate)<br>
and any nutrients not used up during fermentation or destroyed by the heat of<br>
distillation, such as trace metals and other minerals. The recycle of nutrients<br>
minimizes the quantity of effluent, that must be treated as well as the quantity of<br>
nutrients that must be subsequently added to the fermentation bioreactor. The recycle<br>
of acetate prevents the formation of further acetic acid by establishing equilibrium<br>
between the ethanol and acetic acid. Thus, no net acetic acid is produced with water<br>
recycle. Recycle of more than 3-5 g/L acetate can result in acetic acid inhibition in the<br>
reactor. Thus, as a result of water containing acetate recycle, the substrate CO, CO2<br>
and H2 can be converted to ethanol as the only product.<br>
Table 8 shows results for the fermentation of gas containing 50% CO, 45% H2<br>
and 5% CH4; using C. Ijungdahlii, strain O-52 with water recycle. In these<br>
experiments, the permeate from hollow fiber filtration used for cell recycle was sent to<br>
distillation. After removing ethanol, the water was filtered with a 0.2 micron filter to<br>
remove any precipitated by-products. The fraction of water recycled compared to the<br>
total water (as medium) fed to the reactor in these experiments ranged from 25-100%.<br>
The experiment with 100% water recycle lasted for nearly 500 hours or about 20<br>
liquid retention times. As is noted in the results with 100% water recycle, no net<br>
acetic acid was produced. In fact, a small amount of acetic acid was eventually<br>
consumed. The ethanol productivity ranged from 12 to 27 g/Lâ¢day.<br>
EXAMPLE 16. TWO-STAGE CSTR SYSTEM WITH PANTOTHENATE FEED<br>
TO THE GROWTH STAGE<br>
The proper pantothenate feed to the growth stage is a variable that must be<br>
optimized. Typical results from a Growth Stage Reactor using C. Ijungdahlii C-01<br>
were described in Examples 11 and 12, with the exception that a bit more acetic acid<br>
would be produced in this reactor since additional pantothenate or cobalt is fed to the<br>
Growth Stage to ensure a healthy and stable culture. The vitamin concentration<br>
employed was 0.7-0.8 ml/L medium of an aqueous solution containing 50.5 mg/L<br>
calcium pantothenate, 20.6 mg/L d-biotin and 50.6 mg/L thiamine HCl. The<br>
Production Stage CSTR with cell recycle is fed effluent from the growth stage reactor<br>
and produces ethanol as the predominant product. The pantothenate concentration<br>
fed to this reactor is much lower than in the Growth Stage, only 0.1-0.2 ml total<br>
vitamins/L medium of the aqueous solution containing 50.5 mg/L calcium<br>
pantothenate, 20.6 mg/L d-biotin and 50.6 mg/L thiamine HCl. The gas retention<br>
time in this Production Stage was 11-30 minutes, the liquid retention time was about<br>
20 hours, the cell retention time was 30-50 hours, and the agitation rate was 800-900<br>
rpm. The pH was 5.0 and the temperature was 38Â°C. Once the reactor reached<br>
steady state, the gas retention time was held constant at 11 minutes, the liquid<br>
retention time was set at 19 hours, the cell retention time was constant at 37 hours<br>
and the agitation rate was 900 rpm. The CO conversion averaged 96% and the H2<br>
conversion averaged 60%. The ethanol concentration steadied at 25-30 g/L, with<br>
about 3 g/L acetate also present. The ethanol productivity was 31.6-37.9 g/Lâ¢day.<br>
EXAMPLE 17. REGULATING THE FERMENTATION PARAMETERS TO<br>
AVOID ACCLIMATION TO LOW LIMITING CALCIUM PANTOTHENATE<br>
The acclimation of the culture in the fermentation bioreactor to low limiting<br>
calcium pantothenate concentration is avoided by regulating the fermentation<br>
parameters (gas rate, liquid rate, agitation rate, H2 partial pressure) while avoiding<br>
major changes in nutrients, but instead maintaining a relatively constant nutrient feed<br>
concentration, as follows.<br>
During start-up of a laboratory New Brunswick Scientific BiofloÂ® CSTR, C.<br>
Ijungdahlii, strain C-01 was fed a liquid nutrient stream containing vitamins, trace<br>
minerals and salts necessary to provide nutrition to the culture. The pantothenate<br>
concentration in the nutrient medium was 20 pg/L, a concentration that when coupled<br>
with the slow rate of medium feed ensures that there is more than 100 Âµg calcium<br>
pantothenate fed per gram of cells produced (excess pantothenate) because of low cell<br>
production in the bioreactor. Similarly the cobalt concentration in the medium was 1<br>
ppm, a concentration that ensures cobalt is also present in excess. Instead, the H2<br>
partial pressure in the exit gas was kept in excess of than 0.55 atmospheres by feeding<br>
a gas containing no CO2, 63.3% H2, 31.4% CO and 5.3% C2H6, thus yielding a ratio<br>
of H2 fed / (2 COconwrted and 3CO2 converted) of more than 1 and by carefully regulating the<br>
gas feed rate and agitation rates to achieve greater than 95% CO conversion and<br>
greater than 80% H, conversion. As these high conversions are attained with time,<br>
the cell concentration builds from an initial level of near 0 g/L to about 1.5 g/L.<br>
Since the pantothenate concentration is held constant during this start-up, the<br>
Âµg pantothenate per gram of cells produced gradually decreases until it is less than 15<br>
Âµg pantothenate/g cell produced, a condition which is then pantothenate limited. The<br>
system thus grows into pantothenate limitation. High ethanol:acetate product ratios<br>
are attained throughout the start-up by excess H2. Alternatively the reactor is allowed<br>
to produce acetic acid during the early stages of start-up, with the product ratio later<br>
brought under control through pantothenate limitation.<br>
EXAMPLE 18. LIMITING COBALT TO THE REACTOR<br>
C. Ijungdahlii, strain ERI2 was fed 62 to 3500 Âµg cobalt/g cell produced<br>
during acetic acid production from CO, CO2 and H2, a condition where the reactor<br>
was not limited on cobalt (or any other limitation except for the ability to transfer gas<br>
to the culture), and no ethanol was found in the product stream. During limitation on<br>
cobalt for ethanol production from CO, CO2 and H2, C. Ijungdahlii strain C-01 was<br>
fed 33 to 48 Âµg cobalt/g cells produced, while maintaining all other nutrients in<br>
excess. Under these conditions, strain C-01 produced 18 to 26 g/L ethanol and about<br>
4 g/L acetate.<br>
EXAMPLE 19. AVOIDING ACCLIMATION TO LOW LIMITING COBALT<br>
CONCENTRATION<br>
Acclimation to low limiting cobalt concentration is avoided by regulating the<br>
fermentation parameters (gas rate, liquid rate, agitation rate, CO2 content) while<br>
avoiding major changes in nutrients, but instead maintaining a relatively constant<br>
nutrient feed concentration, as follows.<br>
During start-up of a laboratory New Brunswick Scientific BiofloÂ® CSTR, C.<br>
Ijungdahlii, strain C-01 was fed a liquid nutrient stream containing vitamins, trace<br>
minerals and salts necessary to provide nutrition to the culture. The cobalt<br>
concentration in the nutrient medium was 75 ppb, a concentration that when coupled<br>
with the slow rate of medium feed ensures that there is more than 50 Âµg cobalt fed per<br>
g of cells produced (excess cobalt) because of low cell production in the bioreactor<br>
Similarly the pantothenate concentration in the medium was 20 Âµg/L, a concentration<br>
that ensures pantothenate is also present in excess. Instead, the H2 partial pressure in<br>
the exit gas was kept in excess of 0.55 atmospheres by feeding a gas containing large<br>
quantities of H2 and no CO2, and by carefully regulating the gas feed rate and agitation<br>
rates to achieve greater than 95% CO conversion and greater than 80% H2<br>
conversion. As these high conversions are attained with time, the cell concentration<br>
builds from an initial level of near 0 g/L to about 1.5 g/L. Since the cobalt<br>
concentration is held constant during this start-up, the Âµg cobalt per g cells produced<br>
gradually decreases until it is less than 50 Âµg cobalt/g cell produced, a condition which<br>
is then cobalt limited. The system thus grows into cobalt limitation. High ethanol<br>
yields are attained throughout the start-up by employing excess H2 in the feed.<br>
Alternatively the reactor is allowed to produce acetic acid during the early stages of<br>
start-up, with the product ratio later brought under control through cobalt limitation.<br>
EXAMPLE 20. OVERSUPPLYING HYDROGEN<br>
During operation of a laboratory AUTOKJLAVâ¢ reactor (Buchi)<br>
operated as a CSTR with liquid recirculation and cell recycle, C. Ijungdahlii was<br>
operated with excess vitamins, trace minerals and salts necessary to provide nutrition<br>
to the culture. The reactor was operated with excess H2 present in the feed gas such<br>
that the ratio of the moles of H2 fed to the sum of two times the moles of CO<br>
converted and three times the moles of CO2 converted was 5.67. If this ratio were not<br>
greater than 1.0, excess H2 cannot be present in the reactor and ethanol production<br>
due to the presence of excess H2 cannot occur. Furthermore, the H2 partial pressure<br>
in the exit gas was 2.61 atm, a level that exceeds the requirement of 0.4 atm for<br>
ethanol production due to excess H2. Finally, the ratio of H2 partial pressure to CO2<br>
partial pressure in the exit gas was 10.88, a level which is greater than 3.0 and assures<br>
that enough H2 is present to utilize all of the available carbon. Under these conditions<br>
the reactor produced nearly 26 g/L ethanol and less than 3 g/L acetate. The ethanol<br>
productivity was more than 200 g/Lâ¢day. If any of these above criteria are not met,<br>
the reactor cannot produce ethanol due to excess H2 being present. Another aspect of<br>
H2 abundance is that it results in additional reduced ferredoxin by oxidation through<br>
hydrogenase.<br>
EXAMPLE 21. ALLEVIATING CO SUBSTRATE INHIBITION<br>
A laboratory New Brunswick Scientific BiofloÂ® CSTR operating at an<br>
agitation rate of 800 rpm shows an outlet CO concentration of 10% when it had been<br>
previously operating with only 5% CO in the gas outlet. By decreasing the agitation<br>
rate to 600 rpm, CO inhibition was removed and the outlet CO concentration returned<br>
to 5%. This results in increased H2 uptake, a necessary condition to efficiently utilize<br>
all of the gas fed to the reactor.<br>
EXAMPLE 22. MASS TRANSFER<br>
As an example of excess mass transfer leading to ethanol production,<br>
consider a laboratory CSTR with cell recycle containing C. ljungdahlii, strain ERI2<br>
operating without nutrient limitation or excess H2 or CO in the feed gas. That is,<br>
pantothenate is fed at a rate of more than 100 Âµg calcium pantothenate per gram of<br>
cells produced and cobalt is fed at a rate of more than 100 Âµg per gram of cells<br>
produced. H2 is present in the exit gas at about 0.2 atm and the specific CO uptake<br>
rate is less than 0.3 mmol CO/g cellsâ¢min. The agitation rate is 800 rpm. Under these<br>
conditions the culture produces only acetic acid (no ethanol present in the product<br>
stream). If the agitation rate is increased quickly to 900 rpm or the gas rate is<br>
increased by about 10%, ethanol is observed in the product stream, until the cell<br>
concentration increases in order to uptake the gas or until the culture dies due to<br>
substrate inhibition.<br>
EXAMPLE 23. CONTROLLING ACETIC ACID PRODUCT INHIBITION<br>
In a laboratory CSTR which is producing 8 g/L acetic acid and 10 g/L<br>
ethanol, the liquid retention time is reduced from 24 hours to 12 hours for a period of<br>
36 hours in an attempt to wash out the excess acetic acid from the reactor which is<br>
limiting the ability of the culture to produce more ethanol. All other reactor operating<br>
and nutrient conditions are held constant. After this period of time, the liquid<br>
retention time is returned to 24 hours and a product stream containing 3 g/L acetate<br>
and 15 to 25 g/L ethanol results. Several attempts in reducing the liquid retention<br>
time are required to clear the product inhibition. Alternatively, H2 is added to the gas<br>
feed to allow excess H2 control, since excess CO2 can also lead to acetic acid<br>
production in favor of ethanol. These modifications prevent excess acetic acid<br>
production, and thus prevent a poor product ratio, and a low ethanol productivity.<br>
Thereafter, the use of excess H2 in the feed gas or limiting liquid phase nutrient<br>
concentration is resumed.<br>
EXAMPLE 24. OVERSUPPLYING CARBON MONOXIDE<br>
C. ljungdahlii, strain ERI2 when fed excess nutrients (pantothenate<br>
and cobalt in excess) and without an abundance of H2 in the feed gas had a specific<br>
CO uptake rate of 0.23 to 0.48 mmol/gâ¢min., and no ethanol was found in the product<br>
stream. However, when C. ljungdahlii, strain C-01 was similarly fed excess nutrients<br>
without an abundance of H2, in the feed gas, but was under a condition where ah<br>
oversupply of CO was causing ethanol production, the specific CO uptake rate was<br>
0.67 to 1.34 mmol/gâ¢rnin. Under these conditions the culture produced 9.9 to 12.0<br>
g/L ethanol and 2.6 to 2.7 g/L acetate.<br>
EXAMPLE 25: CONTROLLING PRODUCT RATIOS WITH CELL PURGE<br>
A gaseous substrate (30% CO, 15% H2, 10% CO2, 45% N2)<br>
fermentation takes place in a CSTR (pH= 5.0, Temperature= 38ÂºC, Pressure = 20<br>
psig) utilizing C. ljungdahlii, strain C-01, with cell recycle (cell retention time = 40<br>
hours and the liquid retention time = 6 hours) and the culture is not limited in growth<br>
by cobalt, calcium pantothenate, or any other nutrient. As the culture grows, a cell<br>
density is attained such that the specific uptake (mmol CO per gram of dry cells per<br>
minute) is below 0.5 and acetic acid is produced preferentially to ethanol. To prevent<br>
this occurrence, the cell purge rate is increased to prevent an increase in cell density,<br>
such that the steady concentration of cells is kept low enough to maintain a specific<br>
uptake higher than 0.5 mmol CO per gram dry cells per minute. In doing so, the cell<br>
retention time is reduced to between 6 and 25 hours.<br>
