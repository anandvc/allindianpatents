				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to an automatic continuous food cooker. In particular for automatic continuous cokoking of grains, cereals, pulses and vegetables.<br>
Caterers, hotels and restaurants providing a large quantity of cooked products like rice, vegetables and dhal at a time, or in businesses preparing secondary preservable products from cooked products, a need for a system for cooking the product continuously but without damaging the taste and the flavor is kneely felt. Using this unit developed it is possible to cook rice continuously within a period of 20 minutes and the cooked rice will have all the required characteristics such as flavors, aroma and taste.<br>
Food products like rice and other grains or cereals are cooked in water, which is absorbed by the product as cooking proceeds. However, vegetables are coked directly in steam, without water. The cereals are boiled, steamed and heated again to evaporate surplus water and to obtain whole grain cooked product. Furthermore, the large scale cooking process is usually controlled by a chef, not by a food technologists and the process of cooking is regarged as an art not a science. Hence, the chefs control over the cooking condition depends on the degree of development of his skills and not on the use of scientific instruments. But the advent of automatic continuous cookers will make this culinary task much easier. This also shifts the skill from the chef on to the machine, which can be suitably incorporated. The two important variables in cooking of foods are the amount of water and the control of heating. The water to product ratio is important in keeping the cooked product from being either too hard or too soft. Controlled heating ensures that grains are lightly heated and cooked completely to the core of the grain.<br>
Catering is developing rapidly with the spread of lunch services in large firms and industries, central kitchens for chain restaurants and the lunch supply scheme for schools. Accordingly the present age requires large cooking plants, which are continuous, automatic and hygienic. Presently batch type or semicontineous rice cooking units using jacketed kettles heated by steams is adopted in institutional cooking. Since the texture varies between batches a<br><br>
uniform product as desired by the consumer cannot be consistently prepared. These units are labor oriented and are not economical when large-scale applications are envisaged. Due to batch type operation the hygiene is also poor. Hence the need arises for the development of a continuous cooking unit having a large capacity along with circumventing above defects. The consumer preference for the product namely fluffy individual grains with cooked flavors or optimally cooked vegetables without the loss of their integrity have to be achieved consistently in the large-scale unit.<br>
Under the above said constraints, it is advantageous if a device is made available for which food products can be cooked within a short period of time and the cooked products are continuously made available for mass consumption.<br>
Reference may be made to Japanese patent JP2147023 by Watanabe Kenji entitled "Automatic contineous rice cooker" dated 1990 -06-06. This invention relates to automatic and continuous rice cooking system, and more particularly to rice cooking. An automatic continuous rice-cooking device is composed of a long steaming pot, which has a screw conveyor at the end of which net shape conveyor is provided. A predetermined amount of rice is sequentially charged into the steam vessel wherein a predetermined amount of water is pooled. While the charged rice is gradually steamed and conveyed toward the terminal end of the vessel by the screw conveyor, the steaming process in which the starch is released from the rice and the gelatination process in which the released starch is gelatinized are conducted. The adsorption process in which the gelatinized starch is adsorbed in the rice once again is conducted in the vessel near the outlet.<br>
The rice thus cooked is discharged onto the duct from steam vessel outlet together with the cooking rice, dropped onto the net conveyor housed in the conveyor passaged in the form of a tunnel, and gradually conveyed toward the end. During conveying the rice is sprayed with hot water vapour both from the top and the bottom, during which time the remaining portion of said adsorption process and the fixing process in which the surface of the cooked rice gain is coated with gelatinized starch are conducted. The cooking juice discharged from<br><br>
the vessel outlet together with the cooked rice is retained in the sump provided below the duct. A portion of the cooking juice in the sump is sprayed on to the rice being conveyed from the end of the conveyor inside the tunnel passage, supplying gelatinized starch contained in the cooking juice on to the grain surface. The remaining portion of the cooking juice in the sump is returned to the vessel at its mid portion where the gelatination process shifts in to the adsorption process. Supplementing the cooking juice containing the gelatinized starch to ensure a sufficient supply of gelatinized starch during the adsorption process.<br>
The drawback of this system that, the process is dividing into three stages ofi gelatinizsition of starch, adsorption of starch and fixing of adsorbed starch. Accordingly, different sections and corresponding devices are assembled to make a Continuous cooker. The three different sections, a screw conveyor, a sump and a perforated conveyor system make the process too costly and the processing time is high. This may not be suitable for all type of food products like vegetables, cerjeals and may be suitable only for grains. Also, it may be difficult to control too ma^y sections to obtain a good product for different applications. The process is suitable for complete cooking and may not be suitable for different unit operations alike blanching and partial cooking as well.<br>
A prior art system available for continuously cooking the rice is disclosed, for Example, continuous gas rice cooker a Japanese Patent No. JP 2001299585 dated 2001-10-30 by Miyake Tadao and Yamamoto Akifumi. Most of the prior art designs available in the literature are variation of this design.<br>
The continuous gas rice cooker includes a plural number of rice cooking pans or pots, a transport means that transports continuously the plural number of rice cooking pans along a transport pass on a conveyor and a heating means arranged at an underside of the transport pass and comprising plural number of heat Sources to heat the rice cooking pans with a predetermined amount of heat. A tunnel is provided that defines a heating chamber by enclosing the conveyor and the heating source. The rice cooking pans are sequentially transported in the heatirtg chamber to heat the rice cooking pans in the heating chamber during transportation.<br>
Reference may be made to an Indian patent No. 189422 (951/DEL/94) dated 27-7-94 by Ramesh, M.N., Srinivasa Rao, P.N and Subbarao, V.N entitled "A continuous rice cooking unit". The continuous cooker has been developed for cooking rice within a short time and made available continuously which comprises of a screw conveyor with atleast twin screws housed in a chamber, the conveyor being fixed to the wall of the chamber, the chamber being jacketed for circulation of steam, the top cover of the chamber having an opening and being connected to a steam spreader housed inside the chamber and above the screws, the spreader provided with nozzles per sparging steam on to the screws, the chamber being also provided with an inlet and outlet for feeding raw rice and withdrawing the cooked rice respectively, the outlet being provided at the bottom of the chamber with a chute and the inlet provided at the top of the chamber connected to a feeder, a water inlet is also provided at the top of the chamber near the inlet of the rice, a rotary feeder being attached to the inlet so as to control the feeding of a raw rice into the chamber, the other end of the chamber being provided with hopper for control feeding of rice, the screws of the conveyor being connected to a variable speed drive in an approximate manner so as to rotate the screws.<br>
The drawback of the above system is that, it is not automatic and the parameters have to be controlled manually. Also, vegetables cannot be cooked with the existing setup.<br>
