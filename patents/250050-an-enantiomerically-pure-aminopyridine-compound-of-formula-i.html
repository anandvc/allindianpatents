				<td>The present invention relates to an enantiomerically pure compound of formula 1.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates generally to novel chemical compounds and methods. More particularly, the invention provides enantiomerically pure aminoheteroaryl compounds, particularly aminopyridines and aminopyrazines, having protein tyrosine kinase activity, and methods of synthesizing and using such compounds. Preferred compounds are c-Met inhibitors useful for the treatment of abnormal cell growth, such as cancers.<br>
Background<br>
The hepatocyle growth factor (HGF), receptor (o-MET or HGFR) receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) has been shown in many human cancers to be involved in oncogenesis, tumor progression with enhanced cell motility and invasion, as well as metastasis (see, e.g., Ma, P.C., Maulik, G., Christensen, J. &amp; Salgia, R. (2003b). Cancer Metastasis Rev, 22, 309-25; Maulik. G., Shrikhande. A., Kijima, T., Ma, P.C.. Morrison, P.T. &amp; Salgia, R. (2002b). Cytokine Growth Factor Rev, 13, 41-59). c-MET (HGFR) can be activated through overexpression or mutations in various human cancers Including small cell lung cancer (SCLC) (Ma, P.C., Kijima, T.. Maulik, G., Fox. E.A., Sattler, M., Griffin, J.D., Johnson, B.E. &amp; Salgia, R. (2003a). Cancer Res, 63, 6272-6281).<br>
c-MET is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is encoded by the Mel proto-oncogene and transduces the biological effects of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), which is also referred to as scatter factor (SF). Jiang et al., Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 29. 209-24B (1999). c-MET and HGF are expressed in numerous tissues, although their expression is normally confined predominantly to cells of epithelial and mesenchymal origin, respectively. c-MET and HGF are required for norma! mammalian development and have been shown to be important in ceil migration, cell proliferation and survival, morphogenic differentiation, and organization of 3-dimensional tubular structures (e.g., renal tubular cells, gland formation, etc.). In addition to its effects on epithelial cells, HGF/SF has been reported to be an angiogenic factor, and c-MET signaling in endothelial cells can induce many of the cellular responses necessary for angiogenesis (proliferation, motility, invasion).<br>
The c-MET receptor has been shown to be expressed in a number of human cancers, c-Met and its ligand, HGF, have also been shown to be co-expressed at elevated levels In a variety of human cancers (particularly sarcomas). However, because the receptor and ligand are usually expressed by different cell types, c-MET signaling is mosl commonly regulated by tumor-strcma (tumor-host) interactions. Furthermore, c-MET gene amplification, mutation, and rearrangement have been observed in a subset of human cancers. Families with germline mutations that activate c-MET kinase are prone to multiple kidney tumors as well as tumors in other tissues. Numerous studies have correlated the expression of c-MET and/or HGF7SF with the state of disease progression of different types of cancer (Including lung, colon, breast, prostate, liver, pancreas, brain, kidney, ovaries, stomach, skin, and bone cancers). Furthermore, the overexpression of c-MET or HGF have been shown to correlate with poor prognosis and disease outcome in a number of major human cancers including lung, liver, gastric, and breast c-MET has also been directly implicated in cancers without a successful treatment regimen such as pancreatic cancer, glioma, and hepatocellular carcinoma.<br>
Examples of c-MET (HQFR) inhibitors, their synthesis and use, can be found in U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 10/786,610, entitled "Aminoheteroaryl Compounds as Protein Kinase Inhibitors', filed February 26, 2004, and corresponding international application PCT/US2004/005495 of the same title, filed February 26, 2004, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.<br>
It would be desirable to have novel c-MET (HGFR) inhibitors and methods of using such inhibitors for the treatment of abnormal cell growth, such as cancer.<br>

Other Technologies<br>
Compounds of the invention may be combined with soluble macromolecular entities, such as cyclodextrin and suitable derivatives thereof or polyethylene glycol-containing polymers, in order lo improve their solubility, dissolution rate, taste-masking, bioavaHability and/or stability for use in any of the aforementioned modes of administration.<br>
Drug-cyclodextrin complexes, for example, are found to be generally useful for most dosage forms and administration routes. Both inclusion and non-inclusion complexes may be used. As an alternative to direct complexation with the drug, the cyclodextrin may be used as an auxiliary additive, i.e. as a carrier, diluent, or solubilizer. Most commonly used for these purposes are alpha-, beta- and gamma-cyclodextrins, examples of which may be found in PCT Publication Nos. WO 91/11172, WO 94/02518 and WO 98/55148, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.<br>
The amount of the active compound administered will be dependent on the subject being treated, the severity of the disorder or condition, the rate of administration, the disposition of the compound and the discretion of the prescribing physician. However, an effective dosage is typically in the range of about 0.001 to about 100 mg per Kg body weight per day, preferably about 0.01 to about 35 mg/kg/day, In single or divided doses. For a 70 kg human, this would amount to about 0.07 to about 7000 mg/day, preferably about 0.7 to about 2500 mg/day. In some instances, dosage levels below the lower limit of the aforesaid range may be more than adequate, while In other cases still larger doses may be used without causing any harmful side effect, with such larger doses typically divided into several smaller doses for administration throughout the day. Kit-of-Parts<br>

Biological Eyamoles<br>
It will be appreciated that, in any given series of compounds, a range of biological activities witt be observed. In its presently preferred aspects, this invention relates to novel compounds capable of modulating, regulating and/or inhibiting protein kirtase activity. The following assays may be employed to select those compounds demonstrating the optimal degree of the desired activity.<br>
Assay Procedures<br>
The following in vitro assay may be used to determine the level of activity and effect of the different compounds of the present invention on one or more of the PKs. Similar assays can be designed along the same lines for any PK using techniques well known in the art A literature reference is provided (Technikova-Dobrova Z, Sardanelll AM, Papa S FE8S Lett. 1991 Nov 4; 292: 69-72).<br>
The general procedure is as follows: compounds and kinase assay reagents are introduced into test wells. The assay is initiated by addition of the kinase enzyme. Enzyme inhibitors reduce the measured activity of the enzyme.<br>
In the continuous-coupled spectrophotometric assay the time-dependent production of ADP by the kinase is determined by analysis of the rate of consumption of NADH by measurement of the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm. As the PK produces ADP it is re-converted to ATP by reaction with phosphoenol pyruvate and pyruvate kinase. Pyruvate is also produced in this reaction. Pyruvate is subsequently converted to lactata by reaction with lactate dehydrogenase, which simultaneously converts NADH to NAD. NADH has a measurable absorbance at 340 nm whereas NAD does not.<br>
The presently preferred protocol for conducting the continuous-coupled spectrophotometric experiments for specific PKs Is provided below. However, adaptation of this protocol for determining the activity of compounds against other RTKs, as well as for CTKs and STKs, is well within the scope of knowledge of those skilled in the art.<br>

Several of the assays described herein are performed in an ELJSA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Sandwich Assay) format (Volter, et al., 1980, "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay.* Manual of Clinical Immunology, 2d ed.. Rose and Friedman, Am. Soc. Of Microbiology, Washington, D.C., pp. 359-371). General procedure is as follows: a compound is introduced to cells expressing the test kinase, either naturally or recombinantly, for a selected period of time after which, If the test krnase is a receptor, a ligand known to activate the receptor is added. The cells are lysed and the lysate is transferred to the wells of an ELISA plate previously coated with a specific antibody recognizing the substrate of the enzymatic phosphorylation reaction. Non-substrate components of the cell lysate are washed away and the amount of phosphorylation on the substrate is detected with an antibody specifically recognizing phosphotyrosine compared with control cells that were not contacted with a test compound.<br>
