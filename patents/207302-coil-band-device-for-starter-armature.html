BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a coil band device for binding the coil ends of a starter armature.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
Pig, 4 is a side elevational view, partly in cross section, of a conventional starter. In Fig. 4, a-plurality of slots 41a are formed around the outer circumference of the armature core 41 of an armature 1. An armature coil 42 is mounted in the slots 41a. The armature coil 42 is made of copper wires each having a rectangular cross section and wound therearound.<br>
The armature coil 42 is bent so as to project from the end of the armature core 41 in the axial direction thereof on the front side of the armature coil 42 as the right side in Fig, 4, thereby forming a front side coil end 42a. in contrast, the ends of the copper wires projecting from the end of the armature core 41 in the axial direction on the rear side thereof as the left side in Fig. 4 are jointed to each other, thereby forming a rear side coil end 42b.<br>
A glass tape 44 is wound around the outer circumference of each of the coil ends 42a and 42b. The glass tapes 44 are provided for the purpose of preventing<br><br>
the coil ends 42a and 42b from being spread and flown by centrifugal force when the armature coil 42 rotates.<br>
In the conventional starter constructed as described above, a copper wire having a rectangular cross section is used in many cases to increase an area occupied by a coil. In particular, this tendency is remarkable in large starters. It is relatively difficult for the coil ends 42a and 42b, which are composed of the copper wire having the rectangular cross section, to spread because it has a large amount of geometrical moment of inertia.<br>
Further, the armature coil 42 has a small number of revolution in conventional starters. Thus, the armature coil 42 has a small amount of centrifugal force and the object of preventing the spread of the coil ends 42a and 42b can be sufficiently achieved by the glass tapes 44 mentioned above.<br>
However, there is recently proposed a starter, in which the numiier of revolution of an armature is reduced through an internal speed reduction mechanism disposed in the starter, to improve an output of the starter, in the starter, the number of revolution of the armature is greatly increased. Accordingly, there is arisen a problem that the conventional glass tapes 44 cannot prevent the spread of the coil ends 42a and 42b.<br><br>
An object of the present invention, which was made to solve the above problem, is to provide a coil band device for a starter annature capable of securely preventing the spread of coil ends and improving the reliability of a starter.<br>
A coil band device for a starter armature of the present invention includes ring members press-fitted on the outer circumferential surface of an armature coil of a starter at the ends thereof with a predetermined pressure, and an insulation means for insulating the armature coil from the ring members.<br>
Further, the ring members are steel rings and the insulation means is insulation tapes wound around the armature coil between it and the steel rings for insulating the armature coil from the steel rings.<br>
Further, the ring members are steel rings and the insulation means is a resin coated on the steel rings.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a coil band device for a starter annature comprising ; ring members press-fitted on the outer circumferential surface of an armature coil of a starter at the ends thereof; and an insulation means for insulating said armamre coil from said ring members.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Embodiment 1<br>
Fig. 1 is a side elevational view of a starter of an embodiment l of the present invention with a portion thereof shown in cross section. Fig. 2 is a side elevational view of an armature explaining a coil band device for an starter armature of the present invention. In Fig. 1,  a starter 100 includes an armature 1. A sun gear 3 is formed on the armature shaft 2 of the armature 1.<br>
A plurality of planetary gears 4 are disposed around the outer circumference of the sun gear 3 so as to be meshed with the sun gear 3. Each of the planetary gears 4 has a planetary gear center shaft 5 at the center thereof. A needle bearing 6 is interposed between each planetary gear 4 and the planetary gear center shaft 5 thereof. Then, each planetary gear center shaft 5 pivotally supports each planetary gear 4.<br>
The respective planetary gear center shafts 5 are fastened to a planetary gear carrier 7. Then, the plurality<br><br>
of planetary gears 4 are supported by the planetary gear carrier 7 through the planetary gear center shafts 5. The planetary gear carrier 7 is fastened to an output shaft 8.<br>
on the other hand, an internal gear member 10 is fixed on the inside of a front bracket 80. The internal gear member 10 includes an internal gear portion 10a to be meshed with the planetary gears 4 and a flange portion 10b extending from the internal gear portion 10a in a center direction.<br>
A needle bearing 12 is interposed between the flange portion 10b of the internal gear member 10 and the planetary gear carrier 7,<br>
When the armature 1 rotates, the sun gear 3 formed on the armature shaft 2 is rotated. The sun gear 3 rotates the planetary gears 4. Each planetary gear 4 turns on its own axis while revolving around the sun gear 3. The revolving motion of each planetary gear 4 around the sun gear 3 is transmitted to the output shaft 8 through the planetary gear center shaft 5 thereof. The sun gear 3, the planetary gears 4 and the planetary gear carrier 7 constitute an internal speed reduction mechanism, with this construction, the revolution of the armature 1 is transmitted to the output shaft 8 after it is greatly reduced. The internal speed reduction mechanism has a reduction ratio of about 4.3.<br>
Further, the output shaft 8 includes an over-running<br><br>
clutch 20 coupled therewith through helical splines Ba and 21a.<br>
The output shaft 8 has a large diameter portion 8b at the rear end thereof as the armature 1 side. The over¬running clutch 20 is composed of a clutch outer 21, which is coupled with the output shaft 8 through the helical splines 8a and 21a, and an clutch inner 22, which is coupled with the clutch outer 21 through a roller 23 and transmits rotation in one direction to a pinion 26 at a front end.<br>
A helical spline is composed of the output shaft helical spline 8a, which is a convex portion extending spirally in an axial direction and formed on the output shaft 8, and the clutch outer helical spline 21a, which is a concave portion formed to the clutch outer 21 and engaged with the output shaft helical spline 8a. The over-running clutch 20 is advanced and retracted on the output shaft 8 by a shift lever 25. Then, the over-running clutch 20 advances and retracts and returns the pinion 26 disposed at the front end.<br>
Next, operation of the starter 100 will be described. Turning on a start switch of an engine of a vehicle and the like energizes the not shown exciting coil of an electromagnetic switch 110 and a not shown plunger is drawn and retracted inwardly so that the shift lever 25 is rotated counterclockwise in Fig. 1. Then, the over-running clutch<br><br>
20 is moved forward. With this operation, the pinion 26 is meshed with the ring gear of the engine. Thereafter, the armature 1 rotates and the rotational force thereof is transmitted to the output shaft 8. The rotation of the armature 1 is further transmitted to the pinion 26 through the over-running clutch 20 so as to start the engine by rotating the ring gear thereof.<br>
When the engine starts, the engine rotating at high speed drives the pinion 26 in the same direction as the engine. However, the driving force is not transmitted to the armature by the existence of the over-running clutch 20.<br>
When the engine starts and the start switch is turned off, the plunger of the electromagnetic switch 110 is advanced and returned so as to rotate clockwise and return the shift lever 25. As a result, the over-running clutch 20 is retracted and returned.<br>
In Fig. 2, a plurality of slots 41a are formed around the outer circumference of the armature core 41 of an armature 1. An armature coil 42 is mounted in the slots 41a. The armature coil 42 is made of uncoated, naked copper wires each having a rectangular cross section and wound therearound.<br>
The armature coil 42 is bent so as to project from the end of the armature core 41 in the axial direction thereof on the front side as the right side of Fig. 2,  thereby<br><br>
forming a front side coil end 42a. in contrast, the ends of the copper wires projecting from the end of the armature core 41 in the axial direction on the rear side thereof as the left side of Fig. 2 thereof jointed to each other, thereby forming a rear side coil end 42b.<br>
A steel ring 50 as a ring member is fitted on the outer circumferential surface of each of the coil ends 42a and 42b. The steel ring 50 is press fitted on each of the coil ends 42a and 42b with a predetermined pressure. The steel rings 50 are provided for the purpose of preventing the coil ends 42a and 42b from being spread and flown by centrifugal force when the armature coil 42 rotates. An insulation tape 51 as an insulation means is wound between the steel ring 50 and each of the coil ends 42a and 42b.<br>
Each steel ring 50 is slightly tapered on both the edges in the axial direction thereof so as to be easily press fitted. Further, the steel ring 50 has a spring property such as a binding spring and tightens the coil ends 42a and 42b with a predetermined pressure.<br>
The outer circumferential surfaces of the coil ends 42a and 42b are entirely applied with varnish in a final process. While the varnish is applied for the purpose of insulation and fastening between the coils, it also has a purpose of fastening the steel rings 50 to the insulation tapes 51,<br><br>
It is preferable that the overall width of the steel ring 50 be about 50% of the length of each of the coil ends 42a and 42b.<br>
The coil band device for the starter armature constructed as described above has the steel rings 50 press fitted on the outer circumferential surfaces of the armature coil 42 of the starter 100 at the ends thereof with the predetermined pressure and the insulation means for insulating the armature coil 42 from the steel rings 50. Accordingly, the spread of the coil ends 42a and 42b can be reliably prevented and the reliability of the starter 100 can be improved.<br>
Further, the insulation means is the insulation tapes 51 wound around the armature coil 42 between it and the steel rings 50 for insulating the armature coil 42 from the steel rings 50. Thus, the insulation thereof can be securely carried out as well as the armature core 41 can be easily manufactured.<br>
In the embodiment, while the uncoated, naked copper wires having the rectangular cross section are used in the armature coil 42, coated copper wires may be used. When the coated copper wires are used, the insulation tape 51 serves as the insulation means as well as protects the coating of the copper wires when the steel rings 50 are press fitted-<br>
It should be noted that the steel ring 50 is not<br><br>
necessarily formed in the ring shape and may be formed in an approximately C-shape with a portion thereof lacked in a circumferential direction so long as it has a predetermined strength. Further, the material of the ring need not always be steel, and stainless steel, aluminum, plastic and the like may be used so long as they have the predetermined strength. Embodiment 2<br>
Fig. 3 is a side elevational view of an armature explaining another example of the coil band device for the starter armature of the present invention. A steel ring 53 coated with a resin as a ring member is fitted on the outer circumferential surface of each of the coil ends 42a and 42b. The steel ring 53 coated with the resin is press fitted on the coil ends 42a and 42b with a predetermined pressure. In the embodiment 2, the insulation tape of the embodiment 1 is not provided. The other construction of the embodiment 2 is the same as that of the embodiment 1.<br>
In the coil band device for the starter armature constructed as described above, the steel ring 53 as the ring member can be easily press fitted in a press fitting process because it is coated with the resin, and more reliable insulation can be realized.<br><br><br>
