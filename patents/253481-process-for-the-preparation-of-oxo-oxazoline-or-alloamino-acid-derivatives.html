TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a method for producing oxo-oxazoline derivatives; using a simple and inexpensive method.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Oxo-oxazoline derivatives are critical intermediates for compounds (WO98/08867) which are TRH (thyrotropin releasing hormone) derivatives represented by the following general formula (VIII):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein RA is a hydrogen atom or optionally substituted lower alkyl; Y is an optionally substituted alkyl.<br>
Further, compounds represented by the following general formulas (III-A), (III-B), (IV-A), or (IV-B): <br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
wherein R1 is an optionally substituted lower alkyl, an optionally substituted aryl, an alkynyl, or an optionally substituted heteroaryl , and derivatives thereof, are useful as tools for combinatorial chemistry.<br>
Conventionally, as a method for producing oxo-oxazolirie derivatives having a lower alkyloxycarbonyl group or a carboxyl group, a method of cyclizing a starting material while retaining its stereochemistry, and a method using cyclization reaction without reference to stereoselectiv.i l;y are known.<br>
4<br>
An example at" the. method of cyclizing a starting material while retaining its stereochemistry is the following :<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
 (Tetrahedron, 48, 2507, 1992). In this reaction, L-allo-threonine used as a starting material is allowed to react with phosgene arid potassium hydroxide in toluene at 0째C for one hour, thereby obtaining a cyclized product which retains its stereochemisty . Unfortunately, this method encounters a problem in industrialization since the method employs L-allo-threonine which is more expensive than its natural type, and phosgene which is toxic to the human body.An example of  the cyclization method without reference to stereoselectivity is the following:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
(Japanese Laid-Open Publication No. 60-34955). In this reaction, a starting material is allowed to react with potassium carbonate in water at 60째C for 1.5 hours to obtain a cyc.lized product . It is believed that the stereochemistry of the material is maintained in view of the mechanism of this method. Therefore, it is considered that allo-threoriirie needs to be used as a starting material in order to obtain a cis-fortn cyclized product.<br>
Although a resultant cyclized product is an oxo-oxazoline derivative which does not have a lower alkyloxycarbonyl group or a carboxyl group, the following method is known:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
(Bull. Chem. Soc . Japan., 44 , 2515, 1971). In this reaction, a starting material is allowed to react in thionyl chloride at 60째C for 24 hours without solvent, thereby obtaining a cyclized product at a yield of 65% . In this method, similar to the method of the present invention, the position of an ethyl group is inverted after the reaction. However, the<br><br>
starting material is not an amino acid derivative, and the relationship between the ammo group and the hydroxyl group of the starting material is different from that of a starting material used in the method of the present invention. Moreover, since the reaction is conducted in thionyl chloride , the yield is as low as 65%.<br>
Similar to the method of the present invention, a cyclization reaction with inversion is known:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
(Heterocycl. Comniun. , 2, 55, 1996). An example in which trifluoroacetic anydride is used in the first step is disclosed. Although in the method of the present invention, the yield of a cyclization reaction is as high as 83%, the yield of the cyclization reaction disclosed in the above-described publication is as low as 40% in both a method using tosyl chloride and a method using trifluoroacetic anydride. Moreover, the method of the present invention is superior in regard to simplicity of reaction.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The production method of the present invention will be described in detail in which a starting material is one optically active substance. When the other material is used, similar reactions can be carried out. When a starting material has a substituent which is an obstacle to a reaction in first to sixth steps shown below, the starting material may be protected in advance in accordance with a method described in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis , Theodora W Green (John Wiley 짙 Sons), and the like, and deprotected in an appropriate stage.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein   R1,   R^,   KJ,   arid   Y   are   as   described   above.<br>
(First step)<br>
In the first step, R2OC (=O)-Hal, wherein Hal is halogen, [R2OC(=0) ]2O, and the like are caused to react with a compound represented by a general formula (V-A) to obtain a compound (VII-A) in which an amino group is protected by R2OC(=0)-. This step can be carried out in accordance with a method described in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis , Theodora W Green (John Wiley &amp; Sons), and the like.<br>
For example, a compound represented by a general formula (V-A) is caused to react with 1.0 equivalent to 3.0 equivalents, preferably 1.0 equivalent to 1.5 equivalents, of R2OC( -0)-Hal, wherein Hal is halogen, and 2.0 equivalents to 6.0 equivalents, preferably 2.0 equivalents to 3 . 0 equivalents , of an organic base ( e . g. ,<br>
triethylamirie, and the like) or an inorganic base (e.g., sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium hydrogencarbonate, potassium hydrogencarbonate, and the like), in a mixed solvent, such as water-toluene , water-dioxane, water-acetone, and the like, or a solvent, such as water, dioxane, and the like at -20째C to 50째C, preferably 0째C to ?.0째C for 0.5 to 3 hours to obtain a compound represented by a general formula (VII-A).<br>
In the above-described IV), "step of protecting an arnino group with R2OC(-0)-" refers to this first step.<br>
(Second step)<br>
In the second step, the carboxyl group of a compound represented by a general formula (VII-A) is esterified to obtain a compound represented by a general formula (II-A). This step can be carried ou t by a commonly used es terif ication .<br>
For example, a compound represented by the general formula (VII-A) is dissolved in a solvent, such as methanol, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, and the like, and allowed to react with 1 equivalent to 5 equivalents, preferably 1 equivalent to 2 equivalents, of ahalogenatingagent, such as thionyl chloride, hydrochloric acid, phosphorus oxychloride, and the like, at -20째C to 50째C, preferably 0째C to 25째C, one hour to 24 hours, preferably one hour to 3 hours to obtain a compound represented by a general formula (II-A) .<br>
In the above-described IV), "step of esterifying a carboxyl group" refers to this second step.<br>
(Third step)<br><br>
The third step is a cyclization reaction in which the stereochemistry of R1 is reversed.<br>
For example, a compound represented by a general formula (I-A) can be obtained in accordance with 1) to 3) described below. 1) a compound represented by a general formula (II-A) is dissolved in a solvent, such as toluene, ethyl acetate, cyclohexane, acetonitrile, and the like, preferably toluene. The amount of the solvent is preferably 1 V to 50 V, particularly 1 V to 10 V, where use of 1 ml of a solvent with respect to 1 g of a starting material is referred to as 1 V. 2)1.0 equivalent to 20 equivalents, preferably 1.0 equivalent to 2.0 equivalents, of thionyl chloride are added at 25째C to 80째C, preferably 25째C to 50째C. Thionyl chloride can be used as a solvent. 3) The reaction solution is stirred at 25째C to 80째C, preferably 60째C to 80째C, for 5 hours to 48 hours, preferably 6 hours to 12 hours.<br>
In this reaction, the closer the equivalent value of thionyl chloride is to 1.0 and the higher the "V" value of the amount of the solvent, the proportion of the cis-form of the intended compound was increased (the proportion of the trans-form was decreased).<br>
The yield of the total compounds of cis-form and trans-form is not substantially affected by the equivalent value of thionyl chloride and the amount of the solvent.<br>
In the above-described IV), "step of treating with thionyl chloride" refers to this third step.<br>
(Fourth step)<br>
In the fourth step, an ester compound represented<br>
by the general formula (l-A) is hydrolyzed to carboxylic acid. This step can be carried out by a commonly used hydrolysis.<br>
For example, a compound represented by the general formula (I-A) is dissolved in a solvent, such as water, and the like, and 0.1 equivalent to 10 equivalents, preferably 1 equivalent to 5 equivalents, of acid (e.g., hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, and the like) are added to the solution at 0째C to 100째C, preferably 25째C to 80째C. The resultant solution is allowed to react at 25째C to 100째C, preferably 50째C to 80째C for 1 hour to 5 hours to obtain a compound represented by a general formula (III-A). This step can be carried out under basic conditions.<br>
(Fifth step)<br>
In the fifth step, a compound represented by the general formula (III-A) is hydrolyzed to obtain allo-amino acid derivatives represented by a general formula (IV-A).<br>
For example, a compound represented by the general formula (III-A) is dissolved in a solvent, such as water, and 0.1 equivalent to 20 equivalents, preferably 1 equivalent to 10 equivalents, of acid (e.g., hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, and the like) are added to the solution at 0째C to 100째C, preferably 25째C to 80째C. The resultant solution is allowed to react at 25째C to 100째C, preferably 80째C to 100째C for 1 hour to 48 hours to obtain a compound represented by the general formula (IV-A).<br>
(Sixth step) (peptide bond formation)<br>
Three amino acid derivatives are subjected to two<br>
peptide bond formation to synthesize a compound (VI) (W098/08867 ) . A compound represented by the general formula (I-A) obtained by the above-described method is used to synthesize the compound (VI) in the following two methods (method A and method B).<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
wherein R4 is the protecting group of a carboxyl group, R5 is the protecting group of an amino group, and R1 and Y are as described above.<br><br>
Method A - Firat step<br>
The carboxyi group of 3 -(4-thiazole)alanine synthesized in accordance with a method described in Synth. Commun., 20, 22, 3507 (1990) and Chem. Pharm. Bull., 38, 1, 103(1990), is protected as an ester, such as methyl ester, benzyl ester, t-butyl ester, diphenylmethyl ester, and the like, resulting in a compound represented by a general formula (VIII). This compound and a compound represented by the general formula (III--A) are subjected to a peptide bond formation.<br>
When the carboxyi group is protected as diphenylmethyl ester, the protecting reaction can be carried out as follows. 3-(4-thiazole)alanine is dissolved in a mixed solvent of an alcohol solvent, such as methanol, ethanol, and the like and a solvent, such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, and the like. 1 to 3 equivalents, preferably 1 to 2 equivalents, of diphenyl diazomethane are added to the solution at 0 to 50째C, preferably 20 to 40째C for 10 minutes to 1 hour, preferably 20 to 40 minutes. The resultant solution is allowed to react at the same temperature for 30 minutes to 3 hours, preferably 1 to 2 hours while being stirred.<br>
The peptide bond formation is described in "Peputido Gosei [Peptide Synthesis]" (Nobuo Izumiya, Maruzen), and the like, and can be carried out by such a commonly used peptide bond formation method.<br>
As commonly used peptide bond formation methods, a method employinq a condensing agent, such as N,N-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), and the like, an azide<br>
method, an acid chloride method, an acid anhydride method, an active ester method, and the like. When a starting material has a substituent (amino, carboxy, hydroxyl, and<br>
the like);which is an obstacle to the peptide formation, <br>
the substituent can be protected in advance in accordance with a method described in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, Theodora W. Green (John Wiley &amp; Sons), and the like, and the protecting group is removed at a desired stage.<br>
A compound represented by the general formula (VIII) and a compound represented by the general formula (III-A) are dissolved in a solvent, such as N,N-dimethylformamide, tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile, and the like. An N,N-dimethylformamide solution of a base, such as triethylamine, and the like, and dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), is added to that solution at -10 to 10째C, preferably in ice bath. 1-hydroxybenzotriazole may be added. The resultant solution is stirred at 10 to 50째C, preferably 20 to 30째C, for one hour to one day, preferably 5 to 10 hours, followed by typical subsequent processes . Thus, a compound represented by a general formula (IX) can be obtained.<br>
Method A - Second step<br>
A deprotecting reaction can be carried out by a commonly used deprotecting reaction (Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, Theodora W. Green (John Wiley &amp; Sons)). For example, when R4 is diphenylmethyl, a compound represented by a general formula (IX) can be rrdded to anisole and trif luoro acetic acid at -10 to 10째C, preferably in ice bath. The mix tuns is stirred at the same temperature for 5 to 30 minutes, preferably 10 to 20 minutes. After the mixture is warmed to 20 to 40째C, the mixture can be stirred for l to 4 hours, preferably 2 to 3 hours.<br>
The resultant deprotected substance can be reacted with a pyrrolidirie derivative synthesized by a method described in Tetrahedron, 27, 2599 (1971) through a peptide bond formation similar to method A - first step, thereby obtaining a compound represented by the general formula (VI) .<br>
Method B - First step<br>
The amino group of 3 -(4-thiazole)alanine synthesized in accordance with a method described in Synth. Commun., 20, 22, 3507 (1990) and Chem. Pharm. Bull., 38, 1, 103 (1990), is protected by a protecting group for an amino group, such as t-butyloxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl, phthaloyl, trifluoroacetyl, and the like to obtain a compound represented by a general formula (X). This compound and a pyrrolidine derivative synthesized by a method described in Tetrahedron, 27, 2599 (197.1) are subjected to a peptide bond formation.<br>
When t-butyloxycarbonyl is used for the protection, the protecting reaction can be carx'ied out as follows. 3-(4-thiazole)alanine is dissolved in a solvent, such as dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile, and the like. Boc2O is added to the solution at 0 to 50째C, preferably 10 to 30째C, and stirred for 1 to 5 hours, preferably 2 to 4 hours.<br>
A pep tide bond formation can be carried out in a manner similar to that of the above-described method A - First step.<br>
Method B - Second step<br>
A deprotecting reaction	for an amino group can be<br>
carried out as follows. When	the protecting group is<br>
t-butyloxycartaonyl, a compound	represented by a general<br>
formula (XI) is dissolved in a solvent, such as ethyl acetate, and the like. 1. to 4 N hydrochloric acid-ethyl acetate solution is added to that solution at -10 to 30째C, preferably in ice. The resultant mixture is stirred at the same temperature for 1 to 5 hours, preferably 2 to 3 hours.<br>
The resultant deprotected substance can be subjected to a peptide bond formation similar to that of method A -First step, thereby obtaining a compound represented by the general formula (VI).<br>
In the production method, a compound represented by the general formula (V-A) or (V-B) is preferably L-threonine orD-threonine (R1= methyl) . Further, compounds represented by the general formulas (VII-A), (VII-B), (II-A), (II-B), (I-A), (I-B), (III-A). (III-B). (IV-A), (IV-B), and (VI) are also preferably compounds derived from L-threonine or D-threonine.<br>
