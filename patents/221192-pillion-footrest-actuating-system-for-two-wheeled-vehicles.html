        COMPLETE SPECIFICATION            SECTION    10<br>
TITLE<br>
"PILLION FOOTREST ACTUATING SYSTEM FOR TWO WHEELED VEHICLES"<br>
APPLICANT<br>
BAJAJ AUTO LIMITED, an Indian Limited Company, of Akurdi, Pune 411 035, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br><br>
23-12-2005<br><br>
This invention relates to cable operated swiveling type pillion footrests for two wheeled vehicles such as scooterettes, scooters and motorcycles. The present invention particularly relates to pillion footrests mounted on chassis of such vehicles. These types of vehicles are termed as 'vehicle' in this Specification.<br>
Pillion footrests are essential parts of any vehicle used for carrying two persons. The conventional pillion footrests are in the form of a fabricated structure or are made from casting and are mounted on brackets, which are either welded or assembled on chassis of the vehicle. These footrests may have rubber or PVC covering. There are two such footrests symmetrically provided, for resting left leg and right leg when the pillion sits on the vehicle astride.<br>
These footrests are held in retracted position (normally, parallel to the longitudinal median plane of the vehicle, pointing towards rear side of<br>
2<br><br>
vehicle) with the help of torsion spring or a similar arrangement enabling it to maintain the position. This position is maintained when the vehicle runs without pillion or is parked. When the pillion user desires to use the pillion footrest Vie needs to put "these in extended position (normally, perpendicular to the longitudinal median plane of the vehicle, pointing towards left and right side), either by driver or pillion user by using foot or hand as per convenience. The above mentioned arrangement of the footrests provided on the vehicles is well known and does not need detailed explanation.<br>
One of the disadvantages associated with known footrests is that for shifting from retracted position to extended position, the rider or pillion has to bend and apply force by hand or shift these with the help of legs.<br>
Yet another disadvantage is that while retracting or extending the footrests, one has to spoil the hands or legs since dust/mud is accumulated on footrests.<br>
3<br><br>
One of the objectives of the present invention is therefore to provide improved pillion footrest actuating system, which will not necessitate manual operation for extending.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide footrests â€¢ which can be extended by the rider while resting on the seat.<br>
In order to avoid difficulties mentioned above, we have invented a pillion footrest actuating system, which is easily operable by the rider. According to this invention, the footrests can be operated by operation of a lever situated in the vicinity of a rider.<br>
The invention provides a pillion footrest actuating system for two wheeled vehicles comprising mainly a chassis, footrest with lug, a lever, cables, a bracket for footrest, bracket assembly for release mechanism, a torsion spring, a compression spring, a release cam or dog, a cable adjusting means, a cable mounting bracket, and bracket for lever. The<br>
4<br><br>
said system with its constituent parts operates in a manner wherein the position of the footrest is actuated by the lever located within rider's reach at front of the vehicle, the lever operates a cable one end of which being connected to the operating end of the lever, another cable joined to the cable through a cable adjusting means, the cables in turn put the foolxest in extended position by compressing spring and releasing lug from the cam or dog and releasing energy of the torsion spring via release mechanism and the footrest loaded with torsion spring is put back to its retracted position by pushing the footrest which releases the cam or dog to lock the lug with the footrest.<br>
According to the invention there is provided a pillion footrest actuating system for two wheeled vehicles comprising of a lever&gt; cables and foot rest actuating mechanism, wherein the movement of lever located in the vicinity of rider actuates the actuating mechanism through cables to move the pillion footrest in extended position.<br>
5<br><br>
The invention will be best understood with the help of the following illustration explained with reference to the accompanying drawings with the Provisional Specification -<br>
Fig.l - illustrates top view of the vehicle showing typical pillion footrest position on chassis according to the prior art.<br>
Fig.2 - illustrates top view of the vehicle showing typical pillion footrests in extended and retracted positions according to the invention.<br>
Fig.3 - illustrates side view of the vehicle showing pillion footrest positions and details oftypical footrests actuating system according to the invention.<br>
Fig.4 - illustrates details oftypical pillion footrest actuating system according to the invention showing the elevation and plan view of the system.<br><br>
Fig.5 - illustrates details of fitment of operating lever of typical<br>
pillion footrest actuating system according to the invention.<br>
For the simplicity of explanation, the description given below is for actuating system related to the left-hand side footrest of the pillion. The right hand side footrest of the pillion is exactly mirror image of the left hand side pillion footrest and is identically actuated.<br>
A pillion footrest actuating system according to the present invention essentially comprises of a chassis (1), footrest (2) with lug (30), pivot pin (4), a lever (5), cables (11, 11a), bracket (14) for footrest (2), bracket assembly for release mechanism (6), torsion spring (7), compression spring (8), cable locking screw (9), release cam or dog (10), tube I (12), tube II (13), cable adjusting means (20), hex nut (16), washer (17) and cable mounting bracket (18), cable joint (19), pivot (21) and bracket (22) for lever (5).<br>
7<br><br>
Figure 1 illustrates a typical arrangement of footrests (2 and 3) when looking from the topside of the vehicle. The footrests (2 or 3) are pivotally mounted on bracket footrest mounting (14) welded to chassis (1) through rod or tube (13). The said footrest (2 or 3) is in retracted position when not in use. When the pillion user decides to use the pillion footrest (2 and 3) to rest or support legs, he uses his foot or hand to extend the footrest to extended position of footrests (2a and 3a) as shown by dotted lines. The said footrests are held in this position with the help of retaining means such as springs. This system of footrest is well known and does not need detailed explanation.<br>
Figures 2 to 5 illustrate typical arrangement of pillion footrest (2) and actuation system thereof according to the invention.<br>
According to the invention the said lever (5) is assembled to bracket (22)  for  lever (5) through  pivot (21) and is held in position by<br>
8<br><br>
conventional means (not shown). The said bracket (22) for the lever is welded to chassis (1) at a predetermined location. One end of the said cable (11) is connected to the operating end of lever (5) and the other end is connected to the cable joint (19) through cable adjusting means (20). The said cable joint (19) connects the cable (11) and one end of the cable (11a). The other end of the cable (11a) passes through cable adjusting means (20) assembled to bracket assembly (6) for release mechanism and is fixed to the release cam or dog (10) by cable locking screw (9). The bracket assembly (6) for release mechanism, which itself is a welded assembly of release cam housing (6a) and plate (31) for the spring is welded to chassis (1) through tube I (12). The release cam or dog (10) is slidably assembled to the release cam housing (6a). A compression spring (8) is provided between the said release cam or dog (10) and plate (31) for spring. Also welded to the said chassis (1) is tube II (13) which is welded with a bracket (14) forfootrest The said foot rest (2) is assembled to the<br>
9<br><br>
said bracket (14) for footrest (2) with the help of pivot pin (4), hex nut (16) and washer (17). A torsion spring (7) is assembled between said footrest (2) with lug (30) and bracket (14) for footrest (2) with its lugs resting on these parts.<br>
The footrest (2) with lug (30) is held in retracted position by lug (30) resting on spring loaded release cam or dog (10). The torsion spring (7) is used to provide release energy to the footrest (2) with lug (30). When the rider wishes to extend footrest (2), he actuates lever (5) located within the riders' reach at front of vehicle, which in turn operates cable (11). Cable (11) and cable (11a) compress the spring (8) and thus the lug (30) gets released from cam or dog (10) resulting in footrest (2) which is loaded with torsion spring (7) getting into extended position. Pushing the footrest (2) back to its retracted position, manually, will operate the release cam or dog (10). The cam (10) gets locked into lug (30) of footrest (2) and holds it in retracted position. Cable (11)  is a split cable<br>
10<br><br>
which can operate both footrest (LH) (2) and footrest RH (3) at the same time. Alternatively, any other arrangement like use of two separate cables operated by same lever (5) is possible as per the convenience and well within the scope of this invention.<br>
The description given above is for extending the pillion footrests by actuation of lever and the putting back to the retracted position is done manually. However, it is possible to make a system by which both extension and retraction of pillion footrests can be done by actuation of at least one control.<br>
The description given above is for lever actuated system. It is however possible to have a system in which the function of lever is carried out with other means, such as electrical solenoid and operating switch or other devices.<br>
The description above is for operating the pillion footrests both at left and right sides of the vehicle by a cable (11) and two branches thereof.<br>
11<br><br>
It is however possible to provide a system wherein either only left side or only right side pillion footrest can be operated depending upon need.<br>
The description stated above does not describe the exact locations of various spring-loaded cam/dog/arm, operating cable type and length, shape of footrest, design details of torsion spring. However, such locations, cable lengths, spring types and spring characteristics, footrest shape will depend upon the design and depend upon parameters, like the shape and configuration of the vehicle, angle of swiveling of footrest, location of footrest etc.<br>
The invention described hereinabove is only by way of an embodiment of an invention. The other embodiments or the modifications of the said invention which are within the knowledge of a person skilled in the art are also intended to be covered by the scope of the present invention.<br>
