				<td>Description<br>
Low-voltage power breaker having an electronic<br>
overcurrent release and tripping magnets<br>
The invention relates to a low-voltage power breaker<br>
having an electronic overcurrent release and having<br>
tripping magnets which, when the overcurrent release or<br>
a special signal causes the closed switching contacts<br>
to be released, trip a latch, the overcurrent release<br>
and the tripping magnets being fit together to form one<br>
protective module.<br>
A power breaker having these features has been<br>
disclosed in US 4,700,161. This power breaker has a<br>
known compact design having a molded case and a toggle<br>
lever drive (MCCB) . In order to make it possible to<br>
replace or refit modules of the tripping magnets,<br>
access can be gained to said tripping magnets via the<br>
front control panel of the power breaker once a cover<br>
has been removed. The electronic overcurrent release<br>
does not have its own control panel owing to the<br>
compact design of the power breaker. Another feature of<br>
the design of compact power breakers is the fact that<br>
the operator can detect a tripping procedure not by<br>
means of a special display element but by means of a<br>
specific position of the outer handle of the toggle<br>
lever drive. The resetting required for reconnection of<br>
the power breaker also takes place by means of the<br>
handle of the toggle lever drive.<br>
Electronic overcurrent releases and tripping magnets<br>
are correspondingly used in the same manner in low-<br>
voltage power breakers of open design (PCBs) which are<br>
distinguished from the design with the toggle lever<br>
drive by their suitability for higher rated currents<br>
and by their higher switching capacity as well as by a<br>
storage drive. The overcurrent releases of these power<br>
breakers also make it possible to set all the important<br>
parameters in order to be able to match the protective<br>
action of the power breaker, for example, to the<br>
properties of a load. For this purpose, the overcurrent<br>
releases are provided with their own front control<br>
panel which is included in the control panel of the<br>
power breaker and at which access can be gained to the<br>
setting elements. Resetting, following tripping, takes<br>
place in this case by means of a special element which<br>
is arranged in the vicinity of the front control panel<br>
of the overcurrent release (Catalog 3WN6, 1995, page 2,<br>
Siemens Publication E20002-K1801-B401-A1).<br>
The invention is based on the object, in a power<br>
breaker of the latter design, of accommodating tripping<br>
magnets in a space-saving manner and of arranging their<br>
display and reset elements on the front control panel<br>
of the power breaker such that they can be seen.<br>
This object is achieved according to the invention by<br>
the electronic overcurrent release having, in a manner<br>
known per se, a front control panel which is accessible<br>
via a control panel of the power breaker, and by the<br>
tripping magnets being fit to the overcurrent release<br>
on the side of a housing of the latter that is remote<br>
from the front control panel.<br>
Using an arrangement which is the opposite of that<br>
disclosed in OS 4,700,161, mentioned initially,<br>
tripping magnets underneath or behind the electronic<br>
overcurrent release - it is possible for the user to<br>
operate the electronic overcurrent release in the<br><br>
same manner whilst retaining the advantage of the<br>
combined<br>
design of the two assemblies. On the other hand, the<br>
display and operating elements of the tripping magnets<br>
are now part of the front control panel of the<br>
overcurrent release, which improves clarity and thus<br>
operational reliability. An important factor here is<br>
the fact that the combination of all of the tripping<br>
magnets provided to form a assembly fit to the<br>
overcurrent release accordingly also makes two, or even<br>
more, display and reset elements visible and accessible<br>
to the operator on the front control panel of the<br>
overcurrent release.<br>
The invention is explained in more detail below with<br>
reference to the exemplary embodiment shown in the<br>
figures.<br>
Figure 1 shows a side view of a protective module<br>
comprising an electronic overcurrent release and an<br>
assembly of tripping magnets.<br>
Figure 2 shows the upper part of a front control panel<br>
of the protective module shown in figure 1.<br>
The protective module 1 shown in figure 1 comprises an<br>
electronic overcurrent release 2, whose housing 3 is<br>
stepped such that tripping magnets 4 can be located<br>
wholly or partially in the step. The tripping magnets<br>
are combined in a known manner to form a magnet<br>
assembly. In particular, a tripping magnet, which can<br>
be activated by the overcurrent release 2, as well as<br>
an undervoltage release and an operating current<br>
release can be provided. These additional tripping<br>
magnets can be activated by dedicated circuits.<br>
However, it is possible, for example, to register the<br>
response of such additional tripping magnets in a<br>
memory module of the electronic overcurrent release 2.<br>
A special panel 6 for operating the tripping magnets is<br>
located on a front control panel 5 of the protective<br>
module 1 which is shown separately in figure 2, in<br>
section and from the front. In the example shown, a<br>
display element 7 and a reset element 8 for the<br>
tripping magnet 8 influenced by the overcurrent release<br>
are provided, and identical display and operating<br>
elements 9 and 10, respectively, for an operating<br>
current release which can be energized, for example,<br>
when a high breaking capacity fuse, which is connected<br>
in series with the power breaker, blows.<br>
The magnet assembly shown in figure 1 having the<br>
tripping magnets 4 may be fit with components as<br>
required, as is known per se, and may additionally have<br>
signalling switches 11 in order not only to be able to<br>
indicate response of the tripping magnets 4<br>
mechanically but also to be able to signal this<br>
electrically. The fact that the control panel 5<br>
protrudes slightly beyond the housing 3, and pins and<br>
plungers for display and resetting purposes can be<br>
arranged through said housing 3 from the magnet<br>
assembly, which also protrudes slightly beyond the<br>
housing 3, makes it possible for the tripping magnets 4<br>
arranged at the rear of the housing 3 to interact<br>
without problems with the display and reset elements<br>
located on the front control panel 5.<br>
If required, the display and reset elements of more<br>
than two tripping magnets 4 can also be arranged in the<br>
display panel 6. If, as indicated in figure 2, tripping<br>
magnets 4 are arranged next to one another, this makes<br>
it easier to accommodate the display and reset elements<br>
7, 9 and 8 and 10, respectively. The low-voltage power<br>
breaker, which is fit with the protective module, has<br>
not been shown specifically in the figures since it has<br>
a design which is known per<br>
se, for example according to the abovementioned Siemens<br>
document. The interaction of the tripping magnets 4<br>
with the latch elements in the breaker mechanism of the<br>
power breaker takes place in the same manner as for<br>
known power breakers.<br>
