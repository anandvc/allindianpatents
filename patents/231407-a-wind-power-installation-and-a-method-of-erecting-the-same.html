				<td>Now the object of the invention is to develop a method by means of which<br>
the erection of wind power install ations can be effected still more conveniently but<br>
in particular also more quickly.<br>
A further aim of the invention is to provide in particular a solution which is<br>
suitable for offshore wind power installations.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a wind power installation<br>
comprising: a foundation; a pylon which is based on a foundation and having a<br>
diameter in a foundation regionl a generator for providing electrical energy; a<br>
power module having a plurality of electrical devices and a support, wherein the<br>
plurality of electrical devices comprises at least one transformer for transforming<br>
electrical energy provided by the generator to a medium voltage or a high voltage,<br>
and at least one of a control unit for controlling the electrical energy provided by<br>
the generator, a supply unit for supplying the electrical energy provided by the<br>
generator and a converter unit for converting the electrical energy provided by the<br>
generator, wherein the support s placed on the foundation and accommodates the<br>
plurality of electrical devices, and wherein the power module has at least one of a<br>
width and a length less than the diameter of the pylon in the foundation region; and<br>
a container accommodating the power module, the container having a wall<br>
disposed between the wall of the pylon and the power module.<br>
The present invention also provides a method of erecting a wind power<br>
installation as claimed in claim 1, comprising the steps of: disposing the power<br>
module within a container, wherein the power module is mounted on the foundation<br>
prior to erection of the pylon; or wherein the power module is already fitted in the<br>
pylon at the factory upon manufacture of the pylon.<br>
In accordance with the nvention it is first proposed that the power module is<br>
arranged in a container having walls which are disposed between the wall of the<br>
pylon and the power module. Accordingly therefore the power module has its own<br>
enclosure or is disposed in a separate space within the pylon of the wind power<br>
installation. The particular advantage of that structure is that in that way, in a<br>
particular fashion in relation to	â€”<br><br>
offshore wind power instalations, it is possible to ensure that, when water<br>
penetrates into the pylon, the power module and the items of electrical<br>
equipment installed therein are not also detrimentally affected at the same<br>
time.<br>
If the transformer and the further parts of the power module such as<br>
switching installations, inverters and so forth are disposed in a separate<br>
space within the wind po ver installation, it is also relatively simple for<br>
those components to be separated from the rest of the ambient air within<br>
the pylon of the wind power installation. Under certain circumstances in a<br>
wind power installation that can be very important if it is operated as an<br>
offshore wind power installation and therefore a certain salt content in the<br>
air is not improbable. Enclosing the electrically sensitive parts in a housing<br>
means that in principle they can be protected from the salt-bearing internal<br>
air within the pylon of the wind power installation, for example by the<br>
enclosing housing and the power module also being provided with a<br>
personnel-negotiable lock arrangement. If cooling is necessary for the<br>
electrical parts within the enclosing housing, then the arrangement can<br>
have suitable cooling ducts which lead into the interior of the pylon and for<br>
example also extend along the pylon wall and through which air can be<br>
introduced here into the cool ng ducts (by way of a fan) and then passes in<br>
a cooled condition back into the enclosing housing again so that the same<br>
air is always circulated within the enclosing housing and that air does not<br>
involve the addition thereto of the air, which under some circumstances<br>
bears salt, in the rest of the interior of the pylon.<br>
The power module in the container, as a departure from the previous<br>
design structure of wind power installations, can already be placed on the<br>
foundation of the wind power installation after it has been set up, before<br>
the pylon is erected, or the container with the power module is already<br>
mounted and fixed within the pylon at the factory so that erection of the<br>
wind power installation is also possible without the electrical parts of the<br>
offshore wind power installations, which are sensitive to moisture and<br>
damp, being detrimentally affected when erecting those installations.<br><br>
The power modules ere as far as possible already prefabricated and<br>
mounted on carriers so that, using a crane which is required in any case for<br>
erecting a wind power instalation, the power modules can be placed on the<br>
pylon foundation or a platform and the entire system production procedure,<br>
in particular laying cables and the entire system preparation process for the<br>
wind power installation by adjusting control modules, setting up the<br>
switching cabinets etc can take place in a protected space and it is possible<br>
to begin those activities after the pylon has been erected.<br>
It is also particularly advantageous if the supports of the power<br>
modules and/or the containers for the power module have at their<br>
underside support feet which in turn rest on pre-positioned plates on the<br>
pylon foundation. Those plates are already let into and fixed in the<br>
foundation when the foundation is produced, at given positions, so that<br>
later establishment of the power modules can be effected in a very simple<br>
fashion.<br>
Finally it is also highly (advantageous if empty tubes are provided for<br>
the cables which extend out oF the wind power installation, that is to say in<br>
particular the power transmission cables, control cables and so forth.<br>
Empty tube tie bars are provided for those empty tubes in the foundation of<br>
a wind power installation or above the foundation and those empty tube tie<br>
bars fix the empty tubes in a defined position. For that purpose the tie bars<br>
are held by means of holding arms which in turn are again exactly<br>
predetermined in parts of the foundation or at the lower section of the<br>
cable feed arrangement and in particular are laid in such a way that the<br>
cables which extend out of the power module into the foundation have a<br>
standardised, shortest and optimum cable route.<br>
The measures according to the invention therefore also already<br>
facilitate the entire electrical setup of the wind power installation by<br>
prefabrication of individual modules or standardisation such as empty tube<br>
tie bars, power module support; etc, when establishing the foundation.<br>
The entire erection time of the wind power installation can be<br>
markedly reduced with the measures according to the invention. In<br>
addition, the costs for the entire wind power installation erection procedure<br><br>
can be reduced with the invention without having to accept any technical<br>
disadvantages.<br>
The invention is described in greater detail hereinafter by means of<br>
an embodiment illustrated in a drawing.<br>
Figure 1 shows a plan view of a pre-established foundation (without<br>
concrete filling) with a steel reinforcement 1 and 2, on an empty tube 3<br>
which is held by way of a strut arrangement to a lowermost pylon section<br>
which adjoins the reinforcement. The Figure also shows support plates 5<br>
which are mounted for holding arms in the lowermost section of the pylon<br>
(for the major part they and no longer to be seen at a later time after<br>
erection of the wind power installation).<br>
The empty tube 3 serves later for receiving cables, for example the<br>
power cables, by way of which all the electrical energy from the wind power<br>
installation is taken to the network by way of underground cables. For that<br>
purpose there is often not just a single tube but a plurality of tubes.<br>
Figure 2 shows the foundation section after filling with the concrete.<br>
It is to be seen in that respect that the empty tubes remain in their pre-<br>
fixed position and the support plates are also concreted into position, in<br>
which respect, in the concret ng operation, care is to be taken to ensure<br>
that the support plates rest fully on the structural concrete and thus ensure<br>
that the load is carried over an area. The concrete extends to the upper<br>
edge of the support plates and is carefully joined to the plate edges.<br>
After the concrete has set the holding arms for holding the support<br>
plates and also the tie bars for fixing the empty tubes can be dismantled<br>
and re-used for erecting further installations.<br>
After the concrete has set, for further erection of the wind power<br>
installation, the pylon is not placed on the foundation section - as has<br>
hitherto been usual - but firstly the power module according to the<br>
invention is placed on the support plates.<br>
Such a power module 7 is shown in Figure 3 in a two-part<br>
configuration, still without its enclosing housing, in which respect the power<br>
module can also comprise further parts.<br><br>
The two parts of the power module 7 are placed one above the other<br>
in the illustrated embodiment and the entire power module comprises two<br>
mutually superposed supports 8 which in turn again receive essential parts<br>
of the power modules, that is to say for example the transformer, inverter,<br>
switching cabinets, medium voltage installation and so forth.<br>
The mutually superposed supports are constructed in the manner of<br>
a frame and fit exactly one above the other so that reliable fixing relative to<br>
each other is also guaranteed.<br>
The individual supports have inter alia four vertically oriented beam<br>
members - defining a rectangle - which are connected together. Those<br>
beam members are screwed together at their underside and top side.<br>
After the electrical power module has been set up on the foundation<br>
the pylon is erected and in that situation is fitted over the power module.<br>
For that purpose the outside dimensions of the power module in terms of<br>
breadth and length are less than the inside diameter of the pylon in the<br>
lower pylon region/foundation region.<br>
After the pylon has been erected the wind power installation is<br>
equipped as usual with the machine housing, the rotor is mounted in place<br>
and suitable electrical connections are made between the generator and the<br>
power module for bringing the installation into operation and the power<br>
module is connected (outpu: of the transformer) to the power supply<br>
network.<br>
When the above-described empty tubes or devices provided for<br>
carrying cables are pre-fixed in given prescribed positions, the connection<br>
between the power module and the network can also be made extremely<br>
quickly and advantageously, in which respect the cable lengths overall are<br>
optimised because the empty tubes are positioned and thus the cables<br>
issue from the foundation, at the location where they are required in the<br>
case of a standardised, optim sed structural configuration for connection to<br>
the corresponding parts of the power module.<br>
In the case of the wind power installation according to the invention<br>
it is advantageous if access to the wind power installation is no longer<br>
necessarily through a conventional door in the fixed foundation region but<br><br>
through a door (access) which is so positioned that it opens into the region<br>
above the parts of the power module, which are carrying high or medium<br>
voltage. For that purpose a suitable ladder or staircase can be provided at<br>
the outside of the pylon. That positioning of the access door has the<br>
advantage that the personnel who must relatively frequently enter the<br>
installation do not always have to move past the parts of the power<br>
module, which are carrying /oltages, while the installation is in operation.<br>
That also ensures that no one is in the immediately proximity of the power<br>
module unexpectedly or by mistake while the wind power installation is in<br>
operation, and thus comes into contact with voltage-carrying or current-<br>
carrying parts, which could cause a serious accident.<br>
Then, provided in the region of the pylon access door is a suitable<br>
intermediate platform which the personnel entering the pylon can negotiate<br>
in order then to climb further up in the wind power installation in the<br>
interior of the pylon or to carry out adjustments at various control devices<br>
or also read off measurement data.<br>
A wind power installaton of the type according to the invention<br>
involves such an installation which usually has more than 100 kW rated<br>
power, preferably a rated power in the region of 500 kW, 1 MW, 1.5 MW or<br>
markedly higher. Preferably the intermediate platform is provided with a<br>
closable panel through which the personnel can climb into the lower region<br>
of the power module. Closure of the flap ensures that the lower part of the<br>
power module is further safeguarded against unauthorised access or entry.<br>
In that case the inside diameter of the pylon in the foundation region<br>
can be several metres so that the entire area there is for example 100 m2<br>
or more and therefore there is a sufficiently large area for receiving the<br>
power modules. Insofar as the term 'power module' is used in this<br>
application, that means in particular the converter and network transfer<br>
region of the wind power installation. These are in particular the assemblies<br>
such as the transformer or inverter or emergency switches as well as the<br>
medium voltage switching cabinet or also the distributors.<br>
As mentioned the power module is to be disposed in its own<br>
container or space within the wind power installation. That container can<br><br>
comprise a cylindrical tube when, after the power module has been placed<br>
on the foundation, is fitted over the entire power module or the power<br>
module is already disposed at the factory within the cylindrical tube so that,<br>
for transporting the cylindrical tube, the entire power module is<br>
transported. The container can in particular also be very substantially<br>
closed towards all sides but it is provided with at least one access door and,<br>
if the power module is constructed on a plurality of levels within the tube, it<br>
is also possible for the various levels of the power module to be reached by<br>
way of stairways or ladders within the module.<br>
It is also possible to provide within the container an additional space<br>
or room which is available for example as a changing room and/or rest<br>
room for people such as service engineers and so forth. That is highly<br>
appropriate in particular when the invention is embodied in relation to<br>
offshore wind power installations and in a bad weather situation the<br>
engineers are obliged to remain within the wind power installation for a<br>
certain time. That room or space should therefore also be provided with the<br>
most necessary items which permit a prolonged stay such as for example<br>
fresh water, food, sleeping arrangements, communication equipment.<br>
In addition that space or room can perform a lock arrangement<br>
function and can be hermetically sealable in relation to the interior of the<br>
wind power installation. In that way for example in the case of a fire in the<br>
wind power installation people can take: refuge there and arrange for and<br>
await their rescue.<br>
If the enclosing housing comprises a cylindrical tube, the upper and<br>
lower tube ends or further additional openings which are possibly provided<br>
can be closed for transport to the building site or the upper and lower tube<br>
ends are fixedly closed from the outset: so that, even in severe weather,<br>
transport to the building site or an interruption in the building activity does<br>
not entail the risk of sea water or moisture being able to penetrate into the<br>
container and thus reach the electrically sensitive parts of the power<br>
module.<br>
If cooling of the power on odule elements is necessary, the container<br>
is also so designed that air exchange between the interior of the power<br><br>
module and the interior of the pylon of the wind power installation is<br>
possible. Preferably however only heat dissipation of the waste heat from<br>
the power module to the interior of the pylon can occur outside the power<br>
module. For that purpose, it is possible to provide a closed air circuit for the<br>
power module, which delivers the heat to the interior of the pylon by way<br>
of a suitable heat exchanger, for example in the form of a cooling coil.<br>
If cooling of the individual elements of the power module is<br>
necessary that can also be effected by air being passed from the interior of<br>
the enclosing housing by way of air ducts 12 - Figure 7 - (air shafts) which<br>
on the one hand open into the enclosing housing, and by those air shafts<br>
again returning the cooled air back into the enclosing housing at another<br>
location. Positive convection of the air within the enclosing housing is to be<br>
established by fans at the entry and/or exit of the individual air shafts. If<br>
those air ducts (air shafts) are passed directly at the pylon of the wind<br>
power installation in contact therewith, for example also being in a spiral<br>
configuration in a plurality of layers in mutually superposed relationship,<br>
then the air is cooled within the air ducts because the pylon wall itself<br>
forms a cooling element which always has air or water flowing around it<br>
from the exterior. The above-mentioned variant has the particular<br>
advantage that the interior of the enclosing housing is then always<br>
separated from the interior of the pylon and, if the wind power installation<br>
is an offshore wind power installation, then the interior of the enclosing<br>
housing is very certain to be protected from coming into contact with<br>
possibly salt-bearing air which has penetrated into the interior of the pylon.<br>
This means that all electrical parts of the power module in the interior of<br>
the enclosing housing are protected from contact with air which has a very<br>
strong attacking effect such as salt-bearing air without measures being<br>
absolutely necessary for simultaneously protecting the entire interior of the<br>
pylon from the ingress of salt-bearing air.<br>
In the case of a closed enclosing housing for the transformer and the<br>
other electronic elements, it is appropriate also to dispose within the<br>
enclosing housing a fire protection arrangement which is activated when a<br>
fire breaks out there. That fire protection arrangement can for example also<br><br>
provide that the entire arrangement is flooded with an inert gas, for<br>
example CO2, so that the ox/gen content within the enclosing housing is<br>
reduced and thus a possible fire is deprived of the necessary oxygen.<br>
Instead of a gas such as CO2 however it is also possible to use a gas such<br>
as nitrogen or another inert gas. That inert gas is stored in a tank and is<br>
supplied by way of one or more sensors which respond in a fire situation<br>
(or at a greatly increased temperature), by way of a valve which closes the<br>
tank with the inert gas so that the inert gas can flow very rapidly into the<br>
enclosing housing.<br>
Under some circumstances safety devices are provided, for<br>
preventing the inert gas being capable of flowing into the enclosing housing<br>
when people are disposed therein. Such a safety device can also include for<br>
example switching elements which are activated on the part of the<br>
operating personnel when entering the enclosing housing so that then the<br>
inert gases are prevented from flowing into the enclosing housing.<br>
In the event that nonetheless salt-bearing air should pass into the<br>
enclosing housing, it is also advantageous if there are means within the<br>
enclosing housing, for removing salt from the air which is present there.<br>
So that as little salt-bearing air as possible can pass into the<br>
enclosing housing, it is also advantageous if the enclosing housing is<br>
provided with a lock arrangement which is preferably made from a glass<br>
fibre reinforced plastic material (GRP). If the operating personnel want to<br>
enter the enclosing housing by way of the lock arrangement, air is passed<br>
under pressure into the lock irrangement so that the operating personnel<br>
can pass into the enclosing housing against an air flow. It is therefore<br>
advantageous if the enclosing housing is also connected to a further tank,<br>
within which substantially salt-free air is stored which is then passed into<br>
the enclosing housing under pressure when operating personnel wish to go<br>
into the enclosing housing by way of the lock arrangement.<br>
It is also advantageous if there are within the enclosing housing<br>
means which are so adapted as to minimise the moisture content within the<br>
enclosing housing. Such a means can be for example a Peltier element.<br><br>
The means for removing salt from the air and also for reducing the<br>
moisture content are possibly activated if corresponding sensors which are<br>
responsive to the salt content in the air or the moisture content detect that<br>
a given salt value or moisture content value is exceeded. The means for<br>
removing salt from the air ard also for reducing the moisture content are<br>
then activated until the salt content and/or the moisture content has fallen<br>
below a predetermined value.<br>
The enclosing housing with the power module enclosed therein can<br>
be placed on the foundation of the wind power installation or on a platform<br>
within the pylon of the wind power installation. That platform can<br>
preferably also be disposed very far up just under the machine housing of<br>
the wind power installation in order in that fashion to ensure in the best<br>
possible way that as little salt as possible can pass into the enclosing<br>
housing, in the case of a wind powe' installation which is set up as an<br>
offshore installation.<br>
It is also advantageous if the data which the sensors for the salt<br>
content and/or the moisture content measure are forwarded to a central<br>
station in which the entire wind power installation is controlled or<br>
monitored. The means for reducing the salt content or for reducing the<br>
moisture content within the enclosing housing can be activated by way of<br>
the central station.<br>
To prevent the outbreak of a fire in relation to parts of the power<br>
module, it is also possible for an atmosphere with a low oxygen content to<br>
prevail within the entire enclosing housing, during normal operation. That<br>
can be effected for example by oxygen being removed from the air within<br>
the enclosing housing so that the oxygen content falls below the normal<br>
oxygen content of air. It will be appreciated that it is also possible for a<br>
high CO2 content (up to 100%) or nitrogen content (up to 100%) or of<br>
another inert gas (from a tank) to be provided in the entire enclosing<br>
housing. It is only when the operating personnel wish to enter the enclosing<br>
housing that then a normal atmosphere is restored within the enclosing<br>
housing so that it is possible to stay therein. In such a case it is appropriate<br>
if the lock arrangement is to be opened only when an atmosphere which<br><br>
permits a person to stay within the enclosing housing without breathing<br>
equipment is produced within the enclosing housing.<br>
The enclosing housing according to the invention can be disposed not<br>
only within the wind power installation but also mounted to the pylon<br>
directly on the outside thereof. That can be effected for example by the<br>
entire enclosing housing being mounted on a platform externally on the<br>
pylon or fixed directly to the pylon. If the enclosing housing is in the form<br>
of a closed tube and if that tube is arranged externally on the pylon then<br>
people can enter the enclosing housing by way of a door or lock<br>
arrangement to the enclosng housing and the interior of the pylon. With<br>
this variant it is also readily possible for the interior of the enclosing<br>
housing to be cooled by way of air ducts which extend into or surround the<br>
pylon, without the outside air which surrounds the wind power installation<br>
coming into contact with the air within the enclosing housing.<br>
It is also advantageous if the enclosing housing is of a multi-part<br>
configuration so that for example when replacing an individual part of the<br>
power module it is not necessary to remove the entire enclosing housing<br>
but only the module part or the enclosing housing, which directly surrounds<br>
the part of the power module that has to be replaced.<br>
Figure 5 shows a sice view of a wind power installation 12 according<br>
to the invention with a py on 9. Figure 6 shows a section taken along line<br>
A-A in Figure 5. In this respect it can be seen from Figure 6 that an<br>
enclosing housing 10 is diposed between the power module 10 and the<br>
pylon wall, which housing 10 can also be a tube.<br>
Figure 7 shows a view in longitudinal section through the pylon<br>
region. It can be seen in this respect that once again the enclosing housing<br>
10 completely screens the power module 7 from the pylon wall 9. For<br>
cooling the power module, the air within the enclosing housing is caused to<br>
flow by way of a fan 11 into an air cooling duct 12 and that air duct 12 is in<br>
part mounted directly to the pylon wall 9 so that in particular there the<br>
heated air can be cooled down and can then flow back again into the<br>
enclosing housing 10. It is apparent that the air cooling ducts can assume<br>
any shape and in particular can also be passed in a spiral configuration<br><br>
along the pylon wall 9 in order in that way to provide for optimum cooling<br>
of the air within the air duct 12.<br>
Figure 8 shows a cut-away view of a wind power installation<br>
according to the invention, from which it can be seen that various parts of<br>
the wind power installation are disposed on different levels within an<br>
enclosing housing.<br>
Figure 9 shows a party cut-away plan view of one of the levels<br>
shown in Figure 8. Figure 9 shows a plan view (in partly cut-away form) on<br>
to the entry level (third level) at which there are disposed a control cabinet,<br>
a control desk, a DUV desk an j so forth. The floor panels laid there can be<br>
removed in order to convey parts which are below that level into the third<br>
level and thus also into the entry and exit level. Under some circumstances<br>
that is important when for example a part has to be moved up from the<br>
first and second level to the third level by means of a crane in order then to<br>
be conveyed outwardly by way of the entrance of the wind power<br>
installation.<br>
Figure 11 shows a partly cut-away view of a power cabinet level.<br>
Such power cabinet levels can also be provided at a plurality of levels, for<br>
example at the 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th levels, because, in the case of<br>
relatively large installations, a plurality of power cabinets are usually<br>
required and under some circumstances not all of them can be disposed in<br>
one level. In that respect it is aIso to be noted that provided at each level<br>
are wall openings for used air so that used air can be discharged through<br>
collecting ducts and can be passed into the pylon of the wind power<br>
installation where the air is then cooled by heat exchange with the pylon<br>
wall.<br>
If the enclosing housing is closed it is also possible for the air<br>
pressure within the enclosing housing to be different from the air pressure<br>
outside that housing and in particular also the air pressure outside the<br>
enclosing housing but within the pylon.<br>
Finally it can also be provided that a heating and/or cooling device is<br>
disposed within the enclosing ho using and/or in one of the air ducts so that<br>
it is possible to influence the temperature within the enclosing housing. A<br><br>
heating device is approprate under some circumstances when the<br>
installation - for whatever reasons - has stopped for a prolonged period of<br>
time and in winter cools down to temperatures which are undesirable. On<br>
the other hand, cooling of the air within the enclosing housing can be very<br>
effectively and quickly effected with a cooling device (for example a heat<br>
exchanger).<br>
Finally it is advantageous if the entire enclosing housing is in the<br>
form of a self-supporting arrangement so that the entire enclosing housing<br>
can be transported and in particular moved on a crane, with the devices<br>
disposed in the enclosing housing. Particularly if the enclosing housing is a<br>
tube (for example of steel), such a des;ign configuration is readily possible.<br>
The advantage of that design configuration is in particular that then the<br>
entire enclosing housing, together with all parts therein, can be produced at<br>
the factory and thus with the highest level of quality and then only still<br>
remains to be transported to the location at which it is to be erected.<br>
The above-indicated structure can also considerably facilitate<br>
possible later dismantling.<br>
Figures 12 to 16 show further details of a wind power installation<br>
according to the invention with the power module already described above.<br>
In this respect the description explains in particular how a lock<br>
arrangement is provided between the external entrance to the pylon of the<br>
wind power installation and the interior of the installation, that is to say<br>
where the important electronic and electrical parts of the power module are<br>
disposed, which lock arrangement, in the situation where the entire wind<br>
power installation is used as an offshore wind power installation, prevents<br>
salt-bearing air or salt water from being capable of passing into the interior<br>
of the installation and thus damaging or destroying electrical or electronic<br>
parts.<br>
Figure 15 shows in a partial longitudinal section of the lower pylon,<br>
various levels to which the power module is distributed under certain<br>
circumstances and, at top right n Figure 15, the external entrance to the<br>
interior of the pylon. That entrance is usually a gate or door which is<br>
respectively closable. As can already be seen from Figure 15, a platform<br><br>
101 extends from that door 100 inwardly substantially perpendicularly to<br>
the pylon wall, the platform .01 preferably being connected directly to the<br>
pylon so that the platform am already be walked upon when the pylon is<br>
set up.<br>
Figure 16 shows a view from above of the structure shown in Figure<br>
15, illustrating the tube module 7 as well as the door 100 and the platform<br>
101.	Laterally in relation to the platform there are further platforms,<br>
preferably gratings, which are also fixedly mounted to the pylon wall and<br>
which make it possible for a person to go to the ladder 103 provided in the<br>
pylon, through the door 100, by way of the above-described platforms 101,<br>
102,	when already at a very early stage after construction of the wind<br>
power installation.<br>
As can also be seen from the plan view but also from Figure 15,<br>
disposed directly adjoining the platform 101 towards the interior of the<br>
pylon is a space (see also in :his respect Figure 10, the bottom right part<br>
thereof) which possibly together with tne space which is above the platform<br>
101 forms a closed lock arrangement. The area of that lock space is shown<br>
by hatching in Figure 16.<br>
Operating personnel pass into that lock space from the exterior and<br>
in that space can possibly change clothing or at least stay for a short time.<br>
Sanitary equipment is also provided therein. In that lock space there is a<br>
further door 104 which leads to the interior of the pylon, that is to say to<br>
the items of equipment of the power module.<br>
That door 104 is preferably moisture-tight so that when under some<br>
circumstances moisture passes into the lock space, it cannot penetrate into<br>
the interior of the installation through the door 104.<br>
Figure 12 shows a view from the exterior on to the entrance door<br>
100 of the wind power installaton.<br>
Figure 13 shows once again a portion on an enlarged scale viewing<br>
into the lock entrance space of Figure 16.<br>
Figure 14 shows a further detail view from Figure 15. It can be<br>
clearly seen therein that the floor of the lock entrance space is fixed to the<br>
pylon interior itself and that floor is preferably moisture-transmitting so<br><br>
that, when spray water or the like passes into the lock entrance space<br>
when the entrance door 100 is opened, the spray water or the like can flow<br>
away through the floor. Provided beneath the floor which is preferably also<br>
in the form of a grating is a water-impervious panel which is inclined<br>
outwardly towards the pylon wall. If therefore spray water or also moisture<br>
from the clothing of the operating personnel drips off into that space<br>
through the grating, that water can flow away directly outwardly again<br>
through an opening 105.<br>
As can also be seen from Figure 16 but also Figures 14 and 13 the<br>
lock entrance space 101 can be closable by a further door 106. That door<br>
which is preferably also moisture-tight and water-tight separates the lock<br>
entrance space in relation :o the lock central space with the sanitary<br>
equipment which has already been described above.<br><br>
