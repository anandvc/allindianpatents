COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS FOR USE IN UROLOGICAL PROCEDURES<br>
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
The present application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application<br>
No. 60/683,488, filed May 20, 2005.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions for administration to<br>
the urinary tract during urological diagnostic, interventional, surgical and other medical<br>
procedures and for therapeutic treatment of urologic structures.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Many urological procedures are now performed using minimally invasive<br>
endoscopic (e.g., cystoscopic or uteroscopic) techniques. These include examination of<br>
the urethra, bladder and ureters, therapeutic treatments for benign prostatic hypertrophy,<br>
removal or fragmentation of kidney and bladder stones, the placement of urethral or<br>
ureteral stents to facilitate the passage of stones, the performance of biopsies and the<br>
excision of tumors. While less invasive than open surgery, these techniques involve<br>
procedural irritation and trauma to the urinary tract leading to pain, inflammation and<br>
smooth muscle spasm. Postoperative lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) following<br>
urological procedures often include pain, hyperreflexia (unstable bladder contractions),<br>
urinary frequency, nocturia and urgency, and in some cases urinary retention requiring<br>
prolonged catheterization.<br>
For some surgical procedures, such as transurethral resection of the prostate<br>
(TURP), frequent urination and other symptoms resulting, from the procedural irritation<br>
and inflammation may continue for a prolonged period, gradually resolving during the<br>
first six postoperative weeks. For urologic procedures employing a laser, postoperative<br>
complications such as inflammation and muscle spasm may continue for several weeks.<br>
Patients are frequently prescribed oral anticholinergic medication to inhibit postoperative<br>
PH.1.0050.PCT.AP 03.17.06<br>
3/17/2006 3:58:27 PM	1<br><br>
spasm and reduce the severity of unstable contractions. However, not all patients respond<br>
adequately to these drugs, and side effects may lead to discontinuation of these<br>
medications.<br>
Urological procedures are often performed with concurrent irrigation of the<br>
urinary tract, to remove blood and tissue debris so that a clear endoscopic field of view is<br>
maintained. Conventional irrigation solutions include saline, lactated Ringer's, glycine,<br>
sorbitol, manitol and sorbitol/manitol. These conventional irrigation solutions do not<br>
contain active pharmaceutical agents.<br>
US Patent 5,858,017 to Demopulos, et al, the disclosure of which is hereby<br>
incorporated by reference, discloses surgical irrigation solutions and methods for the<br>
inhibition of pain, inflammation and/or spasm. The use of irrigation solutions containing<br>
pain/inflamation inhibitors and anti-spasm agents during urological procedures in general<br>
and during TURP specifically is disclosed, including five-drug and nine-drug<br>
combinations. This reference does not teach optimized pairings of a pain/inflammation<br>
inhibitory agent with an anti-spasm agent for given urological procedures.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present invention provides methods and compositions for inhibiting pain,<br>
inflammation and/or spasm during urological procedures by locally delivering such<br>
compositions to structures of the urological tract during the procedure. The compositions<br>
include at least one agent that is a pain/inflammation inhibitory agent or a spasm<br>
-5-<br>
PH.1.0050.PCT.AP 03.17.06<br>
3/17/2006 3:58:27 PM<br><br>
inhibitory agent, or that acts to inhibit both pain/inflammation and spasm. Preferably, the<br>
compositions and methods of the present invention include two or more<br>
pain/inflammation inhibitory or spasm inhibitory agents that act on different molecular<br>
targets (i.e., enzymes, receptors or ion channels) or that act through different mechanisms<br>
of action. More preferably, the compositions of the present invention include at least one<br>
pain/inflammation inhibitory agent and at least one spasm inhibitory agent.<br>
As used herein, the term "pain/inflammation inhibitory agent" includes analgesic<br>
agents (i.e., antinociceptive agents), non-steroidal agents that inhibit inflammation<br>
[including both "non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs" (i.e., NSAIDS or cyclooxygenase<br>
inhibitors) and other agents that are not steroidal that act to inhibit inflammation],<br>
corticosteroids and local anesthetics.<br>
As used herein, the term "spasm inhibitory agent" includes agents that inhibit<br>
spasm or contraction of smooth muscle tissue and agents that inhibit spasm or contraction<br>
of other muscle tissue associated with the urinary tract (e.g., prostatic muscle tissue).<br>
Another aspect of the present invention is directed to the periprocedural delivery<br>
to the urinary tract of a cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor, suitably a non-selective COX-<br>
1/C0X-2 inhibitor, preferably a non-selective COX-1/COX-2 inhibitor that is a propionic<br>
acid derivative, more preferably ketoprofen, alone or with at least one additional agent<br>
that inhibits pain/inflammation and/or that inhibits spasm, such as a calcium channel<br>
antagonist.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention is directed to the periprocedural delivery<br>
to the urinary tract of a calcium channel antagonist (i.e., a calcium channel blocker),<br>
suitably an L-type calcium antagonist, preferably a dihydropyridine calcium channel<br>
antagonist, more preferably nifedipine, alone or with at least one additional agent that<br>
inhibits pain/inflammation and/or that inhibits spasm, such as a COX inhibitor.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention is directed to the periprocedural delivery<br>
to the urinary tract of a combination of a COX inhibitor and a calcium channel antagonist,<br>
preferably a non-selective COX-1/COX-2 inhibitor in combination with an L-type<br>
calcium antagonist, more preferably ketoprofen in combination with nifedipine.<br>
Ketoprofen and nifedipine have been found by the present inventors to provide greater<br>
than additive or synergistic results in the inhibition of bladder spasm, as described in the<br>
examples below.<br>
One aspect of the present invention entails the local delivery of the compositions<br>
of the present invention to the bladder, ureter, urethra, or other urinary tract structures to<br>
inhibit pain, inflammation and/or smooth muscle spasm during urological therapeutic,<br>
diagnostic, interventional, surgical and other medical procedures.<br>
-6-<br>
PH.1.0050.PCT.AP 03.17.06<br>
3/17/2006 3:58:27 PM<br><br>
As used herein, the terms "urinary tract" and "urinary sytem" refer to the kidneys,<br>
ureters, bladder, urethra and associated nerves, blood vessels and muscles. The term<br>
"lower urinary tract" refers to the bladder and urethra and associated nerves, blood vessels<br>
and muscles.<br>
A further aspect of the present invention entails the local delivery of the<br>
compositions of the present invention to urinary tract structures to reduce postoperative<br>
irritative voiding symptoms (e.g., void frequency, nocturia, urgency), pain and/or other<br>
lower urinary tract symptoms following such urological procedures.<br>
A further aspect of the present invention entails the local delivery of the<br>
compositions of the present invention to urinary tract structures to improve postoperative<br>
urinary function (e.g., decrease undesirable urinary retention) following such urological<br>
procedures.<br>
The compositions of the present invention are suitably delivered to the urinary<br>
tract before, during and/or after urological procedures, i.e., before (pre-) procedurally,<br>
during (intra-) procedurally, after (post-) procedurally, pre- and intraprocedurally, pre-<br>
and postprocedurally, intra- and postprocedurally or pre-, intra- and postprocedurally.<br>
Preferably, the compositions of the present invention are locally delivered to the<br>
urinary tract "periprocedurally", which as used herein means intraprocedurally, pre- and<br>
intraprocedurally, intra- and postprocedurally or pre-, intra- and postprocedurally.<br>
Periprocedural delivery may be either continuous or intermittent during the procedure.<br>
Preferably, the compositions of the present invention are delivered "continuously" during<br>
the procedure, which as used herein means delivery so as to maintain an approximately<br>
constant concentration of active agent(s) at the local delivery site. When delivered<br>
periprocedurally during a surgical procedure, the term "perioperatively" may be used<br>
interchangeably with periprocedurally herein. Preferably, the compositions of the present<br>
invention are delivered periprocedurely during the period of time when surgical or other<br>
procedural trauma and irritation is being incurred by urinary tract tissue.<br>
"Local" delivery of the compositions of the present invention to the urinary tract<br>
as used herein refers to deliver}' of the compositions directly to one or more structures of<br>
the urinary tract. The therapeutic agent(s) contained in the locally delivered compositions<br>
are not subject to first and/or second pass metabolism before reaching the local site of<br>
intended therapeutic (e.g., inhibitory) effect, in contrast to systemically delivered drugs.<br>
Pathophysiologic Effects of Urological Procedures<br>
The trauma of urological procedures results in an acute, localized inflammatory<br>
response in the associated urological structures. Inflammation is associated with a<br>
complex pattern of biochemical and cellular processes occurring at the local site,<br>
involving positive-feedback interactions between the peripheral nervous system, immune<br>
-7-<br>
PH.1.0050.PCT.AP 03.17.06<br>
3/17/2006 3:58:27 PM<br><br>
cells, the local vasculature and the central nervous system. The inflammatory response to<br>
procedural trauma in the urinary tract includes cytokine release, inflammatory cell<br>
migration, edema, pain and hyperalgesia.<br>
In response to tissue injury, numerous local mediators are rapidly released, which<br>
result in nociceptive stimulation of sensory C-fibers. The inflammatory response<br>
triggered by peripheral injury shows that, in addition to cytokines, small G-protein<br>
receptor-linked inflammatory mediators also modulate the rapid pathophysiological<br>
response of the bladder and urethra. In models of urinary bladder inflammation,<br>
bradykinin, histamine, substance P (SP), leukotrienes and prostaglandins have been found<br>
to be released from the bladder. Lecci, A., et al., Pharmacological Analysis of the Local<br>
and Reflex Responses to Bradykinin on Rat Urinary Bladder Motility in Vivo, Br. J.<br>
Pharmacol., 114:708-14 (1995); Lecci, A., et al., Capsaicin Pretreatment Does Not Alter<br>
Rat Urinary Bladder Motor Responses Induced by a Kinin B1 Receptor Agonist After<br>
Endotoxin Treatment, Neurosci. Lett. 262:73-76 (1999); Vasko, M., et al., Prostaglandin<br>
E2 Enhances Bradykinin-Stimulated Release of Neuropeptides from Rat Sensory Neurons<br>
in Culture, J Neurosci. 14:4987-97 (1994). Certain inflammatory mediators, such as<br>
prostaglandins and kinins, activate and sensitize C-fibers through interaction with specific<br>
receptors on nerve terminals. Other inflammatory mediators that have been described in<br>
the lower urinary tract include tachykinins and ATP (from C-fibers) (Maggi, C, et al.,<br>
Tachkykinin Antagonists and Capsaicin-Induced Contraction of the Rat Isolated Urinay<br>
Bladder: Evidence for Tachykinin-Mediated Cotransmission, Br. J. Pharmacol. 103:1535-<br>
41 (1991), CGRP (from C-fibers), serotonin (from mast cells and platelets), and<br>
endothelin. Maggi, C, et al., Contractile Responses of the Human Urinary Bladder,<br>
Renal Pelvis and Renal Artery to Endothelins and Sarafotoxin S6b, Gen. Pharmacol.<br>
21:247-49 (1990). These mediators operate together in a synergistic manner to increase<br>
postsurgical hyperalgesia, inflammation and muscle spasm. The number of mediators<br>
involved in the response underscores the multifactorial origin of the pain and<br>
inflammation process.<br>
The immediate activation of the sensory nerves (primary hyperalgesia) triggers a<br>
cascade of processes that involves alterations in the local vasculature, and influences<br>
muscle contractility. Capsaicin-sensitive afferent fiber stimulation elicits a local efferent<br>
response, which is characterized by release of neuropeptides (tachykinins and CGRP)<br>
from nerve endings. This release produces a number of local responses, which are part of<br>
the pathophysiological effects in the lower urinary tract. These include: (1) direct effects<br>
of released neurotransmitters on smooth muscle contraction; (2) changes in microvascular<br>
permeability resulting in plasma extravasation and edema of the bladder, urethra and<br>
prostate; (3) infiltration of immune cells; and (4) sensitization of nociceptors (secondary<br>
-8-<br>
PH.1.0050.PCT.AP 03.17.06<br>

hyperalgesia) resulting in increased pain. The consequences of these processes can affect<br>
normal bladder capacity and frequency of micturition, and often result in hypersensitivity,<br>
pain and smooth muscle spasm.<br>
The pathophysiologic response to procedural trauma of the urinary tract involves a<br>
complex cascade of molecular signaling and biochemical changes resulting in<br>
inflammation, pain, spasm and lower urinary tract symptoms. These are preferably<br>
addressed in accordance with the methods and compositions of the present invention by<br>
locally and periprocedurally delivering a combination of pharmacologic agents acting on<br>
multiple molecular targets to inhibit pain, inflammation and/or spasm. Preferred agents<br>
include cyclooxygenase inhibitors and calcium channel antagonists, more preferably in<br>
combination.<br>
Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors<br>
Prostaglandins are produced throughout the lower urinary tract and play a role in<br>
neurotransmission, bladder contractility and inflammatory responses. Human bladder<br>
mucosa has been found to contain several types of prostaglandins, which have been<br>
shown to contract the human detrusor. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is a potent mediator of<br>
pain and edema, and the exogenous administration of PGE2 induces contractile responses<br>
in inflamed bladders. Intravesical PGE2 produces both urgency and involuntary bladder<br>
contractions. Lepor, H., The Pathophysiology of Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms in the<br>
Ageing Male Population, Br. J Urol., 81 Suppl 1:29-33 (1998); Maggi, C, et al.,<br>
Prostanoids Modulate Reflex Micturition by Acting Through Capsaicin-Sensitive<br>
Afferents, Eur. J. Pharmacol. 145: 105-12 (1988). PGE2 given intravesically may<br>
stimulate micturition by releasing tachykinins from nerves in and/or immediately below<br>
the urothelium. Ishizuka, O., et al., Prostaglandin E2-Induced Bladder Hyperactivity in<br>
Normal, Conscious Rats: Involvement of Tachykinins?, J Urol. 153:2034-38 (1995).<br>
Prostanoids may, via release of tachykinins, contribute to both urge and bladder<br>
hyperactivity seen in inflammatory conditions of the lower urinary tract. While not<br>
wishing to be limited by theory, these actions are most likely mediated through activation<br>
of specific prostanoid receptor subtypes (EP1R) located on C-fibers and on bladder<br>
smooth muscle (FIGURE 1).<br>
In the inflamed bladder, the basal production of PGE2 is significantly higher than<br>
in control conditions. A number of inflammatory mediators acting through GPCR<br>
pathways that are linked to the production of arachidonic acid may up-regulate<br>
prostaglandin levels in the mucosa and vascular endothelium. Bradykinin is a well-<br>
established mediator of inflammation, and bradykinin receptor agonists stimulate greater<br>
PGE2 production in inflamed bladders than in control bladders. Topical application of<br>
bradykinin activates bladder sensory nerves. Lecci, A., et al., Kinin Bl Receptor-<br>

the Guinea-Pig Isolated Urinary Bladder to Bradykinin, Br. J. Pharmacol. 98:619-29<br>
(1989). Contractile responses elicited by the selective B1 and B2 receptor agonists tested<br>
in isolated rat urinary bladder strips showed that the contractile responses to a selective<br>
Bl agonist were also potentiated in inflamed bladders. The role of bradykinin in reflex<br>
voiding has also been investigated in normal rats using continuous infusion cystometry.<br>
Infusion of bradykinin produced a significant decrease in the intercontraction interval<br>
(ICI) between voiding events and an increase in bladder contraction amplitude that is<br>
completely blocked by a B2 receptor antagonist.<br>
Microvascular leakage induced by administration of substance P acting through<br>
the NK1 receptor also involves the release of cyclooxygenase metabolites of arachidonic<br>
acid. Abelli, L., et al., Microvascular Leakage Induced by Substance P in Rat Urinary<br>
Bladder: Involvement of Cyclo-oxygenase Metabolites of Arachidonic Acid, J. Auton.<br>
Pharmacol. 12:269-76 (1992). These findings demonstrate that distinct inflammatory<br>
mediators act through independent receptor mechanisms to trigger the production of<br>
prostaglandins. NSAIDs that act at a common target downstream of multiple GPCRs to<br>
inhibit COX-1/COX-2 have the capacity to block the formation of prostaglandins derived<br>
from multiple pro inflammatory mediators.<br>
A number of studies have shown that both COX-1 and COX-2 are involved in the<br>
production of PGE2 during tissue trauma and the acute inflammatory response. Martinez,<br>
R., et al., Involvement of Peripheral Cyclooxygenase-1 and Cyclooxygenase-2 in<br>
Inflammatory Pain, J Pharm Pharmacol. 54:405-412 (2002); Mazario, J, et al.,<br>

et al., Comparison of the Antinociceptive Effect of Celecoxib, Diclofenac and Resveratrol<br>
in the Formalin Test, Life Sci. 70:1669-1676 (2002). In normal bladders, activation of<br>
B2 receptors evokes bladder contraction mediated by COX-1 activity, whereas COX-2<br>
activity is involved in production of PGE2 driven through stimulation of Bl receptors<br>
only. COX-2 is the major isoform that is rapidly expressed and dramatically up-regulated<br>
during bladder inflammation. It is believed to be responsible for the high levels of<br>
prostanoids released during acute and chronic inflammation of the bladder. COX-2 is up-<br>
regulated in response to proinflammatory cytokines and bladder treatment with either<br>
endotoxin or cyclophosphamide. Both COX isozymes are therefore suitable molecular<br>
targets for the drug compositions of the present invention.<br>
An aspect of the present invention is directed to therapeutic compositions<br>
including a cyclooxygenase inhibitor in a carrier suitable for local delivery to urologic<br>
-10-<br>
PH.1.0050.PCT.AP 03.17.06<br>

structures in the urinary tract. To achieve maximal inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis<br>
at sites of acute inflammation, it is believed desirable to inhibit both COX isoenzymes.<br>
The COX inhibitor is therefore preferably non-selective with respect to activity at<br>
COX-1 and COX-2, which for purposes of the present invention may be defined as an<br>
agent for which the ratio of (a) the concentration of the agent effective for the inhibition<br>
of 50% (IC50) of the activity of COX-1 relative to (b) the IC50 for the inhibition of the<br>
activity of COX-2 is greater than or equal to 0.1 and less than or equal to 10.0, and more<br>
preferably is greater than or equal to 0.1 and less than or equal to 1.0. Suitable assays for<br>
determining COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitory effect are disclosed in Riendau, D., et al.,<br>

inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) and Selective COX-2 Inhibitors, Using Sensitive<br>
Microsomal and Platelet Assays, Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 75:1088-1095 (1997).<br>
Suitable non-selective COX-1/COX-2 inhibitors include, for purposes of<br>
illustration, salicylic acid derivatives including aspirin, sodium salicylate, choline<br>
magnesium trisalicylate, salsalate, diflunisal, sulfasalazine and olsalazine, para-<br>
aminophenol derivatives such as acetaminophen, indole and indene acetic acids such as<br>
indomethacin and sulindac, heteroaryl acetic acids including tolmetin, diclofenac and<br>
keterolac, arylpropionic acids including ibuprofen, naproxen, flurbiprofen, ketoprofen,<br>
fenoprofen and oxaprozin, anthranilic acids (fenamates) including mefanamic acid and<br>
meclofenamic acid, enolic acids including oxicams such as piroxicam and meloxicam and<br>
alkanones such as nabumetone, as well as pharmaceutically effective esters, salts,<br>
isomers, conjugates and prodrugs thereof.<br>
Still more preferably, the non-selective COX-1/COX-2 inhibitor is an<br>
arylpropionic acid, i.e., a propionic acid derivative, such as ketoprofen, dexketoprofen,<br>
ibuprofen, naproxen, flurbiprofen, fenoprofen and oxaprozin. Most preferably, the agent<br>
is ketoprofen.<br>

in the compositions and methods of the present invention is selected as having an IC50<br>
for the inhibition of bradykinin-induced bladder smooth-muscle strip contractility (as<br>
determined by the bladder contractility model described herein below) of less than or<br>
equal to 100 µM, preferably less than or equal to 25 µM, more preferably less than or<br>
equal to 5 µM, still more preferably less than 2 µM.<br>
In a further aspect of the invention, the non-selective COX-1/COX-2 inhibitor<br>
used in the compositions and methods of the present invention is selected as having an<br>

In a still further aspect of the invention, the non-selective COX-1/COX-2 inhibitor<br>
used in the compositions and methods of the present invention is selected as having (a) an<br>
IC50 for the inhibition of bradykinin-induced bladder smooth-muscle strip contractility<br>
(as determined by the bladder contractility model described herein below) of less than or<br>

equal to 5 µM, still more preferably less than 2 µM, and (b) an IC50 for the inhibition of<br>
bradykinin-induced PGE2 (as determined by the PGE2 bladder tissue analysis model<br>
described herein below) of less than or equal to 100 µM , preferably less than or equal to<br>
25 µM, more preferably less that or equal to 5 µM, still more preferably less than 2 µM.<br>
The above noted IC50 concentrations are not to be interpreted as limitations on<br>
drug concentrations in the compositions of the present invention, which may suitably be<br>
determined by the concentrations needed to approach maximal effectiveness and thus may<br>
be higher than the IC50 levels.<br>
In a still further aspect of the invention, the non-selective COX-1/COX-2 inhibitor<br>
used in the compositions and methods of the present invention is selected as having a pA2<br>
(antagonist potency) of greater than or equal to 7, wherein pA2 is the negative logarithm<br>
of the concentration of antagonist that would produce a 2-fold shift in the concentration<br>
response curve for an agonist, and is a logarithmic measure of the potency of an<br>
antagonist. This potency corresponds to an equilibrium dissociation constant KD of less<br>
than or equal to 100 nM.<br>
In a still further aspect of the invention, the non-selective COX-1/COX-2 inhibitor<br>
used in the compositions and methods of the present invention exhibits 50% of maximal<br>
inhibitory response in less than or equal to 10 minutes in a kinetic study of bradykinin-<br>
stimulated PGE2 response in the PGE2 bladder tissue analysis model described herein<br>
below.<br>
Ketoprofen<br>
Unless used in a context also referring to its isomer, references herein to the use of<br>
ketoprofen (i.e., m-benzoylhydratropic acid or 3-benzoyl-α-methylbenzeneacetic acid) in<br>
the present invention are to be understood to also include pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
isomers thereof, including its racemic S-(+)-enantiomer, dexketoprofen, pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts or esters thereof, and pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs or conjugates<br>
thereof. Ketoprofen is a preferred COX inhibitor for use in the present invention.<br>
Ketoprofen exhibits potent anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic actions<br>
that are associated with the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis and antagonism of the<br>
effects of bradykinin. Ketoprofen non-selectively inhibits the activity of COX-1 and<br>
-12-<br>
PH.1.0050.PCT.AP 03.17.06<br>
3/17/2006 3:58:27 PM<br><br>
COX-2, which results in the blockade of prostaglandin production, particularly that of<br>
PGE2, preventing the development of hyperalgesia. Ketoprofen has an IC50 value of<br>
4 - 8 nM in a non-selective COX assay, being functionally 6-12 times more potent than<br>
other NSAIDs evaluated (e.g., naproxen or indomethacin). Kantor, T., Ketoprofen: A<br>
review of its Pharmacologic and Clinical Properties, Pharmacotherapy 6:93-103 (1986).<br>
Ketoprofen also has functional bradykinin antagonist activity, its effects being eight times<br>
greater than those seen with the classical NSAID, indomethacin. Julou, L., et al.,<br>
Ketoprofen (19.583 R.P.) (2-(3-Benzoylphenyl)-propionic acid). Main Pharmacological<br>
Properties - Outline of Toxicological and Pharmacokinetic Data, Scand J Rheumatol<br>
Suppl. 0:33-44 (1976).<br>
In addition to inhibiting cyclooxygenase, ketoprofen is believed to offer the<br>
additional anti-inflammatory benefit of inhibiting lipoxygenase. Ketoprofen has also<br>
been found to synergise with nifedipine in the inhibition of bladder spasm, as discussed in<br>
greater detail in the examples below.<br>
Calcium Channel Antagonists<br>
Multiple inflammatory mediators, including bradykinin, are released into the<br>
bladder in response to tissue injury, which can trigger smooth muscle contraction and<br>
spasm. The tone of the urinary bladder smooth muscle is regulated by numerous<br>
contraction-promoting receptor systems. They include well established systems such as<br>
muscarinic, purinergic and tachykinin receptors [Anderson, K., et al., Pharmacolgy of the<br>
Lower Urinary Tract: Basis for Current and Future Treatments for Urinary Incontenance<br>
Pharmacol Rev. 56:581-631 (2004)], and also include endothelin receptors [Afiatpour, P.,<br>
et al., Development Changes in the Functional, Biochemical and Molecular Properties of<br>
Rat Bladder Endothelin Receptors, Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. 367:462-72<br>
(2003)], protease-activated receptors and bradykinin receptors [Kubota, Y., et al., Role of<br>
Mitochondria in the Generation of Spontaneous Activity in Detrusor Smooth Muscles of<br>
the Guinea Pig Bladder, J. Urol. 170:628-33 (2003); Trevisani, M., et al., Evidence for In<br>
Vitro Expression of Bl Receptor in the Mouse Trachea and Urinary Bladder, Br. J.<br>
Pharmacol. 126:1293-1300 (1999)]. Because many of these receptors are prototypically<br>
coupled via Gq proteins to the activation of a phospholipase C (PLC), it is likely that<br>
bladder contraction elicited by such receptors is partly mediated by PLC-linked<br>
mobilization of Ca2+ from intraceliular stores [Ouslander, J. G., Management of<br>
Overactive Bladder, N. Engl. J. Med., 350:786-99 (2004)].<br>
Neurally mediated contractions of the bladder and urethral smooth muscle require<br>
mobilization of intraceliular Ca2+ as well as an influx of extracellular Ca2+. Ca2+ entry<br>
through L-type calcium channels can contribute to muscle contractions by triggering the<br>
intraceliular release of Ca2+, which opens ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ release channels in the<br>
-13-<br>
PH.1.0050.PCT.AP 03.17.06<br>
3/17/2006 3:58:27 PM<br><br>
sarcoplasmic reticulum. Opening of L-type calcium channels in bladder muscle also<br>
serves to replace intracellular Ca2+ stores after contraction. Recent studies conclude that<br>
muscarinic receptor subtype signaling mediated via carbachol-induced contraction of rat<br>
bladders largely depends on Ca2+ entry through L-type calcium channels and, perhaps,<br>
PLD, PLA2 and store-operated Ca"+ channels. Schneider, T., et al., Signal Transduction<br>
Underlying Carbachol-induced Contraction of Rat Urinary Bladder: I. Phospholipases<br>
and Ca2+ sources, J Pharmacol Exp Ther (2003). Thus, blockade of L-type Ca2+<br>
channels has the potential to depress neural, urothelial and smooth muscle evoked<br>
contractions of bladder strips mediated by a multiplicity of endogenous GPCR agonists.<br>
The L-type calcium channel represents a point of integration for the convergence of<br>
multiple inflammatory mediators that can lead to hyperactive smooth muscle contractility.<br>
Ca 2+ channels located in afferent and efferent nerve terminals in the lower urinary<br>
tract are also important for regulation of neurotransmitter release, de Groat, W., et al.,<br>
Pharmacology of the Lower Urinary Tract, Annu. Rev. Pharmacol Toxicol. 41:691-721<br>
(2001). A number of active agents produce Ca + influx and transmitter release from the<br>
peripheral nerve endings of capsaicin-sensitive afferent neurons through voltage-sensitive<br>
Ca2+ channels. Under certain conditions, L-type Ca2+ channels can also contribute to<br>
transmitter release.<br>
The significant role of the L-type Ca2+ channel in the initiation of smooth muscle<br>
contraction makes this channel a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of lower<br>
urinary tract problems that involve hyperactivity or spasm of smooth muscle tissues. In<br>
the presence of inflammatory mediators, signaling through these same channels may<br>
mediate bladder hyperactivity and spasm.<br>
An aspect of the present invention is thus directed to therapeutic compositions<br>
including a calcium channel antagonist in a carrier suitable for delivery to urologic<br>
structures in the urinary tract. The calcium channel antagonist is preferably an L-type<br>
calcium channel antagonist, such as verapamil, diltiazem, bepridil, mibefradil, nifedipine,<br>
nicardipine, isradipine, amlodipine, felodipine, nisoldipine and nimodipine, as well as<br>
pharmaceutically effective esters, salts, isomers, conjugates and prodrugs thereof. Still<br>
more preferably,' the calcium channel antagonist is a dihydropyridine, such as nifedipine,<br>
nicardipine, isradipine, amlodipine, felodipine, nisoldipine and nimodipine, as well as<br>
pharmaceutically effective esters, salts, isomers, conjugates and prodrugs thereof. Most<br>
suitably, the agent is nifedipine.<br>
Nifedipine<br>
References herein to nifedipine, 1,4-dihydro-2,6-dimethyl-4-(2-nitrophenyl)-3,5-<br>
pyridinedicarboxylic acid dimethyl ester, are to be understood to also include<br>
pharmaceuticaliy acceptable isomers thereof, pharmaceutically acceptable salts or esters<br>
-14-<br>
PH.1.0050.PCT.AP 03.17.06<br>
3/17/2006 3:58:27 PM<br><br>
thereof, and pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs or conjugates thereof. Nifedipine is a<br>
preferred calcium channel antagonist for use in the present invention.<br>
Nifedipine is a member of the dihydropyridine class of calcium channel<br>
antagonists with pharmacological specificity for the L-type channel (alternatively termed<br>
the Cavl.2 a-subunit). Nifedipine has a rapid onset of action (less than 10 minutes),<br>
which is desirable for use in urological procedures, and as such is more preferred than<br>
certain closely related dihydropryidine calcium channel antagonists (e.g., amlodipine) that<br>
require longer periods for initial action. The time to response for steady-state inhibition<br>
of muscle contraction ideally occur within 10-15 minutes of initial local drug delivery,<br>
and nifedipine fulfills this criterion.<br>
Carriers<br>
The pain/inflammation and/or spasm agents of the present invention are suitably<br>
delivered in solution or in suspension in a liquid carrier, which as used herein is intended<br>
to encompass biocompatible solvents, suspensions, polymerizable and non-polymerizable<br>
gels, pastes and salves. Preferably, the carrier is an aqueous irrigation solution that may<br>
or may not include physiologic electrolytes, such as saline, distilled water, lactated<br>
Ringer's solution, glycine .solutions, sorbitol solutions, manitol solutions or<br>
sorbital/manitol solutions. The carrier may also include a sustained release delivery<br>
vehicle, such as microparticles, microspheres or nanoparticles composed of proteins,<br>
liposomes, carbohydrates, synthetic organic compounds, or inorganic compounds.<br>
The compositions of the present invention may also be coated on ureteral and<br>
urethral stents, catheters, radioactive seeds, seed spacers and other implantable devices<br>
and on surgical instruments, for local delivery from such devices and instruments into the<br>
urinary tract as further described below. Polymers that may be suitably employed to form<br>
a drug impregnated stent or other implantable device include, by way of non-limiting<br>

Suitable alternate or additional spasm inhibitory agents include serotonin receptor<br>
antagonists (e.g., amitriptyline, imipramine, trazodone, desipramine, ketanserin,<br>

Methods of Use<br>
Periprocedural Delivery<br>
Local perioperative delivery of the compositions of the present invention are<br>
expected to preemptively inhibit pain, inflammation and smooth muscle spasm otherwise<br>
associated with urological procedures. The compositions of the present invention act on<br>
molecular targets, i.e., receptors, enzymes and ion channels, that initiate pain,<br>
inflammation and spasm pathways and mechanisms. The present invention employs local<br>
periprocedural delivery to inhibit these pathophysiologic processes at the time they are<br>
initiated. For example, multiple proinflammatory peptides stimulate the release of PGE2<br>
from bladder tissue within the first five minutes of exposure, as shown in the examples<br>
below. Solely postprocedurally administered therapeutic agents can only take effect after<br>
these processes have commenced.<br>
Local Delivery<br>
Local delivery of drugs in accordance with the present invention permits the<br>
utilization of a much lower dosage than would be needed if the same drugs were<br>
administered systemically (e.g., orally, intravenously, intramuscularly, subcutaneously) to<br>
achieve the same predetermined local level of inhibitory effect in the urinary tract. The<br>
focused, local delivery of the present invention results in a significantly lower plasma<br>
level of the drug than would result from systemic delivery of the drug to achieve the same<br>
predetermined local level of inhibitory effect in the urinary tract, thereby reducing the<br>
potential for undesirable systemic side effects. Local delivery permits the inclusion in the<br>
-18-<br>
PH.1.0050.PCT.AP 03.17.06<br>
3/17/2006 3:58:27 PM<br><br>
compositions of the present invention of drugs such as peptides that are not susceptible to<br>
systemic delivery due to degradation during first- and second-pass metabolism.<br>
Local delivery of drug compositions in accordance with the present invention<br>
provides for an immediate and certain therapeutic concentration at the local urinary tract<br>
site, which is not dependent on variations in metabolism or organ function. A constant<br>
concentration of the drugs can be maintained during the period of delivery of the<br>
composition during the procedure.<br>
Urological Procedures<br>
The compositions of the present invention can be locally delivered before, during<br>
and/or after cystoscopy, i.e., the endoscopic examination of the urethra and bladder<br>
through a cystoscope inserted into the lower urinary tract for purposes of examining the<br>
urinary tract structures, preferably periprocedurally during such procedures. The<br>
compositions of the present invention may also be used before, during and/or after<br>
(preferably periprocedurally during) other diagnostic, interventional, medical and surgical<br>
procedures performed in conjunction with cystoscopy, by insertion of surgical instruments<br>
through the cystoscope, such as for the removal of tissue for biopsy, removal of growths,<br>
removal of foreign bodies, bladder or kidney stone removal, placement, removal and<br>
manipulation of urethral stents, transurethral resection of bladder tumors (TURBT),<br>
treatment of tumors with electrocautery or laser or local chemotherapeutics, treatment of<br>
bleeding in the bladder or to relieve obstructions in the urethra.<br>
The compositions of the present invention can be locally delivered to the urinary<br>
tract before, during and/or after ureteroscopy, i.e., the endoscopic examination of the<br>
ureters and renal tissues through an ureteroscope inserted through the urethra and bladder<br>
and into a ureter for purposes of examining the urinary tract structures, preferably<br>
periperatively during such procedures. Ureteroscopy is often performed for the drawing<br>
of urine samples from each kidney, the placement, removal and manipulation of ureteral<br>
stents, as part of the treatment for kidney stones, or to place a catheter in the ureter for a<br>
retrograde pyelography, and the compositions of the present invention can be delivered<br>
before, during and/or after such procedures, preferable periprocedurally during such<br>
procedures. A basket or other instrument employed via the ureteroscope can be used to<br>
capture the stone, the stone may be broken up by laser or shock wave lithotripsy through<br>
the ureteroscope, or the ureteroscope may be employed to displace a lodged stone back<br>
into the kidney for subsequent breaking up and passage, such as by using a laser or<br>
extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL).<br>
The compositions of the present invention are suitably locally delivered to the<br>
urinary tract before, during and/or after procedures that typically result in ureteral spasm,<br>

such as kidney stone removal using laser treatment, cystoscopy, ureteroscopy or<br>
lithotripsy, and preferably periprocedurally during such stone removal procedures.<br>
The compositions of the present invention may also be locally delivered to the<br>
urinary tract before, during and/or after (preferably periprocedurally) urological<br>
procedures that cause thermal trauma to tissue in and/or associated with the urinary tract.<br>
These include laser treatment to fragment stones or ablate tissue, microwave ablation of<br>
tissue (e.g., transurethral microwave thermotherapy (TUMT) to remove prostatic tissue), <br>
radiofrequency ablation of tissue (e.g., transurethral needle ablation (TUNA) to remove<br>
prostatic tissue), electrocauterization or vaporization of tissue or cryoblation of tissue.<br>
The compositions of the present invention may also be locally delivered to the<br>
urinary tract before, during and/or after (preferably periprocedurally) urological<br>
procedures employing a laser for tissue resection, including Holmium: yttrium-aluminum-<br>
garnet (Ho:YAG), neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd:YAG) and potassium-<br>
titanyl-phosphate (KTP) "green light" laser therapies. Such laser procedures may include<br>
the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and bladder tumors, by way of non-<br>
limiting example.<br>
The ketoprofen composition, calcium channel antagonist and ketoprofen<br>
combination composition and the preferred ketoprofen and nifedipine combination<br>
composition of the present invention may also be locally delivered to the urinary tract<br>
before, during and/or after (preferably periprocedurally) transurethral resection of the<br>
prostate (TURP).<br>
In addition to transurethral procedures such as those discussed above, the<br>
compositions of the present invention may also be suitably employed for local delivery<br>
during other minimally invasive urological procedures. These include, by way of<br>
example, the transrectal or transperitoneal delivery of the compositions of the present<br>
invention to the prostate and surrounding anatomic structures during implantation of<br>
radioactive seeds and seed spacers to treat prostate cancer or prostatitis, and the<br>
transrectal or transperitoneal delivery of the compositions of the present invention to the<br>
prostate to treat prostatitis.<br>
The compostions of the present invention are suitably locally delivered to the<br>
urinary tract before, during and/or after (preferably periprocedurally) procedures that<br>
standardly include irrigation, such as TURP, transurethral incision of the prostate (TUIP),<br>
laser prostatectomy, cystoscopy, ureteroscopy and other procedures in which irrigation is<br>
used to aid visualization by removing blood and tissue debris from the operative field.<br>
The compositions of the present invention can be added to the irrigation solution<br>
standardly used in such procedures, e.g., saline, distilled water, lactated Ringer's solution,<br>
-20-<br>
PH.1.0050.PCT.AP 03.17.06<br>

glycine, sorbitol, manitol, sorbital/manitol, at dilute levels, with no change to the<br>
urologist's standard procedure being required.<br>
The compositions of the present invention can also be locally delivered by coating<br>
ureteral stents, uretheral stents, catheters, radioactive seeds, seed spacers or other<br>
implantable devices or surgical instilments, or impregnating or otherwise incorporating<br>
the therapeutic agents into the body of stents, catheters, radioactive seeds, seed spacers or<br>
other implantable devices or surgical instruments constructed from a polymeric material<br>
or mesh. Techniques for coating devices with drugs and impregnating devices with drugs<br>
are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art, and coatings or polymeric materials<br>
may be designed to permit the drugs (e.g., a COX inhibitor and a calcium channel<br>
antagonist) to begin releasing into the urinary tract upon implantation and continuing for a<br>
period of time following implantation.<br>
Formulation<br>
One aspect of the invention is directed to a composition including a<br>
cyclooxygenase inhibitor and a calcium channel antagonist, preferably ketoprofen and<br>
nifedipine, which are dissolved in an aqueous solution for parenteral delivery, preferably<br>
for intravesicular delivery. Alternately such compositions can be manufactured in a<br>
lyophilized form and then reconstituted with an aqueous solvent prior to administration.<br>
The cyclooxygenase inhibitor and calcium channel antagonist are suitably<br>
included in a molar ratio (cyclooxygenase inhibitoncalcium channel antagonist) of from<br>
10:1 to 1:10, preferably from 5:1 to 1:5, more preferably from 4:1 to 1:1, and most<br>
preferably 3:1. Similarly, in a preferred composition ketoprofen and nifedipine are<br>
suitably included in a molar ratio (ketoprofen:nifedipine) of from 10:1 to 1:10, preferably<br>
from 5:1 to 1:5, more preferably from 4:1 to 1:1, and most preferably approximately (i.e.,<br>
+/-20%)3:l.<br>
For compositions formulated to be delivered locally in a liquid carrier, the<br>
cyclooxygenase inhibitor such as ketoprofen is suitably included at a concentration (as<br>
diluted for local delivery) of no more than 500,000 nanomolar, preferably no more than<br>
300,000 nanomolar, more preferably no more than 100,000 nanomolar and most<br>
preferably less than 50,000 nanomolar. The calcium channel antagonist such as<br>
nifedipine is suitably included at a concentration (as diluted for local delivery) of no more<br>
than 200,000 nanomolar, preferably no more than 100,000 nanomolar, more preferably no<br>
more than 50,000 nanomolar and most preferably less than 25,000 nanomolar.<br>
The compositions of the present invention may be formulated in an aqueous or<br>
organic solvent, but preferably are formulated in an aqueous solvent. When using<br>
aqueous solutions, an additional solvent or solvents (i.e., cosolvents or solubilizing<br>
agents) may suitably be included to aid in dissolution of the drugs. Examples of suitable<br>
-21-<br>
PH.1.0050.PCT.AP 03.17.06<br>
3/17/2006 3:58:27 PM<br><br>
solvents include polyethylene glycol (PEG) of various molecular weights (e.g., PEG 200,<br>
300, 400, 540, 600, 900, 1000, 1450, 1540, 2000, 3000, 3350, 4000, 4600, 6000, 8000,<br>
20,000, 35,000), propylene glycol, glycerin, ethyl alcohol, oils, ethyl oleate, benzyl<br>
benzoate, and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). A preferred cosolvent for the compositions of<br>
the present invention is PEG, most preferably PEG 400.<br>
In a further aspect of the present invention, the composition includes ketoprofen<br>
and nifedipine in an aqueous solution including at least one stabilizing agent. The term<br>
stabilizing agent is used herein to refer to an agent that inhibits degradation of the active<br>
pharmaceutical ingredients and/or extends the duration of stability of the solution when<br>
stored under either refrigerated (e.g., 2-8°C) or ambient temperature conditions, and<br>
includes both anti-oxidants and chelating agents. The solution may also suitably include<br>
one or more cosolvents or buffering agents. Preferably the aqueous ketoprofen and<br>
nifedipine solution includes one or more antioxidants as stabilizing agent(s), a cosolvent<br>
and a buffering agent. The preferred ketoprofen and nifedipine solution formulation is<br>
stable when stored at between 2°C and 25°C for a period of at least six months, preferably<br>
one year, more preferably two years, most preferably longer than two years, and can be<br>
readily diluted with standard urologic irrigation solutions for local intravesicular delivery<br>
during urological procedures.<br>
Examples of suitable antioxidants for use as stabilizing agents in the compositions<br>
of the present invention include water soluble antioxidants such as sodium bisulfite,<br>
sodium sulfite, sodium metabisulfite, sodium thiosulfate, sodium formaldehyde<br>
sulphoxylate, ascorbic acid, acetylcysteine, cysteine, thioglycerol, thioglycollic acid,<br>
thiolactic acid, thiourea, dithithreitol, and glutathione, or oil soluble antioxidants such as<br>
propyl gallate, butylated hydroxyanisole, butylated hydroxytoluene, ascorbyl palmitate,<br>
nordihydroguaiaretic acid and a-tocopherol. A preferred stabilizing agent for the present<br>
invention is propyl gallate. When included in an aqueous compositon, a cosolvent is<br>
included solubilizing oil soluble antioxidants such as propyl gallate. A preferred aqueous<br>
ketoprofen and nifedipine composition of the present invention includes PEG 400 as a<br>
cosolvent and propyl gallate as a stabilizing agent, and may more preferably also include<br>
a second stabilizing agent such as a water soluble antioxidant, most preferably sodium<br>
metabisulfite. A suitable range of concentrations for antioxidant(s) is typically about<br>
0.001% to about 5%, preferably about 0.002% to about 1.0%, and more preferably about<br>
0.01% to about 0.5%, by weight of the composition.<br>
Because of the involvement of divalent cations in catalyzing oxidation reactions,<br>
the inclusion of a chelating agent as a stabilizing agent may be useful in the compositions<br>
of the present invention. Examples of suitable chelating agents for use in the<br>
compositions of the present invention include the various salts of ethylenediarnine<br>
-22-<br>
PH.1.0050.PCT.AP 03.17.06<br>
3/17/2006 3:58:27 PM<br><br>
tetraacetic acid salts (EDTA), β-hydroxyethylenediaminetriacetic acid (HEDTA),<br>
diethylenetriamine-pentaacetic acid (DTPA) and nitrilotriacetate (NTA).<br>
The compositions of the present invention suitably include a buffering agent to<br>
maintain pH. Examples of suitable buffering agents for inclusion in the compositions of<br>
the present invention include acetic acid and its salts, citric acid and its salts, glutamic<br>
acid and its salt and phosphoric acid and its salts. Citric acid also has the ability to<br>
chelate divalent cations and can thus also prevent oxidation, thereby serving two<br>
functions as both a buffering agent and an antioxidant stabilizing agent. A preferred<br>
aqueous ketoprofen and nifedipine composition of the present invention includes citric<br>
acid (such as in the form of sodium citrate) as a buffering agent and antioxidant, and in a<br>
more preferred composition also includes PEG 400 as a cosolvent and propyl gallate and<br>
sodium metabisulfite as stabilizing agents.<br>
The compositions of the present invention may also include additional excipients<br>
and adjuvants. Excipients may include a preservative to protect against microbial growth,<br>
especially for multiple-dose containers. Suitable excipients include antimicrobial agents<br>
such as benzyl alcohol, chlorobutanol, thimiserol, methyl paraben and propyl paraben.<br>
Excipients may also include a surfactant to reduce surface tension and thereby facilitate<br>
wetting for dissolution. Examples of suitable surfactants include polyoxyethylene<br>
sorbitan monooleate and sorbitan monooleate. Excipients may also include tonicity<br>
adjustment agents to render the solution iso-osmotic with physiologic fluids. Examples<br>
of suitable tonicity agents include sodium chloride, sodium sulfate, mannitol, glucose,<br>
sucrose, trehalose, and sorbitol. Additional excipients may include a colorant to impart<br>
color, such as FD&amp; C No. 1 blue dye, FD&amp;C No. 4 red dye, red ferric oxide, yellow ferric<br>
oxide, titanium dioxide, carbon black, and indigo tar pigments.<br>

Example I<br>
The Effect of COX Inhibitors on Bradykinin Induced PGE2 Production in Rat Bladders<br>
The following studies evidence that bradykinin induces immediate<br>
prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production in the bladder, and demonstrate the effects of<br>
cyclooxygenase inhibitors on this process. Bradykinin was chosen as the activating<br>
agonist for testing in this system because its actions on the rat bladder tissue system have<br>
been well characterized and because its role as a proinflammatory agent in acute<br>
pathophysiology has been studied. Bradykinin is also known to stimulate contraction of<br>

smooth muscle of the bladder when delivered intravesically by activation of Bl and B2<br>
receptor subtypes.<br>
1. Introduction<br>
Acute, localized inflammatory responses in the lower urinary tract, including<br>
spasm, are triggered by surgical trauma. In response to tissue injury, multiple<br>
inflammatory mediators, including bradykinin and Substance P (SP) are released into the<br>
bladder. Exogenous application of these pro-inflammatory peptides or activation of<br>
bladder nerves can trigger the production of prostaglandins (PGs) in the bladder. The aim<br>
of this study was to characterize the time course of production of PGs in response to an<br>
inflammatory mediator and evaluate the effects of COX-1/COX-2 inhibitors on bladder<br>
tissue contractility in vitro and in vivo. The rat bladder tissue strip system represents a<br>
well established system for characterization of the pharmacological actions on numerous<br>
agents on smooth muscle bladder contractility [Edwards, G., et al., Comparison of the<br>
Effects of Several Potassium-Channel Openers on Rat Bladder and Rat Portal Vein In<br>
Vitro, Br. J. Pharmacol. 102:679-80 (1991); Birder, L., et al., β-adrenoceptor Agonists<br>
Stimulate Endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase in Rat Urinary Bladder Urothelial Cells, J.<br>
Neurosci. 22:8063-70 (2002)].<br>
2. Bladder Strip Contractility<br>
Method<br>
Isolated bladder smooth muscle strips of 1x2x15 mm dimension were obtained<br>
from Wistar derived male or female rats weighing 275 + 25 g that were sacrificed by CO2<br>
overexposure. Each strip was placed under 1 g tension in a 10 ml bath containing Krebs<br>
solution withl µM enalaprilic acid (MK-422), composition (g/1): NaCl 6.9, KC1 0.35,<br>
KH2PO4 0.16, NaHCO3 2.1, CaCl2 0.28, MgSO 4.7, H2O 0.29, (+)Glucose 1.8, pH 7.4<br>
bubbled with 95% O2/5% CO2 at 32 C. Each strip was connected to an isometric<br>
transducer (Harvard, # 50-7293) and two-pen recorder and allowed to equilibrate for 60<br>
minutes. Before starting the experiment, mounted tissues were validated for acceptance<br>
by challenge with 100 µM of methoxamine to obtain a minimum of 1 g tension, which<br>
was considered as 100%. Qualified tissues were washed repeatedly every 15 minutes for<br>
60 minutes. A cumulative contraction-response curve to bradykinin was then generated<br>
through application of 3 concentrations of bradykinin (0.01 µM, 0.1 µM and 1 µM) at 1<br>
minute intervals for a total of 3 minutes. The tissue was subsequently washed<br>
periodically until tension returned to baseline value. Two hours later, the ability to inhibit<br>
the bradykinin cumulative dose response (0.01 µM, 0.1 µM and 1 µM) after a 10 minute<br>
pretreatment with ketoprofen was determined. Each concentration of test substance was<br>
tested in four separate preparations.<br>

Results<br>
FIGURE 2 illustrates the cumulative concentration-response curves of normal<br>
animals to the agonists bradykinin and SP. The EC50 for bradykinin was 8.5 nM and for<br>
SP was 6.5 nM. This provided a validated system for testing the effects of the inhibitory<br>
activity of NSAIDs (COX inhibitors).<br>
FIGURE 3A illustrates bradykinin concentration-response curves produced in the<br>
presence of 0.25, 1.0, 2.5' and 10 µM ketoprofen. The maximal agonist response could<br>
not be determined experimentally for all concentrations of ketoprofen, although curve-<br>
fitting using a standard Hill equation revealed no change in maximal response at<br>
saturating agonist concentrations. Schild analysis was used to calculate the pA2 value of<br>
7.26 for ketoprofen, equivalent to a KD for ketoprofen at its site of action of 5.52 x 10-8 M<br>
(see FIGURE 3B). This finding demonstrates that the potency for inhibition in this tissue<br>
assay system is quite comparable to values obtained from direct enzyme inhibition assays.<br>
3. PGE2 Determination:<br>
Methods<br>
The release of PGE2 from urinary bladder strips into 10 ml of tissue bath was<br>
measured using a specific enzyme immunoassay (EIA) according to the manufacturer's<br>
instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for the basal, bradykinin-induced and COX<br>
inhibitor treatment plus bradykinin-induced samples. The COX inhibitors tested were<br>
ketoprofen, flurbiprofen, 5-bromo-2-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-(4-methylsulfonyl) thiophene<br>
(i.e., DUP-697) and 1-[(4-methysufonyl)phenyl]-3-tri-fluoromethyl-5-(4-<br>
fluorophenyl)pyrazole (i.e., SC-58125). One mL of fluid was collected from the 10 mL<br>
tissue bath after 10 minutes of bradykinin challenge for PGE2 determination. Samples<br>
were frozen immediately and stored at -4°C until assay. The bladder strips were dried<br>
gently by blotting and were then weighed. Results are expressed as picograms of PGE2<br>
released per milligram tissue.<br>
Results<br>
FIGURE 4A illustrates that bradykinin rapidly induces the formation of PGE2 in<br>
rat bladder tissue strips within the first minutes of stimulation and reaches a maximum<br>
within 30 minutes. The t1/2 for formation was about 7.5 minutes. FIGURE 4B illustrates<br>
the rapid kinetics of PGE2 formation detected within the first ten minutes.<br>
Ketoprofen inhibition of bradykinin-induced bladder strip contraction was closely<br>
correlated with inhibition of PGE2 formation, as shown in Table 2. Non-selective COX-<br>
l/COX-2 inhibitors were found to be effective in blocking bradykinin-stimulated PGE2,<br>
-26-<br>
PH.1.0050.PCT.AP 03.17.06<br>
3/17/2006 3:58:27 PM<br><br>
while COX-2 selective agents were not effective. This corresponds to a lack of COX-2<br>
inhibitor activity under bradykinin-induced normal cystometry parameters.<br>

FIGURE 1 (described previously) provides a model for action of prostaglandin<br>
activity. Activation of bradykinin receptors on urothelial cells may produce PGs in the<br>
urothelium, which in turn may activate bladder nerves (C-fiber and A5 fibers) to affect<br>
bladder contractility and control micturition reflexes. Ketoprofen inhibits formation of<br>
PGE2.<br>
4. In Vivo Rat Cystometry Model<br>
Methods<br>
The rats were anesthetized with urethane at 1.2 g/kg i.p. in 5 ml/kg. A<br>
polyethylene catheter (PE50) was implanted into the bladder for saline or acetic acid<br>
infusion through a 3-way stopcock. A pressure transducer was connected for<br>
measurements of intravesical pressure. Warm (37°C) saline was infused into the bladder<br>
at a constant rate of 16.7 ml/min (1 ml/hour) until cystometry became stable (no less than<br>
60 minutes). Thereafter, 0.2% acetic acid was infused into the urinary bladder. Aspirin<br>
(10 mg/kg i.v.) and vehicle were administered intravenously via a PE-10 catheter in the<br>
femoral vein at 5 minutes after infusion of acetic acid was started and at the end of first<br>
micturition cycle. Dunnett's test was applied for comparison between the time before and<br>
after test substance or vehicle treatment. To ascertain differences between the test<br>
substance and the vehicle control group, an unpaired Student's t test was used.<br>

6. Discussion<br>
These studies demonstrate that PGE2 is rapidly produced in rat bladder tissue<br>
following stimulation with bradykinin and that its formation is inhibited by a 10 minute<br>
pre-incubation with ketoprofen. Non-selective COX-1/COX-2 inhibitors were<br>
demonstrated simultaneously to have blocked the rapid production of PGs in bladder<br>
tissue and tissue contractility. Aspirin and other non-selective COX-1/COX-2 inhibitors<br>
effectively inhibited cystometric changes induced by intravesical acetic acid stimulation.<br>
These studies suggest that delivery of ketoprofen to the urinary tract may be<br>
therapeutically beneficial for periprocedural bladder hyperactivity.<br>
Example II<br>
Effects of Ketoprofen and Nifedipine Individually on<br>
Bradykinin Induced Contractility in Rat Bladder Tissue Strips<br>
The purpose of this study was to characterize the effects of ketoprofen, a non-<br>
selective COX-1/COX-2 inhibitor, and nifedipine, an L-type Ca2+ channel antagonist, on<br>
agonist-stimulated rat bladder contractility using bradykinin as a stimulating agonist.<br>
1. Methods<br>
Ketoprofen USP and nifedipine USP were dissolved in DMSO prior to dilution to<br>
the final concentration. Bladder tissue strips from Wistar derived rats were prepared,<br>
transduced and equilibrated using the bladder strip contractility method described in<br>
Example I above. Assayed tissue was incubated with the test drugs for 10 minutes before<br>
activities were determined.<br>
A cumulative contraction-response curve to bradykinin was generated through<br>
application of 7 bradykinin concentrations in 3-fold increments ranging from 0.001 µM to<br>
1 µM at 1 minute intervals for a total of 7 minutes to establish the maximal 100% control<br>
response. The tissue was subsequently washed periodically until tension returned to<br>
baseline value. In 24 separate tissues, similar bradykinin concentration-responses were<br>
carried out in the presence of each respective test compound (ketoprofen: 0.25 µM, 1<br>
 µM, 2.5 µM and 10 µM; nifedipine: 0.125 µM, 0.5 µM, 1.25 µM and 5 µM) following a<br>
10 min incubation period. Tissue strips were always used in pairs for the study of the<br>
action of the antagonist (bradykinin) alone and in the presence of a concentration of<br>
antagonist (ketoprofen or nifedipine). Schild plots were obtained using computer<br>
software (Pharmacology Cumulative System, Version 4) and pA2 values were determined.<br>

2. Results<br>
Nifedipine was found to exhibit a noncompetitive type of antagonism upon<br>
bradykinin-induced contractile responses in the in vitro rat bladder preparation. This was<br>
shown by a depression of the maximum agonist response and a small non-parallel<br>
rightward shift of the agonist concentration response curves (FIGURE 6). In contrast, as<br>
previously described in Example I, increasing concentrations of ketoprofen (0.25-10 µM)<br>
produced a series of concentration-response curves (see FIGURE 3A) in which the EC50<br>
agonist response moved progressively to higher concentrations of bradykinin (shift to the<br>
right of over 2 orders of magnitude) with no apparent effect on maximal tension. This<br>
pattern of inhibition is consistent with a competitive mechanism for ketoprofen and was<br>
further analyzed by Schild regression analysis.<br>
For nifedipine, the criteria for application of the Schild regression analysis were<br>
not met due to the noncompetitive pattern of inhibition. Even the lowest concentration of<br>
nifedipine (0.125 µM) resulted in a large reduction in the agonist response (to about 50%<br>
of maximum). These studies of ketoprofen and nifedipine reveal two very different<br>
patterns of inhibition of bradykinin-stimulated contractile tension.<br>
Example III<br>
Effects of Ketoprofen and Nifedipine Combination on<br>
Bradykinin Induced Contractility in Rat Bladder Tissue Strips<br>
The present study evaluated the effects of nifedipine and ketoprofen administered<br>
in combination on the contractile tension response in a rat bladder tissue strip model.<br>
1. Methods<br>
Bladder tissue strips from Wistar derived rats were prepared, transduced and<br>
equilibrated using the bladder strip contractility method described in Example I above<br>
with transduced strips being allowed to equilibrate for 45 minutes. In order to avoid<br>
effects of bradykinin receptor desensitization from the cumulative dosing protocol, two<br>
tissue strips were collected from each animal. The control group consisted of 12 strips and<br>
54 strips were used for the treatment groups.<br>
Before starting the experiment, each pair of tissue strips was qualified by treating<br>
with 0.03 µM bradykinin to determine if the initial difference in maximal contraction<br>
between strips was within +/-15%. Following this procedure, qualified tissues were<br>
washed repeatedly every 15 minutes for 60 minutes. Cumulative concentration-response<br>
curves were generated by application of bradykinin to establish maximal response. For<br>
the control group (n = 12), a cumulative concentration-response curve to bradykinin was<br>
then generated through application of nine concentrations from 0.1 nM to 1.0 µM in 3-<br>
-29-<br><br>
fold steps at one minute intervals, for a total of nine minutes to establish the maximal<br>
100% control response. Response curves for the treatment groups involved pre-<br>
incubation of the bladder tissue for a period of ten minutes (n = 6), followed by<br>
generation of bradykinin cumulative dose-response curves by application of 12<br>
concentrations of bradykinin (0.1 nM - 30 µM).<br>
The concentration range that was chosen for each of the active agents was based<br>
upon results from prior in vitro pharmacological studies of each single agent described in<br>
Examples I and II above. Those studies showed that ketoprofen in the 0.3-3 µM range<br>
had measurable effects on the EC50 for bradykinin activation. Ketoprofen at 3 µM was<br>
near maximal in its ability to shift the EC50 of the bradykinin activated response curves on<br>
muscle contractility. Similarly, prior testing of nifedipine identified a range of<br>
concentrations (0.05-5 µM) effective at inhibiting bradykinin induced tension. A factorial<br>
design characterized the effects of nine different two-drug combinations of ketoprofen<br>
and nifedipine at the following concentrations of (i) ketoprofen: 0.3, 1.0, or 3.0 µM; and<br>
(ii) nifedipine: 0.1, 0.3 or 1.0 µM. The treatment groups (groups 2-10) tested are<br>
summarized in Table 3 below:<br>

The bradykinin concentration-response data was fit to a variable slope sigmoidal<br>
equation, also known as the 3-parameter logistic response (3PL) function, to obtain the<br>
maximal tension, EC50, and Hill slope in which the bottom of the curve was fixed at 0.<br>

The force of contraction in the presence of inhibitors was expressed as a percentage of the<br>
maximum bradykinin effects observed within the same strip before addition of an<br>
inhibitor.<br>
2. Results<br>
The experimental data for all curves allowed curve fitting to accurately define the<br>
maximal tension and EC50 values. The control curve in FIGURE 7 showed that BK<br>
concentration-dependently increased the force of contraction with a pEC50 of 8.14 or 72<br>
nM (n = 12 strips). A moderate Hill slope of 0.65 characterized the activation curve. All<br>
further contraction data was expressed as a percentage of the maximum bradykinin effect<br>
obtained from a set of 12 tissue strips without any tension and without any antagonist<br>
present.<br>
The results for nine distinct combinations of nifedipine and ketoprofen used to<br>
inhibit bradykinin-induced bladder contraction are shown in the following three tables<br>
and three figures. At the lowest concentration of nifedipine and ketoprofen tested, 0.1<br>
µM and 0.3 µM respectively, 38% reduction of the maximal control tension was observed<br>
(Table 4). Increasing concentrations of ketoprofen (1.0 and 3.0 µM) in the presence of<br>
the same concentration of nifedipine further decreased the maximal contractile tension<br>
such that only 30 and 23.4% of the control tension remained, respectively. All<br>
concentration-response curves for bradykinin shifted to the right in the presence of<br>
nifedipine and ketoprofen (0.3-3.0 µM), with the greatest effect seen at the highest<br>
ketoprofen concentration. This combination was accompanied by a 1.0 log unit shift in<br>
the pEC50 versus control. The changes in the EC50 parameter did not appear correlated<br>
with changes in maximal tension. The results are presented graphically in FIGURE 7,<br>
which compares the control group and the group having a constant concentration of 0.1<br>
µM nifedipine with a range of concentrations of ketoprofen. The percent of contraction<br>
for each drug combination is expressed as the percent of the maximal response for the<br>
bradykinin control. The overall pattern of inhibition predominantly reflects a substantial<br>
decrease in maximal tension, demonstrating that the combination of nifedipine and<br>
ketoprofen act together in combination mechanistically in a non-competitive antagonist<br>
manner towards bradykinin-induced contractions.<br>

SEM = Standard error of the mean<br>
Tmax = Maximal tension determined by curve fitting<br>
In the presence of 0.3 µM nifedipine, increasing concentrations of ketoprofen<br>
present in the combination treatment resulted in a progressive decrease in the maximal<br>
tension, from 36.4 to 16.0%. Combinations utilizing the higher concentration of<br>
nifedipine (0.3 µM) resulted in a greater reduction in the maximal tension relative to the<br>
corresponding concentrations of ketoprofen in the presence of 0.1 µM nifedipine. The<br>
maximal tension levels for 0.3 µM nifedipine combinations were determined for three<br>
combinations, in concentration ratios of nifedipine:ketoprofen of 1:1, 1:3.3 and 1:10. The<br>
curve fitted parameters data obtained are presented in Table 5.<br>
Comparison to data corresponding to ketoprofen concentrations in Table 4 shows<br>
that in all cases, greater reductions in the maximal tension were associated with the<br>
greater nifedipine concentration. The greatest change was evident at the lowest<br>
ketoprofen concentration, 0.3 µM, which decreased from 62.11 to 36.41%. The higher<br>
concentrations of ketoprofen resulted in an even greater reduction in tension, such that<br>
only 16% remained at 3.0 µM. Associated with these changes in tension, a similar shift<br>
in the EC50 relative to the control of 0.5 log units was evident for all ketoprofen<br>
concentrations at this nifedipine concentration, as can be seen in FIGURE 8. As in the<br>
case of 0.1 µM nifedipine, no apparent differences between the EC50 values for this<br>
concentration of nifedipine were evident. Small differences in the Hill slopes for<br>
bradykinin agonist responses over the range of inhibitor concentrations were not<br>
significant. The effect of increasing ketoprofen concentrations in the combination<br>
treatment on the concentration-response curves is similar to the graph of the data at<br>
0.1 µM nifedipine and various ketoprofen concentrations. These graphical data also show<br><br>
the non-competitive nature of the antagonism of the BK-response, which is seen for the<br>
combination at this higher concentration of nifedipine.<br>

The overall shapes of the response curves observed in the presence of 1.0 µM<br>
 nifedipine were similar at all concentrations of ketoprofen. At 1.0 µM nifedipine, the<br>
maximal tension levels were less than the corresponding values for 0.3 µM nifedipine<br>
(Table 6 and FIGURE 9), and the magnitude of the additional change due to the presence<br>
of ketoprofen is less relative to lower concentrations of nifedipine. The EC50 values were<br>
uniformly shifted about 0.51 units for all ketoprofen concentrations and were not<br>
correlated with maximal tension. This pattern was consistent with observations at all<br>
other combination concentrations. A small additional increase in the inhibition of<br>
maximal tension due to the change from 1.0 to 3.0 µM ketoprofen was observed at this<br>
highest concentration of nifedipine. At the highest concentrations (1.0 µM nifedipine<br>
plus 3.0 µM ketoprofen), 89% inhibition of the control tension level was achieved.<br>

3. Response Surface Analysis<br>
The concentrations of the two agents (nifedipine and ketoprofen) used in this<br>
combination experiment represent independent variables. The maximal tension is an<br>
effect that results from the combination and is the response variable of primary interest for<br>
the response surface analysis. The relationship between the drug combinations and the<br>
response variable can be represented in a three-dimensional plot in which the<br>
concentrations are plotted as Cartesian coordinates in the x-y-plane, and the response<br>
variable (e.g., maximal tension) is plotted as the vertical distance above the planar point.<br>
The collection of spatial points plotted in this way provides a view that represents the<br>
combined concentration-response relationship. The advantages of this experimental<br>
design method include the fact that the biological response measured is not limited to a<br>
specific response (effect) level of the system. In this way, a number of fixed-ratio<br>
concentration combinations can be tested over a wide range of concentrations to define<br>
the interaction efficacy of the two drugs.<br>
As in the case of single drug concentration-biological effect relationships in which<br>
a smooth curve (or line) may be best fit to the data according to a specific model, a<br>
smooth surface may be fit to the data in a three-dimensional plot of a two-drug<br>
combination concentration-response relationship. This surface represents the additivity or<br>
interaction of the combination. The graph of this response surface becomes the reference<br>
surface for viewing actual combination effects and allows the visualization and prediction<br>
of effects in regions of the curve for which no data could be generated.<br>

A standard response surface analysis was performed on the estimated maximal<br>
tension and EC50 values. The response surface model was fitted using as a response<br>
variable the tension values at the highest agonist concentration on each individual dose<br>
response curve, which was the tension corresponding to 30 µM BK. FIGURE 10 shows<br>
the fitted response surface for the reduced model as a function of ketoprofen and<br>
nifedipine concentration. The combination response curve drops steeply with increasing<br>
concentrations of both ketoprofen and nifedipine. The surface becomes, fairly flat as the<br>
maximal response is obtained as concentrations approach 1 µM nifedipine + 3 µM <br>
ketoprofen. The concentration combination that results in 90% maximal inhibition of the<br>
effect of bradykinin is 3 µM of ketoprofen + 1 µM of nifedipine.<br>
4. Discussion<br>
The study of this Example III evaluated the effects of nifedipine in combination<br>
with ketoprofen using bradykinin as an agonist to stimulate smooth muscle contraction.<br>
Bradykinin was used in the rat bladder tissue strip assay system (Examples I - III) to serve<br>
as an endogenous mediator of contraction. The overall pattern of inhibition seen with all<br>
combinations of nifedipine and ketoprofen concentrations was characteristic of non-<br>
competitive antagonism. Nifedipine, which prevents the influx of calcium ions through<br>
the cell membrane by acting on L-type voltage-dependent channels, attenuates the<br>
bradykinin receptor activated contraction of smooth muscle without directly inhibiting the<br>
receptor. As a single agent, nifedipine inhibition was shown above (Example II) to cause<br>
a reduction in the maximum bradykinin responses that were not accompanied by<br>
statistically significant changes in the agonist potency of the remaining response.<br>
This study revealed the surprising finding that the magnitude of the inhibition is<br>
greatly enhanced by the addition of ketoprofen at the lowest nifedipine concentration<br>
tested and is evident at all concentrations of the combinations tested. At low<br>
concentrations of nifedipine, this inhibition is more than additive, i.e., synergistic in<br>
nature. In contrast, ketoprofen treatment alone at the same concentrations was observed<br>
to not decrease maximal contractile tension, with no significant effect on the EC50 values<br>
for the nine combinations and no concentration dependence upon ketoprofen. Thus, this<br>
synergistic interaction on maximal tension and lack of strong effect upon the EC50 was<br>
an unexpected result based on the study of ketoprofen action when tested as a single agent<br>
in this test system.<br>
Taken together, these data indicate that the effects of the proinflammatory agonist,<br>
bradykinin, can be in part mediated by the simultaneous activation of L-type calcium<br>
channels and the induction of arachidonic metabolites that together augment smooth<br>
muscle contraction. While not wishing to be limited by theory, this effect may be due to a<br>
positive feedback loop that operates at a cellular and tissue level. Prostaglandins<br>

generated intracellularly as a result of bractykinin receptor activation may move to the<br>
extracellular environment, where they may interact and in turn activate prostanoid<br>
receptors subtypes. There are at least four known prostanoid receptor subtypes, termed<br>
EP1, EP2, EP3 and EP4. Of these subtypes, EP1 receptors are believed to be coupled<br>
through G proteins to stimulation of phophoinositide hydrolysis and/or PLC-independent<br>
influx of calcium. EP1 receptors have been previously identified in smooth muscle,<br>
where they can function to mediate contractile activity. Hence, the discovery of the<br>
combined synergistic actions of ketoprofen and nifedipine on contractile activity may be a<br>
result of simultaneous blockade of calcium mobilization and the concurrent inhibition of<br>
a positive-feedback loop involving PGE2 driven activation of prostanoid receptors.<br>
In conclusion, each combination of nifedipine and ketoprofen showed a greater<br>
inhibition of maximal bradykinin-induced contraction compared to either drug alone in<br>
the rat bladder tissue strip assay. Furthermore, the multiple combinations of nifedipine<br>
and ketoprofen tested allowed a response surface analysis to define optimal<br>
concentrations. A fixed ratio combination containing 3.0 µM ketoprofen and 1.0 µM<br>
nifedipine was identified that produced ~90% inhibition.<br>
Example IV<br>
Inhibition by Nifedipine and Ketoprofen of Multiple Agonist-Induced Contractile Tension<br>
and Release of PGE2 in Rat Bladder Tissue<br>
The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of ketoprofen and nifedipine<br>
on rat bladder contractility and agonist-stimulated PGE2 production using multiple<br>
agonists. Bradykinin, substance P, histamine and ATP are endogenous mediators that can<br>
be released as part of the acute inflammatory response and activate bradykinin receptors<br>
(B1 and B2 subtypes), tachykinin receptors (NK1-3) and histamine receptors (all subtypes)<br>
and purinergic P2X and P2Y receptors, respectively. Carbamylcholine is an agonist that<br>
may activate muscle and neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine subtypes or muscarinic<br>
acetylcholine receptors subtypes (M1-5) present in the bladder, while methoxamine is<br>
specific for α1-adrenergic receptors. The first objective was to evaluate the effect of<br>
ketoprofen (10 µM) and nifedipine (1 µM) individually, each at a fixed concentration, on<br>
contractile tension induced by each of the six agonists (bradykinin, substance P,<br>
carbamylcholine, methoxamine, histamine and ATP) in the rat bladder tissue strip model.<br>
The second objective was to determine the amount of PGE2 released from the bladder<br>
tissue in response to stimulation by each agonist in the presence of either ketoprofen or<br>
nifedipine during the same test conditions employed to measure contractile smooth<br>
muscle tension.<br>

1.	Methods<br>
Bladder tissue strips from Wistar derived rats were prepared, transduced and<br>
equilibrated using the bladder strip contractility method described in Example I above.<br>
Either 10 µM ketoprofen or 1.0 µM nifedipine was pre-incubated individually with the<br>
tissue for a period of 10 minutes prior to stimulation with the following agonists at a<br>
concentration equivalent to its respective ED75 for stimulation of tension: 0.03 µM<br>
bradykinin; 0.03 µM substance P; 3.0 µM carbochol; 30 µM methoxamine; 25 µM<br>
histamine; and 20 µM ATP. Antagonist activity for a given concentration of an<br>
antagonist (nifedipine or ketoprofen) was determined as the ability of that concentration<br>
of the antagonist to reduce the noted agonist-induced (e.g., 0.03 µM bradykinin-induced)<br>
response by 50 percent or more (&gt;50%). Each concentration of antagonist was tested in<br>
four separate tissue preparations.<br>
The effects of the two drugs on PGE2 release in response to multiple agonists was<br>
compared using the same 10 min pre-incubation protocol and a subsequent 30 min<br>
incubation period with agonist in the presence of the test compound. PGE2 produced<br>
after 30 minutes of treatment with each agonist (e.g., 0.03 µM bradykinin) in the absence<br>
and presence of the test compounds was determined. An initial 1.0 ml sample was taken<br>
from the tissue bath after a 30 minute incubation with the agonist. Subsequently, the<br>
tissue was washed using 10 ml of Krebs solution every 15 minutes for a 2 hour period.<br>
The test compound was added and pre-incubated for a period of 10 minutes prior to re-<br>
challenge with the same agonist. After an additional 30 minute period in the presence of<br>
the test antagonist and agonist, 1.0 ml was removed from the bath for analysis. The<br>
release of PGE2 from urinary bladder strips was measured using a specific enzyme<br>
immunoassay (EIA). Samples were frozen immediately and stored at -4°C until assay.<br>
The bladder strips were dried gently by blotting, and then weighed. Results are expressed<br>
as picograms of PGE2 released per milligram tissue.<br>
2.	Results<br>
All of the agonists investigated stimulated contraction of the bladder tissue strips,<br>
independent of their mechanism of action, demonstrating that multiple mediators can<br>
increase bladder smooth muscle contractile tension. Nifedipine (1 µM) produced a<br>
significant inhibition (&gt;67%) of each agonist-induced increase in contractile tension<br>
(FIGURE 11). The contractile response to bradykinin was affected by both nifedipine and<br>
ketoprofen (81% inhibition and 67% inhibition, respectively). In contrast, the increase in<br>
contractile tension induced by substance P, carbamylcholine and ATP was not affected by<br>
ketoprofen. Ketoprofen also only slightly reduced the tension for methoxamine and<br>
histamine (
-37-<br>
PH.1.0050.PCT.AP 03.17.06<br>
3/17/2006 3:58:27 PM<br><br>
Bradykinin evoked the largest increase in PGE2 relative to the other agonists<br>
tested. This evoked release was effectively inhibited by ketoprofen (81%) but minimally<br>
affected by pre-treatment with nifedipine (12%) (FIGURE 12). Thus, the extent of<br>
inhibition of smooth muscle tension by nifedipine was not linked to agonist-induced<br>
PGE2 responses and was distinct from the effect of ketoprofen. The absolute bladder<br>
levels of PGE2 produced in response to stimulation by other GPCR agonists were about<br>
10-fold less than those seen with bradykinin.<br>
In summary, the current study indicated that an increase in smooth muscle<br>
contractile tension can be induced by a variety of GPCR agonists in bladder tissue.<br>
Moreover, a common signaling mechanism for these agents is mediated in part through<br>
activation of L-type Ca2+ channels in the rat urinary bladder. Nifedipine's inhibition of L-<br>
type Ca2+ channels suggests an effective mechanism for inhibition of numerous<br>
pathophysiological mediators that can lead to increased smooth muscle bladder tension<br>
associated with spasm or hyperactivity. Ketoprofen inhibited bradykinin-stimulated PGE2<br>
production and release from the bladder while nifedipine did not exhibit an effect on this<br>
response. Thus, nifedipine and ketoprofen act through distinct mechanisms to inhibit<br>
smooth muscle contractile tension and release of pro-inflammatory prostaglandins in<br>
bladder tissue.<br>
Example V<br>
Effect of Ketoprofen and Nifedipine on Rat Bladder Function in an<br>
Acetic-Acid Overactive Bladder Model<br>
The primary objective of this study was to measure the effect of ketoprofen and<br>
nifedipine during intravesical, local delivery to female rats with overactive bladder<br>
function caused by perfusion with saline containing 0.2% acetic acid (acidified saline).<br>
Perfusion of 0.2% acetic acid through the bladder is known to rapidly induce an acute<br>
inflammatory state that is reflected in functional changes in bladder cystometry.<br>
1. Methods<br>
The method used in the current study represents an adaptation of a widely used<br>
acetic acid-triggered rat model of hyperactive bladder. In this model, acute inflammation<br>
of the bladder is produced by using 0.2% acetic acid in saline as the bladder perfusion<br>
fluid and cystometry under anesthesia is performed after a recovery period from the<br>
surgical procedure. A regular interval of voiding cycles can be seen for several hours<br>
after the initial stabilization period occurs. A bladder catheter connected to an infusion<br>
pump was used to deliver the drug solutions directly to the bladder at a constant, defined<br>
rate.<br>

The animals were anesthesized and bladder catheters were surgically implanted to<br>
allow irrigation of the test agents. The following cystometry parameters were monitored:<br>
mtercontraction interval (ICI), trigger pressure (TP), micturition pressure (MP) and<br>
micturition volume (MV) using a Med Associates Cystometry Station and software<br>
program. Only rats that displayed normal and stable cystometry profiles during the<br>
preliminary saline-infusion stage (not less than 15 min of baseline stabilization followed<br>
by 7 regular representative ICI intervals) were included in the study. Following the saline<br>
period, the rat bladder was infused with test agent in saline containing 0.2% acetic acid<br>
for 20 min followed by the collection of 7 representative ICI intervals for analysis. Due<br>
to the fixed concentrations of the irrigation solutions employed in the study and the use of<br>
constant perfusion rates for fixed constant times, a fixed, uniform dose of each agent was<br>
delivered to all animals.<br>
Groups of female rats were administered ketoprofen at selected concentrations<br>
(0.01-25 µM) alone or nifedipine at selected concentrations (0.1-10 µM) alone. Five to<br>
seven animals were normally tested in each group. Acidified saline served as the control.<br>
All infusion solutions were prepared fresh on the day of the experiment before use. For<br>
each of the test agents, three distinct bladder irrigation periods were employed: 1)<br>
baseline (saline only) for 1 hour; 2) drug in saline only for 15 minutes; and 3) drug in<br>
0.2% acidified saline for 1 hour.<br>
2. Results<br>
In the control animals, baseline levels of bladder contractions in response to a<br>
constant irrigation rate of 0.1 µl/min saline were established during the first hour<br>
following surgery. The time between contractions (ICI, seconds) and peak micturition<br>
pressure (MP, mm Hg) appeared to vary somewhat between animals but was fairly<br>
constant within animals following stabilization. Following the addition of the 0.2%<br>
acetic acid to the perfusion buffer, rapid contractions appeared, resulting in a significant<br>
decrease in the ICI. Increases in contractile pressure accompanied the shortening of time<br>
between the bladder contractions in many cases as well. These changes in functional<br>
bladder responses could be routinely measured following perfusion of the bladder with<br>
acidified saline, as shown in FIGURE 13. A 40-50% shortening of the ICI was typically<br>
seen in the control group in response to the 0.2% acetic acid irrigation (mean % ICI =<br>
58.4%±6.8%,n=8).<br>
Inclusion of ketoprofen in the irrigation buffer leads to a concentration-dependent<br>
inhibition of the shortening of the ICI (FIGURE 14). Complete inhibition was seen at<br>
approximately 3 µM ketoprofen and higher concentrations tended to go above 100% (data<br>
not shown).<br>
-39-<br><br>
Inclusion of nifedipine in the irrigation buffer also leads to a concentration-<br>
dependent inhibition of the shortening of the ICI (FIGURE 15). Complete inhibition was<br>
not seen but maximal effects appeared to be at 1 µM nifedipine, and higher<br>
concentrations tended to plateau at approximately 75% of baseline.<br>

Pharmacokinetics of Absorption of a Nifedipine and Ketoprofen<br>
Combination in a Rat Bladder Saline Model<br>
The primary objective of this study was to measure systemic -plasma levels of<br>
ketoprofen and nifedipine during and after the intravesical, local delivery of a<br>
combination of these drugs to rats. A secondary objective of this study was to determine<br>
the rate of appearance of ketoprofen and nifedipine when administered individually or in<br>
combination. Finally, a third objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of local<br>
drug delivery on the rat bladder tissue content of the pro-inflammatory mediator, PGE2,<br>
following surgical trauma to the bladder and subsequent intravesical perfusion of each<br>
agent or the combination.<br>
/. Methods<br>
The study included three main treatment groups of animals: a combination of both<br>
ketoprofen (10 µM) and nifedipine (10 µM); ketoprofen (10 µM) alone; and nifedipine<br>
(10 µM) alone. A bladder catheter connected to an infusion pump was used to deliver the<br>
drug solutions directly to the bladder at a constant, defined rate.<br>
For each of the three drug treatment groups, three distinct bladder irrigation<br>
periods were employed that were defined by the bladder perfusion solution for each<br>
period: 1) baseline (saline only) for 1 hour; 2) drug in saline only for 1 hour; and 3) post-<br>
drug saline period for 30 minutes (min). The animals were anesthetized and the dome of<br>
the bladders were surgically implanted with a catheter to allow perfusion of the test agents<br>
with an infusion pump at a constant flow rate of 100 ul/min. During period 1, saline was<br>
the perfusion fluid used and no plasma samples were collected. Starting at period 2,<br>
plasma samples were collected at time points of 0, 15, 30, 45 and 60 min following<br>
perfusion of test agents. Subsequent to 60 min of perfusion with test agents, only saline<br>
was perfused for an additional 30 min and two additional time points at t = 75 and 90 min<br>
were collected to determine the acute post-perfusion phase of test agents. Due to the<br>
fixed concentrations of the irrigation solutions employed in the study and the use of<br>
constant perfusion rates for fixed constant times, a fixed, uniform dose of each agent was<br>
delivered to all animals.<br>
Whole blood samples were collected into K2 EDTA tubes at the specified<br>
collection times. The volume of whole blood collected was approximately 0.2 mL per<br>
-40-<br>

sample. The blood was spun in a centrifuge and the plasma transferred into<br>
polypropylene tubes. Plasma samples were stored frozen at -80°C until shipment for<br>
analysis. Rats were euthanized by CO2 inhalation and the bladder was rapidly dissected<br>
and frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored frozen at -80°C until assayed for tissue PGE2<br>
content.<br>
The combination of ketoprofen and nifedipine was formulated in accordance with<br>
an aspect of the invention to include ketoprofen (10 mM), and nifedipine (10 mM) in a<br>
60% polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG 400):40% water solvent base, including 50 mM<br>
sodium citrate buffer for a pH 7.5 solution in a 5 mL glass vial. Immediately prior to use,<br>
the combination solution was diluted in the standard irrigation fluid at a ratio of 1:1000<br>
such that the final concentrations of the active drugs delivered directly to the bladder were<br>
each 10 µM. For these experiments, a fixed concentration ratio of 1:1<br>
nifedipine:ketoprofen was chosen, and final concentrations of 10 µM for each agent were<br>
maintained in the irrigation buffer.<br>
2. Results<br>
The study demonstrated a very low level of systemic absorption of ketoprofen<br>
following perfusion of the bladder with saline containing 10 µM ketoprofen for 60 min.<br>
In four out of six rats, a narrow range of Cmax between 4.3-5.8 ng/ml was seen at 60 min.<br>
At the 60 min time point, the perfusion with 10 µM ketoprofen was stopped and normal<br>
saline irrigation was continued for an additional 30 min period. For the group of four out<br>
of six rats which showed peak plasma levels of about 5 ng/ml, plasma levels decreased at<br>
75 and 90 minutes following cessation of ketoprofen perfusion. Delayed absorption<br>
during the 75-90 minute interval was observed in the other two animals in the ketoprofen-<br>
only group.<br>
For comparison, the ketoprofen levels were also determined for the combination<br>
of ketoprofen and nifedipine. The increase in systemic plasma levels was approximately<br>
linear over time during the initial 60 minute drug perfusion phase and the absolute mean<br>
plasma levels of 9.3 ng/ml (n = 6) at 60 minutes were well below the acceptable<br>
therapeutic daily dose of ketoprofen. As in the case of the ketoprofen only group, the<br>
perfusion with the combination was stopped and normal saline irrigation was continued<br>
for an additional 30 minute period. The mean ketoprofen values for all animals (n = 6)<br>
were not significantly different at 60, 75 and 90 minutes.<br>
A comparison of the mean plasma ketoprofen results are presented graphically in<br>
FIGURE 16 for the ketoprofen-only group and the combination group. The mean values<br>
(and standard error of the means, SEMs) clearly show the constant plasma levels for the<br>
combination after 60 minutes. Although small differences are apparent in the earliest<br>
phase of the time-course, no significant differences were observed either in the peak<br>
-41-<br>
PH.1.0050.PCT.AP 03.17.06<br>

levels or in the absorption kinetics for the ketoprofen plasma levels in the combination<br>
group versus the ketoprofen alone group after 30 minutes, or in the peak levels, indicating<br>
that no apparent ketoproferi-nifedipine drug interactions were present.<br>
The overall kinetic profile observed for nifedipine was similar to that observed for<br>
ketoprofen. In the nifedipine-only plasma group, nifedipine plasma levels increased<br>
linearly in 5/6 animals and some delayed absorption was observed in only 1/6 animals.<br>
The Cmax plasma level in the nifedipine group was in the range of 10.6-16.0 ng/ml at 60<br>
minutes for 5/6 animals. The mean peak plasma levels observed at 60 minutes were<br>
below the acceptable mean peak levels of 79 + 44 ng/ml that are obtained in man as a<br>
result of an oral therapeutic daily dose of nifedipine.<br>
The increase in nifedipine systemic plasma levels from the combination of<br>
ketoprofen and nifedipine also exhibited a linear increase with increasing time for the<br>
initial 60 minute drug perfusion period. The Cmax plasma levels in the combination group<br>
had a mean value of 18.2 ng/ml and values ranged from 8.2 - 34.6 ng/ml at 60 minutes for<br>
all six animals. The mean peak plasma levels observed at 60 minutes are about one fourth<br>
the mean peak levels that are obtained as a result of oral therapeutic daily dose of<br>
nifedipine.<br>
As shown in FIGURE 17, a comparison of the mean peak plasma concentrations<br>
of nifedipine (and plotted SEMs) shows the similar linear increase that occurs during the<br>
initial perfusion phase of intravesical delivery. No significant differences in nifedipine<br>
plasma levels were seen in the nifedipine only group when compared with the nifedipine<br>
and ketoprofen combination drug product group.<br>
At the end of the 90 min bladder perfusion period, bladders were harvested from<br>
the animals and subsequently the entire bladder was analyzed for PGE2 content using an<br>
enzyme immunoassay system. Data shown in FIGURE 18 are expressed as the mean of<br>
PGE2 using units of pg/mg protein + the standard error of the mean from six animals per<br>
treatment group. When animals were treated with nifedipine, bladder tissue PGE2 levels<br>
of 421 + 97 pg/mg protein (n = 6) were observed compared to statistically significantly<br>
(p 
the combination treatment group, 83 + 22 (n = 6) and 115 + 63 pg/mg (n = 5),<br>
respectively. No statistically significant differences were seen between the ketoprofen<br>
treatment or the combination treatment groups. In summary, ketoprofen treatment alone<br>
or treatment with the combination during bladder perfusion significantly inhibited PGE2<br>
formed in the whole bladder relative to the nifedipine treatment group.<br>
3. Discussion<br>
Using a method of intravesical perfusion for local drug delivery, the drugs tested<br>
in this study were directly in contact with the absorptive site within the bladder. The<br>
-42-<br>
PH.1.0050.PCT.AP 03.17.06<br>
3/17/2006 3:58:27 PM<br><br>
continuous perfusion maintained constant drug concentrations of either ketoprofen,<br>
nifedipine or the combination within the bladder during the period of drug delivery.<br>
Under these conditions, minimal systemic exposure to the drugs occurred in female rats<br>
during a 1 hour intravesical perfusion. Low levels of each drug were detectable within<br>
the first 15 min interval measured, and absorption progressed gradually as an<br>
approximately linear function over time of drug perfusion for each agent.<br>
The locally delivered drugs and drug combination were exposed to the structures<br>
of the bladder, including the uroepithelium, C-fiber afferents, efferents and smooth<br>
muscle. The data obtained in the study show that this action is local and cannot be<br>
ascribed to systemic effect that could be mediated through central nervous system<br>
mechanisms because the initial levels in the plasma for both drags tested are so low.<br>
Comparison of the plasma levels for each agent tested to known human levels<br>
associated with normal oral dosing reveals the magnitude of the difference observed. In<br>
the combination treatment group, the maximal levels for ketoprofen were about 400-fold<br>
less than the peak plasma levels (Cmax) in humans that are associated with the acceptable<br>
therapeutic daily dose of ketoprofen (rat mean ketoprofen plasma level of 9.29 + 2.13<br>
ng/ml at 60 min). For comparison, the accepted daily mean peak Cmax for a single 200 mg<br>
ketoprofen tablet (a single oral dose) is 3900 ng/ml. Similarly, peak levels observed for<br>
nifedipine were approximately 15 ng/ml to 25 ng/ml. The maximal levels (Cmax) typically<br>
occurred at the end of 60 min drug perfusion period or within the following 30 min<br>
sampling period. For comparison with known plasma levels from conventional oral<br>
dosing, the accepted daily Cmax for a single 10 mg immediate release nifedipine tablet is<br>
reported to be 79 + 44 ng/ml. Systemic exposure was comparable for ketoprofen plasma<br>
levels whether administered alone or with nifedipine. Similarly, nifedipine plasma levels<br>
were comparable whether administered alone or with ketoprofen.<br>
This study also determined the PGE2 content of the bladder for each of the<br>
treatment conditions in the study. An additional finding of significance is the long-lasting<br>
effect of ketoprofen that was measured in the assay of whole bladder PGE2 levels. The<br>
low concentrations of the ketoprofen treatment alone or the combination treatment during<br>
bladder perfusion significantly inhibited PGE2 formed in bladder tissue relative to the<br>
nifedipine treatment group. The PGE2 bladder tissue levels in the presence of ketoprofen<br>
were not significantly different from those following treatment with the combination.<br>
Because delivery of the drug was stopped at 60 minutes in this study, and then saline was<br>
used to irrigate for an additional 30 minutes, this showed that PGE2 inhibition remained<br>
active in the post-drug delivery period. Thus, ketoprofen demonstrated an extended<br>
period of anti-inflammatory activity in this model of local, intravesical drug delivery.<br>

In all three test formulations, 50 mM sodium citrate aqueous buffer was used. The target<br>
solubility of ketoprofen /nifidipine for F3/1, F10/3, and F30/10 were 3 mM /I mM, 10<br>
mM /3 mM, and 30 mM /10 mM respectively.<br>

2. Results<br>
In order to achieve complete dissolution of both actives, ketoprofen and<br>
nifedipine, in the formulatins, different percentages of PEG 400, 35% v/v PEG 400<br>
(F3/1), 50% v/v PEG 400 (F10/3), 60% v/v PEG 400 (F30/10), were used as a cosolvent.<br>
With the assistance of PEG 400 as a solubilizing agent, the approximate saturation<br>
solubility of ketoprofen and nifedipine in all three formulations was approximately 1.5x<br>
of their respective target solubility. The solubility results in Table 8 clearly indicate that<br>
PEG 400 is a suitable solubility enhancing agent for both drugs when it is desired to<br>
prepare highly concentrated combination solution formulations.<br>

2. Results<br>
FIGURE 19 shows an example chromatogram of the combination solution<br>
formulation F1 after stressing by storing at 60 °C for 1 month. The two active<br>
ingredients, ketoprofen and nifedipine, have a retention time of 24.19 minutes and 19.31<br>
minutes respectively. There are four main related substances with relative retention times<br>
(RRT) of 0.34, 0.58, 0.75, and 0.87 relative to the nifedipine peak. This stability data is<br>
summarized in Table 10.<br>
