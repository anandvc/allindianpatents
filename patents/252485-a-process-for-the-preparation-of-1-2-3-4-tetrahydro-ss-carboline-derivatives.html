				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the production of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-β-carboline derivatives.<br>
More particularly it relates This new process involves the preparation of various substituted tetrahydro-p-carbolines, by the Pictet-Spengler condensation of tryptamine with aldehydes catalysed by molecular iodine represented as:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein, R is C6H5, p-NO2C6H5, p-CIC6H5, p-BrC6H5, p-MeOC6H4, or benzopyranyl groups.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The tetrahydro-p-carboline moiety is a central feature of many indole alkaloids and natural products and the Pictet-Spengler condensation continues to be the most widely used method of synthesising this crucial tricyclic ring system. Numerous compounds from this class have received considerable attention because they show a broad spectrum of pharmacological activities. Tetrahydro-p-carboline template possess multiple sites for modification allowing it ideally suited to combinatorial elaboration. The World Drug Index for instance, contains over 200 listings of this heterocycle, which is usually assembled by the Pictet-Spengler reaction. Thus the synthesis of this heterocyclic nucleus is of much current interest. Combinations of various reactions with Pictet-Spengler condensation in a sequential/tandem fashion has been studied by several research groups and successfully utilized in organic synthesis.<br>

Hino, Tetrahedron Lett. 1986, 27, 3235._wherein the authors reported an efficient one-pot synthesis of acylated tetrahydro-β-carboline enroute to dimethoxyfumitremorgin C through<br>
..acvlation of the imine with Fmoc-L-proline and acid chloride. The drawbacks are the product is reported to form via a two-step one-pot reaction sequence in which the tetrahydro-p-carbolines were separated by chromatography subjected to removal of the Fmoc group with simultaneous diketopiperazine cyclisation, yielding the natural product and its epimer. (Scheme 1).<br>

Another reference may be made to R. Rill. Cesati, J. A. Katzenellenbogen, Organic Lett. 2000, 2, 3635.. wherein Katzenellenbogen reported a vinylogous Pictet-Spengler cyclisation as the key step aiming to prepare breast tumor imaging agents.<br>

Chem. 1988, 31, 1854. wherein the Pictet-Spengler reaction has also been employed as the key reaction in the preparation of Β-carboline-3-carboxylic acid esters which are active at the benzodiazepine receptor. The 3-substituted β-carbolines were prepared from 3-amino-β-carboline in one-step via diazotization, followed by reaction with the appropriate nucleophile in order to determine their binding affinity for benzodiazepine receptors. (Scheme-2).<br>

Also references may be made to a) J. P. Mayer, D. Bankaitis-Davis, J. Zhang, G. Beaton, K. Bjergarde, C. M. Andersen, B. A. Goodman, C. J. Herrera, Tetrahedron Lett. 1996, 37, 5633. b) P. P.

Use of 1 mol% trifluoroacetic acid/methylene chloride in polystyrene based supports exhibit excellent swelling properties in solvents. (Scheme 3).<br>

One-pot condensation of polymer bound tryptophan with a variety of aldehydes has been carried out under microwave irradiation to provide immobilized 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-p-carboline derivatives. The desired products were then liberated from the soluble matrix in good yields.<br>
Still another reference may be made to N. Srinivasan, A. Ganesan. J. Chem.<br>

Pictet-Spengler reaction of tryptamine and tryptophan methyl ester with aliphatic and<br>
aromatic aldehydes were performed in short reaction times with the aid of microwave<br>
irradiation.	The	drawbacks	are,	normally	the<br>
reaction needed one day or longer at room temperature. Also, the addition of 50 mol%  [bmin]CI-AICl3 N = 0.5, suggests that ionic liquids are additives for slow Lewis acid catalysed processes (Scheme 4).<br>

Pandit, Tetrahedron 1983, 39, 3981, wherein protic acid catalysed Pictet-Spengler reactions of tryptamine often feature harsher conditions and poor yields. So, most of these methods have their own merits as well as limitations.<br>
Therefore, a need still exists for versatile, simple and environmentally friendly processes, whereby tetrahydro-β-carbolines may be synthesized under mild conditions.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a novel, simple and effective molecular iodine catalyzed process for the production of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-β-carboline derivatives.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide 1 mol% of the catalyst to perform the synthesis.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to carry out the Pictet-Spengler reaction without effecting the substituents in the aromatic ring and without any side product formation.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to perform the reaction in one-pot and at ambient temperature.<br>
