DEVICE AND ELECTRONIC TOY USING DOT PATTERN<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a technique of optically scanning dot pattern information formed on a printed material and reproducing various kinds of information corresponding to the dot pattern information.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
Heretofore, there has been proposed a voice emitting toy for reading a barcode printed on a picture book or a game card using an optical sensor and emitting a particular voice. Such a voice emitting toy enables to read from a memory various kinds of voice information corresponding to a read barcode to reproduce the voice information.<br>
However, such a technique using a barcode requires a dedicated area on paper to be reserved for printing<br>
the barcode, and the barcode is only for an information<br>
» processing system to read, and a code description of the<br>
barcode can not be visually understood by a reader of<br>
a book including a picture book.  Since the barcode is<br><br>
printed on a limited paper space, a reader feels it unpleasant and the barcode sometimes may reduce a product value of a book including a picture book.<br>
Further, since the barcode, as mentioned above, can not be printed over letters, graphics or symbols printed on a paper sheet, when these letters, graphics, symbols and the like are used to reproduce voices, the barcode has to be printed near them, which presents a trouble such that it is difficult for a reader to intuitively know voice information or the like added on the letters or the like .<br>
Regarding this point, a "dot code" technique disclosed in the Japanese Laid-Open patent publication No.10-261059 proposes a method for scanning code information printed by a dot pattern to reproduce information.<br>
In the related art, data is defined by way for arranging a dot pattern in a block field, and a marker is defined by a dot pattern which is different from the data dot pattern to serve as a synchronization signal. According to this technique, a dot pattern created by printing dots in the two-dimensional direction on a paper sheet in accordance with a predetermined rule is read by a pen type scanner, and the scanning speed and the scanning direction of this scanner is analyzed by an information processing device thereby to reproduce information including a voice which is associated<br><br>
therewith in advance.<br>
However, since such a dot code technique is based on the assumption that dots are dynamically scanned by a scanner, although it can reproduce voice information along letters printed on a paper sheet, it is not adequate to reproduce information only by statically abutting a scanning device to a picture book or the like on which a character and the like are freely arranged and printed. In other words, since this dot code technique requires to carry out more than a predetermined distance of scanning on the x and y coordinates in order to obtain s igni ficant code information, it is impos s ible to associate a minimum area with a dot code and to print the area.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention proposes a dot pattern that allows to define code information or the x and y coordinates even if the dot pattern is an minimum area, and an information reproducing method and an information reproducing device based on the dot pattern<br>

scanning as image data by scanning means (602) a medium suchasaprintedmaterlal (606) on which is formed a dot pattern portion (607), the dot pattern port ion being formed by arranging in accordance with a given rule dots<br><br>
(605) generated by a dot code generating algorithm, in order to recognize various kinds of multimedia information; converting the image data of the dot pattern portion (607) into code data; and reading multimedia information corresponding to the code data out of storing means to reproduce the multimedia information.<br>
The multimedia information here may be any one of followings: voice information, image information, video information, and visible, audible and readable information such as a letter and a symbol.  Further, the multimedia information may be digital data for another personal computer, a television system or a radio terminal to reproduce video/image information, text information and the like.<br>
Here, on the dot pattern portion (607), code information corresponding to voice data registered in the storing means may be defined or the x and y coordinates may be defined. Also, both of the code information and the x and y coordinates may be defined. In a header of the dot pattern portion (607) , a flag may be registered to determine the dot pattern portion is code information or x and y coordinates.<br>
The medium may be a picture book or a photograph. The dot pattern portion (607) for recognizing voice information corresponding to image (606b) of the picture book or the like may be printed over the image (606b) .<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION Figs. 1(a) and 1(b) are block diagrams each showing a configuration of an information reproducing method using a dot pattern of the present invention and specifically, Fig. 1(a) explains generation of a dot code and Fig. 1(b) explains recognitionof a dot pattern.  Fig. 2 is an elevation view illustrating an example of a dot pattern and Fig. 3 is a functional block diagram for explaining a state of a picture book and the information reproducing method.<br>
The information reproducing method using a dot pattern of the invention includes generation cf a dot pattern 601, recognition of the dot pattern 501 and reproducing of voice information corresponding to the dot pattern 601.  Specifically, image data of the dot pattern 601 is scanned by a camera 602, which is scannina<br><br>
means, a distortion factor on the image is corrected, the image is converted into numeric values to be<br>
digitalized, the digitalized numeric values are divided into a first direction 633 and a second direction 604, its position is read, and voice information corresponding to the dot pattern 601 is then reproduced on a personal computer •; hereinafter referred to as "PC") 608, PDA, portable phone or the like.<br>
The camera 602 of Fig. 3 is configured by a pen type scanner, and an image pickup device such as CCD or C-MOS is integrated in the camera. However, the camera can be implemented by a digital camera or a camera mounted on a mobile terminal including a portable phone, as described later.<br>
Generation of the dot pattern 601 according to the invention is performed in such a manner that: in order to recognize voice information, smal1 dots 605 are arranged, by a dot code generating algorithm, in a first direction line 60 3 in accordance with a predetermine rule, and arranged in a second direction line 60 4 perpendicular to this first direction line 603 in accordance with a predetermined rule.  Then, a mapping table is also generated in a memory in the PC 608 or a memory provided in a camera 602.  This first direction line 603 and the second direction line 604 are not limited to those perpendicular to each other, however, they can be crossed forming an angle of 60 degree, for example.<br><br>
Recognition of the dot pattern 601 includes correction of a distortion factor by a lens of the camera 602, correction of a distortion caused by tile of the camera 602, reproducing of numeric information in the first direction 60 3 and reproducing of numeric information in the second direction 604.  The image data of the dot pattern 601 is captured by using the camera 602 which has an image pickup device such as a C-MGS camera and a CCD camera.  The pen type scanner may be replaced by a portable phone equipped with a camera or a camera connected to a portable phone.  In the case of such portable phones, control of a JAVA program and the like downloaded in a memory of the portable phone is utilized to reproduce a voice as it is.  The image data captured by the camera 602 is processed by an image processing algorithm to extract dots 605, which are subjected to correction of a distortion factor by a lens of the camera 602 by a distortion correcting algorithm.  Or, distortion by tilt of the camera 602 with respect to the dot pattern 601 is corrected.<br>
The image data captured by the camera 502 is processed by a CPU (central processing unit) of the PC 608 using a predetermined image processing algorithm to extract dots 605. Since distortion caused by the camera 602 itself is corrected by the distortion correcting algorithm. Therefore, even when image data of the dot pattern 601 is captured by a common camera 602 equipped<br><br>
with a lens high in distortion factor, accurate recognition is possible.  Also even when the dot pattern 601 is tilt with respect to the screen and scanned by the camera 602, the dot pattern 601 can be accurately captured.<br>
Reproducing of numeric information in the first direction 603 is carried out in such a manner that: two lines of the first direction 603 are extracted, dot information between the two lines of the first direction 603 is digitalized, a pattern thereof is recognized by a pattern recognizing algorithm and numeric information in the first direction 603 is reproduced using a mapping table.  In reproducing, if line reading can not be carried out accurately by smudges or noise, a next line is extracted and the same processing is performed.  Its information is recorded as numeric correcting information, which is used in correcting when the numeric informat ion is reproduced,<br>
Reproducing of numeric information in the second direction 604 is carried out in such a manner that: two lines of "he second direction 604 is extracted, dot information between the lines of the second direction line 604 is digitalized, a pattern thereof is recognized by a pattern recognizing algorithm and numeric information in the second direction 604 is reproduced using a mapping table. In reproducing, if line scanning can not be carried out accurately by smudges or noise,<br><br>
a next line is extracted and the same processing is performed.  Its information is recorded as numeric correcting information, which is used in correcting when the numeric information is reproduced.<br>
The aforementioned dot pattern 601 is configured of a dot pa::ern portion 607 printed on a printedmaterial 606 such ~s a picture hook and a text book. Image of this dot pattern portion 6C7 is recognized by the camera 602, corresponding voice information is read from a memory based on numeric data extracted from the image data, and corresponding voice and music are reproduced by output"! ng means such as a speaker 9 of the. PC 608, a PDA or portable phone.<br>
Figs. 4(a) and 4(b) are block diagrams each illustrating another configuration of an information reproducing method using a dot pattern and more specifically, Fig. 4 (a) a view for explaining generation of a dot code and Fig. 4(b) is a view for explaining recognition of a dot pattern.  Figs. 5 through 8 are elevation views each showing another example of a dot pattern.<br>
As mentioned above, image data captured by a earner* 602 is subjected to processing by image processing algorithm to extract dots 5. Since distortion caused by the camera 602 and distortion due to tilt of the camera 602 are corrected by the distortion correcting algorithm, accurate recognition is possible in capturing the dot<br><br>
pattern 601.<br>
In recognition of the dot pattern, first, a line composed by successive equally spaced dots 5 is extracted, and it is determined whether or not the extracted line is correct.  If the line is not correct, another line is extracted.<br>
Next, one extracted line is assumed as a horizontal line. This horizontal line is used as a basis to extract a line which extends vertically from the horizontal line. A vertical line starts from a dot which consists in the horizontal line and the vertical direction is recognized from the fact that the next dot or the third dot is not on the line.<br>
Finally, an information area is extracted and information thereof is converted into numeric values to reproduce this numeric information.<br>
Fig. 9 is an elevation view illustrating an example of printing of pictures of a picture book and story texts .<br>
In such a page, an icon 606a at the upper left side of the page is scanned by the camera 602 and a switch is turned on. Next, a text portion 606c printed of the story corresponding to the picture 6b is scanned by the camera 602. Since dot pattern portions 607 are printed on the icon 606a and the text portion 606c, these dot pattern portions 607 are used to recognize of which area, on which page of the picture book the information is and to make PC 608 reproduce correspondingly-stored voice<br><br>
of the story. For example, dots 5 of the dot pattern portion 607 is printed with a carbon ink while the other portion is printed with a non-carbon color ink so as to be scanned by irradiation of infrared light.<br>
Fig. 10 is an elevation view illustrating another example of a picture book on which pictures and story texts are printed.<br>
Fig. 11 is an elevation view illustrating still another example of a picture book on which pictures and - story texts are printed.<br>
The information reproducing method using a dot pattern according to the invention is not limited to a story based picture book, and can be applied to an educational material for teaching mathematics-' in an easily understood manner as shown in Fig. 10.  Also as illustrated in Fig. 11, the information reproducing method according to the invention can be applied to an educational material for teaching music in an easily understood manner.<br>
Stored in a memory of a PC 608, a PDA or a portable phone is a content which can be utilized as a picture book emitting music and conversation of central characters and the like as well as pictures of a picture book. Also can be stored are a content which can be utilized an educational material emitting a voice in combination with a toy such as assembly blocks and a content for storing which can be used as a dictionary<br><br>
software for translating by tracing words and text in a foreign language.<br>
The information reproducing method using a dot pattern according to the invention can be further utilized in the following way. "Pop picture book which generates voice"<br>
Taking advantage of. a feature that the camera 602 has only to scan or abut on the dot pattern portion 607, the information reproducing method according to the invention can be combined in a "pop picture book" which   , . makes a three-dimensional material appear when a page is opened.  After the page is opened, the dot pattern portion. 607 is attached to or printed on the inside of the three-dimensional material.  When this dot pattern portion 607 is searched and an end of the camera 602 is abutted to the dot pattern portion 607, various voices are outputted, thereby producing a "pop picture book which outputs a voice".  For example, when the page is opened, a "horror house" is opened by pop-up.  When a dot pattern portion 607 at a window is traced by the camera 602, a voice of scream of a woman such as "yipe" is reproduced.  When a dot pattern portion 607 at a hall is traced by the camera 602, a voice of ominous footstep such as "tap tap" is reproduced. "Creative picture book (creative book)"<br>
A dot pattern portion 607 can be attached to a desired portion of a picture book which is a printed material<br><br>
6. As the dot pattern portion 607 for a user himself to create content is attached, is can be used as a "creative picturebook (creative book) " which is able to set a switch anywhere. For example, a user can create an original story by attaching a dot pattern portion 607 of a set of a picture book, a speech collection, a sound list, sound source data and the like a dot pattern portion 607 of voice or music as a user like to the picture book 6.<br>
Further, a seal of a sound source list or an icon seal with a dot pattern. port ion 607 formed thereon is prepared, a user draws a picture on a picture book which has nothing drawn in advance, and then the user attaches the seal to the picture book to create an original story. With this configuration, a user himself can create a picture book which outputs a voice. "Educational material which outputs voice"<br>
The invention can be used as an "educational material which outputs a voice" dedicate'd for children, adults, aged people in any generation.  For example, an end of the camera 602 is abutted to a dot pattern portion 607 of a printed material 606 and the dot pattern portion 607 is scanned to reproduce a voice.  With such a configuration, the invention can be used as language education such as English conversation, child education such as intellectual education and music and teaching aid such as a drill.<br>
Since the invention can be used as an input interface<br><br>
printed on a printed material 606 or the like, it is<br>
possible to manufacture an interface suitable for each content.  Further, it is configured to download dot pattern data to the PC 608 via the general-purpose network such as Internet, when a user freely combines dot pattern data and prints a dot pattern on a paper sheet by a general-purpose printer, then, the user himself can create such a ""picture book which outputs a picture" as mentioned above.<br>
Further, URL information can be defined on a dot pattern portion 607 of the printed material 60 6 or another medium. When the URL information is extracted from image data obtained by taking a picture.of the dot pattern 607 by a camera 602, a browser program installed in the PC 608 accesses to the aforementioned URL to carry out a predetermined operation.<br>
Fig. 12 is a perspective view for explaining a touch panel with a dot pattern portion 607 formed thereon.  Fig. 13 is an exploded lateral view for explaining a touch panel with a dot pattern portion 607 formed thereon. A conventional touch panel is configured to be arranged on a monitor screen such as an LCD (liquid crystal display) or a CRT (cathode-ray tube) so that position input to the touch panel is carried out by pushing from above by a finger, a pen or the like following the instruction on the screen seen through.  This conventional touch panel has a pair of an upper electrode<br><br>
sheet and a lower electrode sheet, which have transparent electrodes of ITO or the like, arranged opposed to each other on a transparent film, for example/ with a spacer which serves as an insulator between the electrodes. Then, a transparent maintaining plate composed of a resin is bounded on a lower surface of the lower electrode sheet via a transparent adhesive layer. However, this presents defects of high cost and difficulty in use due to curling of the surface caused by long-time use.<br>
Then, in order to avoid high cost, a touch panel 612 which has a transparent film 611 with a dot pattern portion 607 printed thereon and a popular camera 602 (pen type scanner) are only used.<br>
This touch panel 612 is arranged on a screen of a monitor 613 such as an LCD (liquid crystal display) or a CRT (cathode-ray tube) of a PC 608 or the like. Then, tracing by the camera 602 is performed following the instruction on the screen thereby to perform position inputting. Thus, the camera 602 is faced to the touch panel 612 attached onto the monitor screen to capture image data of the dot pattern portion 607. Information corresponding to the dot pattern 607 is recognized on the monitor screen of the PC 608, and various voices or the like stored in the PC are reproduced correspondingly.<br>
Dots 5 of the dot pattern portion 607 have a characteristic such that it easily absorbs light when the main component is a carbon.  Unless a light beam from<br><br>
the monitor screen is cut off, the image data of the dot pattern portion 607 can not be accurately captured by the camera 602. Then, an infrared cutoff film 614 is arranged between the monitor screen and the touch panel 612 thereby to cut off infrared light emitted from the monitor screen. With this configuration, infrared light emitted from the inside of the camera is only treated as irradiation light, and light reflected from the dots 5 is easy to be recognized thereby facilitating recognition of the dot pattern portion 607, and it can be used as a touch panel of the PC 607.<br>
This touch panel 612 enables the camera 602 to be used as a pointer device.  Further, by recognizing points successively, it can be used as a trace device.  For example, if this touch panel 612 is arranged upward, it can be used as a conventional writing table for tracing.<br>
Here, the above-mentioned touch panel is explained as it is mounted on the monitor screen of the PC 608, however, it can be utilized on a display of a PDA, a screen of photographic seal distributor, a screen of an ATM terminal of a bank and the like.<br>
Fig. 14 is a cross sectional view illustrating another embodiment including a mouse type camera and a mouse pad with a dot pattern portion 607 formed thereon. Fig. 15 is an elevation view illustrating a mouse type camera.<br>
According to this embodiment, a camera 602 is<br><br>
integrated in a mouse-shaped case 615 and combined with a mouse pad 616, A semi-transparent mirror member 617 is mounted inside the mouse-shaped case 615 so as to recognize a surface of the mouse pad 616via a lower surface 615a of the mouse-shaped case 615 and a dot patternportion 607 with coordinate information printed on the mouse pad 16 is traced through an open window 618 mounted on the upper surface 615b of the case 615. A button 615c is provided near the window 618.<br>
The camera 602 in the mouse-shaped case 615 can be used, when recognizing a mouse pad 616, as an input device in place of a regular mouse. Specifically, the regular mouse can be used to input relative coordinates only, while the camera 602 further allows inputting of absolute coordinates .<br>
Figs. 16(a) and 16(b) show another embodiment of a camera integrated mouse-shaped case.  More specifically, Fig. 16(a) is a plan view thereof and Fig. 17(b) is a lateral view thereof.  Figs. 17(a) and 17(b) show yet another embodiment of a camera integrated mouse-shaped case.  More specifically, Fig. 17(a) is a plan view thereof and Fig. 17(b) is a lateral view.<br>
According to this embodiment, as shown in Figs. 16(a) and 16(b), the camera 602 is integrated in a protruding end 615d of the mouse-shaped case 615.  Since the protruding end 61 5d is thus formed in the mouse-shaped case 615, it is possible to position the mouse-shaped<br><br>
case 615 at a predetermined position of the mouse pad 616 with ease and to push a button switch 61 5e, and thereby to recognize a surface of the mouse pad 616 via the lower surface 615a of the mouse-shaped case 615.<br>
Here, it is also possible to provide a button switch 615f at the lower surface 615a of the mouse-shaped case 615. Only if the mouse-shaped case 615 is positioned at the predetermined position on the mouse pad 616 and the mouse-shaped case 615 is pushed against the mouse pad surface, the button switch 615f ca.n.be turned on.<br>
Fig. 18 is a cross sectional view illustrating another embodiment which utilizes as a tablet a printed surface on which a dot pattern portion 607 is formed.<br>
According to this embodiment, the pen type member 619 including a camera 602 is combined with a table 620 (or trace table) to use as a tablet a printed surface on which a dot pattern portion 607 is formed. A paper sheet 621 on which a dot pattern portion 607 is printed (printed surface) 621 is set on the table 620, a picture and letters are traced with this pen type member 619/ and the switch 622a is turned on thereby to capture data into the PC 608 or PDA. Further, an end of the pressure switch 622b protrudes from the end of the pen type member 619 .<br>
This pen type member 619 is used to write letters or draw a picture on a paper sheet on hand as is usually done.  Then, without looking at a display, written<br><br>
letters and drawn picture can be inputted to the PC 608 or PDA as the camera 602 recognizes information of voices and the like thereof. Accordingly, this pen type member 619 can be used for illustration, drawing, and also trace . Conventional ly it was necessary to look at a display when tracing by the mouse. However, this need is eliminated thereby to reduce burden in inputting. It is further possible to easily perform an operation which conventionally can be realized only by a coordinate inputting device called tablet.<br>
Fig. 19 is a cross sectional view illustrating another embodiment a camera mounted at an end of a pen type member.  Fig. 20 is a cross sectional view illustrating yet another embodiment a camera mounted at an end of a pen type member.<br>
The camera 602 mounted at the end of the pen type member 619 can be mounted swingingly thereon, as shown in Fig. 19. Since the camera 602 is thus swingingly configured, the camera 602 can be always placed vertically to a printed surface of the dot pattern portion 607, and there is no need to consider distortion caused by tilt of the camera 602 (pen type member 619).<br>
Fig. 20 is a cross sectional view illustrating another embodiment of the pen type member with a pressure switch mounted at the end thereof.  The switch 622 does not always have to be mounted on the pen type member 619. As shown in Fig. 20, the switch 622 can be mounted at<br><br>
the swingingly mounted camera 602.  With this configuration/ the switch 622 of the camera 602 has only to be pushed against a printed surface of the dot pattern portion 607 in order to turn on the button switch 622. Accordingly, the invention enables operation of the PC 608 instead of using a keyboard or a mouse regularly provided on the PC, and everyone can easily operate the PC 608 only by pushing.  Then, the invention serves as an interface which has a high affinity for human .  Beside , the invention, can be manufactured with a simple configuration and with low cost as compared with an inputting pad.<br>
However, the invention is not limited to the above-described embodiments. When the invention is configured to-recognize a dot pattern portion 607 on a printed material 606 or a transparent film 611 (touch panel 612) and to reproduce predetermined information and voices thereby to enables various ways of use, the invention is not limited to the above-described embodiments.  Besides, the invention can be modified without departing from the description of the invention.<br>
Figs. 21(a) and 21(b) are block diagrams each illustrating an information input ting/out put ting method by camera inputting according to the invention, and more specifically, Fig. 21(a) explains generation of a dot code and Fig. 21(b) explains recognition of a dot pattern. Fig. 22 is an elevation view illustrating an example of<br><br>
a dot pattern.<br>
The information inputting/outputting method by camera inputting of the invention includes generation of a dot pattern 1, recognition of the dot pattern 1 and means for outputting information and a program corresponding to the dot pattern 1.  In other words, a camera unit 2 is used to scan image data of the dot pattern 1 .  First, key dots 3 are extractedand then,, information ^ dots 4 are extracted.  The extracted dots aredigitalized to extract an information area, and thereby to be converted into numeric values.  The numeric information is based to output information and a program corresponding to the dot pattern 1.<br>
Generation of the dot pattern 1 according to the invention is performed in such a manner that small dots (key dot (KD) 3a, lattice dots (LD) 3b and information dots 4) are arranged in accordance with a predetermined rule by a dot code generating algorithm in order to recognize information. Recognition of dot pattern 1 includes correction of distortion rate by a lens of the camera unit 2, correction of distortion due to tilt of the camera unit 2 and reproducing of numeric information of a key dot 3a (KD) and information dots 4. Image data of the dot pattern 1 is captured by the camera unit 2 which includes an image pickup device such as a C-MOS camera and CCD camera.<br>
The above-described dot pattern 1 consists in a dot<br><br>
pattern portion 6 by printing at a wide variety of the printed material 5. Specifically, in the invention, the dot pattern portion 6 is printed on the same surface of the printed material 5 together with an information trans fer portion 7 represented by letters, illustrations or the like of which people is usually able to recognize information content visually, which is shown in Fig. 23. The information transfer portion 7 is preferably printed using a non-carbon ink. On the other hand, dots of the dot pattern port ion 6 are preferably printed with a carbon ink .<br>
In the information inputting/outputting method according to the invention, first, when the camera unit 2 is used to capture image data of the dot pattern portion ... 6, the dot pattern portion 6 is radiated with infrared light and thereby the dot pattern portion 6, of which the dots are printed in a carbon ink, is only scanned accurately separately from the information transfer portion 7 printed in a non-carbon color ink.  In other words, since information data of the dot pattern portion 6 is only captured from the printed material of which the information transfer portion 7 expressed by letters or figures and the dot pattern portion 6 are printed to be superimposed on the same surface, information of the dot pattern portion 6 can be only extracted.<br>
Fig. 23 is a view for explaining a dot pattern composed of x and y coordinate information.  Fig. 24 is<br><br>
a view explaining a method of recognizing and processing a dot pattern composed of x and y coordinate information.<br>
The dot pattern portion 6 of the invention is created by x and y coordinate information, and the x and y coordinate information and a content of the information transfer portion 7 can be associated with each other. Regarding the dot pattern portion 6, image data of the dot pattern portion 6 is captured using the camera unit 2 as explained above, and the image information is digitalized to be converted into numeric values.  The numeric values are expressed by the x and y coordinate information, which is then brought into correspondence with either position of the information transfer portions indicated by the round portion A, the square portion B and the triangular portion C.  At this time, using a reference table 1 on Fig. 24, the x and y coordinates are associated with each of the information transfer portions 7 .  In other words, correspondence is made between an x and y coordinate range and either content of the information transfer portions 7.  This is followed by referring a reference table 2 on Fig. 24 to output information or a program corresponding to the dot pattern portion 6.<br>
Withfcthe dot pattern portion 6 being made of the x and y coordinate information, only if the printed material 5 on which the dot pattern 1 is printed in advance is prepared and the information transfer portion 7 is<br><br>
printed to be superimposed on the printed material 5, it is possible to associate, for a certain content, the x and y coordinate range with information and a program of a voice or the like. In other words, since there is no need to create a new dot pattern portion 6 for a content of the information transfer portion 7, its versatility becomes extremely high.<br>
Fig. 25 is a view explaining a dot pattern made of code numeric information. Fig. 26 is a view explaining the procedure of recognition%and processing of a dot pattern formed of code numeric information.<br>
The dot pattern portion 6 according to the invention makes it possible to create code numeric information instead of the aforementioned x and y coordinate information and to associate the code numeric information with content of an information transfer portion 7. For example, the dot pattern portion 6 is printed out which includes code numeric information corresponding to the content of either of the information transfer portion 7 of the round portion A, the information transfer portion 7 of the square portion B and the information transfer portion 7 of the triangular portion C. The dot pattern portion 6 also has image data captured by the camera unit 2, as described above, which image information is digital!zed into numeric values (code numeric information) . Then, by referring to a reference table on Fig. 26, information and a program corresponding to<br><br>
the dot pattern portion 6 is outputtecL<br>
According to the dot pattern portion 6 with the code numeric information, a code number and content of the information transfer portion 7 are in direct correspondence with each other. Accordingly, as shown in Fig. 26, it is enough to make only one reference table. In addition, since only one reference table needs to be created, it is possible to shorten information processing time .<br>
Here, it is needless to say that a dot pattern portion 6 including x and y coordinate information and a dot pattern portion 6 including code numeric information can be printed on the same surface.<br>
Fig. 27 is an explanatory view explaining a state of image data of a dot pattern portion printed with a carbon ink being only captured by a camera separated from an information transfer portion of letters, figures or the like printed with a non-carbon color ink.<br>
As shown in Fig, 27, formed on a printed material 5 of white paper is an information transfer portion 7 printed with an ink which is transparent at infrared wavelengths but forms a color at visible light wavelengths, for example a non-carbon ink (dye ink). Next, formed on this printed material 5 is a dot pattern portion 6 printed with an ink which forms a color at infrared wavelengths, for example, a carbon ink such as a toner, infrared light ink, transparent ink or the like.<br><br>
These information transfer portion 7 and dot pattern portion 6 are superimposed to be printed on the same surface, which is then shot by a camera unit 2. At this time, an infrared light filter 2a cuts visible light wavelengths and makes only infrared light wavelengths pass. The camera can obtain information of the dot pattern 1 only. On the other hand, it is also possible to first print the dot pattern portion 6 before to print the information transfer portion 7 .<br>
This camera unit 2 recognizes at these dot pattern portions dots printed in accordance with a given rule, which dots are digitalized to be converted into numeric values.  Then, the numeric information is read, and informat ion or a program area on the printed material 5 corresponding to the dot pattern portion 6 is recognized. This is followed by outputting and executing various information and program correspondingly stored in a memory.  For example, information and program corresponding to the dot pattern portion 6 can be outputted by a text and image or a voice.<br>
The way of radiating a dot pattern portion 6 with infrared light can be adopted to capture only image data of a dot pattern portion 6 in the printed material 5 by the camera unit 2.<br>
According to the above-described method of the invention it is possible to output and execute various types of voice information via a medium of a printed<br><br>
material 5.  The invention can be applied to various printed materials 5, for example, a picture book, a pop-out book a photograph itself, questions, a text, a exercise book, a magazine, a newspaper, a card, a member card, a photo stand, an adhesive coated picture, explanation of a showpiece in a museum, card game, board game, pamphlet, catalogof mail orderandthe like.  Thus, it is possible to recognize both of visual information of the information transfer portion 7 including letters and illustrations in the printed material 5 aqd, voice information from the dot pattern portion 6.<br>
Fig. 2 8 is a functional block diagram for explaining a first embodiment of a portable information -inputting/outputting device using the information inputting/outputting method by camera inputting.<br>

The main body processing portion 11 includes the<br><br>
processing portion 9 for outputting and executing information and a program stored in advance in the storing portion (memory) 10 and corresponding to the dot pattern portion 6 based on the numeric values obtained by image processing at the image processing portion 12. This main bodyprocessingportionll includes an outputting portion 15 such as a speaker 14, earphones or an LC monitor 25. This outputting portion 15 can output, in addition to the voices, voice output (line), image to TV monitor or to a PC<br>
The storing portion 10 can store information and a program not only in advance but also can store them later. For example, the storing portion 10 can store information and a program from voices obtained by a microphone 17a as an inputting portion 17. In addition to the microphone 17a, this inputting portion 17 can be connected to a voice input terminal, an image input terminal, a PC and the like to store information and a program.<br>
In this way, since voices can be input later by using a microphone 17a, for example, the portable information inputting/outputting device is allowed to store voices of a user himself or acquaintances related to the printed material 5 such as apicture book storedvia the microphone 17, and later, the portable information inputting/outputting device can scan the printed material 5 so as for other people to listen to voice<br><br>
information corresponding to a content of the printed material.  For example it can be usedas a "family message device" or an "adhesive coated picture with voice message".<br>
The main body processing portion 11 can output or execute information and a program from the outside by being equipped with a communication cardl6. For example, a dot pattern 1 scanned by a camera unit 2 is converted into numeric values, which data then can be transmitted to a computer 23 such as a server via the communication card 16. In addition, a dot pattern 1 scanned by the camera uni t 2 is converted into numeric values, which data then can be transmitted to a computer 23 such as a server by using the communication card 16 before the main body processing portion 11 can receive information and a program corresponding to the data. The main body processing portion 11 can input data of numeric values into which the dot pattern 1 scanned by the camera unit 2 is converted, and receive corresponding voices. The communication card 16 is mounted on the main body processing portion 11 to store information and a program in the storing portion 10.<br>
Since the communication card 16 is thus used, it becomes easy to transmit and receive information and a program.  For example, the portable information inputting/outputting device is used to reply to questionnaires by voices and then the voice information<br><br>
is transmitted to the computer 23 such as a server.  Or, information of voices replying to questions or a test can be transmitted to the computer 23 such as a server thereby to carry out a pronunciation test or have responses to the questions or test corrected.<br>
Further, URL information is embedded in the dot pattern portion 6 of the printed material 5 or another medium so that when the URL information is scanned, connection toasideofthe URL information is established automatically.  Or, the connection being established, a particular action can be set to be performed.<br>
Or, a published matter which makes sound can be created. Voice information can be input in a post card or a letter later. For example, this printed material 5 can be added BGM (back ground music) , SE (sound effect) or the like, later.<br>
The main body processing portion 11 is further provided with a GPS 24 so as to display information of a current position easily.<br>

A camera unit A can no doubt be arranged at another desired position, for example, at the bottom portion, the chest portion, or at the legs.  The position where the camera<br><br>
unit A is arranged is determined depending on the kind of a stuffed toy 231, its size or the way of enjoying with the stuffed toy.<br>
However, the invention is not limited to the above-described embodiments.  The invention can adopt any configuration that enables various ways of use by recognizing only a dot pattern portion 6 on a printed material 5 to reproduce given information and voice. Modifications of the invention can be made without departing from the scope of. the invention.<br>
Next description is made about specifications of a dot pattern in the invention with reference to Figs. 103 to 106.<br>
A dot pattern 601 is configured of lattice-arranged dots, as shown in Fig. 105.  Lattice lines in the longitudinal and horizontal directions are shown only for explaining the position of dots, and they do not exist on the printed material in fact.<br>
Then, 4x4 lattice area is called a data block or lattice block, a lattice dot LD is arranged at each of four corners of this lattice block (intersections of lattice lines) . Aspacing between two lattice dots (LDs) is in the range of 0 . 3 5 mm to 1 . 0 mm, preferably around 0.5 mm. 3esides, the diameter of a dot is preferably 8 to 10% of the spacing between lattice dots.<br>
A Key dot (KD) is arranged in order to show from which block to which block one data ranges.<br><br>
The KD is at the position shifted from'a LD. In other words, a lattice dot is fundamentally arranged on a lattice point, while a KD is arranged shifted from the<br>
LD.  Here, shi ft of a KD from a lattice point is preferably about 20%.<br>
An area surrounded with KDs or an area having a KD as its center consists in one data piece.<br>
Arrangement of the data is made sequentially from the upper left to the downward direction, as shown in Fig. 104.<br>
The data can be, as shown in Fig. 103, defined by how far a dot 605 is shifted from the center point in a lattice block. In Fig. 103, eight points are defined as equally 45 degree shifted from the center, and thereby, eight kinds, or 3 bits data can be expressed in a single lattice block. Further, the distance from the center point is changed to define further eight points. Accordingly, as sixteen points are totally defined, four bit data can be expressed.<br>
A dot pattern of the invention has a feature in that lattice consisting in one data block can be defined freely. That is, since a KD defines a range of data area as mentioned above, if arrangement of KDs is changed, a lattice block group of any variable length can be treated as a data storing area.<br>
Besides, according to the invention, dot pattern portions can have different meanings by changing shift<br><br>
of a KD even if they are at the same position. In other words, a KD functions as a KD if the KD is shifted from the lattice point. If the way of shifting is changed so that KDs are equally 45 degree shifted from the lattice point, eight patterns of KDs can be defined.<br>
Here, when a dot pattern portion is shot by shooting means such as a C-MOS, the shot data is recorded in a frame buffer of the shooting means. If the shooting means is at the position rotated around the vertical axis (shooting axis) on paper, or the position (shifted* . position) turned around the shooting axis, the shifted amount (angle of camera) around the shooting axis of the shooting means is seen from the positional relationship between shot lattice dots and KD. The principle being applied, even if the same area is shot by a camera, it presents an angle as a parameter of another dimension. Therefore, even when the same area at the same position is scanned, other information can be output per angle.<br>
So to speak, angular parameter enables hierarchical information to be arranged in one area.<br>
Applications of this principle are shown in Figs. 74, 76and78. InFig. 74, a scanner portion 1105 provided at the bottom of a mini figure 1101, and the mini figure 1101 is turned by 45 degree on a base. Then, different-angle information as well as scanned information of a dot pattern portion can be obtained thereby to output eight types of voices.<br><br>
In the invention a dummy dot (DD) can be set. This DD is defined as a dot arranged at the right center of four lattice dots (LDs) (refer to Fig. 106(a) ) . Such a DD is suitable for a picture book or the like in which a boundary is defined in every mask area. As shown in Fig. 106(c), a DD is arranged at the boundary between mask 1 and mask 2. Such arrangement of a DD area at a mask area prevents simultaneous scanning of code information defined at mask areas. Fig. 106(d) shows arrangement of DDs.<br>
Preferably, an empty dot in which no dot is arranged at the center of lattice dots is arranged in a background portion of a picture of the like. Since an empty dot is small in number of dots compared with normal data dot on which information is recorded, it is possible to print with indistinctive dots. In addition, since successive empty dots prevent patterning, they are suitable for whole-colored back ground.<br>
Further, according to the invention, it is necessary to analyze data of one block including shooing center. However, lattice data (information data) at several blocks in the vicinity of shooting center can be set as scanning data.  In this case, data corresponding to information data lacked in one original block is read from another adjacent block, with which original one block data can be complemented to complete input.<br>
Regarding a data pattern which define x and y<br><br>
coordinates, a block different from the block at the shooting center is utilized to read information dots composing corresponding x and y coordinates, which is then subjected to correction to be x and y coordinates at the shooting center.<br>
The invention has a feature of not being affected much by shooting conditions since a dot pattern using lattice dots are utilized as described above. In other words, when the whole dot pattern is distorted due to the shooting conditions (distorting of lens of a camera, shooting angle of camera, change in shape of paper), position shift of a shape formed of four lattice dots and information dots are equally made, relative position from the lattice dots are not changed and if correction calculation is performed on the basis of these lattice dots, the real position of each information dots and key dots can be known.<br>
That is, a dot pattern using lattice dots according to the invention is resistant to distortion.<br>
Figs. -61 to 67 are views for explaining a method for scanning a dot pattern corresponding to one block composed of sub blocks by a camera using a preferred embodiment of the invention of a dot patter inputting method by a-camera of the invention.<br>
As shown in Fig. 61, a camera includes: an LED for radiating an object with light; an LED acrylic filter for filtering light output from the LED; and a visible<br><br>
light filter (infrared transparent filter) for filtering reflected light from the object.  A tube housing the camera is approximately 10 mm in the longitudinal direction.  If the diameter of the imaging area of a dot patter is 10 mm, when one block of 4 mm x 4 mm dot pattern (II to 116) is scanned, an imaging area of 2r = 2 x 4V2 = 11.28 mm at the maximum is required (refer to Fig. 62) . In order to solve this, sixteen information dots to be arranged around a key dot of one block are not scanned sequentially, but they are scanned by four information dots (1/4 block (sub block)) having information independent from other information dots.  With this configuration, instead of information dots in 1/4 block out of the imaging area, corresponding information dots (1/4 block) in another block in the imaging area are input thereby enable one block information to be input within the imaging are of the diameter of 10 mm.<br>
When there occurs an error in either 1/4 block input by the above-described method, corresponding information dots in another block (1/4 block) are input to correct the error.<br>
In Fig. 64, the, imaging center of a camera is I8 in Bl block, and [Ii to lie] in Bl block nearest the center of the camera are input.<br>
In Fig. 65, the imaging center of a camera is I5 in Bl block, and [Ii, I2/ I3/ I4 ] and Us/ Ie/ I?, Is] in Bl block and [I9, I10,   In, I12] and [I13/ In, I5/ lie] in<br><br>
B2 block nearest the center of the camera are input-In Fig. 66, the imaging center of a camera is I6 in Bl block, and [I5/ Is, I7/ Is] in Bl block, [I9, I10, In. I12] in B2 block, [I13, In, Is/ lis] in B3 block and [Ii, Izf I3/ I4] in B4 block nearest the center of the camera are input.<br>
In Fig. 67, the imaging center of a camera is I7 in Bl block, and [I5/ I6, I7, Is] and [I9, 110/ In/ 112] in Bl block and [Ii, I2, 13. Id and [Ii3/ In, I5/ lie] in B4 block nearest the center of the camera are input. In Figs. 64 to 67, when there occurs an error in input dot pattern, there are eight 1/4 block dot patters at the maximum-that can be input alternatively.<br>
A dot pattern"according to the invention as described above is printed on a printed material such as a picture book, a text and the like, the dot patter is captured as image data by the camera, and image data is digitalized into numeric values thereby outputting information and a program corresponding to the numeric values by a PC, an information outputting device, a PDA, a portable phone or the like.<br>
Next, the principle for scanning dots and a configuration of a device therefor are described with reference.to Figs. 107 to 113.<br>
Reflection of light includes specular reflection and diffuse reflection that occur at a given ratio on the surface of an object by characteristic of the surface.<br><br>
The spec -r reflection is, as shown in right figure of Fig . 110, .flection of light incident on a flat and smooth surface an object in such a manner that the incident angle ar. "he reflection angle are the same. Particul iy, when the surface is smooth, a specular reflect; factor is increased, reflection of light is heavy, a i there occurs a highlight.<br>
The iiffuse reflection is as shown in left figure of Fig. 1 : 3, such that light incident on a minutely rough surface is diffused in every^direction and reflected. In this diffuse reflection, light at a given wavel.ength determined by a characteristic of the object surface is absorbed. Accordingly, when a paper surface is rough like boni paper or mat paper, a carbon ink included in a printed dot 605 absorbs incident light by the LED 2022 and the light is not reflected. Then, the dot 605 is mapped by a C-MOS camera 202 (refer to left figure of Fig. Ill, ) . However, when dots are printed on paper of a flat and smooth surface such as coat paper or art paper, a film, plastic or the like, or the surface of printed dots is coated or covered with a transparent film, there occurs specular reflection. In this case, a carbon ink does not absorbs light of the LED 2022 and becomes a highlight, and accordingly, the dot 605 is not imaged by the C-MOS camera 202 (refer to right figure ofFig.lll,). In other to avoid this, as shown in Fig. 107, the LED 2022 is arranged at the position at which direct light<br><br>
from the LED 2022 is not specular-reflected to be input to the C-MOS camera 202, that is, the position near the C-MOS camera, and light from the LED 2022 is reflected against the inner wall 2021 not to occur a highlight.<br>
Also, as shown in Fig. 108, light from the LED 2022 is made to pass a filter 2023 such as an acrylic filter to diffuse the light equally on the paper, thereby to present highlight from occurring. Further, as shown in Fig. 2023, an acrylic filter 2023 may be mounted to coat around an LED 2022 .<br>
Figs. 112 and 113 are views each for explaining inner configuration of an end portion of a pen type scanner which realizes such ideal arrangement of C-MOS camera and an LED 1122.<br>
In Fig. 112, a nose portion 1125 with a long tapered end is engaged with a tube case 1124. The nose portion is movable in the axial direction, and movement of the nose portion is biased by an elastic member 1121 such as a spring or rubber provided on a protruding wall on the inner surface of the nose portion 1125. The protruding wall is equipped with a C-MOS camera, a lens 1126 mounted on the center of the C-MOS camera is arranged to see through an opening of the end of the nose portion<br>
so that the camera can image reflected light passing<br>
■* 
through the opening. At the lens 1126 side, an LED 1123 (2022) equipped with a filter 2023 is provided, as shown in Fig. 109.  This LED 1123 is provided at the back of<br><br>
lens face of the lens 1126 in the tube case 1124 so that light from the LED 1123 is not input directly to the lens face .<br>
The protruding wall is provided with a switch 1123 for electrically conducting to an electric circuit by pressure. When the nose portion 1125 moves in the direction of the tube case 1124 against biasing of the elastic member 1121, a base portion of the nose portion 112 5 pusses the switch 1123 to start operation.<br>
By actuation of the switch 1123, the LED 1123 is brought into an irradiating state thereby to start scanning processing by the C-MOS camera.<br>
Since the end of a pen type scanner is configured as shown in Fig-; 112, assembly is completed only by inserting the nose portion 1123 to the tube case 1124 thereby improving assembly efficiency.<br>
Further, Fig. 113 shows another configuration of an end of a pen type scanner. In the configuration on Fig. 113, the nose portion 1125 is connected via the rubber (elastic member) 1132 by an adhesive agent. Further, the switch 1123 is arranged at a given position inside of the rubber 1132 so that the base portion of the nose portion 1125, which is biased to be moved against elastic force,,pushes the switch 1123.<br>
Furthermore, LEDs 1131 are arranged via respective acrylic filters 1133 near the lens 1125 of the C-MOS camera. When the switches 1123 are actuated, radiated light of<br><br>
the LEDs 1131 is outputted via the acrylic filters 1133, through the opening of the nose portion 1125 to the outside.<br>
Fig. 68 to Fig. Ill show further modifications of the embodiments.<br>
Fig. 68 is a view of a camera which is housed in a pen shaped case (device main body) 1015 as a pen type scanner 1001.<br>
The case 1015 includes a battery 1016, a speaker 1007 and a circuit board 1011,.which are mounted therein. A central processing unit (CPU) and a memory are implemented on the circuit boar 1017 in such a manner that their surfaces are fully attached to the board.  A microphone (not shown) maybe integrated.  In addition, at the rear end of the case 1015 (upper right side of the figure), a memory cartridge 1014 is inserted detachably.  This memory cartridge 1014 is configured to register a program, existing voice data or the like. The memory cartridge 1014 is provided replaceably, can be replaced with a ROM cartridge, a micro unit cartridge or the like.<br>
On the surface of the case 1015 buttons 1130a to 1130c are provided for controlling start of scanning, start of recording, voice reproducing and the like.<br>
Among the buttons, when the recording button is pushed, a microphone (not shown) can be used to record voices.  The recorded voice data is stored in the memory<br><br>
cartridge 1014.  At this time, when the dot pattern portion is scanned while the recording button being pushed/ recorded voice data is allocated to the dot pattern portion.  When the dot pattern portion is scanned while the deleting button being pushed, allocation of the voice data to the dot pattern portion can be cancelled. Then, the voice data may be left stored in the memory cartridge 1014.<br>
In the figure, in the end of the case 1015 (lower left side of the figure), as the case 1015 is abutted on a medium surface while being inclined by about 4 5 degree, a C-MOS camera unit, a spring 1121 and a tapered nose portion 1125 are provided along the vertical axis of the medium surface. When the case 1015 is pushed in the ; direction of the medium surface, the nose portion 1125 moves backward against biasing of the spring 1121 and then the switch 1123 is pushed on.<br>
Inside the nose portion 1125, a lens 112 6 of the C-MOS camera unit is mounted to command the inside of the nose portion 1125 so that the lens 1126 can take an image of a window of the end of the nose portion.<br>
Inside the nose portion 1125, an irradiation tube 1127 is provided which has two crank-shaped 45-degree bent portions.<br>
The irradiation tube 1127 is configured of a cylindrical member of transparent resin and an end face thereof is faced with an LED 1122 so that a radiated light<br><br>
beam from the LED 1122 is input into the irradiation tube. Inside the irradiation tube, a diffused component of the radiated light beam (an optical component of which the angle with respect to the optical axis is larger than 45 degree) passes the inner surface of the irradiation tube to be output to the outside.  On the other hand, a straight-traveling component of the radiated light (an optical component of which the angle with respect to the optical axis is smaller than 45 degree) is reflected on the inner surface of the irradiation tube to proceed in the tube.  In the radiated light, only a component approximately parallel to the optical axis in the irradiation tube is output from the end face toward the opening of the nose portion 1125.<br>
Since the radiated light passes through the crank-shaped irradiation tube made of transparent resin to become focused light parallel to the optical axis, it is possible to provide an even amount of light over the whole area of the opening of the nose portion 1125. Thus, according to the present embodiment, there does not occur peripheral darkness in the case of diffused light, thereby enhancing the accuracy of scanning the dot pattern portion 607.<br>

is abutted on the seal surface to input the voice data.<br>
Fig. 102 is a view showing an example of an organizer 1701 and a pen type scanner 1001 which are combined to be used.<br>
In Fig. 102, a dot pattern portion 1122 is formed in advance in a schedule section 1702 of the organizer 1701. In registering a schedule in the schedule section 17 02, if a person can not afford recording letters on the way, an end (scanner portion 1105) of the pen type scanner 1001 is abutted on the schedule section 1702 of the date at which the schedule is input, and a schedule of the date is input by voice from a microphone (not shown) .<br>
In checking the schedule on the organizer 1701, the pen type scanner 1001 (scanner portion 1105) is abutted on the schedule section 1702 of the checked date to scan the dot pattern portion 1122. Thereby, the schedule input by voice corresponding to the date is reproduced from the speaker 1007.<br>
Here, the pen type scanner 1001 is configured to be connectable to a PC 1201 by a USB interface or the like and establishes data like (synchronized) with a schedule managing system in the PC 1201 (for example, Outlook of Microsoft Corporation, Lotus Note or the like) .

data as shown in Fig. 102.<br>
When the pen type scanner 1001 may be connected to the PC 1201 and the dot pattern portion formed on the surface of the organizer 1701, an ID card, a license card or the like to control inputting of the PC 1201. Such a control of the PC 1201 is called "paper icon", an icon on the screen of the PC 1201 can be replaced with an external medium on which a dot pattern portion 1122 (seal attached to the organizer 1701, ID card).<br>
In other words, the pen type scanner 1001 is used to scan the dot pattern portion 1122 on the medium, and only if code information scanned from the dot pattern portion 1122 matches code information stored in the PC 1201, access to the PC 1201 is permitted.<br>
The dot pattern portion 1122 may be printed on a seal, as a paper icon which is attached to a surface of the organizer 1701, an ID card or a license card. Or, a user may print it by a printer connected to the PC 1201 and hold printed seal.<br>
Here, a paper icon on which the dot pattern portion is formed is used to control access to the PC 1201. However, it can be used to input an ID or password in starting a particular application or accessing to a particular internet site.<br>
Such paper icon can be managed by an application program for paper icon installed on the OS of the PC.<br>
Specifically, management is configured of three<br><br>
steps of "icon registration on PC", "paper icon registration" and "icon deletion". <registration of normal icon><br>
An application program for paper icon on a PC has an editor thereby to create and set a paper icon on a screen.<br>
When, in the icon editor, an icon for executing a predetermined function on the PC is registered on the editor, first, icon allocation (ALLOCATE) is turned"ON". Next, a desired icon on the PC screen is designated by a mouse, and the icon is registered on the editor.<br>
The icon thus registered on the editor is set in an initial state in which display is "ON" and Executable state (active) is "ON".<br>
In this state, on the editor, when the display is turned "OFF", the icon is erased from the display.  When the executable state (active) is turned "OFF", designation and execution of the icon on the PC and execution of keyboard inputting are inabled. Registration of paper icon&gt;<br>
In the editor, allocation of paper icon (ALLOCATE) is turned "ON".  Next, the icon on the display is turned "ON" to scan a medium of the paper icon, which is desired to be registered, by a pen type scanner or the like.<br>
By the above-described operation, a code of a dot pattern of the scanned paper icon is registered on a selected icon (allocated).<br><br>
In the initial state of the paper icon, the executable state (activate) is "ON" and a password can be inputted.  Then, the password is inputted, the password is encoded by an editor program and registered.<br>
In this state, when the executable state (active) is turned "OFF', even if the paper icon is scanned by the pen type scanner, a function defined on the icon can not be executed. <deletion of icon><br>
When a deletion flag (DELETE) is turned "ON", an executable state (active) is simultaneously turned "OFF" . Then, the icon image flag is designated in this sate, the icon is deleted and no longer - recovered. <deletion of paper icon><br>
Also in deletion of paper icon, when a deletion flag (DELETE) is turned "ON", an executable state (active) is simultaneously turned "OFF".  Then, code number assigned to a paper icon is designated in this state, a password is required to be inputted.  When the password is input, a link to the paper icon on an editor is deleted and no longer recovered.<br>
The dot pattern portion 1122 can include, in addition to a medium of a picture book described in the embodiment, a normal book, a greeting card, a newspaper, a wish book, a pamphlet, a paper craft, an origami and a recipe.<br>
For example, a dot pattern portion is formed on a<br><br>
wish book. Then, the dot pattern portion is scanned by a scanner portion to output explanation of goods or to start an order program registered in a memory in a PC.<br>
Further, a dot pattern portion is formed a paper craft or an origami. Then the dot pattern portion is scanned by a scanner portion to explain fabrication process of the paper craft and the origami via a speaker.<br>
Further, a dot pattern portion is formed on a recipe of cooking or the like, and the recipe can be output by voice.<br>
Furthermore, a dot pattern portion according to the invention is used to provide a picture book for coloring. Specifically, areas (mask areas) shown in Figs. 106(b) and 106(c) can be colored with different colors by crayon, felt pen, water-color pigment or the like. In this case, even if a non-carbon water-color pigment, crayon, felt pen or the like is used to color the paper on which the dot pattern portion is formed, as infrared light is capable of passing through the colored layer, the dot pattern portion can be scanned.<br>
Furthermore, the dot pattern portion and a barcode reader can be superimposed to be printed. In this case, a barcode is printed on a medium such ash paper with a non-carbon ink, and on the printed barcode, the dot pattern portion is printed with a carbon ink. A normal barcode reader is capable of reading a barcode accurately even a small dot is on the barcode.  Next, a pen type<br><br>
scanner according to the invention is used to input only a reading information code of the dot pattern portion.<br>
Further, a barcode is printed with a ink which absorbs "(A) visible light + infrared light or ultraviolet light close in wavelengths to the visible light" or " (B) infrared light or ultraviolet light close in wavelengths to the visible light", while dots are printed with a ink which absorbs "(C) infrared light or ultraviolet light different in wavelengths from the infrared light or ultraviolet light used in the barcode" .<br>
In this case, a visible light cut-off filter is mounted on a C-MOS camera, a first LED for emitting light with the same wavelength as that of the above-mentioned (A) or (B) is made to emit light so  as to read a barcode. Next, a second LED for emitting light with the same wavelength as that of the above-mentioned (C) is made to emit light so as to read only a dot pattern portion and input information code.  In this way, since information from the dot pattern portion is arranged on the barcode, convoluted information (barcode and code from the dot pattern portion) can be acquired.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
A dot pattern portion of the present invention is usable by being formed on publications including a book and a picture book, a picture seal, a seal with a dot patter for inputting formed on, a picture seal, a game<br><br>
board, character goods including a figure-and a stuffed toy and touch panel of a monitor screen of a personal computer, television or the like.<br>
A reading system of a dot pattern portion can be utilized as an inputting system of a toy computer area for children and a general purpose computer.<br>
Further, the system is housed in a case to be used as a stand-alone scanner in an electronic device, a voice recorder and the like.<br><br><br>
