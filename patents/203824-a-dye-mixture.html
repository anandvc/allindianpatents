REACTIVE DYE MIXTURES This invention relates to a dye mixture.<br>
This invention relates to mixtures of reactive dyes, in particular to mixtures of reactive dyes containing, as one component, a disazo dye derived from K-acid.<br>
As is well known, reactive dyes contain at least one substituent capable of taking part in a reaction with a group present on a fabric to be dyed during the dyeing operation.<br>
EP-A-0149170 discloses a range of dyes of the formula<br><br>
in which one X is hydrogen and the other sulpho, each of Y1 and Y2 independently is a group -CH=CK2, -CK2CK2OSO3H, -CK2CH2SSO3H, -CK2CH2C1 or -CH2CH2OR, and R is a low molecular weight alkanoyl, benzoyl or benzenesulphonyl group, optionally substituted by a C1-4 alkyl, C1-4 alkoxy, nalogen, carboxy or sulpho group.<br><br>
2<br>
A  typical  dye has  the  formula<br><br>
EP-A-0149170   refers   only  to  individual  dyes,   not  mixtures<br>
thereof.<br>
On the other hand, each of EP-A-0224224, EP-A-0679697, EP-A-0531968, EP-A-0668328 and EP-A-0600322 discloses respective mixtures of dyes, one of which components as a disazo dye derived from H-acid.  One particular example of such a dye has the formula<br><br>
This dye is available commercially as C.I.Reactive Black 5 and is added to other dyes as a dulling agent where appropriate.<br>
We find surprisingly that the fastness of a dye mixture can be improved if the dye mixture contains, as a component<br><br>
3<br>
thereof,   a dye of  the  formula   (A)<br><br>
wherein  each of Y1  and Y2,   independently/   is  a vinyl  group or  a  group of the  formula -CH2CK2Q in which Q  is   a  leaving group  removable under alkaline  conditions  to  provide  a vinyl   group.<br>
The  dye mixture may contain,   in addition  to  component   (A) , any of  a wide range of dyes.<br>

from 20 - 90% by weight, inclusive, of component (A) and from 10 - 80% by weight, inclusive, of component (B) ;<br>
from 30 - 90% by weight, inclusive, of component (A) and from 10 - 70% by weight, inclusive, of component (B) ; and<br>
In an especially preferred mixture, component (B) is a mixture of dyes (B) .<br>
Mixtures embodying the invention can be prepared by merely mixing the individual dyes or, m some cases, by synthesis using a mixture of diazotising components. This method is especially suitable when component (B) is at least one dye of the formula (V) .  The dye mixture may be isolated, for<br><br>
41 example, by spray drying or salting out.<br>
The mixtures can be used to dye or print on substrates containing a hydroxyl group or nitrogen atom, for example, silk, leather, wool, polyamides, polyurethanes and cellulosic materials, especially cotton.<br>
The mixtures provide excellent properties including resistance to modern peroxide based detergents, fastness to repeat washing, good light fastness, excellent wash-off, good build-up, good compatibility of the dyes with one another and a robustness to process variables.<br>
The reactive dye (A) alone gives a navy shade on cotton and may be mixed with at least one yellow, orange, red or blue reactive dye (B) to give a forest green, navy, brown or black shade.<br>
The mixtures have outstanding properties in comparison with known mixtures, for example CI Reactive Black 5, referred to above, which is often used in a mixture with other dyes as a dulling agent.<br>
Preferred embodiments of the invention will now be described in more detail with reference to the following Examples, in which the numbers assigned to the dyes are -those given in Table 2 and all parts are by weight unless otherwise stated.  In the Examples, dye A has the formula<br><br><br>
42<br>
Example   1:<br>
75 parts of dye (A)1, 20 parts of dye (167) and 5 parts of dye (163) were mixed. The mixture was used to dye cotton, by application of cold pad batch and warm exhaust (40, 50 or 60°C) techniques as described below, xn a navy shade resulting in   good  light   fastness   and  fastness   to   repeated  washing.<br>
Exhaust  application:<br>
l00g of cotton fabric were dyed in a dyebath that contained 1000 mi water, 12g of the mixture of Example 1, 2. 5g sodium carbonate, 1g 32 weight% sodium hydroxide solution and 60g sodium sulphate decahydrate. The dyeing was started at 30°C, the temperature was raised to 50°C over a period of 30 minutes and the dyeing was continued for a further 60 minutes at this temperature. After cooling to room temperature the dyeing was rinsed and boiled with detergent,   and  dried.<br>
Cold pad-batch application:<br><br>
43<br>
At room temperature woven cotton fabric was scaked in a padder with dye liquor that contained per l000g dye liquor 60g of dye mixture of Example 1, 50g sodium silicate (38° B'e) and 30g 32 weight% sodium hydroxide solution. After 70% pick-up the paddings are rolled and covered with cling film.  After storing for 8h at room temperature the paddings are removed from the cling film, rinsed in cold water, hot rinsed with detergent, and dried.<br>
Example 2:<br>
60 parts of dye (A)"-, 24 parts cf dye (44) and 16 parts of dye (105) were mixed mechanically.  The dye mixture was applied to cotton using the application and fixing methods of Example' 1, resulting in a black shade providing outstanding fastness properties.<br>
Example 3:<br>
Dye (A)1 and dye (53) were synthesised separately according to known procedures.  65 parts of reaction solution of dye (A)1 and 35 parts of reaction solution of dye (53) were mixed and the dye mixture was isolated by spray drying. The dye mixture was applied to cotton using the application and fixing methods of Example 1, resulting in a black shade providing outstanding fastness properties.<br>
Further examples were made achieving the same outstanding fastness properties and these are given in Table 1:<br><br>
