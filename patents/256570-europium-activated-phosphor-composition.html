				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>Lamps based on the Hg-discharge provide nowadays a.bout 50% of artificial light1. However, safe disposal of the burnt lamps is a serious problem as Hg is potentially hazardous causing environmental pollution. These lamps are now phased out and lamps based on LED are used in developed countries. With the advent of GaN technology LEDs emitting around 390 nm have become available. These diodes are coated with phosphor blend, which on excitation by 390 nm emit in white. During last decade solid state lighting has emerged as a new area. We have developed new, highly intense blue emitting phosphors for n-UV diodes. These phosphors will serve as indigenous replacement for blue component of phosphor blend for n-UV LED lamps. Our search for new, henceforth unreported phosphors led us to very efficient blue emitting europium doped Alkali-Alkaline Earth Halides, with a general formula where, A/*: Any alkali metal out of K, Cs or R.b M11: Any alkaline earth metal from Ca, Sr or Ba with or without Mg X: Any halide from Br or I. p and q: any integer having value 1,2 or 3. r: Activator, with concentration o.ol to 5 mole percent of M*1</td>

4. DESCRIPTION<br>
Title of the Invention<br>
Europium Activated Alkali-Alkaline Earth Halide Blue Emitting Phosphors for solid state lighting and Process of Preparation thereof<br>
Field of Invention:        Solid State Lighting<br>
This invention reports a new highly efficient Blue emitting phosphor which can form a part of the blend coated on n-UV LED. The latter is a source of white light and the relevant field is Solid State Lighting.<br>
Prior Art and its drawback<br>
Fluorescent lighting originated with the observation that low pressure Hg discharge is a very efficient converter of electrical energy into UV radiation at 254 nm. It then became obvious that the low pressure Hg discharge requires suitable visible emitting phosphor in order to become a fluorescent lamp. Thus research in phosphors development continued till last decade. Afterwards threat to environment due disposal of burnt lamps became a problem of considerable magnitude. This shifted research to a non Hg source of UV. With the advent of electroluminescent GaN diode chip, very efficient solid state source of UV became available. Efforts to make lamps by coating phosphors on these diodes have met with a limited success as yet, but tremendous progress is being made in this direction worldwide.<br>
Recently, solid-state lighting based on GaN semiconductors has made remarkable<br>
breakthroughs in efficiency. GaN-based diodes emit bright violet-blue light, which<br>
can be used to pump longer wavelength phosphors. The first white light emitting<br>
diodes (LEDs) became commercially available in 1997. These white LEDs can be<br>
obtained by combining a InGaN blue LED emitting at 465 nm with a broad-band<br>
yellow phosphor, e.g. (Y.sub.l-xGd.sub.x).sub.3(Al.sub.l-yGa.sub.y).sub.50.sub.l2<br>
(YAG:Ce). The variation of x and y can be used to produce a broad emission from<br>
510 nm and 580 nm, leading to a high color rendering index. These white LEDs have<br>
efficiencies comparable to incandescent lights and are proving useful in a wide variety<br>
of	niche	lighting	applications.<br>
White light can be produced by a variety of other approaches, including color mixing of three LED emissions (e.g., combining discrete blue, green, and red LEDs) or the pumping of phosphors with a deep blue/UV LED or laser diode (LD). Nitride-based vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSELs), coupled with phosphors optimized for violet or near-UV absorption, offer the greatest potential for high-efficiency solid-state lighting [D. A. Steigerwald, et al]. However, the problem lies in the unavailability of suitable RGB phosphors that are optimized for absorbing the near UV or violet emission from the LEDs or lasers. The red, green and blue phosphors that are currently used in conventional fluorescent lighting have been optimized for<br>
3<br><br>
excitation by the UV emission from a mercury discharge, for which the characteristic wavelengths are 185 and 254 nm [G. Blasse, et al, 1994]. The current phosphor materials of choice for the solid-state lighting initiative are Y.sub.20.sub.2S:Eu.sup.3+ for red, ZnS:(Cu.sup.+, Al.sup.3+) for green, and BaMgAl.sub.lOO.sub.l7:Eu.sup.2+ (BAM) for blue [M. Shinoya, et al]. BAM, though tested for long, is costly component of the blend due to use of rare earth Eu.sup2+. Lamp is a commodity used by masses and about 50% of lighting need is fulfilled by artificial lighting. With a huge turnover of phosphor-blends even small drop in price will have long reaching consequences in terms of lamp price. Hence it is urgently necessary to obtain a low cost substitute for blue component of the blend.<br>
Background of invention with regards to prior art:<br>
We have taken up systematic investigations on development of phosphors for solid state lighting using indigenous raw materials and novel synthesis methods. The current invention deals with synthesis of phosphors with a general formula<br><br>
p.M?X qMIIX2:rEu2+,<br><br>
where,	<br>
M1:	Any alkali metal out of K, Cs or Rb<br>
M":	Any alkaline earth metal from Ca, Sr or Ba with or without Mg<br>
X	Any halide from Br or I.<br>
p and q:	any integer having value 1,2 or 3.<br>
r:	Activator, with concentration o.ol to 5 mole percent of M11<br>
Object of the Invention<br>
It is obvious that lamp phosphors for solid state lighting must have remarkably different excitation characteristics as compared to conventional Hg discharge lamps. These phosphors must be very efficient absorber for n-UV from LED and strong emitters in red, green and blue.<br>
This patent deals with the invention of blue emitting, low cost phosphors which can be excited by near UV light, suitable for solid state lighting.<br>
We have prepared totally new, henceforth unreported, highly efficient, low cost blue emitting phosphors for SSL application. This phosphor would serve as blue component of the blend of phosphors to be applied on n-UV LED so as to convert near UV (typically 350-390 nm) emission to visible light.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
New, highly intense blue emitting phosphors for n-UV diodes are developed. These phosphors will serve as indigenous replacement for blue component of phosphor blend for n-UV LED lamps. The phosphors<br>

were prepared by wet chemical synthesis as described below.<br>
Metal carbonates of MI and Mil were dissolved in corresponding acid. The solution was then evaporated and dried at 60° C or 200°C. The resulting white dry powders were heated to carbo-thermal reduction at 600 C for bromides and 675°C for iodides.<br><br>
