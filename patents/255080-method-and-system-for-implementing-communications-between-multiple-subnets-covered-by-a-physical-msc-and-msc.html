				<td>Method and system for implementing Communications between Multiple Subnets Covered by a Physical MSC and MSC<br>
Field of the Technology<br>
The present invention relates to mobile communication technologies, more particularly to a method and a system for implementing communications between multiple subnets covered by a physical Mobile Switching Center (MSC) and an MSC.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
In networking of mobile communication systems, a local area network is partitioned and set generally according to geographical locations and the number of terminals. In areas of sparse population, it is suitable to have a large local area network that covers several small subnets in order to achieve a closer access and a wide coverage. The large local area network refers to a network covered by one physical MSC, and it is partitioned into subnets based on geographical locations to obtain small local area networks.<br>
The large local area network includes a Base Station (BS), a Base Station Controller (BSC), an MSC, a Visited Location Register (VLR) and a Home Location Register (HLR). The BS (BTS/Node B) receives and transmits wireless signals, and serves a certain area, and communicates with terminals in the area. The BTS/Node B is connected with a Base Station Controller/Radio Network Controller (BSC/RNC), which manages radio resources and controls the base station. The BSC is connected to the MSC through a Media Gateway (MGW) or directly. The MSC is mainly used for controlling the mobile calling procedure. The VLR is a database to store temporary information of terminals; and the information is needed when the MSC visits the terminal. The HLR is a database to permanently store management information of the terminals and service records of the terminals.<br>
Figure 1 shows a network structure which includes three subnets and is covered by one physical MSC. In Figure 1, the MSC/VLR covers location area 1, location area 2 and<br><br>
location area 3; the location area 1 further includes two location zones: LAI 11 and LAI 12, the location area 2 includes one location zone: LAI 2, and the location area 3 includes one location zone LAI 3. It can be seen that the whole network includes one physical and logical MSC/VLR and one HLR that controls all the terminals in the network and generates billings and traffic statistic. The existing method of distance measurement between a calling party and a called party is implemented with the MSC/VLR number. Since there is one logical MSC/VLR, the whole large local area network uses the same MSC number. The billing and traffic statistics of terminals communicating in different small local area networks, are the same as those of terminals communicating in a small local area network.<br>
The problem caused by that is it is difficult to determine which subnet the terminal currently belongs to according to the MSC/VLR number, so it is difficult to accurately bill the terminals based on the distance within the physical MSC. For example, in Figure 1 the call made by the terminal in the location area 2 to the terminal in the location area 3 is a long-distance call, but there is one MSC number so it is impossible to detect that the communication happens between different location areas, which leads to incorrect billing and the traffic statistics, and it can not be detected that the long-distance call is made by the location area 2 to the location area 3.<br>
Furthermore, since the same MSC number and the same VLR number are used in one physical MSC, it is difficult to implement some services, e.g. roaming limitation, etc., by setting the MSC number or VLR number For example, since there is one MSC/VLR number, it is impossible to make sure the terminal in the location area 2 communicates within the location area 2 without roaming to other location areas by a VLR list.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
To make the scheme, and the advantages of the present invention clearer, the present invention will be described in detail with reference to accompanying drawings.<br>
A method for implementing communication between multiple subnets covered by one physical MSC is provided, mainly including the following steps: mapping one physical MSC to multiple logical MSCs, i.e. multiple virtual MSCs, and assigning a virtual MSC number to each virtual MSC, and respectively setting a corresponding relationship belween a location area covered by a virtual MSC and the virtual MSC number of the virtual MSC; transmitting location information of a terminal with the virtual MSC number during communications to implement communications among<br><br>
multiple subnets. Furthermore, mapping one physical VLR into multiple logical and virtual VLRs, and assigning a virtual VLR number to each logical and virtual VLR; and setting relationships between the virtual MSC number and virtual VLR numbers in a system, so that each virtual MSC corresponds to one virtual VLR.<br>
In real applications, one location area can correspond to one virtual MSC, but one virtual MSC can correspond to multiple location areas, the specific relationships can be determined according to different situations. While the relationship between the virtual MSC and the virtual VLR is: one virtual MSC corresponds to at least one virtual VLR, and one VLR can correspond to multiple MSCs.<br>
The first embodiment of the present invention is applied in a communication system which has the VLR number, e.g. a Global System of Mobile (GSM), Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA). As shown in Figure 2, in the present embodiment, one physical MSC is mapped to three virtual MSCs, i.e. MSC 1, MSC 2, MSC 3, and one VLR is mapped to three virtual VLRs, the numbers of them are: VLR 1, VLR 2, and VLR 3, respectively. The relationships among the virtual MSC number, the virtual VLR number and the location areas are set as follows: the MSC 1 corresponds to the VLR 1, the MSC 2 corresponds to the VLR 2, the MSC3 corresponds to the VLR 3, the MSC 1/VLR 1 corresponds to the location areas LAI 11 and LAI 12, the MSC 2/VLR 2 corresponds to the location area LAI 2, and the MSC 3/VLR 3 corresponds to the location area LAI 3.<br>
After the step of mapping the multiple virtual MSCs and the multiple virtual VLRs, the involved communication process includes: location update, assigning the roaming number, assigning the handover number, etc. The communication process will be illustrated hereinafter in detail.<br>
The location update of the terminal will be illustrated by taking the terminal roaming from the MSC 1/VLR 1/LAI 11 to the MSC 2/VLR 2/LAI 2 as an example. As shown in Figure 3, after the terminal roams to the MSC 2/VLR 2/LAI 2, the procedure of the location update is as follows:<br>
Step 301, the terminal sends a location update request, including the information of the original location area and the current location area, to the currently visited MSC<br><br>
Step 302, the currently visited MSC 2/VLR 2 sends the location update request to the HLR of the terminal, and initiates the visiting conflict timer for the terminal.<br>
In this step, the MSC 2/VLR 2 determines that the original location area is the LAI 11, the current location area is the LAI 2, thus determines that the LAI 11 and the LAI 2 correspond to the MSC 1/VLR 1 and the MSC 2/VLR 2 respectively according to the relationships among the location, the virtual MSC and the virtual VLR. The MSC 2/VLR 2 sends the location update request, with the MSC 2 number and the VLR 2 number in it, to inform the HLR of the change of the MSC/VLR where the terminal locates.<br>
Step 303, the HLR sends a delete location request to the MSC 1/VLR 1 after receiving the location update request from the MSC 2/VLR 2, requesting the MSC 1/VLR 1 to delete the user data corresponding to the terminal.<br>
Step 304, the MSC 1/VLR 1 determines whether a visiting conflict timer is overtime after receiving the delete location request, if the timer is overtime, execute step 305; otherwise, execute step 306. Since the MSC 1/VLR 1 and the MSC 2/VLR 2 belong to the same physical MSC/VLR, the timer initiated in Step 302 is the timer in the physical MSC/VLR and the visiting conflict timer in this step.<br>
Step 305, the MSC 1/VLR 1 deletes the user data corresponding to the terminal and sends a delete location response to the HLR, and then executes Step 307.<br>
Step 306, the MSC 1/VLR 1 sends a delete location response to the HLR, and then executing Step 307, wherein, the MSC 1/VLR 1 keeps the user data of the terminal instead of deleting them.<br>
Step 307, the HLR sends an insert user data request to the MSC2/VLR2 after receiving the delete location response.<br>
Step 308, the MSC 2/VLR 2 inserts the user data corresponding to the terminal after receiving the insert user data request, and sends an insert user data response to the HLR, wherein, if the user data is not deleted in step 306, but the MSC 2/VLR 2 receives the insert user data request, then overwrite the original user data, which is not deleted by the<br><br>
Step 309, the HLR sends the location update response to the MSC 2/VLR 2.<br>
Step 310, the MSC 2/VLR 2 sends the location update response to the terminal.<br>
In this procedure, if a Super-Charge technique is adopted in the network, the location update request sent by the MSC 2/VLR 2 to the HLR in step 302 includes an information element: Supper-Charge Supported in Serving Network Entity. The HLR will not initiate the delete location procedure after receiving the request, i.e. not execute step 303 to step 308, while directly execute step 309, i.e. directly send the location update response to the MSC 2/VLR 2.<br>
The above-mentioned procedure is the location update procedure after the terminal roams to the destination location area. The procedure of assigning the roaming number after the terminal roams to the destination location area will be illustrated hereinafter.<br>
When a terminal is called, the call is firstly relayed to the Gateway Mobile Switching Center (GMSC) of the terminal, then the GMSC sends a routing request to the HLR of the terminal according to the called party number; the HLR needs to assign the roaming number after receiving the routing request. The procedure of assigning the roaming number will be illustrated hereinafter by taking the roaming from the MSC 1/VLR 1 to th^ MSC 2/VLR 2 as an example. As shown in Figure 4, the procedure includes following steps:<br>
Step 401, the HLR sends a provide roaming number request to the MSC 2/VLR 2.<br>
The provide roaming number request message includes the latest MSC number, i.e. the MSC 2 number, stored in the HLR by the called terminal, so the physical VLR can take the MSC 2 number as a prefix to assign the roaming number.<br>
Step 402, After the MSC 2/VLR 2 receives the provide roaming number request, the physical VLR assigns a roaming number to the terminal based on the MSC 2 number.<br>
Step 403, the MSC 2/VLR 2 sends a provide roaming number response to the HLR.<br>
Step 404, the HLR sends an initial address message to the MSC 2/VLR 2.<br><br>
Step 405, the MSC 2/VLR 2 initiates paging to the called terminal.<br>
The roaming number of the called terminal embodies the logical MSC where the called terminal locates after assigning the roaming number, so the billing center can detect the location of the called terminal without any modification.<br>
In addition, to implement the handover billing, the embodiment of the present invention assigns the handover number for the terminal during the handover between the physical MSC and the virtual MSC or between the virtual MSCs. For example, during a call, a terminal handover from a neighbor MSC to the virtual MSC 3, add the destination MSC number, i.e. MSC 3 number, to the prepare handover message, so the VLR can assign the handover number to the terminal based on the MSC 3 number. The specific steps are as shown in Figure 5:<br>
Step 501, the neighbor MSC sends a prepare handover request, including information of the destination virtual MSC, i.e. MSC 3, and information of the destination cell, to the physical MSC/VLR where the MSC 3/VLR 3 locates.<br>
Step 502, the physical MSC/VLR sends a handover request to the Base Station Controller (BSC) that corresponds to the handover destination cell after receiving the prepare handover request.<br>
Step 503, the BSC sends a handover response to the physical MSC/VLR.<br>
Step 504, the MSC/VLR determines the corresponding location area according to the information of the handover destination cell, and then indexes to the virtual MSC number, i.e. the MSC 3 number, according to the location area, and takes the virtual MSC number as the prefix of the assigned handover number.<br>
Step 505, the MSC 3/VLR 3 sends a prepare handover response to the neighbor MSC.<br>
Step 506, the neighbor MSC sends an initial address message to the MSC 3/VLR 3.<br>
The above-mentioned is the procedure of assigning the handover number.<br>
In the intelligent service, when the terminal initiates the call at a roaming location,<br><br>
and the terminal is the calling party, the SSP reports the currently visited virtual MSC number to the SCR The SCP can obtain exactly the roaming situation of the calling terminal according to the virtual MSC number reported by the SSP and the home MSC number of the calling terminal, and can bill according to the situation.<br>
When the terminal is a called party and the called party is a trigger, then the problem of whether the terminal is roaming is involved. Since the terminal is determined to be roaming according to the MSC number and the VLR number, after the MSC/VLR sends the routing request to the HLR, the HLR returns the virtual MSC number and the virtual VLR number of the terminal during the location update, thus the SCP can obtain the roaming situation of the called party, and bills based on the situation. As shown in Figure 6, the specific steps are as follows:<br>
Step 601, the home virtual MSC of the called terminal sends an obtaining routing information request, including the called party number, i.e. the called terminal number, to the HLR.<br>
Step 602, the HLR obtains the visited virtual MSC number and virtual VLR number of the terminal according to the called party number, and returns a routing information response, including the visited virtual MSC number and virtual VLR number of the terminal, to the home virtual MSC of the terminal.<br>
Step 603, the home virtual MSC of the called terminal reports the visited virtual MSC number and virtual VLR number of the called terminal to the SCP.<br>
Therefore, the SCP can bill the called terminal based on the virtual MSC number reported by the home virtual MSC.<br>
As to the call statistic, since multiple virtual MSC/VLR numbers are adopted in a large network, the call statistic can be done according to the virtual MSC/VLR numbers, and can be differentiated by the MSC/VLR numbers, and the call statistic, roaming statistic and the handover statistic can be implemented respectively.<br>
In this embodiment, the limitation method to the roaming terminal is also included. The limitation can be implemented with the VLR list of the terminal. For example, a local service is provided in the urban area of the city (MSC 1/VLR 1), it is necessary to make<br><br>
sure the terminal apply the local service in the rural area (MSC 2/VLR 2 or MSC 3/VLR 3). This can be done through the following steps: when the terminal initiates the location update request after roaming to the rural area, the HLR will know the virtual VLR number of the rural area, as seen in the location update procedure, the HLR compares the virtual VLR number with the VLR list of the terminal, determining that the virtual VLR number is not in the contracted services, therefore the service of the terminal in this area is limited.<br>
The second embodiment of the present invention is in the communication system without the VLR number. Since the VLR number is only involved in the procedure of location update and the roaming limitation, the majority of this embodiment is the same as those in the first embodiment, only the procedures of location update and the roaming limitation are different, which will be described hereinafter.<br>
In the procedure of the location update, the difference between this embodiment and the first embodiment is that: in Step 302 of the first embodiment, the location update request sent by the MSC2/VLR2 to the HLR includes the virtual MSC2 number.<br>
In the procedure of the roaming limitation, operators can limit the service of the terminal through the MSC List. For example, a local service is provided in the urban area of the city (MSC 1/VLR 1), it is necessary to make sure the terminal apply the local service in the rural area (MSC 2/VLR 2 or MSC 3/VLR 3). This can be done through the following steps: when the terminal initiates the location update request after roaming to the rural area, the HLR will obtain the virtual VLR number of the rural area, as seen in the location update procedure, the HLR compares the virtual VLR number with the VLR list of the terminal, determining that the virtual VLR number is not in the contracted services, therefore the service of the terminal in this area is limited.<br>
In practical applications, the method of the present invention can be appropriately improved to satisfy the needs of specific scenarios. Therefore, it is understood that the above-mentioned are only the preferred embodiments of the invention and are not used to confine the protection scope of the invention.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
