a-Substitution OF UNPROTECTED P-AMINO ESTER COMPOUNDS<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention is directed to a method for stereoselective a-substitution of unprotected P-amino ester compounds under mild conditions. The resultant a-substituted unprotected ‘amino ester compounds are useful in preparing a plethora of biologically active compounds, for example, Factor Xa inhibitors that are useful for treating physiological conditions in a patient that can be ameliorated by administering the inhibitor of Factor Xa.<br>
Recent Developments<br>
Current methods for a-substitution of P-amino ester or acid compounds require the amine to be protected/functionalized before the substitution. In addition, current methods also necessitate the eventual removal of the amine protecting/fictionalization group.<br>
Jurists et al., J. Org. Chem., 58, 2282-5 (1993) disclose the a-substitution of (J-amino acid compounds as follows in Scheme I: (1) converting the (3-amino acid compounds<br><br>
to corresponding perhydropyrimidine-4-one compounds; (2) alkylating the perhydropyrimidine-4-one compounds; and (3) ring opening the resultant alkylated perhydropyrimidine-4-one corn-pounds to yield the corresponding a-alkylated (3-amino acid compounds. See Jurasti, Enantio-selective Synthesis of P-amino Acids (Wiley-VCH, New York, 1997) 263-70. Juristic et al. do not disclose the a-substitution of unprotected or unfunctionalized P-amino acid compounds.<br>
Seebach et al., Tetrahedron Lett., 28(7), 3103-6 (1987) disclose the a-substitution of p-amino ester compounds as follows in Scheme II: (1) protecting the amine group of the P-amino ester compounds; (2) alkylating the N-protected p-amino ester compounds; and (3) deprotecting the a-alkylated N-protected P-amino acid corn-pounds. See also Estermann et al., Helv. Chim, Acta, 71, 1824-39 (1988). Neither Seebach or Ester Mann disclose a-substitution of unprotected or unfunctionalized P-amino acid compounds.<br><br><br>
Scheme II In view of the aforesaid, it would be worthwhile to have synthetic procedures for preparing a-substituted p-amino ester compounds that require fewer reactants and/or steps, i.e., simplified and less costly synthetic procedures.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to a method for stereoselective substitution in which a (mono or un)-a-substituted unprotected p-amino ester compound or salt thereof is reacted with an aliphatic electrophile in the presence of a base selected from alkyl lithium compounds, lithium hydride, lithium amide, lithium dialkyl amides and alkali hexamethyldisilylamines.<br>

Compounds of the present invention are useful in the form of the free base or acid or in the form of salts thereof. All forms are within the scope of the invention. Where the compound of the present invention is substituted with a basic moiety, acid addition saks can be formed and can be a simply more convenient form for use; and in practice, use of the salt form inherently amounts to use of the free base form. The acids which can be used to prepare the acid addition salts include preferably those which produce, when combined with the free base, salts whose activity/reactivity relative to their free bases is not vitiated by side effects ascribable to the anions. Although pharmaceutically acceptable salts of said basic compounds are preferred, all acid addition salts are useful as sources of the free base form even if the particular salt, per se, is desired only as an intermediate product as, for example, when the salt is formed only for pur-poses of purification, and identification, or when it is used as inter-mediate in preparing a phar-maceutically acceptable salt by ion exchange procedures. Salts within the scope of the inven-tion are those derived from the following acids: mineral acids such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid and sulfamic acid; and organic acids such as acetic acid, citric acid, lactic acid, tartaric acid, malonic acid, methanesufonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, benzene-sulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, cyclohexylsulfamic acid, quinic acid, benzoic acid and the like.

A preferred acid addition saltis;theben2oate<br>
According to the invention, acid addition salts of the inventive compounds are prepared by reaction of the free base with the appropriate acid, by known methods. For example, the acid addition salts of the inventive compounds are prepared either by dissolving the free base in aqueous or aqueous-alcohol solution or other suitable solvents containing the appropriate acid and isolating the sah by evaporating the solution, or by reacting the free base and acid in an organic solvent, in which case the salt separates directly or by concentration of the solution.<br>
The free base form of compounds according to this invention can be regenerated from the acid addition salts by the application or adaptation of known methods. For example, parent compounds of the invention can be regenerated from their acid addition salts by treatment with an alkali, e.g. aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution or aqueous ammonia solution.<br>

2.	The method according to claim 1 wherein said base is an alkali hexamethyldisilylamines selected from the group consisting of Limes, Names and KHMDS.<br>
3.	The method according to claim 2, wherein said alkali hexamethyldisilylamines is Limes.<br>
4.	The method according to claim 1 wherein the aliphatic electrophile is a primary allelic or benzylic compound.<br>
5.	The method according to claim 4, wherein said aliphatic electrophile is selected from the group consisting of propenylbromide, w-cyanobenzylbromide, benzaldehyde, benzyl chloride and phenylchloroformate.<br>
6.	The method according to claim 1 wherein the unprotected P-amino ester compound is of the formula I<br><br>
wherein R’ and R’ are independently hydrogen, aliphatic or aromatic; R’, R'* and R’ are independently aliphatic or aromatic; and R’ and R’** are independently hydrogen, aliphatic or aromatic, provided that one of R’ and R* is hydrogen, or a salt thereof.<br>
7.	The method according to claim 6 wherein the unprotected J3-amino ester compound is of the<br>
formula II<br><br>
wherein at least one of R\ R’ and R’ is hydrogen; R’ and R'* are independently aliphatic or aromatic; and R’’ and R’** are hydrogen, or a salt thereof.<br>
8.	The method according to claim 7 wherein R* and R" are both hydrogen.<br><br>
9.	The method accordmg to claim /  <br>
10.	-   The method according to claim 9.wherein Bromomethyl  ethyl or bendy<br>
11.	The method according to claim 7 wherein R  is alkyl.<br>
12.	The method according to claim 11 wherein R' is methyl.<br>
13.	The method according to claim 7 wherein R’ is hydrogen.<br>
14.	The method according to claim 1 wherein the reacting step is carried out in an aprotic solvent.<br>
15.	The method according to claim 14 wherein the aprotic solvent is polar,<br>
16.	The method according to claim 15 wherein the polar aprotic solvent is selected from the group consisting of lower alkyl ethers, cyclic ethers and glumes<br>
17.	The method according to claim 16 wherein the polar aprotic solvent is tetrahydrofuran or dimsthoxyethane.<br>
18.	The method according to claim 1 wherein the reacting step is carried out in a mixture of a polar and a nonpolar aprotic solvent.<br>
19.	The method according to claim 18 wherein the nonpolar aprotic solvent is toluene.<br>
20.	The method according to claim 1 wherein the reacting step is carried out at a temperature between about -78°C to about 10°C.<br>
21.	The method according to claim 1 wherein the reacting step is carried out in the presence of a Li, Na or K inorganic salt,<br>
22.	The method according to claim 21 wherein the inorganic salt is a lithium halide.<br>
23.	The method according to claim 22 wherein the lithium halide is lithium bromide.<br><br>
