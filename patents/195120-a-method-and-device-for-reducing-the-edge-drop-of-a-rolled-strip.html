Description<br><br>
The invention relates to a method and device<br>
for reducing the edge drop of a rolled strip in a roll train.<br>
During the rolling of metal strips because of the mechanical properties of roll stands and the flow properties of the rolled metal, so-called edge drop occurs, that is to say a flattening of the rolled strip at the edges. It is known to counteract the edge drop by means of so-called tapered rolls. To this end/ the operating rolls are curved in a suitable way. In order to drive the so-called tapered rolls, the edge drop is measured upstream and downstream of the appropriate roll stand. However, these measurements are expensive, in particular when they have to be carried out for a plurality of roll stands. A further problem in the known method for reducing the edge drop is that the measures for reducing the edge drop must not lead to an impermissibly high tension in the edge region of the rolled strip nor to wavy edges. If the permissible tension in the edge region of the rolled strip is exceeded, then this can lead to an impermissible reduction in the quality of the rolled strip. In order to avoid this, in the case of the known method for reducing the edge drop, it is necessary to measure the strip tension in the edge region of the rolled strip.<br>
It is the object of the invention to specify a method and equipment for circumventing the abovementioned<br>
disadvantages.<br>
This object is achieved by means of a method and equipment according to the figures of the invention measuring equipment for measuring-the edge drop is saved. Furthermore, using the roll gap model it is possible to calculate the tension relationships in the roll strip, so<br><br>
 - 2 -<br>
that: a complicated measurement of the tension relationships for monitoring can be dispensed with. In addition, the method according to the invention can advantageously be combined with flatness regulation or flatness control. The roll gap model moreover permits the edge drop to be calculated in advance, so that if appropriate necessary presettings can be made.<br>
Advantageous and inventive details emerge from<br>
the following description of exemplary embodiments, with<br><br>
reference to the accompanying drawings and in conjunction with the<br>
subclaims. In detail:<br>
FIG 1 shows the cross-section of a rolled strip,<br>
FIG 2 shows the inventive method for reducing the edge<br>
drop of a rolled strip, FIG 3 shows the inventive method for reducing the edge<br>
drop of a rolled strip in an alternative configuration, FIG 4 shows a model according to the inventive method<br>
for reducing the edge drop of a rolled strip, FIG 5 shows part of a device for reducing the edge drop<br>
of a rolled strip.<br>
FIG 1 shows the cross-section of a rolled strip with edge drop. In this case, b designates the width of the rolled strip, bx the region of the rolled strip which is free of edge drop and bG,L and bG,R the edge region of the rolled strip having edge drop.<br>
Furthermore, d5 designates the thickness of the rolled strip at a distance of 5 mm from the edge of the rolled strip, and d100 the thickness of the rolled strip at a distance of 100 mm from the edge of the rolled strip. These two values are included in one possible definition for the edge drop F, if this is expressed by a numerical value. This possible definition is:<br><br>
However, the edge drop can also be represented as a contour, that is to say as a function over the strip width. This representation advantageously forms the basis<br><br>
 - 3 -<br>
of the inventive method for reducing the edge drop of a rolled strip.<br>
FIG 2 shows an exemplary application of the inventive method for reducing the edge drop of a rolled strip 11. The rolled strip 11 is rolled by means of five roll stands, a first roll stand indicated by the rolls 1 and 2, a second roll stand indicated by the rolls 3 and 4, a third roll stand indicated by the rolls 5 and 6, a fourth roll stand indicated by the rolls 7 and 8 and a fifth roll stand indicated by the rolls 9 and 10. The five roll stands are part of a five-stand or multi-stand roll train. The first, second and third roll stand have actuators 12, 13, 14, with which the edge drop of the rolled strip 11 can be influenced. Input variables for the actuators 12, 13 and 14 are the values for the edge drop P1, P2 and P3. Since the system has only two items of measuring equipment 21 and 22 for measuring the edge drop upstream of the first and downstream of the fifth roll stand, the edge drops downstream of the first roll stand P1, downstream of the second roll stand P2 and downstream of the third roll stand P3 are determined by means of a roll gap model. This model has five partial models 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, which are each assigned to one roll stand. Partial model 15 is assigned to the first roll stand, partial model 16 to the second roll stand, partial model 17 to the third roll stand, partial model 18 to the fourth roll stand and partial model 19 to the fifth roll stand. Output variables of the partial model 15 are the edge drop P1 and the tension relationships s1 in or downstream of the first roll stand, which are in turn input variables of the partial model 16. Output variables of the partial model 16 are the edge drop P3 and the tension relationships G2 in or downstream of the second roll stand, which are in turn input variables of the partial model 17. Output variables of the partial model 17 are the edge drop P3 and the tension relationships s3 in or downstream of the third roll stand, which are in turn input variables of the partial model 18. Output variables of the partial model 18 are the edge drop P4<br><br><br>
	- 4 -<br>
and the tension relationships s4 in or downstream of the fourth roll stand, which are in turn input variables of the partial model 19. Output variables of the partial model 19 are the edge drop F5 and the tension relationships C5 in or downstream of the fifth roll stand. The tension relationships s1, s2, s3, sA and s5 are to be understood as the web tension (flatness) and/or the tension of the rolled strip directly before entering the roll gap or directly after exiting from the roll gap.<br>
Input variables of the first partial model 15 are the edge-drop Po upstream of the first roll stand and, if<br><br>
appropriate, the tension relationships so upstream of the first roll stand. The tension relationships so upstream of the first roll stand are then included in the partial model 15 when the rolled strip is, for example, uncoiled from a coil. Further input variables of the partial models 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 are the roll contours for the individual roll stands. These input variables are not shown in FIG 1. The roll contour is advantageously calculated in a roll contour model which, inter alia, comprises a temperature model, a wear model and a bending model. In this case there is advantageously an individual roll contour model for each roll stand.<br>
During the rolling of the rolled strip 11, the partial models 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 are continuously adapted to the actual relationships in the roll stands by means of an adaptation 20, which determines appropriate parameters (1 (2, (3, (4 and (5 for the corresponding partial models 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 from the edge drop upstream of the first roll stand P0,1st from the edge drop P5 determined by the partial model 19 downstream of the fifth roll stand, and from the actual value of the edge drop P5,1st downstream of the fifth roll stand.<br>
FIG 3 shows an exemplary application of the inventive method for reducing the edge drop of a rolled strip 11. The rolled strip 11 is rolled by means of five roll stands, a first roll stand indicated by the rolls 1 and 2, a second roll stand indicated by the rolls 3 and 4, a third roll stand indicated by the rolls 5 and 6, a<br><br><br>
 - 5 -<br>
fourth roll stand indicated by the rolls 7 and 8 and a fifth roll stand indicated by the rolls 9 and 10. The five roll stands are part of a five-stand or multi-stand roll train. The first, second and third roll stands have actuators 30, 31, 32 with which the edge drop of the rolled strip 11 can be influenced. Input variables of the actuators 30, 31 and 32 are the values for the edge drop P1 ,P2 and P3,1st. Since the system has only two items of measuring euipment 40 and 41 for measuring the edge drop upstream of the first and downstream of the third roll stand, the edge drops downstream of the first roll stand P1, downstream of the second roll stand F2 and downstream of the third roll stand P3 are determined by means of a roll gap model. This model has three partial models 33, 34 and 35, each of which is assigned to one roll stand. Partial model 33 is assigned to the first roll stand, partial model 34 to the second roll stand and partial model 35 to the third roll stand. Output variables of the partial model 33 are the edge drop P1 and the tension relationships s1 in or downstream of the first roll stand, which are in turn input variables of the partial model 34. Output variables of the partial model 34 are the edge drop P2 and the tension relationships s2 in or downstream of the second roll stand, which are in turn input variables of the partial model 35. Output variables of the partial model 35 are the edge drop P3 and, if appropriate, the tension relationships s3 in or downstream of the third roll stand.<br>
Input variables of the first partial model 33 are the edge drop PO,1st upstream of the first roll stand and, if appropriate, the tension relationships so upstream of the first roll stand. The tension relationships s0 upstream of the first roll stand are then included in the partial model 35 when the rolled strip is, for example, uncoiled from a coil. Further input variables of the partial models 33, 34 and 35 are the roll contours for the individual roll stands. These input variables are not shown in FIG 3. The roll contour is advantageously calculated in a roll contour model which, inter alia.<br><br>
	- 6 -<br>
comprises a temperature model, a wear model and a bending model. In this case there is advantageously an individual roll contour model for each roll stand.<br>
During the rolling of the rolled strip 11, the partial models 33, 34 and 35 are continuously adapted to the actual relationships in the roll stands by means of an adaptation 36, which determines appropriate parameters (1, ( 2 and (3 for the corresponding partial models 33, 34 and 35 from the edge drop upstream of the first roll stand P0,1st from the edge drop P3 determined by the partial model 3 5 downstream of the third roll stand and the actual value of the edge drop P3,1st downstream of the third roll stand.<br>
FIG 4 illustrates the interaction of roll contour model 60, roll gap model 61 and an actuator 62. On the basis of process state information X1 and the output U1 of the actuator 62, the roll contour model 60 calculates the roll contour Wi, which is in turn an input variable into the roll gap model 61. Further input variables into the roll gap model are the edge drop Pi-1 and the tension relationships si-1 upstream of the roll stand. Output variables of the roll gap model 61 are the edge drop Pi and tension relationships si downstream of the roll stand. On the basis of the edge drop Pi downstream of the roll stand, the actuator 62 determines the manipulated variable Ui.<br>
FIG 5 shows a possible roll configuration for<br>
implementing the manipulated variable Ui from FIG 4. The steel strip 56 is rolled between two operating rolls 57 and 58. Supporting and intermediate rolls are not shown in FIG 5. In order to reduce the roll diameter at the end region of the rolled strip, which counteracts the edge drop, the system has two items of cooling equipment 54 and 55, from which coolant 50, 51, 52, 53, advantageously water, emerges and is applied to the operating rolls 54 and 58. The necessary coolant quantity corresponds, for example, to the variable U1 of FIGS 1 to 4.<br><br>
