				<td>PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITION OF ARGININE AND IBUPROFEN<br>
[001] The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition for oral<br>
or injectable (parenteral) use containing 2-(4-isobutylphenyl) propionic acid and a<br>
basic amino acid, and more particularly, where the arnino acid is arginine.<br>
Background of Invention<br>
[002] 2-(4-isobutylphenyl) propionic acid, whose International<br>
Nonproprietary Name is ibuprofen, is a well-known anti-inflammatory drug having a<br>
molecular weight of 206.28 and the following chemical structure:<br><br>
(Merck Index 12th ed., n4925, page 839). Originally patented in the 1960"s,<br>
ibuprofen is now marketed generically, as well as under the tradenames of Motrin®,<br>
Advil®, and Nuprin® for the treatment of pain, inflammation, and fever.<br>
[003] Ibuprofen is readily available as the racemic mixture ((RS)-Ibuprofen)<br>
of the two enantiomers, (R)-Ibuprofen and (S)-Ibuprofen. Even though the (S)<br>
enantiomer is the biologically active form, most preparations contain the racemic<br>
mixture since the (R) enantiomer is converted to the active (S) form in-vivo. For<br>
simplicity, hereinafter the term "ibuprofen" will be used to indicate any one of the (R)<br>
enantiomer, the (S) enantiomer, or the racemate.<br>
[004] Many amino acids, including arginine, are available as both the D and<br>
L forms. For simplicity, hereinafter the term "arginine" will indicate the D or L form<br>
of arginine or a mixture of (D)-arginine and (L)-arginine. Arginine has a molecular<br>
weight of 174.20.<br>
[005] Although ibuprofen has many advantages over other analgesics such as<br>
aspirin and acetaminophen, it is very poorly soluble in water. Thus, certain dosage<br>
forms of ibuprofen, especially oral or injectable liquids, have been difficult to<br>
develop. Several U.S. patents have addressed this problem.<br>
[006] For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,309,421 appears to describe water-<br>
soluble complexes of ibuprofen and phospholipids suitable for parenteral<br>
administration. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,859,704 and 4,861,797 appear to describe the<br>
synthesis of alkali metal salts of ibuprofen for preparing a liquid ibuprofen<br>
formulation.<br>
[007] Other U.S. patents appear to address this problem by preparing an<br>
ibuprofen salt with a basic amino acid as the active pharmaceutical ingredientand<br>
then solubilizing the salt to produce a liquid dosage form.<br>
[008] For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,200,558 appears to describe enhanced<br>
analgesic effects of S (+) ibuprofen as salts of L and D amino, acids, including<br>
arginine, in various dosage forms, including as an injectable Solution. U.S. Pat. No.<br>
4,279,926 appears to describe the use of basic amino acid salts of propionic acids for<br>
relieving pain and treating inflammatory conditions. Similarly, U.S. Pat. No.<br>
5,463,117 appears to describe the preparation of salts of ibuprofen with basic amino<br>
acids. Finally, U.S. Pat. No. 6,005,005 appears to describe a liquid composition for<br>
oral use containing ibuprofen and arginine,,<br>
[009] However, the approaches described in the patents discussed above<br>
have, among others, the disadvantage of requiring the formation of a salt before<br>
solubilization, where the salt must be isolated and tested prior to producing the dosage<br>
form. Additionally, the ibuprofen formulations resulting from those processes have at<br>
least a 1:1 molar ratio of amino acid to ibuprofen. It is beneficial from both a cost and<br>
development point to not have to form a salt and isolate and test it prior to producing<br>
the dosage form. It is also beneficial in most cases to minimize the amount of non-<br>
active components, including salts, used in therapeutic products in order to minimize<br>
potential side effects. Furthermore, for injectable products it is beneficial to produce<br>
a liquid dosage form of ibuprofen having a pH similar to that of blood (pH 7.4).<br>
Finally, it is beneficial for an injectable and aral product to have"similar<br>
pharmacokinetics to minimize the need for dosage adjustments.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
[010] The present invention utilizes arginine to solubilize ibuprofen during<br>
the manufacture of the pharmaceutical product instead of using a salt form of<br>
ibuprofen. Thus, an embodiment of the present invention is a pharmaceutical<br>
composition comprising an aqueous solution of arginine and ibuprofen, wherein the<br>
molar ratio of arginine to ibuprofen is less than 1:1. Another embodiment of the<br>
present invention is a method of making a pharmaceutical composition comprising an<br>
aqueous solution of arginine and ibuprofen, wherein the molar ratio of arginine to<br>
ibuprofen is less than 1:1. Still other embodiments of the present invention are<br>
directed to methods of treating pain, inflammation, fever, and/or other conditions<br>
alleviated by ibuprofen comprising administering a pharmaceutical composition<br>
comprising an aqueous solution of arginine and ibuprofen, wherein the molar ratio of<br>
arginine to ibuprofen is less than 1:1.<br>
Brief Description of the Accompanying Figure<br>
[011] The Figure shows plasma concentration-time curves for 400 mg oral<br>
and intravenous ibuprofen.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
[012] The present inventor has discovered that a liquid composition of<br>
ibuprofen can be produced by combining ibuprofen with arginine at molar ratios that<br>
minimize the amount of arginine necessary to solubilize the ibuprofen. Thus, one<br>
embodiment of the present invention is a pharmaceutical composition comprising an<br>
aqueous solution of arginine and ibuprofen, wherein the molar ratio of arginine to<br>
ibuprofen is less than 1:1. In another embodiment of the invention, the molar ratio of<br>
arginine to ibuprofen is from about 0.10:1 to about 0.999:1. In yet other embodiments<br>
of the invention, the molar ratio of arginine to ibuprofen is 0.92:1 or 0.60:1 or 0.99:1.<br>
[013] The present inventor has further discovered a method of making a<br>
pharmaceutical composition comprising an aqueous solution of arginine and<br>
ibuprofen in a molar ratio of less than 1:1, wherein the method comprises the<br>
following: adding arginine to water, mixing until the arginine is dissolved to form an<br>
arginine solution, adding ibuprofen to the arginine solution, and mixing until the<br>
ibuprofen is dissolved to form the aqueous solution of arginine and ibuprofen,<br>
optionally adding sufficient water to result in the desired concentration of ibuprofen,<br>
and optionally separating any precipitate using standard methods such as filtration or<br>
centrifugation. The resulting product is a clear, colorless solution that can readily be<br>
passed through a 0.2 micron filter. The pH of the resulting solution can be adjusted<br>
using techniques known in the art to achieve a desired pH, for example a pH similar<br>
to that of blood. Finally, the resulting solution can be terminally sterilized or<br>
lyophilized.<br>
[014] The present inventor has further discovered a method of treating a<br>
condition chosen from pain, inflammation, fever, and/or other conditions alleviated by<br>
ibuprofen comprising administering to a patient in need thereof an effective amount of<br>
a pharmaceutical composition comprising an aqueous solution of arginine and<br>
ibuprofen, wherein the molar ratio of arginine to ibuprofen is less than 1:1. Other<br>
conditions alleviated by ibuprofen include, but are not limited to, patent ductus<br>
arteriosis and certain forms of cancer. The pharmaceutical composition may be<br>
administered by injection (intravenous or intramuscular) or orally. Dosages of the<br>
pharmaceutical composition range from about 5 to about 1000 mg of ibuprofen in the<br>
pharmaceutical composition and can be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
In one embodiment, the dosage is from about 100 to about 800 mg of ibuprofen in the<br>
pharmaceutical composition. In a further embodiment, the dosage is about 400 mg of<br>
ibuprofen in the pharmaceutical composition. In still another embodiment, the dosage<br>
of the pharmaceutical composition is from about 5 to about 10 mg/kg, and in a further<br>
embodiment the dosage of the pharmaceutical composition is about 7.5 mg/kg.<br>
[015] The following examples represent specific embodiments of the<br>
foregoing discovery, and they are not representative of the entire scope of the<br>
invention. The ibuprofen and arginine used in the examples are United States<br>
Pharmacopoea grade, but other pharmaceutically acceptable materials can be utilized.<br>
Example 1<br>
[016] Add 8.2 kg of arginine to approximately 80 liters of water for injection<br>
and mix until dissolved. Add 10.0 kg of ibuprofen to the arginine solution and mix<br>
until dissolved. Add a sufficient quantity of water to equal 100 liters, resulting in a<br>
lOOmg/mL solution having a molar ratio of 0.97:1 (arginine:ibuprofen). The product<br>
results in a clear, colorless, solution that can readily be passed through a 0.2 micron<br>
filter. The pH of the resulting solution is approximately 7.4 and can be adjusted to<br>
achieve somewhat lower or higher pH"s as desired. The solution can further be<br>
terminally sterilized to minimize the likelihood of a non-sterile product.<br>
Example 2<br>
[017] Lower concentrations of ibuprofen can be prepared by using lesser<br>
amounts of arginine and ibuprofen. Add 41 g of arginine to approximately 80 liters of<br>
water for injection and mix until dissolved. Add 50 g of ibuprofen to the arginine<br>
solution and mix until dissolved. Add a sufficient quantity of water to equal 100 liters,<br>
resulting in a 0.5mg/mL solution having a molar ratio of 0.97:1 (arginine:ibuprofen).<br>
The product results in a clear, colorless, solution that can readily be passed through a<br>
0.2 micron filter. The pH of the resulting solution can be adjusted to achieve a<br>
desirable pH.<br>
Example 3<br>
[018] Lower concentrations of arginine can be used to prepare the ibuprofen<br>
solution. Add 3.8 kg of arginine to approximately 80 liters of water for injection and<br>
mix until dissolved. Add 7.5 kg of ibuprofen to the arginine solution and mix until<br>
dissolved. Add a sufficient quantity of water to equal 100 liters, resulting in a<br>
75mg/mL solution having a molar ratio of 0.60:1 (arginine:ibuprofen). The product<br>
can bs passed through a 0.2 micron filter resulting in &amp; clear colorless solution. The<br>
pH of the resulting solution can be adjusted to achieve a desirable pH.<br>
Example 4<br>
[019] Higher concentrations of arginine can be used to prepare the ibuprofen<br>
solution. Add 8.43 g of arginine to 80 mL of water for injection and mix until<br>
dissolved. Add 10 g of ibuprofen to the arginine solution and mix until dissolved.<br>
Add a sufficient quantity of water to equal 100 mL, resulting in a lOOmg/mL solution<br>
having a molar ratio of 0.99:1 (arginine:ibuprofen). The product results in a clear,<br>
colorless, solution that can readily be passed through a 0.2 micron filter. The pH of<br>
the resulting solution can be adjusted to achieve a desirable pH.<br>
Example S<br>
[020] 4.384 kg of arginine were added to approximately 45 liters of water for<br>
inj ection and mixed until dissolved. 5.62 kg of ibuprofen were added to the argrnine<br>
solution and mixed until dissolved. The pH of the resulting solution was<br>
approximately 7.4, but could be adjusted to achieve somewhat lower or higher pH"s<br>
as desired. A sufficient quantity of water was added to the resulting solution to equal<br>
56.2 liters, resulting in a 100 mg/mL solution having a molar ratio of 0.92:1<br>
(arginine:ibuprofen). The product resulted in a clear, colorless solution that could<br>
readily be passed through a 0.2 micron filter. The solution was terminally sterilized to<br>
assure that the product was sterilized.<br>
Example 6<br>
[021 ] In an attempt to demonstrate similar pharmacokinetics between a 60<br>
minute infusion of intravenous ibuprofen solubilized with arginine as in Example 5<br>
and oral ibuprofen (in the form of Advil® Liqui-Gels®), volunteers received single<br>
oral or intravenous doses (200 mg, 400 mg, or 800 mg) of either oral or intravenous<br>
ibuprofen product. Blood samples were collected at specified times relative to the<br>
start of dosing, and plasma ibuprofen concentrations were measured. The following<br>
pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated: Cmax(maximum concentration), AUCo.<br>
12 (area under the curve from initial time to 12 hours), AUC(j.«,, (area under the curve<br>
from initial time to infinity), Tmax (time of maximum concentration), kel (elimination<br>
constant), and t1/2(half life). Statistical analyses were performed on the plasma<br>
concentration data and pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated for the 12 patients<br>
on each of the three doses examined.<br>
[022] The plasma concentration-time profiles for both oral and intravenous<br>
administration of ibuprofen were observed to be very similar. The concentration-time<br>
data for the 400-mg oral and intravenous doses are shown in the Figure to illustrate<br>
this result. On the basis of the ibuprofen concentration-time data, the following<br>
pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated (Table 1).<br>
Table 1. Pharmacokinetic Parameters After Oral and Intravenous<br>
Administration of Ibuprofen<br>
Data shown are mean ± standard deviation.<br>
[023] The linearity of ibuprofen pharmacokinetics after oral and intravenous<br>
administration was analyzed. The results indicated that for both intravenous<br>
ibuprofen and oral ibuprofen, AUCo-12, AUCo-oo, and Cmax increased in an<br>
appropriately linear manner with dose.<br>
