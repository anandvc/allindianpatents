FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an arrangement for, in a<br>
communications network, allocating addresses to clients or<br>
users connecting to the network. The arrangement comprises at<br>
least one address holding means holding a pool, or a<br>
plurality, of addresses, and allocating control means for,<br>
from said pool, allocating addresses to users or clients, and<br>
detecting when an address is released or when a client or a<br>
user allocated an address disconnects or is disconnected. The<br>
invention also relates to a node in a mobile communications<br>
system which comprises an arrangement for allocating addresses<br>
to users or clients connecting to the network. The node<br>
comprises holding means for holding a plurality of addresses<br>
for allocation to users or clients.<br>
Still further the invention relates to a method for, in a<br>
communications network, providing allocation of addresses to<br>
users or clients.<br>
STATE OF THE ART<br>
In networks implementing dynamic addressing, allocation of<br>
addresses has to be used to provide users or clients<br>
connecting to the network with temporary addresses. Such<br>
addresses are allocated from a server in the network or from a<br>
peer. Several protocols have been standardized for handling<br>
such address allocation. One standardized protocol is the<br>
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), cf. RFC (Request<br>
For Comments) 2131 3315. Another such protocol is Remote<br>
Authentication Dial in User Service (RADIUS), standardized in<br>
RFC 2865.<br><br><br>
However, in mobile communications system such as GPRS (GSM<br>
Packet Radio Service), CDMA 2000 (Code Division Multiple<br>
Access) etc. connections to the network occur frequently and<br>
the connections are typically only maintained for short<br>
periods. IPv4 or IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 4 and 6<br>
respectively) addresses are used which uniquely identify the<br>
user and the addresses may be kept in multiple nodes, such as<br>
nodes in authentication systems, in billing systems, and<br>
application gateways and application servers, throughout the<br>
network. Among others due to the fact that the addresses are<br>
kept at a plurality of locations a quick assignment and<br>
release of addresses get problematic when the same addresses<br>
are reused.<br>
Currently addresses are mostly assigned in a circular fashion<br>
and a released address will only be reused when all other<br>
addresses have been assigned to users. However, with such a<br>
solution it can not be guaranteed that an address will not be<br>
reused immediately following upon release thereof. The number<br>
of addresses that are required is high, and to prevent<br>
addresses from being reused too quickly, still larger pools of<br>
addresses are required. It is also a problem that the<br>
allocation systems used today for allocation of the IPv4 or<br>
IPv6 addresses, cannot guarantee a delay before reuse of an<br>
address, which means that in fact addresses will be reused<br>
frequently or reused more or less immediately upon release,<br>
which makes it easier to predict end user IP addresses. Thus<br>
there is a problem, in such systems, that end user IP<br>
addresses e.g. addresses of mobiles, laptops etc. easily can<br>
be predicted and used for illegal purposes, which is serious.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br><br><br>
It is therefore an object of the invention to provide an<br>
arrangement as initially referred to, through which prediction<br>
of allocated addresses is made more difficult. It is still<br>
further an object of the invention to provide an arrangement<br>
through which address allocation in dynamical addressing<br>
systems can be provided for in a safer and more trustworthy<br>
manner than hitherto. Still further it is an object to provide<br>
an arrangement through which allocation of addresses can be<br>
provided for in a simple and a flexible manner. Another object<br>
is to provide an arrangement through which address allocation<br>
can be provided for in a fast and easy manner while still<br>
guaranteeing that one and the same address is not reused<br>
immediately upon release. Furthermore it is an object to<br>
provide an arrangement through which the number addresses that<br>
need to be kept in a pool for allocation purposes can be<br>
reduced while still meeting the prevailing requirements as to<br>
security during address allocation. It is also an object to<br>
provide an arrangement through which a large number of<br>
addresses can be handled and allocated in a safe manner.<br>
It is also an object of the invention to provide a node in a<br>
communications network through which one or more of the above<br>
mentioned objects can be fulfilled.<br>
Further yet it is an object of the invention to suggest a<br>
method for allocating addresses in a safe and reliable manner,<br>
and at the same time in a fast manner and preferably without<br>
requiring any increase in the number of addresses required in<br>
a pool as compared to known systems. It is also an object of<br>
the invention to suggest a method through which one or more of<br>
the above mentioned objects can be fulfilled.<br><br><br>
Therefore an arrangement as initially referred to is provided<br>
which comprises, for each pool of addresses, or address<br>
holding means holding a pool of addresses, delay means for<br>
allowing control of the minimum time period to lapse before an<br>
address having been allocated to a user is again reused, i.e.<br>
again allocated to a user, such that a minimum time period<br>
before reuse of each address can be guaranteed. Said delay<br>
means particularly comprises a limited, given number of timers<br>
and most particularly it comprises one timer.<br>
In a preferred implementation the address holding means holds<br>
addresses in at least three different states depending on the<br>
use status of the addresses. Most particularly the address<br>
holding means holds addresses in four different states. A<br>
first state comprises a state for holding addresses which are<br>
available for allocation to a user, a second state is a state<br>
for holding addresses occupied by users, a third state is a<br>
state for holding addresses released by a user, but not yet<br>
available for allocation, and finally a fourth state is a<br>
state for holding addresses in a waiting state. Particularly<br>
said one timer is used for activation of a transfer of all<br>
addresses of the, or a, pool, which addresses are held in said<br>
third, also denoted released, state, to said fourth, also<br>
denoted waiting, state upon expiry a first time, and for<br>
initiating transfer of all addresses held in said fourth,<br>
waiting, state to said first, available, state upon expiry of<br>
the timer the subsequent time. The allocation of addresses in<br>
said first available state to users can be done in different<br>
manners. In one implementation the lowest address held in said<br>
first state is selected or allocated to a user requesting an<br>
address. In an alternative embodiment an arbitrary address<br>
held in said first state is selected and allocated to a user<br><br><br>
requesting an address. Any appropriate algorithm or selection<br>
method can be used.<br>
Particularly an address is kept unused during a time period<br>
which is equal to or longer than a controllably selected delay<br>
time and shorter than or equal to twice the set delay time. In<br>
one implementation the delay time is (re)configurable whereas<br>
in other embodiments it is fixed. In one particular embodiment<br>
one single delay means or timer is used for all addresses<br>
handled by the arrangement (if there is one or more pools), or<br>
one for each pool if an arrangement comprises more than one<br>
pool.<br>
The arrangement is particularly implemented in or comprised by<br>
or associated (in communication) with a node in a mobile<br>
communication system (e.g. supporting communication of packet<br>
data) . The mobile system may for example be a GPRS or a UMTS<br>
system or CDMA 2000 etc.<br>
In one implementation the node in or in	association/<br>
communication with which the arrangement is	implemented<br>
comprises a GGSN (Gateway GPRS Support Node)	or a CGSN<br>
(Combined GPRS Support Node).<br>
In another implementation the arrangement is comprised by or<br>
associated or in communication with a server, e.g. a Radius-<br>
AAA server or a DHCP server. Particularly the addresses in the<br>
pool are IPv4 or IPv6 addresses. The concept can, however, of<br>
course also be implemented to other addresses as well as the<br>
arrangement can be implemented in or in communication with<br>
other nodes or servers or peers in general.<br><br><br>
Therefore also a node in a mobile communications system is<br>
suggested, the node being of a kind as initially referred to,<br>
comprising or communicating with an arrangement which<br>
comprises delay means for allowing control of the minimum time<br>
period to lapse before an address having been allocated to a<br>
user is reused, i.e. again allocated to a user, such that<br>
lapse of a minimum time period before reuse of each address<br>
can be guaranteed. Particularly said delay means comprises one<br>
single timer. The holding means preferably holds addresses in<br>
four different states, which particularly comprises a first<br>
state for holding addresses available for allocation to a<br>
user, a second state for holding addresses occupied by users,<br>
a third state for holding addresses released by users but not<br>
yet available for allocation, and a fourth state for holding<br>
addresses in a waiting state. Particularly said one (single)<br>
timer is used for activation of transfer of all addresses of<br>
the/a pool in which addresses are held in said third,<br>
released, state to said fourth waiting state upon a first<br>
expiry, and for activation of a transfer of all addresses from<br>
said fourth, waiting, state to said first available, state<br>
upon the subsequent expiry. The delay time may particularly be<br>
configurable. Alternatively it is fixed.<br>
In one embodiment the node comprises a packet data support<br>
node in a communications system supporting communication of<br>
packet data. Particularly it comprises a UMTS/GPRS GGSN or a<br>
CGSN or a node with a similar functionality. More generally it<br>
may comprise any peer node in a network with a functionality<br>
of allocating addresses to users. In one particular<br>
implementation it comprises a node with a server, or a server,<br>
such as for example a DHCP or a Radius AAA-server, allocating<br>
addresses in real time.<br><br><br>
The invention, in order to solve one or more of the objects<br>
referred to above, also provides a method, for, in a<br>
communications network, providing for allocation of addresses<br>
to users or clients. The method comprises the steps of;<br>
providing addresses in address holding means comprising a pool<br>
in or associated with a node or a server in the network;<br>
keeping the addresses in four different states depending on<br>
use status of the respective addresses; transferring all<br>
addresses kept in a third state in which the addresses are<br>
released from being allocated to a user, upon expiry of a<br>
timer, to a fourth, waiting, state; transferring all the<br>
addresses in the fourth, waiting, state upon expiry of said<br>
timer the subsequent time to a first, available, state, in<br>
which said addresses are available for allocation to users,<br>
such that, for each respective address, a minimum delay time<br>
before reuse of said address, can be guaranteed.<br>
The method particularly comprises the steps of, when a user or<br>
a client requests an address, allocating the lowest address in<br>
the first, available, state, in which addresses are held and<br>
for which at least the guaranteed minimum delay time has<br>
lapsed. Particularly the method comprises allocation of<br>
addresses substantially in real time. The addresses are<br>
particularly IPv4 or IPv6 addresses. The network particularly<br>
comprises a mobile communications network. The method may be<br>
implemented in nodes in a communication system supporting<br>
communication of packet data, such as network nodes, for<br>
example GGSNs or CGSNs or in servers, such as Radius servers<br>
or DHCP servers.<br>
Particularly the method comprises the step of; configuring the<br>
delay time, i.e. the timer expiration time.<br><br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Fig. 1 schematically illustrates an allocating arrangement 100<br>
according to the inventive concept with address holding means<br>
10 comprising an address pool in which addresses are kept in<br>
four different states.<br>
The allocating arrangement 100 may, as referred to earlier in<br>
the application, be provided in a network node, such as for<br>
example in a GGSN or a CGSN, it may be associated with or in<br>
communication with such node or any other node handling<br>
address allocation, or it may be provided in server means<br>
handling or allocating addresses, or it may be in<br>
communication with server means allocating or handling<br>
addresses. In Fig. 1 the four different states are<br>
illustrated, namely a first or available state, 1, a second or<br>
occupied state, 2, a third or released state, 3, and a fourth<br>
or waiting state, 4. Software is provided for keeping, at<br>
least, information about the different addresses in the<br>
different states, and as compared to a known systems, an<br>
additional parameter has to be configured, namely a minimum<br>
time period before individual addresses should be allowed to<br>
be reused. According to the invention the released state and<br>
the waiting state are separated in order to be able to avoid<br>
the use a timer, or starting a timer, for every separate<br>
address being handled. Generally, for example in GGSNs or<br>
other nodes performing the same functionality as far as<br>
addressing handling is confirmed, even hundreds of thousands<br>
of addresses may be used. Starting and handling one timer per<br>
address would therefore not be feasable, both due to<br>
limitations as far as storing capacity is concerned as well as<br>
processor utilization is concerned. If, thus, a combined<br>
released and waiting state were to be used, this would mean<br><br><br>
that several times more storing capacity would be required	per<br>
address. Thus, according to the inventive concept there is	one<br>
single timer for each allocating arrangement or one timer	per<br>
address holding means.<br>
It is in Fig. 1 supposed that addresses x0, X1, x3, x4, x5, Xi,<br>
X17 are in the first, available state meaning that they are all<br>
available for allocation to a network user. In order to<br>
explain the inventive concept, it is here supposed that a user<br>
requests an address and that, in any appropriate manner, an<br>
addresses is selected by the allocating arrangement, i.e.<br>
according to any criteria, arbitrarily or according to some<br>
algorithm. The inventive concept is not limited to any<br>
specific way of a selecting addresses for allocation from the<br>
available state 1. Thus, in this case it is supposed that<br>
address Xi is allocated. This handling is not illustrated in<br>
any figure, but merely the handling in the allocating<br>
arrangement since the address allocation itself is known and<br>
what is important for the inventive concept is how the<br>
addresses are handled in the allocating arrangement. Thus,<br>
since an address xi is selected and allocated, it is put in the<br>
second, occupied state 2, the addresses in which state are<br>
considered to be utilized in for example the GPRS network, in<br>
the GGSN and all connected, external networks. An address<br>
enters the second, occupied, state 2 at any time when it is<br>
allocated to a user. In this case it is supposed that<br>
addresses x2, x6, x7, x8, x11, xi for the moment are handled in<br>
the second, occupied state 2. It is subsequently supposed that<br>
the user to whom address xi has been allocated disconnects or<br>
is disconnected, xi is then released and transferred from the<br>
second, occupied, state 2 to the third, released state 3. The<br>
released state 3 is a state which is used to hold an address<br>
before it is transferred to the waiting state 4. Addresses are<br><br><br>
entered into the released state 2 at any time when a user<br>
disconnects or is disconnected. An address in the released<br>
state 2 is considered to be released, for example, in the<br>
GGSN, the GPRS network and all connected external networks. In<br>
the released state 2 the address will not be allocated. In<br>
this particular embodiment it is supposed that addresses x9,<br>
x10, x14, xi are in the third, released state. It is then<br>
supposed that the one or single timer expires. Expiry of the<br>
timer (as far as addresses in the third state are concerned)<br>
then initiates a substantially simultaneous transfer of all<br>
addresses in the third, released state, to the fourth, waiting<br>
state, i.e. addresses x9, x10, x11, Xi are all transferred at one<br>
and the same time. An address kept in the waiting state is<br>
considered to be released in the GGSN, the GPRS network and<br>
all connected external networks. Thus, when the timer expires<br>
once more, addresses x9, x10, x14, xi are all substantially<br>
simultaneously transferred to the first, available, state 1.<br>
It should be clear that this figure is shown as referring to<br>
different moments of time for the respective states and it is<br>
intended to illustrate the procedure when an address (xi) is<br>
transferred from one state to another.<br>
If for example two addresses are considered, address al used<br>
by mobile user A and address b1 used by a mobile user B, the<br>
procedure might e.g. be as follows: The user A with address al<br>
disconnects. The address al is then substantially immediately<br>
transferred to the released state. It is subsequently supposed<br>
that the single timer expires and address al is then<br>
transferred to the waiting state. Then user B with address bl<br>
disconnects and address bl enters the released state. Then the<br>
single timer expires again. Address bl then enters the waiting<br>
state whereas when the timer expires al enters the available<br>
state, i.e. it is the second time that the timer expires as<br><br><br>
far as address a1 is concerned, whereas it is the first time<br>
that it expires as far as address b1 is concerned. In both<br>
cases, of course, also all other addresses in the released<br>
state, enter the available state at the same time, whereas all<br>
the other addresses in the waiting state at the same time<br>
enter the available state upon expiry of the timer.<br>
The delay is the minimum time period that should lapse before<br>
an address is reused. The length of the delay could be<br>
configurable or fixed. Generally a long delay has the impact<br>
that addresses will be held longer and more addresses will be<br>
needed. If for example 100 mobile stations are connecting and<br>
requesting an address every second and 100 mobile stations are<br>
disconnecting and releasing an address every second and with,<br>
for example, a delay of 60 seconds before reuse, 60x100=6000<br>
addresses will be requested before the timer expires and<br>
released state addresses are put in waiting state. That is<br>
however the best case, the actual moment in time at which an<br>
address is released has to be considered. If the single timer<br>
expires at 00:00, then an address released at 00:01 will<br>
actually be held for 59 seconds and then put into the waiting<br>
state for 60 seconds. To calculate the worst case, the delay<br>
will be doubled; then 60x2x100=12.000 addresses will be<br>
required.<br>
As referred to above, an arrangement according to the present<br>
invention can be implemented in a number of different ways.<br>
Fig. 2 illustrates an address allocating arrangement 1001 as<br>
implemented in an office network environment. Any computer,<br>
e.g. iMAC 200A, workstation 200B, server 200C, mobile user<br>
station 200D, and Laptop 200E are supposed to send a DHCP<br>
protocol defined request for an address. The request will<br>
arrive at the DHCP server which here uses the address<br><br><br>
allocation procedure as described above, the request will be<br>
answered and then the IP address is provided in the response<br>
to the request. It should be clear that the implementation of<br>
the inventive concept is not as advantageous in such an<br>
environment as it would be in an environment where there are<br>
many short connections, for example in wireless networks.<br>
However, for example for tracking purposes, addresses may be<br>
required to be held for a particular amount of time and<br>
therefore the inventive concept may also with advantage be<br>
implemented in such systems.<br>
Fig. 3 schematically illustrates the implementation of the<br>
inventive concept in a mobile communications system. A mobile<br>
station, MS1 210A, which here comprises a handheld computer or<br>
MS2 210B, which here comprises a mobile telephone, may connect<br>
to the radio base station 93, which communicates with a<br>
switching arrangement 92 which in turn sets up a connection<br>
between the mobile station MS1 or MS2 and, here, SGSN 91. When<br>
this has been done, in any conventional manner, it is supposed<br>
that the mobile station is attached but still not connected.<br>
It is supposed that a mobile station MS1 or MS2 initiates a<br>
connection for being connected to the network for data<br>
transfer, e.g. Internet browsing, sending of e-mail etc. The<br>
GGSN 90 (Gateway GPRS Support Node) will then be contacted by<br>
SGSN 91 to request access for example to Internet and<br>
optionally an IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) from the Radius server<br>
1102. GGSN 90 then sends a request to the Radius server to get<br>
an IP address and the Radius server 1102 then launches the<br>
process of allocating an IP address using allocating<br>
arrangement 1002 according to the inventive concept including<br>
the guaranteed delay functionality. The Radius server 1102<br>
thus, in this implementation, uses the inventive address<br><br><br>
allocation procedure to provide an address to the mobile<br>
station. The Radius server 1102 will then fetch an address in<br>
the time delay address allocating arrangement 1002 comprising<br>
an address pool 102 (address holding means). The fetched<br>
address is forwarded via GGSN 90, SGSN 91, switch 92 and base<br>
station 93 to the mobile station, MS1 or MS2. The allocated<br>
address may advantageously be shared/used in multimedia and<br>
charging nodes, (e.g. a multimedia server 111) in an optional,<br>
advantageous embodiment. In such embodiments, the multimedia<br>
and/or charging systems may be informed of the allocated IP<br>
address. Since such systems may hold on to the address after<br>
an address is released, the time delay guaranteed allocation<br>
procedure according to the inventive concept can with<br>
advantage be implemented.<br>
At a subsequent stage it is supposed that the mobile station<br>
disconnects from Internet or stops data transfer. Thus, the<br>
MS, having finished using data e.g. Internet or e-mail,<br>
forwards a request to disconnect, which will reach SGSN 91.<br>
SGSN 91 then requests GGSN 90 to release the IP address it<br>
previously had allocated. GGSN 90 then forwards a request to<br>
the Radius server 1102 to release the IP address. The Radius<br>
server informs the address allocating arrangement 1002 and then<br>
the procedure will be as described with the reference to Fig.<br>
1 above. In the particularly illustrated embodiment it is<br>
supposed that the address allocating arrangement 1002 is<br>
associated with and in communication with the Radius server<br>
1102. In an alternative implementation the address allocating<br>
arrangement could have been arranged in a node comprising the<br>
Radius server and the address allocation arrangement (and<br>
possibly other elements).<br>
15<br><br>
Fig. 4A shows an alternative implementation of the inventive<br>
concept in which the address allocating arrangement 1003 is<br>
associated with or communicates with GGSN 903 instead of with<br>
radio server 1103. Also in this embodiment it should be clear<br>
that the address allocating arrangement 1003 alternatively<br>
could have been provided in the GGSN node 93. In this<br>
embodiment also the allocation control means 1053 are<br>
illustrated; they could of course also be included in the<br>
other embodiments, but they can function in any known or<br>
appropriate manner, performing the actual allocation once an<br>
address has been provided according to the inventive concept<br>
and establishing when a user disconnects etc.<br>
The embodiment of Fig. 4A will in the following be explained.<br>
It is supposed that a mobile station MS1 220A or MS2 220B<br>
attaches to the network by first connecting to the base<br>
station 933. The base station 933 communicates with the<br>
switching arrangement 923, which in turns sets up a connection<br>
from the mobile station (MS1 or MS2) with the SGSN 913. As in<br>
the preceding embodiment, the mobile station at this stage is<br>
considered to be attached but not connected.<br>
In a subsequent step it is supposed that the mobile station<br>
MS1/MS2 initiates a connection for data, i.e. browsing the<br>
Internet, sending of e-mail etc. GGSN 903 will then be<br>
contacted by SGSN 913 to request for Internet access and<br>
optionally an IP address (IPv4 or IPv6). GGSN 903 will then be<br>
requested to provide an IP address and initiates the process<br>
of allocating an IP address according to the inventive concept<br>
by GGSN 903 requesting allocation of an address form the<br>
address allocating arrangement 1003, as described with<br>
reference to for example Fig. 1. The address will be forwarded<br><br><br>
via SGSN 913, switching arrangement 923, base station 933 to<br>
mobile station MS1 or MS2.<br>
As in the preceding embodiment the address allocated may be<br>
shared or used in multimedia and/or charging nodes.<br>
Subsequently, when the mobile station disconnects e.g. from<br>
Internet or stops data transfer, it will forward a request to<br>
disconnect, which reaches the SGSN 913 (it should be clear that<br>
the MS may also be disconnected by the network etc. It does of<br>
course not matter whether the disconnection is initiated from<br>
the MS side or from the network side, the important thing<br>
being that it is disconnected) . However, it is supposed that<br>
SGSN 913 requests that GGSN releases the previously allocated<br>
IP address and GGSN then sends a release request to the<br>
address allocating arrangement 1003 as discussed above, and the<br>
procedure will continue as discussed for example with<br>
reference to Fig. 1.<br>
Fig. 4B shows an implementation similar to that of Fig. 4A,<br>
but with the difference that the SGSN and the GGSN are<br>
combined in a GGSN (combined GPRS support node) including both<br>
the functionality of an SGSN and a GGSN. In this case it is<br>
also illustrated that the address allocating arrangement IOO4<br>
with address pool 104 and the allocation control means 1054 is<br>
provided in the CGSN 904. Of course, the address allocating<br>
arrangement 1004 might alternatively be provided externally of<br>
the SGSN, cf. Fig. 4A, and it is here supposed that the GGSN<br>
904 communicates with one or more servers, here merely<br>
schematically illustrated a server 1104, it being of no<br>
importance of the functioning of the inventive concept. In<br>
other respects the functioning is similar to that described<br>
above with reference to Figs. 1-4A. (In Figs. 2,3,4A the<br><br><br>
allocating arrangement might of course also be provided in the<br>
node itself.)<br>
Fig. 5 shows a relation between delay and number of addresses<br>
required or used. It is illustrated with reference to a time<br>
scale and it is supposed that there is one single timer T1.<br>
Thus, it is supposed that at 00:00:00 T1 expires. At<br>
t=00:00:00 it is supposed that address 1.1.1.1. is released.<br>
It then more or less instantaneously enters the state<br>
released. Somewhat later, t=00:00:59 it is supposed that<br>
address 2.2.2.2. is released and more or less instantaneously<br>
enters the state released. Then, when t=00:01:00, it is<br>
supposed that Tl expires (with respect to these addresses, the<br>
first time). Addresses 1.1.1.1. and 2.2.2.2. which both are in<br>
state released, then simultaneously are transferred to the<br>
waiting state. After lapse of a further expiration period for<br>
Tl, when t=00:02:00, Tl expires for the second time for the<br>
respective addresses. This initiates transfer of addresses<br>
1.1.1.1. and 2.2.2.2. in the waiting state to the available<br>
state. Subsequently Tl expires at t=00:03:00, which however<br>
does not affect the addresses in question.<br>
This shows the relation between delay and the number of<br>
addresses used. In the "worst" case, when an address is<br>
released at the relative start of a cycle, the actual time<br>
before the address enters the available state is almost twice<br>
the delay time. Address 1.1.1.1. here illustrates the "worst"<br>
case when an address is released substantially at that the<br>
beginning of a cycle of the timer, whereas address 2.2.2.2.<br>
shows the "best" case where an address is released<br>
substantially at the end of the cycle of the timer. It should<br>
be clear that this figure is extremely simplified and it is<br><br><br>
merely included to illustrate the relationships and "worst"<br>
and "best" case respectively.<br>
Fig. 6 is a flow diagram schematically illustrating the<br>
procedure when a mobile station requests allocation of an<br>
address, and how said address is handled in the address<br>
allocating arrangement. Thus, it is supposed that MS request<br>
an address, 101. In this embodiment, it is supposed that e.g.<br>
a GGSN requests the address from the address allocating<br>
arrangement, 102. It should be clear that it does not have to<br>
be a GGSN, it might just as well be a CGSN or a server such as<br>
a Radius server or a DHCP etc, or more generally any peer/node<br>
handling allocation of addresses. The address allocating<br>
arrangement then selects an address, for example arbitrarily,<br>
among the addresses held in the first, available state, 103.<br>
Once selected, the address is forwarded, in this case, via<br>
GGSN to MS, 104A (via SGSN etc.). In the address allocating<br>
arrangement the selected address is transferred to state<br>
occupied, i.e. the second state, 104B. This is supposed to<br>
take place substantially simultaneously. It is also, supposed<br>
that MS remains connected for some time, 105A. In the<br>
meanwhile, the selected address is kept in state occupied,<br>
104. However, after some time it is supposed that MS<br>
disconnects, 106A. The selected, previously allocated address,<br>
is then released and transferred to state released.<br>
Subsequently, when the single timer of the address allocating<br>
arrangement expires, the selected address is, together with<br>
all other addresses in state released, transferred to state<br>
waiting, 106B. Subsequently, when timer T1 expires the next<br>
time, the selected address is transferred to state available<br>
together with all other addresses in the waiting state, 106C.<br><br><br>
It should be clear that the invention of course not is limited<br>
to the specific, illustrated embodiments but that it can be<br>
varied in a number of ways within the scope of the appended<br>
claims. It is an advantage of the invention that addresses can<br>
be allocated substantially in real time at a high rate, and<br>
that for each address a delay time can be guaranteed during<br>
which the address is not reallocated. This may be particularly<br>
advantageous for IPv6 address allocation, since there will be<br>
even more addresses allocations when there is an almost<br>
unlimited amount of IPv6 addresses and therefore address<br>
allocation rates will presumably increase. It should also be<br>
clear that the inventive concept can be implemented in or by<br>
every node handling address allocation. It should also be<br>
clear that address allocation (selection) itself can be<br>
performed using any algorithm among the addresses in state<br>
available. Also in other aspects numerous variations are<br>
possible.<br>
It is an advantage of the invention that a delay time can be<br>
guaranteed for every address in any traffic scenario. It is<br>
also an advantage that fewer addresses will be required if<br>
circular address allocation schemes are implemented.<br><br>
