DESCRIPTION<br>
NITRIDE SEMICONDUCTOR LASER DEVICE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a laser device made of a nitride semiconductor (AlbIncGa1-b-cN, 0<b b c .></b>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
'Recently, nitride semiconductor laser devices capable of oscillating in blue wavelength region have been receiving much attention. Also there have recently been demands for a nitride semiconductor laser device that has a high output power. To meet these demands, a laser having ridge structure formed by partially etching a p-type contact layer and a part of a p-type cladding layer has been studied so as to achieve single transverse oscillation mode having good FFP (far field pattern) .<br>
However, the ridge has a very small width, from 1 um to 2u m, and it is difficult to form an ohmic electrode having the same width as that of this ridge . To circumvent this difficulty, a p-type ohmic electrode that contacts with a nitride semiconductor only on the top surface of the ridge has been formed, by covering the entire nitride semiconductor except for the end face with an insulation film with only an n-electrode forming surface being left exposed, then forming the electrode<br><br>
that has a roughly determined width on the ridge. Then a pad electrode of 2-layer structure is formed on the p-type ohmic electrode by forming an Au film on an Au or Ni film.<br>
With the nitride semiconductor laser device of the prior art, however, since the insulation film that covers the entire nitride semiconductor except for the end face needs to have a thickness not less than a certain value in order to protect the device, there has been such a problem that an aperture cannot be precisely formed on the top surface of the ridge, and therefore it is difficult to precisely control the width of contact between the p-type ohmic el'ectrode and the p-type contact layer. Thus it has been difficult to manufacture a laser device with minimum variations in the device characteristics.<br>
Also there has been such a problem that heat generated when the laser device is powered causes Au atoms of the pad electrode to gradually diffuse into a layer underneath, resulting in deterioration of the device characteristics. Particularly when mounting a laser device face-down, conspicuous deterioration of the device characteristics occurs since the diffusion of Au is accelerated by heating to a temperature of about 350°C for the purpose of face-down mount.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a nitride semiconductor laser device that has high reliability with less<br><br>
deterioration of the device characteristics, where the width of contact portion between a p-type ohmic electrode and a p-type contact layer can be precisely controlled.<br>
In order to achieve the object described above, the nitride semiconductor laser device of the present invention comprises an n-type nitride semiconductor layer, an active layer and a p-type nitride semiconductor layer, that are formed successively on a substrate, with a ridge that includes at least a p-type contact layer in the top layer being formed in the p-type nitride semiconductor layer, and a p-type ohmic electrode that makes ohmic contact with the p-type contact layer formed on the ridge being formed substantially parallel to the direction of resonance, wherein a first insulation film that has an aperture formed at a position over the ridge is formed so as to cover at least the side face a proximate region outside the side face of the ridge, the p-type ohmic electrode is formed so as to make contact with the p-type contact layer through the aperture, and a second insulation film is formed on the first insulation film.<br>
The constitution described above makes it possible to precisely control the width of contact between the p-type ohmic electrode and the p-type contact layer by forming the first insulation film precisely, and effectively protect the device. by means of the second insulation film formed on the first insulation film, thereby achieving the nitride semiconductor laser device that has stable characteristics and high reliability.<br><br>
In the nitride semiconductor laser device of the present invention, the second insulation film may be formed in continuation with a resonating end face so as to form a laser reflection plane on the resonating end face.<br>

In the nitride semiconductor laser device of the present invention, such a process may be employed as the second insulation film is formed so as to have an aperture located over the p-type ohmic electrode and the p-type pad electrode is formed so as to make contact with the p-type ohmic electrode through the aperture.<br>

formed so as to have an aperture at a position located over the p-type ohmic electrode and the p-type pad electrode is formed so as to make contact with the p-type ohmic electrode through the aperture.<br>
In the nitride semiconductor laser device of the present invention, the p-type pad electrode may also be constituted from the bonding layer formed from Rh or RhO in contact with the p-type ohmic electrode, and the Au layer formed on the bonding layer.<br>
This constitution results in improved heat resistance of the p-type ohmic electrode and the p-type pad electrode.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br><br>
Now the semiconductor laser diode according to an embodiment of the present invention will be described below with reference to the accompanying drawings. Fig. 1 is a schematic sectional view showing the constitution of a semiconductor laser diode according to this embodiment, showing a cross section perpendicular to the direction of laser oscillation.<br>
The semiconductor laser diode of this embodiment is constituted from a plurality of semiconductor layers comprising a buffer layer (not shown) , an n-type contact layer 2, an n-type cladding layer 3, an n-type optical guide layer 4, an active layer 5, a'p-type cap layer 6, a p-type optical guide layer 1, a p-type cladding layer 8 and a p-type contact layer 9, formed successively as shown in Fig. 1, wherein a p-type ohmic electrode 20 is formed, so as to make contact with the p-type contact layer 9 through an aperture 30a of a first insulation film 30, on the p-type contact layer 9 having a ridge shape that is long enough in the direction of resonance, and an n-type ohmic electrode 21 is formed so as to make contact with the n-type contact layer 2 through an aperture 30b of the first insulation film 30, on the n-type contact layer 2 that has been exposed by etching.<br>
The semiconductor laser diode of this embodiment is further provided with a second insulation film 31 that has apertures 31a, 31b at positions located over the p-type ohmic electrode 20 and the n-type ohmic electrode 21, respectively, while a p-type pad electrode 22 and an n-type pad electrode 23<br><br>
are formed in electrical continuity with the p-type ohmic electrode 20 and the n-type ohmic electrode 21, respectively, via the apertures 31a, 31b.<br>
In the semiconductor laser diode of this embodiment, the first insulation film 30 is formed mainly for the purpose of putting the p-type ohmic electrode 20 in satisfactory contact with the top surface of the p-type contact layer 9 (to ensure the accuracy in the shape of the area that makes ohmic contact) , and is required to have enough heat resistance since annealing is required after forming the p-type ohmic electrode 20.<br>
Since the firsfinsulation film 30 is formed on both sides of the ridge, refractive index of the first insulation film 30 must be lower than that of the p-type nitride semiconductor that constitutes the ridge (preferably as near to the dielectric constant of vacuum as possible)•<br>
Moreover, since the first insulation film 30 is formed near the ridge and it is necessary to form the aperture 30a with a high accuracy, the first insulation film 30 must be thin. For<br>
example, since the ridge is normally about 1.5 um and 0.5 u m in width and height, respectively, the thickness of the first<br>
insulation film 30 is set to 0.5 um  or less.<br>
In the semiconductor laser diode of this embodiment, the second insulation film 31 is formed mainly for the purpose of protecting the device, and is therefore made of a material that has effective protective function.<br>
In this embodiment, the second insulation film 31 has the<br><br>
apertures 31a, 31b formed therein at positions above the p-type ohmic electrode 20 and the n-type ohmic electrode 21, respectively, while the p-type pad electrode and the n-type pad electrode are formed in electrical continuity with the p-type ohmic electrode 20 and the n-type ohmi'electrode 21, respectively, via the apertures 31a, 31b.<br>
However, since the aperture 31a used for the continuity between the p-type ohmic electrode 20 and the p-type pad electrode and the aperture 31b used for the continuity between the n-type ohmic electrode 21 and the n-type 'and electrode are not required to have such a high dimensional accuracy as that of the aperture 30a of the first insulation film 30, the second insulation film 31 may be formed with a relatively large thickness.<br>
Moreover, since the second insulatior. film 31 is not<br>
subjected to annealing after being formed as in the case of the first insulation film, the second insulation film 31 is not required to have as high heat resistance as the first insulation film 30.<br>
Therefore, the second insulation film 31 may be made of a material that can effectively perform protective function, selected on the basis of appropriateness for the semiconductor laser diode.<br>
In the semiconductor laser diode of this embodiment, the p-type pad electrode 22 comprises three layers of a bonding layer 22a that makes contact with the p-type atomic electrode.<br><br>
a barrier layer 22b and an Au layer 22c,<br>
In this embodiment, the bonding layer 22a of the p-type pad electrode 22 is made of such a material that bonds well with the second insulation film 31 that is formed on the ridge and with the p-type ohmic electrode 20, and is less likely t: for which preferable candidates are Ni, Cu, Ru, Ru Zr, Rh and RhO. When the second insulation film is iv oxide, in particular, the most preferable material is has high bonding characteristic with the second insula' In order to improve the heat resistance of the p-type electrode 22, the bonding layer 22a is preferably m or RhO.<br>
The thickness of the bonding layer 22a is pref a range from 100 A to 5000 A, most from 500 A to 2^<br>
When the bonding layer 22a is made of Rh or Rh layer or the RhO layer also functions as a barrier 1 prevents the Au layer 22G from diffusing. Therefore, bonding layer 22a is made of Rh or RhO, the barrier can be omitted so as to constitute the p-type pad ele from two layers of the Rh layer or RhO layer and the 22c.<br>
When the p-type pad electrode 22 is constitutec layers of the Rh layer or RhO layer and the Au layer resistance of the p-type pad electrode 22 can be made e
 <br>
When the p-type pad electrode 22 is constituted from two layers of the combination described above, the thickness of the Rh layer or RhO layer is preferably in a range from 100 A to 10000 A, and the thickness of the Au layer 22c is preferably from 1000 A to 30000 A.<br>
According to the present invention, the barrier layer 22b of the p-type pad electrode 22 is made of such a high-melting point metal as Au atoms in the top layer does not diffuse into the bonding layer or the lower layers or a nitride thereof, for example, Ti, Pt, W, Ta, Mo or TiN, and most preferably Ti, The thickness is preferably in a range from 100 A to 5000 A, most preferably from 500 A to 2000 A.<br>
When the bonding layer 22a is made of Rh or RhO, as described above, the barrier layer 22a may be omitted.<br>
The Au layer 22c located at the top of the p-type pad electrode 22 is the best material for wire bonding of the nitride semiconductor device. The thickness of the Au layer -is preferably in a range from 1000 A to 20000 A, more preferably from 5000 A to 10000 A.<br>
According to the present invention, the p-type ohmic electrode 20 is made of at least one kind selected from a group consisting of Ni, Co, Fe, Ti and Cu, and Au. Ni, Co, Fe, Ti and Cu are all metal elements that can turn into ions having valence of 2. After forming layers from one kind selected from a group consisting of Ni, Co, Fe,Ti and Cu, and Au one on another, the layers are annealed to form an alloy, so that good ohmic<br><br>
contact with the p-type nitride semiconductor layer is achieved. Annealing is carried out at a temperature at which the nitride semiconductor is not subjected to an adverse effect such as dissociation of In from InGaN that is grown before forming the ohmic electrode, preferably in a range from 400°C to 700°C, more preferably from 500cC to 650°C. Best ohmic characteristic of the p-type ohmic electrode 20 can be achieved by selecting Ni from the group of metals described above and using Ni and Au. Since the alloy, that is formed by annealing the layers of Ni and Au formed one on another, includes Ni, the best structure may be obtained when the bonding layer 22a of the p-type pad electrode 22 formed through partial contact with the p-type ohmic electrode is made from Ni, which leads to higher bonding strength between Ni atoms. The total thickness of the layers made of one of the group of metals described above or Ni and Au is preferably in a range from 150 A to 5000 A, most preferably 1500 A.<br>
When an RhO layer is formed as the bonding layer 22a, it is preferable to form the p-type pad electrode after forming the RhO layer on the Au layer of the p-type ohmic electrode 20 and then annealing the layers.<br>
The heat resistance of the p-type pad electrode 22 can be improved further by making the p-type ohmic electrode 20 in Ni-Au-Rh structure and forming the p-type pad electrode 22 that includes the RhO layer as the bonding layer 22a.<br>
Electrode characteristics of various combinations of the<br><br>
constitution of the p-type ohraic electrode 20 and the constitution of the p-type pad electrode described above are shown in Table 1 in comparison with regard to heat resistance.<br>
The heat resistance of the p-type pad electrode was evaluated in terms of the temperature at which the ohmic characteristic changed.<br>
Change in the ohmic characteristic was observed by forming a p-type ohmic electrode and a p-type pad electrode at a predetermined distance from each other on a p-type gallium nitride compound semiconductor layer, and measuring the resistance between the two electrodes.<br><br>
The thickness was set as follows for the Ni, Au and RhO layers of the p-type pad electrode and the p-type ohmic electrode that were used in the test summarized in Table 1.<br><br>
Ni layer thickness wn.s set to 100 A and Au layer thickness was set to 1300 A for the p-t:v'pe ohmic electrode of No.l through No.10.<br>
Ni layer thickness was set to 100 A, Au layer thickness was set to 650 A and RhO layer thickness was set to 1500 A for the p-type ohmic electrode of No. 11 through No. 16.<br>
The thickness of the layer corresponding to the bondi-ng layer and the barrier layer was set to 1500 A and Au layer was set to 6000 A for the p-type Pad electrode shown in Table 1. Data of Nos.l and 2 in Table 1 are shown for comparison. Presence of AuSn is shown by whether AuSn is soldered (Present) or not (No) on the p-type pad electrode, since heat resistance often deteriorates after soldering of AuSn.<br>
. As described above, forming the p-type pad electrode from<br>
RhO-Au or RhO-Pt-Au makes is possible to prevent alloying with<br>
the p-type ohmic electrode and prevent AuSn, that is usually<br>
used for the connection of '-he p-type pad electrode with other<br>
electrodes, from diffusing into the p-type ohmic electrode.<br>
Therefore, forming the p-type pad electrode from RhO-<br>
Au or RhO-Pt-Au makes it possible to prevent service life from<br>
deteriorating due to the p-type ohmic electrode and the p-type<br>
pad electrode and achieve the nitride semiconductor laser diode<br>
of longer service life.<br>
In order to study the relationship between the heat resistance and service life of  the p-type ohmic electrode and the p-type pad electrode, a laser diode (LDl) having the p-<br><br>
type ohmic electrode and the p-type pad elctrode shown as No. 7 in Table 1 and a laser diode (LD2) having the p-type ohmic electrode and the p-type ad electrode shown as no.3 in table 1 were made and tested to determine the service life under the conditions of continuous oscillation with W of output power at 50°C. In a test after connecting by wire bonding, the LDl showed service life of 5934 hours in averageo three samples and LD2 showed service life of 1805 hours in average of three samples.<br>
In a test after connecting by flip hip bonding, the LDl<br>
showed service life of 334 6 hours in average of three samples.<br>
The n-type pad electrode 23 comprises three layers of a<br>
bonding layer 23a, a barrier layer 23b and an Au layer 23c.<br>

n-type contact layer, and with the n-typeohmic electrode 21<br>
and is less likely to diffuse.  In case te second insulation<br>

The constitution of the n-type pad electrode 23 may be the same as or different from the constitution of the p-typ pad electrode'22. But it is preferable to make » he n-type pad electrode 23 in the same constitution as that of thetypead electrode 22, since the laser device manufacturirngprocess ca be simplified thereby.<br>
According to the present invention, the n-type o electrode 21 may be made by forming Ti and Au J ayers one another that are materials having high ohmic contact capability with the n-type nitride semiconductor and righ bonding characteristic.  In order to improve the ohmic criaracteris further, the layers are preferably annealed so  as to form an alloy.

Other materials that have high ohmic contact capability and high bonding characteristic Lnclude alloys made by annealing layers of W/Al, Ti/Au, V/Al, V/Au or the like, and single elements such<br>

According to the present invention, annealing of the p-type ohmic electrode and the n-type ohmic electrode is preferably carried out in oxygen atmosphere since good ohmic characteristic can be obtained by supplying oxygen.<br>

In this embodiment, the first insulation film 30 that covers the nitride semiconductor such as the p-type nitride semiconductor layer where the ridge is formed is preferably made of an oxide that can endure the annealing temperature. The second insulation film 31 is also preferably made of an oxide, such as Si02 or Ti02. When the second insulation film 31 is made of an oxide, strong bondj ng can be achieved between the bonding layers of the p-type pad electrode and the n-type pad electrode. The second insulation film oa.'n also be made of the same material and in the same process as thereflector film formed on the resonating end face of the laser, in which case it is preferably formed in a multi-layered filof SiO2and TiO^. Specifically,<br><br>
two pairs of SiOs film 700 A thick and TiOs film 400 A thick (Si02/Ti02) may be formed one on another, so that the portion at the end face functions as a reflector film and the rest functions as a protective film.<br>
According to the present invention, the pair of {Si02/Ti02) may also be stacked more than two times, and the second insulation film 31 that can also function as the reflector film of the laser is not limited to the pair of (3102/1102)/ as a matter of course.<br>
Now other constitutions according to this embodiment will be described below. It needs not to say that the present invention is not limited to the constitutions described below.<br>
The substrate may be made of a different material such as sapphire, or may be a GaN substrate that is made by a known process. A buffer layer made of GaN is preferably formed on the substrate, which enables it to achieve good crystallinity o.f nitride semiconductor to be formed on the substrate later. The buffer layer is particularly effective when forming the nitride semiconductor on the substrate of a different material. The substrate of different material refers to a substrate made of a material other than the nitride semiconductor.<br>
The nitride semiconductor of the present invention may<br>
be formed in any layer structure. The nitride semiconductor<br>
maybe grown by a vapor phase growth process such as metal organic<br>
vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE) or hydride vapor phase epitaxy<br>
(HDCVD).<br><br>
The n-type contact layer is used to form the n-type electrode, so as to improve the ohmic characteristic by doping with an n-type impurity such as Si. After forming the p-type layer, the p-type layer is etched so as to expose a part of the n-type contact layer, and the n-type electrode is formed on the exposed n-type contact layer.<br>
A crack prevention layer is formed on the n-type contact layer in order to reduce the occurrence of cracks in the substrate by making undoped constitution. The crack prevention layer may also be made of InGaN or the like so as to have a refractive index different from that of the n-type cladding layer, so that light emitted from the active layer is prevented from reflecting on the substrate of different material and returning into the nitride semiconductor layer. This layer may be omitted.<br>
The n-type cladding layer may be formed either in a single layer doped with an n-type impurity such as Si or in a super lattice structure consisting of an undoped layer and a layer doped with an n-type impurity formed one on another, so as to function as a layer that supplies electrons to the active layer as well as a layer that confines carrier and light in the active layer.<br>
The n-type optical guide layer constitutes an optical waveguide together with the active layer, by compensating for the reduced thickness of the active layer of multiple quantum well structure or the like. Therefore, the n-type optical guide<br><br>
layer is made in such a constitution that has a sufficient difference in refractive index from the n-type cladding layer and less difference in refractive index from the active layer that formed above. This layer may be doped with an n-type impurity or undoped, and may also be formed in a super lattice structure consisting of an undoped layer and a layer doped with an n-type impurity formed one on another.<br>
The active layer is formed in single quantum well structure made of InGaN or multiple quantum well structure that includes at least a well layer made of InGaN and a barrier layer. When formed in multiple quantum well structure, either one or both of the well layer and the barrier layer may be doped with impurity. Preferably the barrier layer is doped with an impurity which decreases the threshold current. . The well layer is formed with the thickness of 30 to 60 A and the barrier layer is formed to the thickness of 90 to 150 A.<br>
An active layer having multiple quantum well structure may start with a barrier layer and end with a well layer, start with a barrier layer and end with a barrier layer, start with a well layer and end with a barrier layer, or start with a well layer and end with a well layer. Preferably, the active layer comprises two to five pairs of well layer and barrier layer stacked one on another starting with a barrier layer, more preferably three pairs of well layer and barrier layer stacked one on another, which results in decreased threshold value and longer service life.<br><br>
The- p-type cap layer provided on the active layer is capable of replenishing positive holes that tend to be less than electrons supplied from the n side to the active layer by heavily doping with p-type impurity such as Mg, Increasing the concentration of the p-type impurity higher than in the p-type optical guide layer and in the p-type cladding layer results in diffusion of the p-type impurity into the p-type layer formed on the p-type cap layer, and is preferable. Moreover, this layer has an effect of suppressing the dissociation of In of the active layer. When this function is intended as the main objective, the layer may be left undoped. The p-type cap layer may also be omitted.<br>
The p-type optical guide layer that includes a p-type impurity such as Mg may be either intentionally doped with the p-type impurity or formed without doping, since the p-type impurity diffuses from the p-type cap layer when the p-type cap layer is doped with the p-type impurity. The p-type optical guide layer, that is provided for the purpose of forming the optical guide layer similarly to the n-type optical guide layer, and is made in such a constitution that has a sufficient difference in refractive index from the p-type cladding layer and less difference in refractive index from the active layer that formed underneath.<br>
The p-type cladding layer serves as a positive hole supplying layer for the active layer, and can be formed either in a single layer doped with a p-type impurity such as Mg or<br><br>
in a super lattice structure cDtisisting of an undoped layer and a layer doped with a p-type impurity formed one on another.<br>
The p-type contact layer is provided for the purpose of forming the p-type electrode, and can have good ohmic contact with the p-type electrode when 'ioped with a p-type impurity such as Mg relatively heavily.<br>
In the semiconductor las'er diode of this embodiment having the constitution described above, the first insulation film 30 is formed for the purpose of forming a portion of the p-type contact layer 9 that makes ohmic contact with the p-type ohmic electrode 20 with ^J high accuracy, and the second insulation film 31 is formed f^^r the purpose of protecting the device. Since this allows it i:o select the best material and configuration (thickness, etc.) for the functions of the first insulation film 30 and the secod insulation film 31, stable laser oscillation can be achjeved, short circuiting due to insufficient insulation can be- prevented and leakage current can be decreased, thus resulting in the semiconductor laser diode having high reliability.<br>
In the semiconductor laser diode of this embodiment, each of the p-type pad electrode 22 and the n-type pad electrode 23 is constituted from three layers of a bonding layer that is made of a high-melting point metal or nitride thereof and bonds well with the p-type ohmic electrode or n-type ohmic electrode and the second insulation film 31, a barrier layer that prevents diffusion of Au from the layer formed thereon and an Au layer.<br><br>
With this constitution, bonding performan with the ohmic electrode and the second insulation film 31 can be made higher, and diffusion of Au due to heat generated by the current supplied can be prevented, deterioration of the characteristics can be prevented and reliability can be improved-Variations<br>
In the nitride semiconductor laser device or t e embodiment described above, the p-type ohmic electrode 20 is formed on the top surface of the ridge. But the  present invention is not limited to this constitution, and the p-type ohmic electrode 20 may also be formed so as to cover the tire ridge and extends over the p-type cladding layer 8 on both sides of the ridge, as shown in Fig. 2.<br>
zperations and effects similar to those of the embodiments can be achieved also with such a constition'<br>

Then a protective film of SiOs is formed in a stripe<br>
pattern of 1.5 /zm in width on the p-typenitride semiconductor layer via a mask of a predetermined shape on the n-type nitride semiconductor layer that has been exposed. After forming the protective film, a waveguide (ridge) in a stripe pattern of 1.5<br>
11 m in width is formed by etching to near the interface between the p-type cladding layer and the p-type optical guide layer by RIE as shown in Fig. 1.<br>
(First insulation film)<br>
After forming the ridge, the first insulation.film made of Zr02 is formed on the surface of the p-type nitride semiconductor layer while leaving the Si02 mask to remain<br><br>
thereon. The first insulation film may also be formed over the entire surface of the nitride semiconductor layer'by masking the n-type ohmic electrode . After forming the first insulation film, the device is immersed in buffered hydro'luoric acid so as to dissolve and remove the Si02 from the p-typ'-' 'Contact layer, and Zr02 formed on the p-type contact layer {or ( urther on the n-type contact layer) is removed together with sio2 by lift-off process.

thereof, and the part of the p-type ohmic electrode and the n-type ohmic electrode is exposed by dry etching. (Pad electrode)<br>

After etching, the sapphire is scribed along the mesh pattern where the sapphire is exposed by etching, so as to make laser chips.
