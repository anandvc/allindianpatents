				<td>Background of the Invention <br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to olefin polymerisation. In particular, the present invention<br>
concerns a process and an apparatus for continuous polymerisation olefin monomers like<br>
ethylene and other monomers, wherein an olefin monomer is polymerised in slurry phase in<br>
an inert hydrocarbon diluent in at least one loop reactor.<br>
Description of Related Art<br>
The loop reactor was developed in the 1950's. It is now widely used for the production of<br>
polyethylene and other olefin polymers. In a loop reactor, ethylene is polymerised in the<br>
presence of a hydrocarbon diluent in slurry phase at elevated pressure and temperature. The<br>
slurry is withdrawn from the reactor and concentrated so that the solids content at the reactor<br>
outlet is higher than the solids content in the reactor. Traditionally, this has been done by<br>
using settling legs. However, present methods for concentrating the polymer slurry of a loop<br>
reactor have been unsatisfactory. This is true, in particular, for the production of bimodal<br>
polyethylene in cascaded reactors.<br>
The use of hydrocyclones for concentrating the outlet slurry of a loop reactor is known since<br>
the 1960's. Loop reactors equipped with a hydrocyclone are disclosed in, e.g., US 3 816 383,<br>
where a part of the underflow from the hydrocyclone is taken to product recovery, while the<br>
residual part is combined with the overflow and returned to the loop reactor.<br>
Another document relating to the above-mentioned topic is US 4 395 523, which discloses a<br>
method of making and recovering polymer particles. The known method comprises<br>
polymerising in a loop reactor, directing a portion of the recirculating polymer slurry into a<br>
hydrocyclone, returning the overflow from the hydrocyclone into the reactor and withdrawing<br>
the underflow from the hydrocyclone and conducting it to product recovery.<br><br>
Further, EP 1 118 624, EP 1 118 625 and EP 1 118 626 disclose a process for polymerising<br>
olefins, where the polymer slurry is directed from a loop reactor into a hydrocyclone. The<br>
underflow from the hydrocyclone is directed either to a subsequent polymerisation stage or to<br>
product recovery.	<br>
EP 891 990 discloses an ethylene polymerisation process comprising a continuous take-off of<br>
polymer slurry. The polymer slurry is continuously withdrawn from the loop reactor and fed<br>
to a high-pressure flash. From the high-pressure flash, the polymer is transferred into a low-<br>
pressure flash and from there to product recovery.<br>
Even if the above documents describe different methods of withdrawing the slurry from the<br>
loop reactor, none of them discloses or suggests a polymerization method or apparatus, where<br>
the size of the separation units can be kept small compared to the product flows.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
It is an aim of the present invention to eliminate disadvantages of the prior art and to provide a<br>
novel and economical process for producing olefin, in particular ethylene, homopolymers and<br>
copolymers.<br>
The invention is based on the idea of essentially increasing the concentration of the polymer<br>
slurry before a flash unit so as to reduce the gas flow from the flash to a subsequent flash gas<br>
compressor. The effluent streams of the gas compressor are, as known per se, conducted to a<br>
separation zone, such as a distillation section comprising heavies column(s) and lights<br>
column(s). By means of the invention it is possible significantly to reduce the capacity and<br>
size of the gas compressor and of the subsequent distillation section.<br>
Based on the above, the apparatus according to the invention comprises, in combination and<br>
preferably in a cascade, a loop reactor, means for increasing the concentration of polymer<br>
slurry withdrawn from the loop reactor, a flash unit, a flash gas compressor and a distillation<br>
section for recovering and recycling heavy and light components of the flash gas compressor.<br>
The means for increasing the concentration of the slurry can be located externally to the loop<br>
reactor. Alternatively, they can be arranged in conjunction with the reactor outlet, whereby<br>
the slurry can be concentrated when it is withdrawn from the reactor. The distillation section<br><br>
typically comprises in a cascade at least one heavies column for separating heavy components<br>
from the compressed gas of the flash unit, and at least one lights column for separating light<br>
components from the overhead product of the heavies column.<br>
The process according to the invention for producing olefin polymers in a loop reactor,<br>
wherein at least one olefin monomer is polymerised in slurry phase in a hydrocarbon diluent<br>
or liquid monomer, comprises the following steps:<br>
-	continuously withdrawing polymer slurry from the loop reactor,<br>
-	passing the polymer slurry to a separation device for polymer particles, such as a<br>
hydrocyclone, to provide a concentrated slurry and an overhead stream,<br>
-	recycling the overhead stream to the loop reactor,<br>
-	recycling a first part of the concentrated slurry to the loop reactor,<br>
-	conducting a second part of the concentrated slurry to a high pressure flash unit to<br>
separate the slurry into polymer and overhead gas,<br>
-	recovering the polymer from the flash unit,<br>
-	compressing the overhead gas stream in a flash compressor,<br>
-	passing the compressed flash gas stream into a heavies column in order to separate<br>
oligomers and other heavy components from the gas stream,<br>
-	passing at least a part of the overhead stream from the heavies column into a flash<br>
vessel in order to form a liquid phase and a vapour phase, and<br>
-	directing at least a part of the liquid phase of the flash vessel into a lights column in<br>
order to separate the low-boiling components from the liquid phase.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the invention is applied to. the....<br>
polymerization of ethylene in a loop reactor.<br>
More specifically, the process according to the present invention is mainly characterized by<br>
what is stated in the characterizing part of claim 1.<br>
The apparatus according to the invention is characterized by what is stated in the<br>
characterizing part of claim 16.<br>
The present invention provides important advantages. By means of the invention, an<br>
economical process can be achieved, since the size of the flash gas compressor can be<br><br>
reduced. Without the hydrocyclone the flash gas stream would include, in addition to the flash<br>
gas stream of the present examples, also 50 % of the overhead stream from the hydrocyclone.<br>
Thus, the flash gas stream would be larger. Because the streams are smaller, the size of the<br>
separation units can be reduced. The invention provides for a smaller heavies column, lights<br>
column and comonomer column. Smaller process equipment means smaller investment costs.<br>
Savings in the operation and running costs of the process can also be achieved. The energy<br>
consumption is reduced since recycle gas flows are smaller. This also means a more<br>
economical and environmentally friendly process.<br>
Further details and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following<br>
detailed description comprising a number of working examples.<br><br>
Brief Description of the Accompanying Drawings	<br>
Figure 1 depicts in a schematic fashion the process configuration of a first preferred<br>
embodiment of the invention.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
Overall Process<br>
The reference letters and numerals used in the attached drawing refer to the following pieces<br>
of equipment:<br>
A.	loop reactor	<br>
B.	hydrocyclone <br>
C.	flash tank<br>
D.	diluent compressor<br>
E.	heavies column<br>
F.	lights column<br>
G.	comonomer column<br>
H. flash<br>
and the following flows:<br><br>
1.	feeds<br>
2.	slurry to hydrocyclone<br>
3.	second product stream<br>
4.	first product stream	<br>
5.	overflow from flash<br>
6.	compressed flash gas<br>
7.	gas stream<br>
8.	heavies stream<br>
9.	liquid stream<br><br>
10.	low boiling stream<br>
11.	vapour stream	<br>
12. bottom stream<br><br>
13.	recycle comonomer stream<br>
14.	recycle diluent stream<br>
Thus, as will appear from Figure 1, olefin monomers, like ethylene and optionally one or<br>
more alpha-olefin comonomer(s), are polymerised in a loop reactor A in a hydrocarbon<br>
diluent, preferably propane or isobutane, in the presence of a polymerisation catalyst,<br>
optionally in the presence of hydrogen. The polymer slurry is continuously withdrawn from<br>
the loop reactor A through an outlet nozzle.<br>
At least a part of the polymer slurry thus withdrawn is conducted to a hydrocyclone B, in<br>
which the slurry is concentrated to provide a first product stream 4 having a high<br>
concentration of solid matter and a second product stream 3, which mainly consists of<br>
hydrocarbon diluent separated from the polymer slurry. The first product stream forms the<br>
underflow of the hydrocyclone B and it is conducted to a flash unit C, which preferably is<br>
operated at a high pressure. The overhead flow comprising the second product stream of the<br>
hydrocyclone is recycled from the hydrocyclone B to the loop reactor A.<br>
The product is recovered from the flash tank and conducted for drying, stabilisation and<br>
analysis. The overflow 5 is conducted into a diluent flash compressor. The compressed flash<br>
gas stream 6 is passed into a heavies column in order to separate oligomers and other heavy<br>
components 8 from the gas stream 7. The gas stream 7 from the heavies column is passed into<br>
a flash vessel H in order to form a liquid phase 9 and a vapour phase 11. At least a part of the<br><br>
liquid phase is conducted into a lights column in order to separate the low-boiling components<br>
10 from the liquid phase. The low-boiling components are directed back into the flash vessel<br>
H. At least part of the vapour phase from the flash vessel 11 is directed into the recycle lights<br>
stream to be recycled into the loop reactor.<br>
Optionally, the bottom stream of the lights column 12 is directed into a comonomer column<br>
G. At least part of the overhead stream from the comonomer column 14 is recycled into the<br>
loop reactor A. Optionally, at least part of the bottom stream of the comonomer column 13 is<br>
passed into the the recycle comonomer stream in order to recycle into the loop reactor.<br><br>
Next, the various steps of the process will be examined in more detail.<br>
A. Loop Reactor<br><br>
In the loop reactor 1, olefins like ethylene are homopolymerised or copolymerised with at<br>
least one C4 to C10 alpha-olefin. The polymerisation takes place in an inert hydrocarbon<br>
diluent or liquid monomer, preferably a C3 to C5 hydrocarbon diluent, more preferably in<br>
propane or isobutane diluent, and in particular propane diluent.<br>
The temperature in the loop is from about 60 °C to about 110 °C, preferably from 75 to 105<br>
°C. If ethylene or propylene is homopolymerised in the loop reactor, it is preferred to operate<br>
the loop reactor at conditions known as "supercritical", where the operating temperature<br>
exceeds the critical temperature of the reaction mixture and the operating pressure exceeds the<br>
critical pressure of the reaction mixture. At such conditions, the operation temperature is<br>
higher than 90 °C, preferably higher than 93 °C.<br>
The operating pressure needs to be selected so that the contents of the loop reactor remain<br>
either in liquid state or supercritical state. For liquid slurry operation, the suitable range of<br>
operating pressure is from about 20 to about 100 bar, preferably from 25 to 75 bar. For<br>
supercritical slurry operation, the suitable range of operating pressure is from about 50 to<br>
about 100 bar, preferably from 55 to 80 bar.<br><br>
Suitable catalysts that can be used to polymerise ethylene are, e.g., Ziegler-Natta catalysts,<br>
single-site catalysts, multi-site catalysts containing one or more single-site catalyst<br>
components, or combinations or mixtures of these.<br>
The Ziegler-Natta catalyst comprises titanium and magnesium compounds, optionally also<br>
aluminium compounds, and may be supported on an inert support, such as silica or<br>
magnesium dichloride. Preferable catalysts are those that are disclosed in EP 688 794, EP 949<br>
274, WO 99/58584 and WO 01/55230.<br>
The single-site catalyst may be any catalyst that comprises one or more substituted or<br>
unsubstituted cyclopentadienyl ligands. Particularly useful are catalysts disclosed in WO<br>
97/28170 and WO 00/34341.<br>
Preferably, ethylene is (co)polymerised in the loop reactor in the presence of hydrogen to<br>
produce the low molecular weight polymer component. Typically, the reaction mixture<br>
contains from 0 to 10 %, preferably from 0 to 4 mol-% of alpha-olefin comonomer. If a<br>
Ziegler-Natta catalyst is used, the reaction mixture typically contains from 2 to 10 mol-%<br>
hydrogen, preferably from 2 to 8 mol-%. If a single site catalyst is used, the reaction mixture<br>
typically contains from 0.01 to 1 mol-% hydrogen. Further, the reaction mixture contains<br>
typically from 1 to 10 mol-%, preferably from 3 to 10 mol-% ethylene. If a single site catalyst<br>
is used, then slightly lower ethylene concentration may be used. The reaction mixture further<br>
comprises the components of the diluent. Preferably, the major part of the diluent is propane,<br>
with minor quantities of other alkanes, such as methane, ethane, and butanes.<br>
The concentration of the polymer in the reactor slurry is typically from 10 to 40 % by volume,<br>
preferably from 20 to 30 % by volume.<br>
The polymer slurry is withdrawn from the loop reactor continuously through an outlet. The<br>
outlet may be placed at any suitable location in the reactor. However, most preferably the<br>
outlet is located at a suitable location downstream of the loop circulation pump. It is also<br>
possible to withdraw the slurry from the loop reactor in such a manner that the concentration<br>
of solids at the outlet is higher than the concentration of solids in the loop reactor. The slurry<br>
may be directed into the flash unit directly or through a further concentration step.<br><br>
Pressure of the reactor is controlled by continuous withdrawal of the slurry from the reactor<br>
through an outlet nozzle. The said slurry can be directed to the hydrocyclone. In that case the<br>
pressure control valve is located in the product take off line of the hydrocyclone.<br>
Performance of the hydrocyclone is highly dependent on the feed conditions. Any disturbance<br>
in the bottom flow will affect the performance of the hydrocyclone. The design can be made<br>
e.g. by allowing a wide controlling range for the feed flow. Stable operating conditions could<br>
then be reached by recycling a part of the slurry from the bottom of the hydrocyclone to the<br>
reactor.<br>
The cut size of the particles can be adjusted e.g. by controlling the feed flow to the<br>
hydrocyclone.<br>
Solids concentration at the bottom of the hydrocyclone can be measured and adjusted by<br>
adjusting the ratio of the recycle flow (overflow) and the product flow (underflow).<br>
B. Hydrocyclone<br>
From the loop reactor A the polymer slurry is directed to a hydrocyclone B, where the<br>
concentration of the slurry takes place by effect of centrifugal forces. The hydrocyclone<br>
divides the slurry flow into two streams: An overflow 3, which is rich in liquid, and an<br>
underflow 4, which is rich in polymer. The overflow is returned to the loop reactor or to a<br>
fines collection tank (not shown in the drawing) and the underflow is directed to a flash unit.<br>
A part of the underflow may be recycled back to the loop reactor<br>
As described above, the slurry entering the hydrocyclone has a solids content of 10 to 40 %<br>
by volume. The solids concentration in the underflow can be adjusted by adjusting the ratio of<br>
the recycle flow (overflow) to the product flow (underflow), and is typically from 30 to 55 %<br>
by volume, preferably 40 to 52 % by volume. Thus, solids concentration is typically increased<br>
by at least 20 %, preferably at least 50 %, in particular at least 100 %. It is often advantageous<br>
to recycle a part of the underflow back to the loop reactor.<br>
The maximum solids concentration in the product flow is set by the limit of stable operation.<br>
If the solids concentration of the slurry is too high, the risk of plugging the product flow<br><br>
increases. For economical reasons, on the other hand, as high as possible solids concentration<br>
in the slurry is desired.	<br>
Typically, the ratio of recycle flow to product flow is from about 0.01 to about 10, preferably<br>
from 0.01 to 5 and more preferably from 0.1 to 2.<br>
The ratio of the product withdrawal stream and the product recycle stream can be changed<br>
freely so that stable operation of both the hydrocyclone and the reactor is obtained. The<br>
amount of product returned back to the reactor can be 0-90 %.<br>
The solids concentration of the recycle flow is typically about 0 (or at least 0.001) to 5 % by<br>
volume.<br>
C. Flash Unit<br>
The flash unit C typically consists of a heated flash pipe and a receiving vessel. The slurry<br>
entering the flash unit has a solids concentration of 30 to 60 % by volume. In the flash unit,<br>
the remaining hydrocarbons are removed from the polymer. The flash pipe is preferably<br>
heated, e.g. by steam or water. If water is used for heating, the heating water can be<br>
advantageously taken from the jacket of the loop reactor. The temperature is selected<br>
according to the composition of the hydrocarbon fluid so that the fluid is essentially<br>
evaporated. The phrase "essentially removing the fluid phase" means that a major fraction of<br>
the fluid phase is removed and only an amount of fluid that fills the volume between the<br>
polymer particles and the volume of pores in the polymer particles remains with the polymer.<br>
Typically, the temperature at the receiving vessel is from 50 to 100 °C, preferably from 60 to<br>
90 °C, in particular from 70 to 90 °C, and a pressure of 10 to 30 bar, preferably 12 to 27 bar,<br>
and in particular from 14 to 24 bar.<br>
The flash unit can also be operated as a low pressure flash. This means operation at a lower<br>
pressure, closer of even at ambient pressure. Pressures below 10 bar and preferably below 5<br>
bar are suitable for low pressure flash.<br>
At least a part of the overhead flow 5 from the receiving vessel of the flash unit is directed to<br>
a diluent compressor D in order to compress the stream.<br><br>
D.	Heavies Column<br>
The compressed flash gas stream 6 is passed into a heavies column in order to separate<br>
oligomers and other heavy components 8 from the gas stream 7. The gas stream 7 from the<br>
heavies column is passed into a flash vessel H in order to form a liquid phase 9 and a vapour<br>
phase 11.<br>
E.	Lights Column<br>
At least a part of the liquid phase 9 is conducted into a lights column in order to separate the<br>
low-boiling components 10 from the liquid phase. The low-boiling components are directed<br>
back into the flash vessel H. At least part of the vapour phase from the flash vessel 11 is<br>
directed into the recycle lights stream to be recycled into the loop reactor.<br>
F.	Comonomer Column (optional)<br>
Optionally, the bottom stream of the lights column 12 is directed into a comonomer column<br>
G.	At least part of the overhead stream from the comonomer column 14 is recycled into the<br>
loop reactor A. Optionally, at least part of the bottom stream of the comonomer column 13 is<br>
passed into the the recycle comonomer stream in order to recycle into the loop reactor.<br>
A slurry reactor operated according to the present invention can be included in a multistage<br>
polymerisation sequence comprising one or several slurry reactor(s), which form a cascade<br>
with one or several gas phase polymerisation reactor(s), as disclosed in our copending patent<br>
application EP 02396161.8, the content of which is herewith incorporated by reference.<br>
In the present context it is briefly noted that the gas phase reactors can be operated at a<br>
temperature of from about 60 °C to about 115 °C, preferably 70 to 110 °C. The operating<br>
pressure is from 10 to 30 bar, preferably from 15 to 25 bar. In the gas phase reactor, olefins<br>
are is copolymerised with one or more C2 to C10 alpha-olefin comonomers, or the olefins like<br>
ethylene are homopolymerised. Preferably, the olefins like ethylene are copolymerised in the<br>
gas phase reactor with a minor amount of hydrogen to produce a high molecular weight<br>
polyethylene copolymer. The reaction mixture contains typically from 5 to 25 mol-%<br>
ethylene, from 0.1 to 10 mol-% alpha-olefin comonomers and from 0.01 to 3 mol-%<br>
hydrogen. If a single site catalyst is used for ethylene polymerization, then the content of<br><br>
hydrogen may be from 0.001 to 1 mol-%. The remainder is composed of inert components,<br>
like nitrogen or propane.<br>
The following non-limiting examples illustrate the invention:<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1:<br>
A 10 m3 loop reactor is operated at 95 °C and 60 bar pressure with propane diluent. Ethylene<br>
homopolymer is produced in the reactor by introducing ethylene, diluent, hydrogen and a<br>
polymerisation catalyst, which was prepared according to Example 3 of EP 688794 with the<br>
exception that as a carrier material silica having an average particle size of 20 urn is used, in<br>
such quantities that the diluent contains 5.9 mol-% of ethylene and 2.6 mol-% hydrogen. The<br>
remainder is propane with minor quantities (less than 1 mol-% each) of methane, ethane,<br>
isobutane and n-butane. The polymer production is 1.4 tons per hour; the melt index of the<br>
polymer is 450 g/10 min and the density 973 kg/m3 The solids content of the slurry is 25 vol-<br>
%.<br>
The polymer slurry is withdrawn continuously from the reactor through an outlet nozzle and<br>
transferred to a hydrocyclone according to Figure 1. The total slurry feed to the hydrocyclone<br>
is 5.5 tons per hour. The product flow is 3.7 tons per hour, with 52 vol-% of solids. The<br>
recycle flow is 1.8 tons per hour, with 1.7 vol-% solids. The recycle flow is returned to the<br>
loop reactor. The product flow is divided into two streams: The product withdrawal stream is<br>
about 1.8 tons per hour and the product recycle stream about 1.9 tons per hour. The product<br>
withdrawal stream is directed to hydrocarbon removal stage and the product recycle stream is<br>
returned into the loop reactor.<br>
The product withdrawal stream of the hydrocyclone is routed via a heated pipe into a flash<br>
tank, operated at a temperature of 70 °C and a pressure of 20 bar. The hydrocarbons separated<br>
from the polymer are returned into the loop reactor via a diluent recovery at a rate of 0.3 tons<br>
per hour. They contain 5.9 mol-% of ethylene and 2.6 mol-% of hydrogen.<br>
The polymer is directed to the product recovery for drying, stabilisation and analysis.<br><br>
This example illustrates how economical the present process is: without a hydrocyclone, the<br>
flash gas stream would include in addition to the flash gas stream of the example also about<br>
50 % of the overhead stream from the hydrocyclone. Thus, the flash gas stream would be<br>
0.5*1.8 t/h +0.3 t/h= 1.2 t/h.<br>
Example 2:<br>
Into the reactor of Example 1 is introduced ethylene, 1-butene, hydrogen and diluent, as well<br>
as similar catalyst to what was used in Example 1, so that the reaction mixture contains 6.8<br>
mol-% ethylene, 3.1 mol-% 1-butene and 1.8 mol-% hydrogen. Polymerisation temperature is<br>
85 °C. The polymer production is 1.2 tons per hour, the melt index of the polymer is 200 g/10<br>
min and the density 950 kg/m3. The solids content of the slurry is 25 vol-%.<br>
 The polymer slurry is withdrawn continuously from the reactor through an outlet nozzle and<br>
transferred to a hydrocyclone according to Figure 1. The total, slurry feed to the hydrocyclone<br>
is 5.2 tons per hour. The product flow is 3.8 tons per hour, with 39 vol-% of solids. The<br>
recycle flow is 1.4 tons per hour, with 5.8 vol-% solids. The recycle flow is returned to the<br>
loop reactor. The product flow is divided into two streams: The product withdrawal stream is<br>
about 1.9 tons per hour and the product recycle stream about 1.8 tons per hour. The product<br>
withdrawal stream is directed to hydrocarbon removal stage and the product recycle stream is<br>
returned into the loop reactor.<br>
The product withdrawal stream of the hydrocyclone is passed through a heated pipe into a<br>
flash tank, operated at a temperature of 70 °C and a pressure of 20 bar. The hydrocarbons<br>
separated from the polymer are returned into the loop reactor via a diluent recovery at a rate<br>
of 0.6 tons per hour. They contain 6.8 mol-% of ethylene, 3.1 mol-% of 1-butene and 1.8 mol-<br>
% of hydrogen.<br>
The polymer is directed to the product recovery for drying, stabilisation and analysis.<br><br>
