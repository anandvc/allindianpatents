OPHTHALMIC EMULSIONS CONTAINING PROSTAGLANDINS<br>
The present invention concerns ophthalmic cationic oil-<br>
in-water type emulsions containing prostaglandins.<br>
In the present invention, the term « prostaglandin » is<br>
indifferently used for prostaglandin, its precursors or<br>
analogs.<br>
The present invention is of particular interest for<br>
prostaglandin F2c analogs such as in particular latanoprost,<br>
unoprostone isopropyl, travoprost, bimatoprost, tafluprost,<br>
8-isoprostaglandin E2 or a mixture of two or more thereof.<br>
By « ophthalmic it is meant an emulsion intended to be<br>
administered to the eye and which presents a pharmaceutical<br>
effect; preferably, it is topically applied.<br>
It is known to use prostaglandins in ophthalmic<br>
preparations in order to treat glaucoma. The problem<br>
encountered with prostaglandins, in particular with<br>
latanoprost, is that their concentration lowers in the<br>
formulation overtime.<br>
US6,011,062, US5,688,819, US5,849,792, US4,599,353<br>
describe the use of several prostaglandin analogs for<br>
treating glaucoma and ocular hypertension. US5,849,792<br>
discloses the use of a non ionic surfactant (polyethoxylated<br>
castor oil) to enhance the prostaglandin's chemical<br>
stability.<br>
However, the proposed solutions to enhance the stability<br>
of prostaglandins are not completely satisfactory.<br>
Furthermore, use of BAK or other quaternary ammonium as<br>
preservative agent for prostaglandins in ophthalmic<br>
preparations has been challenged, since C. Debbasch et al. in<br>
Investigative Ophthalmology &amp; Visual Science, March 2001,<br>
Vol42 n°3, demonstrated important toxicity of long term use<br>
of BAK and/or other quaternary ammoniums.<br><br>
WO 2007/042262	PCT/EP2006/009783<br>
- 2 -<br>
Latanoprost, Travoprost, Bimatoprost, unoprostone<br>
isopropyl, tafluprost, 8-isoprostaglandinE2, like most of the<br>
prostaglandin analogs, are almost insoluble in water. So, it<br>
is interesting to provide ophthalmic vehicles suitable for<br>
delivering hydrophobic drugs. In recent years, oil-in-water<br>
type emulsions, in particular emulsions having droplets of a<br>
submicron size (hereinafter "submicron emulsions") gained<br>
increasing importance. These emulsions are in general anionic<br>
emulsions. The major hurdle in developing topically applied<br>
ophthalmic drug delivery systems such as emulsions is the<br>
relatively low bioavailability of the drugs. To address this<br>
issue, cationic emulsions have been developed as topical<br>
ophthalmic vehicles; they have the advantage of increasing<br>
the bioavailability of the drugs by electrostatic attraction<br>
between the emulsions's positive charge and the negatives<br>
charges carried at the eye surface. However, stabilizing<br>
emulsions, including submicron emulsions, may be a concern<br>
for one skilled in the art. One known approach to stabilize<br>
an emulsion is to confer an electrostatic charge to the<br>
droplets surface which will result in droplet repulsion and<br>
less droplet coalescence. Colloidal particles dispersed in a<br>
solution are electrically charged due to their ionic<br>
characteristics and dipole attributes. This charge, which can<br>
be negative resulting in anionic emulsions or positive<br>
producing cationic emulsions (Klang et al., Pharm. Dev.<br>
Technology 2000, 5, 521-532) is known in the art as the "zeta<br>
potential". The zeta potential is a measure of the magnitude<br>
of the repulsion or attraction between particles (Washington,<br>
Adv. Drug Deliv. Reviews 1996, 20:131-145).<br>
Of particular interest are the following patents dealing<br>
with cationic emulsions for topical ocular administration:<br>
US Patent 6,007,826 discloses a cationic oil-in-water<br>
emulsion which comprises colloid particles with a positively<br><br>
WO 2007/042262	PCT/EP2006/009783<br>
- 3 -<br>
charged interfacial film. The interfacial film is formed by<br>
cationic lipids (0.05-3% by weight) such as Cio-Cu primary<br>
alkylamines (disclosed are stearylamine or oleylamine), Ci0-<br>
C24 primary alkanolamine or a cholesterol betainate;<br>
phospholipids (0.5-3%) and non-ionic surfactants from the<br>
group consisting of poloxamers, tyloxapol, polysorbate, and<br>
polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters (0.05-3%). The<br>
concentration of the oily core is maintained within the 3-20%<br>
range.<br>
US Patent 6,007,826 emulsions zeta potential are not<br>
stable to thermal stress (see Tamilvanan et al., STP Pharma<br>
Sciences 2001, 11:421-426 and Example 12).<br>
Thus, there is still a need in ophthalmic prostaglandin<br>
products which are at least as efficient as the commercial<br>
products, which present an enhanced chemical stability of the<br>
prostaglandin, which are less toxic, which are more<br>
physically and chemically stable than conventional products,<br>
i.e. which are stable overtime and which present a good<br>
tolerability for the patient.<br>
By overtime in the meaning of this invention, it is<br>
meant a duration exceeding 1 year, preferably exceeding 2<br>
years, more preferably exceeding 3 years.<br>
By "good tolerability" in the present the invention, it<br>
is understood that the ratio therapeutic benefit to ocular<br>
discomfort is acceptable by the patient, and preferably<br>
similar to a placebo or NaCl 0.9% solution.<br>
It is generally accepted that in order to show good ocular<br>
tolerability the cation content within the formulation should<br>
not exceed 0.1%, preferably not exceed 0.05% and even more<br>
preferably should not exceed 0.03%.. Quaternary amines such<br>
as benzalkonium chloride, benzododecinium bromide and<br>
benzethonium chloride are allowed by health authorities for<br>
ophthalmic administration up to concentration of<br><br>
WO 2007/042262	PCT/EP2006/009783<br>
- A -<br>
approximately 0.03% (Furrer et al., Eur. J. Pharm. Biopharm.<br>
2002, 53:263-280).<br>
This invention thus relates to a cationic ophthalmic oil-<br>
in-water type emulsion, which comprises colloid particles<br>
having an oily core surrounded by an interfacial film,<br>
said emulsion comprising at least one cationic agent and<br>
at least one non ionic surfactant selected from selected from<br>
the group consisting of poloxamers, tyloxapol, polysorbates,<br>
polyoxyethylene castor oil derivatives, sorbitan esters,<br>
polyoxyl stearates and a mixture of two or more thereof, said<br>
oily core comprising a drug selected from the group<br>
consisting of latanoprost, unoprostone isopropyl, travoprost,<br>
bimatoprost, tafluprost, 8-isoprostaglandin E2 or a mixture<br>
of two or more thereof, and said emulsion being free of<br>
water-soluble polymer selected from a polyvinyl compound, a<br>
water-soluble cellulose compound and a polysaccharide.<br>
In a prefered embodiment the emulsions of the invention<br>
includes latanoprost, as only drug or in combination with one<br>
or more prostaglandin selected from the group consisting of<br>
unoprostone isopropyl, travoprost, bimatoprost, tafluprost<br>
and 8-isoprostaglandin E2.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the emulsion of the<br>
invention is free of water-soluble polymer selected from (1)<br>
a polyvinyl compound such as polyvinylalcohol and<br>
polyvinylpyrrrolidone, (2) a water-soluble cellulose compound<br>
such as methylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose,<br>
hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, and/or sodium cellulose and (3)<br>
a polysaccharide selected from alginic acid, xanthan gum,<br>
carrageenan, and chitosan.<br>
According to an embodiment, the emulsion includes<br>
polyoxyethylene castor oil derivatives, especially<br>
polyethoxylated castor oil such as for example PEG PEG-30<br>
PEG-35 PEG-50 castor oils.<br><br>
WO 2007/042262	PCT/EP2006/009783<br>
- 5 -<br>
According to another embodiment, the emulsion is free of<br>
any polyoxyethylene castor oil derivatives.<br>
The term "free of" in combination with a compound or a<br>
list of compound, means that the emulsion does not contain<br>
any compound of that kind.<br>
According to a specific embodiment of the invention, the<br>
emulsion may further comprise an anti-inflammatory compound,<br>
preferably a non steroidal anti-inflammatory compound or a<br>
omega-3 fatty acid. Anti-inflammatory agents may be chosen in<br>
the group comprising COX-2 inhibitors, salicylates, 2-<br>
arylpropionic acids, N-arylanthranilic acids, oxicams,<br>
sulphonanilides, pyrazolidines derivatives, arylalkanoic<br>
acids, 3-benzolphenylacetic acids and derivatives; steroids<br>
such as cortisone, hydrocortisone, prednisone, prednisolone,<br>
methylprednisone, fluoromethalone, medrysone, betamethasone,<br>
loteprednol, flumethasone, mometasone, testosterone,<br>
methyltestosterone, danazol, beclomethasone, dexamethasone,<br>
dexamethasone palmitate, tramcinolone, triamcinolone<br>
acetonide, fluocinolone, fluocinolone acetonide,<br>
difluprednate, rimexolone.<br>
In the emulsions of this invention, the chemical<br>
stability of prostaglandins is enhanced. Without being linked<br>
by any theory, it is believed that since the prostaglandin is<br>
solubilized in the oily core of the emulsion, it is less<br>
available to contact with agents enhancing its degradation.<br>
Said stability is defined as the extent to which a product<br>
retains, within specified limits and throughout its period of<br>
storage and use (i.e., its shelf life), the same properties<br>
and characteristics that it possessed at the time of<br>
manufacture. The purpose of stability testing is to provide<br>
evidence on how the quality of a drug substance or drug<br>
product varies overtime under the influence of a variety of<br><br>
WO 2007/042262	PCT/EP2006/009783<br>
- 6 -<br>
environmental factors such as temperature, humidity and<br>
light, and enables recommended storage conditions, re-test<br>
periods and shelf lives to be established.<br>
Although real-time stability studies include an<br>
evaluation of those factors that ultimately affect the<br>
expiration date of the drugs, they are time and cost-<br>
consuming. Conventionally, accelerated stability studies are<br>
used for predicting the shelf life of pharmaceutical<br>
products. Such accelerated studies subject the systems to a<br>
temperature of 40°C during 6 months.<br>
In order to understand the intrinsic stability mechanism<br>
of the molecule by establishing degradation pathways and<br>
identifying the likely degradation products, and thus to<br>
adjust the analytical procedures to be used, the Applicant<br>
has developed stress stability testing during which the<br>
emulsions are subjected to extreme conditions that is a<br>
temperature of 80°C during specified period of time.<br>
The amount of prostaglandins present in the oily core of the<br>
emulsion according to the invention depends on the nature of<br>
the prostaglandins and to the intended use. According to an<br>
embodiment, the amount of the drug(s) selected from the group<br>

WO 2007/042262	PCT/EP2006/009783<br>
- 11 -<br>
overtime must be such that at any time, the amount of<br>
positive charge is above the amount of negative charges.<br>
Zeta potential<br>
Zeta potential measures a physical property which is<br>
exhibited by any particle in suspension. Zeta potential can<br>
be used to predict behaviour of the suspension in different<br>
environments, to optimize the formulations of suspensions and<br>
emulsions as well as to predict overtime stability.<br>
In order to avoid the emulsion droplets to adhere to one<br>
another and form aggregates of successively increasing size,<br>
it is necessary to confer repulsive forces to the particles.<br>
One of the means to confer repulsive forces to a colloidal<br>
system is by electrostatic or charge stabilization.<br>
Electrostatic or charge stabilization has the benefits of<br>
stabilizing a system by simply altering the concentration of<br>
ions in the system. This is a reversible and inexpensive<br>
process.<br>
There might by many origins of this surface charge<br>
depending upon the nature of the particle and its surrounding<br>
medium but the most important mechanisms are the ionisation<br>
of surface groups or the adsorption of charged ions.<br>
The interaction of particles in polar liquids is not<br>
governed by the electrical potential at the surface of the<br>
particle, but by the effective potential of the particle and<br>
its associated ions. To utilize electrostatic control of<br>
dispersions, it is the zeta potential of the particle that<br>
must be measured rather than its surface charge. Charged<br>
particles will attract ions of opposite charge in the<br>
dispersant. Ions close to the surface are strongly bound;<br>
those further away form a more diffuse region. Within this<br>
region is a notional boundary, known as the slipping plane,<br>
within which the particle and ions act as a single entity.<br><br>
WO 2007/042262	PCT/EP2006/009783<br>

The potential at the slipping plane is known as the zeta<br>
potential. It has long been recognised that the zeta<br>
potential is a very good index of the magnitude of the<br>
interaction between colloidal particles and measurements of<br>
zeta potential are commonly used to assess the stability of<br>
colloidal systems. The zeta potential measured in a<br>
particular system is dependent on the chemistry of the<br>
surface, and also of the way it interacts with its<br>
surrounding environment. Therefore zeta potential must always<br>
be studied in a well defined environment (specifically pH and<br>
ionic strength).<br>
Electrophoretic mobility<br>
An important conseguence of the existence of electrical<br>
charges on the surface of particles is that they interact<br>
with an applied electric field. These effects are<br>
collectively defined as electrokinetic effects. If the motion<br>
is induced in a particle suspended in a liquid under the<br>
influence of an applied electric field, it is more<br>
specifically named electrophoresis. When an electric field is<br>
applied across an electrolyte, charged particles suspended in<br>
the electrolyte are attracted towards the electrode of<br>
opposite charge. Viscous forces acting on the particles tend<br>
to oppose this movement. When equilibrium is reached between<br>
these two opposing forces, the particles move with constant<br>
velocity. The velocity is dependent on the strength of<br>
electric field or voltage gradient, the dielectric constant<br>
of the medium, the viscosity of the medium and the zeta<br>
potential. The velocity of a particle in a unit electric<br>
field is referred to as its electrophoretic mobility. Zeta<br>
potential is related to the electrophoretic mobility by the<br>
Henry equation:<br><br>
WO 2007/042262	PCT/EP2006/009783<br>
- 13 -<br><br>
where UE = electrophoretic mobility, z= zeta potential,<br>
e = dielectric constant, r|= viscosity and f (xa) =Henry' s<br>
function.<br>
Electrophoretic determinations of zeta potential are<br>
most commonly made in aqueous media and moderate electrolyte<br>
concentration. f(Ka) in this case is 1.5, and this is<br>
referred to as the Smoluchowski approximation. Therefore<br>
calculation of zeta potential from the mobility is<br>
straightforward for systems that fit the Smoluchowski model,<br>
i.e. particles larger than about 0.2 microns dispersed in<br>
electrolytes containing more that 10-3 molar salt. For small<br>
particles in low dielectric constant media (eg non-aqueous<br>
media), f(Ka) becomes 1.0 and allows an equally simple<br>
calculation. This is referred to as the Huckel approximation.<br>
Tests A, B, C and D<br>
Test A consists in measuring the stability of the<br>
emulsion zeta potential under thermal stress conditions.<br>
Zeta potential of the emulsion is measured at T=0, i.e.<br>
as soon as the emulsion has been prepared, the obtained value<br>
being named Zo. Glass vials (Type I) of 10ml effective<br>
capacity containing between 5-10ml of emulsion and sealed<br>
under nitrogen atmosphere (without bubbling) are stored at<br>
80°C.<br>
Then at T=15 hours the zeta potential Zi5h is measured.<br>
The value SA = Zi5h-Z0 is then calculated.<br>
For each measurement of the zeta potential, it is<br>
operated as follows:<br>
The zeta potential of the emulsion droplet surface is<br>
determined by electrophoretic mobility in an apparatus such<br><br>
WO 2007/042262	PCT/EP2006/009783<br>
- 14 -<br>
as a Malvern Zetasizer 2000 (Malvern Instruments, UK)<br>
equipped with suitable software and calibrated with the<br>
supplied standard.<br>
The emulsion is diluted in double distilled water if<br>
needed in order to obtain the scattering intensity allowing<br>
optimal particle detection. The sample count rate should be<br>
between 100 to 1000 KCps, in homodyne detection (if<br>
heterodyne detection is used, the contribution of the<br>
reference beam should be deduced). Three consecutive<br>
measurements are performed at 25°C using a constant cell<br>
drive of 150mV. The electrophoretic mobility is converted<br>
into zeta potential values through the Smoluchowsky equation,<br>
using the dielectric constants and viscosity of water. The<br>
measured value corresponds to the average of the 3 obtained<br>
values.<br>
It is considered that the emulsion meets zeta potential<br>
stability Test A if 5A is less than the standard error of<br>
measurements, preferably less than lOmV, and even more<br>
preferably less than 5mV.<br>
According to an advantageous embodiment, the ophthalmic<br>
emulsion according to the invention meets zeta potential<br>
stability Test B.<br>
Test B is similar to Test A except that the emulsion is<br>
stored during 48 hours at 80°C, the zeta potential Z2 is<br>
measured on day 2 and 5B = Z2 -Zo is calculated. The emulsion<br>
is considered as meeting the requirements of zeta potential<br>
stability test B if 5B is less than the standard error of<br>
measurements, preferably less than lOmV, and even more<br>
preferably less than 5mV.<br>
According to a more advantageous embodiment of the<br>
invention, the ophthalmic emulsion according to the invention<br>
meets zeta potential stability Test C.<br><br>
WO 2007/042262	PCT/EP2006/009783<br>
- 15 -<br>
Test C is similar to Test A except that the emulsion is<br>
stored during 7 days at 80°C, the zeta potential Z7 is<br>
measured on day 7 and 8C = Z7 -Zo is calculated. The emulsion<br>
is considered as meeting the requirements of zeta potential<br>
stability test C if 5C is less than the standard error of<br>
measurements, preferably less than lOmV, and even more<br>
preferably less than 5mV.<br>
According to a still more advantageous embodiment of the<br>
invention, the ophthalmic emulsion according to the invention<br>
meets zeta potential stability Test D.<br>
Test D is similar to Test A except that the emulsion is<br>
stored during 14 days at 80°C, the zeta potential Z14 is<br>
measured on day 14 and 8D = zi4 -z0 is calculated. The<br>
emulsion is considered as meeting the requirements of zeta<br>
potential stability test D if 5D is less than the standard<br>
error of measurements, preferably less than lOmV, and even<br>
more preferably less than 5mV.<br>

phase components were successively weighed in the same beaker<br>
and then magnetically stirred under a slight heating (40°C)<br>
until a transparent, limpid and fluid phase is obtained. Both<br>
phases were heated to 65°C. The coarse emulsion was formed by<br>
rapid addition of the aqueous phase in the oily phase and was<br>
then rapidly heated to 75°C. The aqueous phase and coarse<br>
emulsion beakers were protected by a film to avoid any water<br>
evaporation. The emulsion was white and slightly transparent.<br>
The emulsion droplet size was then decreased by a 5 minutes<br>
high shear mixing with a POLYTRON PT 6100. The emulsion<br>
became milky. The emulsion temperature was cooled down to<br>
20°C using an ice bath.<br>
The final emulsion was obtained by homogenization in a<br>
microfluidizer (C5, Avestin) using continuous cycles for 5<br>
min at a pressure of 10,000 psi. The emulsion was milky, very<br>
fluid and did not adhere on the glass. The emulsion<br>
temperature was decreased to 25°C. Its pH was measured and<br>
then adjusted to 7.0 using a 0.1 M HC1 or 0.1 M NaOH<br>
solution. Emulsion was conditioned in glass vials with<br>
nitrogen bubbling and then sterilized in an autoclave 20<br>
minutes at 121°C.<br>
The mean particle size of the emulsions droplets was<br>
determined by quasi-elastic light scattering after dilution<br>
in water using a High Performance Particle Sizer (Malvern<br>
Instruments, UK).<br>
The electrophoretic mobility was measured at 25°C in a<br>
Malvern Zetasizer 2000 (Malvern Instruments, UK) following a<br>
1:200 dilution in double distilled water as detailed above<br>
and converted into zeta potential through the Smoluchowski<br>

Latanoprost stability improvement in emulsion compared to<br>
commercial product (Xalatan®)<br>
The chemical stability of latanoprost within the emulsion was<br>
compared to the commercial product Xalatan® at 80°C for 14<br>
days (figure 1).<br>
Prostaglandin contents were analysed by an HPLC-UV method.<br>
In emulsions according to the invention, latanoprost is<br>
chemically stabilized.<br>

this study. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured at 0 hr<br>
(before drug administration) and then hourly until 6 hrs<br>
after drug administration for one baseline day, one vehicle -<br>
treated day, and treatment days 1,3, and 5 with 30/zl of<br>
Z29EM007 (similar to the emulsion described in Example 1) or<br>
0.005% Latanoprost (Xalatan; Pharmarcia &amp; Upjohn, Kalamazoo,<br>
MI) .<br>
The products were topically applied to the glaucomatous eye<br>
once daily for 5 consecutive days in a crossover design with<br>
a washout period at least 2 weeks between the two drugs.<br>
Results: Once daily administration of both Z2 9EM007 and<br>
Xalatan for 5 days significantly (p
hr to 5 hrs after the first dose compared to the vehicle<br>
treatment day (figure 2).<br>
The ocular hypotensive effect was enhanced by repeated dosing<br>
for both Z29EM007 and Xalatan. No statistical difference of<br>
IOP reduction (p&gt; 0.80) was observed during the 5 days<br>
treatment when comparing Z2 9EM007 and Xalatan. IOP on the<br>
baseline day and vehicle-treated day was not statistically<br>
different between the two drugs (p&gt;0.90).<br>
Latanoprost in the emulsions according to the invention is as<br>
efficient as commercially available Xalatan™'<br>
