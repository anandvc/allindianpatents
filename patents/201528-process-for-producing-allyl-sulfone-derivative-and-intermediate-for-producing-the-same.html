Examples<br>
The following examples further illustrate the present invention in detail but the present invention are not limited by these examples. Example 1<br><br>
Alcohol (I) (1.0 g (2.68 mmole) ) was dissolved in dimethoxyethane (hereinafter abbreviated as DME) (30 ml) at room temperature and 1 M TiCl4 solution (9.5 ml) in toluene was added dropwise thereto at the same temperature. After addition, the temperature of the reaction mixture was raised to 60°C, followed by stirring for 30 hours. After completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture was poured into water and the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer thus obtained was washed in sequence with an aqueous saturated sodium bicarbonate solution and saturated saline and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and the solvent was distilled off. The resultant yellow oily material was purified by silica gel chromatography to obtain allyl halide (II) in a yield of 55%.<br>

After stirring at the same temperature for 2 hours, the temperature of the reaction mixture was raised to room temperature, followed by stirring at the same temperature for 6.5 hours. After completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture was poured into water, and the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate. The resultant organic layer was washed in sequence with an aqueous saturated sodium bicarbonate solution and saturated saline and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and the solvent was distilled off to obtain a yellow oily crude product. When the crude product thus obtained was quantified by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) , the yield of allyl halide (II) was 97% (trans/cis=84/16). Example 3<br><br><br>
Alcohol (I) (trans/cis=96/4; 188 mg (0.5 mmole) ) was dissolved in toluene (2.8 ml) at room temperature and acetone (395 mg (6.8 mmole)) was added dropwise thereto. Then, the mixture was cooled to 0°C and 1 M TiCl4 solution (1.2 ml) in toluene was added dropwise thereto at the same temperature. After addition, the mixture was stirred at the same temperature for 1 hour. After completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture was poured into water, followed by extraction with ethyl acetate. The resultant organic layer was washed in sequence with an aqueous saturated sodium bicarbonate solution and saturated saline and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and the solvent was distilled off to obtain a yellow oily crude product. When the crude product thus obtained was quantified by HPLC, the yield of allyl halide (II) was 91% (trans/cis=91/9).<br><br>
Phosphorus trichloride (137 mg (1.0 mmole)) was added dropwise to N,N-dimethylformamide (0.5 ml) at room temperature and the mixture was allowed to stand at the<br><br>
same temperature for 2.5 hours. Then, alcohol (I) (trans/cis=99/l; 377 mg (1.0 mmole)) was added thereto at the same temperature, followed by stirring for 1.5 hours. After completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture was poured into water and the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate. The resultant organic layer was washed in sequence with an aqueous saturated sodium bicarbonate solution and saturated saline and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and the solvent was distilled off to obtain a yellow oily crude product. When the crude product thus obtained was quantified by HPLC, the yield of allyl halide (II) was 99% (tans/cis=97/3). Example 5<br><br>
Alcohol (I) (trans/cis=99/l; 377 mg (1.0 mmole)) was added to a solution of phosphorus trichloride (137 mg (1.0 mmole)) in toluene (1.5 ml) at room temperature and the mixture was stirred for 3 hours. After completion of reaction, the reaction mixture was poured into water, followed by extraction with ethyl acetate. The resultant organic layer was washed in sequence with an aqueous saturated sodium bicarbonate solution and saturated saline and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and the solvent<br><br>
was distilled off to obtain a yellow oily crude product. When the crude product thus obtained was quantified by HPLC, the yield of allyl halide (II) was 58% (tans/cis=92/8).<br><br>
