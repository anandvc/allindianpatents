The new compounds of general formula (I) may contain an asymmetric carbon<br>
atom and can therefore be prepared as optical isomers or racemates. The racemates of<br>
compounds (I) can be resolved into their optical isomers using conventional methods,<br>
such as separation by chiral chromatography or fractionated crystallisation from their<br>
diasteroisomer salts for example. Similarly, they can also be obtained from asymmetric<br>
synthesis using chiral precursors.<br>
The present invention also relates to physiologicaly acceptable salts of the<br>
compounds of general formula (I), in particular addition salts of mineral acids such as<br>
hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, phosphoric acid, sulphuric acid, nitric acid and<br>
addition salts of organic acids such as p-toluensulphonic acid or methansulphonic acid.<br>
The new derivatives of general formula (I), in which X is an atom of oxygen and<br>
R1 and R2 have the hereinbefore defined meaning, can be prepared according to methods<br>
A or B which are described below.<br>
METHOD A:<br>
The compounds of general formula (I) can be prepared by reacting the derivative<br>
of chloropyrimidine (III), where R1 has the hereinbefore defined meaning, with a<br>
derivative of piperazine of general formula (IV) in which X and R2 have the hereinbefore<br>
defined meaning.<br>
The reaction is carried out in an organic solvent, for example in an chlorinated<br>
hydrocarbon such as dichloromethane or chloroform, a linear or cyclic ether such as 1,2-<br>
dimethoxyethane, tetrahydrofurane or dioxane, a aprotic polar solvent such as pyridine,<br>
dimethylsulphoxide or dimethylformamide or any other type of solvent appropriate for<br>
carry out a aromatic nucleophilic substitution reaction. The reaction can be carried out<br>
in the presence of a mineral or organic base such as an aliphatic amine, preferably<br>
triethylamine or M-methylmorphine by stirring at a temperature lying between room<br>
temperature and the boiling point of the solvent for a period of time lying between ten<br>
minutes and twenty-four hours, the preferring conditions being a period of time between<br>
thirty minutes and five hours.<br>
METHOD B:<br>
By reaction of the amine of formula (V):<br>
in which R1 has the hereinbefore defined meaning with a carboxylic acid of the general<br>
formula R2COOH (VI), in which R2 has the hereinbefore defined meaning, or with a salt<br>
of said acid or also with a derivative reagent R2COY (VII).<br>
Examples of salts include salts of alkali metals such as sodium salts and<br>
potassium salts, alkaline earth salts such as calcium salts and magnesium salts,<br>
ammonium salts, and salts of organic bases such as triethylamine, trimethylamine,<br>
pyridine and picoline.<br>
Examples of derivative reagents of general formula R2COY (VII) in which Y is a<br>
halogen atom preferably a chlorine atom or a bromine atom, an azide group (-N3), a 1-<br>
imidazolyl, a O-CO-R4, in which R4 can be an alkyl or aryl radical of 1 to 6 carbon<br>
atoms, preferably substituted with one or several halogen atoms, or a group OR5 where<br>
R5 represents an aromatic group of one or. two rings substituted with one or several<br>
halogen atoms or nitro radicals, the preferred groups being 4-nitrophenyl, 2,4-<br>
dinitrophenyl, pentachlofophenyl, pentafluorophenyl, 1-benzotriazolyl o N-succinimide.<br>
Similarly, instead of using the aforementioned derivative reagents, compounds of general<br>
formula (I) can be prepared directly by reaction of the amine (V) with the carboxylic acid<br>
or general formula (VI). In this case it is preferable that the reaction proceeds in the<br>
presence of reagents that activate the carbonyl groups such as N,N"-<br>
dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, diisopropylcarbondiimide or 3-(3-dimethylamino)propyl-l-<br>
ethycarbodiimide. This reaction can also be carried out using the said carbodiimidas in<br>
the presence of 1-benzotriazol or N-hydroxysuccinimide. The acids of general formula<br>
(VI) and the amine of formula (V) also react directly in the presence of N,N"-<br>
carbonyldiimidazol or of propanophosphonic acid anhydride.<br>
The reaction is carried out in an organic solvent, for example in an<br>
chlorinated hydrocarbon such as dichloromethane or chloroform, a linear or cyclic ether<br>
such as 1,2-dimethoxyethane, tetrahydrofurane or dioxane, a aprotic polar solvent such<br>
as pyridine, dimethylsulphoxide or dimethylformamide or any other type of solvent<br>
appropriate for carry out a aromatic nucleophilic substitution reaction. The reaction can<br>
be carried out in the presence of a mineral or organic base such as an aliphatic amine,<br>
preferably triethylamine or M-methylmorphine by stirring at a temperature lying between<br>
room temperature and the boiling point of the solvent for a period of time lying between<br>
ten minutes and twenty-four hours, the preferring conditions being a period of time<br>
between thirty minutes and five hours.<br>
METHOD C<br>
The new derivatives of general formula (I), in which X is an atom of sulphur and<br>
R1 and R2 have the hereinbefore defined meaning, can be prepared according to the<br>
following method.<br>
By treating a compound of a compound of general formula (I), in which R1 and<br>
R2 have the hereinbefore defined meaning and in which X is an atom of oxygen, with<br>
Lawesson"s reagent (2,4-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)-1,3,2,4-dithiadiphosphaethano-2,4-<br>
disulphuro) or with phosphorous pentasulphide, the corresponding thioamides are<br>
obtained in which X is a sulphur atom:<br>
The reaction is carried out in an organic solvent such as toluene, benzene,<br>
heptane, pyridine or tetrahydrofurane. The reaction is continually shaken at a<br>
temperature lying between room temperature and the boiling point of the solvent for a<br>
period of time of between one hour and twenty-four hours, preferably carrying out the<br>
reaction at 80°C for a time between one hour and sixteen hours.<br>
METHOD D:<br>
The salts of the compounds of general formula (I) can be prepared by reaction<br>
with a mineral acid such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, phosphoric acid,<br>
sulphuric acid, nitric acid or with an organic acid such as p-toluensulphonic acid or<br>
methansuiphonic acid in an appropriate solvent such as methanol, ethanol, ethyl ether,<br>
ethyl acetate, acetonitrile or acetone, being obtained with the normal precipitation<br>
techniques or crystallisation of the corresponding salts.<br>
The invention provides pharmaceutical compositions which comprise, as well as a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, at least one compound of general formula (I) or<br>
one of their physiologically acceptable salts. The invention also relates to the use of a<br>
compound of general formula (I) and their physiologically acceptable salts in the<br>
elaboration of a medicament with activity in the mammalian, central nervous system,<br>
including activity in the human central nervous system in particular, in the manufacture of<br>
a medicament with sedative, anticonvulsive, sleep-inducing and general anaesthetic<br>
activity.<br>
In the examples which follow the preparation of new compounds according to<br>
the invention is indicated. Also described are some typical forms of use for the different<br>
fields of application, as well as medicinal formulas applicable to the compounds of the<br>
invention.<br>
METHOD A:<br>
Example 1. Preparation of 2-[4-(2-furvlcarbonvD-l-piperazinvl1-4-methoxv-<br>
pvrimidine.<br>
A solution of 1.0 g (6.92 mmol) of 2-chloro-4-methoxypyrimidine, 1.49 g (8,30 mmol)<br>
of l-(2-furylcarbonyl)piperazine and 1.39 g (13.84 mmol) of triethylamine in 20 mL of n-<br>
butanol is maintained under gentle reflux conditions overnight. The solvent is<br>
evaporated off under reduced pressure and the crude residue is diluted in chloroform and<br>
washed in water. The organic phase is dried over NaSO4 and evaporated to dryness to<br>
give a crude product which is purified using silica-gel chromatography eluting with ethyl<br>
acetate/petroleum ether 70:30 to yield an oil which solidifies when left to stand. The<br>
solid is suspended in petroleum ether to yield 1.4 g (4.86 mmol) of 2-[4-(2-<br>
furylcarbonyl)-l-piperazinyl]-4-methoxypyrimidine. m.p. = 85-86°C.<br>
METHOD B:<br>
Example 3. Preparation of 4-methoxy-2-"4-(2-thienylcarbonyl)-1-piperazinyl]<br>
pyrimidine<br>
A solution of 1.0 g (5.15 mmol) of 4-methoxy-2-(l-piperazinyl)pyrimidine and 1 mL<br>
(7.18 mmol) of triethylamine in 30 mL of CH2Cl2 is cooled to 0° C and 0.76 g (5.18<br>
mmol) of 2-thienylcarbonyl chloride slowly added. The solution is kept at 0° C for an<br>
hour and then the temperature allowed to rise to room temperature. The organic phase<br>
is washed with H2O, dried over NaSO4 and the solvent removed under reduced pressure.<br>
The crude residue is dissolved in ethyl ether crystallising 1:0 g (3.28 mmol) of 4-<br>
methoxy-2-[4-(2-thiencarbonyl)-l-piperazinyl]pryimidine. m.p. = 71-73° C<br>
Example 12. Preparation of 4-methoxy-2-[4-(3-thienylcarbonyl)-l-piperazinyl]<br>
pyrimidine.<br>
To a solution of 1.0 g (7.81 mmol) of 3-thienylcarboxylic acid and 1 mL (7.86 mmol) of<br>
triethylamine in 30 mL of CH2Cl2 cooled to 0° C 0.84 g (7.81 mmol) of ethyl<br>
chloroformiate are added. The mixture is maintained at 0° C for 20 minutes and then 1.5<br>
g (7.81. mmol) of 4-methoxy-2-(l-piperazinyl) pyrimidine dissolved in 10 mL of CH2Cl2<br>
are added to the solution. The temperature is allowed to rise to room temperature and<br>
the solution continually stirred for 2 hours and the organic phase is washed with H2O,<br>
dried over NaSO4 and the solvent evaporated off under reduced pressure. The resulting<br>
oil is treated with ethyl ether to yield a solid which is recrystallised from ethanol/H2O to<br>
give 0.8 g (2.63 mmol) of 4-methoxy-2-[4-(3-thienylcarbonyl)-l-piperazinyl]pyrimidine.<br>
m.p. = 90-92° C.<br>

pvrimidine.<br>
To a solution of 0.83 g (5.15 mmol) of indol-2-carboxylic acid in 15 mL of dry THF 0.83<br>
g (5.15 mmol) of N,N"-carbonyldiimidazol is added. After 30 minutes 1.0 g (5.15 mmol)<br>
of 4 methoxy-2-(l-piperazinyl) pyrimidine is added to the solution and it is left overnight<br>
with continuous stirring. The solvent is eliminated under reduced pressure and H2O<br>
added. This produces a precipitate which is filtered and dried, to give 1.7 g (5.04 mmol)<br>
of 2-[4-(2-indorylcarbonyl)-l-piperazinyl]-4-methoxypyrimidine. m.p. = 202-203° C.<br>
METHOD C<br>

methoxyphenyl)-l,32,4-dithiadiphosphaethano-2,4-disulphide) added. The mixture is<br>
heated to 80-90° C for 16 hours. Ethyl ether is added, basic water is used to wash the<br>
residue and the organic extract is dried with NaSO4 and the solvent evaporated off under<br>
reduced pressure. The resulting crude residue is crystallised with ethyl ether-petroleum<br>
ether to give 160 mg (0.5 mmol) of 2-(4-thiobenzoyl-l-piperazinyl)-4-<br>
methoxypyrimidine. m.p. = 125-129° C.<br>

acetate and a few drops of a solution of ethyl ether/hydrochloric acid are added, thus<br>
obtaining a precipitate which is filtered and dried, to yield 1.07 g (3.29 mmol) of 2-[4-(2-<br>
furylcarbonyl)-l-piperazinyl]-4-methoxypyrimidine chlorohydrate. m.p. = 162-164° C.<br>

Sleep-inducing activity in mice<br>
The sleep-inducing activity of the products of the present invention have been<br>
studied, evaluating the their capacity to increase the sleep time induced by barbital,<br>
according to a modification of the method described by David Sudgen (J. Pharmacol.<br>
Exp. Ther., 1983, 227, 3).<br>
Fifteen minutes after the administration of barbital (150 mg/Kg, i.v.), the mice<br>
were treated with the product of the study at an initial dose of 100 mg/Kg (i.p.). For the<br>
most active products a dosage efficacy 50 (DE50) was determined. The results for some<br>
of the products of the invention are shown in Table 2, taking meprobamate as the<br>
reference product.<br>
General anaesthetic activity<br>
The general anaesthetic activity was study in mice, injecting the product of the<br>
study in the caudal vein. The start and duration time of sleep were recorded. The results<br>
for some of the products of the patent are shown in Table 3 and it can be seen that they<br>
show a clear anaesthetic activity with respect to the reference compound (Propofol),<br>
with the animals recovering later.<br>
Sedative activity<br>
The sedative activity of some of the products on the locomotive activity of mice<br>
at different dosages has been studied. The technique described by T.G. Heffheren J.<br>
Pharm. Exp. Ther., 1989, 251, 105-112 has been followed. The measurement of the<br>
locomotive activity is carried out by dividing the rats into groups of four and determining<br>
the movement of the animals in an automated fashion using a video installation and the<br>
SMART program (Letica S.A.) for image analysis. The measurement of activity started<br>
5 minutes after the administration of the product via i.p. and continued for twenty<br>
minutes. The results (Figure 1) show the sedative effect of the compounds tested.<br>
Muscular relaxant activity<br>
The muscular relaxant activity has been studied in the products of the invention<br>
by evaluated their effect on the abdominal body tone of mice, following the method<br>
described by S. IRWING (Gordon Res. Conf. On Medicinal Chem., 1959, p. 133).<br>
The mice received the products under study at a dosage of 80 mg/kg, via I.p.,<br>
and at different times after administration (1/2, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 hours) the body tone and<br>
the abdominal tone was evaluated looking at the muscular tension compared to the<br>
control animals.<br>
The results listed in Table 4 show that many of the products are noticeably active<br>
as muscular relaxants. This effect lasts longer than for propofol or zolpidem, which were<br>
used as reference products.<br>
Table 4           Miorelaxant activity in the Trwing mouse test.<br>
[Dosage = 80 mg/kg, i.p.]<br>
Analgesic activity<br>
The analgesic activity of the products of the invention have been studied by<br>
evaluation of their effect in the test of contortions induced by phenylbenzoquinone in<br>
mice, following the method described by Siegmund E., and coworkers (Proc. Soc. Exp.<br>
Biol. Med. 1957, 95: 729-731).<br>
The mice received the products of the study, a different dosage levels, and one<br>
hour later they received an injections i.p. of 5 mg/kg of phenylbenzoquinone. The<br>
contortions of the mice were registered for the following fifteen minutes and compared<br>
with the contortions of the control group. The DE50 (dosage efficacy 50) of the<br>
compound of Example 4 is shown. This compound showed a better analgesic activity<br>
than aspirin, both when administered subcutaneously and orally.<br>
