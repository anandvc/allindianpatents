				<td>Device on a Card for Cotton, Chemical Fibres or Similar Items,<br>
An Which There is At Least One Cover Rod with a Cover Fitting<br>
The invention pertains to a device on a card for cotton, chemical fibres or similar items, in .<br>
which there is at least one cover rod with a cover fitting, whereby the cover fitting is fastened<br>
on to the cover rod and lies opposite the fitting of a roller, e.g. the drum.<br>
In a known device, the cover rod consists of a rear part and a carrier body with a base surface.<br>
Against the base surface (fitting support part), stretching in a longitudinal direction, a fitting<br>
strip (flexible fitting) is fastened. The fitting strip includes a carrier element consisting of<br>
se\eral textile layers, in which several wire hooks (fitting peaks) are fastened. The fitting<br>
strip is fixed over the oblong sides of the carrier body by means of two clamps. The clamps<br>
enclose with one of their ends the longitudinally directed edge regions of the fitting strip and<br>
grip with their other end into recesses of the carrier body. In practice, the clamps are made of<br>
meal strips, whose one oblong edge is punched into the textile material. The textile material<br>
of the fitting strip is fastened in a positive fit during assembly on to the carrier body of the<br>
cover rod under high stress. The clamps thereby exercise tensile forces in such a way, that the<br>
textile material gets deformed in a ball shape away from the base surface, so that even the<br>
fitting peaks are arranged in an undesirable manner outwards on a convex shaped envelope.<br>
The cover set thus produced has in unused condition a precision of 0.05 mm in height and<br>
evenness. Through usage, the height differences in the set get enlarged to approx. 0.2 mm.<br>
By post-sharpening the fitting on the machine, the precision is improved marginally. After<br>
approx. 400t of fibre material throughput, the cover fitting is so worn out that it has to be<br>
replaced. In order to dismantle the metal clamps, the cover rod is chucked. With the help of a<br>
lever and pincers the positive fit is released. The significant forces during assembly and<br>
during dismantling work disadvantageously on the shape stability of the cover rod.<br>
Additionally, undesired tolerances occur during production of the cover rod body. The<br>
memioned disadvantages have the result, that the fitting peak of the clothed cover rod has to<br>
be overground (levelled).<br>
It has already been suggested (EP 0 887 445) that the fitting strip is fastened on to a beam,<br>
e.g. against a steel band sole. The even steel band sole is introduced between guide grooves<br>
opening inwards in the edge regions of the base portion of the cover rod (profile), whereby the<br>
fitting strip is fastened on to the cover rod. The production of this cover rod is production-<br><br>
technically and assembly-wise cumbersome. Particularly, it is disturbing that the steel band<br>
sole and the guide grooves have to the produced absolutely with precision in order to provide<br>
a sufficient retention during operation, which otherwise would make replacement very<br>
difficult.<br>
It is therefore the task of this invention to create a device of the kind described above, which<br>
would avoid the mentioned disadvantages, which would especially allow a shape-stable<br>
clothed cover rod in a simple manner and a simpler production of the cover rod and<br>
replacement of the fitting strips.<br>
As the outer side of the beam and the carrier body of the cover rod are in a positive grip with<br>
one another and the beam is fixed in the recess by an additional fastening element, a simple<br>
production of clothed cover rod and replacement of the fitting strip is possible. All<br>
production tolerances of cover rod, the fitting and during assembly (including dismantling),<br>
are eliminated. With the clothed cover rod as per the invention, a summation of the tolerances<br>
during assembly and dismantling of the cover fitting, the technologically harmful level-<br>
grinding and worsening of the precision during usage is effectively avoided in an<br>
advantageous manner.<br>
The invention is explained in details below on the basis of design examples with diagram.<br>
The following are shown:<br>

arrows. 'A' denotes the working direction. Fixed carding elements 33 and 34 are arranged<br>
lying opposite to the drum fitting 4a.<br>
According to fig 2, on each side of a card a flexible arc 17 is fixed sideways on to the<br>
machine frame; this arc has several adjusting screws. The flexible arc 17 has a convex outer<br>
surface 17a and an underside 17b. Above the flexible arc 17 there is a slide groove 20, e.g.<br>
made of slidable synthetic substance, which has a convex surface 20a and a concave inner<br>
surface 20b. The concave inner surface 20b lies on the convex outer surface 17a, and can<br>
slide on it in the direction of the arrows B, C. Each cover rod, which can be designed<br>
according to the document EP 0 567 747 A1, consists of a rear part 14a and a carrier body<br>
14b. The carrier body 14b has a base surface 14c, two side surfaces 14d, 14e and two upper<br>
surfaces 14f, 14g (see fig. 3). Each cover rod 14 has against both its ends respectively a cover<br>
rod 14', 14" (see fig. 7b), which respectively encloses two steel pins 141, 142 or 143, 144,<br>
which are fastened with a part in axial direction (see length 1 in fig. 7b) in recesses 13a, 13b<br>
(see fig 7b) of the carrier body 14b, e.g. glued in. The portions of the steel pins 141, 142 (see<br>
fig. 7b) protruding over the front surfaces of the carrier body 14b slide on the convex outer<br>
surface 20a of the slide groove 20 in the direction of the arrow D. Against the underface of<br>
the carrier body 14b, the fitting strip 18 is attached. The peak circle of the cover fittings 19 is<br>
denoted by 21. The drum 4 has on its circumference a drum fitting 4a, e.g. saw-tooth fitting.<br>
The peak circle of the drum fitting 4a is denoted by 22. The distance between the peak circle<br>
21 and the peak circle 22 is denoted by 'a' and is, for example, 3/1000". The distance between<br><br>
the convex outer surface 20a and the peak circle 22 is denoted by 'b'. The distance between<br>
the convex outer surface 20a and the peak circle 21 is denoted by 'c'. The radius of the<br>
convex outer surface 20a is denoted by r1 and the radius of the peak circle 22 is denoted by r2.<br>
The radii r1 and r2 intersect at the centre point M of the drum 4.<br>
According to fig. 3a, in the carrier body 14b of the cover rod 14 which is extruded from<br>
aluminium, there are two oblong holes 14c and 14d (see fig. 6), which extend over the width<br>
and open outwards, which extend towards the centre of the cover rod 14 into hollow<br>
cylindrical openings 14f and 14g. In the openings 14f, 14g, the respective fastening region of<br>
the cover pins 141, 142, 143, 144, are shown. In the centre of the cover rod 14 there is an<br>
oblong groove 141 Stretching over the width, which is open towards the base surface 14c.<br>
Between the ope.ng of 14c and the oblong groove 14i there are several continuous holes 14h<br>
vertical to the oblong groove. The holes 14h have an inner threading which grips into the<br>
outer threading of threaded pins 28 as shown in fig. 3b. The beam 26 as shown in fig. 3c<br>
consists of two metal strips 26a, 26b whose respective end regions are bent rectangular in<br>
same direction, i.e. metal strips 26a in anti-clockwise direction and metal strip 26b in<br>
clockwise direction. The bent region 26' and 26" of the metal strips 26a or 26b are fastened<br>
on to one another by laser welding and hence form an extension 26c which is fastened in the<br>
oblong groove 14i (fig. 3a). The bent regions 26III and 26Iv serve the purpose of additionally<br>
holding the carrier element 23 of the sliding strip 18 (fig. 3d). According to fig. 3d, the fitting<br>
strip 18 consists of fitting peaks 19 (wire hooks) and a carrier element 23 made of textile<br>
material The strength of the carrier element 23 is denoted by f. The wire hooks 19 are<br>
fastened with one of their ends through the surface 26" in the carrier element 23 The other<br>
end of the wire hooks 19, the fitting peaks, are free.<br>
Fig. 4 shows the cover rod 14 according to figures 3a to id in combined condition. The<br>
fitting strip 18 is fixed on one side 261 of the beam 26, e.g. by gluing, and the extension 26c<br>
of the beam 26 is arranged pushed into the oblong groove 14i of the carrier body 14b, so that<br>
the other side 262 (outer side) of the beam 26 and the carrier body 14b grip each other in a<br>
positive grip. The screwed-in threaded pins 28 (see fig. 6a, 6b) stress the extension 26c<br>
against the inner wail of the oblong groove 14i lying opposite to the threaded pin 28, whereby<br>
the beam 26 is fastened on to the cover rod 14 with the fitting strip 18. In addition to the<br>
elements shown in fig. 3a to 3d, according to fig. 4, an intermediate layer 24, e.g. of hardened<br><br>
synthetic resin or similar item, is placed between the inner surface 262 of the beam and the<br>
carrier element 23. The compensation layer 24 can compensate varying distances between<br>
cover rod 14, namely the base surface 14c and the cover fitting 19, namely the covering ends<br>
of the free peaks.<br>
According to fig 5, two oblong grooves 141 and 142 are provided in the carrier body 14b and<br>
grip into the two extension 26c1 or 26c2, which are fastened with threaded pins 28a or 28b.<br>
The threaded pins 28a and 28b grip through the holes 14h1 or 14h2 from different sides lying<br>
opposite to one another.<br>
As shown in fig. 6, between the cover pins 141, 142 and an even plate 25 a rectangular support<br>
element 27a with parallel and even surfaces is attached, and between the cover pins 143, 144<br>
and the plate 25 a further rectangular support plate 27b of same height h is fixed on the plate<br>
25. With this device and (not shown) further side stud elements or similar things (e.g.<br>
shiftable bordering surfaces for compensation layer 24 and/or the carrier element 23), the<br>
fitting peaks 19 of the fitting strip 18 can be positioned on the plate 25 and the cover rod 14<br>
with the pins 141, 142, 143, 144 can be positioned on the support elements 27a, 27b.<br>
Subsequently, the compensation layer 24 is brought in between the beam 26 and carrier<br>
element 23. This can be done by casting, spraying, painting, inserting or any other similar<br>
method. The doughy compensation layer 24 distributes itself in the intermediate space and<br>
fills ii in a compensatory manner.<br>
In the version of the invention as shown in figures 6a and 6b, the holes 14h1 and 14h2 - seen<br>
in the direction of the length h - are arranged staggered with one another. On opposite sides<br>
of the carrier body 14b, there are on top of one another several threaded pins 28a and 28b,<br>
which fasten the extension 26c in the oblong groove 14i (see fig. 4).<br><br>
