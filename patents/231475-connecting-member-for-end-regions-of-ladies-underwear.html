				<td>Connecting element for end portions of garments to be joined<br>
together<br>
The invention relates to a connecting element for the end portions of<br>
straps in undergarments, for example the end portion of underbust bands<br>
of brassieres.<br>
Such connecting elements are usually sewn on to both ends of the<br>
underbust band and consist usually of an eyelet or loop tape and its<br>
corresponding eye hook tape.<br>
To manufacture the eyelet tape, the eyelets are first attached to a<br>
continuous base tape in a specified order. This is done by sewing several<br>
so called folding tapes in a partially overlapping arrangement along both<br>
longitudinal sides of the base tape with its sides folded in alongside.<br>
While the folding tapes are sewn onto the base tape, the eyelets are also<br>
attached to the folding tape and base tape along seams which are sewn<br>
parallel to the sides of the base tape. The base tape with the attached<br>
folding tapes is then cut vertically to its sides into individual eyelet<br>
sections.<br>
In known manufacturing processes, the cutting of the individual eyelet<br>
tapes from the continuous tape is performed using a thermo-welding<br>
process, e.g. the ultrasound welding process, which causes the cutting<br>
edge of the base tape and the folding tapes to be joined together. This<br>
process of cutting the eyelet tape from the continuous base tape and<br>
folding tapes is functionally efficient and, therefore, economical. However,<br>
it creates hard and very sharp joints. Since the base tape and the folding<br>
tapes are cut vertically to their sides into individual section,<br>
these joint edges form the side edge of the eyelet tape.<br>
With undergarments, which are worn on the skin such as<br>
brassieres, where the undorbust tapes and straps exert a certain<br>
pressure on the skin, thttre is a danger that the joint edges of<br>
the eyelet tapes, which are also worn on the skin, may cut into<br>
the skin . This leads to an uncomfortable wearing sensation that<br>
may also cause skin irritations.<br>
The same conditions apply to the hook tapes, which are usually<br>
also manufactured using a base tape. The latter is first formed<br>
into a kind of tube by -folding it alongside both sides whereby<br>
the folded in areas are slightly overlapping and are basically of<br>
equal width. The hooks are to be placed in the overlapping area by<br>
way of a seam parallel to the sides of the base tape, which joins<br>
together all layers of the base tape simultaneously.<br>
Again, the base tape with the attached hooks is cut vertically to<br>
its sides into individual hook taps sections. Before cutting the<br>
., individual hook tape sections, the base tape is foled in the<br>
centre longitudinally approximately parallel to its sides,<br>
whereby the layer holding the hooks is positioned on a hook-free<br>
layer.<br>
If the process of separating the individual hook tapes from the<br>
continuous base tape is also performed using the thereto-welding<br>
process, this separating process causes the cutting edges, of the<br>
various layers of the base tape to be joined together. Since the<br>
cutting edges are again cut vertically to the sides of the base<br>
tape, these joint edges also form the front side of the edge of<br>
the hook tape. Here, again, the joint edges of the hook tapes,<br>
when worn directly on the skin cause an uncomfortable wearing<br>
sensation, which may lead to skin irritations.<br>
This invention aims at creating a connecting element for straps of<br>
undergarments, for example underbust bands of brassieres which, while<br>
using the thermo-welding process makes it possible to manufacture hook<br>
and eyelet tapes without sharp joint edges.<br>
The matching hook tape is processed in the following ways the cutoff<br>
welding seams are located within the hook tape between the hook-free<br>
area and the hook-bearing area.<br>
Such an arrangement of cutoff welding seams can be easily obtained if<br>
the cutoff welding seams are positioned between the hook-free section<br>
and the underlying hook-bearing section by turning the seam inside out.<br>
In this way, the cutoff welding seams are placed in the inside of the hook<br>
tape so that the edges that are exposed to the skin consist of the<br>
unwekled material of the hook tape.<br>
The manufacturing of a continuous hook tape can be done by using a<br>
continuous base tape with attached hooks. Before cutting a section of the<br>
base tape within its hook-free end, the base tape is folded parallel to its<br>
sides so that the nooks are covered by a hook-free portion. This section is<br>
then cut off by cutoff welding seams. The two layers are thus joined<br>
together along their cutting edges, thereby allowing the resulting hook<br>
tape to be turned inside-out so that the cutoff welding seams end up in<br>
the inside of the hook tape between the two layers. It is advantageous for<br>
the folding line to be within the hook-free area away from the side of the<br>
fastening seam.<br>
The matching eyelet tape is processed in the following way: the eyelet<br>
tape is given a cover tape to be placed on its eyelet-free area and both<br>
layers are joined together by cutoff welding seams. The cutoff welding<br>
seams are located within the eyelet-free area of the eyelet tape in<br>
between of the latter and the cover tape.<br>
Such an arrangement of cutoff welding seams can be obtained if the<br>
cutoff welding seams are positioned between the eyelet-free section and<br>
the underlying eyelet-bearing section by turning the eyelet tape inside out.<br>
Placing a cover tape over the eyelet-free area of the eyelet tape, not only<br>
allows to turn the sharp pining edges created by the cutoff welding seam<br>
inside the eyelet tape, but also is a means of covering up the fastening<br>
seams of the eyelets which in turn increases the comfort of the eyelet<br>
tape.<br>
In order to position the cutoff welding seam that joins together the cover<br>
tape and the eyelet tape within the area of the base tape, it is best to use<br>
a cover tape that consists of an elastic material, preferably an elastic<br>
fabric.<br>
The manufacturing of a continuous eyelet tape using a base tape with<br>
attached eyelets which have been cut into individual sections through<br>
cutoff welding seams, can be achieved by placing a cover tape before<br>
cutting the eyelet tape into sections over the eyelet-bearing area of the<br>
eyelet-free ends of the base tape. Then, when cutting this section through<br>
cutoff welding seams, the base tape as well as the cover tape will be cut<br>
through while joining the base tape and the cover tape along their cutting<br>
edges. The resulting eyelet tape is then turned inside out in order to bring<br>
the cutoff welding seams between the eyelet-free area of the eyelet tape<br>
and the cover tape.<br>
This process makes it possible to keep up the production of<br>
continuous tapes by turning the cutoff weding seams inside the<br>
eylet tape so that those edges which can be exposed to the skin<br>
are formed by the outside of the cover tape which is not welded.<br>
The matching hook tape is processed in the following way<br>
according to this inventions the hook tape is given a cover tape<br>
to be placed on its hook—free areas and both layers are joined<br>
together with cutoff welding seams. The cutoff welding seams are<br>
located within the hook-free area of the hook tape inbetween of<br>
the latter and the cover tape.<br>
Such an arrangement of cutoff welding seams can be obtained if<br>
the cutoff welding seams are positioned between the cover tape<br>
and the underlying hook-bearing section by turning the hook tape<br>
inside out.<br>
Placing a cover tape over the hook-free area of the cover tape,<br>
not only allows to turn the sharp joining edges, created by the<br>
cutoff welding seam, inside the hook tape, but also is a means of<br>
covering up the fastening seams of the hooks which in turn<br>
increases the comfort of the hook tape.<br>
In order to position the separating welding seam that joins<br>
together the cover tape and the hook tape within the area of the<br>
base tape, it is best to use a cover tape that consists of an<br>
elastic material, preferably an elastic fabric.<br>
the manufacturing of a continuous hook tape using a base tape with<br>
attached hooks which have been cut into individual section through cutoff<br>
welding seams, can be achieved by placing a cover tape before cutting<br>
the hook tape into sections over the hook-bearing area of the hook-free<br>
ends of the base tape. Then, when cutting this section through cutoff<br>
welding seams, the base tape as well as the cover tape will be cut<br>
through while joining the base tape and the cover tape along their cutting<br>
edges. The resulting hook tape is then turned inside out in order to bring<br>
the cutoff welding seams between the hook-free area of the hook tape<br>
and the cover tape.<br>
This process makes it possible to keep up the production of continuous<br>
tapes by turning the separating welding seams inside the hook tape so<br>
that those edges which can be exposed to the skin are formed by the<br>
outside of the cover tape which is not welded.<br>

Figure 1 shows a base tape (1) of a hook tape (2) with<br>
attached hooks (3) in prearranged intervals. These are attached<br>
to the base tape (1) through a fastening seen parallel to the<br>
longitudinal axis of the base tape (2), whereby its longitudinal<br>
axis is at a right angle to the longitudinal axis of the base<br>
tape (2). In the illustration application example, the lateral<br>
sides of the base tape (1) are folded in towards, one another and<br>
are overlapping by a certain measure. The upper side of the base<br>
tape in Fig. 2 may be folded inwards to create a neat edge and<br>
lies above the opposite longer side (6) . The fastening seam (4)<br>
serves at the same time as way to fix the folds of the base tape<br>
(1), which look like a tube-shaped structure with overlapping<br>
hems. A lining may be placed inside the base tape (1).<br>
The shorter side (5) forms, therefore, a hook—bearing area (7)<br>
whereas the longer side (6) forms a hook-free area (8) . The<br>
areas (7) and (8) may be of equal or different sizes.<br>
In Fig. 1, the front end of the base tape (1) along a<br>
predetermined length is to be folded along a fold line formed<br>
preferably by the fastening seam, so that the hook-free area (8)<br>
lies over the hook-bearing area (7). The hooks (3) are,<br>
therefore, covered by the hook-free area (8) within the fold.<br>
With areas (7) and (8) positioned as illustrated above,<br>
successive sections of certain lengths are separated from the<br>
base tape (1) by means of a thermo-welding process, e.g.<br>
ultrasound. The length of the sections determining the length<br>
(or width, in other words) of the hook tape (2) to be<br>
manufactured according to the portion it will be used in when<br>
being worn as part of for example a brassiere.<br>
The cutoff welding tools used for this application are designed<br>
in such a way that they create a cutoff welding seam (10) in the<br>
first section as well as the subsequent second section. The<br>
resulting cutting edges (9) of the hook-bearing area (7) are<br>
thus welded together with the cutting edges (11) of the hook-free<br>
area (8). This creates a hardened and very sharp connecting edge<br>
(12) which are located on the outer edge of the respective area.<br>
During this process, the hooks (3) remain covered by the hook-<br>
free area (8) (Fig.3 and 5).<br>
The process that comas next is turning the tape inside out.<br>
Through the process the respective section is turned in such a<br>
way that allows on the one hand for the hooks (3) of the hook-<br>
free area (8) to be uncovered and on the other hand for the<br>
connecting edge (12) (cutoff welding edge 10) to be turned inside<br>
the finished hook tape (2). Both boundary edges (13,14) of the<br>
hook tape (2) that come in contact with the skin when worn are<br>
thus formed by the material of the base tape (1) (Fig.4).<br>
The hook tape (2) thus manufactured, may be sewn in the usual way<br>
to the strap of a garment, e.g. underbust band of a brassiere.<br>
Hereby, the upper and lower areas of the hook tape (2) that are<br>
sewn to the strap are formed by the boundary edges (13,14).<br>
Fig. 6 shows the base tape (21) an eyelet tape (22) with attached<br>
eyelets (23) in prearranged intervals. As can be seen in Fig. 6 ,<br>
several folding tapes (24) which are positioned along the<br>
longitudinal axis of the base tape have been sewn with fastening<br>
seams (25) to the base tape. These fastening seams (29) are sewn<br>
parallel to the longitudinal axis of the ba*e tape (23). The<br>
fastening seams (25) serve it the same time as a way to fasten<br>
the eyelet (23) to the base tape (21) the longitudinal axis of<br>
which is basically at a right angle to the base tape (21). This<br>
base tape has therefore, an eyelet-bearing area (26) on one of<br>
its side and a a eyelet-free area (27) on its other side.<br>
The base tape (21) is preferable manufactured using a soft<br>
material. It may be formed by a flat tape, the lateral sides of<br>
which, not in the illustration, are folded in towards one another<br>
and are overlapping by a certain measure. The base tape (21)<br>
forms, therefore, a tube-like structure with overlapping hems. A<br>
lining may be placed inside the base tape (1). The folding edges<br>
(28,29) of the base tape (21 ) are both, therefore, front sides of<br>
the eyelet tape (22) (referring to the usage as eyelet tape (22)<br>
for brassieres).<br>
As can be seen in Fig. 6, a cover tape (30) is placed ovtr the<br>
eyelet tape area (26) of the base tape (21) which covers the<br>
eyelets (23).<br>
With the base tape (21) and cover tape (30) positioned as<br>
illustrated above, successive sections of certain lengths are<br>
separated from the base tape (21) by Means of a thermo-welding<br>
process. The length of the sections determines the length (or<br>
width, in otherwords) of the eyelet tape (22) to be manufactured<br>
according to the position it will be used in when being worn<br>
as part of ( for example) a brassiere.<br>
Here, too, the separating welding tools used for this application<br>
is designed in such a way that it creates a cutoff welding seam<br>
(31* 32) in the first section as well as the subsequent second<br>
section. The resulting cutting edges (34) of the eyelet tape (22)<br>
are thus welded together with the cutting edges (35) of the cover<br>
tape (30). This creates a hardened and also very sharp<br>
connecting edge (36) which is located on the outer<br>
edge of the respective area. During this process, the eyelets(23) remain<br>
covered by the welded on cover tape (30).<br>
The process that comes next is turning the tape inside out. Through this<br>
process the respective section is turned in such a way that allows the<br>
cover tape (30) to reach from the eyelet-bearing area (26) to the eyelet-<br>
free area (27) hereby leaving the eyelets (23) uncovered. This permits at<br>
the same time, for the connecting edges (36) (cutoff welding edge 31. 32)<br>
to be turned inside the finished eyelet tape (22). Both boundary edges<br>
(37. 38) of the eyelet tape (22) that come in contact with the skin when<br>
worn, consist thus of the cover tape (30).<br>
The eyelet tape (22) thus manufactured, may be sewn in the usual way to<br>
the strap of a garment, e.g. underbust band of a brassiere. Hereby, the<br>
upper and lower areas of the eyelet tape 22 that are sewn to the strap are<br>
formed by the boundary edges (37,38).<br>
We have so far based ourselves on the assumption that the separation of<br>
individual sections of the hook tape (2) as well as the eyelet tape (22) is<br>
performed at two places through one cutoff welding seam, respectively.<br>
This can be performed by a relatively simple cutoff welding tool. This has<br>
the added advantage of not creating any wastage.<br>
However, the framework of this invention also permits the use of a mold<br>
cutoff welding tool for the separation of the various sections from the hook<br>
tape (2) and/or eyelet tape (22). These tools would make it possible to<br>
weld both separating welding seams simultaneously in the respective<br>
sections.<br>
The hook tape (52) manufactured as described above. can be sewn in the<br>
usual way to the strap of garments, e.g. underbust bands of brassieres.<br>
The upper and lower areas of the hook tape (52) that is sewn to the strap<br>
of the brassiere are formed by the boundary edges (59. 60).<br>
As aforementioned, we start from the fact that the separation of the<br>
individual sections from the hook tape (52) creates a cutoff welding seam<br>
in two sections, respectively. This can be done with a relatively simple<br>
cutoff welding tool and has the added advantage that there is no wastage<br>
of base tape (51).<br>
However, the framework of this invention also permits the use of mold<br>
cutoff welding tool for the separation of the various sections of the hook<br>
tape (52). This enables the user to perform both separating welding<br>
seams of the respective section, simultaneously.<br>
The mold cutoff welding tool used to separate the sections from the base<br>
tape (51) of the hook tape (52) would then only require to be equipped<br>
with 2 straight sonotrodes to be placed at the distance equivalent to the<br>
length of the individual sections.<br>
Once again, it is possible to use a U-shaped sonotrode for the separation<br>
of sections from base tape (51) of the hook tape (52), which enables to<br>
perform both separating welding seams (64, 65) at the same time as the<br>
cross welding seam (69) located between them. In this way, the two<br>
parallel arms of the U-shaped sonotrode make it possible to perform both<br>
cutoff welding seams (64) and (65), and the crossbar located within the<br>
area of one of the two folding edges (59, 60) that links both arms enables<br>
to simultaneously perform the cross welding seam (69) which can be a<br>
normal welding seam (i.e. not a separating welding seam).<br>
This, however, also creates a hardened connecting edge in the area of<br>
the folding edge (59), which may at first be seen as disadvantageous. But<br>
since the process of turning the hook tape (52) inside out makes it<br>
possible to turn this connecting edge between its hook-free area(62) and<br>
the cover tape 
advantage being that this allows to simultaneously harden the<br>
respective folding edge. If the cross welding seam (69) is<br>
intended to be placed in the end portion of the hook tape (52)<br>
which will not be connected to the strap, then this way of<br>
hardening the respective folding edge will improve the appearance<br>
of the hook tape (52).<br>
