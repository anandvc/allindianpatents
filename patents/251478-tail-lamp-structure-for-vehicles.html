[4]	<br>
In the tail lamp structure for a vehicle, since it relates significantly to the design of its appearance, it has been required to have high flexibility in design, and hence it is required to devise the arrangement structure of a light-emitting diode board (sub-board) for mounting light emitting diodes (LED) thereon, a control element board (main board) for mounting a control element for controlling the light-emitting diode, a housing for storing the light-emitting diode board and the control element board, a lens for covering the housing, a harness (wiring member) extended from the control element board and led outward from the housing, and a connector attached to the distal end of the harness.<br>
[5]	<br>
In particular, in the case of the tail lamp structure using the light-emitting diode, the dimension in the vertical direction can be reduced easily, but the dimension thereof in the fore-and-aft direction of a vehicle body is apt to be increased. Therefore, it has been required to contrive ways for miniaturization.<br>
[6]	<br>
In addition, in the tail lamp structure in the related art, since upper portions of the housing and the lens are covered by a tail cover, a different member (tail cover) is required for covering the tail lamp of the vehicle in the mounted state, which results in increase in the number of parts. Therefore, further upsizing of the structure has been a problem to be solved.<br>

Fig. 11 is a cross-sectional view taken along a line 11-11 in Fig. 6, showing a side cross-section of the tail lamp structure 60. In the motorcycle (vehicle) 10 shown in Fig. 1 including the rear fender 43 covering over the upper portion of the rear wheel 35 (seeFig.2), the mud guard cover 4 7 covering over the rear portion of the rear wheel 35, the tail lamp structure 60 is referable to be such that the tail lamp 46 arranged around the rear fender 43 and the mud guard cover 47, the tail lamp 46 being a tail lamp having light-emitting diodes 81... as the light sources, and the tail lamp is referable to be composed of the light-emitting diode board 82 for placing the light-emitting diodes 81... thereon, the control element board 84 for placing the control element 83 (see Fig. 6) for controlling the light-emitting diodes 81... thereon, the housing 87 for collectively accommodating the light-emitting diode board 82 and the control element board 84, and the lens 88 for covering the housing 87, and to be such that the control element board 84 is arranged downwardly of the light-emitting diode board 82.<br>
[51]	<br>
For example, it is preferable if the depth of the tail lamp of the vehicle can be reduced, because the entire length of the vehicle can be reduced, and a space with respect to the rear wheel can be secured sufficiently.<br>
[52]	<br>
In other words, by arranging the control element board 84 downwardly of the light-emitting diode board 82, the depth of the tail lamp 46 is set to be thin. Consequently, the entire length of the motorcycle 10 (see Fig. 1) can be reduced. Alternatively, the sufficient space with respect to the rear wheel 3 5 can be secured.<br>
In the drawing, reference numeral 115... designates mounting screws for mounting the light-emitting diode board 82 to the housing 87, reference numeral 116 designates a mounting screw for mounting the control element board 84 to the housing 87, and reference numeral 117 designates a mounting screw for mounting the inner lens (diffuser panel) 85 to the lens 88.<br>
[53]	<br>
In the drawing, reference numeral 128 designates an outer lens portion, reference numeral 129 designates an inner lens portion, and the lens body portion 112 is formed to have a two-layer structure. By disposing the clear outer lens portion 128 on the outer side and the inner lens portion 129 having a fine cut on the inner side, the clear tail lamp 46 providing depth feel can be realized and, since the light-emitting diodes (LED) 81... cannot be seen from the outside, difference between ON and OFF can easily be recognized.<br>
[54]	<br>
Also, by arranging the control element board 84 rearwardly of the light-emitting diode board 82 with respect to the vehicle body, the depth of the tail lamp 46 can be reduced. Also, maintenanceability of the tail lamp 46 can be improved.<br>
[55]	<br>
Fig. 12 is a cross-sectional view taken along a line 12-12 in Fig. 6, and the tail lamp structure 60 is referable to be such that by arranging the control element board 84 downwardly of the light-emitting diode board 82, and covering the mud guard cover 4 7 on the lower portion of the lens 88, the control element<br>
board 84 is masked so as not to be viewed from the outside.<br>
[56]	<br>
With the arrangement of the control element board 84 is arranged downwardly of the light-emitting diode board 82, and covering the lower portion of the lens 88 with the mud guard cover 47, by masking the control element board 84 so as not to be viewed from the outside, the control element board 84 can be hidden from the eye when viewed from the outside, and can be protected from the outside.<br>
[57]	<br>
For example, the number of components can be reduced in comparison with the case in which the control element board is masked using an additional part. Alternatively, the existing part can be used conveniently, and the application of the existing part (mud guard cover 47) can be increased.<br>
[58]	<br>
By inclining the light-emitting diode board 82 and the control element board 84 along the inner fender 64, and arranging the same not in the same level (arranged in two steps by differentiating the depth), a vacant space can be effectively used, and accordingly, the tail lamp 46 can be formed compactly. Consequently, the layout of the tail lamp 46 is facilitated.<br>
It is also referable to be such that the light-emitting diode board 82 is arranged not in the same level as the control element board 84, and the control element board 84 is arranged downwardly of the light-emitting diode board.<br><br>
The tail lamp structure 60 is referable to be such that the upper portion of the lens 88 (upper cover portion 111) is covered by the rear fender 43 and, by covering the upper portion of the lens 88 with the rear fender 43, light entering the tail lamp 46 from the outside can be blocked. Consequently, the tail lamp for a vehicle with a good visibility can be realized.<br>
In the drawing, reference numeral 118 designates a mounting screw for tightening the inner lens (diffuser panel) 85 and the light-shielding panel 86 together, and reference numeral 119 designates a mounting screw for mounting the inner fender 64 to the housing 87.<br>
[60]	<br>
By providing the inner lens 85 is provided between the light emitting diodes 81... and the lens 88, and providing the control element board 84 rearwardly of the inner lens 85 with respect to the vehicle body, the depth of the tail lamp 46 can be reduced. Also, the improvement of the maintenanceability of the tail lamp 46 is achieved.<br>
[0061]<br>
Furthermore, by providing the light-shielding panel 86 between the inner lens 85 and the control element board 84, light leaked on the side of the control element board 84 can be blocked, and the designing property can be improved. Then, since the light-shielding panel 86 is provided integrally with the inner lens 85 (integrally mounted, or fastened with the mounting screw 118 together), the assembleability can be improved.<br>
[0062]<br>
While the tail lamp structure for a vehicle according to the present invention is applied to the motorcycle as the vehicle as shown in Fig. 4, it is not limited thereto, and the vehicle may be two-wheelers, three-wheelers, or four-wheelers.<br>
While the tail lamp structure for a vehicle according to the present invention includes the license lamp 44 on the welled portion as shown in Fig. 2, it is not limited thereto, and the number plate mounting portion may be provided on the swelled portion.<br>
