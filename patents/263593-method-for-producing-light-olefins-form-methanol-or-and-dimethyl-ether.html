				<td>Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method for converting methanol or/and dimethyl ether into light olefins.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Light olefins such as ethylene, propylene, etc. are the basic raw material for chemical industry. Conventionally, ethylene and propylene mainly come from steam cracking of hydrocarbon feedstock such as naphtha, light diesel oil, hydrogenation cracking tail oil and the like. Recently, as the price of crude oil has been dramatically rising up, the cost for producing ethylene and propylene from the above feedstock has been increasing. Also, in the conventional processes for producing ethylene and propylene, high temperature tubular furnace cracking technologies with a high energy consumption are generally used. All these factors urge the development of new olefin production technologies. Novel technical pathways of preparation of lower olefins from non-petroleum materials have caught much attention in the past years. Among those, the one, characterized in that coal or natural gas is transformed into methanol through syngas, and then methanol is transformed into lower olefins, has been of extensive interest. The process of selectively producing light olefins from methanol (or dimethyl ether generated from the dehydration of methanol) in the presence of molecular sieve catalysts is referred to as MTO process. The methods and technologies for transforming methanol into light olefins are closely correlated to the catalysts used therein. It is well known that two classes of catalysts are used in these processes. One class is the catalysts based on ZSM-5 molecular sieves with medium size micropores, characterized by higher yield of propylene and lower yield of ethylene in the distribution of the products, slightly lower total yield of ethylene and propylene, strong anti-coking ability of the catalysts and longer operating cycle. The reaction techniques suitable for the above class are usually fixed bed reaction techniques with periodical<br><br>
switches between reactions and regenerations. Another class of catalysts is based on the molecular sieves with smaller pore size, characterized by high total yield of ethylene and propylene as well as higher yield of ethylene in the product. Because this class of catalysts has a higher coking rate, the processes generally utilize fluidized bed techniques with continuous reaction-regeneration of the catalysts.<br>

With the technologies and methods disclosed above, the distributions of products are relatively fixed. Although the composition of products could be modulated by altering the reaction conditions in some of these patented methods, the extent of the modulation is much limited. The changing demand for olefins in the global market, particularly the rapidly increasing demand for propylene in the recent years, requires a more flexible distribution of the olefin products transformed from methanol, especially in the ratio of ethylene to propylene, i.e. the two main olefin products. In view of above, several patents have disclosed the methods for changing the distribution of products by recycling a portion of the products.<br>
US patent US6441262 B1 and Chinese patent CN1489563A disclose methods for transforming oxygenate feedstock into lower olefins, wherein methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, 1-butanol or mixture thereof is contacted with the catalyst to generate olefins, and then the catalyst is contacted with said oxygenate compounds to generate olefins, so that the ratio of products, including ethylene, propylene and butylene, could be changed without shutdown.<br>

Reactors connected in series are utilized to produce propylene, dimethyl ether and higher hydrocarbon, and the resultant dimethyl ether and a portion of the higher hydrocarbons are returned back into the reactors connected in series and subjected to a further reaction, in order to increase the yield of propylene.<br>
US patents US5914438 and US6303839 B1 disclose methods for producing lower olefins, including   that   oxygenate   feedstock   are   contacted   with   the   catalyst   containing<br><br>
aluminophosphate and transformed into C2-C4 olefin, and partial C3 and C4 fraction are recycled and cracked to increase the yield of ethylene and propylene. The recycling reaction could be carried out in the riser of the fluidized bed or in a separate reaction zone.<br>
US patent US5990369 disclosed a method for producing lower olefins, including that oxygenate feedstock are contacted with a catalyst containing aluminophosphate and transformed into C2-C4 olefins, and a portion of the olefin products are recycled and cracked to increase the yield of ethylene, propylene and butylenes, wherein either propylene could be recycled to increase production of ethylene, or the ethylene and butylenes could be recycled to increase production of propylene.<br>
The present invention is based on the theory that during the transformation from methanol to olefins, there exist several reaction trends: Certain reaction trends can be enforced by employing different reaction conditions in different reaction zones, so that the composition of the products can be changed. The commonly well known transformation route from methanol to hydrocarbons under acidic catalysts is shown as follows:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
It is a complicated reaction network, roughly including two reaction directions: one is the reactions involving the increase of the number of carbon atoms- light olefins such as ethylene, propylene and the like forms higher hydrocarbon molecules through reactions such as oligomenzation and the like; the other one is the reactions involving the reduce of number of carbon atoms- higher hydrocarbon molecules are cracked into light olefin such as ethylene and propylene, etc. In order to obtain lower olefins such as ethylene and propylene, certain reaction conditions such as higher reaction temperature which favors the transformation towards the cracking of higher hydrocarbon are usually required. Another<br><br>
pathway is to utilize the shape selectivity of molecular sieve catalysts to ensure that the reactions occur in the channels so that only the smaller hydrocarbon molecules may diffuse out and lower olefins are formed at a high selectivity. Recently, it has been found in some studies that the reaction types involved in the MTO transformation procedure are more complicated than the above scheme. For instance, Svelle et al has discovered in an isotope research (Kinetic studies of zeolite-catalyzed methylation reactions. J. Catat., 224 (1), 115-123, 2004) that during the transformation from methanol to olefin, alkylation occurs between olefins and methanol, so that the number of carbon atoms in olefin is increased:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
In particular, the alkylation between one molecule of ethylene and one molecule of methanol forms one molecule of propylene.<br>
US patent US3906054 discloses a technology for alkylation of olefins, comprising that olefins are contacted with catalysts, i.e. a zeolite with silica to alumina ratio of 12 or higher, in the presence of alkylating agents. P modification is used, wherein the minimum P content is 0.78 wt %. The olefins that may be alkylated include ethylene, propylene, butylene-2 and isobutylene, and the suitable alkylating agents are methanol, dimethyl ether and methyl chloride.<br>
The international patent WO2005/056504 A1 discloses a method for efficiently preparing propylene from ethylene and methanol or/and dimethyl ether, including that ethylene and methanol or/and dimethyl ether react in the presence of catalysts to generate propylene. It is characterized in that the amount of ethylene flowing out of the reaction system is reduced as compared with the amount of ethylene added to the reaction system. The yield of propylene reaches 40 mol % based on the moles of methanol or two times of the moles of dimethyl ether which is added to the reaction system.<br>
Disclosure of the invention<br><br>
The present invention provides a method for converting methanol or/and dimethyl ether into light olefins, whereby the selectivity of lower olefins is improved in the whole process and the ratio of ethylene/propylene of the product is modulated, comprising feeding methanol or/and dimethyl ether at three reaction zones and strengthening the following two reaction trends, wherein one is to strengthen the cracking of higher olefins to increase the total yield of ethylene and propylene; and the other is to strengthen the alkylation of ethylene and methanol or/and dimethyl ether to co-transform a portion of ethylene and methanol or/and dimethyl ether into propylene.<br>
The present invention provides a method for transforming methanol or/and dimethyl ether into light olefins, characterized in that at least 3 independent reaction zones and at least one separation zone are employed. The feedstock of methanol or/and dimethyl ether is divided into 3 streams. The first stream enters the first reaction zone, being contacted with a molecular sieve catalyst and transformed into a mixture of ethylene, propylene, butylenes and higher hydrocarbons. The catalyst used in such reaction zone can be a silica-alumina zeolite or/and a silicophosphate molecular sieve, with a pore size of 0.3-0.6 nm, such as ZSM-5, ZSM-11, SAPO-34, SAPO-11, etc., and their derivatives obtained by elemental modification. The contact of the feedstock (i.e. methanol or/and dimethyl ether) with the catalyst is performed in reactors such as fixed beds, fluidized beds or risers, etc. In the case of fixed bed reactors, a series of reactors in this reaction zone are set for alternative switches to regeneration state. In the case of fluidized bed and riser reactors, the devices for continuous catalyst regeneration are included. The reaction conditions should ensure a conversion of methanol or/and dimethyl ether higher than 99%, a sufficiently high yield of ethylene and propylene, and an as low as possible yield of low-value products such as methane and coke. The suitable reaction temperature in said reaction zone is 350-700°C.<br>
The stream flowing out of the reaction zone described above enters into said separation zone to undergo a preliminary separation. The streams flowing out of the other two reaction zones enter into said separation zone as well. Three effluent streams are formed from said<br><br>
separation zone, including a stream containing ethylene, ethane, and lighter fractions; a stream containing propylene and propane; and a stream containing C4 and heavier fractions. Among them, the stream containing propylene and propane fractions undergoes a further separation to remove propane and form a propylene product At least a portion of the stream containing ethylene, ethane and lighter products enters the second reaction zone, and the rest are led to a further separation to remove other fractions to form ethylene product At least a portion of the stream containing C4 and heavier fractions enters the third reaction zone, and the rest part forms a mixed hydrocarbon product with carbon atoms of 4 and more, or forms C4 product, C5 product and the like by further separation.<br>
The second stream of methanol or/and dimethyl ether enters the second reaction zone. At the same time, at least a portion of said stream containing ethylene, ethane and lighter products which comprise C2H4, C2H6, CH4, H2 and COx(x=1 or 2), etc., coming from the separation zone, enters into the same reaction zone. After sufficiently mixed, these two streams are contacted with a molecular sieve catalyst, so that a mixed stream containing propylene are generated and in turn fed into the separation zone. The catalysts used in this reaction zone can be a silica-alumina zeolite, a silicophosphate molecular sieve, with a pore size of 0.3-0.6 nm, such as ZSM-5, ZSM-11, SAPO-34, SAPO-11, etc., or their derivatives obtained by elemental modification. The reaction conditions should ensure that the conversion of methanol or/and dimethyl ether is greater than 99% and that the propylene is generated at high selectivity. The suitable reaction temperature in such reaction zone is 250-600°C. The contact between the feedstock mixture and the catalyst can be performed in various kinds of reactors including fixed beds, fluidized beds and risers, etc. In the case of fixed bed reactors, a series of reactors are included in this reaction zone for alternative switches to regeneration state. In the case of fluidized bed and riser reactors, the devices for continuous regeneration catalysts are included.<br>
The third stream of methanol or/and dimethyl ether enters the third reaction zone. At the same time, at least a portion of the stream containing C4 and heavier fractions, coming from the separation zone, enters into the same reaction zone. This stream containing C4 and<br><br>
heavier fractions are contacted with a catalyst in the third reaction zone and cracked to form a mixed product comprising ediylene and propylene. The cracking reaction is endothermic, and the reaction heat is at least partially provided by the transformation of the feedstock of methanol or/and dimethyl ether which is introduced into said reaction zone, in the presence<br>
of a catalyst. Methanol or/and dimethyl ether contacts the catalyst either together with said stream containing C4 and heavier fractions, or at different sections in the same reaction zone and indirectly provide the heat for the cracking reaction of the latter. Meanwhile, the contacting of methanol or/and dimethyl ether with the catalyst generates products including ethylene, propylene and C4 and heavier fractions. The catalysts used in such reaction zone can be a silica-alumina zeolite or a silicophosphate molecular sieve, with a pore size of 0.3-0.6 nm, such as ZSM-5, ZSM-11, SAPO-34, SAPO-11, etc., and/or their derivatives obtained by element modification. The reaction conditions should ensure that the conversion of methanol or/and dimethyl ether is greater than 99% and that the ethylene and propylene are generated at high selectivity. The suitable reaction temperature in said reaction zone is 450-700°C. The contact between the material streams and the catalyst can be done in all kinds of reactors including fixed beds, fluidized beds and risers, etc. The stream flowing out of the reactor contains ethylene, propylene and C4 and heavier fractions and enters into the separation zone described above.<br>
In the above method, a portion of the stream containing ethylene, ethane and lighter products, coming from said separation zone, enters the second reaction zone, and a portion of the stream containing C4 and heavier fractions, coming from said separation zone, enters the third reaction zone, at certain proportions, respectively. These two proportions change from 1% to 99% by weight. The stream of methanol or/and dimethyl ether that enters into the second reaction zone accounts for 1-30 % of the total stream of methanol or/and dimethyl ether by weight. The stream of methanol or/and dimethyl ether that enters into the third reaction zone accounts for 1-40 % of the total stream of methanol or/and dimethyl ether by weight. In the distribution of the final olefin products, the ethylene/propylene ratio is 0-2.0 (by weight).<br><br>
Based on the above disclosure of the invention, the present invention can be summarized as follow:<br>
The present invention provides a method for converting methanol or/and dimethyl ether into light olefins, characterized in that at least three independent reaction zones and at least one separation zone are employed, and that all feedstock of methanol or/and dimethyl ether are divided into three parts and fed at said independent reaction zones, and that the ratio of different types of olefins in the final product can be modulated by changing the feeding ratio for each reaction zone, the method comprising the steps of: (a) converting methanol or/and dimethyl ether into a mixed hydrocarbon stream that contains ethylene, propylene and olefin with 4 and more carbon atoms in the presence of acidic catalysts in the first reaction zone, and leading said hydrocarbon stream into said separation zone; (b) carrying out the separation of all the effluent streams of said three reaction zones in said separation zone to form a C3 fraction which flows out of said separation zone to form a propylene product by further separation, a fraction with no more than 2 carbon atoms and a fraction with 4 or more carbon atoms, at least a portion of said effluent stream with no more than 2 carbon atoms being led into the second reaction zone with the rest being further separated to obtain ethylene product, at least a portion of said effluent stream with 4 or more carbon atoms being led into the third reaction zone with the rest being further separated to obtain butylene product; (c) contacting the methanol or/and dimethyl ether together with at least a portion of effluent stream coming from said separation zone and containing no more than 2 carbon atoms with an acidic catalyst in the second reaction zone and leading the formed mixture containing propylene into said separation zone; (d) contacting methanol or/and dimethyl ether as well as at least a portion of said effluent stream coming from said separation zone and containing 4 or more carbon atoms with an acidic catalyst in the third reaction zone, and leading the resultant mixture containing certain concentration of ethylene and propylene into said separation zone.<br>
According to the above method, the stream of methanol or/and dimethyl ether that enter(s) the second reaction zone accounts for 1-30 wt % of the total stream of methanol or/and<br><br>
dimethyl ether. The stream of methanol or/and dimethyl ether that enter(s) the third reaction zone accounts for 1-40 wt % of the total stream of methanol or/and dimethyl ether. 1-99 wt% of the stream flowing out of the separation zone and containing 2 or fewer carbon atoms enters the second reaction zone. 1-99 wt% of the stream flowing out of the separation zone and containing 4 or fewer carbon atoms enters the third reaction zone.<br>
According to the above method, the catalysts used in each reaction zone may include a silica-alumina zeolite or/and a silicophosphate molecular sieve, and their derivatives obtained by elemental modification. The pore sizes for the silica-alumina zeolite or/and silicophosphate molecular sieve are 0.3-0.6 nm. The catalysts include matrix materials comprising one or more of silica, alumina or clay.<br>
According to the method of the present invention, the reaction temperature in the first reaction zone is 350-7OO°C; the reaction temperature in the second reaction zone is 250-600°C; and the reaction temperature in the third reaction zone is 450-700°C.<br>
According to the method of the present invention, fluidized beds, fixed beds or moving bed reactors can be utilized in the first, second and third reaction zone, respectively.<br>

Figure 1 is the schematic flow chart of the method according to the present invention. As shown in figure 1, all the feedstock of methanol or/and dimethyl ether is divided into 3 streams. The stream 8 of methanol of/and dimethyl ether enters into the reaction zone 1, and is transformed into a mixed stream 11 containing ethylene, propylene, butylenes and hydrocarbon with more carbon atoms. The mixed stream 11 then enters into the separation zone 4 and undergoes a preliminary separation. The stream 12 flowing out of the reaction zone 2 and the stream 13 flowing out of the reaction zone 3 enter into the separation zone 4 as well. Three effluent streams are formed from the separation zone 4, including the stream containing ethylene, ethane and lighter fractions; the stream containing propylene and<br><br>
propane; and the stream containing C4 and heavier fractions. Among them, the stream 16 containing propylene and propane undergoes a separation step in the separation zone 5, so that propane is removed and the propylene product 19 is generated. At least a portion of the stream containing ethylene, ethane and lighter products (stream 14) enters into the reaction zone 2, with the rest (stream 17) entering into the separation zone 6 and going through a separation step to remove fractions other than ethylene to form the ethylene product 20. At least a portion of the stream containing C4 and heavier fractions (stream IS) enters into the reaction zone 3, with the rest forming a mixed hydrocarbon product with 4 or more carbon atoms (stream 18) or undergoing a separation step in the separation zone 7 to form products as C4 product (stream 21) and products with S or more carbon atoms. The stream 9 of methanol or/and dimethyl ether enters into the reaction zone 2. At the same time, the stream 14 flowing out of the separation zone 4 and containing ethylene, ethane and lighter products enters into the same reaction zone, and the stream 12 flowing out of the reaction zone 2 and containing propylene enters into the separation zone 4. The stream 10 of methanol or/and dimethyl ether enters into the reaction zone 3. At the same time, a portion of stream flowing out of separation zone 4 and containing C4 and heavier fractions (stream 15) enters into the same reaction zone, and the stream 13 flowing out of the reaction zone 3 and containing ethylene, propylene and hydrocarbons with 4 and more carbon atoms enters into the separation zone 4.<br>
