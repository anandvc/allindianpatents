				<td>PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF (3-CYANO-1H-INDOL-7-YL) (4-(4-FLUOROPHENETHYL)<br>
PIPERAZIN-1-YL)-METHANONE AND SALTS THEREOF<br>
The invention relates to a process for the preparation of (3-cyano-1H-indol-<br>
7-yl)[4-(4-fluorophenethyl)piperazin-1-yl]methanone of the formula I,<br>
and salts thereof, and of intermediates in the synthesis.<br>
The compound (3-cyano-1H-indol-7-yl)[4-(4-fluorophenethyl)piperazin-<br>
1-yl]methanone and the corresponding physiologically acceptable salts<br>
surprisingly have selective affinity to 5-HT2A receptors. In particular, they<br>
are selective 5-HT2A antagonists.<br>
5-HT2A antagonists exhibit clinically antipsychotic activity with no or minimal<br>
side effects and are correspondingly regarded as antipsychotics having few<br>
side effects. In addition, they can be used in the treatment of neurological<br>
disorders attributable to disturbances in serotonergic transmission, such as<br>
depression, anxiety states, panic illnesses, obsessive-compulsive<br>
disorders, pain, sleep disturbances, sleeplessness, eating disorders, such<br>
as anorexia nervosa, bulimia, addiction behaviour, dependence on certain<br>
addiction-causing substances, such as LSD and MDMA, cardiovascular<br>
disorders, such as various angina diseases, Raynaud"s syndrome,<br>
intermittent claudication, cardiac or peripheral vascular spasms,<br>
fibromyalgia, cardiac arrhythmia and thrombotic illnesses, since the sub-<br>
stances inhibit platelet aggregation. In combination with classical or atypical<br>
neuroleptics, the side effects induced by the neuroleptics can be sup-<br>
pressed. Owing to the reduction in ocular pressure, the substances can<br>
also be employed in glaucoma therapy. Toxic symptoms caused by poison-<br>
ing with, for example, ergovalin, can be suppressed using the substances.<br>
The compounds can therefore be used as medicament active ingredients in<br>
human and veterinary medicine. They can furthermore be used as interme-<br>
diates for the preparation of further medicament active ingredients.<br>
Since (3-cyano-1H-indol-7-yl)[4-(4-fluorophenethyl)piperazin-1 -yl]metha-<br>
none and salts thereof are very highly promising as medicaments, the<br>
preparation is of extremely high interest.<br>
The object of the present invention was therefore to find a novel and effect-<br>
ive synthesis variant for the 5-HT2A receptor antagonists.<br>
The invention therefore relates to a process for the preparation of (3-cyano-<br>
1H-indol-7-yl)[4-(4-fluorophenethyl)piperazin-1-yl]methanone of the formula<br>
I,<br>
and salts thereof, characterised in that<br>
(1) an indole ester of the formula II<br>
in which<br>
R is an alkyl group having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms or arylalkyl,<br>
is formylated,<br>
(2) the formyl ester of the formula III<br>
in which R is as defined above,<br>
formed from (1) is reacted with hydroxylamine to give an oxime derivative<br>
of the formula IV<br>
in which R is as defined above,<br>
(3) the oxime of the formula IV is converted into a cyanoindole ester of the<br>
formula V<br>
in which R has one of the meanings indicated above,<br>
(4) the ester of the formula V is saponified to give 3-cyano-1H-indole-<br>
7-carboxylic acid,<br>
(5) the 3-cyano-1H-indole-7-carboxylic acid is reacted with 1-[2-(4-fluoro-<br>
phenyl)ethyl]piperazine or salts thereof to give the compound of the<br>
formula I, and<br>
(6) the resultant base of the formula I is converted into one of its salts by<br>
treatment with an acid.<br>
The substituent R in the formulae II to VI is an alkyl group having from 1 to<br>
6 carbon atoms or an arylalkyl group.<br>
The alkyl group preferably has 1, 2, 3 or 4 carbon atoms and is therefore,<br>
for example, methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, sec-butyl or tert-<br>
butyl, furthermore also pentyl, 1-, 2- or 3-methylbutyl, 1,1-, 1,2- or 2,2-<br>
dimethylpropyl, 1-ethylpropyl, hexyl, 1-, 2-, 3- or 4-methylpentyl, 1,1-, 1,2-,<br>
1,3-, 2,2-, 2,3- or 3,3-dimethylbutyl, 1- or 2-ethylbutyl, 1 -ethyl-1-methyl-<br>
propyl, 1-ethyl-2-methylpropyl, 1,1,2-or 1,2,2-trimethylpropyl, furthermore<br>
trifluoromethyl or pentafluoroethyl.<br>
Arylalkyl is alternatively -(CH2)0-Ar, where Ar is preferably phenyl or<br>
naphthyl, and o can be 0, 1 or 2. Arylalkyl is, in particular, benzyl, phenyl-<br>
ethyl or naphthylmethyl, particularly preferably benzyl.<br>
R is preferably methyl or ethyl, particularly preferably ethyl.<br>
The indole esters of the formula II are commercially available or can be<br>
prepared by known synthetic methods. The preparation can, for example,<br>
be carried out starting from 3-methyl-2-nitrobenzoic acid, which is com-<br>
mercially available, by the following reactions:<br>
(1) esterification of 3-methyl-2-nitrobenzoic acid,<br>
(2) reaction with an N,N-dimethylformamide acetal to give a 3-(2-<br>
dimethylaminovinyl)-2-nitrobenzoic acid ester, and<br>
(3) subsequent palladium-catalysed ring closure reaction to give the<br>
indole ester of the formula II.<br>
Suitable indole esters of the formula II are, in particular, methyl 1H-indole-<br>
7-carboxylate, ethyl 1H-indole-7-carboxylate, tert-butyl 1H-indole-<br>
7-carboxylate and benzyl 1H-indole-7-carboxylate. The synthesis according<br>
to the invention is particularly preferably carried out using ethyl 1H-indole-7-<br>
carboxylate.<br>
Suitable N,N-dimethylformamide acetals are, for example, N,N-dimethyl-<br>
formamide bis[2-(trimethylsilyl)ethyl] acetal, N,N-dimethylformamide<br>
dibenzyl acetal, N.N-dimethylformamide dibutyl acetal, N,N-dimethylform-<br>
amide di-tert-butyl acetal, N.N-dimethylforrnamide diethyl acetal, N,N-<br>
dimethylformamide diisopropyl acetal, N.N-dimethylformamide dimethyl<br>
acetal, N.N-dimethylformamide dineopentyl acetal, N.N-dimethylformamide<br>
dipropyl acetal and N.N-dimethylformamide ethylene acetal.<br>
Particular preference is given to N.N-dimethylformamide diethyl acetal and<br>
N,N-dimethylformamide dimethyl acetal.<br>
The palladium-catalysed cyclisation reaction is carried out analogously to<br>
the method of Leimgruber-Batcho [Clark R.D. et al, Heterocycles, 1984, 22,<br>
195-221, Batcho D. et al, Organic Synthesis, 1985, 63, 214-225].<br>
The reaction conditions selected are known from the literature. However, it<br>
is also possible to use other processes known from the literature, which are<br>
not explained in greater detail here, for the preparation of compounds of<br>
the formula II (lit.: Houben-Weyl, Methoden der Organ. Chemie [Methods of<br>
Organic Chemistry], Georg-Thieme-Verlag, Stuttgart).<br>
The formylation of a compound of the formula II to give a formyl ester of<br>
the formula III, in which R has one of the meanings indicated above, is<br>
carried out analogously to the method of Vilsmeyer-Haack [Jutz C. et al.,<br>
Iminium Salts in Organic Chemistry Part I, New York, John Wiley &amp; Sons<br>
Inc., 1976, pp. 234 ff, pp. 237 ff]. The reaction is preferably carried out in<br>
an aprotic polar solvent and at reaction temperatures between 0° and 50°<br>
and with heating to from 100° to 130°C. Particularly preferred solvents are<br>
dimethylformamide (DMF) and mixtures of DMF with aromatic<br>
hydrocarbons, such as benzene, toluene or xylene, or with further amides,<br>
such as N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP).<br>
The formylation is particularly preferably carried out in DMF in the presence<br>
of POCI3.<br>
Suitable formylindole esters of the formula III are, in particular, 7-methoxy-<br>
carbonyl-3-indolecarboxaldehyde, 7-ethoxycarbonyl-3-indolecarbox-<br>
aldehyde, 7-tert-butoxycarbonyl-3-indolecarboxaldehyde and 7-benzyloxy-<br>
carbonyl-3-indolecarboxaldehyde. The synthesis according to the invention<br>
is particularly preferably carried out using 7-ethoxycarbonyl-3-indole-<br>
carboxaldehyde.<br>
The oximation of the compounds of the formula III, as described above, is<br>
carried out under standard conditions (lit.: Kurtz P., Houben-Weyl,<br>
Methoden der Organ. Chemie [Methods of Organic Chemistry], Vol. VIII,<br>
Georg-Thieme-Verlag, Stuttgart).<br>
The oximation is particularly preferably carried out in polar aprotic solvents,<br>
such as DMF, benzene, toluene, xylene or NMP, at temperatures between<br>
0° and 50°, in particular at room temperature.<br>
The preparation of the cyanoindole esters of the formula V, as described<br>
above, is carried out by treatment with acid. Suitable acids are, for<br>
example, inorganic acids, such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid or phos-<br>
phoric acid, or organic acids, such as formic acid, acetic acid, p-toluene-<br>
sulfonic acid or methanesulfonic acid. The reaction is particularly preferably<br>
carried out in high-boiling aprotic solvents, such as DMF or NMP, or<br>
mixtures thereof with aprotic solvents, at temperatures between 20° and<br>
100°, in particular at 50°C.<br>
In a particular embodiment of the process, steps (1) to (3) are carried out in<br>
situ, i.e. in a one-pot process analogously to Liebscher J. et al, Z. Chem.<br>
1983, 23, 214-215, without the intermediates being isolated. The one-pot<br>
process gives better yields compared with the stepwise synthesis.<br>
The saponification of the compounds of the formula V to give 3-cyano-1H-<br>
indole-7-carboxylic acid is carried out under standard conditions (lit.:<br>
Houben-Weyl, Methoden der Organ. Chemie [Methods of Organic<br>
Chemistry], Georg-Thieme-Verlag, Stuttgart).<br>
The saponification is particularly preferably carried out using KOH in<br>
methanol at room temperature.<br>
As an alternative to chemical saponification, the ester cleavage can also be<br>
carried out enzymatically with the aid of esterases. Suitable esterases are,<br>
for example, Bacillus sp. esterase, Bacillus stearothermophilus esterase,<br>
Candida lipolytica esterase, Mucor miehei esterase, horse liver esterase,<br>
Saccaromyces cerevisiae esterase, pig"s liver esterase,<br>
Thermoanaerobium brockii esterase and pig"s liver esterase isoenzyme 1.<br>
The esterases may also be employed in immobilised form. Commercial<br>
immobilised esterases are, for example, pig"s liver esterase (PLE)<br>
immobilised on Eupergit® C or on oxirane-acrylic beads.<br>
Enzymatic reactions are preferably carried out in aqueous buffer systems,<br>
but other solvents, in particular alcohols, such as ethanol, may also be<br>
present.<br>
The reaction of 3-cyano-1 H-indole-7-carboxylic acid with 1-[2-(4-fluoro-<br>
phenyl)ethyl]piperazine or one of the salts, in particular, with 1-[2-(4-fluoro-<br>
phenyl)ethyl]piperazine dihydrochloride, is carried out by methods as are<br>
known from the literature for the acylation of amines [Houben-Weyl, I.c.,<br>
Volume 15/11, pages 1 to 806 (1974)]. However, it is also possible to react<br>
the compounds in the presence of an inert solvent. Examples of suitable<br>
solvents are hydrocarbons, such as benzene, toluene and xylene; ketones,<br>
such as acetone and butanone; alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol, iso-<br>
propanol and n-butanol; ethers, such as tetrahydrofuran (THF) and diox-<br>
ane; amides, such as dimethylformamide (DMF) or N-methylpyrrolidone;<br>
nitriles, such as acetonitrile, if desired also mixtures of these solvents with<br>
one another or mixtures with water. The addition of an acid-binding agent,<br>
for example an alkali or alkaline earth metal hydroxide, carbonate or<br>
bicarbonate or of another salt of a weak acid of the alkali or alkaline earth<br>
metals, preferably of potassium, sodium or calcium, or the addition of an<br>
organic base, such as triethylamine, dimethylaniline, pyridine or quinoline,<br>
or of an excess of a piperazine derivative, may be favourable. Depending<br>
on the conditions used, the reaction temperature is between about 0° and<br>
150°, normally between 20° and 130°.<br>
Instead of the 3-cyano-1H-indole-7-carboxylic acid, it is also possible to<br>
employ derivatives of this acid, preferably the preactivated carboxylic acid,<br>
or a corresponding carboxylic acid halide, a symmetrical or mixed<br>
anhydride or an active ester of 3-cyano-1H-indole-7-carboxylic acid.<br>
Radicals of this type for activation of the carboxyl group in typical acylation<br>
reactions are described in the literature (for example in the standard works,<br>
such as Houben-Weyl, Methoden der organischen Chemie [Methods of<br>
Organic Chemistry], Georg-Thieme-Verlag, Stuttgart).<br>
Activated esters are advantageously formed in situ, for example by addition<br>
of HOBt or N-hydroxysuccinimide.<br>
The compound 1-[2-(4-fluorophenyl)ethyl]piperazine and salts thereof are<br>
known and can be prepared by conventional processes which are known to<br>
the person skilled in the art. A description of the preparation is disclosed,<br>
for example, in DE 2855703.<br>
A resultant base of the formula I can be converted into the associated acid-<br>
addition salt using an acid. Suitable acids for this reaction are those which<br>
give physiologically acceptable salts. Thus, it is possible to use inorganic<br>
acids, for example sulfuric acid, hydrohalic acids, such as hydrochloric acid<br>
or hydrobromic acid, phosphoric acids, such as orthophosphoric acid, nitric<br>
acid or sulfamic acid, furthermore organic acids, in detail aliphatic, alicyclic,<br>
araliphatic, aromatic or heterocyclic monobasic or polybasic carboxylic,<br>
sulfonic or sulfuric acids, such as formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid,<br>
pivalic acid, diethylacetic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, pimelic acid,<br>
fumaric acid, maleic acid, lactic acid, tartaric acid, malic acid, benzoic acid,<br>
salicylic acid, 2-phenylpropionic acid, citric acid, gluconic acid, ascorbic<br>
acid, nicotinic acid, isonicotinic acid, methane- or ethanesulfonic acid,<br>
ethanedisulfonic acid, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid,<br>
p-toluenesulfonic acid, naphthalenemono- and -disulfonic acids and<br>
laurylsulfuric acid.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the salt formation is carried out in a solvent<br>
mixture of acetone/water in a ratio of between 5:1 and 4:1 by precipitation<br>
using hydrochloric acid (37%). (3-Cyano-1H-indol-7-yl)[4-(4-fIuorophen-<br>
ethyl)piperazin-1-yl]methanone, hydrochloride, is formed.<br>
In a further embodiment of the process according to the invention, the<br>
cyanoindole ester of the formula V can be reacted directly, without prior<br>
saponification to 3-cyano-1H-indole-7-carboxylic acid, with 1-[2-(4-fluoro-<br>
phenyl)ethyl]piperazine or a corresponding salt by chemical or biochemical<br>
aminolysis.<br>
The chemical aminolysis can be carried out, for example, by the method of<br>
Menger F. M. et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1969, 91, 5346-9.<br>
The biochemical aminolysis can be carried out, for example, by reaction of<br>
a compound of the formula V with 1-[2-(4-fluorophenyl)ethyl]piperazine or<br>
one of the corresponding salts in the presence of a lipase or an antibody.<br>
The biochemical aminolysis can be carried out, for example, by the method<br>
of Gotor V. et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1999, 7, 2189-2197.<br>
The invention therefore likewise relates to a process for the preparation of<br>
(3-cyano-1 H-indol-7-yl)[4-(4-fluorophenethyl)piperazin-1 -yl]methanone of<br>
the formula I<br>
and salts thereof, characterised in that<br>
(1) an indole ester of the formula II<br>
in which<br>
R is an alkyl group having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms or arylalkyl,<br>
isformylated,<br>
(2) the formyl ester of the formula III<br>
in which R is as defined above,<br>
formed from (1) is reacted with hydroxylamine to give an oxime derivative<br>
of the formula IV<br>
in which R is as defined above,<br>
(3) the oxime of the formula IV is converted into a cyanoindole ester of the<br>
formula V<br>
in which R has one of the meanings indicated above,<br>
(4) the ester of the formula V is converted into the compound of the formula<br>
I by aminolysis using 1-[2-(4-fluorophenyl)ethyl]piperazine or one of the<br>
salts, and<br>
(5) the resultant base of the formula I is converted into one of its salts by<br>
treatment with an acid.<br>
In a further embodiment of the process according to the invention, the<br>
compound 3-cyano-1 H-indole-7-carboxylic acid can be prepared by<br>
halogenation of an indole ester of the formula II<br>
as described above to give a compound of the formula VI<br>
in which R is an alkyl group having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms or arylalkyl<br>
and<br>
Hal is CI, Br or l,<br>
followed by cyanation.<br>
The halogenation of the compounds of the formula II, as described above,<br>
is carried out under standard conditions (lit.: Houben-Weyl, Methoden der<br>
Organ. Chemie [Methods of Organic Chemistry], Georg-Thieme-Verlag,<br>
Stuttgart) or analogously to Heterocycles, 1986, 24. 2879-85, ibid. 1989,<br>
29,1663-7; J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985, 107, 2943-5; J. Org. Chem. 1993, 58,<br>
2058-60, or J. Chem. Soc, Perkin Trans. 1, 1989, 2009-15.<br>
The bromination or iodination in the 3-position of the indole can likewise be<br>
carried out analogously to Bocchi et al. Synthesis 1982, 1096-1097.<br>
Examples of suitable solvents for the halogenation are hydrocarbons, such<br>
as benzene, toluene and xylene; halogenated hydrocarbons, such as<br>
dichloromethane and chloroform; ketones, such as acetone and butanone;<br>
alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol and n-butanol; ethers,<br>
such as tetrahydrofuran (THF) and dioxane; amides, such as dimethyl-<br>
formamide (DMF) and N-methylpyrrolidone; nitriles, such as acetonitrile,<br>
and if desired mixtures of these solvents with one another.<br>
Compounds prepared in accordance with the invention by halogenation<br>
are, for example, methyl 3-chloro-1H-indole-7-carboxylate, methyl 3-bromo-<br>
1H-indole-7-carboxylate, methyl 3-iodo-1H-indole-7-carboxylate, ethyl 3-<br>
chloro-1H-indole-7-carboxylate, ethyl 3-bromo-1H-indole-7-carboxylate,<br>
ethyl 3-iodo-1H-indole-7-carboxylate, tert-butyl 3-chloro-1H-indo!e-7-<br>
carboxylate, tert-butyl 3-bromo-1H-indole-7-carboxylate, tert-butyl 3-iodo-<br>
1H-indole-7-carboxylate, benzyl 3-chloro-1H-indole-7-carboxylate, benzyl 3-<br>
bromo-1H-indole-7-carboxylate and benzyl 3-iodo-1H-indole-7-carboxylate.<br>
The use of ethyl 3-bromo-1H-indole-7-carboxylate or ethyl 3-iodo-1H-<br>
indole-7-carboxylate is particularly suitable in accordance with the<br>
invention.<br>
The substitution of the halogen group of the compounds of the formula VI<br>
by the cyano group is carried out analogously to the method of Cassar L. et<br>
al., Adv. Chem. Ser. 1974, 132, 252-73, with nickel catalysis or analogously<br>
to the method of Sakamoto T. et al, J. Chem. Soc, Perkin Trans. 1 1999,<br>
16, 2323-2326, or Chatani N. et al, J. Org. Chem. 1986, 51, 4714-16, with<br>
palladium catalysis.<br>
The cyano group is particularly preferably introduced with palladium cataly-<br>
sis.<br>
The invention therefore likewise relates to a process for the preparation of<br>
(3-cyano-1H-indol-7-yl)[4-(4-fluorophenethyl)piperazin-1 -yl]methanone of<br>
the formula I<br>
and salts thereof, characterised in that<br>
(1) an indole ester of the formula II<br>
in which<br>
R is an alky! group having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms or arylalkyl,<br>
is halogenated,<br>
(2) the halogen group of the ester of the formula VI<br>

preferred embodiments should therefore merely be regarded as descriptive<br>
disclosure which is absolutely not to be regarded as limiting in any way.<br>
All temperature data above and below are given in °C. In the following<br>
examples, "conventional work-up" means that water is added if necessary,<br>
the mixture is adjusted, if necessary, to a pH of between 2 and 10,<br>
depending on the constitution of the end product, the mixture is extracted<br>
with ethyl acetate or dichloromethane, the phases are separated, the<br>
organic phase is dried over sodium sulfate and evaporated, and the<br>
product is purified by chromatography on silica gel and/or by crystallisation.<br>
Example 1:<br>
1.1. Methyl 3-formylindole-7-carboxylate<br>
2.9 ml of phosphorus oxychloride are added slowly to 7 ml of N,N-dimethyl-<br>
formamide in a nitrogen atmosphere (formylation solution). 5 g (0.029 mol)<br>
of methyl indole-7-carboxy!ate are dissolved in 7 ml of DMF and added<br>
slowly to the formylation solution, during which the temperature does not<br>
rise above 30 degrees. The mixture is then warmed at 100° for one hour.<br>
After cooling, the mixture is poured into water and neutralised using sodium<br>
hydroxide solution, and the deposited crystals are filtered off with suction,<br>
m.p. 154°. Yield 5.3 g (89.9% of theory).<br>
1.2. Methyl 3-(hydroxyiminomethyl)indole-7-carboxylate<br>
5 g of methyl 3-formylindole-7-carboxylate (0.024 mol) are added to a solu-<br>
tion of 0.03 mol of hydroxylammonium hydrochloride in dimethylformamide.<br>
The reaction mixture is heated at 125° for one hour and subjected to con-<br>
ventional work-up, giving 5.1 g of methyl 3-(hydroxyiminomethyl)indole-7-<br>
carboxylate.<br>
1.3. Methyl 3-cyanoindole-7-carboxylate<br>
5 g of methyl 3-(hydroxyiminomethyl)indole-7-carboxylate are suspended in<br>
20 ml of toluene, 1 ml of sulfonyl chloride is added, and the mixture is<br>
refluxed for one hour. Evaporation and extraction with ethyl acetate give<br>
4.5 g of methyl cyanoindole-7-carboxylate, m.p. 212°.<br>
1.4. 3-Cyanoindole-7-carboxylic acid<br>
4.5 g (0.022 mol) of methyl cyanoindole-7-carboxylate are suspended in<br>
100 ml of methanol, and a solution of 30 ml of sodium hydroxide solution<br>
(w = 32%) in 30 ml of water is added at room temperature. Stirring over-<br>
night gives a virtually clear solution, which is filtered and evaporated. Water<br>
is added to the residue until a clear solution is formed, and the mixture is<br>
adjusted to pH = 2 using concentrated hydrochloric acid with ice-cooling.<br>
The white crystals are filtered off with suction and dried for 2 hours under<br>
reduced pressure, giving 4 g of 3-cyanoindole-7-carboxylic acid (97.7% of<br>
theory); m.p. 317.5 - 318.5°.<br>
1.5. 7-{4-[2-(4-FIuorophenyl)ethyl]piperazine-1 -carbonyl}-1H-indole-<br>
3-carbonitrile<br>
5 g (0.027 mol) of 3-cyanoindole-7-carboxylic acid are dissolved in 40 ml of<br>
hot N-methylpyrrolidone, the solution is cooled to 40°, and 7.6 g<br>
(0.027 mol) of N,N-carbonyldiimidazole are added. The mixture is stirred at<br>
room temperature for a further one hour. A suspension of 1-(2-(4-fluoro-<br>
phenyl)ethyl)piperazine dihydrochloride in 40 ml of N-methylpyrrolidone is<br>
subsequently poured in. After 5 minutes, a clear solution is formed and just<br>
afterwards white crystals deposit. The mixture is stirred overnight at room<br>
temperature. The crystals are filtered off with suction, washed and dried,<br>
giving 5 g of 7-{4-[2-(4-fluorophenyl)ethyl]piperazin-1-carbonyl}-1H-indole-<br>
3-carbonitrile as the free base having a melting point (m.p.) of 192.0 -<br>
193.5°.<br>
The chemical names 7-{4-[2-(4-fluorophenyl)ethyl]piperazine-1-carbonyl}-<br>
1H-indole-3-carbonitrile and (3-cyano-1H-indol-7-yl)[4-(4-fluorophenethyl)-<br>
piperazin-1-yl]methanone are synonymous.<br>
1.6. 7-{4-[2-(4-Fluorophenyl)ethyl]piperazin-1 -carbonyl}-1H-indole-<br>
3-carbonitrile, hydrochloride<br>
2.1g of the free base obtained in accordance with 1.5 are heated in 50 ml<br>
of acetone, and water is added until a clear solution is formed. A mixture of<br>
0.6 ml of hydrochloric acid (w = 37%) and 1.2 ml of acetone is then stirred<br>
in. The mixture is subsequently evaporated to half the volume in a rotary<br>
evaporator. The precipitated hydrochloride is filtered off with suction,<br>
washed with acetone and diethyl ether and dried, giving 1.6 g of 7-{4-[2-(4-<br>
fluorophenyl)ethyl]piperazin-1-carbonyl}-1H-indole-3-carbonitrile, hydro-<br>
chloride (69% of theory), decomposition range 314 - 319°.<br>
Example 2:<br>
2.1. Methyl 3-cyanoindole-7-carboxylate<br>
9.1 g of phosphoryl chloride are added to 30 ml of dimethylformamide with<br>
ice cooling at a reaction temperature of 20-30°. A solution of 8 g of methyl<br>
indole-7-carboxylate in dimethylformamide is added dropwise, during which<br>
the temperature rises to 40°. After one hour at 125°, the solution is added<br>
dropwise while still hot to a solution of 6.3 g of hydroxylammonium chloride<br>
in 40 ml of dimethylformamide, and the mixture is stirred at 120°C for a fur-<br>
ther 15 minutes. The mixture is poured into water, extracted with ethyl ace-<br>
tate, filtered through neutral aluminium oxide and evaporated, giving 4.5 g<br>
of methyl 3-cyanoindote-7-carboxylate having a melting range of 212 -<br>
213.5° (48.9% of theory).<br>
The further reaction is carried out analogously to Example 1.4. to 1.6.<br>
Example 3:<br>
3.1. Ethyl 3-bromoindole-7-carboxylate<br>
12 g of pyridine hydrobromide perbromide are added to a solution of 5 g of<br>
ethyl indole-7-carboxylate in 50 g of pyridine. The reaction mixture is<br>
warmed to 30-50° and stirred until the conversion is complete (from about 3<br>
to 10 hours).<br>
Conventional work-up gives ethyl 3-bromoindole-7-carboxylate.<br>
3.2. 3-Cyanoindole-7-carboxylic acid<br>
7 g of ethyl 3-bromoindole-7-carboxylate are dissolved in 70 g of NMP, and<br>
4 g of CuCN are added. The mixture is heated to 100-140°C with stirring.<br>
After 3 hours, the mixture is subjected to conventional work-up, giving<br>
3-cyanoindole-7-carboxylic acid.<br>
The further reaction of the 3-cyanoindole-7-carboxylic acid is carried out<br>
analogously to Example 1.5. to 1.6.<br>
