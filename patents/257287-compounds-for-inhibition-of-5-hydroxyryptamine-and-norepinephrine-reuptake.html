Compounds for inhibition of 5-hydroxytryptamine and<br>
norepinephrine reuptake or for treatment of depression disorders,<br>
their preparation processes and uses thereof<br>
IEC060036PCT (WO2006/133652)<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to compounds of formula (I) and salts thereof, their<br>
preparation processes, pharmaceutical compositions comprising them, and uses<br>
thereof for inhibition of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and norepinephrine (NA)<br>
reuptake and for treatment or adjunctive therapy of central nerve system<br>
disorders , such as depression, etc.<br>
Background Art<br>
It	is	reported	that	venlafaxine	of	formula	(II),<br>
1-[2-dimethylamino-1-(4-methoxyphenyl)-ethyl]-cyclohexanol, is an inhibitor of<br>
5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and norepinephrine (NA) reuptake, and is widely<br>
used for treatment of depression disorders, etc. Furthermore, after the compound<br>
of formula (II) is uptaken, it is metabolized in liver to form a strongly active<br>
metabolite (III), 1-[2-dimethylamino-1-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-ethyl]-cyclohexanol and<br>
weakly active metabolites, (IV), 1-[2-methylamino-1-(4-methoxyphenyl)-ethyl]-<br>
cyclohexanol, and (V), 1-[2-methylamino-1-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-ethyl]-cyclohexanol,<br>
wherein the compounds (II) and (III) have the same therapeutic effects (see also,<br>
US4535186, US20040176468, US20040147601, US20030191347, Wyeth<br>
Effexor description).<br>
As compared to the uptake of the compound (II), the direct uptake of the<br>
compound (III) for treating diseases related to central nerve system, especially<br>
depression, has the advantage of the principle of using a single active compound,<br>
facilitates the adjustment of dosage and therapeutic effects, alleviates side-effects,<br><br>
and reduces the risk of interaction with other drugs (see US6673838). However,<br>
the compound (III) with more hydroxyl groups results in the increase of<br>
hydrophilicity, and therefore decreases absorption rate via oral or transdermal<br>
and leads to possibly more pre-system side-effects due to unabsorbed drug. For<br>
overcoming the above drawbacks of the compound (III), a series of derivatives<br>
[compounds of formula (I)] of compound (III) are synthesized, and these<br>
compounds as the prodrugs of the compound (III) are metabolized in vivo to<br>
produce the compound (III), thereby exhibiting therapeutic effects.<br><br>
Contents of the Invention<br>
The purpose of the present invention is to develop new compounds which are<br>
used as prodrugs of inhibitor of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and<br><br>
norepinephrine (NA) reuptake, and especially used for the treatment of<br>
depression, etc. The compounds of formula (I) obtained thereby have the<br>
advantage of the principle of using a single active compound, facilitate the<br>
adjustment of dosage and therapeutic effects, alleviate side-effects, reduce the<br>
risk of interaction with other drugs, elevate bioavailability, and reduce<br>
pre-system side-effects due to un-absorbed drug.<br>
The present invention relates to compounds of formula (I), its optical isomers or<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts, which are used as prodrugs of inhibitors of<br>
5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and norepinephrine (NA) reuptake, and especially<br>
used for the treatment of depression, etc.<br><br>

added into 100mL dichloromethane, stirred and cooled to 0°C. 1.05g<br>
(9.9mmol) of triethylamine in dichloromethane solution was added dropwise<br>
( about ten minutes), then continuously stirred at room temperature for 18 hours.<br>
The reaction solution was washed with 50mL water and separated, then the<br>
organic phase was dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate, the solvent was<br>
removed by vacuum evaporation, and the product was dried under vacuum.<br>
Formation of salt (e.g., hydrochloride) of the compound VI<br>
30mL anhydrous aether solution containing 5mmol the above product was<br>
cooled to 0°C, and then 1M aether solution containing 4.8mmol hydrogen<br>
chloride was added under nitrogen gas o The oily precipitation was washed<br>
with anhydrous aether repetitively, and then dried under vacuum. Most products<br>
were amorphour foam-like solid.<br>

Example 6. Metabolic experiments of 4-[2-dimethylamino-1-(1-<br>
hydroxycyclohexyl)-ethyl]phenyl 4-methylbenzoate (the compound 1 of Example<br>
1) vial oral and intravenous administration in rats<br>
Six rats were divided into two groups, and were subjected to intragastric or<br>
intravenous administration of 4-[2-dimethylamino-1-(1-hydroxycyclohexyl)-<br>
ethyljphenyl 4-methylbenzoate hydrochloride in a dose of 13.5mg/kg. Blood<br>
samples were sampled according to the predetermined schedules, and the<br><br>
concentrations of the prodrug 4-[2-dimethylamino-1-(1-hydroxycyclohexyl)-<br>
ethyl]phenyl 4-methylbenzoate and the active metabolite 1-[2-<br>
dimethylamino-1-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-ethyl]cyclohexanol (compound III) in blood<br>
were measured.<br>
The results of intravenous administration in rats (see Fig.1A) indicate that the<br>
prodrug	4-[2-dimethylamino-1-(1 -hydroxycyclohexyl)-ethyl]phenyl<br>
4-methylbenzoate hydrochloride was quickly metabolized in blood of rats, and the<br>
active metabolite 1 -[2-dimethylamino-1-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-ethyl]cyclohexanol<br>
(compound III) (ODV) reached C max at 30 minutes, and in the meantime, the<br>
concentration of the prodrug in blood was only 10-15% of its active metabolite<br>
1-[2-dimethylamino-1-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-ethyl]cyclohexanol (compound III) (ODV)<br>
and decreased continuously.<br>
The results of oral administration are shown in Fig.1B. After the prodrug entered<br>
into body through gastrointestinal tract, it was metabolized immediately to form<br>
the active metabolite 1-[2-dimethylamino-1-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-ethyl]cyclohexanol<br>
(compound III) (ODV) with higher rate and degree and lower prodrug<br>
concentration. The prodrug via oral administration was substantively totally<br>
converted into the desired active metabolite 1-[2-dimethylamino-1-<br>
(4-hydroxyphenyl)-ethyl]cyclohexanol (compound III), which sufficiently confirmed<br>
the metabolizability of the prodrug 4-[2-dimethylamino-1-(1-<br>
hydroxycyclohexyl)-ethyl]phenyl 4-methylbenzoate. By calculation, the<br>
bioavailability of the prodrug 4-[2-dimethylamino-1-(1-hydroxycyclohexyl)-<br>
ethyl]phenyl 4-methylbenzoate hydrochloride via oral administration in rats was<br>
above 80%, which was obviously higher than the bioavailabilities of<br>
1-[2-dimethylamino-1-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-ethyl]-cyclohexanol (compound III)<br>
(ODV) and its various salts directly administrated orally.<br>

4-[2-dimethylamino-1-(1-hydroxycyclohexyl)-ethyl]phenyl 4-methoxybenzoate<br>
(the compound 3 of Example 1) succinate in beagles via oral administration<br>
Nine beagles with body weight of about 10 kg were divided into three groups, and<br>
were subjected to intragastric administration of O-desmethyl-venlafaxine (ODV)<br>
succinate, 4-[2-dimethylamino-1-(1-hydroxycyclohexyl)-ethyl] phenyl benzoate<br>
hydrochloride,	4-[2-dimethylamino-1-(1-hydroxycyclohexyl)-ethyl]phenyl<br>
4-methylbenzoate	hydrochloride,	and<br>
4-[2-dimethylamino-1-(1 -hydroxycyclohexyl)-ethyl]phenyl 4-methoxybenzoate<br>
succinate in dose of 0.016mmol/kg. Blood samples were sampled according to<br>
the predetermined schedules, and the concentrations of the active metabolite<br>
1-[2-dimethylamino-1-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-ethyl]cyclohexanol (compound III) and<br>
its prodrugs in blood were measured.<br>
The results are shown in Fig.2. After the prodrugs entered into bodies of beagles<br>
through gastrointestinal tract, they were immediated metabolized into the active<br>
metabolite desmethyl-venlafaxine, and the prodrug concentrations were lower<br>
than the measurement limit, so that it was deemed that almost all prodrugs by oral<br>
administration were converted into the desired active metabolite<br>
1-[2-dimethylamino-1-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-ethyl]cyclohexanol (compound III). In the<br>
meantime, the results indicate that the bioavailabilities of prodrugs of ODV were<br>
obviously higher than that of ODV succinate which has the best bioavailability<br>
among ODV salts, and AUC was elevated more than 30% (Table 2), wherein the<br>
AUC	of	4-[2-dimethylamino-1-(1-hydroxycyclohexyl)-ethyl]phenyl<br>
4-methylbenzoate hydrochloride was elevated more than 60% (Table 2), the<br><br>
bioavailability was improved very significantly, and it exhibited obvious<br>
advantages over 1 -[2-dimethylamino-1-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-ethyl]cyclohexanol<br>
(compound III) succinate.<br>
