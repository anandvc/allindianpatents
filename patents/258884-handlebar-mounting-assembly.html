TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The subject matter described herein, in general, relates to a handlebar mounting assembly for a motorcycle and more particularly to a handlebar mounting assembly for a motorcycle adapted to protect various cable harnesses. BACKGROUND<br>
A conventional handlebar assembly of a two-wheeler motorcycle is mounted on a steering system using fastening means such as nuts and bolts, screws, studs and the like. The handlebar assembly typically includes various control units for example, headlamp switch, electric start switch, horn switch, front indicators, clutch, accelerator, front wheel brake control, speedometer, and the like.<br>
The control units are wired to their respective functional units. For example, the horn switch is connected to a battery, which is in turn connected to the horn by means of electrical wires. The front wheel brake control is connected to the front wheel by means of cables. All such cables and wires terminating at or originating from the handlebar assembly are routed through the periphery of the point where the handlebar mounting assembly is mounted on the steering system. The conventional arrangement is such that the wires and cables are exposed to a protruded shank portion of the above mentioned fastening means. In case the two-wheelers take sharp turns on a road, the cables can come in direct contact with the exposed shank portion of the fastening means resulting in damages for example, puncturing and gradual wearing and tearing of the cables. Such damages can render various the cables and wires defunct so that the cables and wires have to be replaced. Therefore, the challenge is to secure such cables and wires from damages inflicted by fastening means.<br><br>
SUMMARY<br>
The present subject matter described herein is directed to a handlebar mounting assembly of two-wheelers, which incorporates a feature to protect various wires and cables routed through the periphery of fastening means employed to mount the handlebar assembly on a steering system of the two-wheelers. The handlebar mounting assembly having the feature of the present subject matter includes a handlebar, a steering system and an upper bracket. The steering system is made up of two parallel fork tubes pivotally supporting the front wheel at one end and a tubular element on the other end onto which an upper bracket is rigidly mounted. The handlebar mounting assembly is mounted on the upper bracket through a protective sheet to achieve resilience by fastening means such as nuts and bolts, screws and studs. The shape of the upper bracket is contoured to form an enclosed cavity within the upper bracket. The enclosed cavity of the upper bracket houses a shank portion or shanks of the bolts, or one end of the fastening means. The upper bracket provides means to conceal one end of the fastening means and thus shields the wires and cables from any kind of damages done by the fastening means while the two-wheeler motorcycles take sharp turns on road. Further, the upper bracket renders stiffness and reduces vibrations by adding its own weight to the steering system. Thus the upper bracket enables better handling of the motorcycle. The upper bracket described in the present subject matter is fabricated as a single piece. However, the upper bracket can also be fabricated as two or more pieces fixed to each other to form a single unit.<br>
These and other features, aspects, and advantages of the present subject matter will become better understood with reference to the following description and appended claims. This summary is proved to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form. This summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed<br><br>
subject matter, nor is it intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject<br>
matter.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS<br>
The above and other features, aspects, and advantages of the subject matter will become better understood with regard to the following description, appended claims, and accompanying drawings where:<br>
Fig. 1 shows a perspective view of a motorcycle with respect to one embodiment of the present subject matter.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a perspective view of the handlebar mounting assembly of a two-wheeler mounted on the steering system of two-wheeler motorcycle with respect to one embodiment of the present subject matter.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a perspective view of the upper bracket of the handlebar mounting assembly of a two-wheeler motorcycle with respect to one embodiment of the present subject matter.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a cross-sectional view of handlebar mounting assembly of a two-wheeler motorcycle with respect to one embodiment of the present subject matter. DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
In order to address the aforesaid challenges of securing cables and wires from damages inflicted by fastening means such as nuts and bolts, according to at least one embodiment of the present subject matter described herein, a handlebar mounting assembly is described. The handlebar mounting assembly incorporates a feature to protect the cables and the wires routed through the periphery of fastening means such as nuts and bolts. The fastening means such as nuts and bolts is employed to mount the handlebar assembly on a steering system of the two wheelers.<br><br>
The handlebar mounting assembly includes a handlebar and the steering system. The steering system of the two wheelers is made up of two parallel fork tubes. The two parallel fork tubes pivotally support the front wheel of the two wheeler at one end and a tubular element disposed at the other end. An upper bracket is rigidly mounted on the tubular element. The upper bracket is contoured to form a enclosed cavity within the upper bracket. The handlebar is mounted to the upper bracket through a protective sheet to achieve resilience by fastening means, such as nuts and bolts, such that a portion of the fastening means is enclosed inside the enclosed cavity of the upper bracket. Thus, the upper bracket provides means to conceal the fastening means, such as nuts and bolts, and thereby protects the cables and the wires from the damage done by fastening means such as nuts and bolts.<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates a perspective view of a two wheeler, more specifically a motorcycle, in accordance with one embodiment of the present subject matter. The embodiments disclosed herein are described in the context of a motorcycle. However, the embodiments and the subject matter herein can also be applied to other vehicles such as scooter type two or three-wheeled vehicles, all terrain vehicles, and other vehicles with more than two wheels.<br>
As used herein, the terms, "front", "rear", "left", "right", "up" and "down" correspond to the direction assumed by a driver of the vehicle. The motorcycle is configured for accommodating two persons, a rider and a pillion rider. The motorcycle includes a seat, a front wheel, a rear wheel and a handlebar assembly. The handlebar assembly includes a handlebar 100 and various wiring harness, which are discussed in detail in subsequent description.<br><br>
Although the illustrated embodiments are in the context of a motorcycle type vehicle, the subject matter disclosed herein is not limited to such an embodiment. Rather, the subject matter disclosed herein can be applied to any two-wheeled vehicle.<br>
Fig. 2 illustrates a perspective view of a handlebar mounting assembly mounted on the steering system 110 of the motorcycle according to an embodiment of the present subject matter. The handlebar mounting assembly includes a handlebar 100 of the two-wheeler motorcycle mounted to an upper bracket 105 through a protective sheet 145, as shown in Fig 3, to achieve resilience by means of bolts 125. As shown in Fig. 4, shank 140 of the bolt 125 remains enclosed inside the cavity of the upper bracket 105. Thus, by concealing the shank 140, a headlamp wire 120 may be protected from wiring harnesses or any other damages inflicted by shank 140. The upper bracket 105 is mounted on a tubular element 130 of the steering system 110.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a perspective view of the upper bracket 105 rigidly mounted on the tubular element 130 of the steering system 110 of the motorcycle. As shown in Fig. 2, the handlebar 100 is mounted on the upper bracket 105 through the protective sheet 145 to achieve resilience. Further, the upper bracket 105 is rigidly mounted on the tubular element 130 of the steering system 110 of the two-wheeler motorcycle.<br>
Fig. 4 is a cross-sectional view of the handlebar mounting assembly of the motorcycle in accordance with one embodiment of the present subject matter. The handlebar 100 of the motorcycle is mounted to the upper bracket 105 by means of nuts and bolts 125 through the protective sheet 145 as shown in Fig 3. The upper bracket 105 is rigidly mounted on the tubular element 130 of steering system 110 of the two-wheeler motorcycle. The upper bracket 105 conceals the shanks of the bohs 125 thereby preventing it to inflict any damage to wiring harness like the headlamp wire 120 of a<br><br>
headlamp assembly 115. The upper bracket 105 renders stiffness to the steering system 110 of two-wheeler motorcycle assembly and hence improves handling of the two-wheeler motorcycle.<br>
The embodiments described above can have many variations, each of which would be clear to a person skilled in the art having the benefit of the present subject matter. It must be noted here that the aforementioned specifications vis-a-vis the shape of the upper bracket 105, shape and length of the fastening means like nuts and bolts 125 are not limited those suggested herein and can be easily altered to suit varying functional and technical requirements. The fastening means may include but are not restricted to nuts and bolts, screws, studs and the like. Therefore, applicant intends to encompass within the language any structure presently existing or developed in future that performs the same fiinction.<br>
Although the subject matter has been described in considerable detail with reference to certain preferred embodiments thereof, other embodiments are possible. As such, the spirit and scope of the appended claims should not be limited to the description of the preferred embodiments contained therein.<br><br><br><br>
