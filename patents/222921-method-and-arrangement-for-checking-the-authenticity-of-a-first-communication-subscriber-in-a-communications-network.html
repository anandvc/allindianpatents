				<td>The invention relates to a method and an arrangement for checking<br>
the authenticity of a first communication subscriber in a<br>
communication network.<br>
In a communications network* data is generally transmitted<br>
between communication subscribers for example a service provider<br>
and a service user. In order to protect a communications network<br>
against penetration of an unauthorised communication subscriber<br>
into the communications network the authenticity of each<br>
communication subscriber is generally checked.<br>
Document [1] discloses a method and an arrangement for checking<br>
the authenticity of a communication subscriber in particular of<br>
a service provider or of a service user in a communication<br>
network.<br>
the method known from document [l] and the corresponding<br>
arrangement are based on what is referred to as 36 T8 33.102<br>
Version 3.0.0 Draft Standard, which describes a security<br>
architecture of a mobile phone system.<br>
In Fig. 4, the procedure during the checking of the authenticity<br>
of a communication subscriber cuch as is known from the document<br>
[1] in illustrated symbolically and parts thereof will be<br>
explained below briefly.<br>
A transmission of data 10 illustrated in Fig. 4 by an arrow in<br>
each case. A direction of an arrow characterizes a<br>
transmission direction during a data transmission.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a mobile phone system 400, comprising a<br>
user 401 of a communication service, for example a<br>
mobile phone, and a provider 402 of a communication<br>
service. The provider 402 comprises a dial-in network<br>
403 with a dial-in network operator from which the user<br>
401 locally requests a communication service, and a<br>
home network 404 with a home network operator with<br>
which the user 401 is signed on and registered.<br>
In addition, the user 401, the dial-in network 403 and<br>
the home network 404 each have a central processing<br>
unit with a memory, for example a server (central<br>
computing unit), with which processing unit the<br>
procedure described below is monitored and controlled<br>
and on which memory data is stored.<br>
The dial-in network 403 and the home network 404 are<br>
connected to one another via a data line over which<br>
digital data can be transmitted. The user 401 and the<br>
dial-in network 403 are connected to one another via<br>
any desired transmission medium for the transmission of<br>
digital data.<br>
During a communication, the user 401 dials 410 into the<br>
dial-in network 403. At the start of the communication,<br>
checking of both the authenticity of the user 401 and<br>
the authenticity of the provider 402 is carried out.<br>
To do this, the dial-in network 403 requests 411 what<br>
is referred to as authentication data from the home<br>
network 404, with which data the authenticity of the<br>
user 401 and of the provider 402 can be checked.<br>
The authentication data which is obtained from the home<br>
network 404 comprises a random number and a sequential<br>
number of the provider 402. The sequential number of<br>
the provider 402 is obtained in such a way that a<br>
counter of the provider 402 increases the sequential<br>
number of the provider 402 by the value 1 at each<br>
attempt at communication between the user<br>
461 and the provider 402.<br>
It is to be noted that the random number and the<br>
sequential number of the provider 402 only constitute<br>
part of the authentication data and are not to be<br>
understood as comprehensive. Further authentication<br>
data is known from [1].<br>
The home network 404 transmits 412 the requested<br>
authentication data to the dial-in network 403. The<br>
dial-in network 403 processes the received<br>
authentication data in a suitable way 413, and<br>
transmits 414 the processed authentication data to the<br>
user 401.<br>
The user 401 checks 415 the authenticity of the<br>
provider 402 using a dedicated sequential number, which<br>
is handled in a way corresponding to the sequential<br>
number of the provider 402, and using the sequential<br>
number of the provider 402.<br>
The procedure during the checking of the authenticity<br>
of the provider 402 is described in [1].<br>
A result of the checking of the authenticity of<br>
provider 402, "authenticity of provider<br>
satisfactory" 416, "authenticity of provider<br>
satisfactory but sequential fault has occurred" 417 or<br>
"authenticity of provider not satisfactory" 418, is<br>
transmitted 419 from the user 401 to the provider 402.<br>
In the case of the result "authenticity of provider<br>
satisfactory" 416, the dial-in network 403 checks 420<br>
the authenticity of the user 401 as described in [1].<br>
In the case of the result "authenticity of provider not<br>
satisfactory" 418, the communication is interrupted<br>
and/or restarted 421.<br>
In the case of the result "authenticity of provider<br>
satisfactory but a sequential fault has occurred" 417,<br>
resynchronization takes place in such a way that the<br>
home network 404 transmits 422 a resynchronization<br>
request to the user 401. The user responds with a<br>
resynchronization response in which resynchronization<br>
data is transmitted 423 to the home network 404. The<br>
sequential number of the provider 402 is changed 424 as<br>
a function of the resynchronization response. The<br>
authenticity of the user 401 is then checked, as is<br>
known from [1].<br>
The procedure described has the disadvantage that<br>
during checking of the authenticity of a communication<br>
subscriber, in particular during the checking of the<br>
authenticity of a service provider, a large amount of<br>
data has to be transmitted between the communication<br>
subscribers.<br>
The invention is thus based on the problem of<br>
disclosing a method which is simplified and improved in<br>
comparison with the known method and the known<br>
arrangement, and a simplified and improved arrangement<br>
for checking the authenticity communication.<br>
subscriber in a communications network.<br>
The problem is solved by means of the methods and by<br>
means of the arrangements having the features in<br>
(accordance with the independent patent claims.<br>
In the method for checking the authenticity of a first<br>
communication subscriber in a communications network, a<br>
first fault information item is formed in the first<br>
communication subscriber using a fault detection data<br>
item of the first communication subscriber and an<br>
information item relating to a random data item. In a<br>
second communication subscriber in the communications<br>
network, a second fault information item is formed<br>
using a fault detection data item of the first<br>
communication subscriber and the information relating<br>
to the random data<br>
item.<br>
The authenticity of the first communication subscriber<br>
is checked using the first fault information item and<br>
the second fault information item.<br>
In the arrangement for checking the authenticity of a<br>
first communication subscriber in a communications<br>
network, the first communication subscriber is set up<br>
in such a way that a first fault information item can<br>
be formed using a fault detection data item of the<br>
first communication subscriber and an information item<br>
relating to a random data item. In addition, the<br>
arrangement has a second communication subscriber in<br>
the communications network which is set up in such a<br>
way that a second fault information item can be formed<br>
using a fault detection data item Of the second<br>
communication subscriber and the information relating<br>
to the random data item. The authenticity of the first<br>
communication subscriber can be checked using the first<br>
fault information item and the second fault information<br>
item.<br>
The checking of the authenticity of a communication<br>
subscriber in a communications network is to be<br>
understood as meaning method steps which are carried<br>
out in the wider sense with checking of the<br>
authorization of a communication subscriber for access<br>
to a communications network or participation in<br>
communication in a communications network.<br>
This thus encompasses both method steps which are<br>
carried out within the scope of the checking of the<br>
authorization of a communication subscriber for access<br>
to a communications network and such method steps which<br>
are carried out within the scope of the processing or<br>
the administration of data which is used in the<br>
checking.<br>
Preferred developments of the invention are given in<br>
the dependent claims.<br>
The developments described below relate to the method<br>
and to the arrangement.<br>
The invention and the development described below can<br>
be implemented either using software or hardware, for<br>
example using a specific electrical circuit.<br>
In one refinement, the first communication subscriber<br>
is a service provider and/or the second communication<br>
subscriber is a service user in the communications<br>
network.<br>
A sequential number is preferably used as the fault<br>
detection data item.<br>
In one refinement, the information relating to the<br>
random data item is a random number.<br>
In one development, the checking of the authenticity is<br>
simplified by determining a difference between the<br>
fault detection data item of the first communication<br>
subscriber and the fault detection data item of the<br>
second communication subscriber.<br>
In one refinement, the checking of the authenticity is<br>
further improved with respect to the security of the<br>
communications network by limiting the difference.<br>
One development is preferably used within the scope of<br>
a mobile phone system. In the mobile phone system, the<br>
service user is implemented as a mobile phone and/or<br>
the service provider is implemented as a mobile phone<br>
network operator.<br>
An exemplary embodiment of the invention which is<br>
explained in more detail below is illustrated in the<br>
figures, in which figures:<br>
Figure 1 shows a mobile phone system;<br>
Figure 2 shows an outline in which checking of the<br>
authenticity of a communication subscriber is<br>
illustrated symbolically;<br>
Figure 3 shows a flowchart in which individual method<br>
steps are illustrated during checking of the<br>
authenticity of a service provider in a<br>
communications network;<br>
Figure 4 shows an outline in which checking of the<br>
authenticity of a communication subscriber in<br>
accordance with the 3G TS 33.102 Version<br>
3.0.0 Standard is illustrated symbolically.<br>
Exemplary embodiment: mobile phone system<br>
A mobile phone system 100 is illustrated in Fig. 1. The<br>
mobile phone systerr 100, comprises e mobile phone 101, a<br>
local dial-in network 102 with a dial-in network<br>
operator 103 and a home network 104 with a home network<br>
operator 105.<br>
The mobile phone 101 is signed on and registered in the<br>
home network 104.<br>
In addition, the mobile phone 101, the dial-in network<br>
102 and the home network 104 each have a central<br>
processing unit 106, 107, 108 with a<br>
memory 109, 110, 111, with which processing units<br>
106, 107, 108 the procedure described below is<br>
monitored and controlled, and<br>
on which memories 109, 110, 111 data is stored.<br>
The dial-in network 102 and the home network 104 are<br>
connected to one another via a data line 112 via which<br>
digital data can be transmitted. The mobile phone 101<br>
and the dial-in network 102 are connected to one<br>
another via any desired transmission medium 113 for<br>
transmitting digital data.<br>
The procedure during the checking of the authenticity<br>
of the mobile phone 101 and the procedure during the<br>
checking of the authenticity of the home network 104<br>
and/or of the home network operator 105 are illustrated<br>
symbolically in Fig. 2, and parts thereof will be<br>
explained below briefly.<br>
The transmission of data in Fig. 2 is illustrated in<br>
each case by an arrow. A direction of an arrow<br>
characterizes a transmission direction during a data<br>
transmission.<br>
The procedure which is described below and illustrated<br>
symbolically in Fig. 2 is based on what is referred to<br>
aa a 30 TS 33.102 Version 3.0.0 Standard, which<br>
describes a security architecture of a mobile phone<br>
system and is described in [1] .<br>
During a communication, the mobile phone 201 dials 210<br>
into the dial-in network 203. At the start of the<br>
communication, checking both of the authenticity of the<br>
mobile phone 201 and of the authenticity of the home<br>
network 204 and/or of the home network operator takes<br>
place.<br>
To do this, the dial-in network 203 requests 211<br>
authentication data from the home network 204, with<br>
which authentication data the authenticity of the user<br>
201 and of the home network 204 and/or of The home<br>
network operator can be checked.<br>
The authentication data which is determined by the home<br>
network 204 comprises a random number and a sequential<br>
number of the home network 204 (cf. Fig. 3 step 310).<br>
The sequential number of the home network 204 is<br>
determined in such a way that a counter of the home<br>
network 204 increases the sequential number of the home<br>
network 204 by the value 1 at each attempt at<br>
communication between the mobile phone 201 and the home<br>
network 204.<br>
It is to be noted that the random number and the<br>
sequential number of the home network 204 only<br>
constitute part of the authentication data and are not<br>
to be understood as comprehensive. Further<br>
authentication data is specified in [1].<br>
The home network 204 transmits 212 the requested<br>
authentication data to the dial-in network 203. The<br>
dial-in network 203 processes the received<br>
authentication data in a suitable way 213 and transmits<br>
214 the processed authentication data to the mobile<br>
phone 201.<br>
The mobile phone 201 checks 215 the authenticity of the<br>
home network 204 using a dedicated sequential number"<br>
which is handled in a way corresponding to the<br>
sequential number of the home network 204, and using<br>
the sequential number of the home network 204. In a way<br>
corresponding to the home network 204, the mobile phone<br>
201 also has a counter.<br>
The procedure during the checkinq of the authenticity<br>
of the home network 204 is described in [l] . Method<br>
steps which differ" therefrom are described below.<br>
What is referred to as overflow checking of the counter<br>
of the mobile phone 201 is carried out within the scope<br>
of the checking of the authenticity of the home network<br>
203. This overflow checking prevents overflowing of an<br>
acceptable numerical range of the counter of the mobile<br>
phone 201.<br>
In the overflow checking, the following conditions are<br>
tested:<br>
1) sequential number of the home network 204 &gt;<br>
sequential number of the mobile phone 201;<br>
2) sequential number of the home network 204<br>
sequential number of the mobile phone 201 
predefinable deviation (1,000,000);<br>
the following applying for the predefined deviation:<br>
predefinable deviation is sufficiently large in<br>
order to ensure, during normal or fault-free<br>
communications operation:<br>
that the sequential number of the home network 204 -<br>
sequential number of the mobile phone 201 is not &gt;<br>
predefinable deviation;<br>
the maximum permissable sequential number of the<br>
mobile phone 201/predefinable deviation is sufficiently<br>
large in order to ensure the" the maximum permissible-<br>
sequential number of the mobile,, phone 201 is not<br>
reached during operation.<br>
The result of the checking of the authenticity of the<br>
home network 204, "authenticity satisfactory" 216,<br>
"authenticity satisfactory but a sequential fault has<br>
occurred" 217 or "authenticity not satisfactory" 218 is<br>
transmitted 419 to the home network 204 from the mobile<br>
phone 201.<br>
In the case of the result "authenticity satisfactory"<br>
216, the dial-in network 203 checks 220 the<br>
authenticity of the mobile phone 201, as described in<br>
[1].<br>
In the case of the result "authenticity not<br>
satisfactory" 218, the communication is interrupted or<br>
restarted 221<br>
In the case of the result "authenticity satisfactory<br>
but a sequential fault has occurred" 217,<br>
resynchronization 222 takes place. Resynchronization is<br>
to be understood as a change of the sequential number<br>
of the home network 204.<br>
For this purpose, the mobile phone 201 transmits 222<br>
resynchronization data to the dial-in network 203.<br>
The resynchronization data comprises the same random<br>
number which was transmitted within the scope of the<br>
authentication data, and the sequential number of the<br>
mobile phone 201 (cf. Fig. 3 step 320).<br>
The dial-in network 203 processes the resynchronization<br>
data in a suitable way and transmits the processed<br>
resynchronization data to the home network 204.<br>
The home network checks the sequential number of the<br>
mobile phone 201 and the sequential number of the home<br>
network 204 using the processed resynchronization data,<br>
and if appropriate changes 223 the sequential number of<br>
the home network 204 (cf. Fig. 3 step 330).<br>
The home network 204 subsequently transmits new<br>
authentication data, which if appropriate comprises the<br>
changed sequential number of the home network 204, to<br>
the dial-in network 203.<br>
In order to illustrate the described procedure,<br>
important steps 300 of the procedure are illustrated in<br>
Fig. 3.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a first step 310 within the scope of which<br>
the authentication data (first fault information) is<br>
determined.<br>
The resynchronization data (second fault information)<br>
is determined within the scope of a second step 320.<br>
The sequential number of the mobile phone and the<br>
sequential number of the home network are checked<br>
within the scope of a third step 330, using the<br>
resynchronization data.<br>
An alternative of the first exemplary embodiment is<br>
described below.<br>
In the alternative exemplary embodiment, a method is<br>
implemented in which the home network is made more<br>
reliable with respect to a data loss in the event of a<br>
system crash.<br>
For this purpose, the current sequential number of the<br>
home network is stored in the memory of the home<br>
network, in each case at a predef inable time interval.<br>
A sequential number of the home network which has been<br>
lost during a system crash of the home network is<br>
restored in such a way that a predefinable additional<br>
value is added to the value of the stored sequential<br>
number. The predefinable additional value is<br>
'dimensioned in such a way that exceeding of the sum of<br>
the sequential number of the mobile phone and the<br>
predefinabie deviation is not exceeded.<br>
In the alternative exemplary embodiment, the<br>
predefinable additional value is determined in such a<br>
way that an average number of authentication attempts<br>
on one' "day by the home network, which number is<br>
determined during operation of the communications<br>
network, is multiplied by a factor with the value 10.<br>

fault detection data item is changed.<br>
14. Arrangement for checking the authenticity of a<br>
first communication subscriber (203, 204) in a<br>
communications network having the first<br>
communication subscriber and having a second<br>
communication subscriber (201).<br>
- in which the first communication subscriber is set<br>
up in such a may that a first fault detection data<br>
item is formed at the first communication<br>
subscriber,<br>
- in which the second communication subscriber is<br>
set up in such a way that at the second communi-<br>
cation subscriber a fault information item is<br>
formed using a formed, second fault detection data<br>
item of the second communication subscriber and an<br>
information item relating to a random data item<br>
which was transmitted from the first communication<br>
subscriber to the second communication subscriber<br>
said fault information item including the second<br>
fault detection data item of the second communicat-<br>
ion subscriber and the information item relating to<br>
the random data item<br>
- in which the fault information item is transmitted<br>
from the second communication subscriber to the<br>
first communication subscriber<br>
- in which the first communication subscriber is set<br>
up in such a way that at the first communication<br>
subscriber the second fault detection data item<br>
and the first fault detection data item are checked<br>
using the fault information item.<br>
The invention relates to a method for checking the<br>
authenticity of a first communication subscriber (203, 204) in a<br>
communications network having the first communication subscriber<br>
and having a second communication subscriber (201), in which a<br>
first fault detection data item is formed at the first<br>
communication subscriber, in which at the second communication<br>
subscriber a fault information item is formed using a formed<br>
second fault detection data item of the second communication<br>
subscriber and an information item relating to a random data item<br>
which was transmitted from the first communication subscriber to<br>
the second communication subscriber said fault information item<br>
including the second fault detection data item of the second<br>
communication subscriber and the information item relating to the<br>
random data item in which the fault information item is<br>
transmitted from the second communication subscriber to the first<br>
communication subscriber in which at the first communication<br>
subscriber the second fault detection data item of the second<br>
communication subscriber and the first fault detection data item<br>
of the first communication subscriber are checked using the fault<br>
information item.</td>
