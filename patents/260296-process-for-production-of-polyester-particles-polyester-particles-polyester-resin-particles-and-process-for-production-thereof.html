TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a process for<br>
producing polyester particles with a low degree of<br>
polymerization and polyester particles, and further<br>
relates to a process for producing polyester resin<br>
particles by solid phase polycondensation of the<br>
polyester particles and polyester resin particles. More<br>
particularly, it relates to a process of forming a<br>
polyester with a low degree of polymerization to strands<br>
and then cutting the strands, capable of producing<br>
polyester particles stably at a high speed, and polyester<br>
particles which have a substantially cylindroid shape.<br>
Further, it relates to a process for efficiently<br>
producing polyester resin particles with a high degree of<br>
polymerization excellent in processability, which<br>
comprises subjecting the above polyester particles with a<br>
small particle size, having a substantially cylindroid<br>
shape and suitable for solid phase polycondensation at a<br>
high speed, to solid phase polycondensation, and<br>
polyester resin particles.<br><br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
A polyester represented by a polyethylene<br>
terephthalate is excellent in mechanical properties,<br>
thermal properties, electrical properties, etc. and is<br>
thereby widely Used for fibers and for molded products<br>
such as films, sheets and bottles for various<br>
applications and its demand is expanding. A polyester to<br>
be used for such applications is usually produced by<br>
subjecting a dicarboxylic acid and/or its ester-forming<br>
derivative and a diol to esterification and/or ester<br>
exchange reaction and then melt polycondensation<br>
reaction, and as the case requires, further to solid<br>
phase polycondensation.<br>
A polyester after the melt polycondensation reaction<br>
is usually granulated to particles with a particle size<br>
of from about 1 mm to about several mm so as to be formed<br>
into a product or to be subjected to solid phase<br>
polycondensation. As a granulation method, usually, a<br>
method (hereinafter sometimes referred to as a "strand<br>
cutting method") of discharging a melt polycondensed polyester from a die plate having a plurality of pores<br>
(die holes) into a gas phase to form the polyester into<br>
strands, and subsequently cutting the strands by a fixed<br>
blade and a rotary blade having a rotation axis<br>
substantially at a right angle to the discharge direction<br>
under cooling with water or after cooling with water, is<br>
excellent in view of production efficiency and is<br><br>
commonly conducted.<br>
However, when a polyester having a relatively low<br>
intrinsic viscosity after the melt polycondensation<br>
reaction, for example, an intrinsic viscosity of at most<br>
about 0.3 dL/g, is to be granulated in order that the<br>
polyester is used for special purpose or to be subjected<br>
to solid phase polycondensation, the polyester can hardly<br>
be wound in the form of strands since it has a low melt<br>
viscosity, and the strands after cooled are fragile, and<br>
accordingly granulation by the above strand cutting<br>
method has been known to be very difficult. Therefore,<br>
as a method of granulating such a polyester having a low<br>
intrinsic viscosity, for example, Patent Documents 1 and<br>
2 propose granulation method other than the strand<br>
cutting method.<br>
Further, as an improved strand cutting method,<br>
Patent Document 3 discloses a method of extruding a large<br>
number of strands of a molten thermoplastic resin<br>
material from multiple die toward an inclined trough<br>
including a coolant stream to bring the strands into<br>
contact with water in the trough, carrying the strands<br>
downward by the stream to rapidly cool the stands and<br>
then cutting the strands into particles by a strand<br>
cutter. The document discloses a method wherein the<br>
linear velocity of the coolant stream flowing down the<br>
trough is higher than the linear velocity of the strands<br>
extruded from the die, and the edge of strands newly<br><br>
formed which have passed through the strand cutter<br>
connected to the edge of the tough directly with the<br>
strands are made to pass through an apparatus along a<br>
flow path similar to the flow path of preceding strands.<br>
The above disclosed method is a method excellent for<br>
forming (pelletizing) a thermoplastic resin material as a<br>
common molding material into particles, but by this<br>
method, strands of a polyester low polymer having a very<br>
low melt viscosity will not stably run, and formation<br>
into particles is difficult. Further, particles to be<br>
subjected to solid phase polycondensation are required to<br>
have a small particle size so as to increase the solid<br>
phase polycondensation reaction rate, but with the<br>
technique disclosed, it is further difficult to obtain<br>
particles with a small particle size.<br>
Patent Document 4 discloses a method of stretching a<br>
ribbon, gut or sheet of a polyester with a low degree of<br>
polymerization having an intrinsic viscosity of from 0.32<br>
to 0.40 dL/g between rolls with a draw ratio less than 2<br>
times, followed by cutting. In this method, as shown in<br>
Figs. 1 and 2 of the Patent Document 4, the range of the<br>
proper draw ratio is very narrow at an intrinsic<br>
viscosity of at most 0.35, and this method can not be<br>
employed for practical use.<br>
Further, Patent Document 5 discloses a method of<br>
forming a molten polymer containing a polyester as the<br>
main component to a molding material in the form of<br><br>
pellets, which comprises cooling molten polymer strands<br>
discharged from an outlet in the air for from 0.10 to<br>
0.50 seconds and then bringing them into contact with<br>
cooling water and solidifying them to form pellets.<br>
However, by the method disclosed in the document,<br>
favorable pellets can not necessarily be obtained from a<br>
polyester having a low melt viscosity.<br>
Further, Patent Document 6 discloses cylindrical<br>
particles made of a polyester having an inherent<br>
viscosity of from about 0.20 to about 0.45 dL/g and their<br>
production method. The requirement of the method<br>
disclosed in the above document is that molten strands<br>
are made to pass in a narrow air gap i.e. an air gap less<br>
than about 4 inch (less than about 0.10 m) before rapidly<br>
cooled by a cooling medium to obtain cylindrical<br>
particles. However, in this method, it is difficult to<br>
stably granulate a low viscosity polyester, and<br>
particularly, it is difficult to efficiently produce<br>
polyester particles with a small particle size having a<br>
substantially cylindroid shape, suitable for solid phase<br>
polycondensation at a high speed in the present<br>
invention, from a low viscosity polyester.<br>
As described above, no specific method of<br>
efficiently forming a polyester with a low degree of<br>
polymerization into particles has been known yet.<br>

DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
OBJECTS TO BE ACCOMPLISHED BY THE INVENTION<br>
Under these circumstances, the object of the present<br>
invention is to provide a process for efficiently-<br>
producing polyester particles with a small particle size<br>
from a polyester with a low degree of polymerization and<br>
a low melt viscosity by a strand cutting method, and<br>
polyester particles having a substantially cylindroid<br>
shape. A further object of the present invention is to<br>
provide a process for producing polyester resin particles<br>
with a high degree of polymerization, which comprises the<br>
above polyester particles having a substantially<br>
cylindroid shape to solid phase polycondensation, and<br>
polyester resin particles having a substantially<br>
cylindroid shape. <br>
MEANS TO ACCOMPLISH THE OBJECTS<br>
Namely, the present invention resides in a process<br>
for producing polyester particles, characterized in that<br>
the following steps (1) to (3) are sequentially carried<br>
out, and the drawing rate ratio of polyester strands<br>
represented by the following formula is from 1.5 to 100:<br><br>
(1)	a step of discharging a molten polyester having<br>
a melt viscosity of from 0.5 Pa-s to 50 Pa-s from a die<br>
hole into strands,<br>
(2)	a step of bringing the obtained polyester<br>
strands into contact with a liquefied fluid for cooling<br>
to lead the strands to a cutter together with the<br>
liquefied fluid, and<br>
(3)	a step of cutting the polyester strands led to<br>
the cutter:<br>
drawing rate ratio = (linear velocity of strands<br>
immediately before cut (v2 (m/s)))/(linear velocity of<br>
molten polyester when discharged from die hole (vl<br>
(m/s))); and polyester particles having a substantially<br>
cylindroid shape.<br>
The present invention further resides in a process<br>
for producing polyester resin particles, which comprises<br>
subjecting the above polyester particles having a<br>
substantially cylindroid shape to solid phase<br>
polycondensation reaction, and polyester resin particles<br>
having a substantially cylindroid shape.<br>
EFFECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to the present invention, a polyester with<br>
a low degree of polymerization can be formed into<br>
particles stably, particularly, polyester particles with<br>
a low degree of polymerization, having a substantially<br>
cylindroid shape and having a small and uniform particle<br><br>
size, can efficiently be obtained. Further, by using<br>
such particles with a small particle size having a<br>
specific shape, in a solid phase polycondensation<br>
reaction, solid phase polycondensation can be conducted<br>
at a high speed, and accordingly polyester resin<br>
particles with a high degree of polymerization and<br>
excellent in processability, suitable for packaging<br>
materials for e.g. bottles, for industrial fibers, etc.,<br>
can efficiently be obtained.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Now, the present invention will be described in<br>
detail. However, the following description is a<br>
representative example, and the present invention is by<br>
no means restricted thereto.<br>
The present invention provides a process for<br>
efficiently producing polyester particles from a<br>
polyester having a low melt viscosity by a strand cutting<br>
method, and polyester particles having a substantially<br>
cylindroid shape. Further, it relates to a process for<br>
producing polyester resin particles with a high degree of<br>
polymerization, which comprises subjecting the polyester<br>
particles having a substantially cylindroid shape to<br>
solid phase polycondensation, and polyester resin<br>
particles having a substantially cylindroid shape.<br>
The process for producing polyester particles of the<br>
present invention (hereinafter sometimes referred to as a<br><br>
particles forming process) is a process for efficiently<br>
producing polyester particles having a low intrinsic<br>
viscosity, particularly polyester particles having a<br>
substantially cylindroid shape from a polyester with a<br>
low degree of polymerization having a low melt viscosity<br>
by a strand cutting method under predetermined operation<br>
conditions.<br>
Namely, the process of the present invention is a<br>
process for producing polyester particles, characterized<br>
in that the following steps (1) to (3) are sequentially<br>
carried out, and the drawing rate ratio of polyester<br>
strands represented by the following formula is from 1.5<br>
to 100:<br>
(1)	a step of discharging a molten polyester having<br>
a melt viscosity of from 0.5 Pa-s to 50 Pa-s from a die<br>
hole into strands,<br>
(2)	a step of bringing the obtained polyester<br>
strands into contact with a liquefied fluid for cooling<br>
to lead the strands to a cutter together with the<br>
liquefied fluid, and<br>
(3)	a step of cutting the polyester strands led to<br>
the cutter:<br>
drawing rate ratio = (linear velocity of strands<br>
immediately before cut (v2 (m/s)))/(linear velocity of<br>
molten polyester when discharged from die hole (vl<br>
(m/s)))<br>
According to the particles forming process of the<br><br>
present invention, particles having a desired shape can<br>
efficiently be obtained from a polyester with a low<br>
degree of polymerization after the melt polycondensation<br>
reaction, having a melt viscosity at the time of<br>
discharge of from 0.5 Pa-s to 50 Pa-s. Therefore,<br>
achievement of a high degree of polymerization is not<br>
required in the melt polycondensation reaction, and an<br>
expensive equipment to carry out stirring of a liquid<br>
with a high viscosity and reaction in high vacuum in the<br>
melt polycondensation step is unnecessary. Further,<br>
according to the process of the present invention,<br>
particles with a small particle size having a<br>
substantially cylindroid shape can be obtained, and when<br>
such polyester particles with a small particle size are<br>
subjected to solid phase polycondensation, it is possible<br>
to increase the solid phase polycondensation rate.<br>
Therefore, the process is a very useful process capable<br>
of efficiently producing polyester resin particles with a<br>
high degree of polymerization.<br>
The melt viscosity is a complex viscosity of a<br>
polyester to be formed into particles measured at a shear<br>
rate of 10 rad/s by a dynamic viscoelasticity measuring<br>
apparatus (rheometer) at a temperature of a molten<br>
polyester when discharged from a die hole.<br>
Regarding the polyester to be used in the above step<br>
(1) in the particles forming process of the present<br>
invention, the melt viscosity of the polyester when<br><br>
discharged from a die hole to strands i.e. polyester<br>
strands is from 0.5 Pa-s to 50 Pa-s. The lower limit is<br>
preferably 1.5 Pa-s, more preferably 2.5 Pa-s. The upper<br>
limit is preferably 20 Pa-s, more preferably 10 Pa-s. If<br>
the melt viscosity of the polyester is less than 0.5<br>
Pa-s, the melt viscosity is too low when the polyester is<br>
discharged from the die hole, and no stable strands will<br>
be obtained, and the strands may be broken in some cases.<br>
On the other hand, if it exceeds 50 Pa-s, since the<br>
diameter of the die hole required to obtain polyester<br>
particles with a small particle size is small, the<br>
polyester hardly passes through the die hole, thus<br>
leading to lack of operation stability. Further, to<br>
obtain a polyester having a high melt viscosity, an<br>
expensive equipment to carry out stirring of a liquid<br>
with a high viscosity and reaction in high vacuum will be<br>
required in the above-described melt polycondensation<br>
reaction, such being unfavorable.<br>
The melt viscosity of the polyester particles<br>
obtained by the particles forming process of the present<br>
invention is equal to the melt viscosity of the strands.<br>
In the particles forming process of the present<br>
invention, the drawing rate ratio of strands (hereinafter<br>
represented by r) is the ratio of the linear velocity (v2<br>
(m/s)) of strands immediately before cut to the linear<br>
velocity (vl (m/s)) of the molten polyester when<br>
discharged from the die hole, represented by the<br><br>
following formula:<br>
r = (v2 (m/s))/(vl (m/s))<br>
wherein vl (m/s) = (discharged weight (kg/s) per unit<br>
time (s: second) per one die hole/density (kg/m3) of<br>
polyester)/(die hole outlet area (m2)), and v2 (m/s) is<br>
the linear velocity of the strands immediately before cut<br>
by a cutter and is usually the same as the linear<br>
velocity of the strands when cut by a cutter, and<br>
accordingly it is calculated in accordance with the<br>
following formula from the number (n) of cogs of a rotary<br>
blade of the cutter, the number of revolutions (R (1/s))<br>
and the length (L (m)) of the cut particles in the<br>
discharge direction:<br>
v2 (m/s) = RnL (m/s).<br>
Further, in a case where a drawing roll to draw the<br>
strands is disposed before the cutter, the v2 (m/s) can<br>
be calculated in accordance with the following formula<br>
from the number of revolutions of the drawing roll as a<br>
component in the direction of the tangent line of the<br>
speed of revolution on the side of the drawing roll:<br>
v2 (m/s) = (diameter (m) of drawing roll) x (number<br>
of revolutions (1/s) of drawing roll) x (pi)<br>
An apparatus having a drawing roll to lead the<br>
strands stably to the cutter disposed particularly before<br>
the cutter is preferably used, and in such a case, the<br>
above method to determine v2 (m/s) from the number of<br>
revolutions of the drawing roll is simple and used<br><br>
preferably.<br>
The drawing rate ratio r is adjusted so that the<br>
strands together with a liquefied fluid for cooling are<br>
led to the cutter and cut properly. As an adjustment<br>
method, for example, the flow rate of the liquefied fluid<br>
moving together with the strands is changed, and/or the<br>
speed of revolution of the drawing roll which draws the<br>
strands is changed immediately before the strands are cut<br>
by a cutter.<br>
The lower limit of the drawing rate ratio r is 1.5,<br>
preferably 2. If it is less than 1.5, the strands<br>
discharged from the die hole will not stably move<br>
together with the liquefied fluid, the strands may wind<br>
or may be too thick and accordingly the subsequent<br>
cutting by a cutter can not smoothly be carried out,<br>
whereby the particle size will not be uniform, and<br>
irregular deformed particles having a particularly large<br>
particle size may form in some cases. The upper limit of<br>
the drawing rate ratio r is 100, preferably 50, more<br>
preferably 20. If it exceeds 100, the strands may be too<br>
thin and be difficult to be cut by a cutter, or the<br>
strands may easily be broken before they are led to the<br>
cutter in some cases.<br>
In the particles forming process of the present<br>
invention,.as a method of discharging the molten<br>
polyester into strands, the molten polyester is led to a<br>
die head through e.g. an extruder, a gear pump or a<br><br>
piping connected to a pressurized melt polycondensation<br>
reaction tank and discharged into strands from a single<br>
or a plurality of die holes provided at the tip of the<br>
die head. The hole shape of the die hole may, for<br>
example, be circular, elliptic, polygonal or star, or a<br>
shape of part thereof (e.g. semicircle or semiellipse) or<br>
a shape of combination thereof (e.g. a rectangular shape<br>
with semicircles on both ends). With respect to the size<br>
of the hole of the die hole, the pore diameter is<br>
preferably from 0.7 to 5.0 mm as calculated as the<br>
cfiameter of a circle having the same area as the area of<br>
the hole of the die hole. If it is less than 0.7 mm, the<br>
discharge pressure may be too high, whereby discharge<br>
&gt;5	=	—-<br>
tends to be difficult and the strands are likely to be<br>
broken. Further, if it exceeds 5.0 mm, no appropriate<br>
drawing rate ratio r tends to be achieved, and particles<br>
with a small particle size tend to hardly be obtained.<br>
Further, when the molten polyester is discharged<br>
from the die hole into strands, the linear velocity (vl<br>
(m/s)) of the molten polyester discharged from the die<br>
hole is preferably from 0.1 to 3 m/s. If the linear<br>
velocity of the polyester discharged from the die hole is<br>
less than 0.1 m/s, the drawing rate ratio r tends to be<br>
high and the strands tend to be too thin, whereby they<br>
are unlikely to be cut properly by a cutter. If the<br>
linear velocity exceeds 3 m/s, the drawing rate ratio r<br>
tends to be low and the strands tend to be thick, and<br><br>
particles with a small particle size tend to hardly be<br>
obtained.<br>
Further, the direction of discharge of the molten<br>
polyester when the molten polyester is discharged from<br>
the die hole into strands, is preferably within an angle<br>
formed by the horizontal direction and a direction tilted<br>
downward 70° from the horizontal direction. When the<br>
discharge direction is within this angle, the bending<br>
angle of strands at the point of contact at which the<br>
discharged polyester strands are contacted with the<br>
liquefied fluid is small, and accordingly the strands are<br>
less likely to vibrate, whereby particles can be obtained<br>
stably. The direction of discharge of the molten<br>
polyester is the slope of the tangent line of an arc<br>
drawn by the strands very close to the die plate.<br>
The direction of discharge is preferably within an<br>
angle formed by the horizontal direction and a direction<br>
tilted downward 60°, more preferably an angle formed by<br>
the horizontal direction and a direction tilted downward<br>
50° from the horizontal direction.<br>
In the particles forming process of the present<br>
invention, in the above step (2), the polyester strands<br>
obtained by discharging the molten polyester from the die<br>
hole are brought into contact with a liquefied fluid for<br>
cooling to lead the polyester strands together with the<br>
liquefied fluid to a cutter, and the liquefied fluid is<br>
not particularly limited so long as it is a liquid<br><br>
capable of cooling the strands discharged in a molten<br>
state and capable of traveling together with the strands.<br>
The liquefied fluid is suitably water, which is safely-<br>
handled, with which a product with little foreign matters<br>
is likely to be obtained, and which is available at a low<br>
cost. The linear velocity of the liquefied fluid is<br>
preferably from about 0.5 to about 10 times, more<br>
preferably from 1 to 2 times the linear velocity v2 of<br>
the strands immediately before cut.<br>
The temperature of the liquefied fluid to be used,<br>
e.g. water, is properly selected depending upon the<br>
temperature at the time of melting the polyester, the<br>
melting point, the softening point or the glass<br>
transition point of the polyester, or the angle of<br>
discharge or thickness of the strands, etc., but is at<br>
least 5°C, preferably at least 25°C, and at most 95°C,<br>
preferably at most 90°C. If it is less than 5°C, the<br>
strands will be cooled too rapidly, whereby vibration may<br>
occur due to shrinkage strain, or the strands may have<br>
void therein, and if it exceeds 95°C, cooling tends to be<br>
insufficient, whereby strands may fuse with one another,<br>
or particles after cut may fuse with one another, such<br>
being unfavorable. Particularly when the polyester is a<br>
polyethylene terephthalate, the lower limit of the<br>
temperature of water is preferably 10°C, more preferably<br>
40°C, and the upper limit is preferably 70°C, more<br>
preferably 65°C.<br><br>
In the particles forming process of the present<br>
invention, the polyester strands discharged from the die<br>
hole are contacted with the liquefied fluid, and when<br>
they are contacted, the rectilinear distance between the<br>
outlet of the die hole and the point of contact between<br>
the polyester strands and the liquefied fluid (when water<br>
is used as the liquefied fluid, the point will be<br>
referred to as landing point) is preferably from 10 to<br>
500 mm. When the rectilinear distance is within this<br>
range, the equipment is easily disposed and adjusted,<br>
there will be few problems of vibration of the strands<br>
and breakage of the strands, and the polyester will<br>
stably be formed into strands, and thus particles will<br>
stably be obtained.<br>
Particularly, in order to obtain particles with<br>
preferred shape and particle size described hereinafter,<br>
the lower limit of the rectilinear distance between the<br>
outlet of the die hole and the point of contact between<br>
the polyester strands and the liquefied fluid, is<br>
preferably 100 mm, more preferably 13 0 mm, particularly<br>
preferably 150 mm, and the upper limit is 500 mm. When<br>
the rectilinear distance is within this range, the molten<br>
polyester in the form of strands can be sufficiently<br>
elongated before the strands are brought into contact<br>
with the liquefied fluid, whereby fine polyester<br>
particles with an average particle size of at most 2 mm<br>
will be obtained more stably, such being particularly<br><br>
preferred.<br>
The speed of travel of the liquefied fluid led to<br>
the cutter together with the polyester strands is<br>
determined by e.g. the linear velocity of the strands.<br>
The length of the strands cooling portion (e.g.<br>
water cooling portion) by the liquefied fluid varies<br>
depending upon e.g. the temperature of the discharged<br>
polyester strands and the size of the strands, but is<br>
usually from 0.5 to 10 m. Further, in order to smoothly<br>
lead the strands and the liquefied fluid to a cutter, the<br>
cooling portion preferably inclines at an angle of from<br>
5° to 80°, preferably from 8° to 60°, more preferably from<br>
10° to 45°, whereby the strands will not vibrate and<br>
particles will stably be obtained.<br>
In the above step (3) in the particles forming<br>
process of the present invention, the polyester strands<br>
led to the cutter are cut, and in this step, the<br>
polyester strands should be cooled by the liquefied fluid<br>
to such an extent that they are cuttable.<br>
The polyester to be used for production of small<br>
particles by the particles forming process of the present<br>
invention is not particularly limited so long as it has a<br>
melt viscosity at the time of discharge of from 0.5 Pa-s<br>
to 5 0 Pa-s, but a polyester in a molten state obtained by<br>
subjecting a dicarboxylic acid and/or its ester forming<br>
derivative and a diol to esterification reaction and/or<br>
ester exchange reaction and further conducting melt<br><br>
polycondensation reaction, is preferably used as it is.<br>
The intrinsic viscosity of the polyester to be<br>
formed into particles in the present invention is equal<br>
to the intrinsic viscosity of the polyester strands<br>
discharged from the die hole in a molten state and is<br>
preferably from 0.2 0 to 0.4 0 dL/g. The lower limit is<br>
more preferably 0.25 dL/g, and the upper limit is more<br>
preferably 0.35 dL/g, particularly preferably 0.32 dl/g.<br>
With a polyester with such a degree of polymerization<br>
that the intrinsic viscosity is less than the lower<br>
limit, the melt viscosity when discharged from the die<br>
hole is too low, whereby stable strands are unlikely to<br>
be obtained. If the intrinsic viscosity exceeds the<br>
upper limit, the polyester is difficult to pass through a<br>
die hole with a small size required to obtain polyester<br>
particles with a small particle size, and expensive<br>
equipment will be required to carry out stirring of a<br>
liquid with a high viscosity and reaction in high vacuum<br>
in the above-described melt polycondensation reaction<br>
step, such being unfavorable.<br>
The polyester to be used for the particles forming<br>
process of the present invention is suitably produced by<br>
subjecting a dicarboxylic acid and/or its ester forming<br>
derivative and a diol to esterification reaction and/or<br>
ester exchange reaction and then to melt polycondensation<br>
reaction using a polycondensation catalyst, but the<br>
method is not particularly limited, and basically a known<br><br>
method for producing a polyester can be employed. For<br>
example, such a method may be mentioned that a<br>
dicarboxylic acid component such as terephthalic acid and<br>
a diol component such as ethylene glycol or butylene<br>
glycol are put in a slurry preparation tank and stirred<br>
and mixed to prepare a raw material slurry, which is<br>
subjected to esterification reaction in an esterification<br>
reaction tank under normal pressure to elevated pressure<br>
with heating while distilling water or the like caused by<br>
the reaction off, and a polyester low polymer (oligomer)<br>
as the obtained esterification reaction product is<br>
transferred to a polycondensation reaction tank and<br>
subjected to melt polycondensation reaction using a<br>
polycondensation catalyst under reduced pressure with<br>
heating to obtain a polyester.<br>
In a case where the dicarboxylic acid component is<br>
one having a melting point close to the polycondensation<br>
reaction temperature, e.g. an ester forming derivative of<br>
a dicarboxylic acid such as dimethyl terephthalate, it<br>
may not be formed into a slurry with the diol but may be<br>
melted and then subjected.to ester exchange reaction with<br>
a diol.<br>
A method of carrying out the above reaction may be<br>
any of a continuous method, a batch method and a<br>
semibatch method, or a combination thereof. Further,<br>
each of the esterification reaction tank (or an ester<br>
exchange reaction tank) and the melt polycondensation<br><br>
reaction tank may be single stage or multistage.<br>
The polyester particles obtained by the particles<br>
forming process of the present invention are suitably<br>
used in a process of crystallizing them after granulation<br>
and further conducting solid phase polycondensation.<br>
Thus, the particles forming process of the present<br>
invention is suitably applied to a process for producing<br>
a polyester resin such as a polyethylene terephthalate<br>
resin and/or a polybutylene terephthalate resin by<br>
carrying out such solid phase polycondensation, that is,<br>
a process for producing a polyester resin wherein the<br>
main component of the dicarboxylic acid among the<br>
polyester raw materials is terephthalic acid and/or<br>
dimethyl terephthalate, and the main component of the<br>
diol is ethylene glycol and/or 1,4-butanediol. Here, the<br>
"main component" means that terephthalic acid accounts<br>
for 85 mol% or more of all dicarboxylic acid components<br>
and that ethylene glycol or 1,4-butanediol accounts for<br>
85 mol% or more of all diol components.<br>
In a method for producing the polyester to be used<br>
in the present invention, for the melt polycondensation<br>
reaction, usually a polycondensation catalyst is used.<br>
The polycondensation catalyst to be used is not<br>
particularly limited, and usually a known catalyst as a<br>
polycondensation catalyst for production of a polyester<br>
resin can be used. For example, a germanium compound, an<br>
antimony compound, a titanium compound, a manganese<br><br>
compound, a zinc compound, an aluminum compound, a<br>
tungsten compound or the like may be used, and among<br>
them, preferred is at least one metal compound selected<br>
from a germanium compound, an antimony compound and a<br>
titanium compound.<br>
The molten polyester in the particles forming<br>
process of the present invention may be one obtained by<br>
once solidifying and then remelting the polyester<br>
obtained by the above melt polycondensation reaction<br>
before used as a material for the particles forming<br>
process of the present invention, or may be the polyester<br>
in a molten state obtained by the melt polycondensation<br>
reaction as it is. The method of solidifying the<br>
polyester obtained by the melt polycondensation reaction<br>
is unfavorable since it requires an operation of<br>
pelletizing the polyester at the solidifying step or an<br>
energy for remelting, and it is preferred to obtain a<br>
polyester in a molten state by the melt polycondensation<br>
reaction and using the obtained polyester as a material<br>
to be subjected to the particles forming process of the<br>
present invention as it is.<br>
The polyester obtained by the melt polycondensation<br>
reaction is preferably supplied to a die head connected<br>
to the melt polycondensation reaction tank via a piping<br>
and discharged from a plurality of die holes provided at<br>
the tip of the die. The discharged polyester strands are<br>
formed into particles by the process of the present<br><br>
invention. As the case requires, a gear pump or a filter<br>
may be provided in the piping between the melt<br>
polycondensation reaction tank and the die-head.<br>
Of the polyester particles obtainable by the<br>
particles forming process of the present invention, the<br>
average particle size is preferably at least 0.5 mm, more<br>
preferably at least 0.6 mm, particularly preferably at<br>
least 0.65 mm, and preferably at most 2.0 mm, more<br>
preferably at most 1.8 mm, particularly preferably at<br>
most 1.6 mm. Particles obtained by the production<br>
process of the present invention and having an average<br>
particle size within the above range are more preferred,<br>
since the solid phase polycondensation rate when the<br>
polyester particles are subjected to solid phase<br>
polycondensation is high. The size of the particles is<br>
more preferably the lower limit or above, whereby<br>
troubles are less likely to occur in the subsequent steps<br>
or during air power transport. Further, the size of the<br>
particles is more preferably the upper limit or smaller,<br>
whereby troubles such as breakage or formation of dust<br>
will hardly occur at the time of granulation, and the<br>
time for the solid phase polycondensation reaction<br>
required to achieve a desired molecular weight can be<br>
shortened.<br>
The average particle size of the particles is a<br>
value at the cumulative percentage of 50% in a cumulative<br>
distribution curve prepared by the dry sieving method as<br><br>
stipulated in JIS K0069.<br>
The polyester particles obtained by the particles<br>
forming process of the present invention preferably have<br>
a substantially cylindroid shape. The "substantially<br>
cylindroid shape" includes a cylindroid, quadrangular<br>
prism and an intermediate thereof. The "cylindroid" is a<br>
prism having an elliptic cut surface, and the<br>
"quadrangular prism" is a prism having a rectangular cut<br>
surface. Further, the "intermediate thereof" is a prism<br>
having a cut surface of a shape inscribed in a<br>
rectangular having a long side and a short side equal to<br>
the major axis and the short axis of the cut surface,<br>
e.g. a shape inscribed in a rectangular lacking at least<br>
part of four corners in the arc shape, and in the present<br>
invention, it is expressed as a "a cylindroid<br>
substantially close to a quadrangular prism" or a "a<br>
cylindroid close to a shape having semicircles imparted<br>
to both ends of a quadrangular prism" or the like. The<br>
polyester particles of the present invention having the<br>
above shape are preferred in that the specific surface<br>
area (surface area/volume) of the particles is large,<br>
whereby the solid phase polycondensation rate is<br>
relatively high.<br>
A preferred shape of the polyester particles<br>
obtainable by the particles forming process of the<br>
present invention is a substantial cylindroid having the<br>
size described below. That is, the length is at least<br><br>
0.5 mm and at most 2.5 mm, more preferably at most 2 mm,<br>
particularly preferably at most 1.5 mm. Further, the cut<br>
surface has a major axis of at least 0.5 mm and at most<br>
2.5 mm, more preferably at most 2 mm, particularly<br>
preferably at most 1.5 mm, and a short axis of at least<br>
0.3 mm and at most 2 mm, more preferably at most 1.5 mm,<br>
particularly preferably at most 1.2 mm.<br>
Preferred polyester particles are ones having an<br>
intrinsic viscosity of from 0.20 to 0.40 dL/g, a length<br>
of from 0.5 to 2.5 mm, having a cut surface with a major<br>
axis and a short axis of from. 0.5 to 2.5 mm and from 0.3<br>
to 2 mm, respectively, and having a substantially<br>
cylindroid shape.<br>
Particularly preferred polyester particles are ones<br>
having a length of from 0.5 to 1.5 mm, having a cut<br>
surface with a major axis and a short axis of from 0.5 to<br>
1.5 mm and from 0.3 to 1.2 mm, respectively, and having a<br>
substantially cylindroid shape. Such a shape is<br>
advantageous in production of a polyester resin, since<br>
the specific surface area of the particles tends to be<br>
large, whereby the solid phase polycondensation rate is<br>
relatively high as compared with cylindrical particles as<br>
disclosed in Patent Document 6.<br>
The polyester particles obtained by the particles<br>
forming process of the present invention are preferably<br>
further subjected to solid phase polycondensation, and<br>
particularly .when polyester resin_ p_a_rti£.les having<br><br>
crystallinity are desired, the polyester particles are<br>
subjected to a solid phase polycondensation step thereby<br>
to produce polyester resin particles with a higher degree<br>
of polymerization. Polyester resin particles thus<br>
produced are polyester resin particles having more<br>
favorable physical properties in view of moldability,<br>
mechanical and physical properties of a molded product to<br>
be obtained, etc.<br>
The polyester particles of the present invention,<br>
for example, the polyester particles obtained by the<br>
above particles forming process, are subjected to a solid<br>
phase polycondensation step to produce polyester resin<br>
particles, and a specific method of the solid phase<br>
polycondensation is not particularly limited, and various<br>
methods may be employed according to need. As a known<br>
method, a method may be mentioned wherein the polyester<br>
particles are fluidized in an inert gas stream at from<br>
12 0 to 18 0°C for from 0.5 to 12 hours to carry out<br>
crystallization and drying treatment, and then solid<br>
phase polycondensation is continuously carried out in a<br>
moving bed while flowing an inert gas usually at a<br>
temperature of 180°C or above and a temperature lower by<br>
5°C than the melting point of the polyester. The solid<br>
phase polycondensation time is set depending on the<br>
intrinsic viscosity of the aimed polyester resin and is<br>
usually from about 1 to about 50 hours. With respect to<br>
the intrinsic viscosity after the solid phase<br><br>
polycondensation, the lower limit is usually 0.70 dL/g,<br>
preferably 0.72 dL/g, more preferably 0.74 dL/g, and the<br>
upper limit is usually 1.50 dL/g, preferably 1.45 dL/g,<br>
more preferably 1.40 dL/g. When the intrinsic viscosity<br>
of the polyester resin particles obtained by the<br>
production process of the present invention is within<br>
this range, a molded product obtained from such polyester<br>
resin particles is excellent in mechanical strength and<br>
melt moldability, such being more favorable.<br>
Particularly, in production of a polyester resin by<br>
the solid phase polycondensation in the present<br>
invention, it is preferred to subject polyester particles<br>
having particularly preferred size and shape obtained by<br>
the above-described particles-forming process of the<br>
present invention to solid phase polycondensation. In<br>
such a case, slight shrinkage or the like by<br>
crystallization will occur, but the polyester resin after<br>
the solid phase polycondensation is a polyester resin<br>
having an intrinsic viscosity of at least 0.70 dL/g, in<br>
the form of the most preferred particles having a<br>
substantially cylindroid shape having a length of from<br>
0.5 mm to 1.5 mm and a cut surface with a major axis and<br>
a minor axis of from 0.5 mm to 1.5 mm and from 0.3 mm to<br>
1.2 mm, respectively. The polyester resin having such<br>
size and shape of the present invention is more preferred<br>
in that solid phase polycondensation for production<br>
thereof is carried out in a short time and the melting<br><br>
time when the polyester resin of the present invention is<br>
subjected to thermoforming is short.<br>
The polyester resin particles to be produced by the<br>
solid phase polycondensation method of the present<br>
invention are excellent in mechanical strength and melt<br>
moldability, and are suitably used for bottles to be<br>
filled with a beverage, by molding a preform by injection<br>
molding or extrusion, followed by orientation blow<br>
molding. Further, the polyester resin particles can be<br>
formed into a bottle also by direct blow molding.<br>
Further, the polyester resin particles can be<br>
suitably used for various applications such as a<br>
packaging material by forming them into a film or a sheet<br>
by injection molding or orientation molding, and can be<br>
suitably used as fibers by extrusion/orientation molding.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Now, the present invention will be described in<br>
further detail with reference to Examples, but the<br>
present invention is by no means restricted to the<br>
following Examples.<br>
Methods of evaluating physical properties in the<br>
present invention are as follows.<br>
(Intrinsic viscosity)<br>
About 0.25 g of a sample (polymer) was dissolved in<br>
about 25 mL of a solvent mixer of phenol/1,1,2,2-<br>
tetrachloroethane (weight ratio l/l) at 140°C so that the<br><br>
concentration became l.OOxlO"2 kg/L. Then, the solution<br>
was cooled to 3 0°C, and the number of seconds during<br>
falling of the sample solution at a concentration of<br>
l.OOxlCT2 kg/L and the solvent alone was measured by an<br>
automatic solution viscometer ("2CH model DJ504"<br>
manufactured by SENTEC Corporation) to calculate the<br>
intrinsic viscosity in accordance with the following<br>
formula:<br>
[n] = [(1 + 4KHrisp)0-5-l]/(200KHC)<br>
wherein nSP = n/n0-l, r| is the number of seconds during<br>
falling of the sample solution, n0 is the number of<br>
seconds during falling of the solvent, C is the polymer<br>
solution concentration (kg/L), and KH is the Huggins<br>
constant, provided that KH = 0.33 was employed.<br>
(Melt viscosity)<br>
A sample was vacuum dried at 12 0°C for 14 hours, and<br>
a test piece with a diameter of 25 mm and a thickness of<br>
2 mm was prepared at a temperature of 280°C by using a<br>
pressing machine ("MINI PRESS" manufactured by Toyo Seiki<br>
Seisaku-sho Ltd.). The sample was stored in a desiccator<br>
immediately before measurement.<br>
As a measuring apparatus, a dynamic viscoelasticity<br>
measuring apparatus ("ARES10 0 model" manufactured by TA<br>
Instruments) was used, and the detector was a full scale<br>
10 g type. As a measuring jig, parallel plates with a<br>
diameter of 25 mm were used, and the plate distance was<br>
1.5 mm. The measuring operation was as follows.<br><br>
A heating oven was heated to the measurement<br>
temperature, the sample was inserted between parallel<br>
plates and the heating oven was closed, and upon<br>
confirmation of the sample being melted, the upper plate<br>
was let down and closely contacted to the sample, and the<br>
sample was pressed to a plate distance of 1.5 mm.<br>
Then, the heating oven was opened, the sample<br>
spilled from the plates was removed and the heating oven<br>
was closed again, the plate distance was set at 1.50 mm,<br>
and upon confirmation of the temperature being stabilized<br>
at the measurement temperature, measurement was started.<br>
The strain at the time of measurement was 30%. Further,<br>
the time from insertion of the sample to the beginning of<br>
measurement was set to 8 minutes. ,<br>
In such a manner, the complex viscosity at a<br>
temperature of the molten polyester when discharged from<br>
a die hole at a shear rate of 10 rad/s was measured and<br>
regarded as the melt viscosity.<br>
(Average particle size)<br>
Measured in accordance with a dry sieving test<br>
method as stipulated in JIS K0069.<br>
A polyester to be subjected to production of<br>
polyester particles in Examples 1 to 6 and Comparative<br>
Example 1 was produced as follows.<br>
(Production of polyester)<br>
A polyester with a low degree of polymerization to<br>
be subjected to strand cutting was produced by using a<br><br>
polyester continuous production apparatus equipped with a<br>
slurry preparation tank having a stirrer, an ethylene<br>
glycol charge piping and a terephthalic acid charge<br>
piping; a piping which transfers a slurry to a first<br>
esterification tank; complete mixing type first and<br>
second esterification reaction tanks having a stirrer, a<br>
separation column, a material receiver, a catalyst charge<br>
piping and a reaction product transfer piping; a piping<br>
which transfers an esterification reaction product<br>
(oligomer) to a melt polycondensation reaction tank; a<br>
complete mixing type first melt polycondensation reaction<br>
tank having a stirrer, a separation column, an oligomer<br>
receiver and a catalyst charge piping; plug flow type<br>
second and third melt polycondensation reaction tanks<br>
having a stirrer, a separation column and a polymer<br>
receiver; and a polyester discharge piping. A specific<br>
method was as follows.<br>
(Polyester A: material A)<br>
In the slurry preparation tank, a terephthalic<br>
acid/ethylene glycol (molar ratio 1:1.5) slurry having<br>
orthophosphoric acid added thereto so that the phosphorus<br>
concentration in a polyester to be obtained became 22<br>
wtppm as phosphorous atoms, was prepared. Further, 4 00<br>
parts by weight of bis-(beta-hydroxyethyl)terephthalate<br>
was charged in the first esterification tank and melted<br>
in a nitrogen atmosphere, and in the first tank<br>
maintained at a temperature of 262°C under a pressure of<br><br>
96 kPaG (hereinafter G represents the relative pressure<br>
to the atmospheric pressure), the above slurry prepared<br>
in the slurry preparation tank was continuously charged<br>
at a rate of 13 5 parts by weight/hour so that the average<br>
retention time as the polyester became. 4.5 hours, to<br>
carry out esterification reaction while distilling formed<br>
water off from the separation column, and the reaction<br>
liquid was continuously transferred to the second<br>
esterification reaction tank.<br>
In the second esterification reaction tank,<br>
esterification reaction was carried out by continuously<br>
adding an ethylene glycol solution of antimony trioxide<br>
(concentration: 1.8 wt% as the antimony atom<br>
concentration) so that the antimony concentration in a<br>
polyester to be obtained became 183 wtppm as antimony<br>
atoms, at a temperature of 2 60°C under a pressure of 5<br>
kPaG for a retention time of 1.5 hours, and the product<br>
was continuously transferred to the complete mixing type<br>
first melt polycondensation reaction tank through the<br>
transfer piping. In the first melt polycondensation<br>
reaction tank, reaction was carried out under a pressure<br>
of 2.5 kPaA (hereinafter A represents the absolute<br>
pressure) of the polycondensation reaction tank at a<br>
temperature of 273°C for a retention time of 1.0 hour,<br>
and the obtained polyester was taken through the<br>
discharge piping in the middle of the transfer piping to<br>
the second melt polycondensation reaction tank and cooled<br><br>
and solidified.<br>
The intrinsic viscosity of the obtained polyester<br>
was 0.215 dL/g.<br>
The cooled and solidified polyester was made to pass<br>
through two stainless steel rolls having axes of rotation<br>
in parallel with each other, disposed to be close to each<br>
other, having irregularities on the surface and rotating<br>
in different directions four times to compress and<br>
pulverize the polyester to obtain irregular polyester<br>
particles having a particle size within a range of from<br>
0.1 mm to 3.36 mm. The irregular polyester particles<br>
will be referred to as "material A".<br>
(Polyester B: material B)<br>
The reaction up to the first melt polycondensation<br>
reaction tank was carried out in the same manner as in<br>
the above method for producing the material A, and the<br>
obtained polyester was transferred to the second melt<br>
polycondensation reaction tank. In the second melt<br>
polycondensation reaction tank, melt polycondensation<br>
reaction was carried out under a pressure of 2.0 kPaA at<br>
a temperature of 280°C for a retention time of 1.0 hours,<br>
and the obtained polyester was transferred to the third<br>
melt polycondensation reaction tank through the transfer<br>
piping. In the third melt polycondensation reaction<br>
tank, melt polycondensation reaction was carried out<br>
under a pressure of 1.5 kPaA at a temperature of 280°C<br>
for a retention time of 1.2 hours. The obtained<br><br>
polyester was drawn and led to a die head through the<br>
discharge piping and taken out from the die hole in the<br>
form of strands, which were cooled with water and<br>
solidified and then cut by a cutter to obtain polyester<br>
particles having an intrinsic viscosity of 0.403 dL/g and<br>
an average particle size of 3 mm. The polyester<br>
particles will be referred to as "material B".<br>
(Formation of polyester into particles)<br>
The material A and the material B obtained by the<br>
above methods were put in an inert oven through which<br>
nitrogen flowed, dried at a temperature of 180°C for 3<br>
hours and mixed in a predetermined ratio as identified in<br>
Table 1, and the mixture was supplied to a twin screw<br>
extruder of 45 mm in diameter and discharged from a die<br>
plate at a resin temperature of 2 80°C into strands. The<br>
polyester strands were formed into particles by a strand<br>
cutting method using a pelletizer (P-USG200) manufactured<br>
by Rieter Automatik GmbH. That is, the polyester strands<br>
were transferred to a cutter while bringing it into<br>
contact with water at a predetermined temperature and<br>
cooling it together with water, and on that occasion, the<br>
polyester strands were sandwiched between a pair of<br>
drawing rolls disposed before the cutter and drawn and<br>
then supplied to the cutter and cut by cutter having a<br>
fixed blade and a rotary blade to obtain polyester<br>
particles. The length of the water cooling portion was 2<br>
mm, the slant at the water cooling portion was 20° to the<br><br>
horizontal direction, and the rotary blade was one having<br>
6 0 cogs.<br>
Operation conditions such as the linear velocity of<br>
the strands being discharged and the drawing rate ratio<br>
in each Example are shown in Table 1.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Material A was continuously supplied to an extruder<br>
at a rate of 4 8 kg/hour and melted, and discharged from a<br>
die plate with 6 circular die holes of 2 mm in diameter<br>
at a resin temperature of 280°C into strands. The<br>
direction of discharge was at an angle of 45° downward<br>
from the horizontal direction. The linear velocity of<br>
the polyester being discharged is 0.58 m/sec calculated<br>
assuming that the density of the polyester at a resin<br>
temperature of 28 0°C was 1.23 kg/L.<br>
The polyester strands were landed on a cooling zone<br>
of a strand cutter in such a state that the rectilinear<br>
distance between the outlet of the die hole and the point<br>
of contact between the polyester strands and water<br>
(landing point) (hereinafter the linear distance will be<br>
referred to as an "air cooling distance") became 140 mm,<br>
and transferred while being cooled with water at 50°C,<br>
drawn by drawing rolls and supplied to a cutter. The<br>
strand drawing rate was 2.33 m/sec, and the drawing rate<br>
ratio was 4.0. Formation into particles was carried out<br>
by adjusting the ratio of the number of revolutions of<br>
the drawing rolls to the rotary blade of the cutter so<br><br>
that the length of the particles in the drawing direction<br>
became 1.5 mm.<br>
As a result, polyester particles having a cylindroid<br>
shape substantially close to a quadrangular prism, having<br>
a length of 1.5 mm and a cut surface with a major axis<br>
and a minor axis of 1.5 mm and 0.7 mm, respectively, were<br>
obtained. The average particle size of the particles was<br>
1.5 mm. The amount of irregular particles which did not<br>
pass through a sieve with an opening of 2.8 mm, formed in<br>
the particles forming step, was 3 wt%. Further, the melt<br>
viscosity of the particles at 280°C was 1.7 Pa-s, and the<br>
intrinsic viscosity was 0.205 dL/g. The operation<br>
conditions and the results are shown in Table 1.<br>

major axis and a minor axis of 1.4 mm and 0.7 mm,<br>
respectively, were obtained. The average particle size<br>
of the particles was 1.5 mm. The amount of irregular<br>
particles which did not pass through a sieve with an<br>
opening of 2.8 mm, formed in the particles forming step,<br>
was 2 wt%. The operation conditions and the results are<br>
shown in Table 1.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>

major axis and a minor axis of 1.4 mm and 0.9 mm,<br>
respectively, were obtained. The average particle size<br>
of the particles was 1.5 mm. The amount of irregular<br>
particles which did not pass through a sieve with an<br>

EXAMPLE 5<br>
Formation into particles was carried out in the same<br>
manner as in Example 1 except that the die plate was<br>

that the number of revolutions of the rotary blade of the<br>
cutter was adjusted so that the length of the particles<br>
in the drawing direction became 1.25 mm, and that the<br>
operation conditions were as identified in Table 1. As a<br>

of irregular particles and uncut strands formed, and<br>
stable granulation could not be carried out. The<br>
operation conditions and the results are shown in Table<br><br>

EXAMPLE 6<br>
The polyester particles obtained in Example 5 were<br>
put in an inert oven through which nitrogen flowed,<br>
crystallized at a temperature of 180°C for 2 hours and<br>
then subjected to solid phase polycondensation at 230°C<br>
for 12 hours to obtain polyester particles having a high<br>
molecular weight. The particles had a cylindroid shape<br>
substantially close to a quadrangular prism having a<br>
length of 1.2 mm and a cut surface with a major axis and<br>
a minor axis of 1.2 mm and 0.8 mm, respectively, and had<br>
an intrinsic viscosity of 0.845 dL/g.<br><br><br><br>
EXAMPLE 7<br>
Using the polyester continuous production apparatus<br>
used in the above (Production of polyester),<br>
esterification reaction of a dicarboxylic acid and a diol<br>
was carried out and further melt polycondensation<br>
reaction was carried out to obtain a polyester in a<br>
molten state, and the obtained polyester in a molten<br>
state was used for production of particles as it was to<br>
produce polyester particles with a low degree of<br>
polymerization. A specific method was as follows.<br>
In the slurry preparation tank, a terephthalic<br>
acid/ethylene glycol (molar ratio 1:1.5) slurry<br>
containing tetra-n-butyl titanate in an amount of 8 wtppm<br>
as titanium based on a polyester to be obtained, was<br>
prepared. Further, 400 parts by weight of bis-(beta-<br>
hydroxyethyl)terephthalate was charged to the first<br>
esterification tank and melted in a nitrogen atmosphere,<br>
and to the first esterification tank maintained at a<br>
temperature of 262°C under a pressure of 96 kPaG, the<br>
above slurry prepared in the slurry preparation tank was<br>
continuously charged at a rate of 135 parts by<br>
weight/hour so that the average retention time as a<br>
polyester became 4.5 hours to carry out esterification<br>
reaction while distilling formed water off from the<br>
separation column, and the reaction liquid was<br>
continuously transferred to the second esterification<br>
reaction tank.<br><br>
In the second esterification reaction tank,<br>
esterification reaction was carried out at a temperature<br>
of 260°C under a pressure of 5 kPaG for a retention time<br>
of 1.5 hours, and the reaction product was continuously<br>
transferred to the complete mixing type first melt<br>
polycondensation reaction tank through the transfer<br>
piping.<br>
In the first melt polycondensation reaction tank,<br>
reaction was carried out at a temperature of 270°C under<br>
a pressure of 4.0 kPaA for a retention time of 1.0 hour,<br>
and the reaction product was continuously transferred to<br>
the second melt polycondensation reaction tank through<br>
the transfer piping. In the second melt polycondensation<br>
reaction tank, melt polycondensation reaction was carried<br>
out at a temperature of 270°C under a pressure of 4.0<br>
kPaA for a retention time of 1.0 hour, and the reaction<br>
product was transferred to the third melt<br>
polycondensation reaction tank through the transfer<br>
piping. In the third melt polycondensation reaction<br>
tank, melt polycondensation reaction was carried out at a<br>
temperature of 270°C under a pressure of 4.0 kPaA for a<br>
retention time of 1.2 hours.<br>
The molten polyester thus obtained was led to the<br>
die head through the gear pump and the discharge piping<br>
as it was, discharged from the die hole into strands,<br>
which are cooled with water and formed into particles by<br>
a pelletizer (P-USG100) manufactured by Rieter Automatik<br><br>
GmbH. The particles forming process was a strand cutting<br>
method, and specifically, the polyester strands were<br>
transferred to the cutter direction together with water<br>
while bringing the polyester strands into contact with<br>
water and cooling them, sandwiched between a pair of<br>
drawing rolls disposed before the cutter and drawn and<br>
supplied to the cutter, and cut by the cutter having a<br>
fixed blade and a rotary blade to obtain polyester<br>
particles. The water cooling length was 2 mm, the slant<br>
at the water cooling portion was 20° to the horizontal<br>
plane, and the rotary blade was one having 6 0 cogs.<br>
The amount of discharge of the molten polyester was<br>
12 6 kg/hour, the temperature was set at 270°C, and the<br>
polyester was discharged from a die plate having 4<br>
circular die holes of 3 mm in the direction of discharge<br>
at an angle of 4 5° downward from the horizontal<br>
direction, into strands. The linear velocity of the<br>
polyester being discharged is 1.01 m/sec calculated<br>
assuming that the density of the polyester at a resin<br>
temperature of 270°C was 1.23 kg/L.<br>
The polyester strands were landed on a cooling zone<br>
(water cooling portion) of the strand cutter in a state<br>
where the air cooling distance became 170 mm, transferred<br>
while cooling with water at 50°C, drawn by drawing rolls<br>
and supplied to the cutter. The strands drawing rate was<br>
3.00 m/sec, and the drawing rate ratio was 3.0.<br>
Formation into particles was carried out by adjusting the<br><br>
ratio of the number of revolutions of the drawing rolls<br>
to the rotary blade of the cutter so that the length of<br>
the particles in the drawing direction became 1.0 mm.<br>
As a result, polyester particles having a cylindroid<br>
shape substantially close to a shape having semicircles<br>
imparted to both ends of a quadrangular prism, having a<br>
length of 1.0 mm and a cut surface with a major axis and<br>
a minor axis of 1.9 mm and 1.3 mm, respectively, were<br>
obtained. The average particle size of the particles was<br>
1.8 mm. The amount of irregular particles which did not<br>
pass through a sieve with an opening of 2.8 mm formed in<br>
the particles forming step was 0.02 wt%. Further, the<br>
melt viscosity of the particles at 270°C was 9.1 Pa-s,<br>
and the intrinsic viscosity was 0.290 dL/g. The<br>
operation conditions and the results are shown in Table<br>
2.<br>
EXAMPLE 8<br>
Formation of the polyester into particles was<br>
carried out in the same manner as in Example 7 except<br>
that the operation conditions were changed as identified<br>
in Table 2 by changing the amount of discharge of the<br>
molten polyester to 98 kg/hour. As a result, polyester<br>
particles having a cylindroid shape substantially close<br>
to a shape having semicircles imparted to both ends of a<br>
quadrangular prism, having a length of 1.0 mm and a cut<br>
surface with a major axis and a minor axis of 1.6 mm and<br>
1.2 mm, respectively, were obtained. The average<br><br>
particle size of the particles was 1.5 mm. The amount of<br>
irregular particles which did not pass through a sieve<br>
with an opening of 2.8 mm, formed in the particles<br>
forming step, was 0.01 wt%. The operation conditions and<br>
the results are shown in Table 2.<br>
EXAMPLE 9<br>
Formation of the polyester into particles was<br>
carried out in the same manner as in Example 7 except<br>
that the operation conditions were changed as identified<br>
in Table 2 by changing the amount of discharge of the<br>
molten polyester to 61 kg/hour. As a result, polyester<br>
particles having a cylindroid shape substantially close<br>
to a shape having semicircles imparted to both ends of a<br>
quadrangular prism, having a length of 1.0 mm and a cut<br>
surface with a major axis and a minor axis of 1.3 mm and<br>
0.9 mm, respectively, were obtained. The average<br>
particle size of the particles was 1.3 mm. The amount of<br>
irregular particles which did not pass through a sieve<br>
with an opening of 2.8 mm, formed in the particles<br>
forming step, was 0.01 wt%. The operation conditions and<br>
the results are shown in Table 2.<br>
EXAMPLE 10<br>
Formation of the polyester into particles was<br>
carried out in the same manner as in Example 7 except<br>
that the operation conditions were changed as identified<br>
in Table 2. As a result, polyester particles having a<br>
cylindroid shape substantially close to a shape having<br><br>
semicircles imparted to both ends of a quadrangular<br>
prism, having a length of 1.0 mm and a cut surface with a<br>
major axis and a minor axis of 2.5 mm and 1.8 mm,<br>
respectively, were obtained. The average particle size<br>
of the particles was 2.2 mm. The amount of irregular<br>
particles which did not pass through a sieve with an<br>
opening of 2.8 mm, formed in the particles forming step,<br>
was 0.03 wt%. The operation conditions and the results<br>
are shown in Table 2.<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 2<br>
Formation of the polyester into particles was<br>
attempted in the same manner as in Example 7 except that<br>
the operation conditions were changed as identified in<br>
Table 2. As a result, since strands wound, in addition<br>
to polyester particles having a cylindroid shape<br>
substantially close to a shape having semicircles<br>
imparted to both ends of a quadrangular prism, having a<br>
length of 1.0 mm and a cut surface with a major axis and<br>
a minor axis of 3.1 mm and 1.9 mm, particles cut at a<br>
slant and irregular particles with a length of 10 mm or<br>
longer were obtained. The amount of irregular particles<br>
which did not pass through a sieve with an opening of 2.8<br>
mm was 4 wt%. The operation conditions and the results<br>
are shown in Table 2.<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 3<br>
Formation of the polyester into particles was<br>
attempted in the same manner as in Example 7 except that<br><br>
the direction of discharge of the molten polyester was<br>
changed to an angle (vertical downward) of 90° downward<br>
from the horizontal direction, that the air cooling<br>
distance of the polyester strands was changed to 5 8 mm,<br>
that the temperature of the cooling water was changed to<br>
20°C, that the strands drawing rate was changed to 1.00<br>
m/sec to change the drawing rate ratio to 1.0, that the<br>
length of the particles in the drawing direction was<br>
changed to 3.0 mm, and that the operation conditions were<br>
changed as identified in Table 2. As a result, since<br>
strands wound, in addition to cylindrical polyester<br>
particles having a length of 3.0 mm and a cut surface<br>
with a diameter of 3.0 mm, crushed particles, particles<br>
cut at a slant, and irregular particles having a length<br>
of 10 mm or longer were obtained. The amount of such<br>
irregular particles formed was 10 wt%. Further, most of<br>
the obtained particles had bubbles in their inside,<br>
probably because the cooling water temperature was low<br>
and the strands were thick. The operation conditions and<br>
the results are shown in Table 2.<br>
EXAMPLE 11<br>
Formation of the polyester into particles was<br>
carried out in the same manner as in Example 7 except<br>
that the temperature of the second and third melt<br>
polycondensation reaction tanks was changed to 275°C so<br>
that the temperature of the molten polyester at the time .<br>
of discharge became 275°C, that the die plate was changed<br><br>
to one having 10 die holes, that the amount of the molten<br>
polyester discharged was changed to 78 kg/hour, and that<br>
the operation conditions were changed as identified in<br>
Table 2. As a result, polyester particles having a<br>
cylindroid shape substantially close to a shape having<br>
semicircles imparted to both ends of a rectangular prism,<br>
having a length of 1.0 mm and a cut surface with a major<br>
axis and a minor axis of 1.0 mm and 0.7 mm, respectively,<br>
were obtained. The average particle size of the<br>
particles was 1.0 mm. The amount of irregular particles<br>
which did not pass through a sieve with an opening of 2.8<br>
mm, formed in the particles forming step, was 0.03 wt%.<br>
The operation conditions and the results are shown in<br>
Table 2.<br>
EXAMPLE 12<br>
The polyester particles obtained in Example 9 were<br>
charged to an inert oven through which nitrogen flowed,<br>
crystallized at a temperature of 180°C for 2 hours and<br>
subsequently subjected to solid phase polycondensation at<br>
23 0°C for 12 hours to obtain polyester particles having a<br>
high molecular weight. The particles had a cylindroid<br>
shape substantially close to a shape having semicircles<br>
imparted to both ends of a quadrangular prism, having a<br>
length of 0.9 mm and a cut surface with a major axis and<br>
a minor axis of 1.3 mm and 0.9 mm, respectively, and had<br>
an intrinsic viscosity of 0.866 dL/g.<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 4<br><br>
Among polyester particles obtained in Comparative<br>
Example 3, particles having a relatively good shape were<br>
selected and charged to an inert oven through which<br>
nitrogen flowed and crystallized at a temperature of<br>
180°C for 2 hours. As a result, most of the particles<br>
burst by the influence of the bubbles in their inside and<br>
became irregular particles. The particles obtained in<br>
Comparative Example 3 were particles unsuitable for solid<br>
phase polycondensation.<br><br><br><br>
