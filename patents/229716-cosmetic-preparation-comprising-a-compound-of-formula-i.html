The present invention relates to the use of aminophenylbenzothiazole compounds as UV filters, especially for protecting human and animal hair and skin from UV radiation, to processes for the preparation of those compounds and to cosmetic preparations comprising those compounds.<br>
The present invention relates to the use, as UV filters, of compounds of formula<br><br>
R1 and R2 are each independently of the other hydrogen; unsubstituted or halo-, amino-, mono- or di-C1-C6alkylamino-, cyano- or C1-Csalkoxy-substituted C1-C22alkyl, C5-C10cycloalkyI, carboxy-C1-C22alkyl, carboxy-C6-C10aryl, Ce-Cioaryl or C6-C10aryl-C1-Csalkyl; carbamoyl; or sulfamoyl; or<br>

C6-C10AryJ and heteroaryl radicals may be unsubstltuted or may caR1y one or more, for example one, two, three or four, identical or different substituents, which may be located in any positions. Examples of such substituents are, e.g., C1-C4alkyl, halogen, hydroxy, C1-C4alkoxy, trifluoromethyl, cyano, hydroxycarbonyl, C1-C4alkoxycarbonyl, aminocarbonyl, amino, C1-C4alkylamino, di-C1-C4alkylamino and C1-C4alkylcarbonylamino.<br>
Halogen is fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine, preferably fluorine or chlorine.<br>
In accordance with the invention, preference is given to the use of UV filters of fonnula (1)<br>
wherein<br>
R4   is hydrogen.<br><br>
Preference is given especially to compounds of formula (1) wherein R1 and R2 are each independently of the other hydrogen; or d-C12alkyl unsubstituted or substituted by halogen, amino, mono- ordi-C1-Qalkylamino, cyano or by C1-C5alkoxy; and R3   is hydrogen; or C1-Csalkyl.<br>
Special preference is given to compounds of formula (1) wherein<br>
Ri and R2 are each independently of the other hydrogen; or C1-Ciaalkyl; or<br>
Ri and R2 together form a 5- to 7-membered heterocyclic radical;<br>
R3   is hydrogen; or C1-CsalkyI; and<br>
R4   is hydrogen.<br>
Very special preference is given to compounds of formula (1) wherein<br>
Ri   is hydrogen;<br>
R2   is C1-C12alkyl;<br>
R3   is hydrogen; or C1-C5alkyI; and<br>
R4   is hydrogen;<br>
and especially to compounds of formula (1) wherein<br>
R2   is branched or unbranched C6-C12alkyI; very especially n-hexyl; n-octyl; or 2-ethylhexyl.<br>
Very special preference is also given to compounds of formula (1) wherein R4   is hydroxy.<br>
Examples of compounds used in accordance with the Invention are listed in Table 1, which follows:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Aminophenylbenzothiazole compounds are known in the literature and some are commercially available.<br>
The compounds of formula (1) according to the invention can be prepared, for example, by<br>
condensation of Ra-substituted o-amino-thiophenols of fomnula   Rj-jJ-   I        with R1, R2-<br>
and R4 -substituted p-amino-benzaldehydes, where appropriate in the presence of an oxidising agent [R.C. Elderfield, "Heterocyclic Compounds", Vol. 5, 508 ff, O. Sus et aJ, US Patent 3 257 204 (1966), HP. Lankelma et a/, J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 54, 379, (1932) or Stephens ef a/., J. Chem. Soc. (1950) 1722].<br><br>
Condensation of o-amino-thiophenols with Ri- and Ra-substituted p-aminobenzoic acids in accordance with LC. Galatis, J. Amer. Chem. See. 70, 1967 (1948) also yields compounds of the general formula (1).<br>
The benzothiazole compounds of the general formula (1) wherein R, is hydrogen and R2 is an unsubstituted or substituted aralkyi radical are obtained by reaction of F^-substituted 2-{4'-aminophenyO-benzothiazoles with unsubstituted or substituted benzaldehydes to fomn the coR1esponding azomethines, which may be hydrogenated very simply using sodium boronate in polar solvents to form the coR1esponding 2-{4'-benzylaminophenyl)benzothiazole derivatives [J. H. Billmann et a/., J. OR2. Chem. 22, 1068, (1957)].<br>
The benzothiazole compounds of the general formula (1) wherein R, and/or R2 is/are an unsubstituted or substituted alkyl or aralkyi radical can also be prepared by direct alkylation of commercially available 2-{4-aminophenyl)-6-methylbenzothiazole. As alkylating agents there can be used, analogously to DE-OS-51738, the appropriate alcohols under the action of strong acids.<br>
The compounds of formula (1) according to the invention wherein Ri is hydrogen are prepared from Ra-substituted 2-{4-aminophenyl)-benzothiazole by alkylation with the appropriate haloalkanes/haloaralkanes using a base, in accordance with the following Scheme:<br><br>
wherein R2, R3 and R4 are as defined in claim 1.<br>
The compounds of fonnula (1) wherein Ri and R2 are alkyl or aryl-alkyi are prepared from R3-substituted 2-(4-aminophenyl)-benzothiazole by alkylation with the appropriate haloal¬kanes/haloaralkanes using a base, in accordance with the following Scheme:<br><br><br>
As base there may be used a metal hydride, such as sodium hydride, an alkali metal alcohoiate such as, for example, sodium methanoiate, sodium ethanoiate or potassium tert-butanolate, or an alkali metal hydroxide, such as sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, an amine base, such as EtsN, (isoprop)2EtN or quinalidine etc.. Likewise, basic ion exchangers may also be used. The reaction may also be caR1ied out without the addition of base.<br>
The reaction is preferably caR1ied out in dimethyl sulfoxide, N-methylpyR1olidone, dimethyl-formamide or dimethylacetamide, but protic solvents, such as methanol, ethanol, isobutanol, tert-butanol or isopropanol, are also possible. In addition, the reaction may also be caR1ied out in aliphatic or aromatic solvents, such as hexane, toluene or xylene. Ethers, such as diethyl ether and tetrahydrofuran, or halogenated solvents, such as chloroform or dichloromethane, are also possible. Likewise, solvent mixtures may also be used.<br>
The reaction may be caR1ied out at temperatures between -TS^C and the boiling point of the reaction mixture, preferably proceeding at from 10 to 120'C.<br>
Usually a laR2e excess of alkylating agent is used and alkylating agent remaining after the reaction is removed by vacuum distillation. Preference is given to the use of from 1.0 to 8.0 mol of the haloalkane/haloaralkane, based on 1 mol of aminophenylbenzothiazole.<br>
The products are purified by reC1-ystallisation from a suitable solvent or by column-chromato-graphic separation using a suitable eluant.<br>
The invention relates also to the process for the preparation of compounds of fonnula(1).<br><br>
	^,..^.v.vJMuo ui me rormuia (1) according to the present invention are particularly suitable<br>
as UV filters, i.e. for protecting ultraviolet-sensitive oR2anic materials, in particular the skin and hair of humans and animals, from the harmful effects of UV radiation. These compounds are therefore suitable as sunsC1-eens in cosmetic, pharmaceutical and veterinary medical preparations. These compounds can be used both in dissolved form and in the miC1-onized state.<br>
The UV absorbers according to the present invention can be used either in the dissolved state (soluble oR2anic filters, solubilized oR2anic filters) or in the miC1-onised state (nanoscalar oR2anic filters, particulate oR2anic filters, UV-absorber pigments).<br>
The triazine derivatives of formula (1) which have no alkyl substituents or only lower-alkyi substituents are characterized by a poor oil-solubility and a high melting point. They are therefore particularly suitable UV absorbers in the miC1-onized state.<br>
Any known process suitable for the preparation of miC1-oparticles can be used for the pre¬paration of the miC1-onised UV absorbers, for example:<br>
wet-milling (low viscous miC1-onisatlon process for pumpable dispersions), with a hard grinding medium, for example zirconium silicate balls in a ball mill and a protective surfactant or a protective polymer in water or in a suitable oR2anic solvent;<br>
wet-kneading (high viscous miC1-onisatlon process for non pump-able pastes) using a continuous or discontinuous (batch) kneader. For a wet-kneading process a solvent (water or cosmetically acceptable oils), a grinding-aid (surfactant, emulsifier) and a polymeric grinding aid may be used. Both processes may be used respectively spray-drying from a suitable solvent, for example aqueous suspensions or suspensions containing oR2anic solvents, or true solutions In water, ethanol, dichloroethane, toluene or N-methylpyR1olidone etc..<br>
by the expansion according to the RESS process (Rapid Jxpansion of SuperC1-itical Solutions) of superC1-itical fluids (e.g. CO2) in which the UV filter or filters is/are dissolved, or the expansion of fluid carison dioxide together with a solution of one or more UV filters in a suitable oR2anic solvent;<br>
by reprecipitation from suitable solvents, including superC1-itical fluids (GASR process = Gas Anti-Solvent ReC1-ystallisation / PCA process = Precipitation with Compressed Anti-solvents).<br><br>
As milling apparatus for the preparation of the miC1-onised oR2anic UV absorbers there may be used, for example, a jet mill, ball mill, vibratory mill or hammer mill, preferably a high¬speed mixing mill. Even more preferable mills are modern ball mills, manufacturers of these mill-types are for example Netzsch (LMZ-mill), Drais (DCP-viscoflow or cosmo), Buhler AG (centrifugal mills) or Bachhofer. The grinding is preferably caR1ied out with a grinding aid. As kneading apparatus for the preparation of the miC1-onised oR2anic UV absorbers examples are typical sigma-hook batch kneaders but also serial batch kneaders (IKA-Werke) or continuous kneaders (Continua from Werner und Pfleiderer).<br>
Useful low molecular weight grinding aids for all the above miC1-onizing processes are sur¬factants and emulsifies as disclosed below in the chapters "emulsifiers" and "surfactants".<br>
Useful polymeric grinding aids for water dispersion are cosmetically acceptable water soluble polymers with MW &gt; 5000 g/mol for example: aC1-ylates (Salcare types), modified or non-modified polysaccharides, poiyglucosides or xanthan gum. Furthermore an alkylated vinyl-pyR1olidone polymer, a vinylpyR1olidone/vinyl acetate copolymer, an acyl glutamate, an alkyl polyglucoside, ceteareth-25 or a phospholipid may be used. Oil dispersions may contain cosmetically acceptable waxy polymers or natural waxes as polymeric grinding aid to adjust viscosity during and after processing.<br>
Useful solvents are water, brine, (poly-)ethyleneglycol or glycerine for water-soluble dis¬persions and also cosmetically acceptable oils as desC1-ibed under "emollients" for oil-soluble dispersions.<br>
The miC1-onised UV absorbers so obtained usually have an average particle size from 0.02 to 2 miC1-ometers, preferably from 0.05 to 1.5 miC1-ometer and more especially from 0.1 to 1.0 miC1-ometers.<br>
The UV absoriaers can also be used dry in powder form. For that purpose the UV absorbers are subjected to known grinding methods, such as vacuum atomization, countercuR1ent spray-drying etc.. Such powders have a particle size of from 0.1 to 2 miC1-ometers. To avoid the occuR1ence of agglomeration, the UV absorbers can be coated with a surface-active<br><br>
compound prior to the pulverization process, for example with an anionic, non-ionic or amphoteric surfactant, e.g. a phospholipid or a known polymer, such as PVP, an aC1-ylate etc.<br>
The cosmetic formulations or pharmaceutical compositions according to the present inven¬tion can also contain one or more than one further UV filter as desC1-ibed in Tables 1-3.<br>
The cosmetic or pharmaceutical preparations can be prepared by physically mixing the UV absorber(s) with the adjuvant using customary methods, for example by simply stiR1ing to¬gether the individual components, especially by making use of the dissolution properties of already known cosmetic UV absorbers, for example octyl methoxy cinnamate, salicylic acid isooctyl ester, etc. The UV absorber can be used, for example, without further treatment, or in the miC1-onised state, or in the form of a powder.<br>
Cosmetic or pharmaceutical preparations contain from 0.05-40% by weight, based on the total weight of the composition, of one UV absorber or UV absorber mixtures.<br>
Preference is given to the use of mixing ratios of the UV absorber of formula (1) according to the present invention and optionally further light-protective agents (as desC1-ibed in table 1-3) from 1:99 to 99:1, especially from 1:95 to 95:1 and preferably from 10:90 to 90:10, based on weight. Of special interest are mixing ratios of from 20:80 to 80:20, especially from 40:60 to 60:40 and preferably approximately 50:50. Such mixtures can be used, inter alia, to improve solubility or inC1-ease UV absorption.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The cosmetic or pharmaceutical preparations may be, for example, C1-eams, gels, lotions, alcoholic and aqueous/alcoholic solutions, emulsions, wax/fat compositions, stick prepa¬rations, powders or ointments. In addition to the above mentioned UV filters, the cosmetic or pharmaceutical preparations may contain further adjuvants as desC1-ibed below.<br>
As water- and oil-containing emulsions (e.g. W/0, OAA/, 0/W/O and W/O/W emulsions or miC1-oemulsions) the preparations contain, for example, from 0.1 to 30 % by weight, pre¬ferably from 0.1 to 15 % by weight and especially from 0.5 to 10 % by weight, based on the total weight of the composition, of one or more UV absorbers, from 1 to 60 % by weight, especially from 5 to 50 % by weight and preferably from 10 to 35 % by weight, based on the total weight of the composition, of at least one oil component, from 0 to 30 % by weight, especially from 1 to 30 % by weight and preferably from 4 to 20 % by weight, based on the total weight of the composition, of at least one emulsifier, from 10 to 90 % by weight, especially from 30 to 90 % by weight, based on the total weight of the composition, of water, and from 0 to 88.9 % by weight, especially from 1 to 50 % by weight, of further cosmetically acceptable adjuvants.<br>

Holosphere additives (Sunspheres® ISP, Silica Shells Kobo.) deflect radiation and the effective path length of the photon is therefore inC1-eased.( EP0893119). Some beads, as mentioned pre¬viously, provide a soft feel during spreading. Moreover, the optical activity of such beads,<br><br>
e.g.MiC1-opearl M305, cans modulate skin shine by eliminating reflection plienomena and indirectly may scatter the UV light. When formulated in OAA/ emulsions, the preferably amount of such SPF enhancers should represent 1% to 10% of the total amount of the emulsion.<br>

Preparation Examples<br>
Example 1: General work procedure for the synthesis of dialkylated compounds of formula <br>
2-(4-Aminophenyl)-6-methylbenzothJazole (0.12 mol) is dissolved in 200 ml of absolute tetrahydrofuran and cooled to -10°C. At from -5 to -10C, 6.34 g of (0.264mol) of sodium hydride is added, in portions, to the solution. The reaction mixture is stiR1ed at 10°C for 30 minutes. Then, 0.28 mol of the appropriate haloalkane dissolved in 200 ml of absolute tetrahydrofuran is added dropwise in such a manner that the reaction temperature does not exceed 10'C. The reaction mixture is then heated to boiling point and refluxed for about 20 hours. After the reaction is complete, 10 ml of methanol are added and the reaction mixture is then reduced to half its original volume using a rotary evaporator. After adding 200 ml of distilled water, the C1-ude product is extracted with ethyl acetate. Subsequent column chromatography over silica gel using a mixture of cyclohexane and ethyl acetate yields the pure product, which is dried under a high vacuum at SOX and 0.02 mbar.<br><br><br><br>
Example 2: General work procedure for the synthesis of monoalkylated compounds of<br><br>
0.12 mol of 2-(4-aminophenyl)-6-methylbenzothiazole is dissolved in 200 ml of absolute tetrahydrofuran and cooled to -10°C. At from -5 to -10'C, 3.17g (0.132 mol) of sodium hydride are added, in portions, to the solution. The reaction mixture is then stin-ed at 10C for 30 minutes before 0.13 mol of the appropriate haloalkane dissolved in 200 ml of absolute tetrahydrofuran is added dropwise. After heating to boiling point, the reaction mixture is refluxed for about 20 hours until the reaction is complete 10 ml of methanol are then added and the reaction mixture is concentrated to half its original volume using a rotary evaporator. After adding 200 ml of distilled water, the C1-ude product is extracted with ethyl acetate. Subsequent column chromatography over silica gel using a mixture of cyclohexane and ethyl acetate yields the pure product, which is dried under a high vacuum at 80°C and 0.02 mbar.<br><br><br><br>
