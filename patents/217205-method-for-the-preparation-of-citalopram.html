				<td>The present invention relates to a method for the preparation of the well known antidepressant drug citalopram, l-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]-l-(4-fluorophenyl)-l,3-dihydro-5-isobenzofurancarbonitrile.<br>
Background of the Invention.<br>
Citalopram is a well known antidepressant drug that has now been on the market for some years and has the following structure:<br><br>
It is a selective, centrally acting serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) reuptake inhibitor, accordingly having antidepressant activities. The antidepressant activity of the compound has been reported in several publications, eg. J. Hyttel, Prog. Neuro-Psychopharmacol. &amp; Biol. Psychiat., 1982, 6, 277-295 and A. Gravem, Acta Psychiatr. Scand., 1987, 75 , 478-486. The compound has further been disclosed to show effects in the treatment of dementia and cerebrovascular disorders, EP-A 474580.<br>
Citalopram was first disclosed in DE 2,657,271 corresponding to US 4,136,193. This patent publication describes the preparation of citalopram by one method and outlines a further method which may be used for preparing citalopram.<br>
According to the process described, the corresponding l-(4-fluorophenyl)-l,3-dihydro-5-isobenzofurancarbonitrile is reacted with 3-(N,N-dimethylarnino)propyl-chloride in the presence of methylsulfinylmethide as condensing agent. The starting material was prepared from the corresponding 5-bromo derivative by reaction with cuprous cyanide.<br>
According to the method, which is only outlined in general terms, citalopram may be obtained by ring closure of the compound:<br><br><br>
in the presence of a dehydrating agent and subsequent exchange of the 5-bromo group with cuprous cyanide. The starting material of Formula II is obtained from 5-bromophthalide by two successive Grignard reactions, i.e. with 4-fluorophenyl magnesium chloride and N,N-dimethylaminopropyl magnesium chloride, respectively.<br>
A new and surprising method and an intermediate for the preparation of citalopram were described in US Patent No 4,650,884 according to which an intermediate of the formula<br><br>
is subjected to a ring closure reaction by dehydration with strong sulfuric acid in order to obtain citalopram. The intermediate of Formula III was prepared from 5-cyanophthalide by two successive Grignard reactions, i.e. with 4-fluorophenyl magnesium halogenide and N,N-dimethylaminopropyl magnesium halogenide, respectively.<br>
Further processes are disclosed in International patent application Nos. WO 98019511, WO 98019512 and WO 98019513. WO 98019512 and WO 98019513 relate to methodVwherein a 5-ammo-, 5-carboxy- or." 5-(sec. aminocarbonyl)phthahde is subjected to two successive Grignard reactions, ring closure and conversion of the resulting 1,3-dihydroisobenzofuran derivative to the corresponding 5-cyano compound, i.e. citalopram. International patent application No. WO 98019511 discloses a process for the manufacture of citalopram wherein a (4-substituted-2hydroxymethylphenyl-(4-fluorphenyl)methanol compound is subjected to ring closure and the resulting 5-substituted 1 -(4-fluorophenyl)- 1,3-dihydroisobenzofuran converted to the corresponding 5-cyano derivative which is alkylated with a (3-dimethylamino)propylhalogenide in order to obtain citalopram.<br><br><br>
inally, methods of preparing the individual enantiomers of citalopram are disclosed in US atent No 4,943,590 from which it also appears that the ring closure of the intermediate of formula III may be carried out via a labile ester with a base.<br>
It has now, surprisingly, been found that citalopram may be manufactured by a novel avourable and safe procedure using convenient starting materials.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a novel method for the preparation of citalopram comprising the steps of:<br>
a)	subjecting a compound of Formula IV<br><br>
wherein R is<br>
	a group wherein Rl and R2 are independently selected from lower<br>
alkyl, aryl and heteroaryl, or Rl and R2 are linked and together designate a 4- or 5-<br>
membered chain optionally comprising an S, O or N atom, or<br>
â€¢	4,5-dihydro-l,3-oxazol-2-yl optionally substituted in the 4- and/or 5-position with<br>
one ore more lower alkyl, aryl or heteroaryl groups<br>
to reductive hydrolysis, and<br>
b)	converting the resulting 5-formyl compound of Formula V<br><br><br>
to the corresponding 5-cyano compound, i.e. citalopram<br><br>
which is isolated as the base or a pharmaceutical^ acceptable salt thereof.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides the novel intermediate of Formula V.<br>
A further aspect of the invention relates to the novel intermediate for preparation of citalopram having Formula IV<br>
In a further aspect the invention relates to the above process in which the compound of Formula IV is the S-enatiomer.<br>
In yet another aspect, the present invention relates to an antidepressant pharmaceutical composition comprising citalopram manufactured by the process of the invention.<br>
Throughout the specification and claims, lower alkyl refers to a branched or unbranched alkyl group having from one to six carbon atoms inclusive, such as methyl, ethyl, 1-propyl, 2-propyl, 1-butyl, 2-butyl, 2-methyl-2-propyl, 2,2-dimethyl-l-ethyl and 2-methyl-l-propyl.<br>
The term aryl refers to a mono- or bicyclic carbocyclic aromatic group, such as phenyl and naphthyl, in particular phenyl.<br><br>
he term heteroaryl refers to a mono- or bicyclic heterocyclic aromatic group, such as idolyl, thienyl, pyrimidyl, oxazolyl, isoxazolyl, thiazolyl, isothiazolyl, imidazolyl, enzofiiranyl, benzothienyl, pyridyl, and furanyl, in particular pyrimidyl, indolyl, and thienyl.<br>
lalogen means fluoro, chloro, bromo or iodo.<br>
Leductive hydrolysis means reduction of the group R followed by treatment with H20 hereby forming an aldehyde group.<br>
Vhen Rl and R2 are linked and together designate a 4- or 5-membered chain optionally :omprising an S, O or N atom, Rl and R2 together with the N-atom to which they are linked "orm a 5- or 6-membered ring optionally having a heteroatom selected from O, S and N in iddition to the N-atom to which Rl and R2 are linked. Examples of such groups are norpholinyl, piperidyl, etc. <br>
n a preferred embodiment of the invention, R is morpholinocarbonyl, di(lower alkyl)aminocarbonyl or 4,4-di(lower alkyl)-l,3-oxazolidin-2-yl, most preferably morpholinocarbonyl, dimethylaminocarbonyl or 4,4-dimethyl-l,3-oxazolidin-2-yl.<br>
[n a preferred embodiment of the invention the intermediate of Formula IV is prepared by ring closure of the corresponding compound of Formula VI: <br>
Preferably the compound of Formula VI is obtained from the corresponding 5-R-substituted phthalide derivative by two successive Grignard reactions, i.e. with a Grignard reagent of 4-halogen-fluorophenyl and a Grignard reagent of 3-halogen-N,N-dimethyl-propylamine, respectively. When R is an optionally substituted 4,5-dihydro-l,3-oxazol-2-yl group the ^compound of Formula VI may alternatively be prepared from 4-dimethylamino-l-(4-fluorophenyl)-butan-l-one by Grignard reaction with a properly protected 2-(hydroxymethyl)-4-(4,5-dihydro~l,3-oxazol-2-yl)-phenyl magnesium halogenide derivative. <br><br>
The reductive hydrolysis of the compound of Formula IV is conveniently carried out by reduction of a compound of Formula IV with a suitable reducing agent such as an aluminium or boron containing agent, conveniently Dibal-H, superhydride, LiAlH4, BH4" (Li+, Na+ or K+), etc., followed by addition of H:0. When R is a 4,5-dihydro-l,3-oxazol-2-yl-group the reaction may be carried out by alkylation with a proper alkylation agent, such as Mel, a .dialkylsulfate or like, followed by reduction and hydrolysis as above. In all cases the reduction is performed under strictly controlled conditions, preferably at about 0Â°C.<br>
" The conversion of the 5-formyl compound of Formula V to citalopram is carried out by<br>
/Conversion of the formyl group to an oxime or similar group by reaction with a reagent R3-X-<br>
NH2 wherein R3 is hydrogen, lower alkyl, aryl or heteroaryl and X is O, N or S, followed by<br>
dehydration  with   a  common  dehydrating   agent,   for  example   thionylchloride,   acetic<br>
anhydride/pyridine, pyridine/HCl or phosphor pentachloride. Preferred reagents R3-X-NH,<br>
are hydroxylamin and compounds wherein R3 is alkyl or aryl and X is N or O.<br>
Ring closure of the compound of Formula VI may be effected by an acid or via a labile ester<br>
 with a base. Acidic ring closure is_performed by an inorganic acid, such as a sulfuric or<br>
phosphoric acid, or an organic acid, such as methylsulfonic, p-toluenesulfonic or trifluoro-<br>
acetic acid. The basic ring closure is performed via a labile ester, such as the methane<br><br>
sulfonyl, p-toluene sulfonyl, 10-camphorsulfonyl, trifluoroacetyl or trifluoromethanesulfonyl<br>
ester with addition of a base, such as triethyl amine, dimethylaniline, pyridine, etc. The <br>
reaction is performed in an inert solvent, preferably with cooling, in particular about 0 Â°C and<br>
is preferably carried out by a one-pot procedure, i.e. with esterification and simultaneous<br>
addition of the base. Before further reaction the intermediate of Formula VI may be separated<br>
into its enantiomers, thereby obtaining the enantiomer giving S-citalopram. <br>
Grignard reagents of 4-halogen-fluorophenyl that may be used in the preparation of a compound of Formula VI are the magnesium halogenides, such as the chloride, bromide or iodide. Preferably the magnesium bromide is used. Grignard reagents of 3-halogen-N,N-dimethylpropylamine that may be used are the magnesium halogenides, such as the chloride, bromide or iodide, preferably the magnesium chloride. Preferably the two reactions are performed successively without isolation of the intermediate.<br>
Other reaction conditions, solvents, etc. are conventional conditions for such reactions and may easily be determined by a person skilled in the art.<br><br>
The 5-R-substituted phthalide starting materials used in the Grignard reactions may be prepared from 5-chlorocarbonylphthalide by reaction with the proper amine compounds.<br>
5-chlorocarbonylphthalide may again be prepared from 5-carboxyphtalide by reaction with thionyl chloride. 5-carboxyphtalide is commercially available and may be prepared by well known procedures (Tirouflet, J.; Bull.Soc.Sci. Bretagne 26, 1959,35).<br>
The compound of general Formula I may be used as the free base or as a pharmaceutical ly acceptable acid addition salt thereof. As acid addition salts, such salts formed with organic or inorganic acids may be used. Exemplary of such organic salts are those with maleic, fumaric, benzoic, ascorbic, succinic, oxalic, bismethyienesalicylic, methanesulfonic, ethanedisulfonic, acetic, propionic, tartaric, salicylic, citric, gluconic, lactic, malic, mandelic, cinnamic, citraconic, aspartic, stearic, palmitic, itaconic, glycolic, p-aminobenzoic, glutamic, benzene sulfonic and theophylline acetic acids, as well as the 8-halotheophyllines, for example 8-bromotheophylline. Exemplary of such inorganic salts are those with hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, sulfamic, phosphoric and nitric acids.<br>
The acid addition salts of the compounds may be prepared by methods known in the art. The base is reacted with either the calculated amount of acid in a water miscible solvent, such as accegtone or ethanol, with subsequent isolation of the salt by concentration and cooling, or with an excess of the acid in a water immiscible solvent, such as ethylether, ethylacetate or dichloromethane, with the salt separating spontaneously.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may be administered in any suitable way and in any suitable form, for example orally in the form of tablets, capsules, powders or syrups, or parenterally in the form of usual sterile solutions for injection.<br>
The pharmaceutical formulations of the invention may be prepared by conventional methods in the art. For example, tablets may be prepared by mixing the active ingredient with ordinary adjuvants and/or diluents and subsequently compressing the mixture in a conventional tabletting maschine. Examples of adjuvants or diluents comprise: Corn starch, potato starch, talcum, magnesium stearate, gelatine, lactose, gums, and the like. Any other adjuvant or additive colourings, aroma, preservatives etc. may be used provided that they are compatible with the active ingredients.<br>
Solutions for injections may be prepared by solving the active ingredient and possible additives in a part of the solvent for injection, preferably sterile water, adjusting the solution to the desired volume, sterilisation of the solution and filling in suitable ampoules or vials.<br><br>
Any suitable additive conventionally used in the art may be added, such as tonicity agents, preservatives, antioxidants, etc.<br>
