				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a novel process of distillation for fluids or effective mass<br>
transfer between fluids. The present invention also relates to a distillation apparatus which comprises of a re-boiler and / or condenser, integrated with a novel rotating packed bed (RPB) device which is optionally provided with a casing for carrying out the process of distillation of fluids or effective mass transfer between fluids. BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART<br>
A Gas-Liquid contacting device in a chemical process industry involves transfer of chemical component / components from one phase to the other. The mass transfer between fluids will be either "liquid -film controlled" or "gas film controlled", depends on the resistance offered at interface formed between liquid and gaseous phase, while said phases diffuses across the interface. Enhancement of mass transfer rate is achieved by reduction of Controlling Mass Transfer Resistances, or by increasing the Interfacial Area between the two phases, or by both. Effectuating the said enhancement by technologies/strategies enables the physical sizes of conventional process engineering units to be significantly reduced. This is the gist of Process Intensification that has become a mantra among process industries.<br>
The performance intensity of any equipment built with an objective to provide interface mass transfer or phase separation is partly dictated by the relative velocities at the interface. Large velocities imply high mass transfer coefficients. Large specific surface areas (small droplets, thin films, etc) ensures good mass transfer rate. The imposed centrifugal force on a multiphase system has been observed to be crucial in determining the fluid dynamic and hence the separation behavior. A large imposed force allows the use of packing with large specific surface area. If gas velocity increases, the system hydraulic capacity as well as the mass transfer coefficients get enhanced. Also, immersed bodies or channels which have a small characteristic dimension are intrinsically superior when performing a heat, mass or momentum operation. With above observations, Colin Ramshaw has concluded that the application of high imposed centrifugal force to multiphase mass transfer and separation system can intensify-the performance of an<br><br>
equipment significantly ("Opportunities for exploring centriftigal fields". The Chemical Engineer, June 1987). The Rotating Packed Beds (RPB's) exploits this strategy of operating under centrifugal fields to intensify the operation into a compact mode, which is not in the reachof units that rely on terrestrial gravitation.<br>
Ramshaw et al. (U.S. Patent 4,283,255) has claimed a process and apparatus for effecting mass transfer between two fluid phases, one of which is a liquid. The process comprises charging the fluids to a single packing rotating element which has a large interfacial area and which is permeable to the fluids and rotating the single packing element such that the fluids are subjected to an acceleration of at least 300 m.s-1 they flow through the same. The said patent also discusses distillation apparatus that deploys a plurality of permeable rotating elements in series, wherein the plurality of permeable element are rotatable about a common axis, each with its associated fluid collecting means, vaporizing means to vaporize a liquid (reboiler) and the vapor of which may be charged to the series of rotating elements and liquefying means to liquefy a vapor (condenser) discharged from the said series of permeable rotating elements. In conventional distillation and absorption columns, the gravitational field inherently governs the flow of Hquid and gas and the mass transfer rates. If this field is replaced by a centrifligal field of about 500 g to 1000 g high process intensification can be achieved. This leads to miniaturization of equipments and attendant benefits. The RPB, also known as HIGEE, has been proposed for carrying out distillation absorption and similar operations. It has been claimed that a volume reduction by a factor of 100 or more is possible by using such apparatus thus. In 1999 Dow Chemicals (D. Trent and D. Tirtowidjojo, "Commercial operation of a rotating packed bed (RPB) and other applications of RPB technology". BMR Group, London, 2002, p 11) has put a RPB into use in commercial absorption operation for production of hypochlorous acid similar to the HIGEE proposed by Ramshaw et al in their U.S. Patent No.4,283,255. The use of conventional RPB for distillation has not gained commercial acceptance.<br>
Zheng et al. ""Pressure Drop of Centripetal gas Flow through Rotating Beds", Ind. Eng. Chem. Res., 39 (3), 829-834, 2000 and Sandilya et al. "Gas-phase mass* transfer in a centrifugal contactor", Ind. Eng. ("Chem. Res., 40, 384-392, 2001 indicate that the gas<br><br>
rotates along with the packing without slip. Therefore, the gas flow is similar to its flow in a stationary rotor. As the slip velocity between the wet packing and the vapor in the radial direction is less than 3 m/s, no enhancement in kg is to be expected due to rotation of the bed. For distillation the controlling resistance is on the gas side. The conventional RPB's (single packing element) are not expected to lead to enhancement in kg. Hence, the intensification is only due to increased interfacial area and throughputs, which results in modest volume reducdon of about 10 times. Therefore, the design needs modification. The packing element in the conventional RPB system is essentially in the form of a single undivided unit. Hence, angular velocity throughout the packing elements is constant. The Applicants would like to highlight that due to the construction of the packing element in the form of a single undivided unit, the mass transfer coefficient decreases with increase in radius, hence RPB system of larger diameter cannot be constructed and operated efficiently. Thus, the prior art teaches use of a series of smaller diameter RPB unit for effective mass transfer. It should be noticed that for accomplishing distillation, it is essential to use two or more conventional RPB systems. As each of the conventional RPB system essentially has casing and fluid collecting means, for carrying the process of distillation, two or more conventional RPB systems having two or more casing, and two or more fluid collecting means are required.<br>
The process for distillation is conventionally carried using distillation apparatus which comprises a reboiler, a condenser, two conventional RPB system acting as stripping section and two conventional RPB system acting as enriching section. Thus, it can be noticed that such a distillation apparatus of components, occupies larger volume of space and is costly to construct.<br>
From the above descriptions of prior art, it is clear that there is a need for a more economical and simple process for distillation of fluids or effective mass transfer between fluids and apparatus /device thereof which overcomes drawbacks of higher volume of the equipment /device / plant, less value of liquid-film transfer coefficient and gas-film transfer coefficient, limitation of fluids or chemical mixture etc.<br>

The said device is rotated at a angular speed in the range of 1000 to 3000 rpm in co direction or in counter direction about an axis such that the liquid fluid flows radially outwards away from the said axis and said gaseous fluid flows radially inward to the said axis. The angular slip velocity increases with radius as the angular velocity between the consecutive elements increases with radius. Therefore the transfer coefficient increases with radius. The packing materials are metallic foams, etc. which has positive influence on the limits for the spectrum of chemicals that can be used in RPB. The annular packings form enriching and stripping sections which are functionally identical to the conventional distillation columns, but the flow rates of gas and liquid streams differs in each section. The enriching/stripping operations can be staged in a reboiler vessel by housing a novel RPB device with it, or separately by housing a novel RPB device in a reboiler and in a condenser vessel. In the latter case, the stripping section and the reboiler, and the enriching section and the condenser are coupled as shown in figures 6. This leads to high intensification of gas-side mass transfer coefficient which is controlling resistance in distillation and other processes including reactive separations. The RPB device of the present invention is not coupled with reboiler and condenser unlike in the conventional RPB; rather it is inserted in either or both reboiler and condenser. This arrangement eliminates the need for additional casing and the associated piping required in the conventional RPB.<br>
The integration of RPB device with one of the units to stage distillation eliminates the column and thereby reduces heat gain/loss across the column. Roughly half the heat that is lost/gain in a conventional column is saved by staging distillation using novel RPB. The integration of RPB device with reboiler or condenser or both or of similar units eliminates the casing is a unique feature.<br>
The gas flow into the eye of rotor has been prevented by withdrawing through one or two sides of the rotor. Thus, the countercurrent flow of liquid and gas at the inner radius is avoided in present RPB device. This permits the liquid to grip the packing by the time gas<br><br>
flow is encountered. This minimizes entrainment of liquid with outgoing gas and enhances<br>
the permissible throughputs and leads to intensification of the process.<br>
The proposed RPB device is capable for carrying out the distillation /absorption process<br>
for all types of fluids like benzene-toluene, toluene-xylene, ammonia-water, ethanol-water,<br>
processing of natural gas, propane-propylene, ethane-ethylene, etc.<br>
The present configuration for staging distillation can be operated for all the range of<br>
pressures and temperatures at which industrial distillation columns are being operated and<br>
capable to achieve relative velocity of 10-20 times for enhancing  mass transfer rates per<br>
unit volume compared to conventional columns.<br>
The proposed design allows the introduction of feed in between the annular rings. Hence a<br>
single packing element can be used. Nevertheless it doesn't preclude use of two packing<br>
elements.<br>
In the present invention, distillation can be staged in a single RPB accommodated either in<br>
the reboiler or the condenser thus eliminating the need of a casing for the RPB and reduces<br>
the volume of the equipment by a few times than the HI GEE proposed by Ramshaw et al.<br>
The working of present invention described more in details with reference to the<br>
accompanying figures.<br>
The novel RPB unit designed with the split packing has higher flooding velocities as<br>
shown in figure 1 than the conventional RPB. A single RPB unit can be used for both<br>
stripping and enriching unlike the conventional RPB, which requires a minimum of two<br>
units. In conventional RPB the gas-side mass transfer coefficient decreases with increase in<br>
radius and hence we are limited to have small rotors and therefore many rotors in series<br>
whereas in present RPB device, mass transfer coefficient increases with increase in radius<br>
and hence effectuate more process intensification than the conventional RPB and gas-side<br>
mass transfer coefficient doesn't have limitations like that of a conventional RPB. The<br>
novel RPB unit designed with the split packing can subdue all shortcomings by its unique<br>
design and mode of operation.<br>
The sectional front view and top view of a rotating packed bed device as shown in figure 2<br>
(a) and (b) illustrates the design of a rotating packed bed device which is useful to enhance<br>
the gas-side mass transfer coefficient. As shown in figure 1, that the top and bottom plates<br><br>
are fitted with fin like annular packing rings. The packing material are metal foam, wound wire mesh etc. for the top and bottom plates, and are rotate in opposite directions Sufficient gaps are provided to avoid brushing against each other. The centrifugal field has the same direction, though the packing elements are rotating in counter direction. The angular direction of vapor gets reversed as it flows through the successive packing elements. Slip velocity of 20 m/s or more can be achieved in contrast to the angular slip velocity of few cm/s in the conventional rotor. In between the packing elements, liquid flows as fine drops throughout the periphery of packing element. However, the packing rings width has to be adjusted to get the desired enhancement in mass transfer. The RPB device with a gas withdrawal system to enhance throughputs is shown in figure 3, The upper limits of RPB's throughput are limited by its flooding characteristics. In a conventional rotor, the liquid is sprayed onto the packing or introduced as jets in the inner radius of packing at which the gas velocity is highest in the rotor. At the onset of conditions prior to flooding, liquid drops get entrained and contaminate the vapor product; and leads to entrainment 'flooding'. At this condition, a significant fraction of liquid gets thrown back into the eye. The said liquid fraction flows as a thick film on the bottom plate by passing the contact with the vapor. The said thick film leads to reduction of mass transfer rate and contamination of the liquid product. In the present invention to enhance throughputs, the gas is prevented from entering the eye of rotor by withdrawing it about a few centimeters from the eye as shown in figure 2. This permits the liquid to grip the packing before it comes into contact with the vapor stream. The entrainment can occur only due to shearing of the liquid film that is held to the packing. Therefore, the entrainment is less even if throughputs are higher by 3 -5 times compared to a conventional rotor.<br>
The RPB device having show feed entry of fluid between stripping and enriching sections is shown in figure 4. The novel RPB that has been proposed is capable to accomplish both stripping and enriching operations with a present rotor design having feed entry as shown in figure 4. The RPB rotor made of fin-like packing elements permits the introduction of feed in the desired radial location by the design given show in figure 4. The feed is introduced through hollow shaft into a jacket fixed to the bottom plate. A few<br><br>
(2-6) perforated tubes are provided to the jacket through the bottom plate. The liquid or vapor flows onto the packing as jets. Unlike in the conventional RPB's, vapor can also be fed in the novel RPB.<br>
A system in which RPB device is integrated inside to a reboiler is shown in figure 5 and an operational system for stage distillation with a reboiler and condenser. The said system shall foresee the conventional still columns as redundant. The stripping and enriching sections are integrated along with the reboiler/condenser by housing a present RPB within the reboiler/condenser. Unlike the conventional schemes proposed for staging distillation with RPB's having a casing, the proposed scheme for distillation/absorption operations do not require the RPB to be housed within a casing. The sketch of the present distillation unit with the stripping and enriching sections integrated with the reboiler is shown in Figure 5. This makes the unit compact. The heat gain/loss is reduced, which is of significance for cryogenic distillation. Moreover, the holdup and transients are reduced. Distillation can be accomplished at high pressure. The present system is capable to achieve high mass transfer rate by operating at high pressure, more than compensates the negative effect due to reduction in the relative volatility (for majority of systems). This reduces the size of the unit further.<br>
The distillation apparatus comprising a reboiler and a condenser integrated both with RPB device is shown in figure 6 whereas the relative volatility is small between fluids. To combat the situation of large rotor and unacceptable mechanical stresses, the distillation could be staged in a reboiler and condenser having two RPB rotors, i.e. one rotor to integrate stripping with reboiler and other to integrate enriching with the condenser as shown in Figure 6. In the present system the rotor integrated with the condenser has to be within a casing.<br>
The effect of increasing radius of the packing on volumetric gas-side mass transfer coefficient between conventional RPB unit &amp; the present RPB unit (a) With all packing elements, (b) Without the last packing (where slip velocity would not exist) is shown in figure 9. In fact in the conventional rotor the slip velocity and hence mass transfer coefficient decreases with increase in radius. On the other hand, the slip velocity and<br><br>
hence mass transfer coefficient increases with radius in the novel RPB unit as shown in<br>
figure 9.<br>
