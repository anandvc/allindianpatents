BACKGROUND OP THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The invention concerns cosmetic compositions formulated with nerve receptor skin stimulating terpene mixtures.<br>
The Related Art<br>
Somatic sensation enables our bodies to feel, ache and react to temperature changes.  The reactions occur when skin sensory receptors throughout the body are stimulated by mechanical, physical or chemical contact.  Different receptors are responsible for different stimuli; these are categorized as pain, pressure or temperature changes. Special pathways exist for face sensations.  The trigeminal nerve is located on the right side of the face.  It extends beyond the ear, underneath and branches out towards the cheek area.  Properly formulated cosmetic compositions can stimulate the receptors to produce very positive pleasant effects.<br>
One of the oldest stimulants is 1-menthol; it imparts a cooling sensation to the skin. Menthol and related terpenes do not really cool through the effect of latent cold. Actually they heighten the perception of cold in the nerve endings in the skin, so that the surface of skin "feels cold".  A problem with menthol is that above certain concentrations it causes burning and itching.<br>
2<br><br>
Australian Patent Application 81846/98 describes coolant powders imparting a cool/dry feeling to the skin without any burning sensation or harsh odor.  The active system is based upon a combination of one or more actives including menthyl lactate and isopulegol.  WO 99/13734 discloses similar actives.<br>
New cooling agents are continuously being sought which exhibit improved properties.  Attributes of interest are odorlessness, tastelessness, relatively low burning sensation and enhanced cooling effects.<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a sensate cocktail which when incorporated into a cosmetic composition will enhance pleasant skin sensations while minimizing unpleasant ones.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide cosmetic compositions formulated with improved sensate cocktails allowing the compositions to impart rapid and long lasting pleasant sensations to the skin.<br>
These and other objects of the present invention will become more readily apparent from consideration of the following summary and detailed description.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A sensate composition is provided which includes: (i)  menthyl lactate as a cooling agent; (ii) isopulegol as a sensory extender; and (iii)menthoxypropanediol as a codling enhancer.<br>
3<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Now it has been discovered that sensory awareness can be stimulated in a highly pleasant manner by a combination of menthyl lactate, isopulegol and menthoxypropanediol. Menthyl lactate operates as a cooling agent, isopulegol interacts therewith as a sensation extender and menthoxypropanediol enhances cooling of the combination. The sensate composition can be applied to a variety of cosmetics. Most particularly they are suitable for skin creams and lotions.  However, these sensate compositions will have applicability to dental care (mouthwash, toothpaste, floss), hair care (shampoo, conditioner, styling gels and sprays), shaving products (shaving foam, aftershave lotion), underarm products (antiperspirants and deodorants), personal wash products (toilet bars and body wash liquids), perfume and cologne, lip care products (lipstick and lip balm) all of which are merely illustrative.<br>
Thus, a first necessary component of sensate compositions according to the present invention is that of menthyl lactate.  The substance has a molecular weight of 228 and<br>
empirical formula of C13H24O3.  It is available under the<br>
trademark Frescolot Type ML from the Haarmann &amp; Reimer Corporation.<br>
A second necessary component of sensate compositions according to the present invention is that of isopulegol, particularly 1-isopulegol.  This material has a chemical name of 5-methyl-2-(1-methylethenyl)-cyclohexanol having a<br>
4<br><br>
molecular weight of 154 and formula of CioHieO.  It is available under the trademark Coolact P from Takasago International Corporation, Rockleigh, New Jersey.<br>
A third necessary component of sensate compositions according to the present invention is that of menthoxypropanediol.  Chemically this material is identified as 3 - [ [5-methyl -2 - (1 -methylethyl) cyclohexyl ] oxy] -1,2-propanediol having molecular weight 230 and empirical formula C13H26O3.  This substance is available under the trademark Cooling Agent 10 from the Takasako International Corporation.<br>
Amounts of the isopulegol and menthyl lactate may each range from 0.0001 to 2%, preferably from 0.005 to 1% more preferably from 0.01 to 0.5%, optimally from 0.05 to 0.2% by weight of a cosmetic composition into which the sensate composition is placed. Relative weight ratios of menthyl lactate and isopulegol in the sensate and cosmetic compositions may range from 1,000:1 to 1:100, preferably from 100:1 to 1:20, more preferably from 50:1 to 1:1, optimally from 20:1 to 2:1.<br>
Amounts of menthoxypropanediol may range from 0.0001 to 2%, preferably from 0.005 to 1%, more preferably from 0.01 to 0.5%, optimally from 0.05 to 0.2% by weight of a cosmetic composition into which the sensate composition is placed. On a relative weight basis, the menthyl lactate and isopulegol combination relative to that of menthoxypropanediol may range from 1,000:1 to 1:100,<br>
5<br><br>
preferably from 100:1 to 1:20, more preferably from 50:1 to 1:1, optimally from 20:1 to 2:1.<br>
Sensate compositions of the present invention may be formulated into cosmetic compositions.  Sensate and cosmetic compositions will have substantial amounts of a cosmetically acceptable carrier for delivering the sensate composition. The carrier may be present in amounts from 10 to 99.99% preferably from 50 to 99.9%, optimally from 98 to 99% by weight.  Since most of the experimentation to date has been conducted on skin care products, cosmetically acceptable carriers related to these products will be described below. However, carriers suitable for other types of cosmetics are well known to chemists and the sensate compositions can be appropriately formulated.<br>
By the term "cosmetically acceptable carriers" is meant any one or a combination of substances selected from water, polyols, silicone fluids, esters, hydrocarbons and inorganic powders.<br>
Polyols suitable for the present invention may include propylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, sorbitol, hydroxypropyl sorbitol, hexylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, 1,2,6-hexanetriol, glycerin, ethoxylated glycerin, propoxylated glycerin, xylitol and mixtures thereof.<br>
Silicone oils may also be included as carriers in the compositions of this invention.  These oils may either be nonvolatile or volatile.  The nonvolatile silicone oils<br>
6<br><br>
useful in the compositions of this invention are exemplified by the polyalkyl siloxanes, polyalkylaryl siloxanes and polyether siloxane copolymers.  The essentially nonvolatile polyalkyl siloxanes useful herein include, for example, polydimethyl siloxanes with viscosities of from about 5 to about 100,000 centistokes at 25°C.  Such polyalkyl siloxanes include the Viscasil series (sold by General Electric Company) and the Dow Corning 200 series (sold by Dow Corning Corporation).  Polyalkylaryl siloxanes include poly(methylphenyl)siloxanes having viscosities of from about 15 to about 65 centistokes at 25°C.  These are available, for example, as SF-1075 methylphenyl fluid (sold by General Electric Company) and 556 Cosmetic Grade Fluid (sold by Dow Corning Corporation),  Useful polyether siloxane copolymers include, for example, a polyoxyalkylene ether copolymer having a viscosity of about 1200 to 1500 centistokes at 25°C.  Such a fluid is available as SF-1066 organosilicone surfactant (sold by General Electric Company).  Cetyl dimethicone copolyol and cetyl dimethicone are especially preferred because these materials also function as emulsifiers and emollients. The former material is available from Goldschmidt AG under the trademark Abil EM-90.<br>
Crosslinked siloxane elastomers may also be included as carriers. These substances may normally have an average molecular weight in excess of 10,000, preferably in excess of a million and optimally will range from 10,000 to 20 million.  The elastomers may be formed of polyoxyalkylene units or they may be of the "non-emulsifying" variety where these units are absent.  These substances are available from<br>
7<br><br>
Grant Industries Inc., Dow-Corning Corporation and the General Electric Company.  They are known under the CTFA names of Crosslinked Stearyl Methyl-Dimethyl Siloxane Copolymer, Polysilicone-11 and Vinyl Dimethicone/Methicone Cross Polymer.<br>
Nonvolatile siloxanes may also be employed.  Illustrative of this category are the cyclo polydimethyl siloxane fluids of<br>
the formula ((CH3)2SiO)XN wherein x denotes an integer of from 3 to 6.  The cyclic siloxanes will have a boiling point of less than 250°C and a viscosity at 25°C of less than 10 centipoise.  Cyclomethicone is the common name of such materials.  The tetramer and pentamer cyclomethicones are commercially available as DC 244 and DC 344 from the Dow Corning Corporation.<br>
Esters may also be incorporated into the cosmetic compositions as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers.  Among the esters are:<br>
(1)  Alkyl esters of fatty acids having 10 to 20 carbon atoms. Methyl, isopropyl, and butyl esters of fatty acids are useful herein. Examples include hexyl laurate, isohexyl laurate, isohexyl palmitate, isopropyl palmitate, decyl oleate, isodecyl oleate, hexadecyl stearate, decyl stearate, isopropyl isostearate, diisopropyl adipate, diisohexyl adipate, dihexyldecyl adipate, diisopropyl sebacate, lauryl lactate, myristyl lactate, and cetyl<br>
8<br><br>
lactate.  Particularly preferred are C3.2-C15 alcohol benzoate esters.<br>
(2)	Alkenyl esters of fatty acids having 10 to 20 carbon atoms. Examples thereof include oleyl myristate, oleyl stearate and oleyl oleate.<br>
(3)	Ether-esters such as fatty acid esters of ethoxylated fatty alcohols.<br>
(4)	Polyhydric alcohol esters.  Ethylene glycol mono and di-fatty acid esters, diethylene glycol mono-and di-fatty acid esters, polyethylene glycol (200-6000) mono- and di-fatty acid esters,<br>
polyglycerol poly-fatty esters, ethoxylated glyceryl monostearate, 1,3-butylene glycol monostearate, 1,3-butylene glycol distearate, polyoxyethylene polyol fatty acid ester, sorbitan fatty acid esters, and polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters are satisfactory polyhydric alcohol esters.<br>
(5)	Wax esters such as beeswax, spermaceti, myristyl myristate, stearyl stearate.<br>
(6)	sterols esters, of which cholesterol fatty acid esters are examples thereof.<br>
Hydrocarbons may also be useful as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers.  Illustrative of this category are<br>
