Process for preparing a chlorohvdrin by converting polvhvdroxvlated<br>
aliphatic hydrocarbons<br>
The present patent application claims the benefit of patent application FR 05.05120 and of patent application EP 05104321.4, both filed on 20 May 2005, and of provisional US patent applications 60/734659, 60/734627, 60/734657, 60/734658, 60/734635, 60/734634, 60/734637 and 60/734636, all filed on 8 November 2005, the content of ail of which is incorporated here by reference.<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing a chlorohydrin by converting polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbons, more specifically by chlorinating polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbons.<br>
Chlorohydrins are reaction intermediates in the preparation of epoxides. Dichloropropanol, for example, is a reaction intermediate in the preparation of epichlorohydrin and of epoxy resins (Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Fourth Edition, 1992, Vol. 2, page 156, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.).<br>
According to known processes it is possible to obtain dichloropropanol in particular by hypochlorinating allyl chloride, by chlorinating allyl alcohol and by hydrochlorinating glycerol. This latter process has the advantage that the dichloropropanol can be obtained starting from fossil raw materials or from renewable raw materials, and it is known that natural petrochemical resources, from which the fossil materials are obtained, such as petroleum, natural gas or coal, for example, are limited in their terrestrial availability.<br>
Application WO 2005/054167 of SOLVAY SA describes a process for preparing dichloropropanol by reacting glycerol with hydrogen chloride in the presence of an acid, such as adipic acid, as catalyst.  In this process the dichloropropanol is separated from the other products of the reaction, and these products are recycled to the glycerol chlorination reactor. It is possible to withdraw a fraction of these other reaction products via a purge and to subject said fraction to various treatments prior to possible discharge. Discharge does not constitute an acceptable solution from an environmental standpoint. Moreover, the extra cost associated with the pre-discharge treatment may be prohibitive for the economics of the process.<br>
The objective of the invention is to provide a process for preparing a<br><br>
chlorohydrin that does not exhibit these drawbacks.<br>
The invention accordingly provides a process for preparing a chlorohydrin in which a polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbon, an ester of a polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbon or a mixture thereof whose total metal content, expressed in elemental form, is greater than or equal to 0.1 |ig/kg and less than or equal to 1000 mg/kg is reacted with a chlorinating agent.<br>
It has been found that, by using a polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbon, an ester of a polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbon or a mixture thereof having a metal content, expressed in elemental form, of greater than or equal to 0.1 |ig/kg and less than or equal to 1000 mg/kg, it is possible to subject the purges from the process to oxidation at a temperature greater than or equal to 800°C, and to obtain the following advantages :<br>
1)	recovery of the chlorinating agent;<br>
2)	recovery of the useful energy content of the reaction by-products;<br>
3)	reduction in the amount and toxicity of the by-products for discharge.<br>
Without wishing to be tied by any particular theoretical explanation, it is thought that oxidation at a temperature greater than or equal to 800°C may be conducted under satisfactory conditions because the reactions between the refractory materials making up the oxidation plant and the metals present in the purges are reduced by virtue of the low metal content of the by-products formed in the process. There is also avoidance of blockages within the oxidation plant.<br>
The term "polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbon" refers to a hydrocarbon which contains at least two hydroxyl groups attached to two different saturated carbon atoms. The polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbon may contain, but is not limited to, from 2 to 60 carbon atoms.<br>
Each of the carbons of a polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbon bearing the hydroxyl functional group (OH) cannot possess more than one OH group and must have sp3 hybridization. The carbon atom carrying the OH group may be primary, secondary or tertiary. The polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbon used in the present invention must contain at least two sp3-hybridized carbon atoms carrying an OH group. The polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbon includes any hydrocarbon containing a vicinal diol (1,2-diol) or a vicinal triol (1,2,3-triol), including the higher, vicinal or contiguous orders of these repeating units. The definition of the polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbon also includes, for example, one or more 1,3-, 1,4-, 1,5- and 1,6-diol functional groups. The polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbon may also be a polymer such as<br><br>
polyvinyl alcohol. Geminal diols, for example, are excluded from this class of polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbons.<br>
The polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbons may contain aromatic moieties or heteroatoms, including, for example, heteroatoms of halogen, sulphur, phosphorus, nitrogen, oxygen, silicon and boron type, and mixtures thereof<br>
Polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbons which can be used in the present invention comprise, for example, 1,2-ethanediol (ethylene glycol), K2-propanediol (propylene glycol), 1,3-propanediol, l-chloro-2.3-propanediol (chloropropanediol), 2-chloro-1,3-propanediol (chloropropanediol), 1,4-butanediol, 1,5-pentanediol, cyclohexanediols, l,2^butanediol, K2-cyclohexanedimethanol, 1,2,3-propanetriol (also known as " glycerol " or ' glycerin "), and mixtures thereof. With preference the polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbon used in the present invention includes, for example. 1,2-ethanediol, 1,2-propanediol, 1,3-propanediol, chloropropanediol and 1,2,3-propanetriol, and mixtures of at least two thereof. More preferably the polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbon used in the present invention includes, for example, 1,2-ethanediol, 1,2-propanediol, chloropropanediol and 1.2,3-propanetrioi, and mixtures of at least two thereof.  1,23-Propanetriol or glycerol is the most preferred.<br>
The esters of the polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbon may be present in the polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbon and/or may be produced in the process for preparing the chlorohydrin and/or may be prepared prior to the process for preparing the chlorohydrin. Examples of esters of the polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbon comprise ethylene glycol monoacetate, propanediol monoacetates, glycerol monoacetates, glycerol monostearates, glycerol diacetates and mixtures thereof<br>
The term "chlorohydrin" is used here in order to describe a compound containing at least one hydroxy! group and at least one chlorine atom attached to different saturated carbon atoms. A chlorohydrin which contains at least two hydroxy! groups is also a polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbon. Accordingly the starting material and the product of the reaction may each be chlorohydrins. In that case the "product" chlorohydrin is more chlorinated than the starting chlorohydrin, in other words has more chlorine atoms and fewer hydroxy! groups than the starting chlorohydrin. Preferred chlorohydrins are chloroethanoK chloropropanol, chloropropanediol, dichloropropanol and mixtures of at least<br><br>
two thereof. Dichloropropanol is particularly preferred. Chlorohydrins which are more particularly preferred are 2-chloroethanoK l-chloropropan-2-ol, 2-chloropropan-l-ol, l-chloropropane-23-diol, 2-chloropropane-13-dioU K3-dichloropropan-2-ol, 2,3-dichloropropan-l-ol and mixtures of at least two thereof<br>
The polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbon, the ester of polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbon, or the mixture thereof in the process according to the invention may be obtained starting from fossil raw materials or starting from renewable raw materials, preferably starting from renewable raw materials.<br>
By fossil raw materials are meant materials obtained from the processing of petrochemical natural resources, such as petroleum, natural gas and coal, for example. Among these materials preference is given to organic compounds containing 2 and 3 carbon atoms. When the polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbon is glycerol, allyl chloride, allyl alcohol and " synthetic " glycerol are particularly preferred. By " synthetic " glycerol is meant a glycerol generally obtained from petrochemical resources. When the polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbon is ethylene glycol, ethylene and " synthetic " ethylene glycol are particularly preferred. By " synthetic " ethylene glycol is meant an ethylene glycol generally obtained from petrochemical resources. When the polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbon is propylene glycol, propylene and ' synthetic " propylene glycol are particularly preferred. By " synthetic " propylene glycol is meant a propylene glycol generally obtained from petrochemical resources.<br>
By renewable raw materials are meant materials obtained from the processing of renewable natural resources. Among these materials preference is given to " natural " ethylene glycol, " natural " propylene glycol and " natural'" glycerol. " Natural " ethylene glycol, propylene glycol and glycerol are obtained for example by conversion of sugars by thermochemical processes, it being possible for these sugars to be obtained starting from biomass, as described in "Industrial Bioproducts : Today and Tomorrow", Energetics, Incorporated for the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Office of the Biomass Program, July 2003, pages 49, 52 to 56. One of these processes is, for example, the catalytic hydrogenolysis of sorbitol obtained by thermochemical conversion of glucose. Another process is, for example, the catalytic hydrogenolysis of xylitol obtained by hydrogenation of xylose. The xylose may for example be obtained by hydrolysis of the hemicellulose present<br><br>
in maize fibres. By ' natural glycerol " or " glycerol obtained from renewable raw materials " is meant, in particular, glycerol obtained during the production of biodiesel or else glycerol obtained during conversions of animal or vegetable oils or fats in general, such as saponification, transesterification or hydrolysis reactions.<br>
Among the oils which can be used for preparing the natural glycerol, mention may be made of all common oils, such as palm oil, palm kernel oil, copra oil, babassu oil, former or new (low erucic acid) colza oil, sunflower oil, maize oil, castor oil and cotton oil, peanut oil, soya bean oil, linseed oil and crambe oil, and all oils obtained, for example, from sunflower plants or colza plants obtained by genetic modification or hybridization.<br>
It is also possible to employ used frying oils, various animal oils, such as fish oils, tallow, lard and even squaring greases.<br>
Among the oils used mention may also be made of oils which have been partly modified by means, for example, of polymerization or oligomerization, such as, for example, the "stand oils" of linseed oil and of sunflower oil, and blown vegetable oils.<br>
A particularly suitable glycerol may be obtained during the conversion of animal fats. Another particularly suitable glycerol may be obtained during the production of biodiesel. A third, very suitable glycerol may be obtained during the conversion of animal or vegetable oils or fats by transesterification in the presence of a heterogeneous catalyst, as described in documents FR 2752242, FR 2869612 and FR 2869613. More specifically, the heterogeneous catalyst is selected from mixed oxides of aluminium and zinc, mixed oxides of zinc and titanium, mixed oxides of zinc, titanium and aluminium, and mixed oxides of bismuth and aluminium, and the heterogeneous catalyst is employed in the form of a fixed bed. This latter process can be a process for producing biodiesel.<br>
In the process according to the invention it is preferred to use a polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbon, an ester of a polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbon or a mixture thereof which is obtained starting from renewable raw materials.<br>
In the process for preparing a chlorohydrin according to the invention, the polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbon, the ester of polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbon or the mixture thereof may have an alkali metal and/or alkaline earth metal content of less than or equal to 1 g/kg, as described in the application entitled " Process for preparing a chlorohydrin by chlorinating a<br><br>
polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbon ", filed in the name of SOLVAY SA on the same day as the present application, and whose content is incorporated here by reference. The alkali metals may be selected from lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium and caesium and the alkaline earth metals may be selected from magnesium, calcium, strontium and barium.<br>

Among such metals consideration may be given to iron, nickel, chromium, copper, lead, arsenic, cobalt, titanium, vanadium, tin, tellurium, cadmium, antimony, mercury, selenium, zinc, aluminium, and bismuth.

Said content is generally greater than or equal to 0.1 ^ig/kg.<br>
In one particular embodiment of the process according to the invention, the polyhydroxyiated aliphatic hydrocarbon, the ester of polyhydroxyiated aliphatic hydrocarbon or the mixture thereof contains an amount of heavy compounds<br><br>
other than the polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbon and whose boiling temperature under a pressure of 1 bar absolute is at least 15°C greater than the boiling temperature of the chlorohydrin of less than or equal to 50 g/kg.<br>
in this particular embodiment the heavy compounds may be selected from fatty acids, their salts, their esters and mixtures thereof.<br>
The fatty acids contain preferably at least 12 carbon atoms. Fatty acids and mixtures of fatty acids derived from vegetable oils and animal fats are preferred. Fatty acids and fatty acid mixtures derived from colza oil, sunflower oil, soybean oil and palm oil are particularly preferred. Oleic, linoleic, linolenic, palmitic and stearic acids and mixtures thereof are very particularly preferred. Oleic, linoleic and linolenic acids and mixtures thereof are especially suitable.<br>
The salts of fatty acids are often alkali metal salts, alkaline earth metal salts and ammonium salts or mixtures thereof, and more particularly sodium, potassium and calcium salts.<br>
The fatty acid esters may be selected from mono-, di- and triglycerides and the methyl esters of fatty acid, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Without wishing to be tied by any particular theoretical explanation, it is thought that the heavy compounds present in the polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbon, the ester of polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbon or the mixture thereof accumulate in the recycled streams and make it necessary to increase the frequency of purge operations.<br>
In the process for preparing a chlorohydrin according to the invention, the heavy compounds content of the polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbon, the ester of polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbon or the mixture thereof is preferably less than or equal to 30 g/kg, with more particular preference less than or equal to 10 g/kg, with still more particular preference less than or equal to 1 g/kg and with very particular preference less than or equal to 0.5 g/kg.<br>
It is found that, by using a polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbon containing not more than 4 g/kg of heavy compounds as defined above, it is possible to reduce the volume of the purges.<br>
In the process for preparing a chlorohydrin according to the invention, the polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbon, the ester of polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbon or the mixture thereof may be as specifically disclosed in application WO 2005/054167 of SOLVAY SA from page 2 line 8 to page 4 line 2.<br><br>
In the process for preparing a chlorohydrin according to the invention, the polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbon, the ester of polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbon or the mixture thereof may or may not have undergone one or more purification treatments between its preparation and its use in the process according to the invention. Such treatments may be as described in application WO 2005/054167 of SOLVAY SA on page 3 lines 4 to 14 and lines 30 to 33.<br>
Particular mention is made of purification treatments such as distillation, evaporation, extraction, adsorption or concentration operations followed by separating operations such as decantation, filtration or centrifugation. Mention is also made of purification operations by treatment with resins, preferably ion exchange resins.<br>
Preference is given to using a polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbon, an ester of a polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbon or a mixture thereof which has not undergone such treatments.<br>
When the polyhydroxylated aliphatic hydrocarbon is glycerol, it is preferred to use a glycerol obtained by a process of transesterification starting from renewable raw materials in the presence of a heterogeneous catalyst.<br>
A glycerol of this kind may be obtained, for example, in the conversion of animal or vegetable oils or fats by transesterification in the presence of a heterogeneous catalyst, as described in documents FR 2752242. FR 2869612 and FR 2869613. More specifically, the heterogeneous catalyst is selected from mixed oxides of aluminium and zinc, mixed oxides of zinc and titanium, mixed oxides of zinc, titanium and aluminium, and mixed oxides of bismuth and aluminium, and is employed in the form of a fixed bed. This latter process may be a biodiesel production process.<br>
More particular preference is given to using a glycerol obtained by a process of transesterification starting from renewable raw materials in the presence of a heterogeneous catalyst selected from mixed oxides of aluminium and zinc, mixed oxides of zinc and titanium, mixed oxides of zinc, titanium and aluminium and mixed oxides of bismuth and aluminium in supported and unsupported form and the heterogeneous catalyst is employed in the form of a fixed bed.<br>
This glycerol preparation process presents a number of advantages over processes based on saponification, transesterification or hydrolysis reactions which do not employ a heterogeneous catalyst:<br><br>
A first advantage is that the contamination of the glycerol by metals is reduced. These metals may be alkali metals and/or alkaline earth metals originating, for example, from the basic reagents used in the saponification reactions (alkaline bases), in neutralizing operations using alkaline bases, or metals originating from homogeneous acidic catalysts used in transesterification or acidic hydrolysis reactions, or else metals originating from the corrosion of the glycerol preparation apparatus. The use of heterogeneous catalysts as described above makes it possible to reduce significantly the contamination of the glycerol by alkali metal and alkaline earth metal elements, and also by other metallic elements.<br>
A second advantage is that the contamination of the glycerol by Matter (Organic) Non-Glycerol (MONG) is reduced. This matter (organic) non-glycerol contributes to a not insignificant extent to the heavy compounds as defined earlier on above, and include, for example, carboxylic acids, fatty acid esters such as the mono-, di- and triglycerides and the esters of fatty acids with the alcohols used in the transesterification. The MONG content of the glycerol in accordance with standard ISO 2464 (1973) is obtained by the following formula : MONG (%) = 100 - [GLC] - [H2O] - [dry residue] where<br>
[GLC] is the glycerol content of the glycerol (in %) as in the standardized method oflSO 2879 (1975)<br>
