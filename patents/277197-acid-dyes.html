<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
either in position m (meta) or p (para). In very particularly preferred compounds of the formula (I) the radical of the formula (I') is p (para) attached to the radical of the formula (I").<br>
The invention also provides a process for preparing compounds of the formula (I). The present invention's compounds of the formula (I) can be prepared under conventional conditions in conventional processes.<br>
In these processes, compounds of the formula (II)<br>
<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
which are known from the literature and in which SG is a protective group such as acetyl for example and the other substituents are each as defined above, are conventionally diazotized and coupled onto one equivalent of a compound of the formula (III)<br>
<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
where the substituents are each as defined above and after the protective group SG has been removed (by hydrolysis) the amine of the formula (IV)<br>
<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
is conventionally diazotized and coupled at acidic pH onto one equivalent of a compound of the formula (V)<br>
<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
It is similarly possible to proceed by a process wherein first the compound of the formula (II')<br>
<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
is conventionally diazotized and coupled at acidic pH onto one equivalent of a compound of the formula (V)<br>
<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
and after the protective group SG has been removed (by hydrolysis) the amine of the formula (IV)<br>
<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
 is conventionally diazotized and coupled onto one equivalent of a compound of the formula (III)<br>
<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
where the substituents are each as defined above.<br>
The dyes of the formula (I) can be isolated from the reaction medium by conventional processes, for example by salting out with an alkali metal salt, filtering and drying, if appropriate under reduced pressure and at elevated temperature.<br>
Depending on the reaction and/or isolation conditions, the dyes of the formula (I) can be obtained as free acid, as salt or as mixed salt which contains for example one or more cations selected from alkali metal ions, for example the sodium ion, or an ammonium ion or alkylammonium cation, for example mono-, di- or trimethyl- or -ethylammonium cations. The dye can be converted by conventional techniques from the free acid into a salt or into a mixed salt or vice versa or from one salt form into another. If desired, the dyes can be further purified by diafiltration, in which case unwanted salts and synthesis by-products are separated from the crude anionic dye.<br>
The removal of unwanted salts and synthesis by-products and partial removal of water from the crude dye solution is carried out by means of a semipermeable membrane by applying a pressure whereby the dye is obtained without the unwanted salts and synthesis by-products as a solution and if necessary as a solid body in a conventional manner.<br>
The dyes of the formula (I) and their salts are particularly suitable for dyeing or printing fibrous material consisting of natural or synthetic polyamides in yellow to violet shades. The dyes of the formula (I) and their salts are suitable for producing Inkjet printing inks<br>
 and for using these Inkjet printing inks to print fibrous material which consists of natural or synthetic polyamides or cellulose (paper for example).<br>
The invention accordingly provides from another aspect for the use of the dyes of the formula (I), their salts and mixtures for dyeing and/or printing fibrous materials consisting of natural or synthetic polyamides. A further aspect is the production of Inkjet printing inks and their use for printing fibrous materials consisting of natural or synthetic polyamides.<br>
Dyeing is carried out as per known processes, see for example the dyeing processes described in Ullmanns Encyklopadie der technischen Chemie, 4th Edition, 1982, Volume 22, pages 658-673 or in the book by M. Peter and H.K. Rouette, Grundlagen der Textilveredlung, 13th Edition, 1989, pages 535-556 and 566-574. Preference is given to dyeing in the exhaust process at a temperature of 30 to 140Â°C, more preferably 80 to 120Â°C and most preferably at a temperature of 80 to 100Â°C, and at a liquor ratio in the range from 3:1 to 40:1.<br>
The substrate to be dyed can be present in the form of yarn, woven fabric, loop-formingly knitted fabric or carpet for example. Fully fashioned dyeings are even permanently possible on delicate substrates, examples being lambswool, cashmere, alpaca and mohair. The dyes of the invention are particularly useful for dyeing fine-denier fibres (microfibres).<br>
The dyes according to the present invention and their salts are highly compatible with known acid dyes. Accordingly, the dyes of the formula (I), their salts or mixtures can be used alone in a dyeing or printing process or else as a component in a combination shade dyeing or printing composition together with other acid dyes of the same class, i.e. with acid dyes possessing comparable dyeing properties, such as for example fastness properties and exhaustion rates from the dyebath onto the substrate. The dyes of the present invention can be used in particular together with certain other dyes having suitable chromophores. The ratio in which the dyes are present in a combination shade dyeing or printing composition is dictated by the hue to be obtained.<br>
The novel dyes of the formula (I), as stated above, are very useful for dyeing natural and synthetic polyamides, i.e. wool, silk and all nylon types, on each of which dyeings having a high fastness level, especially good light fastness and good wet fastnesses (washing, alkaline perspiration) are obtained. The dyes of the formula (I) and their salts have a high rate of exhaustion. The ability of the dyes of the formula (I) and their salt to build up is likewise very good. On-tone dyeings on the identified substrates are of outstanding quality. All dyeings moreover have a constant hue under artificial light. Furthermore, the fastness to decating and boiling is good.<br>
One decisive advantage of the novel dyes is that they are metal free and provide very level dyeings.<br>
The compounds according to the invention can be used as an individual dye or else, owing to their good compatibility, as a combination element with other dyes of the same class having comparable dyeing properties, for example with regard to general fastnesses, exhaustion value, etc. The combination shade dyeings obtained have similar fastnesses to dyeings with the individual dye.<br>
The invention's dyes of the formula (I) can also be used as red components in trichromatic dyeing or printing. Trichromatic dyeing or printing can utilize all customary and known dyeing and printing processes, such as for example the continuous process, exhaustion process, foam dyeing process and Ink-Jet process.<br>
The composition of the individual dye components in the trichromatic dye mixture used in the process of the invention depends on the desired hue. A brown hue for example preferably utilizes 20 - 40% by weight of a yellow component, 40 - 60% by weight of the invention's orange or red component and 10 - 20% by weight of a blue component.<br>
The yellow component, as described above, can consist of a single component or of a mixture of different orange individual components conforming to the formula (I). Preference is given to double and triple combinations.<br>
Particularly preferred red and/or yellow components are described in WO2002/46318.<br>
In the examples which follow, parts and percentages are by weight and temperatures are reported in degrees Celsius.<br>
Preparation Example 1<br>
15.0	parts of 4-aminoacetanilide were introduced into a mixture of 50 parts of ice and<br>
25 parts by volume of approximately 30% hydrochloric acid and stirred for about<br>
30 min. At 0-5Â°C 17.3 parts by volume of a 40% sodium nitrite solution were then added dropwise within 30 min. The temperature was maintained at 0-5Â°C during the addition by addition of ice. After the diazotization had ended, excess sodium nitrite was destroyed with aminosulphonic acid.<br>
29.1	parts of 3-[(ethylphenylamino)methyl]benzenesulphonic acid were suspended in<br>
200 parts of water. The suspension was adjusted to pH 7-7.5 with sodium carbonate.<br>
The diazo suspension was then added in the course of 30 min with vigorous stirring.<br>
During the addition, the pH was maintained at about 7 by metered addition of sodium<br>
carbonate solution.<br>
After the coupling reaction had ended, 50 parts by volume of an approximately 30% aqueous sodium hydroxide solution were added and the reaction mixture was heated to 90 - 100Â°C. The reaction was monitored by thin layer chromatography. After about 24 h, the deacetylation had ended. The resulting compound of the formula<br>
<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
was filtered off.<br>
A suspension of 34.4 parts of 2-(2',6'-dimethylphenylamino)-8-hydroxynaphthalene-6-sulphonic acid in 200 parts of water was admixed, at about 20 - 25Â°C and a pH between<br>
1 and 2, with a diazonium salt solution prepared in a conventional manner from 41.0 parts of the aminoazo compound (I) and 17.3 parts by volume of a 40% sodium nitrite solution at 0-5Â°C. After coupling had ended, the resulting dye of the formula<br>
<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
was salted out with sodium chloride, filtered off and dried at 50Â°C under reduced pressure. On wool and in particular on polyamide fibres it produces blue dyeings having good light and wet fastness properties (lamda(max) (Amax)= 588 nm).<br>
Examples 2-53<br>
The table which follows contains dyes which can be prepared similarly to the method described in Example 1 by using the corresponding starting materials. These dyes provide blue dyeings having very good light and wet fastnesses on polyamide fibres and wool.<br>

0.2 part of the dye of Preparation Example 1 is dissolved in 100 parts of hot water and the solution is cooled down to room temperature. This solution is added to 100 parts of chemically bleached sulphite pulp beaten in 2000 parts of water in a Hollander. After 15 minutes of commixing the stuff is sized with resin size and aluminium sulphate in a<br>
 conventional manner. Paper produced from this stuff has a blue shade with good wet fastnesses.<br>
Use Examples I and J can also be carried out with dyes 2 to 53 with similar results.<br>
