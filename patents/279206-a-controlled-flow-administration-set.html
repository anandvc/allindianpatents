				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a flow control device. More parlicularty the invention relates to a How control device particularly, but not necessarily exclusively. tor use in an intravenous (IV) administration set. to an orifice plate for a (low control device and to a component lor an IV administration set.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTrON<br>
At presenl- infusion of fluids into a patient is managed bv medical personnel. fluids are infused parenterally into a patient for a variety of reasons. It is often critical that the fluid being administered is infused into the patient's bt&gt;dy in the required doses and flow rales.<br>
fhis is usually done either manually using a roller clamp or automalically using an infusion pump, Manual roller clamps are inaccurate and are difficult to set to maintain an accurate flow rate. In addition, when applied to a length of plastics conduit, the plastics conduit itself may. in due course. plastically deform resulting in a loss of clamping action of the roller clamp. This could have the potentially serious consequences of an unregulated supply of fluid into the patient's body.<br>
Infusion pumps, while maintaining an accurate How rate, are expensive items. In addition, because an inllision pump is an electromechanical device, there is a risk of failure of the infusion pump which, once again, has potentially extremely serious consequences, further, with the increasing age of the population there is more prcssure for bed places in hospitals resulting in an increasing homecare market. providing homecare patients with infusion pumps is expensive and has attendant risks as well. In addition. in large parts of the world, there are insufficient funds to make infusion pumps available to patients, whether in hospitals or in homecare.<br>
Also, in the case of roller clamps, there is a continuous need for vigilance by medical personnel to ensure that the fluid is being infused at the desired How rate. Often, in parts of (he world, medical personnel are in short supply and are unable to provide the requisite duty of caree.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
<br>
