				<td>FIELD QF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to absorbent devices. and more particularly to an improved absorbent device that is vvorn imerlabially by female vvearers for catamenial purposes, incontinence protection, or both.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
All manner and variety of absorbent articles configured for the absorpiion of body fluids such as menses, urine and feces are well known. With respect to feminine protection devices, the art has offered two basic types; sanitary napkins have been developed for external wear about the pudendal region while tampons have been developed for interna! wear within the vaginal cavity for imerruption of menstrual flow therefrom. such tampon devices are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,412,833, entitled "Tampon Applicator", issued to Weigner, et al. on November l, 1983, and U.S. Patent No. 4,413,986, entitled "Tampon Assembly With Means For Sterile Insertion", issued to Jacobs on November 8,1983.<br>
Hybrid devices which attempt to merge the structural features of the sanitary napkins and the tampons into a single device have also been proposed. such hybrid devices are disclosed in U.S, Patent No. 2,092,346, entitled "Catamenial Pad", issued to Arone on September 7, 1937, and U.S. Paient No. 3,905,372, entitkd "Feminine Hygiene Protective Shield", issued to Denkinger on September 16,1975. Other less intrusive hybrid devices are known as labial or interlabial sanitary napkins and are characterized by having a portion vvhich at least partially resides within the vveareťs vestibule and a portion which at least partially resides external of the wearer's vestibule. such devices are disclosed in U,S. Patent No. 2,662,527, entitled "Sanitary Pad", issued to Jacks on December 15, 1953, and U.S. Patent No. 4,631,062, entitled "Labial Sanitary Pad", issued to Lassen, et al. on December 23, 1986.<br>
Interlabial pads have the potential to provide even greater freedom irom inconvenience because of their small size and reduced risk of leakage. Numerous<br>
attempts have 'been made in the past to produce an interlabial pad which would combine the best features of tampons and sanitary napkins while avoiding at least some of the disadvantages associated with each of ihese types of devices. Examples of such devices are described in U.S. Patent 2,917,049 issued to Delaney on December 15, 1959, U.S. Patent 3,420,235 issued to Harmon on January 7, 1969. U.S. Patent 4,595,392 issued to Johnson, et al. on June 17, 1986, and U.S. Patents 5,074,855 and 5336,208 issued to Rosenbluth, et al. on December 24, 1991 and August 9, 1994 respectively, and U.S. Patent 5,484,429 issued to Vukos, et al. on January 16, 1996. A commercially available interlabial device is the "FRESH 'N FIT PADETTE" (also knovvn as "INSYNC" or "INSYNC MiNIFORM") interlabial pad vvhich is marketed by Athena Medical Corp. (now known as-A-Fem) of Poriland, OR and 'described in U.S. Patents 3,983,873 and 4,175,561 issued to Hirschman on October 5, 1976 and November 27, 1979, respectively.<br>
Many of these devices have not niet with great commercial success, howevei. There are drawbacks associated with ail of the above products. For example, the device described in the Delaney patent does not appear to be capable of an easy and comfortable insertion, due to the possibility of the layers of absorbent material opening up during insertion. The commercially available "PADETTE" ( or "INSYNC") interlabial device suffers from the disadvantage that many consumers fmd ii difficult to insert properly and may cause some consumers discomfort especially if not properly inserted. Even when such a device is properly inserted, it may tend to allow by-pass flovv around its edges. such fiow can cause body soiling or panty soiling which many consumers fmd unacceptable. Additionally, previously knovm interlabiai devices such as the "PADETTE" interlabial pad may not reliably cover the urethra and/or the vaginal introitus during alľbody movements (e.g. when tne wearer is squatting). such products may also not be reliably expelled when the wearer urinates.<br>
Therefore, a need exists for an improved interlabial device which will reduce the incidence of body and panty soiling when used. such a device should be easy to insert and be comfortable during vvear. A need exists for an interlabial device which also covers the walls of the weareťs labia throughout a range of body motions and reliably covers the vaginal introitus and preferably also the urethra during such motions. A need also exists for an improved absorbent interlabial device which may be used as part of a system of feminine hygiene protection or with a feminine hygiene kit.<br>
SUMMARY QF THE INVENTION<br>

• DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to an absorbent interlabial device. FIGS. i-3 shows one embodiment of an absorbent interlabial device, interlabial device 20. The present invention, however, is not limited to a structure having the particular configuration shown in the drawings.<br>
As used herein the term "absorbent interlabial device" refers to a structure which has at least some absorbent components, and which is specifically configured to reside within the interlabial space of a female wearer during use. When the absorbent interlabial device 20 is properly sized for an individua! wearer, more than half of the entire absorbent interlabial device 20 of the present invention resides within such interlabial space. Preferably substantially the entire absorbent interlabial device 20 resides within such interlabial space, and more preferably the entire absorbent interlabial device 20 resides uithin such interlabial space of a female wearei during usc.<br>
As used herein, the term "interlabial space" refers to that space in the pudendai region of the female anatomy which is located between the inside surfaces of the labia majora extending into the vestibule. Located within tni s interlabial space are the labia minor, the vestibule and the principal urogenital members including the clitoris, the orifice of the urethra, and the oriilce of the vagina. Standard medical authorities teach that the vestibule refers to the space bounded laterally by the inside surfaces of the labia minora and extending interiorly to the floor between the clitoris and the orifice of the vagina. Therefore, it will be recognized that the interlabial space as defmed above may refer to the space between the inside surfaces of the labia majora, including the space between the inside surfaces of the labia minora also known as the vestibule. The interlabial space for purposes of the present description does not extend substantially beyond the orifice of the vagina into the vagina! interior.<br>
The term "labia" as used herein refers generally to both the labia majora and labia minora. The labia terminate anteriorly and posteriorly at the anterior commissure and the posterior commissure, respectively. It will be recognized by those skilled in the art that there is a wide range of variation among women with respect to the relative size and shape of labia majora and labia minora. For purposes of the present description, however, such differences need not be specifically addressed. It will be recognized that the disposition of the absorbent interlabial<br><br>
device into the'iuterlabial spacc ot'a wcaier JUÄ defined abovŕ wilj require placcment betwecn the inside surtaces ofihe labia majora withoui reftard to thc ptfrcise lucatkm of ihe boundary belween the Jabia m ajmira and the labia minum for a particular wcarer. For a more detaileO description of tri i s portiun of the fcmalc iumtomy, iiuemion is divcciei.l to Gray's Anatomy, Riuuung Press 1901 F,d, (1974), at 1025-1027.<br>
