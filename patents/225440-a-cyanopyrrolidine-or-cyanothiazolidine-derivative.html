				<td>SPECIFICATION<br>
A CYANOPYRROLIDINE OR CYANOTHIAZOLIDINE DERIVATIVE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
 The present invention relates to a novel aliphatic<br>
nitrogen-containing 5-membered ring compound having<br>
superior dipeptidylpeptidase IV (DPPIV) inhibitory action<br>
that is useful as a pharmaceutical.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
 Dipeptidylpeptidase IV (DPPIV) is a kind of serine<br>
protease that specifically hydrolyzes a dipeptide of Xaa-<br>
Pro or Xaa-Ala (where Xaa may be any amino acid) from the N<br>
terminus of a poLypeptide chain.<br>
 There are various reports regarding the role of DPPIV<br>
(also called to as CD26) in the body and its relationship<br>
with diseases (Hoist, et al., Diabetes, Vol. 47, pp. 1663-<br>
1670, 1998; Augustyns, et al., Current Medicinal Chemistry,<br>
Vol. 6, pp. 311-327, 1999; Meester, et al., Immunol, Today,<br>
Vol. 20, pp. 367-375, 1999; and, Fleicher, et al., Immunol,<br>
Today, Vol. 15, PP. 180-184, 1994).<br>
 GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide 1) is a peptide hormone<br>
that mainly acts in the pancreas after being secreted from<br>
the lower small intestine after meals, and primarily has<br>
the function of amplifying glucose-induced insulin secre-<br>
tion. In addition, there are several reports suggesting<br>
that GLP-1 has an appetite-suppressing action. DPPIV<br>
hydroly2es GLP-1, forming an inactive or antagonistic<br>
peptide.<br>
 substances that inhibit the enzyme activity of DPPIV<br>
enhance the insulin secretion response to oral glucose<br>
loading by enhancing the action of intrinsic GLP-1, thereby<br>
improving impaired glucose tolerance.<br>
 Consequently, DPPIV inhibitors are considered to be<br>
useful for the prophylaxis and treatment of diabetes<br><br>
(particularly type 2 diabetes), etc. Also, they are<br>
expected to be effective for the prophylaxis and treatment<br>
of other diseases induced or exacerbated by impaired<br>
glucose tolerance (including hyperglycemia (such as<br>
postprandial hyperglycemia), hyperinsulinemia, diabetes<br>
complications (such as renal disorder and neurological<br>
disorder), lipid metabolism disorder and obesity, etc.).<br>
 Moreover, DPPIV inhibitors are also expected to be<br>
effective for the prophylaxis and treatment of diseases<br>
that are to be improved by enhancing the appetite-suppress-<br>
ing action of GLP-1 (including overeating and obesity,<br>
etc.).<br>
 Also, DPPIV (CD26) present on the surface of T cells<br>
is strongly upregulated following T cell activation, and<br>
plays an important role in the activation and proliferation<br>
of T cells. T cell activity is known to be suppressed when<br>
DPPIV (CD26) is blocked by antibodies or inhibitory sub-<br>
stances. Also, there has been an interest in the correla-<br>
tion between this enzyme and the pathological state in<br>
collagen metabolism disorders and diseases associated with<br>
abnormal immunity. For example, the DPPIV (CD2 6) positive<br>
rate of peripheral blood T cells is elevated in rheumatoid<br>
patients, and high levels of DPPIV activity have been<br>
detected in the urine of nephritis patients. Moreover,<br>
DPPIV (CD26) is also thought to play an important role in<br>
the entry of HIV into lymphocytes.<br>
 Consequently, substances that inhibit DPPIV (CD26)<br>
are expected to demonstrate prophylactic and therapeutic<br>
effects against diseases including autoimmune diseases<br>
(such as arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis), osteoporosis,<br>
acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and rejections of<br>
transplanted organs and tissues.<br>
 On the other hand, as compounds having DPPIV inhibit-<br>
ory action, there are described 2-cyanopyrrolidine deriva-<br>
tives having DPPIV inhibitory action in International<br>
Patent Laid-Open Publications Nos. WO98/19998 and<br><br>
 The present invention provides a novel aliphatic<br>
nitrogen-containing 5-membered ring compound having an<br>
excellent DPPIV inhibitory action.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>

problems, the present inventors found a novel aliphatic<br>
nitrogen-containing 5-membered ring compound having DPPIV<br>
inhibitory action, thereby accomplished the present<br>
invention.<br>
 Namely, the present invention relates to an aliphatic<br>
nitrogen-containing 5-membered ring compound represented by<br>
the formula [I] :<br><br>

hydroxy lower alkyl group or a lower alkoxy lower<br>
alkyl group,<br>
X represents -N(R3)-, -O- or -CO-, where R3 repre-<br>
sents hydrogen atom or a lower alkyl group, and<br>
R2 represents (1) a cyclic group which may be<br>
substituted, where the cyclic group portion is<br>
(1)	a monocyclic, bicyclic or tricyclic hydrocarbon<br>
