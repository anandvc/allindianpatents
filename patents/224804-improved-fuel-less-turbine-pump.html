				<td>This invention relates to improved fuel less turbine pump cum power take off machine for the development of new simple and low cost energy conversion and utilization apparatus which may be called "FUEL-LESS TURBINE PUMP- CUM POWER TAKE OFF MACHINE".<br>
There is no need to stress upon the importance and necessity for research and development of harnessing alternative energy resources more particularly in remote rural areas and lifting water for agricultural and other jobs allied sector. It is preferable to harness a source of energy which is naturally available because with such a source the expenditure on energy input is nill and it is mainly on the capital cost of the apparatus. There are large numbers of seasonal and perennial natural water streams in the country whose energy can be harnessed for more importantly lifting water from the streams for irrigation purpose and for other more common rural uses. Energy and water from these streams is freely available resource which can be utilized for production agriculture and rural upliftment.<br>
The invention provides a device or apparatus for converting the energy of flowing stream of water directly into mechanical energy of rotation of a shaft which is coupled with a pump and a power take off pulley to operate any other devices such as atta chakki (grinding mill), Oil Expeller, Chaff Cutter, Thresher, Cane Crusher etc. in local use at village level at low cost. The apparatus developed in this invention is called "Fuel-Less Turbine pump-cum-machine". Some of the advantages of this apparatus may be listed as flows: (a) design of the pump-cum-machine is simple, (b) direct conversion of energy of flowing water into mechanical energy of a rotating shaft, (c) high efficiency firstly due to direct conversion of energy and secondly due to low frictional losses, (d) operation is easy and can be operated by olds, adults or children above 10 yrs, (e) no fuel or electricity is required and operating cost is minimum, (f) speed can be varied by changing the amount of flowing water,<br><br>
(g) cost of construction and installation is low, (h) all types of stationery machines such as water pump, grinding mill, threshing and winnowing machines chaff cutter, cane crusher, wood saw mill can be operated by this apparatus which does not require either fuel or electricity, (i) maintenance is simple and cheap, (j) designed to operate under low steam heads, (k) much less cost of operation, (1) does not create pollution and above all (m) it is sustainable. No such simple device for using energy of small streams and in use in India or abroad.<br>
In accordance with the invention these if provided device called "Fuel-less Turbine Pump-cum-Machine" for converting energy of natural water streams into mechanical energy of rotation and utilizing it for pumping water and other agricultural jobs comprising at least a water wheel which is mounted on a shaft, a suitable gear box for stepping up speed to a sufficient level, a suitable coupling to connect the water shaft and the gear box, water pump and pulley.<br>
The water wheel of the turbine pump-cum-machine is to be installed in seasonal and perennial water streams (river lets) by constructing small check dams which provide certain short falls. On installation, the axis of the wheel is located such that the water stream impacts the rotating plates and at the same time it allows the flowing the water to pass easily towards the down streams. The quantum of the mechanical energy available is according to the level of head and the size of the stream.<br>
The fuel-less machine developed in his invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawing where is combination of water wheel step up gear box pump and belt pulley.<br>
Fig.-l, shows the overall perspective view of the assembly of the "Fuel-less turbine pump-cum-machine".<br>
Referring on Sheet No. 1 Fig. No 1 of the drawing in detail the water wheel (1) is firmly mounted on a shaft (2) which is supported on two bearing blocks (3) fix on foundation support or steel frame according to need. One of the two ends of the shaft is coupled with an input shaft (6) of a gearbox (4) any suitable coupling according to need referring on Sheet No. 2 and 3 serially Fig. No. 1 to 9. Fig. No. 1 direct coupling Fig. No. 2 Connecting Rod, Fig. No. 3 Chain sprocket, Fig No. 4 Bevel Gear, also can be used and step up gear can be installed on sheet No. 3 Fig. No. 5 Single shaft of Water wheel and Input Shaft of Step Up Gear Box and on the other shaft (output) of gear box and pump shaft is also single. This system can be used in any step of gear box according to need. Fig. No. 6 output shaft can be in any direction according to need and output shaft can be one or more Fig. No. 7 universal joint to coupled water wheel shaft and input shaft by one U. J. or more suitability or according to need output shaft the step up gear box with fly wheel one or more and pump shaft by U. J. Fig. No. 8 any suitable clutch/lever can be used to coupled to water wheel shaft and input shaft of step up gear box and out put shaft of step up gear box and pump shaft Sheet No. 1 Fig. No. 1 output shaft (7) of the gear box is coupled with a centrifugal pump (8) through suitable coupling (9) for lifting water or any other machine with a belt pulley (10) for doing the desired type of work. Fig. No. 9 water wheel shaft &amp; input shaft can be coupled by direct 2 gears shown in Sheet No. 3, Fig. No. 9.<br>
All improved arrangements of coupling wheel shaft and input shaft of gear box and output shaft gear box with pump shaft is provided in a very simple way and for reducing the work of installation for getting the maximum energy with maximum efficiency. Step up gear can be installed in bottom or at water level to be carefree from air taking by centrifugal pump and air free from all types of football problems. In rainy season or in any season according to suitability gear box can be install in tower so no danger from flood and there is<br>
no disturbance in power generation whole year clock wised and anti-clockwise any type or both type pump runs at a time. Pump speed is being controlled by regulator and takes desirable discharge of water from pump according to need pumps runs or pumping become start from 500 RPM and iruns till 2500 RPM. Any type of can be used Belt Driven or lowest and highest RPM running pump.<br>
Water wheel is the main part of the apparatus which converts the energy of flowing water into mechanical energy or rotation of the shaft. The Water Wheel of diameter D and Width, W has certain numbers of specially shaped planks mounted radially on circular rimnty frame- water wheel is mounted on a mild steel shaft which rotates at certain speed depending upon the stream when flowing water falls on the radial planks. The water wheel is so designed keeping in view the horse power and speed requirement.<br>
Gear box has been used for stepping up the revolutions to drive centrifugal pump at desired speed. Other speeds are achieved by adjusting the stream size and suitably choosing the pulley size at the output shaft. The size of the gear box is suitably chosen based on speed and power requirement. The type of centrifugal pump can be choosen which are normally used for agricultural purpose.<br>
The Water wheel turbine pump-cum-machine described here is simple in construction and its operation does not require any fuel. Village artisans can easily fabricate the device and it can be installed with the technical skill generally available at village level. For long life of the apparatus iron parts may be suitably painted with non-corrosive chemicals.<br>
Operation of the water wheel is very simple and easy for operating apparatus, the water gate is opened by simply slauce gate provided to check the flow of water. Depending upon the flow of water vis-a-vis required, less or more gate can be opened to vary the torque and speed of the water wheel and<br>
thereby the connected load. At a time two pumps can be operated by utilizing both ends of the output shaft provided in the gear box, belt pulley is utilized for operating other machines. The pumps can be disengaged, if so, required by moving the coupling on either side. To stop the operation, the water gate is closed. The vary the speed, depth of water stream falling on the wheel is varied. For higher speed more depth of water stream is required to be released. Maintenance of the whole apparatus is simple and easy. Regular greasing and oiling of relatively moving parts is required. This will ensure trouble free operation and long life of the apparatus. Gear oil may be changed from time to time for trouble free operation and long life of the apparatus, as recommended in operator's manual.<br>
