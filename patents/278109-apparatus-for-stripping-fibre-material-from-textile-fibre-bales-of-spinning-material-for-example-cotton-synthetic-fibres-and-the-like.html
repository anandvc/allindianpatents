5 	Apparatus for stripping fibre material from textile fibre<br>
	bales of spinning material, for example cotton, synthetic<br>
	fibres and the like<br>
10 	The- invention relates to an apparatus for stripping<br>
	fibre material from textile fibre bales of spinning<br>
	material, for example cotton, synthetic fibres and the<br>
	like, by means of a milling apparatus or the like, wherein<br>
	a tower, which can be moved to and fro in relation to the<br>
15 	fibre material by means of a carriage, which has a travel<br>
	motor or the like, has at least one boom, which is provided<br>
	with the milling apparatus and which extends in a<br>
	transverse direction to the direction of movement, and the<br>
	boom together with the stripping apparatus can be moved in<br>
20 	the height direction of the tower by means of a lifting<br>
	motor or the like, a movable distance sensor being provided<br>
	for determination of the location in the length direction.<br>
	In a known apparatus (DE-A- 37 22 317), the stripping<br>
	apparatus is provided with sensors which register the<br>
25	distance of the stripping apparatus from a wall or the like<br>
 <br>
- .2 -<br>
	where the row of bales terminates. Control lines lead, to a<br>
	switch-over device or to a control unit by means of which<br>
	the stripping apparatus can be reversed at the end of the<br>
	movement of the stripping apparatus. The sensors are<br>
5	 proximity sensors which iniciate the slowing-down or<br>
	reversal procedure in good time before the wall is reached.<br>
	Using chose sensors it is not possible to ascertain the<br>
	location of the carriage exactly. In addition, it is<br>
	disadvantageous that the sensors nave to act over a<br>
10 	relatively large distance in the horizontal direction in<br>
	order that the travel speed of the heavy machine resulting<br>
	from the substantial weight of the carriage and the tower<br>
	together with the boom, for example 2.8 tonnes, can be<br>
	reliably slowed down in good time without damage. A sensor<br>
15 	that acts in the height direction is not provided because<br>
	neither a slowing-down procedure nor a reversal procedure<br>
	is carried out in the height direction.<br>
		The problem underlying the invention is accordingly to<br>
	provide an apparatus of the kind described at the beginning<br>
20 that avoids the mentioned disadvantages and that especially<br>
	makes possible, by simple means, an exact determination of<br>
	location in the length and/or height direction.<br>
		The problem is solved by the characterising features of<br>
	claim l.<br>
25 .		As a result of the fact that an optical distance sensor<br>
	scans a sloping surface, for example a ramp or the like.<br>
 <br>
- 3 -<br>
large distances are calculate very exactly by means of<br>
	relatively small distance measurements. It is especially<br>
	advantageous that for measurement of just small distances<br>
	economically priced distance sensors can be used. In<br>
5	 addition, distance measurement performed over a short<br>
	distance is more exact (focussed) because scattered light<br>
	losses are minimised. Mounting of the optical distance<br>
	sensors is simple. Overall, position detection [location<br>
	determination) that is maintenance-free and free from wear<br>
10	 is made possible. Irrespective of the position and the work<br>
	region in which the machine is located, the control<br>
	(evaluation device) calculates the position (location) of<br>
	the lower carriage or removal device immediately after the<br>
	machine has been switched on. Finally, no slippage is<br>
15	 present.<br>

	invention.<br>

		The apparatus 1 for stripping fibre tufts, for example a<br>
	Triitzschler BLENDOMAT BDT 019 has, in accordance with<br>
	Figs. 1a and 2a., a. tower 2 on a carriage 10, which travels<br>
	to and fro in the direction of arrows A, B parallel to a<br>
15	 row of bales 3, on one side of the tower 2, a laterally<br>
	cantilevered stripping element 4 is connected to the<br>
	tower 2. The stripping element 4 comprises two stripping<br>
	rollers 5, 6 (high-speed milling rollers) that rotate in<br>
	opposite directions. The stripping element 4 is mounted on<br>
20 	the movable tower 2 by way of a holding device 7. The fibre<br>
	tufts taken off by the stripping rollers 5, 6 are drawn off<br>
	under section through a material removal port 8 and a<br>
	suction line 9, which co-operates with a suction duct 11.<br>
	The surface of the row of bales 3 is stripped horizontally,<br>
25 	The stripping element 4 having the associated milling<br>
 <br>
- 6 -<br>
device is mounted on the tower 2 so as to be movable in the<br>
	height direction in accordance with arrows C, D.<br>
		In accordance with Fig. 1b, there is arranged on the<br>
	spinning room floor a stationary ramp 23 which has a<br>
5	 horizontal base surface 23b and a sloping surface 23a<br>
	arranged at an acute angle a (see Fig. 1c) to the base<br>
	surface 23b. The ramp 23 is arranged to the side of the<br>
	carriage 10 and the suction duct 11. The length 1 extends<br>
	over the length of the machine and is greater than the<br>
10	 length of the row of bales 3, for example 30 m. Mounted on<br>
	the side of the carriage 10, which is movable in the<br>
	direction of arrows A, B, and above the sloping surface 23a<br>
	is an optical distance sensor 24, for example an infra-red<br>
	sensor, the beam path of which is directed at the sloping<br>
15	 surface 23a. AP1 denotes the starting point, S1 denotes the<br>
	location and EP1 denotes the end point. Fig. 1c shows<br>
	calculation of the location S1, wherein:<br>
		x = distance between the distance sensor 24 and the<br>
			base surface 23b.<br>
20		 α = angle of inclination between the base<br>
			surface 23b and the sloping surface 23a,<br>
		y = distance between the distance sensor 24 and the<br>
			sloping surface 23a,<br>

			distance sensor 24 from the base surface 23b<br>
			and from the sloping surface 23a,<br>
		b = distance of the location S1 from the starting<br>
5			paint AP1.<br>
		The values of x and α are fixed, prespecified values.<br>
	The values of y a and b are dependent on the location S1.<br>
	The straight lines a and b are arranged at a right angle<br>
	with respect to one another. Calculation of the value of b<br>
10	 and, as a result, the location S1 is carried out in three<br>
	calculation stages;<br>
 <br>
15 		The calculation is performed in the electronic control<br>
	and regulation device 21, for example a microcomputer (see<br>
	Fig. 4).<br>
		The distance sensor 24 (light scanner) consists of a<br>
	light transmitter 24a and a light receiver 24b. The beam of<br>
20	 light 24 emitted by the light transmitter 24a is reflected<br>
	by the smooth surface of the sloping surface 23a, and the<br>
	reflected beam of light 24 is received by the light<br>
	receiver 24b.<br>

	with the tower 2, is movable to and fro along rails 12 in<br>
	the directions A, B. Reference numeral 13 denotes a travel<br>
	motor for driving the travel wheels 14, 15 of the<br>
5	 carriage 10, together with the tower 2, in the length<br>
	direction. The holding device 7 supporting the stripping<br>
	element 4 is suspended from a counterweight 13 by way of a<br>
	rope passing around guide rollers 16, 17, a lifting<br>
	motor 19 enabling the height of the remval element 4 to be<br>
10 	changed by means of transmission elements 20, 20a (for<br>
	example, chains) and the guide rollers 16a, 16b (for<br>
	example, chain wheels). The displacement path of the<br>
	stripping element 4 in the height direction (arrows C, D)<br>
	and the lengthwise movement (arrows A, B) of the carriage<br>
15 	10 together with the tower 2 resulting from the travel<br>
	motor 13 are matched to one another by means of a control<br>
	device 21 end control lines 22.The stripping element 4 is<br>
	fastened to the holding device 7. The tower 2 is arranged<br>
	on the carriage 10 so that it is rotatable about a vertical<br>
20 	axis. The suction line 9 opens .out into a suction duct 11<br>
	located in a stationary position on the floor between the<br>
	rails 12a, 12b.<br>
		In accordance with Fig. 2b, there is mounted on the<br>
	tower 2 a ramp 25, which has a vertical base surface 25b<br>
25 	and a sloping surface 25a arranged at an acute angle β to<br>
