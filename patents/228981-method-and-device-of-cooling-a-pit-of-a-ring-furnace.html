CHAMBER FURNACE PIT COOLING METHOD MP DEVICE<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The invention relates to the field of so-called 'ring furnaces" for firing carbonaceous blocks, and particularly open type chaiuber furnaces. The invention relates more specifically to a method and a device to cool the pits of such furnaces before servicing and maintenance operations,<br>
State of the art<br>
Open rype ring furnaces are well known themselves and are particularly disclosed in the French patent applications PR 2 600 152 (corresponding 1:0 the American oatent US 4 859 175): and PR 2 535 834 (corresponding to the British application G3 2 129 918).<br>
A ring furnace comprises a succession of aligned chambers, each chamber comprising a plurality .of elongated pits separated by hollow heating partitions,. .<br>
A carbonaceous block firing cycle, for a given chamber, typically comprises the loading of -che pits of said chamber with unprocessed carbonaceous blocks, heating of said chamber to the carbonaceous block firing temperature (typically from 1100 to 1200°C). cooling of the chamber to a temperature enabling the removal of the fired carbonaceous blocks and cooling of the chamber to ambient temperature- The ring furnace principle consists of successively performing the heating cycles on the chambers of the furnace by moving<br><br>
rhe heating means  (such as burner rainps)  and the suction means-<br>
In this way, a given chamber passes successively through preheating, firing and cooling periods-Typically, a dozen chambers are "active" ar the same uime; four in a so-called cooling zone, three in a so-called heating zone, and three in a so-called preheating zone. The active chambers form what is referred to as a "fire".<br>
However, rhe pit cooling times af^er "Che removal of the carbonaceous blocks, which are very long, limit the productivity of the furnaces when actions are required on the furnace, particularly the replacement of partitions, since it is not possible, for health reasons, to have operators work inside the pits before the temperature of the walls is less than approximately 30^C, which requires waiting periods generally greater 'than 3 days.<br>
Therefore, the applicant researched simple means that could be industrialised to accelerate pit cooling,<br>
Descriotion of the invention<br>
■III  _     —<br>
The invention relates to a ring furnace pit cooling method characterised in that it comprises the production of a flux F of cooling fluid inside the pit and in that at least a part Fr of said flux F flows in a roughly vertical manner along determined surfaces of the walls of the pit.<br>
The invention also relates to a ring furnace pit cooling device characterised in that it com.prises:<br><br>
-	at least one first means capable of producing a flux F of cooling fluid inside nhe piZr such as a ventilation means;<br>
-	at least one second means capable of inducing a roughly vertical flow of ar least a part Fr of said flux F along determined surfaces of the walls of the pit, such as a confinement means.<br>
The invention also relates to a ring furnace pic cooling method using the device according to the invention.<br>
The applicant observed that the roughly vertical flow of rhe cooling fluid flux in the vicinity of the pit walls made it. possible to accelerate the cooling rate of said pit considerably.. In this way, the invention may make it possible, in certain cases, to remove one chamber per fire in an industrial scale furnace.<br>
The invention will be understood more clearly using the figures and detailed description below.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates a partially exploded perspective view of a ring furnace-<br>
Figure 2 illustrates a top view {Z axis) of a ring furnace section.<br>
Figure 3^ illustrates an embodimenr of the device according to the invention, in the standby position; (a) viewed on the narrow side [X axis) and lb) viewed from the wide side (Y axis).<br>
Figure 4 illustrates an embodiment of the device according  to  the  invention,   in  the  extended position, (a)  viewed on the narrow side . (X axis) and (b) viewed from the wide side (y axis).<br><br>
Figures 5 and 6 illustrate the movement of cooling fluid flux obtained with the preferred eiribodiment: of the device according to the invention.<br>
As illustrated in figures 1 and 2, a ring furnace comprises a succession of chambers 10, 11, 12, etc-arranged in series. Each chamber comprises an alternation, in Lhe transversal direction (Y axis), of elongated pits 2 and hollow heaning partitions 3 arranged in the Longitudinal direction (X axis). As an illustration, the dotted line 1 in figure 1 delimits one of the chambers and shows that it comprises several pits 2 arranged in parallel and separated by partitions 3.<br>
The pits 2 are delimited by heating partitions 3r transversal wall pillars 4 and a floor 24, The heating partitions 3 and the transversal wall pillars 4 form roughly vertical walls 2A, 2B; the floor 24 forms a roughly horizontal base 2C. The ends of the heating partitions 3 generally comprise transversal walls' 5 equipped with openings^ 6. The heating pa.rtitions 3 ' comprise thin lateral walls 9 generally separated by struts 7 and baffles 8, The hearing partitions 3 are equipped with ' access means 20 referred to as 'peepholes" which are particularly used to introduce heating means (such as burner injectors) (not shown) or suction means 21, 22. The components 2, 3, 4, 5; 24 of the furnace are formed of heat-resistant materials, typically using refractory bricks. Each pit 2 is typically 5 m deep.<br><br>
Figure 1 shows a typical stack of carbonaceous blocks 31 in a pit 2, with a coating powder 32, during a firing operation of said blocks.<br>
The chambers form a long section in the C direction of the fire, A ring furnace typically comprises two parallel sections, each being, of rhe order of one hundred metres long. The sections are generally delimited by sidewalls 23,<br>
During the firing operations, a •gaseous flow composed of air, heating gas, vapours released by the carbonaceous blocks or combusi:ion gas (or most frequently a mixture of said substances) circulates, along the furnace (X axis), in a succession of hollow heating partitions 3 which communicate with each other. This gaseous flow is blown upstream from the active chambers and aspirated downstream from said cham^bers. The heat produced by the combustion of the gases is transmitted to the carbonaceous blocks 31 contained in the pit 2, inducing their firing.<br>
«<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
According to the invention, the ring method of cooling a pit 2 of a ring furnace, said pit 2 comprising walls 2A, 23, is characterised in that it comprises the production of a flux F of cooling fluid inside the pit 2 and in that at least a part Fr of said flux F flows in a roughly vertical manner along determined surfaces of the walls 2A, 23 of the pit 2,<br>
The inside of the pit corresponds to the space normally occupied by carbonaceous blocks 31 and the coating powder or 'packing material" 32 during firing.<br><br>
A roughly vertical flow refers to a flow for which the vertical components of the flux F of gas is considerably greater than the horizontal components (typically approximately ten times greater), so as to maximise the flux of thermal energy extracted from the walls and evacuated outside the pit. Said flow is preferentially low in turbulence, and even more preferentially roughly laminar. Said vertical flow may be upward or downward.<br>
Said flux F is typically a forced fluX; which is produced for example by blowing or suction of cooling fluid.<br>
Said part Fr of said flux F circulates typically in a so-call ^'flow" cross-sect ion S in the vicinity of the walls of the pit, with a rapid flow of said cooling fluid in a roughly parallel direction to said walls. The flux Fr preferentially circulates in a restricted volume V, in the vicinity of said walls, which makes it possible to pbtain an effective evacuation of the heat from the walls for acceptable fluid flow rates (typically between 1 and 10 Nm-^/s.) .<br>
Said flux F typically comprises two main components, i.e. said part Fr, which ^^licks" the walls of the pit, and a part Fo, which introduces cooling fluid into the pit. In the preferred embodiment of the invention, the fluxes Fr and Fo are roughly parallel and circulate in opposite directions, as illustrated in figure 6. The flow rates of Fr and Fo are typically roughly identical.<br>
The cooling fluid is preferentially a gas, or a mixture of gases. It is advantageous to use air to<br><br>
limir operating costs, i-e, said fluid contains air. The cooling fluid is advantageously humid, . i.e» it contains water (typically in the form of vapour or fine droplets) , so as to increase its specific heat capacity. The moisture level of the fluid may be adjusted, for example as a function of the pit wall temperature. In a preferred alrernarive embodiment of the invention, said fluid comprises a mixture of air and moisture. Typically, the fluid which is injected in the pit is air at ambient temperature with varying moisture content -<br>
The cooling fluid flux may be in an open circuity in that it is evacuated in the ambient atmosphere after having absorbed part of the heat from the walls of a pit during its flow inside said pit.<br>
According to the invention, the device 100 for cooling a pit 2 of a ring furnace; said pit 2 comprising walls 2A, 2B and a bass 2C, is characterised in that it co.mprises:<br>
at least one first means 101 capable ■ of producing a flux ? of cooling fluid inside the pit 2/<br>
at least one second means 102 capable of inducing a roughly vertical flow of at least a part ?r of said flux F along determined surfaces of the walls 2A, 2B of the pit 2.<br>
Said first means 101 is typically a ventilation meansr such as a suction or a blowing means.<br>
Said second means 103 is advantageously a so-called 'confinement" means, capable of reducing the flow cross-section S of said flux F in the vicinity of the pit walls, so as to induce a rapid flow of said<br><br>
fluid in a roughly parallel direction to said walls. The flux F circulates in rhis case in a restricted volume V in the vicinity of said walls-<br>
The flow cross-section S is approximately equal to L X P^ where L is.the confinement widrh and P is the average inner perimeter of the pit. The width L is preferentially between 5 cmi and 25 cm, and more preferentially between 10 cm and 20 cm. An insufficient width results in significant pressure drops. An excessive width results in an insufficient flow velocity/ and, as a result, an insufficient coding rate.<br>
Preferentially, the confinement of said flux F also induces an increase in the - flow velocity Ve of said fluid. The flow velocity of the cooling fluid in said part Fr of said flux F is advantageously between 2 and 20 m/s - An insufficient velocity does not make it possible to reduce the cooling time of a pit in, a beneficial manner♦ A very high flow velocity requires , costly ventilation means and a high-energy consumption. The fluid flow rate of said flux is typically between I and 10 Nm^/s for .industrial furnaces.<br>
The confinement means 103 is typically a duck, such as a rigid or flexible duck or a flexible tube, wherein a first end is joined to said (or to each said) ventilation means 101 and wherein a second end 104 may ' be placed inside the pit 2. In this case, the cooling fluid, which is moved using the ventilation means 101, is guided by the duck and injected into the pit (or aspirated from said pit) by at least one opening located at said second end 104. The duck restricts the<br><br>
flow surface S of said flux by forcing said flux to flow between the surface of said duck and said walls 2A/ 2B,<br>
The  confinement  means  103  are  advantageously .<br>
removable and/or retractable, so as to facilitate the positioning of the device. For example, the confinement means 103 may be a detachable rigid duck (i.e. a duck which can be detached from the device 100) which may be positioned in the pit and then connected to the venrilation means ICI of said device.<br>
The confinement means 103 may be connected to the ventilation means 101 using connection means 102.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the confinement means 103 are a retractable tubular duck having at least one retracted position (as illustrated in figure 3) and at least one extended position (as illustra-ed in figure 4). The length of said duck may be variable or adjustable. This embodiment offers the advantage of enabling easy positioning of the device-<br>
As illustrated in figures 3 and 4, the retractable tubular duck may be in the form of bellows (typically if the cross-section is roughly circular or oval) or an accordion (typically if the cross-section is roughly rectangular or square), which facilitates its extension. Said duck may also have other structures, such as a telescopic structure formed of several sections of duck inserted into each other in a sliding manner. The duck 103 may be retracted or extended using extension means 106, 107, such as a motor and cables'.<br>
The duck 103 is preferentially such that it can be extended up to a small distance D from the base 2C of<br><br>
the pitr said distar.ce D being preferentially less than around 50 cm- The distance D is typically of T:he order<br>
of 20 cm.•<br>
The dimensions of the duck are preferentially such that the average distance E between said duck and the walls of the pit is between 5 and 25 cm, and more preferentially between 10 and 20 cm. An insufficient distance results in significant pressure drops which may be detrimental. An excessive distance results in an insufficient flow velocity and, as a result, an insuf ficien":: cooling rate. A distance of approximately 15 cm was found to be very satisfactory.<br>
In an alternative embodiment of the invention, said first means (which are typically ventilation means) may produce a downward flow in the or each said duck and an upward vertical flew along said walls 2A, 2E of the pit 2 * In another alternative embodiment of the invention, said first m^eans may produce an upward flow in the or each said duck and a downward vertical flow along said walls 2A; 2B of the pit 2.<br>
The ventilation means 101 are blowing means, such as a fan, when trying to create an upward flow along the walls 2A, 23 and suction means when trying -o create a downward flow along walls 2A, 2B..<br>
Preferentially, when said vertical flow is upward along walls 2A, 23 of the pit 2 (and therefore downward in the duck(s) ) , the so-called "open" end 104 of the (or each) duck 103 may be equipped with a diffuser 103 capable of favouring an upward deflection of the fluid flux from the duck via said end.     The diffuser is<br><br>
(or each) duck 103 may be equipped wirh a diffuser 108 capable of favouring an upward deflection of the fluid flux from the duck via said end. The diffuser is advantageously such that it reduces pressure drops at the so-called open end 104 of the (or each) duck 103-<br>
The duck is preferentially composed of a flexible, high modulus, material, capable. of resisting temperatures less than or equal to approximately 250"c and the blowing pressure, such as an aromatic polyamide fibre (such as KevlarCD) ♦ Said material may be a composite, such as a multilayer composite. Said material is preferentially tight in order in particular to reduce pressure drops along said duck. In this aiir., said mausrial may be, for example, a multilayer composite comprising a flexible fabric (such as a Kevlar® fabric) and a ::ight layer (such as an aluminium layer). The use of a multilayer composite comprising a flexible layer and an aluminium layer (on the outer surface of the duck) also makes i-:: possible to reflec-the thermal radiation from the pit walls ' and thus prevent excessive heating of the underlying flexible layer.<br>
The device according to the invention 100 is preferentially removable. It comprises advantageously support components 105 used to operate it and position it over a pit.<br>
The device according ro the invention is capable of implementing the cooling method according to the invention.<br>
The device according to the invention may be used for cooling a pit 2 of a ring furnace, and particularly<br><br>
in a method o£ cooling a pit 2 of a ring furnace " coinprising:<br>
-	positioning the cooling device 100 according to the invention;<br>
-	producing a flux of cooling fluid within the pit 2.<br>
In particular, "che device according to the invention may be used in a method of cooling a pit 2 of a ring furnace comprising:<br>
-	positioning the cooling device 100 according to<br>
the invention;<br>
extending   the   confinement   means   103, particularly inside the pit 2 ;<br>
-	producing a flux of cooling fluid using the<br>
ventilation means 101.<br>
These operations are normally performed after the removal of the fired carbonaceous blocks and the packing material contained in the pit.<br>
The extension of the duck may follow ' a predetermined progression or be controlled according- to measurable parameters such as the pit v;all temperature.<br>
Tests<br>
Cooling tests on a ring furnace pit were conducted with a device according to the invention comparable to that represented in figures 3 and 4. In these tests, the pit was 4.76 m deep and has an inner cross-section of 23.7 r??. The cooling fluid was air with varying moisture content, The air flux velocity was typically from 5 to 10 m/s. The air flow raiie was approximately 3 m^/s per fan (and therefore 6 xr?/s in total) . The<br><br>
103 was approximately 15 cm. Tha flux was downwards in the ducks and upwards along the pit walls-<br>
The cooling of the pit was measured using thermocouples plugged into its walls. The initial temperature of the base of the pit was of the order of approximately 130 to 200C, depending on the position in the direction of the fire..<br>
With no cooling device, the time required for Lhe temperature of the base of the pi:: to fall to 20°C was typically 40 hours. With the device according to the invention, it was possible to reduce this time to values of the order of 10 hours.<br>
The device according to the invention proved to generate a low noise level.<br><br><br><br>
