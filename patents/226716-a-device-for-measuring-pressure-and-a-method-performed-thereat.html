Transmitting Pressure Gauge" and filed on January 31, 2003, and a U.S. Utility<br>
Application filed November 26, 2003, entitled "Wireless Transmitting Pressure<br>
Measurement Device".<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The following description relates generally to pressure measurement devices,<br>
and, more particularly, to providing information from pressure measurement devices.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Pressure gauges are widely utilized in a myriad of different environments for<br>
commercial and industrial applications. Typically, pressure gauges measure pressure<br>
and provide an indication of the value. Pressure values are usually displayed in<br>
analog form (e.g., by a pointer) or in digital form (e.g., by an LED readout). Gauges<br>
displaying values in analog form often include a mechanical pressure transducer, such<br>
as a Bourdon tube, that displaces a predictable amount in response to the pressure to<br>
which the transducer is exposed. The displacement is translated via a movement to a<br>
rotatable pointer that moves opposite a dial of calibrated pressure values. Gauges<br>
displaying values in digital form often use an electronic pressure transducer, such as a<br>
piezosensor, that generates an electrical signal in response to the pressure to which the<br>
transducer is exposed. The electrical signal is then converted to a symbol that is<br>
presented on a display.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
In one general aspect, a device for measuring pressure includes a housing, a<br>
transducer, and a data communication device. The housing has an inlet, and the<br>
transducer is coupled to the inlet in the housing to generate an electrical signal<br>
representative of pressure at the inlet. The transducer may, for example, be a piezo-<br><br>
type sensor operable to generate an electrical signal in response to pressure at the<br>
inlet. The data communication device is coupled to the transducer in the housing to<br>
transmit a wireless signal corresponding to the electrical signal, whereby pressure<br>
information is provided remotely. The data communication device may, for example,<br>
be an infrared emitter.<br>
In some implementations, the device includes a visual indicator coupled to the<br>
inlet in the housing to indicate pressure at the inlet. T'hus, the pressure information<br>
may be provided both locally and remotely. The visual indicator may, for instance, be<br>
a digital display.<br>
In particular implementations, the housing includes a stem extending to the<br>
inlet, and the transducer includes a Bourdon tube coupled to the inlet to arcuately<br>
displace in response to pressure at the inlet. The device also includes a visual<br>
indicator having a shaft coupled to the Bourdon tube to rotate in response to<br>
displacement of the Bourdon tube, and a pointer attached to the rotatable shaft to<br>
indicate pressure values,<br>
In certain implementations, the transducer includes an inductive target coupled<br>
to a Bourdon tube, the target being movable in response to displacement of the<br>
Bourdon tube, and an eddy, current sensor positioned to sense movement of the<br>
inductive target and, in response to movement of the inductive target, to generate an<br>
electrical signal representative of pressure at an inlet<br>
In some implementations, the pressure measurement device includes a<br>
processor coupled between the transducer and the transceiver. The processor may<br>
have a variety of operations. For example, the processor may generate pressure<br>
characterization data based on the signal representing pressure at an inlet. The<br>
characterization data may be transmitted as part of a wireless signal and may include<br>
warnings based on the pressure at the inlet. As another example, the processor may<br>
control the frequency at which pressure information is transmitted. The processor<br>
may control the pressure information transmission frequency based on pressure data<br>
set points, the frequency being altered in response to the pressure crossing a pressure<br>
data set point. As a further example, the processor may place itself and other<br>
electronic components into a power conservation mode. As an additional example,<br>
the processor may compensate for non-linearity of the sensed pressure and/or for<br>
temperature coefficients.<br><br>
Particular implementations may include an Infrared Data Association interface<br>
coupled to the processor, wherein the processor may be remotely programmed via the<br>
interface. For example, the processor may be programmed to change pressure data set<br>
points.<br>
Some implementations may include externally accessible terminals coupled to<br>
the processor. The processor may be operable to accept a discrete stains input via the<br>
terminals. Furthermore, the processor may be operable to output pulse accumulation<br>
information via the terminals.<br>
In certain implementations, the pressure measurement device includes a visual<br>
indicator at the housing to indicate mode of operation. A pressure measurement<br>
device may also include a transceiver on-off switch.<br>
In another general aspect, a method performed at a pressure measurement<br>
device includes sensing pressure at an inlet of a housing and converting the sensed<br>
pressure to a visual indication of pressure at the housing. The method also includes<br>
converting the sensed pressure to an electrical signal at the housing and sending a<br>
wireless signal corresponding to the electrical signal from the housing, whereby<br>
pressure information is provided both locally and remotely.<br>
In certain implementations, converting the sensed pressure to a visual<br>
indication of pressure may include converting the sensed pressure to a mechanical<br>
displacement and translating the mechanical displacement to a pointer. Furthermore,<br>
converting the sensed pressure to an electrical signal may include translating the<br>
mechanical displacement to an inductive target and sensing eddy currents generated in<br>
response to displacement of the target. Additionally, sending a wireless signal may<br>
include emitting infrared radiation pulses.<br>
Particular implementations may include additional operations. For example,<br>
some implementations may include generating characterization data for the sensed<br>
pressure based on the electrical signal and sending the characterization data as part of<br>
the wireless signal. As another example, certain implementations may include<br>
controlling the frequency at which pressure information is sent. As a further example,<br>
particular implementations may include placing electronic components into a power<br>
conservation mode. As an additional example, some implementations may include<br>
receiving wireless signals that specify operational adjustments and adjusting pressure<br>
measurement device operations. As another example, certain implementations may<br>
include receiving externally generated data and sending the data as part of the<br><br>
wireless signal. As a further example, particular implementations may include<br>
providing a visual indication of operating mode at the housing.<br>
In another general aspect, a device for measuring pressure includes a housing,<br>
a Bourdon tube, a shaft, and a pointer. The housing has a stem with an inlet, and the<br>
Bourdon tube is coupled to the inlet to arcuately displace in response to pressure at<br>
the inlet. The shaft is mechanically coupled to the Bourdon tube to rotate in response<br>
to displacement of the Bourdon tube, and the pointer is attached to the shaft to<br>
indicate pressure values. The device also includes an inductive target coupled to the<br>
Bourdon tube, the target being movable in response to displacement of the Bourdon<br>
tube, and an eddy current sensor positioned to sense movement of the inductive target<br>
and, in response to movement of the inductive target, to generate an electrical signal.<br>
The device iiirther includes an analog-to-digital converter coupled to the sensor. The<br>
converter is operable to receive the electrical signal and produce a digitized version of<br>
the signal. The device also includes a microprocessor coupled to the converter. The<br>
microprocessor is operable to receive the digitized signal, compensate for non-<br>
linearity of the sensed pressure, compensate for temperature coefficients, and generate<br>
pressure characterization data based on the compensated signal. The microprocessor<br>
is also operable to determine whether the frequency at which pressure information is<br>
transmitted should be adjusted and, if the frequency should be adjusted, adjust the<br>
frequency. The microprocessor is further operable to determine whether it is time to<br>
transmit pressure information, generate a signal including pressure information if it is<br>
time to transmit pressure information, and place itself and other electronic devices<br>
into a power conservation mode. The device additionally includes an Infrared Data<br>
Association interface coupled to the microprocessor, such that the microprocessor<br>
may be remotely programmed via the interface, and an infrared transceiver coupled to<br>
the microprocessor to transmit a wireless signal representative of the microprocessor<br>
signal, whereby pressure information is provided both locally and remotely.<br>
Details of one or more implementations are set forth in the accompanying<br>
drawings and the description below. Other features may be apparent from the<br>
description and drawings, and from the claims.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
FIG. 1 illustrates an example pressure measurement device 10. As illustrated,<br>
pressure measurement device 10 is a pressure gauge; other types of pressure<br>
measurement devices, however, may be used. Device 10 includes a housing 20<br>
having a rear cover 22 and a front cover, which is not shown to assist in illustrating<br>
the internal components of the device. A dial face including pressure values is also<br>
not shown to assist in illustrating the internal components of the device.<br>
In device 10, a pressure sensor 30 is in fluid communication with an inlet 26<br>
of housing 20. Pressure sensor 30 is responsive to pressure at inlet 26 to generate an<br>
electrical output representative of the pressure at inlet 26. Pressure sensor 30 may be<br>
a piezo-type pressure sensor, a capacitive-type pressure sensor, a strain-gauge-type<br>
pressure sensor, or any other appropriate pressure-to-electrical transducer. The<br>
electrical signal output by sensor 30 may represent the pressure by voltage, current,<br>
frequency, pulse width, or any other appropriate electrical signal characteristic.<br>
Device 10 also includes a second transducer — a Bourdon tube 40. Bourdon tube 40,<br>
however, generates an output different from the output of pressure sensor 30.<br>
In response to the pressure at inlet 26, a tip 42 of Bourdon tube 40 displaces<br>
arcuately,. By displacing, tip 42 actuates a link 52 of a movement 50. Movement 50<br>
also includes an amplifier to amplify the displacement motion of link 52. Movement<br>
50 mechanically couples displacement of tip 42 to rotation of a pointer 58, a type of<br>
indicator. Pointer 58, therefore, rotates in response to pressure changes at inlet 26.<br>
When device 10 is fully assembled, pointer 58 may have a pressure-demarcated dial<br>
face opposite.<br><br>
As discussed, device 10 has two transducers, one converting pressure to an<br>
electrical signal, and one converting pressure to mechanical movement. In other<br>
implementations, a pressure measurement device may have any number of<br>
transducers. Moreover, in some implementations, a transducer may provide multiple<br>
outputs.<br>
FIG. 2 further illustrates pressure measurement device 10. As illustrated,<br>
pressure sensor 30, Bourdon tube 40, and movement 50 in FIG. 1 have been removed<br>
to show a printed circuit board (PCB) 60. PCB 60 is electrically coupled via a sensor<br>
connector 62 to pressure sensor 30 in FIG. 1. PCB 60 also includes an analog-to-<br>
digital (A/D) converter 64 to digitize the sensor output and a processor 66 to process<br>
the pressure data indicated via the sensor output. In some implementations, the output<br>
from the sensor is amplified prior to being digitized by A/D converter 64.<br>
Amplification, however, is not required for all implementations.<br>
A/D converter 64 and processor 66 are operatively mounted and preferably<br>
soldered to PCB 60. Processor 66, which may, for example, be a microprocessor,<br>
receives the digital signal from A/D converter 64, the signal being representative of<br>
pressure at the inlet, and generates an output signal including pressure data<br>
corresponding to the digital signal, and, hence, the output of the sensor. Pressure data<br>
may, for example, include indications of sensed pressure.<br>
In particular implementations, the processor output may include<br>
characterization data related to the pressure being measured at inlet 26 in the pressure<br>
data. Characterization data, for example, may include exception reporting or pressure<br>
set points. Table 1 demonstrates exception data.<br><br><br>
The processor output is coupled to a transmitter PCB 70, which is located<br>
between PCB 60 and housing 20. Transmitter PCB 70 includes a transmitter, which is<br>
one type of data communication device, for sending pressure data via a. wireless signal<br>
to a remote location, separate from device 10. Acceptable forms of wireless signals<br>
include radio frequency (RF), infrared (IR), or any other appropriate electromagnetic<br>
regime. Furthermore, the data may be transmitted by amplitude modulation,<br>
frequency modulation, phase modulation, pulse modulation, or any other appropriate<br>
data communication technique. Transmitter PCB 70 may include its own processor to<br>
control wireless communication functions. In particular implementations, transmitter<br>
PCB 70 may also be able to wirelessly receive data from a remote source, possibly by<br>
the use of a transceiver, which is another type of data communication device. A<br>
transceiver may be used in conjunction with or in place of the transmitter.<br>
For power, PCB 60 includes a battery 68. In particular implementations,<br>
battery 68 may facilitate long-term, maintenance-free operation by being a lithium<br>
battery or other long-lasting power source. Use of a long-lasting power source in<br>
combination with remote reporting provides substantial benefits in applications<br>
involving hazardous or hard-to-get-to locations. Note that battery 68 may be mounted<br>
in a variety of locations in housing 20.<br>
Device 10 has a variety of features. For example, pressure data may be<br>
provided at the pressure device and remotely from the pressure device. Thus, field<br>
personnel may determine pressure data at the pressure device, and pressure data may<br>
also be sent to a remote location. This allows for convenient inspection and<br>
monitoring of pressure data. Furthermore, remote monitoring may be important for<br>
hazardous or hard-to-get-to locations. In certain implementations, device 100 may be<br>
CE approved for EMI/RFI compatibility, and may be suitable for Class 1, Div 1<br>
hazardous locations use (i.e., intrinsically safe). Additionally, pressure measurement<br>
by two different transducers, allows for corroboration of pressure data and for<br>
redundancy in case one transducer fails. As a further example, the wireless<br>
transmission components may be incorporated into a standard form factor for a<br>
pressure measurement device, which may provide manufacturing efficiencies.<br>
Furthermore, it may provide commercial advantages, such as, for example, cost<br>
savings through inventory control.<br>
FIGs. 3A-E illustrate a pressure measurement device 100. FIG. 3A shows a<br>
perspective view of device 100, and FIG. 3B shows a side, elevated view of device<br><br>
100. FTGs. 3C-D are end views of device 100, and FIG. 3E is a section taken along<br>
section line E-E of FIG. 3D. Device 100 may be CE approved for EMI/RFI<br>
compatibility, and may be suitable for Class 1, Div 1 hazardous locations use (i.e.,<br>
intrinsically safe).<br>
Device 100 includes a housing 110 having a first end 112 and a second end<br>
114. First end 112 includes an inlet 113 for pressure, and second end 114 includes a<br>
translucent window 119 to facilitate an IR link 160. In particular implementations,<br>
housing 110 is approximately five inches long and three inches in diameter; in other<br>
implementations, it may have any appropriate size.<br>
At first end 112, a pressure fitting 115 is coupled (e.g., by welding) to an<br>
adapter flange 116. Flange 116 contains methodology for the support of interface<br>
electronics, to be discussed below. Flange 116 is then married to housing 110, which<br>
may be non-metallic, through a flat gasket 117, or "O" ring seal, and screws 118. In<br>
another implementation, a threaded flange mated to a threaded housing could be used.<br>
Inlet 113 is in fluid communication with a pressure sensor 120 in housing 110.<br>
Pressure sensor 120 is mounted (e.g., by threading or welding) to pressure fitting 115<br>
and outputs an electrical signal that is representative of the pressure being applied to<br>
the sensor via inlet 113 in pressure fitting 115. Thus, pressure sensor 120 converts<br>
pressure at inlet 113 to an electrical output, similar to pressure sensor 30 in FIG. 1.<br>
Pressure sensor 120 is coupled to a host PCB 130. Coupled to host PCB 130<br>
is a transmitter PCB 140. An infrared LED 150, which may be of any appropriate<br>
type, is located at second end 114 of housing 110 and is electrically coupled to<br>
transmitter PCB 140.<br>
PCB 130 includes a processor 132 that processes signals representing pressure<br>
measurements. The processor, for instance, may generate a code corresponding to the<br>
pressure and/or include secondary pressure data, such as exception reporting.<br>
Predetermined exception conditions, such as, for example, "low pressure" and "high<br>
pressure", may be associated with predefined pulse codes. The processor may have<br>
programming to indicate the exception condition, such as, for example, setting or<br>
clearing a target. Pressure data (e.g., pressure readings and secondary data) may then<br>
be wirelessly transmitted via LED 150 through a series of pulses. Host PCB 130 also<br>
includes an extended-duration power source 134, such as a lithium battery.<br>
In particular implementations, host PCB 130 accepts a low level or a higher<br>
level output (300 mV to approximately 2 V, for example) from pressure sensor 120,<br><br>
performs an analog-to-digital conversion on the signal, and then manipulates the<br>
digitized signal prior to having it transmitted via electromagnetic waves to a<br>
compatible receiver. The receiver may then pass the data to a remote transmitting<br>
unit (RTU) for upload to an established system or communicate the data directly to a<br>
computer or local system via serial communication. There may also be an option for<br>
a local indication of the pressure at device 100, in the form of a digital display, for<br>
example.<br>
To emit pulses (e.g., a series of long and short flashes), transmitter PCB 140<br>
includes a processor 142, which may be controlled by programming stored in<br>
memory. The programming may, for example, search a database, which may also be<br>
stored in memory, for a pulse sequence corresponding to a detected pressure. For<br>
instance, the programming could search a database for a code received from a<br>
microprocessor. The code would have an associated pulse sequence, and processor<br>
142 would cause LED 150 to emit an infrared signal according to the pulse sequence.<br>
IR link 160 may then carry this pressure data to a conventional IR receiver for<br>
interpretation.<br>
In particular implementations, transmitter PCB 140 may include an Infrared<br>
Data Association (IrDA) interface. The IrDA interface may allow data to be<br>
wirelessly communicated two ways between device 100 and an external, separate<br>
computer. The IrDA interface, for example, may locate pulse sequences associated<br>
with the pressure data from processor 132. Furthermore, an external computer may<br>
be used to program device 100 via Link 160. The IrDA interface may be advantageous<br>
because it may be implemented without compromising the housing with a hole, which<br>
may be required for an. external connector for another type of interface, such as, for<br>
example, an RS-232 interface. Furthermore, a programming device may<br>
communicate with the interface by being positioned in the vicinity of the receiving<br>
port, alleviating alignment issues. Note that an RF transceiver could be used for<br>
programming processor 132 in some implementations.<br>
FIGs. 4A-4D illustrate an example PCB assembly 400. FIG. 4A is a front<br>
view of PCB assembly 400. FIG. 4B is aback view of PCB assembly 400. FIG. 4C<br>
is an end view of PCB assembly 400. FIG. 4D is a side view of PCB assembly 400.<br>
PCB assembly 400 may be used for the pressure measurement device in FIG. 1, the<br>
pressure measurement device in FIG. 3, or any other appropriate pressure<br>
measurement device.<br><br>
PCB assembly 400 includes a host PCB 410 and a transmitter PCB 420.<br>
Assembly 400 is powered by a lithium power source 430 mounted on host PCB 410,<br>
which may last between six months to two years at a transmission frequency of once a<br>
minute. Therefore, maintenance-free operation in a hazardous environment may be<br>
achieved for extended durations. The assembly, and perhaps the entire pressure<br>
measurement device of which it is a part, therefore, may require no external power<br>
source.<br>
Host PCB 410 includes an A/D converter 412 and a microprocessor 414. A/D<br>
converter 412 is operable to accept and digitize a signal from a pressure transducer.<br>
The signal may be filtered and protected from the influence of EMI/RFI interference.<br>
The operating characteristics of A/D converter 412, such as update rate and input<br>
selection, may be programmable through a serial interface. For example, A/D<br>
converter 412 may be adjusted via a serial interface from microprocessor 414, to<br>
accommodate varying output voltage levels from different types of pressure<br>
transducers, which may be excited from a constant voltage or constant current source.<br>
Microprocessor 414 may have a variety of functions. For example, the<br>
microprocessor may read the raw, digitized pressure signal from the A/D converter<br>
412 and also control A/D converter 412. Furthermore, microprocessor 414 may<br>
compensate the digitized signal to correct for non-linearity and temperature<br>
coefficients.<br>
Microprocessor 414 may also control power to A/D converter 412, along with<br>
most, if not all, of the other electronic instruments of a pressure measurement device.<br>
Thus, microprocessor 414 may conserve power by putting PCB assembly 400, or<br>
possibly even the entire pressure measurement device of which it is a part, to sleep or<br>
in a low power mode, waking the components at programmable time intervals.<br>
Microprocessor 414 may additionally control the frequency of wireless<br>
transmissions of pressure data based upon programmable pressure set points. For<br>
example, the device may transmit pressure data at a nominal frequency until such tune<br>
as the sensed pressure exceeds or falls below programmable warning pressure points.<br>
At that time, the transmission frequencies may increase or decrease in frequency,<br>
according to the program. If the sensed pressure exceeds or falls below these warning<br>
levels, then an alarm condition may be reached in which the transmission frequencies<br>
may again increase or decrease. When the sensed pressure returns to nominal levels,<br>
the transmission frequencies may return to their previous settings. Table 2 illustrates<br><br>
an example transmission frequency scheme. More generally, the processor output<br>
may include any appropriate type of pressure-related, data and/or any appropriate<br>
information about the pressure measurement device.<br><br>
Microprocessor 414 may also monitor and communicate over a serial IrDA<br>
link. Furthermore microprocessor 414 may "data-log" pressure data to an onboard<br>
memory, which may, for example, include random access memory (RAM),<br>
electronically-erasable, programmable read-only memory (EEPROM), compact disk<br>
read-only memory (CD-ROM), and/or any other appropriate volatile or non-volatile<br>
information storage device.<br>
Microprocessor 414 may further send pressure data to a digital display for<br>
local pressure indication. The pressure data may be sent in a serial fashion, and the<br>
display may operate in a low-power manner.<br>
Control of various aspects of assembly 400, and, hence, a pressure<br>
measurement device of which the assembly is a part, may be maintained and<br>
programmed through an IR Data Association (IrDA) interface 419. IrDA interface<br>
419 provides a two-way, serial communication link between microprocessor 414 and<br>
an external computer loaded with a software utility.<br>
The external computer, possibly connected through an RS-232 link to an IrDA<br>
converter, may use this software utility to perform multiple functions. These<br>
functions may include polling a pressure measurement device for information,<br>
changing the transmitting frequency based upon sensed pressure, and/or COM port<br>
selection. There may also be warning ranges and alarm ranges, each with their own<br><br>
programmable transmit intervals, as well as a nominal transmission frequency,<br>
established. Warning ranges and alarm ranges are one example of exception<br>
reporting. Additionally, the functions may be able to establish pressure check,<br>
transmit, and IrDA wake-up rates. Furthermore, the utility may be able to perform<br>
diagnostics of the components. The functions may be built on top of and/or in<br>
conjunction with the functionality available in IrDA interface 419.<br>
IrDA interface 419, possibly through the software utility, may also be used to<br>
control the scaling and calibration of the device of which assembly 400 is a part. For<br>
example, a full-scale pressure value may be entered, and with zero pressure<br>
introduced to the pressure sensor, a zero button on a utility screen is clicked. This<br>
action causes the readings to be normalized to zero, and microprocessor 414 to<br>
respond that the unit has been zeroed. The pressure sensor is then introduced to full-<br>
scale pressure, and a full-scale button on a utility screen is clicked. The full-scale<br>
values are displayed, and the microprocessor responds that the unit has been<br>
calibrated at full scale.<br>
A/D converter 412 may be set up through IrDA interface 419, as well.<br>
Through the interface, a user may program which inputs of the A/D converter are to<br>
be used, the internal gain required depending upon the sensor technology used, the<br>
conversion time of the converter, and/or other technical aspects of A/D converter<br>
operation. Furthermore, scaling factors for pressure data may be set, as well as<br>
engineering units for the pressure reading selected.<br>
Transmitter PCB 420 includes any appropriate components for wirelessly<br>
sending and/or receiving information. A suitable transmitter PCB may be obtained<br>
from AXONN Corp. of New Orleans, LA.<br>
FIG. 5 illustrates an example pressure measurement device 500. Device 500 is<br>
similar to device 10 in FIG. 1. Rather than using a piezosensor to generate an<br>
electrical output, however, device 500 uses motion-responsive current<br>
generating/sensing technology. An example of such is eddy current sensing. Suitable<br>
eddy current sensing structure is available from LZT Technology of San Bernadino,<br>
California.<br>
As illustrated, pressure measurement device 500 includes a Bourdon tube 504<br>
that is responsive to pressure changes at an inlet 502. An inductive target 506 is<br>
coupled to Bourdon tube 502, possibly through a movement, such that displacement<br>
of Bourdon tube 504 causes target 506 to translate proportionally to the pressure<br><br>
changes sensed at inlet 502. As shown, target 506 is a U-shaped, metallic stamping<br>
that is sized to wrap around the edge of a PCB 508. Target 506, however, may have<br>
any other appropriate configuration. PCB 508 is supported in a fixed position relative<br>
to the housing for the pressure measurement device by screws 510 and includes a pair<br>
of inductive coils 509, along with other traces. The motion of target 506 relative to<br>
the inductive coils affects the inductive balance in the circuit. Thus, pressure changes<br>
at inlet 502 are converted to an electrical output. Iα certain implementations, the<br>
output may be between 4-20 mA. As with device 10, the electrical output may then<br>
be processed and wirelessly transmitted to a remote location.<br>
Device 500 has a variety of features. For example, the device provides an<br>
efficient structure for converting pressure to electrical output that can be<br>
communicated to a remote location. Furthermore, the structure may be readily<br>
implemented in a standard pressure gauge, reducing manufacturing costs and possibly<br>
allow retrofitting. Furthermore, device 500 may be CE approved for EMI/RFI<br>
compatibility, and may be suitable for Class 1, Div 1 hazardous locations use (i.e.,<br>
intrinsically safe).<br>
FIGs. 6A-B illustrate an example pressure measurement device 600. As<br>
illustrated, pressure measurement device 600 is a digital pressure gauge. FIG. 6A<br>
shows a perspective view of pressure measurement device 600, and FIG. 6B shows a<br>
sectioned view of device 600.<br>
Device 600 includes a housing 610 that supports a pressure connection 620,<br>
which allows the pressure to be measured to be introduced to the device. Device 600<br>
also includes a PCB 630 that includes a processor 632 for processing a signal<br>
representing the pressure introduced at connection 620 and a transceiver 634 for<br>
generating a wireless transmission corresponding to the signal. That is, transceiver<br>
634 may generate a wireless transmission representing the pressure introduced at<br>
connection 620, along with other pressure-related data. PCB 630 may be similar to<br>
PCB assembly 400 in FIG. 4, and the signal may be formed by a piezosensor.<br>
Device 600 additionally includes a display 640 for presenting pressure-related<br>
data for the device. Display 600 may also present device status information (e.g.,<br>
on/off, transmitting/receiving, etc.). Display 640 may, for example, be a liquid<br>
crystal display (LCD).<br>
Device 600 further includes components that allow interaction with processor<br>
632. Located near display 640 are a plurality of function keys 650. Using function<br><br>
keys 650, a user may interrogate processor 632 for additional pressure-related data,<br>
such as pressure set points or exception reporting, device status, or any other<br>
appropriate information. In some implementations, a user may even program<br>
processor 632 using keys 650. Information regarding these interactions may be<br>
presented on display 640. Keys 650 may also be used to turn display on and off. This<br>
allows power to be conserved when a user is not observing device 600. In other<br>
implementations, keys 650 may be buttons, dials, a touchpad, or any other appropriate<br>
user input device. Device 600 may be safe for hazardous Class 1, Div. 1 locations,<br>
such as, for example, upstream gas well head applications.<br>
Device 600 also includes an electrical coupling 660, which may, for example,<br>
be a Heyco fitting. Through electrical coupling 660, processor 632 may accept<br>
discrete status input and/or output pulse accumulation information. For instance,<br>
discrete status inputs may be contact closure inputs that detect switch closures from<br>
an outside source, such as, for example, magnetic-type switch contact closures<br>
signaling the presence of a "Plunger Event" in a gas well head. As another example,<br>
the coupling and processor may count pulses received from an outside source, such<br>
as, for example, a gas meter. Additionally, other information may be input to<br>
processor 632 for wireless transmission by transceiver 634. For instance, information<br>
from another measurement device (e.g., a temperature measurement device such as a<br>
resistive temperature device or a thermocouple) may be input and transmitted. These<br>
measurements may also be intrinsically safe.<br>
Device 600 further includes a switch 670. Switch 670 controls the power<br>
status of transceiver 634. Thus, device 600 may be prevented from wirelessly<br>
transmitting information. Switch 670 may be useful when a user is programming<br>
processor 632 using function keys 650. In other implementations, switch 670 may be<br>
a button, a dial, or any other appropriate user input device.<br>
Note that switch 670 and function keys 650 allow the on/off functionality of<br>
the components that provide the local and wireless pressure data to be independently<br>
controlled. Thus, device 600 may provide pressure data locally, remotely, or locally<br>
and remotely. In other implementations, however, the independent control may be<br>
achieved through one input component or input component type.<br>
In particular implementations, device 600 may include less, more, and/or a<br>
different arrangement of components. For example, device 600 may include a<br>
dedicated visual indicator (e.g., an LED) and/or an audible indicator (e.g., a speaker)<br><br>
to present the status of the device. As another example, device 600 may include an<br>
IrDA interface for programming processor 632. As a further example, device 600<br>
may not include display 640, buttons 650, electrical coupling 660, and/or switch 670.<br>
Device 600 may be CE approved for EMI/RFI compatibility, and may be suitable for<br>
Class 1, Div 1 hazardous locations use (i.e., intrinsically safe).<br>
FIG. 7 illustrates a process 700 at a pressure measurement device. Process<br>
700 may be implemented by a pressure measurement device similar to pressure<br>
measurement device 10 in FIG. 1, pressure measurement device 100 in FIG. 3,<br>
pressure measurement device 500 in FIG. 5, pressure measurement device 600 in FIG.<br>
6, or any other appropriate pressure measurement device.<br>
The process begins with waiting to sense pressure at an inlet (decision block<br>
704). Once pressure is sensed, the process continues with converting the sensed<br>
pressure to an electrical signal (function block 708). The pressure may, for example,<br>
be converted to an electrical signal by a piezo-resistive device. The process also calls<br>
for converting the sensed pressure to a visual indication (function block 712). This<br>
conversion may, for example, be performed by: 1) a Bourdon tube with a rotatably<br>
coupled pointer; 2) determining a value of the electrical signal, associating a symbol<br>
with the value, and displaying the symbol; or 3) any other appropriate technique. The<br>
visual indication may be displayed at the pressure measurement device.<br>
The process continues with generating characterization data based on the<br>
electrical signal at function block 716. The characterization data may, for example,<br>
be generated by comparing an attribute of the signal to a table of signal attributes and<br>
determining a characteristic associated with that attribute. Table 1 provides such an<br>
example.<br>
The process continues with determining whether a change in pressure range<br>
has occurred (decision block 720). This determination may, for example, be made<br>
by comparing the magnitude of the signal to certain set points. The first column of<br>
Table 1 provides an example of pressure set points. If the pressure has changed<br>
ranges, the process calls for adjusting the pressure data transmission frequency<br>
(function block 724). For example, if the pressure has changed from a nominal level<br>
to one that is high, the transmission frequency may be adjusted from once every<br>
minute to once every ten seconds. Furthermore, if the pressure has reached a very<br>
high level, the transmission frequency may be adjust to once every second. Other<br>
pressure ranges and transmission frequencies may also be used.<br><br>
After adjusting the transmission frequency, or if there has been no change in<br>
pressure range, the process continues with determining whether it is time to transmit<br>
pressure data (decision block 728). The transmission time is determined in part by<br>
the transmission frequency. If it is not time to transmit, the process calls for<br>
returning to check for additional pressure sensings (decision block 704).<br>
If, however, it is time to transmit pressure data, the process calls for<br>
transmitting a wireless signal representing pressure data (function block 732). The<br>
wireless signal may be transmitted in the IR or other electromagnetic regime, and the<br>
data may be sent by pulse modulation or other appropriate technique. The data may<br>
include a representation of the magnitude of the electrical signal, the characterization<br>
data, the new transmission frequency, or any other appropriate pressure-related<br>
information.<br>
The process also calls for determining whether a transmission containing<br>
operational adjustments has been received at decision block 736. The adjustments<br>
may, for example, regard pressure set points, transmission frequencies, and/or any<br>
other appropriate operating parameter. If such a transmission has been received, the<br>
process calls for adjusting the operations at function block 740. Adjusting the<br>
operations may, for example, include altering instructions for a processor or data in a<br>
table. After adjusting operations, or if such a transmission has not been received, the<br>
process calls for returning to check for additional pressure sensings (decision block<br>
704).<br>
Although FIG. 7 illustrates a process at a pressure measurement device, other<br>
processes at a pressure measurement device may contain less, more, and/or a<br>
different arrangement of operations. For example, certain processes may not call for<br>
converting the sensed pressure to a visual indication, generating characterization<br>
data, adjusting the transmission frequency, and/or receiving an operational<br>
adjustment transmission. As another example, a process may call for storing<br>
pressure data until it is time to transmit. As a further example, generating<br>
characterization data may occur at any point after the formation of the electrical<br>
signal but before the transmission of the wireless signal, As an additional example,<br>
determining whether an operational adjustment transmission has been received may<br>
be accomplished at any point. As another example, a process may call for providing<br>
a visual indication of operating mode. This may, for example, be accomplished<br>
using an LED indicator having two LEDs, where one LED indicates on/off and the<br><br>
other indicates transmitting/receiving. As a further example, a process may call for<br>
entering into a power conservation mode. As an additional example, a process may<br>
include receiving externally generated data and transmitting the data as part of the<br>
wireless signal.<br>
FIG. 8 illustrates components 800 for an example pressure measurement<br>
device. Components 800 include a pressure transducer 810, a processor 820, and a<br>
transceiver 830. Pressure transducer 810 is operable to sense pressure and to<br>
generate an electrical signal representative of the pressure. Pressure transducer 810<br>
may, for example, be a piezosensor. Processor 820 is operable to receive the signal,<br>
analyze it, and generate a signal representative of the pressure transducer signal.<br>
Processor 820 may, for example, accomplish this by determining a set of pulses that<br>
represent the pressure transducer signal. Processor 820 may also determine other<br>
pressure-related data, such as exception reports. For performing its operations,<br>
processor 820 may have instructions encoded therein and/or stored in memory<br>
associated therewith. Transceiver 830 is responsible for wireless transmitting the<br>
processor signal. The transmission may represent the pressure sensed by the pressure<br>
transducer, as well as other pressure-related data.<br>
Components 800 also include user interface devices — a user output device<br>
840 and a user input device 850. User output device 840 is operable to present<br>
information, whether about pressure, the device, or otherwise, to a user at the<br>
pressure measurement device. The information may be presented in visual, audible,<br>
tactile, or other appropriate format. User input device 850 is operable to detect<br>
commands from a user at the device. User input device 850 could include a button, a<br>
keypad, a touch screen, a stylus, a microphone, and/or any other appropriate device.<br>
Processor 820 is typically responsible for responding to the commands.<br>
Although FIG. 8 illustrates the components for a pressure measurement<br>
device, other pressure measurement devices may include less, more, and/or a<br>
different arrangement of components. For example, a pressure measurement device<br>
may not include a user input device and/or a user output device. As another<br>
example, a pressure measurement device may include an A/D converter between<br>
pressure transducer 810 and processor 820 and/or a memory coupled to processor<br>
820.<br><br>
FIG. 9 illustrates a system 900 for programming a pressure measurement<br>
device. To program a pressure measurement device, system 900 uses IR signals.<br>
System 900 may be especially useful for programming a pressure gauge.<br>
System 900 includes an IrDA adapter 910 and a holder 920 for the adapter.<br>
Adapter 910 and holder 920 include apertures, IR-transmissive windows, and/or<br>
other constructs through which IR signals may be emitted. Holder 920 also includes<br>
an aperture 922 through which an LED status light of adapter 910 may shine when<br>
transmitting, in order that the status of the adapter may be determined by a user.<br>
Adapter 920 may be any appropriate IrDA adapter and, in particular embodiments,<br>
may be an IrDA serial COM port manufactured by ActiSys of California. Holder<br>
920 may, for example, be molded of a suitable plastic, such as, for example,<br>
polycarbonate.<br>
System 900 also includes a vacuum cup 930 assembly with integral stud/nut<br>
mounting. Assembly 930 may be of a type offered by Adams Manufacturing of<br>
Pennsylvania.<br>
In operation, a user assembles holder 920 with vacuum cup assembly 930 and<br>
inserts adapter 910 into holder 920. Holder 920 may include a device for capturing<br>
adapter 910. The capturing device may, for example, be a piece of Velcro tape within<br>
the opening to further secure item adapter 910 when it is inserted fully into holder<br>
920. The user positions the transmission construct of holder 920 near the receiving<br>
construct of the pressure measurement device. In particular implementations, the<br>
receiving construct may be a pass-through hole in a dial plate, and the positioning is<br>
accomplished by pressing assembly 930 to the housing window, which may be a<br>
transparent window that is standard issue on pressure gauges. Assembly 930 may be<br>
coupled to the housing on a temporary basis (e.g., for as long as it takes to configure<br>
the transmitter), as the user would normally break the vacuum grip of assembly 930<br>
and store the assembly for future reuse.<br>
Once in place, IR pulses are emitted through the transmissive constructs of<br>
adapter 910 and assembly 920 to the receptive construct of the housing. The signals,<br>
possibly after passing through in-line holes in the housing mid-partition, reach the<br>
IrDA transceiver, which may be located on the front side of host PCB 60 in FIG 2.<br>
The pressure measurement devices discussed may be particularly useful for a<br>
variety of different applications. For example, they may be useful in well heads. As<br><br>
another example, they may be useful in hazardous environments or places that are<br>
difficult to access.<br>
While particular implementations and applications have been illustrated and<br>
described, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the precise<br>
construction and compositions disclosed herein and that various additions, deletions,<br>
substitutions, and/or modifications may be apparent from the foregoing descriptions<br>
without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the<br>
appended claims.<br><br>
