				<td>WIND TURBINE SYSTEM<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to improved vertical-axis wind turbines with<br>
enhanced conversion of wind kinetic energy into mechanical energy. Vertical-axis<br>
turbines are typically of a long axis type, allowing large columns of air to be<br>
harnessed. These devices differ from horizontal-axis (propeller) type windmills<br>
which typically pivot about a vertical axis in order that they may face directly into a<br>
wind. The improvement of the invention comprises the use of lightweight materials<br>
for the construction of the components of the wind turbine. Lightweight materials<br>
such as non-metallic composite sandwich panels are preferred. The vertical-axis<br>
turbines of this invention are designed to be employed as a cost effective alternate<br>
power source in any wind condition.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Wind as a source of energy is a concept that has been promoted for some time.<br>
According to one source, there is evidence which shows that windmills were in use in<br>
Babylon and in China as early as 2000 B.C. The United States Patent and Trademark<br>
Office has granted patents on windmill devices dating back to the early to mid 1800's.<br>
Despite the continued research and development in this age old technology, until the<br>
present invention, no windmill or wind turbine device has successfully appropriately<br>
addressed some of the most important problems which have seemingly made the<br>
harnessing of wind not economically feasible. While wind is unquestionably a large<br>
potential source of energy, estimated to be about 5 kW per acre in the United States,<br>
its variability in velocity has made it an unreliable source. Many devices such as U.S.<br>
Patent Nos. 4850792 to Yeoman, 4035658 to Diggs and 2406268 to Terhune have<br>
relied on the ability of concentrating low to moderate winds for producing power.<br>
Others, like those shown in U.S. Patent Nos. 4834610 to Bond and 4075500 to Oman,<br>
et al. (a horizontal-axis turbine), have accomplished the harnessing variable wind<br>
speeds by using modern variable speed governors. No device currently known to the<br>
present inventors is capable of adequately harnessing low and high-winds for power<br>
production. High winds are characterized, for purposes of discussion as currents<br>
having average velocities above 45 m.p.h., or having gusts greater than 60 m.p.h.<br>
Many devices are designed to fold and/or feather in winds reaching certain levels.<br>
Such devices are illustrated in U.S. Patent is Nos. 4818181 to Kodric, 4632637 to<br>
Traudt, and 3942909 to Yengst. These techniques, while intended to protect the<br>
structural integrity of the windmill, decrease a device's ability to produce power.<br>
Others, such as Patent No. 5,391,926 to Staley and Elder, attempt to harness high<br>
winds emanating from any direction for power production but low to moderate winds<br>
have been unable to produce adequate torque for continual reliable power generation.<br>
Until the present invention variable winds have been an untapped source of energy by<br>
those skilled in the relevant art.<br>
In the past, wind driven power generators of all sorts have attempted to<br>
harness the energy present in the wind. Some have concentrated their efforts in the<br>
low to moderate wind range and suffer periodic damage from the occasional high<br>
wind while others work well in the moderate to high wind range with little or no<br>
success in harnessing low speed wind. No prior art has effectively drawn useable<br>
power from the slight breeze all the way to gale force winds. Perhaps one of the<br>
biggest reasons for the lack of all wind turbines has to do with the structural integrity<br>
of typical wind devices. By design many are lightweight, inadequately supported, and<br>
made from insufficient materials. A number of these devices are comprised of a<br>
multitude of moving parts, such as rotors, stators, vanes, shields, and the like. These<br>
parts not only compromise the integrity of the machine, but also require continuous<br>
maintenance, repair and/or replacement. For such a device, which may produce only<br>
a few kilowatts of power, the costs soon begin to outweigh the benefits. Another<br>
concept widely used is to build large multi-story wind turbines capable of producing<br>
at or near the megawatt level. Two such devices are shown in U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
3902072 to Quinn, and 3994621 to Bogie. It is believed that these devices would cost<br>
close to $100 million to build and several hundred thousand to maintain each year.<br>
Another example is the 1.25 MW generator installed near Rutland, Vermont. This is<br>
believed to be the largest windmill ever built in the United States, having two main<br>
blades each 175 feet in diameter. This facility operated intermittently between 1941<br>
and 1945, during the war years when most resources were being used for war efforts.<br>
In 1945 one of the blades broke due to material fatigue and was never repaired,<br>
presumably due to a lack of cost efficiency. Similar to the smaller units, these large<br>
devices become cost prohibitive on a much larger scale. The present invention solves<br>
this second problem by presenting a low cost, low maintenance, cost efficient wind<br>
turbine. While certain aspects of the design have been known, until the present<br>
invention the proper combination of elements, new and old, has not been achieved to<br>
provide a commercially viable product.<br>
Variable wind velocity is not, of course, the only obstacle in harnessing kinetic<br>
energy from the wind. Wind direction has been another area of study and<br>
development. Wind currents are typically unpredictable, and due to topography,<br>
upper air disturbances, changing weather patterns, or seasonal variations, they rarely<br>
blow in the same direction for any substantial length of time. For this reason effective<br>
wind machines must be capable of immediately accommodating winds from a full 360<br>
degrees. Some devices have attempted to accomplish this goal with pivoting shields,<br>
and stators or wind directing vanes. U.S. Patent Nos. 4474529 to Kinsey, 537494 to<br>
Stevens et al., the Yengst patent, and many other devices illustrate such an approach.<br>
As mentioned previously, additional moving parts usually detract from a machine's<br>
cost effectiveness. While not in the field of the present invention horizontal-axis<br>
machines typically pivot the entire rotor assembly so that it may face upwind. Still<br>
other designs leave the rotor assembly open (that is, no wind directing vanes or stators<br>
are utilized) so that winds from any horizontal direction may impart rotation upon the<br>
rotor assembly. This leaves the rotor completely open to the harshness and<br>
destructive abilities of the wind. Once again the present invention solves this problem<br>
by providing 360 degrees of wind reception, in all types of wind conditions.<br>
One important application of a wind turbine able to respond to wind from all<br>
directions and of variable velocity is as a power generator on top of tall buildings.<br>
One reason for this is that wind velocity typically increases with altitude above the<br>
ground. For example, the wind velocity at the top of a 36 story building is on average<br>
18 mph faster than on the ground, and is typically 45 mph faster at the top of a 70<br>
story building. As another example, the wind velocity at the top of the Sears Tower in<br>
Chicago, Illinois, averages 70 mph. This wind at the tops of tall buildings is clearly a<br>
potential power source. A wind turbine large enough to be economically useful on<br>
top of a tall building would measure about 20 feet tall by 20 feet wide. A wind<br>
turbine of this size built out of traditional materials such as 1/2 inch thick steel plates<br>
would weigh about 28,000 pounds, and additional bracing required to hold the turbine<br>
in place would weigh as much as 60,000 pounds. A problem with a turbine of this<br>
size is that it would unresponsive to light wind as it would require a wind velocity of<br>
at least 18 mph before it would begin to turn. There is also a gyroscopic effect<br>
associated with the turbine as it begins to rotate that increases with increasing<br>
rotational speed that would cause additional stress to the building in response to the<br>
torque on the turbine. In addition, traditional materials such as steel, due to its<br>
thermal conductivity, would begin to form ice on the turbine blades, which would<br>
negatively impact the smooth flow of wind through the turbine.<br>
The present invention, in its various embodiments, recognizes and addresses<br>
these and other problems and overcomes many limitations encountered by those<br>
skilled in the art. Many devices and procedures have taught the use of folding or<br>
feathering in high wind conditions, and thus have been unable to realize the potential<br>
power of high winds. Others, such as the Staley and Elder patent have attempted to<br>
address the damaging characteristics of high winds by stressing structural integrity<br>
and durability to the point of sacrificing the ability to produce adequate torque in the<br>
low to moderate wind speed range. It is not economically feasible to build a wind<br>
turbine that can only produce mechanical power during periods of high wind. The<br>
entire range of wind conditions must be fully utilized for a wind turbine to be<br>
commercially viable. Problems such as high cost and high maintenance of most wind<br>
energy facilities exist in the field, but such problems have not been adequately<br>
addressed by those skilled in the art. While high velocity wind is a well known<br>
natural occurrence with high kinetic energy, its value in the field of vertical-axis wind<br>
turbines has not only been ignored to some extent, it has often been looked upon as a<br>
detriment. The prior art has taught away from the present invention by stressing rotor<br>
attachment and stator curvature. Rather than supplying a system which affords only<br>
an incremental increase in performance over the prior art, the present invention<br>
utilizes techniques which were not previously considered in order to achieve what<br>
may perhaps be leaps in performance compared to the prior art. Further, the present<br>
invention has achieved a more full utilization of a previously untapped precious<br>
natural resource, the wind.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention discloses an improved wind turbine which provides<br>
enhanced conversion of wind kinetic energy into mechanical energy and which<br>
operates in all wind conditions, such as velocities up to 130 mph, and frequently<br>
changing wind directions. The improvement comprises- the use of light weight<br>
modern building materials such as lightweight composite laminates to the reduce<br>
weight of the weight turbine and the improved thermal properties of such materials<br>
decrease the tendency of turbine blades to form ice. Non-metallic materials such as<br>
fiberglass or carbon fiber composite materials are as strong as steel but with only a<br>
fraction of the weight. The preferred materials are honeycomb sandwich panels that<br>
typically feature a honeycomb core manufactured from an aramid fiber with various<br>
non-metallic face layers, such as epoxy, fiberglass, phenols, and kevlar.<br>
Alternatively, lightweight metals such as aluminum can be used in the construction of<br>
the honeycomb core. The face layers can be laminated.<br>
The wind turbine also provides a reliable and effective means for directing air<br>
currents into and out of the rotor cage assembly. Rather than supplying a system<br>
which affords only an incremental increase in performance and design over the prior<br>
art, the present invention utilizes combinations and techniques which were not<br>
previously considered to achieve an increase in performance unparalleled by the prior<br>
art. This invention serves to operate with a minimum number of movable parts and<br>
systems, to optimize potential power production by allowing energy from high winds<br>
to be harnessed as well as low and moderate winds, and to optimize air current intake<br>
and exhaust by providing immediate accommodations to winds from any given<br>
direction.<br>
In general terms, the invention involves various embodiments of a vertical-<br>
axis wind turbine. Many of the elements of this device achieve several different<br>
objectives which, when combined, act to achieve the mentioned increases in<br>
performance. In the preferred embodiment, the invention discloses stationary stators<br>
for more effectively directing currents into the rotor cage assembly to impart a higher<br>
rotational velocity and greater torque upon the turbine shaft through some torque<br>
generating elements such as the rotor blades. In addition, the stationary stators<br>
provide a structural integrity necessary for operation during high wind conditions.<br>
This aspect also prevents the disruption of rotation by shielding the totors from winds<br>
counter-directional to their rotation which may occur as the wind shifts. The present<br>
wind turbines comprise stator blades which are straight and wherein the stator blades<br>
are offset b optimal offset angle so that there is a minimal effect on the loss of wind<br>
kinetic energy.<br>
Importantly, the invention breaks from several time honored traditions in<br>
harnessing wind. By recognizing and utilizing the potential energy of all winds, and<br>
by designing an apparatus with resistance to the destructiveness of these winds during<br>
standard operation the present invention achieves its goals.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an omni-wind, vertical-axis<br>
turbine which can be employed in many different environments including on the tops<br>
of tall buildings. The stated invention acts to convert wind currents into mechanical<br>
energy which energy may then be transferred from a turbine or the like to be used to<br>
directly act upon a water pump, or to drive an electrical generator (or more<br>
generically an energy-utilizing device) for use as an alternate power source. The<br>
turbine may be equipped with any number of rotors and stators which interact with the<br>
variable wind currents during operation. In addition, a minimum number of moving parts is used to<br>
increase reliability, to decrease maintenance, and to decrease production costs.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a wind turbine design and construction<br>
which is capable of operation with enhanced efficiency in a variety of wind conditions. Such<br>
conditions include, but are not limited to. winds from any direction which bossess a horizontal<br>
component, even where such wind direction is capable of frequent changes, winds reaching velocities<br>
of 130 m.p.h. or more, and winds with continuously changing velocities. It is an object that the<br>
present invention be capable of standard operation during these conditions without any need for<br>
employing folding and feathering techniques, or a speed control or braking system.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide an improved design which is capable of<br>
immediately accomodating winds from any direction having a horizontal component, as stated<br>
earlier. It is an object that this immediate readiness of the present invention be achievable with no<br>
moving parts.<br>
It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a design which utilizes a<br>
minimum of moving parts for improved reliability. It is an object that necessary maintenance and<br>
replacement of any parts should be minimized, and the durability of the entire apparatus be vastly<br>
improved. Furthermore, an object of this invention is to provide an improved wind turbine which can<br>
be used in various environments including tall buildings and which the turbine elements which resist<br>
icings.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The following descriptions and referenced drawings are for selected preferred<br>
embodiments of the present invention. Naturally, changes may be made to the<br>
disclosed embodiments while still falling within the scope and spirit of the present<br>
invention and the patent granted to its inventor.<br>
The improvement of the invention comprises the use of lightweight materials<br>
which allow the enhanced conversion of wind kinetic energy into mechanical energy<br>
in the construction the components of a wind turbine. Such a construction is<br>
particularly important for embodiments intended for use on top of buildings. Non-<br>
metallic materials such as fiberglass or carbon fiber composite materials are as strong<br>
as steel but with only a fraction of the weight. The preferred materials are honeycomb<br>
sandwich panels such as, for example, those manufactured by the Euro-Composites®<br>
Group, depicted in Figures 8A and 8B. These panels typically feature a honeycomb<br>
core manufactured from an aramid fiber with various non-metallic face layers, such as<br>
epoxy, fiberglass, phenols, and kevlar. As can be seen from the figures, the cells of<br>
the honeycomb core extend perpendicular to the face layers of the panels. One type<br>
of honeycomb core features a hexagonal cell, depicted as (20) in Figure 8A, while<br>
Figure 8B depicts another type of honeycomb core utilizing a rectangular cell (21).<br>
The face layers (22) are typically laminated. Details about these materials can be<br>
found at the Euro-Composites® Group web site, euro-composites.com, the contents of<br>
which are incorporated herein by reference. Non-metallic carbon-fibers are the<br>
preferred construction materials, but as an alternative, a lightweight metal such as<br>
aluminum can be used in the manufacture of the honeycomb core.<br>
As discussed above, a 20 foot by 20 foot turbine manufactured with 1/2 inch<br>
steel panels would weigh about 28,000 pounds, and would need additional bracing.<br>
An equivalent sized turbine manufactured from 3/4 to 7/8 inch thick carbon fiber<br>
laminate panels would weigh only about 1,000 pounds, and would need no additional<br>
bracing. A turbine this light would be able to begin rotating in a wind velocity of only<br>
5 mph, as apposed to the 18 mph required for the steel embodiment, and can rotate at<br>
a much higher angular velocity than the steel embodiment. A turbine having<br>
components made from the honeycomb sandwich panels can produce power in both<br>
lighter breezes and heavier winds than the steel embodiment. The light weight of the<br>
honeycomb sandwich panel turbine also reduces the additional stress placed on a<br>
building by the gyroscopic effects of the rotating turbine. In addition, the honeycomb<br>
sandwich panel turbine embodiment is more efficient than the steel turbine<br>
embodiment. For example, tests performed on a turbine that is 2 foot high by 4 feet in<br>
diameter indicate that a steel turbine operates at an efficiency of about 20.3%, that is,<br>
it converts about 20.3% of the wind kinetic energy into usable energy, such as<br>
electrical power. A fiberglass turbine of the same size operates at about 25.1%<br>
efficiency, and a turbine manufactured using honeycomb sandwich panels produced<br>
by the Euro-Composites® Group operate at about 32.3% efficiency. Unlike steel<br>
turbines, turbines manufactured from honeycomb sandwich panels become more<br>
efficient as the size of the turbine is increased, and efficiencies of up to 45% are<br>
possible. The honeycomb sandwich panel materials also have a much lower<br>
coefficient of thermal conductivity than metals such as steel, and thus will not form<br>
ice under normal operating conditions.<br>
As can be seen from the drawings, the basic concepts of the present invention<br>
may be embodied in many different ways. Figure 1 and 1A show the preferred<br>
embodiment of the wind turbine (8) having a shaft (1) that is turned by rotor blades<br>
(2) that are attached to a top rotor cage plate (3) and bottom rotor cage plate (4) then<br>
drive an energy-transfer element (11) and an energy-utilizing device (12) (both shown<br>
as contained within or at the base). Each of these elements. The height of these rotor<br>
blades in one of the preferred embodiments is 4 feet 8 inches but will vary<br>
proportionally with the size of the unit built. In another preferred embodiment,<br>
intended for use on top of tall buildings, the rotor blades are at least 20 feet high by 20<br>
feet in diameter. Furthermore, in accordance with preferred embodiments of the<br>
present invention, from 2 to 5 blade elements may be used. Wind is compressed and<br>
directed to the rotor blades (2) by numerous stator blades (5) which can also be<br>
constructed of light weight materials such as those described above. Wind with a<br>
downward diagonal thrust can be accommodated by the rotor blades (2) through use<br>
of an open stator cage cover (10) that renders the turbine (8) at least partially topless<br>
and increases efficiency by up to an estimated 20% over any prior art. Wind<br>
attempting to enter the turbine (8) against the prevailing wind direction and hence<br>
against the direction of the rotors is deflected by top shield (6). Top shield (6) has a<br>
central pivoting point and an outer terminus and moves about the open top of turbine<br>
(8) by use of a center bearing (10A) side bearings (10B) and bearing race (10C). The<br>
movement of the top shield (6) to a downwind position is aided by the top shield vane<br>
(7). Figure 1B depicts a second embodiment of the present invention wherein top<br>
shield (6) is not provided with a vane. The top shield (6) creates an area on the<br>
downwind side of the turbine (8) that is of low turbidity and increases the invention's<br>
ability to exhaust wind passing through the machine. The top shield (6) does not at<br>
any time hinder the accommodation of productive winds from any direction.<br>
Wherever feasible, the described elements are made using light materials as<br>
hereinbefore described.<br>
Figure 2 and 2A show the rotor cage (1). Total rigidity and structural integrity<br>
may be enhanced by the top rotor cage plate (3) and the bottom rotor cage plate (4).<br>
Please note that the top plate (3) may be arced slightly to better compress and<br>
direct air or other fluid into the rotor cage. A reverse angle on the bottom rotor cage<br>
plate (4) may accomplish the same task but with an upward thrust.<br>
Only the top and bottom rotor cage plates may be attached to the shaft. This<br>
unique aspect can aid in the invention's ability to readily accept, utilize and exhaust<br>
wind or other fluid. Structural integrity and rigidity may be enhanced by the rotor<br>
blades being attached in two places rather than directly to the shaft as in previous art.<br>
Figure 3 shows the layout of the rotor blades (1) with respect to each other as<br>
well as to the shaft (2). Special note should be taken of the space (3) between the<br>
shaft (2) and the inside edge of the rotor blades (1). This space is a substantial<br>
component of one embodiment of the invention in a number of ways. First, by<br>
allowing some of the air to flow through the center of the machine, the air impacts the<br>
blade on the downwind side of the invention adding to thrust and aiding in the exhaust<br>
cycle. The space between the shaft and rotor can also achieve greater torque by<br>
pushing the kinetic energy of the wind to be exerted further away from the center<br>
point (i.e., the shaft). The flat surfaces of the rotor blades allow wind to impart its<br>
force and be immediately deflected. A curved or cupped surface (as described in<br>
previous art) may allow air to collect in the curvature and cushion the force of<br>
subsequent winds. The layout of the rotor cage in the preferred embodiment is shown<br>
but it must be mentioned that changes may be made to the layout without departing<br>
from the broad aspect of the present invention.<br>
The deflected air from the rotor blades is also able to find its way through the<br>
space between the shaft and the rotor blades to aid in the invention's ability to<br>
exhaust. The space between the rotor blades and the shaft in the preferred<br>
embodiment vary proportionately with the size of the unit built.<br>
In Figure 4, 4A and 4B, the stator blades (5) are arranged around the<br>
circumference of the rotor cage in equidistant pairs. In the preferred embodiment 8<br>
blades are shown but more or fewer blades could be used without substantially<br>
departing from the broad aspect of the present invention. Unlike previous art, which<br>
had curved stator blades it has been found that straight stators that are offset from the<br>
center point allows air to enter the turbine with less turbidity and thus more force.<br>
When an attempt is made to bend or change the direction of air currents (as previous<br>
art has done with curved stator blades), the force of the wind may be greatly<br>
diminished. Straight stators, while directing air into the invention, can have, a<br>
minimal effect on the loss of kinetic energy. Stator blade offset angles of from 30° to<br>
60° by increments of 1° have been tested, and it has been found that the optimal angle<br>
of offset from the center point for the stator blades is 45°. Changing this angle by as<br>
much as 1° can seriously degrade the performance of the turbine. For example, tests<br>
have shown that in a 40 mph wind, angling the stator blades at 44° will produce 200<br>
kW less power over a 24 hour period than stator blades angled at 45°. The wind<br>
turbine has been designed to accept all available winds regardless of their speed and<br>
thus has no need for a stator design that would dampen or lessen the force of the wind.<br>
Figure 5 depicts the alignment of the stator cage cover. This is the part of the<br>
invention that allows the turbine to be virtually topless with regard to incoming<br>
currents of air. Once properly attached to the stator blades, the turbine is structurally<br>
sound and is ready to withstand, with regard to wind turbine embodiments, winds in<br>
excess of 100 m.p.h. Air currents approaching the rotor cage that have a slightly<br>
downward thrust pass through the open top (between the bearing races) and impact<br>
the rotor blades creating rotation. Previous art was able to accommodate wind<br>
currents that moved horizontally only, and thus, were able to accommodate only a<br>
portion of the wind that can be handled by the new invention.<br>
The stator cage cover may be constructed concentric braces to ensure<br>
structural stability. On the top side of the concentric braces are bearing races to<br>
accommodate the top shield bearings.<br>
Figures 6 and 7 show the top shield and top shield vane. The vane can be<br>
designed to create enough drag to rotate the top shield to a downwind position.<br>
Figure 1B depicts a second, alternative embodiment wherein the vane technique is not<br>
incorporated.<br>
Once the shield is in proper position, wind with a downward thrust is also<br>
allowed to enter the wind turbine. (Modeling done to date shows that the open top<br>
embodiment increases performance by up to about 20%.) The top shield prevents<br>
conflicting winds from entering the invention from the downwind side that would<br>
interfere with rotation or exhausting. The space between the top shield and the rotor<br>
cage can create a space of calm air that may improve the invention's exhausting<br>
characteristics and that has a dampening feature. The front side or upwind or<br>
upcurrent side of the top shield is slightly convex on the horizontal! plane and may<br>
prevent the top shield from buffeting during periods of high winds. The center<br>
bearing (10A) of the top shield (6) can allow the mechanism to pivot easily while<br>
wheels or bearings (10B) resting on the concentric bearing races (10C) may carry the<br>
weight of the top shield. The wind vane or tail of the top shield (7) can aid in the top<br>
shield's ability to move into a position opposing the wind and may enhance the<br>
shield's stability during operation.<br>
In addition, the overall weight of the components can be an integral part of the<br>
invention. While mass (i.e., weight) can be used to dampen or deaden vibration, the<br>
new invention operates so smoothly that the lightweight carbon fiber materials used in<br>
its construction will not jeopardize structural integrity and will allow the turbine to be<br>
placed atop existing buildings or in environmentally sensitive areas or areas where<br>
large erection equipment would have no access.<br>
As can be easily understood from the foregoing, the basic concepts of the<br>
present invention may be embodied in a variety of ways. It involves the use of light<br>
weight materials in the construction of wind turbines and both the enhanced<br>
harnessing of kinetic energy techniques resulting from the use of light weight<br>
construction material as well as devices to accomplish the appropriate harnessing of<br>
energy. In this application, the harnessing techniques are disclosed as part of the<br>
