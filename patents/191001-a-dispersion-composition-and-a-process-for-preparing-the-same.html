The presence of one or more -SO2F groups in a dye molecule generally improves the properties of that dye and confers surprisingly good wet-fastness and light-fastness properties.<br>
The invention also relates to a process for the preparation of dispersion composition, comprising mixing homogeneously<br>
i)	a dye compound of formula (1) in an amount of from 1 to 30% by<br>
weight of the composition , ii)        a dispersing agent in an amount of 10 to 200% by weight of the dye<br>
compound and<br>
iii) conventional components such as wetting agents and defoamers in an aqueous medium in a manner such as herein described, to obtain a dispersion composition in the form of homogenous mixture.<br>
The dispersion composition is neither a product of chemical reaction nor a mere admixture resulting in the aggregation of the properties of the individual components but is in fact a synergistic composition having improved and unexpected properties in that the respective components of the dispersion cooperate together so as to provide, in application thereof to a textile fabric, a dyed product having surprisingly good fastness to washing, light and heat.<br>
Different dye compounds of Formula (1) may be mixed or the dye compounds of Formula (1) may be mixed with dyes which do not contain an -SO2F group, such mixtures are a feature of the present invention. The mixtures may be simple physical mixtures or may be mixed crystals formed for example by co-crystallisation. Such mixtures generally show improvement in dyeing properties.<br>
Crystalline modifications of the dye compounds of Formula (1) exist and it is intended that the present definition<br>
conventionally used in carrying out such processes.  The process conditions may be selected from the following: i)   exhaust dyeing at a pH of from 4 to 6.5, at a<br>
temperature of from 125°C to 140°C for from 10 to 120 minutes and under a pressure of from 1 to 2 bar; a sequestrant may optionally be added; ii)  continuous dyeing at a pH of from 4 to 6.5, at a temperature of from 190°C to 225°C for from 15 seconds to 5 minutes;'  a migration inhibitor may optionally be added; iii) printing direct at a pH of from 4 to 6.5, at a temperature of from 160°C to 185°C for 4 to 15 minutes for high temperature steaming, or at a temperature of from 190°C to 225°C for 15 seconds to 5 minutes for bake fixation with dry heat or at a temperature of from 120°C to 140°C and 1 to 2 bar for 10 to 45 minutes for pressure steaming;  wetting agents and thickeners (such as alginates) of from 5 to 100% by weight of the dye may optionally be added; iv)  discharge printing (by padding the dye onto the<br>
textile material, drying and overprinting) at a pH of from 4 to 6.5;  migration inhibitors and thickeners may optionally be added; v)   carrier dyeing at a pH of from 4 to 6.5, at a<br>
temperature of from 95°C to 100°C using a carrier such as methylnaphthalene, diphenylamine or 2-phenylphenol;  sequesterants may optionally be added;  and vi)  atmospheric dyeing of acetate, triacetate and nylon at a pH of from 4 to 6.5, at a temperature of 85°C for acetate or at a temperature of 90°C for<br>
triacetate and nylon for from 15 to 90 minutes;<br>
sequesterants may optionally be added.<br>
In all the above processes the dye compound of Formula (1) is applied as a dispersion comprising from 0.001% to 4% of the compound in aqueous medium.<br>
The present compounds generally provide coloured textile material which shows good fastness to washing, light and heat.<br>
The dye compounds of Formula (1) preferably carry a total of from one to three -SO2F groups, more preferably from one to two -SO2F groups and especially one -S02F group.<br>

R4, R5, R6, R11, R12, R13, R14 and R15 are as hereinbefore<br>
defined for compounds of Formula (2);  and R16 is    -H, -CN, -S02F, -COOC1-6-alkyl, -COC1-6-alkyl or<br>

In compounds of Formula (3) R  is preferably -H, -CN, -COOC1-6-alkyl, -COC1-6-alkyl or -CONR1R2 and R17 is preferably -H, -CN or C1-6-alkyl.<br>
A further subgroup of dye compounds of Formula (11 is that of dye compounds of Formula (4):<br>

in which R3 to Ri5 are as hereinbefore defined, except for 4-(2'-methoxyphenylazo-4'-(4'-fluorosulphonylphenylazo)) phenol, which may alternatively be named as l-(4'-hydroxyphenylazo)-2-methoxy-4-(4'-fluorosulphonylphenylazo)benzene.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment of the present invention the dye compounds of Formulae (1), (2), (3) and (4) carry directly at least one -SO2F group or carry a substituent to which at least one -SO2F group is attached and carry at least one ester group or carry a substituent to which at least one ester group is attached.  Such dyes with both -SO2F and ester groups show improved dyeing properties, particularly wet-fastness and light-fastness.<br>
Compositions in accordance with the invention comprising dispersions of the dye compounds of Formulae {1} ,    (2), (3) and (4) in which A, D and E are as hereinbefore defined in aqueous media are novel.  The compositions typically comprise from 1% to 30% of a<br>
compound of Formula (1), (2) or (3) and are preferably buffered at a pH from 2 to 7, more preferably at a pH from 4 to 6.<br>
These dispersions may further comprise ingredients conventionally used in dyeing applications such as dispersing agents for example lignosulphonates, naphthalene sulphonic acid/formaldehyde condensates or phenol/cresol/sulphanilic acid/formaldehyde condensates, surfactants, wetting agents such as alkyl aryl ethoxylates which may be sulphonated or phosphated, inorganic salts, de-foamers such as mineral oil or nonanol, organic liquids and buffers.  Dispersing agents may be present at from 10% to 200% on the weight of the dye compound of Formula (1).  Wetting agents may be used at from 0% to 20% on the weight of the dye compound of Formula (1).  The dispersions may be prepared by bead milling the dye compound of Formula (1) with glass beads or sand in an aqueous medium.<br>
A number of compounds of Formula (1) used in the" above coloration process are novel except for I-(4-hydroxyphenylazo)-2-methoxy-4-(4-fluorosulphonylphenylazo)benzene;<br>
1-(2-chloro-4-nitrophenylazo)-5-methyl-2-fluorosulphonyl-4-(2-hydroxy-3-(carbonyl(n-phenyl)amino)naphth-1-ylazo)benzene;<br>
1-(2-methyl-5-fluorosulphonylphenylazo)-3-ethoxy-4-(2-hydroxy-3-(carbonyl(N-phenyl)amino)naphth-1-ylazo)benzene;<br>
1-(3-fluorosulphonylphenylazo)-2,5-dimethoxy-4-(2-hydroxy-3-(carbonyl(N-naphth-1-yl)amino)naphth-1-ylazo)benzene;  and<br><br>
1-(2-methyl-5-fluorosulphonylphenylazo)-4-(2-hydroxy—3-(carbonyl(N-phenyl)amino)naphth-1-ylazo)naphthalene.<br>
The dye compounds of Formula (1) may be prepared by usual methods for the preparation of disazo compounds such as by diazotisation of an amine A-NH2 and coupling onto a component X-D-NH2 in which A and D are as hereinbefore defined and X is a group displaceable by a diazotised amine, followed by diazotisation of the resultant monoazo compound A-N=N-D-NH2 and coupling onto a component E-X in which E and X are as hereinbefore defined.<br>
Typically the amine A-NH2 may be diazotised in an acidic medium such as acetic or propionic acid or mixtures thereof using a nitrosating agent such as nitrosyl sulphuric acid at a temperature from -5°C to 5°C. The diazotised amine may be coupled onto the component X-D-NH2 in an alkanol such as methanol and water at a temperature of from 0°C to 5°C.  The monoazo compound A-N=N-D-NH2 may be recovered from the reaction mixture by filtration.  The compound A-N=N-D-NH2 may be diazotised in an acidic medium such as acetic or sulphuric acid or mixtures thereof using a nitrosating agent as described above and coupled onto a component E-X in aqueous medium preferably whilst maintaining the pH at about 3.  The A-N=N-D-N=N-E product may be recovered from the reaction mixture by filtration and may be purified by slurrying in an alkanol such as methanol and refiltering.<br>
Fluorosulphonyl groups may be introduced into the dye compounds of Formula (1) or into the A, D and E components prior to coupling by methods generally available in the literature.  For example reaction of the dye compound of Formula (1), A-NH2, the NH2 being<br><br>
protected as necessary, or D-X in which A and D are as hereinbefore defined, with chlorosulphonic acid optionally in the presence of dimethylformamide and thicnylchloride at a temperature of from 30°C to 100°C gives the chlorosulphonyl derivative.  The chlorosulphonyl derivative may be reacted in boiling aqueous media with potassium fluoride to give the fluorosulphonyl derivative.<br>
Alternatively the dye compound of Formula (1), A-NH2, or D-X may be sulphonated with sulphuric acid or oleum to give the sulphonic acid derivative which may be converted to the chlorosulphonyl derivative by reaction, either of the free acid or an inorganic salt thereof, with thionylchloride optionally in the presence of a chlorophosphorus compound such as phosphorus oxychloride or phosphorus pentachioride in an organic liquid such as an aromatic hydrocarbon at a temperature of from 20°C to 110°C.  The chlorosulphonyl derivative may then be converted to the fluorosulphonyl derivative as described above.<br>
The dye compound of Formula (1) is useful for the coloration of synthetic textile materials particularly polyester textile materials and fibre blends thereof to which they impart colours which are excellent in wet and light fastness properties.<br>
The invention is further illustrated by the following Examples.<br>
