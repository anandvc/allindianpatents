The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br>
1 8 DEC 2008<br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVEHTION<br>
The invention relates to hair treatment compositions.  The compositions are particularly suitable for straightening hair and decreasing its volume.<br>
BACKGROI3ND AND PRIOR ART<br>
The use of xanthines in hair and skin pigmentation is described in US 5470579. US 4931066 discloses that xanthines can be used together with other compounds in hair dyeing.<br>
Xanthines have also been claimed as being useful in the treatment of hair loss.  For example, WO 85/05270, WO 84/04038 and WO 85/05272 all disclose hair loss treatments containing caffeine or theophylline as phosphodiesterase inhibitors. A hair nourishing lotion or shampoo containing caffeine and the hair loss treatment compound minoxidil is described in JP 04-193821.<br>
The present application discloses formulations and processes for straightening hair.  The invention has the further advantages that it prevents the hair frizzing and increasing in volume.<br><br>

Switch test protocol -<br>
A 8gm lOinch Asian wavy hair switch was used. Three switches were used for each prototype. The hair switch was subjected to shampoo, conditioner and after rinsing on the damp hair leave-on conditioner was applied. The switches were allowed to dry overnight at 25C and 50 %RH overnight. Next day all the switches were combed twice to break the water forces.<br>
Examples 1 to 4 gave superior straightening benefit to Comparative Examples A to C.<br>
Panel test protocol for Hair Volume -<br>
A pair comparison panel test was carried out to quantify low volume. 12 panellists were used to measure low volume. Each prototype was compare against Example 4 to quantify low volume.<br>
Examples<br>
Hair Low Volume	(<br><br>
Prototype	No. of times the panellist preferred	Significance<br>
4	33	Not Significant<br>
3	39	<br><br><br>
Prototype	No. of times the panellist preferred	Significance<br>

Hair Straightening<br>
Salon half head test -<br>
The salon test was carried out in Argentina. 12 wavy hair panellist were used for the test. The panellist hair (whole head) was subjected to shampoo and conditioner. Then the hair was divided in the middle and the Example 4 and Example A products were applied on respective half heads.  The results of panellist assessment of various attributes are shown in Figure 1.<br><br>
