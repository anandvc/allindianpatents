PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :<br><br>
Field of the present invention<br>
The present invention relates to new adjuvants and their uses in pharmaceutical compositions, like in vaccines. In particular, the present invention provides new compounds useful as adjuvants and/or immunomodulators for prophylactic and/or therapeutic vaccination in the treatment of infectious diseases, inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases, tumours, allergies as well as for the control of fertility in human or animal populations. The compounds are particularly useful not only as systemic, but preferably as mucosal adjuvants. In addition, the invention relates to its uses as active ingredients in pharmaceutical compositions.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Infectious diseases are the major cause of morbidity and mortality, accounting for a third of the deaths which occur in the world each year. In addition, infectious agents are directly responsible for at least 15% of new cancers, and they also seem to be involved in the pathophysiology of several chronic diseases (e.g. inflammatory, vascular and degenerative diseases). Traditional infectious diseases are also highly expensive in terms of health-associated costs of infected patients and loss in productivity at work.<br>
The main strategies used to prevent infectious diseases are therapy and prophylaxis. Vaccination has become the most cost-effective measure to prevent infections. However, there are still many diseases for which vaccines are not yet available or the available vaccines are not completely satisfactory due to low efficacy, high reactogenicity, poor stability and/or high costs. Thus, there is still an urgent need for both new and improved vaccines.<br>
Despite the fact that vaccines have traditionally been used for the prophylaxis of infectious diseases, recent findings suggest that they are also a powerful tool for the immunotherapy of transmissible diseases (e.g. viral hepatitis, Helicobacter pylori infections, herpes virus infections, etc.). In addition, vaccines can be used for the immune-therapy or immune-prophylaxis of autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases, tumours, allergies and for the control of fertility in human and/or animal populations.  In particular, the<br>
2<br><br>
latter application seems to require the elicitation of efficient mucosal responses at the level of the reproductive tract.<br>
Most infectious diseases are either restricted to the mucosal membranes or the etiologic agents need to transit the mucosa during the early steps of the infection. Therefore, it is desirable to obtain not only a systemic, but also a local mucosal immune response as a result of vaccination, thereby blocking both infection (i.e. colonization) and disease development. This may result in a more efficient protection against infection, facilitating also the eradication of diseases for which humans are the only reservoirs (i.e. blocking transmission to susceptible hosts). Parenterally-administered vaccines mainly stimulate systemic responses, whereas vaccines administered by a mucosal route mimic the immune response elicited by natural infections and can lead to efficient mucosal and systemic responses. Due to the apparent compartimentalization of the systemic and mucosal immune system, parenterally administered vaccines are less effective in protecting against mucosal pathogens (McGhee, J.R., Mestecky, J., Dertzbaugh, M.T., Eldridge, J.H., Hirasawa, M. and Kiyono, H. (1992) The mucosal immune system: from fundamental concepts to vaccine development. Vaccine 10, 75-88). Thus, administration of immunogens through the mucosal route is required to achieve full protection. However, most of the available vaccines are administered through the parenteral route, thereby, eliciting a systemic immunity in the individual.<br>
The administration of vaccines via the mucosal route offers several advantages over parenteral vaccination. These advantages include an ease of administration, the possibility of self-administration (e.g. by intranasal, rectal or oral application), the elimination of the chance of unwanted cross-infection due to the use of infected needles or non-sterile working, lower rates of side effects, higher acceptance by the public, better compliance of vaccination protocols (i.e. increment in the overall efficacy), simpler administration logistics and lower delivery costs, being particularly suitable for mass immunization programmes. However, the compartmentalisation at the level of the mucosal  immune  system has to be taken into  consideration.  In  fact,<br>
3<br><br>
immune responses which can be observed following intra-nasal vaccination may not necessarily occur after oral or intra-rectal immunisation. For example, oral vaccination may not stimulate efficient responses in the genitourinary and/or respiratory tracts.<br>
Unfortunately, the delivery of antigens by the mucosal route is associated with a major problem, namely that antigens delivered by this route are generally poorly immunogenic. This is the result of different mechanisms, such as (i) accelerated antigen elimination by the non specific host clearance mechanisms (e.g. ciliar activity, peristaltism), (ii) antigen degradation by local enzymes, (iii) antigen alteration and/or structural modification as a result of extreme pH (e.g. acidic in the stomach, alkaline in the intestine), (iv) poor antigen penetration through the mucosa, (v) limited access of vaccine antigens to antigen presenting cells, and (vi) local peripheral tolerance.<br>
To overcome these problems, different strategies have been used, such as antigen entrapment or association with physical or biological particles (e.g. microparticles, nanoparticles, bacterial ghosts), the use of virosomes or viral-like-particles, the use of liposomes or ISCOMS, the use of transgenic plants, antigen production by attenuated viral or bacterial carriers acting either as conventional vectors or as carriers for nucleic acid vaccines and/or their administration with mucosal adjuvants. However, despite the heavy body of experimental evidence generated in pre-clinical studies during the last years, almost no candidates have been transferred to the vaccine development pipeline.<br>
The use of optimal adjuvants plays a crucial role in vaccination. Antigens administered without adjuvant only rarely mediate an adequate immune response. In addition, not only the strength but also the quality of the elicited immune response matters. Stimulation of an incorrect immunization pattern may lead to immunopathological reactions and exacerbation of the symptoms of infection. In this context, the adjuvant can help to assist the desired immune response. In other words, an adjuvant can modulate the immune response or redirect the immune response to balance the immune response in<br>
4<br><br>
the desired direction.<br>
Substances referred to as "adjuvants" are those which are added and/or co-formulated in an immunization to the actual antigen (i.e. the substance which provokes the desired immune response) in order to enhance the humoral and/or cell-mediated immune response ("Lexikon der Biochemie und Molekularbiologie", 1. Band, Spektrum, Akademischer Verlagl995). That is, adjuvants are compounds having immunopotentiating properties, in particular, when co-administered with antigens. The use of many adjuvants is based solely on experience, and the effect can neither be accurately explained nor predicted. The following groups of adjuvants are traditionally used in particular: aluminum hydroxide, emulsions of mineral oils, saponins, detergents, silicon compounds, thiourea, endotoxins of gram-negative bacteria, exotoxins of gram-positive bacteria, killed or attenuated living bacteria or parts thereof.<br>
An overview over the presently known mucosal adjuvants and delivery systems, e.g. the above mentioned particles, ICOMS, liposomes and viral-like particles, for protein-, DNA- and RNA-based vaccines is given in Vajdy et al., Immunol. Cell Biol., 2004, 82, 617 - 627. Therein the currently available approaches in immunopentiation of mucosal vaccines are discussed.<br>
That is, various mucosal adjuvants have been described which should serve as an alternative for the adjuvants useful for systemic administration, e.g. see Vajdy et al., supra. These mucosal adjuvants include heat labile enterotoxin and detoxified mutants thereof. In particular, genetically detoxified mutants of heat labile enterotoxin of E. coli have been developed as useful mucosal adjuvants. Moreover, cholera toxin of vibrio cholera is known as an adjuvant-useful for mucosal vaccination. Further, the application of unmethylated CpG dinucleotides has been described. It was shown that CpG can bias the immune response towards a Thl response and can modulate pre-existing immune responses. Saponins are also described as immunomodulatory substances, predominantly via the induction of specific cytokines which then modulate and/or activate the immune response.<br>
5<br><br>
In addition, as adjuvants which may be useful in mucosal vaccination the following have been described:<br>
The MALP-2 molecule and Bisaxcyloxypropylcysteine-conjugates thereof, e.g. a Bispalmitoyloxypropylcysteine-PEG molecule is known to represent potent stimulants for macrophages. The usefulness of MALP-2 as an adjuvant was shown previously, see e.g. WO2004/009125 and WO2003/084568. In particular, it was demonstrated that MALP-2 can act as an effective mucosal adjuvant enhancing the mucosal immune response, e.g. fostering an enhanced expression of antigen-specific IgA antibodies.<br>
Furthermore, it was shown that MALP-2 can activate dendritic cells and B-cells, both play an important role in the induction of a specific humoral immune response. In addition, preliminary studies demonstrate that a combination of biologically active HIV-1 tat protein and synthetic MALP-2 may be a promising vaccine with the MALP-2 component as an effective mucosal adjuvant.<br>
Unfortunately, most of the compounds described above being useful as mucosal adjuvants are not utilisable due to their intrinsic toxicity, e.g. retrograde homing to neuronal tissues of bacterial toxoids and/or toxins at/in the derivatives after nasal vaccination.<br>
Thus, none of these previously described mucosal adjuvants have been approved yet, but, today, only two systemic adjuvants received approval to be administered to humans and, hence, are used for the preparation of human vaccines. These adjuvants are Alum and MF59. However, both are not effective as mucosal adjuvants.<br>
There has been an intensive search in recent years for novel adjuvants, including those for the mucosal administration route. Only a few substances have been found to be able to enhance mucosal responses. Among these, some act as carriers to which the antigens must be bound or fused thereto. Far fewer universally employable "true" adjuvants which are admixed to the antigens<br>
6<br><br>
have been found, as outlined above.<br>
Prokaryotic as well as eukaryotic cells use various small molecules for cell signaling and intra- and intercellular communication. For example, cyclic nucleotides like cGMP, cAMP, etc are known to have regulatory and initiating activity in pro- and eukaryotic cells. While in eukaryotic cells cAMP and cGMP are used as signalling molecules, prokaryotic cells utilize cyclic di-nucleoside mono phosphate molecules, in particular cyclic diguanosine-mono-phosphate (c-diGMP) beside cAMP.<br>
The condensation of two GTP molecules is catalyst by the enzyme diguanylate cyclase (DGC) to give c-diGMP. C-diGMP has been described as a molecule having anti-microbial activity und may be. used to prevent or combat pathogens. Moreover, it was shown that c-diGMP represents one of the key regulators in bacteria. Further, it is known that eukaryotic cells do not use the c-diGMP molecule in its biochemical pathways. In bacterial cells, c-diGMP regulates the expression of genes and the biosynthesis of exo-polysaccharides. Since interacting ligands of c-diGMP are expressed throughout the various genuses of bacteria, it is assumed that most bacteria use c-diGMP as a regulatory molecule.<br>
In WO 2005/087238, it has been speculated that cyclic diGMP or analogs thereof can stimulate or enhance immune or inflammatory response in a patient or can enhance the immune response to a vaccine by serving as an adjuvant. Further, it is speculated that cyclic diGMP or its analogs may be used as active ingredient in compositions for treating injuries, diseases, disorders and conditions that result in neurodegeneration. Therein, data are provided showing that cyclic diGMP does not modulate DC endocytic activity but may activate dendritic cells due to induction- of expression of co-stimulatory molecules. Further, data are provided showing that occasionally c-diGMP may upregulate immunostimulatory capacitiy of dendritic cells. Further, data are provided showing that c-diGMP in high doses may activate T-cells in vitro when mixed with dendritic cells. However, any enhancement of immune or inflammatory responses in a patient or enhancement of the<br>
7<br><br>
immune response to a vaccine by serving as an adjuvant is not shown, rather it is speculated therein that there are some data which may indicate for an increased presentation of antigen through stimulation of HLA-DR. Further, no immunomodulatory action of cyclic diGMP is shown in said document. Hence, this document merely speculates about any immunomodulatory, in particular, about any enhanced immune response by serving as an adjuvant. As discussed before, an adjuvant is a compound able to provoke or enhance the humoral and/or cell mediated immune response against an active antigen. No data are provided in WO 2005/087238 showing an immune response against an active antigen using c-diGMP as adjuvant for enhancing or eliciting or modulating said immune response. In addition, it is noted that said document only provides information regarding c-diGMP but not with respect to any other analogs of cyclic diGMP.<br>
Hence, there is still a need in the prior art to provide new compounds useful as adjuvants, particularly as mucosal adjuvants and/or as vaccines. In particular, there is a need for mucosal adjuvants which can elicit a strong immune response which represent a balanced or adjusted immune response involving both humoral and cellular components, thus, allowing effective prophylaxis or treatment of various diseases and conditions, specifically of infectious diseases or cancer.<br>
Thus, the object of the present invention is the provision of mucosal adjuvants which can elicit and/or enhance and/or modulate (pre-existing) immune response in an individual or subject. In particular, the invention was based on the object of developing a range of novel, highly active adjuvants, particularly mucosal adjuvants which are non-toxic for humans and which can be employed with a wide variety of active ingredients to be assisted in conventional or novel vaccines such as, in particular, prophylactic or therapeutic vaccines, including cancer and DNA vaccines.<br>

In the most preferred embodiment, the compound of formula (I) is cyclic Bis(3'-5')adenylic acid, which is also referred to as c-di-AMP in the following, or the pegylated conjugate.<br>
12<br><br>
With the term "which may be substituted" is meant the substitution with a straight or branched C1-C6 alkyl group or a straight or branched C1-C6 alkoxy group and/or with a halogen, hydroxyl group or carboxyl group.<br>
The conjugate moiety of the conjugate according to the present invention is a covalently bonded, physiologically tolerated conjugate moiety, which is suitable for converting the compounds according to formula (I) into a more water-soluble form. For example, the conjugate moiety can be a polymer, a dextran, a sugar, a polyvinylpyrrolidone, an alginate, a pectin or collagen. The conjugate moiety is characterized in that is provides good water and is not immunogenic. The conjugate moiety may be covalently bound with the residue.<br>
The conjugate moiety of the conjugate claimed herein, is in a preferred embodiment, a conjugate moiety containing at least one polyalkylene glycol unit of the formula:<br>

Particularly preferred is the conjugate moiety a methoxypolyalkyleneglycol-carbonyl-residue wherein the alkylene moiety is an ethylene or propylene moiety.<br>
Hence, preferably the conjugates are in a pegylated form to increase the solubility in hydrophilic solvents and hydrophilic environment. Furthermore, the conjugate moiety allows protecting the compound moiety, i.e. the active mucosal adjuvant moiety, against enzymatic degradation, structural modification due to change of the pH, mechanical removal, etc. Thus, primarily the stability of the compound is increased. Another beneficial effect of conjugation is to increase the retention time in the individual, e.g. to delay the renal excretion, while being well-tolerated, e.g. being non immunogenic, by said organism. Further, the conjugates, in particular pegylated conjugates improve the bioavailability 0f the compounds and allow to reduce the dosage administered to the individual.<br>

20<br><br>
pharmaceutical compositions comprise a therapeutically effective amount of the conjugates and, optionally, a pharmaceutical^ acceptable carrier. The pharmaceutical composition may be administered with a physiologically acceptable carrier to a patient, as described herein. In a specific embodiment, the term "pharmaceutically acceptable" means approved by a regulatory agency or other generally recognized pharmacopoeia for use in animals, and more particularly in humans. The term "carrier" refers to a diluent, adjuvant, excipient, or vehicle with which the therapeutic is administered. Such pharmaceutical carriers can be sterile liquids, such as water and oils, including those of petroleum, animal, vegetable or synthetic origin, such as peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil and the like.

That result can be alleviation of the signs, symptoms, or causes of a disease, or any other desired alteration of a biological  system. In the present invention, the result will typically<br>
22<br><br>
involve an increase in the immunological responses to infection or a suppression of the responses to inflammatory processes.<br>
In vitro assays may optionally be employed to help identifying optimal dosage ranges. The precise dose to be employed in the formulation will also depend on the route of administration, and the seriousness of the disease or disorder, and should be decided according to the judgment of the practitioner and each patient's circumstances. Effective doses may be extrapolated from dose-response curves derived from in vitro or animal model test systems. Preferably, the pharmaceutical composition is administered directly or in combination with an adjuvant.<br>
The term "administered" means administration of a therapeutically effective dose of the aforementioned pharmaceutical composition comprising the conjugates containing the compound according to formula (I), salts and solvates thereof as defined herein to an individual. By "therapeutically effective amount" is meant a dose that produces the effects for which it is administered. The exact dose will depend on the purpose of the treatment, and will be ascertainable by one skilled in the art using known techniques. As is known in the art and described above, adjustments for systemic versus localized delivery, age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, drug interaction and the severity of the condition may be necessary, and will be ascertainable with routine experimentation by those skilled in the art.<br>

Examples<br>
1.        In   vitro   stimulation   of  primary   bone   marrow-derived   murine dendritic cells with c-diGMP<br>
Experimental protocol: primary bone marrow-derived dendritic cell cultures were obtained from BALB/c mice following in vitro maturation of precursors in the presence of recombinant GM-CSF (5 x 104 U/ml), according to established protocols, e.g. Link,C, etal, 2004, Eur.J.Immuol, 34(3):899-907. Mature dendritic cells were stimulated with 10 ng/ml of E. coli lypopolysaccharide (LPS) or 10 ng/ml c-diGMP. The stimulation of cells was analyzed by flow cytometry to assess the expression of surface markers which are relevant for their antigen presentation capacity after 12 h and 24 h, respectively.<br>
In order to identify compounds which may have potential as adjuvants for in vivo applications in the field of vaccines, a first in vitro screening based on the use of primary cultures of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells was established. Dendritic cells were selected since they represent the most efficient antigen presenting cells and they play a key role in primary immune responses. In fact, they represent the only cell type able to activate resting T cells initiating primary immune responses in vivo. Thus, dendritic cell cultures were treated with the tested title compounds or LPS, which was used as a positive control. At different time intervals, samples were taken, stained with fluorescent-labeled antibodies specific for cellular markers critical for the antigen presenting capacities of dendritic cells, and analyzed by flow cytometry.<br>
The obtained results (Fig. 1) demonstrated that in contrast to the control, group which received no c-diGMP, the expression of CD40 was up-regulated in the c-diGMP treated dendritic cells. Co-stimulatory molecules deliver signals which are essential for the efficient activation of T cells in addition to the presentation of the processed epitopes in the context of the MHC class II molecules. It has been previously reported that the adjuvanticity of well-<br>
29<br><br>
established mucosal adjuvants, such as cholera toxin, involves the selective up-regulation of the expression of co-stimulatory molecules. Thus, these in vitro results strongly argue for a high potential of c-diGMP as mucosal adjuvants.<br>
2. Intranasal and intraperitoneal co-administration of c-diGMP and c-diAMP with a soluble antigen stimulates efficient systemic humoral responses<br>
Experimental protocol: six-eight weeks-old female BALB/c (H-2d) mice were purchased from Harlan Winkelmann GmbH (Borchen, Germany) and treated in accordance with local and European Community guidelines. Groups of 5 mice each were immunized on day 1, 14 and 28 with 30 \xg of B-gal (Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany), alone or as an admixture with 10 ug c-diGMP or with 10ug c-diAMP. For intranasal (i.n.) immunization, 10 \x\ were applied to each naris, whereas for the s.c. injection B-gal with or without c-diGMP or c-diAMP was resuspended in a volume of 20 ul PBS per animal. Serum samples were collected at day 38 after immunization and stored at -20°C prior to determination of B-gal-specific antibodies. 96-well Nunc-Immuno MaxiSorp assay plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) were coated with 100 ul of B-gal (Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany) at 5 µg/ml in 0.05 M carbonate buffer (pH 8.2) per well. Serial two-fold dilutions of sera in PBS with 1% BSA and 0.05% Tween 20 were added (100 µl/well), and plates incubated for 16h at 37°C. After washing, biotinylated y-chain-specific goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma Chemie, Deisenhofen, Germany) was added, and plates were incubated for an additional 1 h at 37°C. After four washes, 100 ul of peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Pharmingen) was added to cells and plates incubated at 37°C for 30 min. After four washes, reactions were developed with ABTS in 0.1 M citrate-phosphate buffer (pH 4.35) containing 0.01% H2O2. Results for c-diGMP are shown as OD405 values after serial two-fold dilutions (Fig. 2). As demonstrated in Fig. 2, the IgG-titer was remarkably increased when using c-diGMP. The effect of c-diGMP as an adjuvant was independent of the route of administration. The same can be seen using c-diAMP as an adjuvant, see Fig.3.<br>
30<br><br>
Considering the encouraging results obtained in the preliminary studies, it was decided to analyze in detail the immune responses obtained by stimulating with c-diAMP as adjuvant by the two most effective routes, namely s.c. and i.n. Thus, the capacity of c-diAMP to stimulate efficient humoral immune responses was evaluated, by determining the serum titers of B-gal-specific antibodies in vaccinated mice. As shown in Fig. 11, i.n. administration of B-gal alone (30 µg/dose) resulted in the induction of very low antibody titers. In contrast, in the presence of c-diAMP, i.n. administration of B-gal induced very high titers of specific IgG in all mice with titers higher than 500,000 (Fig. 11).<br>
In view of the above in vitro results, additional in vivo studies have been conducted. In detail, the immune responses using B-gal alone or as an admixture with c-diGMP and c-diAMP, respectively, as adjuvant applied by the two most effective routes, namely s.c. and i.n. were determined. Thus, the capacity of c-diGMP and c-diAMP, respectively, to stimulate efficient humoral immune responses was evaluated, by determining the serum titers of B-gal-specific antibodies in vaccinated mice.<br>
3.        Intranasal   co-administration   of   c-diGMP   or   c-diAMP   with   a soluble antigen stimulate efficient mucosal antibody responses<br>
Experimental protocol: at day 38, mice were sacrificed and the final sampling was performed. Vaginal and lung lavages were obtained by flushing the organs with 1 ml of PBS supplemented with 50 mM EDTA, 0.1% BSA, and 10 mM PMSF. Lavages were then centrifuged to remove debris (10 min at 3000 x g), and supernatant fluids were stored at -20°C. To determine the concentration of total IgA present in the lung and vaginal lavages, serial dilutions of the corresponding samples were incubated in microtiter plates that were previously coated with goat anti-mouse IgA (Sigma Chemie), as capture antibodies (100 µl/well). Serial dilutions of purified mouse IgA (Sigma Chemie) were used to generate a standard curve.<br>

To investigate the capacity of c-diGMP and c-diAMP, respectively, to stimulate mucosal responses against antigens co-administered by the i.n. and s.c. route, the production of B-gal-specific IgA in lung was analyzed (Fig. 5 for c-diAMP and Fig.4 for c-diGMP) from immunized animals, immunized according to the protocol described in Example 2. While i.n. immunization with B-gal alone resulted in a weak production of detectable levels of B-gal-specific IgA in lung lavages, a significant increase in the levels of antigen-specific IgA was detected in animals immunized with B-gal and c-dGMP (Fig. 4) and c-diAMP (Fig. 5). Further, in vaginal lavage B-gal specific slgA expression is detectable using c-diAMP as an adjuvant (Fig. 5) while c-diGMP does not lead to an enhanced expression of specific slgA in the vaginal lavage by the s.c. route (not shown).<br>
4.        c-diGMP    and    c-diAMP    stimulate   efficiently    T    cell-mediated proliferative responses when co-administered with soluble antigens<br>
Experimental protocol: Spleens were removed and pooled for analysis of cellular immune responses. Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 U/ml of penicillin, 50 ug/ml of streptomycin, 5 x 10"5 M 2-mercaptoethanol and 1 mM L-glutamine (GIBCO BRL, Karlsruhe, Germany) and maintained at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Spleen cell suspensions were adjusted to 5 x 106 cells/ml in complete medium, cells were seeded with 100 \i\ per well in a flat-bottomed 96-well microtiter plate (Nunc) and plates were incubated for 4 days in the presence of different concentrations of soluble B-gal. That is, T cell mediated immune responses were investigated at day 38 by measuring the proliferation after in vitro restimulation with B-Gal of cells which have been recovered from spleens before. Said spleen cells were obtained from vaccinated mice -said mice where immunized as described in Example 2 - and incubated in the presence of different concentrations of the soluble B-Gal antigen. Each concentration was tested in quadruplicates. During the final 18 h of culture, 1 uCi of [3H]thymidine (Amersham International, Freiburg, Germany) was added to each well. Cells were then harvested on paper filters (Filtermat A; Wallac,  Freiburg,  Germany)  by  using  a  cell  harvester  (Inotech,  Wohlen,<br>
32<br><br>
Switzerland), and the amount of incorporated [3H]thymidine into the DNA of proliferating cells was determined by a β-scintillation counter (Wallac 1450, Micro-Trilux). The results are expressed as the arithmetic mean of [3H]thymidine uptake in cpm.<br>
Thirty eight days following vaccination, spleens cells were purified, re-stimulated in vitro in the presence of various amounts of B-galactosidase and their proliferative capacity was estimated by measuring the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into their DNA using a B-scintillation counter. Spleen cells from animals immunized by s.c. injection of β-gal alone, which were chosen as a control, exhibited a significant proliferative response as compared to the non immunized group (Fig. 6 A/B for c-diGMP, Fig. 6C/D for c-diAMP). A further increase in proliferation was noted in spleen cells from animals co-administrated with c-diGMP and c-diAMP, respectively, and antigen. While i.n. administration of B-gal alone failed to induce detectable cellular proliferation, co-administration of c-diGMP and c-diAMP, respectively, triggered the induction of an efficient proliferative response at low amounts of antigen (see Fig. 6).<br>
Of note, the T cell proliferative response was observed with spleen cells of mice immunized with c-diGMP and c-diAMP, respectively, and B-gal administered by the i.n. and the s.c. route, respectively (see Fig. 6).<br>
In all cases a dosis dependent effect was observed when increasing the concentration of B-gal in the re-stimulation experiment. Thus, the use of the new adjuvants c-diGMP and c-diAMP, respectively, resulted in a statistically significant increment of the T cell proliferation after i.n. and s.c. administration. These results demonstrate that c-diGMP and c-diAMP, respectively, can increase the cellular immune response.<br>
In addition, the results confirm that other purine based cyclic dinucleotides display the same effect.<br>
33<br><br>
5.        Analysis of the T helper patterns stimulated by using c-diGMP and c-diAMP, respectively, as adjuvant<br>
Isotyp ELISA: 96-well Nunc-Immuno MaxiSorp assay plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) were coated with 100 ul of B-gal (Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany) at 5 |ig/ml in 0.05 M carbonate buffer (pH 9,6) per well. Serial two-fold dilutions of sera or lavages in PBS with 1% BSA and 0.05% Tween 20 were added (100 ul/well), and plates incubated for 2 h at 37°C. After washing, biotin-conjugated rat anti-mouse IgGl or IgG2a (Pharmingen, Hamburg, Germany) were added to determine IgG subclasses. Plates were incubated for an additional 1 h at 37°C. After four washes, 100 ul of peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Pharmingen) was added to cells and plates incubated at 37°C for 30 min. After four washes, reactions were developed with ABTS in 0.1 M citrate-phosphate buffer (pH 4.35) containing 0.01% H2O2. To determine the concentration of IgG subclasses in serum, standard curves were obtained by coating the wells with an isotype-specific goat anti-mouse IgG, and then by incubating with purified mouse IgGl or IgG2 antibodies (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany).<br>
The pattern of the different subclasses of the β-gal antigen-specific IgG isotypes present in the sera of vaccinated mice is shown in Fig 12. Fig.l2A shows the results for intranasal administration of β-Gal alone, β-Gal and c-diAMP. The protocol for vaccination was identical to the protocol described in Example 3. As can be ascertained from Fig. 12A, the amount of antigen specific antibodies of the IgGlsubtype and the IgG2a isotype were strongly increased after intranasal administration of the antigen using c-diAMP as mucosal adjuvant. Further, also in case of systemic administration, here subcutaneous administration, the expression of the IgGl isotype as well as of th IgG2a isotype are strongly increased, see Fig.l2B. The data represents the average titer of a group of 5 animals.<br>
Thus, the use of c-diAMP allows eliciting a strong antigen-specific antibody response. The triggering can be seen not only after intranasal administration but also after parenteral administration.<br>
34.<br><br>
Experimental protocol: Spleens from mucosal (i.n.) or parenteral (s.c.) vaccinated mice were removed and pooled for analysis of cellular immune responses. The protocol for vaccination was identical to the protocol described in Example 2. Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 U/ml of penicillin, 50 ug/ml of streptomycin, 5 x 10"5 M 2-mercaptoethanol and 1 mM L-glutamine (GIBCO BRL, Karlsruhe, Germany) and maintained at 37°C in a humidified 5 % CO2 atmosphere. Spleen cell suspensions were adjusted to 5 x 106 cells/ml in complete medium, cells were seeded with 100 αl per well in a flat-bottomed 96-well microtiter plate (Nunc) and plates were incubated for 4 days in the presence of different concentrations of soluble β-gal.<br>
To characterize the type of Th response stimulated following immunization, the content of IFNy, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 (for c-diAMP only), MCP-1, and TNFa was measured in supernatants from in vitro re-stimulated spleen cells (Fig. 7 and 8 for c-diGMP and Fig. 9 for c-diAMP) by the Cytometric Bead Array. Culture supernatants from proliferating cells were collected on days 2 and 4, and stored at -70°C. Determination of IFNy, TNFa, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, and MCP-1 was performed by cytometric bead array (CBA) analysis using the commercial kit from BectonDickinson, according to the manufacturer's instructions or with commercially available ELISA systems. For CBA analysis, a standard curve was generated for each cytokine by using the corresponding recombinant murine cytokines (Pharmingen). Probes were incubated at room temperature for additional 2h. The probes were analyzed subsequently by flow cytometry as described in the protocol of BD.<br>
The levels of Thl specific cytokines, such as IFNy or TNFa, showed enhanced secretion in comparison to the control (β-Gal without additional adjuvant) as shown in Figure 7 for c-diGMP and IFNy and Fig.9 for c-diAMP. The same results can be observed for the inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and IL-6, see figure 8 and 9. The data shown for c-diGMP are obtained from spleen cells from intranasal immunized mice.<br>
35<br><br>
For c-diAMP the results confirm that a balanced Thl/Th2 response was induced in mice. The results show that not only antigen-specific IFNy and IL-2 secreting cells, but also IL-4 secreting cells were increased in number in mice receiving c-diGMP and c-diAMP as adjuvant.<br>
6.        Analysis of the T helper patterns stimulated by using c-diGMP and c-diAMP-PEG as adjuvant by Elispot<br>
Experimental protocol: Spleens from vaccinated mice were removed and pooled for analysis of cellular immune responses. The protocol for vaccination was identical to the protocol described in Example 2. Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 U/ml of penicillin, 50 µ.g/ml of streptomycin, 5 * 10"5 M 2-mercaptoethanol and 1 mM L-glutamine (GIBCO BRL, Karlsruhe, Germany) and maintained at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Spleen cell suspensions were adjusted to 5 x 106 cells/ml in complete medium, cells were seeded with 100 µl per well in a flat-bottomed 96-well microtiter plate (Nunc) and plates were incubated for 4 days in the presence of different concentrations of soluble B-Gal.<br>
For coating ELISPOT plates, said plates were incubated with 100 ul/well of purified capture antibody (10 µg/ml in coating buffer) at 4°C overnight. After 6x washing steps, the plates were blocked with 200 ul/well of complete RPMI-1640 at room temperature for 1 hour. The activated cells were seeded at 100 µl per well and incubate at 37°C, in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator for 24 hours or 48h hours. After 5x washing steps with washing buffer and lx step with distilled water, 100 ul/well of the biotinylated detection antibody with a concentration of 1 µig/ml in Assay Diluent was added and incubated at room temperature for 2 hrs. After further washing steps 100 µl/well of the AV-HRP at 1/1000 dilution in Assay Diluent was added and incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. After further washing steps 100 ul/well of AEC Substrate Solution was added and developed at room temperature for 10-60 minutes until visible spots appeared. After washing steps with (3x) with<br>
36<br><br>
200 µl/well distilled water, the plates were air-dried and analyzed by counting the spots by an ELISPOT reader. Each concentration was tested in triplicates.<br>
An increment in the number of splenic IFNy producing cells was observed in animals immunized with B-Gal co-administerd with c-diGMP or c-diAMP, in response to restimulation with a peptide encompassing the MHC class I-restricted immunodominant epitope from B-Galactosidase (CD8 epitope) after parenteral vaccination (Fig. 10). In contrast, INFy producing cells were scarcely detectable after i.n. administration of B-Gal. However, i.n. vaccination of B-gal with additional adjuvant c-diGMP, or c-diAMP resulted in amounts of IFNy expressing cells similar to the level determined after s.c. vaccination, see results for c-diGMP. Furthermore, a strong expression of splenic IL-2 and IL-4 producing cells after restimulation with the B-Gal protein was shown in mice immunized with B-Gal co-administered with the respective adjuvant by the i.n. and by the s.c. route.<br>
