Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to improved materials usable as electrode active materials and to their • preparation.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Lithium batteries are prepared from one or more lithium electrochemical cells containing<br>
•	electrochemically.active (electroactive) materials.  Such<br>
cells typically include an anode (negative electrode), a<br>
cathode (positive electrode), and an electrolyte<br>
interposed between spaced apart positive and negative<br>
electrodes.  Batteries with anodes of metallic lithium<br>
and containing metal chalcogenide cathode active material<br>
are. known.  The electrolyte typically comprises a salt of<br>
lithium dissolved in one or more solvents, typically<br>
nonaqueous (aprotic) organic solvents.  Other<br>
electrolytes are solid electrolytes typically called<br>
polymeric matrixes that contain'an ionic conductive<br>
medium, typically a metallic powder or salt, in<br>
combination with a polymer that itself may be ionically<br>
•	conductive which is electrically insulating.  By<br>
convention, during discharge of the cell, the negative<br>
electrode of the cell is defined as the anode.  Cells<br>
having- a metallic lithium anode, and metal chalcogenide<br>
cathode are charged in an initial condition.  During<br>
discharge, lithium ions from the metallic anode pass<br>
through-the liquid electrolyte to the electrochemical<br><br>
active (electroactive) material of the cathode whereupon they rel'ease electrical energy to an external circuit.<br>
It has recently been suggested to replace the lithium metal anode with an insertion anode, such as a lithium metal chalcogenide or lithium metal oxide. Carbon anodes, such as coke and graphite, are also insertion materials.  Such negative electrodes are used with lithium- containing insertion cathodes, in order to form an electroactive couple in a cell.  Such cells, in an initial condition, are not charged.  In order to be used to deliver electrochemical energy, such cells must be charged in order to transfer lithium to the anode from the lithium- containing cathode.  During discharge the lithium is transferred from the anode back to the cathode.  During a subsequent recharge, the lithium is transferred back to the anode where it re-inserts.  Upon, subsequent charge and discharge, the lithium ions (Li'^) are transported between the electrodes.  Such rechargeable batteries, having no free metallic species are called rechargeable ion batteries or rocking chair batteries.  See U.S. Patent Nos. 5,418,090; 4,464,447; • 4,194,062; and 5,130,211.<br>
Preferred positive electrode active materials include LiCoOz, LiMn204, and LiNiOz.  The cobalt compounds are relatively expensive and the' nickel compounds are difficult to synthesize.  A relatively economical positive electrode is LiMn204, for which methods of synthesis are known.  The lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoOj) , the lithium manganese oxide (LiMn204) , and the lithium nickel oxide (LiNiOs) all have a common disadvantage in that the charge capacity of a cell comprising such cathodes suffers a significant loss in capacity.  That<br><br><br>
is., the initial capacity available (amp hours/gram) from LiMn204, LiNiOj, and LiCoOj is less than the theoretical capacity because significantly less than 1 atomic unit of lithixim engages in the electrochemical reaction.  Such an initial capacity value is significantly diminished during the first cycle operation and such capacity further diminishes on every successive'cycle of operation.  For LilNliOz and LiCo02-only about 0.5 atomic units of lithium is reversibly cycled during cell operation.  Many attempts have been made to reduce capacity fading, for example, as described in U.S. Patent No. 4,828,834 by Nagaura .et al.  However," the presently known and commonly used, alkali transition metal oxide compounds suffer from relatively low capacity. Therefore, there remains, the difficulty of obtaining a lithium-containing electrode material having acceptable capacity without disadvantage of significant capacity loss when used in a cell.<br><br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The invention provides novel lithium-mixed metal materials which, upon electrochemical interaction, release lithium ions, and are capable of reversibly cycling lithium ions.  The invention provides a rechargeable lithium battery which comprises an electrode formed from the novel lithium-mixed metal materials. Methods for making the novel lithium-mixed metal materials and methods for using such lithium-mixed metal materials in electrochemical cells are also provided. The lithium-mixed metal materials comprise lithium and at least one'other metal besides lithium.  Preferred materials are lithium-mixed metal phosphates which •' contain lithium and two other metals'besides lithium. Accordingly, the invention provides a rechargeable lithium battery which comprises an electrolyte; a first electrode having a compatible active material; and a second electrode comprising the novel materials.  In one aspect, the novel m;aterials are lithium-mixed metal ■phosphates which preferably used as a positive electrode' active material, reversibly cycle lithium ions with the compatible negative electrode active material. Desirably, the lithium-mixed metal phosphate is represented by the nominal general formula LiaMIv,MIIc (PO4) d-  Such compounds include LiiMIaMIIbPO^ and LijMIaMIIt, (POJ 3; therefore, in an initial condition 0<a respectively. during cycling x quantity of lithium is released where a. in the general sum b plus c up to about specific examples are liimii.ymiiypo an lismiz-ymiiy></a>
In one aspect, MI and MII are the same.  In a preferred aspect, MI and MII are different from one<br><br>
another.  At least one of MI and MII is an element capable of an oxidation state higher than that initially present in the lithium-mixed metal phosphate compound. Correspondingly, at least one of MI and MII has more than one oxidation state in the phosphate compound, and more than one oxidation state above the ground state M°. The term oxidation state and valence state are used in the art interchangeably.<br>
In another aspect, both MI and MII may have ■ more'than one oxidation state and both may be oxidizable from the state initially present in the phosphate' compound.  Desirably, MII is a metal or semi-metal having a +2 oxidation state, and is selected from Groups 2, '12 and 14 of the Periodic Table.  Desirably, MII is selected from non-transition metals and semi-metals.  In one embodiment. MII has only one oxidation state and is nonoxidizable from its oxidation state in the lithium-mixed metal compound.  In another embodiment, MII has more than one oxidation state.  Examples of semi-metals having more than one oxidation state are selenium and tellurium; other non-transition metals with more than one oxidation state are tin and lead.  Preferably, MII is selected from Mg (magnesium), Ca (calcium), Zn (zinc), Sr (strontium) , Pb (lead), Cd (cadmium), Sn (tin), Ba (barium), and Be (beryllium), and mixtures thereof.  In another preferred aspect, MII is a metal having a +2 oxidation state and having more than one oxidation state, and is oxidizable from its oxidation state in lithium-mixed metal compound.<br>
Desirably, MI is selected from Fe (iron) ,. Co (cobalt),' Ni (nickel), Mn (manganese), Cu (copper), V (vanadium), Sn (tin), Ti (titanium), Cr (chromium), and<br><br>
mixtures thereof.  As can be seen, MI is preferably selected from the first row of transition metals and further includes tin, and MI preferably initially has a +2 oxidation state..<br>
In a preferred aspect, the product LiMIi.yMIIyPO^ is an olivine structure and the product LijMIi.y (PO4) 3 is a rhombohedral or monoclinic Nasicon structure.  In another aspect, the term "nominal formula" refers to the fact that the relative proportion of atomic species may vary slightly on the order of 2 percent to 5 percent, or more typically, 1 percent to 3 percent.  In still another aspect,.any portion of P (phosphorous) may be substituted by Si (silicon), S (sulfur), and/or As (arsenic); and any portion of 0 (oxygen) may be substituted by halogen, preferably F (fluorine).  These aspects are also disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Serial Numbers 09/105,748 filed June 26, 1998, and 09/274,371 filed March 23, 1999;- and in U.S. Patent No. 5,871,856 issued February 16, 1999, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety; each of the listed applications and patents are co-owned by the assignee of the present invention.<br>
The metal phosphates are alternatively represented by the nominal general formulas such as , Lii.^MIi-yMIIyPO^ (0 
signifying capability to release and reinsert lithium. The term "general" refers to a faMIIy of compounds, with M, X and y representing variations therein.  The expressions 2-y and 1-y each signify that the relative amount of MI and MII may vary.  In addition, as stated above, MI may be a mixture of metals meeting the earlier stated criteria for MI.  In addition, MIX may be a mixture of metallic elements meeting the stated criteria<br><br>
for MII.  Preferably, where MII is a mixture, it is a mixture of 2 metallic elements; and where MI is a mixture, it is a mixture of 2 metals.  Preferably, each such metal and metallic element has a +2 oxidation state in the initial phosphate compound.<br>
The active material of the counter electrode is any material compatible with the lithium-mixed metal phosphate of the invention.  Where the lithium-mixed metal phosphate is used as a positive electrode active material, metallic lithium, lithium-containing material, or non-lithium-containing material may be used as the negative electrode active material.  The negative electrode is desirably a nonmetallic insertion material. Desirably, the negative electrode comprises an active material from the group consisting of metal oxide, particularly transition metal oxide, metal chalcogenide, carbon, graphite, and mixtures thereof.  It is preferred that the anode active material comprises a carbonaceous material such as graphite.  The lithium-mixed metal phosphate of the invention may also be used as a negative electrode material.<br>
In another enibodiment, the present invention provides a method of preparing a compound, of the nominal general formula LiaMIbMII^ (POJd where 0 
 <br>
Preferably, the lithiuin-containiay compouna xs  in particle form, and an example is lithium salt. Preferably, the phosphate-containing anion compound is in particle form, and examples include metal phosphate salt and diammonium hydrogen phosphate.(DAHP) and ammonium . dihydrogen phosphate (ADHP).  The lithium compound, one, or more metal compounds,- and phosphate compound are included in a proportion which provides the stated nominal general formula.  The starting materials are mixed together with carbon, which is included in an amount sufficient to reduce the metal ion of one or more of the metal-containing starting materials without full reduction to an elemental metal state.  Excess quantities of carbon and one or more other starting materials (i.e., 5 to 10% excess) may be used to enhance product quality. A small amount of carbon, remaining after the reaction, functions as a conductive constituent in the ultimate electrode formulation.  This is an advantage since such remaining carbon is very intimately mixed with the product active material. Accordingly, large quantities of excess carbon, on the order of 100% excess  carbon are useable in the process.  The carbon present during compound formation is thought to be intimately dispersed throughout the precursor and product.  This provides many advantages, including the enhanced conductivity of the product.  The presence of carbon particles in the starting materials is also thought to provide nucleation sites for the production of the product crystals.<br>
The starting, materials are intimately mixed and then reacted together where the reaction is initiated by heat and is preferably conducted in a nonoxidizing, inert atmosphere, whereby the lithium, metal from the metal compound(s), and phosphate combine to form the<br><br><br>
tJie particles are intermingled to form an essentially homogeneous powder mixture of the precursors.  In one aspect, the precursor powders are dry-mixed using a ball MIIl, such as zirconia media.  Then the mixed powders are pressed into pellets.  In another aspect, the precursor powders are mixed with a binder.  The. binder is selected so as to not inhibit reaction betw.een particles of the powders.  Therefore, preferred binders decompose or evaporate at a temperature less than the reaction temperature..  Examples include mineral oils (i.e., glycerol, or C-18 hydrocarbon mineral oil) and polymers which decompose (carboniz.e) to form a carbon residue before the reaction starts, or which evaporate before the reaction starts.  In still another aspect, intermingling is conducted by forming a wet mixture using a volatile solvent and then the intermingled particles are pressed together in pellet form to provide good grain-to-grain contact.<br>
Although it is desired that the precursor compounds be present in a proportion which provides the stated general forit|ula of the product, the lithium compound may be present in an excess amount on the order • • of 5 percent excess lithium.compared to a stoichiometric mixture of the precursors.  And the carbon may be.present at up to 100% excess compared to the stoichiometric amount.  The method of' the invention may also be used to prepare other novel products, and to prepare known products.  A number of lithium compounds are available as precursors, such as lithium acetate■(LiOOCCHa) , lithium hydroxide, lithium nitrate (LiNOj) , lithium oxalate (LizCjO^) , lithium oxide (LizO) , lithium phosphate (LisPOJ , lithium dihydrogen phosphate (LiHzPO^) , lithium<br><br><br>
lithium carbonate is preferred for the solid state reaction since it has a very high melting-point and coinmonly reacts with 'the other precursors before melting. Lithium carbonate has a melting point over 600°C and it decomposes in the presence of the other precursors and/or effectively reacts with the other precursors before melting. In contrast^ lithium hydroxide melts at about 400°C.  At some reaction temperatures preferred herein of over 450°C the lithium hydroxide will melt before any significant reaction with' the other precursors occurs to an effective extent.  This melting renders the reaction very difficult to control.  In addition, anhydrous LiOH -'is highly hygroscopic and a significant quantity of water is released during the reaction.  Such water needs to be removed from the oven and the resultant product may need to be dried.  In one preferred aspect, the solid state reaction made possible by the present invention is much preferred since it is conducted at temperatures at which the lithium-containing compound reacts with the other reactants before melting.  Therefore, lithium hydroxide is useable as a precursor in the method of the invention in combination with some precursors, particularly the phosphates.  The method of the invention is able to be conducted as an sconomical carbothermal-based process with a wide variety of precursors and over a relatively broad temperature range.<br>
The aforesaid precursor compounds (starting materials) are generally crystals, granules, and powders .and are generally referred to as being in particle form. Although many types of phosphate salts are known, it is preferred to use diammonium hydrogen phosphate (NHJ2HPO4 (DAHP) or ammonium dihydrogen phosphate- (NH4)H2P04 (ADHP) .<br><br>
Both ADHP and DAHP meet the preferred criteria that the precursors decompose in "the presence of one another or react with one another before melting of such precursor. ■Exemplary metal compounds are FezOj, FejO^, V2O5, VO,, LiVOa, NH4VO3, Mg(0H)2, Cao, MgO, Ca(0H)2, MnOj, MnzOj, Mn3(POj2A 'CuO, SnO, Sn02, TiOz, TijOs, Cr203, PbOj, PbO, Ba(0H)2, BaO, Cd(0H)2.  In addition, some starting materials serve as both the  source of metal ion "and phosphate, such as FePO^, FesfPOJjr Zn^iPO^)^,   and Mg3(P04)2.  Still others contain both lithium ion and phosphate such as Li3P04 and LiHjPO^.  Other exemplary precursors are H3PO4 (phosphoric acid); and P2O5 '(P4O10) phosphoric oxide; and HPO3 meta phosphoric■acid, which is a decomposition product of P2O5. If it is desired to■' replace any of the oxygen with a halogen; such as fluorine, the starting materials further include a fluorine compound such as LiF.  If it is desired to replace any of the phosphorous with silicon, then the starting materials further include silicon oxide (SiOg) . SiMIIarly, ammonium sulfate in the starting materials is useable to replace phosphorus with sulfur.<br>
The starting materials are available from a number of sources. The following- are typical. Vanadium pentoxide of the formula V2O5 is obtainable from any number of suppliers including Kerr McGee, Johnson Matthey, or Alpha Products of Davers, Massachusetts. '  Vanadium pentoxide has a CAS number of 1314-62-1. Iron oxide FejOa'-is a common and very inexpensive material available in powder form from the same suppliers.  The other precursor materials mentioned above are also available from well known suppliers, such as those listed above.<br><br><br>
The method of the invention may also be used to react starting materials in the presence of carbon to form a variety of other novel products ;• such as gamma-■ LiV2O5 and also to produce known products.  Here, the carbon functions to reduce metal ion of a starting metal compound to provide a product containing such reduced metal ion.  The method is particularly useful to also add lithium to the resultant product, which thus contains the .metallic element ions, namely, the lithium ion and the other metal ion, thereby forming a mixed'metal product. An example is the reaction of vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) with lithium carbonate in the presence of carbon to form gamma-LiV2O5.  Here the starting metal ion V^^V^^ is reduced to V^^V^^ in the final product.  A single phase gamma-LiV205 product ds not known to have been directly and independently formed before.<br>
As described earlier, it is desirable to conduct the reaction at a temperature where the lithium compound reacts before melting.  The temperature should be about 400°C or greater, and desirably 450°C or greater, and preferably 500°C or greater, and generally will proceed at a faster rate at higher temperatures. The various reactions involve production of CO or CO2 as an effluent gas.  The equilibrium at higher temperature favors CO formation.  Some of the reactions are more desirably conducted at temperatures greater than 600°C; most desirably greater than 650°C; preferably 700°C or greater; more preferably 750°C or' greater.  Suitable ■ ranges for many reactions are about 700 to 950°C, or about 700 to 800°C. .<br>
Generally, the higher temperature reactions produce CO effluent and the stoichiometry requires more<br><br><br>
carbon be used than the case where CO2 effluent is produced at lower temperature.  This is because the reducing effect of the C to CO2 reaction is greater than the C. to CO reaction.  The C to CO2 reaction involves an increase in carbon oxidation state of +4 (from 0 to 4) and the C to CO reaction involves an increase in carbon oxidation state of +2 (from ground state zero to 2). Here, higher temperature generally refers to a range of about 650°C to about 1000°C and lower temperature refers to up to about 650°C.  Temperatures higher than 1200°C are not thought to be needed.<br>
In one aspect, the method of the■invention utilizes the reducing capabilities of carbon in a unique and controlled manner to produce desired products having structure and lithium content suitable for electrode<br>
■■active materials.  The method of the invention makes it possible to produce products containing lithium, metal and oxygen in an economical and convenient process.  The ability to lithiate precursors, and change the oxidation state of a metal without causing abstraction of oxygen from a precursor is heretofore unexpected".  These advantages are at least in part achieved by the reductant, carbon, having an oxide whose free energy of formation becomes more negative as temperature increases. Such oxide of carbon is more stable at high temperature<br>
■ than at low temperature.  This feature is used to produce products having one or more metal ions- in a reduced oxidation state relative to the precursor metal ion oxidation state.  The method utilizes an effective combination of quantity of carbon, time and temperature to produce new products and to produce known products in a new way.<br><br>
Referring back to the discussion of temperature, at about VOCC both the carbon to carbon monoxide and the carbon to carbon dioxide reactions are occurring.  At closer to 600°C the C to CO2 reaction is the dominant reaction.' At closer to 800°C the C to CO reaction is dominant.  Since the reducing effect of the C to CO2 reaction is greater, the result is that less carbon is needed per atomic unit of metal to be reduced. In the case of carbon to carbon monoxide, each atomic unit of carbon is oxidized from ground'state zero to plus 2.  Thus, for each atomic unit of metal ion (M) which is being reduced by one oxidation state, one half atomic unit of carbon is required.  In the case of the carbon to carbon dioxide reaction, one quarter atomic unit of •' carbon is stoichiometrically required for each atomic unit of metal ion (M) which is reduced by one oxidation state, because carbon goes from ground state zero to a plus 4 oxidation, state.  These same relationships apply for each such metal ion being reduced and for each unit reduction in oxidation state desired.<br>
It is preferred to heat the starting materials at a ramp rate of a fraction of a degree to 10°C per minute and preferably about 2°C per minute.  Once the desired reaction temperature is attained, the reactants (starting materials) are held at the reaction temperature for several hours.  The heating is preferably conducted under non-oxidizing or inert gas such as argon or vacuum. Advantageously, a reducing atmosphere is not required, although it may be used if desired.  After reaction, the products- are preferably cooled from the elevated temperature to ambient (room) temperature (i.e., 10°C to 40°C).  Desirably, the cooling occurs at a rate siMIIar to the earlier ramp rate, and preferably 2°C/minute<br><br>
cooling.  Such cooling rate has been found to be adequate to achieve the desired structure of the final product. It is also possible to quench the products at a cooling rate on the order of about 100°C/minute.  In some instances, such rapid cooling (quench) may be preferred..<br>
The present invention resolves the capacity-problem posed by widely used cathode active material. It has been found that the capacity and capacity retention of cells having the preferred active material of the invention are improved over -conventional materials. Optimized cells containing lithium-mixed metal phosphates of the invention potentially have performance improved over commonly used lithium metal oxide compounds. 'Advantageously, the new method of making the novel, lithium-mixed metal phosphate compounds of the invention is. relatively economical and readily adaptable to commercial production.<br>
Objects, features, and advantages of the invention include an electrochemical cell or battery based on lithium-mixed metal phosphates.  Another object is to provide an electrode active material which combines the advantages of good discharge capacity and capacity retention.  It is also an object of the present invention to provide electrodes which can be manufactured economically.  Another object is to provide a method for forming electrode active material which lends itself to commercial scale production for preparation of large quantities.<br><br>
These and other objects, features, and advantages will become apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments, claims, and accompanying drawings.<br><br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodimen-fcs<br>
The present invention provides lithium-mixed metal-phosphates, which are usable as electrode active materials, for lithium (Li* ) ion removal and insertion. Upon extraction of the lithium ions from the lithium-mixed-metal-phosphates, significant capacity is achieved. In one aspect of the invention, electrochemical energy 'is provided when combined with a suitable counter electrode by extraction of a quantity x of lithium from lithium-mixed-metal-phosphates Lia.;KMIbMIIc(P04)ci.  When a quantity X of lithium is removed per formula unit of the lithium-mixed-metal phosphate,, metal MI is oxidized.  In another aspect, metal MII is also oxidized.  Therefore, at least one of MI and MII is oxidizable from its initial condition in the phosphate compound as Li is removed. . Consider the following which illustrate the mixed metal compounds of the invention: LiFei_ySnyP04, has two oxidizable elements, Fe and Sn; in contrast, LiF.ei_yMgyPO^ has one oxidizable metal, the metal Fe.<br>
In another aspect, the invention provides a lithium ion battery which comprises an electrolyte; a negative electrode having an insertion active material; and a positive electrode comprising'a lithium-mixed-metal-phosphate active material characterized by an ability to release lithium ions for insertion into the negative electrode active material.  The lithium-mixed-metal-phosphate is desirably represented by the nominal general formula LiaMIbMIIe(POJ j- .Although the metals MI and MII may be the same, it is preferred that the metals Ml'and MII are different.  Desirably, in the phosphate compound MI is a metal s-elected from the group: Fe, Co, Ni, Mn, Cu, V, Sn, Ti, Cr and mixtures thereof, and MI is<br><br>
most desirably a transition metal or mixture thereof selected from said group.  Most preferably, MI has a +2 valence or oxidation state.<br>
In' another aspect. MII is selected from Mg, Ca, Zn, Sr, Pb, Cd, Sn, Ba, Be, and mixtures thereof.  Most preferably, MII has a +2 valence or oxidation state.  The lithium-mixed-metal-phosphate is preferably a compound represented by the nominal general formula Lia.j5MIi,MIIc(P04);j, signifying the preferred composition and its capability to release x lithium.  Accordingly, during cycling, charge and discharge, the value of x varies as x greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to a.  The present invention resolves a capacity problem posed by conventional cathode active materials. Such problems with conventional active materials are described by Tarascon in U.S. Patent No. 5,425,932, using LiMngOi as an example.  SiMIIar problems are observed with LiCo02, LiNiOj, and -many, if not all, lithium metal chalcogenide materials.  The present invention demonstrates that significant capacity of the cathode active material is utilizable and maintained. .<br>
A preferred novel procedure for forming the lithium-raixed-metal-phosphate LiaMIbMIIc (PO,) ^ compound active material will now be described. In addition, the preferred novel procedure is also applicable to formation of other lithium metal compounds, and will be described as such.  The basic procedure will be described with reference to exemplary starting materials but is not limited thereby.  The basic process comprises conducting a reaction between a lithium compound, preferably lithium • carbonate (LiaCOs), metal compound(s), for example, vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) , iron oxide (Fe203) , and/or<br><br>
manganese hydroxide, and a phosphoric acid derivative, preferably the phosphoric acid ammonium salt, diammonium hydrogen phosphate,. (NHJ 2H (POJ .  Each of the precursor starting materials are available from a number of chemical outfits including Aldrich Chemical Company and Fluka. Using the method described herein,. LiFePO^ and LiFeo,9Mg0.1P04, Li3V2(P04)3 were prepared with approximately a stoichiometric amount of LijCOj, the respective metal compound, and (NH4)2HP04. Carbon powder was included with<br>
	these precursor materials.  The precursor materials were<br>
initially intimately mixed and dry ground for about 30<br>
minutes... The intimately mixed compounds were then<br>
pressed into pellets.  Reaction was conducted by heating<br>
in an oven at a preferred ramped heating, rate to an •' .<br>
elevated temperature, and held at such elevated<br>
temperature for several hours to complete formation of<br>
the reaction product. The entire reaction was conducted<br>
in a non-oxidizing atmosphere, under flowing pure argon<br>
gas.  The flow rate will depend upon the size of the oven<br>
and the quantity needed to maintain the atmosphere. The<br>
oven was permitted to cool down at the end of the<br>
reaction period, where cooling occurred at a desired rate<br>
under argon.  Exemplary and preferred ramp rates,<br>
elevated reaction temperatures and reaction times are<br>
described herein.' In one aspect, a ramp rate of<br>
2°/minute to an elevated temperature in a range of 750°C<br>
to 800°C was suitable along with a dwell (reaction time)<br>
of 8 hours.  Refe.r to Reactions 1, 2, 3 and 4 herein.  In<br>
another variation per Reaction 5, a reaction temperature<br>
of 600°C was used along with a dwell time of about one<br>
hour.  In still another variation, as per Reaction 6, 'a<br>
two-stage heating was conducted, first,to a temperature<br>
	of 300°C and then to a temperature of 850°.<br><br>
The general aspects of the above synthesis route are applicable to a variety of starting materials. .Lithium-containing compounds include LizO (lithium oxide), LiHjPO^ (lithium hydrogen phosphate), Li2C204 (lithium oxalate), LiOH (lithium hydroxide), LiOH.HjO (lithium hydroxide monohydride), and LiHCOg (lithium hydrogen carbonate). The metal compounds(s) are reduced in the presence of the reducing agent, carbon. The same considerations apply to other lithium-metal- and phosphate-containing precursors.  The thermodynamic considerations such as ease of reduction, of the selected precursors, the reaction kinetics, and the melting point of the salts will cause adjustment in the- general procedure, such as, amount of carbon reducing agent, and the temperature-of reaction.<br>
Figures 1 through 21 which will be described more particularly below show characterization data and capacity in actual use for the cathode materials (positive electrodes) of the invention.  Some,tests were conducted in a cell comprising a lithium metal counter electrode (negative electrode) and other tests were conducted in cells having a carbonaceous counter electrode.  All of the cells had an EC-.DMC-LiPFg electrolyte.<br>
Typical cell configurations will now be described with reference to Figures 22 and 23; arid such battery or cell utilizes the novel active material of the invention.  Note that the preferred cell arrangement described here is illustrative and the invention is not limited thereby. .Experiments are often performed, based on full and half cell arrangements, as per the following description.  For test purposes, test cells are often<br><br>
fabricated using lithium metal electrodes.  When forming cells for use as batteries, it is preferred to use an insertion positive electrode as per the invention and a graphitic carbon negative electrode.<br>
, A typical laminated battery cell structure 10 is depicted in Pignire 22.  It comprises a negative electrode-side 12, a positive electrode side 14, and an electrolyte/separator 16.there between.  Negative electrode side 12 includes current collector 1.8, and positive electrode side 14 includes current collector 22. A copper collector foil 18, preferably in the form of an open mesh grid, upon which is laid a negative electrode membrane '20 comprising an insertion material such as carbon or graphite or low-voltage lithium insertion compound, dispersed in a polymeric binder matrix.  An electrolyte/separator film 16 membrane is preferably a plasticized copolymer.  This electrolyte/separator preferably comprises a polymeric separator and a suitable electrolyte for' ion transport.  The electrolyte/separator is positioned upon the electrode element and is covered, with a positive electrode membrane 24 comprising a composition of a finely divided lithium insertion compound in a polymeric binder matrix.  An aluminum collector foil or grid 22 completes the assembly. Protective bagging material 40 covers the cell and prevents infiltration of air and moisture.<br>
In another embodiment, a multi-cell battery configuration as per Figure 23 is prepared with copper current collector 51, negative electrode 53, electrolyte/separator 55, positive electrode 57, and aluminum current collector 59.  Tabs 52 and 58 of the current collector elements form' respective terminals for<br><br>
the battery structure.  As used herein, the terms "cell" and "battery" refer to an individual cell comprising anode/electrolyte/cathode and also refer to a multi-cell arrangement in a stack.<br>
The relative weight proportions of the components of the positive electrode are generally:  50-■ 90% by weight active material; 5-30% carbon black as the electric conductive diluent; and 3-20% binder chosen to hold all particulate materials in contact with one another without degrading ionic conductivity.  Stated ranges are not critical, and the amount of active material in an electrode may range from 25-95 weight percent.  The negative electrode comprises about 50-95% by weight of a preferred graphite, with the balance constituted by the binder.  A typical electrolyte separator- film comprises approximately two parts polymer for every one part of a preferred fumed silica.  The conductive solvent comprises any number of suitable solvents and salts.  Desirable solvents .and salts are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,643,595 and 5,418,091. One example is a mixture of ECtDMCiLiPFg in a weight ratio of about 60:30:10.<br>
Solvents are selected to be used individually or in mixtures,,and include dimethyl carbonate (DMC), diethylcarbonate (DEC), dipropylcarbonate (DPC), ethylmethylcarbonate (EMC), ethylene- carbonate (EC), propylene carbonate (PC) , butylene carbonate, lactones, esters, glymes, sulfoxides, sulfolanes, etc.  The preferred solvents are EC/DMC, EC/DEC, EC/DPC and EC/EMC. The salt content ranges from 5% to 65% by weight,' preferably from 8% to 35% by weight.<br><br>
Those skilled in the art will understand'that any number of methods are used to form films from the casting solution using conventional meter bar or doctor blade' apparatus.  It is usually sufficient to air-dry the films at moderate temperature to yield self-supporting films of copolymer composition.  Lamination of assembled cell structures is accomplished by conventional means by pressing between metal plates at a temperature of about 120-160°C.  Subsequent to lamination, the battery cell material may be stored either with the retained plasticizer or as a dry sheet after extraction of the plasticizer with a selective low-boiling point solvent. The plasticizer extraction solvent is not critical, and methanol or ether are often used.<br>
Separator membrane element 16 is generally polymeric and prepared from a composition comprising, a copolymer.  A preferred composition is the 75 to 92% vinylidene fluoride with 8 to 25% hexafluoropropylene copolymer (available .commercially from Atochem North America as Kynar FLEX) and an organic solvent plasticizer..  Such a copolymer composition is also preferred for the preparation of the electrode membrane elements, since subsequent laminate interface compatibility is ensured.  The plasticizing solvent may be'one of the various organic compounds commonly used as solvents for electrolyte, salts, e.g.  propylene caxbonate or ethylene carbonate, as well as mixtures of these compounds.  Higher-boiling plasticizer compounds such as dibutyl phthalate, dimethyl phthalate, diethyl phthalate, and tris butoxyethyl phosphate are particularly suitable. Inorganic filler adjuncts, such as fumed alumina or  silanized fumed silica, may be used to enhance the physical strength and melt viscosity of a separator<br><br><br>
membrane and, in some compositions, to increase the subsequent level of electrolyte solution absorption.<br>
   In the construction of a lithium-ion battery, a current collector layer of aluminum foil or grid is overlaid with a positive electrode film, or,membrane, separately prepared as a coated layer of a dispersion of insertion electrode composition.  This is typically an insertion compound such as'LiMnjO^  (LMO') , LiCoOj, or LiNiOa, powder in a copolymer matrix solution, which is dried to form the positive electrode.  An electrolyte/separator membrane is formed as a dried coating of a composition comprising a solution containing  VdFrHFP- copolymer and a plasticizer solvent is then overlaid on the positive electrode film.  A negative electrode membrane formed as a dried coating of a powdered carbon or other negative electrode material dispersion in a VdF:HFP copolymer matrix solution is siMIIarly overlaid on the separator membrane layer.  A' copper current collector foil or grid is laid upon the negative electrode layer to complete the cell assembly. Therefore, the VdF:HFP copolymer composition is used as a binder in all of the major cell components, positive electrode film, negative electrode film, and electrolyte/separator membrane.  The assembled components are then heated under pressure to achieve heat-fusion bonding between the plasticized copolymer matrix .electrode and electrolyte components, and to the collector grids, to thereby form an effective laminate of cell elements.  This produces an essentially unitary and flexible battery cell structure.<br>
Examples of forming cells containing metallic lithium anode, insertion electrodes, solid electrolytes<br><br>
and liquid electrolytes can be found in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,668,595; 4,830,939; 4,935,317; 4,990,413; 4,792,504; 5,037,712; .5,262,253; 5,300,373; 5,435,054; 5,463,179; 5,399,447; 5,482,795. and 5,411,820; each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.  Note that the older generation of.cells contained organic polymeric and inorganic electrolyte matrix materials, with the polymeric being most preferred. . The polyethylene oxide of 5,411,82 0 is an example.  More modern examples are the VdF:HFP polymeric matrix. Examples of casting, lamination and formation of cells using VdFrHFP are as described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,418,091; 5,450,904; 5,456,000; and 5,540,741; assigned to Bell Communications Research, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
As described earlier, the electrochemical cell operated as per the invention, may be prepared in a variety of ways.  In one embodiment, the negative electrode may be metallic lithium. In more desirable embodiments, the negative electrode, is an insertion active material, such as, metal oxides and graphite. When a metal oxide active material is used, the components of the electrode are the metal oxide, electrically conductive carbon, and binder, .in proportions siMIIar to that described above for the positive electrode'. In a preferred embodiment, the negative electrode active material is graphite particles. For test purposes, test cells are often fabricated using-lithium metal electrodes.  When forming cells for use as batteries, it is preferred to use an" insertion metal oxide positive electrode and a graphitic carbon negative electrode.  Various methods for fabricating electrochemical cells and batteries and for forming<br><br>
electrode components are described herein.  The invention is'not, however, limited by any particular fabrication method.<br><br>

Referring to Figure 1,   the final product LiFePOi, prepared from Fe2O3 metal compound per Reaction 1(b),  appeared brown/black in color.  This olivine material product included' carbon that remained after reaction. Its CuKoi x-ray diffraction pattern contained all of the peaks expected for this-material as shown in Figure.1.  The pattern evident in Figure 1 is consistent with the single phase olivine phosphate, LiFePO^.  This<br>
 is evidenced by the position of the peaks in terms of the scattering angle-2 9 (theta), x axis. The x-ray pattern showed no peaks due to the presence of precursor oxides indicating that the solid state reaction is essentially<br>
. entirely completed.  Here the space group SG = pnma (62) and the lattice parameters from XRD refinement are consistent with the olivine structure.  The values are a = 10.2883A CO.0020), b = 5.9759 (0.0037), c = 4.6717A (0.0012) 0.0072, cell volume = 287.2264A^ (0.0685). Density,  p = 3.605 g/cc, zero = 0.452 (0.003)'.  Peak at full width half maximum, PFWHM = 0.21.  Crystallite size from XRD data = 704A.<br>
The x-ray pattern demonstrates that the product of.the invention was indeed the nominal formula LiFeP04. The term "nominal formula" refers to. the fact that the relative proportion of atomic species may vary slightly on the order of 2 percent to 5 percent, or more typically, 1 percent to 3 percent, and that some portion of P may be substituted by Si, S or As; and some portion of 0 may be substituted by halogen, preferably F.<br><br>
The LiFePO^, prepared as described immediately above, was tested in an electrochemical cell.  The positive electrode was prepared as described above, using IS.Omg of active material.  The positive electrode contained, on a weight % basis, 8 5% active material, 10% carbon- black, and 5% EPDM.  The negative electrode was metallic lithium.  The electrolyte was a 2:1 weight ratio mixture of ethylene carbonate and dimethyl carbonate within which was dissolved 1 molar LiPFg..  The cells'were cycled between about 2.5 and about 4.0 volts with performance as shown in Figures 2 and 3.'<br>
Figure 2 shows the results of the first constant current cycling at 0.2 MIIliamps per square centimeter between about 2.5 and 4.0 volts based upon about 19-MIIligrams of the LiFePO^ active material in the cathode (positive electrode)'.  In an as prepared, as assembled, initial condition, the positive electrode active material is LiFePO,.  The lithium is extracted from the LiFeP04 during -charging of the cell.  When fully charged, about 0.72^ unit of lithium had been removed per formula unit.  Consequently, the positive electrode active material corresponds to Lii_j:FeP04 where x appears to be equal to about 0.72, when the cathode material _is at 4.0 volts versus Li/Li*.  The extraction represents approximately 123 MIIliamp hours per gram corresponding to about' 2.3 MIIliamp hours based on 19 MIIligrams active material.  Next, the cell is discharged whereupon a quantity of 'lithium is re-inserted into the LiFePO^.  The re-insertion corresponds to approximately 121 MIIliamp hours per gram proportional to the insertion of essentially all of the lithium.  The bottom of the curve  -corresponds to approximately 2.5 volts.  The total<br><br>
cumulative capacity demonstrated during the entire extraction-insertion cycle is 244inAh/g.<br>
Figure 3 presents data obtained by multiple constant current cycling at 0.2 MIIliamp hours per square centimeter of the LiFeP04 versus lithium metal counter electrode between 2.5 and 4.0 volts.  Data is shown-for two temperatures, 23°C and 60°C.  Figure 3 shows the excellent rechargeability of the LiFePO^ cell,' and also shows good cycling and capacity of the cell. The performance shown after about 190 to 200 cycles is good and shows that electrode formulation is very desirable.<br>
Referring to Figure 4, there is shown data'for the final product LiFe0.9Mg0.1PO4, prepared from the metal compounds Fe203 and Mg(0H)2 -^ Mg(0H)2, per Reaction 2(b). Its CuKa x-ray diffraction pattern contained all of the peaks expected for this material as shown in Figure 4. The pattern evident in Figure 4 is consistent with the single phase olivine phosphate compound, LiFe0.9Mg0.1PO4. This .is evidenced by the position of the peaks in terms of the scattering angle 2 8 (theta), x axis. The x-ray pattern showed no peaks due to the presence of precursor oxides indicating that the solid state reaction is essentially entirely-completed.  Here the space group SG = Pnma (62) and the lattice parameters from XRD refinement are consistent with the olivine structure. The values are' a = 10.2688A (0.0069), b = 5.9709A (0.0072), c = 4.6762A (0.0054), cell volume = 286.7208A (0.04294), p = 3.617 g/cc, zero = 0.702 (0.003), PFWHM = 0.01, and crystallite = .950A.<br>
The x-ray pattern demonstrates that the product of the-invention was indeed the nominal formula<br><br>
LiFe^gMgciPO^. The term "nominal formula" refers to the fact that the relative proportion of atomic species may vary slightly on the order of 2 percent to 5 percent, or more typically, 1 percent to 3 percent, and that some ; substitution of P and 0 may be made while maintaining the basic olivine structure.<br>
The LiFe0.9Mg0.1P04_ prepared as described immediately above, was tested in an electrochemical cell. The positive electrode was prepared as described above, using 18.9mg.of active materials.  The positive electrode', negative electrode and electrolyte were prepared -as described earlier and in connection with Figure 1.  The cell was between about 2.5 and about -4.0 volts with performance as shown in Figures 4, 5 and 6.<br>
Figure 5 shows the results of the first constant current cycling at 0.2 MIIliamps per square centimeter between about 2.5 and 4.0 volts based upon about 18.9 MIIligrams of the LiFeo.sMg0.1PO4 active material in the cathode (positive electrode).  In an as prepared, as assembled, initial condition, the positive electrode active material is LiFe0.9Mg0.1PO^.  The lithium is extracted from the LiFeQ.gMg0.1PO^ during charging of the cell.  When fully charged, about 0.87 units of lithium have been removed per formula unit. Consequently, the positive electrode active material corresponds to Li1_j5Fe0.9MgD.1PO4 where x appears to be equal to about 0.87, when the cathode material is at 4.0 volts versus Li/Li"^.  The extraction represents approximately 150 MIIliamp hours per gram corresponding to about 2.8 MIIliamp hours based on 18.9 MIIligrams active material. Next, the cell is discharged whereupon a quantity of lithium is re-inserted into the LiFeo,9Mg0.1P04 .  The re-<br><br><br>
of the lithium.  The bottom of the curve corresponds to approximately 2.5 volts.  The total cumulative specific capacity over the entire cycle is 296. mAhr/g.  This material has a much better cycle profile than the-LiFeP04.  Figure 5 (LiFe0.9Mg0.1PO4) .shows a very well defined and sharp peak at about 150 mAh/g.  In contrast, Figure 2 (LiFePO^) shows a very shallow slope leading to the peak at about 123 mAh/g.  The Fe-phosphate (Figure 2) provides 123 mAh/g compared to its theoretical capacity of 170 mAh/g.  This ratio of 123/170, 72% is relatively ' poor compared to the Fe/Mg-phosphate.  The Fe/Mg-phosphate (Figure 5) provides 150 mAh/g compared to a theoretical capacity of 160, a ratio of 150/160 or 94%.<br>
Figure 6 presents data obtained by multiple constant current cycling at 0.2 MIIliamp hours per square centimeter of the LiFe0.9Mg0.1PO4 versus lithium metal counter electrode between 2.5 and 4.0 volts.  Figure S shows the excellent rechargeability of the Ll/LiFe0.9Mg0.1PO, cell, and also shows good cycling  and capacity of the cell. The performance shown after about 150 to 160 cycles is very good and shows that electrode formulation LiFeo,9Mg0.1P04 performed significantly better than the LiFePOi.' Comparing Figure 3 (LiFeP04)'to Figure 6 (LiFe0.9Mg0.1PO4) it can be seen that the Fe/Mg-phosphate maintains its capacity over prolonged cycling, whereas the- Fe-phosphate capacity fades significantly.<br>
Figure 7 shows, the results of the first constant current cycling at 0'. 2 MIIliamps per square centimeter between about 2.5 and 4.0 volts based upon about 16 MIIligrams of' the LiFe0.8Mg0.2PO4 active material<br><br>
- as assembled, initial condition, the positive electrode active material is LiFeo;8Mg0.2P04- The lithium is extracted from the LiFe0.8Mg0.2PO4 during charging of the cell.  When fully charged, about 0.7 9 units of lithium have been removed per formula unit.  Consequently, the positive electrode active material corresponds to LiFeo.BMg0.2PO4 where x appears to be equal to about 0.79, when the cathode material is at 4.0 volts versus Li/Li*. The extraction approximately 140 MIIliamp hours per gram corresponding-to about 2.2 MIIliamp hours based on 16 MIIligrams active material.  Next, the cell is discharged whereupon a quantity of lithium is re-inserted into the LiFe0.8Mg0.2PO4.  The re-insertion corresponds to approximately 122 MIIliamp hours per gram proportional to the insertion o.f essentially all of the lithium."  The<br>
 bottom of the curve corresponds to approximately 2.5 volts.  The total cumulative specific capacity over the entire cycle is 262 mAhr/g.<br>
Referring to Figure 8, there is shown data for the final product LiFe0.9Ca0.1PO4, prepared from FejOa and Ca(0H)2 by Reaction 3.  Its CuKa x-ray diffraction pattern contained all of the peaks. expected for this material as shown in Figure 8.  The pattern evident in Figure 8 is consistent with the single phase olivine phosphate . compound, LiFe0.9C.ao-.1PO4.  This is evidenced by the position of the peaks in terms of the scattering angle 2 9 (theta) , x axis. The x-ray pattern showed no-peaks due to the presence of precursor oxides indicating that the solid state reaction is essentially entirely completed.  Here the space group SG = Pnma ,(62) and the lattice parameters from XRD refinement are consistent with olivine.  The values are a = 10.3240A (0.0045), b =<br><br>
6.0042A (0.0031), c = 4.6887A (0.0020), cell volume^' 290.6370A (0.1807), zero =0.702 (0.003), p '= 3.62 g/cc, PFWHM = 0.18, and crystallite = 580A.  The x-ray pattern demonstrates that the product of the invention was indeed the nominal formula LiFe0.9Ca0.1PO4.<br>
Figure 9 shows the results of the first constant current cycling at 0.2 MIIliamps per square' centimeter between about 2.5 and 4.0 volts based upon about 18.5 MIIligrams of the'LiFeo.BCa0.2PO4 active-material in the cathode (positive electrode).  In an as prepared, as assembled,, initial condition, the positive electrode active material is LiFe0.8Ca0.2PO4.  The lithium is extracted from the LiFe0.3Ca0.2P04 during charging of the cell.  When fully charged, about 0.71 units of lithium have been removed per formula.unit. Consequently, the positive electrode active material corresponds to LiFeo,aCa0.2P04 where x appears to be equal<br>

MIIliamp hours based on 18.5 MIIligrams active material. -Next, the cell is discharged whereupon a quantity of lithium is re-inserted into the LiFe0.8Ca0.2P04.  The re¬insertion corresponds to approximately 110 MIIliamp hours per gram proportional to the insertion of nearly all of the lithium.  The bottom of the curve corresponds to approximately 2.5 volts.  The total specific cumulative capacity over the entire cycle is. 233 mAhr/g.<br>
Figure 10 shows the results of the first constant current cycling at 0.2 MIIliamps per square centimeter between about 2.5 and 4.0 volts based upon about 18.9 MIIligrams of the LiFe0.8Zn0.2P04 olivine active<br><br>

When fully charged,' about 0.7 4 units of lithium have been removed per formula unit.  Consequently, the positive electrode active material corresponds to Li^. j.FeO J 8ZnO .2P04 where x appears to be equal 'to about 0.74, when the cathode material is at 4.0 volts versus Li/Li*. The extraction represents approximately 124 MIIliamp hours per gram corresponding to' about 2.3 MIIliamp hours based on 18.9 MIIligrams active material.  Next, the cell is discharged whereupon a quantity of lithium is re-' inserted into the LiFeo.BZn0.2PO4.  The re-insertion corresponds to approximately .108 MIIliamp hours per gram proportional to the insertion of nearly all of the-lithium.  The bottom of the curve corresponds to approximately 2.5 volts.<br>
Referring to Figure 11, the final product LiVzOg, prepared'by Reaction 5, appeared black in color. Its CuKa x-ray diffraction pattern contained all of the peaks expected for this material as shown in Figxtre 11. The pattern evident in Figure 11 is consistent with a single oxide compound gamma-LiV2O5. This is evidenced by the position of the peaks in terms of the scattering  angle 2 6 (theta), x axis. The x-ray pattern showed no peaks due to the presence of precursor oxides indicating that the solid state reaction is essentially entirely completed.<br>
The x-ray pattern demonstrates that the"product of the invention was indeed the nominal formula gamma-<br><br>

The LiVsOs prepared as described immediately above, was tested in an electrochemical cell. The cell was prepared as described above and cycled with . performance as shown in Figures 12 and 13.<br>
Figure 12 shows the results of the first constant current cycling at 0.2 .MIIliamps per square centimeter betw.een about 2.8 and 3.8 volts based upon about 15.0 MIIligrams of the LiV2O5 active material in the cathode (positive electrode).

When fully charged, about 0.93 unit of lithium had been removed per formula unit.  Consequently, the positive electrode active material corresponds to Li1-xv2O5 where x'appears to be equal to about 0.93,, when the cathode material is at • 3.8 volts versus Li/Li*.  The extraction represents approximately 132 MIIliamp hours per gram corresponding to about 2.0 MIIliamp hours based on 15.0 MIIligrams active material.  Next, the cell is discharged whereupon a quantity of lithium is re-inserted into the LiVgOj.

The performance shown up to about 300 cycles is good.<br>
Referring to Figure 14, the final product LijVj (204)3, prepared by Reaction 6, appeared green/black in color.  Its CuKcx x-ray diffraction pattern contained all. of the peaks expected for this material as shown in Figure 14.  The pattern evident in Figure 14 is consistent with a single phosphate compound Li3V2(P04)3 of the monoclinic, Nasicon phase.  This is evidenced by the position of the peaks in terms of the scattering angle 2 6 (theta), x axis. The x-ray pattern showed no peaks due to the presence of precursor oxides' indicating that the solid state reaction is essentially entirely completed.<br>
The x-ray pattern-demonstrates that the product of the invention was indeed the nominal formula Li3V2(P04)3 . The term "nominal formula" refers to the fact that the relative proportion of atomic species may vary slightly on the order of 2 percent to 5 percent, or more typically, 1 percent to 3 percent; and that substitution of P and 0 may occur.<br>

The final product, prepared as per U.S. Patent No.. 5,871,866, appeared green in color.  Its CuKa x-ray diffraction pattern contained all of the peaks expected for this material' as shown in Figure 15.  The pattern evident in Figure 15 is consistent with a monoclinic Nasicon single phase phosphate compound Li3V2(P04)3.  This is evidenced by the position of the . peaks 'in terms of the' scattering angle 2 9 (theta) , x axis. The x-ray. pattern showed no peaks due to the presence of precursor oxides indicating that the solid state reaction is essentially entirely completed. Chemical analysis for lithium and vanadium by atomic absorption spectroscopy showed, on a percent by weight basis, 5.17 percent lithium and 26 percent vanadium. This is close to.the expected result of 5.11 percent lithium and 25 percent vanadium.<br>

Barker in Synth, Met . 28, D217 (1989); Synth.-Met. 32, 43 (1989); J. Power Sources, 52, 185 (1994); and Electrochemica Acta, Vol. 40, No. 11, at 1603 (1995) .  Figure 16 clearly shows and highlights the reversibility of the product. The .positive electrode contained about 13.8 MIIligrams of the Li3V2(P04)3 -active material.  The positive electrode showed a performance of about 133 MIIliamp hours per gram on the first discharge.  In Figure 16, the capacity in, and the capacity out are essentially the same, resulting in essentially no capacity loss.  Figure 17 is an EVS differential capacity plot based on Figure 16.  As can be seen from Figure 17, the relatively symmetrical nature of peaks indicates good electrical reversibility, there are small peak separations (charge/discharge), and good • correspondence between peaks above and below the zero axis.  There are essentially no peaks that can be related' to irreversible reactions, since all peaks above the axis (cell charge) have, corresponding peaks below the axis (cell discharge),■ and there is essentially no separation between the peaks above and below the axis.  This shows that the carbothermal method of the invention produces high quality electrode, material.<br>
Figure 18 presents data obtained by multiple constant current cycling at 0.2 MIIliamp hours per square centimeter of the LiFe0.8Mg0.2PO4 versus lithium metal counter electrode between 2.5 and 4.0 volts.  Figure 18<br><br>
shows the excellent rechargeability of the Li/LiFe0.8Mg0.2PO^ cell, and also shows good cycling and capacity of the cell.  The performance shown after about 110 .to 120 cycles at 23°C is very good and shows that electrode formulation LiFe0.8Mg0.2PO4 performed significantly better than the LiFeP04.  The cell cycling test at 60°C  was started after the 23'C test and was ongoing.  Comparing Figure 3 (LiFeP04) to Figure 18 (LiFe0.8Mg0.2PO4) , it can be seen that the Fe/Mg-phosphate-maintains its capacity over prolonged cycling, whereas the Fe-phosphate capacity fades significantly.<br>
In addition to the above cell tests, the active materials of the invention were also cycled against ■ insertion anodes in non-metallic, lithium ion, rocking chair cells.<br>
The lithium mixed metal phosphate,and the, lithium metal oxide were used to formulate a cathode electrode.  The electrode was fabricated, by solvent casting a slurry of the treated, enriched lithium manganese oxide,'conductive carbon, binder, plasticizer and.solvent.  The conductive carbon used was Super P (MMM Carbon).  Kynar Flex 2801® was used as the binder and electronic grade acetone was used as a solvent.  The preferred plasticizer was dibutyl phthal-ate (DPB) .  The slurry was cast onto glass and a free-standing electrode was formed as the solvent was evaporated.  In this example, the cathode had 23.1mg LiFe0.9Mg0.1PO4 active material. . Thus, the proportions.are as follows on a percent weight basis: 80% active material; 8% Super P . carbon; and 12% Kynar binder.<br><br>
A graphite counter electrode was prepared for use with the aforesaid cathode.  The graphite counter electrode served as the anode in the electrochemical cell.  The anode had 10.8 mg of the MCMB graphite active material.  The graphite electrode was fabricated by solvent casting a slurry of MCMB2528 graphite, binder, and casting solvent.  MCMB252.8 is a mesocarbon microbead material supplied by Alumina Trading, which is the U.S. distributor for the supplier, Osaka Gas Company of Japan. 'This material.has a density of about 2.24 grams per cubic centimeter; a particle size maximum for at least 95% by weight of the particles of 37 microns; median size of about 22.5 microns and an interlayer distance of about 0.336.  As in the case of the cathode, the binder was a copolymer of polyvinylidene difluoride (PVdF) and hescafluoropropylene (HFP) in a wt. ratio of PVdF to HFP of 88:12.  This binder is sold'under the designation of Kynar Flex 2801®, showing it's a registered trademark. Kynar Flex is available from Atochem Corporation.  An electronic grade solvent was used.  The slurry was cast   onto glass and a free standing electrode was formed as the casting solvent evaporated.  The electrode composition was approximately as follows on a dry weight basis: 85% graphite; 12% binder; and 3% conductive ■carbon.<br>
A rocking chair battery was prepared comprising the anode, the cathode, and an electrolyte.  The ratio of the active cathode mass to the active anode mass was about 2.14:1.  The two electrode layers were arranged with an electrolyte layer in between, and the layers were laminated together using heat and- pressure as per the Bell Coram. Res. patents incorporated herein by reference .earlier.  In a preferred method, the cell is activated<br>
^7<br><br>
with EC/DMC solvent in a weight ratio of 2:1 in a solution containing 1 M LiPFg salt.<br>
Figures 19 and 20 show data for the first four complete .cycles of the lithium ion cell having the LiFe0.9Mg0.1PO4 cathode, and the MCMB2528 anode.  The cell' comprised 23.1mg active LiFe0.9Mg0.1POi and 10.8itig active MCMB2528 for a cathode to anode mass ratio of 2.14.  The cell Was charged and discharged at 23°C at an approximate C/10 (10 hour) rate between voltage limits of 2.50 V and 3.60 V.  The voltage profile plot (Figure 19) shows the variation in cell voltage versus time for the LiFe0.9Mg0.1PO4/MCMB2528 lithium ion cell.  The. symmetrical nature of the charge-discharge is clearly evident. .The small degree of voltage hysteresis between the charge and .discharge processes is evidence for the low overvoltage in the system, which is very good.  Figure 20 shows the variation of LiFe0.9Mg0.1PO4 specific capacity with cycle ■ number.  Clearly, over the cycles shown, the material demonstrates good cycling stability.<br>
Figure 21 shows data for the first three complete cycles of the lithium ion cell having the gamma-LiV2O5 cathode and the MCMB252B anode.- The cell prepared was a rocking chair, lithium ion cell as described above. The cell comprised 29.1mg gamma-LiV2O5 cathode active material and '12.2mg MCMB252 8 anode active material, for a cathode to anode maas ratio of 2.39.  As stated earlier, the liquid electrolyte used was EC/DMC {2:1) and IM LiPFg.  The cell was charged and discharged at 23°C at an approximate C/10 (10 hour) rate, between voltage limits of ,2.50 V and 3.65 V.  The voltage profile plot (Figure 21.) shows the variation in cell voltage versus time for the LiV205/MCMB2 528 lithium ion cell.' The symmetrical nature<br><br>
of the charge-discharge is clearly evident.  The small degree of voltage hysteresis between the charge and-discharge processes is evidence for the low overvoltage in the system, which is very good.<br>
In summary, the invention provides new compounds LiaMIbMIIc(PO4)d, and gamma-LiV2O5 by new methods which are adaptable to commercial, scale production.  The LiiMIi.yMIIyPOi compounds are isostructural olivine compounds as demonstrated by XRD analysis.  Substituted compounds, such as LiFe1-yMgyPO4 show better performance than LiFePO^ unsubstituted compounds when used as electrode active materials.  The method of the invention utilizes the reducing capabilities of carbon along with selected precursors and reaction conditions to produce high quality products suitable as electrode active mateirials or as ion conductors.  The reduction capability of carbon over a broad temperature range is selectively applied along with thermodynamic and kinetic considerations to provide an energy-efficient, economical and convenient process to produce compounds of a desired composition and structure.  This is in contrast to known methods.<br>
Principles of carb'othermal reduction have been applied to produce pure metal from metal oxides by removal of oxygen.  See, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. • 2,'580,878, 2v570,232, 4,177,060, and 5, 803, 974.<br>
 Principles of carbothermal and thermal reduction have also been used to form carbides.  See, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 3,865,745 and 5,384,291/ and non-oxide ceramics (see U.S. Patent No. 5,607,297). Such methods are not known to have been applied to form lithiated.<br>
. products or to form products without oxygen abstraction<br><br>
from the precursor. The methods described with respect to the present invention provide high quality products which are- prepared from precursors Which are lithiated during the reaction without oxygen abstraction.  This is a surprising result.  The new methods of the invention also provide new compounds not' known to have been made before.<br>
For example, alpha-V2O5 is conventionally lithiated electrochemically against metallic lithiuml Thus, alpha-V2O5 is not suitable as a source of lithium for a cell.  As a result, alpha-V2O5 is not used in an¬ion cell.  In the present invention, alpha-V2O5 is lithiated by carbothermal reduction using a simple lithium-containing compound and the reducing capability of carbon to form a gamma-LiV205.  The single phase compound, gamma-LiV2O5 is not known to have been directly , and independently prepared before.  There is not known to be a direct synthesis route.  Attempts to form it as a single phase resulted in a mixed phase product containing one or more beta phases and having the formula LiV2O5 with 0 
<br><br>
vanaaium is reaucea rrom v- ro v^.  isee Keacnon oj. The new product, gamma-LiV205 is air-stable and suitable as an electrode material for an ion cell or rocking chair battery.<br>
The convenience and energy efficiency of the • present process can -also be contrasted to known methods for forming products under reducing atmosphere such as H2 which is difficult to control, and from complex and expensive precursors.  In the present invention, carbon is the reducing agent, and simple, inexpensive and even naturally occurring precursors are.useable.. For example, it is possible to produce LiFeP04 from FejOj, a simple common oxide.  (See Reaction lb).  The production of LiFePO^ provides a good example of the thermodynamic and kinetic features of the method.  Iron phosphate is reduced by carbon and lithiated over a broad temperature range.  At about 600°C, the C to CO2 reaction predominates'and takes about a week to complete.  At about 750°C, the C to CO reaction predominates and takes about 8 hours to complete.  The C to COg reaction requires less carbon reductant but takes longer due to the low temperature kinetics. .The C to CO reaction requires about twice as much carbon, but due to the high temperature reaction kinetics, it proceeds relatively fast.  In both cases,, the- Fe in the precursor Fe203 has oxidation state +3 and is reduced to oxidation (valence) state +2 in the product LiFePO^.  The C to CO reaction requires that H  atomic unit of carbon be used for each atomic unit of Fereduced by one valence state.  The CO to CO2 reaction requires that 1/4 atomic unit of carbon be used for each atomic unit of Fe reduced by one valence state.<br><br>
The active materials of the invention are also characterized by being stable in an as-prepared condition, in the presence of air and particularly humid air.  This is a striking advantage, because it facilitates preparation of and assembly of battery cathodes and cells, without the requirement for controlled atmosphere.  This feature is particularly important, as those skilled in the art will recognize that air stability, that is, lack of degradation on exposure to air, is very important for commercial processing.  Air-stability is known in the art to more specifically indicate that a material does not hydrolyze in pre-sence of moist air.  Generally, air-stable materials are also characterized by Li being extracted therefrom above about 3.0 volts versus lithium.  The higher the extraction potential, the more tightly bound the lithium ions are to the host- lattice.  This tightly bound property generally confers air stability on the material.  The air-stability of the materials of the invention is consistent with the stability demonstrated by cycling at the conditions stated herein.  This is in contrast .to materials which insert Li at lower voltages, below about- 3.0 volts versus lithium, and which are not air-stable, and which hydrolyze in moist air.<br>
