				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a communication technology field, and particularly to a<br>
method, device and system for identifying a service.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
In the communication technology field, a user needs to contact a service provider when<br>
initiating a service request. When the service request meets conditions, the service provider<br>
provides services in response to the service request. For example, in data services, the user<br>
may initiate a service request for a multimedia messaging service (MMS) via a terminal such<br>
as a cell phone. In order to contact the service provider, an IP address and a port of a wireless<br>
application protocol gateway (WAP GW) as well as an access point name (APN) need to be<br>
configured in the cell phone. The address of a service gateway should also be configured<br>
correctly at the same time. When all these parameters are configured correctly, the object of<br>
the service request may be realized.<br>
The inventor of the present invention found in the process of studying and practicing the<br>
above prior art that the system may typically take the address and the port of the WAP GW as<br>
default and the APN may be identified automatically, but the service request can not be<br>
realized correctly when the address of the service gateway is configured wrongly. This means<br>
that the prior art has the following disadvantages: Correct configuration of the address of the<br>
service gateway becomes a prerequisite for transmitting multimedia messages correctly and<br>
the service of transmitting multimedia messages can not be achieved when the address of the<br>
service gateway is configured wrongly in the terminal.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
The present invention provides a method, device and system for identifying a service<br>
which enables a service request to be identified correctly and hence transmitting the<br>
multimedia messaging service correctly even when a terminal is configured wrongly.<br>
An embodiment of the present invention provides a method for identifying a service<br>
which includes: receiving a service request including a field for indicating a service content<br>
type of the service request, and resolving the service request to identify a service type of the<br>
service request according to the field included in the service request.<br>
An embodiment of the present invention also provides an application protocol gateway<br>
including: a receiving unit configured to receive a service request including a field for<br>
indicating a service content type of the service request, and a resolving unit configured to<br>
resolve the field included in the service request to identify a service type of the service<br>
request.<br>
An embodiment of the present invention also provides a service processing system<br>
including: an application protocol gateway configured to receive a service request including a<br>
field for indicating a service content type of the service request transmitted by a terminal,<br>
resolve the service request to identify a service type of the service request according to the<br>
field and process service procedure according to the identified service type; and an<br>
application server configured to receive an inquiry request from the application protocol<br>
gateway and inquire an address of a service server corresponding to the identified service<br>
type.<br>
With the technical solutions described in embodiments of the present invention, a<br>
service content type for indicating a service type of the service request is included in the<br>
service request. When the service gateway is configured wrongly in the terminal, the service<br>
type of the service request may also be determined according to the service content type,<br>
thereby realizing service normally. For example, after receiving a service request, if the<br>
service gateway address is configured by the terminal wrongly, the service request is<br>
determined according to the service content type and corresponding service flow is carried<br>
out. For example, when it is the MMS service, the service request is processed according to<br>
the MMS service flow, therefore realizing MMS service and providing better insurance for<br>
realizing service successfully.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Technical solutions of the present invention will be described further with reference to<br>
embodiments below.<br>
For convenience of description, definitions and functions of messages involved in<br>
embodiments of the present invention is described briefly here. What described here are only<br>
general meanings and common standard specifications should be referred for improper<br>
description here. The description here is not intended to limit the invention.<br>
The following are definitions and functions of messages involved in embodiments of the<br>
present invention:<br>
M-Send.req, a message submitted to a multimedia message service center (MMSC) by a<br>
sender terminal via a WAP GW;<br>
M-Send.conf, a response message returned to the sender terminal by the MMSC after<br>
receiving the message submitted by the sender terminal;<br>
M-Notification.ind, a push notification message for notifying a receiver terminal to get a<br>
message from the MMSC, which is transmitted to the receiver terminal by the MMSC after<br>
receiving the multimedia message submitted by the sender terminal;<br>
M-NotifyResp.ind, a message for indicating whether the multimedia message is received<br>
successfully, which is sent to the MMSC by the receiver terminal;<br>
MGETREQ, transmitted by the receiver terminal to the MMSC, which instructs to<br>
retrieve the multimedia message;<br>
M-Retrieve.req, transmitted by the receiver terminal to the MMSC, which instructs to<br>
request to retrieve the multimedia message;<br>
M-Retrieve.conf, a response message returned by the MMSC after receiving the GET<br>
message from the receiver terminal; and<br>
<br>
M-Acknowledge.ind, a message for indicating reception status, which is transmitted to<br>
the WAP GW by the receiver terminal after completing reception of multimedia message.<br>
An embodiment of the present invention is described as follows.<br>
The multimedia message is a message that includes text, picture, video and audio<br>
contents, which is an enhancement of a short message service. If a user wants to use the<br>
MMS, he/she needs to configure an IP address and a port of the WAP GW and the APN on<br>
the cell phone terminal, and meanwhile configuring the address of the service gateway<br>
correctly is needed. After all the three parameters are configured correctly, the multimedia<br>
message can be transmitted correctly. A typical service gateway is for example the MMSC. If<br>
an operator deploys a plurality of MMSCs, the MMSCs are interconnected. When a user<br>
transmits an MMS message, a home MMSC is typically used for providing service. In this<br>
time, the WAP GW is needed to forward the service request to the home MMSC of the user.<br>
In order to realize the forwarding by the WAP GW, it needs to inquire an electronic numbers<br>
to uniform resource identifier (URI) mapping (ENUM) server to acquire the home MMSC of<br>
the user according to the address of the MMSC reported by a terminal of the user. For<br>
convenience of description, the electronic number to uniform resource identifier mapping<br>
server is referred to as an ENUM server. An example procedure may be described as follows:<br>
a user may be roamed from home province B to province A and transmits a service request<br>
for accessing an MMS from a visited (namely roamed)WAP GW ; the visited WAP GW may<br>
receive the service request for accessing an MMS transmitted by the user, and inquire the<br>
ENUM server to acquire the uniform resource locator (URL) address of the home MMSC of<br>
the user (hereinafter referred to as a URL address); the visited WAP GW may transmit<br>
directly the service request for accessing an MMS to the home MMSC of the user; and, the<br>
home MMSC of the user may return an MMS message transmission response.<br>
As shown in the system architecture of Fig. 1 and the signaling flow chart based on Fig.<br>
1 of Fig. 2, the embodiment is further described in detail below.<br>
S1: A terminal 100 may transmit an M-Send.req request message to a WAP GW 500 by<br>
taking a WAP as a carrying protocol. The terminal 100 is referred to as a sender terminal that<br>
is configured with the address of an MMSC.<br>
S2: The WAP GW 500 may receive the request message from the terminal 100 and<br>
resolves the URL address included in the service request. If the address is<br>
http://mmsc.monternet.com, it is regarded that the service request is a multimedia messaging<br>
service request, and the user identification of the sender is obtained from the service request<br>
<br>
and an inquiry that the address of the home MMSC of the sender  is retrieved from the<br>
ENUM server 300 is initiated.<br>
S3: The ENUM server 300 may return to the WAP GW 500 an inquiry result including<br>
the address of the home MMSC of the sender.<br>
S4: According to the response message, the WAP GW 500 may forward the<br>
M-Send.Req request message to the home MMSC 400 of the sender, to request to transmit<br>
the multimedia message.<br>
S5: The home MMSC 400 of the sender may respond to the request message of the<br>
WAP GW 500 and incorporate an M-Send.conf in the response to indicate that the request<br>
has been accepted.<br>
S6: The WAP GW 500 may forward the M-Send.conf to the terminal 100.<br>
In the above-mentioned embodiment, in order to transmit the multimedia message, it is<br>
needed to configure correctly the address "http://mmsc.monternet.com" of the MMSC in the<br>
terminal (referring to the step S2 in the above-mentioned embodiment). If the address is<br>
configured wrongly as for example "http://mms.monternet.com", the WAP GW will identify<br>
wrongly and fail to process the request as the MMS, hence leading failure of transmission of<br>
the multimedia message. This may bring poor experience for users and is adverse for the<br>
operator to actively promote services.<br>
The processing procedure for a person information management (PIM) service is the<br>
same with the above embodiment of transmitting multimedia messages. The PIM service may<br>
be mainly for synchronization of data such as a telephone directory, a scheduling table and an<br>
album between a cell phone terminal and the PIM server. For example, with synchronization<br>
operation on the telephone directory, a user may synchronize phone numbers on the terminal<br>
of the user to the PIM server.<br>
The processing procedure for the PIM service is similar to that of the MMS service. The<br>
WAP GW may receive the request message from the terminal and resolve the URL address<br>
included in the service request. If it is determined that the service to be executed is the PIM<br>
service, the ENUM server is inquired to acquire the address of the home PIM server of the<br>
user and the service request is forwarded to the home PIM server of the user by the WAP<br>
GW. However, if the terminal is configured with a wrong URL address, the WAP GW will<br>
identify wrongly and fail to process the service request as the PIM service. Thus the purpose<br>
of the service request can not be realized, which brings poor experience to users and is<br>
adverse for the carrier to actively promote services.<br>
<br>
An embodiment of the present invention provides a technical solution in which the WAP<br>
GW may respond normally to a service request, identify a service correctly and implement<br>
service process according to the service request even when the terminal is configured with the<br>
wrong address of the service gateway. For example, a service content type included in the<br>
service request may be also incorporated as one of identifying features for the WAP GW, so<br>
that the WAP GW may identify the service request not only according to the URL address of<br>
the service request but also according to the type of service contents included in the service<br>
request such as content information included in the Content-Type field of the service request.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, an embodiment of the present invention provides a method for<br>
identifying services, and the method may include the following steps.<br>
S11: A service request including a URL address is received;<br>
S22: Whether the URL address matches a service flow is determined.<br>
S33: A service type of the service request is identified according to a service content<br>
type included in the service request, when the determination result indicates that the URL<br>
address matches no service flow.<br>
For example, a visited application protocol gateway (typically a WAP GW) may receive<br>
the service request of a roaming user and determine whether the URL address included in the<br>
service request is the URL address of an MMSC. If the URL address included in the service<br>
request is the URL address of the MMSC, the process proceeds to the process procedure of<br>
prior art. If the URL address included in the service request is not the URL address of the<br>
MMSC, the service type of the service request is identified according to the service content<br>
type included in the service request.<br>
S44: A request for inquiring the address of the service server corresponding to the<br>
identified service type is transmitted after the service type of the service request is identified.<br>
For example, when the identified service type is the service request for the multimedia<br>
message, a request for inquiring the address of the home MMSC of the sender of the service<br>
request is transmitted.<br>
The above-mentioned step that whether the URL address matches a service flow is<br>
determined may further include the following steps: whether the URL address is the URL<br>
address of the MMSC or the address of the home PIM server of the user is determined; If the<br>
URL address is the URL address of the MMSC, the process proceeds to the MMS service<br>
procedure; and If the URL address is the address of the home PIM server of the user, the<br>
process proceeds to the PIM service procedure.<br>
<br>
In the above-mentioned embodiment, the type of service content included in the service<br>
request may be information included in a field of the service request and the field may be for<br>
example the Content-Type field.<br>
Referring to Fig. 4, the present embodiment may be described further as follows.<br>
S201: The service request from the roaming user is received by the visited WAP GW.<br>
S202: The URL address included in the service request is resolved.<br>
S203: Whether the URL address is the URL address of the MMSC such as<br>
"http://mmsc.monterne1.com" is determined.<br>
S204: Whether the service request is the MMS is identified continually according to the<br>
service content type included in the service request. The included service content type is for<br>
example the content in the Content-Type field. If the content is the service content type of the<br>
MMS, for example, the content is "Application/vnd.wap. mms-message", it is determined that<br>
the service request is an MMS request.<br>
In addition, a determination feature may be further added, and the following is an<br>
example.<br>
S205: It is needed that the MMS service request is a request for transmitting MMS<br>
service and the content information type of the Content-Type field is the MMS. For example,<br>
if a content of a method field in the service request is "m-send-req", it is determined that the<br>
service request is the MMS service request.<br>
A determination step may also be added in an embodiment of the present invention. For<br>
example, the request for inquiring the address of the home MMSC of the user is transmitted<br>
to the ENUM server when the service route table is matched successfully according to<br>
multipurpose internet mail extensions (MIME).An MIME message may include text, image,<br>
voice, video and data specific to other application programs.<br>
S206: The request for inquiring the address of the home MMSC of the user is<br>
transmitted to the ENUM server if the WAP GW determines that the service request<br>
satisfying the above-mentioned conditions is the MMS service request.<br>
With the technical solution described in the above-mentioned embodiments, it is realized<br>
that the WAP GW can determine and identify correctly the service type by the service<br>
content type and carry out subsequent steps for implementing the MMS even when the<br>
address of the service gateway is configured wrongly in the terminal. Thus the user's service<br>
request is correctly realized, the user's experience is satisfied well, which is equivalent to<br>
enhancing the fault tolerant processing capacity of the WAP GW and is advantageous for the<br>
<br>
operator's service promotion.<br>
Similarly, in the data services, particularly in the message services, the Content-type<br>
field in the service request may be extended to facilitate the WAP GW to correctly identify<br>
the service type corresponding to the service request. Again, the PIM service is taken as an<br>
example below.<br>
The visited WAP GW may resolve the URL address included in the service request after<br>
receiving the service request from the roaming user.<br>
Whether the URL address is the URL address of the PIM service is determined. If it is<br>
determined that the URL address is not the URL address of the PIM service, whether the<br>
service request is the PIM service is identified according to the service content type included<br>
in the service request. The included service content type may be for example the content in<br>
the included Content-Type field. If the content is the content type of the PIM service, it is<br>
determined that the service request is the PIM service request. Subsequent processing steps<br>
are carried out according to the prior art PIM service procedure.<br>
An embodiment of the present invention may also provide a application protocol<br>
gateway such as a WAP GW. Referring to Fig. 5, the WAP GW 500 includes a receiving unit<br>
501, a determining unit 502, and a resolving unit 503.<br>
The receiving unit 501 is configured to receive a service request including a URL<br>
address.<br>
The determining unit 502 is configured to determine whether the URL address matches<br>
a service flow.<br>
The resolving unit 503 is configured to resolve the service content type included in the<br>
service request to identify the service type of the service request when the determination<br>
result of the determining unit 502 indicates that the URL address matches no service flow.<br>
The determining unit 502 may determine whether the URL address matches a service<br>
flow. Further, the determining unit 502 may determine whether the URL address included in<br>
the service request is the URL address of the MMSC or the address of the home PIM server<br>
of the user.<br>
The resolution result of the resolving unit 503 may include the service content type to<br>
which the service request belongs, for example the MMS service or the PIM service.<br>
The WAP GW 500 may further include a transmitting unit 504 configured to transmit a<br>
request for inquiring the address of the service server corresponding to the identified service<br>
type. For example, when the resolution result is the MMS service, the transmitting unit 504<br>
<br>
may transmit to the ENUM server 300 a request for inquiring the address of the home MMSC<br>
of the user.<br>
The WAP GW 500 in the procedure of processing the service request may be described<br>
as follows.<br>
The WAP GW 500 may typically be the visited WAP GW . After the receiving unit 501<br>
receives from a roaming user a service request including generally a URL address, the<br>
resolving unit 503 may resolve the service content type included in the service request.<br>
Before the resolving of the resolving unit 503, the determining unit 502 may determine<br>
whether the URL address included in the service request is the URL address of the MMSC<br>
such as "http://mmsc.monternet.com". If it is determined that the URL address included in<br>
the service request is not the URL address of the MMSC, the resolving unit may resolve the<br>
service content type included in the service request, and the service type of the service<br>
request is identified according to the resolution result (namely the service content type). If it<br>
is identified that the service type of the service request is the MMS service, it may also be<br>
further determined that the service request is a request for transmitting the MMS service.<br>
After that, a request for inquiring the address of the home MMSC of the user is transmitted to<br>
the ENUM server 300. Subsequent steps proceed to the prior art procedure and are not<br>
described further here.<br>
With the technical solution described in the above-mentioned embodiments, the fault<br>
toleration capability of the WAP GW may be enhanced. The addition of determination<br>
feature may increase probability of identifying the service type correctly and better ensure<br>
normal operation of the service. And it is easier to implement with lower cost.<br>
An embodiment of the present invention may also provide a service processing system<br>
including a terminal, an application protocol gateway and an application server.<br>
The terminal is configured to transmit a service request including a field identifying the<br>
service content type of the service request.<br>
The application protocol gateway may be for example the WAP GW 500 shown in Fig.<br>
5 and is configured to resolve the service request transmitted by the terminal, identify the<br>
service type of the service request according to the field of the service content type and<br>
process service procedure according to the identified service type.<br>
The application server may be for example the ENUM server 300 shown in Fig. 5 and is<br>
configured to receive the inquiry request from the application protocol gateway and inquire<br>
the address of the service server corresponding to the identified service type. The inquiring<br>
<br>
the address of the service server corresponding to the identified service type is further<br>
described as follows: Referring to Fig. 5, for example, when the service type identified by the<br>
WAP GW 500 is the MMS service, the ENUM server 300 may receive from the WAP GW<br>
500 the request for inquiring the address of the home MMSC of the user and return to the<br>
WAP GW 500 an inquiry result including the address of the home MMSC of the user. Here,<br>
the server corresponding to the MMS service is the home MMSC of the user. For example<br>
again, when the service type identified by the WAP GW 500 is the PIM service, the ENUM<br>
server 300 is inquired to acquire the address of the home PIM server of the user, and the<br>
WAP GW 500 may forward the service request to the home PIM server of the user. Here, the<br>
service server corresponding to PIM service is the PIM server.<br>
Referring to Fig. 5, the WAP GW 500 may further include a receiving unit 501, a<br>
determining unit 502 and a resolving unit 503.<br>
The receiving unit 501 is configured to receive a service request including a URL<br>
address.<br>
The determining unit 502 is configured to determine whether the URL address matches<br>
a service flow.<br>
The resolving unit 503 is configured to resolve the service content type included in the<br>
service request and identify the service type of the service request when the determination<br>
result of the determining unit 502 indicates that the URL address matches no service flow.<br>
The determining unit 502 may determine whether the URL address matches a service<br>
flow. Further, the determining unit 502 may determine whether the URL address included in<br>
the service request is the URL address of the MMSC or the address of the home PIM server<br>
of the user.<br>
The resolution result of the resolving unit 503 may include the service content type to<br>
which the service request belongs, for example the MMS service or the PIM service.<br>
The WAP GW 500 may further include a transmitting unit 504 configured to transmit a<br>
request for inquiring the address of the service server corresponding to the identified service<br>
type. For example, when the resolution result is the MMS service, the transmitting unit 504<br>
may transmit to the ENUM server 300 a request for inquiring the address of the home MMSC<br>
