				<td>Regulator feeding control with two flow rate laws<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates in general to fuel injection systems in turbomachines and more particularly to a hydromechanical regulator of the force-balance type with hydraulic nozzle/flap control.<br>
Prior art<br>
A conventional hydromechanical regulator of the aforementioned type intended for a fuel injection system in a turbomachine is illustrated schematically in Figure 9. It is organized around a fuel feed unit 10, the inlet duct 12a of which is connected to a high-pressure pump 14 and the outlet duct 12b is connected to a plurality of fuel injectors for a combustion chamber of the turbomachine 16, the flow of fuel of which, that has to flow into the injectors from the high-pressure pump, is controlled by a force balance (or tachometric balance 20) .<br>
The balance, which can move about a pivot pin 22 passing through a sealed partition, conventionally comprises a beam having two arms 24, 26 which, in the steady state, is in balance under the action of the three forces that are applied to it (see Figure 10) . A first force F1 (acting downwards in the figure) is applied, at a distance Lf from the pivot pin, to a fixed point on its first arm 24 by the rod 18 of the fuel feed unit via a first elastic member 28 of the compressed spring type; a second force F2, which opposes the first, is applied by a nozzle 30 which injects, against the first lever arm (forming a flap), at a fixed point a distance Ln from the pivot pin, a pressurized jet of fuel; and a third force F3 (which is also downward in the figure) is applied, at a distance Lb from the pivot pin, at a fixed point on its second arm 26. The latter downward force results from the application of a pressure differential (3P3 - Pi on an<br><br>
air bellows 32, P3 being the pressure on the output side of the high-pressure compressor (not shown) of the turbomachine, (3 being a multiplicative factor that depends on the operating speed of the turbomachine and is specified by the pilot in order to realize the "acceleration thrust" law that protects the low-pressure compressor (not shown) of the turbomachine from stalling, and P1 being the pressure on the input side of this low-pressure compressor. A valve for protecting the bellows 34 completes the architecture of this regulator, which of course also has inlets and outlets for the high-pressure hydraulic feed HP and the low-pressure hydraulic feed LP.<br>
If the equilibrium of the forces being applied to the beam of the balance 20 is written down, it is found that such a regulator simply controls the opening position of the fuel feed unit as a function of the pressure differential (3P3 - Pi, the position being a linear function thereof. Specifically, it may be shown that this position Xf is given by the following formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
A and B being constants.<br>
Thus, for a given turbomachine engine acceleration law, which offers the particular feature in the example illustrated of being expressed by a simple geometric equation (for example a linear law 50 or a parabolic law 52) in a graph of the flow rate of injected fuel as a function of ßP3 - P1, as shown in Figure 11, and corresponds to a linear feed flow rate law 54 or a parabolic feed flow rate law 56, as shown in Figure 12.<br>
However, this simplicity of construction of the regulator is only conceivable if there is just one acceleration law. This is because if it is desired to apply two different acceleration laws, such as those shown in Figure 11, it is quickly apparent that the two<br><br>
curves representing the corresponding feed flow rate law overlap on the x-axis (see Figure 12) , which makes it impossible to produce a single opening for the feed unit and therefore makes it necessary to use two fuel feed units. This results in many drawbacks, both in terms of weight and cost, reliability or precision of the feed.<br>
Objects and definition of the invention<br>
The object of the present invention is therefore to provide a hydromechanical regulator that alleviates the aforementioned drawbacks and therefore allows there to be two different acceleration laws using just a single fuel feed unit. Another object of the invention is to ensure switching between the two acceleration laws without a risk of fuel overfeed or underfeed.<br>
These objects are achieved by a hydromechanical regulator for controlling the flow of fuel injected into a turbomachine by means of a fuel feed unit, comprising a tachometric balance having a beam consisting of two arms, which beam can move about a pivot pin under the action of at least a first force applied by a drive rod of the fuel feed unit via a first elastic member, characterized in that it furthermore includes a rod associated with a control piston for applying, via a second elastic member, a force opposing the said first force to the said beam of the balance so as to cause the fuel feed unit to open further during the transition from a first engine acceleration law to a second engine acceleration law.<br>
Thus, with this configuration, the transition from one engine acceleration law to the other takes place progressively without any break in flow and by using just a single feed unit.<br>
Preferably, the said first force is applied to a fixed<br><br>
point on the first lever arm at a distance Lf from the said pivot pin and the said opposing force is applied to another fixed point on the said first lever arm at a distance Lc from the said pivot pin.<br>
Advantageously, the said rod of the drive piston is furthermore coupled to an on/off pneumatic valve for switching between the said first engine acceleration law and the said second engine acceleration law and connected, on one side, to a reference pressure P0 and, on the other side, via air orifices S0 and S1, to a pressure P3 on the output side of a high-pressure compressor of the turbomachine.<br>
For a given engine acceleration law, the said pressure P0 corresponds to the pressure on the inlet side of the high-pressure compressor or to atmospheric pressure. Preferably, one of the said air orifices is adjustable in order to allow the said second acceleration law to be regulated.<br>
The invention also relates to the fuel feed unit used in the aforementioned hydromechanical regulator and to a turbomachine that includes this regulator. Thus, the feed unit includes a single feed opening ensuring, for the flow of fuel injected into the turbomachine, a continuous variation upon passing from the first engine acceleration law to the second engine acceleration law.<br>

Detailed description of a preferred embodiment<br>
A hydromechanical regulator according to the invention, intended to be used in a turbomachine, is schematically illustrated in Figures 1 and 2. This regulator is intended to regulate the flow of fuel injected into the turbomachine by modifying the cross section of a feed orifice of the fuel feed unit. The aim of this modification is to comply with two operating laws corresponding to the fuel requirement for turbomachine<br><br>
acceleration and to allow switching between these two laws. The first law corresponds to the start-up regime and the second to the operating regime, from idling to full throttle, depending on the rotation speed of the turbomachine and on the position of the control lever.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates the regulator in a first position corresponding to the operating regime of the turbomachine engine that follows a first acceleration law (ß = 1) and Figure 2 illustrates this same regulator in a second position corresponding to an operating regime of the turbomachine engine that follows a second acceleration law (ß = 0.5).<br>
As in the structure of the prior art, there is again a high-pressure fuel pump 14 that withdraws fuel from a fuel tank (not shown) in order to bring it via a fuel feed unit 10 to injectors of a combustion chamber 16 of the turbomachine. The cross section of the feed orifice is modified by displacement of the rod 18 of the feed unit driven through a compressed spring 28 by the force balance 2 0 which can move about its pivot pin 22 and comprises a beam having two arms 24, 26.<br>
As illustrated in Figure 3, this beam is subjected to the downward force F1 applied by the rod 18 of the fuel feed unit, via the first elastic member 28, at a fixed point on the first lever arm 24, at a distance Lf from the pivot pin, to the upward force F2 applied by a nozzle 30 that injects a jet of pressurized fuel against this first lever arm, at a fixed point at a distance Ln from the pivot pin, and to the downward force F3 resulting from the application in an air bellows 32 of a pressure differential ßP3 - P1, at a distance Lb from the pivot pin, at a fixed point on the second arm 26. As previously, a safety valve for protecting the bellows 34 completes the architecture of this regulator, which of course also includes inlets and outlets  for the high-pressure and low-pressure<br><br>
hydraulic feeds.<br>
However, according to the invention, the beam of the force balance 20 is also subjected to an additional upward force F4 which is applied to a fixed point on the first lever arm 24 at a distance Lc from the pivot pin (which is less than the distance Lf in the example illustrated) by a rod 3 6 associated with a control piston 38 via second elastic member 40 of the compressed spring type with a stiffness Kc and a force at rest Fc0. The piston, which slides in a cylinder 42 over a travel Xc, is driven by a control pressure Pc feeding an inlet 42A of this cylinder, an outlet 42B of which is connected to the high-pressure feed HP. The consequence of applying this control pressure, and therefore correspondingly the force F4, to the lever of the balance 20 is to impose an additional displacement (in the direction of opening) of the feed unit 10, the effect of which is to ensure continuity in the flow of fuel injected by the feed unit as a function of its position during the transition from the first acceleration law to the second acceleration law, as will be explained below in conjunction with Figures 4 to 8.<br>
Furthermore, the rod 36 is coupled to a pneumatic on/off valve 44 forming a two-position switch. In the "closed" position (as in Figure 1) , the inlet of the air bellows 32 is isolated from a reference pressure P0 and is therefore connected directly to the pressure P3, and in the "open" position (as in Figure 2) , the inlet of the air bellows 32 is connected to this pressure P0 and to the pressure P3 via a pneumatic potentiometer formed from two orifices, an exhaust orifice S0 mounted in the feed line at the pressure P0 and an intake orifice S1 mounted in the feed line at the pressure P3. Since the pressure P0 advantageously corresponds to the pressure on the input side of the high-pressure compressor, or to atmospheric pressure, and since the<br><br>
air orifices S0 and Si are identical, the ratio (3 has the value 1 and the  value 0.5, respectively, corresponding to the two desired acceleration laws. This ratio is constant whenever the flow in the orifice S0 is sonic (which is obtained when ß P3/P0 &gt; 1.89 approximately). Preferably, one of the air orifices (advantageously, the exhaust orifice S0) is adjustable (for example by means of a set screw) for precise regulation of the second acceleration law.<br>
Thus, with this particular architecture, the value of ß and that of the switching force F4 are controlled by one and the same hydromechanical member, thereby guaranteeing perfect synchronization during the transition from one acceleration law to the other.<br>
As initially, it is possible to determine the new feed unit position Xf from the equilibrium equation of the lever:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in which:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
and<br>
Fi = XfKf + Ff0, Sbeiiows being the cross section of the bellows 32, and Kf and Ff0 being the stiffness and the force at rest of the spring 28, respectively.<br>
Therefore:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
i.e., again in relation to equation (1), but without F4:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
where 8Xf = (F4LC) / (KfLf)  corresponds to an additional displacement of the feed unit owing to the action of the control force F4.<br>
The  operation  of   the  hydromechanical   regulator<br><br>
according to the invention will now be explained in conjunction with Figures 4 to 8 which illustrate the change in engine acceleration law for two extreme operating points of the engine (the two flight extremes), the first corresponding to a maximum altitude and a minimum Mach number and the second corresponding to a minimum altitude and a maximum Mach number. In these graphs, it may be seen that the feed flow rate Wf changes progressively between the two engine acceleration laws without there ever being an overfeed or an underfeed situation, and therefore that, according to the invention, this regulator allows the engine acceleration law to be changed progressively and continuously using a single feed unit.<br>
Figures 4 and 6 each show two curves, one curve 50 corresponding to a linear acceleration law (the transient operating regime between relight and idling) and the other curve 52 corresponding to a parabolic acceleration law (the operating regime between idling and full throttle) . These two curves overlap and the maximum flow rate for the first acceleration law is less than the minimum flow rate for the second acceleration law. Figure 4 is an enlargement of the overlap region of the two acceleration laws shown in Figure 6. Figures 5 and 7 each show the law of variation of the feed flow rate, that is to say the variation of the flow rate Wf of injected fuel as a function of the position Xf of this feed unit. It may be seen that, when, in the transient regime, the engine operating point switches from point A on the first acceleration law to point B on the second acceleration law (Figure 4), the displacement of the feed unit moves continuously up the feed unit flow rate curve 58 from point A' to point B' (Figure 5) . Likewise, when the engine operating point switches from point C on the first acceleration law to point D on the second acceleration law (Figure 6) , the displacement of the feed unit moves continuously from point C to point D'<br><br>
(Figure 7)<br>
The cross section of the single feed slot (or opening) of the feed unit 10 is illustrated in Figure 8 (for greater clarity, the figure has not been drawn to scale) . It has a shape determined by the two aforementioned acceleration laws and varies linearly as a function of Xf. The rectangular slot portion 60 corresponds to the linear acceleration law (the transient operating regime between relight and idling) and the triangular slot portion 62 corresponds to the parabolic acceleration law (the operating regime between idling and full throttle), it being possible to adjust the initial flow rates by means of an orifice advantageously placed in parallel with the feed unit.<br>
To conclude, the configuration of the invention is particularly beneficial since, by using a single feed system to provide two flow rate laws, a weight saving and a space saving are achieved. Furthermore, the fact of using only a single independent system, and not two systems, increases the reliability and reduces the number of breakdowns possible. In addition, this single feed system allows switching from one law to the other without any risk of a break in fuel flow during the transition, and therefore there is no engine overspeed or "flame-out" problem.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
