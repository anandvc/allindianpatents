Description<br>
Technical Field<br>
[1]	The present invention relates to a medium access control (MAC) layer of a mobile<br>
communications system and, more particularly, to a system and method for<br>
configuring data of the MAC layer.<br>
Background Art<br>
[2]	A universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS) is a third-generation<br>
mobile communications system evolving from a global system for mobile commu-<br>
nications system (GSM), which is the European standard. The UMTS is aimed at<br>
providing enhanced mobile communications services based on the GSM core network<br>
and wideband code-division multiple-access (W-CDMA) technologies.<br>
[3]	In December 1998, ETSI of Europe, ARIB/TTC of Japan, T1 of the United States,<br>
and TTA of Korea formed a Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) for creating<br>
detailed specifications of the UMTS technology. Within the 3GPP, in order to achieve<br>
rapid and efficient technical development of the UMTS, five technical specification<br>
groups (TSG) have been created for determining the specification of the UMTS by<br>
considering the independent nature of the network elements and their operations.<br>
[4]	Each TSG develops, approves, and manages the specification within a related<br>
region. Among these groups, the radio access network (RAN) group (TSG-RAN)<br>
develops the specifications for the functions, requirements, and interface of the UMTS<br>
terrestrial radio access network (UTRAN), which is a new radio access network for<br>
supporting W-CDMA access technology in the UMTS.<br>
[5]	A related art UMTS network structure 1 is illustrated in Figure 1. As shown, a<br>
mobile terminal, or user equipment (UE) 2 is connected to a core network (CN) 4<br>
through a UMTS terrestrial radio access network (UTRAN) 6. The UTRAN 6<br>
configures, maintains and manages a radio access bearer for communications between<br>
the UE 2 and the core network 4 to meet end-to-end quality of service requirements.<br>
[6]	The UTRAN 6 includes a plurality of radio network subsystems (RNS) 8, each of<br>
which comprises one radio network controller (RNC) 10 for a plurality base stations,<br>
or Node Bs 12. The RNC 10 connected to a given base station 12 is the controlling<br>
RNC for allocating and managing the common resources provided for any number of<br>
UEs 2 operating in one cell One or more cells exist in one Node B. The controlling<br>
RNC 10 controls traffic load, cell congestion, and the acceptance of new radio links. -<br>
Each Node B 12 may receive an uplink signal from a UE 2 and may transmit a<br><br>
downlink signals to the UE 2. Each Node B 12 serves as an access point enabling a UE<br>
2 to connect to the UTRAN 6, while an RNC 10 serves as an access point for<br>
connecting the corresponding Node Bs to the core network 4.<br>
[7]	Among the radio network subsystems 8 of the UTRAN 6, the serving RNC 10 is the<br>
RNC managing dedicated radio resources for the provision of services to a specific UE<br>
2 and is the access point to the core network 4 for data transfer to the specific UE. All<br>
other RNCs 10 connected to the UE 2 are drift RNCs, such that there is only one<br>
serving RNC connecting the UE to the core network 4 via the UTRAN 6. The drift<br>
RNCs 10 facilitate the routing of user data and allocate codes as common resources.<br>
[8]	The interface between the UE 2 and the UTRAN 6 is realized through a radio<br>
interface protocol established in accordance with radio access network specifications<br>
describing a physical layer (L1), a data link layer (L2) and a network layer (L3)<br>
described in, for example, 3GPP specifications. These layers are based on the lower<br>
three layers of an open system interconnection (OSI) model that is well known in com-<br>
munications systems.<br>
[9]	A related art architecture of the radio interface protocol is illustrated in Figure 2. As<br>
shown, the radio interface protocol is divided horizontally into a physical layer, a data<br>
link layer, and a network layer, and is divided vertically into a user plane for carrying<br>
data traffic such as voice signals and Internet protocol packet transmissions and a<br>
control plane for carrying control information for the maintenance and management of<br>
the interface.<br>
[ 10]	The physical layer (PHY) provides information transfer service to a higher layer<br>
and is linked via transport channels to a medium access control (MAC) layer. Data<br>
travels between the MAC layer and the physical layer via a transport channel. The<br>
transport channel is divided into a dedicated transport channel and a common transport<br>
channel depending on whether a channel is shared. Also, data transmission is<br>
performed through a physical channel between different physical layers, namely,<br>
between physical layers of a sending side (transmitter) and a receiving side (receiver).<br>
[11]	The second layer includes a MAC layer, a radio link control (RLC) layer, a<br>
broadcast/multicast control (BMC) layer and a packet data convergence protocol<br>
(PDCP) layer. The MAC layer maps various logical channels to various transport<br>
channels. The MAC layer also multiplexes logical channels by mapping several logical<br>
channels to one transport channel. The MAC layer is connected to an upper RLC layer<br>
via the logical channel. The logical channel can be divided into a control channel for<br>
transmitting control plane information a traffic channel for transmitting user plane in-<br>
formation according to the type of information transmitted.<br>
[12]	The MAC layer is divided into a MAC-b sublayer, a MAC-d sublayer, a MAC-c/sh<br>
sublayer, a MAC-hs sublayer and a MAC-e sublayer according to the type of transport<br><br>
channel being managed. The MAC-b sublayer manages a broadcast channel (BCH),<br>
which is a transport channel handling the broadcast of system information. The MAC-<br>
c/sh sublayer manages common transport channels such as an FACH (Forward Access<br>
Channel) or a DSCH (Downlink Shared Channel) that is shared by other terminals. The<br>
MAC-d sublayer handles the managing of a DCH (Dedicated Channel), namely, a<br>
dedicated transport channel for a specific terminal. In order to support uplink and<br>
downlink high speed data transmissions, the MAC-hs sublayer manages an HS-DSCH<br>
(High Speed Downlink Shared Channel), namely, a transport channel for high speed<br>
downlink data transmission, and the MAC-e sublayer manages an E-DCH (Enhanced<br>
Dedicated Channel), namely, a transport channel for high speed uplink data<br>
transmissions.<br>
[13]	The RLC layer guarantees a quality of service (QoS) of each radio bearer (RB) and<br>
handles the transmission of corresponding data. The RLC layer includes one or two in-<br>
dependent RLC entities for each RB in order to guarantee a particular QoS of each RB.<br>
The RLC layer also provides three RLC modes, namely, a Transparent Mode (TM, an<br>
Unacknowledged Mode (UM) and an Acknowledged Mode (AM), to support various<br>
types of QoS. Also, the RLC controls the size of data to be suitable for a lower layer in<br>
transmitting over a radio interface. For this purpose, the RLC segments and con-<br>
catenates the data received from the upper layer.<br>
[14]	A PDCP (Packet Data Convergence Protocol) layer is a higher layer of the RLC<br>
layer and allows the data transmitted through a network protocol (such as an IPv4 or<br>
IPv6) to be effectively transmitted over a radio interface with a relatively small<br>
bandwidth. To achieve this, the PDCP layer performs a header compression function<br>
wherein only necessary information is transmitted in a header part of the data to<br>
thereby increase transmission efficiency over the radio interface. Because the PDCP<br>
layer performs the header compression as a basic function, it exists only at a packet<br>
switched (PS) domain. One PDCP entity is provided per RB to provide an effective<br>
header compression function with respect to each PS service.<br>
[15]	A BMC (Broadcast/Multicast Control) layer, located at an upper portion of the RLC<br>
layer in the second layer (L2), schedules a cell broadcast message and broadcasts the<br>
message to terminals located in a specific cell.<br>
[16]	A radio resource control (RRC) layer located at the lowest portion of the third layer<br>
(L3) is defined in the control plane and controls the parameters of the first and second<br>
layers with respect to the establishment, reconfiguration and release of RBs. The RRC<br>
layer also controls logical channels, transport channels and physical channels. Here,<br>
the RB refers to a logical path provided by the first and second layers of the radio<br>
protocol for data transmission between the terminal and the UTRAN. In general, the<br>
establishment of the RB refers to stipulating the characteristics of a protocol layer and<br><br>
a channel required for providing a specific data service, and setting their respective<br>
detailed parameters and operation methods.<br>
[17]	An HSUPA (High Speed Uplink Packet Access) will now be described in detail.<br>
The HSUPA is a system allowing a terminal or UE to transmit data to the UTRAN via<br>
the uplink at a high speed. The HSUPA employs an enhanced dedicated channel<br>
(E-DCH), instead of the related art dedicated channel (DCH), and also uses an HARQ<br>
(Hybrid ARQ) and AMC (Adaptive Modulation and Coding), required for high-speed<br>
transmissions, and a technique such as a Node B-controlled scheduling.<br>
[18]	For the HSUPA, the Node B transmits to the terminal downlink control information<br>
for controlling the E-DCH transmission of the terminal. The downlink control in-<br>
formation includes response information (ACK/NACK) for the HARQ, channel quality<br>
information for the AMC, E-DCH transmission rate allocation information for the<br>
Node B-controlled scheduling, E-DCH transmission start time and transmission time<br>
interval allocation information, transport block size information, and the like.<br>
[19]	The terminal transmits uplink control information to the Node B. The uplink control<br>
information includes E-DCH transmission rate request information for Node B-<br>
controlled scheduling, UE buffer status information, UE power status information, and<br>
the like. The uplink and downlink control information for the HSUPA is transmitted<br>
via a physical control channel such as an E-DPCCH (Enhanced Dedicated Physical<br>
Control Channel).<br>
[20]	For the HSUPA, a MAC-d flow is defined between the_MAC-d and MAC-e. Here, a<br>
dedicated logical channel such as a DCCH (Dedicated Control Channel) or a DTCH<br>
(Dedicated Traffic Channel) is mapped to the MAC-d flow. The MAC-d flow is<br>
mapped to the transport channel E-DCH and the transport channel E-DCH is mapped<br>
to the physical channel E-DPDCH (Enhanced Dedicated Physical Data Channel). The<br>
dedicated logical channel can also be directly mapped to the transport channel DCH. In<br>
this case, the DCH is mapped to the physical channel DPDCH (Dedicated Physical<br>
Data Channel). Such inter-channel mapping relationships are shown in Figure 3.<br>
[21]	The MAC-d sublayer will now be described in detail. A transmitting side MAC-d<br>
sublayer forms a MAC-d PDU (Protocol Data Unit) from a MAC-d SDU received<br>
from the upper layer, such as the RLC layer. A receiving side MAC-d sublayer restores<br>
the MAC-d SDU from the MAC-d PDU received from the lower layer and delivers it<br>
to the upper layer, such as the RLC layer. At this time, the MAC-d sublayer exchanges<br>
the MAC-d PDU with the MAC-e sublayer through the MAC-d flow or exchanges the<br>
MAC-d PDU with the physical layer via the DCH. The MAC-d sublayer performs a<br>
function, such as transport channel type switching for selectively switching a transport<br>
channel according to an amount of data, ciphering/deciphering for performing<br>
ciphering or deciphering on the MAC-d PDU, TFC selection for selecting a transport<br><br>
format combination (TFC) suitable for a channel situation, and a C7T Mux for<br>
managing a logical channel identifier (C/T) for identifying each dedicated logical<br>
channel when several dedicated logical channels are multiplexed and are to be mapped<br>
to one DCH or to one MAC-d flow. A C/T field, such as a logical channel identifier, is<br>
used only when a logical channel is multiplexed, and added to a header of each MAC-d<br>
SDU to form the MAC-d PDU. Presently, the C/T field is defined to have 4 bits. Thus,<br>
the maximum number of logical channels that can be multiplexed to one DCH or one<br>
MAC-d flow is 16. The structure of the terminal, namely, the transmitting side of the<br>
MAC-d sublayer for the HSUPA, is shown in Figure 4. A MAC-d format when the<br>
logical channels are multiplexed is shown in Figure 5.<br>
[22]	The transmitting side MAC-e sublayer forms the MAC-e PDU from the MAC-d<br>
PDU (namely, the MAC-e SDU), which is received through the MAC-d flow from the<br>
MAC-d sublayer. A receiving side MAC-e sublayer restores the MAC-e SDU from the<br>
MAC-e PDU received from the lower layer, namely, the physical layer and delivers it<br>
to the upper layer. In this case, the MAC-e sublayer exchanges the MAC-e PDU with<br>
the physical layer via the transport channel E-DCH.<br>
[23]	The MAC-e sublayer performs a different function depending on whether it belongs<br>
to the transmitting side or to the receiving side. First, the transmitting side MAC-e<br>
sublayer performs a function of scheduling/priority handling. Preferably, it schedules a<br>
data transmission according to uplink/downlink control information and processes the<br>
data according to a priority level of the data. The transmitting side MAC-e also<br>
performs a function of hybrid ARQ, such as reliably transmitting data at a high speed,<br>
and a function of TFRC (Transport Format and Resource Combination) selection, such<br>
as transporting a format suitable for a channel situation and resource combination<br>
selection.<br>
[24]	In particular, the scheduling/priority handling block also serves to form the MAC-e<br>
PDU to be transmitted to the physical channel. Specifically, the scheduling/priority<br>
handling block concatenates MAC-d PDUs (namely, MAC-e SDUs) received during a<br>
certain transmission time interval (TTI) through one MAC-d flow from the MAC-d<br>
sublayer according to their lengths. The scheduling/priority block then adds the length<br>
information to the MAC-e header, adds a 6-bit transmission sequence number (TSN)<br>
of the transport block to be transmitted to the header, and adds a 3-bit PID (Priority ID)<br>
for identifying a priority level of the MAC-d flow and a logical channel to the header.<br>
Finally, the scheduling/priority handling block adds a 1-bit version flag (VF) to the<br>
header to form the MAC-e PDU in order to later support a different MAC-e PDU<br>
format.<br>
[25]	The structure of the transmitting side MAC-e sublayer and the MAC-e PDU format<br>
are shown in Figures 6 and 7. In general, a certain type of PDU format is used so that<br><br>
the receiving side receives data as a series of bit streams (e.g., 0, 1,0,1). Without de-<br>
termining a format, the receiving side cannot interpret each bit for what it means. In<br>
the HSUPA, the MAC-e PDU format is used with some restrictions, as shown in<br>
Figure 7. The restrictions are explained below.<br>
[26]	First, one MAC-e PDU is transmitted during one TTI. Thus, a TSN is added to<br>
every MAC-e PDU. Second, one MAC-e PDU includes only the data of logical<br>
channels which belong to the same MAC-d flow and has the same priority level. Thus,<br>
the PID is interpreted as a MAC-d flow ID + logical channel priority.<br>
[27]	Third, the data of several logical channels are multiplexed to one MAC-e PDU in<br>
order to obtain multiplexing gain. In general, the length of the SDU can be different for<br>
each logical channel, so information indicating the length of each SDU is added to the<br>
header.<br>
[28]	Of the above conditions, the length of the header of the MAC-e PDU is varied due<br>
to the third condition. The length information of the SDU includes three fields: a 3-bit<br>
SID (Size Index) field for indicating a length of each SDU, a 7-bit N field for<br>
indicating the number of SDUs having the length of the SID, and a 1-bit F (Flag) field<br>
for indicating whether the next field is the SID length information or a MAC-e SDU.<br>
Preferably, the length information of the SDU includes the three fields of SID, N and<br>
F, and its size (length) increases to correspond with the number of length types of the<br>
SDU.<br>
[29]	In order to wirelessly transmit a certain PDU via the physical channel, the PDU<br>
must have a determined length required for coding, modulation and spreading<br>
performed in the physical channel. Thus, the MAC-e sublayer generates a PDU<br>
suitable for a size required by the physical channel by padding an end portion of the<br>
PDU. Such padding portion serves to fit the size of the PDU and does not contain any<br>
information. When the receiving side receives the PDU, it discards the padding<br>
portion.<br>
[30]	The receiving side interprets the received bit streams according to the format shown<br>
in Figure 7. Preferably, the receiving side interprets the bit streams starting from the<br>
VF (1 bit), PID (3 bits), TSN (6 bits), SID (3 bits), N (7 bits), F (1 bit), and interprets<br>
the header until the F field indicates that the next portion is the SDU. When the F field<br>
indicates that the next portion is the SDU, the receiving side, starting from the next<br>
bits, disassembles the SDU according to the length information of the SDU.<br>
Preferably, the SDU is disassembled according to the length and the number of SDUs<br>
from the combination of SID, N and F. After extracting the SDU, a remaining portion<br>
is discarded as a padding portion.<br>
[31]	Notably, if the MAC-e SDU has the same length, the length information of one<br>
SDU can be used to inform the lengths of other SDUs despite the use of several logical<br><br>
channels for transmitting data. With reference to Figure 7, the first SDU length in-<br>
formation, specifically, the combination of SID1, N1 and F1, informs the data length<br>
of both a first logical channel (C/T=1) and a second logical channel (CVT=2), and Kth<br>
SDU length information, namely, the combination of SIDK, NK and FK informs the<br>
data length from the fourth logical channel (C/T=4) to the kth logical channel (C/T=k).<br>
Preferably, the MAC-e sublayer does not process the data by logical channel, but<br>
processes the data by the size of the MAC-e SDU.<br>
[32]	The structure of the receiving side MAC-e sublayer is shown in Figure 8. The<br>
HARQ block of the receiving side corresponds to the HARQ block of the transmitting<br>
side, and each HARQ process of the HARQ block performs an SAW (Stop And Wait)<br>
ARQ function with the transmitting side. When the receiving side receives one MAC-e<br>
PDU through the HARQ process, it reads the VF of the header of the MAC-e PDU to<br>
check its version, and checks the next PlD field to recognize which MAC-d flow and<br>
which priority level the received PDU corresponds to. This operation is performed in a<br>
re-ordering queue distribution block. The PDU is then delivered to a reordering block<br>
indicated by the PID. The reordering function of the receiving side is notable compared<br>
with the transmitting side. That is, the MAC-e sublayer receives the MAC-e PDUs<br>
through the HARQ out-of-sequence, but the RLC layer (namely, the upper layer<br>
following the MAC-d sublayer) requests in-sequence delivery. Accordingly, the MAC-<br>
e sublayer performs reordering to sequentially deliver the non-sequentially received<br>
PDUs to the upper layer.<br>
[33]	To perform the reordering, each PID has a reordering buffer. Although a certain<br>
PDU is successfully received, if the TSN is not in sequence, the PDU is temporarily<br>
stored in the buffer. Then, when an in-sequence delivery of the PDU is possible, it is<br>
delivered to the upper layer. A portion from the TSN, except for the VF and the PID of<br>
the header of the PDU, is stored in the reordering buffer. Thereafter, when the PDU is<br>
delivered to a disassembly block, the SDU is disassembled upon checking the SDU<br>
length information of the SID, N and F, and then delivered to the upper MAC-d<br>
sublayer. Preferably, only the MAC-e SDU (MAC-d PDU) is delivered through the<br>
MAC-d flow.<br>
[34]	In the HSUPA, the structure of the MAC-d sublayer of the UTRAN (the receiving<br>
side) is similar to the MAC-d sublayer of the terminal (the transmitting side).<br>
Especially, portions of the receiving side related to the HSUPA perform the functions<br>
of the transmitting side, but in opposite order. As for the operations related to the<br>
DCH, the only difference is that the terminal performs the TFC selection, while the<br>
UTRAN performs the scheduling/priority handling. Referring to the HSUPA,<br>
regarding the MAC-d PDUs received through the MAC-d flow from the MAC-e<br>
sublayer, the C/T Mux block reads the C/T field to detect which logical channel the<br><br>
data (i.e., MAC-d PDUs) belongs to, removes the C/T field, extracts the MAC-d SDU<br>
and delivers it via a channel indicated by the C/T field to the upper RLC layer. As<br>
aforementioned, the C/T field does not always exist, but exists when logical channels<br>
are multiplexed. If logical channels are not multiplexed, the received MAC-d PDU is<br>
the MAC-d SDU, so the C/T Mux block delivers such to the RLC layer. Figure 9 il-<br>
lustrates a structure of the MAC-d sub-layer of the UTRAN, the receiving side in the<br>
HSUPA.<br>
[35]	In the related art, numerous overheads are added in constructing the MAC-d PDU.<br>
Especially, when logical channels are multiplexed, the 4-bit C/T field (namely, the<br>
logical channel identifier) is added to each MAC-e SDU. Thus, when numerous MAC-<br>
e SDUs are included in the MAC-e PDU, overheads of the MAC layer are con-<br>
siderably increased. Such increase in the overheads leads to the reduction of<br>
throughput, therefore failing to meet a desired transmission rate required for high<br>
speed data communication.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>

[36]	The present invention is directed to reducing overheads of a MAC-e PDU.<br>
Technical Solution<br>
[37]	Additional features and advantages of the invention will be set forth in the de-<br>
scription which follows, and in part will be apparent from the description, or may be<br>

Mode for Invention<br>
[68]	The present invention relates to reducing overheads of a MAC-e PDU by ef-<br>
fectively processing a logical channel identifier (C/T field) added to each MAC-d<br>
SDU. Preferably, a MAC-e sublayer processes data not according to SDU size, but<br>
according to logical channels. When the MAC-e sublayer processes data according to<br>
logical channels, it is no longer necessary to add the logical channel identifier (C/T<br>
field) to each MAC-d SDU. Thus, one common logical channel identifier can be added<br>
to every MAC-d SDU transmitted via one logical channel. Accordingly, overheads due<br>
to the logical channel identifiers are considerably reduced.<br>
[69]	Figures 10 and 11 illustrate exemplary formats of a MAC-e PDU in accordance<br>
with a preferred embodiment of the present invention. The MAC-e PDU formats may<br>
differ depending on where the common logical channel identifier is added. Preferably,<br>
the common logical channel identifier may be added to a pay load portion of the MAC-<br>
e PDU as shown in Figure 10, or may be added to a header as shown in Figure 11.<br>
[70]	Although only two formats are shown in Figures 10 and 11, other formats can be<br>
formed according to how the position of the logical channel identifier is defined.<br>
Preferably, in case of adding the logical channel identifier to the pay load, it may be<br>
added after the logical channel data, rather than before the data. In case of adding the<br>
logical channel identifier to the header, it may be added between the SID and N, or<br>
between N and F, or after F, not only before the SID, N and F. In any case, the logical<br>
channel identifier is added once with respect to one logical channel, data, and its<br>
position must be previously defined so that the receiving side can decode it properly.<br>
[71]	Preferably, when using one or more MAC-e PDU formats in accordance with the<br>
present invention, the following points are noted. First, the SDU length information<br>
(SID, N, F) is added to a header for each logical channel regardless of the size of the<br>
SDU. Preferably, the SDU length information is added to logical channel even<br>
though the logical channels have the same size. Considering that a total of 11 bits of<br>
SDU length information are to be added so as to correspond to the number of logical<br>
channels despite the SDUs being the same size, the present invention initially appears<br><br>
to be ineffective. However, because the 4-bit C/T field is reduced for every MAC-e<br>
SDU, if four or more MAC-e SDUs belong to one logical channel, overhead<br>
production will be minimized.<br>
[72]	Second, the size of the SDU indicated by the SID corresponds to the size of the<br>
MAC-d SDU excluding the C/T field. Since the SDU size indicates only the MAC-d<br>
SDU size, when the transmitting side or the receiving side adds or interprets the SID, a<br>
value excluding the C/T field is used.<br>
[73]	Third, because the C/T field is added or separated, the function of the C/T Mux<br>
block in the MAC-d sublayer and the function of the scheduling/priority handling<br>
block or the disassembly block in the MAC-e sublayer is affected. Specifically, in the<br>
present invention, one C/T field is added to every MAC-d SDU which belongs to one<br>
logical channel and is transmitted together through the MAC-d flow. The scheduling/<br>
priority handling block of the transmitting side MAC-e sublayer combines the received<br>
MAC-d SDUs by logical channel and constructs a MAC-e PDU by adding the logical<br>
channel identification information to a determined position.<br>
[74]	When the disassembly block of the receiving side MAC-e sublayer transmits data to<br>
the MAC-d sublayer through the MAC-d flow, it transmits the data in units of MAC-d<br>
SDUs, not in units of MAC-d PDUs. The MAC-e sublayer then delivers one C/T field<br>
with respect to the MAC-d SDUs. The MAC-d SDUs are delivered together in order to<br>
discriminate logical channels of the MAC-d SDUs. Upon receipt, the C/T Mux of the<br>
receiving side MAC-d sublayer transfers the MAC-d SDUs, which have been received<br>
together, to a logical channel indicated by the C/T field, which has also been received<br>
therewith.<br>
[75]	As so far described, the system and method for configuring data of the MAC layer<br>
in accordance with the present invention has the following advantages. Because only<br>
one logical channel identifier is added to the data belonging to one logical channel<br>
when constructing a MAC-e PDU, overheads of the MAC-e PDU are reduced. Such<br>
reduction of the PDU overheads increases the data throughput, which is advantageous<br>
for a high-speed data communication system such as the HSUPA.<br>
[76]	Although the present invention is described in the context of mobile com-<br>
munication, the present invention may also be used in any wireless communication<br>
systems using mobile devices, such as PDAs and laptop computers equipped with<br>
wireless communication capabilities/Moreover, the use of certain terms to describe the<br>
present invention should not limit the scope of the present invention to certain type of<br>
wireless communication system. The present invention is also applicable to other<br>
wireless communication systems using different air interfaces and/or physical layers,<br>
for example, TDMA, CDMA, FDMA, WCDMA, etc.<br>
[77]	The preferred embodiments may be implemented as a method, apparatus or article<br><br>
of manufacture using standard programming and/or engineering techniques to produce<br>
software, firmware, hardware, or any combination thereof. The term "article of<br>
manufacture" as used herein refers to code or logic implemented in hardware logic<br>

(e.g., EEPROMs, ROMs, PROMs, RAMs, DRAMs, SRAMs, firmware, programmable<br>
logic, etc.).<br>
[78]	Code in the computer readable medium is accessed and executed by a processor.<br>
The code in which preferred embodiments are implemented may further be accessible<br>
through a transmission media or from a file server over a network. In such cases, the<br>

The present invention relates to transmitting data units of a radio protocol<br>
layer, wherein one logical channel identifier is added to one or more data units belonging<br>
to one logical channel. Because only one logical channel identifier is added to the data<br>
units belonging to one logical channel in constructing a MAC-e PDU, overheads of the<br>
MAC-e PDU are reduced. Such reduction of the PDU overheads increases data<br>
throughput, which is advantageous for a high-speed data communication system, such as<br>
the HSUPA.</td>
