				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a process for the preparation of slow<br>
release fertiliser for banana, sugarcane, coconut and paddy.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Most of the high analysis fertilisers that are normally used by the farmers are highly water soluble and release the nutrients spontaneously. Because of this fact, a sizeable portion of the nutrients are lost by the various mechanisms operating in the soil resulting in low nutrient use efficiency. For an efficient fertiliser technology, aim is to be focussed towards increasing the nutrient use efficiency rather enhancing the quantity of application of costly fertilisers. Nitrogen is more subjected to loss and its efficiency is only around 30-50% depending on the nature of the land (soil).<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of this invention is to propose an improved process<br>
for producing slow release fertiliser.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose a process for producing slow release fertiliser having a high performance and grain yield.<br>
Still another object of this invention is to propose a process for producing slow release fertilizer which exhibits a slow and steady release of nitrogen.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to propose a process for producing slow release fertilizer which left more available P.<br>
A further object of this invention is to propose a process for producing slow release fertilizer which enhanced the grain weight.<br>
DESPRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
According  to   this  invention   there  is  provided  a  process  for  the<br>
preparation of a slow release fertilizer comprising of:<br>
i)     mixing of phospho gypsum urea with NPK fertiliser and binding materials,<br>
ii)   grinding the mixture and sieving the same and thoroughly mixing the same,<br>
v) drying the mixture and feeding the resultant into a tableting machine for producing the said fertiliser in the desired size and form,<br>
vi) coating the NP fertiliser granules having a mesh size of -4 mm and +1 mm with coating materials such as bitumen dissolved in a solvent such as kerosene in a coating pan-coater with hot air, additional N and K being seperately supplied fertiliser materials.<br>
The slow release fertilizer formulation of the present invention was compared with the standard practice in all the field<br>
The SRF formulation could have prolonged 'N' availability in<br>
the  initial  stages analogous to other formulations due  to  its<br><br>
linear solubility. Hence the performance of this SRF formulations was superior to straight fertilisers and other formulations.<br>
In  order to find out the nature of release of nutrients  to<br>
soil  in the critical stages of rice growth, the available  N,  <br><br>
and  K  in  the soil were  estimated  during  tillering,  panicle<br>
initiation, flowering and harvesting stages.  In the case of SRF,<br>
the increase in N status confirmed up to panicle initiation  With<br>
slight decline thereafter.  This indicates the slow  and  steady<br><br>
release of  N  <br>
element  required<br><br>
which is considered as  the  first  and  foremost for crop growth.  The release of N in  SRF  was<br><br>
considerable only around 20 DAI which decreased gradually and not abruptly with duration.<br><br>
In the post harvest soil samples, the available P status for<br><br>
straight  and  formulation  of  SRF  were  comparable,  but   SRF<br>
formulation left more available P.<br><br>
An initial non-significant rise in K status at tillering declined thereafter maintaining more or less constantly for all the experimental trials. Among the three major nutrients, K is<br>
always  in dynamic equillibrium with different forms and  as  the available  K  starts depleting, it is  automatically  replenished<br>
from the reserves, therefore the added fertiliser at the  levels<br>
of  standard  addition might not have any chance to alter  the  K<br>
status.<br>
The  weight of grain is an indicator of productivity and  is<br><br>
proportional to<br><br>
the health of plants.  NPK application was  found<br><br>
to enhance the grain weight when applied in the form of SRF.  Any attempt to enhance the tillering may lead to increased grain.<br>
THEJ SLOW RELEASE FERTILISER FORMULATION IS PREPARED AS FOLLOWS<br>
The materiajl like FACTAMPHOS 20:20, having a -4 mm and +1 mm size, as manufactured by FACT, is coated with coating materials like bitumen, neem oil, trineem, wax etc. dissolved in kerosene<br><br>
oi 1, benzene or<br><br>
other suitable solvents.  The additional N and K<br><br>
are supplied by appropriate	fertiliser materials seperately.<br>
Example:<br>
FACTAMPHOS 20:20<br>
Mesh size	:	- 4 mm ,   + 1 mm.<br>
Quantity	:	7 to 8 Kgs.<br>
Bitumen etc.	:	75to200 gms.<br>
Solvent	:	100 to 200 ml.<br>
The FACTAMPHOS as shown above is taken in the pan-coater and it i .1 coated with the bitumen solution in kerosene oil. Hot air is blown during coating. This coated material is cooled.<br>
SLOW RELEASE FERTILISER FOR SUGARCANE The  nutrient  uptake  was estimated  at  grand  growth  and<br>
harvest  stages green tops and in different parts of the plant  including stem, trash.<br>
Enhancement in the uptake of N in stem, green top and trash of sugarcane due to application of SRFs was to a highly<br>
significant extent.<br>
Internode p.s an indirect measure of the growth of canes. The SFR in the form of tablet showed a higher magnitude of influence than mixture and straight fertiliser.<br>
Substantial improvement in yield has been realised with SRFs<br><br>
in the form of tablets over the conventional application of straight fertilisers. The positive effect of one of the constituents of; the formulation, which maintains a low pH, thereby reducing the Urease activity and as a consequence, a slow and steady release of N for a longer period is expected.<br>
PREPARATION OF THE FORMULATION FOR SUGARCANE<br>
Phospho-Gypsum-Urea adduct, clay, FACTAMFOS 20:20 were ground in a pulveriser and materials 100% passing through 1 mm. sieve were mixed with Ammonium Sulphate, Rockphosphate and Muriate of Potash in a paddle mixer. The mixed material is dried<br><br><br>
at  60  degree required size a<br><br>
C. and tabletised using a  tableting machine  to nd weight.<br><br>
Example:<br>
(Table Removed) <br><br>
SLOW RELEASE FERTILISER FOR BANANA BANANA   cultivation  occupies  a  significant  acreage   in<br>
i<br>
Tamilnadu.  Apart from its utility as a fruit, banana is consumed<br>
as  a  vegetable, chips etc.   According to Fertiliser Statistics 1996-97, banana occupies about 4 lakh ha. on all India basis with<br>
i<br>
a production of1O-18 million tonnes.<br><br>
The formulation prepared as tablet was found to be superior to the mixtures and straight fertiliser. The particular formulation has given an additional yield of 5 tonnes/ha over standard practice followed in the State.<br>
Slow relealse fertiliser tablets is ideal for long duration crops like sugarcane, banana and coconut.<br>
PREPARATION OF THE FORMULATION FOR BANANA<br><br>
Phospho-Gypsum-Urea  adduct, clay and FACTAMPHOS 20:20  were<br>
ground  in a pulverisor and 100% passing through 1 mm. sieve  are<br><br>
mixed in a paddle; mixer with Ammonium Sulphate, Rockphosphate and<br><br>
Muriate of Potash  The mixture is dried at 60 degree C. for  one hour then subjected to tableting using a tableting machine.<br>
Example,.:<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The  termS  and  expressions in  the  specification  are  of<br>
descriptive nature and are no limitation,  there being   no<br>
intention  in the; use of such terms and expressions of  <br>
excluding<br>
any equivalents or the features exemplified and described but it is understood that various other modes of carrying out the process herein are possible without departing from the scope and ambit of this invention,<br>
METHODS OF PREPARATION OF PHOSPHO-GYPSUM-UREA ADDUCT<br>
It contains 27% nitrogen. This is an adduct prepared from Urea and a solid waste product, Phosphogypsum (obtained from the Phosphoric acid plant of FACT). This is a slow release nitrogen fertiliser. In combination with other Phosphatic and Potassic materials, the product exhibits slow release property thereby resulting in increased yield of crops.<br>
Wet Phosphogypsum is mixed with requisite quantity of water in a paddle mixer The required quantity of Urea is added to the<br><br>
mixer. The contents are heated to form a uniform melt and cooled. The product is dried and stored.<br>
Example:<br>
Urea	:    1440 gm,<br>
Phosphogypsum	:    1360 gm.<br>
The     above     quantities   of  materials   are  taken     in     a    paddle provided  with  heating  arrangement.     The   contents   are  heated<br>
to melt with constant stirring and then it is cooled. Excess moisture is removed by drying the mix. The N-content of the product is 27%. The product is greyish in colour.<br>
_FORMULATION FOR COCONUT<br>
Coconut palms are one of the main long duration crop of Kerala State and the yield from coconut palms are one of the major source of income.<br>
The availability of fertiliser nutrients have a major role in the growth characteristics of the coconut palm. Evaluation studies were conducted on coconut seedlings. The availability of<br>
various  nutrients from the particular formulation were  observed<br><br>
from the growth rate of the seedlings.<br>
The number of leaves, girth of seedlings were observed among<br>
the  various growing seedlings.  It was seen that the  number  of<br>
leaves, and girth size were higher in the case of the use of slow release formulation tablets and was superior to other mixtures and straight fertilisers.<br>
A polymerisation product of urea and formaldehyde was  mixed<br>
with other nitrbgeneous,  phosphatic and  potassic  materials<br>
alongwith  binding  agents like clay, gypsum, wax and  neem cake<br><br>
etc. and mixing and blending all the ingredients drying the mixture and feedin'g to the tableting machine.<br>
PREPARATION  OF  THE   FORMULATION   FOR   COCONUT FACTAMPHOS   20:20,   Clay,   Urea   formaldehyde  were   ground     using<br><br>
a pulveriser and 100% passing through 1 mm. sieve, is mixed with ammonium sulphate,rock phosphate, muriate of potash and gypsum<br><br>
and mixed thoroughly using a paddle mixer. The mixture was dried at 60 degree C. and it is fed through a tableting machine to get tablets of required size and weight.<br>
