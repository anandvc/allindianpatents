				<td>[0001]  The present invention relates to processes and catalysts for the methanation of a gaseous mixture comprising hydrogen and carbon monoxide to prepare a methane-enriched product stream.  <br>
Background of the Invention<br>
[0002]  In view of numerous factors such as higher energy prices and environmental concerns, the production of value-added gaseous products from lower-fuel-value carbonaceous feedstocks, such as petroleum coke and coal, is receiving renewed attention.  In general, such carbonaceous materials can be converted to a plurality of gases, such as a gas mixture comprising carbon monoxide, hydrogen and methane, by the gasification of the material at elevated temperatures and pressures.<br>
[0003]  The production of gas mixtures comprising carbon monoxide and hydrogen from coal and other carbon sources is generally known in the art.  This type of gasification typically takes places at higher temperatures and pressures as disclosed, for example, in US4251227, US4252736, and US6114400.    <br>
[0004]  Gasification of such materials to favor production of methane is usually a catalytic process that takes place as slightly more moderate temperatures and pressures as disclosed, for example, in US3828474, US3998607, US4057512, US4092125, US4094650, US4204843, US4468231, US4500323, US4541841, US4551155, US4558027, US4606105, US4617027, US4609456, US5017282, US5055181, US6187465, US6790430, US6894183, US6955695, US2003/0167961A1, US2006/0265953A1, US2007/000177A1, US2007/083072A1, US2007/0277437A1, US2009/0048476A1, US2009/0090056A1, US2009/0090055A1, US2009/0165383A1, US2009/0166588A1, US2009/0165379A1, US2009/0170968A1, US2009/0165380A1, US2009/0165381A1, US2009/0165361A1, US2009/0165382A1, US2009/0169449A1, US2009/0169448A1, US2009/0165376A1, US2009/0165384A1, US2009/0217584A1, US2009/0217585A1, US2009/0217590A1, US2009/0217586A1, US2009/0217588A1, US2009/0217589A1, US2009/0217575A1, US2009/0217587A1 and GB1599932.  Even in processes that favor methane production, appreciable quantities of carbon monoxide and hydrogen are produced as well.<br>
[0005]  In both types of gasifications, fine unreacted carbonaceous materials are removed from the raw gases produced by the gasifier, the gases are cooled and scrubbed in multiple processes to remove undesirable contaminants and other side-products including carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide. <br>
[0006]  The reaction of carbon monoxide and hydrogen to produce methane has been carried out in the presence of a catalyst such as various iron, nickel or cobalt compounds.  Although these methanation catalysts are reasonably effective, such materials are highly sensitive to sulfur compounds and are quickly poisoned.  To avoid this and continue use of these catalysts, the gases fed to the methanation reactor must be treated to remove both organic and inorganic constituents containing sulfur, generally by first scrubbing the gas stream with a solvent such as methanol to eliminate most of the hydrogen sulfide and mercaptans, and then removing the last traces of these impurities by adsorption on reduced zinc oxide or a similar adsorbent. These catalysts also require periodic regeneration.  These feed gas purification and catalyst regeneration steps are expensive and time consuming.  <br>
[0007]  The development of carbon-alkali metal based methanation catalysts, such as disclosed in US3958957, has provided for more robust catalysts than the iron, nickel and cobalt catalysts.  These carbon-alkali catalysts are resistant to high temperature sintering and catalyst degradation, as well as resistant to poisoning by sulfur compounds.  Nevertheless, these carbon-alkali catalysts require the sacrifice of carbon material as well as alkali compounds that could otherwise be used as catalyst loaded carbonaceous feedstock in various gasification processes.<br>
[0008]  Therefore, a need remains for improved methods for producing a methane-enriched gas from gas mixtures comprising carbon monoxide and hydrogen, and alternative methanation catalysts for use in such processes.<br>

Detailed Description<br>
[0030]  The present disclosure relates to processes for producing methane from a gas mixture comprising carbon monoxide and hydrogen, which in certain embodiments can be integrated into a broader gasification process for converting a carbonaceous feedstock into a plurality of gaseous products including at least methane.  <br>
[0031]  The process for producing methane comprises providing a gaseous mixture comprising hydrogen and carbon monoxide into a reaction zone containing a specified carbon-alkali metal methanation catalyst to generate a methane-enriched gas.   The carbon-alkali metal methanation catalyst comprises an alkali metal-containing carbon char which can, for example, be generated and recovered from the gasification of a catalyst loaded carbonaceous feedstock during a catalytic gasification reaction, resulting in the production of a value added gas stream comprising methane, carbon monoxide and hydrogen, as well a catalyst loaded char as a byproduct.  Typically, in such as gasification process, the char byproduct can be treated to recover the alkali metal catalyst for reuse in preparing the catalyst loaded carbonaceous feedstock in an integrated gasification process; however, it has been discovered that the char byproduct can be advantageously used as a sulfur tolerant methanation catalyst for stand alone methanation reactions. <br>
[0032]  This robust methanation catalyst is resistant to high temperature sintering and catalyst degradation and therefore is particularly useful in embodiments wherein the gaseous mixture further includes sulfur (e.g., a gas stream prior to acid gas removal in a gasification reaction) that would generally poison non-sulfur tolerant methanation catalysts typically used in methanation reactions.  The recovery and reuse of char byproduct as a valuable sulfur tolerant methanation catalyst provides for savings of the time and expense associated with purchasing and/or manufacturing of expensive sulfur-tolerant methanation catalysts, and provides for the further use and recycling of a gasification by-product.  In addition, the use of the char-based methanation catalyst in methanation reactions of gaseous mixtures comprising carbon monoxide and hydrogen advantageously eliminates the requirement for any sulfur removal pretreatment of the gaseous mixture, e.g., acid gas removal of the gaseous products.  The char methanation catalyst is useful in methanation processes alone or in one or more down stream methanations of hydrogen and carbon monoxide containing gas streams produced by any method, e.g., catalytic gasification reactions of carbonaceous feedstocks.<br>
[0033]  The methanation catalyst can also be exploited in one or more downstream methanation steps in an integrated gasification processes to generate additional methane from the gas streams and produce methane-enriched gas.  In particular, the present invention provides improved integrated gasification methods where there advantageously can be no recycle of carbon monoxide or hydrogen to the gasifier.    <br>

Further, unless expressly stated to the contrary, &amp;quot;or&amp;quot; refers to an inclusive or and not to an exclusive or.  For example, a condition A or B is satisfied by any one of the following: A is true (or present) and B is false (or not present), A is false (or not present) and B is true (or present), and both A and B are true (or present). <br>
[0045]  The use of &amp;quot;a&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;an&amp;quot; to describe the various elements and components herein is merely for convenience and to give a general sense of the disclosure. This description should be read to include one or at least one and the singular also includes the plural unless it is obvious that it is meant otherwise. <br>
[0046]  The term “substantial portion”, as used herein, unless otherwise defined herein, means that greater than about 90% of the referenced material, preferably greater than 95% of the referenced material, and more preferably greater than 97% of the referenced material.  The percent is on a molar basis when reference is made to a molecule (such as methane, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and hydrogen sulfide), and otherwise is on a weight basis (such as for entrained carbonaceous fines).<br>
[0047]  The term “carbonaceous material” as used herein can be, for example, biomass and non-biomass materials as defined herein.  <br>
[0048]  The term “biomass” as used herein refers to carbonaceous materials derived from recently (for example, within the past 100 years) living organisms, including plant-based biomass and animal-based biomass.  For clarification, biomass does not include fossil-based carbonaceous materials, such as coal.  For example, see previously incorporated US2009/0217575A1 and US2009/0217587A1.<br>
[0049]  The term “plant-based biomass” as used herein means materials derived from green plants, crops, algae, and trees, such as, but not limited to, sweet sorghum, bagasse, sugarcane, bamboo, hybrid poplar, hybrid willow, albizia trees, eucalyptus, alfalfa, clover, oil palm, switchgrass, sudangrass, millet, jatropha, and miscanthus (e.g., Miscanthus x giganteus).  Biomass further include wastes from agricultural cultivation, processing, and/or degradation such as corn cobs and husks, corn stover, straw, nut shells, vegetable oils, canola oil, rapeseed oil, biodiesels, tree bark, wood chips, sawdust, and yard wastes. <br>
[0050]  The term “animal-based biomass” as used herein means wastes generated from animal cultivation and/or utilization.  For example, biomass includes, but is not limited to, wastes from livestock cultivation and processing such as animal manure, guano, poultry litter, animal fats, and municipal solid wastes (e.g., sewage).<br>
[0051]  The term “non-biomass”, as used herein, means those carbonaceous materials which are not encompassed by the term “biomass” as defined herein.  For example, non-biomass include, but is not limited to, anthracite, bituminous coal, sub-bituminous coal, lignite, petroleum coke, asphaltenes, liquid petroleum residues or mixtures thereof.  For example, see previously incorporated US2009/0166588A1, US2009/0165379A1, US2009/0165380A1, US2009/0165361A1, US2009/0217590A1 and US2009/0217586A1.<br>
[0052]  The terms “petroleum coke” and “petcoke” as used here includes both (i) the solid thermal decomposition product of high-boiling hydrocarbon fractions obtained in petroleum processing (heavy residues – “resid petcoke”); and (ii) the solid thermal decomposition product of processing tar sands (bituminous sands or oil sands – “tar sands petcoke”).  Such carbonization products include, for example, green, calcined, needle and fluidized bed petcoke.<br>
[0053]  Resid petcoke can also be derived from a crude oil, for example, by coking processes used for upgrading heavy-gravity residual crude oil, which petcoke contains ash as a minor component, typically about 1.0 wt% or less, and more typically about 0.5 wt% of less, based on the weight of the coke.  Typically, the ash in such lower-ash cokes comprises metals such as nickel and vanadium.<br>
[0054]  Tar sands petcoke can be derived from an oil sand, for example, by coking processes used for upgrading oil sand.  Tar sands petcoke contains ash as a minor component, typically in the range of about 2 wt% to about 12 wt%, and more typically in the range of about 4 wt% to about 12 wt%, based on the overall weight of the tar sands petcoke.  Typically, the ash in such higher-ash cokes comprises materials such as silica and/or alumina.  <br>
[0055]  Petroleum coke has an inherently low moisture content, typically, in the range of from about 0.2 to about 2 wt% (based on total petroleum coke weight); it also typically has a very low water soaking capacity to allow for conventional catalyst impregnation methods.  The resulting particulate compositions contain, for example, a lower average moisture content which increases the efficiency of downstream drying operation versus conventional drying operations.  <br>
[0056]  The petroleum coke can comprise at least about 70 wt% carbon, at least about 80 wt% carbon, or at least about 90 wt% carbon, based on the total weight of the petroleum coke.  Typically, the petroleum coke comprises less than about 20 wt% inorganic compounds, based on the weight of the petroleum coke.<br>
[0057]  The term “asphaltene” as used herein is an aromatic carbonaceous solid at room temperature, and can be derived, from example, from the processing of crude oil and crude oil tar sands.<br>
[0058]  The term “coal” as used herein means peat, lignite, sub-bituminous coal, bituminous coal, anthracite, or mixtures thereof.   In certain embodiments, the coal has a carbon content of less than about 85%, or less than about 80%, or less than about 75%, or less than about 70%, or less than about 65%, or less than about 60%, or less than about 55%, or less than about 50% by weight, based on the total coal weight.  In other embodiments, the coal has a carbon content ranging up to about 85%, or up to about 80%, or up to about 75% by weight, based on the total coal weight. Examples of useful coal include, but are not limited to, Illinois #6, Pittsburgh #8, Beulah (ND), Utah Blind Canyon, and Powder River Basin (PRB) coals. Anthracite, bituminous coal, sub-bituminous coal, and lignite coal may contain about 10 wt%, from about 5 to about 7 wt%, from about 4 to about 8 wt%, and from about 9 to about 11 wt%, ash by total weight of the coal on a dry basis, respectively.  However, the ash content of any particular coal source will depend on the rank and source of the coal, as is familiar to those skilled in the art.  See, for example, “Coal Data: A Reference”, Energy Information Administration, Office of Coal, Nuclear, Electric and Alternate Fuels, U.S. Department of Energy, DOE/EIA-0064(93), February 1995.<br>
[0059]  The ash produced from a coal typically comprises both a fly ash and a bottom ash, as are familiar to those skilled in the art.  The fly ash from a bituminous coal can comprise from about 20 to about 60 wt% silica and from about 5 to about 35 wt% alumina, based on the total weight of the fly ash. The fly ash from a sub-bituminous coal can comprise from about 40 to about 60 wt% silica and from about 20 to about 30 wt% alumina, based on the total weight of the fly ash. The fly ash from a lignite coal can comprise from about 15 to about 45 wt% silica and from about 20 to about 25 wt% alumina, based on the total weight of the fly ash.  See, for example, Meyers, et al. “Fly Ash. A Highway Construction Material.” Federal Highway Administration, Report No. FHWA-IP-76-16, Washington, DC, 1976.<br>
[0060]  The bottom ash from a bituminous coal can comprise from about 40 to about 60 wt% silica and from about 20 to about 30 wt% alumina, based on the total weight of the bottom ash. The bottom ash from a sub-bituminous coal can comprise from about 40 to about 50 wt% silica and from about 15 to about 25 wt% alumina, based on the total weight of the bottom ash.  The bottom ash from a lignite coal can comprise from about 30 to about 80 wt% silica and from about 10 to about 20 wt% alumina, based on the total weight of the bottom ash.  See, for example, Moulton, Lyle K. “Bottom Ash and Boiler Slag,” Proceedings of the Third International Ash Utilization Symposium. U.S. Bureau of Mines, Information Circular No. 8640, Washington, DC, 1973.<br>
[0061]  The term “unit” refers to a unit operation.  When more than one “unit” is described as being present, those units are operated in a parallel fashion.  A single “unit”, however, may comprise more than one of the units in series.  For example, an acid gas removal unit may comprise a hydrogen sulfide removal unit followed in series by a carbon dioxide removal unit.  As another example, a trace contaminant removal unit may comprise a first removal unit for a first trace contaminant followed in series by a second removal unit for a second trace contaminant.  As yet another example, a methane compressor unit may comprise a first methane compressor to compress the methane product stream to a first pressure, followed in series by a second methane compressor to further compress the methane product stream to a second (higher) pressure. <br>

Methanation Reaction<br>
[0063]    The char methanation catalyst of the invention can be used for the methanation of a gaseous mixture comprising hydrogen and carbon monoxide to produce a methane-enriched gas.  The gaseous mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide can be derived from any source including gasification of any carbonaceous feedstocks (e.g., anthracite, bituminous coal, sub-bituminous coal, lignite, petroleum coke (petcoke), asphaltenes, liquid petroleum residues (liquid resid), biomass, or mixtures thereof).  The methanation reaction can be carried out in any suitable reactor, e.g, a single-stage methanation reactor, a series of single-stage methanation reactors or a multistage reactor.  Methanation reactors include, without limitation, fixed bed, moving bed or fluidized bed reactors.  See, for instance, US3958957, US4252771, US3996014 and US4235044.<br>
[0064]  Operating conditions for a methanator utilizing the char catalyst can be similar to those set forth in previously incorporated US3958957. <br>
[0065]  In one embodiment, the methanation process can be carried out in a single stage. A gaseous mixture comprising hydrogen and carbon monoxide is introduced into a reaction zone, e.g, a reaction chamber of a single stage methanation reactor, containing the char methanation catalyst of the invention.  At least a portion of the hydrogen reacts with at least a portion of the carbon monoxide, under suitable temperature and pressure, to produce a methane-enriched gas. The methane-enriched gas may be further processed, e.g., acid removal to remove hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide. The gaseous mixture can be derived from any suitable carbon-based source, e.g., gasification of a carbon-based feedstock such as coal, petcoke, other fossil fuel-based sources and/or biomass. <br>
[0066]  In another embodiment, the methanation process of the invention can be carried out in multiple stages, e.g., multiple reaction zones, allowing for cooling the gas between successive stages to recover the exothermic heat which is liberated during the methanation process. This generally involves a series of separate reactors with heat exchangers or other heat recovery units integrated into and/or interposed between adjacent reaction vessels, but in some cases reactors containing two or more methanation stages and intercoolers or similar internal means for removing heat between stages may be employed, such as described in US3958957.  The reactors used may be fixed bed, moving bed or fluidized bed units.  Certain fixed bed reactors can be of the downflow type in which the gas moves downwardly through catalyst particles supported on trays or similar internal supporting elements but fixed bed units of other types can also be used.<br>
[0067]  In another embodiment, the methanation process can be incorporated into an integrated gasification reaction of a carbonaceous feedstock whereby char byproduct generated (along with value-added gas products) in the catalytic reactor is transferred to one or more methanation reactors for use as a methanation catalyst.  A gaseous mixture comprising carbon monoxide and hydrogen is then introduced into the methanation reactor(s) containing the char methanation catalyst to produce a methane-enriched gas, wherein the gaseous mixture is not a gas stream produced by the gasification reaction.<br>
[0068]  In another embodiment, the methanation process is incorporated as one or more methanation steps in an integrated gasification reaction of a carbonaceous feedstock.  Gasification reactions of carbonaceous feedstocks in a catalytic gasifier generally produce gaseous mixtures that include hydrogen and carbon monoxide along with char as a byproduct. This char, as discussed herein, may be used in whole or in part as the methanation catalyst and any remaining portions can be treated for alkali catalyst recovery. The gasification reaction produces gaseous mixtures that comprises carbon monoxide and hydrogen, but can further include other gas components, e.g., carbon dioxide, methane, steam and sulfur-containing contaminants (e.g., hydrogen sulfide and COS).  The gaseous mixture from the gasifier can optionally be cooled to the desired methanation temperature by passing it through a heat recovery unit, e.g., a heat exchanger, where it passes in indirect heat exchange with water or other cooling fluid introduced through an input line and withdrawn as steam or hot fluid by means of an outlet line. The cooled gas is withdrawn from the heat recovery unit through a gas outlet line and will normally have a temperature of from about 250ºC, or from about 275°C, or from about 300°C, to about 600ºC, or to about 550°C, or to about 500°C, prior to entry into the methanation stage(s).  <br>
[0069]  Generally, the methanation reaction in the presence of the carbon-alkali metal methanation catalyst can be carried out at temperatures ranging from about 450°C, or from about 475°C, or from about 500°C, to about 650°C, or to about 625°C, or to about 600°C and at a pressure of from about 400 to about 750 psig.  The methanation reaction is exothermic in nature and hence the methane-enriched gas can be cooled between successive methanation stages and further treated after one or more successive methanation stages.  Treatments include, without limitation, acid gas removal to remove carbon dioxide, sulfur compounds and other impurities. <br>
[0070]  The resulting methane-enriched gas may, for example, be employed as a fuel of intermediate heating value (btu) content, or further methanated to produce a higher heating value synthetic natural gas.  In one embodiment, the resulting product is a “pipeline quality natural gas” as discussed below.<br>
[0071]  The gas withdrawn from the methanation reactor(s) has a content of methane that is materially higher (thus, methane-enriched) than the gaseous mixture exiting the catalytic gasifier, or any optional heat exchange unit.  This methane-enriched gas can be cooled to condense the steam and treated by conventional means to remove the acid constituents, (e.g., carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide) using conventional methods.  The resulting product gas will typically have a heating value in excess of about 800 btu/scf and can, therefore, be used as a fuel without further treatment. If desired, however, the purified gas can be further methanated at lower temperatures to produce a product gas having a heating value content similar to that of natural gas.  <br>
Char Methanation Catalyst<br>
[0072]  While general gasification processes are described below, it should be understood that other gasification procedures may be employed in combination with the char methanation catalyst of the invention. <br>
[0073]  The methanation catalyst of the invention comprises char and an amount of alkali metal.  Char, as used herein, generally refers to a solid carbon char.  In some embodiments char refers to the solid residue product that results from the catalytic gasification of a carbon source in the presence of steam and an alkali metal gasification catalyst.  Thus, in some embodiments, the char methanation catalyst is generated from gasification of an alkali metal catalyst-loaded carbonaceous feedstock.<br>
[0074]  Any type of carbon source (e.g., carbonaceous feedstock) can be used to generate the char methanation catalyst of the invention.  For example, in some embodiments, the carbon source can be coal, petcoke, asphaltene, liquid resid, biomass, or combinations thereof.  The resulting char particles size can vary widely, depending on the carbon source.  In some embodiments the average particle size of the char is from about 25µm to about 2500µm.  In other embodiments, the average particle size of the char is from about 25µm to about 1500µm.  In yet other embodiments, the average particle size of the char is from about 25µm to about 1000µm.  In yet further embodiments the average particle size of the char is from about 25µm to about 500µm.<br>
[0075]  The average particle density of the char methanation catalyst can also vary widely depending on the carbon source.  In some embodiments the particle density (in units of g/cc) of the char is from about 0.2 to about 1.75.  For certain embodiments that comprise less dense carbon sources (e.g., biomass), the particle density is typically from about 0.2, or from about 0.5, to about 1.65, or to about 1.25.  In other embodiments that comprise carbon sources with greater density (e.g., coal, petcoke), the particle density is from about 0.75 to about 1.75.  In yet other embodiments the particle density is from about 0.75, or from about 0.8, to about 1.65, or to about 1.25.  In yet further embodiments the particle density is from about 1.25, or from about 1.35, to about 1.75, or to about 1.65.<br>
[0076]  Given these average particle size ranges and particle density ranges, the BET surface area of the char methanation catalyst (in units of m2/g) ranges from about 10 to about 400, or to about 350, or to about 200, or to about 100.  In certain embodiments the BET surface area is from about 25 to about 400, or to about 350, or to about 200, or to about 100.  In other embodiments the BET surface area is from about 100, or from about 200, to about 400, or to about 350.<br>
[0077]  The carbon content (wt %, dry basis) of the char can also vary widely.  As used with respect to the char methanation catalyst, carbon content means organic carbon, including other molecules that are a part of the organic content (such as certain organosulfur and organonitrogen species).  In some embodiments, the char catalyst comprises an amount of ash which, with respect to the char catalyst, is taken to mean anything other than the organic carbon in the &amp;quot;carbon content.&amp;quot;  Accordingly, ash includes elemental oxides, inorganic carbonates, inorganic bicarbonates, metals, and the like.  Thus, the carbon content together with any ash constitutes 100% of the dry basis weight of the char methanation catalyst.  In some embodiments the char catalyst comprises a carbon content of from about 25% to about 85%, or to about 75%, or to about 60%, or to about 50%.<br>
[0078]  As noted in the prior paragraph, the char methanation catalyst can comprise ash, which includes an amount of elemental oxide.  In some embodiments the char catalyst comprises ash having total elemental oxide content (wt% of ash content, dry basis) of from about 65%, or from about 70%, to about 98%, or to about 90%.<br>
[0079]  The amount of alkali metal in the char catalyst can vary widely depending on the original carbon source, and can be conveniently expressed as a molar ratio with carbon content (alkali metal / carbon content, or &amp;quot;AIM/C&amp;quot;).  In some embodiments the molar ratio is from about 0.1, or from about 0.2, to about 0.6, or to about 0.4.<br>
[0080]  In one embodiment the carbon source comprises coal, with the char from coal having a carbon content of from about 25%, or from about 35%, to about 75%, or to about 60% (wt%, dry basis); a total elemental oxide content of from about 65%, or from about 70%, to about 98%, or to about 90% (wt% ash content, dry basis); an alkali metal content of from about 0.1, or from about 0.2, to about 0.6, or to about 0.4 (molar ratio AIM/C); a BET surface area of from about 100, or from about 200, to about 400, or to about 350 (m2/g); an average particle size of about from 25µm to about 2500µm, or to about 1500 µm; and a particle density of from about 0.75, or from about 0.8, to about 1.25, or to about 1.20 (g/cc).  <br>
[0081]  In one embodiment the carbon source comprises petcoke, with the char from petcoke having a carbon content of from about 25% to about 60%, or to about 50% (wt%, dry basis); a total elemental oxide content of from about 65%, or from about 70%, to about 98%, or to about 90% (wt% ash content, dry basis); an alkali metal content of from about 0.1, or from about 0.2, to about 0.6, or to about 0.4 (molar ratio AIM/C); a BET surface area of from about 10, or from about 25, to about 100 (m2/g); an average particle size of from about 25µm to about 1000µm, or to about 500 µm; and a particle density of from about 1.25, or from about 1.35, to about 1.75, or to about 1.65  (g/cc).  <br>
[0082]  In one embodiment the carbon source comprises biomass, with the char from biomass having a carbon content of about from 25% to about 75%, or to about 60% (wt%, dry basis); a total elemental oxide content of from about 65%, or from about 70%, to about 98%, or to about 90% (wt% ash content, dry basis); an alkali metal content of from about 0.1, or from about 0.2, to about 0.6, or to about 0.4 (molar ratio AIM/C); a BET surface area of from about 10, or from about 25, to about 400, or to about 350 (m2/g); an average particle size of from about 25µm to about 2500µm, or to about 1500 µm; and a particle density of from about 0.2, or from about 0.5, to about 1.65, or to about 1.25 (g/cc).  <br>
[0083]  In one embodiment, the char methanation catalyst is generated by the gasification of a carbonaceous material in the presence of steam and an alkali metal gasification catalyst.  In a further embodiment, the char methanation catalyst is a solid byproduct resulting from the gasification of a carbonaceous material in the presence of steam and an alkali metal gasification catalyst.  In yet a further embodiment, the char methanation catalyst is generated from the gasification of a carbonaceous material comprising anthracite, bituminous coal, sub-bituminous coal, lignite, petroleum coke (petcoke), asphaltenes, liquid petroleum residues (liquid resid), biomass, or mixtures thereof.<br>
[0084]  Typical catalytic gasification processes for producing a char suitable as a methanation catalyst are disclosed in a number of the previously incorporated references.  In such process, a catalyzed carbonaceous feedstock is typically fed into a gasifier, and gasified in the presence of steam at elevated temperatures and pressures, resulting in product gases (such as methane) and residue char.  A specific embodiment of a gasification process is described in detail below.<br>
[0085]  In one embodiment, the char is utilized in methanation steps incorporated into an integrated gasification process for producing methane-enriched gas from one or more gas streams including carbon monoxide and hydrogen.  Further details relating to the gasification, char production and integrated process are provided below.  <br>
Preparation of Catalyzed Carbonaceous Feedstock for Gasification<br>
 (a) Carbonaceous materials processing<br>
[0086]  Carbonaceous materials, such as biomass and non-biomass, can be prepared via crushing and/or grinding, either separately or together, according to any methods known in the art, such as impact crushing and wet or dry grinding to yield one or more carbonaceous particulates.  Depending on the method utilized for crushing and/or grinding of the carbonaceous material sources, the resulting carbonaceous particulates in may be sized (i.e., separated according to size) to provide a processed feedstock as the carbonaceous feedstock or for use in a catalyst loading processes to form a catalyzed carbonaceous feedstock. <br>
[0087]  Any method known to those skilled in the art can be used to size the particulates.  For example, sizing can be performed by screening or passing the particulates through a screen or number of screens.  Screening equipment can include grizzlies, bar screens, and wire mesh screens. Screens can be static or incorporate mechanisms to shake or vibrate the screen.   Alternatively, classification can be used to separate the carbonaceous particulates.  Classification equipment can include ore sorters, gas cyclones, hydrocyclones, rake classifiers, rotating trommels or fluidized classifiers.  The carbonaceous materials can be also sized or classified prior to grinding and/or crushing.<br>
[0088]  The carbonaceous particulate can be supplied as a fine particulate having an average particle size of from about 25 microns, or from about 45 microns, up to about 2500 microns, or up to about 500 microns.  One skilled in the art can readily determine the appropriate particle size for the carbonaceous particulates.  For example, when a fluid bed catalytic gasifier is used, such carbonaceous particulates can have an average particle size which enables incipient fluidization of the carbonaceous materials at the gas velocity used in the fluid bed catalytic gasifier. <br>
[0089]  Additionally, certain carbonaceous materials, for example, corn stover and switchgrass, and industrial wastes, such as saw dust, either may not be amenable to crushing or grinding operations, or may not be suitable for use in the catalytic gasifier, for example due to ultra fine particle sizes.  Such materials may be formed into pellets or briquettes of a suitable size for crushing or for direct use in, for example, a fluid bed catalytic gasifier.  Generally, pellets can be prepared by compaction of one or more carbonaceous material; see for example, previously incorporated US2009/0218424A1.   In other examples, a biomass material and a coal can be formed into briquettes as described in US4249471, US4152119 and US4225457.  Such pellets or briquettes can be used interchangeably with the preceding carbonaceous particulates in the following discussions.<br>
[0090]  Additional feedstock processing steps may be necessary depending on the qualities of carbonaceous material sources.  Biomass may contain high moisture contents, such as green plants and grasses, and may require drying prior to crushing.  Municipal wastes and sewages also may contain high moisture contents which may be reduced, for example, by use of a press or roll mill (e.g., US4436028).  Likewise, non-biomass such as high-moisture coal, can require drying prior to crushing.  Some caking coals can require partial oxidation to simplify catalytic gasifier operation.  Non-biomass feedstocks deficient in ion-exchange sites, such as anthracites or petroleum cokes, can be pre-treated to create additional ion-exchange sites to facilitate catalyst loading and/or association.  Such pre-treatments can be accomplished by any method known to the art that creates ion-exchange capable sites and/or enhances the porosity of the feedstock (see, for example, previously incorporated US4468231 and GB1599932).  Oxidative pre-treatment can be accomplished using any oxidant known to the art.<br>
[0091]  The ratio of the carbonaceous materials in the carbonaceous particulates can be selected based on technical considerations, processing economics, availability, and proximity of the non-biomass and biomass sources.  The availability and proximity of the sources for the carbonaceous materials can affect the price of the feeds, and thus the overall production costs of the catalytic gasification process.  For example, the biomass and the non-biomass materials can be blended in at about 5:95, about 10:90, about 15:85, about 20:80, about 25:75, about 30:70, about 35:65, about 40:60, about 45:55, about 50:50, about 55:45, about 60:40, about 65:35, about 70:20, about 75:25, about 80:20, about 85:15, about 90:10, or about 95:5 by weight on a wet or dry basis, depending on the processing conditions.<br>
[0092]  Significantly, the carbonaceous material sources, as well as the ratio of the individual components of the carbonaceous particulates, for example, a biomass particulate and a non-biomass particulate, can be used to control other material characteristics of the carbonaceous particulates.  Non-biomass materials, such as coals, and certain biomass materials, such as rice hulls, typically include significant quantities of inorganic matter including calcium, alumina and silica which form inorganic oxides (i.e., ash) in the catalytic gasifier.  At temperatures above about 500°C to about 600°C, potassium and other alkali metals can react with the alumina and silica in ash to form insoluble alkali aluminosilicates.  In this form, the alkali metal is substantially water-insoluble and inactive as a catalyst.  To prevent buildup of the residue in the catalytic gasifier, a solid purge of char comprising ash, unreacted carbonaceous material, and various alkali metal compounds (both water soluble and water insoluble) can be routinely withdrawn.<br>
[0093]  In preparing the carbonaceous particulates, the ash content of the various carbonaceous materials can be selected to be, for example, about 20 wt% or less, or about 15 wt% or less, or about 10 wt% or less, or about 5 wt% or less, depending on, for example, the ratio of the various carbonaceous materials and/or the starting ash in the various carbonaceous materials.  In other embodiments, the resulting the carbonaceous particulates can comprise an ash content ranging from about 5 wt%, or from about 10 wt%, to about 20 wt%, or to about 15 wt%, based on the weight of the carbonaceous particulate.  In other embodiments, the ash content of the carbonaceous particulate can comprise less than about 20 wt%, or less than about 15 wt%, or less than about 10 wt%, or less than about 8 wt%, or less than about 6 wt% alumina, based on the weight of the ash.  In certain embodiments, the carbonaceous particulates can comprise an ash content of less than about 20 wt%, based on the weight of processed feedstock where the ash content of the carbonaceous particulate comprises less than about 20 wt% alumina, or less than about 15 wt% alumina, based on the weight of the ash.<br>
[0094]  Such lower alumina values in the carbonaceous particulates allow for, ultimately, decreased losses of alkali catalysts in the catalytic gasification portion of the process.  As indicated above, alumina can react with alkali source to yield an insoluble char comprising, for example, an alkali aluminate or aluminosilicate.  Such insoluble char can lead to decreased catalyst recovery (i.e., increased catalyst loss), and thus, require additional costs of make-up catalyst in the overall gasification process.<br>
[0095]  Additionally, the resulting carbonaceous particulates can have a significantly higher % carbon, and thus btu/lb value and methane product per unit weight of the carbonaceous particulate.  In certain embodiments, the resulting carbonaceous particulates can have a carbon content ranging from about 75 wt%, or from about 80 wt%, or from about 85 wt%, or from about 90 wt%, up to about 95 wt%, based on the combined weight of the non-biomass and biomass.  <br>
[0096]  In one example, a non-biomass and/or biomass is wet ground and sized (e.g., to a particle size distribution of from about 25 to about 2500 µm) and then drained of its free water (i.e., dewatered) to a wet cake consistency.  Examples of suitable methods for the wet grinding, sizing, and dewatering are known to those skilled in the art; for example, see previously incorporated US2009/0048476A1.  The filter cakes of the non-biomass and/or biomass particulates formed by the wet grinding in accordance with one embodiment of the present disclosure can have a moisture content ranging from about 40% to about 60%, or from about 40% to about 55%, or below 50%.  It will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that the moisture content of dewatered wet ground carbonaceous materials depends on the particular type of carbonaceous materials, the particle size distribution, and the particular dewatering equipment used.  Such filter cakes can be thermally treated, as described herein, to produce one or more reduced moisture carbonaceous particulates which are passed to the catalyst loading unit operation.<br>
[0097]  Each of the one or more carbonaceous particulates can have a unique composition, as described above.  For example, two carbonaceous particulates can be utilized, where a first carbonaceous particulate comprises one or more biomass materials and the second carbonaceous particulate comprises one or more non-biomass materials.  Alternatively, a single the carbonaceous particulate comprising one or more carbonaceous materials utilized.<br>
	(b) Catalyst loading<br>
[0098]  The one or more carbonaceous particulates are further processed to associate at least one gasification catalyst, typically comprising a source of at least one alkali metal, to generate the catalyzed carbonaceous feedstock (30) (Figs. 1-3).<br>
[0099]  The carbonaceous particulate provided for catalyst loading can be either treated to form a catalyzed carbonaceous feedstock (30) which is passed to the catalytic gasifier (300), or split into one or more processing streams, where at least one of the processing streams is associated with a gasification catalyst to form at least one catalyst-treated feedstock stream.  The remaining processing streams can be, for example, treated to associate a second component therewith.  Additionally, the catalyst-treated feedstock stream can be treated a second time to associate a second component therewith. The second component can be, for example, a second gasification catalyst, a co-catalyst, or other additive. <br>
[00100]  In one example, the primary gasification catalyst can be provided to the single carbonaceous particulate (e.g., a potassium and/or sodium source), followed by a separate treatment to provide one or more co-catalysts and additives (e.g., a calcium source) to the same single carbonaceous particulate to yield the catalyzed carbonaceous feedstock (30).  For example, see previously incorporated US2009/0217590A1 and US2009/0217586A1.  The gasification catalyst and second component can also be provided as a mixture in a single treatment to the single carbonaceous particulate to yield the catalyzed carbonaceous feedstock (30).<br>
[00101]  When one or more carbonaceous particulates are provided for catalyst loading, then at least one of the carbonaceous particulates is associated with a gasification catalyst to form at least one catalyst-treated feedstock stream.  Further, any of the carbonaceous particulates can be split into one or more processing streams as detailed above for association of a second or further component therewith.  The resulting streams can be blended in any combination to provide the catalyzed carbonaceous feedstock (30), provided at least one catalyst-treated feedstock stream is utilized to form the catalyzed feedstock stream. <br>
[00102]  In one embodiment, at least one carbonaceous particulate is associated with a gasification catalyst and optionally, a second component.  In another embodiment, each carbonaceous particulate is associated with a gasification catalyst and optionally, a second component.<br>
[00103]  Any methods known to those skilled in the art can be used to associate one or more gasification catalysts with any of the carbonaceous particulates and/or processing streams.  Such methods include but are not limited to, admixing with a solid catalyst source and impregnating the catalyst onto the processed carbonaceous material.  Several impregnation methods known to those skilled in the art can be employed to incorporate the gasification catalysts.  These methods include but are not limited to, incipient wetness impregnation, evaporative impregnation, vacuum impregnation, dip impregnation, ion exchanging, and combinations of these methods.  <br>
[00104]  In one embodiment, an alkali metal gasification catalyst can be impregnated into one or more of the carbonaceous particulates and/or processing streams by slurrying with a solution (e.g., aqueous) of the catalyst in a loading tank.  When slurried with a solution of the catalyst and/or co-catalyst, the resulting slurry can be dewatered to provide a catalyst-treated feedstock stream, again typically, as a wet cake.  The catalyst solution can be prepared from any catalyst source in the present processes, including fresh or make-up catalyst and recycled catalyst or catalyst solution.  Methods for dewatering the slurry to provide a wet cake of the catalyst-treated feedstock stream include filtration (gravity or vacuum), centrifugation, and a fluid press.<br>
[00105]  One particular method suitable for combining a coal particulate and/or a processing stream comprising coal with a gasification catalyst to provide a catalyst-treated feedstock stream is via ion exchange as described in previously incorporated US2009/0048476A1.  Catalyst loading by ion exchange mechanism can be maximized based on adsorption isotherms specifically developed for the coal, as discussed in the incorporated reference.  Such loading provides a catalyst-treated feedstock stream as a wet cake.  Additional catalyst retained on the ion-exchanged particulate wet cake, including inside the pores, can be controlled so that the total catalyst target value can be obtained in a controlled manner.  The catalyst loaded and dewatered wet cake may contain, for example, about 50 wt% moisture.  The total amount of catalyst loaded can be controlled by controlling the concentration of catalyst components in the solution, as well as the contact time, temperature and method, as can be readily determined by those of ordinary skill in the relevant art based on the characteristics of the starting coal.<br>
[00106]  In another example, one of the carbonaceous particulates and/or processing streams can be treated with the gasification catalyst and a second processing stream can be treated with a second component (see previously incorporated US2007/0000177A1). <br>
[00107]  The carbonaceous particulates, processing streams, and/or catalyst-treated feedstock streams resulting from the preceding can be blended in any combination to provide the catalyzed carbonaceous feedstock, provided at least one catalyst-treated feedstock stream is utilized to form the catalyzed carbonaceous feedstock (30).  Ultimately, the catalyzed carbonaceous feedstock (30) is passed onto the catalytic gasifier(s) (300).  <br>
[00108]  Generally, each catalyst loading unit comprises at least one loading tank to contact one or more of the carbonaceous particulates and/or processing streams with a solution comprising at least one gasification catalyst, to form one or more catalyst-treated feedstock streams.  Alternatively, the catalytic component may be blended as a solid particulate into one or more carbonaceous particulates and/or processing streams to form one or more catalyst-treated feedstock streams.  <br>
[00109]  Typically, the gasification catalyst is present in the catalyzed carbonaceous feedstock in an amount sufficient to provide a ratio of alkali metal atoms to carbon atoms in the particulate composition ranging from about 0.01, or from about 0.02, or from about 0.03, or from about 0.04, to about 0.10, or to about 0.08, or to about 0.07, or to about 0.06. <br>
[00110]  With some feedstocks, the alkali metal component may also be provided within the catalyzed carbonaceous feedstock to achieve an alkali metal content of from about 3 to about 10 times more than the combined ash content of the carbonaceous material in the catalyzed carbonaceous feedstock, on a mass basis. <br>
[00111]  Suitable alkali metals are lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, cesium, and mixtures thereof.  Particularly useful are potassium sources.  Suitable alkali metal compounds include alkali metal carbonates, bicarbonates, formates, oxalates, amides, hydroxides, acetates, or similar compounds.  For example, the catalyst can comprise one or more of sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, rubidium carbonate, lithium carbonate, cesium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, rubidium hydroxide or cesium hydroxide, and particularly, potassium carbonate and/or potassium hydroxide. <br>
[00112]  Optional co-catalysts or other catalyst additives may be utilized, such as those disclosed in the previously incorporated references.  <br>
[00113]  The one or more catalyst-treated feedstock streams that are combined to form the catalyzed carbonaceous feedstock typically comprise greater than about 50%, greater than about 70%, or greater than about 85%, or greater than about 90% of the total amount of the loaded catalyst associated with the catalyzed carbonaceous feedstock (30).  The percentage of total loaded catalyst that is associated with the various catalyst-treated feedstock streams can be determined according to methods known to those skilled in the art.<br>
[00114]  Separate carbonaceous particulates, catalyst-treated feedstock streams, and processing streams can be blended appropriately to control, for example, the total catalyst loading or other qualities of the catalyzed carbonaceous feedstock (30), as discussed previously.  The appropriate ratios of the various stream that are combined will depend on the qualities of the carbonaceous materials comprising each as well as the desired properties of the catalyzed carbonaceous feedstock (30).  For example, a biomass particulate stream and a catalyzed non-biomass particulate stream can be combined in such a ratio to yield a catalyzed carbonaceous feedstock (30) having a predetermined ash content, as discussed previously. <br>
[00115]  Any of the preceding catalyst-treated feedstock streams, processing streams, and processed feedstock streams, as one or more dry particulates and/or one or more wet cakes, can be combined by any methods known to those skilled in the art including, but not limited to, kneading, and vertical or horizontal mixers, for example, single or twin screw, ribbon, or drum mixers.  The resulting catalyzed carbonaceous feedstock (30) can be stored for future use or transferred to one or more feed operations for introduction into the catalytic gasifiers.  The catalyzed carbonaceous feedstock can be conveyed to storage or feed operations according to any methods known to those skilled in the art, for example, a screw conveyer or pneumatic transport.  <br>
[00116]  Further, excess moisture can be removed from the catalyzed carbonaceous feedstock (30).  For example, the catalyzed carbonaceous feedstock (30) may be dried with a fluid bed slurry drier (i.e., treatment with superheated steam to vaporize the liquid), or the solution thermally evaporated or removed under a vacuum, or under a flow of an inert gas, to provide a catalyzed carbonaceous feedstock having a residual moisture content, for example, of about 10 wt% or less, or of about 8 wt% or less, or about 6 wt% or less, or about 5 wt% or less, or about 4 wt% or less.<br>
Integrated Gasification Process<br>
[00117]  The integrated processes of the invention for producing a methane-enriched gas and the char methanation catalyst can be employed with any type of alkali metal catalyzed gasification systems known in the art.  Examples of such systems include, for example, those disclosed in previously incorporated US Patent Applications Serial Nos. __/______, attorney docket no. FN-0040 US NP1, entitled PROCESSES FOR GASIFICATION OF A CARBONACEOUS FEEDSTOCK; __/______, attorney docket no. FN-0041 US NP1, entitled PROCESSES FOR GASIFICATION OF A CARBONACEOUS FEEDSTOCK; and __/______, attorney docket no. FN-0042 US NP1, entitled PROCESSES FOR GASIFICATION OF A CARBONACEOUS FEEDSTOCK).  <br>
[00118]  In an embodiment of an integrated process of the invention (see, Figure 1), a methane product stream (80) can be generated from an alkali metal catalyzed carbonaceous feedstock (30).  The catalyzed carbonaceous feedstock (30) typically comprises one or more carbonaceous materials and one or more gasification catalysts, as discussed above.  At least a portion of steam (51) from a steam source (500) can be provided to a catalytic gasifier (300), which is also provided with the alkali metal catalyst-loaded carbonaceous feedstock (30). Reaction of the catalyzed carbonaceous feedstock (30) under the described gasification conditions provides a hot gas stream (40) comprising a plurality of gaseous products comprising methane, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, carbon monoxide and hydrogen sulfide, and a solid char byproduct (35) from the catalytic gasifier.  The solid char byproduct (35) can be removed via a char outlet (not depicted) in catalytic gasifier (300) and provided to the reaction zone of a methanator (801) for use as a char methanation catalyst.  In one embodiment, the solid char product (35) is periodically withdrawn from the catalytic gasifier (300) through a char outlet which is a lock hopper system, although other methods are known to those skilled in the art.  Methods for removing solid char product are well known to those skilled in the art.  One such method taught by EP-A-0102828, for example, can be employed.<br>
[00119]  Any of the steam boilers known to those skilled in the art can supply steam for the catalytic gasifier (300).  Such boilers can be powered, for example, through the use of any carbonaceous material such as powdered coal, biomass etc., and including but not limited to rejected carbonaceous materials from the feedstock preparation operations (e.g., fines, supra).  Steam can also be supplied from an additional catalytic gasifier coupled to a combustion turbine where the exhaust from the reactor is thermally exchanged to a water source and produce steam.  Alternatively, the steam may be generated for the catalytic gasifiers as described in previously incorporated US2009/0165376A1 and US2009/0217584A1.<br>
[00120]  Steam recycled or generated from other process operations can also be used as a sole steam source, or in combination with the steam from a steam generator to supply steam to the catalytic gasifier (300).  For example, when the slurried carbonaceous materials are dried with a fluid bed slurry drier, as discussed above, the steam generated through vaporization can be fed to the catalytic gasifier (300).  When a heat exchanger unit (such as 600) is used for stream generation, that steam can be fed directly to the catalytic gasifier as well. <br>
[00121]  The catalyzed carbonaceous feedstock (30) can be provided to a catalytic gasifier (300), and the carbon content gasified in the presence of a gasification catalyst and steam and under suitable pressure and temperature conditions to generate a first gas stream (40) comprising a plurality of gaseous products typically comprising methane, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen sulfide.  The catalyzed carbonaceous feedstock (30) typically comprises one or more carbonaceous materials and one or more gasification catalysts, as discussed above.  <br>
[00122]  The catalytic gasifiers for such processes are typically operated at moderately high pressures and temperature, requiring introduction of the catalyzed carbonaceous feedstock (30) to a reaction chamber of the catalytic gasifier while maintaining the required temperature, pressure, and flow rate of the feedstock.  Those skilled in the art are familiar with feed inlets to supply the catalyzed carbonaceous feedstock into the reaction chambers having high pressure and/or temperature environments, including, star feeders, screw feeders, rotary pistons, and lock-hoppers.  It should be understood that the feed inlets can include two or more pressure-balanced elements, such as lock hoppers, which would be used alternately. In some instances, the catalyzed carbonaceous feedstock can be prepared at pressure conditions above the operating pressure of catalytic gasifier.  Hence, the particulate composition can be directly passed into the catalytic gasifier without further pressurization.<br>
[00123]  Any of several types of catalytic gasifiers can be utilized. Suitable catalytic gasifiers include those having a reaction chamber which is a counter-current fixed bed, a co-current fixed bed, a fluidized bed, or an entrained flow or moving bed reaction chamber.  <br>
[00124]  Gasification in the catalytic gasifier is typically affected at moderate temperatures of at least about 450°C, or of at least about 600°C, or of at least about 650°C, to about 900°C, or to about 800ºC, or to about 750°C; and at pressures of at least about 50 psig, or at least about 200 psig, or at least about 400 psig, to about 1000 psig, or to about 700 psig, or to about 600 psig.<br>
[00125]  The gas utilized in the catalytic gasifier for pressurization and reactions of the particulate composition can comprise, for example, steam, oxygen, nitrogen, air, syngas (mixtures of carbon monoxide and hydrogen) or inert gases such as argon which can be supplied to the reactor according to methods known to those skilled in the art.<br>
[00126]  The catalytic conversion of a carbon source to methane that occurs in the catalytic gasifier typically involves three separate reactions:<br>
[00127]  Steam carbon: C + H2O ? CO + H2		(I)<br>
[00128]  Water-gas shift: CO + H2O ? H2 + CO2		(II)<br>
[00129]  CO Methanation:  CO+3H2 ? CH4 + H2O		(III)<br>
[00130]  These three reactions are together essentially thermally balanced; however, due to process heat losses and other energy requirements (such as required for evaporation of moisture entering the catalytic gasifier with the feedstock), some heat must be added to the catalytic gasifier to maintain the thermal balance.  The addition of superheated steam at a temperature above the operating temperature of the catalytic gasifier can be one mechanism for supplying this extra heat.   A person of ordinary skill in the art can determined the amount of heat required to be added to the catalytic gasifier to substantially maintain thermal balance.  <br>
[00131]  Hot gas effluent stream (40) leaving the reaction chamber of catalytic gasifier (300) can pass through a fines remover unit portion (not depicted) of the catalytic gasifier which serves as a disengagement zone where particles too heavy to be entrained by the gas leaving the catalytic gasifier (i.e., fines) are returned to the reaction chamber (e.g., fluidized bed). The fines remover unit can include one or more internal and/or external cyclone separators or similar devices to remove fines and particulates from the hot first gas.  The hot first gas effluent leaving the catalytic gasifier generally comprises CH4, CO2, H2, CO, H2S, NH3, unreacted steam, entrained fines, and other contaminants such as COS, HCN and/or elemental mercury vapor, depending on the nature of the carbonaceous material utilized for gasification.  <br>
[00132]  Residual entrained fines can be substantially removed by any suitable device such as external cyclone separators optionally followed by Venturi scrubbers.  The recovered fines can be processed to recover alkali metal catalyst, or directly recycled back to feedstock preparation as described in previously incorporated US2009/0217589A1.  <br>
[00133]  Removal of a “substantial portion” of fines means that an amount of fines is removed from the hot first gas stream such that downstream processing is not adversely affected; thus, at least a substantial portion of fines should be removed.  Some minor level of ultrafine material may remain in hot first gas stream to the extent that downstream processing is not significantly adversely affected.  Typically, at least about 90 wt%, or at least about 95 wt%, or at least about 98 wt%, of the fines of a particle size greater than about 20 ?m, or greater than about 10 ?m, or greater than about 5 ?m, are removed.<br>
[00134]  The first gas stream (40), upon exiting reactor (300), will typically comprise at least about 20 mol% methane based on the moles of methane, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and hydrogen in the first gas stream.  In addition, the first gas stream will typically comprise at least about 50 mol% methane plus carbon dioxide, based on the moles of methane, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and hydrogen in the first gas stream.   <br>
[00135]  The first gas stream (40) may be provided to a heat exchanger (600) to reduce the temperature of the first gas stream (40) (e.g., to generate a cooled gas stream (50) having a temperature less than first gas stream (40)) for introduction to methanator (801) prior to introduction to acid gas removal (AGR) processes (700) for the methanation processes described herein.<br>
[00136]  Depending on gasification conditions, the gas stream (40) can be generated having at a temperature ranging from about 450°C to about 900°C (more typically from about 650°C to about 800°C), a pressure of from about 50 psig to about 1000 psig (more typically from about 400 psig to about 600 psig), and a velocity of from about 0.5 ft/sec to about 2.0 ft/sec (more typically from about 1.0 ft/sec to about 1.5 ft/sec).   The heat energy extracted by any one or more of the heat exchanger units (600), when present, can be used, for example, to generate steam. The resulting cooled gas stream (50) will typically exit the heat exchanger (600) at a temperature ranging from about 250°C to about 600°C (more typically from about 300°C to about 500°C), a pressure of from about 50 psig to about 1000 psig (more typically from about 400 psig to about 600 psig), and a velocity of from about 0.5 ft/sec to about 2.5 ft/sec (more typically from about 1.0 ft/sec to about 1.5 ft/sec).  Typically, the cooled first gas stream (50) will be passed to a methanator (801) prior to gas separations processes, such as acid gas removal, to produce a second gas stream (65). <br>
[00137]   A subsequent acid gas removal unit (700) can be used to remove a substantial portion of H2S and CO2 from the second gas stream (65) and generate a third gas stream (70), which can be a methane product stream (80) or can go through further purification/treatment to produce methane product stream (80).  Acid gas removal processes typically involve contacting the second gas stream (65) with a solvent such as monoethanolamine, diethanolamine, methyldiethanolamine, diisopropylamine, diglycolamine, a solution of sodium salts of amino acids, methanol, hot potassium carbonate or the like to generate CO2 and/or H2S laden absorbers.  One method can involve the use of Selexol® (UOP LLC, Des Plaines, IL USA) or Rectisol® (Lurgi AG, Frankfurt am Main, Germany) solvent having two trains; each train consisting of an H2S absorber and a CO2 absorber. <br>
[00138]  The resulting third gas stream (70) can comprise CH4, H2, and, optionally, CO when the sour shift unit (discussed below) is not part of the process, and typically, small amounts of CO2 and H2O.  One method for removing acid gases from the second gas stream (65) is described in previously incorporated US Patent Application Serial No. 12/395,344.<br>
[00139]  At least a substantial portion (e.g., substantially all) of the CO2 and/or H2S (and other remaining trace contaminants) should be removed via the acid gas removal units.  “Substantial” removal in the context of acid gas removal means removal of a high enough percentage of the component such that a desired end product can be generated.  The actual amounts of removal may thus vary from component to component.  For “pipeline-quality natural gas”, only trace amounts (at most) of H2S can be present, although higher amounts of CO2 may be tolerable. <br>
[00140]  Typically, acid gas removal should remove at least about 85%, or at least about 90%, or at least about 92%, of the CO2, and at least about 95%, or at least about 98%, or at least about 99.5%, of the H2S, from the second gas stream (65).<br>
[00141]  Losses of desired product (methane) in the acid gas removal step should be minimized such that the acid gas-depleted stream comprises at least a substantial portion (and substantially all) of the methane from the second gas stream (65).  Typically, such losses should be about 2 mol% or less, or about 1.5 mol% or less, or about 1 mol% of less, of the methane from the cooled first gas stream (50).<br>
[00142]  As just described, the integrated gasification processes of the present invention utilize at least one methanation step to generate methane from the carbon monoxide and hydrogen present in one or more of the first gas streams (e.g., hot first gas stream (40), and/or cooled first gas stream (50)), and/or third gas stream (70). For example, in one embodiment of the invention, at least a portion of the carbon monoxide and at least a portion of the hydrogen present in the cooled first gas stream (50) is reacted in a catalytic methanator in the presence of a sulfur-tolerant char methanation catalyst to produce a methane-enriched first gas stream, which can then be subjected to acid gas removal as described above.  In other embodiments of the invention, if the second gas stream (65) and/or third gas stream (70) comprises hydrogen and greater than above 100 ppm carbon monoxide, carbon monoxide and hydrogen present in the gas stream can be reacted in a catalytic methanator, e.g, a trim methanator (802) as shown in Figure 2, in the presence of a methanation catalyst, e.g., such as the char methanation catalyst, to produce a methane-enriched gas stream.  In certain embodiments of the invention, both of these methanation steps are performed.   <br>
[00143]  In another embodiment, as illustrated in Figure 2, the first gas stream (40) or cooled first gas stream (50) can be passed to a methanator (801) where carbon monoxide and hydrogen in the first gas streams (40) or (50) can be reacted to generated methane and thereby a methane-enriched second gas stream (65).  The first gas streams (40) or (50) typically contain significant quantities of hydrogen sulfide which can deactivate methanation catalysts such as catalysts comprising iron, nickel and cobalt compounds.  Therefore, in such embodiments, the methanator (801) contains a sulfur-tolerant methanation catalyst such as the char methanation catalyst described above, or alternatively a mixture of the char methanation catalyst of the invention and another sulfur-tolerant methanation catalyst such as, for example, molybdenum and/or tungsten sulfides.  Further examples of sulfur-tolerant methanation catalysts include, but are not limited to, catalysts disclosed in US4243554, US4243553, US4006177, US3958957, US3928000, US2490488; Mills and Steffgen, in Catalyst Rev. 8, 159 (1973)), and Schultz et al, U.S. Bureau of Mines, Rep. Invest. No. 6974 (1967). <br>
[00144]  In one embodiment, the char methanation catalyst comprises a portion of the char product (35) from the catalytic gasifier (300) which can be periodically removed from the catalytic gasifier (300) and transferred to the methanator (801), and/or trim methanator (802), as described above, or stockpiled and stored for later use in methanation processes.  <br>
[00145] Any remaining portion of the char can be processes to recover and recycle entrained catalyst compounds, as discussed below. <br>
[00146] Continuing with Figure 2, the methane-enriched second gas stream (65) can be provided to a subsequent acid gas removal unit (700), as described previously, to remove a substantial portion of H2S and CO2 from the methane-enriched second gas stream (65) and generate a gas stream (70). In various embodiments, gas stream (70) is the methane product stream (80).  In other embodiments, gas stream (70) can contain appreciable amounts of carbon monoxide and hydrogen.  In such examples, the third gas stream (70) can be provided to a methanator, e.g., a trim methanator (802), where carbon monoxide and hydrogen in the gas stream (70) can be reacted to generated methane and thereby a methane-enriched third gas stream (80).  In embodiments wherein the third gas stream (70) contains appreciable amounts of CO (e.g., greater than about 100 ppm CO), the trim methanation can be carried out using any suitable method and apparatus known to those of skill in the art, including, for example, the method and apparatus disclosed in US4235044.<br>
Additional Integrated Gasification Embodiments<br>
[00147]  As described in more detail below, in one embodiment of the invention, the gasification catalyst can comprise an alkali metal gasification catalyst.  <br>
[00148]  As described in more detail below, in certain embodiments of the carbonaceous feedstock can comprise any of a number of carbonaceous materials.  For example, in one embodiment of the invention, the carbonaceous feedstock can comprise one or more of anthracite, bituminous coal, sub-bituminous coal, lignite, petroleum coke, asphaltenes, liquid petroleum residues or biomass.  <br>
[00149]  As described in more detail below, in certain embodiments of the invention, the carbonaceous feedstock is loaded with a gasification catalyst (i.e., to form a catalyzed carbonaceous feedstock) prior to its introduction into the catalytic gasifier.  For example, the whole of the carbonaceous feedstock can be loaded with catalysts, or only part of the carbonaceous feedstock can be loaded with catalyst.  Of course, in other embodiments of the invention, the carbonaceous feedstock is not loaded with a gasification catalyst before it is introduced into the catalytic gasifier.<br>
[00150]  As described in more detail below, in certain embodiments of the invention, the carbonaceous feedstock is loaded with an amount of an alkali metal gasification catalyst sufficient to provide a ratio of alkali metal atoms to carbon atoms ranging from about 0.01 to about 0.10. <br>
[00151] In certain embodiments of the invention, the carbonaceous feedstock, gasification catalyst and superheated steam are introduced into a plurality of catalytic gasifiers.  The first gas streams emerging from the separate catalytic gasifiers can be then further treated separately, or can be recombined at any point in the downstream process.  <br>
[00152]  As the person of skill in the art will appreciate, the processes described herein can be performed, for example, as continuous processes or batch processes.  <br>
[00153]  In certain embodiments of the invention, as shown in Figures 1-3, the process is a once-through process.  In a “once-through” process, there exists no recycle of carbon-based gas into the gasifier from any of the gas streams downstream from the catalytic gasifier.  However, in other embodiments of the invention, the process can include a recycle carbon-based gas stream.  For example, to provide a balance of hydrogen and/or carbon monoxide in the catalytic gasifier during start up conditions, a methane-containing stream (taken from, e.g., a methane-enriched first gas stream, a methane-enriched second stream or a methane product stream) can be reformed in a reformer to form carbon monoxide and hydrogen, which can be admitted to the catalytic gasifier along with the carbonaceous feedstock and the gasification catalyst.  In continuous operation, however, it is desirable to operate the process as a “once-through” process. <br>
[00154]  The invention provides processes that, in certain embodiments, are capable of generating “pipeline-quality natural gas” from the catalytic gasification of a carbonaceous feedstock. A “pipeline-quality natural gas” typically refers to a natural gas that is (1) within ± 5 % of the heating value of pure methane (whose heating value is 1010 btu/ft3 under standard atmospheric conditions), (2) substantially free of water (typically a dew point of about -40°C or less), and (3) substantially free of toxic or corrosive contaminants.  In some embodiments of the invention, the methane product stream described in the above processes satisfies such requirements. <br>
[00155]  Pipeline-quality natural gas can contain gases other than methane, as long as the resulting gas mixture has a heating value that is within ± 5 % of 1010 btu/ft3 and is neither toxic nor corrosive. Therefore, a methane product stream can comprise gases whose heating value is less than that of methane and still qualify as a pipeline-quality natural gas, as long as the presence of other gases does not lower the gas stream’s heating value below 950 btu/scf (dry basis). A methane product stream can, for example, comprise up to about 4 mol% hydrogen and still serve as a pipeline-quality natural gas.  Carbon monoxide has a higher heating value than hydrogen; thus, pipeline-quality natural gas could contain even higher percentages of CO without degrading the heating value of the gas stream.  A methane product stream that is suitable for use as pipeline-quality natural gas preferably has less than about 1000 ppm CO.<br>
[00156]  In an alternative embodiment, because solid char can be generated by gasification in amounts in excess of the amount used as char methanation catalyst and because such char typically comprises quantities of unreacted carbonaceous material and entrained catalyst, a portion can be removed from the reaction chamber for sampling, purging, and/or catalyst recovery (see,, for instance, Figure 3 (1000)), as discussed below.  The term “entrained catalyst” as used herein means chemical compounds comprising an alkali metal component.  For example, “entrained catalyst” can include, but is not limited to, soluble alkali metal compounds (such as alkali carbonates, alkali hydroxides, and alkali oxides) and/or insoluble alkali compounds (such as alkali aluminosilicates).  The nature of catalyst components associated with the char extracted from a catalytic gasifier and methods for their recovery are discussed below, and in detail in previously incorporated US2007/0277437A1, US2009/0165383A1, US2009/0165382A1, US2009/0169449A1 and US2009/0169448A1.<br>
Optional Supplemental Gasification Processes<br>
(a) Catalyst Recovery <br>
[00157]  Reaction of the catalyzed carbonaceous feedstock (30) under the described conditions generally provides the first gas stream (40) and a solid char product from the catalytic gasifier.  The solid char product typically comprises quantities of unreacted carbonaceous material and entrained catalyst.  The solid char product can be removed from the reaction chamber for use as the methanation catalyst, sampling, purging, and/or catalyst recovery via a char outlet.  <br>
[00158]  The term “entrained catalyst” as used herein means chemical compounds comprising an alkali metal component.  For example, “entrained catalyst” can include, but is not limited to, soluble alkali metal compounds (such as alkali carbonates, alkali hydroxides, and alkali oxides) and/or insoluble alkali compounds (such as alkali aluminosilicates).  The nature of catalyst components associated with the char extracted from a catalytic gasifier and methods for their recovery are discussed below, and in detail in previously incorporated US2007/0277437A1, US2009/0165383A1, US2009/0165382A1, US2009/0169449A1 and US2009/0169448A1.<br>
[00159]  The solid char product can be periodically withdrawn from each of the catalytic gasifiers through a char outlet which is a lock hopper system, although other methods are known to those skilled in the art. Methods for removing solid char product are well known to those skilled in the art.  One such method taught by EP-A-0102828, for example, can be employed.  <br>
[00160]  Char from the catalytic gasifer may be passed to a catalytic recovery unit, as described below. Alternatively, such char may be passed to a catalyst recovery unit operation, as described below.  Such char may also be split into multiple streams, one of which may be passed to a catalyst recovery unit, and another which may be used as a methanation catalyst (as described above) and not treated for catalyst recovery. <br>
[00161]  In certain embodiments, the alkali metal in the entrained catalyst in the solid char product withdrawn from the reaction chamber of the catalytic gasifier can be recovered, and any unrecovered catalyst can be compensated by a catalyst make-up stream.  The more alumina and silica that is in the feedstock, the more costly it is to obtain a higher alkali metal recovery.<br>
[00162]  In one embodiment, the solid char product from the catalytic gasifier can be quenched with a recycle gas and water to extract a portion of the entrained catalyst.  The recovered catalyst can be directed to the catalyst loading processes for reuse of the alkali metal catalyst.  The depleted char can, for example, be directed to any one or more of the feedstock preparation operations for reuse in preparation of the catalyzed feedstock, combusted to power one or more steam generators (such as disclosed in previously incorporated US2009/0165376A1), or used as such in a variety of applications, for example, as an absorbent (such as disclosed in previously incorporated US2009/0217582A1).  <br>
[00163]  Other particularly useful recovery and recycling processes are described in US4459138, as well as previously incorporated US2007/0277437A1, US2009/0165383A1, US2009/0165382A1, US2009/0169449A1 and US2009/0169448A1.  Reference can be had to those documents for further process details.<br>
[00164]  The recycle of catalyst can be to one or a combination of catalyst loading processes.  For example, all of the recycled catalyst can be supplied to one catalyst loading process, while another process utilizes only makeup catalyst.  The levels of recycled versus makeup catalyst can also be controlled on an individual basis among catalyst loading processes.<br>
(b) Gas Purification<br>
[00165]  Product purification may comprise, for example, optional trace contaminant removal, ammonia removal and recovery, and sour shift processes.   The acid gas removal (supra) may be performed on the cooled first gas stream (50) passed directly from a heat exchanger, or on the cooled first gas stream that has passed through either one or more of (i) one or more of the trace contaminants removal units; (ii) one or more sour shift units; (iii) one or more ammonia recovery units and (iv) the sulfur-tolerant catalytic methanators as discussed above.  <br>
 (1) Trace Contaminant Removal<br>
[00166]  As is familiar to those skilled in the art, the contamination levels of the gas stream, e.g., cooled first gas stream (50), will depend on the nature of the carbonaceous material used for preparing the catalyzed carbonaceous feed stock.  For example, certain coals, such as Illinois #6, can have high sulfur contents, leading to higher COS contamination; and other coals, such as Powder River Basin coals, can contain significant levels of mercury which can be volatilized in the catalytic gasifier.<br>
[00167]  COS can be removed from a gas stream, e.g., the cooled first gas stream (50), for example, by COS hydrolysis (see, US3966875, US4011066, US4100256, US4482529 and US4524050), passing the cooled first gas stream through particulate limestone (see, US4173465), an acidic buffered CuSO4 solution (see, US4298584), an alkanolamine absorbent such as methyldiethanolamine, triethanolamine, dipropanolamine, or diisopropanolamine, containing tetramethylene sulfone (sulfolane, see, US3989811); or counter-current washing of the cooled first gas stream with refrigerated liquid CO2 (see, US4270937 and US4609388).  <br>
[00168]  HCN can be removed from a gas stream, e.g., the cooled first gas stream (50), by reaction with ammonium sulfide or polysulfide to generate CO2, H2S and NH3 (see, US4497784, US4505881 and US4508693), or a two stage wash with formaldehyde followed by ammonium or sodium polysulfide (see, US4572826), absorbed by water (see, US4189307), and/or decomposed by passing through alumina supported hydrolysis catalysts such as MoO3, TiO2 and/or ZrO2 (see, US4810475, US5660807 and US 5968465).<br>
[00169]  Elemental mercury can be removed from a gas stream, e.g., the cooled first gas stream (50), by absorption by carbon activated with sulfuric acid (see, US3876393), absorption by carbon impregnated with sulfur (see, US4491609), absorption by a H2S-containing amine solvent (see, US4044098), absorption by silver or gold impregnated zeolites (see, US4892567), oxidation to HgO with hydrogen peroxide and methanol (see, US5670122), oxidation with bromine or iodine containing compounds in the presence of SO2 (see, US6878358), oxidation with a H, Cl and O- containing plasma (see, US6969494), and/or oxidation by a chlorine-containing oxidizing gas (e.g., ClO, see, US7118720).<br>
[00170]  When aqueous solutions are utilized for removal of any or all of COS, HCN and/or Hg, the waste water generated in the trace contaminants removal units can be directed to a waste water treatment unit.<br>
[00171]  When present, a trace contaminant removal unit for a particular trace contaminant should remove at least a substantial portion (or substantially all) of that trace contaminant from the so-treated gas stream (e.g, cooled first gas stream (50)), typically to levels at or lower than the specification limits of the desired product stream.  Typically, a trace contaminant removal unit should remove at least 90%, or at least 95%, or at least 98%, of COS, HCN and/or mercury from a cooled first gas stream.  <br>
(2)  Sour Shift<br>
[00172]  A gas steam, e.g., the cooled first gas stream (50), also can be subjected to a water-gas shift reaction in the presence of an aqueous medium (such as steam) to convert a portion of the CO to CO2 and to increase the fraction of H2.  In certain examples, the generation of increased hydrogen content can be utilized to form a hydrogen product gas which can be separated from methane as discussed below.  In certain other examples, a sour shift process may be used to adjust the carbon monoxide:hydrogen ratio in a gas stream, e.g., the cooled first gas stream, for providing to a subsequent methanator.  The water-gas shift treatment may be performed on the cooled first gas stream passed directly from the heat exchanger or on the cooled first gas stream that has passed through a trace contaminants removal unit.<br>
[00173]  A sour shift process is described in detail, for example, in US7074373.  The process involves adding water, or using water contained in the gas, and reacting the resulting water-gas mixture adiabatically over a steam reforming catalyst.  Typical steam reforming catalysts include one or more Group VIII metals on a heat-resistant support.  <br>
[00174]  Methods and reactors for performing the sour gas shift reaction on a CO-containing gas stream are well known to those of skill in the art.  Suitable reaction conditions and suitable reactors can vary depending on the amount of CO that must be depleted from the gas stream.  In some embodiments, the sour gas shift can be performed in a single stage within a temperature range from about 100ºC, or from about 150ºC, or from about 200ºC, to about 250ºC, or to about 300ºC, or to about 350ºC.  In these embodiments, the shift reaction can be catalyzed by any suitable catalyst known to those of skill in the art.  Such catalysts include, but are not limited to, Fe2O3-based catalysts, such as Fe2O3-Cr2O3 catalysts, and other transition metal-based and transition metal oxide-based catalysts.  In other embodiments, the sour gas shift can be performed in multiple stages.  In one particular embodiment, the sour gas shift is performed in two stages.  This two-stage process uses a high-temperature sequence followed by a low-temperature sequence.  The gas temperature for the high-temperature shift reaction ranges from about 350ºC to about 1050ºC.  Typical high-temperature catalysts include, but are not limited to, iron oxide optionally combined with lesser amounts of chromium oxide.  The gas temperature for the low-temperature shift ranges from about 150ºC to about 300ºC, or from about 200ºC to about 250ºC.  Low-temperature shift catalysts include, but are not limited to, copper oxides that may be supported on zinc oxide or alumina.  Suitable methods for the sour shift process are described in previously incorporated US Patent Application Serial No.12/415,050. <br>
[00175]  Steam shifting is often carried out with heat exchangers and steam generators to permit the efficient use of heat energy.  Shift reactors employing these features are well known to those of skill in the art.  An example of a suitable shift reactor is illustrated in previously incorporated US7074373, although other designs known to those of skill in the art are also effective. Following the sour gas shift procedure, the one or more cooled second gas streams each generally contains CH4, CO2, H2, H2S, NH3, and steam. <br>
[00176]  In some embodiments, it will be desirable to remove a substantial portion of the CO from a cooled gas stream, and thus convert a substantial portion of the CO.  “Substantial” conversion in this context means conversion of a high enough percentage of the component such that a desired end product can be generated.  Typically, streams exiting the shift reactor, where a substantial portion of the CO has been converted, will have a carbon monoxide content of about 250 ppm or less CO, and more typically about 100 ppm or less CO. <br>
[00177]  In other embodiments, it will be desirable to convert only a portion of the CO so as to increase the fraction of H2 for a subsequent methanation, e.g., a trim methanation, which will typically require an H2/CO molar ratio of about 3 or greater, or greater than about 3, or about 3.2 or greater.<br>
(3) Ammonia Recovery <br>
[00178]  As is familiar to those skilled in the art, gasification of biomass and/or utilizing air as an oxygen source for the catalytic gasifier can produce significant quantities of ammonia in the product gas stream.  Optionally, the cooled first gas stream can be scrubbed by water in one or more ammonia recovery units to recovery ammonia.  The ammonia recovery treatment may be performed, for example, on the cooled second gas stream passed directly from the heat exchanger or on a gas stream, e.g., the cooled gas stream, that has passed through either one or both of (i) one or more of the trace contaminants removal units; and (ii) one or more sour shift units.  <br>
[00179]  After scrubbing, the gas stream, e.g., the cooled first gas stream, can comprise at least H2S, CO2, CO, H2 and CH4.  When the cooled gas stream has previously passed through a sour shift unit, then, after scrubbing, the gas stream can comprise at least H2S, CO2, H2 and CH4.   <br>
[00180]  Ammonia can be recovered from the scrubber water according to methods known to those skilled in the art, can typically be recovered as an aqueous solution (e.g., 20 wt%).  The waste scrubber water can be forwarded to a waste water treatment unit.<br>
[00181]  When present, an ammonia removal process should remove at least a substantial portion (and substantially all) of the ammonia from the scrubbed stream, e.g., the cooled first gas stream.  “Substantial” removal in the context of ammonia removal means removal of a high enough percentage of the component such that a desired end product can be generated.  Typically, an ammonia removal process will remove at least about 95%, or at least about 97%, of the ammonia content of a scrubbed first gas stream.<br><br>
(c) Methane Removal <br>
[00182]  The gas stream(s), e.g. the third gas stream (70), generated from the gasification of carbonaceous feedstock can be processed to separate and recover CH4 by any suitable gas separation method known to those skilled in the art including, but not limited to, cryogenic distillation and the use of molecular sieves or gas separation (e.g., ceramic) membranes.  For example, when a sour shift unit is present, a gas stream may contain methane and hydrogen which can be separated according to methods familiar to those skilled in the art.<br>
[00183]  Other gas purification methods include via the generation of methane hydrate as disclosed in previously incorporated U.S. Patent Applications Serial Nos. 12/395,330, 12/415,042 and 12/415,050.<br>
(d) Power Generation<br>
[00184]  A portion of the steam generated by the steam source (500) may be provided to one or more power generators, such as a steam turbine, to produce electricity which may be either utilized within the plant or can be sold onto the power grid.  High temperature and high pressure steam produced within the gasification process may also be provided to a steam turbine for the generation of electricity.  For example, the heat energy captured at the heat exchanger in contact with the hot first gas stream (40) can be utilized for the generation of steam which is provided to the steam turbine.<br>
(e) Waste Water Treatment<br>
[00185]  Residual contaminants in waste water resulting from any one or more of the trace removal, sour shift, ammonia removal, and/or catalyst recovery processes can be removed in a waste water treatment unit to allow recycling of the recovered water within the plant and/or disposal of the water from the plant process according to any methods known to those skilled in the art.  Such residual contaminants can comprise, for example, phenols, CO, CO2, H2S, COS, HCN, ammonia, and mercury.  For example, H2S and HCN can be removed by acidification of the waste water to a pH of about 3, treating the acidic waste water with an inert gas in a stripping column, increasing the pH to about 10 and treating the waste water a second time with an inert gas to remove ammonia (see US5236557).  H2S can be removed by treating the waste water with an oxidant in the presence of residual coke particles to convert the H2S to insoluble sulfates which may be removed by flotation or filtration (see US4478425).  Phenols can be removed by contacting the waste water with a carbonaceous char containing mono- and divalent basic inorganic compounds (e.g., the solid char product or the depleted char after catalyst recovery, supra) and adjusting the pH (see US4113615).  Phenols can also be removed by extraction with an organic solvent followed by treatment of the waste water in a stripping column (see US3972693, US4025423 and US4162902).<br>
(f) Multi-train Processes<br>
[00186]  In the processes of the invention, each process may be performed in one or more processing units.  For example, one or more catalytic gasifiers may be supplied with the carbonaceous feedstock from one or more catalyst loading and/or feedstock preparation unit operations.  Similarly, the first gas streams generated by one or more catalytic gasifiers may be processed or purified separately or via their combination at a heat exchanger, sulfur-tolerant catalytic methanator, acid gas removal unit, trim methanator, and/or methane removal unit depending on the particular system configuration, as discussed, for example, in previously incorporated US Patent Applications Ser. Nos. 12/492,467, 12/492,477, 12/492,484, 12/492,489 and 12/492,497.<br>
[00187]  In certain embodiments, the processes utilize two or more catalytic gasifiers (e.g., 2 – 4 catalytic gasifiers).  In such embodiments, the processes may contain divergent processing units (i.e., less than the total number of catalytic gasifiers) prior to the catalytic gasifiers for ultimately providing the catalyzed carbonaceous feedstock to the plurality of catalytic gasifiers and/or convergent processing units (i.e., less than the total number of catalytic gasifiers) following the catalytic gasifiers for processing the plurality of second gas streams generated by the plurality of catalytic gasifiers. <br>
[00188]  For example, the processes may utilize (i) divergent catalyst loading units to provide the catalyzed carbonaceous feedstock to the catalytic gasifiers; (ii) divergent carbonaceous materials processing units to provide a carbonaceous particulate to the catalyst loading units; (iii) convergent heat exchangers to accept a plurality of first gas streams from the catalytic gasifiers; (iv) convergent sulfur-tolerant methanators to accept a plurality of cooled first gas streams from the heat exchangers; (v) convergent acid gas removal units to accept a plurality of cooled first gas streams from the heat exchangers or methane-enriched first gas streams from the sulfur-tolerant methanators, when present; or (vi) convergent catalytic methanators or trim methanators to accept a plurality of second gas streams from acid gas removal units.  <br>
[00189]  When the systems contain convergent processing units, each of the convergent processing units can be selected to have a capacity to accept greater than a 1/n portion of the total gas stream feeding the convergent processing units, where n is the number of convergent processing units.  For example, in a process utilizing 4 catalytic gasifiers and 2 heat exchangers for accepting the 4 second gas streams from the catalytic gasifiers, the heat exchanges can be selected to have a capacity to accept greater than 1/2 of the total gas volume (e.g., 1/2 to 3/4) of the 4 second gas streams and be in communication with two or more of the catalytic gasifiers to allow for routine maintenance of the one or more of the heat exchangers without the need to shut down the entire processing system.<br>
[00190]  Similarly, when the systems contain divergent processing units, each of the divergent processing units can be selected to have a capacity to accept greater than a 1/m portion of the total feed stream supplying the convergent processing units, where m is the number of divergent processing units.  For example, in a process utilizing 2 catalyst loading units and a single carbonaceous material processing unit for providing the carbonaceous particulate to the catalyst loading units,  the catalyst loading units, each in communication with the carbonaceous material processing unit, can be selected to have a capacity to accept 1/2 to all of the total volume of carbonaceous particulate from the single carbonaceous material processing unit to allow for routine maintenance of one of the catalyst loading units without the need to shut down the entire processing system.<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1<br>
[00191]  One embodiment of the processes of the invention is illustrated in Figure 3.  Therein, a carbonaceous feedstock (10) is provided to a feedstock processing unit (100) and is converted to a carbonaceous particulate (20) having an average particle size of less than about 2500 µm.   The carbonaceous particulate (20) is provided to a catalyst loading unit (200) wherein the particulate is contacted with a solution comprising a gasification catalyst in a loading tank, the excess water removed by filtration, and the resulting wet cake dried with a drier to provide a catalyzed carbonaceous feedstock (30).  The catalyzed carbonaceous feedstock is provided to a catalytic gasifier (300).  <br>
[00192]  In the catalytic gasifier (300), the catalyzed carbonaceous feedstock (30) is contacted with a portion of superheated steam (51) from steam source (500) under conditions suitable to convert the feedstock into a first gas mixture (40) comprising at least methane, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, hydrogen, and hydrogen sulfide. The catalytic gasifier (300) generates a solid char product (35), comprising entrained catalyst, which is periodically removed from their respective reaction chambers.  This char (35) is directed to methanator (801) and used as char methanation catalyst to produce methane-enriched gas (65), (70) and/or (80) from a gaseous mixture.  Alternatively, a portion of the char (35) is directed to the catalyst recovery operation (1000) where the entrained catalyst (32) is recovered and returned to the catalyst loading operation (200).  Depleted char (33) generated by the recovery process can be directed to the feedstock processing unit (100).<br>
[00193]  Fines (15) generated in the grinding or crushing process of the feedstock processing unit (100) can be provided to the steam source for combustion.   Separately, a second portion (53) of the steam generated by the steam source (500) is directed to a steam turbine (1100) to generate electricity (11).  <br>
[00194]  The hot first gas stream (40) is provided to a heat exchanger unit (600) to generate a cooled first gas stream (50).  The cooled first gas stream (50) is provided to a sulfur-tolerant methanator (801) where the carbon monoxide and hydrogen present in the cooled first gas stream (50) are reacted in the presence of a sulfur-tolerant char methanation catalyst to generate a methane-enriched first gas stream (65) comprising methane, hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide, residual carbon monoxide and residual hydrogen.  The sulfur-tolerant char methanation catalyst is provided to the sulfur-tolerant methanator from a portion (35) of the char generated from the gasification reactor.<br>
[00195]  The methane-enriched first gas stream (65) is provided to an acid gas removal unit (700) where the hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide in the stream are removed by sequential absorption by contacting the stream with H2S and CO2 absorbers, and to ultimately generate a second gas stream (70) comprising methane, residual carbon monoxide, and residual hydrogen.  The second gas stream (70) is provided to a catalytic trim methanator (802) where the residual carbon monoxide and residual hydrogen in the second gas stream are converted to methane to generate a methane-enriched second gas stream (80).  A portion (71) of the second gas stream may be recycled for other purposes, e.g., fuel gas; the remaining portion is provided to the trim methanator (802) to generate the methane product stream (80).<br><br>
