				<td>METHODS AND APPARATUS TO COMPUTE CRC FOR MULTIPLE<br>
CODE BLOCKS IN A COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to methods and apparatus to generate cyclic<br>
redundancy checks to multiple code blocks.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
A wireless communication system generally includes multiple base stations<br>
and multiple mobile stations, while a single base station often communicates with a<br>
set of mobile stations. The transmission from a base station to a mobile station is<br>
known as downlink communication. Likewise, the transmission from a mobile<br>
station to a base station is known as uplink communication. Both base stations and<br>
mobile stations may employ multiple antennas for transmitting and receiving radio<br>
wave signals. The radio wave signal may be either Orthogonal Frequency Division<br>
Multiplexing (OFDM) signals or Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) signals.<br>
A mobile station may be either a PDA, laptop, or handheld device.<br>
In a third Generation Partnership Project long term evolution (3GPP LTE)<br>
system, when a transport block is large, the transport block is segmented into<br>
multiple code blocks so that multiple coded packets can be generated, which is<br>
advantageous because of benefits such as enabling parallel processing or pipelining<br>
implementation and flexible trade off between power consumption and hardware<br>
complexity.<br>
In a contemporary High Speed Data Shared Channel (HS-DSCH) design,<br>
only one 24-bit cyclic redundancy check (CRC) is generated for the whole transport<br>
block for the purpose of error detection for that block. If multiple code blocks are<br>
generated and transmitted in one transmission time interval (TTI), the receiver may<br>
correctly decode some of the code blocks but not the others. In that case, the<br>
receiver will feed back a non-acknowledgement (NAK) to the transmitter because<br>
the CRC for the transport block will not check.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an aspect of the present invention to provide improved methods<br>
and apparatus for generating cyclic redundancy checks for multiple code blocks in a<br>
communication system.<br>
It is another aspect of the present invention to provide an improved method<br>
and apparatus for error detection in a communication system.<br>
According to one aspect of the present invention, a method for<br>
communication is provided. A transport block CRC is calculated for a transport<br>
block including a plurality of information bit. A transport block included the<br>
transport block CRC is segmented into a plurality of subsets and a plurality of cyclic<br>
redundancy checks are calculated for the plurality of subsets.<br>
The plurality of cyclic redundancy checks and the plurality of information<br>
bits are transmitted from a first node to a second node.<br>
In response to the plurality of cyclic redundancy checks and the plurality of<br>
information bits received, the plurality of cyclic redundancy checks and the plurality<br>
of information bits are processed at the second node.<br>
The subset of information bits may be jointly encoded by a certain type of<br>
forward error correcting code, such as a turbo code.<br>
The subset of information bits and the at least one cyclic redundancy check<br>
that is calculated based on the subset of information bits may be jointly encoded.<br>
A first cyclic redundancy check may be calculated for a first subset of<br>
information bits, and a second cyclic redundancy checks may be calculated for a<br>
second subset of information bits.<br>
The first subset of information bits and the second subset of information bits<br>
may overlap with each other.<br>
Alternatively, the first subset of information bits and the second subset of<br>
information bits may be separated from each other.<br>
Still alternatively, the second subset of information bits may include the first<br>
subset of information bits.<br>
At least one cyclic redundancy check among the plurality of cyclic<br>
redundancy checks may be calculated based on all of the information bits.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, a method for<br>
communication is provided. At least one transport block of information bits are<br>
segmented into a plurality of code blocks. A plurality of code block cyclic<br>
redundancy checks are calculated for the plurality of code blocks, with at least one<br>
code block cyclic redundancy check being calculated based upon a corresponding<br>
code block. The plurality of code blocks and the plurality of code block cyclic<br>
redundancy checks are transmitted from a first node to a second node.<br>
The bits in a code block selected from the plurality of code block may be<br>
jointly encoded using a certain type of forward error correcting code. In this case, a<br>
code block cyclic redundancy check is calculated based upon the jointly coded code<br>
block.<br>
Each of the plurality of code block cyclic redundancy checks may be<br>
calculated based upon a corresponding one of the plurality of code blocks.<br>
Each of the plurality of code block cyclic redundancy checks may be<br>
calculated based upon at least the corresponding one of the plurality of code blocks.<br>
A transport block cyclic redundancy check may be calculated based on the<br>
transport block before segmenting the transport block.<br>
The plurality of code blocks may include at least one code block from which<br>
no code block cyclic redundancy check is generated.<br>
At least one code block cyclic redundancy check may be calculated based<br>
upon all of the plurality of code blocks.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is a technology to<br>
multiplex data in frequency domain. Modulation symbols are carried on frequency<br>
sub-carriers. FIG. 1 illustrates an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing<br>
(OFDM) transceiver chain. In a communication system using OFDM technology, at<br>
transmitter chain 110, control signals or data 111 is modulated by modulator 112 into<br>
a series of modulation symbols, that are subsequently serial-to-parallel converted by<br>
Serial/Parallel (S/P) converter 113. Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) unit 114<br>
is used to transfer the signals from frequency domain to time domain into a plurality<br>
of OFDM symbols. Cyclic prefix (CP) or zero prefix (ZP) is added to each OFDM<br>
symbol by CP insertion unit 116 to avoid or mitigate the impact due to multipath<br>
fading. Consequently, the signal is transmitted by transmitter (Tx) front end<br>
processing unit 117, such as an antenna (not shown), or alternatively, by fixed wire<br>
or cable. At receiver chain 120, assuming perfect time and frequency<br>
synchronization are achieved, the signal received by receiver (Rx) front end<br>
processing unit 121 is processed by CP removal unit 122. Fast Fourier Transform<br>
(FFT) unit 124 transfers the received signal from time domain to frequency domain<br>
for further processing.<br>
In a OFDM system, each OFDM symbol consists of multiple sub-carriers.<br>
Each sub-carrier within an OFDM symbol carriers a modulation symbol. FIG. 2<br>
illustrates the OFDM transmission scheme using sub-carrier 1, sub-carrier 2, and<br>
sub-carrier 3. Because each OFDM symbol has finite duration in time domain, the<br>
sub-carriers overlap with each other in frequency domain. The orthogonality is,<br>
however, maintained at the sampling frequency assuming the transmitter and the<br>
receiver has perfect frequency synchronization, as shown in FIG. 2. In the case of<br>
frequency offset due to imperfect frequency synchronization or high mobility, the<br>
orthogonality of the sub-carriers at sampling frequencies is destroyed, resulting in<br>
inter-carrier-interference (ICI).<br>
A time domain illustration of the transmitted and received OFDM symbols is<br>
shown in FIG. 3. As shown in FIG. 3,Due to multipath fading, the CP portion(CPl,<br>
CP2) of the received signal is often corrupted by the previous OFDM symbol. As<br>
long as the CP is sufficiently long, the received OFDM symbol without CP should,<br>
however, only contain its own signal convoluted by the multipath fading channel. In<br>
general, a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is taken at the receiver side to allow further<br>
processing frequency domain. The advantage of OFDM over other transmission<br>
schemes is its robustness to multipath fading. The multipath fading in time domain<br>
translates into frequency selective fading in frequency domain. With the cyclic<br>
prefix or zero prefix added, the inter-symbol-interference between adjacent OFDM<br>
symbols are avoided or largely alleviated. Moreover, because each modulation<br>
symbol is carried over a narrow bandwith, it experiences a single path fading. Simple<br>
equalization scheme can be used to combat frequency selection fading.<br>
Single carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA), which utilizes<br>
single carrier modulation and frequency domain equalization is a technique that has<br>
similar performance and complexity as those of an OFDMA system. One advantage<br>
of SC-FDMA is that the SC-FDMA signal has lower peak-to-average power ratio<br>
(PAPR) because of its inherent single carrier structure. Low PAPR normally results<br>
in high efficiency of power amplifier, which is particularly important for mobile<br>
stations in uplink transmission. SC-FDMA is selected as the uplink multiple acess<br>
scheme in 3GPP long term evolution (LTE). An example of the transceiver chain for<br>
SC-FDMA is shown in FIG. 4. At the transmitter side, the data or control signal is<br>
serial to parallel (S/P) converted by a S/P converter 401. Discrete Fourier transform<br>
(DFT) will be applied to time-domain data or control signal by a DFT transmformer<br>
402 before the time-domain data is mapped to a set of sub-carriers by a sub-carrier<br>
mapping unit 403. To ensure low PAPR, normally the DFT output in the frequency<br>
domain will be mapped to a set of contiguous sub-carriers. Then IFFT, normally<br>
with larger size than the DFT, will be applied by an IFFT transformer 404 to<br>
tranform the signal back to time domain. After parallel to serial (P/S) convertion by<br>
a P/S/ converter 405, cyclic prefix (CP) will be added by a CP insertion unit 406 to<br>
the data or the control signal before the data or the control signal is transmitted to a<br>
transmission front end processing unit 407. The processed signal with a cyclic prefix<br>
added is often referred to as a SC-FDMA block. After the signal passes through a<br>
communication channel 408, e.g., a multipath fading channel in a wireless<br>
communication system, the receiver will perform receiver front end processing by a<br>
receiver front end processing unit 409, remove the CP by a CP removal unit 410,<br>
apply FFT by a FFT transformer 412 and frequency domain equalization 413.<br>
Inverse Discrete Fourier transform (IDFT) 414 will be applied after the equalized<br>
signal is demapped in frequency domain. The output of IDFT will be passed for<br>
further time-domain processing such as demodulation and decoding after parallel to<br>
serial (P/S) converting by a P/S converter 415.<br>
In packet-based wireless data communication systems, control signals<br>
transmitted through control channels, i.e., control channel transmission, generally<br>
accompany data signals transmitted through data channels, i.e., data transmission.<br>
Control channel information, including control channel format indicator (CCFI),<br>
acknowledgement signal (ACK), packet data control channel (PDCCH) signal,<br>
carries transmission format information for the data signal, such as user ID, resource<br>
assignment information, Payload size, modulation, Hybrid Automatic Repeat-<br>
reQuest (HARQ) information, MIMO related information.<br>
Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuestion (HARQ) is widely used in<br>
communication systems to combat decoding failure and improve reliability. FIG. 5<br>
schematically shows a general Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuestion (HARQ)<br>
transceiver chain including Encoder 501, Subpacket Generator 502, Transceiver<br>
Chain 503 and Decoder 504. Each data packet is coded using certain forward error<br>
correction (FEC) scheme. Each subpacket generated in Subpacket Generator 502<br>
may only contains a portion of the coded bits. If the transmission for subpacket k<br>
fails, as indicated by a NAK in a feedback acknowledgement channel 505, a<br>
retransmission subpacket, subpacket k+1, is transmitted to help the receiver decode<br>
the packet. The retransmission subpackets may contain different coded bits than the<br>
previous subpackets. The receiver may softly combine or jointly decode all the<br>
received subpackets to improve the chance of decoding. Normally, a maximum<br>
number of transmissions is configured in consideration of both reliability, packet<br>
delay, and implementation complexity.<br>
Multiple antenna communication systems, which is often referred to as<br>
multiple input multiple output (MIMO), are widely used in wireless communication<br>
to improve system performance. In a MIMO system shown in FIG. 6, the transmitter<br>
601 has multiple antennas 602 capable of transmitting independent signals and the<br>
receiver 603 is equipped with multiple receive antennas 604. MIMO systems<br>
degenerates to single input multiple output (SIMO) if there is only one transmission<br>
antenna or if there is only one stream of data transmitted. MIMO systems<br>
degenerates to multiple input signle output (MISO) if there is only one receive<br>
antenna. MIMO systems degenerates to single input single output (SISO) if there is<br>
only one transmission antenna and one receive antenna. MIMO technology can<br>
significant increase throughput and range of the system without any increase in<br>
bandwidth or overall transmit power. In general, MIMO technology increases the<br>
spectral efficiency of a wireless communication system by exploiting the additional<br>
dimension of freedom in the space domain due to multiple antennas. There are many<br>
categories of MIMO technologies. For example, spatial multiplexing schemes<br>
increase the transmission rate by allowing multiple data streaming transmitted over<br>
multiple antennas. Transmit diversity methods such as space-time coding take<br>
advantage of spatial diversity due to multiple transmit antennas. Receiver diversity<br>
methods utilizes the spatial diversity due to multiple receive antennas. Beamforming<br>
technologies improve received signal gain and reducing interference to other users.<br>
Spatial division multiple access (SDMA) allows signal streams from or to multiple<br>
users to be transmitted over the same time-frequency resources. The receivers can<br>
separate the multiple data streams by the spatial signature of these data streams. Note<br>
these MIMO transmission techniques are not mutually exclusive. In fact, many<br>
MIMO schemes are often used in an advanced wireless systems.<br>
When the channel is favorable, e.g., the mobile speed is low, it is possible to<br>
use closed-loop MIMO scheme to improve system performance. In a closed-loop<br>
MIMO systems, the receivers feedback the channel condition and/or preferred Tx<br>
MIMO processing schemes. The transmitter utlizes this feedback information,<br>
together with other considerations such as scheduling priority, data and resource<br>
availability, to jointly optimize the transmission scheme. A popular closed loop<br>
MIMO scheme is called MIMO precoding. With precoding, the transmit data streams<br>
are pre-multiplied by a matrix before being passed on to the multiple transmit<br>
antennas. As shown in FIG. 7, assume there are Nt transmit antennas 702 and Nr<br>
receive antennas 704. Denote the channel between the Nt transmit antennas 702 and<br>
the Nr receive antennas 704 as H. Therefore H is an Nt x Nr matrix. If the transmitter<br>
701 has knowledge about H, the transmitter can choose the most advantageous<br>
transmission scheme according to H. For example, if maximizing throught is the goal,<br>
the precoding matrix can be chosen to be the right singluar matrix of H, if the<br>
knowledge of H is available at the transmitter. By doing so, the effective channel for<br>
the multiple data streams at the receiver side 703 can be diagonalized, eliminating<br>
the interference between the multiple data streams. However, the overhead required<br>
to feedback the exact value of H is often prohibitive. In order to reduce feedback<br>
overhead, a set of precoding matrices are defined to quantize the space of the<br>
possible values that H could substantiate. With the quantization, a receiver feeds<br>
back the preferred precoding scheme, normally in the form of the index of the<br>
preferred precoding matrix, the rank, and the indices of the preferred precoding<br>
vectors. The receiver may also feed back the associated CQI values for the preferred<br>
precoding scheme.<br>
Another perspective of a MIMO system is whether the multiple data streams<br>
for transmission are encoded separately or encoded together. If all the layers for<br>
transmission are encoded together, we call it a single codeword (SCW) MIMO<br>
system.<br>
In a LTE system, when a transport block is large, the transport block is<br>
segmented into multiple code blocks so that multiple coded packets can be generated,<br>
which is advantageous because of benefits such as enabling parallel processing or<br>
pipelining implementation and flexible trade off between power consumption and<br>
hardware complexity. As an example, the encoding process of the High Speed Data<br>
Shared Channel (HS-DSCH) in a High Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA)<br>
system is illustrated in the FIG. 8. In the current HS-DSCH design, only one 24-bit<br>
cyclic redundancy check (CRC) is generated for the whole transport block for the<br>
purpose of error detection for that block. If multiple code blocks are generated and<br>
transmitted in one transmission time interval (TTI), the receiver may correctly<br>
decode some of the code blocks but not the others. In that case, the receiver will<br>
feedback a non-acknowledgement (NAK) to the transmitter because the CRC for the<br>
transport block will not check. The reference number 901 to 905 shows the<br>
relationship of transport block, transport block CRC (TB CRC), and code block<br>
segmentation in FIG. 9.<br>
Assume we use an L-bit CRC pplynomial to generate the code block CRC.<br>
Denote the CRC generation polynomial by:<br>
g(x) = g0xL + g,xL'1 +--- + gL.{x + gL. (1)<br>
In general, for a message:<br>
m(x) = m0xM~l + mxxM'2 +¦•• + mM_2x + mM_x, (2)<br><br>
yields a remainder equal to 0 when divided by g(x).<br>
Note that if each bit in the message is binary, the message can be represented<br>
as a polynomial defined on binary Galois field (GF(2)). In that case, the operation of<br>
'+' and '-' is the same. In other words, if the message bits are binary, the message<br>
with CRC attached can be represented by either m{x) ¦ xL + p(x) or m(x) ¦ xL - p(x).<br>
In the rest of this invention, we assume the message bits are binary for the sake of<br>
convenience. The ideas disclosed in this invention may, however, certainly apply<br>
when the message bits are non-binary.<br>
One reason of the popularity of CRC is because of its simplicity in<br>
implementation. CRC calculation can be easily implemented by a linear feedback<br>
shift register (LFSR). LFSR can be used as a circuit for polynomial division. As<br>
shown in FIG. 10, assume an L-bit CRC is used, LFSR 1000 has L shift<br>
registers(Ro-RL-i)- Switches 1001, 1003 and 1005 are initially placed at position X.<br>
The message bit mo, m\, ..., and mM.i are fed into LFSR 1000 one at a time in an<br>
order of increasing index. After the last bit (mM.{) has been fed into LFSR 1000,<br>
switches 1001, 1003 and 1005 are moved to position Y. LFSR 1000 is shifted by<br>
another L times to produce the CRC at the output of the rightmost register. Note the<br>
LFSR in FIG. 9 is only an example. There are certainly other implementations of<br>
LFSR for polynomial division and CRC calculation.<br>
The hybrid ARQ functionality matches the number of bits at the output of the<br>
channel coder to the total number of bits of the High Speed Physical Downlink<br>
Shared Channel (HS-PDSCH) set to which the High Speed Data Shared Channel<br>
(HS-DSCH) is mapped. The hybrid ARQ functionality is controlled by the<br>
redundancy version (RV) parameters. The exact set of bits at the output of the<br>
hybrid ARQ functionality depends on the number of input bits, the number of output<br>
bits, and the RV parameters. The hybrid ARQ functionality includes two rate-<br>
matching stages 1101 and 1103, and a virtual buffer 1105 as shown in FIG. 11. The<br>
output bits of the channel coder are segmented into systematic bits, parity bits 1 and<br>
parity bits 2 by bit separation stage 1107 and are inputted to the rate-matching stages.<br>
First rate matching stage 1101 matches the number of input bits to virtual IR buffer<br>
1105, information about which is provided by higher layers. Note that, if the number<br>
of input bits does not exceed the virtual IR buffering capability, first rate-matching<br>
stage 1101 is transparent. Second rate matching stage 1103 matches the number of<br>
bits at the output of first rate matching stage 1101 to the number of physical channel<br>
bits available in the HS-PDSCH set in the TTI. The output bits of second rate<br>
matching stage 1103 are collected by a bit collection stage 1109 and are transmitted<br>
to a wireless network.<br>
The downlink subframe structure of LTE is shown in FIG. 12. In a typical<br>
configuration, each subframe is 1 ms long, containing 14 OFDM symbols as shown<br>
in a vertical axis. Assume the OFDM symbols in a subframe are indexed from 0 to<br>
13. Reference symbols (RS) for antenna 0 and 1 are located in OFDM symbols<br>
0(1201), 4(1203), 7(1205), and 11(1207). If present, reference symbols (RS) for<br>
antennas 2 and 3 are located in OFDM symbols 1(1211) and 8(1213). The control<br>
channels, including Control Channel Format Indicator (CCFI), acknowledgement<br>
channel (ACK), packet data control channel (PDCCH), are transmitted in the first<br>
one, or two, or three OFDM symbols. The number of OFDM symbols used for<br>
control channel is indicated by CCFI. For example, the control channels can occupy<br>
the first OFDM symbol, or the first two OFDM symbols, or the first three OFDM<br>
symbols. Data channels, i.e., Physical Downlink Shared Channel (PDSCH), are<br>
transmitted in other OFDM symbols.<br>
The uplink subframe structure (for data transmissions) is shown in FIG. 13.<br>
Note the LTE uplink is a SC-FDMA based system, which is very much like an<br>
OFDMA system with some differences. Similar to an OFDM symbol, each SC-<br>
FDMA block has a cyclic prefix (CP). For data transmissions, the reference signals<br>
(RSs) are located at the 4-th SC-FDMA block 1301 and the 11-th SC-FDMA block<br>
1303, while the rest of the SC-FDMA blocks carrying data. Note that FIG. 13 only<br>
shows the time-domain structure of an uplink subframe. For each individual UE, its<br>
transmission may only occupy a portion of the whole bandwidth in frequency<br>
domain. And different users and control signals are multiplexed in the frequency<br>
domain via SC-FDMA.<br>
In this invention, we propose methods and apparatus to compute multiple<br>
CRCs for a transmission to improve the reliability of the transmission and reduce the<br>
transmitter and receiver complexity.<br>
Aspects, features, and advantages of the invention are readily apparent from<br>
the following detailed description, simply by illustrating a number of particular<br>
embodiments and implementations, including the best mode contemplated for<br>
carrying out the invention. The invention is also capable of other and different<br>
embodiments, and its several details can be modified in various obvious respects, all<br>
without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, the<br>
drawings and description are to be regarded as illustrative in nature, and not as<br>
restrictive. The invention is illustrated by way of example, and not by way of<br>
limitation, in the figures of the accompanying drawings. In the following illustrations,<br>
we use data channel in LTE systems as an example. The technique illustrated here,<br>
however, can certainly be used in other channel in LTE systems, and other data,<br>
control, or other channels in other systems whenever applicable.<br>
We first illustrate the concept of transport block, code block, and code block<br>
Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC). A portion of the encoding processing chain at the<br>
transmitter side is shown in FIG. 14. Multiple transport blocks in a TTI can be<br>
serially concatenated, if necessary. If the number of bits after transport concatenation<br>
is larger than Z, which is the maximum size of a code block in question, then code<br>
block segmentation is performed after the concatenation of the transport blocks.<br>
Note that in this invention, the transport blocks may or may not contain transport<br>
block CRC before the segmentation. After the code block segmentation, CRC can be<br>
generated for some, or all, of the code blocks. After the code block CRC is attached<br>
to a corresponding code block, the channel coder encodes the code block to which<br>
the CRC is attached. The hybrid ARQ functionality matches the number of bits<br>
outputted from the channel coder to the total number of bits of the High Speed<br>
Physical Downlink Shared Channel (HS-PDSCH) set to which the High Speed Data<br>
Shared Channel (HS-DSCH) is mapped. For illustration purpose, let's assume the<br>
code block CRC is generated for every code block, although the ideas disclosed in<br>
this invention certainly apply otherwise. For ease of illustration, we assume there is<br>
only one transport block. All the embodiments in this invention apply, however, to<br>
cases with multiple transport blocks and transport block concatenation. Also note<br>
that although we often use transmitter processing to illustrate the ideas of the<br>
invention, all the embodiments in this invention apply to CRC computation at both<br>
the transmitter and the receiver.<br>
Denote the input bits to CRC computation by a0, av •••, aAA where A is<br>
the size of the transport block. We call the input bits the information bits. Again,<br>
the methods described in this invention apply regardless of whether there is one or<br>
multiple transport block or whether the transport blocks contain transport block CRC<br>
or not. Assume we use an Z,-bit CRC polynomial to generate the code block CRC.<br>
Denote the CRC generation polynomial by:<br><br><br>
where ak{x) is the polynomial presentation of the information bits up to the<br>
k-Xh. code block, including information bits in the previous code blocks. It is easy to<br>
see that a0(x) = b0(x), and flc_,(;c) = a(x). For the sake of simplicity, in the rest of the<br>
invention, these notations are used without repeated definition.<br>
In a first embodiment according to the principles of the present invention, in<br>
a transmission of a first plurality of bits with a second plurality of CRCs or in a<br>
receiving process of such a transmission, at least one CRC is computed based on a<br>
subset of bits of the first plurality of bits such that at least one bit of the first plurality<br>
of bits is not in the said subset. In an example shown in FIG. 16, a transport block<br>
CRC is generated from a transport block and a transport block 1601 including the<br>
transport block CRC is segmented code block 0 1603, code block 1 1605, code block<br>
2 1607. CBOCRC 1609 is computed based on information bits in Code Block 0<br>
1603 but not based on information bits in Code Block 1 1605 or Code Block 2 1607.<br>
In doing so, a UE can use the CB0_CRC 1609 to check whether the information bits<br>
in Code Block 0 1603 are received correctly before finishing the receiver processing<br>
for Code Block 1 1605 and Code Block 2 1607. This feature is particularly beneficial<br>
in terms of UE complexity reduction and power saving. The code block CRC can be<br>
used for purposes such as, but not limited to, providing error detection for the<br>
corresponding code block or code blocks, early stopping of iterative turbo decoding<br>
that can achieve power saving and statistical multiplexing of decoding capacity<br>
among code blocks, detecting decoding error of one code block that can avoid<br>
unnecessary decoding of other code blocks in the event of decoding error of one code<br>
block, etc.<br>
In a second embodiment according to the principles of the present invention,<br>
in a transmission of a first plurality of bits with a second plurality of CRCs or in the<br>
receiver processing of such a transmission, at least one CRC is computed based on a<br>
subset of the first plurality of bits that are jointly encoded by some type of forward<br>
error correcting code. For example, as shown in FIG. 16, CB0_CRC 1609 is<br>
computed based on the bits in Code Block 0 1603, a subset of all the bits in the<br>
transport block. The bits in Code Block 0 1603 are jointly encoded by some<br>
forward-error-correcting (FEC) code such as turbo code. FEC coding sometimes is<br>
also called channel coding. Note that CB0_CRC 1609 is normally also jointly<br>
encoded with information bits in Code Block 0 1603 to achieve error protection for<br>
both the information bits and the CRC bits. By synchronizing the block of<br>
information bits for CRC computation and the block of information bits for FEC<br>
channel coding, a UE can use the code block CRC during the decoding process and<br>
determining whether the corresponding code block is decoded correctly. And this<br>
process can be done separately for each code block with a code block CRC, either in<br>
a parallel or a pipeline and serial fashion.<br>
In a third embodiment according to the principles of the present invention, in<br>
a transmission of a first plurality of bits with a second plurality of CRCs or in the<br>
receiver processing of such a transmission, a first CRC is computed based on a first<br>
subset of bits while a second CRC is computed based on a second subset of bits. One<br>
example is shown in FIG. 16. In this example, the "subset of bits" is referred to as a<br>
code block. A transport block 1601 including the transport block CRC is computed<br>
for the transport block. Then the transport block is segmented into three code blocks.<br>
A CRC is computed for each code block. CB0_CRC 1609, which is the code block<br>
CRC attached to Code Block 0 1603, is derived based on the bits in Code Block 0;<br>
CB1_CRC 1611, which is the code block CRC attached to Code Block 1 1605, is<br>
derived based on the bits in Code Block 1; CB2CRC 1613, which is the code block<br>
CRC attached to Code Block 2 1607, is derived based on the bits in Code Block 2<br>
including the transport block CRC. Also note that, in this example, the first subset of<br>
bits from which a first CRC is derived does not overlap with the second subset of<br>
bits from which a second CRC is derived. The subsets of bits can, however,<br>
certainly overlap without departing from the disclosure of this invention. Also note<br>
that some subsets may include all the bits in the transmission. Also note that it is not<br>
necessary to compute CRCs for all the code blocks to use this invention. Some code<br>
block may not have code block CRC. Also note that a subset can also include bits in<br>
multiple code blocks. For example, as shown in FIG. 17, CBOCRC 1709 is derived<br>
based on the subset of bits that include the bits in Code Block 0 1703; CB1_CRC<br>
1711 is derived based on the subset of bits that include both the bits in Code Block 0<br>
1709 and the bits in Code Block 1 1705; CB2CRC 1713 is derived based on the<br>
subset of bits that include the bits in Code Block 0 1703, the bits in Code Block 1<br>
1705, and the bits in Code Block 2 1707.<br>
In a fourth embodiment according to the principles of the present invention,<br>
in a transmission of a first plurality of bits with a second plurality of CRCs or in the<br>
receiver processing of such a transmission, the bits upon which a first CRC is<br>
derived are a subset of bits upon which a second CRC is derived. One example is<br>
shown in FIG. 17. For the purpose of illustration, we only show three code blocks.<br>
A transport block CRC is computed for the transport block. Then a transport block<br>
1701 including the transport block CRC is segmented into three code blocks. A<br>
CRC is computed for each code block. CBOCRC 1709, which is the code block<br>
CRC attached to Code Block 0 1703, is derived based on the bits in Code Block 0;<br>
CB1_CRC 1711, which is the code block CRC attached to Code Block 1 1705, is<br>
derived based on the bits in Code Block 0 and Code Block 1; CB2_CRC 1713,<br>
which is the code block CRC attached to Code Block 2 1707, is derived based on the<br>
bits in Code Block 0 1703, Code Block 1 1705, and Code Block 2 1707. By doing so,<br>
we improve the miss detection performance of these CRCs, comparing with the<br>
CRCs derived based on a single code block. We assume the transport block is<br>
a(x) = a0xA~] + a}xA'2 +••¦ + aA_2x + aAA , where A is the transport block size. If transport<br>
block CRC (TB CRC) is used, the TB CRC is included in the message. As defined<br>
earlier, the transport block a{x) is segmented into C code blocks with code block i<br>
represented by b^x). We compute one CRC, namely CBOCRC, and attach it to the<br>
first code block. The CB0_CRC can be derived from some or all of the bits in the<br>
first code block. We denote CB0_CRC by:<br>
 (12)<br>
One example of computing CBOCRC is by finding the remainder of<br>
b0(x)-xl divided by the CRC generator polynomial g(x), in which p0(x) can be<br>
represented as:<br>
where q0(x) is the quotient of b0(x)-xL divided by g(x) . We compute<br>
another CRC, namely CB1_CRC, and attach it to the second code block. CB1_CRC<br>
can be derived from some or all of the bits in the first code block and some or all of<br>
the bits in the second code block. We denote CB1_CRC by:<br><br>
One example of computing CB1CRC is by finding the remainder of<br>
\b(j(x)-xB' + bl(x))-xL divided by the CRC generator polynomial g(x), in which px{x)<br>
can be represented as-<br>
where qx(x) is the quotient of (b0(x)-x* +bl(x))-xi divided by g(x) . By<br>
deriving CB1_CRC based on both the information bits in the first code block and the<br>
information bits in the second code block, we reduce the miss detection probability<br>
because CB1CRC can be used to detect error of information bits in the first code<br>
block and the second code block.<br>
Obviously, if there are more than two code blocks, we can extend the<br>
operations in similar ways. For example, the CRC attached to Code Block 2 can be<br>
derived from bits in Code Block 0, Code Block 1, and Code Block 2. Alternatively,<br>
the CRC attached to one code block does not need to be derived based on the bits<br>
from all of the previous code blocks, including the current code block. For example,<br>
the CRC attached to Code Block 2 can be derived from the bits in Code Block 1 and<br>
Code Block 2, but not the bits in Code Block 0. Note this embodiment also applies<br>
when there is no transport block CRC, as shown in FIG. 18. If the error detection of<br>
the CB CRC is reliably enough, TB CRC may not be needed.<br>
In a fifth embodiment according to the principles of the present invention, in<br>
a transmission of a first plurality of bits with a second plurality of CRCs or in the<br>
receiver processing of such a transmission, a transport block CRC is derived from all<br>
the bits in a transport block before the code block segmentation while there is at least<br>
one subset of bits from which no code block CRC is computed. As shown in FIG. 19,<br>
a transport block CRC is computed based on bits in the transport block. Then the<br>
transport block 1901, including the transport block CRC, is segmented into three<br>
code blocks. In this example, CBOCRC 1909 is computed based upon bits in Code<br>
Block 0 1903; CB1_CRC 1911 is computed based upon bits in Code Block 0 1903<br>
and Code Block 1 1905. Because there is a transport block CRC that covers all the<br>
bits in the transport block, code block CRC for Code Block 2, however, is not<br>
necessary. The CB0_CRC 1909 can be used for stopping turbo decoding iterations<br>
for Code Block 0 1903; the CB1_CRC 1911 can be used for stopping turbo decoding<br>
iteration for Code Block 1 1905; and the TBCRC can be used for stopping turbo<br>
decoding iteration for Code Block 2 1907. At the same time, TBCRC provide error<br>
detection for the whole transport block.<br>
In a sixth embodiment according to the principles of the present invention, in<br>
a transmission of a first plurality of information bits with a second plurality of CRCs<br>
or in the receiver processing of such a transmission, a first CRC is derived from all<br>
the information bits while a second CRC is derived from a subset of the information<br>
bits. As shown in FIG. 20, no transport block CRC is computed before code block<br>
segmentation. The transport block 2001 is segmented into three code blocks. Code<br>
block CRC is computed for each of the three code blocks. CB0_CRC 2009 is derived<br>
from the bits in Code Block 0 2003; CB1_CRC 2011 is derived from the bits in Code<br>
Block 1 2005; CB2_CRC 2013 is derived from the bits in Code Block 0 2003, Code<br>
Block 1 2005, and Code Block 2 2007. The CB0_CRC 2009 can be used for<br>
stopping turbo decoding iterations or error detection for Code Block 0 2003; the<br>
CB1CRC 2011 can be used for stopping turbo decoding iteration or error detection<br>
for Code Block 1 2005; and the CB2_CRC 2013 can be used for stopping turbo<br>
decoding iteration and error detection for Code Block 2 2007. At the same time,<br>
CB2CRC 2013 provides error detection for the whole transport block.<br>
In the following embodiments, we illustrate how linear feedback shift register<br>
(LFSR) based circuits can be used to efficiently calculate multiple CRCs for a<br>
plurality of information bits. Note that although we use the transmitter side CRC<br>
generation for illustration purpose, it is straightforward for a person of ordinary skill<br>
in the art to apply these methods to the receiver processing. For the sake of<br>
convenience, we assume the CRC calculation circuit is initialized to all-zero state.<br>
The ideas disclosed in this invention may apply, however, when the initial state of<br>
the LFSR are set to non-zero state.<br>
In a seventh embodiment according to the principles of the present invention,<br>
a first plurality of CRCs for a second plurality of information bits can be computed<br>
recursively with one single CRC calculation circuit. We compute one CRC, namely<br>
CB0_CRC, and attach it to the first code block. The CB0_CRC can be derived from<br>
some or all of the bits in the first code block. We denote CB0_CRC by<br><br>
One example of computing CB0_CRC is by finding the remainder of<br>
b0(x)-xL divided by the CRC generator polynomial g(x), in which p0(x) can be<br>
represented as:<br><br>
where q0(x) is the quotient of b0(x)-xL divided by g(x) . We compute<br>
another CRC, namely CB1_CRC, and attach it to the second code block. CB1_CRC<br>
can be derived from the bits in the first code block and the bits in the second code<br>
block. We denote CB1_CRC by<br><br>
In other words, CB1_CRC is the remainder of (b0(x)-*51 +bl(x))-xL divided by<br>
the CRC generator polynomial g(x), in which p,(x) can be represented as:<br>
where qx(x) is the quotient of [b0(x)-x* +bl(x))-xL divided by g(x) . By<br>
deriving CB1_CRC based on both the information bits in the first code block and the<br>
information bits in the second code block, we reduce the miss detection probability<br>
because CB1_CRC can be used to detect error in both the first code block and the<br>
second code block. Similarly, the CRC for the k-th code block can be computed as<br>
the remainder of ak (x) • xL divided by g(x). In other words,<br><br>
where qk{x) is the quotient of ak(x)-xL divided by g(x). Note that:<br><br>
This way of computing CRC lends itself well to a simple CRC calculation<br>
method. The CRC for the Ar-th code block can be represented as<br>
 f<br>
One example of circuit to recursively compute the CRC p,(x) ,<br>
i = 0, 1, ..., C-l is shown in FIG. 21. As shown in FIG. 21, the circuit for<br>
computing the CRC is constructed with an input port 2109 for receiving information<br>
data, an output port 2111 for outputting the information data and CRC, a linear<br>
feedback shift register (LFSR) unit 2100 communicatively connected between input<br>
port 2109 and output port 2111. LFSR unit 2100 includes L shift registers 2115, L<br>
AND gates 2113 (represented by "x" surround by a circle) and L XOR gates 2117<br>
(represented by "+" surround by a circle). A cyclic redundancy check register unit<br>
2119 is connected between input port 2109 and LFSR unit 2100. Cyclic redundancy<br>
check register unit 2119 includes L cyclic redundancy check registers. A first switch<br>
2101 is located between input port 2109 and cyclic redundancy check register unit<br>
2119. First switch has a position X to connect input port 2109 and cyclic<br>
redundancy check register unit 2119, and a position Y to disconnect input port 2109<br>
and cyclic redundancy check register unit 2119. A second switch 2103 is located at a<br>
feedback loop of LFSR unit 2100. Second switch 2103 has a position X to connect<br>
the feedback loop of LFST unit 2100, and a position Y to disconnect the feedback<br>
loop of LFST unit 2100. A third switch 2105 is located between LFST unit 2100 and<br>
cyclic redundancy check register unit 2119. Third switch 2105 has a position X to<br>
disconnect LFST unit 2100 and cyclic redundancy check register unit 2119, and a<br>
position Y to connect LFST unit 2100 and cyclic redundancy check register unit<br>
2119. A fourth switch 2107 is located between input port 2109, LFSR unit 2100 and<br>
output port 2111. Fourth switch 2107 has a position X to connect input port 2109<br>
and output port 2111, and a position Y to connect LFSR unit 2100 and output port<br>
2111. The switches can be any contemporary electronic switches such as, for<br>
example, any contemporary field effect transistors (FETs). The corresponding<br>
procedure for operating the circuit shown in FIG. 21 is outlined as follows:<br>
Initialize LFSR unit 2100 to an all-zero state; Set k = 0; Initialize the CRC<br>
registers to zero; Set all switches 2101, 2103, 2105 and 2107 at position X.<br>
Input bk(x) into the circuit, one bit at a time. Note the LFSR is also shifted<br>
once for every bit input.<br>
Change all 2101, 2103, 2105 and 2107 switches to position Y.<br>
Shift LFSR unit 2100 and the CRC registers L times to output pk{x), which<br>
is the Z-bit CRC.<br>
Reset LFSR unit 2100 to all-zero state; Change all switches to position X.<br>
Increase k.<br>
 If k <c go to step></c>
The CRC attached to the k-th code block can be represented by Equation 20:<br>
pk{x) = ak{x)-xL-qk(x)-g{x) In other words, the CRC of the k-th code block is<br>
computed based on the information bits of the k-th code block and all previous code<br>
blocks. As we can see, the calculation of the code block CRCs is the same as the<br>
calculation of the transport block CRC, except that after input each code block to the<br>
circuit, the CRC should be stored and added back at some point into the CRC<br>
calculation for the next code block. In this way, separate circuits and extra<br>
computation complexity for calculating code block CRC and transport block CRC<br>
are avoided. In fact, the last code block CRC equals to a transport block CRC. This<br>
structure fits well with the pipelining structure of the multiple code blocks. In<br>
addition, the miss detection performance of the transport block is guaranteed at the<br>
minimum. Note that Equation (20) is only for the case when the k-th code block<br>
CEC is calculated based upon the information bits of the k-th code block and all<br>
previous code blocks.<br>
Alternatively, another example of circuit to recursively compute the CRC<br>
p,(x), i = 0, 1, ..., C-l is shown in FIG. 22 according to an eighth embodiment<br>
of the principles of the present invention. As shown in FIG. 22, the circuit is<br>
constructed with an input port 2215 for receiving information data, an output port<br>
2217 for outputting the information data and CRC, a LFSR unit 2200 connected<br>
between input port 2215 and output port 2217. LFSR unit 2200 includes L shift<br>
registers. The circuit is further constructed with L state registers 2213 connected to<br>
corresponding ones of the L shift registers to write and read data values to and from<br>
the L shift registers. A first switch 2201 is located between input port 2215 and<br>
LFSR unit 2200. First switch 2201 has a position X to connect input port 2215 and<br>
LFSR unit 2200, and a position Y to disconnect input port 2215 and LFSR unit 2200.<br>
A second switch 2203 is located at a feedback loop of LFSR unit 2200. Second<br>
switch 2203 has a position X to connect the feedback loop of LFSR unit 2200, and a<br>
position Y to disconnect the feedback loop of LFSR unit 2200. A third switch 2205<br>
is located between input port 2215, LFSR unit 2200 and output port 2217. Third<br>
switch 2205 has a position X for connecting input port 2215 with output port 2217,<br>
and a position Y for connecting LFSR unit 2200 and output port 2217. This circuit<br>
achieves the same CRC computation as the circuit shown in FIG. 21. The<br>
corresponding procedure is outlined as follows:<br>
Initialize LFSR unit 2200 to all-zero state; Set k = 0; Initialize state registers<br>
2213 to zero; Set all switches 2201, 2203 and 2205 at position X.<br>
Input bk{x) into the circuit via input port 2215, one bit at a time. Note the<br>
LFSR is also shifted once for every bit input.<br>
Write the value of shift registers in LFSR unit 2200 to the corresponding state<br>
registers 2213; Change all switches 2201, 2203 and 2205 to position Y.<br>
Shift LFSR unit 2200 L times to obtain pk(x), which is the I-bit CRC.<br>
Change all switches 2201, 2203 and 2205 to position X; Write the value of<br>
state registers 2213 into the corresponding shift registers in LFSR unit 2200.<br>
Increase K.<br>
If£<c go to step></c>
Another method to compute CRCs for multiple code blocks is to use two<br>
LFSRs according to a ninth embodiment of the principles of the present invention.<br>
As shown in FIG. 23, the circuit is constructed with an input port 2311 for receiving<br>
information data, an output port 2313 for outputting the information data and cyclic<br>
redundancy checks, a first LFSR unit 2300 connected between input port 2311 and<br>
output port 2313, and including L shift registers, a second LFSR unit 2301 connected<br>
between input port 2311 and output port 2313, being in parallel with first FLSR unit<br>
2300, and comprising L shift registers. A first switch 2303 is located between input<br>
port 2311 and a common node 2317 between first and second LFSR units 2300 and<br>
2301. First switch has a position X for connecting input port 2311 with common<br>
node 2317, and a position Y for disconnecting input port 2311 with common node<br>
2317. A second switch 2305 is located at a feedback loop of first LFSR unit 2300.<br>
Second switch 2305 has a position X for connecting the feedback loop of first LFSR<br>
unit 2300, and a position Y for disconnecting the feedback loop of first LFSR unit<br>
2300. A third switch 2307 is located between input port 2311, common node 2317<br>
between first and second LFSR units 2300 and 2301, and output port 2313. Third<br>
switch 2307 has a position X for connecting input port 2311 with output port 2313, a<br>
position Y for connecting first LFSR unit 2300 and output port 2313, and a position<br>
Z for connecting second LFSR unit 2301 and output port 2313. A fourth switch<br>
2309 is located a feedback loop of second LFSR unit 2301. Fourth switch 2309 has<br>
a position X for connecting the feedback loop of second LFSR unit 2301, and a<br>
position Z for disconnecting the feedback loop of second LFSR unit 2301. This<br>
method can be outlined as follows:<br>
Initialize first LFSR unit 2300 and second LFSR unit 2301 to all-zero state;<br>
Set k = 0; Set all switches 2303, 2305, 2307 and 2309 at position X.<br>
Input bk{x) into the circuit via input port 2311, one bit at a time. Note that<br>
both first LFSR unit 2300 and second LFSR unit 2301 are also shifted once for every<br>
bit input.<br>
Change first switch 2303 to position Y.<br>
If k = C-l, go to Step 8; Otherwise, change switches 2305 and 2307 to<br>
position Y.<br>
Shift first LFSR unit 2300 L times to obtain pk(x), which is the L-bit CRC<br>
for the k-th code block.<br>
Change switches 2303, 2305 and 2307 to position X; Reset first LFSR unit<br>
2300.<br>
Increase k, go to Step 2.<br>
Change switches 2305 and 2307 to position Z.<br>
Shift second LFSR 2301 L times to obtain pc_x(x), which is the I-bit CRC<br>
for the last code block.<br>
This method computes the k-th code block CRC only based on information<br>
bits in the k-th code block, except the last code block. Therefore, the A:-th code block<br>
CRC, except the last code block CRC, can be represented by:<br>
Pk{x) = bk{x)-xL -qk{x)-g(x),fox k = 0,\,...C-2, (23)<br>
where C is the total number of code blocks. The last code block CRC is<br>
computed by LFSR2 and is derived from information bits in all the code blocks.<br>
Therefore, the last code block CRC can be represented by:<br>
pk(x) = ak(x)-xL-qk(x)-g(x), for k = C-I. (24)<br>
Another method is to insert L O's at the bit positions for all code block CRCs<br>
to the message a{x) before input a(x) to the CRC calculation circuit according to a<br>
tenth embodiment of the principles of the present invention. An example of this<br>
implementation is illustrated in FIG. 24. The circuit is constructed with an input port<br>
2407 for receiving information data, an output port 2409 for outputting the<br>
information data and CRCs, and a LFSR unit 2400 connected between input port<br>
2407 and output port 2409, and including L shift registers for transforming the<br>
information data with a cyclic redundancy check generation polynomial g(x) having<br>
a degree of L-l. A first switch 2401 is located between input port 2407 and LFSR<br>
unit 2400. First switch 2401 has a position X for connecting input port 2407 and<br>
LFSR unit 2400, and a position Y for disconnecting input port 2407 and LFSR unit<br>
2400. A second switch 2403 is located at a feedback loop of LFSR unit 2400.<br>
Second switch 2403 has a position X for connecting the feedback loop of LFSR unit<br>
2400, and a position Y for disconnection the feedback loop of LFSR unit 2400. A<br>
third switch 2405 is located between input port 2407, LFSR unit 2400 and output<br>
port 2409. Third switch 2405 has a position X for connecting input port 2407 with<br>
output port 2409, and a position Y for connecting LFSR unit 2400 and output port<br>
2409. Note that the L O's is added implicitly by changing the switches' position<br>
from X to Y for L shifts. Essentially, in this case, we allow the initial state of the<br>
LFSR to be dependant on the previous code blocks and thus enabling the current<br>
CRC to protect the bits in the current code block and previous code blocks. This<br>
method can be outlined as follows:<br>
Initialize LFSR unit 2400 to all-zero state; Set k = 0; Set all switches 2401,<br>
2403 and 2405 at position X.<br>
Input bk{x) into the circuit via input port 2407, one bit at a time. Note the<br>
LFSR is also shifted once for every bit input.<br>
Change all switches 2401, 2403 and 2405 to position Y.<br>
Shift LFSR unit 2400 L times to obtain pk(x), which is the I-bit CRC for the<br>
£-th code block.<br>
Change all switches to position X.<br>
Increase k.<br>
If k<c go to step></c>
