				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>There is disclosed a pressure vessel (1) provided with a first port (10) acting as a high pressure inlet of a first stream and a second port (11) acting as a high pressure outlet. A rotatable valve element (9) is located in the centre of the machine and includes a centre plate (19), which is utilized to separate high pressure streams. At each end of the valve element (9) are valves. The valves ensure that as the valve element (9) rotates the exchange ducts (3a and 3b) are either both isolated or that one is exposed to high pressure while the other is exposed to low pressure. In operation, a fluid stream is introduced to the machine at high pressure through port (10) and flows around the outside of the exchange duct (3b) towards the centre of the machine. The stream then flows downwardly to the valve element (9), where it then passes through the open ports of the valve element (9) and into flow distributor (6). The stream then passes into and upwardly in the exchange duct (3 a), causing upward displacement of the duct piston (4a), resulting in the pressurization and flow of the second fluid above the duct piston (4a). The second fluid then flows into the upper flow distributor (5), into the valve element (9), and then downwardly and finally between the exchange duct (3a) and out through the high pressure port (11). At the same time a fluid stream is introduced to the machine at low pressure through port (16). This flows into the valve element (9 ) and then into the flow distributor (5). From the flow distributor (5) it flows and downwardly into the pressure exchange duct (3b), causing downward displacement of duct piston (4b) and resulting in flow of the first fluid below the duct piston (4b), which then flows into the lower flow distributor (6), into the valve element (9), and then out of the lower sealing plate (8) at port (15).</td>

brine stream is no longer useful in this process as a Quid, the flow pressure energy that it contains has a high value. A pressure exchange machine is employed to recover the flow pressure energy in the brine stream and transfer it to a input saline solution stream. After transfer of the pressure energy from the brine stream, the brine is expelled at low pressure to drain by the low pressure input saline solution stream. Thus, the use of the pressure exchanger machine reduces the amount of pumping energy required to pressurize the input saline solution stream. Accordingly, pressure exchanger machines of varying designs are well known in the art.<br>
US-A-4,887,942, as modified by US-A-6,537,035, teaches a pressure exchanger machine for transfer of pressure energy from a liquid flow of one liquid system to a liquid flow of another liquid system. This pressure exchanger machine comprises a housing with an inlet and outlet duct for each liquid flow, and a cylindrical rotor arranged in the housing and adapted to rotate about its longitudinal axis. The cylindrical rotor is provided wim a number of passages or bores extending parallel to the longitudinal axis and having an opening at each end. A piston or free piston may be inserted into each bore for separation of the liquid systems. The cylindrical rotor may be driven by a rotating shaft or by forces imparted by fluid flow. Since multiple passages or bores are aligned with the inlet and outlet ducts of both liquid systems at all times the flow in both liquid systems is essentially continuous and smooth. High rotational and thus high cyclic speed of the machine can be achieved, due to the nature of the device, with a single rotating moving part, which in turn inversely reduces the volume of the passages or bores in the rotor, resulting in a compact and economical machine.<br>
US-A-3,489,159, US-A-5,306,428, US-A-5,797,429 and WO-2004/111,509 all describe an alternative arrangement for a pressure exchanger machine, which utilizes one or more fixed exchanger vessels, with various valve arrangements at each end of such vessel(s). These machines have the advantage of there being no clear limit to scaling up in size and, with the device of WO-2004/111,509, leakage between the high pressure and low-pressure streams can be mirurriized. A piston may be inserted into each exchanger vessel for separation of the liquid systems.<br>
Disadvantages of pressure exchange machines based upon US-A-4,887,942 can include:<br><br>
that for high flow rates it is necessary to increase the size of the cylindrical rotor, and there are limitations on the amount that such a rotor can be scaled up as the centrifugal forces will attempt to break apart the rotor, similar to the problems encountered in scaling up flywheels to large sizes and speeds;<br>
that very small clearances are required between the cylindrical rotor ends and the inlet and outlet ducts to maintain low rates of leakage between the high pressure and low pressure fluid systems, with such leakage causing a reduction in efficiency and it being difficult to maintain such small clearances;<br>
that when operated at relatively high rotational speeds, it may not be practical to utilize a driven shaft to control rotation of the rotor, rather by non-linear forces imparted by fluid flow which can reduce the flow range over which a given device can operate efficiently; and<br>
that when operated at relatively high rotational speeds, it may not be practical to utilize a piston in the passages in the rotor, thus reducing efficiency by increasing mixing between the two fluid streams.<br>
Disadvantages of pressure exchange machines based upon US-A-3,489,159 can include:<br>
that the flow in both fluid systems is not essentially continuous and smooth unless a large number of exchanger vessels are utilized;<br>
that these devices are generally limited to low cyclic speeds due to the linear or separated nature of the valves, thus requiring relatively large volume exchanger vessels, which increases cost and size; and<br>
that due to the multiple moving parts, these devices tend to be more complex and expensive to manufacture than devices based upon US-A-4,887,942.<br>
The present invention seeks to provide an improved pressure exchanger.<br>
According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a pressure exchanger machine for exchanging pressure in a flow stream at relatively high pressure to a second flow stream at relatively low pressure, including:<br>
a rotary valve element for directing and isolating flows;<br>
first and second exchange ducts separate from the rotary valve element; and<br>
a pressure vessel arranged to provide first and second compartments for hydraulic ally connecting high or low pressure flows to the valve element.<br><br>
Advantageously, there is provided a single valve element The provision of a single valve element reduces complexity of the exchanger while improving operability thereof.<br>
In the preferred embodiment, the valve element includes first and second valves on a common driven rotating shaft. This has the benefit that the axial hydraulic forces are substantially balanced and the two valves operate substantially synchronously.<br>
Advantageously, the machine includes fixed exchange ducts which are not part of a rotating component. This has the benefit that the machine can be scaled up in size to accommodate very high flows.<br>
Advantageously, in the preferred embodiment the machine is provided with a plurality of exchange ducts. This allows the machine to provide substantially continuous and smooth flow in both fluid systems.<br>
The exchanger is preferably provided with sealing surfaces on or adjacent to the rotating valve part, in order to reduce leakage between the different fluid systems of the machine. Such surfaces could also act as hydrodynamic bearings for radial support of the rotating vaJve part.<br>
The exchanger may be provided with one or more pistons in each exchange duct to reduce mixing between the different fluid systems.<br>
The preferred embodiments can provide a pressure exchanger machine which can be scaled up in size to accommodate Very high flow; can provide substantially continuous and smooth flow in both fluid systems; can utilize a single rotating valve element for switching flows to the exchange ducts to reduce complexity and leakage between the two fluid systems; can have relatively high rotational speed of the valve element to reduce exchange duct volume requirements; can have a driven rotating shaft on the valve element to allow a wide flow range over which the machine can operate efficiently; can have substantially balanced hydraulic forces on the valve element to reduce bearing requirements; can have minimal leakage between the high pressure and low pressure fluid systems; and can allow for optional use of piston(s) in the exchange ducts to reduce mixing between the different fluid systems; while ensuring reliability, efficiency, economy and maintainability of the machine.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of exchanging pressure between different fluid flows, including the steps of providing a<br><br>
pressure exchanger machine including a plurality of exchange ducts mounted on a non-rotating part of the machine; a rotating valve element or elements; and a pressure vessel surrounding the exchange ducts and including first and second compartments and inlet and outlet flow connections; providing for the passage of high or low pressure flows to or from the compartments through the exchange ducts by means of the valve element or elements; and adjusting the fluid flows so as to adjust the pressure exchange effected by the machine by rotating the valve element or elements while keeping the exchange ducts still.<br>

Referring first to Figure 1, a simplified embodiment of the pressure exchange machine in accordance with the present invention is generally shown.<br><br>
A pressure vessel 1 is provided with a first port 10 acting as a higb pressure inlet of a first stream ("HP1 in") and a second port 11 acting as a high pressure outlet ("HP2 out"). The pressure vessel 1, shown in more detail in Figures 2 and 2a, includes three septum plates 12-14 attached thereto. The septum plates 12 and 13 are located towards either end of the vessel 1, and the plate 14 is located towards its centre.<br>
The three septum plates 12-14 of the pressure vessel 1 are bored out in substantially' the same configuration as shown in Figure 3, which shows the section A-A of Figure 1. Figure 3 also shows the two exchange ducts 3a and 3b, which are arranged around the outer ring of the septum plates.<br>
Referring again to Figure 1, duct pistons 4a and 4b are provided in the exchanger . ducts 3a and 3b, respectively, to reduce mixing between the two fluid streams.<br>
Sealingly installed at each end of the exchange ducts 3a and 3b and on the outside of septum plates 12 and 13 are flow distributors 5 and 6, which channel the flow individually of each exchange duct 3a, 3b radially towards the centre of (he machine. The flow distributor 5 is illustrated in better detail in Figure 4, which shows the section B-B of Figure 1. The flow distributors 5, 6 have the net effect mat there is a duct to/from the end of each exchange duct 3a, 3b to/from approximately the diameter of the valve element 9, as explained in further detail below.<br>
The bottom of the pressure vessel 1 is sealed by the bottom sealing plate 8, which also incorporates port 15 for the low pressure stream outlet of the first stream ("LP1 out"). The bottom sealing plate 8 is secured and sealed to the pressure vessel I.<br>
Rotatable valve element 9 is located in the centre of the machine, that is along its longitudinal axis. Referring to Figures 5 and 5a, the valve element 9 includes a centre plate 19, which is utilized to separate high pressure streams "HP1 in" and"HP2out", and incorporates a seal on its outer perimeter, which rotatuigly seals with the inner diameter of the septum plate 14. It should be noted that in normal operation the pressure difference between the two high pressure streams is only the pressure drop in the high pressure portion of the machine, so this seal has to cope with a relatively low pressure differential.<br>
At each end of the valve element 9 are valves 20, of similar design to one another and each including two circular plates with partial circles cut out in the manner shown in Figure 5a, and with an axial seal between the plates having a butterfly shape as shown in Figure 4. The valves 20 ensure that as the valve element 9 rotates the exchange ducts 3a .<br><br>
and 3b are either both isolated, or that one is exposed to high pressure while the other is exposed to low pressure. Hie outer perimeter of the valve elements 20 are provided with seals similar to a wear ring utilized on centrifugal pump impellers.<br>
v As can be best seen in Figure 1, the top of the pressure vessel 1 is sealed with a top sealing unit or plate 7, which also incorporates port 16 for the low pressure stream inlet of the second stream ("LP2 in"). There are also provided on the unit 7 a fluid seal and thrust bearing 18 for the valve element 9 shaft, as well as means for effecting rotation of the valve element 9, such as a coupling to an electric motor. The top sealing plate 7 is secured and sealed to the pressure vessel 1.<br>
Figure 6 shows a perspective cutaway drawing of the simplified embodiment of the exchanger shown in Figure 1, serving better to illustrate the features disclosed above.<br>
In operation, the "HP1 in" fluid stream is introduced to the machine at high pressure through port 10 and flows around the outside ofthe exchange duct 3b towards the centre of the machine. The stream then flows downwardly to the valve, where it then passes through the open ports of the valve element 9 and into the flow distributor 6. The stream then passes into and upwardly in the exchange duct 3a, causing upward displacement of the duct piston 4a, resulting in the pressurization and flow of the second fluid above the duct piston 4a.<br>
The second fluid then flows into the upper flow distributor 5, into the valve element 9, and then downwardly and finally around the outside.of the exchange duct 3a and out through the.high pressure port 11, where it leaves as "HP2 out". Thus, the flow and pressure of "HP1 in" has been transferred to"HP2 out".<br>
At the same time as the above is taking place, the "LP2 in" stream is introduced to Hie machine at low pressure through port 16. This flows into the valve element 9 and then into the flow distributor 5. From the'flow distributor 5 it flows and downwardly into the exchange duct 3b. causing downward.displacement of duct piston 4b and resulting in flow of the first fluid below the duct piston 4b, which then flows into the lower flow distributor 6, into the valve element 9, and then out of the lower sealing plate 8 at port 15 for"LPl out". Thus the flow and pressure of "LP2 in" has been transferred to "LP1 out" at low pressure.<br>
As the valve element 9 rotates, first the exchange ducts 3a and 3b are both isolated at both ends, by the respective valve 20. Upon further rotation of the valve 20, the<br><br>
exchange ducts 3a and 3b are again opened to the flow, but exchange duct 3a operates at low pressure, with flow in the opposite direction, and exchange duct 3b operates at high pressure, in both cases with the flow in the opposite direction. Thus, by continued rotation, the pressure and flow of stream "HP 1 in" is intermittent, but is transferred to tiie stream "HP2 out".<br>
In operation, the pressure of stream "LP2 in" would be adjusted to ensure, as best as possible, that effectively all of stream "LP1 out" is displaced from the exchange ducts 3, by the duct pistons 4 hitting the flow distributor 6. In addition, the rotational speed of the valve element 9 would be adjusted to ensure, as best as possible, that the duct pistons 4 do not hit the flow distributor 6 before closing off, isolation and reversal of the flow.<br>
It should be noted that the axial thrust on the valve element 9 is low, provided that the pressure drops on the high and low pressure flows are low. Thus, bearing 18 is not required to oppose a large amount of thrust.<br>
The simplified embodiment described above provides a workable design, and well serves to teach the basis of the invention. However, it is preferred, in addition to the features of the simplified embodiment described above, to include one or more of the following features, which can result in a smoother operating and better balanced machine.<br>
The simplified embodiment described above incorporates valves 20 that have one segment of high pressure on one side and one segment of low pressure opposing it, which results in significant radial forces on the valves 20. To reduce such radial forces, the preferred embodiments would incorporate two segments of equal size of high pressure opposing one another, interspersed by two segments of equal size of low pressure opposing one another, as shown for the modified valve element 9' in Figures 7, 7a and 7b.<br>
The simplified embodiment described above includes two exchange ducts 3, which results in both the high pressure and low pressure flow being restricted for part of the rotation of the valve element 9. The preferred embodiments would have more than two exchange ducts 3, such that neither the high pressure or low pressure flow are restricted as the valve element 9 rotates.<br>
When utilizing the two opposing segments of both high pressure and low pressure in the valves 20 mentioned above, the preferred number of exchange ducts 3 is fifteen, as it results in exchange ducts 3 being closed and opened at different times, to result in a smoother operation, as shown in Figures 7 to 10. In these Figures the same reference<br><br>
numerals have been used to denote the equivalent components to the embodiment shown in figures 1 to 6, appropriately suffixed in the case where a component has been modified to accommodate for fifteen exchange ducts.<br>
It is to be understood that the teachings herein are not limited to the illustrations or preferred embodiments described, which are deemed to illustrate the best modes of . carrying out these teachings, and which are susceptible to modification of form, size, arrangement of parts and details of operation.<br>
The following are examples of such modifications that could be made to the preferred embodiment<br>
The high and low pressure port connection for each flow stream couid be reversed, such that stream "HP1 in", "LP1 out", "HP2 in" and "LP2 out" are connected to ports 15, 10, 16and Irrespectively.<br>
The duct pistons 4 could be eliminated, which would result in more mixing between die two fluid streams, but would have implications of lower maintenance and noise.<br>
The duct pistons 4 are shown in the preferred embodiment to be solid cylinders. Depending on the design of piping and equipment external to the machine, water hammer and/or excessive differential pressure across the duct pistons 4 could result when the pistons 4 reach the end of their stroke. To reduce this effect, the duct pistons 4 may have built into them orifices or a relief device for relieving trans-piston pressures or may be designed to enter into an area at the end of their stroke which allows bypassing of the fluid on the outside of the duct pistons 4.<br>
The exchange ducts 3 are shown in the preferred embodiment to be circular, but they may be of other cross sectional shapes, such as oval or pie-shapsd.<br>
The preferred embodiment shows the exchange ducts 3 to be all located on the same radius from the centre of the machine but this is not necessary and a more compact machine may be achieved by having exchange ducts 3 on differing radii from the centre of the machine.<br>
The preferred embodiment shows the valve element 9 as consisting of two valves 20 mounted on a common shaft. The same effect could be achieved by eliminating the common shaft and having each valve being a separate valve element with its own shaft protruding from the machine with separate but synchronized external rotating drives.<br><br><br><br><br>
