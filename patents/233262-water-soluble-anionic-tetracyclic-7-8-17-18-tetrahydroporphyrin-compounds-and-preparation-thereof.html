BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Photodynainic therapy (PDT) is a non-surgical treatment of tumors in which non-toxic drugs and non-hazardous photosensitizing irradiation are combined to generate cytotoxic reactive oxygen species in situ. This technique is more selective<br><br>
than the commonly used tumor chemotherapy and radiotherapy. To date, porphyrins have been employed as the primary photosensitizing agents in clinics. However, current sensitizers suffer from several deficiencies that limit their application, including mainly: (1) relatively weak absorption in the visible spectral range which limits the treatment to shallow tumors; (2) accumulation and long retention of the sensitizer in the patient skin, leading to prolonged (days to months) skin phototoxicity; and (3) small or even no differentiation between the PDT effect on illuminated tumor and non-tumor tissues. The drawbacks of current drugs inspired an extensive search for long wavelength absorbing second-generation sensitizers that exhibit better differentiation between their retention in tumor cells and skin or other normal tissues.<br>
In order to optimize the performance of the porphyrin drugs in therapeutics and diagnostics, seveial porphyrin derivatives have been proposed in which, for example, there is a central metal atom (other than Mg) complexed to the four pyrrole rings, and/or the peripheral substituents of the pyrrole rings are modified and/or the macrocycle is dihydrogenated to chlorophyll derivatives (chlorins) or tetrahydrogenated to bacteriochlorophyll derivatives (bacteriochlorins).<br>
Due to their intense absorption in favorable spectral regions (650-850 run) and their ready degradation after treatment, chlorophyll and bacteriochlorophyll derivatives have been identified as excellent sensitizers for PDT of tumors and to have superior properties in comparison to porphyrins, but they are less readily available and more difficult to handle.<br>
Bacteriochlorophylls are of potential advantage compared to the chlorophylls because they show intense near-infrared bands, i.e. at considerably longer wavelengths than chlorophyll derivatives.<br>
The spectra, photophysics, and photochemistry of native bacteriochlorophylls (Bchls) have made them optimal light-harvesting molecules with clear advantages over other sensitizers presently used in PDT. In particular, these molecules have a very high extinction coefficient at long wavelengths (Î»,max:=760-7SO nm, E=(4-10)x[()4 M-1'cm"1), where light penetrates deeply into tissues. They also generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) at a high quantum yield (depending on the central metal).<br>
Under normal delivery conditions, i.e. in the presence of oxygen at room temperature and under normal light conditions, the BChl moieties are labile and have somewhat lower quantum yields for triplet state formation, when compared with, e.g.,<br><br>
hematoporphyrin derivative (HPD). However, their possible initiation of biological redox reactions, favorable spectral characteristics and their ready degradation in vivo result in the potential superiority of bacteriochlorophylls over other compounds, e.g. porphyrins and chlorophylls, for PDT therapy and diagnostics and for killing of cells, viruses and bacteria in samples and in living tissue. Chemical modification of bacteriochlorophylls is expected to further improve their properties, but this has been very limited due to lack of suitable methods for the preparation of such modified bacteriochlorophylls.<br>
The biological uptake and PDT efficacy of metal-free derivatives of Bchl have been studied with the objective to manipulate the affinity of the sensitizers to the tumor cellular compartment. Cardinal to this approach is the use of highly lipophilic drugs that may increase the accumulation of the drug in the tumor cells, but also renders its delivery difficult. In addition, the reported biodistribution shows significant phototoxic drug levels in non-tumor tissues over prolonged periods (at least days) after administering the drug.<br>
In applicant's previous Israel Patent No. 102645 and corresponding EP 0584552, US 5,726,169, US 5,726,169, US 5,955,585 and US 6,147,195, a different approach was taken by the inventors. Highly efficient anti-vascular sensitizers that do not extravasate from the circulation after administration and have short lifetime in the blood were studied. It was expected that the inherent difference between vessels of normal and abnormal tissues such as tumors or other tissues that rely on neovessels, would enable relatively selective destruction of the abnormal tissue. Hence, it was aimed to synthesize Bchl derivatives that are more polar and, hence, have better chance to stay in the vascular compartment, where they convey the primary photodynamic effect. To this end, the geranylgeranyl residue at the C-17 position of Bchl a (Compound 1, depicted in Scheme 1 herein) has been replaced by various residues such as amino acids, peptides, or proteins, which enhance the sensitizer hydrophilicity. One particular derivative, Bchl-Ser (Scheme 1, Compound 13 wherein R is seryl), was found to be water-soluble and highly phototoxic in cell cultures. Following intraperitoneal injection, the Bchl-Ser cleared from the mouse blood and tissues bi-exponentially in a relatively short time (tj/2 ~2 and 16 h, respectively). Clearance from the circulation was even faster following intravenous injection. Under the selected treatment protocol (light application within minutes after drug injection), phototoxicity was predominantly conferred to the tumor vasculature (Rosenbach-<br><br>
Belkin et al., 1996; Zilberstein el al., 2001 and 1997). However, unfortunately, like native Bchl, the Bchl-Ser derivative undergoes rapid photo-oxidation, forming the corresponding 2-desvinyl-2-acetyl-chlorophyllide ester and other products.<br>
To increase the stability of the Bchl derivatives, the central Mg atom was replaced by Pd in the later applicant's PCT Publication WO 00/33833 and US 6,569,846. This heavy atom was previously shown to markedly increase the oxidation potential of the Bchl macrocycle and, at the same time, to greatly enhance the intersystem-crossing (ISC) rate of the molecule to its triplet state. The metal replacement was performed by direct incoiporation of Pd2+ ion into a Bpheid molecule, as described in WO 00/33833. Based on the pigment biodistribution and pharmacokinetics, it was assumed that the derivative Pd-Bpheid remained in the circulation for a very short time with practically no extravasation to other tissues, and is therefore a good candidate for vascular-targeting PDT that avoids skin photoloxicity. The treatment effect on the blood vessels was demonstrated by intravital microscopy of treated blood vessels and staining with Evans-Blue. Using a treatment protocol with a minimal drug-to-light interval, Pd-Bpheid (also designated Tookad) was found to be effective in the eradication of different tumors in mice, rats and other animal models and is presently entering Phase I/II clinical trials in patients with prostate cancer that failed radiation therapy (Chen et al., 2002; Schreiber et al., 2002; Koudinova et al,, 2003).<br>
Because of its low solubility in aqueous solutions, the clinical use of Pd-Bpheid requires the use of solubilizing agents such as Cremophor mat may cause side effects at high doses. It would be highly desirable to render the Pd-Bpheid water-soluble while retaining its physico-chemical properties. Alternatively, it would be desirable to prepare Bchl derivatives that are cytopjiototoxic and, .at the same time, more water-soluble than Pd-Bpheid itself. Such water solubility is expected to further enhance the drug retention in the circulation and, thereby, the aforementioned selectivity. In addition, having no need to use carriers such as detergents or lyposomes, may prevent side effects.<br>

The compounds of the invention, also referred herein sometimes by the term "pigments", present sufficient high polarity to be water soluble and injected in queous solutions with no added surfactants. In one embodiment, for the preferred .ulfonated-Pd-Bchl compound 4^ also biodistribution and pharmacokinetics are shown ind, based thereon, il is assumed that this and the other derivatives of the invention remain in the circulation, and for a very short time. Therefore they are good sensitizers for vascular-targeting PDT. Treatment of M2R melanotic melanoma and HT-29 human colon carcinoma xenografts in mice shown herein, demonstrate the selective effect of the pigment on die tumor vasculature. The suggested protocol with sulfonated-Pd-Bchl 4__considered the short clearance time of the drug. On the ground of their selective effect on the tumor vasculature, these compounds can be used for tumor as well as age-related rnacular degeneration and other tissues abnormalities that depend on neovascularization.<br>
Thus, in another aspect, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a bacteriochlorophyll derivative of the invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition comprises a bacteriochlorophyll derivative of formula I or II herein, more preferably a sulfonated derivative of formula II, most preferably the compound 4,<br>
The aniomc bacteriochlorophyll derivatives of the present invention are formulated into final pharmaceutical compositions for administration to the patient or applied to an in vitro target using techniques well-known in the art, for example, as<br><br>
summarized in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Penna., latest edition. The compositions can be administered systemically, in particular by injection, or can be used topically.<br>
The anionic Bchl compounds of the invention have similar optical absorption and photophysical characteristics as the respective non-anionic Bchls and, therefore, once residing within the treated tissue, they are expected to be efficient photodynamic agents. They can thus be useful as photosensitizers as therapeutic and diagnostic agents, for example for treatment of several cancer types such as, but not limited to, melanoma, prostate, brain, colon, ovarian, breast, skin, lung, esophagus and bladder cancers and other hormone-sensitive tumors, as well as for treatment of age-related macular degeneration, and for killing cells, viruses, fungi and bacteria in samples and living tissues as well known in the art of PDT and other photosensitizer applications.<br>
The new water-soluble Belli derivatives of the invention are useful, for example, in sensitizing neoplastic cells or other abnormal tissue to destruction by irradiation either in vivo or ex vivo using light of appropriate wavelength. It is believed that the energy of photoactivation is transferred to endogenous oxygen to convert it to singlet oxygen, and/or other reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide and hydroxyl radicals, which are considered to be responsible for the cytotoxic effect. In addition, the photoactivated forms of the Bchls fluoresce, which fluorescence can aid in localizing tumors or other sites to which the Bchl derivative is administered.<br>
Examples of indications, known in the art, that can be treated with the bacteriochlorophyll derivatives of the present invention, include destruction of tumor tissue in solid tumors and dissolution of plaques in blood vessels (see, e.g., US Patent No. 4,512,762). Particularly, these derivatives are suitable for vascular-targeted PDT because of their minimal retention in the circulation and because they are taken-up only minimally by non-circulating tissues such as skin and muscle. Thus, these compounds enable reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation limited to the interior vessels upon excitation and, thereby, cause selective response of abnormal vessels such as those present in tumors and age-related macular degeneration. In addition, the bacteriochlorophyll derivatives are useful for selective destruction in treatment of topical conditions such as acne, athlete's foot, warts, papilloma, and psoriasis, for treatment of benign prostate hypertrophy and for sterilization of biological products such as blood for transfusion, by destruction of infectious agents.<br><br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention will be administered to the patient by standard procedures used in PDT. The amount of the anionic Bchl derivative of the invention to be administered to an individual in need and the route of administration will be established according to the experience accumulated with other porphyrins used in PDT, and will vary depending on the choice of the derivative used as active ingredient, the condition, e.g. the kind of tumor, to be treated, the stage of the disease, age and health conditions of the patient, and the judgement of the physician, but will be much lower than currently used dosage of Photofrin II of about 20-40 mg HPD/kg body weight. The preferable routes of administration are intravenous or direct injection into the solid tumor of the aqueous solution of the active compound comprising conventional pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and additives, and topical treatment of skin tumors with suitable topical compositions.<br>
The wavelenght of irradiating light is preferably chosen to match the maximum absorbance of the bacteriochlorophyll photosensitizer. The suitable wavelength for any of the compounds can readily be determined from its absorption spectrum.<br>
In addition to in vivo use, the anionic Bchl derivatives of the invention can be used in the treatment of materials in vitro to kill harmful viruses or infectious agents, such as harmful bacteria. For example, blood and blood plasma to be used for future transfusion can be treated with a Bchl of the invention and irradiated to effect sterilization.<br>
The conjugation of proteins, e.g., hormones, growth factors or their derivatives, antibodies, peptides that bind specifically to target cells receptors, and of cell nutrients, e.g. tyrosine, to the Bchl moiety is meant to increase their retention in tumor and treated sites. Increasing the red shift allows for a greater depth of penetration, while keeping the ubiquity of the natural system. Replacement of the Mg by other metals is meant to optimize the intrinsic and metabolic stability of the Bchl moiety and its intersystem crossing to the excited triplet state, and also opens the possibility for new diagnostic procedures.<br>
Tumor-specific antibodies and peptides that have high affinity to neoendothelial cells will preferentially target the Bchl moieties to the tumor or treated site, while hormones and cell nutrients may also be taken up by the normal non-transformed counterparts. However, the cells selected as targets to hormones and cell nutrients, such as melanocytes and neoendothelial cells are scattered among other<br><br>
cells under normal conditions and when transformed into malignant cells, cluster into solid tumors. As a result, the concentration of the photosensitizer in the vascular and/or cellular compartments of the malignant tissue is expected to increase dramatically relative to its concentration in the normal tissue, where cells are more dispersed, assuring amplification of the PDT effect in the tumor site. This enables effective use of light doses, lower than the damaging threshold of the normal tissue, thus reducing the need for spatially well-defined irradiation. In addition, having very strong fluorescence, the site-directed Bchl can be used for fluorescence labeling of the tumor site(s) or other targets.<br>
In one most preferred embodiment of the present invention, the target for treatment with the sensitizers of the invention are abnormal blood vessels, particularly blood vessels of solid tumors and age-related macular degeneration, due to the inherent difference of sensitivity of normal and abnormal blood vessels to the suggested PDT protocols described herein.<br>
The invention further relates to a method of photodynamic therapy, which comprises administering to an individual in need an effective amount of a Bchl derivative of the invention, followed by local irradiation.<br>
In one embodiment, the PDT method of the invention is used for treatment of cancer and comprises administering to a patient afflicted with a solid tumor cancer a therapeutically effective amount of a Bchl derivative according to the invention, and then irradiating the tumor site with strong light sources at 670-780 nm.<br>
The Bchl derivatives of the invention are also useful for photodestruction of normal or malignant animal cells as well as of microorganisms in culture, enabling selective photodestruction of certain types of cells in culture or infective agents; for targeting of the porphyrin moiety to selected cells by attachment to specific polypeptides, such as hormones or other receptor ligands, to cell- or tissue-specific antibodies or to other ligands, e.g., lectins; for fluorescent labeling/tagging of molecules for analytical purposes in laboratory, diagnostic and industrial applications; and for fluorescent labeling of animal cells or microorganisms or particles for laboratory, diagnostic or industrial applications. They can replace several of the currently used fluorescence tags, such as fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) or phycoerythrine, due 10 their superior extinction coefficients and higher fluorescence yield.<br><br>
For diagnostic purposes, the Bchl derivatives of the invention may be used alone or may be labeled with a radioisotope or other detecting means as known in the art. For example, the Bchl derivative can be radioactively-labeled by standard procedures, e.g., with 67(ia, Uiln, 201T1, "mTc, and the radioactive diagnostic agent is administered to the patient, preferably by intravenous injection. After some hours, the locus of the cancer may be imaged by standard procedures.<br>
The invention further provides the use of the Bchl derivatives of the invention for ex-vivo or in vitro killing of cells or infectious agents such as bacteria, viruses, parasites and fungi in a biological product, e.g. blood, which comprises treating the infected sample with the compound of the invention followed by illumination of the sample.<br>
The invention will now be illustrated by the following non-limitative Examples.<br>

CHEMICAL EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1. Palladium 31oxo-lS-methoxycarbonylmethyl-Rhodobacteriochlorin IS'-fl-sulfoethylJamide dipotassium salt ( Compound 4)<br>
Nine hundred and thirty five (935) mg of Pd-Bpheid (3) were dissolved in a I L round bottom flask with 120 ml of DMSO while stirring under Argon (bubbled in the solution). Tauilne (1288 mg) was dissolved in 40 ml of 1M K2HP04 buffer, and<br><br>
the pH of the solution was adjusted to 8.2 (with HC1). This aqueous solution was added into the DMSO solution while stirring, and the Argon was bubbled in the solution for another 20 minutes. Then the reaction mixture was evaporated at 30Â°C for 3.5 hours under ~2 mbar and then for another 2 hours at 37Â°C to a complete dryness. The dry solids were dissolved in 300 ml of MeOH and the colored solution was filtered through cotton wool to get rid of buffer salts and taurine excess.<br>
The progress of the reaction was determined by TLC (Rf of unreacted Pd-Bpheid is 0.8-0.85 and of the reaction (aminolysis) product is 0.08-0.1) and by following the optical absorption spectrum of the reaction mixture after liophylization and resolubilization in MeOH. The absorption spectrum was characterized by a Qy transition shift from 756 run (for Pd-Bpheid) to 747 nm (for the product 4) and by Qx shift from 534 nm of Pd-Bpheid to 519 nm (of the product 4). The MeOH was evaporated and the product 4was purified by HPLC with ODS-A 250X20 SI OP u.rn column (YMC, Japan). Solvent A: 95% 0.005 M phosphate buffer, pH 8.0 and 5% MeOH. Solvent B: 100% MeOH.

II        BIOLOGICAL SECTION Materials and Methods In Vitro Studies<br>
ft) Cell Culture. M2R mouse melanoma , H5V mouse endothelial and C6 rat glioma cells were cultured as monolayers in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)/F12 containing 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), glutamine (2 mM), penicillin (0.06 rng/ml), and streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml) (hereinafter referred to as the "Culture Medium")- Cells were grown at 37Â°C in an 8% C02-humidified atmosphere<br>
(U) Phototoxicity Assay. To determine the photodynamic efficacy, cells were preincubated with increasing concentrations of the pigments in the dark for the times and conditions as indicated for the individual experiments. Unbound sensitize: was removed by washing the cells once with culture medium, and the plates were illuminated at room temperature from the bottom (Î»650 nm, 12 J/cm2). The light source was a 100W Halogen lamp (Osram, Germany) equipped with a 4-cm water filter. The cultures were placed in the culture incubator and cell survival was<br>
determined 24 h after illumination, by Neutral Red viability assay- Three kinds of controls were used: (i) light control: cells illuminated in the absence of pigments; (ii) dark control: cells treated with pigments but kept in the dark; and (iii) untreated cells that were kept in the dark.<br>
In Vivo Studies<br>
(Hi) Tumor Implantation, M2R or C6 cells (2xl06) were implanted subcutaneously<br>
on the back of the mice; tumors developed to the treatment size (6-8 mm) within 2-3<br>
weeks.<br>
(iv) Preparation of Sansitizer. Stock solutions of the compounds of the invention were prepared prior to use by dissolving the dry pigment directly in PBS to the desired concentration for injection.<br>
(v) Blodistrlbution and Pharmacokinetics. Pigment 4 of the invention (6 mg/kg body) was injected to CD1 nude mice via tail vein. Mice were sacrificed at the indicated times, and samples of the indicated organs or tissues were placed and weighed in pre-weighted vials and immediately frozen on dry ice. For examination, each sample was thawed and homogenized (1:10 w/v) in double-distilled water. Aliquots of the homogenate (0.5 ml) were lyophilized in Eppendorff test tubes. Then 0.2 ml of HNOa (70%, TraceSelect, Fluka) was added to each dry sample, incubated for 1 h at 90Â°C and diluted in double- distilled water to 10 ml. Palladium concentrations were determined by ICP-MS. Background was determined for each organ/tissue on identical samples .taken from untreated mice, and values were subtracted according}).<br>
(vi) PDT Protocol. The M2R tumor-bearing mice were anesthetized and the pigment was injected intravenously (i.v.) via the tail vein. The tumors were immediately illuminated transcutaneously for 5 min by 755 nm diode laser (CeramOptec, Germany) with light dose of either 30J/cm2 (100mW/cm2), 39J/cm2 (130mW/cm2) or 45J/cm2 (150mW/cm2). After the treatment, the mice were returned to the cage. In the dark control group, the mice were injected i.v. with sensitizer and placed in the dark cage for 24 h. In the light control group, the mice were illuminated with 45J/cm2.<br>
 (vii) Vascular Shutdown and Permeability. Mice bearing C6 glioma tumor xenografts were treated with pigment 4 (9 mg/kg) and light (100 mW/cm2 for 5 min). Immediately after treatment, Evans Blue (EB; 1% in PBS) was injected (0.5 ml, i.p.). Mice were photographed at 3 and 24 hours after treatment. The mice were sacrificed 24 hours after treatment and skin flap was made for each mouse and photographed. Then the tumor was removed with the skin above it, frozen for 1 hour at -20Â°C, and then axial slice was made and the slice was photographed. Control mice were injected with Evans Blue at the same time as the treated mice, and the protocol was continued as described above for all the mice together.<br>
Example 14. Cytopbotoxicity of the sulfonated bacteriochlorophyll derivatives against tumor ceil cultures<br>
The phototoxicity of compounds 4 and 8 was determined as described in (ii) above in M2R mouse melanoma and H5V mouse endothelial cells. Cells were preincubated with increasing concentrations of the compound for 4 hours, washed and illuminated or kept in the dark.<br>
The results are shown in Figs. 1A-1B for the bi-sulfonated compound 8 in H5V and MR2 cells, respectively, and in Figs, 2A-2B for the mono-sulfonated compound 4 (comparison) in H5V and MR2 cells, respectively. As can be seen, the phototoxicity of both pigments 4 and 8 is concentration- and light-dependent, without any dark toxicity in the tested range. The LD5o of both pigments is the same (~2 uM), and is similar in both cell lines.<br>
The phototoxicity of the sulfonated pigments 5 and 11 was determined on M2R mouse melanoma cells. As can be seen in Figs. 3 and 4, the phototoxicity of pigments 5 and n. is concentration- and light-dependent, and the LDso of both pigments is the same (~5(M). There is no dark toxicity within the tested range.<br>
Example 15. Pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of compound 4<br>
The first step before testing the phototoxicity of 4 toward PDT of solid melanoma xenogralts was to determine the pigment's pharmacokinetics and biodistribution in vivo as described in section (vi) above. As can be seen in Fig. 5, about 90% of the pigment 4 cleared within the first 10-min after i.v. injection with a monophasic kinetic pattern with a t0.s of 1.65 min (Table 4). The fast clearance of 4<br>
from the blood may imply that only a small fraction (if at all) is bound to the plasma components, otherwise clearance might have been slower.<br>
(Table Removed )<br>
Kei - rate of elimination; Vd - volume of distribution; CL - clearance. The biodistribution of the compound 4 shows that, in most of the examined organs of the mouse, the pigment levels are high immediately after injection and drop to almost background levels within 20-30 min, similar to their clearance rates from the blood (Fig. 6). These results probably represent the pigment level in the blood trapped in the organ's vasculature as seen in spleen, lung, and heart. Furthermore, the results also suggest that pigment diffusion into the organs is negligible. The pigment 4 clears rapidly from the mouse body, and within 30 min after injection it is in background levels in all tissues. The clearance rate of 4 from the mouse body is much faster than Pd-Bpheid (3), which reaches background levels only 48 hours after injection (not shown).<br>
Example 16. Photodyaamic treatment of M2R melanoma xenografts in CD1 nude mice with sulfonated pigment 4<br>
Based upon the pharmacokinetic results of Example 15 above, the treatment protocol for compound 4 was set to 5-min illumination immediately after pigment injection. In these experiments (see section (vii) above), a dedicated medical laser matched to the peak absorption of 4 (CeramOptec, Germany, 755 run) was used. In order to determine the optimal drug/light protocol, mice were treated with drug dose of 6 mg/kg and increasing the light intensity (Fig. 7). As can be seen in the Kaplan-Meier survival curve, increasing the light intensity improves the mice cure rate from 43% to 60% with 30 and 45 J/cm2, respectively. When the drug dose was elevated to<br>
9 mg/kg with light intensity of 30 J/cm2, there was a significant increase in the mice survival to 70% (Fig. 7) No dark toxicity was seen in animals treated with 6 or 9 mg/kg and kept in the dark.<br>
Example 17. Selective effect of photodynamic treatment with compound 4<br>
This experiment was carried out as described in section (vii) above. Fig. 8 illustrates the effect of photodynamic treatment on blood perfusion in C6 xenografts implanted in mice (a, e). Treated animal that was administrated with Evans-Blue immediately after PDT showed edema and enhanced vascular leakage of EB into the interstitium as demonstrated by the blue color (due to albumin-Evans Blue leakage) in the illuminated area when compared to the non-illuminated area in the same animal an to untreated animal (b, f). Twenty-four hours later, it can be seen that in the treated mice, the tumor surrounding is heavily colored blue (edema; c), while the tumor remains white (no EB color) due to vascular shutdown that occurred immediately after PDT (d). The muscle tissue under the tumor as well as the skin above and around the tumor (but within the treated area) is blue, indicating that no vascular shutdown took place (c, d). In the untreated animal, the tumor is colored blue like other tissues (g, h). The selective enclosure of new vessels in the tumor indicates that the compounds of the invention can be used for selective treatment of abnormal vasculature as in age-related macular degeneration (AMD).<br>
Example 18. PDT treatment with Compound 4 - animal model of AMD<br>
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been developed aiming at inducing localized vascular occlusion of the newly formed vascular membranes emanating from the choroid (choroidal neovascularizatiori - CNV). In age-related macular degeneration (AMD), PDT using verteporfin reduces the risk of visual loss secondary to CNV. The mechanism of action of PDT is thought to involve the release of reactive oxygen species which damage endothelial cells and activate sub endothelial clotting cascade. These events lead to the formation of thrombi within the vessel lumen.<br>
For the treatment of choroidal neovascularization, highly selective parameters (Laser power density or fluence, photosensitizer dose, and distance to light illumination (DLI)) have been developed enabling precise focusing and targeting of the pathologic vessels and minimal secondary damaging effects to healthy retina and choroid tissues. However, using the only photosensitizer (verteporfin) presently<br><br>
available for clinical use, repeated treatments are generally required to achieve the desired CNV occlusive effects. Thus, the danger for collateral tissue damage is enhanced and may become a significant side effect of treatment.<br>
In this experiment, we have evaluated the photodynamic treatment (PDT) potential of the hydrosoluble photosensitizer herein designated WST11 or compound 4, and compared its characteristics to those of verteporfin.<br>
Compound 4 is a pure and stable bacteriochlorophyll derivative isolated as a black purple crystalline powder. It has a molecular weight of 916 and is soluble in aqueous solution. It is characterized by the following properties: (a) 4 main absorption peaks (750, 530, 385 and 330 run). The strongest absorbance of light is near the infrared (Â«750nm) where tissue transmittance is the highest; (b) a very low cytotoxicity in the dark. Thus, tissue damage can be controlled by the light dose and length of exposure; (c) it is rapidly cleared from the body after administration. Therefore, potential sidn photosensitization damage on exposure to ambient light or to the sun light is minimal; (d) generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is high because of efficient intersystem crossing (ISC).<br>
The WST11 powder was diluted in endotoxin-free sterile water at a concentration of l0mg/ml, and shaken until complete dissolution. This formulation remains stable for 24 hours at 4Â°C protected from light. To calculate the volume to be injected, adjustment was made according to the rabbit weight. The appropriate volume solution was injected intravenously as a bolus via the marginal ear vein.<br>
The potential of Compound 4 for PDT of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) was compared to verteporfin (Visudyne , Novartis, Switzerland) using a rabbit eye model. Pigmented rabbits (136 "Fauve de Bourgogne" rabbits, 10-12 weeks old, 2.5-3 kg; Elevage des Pins, Epeigne-sur-Deme, France) were used. Acute and long term PDT effects on the rabbit eye were investigated for the following parameters: 1) 753nm laser fluence (25 and 50J/cm2), Compound 4 (also designated WST11) doses (2.5 and 5 mg/kg) and distance to light illumination (DLI) of 1,5,10 and 15 minutes. 2) 689 nm laser fluence (10, 50, 100 J/cm2), verteporfin doses (3, 6 and 12mg/m") and a constant DLI of 5 min. These PDT parameters encompassed an array of effects on the choroid and the overlying retina were delivered for 83 seconds to induce occlusive, subthreshold occlusive and non-occlusive vascular events. Treated rabbit eye;, were examined and followed by indirect ophthalmoscopy, fluorescein angiography (FA) and histology at various intervals after PDT. WST11<br><br>
PDT using a fluence of 50J/cm2, 5mg/kg drug dose and DLI of 1 minute induced total choroidal occlusion associated with structural lesions of the overlying RPE and retina in 100% of the treated eyes (Figs. 9A-9D). Weaker, non-occlusive PDT parameters (25J/cm2, 5mg/kg drug close and DLI of 10 minutes) did not induce choriocapillaries occlusion nor retinal lesions. Verieporfm PDT using 12mg/m2 drug dose at a fluence of 100 J/cm2 and DLI 5 minutes induced occlusive events (observed by FA) in 89% of the eyes and histology damage of the overlying retina and RPE layer in all eyes. Weaker non-occlusive verteporfm PDT parameters using 3mg/m2 drug dose, fluence 10 J/cm and DLI 5 minutes did not induce any choriocapillaries'occlusion on FA. However in these eyes definite structural damage of the retina and choroid tissues were observed on histology. Similar to verteporfm, WST11 PDT induces transient occlusion of the choriocapillaries observed up to one week after treatment. Unlike Verteporfm, WST11 PDT parameters not inducing vessel occlusion do not cause RPE or retina structural damage. Thus, despite its capacity to induce vessel obstruction, WST11 PDT does not cause damage to the RPE and overlying retina when no occlusion of the choriocapillaries takes place. The advantages of these characteristics indicates that WST1 lisa suitable candidate for PDT treatment of CNV in age-related macular degeneration.<br>
For the histology, enucleated eyes were dissected under a binocular microscope. A 4 mm biopsy punch was used to excise the full thickness of treated zones. These tissues were fixed in glutaraldehyde, processed in cacodylate buffer and embedded in plastic Semi-thin sections were obtained using a microtome and counter-stained with hematoxilin-eosin. These sections were analyzed using phase contrast microscopy. Specific sites of interest were further processed for TEM. Ultrathin sections were obtained using an ultramicrotome and counter-stained with uranyl acetate.<br>
