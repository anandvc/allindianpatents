Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to the dispensing of dry powder substances such<br>
as drugs, chemicals and toners and may be particularly suitable for dose-regulated<br>
pharmaceutical products.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
In the pharmaceutical industry, fine dry powders, particularly those intended<br>
for inhalation products can be packaged or "filled" directly into inhalers or indirectly<br>
into packages that can then be accessed by the delivery mechanisms of the inhalers at<br>
the point of use. Generally described, known single and multiple dose dry powder<br>
inhaler devices ("DPI's") use (a) individual pre-measured doses, such as capsules or<br>
blisters containing the drug, which can be inserted into the device prior to dispensing,<br>
or (b) bulk powder reservoirs which are configured to administer successive quantities<br>
of the drug to the patient via a dispensing chamber which dispenses the proper dose.<br>
See generally Prime et al., Review of Dry Powder Inhalers, 26 Adv. Drug Delivery<br>
Rev., pp. 51-58 (1997); and Hickey et al., A new millennium for inhaler technology,<br>
21 Pharm. Tech., n. 6, pp. 116-125 (1997).<br>
Thus, depending on the filling container, the filling may be carried out to<br>
generate multi-dose amounts or unit (single) dose amounts. To assure, dose<br><br>
uniformity and regulatory compliance, the powders should be filled in a manner that<br>
provides precisely meted or metered amounts so that an accurate active dose is<br>
delivered to the patient. Presently, dry particle excipients or additives are added to the<br>
active dry powder constituent(s) to attempt to allow for ease of filling. Present single<br>
or unit dose powder quantities typically range from about 10-30mg. The lower range<br>
of the filling dose amount may be limited by the filling protocols available. That is,<br>
dry powders have relatively poor flow properties making precise filling problematic.<br>
Many conventional filling methods use hoppers that have been modified to<br>
attempt to aid the flow of powder from the hopper to the target fill device. The<br>
metering of the dry powder during filling may be provided generally volumetrically,<br>
as described in US Patent No. 6,226,962, and US 6,357,490. Additional examples of<br>
volumetric metering systems are described in U.S Patent Nos. 5,865,012 and<br>
6,267,155; these volumetric metering systems propose using an oscillating filling<br>
head and/or vibration to aid powder fluidization of phannaceutically relevant<br>
quantities. Others propose injecting a gaseous medium, such as compressed air, to<br>
facilitate the filling process, such as described in U.S. Patent No. 5,727,607.<br>
However, this filling process uses gravimetric metering that is typically not feasible<br>
for pharmaceutical products that generally include reduced amounts (milligram<br>
quantities or less) of dry powder. The above-referenced patents are incorporated by<br>
reference as if recited in full herein.<br>
Many pharmaceutical dry powder formulations employ small particles in the<br>
dry powder drug mixture; these small particles can be subject to forces of<br>
agglomeration and/or cohesion (i.e., certain types of dry powders are susceptible to<br>
agglomeration, which is typically caused by particles of the drug adhering together),<br>
which can result in poor flow and non-uniform dispersion, thus inhibiting reliable<br>
filling. In addition, many of these dry powder drugs are hygroscopic in nature, a<br>
characteristic that may also inhibit reliable filling. Further, fine or low-density dry<br>
powders have a tendency to float or spontaneously aerosolize during dispensing,<br>
inhibiting a uniform flow and/or making precision meted or metered dispensing<br>
problematic. Hence, it is believed that conventional dispensing methods may have<br>
about 15-20% variability, dose to dose.<br>
Notwithstanding the above, there remains a need to provide improved and/or<br>
accurate or precise dry powder dispensers and/or dispensing systems that can reliably<br>
dispense small quantities of dry powders.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides methods, systems, apparatus and computer<br>
program products that can promote a uniform fluid-like flow of dry powders. Certain<br>
embodiments may be particularly suitable for dispensing flowable precision unit dose<br>
amounts of low-density dry powders. Other embodiments are directed to medium<br>
and/or unit density dry powders.<br>
In certain embodiments, the operations can employ non-linear vibration input<br>
energy transmitted to the dry powder during flow. The transmitted energy can be<br>
configured or generated so as to flowably dispense accurate measures of dry powder<br>
substances in a manner that inhibits or prevents aggregation, even in mass production<br>
repeat fill environments. In certain embodiments, the non-linear vibration energy is<br>
customized and comprises vibration input signals that correspond to selected<br>
frequencies associated a particular formulation or drug to promote uniform dry<br>
powder fluid flow (i.e., fluidizing the powder and/or simulating liquid flow<br>
characteristics) without aggregation. The energy input may be generated by any<br>
suitable means including, but not limited to, electrical means, mechanical means, or<br>
combinations of same. The non-linear signal can be determined experimentally using<br>
a floor of PVDF (known as KYNAR piezo-film or polyvinylidene fluoride) that<br>
applies the non-linear signal to the powder and/or by evaluating flow characteristics<br>
such as time between avalanches (measured in a rotating drum).<br>
Certain particular embodiments are directed to dispensing relatively small<br>
doses of low-density dry powders. The low-density powders may have densities that<br>
are at about or less than 0.8 g/cm3. The dose amounts may be less than about 15mg,<br>
and typically on the order of about 10µg to 10mg.<br>
In certain embodiments, the non-linear vibratory input energy comprises a<br>
plurality of predetermined frequencies that correspond to selected frequencies<br>
associated with microflow of the dry powder. The frequencies can be selected<br>
experimentally using a flow evaluation apparatus and/or using a property analysis that<br>
characterizes certain flow parameters of that particular dry powder being dispensed.<br>
Examples of microflow analysis parameters include those associated with the<br>
dynamic angle of repose or time to avalanche, a fractal analysis of mass flow, or other<br>
suitable analysis methodology known to those of skill in the art.<br>
In particular embodiments, to establish the powder-specific energy signals, a<br>
Fourier Transform power spectrum and/or phase space complexity analysis of data<br>
associated with the angle of repose and/or time to avalanche can be employed.<br>
During dispensing, the non-linear vibratory energy may be operated so that multiple<br>
frequencies are transmitted concurrently via a single superimposed (weighted)<br>
combination of selected frequencies. The transmitted energy signal may be generated<br>
as a modulated multi-frequency input signal.<br>
In certain embodiments, the energy input signal can comprise non-linear<br>
signals such as amplitude modulated signals with carrier frequencies in the range of<br>
between about 15kHz to 50kHz and a plurality of modulation frequencies in the range<br>
of between about 10-500Hz. The systems may be adjustable to generate customized<br>
non-linear signals matched to different ones of respective dry powders targeted for<br>
dispensing to thereby be able to serially dispense multiple different types of dry<br>
powders using predetermined different energy input signals.<br>
In particular embodiments, the measured unit amount of fill can be<br>
automatically carried out using a time-controlled based dispensing system as the dry<br>
powder can be flowed in a fluid-like manner so as to cause the dry powder to simulate<br>
substantially uniform fluid flow. Thus, the flow path associated with a particular<br>
dispensing port can repeatedly open and then close in a predetermined time to mete<br>
out desired quantities of the dry powder being dispensed.<br>
In other embodiments, the mass of the dry powder can be dispensed by<br>
measuring the change in an electrical parameter induced by the flexure in a<br>
piezoelectric active material positioned on a receiving member. The flexure is caused<br>
by a quantity or weight of dry powder being dispensed onto a tensioned piezoelectric<br>
material. The dispensed weight creates a change in a detectable electrical property<br>
that can be measured to determine the dispensed mass.<br>
Certain embodiments of the present invention are directed to dispensing dry<br>
powder drugs with accuracies of +/-10%, and typically about +/- 5% or less<br>
variability, dose to dose, and may be carried out with requiring vacuums to dispense<br>
the dry powder formulation.<br><br>
Other embodiments of the present invention are directed to methods and<br>
devices for increasing the bulk density without introducing cohesion or aggregation to<br>
provide a more stable fluid flow of fine low-density dry powders. Thus, certain<br>
embodiments of the dispensing systems contemplated by the present invention are<br>
directed at increasing the apparent bulk density of the dry powder by compressing<br>
portions of the powder bed in a dispensing path without evacuating the low-density<br>
dry powder material during flow dispensing and without aggregating the particles of<br>
the dry powder material.<br>
In certain embodiments, apparatus for dispensing dry powders can include: (a)<br>
an elongate flow channel having a width, length, and depth, the flow channel having<br>
axially spaced apart inlet and outlet ports, wherein the elongate flow channel is<br>
configured to extend in an angular orientation of between about 10-75 degrees relative<br>
to the axial direction of flow; (b) a flexible piezoelectric layer configured to overlie<br>
the flow channel so that, in operation, the piezoelectric layer is able to flex upwardly<br>
away from the lowermost portion of the underlying flow channel; and (c) a signal<br>
generator operatively associated with the piezoelectric layer, wherein, in operation,<br>
the signal generator is configured to output a signal for flexing the piezoelectric layer<br>
in the elongate flow channel.<br>
Certain embodiments are directed to methods of flowably dispensing dry<br>
powders from a hopper having a dispensing port and a dry powder flow path. The<br>
methods include: (a) generating a first non-linear vibration input signal, the first non-<br>
linear input signal comprising a plurality of different selected frequencies that<br>
correspond to characteristic flow frequencies of a first dry powder formulation; (b)<br>
applying the first non-linear vibration input signal to a dispensing hopper having at<br>
least one dispensing port while the first dry powder formulation is flowing<br>
therethrough; and (c) dispensing a first meted quantity of the first dry powder through<br>
the dispensing port to a receiving member.<br>
In particular embodiments, the computer program code includes a plurality of<br>
predetermined different dry powder-specific flow enhancing vibration energy outputs,<br>
each associated with a different dry powder that is flowably dispensable. The system<br>
can be configured to dispense a plurality of different dry powders separately. The<br>
control module can include computer program code that accepts user input to identify<br>
the dry powder being dispensed, and computer program code that automatically<br><br>
selectively adjusts the output of the vibration energy generation source based on the<br>
identified dry powder being dispensed.<br>
In certain embodiments, the computer program code for the predetermined dry<br>
powder-specific flow enhancing vibration energy output for the dry powder being<br>
dispensed is based on data experimentally obtained from a flow analysis of the dry<br>
powder.<br>
Other embodiments are directed to computer program products for operating a<br>
flowing dry powder dispensing system having an associated dry powder flow path<br>
with a dispensing port and a vibration energy source associated therewith to facilitate<br>
fluidic flow. The computer program product includes computer readable storage<br>
medium having computer readable program code embodied in said medium. The<br>
computer-readable program code includes: (a) computer readable program code that<br>
identifies a plurality of different powder-specific flow enhancing vibration energy<br>
signals, a respective one for each of the plurality of different dry powders, each of the<br>
flow enhancing vibration energy signals corresponding to individually predetermined<br>
flow property data of the plurality of dry powders; and (b) computer readable program<br>
code that directs the dispensing system to operate using the powder-specific vibration<br>
energy signal associated with the dry powder being dispensed as identified in the<br>
plurality of different vibration energy signals.<br>
The present invention contemplates providing systems similar to the methods,<br>
and certain systems can be described by inserting "means for" in front of the<br>
operations noted under any of the methods described above. These and other objects<br>
and/or aspects of the present invention are explained in detail in the specification set<br>

Description of Embodiments of the Invention<br>
The present invention will now be described more fully hereinafter with<br>
reference to the accompanying figures, in which embodiments of the invention are<br>
shown. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and<br>
should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Like numbers<br>
refer to like elements throughout. In the figures, certain layers, components or<br>
features may be exaggerated for clarity, and broken lines illustrate optional features or<br>
operations, unless specified otherwise. The term "meted" is used interchangeably<br>
with the term "metered." In addition, the sequence of operations (or steps) is not<br><br>
limited to the order presented in the claims unless specifically indicated otherwise.<br>
Where used, the terms "attached", "connected", "contacting", and the like, can mean<br>
either directly or indirectly, unless stated otherwise. Further, the term "hopper" is<br>
broadly used for ease of description to designate devices or a transient portion or<br>
holding portion of the flow path in a dispensing system and can include, but are not<br>
limited to, a dispensing head(S), a portion of the flow path, and/or a reservoir body<br>
and the like. The figures are not necessarily shown to scale.<br>
In the description of the present invention that follows, certain terms are<br>
employed to refer to the positional relationship of certain structures relative to other<br>
structures. As used herein, the terms "front" or "forward" and derivatives thereof<br>
refer to the general or primary direction that the dry powder travels as it is dispensed;<br>
these terms are intended to be synonymous with the term "downstream," which is<br>
often used in manufacturing or material flow environments to indicate that certain<br>
material traveling or being acted upon is farther along in that process than other<br>
material. Conversely, the terms "rearward" and "upstream" and derivatives thereof<br>
refer to the directions opposite, respectively, the forward and downstream directions.<br>
As used herein, the term "non-linear" means that the applied vibratory action<br>
or signal has an irregular shape and/or cycle, typically employing multiple<br>
superimposed frequencies and/or a vibratory frequency line shape that has varying<br>
amplitudes (peaks) and peak widths over typical standard intervals (per second,<br>
minute, etc.) over time. In contrast to conventional systems, the non-linear vibratory<br>
signal input operates without a fixed single or steady state repeating amplitude at a<br>
fixed frequency or cycle. This non-linear vibratory input can, thus, transmit a variable<br>
amplitude motion (as either a one, two and/or three-dimensional vibratory motion) to<br>
the powder.<br>
The devices and methods of the present invention may be particularly suitable<br>
to dispense discrete measured or meted quantities of dry powders, including those<br>
formulated as medicaments, and/or pharmaceutical agents for oral and/or inhalation<br>
delivery. The dry powders may be those approved, by a regulatory agency for<br>
dispensing as a pharmaceutical product, or may be dry powder used in a drug trial,<br>
drug discovery, clinical, or pre-clinical evaluation or be the subject of other<br>
commercial or non-commercial scientific, research and/or laboratory evaluation. The<br>
dry powders may include one or more active pharmaceutical constituents as well as<br>
biocompatible additives that form the desired formulation or blend.<br>
Embodiments of the invention may be particularly suitable for dispensing low-<br>
density dry powders. However, other embodiments include processing unit density<br>
and/or medium density powders. The term "low-density dry powder" means dry<br>
powders having a density of about 0.8 g/cm3 or less. In particular embodiments, the<br>
low-density powder may have a density of about 0.5 g/cm3 or less. The term "unit<br>
density dry powder" means dry powders having a density of about 1 g/cm3. The term<br>
"medium density dry powder" means dry powders having a density greater than 0.8<br>
g/cm3 and less than or equal to about 1.2 g/cm3.<br>
In certain embodiments, during dispensing, the dry powder is formulated as<br>
having substantially only one or more active pharmaceutical constituents,<br>
substantially without additives, such as excipients. As used herein, "substantially<br>
without additives" means that the dry powder is in a substantially pure active<br>
formulation with only minimal amounts of other non-biopharmacologically active<br>
ingredients. The term "minimal amounts" means that the non-active ingredients may<br>
be present, but are present in greatly reduced amounts, relative to the active<br>
ingredient(s), such that they comprise less than about 10%, and preferably less than<br>
about 5%, of the dispensed dry powder formulation, and, in certain embodiments, the<br>
non-active ingredients are present in only trace amounts.<br>
In any event, individually or unit dose dispensable quantities of dry powder<br>
formulations can be a single ingredient or a plurality of ingredients, whether active or<br>
inactive. The inactive ingredients can include additives added to enhance flowability<br>
or to facilitate aeorolization delivery to the desired systemic target. The dry powder<br>
drug formulations can include active particulate sizes that vary. The device may be<br>
particularly suitable for dry powder formulations having particulates which have<br>
particle sizes that on average are less than about 50µm, and that are typically in the<br>
range of about 0.5-50µm. In certain embodiments, the dry powder formulations have<br>
particle sizes in the range of about 0.5µm -20.0µm, and more preferably in the range<br>
of about 0.5 µm -8.0µm. The dry powder may be a respirable low-density dry<br>
powder having average particle size diameters between about 0.5-0.8 µm.<br>
The dry powder formulation can be dispensed alone or also be dispensed to<br>
include flow-enhancing ingredients, which typically have particulate sizes that may be<br><br>
larger than the active ingredient particulate sizes. In certain embodiments, the flow-<br>
enhancing ingredients can include excipients having particulate sizes on the order of<br>
about 50-100 µm. Examples of excipients include lactose and trehalose. Other types<br>
of excipients can also be employed, such as, but not limited to, sugars which are<br>
approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") as<br>
cryoprotectants (e.g., mannitol) or as solubility enhancers (e.g., cyclodextrine) or<br>
other generally recognized as safe ("GRAS") excipients.<br>
Examples of diseases, conditions or disorders that may be treated with dry<br>
powders dispensed according to embodiments of the present invention include, but are<br>
not limited to, asthma, COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), influenza,<br>
allergies, cystic fibrosis and other respiratory ailments, and diabetes and other related<br>
insulin resistance disorders. In addition, dry powder inhalant administration may be<br>
used to deliver locally acting agents such as antimicrobials, protease inhibitors, and<br>
nucleic acids/oligionucleotides as well as systemic agents such as peptides like<br>
leuprolide and proteins such as insulin. For example, inhaler-based delivery of<br>
antimicrobial agents such as antitubercular compounds, proteins such as insulin for<br>

Typical unit dose amounts of the dry powder can vary depending on the<br>
patient size, the systemic target, and the particular drug. Conventional exemplary dry<br>
powder dose amounts of inhalation drugs (with excipients) for an average adult<br>
(human) is about 10-30 mg and for an average adolescent pediatric subject is from<br>
about 5-10 mg. Exemplary dry powder drugs include, but are not limited to,<br>
albuterol, fluticasone, beclamethasone, cromolyn, terbutaline, fenoterol, ß-agonists,<br>
salmeterol, formoterol, glucocorticoids, and steroids.<br>
In certain embodiments, the administered bolus or dose can be formulated<br>
with an increase in concentration (an increased percentage of active constituents) over<br>
conventional blends. Further, the dry powder formulations may be configured as a<br>
smaller administerable dose compared to the conventional 10-25 or 30 mg doses. For<br>
example, each unit dry powder dose may be on the order of less than about 60-70% of<br>
that of conventional doses. In certain particular embodiments, the unit dry powder<br>
dose, such as those used in inhalers, an adult dose may be reduced to under about 15<br>
mg, and may be between about 10µg-10mg, typically between about 50µg-10mg. The<br>
active constituent(s) concentration may be between about 5-10%. In other<br>
embodiments, active constituent concentrations can be in the range of between about<br>
10-20%, 20-50%, or even larger. In particular embodiments, such as for nasal<br>
inhalation, target dose amounts may be between about 12-100µg.<br>
Turning now to Figure 1A, a portion of a dispensing system 10 is shown. The<br>
system 10 comprises a dispensing hopper 25 with a dispensing port 25p. A quantity<br>
of a dry powder 15 can be disposed in the hopper 25 for dispensing. As used herein,<br>
the term "dry powder" is used interchangeably with "dry powder formulation" and<br>
means the dry powder can comprise one or a plurality of constituents or ingredients<br>
with one or a plurality of (average) particulate size ranges. The dry powder may be a<br>
dry powder with cohesive or agglomeration tendencies. As is also shown, the<br>
dispensing system 10 also comprises a non-linear signal generator 20 that is operably<br>
associated with the hopper 25. The non-linear signal generator 20 is configured to<br>
generate a vibratory signal 20s that facilitates the flowable dispensing of the dry<br>
powder 15. The hopper 25 and port 25p define a flow path for the dry powder 15.<br>
An axis 25a extends vertically axially through the port and hopper, 25p, 25,<br>
respectively. The system 10 may include a valve 25v operably associated with the<br>
port 25p to controllably and/or selectively open and close the port 25p (and, thus, the<br>
dry powder flow path) during operation.<br>
As shown, the signal generator 20 may be operably associated with a control<br>
module 21. The signal generator 20 may be configured to transmit the vibratory<br>
energy either locally to a limited site (shown as position "A" with lateral arrows<br>
representing lateral movement) or distributed along a major portion of the length of<br>
the hopper 25 (shown by space "B" with a plurality of distributed arrows along a<br>
portion of the wall 25w of the hopper 25).<br><br>
Figure 1B illustrates examples of operations that may be used to dispense dry<br>
powder according to embodiments of the present invention. A powder-specific dry<br>
powder vibratory energy signal can be generated (block 100) (corresponding to the<br>
particular dry powder being currently dispensed). The system can be configured to<br>
generate multiple different signals (block 115), and, as such, the signal generator can<br>
be adjusted to output the particular signal corresponding to the dry powder then being<br>
dispensed. The powder specific vibratory signal may be a non-linear signal<br>
comprising a plurality of selected frequencies (block 110). The non- linear signal can<br>
fiuidize the powder in such a way that a powder "flow resonance" is generated<br>
allowing precision flowable dispensing and/or reducing, inhibiting and/or preventing<br>
agglomeration.<br>
In particular embodiments the signal generator 20 can include a transducer<br>
that is driven by an amplifier to provide the vibratory input The transducer can be<br>
driven to have relatively small amplitude output such as about 100 mm or less,<br>
typically less than 10 mm, and in certain embodiments, about 1mm or less. In other<br>
embodiments, the signal generator 20 can be configured to force the hopper or other<br>
portion of the flow path (whether wall, outer perimeter of the device itself or other<br>
component which transmits the vibratory energy to the dry powder) to move, deflect<br>
and/or vibrate with relatively small amplitudes of less than about 1 mm. In certain<br>
embodiments of systems that employ at least one transducer, the transducer may be<br>
driven with low energy such as less than about 100 mW.<br>
In particular embodiments, the signal can be configured to generate a<br>
downwardly oriented force vector on the dry powder during flow that can increase the<br>
apparent bulk density of the dry powder to simulate or cause the dry powder to flow<br>
in a substantially uniform fluid-like manner.<br>
Again referring to Figure 1B, successive meted quantities of dry powder can<br>
be dispensed using the corresponding powder-specific signal (block 120). The<br>
successive quantities of dry powder can be captured in a desired receiving member<br>
(block 130). The vibratory signal may be a low energy signal. In the past, other<br>
attempts for fluidization use either airflow or vibration with linear frequencies that<br>
may cause aggregation. For example, in the past, others have proposed uniform<br>
frequency systems (using vibrating orifices, ultrasonic systems, and the like) to<br>
generate sinusoidal, square, or other uniform (period/cycle) signals.<br><br>
The powder can be dispensed into suitable receiving members, whether bulk<br>
reservoirs, unit dose blister packages or capsules, and the like. The dry powder can be<br>
a low-density pharmacologically active dry powder (block 122). The meted quantity<br>
can be unit dose amounts of less than about 15mg, with a dose-to-dose variability of<br>
less than about 5-10% (block 124). In certain embodiments, the variability can be<br>
less than about 2%. The amount of dispensed dry powder can be dispensed in a time-<br>
controlled manner (block 131) rather than requiring volumetric dispensing as with<br>
conventional protocols.<br>
Figure 1C illustrates one method of controllably filling meted amounts of<br>
low-density dry powder. The dry powder flows through a dispensing port (block 160)<br>
and the dispensing port is selectively opened and closed at predetermined times to<br>
control the amount of time the flow path is open and, thus, the amount of dry powder<br>
dispensed (block 165). The dispensing port may be configured to yield unit dose<br>
amounts of less than about 15mg (block 166). The time-controlled dispensing port<br>
may be operated to yield precision-meted amounts of dry powder in doses under<br>
10mg, and in certain embodiments between about l0µg-lmg. The term "precision"<br>
means less than about 5% variation from a planned dose amount, and/or dose to dose,<br>
and may be less than about 2% variation.<br>
The dispensing head may be held in a static position with respect to an<br>
underlying dispensing location. As such, the underlying receiving member may be on<br>
a moving surface (such as a conveyor with a controlled conveyor speed) that causes a<br>
different receiving member or location to be placed under the dispensing port at each<br>
open interval for successive automated filling. In other embodiments, the dispensing<br>
port can be placed on a moveable head with the receiving member(s) static, and the<br>
head can be translated to overlie different receiving regions at different dispensing<br>
times.<br>
Figures 2A-2C illustrate three different dry powders 151, 152,153, each of<br>
which can be analyzed and/or characterized (20ch1, 20ch2, 20ch3, respectively).<br>
Custom or corresponding individual (non-linear) input signals with frequencies<br>
selected from the corresponding characterization that are specifically targeted to that<br>
dry powder to facilitate fluidic flow during dispensing can be determined for each dry<br>
powder 151, 152, 153. The drug-specific signals are shown by the signals 20s1-20s3.<br>
The signal generator 20 (Figure 1A) may be programmed with a plurality of<br>
predetermined different signals 20s, or if a manufacturing apparatus dispenses only a<br>
single dry powder, the signal generator 20 may be programmed with a single signal<br>
20s. Appropriate powder-specific signals can be determined experimentally and/or<br>
computationally at an OEM or evaluation site and forwarded to be input onto<br>
dispensing systems at selective use sites (via computer program code that direct the<br>
generation of the fluidic flow promoter signal).<br>
Figures 3A-3E illustrate an example of operations that may be carried out to<br>
generate a dry powder-specific signal. A microflow analysis of the dry powder to be<br>
dispensed can be performed to assess avalanching flow profiles and/or other suitable<br>
mass/time flow profiles. The.analysis can be carried out to select predominant<br>
oscillatory frequencies for a particular dry powder that, when applied to the powder<br>
during flowable dispensing, can promote uniform mass flow to achieve a fluid-like<br>
flow, even for low-density dry powders.<br>

al., Controlling Chaos, Phys. Rev. Lett. 64: 1196-1199 (1990), the contents of each of<br>
these articles are also incorporated by reference as if recited in full herein. Using the<br>
principals and relationships described in one or more of these articles with signals<br>
derived from analyses of mass flow and/or microflow, one can determine custom<br>
powder specific signals that may be able to achieve uniformly flowing dry powders.<br><br>
As shown in Figure 3A, the time between avalanches, for a particular dry<br>
powder of interest, may be evaluated experimentally using a rotating drum. This time<br>
information may be converted to frequency space (frequency domain) as shown in<br>
Figure 3B. Figure 3C illustrates that a distribution of frequencies 20f can be<br>
determined (computationally or via computer models). Then, a desired number of<br>
selected frequencies can be identified. The frequencies selected may span a desired<br>
statistically significant percentage of the distribution or be the frequencies most<br>
observed in the analysis spectrum. The term "most observed" means those<br>
frequencies occurring the greatest number of times in the distribution. For example,<br>
the number of different frequencies selected may be at least the three most observed<br>
different frequencies and/or sufficient frequencies to represent at least about 50% of<br>
the distribution. In certain embodiments, the number can be at least about 5, and<br>
typically about 6, or a number sufficient to represent at least about 75% of the<br>
frequency distribution. To select the number, two, three or four or more of the most<br>
observed frequencies can be used to form the vibration signal. The results can be<br>
analyzed experimentally and additional frequencies may be added to the combined<br>
non-linear signal to improve fluidic flow performance.<br>
Figure 3D illustrates that six of the most observed frequencies 20f1- 20f6, in<br>
the distribution plot 20f can be selected. Figure 3E illustrates that the selected<br>
frequencies can be superimposed to generate a single superposition signal (that may<br>
also include weighted amplitudes for certain of the selected frequencies or<br>
adjustments of relative amplitudes according to the observed frequency distribution).<br>
Thus, Figure 3E illustrates a derived non-linear oscillatory or vibratory energy signal<br>
that may be used to dispense a particular dry powder.<br>
Referring again to Figure 3D, the signal can be created digitally by computer<br>
code means employing mathematical or numerical computation techniques and<br>
relevant equations. For example, for a signal 20s having representative frequencies<br>
"f1-n," the cumulative signal x signal (20s, Figure 3D) can be generated include a<br>
plurality of signal components, xf1-xfn (shown as 20f1-20fn in Figure 3D) at each<br>
desired frequency, fn, each component having an amplitude "a" at its frequency as<br>
described below. Using the spectrum shown in Figure 3D noting that the most<br>
observed frequency in Figure 3D is 20f3, the following equations may be used to<br>
generate the non-linear signal.<br><br>
For an index, "n" ranging from 0-15,999, used to generate the digital signal:<br>
n= [0:15999] Equation (1)<br>
xf3= sin (2pn/16000) Equation (2)<br>
xf2=af2 sin (2pn (f2)/l6000(f3)) Equation (3)<br>
xf4= af4 sin (27pn (f4)/16000(f3)) Equation (4)<br>
This evaluation can be continued for a desired number of frequencies to render<br>
a representation of a sufficient number of frequencies /spanning a sufficient portion of<br>
the spectrum. The powder-specific, non-linear signal can be generated by summing<br>
the selected individual frequency components.<br>
Xsignal =xf3 + xf4c + xf4.... Equation (5)<br>
In certain embodiments, the overall power in the signal, xSignal, can be<br>
increased by adding a phase shift to one or more of the summed components. For<br>
example, for component xf2, the associated signal contribution can be adjusted by the<br>
following equation:<br>
xf2=af2 sin (2pn (f2)/16000(f3) + mp/nf) Equation (6)<br>
Where "m" is the number at this frequency and nf is the total number of<br>
frequencies contained in the signal.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates an example of an amplitude-modified vibratory signal of a<br>
dry powder that can include a kHz carrier frequency (such as between about 5kHz-<br>
50kHz) modified by low modulating frequencies (typically between about 10-200Hz)<br>
that may be generated by certain embodiments of the present invention. The vibration<br>
signal may include a plurality of frequencies (applied serially or concurrently in a<br>
superimposed manner) that are selectively applied to the dry powder formulation<br>
flowing through a hopper and/or nozzle so that it is modified to match or correspond<br>
to the flow characteristics of the dry powder formulation to reliably induce a fluid<br>
flow state to promote uniform non-aggregated flow.<br><br>
An example of a commercially available rotating drum is the TSI Amherst<br>
Aero-Flow™ (TSI Inc. Particle Instruments/Amherst, Amherst, MA). This device<br>
provides powder flow information by detecting the occurrence of and recording the<br>
time between avalanches. The Aero-Flow™ has been utilized to demonstrate<br>
correlation between powder flow and tableting performance for like materials. The<br>
instrument uses a photocell detebtor for its avalanche detection mechanism. A light<br>
shines through the Plexiglas drum and is obscured from the detector to varying<br>
degrees by powder contained in the drum. As the drum rotates, the powder heap rises<br>
with the rotation and the photocell detector is uncovered. When an avalanche occurs<br>
in the powder heap, the light is again blocked by the cascading powder. The change<br>
in light intensity striking the photocell is interpreted by the data collection software as<br>
the occurrence of an avalanche. In other embodiments, the powder can be evaluated<br>
to determine and/or measure avalanches using a sensitive microphone/accelerometer<br>
that can be mounted on the rotating drum. Avalanches can be determined acoustically<br>
from the sound generated by the avalanching powder. This evaluation technique may<br>
allow for reduced amounts of the dry powder that is desired for use during the<br>
avalanche evaluation to milligram quantities, such as about 10 mg or less. In any<br>
event, statistics of the time between avalanches can be determined and an avalanche<br>
time phase space plot can be generated.<br>
A useful method of presenting data to discover the dynamics of a system is the<br>
Poincare phase space plot. This phase space approach is one in which variables<br>
sufficient to describe a system are contained in a single vector. The state of the n<br>
variables at an instant in time is a point in phase space. Plotting the time evolution of<br>
the system in phase space can map its dynamics. As an example, a simple harmonic<br>
oscillator can be pictured in phase space by plotting the position versus the velocity,<br>
variables that completely describe the system. The phase space plot of the harmonic<br>
oscillator is a circle reflecting the periodic, but 90-degrees out of phase, exchange of<br>
maximum position and velocity. A damped harmonic oscillator would appear as a<br>
simple attractor with the trajectory encircling and eventually collapsing to the origin<br>
as the position and velocity reach zero. The correlation dimension provides a measure<br>
of the space filling properties of the phase space representation. A hypersphere of<br>
dimension D and radius r is centered on each data point. The number of data points<br>
falling within that sphere as a function of the radius may be displayed in a log-log<br>
plot. The slope of the resulting line may be termed the correlation dimension.<br>
To determine an appropriate vibration signal, a suitably sized dry powder<br>
sample can be disposed in the drum (such as about 60 ml of powder). The drum can<br>
be allowed to rotate through a single revolution before data collection begins so that<br>
initial conditions over several powders are similar. The drum can be rotated at 0.5<br>
revolutions per minute for 6 minutes. The photocell voltage signal can be sampled at<br>
25 Hz using a PC based data acquisition board (DI-170, Dataq Instruments, Akron<br>
OH). Time between avalanches and the voltage change upon avalanching can be<br>
acquired from the voltage signal. A video camera can be situated perpendicular to the<br>
drum can record the powder as it rotates in the drum. A grid can be placed behind the<br>
drum, without obscuring the photocell, to facilitate determination of the angle of the<br>
powder relative to the horizontal. Upon viewing the video, the base and height of the<br>
powder heap can be recorded and the angle can be determined using the trigonometric<br>
relation, ? = arctan(height/base). Determinations of the instantaneous powder angle<br>
can be performed at 200 millisecond intervals. This rate corresponds to every sixth<br>
frame of the video, determined previously by recording the counting of a stopwatch.<br>
Angle data time series can comprise at least about 500 data points or 100<br>
seconds. Computation of a Fourier power spectrum can be performed using the<br>
Welch method with a 128 point Kaiser window and zero padding to 1024 data points<br>
for the FFT calculation. Other suitable methods can be employed as is known to<br>
those of skill in the art.<br>
The avalanche statistics can be presented in terms of the mean and standard<br>
deviation of time between avalanches. A phase space plot can be generated by<br>
plotting the nth time to avalanche against the (n-1)th time to avalanche. For the angle<br>
of repose, phase space plots consist of the instantaneous deviation from the mean<br>
angle versus the first time derivative of the angle. The rate of change of the angle at<br>
each data point can be approximated from the preceding and subsequent data points<br>
using Newton's method.<br>
The uniformity of flow can be discerned by examining the frequency and the<br>
amplitude of the oscillations. Certain dry powder signals may exhibit a higher degree<br>
of variability in frequency and in amplitude relative to others. By use of the Fourier<br>
transform (FT) power spectrum, energy distributions can be obtained. Energy<br><br>
spectrums that are dispersed over a range of frequencies can indicate more irregular<br>
flow. The mean time to avalanche can be subtracted from the instantaneous time to<br>
avalanche to deconvolute relevant frequency data in angle phase space plots.<br>
Identifying the predominant frequencies and selectively combining and/or using those<br>
identified frequencies as the basis of the transmitted vibration energy excitation signal<br>
may induce resonance in the dry powder during dispensing.<br>
Other analysis methods and apparatus can be employed. For example, as<br>
shown in Figure 13, an example of one apparatus that is configured to allow<br>
adjustment of the excitation signal and/or angle of flow for a powder under<br>
evaluation, can be used and the adjustments altered until reliable fluidic flow is<br>
output. The operational parameters determined in that manner can be used to define<br>
the non-linear customized fluidic flow signal for dispensing that powder. The<br>
apparatus shown in Figure 13 may also be used during active dispensing using one or<br>
more of the devices (depending on the desired delivery capacity). This apparatus will<br>
be discussed further below.<br>
Referring back to Figure 1A, the vibratory energy signal 20s can be generated<br>
and applied to the dry powder 15 so that the dry powder is exposed to a force vector<br>
having a downward orientation Fv as it travels through a portion of the hopper 25 and<br>
exits the dispensing port 25p (in the same direction as Fg). During dispensing, the<br>
apparent bulk density of the dry powder can be temporarily increased over its real<br>
bulk density without (irreversibly) aggregating the dry powder thereby allowing the<br>
dry powder to flow in a more uniform fluid like manner. The non-linear vibration<br>
energy signal may be supplemented by other vibration energies as will be discussed<br>
further below.<br>
In certain embodiments, the signal 20s and/or the vibration of the energy<br>
transmitting surfaces in the channel 25 may concurrently or successively rapidly<br>
vibrate the dry powder at a plurality of different frequencies (at similar or different .<br>
amplitudes) in the range of between about 10 Hz-1000 kHz. In certain embodiments,<br>
the frequencies are between about 10-200 Hz, such as 10-60 Hz. In other<br>
embodiments, they may be in the range of between about 7kHz-100 kHz, such as<br>
7.5kHz or more such as frequencies between about 15 kHz to 50 kHz.<br>
The vibration signal 20s can be generated by any suitable vibratory source,<br>
including electrical means, mechanical means, and/or electro-mechanical means.<br><br>
That is, at least a portion of the hopper 25 can be (physically) translated by and/or in a<br>
predetermined non-linear vibration imparting motion to impart a downwardly oriented<br>
force vector Fv using powder specific signals. Examples of vibratory sources include,<br>
but are not limited to, one or more of: (a) ultrasound or other acoustic or sound based<br>
sources (above, below or at audible wavelengths) that can be used to instantaneously<br>
apply non-linear pressure signals onto the dry powder 15; (b) electrical or mechanical<br>
deflection of the sidewalls of the hopper or dispensing port 25p; (c) movement of the<br>
hopper 25 or portions thereof (such as, but not limited to, physically moving and/or<br>
deflecting portions such as solenoids, piezoelectrically active portions and the like)<br>
non-linearly about the axis 25a (comprising one or more of selectably controllable<br>
amounts of travel in the horizontal, vertical, and/or diagonal directions relative to the<br>
flow path axis 25a); and (d) oscillating or pulsed gas (airstreams), which can<br>
introduce changes in one or more of volume flow, linear velocity, and/or pressure.<br>
Examples of mechanical and/or electro-mechanical vibratory devices are described in<br>
U.S. Patent Nos. 5,727,607, 5,909,829 and 5,947,169, the contents of which are<br>
incorporated by reference as if recited in full herein.<br>
Referring again to Figure 1C, in certain embodiments, at least a portion of the<br>
length of the hopper walls 25w (either an inner, outer or intermediate surface) may be<br>
formed of a piezoelectrically active material so that application of a (non-linear)<br>
powder specific voltage signal generates (non-linear) flexure of the wall 25w which<br>
can be transmitted to the dry powder 15 during dispensing. The piezoelectric material<br>
may be ceramic or an elastomeric (such a polymer and/or copolymer based) material.<br>
If the piezoelectric material is located on an outside or inner surface, the surface may<br>
be configured to transfer the energy to the dry powder while inhibiting loss of the<br>
strength of the signal. In other embodiments, the inner surface may be configured to<br>
actually amplify the signal while in yet other embodiments, the signal takes into<br>
account the loss of the transmission through intermediate mediums and materials.<br>
Figure 5A illustrates that a major portion of the length of the walls 225w that<br>
define the interior chamber of the hopper 25 can be piezoelectrically active. In other<br>
embodiments selective portions (illustrated by the cross hatch markings in Figure 5A)<br>
can be formed to be piezoelectrically active. The selective portions may be<br>
continuous or segmented and spaced apart along the hopper 25. In certain<br>
embodiments, a series of radially and/or longitudinally spaced apart portions, other<br><br>
flow channel portions, or substantially the entire perimeter of a flow channel, can be<br>
made to be piezoelectrically active.<br>
In addition, to increase the piezoelectric active surface area, at least one<br>
interior component 225a that comprises piezoelectric material can be disposed in the<br>
flow path. The interior component 225a may have a planar, spherical, cylindrical, or<br>
any other desired configuration.' It may be fixed in the cavity of the hopper so that it<br>
is held in a static vertically position or may be dynamically mounted in the cavity.<br>
The entire perimeter of the interior component 225a may be active and able to flex, or<br>
selective portions or sides may be configured to flex. The interior component 225a<br>
may be rotatable or translatable (up, down, angularly, and the like) while also being<br>
able to flex in response to applied voltage or current. The interior component 225a<br>
and the walls 225w may be controlled by a single signal generator. Different signals,<br>
including signal line shapes, amplitudes of voltages, and the like may be applied at<br>
different locations so that the non-linear vibratory energy is cumulatively effectively<br>
transferred to the dry powder to facilitate fluid flow. In other embodiments,<br>
reciprocating voltage signal patterns or signals may be used (on opposing wall<br>
segments or between the intermediate component and a facing wall) to amplify the<br>
vibratory signal.<br>
The signal 20s can be influenced by the amount of active surface and the<br>
excitation voltage pulses applied thereto as well as the channel geometry. During<br>
dispensing, the hopper channel can be vibrated by providing a voltage across the<br>
piezoelectric layer. In certain embodiments, the voltage provided may be at about<br>
100-200 volts peak-to-peak. In other embodiments, the voltage can be applied at a<br>
different level and at other various frequencies, such as at a higher frequency of<br>
between about 25kHz to about 2MHz.<br>
In certain embodiments, the piezoelectric material, shown generally as<br>
element 225w in Figure 5A can be formed from a piezoelectrically active material<br>
such as PVDF (known as KYNAR piezo film or polyvinylidene fluoride) and its<br>
copolymers or polyvinylidene difluoride and its copolymers (such as PVDF with its<br>
copolymer trifluoroethylene (PVDF-TrFe)). The piezoelectric material can be a thin<br>
flexible layer or film. The term "thin film" typically means that the layer has a<br>
thickness that is less than about 200 microns thick, and more typically less than about<br>
100 microns thick (such as about 28 microns).<br><br>
Non-vibratory insulating material (such as neoprene) can be disposed to hold<br>
the polymer and/or copolymer which can increase the interchange between the dry<br>
powder and the piezoelectric material; this may increase the amount of energy<br>
transferred to the dry powder from the oscillating or vibrating active pie2oelectric<br>
polymer film so as to cause the dry powder to vibrate at a frequency that is at or near<br>
a resonant frequency thereof. In certain embodiments, laminates of one or more<br>
layers of PVDF and other material layers can be used. Suitable laminates include, but<br>
are not limited to, thin film layers of PVDF united to thin layers of one or more of<br>
aluminum, PVC and nylon films. The aluminum may help the channel hold its<br>
desired shape. The PVDF may form the bottom, top or intermediate layer of the<br>
laminate, structure. For intermediate layer configurations, vias and/or edge<br>
connections can be used to apply the electric excitation signal.<br>
In other embodiments, the piezoelectrically active material can be a ceramic.<br>
Examples of piezo-ceramic materials and elements are available from EDO<br>
Corporation, Salt Lake City, Utah. Generally described, piezoceramic materials can<br>
produce motion by receiving electric potential across their polarized surfaces. See<br>
Mostafa Hedayatnia, Smart Materials for Silent Alarms, Mechanical Engineering, at<br>
www. Memagazine.org/contents/current/fearures/alarms.html (© 1998 ASME). Other<br>
piezo-electric materials can also be employed as long as they have sufficient structural<br>
rigidity or strength (alone or applied to another substrate) to provide the desired<br>
vibratory motion for the dry powder.<br>
In certain embodiments, the hopper 25 can be shaped and/or sized to define a<br>
resonant chamber or cavity to generate a desired frequency of oscillation of the<br>
piezoelectric material and/or a particular dry powder formulation. That is, each blend<br>
or formulation of dry powder may exhibit different flow characteristics that can be<br>
accounted for in the geometry design of the hopper 25 and/or the applied signal. The<br>
height, depth, length, or width of the hopper flow path channel may be adjusted based<br>
on the particular drug or dry powder being administered.<br>
Metal trace patterns, where used, can be provided by applying a conductive<br>
pattern onto one or more of the outer faces of the piezoelectric substrate layer. For<br>
depositing or forming the metal, any metal depositing or layering technique can be<br>
employed such as electron beam evaporation, thermal evaporation, painting, spraying,<br>
dipping, or sputtering a conductive material or metallic paint and the like or material<br><br>
over the selected surfaces of the piezoelectric substrate (preferably a PVDF layer as<br>
noted above). Of course, alternative metallic circuits, foils, surfaces, or techniques<br>
can also be employed, such as attaching a conductive mylar layer or flex circuit over<br>
the desired portion of the outer surface of the piezoelectric substrate layer.<br>
Generally described, for piezoelectric polymer materials, inner and outer<br>
surface metal trace patterns can be formed on opposing sides of the piezoelectric<br>
polymer material in a manner that provides separation (the opposing traces do not<br>
connect or contact each other). For example, conductive paint or ink (such as silver<br>
or gold) can be applied onto the major surfaces of the package about the elongated<br>
channels and associated metal traces such that it does not extend over the perimeter<br>
edge portions of the piezoelectric substrate layer, thereby keeping the metal trace<br>
patterns on the top and bottom surfaces separated with the piezoelectric substrate<br>
layer therebetween. This configuration forms the electrical excitation path when<br>
connected to a control system to provide the input/excitation signal for creating the<br>
electrical field that activates the deformation of the piezoelectric substrate layer<br>
during operation. The excitation circuit configuration can be suchthat the upper<br>
trace operates with a positive polarity while the lower trace has a negative polarity or<br>
ground, or vice versa (thereby providing the electric field/voltage differential to excite<br>
the piezoelectric substrate). Of course, the polarities can also be rapidly reversed<br>
during application of the excitation signal (such as + to -, or + to -) depending on the<br>
type of excitation signal used, thereby flexing the piezoelectric material in the region<br>
of the receptacle portion. For a more complete discussion of the active excitation path<br>
or configuration as used in forming blister packages, see U.S. Provisional Application<br>
Serial No. 60/188,543 to Hickey et al., and corresponding International PCT<br>
publication WO 01/68169, the contents of which are incorporated by reference herein.<br>
In addition, the piezoelectric polymer material may be configured as two sandwiched<br>
piezoelectric polymer film layers separated by an intermediately positioned pliable<br>
core, all of which are concurrently defonnable by the application of voltage<br>
thereacross.<br>
Figure 5B illustrates an alternate embodiment of the present invention. In this<br>
embodiment, the bulk density of the dry powder is (temporarily) increased along the<br>
flow path during the flowing dispensing operation. As shown, the hopper 25 includes<br>
a permeable member 325 that forms a portion of the wall segment in the flow path.<br><br>
The bulk density 15pl of the dry powder 15 above this segment is reduced (shown by<br>
fewer numbers of spaced apart particles) to the bulk density below or at this segment<br>
15p2 (shown by a condensed or increased concentration of particles). The permeable<br>
member 325 is configured to receive pressurized gas at a first wall inlet region 325i<br>
and expel it at an egress portion 325e across from the receiving region 325i so that the<br>
forced gas travels across the dry powder and flow path as the dry powder is dispensed<br>
vertically at the port 25p. The pressure of the forced gas flow is higher at the inlet<br>
region than at the egress or outlet region 325e. This cross-travel provides a pressure<br>
drop that slightly compresses the dry powder to increase the apparent bulk density<br>
(making it heavier with a larger downwardly oriented Fv) to facilitate meted<br>
dispensing. In certain embodiments, the permeable member 325 is configured to<br>
direct an exogenous pressurized gas (such as air) to flow at substantially 90 degrees<br>
across the flow path while the dry powder is flowing downwardly in a manner that<br>
inhibits aggregation. This can temporally compress the dry powder to increase the<br>
bulk density of the dry powder.<br>
The permeable member 325 can define a portion of the wall 325w of the flow<br>
path to provide a substantially continuous contour inner wall. The inlet region 325i<br>
and outlet region 325e may be horizontally symmetrically disposed about the axis of<br>
the flow path 25a (as shown) or may be vertically offset (not shown), such as with the<br>
egress portion below the inlet portion. In any event, the permeable member 325 is<br>
configured to generate a predominantly cross-flow forced air pattern. The desired<br>
entry pressure and pressure drop can be selected as a function of particle size, size<br>
distribution, porosity, and apparent density. In certain embodiments, the pressure can<br>
be provided at between about 1.10-5 atm and the pressure drop across the flow path<br>
(measured at the exit or egress region) can be less than 10-20%. In certain<br>
embodiments, the bulk density may be increased by about 10-100%.<br>
In certain embodiments, the permeable member 325 can be a filter or stainless<br>
steel frit that is sized and configured to allow gas or air flow thereacross with a pore<br>
size that inhibits dry powder from exiting from same when exposed to the pressurized<br>
gas cross-flow. Other suitably configured materials and structures may also be used.<br>
Preferably, the permeable member 325 and the components defining the dry powder<br>
contact surfaces in the flow path of the dispensing system 10 are configured to<br>
dispense in vivo biocompatible, formulations and to withstand periodic sterilization<br><br>
cleaning procedures. In other embodiments, portions of the flow path may be<br>
disposable after dispensing a suitable number of doses to promote anti-aggregation<br>
improved flow and/or reduced-maintenance systems.<br>
In certain embodiments, multiple vibratory inputs can be employed<br>
concurrently, alone or in combination with the non-linear sources. Thus, for example,<br>
the hopper and dispensing port have an associated axis extending along the gas flow<br>
path and the system can include a translation mechanism that moves at least a portion<br>
of the hopper in a desired motion, such as an eccentric motion, so that at least a<br>
portion of the hopper oscillates relative to the axis and, in operation, generates a force<br>
with a downward force component or vector that is transmitted to the dry powder<br>
during dispensing. In other examples, a portion of the hopper 25 (and/or each<br>
individual dispensing head 425h, see Figure 9) may be exposed to centrifugal<br>
acceleration or other suitable motion to impart an angular velocity onto the dry<br>
powder held therein, thereby introducing downward force vectors, Fv, onto the dry<br>
powder during flow to compress the powder bed to increase the apparent bulk density<br>
and inhibit aggregation without requiring evacuation of the flowing (low density)<br>
powder.<br>
Figure 6 illustrates that the dispensing system 10 can be configured to operate<br>
with both non-linear vibration energy and centrifugal motion 20m (represented by the<br>
arrows dispersed about the axis 25a). The motion may be accomplished by moving,<br>
or oscillating, the hopper 25 about its axis 25a. In operation, the motion 20m can<br>
generate a force with a downward force component or vector that is transmitted to the<br>
dry powder during dispensing.<br>
Figure 7 illustrates one embodiment whereby local non-linear vibration<br>
energy can be applied to the dry powder 15. As shown, the hopper 25 includes a head<br>
portion 25h with an insert 31 held therein. The insert 31 can be configured as an<br>
elongated insert that is held in the flow path in the hopper 15 such that the insert 31 is<br>
pivotally and/or floatably held in the flow path and extends a distance out of the<br>
dispensing port 25p and rotates relative to the hopper 25 and the axis 25a during<br>
dispensing to transmit directional acceleration to particles of the dry powder 15. The<br>
dry powder 15 may be dispensed through the end portion of the insert 31. Figure 8<br>
illustrates that the insert 31' can be configured to define a flow path 25f and a<br>
dispensing port that is translated in a predetermined motion 20s about the axis 20a,<br><br>
during operation. In other embodiments, the insert 31,31' may comprise outwardly<br>
extendable members that move up and down corresponding to their speed of<br>
translation (not shown).<br>
In any event, the insert 31, 31' can be translated and/or oscillated with a<br>
selected motion that has an associated non-constant period or periods, or may have a<br>
cyclical constant period or periods. The insert 31, 31' may be oscillated relative to<br>
the axis 25a to generate a force with a downward component or vector Fv that is<br>
transmitted to the dry powder 15 during dispensing. The insert 31,31' may also<br>
comprise portions formed of piezoelectrically active material that can be excited to<br>
generate vibration energy.<br>
Figure 9 illustrates yet another embodiment of a dispensing system 10. As<br>
shown, the system 10 includes a hopper 25 that is sized and configured as a central<br>
hopper 425 that feeds a plurality of dispensing heads 425h. Vibration energy can be<br>
applied to a rack of heads, filling from a single hopper 425h. The central hopper can<br>
be translated back and forth in non-linear or linear manner to vibrate the contents<br>
thereof (the motion shown by arrows and element number 425m). The individual<br>
heads 425h can also be translated (rotated about the axis or moved up, down,<br>
diagonally, or otherwise) in a desired linear or non-linear manner. In particular<br>
embodiments, the heads 425h may be translated to generate an angular velocity that is<br>
sufficient to give directional acceleration to the particles. The extremes of motion or<br>
travel of the hopper 425 and/or the heads 425h may be very small, particularly when<br>
carried out at high frequencies. Thus, it is contemplated that the vibration generation<br>
energy output can employ a high frequency motion applied onto a selected portion of<br>
the hopper 425, with the outer bounds of the physical motion of the hopper being<br>
small. The term "high frequency" means frequencies in the range of between about 1<br>
kHz-1000 kHz, typically at between about 10-100 kHz with the small bounds of travel<br>
including movement in the range of between about 50-500 mm, and typically about<br>
10-100 mm, or even less.<br>
Figure 10A illustrates a dispensing system 10 that cooperates with a sheet of<br>
receiving substrate material 500 that employs elastomeric piezoelectrically active<br>
material that can be used to measure small meted quantities of dry powders 15. As<br>
described for the piezoelectric material for the hopper 25 above, the piezoelectrically<br>
active substrate 500 can include a PVDF material. The PVDF material' can be treated<br><br>
to have a metallic pattern 500e that can detect changes in a desired electrical<br>
parameter. One unitary sheet can be used with electrically isolated individual dose<br>
regions 500d or separate sheets can be used for each dose (not shown). The sheet 500<br>
can be held in tension (along the length and/or width of the sheet) while a quantity of<br>
dry powder 15 is dispensed thereon. The tensioning may be provided by wrapping<br>
opposing end portions about tensioning bars that can be adjustably rolled to provide<br>
the desired tension. In other embodiments, the tensioning can be provided by tenting<br>
end portions of the sheet 500 over spaced apart structural members that may include a<br>
center support member (not shown). The sheets may have self-tensioning members<br>
that are portable therewith or tensioning members that are affixed to a conveying<br>
surface. Other tensioning mechanisms can also be employed as will be appreciated by<br>
one of skill in the art. Standard weighing techniques well known to those of skill in<br>
the art may also be used to determine the weight of the dispensed dose(s).<br>
An alteration in a selected monitored electrical parameter that is induced by<br>
the weight residing on a dose region can be detected and a meted mass calculated by<br>
the amount of shift. The shift may be measured in a relative (pre and post change) or<br>
absolute amount (defining a pre-amount by a calibration number).<br>
A detection system 510 can be configured to serially engage the dose regions<br>
on the sheet 500 or to simultaneously engage all of the dose regions and selectively<br>
activate the detection to measure the desired location. The detection system 510 can<br>
be in communication with the dispensing system control system to provide dynamic<br>
real-time feedback data regarding the meted quantity that can be used to control the<br>
operation of the dispensing system. The data may be used to control the open time of<br>
gated flow paths that can be controlled to mete the desired amount. Over or under<br>
amounts, or departures from predetermined variability levels, may be indicated when<br>
detected.<br>
The detection system 510 may be configured to detect a change in capacitance<br>
or to obtain a plurality of voltage values (which may be transient) over time, during<br>
dispensing. Alternatively, the detection system 510 may be configured to detect after<br>
the dispensing. The induced change in the selected parameter or parameters is<br>
generated by the flexure or strain associated with the downwardly generated force<br>
associated with the weight of the dry powder on the stretched (tensioned)<br>
piezoelectrically active foil region 500d. Thus, the capacitance change and the like<br><br>
correspond to the deposited weight. The signal may be used to weigh or measure<br>
masses in the range of under about 30mg, and preferably under about 15mg, and still<br>
more preferably in the range of between about 10µm-10mg. Other electrical<br>
parameters may also be used such as, but not limited to, resonant frequency, and the<br>
like. Using the resonant frequency and/or capacitance parameter may provide<br>
increased sensitivity or resolution.<br>
Figure 11 is a block diagram of exemplary embodiments of data processing<br>
systems that illustrates systems, methods, and computer program products in<br>
accordance with embodiments of the present invention. The processor 410<br>
communicates with the memory 414 via an address/data bus 448. The processor 410<br>
can be any commercially available or custom microprocessor. The memory 314 is<br>
representative of the overall hierarchy of memory devices containing the software and<br>
data used to implement the functionality of the data processing system 405. The<br>
memory 414 can include, but is not limited to, the following types of devices: cache,<br>
ROM, PROM, EPROM, EEPROM, flash memory, SRAM, and DRAM.<br>
As shown in Figure 11, the memory 414 may include several categories of<br>
software and data used in the data processing system 405: the operating system 452;<br>
the application programs 454; the input/output (I/O) device drivers 458; the powder<br>
specific (vibratory) signal generator module 450; and the data 456. The data 456 may<br>
include a plurality of dry powder data 451 corresponding to particular or target signal<br>
parameters for each dry powder, which may be obtained from an operator or stored by<br>
the dispensing system 420 and/or timing data that defines the meted dose amounts,<br>
flow rates, and open time for the dispensing port (allowing automatic control of the<br>
dispensing operation, dependent on the dry powder being dispensed). As will be<br>
appreciated by those of skill in the art, the operating system 452 may be any operating<br>
system suitable for use with a data processing system, such as OS/2, ADC, OS/390 or<br>
System390 from International Business Machines Corporation, Armonk, NY,<br>
Windows CE, Windows NT, Windows95, Windaws98 or Windows2000 from<br>
Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, Unix or Linux or FreeBSD, Palm OS from<br>
Palm, Inc., Mac OS from Apple Computer, LabView, or proprietary operating<br>
systems. The I/O device drivers 458 typically include software routines accessed<br>
through the operating system 452 by the application programs 454 to communicate<br>
with devices such as I/O data port(s), data storage 456 and certain memory 414<br>
components and/or the dispensing system 420.<br>
The application programs 454 are illustrative of the programs that implement<br>
the various features of the data processing system 405 and preferably include at least<br>
one application which supports operations according to embodiments of the present<br>
invention. Finally, the data 456 represents the static and dynamic data used by the<br>
application programs 454, the operating system 452, the I/O device drivers 458, and<br>
other software programs that may reside in the memory 414.<br>
While the present invention is illustrated, for example, with reference to the<br>
powder-specific signal generator module 450 being an application program in Figure<br>
11, as will be appreciated by those of skill in the art, other configurations may also be<br>
utilized while still benefiting from the teachings of the present invention. For<br>
example, the module 450 may also be incorporated into the operating system 452, the<br>
I/O device drivers 458 or other such logical division of the data processing system<br>
405. Thus, the present invention should not be construed as limited to the<br>
configuration of Figure 11, which is intended to encompass any configuration<br>
capable of carrying out the operations described herein.<br>
In certain embodiments, the powder-specific signal generator module 450<br>
includes computer program code for automatically determining the type of vibratory<br>
input desired to generate a non-linear vibratory energy signal directing the selective<br>
operation of the vibratory energy in and/or along the flow path according to the dry<br>
powder being dispensed.<br>
The I/O data port can be used to transfer information between the data<br>
processing system 405 and the dispensing system 420 or another computer system or<br>
a network (e.g., an intranet and/or the Internet) or to other devices controlled by the<br>
processor. These components may be conventional components such as those used in<br>
many conventional data processing systems which may be configured in accordance<br>
with the present invention to operate as described herein.<br>
While the present invention is illustrated, for example, with reference to<br>
particular divisions of programs, functions and memories, the present invention<br>
should not be construed as limited to such logical divisions. Thus, the present<br>
invention should not be construed as limited to the configuration of Figure 11 but is<br>
intended to encompass any configuration capable of carrying out the operations<br>
described herein.<br>
The flowcharts and block diagrams of certain of the figures herein illustrate<br>
the architecture, functionality, and operation of possible implementations of dry<br>
powder-specific dispensing and/or vibratory energy excitation means according to the<br>
present invention. In this regard, each block in the flow charts or block diagrams<br>
represents a module, segment, or portion of code, which comprises one or more<br>
executable instructions for implementing the specified logical function(s). It should<br>
also be noted that in some alternative implementations, the functions noted in the<br>
blocks may occur out of the order noted in the figures. For example, two blocks<br>
shown in succession may in fact be executed substantially concurrently or the blocks<br>
may sometimes be executed in the reverse order, depending upon the functionality<br>
involved.<br>
In certain embodiments, the system 10 can accept user input regarding the<br>
type of dry powder being dispensed. The system 10 can be configured to accept<br>
manual or electronic input and production batches (with the desired drug to be<br>
dispensed) can be identified over a selected period of time and saved for automatic<br>
interrogation by the control module upon each new batch, shift, or other desired time<br>
interval.<br>
In certain embodiments, the present invention can provide computer program<br>
products for operating a flowing dry powder dispensing system having an associated<br>
dry powder flow path with a dispensing port and a vibration energy source associated<br>
therewith to facilitate fluidic flow. The computer program product can include a<br>
computer readable storage medium having computer readable program code<br>
embodied in the medium. The computer-readable program code can include: (a)<br>
computer readable program code that identifies at lease one, and typically, a plurality<br>
of different, powder-specific vibration energy signals, (where a plurality of signals is<br>
used, there is a respective one for each of the plurality of different dry powders), each<br>
of the vibration energy signals corresponding to individually predetermined flow<br>
property data of the plurality of dry powders; and (b) computer readable program<br>
code that directs the dispensing system to operate using the powder-specific vibration<br>
energy signal associated with a target dry powder (which can be selected from a<br>
library of pre-identified selectable versions of the plurality of different vibration<br>
energy signals).<br>
In certain embodiments, the powder specific vibration energy signals are non-<br>
linear. The computer program code can accept user input to identify the dry powder<br>
being dispensed, and computer program code that automatically selectively adjusts<br>
the output of the vibration energy signal based on the identified dry powder being<br>
dispensed. The vibration energy output signals for the dry powders being dispensed<br>
are based on data obtained from a fractal mass flow analysis or other suitable analysis<br>
of the different dry powders. The dispensing system and computer controller may be<br>
particularly suited to dispense low-density dry powder.<br>
The output signals may be include at least two, and typically a plurality of at<br>
least three, superpositioned modulating frequencies and a selected carrier frequency.<br>
The modulating frequencies can be in the range noted herein (typically between abou<br>
10-500 Hz), and, in certain embodiments may include at least three, and typically<br>
about four superpositioned modulating frequencies in the range of between about 10-<br>
100Hz, and more typically, four superpositioned modulating frequencies in the range<br>
of between about 10-15Hz.<br>
The computer program code can controllably dispenses meted quantities of<br>
dry powder independent of volumetric evaluations by considering flow rate of the dry<br>
powder out of the dispensing port and controlling the amount of time the dispensing<br>
port is open during dispensing.<br>
Figure 12 illustrates operations that can be carried out to evaluate or selected<br>
desired dispensing signals and/or system configuration parameters that can then be<br>
used to dispense target dry powders according to embodiments of the present<br>
invention. These operations can be used to determine the powder specific (vibratory)<br>
signal(s) of different target dry powders, the powder specific signal can then be<br>
implemented in a vibratory signal generator computer module for operating signal<br>
generators for dispensing a dry powder of interest<br>
As shown in Figure 12, a flow channel housing having an angularly<br>
adjustable elongate flow channel therein is provided (block 600). The orientation of<br>
the flow channel is adjusted so that the flow channel is angularly offset (with the<br>
dispensing port located lower than the input port) in the axial direction with respect to<br>
the horizontal and vertical axis (block 610). In certain embodiments, the flow<br><br>
channel is adjusted to be at different selected angles during the evaluation to consider<br>
the impact that the angle may have on the dispensing flow.<br>
A dry powder of interest is introduced into the elongate flow channel (block<br>
614). The dry powder can be a low-density dry powder (block 616). The flow<br>
channel can be vibrated to thereby vibrate the dry powder to cause the dry powder to<br>
fluidly flow out of the channel via an exit port (block 615). The flow channel can<br>
include a flexible piezoelectric polymer over which the dry powder flows; the<br>
piezoelectric polymer can be electrically stimulated to flex upwardly to cause it to<br>
vibrate the powder as the powder travels along and through the flow channel. As<br>
described above, the vibration can carried out using a non-linear excitation signal<br>
having a carrier frequency and a modulation frequency (block 617). In certain<br>
embodiments, the carrier frequency can be between about 2.5kHz-50kHz and<br>
modulation frequency may be between about 10-500Hz. In any event, flow<br>
characteristics can be evaluated, typically over several different input signals at<br>
different frequencies, and at least one frequency (and/or angular orientation of the<br>
flow path) selected for its ability to generate reproducible fluidic flow of dry powder<br>
based on the flow characteristics exhibited during the vibrating step (block 620).<br>
To generate sufficient flow in the flow channel to allow evaluation and/or<br>
reliable dispensing, a dry powder mass input of between about 2-50 mg or greater<br>
may be used to provide fluid flow through the dispensing port.<br>
The apparatus can be configured to generate a reproducible flow rate (less than<br>
about +/-10% variation) for dispensing reliable amounts of dry powders. The<br>
average flow rate generated for certain low-density dry powders may be in the range<br>
of between about 0.001-5 mg/sec. In certain embodiments, the flow rate may be<br>
about 0.028 mg/sec. In other embodiments, typically for unit density and/or medium<br>
density powders, the flow rates may be greater, such as greater than 5 mg/sec and up<br>
to about 50 mg/sec, typically between about 10-30 mg/sec.<br>
Several parameters can influence the dispensing flow rate, such as, but not<br>
limited to, the amount (mass) of dry powder input into the flow channel, the angle of<br>
the flow channel, the size of certain components, such as the surface area of the<br>
piezoelectric material that contacts the dry powder, the channel and/or orifice<br>
volumetric size (particularly the depth and width of the channel), the dry powder<br>
itseif, as well as the vibratory signal input to excite the powder to move it through the<br>
flow channel can influence.<br>
Figure 13 illustrates a dry powder dispensing apparatus 700 that can be used<br>
to dispense dry powders. The apparatus 700 can be used at a laboratory and/or<br>
research site using flow parameters or signals that can generate fluidic flow for a dry<br>
powder of interest. In other embodiments, the apparatus 700 can be used in a<br>
scientific, research or small-scale academic and/or commercial program. For<br>
example, the device 700 can be used in a drug discovery program or clinical trial<br>
application where it is desired to provide or dispense reliable dose amounts without<br>
need for mass production ranap-up for scaled commercialization. Thus, the apparatus<br>
700 may be used to provide discrete doses in desired reliable amounts (typically in the<br>
50µg-10mg range), but larger or smaller doses can also be provided, typically for drug<br>
evaluation, without requiring relatively expensive equipment costs and/or in a manner<br>
that is not labor intensive. In other embodiments, the apparatus 700 can be used to<br>
develop signals that are matched to a particular dry powder. The signal(s) can then be<br>
implemented using the same oi a different dispensing apparatus, such as those<br>
described above, at any desired dispensing location.<br>
Referring back to Figure 13, the apparatus 700 includes a channel member<br>
710, a cover member 720, and an intermediately positioned flexible piezoelectric<br>
polymer layer 730. The channel member 710 holds an elongate powder flow channel<br>
710f that has a depth, width, and length. The piezoelectric polymer layer 730 can be<br>
positioned to overlie the channel 710f and the sidewalls to hold the dry powder as it<br>
moves through the flow channel 710f. Suitable materials for forming the flexible<br>
piezoelectric polymer layer 730 can be obtained from Measurement Specialties, Inc..<br>
located in Fairfield, NJ. One example of a suitable material is a 28 micron<br>
piezoelectric film sheet, silver ink metallized PVDF, identified as Part No. 1-100-<br>
4346-0. The piezoelectric polymer layer can include additional material layers<br>
attached thereto and/or coatings disposed thereon.<br>
Figures 14A-14C illustrate one embodiment of a channel member 710. As<br>
shown in Figure 14A, the flow channel 710f has two opposing sides 710wi, 710w2<br>
and may be configured with declining sides (each side converging toward the bottom<br>
of the channel from top to bottom). In particular embodiments, the flow channel 710f<br>
may have a sectional profile that is substantially a "V" shape, with the walls 710w1,<br><br>
710w2 angling to meeting at a common center located at a lowermost portion of the<br>
channel 710b. The depth of the channel can be less than about 5 cm, typically about<br>
3.6 cm, or even less. Other configurations of the flow channel can be used, such as,<br>
but not limited to, concave, semi-circular, partial oval or partial elliptoid,<br>
frustoconical, and the like. Other channel depths may also be employed, depending<br>
on the scale, size of components, dry powder being dispensed and/or analyzed, and<br>
input used to carry out the vibration. The cover member 720 may be adjusted<br>
accordingly.<br>
The channel member 710 may be configured with an open top portion 7l0t<br>
and opposing side edge portions 710si, 710s2. Figure 14C illustrates that the flow<br>
channel has a depth D that varies along the length of the flow channel 710f. As<br>
shown, the deepest portion of the flow channel D1 is positioned proximate the dry<br>
powder intake (inlet port), while the more shallow depth D2 is positioned proximate<br>
the dispensing port 725p (Figure 13). The depth of the flow channel 710f can vary in<br>
a gradual manner, such as linearly (in a straight line) with a predefined slope.<br>
In particular embodiments, the channel 710f can have a depth D1 that is about<br>
17 mm at the inlet portion 710i of the member 710 and terminates at a depth D2 that is<br>
about the same at the exit portion 710e. The channel 710f may have a length that is<br>
less than about 20 cm. In certain embodiments, the channel has a length of about 13.1<br>
cm. The width may be less than about 5 cm, and typically about 2 cm.<br>
Figures 15A-15C illustrate one embodiment of a cover member 720. As<br>
shown in Figure 15D, the cover member 720 is sized and configured with a tip<br>
portion 720t that, when assembled to the flow channel member 710, enters a distance<br>
"L" into the flow channel 710f of the channel member 710. As such, the tip portion<br>
720t is sized and shaped to be able to be received into the flow channel 71 Of. As<br>
shown, the tip portion 720r includes sidewalls 720si, 7l0s2 that decline at the same<br>
angle as that of the walls 710w1, 710w2 of the channel member 710. Because the<br>
cover member 720 has a flange 720f of substantially constant thickness that sits on the<br>
upper portion of the flow channel member 710, the length of the tip portion 720t<br>
defines its penetration depth into the flow channel 710f. The tip portion 720t can be<br>
sized so that, in position, its lowermost portion does not contact the bottom 710b of<br>
the flow channel 710f so as to provide an open flow orifice and inhibit pinching the<br>
piezoelectric layer 730 between the two members 710, 720.<br><br>
As shown in Figure 15D, the cover member 720 includes a bottom portion<br>
720b that is configured to reside on the upper side edge portions 710s1, 710s2 of the<br>
channel member 710 to position the tip portion 720t of the cover member the desired<br>
distance into the depth of the flow channel 710f. The space extending between the tip<br>
portion 720t of the cover member 720 and the piezoelectric layer 730 extending over<br>
the bottom 710b of the flow channel 710f can be defined as the flow orifice 750.<br>
Thus, when assembled, the open flow orifice 750 proximate the dispensing outlet or<br>
port (or dispensing end of the device) can vary a desired amount. In certain<br>
embodiments, the variation is from about 2 mm-7 mm, and in other embodiments<br>
about 2-5 mm.<br>
Figure 15D illustrates the cover member 720 positioned over the flow channel<br>
member 710 with the piezoelectric layer 730 held therebetween. The assembled<br>
members 710, 720 define a gap distance (or flow orifice) between the lowermost<br>
portion of the tip portion 720r of the cover member 720 and the lowermost portion of<br>
the flow channel 710b. This gap distance can be adjusted by sliding the cover<br>
member 720 forward or rearward in the flow channel member 710.<br>
As shown in Figure 15C, the vertical or inward projection length of the tip<br>
portion 720t can vary over the axial length of the cover member 720. This allows for<br>
the device to adjust the size of the reservoir defined by the coupling of the cover<br>
member 720 to the flow channel member 710.<br>
As shown in Figures 15D and 17B, the piezoelectric material layer 730 can be<br>
tensioned across opposing sides of the flow channel 710b so that its center portion is<br>
free to flex in response to the applied excitation (vibratory) signal. The outer edge or<br>
perimeter portions of the piezoelectric material 730 can be pinched or clasped .<br>
between the overlying members 710, 720.<br>
In operation, the piezoelectric layer 730 flexes upwardly in response to the<br>
input excitation signal(s) to vibrate the powder positioned above the piezoelectric<br>
layer 730. When non-conductive cover members are employed (such as those formed<br>
of DELRIN polymer), aluminum foil can be positioned over the tip portion 720t 6f<br>
the cover member 720 to inhibit static build up in the dry powder. In other<br>
embodiments, the cover member 720 may be formed of a pharmaceutically<br>
compatible conductive material, such as stainless steel, and/or the appropriate surfaces<br>
can be coated with a desired metallic coating, such as gold. In certain embodiments,<br><br>
an ionizer bar can be placed at one or more positions in the flow channel to decrease<br>
the static charge, suitable ionizer bars are available from NRD, LLC, located in Grand<br>
Island, NY.<br>
Figure 15B illustrates that the cover member 720 can have an elongate dry<br>
powder input region 721 that is open to the channel member 710 below. Thus, in<br>
operation, the dry powder can be input at desired locations over the channel 710f even<br>
if the cover member 720 is slid (rearward or forward) a distance over the flow channel<br>
710f for adjustment of the flow orifice size. The length of the input region 721 (slot<br>
721s) may be at least about 2.9 cm. As shown in Figures 17A and 17B, the flow<br>
channel 710f can be divided into a reservoir length L1 and an adjacent flow channel<br>
length Lf. The reservoir length is that portion of the flow channel in the inlet region<br>
721 that is defined between two inserts 792, 793. The inserts 792, 793 are sized to<br>
extend through the cover member slot 721s a depth into the channel. As shown in<br>
Figure 17B, the first or upstream insert 792 has a greater length than the downstream<br>
insert 793 and is configured to extend to contact or force the piezo-layer 730 to move<br>
closer to the bottom of the channel 710f and inhibit backfiow of the powder in the<br>
reservoir so as to hold a dry powder material supply in the inlet region 721 and<br>
gradually feed the dry powder into the flow channel length Lf. The flow channel<br>
length Lr can be described as that portion of the flow channel 710f that is located<br>
downstream of the reservoir (downstream of a major portion of the input region 721,<br>
shown as downstream of the first bracket 746).<br>
Figure 16A illustrates one embodiment of a configuration of a piezoelectric<br>
layer 730 that may be a piezoelectric polymer layer. It is noted that the term<br>
"piezoelectric polymer layer" is used for ease of description, but the term "polymer"<br>
as used herein, can also include co-polymers and blends, mixtures and derivatives<br>
thereof. As shown, one long side 7301 of the layer 730 has a flap portion 730f with<br>
cut outs 730n1, 730n2 which are configured to allow upwardly extending attachment<br>
members 742, 743 (Figure 13) to extend therethrough. The other side 73012 can be<br>
substantially straight and configured to be substantially flush between the aligned<br>
portions of the cover member 720 and flow channel member 710. The attachment<br>
members 742, 743 can be used to attach upper and lower bracket pairs 746,747,<br>
which clamp the cover member 720 and flow channel member 710 together. The<br>
cover member 720 can be formed with sufficient weight to obviate the need for<br><br>
clamping, or other attachment means can be used to provide the desired holding force<br>
to keep the layer 730 in position. The flexible piezoelectric layer 730 can be<br>
preformed or formed in situ to substantially conform to the shape of the underlying<br>
channel 710f . The position of the cover member 720 and the length of the associated<br>
tip projection 720t can influence the size of the flow orifice provided by the<br>
cooperation of the layer 730 and the cover and flow channel members 720, 710,<br>
respectively.<br>
As shown in Figure 13, the layer 730 is pinched or securely held about its<br>
perimeter portion. However, the layer 730 is held in the channel 710f so that its<br>
primary surfaces are able to flex upwardly. The piezoelectric layer 730 is held so that<br>
the portion of the layer 730 in the flow channel 710f is forced to vibrate in the upward<br>
direction. As shown in Figure 13, the signal(s) can be applied directly to the<br>
piezoelectric layer 730 from a signal generator 20 via a signal lead 775.<br>
Referring again to Figure 13, an amplifier 20A can be operatively associated<br>
with the signal generator 20 and used to modulate the signal before transmitting to the<br>
layer 730, as desired. The signal generator 20 can be any suitable signal generator. In<br>
certain embodiments, the signal generator 20 is a wave signal generator that can<br>
incorporate or be operatively associated with an amplifier. The signal generator 20<br>
may be combined into a signal processor or provided by other configurations of<br>
electronic circuitry. In certain embodiments, the ground connection can be via the top<br>
surface of the polymer layer 730 with the positive contact via the bottom surface. The<br>
metallization can be removed from the region to which the ground connects.<br>
Positioning the ground connection on the top surface (where the dry powder resides)<br>
can act to inhibit the dry powder being exposed to voltage during operation. The<br>
electrical contacts can be made via a central portion of the flap 730f, although other<br>
locations may also be used.<br>
Valves or other "on-off" configurations can be used to dispense discrete<br>
amounts of the dry powder. In certain embodiments, the flow dispensing can be<br>
controlled by terminating and/or electrically decoupling the input signal from to the<br>
piezoelectric layer 730 such as by using a timer 20t (which feature is shown for<br>
example in Figure 13) that can be in communication with the layer 730 and/or valve<br>
member (not shown). As described above for other embodiments, the receiving<br>
containers may be translated under the dispensing orifice at a timed rate to provide the<br><br>
desired dose amounts. In certain embodiments, a plurality of elongate flow channels<br>
can be arranged to concurrently and/or serially dispense (the same or different) dry<br>
powder (not shown).<br>
As shown in Figure 13, the apparatus 700 may include an angle adjustment<br>
mechanism 780. As shown, the angle adjustment mechanism includes a bracket 780b<br>
upon which a portion of the underside of the flow channel member 710 can rest. The<br>
apparatus 700 can include a hinge bracket member 745 that is pivotably attached to a<br>
portion of the flow channel member 710 (and/or cover member 720). In operation,<br>
the bracket 780b can be raised and lowered and the flow channel member 710 pivots<br>
accordingly to adjust the angle of inclination of the flow channel 710f. As will be<br>
appreciated by one of skill in the art, other angle adjustment configurations can be<br>
employed. The angle adjustment mechanism 780 can include a protractor or other<br>
angular scale to allow a user to be able to ascertain the angle without undue<br>
measurement. Typically, during evaluation of a powder, when the apparatus 700 is<br>
used to ascertain flow parameters, the flow channel 710f will be positioned at several<br>
different angles. In certain embodiments, the angles evaluated can be proximate to<br>
but under the static angle of repose (under or over 90 degrees), and may, in certain<br>
embodiments, be between about 10-75 degrees.<br>
The frequency of the signal generated to cause the selected vibration to obtain<br>
the desired fluidic flow is typically influenced by the voltage amount per frequency<br>
per given capacitance. As the polymer layer defines the capacitance, the size of the<br>
layer or sheet will influence this parameter. In addition, the amplifier selected may<br>
also limit the operational frequency of the wave signal generator employed. Off the<br>
shelf units (such as a 200V amplifier) may limit the amplitude modulated (carrier)<br>
frequency output to between about 2500-7800Hz, while customized signal processors<br>
may not be so limited (capable of generating increased carrier frequencies in the range<br>
of between about 15kHz-50kHz, or more as described above). An example of a<br>
suitable waveform generator is Part No. 33120A from Agilent, located in Palo Alto,<br>
CA, and an example of an amplifier is Part No. EPA-104 from Piezo Systems, located<br>
in Cambridge, MA.<br>
The apparatus 700 can include a stationary mounting frame 790 that holds the<br>
angle adjustment mechanism 780, the hinge bracket member 745, and the flow<br>
channel and cover members 710, 720, respectively.<br><br>
As shown in Figure 13, the apparatus 700 may include a hopper 25 with a<br>
hopper outlet port 25p that is in fluid communication with the cover member port 721<br>
that can continuously or episodically feed dry powder into the flow channel 710f.<br>
Although particularly suitable for pharmaceutical dry powders, the methods,<br>
systems and devices contemplated by the present invention may be used to dispense<br>
any desired dry powder, such as toners and the like.<br>
The invention will now be described in more detail in the following non-<br>
limiting examples.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
The data in Tables 2 and 3 were obtained using the apparatus illustrated in<br>
Figure 13. The signal generator was a 200V amplifier. The carrier frequency<br>
selected for the Inhalac 230 dry powder (a dry powder from Meggle Gmbh, •<br>
Wasserburg, Germany, that has a 230 mesh size when sieved by the manufacturer)<br>
was 7500 Hz. The signal (identified as arb 2 signal) used to vibrate the piezoelectric<br>
polymer layer may be selected and/or expressed using one or more of Equations 1-6<br>
herein. The exemplary excitation signal includes the superposition of four modulating<br>
frequencies ranging from 10-15 Hz.<br>
The foregoing is illustrative of the present invention and is not to be construed<br>
as limiting thereof. Although a few exemplary embodiments of this invention have<br>
been described, those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that many modifications<br>
are possible in the exemplary embodiments without materially departing from the<br>
