Method and Architecture for Interworking of Standardised Networks<br>
Background of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method for performing interworking of a standardised wireless communication network, particularly but not limited to a WiMAX network, and a standardised cellular network, particularly but not limited to a 3GPP or 3GPP2 core network.<br>
The present invention also relates to network elements for use in intenwork-ing of a standardised wireless communication network and a standardised cellular network, such as a WiMAX network and a 3GPP/3GPP2 core net¬work, respectively.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention relates to a communication system com¬prising a standardised wireless communication network including at least one base station for connecting of at least one user equipment and a stan¬dardised cellular network operatively connected for interworking with said standardised wireless communication network, as well as to a computer program product for use in an intenworking communication systenn of the above-mentioned type.<br>
Interworking of different types of standardised networks, i.e. standardised wireless communication networks and a standardised cellular networks, such as wireless Microwave Access (WiMAX) networks and 3rd Generation Partnership {3GPP) networks, respectively, is an important issue in commu¬nication technology.<br>
114628<br>
 <br>
Document ETSI TS 123 234 V6.7.0 (2005-12): "Universal Mobile Telecom¬munications System {UMTS}; 3GPP System to Wireless Local Area Net¬work (WLAN) Intenworking; System Description (3GPP TS 23.234 version 6.7.0 Release 6)" discloses a standardised approach to intenworlting of 3GPP and WLAN networks. It has been proposed to reuse the above-mentioned intenworking approach with respect to 3GPP-WiMAX intenwork-ing. However, such an approach suffers from important drawbacks:<br>
Reusing the above-mentioned 3GPP WLAN interworking solution would mean using Virtual Private Network (VPN)-like tunnels from a (mobile) user equipment (UE) to a Packet Data Gateway (PDG) of the 3GPP network, which is net well suited for a WiMAX context, as said VPN-like tunnels are based on Internet Key Exchange version 2 (iKEv2) and Internet Protocol Security (iPSec) implementations: IKEv2 performs cyclic keep aiive which will forbid a WiMAX terminal to enter in an idle mode, thus requiring addi¬tional signalling over the radio link in conjunction with excess terminal power consumption. IPSec, on the other hand, is unuseful, because WiMAX al¬ready offers a secured end-to-end solution, so that additional IPSec encryp-tation/integrity over WiMAX will only produce overhead communication on the WiMAX radio link. Additionally, unuseful IPSec requires additional CPU performance in both the terminal and the network, thus leading to increased cost expenditure.<br>
Object of the Invention<br>
It is the object of the present invention to provide a method and communica¬tion system architecture which enable efficient interworking of standardised networks while reducing power consumption, overhead and double encryp¬tion network communication and corresponding system requirements.<br>
 <br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
According to a first aspect of the present invention, the object is achieved by providing a method for performing intenworking of a standardised wireless communication network and a standardised cellular network, comprising the steps of:<br>
-	using a marked service flow over a radio link in the standardised wireless communication network as being dedicated to be sent over the standardised cellular network;<br>
-	transporting said marked service flow in a service flow tunnel in the standardised wireless communication network;<br>
-	mapping said service flow tunnel to an inter-network tunnel from an element of said standardised wireless communication network to an element of said standardised cellular network.<br>
According to a second aspect of the present invention, the object is also achieved a providing a network element for use in interworking of a stan¬dardised wireless communication network and a standardised cellular net¬work, comprising means for receiving service flows from the standardised wireless communication network for detecting a marked service flow being dedicated to be sent over the standardised cellular network among the re¬ceived service flows, and for mapping a tunnel of said marked sen/ice flow to an inter-network tunnel to an element of the standardised cellular net¬work.<br>
According to a third aspect of the present invention, the object is further achieved by providing a network element for use in intenworking of a stan¬dardised wireless communication network and a standardised cellular net¬work, comprising means for a establishing at least one inter-network tunnel<br>
 <br>
with an element of the standardised wireless communication network for mapping a service flow of the standardised wireless communication network marked as dedicated to be sent over the standardised cellular network.<br>
In accordance with a fourth aspect of the present invention, the object is achieved by providing a communication system of the above-mentioned type, further comprising:<br>
-	a first network element in said standardised wireless communication network, comprising means for receiving service flows from the stan¬dardised wireless communication network for detecting a marked service flow being dedicated to be sent over the standardised cellular network among the received service flows, and for mapping a tun-nelof said marked service flow to an inter-network tunnel to an ele¬ment of the standardised cellular network; and<br>
-	a second network element in said standardised cellular network, comprising means for a establishing at least one inter-network tunnel with an element of the standardised wireless communication network for mapping a service flow of the standardised wireless communica¬tion network marked as dedicated to be sent over the standardised cellular network.<br>
In accordance with a fiffh aspect of the present invention, the object is fur¬ther achieved by providing a Computer program product for use in an inter-working communication system including a standardised wireless communi¬cation network and a standardised cellular network, said computer program product comprising program code sequences operable to:<br>
-	use a marked service flow over a radio link of the standardised wire¬less communication network as being dedicated to be sent over the standardised cellular network;<br>
-	transport said marked service flow in a service flow tunnel in the standardised wireless communication network;<br>
 <br>
-    map said service flow tunnel to an inter-network tunnel from an ele¬ment of said standardised wireless communication network to an element of said standardised cellular network, when executed on elements of said communication system.<br>
Thus, in accordance with a general idea underlying the present invention, efficient intenworking of different standardised networks, e.g. 3GPP-WiMAX interworking, is achieved by mapping dedicated tunnels from the standard¬ised wireless communication network to the standardised cellular network. For instance, service flows can be relayed over IEEE 802.16 WMAX radio links to a 3GPP core network. In this context, the present invention makes use of the fact that two sen/ice flows are completely distinguishable be¬tween an end terminal/user equipment and an associated base station or access point for each terminal flow, i. e, data/service flow from a given user equipment.<br>
For the above example, IEEE service flows correspond to tunnels over a WMAX radio link. The inventive idea therefore consists in mapping the 3GPP tunnel concept (Packet Data Protocol (PDP) concept) directly in cor¬respondence with the above-described IEEE service flow concept and to tunnel said service flows through the WiMAX network to the 3GPP core network.<br>
In order to signal a terminal service flow to be mapped to the standardised cellular network, in a further embodiment of the method in accordance with the present invention the step of marking the service flow in the standard¬ised wireless communication network is performed by including signalling information for use in the standardised cellular network into a service flow management signalling of the standardised wireless communication net¬work.<br>
 <br>
An embodiment of the method in accordance with the present invention consists in using IEEE 802,16e Global Service Class names for this pur¬pose. Thus, the Global Service Class name associated with a given service flow would contain specific 3GPP POP attributes, such as Access Point Name (APN) and/or Network Sen/ice Access Point Identifier (NSAPI).<br>
[HNi]ln another embodiment of the method in accordance with the present in¬vention, the step of mapping the marked service flow is performed using an RFC 2868 tunnelling protocol. The tunnelling according to RFC 2868 is de¬scribed in Network Working Group publication "Radius Attributes for Tunnel Protocol Support", http:\\www.ietf.org\rfc\rfc2868.txt, the contents of which is herewith incorporated by reference into the present document. Using this approach, each service flow of the standardised wireless communication network is mapped to a separate tunnel between said element of the stan¬dardised wireless communication network and said element of the standard¬ised cellular network.<br>
[HN2iln yet another embodiment of the method in accordance with the pre¬sent invention, a plurality of dedicated service flows are mapped by ex¬tended Mobile IP (MIP) tunnelling.<br>
When using a Home Agent, as known from Mobile IP routing, in a corre¬sponding further embodiment of the network element in accordance with said third aspect of the present invention, the latter may include a routing functionality of a home network of a mobile user equipment. In this way, an extended Mobile IP (MIP) solution can be employed, thus enabling to tunnel different service flows per user terminal over MIP,<br>
in a further embodiment of the communication system in accordance with the present invention said first and second network elements are embedded in a single network entity. This way, sen/ice flow tunnelling may be achieved<br>
 <br>
internally within said network entity, thus considerabiy facilitating interwork-ing communication. In connection with the use of a Home Agent additional implementations based on extended Mobile IP and/or micro-mobility con¬cepts can also be employed.<br>
Further advantages and characteristics of the present invention can be gathered from the following description of preferred embodiments given by way of example only with reference to the enclosed drawings. Features mentioned above as well as below can be used in accordance with the in¬vention either individually or in conjunction. The embodiments mentioned are not to be understood as an exhaustive enumeration but rather as exam¬ples with regard to the underlying concept of the present invention.<br>
Drawings<br>
Fig. 1 is a schematic block diagram of a first embodiment of a communi¬cation system in accordance with the present invention;<br>
Fig. 2 is a schematic block diagram of a second embodiment of a com¬munication system in accordance with the present invention; and<br>
Fig. 3 is a schematic block diagram of a third embodiment of a commu¬nication system in accordance with the present invention; and<br>
Peg. 1 shows a schematic block diagram of an embodiment of a communi¬cation system 1 in accordance with the present invention. The communica¬tion system 1 generally comprises a standardised wireless communication network in the form of a WiMAX network 2 and a standardised cellular net¬work in the form of a 3G core network 3, which are operatively connected for interworking. Additionally, in accordance with the embodiment shown the<br>
 <br>
communication system 1 further comprises a further network in the form of an IP network/internet 4,<br>
In the WiMAX network section 2, the communication system 1 comprises at least one mobile terminal 5, also referred to as mobile station (MS) or user equipment (UE). Furthermore, the WiMAX network 2 comprises a number of base stations (BS) 6, also referred to as access points. The base stations 6 are connected with an Access Server Node Gateway (ASN-GW) 7, also re¬ferred to as Wimax Access Controler (WAG), which functions as a router for transmissions from a number of base stations 6, as shown. According to the embodiment of Fig. 1, the WAG 7 comprises means 7a for receiving sen/ice flows from the WiMAX network 2, means 7b for detecting a marked service flow being dedicated to be sent over the 3G core network 3 among the re¬ceived service flows, and means 7c for mapping a tunnel of said marked service flow to an inter-network tunnel to an element of the 30 core network 3. At least some or all of said means 7a-c can be devised in software form. The functioning of said means 7a-c will become apparent later. However, it should already be noted here that according to the present invention means 7a-c may also be (alternatively) embedded in one of base stations 6.<br>
In the 3G network section, also referred to as 3"^ Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) network, the communication system 1 comprises at least a first network element 8, in the following referred to as Tunnel Termination Gateway (TTG), a second network element 9, in the following referred to as Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN). Second network element 9 is operatively connected with a Packet Data Network (PDN) 10 , i.e.. an IP network.<br>
Furthermore, the communication system 1 of Fig, 1 comprises another ele¬ment 11 referred to as Home Agent (HA). As further indicated in Fig. 1, TTG 8 comprises means 8a for establishing at least one inter-network tunnel of the WiMAX network 2 for mapping a WiMAX service flow marked as dedi-<br>
 <br>
cated to be sent over the 3G core network 3, the functioning of which will become apparent later. Said means 8a are preferably devised in software form.<br>
The functioning of the above-mentioned elements of communication system 1 will now be explained to some extent in connection with an operation of the shown embodiment of the communication system 1 in accordance with the present invention:<br>
In the intenworking scenario considered here, user equipment 5 first sends a Dynamic Service Addition (DBA) request for service flow addition to base station 6, as indicated by means of horizontal arrow marked DSA in Fig. 1. As further indicated in Fig. 1, said DSA request may be for addition of non-3GPP service flow 12.1 and/or for addition of 3GPP service flow 13.1 (cf. below). Upon reception of DSA request from user equipment 5, base station 6 sends out a further DSA request for service flow addition to WAC 7, as in¬dicated by means of horizontal arrow DSA' in Fig. 1. WAC 7 then issues a Tunnel Initiation Request, preferably but not limited to a RFC 2868 Tunnel Initiation Request, to TTG 8 situated in the 3GPP network 3. In Fig. 1, said Tunnel Initiation Request is indicated by means of horizontal arrow RFC 2868. TTG 8 then sends a Packet Data Protocol (PDP) context activation message to GGSN 9, as indicated by means of horizontal arrow PDP in Fig. 1.<br>
As a consequence of the above-described transmission of requests DSA, DSA', RFC 2868, PDP a number of service flow tunnels are established re¬spectively within and between WiMAX network 2 and 3GPP network 3. As already stated above, service flow tunnels 12,1, 13.1 fornon-3GPP service flow and 3GPP service flow, respectively, are established over a radio link between user equipment 5 and base station 6. Base station 6 then relays said service flows to WAC 7 via service flow tunnel 12.2 for non-3GPP ser-<br>
 <br>
vice flow and service flow tunnel 13.2 dedicated for the 3GPP service flow and marked accordingly. In WAC 7, said marked service flow 13.2 is re¬ceived and detected among a totality of received service flows 12.2, 13.2 by receiving means 7a and detecting means 7b, respectively.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, said marking of a service flow over the radio link as "3GPP service flow" intended for mapping to the 3GPP network 3 can be achieved in a variety of ways: Preferably, Global Service Class names as described in specification IEEE 802,16e may be used.<br>
Such an approach has been described fn European Patent Appiication 05292696.1 ("Method for 3GPP-WiMAX interworking") filed 13 December 2005 in the name of the present applicant, the entire contents of which is herewith incorporated by reference into the present document.<br>
Accordingly, a Global Service Class name associated with a given service flow will comprise certain 3GPP PDP attributes, e. g., an Access Point Name (APN) and/or Network Service Access Point Identifier (NSAPI) are added to the Global Service Class name in order to signal in the \MMAX network 2 a terminal service flow which has to be mapped with the 3GPP core network 3. Alternatively, other approaches may be used to exchange 3GPP PDP signalling between the WiMAX user equipment 5 and the Wi-MAX network 2: For instance, a specific service flow may be used together with 3GPP GPRS session management (SM), like Protocol over IP.<br>
In a subsequent step, the WiWAX network 2 relays received and detected service flow tunnel 13.2 together with the above-mentioned 3GPP PDP at¬tributes to said first network element 8 (TTG) of 3GPP core network 3 using mapping means 7c. In this context, service flow tunnel 13-2 to be mapped can also be referred to as "per service flow" tunnel, since every service flow is being tunnelled individually from the user equipment 5 to TTG 8.<br>
 <br>
A standard configuration and functioning of TTG 8 is described in 3GPP TS 23.234 Release 6 (cf. above) and is assumed to be known to a person skilled in the art. In the context of the shown embodiment, in accordance with the present invention TTG functionality is extended to enable additional tunnel signalling and data tunnelling with respect to standard TTG function¬ality. In the shown embodiments, this can be achieved by suitably devising said means 8a for establishing an inter-network tunnel with WAG 7 com¬prised in TTG 8, preferably by providing corresponding program code se¬quences thereto.<br>
In an alternative to the embodiment shown in Fig. 1, the functionality of re¬ceiving service flows, detecting a marked service flow among the received service flows and of mapping a tunnel of said marked service flow per¬formed respectively by means 7a-c comprised in WAG 7, said functionality can be performed by corresponding means {not shown) included in base station 6, as will be appreciated by a person skilled in the art.<br>
In Fig. 1, service flow tunnel 13.3 established for mapping/relaying of ser¬vice flow tunnel 13,2 to TTG 8 corresponds to said inter-network tunnel es¬tablished between an element (WAG 7) of WiMAX network 2 and an ele¬ment {TTG 8) of 3GPP core network 3. Preferably, service flow tunnel 13,3 is devised as an RFC 2868 tunnel, TTG 8 then relays the service flow on 3GPP PDP tunnel 13.4 to GGSN 9 and eventually to other elements within 3GPP core network 3,<br>
As will be appreciated by a person skilled in the art, the non-3GPP service flow initiated on sen/ice flow tunnel 12.1 and further relayed to WAG 7 via service flow tunnel 12.2 is managed normally according to WiMAX fashion by further relaying to the IP network/internet 4 on MS Mobile IP (MIR) tunnel<br>
 <br>
12.3 and IP flow tunnel 12.4 via Home Agent (HA) 11, as known to a person skilled in the art.<br>
In this way, a communication system 1 in accordance with the present in¬vention by means of network element WAC 7 / base station 6 and network element TTG 8 achieves relaying service flows over IEEE 802.16/WiMAX radio links from WiMAX network 2 to 3GPP core network 3, wherein two sen/ice flows 12.1,13,1, i. e. non-3GPP service flows and 3GPP service flows, respectively, are completely distinguishable between a mobile termi¬nal 5 and an associated base station 6 for every terminal flow. In this con¬text, IEEE service Rows correspond to tunnels over the WiMAX radio link. As described in detail above, the basic idea in accordance with the present invention consists in mapping the 3GPP tunnelling concept, i. e. PDP con¬cept, in correspondence with said WiMAX service flow concept and to tun¬nel said WiMAX service flows through the WiMAX network to the 3GPP core network.<br>
Fig. 2 is a schematic block diagram of a second embodiment of a communi¬cation system 1' in accordance with the present invention. Elements of the communication system 1' corresponding or similar in configuration and/or function to elements of the communication system 1 of Fig. 1 have been as¬signed the same reference numerals. For reasons of simplicity, non-3GPP service flows have not been included in Fig. 2.<br>
The communication system 1' of Fig, 2 comprises a user equipment 5 operatively connected with WAC 7 via base station 6, Base station 6 and WAC 7 constitute WiMAX network 2, 3GPP core network 3 of Fig. 2 com¬prises at least GGSN 9 and a further element 14 including merged Home Agent (HA) 11 and tunnel termination gateway (TTG) 8 {cf. Fig, 1), In this case, as shown in Fig, 2, an extended Mobile IP (MIP) solution may be em¬ployed: The "per service flow" tunnel for 3GPP service flows interconnecting<br>
 <br>
different standardised networks 2, 3 is devised in the form of an extended MIP tunnel 15 enabling to tunnel different flows (e.g., 3GPP service flows and non-3GPP service flows) per mobile terminal/user equipment 5 over MIP to ttie 3GPP network 3.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a schematic block diagram of a third embodiment of a com¬munication system 1" in accordance with the present invention. Again, In Fig. 3 the same reference numerals have been used to designate elements of similar configuration and/or functionality with respect to the description of figs. 1 and 2.<br>
The communication system 1" of Fig. 3 comprises a user equipment 5 operatively connected with a base station 6 of WiMAX network 2. 3GPP core network 3 comprises at least GGSN 9, Intenworking of WiMAX network 2 and 3GPP core network 3 is achieved by means of a further element 16 functioning as an interface between WiMAX networlt 2 and 3GPP core net¬work 3, wherein said element 16 effectively includes functionality of both WAC 7 and TTG 8, as indicated in Fig. 3. In other words, according to the embodiment of Fig. 3, the TTG 8 has been embedded in the WAC 7, so that a "per service flow" tunnel interconnecting different standardised networks 2, 3 may be devised internally within said element 16 by any suitable means{HN3], Furthermore, in the embodiment of Fig. 3, there is a Home Agent (HA) 11 in operative connection with the combined WAC 7 / TTG 8 {of. figs. 1,2).<br>
within this case a GPRS Tunnelling Protocoi (GTP) tunnelling used between WAC-TTG 16 and GGSN 9 preferably is an extended GTP tunnelling, which as such does not form part of the present invention.<br>
[HN5]Alternatively (case not shown in Figs 1 through 3), TTG 8 and GGSN 9 could be embedded in one common network entity, thus constituting Packet<br>
 <br>
Data Gateway (PDG) of the 3GPP network. This is equivalent to saying that the protocols used at interfaces to the WiMAX network are standard IKEv2 and IPSec. in this particular case, entity 7 (WAC) functions as an IKEv2 / IPSec client and perfornns mapping with said marked service flows over a radio link in the standardised wireless communication network, i.e. the Wi¬MAX network.<br>
This way, a method and architecture for intenworking of different standard¬ised networks, in particular 3G-WiMAX interworking, is achieved which does not rely on reusing Release 6 3GPP-WI_AN interworking solutions, which would mean employing VPN-like tunnels from a user equipment to the PDG, i. e. the TTG, which are not particularly well matched with the WiiVIAX con¬text.<br>
