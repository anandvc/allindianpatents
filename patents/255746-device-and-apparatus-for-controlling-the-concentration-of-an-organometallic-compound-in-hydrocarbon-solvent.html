				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a chemical process control system and method for<br>
monitoring and controlling the concentration of an alkyllithium feed solution to an<br>
industrial process.<br>
	BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Organometallic compounds such as alkyllithium compounds are widely used<br>
in industry as precursors, initiators, and catalysts for the formation of a variety of<br>
products. For instance, butyl lithium compounds are used as polymerization initiators<br>
and as strong bases for organic synthesis.<br>
N-butyl lithium is the most widely used initiator for anionic polymerization,<br>
and is used in the production of polymers such as styrenic thermoplastic elastomers<br>
and random styrene-butadiene rubber solution polymers for use in automobile tires.<br>
N-butyJ^Hthjum is also used as a strong base in organic synthesis to improve yields<br>
and throughput of reactions, with particular effectiveness in deprotonation and metal-<br>
halogen exchange reactions. Sec-butyl and tert-butyl lithium compositions are also<br>
used as polymerization initiators and strong bases for organic synthesis, but each of<br>
the lithium compounds has slightly different properties than n-butyl lithium.<br>
Many organometallic compositions, particularly alkyllithium compositions,<br>
ignite on contact with water. Butyl lithium compounds, for instance, may even ignite<br>
upon contact with the moisture found in air. Therefore, extraordinary precautions<br>
must be taken during the production, transportation, and storage of organometallic<br>
compounds.<br>
Because of their reactivity with water, the organometallic compounds are<br>
transported and maintained in a hydrocarbon solution until ready for use. Butyl<br>
lithium compositions may be maintained in hydrocarbon solutions such as<br>
cyclohexane. The compositions are typically produced in custom concentrations<br>
depending on the requirements of the end user, and shipments of the custom<br>
concentrations are usually made on a regular basis from the organometallic<br>
production site to the end user. Each shipment of organometallic presents safety<br>
issues because the organometallic cannot be exposed to water at any point. Further,<br><br>
administrative requirements of legal and environmental authorities accumulate with<br>
each shipment.<br>
Because of the burden associated with each shipment of organometallic<br>
materials, it is advantageous to ship the organometallies, such as alkyllithium, in high<br>
concentrations so as to minimize the volume of each shipment. Alkyllithium, such as<br>
butyl lithium, may be shipped in concentrations as high as 95% in hydrocarbon<br>
solution. However, industry typically uses the alkyllithiums in concentrations of<br>
about 15% to about 19%, and most processes are incapable of handling high-<br>
concentration alkyllithium compositions.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention is an apparatus and method for allowing the industrial use of a<br>
supply of organometallic compositions, particularly alkyllithium compositions, with<br>
processes requiring low-concentration organometallic feeds. The invention accepts a<br>
feed of concentrated organometallic solution and selectively dilutes the concentrated<br>
feed by controlled dilution of the feed with a solvent to produce an organometallic<br>
stream of a reduced concentration.<br>
When used with alkyllithium, the invention blends a supply of alkyllithium<br>
solution with a supply of hydrocarbon solvent. The concentration of alkyllithium<br>
within the blend is analyzed using spectroscopic analysis and the measured or<br>
calculated concentration of alkyllithium is determined. The concentration value is<br>
communicated to a control means which compares the actual concentration value with<br>
a previously determined desired concentration value and, based upon the difference in<br>
the determined and desired concentration values, adjusts the rate of supply of the<br>
alkyllithium solution, the rate of supply of the hydrocarbon solvent, or the rate of<br>
supply of both the alkyllithium solution and the solvent.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention now will be described more fully hereinafter with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawings, in which preferred embodiments of the<br>
invention are shown. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different<br>
forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein;<br>
rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and<br>
complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art.<br>
Like numbers refer to like elements throughout.<br>
The various components of the instant invention may be arranged in a number<br>
of different ways, each of which accomplish the main object of the invention, i.e. to<br>
supply a consistent and precise concentration of an organometallic in a hydrocarbon -<br>
solvent.<br>
Each of the embodiments below exemplifies a system which, in some manner,<br>
does the following: supply a flow of hydrocarbon solvent, supply a flow of an<br>
organometallic composition which is preferably an alkyllithium composition in a<br>
hydrocarbon medium, mix the organometallic with the solvent in order to dilute the<br>
organometallic solution, quantitatively measure the properties of the diluted<br>
organometallic solution using spectroscopic analysis, and using a process control to<br>
vary one or more of the parameters of the system based upon the results of the<br>
spectroscopic analysis to obtain a desired quantitative aspect of the blended<br>
organometallic which is released from the system. The details of the invention will be<br>
expressed with respect to alkyllithium components specifically though the invention is<br>
equally applicable to organometallic compositions.<br><br>
Various hydrocarbon solvents are used with the invention. In general, a first<br>
hydrocarbon solvent or mixture of solvents is supplied in pure or nearly pure form for<br>
use in diluting a stream of alkyllithium solution. The alkyllithium solution to be<br>
, diluted is supplied as a solution of alkyllithium with a second hydrocarbon solvent,<br>
which may also be a mixture of solvents. For ease of description, the solvent, which<br>
is pure or nearly pure, is simply described as the "hydrocarbon solvent". The<br>
hydrocarbon solvent that holds the alkyllithium in solution is referred to as the<br>
"hydrocarbon medium". In a circumstance where both solvents contain alkyllithium,<br>
the solvent containing the lower concentration of alkyllithium is referred to as the<br>
"hydrocarbon solvent".<br>
A supply of hydrocarbon solvent is provided to the invented system and may<br>
be any of a wide number of hydrocarbon compounds typically used as solvents which<br>
are preferably liquid between the processing temperatures of from about 0°C to about<br>
80°C, including alkanes, cycloalkanes, and aromatic hydrocarbons. The hydrocarbon<br>
solvent may be a mixture of two or more solvents, and the solvent is substantially free<br>
of contaminants, such as water and alcohol. As mentioned, water reacts with many<br>
organometallic compounds, with a potentially explosive evolution of heat. Alcohols<br>
also react with many organometallic compounds. It is therefore necessary that the<br>
 combined content of water and alcohols be kept below a level of 1000 parts per<br>
million (ppm) of the solvent.<br>
Exemplary hydrocarbon solvents are cyclohexane and mixtures of<br>
cyclohexane and n-heptane. The hydrocarbon solvent is typically supplied from a<br>
large container and may be supplied by gravity or through the use of a pump.<br>
A supply of alkyllithium is provided to the invented system in a hydrocarbon<br>
medium, with the alkyllithium component typically present in an amount from about<br>
10 wt% to about 90 wt% of the mixture. However, the invention is not so limited and<br>
the alkyllithium can be present in smaller or larger concentrations. The alkyllithium<br>
is provided as a solution for several reasons. First, pure alkyllithium is extremely<br>
pyrophoric, meaning that it reacts violently with water, including the moisture in air.<br>
The hydrocarbon component of the solution lowers the concentration of alkyllithium<br>
at the air interface, thereby lowering the overall reactivity of the solution with air.<br>
Further, the liquid hydrocarbon provides a medium in which the alkyllithium may be<br>
easily transported, i.e. pumped, piped, moved, or stored.<br><br>
If the present invention is used in a chemical plant capable of producing<br>
alkyllithium, the supply of alkyllithium solution may result from a reactor or a storage<br>
unit associated therewith. More typically, the alkyllithium solution is supplied to a<br>
site remotely located from the production source of alkyllithium. The alkyllithium<br>
solution can be supplied to such sites in canisters from about 30 L (liters) to about<br>
20,000 L from an alkyllithium supplier such as FMC Lithium Division, although<br>
smaller or larger sized containers can be used.<br>
The present invention is applicable to organometallic compounds, in general,<br>
but finds particular application to alkyllithium compositions. As used herein,<br>
alkyllithium compositions are generally defined as those compositions having the<br>
formula RLi where R is from one to twelve carbons. Preferred alkyllithium<br>
compositions are methyllithium, ethyllithium, n-propyllithium, 2-propyllithium, n-<br>
butyllithium, s-butyllithium, t-butyliithium, n-hexyllithium, 2-ethylhexyllithium, 1 -<br>
octyllithium, and mixtures thereof, supplied at concentrations of 10 wt% to 90 wt%<br>
hydrocarbon medium. Other organometallic compounds which may be used in<br>
accordance with the invention include lithium diisopropylamide and<br>
dibutylmagnesium.<br>
The supply of alkyllithium solution is blended with the supply of hydrocarbon<br>
solvent. The mixing may be accomplished with a variety of mixing means. In<br>
general, most industrially known means of mixing and agitating a low-viscosity<br>
solution may be used. For instance, the mixing means may be a tank, baffled or<br>
unbaffled, having one or more impellers directing the flow of solution in either an<br>
axial or radial direction with respect to the impeller. Preferably, the mixer is a static<br>
mixer, which is a chamber having a series of stationary baffles or conduits which<br>
force the liquids to mix with themselves as they flow through the mixer. Use of the<br>
mixer ensures homogeneity of the mixture prior to downstream spectroscopic<br>
analysis. Mixing allows combination of the alkyllithium solution and the<br>
hydrocarbon stream in ratios from about 20:1 to about 1:20.<br>
The energy for the mixing process is provided by pressure, derived from a<br>
pump or a static pressure system, such as compressed gas. Alternatively, a small<br>
pump provides increased pressure to the combined stream of alkyllithium solution and<br>
hydrocarbon solvent prior to the mixing process. It is preferred that all tanks, supply<br>
lines, and mixers of the process be kept under continuous positive pressure with<br>
nitrogen so that air is not allowed to enter the alkyllithium system through failed<br><br>
mechanical components or otherwise. The pressures of the liquids and the flow rates<br>
throughout the invented system may be adjusted to suit the end-user's process<br>
requirements.<br>
After mixing, properties of the blended alkyllithium stream are quantitatively<br>
measured with spectroscopic analysis. For such analysis, the blended alkyllithium is<br>
analyzed downstream of the mixer, either by removing a small stream of the blended<br>
alkyllithium and circulating the stream through a spectroscopic cell or by directly<br>
analyzing the main blended alkyllithium stream. A spectroscopic cell is a device<br>
consisting of a light conducting component that receives light from a light source and<br>
transmits a particular or several particular wavenumbers of light through the sample<br>
and a second light-conducting component capable of receiving the transmitted<br>
wavenumbers of light after they have traveled through the sample.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, a portion of the blended alkyllithium<br>
stream is diverted away from the main stream and circulated through a spectroscopic<br>
cell. The diverted stream is preferably handled in a fast loop sample system that<br>
transports the sample quickly from the blended alkyllithium stream to the<br>
spectroscopic cell. Since the stream of blended alkyllithium leaving the mixer is<br>
under at least minimal pressure, the diverted stream of blended alkyllithium may<br>
simply be drawn from the main stream, circulated through the spectroscopic cell, and<br>
replaced in the main stream of blended alkyllithium. Alternatively, a small pump may<br>
be used to propel the side stream of blended alkyllithium to and/or from the<br>
spectroscopic cell.<br>
Analysis of a diverted side stream of blended alkyllithium allows for the<br>
blended alkyllithium stream to optionally be analyzed under temperature-controlled<br>
conditions, resulting in a more accurate analysis. The spectroscopic equipment is<br>
calibrated to analyze samples at a particular temperature, typically 35°C, and variance<br>
from the calibration temperature may result in error within the readings. The main<br>
blended alkyllithium process stream typically has a reasonably consistent temperature<br>
and may be used as a point for direct analysis. However, insuring the temperature of<br>
the sample under temperature controlled conditions gives a relatively more reliable<br>
reading than a sample where temperature is not controlled within tight tolerances.<br>
After diversion from the main stream, the diverted blended alkyllithium is heated or<br>
cooled to the optimum temperature for analysis by the particular spectroscopic<br>
equipment being used. It is preferable that the spectroscopic cell and related<br><br>
spectroscopic equipment be maintained in a temperature controlled enclosure and that<br>
the temperature of the alkyllithium sample be optimized prior to analysis. A small<br>
heat exchanger may be used, if needed, to exchange heat between the diverted<br>
alkyllithium streams entering and exiting the temperature controlled spectroscopic<br>
analysis enclosure.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, a spectroscopic cell is used to analyze<br>
the properties of the blended alkyllithium directly from the flow of alkyllithium<br>
downstream of the mixer. In this arrangement, the entire stream of blended<br>
alkyllithium flows through a spectroscopic cell which is designed so that the blended<br>
alkyllithium is allowed to flow in one direction through the cell while one or more<br>
wavenumbers of light are projected by a light source from one side of the cell to the<br>
other, perpendicular or nearly perpendicular to the flow of the alkyllithium.<br>
Referring to Figure 1, a spectroscopic cell for use in analyzing an in-line flow<br>
of blended alkyllithium typically comprises a section of stainless steel pipe Having<br>
walls 50 connected to the main blended alkyllithium piping system via fittings 52<br>
downstream of the mixer. A first fiber optic element 60 is releasably connected to the<br>
side of the cell via a fiber optic fitting 70. Either the first fiber optic element 60 or an<br>
additional fiber optic element in communication with element 60 passes through the<br>
cell wall 50 and is supported within the cell by first fiber optic support 72. A second<br>
fiber optic element 62 is releasably connected to the side of the cell opposite the first<br>
fiber optic element 60 via a second fiber optic fitting 74. Either the second optic<br>
element 62 or an additional fiber optic element in communication with element 62<br>
passes through the cell wall 50 and is supported within the cell by a second fiber optic<br>
support 76. End portions 80, 82 of the first and second fiber optic elements 60, 62 are<br>
positioned within the cell and spaced approximately 1 mm from one another. The end<br>
portions 80, 82 are preferably sapphire elements which are fixed in place within the<br>
support members 72, 76, and which are in operable communication with the fiber<br>
optic elements 60, 62. Sapphire is an exemplary material for use with analysis using<br>
infra-red (IR) wavenumbers, as the sapphire is transparent to most wavenumbers in<br>
the IR spectrum.<br>
In operation, the blended alkyllithium flows through the spectroscopic cell and<br>
a portion of the flowing alkyllithium passes through the narrow opening left between<br>
the two end elements 80,82. Light from an IR source is transmitted through the optic<br>
cable 60, through the end element 80, and through a sample of alkyllithium, which<br><br>
flows through the small void between the end elements 80,82. The IR light that has<br>
passed through the sample is received by the second end element 82 and conducted<br>
through the second optic element 62 to a detector.<br>
	Referring to Figure 2, a spectroscopic cell may alternatively be configured for<br>
analyzing a side stream of alkyllithium taken from the main blended stream. An<br>
extractive sample flow cell is analogous to the in-line flow cell. A small diameter<br>
tube 50 is disposed through the cell housing 84. The small diameter tube 50 carries a<br>
low volume of sampled alkyllithium from the main blended alkyllithium piping<br>
system, through the cell, and back to the main system. A fiber optic element 60 is<br>
held in place by a connector 70 attached to the cell housing 84. A second fiber optic<br>
element 62 is held in place by a connector 74 attached to the cell housing 84 opposite<br>
the first connector 70. The fiber optic elements 60,62 protrude through the walls of<br>
the cell housing 84 and converge at optical windows 80,82 which face one another<br>
from opposing sides of the flow tube 50. The windows 80,82 may form part of the<br>
wall of the flow tube 50, allowing light to be transmitted directly from one window<br>
80, across the sample, to the second window 82. Alternatively, the optical windows<br>
80,82 are spaced at the outside diameter of the flow tube 50 and the flow tube is<br>
constructed of a IR light transparent material in the proximity of the windows 80,82,<br>
so that light may transmitted from the first window 80, through the tube 50 wall,<br>
through the sample, through the tube 50 wall opposing the first tube 50 wall, and into<br>
the second window 82.<br>
In operation, a low volumetric flow of blended alkyllithium is extracted from<br>
the main supply of blended alkyllithium of the process. The extracted alkyllithium<br>
flows through the flow tube 50 of the spectroscopic cell and the alkyllithium passes<br>
between the optical windows 80,82. Light from an IR source is transmitted through<br>
the optic cable 60, through the first window 80, and through the sample of<br>
alkyllithium within the pipe. The IR light that has passed through the sample is<br>
received by the second window 82 and conducted through the second optic element<br>
62 to a detector.<br>
The spectroscopic cells have means for manually or automatically introducing<br>
wash fluids and standardized samples into the cells. The regular use of standardized<br>
samples allows for calibration of the spectroscopic equipment.<br>
A direct spectroscopic insertion probe, also known as an immersion probe, is a<br>
variation of the spectroscopic cell that may be used with the invented system. The<br><br>
insertion probe is a cell which may be inserted into a tank or process stream and<br>
which enables the analysis of fluid directly surrounding the probe. Unless otherwise<br>
specified, the insertion probe may be used in place of a standard spectroscopic cell in<br>
any of the applications described herein.<br>
The spectroscopic cells are operatively connected to a spectrometer. A<br>
spectrometer is a device having a light source, a mechanical means for splitting or<br>
manipulating the light from the light source, and a detector that receives light and<br>
translates light into an electronic signal. The light source produces a sample of light<br>
that is split into various wavelengths by the mechanical splitting means. For simple<br>
IR spectrometry, the splitting means is often a diffraction grating. For a more<br>
complex FTIR apparatus, the splitting means encompasses a series of mirrors that<br>
move with respect to one another. Whatever light is produced from the light source,<br>
to the splitting means is transmitted to the splitting means and finally to the<br>
spectroscopic cell via a fiber optic element 60.	<br>
Manipulated light from the spectrometer is projected via fiber optic cells to a<br>
spectroscopic cell as described above. The detector of the spectrometer receives light<br>
that has been transmitted through the spectroscopic cell via an optical element. The<br>
detector is a photoelectric, or similar, device that transforms the light signals received<br>
from the optical element into an electrical signal that is representative of the<br>
characteristics of the light received by the detector. The spectrometer combines the<br>
electronic information received from the detector with information concerning the -<br>
spectrum of light being transmitted, the status of the interferometer, and other data<br>
concerning the amount and type of radiation transmitted through the sample and<br>
absorbed by the detector. The compiled information is either interpreted within the<br>
spectrometer unit or is transmitted to a spectroscopic analyzer, such as a personal<br>
computer or other device that may be used to interpret the electronic data.<br>
Spectrometers are commercially available. An example of a commercially available<br>
unit is the MB 160 FT-NIR unit by ABB of Quebec, Canada.<br>
The spectroscopic information from the spectrometer is typically transmitted<br>
to a spectroscopic analyzer. The spectroscopic analyzer is a microprocessor based<br>
analytical device that interprets the raw spectroscopic data from the spectrometer and<br>
translates the information into a format that is usable for process control or<br>
understandable by a process operator. Typically, the spectroscopic analyzer is a<br>
Personal Computer loaded with appropriate software. The computer and software<br><br>
perform mathematical operations upon the spectroscopic data in order to develop a<br>
spectral analysis of the data. The spectroscopic analysis of most forms of<br>
spectroscopic equipment, i.e. NMR, UV-visible light, and simple IR, result in a plot<br>
of intensity of radiation versus frequency of radiation. The analyzer and associated<br>
software compare the spectrum plot with previously inputted data to determine the<br>
concentration of the components being analyzed and the identity of impurities. In the<br>
instant invention, the components being analyzed are organometallic compounds,<br>
particularly alkyllithiums, along with the solvent or solvents being used to hold the<br>
organometallic in solution. Impurities to be identified include water, alcohols,<br>
oxygen, and any other substances not normally found in the dilution process.<br>
Spectroscopic analysis units and analytic software are commercially available.<br>
The spectrometer and spectroscopic analysis components of the invention are<br>
preferably Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FTIR) or Fourier Transform Nearlnfra- Red<br>
(FT-NIR) spectroscopy components. A typical FTIR comprises a stabilized infrared<br>
light source, an interferometer, a beam splitter, and a detector array. Instead of<br>
spatially separating the optical frequencies using a device such as a diffraction<br>
grating, the FTIR modulates all wavelengths simultaneously with distinct modulation<br>
frequencies for each wavelength. The modulation is accomplished by a variable<br>
interference effect created by separating the near infrared beam into two and then<br>
introducing a path difference before recombining the beams at the detector after<br>
passing through the sample.<br>
The manipulated light is transmitted to the spectroscopic cell via low OH fiber<br>
optic cables. The light is transmitted from the fiber optic cable, through the sample of<br>
blended alkyllithium, and to a second fiber optic cable. The detector absorbs the IR<br>
radiation from the second optic cable, and emits an electronic signal. This electronic<br>
signal is then transmitted to an FTIR analyzer.<br>
The electrical signal from the detector corresponds to the beam intensity of the<br>
FTIR, which is a function of the optical path difference and is called an interferogram.<br>
The analyzer performs a Fourier transform mathematical operation upon the<br>
interferogram, resulting in a calculated intensity vs. frequency spectrum that may be<br>
compared to a desired spectrum corresponding to a desired concentration of<br>
alkyllithium within the blended alkyllithium stream. An example of an analyzer for<br>
use with FTIR spectra is a Pentium™ based Personal Computer loaded with Bomem<br>
Grams/32 spectral acquisition software and PLSplus/IQ PLS algorithm modeling<br><br>
software, both by Thermo Galactic Industries Corporation of Salem, New Hampshire.<br>
PLS, or Partial Least Squares Regression, is the preferred method of analysis of FTIR<br>
determined spectral data. Based upon differences in the calculated spectrum and the<br>
 spectrum corresponding to the previous samples used for calibration of the<br>
spectroscopic equipment, the analyzer determines the concentration of alkyllithium<br>
within the sampled stream.<br>
Though FTIR spectroscopy is the preferred analytical tool of the invention,<br>
any spectroscopic equipment capable of quantitative analysis using wavenumbers<br>
corresponding to organometallic compounds may be used in accordance with this<br>
invention.<br>
A controller receives an analog or digital electronic input from the analyzer<br>
that corresponds to the measured alkyllithium concentration of the blended stream.<br>
The controller compares the determined concentration of the blended alkyllithium to<br>
the desired concentration of alkyllithium that is predetermined for usewith a<br>
particular process. Based upon the difference in values of the determined and desired<br>
concentrations, the control unit adjusts the feed rates of the alkyllithium source, the<br>
solvent source, or both in accordance with the input received from the analyzer. In<br>
this manner, a control loop is established whereby the concentration of the blended<br>
alkyllithium stream may be repeatedly or continuously monitored and adjusted in<br>
order to maintain a constant concentration of alkyllithium as an output from the<br>
invented system.<br>
The light source, light splitting means, and detector is typically housed within<br>
a common unit. However, it is possible for each of the components to be housed<br>
separately. The spectrometer is in communication with the analyzer, and the analyzer<br>
is, likewise, in communication with the control apparatus. Communication is<br>
typically provided by an electronic connection. However, the term communication is<br>
simply intended to mean the transfer of data, which may be transmitted in electrical,<br>
optical, or any other form of transmitting and receiving analog or digital data known<br>
in the art.<br>
Referring to Figure 3, one embodiment of the invention provides an in-line<br>
dilution system having an inlet 15 of alkyllithium solution in hydrocarbon medium<br>
and an inlet 10 of a hydrocarbon solvent. The stream of alkyllithium solution<br>
provided by the alkyllithium inlet 15 flows to an alkyllithium flow control valve 16.<br>
Similarly, the stream of hydrocarbon solvent provided by the hydrocarbon inlet 10<br><br>
flows to a hydrocarbon flow control valve 11. After leaving the alkyllithium 16 and<br>
hydrocarbon 11 flow control valves, the respective streams are joined at or just prior<br>
to entering a mixing apparatus 13. The flow of mixed alkyllithium and solvent is<br>
/ transported from the mixing apparatus 13 to a blended alkyllithium outlet 24. In line<br>
with the flow of mixed alkyllithium is a FT-IR spectroscopic cell 12 for measuring the<br>
properties of the mixed alkyllithium between the mixing apparatus 13 and the blended<br>
alkyllithium outlet 24. The FT-IR spectroscopic cell 12 is optically connected with a<br>
combined FT-IR spectrometer/analyzer array 26. Based on quantitative analysis of<br>
the blended alkyllithium stream performed by the array 26, a control device 28 exerts<br>
control over the alkyllithium flow control valve 16 and/or the solvent flow control<br>
valve 11 in order to adjust the actual properties of the blended alkyllithium stream, as<br>
measured by FT-IR analyzer 26, to user defined levels.<br>
The system optionally employs additional spectroscopic cells located in line<br>
with the alkyllithium solution feed and/or the hydrocarbon solvent feed. An<br>
alkyllithium feed spectroscopic cell 22 is optionally positioned either upstream or<br>
downstream of the alkyllithium flow control valve 16. Similarly, a solvent<br>
spectroscopic cell 20 is optionally positioned either upstream or downstream of the<br>
solvent flow control valve 11. These cells 20, 22 function in the same manner as the<br>
main spectroscopic cell 12, but may be used to provide additional information to the<br>
FT-IR analyzer array 26 in order to provide a more detailed analysis of the content of<br>
the feed streams prior to mixing. The initial concentration of alkyllithium within the<br>
alkyllithium feed stream may vary over time as a result of process conditions or<br>
conditions within the alkyllithium storage container. Similarly, the concentration or<br>
composition of the solvent feed may vary over time, particularly if the solvent feed is<br>
a recycled stream from a previous process in which it contained alkyllithium. Use of<br>
additional cells 20, 22 provides additional information to the analyzer array 26 before<br>
the information is reflected in the downstream cell 12, thereby allowing for more<br>
efficient control of the system.<br>
Use of a solvent spectroscopic cell 20 also allows for the qualitative and<br>
quantitative analysis of impurities within the solvent stream. Spectroscopic analysis<br>
is preferably used to analyze the solvent stream for water content. The unique<br>
signature of water within the particular hydrocarbon mixture is easily recognized by<br>
an FTIR or similar spectroscopic apparatus. The water content of the solvent may be<br>
quantitatively measured and the solvent may be diverted from combination with the<br><br>
alkyllithium, manually or automatically, if the water content of the solvent is found to<br>
be unsafe.<br>
Referring to Figure 4, an embodiment of the invention regulates the<br>
concentration of an alkyllithium solution within a stirred tank. The system has an<br>
inlet 15 of alkyllithium in a hydrocarbon medium and an inlet 10 of a hydrocarbon<br>
solvent. The stream of alkyllithium solution provided by the alkyllithium inlet 15<br>
flows to an alkyllithium flow control valve 16. Similarly, the stream of hydrocarbon<br>
solvent provided by the hydrocarbon inlet 10 flows to a hydrocarbon flow control<br>
valve 11. Both the stream of alkyllithium and the stream of solvent flow into a stirred<br>
vessel 30. The vessel 30 is closed to the environment so as to prevent moisture from<br>
entering the vessel and, further, the vessel 30 has at least one agitator 36 therein, to<br>
agitate the alkyllithium and solvent to insure homogeneity of the solution. Blended<br>
alkyllithium is released from the vessel 30 through a blended alkyllithium outlet 34<br>
which is selectively opened or closed by a valve 38.	<br>
Spectroscopic measurements of the contents of the vessel 30 are made with an<br>
insertion probe 42. Alternatively, spectroscopic measurements of the contents of the<br>
vessel 30 are made by feeding a sample outlet stream 44 from the vessel 30 to a<br>
spectroscopic cell 45 and then returning the stream 46 to the vessel 30. Whether the<br>
insertion probe 42 or the normal spectroscopic cell 45 are used, an optical signal is<br>
sent to the probe 42 or cell 45 from the manipulated light source of the spectrometer,<br>
and returned from the probe 42 or cell 45 to a spectrometer/analyzer array 26; which<br>
converts the optical signal into a electronic signal and converts the electronic signal<br>
into data used to calculate the concentration of alkyllithium within the vessel 30. The<br>
calculated data is sent to a control unit 28, which adjusts the alkyllithium control<br>
valve 16, the solvent control valve 11, or both the alkyllithium and solvent valves<br>
16,11 in response to the difference in measured values of alkyllithium concentration<br>
and the desired concentration of alkyllithium.<br>
As with the in-line dilution system, the stirred tank system optionally employs<br>
additional spectroscopic cells located in line with the alkyllithium feed and/or the<br>
solvent feed. An alkyllithium feed spectroscopic cell 22 is optionally positioned<br>
either upstream or downstream of the alkyllithium flow control valve 16. Similarly, a<br>
solvent spectroscopic cell 20 is optionally positioned either upstream or downstream<br>
of the solvent flow control valve 11. These cells 20, 22 function in the same manner<br><br>
as the main spectroscopic cell 12, but may be used to provide additional information<br>
to the analyzer array 26 concerning the content of the feed streams.<br>
The components of the system may be formed from any material that is not<br>
reactive with alkyllithium compounds, and the components of the system are<br>
preferably formed of stainless steel.<br>
All measurements, calculations, and process settings of the system may be<br>
displayed to the user via a user interface. This information may also be transmitted to<br>
a remote location via such communication means as hardwiring, telephone, radio<br>
communication, or computer networks, including the Internet. The control logic of<br>
the system is optionally adjustable from a remote location via the same<br>
communication means discussed above.<br>
The system is advantageously constructed on a movable skid. The skid allows<br>
the system to be mobile and allows the temporary installation of the system where<br>
dilution of alkyllithium or a constant concentration of alkyllithium is required or<br>
desirable. Each of the alkyllithium inlet 15, the solvent inlet 10, and the blended butyl<br>
lithium outlet 24 are optionally connected to easily detachable fittings.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 5, a system 100 according to the present invention that<br>
can be attached to an ISO tanker is illustrated therein. As illustrated in FIG. 5, the<br>
system 100 can be attached to an ISO tanker 102, but can also be connected to another<br>
movable or stationary source of organometallic compound. In some embodiments,<br>
the ISO tanker 102 will supply the organometallic compound (such as butyl lithium)<br>
and the other components of the system will be provided on site (e.g., they may be<br>
permanent supply sources at a plant or factory). The system 100 includes three<br>
separate supply sources: the ISO tanker 102 for the organometallic compound; a<br>
nitrogen source 103; and a solvent source 107. These feed, respectively, into a<br>
nitrogen supply line 104, a solvent supply line 108, and an organometallic supply line<br>
130. These are described in greater detail below.<br>
The nitrogen supply line 104 is configured to supply nitrogen gas (or some<br>
other purge gas) to the system 100. The nitrogen supply line 104 includes an isolation<br>
valve 105 that can cut off the supply of nitrogen to the system 100 and a control valve<br>
106 that can control the flow rate of nitrogen into the system 100. In ordinary<br>
operation, the isolation valve 105 is closed to prevent the passage of nitrogen into the<br>
system 100. During maintenance of the system 100, the isolation valve 105 can be<br><br>
open to permit the passage of purging nitrogen into the system 100 or to<br>
conduct a pressure test on the system 100 before use.<br>
The solvent supply line 108 includes an isolation valve 109 that can cut off the<br>
supply of solvent to the system 100. The solvent supply line 108 meets the<br>
nitrogen supply line 104 at a junction 110. A flow control valve 116 and a flow<br>
transmitter 118 that can detect the flow rate of solvent in the solvent supply line<br>
108 are included in the solvent supply line 108 downstream of the junction 110.<br>
A spectroscopic cell subsystem 120 is connected with the solvent supply line<br>
downstream of the flow transmitter 118. The subsystem 120 includes an inlet<br>
line 122 that lead away from the solvent supply line 108 and an outlet line 126<br>
that returns to the solvent supply line 108. A spectroscopic cell 124 (for example,<br>
of the configuration described above in connection with FIGS. 1 and 2) spans the<br>
ends of the inlet and outlet lines 122, 126. A low flow switch 128 is located on<br>
the outlet line 126.<br>
The solvent supply line 108 also includes a valve 121 between the inlet and<br>
outlet lines 122, 126. Another control valve 129 is positioned downstream of the<br>
subsystem 120. The solvent supply line 108 terminates at a junction 141 with the<br>
organometallic supply line 130.<br>
Still referring to FIG. 5, the organometallic supply line 130 includes an isolation<br>
valve 132 that can be closed to isolate the organometallic supply source 102<br>
from the line 130. A maintenance line 134 extends between the organometallic<br>
supply line 130 and the solvent supply line 108 to provide flexibility in<br><br>
maintaining and flushing the system 100; the maintenance line 134 includes two<br>
valves 135a, 135b that sandwich a control valve 135c. A flow control valve 136 is<br>
located downstream of the maintenance line 134, as are a flow transmitter 138<br>
and a control valve 140. The organometallic supply line terminates at the<br>
aforementioned junction 141 with the solvent supply line 108.<br>
Referring once again to FIG. 5, a blended product line 142 begins at the junction<br>
141 and terminates at an exit 161. A static mixer 143 is positioned downstream<br>
of the junction 141 and serves to mix the streams exiting the solvent supply line<br>
108 and the organometallic supply line 130 A spectroscopic cell subsystem 146 is<br>
positioned downstream of the mixer 143. Like the subsystem 120 described<br>
above, the subsystem 146 includes inlet and outlet lines 150, 156, a<br>
spectroscopic cell 152, and a low flow switch 154. The inlet and outlet lines 150,<br>
156<br><br>
sandwich a valve 154 on the blended product line 142. A flow transmitter 158<br>
and a pressure transmitter 160 are positioned between the outlet line 156 and<br>
the exit 161.<br>
A flush line 162 extends between the blended product line 144 and the ISO<br>
tanker 100. A valve 163 and a control valve 164 are included in the flush line<br>
162.<br>
Referring still again to FIG. 5, a control system 165 includes a networker 166 and<br>
a PLC 172. The networker 166 is electrically connected with the spectroscopic<br>
cells 124, 152 by, respectively, fiber optic lines 167, 168. A signal line 170<br>
electrically connects the networker 166 with the PLC 172. A solvent control line<br>
176 electrically connects the PLC 172 and the flow control valve 116 found on<br>
the solvent supply line 108. Similarly, an organometallic control line electrically<br>
connects the PLC 172 and the flow control valve 136 found on the organometallic<br>
supply line 130. In some embodiments, the PLC 172 is connected to some or all<br>
of the valves, meters and indicators described above and can control their<br>
operation automatically (for example, through a pneumatic system) or though<br>
operator input.<br>
In operation, a blended organometallic solution of a desired concentration is<br>
produced by opening the valves 109, 116, 121 and 129 on the solvent supply<br>
line 108 and the valves 132, 136 and 140 on the organometallic supply line 130<br>
and closing the valve 105 on the nitrogen supply line 104. Solvent flows through<br>
the solvent supply line 108 to the junction 142 and into the mixer 143 (notably,<br>
solvent concentration is monitored by the spectroscopic cell 124). Organometallic<br><br>
material flows through the organometallic supply line 130 to the junction 142<br>
and into the mixer 143. Blended product then flows through the blended product<br>
supply line 144 to the exit 161. Some of the blended product is diverted into the<br>
spectroscopic cell subsystem 146, wherein the concentration of organometallic<br>
material in solution is detected.<br>
Optical signals indicative of the solution concentration from the spectroscopic<br>
cells 124, 152 is transmitted to the networker 166 via the fiber optic lines 167,<br>
168. Signals are then transmitted to the PLC 172 via the signal line 170. Based<br>
on the concentration information gathered and the predetermined desired<br>
concentration of solution, the PLC 172 may adjust the flow control valves 116,<br>
136 as needed by transmitting signals along the organometallic and solvent<br>
control lines 174, 176.<br>
The system 100 also includes additional features. For example, the system 100<br>
can automatically flush and acquire new reference spectra of the spectroscopic<br>
cells 124, 152 prior to use. Upon initialization of a blend process, the PLC 172<br>
can automatically open the solvent supply valves 109,116 and 129 (closing valve<br>
121)<br><br>
and flush the spectroscopic cells 124, 152 with solvent. The solvent can be directed<br>
back to the ISO tanker 102 or other vessel by opening the valve 164 in the flush line<br>
162. The PLC 172 can then close off the solvent supply line 108 by closing the valve<br>
109 and opening the valve 105 on the nitrogen supply line 104. This enables the<br>
system 100 to purge the spectroscopic cells 124, 152 using the inert gas supply, again<br>
back to the ISO tanker 102 or an appropriate waste vessel. The PLC 172 can then<br>
initialize the networker 166 to collect reference spectra on the spectroscopic cells 124,<br>
152 in turn. Upon each background collection the system 100 can carry out<br>
diagnostic checks on the health of the cells 124, 152. If a problem is identified the<br>
system 100 can automatically shut down and indicate maintenance is required. Once<br>
the background has been successfully obtained the system 100 can begin the desired<br>
blending operation. The automatic flush and background collection is designed to<br>
ensure no fouling of the system 100 occurs by process material and can ensure that<br>
the system 100 operates at peak performance.	<br>
Of course, the system 100 can be flushed in the manner described above at any<br>
point of operation; flushing is not limited to occurring prior to blending or to<br>
following the steps set forth above.<br>
The system 100 can be configured to be used in a single, permanent location<br>
or to be attached to an ISO tanker (as shown) and used as an off-loading blending<br>
device. In either instance the system 100 can be mounted on a skid and can contain a<br>
varying number of the components that make up the system 100, dependant on the<br>
requirements of the user's process. A skid-mounted system 100 can contain the<br>
control hardware such as valves, flow measurement devices as well as the PLC 172<br>
and the spectroscopic cell subsystems 120, 156. Alternatively, one or more of the<br>
spectroscopic cells can be located separate from the skid and communication between<br>
the cells and the skid is facilitated by the use of fiber optic and data cables.<br>
When the system 100 is configured as a stand-alone system, process<br>
connections to the skid would typically comprise the organometallic source, solvent,<br>
electrical power, instrument compressed air, inert gas, and spectroscopic fiber optic<br>
and data cables. If the skid is connected to the ISO tanker 102, the organometallic<br>
supply originates from the ISO tanker 102. The PLC 172 in this configuration<br>
typically has the ability to control pressurization and venting as well as monitoring<br>
temperature, pressure and level in the ISO tanker 102. It can also allow for washing<br>
of the system's internal pipe work and optics. The washings can be returned to the<br><br>
ISO tanker 102 by means of the flush line 162, which is directed back to an inlet on<br>
the ISO tanker 102.<br>
Those skilled in this art will appreciate that the system 100 can be used with<br>
continuous supply, batch, and semi-continuous supply systems.<br>
Although the spectrometers of the invention are used primarily for quantitative<br>
analysis of the alkyllithium and solvent samples, the spectrometers may be used to<br>
obtain qualitative data as well. Qualitative analysis of the samples is preferably<br>
utilized to detect impurities within the system. For instance, the spectrometer and<br>
analyzer are easily programmed to recognize the solvent being used. If a foreign<br>
solvent were inadvertently added to the system, an alarm could be sounded. Also, the<br>
spectrometer is easily programmed to recognize water within the solvent stream.<br>
Information about the solvent stream may be obtained prior to the mixing of the<br>
solvent stream and the alkyllithium stream. If the water content of the stream is above<br>
acceptable levels, an alert may be sounded or the control system of the apparatus may<br>
simply be triggered not to allow the mixing of the contaminated solvent with the<br>
alkyllithium. Content of above 1000 ppm water within the solvent stream is<br>
considered dangerous. Content of less than about 100 ppm is preferred, and content<br>
of less than 50 ppm is typical and most preferred.<br>
In accordance with the invention, a stream of alkyllithium solution having a<br>
consistent concentration may be produced from alkyllithium and solvent streams<br>
having varying or unknown concentrations. Further, by adjusting the control unit of<br>
the system output of user chosen concentrations of alkyllithium may be supplied from<br>
an alkyllithium storage container or from an alkyllithium production stream having a<br>
concentration higher than that desired by the end user.<br>
In accordance with the practices of this invention, delivery concentrations of<br>
alkyllithium solution produced with the in-line system are within 0.5% of the desired<br>
concentration. Continuous blending of the alkyllithium within a vessel may be<br>
controlled within 1.0% of the desired batch concentration.<br>
Many modifications and other embodiments of the invention will come to<br>
mind to one skilled in the art to which this invention pertains having the benefit of the<br>
teachings presented in the foregoing descriptions and the associated drawings.<br>
Therefore, it is to be understood that the invention is not to be limited to the specific<br>
embodiments disclosed and that modifications and other embodiments are intended to<br>
be included within the scope of the appended claims. Although specific terms are<br><br>
employed herein, they are used in a generic and descriptive sense only and not for<br>
purposes of limitation.<br><br>
