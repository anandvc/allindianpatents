TOPICAL COMPOSITIONS COMPRISING ASCOMYCINS<br>
PharroaGOUtioal Compositions<br>
This invention relates to topical compositions containing ascomycins for treatment of skin disorders, e.g. subacute and chronic inflammatory and hyperproliferative skin diseases, e.g. atopic dermatitis, vitiligo, psoriasis, lichenified skin diseases, e.g. lichen planus, a lichenified form of atopic dermatitis.<br>
Ascomycins have a variety of useful pharmacological actions, e.g. immunosuppression, and which may be administered topically. However, inter alia because of their physicochemical properties, e.g. high molecular weight and lipophilicity the ascomycins have posed problems for topical administration.<br>
Skin disorders also present difficulties in treatment, particularly lichenified skin diseases, e.g. psoriasis, where the skin is hyperproliferated and the skin barrier function and skin lipid composition may have changed. Topical compositions for use in lichenified skin diseases, e.g. psoriasis, containing an ascomycin present particular difficulties.<br>
After exhaustive testing it has now been surprisingly found that the compositions of the present invention serve to enhance penetration of active agent through human skin, e.g. for the treatment of lichenified skin diseases, e.g. psoriasis. These compositions show other particularly interesting properties, e.g. they are easily applied to large areas of the skin and are stable.<br>
In one aspect this invention provides a composition for topical administration of an ascomycin which composition comprises a carrier vehicle comprising (i)     means to retain water in the outer skin layer, and (ii)    means to hinder water evaporating from the skin.<br>
The ascomycin is hereafter referred to as active agent. Under "ascomycin" is to be understood ascomycin itself or a derivative, antagonist, agonist or analogue thereof, e.g. a compound of the FK 506 class.<br>
FK506 is a known macrolide antibiotic that is produced by Streotomvces tsukubaensis No 9993. It is also a potent immunosuppressant. The structure of FK506 is given in the<br><br>
appendix to the Merck Index, 11th Edition as item A5, Methods of preparing FK506 are described in EP 184162.<br>
Under "compound of the FK 506 class" is to be understood FK 506 itself or a derivative, antagonist, agonist or analogue thereof, which retain the basic structure and modulate at least one of the biological properties (for example immunological properties) of FK506. A large number of compounds of the FK 506 class are known. These compounds are described in for example EP 184162, EP 315978, EP 323042, EP 423714, EP 427680, EP 465426, EP 474126, WO 91/13889, WO 91/19495, EP 484936, EP 532088, EP 532089, EP 569337, EP 626385, WO 93/5059 and the like.<br>
It is also known (for example from EP 315978 and EP 474126) that ascomycin derivatives such as macrolactam compounds of the FK506 class are particularly useful in the topical treatment of inflammatory and hyperproliferative skin diseases and of cutaneous manifestations of immunologically-mediated illnesses.<br>
Thus examples of ascomycin derivatives suitable for use in the present invention include FK506; 33-epi-chloro-33-desoxy-ascomycin as disclosed in Example 66a in EP 427 680 (hereafter referred to as Compound A);<br>

It is to be appreciated that emulsifiers may be complex mixtures containing side products or unreacted starting products involved in the preparation thereof, e.g. emulsifiers made by polyoxyethylation may contain another side product, e.g. polyethylene glycol.<br>
Compositions additionally comprising emulsifiers may be particularly suitable if it is desirable to easily wash them off the skin.<br>
The compositions of the invention may further include, e.g. perfumes and/or coloring agents, as appropriate.<br>
The compositions according to the invention are useful in the treatment of subacute and chronic inflammatory and hyperproliferative skin diseases and of cutaneous manifestations of immunologically-mediated diseases. Examples of such diseases are psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis and further eczematous dermatitises, seborrhoic dermatitis, Lichen planus, a lichenified form of atopic dermatitis, vitiligo, Pemphigus, bullous<br><br>
Pemphigoid, Epidermolysis bullosa, urticaria, angioedemas, vasculitides, erythemas, cutaneous eosinophils, Lupus erythematous and Alopecia areata.<br>
In another aspect the present invention provides a composition as defined above for use in the treatment of inflammatory and hyperproliferative skin diseases and of cutaneous manifestations of immunologically-mediated diseases.<br>
In another aspect the present invention provides a method for treating inflammatory and hyperproliferative skin diseases and of cutaneous manifestations of immunologically-mediated diseases comprising administering a composition as defined above to the skin of a patient in need thereof.<br>
In another aspect the present invention provides the use of a composition as defined above in the preparation of a medicament for administering to the skin of a patient in need thereof.<br>
In yet another aspect the present invention provides the use of a composition as defined above in the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of inflammatory and hyperproliferative skin diseases and of cutaneous manifestations of immunologically-mediated diseases.<br>
In yet another aspect the present invention provides the use of a carrier vehicle as defined above to enhance penetration of an ascomycin through human skin.<br>
The carrier vehicle may be in the form of an ointment.<br>
The compositions of the invention may be prepared in a conventional manner by working up the components into a pharmaceutical composition.<br>
For example, the composition of the invention may be obtained by suspending the ascomycin and the urea in a mixture of liquid hydrocarbons and the lipophilic or polar solvent. Solid hydrocarbons may be mixed into the suspension in conventional manner. Alternatively, the composition of the invention may be obtained by suspending the ascomycin and the urea in a mixture of liquid hydrocarbons, solid hydrocarbons and the solvent as conventional. Other, e.g conventional, excipients may be added at the appropriate time.<br><br>
The utility of the compositions according to the invention can be observed in standard clinical tests such as the test set out below.<br>
A representative clinical trial is carried out as follows:<br>
	A randomised double-blind, vehicle-controlled within-patient study comparing a composition<br>
of the invention at a dose of 0.1 to 2 % by weight (based on the total weight of the<br>
composition) active agent over e.g. 10 cm2, corresponding to a dose of about 0.1 to 1<br>
mg/cm2, and if desired 0.005% calcipotriol ointment and/or 0.05% clobetasol-17-propionate<br>
ointment as positive control is performed in patients with chronic plaque type psoriasis.<br>
	In total 16 to 26 patients are treated with the composition twice daily for three weeks. The<br>
therapeutic effect on erythema, induration and scaling is evaluated for each of three clinical<br>
signs. In addition, the time to partial clearance is used for efficacy. Local tolerability of study<br>
medications and routine safety parameters, including haematology and clinical chemistry,<br>
are recorded.<br>
The compositions of the invention are found to be effective without occlusion by technical means, e.g. the Finn chamber technique, e.g. under open application conditions.<br>
The exact amount of the ascomycin and of the composition to be administered depends on several factors, for example the desired duration of treatment and the rate of release of the ascomycin. Satisfactory results are obtained in larger mammals, e.g. humans, with the local application over the area to be treated of a 0.1 to 2 % by weight, preferably 1 % by weight, concentration of the ascomycin once or several times a day (for example 2 to 5 times a day). In general the compositions may be applied to areas of skin as small as 1 cm2 to as large as 1 m2. Suitable skin loadings of the ascomycins fall within the range of from 0.001 mg/cm2 to about 3 mg/cm2, e.g. of from 0,1 mg/cm2 to about 1 mg/cm2.<br>
In particular the utility of the compositions according to the invention can be observed in standard clinical tests such as the test set out in Example 1 infra using a concentration of 0.1 to 2 % by weight (based on the total weight of the composition) active agent. The formulation of Example 1 was found to be effective in psoriasis.<br>
The compositions of this invention are well tolerated on skin. Good skin penetration and permeation rates may be achieved using the compositions of the invention.<br><br>
The compositions of this invention have the advantage of few components, are straightforward to prepare and are well-tolerated on human skin.<br>
The following Examples illustrate the invention.<br>

An ointment is formed.<br>
In total 20 patients were treated for three weeks. The therapeutic effect on erythema, induration and scaling was evaluated for each of three clinical signs. In addition, the time to partial clearance was used for efficacy. Local tolerability of study medications and routine safety parameters, including haematology and clinical chemistry, were recorded.<br>
The formulation of Example 1 was effective. Local tolerability of the study medications tested was good and no systemic side effects were observed.<br><br>
