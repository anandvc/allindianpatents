				<td>Polyphosphate derivative of a 1,3,5-triazine compound, a process<br>
for the production thereof and use thereof<br>
WO 00/02869 discloses polyphosphate salts of 1,3,5-triazine<br>
compounds which have an average condensation coefficient (number<br>
average) of greater than 20 and a molar ratio of triazine compound such as<br>
melamine to phosphorus (M/P) &gt; 1.1. The WO-specification also describes<br>
a two-stage process for the production of those salts by conversion of a<br>
1,3,5-triazine compound with orthophosphoric acid into the corresponding<br>
orthophosphate salt as well as thermal treatment for conversion of the<br>
orthophosphate salt into a polyphosphate of the 1,3,5-triazine compound.<br>
In addition to the orthophosphates it is also possible to use<br>
pyrophosphates. The polyphosphate salts described in that publication are<br>
desirably to be used as flame-retardant agents.<br>
WO-specification WO 97/44377 describes a melamine<br>
polymetaphosphate of a solubility of 0.01 to 0.10 g/100 ml in water at<br>
25°C, a pH-value of 2.5 to 4.5, in the form of a 10% aqueous slurry at<br>
25°C and a melamine content of 1.0 to 1.1 mole per mole of phosphorus.<br>
That melamine polymetaphosphate is also obtained in a two-stage process<br>
in which in a first stage melamine, urea and an aqueous orthophosphoric<br>
acid solution are mixed together in such a ratio that the molar ratio of<br>
melamine to orthophosphoric acid is 1.0 to 1.5 and the molar ratio of urea<br>
to orthophosphoric acid is 0.1 to 1.5. The reaction is effected at a<br>
temperature of 0 to 140°C with the removal of water, a powder double salt<br>
of orthophosphoric acid, melamine and urea being obtained. In a second<br>
stage that is calcined at a temperature of 240 to 340°C and in that case<br>
affords melamine polymetaphosphates. That publication also refers to<br><br>
flame-retardant agents as the field of use for the melamine<br>
polymetaphosphates.<br>
WO 00/02869 refers to the disadvantage of the melamine<br>
polymetaphosphates in accordance with WO 97/44377 that the melamine<br>
polymetaphosphates produced in accordance with the process described<br>
therein are unsuitable for the use as flame-retardant agents in polymers, in<br>
particular in polyamides and polyesters which are typically processed at<br>
elevated temperatures. According to the information set out in WO<br>
00/02869 those melamine polymetaphosphates have inadequate heat<br>
resistance, impact strength, tensile strength and breaking strength. There<br>
was therefore no reason for the man skilled in the art to find pointers in<br>
WO 97/44377 for example for improving the polyphosphate salts in<br>
accordance with WO 00/02869.<br>
European laid-open application No 1 386 942 discloses flame-<br>
retardant agents which include a phosphinate or diphosphinate together<br>
with a 1,3,5-triazine compound, which are intended to improve the effect<br>
over the individual substances.<br>
When using polyphosphate salts in accordance with WO 00/02869 as<br>
flame-retardant agents in plastic materials, in particular in glass fibre-<br>
reinforced polyamides, polyesters, such as polyethylene terephthalate and<br>
polybutylene terephthalate which are usually processed at relatively high<br>
temperatures (more specifically above 320°C), premature partial<br>
decomposition was also noted, which on the one hand lead to an attack by<br>
the decomposition products on the moulding tools used and which later<br>
when used for example as electrical insulating lacquers on copper wires<br>
lead to an attack on the latter.<br>
The object of the invention was therefore that of further improving<br>
the polyphosphate salts of 1,3,5-triazine compounds, which are known<br>
from WO 00/02869, so that they are heat-resistant even at processing<br>
temperatures above 320°C and for that purpose have a low level of water<br>
solubility and a low level of conductivity. Surprisingly that object was<br>
attained by the present invention, in respect of which information on page<br>
2 and page 11 of WO 00/02869 is in part in conflict. The polyphosphate<br><br>
derivatives according to the invention of a 1,3,5-triazine compound, in<br>
particular melamine polyphosphate, with an average condensation<br>
coefficient n (number average) &gt; 20 and a pH-value of a 10% aqueous<br>
slurry of the polyphosphate derivative at 25°C of 5 or higher are<br>
characterised in that they have a molar ratio of 1,3,5-triazine compound to<br>
phosphorus, M/P  320°C.<br>
Those polyphosphate derivatives can be used as flame-retardant<br>
agents in any plastic materials, preferably thermoplastic materials and<br>
thermosetting materials, in particular also in glass fibre-reinforced<br>
polyamides and polyesters which are processed at high temperatures. In<br>
consideration of the information in WO 00/02869 on pages 1 and 2 as well<br>
as page 11, lines 15 - 20, that result was not to be expected but rather the<br>
man skilled in the art had to reckon on the fact that, with a M/P 
pH-value of the melamine polyphosphate above 5 can be obtained and that<br>
the phosphate derivatives with such a low M/P are not suitable as a flame-<br>
retardant agent for plastic materials such as glass fibre-reinforced<br>
polyamides and polyesters, because of the excessively low level of heat<br>
resistance.<br>
Because of the surprising heat resistance of the polyphosphate<br>
derivatives according to the invention, there are no longer any limitations<br>
in terms of the use of melamine polyphosphates and corresponding triazine<br>
derivatives as flame-retardant agents in plastic materials, in particular<br>
thermoplastic materials. The series of plastic materials into which the<br>
polyphosphate derivatives according to the invention can be incorporated<br>
are to be found on pages 6 and 7 of WO 00/02869, and for that reason the<br>
content of those pages is hereby made the subject-matter of the present<br>
application.<br>
The polyphosphates of the invention can be reproduced in simplified<br>
form by the following general formula:<br><br><br>
wherein M denotes a 1,3,5-triazine compound and n denotes the average<br>
condensation coefficient. For high and medium condensation coefficients<br>
n the sum formula can be reduced to (MHP03)n. Therein M once again<br>
denotes the 1,3,5-triazine compound and n denotes the average<br>
condensation coefficient.<br>
1,3,5-Triazine compounds which fall to be considered are for<br>
example 2,4,6-triamine-l,3,5-triazine (melamine) and its derivatives,<br>
condensation products such as melam, melem, melon, ammeline and<br>
ammelide but also 2-ureidomelamine, acetoguanamine, benzoguanamine<br>
and diaminophenyltriazine. It will be appreciated that it is also possible to<br>
use mixtures of those 1,3,5-triazine compounds. Melamine, its derivatives<br>
and condensation products are preferred in the present invention, in<br>
particular melamine.<br>
The average condensation coefficient n of the phosphates can be<br>
ascertained in accordance with known methods such as for example by<br>
means of NMR, J. Am. Chein. Soc. 78, 5715 (1956). The average<br>
condensation coefficient n is preferably at least 30, still more preferably in<br>
the range of 40 to 150. That average condensation coefficient can also be<br>
referred to as the average chain length of the phosphate derivative.<br>
The polyphosphate derivatives according to the invention have an<br>
enhanced heat resistance at 320° to 370°C. That is determined by the<br>
temperature at which the weight loss is 2%. The low M/P-ratio results in a<br>
higher P content and thus a process effect which is 15% better and an<br>
extremely low level of water solubility, which is of very great significance in<br>
terms of plastic products, in particular in the outdoor region. The water<br>
solubility of the polyphosphate derivatives according to the invention is<br>
preferably below 0.1 g/100 ml and still more preferably below 0.01 g/100<br><br>
ml. With those orders of magnitude it is possible to refer to a product which<br>
is virtually insoluble in water.<br>
As mentioned the molar ratio M/P is preferably below 1.0 and still<br>
more preferably between 0.8 and 1.0.<br>
The pH-value is determined in a 10% aqueous slurry of the<br>
polyphosphate derivative according to the invention, by a procedure<br>
whereby 25g of the polyphosphate derivative and 225g of pure water are<br>
stirred at 25°C in a vessel and the pH-value of the resulting aqueous<br>
suspension is determined with conventional means. Preferred pH-values<br>
are approximately in the range of 5.1 to 6.9.<br>
Preferably the polyphosphate derivatives according to the invention<br>
have a decomposition temperature above 360, particularly above 380 and<br>
in particular above 400°C.<br>
A process according to the invention for the production of the<br>
polyphosphate derivatives set forth in claims 1 to 6 provides that an<br>
orthophosphate and/or at least one condensed phosphate of a 1,3,5-<br>
triazine compound, preferably melamine, with an average condensation<br>
coefficient n of below 20, is heat-treated in an ammonia atmosphere at a<br>
temperature in the range of 300 to 400°C, preferably in the range of 340 to<br>
380°C, particularly preferably in the range of 370 to 380°C, and in that<br>
case a condensation product with an average condensation coefficient n<br>
(number average) &gt; 20 is obtained.<br>
Usually the starting material involved is the melamine<br>
orthophosphate but that can be supplemented or replaced by condensed<br>
phosphates such as for example pyrophosphates and less condensed<br>
polyphosphates. The heat treatment must be effected for different periods<br>
of time at different temperatures depending on the respective starting<br>
phosphate used so that at any event the average condensation coefficient<br>
is above 20. The concentration of the ammonia in the gas atmosphere of<br>
the heat-treatment zone is desirably in the range of 0.1 to 100% by mass,<br>
preferably in the range of 1 to 30%, particularly in the range of 2 to 10%,<br>
in particular 3 to 5%. It is particularly desirable for the starting material<br>
used to be a 1,3,5-triazine compound, preferably a melamine compound,<br><br>
with a particle size which is as fine as possible, desirably an average<br>
particle size≤15 urn, preferably≤10 urn. With a coarser particle size<br>
grinding of the starting products is desirably effected prior to the heat<br>
treatment in order to produce the specified average particle sizes ≤ 15 µm,<br>
preferably ≤ 10 µrn.<br>
The flame-retardant properties of the polyphosphate derivatives<br>
according to the invention of a 1,3,5-triazine compound can be further<br>
increased if the polyphosphate derivatives are combined with at least one<br>
phosphinate and/or diphosphinate.<br>
Preferably the phosphinates or diphosphinates are of the following<br>
formulae I and II respectively:<br><br>
wherein<br>
R\ R2 are the same or different and CrCg-alkyl, straight or branched, C1-<br>
C7-hydroxyalkyl, straight or branched, or aryl,<br>
R3	is C1-C10-alkyls, straight or branched, C6-C10-aryls, alkylaryls or<br>
arylalkyls,<br>
M	is Mg, Ca, Al, Sb, Sn, Ge, Ti, Zn, Fe, Zr, Ce, Bi, Sr, Mn, Li, Na, K<br>
and/or a protonised nitrogen base, preferably Ca, Mg, Al and Zn,<br>
m	is 1 to 4,<br>
n	is 1 to 4, and<br><br>
x	is 1 - 4.<br>
Particularly preferably M is the same as Al. Desirably the flame-<br>
retardant mixtures contain so much of the polyphosphate derivative (A)<br>
according to the invention and the diphosphinate (B) that A:B = 3:7 to 7:3,<br>
preferably 3:4 to 4:3.<br>
The flame-retardant properties of the polyphosphate derivatives<br>
according to the invention of a 1,3,5-triazine compound can be quite<br>
particularly preferably also increased by the polyphosphate derivatives<br>
being mixed with aluminium phosphinates of the general formula (I):<br><br>
wherein<br>
R1	is -CH3, -CH2OH, -C2H5, -CH(OH)CH3 or -C(OH)(CH3)2,<br>
R2	is -CH2OH, -C2H4OH, -C3H6OH or -CH(OH)CH3,<br>
M	is Al, and<br>
m	1 to 4<br>
The aluminium phosphinate mixtures can be obtained by the free<br>
phosphinic acids being obtained in aqueous solution in known manner from<br>
alkali phosphinate mixtures and by their being reacted by subsequent<br>
boiling with aluminium hydroxide or aluminium oxyhydroxide slurries in<br>
water. It is found however that this neutralisation reaction takes up<br>
reaction times which are many times longer. It is therefore more<br>
appropriate for the alkali phosphinates obtained from the phosphorus<br>
reaction to be caused to react with the required amount of water-soluble<br>
aluminium salts such as for example chloride, hydroxychloride, sulphate,<br>
nitrate or formiate in aqueous solution, in which respect it may be<br>
necessary to completely dissolve the mixture by a small mineral acid<br>
addition and then to precipitate the aluminium phosphinate mixtures by<br>
raising the pH-value to 4 to 7. Subsequent heating of the aqueous<br>
suspension to temperatures between 105 and 150°C in pressure vessels<br><br>
facilitates later separation of the difficultly soluble precipitate. The<br>
aluminium phosphinate precipitate is then filtered, washed and dried.<br>
A further advantageous embodiment of the invention is characterised<br>
in that all or a part of the flame-retardant agents, that is to say the<br>
polyphosphinate derivative or derivatives and/or the phosphinate or<br>
phosphinates and/or diphosphinate or diphosphinates and/or the further<br>
included per se known flame-retardant agents, are coated with a silicon-<br>
bearing coating agent and/or modified in some other fashion. Such a<br>
modification is known for example from DE 198 30 128 Al, the content of<br>
which is hereby incorporated into the subject-matter of the present<br>
application by reference thereto. With the modification procedure an<br>
organofunctional silane or a mixture of organofunctional silanes or an<br>
oligomeric organosiloxane or a mixture of oligomeric organosiloxanes or a<br>
solvent-bearing preparation based on monomeric organosilanes and/or<br>
oligomeric organosiloxanes or a preparation based on water-soluble<br>
organopolysiloxanes are applied to a flame-retardant agent in powder form<br>
and the flame-retardant agent is kept in motion during the coating<br>
operation.<br>
Preferably 0.05 to 10% by weight of silicon-bearing coating agent<br>
with respect to the amount of flame-retardant agent is used. Desirably the<br>
coating agent is applied to the flame-retardant agent in the course of 10<br>
seconds to 2 hours at a temperature of 0 to 200°C. It is further<br>
advantageous if the flame-retardant agent which is coated with coating<br>
agent is subjected to a post-treatment under the effect of heat at a<br>
temperature of up to 200°C and/or under reduced pressure. The<br>
organofunctional silane used is advantageously an aminoalkyl- or<br>
epoxyalkyl- or acryloxyalkyl- or methacryloxyalkyl- or mercaptoalkyl- or<br>
alkenyl- or alkyl-functional alkoxysilane.<br>
A particular advantage of modifying the flame-retardant agent with<br>
silicon-bearing coating agent is that the flame-retardant agent is more<br>
resistant to environmental influences such as moisture. The modification<br>
provides that washing-out of the flame-retardant agent in the course of<br>
time is prevented or reduced.<br><br>
The invention is further described by reference to the following<br>
Examples.<br>
Example 1 and Comparative Example 1<br>
a.	876.96 kg of melamine was mixed in a blade mixer. 784 kg of<br>
75% phosphoric acid was brought into contact with the melamine by<br>
spraying, in which case the reaction took place. The melamine<br>
orthophosphate formed was finely ground in an ACM-mill.<br>
b.	The melamine orthophosphate was heat-treated in an oven.<br>
The oven temperature was set to 380°C before the melamine<br>
orthophosphate was introduced into the oven. The temperature and<br>
the ammonia concentration in the oven atmosphere were<br>
respectively set and kept approximately constant throughout the<br>
entire experiment. An ammonia atmosphere was created in the oven,<br>
with the ammonia concentration in the ammonia atmosphere being<br>
variable.<br>
In Example 1 in accordance with the invention a relatively high<br>
ammonia concentration, namely corresponding to -3 mm water column,<br>
was set. One result was that the pH-value was 5.524 and thus markedly<br>
above 5. At the same time the solubility at 0.032 g/100 ml was reduced to<br>
approximately a third in comparison with the subsequent Comparative<br>
Example. It was not possible to find any chemical attack on the moulding<br>
tools in the subsequent processing operation. The heat resistance of the<br>
product of Example 1 was about 373°C-TGA (2% weight loss), that is to<br>
say a weight loss of 2% was achieved at about 373°C.<br>
In Comparative Example 1 a lower ammonia concentration than in<br>
Example 1 was set by altering the level of ammonia concentration in the<br>
oven atmosphere. That corresponded to -100 mm water column. The effect<br>
was that the pH-value now abruptly fell and was about 3.57 in the<br>
suspension. The heat resistance was about 353°C-TGA (2% weight loss).<br>
The conditions and results of this experiment are set out in Table 1.<br><br><br><br>
In this case the heat resistance was practically the same in both<br>
tests, but the pH-value in Example 2 according to the invention is<br>
considerably higher than in the case of Comparative Example 2.<br><br>
