				<td>METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR ALLOCATING ACKCH RESOURCES IN<br>
A WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention generally relates to a resource allocation method and<br>
apparatus for a wireless communication system, and in particular, to a method and<br>
apparatus for allocating positive Acknowledgement (ACK)/Negative<br>
Acknowledgement (NACK) physical channel, referred to herein as ACKCH,<br>
resources with which a reception side notifies a transmission side of the<br>
success/failure in decoding of a received data channel.<br>
2. Description of the Related Art<br>
In wireless communication systems, the technology for controlling a<br>
transmission error during data transmission is generally classified into a Forward<br>
Error Correction (FEC) technique and an Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ)<br>
technique. The FEC technique attempts to correct an error detected from received<br>
data, and decodes correct data upon success in the error correction. However, when<br>
the FEC technique has failed in the error correction, wrong information may be<br>
provided to users or the information may be missing. The ARQ technique transmits<br>
data using an FEC code having a high error detection capability, and when an error is<br>
detected from received data, a reception side sends a request for data retransmission<br>
to a transmission side.<br>
The FEC technique has a relatively lower efficiency in a good channel<br>
environment, and reduces system reliability when the FEC technique fails in the<br>
error correction. On the contrary, the ARQ technique typically secures high system<br>
reliability and enables efficient transmission with a low redundancy, but the system<br>
reliability is considerably reduced in a poor channel environment due to the frequent<br>
retransmission request. In order to address such shortcomings, the two techniques<br>
have been appropriately combined to provide a Hybrid ARQ (HARQ) technique.<br>
The HARQ technique basically attempts error correction on received coded<br>
data, referred to herein as a HARQ packet, and determines whether to make a<br>
retransmission request for the HARQ packet using a simple error detection code,<br>
such as a Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) code. A reception side of a system<br>
using the HARQ technique determines presence/absence of an error in a received<br>
HARQ packet, and transmits an HARQ Positive Acknowledgement (ACK) signal or<br>
an HARQ Negative Acknowledgement (NACK) signal to a transmission side<br>
according to the presence/absence of an error. The transmission side performs<br>
retransmission of the HARQ packet or transmission of a new HARQ packet<br>
according to the HARQ ACK/NACK signal. Upon normal receipt of an HARQ<br>
packet, the reception side transmits the ACK/NACK signal using appropriate<br>
resources. Particularly, when the HARQ technique is used, a channel over which<br>
the ACK/NACK signal is transmitted is call a Physical Hybrid ARQ Indicator<br>
Channel (PHICH).<br>
An Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)-based wireless<br>
communication system transmits the ACK/NACK signal on several subcarriers, and<br>
a Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA) system transmits the<br>
ACK/NACK signal on a particular code channel. Generally, since packet data for<br>
several users is simultaneously transmitted in an arbitrary packet data transmission<br>
interval or Transmission Time Interval (TTI), ACKCHs for each of the HARQ<br>
packets are transmitted at particular times after the data received from the users<br>
which are scheduled data in the TTI is decoded.<br>
Transmission of the ACKCH will be considered below separately for the<br>
downlink and the uplink. Regarding ACKCH for downlink data channels, each<br>
terminal or User Equipment (UE) that has received each of the data channels from a<br>
base station is allocated physical channel resources for transmitting the ACK/NACK<br>
signal from the base station, and transmits the ACKCH on the uplink. Meanwhile,<br>
regarding ACKCH for uplink data channels, after a base station receives the data<br>
channels from corresponding UEs, the base station transmits ACKCH for each data<br>
packet over the resources agreed upon between the base station and each UE.<br>
FIG. 1 illustrates a conventional OFDM-based downlink frame structure of<br>
Enhanced Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (EUTRA) which is the next generation<br>
mobile communication standard of the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP).<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, a total of 50 Resource Blocks (RBs) 102 exist in a 10-MHz<br>
system bandwidth 101. One RB is composed of 12 subcarriers 103, and can have<br>
14 OFDM symbol intervals 104. In every OFDM symbol interval 104, a<br>
modulation symbol of a downlink channel is transmitted on each subcarrier 103.<br>
As shown above, one subcarrier band in one OFDM symbol interval is referred to as<br>
a Resource Element (RE) 106, and in FIG. 1, a total of 168 (=14 OFDM symbols x<br>
12 subcarriers) REs exist in one RB. In one OFDM symbol interval 104, one<br>
downlink data channel can be allocated to one or more RBs according to a data rate,<br>
and can be transmitted through the allocated RBs.<br>
With consideration of the downlink frame structure of FIG. 1, a maximum of<br>
50 downlink data channels can be simultaneously scheduled in one TTI 105. In this<br>
case, the uplink needs 50 ACKCHs. Generally, a group of multiple REs 106<br>
constitutes one ACKCH, and the overhead and performance occupied by the<br>
ACKCH in all resources of the system depends on how resources of the ACKCH are<br>
formed.<br>
Therefore, in order to improve the overhead and performance occupied by<br>
ACKCH in all resources of the system, a need exists for a scheme for efficiently<br>
allocating and forming resources of the ACKCH.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described in<br>
detail with reference to the annexed drawings. In the following description, a<br>
description of known functions and configurations incorporated herein has been<br>
omitted for clarity and conciseness. Terms used herein are based on functions in<br>
the present invention and may vary according to users, operators' intention or usual<br>
practices. Therefore, the definition of the terms should be made based on contents<br>
throughout the specification. In particular, Acknowledgement (ACK)/Negative<br>
Acknowledgement (NACK) physical channel (ACKCH) and Physical Hybrid ARQ<br>
Indicator Channel (PHICH) used throughout this disclosure each indicate a channel<br>
over which an ACK/NACK signal is transmitted.<br>
Although embodiments of the present invention will be described below<br>
mainly for an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)-based wireless<br>
communication system, especially for the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)<br>
Enhanced Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (EUTRA) standard, those skilled in the<br>
art should understand that the present invention can be applied to other<br>
communication systems having the similar technical background and channel format<br>
with a slight modification without departing from the spirit and scope of the<br>
invention.<br>
The present invention provides a method and apparatus for allocating<br>
resources for ACKCH in a wireless communication system. FIGS. 2A and 2B are<br>
diagrams illustrating an example where ACKCH resources have an implicit mapping<br>
relation with a data channel(s) or scheduling control channel(s). According to the<br>
present invention, as shown in FIGS. 2A and 2B, when ACKCH resource #1 201 has<br>
an implicit mapping relation with RB# 1 202 used for transmission of a data channel<br>
or when ACKCH resource #1 203 has an implicit mapping relation with downlink<br>
Control Channel Element (CCE) 204 where data transmitted over the data channel is<br>
scheduled, the ACKCH resources existing in several frequency domains in the<br>
system band are uniformly used without being concentrated on a particular frequency<br>
domain. Implicit mapping, as used herein, refers to pre-defined mapping, and<br>
indicates that a UE, when transmitting or receiving an ACK/NACK channel, can<br>
determine which resource the UE should use, through use of pre-defined mapping<br>
between ACK/NACK channel resource and data channel RB or pre-defined mapping<br>
between ACK/NACK channel resource and scheduling control channel, without the<br>
need to explicitly receive signaling information from a base station.<br>
In addition, the present invention maps an ACKCH to a physical resource to<br>
improve frequency diversity gain and inter-cell interference diversity gain.<br>
Further, the present invention uses the same Resource Block(s) (RB(s))<br>
during Multi-User Multi-Input Multi-Output (MU-MIMO) transmission so ACKCHs<br>
from MU-MIMO User Equipments (UEs) receiving transmission data can be<br>
transmitted to a base station without mutual interference. In particular, the present<br>
invention brings performance improvement of ACKCH and efficient utilization of<br>
resources when a technology is applied in which multiple ACKCHs are transmitted<br>
after being mapped to the same frequency resource using Code Division<br>
Multiplexing (CDM).<br>
An ACKCH resource allocation method and apparatus for a wireless<br>
communication system according to the present invention implicitly signals physical<br>
resources to be used for the ACKCH through use of a mapping relation preset<br>
between resources allocated to the data channel and resources allocated to the<br>
ACKCH, or between a downlink control channel where the data channel is scheduled<br>
and resources allocated to the ACKCH.<br>
Regarding physical resources, i.e., a set of Resource Elements (REs), to be<br>
used for transmission of each ACKCH, the base station can explicitly provide<br>
corresponding information to a UE, or can allow the set of REs to be used for<br>
ACKCH transmission to have an implicit mapping relation with an RB used for<br>
transmission of a downlink data channel or with downlink CCE where data resources<br>
are scheduled, as shown in FIGS. 2A and 2B.<br>
More specifically, referring to FIGS. 2A and 2B, the present invention maps<br>
physical resources to an ACKCH, when an implicit mapping rule is applied between<br>
an ACKCH and an RB of a data channel, or between an ACKCH and a downlink<br>
CCE. The core of the physical resource mapping method is to map ACKCHs being<br>
mapped to consecutive RBs or CCEs with consecutive indexes, to different<br>
frequency resources. The mapping process allows REs used for transmission of the<br>
ACKCHs to uniformly spread over the entire system band, so the ACKCH resource<br>
allocation method and apparatus according to the present invention can uniformly<br>
use frequency resources of ACKCHs and achieve good frequency diversity and inter-<br>
cell interference diversity in the system where consecutive RBs are allocated for one<br>
data channel, like a Single-Carrier Frequency Division Multiple Access (SC-FDMA)<br>
system.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 2A and 2B, when implicit mapping is used, the base<br>
station has no need to explicitly signal ACKCH resources to a UE, contributing to a<br>
considerable reduction in or removal of signaling overhead of ACKCH resources.<br>
Shown in FIG. 2A is an example where ACKCH resources are mapped to N RBs on a<br>
one-to-one basis. Each ACKCH resource 201 in FIG. 2A is one physical channel<br>
composed of several REs 106 in FIG. 1, and when transmission of several ACKCHs<br>
is permitted through the same REs 106, they are different ACKCH resources 201<br>
since they are different in CDM sequence used for distinguishing each ACKCH. If<br>
a UE transmits a data channel using RB#1 202, an ACKCH for the UE is transmitted<br>
from the base station using ACKCH resource #1 201 and the UE receives the<br>
corresponding ACKCH.<br>
Meanwhile, shown in FIG. 2B is an example where ACKCH resources are<br>
implicitly mapped to CCE 204 of a downlink control channel for transmitting<br>
scheduling information of the data channel. In the above, CCE 204 indicates a set<br>
of REs 106 constituting the downlink control channel. For example, a UE, which is<br>
scheduled (allocated) an uplink data channel from a control channel based on CCE# 1<br>
204, transmits an ACK/NACK signal using ACKCH resource #1 203 mapped to the<br>
CCE# 1 204. The downlink control channel can be composed of one or multiple<br>
CCEs according to the channel state of the UE receiving the control channel, and the<br>
amount of information transmitted over the control channel.<br>
A description will now be made of an ACKCH resource mapping and<br>
signaling technology according to the present invention.<br>
FIG. 3 is a diagram illustrating an ACKCH resource allocation method<br>
according to a first embodiment of the present invention. In the first embodiment<br>
of the present invention, RBs 302 are allocated during data channel transmission in<br>
the uplink, REs 301 are used for ACKCH transmission for the uplink data channel in<br>
the downlink, and the remaining downlink REs are not shown for convenience.<br>
Meanwhile, shown in FIGS. 5A and 5B is an example where REs 501, 502<br>
and 503 used for transmission of ACKCH and REs 504, 505 and 506 used for<br>
transmission of the remaining channels such as Physical Downlink Control Channel<br>
(PDCCH) and Physical Downlink Shared Channel (PDSCH) are illustrated together.<br>
FIGS. 5A and 5B are diagrams illustrating the situation in which downlink channels<br>
are mapped to REs separately for each cell. REs denoted by reference numeral 306<br>
and 309 in FIG. 3 correspond to REs denoted by reference numeral 501 in FIGS. 5A<br>
and 5B; REs denoted by reference numeral 307 and 310 in FIG. 3 correspond to REs<br>
denoted by reference numeral 502 in FIGS. 5A and 5B; and REs denoted by<br>
reference numeral 308 and 311 in FIG. 3 correspond to REs denoted by reference<br>
numeral 503 in FIGS. 5A and 5B.<br>
In FIG. 3, since the horizontal axis 312 represents frequency, the REs spaced<br>
farther from each other are significantly different in frequency on the downlink<br>
transmission band. As shown in FIG. 3, REs denoted by reference numeral 306 and<br>
REs denoted by reference numeral 311 are located in the opposite sides on the<br>
transmission band. Although a description of the first embodiment is given herein<br>
as to downlink ACKCH for an uplink data channel, the same can be applied even to<br>
uplink ACKCH for a downlink data channel.<br>
According to a mapping rule between uplink RB 302 and downlink ACKCH<br>
301 shown in FIG. 3, since downlink ACKCH for uplink data channel transmitted<br>
using RB#1 is mapped to REs 306 and 309 (see 303), a base station transmits an<br>
ACK/NACK signal using the REs 306 and 309 after receiving the data channel from<br>
a UE, and the UE receives ACK/NACK signal from the REs through use of a<br>
particular mapping rule 303. Similarly, downlink ACKCH for the uplink data<br>
channel transmitted using RB#2 is transmitted using REs 307 and 310. The REs<br>
306 and 309, and the REs 307 and 310 preferably have bands spaced apart to some<br>
extent in order to obtain frequency diversity gain.<br>
The present invention is more advantageous to a case where more than two<br>
consecutive RBs are allocated for data channel transmission. Particularly, in the<br>
EUTRA uplink, since the SC-FDMA transmission scheme is used, consecutive RBs<br>
are usually allocated in order to satisfy the single-carrier transmission characteristic<br>
when more than two RBs are allocated for data channel transmission. For example,<br>
in FIG. 3, if RB#2 and RB#3 are allocated for transmission of a certain data channel<br>
and a UE transmits the data channel using the RBs, a base station can use REs 307,<br>
308, 310 and 311 for ACKCH transmission by means of mapping rules 304 and 305.<br>
In this case, if the base station receiving the data channel transmits ACKCH using all<br>
the REs 307, 308, 310 and 311, an ACK/NACK signal is distributed over four RE<br>
groups 307, 308, 310 and 311 during transmission of the ACK/NACK signal,<br>
making it possible to improve frequency diversity and inter-cell interference<br>
diversity gains as several ACKCH frequency resources are uniformly used as<br>
compared with the case where only the RE groups 307 and 310, or 308 and 311<br>
mapped to one RB are used.<br>
If several ACKCH frequency resources are uniformly used in this way,<br>
performance reduction caused by the mutual interference between ACKCHs<br>
multiplexed to the concentrated frequency resources as ACKCH transmission is<br>
concentrated only on particular frequency resources can be prevented. Meanwhile,<br>
in this first embodiment, one RE group is composed of four adjacent REs, and the<br>
present invention is not limited to an RE group having a specific size and can be<br>
applied regardless of the number of REs belonging to the RE group.<br>
According to the mapping method shown in FIG. 3, when a data channel is<br>
transmitted using three arbitrary consecutive RBs, ACKCH can be transmitted using<br>
all of six RE groups 306~311. For example, when RB#3, RB#4 and RB#5 are used<br>
for data channel transmission, all of ACKCH resources 315, 316 and 317 mapped to<br>
the three RBs are used, so the ACKCH is distributed over six RE groups 306~311<br>
during transmission of the ACKCH. In this case, in each RE group, sequences<br>
allocated to the ACKCH resources 315, 316 and 317 are used.<br>
In addition, four ACKCH resources 313, 316, 319 and 320 exist in the RE<br>
group 309 in order to transmit ACKCH mapped to RB#1, RB#4, RB#7 and RB#10,<br>
and the four ACKCH resources 313, 316, 319 and 320 are transmitted over the same<br>
frequency resources. The four ACKCH resources 313, 316, 319 and 320, as shown<br>
in FIG. 4, are allocated sequences having mutual orthogonality or quasi-<br>
orthogonality separately for each ACKCH resource so they can be distinguished in<br>
the code domain.<br>
FIG. 4 is a diagram illustrating a process of mapping multiple ACKCHs to<br>
the same RE group according to the first embodiment of the present invention. For<br>
example, if an ACK/NACK signal to be transmitted is defined as 'b' when a<br>
ACKCH mapped to a data channel transmitted on RB#1 is transmitted, s11xb, s12xb,<br>
s13xb and s14xb are formed in the RE group 309 by multiplying the ACK/NACK<br>
signal b by sequences 402 of s11, sl2, s13 and s14, respectively, and transmitted<br>
over RE#1, RE#2, RE#3 and RE#4, respectively. In the above process, the<br>
sequences 402 of si 1, s12, s13 and sl4 can be made by multiplying orthogonal<br>
sequences such as length-4 Walsh or DFT sequences by cell-specific random<br>
sequences. Since sequences having a long length are generally applied for the cell-<br>
specific random sequences, every RE group has a different sequence value.<br>
Regarding ACKCH corresponding to a data channel transmitted on RB#7, an<br>
ACK/NACK signal to be transmitted on the RE group 309 are multiplied by<br>
sequences 404 of s31, s32, s33 and s34, and transmitted on RE#1, RE#2, RE#3 and<br>
RE#4, respectively. Therefore, according to this first embodiment, ACKCHs being<br>
mapped to RBs RB#1, RB#4, RB#7 and RB#10 spaced apart from each other can be<br>
transmitted by applying different sequences to the same frequency resource, i.e., by<br>
applying CDM. This is because ACKCHs belonging to consecutive RBs are<br>
mapped to different frequency resources in FIG. 3.<br>
Although an example where length-4 sequences are applied separately for<br>
each RE group is shown in FIG. 3 and FIG. 4, if a real part and an imaginary part<br>
separately carry one sequence chip during ACK/NACK signal transmission, length-8<br>
sequences can be applied. In this case, 8 different ACKCHs can be transmitted on<br>
one RE group.<br>
Meanwhile, FIG. 5A showing an example where ACKCH resources are<br>
allocated to several cells is an example where RE groups 306~311 allocated to<br>
ACKCH of FIG. 3, referred to herein as ACKCH RE groups, are mapped to physical<br>
resources at regular frequency intervals. That is, RE groups 501, 502 and 503<br>
correspond to RE groups 306, 307 and 308 of FIG. 3, respectively. The RE groups<br>
501-503 are spaced apart from each other at intervals of two RBs. In FIGS. 5A and<br>
5B, Cell#11, Cell#12 and Cell#13 are cells belonging to the same base station, and<br>
similarly, Cell#21 and Cell#23 are also cells belonging to the same base station.<br>
However, Cell#11, Cell#21 and Cell#31 are cells belonging to different base stations.<br>
Aside from the RE groups 501~503 for ACKCH transmission, FIGS. 5A and 5B<br>
show REs 504 and 505 mapped to a Reference Signal (RS) for channel estimation<br>
and REs 506 mapped to control channels and data.<br>
According to the ACKCH transmission method shown in FIG. 3, ACKCH<br>
corresponding to a data channel transmitted using three or more arbitrary consecutive<br>
RBs can always be transmitted using all of RE groups 501, 502, 503, making it<br>
possible to improve frequency diversity gain and inter-cell interference diversity gain<br>
as compared with the case where only one of the RE groups 501-503 is used.<br>
Similarly, when two consecutive RBs are allocated for data channel transmission,<br>
two RE groups among the RE groups 501~503 are always selected for transmission<br>
of ACKCH, making it possible to obtain improved performance.<br>
Meanwhile, each ACKCH RE group shown in FIG. 5A has a cell-specific<br>
offset to reduce interference between ACKCHs of different cells. For example,<br>
since Cell#l 1, Cell#12 and Cell#13 belong to the same base station, ACKCHs from<br>
the cells are transmitted on different REs, preventing occurrence of mutual<br>
interference. However, since there is a limitation on the applicable offset value,<br>
there is a possible case where some ACKCHs from different cells use the same REs<br>
as done in Cell#21 and Cell#31.<br>
Shown in FIG. 5B is an example where the ACKCH RE groups 306-311<br>
have the cell-specific random frequency interval. Therefore, while RE groups<br>
corresponding to ACKCHs show a distance difference corresponding to the same<br>
frequency offset between two arbitrary cells in FIG. 5A, an interval between<br>
ACKCH RE groups is random in FIG. 5B, making it possible to more randomize<br>
interference from ACKCHs of different cells. Even in FIG. 5B, regarding ACKCH<br>
RE mapping with RB in each cell, when more than two consecutive RBs are used for<br>
data channel transmission as described above, at least two RE groups among the RE<br>
groups 501-503 are used for ACKCH transmission, contributing to improvement of<br>
frequency diversity, and since random inter-cell ACKCH RE mapping is applied, an<br>
inter-cell ACKCH interference randomization effect can further increase.<br>
FIG. 6 is a control flow diagram illustrating an ACKCH transmission<br>
procedure of a transmission apparatus of a base station according to the first<br>
embodiment of the present invention. In the transmission procedure of FIG. 6,<br>
when multiple RBs are allocated to a data channel, the RBs are assumed to be<br>
consecutive to each other. In step 600, the transmission apparatus of the base<br>
station determines an ACK/NACK value according to the decoding result on a data<br>
channel received from a UE, and prepares to transmit an ACKCH signal. In step<br>
601, the transmission apparatus of the base station checks the number of RBs<br>
allocated to the received data channel, and when only one RB is allocated for the<br>
data channel, the transmission apparatus of the base station maps an ACK/NACK<br>
signal to an ACKCH RE group mapped to the RB in step 602. Thereafter, in step<br>
603, the transmission apparatus of the base station multiplies the ACK/NACK signal<br>
by a CDM sequence for each of the ACKCH resources separately for each RE.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, when RB#1 is allocated to the data channel, a sequence allocated<br>
to ACKCH resource of a corresponding RE group is multiplied separately for each<br>
RE group as shown by reference numeral 402.<br>
Since three different RE groups 501, 502 and 503 are defined as frequency<br>
resources for transmitting ACKCH as shown in FIGS. 5A and 5B, the transmission<br>
apparatus of the base station determines in step 610 whether the number of RBs<br>
allocated for transmission of the data channel is greater than three, and when two or<br>
three RBs are allocated to the data channel, the transmission apparatus of the base<br>
station maps a transmission ACK/NACK signal to an ACKCH RE group mapped to<br>
the RBs in step 604. Referring to FIG. 3, when RB#2 and RB#3 are allocated to the<br>
data channel, the transmission apparatus of the base station maps the ACK/NACK<br>
signal to RE groups 307, 308, 310 and 311 mapped thereto. When the number of<br>
sets of frequency resources for transmitting ACKCH is not three, the number of RBs,<br>
which is a criterion for determination in step 610, can be changed according thereto.<br>
Meanwhile, the number of RBs, which is a criterion for determination in step 610,<br>
can be set to two rather than three regardless of the number of sets. In this case,<br>
when multiple RBs are allocated to the data channel, the transmission apparatus of<br>
the base station only needs to always use only two ACKCH resources regardless of<br>
the number of allocated RBs. In step 605, the transmission apparatus of the base<br>
station multiplies each of RE groups, to which the ACK/NACK signal is mapped in<br>
step 604, by a corresponding CDM sequence.<br>
However, if the base station determines in step 610 that the number of RBs<br>
allocated to the data channel exceeds three, the transmission apparatus of the base<br>
station selects ACKCH resources mapped to RBs corresponding to the first three<br>
indexes among the RBs in step 606. Referring to FIG. 3, when RB#2~RB#7 are<br>
allocated to the data channel, ACKCH resources 314, 315 and 316 corresponding to<br>
RB#2, RB#3 and RB#4 are selected. In step 607, the transmission apparatus of the<br>
base station maps the ACK/NACK signal to the ACKCH resources selected in step<br>
606. In step 608, the transmission apparatus of the base station multiplies the<br>
ACK/NACK signal by CDM sequences corresponding to the ACKCH resources<br>
separately for each RE group.<br>
Thereafter, in step 609, the transmission apparatus of the base station adjusts<br>
a transmission level of a signal on ACKCH RE according to the number of RE<br>
groups used for ACKCH channel transmission for the data channel. For example,<br>
when the number of RBs allocated to the data channel is three, the level is adjusted<br>
to 1/3, compared to when the number of RBs is one. This is to keep the total power<br>
of the transmission ACKCH signal constant regardless of the number of RE groups<br>
used for the ACKCH transmission. Finally, in step 611, the ACKCH signal is<br>
mapped to a corresponding Inverse Fast Fourier Transformer (IFFT) input of the<br>
transmitter separately for each RE allocated for the ACKCH, and then transmitted.<br>
The same transmission procedure can be applied even when the number of RBs<br>
allocated to the data channel, which is a criterion for determination in step 610, is set<br>
to two and ACKCH resources corresponding to the first two RBs are selected in step<br>
606.<br>
FIG. 7 is a control flow diagram illustrating an ACKCH reception procedure<br>
of a reception apparatus of a UE according to the first embodiment of the present<br>
invention. In step 700, the UE prepares to receive ACKCH from a base station<br>
after transmitting a previously scheduled data channel. Thereafter, the UE<br>
determines the number of RBs scheduled for the data channel in step 701, and if only<br>
one RB is allocated, the UE receives the ACKCH signal from the Fast Fourier<br>
Transformer (FFT) outputs of the receiver corresponding to ACKCH REs mapped to<br>
the RB in step 702. In step 703, the UE despreads the ACKCH signal received in<br>
step 702 using sequences corresponding to the ACKCH resources.<br>
However, if the UE determines in step 701 that the number of RBs scheduled<br>
for the data channel is greater than one, the UE proceeds to step 710 where the UE<br>
determines whether the number of RBs allocated to the data channel is greater than<br>
three. If the number of allocated RBs is two or three, the UE proceeds to step 704<br>
where the UE receives the ACKCH signal from FFT outputs corresponding to the<br>
ACKCH REs mapped to the RBs. Thereafter, in step 705, the UE despreads the<br>
ACKCH signal received in step 704 using sequences corresponding to the ACKCH<br>
resources.<br>
However, if the UE determines in step 710 that the number of RBs allocated<br>
to the data channel is greater than three, the UE proceeds to step 706 where the UE<br>
selects ACKCH resources mapped to the first three RB indexes among the RBs.<br>
Thereafter, the UE receives an ACKCH signal from FFT outputs corresponding to<br>
the selected resources in step 707, and then despreads the received ACKCH signal<br>
using sequences corresponding to the ACKCH resources in step 708. Thereafter, in<br>
step 709, the UE determines whether an ACK/NACK signal is received from the<br>
despread ACKCH signal.<br>
FIG. 8 is a diagram illustrating a structure of the transmission apparatus of<br>
the base station of FIG. 6 according to the first embodiment of the present invention.<br>
An ACK/NACK symbol generator 801 generates an ACK/NACK symbol for a data<br>
channel according to the decoding success/failure result of a data channel decoder<br>
805. A spreader 802 multiplies the generated ACK/NACK symbol by a CDM<br>
sequence corresponding to ACKCH resource allocated for transmission of the<br>
ACK/NACK symbol to thereby spread the ACK/NACK symbol. Also, the spreader<br>
802 performs scaling on a level of a transmission ACK/NACK signal as done in step<br>
609 of FIG. 6. An ACKCH format controller 806 determines an ACKCH format,<br>
i.e., spreading gain and ACKCH resources for transmission of ACKCH, according to<br>
the number of RBs allocated to the data channel and their indexes, and controls the<br>
spreader 802 and a subcarrier mapper 803 depending on the determined ACKCH<br>
format. The subcarrier mapper 803, under the control of the ACKCH format<br>
controller 806, applies the ACKCH symbols spread by the spreader 802 to inputs of<br>
an IFFT 804, which are associated with REs of the ACKCH resources. An output<br>
signal of the IFFT 804 is finally transmitted to a UE via an Intermediate Frequency<br>
(IF)/Radio Frequency (RF) stage.<br>
FIG. 9 is a diagram illustrating a structure of a reception apparatus of a UE<br>
of FIG. 7 according to the first embodiment of the present invention. A signal<br>
received at the UE from a base station is first converted into a frequency-domain<br>
signal by an FFT 901, and then applied to an input of a subcarrier demapper 902.<br>
The subcarrier demapper 902 receives an output of the FFT 901, and outputs spread<br>
ACKCH symbols corresponding to ACKCH resources to be received. Since an<br>
ACKCH demapping controller 905 can implicitly determine the ACKCH resources<br>
according to the number of RBs used for the previously transmitted data channel and<br>
their indexes, the ACKCH demapping controller 905 controls the subcarrier<br>
demapper 902 and a despreader 903 according thereto. The despreader 903<br>
despreads ACKCH symbols extracted by the subcarrier demapper 902 and applies<br>
the despread ACKCH symbols to an ACK/NACK symbol detector 904. The<br>
ACK/NACK symbol detector 904 determines whether to transmit an ACK/NACK<br>
signal depending on the ACKCH signal despread by the despreader 903.<br>
The foregoing details described in the first embodiment of the present<br>
invention can also be applied to the case where ACKCH resources are mapped to<br>
CCEs as shown in FIG. 2B. That is, resources to be used for ACKCH transmission<br>
are determined according to indexes of CCEs used for transmission of a downlink<br>
control channel where a data channel is scheduled for the UE. In the mapping<br>
structure of FIG. 3 and the transmission/reception procedures of FIGS. 6 and 7, when<br>
the CCEs allocated to the control channel are applied in place of the RBs allocated to<br>
the data channel, the details described in this first embodiment can be applied in the<br>
same way.<br>
Although a description of the first embodiment of the present invention has<br>
been given for allocation of downlink ACK/NACK physical channel resources for<br>
uplink data channels, the same can be applied even for allocation of uplink<br>
ACK/NACK physical channel resources for downlink data channels when an OFDM<br>
transmission technology is applied in the uplink. In addition, when resources are<br>
allocated to the data channel in units of two RBs rather than one RB, one ACKCH<br>
resource is mapped to two RBs in FIGS. 2A and 2B. Accordingly, the present<br>
invention can be applied in units of physical resources allocated to data channels.<br>
A second embodiment of the present invention applies the ACKCH resource<br>
allocation method shown in FIG. 3 to uplink MU-MIMO.<br>
MU-MIMO refers to the case where more than two different users are<br>
simultaneously allocated the same RBs for data channel transmission. Generally, a<br>
base station orders two users having a low spatial channel correlation to transmit the<br>
same RBs over data channels, and the reception apparatus of the base station<br>
successfully decodes the data channels received from the two users, thereby<br>
improving utilization efficiency of uplink physical resources.<br>
FIG. 10 is a diagram illustrating a format example of a scheduling channel<br>
for uplink MU-MIMO transmission according to the second embodiment of the<br>
present invention. A base station transmits the scheduling channel having the<br>
format of FIG. 10 to a UE. UE ID field 1000 indicates ID information of a UE<br>
undergoing channel scheduling. Resource allocation information for transmission<br>
of a data channel is carried on a resource indication field 1001, Transport Format<br>
(TF) information such as Modulation and Coding Set (MCS) level and payload size<br>
is carried on a Transport format field 1002, and HARQ-related information such as<br>
HARQ redundancy version and process number is carried on an FtARQ information<br>
field 1003. A value of 0 or 1 is set in a MU-MIMO UE flag bit field 1004 for a UE<br>
receiving the scheduling channel. That is, the scheduling information is transmitted<br>
to two UEs performing MU-MIMO transmission on the same RBs, and the field<br>
1004 is differently set to 0 and 1 separately for the two UEs.<br>
Therefore, regarding a UE for which the MU-MIMO UE flag bit field 1004<br>
is set to 0 and a UE for which the MU-MIMO UE flag bit field 1004 is set to 1, data<br>
channels undergo MU-MIMO transmission through the same RBs but pilot signals<br>
for channel estimation for the data channels are mapped to orthogonality-satisfied<br>
physical resources before transmission so the base station can receive the pilot<br>
signals from the two UEs without mutual interference. Further, for the data packets<br>
received from the two UEs, ACKCHs transmitted in the downlink are also set such<br>
that they can be transmitted to the two UEs without mutual interference.<br>
Aside from the fields 1000~1004, additional information can be transmitted<br>
on the scheduling channel, and the present invention has no limitation on<br>
transmission of the additional information. Although the embodiment considers the<br>
case where two UEs simultaneously make MU-MIMO transmission on the same RBs,<br>
the same can be applied even to the case where N arbitrary UEs simultaneously<br>
make MU-MIMO transmission. For example, when MU-MIMO transmission is<br>
allowed for a maximum of four UEs, the MU-MIMO UE flag is composed of 2 bits<br>
so as to separately designate four users. When MU-MIMO transmission is allowed<br>
for a maximum of N UEs, the MU-MIMO UE flag is set to have log2(N) bits.<br>
When log2(N) is not an integer, the MU-MIMO UE flag preferably has bits, the<br>
number of which is the minimum integer greater than log2(N).<br>
In order to allow ACKCHs transmitted to the two UEs to be transmitted<br>
without mutual interference, for MU-MIMO transmission, more than two RBs are<br>
assumed to be allocated herein, and two UEs are assumed herein to simultaneously<br>
transmit data channels on the more than two same RBs. Similarly, when N UEs<br>
make MU-MIMO transmission, more than N RBs are assumed herein to be allocated.<br>
FIG. 11 illustrates an ACKCH transmission procedure of a base station<br>
according to the second embodiment of the present invention. In the procedure of<br>
FIG. 11, for MU-MIMO transmission, more than two RBs are assumed to be<br>
allocated, and two UEs simultaneously are assumed to transmit data channels on the<br>
more than two same RBs. With reference to FIG. 11, a description will be made of<br>
an ACKCH allocation procedure applied separately to each MU-MIMO user. In<br>
step 1100, a transmission apparatus of the base station determines whether to and<br>
prepares to transmit an ACK/NACK signal depending on the decoding result on a<br>
data channel for a corresponding UE. In step 1101, the base station determines<br>
whether a MU-MIMO UE flag bit field 1004 of the scheduling channel received<br>
from the UE is set to 0 or 1. If the base station determines in step 1101 that the<br>
MU-MIMO UE flag bit field 1004 is set to 0, the base station proceeds to step 1102<br>
where the base station maps a transmission ACK/NACK signal to ACKCH resource<br>
mapped to the smallest even index among the RBs allocated to the UE. However, if<br>
the flag bit is set to 1, the base station proceeds to step 1104 where the base station<br>
maps the transmission ACK/NACK signal to ACKCH resource mapped to the<br>
smallest odd index among the RBs allocated to the UE. In step 1103, the base<br>
station multiplies the ACK/NACK signal mapped to the ACKCH resource by a<br>
sequence to be applied to the ACKCH resource. In step 1104, the base station<br>
finally maps the ACK/NACK signal multiplied by the sequence to IFFT inputs of the<br>
transmitter corresponding to the mapped ACKCH resource before transmission.<br>
Although the flag bit 0 is mapped to the ACKCH resource mapped to the<br>
smallest even index among RBs and the flag bit 1 is mapped to the ACKCH resource<br>
mapped to the smallest odd index among RBs in this embodiment, the embodiment<br>
can alternatively be applied to the opposite case.<br>
Therefore, the ACKCH resources mapped to consecutive RBs are set to use<br>
different frequency resources as shown in FIG. 3, and ACKCHs allocated to two<br>
MU-MIMO UEs are transmitted using the different frequency resources according to<br>
the value of the MU-MIMO UE flag bit field 1004 as described in the procedure of<br>
FIG. 11, making it possible to always prevent interference from occurring regardless<br>
of the power difference between ACKCHs transmitted to the two UEs.<br>
FIG. 12 is a diagram illustrating an ACKCH reception procedure of a UE<br>
according to the second embodiment of the present invention. In step 1200, a UE<br>
prepares to receive ACKCH from a base station after transmitting a previously<br>
scheduled data channel. In step 1201, the UE determines from which ACKCH<br>
resource the UE will receive the ACKCH according to the value of a MU-MIMO UE<br>
flag bit field 1004 of a scheduling channel for the data channel. When the value of<br>
the MU-MIMO UE flag bit field 1004 is 0, the UE receives in step 1202 an ACKCH<br>
signal from FFT outputs of the receiver corresponding to ACKCH resource mapped<br>
to the smallest even index among the RBs allocated to the UE. However, if the<br>
value of the MU-MIMO UE flag bit field 1004 is 1, the UE receives in step 1204 an<br>
ACKCH signal from FFT outputs of the receiver corresponding to ACKCH resource<br>
mapped to the smallest odd index among the RBs allocated to the UE. Thereafter,<br>
the UE despreads the received ACKCH signal using a sequence applied to the<br>
ACKCH resource in step 1203, and finally determines in step 1205 whether an<br>
ACK/NACK signal is received.<br>
Although the ACKCH resource corresponding to the smallest even or odd<br>
index is selected according to the value of the MU-MIMO UE flag bit field 1004 in<br>
the foregoing transmission/reception procedure, other rules can alternatively be<br>
established so frequency resources are used as ACKCH resources transmitted to the<br>
two MU-MIMO transmission UEs, and the present invention has no limitation<br>
thereon.<br>
Regarding the MU-MIMO UE flag bit 1004, when data channels are not<br>
scheduled for MU-MIMO transmission, the base station can set the MU-MIMO UE<br>
flag bit 1004 to an appropriate value according to the need, thereby controlling<br>
ACK/NACK resource allocation. For example, when the UE is allocated several<br>
RBs, ACK/NACK channels can be allowed to be transmitted on frequency resources<br>
where a less number of ACK/NACK channels are allocated, using the MU-MIMO<br>
UE flag bit 1004.<br>
The method described in the second embodiment can be applied even for<br>
downlink MU-MIMO in the same way. In this case, a MU-MIMO UE flag bit field<br>
is defined in a scheduling channel for a downlink data channel as shown by reference<br>
numeral 1004 of FIG. 10, and the base station sets a different value for the MU-<br>
MIMO UE flag bit field in each scheduling channel being transmitted to two UEs<br>
allocated to the same RBs. Thus, in MU-MIMO, when more than two RBs are<br>
allocated to a data channel, the UE transmits an ACK/NACK channel on resources<br>
corresponding to the MU-MIMO UE flag bit value among the ACK/NACK channel<br>
resources mapped to the RBs.<br>
As is apparent from the foregoing description, the present invention maps<br>
ACKCHs mapped to consecutive RBs or consecutive CCEs, to different frequency<br>
resources, so REs used for transmission of the ACKCHs are uniformly distributed<br>
over the entire system band, making it possible to achieve high frequency diversity<br>
gain and inter-cell interference diversity gain and improve ACKCH performance<br>
even in MU-MIMO.<br>
In addition, the present invention contributes to a decrease in the number of<br>
unnecessary data retransmissions by improving ACKCH performance, and an<br>
increase in the system capacity by improving retransmission probability for the data<br>
channel failed in its normal reception.<br>
While the invention has been shown and described with reference to certain<br>
preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that<br>
various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the<br>

channel groups has a maximum value obtained by dividing a number of resource<br>
blocks used for transmission of the data channel, by four.<br>
11. The method of claim 9, wherein a sequence is defined by<br>
multiplying an orthogonal sequence by a cell-specific random sequence.<br>
12. The method of claim 9, wherein power between the ACK/NACK<br>
signal channel groups is constant.<br>
13. A method for allocating physical resources to an Acknowledgement<br>
(ACK)/Negative Acknowledgement (NACK) signal channel representative of a<br>
response signal in a wireless communication system, the method comprising:<br>
decoding a data channel and a control channel received through a plurality of<br>
resource blocks;<br>
generating an ACK/NACK symbol according to success/failure in the<br>
decoding;<br>
grouping ACK/NACK signal channels corresponding to the resource blocks<br>
into a plurality of groups according to a number of and indexes of the resource<br>
blocks so ACK/NACK signal channels having consecutive indexes do not belong to<br>
the same group;<br>
allocating same frequency resources to ACK/NACK signal channels<br>
belonging to the same ACK/NACK signal channel group and allocating orthogonal<br>
sequences so ACK/NACK signal channels in each ACK/NACK signal channel<br>
group are distinguished in a code domain; and<br>
multiplying the generated ACK/NACK symbol by a sequence allocated to an<br>
ACK/NACK signal channel for transmitting the generated ACK/NACK symbol, to<br>
spread the generated ACK/NACK symbol.<br>
14. An apparatus for allocating physical resources to an<br>
Acknowledgement (ACK)/Negative Acknowledgement (NACK) signal channel<br>
representative of a response signal in a wireless communication system, the<br>
apparatus comprising:<br>
a channel decoder for decoding a data channel and a control channel<br>
received through a plurality of resource blocks;<br>
an ACK/NACK symbol generator for generating an ACK/NACK symbol<br>
according to success/failure in the decoding by the channel decoder;<br>
an ACK/NACK signal channel format controller for grouping ACK/NACK<br>
signal channels corresponding to the resource blocks into a plurality of groups<br>
according to a number of and indexes of the resource blocks so ACK/NACK signal<br>
channels having consecutive indexes do not belong to the same group, allocating<br>
same frequency resources to ACK/NACK signal channels belonging to the same<br>
ACK/NACK signal channel group, and allocating orthogonal sequences so<br>
ACK/NACK signal channels in each ACK/NACK signal channel group are<br>
distinguished in a code domain; and<br>
a spreader for multiplying the generated ACK/NACK symbol by a sequence<br>
allocated to an ACK/NACK signal channel for transmitting the generated<br>
ACK/NACK symbol, to spread the generated ACK/NACK symbol.<br><br><br><br>
A method for allocating physical resources to an<br>
Acknowledgement (ACK)/Negative Acknowledgement (NACK)<br>
signal channel representative of a response signal in a<br>
wireless communication system. The method includes<br>
grouping ACK/NACK signal channels corresponding to a<br>
plurality of resource blocks used for transmission of a<br>
data channel or a control channel into a plurality of<br>
groups so ACK/NACK signal channels having consecutive<br>
indexes do not belong to the same group; and allocating<br>
same frequency resources to ACK/NACK signal channels<br>
belonging to the same ACK/NACK signal channel group and<br>
allocating orthogonal sequences so ACK/NACK signal<br>
channels in each ACK/NACK signal channel group are<br>
distinguished in a code domain.</td>
