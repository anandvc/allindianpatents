CONTROLLED RELEASE COOLING ADDITIVE COMPOSITION<br>
This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Patent Application Serial Number 09/781,842, filed February 12, 2001, the disclosure of which is incorporated in its entirety herein by reference.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Traditionally, additives such as anti-foulants, anti-scaling agents, corrosion inhibitors, buffering and pH agents, microbiocides and the like are added directly to the solutions of aqueous systems as needed to prevent scale deposition, corrosion of metal surfaces and similar fouling of the aqueous systems, as well to maintain proper pH levels. As used herein, an aqueous system may include, without limitation, a cooling system, an open recirculating cooling water system, a closed loop boiler water system and an engine cooling system.<br>
In certain aqueous systems, it is important to maintain a steady level of additives. For example, the presence of microbiocides is especially important in an aqueous system such as cooling systems employed in cooling towers. Cooling towers usually maintain a cooling system for a considerable length of time. Typically, such cooling systems do not have sufficient aeration and exposure to sunlight to prevent microbial, especially bacterial and fungal, growth. In particular, many cooling systems use fill composed of beads of synthetic polymer or other materials, in order to extend the amount of heat exchange surface area. This type of construction greatly aggravates the problem of microbiological growth, since it provides an ideal physical environment for the propagation of troublesome microbes. If left untreated, such microorganisms may flourish and produce colonies extensive enough to give rise to problems of biofilm blockage of heat exchange<br><br>
surfaces, as well as clogging of the components of the water transporting apparatus used in operating the aqueous system,<br>
Various methods of introducing 'additives to an aqueous system have been developed. For instance, a solid additive material may be added directly to the aqueous system which dissolves in the aqueous system. However, this method cannot maintain a steady concentration level of additive within the system. Initially, there would be a high level of the additives released into the system, and within a short time the additives are depleted. Additionally, a significant draw back of this method is the danger of overdosing the system with particular additives which are initially released. The overdosing is dangerous in that it can result in erosion and corrosion problems.<br>
Minimal attempts have been made in the prior art to address particular water treatment systems by using controlled release coatings. For example, Characklis in U.S. Pat. No. 4,561,981 (issued Dec. 31, 1985) disclosed a method for controlling, preventing or removing fouling deposits, particularly in pipelines, storage tanks and the like by mircroencapsulating fouling control chemicals in a slow release coating. The coating material is described as being any material compatible with the fouling control chemical which is capable of sticking to the fouling deposit site. However, the coating materials as disclosed by Characklis may dissolve in a cooling system and create further corrosion problems'.<br>
Recently, Mitchell et al. in U.S. Patent No. 6,010,639 disclosed that a terpolymer may be used as a coating for cooling additives.<br>
Pump systems have been developed to provide for a more steady and controlled release of additives into an aqueous system, such as an open recirculating system.<br><br>
For example, a commonly used system to introduce additives into an open recirculating system comprises a monitor, liquid additives and a pump. The monitor checks the concentration of the additive concentration in the open recirculating system and activates the pump to pump more additives into the open recirculating system when the additive levels are low.<br>
However, despite the efforts of the prior art, a need still exists for a controlled release cooling treatment composition. Also, the use of monitors and pumps to provide for controlled release of additives may require a high degree of maintenance. Furthermore, the existing pump systems may expose workers to harm, such as splashing of chemicals. A need still exists for a more effective system to provide for a controlled release of additives.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a controlled release additive composition for aqueous systems. This invention provides for delayed and more effectively complete release of additive components. Such release helps maintain a consistent level of additive components in the aqueous system over an extended period of time. Preferably, the additive components comprises additives. As used herein, the term ^'additive" includes all materials which can be compounded or admixed with the additive compositions and which impart beneficial properties to the aqueous system. For example, an additive may comprise a. microbiocide that is compatible with aqueous systems.<br>
More particularly, the present invention provides a controlled release additive composition for cooling systems, preferably open recirculating cooling water system.<br><br>
In one embodiment, a controlled release cooling composition has a core containing a water-soluble cooling additive component and a coating substantially surrounding the core.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the coating is a polymer made up of units from no more than two monomers. More preferably, the units include vinylacetate and vinyl versatate.<br>
The additive component has at least one active ingredient selected from the group consisting of microbiocides, buffering components, captivation liner pitting inhibitors, metal corrosion and hot surface corrosion inhibitors, defoaming agents, hot surface deposition, scale inhibitors, dispersant agents, surfactants and mixtures thereof,<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the additive component also includes sodium nitrite, sodium nitrate and sodium molybdate.<br>
Additionally, the present invention features a system which provides for controlled release of additives into an aqueous system, for example open recirculating system, without having to rely on monitors and pumps. Furthermore, the present invention provides for a safer system and method of providing additives to an aqueous system.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, a liquid replacement system for providing additives to an open recirculating system is provided. The liquid replacement system comprises a make-up line and an additive system disposed therein. The additive system is structured to provide a controlled release of an additive to a make-up liquid flowing through the make-up line. The make-up liquid carries the additives into the open recirculating system.<br>
Further in accordance with the present invention, the make-up line fluidly connects with a source line.<br><br>
The make-up liquid originates from the source line and at least a fraction of the make-up liquid enters into the make-up line. In one embodiment, the fraction of the make-up liquid passing through the make-up line is controlled by a valve. For example, a valve located in the source line or make-up line may be adjusted to allow a specific flow. In one embodiment, less than about 50%, for example less than about 10%, of the make-up liquid originating from the source line enter into the make-up line.<br>

Still further in accordance with the present invention, the source line further fluidly connects with an additional make-up line. In one embodiment, about less than about 90%, for example about 50%, of the flow of the make-up liquid originating from the source line enter into the additional make-up line. In one embodiment, the flow rate of the make-up liquid flowing through the additional make-up line is slower than the flow rate of the make-up liquid flowing through the source line.<br>
Still further in accordance with the present invention, the additive system comprises a container having an additive composition therein. Furthermore, the container is structured to allow for the make-up liquid to come into contact with the additive composition. In one embodiment, the additive composition comprises an additive component and a controlled release component.<br>
Still further in accordance with the present invention, the controlled release component functions to delay the release of- additives of an additive composition. In one embodiment, the controlled release component may comprise a polymer of any type, provided<br><br>
that the polymer is substantially effective in providing a controlled release of the additives of the additive composition.<br>
Still further in accordance with the present invention, the liquid replacement system comprises a source line, a first make-up line, a second make-up line and an additive system, including a additive component, disposed in the finish make-up line. The source line fluidly connects with the finish make-up line and the second make-up line. The make-up liquid passes from the source line and enters into at least one of the first make-up line and the second make-up line. The additive system is structured to provide a controlled release of the additive component to the make-up liquid passing through the first make-up line, which carries the additive component into the open recirculating system or the closed loop boiler water system.<br>

Detailed Deacription of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a liquid replacement system capable of providing additives to an aqueous system in a controlled manner, without the use of monitors and/or pumps. Preferably, the aqueous system is an open recirculating system, for example a cooling tower. In a broad embodiment, the liquid replacement system comprises a make-up line and an additive system disposed therein, A make-up liquid enters into the make-up line where the additive system is structured to provide a controlled release of an additive to the make-up liquid, and the make-up liquid carries the additives into the open recirculating system.<br>
In one embodiment, the make-up line fluidly connects with a source line, where the source line provides for at least a fraction of the make-up liquid that enters into the make-up line. The source line may also fluidly connect with an additional make-up line,<br><br>
where at least a fraction of the make-up fluid enters into the additional make-up line. In one embodiment, the source line f luidly connects to more than one additional make-up line, for example two or three additional make-up line's.<br>
A source line comprises a liquid conduit, for example a tube, carrying make-up liquid to replenish the open recirculating system. In one embodiment, the makeup liquid comprises a liquid derived from a municipal water source. The source line terminates and becomes a make-up line and/or additional make-up line. In one embodiment, the source line terminates and become makeup line. In one embodiment, the source line terminates and becomes make-up line and additional make-up line. In one embodiment, the source line terminates and becomes a make-up line and two additional make-up lines.<br>
Make-up line and additional make-up line differ in that make-up line has to have an additive system disposed therein, and additional make-up line may or may not have an additive system disposed therein.<br>
In one embodiment, the make-up line comprises a liquid conduit, for example a tube, where an additive system may be fluidly connected. In one embodiment, the make-up line ends at the point where it feeds into the open recirculating system. For example, the make-up line ends at the point where it feeds into the open recirculating system, Figure 1. In one embodiment, the make-up line ends at the point where it feeds into additional make-up line, Figure 2.<br>
The additional make-up line comprises a water conduit, for example a tube, which begins where the source line ends. In one embodiment, the additional make-up line does not have an additive system disposed therein. In one embodiment, the additional make-up line comprises an additive system disposed therein, similarly to the make-up line. Preferably, the additional make-up line terminates at the point where it feeds into the<br><br>
additive system 114b comprising a container 116b. The source line 120b feeds the make-up liquid 122b into the make-up line 112b and the additional make-up line 124b. Downstream, the make-up line 112b feeds into the additional make-up line 124b. The additional make-up line begins where the source line 12 0b ends and feeds directly into the open recirculating system 118b. Valves 12 6b are placed at various locations in the source line 120b; make-up line 112b and additional makeup line 124b to control the flow of the make-up fluid 122b. A temperature sensor/meter 150b (TM) may be placed, for example, in the source line. Also, a flow meter 156b (FM) may be placed, for example, in the makeup line to detect the flow rate therein. Furthermore, a pressure sensor/meter 158b (PM) may be placed, for example, in the make-up line to detect the pressure therein. The cooled liquid in the cooling tower may be recycled or eliminated. For example, the cool liquid from the cooling tower is recycled by passing through a heat exchanger 152b (HE) , capturing the heat, and flowing back into the cooling tower as hot/warm liquid. The cooled liquid may be eliminated, for example, through a blowdown drain 154b (BD).<br>
Figure 3 shows a liquid replacement system 210. The make-up line 212 is adaptable for attaching an additive system 214 comprising a container 216. The make-up line feeds directly into an open recirculating system 218. The source line 22 0 feeds the make-up liquid 222 into the make-up line 212 and the additional make-up line 224. The additional make-up line begins where the source line . 22 ends and feeds directly into the open recirculating system 218. The make-up line also feeds into the additional make-up line via a shunt 228 Valves 226 are placed at various locations in the source line 220, make-up line 212, additional make-up line 224 and shunt 228 to control the flow of the makeup fluid 222,<br><br>
Figure 4 shows a system which is presently being used to provide for additives into the open recirculating system 318. The presently used system comprises a monitor 375 which checks for the level of additives in the open recirculating system. When appropriate; the monitor triggers a pump 377 to pump additives (from the additive tank) into a make-up line 381. The make-up line 381 feeds the make-up fluid 322 and the additives into the open recirculating system 318.<br>
The fraction of the make-up fluid originating from the source line which enters into the make-up line and/or additional make-up line is controlled by a valve, for example a solenoid valve. For example, the fraction of the make-up fluid originating from the source line entering into the make-up line and additional make-up line may be controlled by valves located in the make-up line and additional make-up line, respectively.<br>
In one embodiment, about less than 50%, preferably less than 10%, of the make-up liquid originating from the source line enter into the make-up line. In one embodiment, the flow rate of the make-up liquid flowing through the make-up line is slower than the flow rate of the make-up liquid flowing through the source line. For example, the flow rate of the make-up liquid through the source line is about 1 gallon/min to about 100 gallon/min, and the flow rate through the make-up line is about 1 gallon/min to about 10 gallon/min. In a preferred embodiment, the flow rate of the make-up liquid through the make-up line is about 3 gallon/min. Preferably, a sufficient volume of make-up liquid flows through make-up line per minute to provide for the desired amount of additive into the open recirculating system.<br>
In one embodiment, about less than 90%, for example 50%, of the flow of the make-up liquid originating from the source line enter into the additional make-up line.<br><br>
In one embodiment, the flow rate of the make-up liquid flowing through the additional make-up line is slower than the flow rate of the make-up liquid flowing through the source line. For example, the flow rate of the make-up liquid through the source line is about 1 gallon/min to about 100 gallon/min, and the flow rate through the additional make-up line is about 50 gallon/min to about 90 gallon/min. If the additional make-up line also comprises an additive system therein, a adequate volume of make-up liquid should flow through to provide for the desired amount of additive into the open recirculating system.<br>
In one embodiment, the volume of the make-up liquid entering into an open recirculating system is about equal to the rate of loss in volume in the open recirculating system. The loss in volume may be through evaporation, drift and/or blowdown. For example, in a 100 ton open recirculating system, about 2-10 gallons of liquid are loss per minute; thus, the volume of make-up liquid entering into the open recirculating system should be about the same to compensate for the volume loss.<br>
In one embodiment, the make-up line is a first make-up line, and the additional make-up line is a second make-up line.<br>
The additive system disposed in the make-up line is structured to provide controlled release of an additive to the make-up liquid passing through the make-up line. For example, an additive system in accordance with the present invention comprises at least one container, or canister, which is at least partially filled with an additive comiposition. Furthermore, the container may be fluidly connected to the make-up line to allow the makeup fluid to flow into the container to mix with the additive composition and to flow out of the container carrying additive components into the open recirculating system.<br><br>
In one embodiment, the containers comprises a housing and an inner cartridge. The housing may be constructed out of, for example HDPE, PP, PVC, stainless steel, yellow metal alloys and the like. The inner cartridge fits inside the outer housing. The inner cartridge may be constructed from the same or different material as the outer housing. In one embodiment, the dimensions of the inner cartridge is about 4.5 inch by 20 inch. Other sizes are available. The container may be attached to the make-up line (and/or additional makeup line) through a pipe, for example a PVC, copper and/or galvanized pipe NPT pipe. The housing may be fitted with female pipe threads at both ends. The thread is usually about 0.75 to about 1.5 NPT.<br>
The housing and the replaceable cartridges may be purchased from Flowmatic Systems, in Dunnellon, Florida; Harmscon Filtration Products, in Palm Beach, Florida; or Cole Parmer Instrument, in Vernon Hills, Illinois.<br>
In one embodiment, a container for a 100 ton cooling tower may be purchased from Flowmatic with the following specifications: filter housing #FH10000WW1PR<br>
4 Y,' X 20", empty cartridge # GAC BB20 REW 4 W x 20". The cartridge can hold about 8 pounds of coated tablets, wherein the size of each coated tablet may be about 3/8" x 3/8". A typical release rate for such container is about 12 ppm in 60 minutes (50 ppm total at 4 cycles of concentration) or 0,21 ppm/minute at a flow rate of 2 gallon per minute through the housing.<br>
In one embodiment, each container is configured to release about 0.1 to about 10 ppm of an additive at about 2 to about 4 gallon/min. In a preferred embodiment, each container is configured to releases release about 0, 5 to about 5 ppm of an additive at about 3 to about gallon/min. In a more preferred embodiment, each container is configured to releases release about 1 ppm of an additive at about 3 gallon/min.<br>
The number of containers and the release rate of<br><br>
the additives by the container may be modified to meet a particular specification. For example, to increase the release rate of additives, more containers may be added to the make-up line, and vice versa. Also, the degree of which the additive compositions are packed in the containers may be adjusted to vary the release rate of additives. For example, a looser packing of the additive compositions allows for a higher release rate, and vice versa.<br>
An additive composition of this invention may be any composition which releases additives in a liquid media, for example a make-up fluid. Preferably, the additive composition releases additives slowly over a period of time, in a controlled manner. It is believed that the use of additives compositions is safer over the use of pumps. For example, the use of additive compositions avoid the splashing of chemicals which is commonly associated with a pump system.<br>
In one embodiment, the additive composition comprises a controlled release component and an additive component. The controlled release component provides for controlled release of the additive component. Furthermore, the controlled release component may comprise any material, for example polymers, which could delay the release of an additive. Controlled release components may comprise polymers disclosed in, for example, Mitchell et al U.S. 5,741,433; Mitchell et al U.S. Patent 6,010,63 9; Brown U.S. Patent 5,8 03,024; Hudgens et al U.S. Patent 5,662,799; Hudgens et al U.S. Patent 5,662,799 and Dobrez et al U.S. Patent 4,842,731; Characklis U.S. Pat. No. 4,561,981; Blakemore et al U.S. Patent Application 09/539,914, the disclosures of which are incorporated in their entirety herein by reference.<br>
In one embodiment, the additive composition comprises a matrix constructed from the controlled release component and the additive component.<br>
In  one  embodiment,  the  additive  composition<br><br>
comprises a core comprising the additive component and a   controlled .  release   component   substantially surrounding, or coating, the core.  In one embodiment, the coating is water soluble.  In one embodiment, the coating is water insoluble.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the additive composition comprises a core containing a water-soluble additive component and a controlled release component coating encapsulating said core which enables the slow release of the additive component into the open recirculating cooling water system. Any type of coating conventionally known in . the art which provides controlled-release properties may be used in the present invention.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the coating is a polymer commercially available as a water dispersion- More preferably, the polymer dispersion has the following properties:<br>
1.	Low viscosity: The polymer dispersion should<br>
be of a low to medium viscosity. When the viscosity is<br>
too high, it would become impossible to pump 'the polymer<br>
dispersion through a coating system. This would cause<br>
the line and spray gun to become plugged. Also, in this<br>
case, the droplets of polymer dispersion would be too<br>
thick and difficult to lose moisture. They would not<br>
have the desired level of dryness before they reach the<br>
tablet surface. Therefore, the polymer would not form<br>
a good and homogeneous coating.<br>
It should be noted that reducing the viscosity of a polymer dispersion through dilution with water is not always a viable solution. Often the dilution leads to changes of physical properties for the polymer dispersion and renders the polymer not appropriate for coating applications.<br>
2.	Low film forming and glass transition<br>
temperatures: Every polymer has its own characteristic<br>
film  forming  temperature  and  glass   transition<br><br>
temperature, Tg. To form a good coating, the polymer must have a film forming temperature lower than the operating temperatures inside the chamber of the drum coater in the coating process. A high Tg would lead to a brittle and fragile film which may easily peel off. Generally, a polymer with lower film forming temperature and Tg forms better film than those polymers with higher corresponding temperatures.<br>
3.	Good film forming ability onto tablet surface: In the early stage of coating process, the polymer has to have good adherence to the tablet surface, so that the coating film can gradually build up. The polymer particles should pack well without large spaces or holes in between. This can be examined and confirmed under a microscope. Typically the polymer with small particle size will result in better packing. Also, the polymer must possess good elasticity; otherwise, the coating would crack, especially upon cooling.<br>
4.	Insolubility of the polymer in an operating aqueous system: Typically, an operating aqueous system, has high temperatures. For example, an operating open recirculating cooling water system is about 70 degrees F to about 150 degrees F, preferably about 80 degrees F to about 100 degrees F, more preferably about 90 degrees F to about 95 degrees F. The polymer coatings should be able to remain insoluble and stable in these systems. If the polymer coating dissolves, it will lose the slow release function.<br>
5.	Stability of polymer coating in solutions of aqueous systems under operating conditions: Many polymers degrade because they undergo alkaline hydrolysis reaction in operating aqueous system conditions. As degradation or dissolution occurs, the coating is damaged. As a result, the coating forms holes and loses the control of slow release. Subsequently, all chemical ingredients rapidly enter the bulk cooling.<br><br>
Without wishing to limit the invention to any particular mechanism or theory of operation, it is believed that the release of ingredients from the ^tablet core into the bulk cooling solution involves three steps: (a) cooling solution enters the inner tablet core through the polymer coating, (b) chemical ingredients of the tablet dissolve in contact with cooling solution and (c) the resulting highly concentrated solution diffuses through the polymer coating back into the bulk cooling solution. The path and size of channels, microscopically, within the polymer coating, which are characteristics of each specific polymer and are closely related to the physical properties of each polymer in cooling solutions at elevated temperatures, control the kinetics of these actions.<br>

U.S. Patent No. 5,662,803, wherein the disclosures of which are incorporated in their entirety herein by reference.<br>
In one embodiment, an additive component comprises one or more of the following: corrosion inhibitors, sodium Molybdate dihydrate, Benzotriazole/Tolytriazole, scale inhibitors, HEDP (1-Hydroxyethylidene-1,1-phosphonic acid) like those from Solutia, Dequest 2016-D, polyacrylate/acrylic acid polymers from Noveon-BFGoodrich, dispersants, sulfonated styrene maleic-anhydride, copolymers from Alco Chemical like Narlex D-72, sulfonated copolymers from Noveon, biocides, chlorine/bromine releasing compounds and indicators.<br>

In one embodiment, the additive component includes nitrite compounds. In a preferred embodiment, the additive component includes a mixture of nitrite compounds and molybdate compounds to maintain a minimum concentration level of about 800 ppm of nitrite or a mixture of nitrite and molybdate in the cooling system, with the proviso that the minimum level of nitrite in the cooling system is about 400 ppm.

The additive component may be in solid, granular or particulate form provided that it does not decompose or melt at processing temperatures. Preferably, the additive component is molded in the form of a pellet or tablet which may have either a spherical or irregular shape. The additive pellet or tablet should be of sufficient size to provide the steady controlled release of the additive components into the cooling system over the desired period of time. Further, when the additive pellet or tablet is used in a filtering environment, it should be larger than the pores or orifices of the filter. Generally, a spherical pellet or tablet should have a diameter on the order of from about 1/32" to about 5,0", preferably from about 2/32" to about 3", more preferably from about 1/8" to about M", even more preferably about 3/8".<br>
The formation of the additive component into a pellet or tablet is dependent upon the mixture of materials contained therein. For example, when the additive component contains a sufficient amount of a dispersing agent or a'mixture of dispersing agents, the dispersing agent or mixture also may function as a binder, thereby allowing the component to be molded or compressed directly into the form of a pellet or tablet. If the additive component does not compact well, a binder must be added to the additive component in order to mold or compress it into a pellet or tablet. Suitable binders include, for example, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, sodium acrylate, sodium polyacrylate, carboxymethylcellulose, sodium carboxyinethylcellulose, corn starch, microcrystalline cellulose, propylene glycol, ethylene glycol, sodium silicate, potassium silicate, methacrylate/acrylate copolymers, sodium lignosulfonate, sodium hydroxypropylcellulose, preferably hydroxyethylcellulose, and water.<br>
Preferably, the additive component to be molded or compressed into a pellet or tablet further comprises a<br><br>
die release agent. Suitable die release agents include, for example, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, zinc stearate, stearic acid, propylene glycol, ethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, polyoxypropylene-polyoxyethylene block copolymers, microcrystalline cellulose, kaolin, attapulgite, magnesium carbonate, fumed silica, magnesium silicate, calcium silicate, silicones, mono-and dicarboxylic acids and corn starch.<br>
To form a controlled release cooling additive composition, the polymeric coating may be applied to the additive composition core by spray coating, microencapsulation or any other coating technique well known to practitioners in the art. Preferably, the polymeric coating is an aqueous dispersion latex which is applied to the additive core pellet or tablet by drum or pan coating. The amount of coating to be applied to the additive core is dependent upon the desired controlled release characteristics of the resulting coated tablet or pellet. An increase in the amount of coating will result in a decrease of the rate' of release of the additive component. Generally, the weight percent of the coating is from about 1.0 to about 40.0% based on the total weight of the additive tablet, preferably from about 2% to about 20% by weight even more preferably about 3% to about 15% by weight. For example, the coatings employed in a cooling tower are about 4% to about 10%, preferably about 8% by weight.<br>
In one broad embodiment, a method is provided for maintaining an effective concentration of at least one additive component in an open recirculating cooling water system. The method includes steps of placing the additive composition, such as the ones described herein, in contact with the open recirculating cooling water. For example, the additive compositions may be placed in containers which are fluidly connected to the make-up line. As the make-up fluid from the make-up line enters<br><br>
the container and mixes with the additive composition, the additive composition releases additives into the make-up fluid. The make-up fluid then carries the additives into the open recirculating system.<br>
In one embodiment, methods for providing controlled release of additives to an open recirculating system may be practiced using the liquid replacement systems described herein. In one embodiment, methods for providing controlled release of additives to an open recirculating system may be practiced using the make-up line described herein. These methods are pump-free and/or monitor free.<br>
The following non-limiting examples illustrate certain aspects of the present invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
Release Characteristics of a Controlled Release<br>
Cooling Additive Composition in a Flask.<br>
The release characteristics of a controlled release cooling additive composition were tested in a flask. In particular, the coating used for the cooling additive composition tested was vinylacetate-vinylversatate copolymer(EMULTEX W575) and the additive component used was DCA-4+ tablet. The finished tablet, weighing 1.462 grams on the average, is of 11mm diameter and contains 26.8% by weight of EMULTEX W575 copolymer solid. The test cooling solution was prepared by mixing equal volume of ethylene glycol and de-ionized water. It also contains potassium phosphate K2HPO4 at 2,000mg/L concentration. The pH of the test solution was adjusted to 10.3 with sodium hydroxide..'<br>
Five coated tablets were stacked inside a polypropylene tube of 92 mm in length, and 14 mm in diameter. The tube, with one side open, has a total of 18 holes distributed evenly around the wall and one hole on the bottom of the tube. Each hole has a diameter of 4 mm.     The tube with the coated tablets was hung<br><br>
inside a 3-neck, 1-Liter, flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar and a cold-water condenser. Then, the flask was filled with 0.900 liters of test cooling solution.<br>
Subsequently, with mixing, the solution was heated to, and kept at, 190+3 degrees F. The release of chemical ingredients from the DCA-4+tablets into the solution was monitored. Samples were taken and analyzed for nitrite, nitrate and molybdate. The percent release with time for each ingredient was calculated as the ratio of measured concentration and expected concentration at full release. The results are shown as percent release with time in Table 2.<br><br>
♦Release factor greater than 100% was due to statistical variations in concentration measurements.<br>
As the data indicate, the ingredients were released gradually with time from the inner DCA-4 + tablet core into the outside test solution.   An effective and<br><br>
substantially complete release was reached for nitrite and nitrate at approximately 80 0 hours, and for molybdate, expectedly, at ap'proximately 1,100 hours.<br>
Using the same flask protocol and conditions as described above, other cooling additive compositions were tested. Table 3 shows the slow release data (% release) for EMULEX W575 at 22.3% coating on DCA-4+ tablets. Table 4 shows the slow release data (% release) for EMULEX W575 at 18.2% coating on DCA-4+ tablets. Table 5 shows the slow release data (% release) for NeoCAR 820 (an acrylate-vinylversatate copolymer) at 30% coating on DCA-4+ tablets. Table 6 shows the slow release data (% release) for ETHOCEL S4 5 at 5% coating on DCA-4+ tablets. Table 7 shows the slow release data of ETHOCEL S4 5 at 15% coating on DCA-4 + tablets.<br>
These data indicate that the ingredients were released gradually with time from the inner DCA-4+tablet core into the outside test solution. Furthermore, as expected, the release rates for the additives are inversely proportional to* the percentages of coating, i.e., coating by EMULEX W575 at 26.8%(Table 2) has slower release rates of the additive components than at 2 2.3% (Table 3) and 18.2% (Table 4) , respectively. Also, with the ETHOCEL polymer, the release rates for the additives are shown to be inversely proportional to the percentages of coating (Tables 6 and 7). TABLE 3<br><br><br><br>
♦Release factor greater than 100% was due to statistical variations in concentration measurements.<br><br>
♦Release factor greater than 100% was due to statistical variations in concentration measurements.<br><br>
TABLE   5<br><br><br><br>
Release Characteristics of a Controlled Release Cooling Additive Composition on a Rig<br>
In one embodiment, the additive compositions may be used in an engine cooling system. Therefore, the performance of the additive compositions were tested on a rig, which simulates an engine cooling system. For example, the performance of vinylacetate-vinylversatate (EMULTEX W575), as a coating for DCA-4+ tablet, a cooling additive, was tested on a rig to simulate an engine cooling system. DCA-4+ tablets coated with 26.8% of EMULTEX W575 were tested. The rig has three major components: a reservoir tank, a radiator and a pump. A heating element was installed inside the tank. In the experiment, a total of 18.4 liters of test cooling .; solution was added into the system. This system is similar to that of the one disclosed by Mitchell et al in U.S. Patent No. 6,010,639, the disclosure of which is incorporated in its entirety by reference herein.<br>
A Fleetguard WF2121 filter was used for the study. It contained a total of 187 pieces of coated DCA-4+tablets inside the center tube of the filter.<br><br>
After the filter was screwed onto the test rig between the reservoir and the radiator, the pump was started to begin the experiment as the test solution was circulated throughout the system. The.flow rate of test solution through the filter was kept at about 1.2 to about 1.5 gallons per minute and the temperature of the bulk test solution was kept at about 190 + 5 degrees F. After every 10 days of running, the system was shut off for 12-48 hours before it was restarted.<br>
Samples were collected with time, analyzed and the percent release of ingredients was calculated, similarly to the experiment in the flask above. Table 3 shows the percent release of the additives with time in a rig.<br><br>
TABLE 8<br><br>
Again, as the data demonstrate, the ingredients were released gradually from the inner DCA-4+tablet core into the outside test cooling solution. The release rate was significantly slower for every ingredient compared to that from the experiment in the flask.<br>
The following example provides those of ordinary skill in the art with specific methods to produce the controlled release cooling additive composition within the scope of the present invention and is not intended<br><br>
to limit the scope of the invention.<br>
Example 3 Method for Making the Controlled Release CoolinQ<br>
Additive Composition<br>
Fleetguard DCA-4+tablets were used. They are composed of nitrite, nitrate, phosphate, silicate, borate, molybdate, tolyltriazole, organic acid, scale inhibitors, surfactants and defearners. The powdery ingredients were mixed first, then pressed into standard-cup tablets using 3/8" tooling. The tablets were of about 1.10 grams in weight and about 8 to about 15 kps in hardness. The Drum Coater was used for coating.<br>
For coating the DCA-4+tablets, the DCA-4+standard-cup tablets were placed onto the rotating pan inside the drum coater. While the pan was being rotated, EMULTEX W575 dispersion was pumped and sprayed through a nozzle onto the tablet surface. The spray rate is important. It was maintained at about 15 grams of dispersion p^r minute- The spray pattern was controlled to give a good mist of polymer droplets.<br>
At the same time, through a very slightly reduced pressure, a stream of warm air of about 40 degrees C was passed through the coating chamber to remove the water vapor from the polymer mist (or small droplets), before and after they reached the tablet surface.<br>
With time, the polymer gradually formed a layer of coating on the tablet. After all polymer dispersion was sprayed to reach the desired thickness of coating, the ■resulting coated tablets were allowed to stay on the rotating pan for a few more minutes, then were decanted from the pan into container for storage.<br>
