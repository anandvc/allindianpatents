(See section 10, rule 13)<br><br>
"<br><br>
TRAFFIC POLICING<br><br>
"<br><br><br>
ERICSSON AB, S-16480 Stockholm, Sweden.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
WO 2007/060191<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/068798<br><br><br>
This invention relates to a packet transport method and apparatus for traffic policing. 5<br>
Telecommunication networks carrying multiple different services, such as triple-play traffic, are necessarily required to support services with different requirements.<br>
10 A network whose nodes have traffic control functionality allows sizing of transport services with a certain flow granularity. For this purpose a service contract (or Service Level Agreement (SLA)) is established between the users of the traffic and the network operator who provides<br>
15 the transport service. One of the important aspects of the contract is the specification of the make up of the traffic that will benefit from the service and how the service itself is to be performed; this is the traffic contract (or Service Level Specification (SLS)). The traffic contract<br>
20 provides a description of the traffic that will be served (or 'traffic description' ) and a description of the transport service (or Quality of Service (QoS) specification).<br>
25 The purpose of the traffic contract in the preliminary step is to establish whether the service requirement can be met by the network, while in the delivery step that of operating an application of the served traffic contract (or 'traffic policing') depending on the description given by<br>
- 2 -<br><br>
WO 2007/060191<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/068798<br><br>
the user. Depending on the traffic contract, as long as the traffic sent in the network conforms to the description given, it has the right to the level of service required and granted. 5<br>
Traffic policing is usually configured on the input interfaces of a network and allows evaluation of the conformity of the traffic received over an interface and partitioning of a network into multiple levels of priority<br>
10 or Class of Service (CoS). In addition, traffic policing performs measurement of the traffic profile (or 'metering') and possibly marking of the traffic packets so that the subsequent dropping of the traffic not conforming .can be done on the basis of this marking.<br>
15<br>
In the most common traffic policing configurations, conforming traffic is transmitted and excess traffic is sent with decreasing priority or dropped. Users can change these  configuration  options  to  satisfy  their  network<br>
20  necessities.<br>
Traffic transport utilizing logically aggregated links is well known. For example, standard IEEE802.3-2002 defines a functionality termed Link Aggregation (LA) where a 25 logically aggregated link is made up of a number of physical links (for example, over Ethernet network links) . This functionality can be used for a number of reasons, the most important of which are a functionality simplified from the  viewpoint  of  the  upper  layers,  logical  bandwidth<br>
- 3-<br><br>
WO 2007/060191<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/068798<br><br>
increase and a greater traffic protection capability.<br>
More generally, link aggregation falls within the use of individual logical traffic entities, that is to say, the 5 use of entities which for the upper layers of the network appear as a single entity, but which in reality use different physical ports (generically M in number) which reside on different traffic cards (generically N in number) which can also be supplied on different systems not even 10  necessarily located in the same site.<br>
in the prior art under these conditions traffic policing is performed on the individual traffic cards. This has been found to be unsatisfactory, especially when it is desired to 15 observe an established QoS and/or utilize protection functionality on logically aggregated links.<br>
The general purpose of this invention is to remedy the above-mentioned shortcomings by making available a packet 20 transport method and apparatus with adaptive traffic policing more aware of the QoS and allowing realizing protection over logically aggregated links in an effective manner.<br>
25 In view of this purpose it was sought to provide in accordance with this invention a method for application of global traffic policing for a flow of packets distributed in several separate flows over several links making up a logically aggregated link in which each separate flow is<br><br><br>
WO 2007/060191<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/068798<br><br>
processed after classification by a policer of its own which applies to said flow a traffic policing algorithm exchanging information with the other policers in such a manner that the control parameters of the algorithm fit in 5 among the various policers while allowing for the control parameters of the others.<br>
Again in view of said purpose, it was sought to realized a traffic packet transport scheme in which a flow of packets 10 is distributed in several separate flows over several links that form a logically aggregated link and in which the outgoing flow from each physical link is sent to a policer of its own that processes said flow with a traffic policing algorithm in accordance with this invention. 15<br>
To clarify the explanation of the innovative principles of this invention and its advantages compared with the prior art there is described below with the aid of the annexed drawings a possible embodiment thereof by way of non-20  limiting example applying said principles. In the drawings:<br>
FIG 1 shows diagrammatically a point of arrival in a node of a logically aggregated link,<br>
25  FIG 2 shows a functional scheme of the node of FIG 1, and<br>
FIG 3 shows a graph of the recalculation time of a possible policing algorithm.<br>
- 5-<br><br>
WO 2007/060191<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/068798<br><br>
5<br>
With reference to the figures, FIG 1 shows a reference scheme 10 of this invention. This scheme shows a logically aggregated link 11 (coming from the left-hand side of the figure), with the traffic being carried by the link needing 5 to be classified and subjected to traffic policing. The logical link is made up of a plurality of mutually aggregated links 12 and connected to different physical ports which belong to different traffic cards 13 grouped in the more general case on different systems (in the example 10  two systems designated by A and B).<br>
In accordance with one aspect of this invention it is wished to provide a classifier 14 and a policer 15 on the flow arriving from the logically aggregated link. In accordance 15 with the principles of this invention it is desired that there be awareness of the QoS and protection mechanisms aware of the QoS on the logically aggregated link.<br>
There must therefore be provided a traffic policing 20 function referred to the aggregated link 11 as a whole. But in reality each of the physical links forming the aggregated link arrives at its own separate interface port on a different card and it is therefore not possible to really realize a policer dealing with the logically 25  aggregated link as a whole.<br>
FIG 2 shows the functional scheme applying the principles of this invention to obtain a distributed traffic policing on  the  cards.  In  accordance  with  this  invention,  the<br>
- 6-<br><br>
WO 2007/060191<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/068798<br><br>
traffic policing is performed by the network processors on different cards. Each of the input links 12 reaches its respective interface 16 and the flows are then sent to corresponding policers 18 after being appropriately 5  classified by means of classifiers 17.<br>
The policers do not apply only rules based on local data<br>
but  exchange  information with each other  in order to<br>
realize a self-adapting distributed policer as a whole.<br>
10  This distributed policer (made up of all the policers 18<br>
with the appropriate information exchange connections 19) allows having a traffic policing that behaves like a single entity while adjusting parameters and behaviour depending on actual conditions (class of services, failure 15 conditions, number of physical gates in the aggregated link, number of different cards et cetera).<br>
FIG 2 shows for the sake of simplicity two input flows 12 and. two policers and reference  is made below to  this<br>
20 situation. But it is clear from the description given below of an application example of this invention how to apply this invention to a larger number of flows each with its own policer with information exchanges for realization of the distributed policer.<br>
25<br>
The two policers 18 are distinguished below by reference letters a and b.<br>
The_ policing algorithm selected is for example the known<br>

PCT/EP2006/068798<br><br>
Two Rate Three Color Marker. This is described by Internet RFC4115, available from http://www.ietf.org/rfc.html. In such a system, two leaky buckets are simulated. One bucket fills with "tokens" at a "committed information rate" (CIR) 5 and the other at an "excess information rate" (EIR) . The buckets each hold a limited number of tokens; in the case of the CIR bucket, this is the "committed burst size" (CBS) and for the EIR bucket the "excess burst size" limit. The buckets start full (i.e. with CBS/EBS tokens) but cannot 10 hold more than their limits; no further tokens will be added over the relevant limit. Each of the EIR, CIR, EBS and CBS can be set for a given flow as desired.<br>
Every time a packet is received, the size of the packet is<br>
15  determined and compared against the number of tokens in the<br>
buckets.  In one implementation, if the packet size in bytes<br>
B is less than the number of tokens in the CIR bucket, then<br>
the packet is labelled green and B tokens are taken from the<br>
CIR bucket.   If not, then B is compared to the number of<br>
20  tokens in the EIR bucket; if B is less than this number, the<br>
packet is labelled yellow and B tokens are taken from the<br>
EIR bucket.   If neither bucket has sufficient tokens, then<br>
the packet is labelled red.   Green packets are generally<br>
considered to comply with the user's bandwidth level, whilst<br>
25  yellow and red indicate increasing contravention;  packets<br>
labelled such may be subject to delay or being dropped.<br>
In  the  general  case  considered,  the  traffic  parameters associated with the policer and derived from the SLS are<br><br><br>
WO 2007/060191<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/068798<br><br>
indicated here by pl=CIR, p2=EIR, 8l=CBS, 82=EBS. In accordance with this algorithm, a flow of packets is measured and the various packets are marked green, yellow or red  depending  on  whether  they  conform or  not  to  the<br>
5 bandwidth profile established by the SLS. However, in the case of a logical link, the flow is divided over the various aggregated physical links and the packets should therefore be marked in accordance with said rule while allowing for the flows over the various physical links.<br>
10<br>
The recalculation time of the algorithm is shown in FIG 3. The measured values for each integration time T are the following:<br>
MIRa=Mean Information Rate classified by the classifier 'a'<br>
15    MIRb=Mean Information Rate classified by the classifier 'b'.<br>
By exchange of the information,  weights Wa and Wb are calculated and defined thereby as: Wa=MIRa/(MIRa+MIRb) 20    Wb=MIRb/(MIRa+MIRb).<br>
For each policer there are the conditions that: δla≥MTU_size; δ2a≥MTU_size δlb≥MTU_size; δ2b≥MTU_size 25  where MTU size is the Maximum Transfer Unit Size.<br>
In the algorithm for exchange ■ of information between policers, various behaviours can be held. If a conservative initial approach towards the equipment is preferred (that<br><br><br>
WO 2007/060191<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/068798<br><br><br><br><br>
10<br><br>

is to say, to save resources at the expense of maximum<br>
performance) it will be defined as initial parameters of<br>
the policers:	v<br>
policer<br>
policer <br>
and the updating of the parameters after each integration time will be:<br>
policer 'a': pla=plxWa; p2a=p2xWa;<br>
policer 'b': plb=plxWb; p2b=p2xWb; <br>
But if an initial approach that wastes equipment but respects in any case the client's requirements, the following will be defined as initial parameters of the policers:<br>
policer 'a': pla=pl; p2a=p2;<br>
policer 'b': plb=pl; p2b=p2;  and the updating of the parameters after each integration time will be:<br>
policer 'a': pla=plxWa; p2a=p2xWa;<br>
policer 'b': plb=plxWb; p2b=p2xWb; <br>
The whole can be generalized for N policers as follows. The weight Wn for the nth policer will be:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
indicating with MIRn the MIR measured at each integration time for the nth policer (flow) and the summation being the sum of the MIR measured at each integration time for all<br><br><br>
WO 2007/060191<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/068798<br><br>
the policers.<br>
In the conservative approach, for the nth policer the initial parameters of pi, p2, 81 and 52 will be pln=pl/N, 5     (that is to say, equally<br>
distributed among the policers) while the updating of the parameters after each integration time will be <br><br><br><br>
10 In the approach regarding the client in any case, for the nth policer the initial parameters of p1, p2, δ1 and δ2 will be pln=pl, p2n=p2, S2n=S2 and 82r=82, while the updating of the parameters after each integration time will be plr=plxWn, p2n=p2xWn, <br>
15<br>
It is now clear that the preset purposes have been achieved. Basically, information is exchanged between the policers so that the control parameters for the algorithm that manages the local traffic policing of each policer<br>
20 fits in among the various policers while allowing for the control parameters of the other policers.<br>
The  information  exchange  mechanism  among  policers  is described below. 25<br>
After each integration period T (possibly reduced because of an event, as may be seen in FIG 3) each policer sends to all the other policers involved in the aggregation a message containing its own MIRn. The integration period T<br><br><br>
WO 2007/060191<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/068798<br><br>
must be as short as possible but long enough to allow sending and receiving of all the messages between one period and the next. In the case where a policer does not receive within the integration period the MIRn figure of<br>
5 one or more of the other policers involved in the aggregation, it will consider these values equal to zero (this approach, given as an example, is conservative; other approaches can be defined). The transmission of electronic messages  between  the  policers  uses  control  channels<br>
10 designed purposely and realizable either inside one apparatus or between different apparatus, channels that are not subject to further definition within the scope of the patent right claimed here.<br>
15 Said scheme adjusts to various policing algorithms as for example the known Two Rate Three Color Marker as defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) , in which case the traffic parameters become pl=PIR (Peak Information Rate),  p2=CIR  (Committed Information Rate),  5l=PBS  (Peak<br>
20  Burst  Size),  52=CBS  (Committed Burst  Size),  or  to  the<br>
algorithm as defined by the MEF (Metro Ethernet Forum), in<br>
which case the traffic parameters become pl=CIR,  p2=EIR<br>
(Excess Information Rate) , and 5l=CBS, 82=EBS (Excess Burst<br>
Size).<br>
25<br>
In this manner, the traffic policing function, which is performed by the network processors on different cards, behaves like a single entity, satisfying through information exchange in the algorithm the need to adjust<br>
-12.-<br><br>
WO 2007/060191<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/068798<br><br>
parameters and behaviour depending on the real conditions (class of services., failure conditions, number of physical gates in the aggregated link, number of different cards et cetera). There is thus awareness of the QoS and protection mechanisms aware of the QoS on the logically aggregated link.<br>
Naturally the above description of an embodiment applying the innovative principles of this invention is given by way of non-limiting example of said principles within the scope of the exclusive right claimed here. For example, as mentioned above, from the example given, application of this invention to any number of flows and policers is immediate.<br><br><br>
