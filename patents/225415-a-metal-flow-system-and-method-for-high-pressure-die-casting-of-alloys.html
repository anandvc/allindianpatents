				<td>A Metal Flow System And Method For High<br>
Pressure Die Casting Of Alloys<br>
This invention relates to an improved alloy flow system for use in the<br>
pressure casting of alloys.<br>
In a number of recent patent applications, we have disclosed inventions<br>
relating to the pressure casting of alloys, utilising what is referred to as a<br>
controlled expansion port (or CEP). Those applications include PCT/AU98/00987,<br>
relating to magnesium alloy pressure casting and PCT/01/01058, relating to<br>
aluminium alloy pressure casting. They also include the further applications<br>
PCT/AU01/00595 and PCT/AU01/01290, as well as Australian provisional<br>
applications PR7214, PR7215, PR7216, PR7217 and PR7218 each filed on<br>
23 August 2001. These further applications relate variously to the pressure<br>
casting of magnesium, aluminium and other pressure castable alloys and to<br>
devices and apparatus for use in pressure casting of those alloys.<br>
As indicated, a CEP is utilised in the inventions of the above-identified<br>
patent applications. A CEP is a relatively short part of the alloy flow path which<br>
increases in cross-sectional area, from an inlet end to an outlet end of the CEP,<br>
such that alloy flowing through the CEP has a substantially lower flow velocity at .<br>
its outlet end relative to the inlet end. The reduction in flow velocity is such that, in<br>
Its flow through the CEP, the alloy undergoes a change in its state. That is, with<br>
molten alloy received from a pressurised source of supply to the inlet end of the<br>
CEP, the reduction in flow velocity from that attained at the inlet end to that at the<br>
outlet end is such that the state of the alloy changes from the molten state at the<br>
inlet end to a semi-solid or thixotropic state at the outlet end.<br>
In its flow beyond the outlet end, and substantially throughout a die cavity<br>
with which the flow path communicates, the alloy most preferably is retained in the<br>
semi-solid or thixotropic state. With sufficiently rapid solidification of alloy in the<br>
die cavity, and back from the die cavity back to or into the CEP, a resultant<br>
casting produced is able to be characterised by a microstructure having fine,<br>
spheroidal or rounded primary particles of degenerate dendritic form in a matrix of<br>
secondary phase. With sufficiently rapid solidification back into the CEP, the alloy<br>
solidified in the CEP is able to have a similar, related microstructure, but with this<br>
exhibiting fine striations or banding extending transversely of the CEP, that is,<br>
transversely with respect to the direction of alloy flow through the CEP. The<br>
striations or banding are a reflection of intense pressure waves which are<br>
generated in the alloy In its flow through the CEP. Those pressure waves give<br>
rise to the formation of the degenerate dendritic primary particles in generating the<br>
change in state of the alloy from a molten to a semi-solid or thixotropic state. The<br>
intense pressure waves also cause alloy element separation on the basis of<br>
density, with this being made manifest by the striations or banding, but also by<br>
radial separation of elements in the primary particles such as in a somewhat<br>
decaying sinusoidal form.<br>
The use of a CEP in the inventions of the above-identified patent<br>
applications gives rise to a number of highly practical benefits. A principal one of<br>
those benefits is the microstructure detailed above. The primary particles are able<br>
to be less than 40 µm in size, such as about 10 µm or less. This fine primary<br>
phase and the fine matrix of secondary phase contributes significantly to physical<br>
properties of castings, such as tensile properties, fracture toughness and<br>
hardness.<br>
A further benefit from the use of a CEP in those inventions is that<br>
substantial cost savings are obtainable. The savings result in part from the<br>
tonnage of alloy cast, to achieve a given product weight, being substantially<br>
reduced relative to the tonnage of alloy cast for the same product weight by<br>
current practice. The runner systems of current practice are large relative to the<br>
metal flow systems of those inventions, such that the volume and hence weight of<br>
solidified metal in the feed systems used in current practice is large relative to the<br>
casting volume and weight, and thus necessitate a higher tonnage of alloy cast to<br>
achieve the same product weight. Additionally, the tonnage of alloy loss also is<br>
correspondingly reduced with the reduction in tonnage of alloy cast. Moreover,<br>
those inventions facilitate production of a given casting on a smaller machine<br>
relative to current practice. Also, for a given casting, the use of a CEP in those<br>
inventions gives rise to greater flexibility in choice of location of an inlet to a die<br>
cavity, relative to the limited choice in current practice.<br>
In general, the CEP of the inventions of the above-mentioned patent<br>
applications increases the range of shapes and sizes of castings able to be<br>
produced. This applies where die cavity fill is by direct injection in which an inlet<br>
to a die cavity is at a location from which alloy flows outwardly to peripheral<br>
regions of the die cavity. Indeed, the use of a CEP increases the opportunity to<br>
employ direct injection for many castings. However, the increased range of<br>
shapes and sizes of castings also applies where die cavity fill is by indirect or<br>
edge feed in which an inlet to a die cavity is at a location from which alloy flows<br>
across the die cavity and then peripherally, or simply flows peripherally, to achieve<br>
die cavity fill.<br>
There are circumstances in which, despite the benefits of using a CEP,<br>
difficulties can be encountered in obtaining optimum benefit of the inventions of<br>
the above-mentioned patent applications. These difficulties may be evident from<br>
a required microstructure not being attained fully throughout a casting, due for<br>
example to an insufficient back pressure to alloy flow, or insufficient cooling,<br>
resulting from the geometric form of the die cavity for some castings. Generally<br>
the difficulties are encountered with indirect or edge feeding arrangements in the<br>
production of castings which are small in size and/or are relatively thin or have<br>
relatively thin sections. With these castings, it is difficult to control alloy flow<br>
velocities within the die cavity and, due to this and the small die cavity volume, die<br>
cavity fill time tends to be very short. Also, while the small die cavity volume is<br>
small and results in relatively rapid alloy solidification within the die cavity, the<br>
relatively low ratio of that volume to the volume of alloy in the metal flow system<br>
tends to result in an insufficient rate of solidification back from the die cavity along<br>
the flow path of the flow system.<br>
The present invention is directed to providing an improved alloy flow<br>
system for use in pressure casting of alloys, such as by hot- or cold-chamber die<br>
casting machines, which at least reduces the severity of the above-mentioned<br>
difficulties. At least in preferred forms, the improved system of the present<br>
invention enables those difficulties to be substantially overcome, thereby<br>
increasing the range of castings able to be produced with optimum benefit by use<br>
of a CEP.<br>
Depending on the size and shape of a die cavity for producing a given<br>
casting, a metal flow system including a CEP in the inventions of the above-<br>
mentioned patent applications may have the outlet end of the CEP communicating<br>
directly with the die cavity. Indeed, subject to the form of a region of the die cavity<br>
with which the CEP communicates in those inventions, that region of the die<br>
cavity may define at least an outlet end portion of the length of the CEP.<br>
However, in an alternative arrangement, the flow system of those inventions<br>
communicates with the die cavity through a secondary runner such that alloy<br>
flowing beyond the outlet end of the CEP flows through the secondary runner<br>
before flowing into the die cavity. As in the case where the outlet end of the CEP<br>
opens directly to, or within, the die cavity, the secondary runner does not provide<br>
a constriction to alloy flow in the metal flow system. That is, the secondary runner<br>
has a cross-sectional area throughout its length which generally is uniform but is<br>
not less than the cross-sectional area of the outlet end of the CEP, while there is<br>
no gate or similar constriction at the outlet end of the secondary runner.<br>
The alternative form of metal flow system, in which there is a secondary<br>
runner between the outlet end of the CEP and the die cavity, usually is used in<br>
arrangements for indirect or edge feed to a die cavity. It principally is in the<br>
context of indirect or edge feed that the present invention has its application.<br>
A metal flow system according to the present invention defines a metal flow<br>
path by which alloy receivable from a pressurised source of alloy is able to flow<br>
into a die cavity. A first part of the flow path includes a runner and a CEP, with<br>
the CEP having its smaller inlet end at an outlet end of the runner. A second part<br>
of the length of the flow path, from the outlet end of the CEP to a location at which<br>
the flow path communicates with the die cavity, has a form which enables the flow<br>
velocity of the alloy to decrease progressively from the level at the outlet end of<br>
the CEP. The decrease in flow velocity is such that, at the location at which the<br>
flow path communicates with the die cavity, the alloy flow velocity is at a level<br>
significantly below that at the outlet of the CEP as to be appropriate for the size<br>
and form of the die cavity, such that the change in the alloy to a semi-solid or<br>
thixotropic state, generated by the CEP, is maintained substantially throughout<br>
filling of the die cavity and such that the alloy then is able to undergo rapid<br>
solidification in the die cavity and back along the flow path towards the CEP.<br>
Thus, the invention provides a metal flow system for high pressure die<br>
casting of alloys using a machine having a pressurised source of molten alloy and<br>
a mould defining at least one die cavity, wherein the system defines a metal flow<br>
path by which alloy received from the pressurised source is able to flow into the<br>
die cavity, wherein:<br>
(a) a first part of the length of the flow path includes a runner and a controlled<br>
expansion port (CEP) which increases in cross-sectional area, in the<br>
direction of alloy flow therethrough, from an inlet end of the CEP at an<br>
outlet end of the runner to an outlet end of the CEP; and<br>
b) a CEP exit module (CEM) which forms a second part of the length of the flow<br>
path from the outlet end of the CEP; and wherein the flow velocity of alloy<br>
received at the CEP inlet end and the increase in cross-sectional area of the CEP<br>
are such that molten alloy, received at the CEP inlet end, undergoes a reduction<br>
in flow velocity in its flow through the CEP of from 50% to 80% of the flow velocity<br>
at the inlet end of the CEP whereby the alloy is caused to change from a molten<br>
state to a semi-solid state, and wherein the CEM has a form which controls the<br>
alloy flow whereby the alloy flow velocity decreases progressively from the level at<br>
the outlet end of the CEP whereby, at the location at which the flow path<br>
communicates with the die cavity, the alloy flow velocity is at a level of from 20%<br>
to 65% of the alloy flow velocity at the outlet end of the CEP, such that the change<br>
in state generated in the CEP is maintained throughout filling of the die cavity and<br>
such that the alloy is able to undergo rapid solidification in the die cavity and back<br>
along the flow path towards the CEP.<br>
The invention also provides a method of producing alloy castings using a<br>
high pressure die casting machine having a pressurised source of molten alloy<br>
and a mould defining at least one die cavity, in which the alloy flows from the<br>
source to the die cavity along a flow path, wherein: (a) the alloy, in a first part of<br>
the flow path, is caused to flow through a controlled expansion port (CEP) which<br>
increases in cross-sectional area between inlet and outlet ends of the CEP,<br>
whereby the alloy undergoes an increase in its cross-sectional area of flow and a<br>
resultant decrease in flow velocity from the flow velocity at the inlet end, the<br>
reduction in flow velocity being from 50% to 80% of the flow velocity at the inlet<br>
end, the flow velocity at the outlet end and the reduction in flow velocity in the<br>
CEP being such as thereby to produce change in the alloy from a molten state to<br>
a semi-solid state; and (b) controlling the alloy flow in a second part of the flow<br>
path, between the first part and the die cavity, whereby the flow velocity<br>
progressively decreases from the level at the outlet end of the CEP to a flow<br>
velocity where the flow path communicates with the die cavity which is at a level<br>
of from 20% to 65% of the alloy flow velocity at the outlet of the CEP; such that<br>
the change in state produced in the CEP is maintained throughout filling of the die<br>
cavity.<br>
As indicated, the second part of the flow path decreases the alloy flow<br>
velocity below the flow velocity level at the outlet end of the CEP. The second<br>
part of the flow path is herein more briefly referred to as the "CEP exit module" or<br>
"OEM".<br>
The progressive reduction in flow velocity achieved in the CEM ensures an<br>
appropriate flow velocity at the location at which the flow path communicates with<br>
the die cavity. That flow velocity is such that, in the die cavity, the alloy is unable<br>
to revert to a significant extent, if at all, to the liquid state. In the die cavity, the<br>
flow velocity may decrease further. However, the velocity at that location is such<br>
that, even if the flow velocity tends to increase in the die cavity, whether<br>
throughout flow in the die cavity or in a localised region, the increase is unable to<br>
be to a level enabling the alloy to revert to a significant extent to a liquid state.<br>
The arrangement of the metal flow system of the invention most preferably<br>
is such that, in its flow from and beyond the CEP, the alloy maintains a<br>
substantially coherent moving front. That is, in progressing along the CEM, the<br>
front remains substantially normal to the flow direction or is able to spread so as<br>
to progress substantially tangentially to radially diverging flow directions. A<br>
substantially coherent moving front also is able to be maintained by alloy flowing<br>
throughout the die cavity. Depending on the form of the die cavity, the front may<br>
either remain substantially normal to the flow direction, or it may spread so as to<br>
progress substantially tangentially to radially diverging flow directions in<br>
progressing to remote regions of the die cavity.<br>
As indicated above, some alloy flow systems of the inventions of the<br>
above-identified patent applications have a secondary runner and, in some<br>
respects, this is similar to the CEM of the present invention. However, such<br>
secondary runner does not provide any significant reduction in alloy flow velocity<br>
below that at the outlet end of the CEP. Also, the CEM of the system of the<br>
present invention generally is of greater flow length than is necessary for a<br>
secondary runner of those inventions.<br>
The CEM in the system of the invention can take a variety of forms. In a<br>
first form, the CEM defines or comprises a channel which has a width which is<br>
substantially in excess of its depth and a transverse cross-sectional area greater<br>
than the area of the outlet of the CEP. The width of the channel may exceed Its<br>
depth by at least an order of magnitude. The channel is such that it enables alloy<br>
flowing into it from the CEP to spread in a radial fashion and thereby undergo a<br>
reduction in flow velocity. The cross-sectional area of the channel may increase<br>
in the direction of alloy flow to thereby cause a further decrease in alloy flow<br>
velocity.<br>
In that first form, the channel may be substantially flat or, if appropriate for<br>
the die cavity for a given casting, it may be curved across its width. However, it<br>
alternatively can have a saw-toothed or corrugated configuration, to define peaks<br>
and troughs across its width, somewhat similar to some forms of chill vent. The<br>
channel may increase in cross-sectional area due to one of the width and depth of<br>
the channel may be constant along its length, with the other progressively<br>
increasing, preferably uniformly. However, if required, each of the width and<br>
depth may increase in the direction of alloy flow. With a saw-tooth or corrugated<br>
form, it generally is more convenient for only the width to increase, although this<br>
form has the benefit of maximising flow length for a given spacing between the<br>
CEP outlet end and the location at which the flow path communicates with the die<br>
cavity.<br>
With the first form, in which the CEM defines a channel having a width<br>
substantially in excess of its depth, the arrangement generally is such that the<br>
alloy flow path communicates with the die cavity through an opening having a<br>
width substantially in excess of its depth. This is well suited to die cavity fill by<br>
indirect or edge feed, particularly when the die cavity is for producing a thin<br>
casting.<br>
In a second form, the CEM defines or comprises a channel having a width<br>
and depth which have dimensions of the same order, and a transverse cross-<br>
section which progressively increases in the direction of alloy flow. This form, in<br>
having a progressively increasing cross-section, also provides a required low flow<br>
velocity at the location at which the flow path communicates with the die cavity.<br>
Subject to the form of the die cavity at the location at which the flow path<br>
communicates with it, the channel of the second form of the CEM may be open at<br>
its end remote from the CEP, with the open end defining that location. However, it<br>
is preferred that the location is defined by an elongate opening extending along a<br>
side of the channel. In that preferred arrangement, the channel may extend<br>
substantially linearly from the CEP, along a side edge of the die cavity, with the<br>
elongate opening being along the side of the channel adjacent to the edge of the<br>
die cavity. However, it is preferred that the channel is curved, to facilitate it being<br>
of a suitable length, so as to provide an end portion of the channel remote from<br>
the CEP which extends along a side edge of the die cavity. Particularly with such<br>
curved form of channel, the flow path may be bifurcated, beyond the CEP in the<br>
direction of alloy flow, to provide at least two channels each having such an end<br>
portion with such elongate opening. In the bifurcated arrangement, the opening of<br>
each channel may provide communication with the die cavity at a common edge,<br>
or a respective edge, of the die cavity. Where two curved channels communicate<br>
with the die cavity at a common edge, the end of each channel remote from the<br>
CEP may terminate a short distance from each other, such that their side<br>
openings are longitudinally spaced along the common edge of the die cavity.<br>
However, in an alternative arrangement, the two channels may merge at those<br>
ends to thereby form respective arms of closed loop, in which case the openings<br>
again may be so spaced, or they may form a single elongate opening common to<br>
each arm.<br>
The progressive decrease in alloy flow velocity in the CEM of the metal<br>
flow system of the invention, and the progressive increase in cross-sectional area<br>
of that second part which causes that decrease, may be continuous. Also, the<br>
progressive decrease in velocity and increase in area may be substantially<br>
uniform, or it may be step-wise, along at least a section of the second part. The<br>
first and second forms for the CEM described above are well suited to providing a<br>
continuous decrease in velocity, produced by a continuous increase in cross-<br>
sectional area, such as along at least a major part of the length of the second<br>
part.<br>
In a third form, providing a step-wise decrease in flow velocity, the CEM<br>
includes a chamber into which alloy received from the CEP flows, with the<br>
chamber achieving a step-wise reduction in the alloy flow velocity. The CEP may<br>
communicate directly with the chamber, or communication may be by means of a<br>
channel between the CEP outlet end and the chamber. That channel has a cross-<br>
sectional area which is at least equal to that of the CEP outlet end and which may<br>
be uniform between the CEP and the chamber. However, alternatively, the<br>
channel may increase in cross-section, from the CEP to the chamber, to provide a<br>
progressive decrease in alloy flow velocity prior to the step-wise decrease<br>
achieved in the chamber.<br>
In the third form, the CEM includes channel means which provides<br>
communication between the chamber and the die cavity and which has a form at<br>
least substantially maintaining the flow velocity level attained in the chamber.<br>
That communicating channel means may be of a form similar to that of the<br>
first form of CEM described, while it may have a substantially uniform or slightly<br>
increasing cross-section. Alternatively, the channel means may comprise at least<br>
one channel, but preferably at least two channels, similar to the second form of<br>
the CEM described above except that, if required, such channel or each such<br>
channel may have a substantially uniform cross-section.<br>
The chamber of the third form can have a variety of suitable shapes. In<br>
one convenient arrangement, it may have the form of an annular disc. That<br>
arrangement is suitable for use where the communicating means is at least one<br>
channel. Where, in that arrangement, the communicating means comprises at<br>
least two channels, the channels may communicate with a common die cavity, or<br>
with a respective die cavity.<br>
The at least one channel of the communicating means of the third form of<br>
CEM may open to its die cavity at an end opening of the channel, or at an<br>
elongate side opening as described with reference to the second form.<br>
In each form of the invention, the CEM most preferably is disposed<br>
parallel to the parting plane of a mould defining the die cavity. The first part of<br>
the flow path may be similarly located, such that its runner and CEP also are<br>
parallel to that plane, with alloy received from a sprue or runner portion<br>
extending through one mould part to that plane. Alternatively, the first part of the<br>
flow path may extend through such mould part, with the outlet of the CEP at or<br>
closely adjacent to the parting plane.<br>
As indicated above, flow velocities for achieving the required change in<br>
alloy from its molten state to a semi-solid or thixotropic state Is detailed in the<br>
above-mentioned patent applications. However, for a magnesium alloy, the flow<br>
velocity at the inlet end of the CEP generally is in excess of about 60 m/s,<br>
preferably at about 140 to 165 m/s. For an aluminium alloy, the inlet end flow<br>
velocity generally is in excess of 40m/s, such as about 80 to 120 m/s. For other<br>
alloys, such as zinc and copper alloys, capable of being converted to a semi-<br>
solid or thixotropic state, the CEP inlet end flow velocity generally is similar to<br>
that for aluminium alloys, but can vary with the unique properties of individual<br>
alloys. The reduction in flow velocity to be achieved in the CEP is such as to<br>
achieve a flow velocity at the CEP outlet end which is from 50 to 80%, such as<br>
from 65 to 75% of the flow velocity at the inlet end.<br>
The reduction in flow velocity to be achieved in the CEM of the system of<br>
the invention, below the flow velocity attained at the outlet end of the CEP will<br>
vary with the size and form of castings to be produced. However, the CEM<br>
reduces the flow velocity such that the flow velocity into the or each die cavity is<br>
from 20% to 65% of the flow velocity at the outlet end of the CEP. Depending on<br>
the die cavity form, the flow velocity may be able to increase therein, in at least<br>
some regions, although it generally is preferred that the alloy flow velocity further<br>
decreases throughout the die cavity. When the flow velocity is able to increase in<br>
at least a region of the die cavity, this preferably results in an increase to not<br>
more than about 75% of the flow velocity at the outlet end of the CEP.<br>
The preceding description of the invention makes reference to a die cavity<br>
or the die cavity. However, it is to be understood that the invention Is applicable<br>
to multi-cavity moulds. In such case, the CEM defined by the system of the<br>
invention may divide or extend to provide separate flow to a common die cavity<br>
or to each of at least two die cavities. Indeed, as illustrated herein by reference<br>
to the drawings, providing such separate flow from a common CEP generally<br>
facilitates attainment of the required reduction in alloy flow velocity.<br>

now is directed to the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>

With reference to Figures 1 and 2, there is represented therein two die<br>
cavities 10 and 11, defined by fixed mould half 12 and movable mould half 13 and<br>
each for use in producing a respective casting in a high pressure casting machine<br>
(not shown). Each of die cavities 10 and 11 is arranged to receive alloy from a<br>
pressurised supply of molten alloy of the machine, with alloy passing to each<br>
cavity by a common alloy feed system 14 according to a first embodiment of the<br>
present invention. The embodiment is one in accordance with the first form of the<br>
invention as described above.<br>
The alloy feed system 14 defines an alloy flow path which has a first part<br>
defined by nozzle 16, shown in more detail in Figure 2, and a second part 18,<br>
referred to as a CEM as identified earlier herein, which extends between each<br>
cavity and across the outlet end of nozzle 16.<br>
In overall form and detail, nozzle 16 is in accordance with the invention of<br>
the above-mentioned patent application WO 02/30596. As shown in Figure 2,<br>
nozzle 16 includes an elongate annular housing 20 by which the first part of the<br>
metal flow path defines a bore comprising a runner 22 and, at the outlet end of<br>
the runner 22, a CEP 24. Housing 20 has its outlet end neatly received in an<br>
insert 26 of fixed mould half 12, while its inlet end abuts against a fitting 28 of<br>
platen 29. Around housing 20 there is an electric resistance coil 30 and, outside<br>
coil 30, a layer of insulation 32. Also, an insulating gap 34 is provided between<br>
insulation 32 and insert 26, except for a short distance at the outlet end of<br>
housing 20 where it is in metal to metal contact with insert 24, while gap 34 also<br>
extends between insulation 32 and fitting 28. As disclosed in WO 02/30596, coil<br>
30 and insulation 32 provide for control of heat energy level of housing 20 and<br>
the temperature of alloy flowing through runner 22 and CEP 24.<br>
In the arrangement of nozzle 16, runner 22 is of constant cross-section<br>
throughout its length, except for a short distance at its outlet end at which it<br>
tapers down to the cross-section of the inlet end 24a of CEP 24. From its inlet<br>
end 24a, the cross-section of CEP 24 increases uniformly to its outlet end 24b.<br>
The arrangement is such that, at the alloy flow rate set by the machine in<br>
supplying molten alloy to the inlet end 22a of runner 22, the alloy attains a<br>
suitable relatively high flow velocity at inlet end 24a, and a suitable relatively low<br>
flow vefocity at outlet end 24b, of CEP 24. The suitable flow velocities are such<br>
that intense pressure waves are generated in the alloy in CEP 24 such that the<br>
alloy undergoes a change in its state from liquid to semi-solid or thixotropic. The<br>
suitable flow velocities vary with the alloy concerned and, while they are detailed<br>
in the above-mentioned patent applications, they also are discussed later herein.<br>
In the arrangement shown, the bore of housing 20 flares over a very short<br>
end portion 35, beyond the outlet end 24b of CEP 24. This may provide a<br>
transition to the CEM 18 of the metal flow path and, like CEM 18, serves to<br>
further reduce the flow velocity of the alloy relative to its level at end 24b of CEP<br>
24.<br>
Alternatively, that flared end portion 35 may co-operate with a spreader<br>
cone, such as described with reference to Figures 3 and 4, in which case the<br>
flared end portion 35 may provide a further significant reduction in alloy flow<br>
velocity.<br>
The CEM 18 of the alloy flow path is defined by a shallow, rectangular<br>
channel 36 into the centre of which the bore of housing 20 opens. Channel 36 is<br>
defined by mould halves 12 and 13, and has its width and length dimensions<br>
parallel to the parting plane P-P between mould halves 12 and 13. Thus, channel<br>
36 is perpendicular to nozzle 16.<br>
Channel 36 provides alloy flow to each of the die cavities 10 and 11 in<br>
which the alloy flow velocity decreases below the level prevailing at outlet end 24b<br>
of CEP 24. This is achieved by the alloy spreading radially outwardly in channel<br>
36, from end 24b, as represented by the broken circles shown in Figure 1. Thus,<br>
the alloy is retained in the semi-solid or thixotropic state achieved in the CEP and,<br>
in that state, the alloy progresses on an expanding front in channel 36 which is<br>
tangential to radial directions from end 24b. The expanding flow of alloy is<br>
constrained on reaching the opposite sides of channel 36, but is divided to<br>
continue to flow at a reduced flow velocity to each of open ends 36a and 36b of<br>
channel 36 by which channel 36 communicates with die cavities 10 and 11,<br>
respectively. Over the portion of channel 36 leading to die cavity 10, the opposite<br>
sides of channel 36 are substantially parallel, such that the reduced flow velocity<br>
may be attained a short distance before open end 36a. However, for the portion<br>
of channel 36 leading to cavity 11, the opposite sides diverge in the flow direction,<br>
such that the flow velocity is able to continue to decrease to obtain the reduced<br>
flow velocity at open end 36b.<br>
Alloy flow continues to achieve filling of each die cavity 10,11. Alloy flow<br>
throughout each of cavities 10,11 is able to be at a sufficiently low flow velocity,<br>
below the flow velocity at end 24b of CEP 24, that back pressure against alloy<br>
flow is able to maintain the alloy in a semi-solid or thixotropic state. That is, even<br>
though there may be a region of either die cavity in which flow velocity may<br>
increase, such increase is not able to be sufficient to enable any significant,<br>
localised reversion of alloy back to a liquid state.<br>
The arrangement of mould halves 12,13 is such that heat energy extraction<br>
from alloy in each die cavity 10,11, on completion of cavity fill, provides rapid<br>
solidification of alloy in each cavity 10,11 and back along channel 36 to the CEP.<br>
The thin cross-section of channel 36 facilitates this. Also, heat energy extraction,<br>
principally by die half 12 and its insert 26, enables that cooling to progress back<br>
into the CEP, despite heating by coil 30, due to the metal to metal contact<br>
between housing 20 and insert 26, around end 24b of CEP 24.<br>
Figures 3 and 4 show a second embodiment of an arrangement for<br>
producing a casting, in this case using a single cavity mould of a high pressure<br>
casting machine. The second embodiment also is in accordance with the first<br>
form of the invention as described above, but utilises a saw-toothed like channel<br>
form, rather than a flat channel as in Figures 1 and 2. Parts corresponding to<br>
those of Figures 1 and 2 have the same reference numeral, plus 100. However,<br>
the mould halves are not shown, while only part of housing 120 of a nozzle 116 is<br>
illustrated;<br>
In Figures 3 and 4, the end of channel 136 of CEM 118 has a round-ended<br>
flat portion 40 with which the CEP 124 communicates. Also, as indicated above,<br>
channel 136 has a portion 42, between portion 40 and die cavity 110 which has a<br>
saw-toothed form defining peaks 42a and troughs 42b which extend transversely<br>
with respect to the direction of alloy flow through portion 42.<br>
While the movable die half is not shown, there is illustrated a spreader<br>
cone 46 of that half. With the mould die halves clamped together, cone 46 is<br>
received within flared end portion 135 of the bore of nozzle housing 120, beyond<br>
the outlet end 124b of CEP 124. Thus, semi-solid or thixotropic alloy flowing from<br>
CEP 124 spreads frusto-conically prior to entering channel 136. Depending on<br>
the cone angles of portion 135 and core 46, the flow velocity of alloy entering<br>
channel 136 may be the same as, or slightly different from that attained at outlet<br>
end 124b of CEP 124, although it usually will be substantially unchanged.<br>
Within channel 136, the alloy first spreads radially and thereby decreases<br>
in flow velocity. On flowing through portion 42 of channel 136, the flow velocity is<br>
further decreased through to open end 136a, due to the opposite sides of channel<br>
136 diverging to end 136a. Thus, alloy flowing into and filling die cavity 110 is<br>
able to be maintained in a semi-solid or thixotropic state. The saw-toothed like<br>
configuration (with one or more than one tooth) of portion 42 of channel 136<br>
increases the back-pressure, thereby assisting in maintaining the alloy in that<br>
state. Apart from the differences detailed, overall performance with the<br>
arrangement of Figures 3 and 4 is substantially as described with reference to<br>
Figures 1 and 2.<br>
Figure 5 shows a first variant of the embodiment of Figures 3 and 4. The<br>
variant of Figure 5 is the same in overall form to that of Figures 3 and 4, except<br>
that the outlet end 124b of CEP 124 communicates directly with channel 136.<br>
That is, there is no flared portion for the bore of housing 120, and a spreader cone<br>
therefore is not required.<br>
The partial view of Figure 6 (in which the die cavity is not shown) illustrates<br>
a second variant of the embodiment of Figures 3 and 4. The variant of Figure 6 is<br>
the same in overall form as Figures 3 and 4, except that portion 42 of the channel<br>
136 of the CEM 118 is of an undulating or corrugated configuration, rather than<br>
saw-toothed. However, that configuration of Figure 6 again provides suitable<br>
back-pressure.<br>
The third embodiment of Figures 7 and 8 also is in accordance with the first<br>
form of the invention as described above. In the arrangement of Figures 7 and 8,<br>
parts corresponding to those of Figures 1 and 2 have the same reference<br>
numeral, plus 200.<br>
As with the embodiment of Figures 3 and 4, the third embodiment of<br>
Figures 7 and 8 is for producing a casting using a single cavity mould. However,<br>
in this case, channel 236 of the CEM 118 does not include a portion of saw-<br>
toothed configuration. Rather, channel 236 has flat top and bottom main<br>
surfaces. Also, while those surfaces converge slightly in the direction of alloy flow<br>
therethrough, to outlet end 236a and cavity 210, the opposite sides of channel<br>
236 diverge in that direction. The arrangement is such that, in the flow direction,<br>
channel 236 increases in transverse cross-sectional area towards the elongate,<br>
thin open end 236a, such that alloy flow velocity progressively decreases to a<br>
suitable level below that at outlet end 224b of CEP 224.<br>
In the embodiment of Figures 7 and 8, runner 222 and CEP 224 extend<br>
parallel to the parting plane P-P between mould halves 212,213, and provide<br>
communication with the end of channel 236 remote from die cavity 210. The<br>
runner 222 and CEP 224 are defined by the halves 212,213, rather than by a<br>
nozzle, while they are aligned with a centre-line of channel 236 of the CEM 218<br>
and cavity 210. The supply of molten alloy to the inlet end of runner 222 may be<br>
via a main runner or the bore of a nozzle, with such main runner or nozzle bore<br>
not including a CEP, and extending through fixed mould half 212, such as<br>
perpendicularly with respect to plane P-P.<br>
Within channel 236, there is an arcuate wall 50 which extends between the<br>
top and bottom main surfaces of channel 236. Wall 50 defines a recess 52 which<br>
opens towards the outlet end 224b of CEP 224, such that any solid slug or the like<br>
from a previous casting cycle, carried into chamber 236 with the alloy, is able to<br>
be captured and retained.<br>
Operation with the embodiment of Figures 7 and 9 generally will be<br>
appreciated from description in respect of Figures 1 and 2, and of Figures 3 and<br>
4.<br>
The fourth embodiment of Figures 9 and 10 is similar in many respects to<br>
the first embodiment of Figures 1 and 2. Figures 9 and 10 also are in accordance<br>
with the first form of the invention as described above, and the parts<br>
corresponding to those of Figures 1 and 2 have the same reference numeral, plus<br>
300.<br>
In the embodiment of Figures 8 and 9, the arrangement again provides for<br>
the production of castings, using a high pressure casting machine. The machine<br>
has a mould which defines two die cavities 310,311 between its mould halves<br>
312,313. The die halves also define an elongate channel 336 which extends<br>
between cavities 310,311, parallel to the parting plane P-P. The channel 336<br>
forms the CEM 318 of an alloy flow path of which the first part is provided by a<br>
runner 322 and CEP 324. The runner 322 and CEP 324 are defined by the<br>
housing 320 of a nozzle mounted in the fixed mould half 312 at right angles to<br>
plane P-P. The CEP 324 communicates with channel 336 mid-way between<br>
cavities 310,311, such that the alloy is divided to flow in opposite directions to<br>
each cavity 310,311.<br>
From the outlet end 324b of CEP 324, the alloy spreads in end portion 335<br>
of the bore of housing 320 and then enters a central region 54 of channel 336. At<br>
the region 54, the depth of channel 336 is increased such that region 54 provides<br>
a circular recess which can assist in stabilising alloy flow. From region 54, the<br>
alloy is divided so as to flow in opposite directions to each open end 336a and<br>
336b of channel 336, and then into the respective die cavity 310,311.<br>
Molten alloy received into runner 322, from a pressurised source of the<br>
machine, is caused to undergo a decrease in flow velocity in CEP 324, from that<br>
attained at end 324a, to that attained at end 324b, of CEP 324. The decrease Is<br>
such that the alloy state is changed from molten to semi-solid or thixotropic. The<br>
remainder of the alloy flow path Is such that the flow velocity is further decreased<br>
through to respective open ends 336a,336b of channel 336. This further<br>
decrease results from the alloy spreading radially from the outlet end of housing<br>
320, in region 54, to the extent permitted by the opposite sides of channel 336.<br>
The alloy then flows along channel 336, to each of the opposite ends 336a and<br>
336b, in which the flow velocity continues to decrease due to the opposite sides<br>
diverging slightly from region 54 to the opposite ends 336a, 336b. Finally, as<br>
channel 336 Is inclined at an angle to the end of each die cavity 310,311 at which<br>
open ends 336a and 336b, respectively, provide communication, the ends 336a<br>
and 336b have a greater area than transverse cross-sections normal to the<br>
longitudinal extent of channel 336, thereby enabling a further reduction in alloy<br>
flow velocity at ends 336a and 336b.<br>
The arrangement is such that alloy passing through open ends 336a and<br>
336b has a flow velocity which is substantially lower than the flow velocity at the<br>
outlet end 324b of CEP 324. The substantially lower flow velocity is such as to<br>
maintain the alloy in the semi-solid or thixotropic state, and to facilitate<br>
maintenance of that state during filling of die cavities 310,311. The arrangement<br>
also facilitates rapid solidification of alloy in cavities 310,311, on completion of die<br>
fill, such that solidification is able to proceed rapidly back from cavities 310,311,<br>
along channel 336 and into CEP 324.<br>
In one working example in accordance with Figure 9, utilising a 12 mm long<br>
CEP, the cross-sectional area of the CEP increased by 30% from its inlet end<br>
324a to its outlet end 324b. This increase achieved corresponding reduction in<br>
flow velocity, and a change in the alloy from a molten state at end 324a to a semi-<br>
solid or thixotropic state at end 324b. In that working example, the combined area<br>
of open ends 336a,336b of channel 336 was about 45% greater than the area at<br>
CEP outlet end 324b, resulting in a corresponding further reduction in flow velocity<br>
at ends 336a,336b. In this regard, it will be appreciated that while each open end<br>
336a,336b has an area less than that at CEP end 324b, each open end<br>
336a,336b accommodated approximately half of the total alloy flow (as in the case<br>
of ends 36a,36b of the arrangement of Figures 1 and 2).<br>
In the working example, the open ends 336a,336b had a width of 30 mm<br>
and a depth of 0.9 mm. The die cavity 310 had a 2 mm depth dimension normal<br>
to the plane P-P, while the cavity 311 had a corresponding dimension of 1 mm. In<br>
each die cavity, the alloy was able to flow on a front, to achieve die cavity fill,<br>
which spreads as it moved away from the respective open end 336a,336b. Thus,<br>
alloy flow velocity further decreased in each cavity 310,311, offsetting any<br>
tendency for the alloy to revert to a liquid state.<br>
In the arrangement of Figures 9 and 10, the inclination of open ends<br>
336a,336b is such as to direct alloy across a corner of the respective cavity<br>
310,311, and this is found to be beneficial. This inclination has been found to<br>
increase back-pressure against alloy flow, which assists in maintaining the alloy in<br>
a semi-solid or thixotropic state. Also, adjacent to end 336b, channel 336 was<br>
provided with a short length 336c which was inclined with respect to plane P-P,<br>
with this also assisting maintenance of a suitable back-pressure.<br>
Figures 11 and 12 illustrate a fifth embodiment of the invention which is in<br>
accordance with the second form of the invention described above. In Figures 11<br>
and 12, the alloy flow system shown has an alloy flow path which extends parallel<br>
to the parting plane P-P between fix mould half 60 and movable mould half 61, to<br>
die cavity 62. The flow path includes a runner 63 in line with a CEP 64 which<br>
together define a first part of the flow path. The second part of the flow path<br>
comprises a CEM in the form of a channel 66 which has oppositely facing C-<br>
shaped arms 67,68. Only part of arm 67 is shown, although it is of the same form<br>
as arm 68, but oppositely facing.<br>
Each arm 67,68 of CEM channel 66 has a respective first portion 67a,68a<br>
which extends laterally outwardly from an enlargement 69 at the outlet end 64b of<br>
CEP 64. From the outer end of portion 68a, arm 68 has a second portion 68b<br>
which extends in the same direction as, but away from, CEP 64. Beyond portion<br>
68b, arm 68 has a third portion 68c which extends laterally inwardly towards a<br>
continuation of the line of CEP 64. While not shown, arm 67 also has respective<br>
second and third portions, beyond portion 67a, which correspond to portions 68b<br>
and 68c of arm 68. Each arm 67,68 provides communication with the die cavity<br>
62, within a U-shaped recess 72 at an end of cavity 62.<br>
Runner 63, CEP 64 and channel 66 are of bi-laterally symmetrical<br>
trapezoidal form in transverse cross-section, as shown for portion 67a of arm 67<br>
in Figure 12. Runner 63 is of uniform cross-sectional area over the major part of<br>
its length but, adjacent to its outlet end, it tapers down to the area at the inlet end<br>
64a of CEP 64. From end 64a, CEP 64 increases in cross-sectional area to its<br>
outlet end 64b. From the enlargement 69 of the flow path, each arm 67,68 of<br>
channel 66 increases in cross-sectional area to a maximum adjacent to its remote<br>
end.<br>
A working example was based on Figures 11 and 12, and used for<br>
production of magnesium alloy castings on a hot chamber pressure die casting<br>
machine with a single die cavity mould. The arrangement was such that molten<br>
magnesium alloy from the machine source was supplied under pressure to the<br>
inlet end of runner 63 in which the flow velocity was 50 m/sec. At the tapered<br>
outlet end of the runner, the flow velocity was increased to attain 150 m/s at the<br>
inlet end 64a of CEP 64. From end 64a, the flow velocity in CEP 64 decreased to<br>
a level of 112.5 m/s at outlet end 64b. From enlargement 69, the alloy divided<br>
equally for flow along each arm. Relative to the locations A to E shown for arm<br>
68, the alloy flow velocity decreased progressively to 90 m/sec at A, 80 m/sec at<br>
B, 70 m/sec at C, 60 m/sec at D, and 50 m/sec at E.<br>
Each arm was provided with an elongate opening by which it was in<br>
communication with the die cavity 62. Relative to the locations C,D,E and the end<br>
of arm 68, the opening for arm 68 (and similarly for arm 67) had an average width<br>
of 0.5 mm from C to D, of 0.6 mm from D to E and of 0.8 mm from E to the end.<br>
The overall length of each slot was 35.85 mm, with the overall flow velocity<br>
therethrough decreasing from 70 m/sec at C to less than 50 m/s at the end of<br>
each arm beyond E.<br>
In the production of each casting, the alloy state changed from molten in<br>
the runner 63, to semi-solid or thixotropic in the CEP 64. That change was<br>
retained throughout flow along channel 66 and throughout the die cavity fill. The<br>
castings were of exceptional quality and microstructure, resulting from<br>
maintenance of the alloy in a semi-solid or thixotropic state, and rapid<br>
solidification in the die cavity and then back along the channel 66 into CEP 64.<br>
Figure 13 shows a variant on the arrangement of Figures 11 and 12, and<br>
corresponding parts have the same reference numerals, plus 100. Figure 13<br>
shows a main runner 70 by which alloy is supplied to runner 163. In this instance,<br>
arms 167,168 of CEM channel 166 each communicate with the die cavity along a<br>
straight end of the cavity. The CEP 164, for use with a magnesium alloy, provides<br>
for a reduction in flow velocity of 150 m/sec at inlet end 164a to 112 m/sec at<br>
outlet end 164b. In each arm of channel 166, the flow velocity decreases further<br>
to 95 m/sec at A, 85 m/sec at B, 75 m/sec at C and 65 m/sec at the end of each<br>
arm 167,168. The opening from each arm to the die cavity is from just before<br>
each location D to the end of each arm. Operation with this arrangement is as<br>
described for Figures 11 and 12.<br>
Figures 14 and 15 show more precise detaii for the variant of Figure 13, for<br>
the CEP 164 and channel CEM 166. For this, suitable cross-sectional areas for a<br>
magnesium-alloy and flow velocities as detailed in relation to Figure 13 are as<br>
follows:<br><br>
As will be appreciated, the areas shown for locations A to D are for one arm<br>
of CEM channel 166. However, relating these to the areas for CEP 164 needs to<br>
take into account the fact that each arm provides for the flow of only half of the<br>
alloy flowing through the CEP.<br>
Figure 16 shows part of the flow system for a further embodiment of the<br>
present invention, viewed perpendicularly of a parting plane. Figures 17 and 18<br>
show alternatives for the arrangement of Figure 16.<br>
In Figures 16 to 18, the runner by which molten alloy flows to the CEP 80 Is<br>
not shown. However, it and CEP 80 form the first part of the flow path of the flow<br>
system, while channel 82, chamber 84 and channels 86 form the second part or<br>
CEM of the flow system. Alloy, after undergoing a change of state to semi-solid or<br>
thixotropic in CEP 80 flows to channel 82, into chamber 84, and then through<br>
each channel 86 to a single or respective die cavity (not shown). Channel 82 has<br>
a larger cross-sectional area than the outlet end of CEP 80, and the cross-<br>
sectional may be constant or it may increase to chamber 84. In either case, it<br>
provides a lower alloy flow velocity than that attained at the outlet end of CEP 80.<br>
In chamber 84, the alloy flow is able to spread, resulting in a further reduction in<br>
flow velocity. From chamber 84, the alloy flow divides to extend along each<br>
channel 86 and, like channel 82, each of channels 86 provides for a further<br>
reduction of alloy flow velocity therein or therealong. Given the division of alloy<br>
flow, channels 86 may have a lesser cross-sectional area than channel 82, while<br>
still achieving a reduction in flow velocity.<br>
Chamber 84 may be thinner than channel 82 and channels 86 as shown in<br>
Figure 17, or it may be thicker as shown in Figure 18. It alternatively may be of<br>
similar thickness to the channels.<br>
Operation with the arrangement of Figures 16 to 18 generally will be<br>
understood from description with reference to preceding embodiments.<br>
Figure 19 illustrates a casting 90 produced using a further embodiment of<br>
the present invention. The casting comprises a pair of laterally adjacent tensile<br>
bars 91 joined in series at adjacent ends by a tie 92 of metal which solidified in a<br>
channel providing for metal flow between respective die cavities in which the bars<br>
91 were cast. The casting 90 is illustrated in the condition in which it is released<br>
from the mould and it accordingly includes metal 93 solidified along part of the<br>
metal flow path by which alloy was supplied to the die cavities. The metal 93<br>
includes metal section 94 solidified in the CEM, and metal section 95 solidified in<br>
the CEP, of the metal flow path.<br>
To obtain the tensile bars 91, the casting 90 is cut along the junction<br>
between each end of tie 92 and the respective side of each bar 91 while metal 93<br>
is severed from the side of the tensile bar 91 to which it is attached. The shape of<br>
the severed metal 93 is shown in more detail in Figures 20 and 21. The metal 93<br>
of course has the same form as a corresponding section 96 of a metal flow<br>
system according to the present invention and further description of metal 93 in<br>
Figures 20 and 21 is with reference to metal 93 as if representing that<br>
corresponding section 96. Metal sections 94 and 95 thus are taken as<br>
respectively representing the CEM 97 and the CEP 98 of the corresponding metal<br>
flow system. To continue this representation of CEM 97 and CEP 98, an outlet<br>
end section of a runner 99, through which alloy passes to the inlet end 98a of the<br>
CEP 98, is shown in broken outline. Also the shading depicts respective mould<br>
halves 101 and 102 which are separable on parting line P-P and which define the<br>
die cavities and metal flow system.<br>
As can be seen from Figures 20 and 21, the CEM 97 has an overall<br>
rectangular form, with the runner 99 and CEP 98 longitudinally in-line. The outlet<br>
end 98b of the CEP 98 communicates with the CEM 97 at the middle of one end<br>
of the CEM. Thus, the alloy flows In the direction of runner 99 and CEP 98,<br>
through the CEM 97 towards its end remote from the CEP outlet 98b. However,<br>
towards that remote end, the CEM 97 opens laterally to a short secondary runner<br>
100 through which alloy is able to pass to the first of in-series die cavities in which<br>
tensile bars 91 are cast.<br>
Along a first part of its length from CEP outlet 98b, the CEM 97 is of a form<br>
which generates resistance to alloy flow therethrough. This is achieved by<br>
alternate ribs 101a and 102a, defined by the respective mould parts, which extend<br>
laterally with respect to alloy flow through the CEM 97, and which protrude into<br>
the general rectangular form of the CEM. The width of the CEM 97 and the<br>
minimum distance A between successive ribs is calculated so that a required flow<br>
velocity for a given alloy is achieved. Thus, for example, a magnesium alloy<br>
which changes state from liquid to semi-solid in its flow through CEP 98 by being<br>
reduced in flow velocity from 150 m/s at inlet 98a to 100 m/s at outlet 98b, is able<br>
to be further reduced in flow velocity in its flow through CEM 97 whereby the alloy<br>
is retained in its semi-solid state throughout the die cavities even if increasing in<br>
flow velocity to a degree during that flow.<br>
With a metal flow system of the form shown in Figures 20 and 21, tensile<br>
test bars 91 as shown in Figure 19 were able to be produced, with the<br>
microstructure in the gauge length and the gripping ends of each bar 91 showing<br>
retention of a uniform fine microstructure indicative of rapid solidification of semi-<br>
solid alloy. Moreover, the first bar 91 was found to be substantially free of<br>
porosity, while the second bar 91 also was substantially free of porosity except for<br>
an acceptable degree of porosity in its last to fill, gripping end. This is in marked<br>
contrast to results obtainable with conventional pressure die casting, using flow<br>
from one end in producing tensile bars. With that conventional casting,<br>
unsatisfactory die cavity fill at the remote end of the first die cavity usually is<br>
experienced, while producing two tensile bars in series essentially is not practical.<br>
As indicated above, flow velocities for achieving the required change in<br>
alloy from its molten state to a semi-solid or thixotropic state depends on the alloy<br>
to be used. For a magnesium alloy, the flow velocity at the inlet end of the CEP<br>
generally is in excess of about 60 m/s, preferably at about 140 to 165 m/s. For an<br>
aluminium alloy, the inlet end flow velocity generally is in excess of 40 m/s, such<br>
as about 80 to 120 m/s. For other alloys, such as zinc and copper alloys, capable<br>
of being converted to a semi-solid or thixotropic state, the CEP inlet end flow<br>
velocity generally is similar to that for aluminium alloys, but can vary with unique<br>
properties of individual alloys. The reduction in flow velocity to be achieved in the<br>
CEP is such as to achieve a flow velocity at the CEP outlet end which is from<br>
about 50 to 80%, such as from 65 to 75% of the flow velocity at the inlet end.<br>
The further reduction in flow velocity obtained in the CEM of the system of the<br>
invention, i. e. between the outlet end of the CEP and the inlet to the or each die<br>
cavity ranges from 20 to 65% of the flow velocity at the outlet end of the CEP.<br>
The arrangement preferably is such that an increase in flow velocity in the<br>
or each die cavity, if any, during flow throughout the or each die cavity is to a<br>
level not exceeding about 75% of the flow velocity at the outlet end of the CEP.<br>
Finally, it is to be understood that various alterations, modifications and/or<br>
additions may be introduced into the constructions and arrangements of parts<br>
previously described without departing from the ambit of the invention.<br>

A metal flow system, for high pressure die casting of alloys using a machine having a pressurised source of molten<br>
alloy and a mould defining at least one die cavity, defines a metal flow path by which alloy received from the pressurised source is<br>
able to flow into the die cavity. A first part of the length of the flow path includes a runner and a controlled expansion port (CEP)<br>
which increases in cross-sectional area, in the direction of alloy flow, from an inlet end of the CEP at an outlet end of the runner to an<br>
outlet end of the CEP. A CEP exit module (CEM) forms a second part of the length of the flow path from the outlet end of the CEP.<br>
The increase in cross-sectional area of the CEP is such that molten alloy, received at the CEP inlet end at a sufficient flow velocity,<br>
undergoes a reduction in flow velocity in its flow through the CEP whereby the alloy is caused to change from a molten state to a<br>
semi-solid state. The CEM has a form which controls the alloy flow whereby the alloy flow velocity decreases progressively from<br>
the level at the outlet end of the CEP whereby, at the location at which the flow path communicates with the die cavity, the alloy flow<br>
velocity is at a level significantly below the level at the outlet end of the CEP. The change in state generated in the CEP is able to be<br>
maintained substantially throughout filling of the die cavity and such that the alloy is able to undergo rapid solidification in the die<br>
cavity and back along the flow path towards the CEP.</td>
