HETEROCYCLIC COMPOUNDS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to hydroxamate compounds that are inhibitors of<br>
histone deacetylase (HDAC). More particularly, the present invention relates to<br>
heterocyclic compounds and methods for their preparation. These compounds may be<br>
useful as medicaments for the treatment of proliferative disorders as well as other<br>
diseases involving, relating to or associated with enzymes having histone deacetylase<br>
(HDAC) activities.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Local chromatin architecture is generally recognized as an important factor in the<br>
regulation of gene expression. The architecture of chromatin, a protein-DNA complex, is<br>
strongly influenced by post-translational modifications of the histones Which are the<br>
protein components. Reversible acetylation of histones is a key component in the<br>
regulation of gene expression by altering the accessibility of transcription factors to DNA.<br>
In general, increased levels of histone acetylation are associated with increased<br>
transcriptional activity, whereas decreased levels of acetylation are associated with<br>
repression of gene expression [Wadem P.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 10, 693-698 (2001), De<br>
Ruijter A.J.M. et al, Biochem. J., 370, 737-749 (2003)]. In normal celis, histone<br>
deacetylases (HDACs) and histone acetyltransferase together control the level of<br>
acetylation of histones to maintain a balance. Inhibition of HDACs results in the<br>
accumulation of acetylated histones, which results in a variety of cell type dependent<br>
cellular responses, such as apoptosis, necrosis, differentiation, cell survival, inhibition of<br>
proliferation and cytostasis.<br>
[0003] Inhibitors of HDAC have been studied for their therapeutic effects on cancer<br>
cells. For example, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) is a potent inducer of<br>
differentiation and/or apoptosis in murine erythroleukemia, bladder, and myeloma cell<br>
lines [Richon V.M. et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 93: 5705-5708 (1996), Richon V.M. et<br>
al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 95: 3003-3007 (1998)]. SAHA has been shown to<br>
suppress the growth of prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo [Butler L.M. et al, Cancer<br>
Res. 60, 5165-5170 (2000)]. Other inhibitors of HDAC that have been widely studied for<br>
their anti-cancer activities are trichostatin A (TSA) and trapoxin B [Yoshida M. et al, J.<br>
Biol. Chem., 265, 17174 (1990), Kijima M. et al, J. Biol. Chem., 268, 22429 (1993)].<br>
Trichostatin A is a reversible inhibitor of mammalian HDAC. Trapoxin B is a cyclic<br>
tetrapeptide, which is an irreversible inhibitor of mammalian HDAC. However, due to the<br><br>
WO 2007/030080	PCT/SG2006/000217<br>
2<br>
in vivo instability of these compounds they are less desirable as anti-cancer drugs.<br>
Recently, other small molecule HDAC inhibitors have become available for clinical<br>
evaluation [US6,552,065]. Additional HDAC inhibiting compounds have been reported in<br>
the literature [Bouchain G. et al, J. Med. Chem., 46, 820-830 (2003)] and patents [WO<br>
03/066579A2]. The in vivo activity of such inhibitors can be directly monitored by their<br>
ability to increase the amount of acetylated histones in the biological sample. HDAC<br>
inhibitors have been reported to interfere with neurodegenerative processes, for instance,<br>
HDAC inhibitors arrest polyglutamine-dependent neurodegeneration [Nature, 413(6857):<br>
739-43, 18 October, 2001]. In addition, HDAC inhibitors have also been known to inhibit<br>
production of cytokines such as TNF, IFN, IL-1 which are known to be implicated in<br>
inflammatory diseases and/or immune system disorders. [J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265(18):<br>
10232-10237; Science, 1998; 281: 1001-1005; Dinarello C.A. and Moldawer L.L.<br>
Proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines in rheumatoid arthritis, A primer for<br>
clinicians, 3rd Edition, Amgen Inc., 2002].<br>
[0004] Nevertheless, there is still a need to provide further HDAC inhibitors that would<br>
be expected to have useful, improved pharmaceutical properties in the treatment of<br>
diseases such as cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, disorders involving angiogenesis<br>
and inflammatory and/or immune system disorders. With a view to meeting this need a<br>
number of small organic moiety scaffolds have been investigated including a number of<br>
heterocyclic systems, especially bicyclic heterocyclic ring systems. One heterocyclic<br>
system that has been investigated has been the benzimidazole ring system. We have<br>
now found that judicious selection of the substituents on the 5 membered ring of the<br>
benzimidazole ring system leads to the production of a family of compounds with<br>
improved pharmacokinetic properties when compared with the compounds of the prior art.<br>
The compounds within the family exhibit microsomal stability and thereby demonstrate<br>
improved half lives in the plasma when compared to the compounds of the prior art. The<br>
compounds within the family typically provide a longer duration of action due to the<br>
increased in vivo exposure (i.e., area under the curve, AUC0.iast) thereby yielding improved<br>
tumor growth inhibition profiles in the xenograft models.<br>

[0200] The compounds disclosed are hydroxamate compounds containing a<br>
hydroxamic acid type moiety in one of the substituents that may be inhibitors of<br>
deacetylases, including but not limited to inhibitors of histone deacetylases. The<br>
hydroxamate compounds may be suitable for prevention or treatment of a disorder caused<br>
by, associated with or accompanied by disruptions of cell proliferation and/or<br>
angiogenesis when used either alone or together with a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
carrier, diluent or excipient. An example of such a disorder is cancer.<br>
[0201] Administration of compounds within Formula (I) to humans can be by any of the<br>
accepted modes for enteral administration such as oral or rectal, or by parenteral<br>
administration such as subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous and intradermal routes.<br>
Injection can be bolus or via constant or intermittent infusion. The active compound is<br>
typically included in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent and in an amount<br>
sufficient to deliver to the patient a therapeutically effective dose. In various embodiments<br>
the inhibitor compound may be selectively toxic or more toxic to rapidly proliferating cells,<br>
e.g. cancerous tumors, than to normal cells.<br>
[0202] As used herein the term 'cancer' is a general term intended to encompass the<br>
vast number of conditions that are characterised by uncontrolled abnormal growth of cells.<br>
[0203] It is anticipated that the compounds of the invention will be useful in treating<br>
various cancers including but not limited to bone cancers including Ewing's sarcoma,<br>
osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma and the like, brain and CNS tumours including acoustic<br>
neuroma, neuroblastomas, glioma and other brain tumours, spinal cord tumours, breast<br>
cancers including ductal adenocarcinoma, metastatic ductal breast carcinoma, colorectal<br>
cancers, advanced colorectal adenocarcinomas, colon cancers, endocrine cancers<br>
including adenocortical carcinoma, pancreatic cancer, pituitary cancer, thyroid cancer,<br>

[0204] Exemplary cancers that may be treated by the compounds of the present invention<br>
are breast cancer, lung cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, head and neck cancer,<br>
renal cancer (e.g. renal cell carcinoma), gastric cancer, colon cancer, colorectal cancer<br>
and brain cancer.<br>
[0205] Exemplary cancers that may be treated by compounds of the present invention<br>
include but are not limited to leukemias such as erythroleukemia, acute promyelocytic<br>
leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymophocytic leukemia, acute T-cell leukemia<br>
and lymphoma such as B-cell lymphoma (e.g. Burkitt's lymphoma), cutaneous T-cell<br>
lymphoma (CTCL), and peripheral T-cell lymphoma.<br>
[0206] Exemplary cancers that may be treated by compounds of the present invention<br>
include solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. In another embodiment, preferred<br>
cancers that may be treated with the compounds of the present invention are colon<br>

[0208] In another embodiment, exemplary cancers that may be treated with the<br>
compounds of the present invention are clear cell carcinoma/mesonephroma, intestinal<br>
cancer and pancreatic cancer.<br>
[0209] The compounds may also be used in the treatment of a disorder involving,<br>
relating to or, associated with dysregulation of histone deacetylase (HDAC).<br>
[0210] There are a number of disorders that have been implicated by or known to be<br>
mediated at least in part by HDAC activity, where HDAC activity is known to play a role in<br>
triggering disease onset, or whose symptoms are known or have been shown to be<br>
alleviated by HDAC inhibitors. Disorders of this type that would be expected to be<br>
amenable to treatment with the compounds of the invention include the following but not<br>
limited to: Proliferative disorders (e.g. cancer); Neurodegenerative diseases including<br>

[0211] In using the compounds of the invention they can be administered in any form or<br>
mode which makes the compound bioavailable. One skilled in the art of preparing<br>
formulations can readily select the proper form and mode of administration depending<br>
upon the particular characteristics of the compound selected, the condition to be treated,<br>
the stage of the condition to be treated and other relevant circumstances. We refer the<br>
reader to Remingtons Pharmaceutical Sciences, 19th edition, Mack Publishing Co. (1995)<br>
for further information.<br>
[0212] The compounds of the present invention can be administered alone or in the<br>
form of a pharmaceutical composition in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
carrier, diluent or excipient. The compounds of the invention, while effective themselves,<br>
are typically formulated and administered in the form of their pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
salts as these forms are typically more stable, more easily crystallised and have increased<br>
solubility.<br>
[0213] The compounds are, however, typically used in the form of pharmaceutical<br>
compositions which are formulated depending on the desired mode of administration. As<br>
such in a further embodiment the present invention provides a pharmaceutical<br>
composition including a compound of Formula (I) and a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
carrier, diluent or excipient. The compositions are prepared in manners well known in the<br>
art.<br>
[0214] The invention in other embodiments provides a pharmaceutical pack or kit<br>
comprising one or more containers filled with one or more of the ingredients of the<br>
pharmaceutical compositions of the invention. In such a pack or kit can be found a<br>
container having a unit dosage of the agent (s). The kits can include a Composition<br>
comprising an effective agent either as concentrates (including lyophilized compositions),<br>
which can be diluted further prior to use or they can be provided at the concentration of<br>
use, where the vials may include one or more dosages. Conveniently, in the kits, single<br><br>
WO 2007/030080	PCT/SG2006/000217<br>
60<br>
dosages can be provided in sterile vials so that the physician can employ the vials directly,<br>
where the vials will have the desired amount and concentration of agent(s). Associated<br>
with such container(s) can be various written materials such as instructions for use, or a<br>
notice in the form prescribed by a governmental agency regulating the manufacture, use<br>
or sale of pharmaceuticals or biological products, which notice reflects approval by the<br>
agency of manufacture, use or sale for human administration.<br>
[0215] The compounds of the invention may be used or administered in combination<br>
with one or more additional drug (s) that are chemotherapeutic drugs or HDAC inhibitor<br>
drugs and/or procedures (e.g. surgery, radiotherapy) for the treatment of the<br>
disorder/diseases mentioned. The components can be administered in the same<br>
formulation or in separate formulations. If administered in separate formulations the<br>
compounds of the invention may be administered sequentially or simultaneously with the<br>
other drug(s).<br>
[0216] In addition to being able to be administered in combination with one or more<br>
additional drugs that include chemotherapeutic drugs or HDAC inhibitor drugs the<br>
compounds of the invention may be used in a combination therapy. When this is done the<br>
compounds are typically administered in combination with each other. Thus one or more<br>
of the compounds of the invention may be administered either simultaneously (as a<br>
combined preparation) or sequentially in order to achieve a desired effect. This is<br>
especially desirable where the therapeutic profile of each compound is different such that<br>
the combined effect of the two drugs provides an improved therapeutic result.<br>
[0217] Pharmaceutical compositions of this invention for parenteral injection comprise<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable sterile aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, dispersions,<br>
suspensions or emulsions as well as sterile powders for reconstitution into sterile<br>
injectable solutions or dispersions just prior to use. Examples of suitable aqueous and<br>
nonaqueous carriers, diluents, solvents or vehicles include water, ethanol, polyols (such<br>
as glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures<br>
thereof, vegetable oils (such as olive oil), and injectable organic esters such as ethyl<br>
oleate. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of coating materials<br>
such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of<br>
dispersions, and by the use of surfactants.<br>
[0218] These compositions may also contain adjuvants such as preservative, wetting<br>
agents, emulsifying agents, and dispersing agents. Prevention of the action of<br><br>

microorganisms may be ensured by the inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal<br>
agents, for example, paraben, chlorobutanol, phenol sorbic acid, and the like. It may also<br>
be desirable to include isotonic agents such as sugars, sodium chloride, and the like.<br>
Prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form may be brought about by the<br>
inclusion of agents that delay absorption such as aluminium monostearate and gelatin.<br>
[0219] If desired, and for more effective distribution, the compounds can be<br>
incorporated into slow release or targeted delivery systems such as polymer matrices,<br>
liposomes, and microspheres.<br>
[0220] The injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a<br>
bacterial-retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid<br>
compositions that can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable<br>
medium just prior to use.<br>
[0221] Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills,<br>
powders, and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound is mixed with at<br>
least one inert, pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier such as sodium citrate or<br>
dicalcium phosphate and/or a) fillers or extenders such as starches, lactose, sucrose,<br>
glucose, mannitol, and silicic acid, b) binders such as, for example,<br>
carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidone, sucrose, and acacia, c)<br>
humectants such as glycerol, d) disintegrating agents such as agar-agar, calcium<br>
carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates, and sodium carbonate,<br>
e) solution retarding agents such as paraffin, f) absorption accelerators such as<br>
quaternary ammonium compounds, g) wetting agents such as, for example, cetyl alcohol<br>
and glycerol monostearate, h) absorbents such as kaolin and bentonite clay, and i)<br>
lubricants such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols,<br>
sodium lauryl sulfate, and mixtures thereof. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the<br>
dosage form may also comprise buffering agents.<br>
[0222] Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and<br>
hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high<br>
molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like.<br>
[0223] The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be<br>
prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings and other coatings well known<br>
in the pharmaceutical formulating art. They may optionally contain opacifying agents and<br><br>
WO 2007/030080	PCT/SG2006/000217<br>
62<br>
can also be of a composition that they release the active ingredients) only, or<br>
preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner.<br>
Examples of embedding compositions which can be used include polymeric substances<br>
and waxes.<br>
[0224] If desired, and for more effective distribution, the compounds can be<br>
incorporated into slow release or targeted delivery systems such as polymer matrices,<br>
liposomes, and microspheres.<br>
[0225] The active compounds can also be in microencapsulated form, if appropriate,<br>
with one or more of the above-mentioned excipients.<br>
[0226] Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
emulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. In addition to the active<br>
compounds, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art<br>
such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers such as<br>
ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl<br>
benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, dimethyl formamide, oils (in particular,<br>
cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor, and sesame oils), glycerol,<br>
tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and<br>
mixtures thereof.<br>
[0227] Besides inert diluents, the oral compositions can also include adjuvants such as<br>
wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming<br>
agents.<br>
[0228] Suspensions, in addition to the active compounds, may contain suspending<br>
agents as, for example, ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol and<br>
sorbitan esters, microcrystalline cellulose, aluminium metahydroxide, bentonite, agar-<br>
agar, and tragacanth, and mixtures thereof.<br>
[0229] Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably suppositories<br>
which can be prepared by mixing the compounds of this invention with suitable non-<br>
irritating excipients or carriers such as cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol or a suppository<br>
wax which are solid at room temperature but liquid at body temperature and therefore melt<br>
in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active compound.<br><br>

63<br>
[0230] Dosage forms for topical administration of a compound of this invention include<br>
powders, patches, sprays, ointments and inhalants. The active compound is mixed under<br>
sterile conditions with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and any needed<br>
preservatives, buffers, or propellants which may be required.<br>
[0231] The term "therapeutically effective amount" or "effective amount" is an amount<br>
sufficient to effect beneficial or desired results. An effective amount can be administered<br>
in one or more administrations. An effective amount is typically sufficient to palliate,<br>
ameliorate, stabilize, reverse, slow or delay the progression of the disease state. A<br>
therapeutically effective amount can be readily determined by an attending diagnostician<br>
by the use of conventional techniques and by observing results obtained under analogous<br>
circumstances. In determining the therapeutically effective amount a number of factors<br>
are to be considered including but not limited to, the species of animal, its size, age and<br>
general health, the specific condition involved, the severity of the condition, the response<br>
of the patient to treatment, the particular compound administered, the mode of<br>
administration, the bioavailability of the preparation administered, the dose regime<br>
selected, the use of other medications and other relevant circumstances.<br>
[0232] A preferred dosage will be a range from about 0.01 to 300 mg per kilogram of<br>
body weight per day. A more preferred dosage will be in the range from 0.1 to 100 mg per<br>
kilogram of body weight per day, more preferably from 0.2 to 80 mg per kilogram of body<br>
weight per day, even more preferably 0.2 to 50 mg per kilogram of body weight per day.<br>
A suitable dose can be administered in multiple sub-doses per day.<br>
[0233] As discussed above, the compounds of the embodiments disclosed inhibit histone<br>
deacetylases. The enzymatic activity of a histone deacetylase can be measured using<br>
known methodologies [Yoshida M. et al, J. Biol. Chem., 265, 17174 (1990), J. Taunton et<br>
al, Science 1996 272: 408]. In certain embodiments, the histone deacetylase inhibitor<br>
interacts with and/or reduces the activity of more than one known histone deacetylase in<br>
the cell, which can either be from the same class of histone deacetylase or different class<br>
of histone deacetylase. In some other embodiments, the histone deacetylase inhibitor<br>
interacts and reduces the activity of predominantly one histone deacetylase, for example<br>
HDAC-1, HDAC-2, HDAC-3 or HDAC-8 which belongs to Class I HDAC enzymes [De<br>
Ruijter A.J.M. et al, Biochem. J., 370, 737-749 (2003)]. HDACs can also target non-<br>
histone substrates to regulate a variety of biological functions implicated in disease<br>
pathogenesis. These non-histone substrates include Hsp90, a-tubulin, p53, NFkb and<br>
HIF1a [Drummond et al., Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 45:495 (2004)]. Certain<br><br>
WO 2007/030080	PCT/SG2006/000217<br>
64<br>
preferred histone deacetylase inhibitors are those that interact with, and/or reduce the<br>
activity of a histone deacetylase which is involved in tumorigenesis, and these compounds<br>
may be useful for treating proliferative diseases. Examples of such cell proliferative<br>
diseases or conditions include cancer (include any metastases), psoriasis, and smooth<br>
muscle cell proliferative disorders such as restenosis. The inventive compounds may be<br>
particularly useful for treating tumors such as breast cancer, colon cancer, lung cancer,<br>
ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, head and/or neck cancer, or renal, gastric, pancreatic<br>
cancer and brain cancer as well as hematologic malignancies such as lymphomas and<br>
leukemias. In addition, the inventive compounds may be useful for treating a proliferative<br>
disease that is refractory to the treatment with other chemotherapeutics; and for treating<br>
hyperproiiferative condition such as leukemias, psoriasis and restenosis. In other<br>
embodiments, compounds of this invention can be used to treat pre-cancer conditions or<br>
hyperplasia including familial adenomatous polyposis, colonic adenomatous polyps,<br>
myeloid dysplasia, endometrial dysplasia, endometrial hyperplasia with atypia, cervical<br>
dysplasia, vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia, benign prostatic hyperplasia, papillomas of the<br>
larynx, actinic and solar keratosis, seborrheic keratosis and keratoacanthoma. In a<br>
preferred embodiment, exemplary pre-cancer conditions or hyperplasia that can be<br>
treated by compounds of this invention are familial adenomatous polyposis, colonic<br>
adenomatous polyps and myeloid dysplasia.<br>
[0234] Additionally compounds of the various embodiments disclosed herein may be<br>
useful for treating neurodegenerative diseases, and inflammatory diseases and/or<br>
immune system disorders.<br>
[0235] In one embodiment the disorder is selected from the group consisting of cancer,<br>
inflammatory diseases and/or immune system disorders (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis,<br>
systemic lupus erythematosus), angiofibroma, cardiovascular diseases, fibrotic diseases,<br>
diabetes, autoimmune diseases, chronic and acute neurodegenerative disease like<br>
Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, disruptions of nerval tissue and infectious<br>
diseases like fungal, bacterial and viral infections. In another embodiment the disorder is<br>
a proliferative disorder. In yet another embodiment, the proliferative disorder is cancer.<br>
[0236] The histone deacetylase inhibitors of the invention have significant anti-<br>
proliferative effects and promote differentiation, cell cycle arrest in the G1 or G2 phase,<br>
and induce apoptosis.<br><br>

SYNTHESIS OF DEACETYLASE INHIBITORS<br>
[0237] The present invention also provides a number of synthetic routes to synthesize the<br>
compounds of the invention.<br>
[0238] In one embodiment the method of synthesis of compounds of formula I as defined<br>
above<br><br><br><br>
[0239] includes: (a) providing a compound of the formula (A1):<br><br><br><br>
[0240] (b) protecting the carboxyl group to produce a compound of the formula (A2):<br><br>
[0241] (c) displacing the leaving group with an amine of formula R1NH2 to produce a<br>
compound of the formula (A3):<br><br>
[0242] (d) optionally reacting the compound to further functionalise R1<br><br>
WO 2007/030080	PCT/SG2006/000217<br>
66<br>
[0243] (e) reducing the nitro group;<br>
[0244] (f) reacting the reduced product with a compound of formula R2C02H or a<br>
compound of formula R2CHO and cyclising the product thus produced to produce a<br>
compound of the formula (A4):<br><br>
[0245] (g) converting the compound to a compound of formula I;<br>
[0246] wherein (d) can be carried out after any one of (c) (e) or (f) and further wherein (e)<br>
and (f) can be carried out sequentially or simultaneously.<br>
[0247] The reaction sequence employed above typically utilises a carboxyl protecting<br>
group. The term "protecting group" refers to a chemical group that exhibits the following<br>
characteristics: 1) reacts selectively with the desired functionality in good yield to give a<br>
protected substrate that is stable to the projected reactions for which protection is desired;<br>
2) is selectively removable from the protected substrate to yield the desired functionality;<br>
and 3) is removable in good yield by reagents compatible with the other functional<br>
group(s) present or generated in such projected reactions. Examples of suitable<br>
protecting groups can be found in Greene et al. (1991) Protective Groups in Organic<br>
Synthesis, 2nd Ed. (John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York). A number of well known<br>
carboxyl protecting groups may be used and the methodology chosen to attach the<br>
protecting group will depend upon the choice of protecting group to be used as would be<br>
well understood by a skilled addressee in the art. In one embodiment the protecting group<br>
is an alkyl protecting group to form the ether. These may be produced in a number of<br>
ways however it is typically found that they can be readily accessed via reaction of the<br>
free acid with an alcohol under acidic conditions. An example of a suitable alcohol for this<br>
purpose is methanol however other alcohols such as ethanol, propanol, butanol and the<br>
like may also be used.<br>
[0248] The reaction sequence detailed above also takes advantage of a suitably located<br>
leaving group on the starting material to facilitate reaction with the amine in (b). A leaving<br><br>
WO 2007/030080	PCT/SG2006/000217<br>
67<br>
group is a chemical group that is readily displaced by the desired incoming chemical<br>
moiety. Accordingly in any situation the choice of leaving group will depend upon the<br>
ability of the particular group to be displaced by the incoming chemical moiety. Suitable<br>
leaving groups are well known in the art, see for example "Advanced Organic Chemistry"<br>
Jerry March 4th Edn. pp 351-357, Oak Wick and Sons NY (1997). Examples of suitable<br>
leaving groups include, but are not limited to, halogen, alkoxy (such as ethoxy, methoxy),<br>
sulphonyloxy, optionally substituted arylsulfonyl and the like. Specific examples include<br>
chloro, iodo, bromo, fluoro, ethoxy, methoxy, methonsulphonyl, triflate and the like. It is<br>
preferred that the leaving group is either chloro or bromo. The displacement of the<br>
leaving group typically is carried out by reaction of the compound containing the leaving<br>
group with a nucleophile such as an amine which undergoes nucleophilic aromatic<br>
substitution to displace the leaving group. This typically involves reaction of the<br>
compound containing the leaving group in a non-interfering solvent with an excess of<br>
amine, The amine may vary and is typically chosen to provide the appropriate substitution<br>
pattern after displacement of the leaving group. The substitution reaction may also be<br>
catalysed by any of a number of catalysts well known in the art such as palladium, copper<br>
and the like.<br>
[0249] In some embodiments it may be desired to then further functionalise the R1 group<br>
introduced in the displacement either at this stage or at a later stage in the synthesis.<br>
This may be achieved in a number of ways depending upon the exact functionality of the<br>
R1 group introduced. For example if the R1 group contains an NH group then it may be<br>
further reacted with other agents to add additional functionality. For example it may be<br>
reacted with an acid, an acid chloride or an acid anhydride under standard conditions to<br>
introduce an amide linkage. Alternatively it may be reacted with an aldehyde under<br>
reducing conditions (reductive amination) to form an alkyl amine (via the imine).<br>
Alternatively it may be reacted with an alkylating agent such as an alkyl halide to produce<br>
the corresponding alkylated amine. The amine may also be reacted with an aryl or alkyl<br>
sulphonyl chloride to introduce an aryl or alkyl sulphonyl group onto the amine. It may<br>
also be that the amine introduced is in a protected form in which case the amine<br>
protecting group may need to be removed under standard conditions prior to the<br>
modifications discussed above being carried out. If this is done the protecting group is<br>
typically removed under standard conditions (depending upon the exact nature of the<br>
protecting group) and then reacted as discussed above.<br>
[0250] The reaction sequence also involves a reduction of the nitro group. Reduction of<br>
the nitro group may be carried out using any technique well known in the art. For example<br><br>
WO 2007/030080	PCT/SG2006/000217<br>
68<br>
it may be reduced using strong reducing agents such as LiAIH4 or NaBH4 (typically in an<br>
alcoholic solvent). It may also be achieved by reaction with triphenyl phosphine in water<br>
or by reaction with SnCI2 or Zn (typically in an alcoholic solvent or acetic acid or a<br>
combination thereof). The reduction may be conducted in any suitable solvent although it<br>
is typically conducted in a hydroxylic solvent such as methanol or ethanol in the presence<br>
of acetic acid.<br>
[0251] The process then typically involves reaction of the reduced nitro moiety with a<br>
carboxyl group or an aldehyde to produce a product which is then cyclised to produce the<br>
cyclised product. This typically involves addition of a stoichiometric amount of the<br>
carboxyl group or the aldehyde to a solution of the di-amine under suitable reaction<br>
conditions. These conditions typically induce dehydration of the reaction product such as<br>
Dean-and-Stark apparatus or the presence of a coupling agent such as DCC.<br>
[0252] The reduction of the nitro moiety to produce a reduced product and the reaction of<br>
the reduced product with a carbonyl moiety (acid or aldehyde) followed by intramolecular<br>
cyclisation may be carried out in a sequential fashion or they may be carried out<br>
simultaneously in a one-pot operation.<br>
[0253] The synthesis involves conversion of the compounds thus formed into the<br>
compounds of the invention. This may be carried out in a number of ways but is most<br>
conveniently achieved by reaction with hydroxylamine hydrochloride to produce the free<br>
hydroxamic acid. Entry to other hydroxamic acid species within the scope of the invention<br>
may be readily achieved through the use of different hydroxylamine derivatives.<br><br>
[0255] includes: (a) providing an aldehyde of the formula (B1)<br>
[0254] In another embodiment the method of synthesis of compounds of formula I as<br>
defined above<br><br>
WO 2007/030080<br><br>
PCT/SG2006/000217<br><br><br>
69<br>
[0256] (b) subjecting the aldehyde to reaction with an appropriately substituted<br>
olefination agent to produce a compound of formula (B2)<br><br>
[0257] (c) converting the compound to a compound of formula I.<br>
[0258] This sequence employs an olefination to introduce the desired functionality to the<br>
six membered ring. The olefination agent used may be any olefination agent well known<br>
in the art. In one embodiment the olefination agent is a Wittig reagent (a phosphorous<br>
ylide or phosphorane). Reagents of this type are readily accessible by reaction of a<br>
phosphonium salt with a base. In another embodiment the olefination agent is a Horner<br>
Emmons or Wadsworth Emmons reagent which is a phosphonate ylide (RO)2P(0)-CH2R<br>
which can readily be accessed via the Arbuzov reaction. In each of these instances the<br>
reaction is carried out under standard conditions. Judicious selection of the reagent<br>
allows for a wide variety of products to be accessed.<br>
[0259] As with the earlier sequence the product is then converted to the compounds of<br>
the invention using the techniques described above.<br>
[0260] The aldehyde used as the starting material in the sequence described above may<br>
be provided using any methodology well known in the art. In one embodiment the<br>
aldehyde is produced by<br>
[0261] (1) providing a compound of the formula (B3) as described above<br><br>
WO 2007/030080<br><br>
70<br><br>
PCT/SG2006/000217<br><br><br>
[0262] (2) converting the compound to the aldehyde.<br>
[0263] The compound (B5) may be converted to the aldehyde via a variety of techniques<br>
well known in the art. In one embodiment the conversion includes first reducing the<br>
protected carboxyl group to the alcohol followed by oxidation of the alcohol. The<br>
reduction of the carboxyl group may be carried out using any technique well known in the<br>
art. For example it may include treatment of the protected carboxyl group with a strong<br>
reducing agent such as DIBAL, LiAIH4, LiBH4, lithium trimethyl borohydride, BH3-SMe2 (in<br>
refluxing THF) and triethoxysilane in a non-interfering solvent. Alternatively, rather than<br>
reducing the protected carboxyl group all the way to the alcohol it may be selectively<br>
reduced directly to the aldehyde using standard conditions.<br>
[0264] Once the alcohol has been obtained it may be oxidised to the aldehyde using a<br>
number of techniques well known in the art. This may involve reaction of the alcohol with<br>
oxidants such as acid dichromate, KMn04, Br2, Mn02, ruthenium tetroxide and the like.<br>
The reaction may also be carried out by the use of Jones reagent. The conversion may<br>
also be carried out by catalytic dehydrogenation or by reaction with agents such as N-<br>
bromosuccinimide or related compounds. These oxidation conditions are typically carried<br>
out under standard conditions.<br>
[0266] (2) reducing the nitro group;<br>
[0265] The compound of formula (B5) may be provided in any way well known in the art.<br>
In one embodiment providing the compound of formula (B5) includes (1) providing a<br>
compound of formula (B4)<br><br><br>
WO 2007/030080	PCT/SG2006/000217<br>
71<br>
[0267] (3) reacting the reduced product with a compound of formula R2C02H or a<br>
compound of formula R2CHO and cyclising the product thus produced to produce (B5).<br>
[0268] The reduction of the nitro compound and the reaction of the reduced product thus<br>
produced followed by cyclisation are typically carried out using the methodologies as<br>
discussed above.<br>
[0269] Providing a compound of formula (B4) generally includes (1) providing a<br>
compound of the formula (B3):<br><br>
[0270] (2) displacing the leaving group with an amine of formula R1NH2 to produce a<br>
compound of the formula (B4): The reaction of the amine to displace the leaving group<br>
typically occurs in the presence of a base. Any suitable base may be used with examples<br>
of suitable bases including hindered tertiary amines, alkali earth metal carbonates and<br>
and any inorganic base, which is compatible with protected carboxylic group by way of<br>
example. Specific bases include sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, potassium<br>
carbonate and potassium bicarbonate.<br>
[0272] (a) providing a compound of the formula (C1)<br>
[0271] In another embodiment the invention provides a method of synthesis of<br>
compounds of formula I as defined above<br><br><br><br>
WO 2007/030080	PCT/SG2006/000217<br>
72<br>
[0273] (b) converting the compound of formula (C1) to a compound of formula (C2);<br><br>
[0274] (c) converting the compound to a compound of formula I.<br>
[0275] Conversion of the compound of formula (C1) to a compound of formula (C2) may<br>
be carried out using any of a wide range of conditions well known in the art. In general<br>
any electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction may be used to introduce the desired<br>

[0280] The agents of the various embodiments may be prepared using the reaction<br>
routes and synthesis schemes as described below, employing the techniques available in<br>
the art using starting materials that are readily available. The preparation of particular<br>
compounds of the embodiments is described in detail in the following examples, but the<br>
artisan will recognize that the chemical reactions described may be readily adapted to<br>
prepare a number of other agents of the various embodiments. For example, the<br>
synthesis of non-exemplified compounds may be successfully performed by modifications<br>
apparent to those skilled in the art, e.g. by appropriately protecting interfering groups, by<br>
changing to other suitable reagents known in the art, or by making routine modifications of<br>
reaction conditions. A list of suitable protecting groups in organic synthesis can be found<br>
in T.W. Greene's Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3rd Edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons,<br>
1991. Alternatively, other reactions disclosed herein or known in the art will be recognized<br>
as having applicabil ity for preparing other compounds of the various embodiments.<br>
[0281] Reagents useful for synthesizing compounds may be obtained or prepared<br>
according to techniques known in the art.<br>
[0282] In the examples described below, unless otherwise indicated, all temperatures in<br>
the following description are in degrees Celsius and all parts and percentages are by<br>
weight, unless indicated otherwise.<br>
[0283] Various starting materials and other reagents were purchased from commercial<br>
suppliers, such as Aldrich Chemical Company or Lancaster Synthesis Ltd., and used<br>
without further purification, unless otherwise indicated. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) and N,N-<br>
dimethylformamide (DMF) were purchased from Aldrich in SureSeal bottles and used as<br><br>

otherwise indicated.<br>
[0284] The reactions set forth below were performed under a positive pressure of<br>
nitrogen, argon or with a drying tube, at ambient temperature (unless otherwise stated), in<br>
anhydrous solvents, and the reaction flasks are fitted with rubber septa for the introduction<br>
of substrates and reagents via syringe. Glassware was oven-dried and/or heat-dried.<br>
Analytical thin-layer chromatography was performed on glass-backed silica gel 60 F 254<br>
plates (E Merck (0.25 mm)) and eluted with the appropriate solvent ratios (v/v). The<br>
reactions were assayed by TLC and terminated as judged by the consumption of starting<br>
material.<br>
[0285] The TLC plates were visualized by UV absorption or with a p-anisaldehyde spray<br>
reagent or a phosphomolybdic acid reagent (Aldrich Chemical, 20wt% in ethanol) which<br>
was activated with heat, or by staining in iodine chamber. Work-ups were typically done<br>
by doubling the reaction volume with the reaction solvent or extraction solvent and then<br>
washing with the indicated aqueous solutions using 25% by volume of the extraction<br>
volume (unless otherwise indicated). Product solutions were dried over anhydrous<br>
sodium sulfate prior to filtration, and evaporation of the solvents was under reduced<br>
pressure on a rotary evaporator and noted as solvents removed in vacuo. Flash column<br>
chromatography [Still et al, J. Org. Chem., 43, 2923 (1978)] was conducted using Silica<br>
gel 60 (Merck KGaA, 0.040-0.063 mm, 230-400 mesh ASTM) and a silica gel:crude<br>
material ratio of about 20:1 to 50:1, unless otherwise stated. Hydrogenolysis was done at<br>
the pressure indicated or at ambient pressure.<br>
[0286] NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AVANCE 400 spectrometer operating<br>
at 400 MHz for 1H NMR and 100 MHz for 13C-NMR. NMR spectra are obtained as CDCI3<br>
solutions (reported in ppm), using chloroform as the reference standard (7.26 ppm and<br>
77.14 ppm) or CD3OD (3.3 and 49.3 ppm), or DMSO-cfe (2.50 and 39.5 ppm) or an internal<br>
tetramethylsilane standard (0.00 ppm) when appropriate. Other NMR solvents were used<br>
as needed. When peak multiplicities are reported, the following abbreviations are used:<br>
s = singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet, q = quartet, m = multiplet, br = broadened, dd = doublet<br>
of doublets, dt = doublet of triplets. Coupling constants, when given, are reported in Hertz.<br>

SYNTHESIS<br>
[0290] Schemes I and II illustrate the procedures used for preparing compounds of<br>
formula lb, wherein X and Y are hydrogens, compounds (VII) of formula la can be<br>
prepared by analogous procedure, for example, by the choice of appropriate starting<br>
material. For example, in the case of Z is -CH=CH- and attached to C5-position in<br>
Formula lb, such compound(s) can be synthesized by analogous method illustrated in<br>
Scheme I and II starting with a substituted cinnamic acid (e.g. frans-3-nitro-4-chloro-<br>
cinnamic acid), appropriate amine component (R1NH2), carboxylic acid component<br>
(R2C02H, Scheme I) or aldehyde (R2CHO, Scheme II), and appropriate hydroxylamine or<br>
N-alkyl hydroxylamine (NHR3OH where R3 is defined as above in Formula la).<br>
[0291] Specifically, the hydroxamate compounds Formula lb can be synthesized by the<br>
synthetic route shown in Scheme I. The reaction of frans-4-chloro-3-nitrocinnamic acid (I)<br>
with an amine R1NH2 in the presence of a base (e.g. triethylamine) in an appropriate<br>
solvent (e.g. dioxane) gave (II). Treatment of (II) in methanol under acid catalysis (e.g.<br>
sulfuric acid) resulted in esterification providing (III). Alternatively.Jhe,carboxylic acid (I)<br>
may be esterified to the methyl ester (la) and then the chloride was replaced by the<br>
appropriate amine component R1NH2 to give compound (III). The nitro group of (III) can be<br>
reduced by appropriate reducing agent (e.g. tin (II) chloride) and the resulting<br>
phenylenediamine (IV) was coupled with an acid R2C02H to give amide (V) which was<br>
subsequently cyclized in an appropriate solvent (e.g. acetic acid) to give benzimidazole<br>
(VI) (J. Med. Chem. 2001, 44, 1516-1529). The hydroxamate compounds (VI) were<br>
obtained from methyl ester (VI) by a known synthesis method (J. Med. Chem., 2002, 45,<br>
753-757).<br><br>
WO 2007/030080	PCT/SG2006/000217<br>
76<br>
Scheme I<br><br>
[0292] Alternatively, as depicted in Scheme II, compound (VI) was prepared by reacting<br>
with an appropriate aldehyde component R2CHO in the presence of a reducing agent of<br>
nitro group (e.g. tin (II) chloride, or zinc powder) in one-pot (Tetrahedron Letters, 2000, 41,<br>
9871-9874). Formic acid was used to prepare compound (VI) when R2 = H.<br>
Scheme II<br><br>
[0293] In both Schemes I &amp; II, the benzimidazole ring may be constructed by a<br>
cyclization step involving either an aldehyde or a carboxylic acid. The following reaction<br>
steps 1-4 refer to the use of carboxylic acid for the cyclization of (IV) via (V) to form<br>
benzimidazole derivatives (VI), followed by the conversion of ester (VI) to the<br><br>
WO 2007/030080	PCT/SG2006/000217<br>
77<br>
hydroxamate (VII). For one-pot cycylization of (III) to (VI), see the procedures under<br>
Example 1.<br>
Step 1: Reduction of nitro group<br>
[0294] To a pre-stirred solution of starting material (III, 1.0 mmol) in 50 mL of co-solvent<br>
(glacial acetic acid: methanol 2:8), Tin chloride was added (5.0 mmol). The resulting<br>
solution was heated to 55°C overnight and then cooled to room temperature. The solvent<br>
was removed and the mixture was neutralized with sodium bicarbonate to pH 8. The<br>
crude product was extracted with dichloromethane (20 mL) for three times. The organic<br>
extracts were combined and washed with water (15 mL) twice and brine (15 mL) once and<br>
further dried over Na2S04 for 1 hour. It was filtered and concentrated; the diamino<br>
product (IV) was purified by flash chromatography.<br>
Step 2: Amide formation<br>
[0295] To a pre-stirred solution of carboxylic acid (1.1 mmol), diamino product (IV, 1.0<br>
mmol) and PyBOP (1.1 mmol) in 10 mL of dried dichloromethane, was added DIEA (3.0<br>
mmol) via a syringe. The resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature for 4 hours.<br>
The amide product (V) was purified by silica gel column chromatography.<br>
Step 3: Cyclization<br>
[0296] The amide product (V), obtained in Step 2, was treated with 5 mL of glacial<br>
acetic acid, the resulting solution was heated to 75°C for 24 hours. After cooling down to<br>
rt, the solvent was removed under vacuum to give product (VI) near quantitatively.<br>
Step 4: Hydroxamic acid formation<br>
[0297] To a stirred solution of ester (VI) and NH2OH«HCI (10 equiv.) in MeOH (0.5 M)<br>
was added NaOMe solution (20 equiv.) at - 78 °C. The reaction mixture was then allowed<br>
to warm up slowly to room temperature. The reaction was monitored by LC/MS and was<br>
completed in around 15-60 min. 1/V HCI was then added slowly into the reaction mixture<br>
at 0°C. The desired product was separated by reverse-phase preparative HPLC and the<br>
fractions containing the desired product were freeze-dried. The hydroxamate product (VI)<br>
was obtained as TFA salt (isolated yield varies between 40 - 70%).<br>
[0298] Scheme III illustrates another alternative procedure used for preparing<br>
compounds of formula lb, where X and Y are hydrogens and R2 is selected from the group<br>
R11S(0)R13-, R11S(0)2R13-, R11C(0)N(R12)R13-. R11S02N(R12)R13-, R11N(R12)C(0)R13-,<br>
R11N(R12)S02R13-, R11N(R12)C(0)N(R12)R13- and heteroalkyl. For example, in the case of Z<br><br>

is -CH=CH- and attached to (^-position in Formula lb, such compound(s) (XIII) can be<br>
synthesized by analogous method illustrated in Schemes I &amp; starting with appropriate<br>
(III), appropriate Fmoc protected amino acids, appropriate acid chlorides or aldehydes,<br>
and hydroxylamine.<br>
Scheme III<br><br>
[0299] More specifically, for example, the hydroxamate compounds Formula lb, where<br>
X and Y are hydrogens, R2 is selected from the group R11S(0)R13-, R11S(0)2R13-,<br>
R11C(0)N(R12)R13-, R11S02N(R12)R13-, R11N(R12)C(0)R13-, R11N(R12)S02R13-.<br>
R11N(R12)C(0)N(R12)R13- and heteroalkyl; and Z is attached to exposition, can be<br>
synthesized by the synthetic route shown in Scheme III. Appropriate intermediate (III) was<br>
reduced with tin chloride to the corresponding diamines (IV). The coupling reaction with<br><br>

79<br>
appropriate Fmoc protected amino acids in the presence of PyBOP gave coupling<br>
produces) (VIII) and/or (IX). Without further separation, (VIII) and/or (IX) were subjected to<br>
cyclization under acid conditions and yielded benzimdiazole (X). The key intermediate (XI)<br>
can be obtained by treating (X) with 20% piperidine. Treatment of (XI) with an appropriate<br>
acid chloride or an appropriate sulfonyl chloride gave (XII) and the target compounds (XIII)<br>
were obtained by using similar method described in Scheme I.<br>
[0300] When (XI) was reacted with an appropriate aldehyde under reduction conditions<br>
(NaBH(OAc)3 /CH3C02H), (XIV) was obtained and can be transformed to corresponding<br>
hydroxamate derivatives (XV) by the same methods described above.<br>
[0301] Scheme IV illustrates some reactions to further modify R1 side chain. If the R1<br>
side chain contained a protecting group such as Boc in compound (Vla1), it could be<br>
removed before converting to the final hydroxamic acid (Vila). The intermediate (Via)<br>
could be modified by acylation, reductive alkylation, alkylation or sulfonylation to form new<br>
analogs (Vllb, Vile, Vlld and Vile) through new intermediates (Vlb, Vic, Vld and Vie). The<br>
above described methods were also applied to R1 = heterocycles, e.g., R1 = N-Boc-<br>
piperidin-3-yl, /V-Boc-piperidin-4-yl and /V-Boc-pyrrolidin-3-yl.<br><br>

[0302] Scheme V illustrates some alternative method to prepare (Via) and (Vic). The<br>
primary amine (IHa2) was prepared either from (la) or via (Ills'!). The derivertization of the<br>
amino group (e.g., reductive amination) could be performed either from (Illa2) or (Vla2).<br>
The products, i.e., (Illa2-1) and (Vla2-1), could be further derivertized (e.g., reductive<br>
amination of the secondary amine).<br><br>

[0303] Scheme VI and VII illustrate some alternative methods to prepare (VI) by forming<br>
the benzimidazole ring first and introducing the double bond later.<br>
[0304] In Scheme VI, compound (XVI) was reacted with an amine R1NH2 in the<br>
presence of a base (e.g. triethylamine) in an appropriate solvent (e.g. dioxane) to give<br>
(XVII). Benzimidazole (XVIII) ring was formed by reacting compound (XVII) with aldehyde<br>
R2CHO in the presence of a reducing agent of nitro group (e.g. tin (II) chloride, zinc<br>
powder or other appropriate reducing agent) in one-pot. The ester (XVIII) was converted<br>
to the aldehyde (XX) via a reduction and oxidation process. Finally, (VI) was obtained by<br>
reacting aldehyde (XX) with a Wittig or Wittig-Horner reagent.<br><br>

(XXII). Benzimidazole (XXIII) ring was formed by reacting compound (XXII) with aldehyde<br>
R2CHO in the presence of a reducing agent of nitro group (e.g. tin (II) chloride, zinc<br>

then another portion of methyl trans-4-Chloro-3-nitrocinnamate (4.8 g, 20 mmol) and<br>
triethyl amine (5.5 mL, 40 mmol) was added, the resulting mixture was allowed to stir<br>
overnight at 100 °C, then reaction was quenched by adding 200 mL of DCM and 80 mL of<br>
1M HCI solution. After separation of DCM layer, the aqueous solution was extracted with<br>
DCM one more time, and combined with previous DCM solution, which was then washed<br>
with brine, dried over sodium sulfate, then filtered through silica gel short column, and<br>
rinsed with ethyl acetate and hexanes mixture (2:1) until the orange color band was<br>
completely rinsed down. After removal of solvent under reduced pressure, the residue 69-<br>

mixture was diluted using ethyl acetate (300 ml_) at room temperature, and was then<br>
quenched with sat. sodium carbonate (30 ml_). The resulting mixture was stirred for<br>
additional 1 hour, then organic layer was decanted to another conic flask. Solid left in<br>
reaction flask was suspension with another portion of ethyl acetate (300 mL), which was<br>
then decanted and combined with previous portion of ethyl acetate and was then filtered<br>
through silica gel short column and rinsed with ethyl acetate, after removal of filtrate under<br>
reduced pressure, the residue was pure enough for next step and also could be purified<br>
on column (hexanes:EtOAc = 1:2) to give a pale-yellow solid 69-3 (3.8 g, 44%). LC-MS<br>

BIOLOGICAL TESTING AND ENZYME ASSAYS<br>
Recombinant GST-HDAC1 Protein expression and purification<br>
[0466] Human cDNA library was prepared using cultured SW620 cells. Amplification of<br>
human HDAC1 coding region from this cDNA library was cloned separately into the<br>
baculovirus expression pQEST20 vector (GATEWAY Cloning Technology, Invitrogen Re<br>
Ltd). The pDEST20-HDAC1 construct was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Recombinant<br>
baculovirus was prepared using the Bac-To-Bac method following the manufacturer's<br>
instruction (Invitrogen Pte Ltd). Baculovirus titer was determined by plaque assay to be<br>
about 108 PFU/ml.<br>
[0467] Expression of GST-HDAC1 was done by infecting SF9 cells (Invitrogen Pte Ltd)<br>
with pDEST20-HDAC1 baculovirus at MOI=1 for 48 h. Soluble cell lysate was incubated<br>
with pre-equilibrated Glutathione Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham) at 4°C for 2 h. The<br>
beads were washed with PBS buffer for 3 times. The GST-HDAC1 protein was eluted by<br>
elution buffer containing 50 mM Tris, pH8.0, 150mM NaCI, 1% Triton X-100 and 10mM or<br>
20mM reduced Glutathione. The purified GST-HDAC1 protein was dialyzed with HDAC<br>
storage buffer containing 10mM Tris, pH7.5,100mM NaCI and 3mM MgCI2. 20% Glycerol<br>
was added to purified GST-HDAC1 protein before storage at -80°C.<br>
In vitro HDAC assay for determination of iC50 values<br>
[0468] The assay has been carried out in 96 well format and the BIOMOL fluorescent-<br>
based HDAC activity assay has been applied. The reaction composed of assay buffer,<br>
containing 25 mM Tris pH 7.5, 137 mM NaCI, 2.7 mM KCI, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mg/ml BSA,<br><br>

tested compounds, an appropriate concentration of HDAC1 enzyme, 500 uM Flur de lys<br>
generic substrate for HDAC1 enzyme and subsequently was incubated at room<br>
temperature for 2 h. Flur de lys Developer was added and the reaction was incubated for<br>
10 min. Briefly, deacetylation of the substrate sensitizes it to the developer, which then<br>
generates a fluorophore. The fluorophore is excited with 360 nm light and the emitted<br>
light (460 nm) is detected on a fluorometric plate reader (Tecan Ultra Microplate detection<br>
system, Tecan Group Ltd.).<br>
[0469] The analytical software, Prism 4.0 (GraphPad Software Inc) has been used to<br>
generate IC50 from a series of data. ICso is defined as the concentration of compound<br>
required for 50% inhibition of HDAC enzyme activity.<br>

Histone H3 acetylation assay<br>
[0476] A hallmark of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition is the increase in the<br>
acetylation level of histones. Histone acetylation, including H3, H4 and H2A can be<br>
detected by immuno-blotting (western-blot). Colo205 cells, approximately 5 x105 cells,<br>
were seeded in the previously described medium, cultivated for 24 h and subsequently<br>
treated with HDAC inhibitory agents and a positive control at a final concentration of 10<br>
uM. After 24 h, cells were harvested and lysed according to the instruction from Sigma<br>
Mammalian Cell Lysis Kit. The protein concentration was quantified using BCA method<br>
(Sigma Pte Ltd). The protein lysate was separated using 4-12% bis-tris SDS-PAGE gel<br>
(Invitrogen Re Ltd) and was transferred onto PVDF membrane (BioRad Re Ltd). The<br>
membrane was probed using primary antibody specific for acetylated histone H3 (Upstate<br>
Pte.Ltd), The detection antibody, goat anti rabbit antibody conjugated with HRP waaused<br>
according to the manufacturing instruction (Pierce Pte Ltd). After removing the detection<br>
antibody from the membrane, an enhanced chemiluminescent substrate for detection of<br>
HRP (Pierce Pte Ltd) was added onto the membrane. After removing the substrate, the<br>
membrane was exposed to an X-ray film (Kodak) for 1 sec - 20 mins. The X-ray film was<br>
developed using the X-ray film processor. The density of each band observed on the<br>
developed film could be qualitatively analyzed using UVP Bioimaging software (UVP, Inc,<br>
Upland, CA). The values were then normalized against the density of actin in the<br>
corresponding samples to obtain the expression of the protein.<br>
[0477] The results of immuno-blotting assay using acetylated histone H3 antibody are<br>
shown in Table 4 for representative compounds of this invention.<br><br>

Measurement of Microsomal stability<br>
[0480] Metabolic stability measurements in the in vitro using liver microsomes aids in the<br>
prediction of the in vivo hepatic clearance and the compound stability towards phase I<br>
biotransformation reactions mediated by P450 isozymes.<br>
[0481] Pooled human liver microsome (HLM was purchased from BD Gentest (BD<br>
BioSciences). The incubations consisted of test compound (5 uM) or control compound<br>
(Verapamil), NADPH-generating system solution A (25 mM NADP+, 66 mM glucose-6-<br>
phosphate, 66 mM MgCI2 in H20), NADPH-generating system solution B (40 U/ml<br>
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase in 5 mM sodium citrate) and 1.0 mg/ml microsomal<br>
protein, respectively, in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Samples were<br>
incubated for 0, 5, 15, 30, 45, 60min. Reaction was terminated with ice-cold 80%<br>
acetonitrile and 20% DMSO. Samples were subsequently centrifuged at 4°C for 15 min at<br>
2,000 rpm. 100 uL of the supernatant was transferred to the LC-MS Plate for analysis.<br>
Before quantitative analysis, the compound was tuned in LC/MS machine to get the<br><br>

optimized MS condition. Liquid chromatography was performed on a Luna C18 column<br>
(Phenomenex U.S.A, Torrance, CA) (2x50mm, 5 uM). % of the compound remaining (by<br>
area) at each time point is calculated with respect to time 0 min. Plot %remaining against<br>
time (min) to obtain the curve and use the Prism software to obtain the t1/2. These are<br>

[0483] The measured in vitro t1/2&gt;30 mins for the above compounds signifies that the<br>
contribution towards the clearance of the compound due to metabolism is expected to be<br>
low in the in vivo situation and thus help in yielding longer half-life and increased exposure<br>
of the compounds.<br>
[0484] The above results demonstrated the compounds of formula (I) were metabolically<br>
stable in human liver microsome assay. Together with the appropriate physicochemical<br>
properties, e.g., molecular weight, logP and high solubility, the above compounds could<br>
exhibit adequate pharmacological exposure and effect to the body when administrated<br>
intravenously or especially orally.<br>
In vivo Pharmacokinetic (PK) studies<br>
[0485] Compound was dissolved in appropriate solution (saline or DMA and Cremaphor<br>
in saline) at 1 mg/ml for intravenous (IV) administration, or in 0.5% methyl cellulose, 0.1%<br>
Tween 80 in water at 5 mg/ml for oral administration. Mice were randomized according to<br>
body weight, grouped three per time point. Mice were administered single IV dose (10<br>
mg/kg) via tail vein, or single oral dose (50 mg/kg) via gavage. At pre-defined time points<br>
(predose, 5 or 10, 30min, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24h), one group of mice was sacrificed by<br>
overdose COz and blood samples were collected by cardiac puncture. The blood samples<br>
were centrifuged immediately for 10 min at 3000 rpm to separate plasma, and plasma was<br>
kept frozen at -80 °C until analysis by LC/MS/MS. Before sample analysis, the method<br><br>
WO 2007/030080	PCT/SG2006/000217<br>

was developed for LC/MS/MS assay. The method was validated for signal-response of<br>
the calibration standards, auto-sampler stability for -15 hours intra-day and inter-day<br>
calibration curve using eight calibration standards excluding the blank plasma. QC<br>
samples at three different concentrations in triplicates were prepared to determine the<br>
accuracy and precision. The extracted QC samples were compared to unextracted<br>
samples to determine the extraction efficiency of the analyte. LLOQ was determined by<br>
using triplicate samples of 1ng/mL and 2ng/mL to obtain accuracy and precision at the low<br>
end. Samples were analysed using the validated method. Data was analyzed by the non-<br>
compartmental model using WinNolin 4.0 software (Pharsight, Mountain View, CA, USA).<br>
The mean values for the plasma compound concentration-time profiles were used in<br>
mouse PK study.<br>
[0486] The PK parameter AUC 0-iast providing the information on the overall exposure of<br>
the drug in vivo is one of the key PK/PD parameters that helps in predicting the efficacy of<br>
an anti-cancer compound. The higher the AUC value, the better will be the in vivo efficacy<br>
of the compound at similar in vitro potency. Pharmacokinetic data of selected compounds<br>
in Table 5 were shown in Table 6 below.<br>
[0487] Table 6. Representative pharmacokinetic data [compounds were in<br>
hydrochloric acid salt form (2HCI), dosed at 50 mg/kg, p.o.]<br><br>

[0488] The data in Table 6 further demonstrated that compounds with high metabolic<br>
stability as shown by representative compounds in Table 5 together with the appropriate<br>
physicochemical properties, e.g., molecular weight, logP, and high solubility, were able to<br>
yield adequate pharmacological exposure and effect in the animal when administrated<br>
orally.<br>
In vivo antineoplastic (or anti-tumor) effect of HDAC inhibiting agents:<br>
[0489] The efficacy of the compounds of the invention can then be determined using in<br>
vivo animal xenograft studies. The animal xenograft model is one of the most commonly<br>
used in vivo cancer models.<br><br>

[0490] In these studies Female athymic nude mice (Harlan), 12-14 weeks of age would<br>
be implanted subcutaneously in the flank with 5 x 106 cells of HCT116 human colon tumor<br>
cells, or with 5 x 106 cells of A2780 human ovarian tumor cells, or with 5 x 106 cells of PC3<br>
prostate cancer cells. When the tumor reaches the size 100 mm3, the xenograft nude<br>
mice would be paired-match into various treatment groups. The selected HDAC inhibitors<br>
would be dissolved in appropriate vehicles and administered to xenograft nude mice<br>
intraperitoneally, intravenously or orally daily for 14-21 days. The dosing volume will be<br>
0.01 ml/g body weight. Paclitaxol, used as positive control, will be prepared for intravenous<br>
administration in an appropriate vehicle. The dosing volume for Paclitaxol will be 0.01<br>
ml/g body weight. Tumor volume will be calculated every second day or twice-a-week of<br>
post injection using the formula: Volume (mm3) = (w2x l)/2, where w = width and I = length<br>
in mm of an HCT116, or A2780, or PC3 tumor. Compounds of this invention that are<br>
tested would show significant reduction in tumor volume relative to controls treated with<br>
vehicle only. Acetylated histone relative to vehicle treated control group when measured<br>
shall be accumulated. The result will therefore indicate that compounds of this invention<br>
are efficacious in treating a proliferative disorder/disease such as cancer.<br>
