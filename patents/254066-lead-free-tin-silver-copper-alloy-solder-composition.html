Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
FIG. 1A depicts a cross-sectional view of an electrical structure (e.g., an electronic packaging structure) 10, showing a substrate 12 in position for being soldered to a substrate 18, in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. An electrically conductive pad (l'pad") 13 is attached to the substrate 12, and a solder ball 14 is coupled to the pad 13. For example, the solder ball 14 may be in contact with the pad 13 (e.g., in metallurgical and/or electrical contact with the pad 13). Thus, the substrate 12, the pad 13, and the solder ball 14 are coupled together as a single mechanical unit. The solder ball 14 has been coupled to the pad 13 by any method <br>
* known to a person of ordinary skill in the art such as, inter alia, by reflowing the solder ball 14 onto the pad 13, followed by cooling and thus solidifying the solder ball 14. A pad 17 is attached to the substrate 18, and a solder paste 16 has been applied to the pad 17 and is in contact with the pad 17. The substrate 12 is to be soldered to the substrate 18 by heating, melting, and reflowing the solder paste 16 and the solder ball 14 such that the melted and reflowed solder from the solder paste 16 is incorporated into the solder ball 14 to form the modified solder ball 15 of FIG. IB. The modified solder ball 15 comprises the solder paste 16 as having been incorporated into the solder ball 14 during the aforementioned melting and reflowing of the solder paste 16 and the solder ball 14. After being cooled and solidified, the modified solder ball 15 serves as a solder joint that couples the substrate 12 to the substrate 18. In some embodiments, the joining of substrates 12 and 18 is performed without the use of the solder paste 16. In such embodiments, only flux is used to facilitate the joining process. In other embodiments, the solder paste 16 may be used to join substrates 12 and 18, wherein the solder ball 14 does not melt, but is wetted by the solder paste 16 solder under reflow conditions and provides for attachment upon solidification of the solder paste 16 solder. In FIG. 1A, the electrical structure 10 may be denoted as a "pre-soldering electrical structure."<br>
FIG. IB depicts a cross-sectional view of the electronic structure 10 of FIG. 1A after the substrate 12 has been soldered to the substrate 18 such that both the solder paste 16 and the solder ball 14 have been fully melted, in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. In FIG. IB, the solidified modified solder ball 15 serves as a solder joint that couples the substrate 12 to the substrate 18. The modified solder ball 15 comprises the material of the solder<br>
-ball 14 and the material of the solder paste 16 (see FIG. 1 A). Generally, N solder balls mechanically and electrically couple the substrate 12 to the substrate 18, wherein N^ 1, and wherein each of the N solder balls is typified by the modified solder ball 15. In FIG. IB, the electrical structure 10 may be denoted as a "post-soldering electrical structure."<br>
In an alternative embodiment, the solder paste 16 is not used and a flux is instead used in accordance with the present invention, using any flux material known to one of ordinary skill in the art, to couple the solder ball 14 to the pad 17. When the flux is used, the modified solder ball 15 includes essentially the material of the solder ball 14 and does not include any solder paste. In other alternative embodiments, neither flux nor the solder paste 16 is used to couple the solder ball 14 to the pad 17 in accordance with the present invention.<br>
In FIGS. 1A and IB, the substrates 12 and 18 may each comprise any electrical or electronic composite, laminate, component, etc. As a first example, the substrate 12 may comprise an integrated-circuit chip ("chip") and the substrate 18 may comprise a chip carrier (e.g., a ceramic or organic chip carrier). In chip attachment to a chip carrier, solder paste is typically not used. As a second example, the substrate 12 may comprise a chip carrier (e.g., a ceramic or organic chip carrier) and the substrate 18 may comprise a circuit card. In the second example, the solder ball 14 may be a Ball Grid Array ("BGA") solder ball. The solder pads 13 and 17 may each be any type of solder pad. and comprise any material or materials, known to one of ordinary skill in the art such as, inter alia, a copper pad, a nickel-gold plated copper pad ("nickel-gold pad"; i.e., a copper pad coated by a layer of nickel, and a layer of gold coating the layer of nickel), etc. The solder paste 16 may have any applicable composition (e.g., any <br>
applicable substantially lead-free composition) known to a person of ordinary skill in the art. For example, the solder paste 16 may comprise a solder paste composition by weight percent of: 3.5- 4.0% silver, 0.5%-0.9% copper, and the remainder as essentially tin with possible additions of small or trace amounts of other constituents. As another example, the solder paste 16 may comprise a solder paste composition by weight percent of: 3.5-4.0% silver and the remainder as essentially tin with possible additions of small or trace amounts of other constituents.<br>
For the present invention, the solder ball 14 comprises an alloy of tin (Sn), silver (Ag), and copper (Cu) having concentrations of Sn, Ag, and Cu ("SAC") that relate to commercial SAC alloy compositions and the ternary eutectic SAC alloy composition. Typically, commercial SAC alloy compositions comprise Sn-3.8Ag-0.7Cu (i.e., 3.8 weight percent Ag and 0.7 weight percent Cu) and Sn-4.0Ag-0.5Cu. Based on the best experimental information in the scientific literature, the ternary eutectic SAC alloy composition is Sn-aAg-pCu, wherein a is about 3.4 to 3.5, and wherein P is between about 0.8 to 0.9. SAC alloy compositions in this near ternary eutectic compositional range are leading lead-free candidate solders to replace the Sn-37Pb alloy that is currently and historically used in electronic component assembly processes.<br>
For notational purposes, whenever the SAC alloy is expressed herein in the form Sn-aAg- PCU, it should be understood that a denotes the weight percent concentration of Ag in the* SAC alloy and P denotes the weight percent concentration of Cu in the SAC alloy. The remainder of (100-A-P) percent of the SAC alloy, by weight, comprises essentially tin and possibly small or trace amounts of other constituents (e.g., bismuth or antimony as will be discussed m/ra). Similar notation with analogous interpretations will be used herein for other alloys than the SAC<br>
• alloy, so that a coefficient of a component of an alloy (e.g., the coefficient a or 3.4 of the component Ag of the SAC alloy) denotes the weight percent concentration of the component in the alloy.<br>
As will be demonstrated infra, the preceding SAC alloy compositions, when present in the modified solder ball 15 of FIG. IB, include Ag3Sn ("silver-tin") plates which may promote fatigue cracking during execution of thermal transients such as during thermal cycle testing simulating field application conditions. The present invention prevents such silver-tin plates from forming, or limits the size of such silver-tin plates, by synergistically exploiting the kinetics in combination with the thermodynamics of phase transformations associated with solidification of the ternary SAC alloy from the liquid state after the SAC alloy has been melted by heating and reflow (melting). The following discussion summarizes aspects of relevant phase transformations that underlie the present invention.<br>
The three phases produced upon full solidification of the liquid SAC alloy (upon cooling from a liquid state) are Sn, Ag3Sn, and Cu6Sn5. For the purposes of this discussion, the ternary eutectic SAC alloy will be used as exemplifying the general behavior of all SAC alloys in this near eutectic compositional range. Upon cooling the liquid phase from temperatures above the melting point, non-equilibrium, kinetic effects intervene to preclude the simultaneous formation of all three phases at the melting point; i.e., to preclude a true eutectic phase transformation, because the equilibrium eutectic phase transformation is kinetically inhibited. The crystalline Ag3Sn phase is easily nucleated and forms with minimal undercooling (also called "supercooling") below the eutectic melting point of 217 °C of the ternary eutectic SAC alloy. <br>
This Ag3Sn phase, which is the first solid phase to form upon cooling to and below 217 °C , has a plate-like growth morphology. These plates can grow rapidly in the surrounding liquid phase. The bulk of the liquid phase comprises Sn, and the Sn crystalline phase does not easily nucleate. The crystalline Sn phase requires substantial undercooling for nucleation from the liquid state. Undercoolings of 15 to 25 °C are typically required for the formation of the solid phase of Sn. During the time interval associated with the undercooling required for the nucleation of the crystalline Sn phase, the Ag3Sn plates can grow to a large size. In processing conditions with typical cooling rates of 0.2 to 0.3 °C/sec, this cooling time interval can comprise tens of seconds and afford sufficient time for the Ag3Sn plates to grow to a large size. If the nucleation frequency for the Ag3Sn is low to the extent that only 1 or 2 plates are formed within the modified solder ball 15 of FIG. IB, then these Ag3Sn plates can grow large enough to subtend the entire solder joint embodied by the modified solder ball 15. As will be shown infra, these Ag3Sn plates can adversely affect the thermomechanical fatigue properties of such solder joints, for both chip-to- chip carrier and chip carrier-to-circuit card solder joints. Failure analysis demonstrates that the failures are caused by strain localization at the interface between the Ag3Sn plates and the bounding solid Sn phase due to grain boundary sliding at this phase boundary. As will be shown infra, by altering the Ag concentration within the SAC alloy, the early nucleation and growth of the Ag3Sn phase can be prevented such that this early fatigue failure mechanism is defeated.<br>
The present invention teaches how to totally, essentially, or substantially suppress formation of the Ag3Sn plates by either of two methods or by a combination of the two methods. The first method comprises reducing the weight percent concentration of Ag in the SAC alloy to a value below the eutectic weight percent concentration of Ag such that Ag,Sn plate formation is thermodynamically impossible until the undercooling required to nucleate the solid Sn phase is reached. The second method comprises cooling the totally liquid phase of the SAC alloy at a cooling rate that is fast enough to prevent any solidified Ag3Sn from growing to a size that would facilitate fatigue cracking of the modified solder ball 15 of FIG. IB when the modified solder ball 15 is subject to cyclic or non-cyclic thermal transients (e.g., thermal cycle testing). FIGS. 2- 15 provide test support for the preceding two methods. FIG. 16 provides a thermodynamic model that explains the first method and predicts the requisite maximum Ag weight percent concentration that suppresses Ag3Sn plate formation. Chronologically, the inventors of the present invention first developed the thermodynamic model and used the thermodynamic model to predict the requisite maximum Ag weight percent concentration as a function of undercooling below the eutectic melting temperature of 217 °C of the ternary eutectic SAC alloy. Then the inventors conducted tests that confirmed the predictions of the thermodynamic model. The test results of FIGS. 2-15 are discussed next, followed by a discussion of the thermodynamic model in accordance with FIG. 16.<br>
FIGS. 2A-2B depict cross-sectional images of a solder joint associated with a SAC alloy solder ball 20 after being subject to thermal cycle testing. In FIGS. 2A and 2B, the solder ball 20 is attached to a nickel-gold pad 22 to which a module (i.e., a chip carrier-chip package) had been attached. The solder ball 20 is also attached to a copper pad 24 to which a circuit card had been attached. The pads 22 and 24 each have a 28-mil linear dimension across the pad surface. The solder ball 20 comprised a Sn-3.8Ag-0.7Cu SAC alloy prior to its attachment to the copper pad <br>
24 During attachment of the module to the circuit card, the solder ball 20 was formed with an estimated undercooling of about 15 - 25 °C based on thermocouple measurements using identical circuit card assemblies. The solder joint of solder ball 20 in FIGS. 2A and 2B is one of many similar solder joints, each of which having been subjected to 1000 to 2000 thermal cycles between 0 °C and 100 °C wherein the heating and cooling rates during thermal cycling from 100 °C to 0 °C were about 0.2 °C/sec. The region 26 (shown in FIG. 2A and also in a blown-up view in FIG. 2B) shows localized deformation in the joint structure of the solder ball 20. The joint structure has a column-like appearance after attachment to both pads 22 and 24, as shown in FIG. 2A. Because of the coefficient of thermal expansion ("CTE") difference between the module and the card, the solder joint is subject to a cyclic strain within each thermal cycle. After the thermal cycling, some of the solder joints were cross-sectioned to determine the mechanisms for failure. The cross section shown in FIGS. 2A and 2B does not show failure of the joint, but does show localized deformation (i.e., formation of crack 29) in the region 26 where a Ag3Sn plate 28 subtends a major fraction of the cross section of the joint. The localized deformation has occurred right at the surface of the plate by initially grain boundary sliding between the silver-tin in the metallic phase and the bounding tin-rich phase. This failure mechanism in some joint structures may lead to early failure such as an electrical open.<br>
FIGS. 3A-3B depict cross-sectional images of a solder joint associated with a ball grid array (BGA) SAC alloy solder ball 30 after being subject to thermal cycle testing. In FIGS. 3 A and 3B, the solder ball 30 is attached to a nickel-gold pad 32 to which a module had been attached. The solder ball 30 is also attached to a nickel-gold pad 34 to which a circuit card had<br>
Been attached. The pads 32 and 34 each have a 28-mil linear dimension across the pad surface. The solder ball 30 comprised a Sn-3.8Ag-0.7Cu SAC alloy prior to its attachment to the nickel- gold pad 34. During attachment of the module to the circuit card, the solder ball 30 was formed at a cooling rate of 0.7 - 0.9 °C/sec with an estimated undercooling of about 15 - 25 °C based on thermocouple measurements using identical circuit card assemblies. The solder joint in FIGS. 3 A and 3B is one of many similar solder joints, each of which having been subjected to 1500 - 2500 thermal cycles between 0 °C and 100 °C wherein the heating and cooling rates during thermal cycling from 100 °C to 0 °C were about 0.2 °C/sec. The region 36 (shown in FIG. 3A and also in an enlarged view in FIG. 3B) shows localized deformation in the joint structure of the solder ball 30. A fatigue failure 31 occurred near the pad 32, and there was no fatigue failure near the pad 34, which is consistent with the fact that the CTE differential between the solder ball module was much larger than the CTE differential between the solder ball and the circuit card. Near the pad 34, FIGS. 3A and 3B provide evidence that the Ag3Sn plate 38 can augment the fatigue cracking initiation process. The Ag3Sn plate 38 is an intermetallic structure that has grown near the pad 34 from a side of the ball 30. Due to the fatigue processes, there has been a strain localization at the surface of the Ag3Sn plate 38 giving rise to a deformation-induced void¬like structure 39 at a corner of the pad 34, and a crack growing from this void-like structufe into the bulk of the ball 30. This shows augmentation of the crack initiation and fatigue processes, which is the primary wearout mechanism for solder joints. The solder joint failure 31 was not caused by the Ag3Sn plate 38 as discussed supra.<br>
FIG. 3C depicts a cross-sectional image of a solder joint associated with a BGA SAC <br>
eljoy solder ball 40, showing crack propagation along a Ag3Sn plate 48 in the solder ball 40 following thermal cycle testing of the solder joint. In FIG. 3C, the solder ball 40 is attached to a nickel-gold pad 42 to which a module had been attached. The solder ball 40 is also attached to a copper pad 44 to which a circuit card had been attached. The pads 42 and 44 each had a 28-mil linear dimension across the pad surface. The solder ball 40 comprised a Sn-3.8Ag-0.7Cu SAC alloy prior to its attachment to the nickel-gold pad 42. During attachment of the module to the circuit card, the solder ball 40 was formed at a cooling rate of 0.7 - 0.9 °C/sec with an estimated undercooling of about 15 - 25 °C based on thermocouple measurements using identical circuit card assemblies. The solder joint in FIGS. 3C had been subjected to 2114 thermal cycles between 0 °C and 100 °C wherein the heating and cooling rates during thermal cycling from 100 °C to 0 °C were approximately 0.2 °C/sec. FIG. 3C illustrates propagation of a crack 49 along the surface of the Ag3Sn plate 48 and continued propagation of the crack 49 through the entire width of solder ball 40 such that the crack 49 constitutes a failure in the form of an electrical open circuit.<br>
In, summary, FIGS. 2A-2B, 3A-3B, and 3C illustrates a correlation between the existence Ag3Sn plates in SAC alloy solder balls and crack formation and/or fatigue failure in the solder balls following thermal cycling such as, inter alia, thermal cycle testing. Thus, it is desirable to prevent or severely inhibit the formation of Ag3Sn plates in SAC alloy solder balls. FIGS. 4-15 provides testing support for the methods of the present invention for preventing or severely inhibiting the formation of Ag3Sn plates in SAC alloy solder balls.<br>
FIGS. 4A-4D are cross-sectional images of a SAC alloy solder ball 50 after being reflow- soldered to a nickel-gold pad 54 at cooling rates of 3.0 °C/sec, 1.2 °C/sec, and 0.2 °C/sec in FIGS. 4A, 4B, and 4C, respectively, in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. FIG. 4D is an enlarged view of the region 56 in FIG. 4C. The solder ball 50 comprised a Sn- 3.8Ag-0.7Cu SAC alloy prior to its attachment to the pad 54. The pad 54 has a 25-mil linear dimension across the pad 54 surface. The peak temperature of the solder ball 50 during a melting reflow process was 240 °C, and the undercooling relative to 217 °C was estimated to be in the range of about 15-25 °C for FIGS. 4A - 4D, based on thermocouple measurements using identical or analogous circuit card assemblies. FIGS. 4A an 4B show at most very small Ag3Sn plates at the 3.0 and 1.2 °C/sec cooling rates, respectively. FIGS. 4C-4D shows Ag3Sn plates 55,57,58, and 59 wherein the Ag3Sn plate 57 spans almost the entire length across the solder ball 50. FIG. 4D also shows a Cu6Sn3 structure 53 in the form of a distorted hexagonal rod with round hole in the center of the distorted hexagon. Thus, FIGS. 4A-4D show that Ag3Sn plates are suppressed or of a very small size in the Sn-3.8Ag-0.7Cu SAC alloy solder ball 50 when the cooling rate is at least 1.2 °C/sec, but is not suppressed and may be large when the cooling rate is 0.2 °C/sec.<br>
Note that the linear length scale on FIGS. 4A-4C is indicated by the "5 mils" text at the upper left corner of each Figure, which denotes that 5 mils of true length corresponds to the length of the line segment directly under the "5 mils" text. Similarly in FIG. 4D, the linear length scale is indicated by the "2 mils" text at the upper left corner of FIG. 4D, which denotes that 2 mils of true length corresponds to the length of the line segment directly under the "2 mils" text. Similar scale indications appear in FIGS. 5-11 and 13, described m/ra.<br>
FIGS. 5A-5C are cross-sectional images of a SAC alloy solder ball 60 after being reflow- <br>
•soldered to a nickel-gold pad 64 at cooling rates of 3.0 °C/sec, 1.2 °C/sec, and 0.2 °C/sec in FIGS. 5A, 5B, and 5C, respectively, in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. The solder ball 60 comprised a Sn-3.4Ag-0.9Cu SAC alloy prior to its attachment to the pad 64. The pad 64 has a 25-mil linear dimension across the pad 64 surface. The undercooling relative to 217 °C was estimated to be in the range of about 15 - 25 °C for FIGS. 5A - 5C, based on thermocouple measurements using identical or analogous circuit card assemblies. FIGS. 5A an 5B show at most very small Ag3Sn plates at the 3.0 and 1.2 °C/sec cooling rates, respectively. FIG. 5C shows large Ag3Sn plates 66, 67, 68, and 69. Thus, FIGS. 5A-5C show that Ag3Sn plates are suppressed or of a very small size in the Sn-3.4Ag-0.9Cu SAC alloy solder ball 60 when the cooling rate is at least 1.2 °C/sec, but is not suppressed and may be large when the cooling rate is 0.2 °C/sec.<br>
FIGS. 6A-6C are cross-sectional images of a SAC alloy solder ball 70 after being reflow- soldered to a nickel-gold pad 74 at cooling rates of 3.0 °C/sec, 1.2 °C/sec, and 0.2 °C/sec in FIGS. 6A, 6B, and 6C, respectively, in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. The solder ball 70 comprised a Sn-3.2Ag-0.9Cu SAC alloy prior to its attachment to the pad 74. The pad 74 has a 25-mil linear dimension across the pad 74 surface. The estimated undercooling relative to 217 °C was in the range of about 15-25 °C for FIGS. 6A - 6C, based on thermocouple measurements using identical or analogous circuit card assemblies. FIGS. 6A an 6B show at most very small Ag3Sn plates at the 3.0 and 1.2 °C/sec cooling rates, respectively. FIG. 6C shows large Ag3Sn plates 76 and 77. FIG. 6B and 6C shows small Ag3Sn plates 75,78 and 79, wherein the Ag3Sn plates 75, 78 and 79 may be small enough not to facilitate fatigue cracking of the solder ball 70 when the solder ball 70 is subject to cyclic or non-cyclic thermal transients (e.g., thermal cycle testing). Thus, FIGS. 6A-6C show that Ag3Sn plates are suppressed or of a very small size in the Sn-3.2Ag-0.9Cu SAC alloy solder ball 70 when the cooling rate is at least 1.2 °C/sec, but is not suppressed and may be large when the cooling rate is 0.2 °C/sec.<br>
FIGS. 7A-7C are cross-sectional images of a SAC alloy solder ball 80 after being reflow- soldered to a nickel-gold pad 84 at cooling rates of 3.0 °C/sec, 1.2 °C/sec, and 0.2 °C/sec in FIGS. 7A, 7B, and 7C, respectively, in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. The solder ball 80 comprised a Sn-2.5Ag-0.9Cu SAC alloy prior to its attachment to the pad 84. The pad 84 has a 25-mil linear dimension across the pad 84 surface. The estimated undercooling relative to 217 °C was estimated to be in the range of about 15 - 25 °C for FIGS. 7A - 7C, based on thermocouple measurements using identical or analogous circuit card assemblies. FIGS. 7A, 7B, and 7C each show at most very small Ag3Sn plates at each of the three cooling rates of 3.0, 1.2, and 0.2 °C/sec, respectively. The Ag3-Sn is solidified not as plates but is dispersed in a striation structure as particulates between the majority tin phase, which shows up in FIGS. 7A- 7C as background, light grey striations 82. The dispersed! intermetallic compound structure, comprising Ag3Sn and Cu6Sn5 particulates, is quite homogeneous and therefore less susceptible to stress than are the Ag3Sn plates. Thus, FIGS. 7A-7C show that Ag3Sn plates are suppressed or of a very small size in the Sn-2.5Ag-0.9Cu SAC alloy solder ball 80 when the cooling rate is in the range of 0.2 to 3.0 °C/sec. Note that essentially the same results of Ag3Sn plate suppression were obtained for the same test as is shown in FIGS. 7A-7C, except that the Ag concentration was 2.7% instead of 2.5%. <br>
FIGS. 8A-8C are cross-sectional images of a SAC alloy solder ball 90 after being reflow- soldered to a nickel-gold pad 94 at cooling rates of 3.0 °C/sec, 1.2 °C/sec, and 0.2 °C/sec in FIGS. 8A, 8B, and 8C, respectively, in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. The solder ball 90 comprised a Sn-2.1Ag-0.9Cu SAC alloy prior to its attachment to the pad 94. The pad 94 has a 25-mil linear dimension across the pad 94 surface. The undercooling relative to 217 °C was estimated to be in the range of about 15 - 25 °C for FIGS. 8A - 8C, based on thermocouple measurements using identical or analogous circuit card assemblies. FIGS. 8A, 8B, and 8C each show at most very small Ag3Sn plates at each of the three cooling rates of 3.0,1.2, and 0.2 °C/sec, respectively. The Ag,-Sn is solidified not as plates but is dispersed in a striation structure as has been discussed supra in conjunction with FIGS. 7A-7C. Thus, FIGS. 8A-8C show that Ag3Sn plates are suppressed or of a very small size in the Sn-2.1Ag-0.9Cu SAC alloy solder ball 90 when the cooling rate is in the range of 0.2 to 3.0 °C/sec.<br>
In summary, FIGS. 4-8 show that Ag3Sn plate formation in a SAC alloy solder ball attached to a substrate (e.g., a circuit card or a chip carrier) is "substantially suppressed" if the Ag concentration in the solder ball is 2.7% or less irrespective of the cooling rate, or if the cooling rate is at least 3.0 °C/sec irrespective of the Ag concentration; and Ag3Sn plate formation in a SAC alloy solder ball attached to a substrate may not be substantially suppressed if the Ag* concentration in the solder ball is 3.2% or more with cooling rates of 1.2 °C/sec or less. Definitionally, Ag3Sn plate formation in a solder ball (or in a solder joint) is "substantially suppressed" if there is no Ag3Sn plate formation in the solder ball (or in the solder joint), or if any formed Ag3Sn plate is small enough so as not to facilitate fatigue cracking of the solder ball (oc solder joint) when the solder ball (or solder joint) is subject to cyclic or non-cyclic thermal induced stresses (e.g., during thermal cycle testing). As an example, the Ag3Sn plates 75,78 and 79 of FIG. 6B and 6C are small enough so as not to facilitate said fatigue cracking, while large AgjSn plates 76 and 77 of FIG. 6C are large enough to facilitate said fatigue cracking. The cutoff Ag concentration below which Ag3Sn plate formation is substantially suppressed depends on the magnitude of the undercooling as will be explained infra in conjunction with the thermodynamic model of FIG. 16. Thus, the cutoff Ag concentration may lie typically somewhere between 2.7% Ag and 3.2% Ag depending on the magnitude of the undercooling. The cutoff Ag concentration can be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art without undue experimentation by performing tests of the type associated with FIGS. 4-8.<br>
Definitionally, Ag3Sn plate formation in a solder ball (or in a solder joint) is "essentially suppressed" if there is essentially no Ag3Sn plate formation in the solder ball (or in the solder joint). FIGS. 4-8 show that Ag3Sn plate formation in a SAC alloy solder ball attached to a substrate (e.g., a circuit card or a chip carrier) is "essentially suppressed" if the Ag concentration in the solder ball is 2.7% or less substantially irrespective of the cooling rate, or if the cooling rate is at least 3.0 °C/sec substantially irrespective of the Ag concentration.<br>
Additionally, FIGS. 4-8 show that Ag3Sn plate formation in a SAC alloy solder baH attached to a substrate (e.g., a circuit card or a chip carrier) is substantially suppressed, substantially independent of the Ag concentration, if the cooling rate is sufficiently high (i.e., at least about 3.0 °C/sec). Thus, Ag3Sn plate formation could be substantially suppressed with sufficiently high cooling rates, even if commercial SAC alloy compositions (i.e., 3.8 Ag - 4.0 Ag) <br>
o?the ternai7 eutectic SAC alloy composition (i.e., 3.4Ag) is used. Since Ag3Sn plate formation is not substantially suppressed at a cooling rate of 1.2 °C/sec or less, there is a threshold cooling rate, between 1.2 and 3.0 °C/sec, above which Ag3Sn plate formation is substantially suppressed. The threshold cooling rate is a function of the composition of the SAC alloy and the available heterogeneous nuclei which foster the nucleation of the solid Sn phase. The threshold cooling rate can be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art without undue experimentation by performing tests of the type associated with FIGS. 4-8.<br>
FIGS. 9A-9C are cross-sectional images of a SAC alloy solder ball 100 after being reflow-soldered to a nickel-gold pad 104 at cooling rates of 3.0 °C/sec, 1.2 °C/sec, and 0.2 °C/sec in FIGS. 9A, 9B, and 9C, respectively, in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. The solder ball 100 comprised a Sn-3.5Ag alloy prior to its attachment to the pad 104. The pad 104 has a 24-mil linear dimension across the pad 104 surface. The undercooling relative to 217 °C was estimated to be in the range of about 15 - 25 °C for FIGS. 9A - 9C, based on thermocouple measurements using identical or analogous circuit card assemblies. FIGS. 9A, 9B, and 9C each show at most very small Ag3Sn plates at each of the three cooling rates of 3.0,1.2, and 0.2 °C/sec, respectively. It is noted that Cu is not a component of the solder ball 100 alloy. Thus, FIGS. 9A-9C show that, even though the Ag concentration by weight is high (i.e., 3.5%), Ag3Sn plates are substantially suppressed from being formed in the Sn-3.5Ag alloy solder ball 100 (which does not comprise copper) when the cooling rate is in the range of 0.2 to 3.0 °C/sec. This suggests that the absence of copper substantially suppresses large Ag3Sn plate formation when a solder ball alloy comprising tin and silver (but not copper) is cooled below 217 °C .<br>
FIGS. 1 OA-IOC are cross-sectional images of a SAC alloy solder ball 110 after being reflow-soldered to a copper pad 114 at cooling rates of 3.0 °C/sec, 1.2 °C/sec, and 0.2 °C/sec in FIGS. 10A, 10B, and 10C, respectively, in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. The solder ball 110 comprised a Sn-3.5Ag SAC alloy prior to its attachment to the pad 114. The pad 114 has a 25-mil linear dimension across the pad 114 surface. The undercooling relative to 217 °C was estimated to be in the range of about 15-25 °C for FIGS. 10A - 10C, based on thermocouple measurements using identical or analogous circuit card assemblies. FIGS. 10A and 10B each show at most very small Ag3Sn plates at each two cooling rates of 3.0 and 1.2 °C/sec, respectively. In contrast, FIG. 10C shows formation of the large Ag3Sn plate 116 at the cooling rate of 0.2 °C/sec. Although Cu is not a component of the solder ball 110 alloy prior to being heated and reflowed, existence of the Ag3Sn plate 116 together with the results discussed supra for FIGS. 9A-9C suggests that some copper has migrated from the pad 114 into the solder ball 110. Thus, the combined results shown on FIGS. 1 OA-10C and 9A- 9C suggest that copper may facilitate or augment the nucleation of the Ag3Sn plates. The inventors of the present invention have also determined that an addition of bismuth similarly facilitates or augments the nucleation of the Ag3Sn plates. Nonetheless, if the Ag concentration is sufficiently small (i.e., below the cutoff Ag concentration as discussed supra), then an addition of bismuth cannot facilitate or augment the nucleation of the Ag3Sn plates. Note that an addition of bismuth may prevent formation of tin pest as will be discussed infra.<br>
FIGS. 11-13 depict the morphology and geometry of Ag3Sn plates in the SAC solder alloy, in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. <br>
FIG. 11 is an optical image of a top view of Ag3Sn plates in SAC alloy solder balls attached to an array of BGA pads, wherein the majority Sn component of the SAC alloy has been etched away in FIG. 11 so that only the Ag3Sn and Cu6Sn5 components of the SAC alloy remain on the BGA pads, in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. The SAC alloy solder balls had been formed after being reflow-soldered to nickel-gold pads at a cooling rates of 0.02 °C/sec. The solder balls comprised a Sn-3.8Ag-0.4Cu SAC alloy prior to their being reflow-soldered to the BGA pads. The pads each have a 25-mil linear dimension across the pad surface. The pads appear in FIG. 11 as having approximately circular or slightly elliptical shapes and are organized in an ordered matrix pattern. The Ag3Sn plates appear in FIG. 11 as plate structures on top of the BGA pads. The largest measured Ag3Sn plate dimension parallel to the pad surfaces is about 30 mils (i.e., 762 microns). The dimension parallel to the pad surfaces of the distorted hexagonal Cu6Sns rods is typically about at 0.5 mils (i.e., 13 microns). The Ag3Sn plate morphology in FIG. 11 is highly variable. Due to the variable Ag3Sn plate orientation with respect to the viewing direction that is normal to the pad surfaces, some Ag3Sn plates appear plate-like while other AgjSn plates appear needle-like.<br>
FIG. 12 is a cross-sectional image of a SAC alloy solder ball 120 on a nickel-gold pad 127, wherein the solder ball 120 comprises Ag3Sn plates 121-126 with differing angular • orientations, in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. The solder ball 120 comprised a Sn-3.8Ag-0.7Cu alloy prior to its attachment to the pad 127. The angles of the Ag3Sn plates 121-126 with respect to the direction 129 vary from slightly above zero degrees for the Ag3Sn plate 124 to slightly below 90 degrees for the Ag3Sn plate 123. The SAC alloy solder<br>
Bail had been formed after being re flow-soldered to the pad 127 at a cooling rate of 0.02 °C/sec. The undercooling relative to 217 °C was estimated to be in the range of about 15-25 °C, based on thermocouple measurements using identical or analogous circuit card assemblies. The pad 127 has a 28-mil linear dimension across the pad 127 surface.<br>
FIGS. 13A-13B are images of an Ag3Sn plate 130 that remained after the majority Sn component had been had been etched away from a SAC alloy solder ball that had been soldered to a pad, in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. The solder ball 120 comprised a Sn-3.8Ag-0.7Cu alloy prior to its attachment to the pad. The SAC alloy solder ball had been formed after having been subject to a cooling rate of 0.02 °C/sec, after being heated above 217 °C. FIG. 13B is an enlarged view of region 133 of the Ag3Sn plate 130 of FIG. 13A. FIG. 13B depicts the morphology of the Ag3Sn plate 130. The plate 130 was analyzed for its ■ composition using Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectrum (EDS) technology, which confirmed that the plate 130 comprises Ag3Sn. The plate 130 represents other such plates similarly analyzed as having plate lengths typically in a range of 300-500 microns and plate thicknesses typically in a range, of 25-30 microns. A plate length as high as about 800 microns has been observed.<br>
FIG. 14 is a table showing pasty range variations as a function of deviations in copper and silver concentration from a eutectic Sn-3.4Ag-0.7Cu SAC alloy, in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. The pasty range AT is the differential between the liquidus temperature (TUQUIDUS) and the solidus temperature (TS0UDUS) for the SAC alloy. FIG. 14 shows AT at two copper weight percent concentrations (0.7% and 0.9%) and at five silver weight percent concentrations (2.1 %, 2.3%, 2.5%, 2.7%, and 2.9%). FIG. 14 shows AT in a 2 - 4 °C <br>
range over the five silver concentrations when the copper concentration is 0.7%, and AT in a 16 - 17 °C range over the five silver concentrations when the copper concentration is 0.9%. Thus, AT appears to be highly sensitive to the copper concentration but not very sensitive to the silver concentration in this hypoeutectic Ag compositional range<br>
FIG. 14 suggests that if the copper concentration is about 0.7% or lower, then the range over which the SAC alloy melts will be small based on the copper concentration alone, and the copper concentration may enlarge the melting range only by a degree or two. However, if the copper concentration is 0.9% or higher, then the two-phase temperature window over which solidification/melting occurs is much larger (e.g., at least 15 °C), which may be unacceptable because the solder defect rate in the solder joint could go up dramatically. Such solder defects include, inter alia, fillet lifting, pad lifting, solder ball lifting, etc., all of which may cause an open-circuit in the solder joint. Thus, depending on how significant the pasty range is in an intended application, it is may be desirable for the copper concentration in the SAC solder ball to be no higher than 0.7,0.8,0.9 weight percent. Generally, the pasty range can be controlled by the copper weight percent concentration in the SAC alloy in a manner that reflects the intended application. Thus, depending on the application, the pasty range may be controlled so as to be no more than a value such as 1 °C, 3 °C, 5 °C, 10 °C, 15 °C, 25 °C, etc.<br>
The preceding FIG. 14 results may be applied to the effect of soldering a SAC solder ball to either a copper pad or a nickel gold pad for the case in which the initial Cu concentration in the solder ball (i.e., the Cu concentration prior to reflow) is about 0.7%. If the pad is a copper pad, then during heating and reflow, copper in the pad migrates to the liquid solder ball which<br>
could raise the Cu concentration in the solder ball to 1.0% in just two or three reflows. At each successive reflow, the copper concentration in the solder ball increases until the copper concentration in the liquid tin reaches saturation. If more copper were added when the copper concentration is at the saturated copper concentration, the excess copper would come out of solution as a Cu6Sn5 precipitant. The saturated copper concentration is temperature dependent and is about 1.5% at about 250 °C. One could, of course, start with a SAC solder ball having a copper concentration of 1.5% prior to the solder ball being solder reflowed to a copper pad.<br>
If it is desired to prevent the SAC solder ball from having a final Cu concentration (i.e., an after-reflow Cu concentration) of no more than about 0.7%, the initial Cu concentration in the solder ball may be set to no more than about 0.4 or 0.5 %. These considerations also apply to other solderable surface finishes such as immersion Ag and Pd surface finishes having thin surface plating. In these instances, the thin surface plating is readily dissolved in the solder during a single reflow. Under these conditions, the underlying Cu pad is typically exposed to the solder and the Cu concentration in the solder joint can rise, accordingly. If the pad is a nickel- gold pad, however then during heating and reflow, the nickel in the intermetallic phase at the pad interface ties up a substantial portion of the total fraction of the initial copper in the solder ball,<br>
causing the copper concentration of the solder ball to drop. Thus if the initial Cu concentration is<br>
«<br>
about 0.7% and if the SAC solder ball is soldered to a nickel-gold pad, then the copper concentration of the SAC solder ball could be reduced to 0.4% in just 2 or 3 reflows. Thus, there is a wide range of copper that is comprised by the after-reflow solder ball depending on the pad material to which the solder ball has been soldered. However, lowering the Cu concentration is <br>
nbt adverse from a pasty range point of view, as explained supra, and it may therefore desirable for the after-reflow Cu concentration in the solder ball to be at or below the eutectic Cu concentration of about 0.7% so that the pasty range is reasonably bounded to no more than about two or three °C. Accordingly, if the same solder ball alloy concentrations are used for both types of pads (i.e., a copper pad or a nickel-gold pad), then the initial copper concentration may be about 0.5 or 0.6%, so that the final copper concentration would end up at about 0.2% for a nickel-gold pad and at about 0.7 % for a copper pad, depending on the number of reflow cycles.<br>
Generally, there is no requirement for a lower bound of copper concentration in the SAC alloy. Nonetheless, the melting temperature of the eutectic tin-silver alloy is 221 °C, and as copper is added to the eutectic tin-silver alloy the melting temperature decreases monotonically as the cooper wight percent increases such that the melting temperature is reduced to about 217 °C as the copper weight percent concentration is increased to the 0.7% - 0.9% range. Since having a lower melting temperature for copper may be significant for some applications, it may be desirable for some applications for the copper weight percent concentration concentration to be at least about Y%, wherein representative values of Y% are 0.1 %, 0.2%, 0.3%, 0.4%, 0.5%, 0.6%, and 0.7%.<br>
In utilizing the present invention, the solder paste composition may be taken into account. For example, a commercial solder paste having 4.0Ag is in widespread use currently. If a purchaser of the SAC solder ball utilizes the 4.0Ag solder paste with a SAC solder ball of the present invention, the SAC solder ball Ag concentration may be adjusted downward to compensate for the additive Ag effect of the solder paste by 0.2%, and another 0.2% based on a tolerance used by manufacturers of the SAC solder ball. Thus, if 2.7Ag or 2.8Ag is the maximum desirable Ag concentration of the solder joint associated with the solder ball, then the initial Ag concentration of the solder ball may be reduced by 0.4% to account for both the solder paste composition and the solder ball manufacturer's compositional tolerance. Accordingly, the manufacturer would produce modules with a solder ball Ag concentration close to 2.3%. Note that the preceding numbers are merely illustrative, since the Ag concentration in the solder paste may vary and the manufacturer's solder ball tolerance may vary. Generally, the initial Ag concentration of the solder ball may be additively reduced by both the effect of the Ag concentration of the solder paste and the solder ball manufacturer's compositional tolerance. Thus, in many embodiments the Ag concentration of the solder joint exceeds the initial Ag concentration of the solder ball by at least about 0.2% (e.g., by 0.4% in the preceding example). Also note that if the Ag concentration of the solder paste is less than the desired Ag concentration of the SAC solder ball, then the effect of the solder paste on adjusting the initial Ag concentration of the SAC solder ball would be subtractive rather than additive.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention involves adding at least 0.1% bismuth (Bi) (e.g., 0.1% to 0.2% bismuth) to the SAC solder ball to prevent tin pest from occurring. Tin pest may occur at a temperature well below room temperature and is characterized by an allotropic phase transformation of tin which transforms the normal tetragonal structure of tin ("white tin") into a body-centered cubic structure of tin(i.e., a "grey tin" powder). The transformation from white tin to grey tin destroys the mechanical properties of the structure that comprises the tin. The bismuth additive will suppress tin pest. Another additive that will suppress tin pest is antimony <br>
"(Sb). However, bismuth is less toxic than antimony under some conditions associated with recycling of electronic assembly materials. Nonetheless, either bismuth or antimony may be added to the SAC solder ball of the present invention. Higher levels of bismuth and antimony may, in some instances, be added to improve solder wetting and/or the mechanical properties of the solder joints. ■ Additionally, any additive that is known to a person of ordinary skill in the art as useful for suppressing tin pest may be added to the SAC solder ball of the present invention.<br>
FIG. 15 is a bar chart resulting from microhardness tests conducted at a Vicker's force level of 10 grams. FIG. 15 shows microhardness as a function of Ag weight percent concentration and cooling rate for a Sn-XAg-0.9Cu SAC alloy wherein X is weight percent silver, in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. Note that with respect to having higher thermal cycle fatigue life, relatively lower values of microhardness are more desirable than relatively higher values of microhardness. In FIG. 15, the lighter bars denote a SAC alloy tested for microhardness after having been formed at a cooling rate of 0.02 °C/sec. The black bars denote a SAC alloy tested for microhardness as received from the SAC alloy vendor and said as-received SAC alloy had been formed at a very rapid cooling rate (i.e., much more rapid than 0.02 °C/sec). Let AH denote a differential in hardness between the as-received alloy and the 0.02 °C/sec cooled alloy, at a given value Z of silver concentration in weight percent FIG. 15 shows much larger values of AH at the highest value of Z (i.e., at 3.0Ag - 3.4Ag) than at the lowest values of Z (i.e., at 2.0Ag - 2.5Ag). At 2.0Ag - 2.5Ag, AH is only 2 to 3 Hv. The relatively large values of AH at 3.0Ag - 3.4Ag (i.e., 4 to 8 Hv) are likely caused by the presence of Ag3Sn plates in the slowly cooled condition and the absence of large plates in the fapidly cooled condition. In both types of solidified structures, the same amount of Ag3Sn exits; however, the Ag3Sn is dispersed differently in the two solidified structures leading to the hardness variation. The Ag3Sn incorporated in the large plates takes away material that can later be incorporated in the Sn matrix as finely dispersed Ag3Sn particulates upon final solidification. The dispersed fine particulates of Ag3Sn are arrayed in dense web like patterns between the Sn dendritic structures. These structures are distributed evenly across the solder joint. However, the density of these structures increases as the Ag concentration in the liquid phase which undergoes the final solidification (producing the solid Sn phase) increases. These more dense structures manifest higher hardnesses. The relatively small values of AH at 2.0Ag - 2.5Ag (where Ag3Sn plate formation is suppressed in accordance with the present invention) is desirable, since the microhardness is insensitive to the processing conditions that are used to assemble a SAC solder ball to a circuit card.<br>
FIG. 16 depicts a section (i.e., a cut) at a constant Cu concentration of 0.7 wt. % of the ternary Sn-Ag-Cu phase diagram, in accordance with embodiments.of the present invention. In the pure liquid region 210, which is located to the left of the liquidus line 200 as shown, Ag3Sn cannot exist in equilibrium; i.e., Ag3Sn cannot nucleate and grow. If Ag3Sn were present in the pure liquid region 210, then the Ag3Sn would dissolve back into the pure liquid of region 210. In region 220, which is located to the right of the liquidus line 200 as shown, Ag3Sn can nucleate and grow; Ag3Sn plates can therefore exist in region 220. The region 230 lies below the eutectic melting line 217 of 217 °C. In the region 230, the Sn liquid phase is substantially metastable and cannot easily nucleate. Independent measurements by the inventors of the solidification process <br>
in .the Sn-3.8Ag-0.7 Cu alloy, using differential scanning calorimetry at scan rates of 0.1 °C /sec, have shown undercoolings of 15 °C to 30 °C before the Sn phase solidifies. The metastability of the liquid Sn phase depends on the availability of sites for heterogeneous nucleation to take place.<br>
Extrapolated line 201 represents an extrapolation of the liquidus line 200 below the eutectic melting line 217 into the metastable region 230. The extrapolated line 201 is nonlinear and is formed by extrapolation that takes the curvature of the liquidus line 200 into account. The region 230 has two portions: a portion 231 to the left of the extrapolated line 201, and a portion 232 to the right of the extrapolated line 201. A ternary phase transformation under equilibrium conditions would require essentially no undercooling and would enable solidification (i.e., crystallization) of all three phases (i.e., the Sn, Ag3Sn, and Cu6Sn5 phases) at 217 °C. With the ternary system in FIG. 16, there is no ternary phase transformation, because the tin phase is not easily nucleated, but rather is easily supercooled (i.e., undercooled) in the liquid state and is thus metastable substantially below the line 217 of 217 °C. The extrapolated line 201 has the thermodynamic characteristics of the liquidus line 200 under this metastable condition. Therefore, in the portion 231 of the region 230, Ag3Sn cannot exist in equilibrium and thus cannot nucleate and grow. Accordingly, if a given amount of undercooling (5T) below the line 217 is assumed, then the extrapolated line 201 may be used to infer the maximum Ag weight percent (AgMAX) that will place the ternary mixture in the portion 231 of the region 230. Thus if the Ag weight percent is AgMAX and the temperature is at least 217 °C - 5T, then solidified Ag3Sn is thermodynamically barred from being formed, because the ternary composition is in the "pDrtion 231 of the region 230. As a first example, if 5T=10 °C then AgMAX=3.0%, from use of the extrapolated line 201. As a second example, if 5T=20 °C then AgMAX=2.7%, from use of the extrapolated line 201. As a third example, if 5T=30 °C then AgMAX=2.5%, from use of the extrapolated line 201. The preceding values of AgMAX were not determined graphically from FIG. 16, but were determined numerically by using the nonlinear equation that represents the extrapolated line 201. Thus if the temperature is at least 207 °C, 197 °C, or 187 °C, then the AgjSn cannot nucleate if the Ag weight percent is no higher than 3.0%, 2.7%, or 2.5%, respectively. The preceding model uses as a temperature baseline the eutectic temperature of 217 °C at which tin would nucleate under equilibrium conditions. The tin phase in the region 230 below 217 °C is undercooled and would nucleate if it could, but it cannot because such nucleation is kinetically inhibited. However, with sufficient undercooling 5T, the tin phase will nucleate. Typically, such sufficient undercooling 5T is about 15 -25 °C based on experimental data to which the inventors have access. Thus if the tin begins to nucleate at 217 °C minus 15 °C, then based on the preceding calculations, the Ag concentration in the alloy should be no more than 2.8-2.9% so that the Ag3Sn cannot begin to nucleate until the temperature is 15 °C below 217 °C. Similarly, if the tin begins to nucleate at 217 °C minus 25 °C, then based on the preceding calculations, the Ag concentration should be no more than 2.6% so that the Ag3Sn cannot begin to nucleate until the temperature is 25 °C below 217 °C. Accordingly, the maximum Ag concentration to thermodynamically prevent nucleation of Ag3Sn is 2.6% if 5T=25 °C and 2.8-2.9% if 5T=15 °C. Although nucleation and growth are kinetic phenomena, the present invention thermodynamically bars the nucleation and growth from occurring, because <br>
incipient nuclei are thermodynamically unstable if the ternary composition is confined to the portion 231 of the region 230.<br>
In relation to the preceding discussion of FIG. 16, let the silver have a weight percent concentration X in the SAC alloy. In accordance with the present invention, X is sufficiently small (such as, inter alia, by selection or by predetermination) that formation of Ag3Sn plates is substantially suppressed when the SAC alloy in a liquefied state is being solidified by being cooled to a lower temperature TL at which the solid Sn phase is nucleated. The lower temperature TL corresponds to the undercooling 6T relative to the eutectic melting temperature Te of the SAC alloy, wherein TE is about equal to 217 °C. Mathematically, this means that TL = TE-6T.<br>
In consideration of the magnitudes and variations in weight percent concentration of silver and copper in the SAC alloy as well as small amounts of other alloy constituents such as bismuth that may be present, as discussed supra for the present invention, the majority constituent of tin in the SAC alloy of the present invention is at least about 90%.<br>
