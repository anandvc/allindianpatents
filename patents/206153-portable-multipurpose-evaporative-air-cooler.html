FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a portable multipurpose evaporative cooler with an emergency light, operational on in-built battery power supply.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The water evaporative cooling systems are one of the most economical &amp; widely used cooling technique. This conventional type of cooling technique is been employed for past so many decades though generally they have larger dimensions of sizes, heavy, power and water consumptions. This, makes it difficult for the existing prior art in its portability feature and to have a battery backup. New applications, modifications and additions to this conventional cooling technique can only be brought to the notice and hence efforts were been taken under this invention. It is difficult to achieve suflicient and handsome cooling with the existing design of the fan and the water pump in a portable size and with low power consumption. It is also difficult to operate such kind of evaporative cooling system on battery back-ups .In the country like India, there is an ever growing power shortage and hence power cuts is a regular happening. Therefore there arises a need of such a portable cooling and lighting device that can operate on both the modes of power supply i.e. on ac. mains power supply and dc. battery power supply.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Portability here, defines as a device that is compact, light in weight and operational, even if carried from place to place. The cooler case is designed compact to accommodate all the functional parts of the cooler like, transformer, battery, electrical and electronic circuits, fan water pump, water reservoir, cooling pads and emergency lamp. To achieve portability and to have an efficient battery-back in such type of evaporative cooling system, it becomes necessary to have a small size fan and  water pump, with low power consumption for a smaller battery size. The fan should be capable enough to suck in air through the cooling pads and deliver it out of the cooler in a sufficient quantity, so that the user gets a sufficient cooling comfort. To make this cooler to operate on a sufficient battery back-up, it becomes necessary that the cooler should deliver high velocities of cool air at a very low power usage. Hence, during the evolution of this idea, maximum efforts were being directed towards overcoming the above described constraints. The cooler fan<br><br><br>
derived in here, has two aerodynamicalry designed blades that can rotate at a very high speed and at a relatively low power consumption. A miniature centrifugal type water pump coupled with the cooler that is designed to achieve the required water head with a very low power usage. A small size tube light lamp is mounted on the cooler case and it operates on the same battery back-up. This makes the cooler a multi-purpose cooling and lighting device, specially during non-availability of ac. mains supply.<br><br><br>

A step-down transformer (9) 230-18 volts ac. power supply, batteries (1) which in turn provides dc. power supply, a dc. operated fan (7) which draws air through the housing and across the water saturated pads (6). A dc. operated pump (8) which supplies water through pipe to perforated pipe arrangement (5).These all are connected to a PCB circuit (fig. 8). Air diverter (4) is mounted on the circular opening in front of the tan to get required air flow direction. Switches (2) arc used to regulate the fan speed and an on/off switch for pump, mounted on the electrical control panel. The size of cooler presently made is near about height 350 mm, length 262 ram and width 234 mm. Weight of the cooler is about 8 kg. including battery unit (I) mounted on the cooler. The body of the cooler is made from fiber glass, the grids are made from plastic and air diverter (4) is made from steel. The water tank capacity is about 6 liters which is sufficient for the cooler to operate for about three to five hours. The fan biade(3) employed here is 6 to 7 inch in diameter, mounted on a small dc. motor (7) having an rpm of 4500 to 7000. An electronic regulator (2) is attached with this motor for varying the speed gradually. A small designed centrifugal type water pump (8) of height 100 mm and diameter 40 mm, which easily fits on the base of the cooler's water tank and has a water delivery head about 4 feet through a 10 mm diameter delivery pipe<br>
(5), this is sufficient to supply water continuously to the cooling pads<br><br><br>
(6).These cooling pads are mounted on the three sides of the cooler case by plastic grids. The electrical parts like , switches, regulator (2) and indicators are mounted on the top-front fourth side of the cooler case. An electronic circuit ( fig. 8) is mounted on the outer side of the battery compartment inside the cooler case.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFFERED EMBODIMENT<br>
This cooler can also facilitate the attachment of FM radio, emergency light, other peripheral devices operational on same dc. voltages. A tube light lamp mounted on the top of the cooler case is the part of the standard accessories. This lamp is hinged on the top roof of the cooler case. Because of the hinge, the lamp can be positioned horizontally and vertically.<br>
There is no ac. power supply available vehicles like Vans, Trucks etc. So this cooler made to operate only on 12 volts dc. power supply can easily be fitted on these vehicles as huge 12 volt battery is always available. A slight modification in the cooler water tank, the size and the weight of the cooler makes it convenient to fit in such vehicles without disturbing their inner space.<br><br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
The cooler case (fig. V) is a cubical rectangular shape in which the bottom of case is a tank &amp; the four sides of the ease are above this water tank. The three sides of the case are designed to mount the cooling pads (6) and the fourth side has a circular opening behind which the fan assembly is mounted A metal strip air diverter (4) and a grill is mounted in this circular opening to avoid hazard and to have desired air flow direction. The top of this case has an in-built compartment, made to accommodate batteries (1) &amp; to fix. in the transformer (9), circuits (fig 8) and a blow-up fuse.<br>
On the outer top of this case, a small size 6 inches tube light assembly is mounted through a hinge to make the light stand. The control panel is in-built with "the case and is over the lop side of the circular opening through which the air is delivered. This control panel of the cooler comprises of a main switch, an on/off switch for the socket on which the tube light is connected through a wire &amp; pin . Also any other electrical equipment that can operate on these voltages can also be plugged into this socket Two LED light indicators are also mounted on this control panel, of which one indicates the charging of the battery &amp; the other indicate whether the water pump is operational or not.<br>
The fan (3) mounted on the circular opening on the front side of the cooler case. The fan comprises of a fan motor (7) which operates up-to 18 volts and has current consumption of mere 1.8 amps, the fan diameter is of 6.25 inches having two blades shaped to deliver high velocities of air at minimal current consumption and with acceptable air cutting noise. This fan has a circular ring on the outer periphery of the fan motor body. This arrangement is nut bolted to the four 'Z' shape MS clamps and this total arrangement is then mounted on the case with nut-bolts. This fan is connected to a speed regulator circuit (2) to regulate fan speed ranging from 0 to more than 5000 rpm's. Such a high rpm. makes the fan to deliver air at a wind speed ranging from 0 to 9m/sec. Air masses through water saturated pads, gets cool and the fan that delivers this cool air at such a speed that, delivers a very good comfort to the user. The blade profile and the motor are both designed to aehieve the above said parameters.<br><br><br>
Another important factor of this cooler is the water pump (8). This pump is a typical centrifugal water pump but very small in size i.e. about 6 inches in height and 1.5 inches in diameter. The pump comprises of an cylindrical shaped hollow plastic body. At one end of this cylindrical case, an impeller body is mounted and on the other end  a motor is mounted. The impeller body has an opening from the bottom to such in the water and, a pipe opening on the periphery of-the impeller body, -to push the water outside into the delivery head pipe and thereby connected to the perforated pipe assembly (5). The impelleF has eight fans and is coupled to the motor shaft with the help of a connecting rod and a coupling. This water pump, "has a delivery head of about 4 to 5 feet through a 0.5 inches diameter pipe . The motor used in this pump is 12 volt dc. motor, such motors are commonly used in -automotive tape recorders and car music systems. Hence, the power consumption of this pump is very low i;e. about 0.5 amps. The pipe of 0.51nehes diameter is attached to this, pump impeller body which carries water from this, pump to the perforated pipe arrangement. This perforated pipe arrangement is mounted on the top of wood-wool cooling pads, on the inner side of the case. Hence the-water pumped from the water tank is made to drip over the cooling pads, making the pads wet before falling back into the water tank. The pump motor is connected to an on/off  switch which thereby is connected to the electronic control circuit(2).<br>
The electrical power supply transformer (9) is mounted at the top, inside of the cooler case and outside the battery compartment. This step-down transformer, is.of 230 volts to 18 volts and of 2.5 amps rating. The capacity Of this transformer is sufficient to operate the cooler and charging the batteries. This transformer gets the input of 230 volts ac. mains supply and delivers output of 18 volts to the electronic circuit.<br>
The electronic circuit (9) is mounted on the outside of the battery compartment, inside the cooler case. This electronic circuit converts the input 18 volts ac. power supply into dc. power supply and further delivers desired outputs. This circuit has an controlled output for charging the batteries and two more outputs for operating the water pump and the fan regulator. This electronic circuit is designed such to produce desired operational outputs. During power cuts or in the absence of ac. mains supply, the circuit makes a change-over to the battery power supply, so as to facilitate the cooler to operate on both the modes of power supply.<br><br><br>
Thrcc, 6 volts 4.5 Ah. rating batteries (1) arc used in this cooler for battery back-up power supply . These batteries are mounted in the compartment in¬built on the top side of the cooler case and has an opening at the back side of cooler case. These batteries are connected to the electronic circuit through a blow up fuse, from where they get controlled charging and deliver a desired power supply to the connected operational parts of the cooler.<br>
The power consumption of the cooler is very low which is almost about 28 watts and hence it can operate on the battery back-up for about 3 to 4 hours. This is achieved by an efficient design of the fan, the water pump and the electronic circuit, thereby delivering maximum comfort at very low power consumption. The cooler body is made up of fiber glass and hence light in weight, this can also be made from sheet metal and plastic moldings, the total weight of the cooler is not more than 8 kilograms, including batteries . Hence the cooler achieves a portability feature. During the non- availability of ac. mains power supply, that occurs because of power cuts or any other reasons than this cooler can still be operational on battery back-up for hours. The feature of tube- light lamp mounted on this cooler and operational on the in-house cooler batteries, increases its utility during power cuts and particularly during dark. This makes this cooler a unique, multi-purpose cooling and lighting device. Irrespective of the various features present in this cooler, these arc well feasible for general conventional use, as the power requirements of this cooler is much lower than the existing prior art. Modifications and variations may be made to the disclosed embodiments without departing from the subject and sprit of the invention is as defined by the claims.<br><br><br>
