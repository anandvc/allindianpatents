				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The invention is in the field of mobile cellular telecommunications in<br>
general, and the use of concatenatable Point-To-MultiPoint (PTMP) broadcast<br>
messages for displaying display messages on personal cellular<br>
telecommunications devices in particular.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
In Applicant's WO 01/32558 A2 entitled "Method for Operating a<br>
Cellular Telecommunications Network, and Method for Operating a Personal<br>
Cellular Telecommunications Device" and WO 01/52572 Al entitled "Method<br>
far Operating a Cellular Telecommunications Network", the contents of which<br>
are incorponted herein by reference, mere is illustrated and described a screen<br>
saver application for displaying display messages on personal cellular<br>
 telecommunications devices in a screen saver like manner, namely, their display<br>
is temporarily interrupted during, say, a voice call, an Internet session, and the<br>
like. The display messages are preferably so-called "interactive display<br>
messages" in the sense mat a subscriber can automatically activate a Point-To-<br>
Point (PTP) transmission response mechanism from a dedicated response means<br>
integrally provided in a display message. Interactive display messages are<br>
preferably transmitted over a Point-To-MultiPoint (PTMP) transmission<br>
capability as opposed to over a PTP transmission capability, thereby rendering an<br>
interactive cellular broadcasting service.<br>
ETSI's GSM 03 Al standard entitled "Technical Realization of Cellular<br>
Broadcast Service", the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference,<br><br>
standardizes a so-called "macromessage" constituted by between one and 15<br>
broadcast messages each having a 82 byte payload for transporting long display<br>
messages of up to a maximum of 1230 bytes. This upper limit of 15 broadcast<br>
messages is due to the provisioning of only 4 bits for the purpose of specifying<br>
the number of pages in a macromessage i.e. 1111. Despite the inclusion of the<br>
macromessage feature since the inception of the GSM 03.41 standard, neither do<br>
many installed OSM Cell Broadcast Controllers (CBCs) employed for parsing an<br>
display message into broadcast messages support the macromessage feature, nor<br>
do many Base Station Controllers (BSCs) for transmitting the broadcast<br>
messages and nor do many OSM personal cellular telecommunications devices.<br>
Looking to the future, assuming that all installed CBCs, BSCs and devices<br>
support the macromessage capability, the maximum 1230 byte payload of a<br>
macromessage may be insufficient to transport certain bandwidth heavy display<br>
messages, for example, including video content.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Generally speaking, the present invention is directed to the use of<br>
concatenatable Point-To-MultiPoint (PTMP) broadcast messages for displaying<br>
display messages on personal cellular telecommunications devices in a robust<br>
manner entirely independent of the macromessage capability of a transmitting<br>
BSC or the individual macromessage capability of a receiving personal cellular<br>
telecommunications device. Moreover, the present invention is capable of<br>
concatenating a far greater number of PTMP broadcast messages than the<br>
maximum concatenation capability of GSM 03.41's macromessage feature,<br>
thereby effectively enabling the CB channels dedicated for broadcast messages to<br>
be employed for transporting mobile services, for example, WAP, and the like<br>
The present invention is implemented by reserving a portion of the payload<br>
of an otherwise conventional PTMP broadcast message for concatenation<br>
purposes including concatenation of two or more PTMP broadcast messages<br>
and/or concatenation of two or more macromessages into a so-called<br><br>
supermacromessage. The reserved portions of the payloads of PTMP broadcast<br>
messages are therefore effectively pseudo-headers whose contents do not<br>
constitute part of the display message per se. However, whilst the pseudo-<br>
headers of PTMP broadcast messages in accordance with the present invention<br>
effectively replace the functionality of their header counterparts when used, there<br>
still exist network advantages for transmitting PTMP broadcast messages as part<br>
of macromessages where possible.<br>
A client application for displaying display messages transported over an<br>
air interface in accordance with the present invention is preferably customizable<br>
for execution on either a non-macromessage compliant device or a macromessage<br>
compliant device. The customization is preferably achieved by way of a<br>
customization protocol, for example, as illustrated and described Applicant's co-<br>
pending PCT International Applications PCT/IL01/00165 and PCT/IL01/00424.<br>
the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The personal cellular telecommunications devices can include a wide range<br>
of mobile handheld devices including inter alia simple phones, Smartphoncs,<br>
Communicators, Wireless Information Devices (WIDs), and the like. The client<br>
applications can be developed under different industry wide and proprietary<br>
development environments, and can run on different Operating Systems (O/Ss)<br>
including inter alia Microsoft CE, Symbian EPOC, Palm O/S, and the like.<br>

Detailed Description of the Drawings<br>
Figure 1 shows a GSM cellular telecommunications network 1 for<br>
displaying display messages on personal cellular telecommunications devices<br>
(hereinafter referred to as "devices ") 2. The network 1 includes a Cell Broadcast<br>
Controller (CBC) 3 for parsing a display message into PTMP broadcast messages<br>
to be broadcasted from one of two classes of Base Station Controller (BSC) 4,<br>
namely, non-macromessfge compliant BSCs 4A and macromessage compliant<br>
BSCs 4B. Each device 2 includes a host Mobile Equipment (ME) 6, and a<br>
resident Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card 7 capable of running SIM Toolkit<br>
applications (constituting client applications). Each bost ME 6 has its own unique <br>
vendor allocated 15 digit International Mobile Equipment Identification (IMEI)<br>
number 8, for example, 490548400308362. Each SIM 7 has a cellular operator<br>
allocated 15 digit International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) number 9, for<br>
example, 425010100437187. A device 2 can be either a non-macromessage<br>
compliant device 2A or a macromessage compliant device 2B, and its<br>
macromessage compliancy can be determined by way of a customization protocol<br>
employing either its IMEI or its IMSI, for example, as illustrated and described in<br>
Applicant's co-pending PCT International Applications PCT/IL01/00165 and<br>
PCT/IL01/00424, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br><br>
Figure 2 shows that a modified GSM-type PTMP broadcast message 11 is<br>
based on a conventional PTMP broadcast message having 88 bytes divided<br>
between a 6 byte header 12 and a 82 byte payload 13. The header 12 includes a<br>
macromessage identifier 14 for identifying a macromessage, a macromessage<br>
page field 16 for specifying an integer I of pages in a macromessage where K≥I≥1<br>
and K is a predetermined maximum number of PTMP broadcast messages in a<br>
macromessage (K=15 for a GSM-type macromessage), and a macromessage page<br>
counter 17 for specifying a page number J=(1, 2, ..., 1-1, I≤15) of a PTMP<br>
broadcast message in a macromessage. The value J is incremented by 1 for each<br>
consecutive PTMP broadcast message in a macromessage. The payload 13<br>
includes a reserved pseudo-header 18, and a payload remainder 19 for storing the<br>
actual content of an intended display message including inter alia display<br>
instructions, text, graphics, and the like. The pseudo-header 18 has a display<br>
message identifier 21 for identifying a display message, a PTMP broadcast<br>
message field 22 for specifying a value P≥1 of the number of PTMP broadcast<br>
messages required to transport an entire display message, and a PTMP broadcast<br>
message counter 23 Q-(l, 2	P-l, P) for specifying the location of a PTMP<br>
broadcast message in a sequence of P PTMP broadcast messages. The value Q is<br>
incremented by 1 for each consecutive PTMP broadcast message in a sequence of<br>
P PTMP broadcast messages. The pseudo-header 18 also includes a<br>
supermacromessage field 24 for specifying the number of macromessages L≥1<br>
required to transport an entire display message, and a supermacromessage counter<br>
26 M=(1, 2, ..., L-l, L) for specifying the location of a macromessage in a<br>
supermacromessage. The value M is incremented by 1 for each consecutive<br>
macromessage in a supermacromessage.<br>
The operation of the GSM mobile cellular telecommunications network 1<br>
is now described with reference to Figures 3-9 in respect of both non-<br>
macromessage compliant devices 2A and macromessage compliant devices 2B,<br>
and both non-macromessage compliant BSCs 4A and macromessage compliant<br>
BSCs 4B.<br><br>
In the case of either a BSC 4A or a BSC 4B, the CBC 3 initially<br>
determines the number P≥1 of PTMP broadcast messages required to transport an<br>
entire display message 27. In the case of a BSC 4A, the CBC 3 parses the display<br>
message 27 into P PTMP broadcast messages 28 including assigning values to<br>
its/their display message identifiers) 21, PTMP broadcast message field(s) 22<br>
and PTMP broadcast message counters) 23 prior to transmission at the BSC 4A<br>
for display of its/their originating display message 27 on a device 2A or 2B (see<br>
solid line in Figure 3, and Figure 4): The CBC 3 assigns the same identification<br>
number 123456 to its/their display message identificr(s) 21. The CBC 3 assigns<br>
the same value P to its/their PTMP broadcast message field(s) 22. The CBC 3<br>
assigns a value Q=(1, 2, 	 P-1, P) to its/their PTMP broadcast message<br>
counter(s) 23 where the value Q is incremented by 1 for each consecutive PTMP<br>
broadcast message 28 of the P PTMP broadcast mcssagc(s) 28. Also, the CBC 3<br>
can assign default values, say, L"M=0, to its/their supermacromessage field(s) 24<br>
and its/their supermacromessage counter(s) 26.<br>
In the case of a BSC 4B and P≤15, the CBC 3 and the BSC 4B parse the<br>
display message 27 into P≤15 PTMP broadcast messages 28 including assigning<br>
values to its/their macromessage identifier(s) 14, macromessage page field(s) 16,<br>
macroraessage page counter(s) 17, display message identifier(s) 21, PTMP<br>
broadcast message field(s) 22 and PTMP broadcast message counter(s) 23 prior to<br>
the P≤15 PTMP broadcast messages) 28 being ready for transmitting at the BSC<br>
4B for displaying its/their originating display message 29 on a device 2A or 2B<br>
(see hashed line in Figure 3, and Figure 5): The CBC 3 allocates the<br>
identification number 171717 for assigning to its/their macromessage identificr(s)<br>
14 by the BSC 4B. The BSC 4B assigns the same value I to its/their<br>
 macromcssagc page field(s) 16, and a value J to its/their macromessage page<br>
counter(s) 17. Typically, the 1 and Q values of its/their macromessage page<br>
 fieid(s) 13 and macromessage page counters(s) 17 arc the same as the P and Q<br>
values of their counterpart PTMP broadcast field(s) 22 and PTMP broadcast<br>
counter(s) 23, respectively. The CBC 3 assigns the same identification number<br><br>
232323 to its/their display message identifier(s) 21. The CBC 3 assigns the same<br>
value P to its/their PTMP broadcast message field(s) 22. The CBC 3 assigns a<br>
value Q-(1, 2	, P-l, P≤15) to its/their PTMP broadcast message counter(s) 23<br>
where Q is incremented by 1 for each consecutive P≤15 PTMP broadcast<br>
message 28 of the P≤15 PTMP broadcast message(s) 28. The CBC 3 can also<br>
assign default values, say, L=M=0, to its/their supcrmacromessagc ficld(s) 24 and<br>
its/their supcrmacromessagc counters) 26.<br>
In the case of a BSC 4B and P&gt;15, a decision has to be made whether to<br>
still utilize the BSC's macromessage capability or not. In the event that its<br>
macromessage capability is not to be utilized, then the display message is parsed<br>
into P&gt;15 PTMP broadcast messages in the same manner as in the case of a BSC<br>
4A prior to transmission at the BSC 4B for displaying their originating display<br>
message 27 on a device 2A or 2B.<br>
In the event that its macromessage capability is still to be utilized, the CBC<br>
3 determines the length of a supermacromessage in terms of the number L&gt;1 of<br>
macromessages required to transport the entire display message 27. The CBC 3<br>
and the BSC 4B parse the display message 27 into the P&gt;15 PTMP broadcast<br>
messages including assigning values to their macromessage identifiers 14,<br>
macromessage page fields 16, macromessage page counters 17, display message<br>
identifiers 21, PTMP broadcast message fields 22, PTMP broadcast message<br>
counters 23, supermacromessage fields 24, and supcrmacromessagc counters 26<br>
prior to transmission at the BSC 4B for displaying their originating display<br>
message 27 on a device 2A or 2B (see hashed line in Figure 3, and Figure 6): The<br>
CBC 3 allocates the identification numbers for the different macromessages for<br>
assigning to their macromessage identifiers 14 by the BSC 4B. For example,<br>
assuming- that P=25, the display message 27 is transportable by a<br>
supermacromessage consisting of two macromessages, the first macromessage<br>
being complete with 15 PTMP broadcast messages 28(1), ..., 28(15), and the<br>
second macroraessage having 10 PTMP broadcast messages 28(16), ..., 28(25).<br>
In the shown example, the CBC 3 allocates the value 454545 to the<br><br>
macromessage identifiers 14 of the 1st macromessage, and the value 474747 to the<br>
macromessage identifiers 14 of the 2nd macromessage.<br>
The BSC 4B assigns the value 1=15 to the macromessage page field 16 of<br>
each PTMP broadcast message of a complete macromessage, and the value I=P-<br>
[15x(L-1)] to the macromessage page field 16 of the last typically incomplete<br>
macromessage. The BSC 4B assigns a value J=(l, 2, ...., 15) to the<br>
macromessage page counters 17 of each PTMP broadcast message of a complete<br>
macromessage where the value J is incremented by 1 for each consecutive PTMP<br>
broadcast message of a macromessage, and the value J=(1,2,.... P-[15x(L-l)]) to<br>
the macromessage page counters 17 of the PTMP broadcast messages of the last<br>
typically incomplete macromessage. In the above example, the BSC 4B assigns<br>
the value 1=15 to the mscromessage page fields 16 of all IS PTMP broadcast<br>
messages 28 of the 1st macromessage, and a J-(l, 2, ..... 15) to their<br>
macromessage page counters 17. Also, the BSC 4B assigns the value I=10 to the<br>
macromessage page fields 21 of all 10 PTMP broadcast messages 28 of the 2nd<br>
macromessage, and a Q-(l, 2	10) to their macromessage page counters 17.<br>
The CBC 3 assigns the same identification number 123123 to the display<br>
message identifiers 21 of all 25 PTMP broadcast messages. The CBC 3 assigns<br>
the same value P to the PTMP broadcast message fields 21 of all 25 PTMP<br>
broadcast messages, and values Q-{1, 2,	, P-l, P) to their PTMP broadcast<br>
message counters 23 where the value Q is incremented by 1 for each consecutive<br>
PTMP broadcast message. The CBC 3 also assigns the same value L to the<br>
supermacromessage fields 24 of all 25 PTMP broadcast messages, and a value<br>
M=(l, 2, ..., L-1, L) to their supermacromessage counters 26 where M is<br>
incremented by 1 for each consecutive macromessage in a supermacromessage.<br>
In the above example, the CBC 3 assigns the value P=25 to the PTMP broadcast<br>
messages fields 22, the values Q=(l, 2, 	, 21, 25) to their PTMP broadcast<br>
message counters 23, the value L=2 to the supermacromessage fields 24 of all 25<br>
PTMP broadcast messages 28, the value M=l to the supermacromessage counters<br>
26 of the 15 PTMP broadcast messages of the 1st macromessage, and the value<br><br>
M=2 to the supermacromessage counters 26 of each of the 10 PTMP broadcast<br>
messages of the 2nd macromessage.<br>
A non-macromessagc compliant device 2A is, by definition, unable to<br>
interpret macromessage information contained in the header of a PTMP broadcast<br>
message and therefore as a consequence handles PTMP broadcast messages 11<br>
originating from either a BSC 4A or a BSC 4B in the same manner, namely, it<br>
processes the information stored in their pseudo-headers 18. In contrast, a<br>
macromessage compliant device 2B handles incoming PTMP broadcast messages<br>
originating from a BSC 4A and a BSC 4B differently.<br>
Turning to Figure 7, a device 2A receives incoming PTMP broadcast<br>
messages 11 which are individually automatically downloaded in their entirety to<br>
its SIM 7. The client application determines from its PTMP broadcast message<br>
field 22 whether a PTMP broadcast message is part of a single PTMP broadcast<br>
message (P=l) display message or a multi-PTMP broadcast message (P&gt;1)<br>
display message. In the former case, the client application strips off its header 12<br>
and its pseudo-header 18, and processes its payload remainder 19 for yielding the<br>
contents of the display message for display on the device 2A. In the latter case,<br>
the client application sorts the P PTMP broadcast messages of a display message<br>
into sequence by their PTMP broadcast message counters 23 and then processes<br>
their payload remainders 19 for yielding the contents of the display message for<br>
display on the device 2A. After a predetermined timeout, the client application<br>
discards any incomplete display messages.<br>
Turning to Figure 8, in the case of a device 2B receiving incoming PTMP<br>
broadcast messages, its ME 6 automatically attempts to process them by<br>
macromessage information potentially contained in their headers, namely, to<br>
order the PTMP broadcast messages of each macromessage in sequence. In the<br>
case of PTMP broadcast messages transmitted by a BSC 4A, since their headers<br>
are devoid of macromessage information, the ME 6 cannot process them and<br>
therefore they are individually downloaded to the SIM 7 as single PTMP<br>
broadcast message intermediate messages. Each such intermediate message is in<br><br>
actual fact identical to its originating PTMP broadcast message in the sense that it<br>
has an identical header and an identical payload.<br>
In the case of PTMP broadcast messages transmitted by a BSC 4B and<br>
therefore containing macromessage information, the ME 6 is able to process them<br>
to generate intermediate messages derived from one or more PTMP broadcast<br>
messages and up to 15 PTMP broadcast messages for downloading to the SIM 7.<br>
In the event that an intermediate message is derived from a single PTMP<br>
broadcast message (P=l) display message, its subsequent intermediate message is<br>
also identical to its originating PTMP broadcast message in the sense that it has<br>
an identical header and an identical payload. In the event that an intermediate<br>
message is derived from a multi-PTMP broadcast message display message, each<br>
such intermediate message has a header identical to the header of its first PTMP<br>
broadcast message, and a payload including the pseudo-header of its first PTMP<br>
broadcast message and its payload remainder, and the entire payloads of its<br>
remaining P-1 PTMP broadcast messages including their pseudo-headers spaced<br>
therealong at regular intervals. Figure 9 shows the intermediate message 29<br>
which would be yielded on receipt of the P≤15 PTMP broadcast messages 28<br>
derived from the display message 27 described hereinabove with reference to<br>
Figure 5. After a predetermined timeout, the ME 6 discards any incomplete<br>
macromessages.<br>
The client application determines whether an intermediate message is<br>
derived from a single PTMP broadcast message (Y=l) display message or a<br>
multi-PTMP broadcast message (Y&gt;1) display message. In the former case, such<br>
an intermediate message can be classified into one of three categories: Class 1 in<br>
the event it derives from a single PTMP broadcast message (P=l) display<br>
message, transmitted by either a BSC 4A or a BSC 4B. Class 2 in the event it<br>
derives from a multi-PTMP broadcast message (P&gt;1) display message transmitted<br>
by a BSC 4A. And Class 3 in the event it derives from a single PTMP broadcast<br>
message of a last incomplete macromessage of a two or more macromessage<br>
(L&gt;1) supermacromessage, for example, the 16th or the 31st PTMP broadcast<br><br>
message of a multi-PTMP broadcast message display message, transmitted by a<br>
BSC 4B.<br>
In the case that an intermediate message is derived from a single PTMP<br>
broadcast message (P=l) display message as determined from its PTMP<br>
broadcast message field 22, the client application strips off its header 12 and its<br>
pseudo-header 18, and processes its payload remainder 19 for yielding the<br>
contents of the display message for display on the device 2B. In the event that<br>
such an intermediate message is not derived from a single PTMP broadcast<br>
message (P=l) display message, it is necessary to determine from its<br>
supermacromessage field 24 whether it falls into cither Class 2 or 3. In the case<br>
that such an intermediate message falls into Class 2, it is processed in the same<br>
manner as described above with reference to a non-macromessage compliant<br>
device 2A, namely, the client application sorts the P PTMP broadcast messages of<br>
a multi-PTMP broadcast message (P&gt;1) display message into sequence by their<br>
PTMP broadcast message counters 23 and then processes their payload<br>
remainders 19 for yielding the contents of the display message for display on the<br>
device 2B.<br>
In the case that an intermediate message is derived from two or more<br>
PTMP broadcast messages indicative of their transmission by a BSC 4B, the<br>
client application determines from either the PTMP broadcast message field 22 or<br>
the supermacromessage field 24 of the first PTMP broadcast message whether it<br>
is derived from a single macromessage (P≤15) display message or a multi-<br>
macromessage (P&gt;15) display message. In the former case, the client application<br>
strips off the header 12 and the pseudo-headers 18 of the PTMP broadcast<br>
messages before processing the payload remainders 19 of all the PTMP broadcast<br>
messages of the intermediate message for yielding the content of the display<br>
message for display on the device 2B. In the latter case, the client application<br>
treats the intermediate message in the same manner as described for the former<br>
case that a PTMP broadcast message is derived from a single macromessage<br>
(P≤15) display message but it concatenates the two or more macromessages of a<br><br>
supermacromessage including a single FTMP broadcast message (Y=l)<br>
macromessage derived from a Class 3 intermediate message as identified by their<br>
display message identifiers 21 in sequence prior to displaying the display message<br>
on the device 2B.<br>
In the case of a display message being transmitted by a macromessage<br>
compliant BSC 4B for display on a device 2B, the concatenation of the PTMP<br>
broadcast messages of a macromessage is transparent to the device 2B, and<br>
therefore support of a supermacromessage capability is in practice equivalent to<br>
support of the concatenation of PTMP broadcast messages on a non-<br>
macromessage compliant device 2A. To this end, each macromessage requires<br>
that only its first PTMP broadcast message 31 (see Figure 10) has the pseudo-<br>
header 18 with the display message identifier 21, the supermacromessage field 24<br>
and the supermacromessage counter 26 whilst its other up to 14 PTMP broadcast<br>
messages may have full 82 byte payloads.<br>
The operation of a GSM mobile telecommunications network 1 having<br>
only macromessage compliant devices 2B and macromessage compliant BSCs<br>
4B is now described with reference to Figures 11 and 12. A CBC 3 initially<br>
determines the number L≥1 of macromessages required to transport an entire<br>
display message 27, and thereafter, the CBC 3 and a BSC 4B parse the display<br>
message 27 in the same manner as described hereinabove in connection with<br>
Figure 6 without the assigning of values to the display message identifiers 21, the<br>
PTMP broadcast message fields 22 and the PTMP broadcast message counters of<br>
the 2nd and up to 15th PTMP broadcast message of each macromessage which are<br>
absent. On receiving incoming PTMP broadcast messages, the ME 6 of a device<br>
2B automatically processes them by the macromessage information contained in<br>
their headers 12 to sort the PTMP broadcast messages of each macromessage.<br>
The ME 6 downloads intermediate messages which are derived from cither a<br>
single macromessage (L=l) supermacromessage or a multi-macromessage (L&gt;1)<br>
supermacromessage. Each intermediate message may contain from a single<br>
PTMP broadcast message up to 15 PTMP broadcast messages, and includes the<br><br>
header of the 1st PTMP broadcast message, and its payload including its pseudo-<br>
header 18 and its payload remainder 19, and the full payloads of any additional<br>
PTMP broadcast messages. In the case that an intermediate message is derived<br>
from a single macromessage supermacromessage, the client application strips off<br>
the header 12 and the pseudo-header 18 of its first PTMP broadcast message for<br>
yielding the content of the display message for display on the device 2B. In the<br>
case that an intermediate message is derived from a multi-macromessage<br>
supermacromessage, the client application concatenates the two or more<br>
macromessages as identified by their display message identifiers 21 in sequence<br>
prior to displaying the display message on the device 2B.<br>
While the invention has been described with respect to a limited number<br>
of embodiments, it will be appreciated that many variations, modifications, and<br>
other applications of the invention can be made within the scope of the appended<br>
claims. For example, alternative means instead can be provided for enabling a<br>
personal cellular telecommunications device to determine the receipt of a<br>
complete display message or a complete supermacromessage. Thus, rather than<br>
providing each PTMP broadcast message with a PTMP broadcast message field<br>
22, an end of display message symbol (constituting a complete display message<br>
indication means) can be employed in which case each PTMP broadcast message<br>
32 for transporting a display message except the last would have the PTMP<br>
broadcast message counter 23 (see Figure 13A) whilst the last PTMP broadcast<br>
message 33 for transporting a display message would have the PTMP broadcast<br>
message counter 23 and an end of display message symbol 34 (see Figure 13B).<br>
The same approach may also be applied to supermacromessage information.<br><br>
