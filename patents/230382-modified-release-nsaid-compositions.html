(See Section 10 and Rule 13)<br><br>
"MODIFIED RELEASE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS"<br>
Themis Laboratories Pvt. Ltd. having its administrative office at Unit No. S - 4 , Khira Industrial Estate, B.M Bhargava Road, Santacruz West, Mumbai 400054, Maharashtra, India an Indian Company<br>
The following specification describes ttie invention.<br><br><br>
1 1 SEP 2006<br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to modified release pharmaceutical compositions in the form of capsule, tablet, granules or pellets and process for producing these compositions containing a non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) such as Aceclofenac as first <br>
5     	active ingredient.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
NSAIDs are used for chronic as well as acute symptoms. Treatment with NSAIDs in conventional dosage forms is not generally tolerable due to severe gastric irritation,<br>
10 nausea, vomiting and related undesirable effects. Release of NSAIDs in the stomach is considered responsible for such gastric discomfort in patients. Conventional dosage forms for administration of NSAIDs have serious problems. These are immediate release of the active followed by sub-minimal concentrations of the drug with time, requiring the patient to take multiple dosages in a day, which in turn further aggravates the problems due to<br>
15    repeated gastric irritation.<br>
Previous attempts to provide controlled release formulations in the form of monolithic systems to modulate the NSAID release suffer from a few serious drawbacks. Accidental or intentional rupture of delivery system leads to dose dumping. Dose dumping can have toxic or fatal effects depending upon the active ingredient involved. Gastric<br>
20 emptying of monolithic system is variable. It depends on many factors like presence or absence of food, type of food, physiological state, disease condition, posture etc. It ultimately results into more of localized release of NSAID and is indeed not a dosage form of a choice.<br>
Therefore, there is a need to have more reliable alternative dosage form and a<br>
25    process to produce such dosage form.<br>
Such alternative dosage form containing active, comprises multiple smaller particles formulated with modified release characteristics. These multiple smaller particles are formulated into dosage form like capsule or tablet or are alternatively accommodated in sachet. Multiple unit system has distinct advantages over single unit system especially in<br>
30    case of modified release systems.<br>
1)	Multiple unit system when administered gets distributed throughout the Gl tract thereby avoiding localized accumulation and local irritation.<br>
2)	Minimized inter and intra subject variation.<br>
3)	Incorporation of 2 or more drugs in a single dosage form.<br>
35    4) Allows delivery of particles or small units having different release characteristics to achieve desired release profile.<br>
2<br><br>
5) Allows preparation of multi-dose formulation without any change in process or formulation.<br>
Problem of rupturing of small particles is resolved by imparting a protective coat if<br>
             required. Such coat allows further processing of these small particles.<br>
5	US 5,800,836 disclose a pelletized sustained release pharmaceutical composition<br>
with enteric coat and has enteric and water insoluble polymers. The core coating being such that the active ingredient is released in a controlled fashion over an extended period in the intestine but substantially no release occurs in the acid environment of the stomach. Use of enteric polymer is critical to the tune of 70% of the total weight of polymers used.<br>
10	US 6531152, US 6632451 and US5840332 disclose device for immediate localized<br>
release of active that comprises a drug in combination with a swellable core material that carries enteric coat. The coating comprises a material that is not soluble, or minimally soluble, in aqueous solution, within which material, a hydrophilic, non-water-soluble, particulate is embedded.  The essential feature of the coating  is a relatively rigid<br>
15 hydrophobic polymer that contains in it water insoluble hydrophilic particles which when in contact with water swell and form channel to connect core with surroundings outside the coat. This causes swelling of core leading to bursting of coat.<br>
US6599529 has two separate factions or two different types of units; one for immediate release where an antacid or alkaline portion is present and another for<br>
20 sustained release purposes comprising units coated with substantially pH-independent water-insoluble, but water-diffusible coat. It is a unit dosage form comprising at least two NSAID-containing fractions, i) a first NSAID-containing fraction of multiple-units for quick release of the NSAID substance, and ii) a second NSAID-containing fraction of multiple-units for extended release of the NSAID substance, the first fraction which - when<br>
25 subjected to dissolution method II employing 0.07 N HCI as dissolution medium - releases at least 50% w/w of the NSAID substance present in the fraction within the first 20 min of the test, the second fraction being in the form of coated delayed release multiple units for extended release of the NSAID substance.<br>
US6312728 teaches a sustained release formulation having an enteric coat.<br>
30	US4713248 discloses a water based film comprising a homogeneous combination<br>
of water dispersible film forming agent and a polymeric substance that forms a film over a controlled release multiple release formulation containing a active substance but the release in first hour is not less than 23% of active and in case of NSAID, it will cause a great irritation.<br>
35	Prior art has following approaches for providing sustained release compositions<br>
comprising of NSAIDs:<br>
3<br><br>
1)	Make use of antacids;<br>
2)	Provide an immediate fraction and a sustained release faction;<br>
3)	Provide a matrix of one or more polymers for sustained release formulation;<br>
4)	Provide a formulation comprising of enteric coat to regulate the release.<br>
5	These approaches provide for release of active in stomach and subsequent<br>
maintenance of levels and have drawbacks. For example use of antacids changes the pH profile locally which is highly undesirable. Active change in gastric fluid composition should be construed as intentionally altering the constitution by introduction of additional ingredient. For example in some patents an antacid layer is given around the active. Such <br>
10 	an antacid is an additional moiety that would alter pH to a greater extent and may therefore jeopardize aspects of absorption of some of the other ingredients.<br>
Many options indicate use of two types of particles of which one providing<br>
immediate release ensures gastric irritation. Some compositions though do not have two<br>
types of particles but contain active in such a way that on administration, there is<br>
15    immediate release. These approaches do not solve the problems associated with NSAIDs<br>
like local irritation, gastric discomfort as indicated earlier in the document.<br>
Therefore there is a long standing need to develop a process and composition that does not have enteric coat, yet exhibiting modified release over a period of at least 7 hours such that Not more than (NMT) 10%w/w of active is released in acidic medium in 1 <br>
20    	hour.<br>

The present invention provides a delayed modified release pharmaceutical composition comprising NSAID that releases active for a prolonged period. The compositions of the present invention are processed in such a way that though devoid of enteric polymer, release not more than 10% of active in acidic pH in vitro in 1 hour. This is<br>
15 significantly different from prior art where presence of enteric polymer is must for arresting release of NSAID in acidic medium. Coating equipments like coating pan, fluid bed processors, extrusion and spheronizer, centrifugal coater, tangential coater can be used.<br>
This invention provides a means to release in one hour not more than 10% of first active ingredient at pH of 1.5 in vitro and to release in 1 hour, 4 hours, 7 hours NLT 15%<br>
20 w/w, 40-85%w/w and NLT 60%w/w of first active in buffer of pH 6.8, comprising a core, comprising non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug such as Aceclofenac in an amount from 30-80%w/w of composition as first active ingredient; a barrier coat, comprising at least one non-enteric water insoluble polymer upto 25%w/w of composition and at least one channel forming agent.<br>
25	The objects of the invention are achieved by preparing and providing modified<br>
release solid oral dosage forms without the use of enteric polymer as described below in following steps:<br>
Step 1) Preparation of drug core Step 2) Application of optional coat<br>

STEP 1) Preparation of Drug Core:<br>
The first step is preparation of drug core by depositing on inert seeds, non-steroidal<br>
anti-inflammatory drug such as Aceclofenac 30-80%w/w of composition as first active<br>
35    ingredient using binder, optionally with other pharmaceutical^ acceptable ingredients to<br>
obtain drug cores. Such deposition of NSAID can be simultaneous with binder or<br>
6<br><br>
alternating with binder. Binder may be in the form of aqueous or non-aqueous solution or dispersion.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention the drug cores can be prepared by extruding and spheronizing NSAID with pharmaceutically acceptable ingredients. <br>
