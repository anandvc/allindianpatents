				<td>CONTAINER-CLOSURE ARRANGEMENT<br>
Technical Field<br>
An improved container-closure arrangement is disclosed, for example, an<br>
arrangement wherein at least the closure (eg. lid) is moulded from plastic.<br>
Background Art<br>
Plastic and metal containers such as pails are used for holding chemicals<br>
including paints, solvents, oils, powders etc. It is desirable that the closure does not<br>
become detached from the container as a result of inadvertent dropping of the container<br>
and/or from shifting loads during handling, transport etc. At the same time, it is<br>
desirable that the closure be readily removable when access to container contents is<br>
required.<br>
There is provided a first container-closure arrangement comprising:<br>
(i) a container having a base and peripheral wall, a rim forming an upper margin of the<br>
wall and surrounding an opening of the container, an external bead formed integrally<br>
with and surrounding the rim, and an internal bead formed integrally with and around<br>
the rim to project inwardly of the container; and<br>
(ii) a closure having a closure portion that is adapted to overlie the opening of the<br>
container, a skirt formed integrally with the closure portion and arranged to surround<br>
the rim when the closure is mounted to the container, the skirt comprising a first portion<br>
positionable adjacent to and to surround an external upper end of the rim, and a second<br>
portion comprising a band that is frangibly connected to and extends downwardly from<br>
the first portion to surround the rim below its upper end, the second portion having a<br>
first ledge located within and formed integrally therewith, the first ledge being<br>
positionable to locate in interlocking engagement with the external bead, with a second<br>
ledge being formed integrally with the closure portion and being positionable to locate<br>
hi interlocking engagement with the internal bead;<br>
wherein, when the closure is mounted on the container, the second portion can<br>
be detached from the first portion to enable its removal from the closure and from its<br>
interlocking engagement with the external bead.<br>
The interlocking engagement of the first ledge with the external bead can<br>
provide a "primary locking" of the closure to the container, and the interlocking<br>
engagement of the second ledge with the internal bead can provide a "secondary<br>
locking" of the closure to the container. Detachment of the second portion thus releases<br>
this primary locking to allow for closure removal from the container.<br>
In this regard, once the primary locking has been disengaged, only the secondary<br>
locking needs to be disengaged for the closure to be removed from the container. In<br>
other words, once the second portion has been detached from the first portion the<br>
second ledge can be disengaged from the internal bead to release the closure from the<br>
container. Thereafter, upon closure re-mounting to the container, secondary locking can<br>
be re-engaged (via the second ledge and internal bead) to securely remount the closure<br>
to the container.<br>
The second portion can thus function as a tear baud or strip, and this band or<br>
strip can provide an indication that the mounting of the closure to the container lias been<br>
tampered with. Alternatively, the frangible connection between the first and second<br>
portions can be defined by a line of severance (eg. that can be readily cut with a knife,<br>
blade etc), and again, tampering with the line of severance can be detected.<br>
hi addition, for transport, storage etc, the provision of primary and secondary<br>
locking facilitates a more secure mounting of the closure to the container such that,<br>
when the closure is initially mounted on the container, it is secured thereto on either<br>
side of the rim.<br>
In one embodiment a closure flange can be formed integrally with and to extend<br>
out from the skirt of the closure to facilitate closure removal from the container. In this<br>
embodiment, the closure flange can be formed integrally with to extend out from the<br>
first portion. Thus, once the second portion has been detached from the first portion, the<br>
second ledge can disengaged from die internal bead by lifting the closure flange. This<br>
can cause an outward flexing of the first portion away from the rim and can allow the<br>
second ledge to move past the internal bead.<br>
In another embodiment the second portion can have a thickness that causes the<br>
first ledge to be urged into interlocking engagement with the external bead after the first<br>
ledge has moved past the external bead during mounting of the closure to the container.<br>
In this regard, the first ledge can sit under and/or behind the external bead.<br>
In a further embodiment a container flange can be formed integrally with and to<br>
extend out from the container wall below the rim. In this regard, a distal end of the skirt<br>
second portion may be positionable adjacent to the container flange when the closure is<br>
mounted to the container. Locating the distal end of the second portion adjacent to the<br>
container flange can assist with tamper proofing the arrangement The container flange<br>
can also function to strengthen the container.<br>
In combination with the external bead, the container flange can define an<br>
external channel extending around the rim and into which the first ledge can be received<br>
when the closure is mounted to the container. In addition, the container flange can be<br>
formed to protrude laterally further from the container than the skirt, thereby providing<br>
protection to the skirt during transport of the arrangement.<br>
In yet another embodiment the closure portion can comprise a land that connects<br>
at one end to the skirt, and from which end the skirt depends, and connects at an<br>
i<br>
opposite end to a wall section that subtends from this opposite end. The skirt, land and<br>
wall section in combination can define a generally U-shaped channel into which the<br>
container rim is receivable, when mounting the closure thereto. The first and second<br>
ledges may then project into the U-shaped channel from the skirt and wall section<br>
respectively.<br>
In a further embodiment the second ledge may project into the U-shaped channel<br>
from the land and, additionally, an internal skirt can project from the land or wall<br>
section, with a distal end of the internal skirt being arranged for engagement with an<br>
internal ledge defined in the container wall. The internal skirt can provide support for<br>
the stacking of containers. For example, when a laden second container is stacked on<br>
top of an assembled first container-closure arrangement, the internal skirt can transfer<br>
the mass of the second container from the first closure to the first container wall.<br>
In yet a further embodiment, a sealing arrangement can be provided between the<br>
first portion and the adjacent container rim. This sealing arrangement can comprise a<br>
projection on either the first portion or the rim, and a corresponding recess on either the<br>
rim or the first portion respectively, the recess being adapted for receiving the<br>
projection therein when the closure is mounted to the container. The projection can be<br>
received in the recess in a close or snug fit to maximise sealing between the closure and<br>
the container.<br>
There is also provided a second container-closure arrangement comprising:<br>
(i) a container having a base and peripheral wall, a rim forming an upper margin of the<br>
wall and surrounding an opening of the container, an external bead formed integrally<br>
with, surrounding and spaced from a free end of the rim, and an internal bead formed<br>
integrally with and around the rim to project inwardly of the container, the internal bead<br>
being defined as part of the rim free end; and<br>
(ii) a closure having a closure portion that is adapted to overlie the opening of the<br>
container, a skirt formed integrally with the closure portion and arranged to surround<br>
the rim when the closure is mounted to the container, the skirt having a first ledge<br>
located within and formed integrally therewith, the first ledge being positionable to<br>
locate in interlocking engagement with the external bead, with a second ledge being<br>
formed integrally with the closure portion and being positionable to locate in<br>
interlocking engagement with the internal bead.<br>
By locating the external bead such that is spaced from the rim free end, and by<br>
defining the internal bead as part of the rim free end, once the first ledge is disengaged<br>
from the external bead, this arrangement makes it easier to disengage the second ledge<br>
from the internal bead.<br>
In an embodiment of the second arrangement the skirt comprises first and<br>
second portions as defined in the first arrangement (eg. where me second portion<br>
comprises a band that is frangibly connected to and extends downwardly from the first<br>
portion to surround the rim below its upper end).<br>
In all other respects the second arrangement may be as defined in the first<br>
arrangement.<br>
There is also provided a third container-closure arrangement comprising:<br>
(i) a container having a base and peripheral wall, a rim forming an upper margin of the<br>
wall and surrounding an opening of the container, an external bead formed integrally<br>
with and surrounding the rim, and a container flange formed integrally with and to<br>
extend out from and around the container wall below the rim; and<br>
(ii) a closure having a closure portion that is adapted to overlie the opening of the<br>
container, a skirt formed integrally with the closure portion and arranged to surround<br>
the rim when the closure is mounted to the container, the skirt comprising a first portion<br>
positionable. adjacent to and to surround an external upper end of the rim, and a second<br>
portion comprising a band that is frangibly connected to and extends downwardly from<br>
the first portion to surround the rim below its upper end, the second portion having a<br>
first ledge located within and formed integrally therewith, the first ledge being<br>
positionable to locate in interlocking engagement with the external bead;<br>
wherein, when the closure is mounted on the container, a distal end of the<br>
second portion is positioned in a close facing relationship to the container flange.<br>
By arranging for the distal end of the second portion to be in a close facing<br>
relationship to the container flange when the closure is mounted on the container, an<br>
additional tamper proof feature can be provided. For example, an attempt to remove the<br>
closure from the container may require the insertion of an implement (eg. a blade)<br>
between the second portion distal end and the container flange, which may then be<br>
detected (eg. as a deformation of either of both of the second portion or flange).<br>
The terminology "close facing relationship" is to be interpreted to include<br>
abutment of the second portion distal end at the container flange.<br>
In the third arrangement the container flange may comprise the features of and<br>
be defined by the container flange of the first arrangement.<br>
In the third arrangement the container can comprise an internal bead formed<br>
integrally with and around the rim to project inwardly of the container, and the closure<br>
portion can comprise a second ledge formed integrally therewith and positionable to<br>
locate in interlocking engagement with the internal bead, as defined in the first<br>
arrangement.<br>
In addition, in the third arrangement the second portion can be detached from<br>
the first portion to enable its removal from the closure and from its interlocking<br>
engagement with the external bead, as defined in the first arrangement.<br>
In all other respects the third arrangement may be as defined in the first<br>
arrangement.<br>
Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
Notwithstanding other embodiments which may incorporate some or all of the<br>
features as outlined in the Summary, a number of specific container-closure<br>
embodiments will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings in winch:<br>
Figure 1 shows a perspective view of an assembled container-closure<br>
arrangement;<br>
Figure 2 shows a side sectional view through part of the assembled container6<br>
closure arrangement taken on the line 2,3 - 2,3 of Figure 1; and<br>
Figure 3 shows a side sectional view through part of another assembled<br>
container-closure arrangement taken on the line 2,3 - 2,3 of Figure 1.<br>
Detailed Description of Specific Embodiments<br>
Referring to Figures 1 to 3, where like reference numerals are used to denote<br>
similar or like parts, two container-closure arrangement embodiments (Figures 2 and 3)<br>
will now be described. Each arrangement generally comprises a container in the form of<br>
a pail 10, and a closure in the form of a lid 11. Whilst the arrangements can be<br>
employed with a circular pail and lid as shown, the arrangements are equally applicable<br>
to square or rectangular pails and lids etc.<br>
The pail and lid may be moulded from polypropylene or high density<br>
polyethylene. The pail may be moulded in any desired size and may have a volumetric<br>
capacity in the order of eg. 0.5 to 10 litres. The pail may also be formed from a metal<br>
material. In addition, the lid-pail arrangements are suited to both straight-sided (Figure<br>
2) and angle-walled (Figure 3) containers.<br>
The pail 10 has a base 13 which is sized so that it can be located at a closure<br>
portion of the lid. hi this regard, the closure portion includes a generally flat central<br>
region 14, whereby the base of an overlying pail can be positioned on region 14, so that<br>
a number of the pail-lid arrangements may be stacked one upon another. The pail has a<br>
peripheral wall 15, and a rim 16 forms an upper margin of the wall 15 and surrounds an<br>
opening of the pail.<br>
An externally projecting bead 17 is formed integrally with and surrounds the<br>
rim 16, and is spaced from an upper free end 16A of the rim. The bead 17 has an<br>
undersurface 18 that extends from the outer surface 19 of the peripheral wall 15.<br>
An internally projecting bead 20 is formed integrally with and extends<br>
internally of and around the rim 16, the bead 20 being defined as part of the rim upper<br>
free end 16A. The bead 20 has an undersurface 21 that extends from the inner surface<br>
22 of the peripheral wall 15.<br>
The spacing of the beads as shown, and the incorporation of bead 20 into rim<br>
upper free end 16A, makes it easier for the lid 11 to removed from container 10 (as<br>
described below).<br>
An annular container flange 24 can be formed integrally with to surround the<br>
peripheral wall 15 of the container. The flange is located below the level of the bead 17<br>
to define a circumferential groove 25 for the receipt of a skirt ledge (as described<br>
below). The flange may comprise a first wall portion 26 formed integrally with, and<br>
surrounding and extending out from the outer surface 19 of the peripheral wall 15, and a<br>
second wall portion 27 subtending from the first wall portion 26. The wall portion 26<br>
may be slightly inclined with respect to the peripheral wall 15 of the container or may<br>
be generally orthogonal thereto.<br>
The flange 24 can provide for a tamper-proof mounting of the lid to the pail (as<br>
described below). The flange 24 also strengthens the pail and provides resistance to<br>
lateral bumps and blows during transportation. In this regard, as best shown in Figures<br>
2 and 3, because flange 24 projects laterally further than the lid, it preferentially<br>
receives and absorbs bumps, blows etc. and thus contributes to a secure lid mounting in<br>
use.<br>
The lid 11 comprises a skirt 30 which surrounds the rim 16 when the lid is first<br>
mounted to the pail. Skirt 30 can comprise first 32 and second 34 skirt portions, with the<br>
second skirt portion typically being defined as a removable tear strip or band. Whilst the<br>
skirt may be formed as a continuous (unbroken) wall depending from and extending<br>
peripherally around the lid (eg. for permanent lid locking to the pail, such as where the<br>
arrangement is employed on oil cans etc and a separate spout is employed with the lid),<br>
in most applications it is configured to be removable to readily enable lid opening. In<br>
this regard, a free strip end 34 A (Figure 1) can be defined as part of second skirt portion<br>
34, the free strip end 34A providing a manually accessible point of initiation for strip <br>
tearing and removal. The strip end 34A may be moulded or formed so as to protrude<br>
slightly for easier access. Alternatively, at a location along the second skirt portion 34,<br>
the skirt portion may be thinned out, indented or cut to facilitate initiation of tear strip<br>
removal.<br>
To assist with tamper-proofing the mounting of the lid to the pail, the second<br>
skirt portion 34 may be shaped and sized to extend down to the flange 24 in a close<br>
facing relationship with wall portion 26 when the lid is first mounted to the pail (see<br>
Figures 2 and 3). This close facing relationship (eg. may be abutment) provides a<br>
tamper-proof region between the lid and pail and can help to prevent the insertion of a<br>
knife or other sharp or bladed instrument between the lid and pail. However, should<br>
such an attempt be made, the close facing relationship ensures that deformation or other<br>
damage results, thereby providing a visual or tactile indication of tampering.<br>
The first skirt portion 32 is connected to the central region 14 by a land in the<br>
form of annular bridging web 35, internal wall 36 and connecting web 37. The web 35<br>
and wall 36 combine with the first skirt portion 32 to define an inverted U-shaped<br>
channel located adjacent to the central region 14 and into which the rim 16 is received<br>
when the lid is mounted to the pail.<br>
The second skirt portion 34 depends from and is frangibly connected to the<br>
skirt portion 32 by way of an integrally moulded thin connecting web 38. Alternatively,<br>
web 38 can be defined by a line of severance between the first and second skirt portions<br>
which can eg. be cut with a knife or separately torn off etc.<br>
hi both the embodiments of Figures 2 and 3, the second skirt portion comprises<br>
an inwardly projecting ledge 40 for interlocking engagement with the bead 17 when the<br>
lid is first mounted to the pail as shown. In the embodiment of Figure 2, the internal<br>
wall 36 comprises an inwardly projecting ledge 42 for interlocking engagement with the<br>
bead 20 when the lid is mounted to the pail as shown. In the embodiment of Figure 3,<br>
the web 35 comprises an inwardly projecting ridge 42' (instead of ledge 42) for<br>
interlocking engagement with the bead 20 when the lid is mounted to the pail as shown.<br>
The dual interlocking engagement between beads 17,20 and ledges 40,42<br>
enables the lid to be securely fastened to the pail in that, once assembled, the lid is<br>
secured around its periphery by locking on to beads on either side of the rim 16, with<br>
the rim then being locked within the U-shaped channel. Furthermore, the interlocking<br>
engagement of the ledge 40 with the bead 17 provides a "primary" locking of the<br>
closure to the container. The reference to "primary" is a reference to an interlocking<br>
which externally secures the lid to the pail during transportation and prior to accessing<br>
container contents. The interlocking engagement of the ledge/ridge 42,42' with the bead<br>
20 is referred to as "secondary" locking of the lid to the pail, and this locking enables<br>
the lid to be re-secured to the pail after the pail contents have been accessed.<br>
For example, when the second skirt portion 34 is provided as a removable strip<br>
that is severable along web 38, removal of portion 34 facilitates detachment of the lid<br>
from the pail, hi addition, because bead 20 is defined as part of rim upper free end 16 A,<br>
once portion 34 has been removed, it is now relatively easy to detach the lid at<br>
ledge/ridge 42,42' from bead 20 and remove it from container 10. In this regard, after<br>
removal of portion 34, and when the lid 11 is then lifted, ledge/ridge 42,42' can be<br>
easily urged past bead 20, as ridge 16 can deflect outwardly because first skirt portion<br>
can now be flexed or urged outwardly.<br>
The first skirt portion 32 may also comprise a flange for the lid in the form of a<br>
projection 44 extending outwardly from and around the lid. The projection 44 is<br>
profiled to accommodate the fingers of a person who seeks to lift the lid from the pail<br>
after the second skirt portion 34 has been removed. This lifting may instead be<br>
facilitated by an appropriate tool. In. either case, lifting of projection 44 can further<br>
promote the outward flexing/urging of the first skirt portion, to further assist with<br>
detachment of ledge/ridge 42,42' from rim 16 and bead 20.<br>
As Shown, the second skirt portion 34 has a thickness sufficient to cause the<br>
ledge 40 to be urged under (or behind) the bead 17 (ie. in a kind of snap-lock) once the<br>
ledge has moved past the bead during mounting of the lid to the pail. In this regard, the<br>
thickness and/or skirt material is selected to allow deformation of the second skirt<br>
portion during movement past the bead 17, but to impart sufficient resilience to cause<br>
the skirt portion to spring back to its original dimension once in the location shown in<br>
Figures 1 to 3.<br>
The beads 17,20 are typically shaped to facilitate sliding engagement between<br>
respective inside surfaces 46 and 47 of the second and first skirt portions and a surface<br>
48 of the internal wall 36 (embodiment of Figure 2) when the lid is mounted to the pail.<br>
In this regard, mounting of the lid to the pail may be facilitated by arranging a<br>
ring-shaped tool on projection 44. The tool can have an internal diameter such that it<br>
sits on projection 44 and abuts a wall portion 35A of the lid, with wall portion 35 A<br>
extending from web 35 and connecting it to projection 44. A user (or machine) may<br>
then press on the ring-shaped tool to force the lid onto the pail, with inside surfaces 46<br>
and 47 sliding past bead 17, and (in the embodiment of Figure 2) with surface 46 sliding<br>
past bead 20.<br>
As shown in both Figures 2 and 3, projection 44 and web 35 are connected by<br>
the wall portion 35A such that a peripheral flange 50, protruding from the intersection<br>
of base 13 and wall 15 of an overlying pail 10', can be accommodated as shown. This<br>
configuration enables secure stacking of such pails.<br>
Referring specifically to Figure 3, it will be seen that a lid stacking skirt 52 can<br>
be provided to extend from an underside of lid 11. The skirt can extend from the<br>
annular bridging web 35 (as shown), or may extend from the internal wall 36 or from<br>
the connecting web 37. A distal end 52A of the stacking skirt 52 can, when the h'd is<br>
mounted to the pail, be received at an internal step 54 defined in wall 15 of container<br>
10. Thus, when one or more laden (eg. like) containers are stacked on the lid 11, the<br>
stacldng skirt 52 can receive the mass of the laden containers) and transfer it to the step<br>
in the container wall, and the wall then transfers this mass to its base. This can prevent<br>
inward collapse of the lid under load.<br>
Referring specifically to Figure 3 again, it will also be seen that a sealing<br>
arrangement between the lid and pail can be employed. In this regard, the sealing<br>
arrangement may comprise one or more projections in the form of one or more discrete<br>
lobes 56 or a peripheral bead 56 located on (eg. integral with) the rim 16. The sealing<br>
arrangement may then farther comprise one or more corresponding recesses 58 or a<br>
peripheral groove 58 respectively, each recess or the groove being defined in the first<br>
skirt portion 32 and being adapted for receiving each lobe or the bead respectively<br>
therein when the lid is mounted to the pail. Alternatively, each lobe or bead may be<br>
located at the first skirt portion 32 and each recess or the groove may be located at the<br>
rim 16. In addition, each recess or the groove and each lobe or the bead can be sized<br>
such that, when engaged together, a close or snug fit results. This can farther enhance<br>
sealing.<br>
The sealing arrangement thus provides a seal between the lid and pail, and may<br>
in this regard also be adapted such that a gasket can be provided thereat for eg. hermetic<br>
or additional air-tight sealing of pail contents. The sealing arrangement also provides<br>
for an additional fastening of Hie first skirt portion 32 to the rim 16 (ie. once second<br>
skirt portion 34 has been removed). As required, the arrangement can be adapted to<br>
provide eg. a reduced primary locking force, ie. once skirt portion 34 has been removed.<br>
In use, after the container has been filled and the lid has been mounted to the<br>
pail, when a user requires access to the pail contents, the second skirt portion 34 is<br>
removed (eg. as a tear strip) to detach ledge 40 from bead 17. This releases the lid from<br>
its primary locking position. Then the user by hand or through the use of an appropriate<br>
tool engages projection 44 and lifts it away from the pail to detach ledge/ridge 42,42'<br>
from bead 20 and effectively peal back the lid 11 from pail 10, allowing access to pail<br>
contents. After such access the lid can be re-mounted by pushing it back on to the pail<br>
until ledge/ridge 42,42' interlockingly engages with bead 20, thus re-sealing the pail<br>
contents for storage and later use.<br>
In the embodiments described the lid is formed from deformable and/or<br>
deflectable materials to facilitate its mounting onto and removal from the pail. On the<br>
other hand, and as required, the pail may be formed from deformable or non-deformable<br>
materials such as plastic, metal etc.<br>
Whilst a number of embodiments have been described, it will be appreciated<br>
that the container-closure arrangement can be embodied in many other forms.<br><br><br>
We claim:<br>
1.	A container-closure arrangement comprising:<br>
(i) a container (10) having a base (13), and peripheral wall (15), a rim (16) forming an upper margin of the wall (15) and surrounding an opening of the container (10), an external bead (17) formed integrally with and around the rim (16) to project inwardly of the container (10), and<br>
(ii) a closure (11) having a closure portion that is adapted to overlie the opening of the container (10), a skirt (30) formed integrally with the closure portion and arranged to surround the rim (16) when the closure (11) is fitted to the container (10), the skirt (30) comprising a first portion (32) positionable adjacent to and to surround an external upper end of the rim (16A). and a second portion (34) comprising a band that is frangibly connected to and extends downwardly from the first portion (32) to surround the rim (16) below its upper end (16A), the second portion (34) having a first ledge (40) located within and formed integrally therewith, the first ledge (40) being positionable to locate in interlocking engagement with the external bead (17), with a second ledge (42) being formed integrally with the closure portion and being positionable to locate in interlocking engagement with the internal bead (20);<br>
wherein, once the closure (11) is mounted on the container (10), the second portion (34) is detachable from the first portion (32) to enable its removal from the closure (11) and from its interlocking engagement with the external bead (17).<br>
2.	A container-closure arrangement as claimed in claim 1 wherein a container flange (24) is formed integrally with and extends out from the skirt first portion (32) such that, once the skirt second portion (34) has been detached from the skirt first portion (32), the second ledge (42) is disengageable from the internal bead (20) by lifting the closure flange (24) away from the rim (16).<br>
3.	A container-closure arrangement as claimed in claim 1 or 2 wherein a container flange (24) is formed integrally with and extends out from the container wall (15) below the rim (16), whereby a distal end (34A) of the skirt second portion (34) is positionable in a close facing relationship to the container flange (24) when the closure (11) is mounted to the container (10).<br><br>
4.	A container-closure arrangement as claimed in claim 3 wherein the container flange<br>
(24) is formed to protrude laterally further from the container (10) than the skirt (30),<br>
thereby providing protection to the skirt (30) during transport of the arrangement.<br>
5.	A container-closure arrangement as claimed in any one of the preceding claims<br>
wherein the closure portion comprises a land (35) that connects at distal end to the<br>
skirt (34A), and from which end the skirt (30) depends, and connects at an opposite<br>
end to a wall section (36) that subtends from this opposite end, wherein the skirt (30).<br>
land (35) and wall section (36) in combination define a substantially U-shaped<br>
channel into which the container rim (16) is receivable, when mounting the closure<br>
(11) thereto, with the first (40) and second ledges (42) projecting into the U-shaped<br>
channel from the skirt (30) and wall section (36) respectively.<br>
6.	A container-closure arrangement as claimed in claim 5 wherein the second ledge (42) projects into the U-shaped channel from the land (35) and, additionally, an internal skirt (52) projects from the land (35) or wall section (36), with a distal end (52A) of the internal skirt (52) being arranged for engagement with an internal ledge (54) defined in the container wall (15).<br>
7.	A container-closure arrangement as claimed in any one of the preceding claims wherein a sealing arrangement is provided between the first portion (32) and the adjacent container rim (16), the sealing arrangement comprising a projection (56) on either the first portion (32) or the rim (16), and a corresponding recess (58) on either the rim (16) or the first portion (32) respectively, the recess (58) being adapted for receiving the projection (56) therein in a close or snug fit when the closure (11) is mounted to the container (10).<br>
8.	A container-closure arrangement as claimed in any one of the preceding claims wherein the internal bead (20) is defined as part of the external upper end of the rim (16A).<br><br></td>
