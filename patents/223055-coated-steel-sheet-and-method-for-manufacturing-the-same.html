				<td>COATED STEEL SHEET AND<br>
METHOD FOR MANUFACTURING THE SAME<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a coated steel sheet and<br>
a method for manufacturing the coated steel sheet suitable for<br>
technical fields, such as automobiles, construction materials,<br>
and household appliances.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
In recent years, in fields, such as automobiles,<br>
construction materials, household appliances, and so on, the<br>
use of high-tensile steel sheet has increased. Particularly<br>
in the automotive industry, the adoption of high-tensile steel<br>
sheet is increasing rapidly with a view to reducing car weight<br>
for better fuel economy and improved crashworthiness.<br>
In addition to high tensile strength, to provide<br>
ductility to withstand a complicated press-forming,<br>
development has been actively pushed forward for a high-ductile<br>
high-tensile steel of a structure containing retained austenite<br>
to utilize a strain-induced transformation of this retained<br>
austenite.<br>
As an example of high-tensile steel sheets, there is one<br>
that has a composition including addition elements such as Si,<br>
Mn, Ti, A1 and P, which is disclosed in Japanese Patent<br>
Publication No. 3-51778. It is well known, however, that as<br>
the Si content is increased, an Si oxide film is formed on the<br>
surfaces of the steel sheet during an annealing process, thus<br>
deteriorating the steel properties, such as chemical properties,<br>
electro-galvanized coating adhesion, hot-dip galvanizability,<br>
and hot-dip galvanized coating adhesion. Above all else, the<br>
big problem is the inferior hot-dip galvanizability of<br>
Si-containing high-tensile steel sheets, i.e., the applied zinc<br>
does not adhere to some portions of the steel sheet" (so-called<br>
"bare-spot") in hot-dip galvanizing, or the adhesion of the<br>
coating is insufficient. When a steel sheet contains not less<br>
than 0.1%) carbon by mass, there has been difficulty in carrying<br>
out galvanizing or forming a stable galvanized layer even on<br>
a continuous hot-dip galvanizing line, which includes a RTH (all<br>
Radiant Tube Heating) type furnace or a NOF (Non Oxidizing<br>
Furnace) type furnace.<br>
As a method for increasing ductility and tensile strength<br>
without increasing the Si content, a technique for achieving<br>
high ductility and high tensile strength has been disclosed,<br>
in which instead of increasing the Si content, the Al content<br>
in the steel is positively increased to thereby prevent the<br>
surface quality deterioration peculiar to the Si-added steel<br>
and simultaneously make the retained austenite stable<br>
(JP-A-5-171344).<br>
However, because Al and Si are readily, oxidizable<br>
elements, in addition to the Si oxide film, an Al oxide film<br>
is formed during annealing, and as with the Si-added steel, it<br>
has been impossible to prevent deteriorations in the hot-dip<br>
galvanizability and the galvanized coating adhesion in the<br>
Al-added steel sheet.<br>
It is generally well known that Al is an element to<br>
deteriorate weldability. To make an Al-added steel<br>
practically applicable, it has become an imperative requirement<br>
to improve its spot-weldability.<br>
When a high-tensile steel sheet is used for automobiles,<br>
after chemical treatment or electrodeposition coating, a top<br>
coat is applied when necessary, and as demand is mounting for<br>
rust resistance in recent years, the improvement of corrosion<br>
resistance after an electrodeposition process is increasingly<br>
important. However, a high-tensile steel sheet, which<br>
contains a large amount of galvannealing elements with high<br>
reactivity, is poorer in corrosion resistance than mild steel.<br>
For this reason, if one tries to further improve corrosion<br>
resistance, there is a problem of difficulty in increasing high<br>
strength.<br>
The present invention has been made to solve the above<br>
problems in the prior art, and has as its object to provide a<br>
coated steel sheet superior in coating adhesion even if the base<br>
sheet is an Al-containing steel sheet, and also provide a method<br>
for manufacturing this coated steel sheet.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Description will be made of a coated steel sheet, and<br>
particularly of a hot-dip galvanized steel sheet and a method<br>
for manufacturing the hot-dip galvanized steel sheet.<br>
(1) First Embodiment<br>
Description will start with a chemical composition of a<br>
steel sheet as a base sheet for coating as a first embodiment<br>
of the present invention. Note that in the following<br>
description, the contents of elements in steel are mentioned<br>
only by percents, but they should all be construed as figures<br>
in percents by mass.<br>
(Not less than 0.1% under 3% of Al)<br>
In this first embodiment, steel sheets that contain not<br>
less than 0.1% of Al are used. The reason is as follows. So<br>
long as the Al content in steel is under 0.1%, a decrease in<br>
the coating adhesion caused by a surface segregation of Al is<br>
less of a problem, or AlN is not formed, which will be described<br>
later. Further, in this embodiment, from a viewpoint of<br>
securing a strength-ductility balance, it is preferable to<br>
provide a steel structure that contains retained austenite;<br>
however, if the Al content is under 0.1%, the retained austenite<br>
is unstable, so that the steel is required to contain not less<br>
than 0.1% of Al, which is adequate from a point of view of<br>
attaining a better strength-ductility balance. Note, however,<br>
that with steel sheets of Al content of not less than 3.0 mass%,<br>
as described later, even if AlN is formed in the surface layer<br>
of the steel sheet, the amount of Al surface segregation during<br>
annealing increases, and it is difficult to obtain an improved<br>
quality of the coating adhesion even though one does what one<br>
can do in formulating a better method of generating a nitride<br>
layer. Consequently, the Al content is limited to under 3.0%.<br>
(One or two kinds out of not less than 0.1% of Si and not less<br>
than 0.5% of Mn)<br>
Si and Mn may be contained since they are conducive to<br>
high strength. Above all else, not less than 0.1% of Si and<br>
not less than 0.5% of Mn are preferably contained from a<br>
viewpoint of achieving high strength. However, Si content of<br>
over 1.0% and Mn content of over 0 . 5% makes it difficult to secure<br>
weldability and coating adhesion; therefore, preferably, the<br>
upper limit of the Si content is limited to 1.0% and the upper<br>
limit of Mn to 3.5%.<br>
(One or two kinds out of not less than 0.01% and not more than<br>
1% of Mo and not less than 0.005% and not more than 0.2% of Nb)<br>
Mo and Nb reduce the grain size of the matrix structure<br>
and retard the recrystallization, to thereby promote the<br>
internal oxidation of Al in the temperature rising process. In<br>
this way, Mo and Nb have an effect of suppressing the surface<br>
segregation of Al. Therefore, Mo and Nb can be contained in<br>
steel to obtain a better coating adhesion. This effect appears<br>
at a Mo content of not less than 0.01% and the Nb content of<br>
not less than 0.005%. However, when the Mo content is over 1%,<br>
in hot-rolling in the production process of a base sheet for<br>
a galvanized steel sheet, there appears a tendency for the<br>
surface property to deteriorate. Further, when the Nb content<br>
is over 0.2%, there is a tendency that the steel hardness rises<br>
and the rolling property deteriorates . Therefore, preferably,<br>
Mo is contained in a range of not less than 0.01% and not more<br>
than 1%, and Nb in a range of not less than 0.005% and not more<br>
than 0.2%. Mo and Nb may be added in the ranges mentioned above.<br>
(Not less than 0.01% and not more than 0.5% of Cu, not less<br>
than 0.01% and not more than 1% of Ni, not less than 0.01% and<br>
not more than 18, of Mo)<br>
When Cu, Ni and Mo are added, the coating adhesion is<br>
improved. The improvement mechanism of the coating adhesion<br>
by addition of Cu, Ni and Mo has not been clarified, but it has<br>
been confirmed that when those elements are added together, but<br>
not separately, the internal oxidation of Al is promoted to<br>
thereby suppress the surface segregation of Al, and the coating<br>
adhesion is improved.<br>
As for other components, considering production cost and<br>
workability of an automotive steel sheet, it is suitable to use<br>
a steel sheet which contains 0 . 0005~0.25 mass% of C, 0.001~0.20<br>
mass% of P, and 0.0001~0.01 mass% of S. Besides those elements,<br>
to further control the strength-ductility balance, it is no<br>
problem if a steel sheet is used which contains not more than<br>
0.15 mass% of Ti, not more than 1 mass% of Cr, and 0.001-0.005<br>
mass% of B to control the balance between strength and ductility<br>
of steel sheet. The rest preferably consists of Fe and<br>
unavoidable impurities.<br>
Description will now be made of the AlN layer formed in<br>
the surface layer, the AlN layer serving as an important factor<br>
of this embodiment.<br>
In this embodiment, an AlN precipitate layer where Al<br>
exists chiefly as AlN is formed in the surface layer of a steel<br>
sheet. For this reason, in the heating step before the<br>
galvanizing process, the Al in steel in the surface layer is<br>
fixed as nitride in the matrix and is inhibited from diffusing<br>
to the surface region of the steel sheet.<br>
It has been recognized that when an AlN precipitate layer<br>
exists, there is an effect that Si and Mn, which are readily<br>
oxidizable elements like Al, are inhibited from increasing<br>
their densities in the surface layer when the steel is annealed,<br>
though the reason is unknown. Therefore, even with steel sheets<br>
which contain relatively large amounts of Si and Mn and<br>
therefore the coating adhesion is liable to deteriorate or<br>
"bare-spot" areas tend to occur, in the presence of an AlN<br>
precipitate layer, favorable hot-dip galvanizability and<br>
better coating adhesion can be obtained.<br>
What is called the AlN precipitate layer here is a layer<br>
in which 20% or more of Al in the basic steel exists as nitride.<br>
When the amount of Al present as nitride is under 20%, the Al<br>
present in a solid solution phase is over 80%, and the Al existing<br>
in solid solution phase diffuses into the surface of the steel<br>
sheet, and therefore the above-mentioned bettering effects of<br>
coating adhesion is reduced.<br>
The amount of Al that precipitated out as AlN is obtained<br>
by a method as follows . For a predetermined thickness (insteps<br>
of 5µm, for example) from the surface layer, a predetermined<br>
amount of the AlN precipitate is dissolved by an electrolytic<br>
method using 10w/v% of acetylacetone-lw/v% of tetramethyl<br>
ammonium chloride-methanol, and insoluble residues are<br>
analyzed, by which the presence of AlN can be conformed. The<br>
residual AlN is decomposed by steam distillation, and by<br>
separating and determining only the quantity of N, the quantity<br>
of the N in the AlN precipitate can be determined. On the basis<br>
of this value, the quantity of Al in the AlN precipitate can<br>
be determined. Further, the quantity of a solid-solution Al<br>
can be determined by evaporating the rest other than the residue<br>
to dryness, again dissolving the residue in acid, and<br>
calculating the quantity of Al by an atomic absorption method<br>
compliant with JIS G 1257. From the above results, the<br>
proportion of nitride of Al in the AlN precipitate layer can<br>
be calculated.<br>
Note that because the presence of AlN can be confirmed<br>
by EPMA analysis of the sectional area of a steel sheet and by<br>
analyzing both N and Al, the presence of AlN can be conformed<br>
by EPMA analysis in a simple manner.<br>
Fig. 1 is a picture showing an SEM electron microscope<br>
observation result of a sectional area of a steel sheet where<br>
an AlN precipitate layer is formed on the surface layer. Fig.<br>
2 is a picture showing an analysis result of the presence of<br>
Al by EPMA. According to Figs. 1 and 2, Al exists as nitride<br>
in a columnar or angular form and is distributed in a region<br>
10~20µm depth from the interface of the steel matrix, and it<br>
is obvious that in that portion of the region where AlN did not<br>
precipitate out, the quantity of solid solution of Al is not<br>
much. This region corresponds to the AlN precipitate layer.<br>
Therefore, the solid solution of Al is inhibited from diffusing<br>
from this region to the surface during annealing, and therefore<br>
the coating adhesion does not deteriorate. It is understood<br>
that in an area much deeper than that region, the presence of<br>
nitride is not recognized, but Al is present mostly in a solid<br>
solution phase.<br>
The thickness of the AlN precipitate layer is preferably<br>
not less than 1µm and not more than 100µm. The reason is as<br>
follows. If there is some amount of AlN precipitate layer in<br>
the surface layer, an effect that prevents surface segregation<br>
of Al will appear, and this effect becomes conspicuous when the<br>
thickness of the AlN precipitate layer is 1µm or more. It is<br>
practically difficult to form an AlN precipitate layer with a<br>
thickness of over 100µm, and if the thickness is over 100µm,<br>
the influence on the quality of material becomes not negligible.<br>
By hot-dip galvanizing, a base sheet for a hot-dip<br>
galvanized steel sheet which has the steel composition and the<br>
AlN precipitate layer as described above, a hot-dip galvanized<br>
steel sheet with excellent coating layer adhesion can be<br>
obtained.<br>
Description will be made of a method for manufacturing<br>
a hot-dip galvanized steel sheet according to this embodiment.<br>
As with an ordinary steel sheet for hot-dip galvanizing,<br>
a steel sheet (a base sheet) for hot-dip galvanizing according<br>
to this embodiment is manufactured by heating and holding a<br>
steel slab made by continuous casting or the like, subjecting<br>
the slab to a hot-rolling process or further to a cold-rolling<br>
process. In the present invention, in order to prevent Al from<br>
segregating at the surface in the annealing process before<br>
hot-dip galvanizing, it is necessary to have an AlN precipitate<br>
layer previously formed on the surface layer of the steel sheet<br>
before or after annealing.<br>
With regard to a method for forming an AlN precipitate<br>
layer, the inventors hit upon a conception that by nitriding<br>
the Al in the steel surface layer when the steel slab was heated<br>
and held, it would be possible to make Al in the surface layer<br>
exist as AlN in the subsequent hot-rolling, acid-cleaning and<br>
cold-rolling processes. On the basis of the above conception,<br>
the present inventors investigated the conditions for heating<br>
and holding a steel slab.<br>
Al is well known as an element that can be easily nitrided.<br>
As a result of our study, it has become clear that Al is nitrided<br>
more in preference over other elements when it is heated at a<br>
high temperature in an atmosphere chiefly consisting of N2 and<br>
including O2. The mechanism by which O2 promotes the nitriding<br>
of Al has not necessarily been clarified. In an O2-bearing<br>
atmosphere, oxides are formed in large amounts on the surface<br>
of the steel and the oxides serve as a diffusion path of nitrogen,<br>
a fact which is considered to be one factor of O2 assisting in<br>
niriding Al. It has also been clarified that in order to<br>
generate nitride of Al while the slab is being heated and held,<br>
the O2 concentration is required to be at least 1 vol% or higher.<br>
Raising the O2 concentration to 20 vol% or higher requires some<br>
other method for blowing oxygen into a heating and holding<br>
furnace and also accelerates oxidation of the steel matrix<br>
itself; therefore, it is necessary to limit the O2 concentration<br>
to not more than 20 vol%. It does not matter if CO and CO2,<br>
other than the components O2 and N2, are mixed, but N2 needs to<br>
be 70 vol% or higher to generate nitride of Al.<br>
In an N2-bearing atmosphere, by heating and holding the<br>
above-mentioned slab at a high heating and holding temperature<br>
and in a prolonged heating and holding time, the Al in the surface<br>
layer of the slab can be nitrided. At this time, if the amount<br>
of Al in the steel is large, the heating and holding time to<br>
nitride the Al becomes longer accordingly. In this respect,<br>
on steels with varying Al contents, inquiry was made into the<br>
effects of the heating and holding time and temperature before<br>
hot-rolling on the adhesion of the hot-dip galvanized coating.<br>
In practice, a slab of a composition containing 0.1~3%<br>
of Al, 0.5% of Si and 2.2% of Mn was used, in an atmosphere of<br>
3 vol% of O2 and the rest consisting of N2, the slab was hot-rolled<br>
to a thickness of 2.8mm. The oxide scale formed on the surface<br>
of an obtained hot-rolled steel sheet was removed by acid<br>
cleaning, and then the steel sheet was cold-rolled to a<br>
thickness of 1.6mm, annealed at 810~825°C, and subjected to<br>
overaging at 400~460°C. Subsequently, the steel sheet was<br>
hot-dip galvanized in a hot-dip Zn bath with an Al concentration<br>
of 0.13 mass% and continuously treated by a galvannealing<br>
process at 500°C.<br>
Samples for evaluating the coating adhesion were taken<br>
from a Zn-Fe galvanneal coated steel sheet. The coating<br>
adhesion was evaluated as follows. A test specimen to which<br>
a cellophane tape was attached was bent 90 degrees on the<br>
tape-attached side and bent back, the tape was peeled off, and<br>
the peeled-off amount of the coating per unit length was<br>
measured in terms of counts of Zn by a fluorescent X-ray method.<br>
Samples ranked first or second were classified as good (O, D)<br>
and those ranked third and so on were classified as defective<br>
(X) by referring to the criteria in Table 1.<br>
The evaluation results are shown in Figs. 3A. to 3D.<br>
According to Figs. 3A to 3D, before hot rolling, a slab is heated<br>
and held under the conditions that the heating and holding<br>
temperature, the heating and holding time and the Al content<br>
in the steel meet equation (1) , by which arrangement a hot-dip<br>
galvanized steel sheet with excellent coating layer adhesion<br>
can be manufactured.<br>
{Heating and holding temperature (°C) — (1050 + 25A1)} X heating<br>
and holding time (mm) = 3000 ........ (1)<br>
where Al denotes an Al content (mass%) in the steel.<br>
As a result of observation of a cold-rolled steel sheet<br>
to check the presence or absence of an AlN precipitate layer,<br>
it was confirmed that an AlN precipitate layer was formed in<br>
the surface layer when the above equation (1) was satisfied.<br>
When a steel sheet with a chemical composition that<br>
contains not less than 0.1% and under 3% of Al is subjected to<br>
heating and holding before hot rolling in an atmosphere with<br>
an O3 content of not less than 1 vol% and not more than 20 vol%<br>
under the condition that meets the equation (1), a steel sheet<br><br>
with an AlN precipitate layer in the surface layer can be<br>
manufactured. Moreover, though containing Al and other<br>
readily oxidizable elements such as Si and Mn, the steel sheet<br>
has an excellent coating adhesion after it has been hot-dip<br>
galvanized.<br>
Note that the AlN formed by the above-mentioned method<br>
is not only included in the steel of the surface layer but also<br>
sometimes exists exposed on the surface of the steel matrix.<br>
Even in such a case, the AlN have no effects on the ductility<br>
and mechanical properties of the steel sheet nor has it effects<br>
on the surface quality such as coating layer adhesion. It is<br>
considered because the AlN precipitate layer is confined to the<br>
uppermost of the surface layer and its exposure at the surface<br>
of the steel matrix is limited to a very few parts thereof.<br>
The hot-rolled steel sheet is obtained by hot rolling<br>
after heating and holding under the above conditions, and the<br>
steel sheet is then subjected to acid cleaning or acid cleaning<br>
plus cold rolling and annealing, and furthermore the steel sheet<br>
is hot-dip galvanized.<br>
The acid cleaning of the hot-rolled steel sheet is done<br>
to remove the oxide scale formed on its surfaces. The<br>
conditions for acid cleaning are not limited to specific items,<br>
but because the AlN precipitate layer is required to remain,<br>
consideration must be given to prevent the steel matrix from<br>
being dissolved in large amounts during acid cleaning. The acid<br>
is preferably hydrochloric acid, but other acids such as<br>
sulfuric acid may be used. The concentration of the acid is<br>
preferably l~20 mass%. To prevent the steel matrix from<br>
dissolving in large amounts, an inhibitor (dissolution<br>
inhibitor) is preferably added.<br>
Cold rolling may be performed if necessary to control the<br>
mechanical properties and the thickness of a final product.<br>
When cold rolling is carried out, the draft is preferably 30%<br>
or higher to promote recrystallization in subsequent annealing.<br>
However, if the draft is 80% or higher, large load is applied<br>
to the rolling mill, making rolling difficult; therefore, the<br>
draft is preferably 30~80%.<br>
Annealing just before hot-dip galvanizing may be by a<br>
method in which hot-dip galvanizing is performed successively<br>
after annealing has been done by well-known so-called<br>
continuous annealing, or by a method in which a steel sheet<br>
annealed once (primary annealing) is cooled, and then the steel<br>
sheet is acid-cleaned to activate its surface and also after<br>
the surface oxide formed by primary annealing is removed by acid<br>
cleaning, the steel sheet is heated again (secondary annealing)<br>
and successively hot-dip galvanized. However, the annealing<br>
process just before galvanizing preferably includes a step for<br>
uniformly heating the steel sheet at least partially under a<br>
reducing atmospheric condition chiefly consisting of H2-N2 with<br>
a view to deoxidizing the Fe-based surface oxide film and<br>
securing the hot-dip galvanized coating wettability. Or it is<br>
no problem if a process may be employed in which an Fe-based<br>
oxide film is formed in the temperature-rising process in an.<br>
NOF (Nonoxidation furnace) type heating furnace, for example,<br>
and the oxide film is deoxidized. Note that primary annealing<br>
is preferably at 750~930°C to obtain an appropriate structure.<br>
If the primary annealing temperature is higher than 930°C, the<br>
readily oxidizable elements such as Si increases its<br>
segregation at the surface which adversely affects the<br>
galvanizability and the galvannealability. The secondary<br>
annealing is preferably at 650°C or higher with a view to<br>
deoxidizing the oxide film formed during acid cleaning, and<br>
preferably at not less than 850°C with a view to preventing<br>
the coarse-grain, for example, of the steel structure.<br>
Acid cleaning after primary annealing is performed, for<br>
example, by a method of light acid-cleaning at 60°C for several<br>
seconds in a hydrochloric acid of about 5 mass's or so. Other<br>
acids such as sulfuric acid may be used. Generally, acid<br>
cleaning is preferably performed with acidity of pH = 1,<br>
temperature of 40~90°C for 1~20 sec. If the temperature is<br>
below 40°C and the time is less than 1 sec, the removal effect<br>
of surface segregates cannot be obtained, and if the temperature<br>
is higher than 90°C and the time is longer than 20 sec, excessive<br>
acid cleaning occurs, which results in roughening of the<br>
surface.<br>
A steel sheet is provided with a strength-ductility<br>
balance as follows . When annealing and hot-dip galvanizing are<br>
performed continuously in a continuous annealing process, it<br>
is desirable that after intercritical heating is finished,<br>
while bainite transformation is made to take place by overaging<br>
at 350~500°C for not less than two minutes to let segregates<br>
of C appear in the austenite, and continuously performing<br>
hot-dip galvanizing. When hot-dip galvanizing is performed<br>
after primary annealing, cooling, acid cleaning, and secondary<br>
annealing, preferably, after intercritical heating by primary<br>
annealing, the steel sheet is quenched below 300°C at a rate<br>
of not less than 40°C/s to obtain a hardened structure consisting<br>
of a ferrite-martensite phase, and immediately before<br>
galvanizing, a tempering process is carried out by heating to<br>
725~840°C, and then cooling at a rate of not less than 5°C/s<br>
to form a composite structure of ferrite-tempered<br>
martensite-retained austenite, and finally hot-dip<br>
galvanizing is performed.<br>
As a method for forming the AlN precipitate layer,<br>
description has been made of a method for adjusting the heating<br>
and holding conditions before hot rolling. Incidentally, a<br>
steel sheet for hot-dip galvanizing according to the present<br>
invention can be manufactured by annealing the steel sheet in<br>
an atmosphere of nitriding elements, such as an H2-N2 system<br>
gas, mixed with trace amounts of CO and NH3 in the annealing<br>
process just before hot-dip galvanizing.<br>
Description will be made of a hot-dip galvanized steel<br>
sheet according to this embodiment.<br>
A hot-dip galvanized steel sheet according to this<br>
embodiment can be obtained by hot-dip galvanizing a steel sheet<br>
for hot-dip galvanizing purpose, which includes the<br>
above-mentioned AlN precipitate layer. The AlN layer remains<br>
on the matrix side near the interface between the steel sheet<br>
and the hot-dip galvanized layer after the hot-dip galvanizing<br>
process. The hot-dip galvanized steel sheet obtained as<br>
described has a good coating adhesion because the readily<br>
oxidizable elements such as Al, Si and Mn are inhibited from<br>
segregating at the interface between the steel matrix and the<br>
coating layer.<br>
The hot-dip galvanized layer (hereafter referred to<br>
simply as the coating layer} is preferably a coating layer of<br>
a composition containing 0.1~1% of Al or an a Zn-Fe galvanneal<br>
coating layer that further contains 7~15% of Fe in addition to<br>
the above-mentioned chemical composition.<br>
With a hot-dip galvanized steel sheet without<br>
galvannealing the coating layer (this steel sheet is hereafter<br>
referred to as GI), if the Al content in the coat layer is below<br>
0.1%, the Fe-Zn galvannealing reaction shows rapid progress<br>
during the galvanizing process; therefore, unevenness occurs<br>
in the external appearance. With the GI, above all else, the<br>
Al content is preferably not less than 0.2% to inhibit the<br>
galvannealing reaction. When the Al content in the coating<br>
layer is over 1%, in the galvanizing process, the Fe-Al alloy<br>
layer becomes thick which is formed on the coating layer side<br>
close to the interface between the coating and the steel matrix,<br>
with the result that the weldability decreases.<br>
If Pb, Sb or Ni, sometimes contained in trace amounts in<br>
a galvanizing bath, exists in the coating layer in a range of<br>
not more than 0.1% each, then there is no problem in terms of<br>
characteristics of the steel. When the Fe eluates into the<br>
galvanizing bath or the matrix Fe is mixed into the coating layer,<br>
if its amount is not more than 0.1% or so, there is no problem.<br>
Mg may be contained in a range not more than 5% to impart<br>
corrosion resistance to the steel. Besides those elements<br>
mentioned above, others are preferably Zn or unavoidable<br>
impurities.<br>
Even with a Zn-Fe galvanneal coated steel sheet whose<br>
coating layer is galvannealed (hereafter referred to as GA) ,<br>
the quantity of Al in the coating layer is required to be 0.1~1%.<br>
The reason is as follows. If the Al content is below 0.1%, the<br>
Fe-Zn galvannealing reaction progresses so rapidly in a<br>
galvannealing process that the coating adhesion deteriorates;<br>
on the other hand, if the Al content is more than 1%, the Fe-Al<br>
alloy layer, which is formed on the coating layer side near the<br>
interface between the coating and the steel matrix, becomes so<br>
thick that the Fe-Zn galvannealing reaction is retarded. The<br>
desirable Al concentration is not more than 0.3%). With a Zn-Fe<br>
galvanneal coated steel sheet whose coating layer is<br>
galvannealed, if the Fe content in the coating layer is under<br>
1%, a soft Zn-Fe galvanneal layer is formed, resulting in a lower<br>
slidability. Or, if the Fe content is over 15%, a hard and<br>
brittle Fe-Zn galvanneal layer is formed on the coating layer<br>
side near the interface between the steel matrix and the coating<br>
layer, and the result is a poor coating adhesion. For this<br>
reason, the Fe content in the Zn-Fe galvanneal coated steel<br>
sheet is preferably 7~151. If Pb, Sb and Ni are contained in<br>
amounts of not more than 0.1% each, there is no problem in<br>
soldering properties. If Mg is contained in a range of not more<br>
than 5% to secure corrosion resistance, there is no problem at<br>
all. The rest preferably consists of Zn and unavoidable<br>
impurities.<br>
For hot-dip galvanizing, a well-known method can be<br>
applied. For example, preferably, the bath temperature is<br>
440~500°C and the Al concentration in the bath is 0.10~0.20%<br>
when a galvannealing process is performed which will be<br>
described later, or 0.14~0.247, when a galvannealing process is<br>
not performed. Mg may be contained in the bath for better<br>
corrosion resistance.<br>
After hot-dip galvanizing, if the coating layer undergoes<br>
a galvannealing process in a temperature range of 460~550°C,<br>
this is most desirable. If the temperature is under 460°C, the<br>
galvannealing reaction progresses slowly. Or if the temperature<br>
is above 550°C, excess galvannealing occurs; therefore, a hard<br>
and brittle Zn-Fe galvanneal layer is formed in large amounts<br>
at the interface of the matrix, causing the coating adhesion<br>
to deteriorate. Furthermore, if the steel is a steel with a<br>
retained austenite phase formed in the steel, when the<br>
galvannealing temperature is higher than 550°C, the retained<br>
austenite decomposes, and the strength-ductility balance tends<br>
to deteriorate. The coating layer weight has not been set, but<br>
from a viewpoint of securing the corrosion resistance and<br>
controlling the precision of coating weight, it is preferably<br>
not less than 10g/m2, and not more than 120 g/m2 from a viewpoint<br>
of workability.<br>
(Embodiment)<br>
Slabs of compositions shown in Table 2 are heated and held<br>
in an N2 atmosphere of O2 densities as shown in Tables 3 and 4<br>
in a heating furnace at temperatures and conditions shown in<br>
Tables 3 and 4, and subsequently hot-rolled to a thickness of<br>
2.8 mm and are coiled at 540~600°C. Subsequently, the skin scale<br>
was removed by acid cleaning. Some of hot-rolled steel sheets<br>
which have been acid-cleaned are cold-rolled into cold-rolled<br>
steel sheets with a thickness of 1.6mm. Hot-rolled and cold<br>
rolled steel sheets obtained undergo primary annealing and<br>
overaginq under conditions shown in Tables 3 and 4, and are<br>
hot-dip galvanized in a molten Zn bath at a bath temperature<br>
of 460°C. Or, if they are subjected to secondary annealing,<br>
they receive primary annealing and cooling, and then<br>
acid-cleaned in a 5% HCl solution at 60°C. After this, the steel<br>
sheet are heated at secondary annealing temped at mass shown in<br>
Tables 3 and 4, and continuously they are hot-dip galvanized<br>
in a molten Zn bath at a bath temperature of 460°C.<br>
The Al concentration in the molten Zn bath is adjusted<br>
as shown in Tables 5 and 6. The coating weight is adjusted to<br>
50±5g/m for single side by gas wiping. When the coating layer<br>
is galvannealed, the galvannealing process is performed at<br>
460~610°C.<br>
Obtained hot-dip galvanized steel sheets are evaluated<br>
in terms of external appearance, coating adhesion, and<br>
mechanical properties. Samples are taken from the produced<br>
steel sheets, and the thickness was measured of the AlN<br>
precipitate layer formed on the matrix side right under the<br>
interface between the matrix and the coating layer, and the Al<br>
concentration and the Fe concentration in the coating layer were<br>
measured. Investigation results are shown in Tables 5 and 6.<br><br>
In Tables 5 and 6, as coating kinds, a hot-dip galvanized<br>
coating layer that has been galvannealed is designated as GA<br>
and a hot-dip galvanized coating layer that has not been<br>
galvannealed is designated as GI. With regard to kinds of base<br>
sheets for coating, a case where a hot-rolled steel sheet is<br>
used is designated as HOT, a case where a cold-rolled steel<br>
sheet annealed once is used is designated as CR, and a case<br>
where a cold-rolled steel sheet subjected to annealing - acid<br>
cleaning - reheating is used is designated as CAL.<br>
The external appearance was evaluated by visually<br>
checking the galvanizability with reference to criteria as<br>
follows.<br>
o: Without any "bare-spot"<br>
D: Generally no problem even though there are some "bare<br>
spots"<br>
X: "bare" spots occurred conspicuously<br>
The coating layer adhesion was evaluated as follows.<br>
A cellophane tape was attached to the surface of a specimen,<br>
the tape-attached side was bent 90 degrees and bent back, the<br>
tape was peeled off, the peeled-off amount of the coating per<br>
unit length was measured in terms of counts of Zn by a<br>
fluorescent X-ray method. Samples ranked first or second were<br>
classified as good (o, A) and those ranked third and so on<br>
were classified as defective (X) by referring to the criteria<br>
in Table 1.<br>
A hot-dip galvanized steel sheet (GI) that has not been<br>
galvannealed was put to a ball impact test, and a cellophane<br>
tape was attached to a processed part and the tape was peeled<br>
off. Whether the coating layer was peeled off or not was<br>
evaluated according to criteria as follows.<br>
o: The coating layer did not peel off.<br>
D: The coating layer peeled off a little.<br>
X: The coating layer peeled off conspicuously.<br>
In evaluation of mechanical properties, JIS-No.5<br>
tension test specimens were collected, and from measured<br>
tensile strength TS(MPa) and elongation E1 (%), if a result<br>
of TS X E1 was not less than 20000 MPa • %, this was taken to<br>
represent a good strength-ductility balance and the hot-dip<br>
galvanized steel was determined to have a favorable mechanical<br>
properties.<br>
With regard to the Al concentration in the coating layer,<br>
the coating was dissolved in an alkali, such as NaOH or KOH,<br>
or in an acid, such as HCl or H2SO4, added with an inhibitor,<br>
and its solution was analyzed and the concentration of Al was<br>
determined by a plasma emission spectrometer (ICP).<br>
Likewise, the Fe concentration in the coating layer was<br>
measured by ICP by analysis and quantitative determination of Fe.<br>
The thickness of the AlN precipitate layer was obtained<br>
by analyzing the sectional surface of a galvanized steel sheet<br>
by EPMA, and measuring the thickness of a ragion where there<br>
were precipitates of AlN and the Al concentration in the matrix area is lower than the central portion of the steel sheet. The<br>
Al concentration of the matrix area in the AlN precipitate<br>
layer was obtained by analyzing the above-mentioned insoluble<br>
residues.<br>
From Tables 5 and 6, the hot-dip galvanized steel sheet<br>
(GA or GI) is A or o in evaluation of the external appearance<br>
and A or o in evaluation of coating adhesion; therefore, it<br>
is understood that this galvanized steel sheet has favorable<br>
galvanizability and coating adhesion. Furthermore, in<br>
respect to mechanical properties, the steel sheet shows a<br>
favorable strength-ductility balance of 20000 MPa • % or higher.<br>
In contrast, in comparative examples 1, 2, 7, 8, 10 and<br>
11, there is not AlN precipitate layer, and therefore the<br>
external appearance and the coating adhesion are poor. In<br>
comparative examples 3 and 13, in which the Al concentration<br>
is low in the coating, the coating adhesion is poor. In<br>
comparative examples 4, 5, 14 and 15 of Zn-Fe galvanneal coated<br>
steel sheet, the Al concentration in the coating layer is high<br>
in comparative examples 4 and 14 and the Fe concentration in<br>
the coating layer is low, so that there is unevenness in the<br>
galvannealing results. In comparative examples 5 and 15,<br>
because of the high Fe concentration in the coating layer, the<br>
coating adhesion is insufficient. In comparative examples 6<br>
and 9, in which steel sheets of low Al content were used as<br>
base sheets, it is obvious that the mechanical properties are<br>
inferior. In comparative example 12, because the primary<br>
annealing temperature is too high, the galvannealing reaction<br>
in the coating layer did not progress sufficiently, and<br>
moreover, the coating adhesion and mechanical properties are<br>
deficient.<br>
(2) Second Embodiment<br>
Description will now be made of a chemical composition<br>
of base steel sheet to undergo electroplating or chemical<br>
treatment according to a second embodiment of the present<br>
invention. Also in the second embodiment, the contents of<br>
elements in the steel are expressed simply by percent (V,) which,<br>
however, should all be construed to mean "in percent by mass<br>
(mass%)".<br>
(Al: Not less than 0.17, and under 37,)<br>
In this embodiment, as in the first embodiment, steels<br>
with an Al content of not less than 0.17, are used. The reason<br>
is as follow: So long as the Al content is under 0.1%, because<br>
the surface-segregated amount of Al is low, there are not much<br>
of problems in the electrocoating adhesion and the unevenness<br>
of electroplated coating or chemical treatment coating, or the<br>
external appearance, and AlN is not formed, either. Also in<br>
this embodiment, with a view to securing a strength-ductility<br>
balance, preferably, the chemical composition contains<br>
retained austenite, and if the Al content is under 0.1%, the<br>
retained austenite is unstable; therefore, with a view to<br>
obtaining a better strength-ductility balance of the steel<br>
sheet, it is required that not less than 0.1% of Al should be<br>
contained in the steel sheet. Note that in a steel sheet with<br>
an Al content of not less than 3.0 mass%, even if AlN is formed<br>
in the surface layer of a steel sheet, the surface segregated<br>
Al is formed in large amounts during annealing, making it<br>
difficult to secure a better coating adhesion despite the best<br>
efforts that could be made to improve the method for forming<br>
a nitride layer; therefore, the Al content in the steel is set<br>
under 3.0%.<br>
(One or two kinds out of not less than 0.1% of Si and not less<br>
than 0.5% of Mn)<br>
For the same reason as in the first embodiment, one or<br>
two kinds out of Si and Mn are set in the ranges mentioned above.<br>
(One or two kinds selected out of not less 0.01% and not more<br>
than 1% of Mo, and not less than 0.005% and not more than 0.2%<br>
of Nb)<br>
For the same reason as in the first embodiment, one or<br>
two kinds out of Mo and Nb are set in the ranges mentioned above.<br>
(Not less than 0.01% and not more than 0.5% of Cu, not less<br>
than 0.01% and not more than 1% of Ni, not less than 0.011% and<br>
not more than 1% of Mo)<br>
By adding Cu, Ni and Mo, the coating adhesion of the steel<br>
sheet is improved. The mechanism of improving the<br>
electrocoating adhesion and chemical properties by adding Cu,<br>
Ni and Mo has not been clarified. But, the present inventors<br>
have continued that when those elements are added together,<br>
but not singly, the internal oxidation of Al is promoted during<br>
annealing, and therefore Al is prevented from segregating in<br>
the surface, thus improving the coating adhesion.<br>
With regard to other components, considering production<br>
cost and also workability when a steel sheet is used as an<br>
automotive steel sheet, preferably, 0.005~0.25% of C,<br>
0.001~0.20%, of P, and 0.0001~0.10% of S should be contained.<br>
Besides these elements, to control a strength-ductility<br>
balance of the steel sheet, it is permissible to contain not<br>
more than 0.15% of Ti, not more than 1% of Cr and 0.001~0.005%<br>
of B. The rest consists of Fe and unavoidable impurities.<br>
Description will be made of the AlN precipitate layer<br>
formed in the surface layer of a steel sheet, which is an<br>
important point of this embodiment.<br>
In this embodiment, as in the first embodiment, the AlN<br>
precipitate layer is formed in the surface layer of the steel<br>
sheet, and fixed in the form of nitride in the matrix, the Al<br>
in the steel of the surface layer is prevented from diffusing<br>
into the surface layer of the steel sheet in annealing or acid<br>
cleaning.<br>
Though the reason has not been clarified, it has been<br>
confirmed that the presence of the AlN precipitate layer has<br>
the effect of inhibiting Si and Mn as readily oxidizable<br>
elements other than Al from segregating at the surface of the<br>
steel during annealing. Therefore, even with steels which<br>
contain relatively large amounts of Si and Mn and which tend<br>
to cause a poor coating adhesion or bare spots, the presence<br>
of an AlN precipitate layer secures better electroplated<br>
coating properties and coating adhesion.<br>
The cross section of a steel sheet having an AlN<br>
precipitate layer formed in the surface layer is the same as<br>
shown in Fig. 1 of the first embodiment (the result observed<br>
by an electron microscope (SEM) , and the state of presence of<br>
Al by EPMA is the same as shown in Fig. 2 of the first embodiment.<br>
Therefore, the Al exists as nitride in a columnar or angular<br>
form and is distributed in a region l0~20µm deep from the<br>
interface of the steel matrix, and it is obvious that in that<br>
portion of the region where AlN did not precipitate out, there<br>
is not much of solid solution of Al. This region corresponds<br>
to the AlN precipitate layer. Therefore, the solid solution<br>
of Al is inhibited from diffusing from this region to the<br>
surface during annealing, and therefore the coating adhesion<br>
does not deteriorate. It is understood that in an area much<br>
deeper than that region, the presence of nitride is not<br>
recognized, but Al exists mostly in a solid solution phase.<br>
For the same reason as in the first embodiment, in this<br>
embodiment, the thickness of the AlN precipitate layer is<br>
preferably not less than 1µm and not more than 100µm.<br>
Description will now be made of a preferred method for<br>
manufacturing a coated steel sheet according to the present<br>
invention. Like with an ordinary steel sheet, this steel sheet<br>
(a base sheet for an electroplating or chemical treatment<br>
process) is manufactured by heating and holding a cast steel<br>
slab (continuously-cast slab for example) for a predetermined<br>
time and having the slab go through a hot-rolling process or,<br>
if necessary, further subjecting it to a cold-rolling process.<br>
In this invention, however, in order to prevent Al from<br>
segregating at the surface layer in the annealing process<br>
before electroplating or chemical treatment, an AlN<br>
precipitate layer is previously formed in the surface layer<br>
of the steel sheet before annealing or after acid cleaning.<br>
The present inventors, to form this AlN precipitate<br>
layer, carried out the above-mentioned heating and holding of<br>
the cast steel slab in an atmosphere containing not less than<br>
1 vol% and not more than 20 vol% of O2- and not less than 70<br>
vol% of N2 like in the first embodiment.<br>
By carrying out the above-mentioned heating and holding<br>
of the cast steel slab in an N2-containing atmosphere at a<br>
raised holding temperature and for a prolonged holding time,<br>
the Al in the surface layer of the steel slab can be nitirided.<br>
In this case, if the Al content is high in the cast slab, the<br>
heating and holding time necessary for nitridation is<br>
prolonged accordingly. Regarding steels with varying Al<br>
contents, investigation was made into the effects that heating<br>
and holding time and temperature before hot rolling have on<br>
the electroplated coating adhesion and the chemical properties,<br>
and details are described as follows.<br>
A cast steel slab of a composition containing 0.1~3% of<br>
Al, 0 . 5% of Si and 2.2% of Mo was heated and held in an atmosphere<br>
of 70 vol% of O2 and the rest consisting of of N2 was hot-roxled<br>
into a street sheet of a thickness of 2.8 mm. The oxide scale<br>
on the surface of an obtained hot-rolled steel sheet was<br>
removed by acid cleaning, and then the steel sheet was<br>
cold-rolled to a 1.6 mm thickness, and annealed at 810~825°C,<br>
overaged at 400~460°C, and then subjected to<br>
electro-galvanizing and Zn phosphating by well-known methods,<br>
respectively.<br>
An obtained electro-galvanized steel sheet was<br>
evaluated in coating adhesion by an OT bending cast as follows.<br>
In the OT bending test, an electro-galvanized steel<br>
sheet was folded in twofold without leaving no gap with the<br>
side under evaluation of the coating adhesion facing outside,<br>
a cellophane tape was attached to the folded portion and peeled<br>
off, and the amount of the coating adhering to the cellophane<br>
tape was visually inspected. Evaluation was made according<br>
to the criterion 1.<br>
(Criterion 1):<br>
O: The coating did not peel off.<br>
D: The coating slightly peeled off to a level of no problem.<br>
X: The coating peeled off conspicuously.<br>
An obtained zinc-phosphated steel sheet was visually<br>
inspected to see if there was any unevenness in adhesion of<br>
the zinc phosphate film, and evaluated according to criterion<br>
2 as follows.<br>
(Criterion 2)<br>
O: The coating weight is free of unevenness.<br>
D: The coating weight was slightly uneven but no problem.<br>
X: The coating weight was conspicuously uneven.<br>
In those evaluations, if those which were evaluated as<br>
O or A in both of electroplated coating adhesion and chemical<br>
properties are classified as o and those which were evaluated<br>
as X in one or both of electroplated coating adhesion and<br>
chemical properties are classified as X, then the evaluation<br>
results of this embodiment are the same as those in Figs. 3A<br>
to 3D showing the evaluation of the coating adhesion in the<br>
first embodiment.<br>
Therefore, as is obvious from Figs. 3A to 3D, by heating<br>
and holding a cast steel sheet before hot rolling under the<br>
conditions that the heating and holding temperature, the<br>
heating and holding time and the Al content all meet Eq. (1),<br>
in other words, under the conditions that fall within the upper<br>
area of the border line between the o-mark area and the X~mark<br>
area, an electro-galvanized steel sheet can be manufactured<br>
with excellent coating adhesion.<br>
{Heating &amp; holding temperature (°C)-(1050 + 2SA1)} X heating<br>
&amp; holding time (min) = 3000 ...... (1)<br>
where Al denotes the Al content (mass%) in the steel.<br>
It could be confirmed that when Eq. (1) is satisfied, the<br>
Al precipitate layer is formed in the surface layer of the steel<br>
sheet.<br>
As has been described, with a cast steel sheet of a<br>
composition that contains not less than 0.1% and under 3% of<br>
Al, by heating and holding before hot rolling under conditions<br>
that meet Eq. (1) in an atmosphere containing not less than 1<br>
vol% and not more than 20 vol% of O2, a steel sheet having an<br>
AlN precipitate layer formed in the surface layer can be<br>
manufactured, and even with a steel sheet containing readily<br>
oxidizable elements such as Si and Mn, besides Al, it is<br>
possible to achieve better electro-galvanized coating<br>
adhesion and chemical properties.<br>
A hot-rolled steel sheet that has been hot-rolled after<br>
heated and held under the above-mentioned conditions is, after<br>
acid cleaning or after acid cleaning, cold rolling, and<br>
annealing, subjected to electroplating and chemical treatment<br>
processes.<br>
In this embodiment, acid cleaning after hot rolling is<br>
done to remove the oxide scale formed on the surface, but<br>
acid-cleaning conditions are not specified. However, because<br>
an AlN precipitate layer needs to remain, consideration is<br>
required to prevent the matrix from dissolving in large amounts<br>
during acid cleaning. The acid to be used for cleaning is<br>
preferably hydrochloric acid, but other acids such as sulfuric<br>
acid may be used. The acid concentration is preferably 1~20<br>
mass% . To prevent the matrix from dissolving in large amounts,<br>
an inhibitor (dissolution inhibitor) may be added in the acid<br>
cleaning liquid.<br>
In this embodiment, cold rolling is carried out when<br>
necessary to control the mechanical properties and the sheet<br>
thickness of a final product. Cold rolling is preferably<br>
performed with a draft of not less than 30% to promote<br>
recrystallization in subsequent annealing. Note that when<br>
the draft is not less than 80%, load on the rolling mill is<br>
so large that rolling becomes difficult, so that ihe draft is<br>
preferably 30~80%.<br>
Further in this embodiment, annealing may be carried out<br>
by a well-known continuous annealing method. Annealing may<br>
be performed not only on cold-rolled steel sheets but also on<br>
hot-rolled steel sheets. To achieve a better balance between<br>
strength and ductility of steel sheet, when be a annealing by<br>
a continuous annealing method and electro-galvanizing are<br>
carried out continuously, it is preferable to perform<br>
overaging at 350~500°C for two minutes or longer after<br>
intercritical heating, and while having bainite<br>
transformation to progress, make the carbon segregate in the<br>
austenite, and subsequently carry out electro-galvanizing.<br>
When electro-galvanizing is carried out after primary<br>
annealing, cooling, acid cleaning, and secondary annealing,<br>
it is preferable to perform intercritical heating by primary<br>
annealing, then quenching the steel sheet down to 300°C or lower<br>
at a rate of 40°C/s or higher to thereby form a. hardened<br>
structure composed of ferrite/martensite phases, and just<br>
before galvanizing, and then tempering the steel sheet by<br>
heating to 725~840°C and cooling at a rate of 5°C/s or higher<br>
to thereby form a composite structure ferrite, tempered<br>
martensite and retained austenite.<br>
The technology for forming the AlN precipitate layer,<br>
which has been described, is to control conditions for heating<br>
and holding before hot rolling. However, to manufacture a<br>
coated steel sheet according to this embodiment, this<br>
technology for controlling the heating and holding conditions<br>
may not be adopted. For example, the above-mentioned coated<br>
can be manufactured by a method of annealing in an atmosphere<br>
of nitriding elements, such as an H2-N2 system gas, mixed with<br>
trace amounts of CO and NH3 in the annealing process.<br>
As electroplating applied to a steel sheet for coating<br>
according to this embodiment, electro galvanized coating, in<br>
which the chief component is Zn, is most suitable. For example,<br>
besides pure-zinc electroplating, zinc-alloy electroplating<br>
that contains elements, such as Fe, Ni, Co and Mo, may be cited.<br>
In addition, it is possible to use a zinc-based electroplated<br>
coating which has inorganic compounds or organic compounds<br>
dispersed or separated out in a zinc-based electroplated<br>
coating. As a chemical treatment process, an ordinary method,<br>
such as zinc-phosphating may be applied.<br>
A coated steel sheet according to this embodiment,<br>
though subjected to electroplated coating or chemical<br>
treatment, the coating adhesion, coating weight and crawling<br>
of the electroplated coating, and the coarsening of<br>
crystalline grains by chemical treatment are improved to a<br>
great extent.<br>
(Embodiment)<br>
A cast steel slab of a composition shown in Table 7 was<br>
heated and held in a heating furnace under the conditions shown<br>
in Table 8 and subsequently hot-rolled to a thickness of 2.8<br>
mm and wound up in a coil at 540~600°C. After this, the skin<br>
scale was removed from the strip by acid cleaning. Some of<br>
acid-cleaned hot-rolled steel sheet is cold-rolled into a<br>
cold-rolled strip with a thickness of 1.6 mm, annealed at<br>
800~850°C, and overaged at 400~500°C, and cooled.<br>
An obtained hot-rolled strip or cold-rolled strip as a<br>
base sheet was coated by any one of Zn phosphating, pure-zinc<br>
electroplated coating, electro zinc-nickel alloy coating, and<br>
electro zinc-iron coating by a well-known method. Base sheets<br>
were measured to determine the thickness of the AlN precipitate<br>
layer and the solid solution rate of Al in the AlN precipitate<br>
layer. An electroplated steel sheet was subjected to the OT<br>
bending test mentioned above, and the coating adhesion was<br>
evaluated. The electroplated coating property or the chemical<br>
properties was decided from external appearance by visual<br>
examination to see if there was external unevenness, such as<br>
unevenness of coating weight, and evaluated according to<br>
Criterion 2.<br>
As for mechanical properties, JIS-specified No. 5<br>
tension test specimens were taken from the strip, and tensile<br>
test was conducted to measure tensile strength (TS (MPa)) and<br>
elongation (El (%)). From measured values, TS X El was<br>
obtained, and if the value was 20,000 (MPa • %) or larger, this<br>
was decided to show a favorable strength-ductility balance of<br>
the steel sheet, and the mechanical properties were evaluated<br>
as good.<br>
From Fig. 8, it is obvious that in embodiments of the<br>
invention in which electroplating was performed, steel sheets<br>
are superior in the coating adhesion and the external<br>
appearance, and exhibit excellent mechanical properties. It<br>
is also evident that steel sheets in embodiments of the<br>
invention in which chemical treatment was carried out show<br>
superb external appearance and offers favorable mechanical<br>
properties.<br><br>
(3) Third Embodiment<br>
Description will be made of a chemical composition<br>
of a high-strength steel sheet and a base sheet for a<br>
high-strength hot-dip galvanized steel sheet according to a<br>
third embodiment of the present invention. Also in the third<br>
embodiment, the contents of elements in the steel are expressed<br>
simply by percent (%) which, however, should all be construed<br>
to mean "in percents by mass (massl)".<br>
(not less than 0.1% and under 3.0% of Al)<br>
For the same reason as in the first embodiment, the Al<br>
content is in the above-mentioned range.<br>
(C: 0.03-0.25%)<br>
The C content needs to be not less than 0.03% to secure<br>
a desired structure. However, a large amount of C degrades<br>
weldability, and therefore the C content should be limited to<br>
more than 0.25%.<br>
(Si: 0.001-1.0%)<br>
To obtain desired strength and structure, not less than<br>
0.001% of Si is added. If Si, like with Al, is present as an<br>
internal oxide in the surface layer, the problem of surface<br>
treatability can be avoided. However, If the Si content in<br>
the steel is over 1.0%, even though Si is present in the surface<br>
layer but as its oxide in an inner area of the steel sheet,<br>
the post-painting corrosion resistance of the steel sheet<br>
which was coated is low. For this reason, the upper limit of<br>
Si content is 1.0%.<br>
(Mn: 0.5~3.0%)<br>
To obtain a desired strength, Mn is added in an amount<br>
of 0.5% or more. However, if the added amount is over 3%, the<br>
weldability deteriorates, so that the Mn content is limited<br>
to not more than 3.0%.<br>
(P: 0.001~0.10%)<br>
Though P is an element which is used to achieve high<br>
strength without aggravating deep drawing property; however,<br>
the addition of an excessive amount of P delays a galvannealing<br>
reaction or deteriorates secondary fabrication embrittlement,<br>
so that the P content is limited to not more than 0.10%. The<br>
lower limit is 0.001%, a level of unavoidable impurity content.<br>
Steel sheets according to the present invention, in<br>
addition to the indispensable elements mentioned above, may<br>
contain the following components where necessary.<br>
(Mo: 0.01~1.0%, Nb: 0.005~0.2%)<br>
Mo and Nb reduce the grain size of the matrix structure<br>
and delay the recrystallization, to thereby promote the<br>
internal oxidation of Al in the temperature rising process,<br>
and are preferably added to obtain better coating property and<br>
coating adhesion. When Mo and Nb are added together, however,<br>
if the Mo content is over 1.0%, the surface properties of a<br>
hot-rolled steel sheet shows a tendency to deteriorate, or if<br>
the Mo content is under 0.01%, the intended effect is less<br>
likely to be obtained. On the other hand, when Nb is added<br>
at a content of over 0.2%, the hardness tends to rise and the<br>
ductility tends to deteriorate, but if the content is under<br>
0.005%, the effect is small. Therefore, preferably, the Mo<br>
content is 0.01~1.0%, and the Nb content is 0.005~0.21%<br>
(Cu: 0.01~0.5%, Ni: 0.01~1.0%,; Mo: 0.01~1.0%)<br>
Cu, Ni and Mo are elements desirable for obtaining better<br>
coating adhesion/ and only when they are added together, the<br>
internal oxidation is promoted during annealing, and therefore<br>
they are prevented from segregating in the surface, thus<br>
improving the coating adhesion. However, when they are in<br>
large amounts, there is a tendency for the surface properties<br>
of the steel sheet to deteriorate, so that their added amounts<br>
need to meet the conditions : 0.01~0.5% of Cu, 0.01~l.0% of Ni,<br>
and 0.01-1.0% of Mo.<br>
As for other chemical components, considering an<br>
application as steel sheets for automobiles, to improve the<br>
strength-ductility balance, other elements may bo added when<br>
necessary in the following ranges: not more than 0.15% of Ti,<br>
not more than 1% of Cr, and 0.001~0.005% of B.<br>
The rest other than the above-mentioned elements are<br>
preferably Fe and unavoidable impurities.<br>
Description will next be made of the internal oxide layer<br>
to be possessed by a high strength steel sheet and a<br>
high-strength hot-dip galvanized steel sheet according to this<br>
embodiment.<br>
In this embodiment, an oxide layer needs to be formed<br>
not in the surface of a steel sheet, but as a so-called internal<br>
oxide layer right below the surface of the matrix. As the<br>
amount of the oxide existing in the surface of a steel sheet<br>
increases, not only the surface-treatability and the coating<br>
adhesion but also the weldability and post-painting corrosion<br>
resistance deteriorate. The region right below the surface<br>
(surface layer) at which the internal oxide layer preferably<br>
extends generally in a range of 0.1~100µm from the surface of<br>
the steel sheet. If the thickness of the region where the Al<br>
oxide exists is less than 0.1µm, the formed amount of the oxide<br>
is so little that the surface oxidation of Al cannot be<br>
inhibited. On the other hand, if the range is greater than<br>
100µm, there is a worry that the mechanical properties of the<br>
steel sheet itself deteriorates.<br>
By making the internal oxidation take place, the Al oxide<br>
not only exists as the internal oxidation layer in the<br>
crystalline grains right below the surface of the matrix, but<br>
also comes to exist in large amounts in the grain boundaries.<br>
The Al oxides existing at the grain boundaries have the effect<br>
of inhibiting the corrosion reaction liable to progress from<br>
the grain boundaries. The oxides existing in the grains also<br>
have the effect of inhibiting the corrosion reaction from<br>
progressing from the grain boundaries into the grains. The<br>
details of this mechanism are unknown. The above-mentioned<br>
effects are enhanced by coexistence of other oxides; therefore,<br>
to have the Al oxides coexist with oxides of Fe, Si, Mn and<br>
P or the like is desirable for the improvement of the corrosion<br>
resistance. Among the oxides of those elements are SiO2, MnO,<br>
FeSiO3, Fe2SiO4, MnSiO3, Mn2SiO4 and P2O5.<br>
The coexistence of those oxides contributes to the<br>
outstanding coating adhesion during press working. It is<br>
presumed that the oxide layers existing in adequate amounts<br>
serve to absorb compressive stresses in press working.<br>
Therefore, the presence of an Al oxide and other oxides is<br>
effective in additionally improving the coating adhesion.<br>
Moreover, the presence of the Al oxide as the internal<br>
oxide layer secures an improved spot welding property. The<br>
reason is considered as follows. Because the Al oxide that<br>
worsens the weldability is fixed as the oxide in the steel and<br>
does not exist in the surface of the steel sheet, a substantive<br>
amount of Al solid solution is decreased and th weldability<br>
is thereby improved.<br>
As has been described, in a steel sheet according to this<br>
embodiment, the internal oxide layer is required to exist right<br>
below the surface of the steel sheet, and to obtain the<br>
above-mentioned effects, the amount of oxides needs to be<br>
0.01g/m2 for each side. However, when the amount of oxides<br>
is over 1.0g/m2, the internal oxidation progresses so much as<br>
to deteriorate the surface treatability and the coating<br>
adhesion, and moreover the roughened surface worsens the<br>
external appearance and degrades the corrosion resistance.<br>
Note that the amount of the internal oxides can be known<br>
by measuring the amount of oxygen in the steel; however, if<br>
a coated layer has already been formed, such as a coating layer,<br>
then the amount of oxygen in the steel is measured after the<br>
coated surface is removed. As for a method for removing the<br>
coating layer, it is possible to use a solution consisting of<br>
an aqUeous solution of 20wt% of NaOH and 10wt% of<br>
triethanolamine and an aqueous solution of 35wt% of H2O2 mixed<br>
in a volume ratio of 195:7 or a dilute HCl solution containing<br>
an inhibitor. Or, other acid or alkali may be used. Note that<br>
attention should be taken to prevent the surface of the steel<br>
sheet from oxidizing after the coating layer has been removed.<br>
When measuring the amount of oxygen in the steel, the amount<br>
of oxygen in the base sheet for the steel sheet needs to be<br>
subtracted; therefore, after the coating layer has been<br>
removed, the amount of oxygen of only the surface layer is<br>
calculated by subtracting the amount of oxygen existing in the<br>
steel obtained from a specimen, the surfaces of both sides of<br>
which have been removed by 100µm or more from the surface by<br>
mechanical grinding, and then by converting the calculated<br>
amount of oxygen into that per unit area, the internal oxide<br>
amount is obtained. The amount of oxygen in the steel can be<br>
obtained by measuring by "Impulse Furnace Melting-Infrared<br>
Absorption", for example. The kinds of oxides can be<br>
identified by using extraction replicas of the cross section<br>
of the steel sheet, and by analyzing them by TEM observation<br>
and EDX. If the amount of oxides formed is so small and it<br>
is difficult to identify, the Br2-methanol method may be used<br>
to extract and ICP analysis may be employed.<br>
The above-mentioned internal oxide layer can be formed<br>
by setting a coiling temperature (CT) after hot-rolling at a<br>
high temperature of not lower than 640°c, or by annealing on<br>
a continuous annealing line (CAL) or on a continuous hot-dip<br>
galvanizing line (CGL) , and in this process by setting the dew<br>
point (DP) of the atmosphere in the annealing furnace on a<br>
rather higher side. In the former case, the internal oxide<br>
layer is formed by oxygen supplied from the skin scale, or in<br>
the latter case, the internal oxide layer is formed by oxygen<br>
formed when H2O in the atmosphere decomposes at the surface<br>
of the steel sheet. Therefore, when the coiling temperature<br>
CT after hot rolling has to be low, the internal oxides may<br>
be formed in the annealing furnace. Above all else, Al is<br>
liable to form internal oxides, so oxidation occurs even at<br>
an ordinary dew point of about (DP = -40~-30°C) , and even when<br>
an added amount is as much as close to 2%, surface segregation<br>
can be impeded sufficiently. However, when the dew point is<br>
below -50°C, internal oxidation becomes less liable to occur.<br>
Therefore, when a steel sheet is coiled at a high coiling<br>
temperature CT, the dew point of the atmosphere in annealing<br>
matters little, but when a steel sheet is coiled at a low CT,<br>
the dew point preferably not lower than -45°C, and more<br>
preferably not lower than -40°C. With regard to Si, Mn and<br>
P in the surface layer, internal oxides of those elements are<br>
formed by setting a high CT or by controlling the dew point<br>
in continuous annealing.<br>
A high strength steel sheet according to the present<br>
invention can be manufactured by using a high CT or by<br>
controlling the dew point in continuous annealing as described<br>
above. Moreover, if a high strength steel sheet according to<br>
the present invention is hot-dip galvanized, a hot-dip<br>
galvanized steel sheet according to this embodiment can be<br>
manufactured.<br>
Next, description will be made of suitable conditions<br>
for annealing and hot-dip galvanizing when manufacturing steel<br>
sheet according to this embodiment.<br>
With regard to annealing conditions on a continuous<br>
annealing line (CAL), it is preferable from a viewpoint of<br>
obtaining high strength that, after recrystallization is made<br>
to occur by heating the steel sheet to an intercritical<br>
temperature (a +g), the steel sheet is overaged at 350~500°C<br>
for two minutes or longer to make C segregate in the austenite,<br>
and bainite transformation is made to occur. When hot-dip<br>
galvanizing a steel sheet, hot-dip galvanizing is carried out<br>
on a steel sheet on which recrystallization and overaging have<br>
been carried out, or after the above-mentioned intercritical<br>
annealing has been done on a continuous hot-dip galvanizing<br>
line (CGL), subsequently a hot-dip galvanizing process may be<br>
performed. In the category of hot-dip galvanized steel sheets,<br>
a hot-dip galvanized steel sheet featuring high strength and<br>
high ductility can be obtained by performing the<br>
above-mentioned intercritical annealing on a steel sheet on<br>
a CAL line, quenching 300°C or lower at a rate of 40°C/sec or<br>
higher to produce a hardened structure consisting of ferrite<br>
and martensite, and then again annealing the steel sheet at<br>
725~840°C on the CGL line and cooling at a rate of 5°C/sec to<br>
obtain a steel sheet of a composite structure of ferrite,<br>
tempered martensite and retained austenite, and subsequently<br>
hot-dip galvanizing the steel sheet, which is the so-called<br>
two-step annealing method.<br>
As the annealing furnaces for CAL and CGL, all radiant<br>
heating tube (RTH) furnaces of so-called full-reducing<br>
atmosphere may be used. For the temperature-rising process,<br>
it is possible to use a non-oxidizing-atmosphere heating<br>
furnace (NOF) or a direct-firing furnace (DFF).<br>
As for a method for applying this embodiment to a hot-dip<br>
galvanized steel sheet, a well-known method may be used. For<br>
example, preferably, the bath temperature is 440~5G0°C, and<br>
the Al concentration in the bath is 0.10~0.20% when a<br>
galvannealing process is carried out, or about 0 .14~0.24% when<br>
a galvannealing process is not carried out. If the Al<br>
concentration is too low, the coating adhesion is inferior in<br>
both cases mentioned above. On the other hand, if the Al<br>
concentration is too high, the weldability is poor when the<br>
galvannealing process is not executed or the galvannealing<br>
reaction is delayed when the galvannealing process is carried<br>
out. To improve the corrosion resistance, Mg may be added to<br>
the galvanizing bath. The coating weight is not specified,<br>
but from a viewpoint of securing the corrosion resistance and<br>
controlling the coating weight, the coating weight is<br>
preferably not less than 10g/m2 or from a viewpoint of<br>
workability, the coating weight is preferably not more than<br>
120g/m2.<br>
Following hot-dip galvanizing, a galvannealing process<br>
may be performed if necessary. The temperature at which the<br>
galvannealing process is carried out is preferably in a range<br>
of 460~550°C. At under 460°C, the galvannealing reaction<br>
progresses slowly, but at 550°C or higher, excess galvannealing<br>
occurs, and a hard and brittle Zn-Fe galvanneal layer is formed<br>
so much at the interface between the coating layer and the<br>
matrix, thus not only deteriorating the coating adhesion, but<br>
decomposing the retained austenite layer and aggravating the<br>
strength-ductility balance. Meanwhile, when the Fe content<br>
in the coating layer after the galvannealing process is under<br>
7%, a soft Zn-Fe galvanneal layer is formed at the surface of<br>
the coating layer, thereby worsening the slidablity. On che<br>
other hand, the Fe content of over 15% is not preferable because<br>
the hard and brittle Fe-Zn galvanneal layer is formed at the<br>
interface of the matrix in the coating layer, lowering the<br>
coating adhesion.<br>
A high strength steel sheet according to this embodiment<br>
may not only be hot-dip galvanized but also may be coated with<br>
hot-dip Zn-5%A1 coating, hot-dip Zn-55%A1 coating, hot-dip Al<br>
coating, or the like. The kind of a steel sheet to which this<br>
embodiment is applied, whether cold-rolled or hot-rolled, does<br>
not matter so long as desired mechanical propert, es can be<br>
obtained.<br>
(Embodiment 1)<br>
A steel slab of a chemical composition shown in Table<br>
9 was heated at 1150°C for 25 minutes in a heating furnace,<br>
then hot-rolled to a thickness of 2 . 8mm, and coiled at 450~780°C<br>
to obtain a hot-rolled strip. Subsequently, with the skin<br>
scale removed by acid cleaning, the strip was cold-rolled to<br>
a thickness of 1.4mm, and subjected to a continuous annealing<br>
annealed at 800~850°C for recrystallization, and overaged at<br>
400~500°C to thereby finish a cold-rolled sheet.<br>
This cold-rolled strip was further subjected to various<br>
kinds of coating, such as electro-galvanizing, electro Zn-Ni<br>
electroplating or Zn phosphating, and the steel sheet was<br>
evaluated in external appearance, coating adhesion (only for<br>
electroplated sheets), and corrosion resistance (only for<br>
Zn-phosphated sheets). The electroplated coating weight was<br>
20g/m2 and the chemical treatment weight was 2g/m2.<br>
The properties of steel sheets obtained as described are<br>
evaluated as follows:<br>
External appearance: Bare spots or the uneven adhesion were<br>
observed visually, and specimens without flaws are decided as<br>
good (o) .<br>
Coating adhesion: Electroplated steel sheets were<br>
subjected to a ball impact test, and then a cellophane tape<br>
was attached to the processed parts and peeled off. Whether<br>
or not the coating layer was peeled off was visually observed,<br>
and "without bare spots" was classified as o, "there are<br>
somewhat bare spots" was classified as D, and "bare spots<br>
occurred conspicuously" was classified as X.<br>
Corrosion resistance: Zn-phosphated steel sheets were<br>
elctrodeposited, a cross was engraved with a knife, and test<br>
specimens were dipped in a 5% NaCl or 55°C salt water for 240<br>
hours, taken out and dried, and tape peeling test was performed<br><br>
on cross-cut portions, and the peeling width was measured.<br>
Those with a peeling width of less than 3.5mm were classified<br>
as good (O) , those with a width of 3. 5mm~under 4mm were<br>
classified as rather good (A), and those with a width of not<br>
less than 4mm were classified as bad (X).<br>
For cold-rolled steel sheets yet to be coated, the<br>
weldability was evaluated as follows.<br>
Weldability test: Two test specimens were spot-welded<br>
together by using a dome-tipped 6-mm dia. welading electrode<br>
under conditions of electrode pressure of 4.3k%, welding<br>
current of 8kA, squeeze time for 25 cycles, setup time for 3<br>
cycles, welding time for 13 cycles, and holding time for 1<br>
cycle; subsequently, a maximum tensile load in a tensile shear<br>
test (TSS) according to JIS Z3136 and a maximum tensile load<br>
in a cross joint tensile test (CTS) according to JIS Z3137 were<br>
measured. Those test specimens for which ductility ratio<br>
(CTS/TSS) was not less than 0.25 and the tensile load (TSS)<br>
was not less than the standard tensile shear load (1162N) for<br>
a thickness of 1.4mm were classified as excellent (O) , and<br>
those not meeting the above conditions were classified as<br>
inferior (X).<br>
On cold-rolled steel sheets before sent to coating, the<br>
amounts of internal oxides were measured by the<br>
above-mentioned method, and the internal oxides were<br>
identified. If an oxide existed in a range up to O.1µn from<br>
the surface, such a case was determined as "presence of oxide".<br>
The test results are shown en bloc in Table 10. As is<br>
clear from this Table, high tension steel sheets according to<br>
the present invention, regardless of large contents of Al and<br>
Si, invariably exhibit excellent surface treatability,<br>
coatability, spot-weldability, and post-painting corrosion<br>
resistance.<br>
(Embodiment 2)<br>
A steel slab of chemical composition shown in Table 9<br>
same as in Embodiment 1 was heated at 1150°C for 25 minutes<br>
in a heating furnace, then hot-rolled to a thickness of 2.8mm,<br>
and coiled at 450~780°C to obtain a hot-rolled strip. After<br>
this, after its skin scale had been removed by acid cleaning,<br>
the strip was cold-rolled to a thickness of 1.2mm, and then<br>
annealed under conditions shown in Table 12 in a CGL line, and<br>
subsequently hot-dip galvanized and subjected to a<br>
galvannealing process at 450~570°C when necessary. The<br>
galvanizing bath temperature was held at 450~460°C, and as for<br>
the galvanizing bath composition, three different<br>
compositions were used: in addition to a Zn bath with Al content<br>
of 0.13~0.20 mass%, a Zn bath with Al content of 5 mass% and<br>
a Zn bath with Al content of 4 mass% and Mg content of 1.5 mass%<br>
were used. The coating weight was adjusted to 50±5g/m2 for<br>
each single side by gas wiping.<br>
An obtained hot-dip galvanized steel sheet was analyzed<br>
to determine the amount of internal oxide and identify oxides<br>
as in Embodiment 1. Also, the external appearance, the degree<br>
of galvannealing (only on galvannealed steel sheets), the<br>
coating adhesion and the corrosion resistance were examined.<br>
Degree of galvannealing: The coating layer was dissolved<br>
in a mixed solution of an aqueous solution of 20wt% of NaOH<br>
and 10wt% of triethanolamine and an aqueous solution of 35wt%<br>
of H2O2 mixed in a volume ratio of 195:7, and the solution is<br>
analyzed by ICP to measure the Fe content (%).<br>
External appearance evaluation: The external appearance<br>
was visually checked to find bare spots or unevenness of<br>
coating.<br>
Coating adhesion:<br>
(Non-alloyed hot-dip galvanized steel sheet) After put<br>
to a ball impact test, a cellophane tape was attached to a<br>
processed part of the steel sheet and the tape was peeled off.<br>
The test specimens were visually inspected to see if there is<br>
any peeled-ff coating layer. Those specimens on which the<br>
coating did not peel off were classified as o, those specimens<br>
with the coating peeled off a little were classified as A, and<br>
those specimens on which the coating peeled off conspicuously<br>
were classified as X.<br>
(Alloyed hot-dip galvanized steel sheet) A test specimen<br>
to which a cellophane tape was attached was bent 90 degrees<br>
on the tape-attached side and bent back, and the tape was peeled<br>
off; subsequently, the amount of the peeled-off coating per<br>
unit length was measured in terms of counts of Zn by a<br>
fluorescent X-ray. The number of counts of Zn was evaluated<br>
referring to the criteria in Table 11. For measurement by<br>
fluorescent X-ray, an Rh bulb was used-under condition of 40kV<br>
and 50mA for 120 sec.<br>
Corrosion resistance: After the surfaces of a steel sheet<br>
manufactured by the above method were subjected to a chemical<br>
treatment process and an electrodeposition process, in test<br>
specimens was inscribed a cross with a knife, and a test<br>
specimen was put to a CCT test for a total of 50 cycles, one<br>
cycle consisting of a series of steps shown below, a<br>
tape-peel-off test was conducted on the cross-inscribed<br>
portions and the peeling-off width of the coating film was<br>
measured. A decision was given as follows: a case where the<br>
peeling-off width was under 4mm was classified as, good (o),<br>
a case where the width was 4mm or larger was classified as<br>
defective (o) .<br>
One cycle consists of wetting (2 hrs) - salt water spray<br>
(2 hrs) - drying (1 hr) - wetting (6 hrs} - drying (2 hrs) -<br>
wetting (6 hrs) - drying (2 hrs) - low temperature (3 hrs).<br>
A cold-rolled steel sheet yet to be galvanized was<br>
evaluated in terms of weldability as follows.<br>
Two test specimens were spot-welded together by using<br>
a dome-tipped 6-mm-dia. Welding electrode under conditions of<br>
electrode pressure of 3.1kN, welding current of 7kA, squeeze<br>
time for 25 cycles, setup time for 3 cycles, welding time for<br>
13 cycles, holding time for 1 cycle; subseguently, a maximum<br>
tensile load in a tensile shear test (TSS) according to JIS<br>
Z3136 and a maximum tensile load in a cross joint tensile test<br>
(CTS) according to JIS Z3137 were measured. Those test<br>
specimens for which the ductility ratio (CTS/TSS) was not less<br>
than 0.25 and the tensile load (TSS) was not less than the<br>
standard tensile shear load (8787N) for a thickness of 1.2mm<br>
were classified as excellent (o), and those not meeting the<br>
above conditions were classified as inferior (X).<br>
The test results are shown en bloc in Table 12. As is<br>
clear from this Table, hot-dip galvanized steel sheets<br>
according to the present invention, regardless of no small<br>
contents of Al and Si, all exhibit excellent coating adhesion,<br>
spot-weldability, and post-painting corrosion resistance.<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
In the automotive industry, for example, the use of<br>
high-tensile steel sheets is increasing rapidly with a view<br>
to reducing car weight for better fuel economy and improved<br>
crashworthiness. The high-tensile steel sheet has a steel<br>
composition including addition elements such as Si, Mn, Ti,<br>
Al and P. It is well known, however, that as the Si content<br>
is increased, an Si oxide film is formed on the surfaces of<br>
the steel sheet during annealing, thus deteriorating the steel<br>
properties, such as chemical properties, electro-galvanized<br>
coating adhesion, hot-dip galvanizability and coating<br>
adhesion. Above all else, the big problem is the inferior<br>
hot-dip galvanizability of Si-containing high-tensile steel<br>
sheets. To be more specific, when a steel sheet is hot-dip<br>
galvanized, its poor wettability causes the applied zinc not<br>
to adhere to some parts of the steel sheet, which are the<br>
so-called "bare spots", or an insufficient adhesion occurs in<br>
which the coating separates during press working. As a method<br>
for achieving high ductility and high tensile strength without<br>
increasing the Si content, there is a technique by which to<br>
positively increase the Al content in the steel to thereby<br>
decrease the Si content, the surface quality deterioration<br>
peculiar to the Si-added steel can be prevented and<br>
simultaneously the retained austenite can be made stable.<br>
However, Al and Si being both readily oxidizable elements,<br>
an Al oxide film is also formed in addition to the Si oxide<br>
film during annealing, and therefore the problems of<br>
deterioration in hot-dip galvanizability and coating adhesion<br>
have not been solved.<br>
According to a coated steel sheet and a method for<br>
manufacturing this steel sheet in the present invention, the<br>
diffusion of Al into the surface layer of the steel sheet is<br>
prevented/ the amount of Al solid solution in the surface layer<br>
is decreased, and desired steel structure and mechanical<br>
properties can be secured. Moreover, the surface treatability,<br>
hot-dip galvanizability, post-painting corrosion resistance,<br>
and weldability can be improved. Furthermore, even if the<br>
steel sheet has a high Al content, a coating can be formed with<br>
excellent adhesion properties.<br>
