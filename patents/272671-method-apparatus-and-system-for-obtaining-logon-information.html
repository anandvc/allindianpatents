				<td>Method, Apparatus and System for Obtaining Logon<br>
Information<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to logon technology in Instant Messaging, and particularly, to a method, apparatus and system for obtaining logon information.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
In existing Internet applications, along with fast development of Instant Messaging (IM), various applications and services based on the IM are popularized and used more and more widely, e.g. a value-added service such as an online game. When the value-added service such as the online game is used, a client used by a user can directly log on a server of the value-added service by using an IM account and can enjoy the relevant value-added service after passing authentication of the server of the value-added service.<br>
By taking an online game as an example, while installing IM software, the user usually installs IM game software corresponding to the IM software at the same time. After the user logs on the IM software, if the user needs to join a certain IM game, the user may start a client of the IM game through clicking a button corresponding to the IM game so as to join the IM game. In other words, after logging on the IM software, the client of the TM game need not provide logon information of a game server but can log on the game server directly.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates a conventional procedure of a game client logging on a game server. The conventional procedure relates to communication and interaction between four entities including an IM client 11, a game client 12, a game authentication server 20 and an IM authentication server 30. As shown in Figure 1, the conventional procedure of the game client logging on the game server includes the following steps.<br>
Step 101: The game client 12, which is started, requests the IM client 11 for logon information by way of inter-process communication. The logon information may be information such as a user account.<br>
 <br>
Step 102: After receiving the request from the game client 12, the IM client 11 returns the logon information of a user to the game client 12 by way of the inter-process communication.<br>
Because the user has logged on the IM software before starting the game client 12, i.e. has started the IM client 11 of the user, and the IM client 11 has obtained the logon information of the user. In this step, the IM client 11 returns the logon information of the user to the game client 12 which initiates the request.<br>
Step 103: After obtaining the logon information of the user, the game client 12 reports the logon information to the game authentication server 20 by way of network communication.<br>
Step 104: The game authentication server 20 sends authentication information to the IM authentication server 30 by way of the network communication.<br>
Herein, the authentication information includes, but is not limited to, a user account, a password, a key, gender, age, a certificate number, an address and a true name.<br>
Step 105: After authenticating the user, the IM authentication server 30 returns an authentication result to the game authentication server 20 by way of the network communication. Herein, the authentication result may be authentication-pass or authentication-failure.<br>
Step 106: The game authentication server 20 returns the authentication result to the game client 12.<br>
Step 107: In the case of the authentication-pass, the game client 12 is allowed to log on the game server and to start a corresponding game.<br>
As can be seen from the above procedure, the game client obtains the logon information such as the user account from the IM client by way of the inter-process communication. In other words, a communication mode between the IM client and the game client is pre-configured, and the IM client cannot add or change the communication process at any moment according to the update of the game client. If a new game client is issued, the new game client can not communicate with the IM client because no<br>
 <br>
communication process is created between the new game client and the IM client. The new game client can not log on the game server until a communication process is created between the new game client and the IM client, for example, until the version of the IM client is upgraded.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
An embodiment of the present invention provides a method, system and apparatus for obtaining logon information, which can easily and conveniently realize communication and interaction between a new client and an IM client.<br>
According to an embodiment, a method for obtaining logon information includes: receiving, by a function plug-in, a request for logon information from a value-added<br>
service client;<br>
sending, by a function plug-in, the request for the logon information to an Instant<br>
Messaging (IM) client corresponding to the value-added service client;<br>
receiving, by a function plug-in, the logon information from the IM client; and sending, by a function plug-in, the logon information to the value-added service<br>
client.<br>
According to another embodiment, an apparatus for obtaining logon information includes:<br>
a first module, adapted to receive a request for logon information from a value-added service client corresponding to the apparatus;<br>
a second module, adapted to send the request for the logon information to an Instant Messaging (IM) client corresponding to the value-added service client;<br>
a third module, adapted to receive the logon information from the IM client; and<br>
a fourth module, adapted to send the logon information to the value-added service client.<br>
According to another embodiment, a system for obtaining logon information includes;<br>
a value-added service client, adapted to send a request for logon information, and receive the logon information from a function plug-in;<br>
 <br>
the function plug-in, adapted to receive the request for the logon information from the value-added service client corresponding to the function plug-in, and send the request for the logon information to an Instant Messaging (IM) client corresponding to the value-added service client; receive the logon information from the IM client; send the logon information to the value-added service client;<br>
the IM client, adapted to receive the request for the logon information from the function plug-in, and send the logon information to the function plug-in.<br>
In the embodiment of the present invention, the function plug-in corresponding to the value-added service client is configured and the function plug-in can communicate with the IM client by using the common interface. Therefore, the value-added service client can obtain the logon information from the IM client through the function plug-in so as to log on the value-added service server.<br>
Through embodiments of the present invention, when a new value-added service client is issued, it is just needed to add a new function plug-in corresponding to the new value-added service client and register the new function plug-in while installing the new value-added service, while it is not necessary to make any change to the existing IM client. Therefore, the new value-added service client can interact with the IM client through the new function plug-in, and then obtain the logon information. The new plug-in interacts with the IM client by using the common interface, thereby enabling the new value-added service client to obtain the logon information easily, flexibly and conveniently and then log on the value-added service server.<br>
In addition, on one hand, different function plug-ins may be respectively added according to different value-added service clients and different function requirements in the embodiments of the present invention. Therefore, the communication and interaction between the IM client and any game client can be implemented and the expansibility of the IM client is improved. On the other hand, the function plug-in in the embodiments of the present invention adopts the uniform common interface to communicate and interact with the IM client, and therefore, as long as the IM client is capable of providing the common interface for the function plug-in, the function plug-in can interact with various different IM clients, such as American IM (AIM). Even if the function plug-in or the game client is upgraded or updated, the AIM client need not be changed either. When a<br>
 <br>
new value-added service client is added, it is just needed to add a new function plug-in. Therefore, the adaptability of the value-added service client is improved and the popularization of the value-added service client is accelerated.<br>
In addition, in the case of interacting with the IM client bearing different IM systems, as long as a current user has account information of a currently-used IM system, the current user can interact with the currently-used IM client through the function plug-in, obtain current account information of the user, and then log on game clients of other IM systems by using the current account information to play a game. Therefore, the process of applying for an account and inputting a game account password is avoided, thus lowering the complexity of the procedure, simplifying the procedure and facilitating operations of the user.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, a function plug-in corresponding to a value-added service client is configured. The function plug-in can adopt a common interface to communicate with an IM client, which thereby enables the value-added service client to obtain logon information from the IM client through the function plug-in and then log on a game server.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the function plug-in is a set including at least one function program, may be configured according to function requirements of a corresponding game client and invoke the common interface according to requirements. Further, communication and interaction between the function plug-in and the IM client<br>
 <br>
adopt a uniform common interface.<br>
As a simple example, the IM client configures one common interface as follows: interface       lAccImSession<br>
{<br>
HRESULT    Sendlm( name, content);<br>
}<br>
The above common interface is used to send a piece of IM information to a user. When the function plug-in needs to invoke the above common interface, it is only required to execute corresponding pseudo-codes, e.g.<br>
void PluginSendIm(name, content)<br>
{<br>
lAccImSession pim = GetlAccImSessionQ;<br>
pIra-&gt;SendIm(name, content); }<br>
Through the above pseudo-codes, the function plug-in can obtain an lAccImSession interface pointer provided by an IM client and send a piece of IM information (content) to a user (name).<br>
By analogy, the IM client can define a variety of common interfaces according to practical requirements, and the function plug-in only needs to invoke a corresponding common interface in a similar manner when it is necessary.<br>
As can be seen from the above example, as long as the IM client used currently by the user can provide a uniform common interface, the function plug-in can communicate and interact with the IM client by using the common interface. Correspondingly, if a value-added service client is added or updated, it is only necessary to configure a function plug-in corresponding to the added or updated value-added service according to function requirements. While the added or updated value-added service is loaded, the corresponding function plug-in is also loaded simultaneously. Thus, the new value-added service client or the updated value-added service client can establish the communication interaction with the IM client through the function plug-in, and thereby can obtain the logon information, log on the value-added service server and proceed to subsequent<br>
 <br>
processing.<br>
Hereinafter, an embodiment of the present invention is described by taking a game as an example of the value-added service.<br>
Figure 2 is illustrates a structure of a system for logging on a game server according to an embodiment of the present invention. As shown in Figure 2, the system includes a client 10 and a server side. The client 10 includes an IM client 11, a game client 12 and a function plug-in 13. The server side includes a game authentication server 20 and an IM authentication server 30.<br>
The IM client 11 is adapted to make a user logon by using an IM account and automatically load a registered IM plug-in of a system. The game client 12 is adapted to communicate with the game authentication server 20, and report logon information of the user, such as account information of the user, to the game authentication server 20. The game authentication server 20 is adapted to send authentication information corresponding to the logon information of the user reported by the game client 12 to the IM authentication server 30. The IM authentication server 30 is adapted to authenticate whether the authentication information sent by the game authentication server 20 corresponds to a valid user, for example, whether the authentication information corresponds to a valid IM account. The function plug-in 13 is adapted to obtain the logon information of the user from the IM client 11, and perform inter-process communication with the game client 12 to send the logon information of the user to the game client 12. When the IM client 11 corresponds to multiple game clients including the game client 12 simultaneously, the registered IM plug-in of the IM client 11 may be the function plug-in 13 corresponding to the game client 12, or function plug-ins corresponding to the other game clients.<br>
In practical applications, the function plug-in 13 may be an independent entity or a function module configured inside the game client 12 or the IM client 11.<br>
Based on the system shown in Figure 2, a procedure of logging on a game server according to an embodiment of the present invention is illustrated in Figure 3, and includes the following steps.<br>
 <br>
Step 301: The game client 12, which is started, requests the function plug-in 13 for logon information of a current user by way of inter-process communication. The logon information may be information such as a user account.<br>
Step 302: After receiving the request from the game client 12, the function plug-in 13 requests the IM client 11 for the logon information of the current user by invoking a common interface.<br>
Step 303: After receiving the request from the function plug-in 13, the IM client 11 returns the logon information of the current user to the function plug-in 13 through the common interface.<br>
Because the user has logged on IM software before starting the game client 12, i.e. the user has started the IM client 11, the IM client 11 has obtained the logon information of the user. In this step, the IM client 11 returns the logon information of the user to the function plug-in 13 which initiates the request.<br>
Step 304: After receiving the logon information of the user, the function plug-in 13 returns the logon information of the user to the game client 12 by way of inter-process communication.<br>
Step 305: After obtaining the logon information of the user, the game client 12 reports the logon information to the game authentication server 20 by way of network communication.<br>
Step 306: The game authentication server 20 sends authentication information to the IM authentication server 30 by way of the network communication.<br>
Herein, the authentication information is information for authenticating whether a user is valid and includes, but is not limited to, a user account, a password, a key, gender, age, a certificate number, an Email address, a correspondence address and a true name.<br>
Step 307: After authenticating the user, the IM authentication server 30 returns an authentication result to the game authentication server 20 by way of the network communication. The authentication result may be authentication-pass or authentication-failure.<br>
 <br>
Step 308: The game authentication server 20 returns the authentication result to the game client 12.<br>
Step 309: In the case of authentication-pass, the game client 12 is allowed to log on the game server and start a corresponding game. In the case of authentication-failure, a prompt that game server logon fails is provided, and a prompt for logging again may also be provided.<br>
As can be seen, with respect to the IM client capable of providing a uniform common interface, the function plug-in of the embodiments of the present invention can communicate and interact with it by invoking the common interface and thereby obtain the logon information. When a new value-added service client is issued, it is just needed to add a new function plug-in corresponding to the new value-added service client and register the new function plug-in while installing the new value-added service, while it is not necessary to make any change to the existing IM client. Therefore, the method and system for obtaining the logon information are applicable to various different instant messaging systems, such as AIM and Tencent QQ.<br>
The foregoing is only embodiments of the present invention. The protection scope of the present invention, however, is not limited to the above description. Any change or substitution, easily occurring to those skilled in the art, should be covered by the protection scope of the present invention.<br>
