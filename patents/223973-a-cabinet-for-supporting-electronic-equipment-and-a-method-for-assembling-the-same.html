Using this internal concept the strength/rigidity of the framework can effectively be increased as and where necessary to support whatever internal loading arrangements required by the customer.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 1, 6, 7 and 8, the external assembly structure 14 is shown having four post trims 70 identical in construction and function and three panels 74 connected to the post trims 70. However, it should be understood that the present invention may be constructed in a variety of ways having at least two post trims connected to the internal assembly structure and at least one panel connected to the post trims.<br>
Each post trim 70 is connected to each of the corner posts 18 of the internal assembly structure 12. Each of the post trims 70 has a body member 80, a first connector 82, and a second connector 84. The body member 80 has a first side 86 and a second side 88. The first connector 82 is connected to the first side 86 of the body member 80. The second connector 84 is connected to the second side 88 of the body member 80. The first connector 82 and the second connector 84 cooperate between an unsecured position (FIG. 7) and a secured position (FIG. 8) to connect the post trim 70 to the post 18.<br><br>
The first connector 82 has an L-shaped flange 90 extending from the body member 80 and a shoulder 92 spaced a distance away from the L-shaped flange 90 to form a channel 96. The channel 96 is sized and dimensioned to matingly receive an edge 98 of one of the panels 74.<br>
The second connector 84 has an L-shaped flange 100 extending from the body member 80 and a shoulder 102 spaced a distance away from the L-shaped flange 100 to form a channel 104. The channel 104 is sized and dimensioned to matingly receive an edge 98 of one of the panels 74.<br>
The panel 74, in a preferred embodiment, is a flat, rectangular- shaped piece which is positioned between two posts 18 and connected to the post trim 70. However, it should be understood that the panel 74 may be formed into any shape necessary in providing interconnection between two posts.<br>
Referring to FIG. 9, a door 110 shaped like the panel 74 is received by the post trim 70 in place of the panel 74. A pivot point 112 is provided for opening and closing the door 110. It should be understood that the present invention accommodates single or a double doors. Additionally, different ventilation and material variations can be applied. Hinge types and locking systems can vary also depending on the door requirement. An electromagnetic containment (EMC) seal 114 is shown situated between the door 110 and the post trim 70. Sufficient compression is ensured by plastic compression blocks 116.<br><br>
To assemble the cabinet 10, the tab from each post 18 is positioned in the corresponding slot formed in the lower panel 20a and the upper panel 20b. The post 18 is then secured in this position via a connection assembly 118 (see FIG. 3). In one preferred embodiment, the connection assembly 118 includes a tie bar 120, a pair of tension spreader plates 122, and a plurality of nuts 124 and washers 126. The tie bar 120 extends through the post 18, and first and seconds ends 128 and 130 of the tie bar 120 extend through openings 132a and 132b formed in the lower panel 20a and the upper panel 20b. The tension spreader plates 122, the washers 126 and the nuts 124 are positioned on the tie bar 120 adjacent the first and second ends 128 and 130 so that the tension spreader plates 122 are positioned generally between the nuts 124 and the respective upper and lower panels 20a and 20b. This process is repeated to connect each of the posts 18 to the upper and lower panels 20a and 20b.<br>
The chassis structure 17 is positioned in the cavity 16 and connected to the posts 18 with the twin axis mounting system 50. Next, each post trim 70 is connected to each post 18. The L-shaped flange 90 of the first connector 82 engages the first portion 21 of the post 18 placing the post trim 70 in an unsecured position, as shown in FIG. 7. The L-shaped flange 100 of the second connector 84 engages the second portion 23 of the post 18 connecting the post trim 70 to the post 18 and thereby placing the post trim 70 in a secured position (FIG. 8). The edge 98 of the panel 74 is positioned in the channel 104. The channel 104 matingly receives the edge 98 of the panel 74.   The process<br><br>
is repeated on each corner until the post trim 70 is connected to each post 18. In the preferred embodiment, the post trims 70 'snap-on' to the posts 18 while the edge 98 of the panel is positioned in the channel 104 to simultaneously captivate the side and rear panels 74 using the compression fittings 116.<br>
The captivated side/rear panel concept provides precise ingress protection (IP) compression seals to protect the internal equipment from water and dust and other environmental hazards, and EMC seals in the vertical axis to prevent unwanted electromagnetic radiation from escaping the cabinet.<br>
In one preferred embodiment, the side panel is 20mm deep, the EMC/IP seals are 4mm, the captivating slot in the extrusion is 22mm. This results in a minimum of 2mm of compression on the seals when the panel is captivated providing for a maximum 50% compression of the seals. At this level of compression, there is minimal risk of over or under compression of the seals, which can drastically reduce the effectiveness of seals.<br>
The same compression is achieved in the seals utilized in the horizontal plane by use of horizontal clamping/compression brackets. Positively located horizontal clamping/compression brackets ensure precise compression of IP and EMC seals in horizontal axis.<br>
Both indoor and outdoor embodiments of the present invention use the same principal as described herein. However, the raw materials used are chosen to fit the environmental conditions to which the enclosure will be exposed.  By way of example, and not as a limitation, the side panel used in an<br><br>
indoor application may be acceptably fabricated from 0.8mm Zintec while a side panel for outdoor use would be fabricated from 2.0mm aluminum.<br>
The present invention is further adaptable to various roof and top panel designs. Cable entry can be made in the side, rear, and roof/top panels as required. Additionally, a range of standard heat management systems can be fitted both internally and externally as required.<br>
The precision location of the corner post to the base/top panel/plate ensures consistently accurate placement and fixing of the frame structure. The folded box section construction gives the strength of a standard box section, but without the need to machine holes and cutout profiles on dedicated machines or use more expensive welding or extruding equipment. All holes and profiles are generated while the sheet is flat. The modular nature of the construction makes the present invention suitable for use with "flat pack" assemblies.<br>
The cabinet 10 is provided with modular construction and is typically configured for supporting electronic equipment 120, such as a server or telecom equipment The cabinet 10 can be shipped when unassembled and then assembled on-site without any sacrifice of structural integrity or quality of the finally assembled cabinet 10. The cabinet 10 is typically suppfied complete with front/rear doors, side panels, top and base plates, fan plate assembly, adjustable feet, grounding kit, depth members and adjustable mounting verticals.   Other optional accessory parts, include plain/vented front panels,<br><br>
cable trays, chassis runners, sliding shelves, fixed shelves, front stabilizing foot, and castors.<br>
