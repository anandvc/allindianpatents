BACKGROUND OF THEN INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to an emulsifiable concentrate comprising an active ingredient being a dinitroaniline compound, preferably selected from the group consisting of pendimethalin, trifluralin and mixtures thereof. The emulsifiable concentrate of the invention avoids crystallization at low temperature when the concentration of the active ingredient is high.<br>
Emulsifiable concentrates (EC) are liquid compositions comprising an active ingredient in a liquid form, for example an active ingredient having a biological effect on plants (agricultural active). Emulsifiable concentrates usually have a single phase. Emulsifiable concentrates are to be mixed with water, in order to obtain a direct emulsion having a liquid hydrophobic phase comprising the active ingredient dispersed in water. For example a farmer would mix an emulsifiable concentrate comprising a hydrophobic agricultural active with water and readily obtain an emulsion to be applied onto a field. This procedure, where the farmer prepares from a concentrated composition the final product to be applied onto a field, is usually referred to as a "tank mix" procedure. An emulsifiable concentrate is also referred to as a "tank mix" composition.<br>
Pendimethalin and trifluralin are herbicide compounds. Emulsifiable concentrates comprising an active ingredient selected form the group consisting of pendimethalin, trifluralin and mixtures thereof are known. For example some emulsifiable concentrates comprising 330 g/l of pendimethalin, emulsifiers, and a solvent are known. However more concentrated pendimethalin crystallizes at low temperatures, in emulsion concentrates or when mixing with water is performed. The crystallization is characterized by formation of small solid particles of pendimethalin. These small particles have the bad impact of: filters clogging, nozzles clogging, creating unnecessary hazardous waste problems to dispose off the crystals, loss of activity, and/or bad repartition of the active on the field.<br>
The invention relates to an emulsifiable concentrate avoiding to some extent crystallization problems, at pendimethalin and/or trifluralin concentrations of up to 435 g/l or even more.<br>

EP 1025757 discloses composition comprising DBE which is a mixture of dimethvi adipate, dimethyl glutarate, dimethyl succinate. EP 1025757 does not disclose mixtures of diisobutyl compounds.<br>
US 5,092,918 discloses solid compositions comprising diisobutyl adipate- US 5, 092,918 does not disclose emulsifiabie concentrates (liquids) and does not disclose mixtures of diisobutyl compounds.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The emulsifiabie  concentrate according to the  invention comprises an  active ingredient   being   a   dinitroanifine   compound,   preferably   selected   from   the   group consisting of pendimethalin, trifluralin and mixtures thereof, an emulsifier or an etnulsifier mixture,  and a  solvent,  wherein  it comprises (further to the solvent) an amount (preferably an effective amount) of a diester co-solvent having the following formula: R1OOC-(CH2)n-COORz, wherein:<br>
-	R1 and R2, identical or different, are C.-C10, preferably C,-Cs, linear or branched, alkyl, aryl, alkaryl or arylalkyl groups, and<br>
-	n is an average number of from 2 to 4.<br>
The invention also relates to a method for preparing an emulsion of an active ingredient being a dinitroanifine compound, preferably selected from the group consisting of pendimethalin, trifluralin and mixtures thereof in water, comprising the step of mixing 1 part by volume of the emulsifiabie concentrate, with at leas! 10 parts of water, preferably with at least 15 parts, for example 19 or 20 parts, by volume of water.<br>
The invention also relates to an emulsion comprising:<br>
-	an active ingredient being a dinitroanifine compound, preferably selected from the group consisting of pendimethalin, trifluralin and mixtures thereof,<br>
-	an emulsifier or a mixture of emulsifiers,<br>
-	a solvent,<br>
-	a diester co-sotvent having the following formula:<br>
R'OOC-(CH2)n-COOR2,<br>
3<br><br>
wherein:<br>

-	n is an average number of from 2 to 4, and<br>
-	water.<br>
The emulsifiable concentrate according to the invention avoids crystallization problems at low temperature and/or at high level of actives, in the emulsifiable concentrate itself or when mixing with water. For example it can avoid crystallization problems at below 0°C and concentrations of up to 435 g/l, prior to mixing with water. The emulsifiable concentrate, the emulsions formed therefrom, and the emulsion according to the invention have moreover a good biological activity (selective herbicidal activity for destroying most annual grasses and many annual broad-level weeds) and/or a low toxicity.<br>
