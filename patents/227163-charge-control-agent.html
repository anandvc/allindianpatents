				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Electrophotographic processes are used to form images on substrates.<br>
Common electrophotographic processes are photocopying and laser printing. In<br>
these processes, a latent charge image is created. A toner is applied to the image,<br>
and the image is developed and is transferred to a substrate. The substrate can be<br>
anything that accepts the image, such as paper, textiles, plastic, or foils. The image<br>
is permanently affixed to the substrate by one or more of the following methods,<br>
heat, pressure, irradiation, or exposure to solvents.<br>
The toner generally contains a binder, a colorant, an electrostatically<br>
chargeable component, and other auxiliary compounds. Toners need to be capable<br>
of acquiring and maintaining an electrical charge to allow the toner particles to be<br>
electrostatically bound to the image area until the toner can be fixed to the<br>
substrate.<br>
Generally, the electrical charge is imparted to the toner by means of tribo-<br>
electric charging. Tribo-electric charging is static electric charge that is built up by<br>
the motion of the particles being stirred or otherwise flowing over one another.<br>
The tribo-electric charge is normally introduced in the toner by the addition of a<br>
charge control agent, which is a material capable of building and holding a charge.<br>
Charge control agents can be azo-metal dye complexes, quaternary amine salts,<br>
polymeric salts, or triphenylmethanes. The charge control agents may me colored<br>
or colorless depending on their structure.<br>
Solvent Blue 23 is may be used as a pigment in printing inks. Solvent Blue<br>
23 can be sulfonated to form Pigment Blue 61, which is normally used as a<br>
pigment in printing inks. Pigment Blue 61 is a mixture of sulfonation products. In<br>
the printing ink field, Solvent Blue 23 is generally sulfonated from 50 to 100% by<br>
mole fraction of the Solvent Blue 23 to form Pigment Blue 61. For some printing<br>
ink applications, the degree of sulfonation can be as low as 30%. Sulfonation can<br>
be accomplished by the methods disclosed in United States Patent No. 4,944,806 to<br>
Sharangpani et al., which is incorporated herein by reference.<br><br>
Attempts have been made to use Pigment Blue 61 as a charge control agent<br>
(see United States Patent No. 5,061,585 to Macholdt et al. at column 3, lines 31-52<br>
and column 5, line 58 to column 6, line 2). Using Pigment Blue 61 at standard<br>
levels of sulfonation did not provide good results. This Pigment Blue 61 typically<br>
has a sulfonation level between 45 to 90%, and is usually 55 to 75%.<br>
It would be desirable to have a charge control agent that provides a desired<br>
positive charge level.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a composition comprising a toner binder<br>
and a charge control agent comprising a sulfonation product of Solvent Blue 23,<br>
wherein from greater than 0 up to 30 mole % of the Solvent Blue 23 is sulfonated.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
As used throughout, ranges are used as a shorthand for describing each and<br>
every value that is within the range. Any value within the range can be selected as<br>
the terminus of the range. When used, the phrase "at least one of refers to the<br>
selection of any one member individually or any combination of the members.<br>
The conjunction "and" or "or" can be used in the list of members, but the "at least<br>
one of phrase is the controlling language. For example, at least one of A, B, and<br>
C is shorthand for A alone, B alone, C alone, A and B, B and C, A and C, or A and<br>
B and C.<br>
Provided is a composition comprising a toner binder and a charge control<br>
agent. The charge control agent is a sulfonation product of Solvent Blue 23.<br>
Generally, the charge control agent is present in the composition in an amount<br>
from about 0.25 to about 5 % by weight of the total toner composition, and is<br>
preferably 0.5 to 2% by weight.<br>
Solvent Blue 23 is a generic name for a mixture of CAS 2152-64-9<br>
(Benzenamine,	N-phenyl-4-[[4-(phenylamino)phenyl][4-(phenylimino)-2,5-<br>
cyclohexadien-l-ylidene]methyl]-) and CAS 22244-16-2 (Benzenamine, 4,4"-[[4-<br>
(phenylimino)-2,5-cyclohexadien-l-ylidene]methylene]bis[N-phenyl-) and each<br>
contain the following structure:<br><br><br><br>
(Id)	(Ie)<br>
Materials present in the sulfonation product of Solvent Blue 23 include the<br>
following:<br><br>
Pigment Blue 61 is a generic name for mixture of these sulfonation<br>
products and Solvent Blue 23. The amount of (II), (III), and (IV) present in a total<br>
amount of Solvent Blue 23, (II), (III), and (IV) is from greater than 0 to 30% by<br>
mole fraction. Preferably, the amount is from 5 to 20% by mole fraction. In an<br>
amount of (II), (III), and (IV), the amount of either (III) or (IV) is preferably no<br>
more than 10% by weight. In a preferred embodiment, the amount of Solvent Blue<br>
23 is about 85%, the amount of (II) is about 13-15%, the amount of (III) is less<br>
than about 1%, and the amount of (IV) is less than about 1% each by weight of a<br>
total amount of Solvent Blue 23, (II), (III), and (IV).<br>
The central methane in the structures can exist as a salt. With sulfonation,<br>
typical salts would be sulfate, bi-sulfate, or hemi-sulfate. The salt could also be<br>
another salt, which includes, but is not limited to, fluoride, chloride, nitrate,<br>
tetrafluoroborate, or hexaflurophosphate.<br><br>
By controlling the degree of sulfonation of the Solvent Blue 23, a charge<br>
control agent is formed that has a desired level of charge capacity for a toner<br>
composition. Generally, it is desired for a charge control agent to have a charge<br>
capacity of at least about 25 μC/g. The sulfonation product of this invention can<br>
provide a charge capacity of from about 25 to about 45 μC/g, and preferably at<br>
least 30 μC/g. Charge capacity can be measured using the cascade charge<br>
measurement method listed below. Generally, charging capacities are measured at<br>
1% by weight loading level of charge control agent in the toner composition.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the charge control agent is amorphous. The<br>
mixture can have up to about 10% crystallinity as measured by X-ray diffraction.<br>
Toner binders include any binder that is used for toner compositions.<br>
Examples of these binders include, but are not limited to, (co)polymers of vinyl<br>
aromatics, (co)polymers of (meth)acrylates, (co)polymers of (meth)acrylonitrile,<br>
(co)polymers of vinyl ketones, (co)polymers of vinyl ethers, phenol-formaldehyde<br>
resins, oil modified epoxy resins, polyurethane resins, cellulose resins, polyether<br>
resins, polyesters, and combinations thereof.<br>
The composition can contain any additional materials that are included in<br>
toner compositions as an additive.<br>
CASCADE CHARGE MEASUREMENT<br>
A styrene acrylic acid resin (such as CPR-200) is placed in a mixer<br>
containing a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of toluene/2-butanone with the styrene acrylic acid<br>
constituting 5% (w/w) of the mixture. This mixture is then stirred until the resin is<br>
fully dissolved, at which point sufficient charge control agent (CCA ) is added to<br>
the mixture to represent 1% of the resin present. This is then stirred until the CCA<br>
is totally dissolved, as evidenced by the absence of any particles. A stainless steel<br>
plate is then dipped into the solution and fully coated with the resin/CCA solution.<br>
This is then allowed to air dry and then dried in a 70°C oven for a minimum of one<br>
hour. The stainless steel plate coated with a dry matrix of styrene/acrylic acid<br>
containing 1% CCA is then mounted on a poly tetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) block at<br>
a 60° angle in a Toshiba Cascade Charge Measurement unit. A stream of ferrite<br>
beads (diameter 74 - 147 microns) is then allowed to cascade onto the plate at a<br>
fixed rate under the force of gravity and after five minutes the accumulated charge<br>
is measured.<br><br>
SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention is further described in the following examples. The<br>
examples are merely illustrative and do not in any way limit the scope of the<br>
invention as described and claimed.<br>
EXAMPLE 1: To an agitated, jacketed vessel, charged 1700 parts of 95%<br>
sulfuric acid, 170 parts of glacial acetic acid , and 30 parts of water. Cooled the<br>
mixture to 10°-20°C and then rapidly added 440 parts of crude Solvent Blue 23.<br>
Maintained the temperature in the range of 20° - 25°C. After the solids addition<br>
was completed, allowed the mixture to stir for 30-180 minutes at temperature.<br>
Applied heat to the vessel and allowed the temperature to rise to between 55°C and<br>
75°C. Monitored the progress of the reaction until the desired degree of<br>
sulfonation was achieved. Upon completion of the sulfonation phase, immediately<br>
quenched the reaction and isolated the product by drowning the sulfonation mass<br>
into 5000 -10000 parts of 20°C water under high turbulence conditions. Filtered<br>
and wash the product free of any residual acid or soluble organic material. The<br>
product was then dried. The product was added to a toner composition at 1 % by<br>
weight of the composition and the charge capacity was measured. The charge<br>
capacity was 32 μC/gram.<br>
EXAMPLE 2: Same as Example 1, except that 200 parts of water were<br>
used instead of 170 parts acetic acid and 30 parts water. The product was added to<br>
a toner composition at 1% by weight of the composition and the charge capacity<br>
was measured. The charge capacity was 31.5 μC/gram.<br>
PROPHETIC EXAMPLE 3: Same as Example 1, except that butyric acid<br>
is used instead of acetic acid.<br>
PROPHETIC EXAMPLE 4: Same as Example 1, except that propionic<br>
acid is used instead of acetic acid.<br>
PROPHETIC EXAMPLE 5: To a vessel, add simultaneously a sulfuric acid<br>
mixture [a mixture containing 1700 parts of sulfuric cid, 170 parts of acetic acid<br>
(or propionic acid or butyric acid) and thirty parts of water] and finely ground<br>
Solvent Blue 23 in a 3.5:1 ratio. This mixture of acid and dye is then passed<br>
through a mill and into a tubular reactor operating at 60° - 70°C. The reaction<br>
mixture is then quenched by drowning the sulfonation mass through a high<br>
turbulence mixing nozzle with a volume of water equal to 5000 -10000 parts of<br><br>
20°C water. Filter and wash the product free of any residual acid or soluble<br>
organic material. The product is then dried.<br>
