				<td>This invention relates to 2-substituted indoles, and associated compositions, methods for use as therapeutic agents, and methods of preparation thereof.<br>
The actions of the neurotransmitter S-hydroxytrj"ptamine (5-HT) as a major modulatory neurotransmitter in the brain, are mediated through a number of receptor families termed 5-HTl, 5-HT2,5- HT3, 5-HT4, 5-HT5,5-HT6, and 5-HT7  Based on a high level of 5-HT6 receptor mRNA in the brain, it has been stated that the 5-HT6 receptor may play a role in the pathology and treatment of central nerve system disorders. In particular, 5-HT6 selective Hgands have been identified as potentially useM in the treatment of certain CNS disorders such as Parkinson"s disease, Huntington"s disease, anxieity, depression, manic depression, psychoses, epilepsy, obsessive compulsive disorders, migraine, Alzheimer"s disease (enhancement of cognitive memory), sleep disorders, feeding disorders such as anorexia and bulimia, panic attacks, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), attention deficit disorder (ADD), withdrawal from drug abuse such as cocaine, ethanol, nicotine and benzodiazepines, schizophrenia, and also disorders associated with spinal trauma and/or head injury such as hydrocephalus. Such compounds are also expected to be of use in the treatment of certain gastrointestinal (GI) disorders such as functional bowel disorder. See for example, B.L. Roth et al., /. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 1994,268, pages 1403-14120, D. R. Sibley et al., Mol. Pharmacol, 1993,43,320-327, A.J. Sleight et al.. Neurotransmission, 1995,11,1-5, and A. J. Sleight et alâ€ž Serotonin ID Research Alert, 1997,2(3), 115-8. 5-HT6 antagonists have also been identified as potentially usefiil compounds for treatment of obesity.

Exemplary hydroxy protecting groups include, but are not limited to benzyl, silyl groups, tetrahydropyranyl, esters, and the like. The artisan in the art will know how to chose a group for the ease of removal and for the abilit)"" to withstand the following reactions.<br>
"Solvates" means solvent additions forms that contain either stoichiometric or non stoichiometric amounts of solvent. Some compounds have a tendency to trap a fixed molar ratio of solvent molecules in the crystalline solid state, thus forming a solvate. If the solvent is water the solvate formed is a hydrate, when the solvent is alcohol, the solvate formed is an alcoholate. Hydrates are formed by the combination of one or more molecules of water with one of the substances in which the water retains its molecular state as H2O, such combination being able to form one or more hydrate.<br>
"Subject" means mammals and non-mammals. Mammals means any member of the mammalia class including, but not limited to, humans; non-human primates such as chimpanzees and other apes and monkey species; farm animals such as cattle, horses, sheep, goats, and swine; domestic animals such as rabbits, dogs, and cats; laboratory animals including rodents, such as rats, mice, and guinea pigs; and the like.

Compounds of the present invention can be made by a variety of methods depicted in the illustrative synthetic reaction schemes shown and described below.<br>
The starting materials and reagents used in preparing these compounds generally are either available from commercial suppliers, such as Aldrich Chemical Co., or are<br>
LO    prepared by methods known to those skilled in the art following procedures set forth in references such as Fieser and Fieser"s Reagents for Organic Synthesis; Wiley &amp; Sons: New York, 1991, Volumes 1-15; Rodd"s Chemistry of Carbon Compounds, Elsevier Science Publishers, 1989, Volumes 1-5 and Supplementals; and Organic Reactions, Wiley &amp; Sons: New York, 1991, Volumes 1-40. The following synthetic reaction schemes are merely<br>
15    illustrative of some methods by which the compounds of the present invention can be synthesized, and various modifications to these synthetic reaction schemes can be made and will be suggested to one skilled in the art having referred to the disclosure contained in this Application.<br>
The starting materials and the intermediates of the synthetic reaction schemes can 20    be isolated and purified if desired using conventional techniques, including but not limited to, filtration, distillation, crystallization, chromatography, and the like. Such materials can be characterized using conventional means, including physical constants and spectral data.<br>
Unless specified to the contrary, the reactions described herein preferably are 25     conducted under an inert atmosphere at atmospheric pressure at a reaction temperature range of from about -78 Â°C to about 150 Â°C, more preferably from about 0 Â°C to about 125 Â°C, and most preferably and conveniently at about room (or ambient) temperature, e.g., about 20 Â°C.<br>
In one embodiment, Compounds of Formula I, are prepared by deprotonating a 30    sub stituted indole of the formula:<br><br><br>
II<br>
with a base and adding a sulfonylating agent of the formula: Y-SO2-R", where R", R^andR^ are those defined herein, R^ is alkyl or -C(=0)-R^, where R^ is that defined herein, and Y is a leaving group, preferably halide, and more preferably fluoride. It 5    should be appreciated that when R^ and/or R^ has one or more acidic protons (relative to the base used), it should be protected with an appropriate protecting group. Suitable protecting groups for such acidic protons are well known to one skilled in the art and depends on the nature of the acidic proton, e.g., whether it is an amino proton or hydroxy proton, etc.<br>
10	The base should be strong enough to deprotonate primarily the 2-position of the<br>
indole ring system. Such bases are well known to one skilled in the art and include organometallic compounds such as organolithiums, for example, tert-butyllithium, and Grignard reagents, for example, tert-butylmagnesium halide. Generally, the deprotonation reaction is conducted at a temperature of about 0 Â°C or below, preferably<br>
15    about -40 Â°C or below, and more preferably about -70 Â°C or below. Typically, the deprotonation reaction is conducted at about -75 Â°C.<br>
Suitable sulfonylating agent include arylsulfonylhalides, for example, arylsulfonylfluorides. Arylsulfonylfluorides can be readily prepared from the corresponding arylsulfonylchlorides by treatment with a fluoride source, such as<br>
20    potassium fluoride or other suitable metaUic fluoride compounds. Conversion of the arylsulfonylchloride to its corresponding fluoride derivative typically involves reacting the arylsulfonylchloride with potassium fluoride in an inert organic solvent, such as 1,4-dioxane. The reaction is generally carried out under refluxing conditions for a period of about 1 to about 48 hours, typically about 24 hours. Generally, excess potassium fluoride<br>
25    is used in the reaction, which can be readily removed during a work-up process by washing with water. The resulting arylsulfonylfluoride is typically used without any further purification.<br>
III<br>
n<br>
Alternatively, Compounds of Formula I can also be prepared by reacting the deprotonated indole group with a disulfide reagent of the formula: R -S-S-R to produce 30    a thioether of the formula:<br><br><br>
where R\ R", R^\ and R" are those defined herein. Typically, the disulfide reagent is added to the deprotonated indole at the same temperature in which the base is added. The reaction mixture is then stirred at that temperature for few minutes to few hours, typically from about 1 to 2 hours, and is allowed to gradually warm to room temperature.<br>
The thioether compound of Formula III can be oxidized using an oxidizing agent to produce a corresponding sulfoxide and/or sulfone. Suitable oxidizing agents include meto-chloroperbenzoic acid (MCPBA), periodates, Oxone*, as well as other sulfur oxidizing agents known to one skilled in the art. For example, the thioether III can be reacted with MCPBA by combining the two reagents at about 0 Â°C in an inert solvent, such as dichloromethane, and stirring the mixture at room temperature for few hours. The excess MCPBA is typically removed by washing with an aqueous, preferably a basic aqueous, solution. Any undesired oxidation of nitrogen atom can be reduced by quenching the crude product with a phosphine compound, such as triphenylphosphine.<br>
When R^ or R^ group contains a protecting group, or when R^ is a protecting group, such protecting group can be removed after the synthesis using reaction conditions conventionally known to one sldlled in the art. See, for exarnple. Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 5^ edition, T.W. Greene and P.G.M. Wuts, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1999, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
More specific details for producing Compounds of Formula I are described in the Examples section.<br>
Surprisingly and unexpectedly, the present inventors have found that indole compounds having a substituent-S(0)nR^ on the 2-position have a wide range of pharmacological activities that are not present in the corresponding indoles that do not have a such substituent on the 2-position. For example, the compounds of the invention have selective 5-HT6 receptor affinity and are useful in the treatment of certain CNS disorders, such as Parkinson"s disease, Huntington"s disease, anxiety, depression, manic depression, psychosis, epilepsy, obsessive compulsive disorders, migraine, Alzheimer"s disease (enhancement of cognitive memory), sleep disorders, feeding disorders such as anorexia and bulimia, panic attacks, attention deficit hyperactivit)"- disorder (ADHD), attention deficit disorder (ADD), withdrawal from drug abuse such as cocaine, ethanol, nicotine and benzodiazepines, schizophrenia, and also disorders associated with spinal trauma and/or head injury such as hydrocephalus. In addition, compounds of the present invention are usefij in the treatment of certain GI (gastrointestinal) disorders, such functional bowel disorder.<br><br>
The pharmacology of the compounds of this invention was determined by art recognized procedures. The in vitro techniques for determining the affinities of test compounds at the 5-HT6 receptor in radioligand binding and functional assays are described in Examples 4-6.<br>
The present invention includes pharmaceutical compositions comprising at least one compound of the present invention, or an individual isomer, racemic or non-racemic mixture of isomers or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof, together with at least one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, and optionally other therapeutic and/or prophylactic ingredients.<br>
In general, the compounds of the present invention will be administered in a therapeutically effective amount by any of the accepted modes of administration for agents that serve similar utilities. Suitable dosage ranges are typically 1-500 mg daily, preferably 1-100 mg daily, and most preferably 1-30 mg daily, depending upon numerous factors such as the severity of the disease to be treated, the age and relative health of the subject, the potency of the compound used, the route and form of administration, the indication towards which the administration is directed, and the preferences and experience of the medical practitioner involved. One of ordinary skill in the art of treating such diseases will be able, without undue experimentation and in reliance upon personal knowledge and the disclosure of this Application, to ascertain a therapeutically effective amount of the compounds of the present invention for a given disease.<br>
In general, compounds of the present invention will be administered as pharmaceutical formulations including those suitable for oral (including buccal and subÂ¬lingual), rectal, nasal, topical, pulmonary, vaginal, or parenteral (including intramuscular, intraarterial, intrathecal, subcutaneous and intravenous) administration or in a form suitable for administration by inhalation or insufflation.

In powders, the carrier generally is a finely divided solid which is a mixture with the finely divided active component. In tablets, the active component generally is mixed with the carrier having the necessary binding capacity in suitable proportions and compacted in the shape and size desired. The powders and tablets preferably contain firom about one (1) to about seventy (70) percent of the active compound. Suitable carriers include but are not limited to magnesium carbonate, magnesium stearate, talc, sugar, lactose, pectin, dextrin, starch, gelatin, tragacanth, methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, a low melting wax, cocoa butter, and the like. The term "preparation" is intended to include the formulation of the active compound with encapsulating material as carrier, providing a capsule in which the active component, with or without carriers, is surrounded by a carrier, which is in association with it. Similarly, cachets and lozenges are included. Tablets, powders, capsules, pills, cachets, and lozenges maybe as solid forms suitable for oral administration.<br>
Other forms suitable for oral administration include liquid form preparations including emulsions, syrups, elixirs, aqueous solutions, aqueous suspensions, or solid form preparations which are intended to be converted shortly before use to liquid form preparations. Emulsions maybe prepared in solutions, for example, in aqueous propylene glycol solutions or may contain emulsifying agents, for example, such as lecithin, sorbitan monooleate, or acacia. Aqueous solutions can be prepared by dissolving the active component in water and adding suitable colorants, flavors, stabilizers, and thickening agents. Aqueous suspensions can be prepared by dispersing the finely divided active component in water with viscous material, such as natural or synthetic gums, resins, methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, and other well known<br><br>
suspending agents. Solid form preparations include solutions, suspensions, and emulsions, and may contain, in addition to the active component, colorants, flavors, stabilizers, buffers, artificial and natural sweeteners, dispersants, thickeners, solubilizing agents, and the like.<br>

The compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions, or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, for example solutions in aqueous polyethylene glycol. Examples of oily or nonaqueous carriers, diluents, solvents or vehicles include propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, vegetable oils (e.g., olive oil), and injectable organic esters (e.g., ethyl oleate), and may contain formulatory agents such as preserving, wetting, emulsifying or suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents. Alternatively, the active ingredient maybe in po\vder form, obtained by aseptic isolation of sterile solid or by lyophilization fi-om solution for constitution before use with a suitable vehicle, e.g., sterile, pyrogen-free water.<br>
The compounds of the present invention maybe formulated for topical administration to the epidermis as ointments, creams or lotions, or as a transdermal patch. Ointments and creams may, for example, be formulated with an aqueous or oily base with the addition of suitable thickening and/or gelling agents. Lotions may be formulated with an aqueous or oily base and will in general also containing one or more emulsifying agents, stabilizing agents, dispersing agents, suspending agents, thickening agents, or coloring agents. Formulations suitable for topical administration in the mouth include lozenges comprising active agents in a flavored base, usually sucrose and acacia o: tragacanth; pastilles comprising the active ingredient in an inert base such as gelatin and glycerin or sucrose and acacia; and mouthwashes comprising the active ingredient in a suitable liquid carrier.<br>
The compounds of the present invention maybe formulated for administration as suppositories. A low melting wax, such as a mixture of fatty acid glycerides or cocoa butter is first melted and the active component is dispersed homogeneously, for example by stirring. The molten homogeneous mixture is then poured into convenient sized molds, allowed to cool, and to solidify.<br>
The compounds of the present invention maybe formulated for vaginal administration. Pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or sprays containing in addition to the active ingredient such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate.<br><br>
The compounds of the present invention may be formulated for nasal administration. The solutions or suspensions are applied directly to the nasal cavity by conventional means, for example, with a dropper, pipette or spray. The formulations maybe provided in a single or multidose form. In the latter case of a dropper or pipette, this maybe achieved by the patient administering an appropriate, predetermined volume of the solution or suspension. In the case of a spray, this maybe achieved for example by means of a metering atomizing spray pump.<br>
The compounds of the present invention maybe formulated for aerosol administration, particularly to the respiratory tract and including intranasal administration. The compound will generally have a small particle size for example of the order of five (5) microns or less. Such a particle size may be obtained by means known in the art, for example by micronization. The active ingredient is provided in a pressurized packwith a suitable propeUant such as a chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), for example, dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, or dichlorotetrafluoroethane, or carbon dioxide or other suitable gas. The aerosol may conveniently also contain a surfactant such as lecithin. The dose of drug may be controlled by a metered valve. Alternatively the active ingredients may be provided in a form of a dry powder, for example a powder mix of the compound in a suitable powder base such as lactose, starch, starch derivatives such as hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose and polyvinylpyrrolidine (PVP). The powder carrier will form a gel in the nasal cavity. The powder composition maybe presented in unit dose form for example in capsules or cartridges of e.g., gelatin or blister packs from which the powder maybe administered by means of an inhaler.<br>
When desired, formulations can be prepared with enteric coatings adapted for sustained or controlled release administration of the active ingredient. For example, the compoimds of the present invention can be formulated in transdermal or subcutaneous drug delivery devices. These delivery systems are advantageous when sustained release of the compound is necessary and when patient compliance with a treatment regimen is crucial. Compounds in transdermal delivery systems are frequently attached to an skin-adhesive solid support. The compound of interest can also be combined with a penetration enhancer, e.g., Azone (l-dodecylazacycloheptan-2-one). Sustained release delivery systems are inserted subcutaneously into the subdermal layer by surgery or injection. The subdermal implants encapsulate the compound in a lipid soluble membrane, e.g., silicone rubber, or a biodegradable polymer, e.g., polylactic acid.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations are preferably in unit dosage forms. In such form, the preparation is subdivided into unit dosescontaining appropriate quantities of the active component. The unit dosage form can be a packaged preparation, the package containing discrete quantities of preparation, such as packeted tablets, capsules, and<br><br>
powders in vials or ampoules. Also, the unit dosage form can be a capsule, tablet, cachet, or lozenge itself, or it can be the appropriate number of any of these in packaged form.<br>
Other suitable pharmaceutical carriers and their formulations are described in Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy 1995, edited by E. W. Martin, Mack 5    Publishing Company, 19th edition, Easton, Pennsylvania. Representative pharmaceutical formulations containing a compound of the present invention are described in Examples 6-12.<br>

Example 5<br>
This example illustrates in vitro radioligand binding studies of Compound of Formula L<br>
The binding activity of compounds of this invention in vitro was determined as follows. Duplicate determinations of ligand affinity are made by competing for binding of [^H]LSD in cell membranes derived from HEK293 cells stably expressing recombinant human 5-HT6 receptor.<br>
All determinations were made in assay buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM MgS04, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 mM ascorbic acid, pH 7.4 at 37 Â°C, in a 250 microliter reaction volume. Assay tubes containing [^H] LSD (5 nM), competing ligand, and membrane were incubated in a shaking water bath for 60 min. at 37 Â°C, filtered onto Packard GF-B plates (pre-soaked with 0.3% PET) using a Packard 96 well cell harvester and washed 3<br><br>
times in ice cold 50 mM Tris-HCl. Bound ["HJ LSD was determmed as radioactive counts per minute using Packard TopCount.<br>
Displacement of [3H]LSD from the binding sites was quantified by fitting concentration-binding data to a 4-parameter logistic equation:<br><br>
binding = basal 4-<br><br>
Bmax-basal<br>
V1 +10 --^^"^^(logL/"gancfJ-log /C50<br><br>
where Hill is the Hill slope, [ligand] is the concentration of competing radioligand and rCso is the concentration of radioUgand producing half-maximal specific binding of radioligand. The specific binding window is the difference between the Bmax and the basal parameters.<br>
10	Using the procedures of Example 4, compounds of Formula I were tested and<br>
found to be selective 5-HT6 antagonists. Representative activities are shown in Table 2.<br>

Example 6<br>
15	The cognition-enhancing properties of compounds of the invention may b e in a<br>
model of animal cognition: the object recognition task model. Four months old male Wistar rats (Charles River, The Netherlands) were used. Compounds were prepared daily and dissolved in physiological saline and tested at three doses. Administration was always<br><br>
given i.p. (injection volume 1 mL/lcg) 60 minutes before Tl. Scopolamine hvdrobromide was injected 30 minutes after compound injection. Two equal testing groups were made of 24 rats and were tested by two experimenters. The testing order of doses was determined randomly. The experiments were performed using a double blind protocol. All rats were treated once with each dose condition. The object recognition test was performed as described by Ennaceur, A., Delacour, J., 1988, A new one-trial test for neurobiological studies of memory in rats. 1: Behavioral data. Behav. Brain Res. 31,47-59.<br>
