BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a broadband wireless access (BWA)<br>
communication system, and more particularly to a system and a method for<br>
performing a soft handover.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
In the 4 generation (4G) communication system, which is the next<br>
generation communication system, extensive research is being conducted to<br>
provide users with services having various Qualities-of-Service (QoSs) at high<br>
speeds. In the current 4G communication system, extensive research is being<br>
conducted to develop a new type of communication system ensuring the mobility<br>
of a mobile station (MS) and a QoS in a BWA communication system such as a<br>
wireless Local Area Network (LAN) system and a wireless Metropolitan Area<br>
Network (MAN) system capable of supporting relatively high transmission<br>
speeds. Representatives of such communication systems are the Institute of<br>
Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.16a communication system and<br>
the IEEE 802.16e communication system.<br>
The IEEE 802.16a/d-based communication system and the IEEE<br>
802.16e-based communication system use an orthogonal frequency division<br>
multiplexing (OFDM)/orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA)<br>
scheme for a physical channel of the WMAN system in order to support a<br>
broadband transmission network. The IEEE 802.16a communication system is a<br>
single structure system that does not reflect the mobility of a Subscriber Station<br>
(SS) at all, in which the SS is in a stationary state. In contrast, the IEEE<br>
802.16e-based communication system is a system realized by supplementing the<br>
IEEE 802.16a-based communication system with the ability to handle the<br>
mobility of an SS. Hereinafter, a mobile SS will be referred to as a MS.<br>
Accordingly, in the IEEE 802.16e-based communication system, the study of<br>
handover according to the mobility of the MS is being activated.<br>
Handover refers to an operation enabling smooth provision of services to<br>
an MS which is moving between base stations (BSs). Such handover may have<br>
two schemes (a hard handover scheme and a soft handover scheme). The hard<br>
handover scheme and the soft handover scheme will be described.<br><br>
The hard handover scheme denotes a scheme through which, when an<br>
MS moves between base stations, the MS releases a channel setup with an anchor<br>
base station (a serving base station currently providing a service to the MS) and<br>
sets up a channel with an active non-anchor base station (a target base station) in<br>
the shortest period of time, so that the service may be continuously provided.<br>
The serving base and the target base station will be referred to as an anchor base<br>
station and an active non-anchor base station, respectively, for the purpose of<br>
description. The hard handover causes a ping-pong phenomenon of<br>
continuously alternating channel release and setup when channel states are<br>
continuously inferior, for example, when the MS moves across a cell boundary<br>
region.<br>
The soft handover scheme denotes a scheme through which, when an MS<br>
moves between base stations, the MS has channels set up with both an anchor<br>
base station and an active non-anchor base station, is relocated in the non-anchor<br>
base station while simultaneously receiving signals from both the anchor base<br>
station and the non-anchor base station through the setup channel, and then<br>
releases the channel from the anchor base station, so that the service is<br>
continuously provided. Accordingly, when the MS performs a handover<br>
operation through the soft handover scheme, the MS receives downlink signals<br>
from a plurality of base stations (i.e. the anchor base station and the non-anchor<br>
base station) and improves quality of the received downlink signals by combining<br>
the downlink signals received from the base stations.<br>
The signal combining scheme may be classified into a soft combining<br>
scheme and a selection diversity scheme.<br>
The soft combining scheme is a scheme of demodulating each of the<br>
signals received from a plurality of base stations and combining the signals in a<br>
front end of a channel decoder. The selection diversity scheme is a scheme of<br>
de-modulating and channel-decoding each of the signals received from a plurality<br>
of base stations and then selecting a signal with the best quality from among the<br>
channel-decoded signals.<br>
The MS performing a handover operation through the soft handover<br>
scheme may obtain a soft combining gain by simultaneously receiving signals<br>
through channels set up with both the anchor base station and the non-anchor base<br>
station. In order to obtain the combining gain, the MS must receive information<br>
regarding channels (channel allocation information) set up with both the anchor<br>
base station and the non-anchor base station and receive signals from the anchor<br>
base station and the non-anchor base station using the channel allocation<br>
information.<br><br>
However, in the typical broadband wireless access system (e.g., the IEEE<br>
802.16e-based communication system), it is difficult for the MS to receive<br>
channel allocation information of an active non-anchor base station because an<br>
anchor base station reports only information regarding a channel allocated by the<br>
anchor base station.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the present invention has been made to solve at least the<br>
above-mentioned problems occurring in the prior art, and an object of the present<br>
invention is to provide a system and a method for performing a soft handover in a<br>
broadband wireless access communication system.<br>

allocation information of an active non-anchor base station in a broadband<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Hereinafter, a preferred embodiment of the present invention will be<br>
described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. Note that the<br>
same or similar components in drawings are designated by the same reference<br>
numerals as far as possible although they are shown in different drawings. In<br>
the following description of the present invention, a detailed description of known<br>
functions and configurations incorporated herein will be omitted when it may<br>
make the subject matter of the present invention rather unclear.<br>
The present invention proposes a system and a method for performing a<br>
soft handover in a broadband wireless access communication system (BWA) (e.g.,<br>
an Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.16e-based<br><br>
communication system). Particularly, the present invention proposes a system<br>
and a method in which an anchor base station (a serving base station) and an<br>
active non-anchor base station (a target base station) provide channel allocation<br>
information in order to perform a soft handover in the IEEE 802.16e-based<br>
communication system. Hereinafter, the serving base station and the target base<br>
station will be referred to as an anchor base station and an active non-anchor base<br>
station, respectively. According to the present invention, although the IEEE<br>
802.16e-based communication system is described by way of example for the<br>
purpose of description, it is natural that other communication systems as well as<br>
the IEEE 802.16e-based communication system can be employed.<br>
FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating a structure of an IEEE 802.de-<br>
based communication system according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
The IEEE 802.16e-based communication system having a multi-cell<br>
structure includes a cell 100, a cell 150, a base station 110 controlling the cell 100,<br>
a base station 140 controlling the cell 150, and a plurality of MSs 111, 113, 130,<br>
151, and 153. Although one base station may control several cells, it is assumed<br>
that one base station controls only one cell for the purpose of description in the<br>
embodiment of the present invention. In addition, the base stations 110 and 140<br>
transmit/receive signals to/from the MSs 111, 113, 130, 151, and 153 using the<br>
OFDM/OFDMA scheme. Herein, it is assumed that the base stations 110 and<br>
140 have a multi-sector structure, sectors in the same cell use the same center-<br>
frequency, and adjacent sectors are assigned different sub-channels.<br>
The above description deals with the structure of the IEEE 802.16e-based<br>
communication system according to an embodiment of the present invention with<br>
reference to FIG. 1, and, hereinafter, a sector structure in the IEEE 802.16e-based<br>
communication system according to an embodiment of the present invention will<br>
be described with reference to FIG. 2.<br>
FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating the sector structure in the IEEE<br>
802.16e-based communication system according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
A cell controlled by a base station is divided into several sectors (e.g., three<br>
sectors; a first sector 210, a second sector 220, and a third sector 230). Each of<br>
the first sector 210 to the third sector 230 employs the same center-frequency of<br>
F1, and different sub-channels are used between them. In other words, the first<br>
sector 210 to the third sector 230 use mutually-different sub-channel sets as<br>
shown in FIG. 2. The first sector 210, the second sector 220, and the third sector<br>
230 use the first sub-channel set, the second sub-channel set, and the third sub-<br><br>
channel set, respectively.<br>
The above description deals with the sector structure in the IEEE<br>
802.16e-based communication system according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention with reference to FIG. 2, and, hereinafter, a frame structure in the IEEE<br>
802.16e-based communication system according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention will be described with reference to FIG. 3.<br>
FIG. 3 is a block diagram illustrating the frame structure in the IEEE<br>
802.16e-based communication system according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
The frame structure in the IEEE 802.16e-based communication system<br>
includes a downlink (DL) frame 310 and an uplink (UL) frame 320. The DL<br>
frame 310 includes a preamble field 312, a DL-MAP/UL-MAP field 314, a PUSC<br>
(partial usage of sub-channels) field 316, and an FUSC (full usage of sub-<br>
channels) field 318. The UL frame 320 includes a PUSC field 322.<br>
The preamble field 312 is a field used for transmitting a preamble<br>
sequence for synchronization between a base station and an MS. The DL-<br>
MAP/UL-MAP field 314 is a field used for transmitting a DL-MAP message and<br>
an UL-MAP message. The base station transmits the MAP message indicating a<br>
channel interval allocated to each MS before the channel interval, and the MS<br>
detects information included in the MAP message so as to recognize the channel<br>
interval and a coding scheme. Detailed descriptions of the DL-MAP message<br>
and the UL-MAP message will be given later. The PUSC field 316 is a field<br>
used for transmitting DL data burst through a PUSC scheme, and the FUSC field<br>
318 is a field used for transmitting DL data burst through an FUSC scheme. In<br>
addition, the PUSC field 322 is a field used for transmitting UL data burst using a<br>
PUSC scheme. .<br>
FIG. 4 illustrates the format of the DL-MAP message according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The DL-MAP message includes various information elements (IEs), i.e.,<br>
'Management Message Type' representing a type of a transmitted message,<br>
'Physical (PHY) Synchronization' set corresponding to a modulation scheme or a<br>
de-modulation scheme applied to a physical channel in order to acquire<br>
synchronization, 'DCD count' representing a count value corresponding to the<br>
configuration change of a downlink channel descriptor message including<br>
downlink burst profile, 'Base Station ID' representing a base station identifier,<br>
and n number of DL-MAP IEs. The DL-MAP message includes information of<br>
raging codes assigned for raging.<br>
FIG. 5 illustrates the form of the UL-MAP message according to an<br><br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The UL-MAP message includes various IEs, i.e., 'Management Message<br>
Type' representing a type of a transmitted message, 'Uplink Channel ID'<br>
representing a used uplink channel identifier, 'UCD count' representing a count<br>
value corresponding to the configuration change of an uplink channel descript<br>
message including uplink burst profile, 'Allocation Start Time' representing<br>
information regarding start time to allocate uplink resources, and n number of<br>
UL-MAP IEs. The Uplink Channel ID is assigned as a unique value in a<br>
Medium Access Control (MAC)-sub layer.<br>
A data burst field of the DL-frame 310 shown in FIG. 3 includes time<br>
slots assigned according to MSs through a Time Division Multiplexing<br>
(TDM)/Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) scheme. A base station<br>
broadcasts control information to MSs (receiving services from the base station)<br>
through the DL-MAP/UP-MAP field 314 by using a preset center-frequency.<br>
As each of the MSs is powered on, each MS detects a reference signal<br>
having the maximum size (e.g., the maximum Carrier to Interference and Noise<br>
Ratio (CINR)) by monitoring all of the frequency bands preset in each MS.<br>
Herein, the reference signal may include a pilot signal. Each MS determines a<br>
base station having transmitted the reference signal having the highest CINR as a<br>
base station controlling the MS, analyzes a DL-MAP message and an UL-MAP<br>
message in the DL-MAP/UL-MAP field 314 of the DL frame 310 transmitted<br>
from the base station so as to determine channel allocation information indicating<br>
the interval at which real data burst and control information controlling the DL<br>
and the UL of the MS are transmitted/received, and transmits/receives data burst<br>
at the corresponding data burst transmit/receive interval.<br>
An IEEE 802.16e communication system in which one base station uses<br>
one center frequency and a plurality of sectors within the base station use as many<br>
sub-bands as the sectors divided from a frequency band corresponding to the<br>
center frequency will now be described. In such an IEEE 802.16e<br>
communication system, when an MS moves from a current anchor base station to<br>
another base station (an active non-anchor base station), or the MS moves from<br>
an anchor sector (a serving sector) to another sector (an active non-anchor sector;<br>
a target sector) within the same anchor base station, the MS must perform a<br>
handover. In particular, according to an embodiment of the present invention,<br>
the MS must perform a soft handover.In order to perform the soft handover<br>
described above, an MS must obtain channel allocation information of both an<br>
anchor base station (an anchor sector in the case of handover between sectors)<br>
and an active non-anchor base station (an active non-anchor sector in the case of<br><br>
handover between sectors). Herein, the channel allocation information is<br>
included in MAP messages transmitted to the MS (requesting soft handover) from<br>
the anchor base station or the non-anchor base station. In other words, all of the<br>
base stations of the IEEE 802.16e communication system broadcast channel<br>
allocation information of their neighboring base stations through the MAP<br>
messages.<br>
In the conventional IEEE 802.16e communication system, an anchor base<br>
station inserts the MAP IEs (including channel allocation information for data<br>
burst to be transmitted/received to/from an MS) into a MAP message to be<br>
transmitted, and the MS transmits/receives data burst through a UL/DL<br>
corresponding to the channel allocation information included in the MAP IEs.<br>
However, according to an embodiment of the present invention, the MS must<br>
receive channel allocation information from the anchor base station and the non-<br>
anchor base station so that the MS may simultaneously transmit/receive the same<br>
data burst from both the anchor base station and the non-anchor base station in an<br>
MS handover area. In particular, according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention, it is possible to obtain a soft combining gain by decoding and buffering<br>
data burst from the anchor base station and the non-anchor base station having the<br>
same data burst without taking into consideration a soft combining scheme<br>
employing the same permulation, the same symbol, and the same sub-channel in a<br>
physical layer.<br>
Hereinafter, further description about the MAP IEs for the soft handover<br>
newly proposed in the present invention will be given.<br>
In the conventional IEEE 802.16e communication system, it is impossible<br>
for an MS to simultaneously receive the MAP IEs from two or more base stations.<br>
Accordingly, in an IEEE 802.16e communication system according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention, an anchor base station and an active non-<br>
anchor base station insert the MAP IEs including channel allocation information<br>
of both the anchor base station and the non-anchor base station for the MS into<br>
their own MAP messages. Then, the MS receives the MAP IEs from one of the<br>
anchor base station and the non-anchor base station, obtains channel information<br>
regarding both the anchor base station and the non-anchor base station from the<br>
MAP IEs, and transmits/receives data burst from/to the anchor base station and<br>
the non-anchor base station corresponding to the obtained channel information.<br>
Hereinafter, a detailed description about the MAP IEs proposed in the present<br>
invention will be given.(l) A Handover Anchor Active MAP IE ('HO Anchor<br>
Active MAP IE').<br>
The HO Anchor Active MAP IE is a MAP IE transmitted from an active<br><br>
non-anchor base station that includes channel allocation information of a DL or a<br>
UL of an anchor base station and indicates that there is data burst transmitted<br>
from an anchor base station. The HO Anchor Active MAP IE including the<br>
channel assignment information of the DL of the anchor base station corresponds<br>
to a HO Anchor Active DL MAP IE, and the HO Anchor Active MAP IE<br>
including the channel assignment information of the UL of the anchor base station<br>
corresponds to a HO Anchor Active UL MAP IE.(2) A Handover MAP IE in a<br>
non-anchor base station ('HO MAP IE in non-anchor BS').<br>
The HO MAP IE in non-anchor BS is a MAP IE transmitted from an<br>
anchor base station that includes the channel allocation information of a DL or a<br>
UL of an active non-anchor base station and indicates that there is data burst<br>
transmitted from the non-anchor base station. The HO MAP IE in non-anchor<br>
BS including the channel assignment information of the DL of the non-anchor<br>
base station corresponds to 'HO DL MAP IE in non-anchor BS', and the HO<br>
MAP IE in non-anchor BS including the channel assignment information of the<br>
UL of the non-anchor base station corresponds to 'HO UL MAP IE in non-anchor<br>
BS'.<br>
(3) A Handover Connection Identifier Translation MAP IE ('HO CID<br>
Translation MAP IE')<br>
The HO CID Translation MAP IE is a MAP IE transmitted from an<br>
active non-anchor base station and is transmitted in order to map a CID of a MS<br>
allocated by an anchor base station with a CID of the MS allocated by an active<br>
non-anchor base station. In addition, the HO CID Translation MAP IE<br>
represents that there is data burst transmitted from the non-anchor base station.<br>
FIG. 6 illustrates the format of the HO Anchor Active DL MAP IE<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The HO Anchor Active DL MAP IE includes 'Extended DIUC<br>
(Downlink Interval Usage Code) field used for distinguishing a plurality of IEs<br>
(i.e., the HO Anchor Active DL MAP IE), 'Length' indicating the length of the<br>
HO Anchor Active DL MAP IE, and IEs for each data burst. As shown in FIG. 6,<br>
the IEs for each data burst include 'Anchor Preamble' representing a preamble of<br>
the anchor base station, 'Anchor CID' representing a basic CID assigned to a<br>
corresponding MS in the anchor base station, 'DIUC, 'OFDMA Symbol offset'<br>
indicating a starting point of a symbol representing assigned data burst,<br>
'Subchannel offset' indicating a starting point of a sub-channel representing<br>
assigned data burst, 'Boosting' representing if transmission power of a sub-carrier<br>
for the assigned data burst is boosted, 'No. OFDMA Symbol' representing the<br>
number of symbols of the assigned data burst, 'No.Subchannels' representing the<br><br>
number of sub-channels of the assigned data burst, and 'Repetition Coding<br>
Indication' representing a repetition code used for the assigned data burst.<br>
FIG. 7 illustrates the format of the HO DL MAP IE in non-anchor BS<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The HO DL MAP IE in non-anchor BS includes 'Extended DIUC<br>
(Downlink Interval Usage Code)' used for distinguishing a plurality of the IEs<br>
(i.e., the HO DL MAP IE in non-anchor BS), 'Length' indicating the length of the<br>
HO DL MAP IE in non-anchor BS, and IEs for each data burst. As shown in<br>
FIG. 7, the IEs for each data burst include 'Non-Anchor Preamble' representing a<br>
preamble of the active non-anchor base station, 'Anchor CID' representing a basic<br>
CID assigned to a corresponding MS in the anchor base station, 'DIUC,<br>
'OFDMA Symbol offset' indicating a starting point of a symbol representing<br>
assigned data burst, 'Subchannel offset' indicating a starting point of a sub-<br>
channel used for the assigned data burst, 'Boosting' representing if transmission<br>
power of a sub-carrier for the assigned data burst is boosted, 'No. OFDMA<br>
Symbol' representing the number of symbols of the assigned data burst,<br>
'No.Subchannels' representing the number of sub-channels of the assigned data<br>
burst, and 'Repetition Coding Indication' representing a repetition code used for<br>
the assigned data burst.<br>
FIG. 8 illustrates a format of the HO CID Translation MAP IE according<br>
to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The HO CID Translation MAP IE includes 'Extended DIUC (Downlink<br>
Interval Usage Code)' used for distinguishing a plurality of the IEs (i.e., the HO<br>
CID Translation MAP IE), 'Length' indicating the length of the HO CID<br>
Translation MAP IE, and IEs for each data burst. As shown in FIG. 8, the IEs<br>
for each data burst include 'Anchor Preamble' representing a preamble of the<br>
anchor base station, 'Anchor CID' representing a basic CID assigned to a<br>
corresponding MS in the anchor base station, and 'Non-Anchor CID' representing<br>
a basic CID temporally used to represent the channel assignment information for<br>
the data burst to be transmitted to a corresponding MS in a DL or a UL of the<br>
active non-anchor base station.<br>
In other words, in an active non-anchor base station, an MS that is<br>
performing a soft handover confirms the HO CID Translation MAP IE,<br>
recognizes the preamble of an anchor base station and 'Non-Anchor CID' mapped<br>
with 'Anchor CID', and receives data burst transmitted from the active non-<br>
anchor base station using the Non-anchor CID assigned to the MS. It is<br>
necessary to insert the Anchor Preamble into the HO CID Translation MAP IE<br>
because the MSs performing soft handover in the active non-anchor base station<br><br>
may have different anchor base stations. In addition, the anchor base stations<br>
may have the same Anchor CIDs. In this case, the Anchor Preamble may be<br>
used to distinguish the MSs connected to different anchor base stations. In<br>
addition, the MS performing a soft handover must decode the HO CID<br>
Translation MAP IE in every frame in order to transmit/receive data burst to/from<br>
the active non-anchor base station because the Non-Anchor CID of the active<br>
non-anchor base station may be changed in every frame.<br>
FIG. 9 illustrates the format of the HO Anchor Active UL MAP IE<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention.The HO Anchor Active UL<br>
MAP IE includes 'Extended UIUC (Uplink Interval Usage Code)' used for<br>
distinguishing a plurality of the IEs (i.e., the HO Anchor Active UL MAP IE),<br>
'Length' indicating the length of the HO Anchor Active UL MAP IE, and IEs for<br>
each data burst. As shown in FIG. 9, the IEs for each data burst include 'Anchor<br>
Preamble' representing a preamble of the anchor base station, 'Anchor CID'<br>
representing a basic CID assigned to a corresponding MS in the anchor base<br>
station, 'UIUC representing an uplink interval usage code, 'Start Subchannel<br>
offset' indicating a starting point of a sub-channel representing assigned data burst,<br>
'Duration' indicating the amount of resource in OFDMA slot, and 'Repetition<br>
Coding Indication' representing a repetition code used for the assigned data burst.<br>
FIG. 10 illustrates the format of the HO UL MAP IE in non-anchor BS<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The HO UL MAP IE in non-anchor BS includes 'Extended UIUC used<br>
for distinguishing a plurality of the IEs (i.e., the HO UL MAP IE in non-anchor<br>
BS), 'Length' indicating the length of the HO UL MAP IE in non-anchor BS, and<br>
IEs for each data burst. As shown in FIG. 10, the IEs for each data burst include<br>
'Non-Anchor Preamble' representing a preamble of the active non-anchor base<br>
station, 'Anchor CID' representing a basic CID assigned to a corresponding MS<br>
in the anchor base station, 'UIUC, 'Start Subchannel offset' indicating a starting<br>
point of a sub-channel representing the assigned data burst, 'Duration' indicating<br>
the amount of resource in OFDMA, and 'Repetition Coding Indication'<br>
representing a repetition code used for the assigned data burst.<br>
FIG. 11 is a flowchart illustrating the operation of the MS performing a<br>
soft handover by receiving channel assignment information from an anchor base<br>
station according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The MS detects a preamble sequence from the anchor base station so as<br>
to obtain synchronization with the anchor base station in step 1111. In step 1113,<br>
the MS determines if it necessary to perform a soft handover between an anchor<br>
base station and another base station (i.e. an active non-anchor base station). If<br><br>
it is not necessary for the MS to perform the soft handover, the MS performs step<br>
1115, wherein the MS demodulates and decodes typical MAP messages (MAP<br>
messages used for the conventional IEEE 802.16e communication system) so as<br>
to detect DL-MAP IEs and UL-MAP IEs. In step 1117, the MS<br>
transmits/receives data burst corresponding to the DL-MAP IE and the UL-MAP<br>
IE detected from the anchor base station and then terminates the operation of<br>
performing the soft handover.<br>
If the MS must perform a soft handover as the determination result in step<br>
1113, the MS performs step 1119, wherein the MS demodulates and decodes<br>
MAP messages so as to detect the DL-MAP IE, the UL-MAP IE, the HO DL<br>
MAP IE in non-anchor BS, and the HO UL MAP IE in non-anchor BS because<br>
the MS must perform the soft handover. In step 1121, the MS detects the Non-<br>
Anchor Preamble and the Anchor CID included in the detected HO DL MAP in<br>
non-anchor BS and the detected HO UL MAP IE in non-anchor BS. It is<br>
necessary to detect the Non-Anchor preamble and the Anchor CID so that the MS<br>
may distinguish data burst transmitted/received from/to the active non-anchor<br>
base station as described above.<br>
In step 1123, the MS transmits/receives data burst from/to the anchor<br>
base station and the active non-anchor base station correspondingly to the<br>
detected DL-MAP IE, the UL-MAP IE, the HO DL MAP IE in non-anchor BS,<br>
and the HO UL MAP in non-anchor BS and then terminates the operation of<br>
performing the soft handover.<br>
FIG. 12 is a flowchart illustrating the operation of an MS performing soft<br>
handover by receiving channel assignment information from an active non-anchor<br>
base station according to one embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The MS detects a preamble sequence from the active non-anchor base<br>
station so as to obtain synchronization with the active non-anchor base station in<br>
step 1211. The MS determines if a soft handover operation is currently<br>
performed in step 1213. If the soft handover operation is being performed, the<br>
MS demodulates and decodes MAP messages so as to detect the HO CID<br>
Translation MAP IE, the DL-MAP IE, the UL-MAP IE, the HO Anchor Active<br>
DL MAP IE, and the HO Anchor Active UL MAP IE in step 1215. In step 1217,<br>
the MS detects 'Anchor Preamble' and 'Anchor CID' included in the HO Anchor<br>
Active DL MAP IE and the HO Anchor Active UL MAP IE. It is necessary to<br>
detect the Anchor preamble and the Anchor CID so that the MS may distinguish<br>
data burst transmitted/received from/to the anchor base station as described above.<br>
However, if the active non-anchor base station uses a CID identical to the Anchor<br>
CID used in the anchor base station, it is impossible for the MS to<br><br>
transmit/receive data burst from/to the anchor base station because CIDs are<br>
intrinsically assigned according to base stations.<br>
Accordingly, in step 1219, the MS detects the Non-Anchor CID based on<br>
the detected HO CID Translation MAP IE. As a result, the MS detects the Non-<br>
Anchor CID from the anchor base station, so that the MS can transmit/receive<br>
data burst having Anchor CID corresponding to the Non-Anchor CID. In step<br>
1221, the MS transmits/receives data burst from/to both the anchor base station<br>
and the active non-anchor base station correspondingly to the detected HO CID<br>
Translation MAP IE, the DL-MAP IE, the UL-MAP IE, the HO Anchor Active<br>
DL MAP IE, and the HO Anchor Active UL MAP IE, and then terminates the<br>
operation of performing soft handover.<br>
As described above, according to the present invention, new MAP IEs are<br>
embodied in the IEEE 802.16e-based communication system, thereby enabling<br>
soft handover of the MS. As a result, the soft handover of the MS improves<br>
signal receiving quality of the MS and removes the ping-pong phenomenon<br>
caused in had handover, thereby improving the performance of an entire system.<br>
While the invention has been shown and described with reference to<br>
certain preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in<br>
the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without<br>
departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Consequently, the scope of<br>
the invention should not be limited to the embodiments,but should be defined by<br>
