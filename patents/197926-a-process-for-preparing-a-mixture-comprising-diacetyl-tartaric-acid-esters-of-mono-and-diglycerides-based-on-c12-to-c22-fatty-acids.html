Diacetvl    tartaric    acid    esters    of    mono-    and    diglycerides based on  C12   to  C22   fatty acids<br>
The invention relates to a mixture comprising diacetyl tartaric acid esters of mono- and<br>
diglycerides based on C12 to C22 fatty acids. Diacetyl tartaric acid esters of mono- and<br>
diglycerides based on C12 to C22 fatty acids are generally known as baking ingredients<br>
for baked products more in particular for yeast-leavened products such as bread (especially<br>
white bread), tin bread, rolls, hard rolls, German crispy rolls, buns, rusks etc. These esters<br>
are able to improve the products in various respects as good leavening expressed as<br>
specific volume, even pores and acceptable crustiness. Also they are known to improve<br>
the properties of dough such as its stability and rheology and are therefore often referred to<br>
as dough conditioners. The esters are further used in baking aids and in improved flour.<br>
The EC number of mixtures of diacetyl tartaric acid esters of mono- and diglycerides<br>
based on CI2 to C22 fatty acids is E 472e (DATEM).<br>
The art has long described mixtures comprising diacetyl tartaric acid esters of mono- and<br>
diglycerides based on C12 to C22 fatty acids and their preparation e.g.<br>
US-A-2 236 516 (Frank J. Cahn et al) is an early patent specification disclosing products<br>
obtained by reacting diacetyl tartaric acid with glyceryl monostearate.<br>
US-A-2 689 797 (Morris H. Joffe) discloses improvements in bread obtained by the<br>
incorporation of diacetyltartaric esters of unsaturated and partially saturated mono and/or<br>
partial glycerides.<br>
US-A-2 938 027 (Martell M. Gladstone) discloses the reaction between mixtures of<br>
acetylated anhydrides of food acids such as e.g. tartaric acid containing 4 to about 95% of<br>
diacetylated tartaric acid and e.g. free acetic anhydride with partial glycerides of fatty<br>
acids to obtain improved products.<br>
US-A-3 443 969 (Nobuo Nakejima et al) discloses diacetyltartaric esters of purified<br>
(molecular distilled) monoglycerides of vegetable oils.<br>
GB-A-1  220 488 (Aktieselskabet Grindstedvaerket) discloses the preparation of an<br>
emulsifier obtained by reacting e.g. distilled glycerol monostearate with diacetyl tartaric<br>
anhydride in certain molar ratios followed by prolonged heating to 135-190°C as to obtain<br>
by polymerisation a satisfactory oil-in-water emulsifier of higher molecular weight, which<br><br>
apparently contains polymeric esters due to splitting off acetic acid and water. GB-A-1 344 518 (Dynamit Nobel A.G.) discloses solid acetyltartaric esters obtained by reacting at least partially acetylated tartaric acid with partial glycerides containing 55-65% monoglyceride and an iodine value below 5 which contain per mole of partial glyceride 0.91-1.8 mole tartaric acid residues and 1.8-3.4 mole acetic acid residues. These esters free flowing powders whereas the traditional esters have a waxy or honey-like consistency. This difference in physical properties is due to the fact that these powders contain appreciable quantities of say about 0.3 mol % of glyceride esters of monoacetyl tartaric residues and/or even non-acetylated tartaric acid residues. Conventional acetylated tartaric acid esters of mono- and/or diglycerides are mono- and/or diglyceride esters of (almost) pure diacetylated tartaric acid (anhydride). The products according to the present invention are also very low in esters of monoacetylated tartaric acid (anhydride).<br>
Although the current diacetyl tartaric acid esters of mono- and diglycerides based of CI2 to C22 fatty acids are valuable products they are often somewhat defective as to:<br>
1.	specific volume of the baked product obtained;<br>
2.	stability as to leavening under the influence of yeast;<br>
3.	stability properties of the dough prepared.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a mixture comprising diacetyl tartaric acid esters of mono- and diglycerides based on C12 to C22 fatty acids yielding a performance which is improved in at least one of the properties mentioned above. Moreover the present invention also provides a process for the preparation of the mixtures of the diacetyl tartaric acid esters of mono- and diglycerides based on C12 to C22 fatty acids according to the present invention by reaction of diacetylated tartaric acid anhydride and mono- and diglycerides C12 to C22 fatty acids at a relatively low temperature combined with a short time of reaction which is more economic than most of the current processes.<br>
The invention therefore provides in a first embodiment a mixture comprising diacetyl tartaric acid esters on mono- and diglycerides based on C12 to C22 fatty acids which mixture comprises diacetyl tartaric acid glycerol monoesters containing: (A) one fatty acid<br><br>
group, one diacetylated tartaric acid monoester group and a free hydroxyl group and (B) one fatty acid group and two diacetylated tartaric acid monoester groups in which<br>
1.	the concentration of (A) above in the total mixture obtained by dividing the molar amount of (A) by the sum of the molar amounts of all components in the mixture and multiplying by 100 is at least 45%, preferably at least 50% and that<br>
2.	the fraction obtained by dividing the molar amount of (A) above by the combined molar amounts of (A) and (B) taken together is at least 0.70, preferably at least 0.72 and in which the molar amounts are determined by the NMR method herein described.<br>
These NMR measurements were performed at 50°C in CDCI3 on a Jeol JNMR EX400 FT-NMR spectrometer operating at 400 MHz for 'H. Typically, 20 mg of sample was dissolved in 0.5 ml of solvent. To prevent overlap of the H2O resonance with resonances of the product the pH of the sample was lowered to approximately 4 by adding acetic acid. The pulse delay (PD) time had to be chosen such that ftiU relaxation of the signals takes place (PD&gt;5T,).<br><br><br>
N.B. All these integral values have to be corrected for glycerol mono-, di- and triesters of C14toC18fatty acids, if any, first.<br>
Or in words the formulae represent	'<br>
' (A) equals a fraction of which the numerator is 100 times (P minus the sum of 4 times Q plus twice R plus 4 times S) divided by 5 and the denominator is (the sum of P' plus Q plus R plus S in which P' is P minus the sum of 4 times Q plus twice R plus four times S) divided by 5 and in which<br>
(B) equals a fraction of which the numerator is S multiplied by 100 and the denominator is (the sum of P' plus Q plus R plus S in which P' is P minus the sum of 4 times Q plus twice R plus four times S ) divided by 5.<br>
In case a product is at stake which contains fatty acid triglyceride as an extender as may be the case the NMR data measured need to be corrected for this percentage of triglyceride. Therefore the amount of triglyceride , if present, has to be determined and the method disclosed by P. Quinlan and H. J. Weiser Jr in JAOCS 35, 325-6 (1958) was found suitable. We used a modified method employing toluene (technical grade) instead of benzene and silicagel 60, no 1.07734.110 ex Merck, 20-230 mesh which activated with 9 wt% of water instead of 5% of water. The NMR signals of the specific fatty acid triglycerides which are needed are known from Sadtler Index of IH-NMR spectra [Sadtler Research Laboratories (Biorad) Philadelphia, PA, USA].<br>
In case a product is at stake in which mono- and/or diglycerides are used as an extender the analysis of the percentage diglycerides was carried out by proton NMR applying the same method as used for the determination of A and B above. 1-2 diglycerides were measured at 5 == 4.30 ppm. 1-3 diglycerides at 5 = 4.05 to 4.25 ppm. Both components were calculated with formula:<br><br><br>
of 40:60 wt%. From literature (JAOCS 37; August1960 and JAOCS 23, 3 90 (I960)) a general ratio from 35:65 to 49:51 depending on the chainlength (C12-C18) and temperature (20-200°C) of the fatty acids is known. Since in most commercial emulsifiers the majority of fatty acids used are of C16 and C18 chain length, a 1-2, 1-3 diglycerides ratio of 2:3 was been applied.<br>
In case diglycerides were present as indicated at 5 = 4.3 0 ppm, the integral P has to be corrected by subtracting two and a half times the integral value of 1-2 diglycerides at 8 = 4.30 ppm.<br>
The integral value for triglycerides has been calculated according to:<br>
^Tri        (l-CyMrri+G-MB<br>
In which G is the weight fraction triglycerides determined using the modified method of Quinlan and Weiser in JAOCS 1958 cited above, M^, Mg and Rrri the average molecular masses of components A, B and triglycerides respectively and IA and Ig the integral values obtained by NMR for components A and B including triglycerides.<br>
Mono-diglycerides of C12-C22 fatty acids which can be used in the preparation of the mixtures of diacetyl tartaric acid esters of mono- and diglycerides based on CI2 to C22 fatty acids according to the present invention are obtainable from triglycerides of these fatty acids which can be of both vegetable and animal origin. E.g. from soya bean oil, coconut oil, babussa oil, palm oil, sunflower oil, lard, tallow and fish oil, optionally hydrogenated or fractionated. Mixtures of mainly palmitic and stearic acid are preferred. The mono-diglycerides can be prepared by interesterification with glycerol, usually in the presence of an alkaline catalyst. Mostly the triglyceride oil and the glycerol reacted are free from water or moisture. Further details of this reaction are e.g. disclosed in US-A-2 875 221 (Bimbaum). Esterification leads to mixtures of mono- and diglycerides. After removal of water and unreacted glycerol the product obtained contained up to 65 wt % of monoglycerides. More pure monoglycerides can be obtained by molecular distilling the<br><br>
monoglycerides from the mixture and results m monogiycendes contammg at least 90% monoglycerides. Such distilled products are e.g. marketed under the tradename Hymono ex Quest, Naarden, Netherlands. Crystallisation and other fractionation processes might also yield similar relatively pure products. The term distilled monoglycerides therefore here has a wider interpretation than the literal sense and covers also purified monoglycerides obtained by other means than distillation. Monoglycerides containing 60 to 80% monoglycerides are usually prepared by diluting distilled monoglycerides with imdistilled mono-diglycerides. They are marketed as such and in admixture with triglyceride fat. Monoglycerides containing from 60, preferably 70, to 99, more preferably 80 to 99 wt % of monoglyceride can be used for preparing the present mixtures. In the practice of the present invention it is preferred to use distilled products especially those obtained by molecular or short path distillation.<br>
Diacetylated tartaric acid anhydride and derivatives are usually prepared from tartaric acid (dextro, levo, racemic or meso), preferably from natural = L-(+) tartaric acid or racemic tartaric acid and excess acetic anhydride by heating in the presence of suitable catalyst like sulphuric acid and distilling of acetic acid. The diacetylated tartaric acid (anhydride) used in the practice of the present invention is substantially diacetylated material and contains less than 2.5 mol %, preferably less than 1 mol %, more preferably less than 0.5 mol % of monoacetylated material. Further details e.g. disclosed in US-A-2 520 139 (Fuchs) and WO 96/35658 (Quest International) especially for D- and DL-tartaric acid as starting materials. It is normal practice to use food grade or P.A. grade materials in the preparation. In another embodiment of the invention the novel mixture of diacetylated tartaric acid esters of mono- and/or diglycerides described above is diluted with a suitable edible and/or food grade extender (e.g. fatty acid triglyceride or mono- and/or diglyceride of fatty acid(s) or another emulsifying agent) to any cost-effective level at which improved baking properties are still noticeable. Usually the amount of extender ranges between 10 and 50, preferably 20 and 40 wt % in the diluted product.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the invention provides a mixture, in which the concentration of (A) above in the mixture, obtained by dividing the molar amount of (A) by the sum of the molar amounts of all components in the mixture and multiplying by 100 is at least 55%,<br><br>
preferably at least 60% (or e.g. at least 65%).<br>
In another preferred embodiment the invention provides a mixture as specified above in which the fraction obtained by dividing the molar amount of (A) above by the combined molar amounts of (A) and (B) taken together is at least 0.75, preferably at least 0.85 (or e.g. at least 0.90).<br>
In another preferred embodiment the invention provides a mixture as specified above in which the reaction mixture is based on distilled monoglycerides and contains less than 5, preferably less than 4 wt % of diacetyl tartaric esters of fatty acid diglycerides. In another preferred embodiment the invention provides a mixture as specified above in which the mixture is based on mono- and diglycerides of substantially fully saturated CI 6 and/or CI8 fatty acids.<br>
In another embodiment the invention provides a process for preparing a novel mixture comprising diacetyl tartaric acid esters of mono- and diglycerides based on C12 to C22 fatty acids as described above in which diacetylated tartaric acid anhydride is molten and reacted at 135-175°C with molten CI2 to C22 fatty acid partial glycerides comprising 60-99, preferably 70 to 99 wt %, of monoglycerides, preferably in an inert atmosphere, for a reaction period of from 0.5 to 30, preferably from 1 to 15 minutes, more preferably from 2 to 10 minutes in the presence of an effective amount of a catalyst. Suitable catalysts are e.g. alkaline compounds like sodium, potassium, magnesium or calcium carboxylates such as their stearates, palmitates and other carboxylic acid salts e.g. in amounts from 0.05 to 0.5 wt percent calculated on the reaction mixture.<br>
In another embodiment the invention provides a process for preparing tmfmmmmi^ PMpMMig a novel mixture comprising diacetyl tartaric acid esters of mono- and diglycerides based on C12 to C22 fatty acids, more preferably based on saturated C16 to CI8 fatty acids as described above, in which the mono- diglycerides containing 60 to 99, preferably 70 to 99 wt % of monoglycerides are molten and solid diacetylated tartaric acid anhydride is dissolved therein and reacted in the liquid phase, preferably in an inert atmos¬phere, with the mono-diglycerides at a temperature between 60 and 120°C for a period of 5 to 30 minutes in the presence of an effective amount of an alkaline catalyst. This reaction usually takes place frjlly in the liquid phase. The preparation of mixtures of diacetyl tartaric acid esters of mono- and diglycerides<br><br>
based on CI2 to C22 fatty acids according to the present invention can be carried out batchwise (e.g. in a stirred tank reactor), semi-continuously (e.g. in two or more stirred tank reactors operating in turn in the sequence filling, reacting and discharging) or continuously (e.g. in a (multi)-tube reactor or in a cascade of stirred tank reactors). Another possibility is to carry out the reaction in a microwave [stirred tank(s) or tube] reactor. The reaction itself is exothermic so that the (reaction) temperature may rise so rapidly that the product deteriorates whereas at too low a reaction temperature diacetyl tartaric acid anhydride may solidify. Consequently the equipment, especially for continuous processing, needs to be equipped with suitable means for a tight temperature control comprising an advanced cooling system. Therefore equipment suggested for the continuous preparation of monoglycerides is unsuitable for the preparation of the mixture of diacetyl esters of mono- and/or diglycerides according to the present invention. In another embodiment the invention provides a process as specified above in which the reaction between diacetylated tartaric acid anhydride and mono- and diglycerides based on C12 to C22 fatty acids is carried out in a continuous maimer in a suitable reactor e.g. as outlined above.<br>
The products obtainable by the processes specified above can be finished by spray-cooling, cryogenic milling under an inert gas like liquid nitrogen, extrusion and/or taking up in a suitable extender like triglyceride or monoglycerides (known useful bakery improvers), also an anti-caking agent may be added such as e.g. calcium orthophosphate and calcium carbonate. They can be marketed directly as emulsifier, as dough conditioner, in flour and in bakery improvers (baking ingredients) for yeast-leavened baked products. The invention also provides the use of a mixture comprising diacetylated tartaric acid esters of mono- and diglycerides based on C12 to C22 fatty acids as specified above as emulsifier, dough conditioner, in improved flour (mixes) and in bakery improvers/baking ingredients for yeast-leavened baked products.<br>
The invention also provides baked products in which a mixture comprising diacetyl artaric acid esters on mono- and diglycerides based of CI2 to C22, preferably C16 to Z18, fatty acids as specified above has been incorporated. This includes baking ngredients for baked products more in particular for yeast-leavened products such as )read (especially white bread), tin bread, rolls, hard rolls, German crispy rolls, buns, rusks<br><br>
eic.<br>
All percentages and parts mentioned herein are on a molar basis unless otherwise<br>
indicated.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for preparing a mixture comprising diacetyl tartaric acid esters of mono and diglycerides derived from Ci2 to C22 fatty acids which mixture comprises diacetyl tartaric acid glycerol monoesters containing (A) one fatty acid group, one diacetylated tartaric acid monoester group and a free hydroxyl group and; (B) one fatty acid group and two diacetylated tartaric acid monoester groups in which the concentration of (A) in the total mixture obtained by dividing the molar amount of (A) by the sum of the molar amounts of all components in the mixture and multiplying by 100 is at least 45%), preferably at least 50% and the fraction obtained by dividing the molar amount of (A) by the combined molar amounts of (A) and (B) taken together is at least 0.70, preferably at least 0.72.<br>
The invention will now be described more in detail with reference to embodiments given by way of example in which;<br><br>
Example I<br>
Preparation of purified diacetvlated tartaric acid anhydride.<br>
100 g (0.67 mole) food grade L-(+)tartaric acid was slowly dosed to 250 g (2.45 moles) acetic anhydride (P.A.) in a conical flask of 500 ml capacity equipped with a reflux con¬denser and a magnetic stirrer. Prior to the dosing of tartaric acid, 2 microlitres concentrated sulphuric acid were dosed as a catalyst. The reaction was strongly exothermic and was controlled by the dosing speed of the tartaric acid after the initial rise in temperature. The mixture was boiled under reflux conditions for approximately 15 minutes. Then the mixture was slowly cooled to ambient temperature and diacetylated tartaric acid anhydride started to crystallise at a temperature below 60-65°C, A.t ambient temperature the mixture was cooled further with crushed ice to approximately 3-5°C and is then transferred to a Biichner funnel. The funnel itself was placed under a dry ^2 blanket to prevent hydrolysis of the diacetylated tartaric acid anhydride. The acetic acid A'SLS removed by applying vacuum to the funnel. When the acetic acid and excess acetic mhydride had been removed the white needle shaped crystals were washed three times vith diethyl ether (P.A.) of 3-5°C. Finally the cr&gt;'stals were transferred to a rotary evaporator equipped with a 2-litre powder flask. The crystals were dried at ambient emperature at approximately 10 kPa (100 mbar) pressure. To speed up the drying process, I small flow of dry N, was led through the rotary flask. The yield was 120-125 g, which ndicated an efficiency of 83-87% calculated on the tartaric acid. The white crystals were tored at 5°C in a dark, dp,' place. The whole procedure was carried out twice and the vhite cov'stals obtained were combined.<br>
'reparation of diacetvl tartaric acid esters of mono- and diglvcerides. '.61 g (0.75 moie) of distilled monoglyceride of mainly palmitic and stearic acid (Admul '.903K ex Quest) containing approximately 4% diglycendes were molten and 165 g (0.76 nole) of solid diacetylated tartaric acid anhydride as prepared abo\e were added to a<br><br>
rotary evaporator flask and the mixture was slowly further molten using an oil bath of 120°C for heating. After approximately 10 minutes the mixture was completely molten and 425.9 mg sodium stearate dispersed in Admul 8903K were dosed. After additional mixing for 5 minutes (total reaction time 15 minutes) the mixture was crash-cooled on a metal plate, powdered by cryogenic milled under liquid N2 and sieved to over 212 micrometers and a few percents of an anti-caking agent were added. The product showed outstanding baking properties. The product obtained was analysed by NMR and the results are shown below. Baking experiments Hard rolls were baked based on the following recipe<br><br>
(1)	wheat flour (low protein), Kolibri, ex Meneba, Rotterdam.<br>
(2)	"Koningsgist", ex Gist-Brocades, Delft, Netherlands.<br>
(3)	amount calculated as free from anti-caking agent.<br>
Hard rolls were baked with the diacetylated tartaric ester mixture according to Example 1<br>
and compared with hard rolls containing the same amount of a commercially available<br>
diacetylated tartaric ester of monoglyceride mixture (Admul Datem 1075, ex Quest,<br>
Naarden, Netherlands which was finished in the same way as described above. Both ester<br>
mixtures contained tartaric acid percentages of 27 % w.w.<br>
Processing:<br>
Kneading: "Kemper Spiral";<br><br>
Dough temperature: 27°C;<br>
Scaling: 1640 g;<br>
First proofing: 15 minutes in the bakery (25°C; 60% RH);<br>
Round up: by hand;<br>
Second proofing: 15 minutes in the bakery (32°C; 80% RH);<br>
Dividing, round up: "Record Automat";<br>
Rest proofing: 3 minutes in the bakery (25°C; 60% RH);<br>
Shaping: "Frilado" (rolls 5);<br>
Final proofing: 55 and 70 minutes (32°C; 80% RH);<br>
Baking: 19 minutes 230°C (oven program 1); on the oven floor with plenty steam.<br>
The NMR characteristics of both ester mixtures were determined and their baking properties as well as the baked hard rolls were evaluated by a team of experienced bakers. The results obtained are summarised below.<br><br><br><br>
Examples 2. 3. 4. 5, 6 and 7 Preparation of diacetylated tartaric acid anhydride.<br>
286 g (1.91 moles) food grade L-(+) tartaric acid were slowly dosed to 621 g (6.09 moles) acetic anhydride (P.A.) in a conical flask of 2 litre capacity equipped with a reflux condenser and a magnetic stirrer. Prior to the dosing of tartaric acid, 5 microlitres concentrated sulphuric acid were dosed as a catalyst. The reaction was strongly exothermic and was controlled by the dosing speed of the tartaric acid after the initial rise in temperature. After all the tartaric acid was dosed the mixture was transferred to a rotary evaporator and the acetic acid including the remaining acetic anhydride was distilled off under reduced pressure. The rotary flask was heated with an oil bath of approximately 140-150°C. this to prevent solidification of the diacetyl tartaric anhydride obtained. The yield was approximately 410 g indicating an efficiency of 99% based on tartaric acid. The molten diacetyl tartaric anhydride could be used directly for reaction with the mono-and/or diglycerides.<br>
Preparation of diacetyl tartaric acid esters of mono- and diglycerides. A mixture of 648 g (1.85 moles) of distilled monoglyceride of (palm oil based) C16 and CI8 fatty acids containing approximately 4 wt % diglycerides were molten a 2 litre Pyrex oil jacketed reaction vessel which was heated firom an oil bath to 140°C under a dry Nj blanket to prevent oxidation and to increase safety. When a temperature of 140°C was reached an Ultra Turrax immersed in the molten mixture was switched on to high speed (24 000 rpm) and diacetylated tartaric anhydride as prepared above was added in an amount of 410 g (1.90 moles) during approximately 15-20 seconds. The sodium stearate catalyst was dosed and the catalyst was quickly dispersed in Admul 8903K by the Ultra Turrax mixer, which also caused some heating. The reaction temperature was recorded with a PC using an Adam 4017 interface and Genie 2.0 software. After a reaction time of<br><br>
0.5, 1, 3, 10 and 20 minutes samples were taken for analyses and evaluation. After a reaction time of 20 minutes the reaction was terminated and the different products were flaked on a metal plate at ambient temperature and subsequently powdered by cryogenic milling. The products obtained were analysed by NMR.<br>
Comparative Examples 1, 2 and 3 represent the data of commercial products Panodan 90, ex Grindsted, Denmark found to contain 20 wt % fat on total sample, Beldem 2500, found to contain 30% fat on total sample ex Beldem, Belgium and Abitec PX, ex Abitec, UK found to contain 30% fat on total sample respectively all of which comprise DATEM esters based on distilled monoglycerides.<br>
Moreover an additional Example (Example 4) has been inserted in tables below. This additional Example having a reaction time of 2 minutes was based on a 60 wt % mono-diglyceride (Admul MG 6203, ex Quest, Naarden, Netherlands) and was prepared by a method similar to the route described above in this Example.<br>
These examples show that the preparation of diacetyl tartaric acid esters of mono- and diglycerides can be carried out well in high yield e.g. by contacting molten monoglycerides with molten acetylated tartaric acid anhydride under conditions of short reaction times combined with intensive agitation which indicates that this reaction is well-suited for continuous operation e.g. in a (multi)- tube reactor.<br>
The composition of the various reaction mixtures obtained was determined by NMR and the results are tabulated below.<br><br><br>
Examples 8. 9. 10 and 11<br>
Preparation of diacetvl tartaric acid esters of mono- and diglycerides.<br>
The procedure of Examples 2-7 described above was followed with some exceptions: the<br>
sequence order of introducing the ingredients was reversed; a blade stirrer was used; the<br>
amounts of diacetylated tartaric acid anhydride reacted were varied; the reaction time and<br>
method of cooling were changed to a reaction time of 2 minutes only and the vessel was<br>
cooled to 80°C in approximately 3 minutes by applying water of 60°C on a coil. These<br><br>
products which had excellent baking properties were flaked, subsequently powdered by cryogenic milling and sieved to over 212 micrometers and adding a few percents of an anti-caking agent. Baking experiments<br>
Hard rolls were baked based on the recipe given in Example 1 above. Tliese hard rolls were baked with the diacetylated tartaric ester mixture according to Examples 8 to 11 and compared with hard rolls containing the same amount of a commercially available diacetylated tartaric esters of monoglyceride mixtures (Admul Datem 1075, based on a mono-diglyceride mixture containing 60% monoglycerides, and Admul 1972, based on 95% pure monoglycerides respectively, ex Quest, Naarden, Netherlands which were finished in the same way as described above. The ester mixtures contained diacetylated tartaric acid in varying amounts indicated in the table below. The processing details were identical to those disclosed in Example 1.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
(1)	wheat flour (high protein), Kluut, ex Meneba, Rotterdam.<br>
(2)	"Koningsgist", ex Gist-Brocades, Delft, Netherlands.<br>
(3)	amount calculated as free from anti-caking agent.<br>
