				<td>METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR ALLOCATING RADIO RESOURCE<br>
USING RANDOM ACCESS PROCEDURE IN A MOBILE<br>
COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to a mobile communication system,<br>
and in particular, to a method and apparatus for efficiently allocating radio<br>
resources to transmit an uplink message of a terminal, or User Equipment (UE),<br>
by a network node.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
The Universal Mobile Telecommunication Service (UMTS) system is a 3rd<br>
Generation (3G) asynchronous mobile communication system employing<br>
Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA) based on Global System<br>
for Mobile Communications (GSM) and General Packet Radio Services (GPRS),<br>
both of which are European mobile communication systems. In 3rd Generation<br>
Partnership Project (3GPP) in charge of UMTS standardization, a Long Term<br>
Evolution (LTE) system is under discussion as the next generation mobile<br>
communication system of the UMTS system. The present invention will be<br>
described herein with reference to the LTE system, which will now be briefly<br>
described.<br>
LTE is a technology for implementing packet-based communication at a<br>
high data rate of a maximum of about 100 Mbps, aiming at commercialization in<br>
around 2010. To this end, several schemes are under discussion, such as one for<br>
reducing the number of nodes located in a communication path by simplifying a<br>
configuration of the network, and another for maximally approximating radio<br>
protocols to radio channels.<br>
FIG 1 illustrates an Evolved UMTS mobile communication system to<br>
which the present invention is applied.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, an Evolved UMTS Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN<br>
 <br>
or E-RAN) 110 is simplified to a 2-node configuration of Evolved Node Bs<br>
(ENBs) 120, 122, 124, 126 and 128, and anchor nodes 130 and 132. A UE 101, or<br>
terminal, accesses an Internet Protocol (IP) network by means of the E-UTRAN<br>
110.<br>
The ENBs 120 to 128 correspond to the existing Node B of the UMTS<br>
system, and are connected to the UE 101 over radio channels. Compared to the<br>
existing Node B, the ENBs 120 to 128 perform more complex functions.<br>
Particularly, in LTE, because all user traffic including the real-time services, such<br>
as Voice over IP (VoIP), is serviced over a shared channel, the ENB collects status<br>
information of UEs to perform scheduling depending thereon, and controls a<br>
function related to management of radio resources. In addition, control protocols,<br>
such as Radio Resource Control (RRC), are included in the ENBs 120 to 128.<br>
Generally, each ENB controls a plurality of cells.<br>
To realize the data rate of a maximum of 100 Mbps, LTE uses Orthogonal<br>
Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) as a radio access technology in a 20-<br>
MHz bandwidth. Further, the ENB performs Adaptive Modulation &amp; Coding<br>
(AMC) that adaptively determines a modulation scheme and a channel coding<br>
rate according to channel status of the UE 101.<br>
Like the mobile communication system supporting High Speed Downlink<br>
Packet Access (HSDPA), High Speed Uplink Packet Access (HSUPA), and<br>
Enhanced Dedicated Channel (E-DCH) services, the LTE system also performs<br>
Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest (HARQ) between the UE 101 and the ENBs<br>
120 to 128. Because various Quality of Service (QoS) requirements cannot be<br>
satisfied only with HARQ, Outer ARQ in the upper layer can be performed<br>
between the UE 101 and the ENBs 120 to 128.<br>
The HARQ is a technique for soft-combining previously received data with<br>
retransmitted data without discarding the previously received data, thereby<br>
increasing the reception success rate. This is used to increase the transmission<br>
efficiency in high-speed communication such as HSDPA and EDCH.<br>
The random access procedure to which the present invention is applied is<br>
 <br>
used as a procedure between a UE and a network node, in which a UE in RRC<br>
idle mode or an RRC connected mode matches uplink timing sync with the ENB<br>
for (initial) uplink message/data transmission, sets initial uplink transmission<br>
power, and/or requests radio resource allocation for the (initial) uplink<br>
message/data transmission. For a definition of the RRC idle mode and RRC<br>
connected mode, reference can be made to the 3GPP TR25.813v700 standard.<br>
In brief, the RRC idle mode generally refers to a state of a UE, in which the<br>
ENB has no context information for the UE and the anchor node, or upper node,<br>
has context information of the UE, so a location of the UE is managed not in units<br>
of cells but in units of tracking area for paging.<br>
The RRC connected mode refers to a state of a UE, in which not only the<br>
anchor node but also the ENB have the context information of the UE and an<br>
RRC connection is set up between the UE and the ENB, so the location of the UE<br>
can be managed in units of cells.<br>
FIG 2 illustrates a conventional random access procedure in a 3GPP LTE<br>
system.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, reference numeral 210 denotes a UE, and reference<br>
numeral 211 denotes an ENB that controls the cell in which the UE 210 is located.<br>
Step 221 indicates an operation in which the UE 210 triggers a random<br>
access procedure. For example, this can indicate the case where to start a call, an<br>
RRC idle mode UE (UE in the RRC idle mode) needs to transmit an uplink<br>
control message which allows the ENB 211 to acquire UE context information,<br>
set up an RRC connection between the UE 210 and the ENB 211, and transmit a<br>
service request to an anchor node.<br>
If the random access procedure is triggered in step 221, the UE 210<br>
randomly selects one of a total of X random access preambles agreed with the<br>
ENB 211 in step 231. Thereafter, in step 241, the UE 210 transmits the selected<br>
random access preamble to the ENB 211 over a predetermined channel/time.<br>
 <br>
When transmitting the random access preamble in step 241, the UE 210 sets<br>
initial random access preamble's transmission power of UE by applying Open<br>
Loop Power Control (OLPC). Equation (1) shows the conventional manner of<br>
performing the conventional OLPC.<br>
PTX = Lpilot + IBTS + SIRTARGET      	(1)<br>
The parameters of Equation (1) are defined as follows:<br>
-	PTX : a transmission power level [dBm] of a channel DPCH;<br>
-	Lpilot: a path loss [dB] estimated using a measure of a downlink pilot<br>
charuiel and a transmission power of a signaled pilot channel;<br>
-	IBTS : an interference level that a receiver of an ENB (or Base Transceiver<br>
System (BTS)) experiences;<br>
-	SIRTARET: a target Signal-to-Interference Ratio (SIR) [dB] for<br>
maintaining the transmission quality of each UE. It can be either signaled<br>
separately for each UE or signaled commonly for all UEs.<br>
If the random access preamble is retransmitted due to the failure in the<br>
initial random access preamble transmission of step 241, a delta value (hereinafter<br>
power ramp step) is added to the power that is set during the previous random<br>
access preamble transmission. The power ramp step can be either signaled, or<br>
defined as a specific value.<br>
In step 242, the ENB 211 transmits to the UE 210 a response message to the<br>
random access preamble received in step 241. The response message 242 includes<br>
such information as a random access preamble identifier indicating the random<br>
access preamble received in step 231, uplink timing sync information for<br>
matching uplink timing sync and radio resource allocation information for<br>
transmission 251 of the next uplink upper message of the UE 210.<br>
In the transmission of the response message by the ENB 211 in step 242,<br>
the ENB 211 can perform synchronous transmission using the timing relationship<br>
determined for the transmission of step 241 by the UE 210.<br>
If the information received in step 242 includes a random access preamble<br>
 <br>
IDentifier (ID) mapped to the random access preamble transmitted in step 241 by<br>
the UE 210 itself, the UE 210 corrects the uplink transmission timing, using the<br>
uplink timing sync information included in the received information of step 242.<br>
In step 251, the UE 210 transmits the corresponding upper message over the<br>
corresponding channel/time using the allocated radio resources.<br>
The message transmitted in step 251 can be an RRC message or a Non-<br>
Access Stratum (NAS) message. Alternative, the message can be a combined<br>
message of the RRC message and the NAS message. Here, the RRC message<br>
indicates a message for Radio Resource Control (RRC), having a UE and an ENB<br>
as protocol endpoints, and the NAS message indicates a message for controlling<br>
parameters such as mobility, service and session of a UE, having a UE and an<br>
anchor node as protocol endpoints.<br>
However, in the 3GPP UTE system that performs the random access procedure of<br>
FIG 2, when the ENB 211 allocates, to the UE 210, radio resources for<br>
transmission of an upper message in step 242, it can perform resource allocation<br>
only for the message size guaranteed such that all UEs in the cell can transmit the<br>
message. This is because when the ENB 211 receives the random access<br>
preamble from the UE 210 in step 241, the information transmitted through the<br>
random access preamble only includes a random ID.<br>
In other words, the random access preambles have only the random IDs<br>
without including other information, to prevent the UE 210 from selecting the<br>
same random access preamble, thus preventing occurrence of the collision.<br>
Therefore, because the ENB 211, receiving this random access preamble,<br>
cannot acquire any information necessary for scheduling, from the random access<br>
preamble, even though the UE is located in the cell boundary, the ENB 211<br>
cannot allocate the radio resources for the transmission-guaranteed message size.<br>
Therefore, the random access procedure of the mobile communication<br>
system shown in FIG 2 is inefficient in scheduling the next message transmitted<br>
from the UE 210 by the ENB 211.<br>
 <br>
In addition, if the ENB 211 includes in the random access preambles the<br>
information (e.g., cause/type information of the random access procedure, priority<br>
information of the random access procedure and radio channel condition<br>
information) capable of assisting in performing scheduling, the ENB 211 may<br>
very efficiently perform scheduling on the next message transmitted from the UE<br>
210.<br>
However, the number of random access preambles that the UE can<br>
guarantee the transmission at any place in the cell is limited, using the limited<br>
radio resources when there is no RRC connection set up between the UE and the<br>
ENB.<br>
To carry all the information on the limited random access preambles<br>
decreases the number of random IDs that reduce the collision probability, thereby<br>
causing the increasing collision problem that multiple UEs select the same<br>
random access preamble in the random access procedure, in which procedure an<br>
increase in the collision probability to at least a certain level may raise a fatal<br>
problem.<br>
Therefore, the current mobile communication system needs an efficient<br>
random access procedure for solving the foregoing problems.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
 <br>
Preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described in<br>
detail with reference to the annexed drawings. In the following description, a<br>
detailed description of known functions and configurations incorporated herein<br>
has been omitted for the sake of clarity and conciseness.<br>
Although the present invention will be described herein with reference to a<br>
Long Term Evolution (3GPP LTE) system evolved from the 3rd Generation<br>
Partnership Project (3GPP) Universal Mobile Telecommunication Service<br>
(UMTS) system, by way of example, the present invention can be applied to all<br>
mobile communication systems to which ENB scheduling is applied, without<br>
separate modification.<br>
In addition, the present invention can be applied to the communication<br>
systems to which the random access procedure is applied, without separate<br>
modification. Further, the present invention can be applied to the systems<br>
supporting uplink services.<br>
The present invention provides a scheme in which a network node can<br>
efficiently allocate radio resources to transmit an uplink message from a UE upon<br>
receipt of a random access preamble through efficient random access preamble<br>
design in a random access procedure.<br>
Therefore, when a UE is in a good radio channel condition and a size of a<br>
message that the UE will transmit after transmitting a random access preamble<br>
and receiving a response thereto is greater than a predefined minimum message<br>
size, the present invention separately defines a random access preamble set that<br>
the UE will select in the random access procedure. In another case, i.e. when the<br>
radio channel condition of the UE is not good or the size of the message that the<br>
UE will transmit after transmitting a random access preamble and receiving a<br>
response thereto is less than or equal to the predefined minimum message size,<br>
the present invention separately defines a random access preamble set that the UE<br>
will select in the random access procedure.<br>
In addition, when the UE is in the good radio channel condition and the size<br>
of the transmission message is greater than the predefined minimum message size,<br>
 <br>
the UE provides the information to the network node with use of the<br>
corresponding random access preamble set, so the network node can allocate<br>
radio resources so that it can transmit a message greater than the predefined<br>
minimum message size over a response message to the random access preamble.<br>
Further, when the radio channel condition of the UE is not good or the size<br>
of the message that the UE will transmit after transmitting the random access<br>
preamble and receiving a response thereto is less than or equal to the predefined<br>
minimum message size, the UE provides the information to the network node<br>
with use of the random access preamble set corresponding thereto, so the network<br>
node can allocate radio resources so that it can transmit a message corresponding<br>
only to the predefined minimum message size over a response message to the<br>
random access preamble.<br>
Therefore, the present invention provides a scheme for allowing an ENB to<br>
efficiently perform scheduling on the next message sent from a UE by including<br>
the minimum supplemental information in the random access preamble design.<br>
According to the present invention, the supplemental information indicates<br>
an occasion when a UE is in a radio channel condition that is greater than a<br>
threshold Y and a size of the message that the UE will transmit next is greater<br>
than a transmission-guaranteed minimum message size Z even though the UE is<br>
located in the cell boundary.<br>
That is, a total of X random access preambles agreed between the UE and<br>
the ENB are divided into two sets. One arbitrary set A is defined to indicate an<br>
occasion when the UE is in a radio channel condition that is greater than the<br>
threshold Y and a size of the next message that the UE will transmit is greater<br>
than the minimum message size Z. Another set B is defined to be used when the<br>
above condition is unsatisfied.<br>
As a result, upon receipt of a random access preamble corresponding to the<br>
set A, the ENB can allocate radio resources for transmission of a message greater<br>
than Z when scheduling transmission of the next message of the UE. However,<br>
upon receipt of a random access preamble corresponding to the set B, the ENB<br>
can allocate radio resources for transmission of a message with the size Z when<br>
 <br>
scheduling transmission of the next message of the UE.<br>
The threshold Y used for determining a good radio channel condition or the<br>
size Z of a message, transmission of which is guaranteed even in the cell<br>
boundary, can be either determined as one value regardless the cell and undergo<br>
hard-coding, or signaled through broadcasted system information according to<br>
cells.<br>
It is noted that throughout the description herein, a radio channel condition<br>
that is determined to be greater than a threshold, indicates that the radio channel<br>
condition is better than a condition related to the particular threshold.<br>
Table 1 shows an example of the random access preamble design disclosed<br>
in the present invention when the total number of random access preambles is<br>
assumed to be X=64. Although the set A and the set B are equal in the number<br>
X/2 of allocated random access preambles in Table 1, by way of example, the set<br>
A and the set B may be different in the number of random access preambles<br>
allocated thereto.<br>
Table 1<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
<br>
 <br>
Although not shown herein, the present invention can be extended as<br>
follows. For example, if other 2-bit information except for a random ID can be<br>
included in a random access preamble, the random access preamble can be<br>
designed as the following Sets A-D.<br>
-	Random Access Preamble Set A: This set is used when a radio channel<br>
condition is determined to be greater than a than a threshold Yl and a size of the<br>
message that the UE will transmit next is greater than a minimum size Zl of a<br>
message transmittable even in the cell boundary, and less than or equal to a<br>
particular size Z2.<br>
-	Random Access Preamble Set B: This set is used when a radio channel<br>
condition is determined to be greater than a threshold Y2 and a size of the<br>
message that the UE will transmit next is greater than the particular size Z2<br>
limited to the random access preamble set # A, and less than or equal to a<br>
 <br>
particular size Z3.<br>
-	Random Access Preamble Set C: This set is used when a radio channel<br>
condition is determined to be greater than a threshold Y3 and a size of the<br>
message that the UE will transmit next is greater than a particular size Z3 limited<br>
to the random access preamble set #B, and less than or equal to a particular size<br>
Z4.<br>
-	Random Access Preamble Set #D: This set is used when a radio channel<br>
condition is determined to be greater than a threshold Y4 and a size of the<br>
message that the UE will transmit next is greater than a particular size Z4 limited<br>
to the random access preamble set #B.<br>
FIG. 3 illustrates an example of a random access procedure obtained based<br>
on the random access preamble design disclosed in the present invention.<br>
Reference numeral 310 denotes a UE, and reference numeral 311 denotes an ENB<br>
that controls and manages the cell in which the UE 310 is located.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, step 321 indicates an operation in which the UE 310<br>
triggers the random access procedure. For example, this can indicate the case<br>
where to start a call, an RRC idle mode UE needs to transmit an uplink control<br>
message.<br>
Step 323 indicates an operation in which random access procedure-related<br>
control parameters are broadcasted as system information in the cell. The random<br>
access procedure-related parameters can include such information as radio<br>
resource allocation information used for performing the random access procedure<br>
and radio channel condition threshold Y, transmission power.<br>
The radio resource allocation information used for the random access<br>
procedure indicates time/frequency radio resources with which the UE 310 will<br>
transmit a random access preamble in the random access procedure. The radio<br>
channel condition threshold Y is a criterion used when the UE 310 determines in<br>
step 331 whether it is in a good radio channel condition. The transmission power<br>
is a value used when the UE 310 determines the radio channel condition.<br>
 <br>
In particular, the transmission power is a value used when calculating a path<br>
loss in the radio channel condition, and the path loss can be calculated using<br>
Equation (2), as follows.<br>
Path Loss = Transmission Power - Reception Power      	(2)<br>
Herein, the path loss is a value acquired in a long term determined by such<br>
parameters as propagation loss, shadowing, slow fading and antenna pattern, and<br>
because the downlink and uplink show the similar values, the path loss<br>
information can be used for estimating the uplink channel status.<br>
Although it is shown in FIG. 3 that step 323 is performed after step 321, if the UE<br>
310 has already acquired the latest random access procedure-related parameter<br>
through the previous system information before the random access procedure is<br>
triggered in step 321, the UE 310 can perform the next step 331 immediately after<br>
the random access procedure is triggered in step 321, since the system<br>
information including the random access procedure-related parameter is<br>
periodically transmitted in the cell. Thus, if the UE 310 has already acquired the<br>
latest random access procedure-related parameter before step 321, the reception<br>
of the system information in step 323 can be omitted.<br>
Upon receiving the random access procedure-related parameter through the<br>
system information in step 331, the UE 310 determines based on the parameter<br>
whether it is in a radio channel condition that is greater than a threshold Y and a<br>
size of the message that the UE 310 will transmit is greater than a minimum<br>
message size Z transmission-guaranteed in the cell boundary.<br>
The radio channel condition can be determined by two separate methods. In<br>
a first method, the UE uses Channel Quality Information (CQI) indicating a<br>
received Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) obtained by measuring a downlink pilot. In<br>
a second method, the UE 310 uses the path loss information defined in Equation<br>
(2) rather than the channel quality information.<br>
Herein, the channel quality information indicates a value obtained by<br>
 <br>
considering fast fading, and because the fast fading occurs independently in the<br>
downlink and the uplink, the channel quality information may not be suitable to<br>
be used for estimating the uplink channel status and performing scheduling for<br>
transmission of the initial uplink message. Therefore, the path loss information is<br>
used instead of the channel quality information. Generally, because the path loss<br>
is similar to some extent in both the downlink and the uplink, the path loss,<br>
compared to the channel quality information, may be suitable for estimating the<br>
uplink channel status and performing scheduling for transmission of the initial<br>
uplink message. That is, the channel quality information and the path loss are<br>
interchangeable as parameters than can be used for estimating the uplink channel<br>
status, and can be selected based on the circumstances or the system designer's<br>
choice.<br>
Although the present invention uses a method of comparing the path loss<br>
information with a threshold Y, by way of example, the present invention does not<br>
exclude a method of comparing the channel quality information with a threshold<br>
Y.<br>
Therefore, in step 331, the UE 310 determines a path loss in accordance<br>
with Equation (2) using the transmission power received in step 323 and the<br>
reception power for a downlink pilot channel measured for a set interval.<br>
Thereafter, the UE 310 compares the acquired path loss with the radio channel<br>
condition threshold Y received in step 323. If the path loss is less than or equal to<br>
the threshold Y, it is determined that the UE 310 is in a radio channel condition<br>
that is greater than the threshold Y. This is because the path loss has an inverse<br>
proportional relationship with the decision on whether the UE 310 is in the good<br>
radio channel condition.<br>
However, if the channel quality information is used according to the second<br>
method, the channel quality inlbrmation has a proportional relationship between<br>
with the decision on whether the UE 310 is in the good radio channel condition.<br>
Accordingly, the UE 310 determines in step 331 a received SNR for the downlink<br>
pilot channel measured for an interval. Thereafter, the UE 310 compares it with<br>
the radio channel condition threshold Y received in step 323. If the channel<br>
quality information is greater than or equal to the threshold Y, the UE 310<br>
 <br>
determines that it is in the radio channel condition that is greater than the<br>
threshold Y.<br>
Further, in step 331, the UE 310 determines whether a size of the<br>
transmission message is greater than the minimum message size Z transmission-<br>
guaranteed in the cell boundary. As to the minimum message size Z checked<br>
herein, the minimum message size can be set to one standard value, or a different<br>
value can be signaled for every cell through the system information of step 323.<br>
As a result, if the UE 310 determines in step 331 that it is in a radio channel<br>
condition that is greater than a threshold Y and a size of the message that the UE<br>
310 will transmit over the uplink is greater than the minimum message size<br>
transmission-guaranteed even in the cell boundary, the UE 310 proceeds to step<br>
332.<br>
In step 332, the UE 310 randomly selects one random access preamble from<br>
a random access preamble set mapped to the above condition. However, if the<br>
condition of step 331 is not satisfied, the UE 310 randomly selects one random<br>
access preamble from another random access preamble set separatel\ defined<br>
according to the present invention.<br>
For example, under the assumption of the random access preamble design<br>
shown in Table 1, if, as given on the condition of step 331, the UE 310 is in the<br>
radio channel condition that is greater than the threshold Y and the size of the<br>
message that it will transmit over an upper message is greater than the minimum<br>
message size transmission-guaranteed even in the cell boundary, the UE 310<br>
randomly selects one of the random access preambles #0 - #31 in the random<br>
access preamble set A.<br>
However, if the condition of step 331 is not satisfied, the UE 310 randomly<br>
selects one of the random access preambles #32 - #63 in the random access<br>
preamble set B.<br>
In step 341, the UE 310 transmits the random access preamble selected in<br>
step 332 to the ENB 311. In step 342, the END 311 determines which condition<br>
 <br>
the received random access preamble satisfies. That is, the ENB 311 determines<br>
to which set the received random access preamble corresponds, and based thereon,<br>
allocates radio resources for allowing the UE 310 to transmit an upper message<br>
over the uplink, considering the status information (e.g., radio channel condition)<br>
of the UE 310.<br>
For example, if the random access preamble received in step 341 is one of<br>
the random access preambles #0 - #31 in set A, the ENB 311 can allocate in step<br>
342 radio resources for message transmission such that the UE 310 can transmit a<br>
message, a size of which is greater than the miniraum message size transmission-<br>
guaranteed in the cell boundary.<br>
However, if the random access preamble received in step 341 is one of the<br>
random access preambles #32 - #63 in set B, the ENB 311 allocates in step 342<br>
radio resources for message transmission such that the UE 310 can transmit a<br>
message, a size of which equals to the minimum message size transmission-<br>
guaranteed in the cell boundary.<br>
In step 343, the ENB 311 transmits to the UE 310 a response message to the<br>
random access preamble received in step 341. The response message includes a<br>
random access preamble identifier indicating such information as the received<br>
random access preamble, uplink timing sync information for matching uplink<br>
timing sync and radio resource information for the next uplink upper message<br>
transmission.<br>
The response message transmission of step 343 can be synchronized to the<br>
random access preamble transmission of step 341 with a set liming relationship.<br>
That is, if the UE 310 determines that the information received in step 343<br>
includes a random access preamble identifier mapped to the random access<br>
preamble transmitted in step 341 by the UE 310 itself, the UE 310 corrects the<br>
uplink transmission timing using the uplink timing sync information included in<br>
the information received in step 343.<br>
In step 351, the UE 310 transmits the corresponding upper message at the<br>
corresponding channel/time using the radio resources allocated in step 343. Here,<br>
 <br>
the message transmitted in step 351 can be either an RRC message or a NAS<br>
message. Altemalively, the message can be a combined message of the RRC<br>
message and the NAS message. The RRC message indicates a message for Radio<br>
Resource Control (RRC), having a UE and an ENB as protocol endpoints. and the<br>
NAS message indicates a message for controlling parameters such as mobility,<br>
service and session of a UE, having a UE and an anchor node as protocol<br>
endpoints.<br>
In addition, the ENB 311 can broadcast in step 323 an interference level at<br>
an ENB antenna instead of the radio channel condition threshold Y. This can be<br>
defined as a third method.<br>
Then, in step 331, if its maximum transmission power (Maximum UE<br>
transmission power) is greater than or equal to a sum of the received interference<br>
information at an ENB antenna (Interference at ENB), a path loss measured in<br>
decibels [dB] calculated using transmission power and reception power for a<br>
downlink pilot channel, and an alpha, the UE 310 determines that it is in a good<br>
radio channel condition. For this, reference can be made to Equation (3) below.<br>
Herein, the alpha can be either fixed to one standard value, or transmitted in the<br>
system information broadcasted in step 323.<br>
However, in step 331, if the maximum transmission power of the UE 310 is<br>
less than or equal to the sum of the received interference information at the HNB<br>
antenna, the path loss calculated using transmission power and reception power<br>
for the downlink pilot channel, and the alpha, the UE 310 determines that it is not<br>
in the good radio channel condition. In addition, if the maximum transmission<br>
power of the UE 310 is greater than the sum of the received interference<br>
information at the ENB antenna, the path loss calculated using transmission<br>
power and reception power for the downlink pilot channel, and the alpha, the UE<br>
310 determines that it is in the good radio channel condition.<br>
However, if the maximum transmission power of the UE 310 is less than the<br>
sum of the received interference information at the ENB antenna, the path loss<br>
calculated using transmission power and reception power for the downlink pilot<br>
channel, and the alpha, the UE 310 may determine that it is not the good radio<br>
 <br>
channel condition. In addition, if the maximum transmission power of the UE 310<br>
is greater than or equal to the sum of the received interference information at the<br>
ENB antenna, the path loss calculated using transmission power and reception<br>
power for the downlink pilot channel, and the alpha, the UE 310 may determine<br>
that it is in the good radio channel condition. In the aforementioned Equation (3),<br>
1.	Maximum UE Transmission Power &gt; Interference at ENB + Path Loss +<br>
Alpha [dB]: UE is in good radio channel condition<br>
2.	Maximum UE Transmission Power 
Alpha [dB]: UE is not in good radio channel condition<br>
	(3)<br>
As described above, the UE 310 checks its own radio channel condition<br>
depending on the random access procedure-related parameters broadcasted in the<br>
cell, and separately selects a random access preamble from set A or set B, which<br>
is a random access preamble selection condition, considering its own radio<br>
channel condition and the minimum size necessary for the next uplink upper<br>
message transmission.<br>
The ENB 311 determines whether the random access preamble received<br>
from the UE 310 is transmitted from the separated set A or set B, thereby<br>
efficiently allocating radio resources.<br>
FIG. 4 illustrates a UE's operation of selecting a random access preamble<br>
from a set separated based on the random access preamble design according to the<br>
present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG 4, if a random access procedure is triggered in step 410,<br>
the UE checks in step 411 whether it is in a radio channel condition that is greater<br>
than a threshold Y and a size of the message that the UE will transmit next is<br>
greater than the minimum message size Z transmission-guaranteed in the cell<br>
boundary. In step 411, the UE can determine whether it is in a radio channel<br>
condition that is greater than a threshold in the method described in FIG. 3.<br>
If the UE determines in step 421 that the condition of step 411 is satisfied,<br>
i.e. if the UE is in a radio channel condition that is greater than the threshold and<br>
 <br>
the size of the message that the UE will transmit next is greater than the minimum<br>
message size Z transmission-guaranteed in the cell boundary, the UE proceeds to<br>
step 431.<br>
In step 431, the UE selects a random access preamble set used when the<br>
condition of step 411, guaranteeing the radio channel condition, is satisfied. For<br>
example, the UE will select the random access preamble set A of Table 1.<br>
However, if the UE determines that the condition of step 411 is not satisfied, the<br>
UE proceeds to step 432 where it selects another random access preamble set<br>
separated from the random access preamble set guaranteeing the radio channel<br>
condition. For example, the UE will select the random access preamble set B of<br>
Table 1.<br>
In step 441, the UE randomly selects one random access preamble from the<br>
random access preamble set separately selected in step 431 or 432. Thereafter, in<br>
step 451, the UE transmits the selected random access preamble to an ENB (or<br>
network node) over the uplink using the time/frequency radio resources allocated<br>
for the random access procedure.<br>
FIG 5 illustrates an ENB's operation of allocating radio resources based on<br>
the random access preamble design according to the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5, in step 510, the ENB receives a random access<br>
preamble from a UE over a channel allocated for a random access procedure. In<br>
step 511, the ENB determines in which random access preamble set the random<br>
access preamble is included, by extracting the received random access preamble.<br>
If it is determined that the random access preamble set determined in step<br>
511 is included in the preamble set used when the UE is in a good radio channel<br>
condition and a size of the message that the UE will transmit next is greater than<br>
the minimum message size transmission-guaranteed in the cell boundary ('YES'<br>
in step 521), the ENB proceeds to step 531.<br>
In step 531, the ENB allocates radio resources so that the UE can transmit<br>
a  message,  a  size  of which   is  greater  than  the  minimum  message size<br>
 <br>
transmission-guaranteed in the cell boundary, for the message that the UE will<br>
transmit next.<br>
However, if the ENB determines that the random access preamble set<br>
determined in step 511 corresponds to another preamble set separated from the<br>
preamble set corresponding to the condition of step 521 ('NO' in step 521), the<br>
ENB proceeds to step 532.<br>
In step 532, the ENB allocates radio resources so that the UE can transmit a<br>
message, a size of which is equal to the minimum message size transmission-<br>
guaranteed even in the cell boundary, for the message that the UE will transmit<br>
next.<br>
In step 541, the ENB transmits, along with a response message to the<br>
random access preamble, radio resource information for the message that the UE,<br>
allocated the radio resources in step 531 or 532, will transmit next.<br>
FIG 6 illustrates a block diagram of a UE's apparatus for selecting a<br>
random access preamble from a set separated based on the random access<br>
preamble design according to the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 6, the UE includes a radio channel condition determiner<br>
611, a message size determiner 612, a random access preamble set selector 621, a<br>
random access preamble selector 631 and a transceiver 641.<br>
The radio channel condition determiner 611 determines whether the radio<br>
channel condition of the UE is greater than a threshold Y. As described in FIG. 3,<br>
the radio channel condition determiner 611 determines the radio channel<br>
condition depending on such information as CQI, a path loss and an interference<br>
level at an ENB antenna.<br>
The message size determiner 612 determines a size of the message that the<br>
UE will transmit next over the uplink. The message size determiner 612<br>
determines whether the message size is greater cr less than the minimum message<br>
size transmission-guaranteed even in the cell boundary.<br>
 <br>
The random access preamble set selector 621 selects a random access<br>
preamble set that the UE will use, according to the decisions made by the radio<br>
channel condition determiner 611 and the message size determiner 612. The<br>
random access preamble set can be separated into one set used when the radio<br>
channel condition is greater than the threshold Y and a size of the message that<br>
the UE will transmit next is greater than the minimum message size transmittable<br>
even in the cell boundary, and another set used when the above condition is not<br>
satisfied. That is, the random access preamble set selector 621 selects one of the<br>
set A and set B, which are random access preamble sets separated considering the<br>
provided radio channel condition information and the message size information<br>
necessary for the next uplink upper message transmission.<br>
For example, if the UE is in a radio chanr.el condition that is greater than<br>
the threshold Y and a size of the message that the UE will transmit over an upper<br>
message is greater than the minimum message size transmission-guaranteed even<br>
in the cell boundary, the random access preamble set selector 621 selects the<br>
random access preamble set A. However, if the above condition is not satisfied,<br>
the random access preamble set selector 621 selects the random access preamble<br>
set B separated from the random access preamble set A.<br>
The random access preamble selector 631 randomly selects one random<br>
access preamble from the random access preamble set selected by the random<br>
access preamble set selector 621.<br>
The transceiver 641 transmits the random access preamble selected by the<br>
random access preamble selector 631 to the ENB using the allocated<br>
time/frequency radio resource.<br>
FIG 7 illustrates a block diagram of an ENB's apparatus for allocating radio<br>
resources based on the random access preamble design according to the present<br>
invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 7, the ENB includes a transceiver 711, a random access<br>
preamble extractor 721, a random access preamble set determiner 731. a<br>
 <br>
scheduler 741 and a random access preamble response message generator 751.<br>
The transceiver 711 receives a random access channel from a UE. The<br>
random access preamble extractor 721 extracts the random access preamble<br>
transmitted by the UE using the received random access channel.<br>
The random access preamble set determiner 731 determines to which<br>
random access preamble set the random access preamble parsed by the random<br>
access preamble extractor 721 corresponds. The acquired random access preamble<br>
set result is delivered to the scheduler 741.<br>
The scheduler 741 determines the radio channel condition of the UE<br>
depending on the acquired random access preamble set. Therefore, the scheduler<br>
741 determines radio resource allocation considering the radio channel condition<br>
when allocating radio resources for the next transmission message of the UE.<br>
The random access preamble response message generator 751 transmits<br>
information on the radio resources allocated by the scheduler 741 to the UE via<br>
the transceiver 711, along with the random access preamble response message. If<br>
the random access preamble set determined by the random access preamble set<br>
determiner 731 is the set used when the radio channel condition of the UE is<br>
greater than the threshold Y and the size of the message that the UE will transmit<br>
next is greater than the minimum message size transmittable even in the cell<br>
boundary, the scheduler 741 allocates radio resources for a message, a size of<br>
which is greater than the minimum message size, for the next transmission<br>
message of the UE.<br>
However, if it is determined that the random access preamble set checked by<br>
the random access preamble set determiner 731 belongs to another random access<br>
preamble set that cannot satisfy the above condition, the scheduler 741 allocates<br>
radio resources corresponding to the minimum message size for the next<br>
transmission message of the UE.<br>
As is apparent from the foregoing description, the present invention<br>
provides a method and apparatus for allocating resources to guarantee the<br>
 <br>
message size transmittablc by the UE considering the radio channel condition of<br>
the UE in the next generation mobile communication system.<br>
According to the present invention, the UE selects a random access<br>
preamble from the set separated considering the radio channel condition and the<br>
message size. That is, the UE selects and transmits the random access preamble<br>
guaranteeing the collision between UEs, thereby performing the procedure for<br>
guaranteeing reliability between the UE performing the random access procedure<br>
and the upper network node.<br>
Further, according to the present invention, the network node allocates radio<br>
resources fully considering the radio channel condition of the UE, thereby<br>
contributing to an increase in efficiency of the limited radio resources.<br>
As a result, the present invention provides an efficient random access<br>
procedure in the mobile communication system, to allocate efficient radio<br>
resources for uplink transmission of the UE.<br>
While the invention has been shown and described with reference to a<br>
certain preferred embodiment thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the<br>

than a message size transmission-guaranteed in a cell boundary, when scheduling<br>
transmission of a message that the UE will transmit after the transmission of the<br>
random access preamble.<br>
13.	The apparatus of claim 11, wherein the random access preamble<br>
set selector selects a second random access preamble set when the radio channel<br>
condition is not greater than the threshold and the size of the message that the UE<br>
will transmit after the transmission of the random access preamble is less than or<br>
equal to the minimum message size;<br>
wherein the second random access preamble set indicates that the l.ENB<br>
allocates radio resources for transmission of a message, a size of which is equal to<br>
a message size transmission-guaranteed in a cell boundary, when scheduling<br>
transmission of a message that the UE will transmit after the transmission of the<br>
random access preamble.<br>
14.	The apparatus of claim 11, wherein the radio channel condition<br>
determiner determines the radio channel condition by comparing channel quality<br>
information with the radio channel condition threshold.<br>
15.	The apparatus of claim 11, wherein the radio channel condition<br>
determiner determines the radio channel condition by comparing path loss<br>
information with the radio channel condition threshold.<br>
16.	The apparatus of claim 11, wherein the radio channel condition<br>
determiner determines the radio channel condition by comparing maximum<br>
transmission power of the UE with a sum of received interference information at<br>
an ENB antenna, a path loss calculated using transmission power and reception<br>
power for a downlink pilot channel, and an alpha.<br>
17.	An Evolved Node B (ENB) apparatus for allocating radio<br>
resources using a random access procedure in a mobile communication system,<br>
the apparatus comprising:<br>
 <br>
a receiver for receiving a random access channel from a User Equipment<br>
(UE);<br>
a random access preamble extractor for extracting a random access<br>
preamble from the random access channel;<br>
a random access preamble set determiner for determining one of random<br>
access preamble sets predefined between the UE and the ENB, to which the<br>
extracted random access preamble belongs; and<br>
a scheduler for allocating radio resources according to the determined<br>
random access preamble set.<br>
18.	The apparatus of claim 17, wherein the scheduler allocates radio<br>
resources for transmission of a message, a size of which is greater than a message<br>
size transmission-guaranteed in a cell boundary', when it is determined from the<br>
determined random access preamble set that a size of a message that the UE will<br>
transmit after transmission of a random access preamble is greater than a<br>
minimum message size transmission-guaranteed in the cell boundary.<br>
19.	The apparatus of claim 17, wherein the scheduler allocates radio<br>
resources for transmission of a message, a size of which is equal to a message size<br>
transmission-guaranteed in a cell boundary, when it is determined from the<br>
determined random access preamble set that a size of a message that the UE will<br>
transmit after transmission of a random access preamble is less than or equal to a<br>
minimum message size transmission-guaranteed in the cell boundary.<br>
 <br>
A method for transmitting a random access preamble using a random access procedure in a mobile communication system. The random access<br>
preamble transmission method includes selecting, upon triggering of the random access procedure, one of random access preamble sets predefined between a User Equipment (UE) and an Evolved Node B (ENB) according to whether a radio channel condition is greater than a radio channel condition threshold and a size of a message that the UE will transmit after transmission of the random access preamble is greater than a minimum message size, randomly selecting a random access preamble from the selected random access preamble set, and<br>
transmitting the selected random access preamble to the ENB over a random access channel.</td>
