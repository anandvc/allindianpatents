The invention relates to a spinning frame. It differs from conventional ring spinning frames by a drawing unit, which is being combined with a condensing device, basically in form of a suction drum. A suction drum for a spirming frame with a condensing device has for instance been described in the German patent application 19 917 181.5, whereat in the mentioned application a suction drum with a profiled outer surface is being disclosed.<br>
US 6318060 describes a method and device for the production of core yam whereby a core yarn in brought to a fiber slubbing which has been refined in a drafting system before said slubbing is reinforced by twisting.<br>
Ring spinning frames with condensing devices are being further improved for a wide range of applications. Accordingly the components need to be optimised according to their specific application so that the drawing and condensing process runs smoothly. According to the invention, between a drawing unit of a spinning frame and a condensing device, an upper outlet roller is being pressed against a condensing element. While the roving is being drawn in the drafting unit between a first roller pair and a second roller pair and the third roller pair, that is the upper outlet roller and the condensing element, the drawn fibres are being compressed within the zone along the condensing element between the elements, upper outlet roller and the clamping roller, being pressed against the condensing elements. The upper outlet roller with a Shore hardness of less than 60° is very soft, whereby a good guidance of the fibres results between the upper outlet roller and the condensing element, which is preferably being provided in form of a perforated suction drum.<br>
Such a structure has very positive effects on the drawing and the succeeding condensing of the fibres. With a profiled outer surface on the condensing element, in particular with a fluted structure, the control of the drawn fibres and the fibres to be compressed can thus be improved.<br>
In the following the invention is being described in more detail by way of the accompanying drawing.<br><br>
The drafting unit comprises preferably a first roller 23 with a first counter roller 13, between which the roving 22 enters the pre-drawing zone of the drafting unit. Then the roving 22 passes through the main drawing zone within which the roving 22 is being guided between an upper tape 15 and a lower tape 33 on a second counter roller 14 or on a second cylinder 34 respectively. The drawing procedure is finished when the roving passes between an upper outlet roller 16 and a condensing element 35. This condensing element is preferably provided in form of a suction drum with a perforation. The condensing zone of the drawn roving 22 lays between the clamping gaps, on one hand, of the upper outlet roller 16 with the condensing element 35 and a further clamping roller 36 with the condensing element 35. Thereafter the yarn, which receives a twist after leaving the clamping gap between the clamping roller 36 and the condensing element 35, is being wound onto a yarn carrier.<br>
According to the invention one of the rollers being pressed against the condensing element, in particular the upper outlet roller 16, is being provided with a layer which at least at its inside possesses a hardness of clearly less than 60° Shore. The outer surface of the upper outlet roller 16 has an abrasion-resistant layer. The upper outlet roller 16 can also be furnished with a two-component layer which is very soft at its inside, that is less than 60° Shore and which on the outside has an abrasion-resitant running surface layer. In order to securely guide the fibres in the clamping gap between the upper outlet roller 16 and the condensing element 35 the condensing element requires a defined roughness, for examples as is being described in the above mentioned DE 19 917 1818.5.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
WE CLAIM :<br>
1.	Spinning frame with a condensing device combined with a drafting unit, characterized in that within the zone of the roving which is being condensed, a upper outlet roller (16) with a surface hardness of less than 60° Shore is being pressed against a condensing element (35), the condensing element (35) is designed as a basically rigid element and the upper outlet roller (16) is being furnished with a layer of material which at least partly comprises a hardness of distinctly less than 60°, the upper outlet roller (16) is being provided with an abrasion-resistant outer layer.<br>
2.	Spinning frame according to claim 1, wherein the upper outlet roller (16) is being provided with a two-component layer, having an inner hardness of less than 60° Shore, being very soft, and an outer layer with an abrasion resistant ruiming surface.<br>
3.	Spinning frame according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the condensing element (35) has a roughness.<br>
4.	Spinning frame according to one of the preceding claims, wherein the condensing element (35) is being provided with a fluted surface structure.<br>
5.	Spinning frame according to one of the preceding claims, wherein the condensing element (35) is a perforated suction drum, particularly a circular-cylindric drum with suction air being applied from its inside.<br>
6.	Spinning frame according to one of the claims 1 to 4, wherein the condensing<br><br>
element consists of a hollow body with suction air being applied from its inside, said body being provided with a slot and an air penetratable tape being led over it.<br>
7. Spinning frame according to one of the preceding claims, wherein the condensing element (35) and the upper outlet roller (16) form the outlet roller pair of the drafting unit.<br><br></td>
