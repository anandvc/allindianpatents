BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to acrylate copolymer blends and in particular to ethylene methylacrylate copolymer/ethylene buty-lacrylate copolymer blends and their use as a layer or interlayer which is bonded to mineral (e.g., glass) or polymer substrates for the manufacture of bilayer or multiple layer laminates. In particular, these films are useful between two or more transparent layers made of glass or polymer materials for use as safety glass for automotive and architectural applications.<br>
Technology Review<br>
For over three decades significant efforts have been made to find an. interlayer film which performs as well as polyvdnylbutyral (PVB) without its inherent drawbacks. A number of polymers and formulations based on them have been used to produce transparent interlayer films for bilayer and multiple layer mineral (e.g., glass) or polymer sheets, particularly for flat glass products in automotive and architectural safety glass applications. The major glass laminate manufacturers for the most part have still found that for their cost polyvinylbutyral (PVB) compositions provide the best overall performance and therefore these have been the interlays^ of choice for laminated glass appTicatibhs.<br>
The performance of the interlayer films is based on film characteristics such as tensile strength., elongation at break, softening point and glass adhesion strength and laminate properties  such  as  luminous  transmittance,  boil  test<br><br>
stability, humidity test stability,	light stability and impact<br>
and  penetration  resistance.	While  conventional  PVB<br>
interlayers  perform well,  they	do  suffer  from several<br>
drawbacks.<br>
The major drawback of PVB is its moisture sensitivity. This-s is- -important because during storage and use under what would be considered typical conditions in a flat glass manufacturing environment there is the potential for significant increases in moisture content. The increased moisture in interlayer films results in increased haze and may cause bubble formation in the final laminated flat glass products which is unacceptable to both the manufacturers and their customers. Therefore, special precautions have to be taken to keep the moisture content of the PVB film and ulitmately the haze of the laminated flat glass products to an optimum. These special precautions may include reducing storage times of the PVB film to a minimum, refrigeration of the PVB-_filnL_prior, to lamination, pre-drying of the PVB film and/or the use of dehumidifiers in the "clean rooms used for preparing the laminates. This both increases the cost and the difficulty in manufacturing laminates made with a polyvinyl butyral interlayer. Even then when the edges of the laminated glass are exposed to moisture, haze will develop.<br>
Another drawback of PVB is the need for a plasticizer in film for bonding the PVB to the glass. The plasticizer tends to migrate over time leading to changes in the properties of-the laminate and in particular delamination will begin to occur at the edges of the laminated glass due to loss of the plasticizer.<br>
The other polymers and formulations which have been used<br><br>
or  tried  include  those  based  on  polyurethane  (PU) ,<br>
polyvinylchloride  (PVC),  ethylene  copolymers  such  as<br>
ethylenevinylacetate  (EVA), polymeric fat acid polyamide<br>
(PAM), polyester resins such as polyethyleneterephtalate<br>
(PET),  silicone elastomers  (SEL),  epoxy resins  (ER)  or<br>
polycarbonates such as elastomeric polycarbonates (PC and<br>
EPC)-.  While many of these polymers and formulations do not<br>
have as relatively significant a moisture absorption problem<br>
as PVB, they do lack the overall performance of the PVB films<br>
at comparable costs.  Further, some of these polymers and<br>
formulations require enhanced processing such as irradiation<br>
or the use of additional chemical components such as<br>
plasticizers which affect the cost and properties of the film<br>
and the flat glass products made using the film. For example,<br>
plasticizers will tend to migrate over time further affecting<br>
the properties of both the film and the products made using<br>
the film.<br>
An object of this invention is to grouse a polymer 1m Which has a tensile strength, moisture absorption, elongation at break, softening point and a glass adhesion strength which are comparible or superior to PVB, and which can be incorporated in laminated glass products such as windshield and architectural safety glass that have a luminous transmittance, boil test stability, humidity test stability, light stability and impact and penetration resistance comparible or superior to those made with PVB.<br>
A further object of this invention is to produce an ethylene acrylate copolymer blend and film which is useful as a component of optical laminates.<br>
A further object of this invention is to produce an<br><br>
Deceit<br>
ethylene aerials copolymer blend and film which can be processed into an interlayer under conditions similar to those used for processing PVB.<br>

Blends using an additive package comprised 100 parts by weight acrylate blend along with 0.3 parts by weight of vinyltriethoxysilane as a coupling agent, 1 part by weight of dicumyl peroxide as a crosslinking agent sold under the tradename  of  Luprasol  101  from  ElfAtochem  Company, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and 1 part by weight of a polyol acetal as a clarifying agent sold under the tradename Millad 3 94 0 and manufactured by Milliken Chemicals of Spartanburg, .._ South. Caroling. All formulations were premixed in a dry high speed XturJjQi^mixer at^ 300 rpm^ f or 3a minutes, then blended and extruded in a twin-screw extruder (Model "zsk-3 0 made by Werner and Pfleider Co. of Ramsey, New Jersey into strings. The strings were then cut into pellets of a standard size. The extruder had a temperature at the barrel entrance of 13 2-140 °C, and a die temperature of 196 °C.<br>
The extruded pellets were processed into films using a cast film line consisting of a single screw extruder Model No. 20IN20 made by Davis Standard of Pawcatuck, Connecticut. The screw of the extruder had a diameter of 50.8 mm and a relative barrel length of 24 diameters. The extruder was equiped with a flat extrusion die having ar. orifice which was 45.72 cm wide.  Films of two thicknesses 0.18 mm and 0.3 6 mm were<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The barrel of the extruder was divided into six heating zones progressively increasing the temperature of the blend up to the die.  The barrel temperature was maintained in each of zones 1-6 at ISO, 190, 200, 200, 200 and 210 °C, respectively.  The temperature of the extrusion die was maintained at approximately 200 °C.  The pressure to which the blend was subjected was measured for both the 0.18 and 0.3 6 mm thick films.  The pressure at the end of the screw ' was 1390 and 1260 psi, respectively, and in the die was 815 and 770 psi, respectively.  The speed of the screw was maintained at between 10-14 rpm for 0.18 mm thick films and 16-21 rpm for 0.3 6 mm thick films.<br><br>
Each film was extruded and cooled using a three roll casting roll stock and was wound on to 7.6 cm cores. Fifteen samples were cut for testing from each film produced.  At each of five sampling locations which were 20 linear feet apart, samples were obtained at three points across the film (from each of the edges and from the middle) .- -<br>
Example 2<br>
Film samples produced according to Example 1 from EMAC, EBAC and combinations of EMAC and EBAC were tested for water content after storage, softening point, tensile strength, elongation at break, tear strength, transmittance and haze, and compared with the properties of polyvinyl butyral film (PVB) sold under the tradename Saflex SR 41 manufactured by Monsanto of St. Louis, Missouri, and ethylene-vinyl acetate<br>

. — £!£,,Atoehem/ Philadelphia, Pennsylvania which are used worldwide as interlayers in safety glass manufacturing ^~ (These films were used as controls due to the extensive us&gt; of PVB and EVA in the flat glass industry for making safety glass) .  The average results for each film sample and their commercial counterparts are shown in Table II.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The test for water content after storage was performed by measuring the change in weight of the sample before and after exposing a sample of film to 50% relative humidity at 20 °C for 14 days.  The softening point was measured on a DSC using a heating at a rate of 2.5 °C per minute.  The elongation on~brea]c and tensrile~strength ^ras determined 4»y usxng ^SSTff TJ-^^JB tesirtng- metho^r^The ^fcesfc---^or---*ear sfcrea^h was performed using ASTM D-882 testing method.  The transmission and the haze were measured after laminating 0.4 mm film between two layers of 3 mm thick sheets of clear, soda-lime-silicate glass.  The transmission was measured using ANSI Standard Z2 6.1T2.  The haze was measured using German Standard DIN R43-A.3/4.<br>
The results of the films made from 100% EBAC resin show that EBAC films containing 8-16 percent by weight of butyl acrylate groups have a relatively low transparency and high haze.  The results indicate that as the amount of acrylate groups in the film increase from 16 to 26 percent by weight<br><br>
M-*2099<br>
this leads to a significant improvement in the optical properties of the EBAC film with the best optical properties being found when the amount of aery late in the film is between 18 and 22 percent by weight.  While the transparency and haze of these films improve, the improvement is not enough to consider using these films as a substitute for PVB or EVA as" a glass inter layer.<br>
The results further show that EBAC films have excellent mechanical properties which appear to be superior to PVB, EVA and EMAC films.  The brittleness at low temperatures is independent of the molecular weight (melt flow rate) and acrylate content, however, the tensile strength, elongation on break and tear resistance are optimal when the melt flow rate of the EBAC is between 0.5 and 6.0 grams/10 minutes and these properties decrease when the melt flow rate of the EBAC exceeds 6.0 grams/10 minutes.<br>
,_ I_ The results show that films made Iruju 100% EMA^ resin:: with acrylate content of 8 to 42 percent by weight are more transparent and have a lower haze than EBAC films. The optimal optical properties of EMAC occur when the acrylate content of the film is between 22 to 27 percent by weight. The results further show that while the mechanical properties of these films do not compare with those of the EBAC film that the mechanical properties can be optimized by using resin with a melt flow rate in the range of 0.5 to 20.0 grams/id minutes, and can be further opt liaised "by using" resin with a melt flow rate in the range of 2.0 to 6.0 grams/10 minutes.<br>
The results show that films made from combinations of EMAC and EBAC films can combine both the excellent optical<br><br>
M 2090<br>
and bonding properties of the EMAC with the excellent mechanical properties and thermal properties of the EBAC. These combinations in particular give superior properties when the ethylene butyl acrylate copolymer (EBAC) is from about 20 percent to about 5 percent by weight of the combination of ethylene butyl acrylate/ethylene methyl acrylate' and the ethylene methyl acrylate (EMAC) is from about 80 percent to about 95 percent by weight of the combination of ethylene butyl acrylate/ethylene methyl acrylate, the EBAC has an acrylate content of 18 to 22 percent by weight and a melt flow rate of 0.5 to 6.0 grams/10 minutes, and the EMAC has an acrylate content of 20 to 27 percent by weight and a melt flow rate of 2.0 to 6.0 grams/10 minutes.<br>
Example 3<br>
Film samples produced according- to Example 1 from EMAC, EBAC and combinations of EMAC and EBAC were used to manufacture a number of samples of laminates.  These samples were produced using Saint Gobains "pilot technology" to simulate the manufacturing technology.  Clear soda-lime-silicate glass sheets of 3 mm thickness and dimensions of 50 x 50 cm were cleaned using acetone to remove dust, grease and other contaminations from the glass surface.  Prior to this the PVB for the control samples was dried for several hours to reduce the moisture content to 0.5 % by weight or lower, and was used for lamination immediately - after-this ■-operation.  The other films investigated in this disclosure did not require a drying step before lamination.<br>
For laminating, a piece of film was cut to obtain a sample which is 50 x 50 cm.  This sample was then put onto<br><br>
the surface of the bottom glass sheet and pressed onto the glass sheet using a rubber roll.  Another glass sheet was placed on top of the film obtaining a "sandwich" structure which is then clamped.  This "sandwich" was then placed in an autoclave and heated to a temperature of between 110-115 °C while drawing a vacuum of 3-5 x 10"2 mm of Hg.  This melts the-film- -surfaces while eliminating air between the layers. The "sandwich" structure was held in the autoclave under these conditions for 3 hours during which time a safety glass laminate was produced.<br>
The glass/film (interlayer)/glass laminates were peel tested, boil tested, humidity tested, light stability tested and penetration tested, and compared with the properties of polyvinyl butyral film (PVB) sold under the registered trademark Saflex SR 41 manufactured by Monsanto of St. Louis, Missouri, and ethylene-vinyl acetate film (EVA) sold ^dander J^estradjenaps^ EVA Pgljt BD 3 00 manufactured by Elf ^^^ocliea^^Ehiladelghia, PennsylyaniaP^^ich aye used worldwide. as interlayers in safety glass manufacturing.  The average results for each laminate and their commercial counterparts are shown in Table III.<br><br><br><br>

The humidity test was performed by exposing the laminate to 100% relative humidity at 50 °C for 14 days and then examining the laminate visually for any signs of haze.

The boJUL test ^stability jtsts  d^termi^ed ^yjbqiliiig^ajsample pf^ the laminate in water for 2 hours'at 100 °C and then visually examining the sample for haze.  The light stability test was performed by aging a sample of the laminate with a UV-Bulb #5 using an intensity of 0.5 watts/m2 for 100 hours and then examining the laminate for any visual changes. The pentration test was performed using the German Standard DIN 52338 which is similar to the U.S. ball drop standard.  This is a pass-fail type of test.  According to this method a 50 x 50 cm sample of the laminate is cut from a safety glass sheet.  The laminate was placed on a solid metered concrete substrate. A ball of 2,260 grams is used.  The laminate passes if no penetration occurs while it is considered a failure if the ball is able to penetrate the laminate.  The tests start with<br><br>
the smallest height of drop of the ball of 1.5 m, then if positive results are obtained, the test is repeated by increasing to the height of 2.0 m and dropping the ball on a similar new specimen, and if no failure the test is repeated increasing the height of the drop to 2.5 m. If positive results are achieved at the last height the safety glass is considered to have passed the penetration test.<br>
The results indicated that the EMAC and EMAC/EBAC film blends are equivalent or superior to films and laminates produced from the known PVB and EVA based formulations. These films have the further advantage in laminating of not needing plastisizers, having a low water content after storage thereby eliminating the need for humidity control during manufacturing, having a very high thermal stability, are non-corrosive (i.e., do not need specialized equipment for manufacturing), and are bondable to glass without the use of bonding- -agents.<br>
