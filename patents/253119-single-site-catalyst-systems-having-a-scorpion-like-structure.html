				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention related to the field of single site catalyst systems having<br>
scorpion-like three dimensional structure that are suitable for oligomerising or<br>
polymerising ethylene and alpha-olefins. <br>
There exists a multitude of catalyst systems available for polymerising or<br>
oligomerising ethylene and alpha-olefins, but there is a growing need for finding new<br>
systems capable to tailor polymers with very specific properties. More and more post-<br>
metaliocene catalyst components based on early or late transition metals from<br>
Groups 3 to 10 of the Periodic Table have recently been investigated such as for<br>
example those disclosed in Gibson and al. review (Gibson, V.C.; Spitzmesser, S.K.,<br>
Chem. Rev. 2003, 103, p. 283). But there is still a need to improve either the<br>
specificities or the performances of these systems.<br>
It is an aim of the present invention to provide a new single site catalyst components<br>
based on beta-diimine ligands with a chelating pendant arm.<br>
It is also an aim of the present invention to provide single site catalyst components<br>
having a scorpion-like spatial organisation.<br>
It is another aim of the present invention to provide active catalyst systems based on<br>
these catalyst components.<br>
It is a further aim of the present invention to provide a process for polymerising or for<br>
oligomerising ethylene and alpha-olefins with these new catalyst systems.<br>
It is also an aim of the present invention to provide a polyethylene by polymerising<br>
ethylene with these new catalyst systems.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention discloses a ligand of formula I<br><br><br>
wherein R1, R2, R3, R4, R5. R6, R7, R8, R9 and R10 are each independently<br>
selected from hydrogen, unsubstituted or substituted hydrocarbyl, or inert functional<br>
group. Two or more of those the groups can themselves be linked together to form<br>
further ring or rings.<br>
R1 and R3, R2 and R4, and R9 and R10, cannot be simultaneously oxazoline<br>
wherein Z is selected from groups 15 or 16 of the Periodic Table and m is the<br>
valence pf Z minus one.<br>
By inert functional group, is meant a group, other than hydrocarbyl or substituted<br>
hydrocarbyl, that is inert under the complexation conditions to which the compound<br>
containing said group is subjected. They can be selected for example from halo,<br>
ester, ether, amino, imino, nitro, cyano, carboxyl, phosphate, phosphonite,<br>
phosphine, phosphinite, thioether and amide. Preferably, they are selected from halo,<br>
such as chloro, bromo, fiuoro and iodo, or ether of formula - OR* wherin R* is<br>
unsubstituted or substituted hydrocarbyl. After metallation of the ligand, an inert<br>
functional group must not coordinate to the metal more strongly than the groups<br>
organised to coordinate to the metal and thereby displace the desired coordinating<br>
group.<br><br>
It results from the reaction between a beta-diimine II and a compound of formula III<br>
wherein X is a leaving group, preferably halogen for example Br.<br><br>
Preferably, R1 and R2 are the same or different and are unsubstituted or substituted<br>
alkyl groups, unsubstituted or substituted aryl groups, or unsubstituted or substituted<br>
cycloalkyl groups, more preferably, they are unsubstituted or substituted phenyl<br>
groups and if they are substituted, the substituents may be joined to form a closed<br>
structure. If the phenyls are substituted, the substituents preferably occupy 2 and 6<br>
positions.<br>
Preferably, R3 and R4 are the same or different, hydrogen, unsubstituted or<br>
substituted alkyl groups, unsubstituted or substituted aryl groups, or unsubstituted or<br>
substituted cycloalkyl groups, more preferably, they are unsubstituted or substituted<br>
alkyl groups. Optionally R3 and R4 may also be linked together to form a cyclohexyl<br>
ring.<br>
In another embodiment according to the present invention, R1 with R3 or R2 with R4<br>
are linked together to form a ring.<br>
Preferably, R5 is hydrogen, unsubstituted or substituted alkyl groups, unsubstituted<br>
or substituted aryl groups, more preferably hydrogen or methyl.<br>
Preferably, Z is selected from N, P, O or S.<br>
Preferably, R6, R7, R8, R9 and R10 are the same or different, hydrogen,<br>
unsubstituted or substituted alkyl groups, unsubstituted or substituted aryl groups, or<br>
unsubstituted or substituted cycloalkyl groups. R8, R9 and R10 can be linked<br><br>
together to form a ring, for example a pyridine, a quinoline, an isoquinoline, a pyrrolyl,<br>
a furyl or a thiophenyl group.<br>
Examples of formula III include 2-(bromomethyl)-5-nitrofuran, 2-(bromomethyl)-1,3-<br>
dioxalane,	2-(bromomethyl)tetrahydro-2H-pyran,	2-(bromomethyl)-5-<br>
trifluoromethyl)furan, 3(-bramomethyl)pyridazine, 2-bromomethylpyridine, 1 -bromo-<br>

resulting from the complexation of ligand I with the metallic salt MX'n in a solvent,<br>
wherein M is a metal Group 3 to 10 of the periodic Table, X' is the same or different<br>

Preferably, M is Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Pd or rare earths. More preferably, it<br>
is Cr or Fe.<br>
The metal is complexed with the two nitrogen atoms of the starting beta-diimine and<br>
during the complexation reaction, the complex folds around the carbon atom joining<br>
atom Z to the metal to form a three dimensional scorpion-like structure.<br><br>
The solvent may be selected from dichloromethane or tetrahydrofuran and the<br>
complexation reaction is carried out at room temperature.<br>
The present invention also discloses an active catalyst system comprising the single<br>
site catalyst component of formula IV and an activating agent having an ionising<br>
action.<br>
Suitable activating agents are well known in the art. The activating agent can be an<br>

The amount of activating agent is selected to give an Al/M ratio of from 100 to 3000,<br>
preferably of from 500 to 2000. The amount of activating agent depends upon its<br>
nature, the preferred Al/M ratio being of about 2000.<br>
Suitable boron-containing activating agents may comprise a triphenylcarbenium<br>
boronate such as tetrakis-pentafluorophenyl-borato-triphenylcarbenium as described<br>
in EP-A-0427696, or those of the general formula [L'-H] + [B Ar1 Ar2 X3 X4]- as<br>
described in EP-A-0277004 (page 6, line 30 to page 7, line 7).<br>
The amount of boron-containing activating agent is selected to give a B/M ratio of<br>
from 0.5 to 5, preferably of about 1,<br>
In another embodiment, according to the present invention, the single site catalyst<br>
component of formula IV may be deposited on a conventional support. Preferably,<br>

The active catalyst system is used in the oligomerisation and in the polymerisation of<br>
ethylene and alpha-olefins.<br>
The present invention discloses a method for the oligomerisation or the homo- or co-<br>
polymerisation of ethylene and alpha-olefins that comprises the steps of:<br>
a)	injecting the active catalyst system into the reactor; <br>
b)	injecting the monomer and optional comonomer either before or after or<br>
simultaneously with step a); <br>
c)	maintaining under polymerisation conditions;<br>
d)	retrieving the oligomers and/or polymer.<br>
The pressure in the reactor can vary from 0.5 to 50 bars, preferably from 5 to 25<br>
bars.<br>
The polymerisation temperature can range from 10 to 100°C, preferably from 50 to<br>

The preferred monomer and optional comonomer can be selected from ethylene,<br>
propylene or 1-hexene. Alternatively, the optional comonomer can be a polar<br>
functionalised alpha-olefin. <br>
With a catalyst activated by MAO, the polymer formed is caracterized by a melting<br>
point comprised between 100 and 135 °C, preferably between 125 and 131 °C as<br>
measured by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) method. It has a multimodal<br>
molecular weight distribution with a molecular weight Mw of from 50000 to 500000,<br>
preferably of from 75000 to 250000, and a molecular weight distribution of 15 to 50<br>
depending on the solvent. The molecular weight distribution is measured by the<br>
polydispersity index D defined as the ratio Mw/Mn of the weight average molecular<br>
weight Mw over the number average molecular weight Mn. Molecular weights are<br>
measured by Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC).<br>
With a catalyst activated by IBAO, the polymer formed is characterised by a melting<br>
point of about 135 °C as measured by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)<br><br>
method. It has a broad monomodal molecular weight distribution with a molecular<br>
weight Mw of 765000, and a molecular weight distribution of 25. The molecular<br>
weight distribution is measured by the polydispersity index D defined as the ratio<br>
Mw/Mn of the weight average molecular weight Mw over the number average<br>
molecular weight Mn. Molecular weights are measured by Gel Permeation<br>
Chromatography (GPC). 13C NMR analysis showed the presence of linear (12 per<br>
10000 carbon atoms) and isobutyle (10 per 10000 C atoms) saturated end chains,.<br>
No short chain branching were detected.<br>
With a supported catalyst, the polymer formed has a monomodal molecular weight<br>
distribution with a molecular weight Mw of from 150000 to 350000, preferably of from<br>
180000 to 280000, and a molecular weight distribution of 5 to 20. it has a melting<br>
point comprised between 125 and 135 °C. It has no short chain branching detectable<br>
by 13C NMR analysis but it has long chain branching. The presence of the long chain<br>
branching is indicated by RDA analysis.<br>
Throughout this description, LCB means chains long enough for entanglements to<br>
occur.<br>
In order to quantify LCB concentration with rheology, we have adapted Shroff and<br>
Mavridis definition of LCBI (Long Chain Branching Index) to our high molecular<br>
weight PE samples. (R. N. Shroff and H. Mavridis, Macromolecules, 32,8454,1999.)<br>
As explained by those authors, LCBI quantifies the Theological effect of LCB<br>
(enhancement of shear viscosity at low shear rates) for narrow and broad molecular<br>
weight distribution (MWD) samples with sparse amount of LCB, that is LCB<br>
concentration typically too low to be detected by 13C NMR (for homopolymers PE) or<br>
by solution techniques such as size exclusion chromatography (SEC) coupled with<br>
on-line viscosity or light scattering detectors. DRI (Dow Rheology Index) which is<br>
another LCB indicator described in lai et al. (S. Lai, T. A. Plumley, T. I. Butler, G. W.<br>
Knight, C. I. Kao, SPE AntecTechn. Papers, 40,1814,1994) is not suitable to<br>
quantify LCB in polyethylene resins with polydispersity index larger than 4. DRI is<br>
thus not suitable to gauge LCB in our PE resins with broad MWD.<br><br>
According to those authors, LCBI is defined as the ratio of intrinsic viscosities of PE<br>
resins estimated by rheoiogy to that determined via solution techniques.<br><br>
wherein [nlrheo and [n]sol are the intrinsic viscosities obtained respectively from<br>
rheoiogy or via solution. <br>
Thus, LCBI is zero for linear samples and is above zero for polyethylene containing<br>
long chain branching. A high level of LCB is encountered with LCBI above 0.8.<br>
Instead of determining intrinsic viscosity from the relative viscosity at 0.2 dg/min as<br>
explained in their publication, we calculate intrinsic viscosity value via solution<br>
(expressed in dl/g) in terms of weight average molecular weight Mw (expressed in<br>
Da) obtained by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) with equation<br><br>
Zero shear viscosity (η0) (expressed in Pa.s) is also related to Mw (expressed in Da)<br>
by equation<br><br>
Zero shear viscosity is estimated by fitting with Carreau-Yasuda flow curve at 190°C,<br>
obtained by oscillatory shear rheoiogy on ARES equipment in the linear<br>
viscoelasticiiy domain. Circular frequency (W in rad/s) varies from 0.05-0.1 rad/s to<br>
250-500 rad/s and the shear strain is typically 10 %.<br>
The intrinsic viscosity inferred from rheoiogy can thus be expressed as<br><br>
wherein x, b and n are fitting parameters called relaxation time, breadth parameter<br>
and power-law parameter, respectively.<br><br>
The LCBl is thus rewritten as<br><br>
In order to increase the accuracy in estimating zero shear viscosity, a frequency<br>
sweep experiment having a typical range of 0.1-250 rad/s, is combined with a creep<br>
experiment, in order to extend the frequency range to values down to 10-4 s-1 or<br>
lower, and taking the usual assumption of equivalence of angular frequency (rad/s)<br>
and shear rate.<br>
Frequency sweep experiments are performed using small parallel plates having a<br>
diameter of 8 mm that allow flow curve determination with as little as 0.1 g PE. Also,<br>
most tests are conducted at a temperature of 2309C for polymers that do not exhibit<br>
homogeneous flow below that temperature.<br>
Thus, LCBl is derived at a temperature of 230°C using extrapolated shear viscosity at<br>
0.001 s"1 as follows.<br><br>
The subscript 230 recalls that LCBl is determined from frequency sweep experiments<br>
conducted at 230°C.<br>
The relationship between viscosity and Mw is established as usual with a series of<br>
linear polyethylene. The viscosity/Mw relationship was established with a series of 15<br>
linear PE having a polydispersity index betxeen 2 and 18.<br>
ZN or metallocene-produced polyethylene known to be linear have a LCBl of 0 +/<br>
0.1. Thus, PE with LCB are detected above LCBl of 0.1-0.2<br><br><br>

Preparation of catalyst component<br>
Synthesis of the liaand 1.<br>
Step l.<br>
The beta-diimine was synthesised according to the published procedure of Feldman<br>
and al. (Organometallics 1997,16, p. 1514).<br>
Step 2.<br>
760 mg (3 mmol) of 2-bromomethylpyridine.HBr and 436 mg (3.15 mmbl) of<br>
potassium carbonate weredegassed under vacuum for 1 hour. 10 mL of dry acetone<br>
were added and the mixture was stirred under argon for 6 hours at room temperature<br>
(about 25 °C). The solvent was removed and the 2-bromomethylpyridine was<br>
extracted with 3 x 10 mL of diethyl ether under inert atmosphere. The solvent was<br>
removed to afford a pink oil with quantitative yield.<br>
Step 3.<br>
1.26 g (3 mmol) of beta-diimine were dissolved in 15 mL of dry THF under argon. The<br>
solution was cooled to a temperature of -20°C and 2 mL (3.15 mmol) of n-BuLi (1.6<br>
M in hexane) were added dropwise. The colourless solution turned immediately to<br>
bright yellow and was stirred at room temperature for 30 minutes. The solution was<br>
cooled to a temperature of -20°C and a solution of 2-bromomethylpyridine in 10 mL<br>
of dry THF was added by canula. The solution was allowed to warm to room<br><br>
temperature and was stirred overnight, before being heated at 80°C for 6 hours<br>
under reflux. After that time, the solvent was evaporated to dryness. The residue was<br>
taken with 10 mL of dichloromethane and filtered over neutral alumina. The solution<br>
was evaporated to afford a yellow oil purified by column chromatography (SiO2,<br>
pentane:diethyl ether 95:5 to 80:20). 910 mg of the expected product were obtained<br>
as pale yellow oil containing isomers 1a and 1b, with a yield of 60 %.<br><br>

High pressure polymerisation of ethylene.<br>
Ethylene polymerisation reactions were performed in a 20 mL stainless steel<br>
autoclave containing a glass insert, fitted with mechanical stirring, external<br>
thermocouple and pressure gauge and controlled by computer. In a typical reaction<br>
run, 4 mL of dry solvent (toluene or n-heptane) were introduced into the reactor, the<br>
temperature was raised to 50 oC and the ethylene pressure was raised to 15 bar and<br>
continuously fed. In a argon-filled glove box, about 5 umol of the appropriate catalyst<br>
were weighted, activated with an amount of methylaluminoxane (MAO 30 % wt in<br>
toluene) or tetraisobutyldialuminoxane (IBAO 10 wt % in toluene) activator in an<br>
amount appropriate to obtain a ratio [Al]:[M3 of 2000 and diluted with toluene to a final<br>
volume of 2 mL. 200 µL of the solution of the activated catalyst were placed inside<br>
the reactor. The injection loop was rinsed with 800 uL of solvent. After 1 hour or a<br>
consumption of 12 mmol of ethylene, the reaction was quenched with isopropanol<br>
and an aliquot analysed by gas chromatography. The gas chromatographic analysis<br>
of the reaction products were performed on a Trace GC apparatus with a Petrocol<br>
capillary column (methyl silicone, 100 m long, i.d. 0.25 mm and film thickness of 0.5<br>
urn) working at a temperature of 35°C for 15 min and then heated to a temperature of<br>
250 °C at a heating rate of 5sC/min. The remaining reaction mixture was quenched<br>
with MeOH / HCI and the polymer was filtered, washed with methanol and dried at a<br>
temperature of 50°C, under vacuum, for a period of time of 24 hours.<br>
The reaction conditions for each example are displayed in Table I and the results are<br>
displayed in Table II and in Table III.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Oligomerisation of 1-haxene.<br>
In a argon-filled glove box, about 7.5 µmol of the appropriate catalyst were weighted,<br>
activated with an amount of methylaluminoxsne (MAO) activator, 30 % wt in toluene,<br>
suitable to give a [AI]:[M] ratio of 2000 and diluted with toluene to a final volume of<br>
4.5 mL 3 mL of the solution of the activated catalyst were placed in a Schlenk tube<br>
containing 5 mL of 1-hexene. The solution was stirred at a temperature of 30°C for 1<br>
hour. The mixture was quenched with slightly acidified methanol. The layers were<br>
separated. The toluene layer was concentrated to dryness to afford oligomers. The<br>
gas chromatographic analysis of the reaction products was done on a Trace GC<br>
apparatus with a Petrocol capillary column (methyl silicone, 100 m long, i.d. 0.25 mm<br>
and film thickness of 0.5 µm) working at a temperature of 100°C for 4 min and then<br>
heated to a temperature of 250 °C at a heating rate of 8°C/min.<br>
The results are displayed in Table IV.<br><br><br>
Ethylene polymerisation reactions were carried out in a 130 ml stainless steel<br>
autoclave equipped with mechanical stirring and a stainless steel injection cylinder. In<br>
a typical reaction run, the reactor was first dried under nitrogen flow at 100PC during<br>
10 min. Then it was cooled down to the reaction temperature (50° or 85°C) and 35 ml<br>
of isobutane were introduced into the reactor with a syringe pump, followed by the<br>
comonomer if required. The pressure was adjusted to the desired value (14.8 or 23.8<br>
bar) with ethylene. In an argon-filled glove box, 300 mg of the supported catalyst<br>
(complex 3 deposited on MAO impregnated silica, at 2 wt % based on the total<br>
weight of the supported catalyst), the cocatalyst and 0.6 ml of n-hexane were placed<br>
into the injection cylinder. The valve was closed and the cylinder was connected to<br>
the reactor under nitrogen flow. The active catalyst mixture was then introduced into<br>
the reactor with 40 ml of isobutane. After 30 minutes or 1 hour, the reactor was<br>
cooled down to room temperature and slowly depressurised, and the polymer was<br>
recovered. The polymerisation results are displayed in Table V.<br><br><br>
The obtained polymers were characterized by GPC in TCB at 140°C, by DSC, by<br>
RDA at 230°C and by 13C NMR in TCB at 135°C. The results are displayed in table<br>
VI and figure 2.<br><br>
The 13C NMR analysis for examples 10 and 12, showed the absence of short<br>
chain branching (less than 0.1 mol%) and the presence of saturated and vinylic ends.<br>
It can thus be seen that the polymers according to the present invention have a very<br>
high level of long chain branching, in fact much larger than the polymers prepared<br>
with bis-tetrahydroindenyl metallocene catalyst components known to have a high<br>
level of high chain branching and who exhibit a LCBI typically of from 0.5 to 1.<br><br>
