The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br>
3<br>
1<br><br>
The present invention relates to a transmucosal drug delivery system and its preparation for Benzimidazole class of proton pump inhibitors.<br>
In the present invention, transmucosal drug delivery system is prepared using uncoated Benzimidazole proton pump inhibitors. The said transmucosal system or tablet is prepared using proton pump inhibitors of Benzimidazole class.<br>
The objective of the invention is to absorb the oral transmucosal dosage form in mouth cavity. The routes of administration of the said transmucosal drug are sublingual   buccal, gingival. The administration of dosage form containing Benzimidazole class of proton pump inhibitors, suppresses gastric acid secretion at the secretory surface of gastric parietal cells.<br>
Background of the inventions:<br>
Benzimidazole class of PPI, that inhibits gastric acid secretion are typically available as enteric coated tablets, pellets or granules or orally disintegrating tablet consisting of enteric coated drug.<br>
The use of enteric coating of the drug is essential as this class of drugs is prone to acid degradation. Manufacturing process for enteric coated pellets or tablets is cumbersome process. Also, the absorption and thereby onset of action of the drug is delayed. There is also food effect in the<br>
2<br><br>
absorption of the drug. The drugs also undergo extensive hepatic first pass metabolism.<br>
For acute and chronic cases of gastric ulcer, duodenal ulcers, GERD, severe erosive oesphagitis and other pathological hypersecretory conditions such as Zollinger Ellison syndrome, a fast acting dosage form is the purpose of the invention.<br>
US patent 6,498,171 claims a pharmaceutical composition of hydroxyomeprazole and their salts in tablet or capsule oral dosage form for the treatment of ulcers of stomach, duodenum and esophagus, gastroesophageal reflux disease, Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome, psoriasis. The active pharmaceutical substance hydroxyomeprazole or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, is preferably used about 100-500 mg of the total weight of the Tablet or capsule. Due to acid instability of hydroxyomeprazole, sustain release enteric coated tablet or capsule is prepared.<br>
US patent 6,328,993 claims for a novel oral administration form for plurality of acid-labile uncoated individual active compound units. Where in the active compound is surrounded by a mixture of at least one sterol and at least one polymer, by at least one fatty alcohol or by a mixture of at least one fatty alcohol and at least one polymer and/or at least one sterol. Acid labile proton pump inhibitors of Benzimidazole are active compound units used in the invention.<br>
3<br><br>
US patent 6,365,184 describes the oral, multiple unit tableted dosage form comprising an anti-ulcer drug, preferably an acid susceptible proton pump inhibitor in the form of individually enteric coating layered units, together with one or more NSAIDs (nonsteroidal antiinflamatory drugs) and tablet excipients. / US patent 6,296,876 claims on an enteric coated oral dosage form of a selected acid labile compound, in particular proton pump inhibitor compounds which decrease production of acid in the gut. The novel pharmaceutical composition comprises about 1 to 75% by weight an acid labile compound, acid sequestering compound(s), upto about 5% by weight disintegrant and at least one coating layer.<br>
US patent 6,489,346 covers substituted Benzimidazole dosage forms and methods of using same. Wherein solid pharmaceutical composition, a dosage form is prepared including non-enteric coated (uncoated) proton pump inhibitor approximately 5mg to 300 mg and with the use of excess of buffering agents in the range of approximately 0.1 m.Eq to 2.5 m.Eq per mg of PPI. Wherein the dosage form is selected from the group consisting of suspension tablet, chewable tablet, effervescent powder and effervescent tablet.<br>
US patent 6,303,147 describe on a bioadhesive pharmaceutical composition comprising a pharmaceutically effective amount of an active ingredient, from 80% to 98.8% w/w pre-gelatinzed starch, from 1% to 10%<br>
4<br><br>
w/w of a hydrophilic matrix forming polymer, characterized in that the composition further comprises from 0.2% to 5% w/w of alkali C16-23 alkyl fumarate as a lubricant.<br>
US patent 5,723,114 describes a method for enhancing permeation of a topically administered therapeutic or prophylactic agent in a host in need of the cutaneous or transdermal administration of a therapeutic or prophylactic agent. Wherein the penetration enhancing compound is selected from the group consisting of lasalocid, nigericin,valinomycin, chloroquine, gramicidin D, salinomycin, N-ethylmaleimide, N,N-dicyclohexyl carbodiimine and bafilomycin A1 or B1.<br>
US patent Application 20030166553 describes a composition for preventing and treating digestive organs diseases. The composition is prepared using among other potential pharmaceutical agents and dosage forms, proton pump inhibitors and transmucosal drug.<br>
Generally enteric coated tablet of proton pump inhibitors (PPI) of Benzimidazole class are dissolve in Gl tract below the stomach, after it passed through the stomach without getting degraded. So the onset of action is delayed.<br>
To overcome the drawback of enteric coated tablet of PPI of Benzimidazole class, uncoated transmucosal drug delivery system for PPIs of Benzimidazole class is prepared.<br>
5<br><br>
Disclosure of the Invention:<br>
The objective of the present invention is to formulate uncoated<br>
transmucosal drug delivery system (tablet) of stable dosage form and fast dissolution of dosage form and absorption in oral cavity. Its flavoured taste gives better patient compliance. Proton Pump Inhibitors of Benzimidazole class are Lansoprazole, Omeprazole, Pantoprazole, Rabeprazole and similar compounds such as salts, derivatives and isomers used for the treatment of Gastro Endothelial Related Diseases (GERD) and other pathological hyper secretory conditions.<br>
According to the present invention, a method of producing mucosal delivery drugs is outlined below wherein the drug Lansoprazole is either mixed in directly compressible ingredients or granules of the same are manufactured using wet granulation or dry granulation method.<br>
Lactose, MCC, mannitol, sodium bicarbonate, Di-sodium hydrogen orthophosphate, magnesium carbonate, sucrose or glucose are used as diluents and directly compressed in tablet form; lysine or glycine are used as stabilizer in preparation of drug delivery system. Sodium hydroxide is also used as stabilizer of the drug. Sodium lauryl sulphate, croscarmellose sodium, crospovidone, SSG, indion (resin) are used to achieve appropriate disintegration. Sodium stearyl fumarate is used as lubricant. Cellulose ethers or alginates are used as mucoadhesive polymer.<br>
The present invention relates to use of PPI"s in the uncoated form, which is administered in oral cavity e.g. sublingual, buccal and gingival.<br>
6<br><br>
The invention also describes the dosage form which eliminates the destabilizing effect of PPI"s by gastric juice and avoids extensive hepatic metabolism commonly encounters with this class of drugs.<br>
Use of oral drug delivery system (DDS) will also help in reducing the onset of action and reduce dosage requirement.<br>
Incventive composition comprises Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPI) as active ingredients. Lansoprazole, Omeprazole, Pantoprazole, Esomeprazole, Pariprazoie, Lamiprazole, Rabeprazole and their salts, derivatives and isomers are Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPI) of Benzimidazole class. Inventive composition is oral transmucosal drug delivery system and prepared by using either dry granulation or wet granulation or direct compression method. These PPI are degraded in aqueous solution and the rate of degradation in aqueous solution increases with respect to decrease in pH of the aq. Solution. The pH of oral saliva is about 6.5 and PPI"s are stable enough in this pH to allow them to be absorbed whereas these are quite unstable and degrade in low acidic pH of the stomach.<br>
Once the tablet (drug delivery system) absorbed through oral mucosal layer, drug is available to various tissue through blood stream including parietal cells to elicit the desired pharmacological actions.<br>
The said transmucosal tablet is administered by keeping the dosage form under the tongue or under the cheek (gingival), or between the cheek and gum to aid absorption through oral mucosal without swallowing.<br>

The said invention involve a process of making uncoated tablets which are absorbed through oral mucosa and elicits action and does not require to enteric coat to protect the drug from acidic environment of stomach. Presently available capsules or tablets of PPI of Benzimidazole class, involves coating of drug which protects it in stomach but release the drug below the stomach.<br>
The conventional enteric coated tablets, therefore require to be evaluated for absorption behavior by dissolution study in stomach for 2 hour (usual duration for stomach emptying/residence time in stomach) followed by phosphate buffer pH 6.8 for 45 minutes.<br>
Presented invention involves a transmucosal dosage form, where the absorption behavior can be assessed by doing dissolution study only in phosphate buffer pH 6.8 (approximate pH of oral cavity).<br>
