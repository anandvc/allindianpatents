				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a refrigerator, and more particularly, to a refrigerator with an icemaker having a structure for supplying ice from an outside of the refrigerator through a dispenser.<br>
Discussion of the Related Art<br>
A refrigerator is an apparatus for taking storage of foods freshly for a long-term period. Such refrigerator has a food-storage chamber therein. The food-storage chamber is always maintained at a low temperature by a refrigerating cycle for keeping food fresh.<br>
The food-storage chamber is divided into a plurality of storage chambers having different characteristics from each other such that a user can choose a food-storage method in consideration of a kind, a characteristic and an expiration date of food. Typical examples of the storage chambers are a cooling chamber and a freezer.<br>
The cooling chamber keeps a temperature at about 3°C-4°C for keeping food and vegetables fresh for a long time. The freezer keeps a temperature at a sub-zero temperature for keeping and storing meat and fish frozen for a long time and making and storing ice. Generally, the cooling chamber is larger than the freezer and the freezer is provided on top of the cooling chamber.<br><br><br>
Meanwhile, the refrigerator is developed for performing various additional functions besides a typical function thereof. For example, the user had to open a door and take out a water bottle kept in the cooling chamber to drink cold water kept in the cooling chamber hitherto.<br>
However, a refrigerator having a water dispenser provided at an outside of the door for supplying cold water cooled by cool air of the cooling chamber is developed and the user can drink cold water at outside of the refrigerator without opening the door. Furthermore, a product with water purifying function being added to the water dispenser is being supplied.<br>
The water dispenser generally includes a door enabling to open and close the cooling chamber so as to easily supply water stored in the cooling chamber to an outside thereof. The cooling chamber is provided at a bottom of the freezer and the water dispenser is provided at a relatively lower place. Therefore, there is an inconvenience that the user has to stoop his/her back for using the dispenser.<br>
Meanwhile, the user often uses the ice when the user drinks water or beverage and when the user cooks food. However, in this case, there is an inconvenience that the user has to open the door and separates the ice stored in the ice tray from the ice tray for using the ice. Also, when the door is open for using the ice, cool air in the freezer leaks out to the outside thereof and the temperature of the freezer goes up. Therefore, compressor is required to work more and there is a problem that energy is wasted.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible,<br><br>
the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts.<br>
A conventional refrigerator has a structure that a cooling chamber is provided at a lower part thereof and a freezer at an upper part thereof. However, the freezer is provided at a lower part of the refrigerator and the cooling chamber at an upper part thereof in the refrigerator according to the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, the refrigerator according to the preset invention includes a cooling chamber 1 provided at the upper part thereof and a freezer 2 at the lower part thereof. A door la is provided on a front surface of the cooling chamber 1 and a water dispenser 3 is provided at the door la.<br>
The water dispenser 3 enables a user to be supplied with cold water at an outside without opening the door la. For this, a water tank is provided on an inner surface of the door la. The water tank (not illustrated) stores water and cool air in the cooling chamber 1 cools the water stored in the water tank. Accordingly, the user operates a lever (not illustrated) and is supplied with cold water stored in the water tank through the water dispenser 3.<br>
As mentioned above, the refrigerator according to the present invention has a structure providing the cooling chamber 1 at the upper part of the refrigerator and the freezer 2 at the lower part thereof. Accordingly, the water dispenser 3 is provided at a waist height or a chest height. Therefore, it is easy and convenient for the user to use the dispenser 3 according to the present invention.<br>
Meanwhile, in the refrigerator according to the present invention, not only the water dispenser 3 but also an icemaker 10 is provided. Hereinafter, the icemaker will be described referring to the drawings. As a reference, the icemaker and an ice container provided in the<br><br>
refrigerator of FIG. 1 are illustrated in FIGS. 2 and 3 and an operation of those is described in FIG. 4.<br>
The icemaker 10 and the ice container 20 are provided in the freezer 2 provided at a lower part of the cooling chamber 1. The icemaker 10 includes an ice tray 11, a water supplier 12, an ejector 14 and a motor 13 as illustrated in FIG. 2. In this case, the ice tray 11 includes an open top and an interior formed as a semi cylindrical form for storing water and the ice inside thereof.<br>
A plurality of ribs 1 la is provided in the ice tray 11 for dividing the interior space into a plurality of sections. The plurality of ribs 1 la protrudes from the inner surface of the ice tray 11 as illustrated in FIG. 2.<br>
The water supplier 12 is provided at a side of the ice tray 11 as illustrated in FIG. 2 for perfonning a role of supplying water to the ice tray 11. A bracket 15 is provided at a rear side of the ice tray 11 for fixing the icemaker 10 to the freezer as illustrated in FIG. 2.<br>
Meanwhile, the ejector 14 includes a shaft 14a and a plurality of fins 14b. The shaft 14a as a central axis of the ejector 14 is placed to cross the center along the longitudinal direction at an upper inside of the ice tray 11. The plurality of fins 14b is extended in a radius direction on an outer circumferential surface of the shaft 14a. It is desirable that the plurality of fins 14b is provided at a same interval along the longitudinal direction of the shaft 14a. Particularly, each of the plurality of fins is placed in each section provided in the ice tray 11 by the ribs 1 la.<br>
The motor 13 is provided at a point of an outer circumferential surface of the ice tray 11 to be pivotly coupled with the shaft. Accordingly, when the shaft 14a is rotated via the motor 13, the plurality of fins 14b are rotated together. Each of the plurality of fins 14b pushes each ice in the ice tray 11 and drops to a lower part of the icemaker 10.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, a plurality of strips 16 is provided in a front part of the ice tray 11, i.e., at an upper end of a side opposite to a side where the bracket 15 is provided. Each of the<br><br>
plurality of strips 16 is extended from a front upper part of the ice tray 11 to a part around the shaft 14a. In this case, there is a little gap between each of the plurality of strips 16. The fins pass through the gap when the shaft 14a is rotated.<br>
In the mean time, the ice in the ice tray 11 is pushed by the shaft 14a, separated from the ice tray 11 and dropped onto the plurality of strips 16 after being separated completely when the shaft 14a is rotated. The ices dropped onto the plurality of strips 16 are dropped again onto the lower part of the icemaker 10 to be stored in the ice container 20 provided at the lower part of the icemaker 10. Accordingly, an upper surface of the plurality of strips 16 leads the ice separated from the ice tray 11 to the lower part of the plurality of strips 16. Therefore, it is desirable that a side of the plurality of strips 16 adjacent to the shaft 14a slopes toward one side and thus the side of the plurality of strips 16 near the shaft 14a is arranged at a higher place than a front side of the ice tray 11.<br>
A structure is required for preventing the ice from being dropped to a rear side of the ice tray 11, the ice separated from the ice tray 11. For this, it is desirable that a rear end of the ice tray 11 is provided to be higher than the shaft 14a as illustrated in FIG. 3 according to the present invention. Then, the ice moved to the rear side of the ice tray 11 by the plurality of fins 14b and separated from the ice tray 11 are smoothly leaded to the front side of the ice tray 11 and dropped onto the upper surface of the plurality of strips 16.<br>
Meanwhile, a heater 17 is provided at a lower surface of the ice tray 11 as illustrated in FIG. 4. The heater 17 heats a surface of the ice tray 11 for a short time and slightly melts the ice on the surface of the ice tray 11. Accordingly, the ices hi the ice tray are easily separated when the shaft 14a and the plurality of fins 14b rotate.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2 to FIG. 4, a sensing arm 18 is provided in the icemaker 10 for estimating an amount of ices stored in the container 20. The sensing arm 18 is controlled by a<br><br>
controller (not illustrated) and moved up and down so as to estimate the amount of ices stored in the container 20. For example, the sensing arm 18 periodically descends. Descending amount is large when a small amount of ices is stored hi the container 20. On the other hand, the sensing arm 18 is bumped into the ice and thus descending amount is small when a large amount of ices are stored hi the container 20. Accordingly, the controller estimates the amount of ice hi the ice container 20 with a descended amount<br>
Meanwhile, the container 20 provided at a lower part of the icemaker 10 has an open top for receiving and storing the ice dropped from the icemaker 10 as illustrated in FIG. 3 and FIG. 4. An outlet 21 is provided on a side of the ice container 20, for example, on a floor for discharging the ice to a lower part thereof as illustrated in FIG. 3.<br>
In the mean time, a transporting device 22 is provided hi the ice container 20 for transporting the ice stored in the container 20 toward a side of the outlet 21. The transporting device 22 is formed in a zigzag form and provided to cross an inside of the container 20. The transporting device 22 coupled to the motor 23 rotates and transports the ice stored in the container 20 toward the side of the outlet 21.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, a crusher 30 is provided at the side of the outlet 21 in the container 20. The crusher 30 includes a housing 31, a shaft 32, a supporter 33 and a blade 34.<br>
The housing 31 is provided on top of the outlet 21 in the container 20 and a surface, i.e., a side facing the transporting device 22 is formed in an opened form.<br>
The shaft 32 is perpendicularly provided in the housing 31 and coupled with and rotated together with the transporting device 22.<br>
The blade 34 coupled with the shaft 32 crushes the ice transported by the transporting device 22 rotating together with the shaft 32. At least one blade 34 is provided. When a plurality<br><br>
of the blades is provided, it is desirable that the plurality of blades is provided at both sides around the supporter 33.<br>
When the icemaker 10 and the ice container 20 are provided in the freezer 2, a plurality of pieces of ice produced from the icemaker 10 are stored in the ice container 20. Accordingly, it is convenient that the user opens the door 2a for opening the freezer 2 and takes out the plurality of pieces of ice stored in the ice container 20 to use needless to separate the ice from the ice tray. However, in this case, it is inconvenient that the door 2a should be opened and there is a problem that the energy is wasted because the door 2a is frequently opened.<br>
Accordingly, although it is not illustrated, an ice dispenser is provided at the door 2a for opening and closing the freezer 2 in the refrigerator according to the present invention. In this case, the ice dispenser is separately provided from the water dispenser 3. The user is supplied with ice produced from the icemaker 10 and stored in the ice container 20.<br>
For this, it is desirable that an ice discharger 40 is provided at the ice container 20 for selectively discharging an appropriated amount of ices. The ice discharger 40 includes an actuator 42 and a shutter 41 as illustrated in FIG. 3.<br>
The shutter 41 formed in a plate form is provided for opening and closing the outlet 21. The actuator 42 is coupled with the shutter 41 via a lever (not illustrated). In this case, for example, a solenoid type actuator is employed as the actuator 41.<br>
The ice discharger 40 composed as mentioned above, the actuator 42 operates according to a control signal of the controller and the shutter 41 controls an amount of opening and closing of the outlet 21 according to the actuator 42.<br>
Meanwhile, it is desirable that the ice discharger 40 provided as mentioned above in the present invention is provided for selectively discharging the crushed ice crushed by the crusher<br>
30 or the ice stored in the ice container 20.<br><br>
For this, the outlet 21 includes a first outlet 21a and a second outlet 21b as illustrated in FIG. 3. The shutter selectively opens or closes the second outlet 21b. In this case, the first outlet 21a is provided at a lower part of the crusher 30 as illustrated in FIG. 3 and the second outlet 21b is provided at a lower end of the transporting device next to the crusher 30.<br>
When the outlet 21 and the ice discharger 40 have the structure mentioned above, the ice discharger 40 selectively discharges the crushed or uncrushed ice. A brief description of this is as follows.<br>
If the user wants to be supplied with the crushed ice, the shutter 41 closes the second outlet 21b. Then, the ice stored in the ice container 20 is transported to the crusher 30 via the transporting device 22 and the crushed ice via the crusher 30 is discharged through the opened first outlet 2la.<br>
On the other hand, when the user wants to be supplied with uncrushed ice, the shutter 41 opens the second outlet 21 b. Then, the ice stored in the ice container is discharged to the second outlet 21 b before being transported to the crusher 30 via the transporting device 22. Accordingly, the user is supplied with uncrushed ice.<br>
Meanwhile, the structure for selectively providing the crushed or uncrushed ice is not limited to the structure mentioned above. For example, one discharger and one shutter for controlling the amount of opening and closing the discharger can be provided. In other words, the ice is discharged after being crushed by the crusher 30 when the shutter slightly opens the discharger and the ice is discharged without being crushed when the shutter completely opens the discharger.<br>
Hereinafter, an operation of the refrigerator composed as mentioned above according to the present invention will be described. First, when the controller determines via the sensing arm 18 that the ice in the ice container 20 is not enough, water is supplied to the water supplier 12.<br><br>
The water supplied to the supplier 12 is filled up the space between the each of the plurality of ribs 1 la in the ice tray 11 and frozen by cool air of the freezer 2. Therefore, a plurality of pieces of ice having a predetermined size is produced via the ribs 11 a in the ice tray 11.<br>
When a predetermined time period is passed and ice is produced, the heater is heated for a shot period of time. Accordingly, the outer surface of the ice tray 11 is slightly melted and each of the ices is separated from the ice tray 11. Then the motor 13 is operated and the shaft is rotated together with the fin 14b. Then the plurality of fins 14b push the ice between each of the plurality of ribs 1 la in a circumference direction of the ice tray 11 and the ice completely separated from the ice tray 11 via the plurality of fins 14b is dropped onto the dropper 16 and subsequently to the lower part of the icemaker 10. The ice dropped onto the lower part of the icemaker 10 is stored in the container 20.<br>
When a predetermined amount of ice is filed up the container 20 by repeating the process mentioned above, the amount of ice is estimated via the sensing arm 18 and the controller stops the ice. Of course, when the sensing arm 18 determines that the amount of the ice is still not enough, the controller keeps producing the ice and storing the ice in the ice container 20 by repeating the process.<br>
Meanwhile, if the user operates the control panel provided on the outer surface of the door 2a when the ice container 20 is filled up with the ice, the user is supplied with the crushed ice or uncrushed ice through the ice dispenser. Hereinafter, the process will be described.<br>
When the user selects a function for supplying the crushed ice by operating the control panel, the shutter 41 closes the second outlet 21b or slightly opens the outlet 21. In this case, the motor 23 rotates and transports the large ice stored in the ice container 20 to the crusher 30. Then, all ice stored in the ice container 20 is transported to the crusher 30. Accordingly, the<br><br>
crushed ice crushed by the crusher 30 is discharged through the first outlet 21a. The discharged ice is supplied to the user through the ice dispenser.<br>
On the other hand, when the user selects a function for supplying large and uncrushed ice by operating the control panel, the shutter 41 opens the second outlet 21b or mostly opens outlet 21. Then, the ice transported toward the crusher via the transporting device 22 is discharged through the outlet 21 before reaching the crusher 30 and is supplied to the user through the ice dispenser.<br>
As aforementioned, the user is selectively supplied with crushed ice or uncrushed ice using the refrigerator according to the present invention. However, despite of the advantage, the refrigerator described referring to FIG. 1 to FIG. 4 according to the present invention has a few disadvantages as follows.<br>
First, when the ice dispenser is not provided at the door for opening and closing the freezer, the door needs to be opened for taking out the ice. It is not only inconvenient but also wasting energy.<br>
Second, when the dispenser is provided at the door for opening and closing the freezer, the freezer and the ice dispenser are provided at the lower part of the cooling chamber 1. In this case, it is inconvenient that the user needs to stoop down for being supplied with the ice.<br>
Third, when the water dispenser and the ice dispenser are provided, there is a problem that the structure is very complicated for manufacturing and the prime cost is increased. And also, it is inconvenient for the user to use the water dispenser and the ice dispenser separately.<br>
Accordingly, the refrigerator with an improved structure is provided for complementing the problem of the embodiment. The dispenser is provided at the door for opening and closing the cooling chamber provided on top of the freezer in the refrigerator according to the present<br>
invention. Accordingly, it is easy and convenient for the user to use the dispenser. Also, water<br><br>
stored in the water tank provided at the cooling chamber is supplied through the dispenser when the refrigerator has the structure. Therefore, the user is supplied with ice or water through one dispenser provided at a location corresponding a waist or chest of the user.<br>
The refrigerator with the unproved structure is illustrated in FIG. 5 to FIG. 7. Hereinafter, the structure of the improved refrigerator according to the present invention will be described referring to the drawings. As a reference, FIG. 5 is a diagram showing the unproved refrigerator according to the present invention. FIG. 6 is a side sectional view showing a first embodiment of the refrigerator of FIG. 5. FIG. 7 is a side sectional view showing a second embodiment of the refrigerator of FIG. 5.<br>
First, referring to FIGS 5 and 6, the first embodiment will be described. Referring to FIGS. 5 and 6, a cooling chamber 52 is provided at upper part in a cabinet 50 and a freezer 51 is provided at lower part in the cabinet 50. In this case, the cooling chamber 52 and the freezer 51 are divided via a mullion 64 as illustrated in FIG. 6.<br>
Referring to FIG. 6, an evaporator 65 is provided at the freezer 51 and a fan 66 is provided near the evaporator 65. Accordingly, cool air generated near the evaporator 65 is supplied to the freezer 51 and the cooling chamber 52. Meanwhile, the evaporator 65 is not provided at only the freezer 51. That is, although not illustrated, me evaporator can be provided at the cooling chamber. Furthermore, a plurality of evaporators 65 can be provided at the freezer<br>
51	and the cooling chamber 51.   However, an embodiment providing one evaporator 65 at the<br>
