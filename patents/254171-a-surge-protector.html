				<td>Description<br>
Spark gap comprising an optically triggered power semiconductor<br>
component<br>
The invention relates to a surge protector comprising a spark<br>
gap, which has mutually opposite electrodes, a trigger circuit<br>
for triggering the spark gap and a light source, which is<br>
connected to a protective device, at ground potential for<br>
generating a trigger light, which can be supplied to a<br>
reception unit of the trigger circuit by means of at least one<br>
optical waveguide, the spark gap and the trigger circuit being<br>
at a high-voltage potential.<br>
Such a surge protector is already known from the common prior<br>
art. Figure 1 shows such a surge protector, which has a main<br>
spark gap 2 comprising main electrodes 3. The main electrodes<br>
are connected in parallel with series capacitors, which are<br>
connected to a three-phase AC voltage system at a high-voltage<br>
potential. Owing to the bridging by means of the spark gap, the<br>
capacitor is protected against excessively high voltages. In<br>
this case, the series capacitors or other electronic components<br>
to be protected are arranged on a platform 4, which is set up<br>
in an insulated manner and is supported by means of supports in<br>
the form of columns (not illustrated in the figures) in an<br>
environment at ground potential. For example, the main<br>
electrode 3 illustrated at the bottom in figure 1 is therefore<br>
at a high-voltage potential, which corresponds to that of the<br>
platform 4, while the main electrode 3 illustrated at the top<br>
in figure 1 is at the high-voltage potential of the three-phase<br>
system. There is a voltage drop of between approximately 60 kV<br>
and 16 0 kV between the main electrodes, with the result that<br>
the<br><br>
components arranged on the platform 4 are designed for this<br>
voltage drop.<br>
In order to actively trigger the spark gap 2, a trigger circuit<br>
5 and a trigger electrode 6 are provided, the trigger circuit 5<br>
having a capacitive voltage divider comprising a first<br>
capacitor 7 and a second capacitor 8. The second capacitor 8<br>
can be bridged by a parallel branch, in which a tripping spark<br>
gap 9 and, connected in series with this tripping spark gap, a<br>
nonreactive resistor 10 are arranged. The tripping spark gap 9<br>
can be moved over to its on position by means of control<br>
electronics 11, in which position a current flow via the<br>
parallel branch and thus bridging of the second capacitor 8 is<br>
made possible. Owing to the bridging, the trigger electrode 6<br>
is connected to the potential of the lower main electrode 3,<br>
which is arranged physically closer to the upper main electrode<br>
3 than the lower main electrode 3, however. A spark discharge<br>
results, which jumps over to the lower main electrode 3. The<br>
control electronics 11 can be supplied with the energy required<br>
for tripping the tripping spark gap 9 via an energy supply 12.<br>
Triggering of the tripping spark gap 9 takes place actively. In<br>
this case, a protective device 13 monitors measured electrical<br>
variables of the three-phase system such as the alternating<br>
current of each phase of the three-phase system and/or the<br>
voltage drop across the electronic components on the platform<br>
4. If tripping conditions are present, such as, for example, a<br>
threshold voltage at the component being exceeded, the<br>
protective device 13 generates a tripping signal, which is<br>
transmitted to a semiconductor laser 14, which thereupon<br>
generates an optical tripping signal, which is fed, via an<br>
optical waveguide 15, to the control electronics 11, as the<br>
reception unit. On reception of an optical tripping<br><br>
signal or in other words a trigger light, the control<br>
electronics cause the spark gap 2 to be tripped electrically.<br>
The protective device 13 and the semiconductor laser 14 are at<br>
a ground potential, which makes it easier to gain access and<br>
simplifies maintenance, if required. The optical waveguide 15<br>
makes it possible for the trigger light to be passed on safely,<br>
at the same time the insulation between the platform 4, which<br>
is at a high-voltage potential, and the components 13 and 14,<br>
which are at ground potential, of the surge protector 1 being<br>
maintained.<br>
In particular owing to the electronics required with the energy<br>
supply on the platform 4, the previously known surge protector<br>
is cost-intensive and complex in terms of its maintenance.<br>
One object of the invention is to provide a surge protector of<br>
the type mentioned initially which is reliable and cost-<br>
effective .<br>
This object is achieved by the invention by the reception unit<br>
having at least one power semiconductor component, which can be<br>
moved over, by means of the trigger light, from an off<br>
position, in which a current flow via the power semiconductor<br>
component is interrupted, to an on position, in which a current<br>
flow via the power semiconductor component is made possible.<br>
The invention simplifies driving of the surge protector.<br>
Instead of supplying the trigger light to an optoelectric<br>
converter, for example a diode, which generates an electrical<br>
tripping signal as a function of the<br><br>
received light intensity, the trigger light is supplied<br>
directly to a power semiconductor component which can be<br>
triggered optically, which makes a current flow possible owing<br>
to the triggering. In this manner, a current flow is made<br>
possible for a short period of time, for example, in a current<br>
branch, it being possible for said current flow to be<br>
established using any desired circuitry for triggering the<br>
spark gap. In contrast to the prior art, the power<br>
semiconductor components do not require an energy supply, which<br>
is susceptible to maintenance, at a high-voltage potential,<br>
with the result that the surge protector according to the<br>
invention stands out as regards its costs and reliability.<br>
The semiconductor components are advantageously in the form of<br>
thyristors which are connected in opposition and can be<br>
triggered optically. Thyristors can actively only be moved over<br>
from their off position to the on position. The reverse<br>
operation takes place passively. In the event of a zero<br>
crossing of an alternating current flowing via the thyristor,<br>
the alternating current falls below the holding current of the<br>
power switch component, with the result that said power switch<br>
component is again moved over to its off position. In order to<br>
increase the dielectric strength, a plurality of thyristors can<br>
also be connected in series.<br>
In accordance with one expedient further development in this<br>
regard, further optical waveguides are provided, with the<br>
result that each thyristor can be supplied with trigger light<br>
via a dedicated optical waveguide. In order to feed the trigger<br>
light into the further optical waveguide, a corresponding<br>
number of further light sources is provided, for example, which<br>
are each connected to an associated optical waveguide. As a<br>
deviation from this, it is possible to use one or more optical<br>
couplers in order to distribute the trigger light from a single<br>
light source between the available optical waveguides, as<br>
required. Optical<br><br>
couplers are known from the prior art, and therefore no further<br>
details need to be given at this juncture explaining their<br>
operation.<br>
The trigger circuit advantageously has a capacitive voltage<br>
divider, which has a capacitor which can be bridged by means of<br>
the power semiconductor component. Owing to the bridging of one<br>
of the capacitors of the voltage divider, it is possible, for<br>
example, for a current surge to be generated, with the result<br>
that a voltage pulse can be generated in a trigger coil, via a<br>
coil, which brings about tripping of the spark gap.<br>
As a deviation from this, the trigger circuit is connected to a<br>
trigger electrode, whose distance from a first electrode of the<br>
spark gap is less than the distance between a first electrode<br>
and the second electrode opposite it, it being possible for the<br>
electrical potential of the second electrode to be applied to<br>
the trigger electrode by means of the trigger circuit.<br>
In one expedient variant, the spark gap has at least two pairs<br>
of mutually opposite electrodes, which are arranged in a series<br>
circuit with respect to one another, the capacitor which can be<br>
bridged being connected in parallel with a pair of mutually<br>
opposite electrodes. In other words, the spark gap comprises<br>
two or more spark gap sections. Once the capacitor has been<br>
bridged, the voltage drop previously present across all of the<br>
spark gap sections is now present across the spark gap sections<br>
which are not bridged. Owing to the thereby increased voltage<br>
drop across the unbridged spark gap sections, a spark discharge<br>
occurs across these spark gap sections. Once the semiconductor<br>
component has been moved over to its off<br><br>
position, there is also an increased voltage drop across the<br>
spark gap sections which are connected in parallel with the<br>
capacitor, said increased voltage bringing about a spark<br>
discharge in this case, too.<br>
In the context of the invention, it is furthermore possible for<br>
an auxiliary spark gap to be triggered by the power<br>
semiconductor component, said auxiliary spark gap being part of<br>
the trigger circuit, the spark gap which is connected in<br>
parallel with the component to be protected being triggered by<br>
the auxiliary spark gap being triggered. If required, the<br>
trigger circuit comprises a plurality of auxiliary spark gaps<br>
which are connected in series with one another in order to<br>
increase the dielectric strength of the trigger circuit. In<br>
this case, it may be sufficient, as has previously been<br>
described, to only bridge one auxiliary spark gap by the power<br>
semiconductor components.<br>
In accordance with one preferred development of the invention,<br>
the spark gap and the trigger circuit are arranged on a<br>
platform which is supported in an insulated manner by means of<br>
supports and is designed to bear components which are provided<br>
for the purpose of improving the power transmission in an AC<br>
voltage-carrying energy distribution system. Such components<br>
are, for example, capacitors or coils, which are used to<br>
compensate for wattless power and are either connected in<br>
series or in parallel in the three-phase system. In this<br>
manner, excessively large distances between terminals of the<br>
components at a high-voltage potential and terminals at ground<br>
potential can be avoided. Owing to the parallel circuit with<br>
the surge protector, the components can be protected against<br>
surges.<br>
According to the invention, the light source is, for example,<br>
an expedient laser. The laser may be arranged in the direct<br><br>
vicinity of the control unit, the laser pulses for tripping the<br>
surge protector being transmitted via the nonconductive optical<br>
waveguide to the platform and received there by the power<br>
semiconductor component, as a result of which triggering of the<br>
spark gap and therefore protection of the desired component on<br>
the platform is provided. A suitable laser is, for example, a<br>
semiconductor laser, whose laser pulse can be coupled into the<br>
optical waveguide(s) via a coupling element. As a deviation<br>
from this, however, it is also possible for a fiber laser to be<br>
integrated in the optical waveguide(s), said fiber laser being<br>
pumped via a semiconductor laser. In this case, the<br>
semiconductor laser is connected to a protective device, which<br>
in turn is supplied with measured electrical variables by<br>
measuring transducers, which measure, for example, the voltage<br>
drop across a component, the surge protector being provided for<br>
the purpose of protecting this component. The component is, for<br>
example, a capacitor which is arranged on a platform and is<br>
connected in series in one phase of a three-phase system. The<br>
measured values produced by the measuring transducer are<br>
sampled and digitized, the protective device comparing the<br>
digital voltage values derived from the measured values with<br>
tripping conditions via logic implemented in it and generating<br>
a tripping signal in the event of a tripping condition being<br>
present, which tripping signal causes the semiconductor laser<br>
to output a laser pulse.<br>
Further expedient refinements and advantages of the invention<br>
are the subject matter of the description below relating to<br>
exemplary embodiments of the invention with reference to the<br>
figures xn the accompanying drawing, in which<br>
figure 1 shows a previously known surge protector in<br>
accordance with the prior art,<br><br>
figure 2 shows an exemplary embodiment of the surge protector<br>
according to the invention, in a schematic<br>
illustration, and<br>
figure 3 shows a further embodiment of the surge protector<br>
according to the invention, in a schematic<br>
illustration.<br>
Figure 1 shows a surge protector in accordance with the prior<br>
art, which has already been described above.<br>
Figure 2 shows an exemplary embodiment of the surge protector 1<br>
according to the invention, which is provided for the purpose<br>
of protecting a component (not illustrated in the figure), such<br>
as a high-voltage capacitor, the high-voltage capacitor being<br>
connected in series in a high-voltage three-phase system. As<br>
has already been described in connection with figure 1, the<br>
electrical components arranged on the platform 4 are at a high-<br>
voltage potential, whose voltage drop with respect to the<br>
respective phases of the three-phase system is in the medium-<br>
voltage range. In this manner, excessively large distances can<br>
be avoided in order to bring about the required dielectric<br>
strengths. The surge protector is arranged in a parallel<br>
circuit with the component to be protected.<br>
As the surge protector shown in figure 1, the surge protector 1<br>
shown in figure 2 is triggered actively, voltage values which<br>
are present across the component to be protected being fed to<br>
the protective device 13, which checks them for the presence of<br>
a tripping condition. If the voltage drop across the component<br>
to be protected exceeds, for example, a maximum threshold<br>
value, the protective device generates an electrical<br><br>
tripping pulse for the purpose of tripping the laser 14, which<br>
thereupon generates a light pulse as the trigger light, which<br>
can be coupled into the optical waveguide 15. The electrically<br>
nonconductive waveguide 15 is connected at its end facing away<br>
from the laser 14 to a thyristor 16, which, after reception of<br>
a trigger pulse via the optical waveguide 15, is moved over<br>
from an off position, in which a current flow through the<br>
thyristor 16 is interrupted, to its on position, in which a<br>
current flow in one direction is made possible.<br>
The surge protector 1 shown is envisaged for alternating<br>
currents, with the result that two thyristors 16, which are<br>
connected in opposition, are connected in parallel with one<br>
another in order to allow currents having different polarities<br>
to pass through. The second thyristor 16 is also coupled to an<br>
optical waveguide 15, which leads to the laser 14. In this<br>
case, the laser 14 is equipped with means which couple the<br>
trigger light into one or the other optical waveguide 15,<br>
depending on the control signal on the part of the protective<br>
device 13.<br>
If one of the thyristors 16 is in its on position, the trigger<br>
electrode 6, whose distance from the upper (in figure 2) main<br>
electrode 3 is less than the distance between the lower main<br>
electrode 3 and the upper main electrode, is connected to the<br>
potential of the lower main electrode. Owing to the reduction<br>
in distance, there is a breakdown between the upper main<br>
electrode 3 and the trigger electrode 6, the trigger spark<br>
jumping from the upper main electrode to the lower main<br>
electrode as soon as both thyristors 16 are in their off<br>
position again. This occurs at a zero crossing for the<br>
alternating current.<br><br>
Figure 3 shows a further exemplary embodiment of the surge<br>
protector 1 according to the invention, in a schematic<br>
illustration. The spark gap 2 in this case comprises two spark<br>
gap sections 17, which each have a pair of mutually opposite<br>
electrodes 3. The spark gap sections 17 are arranged in a<br>
series circuit and are each connected in parallel with a<br>
capacitor 7, 8. When the capacitor 8 is bridged by the<br>
thyristors 16 being triggered, the total voltage is present<br>
across the upper (in figure 3) spark gap section 17, the<br>
electrodes of said spark gap section 17 having a distance<br>
between them which is insufficient for holding the total<br>
voltage. Trigger sparking results. Once the thyristors 16 have<br>
been moved over to their off position, the total voltage is<br>
present across the spark gap section 17 illustrated at the<br>
bottom in figure 3, said spark gap section 17 thereupon<br>
likewise triggering. Each of the spark gap sections has a<br>
dedicated gas-tight housing 18.<br>
Owing to the series circuit comprising spark gap sections 17,<br>
the spark gap 2 can overall be designed for relatively high<br>
voltages, without having to take on board disadvantages as<br>
regards its control possibilities. The spark gap shown in<br>
figure 3 is therefore designed for voltages in the range<br>
between 16 0 kV and 3 00 kV. The surge protector shown in figure<br>
2, on the other hand, can advantageously be used for voltages<br>
in the range between 6 0 kV and 16 0 kV.<br><br>
