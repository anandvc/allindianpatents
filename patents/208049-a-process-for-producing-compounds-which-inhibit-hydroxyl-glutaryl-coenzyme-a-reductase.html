The present invention relates to a process for producing compounds of Formula (II-a) and Formula (Il-b) which inhibits hydroxymethylglutaryl Coenzyme A reductase (herein after abbreviated as HMG-CoA reductase) which have the activity to lower serum cholesterol levels.<br><br>
is known to inhibit HMG-CoA reductase and exhibit an action of reducing serum cholesterol and the like (The Journal of Antibiotics, 29, 1346 (1976)).<br><br>
There have been several reports regarding a method for producing the compound (Vl-a) or the compound (Vl-b) from a compound represented by the formula (V-a) (hereinafter referred to as compound (V-a)):<br><br>
using a microorganism.<br>
Specifically, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (kokai) No. 57-50894 describes a method which uses filamentous fungi; both Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (kokai) No. 7-184670 and International Publication WO96/40863 describe a method which uses Actinomycetes; and Japanese Patent No. 2672551 describes a method which uses recombinant Actinomycetes. As is well known, however, since filamentous fungi and Actinomycetes grow with filamentous form by elongating hyphae, the viscosity of the culture in a fermentor increases. This often causes shortage of oxygen in the culture, and since the culture becomes heterogeneous, reaction efficiency tends  to  be  reduced.     In order to  resolve  this  oxygen  shortage  and maintain<br><br>
homogeneousness of the culture, the agitation rate of the fermentor should be raised, but by raising the agitation rate, hyphae are sheared and activity of the microorganisms tends to decrease (Basic Fermentation Engineering (Hakko Kogaku no Kiso) p. 169 -190, RE Stansbury, A. Whitaker, Japan Scientific Societies Press (1988)).<br>
Furthermore, the above Actinomycetes and filamentous fungi have an ability to sporulate. Since spores tend to disperse much more easily than cells and have an ability of surviving even under conditions where vegetative cells perish readily, these spores tend to become a source of microorganism contamination in culturing and purification processes.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide an industrially advantageous method for producing a compound which inhibits HMG-CoA reductase and has an action of reducing the level of serum cholesterol and the like.<br>
The present inventors have considered that if hydroxylation of compound (V-a) or compound (V-b) could be carried out with a microorganism having hydroxylation activity, having no ability to sporulate and showing no hyphal growth, inconvenience such as the decrease of reaction efficiency due to microorganism contamination caused by the release of spores during the production process or the heterogeneity of the culture caused by formation of hyphae could be avoided, and that this would be industrially advantageous. As a result of intensive studies directed to this object, the present inventors have accomplished the present invention.<br>
Thus, the present invention relates to the following (1) to (9).<br>
Hereinafter, in the formulas, R1 represents a hydrogen atom, a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, or an alkali metal, and R represents a substituted or unsubstituted<br><br>

The methods for converting compound (I-a) or compound (I-b) into compound (Il-a) or compound (Il-b) may be a method of previously adding compound (I-a) or compound (I-b) to a medium in which a microorganism is to be cultured, or may be a method of adding compound (I-a) or compound (I-b) during culturing. Further, a method of allowing an enzyme source to act upon compound (I-a) or compound (I-b) in an aqueous medium may also be used.<br>
In a case where compound (I-a) or compound (I-b) is added to a medium in which a microorganism is to be cultured, 0.1 to lOmg, preferably 0.2 to lmg of the compound (I-a) or the compound (I-b) is added to 1 ml of medium at the beginning of or at some midpoint of the culture.    When compound (I-a) or compound (I-b) is added,<br><br>
it may be added after it is dissolved in a solvent such as methyl alcohol or ethyl alcohol.<br>
In a case where a method of allowing an enzyme source to act upon compound (I-a) or compound (I-b) in an aqueous medium, the amount of enzyme to be used depends on the specific activity of the enzyme source or the like. For example, when a culture of a microorganism or a treated product of the culture is used as an enzyme source, 5 to l,000mg, preferably 10 to 400mg of enzyme source is added per Img of compound (I-a) or compound (I-b). The reaction is performed in an aqueous medium, preferably at 20 to 50°C, and particularly preferably at 25 to 40°C. The reaction period depends on the amount, specific activity, etc. of the enzyme source to be used, but it is usually 0.5 to 150 hours, preferably 1 to 72 hours.<br>
Examples of an aqueous medium include water or buffers such as phosphate buffer, HEPES (N-2 hydroxyethylpiperazine-N-ethanesulfonate) buffer and Tris (tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane)hydrochloride buffer. An organic solvent may be added to the above buffers, unless it inhibits reaction. Examples of organic solvent include acetone, ethyl acetate, dimethyl sulfoxide, xylene, methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol and butanol. A mixture of an organic solvent and an aqueous medium is preferably used when compound (I-b) is used.<br>
According to the above production method, compound (Il-a) or a mixture of compound (Il-a) and compound (Il-b) can be obtained from compound (I-a).<br>
Similarly, compound (Il-b) or a mixture of compound (Il-a) and compound (Il-b) can be obtained from compound (I-b).<br>
Moreover, a mixture of compound (Il-a) and compound (Il-b) can be obtained from a mixture of compound (I-a) and compound (I-b).<br><br>
Compound (I-b) and compound (Il-b) can easily be converted into compound (I-a) and compound (II-a) respectively, by a method for opening a lactone ring as mentioned below. Likewise, compound (I-a) and compound (II-a) can easily be converted into compound (I-b) and compound (II-b) respectively, by a method for producing lactone as mentioned below.<br>
Examples of a method for opening a lactone ring include a method which comprises dissolving compound (I-b) or compound (II-b) in an aqueous medium and adding thereto an acid or alkali. Examples of the aqueous medium include water and an aqueous solution containing salts, which does not inhibit the reaction, such as phosphate buffer, Tris buffer and the like. The above aqueous solution may contain an organic solvent such as methanol, ethanol, ethyl acetate and the like in a concentration which does not inhibit the reaction. Examples of acid include acetic acid, hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid, and examples of alkali include sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide and ammonia.<br>
Examples of a method for producing lactone include a method which comprises dissolving compound (I-a) or compound (II-a) in a non-aqueous solvent and adding thereto an acid or base catalyst. As long as the non-aqueous solvent is an organic solvent which does not substantially contain water and is capable of dissolving compound (I-a) or compound (II-a), any type of non-aqueous solvent can be used.<br>
Examples of non-aqueous solvents include dichloromethane and ethyl acetate. As a catalyst, any catalyst can be used, as long as it catalyzes lactonization and does not show any actions other than lactonization on a substrate or a reaction product. Examples of the above catalyst include trifluoroacetic acid and p-toluenesulfonic acid. Reaction temperature is not particularly limited, but is preferably 0 to 100°C, and is more preferably 20 to 80°C.<br><br>
After completion of the reaction, compound (H-a) or compound (II-b) can be collected from the above solution by ordinary methods used in the field of organic synthetic chemistry such as extraction with organic solvents, crystallization, thin-layer chromatography, high performance liquid chromatography, etc.<br>
As a method for detecting and quantifying the compound (Il-a) or the compound (II-b) obtained by the present invention, any method can be used, as long as the detection or quantification of compound (Il-a) and/or compound (II-b) can be performed. Examples thereof include C-NMR spectroscopy, H-NMR spectroscopy, mass spectroscopy, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) etc.<br>
There may be stereoisomers such as optical isomers for some compounds among compound (I-a), compound (I-b), compound (Il-a) and compound (II-b). The present invention covers all possible isomers and mixtures thereof including these stereoisomers.<br>
As compound (I-a), compound (Ill-a) is preferable, compound (V-a) is more preferable, and compound (VH-a) is particularly preferable.<br>
As compound (I-b), compound (IH-b) is preferable, compound (V-b) is more preferable, and compound (VH-b) is particularly preferable.<br>
As compound (Il-a), compound (IV-a) is preferable, compound (Vl-a) is more preferable, and compound (VHI-a) is particularly preferable.<br>

The examples of the present invention is described below, but the present<br><br>
invention is not limited to these examples.<br>
The Best Mode for Carrying out the Invention Example 1.<br>
lOOmg of compound (Vll-b) (produced by Sigma) was dissolved in 9.5ml of methanol, and 0.5ml of lmol/1 sodium hydroxide was added. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 hour. The obtained reaction solution was dried to be solidified, and was dissolved by adding 5ml of deionized water, followed by adjusting pH to around 6.5 to 7.5 with about 0.1ml of lmol/1 hydrochloric acid. Then, 4.9ml of deionized water was added to the mixture to obtain 10ml of compound (VH-a), whose final concentration was lOmg/ml (a compound wherein, in formula (VH-a), R1 is sodium).<br>
Various types of microorganisms shown in Tables 1 and 2 were independently plated onto an agar medium (1% peptone (produced by Kyokuto Pharmaceutical Industrial Co., Ltd.), 0.7% meat extract (produced by Kyokuto Pharmaceutical Industrial Co., Ltd.), 0.3% NaCl, 0.2% yeast extract (produced by Nihon Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.), 2% bacto agar (produced by Difco), adjusted to pH7.2 with lmol/1 sodium hydroxide), then cultured for 3 days at each temperature shown in Tables 1 and 2. An inoculating loop of each of the strains which grew on the agar medium was inoculated into a test tube containing 3ml of LB medium (1% bacto tryptone (produced by Difco), 0.5% bacto yeast extract (produced by Difco), adjusted to pH7.2 with lmol/1 sodium hydroxide). This tube was then subjected to shaking culture for 24 hours at each temperature shown in Tables 1 and 2. After culturing, 0.25ml of the culture was inoculated in test tubes containing 5ml of TB medium (1.4% bacto tryptone (produced by Difco), 2.4% bacto yeast extract (produced by Difco), 0.231% KH2P04, 1.251% K2HPO4, adjusted to pH7.4 with lmol/1 sodium hydroxide). The tubes were then subjected to shaking culture for 24 hours at each temperature shown in Tables 1 and 2.    After 24 hours, the above-obtained compound (VH-a) was added to<br><br>
each of test tubes in a the final concentration of 0.4mg/ml, and then reaction was performed with shaking at each temperature shown in Tables 1 and 2 for 48 hours.<br>
After completion of the reaction, the reaction solution was adjusted to pH3.5 with acetic acid. 1 ml of ethyl acetate was added to 0.5ml of this reaction solution followed by shaking for 1 hour. After shaking, the reaction solution was separated into 2 layers by centrifugation at 3,000rpm for 5 minutes, then the upper ethyl acetate layer was collected. The solvent was removed with a centrifugal evaporator, and the residue was dissolved in 0.5ml of methanol. Using a portion of this methanol solution, HPLC analysis was carried out (Column: Inertsil ODS-2 (5//m, 4 X 250mm, produced by GL Science), Column temperature: 60°C, Mobile phase: acetonitrile:water:phosphoric acid = 55:45:0.05, Flow rate: 0.9ml/min, Detection wavelength: 237nm), to detect and quantify compound (VHI-a) (a compound wherein, in formula (VHI-a), R1 is sodium). The results are shown in Tables 1 and 2.<br><br><br><br><br>
Example 2.<br>
Mycobacterium gilvum JCM 6395 strain was plated onto the same agar medium as in Example 1 and was cultured at 37°C for 3 days. The strain which grew on the agar medium was inoculated into 4 test tubes each containing 3ml of LB medium, followed by shaking culture at 37°C for 24 hours. 1.25ml of each of the cultures was inoculated into eight 300-ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing 25ml of TB medium,<br><br>
followed by shaking culture at 37°C. After 24 hours, compound (VH-a) prepared as in Example 1 (a compound wherein, in formula (VH-a), R1 is sodium) was added in the final concentration of 0.4mg/ml, and the mixture was shaken at 37°C for 48 hours. After completion of the reaction, the culture was centrifuged at 3,000rpm at 4°C for 10 minutes to collect the supernatant. The pH of this supernatant was adjusted to 3.5 with acetic acid. After 400ml of ethyl acetate was added thereto, the mixture was shaken at 30°C for 1 hour. After leaving to stand, supernatant was collected. The same operation was repeated to the aqueous lower layer, then the obtained ethyl acetate layer was combined with the aforementioned supernatant. After 100ml of saturated saline solution was added to this ethyl acetate layer, the mixture was shaken, and supernatant was collected.<br>
Next, 5g of anhydrous Na2S04 was added to this supernatant and the mixture was left at room temperature for 15 minutes. Then, ethyl acetate was evaporated under reduced pressure so that the mixture was solidified. The obtained residue was dissolved in 5ml of deionized water, and pH was adjusted to 9.0 with sodium hydroxide, followed by passing the solution through a 50ml HP-20 column (25 X 100mm, produced by Mitsubishi Chemical Corp.) After washing the column with 150ml of deionized water, elution was carried out in a stepwise manner with 100ml of acetone solutions each of which contains 20%, 30% and 40% acetone. The collected fractions were subjected to the same HPLC analysis as in Example 1, thereby recovering a fraction containing compound (VHI-a). Acetonitrile was removed from this fraction under reduced pressure, then pH of the solution was adjusted to 3.0 with lmol/1 hydrochloric acid. After 360ml of ethyl acetate was added to this solution, the mixture was shaken. After leaving to stand, supernatant was collected. After 90ml of saturated saline solution was added to this supernatant, the mixture was shaken, and left to stand, and the supernatant was collected.<br>
Subsequently, 4.5g of anhydrous Na2S04 was added to this supernatant and<br><br>
the mixture was left at room temperature for 15 minutes followed by evaporating to dryness under reduced pressure. The obtained dried residue was dissolved in dichloromethane and lactonized by adding 1% trifluoroacetic acid. This reaction product was fractionated with preparative TLC (Silica gel plate: No. 1.05744 (200x200mm, thickness: 0.5mm, produced by Merck), development solvent: ethyl acetate, color-development solution: 12.5% phosphomolybdic acid-1% cerium/10% sulfuric acid solution), thereby obtaining 0.8mg of compound (VHI-b). The results of mass spectrum and *H-NMR spectrum analyses of the obtained compound (VHI-b) are as follows.<br>
Mass Spectrum<br>
Applying JMS-HX/HX110A mass spectrometer (manufactured by NIHON DENSHI Ltd), the measurement was done in a positive mode using m-nitrobenzyl alcohol as a matrix. As a result, a pseudoion peak ([M+H]+) was obtained at m/z 407, and the actual measurement value matched with the value expected from the structure and molecular weight (406) of compound (II-b).<br>
^-NMR spectrum<br>
Applying type JNM-a400 spectrometer (manufactured by NIHON DENSHI Ltd.), the measurement was done at 400MHz in duetero chloroform, using TMS as an internal standard. The results are shown below.
