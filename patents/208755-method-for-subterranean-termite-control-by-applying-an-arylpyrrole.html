BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A broad class of arylpyrrole compounds and their insecticidal use in crop protection and animal health are described in U.S. 5,010,098; U.S. 5,310,938; and U.S. 5,455,263.  It has now been found that a small select group of these arylpyrrole compounds are particularly useful for the control of pestiferous subterranean termites.<br>
Termites are known to occur in virtually every state in the U.S., except Alaska, in all U.S. territories, and throughout the world in every continent except Antarctica. Termites cause extensive damage to wood, wood structures, wood products and cultivated plants and crops.  They invade and damage poles, posts, timbers, lumber, buildings, shelters and the like.  They are also destructive to cultivated plants and crops where they burrow into stems, tunnel out stalks and roots, and girdle the bark of trees.  They eat grass and injure or damage field crops such as rubber, tea, coffee, cocoa, citrus and sugarcane.<br>
Conventional methods to control termites have a common mechanism of action.  This mechanism employs a chemical zone through which termites will not travel. Thxs zone acts as a barrier by, either directly or indirectly, repelling the termites.  However, while effective in repelling termites, conventional treatments cause very little, if any, effective control of the termite populations, as very few termites which encounter<br><br>
-2-<br>
the barrier actually expire.  Therefore, due to the minimal termite mortality and impact on termite foraging activity of conventional termite control methods, there remain vast populations of termites that continue to represent a significant threat to growing and harvested wood, wood products and wooden structures.  In light of the limitations of conventional materials and methods to control termite populations, alternatives to the conventional methods for controlling these significantly destructive insects is highly desirable.<br>
Therefore, it is an object of this invention to provide an efficient, efficacious method for the control of pestiferous subterranean termite populations.<br>
It is a feature of this invention that the pressure and threat of destructive termite populations may be significantly reduced.<br>
Further objects and features of the invention will become apparent in the detailed description set forth below.<br>
SPMMARY OF  THE   INVENTION<br>
The present  invention provides a method for the control of subterranean termite populations which comprises, applying to the soil a termiticidaliy effective amount of a non-repellent arylpyrrole compound of formula I<br><br><br><br><br>
-3-<br>
wherein<br>
R	is hydrogen or Ci-C4-alkoxymethyl;<br>
X	is Cl or Br and<br>
L, M and Q     are each independently hydrogen, Cl, Br, I, F or Ci-C4-haloalkyl,<br>
in the absence of pyrethroidal compounds.<br>
The invention also provides a composition for use in the method, comprising an arlypyrrole compound of formula 1 and a further insecticide, selected from the group consisting of carbonates, organochlorines or organophosphates.<br>
The arlypyrrole compound of formula 1 in the said composition is preferably between 10% and 50%, more preferably between 10% and 30% and most preferably between 10% to 22%.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Protecting growing and harvested wood, wood products and wooden structures from damage and destruction caused by termites while effectively controlling the populations of said termites is a continuing scientific challenge. Conventional methods and materials such as organophosphates , pyrethroids, chlorinated hydrocarbons, and the like employ a common mechanism of action which is to essentially to form a chemical barrier which directly or indirectly repels the targeted termites.  Consequently, the termite population size, and the pressure from said population, is not significantly reduced.  Therefore, because these populations continue to persist in the targeted ecological environment, they continue to forage and, through trial and error, find gaps in the chemical. barrier to gain access to the wood, wood product, or wooden structure meant to be protected.  Further, in the case of subterranean termite populations, post-treatment activities such as gardening, paving, remodeling, and the like may disturb the chemical barrier in the soil and create gaps that may be breached by the targeted subterranean termite populations.  Moreover, as the<br><br><br>
-4 -<br>
conventional materials degrade over time and become less effective as repellents, the largely uncontrolled populations of termites can return to attack and infest the susceptible wood, wood product or wooden structure.<br>
It has now been found that a select group of arylpyrrole compounds of formula I<br><br>
wherein R is hydrogen or C^-C^alkoxymethyl;<br>
X is Cl or Br; and<br>
L, M and Q are each independently hydrogen,<br>
Cl, Br, I, For Q-C^haloalkyl;<br>
is particularly useful for the control of pestiferous subterranean termites.  Advantageously, said compounds provide a non-repellent, slow-acting toxin useful for the control of pestiferous subterranean termites which imbibe or ingest soil for excavation or nutrition.  Said subterranean termites exchange nutrients between colony members; therefore, a slow-acting toxin allows sufficient time for one member to pass the toxin to another member before visible toxic effects are manifested.  This slow action is particularly useful for the effective control of subterranean, social, termite populations.  Further, since the select formula I arylpyrrole compounds are non-repellent, the targeted pestiferous termite colony members will continually travel through, attack or infest material which has been treated according to the method of invention, resulting in significant mortality, and control<br><br>
-5-<br>
of said colony members and concommitant reduction in termite population pressure.<br>
In the specification and claims, the term 11 subterranean termite" designates the order Isoptera and<br>
encompasses the families of Rhinotermitidae, Termitidae, Kalotermitidae, and Hodotermitid&amp;e*  Examples of species<br>
of suterranean termites controlled by the method of invention include Reticulitermes flavipes, Retxculitexmes virginicus, Reticuliteixnes hesperus, Coptotexmes formosaxxus and the like.<br>
Surprisingly, among the vast genre of arylpyrrole compounds known in the art, a small select group of formula I arylpyrroles are especially effective and particularly useful for the control of subterranean termites.  Those particular arylpyrrole compounds of formula I preferred for use in the method of invention are those formula I compounds wherein R is C^-C^alkoxymethyl.<br>
Another group of particular arylpyrrole compounds preferred for use in the method of invention is that group of compounds of formula I wherein L and Q are hydrogen and M is 4-Cl.<br>
A third group of compounds of formula I especially useful in the method of the invention is that group wherein X is Br.<br>

In accordance with the method of invention, effective control of pestiferous subterranean termite populations which imbibe or ingest soil for excavation or nutrition may be obtained by treating the soil with a spray, dust, powder , granule, solution, emulsion, suspension or dispersion containing an effective amount of the select arylpyrrole compound of formula I.  Rates of application of said arylpyrrole compound will vary according to prevailing environmental conditions such as insect species, population density, weather conditions, soil type, vegetation growth, topographical characteristics, and the like.  In general, rates of application of active ingredient sufficient to supply soil concentrations of about 1 ppm to 2,500 ppm, preferably about 25 ppm to 1,000 ppm may be effective.<br>
For a more clear understanding of the invention, the following examples are set forth below.  These examples are merely illustrative and are not understood to limit the scope or underlying principles of the invention in any way.  Indeed, various modifications of the invention, in addition to those shown and described herein, will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the<br><br>
-8-<br>
following examples and the foregoing description.  Such modifications are also intended to fall within the scope of the appended claims.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Evaluation Of The Termiticidal Activity Of Chlorfenapyr Over Time<br>
For this evaluation, ten termites (Reticulitermes virginicus) are placed in a 5 cm petri dish containing a thin layer of moist soil which has been treated with an acetone solution of chlorfenapyr at various concentrations.  (The acetone is evaporated before introduction of insects.)  Observations of insect mortality are made at 8 hr. and 24 hr. after treatment.  After 24 hr., all termites are removed from the treated soil and placed in 5 cm petri dishes containing non-treated soil and a strip of moistened cellulose filter paper as food supply. Observations of continued insect mortality are made daily for 7 days after exposure to the treated soil.  The treatments are replicated 3 times.  The data obtained are averaged and shown in Table I, below.<br><br>
	Table I				<br>
			% Mortality	<br>

Chlorfenapyr	5	0	0	100	<br>
Untreated Contro3	0	0	0	0<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
-9-<br>
DISCUSSION<br>
In this Example, the delayed-action mortality in termites exposed to the arylpyrrole compound is evident. There is no mortality after 8 hours of exposure to chlorfenapyr (Table I).  However, after 24 hours the percentage of mortality increases.  Further, over the next six days, even after the termites have been removed to untreated soil, mortality continues to increase. Ultimately, exposure to concentrations as low as 5 ppm chlorfenapyr causes 100% mortality.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Evaluation Of The Termiticidal Activity Of Test Compounds Over Time<br>
In this evaluation, samples of test compound are dissolved in acetone and applied to a sandy loam soil in quantities sufficient to supply concentrations of 1,000, 100, 10 and 1 ppm by weight.  Treated soil is then moistened with 5% by weight of water.  The moistened, treated soil (5 g) is placed uniformly over the bottom of a 100 x 15 mm glass dish.  Ten worker termites (Reticulitermes spp.) are placed on the treated soil and<br>
held for 7 days.  Observations of moribundity are made daily.  In this evaluation, moribundity is defined as ataxia, paralysis, or sluggishness.  Moribund termites are recorded and removed daily.  Each treatment is replicated 4 times.  The data are averaged and shown in Table II, below.<br><br>
-10-<br><br><br>
-11-<br>
DISCaSSION<br>
The unique delayed-action mortality of the formula I arylpyrrole compound is demonstrated by the data shown in Table II of this Example.  For instance, exposure to arylpyrrole compounds at concentrations of 10 ppm causes little moribundity after 24 hours (3.2% to 26.4%). However, after 7 days exposure, significant moribundity (75.6% to 100%) results for all of these compounds.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
Evaluation Of Tenniticidal Activity Of Chlorfenapyr On A Variety Of Species<br>
In this evaluation, moist soil is treated with a gradient dilution of a 2SC formulation of chlorfenapyr as described in U.S. Patent 5,496,845. Groups of 10 termites each from 4 different species of termites are placed in a 5 cm petri dish containing a thin layer of the treated soil.  Observations of insect mortality are made at 8 hr. and 24 hr. after treatment.  After 24 hr., all termites are removed from the treated soil and placed in petri dishes containing non-treated soil and a strip of moistened cellulose filter paper as food.  Insect mortality observations are made daily, for 7 days after exposure to the treated soil.  Each treatment is replicated 6 times.  The data are averaged and shown in Table III, below.<br><br>
-12-<br><br>
DISCTTSSION<br>
In this Example wherein all of the major species of subterranean termites in the U.S. are studied, the data in Table III clearly demonstrate that all termite species tested are equally susceptible to the lethal effects of the formula I arylpyrrole compound.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
Comparative Evaluation Of Non-Repellencv And Efficacy Of Formula I Arvlvrrole Compounds And Pvrethroid Compounds In The Soil<br>
A sandy loam soil is treated with acetone solutions of either chlorfenapyr or permethrin to obtain concentrations of 100, 10, or 1 ppm.  Untreated soil is used for the controls.  After treatments have dried, enough treated soil is transferred into 15 cm lengths of transparent plastic tubing {1.5 cm diam.) to form a<br><br>
-13-<br>
column of treated soil 5 cm in length.  A 1 cm thick 6% agar plug is fitted at each end of the 5 cm column of soil.  Several pieces of woodflour (food source) are placed in one open end which, when the tube is inverted,<br>
is situated beneath the treated-soil column.  Thirty (30) termites (Reticulitejrmes flavipes) are then introduced<br>
into the top open end of the plastic tubing opposite the food source.  Both ends of the tubing are sealed, to form a "test unit".  Test units are held at room temperature, in the dark, for the duration of the study.  After 1 day and 3 days, measurements are taken of the distance the termites tunnel into the 5 cm column of treated soil. Each concentration is replicated 4 times for each test compound.  At the conclusion of the experiment, the test units are destructively sampled to determine termite mortality.<br><br><br>
-14-<br>
DiscuBsion<br>
In Table IV, repellency is clearly demonstrated for the pyrethroid compound, permethrin.  There is very little penetration by the termites into the permethrin treated soil column, especially at rates of 100 or 10 ppm.  As can be seen, few termites died from exposure due to the repellency of permethrin.  Even at 1 ppm concentration of permethrin when termites penetrated through more than 50% of the treated soil column, mortality did not differ from that observed in the untreated control.  In contrast, the formula I arylpyrrole compound, chlorfenapyr, clearly demonstrated non-repellency. At all three concentrations of chlorfenapyr, the termites rapidly penetrated the treated soil column.  Further, exposure to the chlorfenapyr in the treated soil columns proved lethal to the termites.  Even at the lowest concentration tested (1 ppm), exposure to chlorfenapyr caused higher mortality in termites than did exposure to the same 1 ppm concentration of permethrin.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
Evaluation Of Non-Repellencv And Efficacy Of Test Compounds In The Soil<br>
In this evaluation, 300 termites (Reticulitermes flavipes) are added to a 5 cm-round tubular container filled with a sand/vermiculite substrate and containing a small, pre-weighed pine block (unprotected wood) .  This container is connected with a 7 cm length of 3 mm plastic tubing to a second container filled with a sandy loam soil which has been treated with a test compound.  At the opposite end of the second container is connected, by plastic tubing, a third container in which is placed a single pre-weighed block of pine wood (protected wood).  Termites must tunnel through<br><br>
-15-<br>
the treated soil in order to access the "protected" block of pine wood.  After 5 weeks, the termites from all containers are removed, % insect mortality is determined and the pine blocks are weighed.  The treatments are replicated 6 times.  The data is averaged and shown in Table V below.<br>

Control<br>
Discussion<br>
In this Example, the data in Table V demonstrate the advantages of the non-repellence of an arylpyrrole compound, chlorfenapyr.  In the absence of chlorfenapyr residues in the soil in the middle container, termites consume equal quantities of wood from both ends of the test chamber.  However, in all tests where the soil in the middle container is treated with chlorfenapyr, significantly less wood is consumed from the protected pine block than is consumed from the unprotected pine block.  In this study the percentage mortality is consistently &gt; 85% at soil concentrations as low as 50 ppm.<br><br>
