				<td>SPECIFICATION<br>
MODIFIED NATURAL RUBBER OR MODIFIED NATURAL RUBBER<br>
LATEX, AND RUBBER COMPOSITION AND PNEUMATIC TIRE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] This invention relates to a modified natural rubber or a modified<br>
natural rubber latex and a rubber composition using such a modified natural<br>
rubber or modified natural rubber latex as well as a pneumatic tire using such a<br>
rubber composition.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002] There is well-known a technique of grafting natural rubber with a<br>
vinyl compound, and MG latex and the like are already produced and are put into<br>
a practical use as an adhesive or the like (e.g. JP-A-2000-319339, JP-A-2002-<br>
138266). In this grafted natural rubber, however, a greater amount of the vinyl<br>
compound (20-50% by weight) is grafted as a monomer for changing the<br>
characteristics of natural rubber itself, so that the physical properties inherent to<br>
natural rubber (viscoelasticity, stress-strain curve in a tensile test or the like) is<br>
largely changed. Also, when the grafted natural rubber is compounded with<br>
carbon black and/or silica, the serious viscosity rise is caused to decrease the<br>
processability. Furthermore, as a greater amount of the other monomer is<br>
introduced into the molecular chain of natural rubber, the physical properties<br>
become entirely different from those inherent to natural rubber. Therefore,<br>
there is caused a problem that such a grafted natural rubber can not quite utilize<br>
the conventional methods making the beat use of the physical properties inherent<br>
to natural rubber.<br>
[0003] As a technique for improving the reinforcing property and affinity of<br>
a polymer with a filler such as carbon black, silica or the like, there are developed<br>
a terminal modification, a copolymerization with a monomer containing a<br>
functional group and so on in the field of synthetic rubbers. On the other hand,<br>
natural rubber is used in a greater amount owing to the excellent physical<br>
properties, but there is not known a technique that natural rubber itself is largely<br>
improved so as to make the reinforcing property and affinity to the filler equal to<br>
those of the above modified synthetic rubber.<br><br><br>
[0004] On the other hand, there are proposed a technique wherein an ester of<br>
a polyvalent alcohol with an unsaturated carboxylic acid, an organic compound<br>
having an unsaturated bond, or a vinyl monomer is compounded with natural<br>
rubber to conduct graft polymerization, a technique of epoxidizing natural rubber,<br>
and so on (e.g. JP-A-5-287121, JP-A-6-329702, JP-A-9-25468, JP-A-2002-<br>
348559). Particularly, the former technique is not a technique aiming at the<br>
improvement of the reinforcing property and affinity to the filler such as carbon<br>
black, silica or the like, but is a technique of largely changing the physical<br>
properties inherent to natural rubber. In these techniques, however, there are<br>
problems that an odor is generated in the mastication or the like, and a freeze<br>
resistance is poor in such an area that ambient temperature becomes not higher<br>
than 10Â°C in winter season. Furthermore, it can not be said that these<br>
techniques develop the sufficient improving effects.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
[0032] The modified natural rubber according to the first to third aspects of<br>
the invention is obtained by adding a polar-group-containing monomer to natural<br>
rubber latex and further adding a polymerization initiator and conducting an<br>
emulsion polymerization and then coagulating and drying the resulting polymer.<br>
Thus, a small amount of the polar group-containing monomer is graft-<br>
polymerized (emulsion-polymerized) to the natural rubber latex, so that the<br>
physical properties inherent to natural rubber are sufficiently maintained without<br>
deteriorating the processability and the reinforcing property and affinity to a<br>
filler can be improved. Also, the monomer to be graft-polymerized has a polar<br>
group, so that odor produced in the mastication or the like can be decreased.<br><br><br>
Because, it is guessed that a substance causing the odor is caught by the polar<br>
group to bring about the decrease of the odor. Furthermore, the graft<br>
polymerization of the polar group-containing monomer to the molecule of the<br>
natural rubber somewhat changes the steric structure of the natural rubber<br>
molecule to largely delay the static crystallization rate and hence the freeze<br>
resistance in the storing at a low-temperature area can be considerably improved.<br>
Moreover, when such a modified natural rubber is compounded with a filler such<br>
as carbon black, silica or the like to form a rubber composition, the properties<br>
such as loss factor, wear resistance and the like can be considerably improved.<br>
[0033] The natural rubber latex used in the invention is an ordinary latex and<br>

peroxide, cummene hydroperoxide, tert-butyl hydroperoxide, di-tert-butyl<br>
peroxide, 2,2-azobisisobutylonitrile, 2,2-azobis(2-diaminopropane)hydrochloride,<br><br><br>
2,2-azobis(2-diaminopropane)dihydrochloride, 2,2-azobis(2,4-dimethyl-<br>
valeronitrile), potassium persulfate, sodium persulfate, ammonium persulfate and<br>
so on. Moreover, it is preferable to use a redox type polymerization initiator for<br>
lowering the polymerization temperature. As a reducing agent to be combined<br>
with a peroxide used in the redox type polymerization initiator are mentioned<br>
tetraethylene pentamine, mercaptanes, acidic sodium sulfite, reducing metal ion,<br>
ascorbic acid and so on. Particularly, a combination of tert-butyl hydroperoxide<br>
and tetraethylene pentamine is preferable as the redox type polymerization initiator.<br>
[0048] The graft polymerization according to the invention is a usual<br>
emulsion polymerization wherein the polar group-containing monomer is added<br>
to natural rubber latex and polymerized at a given temperature with stirring.<br>
In this case, the polar group-containing monomer is previously added with water<br>
and an emulsifying agent and sufficiently emulsified and added to the natural<br>
rubber latex, or the polar group-containing monomer is directly added to natural<br>
rubber latex and an emulsifying agent may be added before or after the addition<br>
of the polar group-containing monomer, if necessary. The emulsifying agent is<br>
not particularly limited and includes, for example, a nonionic surfactant such as<br>
polyoxyethylene lauryl ether or the like.<br>
[0049] Considering that the freeze resistance and odor reduction are improved<br>
while maintaining the physical properties inherent to natural rubber, or considering<br>
that the loss factor and wear resistance are improved without deteriorating the<br>
processability in the compounding with carbon black or silica, it is important to<br>
evenly introduce a small amount of the polar group into the natural rubber<br>
molecule. For this end, an amount of the polymerization initiator added is<br>
preferably 1-100 mol%, more preferably 10-100 mol% per 100 mol of the polar<br>
group-containing monomer. The aforementioned components are charged into a<br>
reaction vessel and graft-polymerized at 30-80Â°C for 10 minutes to 7 hours to<br>
obtain a modified natural rubber latex. The thus obtained modified natural<br>
rubber latex is further coagulated and washed and dried by using a drying<br>
machine such as vacuum drier, air drier, drum drier or the like to obtain a<br>
modified natural rubber.<br>
[0050] In the modified natural rubber according to the invention, a grafting<br>
ratio of the polar group-containing monomer is preferably 0.01-5% by mass,<br><br><br>
more preferably 0.1-3.0% by mass, most preferably 0.2-1% by mass based on a<br>
rubber component of the natural rubber latex. When the grafting ratio of the<br>
polar group-containing monomer is less than 0.01% by mass, there is a fear that<br>
the effect of improving the odor reduction or the freeze resistance in the storing<br>
is not sufficiently obtained or the effect of improving the loss factor and wear<br>
resistance in the rubber composition is not sufficiently obtained. While, when<br>
the grafting ratio exceeds 5% by mass, the physical properties inherent to natural<br>
rubber (viscoelasticity, stress-strain curve in a tensile test or the like) is largely<br>
changed and hence the conventional methods making the beat use of the physical<br>
properties inherent to natural rubber can not be quite utilized and also there is a<br>
fear that the processability is largely deteriorated.<br>
[0051] The rubber composition according to the third aspect of the invention<br>
comprises the above modified natural rubber as a rubber component. In this<br>
case, it is preferable that the content of the modified natural rubber is at least<br>
15% by mass. When the content is less than 15% by mass, there is a fear that<br>
the effect of improving the loss factor and wear resistance as the rubber<br>
composition is not obtained.<br>
[0052] As a rubber component used together with the modified natural rubber<br>
are mentioned usual natural rubber and diene-based synthetic rubbers. As the<br>
diene-based synthetic rubber, there are styrene-butadiene copolymer (SBR),<br>
polybutadiene (BR), polyisoprene (IR), butyl rubber (IIR), ethylene-propylene<br>
copolymer and a mixture thereof.<br>
[0053] Further, the rubber composition contains carbon black and/or silica as<br>
a filler. An amount of the filler compounded is 30-120 parts by mass based on<br>
100 parts by mass of the rubber component. When the amount is less than<br>
30 parts by mass, the effect of improving the reinforcing property and other<br>
properties is not sufficiently developed, while when it exceeds 120 parts by mass,<br>
the processability lowers.<br>
[0054] As the carbon black can be used all of commercially available ones.<br>
Among them, it is preferable to use carbon blacks of SAF, ISAF, HAF, FEF and<br>
GPF grades. As the silica can be used all of commercially available ones.<br>
Among them, it is preferable to use wet silica, dry silica or colloidal silica.<br>
Particularly, silica is preferable to have a BET of not less than 150 m2/g, more<br><br><br>
preferably not less than 170 m2/g, most preferably not less than 190 m2/g.<br>
As the silica satisfying such a requirement, there are commercially available<br>
products such as Nipsil AQ, Nipsil KQ and the like.<br>
[0055] The rubber composition can be properly compounded with the<br>
additives usually used in the rubber industry such as other reinforcing filler,<br>
vulcanizing agent, vulcanization accelerator, antioxidant, softening agent and the<br>
like, if necessary.<br>
[0056] Further, the fourth aspect of the invention lies in a pneumatic tire<br>
applying the above rubber composition to a tire constituting member. Since the<br>
rubber composition according to the third aspect of the invention considerably<br>
improves the properties such as loss factor, wear resistance and the like as<br>
previously mentioned, it is particularly preferable to use such a rubber<br>
composition in a tire tread.<br>
[0057] The modified natural rubber latex according to the fifth aspect of the<br>
invention is obtained by adding a tin-containing monomer to the natural rubber<br>
latex and further adding the polymerization initiator to conduct emulsion<br>
polymerization. Also, the modified natural rubber according to the sixth aspect<br>
of the invention is obtained by coagulating and drying the thus obtained polymer<br>
product. In the modified natural rubber obtained by introducing the tin-<br>
containing monomer into the natural rubber molecule, the reinforcing property<br>
and affinity to carbon black are largely improved and hence the effect of<br>
considerably improving the loss factor and wear resistance is developed in the<br>
rubber composition compounded with carbon black.<br>
[0058] The natural rubber latex and polymerization initiator used in the fifth<br>
and sixth aspects are the same as previously mentioned.<br>
[0059] As the tin-containing monomer, mention may be made of allyl tri-n-<br>
butyl tin, allyl trimethyl tin, allyl triphenyl tin, allyl tri-n-octyl tin, (meth)acryloxy<br>
n-butyl tin, (meth)acryloxy trimethyl tin, (meth)acryloxy triphenyl tin,<br>
(meth)acryloxy n-octyl tin, vinyl tri-n-butyl tin, vinyl trimethyl tin, vinyl<br>
triphenyl tin, vinyl tri-n-octyl tin and so on. These tin-containing monomers<br>
may be used alone or in a combination of two or more.<br>
[0060] The above graft polymerization is a usual emulsion polymerization<br>
wherein the tin-containing monomer is added to the natural rubber latex and<br><br><br>
polymerized at a given temperature with stirring. In this case, the tin-containing<br>
monomer is previously added with water and an emulsifying agent and<br>
sufficiently emulsified and added to the natural rubber latex, or the tin-containing<br>
monomer is directly added to natural rubber latex and an emulsifying agent may<br>
be added before or after the addition of the tin-containing monomer, if necessary.<br>
The emulsifying agent is not particularly limited and includes, for example, a<br>
nonionic surfactant such as polyoxyethylene lauryl ether or the like.<br>
[0061] Considering that the modified natural rubber is compounded with<br>
carbon black to form a rubber composition improving the loss factor and wear<br>
resistance without deteriorating the processability, it is important to evenly<br>
introduce a small amount of a polar group in the tin-containing monomer into the<br>
natural rubber molecule. For this end, an amount of the polymerization initiator<br>
added is preferably 1-100 mol%, more preferably 10-100 mol% per 100 mol of<br>
the tin-containing monomer. The aforementioned components are charged into<br>
a reaction vessel and graft-polymerized at 30-80Â°C for 10 minutes to 7 hours to<br>
obtain a modified natural rubber latex. The thus obtained modified natural<br>
rubber latex may be used at a latex state as it is, or may be used at a solid state<br>
after the coagulation and drying. In case of applying to the rubber composition,<br>
it is preferable to use as a solid rubber. In case of the solid rubber, the rubber<br>
latex is first coagulated and washed and then dried by using a drying machine<br>
such as vacuum drier, air drier, drum drier or the like.<br>
[0062] In the modified natural rubber latex and the modified natural rubber<br>
according to the fifth and sixth aspects of the invention, a grafting ratio of the<br>
tin-containing monomer is preferable to be 0.01-10% by mass based on a rubber<br>
component of the natural rubber latex. When the grafting ratio of the tin-<br>
containing monomer is less than 0.01% by mass, there is a fear that the effect of<br>
improving the loss factor and wear resistance as the rubber composition is not<br>
sufficiently obtained. While, when the grafting ratio exceeds 10% by mass, the<br>
physical properties inherent to natural rubber (viscoelasticity, stress-strain curve<br>
in a tensile test or the like) is largely changed and hence the conventional<br>
methods making the beat use of the physical properties inherent to natural rubber<br>
can not be quite utilized and also there is a fear that the processability is largely<br>
deteriorated.<br><br><br>
[0063] When the above modified natural rubber is compounded with carbon<br>
black to prepare a rubber composition, the reinforcing property and affinity to<br>
carbon black are improved as compared with those in the conventional rubber<br>
composition comprising non-modified natural rubber and carbon black and hence<br>
the loss factor and wear resistance are considerably improved. Moreover, all of<br>
commercially available carbon blacks can be used. Among them, it is<br>
preferable to use carbon blacks of SAF, ISAF, HAF, FEF and GPF grades.<br>
[0064] The rubber composition according to the eighth aspect of the<br>
invention may be properly compounded with the additives usually used in the<br>
rubber industry such as other reinforcing filler, vulcanizing agent, vulcanization<br>
accelerator, antioxidant, softening agent and the like, if necessary.<br>
[0065] The modified natural rubber latex according to the ninth aspect of the<br>
invention is obtained by adding an alkoxysilyl group-containing monomer to the<br>
natural rubber latex and further adding the polymerization initiator to conduct<br>
emulsion polymerization. Also, the modified natural rubber according to the<br>
tenth aspect of the invention is obtained by coagulating and drying the thus<br>
obtained polymer product. In the modified natural rubber obtained by<br>
introducing the alkoxysilyl group-containing monomer into the natural rubber<br>
molecule, the reinforcing property and affinity to silica are largely improved and<br>
hence the effect of considerably improving the loss factor and wear resistance is<br>
developed in the rubber composition compounded with silica.<br>
[0066] The natural rubber latex and polymerization initiator used in the ninth<br>
and tenth aspects are the same as previously mentioned.<br>
[0067] As the alkoxysilyl group-containing monomer, mention may be made<br>
of (meth)acryloxymethyl trimethoxysilane, (meth)acryloxymethyl<br>
methyldimethoxysilane, (meth)acryloxymethyl dimethylmethox ysilane,<br>
(meth)acryloxymethyl triethoxysilane, (meth)acryloxymethyl<br>
methyldiethoxysilane, (meth)acryloxymethyl dimethylethoxysilane,<br>
(meth)acryloxymethyl tripropoxysilane, (meth)acryloxymethyl<br>
methyldipropoxysilane, (meth)acryloxymethyl dimethylpropoxysiiane, y-<br>
(meth)acryloxypropyl trimethoxysilane, Î³-(meth)acryloxypropyl<br>
methyldimethoxysilane, Î³-(meth)acryloxypropyl dimethylmethoxysilane, Î³-<br>
(meth)acryloxypropyl triethoxysilane, Î³-(meth)acryloxypropyl<br><br><br>
methyldiethoxysilane, Î³-(meth)acryloxypropyl dimethylethoxysilane, Î³-<br>
(meth)acryloxypropyl tripropoxysilane, Î³-(meth)acryloxypropyl<br>
methyldipropoxysilane, Î³-(meth)acryloxypropyl dimethylpropoxysilane, Î³-<br>
(meth)acryloxypropyl methyldiphenoxysilane, Î³-(meth)acryloxypropyl<br>
dimethylphenoxysilane, Î³-(meth)acryloxypropyl methyldibenzyloxysilane, Î³-<br>
(meth)acryloxypropyl dimethylbenzyloxysilane, trimethoxy vinylsilane, triethoxy<br>
vinylsilane, 6-trimethoxysilyl-l,2-hexene, p-trimethoxysilyl styrene and so on.<br>
These alkoxysilyl group-containing monomers may be used alone or in a<br>
combination of two or more,<br>
[0068] The above graft polymerization is a usual emulsion polymerization<br>
wherein the alkoxysilyl group-containing monomer is added to the natural rubber<br>
latex and polymerized at a given temperature with stirring. In this case, the<br>
alkoxysilyl group-containing monomer is previously added with water and an<br>
emulsifying agent and sufficiently emulsified and added to the natural rubber<br>
latex, or the alkoxysilyl group-containing monomer is directly added to natural<br>
rubber latex and an emulsifying agent may be added before or after the addition<br>
of the alkoxysilyl group-containing monomer, if necessary. The emulsifying<br>
agent is not particularly limited and includes, for example, a nonionic surfactant<br>
such as polyoxyethylene lauryl ether or the like.<br>
[0069] Considering that the modified natural rubber is compounded with<br>
silica to form a rubber composition improving the loss factor and wear resistance<br>
without deteriorating the processability, it is important to evenly introduce a<br>
small amount of a polar group in the alkoxysilyl group-containing monomer into<br>
the natural rubber molecule. For this end, an amount of the polymerization<br>
initiator added is preferably 1-100 mol%, more preferably 10-100 mol% per<br>
100 mol of the alkoxysilyl group-containing monomer. The aforementioned<br>
components are charged into a reaction vessel and graft-polymerized at 30-80Â°C<br>
for 10 minutes to 7 hours to obtain a modified natural rubber latex. The thus<br>
obtained modified natural rubber latex may be used at a latex state as it is, or may<br>
be used at a solid state after the coagulation and drying. In case of applying to<br>
the rubber composition, it is preferable to use as a solid rubber. In case of the<br>
solid rubber, the rubber latex is first coagulated and washed and then dried by<br>
using a drying machine such as vacuum drier, air drier, drum drier or the like.<br><br><br>
[0070] In the modified natural rubber latex and the modified natural rubber<br>
according to the ninth and tenth aspects of the invention, a grafting ratio of the<br>
alkoxysilyl group-containing monomer is preferable to be 0.01-10% by mass<br>
based on a rubber component of the natural rubber latex. When the grafting<br>
ratio of the alkoxysilyl group-containing monomer is less than 0.01% by mass,<br>
there is a fear that the effect of improving the loss factor and wear resistance as<br>
the rubber composition is not sufficiently obtained. While, when the grafting<br>
ratio exceeds 10% by mass, the physical properties inherent to natural rubber<br>
(viscoelasticity, stress-strain curve in a tensile test or the like) is largely changed<br>
and hence the conventional methods making the beat use of the physical<br>
properties inherent to natural rubber can not be quite utilized and also there is a<br>
fear that the processability is largely deteriorated.<br>
[0071] When the above modified natural rubber is compounded with silica to<br>
prepare a rubber composition, the reinforcing property and affinity to silica are<br>
improved as compared with those in the conventional rubber composition<br>
comprising non-modified natural rubber and silica and hence the loss factor and<br>
wear resistance are considerably improved. Moreover, all of commercially<br>
available silicas can be used. Among them, it is preferable to use wet silica, dry<br>
silica and colloidal silica.<br>
[0072] The rubber composition according to the fourteenth aspect of the<br>
invention may be properly compounded with the additives usually used in the<br>
rubber industry such as other reinforcing filler, vulcanizing agent, vulcanization<br>
accelerator, antioxidant, softening agent and the like, if necessary.<br>
[0073] The following examples are given in illustration of the invention and<br>
are not intended as limitations thereof.<br>
[0074] Production Example 1<br>
(1) Step of modifying natural rubber latex<br>
A field latex is subjected to a centrifugal separation with a latex<br>
separator (made by Saito Enshin Kogyo Co., Ltd.) at a revolution speed of<br>
7500 rpm to obtain a concentrated latex having a dry rubber concentration of<br>
60%. 1000 g of the concentrated latex is charged into a stainless reaction vessel<br>
provided with a stirrer and a temperature-regulated jacket, and an emulsion<br>
previously formed by adding 10 ml of water and 90 mg of an emulsifying agent<br><br>
(Emulgen 1108, made by Kao Corporation) to 30 g of N,N-diethylaminoethyl<br>
methacrylate is added together with 990 ml of water, and then stirred for<br>
30 minutes while bubbling with nitrogen. Then, 1.2 g of tert-butyl hydro-<br>
peroxide and 1.2 g of tetraethylene pentamine are added as a polymerization<br>
initiator to conduct reaction at 40Â°C for 30 minutes, whereby a modified natural<br>
rubber latex is obtained.<br>
[0075] (2) Step of coagulation and drying<br>
Then, the modified natural rubber latex is coagulated by adding<br>
formic acid to adjust pH to 4.7. The thus obtained solid matter is treated by a<br>
clapper 5 times and crumbed through a shredder and dried by a hot air drier at<br>
110Â°C for 210 minutes to obtain a modified natural rubber A. It is confirmed<br>
from the weight of the thus obtained modified natural rubber A that a conversion<br>
of N,N-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate as a polar group-containing monomer<br>
is 100%. Also, as the separation of a homopolymer is carried out by extracting<br>
the modified natural rubber A with a petroleum ether and further extracting with<br>
a 2:1 mixed solvent of acetone and methanol, it is confirmed that the<br>
homopolymer is not detected from the analysis of the extract and 100% of the<br>
monomer added is introduced into the natural rubber molecule. In this example,<br>
3.0 g of N,N-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate is added to 600 g of latex (60% of<br>
1000 g of the concentrated latex), so that the grafting ratio is 3.0/600 = 0.5%.<br>
[0076] Production Examples 2-8<br>
Modified natural rubbers B, C, D, E, F, G, H are obtained in the same<br>
manner as in Production Example 1 except that 2.1 g of 2-hydroxyethyl<br>
methacrylate in Production Example 2, 1.7 g of 4-vinylpyridine in Production<br>
Example 3, 2.1 g of itaconic acid in Production Example 4, 1.4 g of methacrylic<br>
acid in Production Example 5, 1.7 g of acrylonitrile in Production Example 6,<br>
2.3 g of glycidyl methacrylate in Production Example 7 and 2.8 g of<br>
methacrylamide in Production Example 8 are used instead of 3.0 g of N,N-<br>
diethylaminoethyl methacrylate, respectively. As the modified natural rubbers<br>
B-H are analyzed in the same manner as in Production Example 1, it is confirmed<br>
that 100% of the monomer added is introduced into the natural rubber molecule.<br>
[0077] Production Examples 9, 10<br>
Modified natural rubbers I, J are obtained in the same manner as in<br><br><br>
Production Example 1 except that the addition amount and kind of the polar<br>
group-containing monomer, amounts of the emulsifying agent and polymeriza-<br>
tion initiator and the reaction time are changed as shown in Table 1, respectively.<br>
As the modified natural rubbers I, J are analyzed in the same manner as in<br>
Production Example 1, it is conformed that a conversion of the monomer is<br>
98.2% in the modified natural rubber I and 98.7% in the modified natural rubber<br>
J, respectively. Also, as the amount of homopolymer is analyzed by extraction,<br>
it is confirmed to be 4.8% of the monomer in the modified natural rubber I and<br>
4.1% of the monomer in the modified natural rubber J, respectively.<br>
[0078] Production Example 11<br>
A solid natural rubber K is obtained by directly coagulating and<br>
drying natural rubber latex without modification.<br>
[0079] Production Examples 12-15<br>
Modified natural rubbers L, M, N are obtained in the same manner as<br>
in Production Example 1 except that 3.0 g of N,N-dimethylvinyl benzylamine in<br>
Production Example 12, 3.0 g of N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) methacrylamide in<br>
Production Example 13, 3.0 g of N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) acrylamide in<br>
Production Example 14 and 1.7 g of 2-vinylpyridine in Production Example 15<br>
are used instead of 3.0 g of N,N-diethylaminoethyl methacrylate, respectively.<br>
As the modified natural rubbers L-N are analyzed in the same manner as in<br>
Production Example 1, it is confirmed that 100% of the monomer added is<br>
introduced into the natural rubber molecule.<br><br><br>
[0081] Examples 1-12, Comparative Examples 1-3<br>
With respect to the modified natural rubbers A-O of Production<br>
Examples 1-15, the hardness and odor concentration are measured by the<br>
following methods to obtain results as shown in Table 2.<br>
[0082] The hardness is measured according to JIS K6253 (1997) after each of<br>
the modified natural rubbers is kept in a refrigerator of 5Â°C for 84 hours or in air<br>
of 24Â°C for 48 hours.<br>
[0083] The odor concentration is measured as follows. At first, each<br>
modified natural rubber is masticated, and at a time of reaching a masticating<br>
temperature to 140Â°C, an odor gas is gathered from an discharge port of a mixing<br>
machine into a tedlar bag through a pump. Then, a regulated amount of air<br>
having no odor is charged into a sampling bag through a pump and sealed with a<br>
stopper, and a given amount of odor gas sample is taken out from the tedlar bag<br><br><br>
through an injection syringe and poured into the sampling bag to obtain a diluted<br>
odor gas sample. The odor of the diluted odor gas sample is smelled by four<br>
panelists to measure a multiple of dilution until the odor is not feelingly smelled<br>
and an average value thereof is calculated. The odor concentration is evaluated<br>
by the average value of the dilution multiple, in which the smaller the value, the<br>
lower the odor.<br><br><br><br>
[0085] Examples 13-40, Comparative Examples 4-5<br>
A rubber composition is prepared by using the modified natural<br>
rubbers A-J and L-0 obtained in Production Examples 1-10 and 12-15,<br>
respectively, according to a compounding recipe I or II shown in Table 3.<br>
For the comparison, a rubber composition is prepared by using the natural rubber<br>
K of Production Example 11 according to the same compounding recipe.<br>
[0086] With respect to these rubber compositions is measured a Mooney<br>
viscosity (ML1+4, 130Â°C). Further, the properties of a vulcanizate such as<br>
tensile strength (MPa), loss factor (tan 6, 50Â°C) and wear resistance (represented<br>
by an index on the basis that Comparative Example 4 or 5 is 100) are measured<br>
after the rubber composition of the compounding recipe I is vulcanized at 145Â°C<br>
for 33 minutes and the rubber composition of the compounding recipe II is<br>
vulcanized at 160Â°C for 15 minutes. The measured results are shown in Table 4.<br>
[0087] Moreover, the measuring method of each property is as follows.<br>
[0088] (1) The Mooney viscosity of the rubber composition (ML1+4, 130Â°C)<br>
is measured according to JIS K6300-1994.<br>
[0089] (2) Tensile strength<br>
A strength at break (Tb) is measured according to JIS K6301-1995.<br>
[0090] (3) tan Î´<br>
A value of tan Î´ is measured by using a viscoelasticity measuring<br>
device (made by Rheometrix Corporation) under conditions that a temperature is<br>
50Â°C, a strain is 5% and a frequency is 15 Hz. The smaller the value, the lower<br>
the loss factor.<br>
[0091] (4) Wear resistance<br>
The wear resistance is evaluated by measuring a worn amount at a slip<br>
ratio of 60% and room temperature by means of a Lambourn abrasion tester and<br>
represented by an index on the basis that Comparative Example 4 or 5 is 100.<br>
The larger the index value, the better the wear resistance.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
[0094] Production Example 16<br>
(1) Step of modifying natural rubber latex<br>
A field latex is subjected to a centrifugal separation with a latex<br>
separator (made by Saito Enshin Kogyo Co., Ltd.) at a revolution speed of<br>
7500 rpm to obtain a concentrated latex having a dry rubber concentration of<br>
60%. 1000 g of the concentrated latex is charged into a stainless reaction vessel<br>
provided with a stirrer and a temperature-regulated jacket, and an emulsion<br>
previously formed by adding 10 ml of water and 0.21 g of an emulsifying agent<br>
(Emulgen 1108, made by Kao Corporation) to 5 g of allyl tri-n-butyl tin is added<br>
together with 990 ml of water, and then stirred at room temperature for 30 minutes<br>
while bubbling with nitrogen. Then, 1.2 g of tert-butyl hydroperoxide and 1.2 g<br>
of tetraethylene pentamine are added as a polymerization initiator to conduct<br>
reaction at 40Â°C for 30 minutes, whereby a modified natural rubber latex is<br>
obtained.<br>
[0095] (2) Step of coagulation and drying<br>
Then, the modified natural rubber latex is coagulated by adding<br>
formic acid to adjust pH to 4.7. The thus obtained solid matter is treated by a<br>
clapper 5 times and crumbed through a shredder and dried by a hot air drier at<br>
110Â°C for 210 minutes to obtain a modified natural rubber P. It is confirmed<br>
from the weight of the thus obtained modified natural rubber P that a conversion<br>
of allyl tri-n-butyl tin as a tin-containing monomer is 100%. Also, as the<br>
separation of a homopolymer is carried out by extracting the modified natural<br>
rubber P with a petroleum ether and further extracting with a 2:1 mixed solvent<br>
of acetone and methanol, it is confirmed that the homopolymer is not detected<br>
from the analysis of the extract and 100% of the monomer added is introduced<br>
into the natural rubber molecule.<br>
[0096] Production Examples 17-19<br>
Modified natural rubbers Q, R, S are obtained in the same manner as<br>
in Production Example 16 except that 7.3 g of allyl tri-n-octyl tin in Production<br>
Example 17, 6.0 g of acryloxy tri-n-butyl tin in Production Example 18, and<br>
5.2 g of vinyl tri-n-butyl tin in Production Example 19 are used instead of 5 g of<br>
allyl tri-n-butyl tin, respectively. As the modified natural rubbers Q-S are<br>
analyzed in the same manner as in Production Example 16, it is confirmed that<br><br>
100% of the monomer added is introduced into the natural rubber molecule.<br>
[0097] Production Example 20<br>
A solid natural rubber T is obtained by directly coagulating and<br>
drying natural rubber latex without modification.<br>
[0098] Examples 41-44, Comparative Example 6<br>
A rubber composition is prepared by using the modified natural<br>
rubbers Î²-S obtained in Production Examples 16-19, respectively, according to a<br>
compounding recipe shown in Table 5. For the comparison, a rubber composition<br>
is prepared by using the natural rubber T of Production Example 20 according to<br>
the same compounding recipe.<br>
[0099] Table 5<br><br>
[0100] With respect to these rubber compositions is measured a Mooney<br>
viscosity (ML1+4, 130Â°C). Further, the properties of a vulcanizate such as<br>
tensile strength (MPa), loss factor (tan 6, 50Â°C) and wear resistance (represented<br>
by an index on the basis that Comparative Example 6 is 100) are measured after<br>
the rubber composition is vulcanized at 145ÂºC for 33 minutes. The measured<br>
results are shown in Table 6.<br>
[0101] Moreover, the measuring method of each property is as follows.<br>
[0102] (1) The Mooney viscosity of the rubber composition (ML1+4, 130Â°C)<br>
is measured according to JIS K6300-1994.<br>
[0103] (2) Tensile strength<br>
A strength at break (Tb) is measured according to JIS K6301-1995.<br><br>
[0104] (3) tan 5<br>
A value of tan 6 is measured by using a viscoelasticity measuring<br>
device (made by Rheometrix Corporation) under conditions that a temperature is<br>
50Â°C, a strain is 5% and a frequency is 15 Hz. The smaller the value, the lower<br>
the loss factor.<br>
[0105] (4) Wear resistance<br>
The wear resistance is evaluated by measuring a worn amount at a slip<br>
ratio of 60% and room temperature by means of a Lambourn abrasion tester and<br>
represented by an index on the basis that Comparative Example. 6 is 100.<br>
The larger the index value, the better the wear resistance.<br>
[0106] Table 6<br><br>
[0107] As seen from the results of Table 6, the rubber compositions<br>
comprising the modified natural rubbers Î²-S of Examples 41-44 are superior in<br>
all of the tensile strength, loss factor (tan 5) and wear resistance to the rubber<br>
composition of Comparative Example 6.<br>
[0108] Production Example 21<br>
(1) Step of modifying natural rubber latex<br>
A field latex is subjected to a centrifugal separation with a latex<br>
separator (made by Saito Enshin Kogyo Co., Ltd.) at a revolution speed of<br>
7500 rpm to obtain a concentrated latex having a dry rubber concentration of 60%.<br>
1000 g of the concentrated latex is charged into a stainless reaction vessel provided<br>
with a stirrer and a temperature-regulated jacket, and 1000 ml of water, 0.19 g of<br>
an emulsifying agent (Emulgen 1108, made by Kao Corporation) and 4.1 g of Î³-<br>
methacryloxypropyl trimethoxy silane are added, and then stirred for 15 minutes<br>
while bubbling with nitrogen. Then, 1.2 g of tert-butyl hydroperoxide and 1.2 g<br><br>
of tetraethylene pentamine are added as a polymerization initiator to conduct<br>
reaction at 40Â°C for 30 minutes, whereby a modified natural rubber latex is<br>
obtained.<br>
[0109] (2) Step of coagulation and drying<br>
Then, the modified natural rubber latex is coagulated by adding<br>
formic acid to adjust pH to 4.7. The thus obtained solid matter is treated by a<br>
clapper 5 times and crumbed through a shredder and dried by a hot air drier at<br>
110Â°C for 210 minutes to obtain a modified natural rubber U. It is confirmed<br>
from the weight of the thus obtained modified natural rubber U that a conversion<br>
of Î³-methacryloxypropyl trimethoxy silane as an alkoxysilyl group-containing<br>
monomer is 100%. Also, as the separation of a homopolymer is carried out by<br>
extracting the modified natural rubber U with a petroleum ether and further<br>
extracting with a 2:1 mixed solvent of acetone and methanol, it is confirmed that<br>
the homopolymer is not detected from the analysis of the extract and 100% of the<br>
monomer added is introduced into the natural rubber molecule.<br>
[0110] Production Examples 22-24<br>
Modified natural rubbers V, W, X are obtained in the same manner as<br>
in Production Example 21 except that 2.4 g of vinyltrimethoxy isilane in<br>
Production Example 22, 3.1 g of vinyltriethoxy silane in Production Example 23,<br>
and 6.4 g of N-[2-(vinylbenzylamino)ethyl]-3-aminopropyl trimethoxy silane in<br>
Production Example 24 are used instead of 4.1 g of Î³-methacryloxypropyl<br>
trimethoxy silane, respectively. As the modified natural rubbers V-X are<br>
analyzed in the same manner as in Production Example 21, it is confirmed that<br>
100% of the monomer added is introduced into the natural rubber molecule.<br>
[0111] Production Example 25<br>
A solid natural rubber Y is obtained by directly coagulating and<br>
drying natural rubber latex without modification.<br>
[0112] Examples 45-48, Comparative Example 7<br>
A rubber composition is prepared by using the modified natural<br>
rubbers U-X obtained in Production Examples 21-24, respectively, according to a<br>
compounding recipe shown in Table 7. For the comparison, a rubber<br>
composition is prepared by using the natural rubber Y of Production Example 25<br>
according to the same compounding recipe.<br><br><br><br>
[0114] With respect to these rubber compositions is measured a Mooney<br>
viscosity (ML1+4, 130Â°C). Further, the properties of a vulcanizate such as<br>
tensile strength (MPa), loss factor (tan 5, 50Â° C) and wear resistance (represented<br>
by an index on the basis that Comparative Example 7 is 100) are measured after<br>
the rubber composition is vulcanized at 160Â°C for 15 minutes. The measured<br>
results are shown in Table 8.<br>
[0115] Moreover, the measuring method of each property is as follows.<br>
[0116] (1) The Mooney viscosity of the rubber composition (ML1+4, 130Â°C)<br>
is measured according to JIS K6300-1994.<br>
[0117] (2) Tensile strength<br>
A strength at break (Tb) is measured according to JIS K6301-1995.<br>
[0118] (3) tan 6<br>
A value of tan 6 is measured by using a viscoelasticity measuring<br>
device (made by Rheometrix Corporation) under conditions that a temperature is<br>
50Â°C, a strain is 5% and a frequency is 15 Hz. The smaller the value, the lower<br>
the loss factor.<br><br>
[0119] (4) Wear resistance<br>
The wear resistance is evaluated by measuring a worn amount at a slip<br>
ratio of 60% and room temperature by means of a Lambourn abrasion tester and<br>
represented by an index on the basis that Comparative Example 7 is 100.<br>
The larger the index value, the better the wear resistance.<br>
[0120] Table 8<br><br>
[0121] As seen from the results of Table 8, the rubber compositions<br>
comprising the modified natural rubbers U-X of Examples 45-48 are superior in<br>
all of the tensile strength, loss factor (tan 6) and wear resistance to the rubber<br>
composition of Comparative Example 7.<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
[0122] As mentioned above, the modified natural rubbers according to the<br>
first aspect of the invention develop the effect of considerably improving the<br>
odor reduction in the mastication and the freeze resistance in the storing while<br>
maintaining the physical properties inherent to natural rubber as compared with<br>
the conventional non-modified natural rubber and are excellent in the reinforcing<br>
property and affinity to the filler such as carbon black, silica or the like as<br>
compared with the conventional non-modified natural rubber. When such a<br>
modified natural rubber is used to form a rubber composition containing carbon<br>
black and/or silica, there is obtained the effect of considerably improving the loss<br>
factor and wear resistance of the rubber composition. Further, when such a<br>
rubber composition is applied to a tire constituting member of a pneumatic tire,<br>
there can be produced a tire having excellent loss factor and wear resistance.<br>
[0123] Also, the modified natural rubber latex and modified natural rubber<br>
according to the fifth and sixth aspects of the invention are excellent in the<br><br>
reinforcing property and affinity to carbon black as compared with the<br>
conventional non-modified natural rubber. Therefore, when such a modified<br>
natural rubber is used to form a rubber composition containing carbon black,<br>
there is obtained the effect of considerably improving the loss factor and wear<br>
resistance of the rubber composition.<br>
[0124] Furthermore, the modified natural rubber latex and modified natural<br>
rubber according to the tenth and eleventh aspects of the invention are excellent<br>
in the reinforcing property and affinity to silica as compared with the conventional<br>
non-modified natural rubber. Therefore, when such a modified natural<br>
rubber is used to form a rubber composition containing silica, there is obtained<br>
the effect of considerably improving the loss factor and wear resistance of the<br>
rubber composition.<br><br>
