COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10]<br>
"AIR GUIDE  STRUCTURE IN  FRONT BODY  PORTION  OF SCOOTER TYPE VEHICLE"<br><br><br>
HONDA GIKEN KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA, a corporation of Japan, having a place of business at 1-1, Minamiaoyarria 2-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan,<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br>
[Detailed Description of the Invention] [Technical Field to which the Invention Pertains] The present invention relates to an air guide structure in a front body portion of a scooter type vehicle and more particularly an air guide structure whereby, despite a reduction in size of a front cover, a cooling efficiency of a radiator disposed inside the front cover can be enhanced.<br><br>
[Prior Art]<br>
In Japanese Utility Model Laid Open No. 10236/1986 there is disclosed a structure wherein a space surrounded by a front cover and a rear cover (leg shield) is formed above a front wheel in a front body portion of a scooter type vehicle.  Further, a radiator and a cooling fan which overlaps a rear side of the radiator are accommodated within the said space.  According to this structure, outside air is introduced from an intake duct provided in a front side of the front cover, then after cooling the radiator forcibly with the cooling fan, warm air to be discharged is discharged to the exterior through an air discharge duct provided in a rear cover.  In this structure, a vertical size of an air inlet is shorter than that of the radiator, and an air discharge port is conducted sideways by an air guide member.<br><br>
[Problems to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
From the standpoint of slimming a vehicle body it is sometimes desired that the vehicle body be made as compact as possible by diminishing a forward projection of a front cover.  In the above conventional structure, however, since the radiator is located in front of the<br><br><br>
cooling fan and the width of the radiator is larger than the outside diameter of the cooling fan, it is impossible to diminish the forward projection of the front cover. Besides, since the vertical size of the air inlet is smaller than the vertical length of the radiator, the cooling efficiency is deteriorated as the distance between the radiator and the air inlet becomes shorter. Moreover, as to the structure on the air discharge side, it is necessary to form a hole in the rear cover and mount a separate air guide member to the hole. Consequently, the number of components used increases and it becomes difficult to make a design for the improvement of appearance. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to solve such problems.<br>
Means for Solving the Problems]<br>
For solving the above-mentioned problems, according to the present invention there is provided an air intake structure in a front body portion of a scooter type vehicle wherein a radiator and a cooling fan are accommodated within a front cover disposed above a front wheel of the vehicle and the radiator is cooled with air introduced from an air inlet formed in the front cover, characterized in that a cooling fan is disposed between<br>
4<br><br>
the air inlet and the radiator.<br>
In this structure, the air inlet may have a length almost equal to a vertical length of the radiator. Moreover, air discharge ports may be formed in a rear cover which covers the front cover from a rear side of a vehicle body, the air discharge ports being formed in air discharge surfaces of both side portions of the rear cover which air discharge surfaces orient sideways backward.  In this case, the air discharge ports may be formed vertically longer* than the air inlet.<br>
Further, a louver extending nearly horizontally may be provided in the air inlet so that a front end portion thereof projects from a front line of the front cover. Moreover, a radiator reservoir tank may be disposed at a front lower position of the radiator which is accommodated within the front cover. [0007]<br>
Further, a horn may be disposed in an upper space above the radiator within the front cover, and a headlight may be provided in a front side of a handlebar cover which is disposed above the front cover.<br><br><br>
[Effects of the Invention]<br>
In the present invention, since a cooling fan is disposed between the air inlet and the radiator, outside air which is introduced from the air inlet by the cooling fan cools the radiator.  In this case, since the cooling fan narrower in width than the radiator is positioned in front of the radiator, it is possible to diminish the forward projection of the front cover.  Besides, since the radiator is spaced apart from the air inlet, the cooling efficiency is not affected.  Thus, despite the front cover being reduced in size, it is possible to keep high the radiator cooling efficiency.<br>
In this connection, if the length of the air inlet is set almost equal to the vertical length of the radiator, it is possible to ensure a sufficient amount of air introduced and thereby enhance the radiator cooling efficiency. Moreover, if air discharge ports are formed in surface of both side portions of the rear cover which surfaces orient sideways backward, warm air to be discharged after cooling the radiator is discharged smoothly sideways backward and outward while being guided by the air discharge surfaces from the air discharge ports. Thus, since air is conducted by utilizing the<br><br><br>
surfaces of the rear cover which also serves as a design part without using any separate air guide member, not only an increase in the number of components used is prevented, but also the appearance can be improved. Besides, if the air discharge port is made longer than the air inlet, it is possible to improve the flowability of the discharged air and further enhance the cooling efficiency. <br>
Further, since a louver extending nearly horizonta1ly is provided in the air inlet so that a front end portion thereof projects from a front line of the front cover, the outside air intake efficiency is improved. Moreover, if a radiator reservoir tank of a relatively large capacity is disposed at a front lower position of the radiator mounted within the front cover, it can be accommodated in high space efficiency into the inside space of the front cover. Also in this point it is possible to attain the reduction in size of the front cover. <br>
Further, if a headlight, which is relatively large-sized, is disposed in a front side of a handlebar cover and a horn, which is a small-sized component, is disposed<br><br><br>
in a narrow space formed above the radiator within the front cover, not only the radiator, cooling fan, reservoir tank, and horn can be accommodated in high space efficiency within the front cover, but also these components, including the headlight, can be disposed in high space efficiency in the front portion of the vehicle body.<br><br>
According to the present invention there is provided an air guide structure<br>
in a front body portion of a scooter type vehicle wherein a radiator and a<br>
cooling fan are accommodated within a front cover disposed above a front<br>
wheel of the vehicle and the radiator is cooled with air introduced from an<br>
air inlet formed in the front cover, characterized in that a cooling fan is<br>
disposed between said air inlet and said radiator,  said air inlet has a<br>
vertical  length  almost  equal to  a vertical length  of said radiator,   air<br>
discharge ports are formed in a rear cover which covers said front cover<br>
from a rear side of a vehicle body, said air discharge ports are formed in air<br>
discharge  surfaces of both  side portions of said rear cover which  air<br>
discharge surfaces orient sideways backward, said air discharge ports are<br>
formed vertically longer than said air inlet, a radiator reservoir tank is<br>
disposed at a front lower position of the radiator accommodated within said<br>
front cover, said radiator reservoir tank is formed in laterally elongated<br>
shape which is along the lower surface of said radiator at a lower position<br>
than said air discharge ports.<br>

First, an outline will be given of an entire structure of a two-wheeled motor vehicle to which this embodiment is applied. As shown in Fig. 1, this two-wheeled motor vehicle is a scooter type vehicle which adopts a front wheel 1 and a rear wheel 2, both wheels being large in diameter. An upper portion of a front fork 3 is covered with a front cover 4 and a leg shield 5 from front and behind. An air inlet 6 for introducing air for cooling a radiator is formed centrally of a front side of the front cover 4 and a pair of winkers 7 are provided on the right and left sides, respectively, of the air inlet 6.  Further, air discharge ports 8 for discharging warm air after cooling the radiator to the exterior are formed on both right and left sides of the leg shield 5.<br><br>
The front cover 4 is composed of a body portion 4a positioned above the front wheel 1 and a front side cover 4b, the front side cover 4b being connected to a lower portion of the body portion 4a and extending obliquely downward and backward behind the front wheel 1. Above the<br><br>
front cover 4 and the leg shield 5 is provided a handlebar cover 10 which covers a handlebar 9, and a headlight 11 is mounted in a front side of the handlebar cover 10.  Further, a meter panel 10a is provided on a rear side of an upper surface of the handlebar cover 10 (Fig. 2).<br>
A lower portion of the leg shield 5 is connected to a floor panel 12 which covers a step floor of a low type. The floor panel 12 is bent nearly horizontally at a somewhat lower position from the connection with the leg shield 5 and extends backward, providing a step floor surface for putting thereon of rider's feet. A rear portion of the floor panel 12 is connected to a rear cover 13 which rises upward from the floor surface.<br>
The rear cover 13 is a vertically open member which covers the space between a seat 14 and front and upper portions of the rear wheel 2. The upper opening of the rear cover 13 is covered with the seat 14 so that it can be opened and closed.  The seat 14 is a twin seat and is provided with a front seat 14a for a rider and a rear seat 14b for a passenger. A combined grab rail and carrier 33a extends backward from both right and left<br><br>

A front portion 13a of the rear cover is the largest in vertical width from the floor surface up to the front seat 14a, and a maintenance lid 15 is attached to a lower portion of the front portion 13a so as to cover a maintenance hole removably, the maintenance hole being formed so as to extend curvilinearly from the front side to both right and left sides.<br><br>
Step floor side faces located lower than the floor panel 12 are covered with lower covers 16, and front end portions thereof are connected to rear end portions of the front cover 4, while upper portions thereof are connected to the floor panel 12. For convenience sake, the front cover 4, the leg shield 5, and the handlebar cover 10 are generically designated a front body cover, the floor panel 12 and the lower covers 16 are generically designated a floor cover, and the rear cover 13 is designated a rear body cover.  Further, all of these<br><br><br>
covers are generically designated a body cover.  These body cover portions are appearance members and are each formed of a suitable material such as a plastic material.<br><br>
The maintenance lid 15 is formed of a suitable material such as a plastic material and is generally L-shaped in side view. Mounting and removal of the maintenance lid 15 result in closing and opening of a maintenance hole formed on the front portion 13a side of the rear cover and at the same time result in closing and opening of a maintenance hole (not shown) provided on the floor side which maintenance hole is formed in the floor panel 12 formed with a generally horizontal bottom portion. Right and left rear end portions of the floor panel 12 extend backward sideways of the front portion 13a of the rear cover, forming extension ends 12a which extend obliquely upward.  Pillion steps 17 for a passenger are adapted to lap on the extension ends 12a when stowed. <br>
Flat surfaces 18 are formed on side faces of the rear cover 13 and at positions below the front seat 14a and above the pillion steps 17, and a large-sized tail light unit 19 is attached to a rear end portion of the rear cover 13 so as to extend curvilinearly up to side<br><br>
faces of the rear cover. A seat locking key hole 20 is formed in a side face of the rear cover 13 at a position near the tail light unit 19 and above the rear wheel 2. In the figures, the reference numeral 21 denotes a swing type power unit, numeral 22 denotes an air cleaner, numeral 23 denotes a rear cushion, and numeral 24 denotes a main stand.<br>
The swing type power unit 21 is provided with a four-cycle engine to be described later and a V belt type transmission. The numeral 21a in the figures denotes a crank shaft, on which is mounted a driving pulley coaxially. Numeral 21b denotes a transmission output shaft, on which are mounted a driven pulley and a starting clutch coaxially. Numeral 21c denotes a V belt entrained on both driving pulley and driven pulley and extending therebetween, and numeral 21d denotes an axle of the rear wheel.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, a head pipe 26 is provided at a front end portion of a body frame 25 and a steering shaft 27 is supported rotatably by the head pipe 26. The front fork 3 and the handlebar 9 are connected with each other through the steering shaft 27.  Further, as shown in Fig.<br><br><br>
4, the swing type power unit 21 is supported at a central part of the body frame 25 swingably through a link mechanism 28.<br>
As  shown  also in  Figs.   8  and  9,    the body frame 25 comprises a down portion 30 extending obliquely downward and backward centrally of the vehicle body from the head pipe 26, a pair of right and left floor portions 31 whose front ends are welded to both sides of a lower portion of the down portion 30, the floor portions 31 extending obliquely downward and backward, then being bent nearly horizontally and further extending backward, pillar portions 32 which are bent from rear ends of the floor portions 31 and which extend upward in front of the rear wheel 2, and seat rail portions 33 whose upper ends are welded to the pillar portions 32 and which extend obliquely upward and backward below the seat 14 and above the rear wheel 2. <br>
The down portion 30 is a single pipe member.  The floor portions 31 and the pillar portions 32 are contiguous pipe members, which are each provided in a pair right and left. The seat  rail portions 33, which  are provided in a pair right and left, are connected with<br><br>
each other through an overhanging portion 34 which extends forward of the vehicle body from upper ends of the pillar portions 32 so as to be bent convexly to the front side. That is, the seat rail portions 33 are formed as portions of a single pipe member which is generally U-shaped in plan. The right and left seat rail portions 33 are connected together on their rear sides by means of a • cross member 35.  Pivot plates 36 are provided respectively in the connections between the seat rails 33 and the pillar portions 32 and pivot portions 36a are provided on the pivot plates 36 respectively. With the pivot portions 36a, one end side of the link mechanism 28 is journaled, which link mechanism, on the other side thereof, supports the swing type power unit 21. <br>
The rear ends of the right and left floor portions 31 are curved in a backwardly convex shape and are then connected together through a cross pipe 38. Both sides of the cross pipe 38 are welded to rear end undersides of the right and left floor portions 31.  Further, side stays 39 extend outside and sideways of the right and left floor portions 31 longitudinally and nearly in parallel with the floor portions.  The side stays 39 are connected to the corresponding floor portions 31 each through stays<br><br>
40a and 40b. Front ends of step frames 41 are clamped respectively to the stays 40b which are located on the rear side.<br>
The step frames 41 are pipe members which are curved obliquely backward and upwardly convexly along lower portions of the right and left pillar portion 32 respectively.  The opposite end sides of the step frames 41 are attached from behind to brackets 32a (Figs. 7 and 10) which are secured to rear sides of the pillar portions 32. At uppermost tops of the step frames 41 are provided mounting bosses 42 for the pillion steps.<br>
The front ends of the right and left floor portions 31 are also interconnected with a front cross pipe 37, and a lower end of the down portion 30 is welded to an intermediate position of the front cross pipe 37.  In this way there is formed an underfloor space which is surrounded by the right and left floor portions 31 and front and rear cross pipes 37, 38. <br>
Again with reference to Figs. 3 to 6, a description will now be given about a layout relation between the body frame 25 and various components.  The head pipe 26 is<br><br>
accommodated in the space surrounded by the front cover 4 and the leg shield 5.  In front of the head pipe 26, a radiator 43 is disposed, and in front of the radiator 43, a cooling fan 44 is disposed.  Further, a radiator reservoir tank 45 is disposed at a lower position with respect to the cooling fan 44, and a horn 46 is disposed above the radiator 43.<br>
The down portion 30 is disposed behind the front wheel 1 and between the front cover 4 and the leg shield 5.  The floor portions 31 and the side stays 39 are covered with the floor panel 12 and the lower covers 16. A recess 48 of a tray 47 sown in Fig. 10 is accommodated within the underfloor space defined by the right and left floor portions 31 and the front and rear cross pipes 37, 38, and associated electric components such as a battery 49a and a starter relay 49b are received within the recess 48. <br>
The floor tray 47 is formed of a suitable material such as a plastic material and is supported at peripheral portions of the recess 48 by the right and left floor portions 31 and the front and rear cross pipes 37, 38. Further, an opening formed above the recess 48 faces a<br><br>
maintenance hole formed in the floor panel 12 and is opened and closed by the bottom of the maintenance lid 15.<br>
The step frames 42 are covered with the extension ends 12a of the floor panel 12, and the bosses 42 and the pillion steps 17 extend to the exterior through apertures formed in the extension ends 12a (Fig. 2) .<br><br>
The swing type power unit 21 supported by the pivot plates 36 is provided at a front portion thereof with a water-cooled four-cycle engine. As is seen in Fig. 7, the engine is provided with a cylinder 50, a cylinder head 51, and a cylinder head cover 52 and is disposed nearly horizontally.  The cylinder head cover 52, the cylinder head 51, a spark plug 53 attached to a side face of the cylinder head 51, and a part of a carburetor 54 connected to an intake port of the cylinder head 51, face the opening of a maintenance hole which is covered with the maintenance lid 15.<br><br>
The air cleaner 22 introduces the outside air through a duct 22a projecting forward from a front portion of the air cleaner 22 and supplies clean air to the carburetor 54 through a connecting tube 22b. An<br><br>
exhaust pipe 55, which is connected at one end thereof to an exhaust port of the cylinder head 51, passes below the engine and is connected at the opposite end thereof to a muffler 56 mounted sideways of the rear wheel (Fig. 4). Further, as shown in Fig. 2, the engine side and the radiator 43 are connected with each other through water feed pipes 57a and 57b which are offset to the right-hand side of the vehicle body, allowing cooling water to circulate.<br>
As shown in Fig. 4, the overhanging portion 34 projects forward to about the same extent as the cylinder head cover 52 and a goods container 58 is carried on both overhanging portion 34 and front halves of the seat rail portions 33.  Behind the goods container 58 a fuel tank 59 is supported on latter halves of the seat rail portions 33.  Further, upper ends of the rear cushion 23 are secured to the seat rail portions 33 at positions close to a longitudinally intermediate portion of the fuel tank 59.<br>

The following description is now provided about the structure of the radiator and the vicinity thereof.  Fig. 11 is an enlarged side view of the front cover 4 and the<br><br>
leg shield 5, Fig. 12 is a plan view thereof, Fig. 13 is a view as seen obliquely from the front side of the front cover 4, an upper portion of the front cover being cut¬away, Fig. 14 is a perspective view showing a components layout structure in the vicinity of the radiator 43 which is accommodated inside the front cover 4 and the leg shield 5, Fig. 15 is a side view thereof, and Fig. 16 is a plan view thereof.<br>
In Figs. 11 to 13, the front cover 4 is vertically divided at a vertically intermediate portion thereof. An upper portion thereof, when seen in side view, is in a generally triangular shape whose lower portion is convex forward and which is tapered upward.  Also when seen in plan view, the upper portion is in a generally triangular shape which is tapered forward convexly. As a result, the space (hereinafter referred to as "space 60" (Fig. 13) formed inside the front cover) formed between the front cover 4 and the leg shield 5 and in front of the head pipe 26 is wide on its lower rear side and becomes narrower forwards and upwards.<br>
The air inlet 6 provided in front of the air discharge ports 8 is open on the right and left sides of<br><br>
1<br><br>
a partition 6a which extends centrally and vertically.  In each such opening are formed plural louvers 61 in parallel with each other.  Each louver 61 projects forward nearly in parallel so that a front end thereof projects from a general surface (corresponding to the surface of the partition 6a) of the air inlet 6 as a front line of the front cover 4 (Fig. 11).<br>
A vertical length L1 of the air inlet 6 is almost equal to a vertical length L2 of the radiator 43 (Fig. 11) and a transverse width w thereof is also about the same as that of the radiator 43. When seen from the front side, the air inlet 6 is disposed at a position where it laps on the cooling fan 44 and the radiator 43 (Fig. 13). The radiator reservoir tank 45 disposed at a front lower position with respect to the cooling fan 44 is installed so as to be laterally long at a central part neat the bottom of the space 60 formed inside the front cover (Figs. 11 and 12). This is for preventing the tank 45 from obstructing the air inlet 6. <br>
A horn 46 is disposed at an upper central position of the radiator 43.  The horn 46 projects to a higher position than the radiator 43. When seen in side vi<br><br>
the horn 46, radiator 43, cooling fan 44, and radiator reservoir tank 45 are successively arranged in steps from a rear upper position to a front lower position.  The air inlet 6 is disposed slantwise in proximity to upper portions of those components (Fig. 11) .<br>
The air discharge ports 8, which are provided right and left behind the air inlet 6, are formed in an air discharge surface 62 which is formed vertically long along a joint portion with the front cover 4 and which is generally flat and inclined orienting obliquely backward and sideways.  The air discharge ports 8 are formed in both side positions of the front portion of the leg shield 5 which laps on the head pipe 26 in side view behind the radiator 43 to discharge warm air from the radiator. A vertical length L3 of the air discharge ports 8 is sufficiently large, projecting to a larger extent than the vertical lengths L1 and L2 of the air inlets 6 and the radiator 43.<br>
The air discharge ports 8 are open obliquely backward and outwardly sideways and are provided with plural louvers 63.  Inside the air discharge surface 62, air guide members 64 are disposed, as shown in Fig. 13.<br><br>
The air guide members 64 are formed of a plastic material for example and have an open shape corresponding to the air discharge ports 8, with plural louvers 65 provided therein. The air guide members 64 are mounted to inner surfaces of the air discharge ports 8 in the leg shield 5 through mounting portions 66 thereof formed as peripheral portions.  Since the air discharge surfaces 62 orient outwardly sideways, it is possible to discharge air effectively.  In addition, the provision of the air guide members promotes a flow uniforming effect, whereby the cooling performance is further improved.<br><br>
As shown in Figs. 13 to 16, a bracket 26a is welded to an upper portion of a front side of the head pipe 26 and a bracket 70 is bolted to a lower portion of the head pipe front side. An upper portion of the radiator 43 is clamped to the brackets 26a with bolts 71 and a lower rear portion of the radiator is also secured to the bracket 70 at similar clamp portions 72 (Fig. 15).<br>
A rear guide plate 73 is formed vertically long along substantially the overall length of a front side of a straight portion of the head pipe 26 and is generally U-shaped in side view with right and left sides thereof<br><br>
being open outwardly sideways.  Both right and left side portions of a vertical wall 70a extending along the head pipe 26 provide air guide surfaces 73a which overhang outwardly sideways and which are inclined backward.  The air to be discharged, which has passed the radiator 43, is guided by the air guide surfaces 73a and flows quickly toward the air guide members 64 and the air discharge ports 8, from which the air is discharged to the exterior of the vehicle.<br>
Stays 74 which extend forward are provided at lower positions of the bracket 70 and side faces of the radiator reservoir tank 45 are secured to front ends of the stays 74 with screws 75 or the like.  Thus, both side faces of the radiator reservoir tank 45 are secured to the lower portion of the bracket 70 although the opposite side is not clear from the drawings. A lower rear side of the radiator reservoir tank 45 is positioned near a front end of a bottom bridge 76.  Caps 77 and 78 are fitted on upper portions of the radiator reservoir tank 45 and the radiator 43, respectively, and are communicated with each other through a tube 79. As the temperature of water in the radiator becomes high, cooling water flows through the tube 79 into the radiator reservoir tank 45, while<br><br>
when the water temperature drops, the cooling water returns to the radiator 43.<br>
The radiator reservoir tank 45 is located at lower and left-hand positions with respect to the cooling fan 44 to define an air passage for the cooling fan 44 and serves as a guide.  Thus, it is not necessary to use any-special flow uniforming member as a separate member, permitting the reduction in size and in the number of components used. A winker 7 (Fig. 1) is present on the right-hand side of the cooling fan 44, so this winker also takes part in forming the air passage.<br>
The cooling fan 44 is of a size overlapping a front side of the radiator 43 (Figs. 15 and 16) and an upper portion thereof is secured to an upper portion of the radiator 43 with a bolt 80.  Though not clear in the drawings, a lower portion of the cooling fan 44 is also secured to a lower portion of the radiator 43 in the same manner. At an upper end of a fan cover 81 the tube 79 is fixed with clamps 82. <br>
Further, a drain tube 83 extends from near the cap 78 on the radiator reservoir tank 45.  The drain tube 83<br><br>
is guided and supported while extending approximately halfway round the upper half side of the fan cover 81. Outside air is introduced from the air inlet 6 and then the cooling fan 44 feeds the thus - introduced outside air to the radiator 43 located behind the air inlet to cool the radiator forcibly. As is seen in Fig. 16, the horn 46 is attached with a screw 85 or the like to a stay 84 which is integral with the bracket 26a.<br>
The operation of this embodiment will now be described.  Since the cooling fan 44 is disposed between the air inlet 6 and the radiator 43, the outside air introduced from the air inlet 6 by the cooling fan 44 cools the radiator 43, then the air which has become warm is guided by the air guide surface 73 and is discharged backward and outwardly sideways from the air discharge ports 8.  Further, the discharged air is guided by the air discharge surface 62 and flows outwardly sideways.<br>
At this time, since the cooling fan 44 smaller in width than the radiator 43 is positioned in front of the radiator 43, it is possible to diminish the forward projection of the front cover 4. Besides, since the radiator 43 is spaced apart from the air inlet 6, the<br><br>
cooling efficiency is not impaired.  Therefore, the cooling efficiency of the radiator 43 can be kept high while reducing the size of the front cover 4.<br>
Moreover, since the vertical length L1 of the air inlet 6 is set almost equal to the vertical length L2 of the radiator 43, it is possible to ensure a sufficient amount of air introduced and hence possible to enhance the cooling efficiency of the radiator 43.  Further, since the air discharge ports 8 are formed in the air discharge surface 62 orienting obliquely backward and sideways at both side portions of the leg shield 5 which corresponds to the rear cover, warm air after cooling the radiator 43 can be guided to the air discharge ports 8 in the air discharge surface 62 and can be smoothly discharged backward and outwardly sideways.  Thus, since the air is guided by utilizing the surface of the leg shield 5 as a design component without using any special air guide member as a separate member, the number of components used is not increased and it is possible to improve the appearance.  Besides, since the vertical length L3 of the air discharge ports 8 is set larger than the vertical length L1 of the air inlet 6, it is possible to improve the flowability of the air to be discharged and thereby<br><br>
further enhance the cooling efficiency.<br>
Further, since louvers 61 extending nearly horizontally are provided in the air inlet 6 so that their front end portions project forward from the front line (6a) of the front cover 4, the outside air introducing efficiency is improved. Moreover, since the radiator reservoir tank 45 of a relatively large capacity is disposed at a front lower position of the radiator 43 within the front cover 4 and the horn 36 of a relatively small size is disposed in a narrow space formed centrally above the radiator 43, both components can be accommodated in high space efficiency within the space 60 formed inside the front cover.  Thus, the dead space can be utilized effectively. Also in this point it is possible to reduce the size of the front cover 4.<br>
Moreover, since the headlight 11 of a relatively large size is provided in the front side of the handlebar cover 10 and the horn 46 of a relatively small size is disposed in a narrow space above the radiator 43 within the front cover 4, not only the radiator 43, cooling fan 44, radiator reservoir tank 45, and horn 46 can be accommodated in high space efficiency within the front<br><br>
cover 4, but also these components, including the headlight 11 can be disposed in the front portion of the vehicle body in high space efficiency.<br>
Further, since warm air to be discharged is conducted to the exterior by the air guide surface 73 provided on the bracket 70 which is for supporting the radiator 43, not only the air can be discharged<br>
efficiently even  without THE_provision of any special air<br><br>
guide member, but also it is possible to reduce the number of components used and simplify the structure. However, as shown in Fig. 13, if the air guide members 64 are provided inside the air discharge ports ,8, air candischarged more efficiently.<br><br>
