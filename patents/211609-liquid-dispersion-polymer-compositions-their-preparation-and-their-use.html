Liquid dispersion polymer compositions, their preparation and their use<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to liquid dispersion polymer compositions which comprise a dispersed polymer phase, a continuous carrier phase and a surfactant, their preparation and the use of these liquid dispersion polymer compositions to prepare microparticulate thickening systems which thicken aqueous or aqueous/organic compositions. More particularly it relates to liquid dispersion polymer compositions which comprise microparticles of a hydrophilic, water soluble or swellable polymer, preferably an acrylic-based polymer, which is dispersed in a silicone polymer fluid carrier phase and an oil-in-water surfactant, their preparation and the use of these liquid dispersion polymer compositions to prepare microparticulate thickening systems to thicken aqueous or aqueous/organic compositions, particularly for use in personal care and pharmaceutical formulations.<br>
Thickeners are used extensively in personal care formulations such as cosmetic and pharmaceutical formulations, to affect the aesthetics, product application and suspension and delivery of the active raw materials. Polymeric thickeners have been used for this purpose for many years. The types of polymeric thickeners that have been used range from natural gums such as guar, through modified natural materials such as hydroxyethyt cellulose, to synthetic thickeners such as the Carbomers   based on polyacrylic adds-<br>
The Salcare® range of liquid dispersion polymers, available through Ciba Specialty Chemicals, is a range of microparticulate acrylic-based polymeric thickeners in a hydrophobic carrier<br>
medium. Salcare® SC91 is an anionic thickening agent based on a sodium acrylate polymer and mineral g\\ carrier with PPG-1 trideceth-6 as the activator surfactant. Salcare® SC92 is a cationic copolymer thickener and conditioner comprising polyquaternium 32 and mineral oil. Salcare® SC95 and Salcare® SC96 are cationic homopolymer thickeners and conditioners. Salcare® SC95 comprises polyquaternium 37 in mineral oil with PPG-1 trideceth-6. Salcare® SC96 comprises polyquaternium 37 in propylene glycol dicaprylate dicaprate with PPG-1<br><br>
trideceth-6- Salcare"^ AST is an anionic thickening agent based on a sodium acrylate polymer in soya bean oil with PPG-1 trideceth-6.<br>
The tiny, spherical micropartides of the above hydrophilic acrylic polymers, whether anionic or cationic in charge, have a typical particle size in the range of 0.1 - 2 microns, with an average particle size in the range of 0.5 -1,0 microns. The polymer micropartides are preferably manufactured by methods in which water soluble vinyl addition monomers are polymerized utilizing a water-in-oil polymerization route.<br>
On stirring of any of the above liquid dispersion polymers into an aqueous system, the activator surfactant converts the hydrophobic carrier into an oil-in-water emulsion. By the term '^activator surfactant" is meant a surfactant which activates the conversion of the hydrophobic carrier into an oil-in-water emulsion. At the same time the hydrophilic polymer expands on exposure to water but does not dissolve, resulting in a smooth and rapid viscosity increase. Typically the polymer particles swell to give a microparticulate thickening system comprising polymer particles having a typical particle size in the range of 2.5 - 5 microns in diameter. Since the water molecules move into the small polymer particles by osmosis, the osmotic effect experienced by the polymer particle is a balance between water and any electrolyte present in the system. Hence high electrolyte levels reduce the swelling of the polymer particles.<br>
The microparticulate thickening systems have a pseudoplastic rheological profile which gives good stability and suspension characteristics at low shear rates (such as those experienced by the product on standing), and low apparent viscosity's at high shear rates, which corresponds to excellent rub-in characteristics.<br>
As previously mentioned, the continuous organic carrier phase for the above Salcare® liquid dispersion polymers is provided at least in part by a silicone polymer fluid.<br>

Other aspects of the present invention will become apparent from the following discussion and the examples. The exarhples merely illustrate certain aspects of the invention and are not intended to be limiting thereof.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
The hydrophilic, water swellable acrylic-based liquid dispersion polymer compositions employed in the present invention may be either anionic or cationic. Said polymers may be homopolymers or copolymers. They are formed from one or more monoethylenically unsaturated monomers that are either water soluble anionic or cationic monomers or from a predominantly anionic or cationic blend of monomers that may consist of anionic and cationic monomers or may consist of a mixture of anionic and/or cationic monomers and a minor amount of nonionic monomers.<br>
The polymers may conveniently be obtained in the form of microparticles having an average particle size in the range of 0.1 - 2 microns by reverse phase emulsion polymerization of suitable monomers in a hydrophobic liquid, i.e, a liquid which has sufficiently low miscibility with water that it can be used as the non-aqueous phase in a reverse phase polymerization. The liquid must have substantially no solvating effect for the polymer, or for the monomers from which it is formed, throughout the range of temperatures at which the polymer is likely to be synthesized (for instance from 15 to 100° C), since a solvating medium would be unsatisfactory for reverse<br><br>
phase emulsion polymerization. Likewise, the monomer or monomer blend must be water soluble to enable reverse phase polymerization to be carried out.<br>
Suitable anionic monomers include acrylic acid, methacrylic acid and their alkali metal and ammonium salts, 2-acrylamido-2-methyl-propanesulfonic acid and its salts, sodium styrene sulfonate and the like. Acrylic acid is the most prefemed anionic monomer. Preferably the carboxylic acid groups are at least 50%, advantageously 65-85% in the form of an alkali metal salt or ammonium salt, especially the sodium salt.<br>
Suitable cationic monomers include diallyl dialkyi monomers such as diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride, but preferably the cationic monomer is a dialkylaminoalkyi (meth)acrylate or -acrylamide. Although the polymer can be in free base form, especially when it is a cationic acrylamide or methacrylamide, it is preferably in the form of an acid addition or quaternary ammonium salt, such as (meth)acrylamido propyltrimethyl ammonium chloride.<br>
When the monomer is a cationic acrylamide or methacrylamide, the dialkylaminoalkyi group is generally a dialkylamino propyl or dialkylamino isopropyl group. When the monomer is a • cationic acrylate or methacrylate, the dialkylaminoalkyi group is generally a dialkylaminoethyl group.<br>
It is usually preferred for the cationic monomer to be a dialkylaminoalkyi (meth)acrylate acid salt or quaternary ammonium salt, most preferably dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate. Usually it is present as the methyl chloride quaternary ammonium salt.<br>
Suitable nonionic monomers include acrylamide, methacrylamide, N,-dialkylacrylamides. N,N,-dialkylacrylamides, N-vinyl pyrrolidone and water soluble hydroxy-substituted acrylic or methacrylic esters.<br>
If a cationic blend is used, the amount of cationic monomer is preferably more than 50% by weight of the blend, and usually it is at least 70% or at least 80% by weight of the blend. The preferred cationic polymers are formed wholly from cationic monomers.<br><br>
If an anionic blend is used, the amount of anionic monomer is preferably more than 60% by weight of the blend, and usually it is at least 80% by weight of the blend. The preferred anionic polymers are formed wholly from anionic monomers.<br>
The liquid dispersion polymer compositions are advantageously crosslinked by incorporating a small amount of a suitable crosslinking agent such as a pplyfunctional vinyl addition monomer into the polymerization mixture. Preferably a water soluble crosslinking agent is used.<br>
Any of the conventional ethylenically unsaturated cross linking agents or poly ethylenically unsaturated cross linking agents which are soluble in the monomer or monomer blend can be used, including materials which are di-, tri- or tetraethylenically unsaturated. Preferred are diethylenically unsaturated compounds such as methylene bis acrylamide, ethylene glycol di(meth) acrylate, di (meth)acrylamide, triallyl ammonium salts, vinyloxyethylacrylate or -methacrylate and the fike. Methylene bis acrylamide is the most preferred crosslinking agent.<br>
The amount of cross linking agent is generally in the range froni 100 to 10,000 parts by weight of cross linking agent per million parts (by dry weight) of monomer. Most preferably it is around 500 to 2000 ppm, especially 500 to 900 ppm for either cationic or anionic monomers. Optimum amounts can be determined by routine experimentation.<br>
Especially preferred polymers for use in the present invention are the anionic polymer dispersed in Saicare® SC91 and Salcare® AST, and the cationic polymers dispersed in Salcare® SC92, Salcare® SC95 and Salcare® SC96 liquid dispersion polymers.<br>
The hydrophiiic polymers are prepared by reverse phase emulsion polymerization of hydrophiiic monomers, preferably one or more acrylate and/or methacrylate monomers, in a hydrophobic liquid phase. Reverse phase emulsion polymerization is a well known technique which is described for example in U.S, Patent 4,628,078, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
The continuous phase for the preparation of the instant liquid dispersion polymer compositions is provided at least in part by a silicone polymer fluid. Since the liquid dispersion polymer<br><br>
compositions are primarily intended for cosmetic or pharmaceutical purposes, silicone polymer fluids which are cosmetically and/or pharmaceutically acceptable and which are sufficiently hydrophobic to be useful as the continuous phase in a reverse phase polymerization are preferably used as the continuous phase. Many such materials are known and are commercially available. Such silicone polymer fluids include cyclomethicones, dimethicones, phenyl dimethicones, phenyl trimethicones and the like, including mixtures thereof. Phenyl trimethicones are preferred.<br>
The amount of the hydrophobic liquid phase used in the polymerization is dictated primarily by the need to provide a satisfactory reverse phase emulsion medium. This would generally be at least about 0.5 parts by weight of the silicone polymer fluid per part by weight of the hydrophilic polymer (dry weight). In order to obtain liquid dispersion polymer compositions having higher amounts of the microparticles in the silicone polymer fluid, for example from 1.2 to about 1.7 parts by weight of the hydrophilic polymer (dry weight) in the silicone polymer fluid, as well as to facilitate processing, it is expedient to employ a volatile inert hydrophobic solvent Suitable inert hydrophobic solvents include hydrocarbons and halogenated hydrocarbons. One particularly preferred hydrocarbon mixture is Isopar G "RTM" from Exxon. Conveniently 1 to 2 parts, ■ preferably 1.3 to 1.9 parts of the volatile inert hydrophobic solvent per part of the hydrophilic polymer on a dry weight basis is employed.<br>
The polymer is prepared by conventional reverse phase emulsion procedures, namely by adding 1 part by weight (dry weight) of at least one aqueous ethylenically unsaturated monomer, optionally including a sequesterant and a crosslinking ethylenically unsaturated monomer, into about 1 to 3 parts by weight of a hydrophobic liquid comprising at least in part a liquid hydrophobic silicone polymer fluid and containing about 0.1 to 0.2 parts of at least one conventional water-in-oil emulsifier having a HLB value below 9,0 and optionally 0.5 to 10.0 parts of a polymeric stabilizer surfactant, with intensive agitation so as to form a substantially stable emulsion of the required fine particle size. Suitable water-in-oij emulsifiers are well known to those skilled in the art. Sorbitan esters are preferred. Diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid, sodium salt is a suitable sequesterant. The ethylenically unsaturated monomer may be diethyienically or polyethylenically unsaturated.<br><br>
The reaction mixture is purged with nitrogen and polymerization is initiated by addition of a conventional source of free radicals. Suitable polymerization initiators are well known to those skilled in the art. Typical free radical-forming catalysts include peroxygen compounds such as sodium, potassium and ammonium persulfates, caprylyl peroxide, benzoyl peroxide, hydrogen peroxide, pelargonyl peroxide, cumene hydroperoxide, tertiary butyl diperphthalate, tertiary butyl perbenzoate, sodium peracetate, di(2-ethylhexyl)peroxydicarbonate, and the like, as well as azo catalysts such as azodiisobutyronitrile. Other useful catalysts are the heavy metal-activated catalyst systems. A preferred type of polymerization initiator is a redox initiation pair, After initiation appropriate temperature and agitation conditions are maintained until the conversion of the monomer to polymer is substantially complete. Appropriate conditions are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
The water and any volatile solvent are then removed from the reverse phase emulsion, for example by distillation under reduced pressure, so as to produce a substantially anhydrous stable dispersion of polymer particles less than 2 microns in size dispersed in the silicone polymer fluid.<br>
About 1.0% to 10.0% by weight, based on the weight of the composition, preferably from 2% to 8% by weight of a nonionic oil-in-water emulsifier having a HLB generally above 7 is added after distillation is complete. Suitable emulsifiers of this type are well known to those skilled in the art. Ethoxylated alcohols are preferred.<br>
It is a further feature of the invention that a suitable polymeric stabiliser surfactant is employed as a processing aid to maintain emulsion integrity through the distillation process and to provide for the final liquid polymer dispersion to be a free flowing liquid, even when it contains high levels of microparticles of the water soluble or swellable dispersed polymer.<br>
Advantageously 0.5 to 10.0 parts, preferably 1.0 to 6.0 parts, of this surfactant is employed per part by weight (dry weight) of the ethylenically unsaturated monomer.<br>
A preferred polymeric surfactant is a copolymer of an alkyl (meth)acrylate and an amino functional monomer, which may be prepared as follows:<br><br>
Alkyl (meth)acrylate, amino functional monomer and a suitable oil soluble thermal initiator, for example 2,2'-Azobts(2-methylbutyronitrile), are dissolved in an inert solvent, for example an aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon solvent such as Isopar G "RTM", This mixture is fed into a vessel containing further solvent and thermal initiator over a period of 2 to 6 hours at reaction temperatures of 80 to 90°C. The reaction is maintained at this temperature for a further two hours before being cooled and run off.<br>
The alkyl group of the Alkyi (meth)acrylate-may be any suitable alkyl group, however Cg to C22 groups are preferred.<br>
The amino functional monomer is of the general formula (1):<br><br>
The alkyl (meth)acrylate ; amino functional monomer ratio may be between 0.5 to 8.0 :1 on a molar basis. Preferably between 0.75 to 6,0 :1, and most preferably between 1.0 to 4,0 ; 1 on a molar basis.<br>
The molecular weight may be determined by conventional chromatography techniques well known to those skilled in the art. Typical molecular weights may be in the range of 10,000 to 60,000, most typically in the range of 15,000 to 40,000.<br>
Upon stirring the liquid dispersion into an aqueous system, the non-ionic surfactant converts the hydrophobic carrier into an oil-in-water emulsion. At the same time the hydrophilic polymer expands on exposure to water resulting in a smooth and rapid viscosity increase, Typically the<br><br>
polymer particles swell to give a microparticulate thickening system comprising polymer particles having a typical particle size in the range of 2.5 to 5.0 microns.<br>
The inventive liquid dispersion compositions provide microparticulate thickening systems which give effective thickening to aqueous or aqueous/organic formulations at concentrations of 0.1 to 8.0 %. Preferably 1 % to 6% by weight. In addition however they combine the thickening effect of the liquid dispersion polymer with the advantages of the silicone polymer fluid.<br>
The liquid dispersion polymer compositions are compatible with a wide variety of personal care active ingredients and auxiliaries. Typical formulation examples where the polymers may be used include:<br>
Skin Care formulations including all kind of face and body emulsions like creams, lotions, milks and sprays for caring, cleansing, deodorisation and depiliation, colour cosmetics such as; liquid foundations, liquid eyeshadows, liquid blushers, lipsticks and aqueous mascara's; facial masks, lip balms, skin care formulations like body washes, all kind of shaving products; hand soaps, soap bars and soap liquids.<br>
Hair Care formulations which include; hair conditioners, hair colourations (permanent, semipermanent and temporary), styling gels, lotions and creams, shampoos, hair relaxers, hair perms and hair masks.<br>
Sun Tan formulations such as: sun tan creams, lotions and sprays, sun blocks, tan accelerators, after sun creams, lotions and sprays and sunless tanning lotions or creams.<br>
The formulation examples below merely illustrate a few representative aspects of the formulating possibilities and are not intended to be limiting in any way. The most particularly preferred composition is where the polymer in the liquid dispersion polymer comprises microparticles of a water swellable cationic polymer, and wherein the silicone polymer fluid is a phenyl trimethicone.<br><br>
