				<td>OPIOID DOSAGE FORMS HAVING DOSE PROPORTIONAL STEADY<br>
STATE CAVE AND AUC AND LESS THAN DOSE PROPORTIONAL SINGLE<br>
DOSE CMAX<br>
1. FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001 ] The present invention relates to a plurality of dosage forms comprising a first<br>
dosage form and a second dosage form comprising an opioid; wherein the second dosage<br>
form has a dosage strength or amount which is greater than that of the first dosage form;<br>
and wherein the steady state Cave and the steady state AUC of the first dosage form and the<br>
second dosage form are dose proportional; and the single dose Cmax of the second dosage<br>
form is less than the minimum level for dose proportionality with respect to the first dosage<br>
form. In one embodiment, the single dose of AUC the first dosage form and the second<br>
dosage form are also dose proportional. The present invention also relates to methods of<br>
administering such dosage forms to a patient, as well as to kits comprising such dosage<br>
forms and instructions for administration of the dosage forms to a patient.<br>
2. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Opioids provide patients with meaningful beneficial effects, however, often<br>
patients also experience adverse effects from those same opioids. For example, opioids are<br>
useful as moderate to strong analgesic agents, but often cause other pharmacological side<br>
effects as well, such as drowsiness, respiratory depression, euphoria, nausea, dizziness,<br>
vomiting, pruritis and changes in mood. Such adverse effects can result in a patient's<br>
noncompliance, including discontinuation of therapy or missed doses.<br>
[0003] There have been previous attempts in the art to increase the tamper<br>
resistance and patient acceptance of opioids. For example, controlled release dosage forms<br>
have been developed that release an active ingredient over many hours.<br>
[0004] There remains a need in the art for improved dosage forms for administering<br>
opioids that can reduce adverse effects, and thus can potentially increase patient acceptance<br>
and abuse resistance.<br>
[0005] All documents cited herein are incorporated by reference in their entireties<br>
for all purposes.<br>
3. DEFINITIONS<br>

containing an opioid and one or more excipients, preferably including a hydrophobic<br>
controlled release material as described herein. Preferably, the matrix multiparticulates<br>
have a size in the range of from about 0.1 to about 12 mm in any dimension, more<br>
preferably from about 0.1 to about 5 mm. The matrix multiparticulates can be any<br>
geometrical shape. In certain embodiments, the matrix multiparticulates are made by a<br>
process comprising extrusion, and in one embodiment, the matrix multiparticulates are<br>
made by a process comprising melt extrusion.<br>

of the opioid reaching the system is approximately the same as the amount of the drug<br>
leaving the system. Thus, at steady state, the patient's body eliminates the opioid at<br>
approximately the same rate that the drug becomes available to the patient's system through<br>
absorption into the bloodstream. Generally, steady state is not achieved until after several<br>
sequential administrations of a dosage of an opioid at specified time intervals.<br>
[0015] As used herein, the phrase "therapeutic agent" or "pharmaceutical agent"<br>

4. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0018] The present invention relates to a plurality of dosage forms comprising a first<br>
dosage form having a first dosage strength or amount of an opioid, and a second dosage<br>
form having a second dosage strength of the opioid which is greater than the first dosage<br>
strength; wherein the first dosage form and the second dosage form each have a steady state<br>
Cave, a steady state AUC and a single dose C ; and wherein the steady state Cave and the<br>
steady state AUC of the first dosage form and the second dosage form are dose proportional<br>
and the single dose Cmax of the second dosage form is less than the minimum level for dose<br>
proportionality with respect to the first dosage form. In certain embodiments, the single<br>
dose Cmax of the second dosage form is 75% or less of the Cmax of the first dosage form<br>
times the dosage strength ratio of the second dosage form to the first dosage form. The<br>
invention also relates to a method of administering such dosage forms comprising<br>
administering the first dosage form and, thereafter, administering the second dosage form.<br>
[0019] In one embodiment, the first dosage form and the second dosage form each<br>
have a single dose AUC and the single dose AUC of the first dosage form and the second<br>
dosage form are also dose proportional. In one embodiment, the dosage forms are each<br>
controlled release dosage forms. In certain embodiments, the opioid is hydrocodone.<br>
[0020] The present invention also relates to a plurality of dosage forms comprising a<br>
first dosage form comprising a first dosage strength of an opioid; a second dosage form<br>
comprising a second dosage strength of the opioid; and a third dosage form comprising a<br>
third dosage strength of the opioid; wherein the third dosage strength is greater than the<br>
second dosage strength and the second dosage strength is greater than the first dosage<br>
strength; and wherein the first dosage form, the second dosage form and the third dosage<br>
form each have a steady state Cave, a steady state AUC and a single dose Cmax; and the<br>
steady state Cave and the steady state AUC of the first dosage form, the second dosage form<br>
and the third dosage form are each dose proportional with respect to each other; the single<br>
dose Cmax of the second dosage form is less than the minimum level for dose proportionality<br>
with respect to the first dosage form; and the single dose Cmax of the third dosage form is<br>
less than the minimum level for dose proportionality with respect to the second dosage<br>
form. In certain embodiments, the single dose Cmax of the second dosage form is 75% or<br>
less of the single dose Cmax of the first dosage form times the dosage strength ratio of the<br>
second dosage form to the first dosage form; and the single dose Cmax of the third dosage<br>
form is 75% or less of the single dose Cmax of the second dosage form times the dosage<br>
strength ratio of the third dosage form to the second dosage form. The invention also<br>
relates to a method of administering such dosage forms comprising administering the first<br>
dosage form, thereafter administering the second dosage form, and thereafter, administering<br>
the third dosage form.<br>
[0021] In one embodiment, the first dosage form, the second dosage form and the<br>

each dose proportional. In certain embodiments, the opioid is hydrocodone.<br>
The present invention also relates to a kit for treating a patient comprising a plurality<br>
of dosage forms according to the invention, and a set of printed instructions directing the<br>
administration of the first dosage form to the patient, and thereafter, the administration of<br>
the second dosage form to the patient, and if present, thereafter, the administration of the<br>
third dosage form to the patient.<br>
[0022] The present invention can be understood more fully by reference to the<br>
following figures, detailed description and examples, which are intended to exemplify nonlimiting<br>
embodiments of the invention.<br>
5. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0023] Figure 1 shows opioid plasma concentration-time profiles for a single dose<br>
of the 30 mg hydrocodone dosage form of Formulation A of Example 1 and for a single<br>
dose of the hydrocodone dosage form of Formulation B of Example 1, dose adjusted to <br>
mg, respectively.<br>
[0024] Figure 2 shows opioid plasma concentration-time profiles for multiple doses<br>
of the dosage forms of Figure 1, based on super positioning.<br>
6. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0025] It is the belief of the inventors that delivery release characteristics (rate,<br>
extent, profile) can influence a patient's acceptance of medications and the tamper<br>
resistance of medications. For example, certain medications having a faster drug delivery<br>
rate (as seen with certain immediate release medications) are reported to have lower patient<br>
acceptance and increased adverse effects. The inventors believe that immediate release<br>
dosage forms of certain therapeutic agents can also present decreased abuse resistance and<br>
greater reinforcing properties compared to medications that have a slower drug delivery<br>
rate. Additionally, the inventors believe that drug abusers often tend to prefer higher<br>
dosage strength dosage forms in order to experience the euphoric effects of the drug.<br>
[0026] The present invention provides a plurality of dosage forms comprising a first<br>
dosage form having a first dosage strength of an opioid, such as hydrocodone; and a second<br>
dosage form having a second dosage strength of the opioid; wherein the second dosage<br>
strength is greater than the first dosage strength; and wherein the first dosage form and the<br>
second dosage form each have a steady state Cave, a steady state AUC and a single dose<br>
Cmax, and the steady state Cave and the steady state AUC of the first dosage form and the<br>
second dosage form are dose proportional, and the single dose Cmax of the second dosage<br>
form is less than the minimum level for dose proportionality with respect to the first dosage<br>
form.<br>
[0027] In certain embodiments, the single dose C^ of the second dosage form is<br>
75% or less, e.g., 70% or less, 65% or less or 60% or less, of the CmaX of the first dosage<br>
form times the dosage strength ratio of the second dosage form to the first dosage form.<br>
[0028] In one embodiment, the first dosage form and the second dosage form each<br>
have a single dose AUC, and the single dose AUC of the second dosage form and the first<br>
dosage form are also dose proportional.<br>
[0029] In certain embodiments, the present invention provides a plurality of dosage<br>
forms comprising three dosage forms, a first dosage form, a second dosage form, and a third<br>
dosage form, each comprising of an opioid, such as hydrocodone. In these embodiments,<br>
the dosage strength of the third dosage form is greater than the dosage strength of the<br>
second dosage form, and the dosage strength of the second dosage form is greater than that<br>
of the first dosage form. The steady state Cave and the steady state AUC of the first, second<br>
and third dosage forms are dose proportional; the single dose Cmax of the second dosage<br>
form is less than the minimum level for dose proportionality with respect to the first dosage<br>
form, and the single dose Cmax of the third dosage form is less than the minimum level for<br>
dose proportionality with respect to the second dosage form. In certain embodiments, the<br>
single dose Cmax of the third dosage form is 75% or less, e.g., 70% or less, 65% or less or<br>
60% or less, of the Cmax of the first dosage form times the dosage strength ratio of the<br>
second dosage form to the first dosage form. Similarly, in certain embodiments, the Cmax of<br>
the third dosage form is 75% or less, e.g., 70% or less, 65% or less or 60% or less, of the<br>
Cmax of the second dosage form times the dosage strength ratio of the third dosage form to<br>
the second dosage form.<br>
[0030] In one embodiment, the single dose AUC of the first, second and third<br>
dosage forms, respectively, are also dose proportional.<br>
[0031 ] It is anticipated that drug abusers will find the higher dosage strength dosage<br>
forai(s) made in accordance with the invention to be less desirable to abuse due to the<br>
above-described levels of Cmax which are less than dose proportional to the lower dosage<br>
strength dosage form(s). Additionally, it is anticipated that patients who have a need to<br>
increase the dosage strength of medication will experience less adverse effects, and thus<br>
find the higher dosage strength dosage form(s) of the present invention to be more<br>
acceptable and tolerable.<br>
[0032] In addition to comprising the opioid having the characteristics described in<br>
the claims, the dosage forms of the present invention can contain additional compounds,<br>
including but not limited to, one or more additional therapeutic agents and/or opioid<br>
antagonists and/or aversive agents.<br>
[0033] Examples of such therapeutic agents include, but are not limited to,<br>

propranolol, clonidine), antihypertensives (e.g., clonidine, methyldopa), bronchodilators<br>
(e.g., albuterol), steroids (e.g., hydrocortisone, triamcinolone, prednisone), antibiotics (e.g.,<br>
tetracycline), antihemorrhoidals, hypnotics, psychotropics; antidiarrheals, mucolytics,<br>
sedatives, decongestants, laxatives, vitamins, stimulants (including appetite suppressants<br>
such as phenylpropanolamine), as well as salts, hydrates, solvates and other<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable forms of the same.<br>
[0034] Examples of opioid antagonists include but are not limited to, naloxone,<br>
naltrexone, nalmefene, nalbuphine, nalorphine, cyclazacine, cyclazocine, levallorphan,<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, and mixtures of any two or more of the<br>
foregoing. Examples of aversive agents include, but are not limited to a bittering agent, an<br>
irritant and a gelling agent. Additional examples and details of aversive agents are set forth<br>
in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003/0124185 Al to Oshlack et al., which is<br>
expressly incorporated herein in its entirety for all purposes. The dosage form can be<br>
formulated in such a manner that the opioid antagonist and/or the aversive agent are only<br>
released upon tampering with the dosage form.<br>
[0035] The dosage forms used in the methods of the present invention can be<br>
prepared in accordance with any technology known in the art, including but not limited to<br>
that exemplified below.<br>

capsules (hard and soft gelatin) and pills are also described in Remington's Pharmaceutical<br>
Sciences, 18th ed. Arthur Osol, 1553-93 (1990), which is incorporated herein in its entirety<br>
for all purposes. In one embodiment, a suitable amount of multiparticulates are compressed<br>
into an oral tablet using conventional tableting equipment and standard techniques. In yet<br>
another embodiment, the extrudate can be shaped into tablets as described in U.S. Patent<br>
No. 4,957,681 to Klimesch et al., which is incorporated herein in its entirety for all<br>
purposes.<br>
[0043] In certain embodiments, the opioid can be dispersed in a controlled release<br>
matrix. Any controlled release matrix can be used in the oral dosage form of the invention.<br>
Controlled release matrices for dosage forms are well known in the art (See, e.g.,<br>
Remingtons Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th ed. Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA, 1990, p.<br>
1684-1685), which is incorporated herein in its entirety for all purposes. Additional<br>
examples of useful controlled release matrices are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,958,459;<br>
5,965,161; 5,968,551; 6,294,195 and 6,335,033, each to Oshlack et al. and 6,143,328 to<br>
Heafield et al., each of which is incorporated herein in its entirety for all purposes.<br>
[0044] The controlled release matrix can comprise a fusible hydrophobic material,<br>
optionally combined with a hydrophilic material. The hydrophobic fusible material can be,<br>
for example, a hydrophobic polymer or a natural or synthetic wax or oil, such as<br>
hydrogenated vegetable oil or hydrogenated castor oil, preferably having a melting point of<br>
from about 35 to 100°C, more preferably from about 45 to 90°C. The hydrophilic material<br>
can be a hydrophilic polymer; a water soluble fusible material, such as polyethylene glycol;<br>
or a water soluble particulate material, such as dicalcium phosphate or lactose. However,<br>
any pharmaceutically acceptable hydrophobic or hydrophilic material capable of imparting<br>
controlled release of the opioid can be used in accordance with the present invention.<br>
10<br>
[0045] The therapeutic agent dispersed in a controlled release matrix can be<br>
prepared by formulating the therapeutic agent with a non-fusible material, component other<br>
than the fusible component. Suitable non-fusible materials for inclusion in a controlled<br>
release matrix include, but are not limited to:<br>
[0046] (a) hydrophilic or hydrophobic polymers, such as gums, cellulose ethers,<br>
protein-derived materials, nylon, acrylic resins, polylactic acid, polyvinylchloride, starches,<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidones, and cellulose acetate phthalate. For example, cellulose ethers,<br>
preferably substituted cellulose ethers such as alkylcelluloses (e.g., ethylcellulose), Cl - C6<br>
hydroxyalkylcelluloses (e.g., hydroxypropylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose and<br>
hydroxyethyl cellulose), carboxyalkylcelluloses and acrylic resins (e.g., acrylic acid<br>
polymers and copolymers; and methacrylates such as methacrylic acid polymers and<br>
copolymers) are useful. The controlled release matrix can conveniently contain between<br>
1% and 80% (by weight) of the hydrophobic and/or hydrophilic polymer.<br>
[0047] (b) digestible, long chain (C8 - C50, preferably C8 - C40) substituted or<br>
unsubstituted hydrocarbons, such as hydrogenated vegetable oils; fatty alcohols, such as<br>
lauryl, myristyl, stearyl, cetyl or, preferably cetostearyl alcohol; fatty acids, including fatty<br>
acid glycerides (mono-, di- and tri-glycerides), hydrogenated fats, glyceryl esters of fatty<br>
acids, for example, glyceryl monostearate; vegetable oils; mineral oils; normal waxes;<br>
stearic acid and natural and synthetic waxes, such as beeswax, glycowax, castor wax, and<br>
carnauba wax, and other wax-like substances; and hydrophobic and hydrophilic materials<br>
having hydrocarbon backbones. Hydrocarbons having a melting point of between about<br>
25°C and 90°C are useful. For example, fatty (aliphatic) alcohols are useful in certain<br>
embodiments. The controlled release matrix can contain up to 80% (by weight) of at least<br>
one digestible, long chain hydrocarbon.<br>
[0048] (c) Polyalkylene glycols. The controlled release matrix can contain up to<br>
60% (by weight) of at least one polyalkylene glycol.<br>
[0049] A suitable controlled release matrix, for use in the oral dosage form of the<br>
invention can comprise one or more cellulose ethers or acrylic resins, one or more C12 -<br>
C36, e.g., C12 - C22, aliphatic alcohols, and/or one or more hydrogenated vegetable oils.<br>
One particular suitable matrix comprises one or more alkylcelluloses, one or more C12 -<br>
C22 aliphatic alcohols and one or more polyalkylene glycols. For example, the matrix can<br>
contain between about 0.5% and 60%, e.g., between 1% and 50% (by weight) of the<br>
cellulose ether.<br>
[0050] The acrylic resin can be a methacrylate such as methacrylic acid copolymer<br>
USNF Type A (EUDRAGIT L), Type B (EUDRAGIT S), Type C (EUDRAGIT L 100-55),<br>
EUDRAGIT NE 30 D, EUDRAGIT E, EUDRAGIT RL, or EUDRAGIT RS (commercially<br>
available from Rohm Pharma GmbH, Weiterstat, Germany). For example, the matrix can<br>
contain between about 0.5% and 60% by weight, e.g., between 1% and 50% by weight, of<br>
the acrylic resin.<br>
[0051] In certain embodiments, the dosage form comprises a controlled release<br>
matrix comprising the opioid and at least one water soluble hydroxyalkyl cellulose, at least<br>
one C12-C36, preferably C14-C22, aliphatic alcohol, and, optionally, at least one<br>
polyalkylene glycol. The hydroxyalkyl cellulose can be a hydroxy (Cl to C6) alkyl<br>
cellulose, such as hydroxypropylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, and most<br>
preferably, hydroxyethyl cellulose. The amount of the at least one hydroxyalkyl cellulose<br>
in the present dosage form can be determined by, inter alia, the precise rate of release of the<br>
opioid required. The aliphatic alcohol can be, for example, lauryl alcohol, myristyl alcohol,<br>
stearyl alcohol, cetyl alcohol or cetostearyl alcohol and mixtures of any two or more of the<br>
foregoing. The amount of the aliphatic alcohol to be included in the present dosage form<br>
can be determined, as above, by, inter alia, the precise rate of release of the opioid required.<br>
It can also depend on whether at least one polyalkylene glycol is present in, or absent from,<br>
the dosage form.<br>
[0052] In one embodiment, in the absence of polyalkylene glycol, the matrix can<br>
contain between about 1% and 50%, .e.g., between about 2% and 36% by weight of the<br>
aliphatic alcohol. In another embodiment, polyalkylene glycol is present in the oral dosage<br>
form, and the combined weight of the aliphatic alcohol and the polyalkylene glycol can<br>
constitute between about 2% and 40%, e.g., between abovit 2 and 36% by weight of the total<br>
dosage form.<br>
[0053] In certain embodiments, the polyalkylene glycol can be, for example,<br>
polypropylene glycol or, preferably, polyethylene glycol. For example, the number average<br>
molecular weight of the at least one polyalkylene glycol can be between 200 and 15,000,<br>
e.g., between 400 and 12,000 or between 1,500 and 12,000.<br>
 [0054] In certain embodiments, the controlled release of the opioid can be affected<br>
by various inducers, for example pH, temperature, enzymes, water, or other physiological<br>
conditions or compounds.<br>
[0055] The controlled release matrix containing the opioid can readily be prepared,<br>
for example, by dispersing the opioid in the components of the matrix using conventional<br>
pharmaceutical techniques including, but not limited to, melt-granulation, wet granulation,<br>
dry blending, dry granulation, co-precipitation, extrusion and melt extrusion.<br>
[0056] Incorporation of the opioid in the matrix can be effected, for example, by the<br>
following steps:<br>
[0057] (a) directly metering into an extruder a hydrophobic sustained release<br>
material, the opioid, and an optional binder material;<br>
[0058] (b) heating the homogeneous mixture; extruding the homogeneous mixture<br>
to thereby form strands; cooling the strands containing the homogeneous mixture (if<br>
necessary);<br>
[0059] (c) cutting the strands into matrix multiparticulates having a size ranging<br>
from about 0.1 mm to about 5 mm in any dimension; and<br>
[0060] (d) dividing the particles into unit doses. In this aspect of the invention, a<br>
relatively continuous manufacturing procedure is realized.<br>
[0061] Typical melt-extrusion production systems suitable for use in accordance<br>
with the present invention include a suitable extruder drive motor having a variable speed<br>
and constant torque control, start-stop controls, and ammeter. In addition, the production<br>
system typically includes a temperature control console that includes temperature sensors,<br>
cooling means and temperature indicators throughout the length of the extruder. Further,<br>
the production system typically includes an extruder, such as a twin-screw extruder, which<br>
comprises two counter-rotating intermeshing screws enclosed within a cylinder or barrel<br>
having an aperture or die at the exit thereof. The feed materials enter through a feed<br>
hopper; are moved through the barrel by the screws; and are forced through the die into<br>
strands, which are thereafter conveyed, such as by a continuous movable belt, to allow for<br>
cooling and being directed to a pelletizer or other suitable device to render the extruded<br>
strands into the matrix multiparticulate system. For example, the pelletizer can comprise<br>
rollers, a fixed knife, a rotating cutter and the like. Suitable instruments and systems are<br>
available from distributors such as C.W. Brabender Instruments, Inc. of South Hackensack,<br>
New Jersey. Other suitable apparatus will be apparent to those of ordinary skill ir. the art.<br>
For example, the dosage forms can be prepared using a Werner-Pfleiderer twin screw<br>
extruder.<br>
[0062] The diameter of the extruder aperture or exit port can be adjusted to vary the<br>
thickness of the extended strands. Furthermore, the exit port of the extruder need not be<br>
round; it can be, e.g., oblong, rectangular, etc. The exiting strands can be reduced to<br>
particles using, e.g., a hot wire cutter, guillotine, etc.<br>
[0063] A matrix multiparticulate system can be, for example, in the form of<br>
granules, spheroids or pellets, depending upon the extruder exit port. In one embodiment,<br>
dosage forms are prepared that include an effective amount of matrix multiparticulates<br>
within a capsule. For example, a plurality of the matrix multiparticulates can be placed in a<br>
gelatin capsule in an amount sufficient to provide an effective controlled release dose when<br>
ingested and contacted by gastrointestinal fluid.<br>
[0064] The dosage forms of the present invention can comprise combinations of<br>
matrix multiparticulates containing opioid and having differing formulations and/or<br>
characteristics. Furthermore, the controlled release dosage forms can also include a portion<br>
of the total amount of opioid in immediate release form to provide a prompt therapeutic<br>
effect. The immediate release opioid can be incorporated, e.g., as separate multiparticulates<br>
within a gelatin capsule, or can be coated on the surface of, e.g., matrix multiparticulates.<br>
[0065] Additional examples of methods of making controlled release dosage forms<br>
that can be used in accordance with the present invention include those described in U.S.<br>
Patent Nos. 5,266,331; 5,324,351; 5,356,467; 5,472,712; 5,500,227; 5,508,042; 5,549,912;<br>
5,656,295; and 6,024,982, each to Oshlack et al., and 5,958,459 to Chasin et al., the<br>
contents of which are each expressly incorporated herein for all purposes.<br>
[0066] In certain embodiments, the dosage forms or the uncoated or coated<br>
sustained release spheroids, granules, or matrix multiparticulates containing the opioid can<br>
be cured until an endpoint is reached at which the sustained release spheroids, granules, or<br>
matrix multiparticulates provide a stable dissolution. The curing endpoint can be<br>
determined by comparing the dissolution profile (curve) of the dosage form immediately<br>
after curing to the dissolution profile (curve) of the dosage form after exposure to<br>
accelerated storage conditions of, e.g., at least one month at a temperature of 40 degrees C<br>
and a relative humidity of 75%. Cured formulations are described in detail in U.S. Patent<br>
Nos. 5,273,760; 5,286,493; 5,580,578; 5,639,476 and 5,681,585, each to Oshlack et al., the<br>
disclosures of which are each incorporated herein in their entirety for all purposes.<br>
[0067] In addition to the above ingredients, the dosage forms can also contain<br>
suitable quantities of other materials, e.g., plasticizers, diluents, lubricants, binders,<br>
granulating aids, colorants, flavorants and glidants that are conventional in the<br>
pharmaceutical art. In certain embodiments, these additional materials can be present in<br>
amounts up to about 50% by weight of the formulation, if desired. The quantities of these<br>
additional materials sufficient to provide the desired effect to the desired formulation can be<br>
determined by one of ordinary skill. For example, the addition of a small amount of talc to<br>
the sustained release coating reduces the tendency of the aqueous dispersion to stick during<br>
processing, and acts as a polishing agent. Specific examples of pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
carriers and excipients that can be used to formulate oral dosage forms are described in. the<br>
Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients, American Pharmaceutical Association (1986).<br>
[0068] The following examples illustrate various aspects of the present invention.<br>
They are not to be construed to limit the claims in any manner whatsoever. Rather,<br>
pluralities of dosage forms which have characteristics which are either more similar to one<br>
another or less similar to one another may also fall within the scope of the present<br>
invention.<br>
9. EXAMPLE<br>
9.1 EXAMPLE 1; Hvdrocodone Bitartrate<br>
[0069] A study was conducted which served to compare two oral controlled release<br>
opioid formulations having different release characteristics. In that study, healthy male<br>
volunteers were randomized into a single-dose, 4-way crossover pharmacokinetic study<br>
with hydrocodone bitartrate controlled release oral tablets. The initial objective of the study<br>
was to assess the pharmakokinetic ("PK") profiles and then in vitro/ in vivo correlation<br>
("IV/IVC") for 30 mg dosage strength controlled release hydrocodone formulations having<br>
differing dissolution profiles. The hydrocodone bitartrate controlled release ("HYCR") oral<br>
dosage forms included the following: 1) Formulation A, a 30 mg tablet having a first in<br>
vitro dissolution profile; and 2) Formulation B, a 30 mg tablet having an in vitro dissolution<br>
profile which was slower than that of Formulation A for the time period from 1 to i2 hours.<br>
(Table Removed)  Used for processing and remains in product as residual moisture only.<br>
[0071 ] To prepare tablets having these hydrocodone bitartrate formulations, the<br>
specified amount of hydrocodone bitartrate was measured out into 15mg or 30mg dosages,<br>
depending upon the formulation. The selected dosage amount of hydrocodone was then<br>
sprayed with a eudragit/triacetin dispersion. Dried lactose and povidone were then sprayed<br>
on the composition using a fluid bed granulator. After spraying, the granulation was<br>
discharged and passed through a mill. Melted stearyl alcohol was then added to the<br>
granulation using a mixer, and the granulation was allowed to cool. The cooled granulation<br>
was passed through a mill. Talc and magnesium stearate were added in a mixer in order to<br>
lubricate the granulation. The granulation was then compressed into tablets using a tablet<br>
press. After forming the tablet, an aqueous film coat was applied to the tablets.<br>
Dissolution Method:<br>
The in vitro dissolution for the two formulations was obtained using U.S.P. Apparatus II<br>
(Paddle Method) with 700 ml of simulated gastric fluid for the first 55 minutes at 100 rpm<br>
and 37°C followed by 900 ml of simulated intestinal fluid for the remainder of testing. The<br>
results were measured by high performance liquid chromatography. The results are set<br>
The adverse effects of hydrocodone bitrate were studied on 32 healthy, young adult male<br>
volunteers in a single dose, 4-way, randomized, crossover study. Thirty subjects completed<br>
the study, and two subjects were discontinued due to protocol violations. Each patient was<br>
administered either one 30 mg dosage form of Formulation A or one 30 mg dosage form of<br>
Formulation B or one 30 mg dosage form or 30 mg of one of two other controlled release<br>
hydrocodone formulations which had dissolution profiles slower than Formulation A and<br>
faster than Formulation B over a 12 hour period. The subjects were screened for a period<br>
up to 14 days. The study was a single dose, 4-way, randomized crossover study. All<br>
treatments were administered under fasted conditions having dose periods separated by a 7-<br>
day washout. The subjects were screened for entry into the study and randomly assigned to<br>
a treatment sequence for crossover dosing.<br>
[0072] Table 2 below presents common adverse events (irrespective of relationship<br>
to study drug), i.e., those with an incidence of &gt;5%, for any treatment by COSTART<br>
(Coding System for Thesaurus of Adverse Reaction Terms) term.<br>
A lower incidence of adverse events was reported with Formulation B (n=4) than with<br>
Formulation A (n=8). The common (incidence (Table Removed) 5%) adverse events (vomiting, dizziness,<br>
nausea, pruritus, and somnolence) are among those expected from hydrocodone treatment.<br>
Significantly, the number of adverse events, including those considered to be related to<br>
treatment, the number of subjects reporting adverse events, and the number of moderate<br>
adverse events (none was rated severe) were all lower with Formulation B than with<br>
Formulation A. These results indicate that the different release characteristics of<br>
Formulation B compared to Formulation A resulted in a decrease in adverse effects which<br>
was greater than expected.<br>
[0074] Based in part on the foregoing study results, the inventors believe that<br>
beneficial results would be obtained by formulating a plurality of dosage forms wherein the<br>
second dosage form has a dosage strength greater than the first dosage form, and wherein<br>
the steady state Cave and the steady state AUC of the first and second dosage forms are<br>
dose proportional and the single dose Cmax of the second dosage form is less than the<br>
minimum level for does proportionality with respect to the first dosage form. The inventors<br>
also believe that it would further be beneficial for this first and second dosage forms to have<br>
dose proportional single dose AUC values.<br>
[0075] The inventors dose adjusted the Formulation A dosage form from 30mg to<br>
15mg. The pharmacokinetic data for Formulation A dose adjusted to 15 mg and<br>
Formulation B (30 mg) are set forth in Tables 3 and 4 below: (Table Removed)<br><br><br><br><br><br>
