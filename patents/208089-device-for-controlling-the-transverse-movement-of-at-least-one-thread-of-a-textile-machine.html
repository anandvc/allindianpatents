The innovation Relates tg a device for controlling at leapt one thread of a textile machine, in particular a Warp thread of a weaving machine, in accordance with the preamble of Claim 1.    <br><br><br><br><br><br>
case, pressure fluid fed in accordance with Claim 9 can serve as the meanp  for feeding energy. A particularly simple solution is circumscribed, contrast, by Claim 10. In this case, the supply of energy can be configured to go beyond what is required to maintain the vibrating movement of the vibrating system, with the result that additional control effects can be achieved.<br><br>
There are various possibilities for connecting a thread to the driver part. In the simplest case, the device is constructed according to Claim 13, the thread driver being arranged between the strings and being constructed as an eyelet according to Claim 15. In accordance with Claim 14, however, the connection of the thread from the vibrating system can be lead, but by means of an extension pf the. driver part. The vibrating system can serve to control a single thread or also to control a plurality of threads simultaneously. In this case, the driver part can be constructed in accordance with Claim 16 as a metal heald frame.<br><br>
