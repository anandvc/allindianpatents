Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a technology and method whereby a faster, broader<br>
and stronger immune response Is obtained when using viral and DNA-based<br>
vaccines.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Despite current knowledge in the field of immunology especially regarding vaccine<br>
technologies no suitable vaccines are available against numerous pathogens.<br>
Widespread pandemics of HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus), HTLV (Human T-<br>
cell Lymphotropic Virus), tuberculosis and HCV (Hepatitis C virus) remain out of<br>
reach of effective vaccination, while bird flu and other emerging pathogens threaten<br>
to overwhelm our healthcare systems. Similarly, the burst in world wide terrorism<br>
has expanded the potential epidemics to include exotic and lethal pathogens such<br>
as Ebola, Lassa and Marburg.<br>
Vaccines can be prophylactic: they are given before the actual infection occurs, or<br>
therapeutic: where they elicit or accelerate an immune response to a pathogen<br>
already in the body. Both methods of vaccination require the establishment of a solid<br>
immune response. The immune response that is activated by infection or<br>
vaccination depends on the interaction of several cell types, such as T-, B- and<br>
antigen presenting cells as well as several different molecules, primarily antigens,<br>
MHC molecules, T- and B-cells receptors and many more.<br>
Antigens are peptide fragments presented on the surface of antigen presenting cells<br>
by MHC molecules. Antigens can be of foreign, i.e. pathogenic origin, or stem from<br>
the organism itself, so called self or auto antigens. The MHC molecules are<br>
representatives of a polymorphous gene family encoded by a specific chromosomal<br>
region known as the "major histocompatibility complex", hence MHC. Two classes of<br>
MHC molecules exist, MHC class I (MHC-I) and MHC class II (MHC-II).<br>
T-helper cells are stimulated by antigens presented by MHC class II (MHC-II)<br>
molecules residing on the surface of antigen presenting cells. The MHC-II molecules<br>
are synthesized in the endoplasmatic reticulum. During synthesis, they combine with<br>
invariant chain (li) in a manner preventing the MHC-II molecules from being loaded<br>
with self- or auto-antigens. The MHC-II molecule is by signal sequences in the<br>
invariant chain transported to the cell surface in a specific cellular compartment. As<br>
the compartment matures by the processing of its contents it progresses from being<br>
a lysosome, to a late endosome (after fusion with endocytotic vesicles) to an MHC<br>
class II compartment (MHC). The.endocytotic vesicle contains foreign antigen i.e.<br>
proteolytically cleaved bacterial peptide fragments. These fragments are by their<br>
degradation prepared to be loaded onto the MHC-II molecule. The MHC-tl molecule<br>
is released by the invariant chain in a two part process when the invariant chain first<br>
is degraded proteolytically leaving only a peptide termed CLIP in the MHC-lf binding<br>
domain, secondly by the removal of CLIP by an HLA-DM molecule. The MHC-II<br>
molecule is then free to bind the foreign antigens and present these on the cell<br>
surface after fusion of the MIIC vesicle to the plasma membrane. This initiates the<br>
humoral immune response as the presented antigen stimulates activation of a T-<br>
helper cell which in turn by several means activates a B cell, which ultimately<br>
differentiates into an antibody secreting cell.<br>
The cellular immune response is initiated when the T-cell receptor of T-cytotoxic<br>
cells recognizes antigen bound to the MHC class I molecule on an antigen<br>
presenting cell. MHC-I molecules are not associated with a moiecuie of a<br>
functionality like the invariant chain that associates with MHC-II. The processing of<br>
MHC-I into an antigen presenting molecule furthermore differs from that of MHC-II<br>
molecules in that the MHC-1 molecule is loaded with antigen already In the<br>
endoplasmatic reticulum. The antigens presented by the MHC-I molecule are<br>
typically peptide fragments cleaved by the proteasome of proteins that have been<br>
synthesized by the antigen presenting cell itself. These proteins may be abnormal<br>
proteins encoded in the cells own DNA or proteins derived from viruses or other<br>
pathogens that have infected the cell and parasitize its protein synthesis machinery.<br>
The MHC class 1-related proteolytic system is present in virtually all cells.<br>
The functions of the two types of T cells are significantly different, as implied by their<br>
names. Cytotoxic T cells eradicate intracellular pathogens and tumors by direct lysis<br>
of celts and by secreting cytokines such as y-interferon. The predominant cytotoxic T<br>
cell is the CD8+ T cell, which also is antigen specific. Helper T cells also can lyse<br>
cells, but their primary function is to secrete cytokines that promote the activities of<br>
B cells (antibody-producing cells) and other T cells and thus they broadly enhance<br>
the immune response to foreign antigens, including antibody-mediated and cytotoxic<br>
T cell-mediated response mechanisms. CD4+ T cells are the major helper T cell<br>
phenotype in the immune response.<br>
Traditional vaccines rely on whole organisms, either pathogenic strains that have<br>
been killed or strains with attenuated pathogenicity. On the one hand, these<br>
vaccines run the risk of introducing the disease they are designed to prevent if the<br>
attenuation is insufficient or if enough organisms survive the killing step during<br>
vaccine preparation. On the other hand, such vaccines have reduced infectivity and<br>
are often insufficiently immunogenic, resulting in inadequate protection from the<br>
vaccination.<br>
Recently, molecular biological techniques have been used in an attempt to develop<br>
new vaccines based on individual antigenic proteins from the pathogenic organisms.<br>
Conceptually, use of antigenic peptides rather than whole organisms would avoid<br>
pathogenicity while providing a vaccine containing the most immunogenic antigens.<br>
However, it has proven difficult to select the optimal antigen of a given protein or<br>
polypeptide and furthermore it has been found that pure peptides or carbohydrates<br>
tend to be weak immunogens.<br>
Genetic (DNA) vaccines are new and promising candidates for the development of<br>
both prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines. The strength of the ensuing immune<br>
response is determined through a combination of the potency of the vector (i.e.<br>
naked DNA, viral vectors, live attenuated viruses etc.), the expression level of the<br>
antigen, and the recombinant antigen it self (i.e. high or low affinity MHC binders,<br>
structural determinants selecting for more or less limited T-or B-cell repertoire etc.).<br>
It is generally held to be true, that efficient induction of immunological memory<br>
requires or benefits from the interactions of CD4+ (helper cell) T-cells with CD8+<br>
(cytotoxic) T-cells and B-cells that mediate many of the effects of immune memory.<br>
However, one potential disadvantage of conventional DNA vaccines is their low<br>
immunogenicity in humans. One likely cause of this low immunogenicity is the<br>
restricted access of antigens formed within cells to the MHC II pathway for antigen<br>
processing and presentation to T helper cells.<br>
Summary of Invention<br>
Thus, the present invention has solved the problem of stimulating the immune<br>
response in a manner that increases the kinetics of the response, simultaneously<br>
with both broadening and improving the response, while avoiding, among other<br>
things, the above mentioned disadvantages of the vaccination methods described in<br>
the state of the art. In particular, a novel system for a directed, specific and fast<br>
stimulation of the immune system is hereby made available in order to improve the<br>
vaccination of all animals.<br>
This problem is solved by the embodiments of the present invention characterized in<br>
the claims. By the present invention it was found that fusion of an antigen to the<br>
invariant chain dramatically enhanced the ensuing antiviral CD4+ and CD8* T-cell<br>
responses. Additionally, and surprisingly, it was found that this effect is obtained<br>
through a CD4+ T-cell independent mechanism. It was further found that the<br>
protection is both accelerated and enhanced in an acute localized and lethal<br>
infection, and enhanced in a high-dose systemic infection.<br>
It is thus an object of the present invention to provide a nucleic acid construct<br>
comprising sequences encoding at least one invariant chain operatively linked to at<br>
least one antigenic protein or peptide or an antigenic fragment of said protein or<br>
peptide.<br>
It is likewise an aspect of the present invention to provide an adenoviral vector<br>
comprising a nucleotide construct encoding at least one antigen and at least one<br>
protein or peptide or fragment of a protein or peptide which stimulates an immune<br>
response.<br>
Thus it is an aspect of the present invention to provide means of stimulating an<br>
MHC-l  mediated immune response by an adenoviral vector comprising a nucleotide<br>
construct encoding at least one antigen and at least one protein or peptide or<br>
fragment of a protein or peptide.<br>
Another aspect includes stimulating an MHC-I I response by an adenoviral vector<br>
comprising a nucleotide construct encoding at least one antigen and at least one<br>
protein or peptide or fragment of a protein or peptide.<br>
A further aspect provides means of stimulating intercellular spreading of the nucleic<br>
acid construct, the adenoviral vector, the proteins encoded within any of these or<br>
any parts of any of these.<br>
It is further an Object of the present invention to provide a delivery vehicle<br>
comprising the nucleic acid construct as detailed herein, especially a delivery<br>
vehicle such as a replication deficient adenoviral vector is relevant to the present<br>
invention.<br>
It is yet an object and an aspect of the present invention to provide a cell comprising<br>

invention.<br>
It is yet an object of the present invention to provide a chimeric protein as encoded<br>
by the nucleic acid construct described herein or encoded by the adenoviral vector<br>
described herein.<br>
It is further an aspect of the present invention to provide an antibody that recognizes<br>
the chimeric protein encoded by either the nucleic acid construct or the adenoviral<br>
vector described herein.<br>
It is an aspect of the present invention to provide a vaccine comprising the nucleic<br>
acid construct or the adenoviral vector as detailed herein. Especially relevant to the<br>
present invention is a vaccine, where at least one invariant chain is operatively<br>
linked to at least one protein or peptide or fragment of a protein or peptide which<br>
stimulates an MHC-I response. This may be done by operatively linking at least one<br>
invariant chain with at least one at least one antigenic protein or peptide or an<br>
antigenic fragment of said protein or peptide.<br>
It is further an aspect of the present invention to provide a vaccine comprising the<br>
chimeric protein encoded within the nucleic acid construct or the adenoviral vector<br>
as detailed herein.<br>
It is yet an aspect of the present invention to provide a kit in parts, said kit<br>
comprising either a vaccine composition comprising an adenoviral vector or a<br>
nucleic acid construct as described herein together with a medical instrument or<br>
other means of administering said vaccine and furthermore instructions on how to<br>
use the kit in parts.<br>

response in an animal, by administering to the animal a vaccine comprising the<br>
nucleic acid construct or the adenoviral vector as detailed herein below.<br>

Vaccine: A substance or composition capable of inducing an immune response in<br>
an animal. Also referred to as an immunogenic composition in the present text. An<br>
immune response being an immune response (humoral/antibody and/or celiular)<br>
inducing memory in an organism, resulting in the infectious agent, being met by a   .<br>
secondary rather than a primary response, thus reducing its impact on the host<br>
organism. A vaccine of the present invention may be given as or prophylactic and/or<br>
therapeutic medicament. The composition may comprise one or more of the<br>
following: antigen(s), nucleic acid constructs comprising one or more antigens<br>
operatively linked to li, carriers,.adjuvants and pharmaceutical carriers..<br>
Variant: a 'variant' of a given reference nucleic acid or polypeptide refers to a<br>
nucleic acid or polypeptide that displays a certain degree of sequence<br>
homology/identity to said reference nucleic acid or polypeptide but is not identical to<br>
said reference nucleic acid or polypeptide.<br>
The present invention relates to a vaccine comprising a nucleic acid construct such<br>
as a DNA construct especially a nucleic acid construct comprising sequences<br>
encoding invariant chain operatively linked to antigenic protein or peptide encoding<br>
sequences. The vaccine stimulates an immune response, especially an immune<br>
response in an MHC-I dependent, but CD4+ T-cell independent manner.<br>
Nucleic acid construct<br>
An aspect of the present invention relates to nucleic acid constructs comprising<br>
sequences encoding at least one invariant chain operatively linked to at least one<br>
antigenic protein or peptide or an antigenic fragment of said protein or peptide, in<br>
short an antigen.<br>
By nucleic acid construct is understood a genetically engineered nucleic acid. The<br>
nucleic acid construct may be a non-replicating and linear nucleic acid, a circular<br>
expression vector, an autonomously replicating piasmid or viral expression vector. A<br>
nucleic acid construct may comprise several elements such as, but not limited to<br>
genes or fragments of same, promoters, enhancers, terminators, poly-A tails,<br>
linkers, polylinkers, operative linkers, multiple cloning sites (MCS), markers, STOP<br>
codons, internal ribosomal entry sites (IRES) and host homologous sequences for<br>
integration or other defined elements. Methods for engineering nucleic acid<br>
constructs are well known in the art (see, e.g., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory<br>
Manual, Sambrook et al., eds., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, 2nd Edition, Cold<br>
Spring Harbor, N.Y., 1989).<br>
Examples of parts of nucleic acid constructs are given in figures 1,15 and 16, as<br>
well as in the sequences identified as SEQ ID NO: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. The partial<br>
vector sequences of SEQ ID NO: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 have been generated by<br>
subcloning various elements as described in the above and as illustrated in figures<br>
1,15 and 16. These partial sequences are all inserted into the pAC-CMVpLpARS(+)<br>
vector (Becker et al., 1994, Methods Cell Biol. 43 Pt A:161-189), see GenBank<br>
accession number AY590429.1.<br>
Invariant chain<br>
The invariant chain (li) or CD74, is a non-polymorphic type I! integral membrane<br>
protein, see SEQ ID NOs: 2 and 4 for the amino acid sequences of human and<br>
mouse li, respectively, and likewise SEQ ID NOs: 1 and 3 for the nucleic acid<br>
sequences of human and mouse li, respectively. Invariant chain has multiple<br>
functions in lymphocyte maturation and in adaptive immune responses, in particular<br>
targeting to lysosomal compartments were the li CLIP sequence can occupy MHC<br>
class II molecules until these are fused with endosomal compartments (Pieters J.<br>
1997, Curr. Opin. Immunol., 9:8996). Additionally li has been shown to function as<br>
an MHC class I chaperone (Morris et al, 2004, Immunol. Res. 30:171-179) and by tts<br>
endosomal targeting sequence, to facilitate stimulation of CD4+, but not CD8+ T-cells<br>
directed against covalently linked antigen (Diebold et al., 2001, Gene Ther. 8:487-<br>
493).<br>
The invariant chain protein comprises several domains: a cytosolic domain which<br>
includes a signal or sorting peptide (also known as the lysosomal targeting<br>
sequence), a transmembrane domain, and a luminal domain which in itself<br>
comprises a CLIP region, KEY region, core domain and trimerization domain. Both<br>
of these domains are flanked by highly flexible regions (Strumptner-Cuvelette &amp;<br>
Benaroch, 2002, Biochem. Biophys. Acta., 1542:1-13). Invariant chain has been<br>
characterized in several organisms, including vertebrates (e.g. chicken), mammals<br>
(e.g. cow, dog, mouse and rat) and human.<br>
The present invention relates to nucleic acid constructs comprising sequences<br>
wherein at least one invariant chain is organism specific or can be related to a<br>
specific organism. Preferably, at least one invariant chain is of vertebrate origin,<br>
more preferably of mammalian origin and most preferably of human origin. In<br>
relation hereto the sequence defined by SEQ ID NO: 1 is the nucleic acid sequence<br>
of the invariant chain from human. The employed invariant chain is preferably the<br>
invariant chain of the organism that is to receive the vaccination. It is an object of the<br>
present invention that the invariant chain and the host organisms or receivers of the<br>
treatment are of the same species.<br>
The present invention also relates to a nucleic acid construct wherein the encoded<br>
at least one invariant chain is a fragment of the sequence identified in SEQ ID NO: 2<br>
of at least 40 amino acids and of at least 85% identity to the same fragment of SEQ<br>
ID NO: 2.<br>
The fragment is a fragment of at least 40 amino acids from any part of the invariant<br>

listed expanding up to 5 residues to either side hereof. It further includes fragment of<br>
at least 50 residues, of at least 60 residues, of at least 70 residues, of at least 80<br>
residues, of at least 90 residues, of at least 100 residues, of at least 110 residues, of<br>
at least 120 residues, of at least 130 residues, of at least 140 residues, of at least<br>
150 residues, of at least 160 residues, of at least 170 residues, of at least 180<br>
residues of at least 190 residues, of at least 200 residues and of at least 210<br>
residues.<br>
Any of the above described fragments of at least 85 % sequence identity, for<br>
example at least 90 % sequence identity, for example at least 91% sequence<br>
identity, such as at least 92 % sequence identity, for example at least 93 %<br>
sequence identity, such as at least 94 % sequence identity, for example at least 95<br>
% sequence Identity, such as at least 96 % sequence identity, for example at least<br>
97% sequence identity, such as at least 98 % sequence identity, for example 99%<br>
sequence identity with SEQ ID NO: 2 are included within the scope of the present<br>
invention.<br>
The identity/homology between amino acid sequences may be calculated using well<br>
known scoring matrices such as any one of BLOSUM 30, BLOSUM 40, BLOSUM<br>
45, BLOSUM 50, BLOSUM 55, BLOSUM 60, BLOSUM 62, BLOSUM 65, BLOSUM<br>
70, BLOSUM 75, BLOSUM 80, BLOSUM 85, and BLOSUM 90.<br>
Preferably, the present invention is a nucleic acid construct wherein the encoded at<br>
least one invariant chain is a fragment of the SEQ ID NO: 2 of at least 186 amino<br>
acids. This includes any of the fragments as defined above, and which thus share<br>
identity with the sequence of the invariant chain of SEQ ID NO: 2.<br>
The present invention furthermore relates to a nucleic acid construct wherein the<br>
encoded at least one invariant chain is at least 85% identical to SEQ ID NO: 2.<br>
This encompasses that any sequence derived from the invariant chain as put<br>
forward in SEQ ID NO: 2 of at least 85 % sequence identity, for example at least 90<br>
% sequence identity, for example at least 91% sequence identity, such as at feast<br>
92 % sequence identity, for example at least 93 % sequence identity, such as at<br>
least 94 % sequence identity, for example at least 95 % sequence identity, such as<br>
at least 96 % sequence identity, for example at least 97% sequence identity, such<br>
as at least 98 % sequence identity, for example 99% sequence homology with SEQ<br>
ID NO: 2 are included within the scope of the present invention. This includes<br>
sequences that are either longer or shorter than the sequence described in SEQ ID<br>
NO: 2.<br>
Most preferably, the present invention relates to a nucleic acid construct wherein the<br>
encoded at least one invariant chain is identical to SEQ ID NO: 2.<br>
Any of the above described sequences regardless of origin, sequence identity or<br>
length are from hereon termed variants of invariant chain.<br>
It follows, that it is within the scope of the present invention that a variant of invariant<br>
chain from any organism may be a variant according to the above, i.e. that the<br>
variant may be a fragment of the invariant chain of an organism and/or be at least<br>
85% identical to said invariant chain either over ail the sequence of the invariant<br>
chain or within the fragment of same. The invariant chain may also be from a related<br>
species of organism or be from a distantly related species.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention relates to the addition, removal or<br>
substitution of regions, peptides or domains of the at least one invariant chain as<br>
encoded by the nucleic acid construct. The removal of one or more of these regions,<br>
peptides or domains will truncate the resulting invariant chain. The addition or<br>
replacement of a region, peptide or domain includes the options of choosing these<br>
sequences from known sources such as naturally occurring proteins or polypeptides<br>
or from artificially synthesized polypeptides or nucleic adds encoding the same. The<br>
addition of regions, domains or peptides includes the option of adding one, two or<br>
more of each type or of different types of regions, domains, peptides and one, two,<br>
three or more of the nucleic acids encoding these regions, domains and peptides.<br>
These may be identical or differ from one another based on the sequence. The<br>
regions, peptides and domains need not arise from the same organism as the<br>
scaffold invariant chain, ft is well Icnown in the art to perform additions, deletions and<br>
substitutions of individual as well as stretches of nucleotides which will encode the<br>
resulting polypeptide.<br>
Aligning nucleic acid and especially protein sequences of homologous genes or<br>
proteins from different organisms can be of great assistance when determining<br>
which substitutions, deletions, rearrangements or other alterations it would be<br>
beneficial to construct. Aligning human and murine invariant chain sequences as<br>
illustrated below, gives an indication of which amino acid residues may be of<br>
importance for the structure and function of the invariant chain in these organisms -<br>
these are the residues which are conserved between the two sequences. Likewise,<br>
the presumably less important residues are the ones in which the sequences differ.<br>
It is. of interest in regard to the present invention to perform substitutions and/or<br>
deletions of the variant residues / regions. When attempting to mutate or delete or<br>
otherwise alter the sequence of e.g. the human invariant chain in order to improve<br>
its immune response stimulating capacity, it may also be relevant to examine the<br>
conserved residues and make e.g. homologous substitutions (i.e. substitutions<br>
where the amino acids are considered to be of e.g. same structural quality, polarity,<br>
hydrophobicity or other).<br><br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention relates to the at least one invariant<br>
chain wherein the signal peptide is removed, replaced or added onto the sequence<br>
encoding the invariant chain. A signal peptide is a short sequence of amino acids<br>
that determine the eventual location of a protein in the cell, also referred to as a<br>
sorting peptide. Signal peptides that determine the location of proteins to subcellular<br>
compartments such as the endoplasmatic reticulum, golgi apparatus and the various<br>
compartments comprising the golgi apparatus, the nucleus, the plasma membrane,<br>
mitochondria and the various spaces and membranes herein, peroxisomes,<br>
lysosomes, endosomes and secretory vesicles among others are all included within<br>
the scope of the present invention. A preferred embodiment comprises alone the<br>
lysosomal targeting sequence of invariant chain. Another preferred embodiment<br>
comprises alone the KEY region of invariant chain.<br><br>
Another preferred embodiment of the present invention relates to the removal,<br>
addition, or replacement of the CLIP region of the at least one invariant chain. As<br>
described above, the addition or replacement of the CLIP region includes the<br>
options of adding or replacing the existing CLIP region in the variant of the invariant<br>
chain or chains chosen, with CLIP regions from invariant chains of the same or other<br>
organisms or of variants of CLIP regions form the same or other organisms. The<br>
variant CLIP regions may, as follows from the above, be specifically generated<br>
mutant versions of the CLIP region, generated by single or multiple nucleic acid<br>
substitutions, deletions or additions. A preferred embodiment comprises the CLIP<br>
region alone, or the CLIP region together with the N-terminally adjacent sequence or<br>
the C-terminally adjacent sequence without any other regions or domains of<br>
invariant chain. Other preferred embodiments comprise alone the N-terminally or C-<br>
terminally adjacent sequences to the CLIP region but without the CLIP region itself.<br>
By adjacent is meant any amino acids within 10 residues of the CLIP region, within<br>
20 residues, within 30 residues, within 40 residues, within 50 residues, within 75<br>
residues or within 100 residues of the CLIP region.<br>
An embodiment of the present invention relates to fragments of invariant chain as<br>
described above without the CLIP region. These fragments may be at least 5 amino<br>
acid residues long, at least 10 residues, at least 15 residues, at least 20 residues, at<br>
least 25 residues, at least 30 residues or at least 35 residues in length. Another<br>
embodiment relates to fragments of invariant chain wherein the signal peptide is<br>
removed and the invariant chain fragment is at least 10 amino acid residues long, at<br>
least 15 residues, at least 20 residues, at least 25 residues, at least 30 residues, at<br>
least 35 residues, at least 50 residues at least 60 residues, at least 70 residues at<br>
least 80 residues, at least 90 residues, at least 100 residues, at least 110 residues<br>
at feast 120 residues at least 130 residues, at least 140 residues, at least 150<br>
residues, at least 160 residues, at least 170 residues, or at least 180 residues in<br>
length.<br>

antigens or cancer antigens. In general, any antigen that Is found to be associated<br>
with cancer tumors may be used. One way in which cancer specific antigens may be<br>
found is by subtraction analyses such as various micro array analyses, such as DNA<br>
microarray analysis. Herein the gene expression pattern (as seen in the level of<br>
RNA or protein encoded by said genes) between healthy and cancerous patients,<br>
between groups of cancerous patients or between healthy and cancerous tissue in<br>
the same patient is compared. The genes that have approximately equal expression<br>
levels are "subtracted" from each other leaving the genes / gene products that differ<br>
between the healthy and cancerous tissue. This approach is known in the art and<br>
may be used as a method of identifying novel cancer antigens or to create a gene<br>
expression profile specific for a given patient or group of patients. Antigens this<br>
identified, both single antigen and the combinations in which they may have been<br>
found fall within the scope of the present invention.<br>

of examples of hereof includes diseases such rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus<br>
erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, psoriasis and Crohn's disease.<br>
Operative linker<br>
An aspect of the present invention relates to the nucleic acid construct wherein the<br>
operative link between the invariant chain and the antigenic protein or peptide or<br>
fragment of antigenic protein or peptide either is a direct link or a link mediated by a<br>
spacer region. By the term operative linker is understood a sequence of nucleotides<br>
or amino acid residues that bind together two parts of a nucleic acid construct or<br>
chimeric polypeptide in a manner securing the biological processing of the nucleic<br>
acid or polypeptide. If the operative linker is a direct link, the two nucleic acids each<br>
encoding either an open reading frame or a fragment of an open reading frame are<br>
placed immediately adjacent to each other and thereby also in frame. If the<br>
operative linker is mediated by a spacer region, a series of nucleotides are inserted<br>
between the nucleotides encoding the at least one invariant chain and the at least<br>
one antigenic peptide, respectively. It is within the scope of the present invention<br>
having a spacer region wherein the spacer region merely is a series of nucleotides<br>
linking the at least two elements of the present invention in a manner retaining the<br>
open reading frames, or the spacer region may encode one or more signals or<br>
separate elements as defined herein below.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the invention comprises an operative linker, wherein the<br>
operative linker is a spacer region.<br>
In a more preferred embodiment the invention comprises a spacer region encoding<br>
at least one helper epitope for class. II MHC molecules. An example of a helper<br>
epitope is an immunogenic determinant such as Diphtheria toxin. Especially<br>
Diphtheria toxin B fragment COOH-terminal region has been shown to be<br>
immunogenic in mice. Furthermore, HSP70, in part or in whole, as well as other<br>
immunogenic peptides, such as influenza viral or immunogenic sequences or<br>
peptides with an anchoring motif to HLA class I and class II molecules, also may be<br>
encoded in the spacer region of the nucleic acid construct.<br>
In another preferred embodiment the spacer region of the nucleic acid construct<br>
encodes at least one protease cleavage site. Cleavage sites of lysosomal proteases<br>
such as cathepsins, aspartate proteases and zinc proteases as well as other<br>
intracellular proteases fall within the scope of the present invention.<br>
In yet a preferred embodiment the operative linker of the nucleic acid construct may<br>
comprise at least one siRNA or miRNA encoding sequence. siRNAs (small<br>
interfering RNAs) and miRNAs (microRNAs) target endogenous RNAs, in a<br>
sequence-specific manner, for degradation. An siRNA or mIRNA encoded within the<br>
nucleic acid construct of the present invention may thus be chosen to target an<br>
undesirable gene product.<br>
In a more preferred embodiment the operative linker comprises at least one<br>
polylinker or multiple cloning site (MCS). Polylinkers and MCS's are series of<br>
nucleotides comprising restriction enzyme recognition sequences, i.e. sites where a<br>
restriction enzyme cut the DNA in blunt or staggered manner facilitating the<br>
subcloning of other fragments / sequences of DNA into the nucleic acid construct.<br>
The recognition sequences of the polylinkers / MCS's are typically unique meaning<br>
that they are not found elsewhere on the nucleic acid construct. The operative linker<br>
may furthermore comprise one or more stop or termination codons that signal the<br>
release of the nascent polypeptide from the ribosome. The operative linker may also<br>
comprise at least one IRES (Internal Ribosomal Entry Site) and / or at least one<br>
promoter. An IRES is a nucleotide sequence that allows for translation initiation in<br>
the middle of a messenger RNA (mRNA) sequence as part of the greater process of<br>
protein synthesis. A promoter is a DNA sequence that enables a gene to be<br>
transcribed. The promoter is recognized by RNA polymerase, which then initiates<br>
transcription, see in the below. The promoter may be single or bidirectional.<br>
In a very preferred embodiment the operative linker spanning the region between<br>
the invariant chain and the at least one antigen is an operative linker comprising at<br>
least one poiylinker, and at least one promoter, and optionally also at least one<br>
IRES. These elements may be placed in any order. In a further preferred<br>
embodiment, the STOP codon of the invariant chain has been deleted, and the<br>
poiylinker has been cloned into the vector in a manner conserving the open reading<br>
frame allowing for in frame reading of the at least one antigen that is inserted into<br>
the poiylinker. This has the advantage of facilitating subcloning of multiple antigens<br>
into the same construct in one step or in multiple cloning steps and allowing for the<br>
simultaneous expression of multiple antigens in the same frame as the invariant<br>
chain. A STOP codon may be inserted after the poiylinker for translation termination.<br>
This embodiemtn may be combined with any of the above helper epitopes,<br>
mi/siRNAs or any of the other elements herein described.<br>
An embodiment of the present invention relates to the placement of the operative<br>
linker in relations to the at least one invariant chain and the at least one antigenic<br>
protein or peptide or fragment of said protein or peptide, wherein the at antigenic<br>
peptide encoding sequences are placed: within the invariant chain sequence, at the<br>
front end of the invariant chain sequence, at the terminal part of the invariant chain<br>
sequence. This is done in a manner ensuring the readability of the open reading<br>
frame of the construct, so that the antigenic peptide is: preceded, surrounded or<br>
rounded off by, at least one operative linker.<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention further relates to the placement of<br>
the operative linker in relations to the at least one invariant chain and the at least<br>
one antigenic protein or peptide or fragment of said protein or peptide, wherein the<br>
at least one antigenic peptide encoding sequence preferably is placed at the<br>
terminal part of the invariant chain and an operative linker is inserted herein<br>
between. The terminal part being the first or last residue of the invariant chain or<br>
fragment hereof.<br>
Combinations<br>
It is within.the scope of the present invention that the nucleic acid construct encodes<br>
a plurality of elements. The elements being the at least one invariant chain and the<br>
at least one antigenic protein or peptide or fragment of said protein or peptide. It<br>
therefore falls within the scope of the present invention to have a plurality of<br>
Invariant chains each of these being operatively linked to each other and to a<br>
plurality of antigenic proteins or peptides or fragments of antigenic proteins or<br>
peptides, wherein these also are operatively linked. The elements of the nucleic acid<br>
construct must thus be operatively linked to each other. Several series of invariant<br>
chains each operatively linked to one antigenic protein or peptide or fragment of said<br>
protein or peptide, each of these series being operatively linked to each other are<br>
encompassed within the present invention.<br>
Advantages and very important aspects of the present invention relate to the fact<br>
that any type of immune response e.g. T cell mediated and antibody mediated<br>
responses, can be initiated, both with epitopes known to be weak antigens, with<br>
polypeptides of unknown antigenic properties, and with multiple epitopes/antigens<br>
simultaneously.<br>
It is therefore also within the scope of the present invention that a preferred<br>
embodiment is a nucleic acid construct encoding at least one invariant chain<br>
operatively linked to a plurality of antigenic proteins or peptides or fragment of<br>
proteins or peptides, such as two, three, four, five, six, eight, ten, twelve or more<br>
antigenic proteins or peptides or fragment of proteins or peptides.<br>
The nucleic acid construct may comprise additional elements. These include but are<br>
not limited to: internal ribosomal entry sites (IRES), genes encoding proteins related<br>
to antigen presentation such as LAMP, calreticulin and Hsp70, genes encoding<br>
proteins that are related to intracellular spreading such as VP22, HIV Tat, Cx43 or<br>
other connexins and intercellular gap-junction constituents, genes encoding natural<br>
killer cell (NK-cell) activation molecules such as H60 and cytokines, chicken<br>
ovalbumin, or any T-helper cell epitope.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention the nucleic acid construct<br>
comprises at least one gene encoding a protein related to antigen presentation such<br>
as LAMP, LIMP, calreticulin or Hsp70.<br>
In yet a preferred embodiment of the present invention the nucleic acid construct<br>
comprises at least one gene encoding a protein related to intracellular spreading<br>
such as VP22, Cx43, HIV Tat, other connexins or intercellular gap-junction<br>
constituents.<br>
Promoter<br>
The term promoter will be used here to refer to a group of transcriptional control<br>
modules that are clustered around the initiation site for RNA polymerase li. Much of<br>
the thinking about how promoters are organized derives from analyses of several<br>
viral promoters, including those for the HSV thymidine kinase (tk) and SV40 early<br>
transcription units. These studies, augmented by more recent work, have shown that<br>
promoters are composed of discrete functional modules, each consisting of<br>
approximately 7-20 bp of DNA, and containing one or more recognition sites for<br>
transcriptional activator proteins. At least one module in each promoter functions to<br>
position the start site for RNA synthesis. The best known example of this is the<br>
TATA box, but in some promoters lacking a TATA box, such as the promoter for the<br>
mammalian terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase gene and the promoter for the SV<br>
40 late genes, a discrete element overlying the start site itself helps to fix the place<br>
of initiation.<br>
Additional promoter elements regulate the frequency of transcriptional initiation.<br>
Typically, these are located in the region 30-110 bp upstream of the start site,<br>
although a number of promoters have recently been shown to contain functional<br>
elements downstream of the start site as well. The spacing between elements is<br>
flexible, so that promoter function is preserved when elements are inverted or<br>
moved relative to one another. In the tk promoter, the spacing between elements<br>
can be increased to 50 bp apart before activity begins to decline. Depending on the<br>
promoter, it appears that individual elements can function either cooperatively or<br>
independently to activate transcription. Any promoter that can direct transcription<br>
initiation of the sequences encoded by the nucleic acid construct may be used in the<br>
invention.An aspect of the present invention comprises the nucleic acid construct wherein the<br>
at least one operatively linked invariant chain and antigenic protein or peptide<br>
encoding sequence is preceded by a promoter enabling expression of the construct<br>
It is a further aspect that the promoter is selected from the group of constitutive<br>
promoters, inducible promoters, organism specific promoters, tissue specific<br>
promoters and cell type specific promoters.<br>
Examples of promoters include, but are not limited to: constitutive promoters such<br>
as: simian virus 40 (SV40) early promoter, a mouse mammary tumor virus promoter,<br>
a human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat promoter, a Moloney virus<br>
promoter, an avian leukaemia virus promoter, an Epstein-Barr virus immediate early<br>
promoter, a Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) promoter, a human actin promoter, a human<br>
myosin promoter, a human haemoglobin promoter, cytomegalovirus (CMV)<br>
promoter and a human muscle creatine promoter, inducible promoters such as: a<br>
metallothionine promoter, a glucocorticoid promoter, a progesterone promoter, and<br>
a tetracycline promoter (tet-on or tet-off), tissue specific promoters such as: HER-2<br>
promoter and PSA associated promoter and bidirectional promoters, that are<br>
capable of initiating transcription in either direction from the promoter.<br>
Advantages of using an inducible promoter includes the option of providing a<br>
"dormant" vaccine that can be activated at will. This may be of use if the vaccination<br>
preferably only is induced locally vs. systemically within a body (e.g. in cases<br>
involving-cancer), or the vaccine is detrimental to the health of the recipient at the<br>
time of vaccination.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the nucleic acid construct comprises a promoter selected<br>
from the group of: CMV promoter, SV40 promoter and RSV promoter.<br>
Delivery vehicle<br>
An aspect of the present invention comprises the nucleic acid construct as<br>
described in any of the above, comprised within a delivery vehicle. A delivery vehicle<br>
is an entity whereby a nucleotide sequence or polypeptide or both can be<br>
transported from at least one media to another. Delivery vehicles are generally used<br>
for expression of the sequences encoded within the nucleic acid construct and/or for<br>
he intracellular delivery of the construct or the polypeptide encoded therein. It is<br>
within the scope of the present invention that the delivery vehicle is a vehicle<br>
selected from the group of: RNA based vehicles, DNA based vehicles/ vectors, lipid<br>
based vehicles, virally based vehicles and cell based vehicles. Examples of such<br>
delivery vehicles include, but are not limited to: biodegradable polymer<br>
microspheres, lipid based formulations such as liposome carriers, coating the<br>
construct onto colloidal gold particles, lipopolysaccharides, polypeptides,<br>
polysaccharides, and pegylation of viral vehicles.<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention regards delivery of the nucleic acid<br>
construct as naked DNA by mechanical or electrical techniques. Especially the<br>
coating of the nucleic acid construct upon gold particles is a favoured embodiment.<br>
The delivery of the nucleic acid construct upon gold particles is done by ballistic<br>
transfer using particle bombardment equipment such as a gene gun.<br>
A more preferred embodiment of the present invention comprises a virus as a<br>
delivery vehicle, where the virus is selected from the non-exhaustive group of:<br>
adenoviruses, retroviruses, lentiviruses, adeno-associated viruses, herpesviruses,<br>
vaccinia viruses, foamy viruses, cytomegaloviruses, Semliki forest virus, poxviruses,<br>
RNA virus vector and DNA virus vector. Such viral vectors are well known in the art.<br>
Viral vectors are often made up of two components, a modified viral genome and a<br>
coat structure surrounding it, although sometimes viral vectors are introduced in<br>
naked form or coated with proteins other than viral proteins. Most current vectors<br>
have coat structures similar to a wild-type virus. This structure packages and<br>
protects the viral nucleic acid and provides the means to bind and enter target cells.<br>
Preferably, viral vectors are modified from wild-type viral genomes to disable the<br>
growth of the virus in a target cell while enabling the virus to grow in a host cell (e.g.<br>
such as a packaging or helper cell) used to prepare infectious particles. Vector<br>
nucleic acids generally essential cis-acting viral sequences for replication and<br>
packaging in a helper line and expression control sequences for regulating the<br>
expression of a polynucleotide being delivered to a target cell. Other viral functions<br>
are expressed in trans in specific packaging or helper cell lines as known in the art.<br>
Adenovirus<br>
In a more preferred embodiment the vehicle comprising the nucleic acid construct as<br>
described herein is an adenovirus. The adenoviral genome consists of a linear<br>
double-stranded DNA molecule of approximately 36 kb carrying more than about<br>
thirty genes necessary to complete the viral replication cycle. The early genes are<br>
divided into 4 regions (E1 to E4) that are essential for viral replication with the<br>
exception of the E3 region, which is believed to modulate the anti-viral host immune<br>
response. The E1 region (EIA and EIB) encodes proteins responsible for the<br>
regulation of transcription of the viral genome. Expression of the E2 region genes<br>
(E2A and E2B) leads to the synthesis of the polypeptides needed for viral<br>
replication. The proteins encoded by the E3 region prevent cytolysis by cytotoxic T<br>
cells and tumor necrosis factor. The proteins encoded by the E4 region are involved<br>
in DNA replication, late gene expression and splicing and host cell shut off. The late<br>
genes generally encode structural proteins contributing to the viral capsid. In<br>
addition, the adenoviral genome carries at cis-acting 5' and 3' iTRs (Inverted<br>
Terminal Repeat) and packaging sequences essential for DNA replication. The ITRs<br>
harbor origins of DNA replication while the encapsidation region is required for the<br>
packaging of adenoviral DNA into infectious particles (see for example US<br>
2004/0157307).<br>
In the most preferred embodiment of the present invention the vehicle comprising<br>
the nucleic acid construct as described herein is a replication defective adenovirus<br>
or a conditionally replication deficient adenovirus. Adenoviral vectors can be<br>
engineered to be conditionally replicative (CRAd vectors) in order to replicate<br>
selectively in specific cells (e.g., such as proliferative cells). In another aspect, an<br>
adenoviral vector is replication-defective for the E1 function (e.g., by total or partial<br>
deletion or mutagenesis of E1). The adenoviral backbone of the vector may<br>
comprise additional modifications (deletions, insertions or mutations in one or more<br>
viral genes). An example of an E2 modification is illustrated by the thermosensitive<br>
mutation localized on the DBP (DNA Binding Protein) encoding gene. The<br>
adenoviral sequence may also be deleted of all or part of the E4 region. Additional<br>
deletions within the non-essential E3 region may allow the size of the polynucleotide<br>
being delivered to be increased. However, it may be advantageous to retain all or<br>
part of the E3 sequences coding for polypeptides (e.g., such as gp19k) allowing the<br>
virus to escape the immune system or inflammatory reactions. Second generation<br><br>
vectors retaining the ITRs and packaging sequences and comprising substantial<br>
genetic modifications to abolish the residual synthesis of the viral antigens also may<br>
be used in order to improve long-term expression of the expressed gene in the<br>
transduced cells. The nucleic acid construct being introduced into the cell may be<br>
inserted in any location of the viral genome, with the exception of the cis-acting<br>
sequences (see for example US 2004/0157307).<br>
Adenoviruses can be derived from any human or animal source, in particular canine,<br>
avian, bovine, murine, ovine, feline, porcine or simian sources or alternatively, may<br>
be a hybrid virus. Any serotype can be employed. However, the human<br>
adenoviruses are preferred and such viruses are available, for example, from the<br>
ATCC (American Type Culture Collection).<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention comprises an adenovirus such as:<br>
Ovine adenovirus, Canine adenovirus type II, Modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) or<br>
MVA-BN.<br>
Adenoviral particles or empty adenoviral capsids also can be used to transfer<br>
nudeic acid constructs or nucleic acid based delivery vectors by a virus-mediated<br>
co-internalization process. This process can be accomplished in the presence of<br>
cationic agent(s) such as polycarbenes or lipid vesicles comprising one or more lipid<br>
layers.<br>
Adenoviral particles may be prepared and propagated according to any conventional<br>
technique in the field of the art using a complementation cell line or a helper virus,<br>
which supplies in trans the missing viral genes necessary for viral replication. The<br>
adenoviral particles can be recovered from the culture supernatant but also from the<br>
cells after lysis and optionally further purified according to standard techniques (e.g.<br>
chromatography and ultracentrifugation).<br>
Cell-type specific targeting may be achieved with vectors derived from adenoviruses<br>
having a broad host range by the modification of viral surface proteins. For example,<br>
the specificity of infection of adenoviruses is determined by the attachment to<br>
cellular receptors present at the surface of permissive cells. In this regard, the fiber<br>
and penton present at the surface of the adenoviral capsid play a critical role in<br>
cellular attachment. Thus, cell targeting of adenoviruses can be carried out by<br>
genetic modification of the viral gene encoding fiber and/or penton, to generate<br>
modified fiber and/or penton capable of specific interaction with unique cell surface<br>
receptors.<br>
An aspect of the present invention relates to an adenoviral vector comprising a<br>
nucleotide construct encoding at least one antigen and at least one protein or<br>
peptide or fragment of a protein or peptide which stimulates an MHC-I response.<br>
A further aspect of the present invention relates to an adenoviral vector, wherein the<br>
nucleotide construct encodes at least one protein or peptide or fragment of a protein<br>
or peptide which stimulates an MHC-I I response.<br>
Preferably, the adenoviral vector comprises sequences, wherein the at least one<br>
antigen is operatively linked to the at least one IVfHC response stimulating protein or<br>
peptide or fragment of an MHC response stimulating protein or peptide. The MHC<br>
stimulating protein or peptide or fragment of protein or peptide is preferably an MHC<br>
associated protein or peptide. Such an MHC associated peptide can be but is not<br>
limited being selected from the group of: ER localizing peptide, Golgi localizing<br>
peptide, endosomal peptide loading compartment localizing peptide, lysosomal,<br>
MIIC, CIIV, melanosomes, secretory granules, Birbeck granules.<br>
More preferably the adenoviral vector comprises an endosomal peptide loading<br>
compartment localizing peptide. Such an endosomal peptide loading compartment<br>
localizing peptide can be, but is not limited to being, selected from the group of:<br>
sorting signal peptides, LAMP, LIMP and invariant chain.<br>
Most preferably the adenoviral vector comprises at least one MHC response<br>
stimulating protein or peptide or fragment of protein or peptide and said MHC<br>
response stimulating protein or peptide or fragment of protein or peptide is invariant<br>
chain.<br>
The adenoviral vector may furthermore comprise proteins that assist in the<br>
spreading of the virus or the construct comprised therein. Such proteins include<br>
connexins, gap-junction related proteins and pore-forming proteins. A preferred<br>
embodiment of the present invention comprises an adenoviral vector encoding or<br>
otherwise comprising any one or more of the following proteins related to<br>
intercellular spreading: VP22, Cx43 and HIV Tat.<br>
Recombinant cell<br>
An aspect of the present invention relates to a cell comprising the nucleic acid<br>
construct as defined in any of the above. Such a recombinant cell can be used a tool<br>
for in vitro research, as a delivery vehicle for the nucleic acid construct or as part of<br>
a gene therapy regime. The nucleic acid construct and nucleic acid based vectors<br>
according to the invention can be introduced into cells by techniques well known in<br>
the art and which include microinjection of DNA into the nucleus of a cell,<br>
transfection, electroporation, lipofection/liposome fusion and particle bombardment.<br>
Suitable cells include autologous and non-autologous cells, and may include<br>
xenogenic cells.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the nucleic acid construct of the present invention is<br>
comprised within an antigen presenting cell (APC). Any cell that presents antigens<br>
on its surface in association with an MHC molecule is considered an antigen<br>
presenting cell. Such cells include but are not limited to macrophages, dendritic<br>
cells, B cells, hybrid APCs, and foster APCs. Methods of making hybrid APCs are<br>
well known in the art.<br>
In a more preferred embodiment the APC is a professional antigen presenting cell<br>
and most preferably the APC is an MHC-I and/or MHC-II expressing cell.<br>
The APC according to any of the above may be a stem cell obtained from a patient.<br>
After introducing the nucleic acid construct of the invention, the stem cell may be<br>
reintroduced into the patient in an attempt to treat the patient of a medical condition.<br>
Preferably, the cell isolated from the patient is a stem cell capable of differentiating<br>
into an antigen presenting cell.<br>
It is furthermore included within the scope of the present invention to that the<br>
antigen presenting cell comprising the nucleic acid construct of the present invention<br>
does not express any co-stimulatory signals and the antigenic protein or peptide or<br>
antigenic fragment of said protein or peptide is an auto-antigen.<br>
Chimeric proteins and antibodies<br>
An object of the present Invention is the chimeric protein encoded by the nucleic<br>
acid constructs as described herein above, comprising at least one operatively<br>
linked invariant chain and at least one antigenic protein or peptide or fragment of<br>
said antigenic protein or peptide. By chimeric protein is understood a genetically<br>
engineered protein that is encoded by a nucleotide sequence made by a splicing<br>
together of two or more complete or partial genes or a series of (non)random nucleic<br>
acids.<br>
An aspect of the present invention relates to an antibody that can recognize the<br>
chimeric protein as defined herein above. By the term antibody is understood<br>
immunoglobulin molecules and active portions of immunoglobulin molecules.<br>
Antibodies are for example intact immunoglobulin molecules or fragments thereof<br>
retaining the immunologic activity. Such antibodies can be used for the passive<br>
immunization of an animal, or for use in an assay for detecting proteins to which the<br>
antibody binds.<br>
Vaccine compositions<br>
An aspect of the present invention relates to a vaccine comprising a nucleic acid<br>
sequence encoding at least one invariant chain operatively linked to at least one<br>
antigenic protein or peptide or fragment of said antigenic protein or peptide. The<br>
vaccine may thus comprise a nucleic acid construct as defined in any of the above.<br>
The vaccine may furthermore be used as a medicament.<br>
The vaccine composition according to the invention can be formulated according to<br>
known methods such as by the admixture of one or more pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carriers, also known as excipients or stabilizers with the active agent.<br>
These excipients may be acceptable for administration to any individual / animal,<br>
preferably to vertebrates and more preferably to humans as they are non-toxic to the<br>
cell or individual being exposed thereto at the dosages and concentrations<br>
employed. Often the physiologically acceptable carrier is an aqueous pH buffered<br>
solution. Examples of such excipients, carriers and methods of formulation may be<br>
found e.g. in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (Maack Publishing Co, Easton,<br>
PA). Examples of physiologically acceptable carriers include but are not limited to:<br>
buffers such as phosphate, citrate, and other organic acids; antioxidants including<br>
ascorbic acid; low molecular weight (less than about 10 residues) polypeptide;<br>
proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers<br>
such as polyvinylpyrrolidone; amino acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine,<br>
arginine or lysine; monosaccharides, disaccharides, and other carbohydrates<br>
including glucose, mannose, or dextrins; chelating agents such as EDTA; sugar<br>
alcohols such as mannitol or sorbitol; salt-forming counterions such as sodium;<br>
and/or nonionic surfactants such as TWEEN.TM., polyethylene glycol (PEG), and<br>
PLURONICS.TM.<br>
To formulate a pharmaceutical^ acceptable composition suitable for effective<br>
administration, such compositions will according to the invention contain an effective<br>
amount of the nucleic acid construct, the nucleic acid construct comprised within a<br>
delivery vehicle or the chimeric protein encoded within the nucleic acid construct as<br>
described herein. Often, if vaccinating with protein or polypeptides as encoded by<br>
the nucleic acid construct of the present invention, a carrier will be used as a<br>
scaffold by coupling the proteins or peptides hereto and thus aiding in the induction<br>
of an immune response. The carrier protein may be any conventional carrier<br>
including any protein suitable for presenting immunogenic determinants. Suitable<br>
carriers are typically large, slowly metabolized macromolecules such as proteins,<br>
polysaccharides, polylactic acids, polyglycolic acids, polymeric amino acids, amino<br>
acid copolymers, lipid aggregates (such as oil droplets or liposomes), and inactive<br>
virus particles. Such carriers are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
Additionally, these carriers may function as immunostimulating agents ("adjuvants").<br>
Immunisation of the animal may be carried out with adjuvants and/or pharmaceutical<br>
carriers. Conventional carrier proteins include, but are not limited to, keyhole limpet<br>
hemocyanin, serum proteins such as transferrin, bovine serum albumin, or human<br>
serum albumin, an ovalbumin, immunoglobulins, or hormones, such as insulin. The<br>
carrier may be present together with an adjuvant or independently here from.<br>
In the following vaccine compositions are meant to encompass compositions useful<br>
for prophylactic and therapeutic use, including stimulating an immune response in a<br>
patient. It is further contemplated that the vaccine composition of the invention does<br>
not induce any systemic or local toxicity reactions or any other side effects.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the nucleic acid construct of the vaccine is packaged.<br>
Packaging means for the nucleic acid construct include means selected from, but<br>
not limited to the group of: RNA based or DNA based vectors, lipid based carriers,<br>
viral expression vectors, viral delivery vectors, cell based vehicles, coating of<br>
colloidal gold particles, biodegradable polymer microspheres. Any of the previously<br>
mentioned delivery means may thus be used for packing purposes for use in a<br>
vaccine composition.<br>
In a more preferred embodiment the packaging means of the nucleic acid construct<br>
for the vaccine is a viral expression vector selected from, but not limited to the group<br>
of: adenovirus, retrovirus, lentivirus, adeno-associated virus, herpes virus, vaccinia<br>
virus and DNA virus vector.<br>
In an even more preferred embodiment the nucleic acid construct of the vaccine is<br>
packaged into an adenoviral vector. In the most preferred embodiment the nudeiq.<br>
acids construct as described in any of the herein above of the vaccine is packaged<br>
in a replication deficient or conditionally replication deficient adenoviral vector.<br>
Adenoviral vectors are described in detail in the above.<br>
An aspect of the invention relates to a vaccine comprising at least two vectors. This<br>
encompasses that any one or two different nucleic acid constructs as described may<br>
be packed into at least two vectors, these vectors being of a type as described in<br>
any of the above. The invention furthermore relates to a vaccine comprising three,<br>
four, five or six vectors. Again, these vectors may differ from one another or not, and<br>
may carry identical or different nucleic acid constructs as described herein above.<br>
A further aspect of the present invention relates to a vaccine comprising at least one<br>
chimeric protein as encoded by any of the nucleic acid constructs described herein.<br>
When a chimeric protein or polypeptide is to be used as an immunogen, it may be<br>
produced by expression of any one or more of the DNA constructs described above<br>
in a recombinant cell or it may be prepared by chemical synthesis by methods<br>
known in the art. As described in the above, such chimeric proteins and / or peptides<br>
may be coupled to carriers to increase the immunologic response to the proteins /<br>
peptides and may be administered with or without an adjuvant and/or excipient.<br>
Adjuvant<br>
Adjuvants may be included in the vaccine composition to enhance the specific<br>
immune response. Thus, it is particular important to identify an adjuvant that when<br>
combined with the antigen(s) / nucleic acid constructs and / or delivery vehicles such<br>
as adenoviral vehicles (any of which may also be referred to as immunogenic<br>
determinant), results in a vaccine composition capable of inducing a strong specific<br>
immunological response. The immunogenic determinant may also be mixed with two<br>
or more different adjuvants prior to immunisation. Vaccine compositions are also<br>
referred to as immunogenic compositions in the present text.<br>
A large number of adjuvants have been described and used for the generation of<br>
antibodies in laboratory animals, such as mouse, rats and rabbits. In such setting<br>
the tolerance of side effect is rather high as the main aim is to obtain a strong<br>
antibody response. For use and for approval for use in pharmaceuticals, and<br>
especially for use in humans it is required that the components of the vaccine<br>
composition, including the adjuvant, are well characterized. It is further required that<br>
the composition has minimal risk of any adverse reaction, such as granuloma,<br>
abscesses or fever.<br>
An embodiment of the present invention relates to a vaccine comprising an<br>
adjuvant. In a preferred embodiment the vaccine composition is suitable for<br>
administration to a mammal, and most preferably to a human subject. Therefore the<br>
preferred adjuvant is suitable for administration to a mammal and most preferably is<br>
suitable for administration to a human subject.<br>
The choice of adjuvant may further be selected by its ability to stimulate the type of<br>
immune response desired, B-cell or/and T-cell activation and the vaccine<br>
composition may be formulated to optimize distribution and presentation to the<br>
relevant lymphatic tissues.<br>
Adjuvants pertaining to the present invention may be grouped according to their<br>
origin, be it mineral, bacterial, plant, synthetic, or host product. The first group under<br>
this classification is the mineral adjuvants, such as aluminum compounds. Antigens<br>
precipitated with aluminum salts or antigens mixed with or adsorbed to performed<br>
aluminum compounds have been used extensively to augment immune responses<br>
in animals and humans. Aluminium particles have been demonstrated in regional<br>
lymph nodes of rabbits seven days following immunization, and it may be that<br>
another significant function is to direct antigen to T cell containing areas in the<br>
nodes themselves. Adjuvant potency has been shown to correlate with intimation of<br>
the draining lymph nodes. While many studies have confirmed that antigens<br>
administered with aluminium salts lead to increased humoral immunity, ceil<br>
mediated immunity appears to be only slightly increased, as measured by delayed-<br>
type hypersensitivity. Aluminium hydroxide has also been described as activating<br>
the complement pathway. This mechanism may play a role in the local inflammatory<br>
response as well as immunoglobulin production and B cell memory. Furthermore,<br>
aluminum hydroxide can protect the antigen from rapid catabolism. Primarily<br>
because of their excellent record of safety, aluminum compounds are presently the<br>
only adjuvants used in humans.<br>
Another large group of adjuvants is those of bacterial origin. Adjuvants with bacterial<br>
origins can be purified and synthesized (e.g. muramyl dipeptides, lipid A) and host<br>
mediators have been cloned (Interleukin 1 and 2). The last decade has brought<br>
significant progress in the chemical purification of several adjuvants of active<br>
components of bacterial origin: Bordetella pertussis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis,<br>
lipopoly-saccharide, Freund's Complete Adjuvant (FCA) and Freund's Incomplete<br>
Adjuvant (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, Mich.) and Merck Adjuvant 65 (Merck and<br>
Company, Inc., Rahway, N.J.). Additionally suitable adjuvants in accordance with<br>
the present invention are e.g. Titermax Classical adjuvant (SIGMA-ALDRICH),<br>
ISCOMS, Quil A, ALUN, see US 58767 and 5,554,372, Lipid A derivatives,<br>
choleratoxin derivatives, HSP derivatives, LPS derivatives, synthetic peptide<br>
matrixes, GMDP, and other as well as combined with immunostimulants (US<br>
5,876,735). B. pertussis is of interest as an adjuvant in the context of the present<br>
invention due to its ability to modulate cell-mediated immunity through action on T-<br>
lymphocyte populations. For lipopolysaccharide and Freund's Complete Adjuvant,<br>
adjuvant active moieties have been identified and synthesized which permit study of<br>
structure-function relationships. These are also considered for inclusion in<br>
immunogenic compositions according to the present invention.<br>
Lipopolysaccharide and its various derivatives, including lipid A, have been found to<br>
be powerful adjuvants in combination with liposomes or other lipid emulsions. It is<br>
not yet certain whether derivatives with sufficiently low toxicity for general use in<br>
humans can be produced. Freund's Complete Adjuvant is the standard in most<br>
experimental studies.<br>
Mineral oil may be added to the immunogenic composition in order to protect the<br>
antigen from rapid catabolism.<br>
Many other types of materials can be used as adjuvants in immunogenic<br>
compositions according to the present invention. They include plant products such<br>
as saponin, animal products such as chitin and numerous synthetic chemicals.<br>
Adjuvants according to the present invention can also been categorized by their<br>
proposed mechanisms of action. This type of classification is necessarily somewhat<br>
arbitrary because most adjuvants appear to function by more than one mechanism.<br>
Adjuvants may act through antigen localization and delivery, or by direct effects on<br>
cells making up the immune system, such as macrophages and lymphocytes.<br>
Another mechanism by which adjuvants according to the invention enhance the<br>
immune response is by creation of an antigen depot. This appears to contribute to<br>
the adjuvant activity of aluminum compounds, oil emulsions, liposomes, and<br>
synthetic polymers. The adjuvant activity of lipopolysaccharides and muramyl<br>
dipeptides appears to be mainly mediated through activation of the macrophage,<br>
whereas B. pertussis affects both macrophages and lymphocytes. Further examples<br>
of adjuvants that may be useful when incorporated into immunogenic compositions<br>
according to the present invention are described in US 5,554,372.<br>
Adjuvants useful in both prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines according to the<br>
present invention may thus be mineral salts, such as aluminium hydroxide and<br>
aluminium or calcium phosphates gels, oil emulsions and surfactant based<br>
formulations such as MF59 (microfluidized detergent stabilized oil in water<br>
emulsion), QS21 (purified saponin), AS02 (SBAS2, oil-in-water emulsion +<br>
monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) + QS21), Montanide ISA 51 and ISA-720 (stabilized<br>
water in oil emulsion), Adjuvant 65 (containing peanut oil, mannide monooleate and<br>
aluminum monostearate), RIBI ImmunoChem Research Inc., Hamilton, Utah),<br>
particulate adjuvants, such as virosomes (unilamellar liposomal cehicles<br>
incorporating influenza haemagglutinin), AS04 (Al salt with MPL), ISCOMS<br>
(structured complex of saponins and lipids (such as cholesterol), polyactide co-<br>
glycolide (PLG), microbial derivatives (natural and synthetic) such as<br>
monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL), Detox (MPL + M. Phlei cell wall skeleton), AGP (RC-<br>
529 (synthetic acylated monosaccharide)), DC_chol (lipoidal immunostimulators<br>
able to self organise into liposomes), OM-174 (lipid A derivative), CpG motifs<br>
(synthetic oligonucleotides containing immunostimulatory CpG motifs), modified<br>
bacterial toxins, LT and CT, with non-toxic adjuvant effects, Endogenous human<br>
immunomodulators, e.g., hGM-CSF or hlL-12 or Immudaptin (C3d tandem array),<br>
inert vehicles such as gold particles.<br>
Additional examples of adjuvants comprise: Immunostimulatory oil emulsions (for<br>
example, water-in-oil, oil-in-water, water-in-oil-in-water such as e.g. Freund's<br>
incomplete adjuvant such as Montainde®, Specol, mineral salts such e.g. as<br>
AI(OH)3, AIPO4, microbial products, Saponins such as Qual A, synthetic products, as<br>
well as adjuvant formulations, and immune stimulatory complexes (ISCOMs) and<br>
cytokines, heat-inactivated bacteria/components, nanobeads, LPS, LTA. A list of<br>
other commonly used adjuvants is disclosed on pages 6-8 in WO 03089471, the list<br>
being hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
Immunogenic compositions according to the invention may also contain diluents<br>
 such as buffers, antioxidants such as ascorbic acid, low molecular weight (less than<br>
about 10 residues) polypeptides, proteins, amino acids, carbohydrates including<br>
glucose, sucrose or dextrins, chelating agents such as EDTA, glutathione and other<br>
stabilizers and excipients. Neutral buffered saline or saline mixed with non-specific<br>
serum albumin are exemplary appropriate diluents.<br>
Adjuvants are generally included in the immunogenic compositions in an amount<br>
according to the instructions of the manufacturer.<br>
Administration<br>
Vaccine compositions according to the invention may be administered to an<br>
individual in therapeutically effective amounts. The effective amount may vary<br>
according to a variety of factors such as the individual's condition, weight, sex and<br>
age. Other factors include the mode of administration.<br>
The pharmaceutical or veterinary compositions may be provided to the individual by<br>
a variety of routes such as subcutaneous, topical, oral and intramuscular.<br>
Administration of pharmaceutical compositions is accomplished orally or<br>
parenterally. Methods of parenteral delivery include topical, intra-arterial (directly to<br>
the tissue), intramuscular, subcutaneous, intramedullary, intrathecal, intraventricular,<br>
intravenous, intraperitoneal, or intranasal administration. The present invention also<br>
has the objective of providing suitable topical, oral, systemic and parenteral<br>
pharmaceutical formulations for use in the methods of prophylaxis and treatment<br>
with the vaccine composition.<br>
For example, the vaccine compositions can be administered in such oral dosage<br>
forms as tablets, capsules (each including timed release and sustained release<br>
formulations), pills, powders, granules, elixirs, tinctures, solutions, suspensions,<br>
syrups and emulsions, or by injection. Likewise, they may also be administered in<br>
intravenous (both bolus and infusion), intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, topical with or<br>
without occlusion, or intramuscular form, all using forms well known to those of<br>
ordinary skill in the pharmaceutical arts. An effective but non-toxic amount of the<br>
vaccine, comprising any of the herein described compounds can be employed as a<br>
prophylactic or therapeutic agent. Also any and all conventional dosage forms that<br>
are known in the art to be appropriate for formulating injectable immunogenic<br>
peptide composition are encompassed, such as lyophilized forms and solutions,<br>
suspensions or emulsion forms containing, if required, conventional<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents, preservatives, adjuvants, buffer<br>
components, etc.<br>
Preferred modes of administration of the vaccine composition according to the<br>
invention include, but are not limited to systemic administration, such as intravenous<br>
or subcutaneous administration, intradermal administration, intramuscular<br>
administration, intranasal administration, oral administration, rectal administration,<br>
vaginal administration, pulmonary administration and generally any form of mucosal<br>
administration. Furthermore, it is within the scope of the present invention that the<br>
means for any of the administration forms mentioned in the herein are included in<br>
the present invention.<br>
A vaccine according to the present invention can be administered once, or any<br>
number of times such as two, three, four or five times. Administering the vaccine<br>
more than once has the effect of boosting the resulting immune response. The<br>
vaccine can further be boosted by administering the vaccine in a form or body part<br>
different from the previous administration. The booster shot is either a homologous<br>
or a heterologous booster shot. A homologous booster shot is a where the first and<br>
subsequent vaccinations comprise the same constructs and more specifically the<br>
same delivery vehicle especially the same viral vector. A heterologous booster shot<br>
is where identical constructs are comprised within different viral vectors. This is<br>
especially of interest when employing adenoviral delivery as the human body raises<br>
an immune response against a given adenovirus if it has previously been exposed<br>
thereto. A preferred embodiment of the present invention therefore relates to the<br>
pegylation of the adenoviral vector providing the option of boosting with the same<br>
(homologous) adenoviral vector. An alternative and preferred embodiment relates to<br>
the sequential boosting of a vaccine with different adenoviral vectors comprising the<br>
same constructs.<br>
A preferred administration form of the vaccine according to the present invention is<br>
administering the vaccine to the body area, inside or out, most likely to be the<br>
receptacle of a given infection. The receptacle of infection is the body area that the<br>
infection is received by, e.g. regarding influenza, the receptacle of infection is the<br>
lungs.<br>
The vaccine of the present invention can be administered to any organism to which<br>
it may be beneficial, especially any animal such as a vertebrate animal. It falls within<br>
the scope of the present invention that the means and modes of administration of<br>
the vaccine are adapted to the recipient. A preferred recipient of the vaccine is a<br>
mammal and the mammal is in a more preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention selected from the group of: cows, pigs, horses, sheep, goats, llamas, mice,<br>
rats, monkeys, dogs, cats and humans. In the most preferred embodiment the<br>
mammal is a human.<br>
An embodiment of the present invention includes a vaccine composition further<br>
comprising a second active ingredient. The second active ingredient is selected<br>
from, but not limited the group of antibiotics, chemotherapeutics, anti-allergenics,<br>
cytokines, complement factors and co-stimulatory molecules of the immurie system.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention comprises a kit of parts, wherein the<br>
kit includes at least one vaccine composition according to any of the above, a<br>
means for administering said vaccine and the instruction on how to do so. It is within<br>
the scope of the present invention to include multiple dosages of the same vaccine<br>
or several different vaccines. In a preferred embodiment the kit of parts further<br>
comprises a second active ingredient.<br>
The present invention further comprises a method for inducing an immune response<br>
in an animal, comprising administering to the animal a vaccine according to any of<br>
the above. The immune response is, but is not limited to any of the following types<br>
of responses: an MHC-I dependent response, an MHC-I and/ or MHC-II dependent<br>
response, a T-cell dependent response, a CD4 T-cell dependent response, a CD4+<br>
T cell independent response, a CD8+ T-cell dependent response and a B cell<br>
dependent immune response. Another method falling within the scope of the present<br>
invention is the method of providing at least one vaccine according to any of the<br>
above and administering said at least one vaccine to a subject at least once for<br>
treatment or prophylaxis of an animal. The invention also encompasses the nucleic<br>
acid construct according the herein described for the preparation of a composition<br>
for the production of a vaccine. Said vaccine can be but is not limited being used for<br>
genetic immunization of an animal, or to treat a clinical condition in an individual in<br>
need thereof.<br>

108 B16.F10 melanoma cells expressing the LCMV derived GP33 epitope. Initially a<br>
tumor was formed in all animals, but the majority of Ad-li-GP and LCMV primed<br>
mice eventually rejected the tumor. Each group consisted of 7-10 animals.<br>

Examples<br>
The invention will now be further illustrated with reference to the following examples.<br>
It will be appreciated that what follows is by way of example only and that<br>
modifications in detail may be made while still falling within the scope of the<br>
invention.<br><br>
Example 1:<br>
CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell responses to adenovirus encoded epitopes.<br>
Mice: C57BL/6 (H-2b), C57BL/6 x BALB/c (H-2bxd) F1 hybrids and MHC ll-/- mice<br>
(B6.129-H2-Ab1tm1GlmN12 (H-2b)) were obtained from Taconic M&amp;B (Ry, Denmark).<br>
All mice used were between 7-10 weeks old and housed in a specific germ free<br>
facility. All experimental procedures were performed according to local experimental<br>
guidelines.<br>
Adenovirus vectors: For construction of E1 and E3 deleted adenovirus-expressing,<br>
LCMV derived antigen fused to invariant chain we performed 2-step PCR. First we<br>
obtained overlapping PCR products containing the full-length mouse invariant chain<br>
and full-length LCMV glycoprotein and these were joined by secondary PCR with<br>
invariant chain 5' and glycoprotein 3' primers. Adenovirus expressing full-length GP<br>
was amplified in single step PCR. The obtained fragments were cloned into the<br>
pacCMV shuttle vector. The obtained plasmid was co-transfected with pJM17<br>
plasmid into HEK293 cells and viral lysates were obtained. These were cloned by<br>
plaque purification before sequencing, large-scale production and purification by<br>
CsCI gradient centrifugation as described (Becker et al., 1994, Methods Cell Biol. 43<br>
R A:161-189). Infectivity of adenovirus stocks was determined with the Adeno-X<br>
Rapid Titer Kit (Clontech). All unmodified virus stocks had particle/IFU ratios<br>
between 46 and 201.<br>
Vaccinations: in all studies, mice to be vaccinated were anaesthetized and injected<br>
with 2x107 infectious units in the right hind footpad in a volume of 0.03 mi.<br>
Virus infection: Mice were infected i.e. with 20 pfu of LCMV Armstrong clone 53b in<br>
a volume of 0.03 ml or i.v. with 108 pfu of LCMV clone 13 in 0.3 ml. I.e. infection<br>
induces a fatal CD8+ T cell-mediated meningitis from which immunocompetent mice<br>
succumb on days 7 to 10 p.i. (post infection) (Christensen et al., Scandinavian<br>
Journal of Immunology 40:373-382).<br>
Survival study: Mortality was used to evaluate the clinical severity of acute LCMV-<br>
induced meningitis. Mice were checked twice daily for a minimum of 2 weeks after<br>
i.e. inoculation; deaths occurring less than 3 days after infection were excluded from<br>
analysis.<br>
Organ virus titers: To determine virus titers in organs, these were first homogenized<br>
in PBS to yield 10% (v/w) organ suspensions, and serial 10-fold dilutions were<br>
prepared. Each dilution was then plated in duplicates on MC57G cells. Forty-eight<br>
hours after infection, infected cell clusters were detected using monoclonal rat anti-<br>
LCMV (VL-4) antibody, peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rat antibody and o-<br>
phenylendiamin (substrate) (Battegay et al., 1991, Journal of Virological Methods<br>
33:191-198). The numbers of pfu were counted, and results expressed as pfu/g<br>
tissue.<br>
Cell preparations: Single cell suspensions of spleen cells were obtained by pressing<br>
the organs through a fine steel mesh.<br>
Abs for flow cytometric: The following monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were<br>
purchased from BD PharMingen (San Diego, CA) as rat anti-mouse antibody: Cy-<br>
chrome-conjugated anti-CD8, FITC-conjugated anti-CD44, phycoerythrin (PE)-<br>
corijugated anti-IFN-v and PE-conjugated lgd isotype standard.<br>
Flow cytometri analysis: Staining of cells for flow cytometry was performed<br>
according to standard laboratory procedure (Andersson et al., 1994, Journal of<br>
Immunology 152:1237-1245; Andreasen et al., 1999, International Immunology<br>
11:1463-1473). For enumeration of LCMV-SRecific CD8+ T cells, splenocytes were<br>
incubated in vitro for 5 h at 37 °C In 5% C02 with relevant peptide (0.1 µg/ml) in the<br>
presence of monensin (3 µM, Sigma Chemicals co., St. Louis, MO) and murine<br>
recombinant IL-2 (10 units/well, R&amp;D Systems Europe Ltd, Abingdon, UK). After<br>
incubation cells were surface stained, washed, fixed and permeabilized using 0.5%<br>
saponin. Cells were then stained with anti-IFN-yor IgG1 isotype control for20 min at<br>
4 °C. Samples were analyzed using a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur, and at least<br>
104 mononuclear cells were gated using a combination of low angle and side scatter<br>
to exclude dead cells and debris. Data analysis was conducted using Cell Quest Pro<br>
(B&amp;D Biosciences).<br>
Replication deficient adenovirus vectors expressing lymphocytic choriomeningitis<br>
virus full-length glycoprotein (Ad-GP), or lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus full-<br>
length glycoprotein N-terminally linked to murine invariant chain ((Ad-liGP) for<br>
schematic representation of the expression cassette see figure 1), were generated<br>
through standard methods (Becker et al., Methods Cell Biol. 43 Pt A:161-189).<br>
C57BL/6 mice were then vaccinated in the right hind paw with 2x107 infectious units<br>
of Ad-GP or Ad-liGP and mice were sacrificed 5, 7,11,14, 21, 28, 90,180 or 360<br>
days later. The generation of LCMV glycoprotein specific T-cells were then analysed<br>
on splenic cells. Evidently (see figure 2), at all time points tested, Ad-liGP induced<br>
numerically superior T-cell responses compared to Ad-GP, and these were<br>
accelerated and included both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses. Thus peak<br>
numbers of T-cells generated after Ad-liGP vaccination were obtained at 7-14 days<br>
after vaccination depending on the epitope, with responses after Ad-GP peaking at<br>
day 21 after vaccination.<br>
Example 2:<br>
CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell responses to adenovirus encoded epitopes in F1 hybrid mice:<br>
As C57BL/6 mice are homozygous with regard to both MHC class I and MHC class<br>
II molecules on all loci, we tested whether Ad-GP and Ad-liGP could also induce an<br>
immune response in C57BL/6 x BALB/c F1 mice that express both the H-2b and H2d<br>
haplotypes. These mice resemble an out bred population, but with defined<br>
haplotypes. The experiments were performed as above, but testing was limited to<br>
day 21 after vaccination. As can be seen from figure 3, Ad-liGP efficiently induces<br>
CD8+ T-ceil responses towards a multitude of epitopes while Ad-GP seemed to<br>
perform worse than in homozygous C57BL/6 mice.<br>
Example 3:<br>
Ad-liGP exerts CD8+ T-cell stimulatory effects that are independent of CD4+ T-cells:<br>
As a potential mechanism of li function in the enhanced stimulation of CD8+ T-cells<br>
is the ability to traffic to endosomal and lysosomal compartments and stimulate<br>
CD4+ T-cells (Diebold et al., 2001, Gene Ther. 8:487-493) through MHC class II, we<br>
performed vaccination of MHC class II deficient mice. To this effect MHC-II-/-or<br>
C57BL/6 mice were vaccinated with 2x107 IFU of Ad-GP or Ad-liGP in the right hind<br>
footpad. On day 21 or 90 post vaccination the number of epitope specific CD8+ or<br>
CD4+ T cells were determined by intracellular staining for peptide-induced IFN-v of<br>
spleen cells. As can be seen from figure 4, Ad-liGP efficiently induces CD8+ T-cell<br>
responses directed against several epitopes; in the absence of CD4+ T cell help<br>
however, some responses were lower than what is seen in wild type mice.<br>
Example 4:<br>
Ad-liGP confers rapid, superior and sustained protection against lethal LCMV<br>
infection: As we observed an accelerated response to Ad-liGP compared to Ad-GP<br>
we investigated the ability of vaccination to confer protection both at 21 days post<br>
vaccination (peak of Ad-GP) and at 3, 5, 7, 14, 60, 90, 180 and 360 days post<br>
vaccination (Figure 5). Remarkably, we found that Ad-liGP vaccinated animals<br>
vaccinated as little as 3 days previously were protected against intracerebral LCMV<br>
infection. Protection conferred by Ad-GP was only partial at 14 and 21 days post<br>
infection and no protection were seen at day 60 or later. Furthermore, the Ad-liGP<br>
conferred protection was sustained for 360 days, at which point Ad-GP no longer<br>
protected against intracerebral LCMV infection.<br>
Example 5:<br>
Ad-liGP efficiently protects against high-dose, intravenous LCMV infection: Since we<br>
found that Ad-liGP protected mice against an acute localised infection, we wanted to<br>
investigate whether the same held true for a high-dose systemic infection.<br>
Accordingly, mice were vaccinated with Ad-GP, Ad-liGP or sham (PBS), and<br>
challenged 21 days later by intravenous injection of 106 plaque-forming units of the<br>
fast replicating LCMV clone 13 strain. 5 days later animals were sacrificed and<br>
infectious titers in the lungs were determined. Although Ad-GP conferred significant<br>
protection upon vaccinated animals, Ad-liGP was superior and reduced titers to a<br>
level at or below the detection limit of the assay (Figure 6).<br>

e.g. as described in Examples 1, 2 and 3, long-term immunity e.g. as described in<br>
Examples 1,4 and 5, and virus dose needed for immunity.<br>

All of these constructs are furthermore used as the starting point for a series of<br>
constructs in which the GP-fusions are followed by an internal ribosomal entry site<br>
(IRES) and a gene encoding VP22, HIV tat or Cx43.<br>

3.	N-terminally to connexin 43 (Cx43)<br>

or other connexins and intercellular gap-junctions constituents.<br>
All of the above constructs are furthermore altered in any of the following ways:<br>
1.   All of the above constructs followed by an IRES site and a gene encoding an<br>
NK-cell (natural killer cell) activation molecule, for example H60. This<br><br>
alteration gives enhanced delivery of co-stimulatory signals and cytokine<br>
help.<br>

NP, LCMV GP, Ebola GP Ebola NP, murine gammaherpesvirus (MHV-68)<br>
M2, M3 (this corresponds to the human EBV and HHV8 viruses) and ORF73,<br>
chicken Ovalbumin (OVA), or a helper T-cell epitope. These antigenic<br>
sequences will furthermore be combined so at least 2 or more are encoded<br>
in the same vector.<br>
See figure 14 for an example of a comparison of the efficiency of Ad-li-GP pg33 and<br>
gp276 constructs compared to Ad-GP-Lamp-1 pg33 and gp276 constructs as<br>
measured by CD8+ T-cell responses. As can be seen, the Ad-li-GP constructs are<br>
superior to the Ad-GP-Lamp-1 constructs in their capability of evoking a CD8+ T-cell<br>
response.<br>

needed for immunity.<br>
All constructs described in Example 6 are comparatively analysed among each<br>
other and to Ad-GP and Ad-liGP following alternative administration methods. The<br>
comparisons are done with respect to the kinetics and magnitude of immune<br>
response e.g. as described in Examples 1, 2 and 3, long-term immunity e.g. as<br>
described in Examples 1, 4 and 5, and virus dose needed for immunity.<br>
Alternative administration methods include:<br>
1.	Alterations with regard to enhanced delivery of co-stimulatory signals and<br>
cytokine help in which all of the in Example 6 described constructs are co-<br>
injected with adenovirus encoded type 1 interferon, for example tetracycline<br>
inducible IFN-ß. Furthermore, all the in Example 6 described constructs are<br>
co-injected with adenovirus encoded cytokine, for example IL-15.<br>
2.	Administration of Ad-liGP simultaneously with Ad-Tet-onGP at separate sites<br>
of the body (Ad-Tet-onGP encodes GP under control of a tetracycline<br>
inducible promoter).<br>
3.	Adenovirally delivery of any one of the in Example 6 described<br>
inserts/constructs followed by homologous viral vector boosting with the<br>
same insert/construct or followed by heterologous viral vector boosting with<br>
lentivirus encoded or other adenovirus-encoded delivery of the same<br>
insert/construct.<br>
Example 8:<br>
Ad-liGP confers rapid and superior protection against lethal LCMV infection in<br>
absence of major epitopes. Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus full-length<br>
glycoprotein (GP) comprises four CD8+ specific epitopes of varying antigenicity,<br>
measured by the percentile of CD8+ cells with specificity for the individual epitope<br>
against all the CD8+ cells raised in response to GP vaccination. The predominant<br>
population of CD8+ cells raised against GP is specific for the gp33 epitope, a<br>
somewhat smaller population is specific for gp276, and minor populations are<br>
specific for gp118 and for gp92. As gp33 and gp276 are the major / immuno-<br>
dominant epitopes, we investigated how nil mutations of either epitope<br>
independently or both simultaneously would effect the efficiency of the protection<br>
offered by the Ad-liGP fusion construct.<br>
C57BL/6 mice were vaccinated with 2x107 IFU Ad-GP and Ad-liGP or sham infected<br>
in the right hind footpad. Each group consisted of 5 animals. On day 90 post<br>
vaccination, the animals were challenged with 20 pfu LCMV Arm 53b i.e. (intra<br>
cerebral) constructs carrying gp33 nil mutations, gp276 nil mutations or gp33/gp276<br>
double nil mutations. Mortality was recorded for 14 days. As can be seen from figure<br>
7, Ad-liGP conferred superior protection against lethal LCMV infection despite the<br>
gp33 or gp276 nil mutations. The double nil mutation of gp33/gp276 lead to the<br>
survival of 70% of the animals compared to no surviving animals in the Ad-GP and<br>
Sham vaccinated groups.<br>
Surviving animals from the experiment above were analyzed for epitope specific<br>
CD8+ or CD4+T cells by intracellular staining for peptide-induced IFN-y of spleen<br>
cells. Expectedly, as can be seen from figure 8, in the absence of either gp33 or<br>
gp276, the major epitope specificity of the CD8+ or CD4+T cells is gp276 or gp33,<br>
respectively. In the absence of both gp33/gp276, the major epitope specificity of the<br>
CD8+ or CD4+T cells is gp92.<br>
Example 9:<br>
CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses to vaccination with naked DNA-liGP and DNA-GP.<br>
To investigate an alternative platform for invariant chain fusion vaccines other than<br>
adenoviral delivery, we tested the ability of liGP and GP as naked DNA to raise GP-<br>
epitope specific CD8* and CD4+ T cells. The naked DNA comprised the GP and li-<br>
GP fragments from the Adenoviral vectors illustrated in figure 1.<br>
C57BU6 mice were vaccinated with DNA coated onto 1.6-nm gold particles in a<br>
concentration of 2 µg DNA/mg gold, and the DNA-gold complex was coated onto<br>
plastic tubes such that 0.5 mg gold (1 ug DNA per shot) was delivered to the mouse<br>
per shot. Mice were immunized at the abdominal skin using a hand-held gene gun<br>
device employing compressed helium (400 psi) as the particle motive force. Mice<br>
were inoculated four times with an interval of 1 week and then allowed to rest for 1<br>
week before investigation. The number of epitope specific CD8+ or CD4+ T cells<br>
were determined by intracellular staining for peptide-induced IFN-y of spleen cells.<br>
As can be seen from figure 9, DNA-liGP efficiently induces CD8+ T-cell responses<br>
directed against several epitopes.<br>
Example 10:<br>
Ad-liGP confers superior protection against challenge with tumor cells expressing<br>
the gp33 epitope from LCMV. Under normal circumstances, tumor cells express<br>
several different antigens recognized by T cells. To determine the efficiency of this<br>
response, B16.F10 melanoma cells expressing gp33 from LCMV were used to<br>
challenge vaccinated animals with.<br>
C57BL/6 mice were vaccinated with 2x107 IFU Ad-GP or Ad-liGP in the right hind<br>
footpad. As a control some animals were vaccinated with Ad-ß-galactosidase<br>
(negative control) or infected with LCMV (positive control). On day 90 after<br>
vaccination/infection animals were challenged with 106 tumor cells subcutaneously<br>
and the tumor growth was followed by measuring the size of the tumor. Initially a<br>
tumor will form in all animals, but eventually the immune response directed towards<br>
gp33 will eliminate the tumor cells. Each group consisted of 7-10 animals.<br>
Prophylactic vaccination with Ad-li-GP resulted in tumor free mice in 70% of the<br>
cases compared to only 10% in Ad-GP vaccinated animals, as can be seen from<br>
figure 10.<br>
In many cases the tumor has already formed when a physician sees the patient. To<br>
mimic this situation, C57BL/6 mice were injected with 106 B16.F10 tumor cells<br>
subcutaneously. After 5 days the tumors were palpably recognizable and could be<br>
measured. At this time point animals were vaccinated with 2x107 IFU Ad-GP or Ad-<br>
liGP in the right hind footpad. As a control some animals were vaccinated with Ad-£$-<br>
galactosidase (negative control) or infected with LCMV (positive control). Tumor<br>
growth was followed by measuring the size of the tumor, and once the size was<br>
greater that 12 mm in any dimension the animals were sacrificed. As can be seen<br>
from figure 11, in mice given the therapeutic Ad-iiGP vaccine, the speed of tumor<br>
development was approximately half of that seen in mice given Ad-GP as<br>
therapeutic vaccine, as measured by number of days passing prior to reaching a 12<br>
mm tumor size and animal sacrifice.<br>
Example 11:<br>
To demonstrate that the vaccine construct also can induce protecting antibody<br>
response the VSV infection was used.<br>
Virus and virus quantitation: Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) of the Indiana serotype<br>
was used throughout this study. Stocks of virus were propagated in L929 cells<br>
(ATCC CCL 1) and stored at -70 °C until use. Virus quantitation was performed by<br>
plaque assay on monolayers of L929 cells. In brief, serial 10-fold dilutions of virus<br>
were prepared in Eagle's minimal essential medium (F11) containing 1% L-<br>
glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 5% NaHC03 and 10% fetal calf serum. One<br>
ml of each dilution was added in duplicate to monolayers of L929 cells in petri<br>
dishes plated 48 hours earlier. After incubation for 90 min at 37°C in 5% C02,<br>
medium containing the virus dilutions was aspirated, and the monolayers were<br>
overlaid with a mixture of 2.5 ml 1% agarose and 2.5 ml 2 x F11. Monolayers were<br>
then incubated for 24 hours at 37°C in 5% CQ2 before staining with a mixture of 1 ml<br>
of 1% agarose and 1 ml of 2 x F11 containing 1% neutralred. After further 24 hours<br>
of incubation, the numbers of PFU were counted.<br>
Survival study. Mortality was used as parameter for the severity of VSV infection,<br>
based on previous findings that virus titer in CNS correlate strongly with clinical<br>
symptoms (Thomsen et al. 1997, Int. Immunol. 9:1757-1766.). Mice were inspected<br>
daily for signs of VSV-induced paralysis, and sacrificed when severe paralysis was<br>
noted and the animals expected to succumb within the next 24 hours.<br>
Serum neutralizations test: Serial two-fold dilutions of serum in F11 were mixed with<br>
equal volumes of virus diluted to contain approximately 100 PFU/ml. After 1 h of<br>
incubation at room temperature, 1 ml of each serum-virus mixture was added in<br>
duplicate to monolayers of L929 cells in petri dishes and assayed for the presence<br>
of residual virus by plaque assay (see virus and virus quantitation). The highest<br>
serum dilution that reduced the number of plaques by at least 50% was taken as the<br>
neutralizing titer.<br>
C57BL/6 mice were vaccinated in the right hind foot-pad with 2 x 107 IFU of<br>
adenovirus encoding either full-length glycoprotein of vesicular stomatitis virus (Ad-<br>
VSVGP) or glycoprotein linked to invariant chain (Ad-li-VSVGP). On day 7, 14, 21<br>
and 110 after vaccination serum samples were collected and in vitro neutralizing<br>
antibody titers were determined in a plaque-reduction assay, figure 12a. On day 3,<br>
7, 14, 21 and 110 after vaccination, animals were challenged with 105 PFU of VSV<br>
intranasaily, and mortality was registered over the next 14 days, figure 12b. As seen<br>
in figure 12 almost identical responses are seen in the two groups, suggesting that,<br>
although not an advantage, the invariant chain allows for antibody production and<br>
does not have a detrimental effect on the production.<br>
