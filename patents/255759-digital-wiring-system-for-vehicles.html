DIGITAL WIRING SYSTEM FOR VEHICLES<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
As stated in the title of this specification, this invention relates to a digital<br>
wiring system for vehicles with the aim of simplifying that wiring, such that the<br>
number of wires used and the assembly time required is reduced.<br>
The invention is applicable in any automotive vehicle, such as cars,<br>
trucks, trains, aircraft, etc.<br>
PRIOR ART OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the automobile market, the demands in equipping for comfort,<br>
information, supervision, safety, control, etc. have generated an increase in<br>
integrated systems in turn compelling an expansion in the electrical wiring<br>
supplying the energy and control to the different pieces of equipment.<br>
Each different piece of equipment generates a variety of ranges within a<br>
single model forcing the manufacture to provide different types of wiring, or to<br>
keep the same wiring for all the models of the range and not to use part of it<br>
since some models in the range do not include all the utilities.<br>
As a result, the wiring of vehicles is becoming ever more complicated<br>
and leading to an increase in manufacturing costs.<br>
Forming part of the prior art related to this invention is document EP-<br>
1264738 describing and illustrating the cable collector system made up of node<br>
connectors which include multiplex communication controllers. The multiplex<br>
communication controllers of the node connectors have a sample reception<br>
controller for receiving the sample via a set of timing bits which is set during<br>
each defined period of time. Only one specific node connector has a controller<br>
that includes a CPU and the multiplex communication controllers allow the<br>
node communication controllers to make common use of data that is stored in<br>
this controller.<br>
Also forming part of the prior art related to this invention is document<br>
WO-9736400 describing and illustrating a device for transferring data during<br>
certain time spaces within a framework of time multiplexed networks, which<br>
comprises a master node and a slave node, wherein the allocation of time<br>
spaces so that the slave node can receive data from or transmit data to a third<br>
node is controlled by said master node.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In order to simplify the wiring of vehicles and cut costs, the invention has<br><br><br>
developed a new wiring system characterised in that it comprises a<br>
synchronisation generator which generates a clock signal consisting of pulse<br>
trains separated by rest periods which, by means of a synchronisation line, it<br>
sends to at least one multiplexer module, which is in turn selectively connected<br>
to at least one reception input for data coming from electroelectronic devices of<br>
the vehicle and/or to a transmission output for data to the electroelectronic<br>
devices to govern; the multiplexer module also having means of storing an<br>
identification code, means of detection of the pulses generated in order to<br>
generate codes on the basis of these pulses, and a detection decoder which,<br>
when the generated code corresponds to that of the multiplexer module, its<br>
activation takes place and permits transmission/reception of data for governing<br>
the electroelectronic devices.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, a plurality of multiplexers has been<br>
provided, which receive the pulse trains and which are connected together and<br>
to the synchronisation generator via a data line, in order to permit exchange of<br>
input and/or output data among the different multiplexers and thereby govern<br>
the electroelectronic devices connected to different multiplexer modules.<br>
This configuration allows the multiplexer modules to transmit various sets<br>
of information or data down the data line sequentially without losing any<br>
identity, awarding an occupancy time of the line for each datum belonging to<br>
each multiplexer module on the basis of the detected identification code.<br>
The detection means of the generated pulse consist of a counter for<br>
those generated pulses in order to generate the different codes. The means of<br>
storage of at least one identification code comprise a microswitch for selection<br>
of that code; and the decoder comprises a comparator which receives the count<br>
from the pulses and the code set up via the microswitch, in such a way that<br>
when it detects that the count made corresponds to the identification code it<br>
activates the multiplexer module.<br>
The management time of an input and/or output of a multiplexer module<br>
corresponds to a cycle or period of the pulse train. As a result, the counters are<br>
provided with means for maintaining the activation of the module during a<br>
certain number of cycles corresponding to the number of inputs and/or outputs<br>
of the multiplexer module.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the multiplexer module is planned to<br>
manage an input or output during one cycle of the pulse train.<br><br><br>
In another embodiment of the invention it has been planned for the<br>
multiplexer module to manage an input or output with each half cycle of the<br>
pulse train in order to process two input/output data with each cycle.<br>
In order for the system to function correctly, the multiplexer modules are<br>
provided with means for detecting the rest periods, the detection of which<br>
generates the setting of the counter to zero, with each multiplexer module being<br>
able to be selected in different periods of time.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the means for detecting the rest<br>
periods comprise a monostable which is kept in the stable state during the<br>
pulse trains and switches when no pulse train is detected.<br>
The invention provides that the feed for the multiplexers can be done<br>
directly starting from the pulse trains, in such a way that the synchronisation<br>
line also constitutes that for the feed. Also, the multiplexers are fitted with the<br>
corresponding direct current feed input coming directly from the battery so that<br>
they can be fed by the battery when necessary.<br>
The embodiment of using the synchronisation line as a feed line is<br>
advantageous since it saves on a wire and a connection for each multiplexer<br>
module as well as making it independent of the power supply coming from the<br>
vehicle battery, and it furthermore permits the system to be made compatible<br>
with the new tendencies in automobiles which point to the fact that in future the<br>
electrical equipment of vehicles is going to be fed with more than 40 volts,<br>
something that can easily be achieved by means of pulse trains.<br>
Depending on the control structure of the different electroelectronic<br>
devices, the possibility exists that at least two multiplexer modules might need<br>
to be activated simultaneously, in which case those multiplexer modules are<br>
planned to have the same identification code and therefore act at the same<br>
time and independently of the place where they are located, when the<br>
processed order concerns that address. In this case, they generate the same<br>
code in the data line when their inputs are acted upon.<br>
Apart from being carried out by means of the electric wires that are<br>
conventionally used for these applications, the wiring is suitable for being<br>
carried out by means of optical fibre, in which case optoelectronic devices have<br>
to be used in order to permit the correct transmission/reception of data and<br>
synchronisation.<br>
The use of optical fibre has been especially conceived for the series<br><br><br>
connection of multiplexer modules.<br>
The multiplexers can be connected in parallel or series.<br>
In said series connection, just the first multiplexer modules comprises<br>
the means of setting up the identification code and the decoder, while the rest<br>
of the modules only comprise the means for detecting the pulse generated. In<br>
this case the first multiplexer module, after its decoder has managed the inputs<br>
and outputs that it expects by means of the synchronisation pulses in the way<br>
already described, inhibits its clock input in the last cycle and activates the<br>
following multiplexer module, in a kind of knock-on effect, for which it allows the<br>
synchronisation signal to pass, and so on successively as far as the last<br>
multiplexer module. In this case, the data connection of the series multiplexer<br>
modules is common to them all, in such a way that series connection is<br>
perfectly compatible with parallel connection.<br>
Series connection has the advantage that the multiplexer modules<br>
present a simpler configuration than in the case of parallel connection, since<br>
just the first multiplexer module needs to carry out the decoding, so this<br>
element has been removed from the rest of the multiplexer modules connected<br>
in series with the first.<br>
On the basis of the description made, it can be understood that the<br>
counters have the means so that in certain addresses they manage the data<br>
inputs, in other words they read that data, and in others they manage the<br>
outputs, in other words they write data.<br>
It can also be understood that the multiplexer modules can receive<br>
analog and/or digital data in their inputs and/or outputs.<br>
According to the description made, all the data of the system provided by<br>
the multiplexer modules circulate along the data line, in which there is always<br>
data present, even if no manoeuvre is being performed, since each multiplexer<br>
module writes its presence code in the system when it detects its identification<br>
code and is not performing any manoeuvre. This property is exploited for<br>
controlling the good state of the data line in such a way that if data does not<br>
appear due to a short-circuit in the wire or any open line, the system gives<br>
warning of the event.<br>
The structure described presents the following advantages:<br>
- It permits the designs for the electric wires to be homogenised for<br>
different models with a minimum use of wires.<br><br><br>
-	It saves on more than 75% of the wiring needed for classical bundles.<br>
-	It avoids a large number of drillings in the vehicle body needed so that<br>
those bundles can pass.<br>
-	It significantly reduces the assembly and connection times in the<br>
production line for vehicles.<br>
-	It facilitates the connection, handling and checking without any<br>
specialised additional labour costs.<br>
-	It facilitates an understanding of the system and provides simplicity of<br>
maintenance.<br>
-	It creates less weight than present systems.<br>
-	It permits an increase in controls and checks on the various electrical<br>
elements of a vehicle by the user, including detection of faults in them.<br>
-	Also, in after-sales, it facilitates rapid checking of the electrical systems<br>
and the replacement of components.<br>
-	Regarding the vehicle manufacturer, it does not generate any greater<br>
technological dependence on third parties than that created by<br>
conventional systems.<br>
-	It permits installation in low range cars since it is less costly.<br>
-	No special wiring is needed for its installation.<br>
-	It permits compatibility with other data systems, or controlled peripherals.<br>
-	it is totally compatible with present-day command and control elements,<br>
such as relays, switches, activators, sensors, etc. (electroelectronic<br>
elements), and it also open up different possibilities for permitting the<br>
incorporation of new command elements with less breaking power, since<br>
they all attack very low consumption electronic circuits which means that<br>
the system of the invention permits the modern and ergonomic design of<br>
those components.<br>
Below, in order to facilitate a better understanding of this specification<br>
and forming an integral part thereof, a series of figures is attached in which, by<br>
way of illustration and not to be regarded as limiting, the object of the invention<br>

DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED FORM OF EMBODIMENT<br>
Given below is a description of the invention based on the figures<br>
commented on above.<br>
The system of the invention consists of a synchronisation generator 2<br>
which is connected to a plurality of multiplexer modules 1a, 1b and 1b'.<br>
The multiplexer modules can be connected in series or parallel. In the<br>
first case it is referenced with 1a, and in the second with 1b, 1b'.<br>
The synchronisation generator 2 generates a clock signal consisting of<br>
pulse trains separated by rest periods 4 in such a way that both times 3 and 4<br>
constitute a sweep 5 which is repeated sequentially and is sent to the different<br><br><br>
multiplexer modules 1a, 1b and 1b' via the synchronisation line 6.<br>
The synchronisation generator 2 is also connected to different<br>
multiplexer modules 1a, 1b and 1b' via a data line 7 for the transmission and<br>
reception of data.<br>
The line 8 represents the common wire essential in electrical<br>
connections.<br>
The system of the invention refers to the lines 6, 7 and 8 as bus line,<br>
such that said bus line constitutes the sole means of connection of the<br>
synchronisation generator to the different multiplexer modules.<br>
Moreover, the different multiplexer modules are connected to<br>
electroelectronic devices consisting of control circuits and electronic elements,<br>
such as might be lamps, sensors, switches, etc., in such a way that they define<br>
inputs and/or outputs for the multiplexer modules.<br>
Therefore, the multiplexer modules incorporate as many inputs and/or<br>
outputs as elements that have to be governed. Represented in figure 9 are<br>
different electroelectronic devices 13-18 to govern by means of the different<br>
multiplexers, for which each of them incorporates a different number of inputs<br>
and/or outputs, as shall be described later on.<br>
The synchronisation generator 2 provides sufficient power for exploiting<br>
the synchronisation signal in order to provide the feed to the different<br>
multiplexer modules of the system, though these modules 1a, 1b, 1b' are<br>
provided with an input for receiving an alternative supply of direct current<br>
coming directly from the battery 9 of the vehicle, which has been represented<br>
by means of the broken line 10.<br>
The advantage of using the synchronisation line for providing feed to the<br>
different multiplexer modules is that it saves on a wire and a connection for<br>
each module, as well as making them independent of the power supply coming<br>
from the battery 9, with which the system is compatible with the new tendencies<br>
in automobiles in which electrical equipment is going to be fed with more than<br>
40 volts in the future.<br>
Figure 2 shows a clock signal in which the rest periods 4 are presented<br>
by means of the logic status "0" while in figure 3 these rest periods 4 are<br>
defined by a "1" depending on the logic used by the multiplexer modules.<br>
The multiplexer modules are provided with a counter which detects the<br>
arrival of the different clock cycles of the pulse train 3 so that with the arrival of<br><br><br>
the first cycle 3a the counters of the multiplexer module count one pulse and so<br>
on successively in such a way that each counter generates a code<br>
corresponding to the cycle number 3a, 3b, 3n, of the pulse train 3.<br>
In addition, the modules 1a and 1b are provided with a microswitch via<br>
which an identifying code is set up for each of the multiplexer modules 1a and<br>
1b, which are connected to a comparator, which also receives the count made<br>
by the counter, such that when the code generated by the counter coincides<br>
with that set up by means of the microswitches the multiplexer module is<br>
activated for managing the inputs and outputs that it is expecting. Also, when<br>
(they receive the rest period 4, the multiplexer modules 1a and 1b detect it in<br>
order to set the counters to zero and start the count again with the following<br>
pulse train.<br>
In order to carry out the setting to zero, provision has been made for the<br>
incorporation of a monostable circuit 11 in the multiplexer modules 1a and 1b,<br>
in which the clock signal CK directly attacks the circuit whose time constant is<br>
regulated by an RC combination (resistor and capacitor). This time constant is<br>
always greater than the duration of a clock cycle and less than the duration of<br>
the time for setting to zero. So, the monostable is being continuously<br>
retriggered by the falling edges of the clock maintaining its output Q in its upper<br>
part constantly at zero, as shown in figure 5. When the CK signal remains at<br>
rest, the monostable stops being triggered and, once the time set by the RC<br>
constant has passed, it changes the value of the output thereby generating the<br>
synchronisation signal for setting to zero of the multiplexer modules.<br>
The number of cycles per sweep and the frequency of them can be<br>
regulated in the synchronisation generator 2 according to needs. This number<br>
is important since it indicates the amount of data that can be processed by the<br>
system. It can also be highlighted that this parameter affects the response<br>
speed of the system since if, for example, the clock has a work frequency of 2<br>
khz and each sweep generates 100 pulses, the time taken in "reading" a certain<br>
datum is a maximum of "0.5" while if 500 pulses are generated it takes "0.25".<br>
If, for example a hundred pieces of data have to be managed working at<br>
a frequency of 1 khz, this means that the hundred pieces of data are read or<br>
written a hundred times in each second, so for practical purposes it can be<br>
considered that, for the functions performed by the multiplexer modules, they<br>
are working in real time.<br><br><br>
In order to further accelerate the reading and writing speed of data in the<br>
data line 7, the clock frequency can be increased, though one has to reach a<br>
compromise value since at higher frequencies, the system becomes more<br>
sensitive to the interferences produced by breaking currents and it also needs<br>
special wiring.<br>
As far as the data line 7 is concerned, it can be mentioned that each<br>
multiplexer modules writes the data in the line via a transistor 12 (figure 6),<br>
which in the example of embodiment, is an open collector line transistor, being<br>
NPN or PNP, depending on the logics that are applied in the rest status of the<br>
line 7, therefore the line 7 will have to be positive or negative polarised.<br>
Once a multiplexer module has detected its identification code and<br>
wishes to write a datum in the data line 7, it excites the transistor 12 to<br>
saturation, placing it in short-circuit and forcing the line to set its polarisation<br>
voltage to zero if it is NPN or the reverse if it is PNP. In the example of figure 6<br>
NPN type transistors 12 have been represented.<br>
Also, each of the multiplexer modules has a logic input device connected<br>
(not shown in the figures) by means of which the information circulating through<br>
the data line 7 is read, capturing the data present in them when the multiplexer<br>
module has been selected.<br>
Each multiplexer module has a time for transmitting and reading the<br>
information corresponding to each of its inputs and outputs, and which is<br>
determined by the address corresponding to the identification code of each<br>
multiplexer module, whose counters include a suitable combination of logic<br>
gates which allow the module to be available during a certain number of cycles<br>
for reading or writing data corresponding to the inputs and outputs included in<br>
each multiplexer module.<br>
The invention provides that in one embodiment, as shown in figure 7, the<br>
multiplexer has a clock cycle for writing or reading a datum; and moreover in<br>
another embodiment it provides that a datum can be read or written with each<br>
half clock cycle, as shown in figure 8.<br>
With regard to figure 7, the first pulse 3a corresponds to the address 1,<br>
and, as can be seen in this sweep, there is no active data (inverse logic), in<br>
such a way that the time for transmitting its information in the address 1 lies<br>
between the rising edge of the first clock cycle and the rising edge of the<br>
second clock cycle. In the cycles 2, 3, 5 and 3n it can be seen how data is<br><br><br>
being transmitted but not in the rest. Once all the data of the sweep has been<br>
transmitted the setting to zero can be seen after which a new sweep starts in<br>
which the data might have varied its status, as happens in cycle number 3<br>
which has gone from "0" to "1", so to each address there corresponds a clock<br>
cycle during which the selected module has to write or read the datum present<br>
in the data line 7.<br>
As far as figure 8 is concerned, it can be stated that, as in the above<br>
case, the first clock pulse 3a corresponds to address 1, and as can be seen<br>
before the first clock cycle, which is known as channel 1, there is an active<br>
datum (inverse logic), while in the following semi-period, which is known as<br>
channel 2, there is no active datum. Therefore the time for transmitting the<br>
information in the address 1 in channel 1 is shared between the rising edge of<br>
the first rising cycle of clock 3a and the falling edge of the same clock cycle<br>
pulse, in cycles 2, 3, 5 and n it can be seen how transmission is taking place in<br>
both channel 1 and channel 2.<br>
Nevertheless, in cycle 4 the channel 1 has an inactive datum, and<br>
channel 2 an active datum. Once all the data of the sweep have been<br>
transmitted, the setting to zero is detected, already mentioned above, starting<br>
from which a new sweep begins in which the data can have varied its status, as<br>
is observed in cycle 1, channel 2 which passes from inactive to active and cycle<br>
3 which has passed from inactive to active in channel 1 and channel 2.<br>
Therefore, in this case, as in the previous one, the dedicated time in the<br>
data line to each address is equal to one clock cycle, but with the difference<br>
that two pieces of data are being managed for each clock cycle, for which there<br>
has to be a suitable combination of logic gates permitting the two pieces of data<br>
to be decoded unequivocally without the counters changing their logic address.<br>
In this case, if, instead of handling two pieces of status data, what it is<br>
wished to process is a value of a certain analog element, for example the value<br>
of a temperature, the analog digital converter is connected to the logic inputs of<br>
a multiplexer module. Assuming that the converter has a resolution of 8 bits,<br>
this will consume eight pieces of data of the system just by addressing four<br>
clock counting positions, with which there will be a processing capacity of 256<br>
different values in just 4 clock bits.<br>
The system is therefore synchronous.<br>
Modules 1a are connected in parallel with the lines 6, 7 and 8 while<br><br><br>
modules 1b and 1b' are connected in series, the functioning of the modules<br>
connected in series 1b and 1b' being different from that of modules 1a, as<br>
described below.<br>
Module 1b functions in the way already described, consuming the<br>
necessary clock cycles corresponding to it for managing each input and output,<br>
but with the difference that with the last cycle it activates a signal which detains<br>
the clock count of its counter, using this signal in a kind of knock-on effect for<br>
enabling the following multiplexer module 1b', and also it allows the<br>
synchronisation signal to pass, this same process being successively repeated<br>
with the following module 1b' connected in series.<br>
As a consequence, the modules 1b' do not incorporate a decoder nor an<br>
identification code since their code corresponds to that of the first module 1 b<br>
which is the one that detects the identification code and carries out the<br>
activation of the following modules connected in series 1b' as has been<br>
described.<br>
So, for example, in the event that the modules 1 b and 1 b' are of eight<br>
pieces of data each, between inputs and outputs, their construction and<br>
configuration would be as if they were a single module for a system which can<br>
only process eight addresses detected by the first module 1b, in such a way<br>
that, once the first eight clock cycles have passed, it exploits the falling edge of<br>
the last pulse in order to inhibit its clock input leaving it at rest, provoking after<br>
the setting to zero time the addressing to the zero position in its counter, with<br>
which the functioning philosophy corresponds to that already described.<br>
The signal used for inhibiting the clock input is also used for facilitating<br>
that of the following module 1 b', being successively repeated for the following<br>
modules 1b' as already described.<br>
It is important to state that in the series connection the data line 7<br>
presents continuous steps between the different modules 1b-1b', therefore the<br>
system is a hundred percent compatible with parallel connections.<br>
Represented in figure 1 are modules 1a connected in parallel with the<br>
output of the last module 1b', and their functioning is identical to that already<br>
described for the parallel modules, since the passage is allowed of the<br>
synchronisation signal between the different modules 1b' and the data line is<br>
common for them all.<br>
The bus can consist of electrical wires, but the possibility also exists that<br><br>
it can consist of fibre optic cables, which are especially recommended for the<br>
case in which the modules are connected in series.<br>
In the event of using optical fibre, it is connected to the input of an<br>
optoelectronic transducer which electronically activates the same point when<br>
the cable is used, due to which starting from that point the system behaves the<br>
same as with electrical wire.<br>
Afterwards the signal is summed to that processed by the actual<br>
multiplexer module in order to write in the data line using the same output<br>
transistor as represented in figure 6, with the difference that in this case,<br>
'instead of attacking the polarised data line, it excites the LED of an optocoupler<br>
for optical fibre.<br>
This fibre enters into the following multiplexer module exciting an<br>
optoelectronic transducer, injecting it with the data that has been summed from<br>
the previous modules or coming from the bus in the case of a mixed system,<br>
and so on successively.<br>
By way of example, figure 9 shows different devices that can be<br>
governed by the multiplexer modules, for which four multiplexers of six outputs<br>
and one multiplexer of thirty-one outputs and ten inputs have been provided.<br>
So, for example, those that govern six outputs are dedicated to activation of the<br>
outside lights 13, horn 15, fan 16, rear window heater 17 and windscreen wiper<br>
motor 18. For the multiplexer module with ten inputs and thirty-one outputs, it is<br>
provided in the control panel for detecting the status of the various switches 19<br>
and activating the corresponding optical indicators 14.<br>
Represented in figure 9 is the battery 9 without being connected to the<br>
multiplexer modules, though as in the example of figure 1 it could be connected<br>
to them.<br><br>
