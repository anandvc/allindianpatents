				<td>SPECIFICATION<br>
METHOD OF REDUCTIVE DEHALOGENATION<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a method of producing f luorocyclopropane useful for producing an excellent compound for pharmaceutical agents or agricultural chemicals.<br>
Background Art<br>
Within the synthetic new quinolone antibacterial agents/ quinolone derivatives containing a<br>
1,2-cis-2-fluorocyclopropyl group as a substituent at the 1-position have a strong antibacterial activity and are highly safe at the same time, and thus expected to be an excellent synthetic antibacterial agent. To prepare such 1,2-cis-2-fluorocyclopropyl group,<br>
I,2-cis-2-fluorocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid is useful. This compound is produced by dechlorinating l-chloro-2-fluorocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid ester in dimethyl sulfoxide in the presence of sodium borohydride (Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 6-157418). However, this dechlorination reaction has a problem that when a stirring blade is used in the stirring step with the view of industrial production, it takes several days to complete the reaction, and therefore establishment of a convenient product ion method with a reduced reaction time has been desired.<br><br>
In addition, since dimethyl sulfoxide generates dimethyl sulf ide which is responsible for foul odor during the reaction, there has been a problem of harmful effects on the environment.<br>
Under such circumstances, an object of the present invention is to provide a method of producing 2-fluorocyclopropane-l-carboxylic acid ester by efficiently dehalogenating<br>
l-halogeno-2-fluorocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid ester, which method is also applicable to apparatuses for industrial production.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
The inventors of the present invention have conducted intensive studies on dehalogenation reaction of l-halogeno-2-fluorocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid ester, and found a method of producing<br>
2-f luorocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid ester which comprises allowing l-halogeno-2-f luorocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid ester to react with a reducing agent in a two-phase system in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst, which method is also applicable to industrial scale production, and has completed the present invention.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a method of producing 2-fluorocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid ester (2) , characterized by allowing a compound represented by the following formula (I) :<br><br>

Examples of the alkenyl group having 2 to 8 carbon atoms include a vinyl group and a 1-isopropenyl group. Examples of the aralkyl group composed of an aryl group having 6 to 12 carbon atoms and an alkylene group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms include a benzyl group and a phenethyl group. The aryl group constituting the aralkyl group may be further substituted by the above-mentioned alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, the above-mentioned alkoxy group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, a cyano group, a nitro group, a halogen atom, an amino group, a hydroxy group, a carboxy group or the like.<br>
As R1, an alkyl group having 1 to 8 carbon atoms is preferable, and a methyl group, an ethyl group, a butyl group, a sec-butyl group and a t-butyl group are more preferable, and a t-butyl group is even more preferable. When R1 is a t-butyl group, an effect of preventing generation of a by-product (l-chloro-2-fluoro-1-hydroxymethyl cyclopropane) can be observed.<br>
The compound (1) can be easily synthesized from 1-chloro-cyclopropane-l,2-dicarboxylic acid-1-t-butyl<br><br>

These alkoxy groups or acyloxy groups may be further substituted by a halogen atom or the like. Specific examples of the alkoxy group or the acyloxy group include an acetyloxy group, a trif luoroacetyloxy group, a benzoyloxy group and a benzylcarbonyloxy group. It may also be an N-isobutyloxycarbonylprolyloxy group or an N-benzyloxycarbonylprolyloxy group. Here, m is an integer of 1 to 4 and n is an integer of 0 to 3, and the sum of m and n is 4 .<br>
The compound (3) may be generally selected from sodium borohydride, lithium borohydride, zinc borohydride, sodium cyano borohydride and sodium alkoxyborohydride . As an alkoxy group of sodium alkoxyborohydride, alkoxy groups having 1 to 6 carbon atoms are preferable, and sodium borohydride is more preferable.<br><br>
The reducing agent is used in an amount in the range of preferably from 1.0 to 10.0 equivalents, more preferably 1.5 to 3.5 equivalents with regard to the compound represented by the formula (1).<br>
Examples of the phase transfer catalyst used herein include quaternary ammonium salts such as tetraethylammonium chloride, tetrabutylammonium chloride, tetrabutylammonium bromide, tetrabutylammonium iodide, tetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulfate and trioctylmethylammonium chloride, quaternary phosphonium salts such as tetrabutylphosphonium chloride and tetrabutylphosphonium bromide, and crown ether. Among these, quaternary ammonium salts are preferable, and as the quaternary ammonium salt, trioctylmethylammonium chloride, tetrabutylammonium chloride, tetrabutylammonium bromide and tetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulfate are preferable, with trioctylmethylammonium chloride being more preferable. When using a quaternary phosphonium salt, tetrabutylphosphonium chloride is preferable.<br>
The phase transfer catalyst is used in the range of preferably from 1.0 to 30% by mole, more preferably from 10 to 20% by mole with regard to the compound represented by the formula (1).<br>
Referring to the reaction solvent, it is preferable to use a combination of water and any of the solvents listedbelow. As the solvent, ether solvents such as dialkyl ether (diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, methyl t-butyl ether, ethyl t-butyl ether, methyl n-butyl ether, ethyl n-butyl ether, cyclopentyl methyl ether and the like); aromatic solvents such as toluene<br><br>
and benzene; ester solvents such as ethyl acetate; polar solvents such as tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile, N,N-dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide and alcohol; aliphatic solvents such as hexane, heptane, octane and cyclohexane; and the like may be used. Of these non-polar solvents are preferable, anddiisopropyl ether, methyl t-butyl ether, cyclopentyl methyl ether, toluene, hexane, heptane, octane and cyclohexane are more preferable, andmethyl t-butyl ether and heptane are particularly preferable.  In addition, a mixture of two or more solvents may be used.  In view of the reaction rate, the solubility and the proportion of generated diastereomers of the compound (2), methyl t-butyl ether and heptane are preferable.  The mixing ratio of water and the solvent is in the range of preferably from 1:8 to 1:1, more preferably from 1:4 to 1:1. The total amount of solvent is in the range of preferably from 1 to 5 (v/w) , more preferably from2 to 4 (v/w) basedonthe compound representedby the formula (1) .<br>
As the reaction solvent, water alone may be used, or a diluted hydrochloric acid or an aqueous sodium hydroxide solution may also be used.<br>
In the method of production according to the present invention, the compound (2) may be produced by a reaction with a reducing agent in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst for 1 to 24 hours. Depending on the kind of the solvent, the reaction may be completed in a few hours.<br>
The reaction may be effected in a temperature range of from 5 to 60°C, preferably from 10 to 50°C, more preferably<br><br>
from 15 to 30°C. When the calorific value is great upon the reaction, it is desirable to effect the reaction under cooling.<br>
After completion of the reaction, the compound (2) is collected from the reaction mixture according to a method usually employed.  For example, the compound (2) can be collected by removing inorganic substances as an aqueous layer and distilling off the solvent in the organic layer. The obtained target compound can be further purified by distillation or chromatography according to need. The compound (2) can be prepared by these procedures.<br>
The configuration of the fluorine atom at the 2-position and the carboxylic acidmoiety at the 1-position of the compound (2) includes two types: one is a configuration in which both are present on the same side of a plane of a cyclopropane ring (cis-form) and the other is a configuration in which each is present on a different side of a plane of a cyclopropane ring (trans-form). According to the method of production of the present invention, the cis-form and the trans-form are produced in a proportion range of 87:13 to 97:3.  The method of production of the present invention is thus excellent for producing 1,2-cis-2-fluorocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid which is a synthetic intermediate for synthetic new quinolone antibacterial agents. In the method of production of the present invention, the content of the trans-form is decreased compared to the content thereof before the start of the reaction, while the content of the cis-form in the reaction mixture is increased after the reaction. Accordingly, the objective<br><br>
cis-forms can be advantageously obtained by the method of the present invention.<br>
1,2-cis-2-Fluorocyclopropane-l-carboxylic acid can be produced by optical resolution according to a usual method after deriving 2-fluorocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid from 2-fluorocyclopropane-l-carboxylic acid ester which is a mixture of diastereomers obtained by the method of production according to the present invention.<br>
Optical resolution can be carried out by preferential crystallization, diastereomer synthesis, an enzymatic method, chromatography or others. Specifically, for example, after hydrolyzing 2-fluorocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid ester, the hydrolyzed product (racemic form) is allowed to react with an optical resolution agent to prepare a mixture of diastereomer salts of optically active 2-fluorocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid and an optical resolution agent, and after separating desired diastereomer salts by precipitation or the like, the separated diastereomer salts are treated with alkali. Then the obtained optically active compound is isolated.<br>
In this regard, since cis-form and trans-form of an ester compound can be separated by a distillation procedure, efficiency of optical resolution can be increased by preparing an ester compound from which trans-forms are removed by a distillation procedure in advance and using a carboxylic acid compound obtained by hydrolyzing the ester compound.<br>
As the optical resolution agent, (+)and(-)-N-benzyl-a-methylbenzylamine,<br><br>
(+)and(-)-a-methylbenzylamine, (+)and(-)-a-ethylbenzylamine, (+)and(-)-(p-tolyl)ethylamine, (+)and(-)-phenyl-2-(p-tolyl)ethylamine, ( + )and(-)-erythro-2-amino-l,2-diphenylethanol, (+)and(-)-1-{1-naphthyl)ethyl amine, (+)and(-)-cis-2-(benzylamino)cyclohexane methanol, (+)and(-)-a-methyl-p-nitrobenzylamine and the like may be used and appropriately selected depending on the optical isomer of 2-fluorocyclopropane-l-carboxylic acid to be obtained. The optical resolution agent is preferably reacted in dialkyl ether, and examples of dialkyl ether include methyl t-butyl ether, ethyl t-butyl ether, methyl n-butyl ether, ethyl n-butyl ether and cyclopentyl methyl ether. Of these, methyl t-butyl ether is preferably used.<br>
For alkali treatment of diastereomer salt, bases like alkali metal hydroxides such as sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide, alkali metal carbonates such as sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate and alkali metal hydrogen carbonates such as sodium hydrogen carbonate and potassium hydrogen carbonate are usually used.<br>

temperature and ethanol was removed under reduced pressure. To the obtained residue was added 1 N hydrochloric acid under cooling with ice so that the pH became pH 2 or lower, and<br>
extraction by methyl t-butyl ether was conducted (15 mL x 2) . The organic layer was dried over magnesium sulfate and methyl t-butyl ether was removed under reduced pressure to give a racemic form of 2-f luorocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid. The racemic form was dissolved in methyl t-butyl ether (30 mL) and with stirring the mixture at room temperature,<br>
(R) - ( + ) -N-benzyl-ot-methylbenzylamine (1.0 equivalent) was added thereto dropwise. The precipitated diastereomer salt of 1, 2-cis-2-fluorocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid and (R)-(+)-N-benzyl-a-methylbenzylamine was recrystallized in isopropyl ether (45 mL) (yield: 1.51 g, optical purity: 99%e.e.).  Subsequently, a 2 N aqueous sodium hydroxide solution (4.7mL) was added to the obtained diastereomer salt,<br>
and the mixture was washed with chloroform (10 mL x 2), and the aqueous layer was neutralized with 6 N hydrochloric acid (5mL) . After the neutralization, extractionby ethyl acetate was conducted (10 mL x 3), and the organic layer was dried over magnesium sulfate and ethyl acetate was removed under reduced pressure to give the title compound (yield: 478. 3 mg, optical purity: 99%e.e.).<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
By using the met hod of product ion of the present invention, the reaction time of a dehalogenation reaction of '-halogeno-2-fluorocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid ester can<br><br>
be significantly shortened as compared to the reaction time in previous methods . In particular, even in the case of using an apparatus for industrial production, the reaction can be completed in a shorter time. Furthermore, because dimethyl sulfoxide is not used as a reaction solvent in the method of production according to the present invention, the problem of generation of dimethyl sulfide has also been solved. Accordingly, the method of production of the present invention is industrially applicable as a method of producing a synthetic rawmaterial for synthetic new quinolone antibacterial agents .<br><br><br>
