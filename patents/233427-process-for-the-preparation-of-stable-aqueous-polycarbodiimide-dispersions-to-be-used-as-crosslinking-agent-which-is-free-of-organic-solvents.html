				<td>Process for the preparation of stable polycarbodiimide dispersions in water, which are free of organic solvents and may be used as crosslinking agent.<br>
Polycarbodiimides are well known crosslinking agents for aqueous resins containing carboxylic acid functions. Most commercially available polycarbodiimide crosslinkers are dissolved in an organic solvent, which is disadvantageous for environmental reasons. Further, they have to be mixed with either water, or'water and a surfactant, before they can be mixed with the aqueous resin. Generally, these aqueous dispersions are not stable and have to be freshly prepared daily. Only aqueous tet-ramethylxylene diisocyanate based polycarbodiimides are stable in water as described in US 5688875 (=EP 0686626) and US 5859166. However, a disadvantage of these polycarbodiimides is that the conditions for the carbodiimide formation from tetramethylxylene diisocyanate are rather •extreme: 22 hrs at 180°C are required and 2 % of a carbodiimide catalyst. Further tetramethylxylene diisocyanate based polycarbodiimides are slower and less efficient crosslinkers than isophorone diisocyanate or 4,4'-dicyclohexylmethane diisocyanate based crosslinkers.<br>
Aqueous polycarbodiimide dispersions obtained from isophorone diisocyanate and from 4,4'-dicyclohexylmethane diisocyanate as described in US 5856014, US 5958516, US 6127029, US 6127477, are not stable. The carbodiimide amounts from commercial aqueous polycarbodiimide products (Carbodilites from Nisshinbo Industries) decrease in a stability test at 50° within 6 weeks to 15-70 % of the original value.<br>
The object.of the present invention is to provide a process in which the disadvantages mentioned above are eliminated.<br>
Description of the invention<br>
According to the present invention there is pro-<br><br>
vided a process for the preparation of stable aqueous polycarbodiimide dispersions, to be used as crosslinking agent, which are free of organic solvents, characterised in:<br>
- --v reacting a polyisocyanate in the presence of a car-bodiimide catalyst to form a polycarbodiimide, terminating and/or chain extending the polycarbodiimide chain by the addition of a compound containing a hydrophilic group and one or more amine and/or hydroxy functions during or after the polycarbodiimide formation,<br>
dispersion of the resulting compound in water, wherein the pH is adjusted between 9 and 14 by the addition of a base or a buffer to the water used for the dispersion and/or to the obtained aqueous dispersion. Alternatively stable aqueous polyisocyanate based polycarbodiimide dispersions can be obtained when the capping or chain extension with the compound containing a hydrophilic group and one or more amine functions is not effected during or. after the polycarbodiimide formation, but occurs during or after the dispersion of the polycarbodiimide in water.<br>
Surprisingly the stability of the polycarbodiimide dispersions was significantly increased at higher pH values and the carbodiimide concentration was not decreased within 8 weeks at 50°C. Preferrably at the end of the process the pH will be adjusted to a value between 11 and 13.<br>
Conventional carbodiimide catalysts as described in EP 878496 may be used. Surprisingly, it appeared that the reaction temperature and the reaction time could be reduced when 1-methylphospholene-l-oxide was used as catalyst and for this reason this catalyst is preferred.<br>
The polyisocyanate which is used to prepare the polycarbodiimide is a conventional polyisocyanate and may be toluene-2,4-diisocyanate, toluene-2,6- diisocyanate and mixtures thereof, diphenylmethane-4,4-diisocyanate, 1,4-phenylenediisocyanate, dicyclohexylmethane-4, 4 ' -<br><br>
diisocyanate, 3-isocyanatomethyl-3,5,5-<br>
trimethylcyclohexylisocyanate, 1,6-hexyldiisocyanate, 1,4-cyclohexyl-diisocyanate , norbonyldiisocyanate diisocyanate, or a mixture thereof and is preferably dicyclohexyl-methane-4,4'-diisocyanate.<br>
"X.   The base which is used to adjust the pH may be an alkali hydroxide such as lithium hydroxyde, sodium hy-droxyde, potassium hydroxide, or a trialkylamine or a tri-alkylamine containing hydroxyl functions. Optionally, the base or part of the base may be incorporated in the poly-carbodiimide chain by capping the polycarbodiimide chain with a dialkylaminoalkyl-amine or alcohol, and/or by the addition of 0.01-0.3 equivalents regarding to the diisocyanate of a tertiary amine containing polyol or polyamine during or after the polycarbodiimide formation.<br>
A buffer may be used to fix the pH value. Useful buffers are those with an effective pH range between 9 and 14.<br>
The compound containing a hydrophilic group and one or more amine and/or hydroxyl functions is a polyeth-oxy mono- or diol, a polyethoxy/polypropoxy mono- or diol, a polyethoxy mono- or diamine, a polyethoxy/polypropoxy mono- or diamine, a diol or diamine with a polyalkoxy side chain, an hydroxy- or ajnine alkylsulfonate, or a dialkyla-minoalkyl- alcohol or amine.<br>
The polycarbodiimide dispersions of the invention may be used as a crosslinker for carboxylic group containing resins in a conventional way: a coating mixture comprising the polycarbodiimide dispersion of the invention and an aqueous resin containing carboxylic acid functions, is prepared. The material is cured by applying the coating mixture to a substrate, for example leather or artificial leather, and evaporating the water. Many additional ingredients may be present, for example fillers, colorants, pigments, silicons, surfactants and the like.<br>
For several applications it is advantageous when the distance between the carbodiimide functions in the molecule is increased. In this way the crosslinking is<br><br>
less rigid, the coatings will be more flexible and problems such as greying, which is an effect that the coating is turning greyish and mat at stretching, or brittleness of the coatings may be prevented. Therefore flexible segments may be incorporated in the polycarbodiimide chain as a "spacer" to separate the carbodiimide functions, For this interest 0.01-0.30 equivalents of a mono- or polyol or a mono- or polyamine regarding to the polyisocyanate are added before, during or after the polycarbodiimide formation, which polyol or polyamine is for example a mono or polyhydroxy-alkane, a polyether mono-or polyol, a polyester polyol, a polycarbonate polyol, a polycaprolactam polyol, a mono- or polyamino-alkane, a polyether mono-or polyamine.<br>
The polycarbodiimide dispersions of the invention have several advantages: - the dispersions are stable -the polycarbodiimide is an aqueous dispersion and can be easily mixed with an aqueous resin containing carboxylic acid functions - the products are solvent free and no volatile organic vapours escape during the application - the carbodiimide formation with 4,4'- dicyclohexylmethylene diisocyanate (and isophorone diisocyanate) with 1-methylphospholene-1-oxide as carbodiimide catalyst takes less extreme condition's than the procedure with the diiso-cyanates described in US 5688875 and US 5859166.<br>
