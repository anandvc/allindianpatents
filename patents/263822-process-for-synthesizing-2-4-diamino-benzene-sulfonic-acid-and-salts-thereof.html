Process for Synthesizing 2,4-diaminobenzene<br>
Sulfonic Acid And Salts Thereof<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a process for synthesizing 2,4-diaminobenzene<br>
sulfonic acid and salts thereof.<br>
Background Art<br>
2,4-diaminobenzene sulfonic acid, also named m-phenylene<br>
diamine-4-sulfonic acid, has a structure as follows:<br><br>
2,4-diaminobenzene sulfonic acid and salts thereof (especially its sodium salt)<br>
are used mainly as important intermediates for synthesizing dyes. Their derivative<br>
products have been widely used in industrial production and daily life.<br>
A conventional method for preparing 2,4-diaminobenzene sulfonic acid<br>
comprises reacting 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene as the starting material with sodium<br>
bisulfite, followed by reduction. The drawbacks of this method include low yield,<br>
poor product quality and low production efficiency.<br>
Another method for preparing 2,4-diaminobenzene sulfonic acid as disclosed<br>
in the prior art (e.g. Japanese Patent Publication No. S57-48961 and<br>
Japanese Patent Publication No. H4-13657) comprises dissolving m-phenylene<br>
diamine as the starting material in sulfuric acid amounting to over 5 times by<br>
weight of the amount of m-phenylene diamine, followed by sulfonating<br><br>
m-phenylene diamine with fuming sulfuric acid or S03 gas as the sulfonating agent<br>
to obtain 2,4-diaminobenzene sulfonic acid as the final product. One drawback of<br>
this method is the need of a large amount of sulfuric acid which is in an amount of<br>
at least over 5 times or even more by weight of the amount of m-phenylene diamine.<br>
Since the sulfuric acid can only be expelled in the form of waste solution due to can<br>
not being subjected to effective recovery, this method leads to serious pollution to<br>
the environment while adds to the cost of the production of 2,4-diaminobenzene<br>
sulfonic acid. The other drawback of this method is the use of S03 gas as the<br>
sulfonating agent. It will render the process more complex to store, transport,<br>
utilize and recover the gas source of S03. Furthermore, safety constitutes another<br>
concern.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The object of the invention is to provide a process for preparing<br>
2,4-diaminobenzene sulfonic acid, which can solve the environment pollution<br>
problem in the prior art caused by using a large amount of sulfuric acid and the<br>

simple procedure, and higher yield, product quality and manufacturing efficiency.<br>
After intensive research, the inventors of the invention have found that when<br>
2,4-diaminobenzene sulfonic acid is prepared by sulfonating m-phenylene diamine<br>
with sulfuric acid or fuming sulfuric acid in a given solvent, the problem in the<br>

sulfuric acid) and 100 g 100% m-phenylene diamine were added into a reactor, and<br>
the temperature was raised to 195°C. After 6 hours of reaction at 195-200 °C, the<br>
resultant mixture was cooled, and 400 mL water was added. The water phase was<br>
purified and decolorized to give 168.0 g 2,4-diaminobenzene sulfonic acid. As<br>

and the water phase were separated, wherein the organic phase could be used as the<br>
solvent for next batch of reaction, and the water phase was purified and decolorized<br>
to give 170 g 2,4-diaminobenzene sulfonic acid. As white crystal, the resultant<br>
product had its chromatographic content determined to be 99% (determined by<br>
HPLC), and its chemical content determined to be 98% (determined by<br>
diazotization titration). The yield of the product was 95.7% (based on m-phenylene<br>
diamine).<br>
