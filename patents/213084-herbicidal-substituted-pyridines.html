DESCRIPTION<br>
Herbicidal substituted pyridines, their preparation, and their use as herbicides and plant growth regulators<br>
It is known that substituted pyridines may possess herbicidal and plant growth regulating properties (cf., e.g.. EP-A-0955300, WO 98/04550. EP-A-0955292. WO 00/75112. WO 01/00580. and WO 99/28301), In some cases, however, in the course of their use, these compounds have disadvantages, such as high persistency or inadequate selectivity in important crops, for example. Furthermore, EP-A-0196184 describes substituted pyridines.<br>
Special 2,6-substituted pyridines have now been found which can be used with advantges as herbicides and plant growth regulators.<br>

B        is an acyl radical such as [(C1-C8)alkyl]-carbonyl such as linear or branched [(C1-C8)-alkyl]-carbonyl or [(C3-C6)cycloalkyl]-carbonyl, each of the radicals being unsubstituted or substituted, for example, by one or more radicals from the group consisting of halogen, (C1-C8)alkoxy, (C1-C8)alkylthio, (C1-C8)alkylsulfinyl.

Of particular interest are inventive compounds of the formula (I) and/or salts thereof<br>
in which<br>
A        is a phenyl, pyridyl, pyrazolyl or thienyl radical which is attached to X via a carbon atom and is unsubstituted or substituted by one or more radicals from the group consisting of halogen, CN, (C1-C8)alkyl, (C1-C8lalkoxy, (C1-C8)haloalkyl, (C1-C8)haloalkylthio, (C1-C8)haloalkyloxy, and (C1-C8)alkoxyalkyloxy. Preferred radicals A are those in which a substituted<br><br>
R14 is present in position 3 of the radical A, relative to the carbon atom which is attached to the group X in the formula (I),<br>
Particularly preferred compounds of the formula (I) and/or salts thereof are those in which A is a substituted phenyl, pyridyl, thienyl or pyrazolyl radical of the following<br><br>
in which<br>
R14     is identical or different at each occurrence and is halogen, cyano or an<br>
optionally substituted (C1-C8)alkyl group, such as (C1-C8)haloalkyl, preferably<br>
CF3 or cyano,<br><br>
Very particular preference is given to compounds of the formula (!') and/or salts thereof<br><br><br>
L        is identical or different at each occurrence and is H or halogen such as<br>
fluorine or chlorine, W-V   together are N-CH-CH, S-CH, CH-CH-CH or N-N(CH3), and B        is an acyl radical such as [(C1-C8)alkyl]-carbonyl such as linear or branched [(C1-C8)-alkyl]-carbonyl or [(C3-C6)cycloalkyl]-carbonyl, or (C1-C8)alkylsulfonyl. such as linear or branched C1-C8-alkylsulfonyl or (C3-C8)cycloalkylsulfonyl, each of the radicals being unsubstituted or substituted by one or more radicals from the group consisting of halogen, especially fluorine or chlorine, CN, (C1-C8)-alkoxy, and (C1-C8)alkylthio.<br>
The inventive compounds of the formula (I) can be prepared by known methods. The following are examples of syntheses that are of particular interest.<br>
Starting from compounds of the formula (II)<br><br>
in which the radicals R1 are as defined for formula (I) and L is a leaving group such as halogen or pseudohalogen or a group of the formula A-X-, where A and X are as defined for formula (I), it is possible, by a route known from the literature, first to alkylate the oxygen of the N-oxide and then react the product with cyanides to give nitriles of the formula (III) (see, for example, W.R. Fife and E.F,V. Seriven, Heterocycles 22, 2375 (1984) and literature cited therein),<br><br>
in which R1 and L are as defined for formula (II),<br>
Pyridine N-oxides of the formula (II) can be prepared by various processes from<br><br>
suitably substituted pyridines. General synthesis methods are described, for example, in A. Albini and S. Pietra, Heterocyclic N-Oxides, CRS-Press, Inc., Boca Raton, USA, 1991,<br>
As alkylating agents for compounds of the formula (II) it is possible with preference [0 use alkylhalogens or alkylpseudohalogens such as dimethyl sulfate or methyl iodide; examples of cyanides used are alkali metal or alkaline earth metal cyanides or cyanides of organic bases such as quaternary ammonium salts (see, for example, Ellman, Tetrahedron 41 (1985) 4941 -4948).<br>
Compounds of the formula (III) in which U is a leaving group such as halogen or pseudohalogen can be reacted with compounds of the formula (IV) or salts thereof<br><br>
where A and X are as defined for formula (I) to give compounds of the formula (III) (see, for example, US 6,080,861, US 6,130,188, and WO 94/22833 and literature cited therein) in which U is a group of the formula A-X-. The compounds of the formula (ill) in which L' is a group A-X- in which A. X, and R^ are as defined for formula (I) can be converted by suitable reduction methods into the amino compounds of the formula (V).<br><br>
The reduction of nitriles to amines is diversely described in the literature (see, for example, Eugen Muller, Methoden der organischen Chemie (Houben-Weyl) volume Xl/1, Nitrogen compounds II, p. 343 ff.. Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart 1957). Suitable hydrogenations include those catalyzed by noble metals, with palladium-and platinum-catalyzed reactions being of particular interest but reductions with<br><br>
Raney nickel also being possible.<br>
Compounds of the formula (V) can be reacted with acylating reagents such as acid halides, isocyanates. carbamoyl chlorides, chloroformic esters, sulfonyl chlorides, sulfamoyl chlorides, sulfenyl chlorides or isothiocyanates to give compounds of the formual (I) in which R6 = H, m = 0 and A, X, R1 R2 R3, and B are as defined for formula (I). An entry point to general and specific chemical methods of acylation can be found, for example, in: Jerry March, Advanced Organic Chemistry (Reaction, Mechanisms and Structure 4th Edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1992),<br>
The compounds of the formula (I) In which R6 is, for example, an unsubstituted or substituted alkyl group are obtainable starting from compounds of the formula (V), which are alkylated with corresponding aldehydes, by reductive alkylation, to give compounds of the formula (VI) (ref.: Rylander Hydrogenation Methods, Academic Press, New York, 1985 pp. 92 - 93).<br><br>
Compounds of the formula (VI) are also obtainable by reducing the corresponding amides (see. for example, Example 3a) (see, for example, Gaylord, Reduction with Complex Metal Hydrides, Wiley, New York 1956, pp. 322 - 373). Suitable for this purpose are, for example, borane complexes such as borane-tetrahydrofuran complexes or borane-dimethyl sulfide complexes (see, for example. Brown G. R, A. J. Foubister, J. Chem. Soc. Perk. T. 1 (8), 1401 -1403 (1989)). The compounds of the formula (VI) can then be acylated by known methods. Compounds of the formula (VI) where R6 = optionally substituted alkenyl or alkynyl are available by reductive amination from compounds of the formula (III). The compounds of the formula (VI) can then be acylated by known methods to give compounds of the formula (1). Compounds of the formula (I) where R6 = acyl are obtainable, for<br><br>
example, by known methods, by appropriate N-acylation of compounds of the formula (VI) where R6 = H.<br>
Compounds of the formula (I) where R6 = hydroxyl and alkoxy are obtainable, for example, in accordance with the following reaction scheme:<br><br>
Nitriles of the formula (III) can be converted reductively Into aldehydes of the formula (XII) (see, for example, Miller, Biss, Schwartzmann; J. Org. Chem. 1970, 35, 858; or Jerry March, Advanced Organic Chemistry (Reaction, Mechanisms and Structure) 4*^ Edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1992, pp. 919, 920). The aldehydes of the formula (XII) can be reduced by known methods to the corresponding alcohols of the formula (XIII) (see. for example, Hudlicky, Reductions in Organic Chemistry; Ellis Norwood; Chichester 1984, pp. 96-129. For list of possible reagents see Larock; Comprehensive Organic Transformations VCH: New York, 1989. p. 993). The hydroxyl groups of the alcohols of the formula (XIII) can then be converted into leaving groups L'. As a leaving group it is possible, for example, to introduce halogens such as chlorine or bromine (see, for example, Wiley, Hershkowitz. Rein Chung, J. Am. Chem. Soc 1964, 86. 964 ; Schaefer, Weinberg J. Org. Chem. 1965. 30, 2635) or sulfonic ester groups such as tosylates or mesylates (see, for example, Crossland, Wells. Shiner; J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1971, 93, 4217). The compounds of the formula (XIV) can then be reacted with hydroxylamines or with 0-alkylated hydroxylamines to give compounds of the formula (VI) in which R6 = hydroxyl or<br><br>
alkoxy. These reactions are preferably conducted in the presence of organic or inorganic bases in an inert solvent. The compounds of the formula (VI) where R6 is other than H, and m = 0 can then be acylated as indicated above for compounds of the formula (V) by known methods to give compounds of the formula (I).<br><br>
Compounds of the formula (VII) where A, X, and R1 are as defined for formula (I) and L is a leaving group such as halogen or pseudohalogen or is a substitutable heteroaryloxy group A-X can be reacted with unsubstituted or substituted alkyl cyanoacetates of the formula (VIII). R2 as being defined for formula (I), preferably using (CrC6)alkyl esters (ref,: N. Desideri; F. Manna, J. Heterocycl Chem., 25 (1), 333-335, 1988).<br>
The ester groups of the compounds of the formula (IX) can then be converted into the free carboxylic acids. This can be done, for example, by basic hydrolysis of the alkyl esters or else may be carried out under acidic hydrolysis conditions, with the<br><br>
carboxylic acid groups subsequently being decarboxylated under, for example, acidic conditions to give compounds of the formula (X) (ref.: N. Desideri; F, Manna, J. Heterocycl. Chem.. 25 (1),333 - 335.1988). In formula (X) A. X. R1 and R2 have the definition indicated for formula (I).<br>
The cyano compounds of the formula (X) that are obtainable in this way can be converted into the corresponding amino compounds of the formula (XI) by means of suitable reduction methods, as already described for the preparation of the amines of the formula (V) from the nitriles of the formula (III). The amines of the formula (XI) that are obtainable in this way can be reacted in analogy to the amines of the formula (V) to give compounds of the formula (I) in which A, X, R1 R2, R6, and B are as defined for formula (I).<br>
Banks of compounds of the formula (I) and salts thereof which can be synthesized in accordance with the schemes indicated above may also be prepared in a parallelized way, which can be implemented manually, with partial automation or with full automation. It is possible, for example, to automate the implementation of the reaction, the workup, or the purification of the products and/or intermediates. By an automated synthesis of this kind is meant, overall, a procedure such as is described, for example, by S.H. DeWitt in "Annual Reports in Combinatorial Chemistry and Molecular Diversity; Automated Synthesis", volume 1, Escom 1997, pages 69 to 77.<br>
For parallelized reaction implementation and workup it is possible to use a range of commercially available instruments, such as those offered, for example, by Stem Corporation, Woodrolfe Road, Tollesbury, Essex, England, H+P Labortechnik GmbH, Bruckmannring 28, 85764 Oberschieiliheim, Germany or Radleys, Shire Hill, Saffron Walden, Essex, CB 11 :3AZ, England. For the parallelized purification of compounds of the formula (I) and salts thereof and/or of intermediates resulting during the production, chromatography apparatus, inter alia, is available, for example, from ISCO Inc., 4700 Superior Street, Lincoln, NE 68504, USA. The apparatus listed leads to a modular procedure in which the individual worksteps<br><br>
are automated although it is necessary to carry out manual operations between the worksteps. This can be avoided by using partly or fully integrated automation systems where the respective automation modules are operated, for example, by robots. Automation systems of this kind can be purchased, for example, from Zymark Corporation, Zymark Center, Hopkinton, MA 01748, USA.<br>
In addition to the methods described here, compounds of the formula (I) and salts thereof can be prepared completely or partly by means of solid-phase-aided methods. For this purpose, some or all of the synthesis intermediates or the intermediates of a synthesis adapted to suit the procedure in question are bound to a synthetic resin. Solid-phase-aided synthesis methods are described extensively in the specialist literature, for example, by Barry A. Bunin in "The Combinatorial Index", Academic Press, 1998.<br>
The use of solid-phase-aided synthesis methods allows a series of protocols known from the literature, which in turn can be carried out manually or in automated fashion. For example, the teabag method (Houghten, US 4,631,211; Houghten et a!,, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, 1985, 82, 5131-5135) can be partly automated with products from IRORI, 11149 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA. Solid-phase-aided parallel syntheses are successfully automated, for example, by means of apparatus from Argonaut Technologies Inc., 887 Industrial Road, San Carlos, CA 94070, USA or MultiSynTech GmbH. Wullener Feld 4. 58454 Witten, Germany. Preparation in accordance with the processes described herein provides compounds of the formula (I) and salts thereof in the form of banks of substances which are referred to as libraries. The present invention further provides libraries comprising at least two compounds of the formula (I) and salts thereof.<br>
The inventive compounds of the formula (I) and their salts, referred to collectively below as compounds of the formula (I) (of the invention), exhibit an excellent herbicidal activity against a broad spectrum of economically important monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous weed plants. Even perennial weeds which are difficult to control and which produce shoots from rhizomes, rootstocks or other<br><br>
perennial organs are effectively controlled by the compounds of the invention. The compounds of the invention can be applied, for example, pre-sowing. pre-emergence or post-emergence. Specific examples may be given of some representatives of the monocot and dicot weed flora which can be controlled by the compounds of the invention, without such naming being intended to represent any restriction to specific species.<br>
On the side of the monocot weed species, for example, Avena, Lolium. Alopecurus, Phalaris, Echinochloa, Digitaria, Setaria, and also Bromus species and Cyperus species, from the annual group, and Agropyron, Cynodon, Imperata, and Sorghum, and also perennial Cyperus species, on the side of the perennial species, are effectively controlled.<br>
In the case of dicot weed species, the activity spectrum extends to species such as. for example, Galium, Viola, Veronica, Lamium, Stellaria, Amaranthus, Sinapis, Ipomoea, Matricaria, Abutilon, and Sida, on the annual side, and also Convolvulus, Cirsium, Rumex and Artemisia among the perennial weeds. Weed plants which occur under the specific growing conditions in rice, such as Echinochloa, Sagittaria. Alisma, Eleocharis, Scirpus, and Cyperus, for example, are likewise controlled to outstanding effect by the compounds of the invention.<br>
Where the compounds of the invention are applied to the soil surface prior to germination, then either the weed seedlings are prevented completely from emerging or else the weeds grow until they reach the cotyledon stage but then their growth stops and eventually, after three to four weeks have elapsed, they die off completely.<br>
Where the compounds of the invention are applied post-emergence to the green parts of the plants, growth also stops sharply a very short time after treatment, and the weed plants remain at the developmental stage they were in at the time of application, or they die off completely after a certain time, so that weed competition, which is harmful for the crop plants, is eliminated sustainedly and at a very early stage.<br><br>
Although the compounds of the invention exhibit an excellent herbicidai activity against monocot and dicot weeds, there is negligible if any damage to plants of economically important crops, examples including dicotyledonous crops such as soya, cotton, oilseed rape, sugar beet, especially soya, or gramineous crops such as wheat, barley, rye, rice or corn. For these reasons, the present compounds are highly suitable for selectively controlling unwanted plant growth in plantings of agricultural crops or decorative plants.<br>
In addition, the compounds of the invention have outstanding growth-regulating properties in crop plants. They engage in the plant metabolism in a regulating manner and can thus be employed for the targeted control of plant constituents and for facilitating harvesting, such as for example by provoking desiccation and stunted growth. Furthermore, they are also suitable for generally regulating and inhibiting undesirable vegetative growth, without destroying the plants in the process. Inhibition of vegetative growth plays an important role in many monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous crops because lodging can be reduced thereby or prevented completely. Owing to their herbicidai and plant growth regulatory properties, the active compounds can also be employed for controlling harmful plants in crops of known or still to be developed genetically engineered plants. The transgenic plants generally have particular advantageous properties, for example resistance to certain pesticides, in particular certain herbicides, resistance to plant diseases or causative organisms of plant diseases, such as certain insects or microorganisms such as fungi, bacteria or viruses. Other particular properties relate, for example, to the quantity, quality, storage stability, composition and to specific ingredients of the harvested product. Thus, transgenic plants having an increased starch content or a modified quality of the starch or those having a different fatty acid composition of the harvested product are known.<br>
) The use of the compounds of the formula (I) according to the invention or their salts in economically important transgenic crops of useful and ornamental plants, for example of cereals, such as wheat, barley, rye, oats, millet, rice, manioc and corn, or<br><br>
else in crops of sugar beet, cotton, soy, oilseed rape, potato, tomato, pea and other vegetable species is preferred.<br>
The compounds of the formula (I) can preferably be used as herbicides in crops of useful plants which are resistant or which have been made resistant by genetic engineering toward the phytotoxic effects of the herbicides.<br>
Conventional ways of preparing novel plants which have modified properties compared to known plants comprise, for example, traditional breeding methods and the generation of mutants. Alternatively, novel plants having modified properties can be produced with the aid of genetic engineering methods (see, for example, EP-A-0221044, EP-A-0131624). For example, there have been described several cases of<br>
genetically engineered changes In crop plants in order to modify the starch<br>
synthesized in the plants (for example WO 92/11376, WO 92/14827 and<br>
WO 91/19806),<br>
transgenic crop plants which are resistant to certain herbicides of the<br>
glufosinate type (cf., for example, EP-A-0242236, EP-A'0242246) or<br>
glyphosate type (WO 92/00377), or of the sulfonylurea type (EP-A-0257993,<br>
US-A-5013659),<br>
transgenic crop plants, for example cotton, having the ability to produce<br>
Bacillus thuringiensis toxins (Bt toxins) which impart resistance to certain<br>
pests to the plants (EP-A-0142924, EP-A-0193259),<br>
transgenic   crop    plants    having   a    modified   fatty   acid    composition<br>
(WO 91/13972).<br>
Numerous molecular biological techniques which allow the preparation of novel transgenic plants having modified properties are known in principle; see, for example, Sambrook et al., 1989, Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY; or Winnacker "Gene und Klone" [Genes and Clones], VCH Weinheim, 2nd edition 1996, or Christou, "Trends in Plant Science" 1 (1996) 423-431). In order to carry out such genetic engineering manipulations, it is possible to<br><br>
introduce nucleic acid molecules into plasmids which allow a mutagenesis or a change in the sequence to occur by recombination of DNA sequences. Using the abovementioned standard processes it is possible, for example, to exchange bases, to remove partial sequences or to add natural or synthetic sequences. To link the DNA fragments with each other, it is possible to attach adaptors or linkers to the fragments.<br>
Plant cells having a reduced activity of a gene product can be prepared, for example, by expressing at least one appropriate antisense-RNA, a sense-RNA to achieve a cosuppression effect, or by expressing at least one appropriately constructed ribozyme which specifically cleaves transcripts of the abovementioned gene product.<br>
To this end, it is possible to employ both DNA molecules which comprise the entire coding sequence of a gene product, including any flanking sequences that may be present, and DNA molecules which comprise only parts of the coding sequence, it being necessary for these parts to be long enough to cause an antisense effect in the cells. It is also possible to use DNA sequences which have a high degree of homology to the coding sequences of a gene product but which are not entirely identical.<br>
When expressing nucleic acid molecules in plants, the synthesized protein can be localized in any desired compartment of the plant cell. However, to achieve localization in a certain compartment, it is, for example, possible to link the coding region with DNA sequences which ensure localization in a certain compartment. Such sequences are known to the person skilled in the art (see, for example, Braun et al., EMBO J. 11 (1992), 3219-3227; Wolter et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85 (1988), 846-850; Sonnewald et al.. Plant J. 1 (1991), 95-106).<br>
The transgenic plant cells can be regenerated to whole plants using known techniques. The transgenic plants can in principle be plants of any desired plant species, i.e, both monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants.<br><br>
In this manner, it is possible to obtain transgenic plants which have modified properties by overexpression, suppression or inhibition of homologous (= natural) genes or gene sequences or by expression of heterologous (= foreign) genes or gene sequences.<br>
The compounds (I) according to the invention can preferably be used in transgenic crops which are resistant to herbicides selected from the group consisting of the sulfonylureas, glufosinate-ammonium or glyphosate-isopropylammonium and analogous active compounds.<br>
When using the active compounds according to the invention in transgenic crops, in addition to the effects against harmful plants which can be observed in other crops, there are frequently effects which are specific for the application in the respective transgenic crop, for example a modified or specifically broadened spectrum of weeds which can be controlled, modified application rates which can be used for the application, preferably good combinability with the herbicides to which the transgenic crop is resistant, and an effect on the growth and the yield of the transgenic crop plants.<br>
The invention therefore also provides for the use of the compounds (!) according to the invention as herbicides for controlling weed plants in transgenic crop plants.<br>
The compounds according to the invention can be applied in the customary formulations in the form of wettable powders, emulsifiable concentrates, sprayable solutions, dusts or granules. The invention therefore also provides herbicidal and plant-growth-regulating compositions comprising compounds of the formula (I).<br>
The compounds of the formula (I) can be formulated in various ways depending on I the prevailing biological and/or chemico-physical parameters. Examples of suitable formulation options are: wettable powders (WP). water-soluble powders (SP), water-soluble concentrates, emulsifiable concentrates (EC), emulsions (EW), such as oil-<br><br>
n-water and water-in-oil emulsions, sprayable solutions, suspension concentrates [SC), oil- or water-based dispersions, oil-miscible solutions, capsule suspensions [CS), dusts (DP), seed-dressing compositions, granules for broadcasting and soil application, granules (GR) in the form of microgranules, spray granules, coating granules and adsorption granules, water-dispersible granules (WG), water-soluble granules (SG), ULV formulations, microcapsules and waxes. These individual formulation types are known in principle and are described, for example, in Winnacker-Kuchler. "Chemische Technologie" [Chemical Technology], Volume 7. C. Hauser Verlag Munich, 4th edition 1986; Wade van Valkenburg. "Pesticide Formulations", Marcel Dekker, N.Y., 1973; K, Martens, "Spray Drying" Handbook, 3rd ed, 1979, G, Goodwin Ltd, London.<br>
The necessary formulation auxiliaries, such as inert materials, surfactants, solvents and other additives, are likewise known and are described, for example, in: Watkins, "Handbook of Insecticide Dust Diluents and Carriers", 2nd ed,, Dariand Books, Caldwell N.J„ H.v, Olphen, "Introduction to Clay Colloid Chemistry"; 2nd ed„ J. Wiley &amp; Sons, N.Y,; C. Marsden, "Solvents Guide"; 2nd ed., Interscience, N.Y. 1963; McCutcheon's "Detergents and Emulsifiers Annual", MC Publ, Corp., Ridgewood N.J.; Sisley and Wood, "Encyclopedia of Surface Active Agents", Chem. Publ. Co. Inc., N.Y. 1964; Schonfeldt, "Grenzflachenaktive Athylenoxidaddukte" [Suri'ace-active ethylene oxide adducts], Wiss. Veriagsgesell., Stuttgart 1976; Winnacker-Kuchler, "Chemische Technologie" [Chemical Technology], Volume 7, C. Hauser Verlag Munich, 4th edition 1986.<br>
Based on these formulations it is also possible to produce combinations with other pesticidally active substances, for example insecticides, acaricides, herbicides and fungicides, and also with safeners, fertilizers and/or growth regulators, for example in the form of a ready-mix or tank mix.<br>
Wettable powders are preparations which are uniformly dispersible in water and which, in addition to the active compound and as well as a diluent or inert substance, also contain surfactants of ionic and/or nonionic type (wetting agents,<br><br>
dispersants). for example polyethoxylated alkyl phenols, polyethoxylated fatty alcohols, polyethoxylated fatty amines, fatty alcohol polyglycol ether sulfates, alkanesulfonates, alkylbenzenesulfonates, sodium ligninsulfonate, sodium 2,2'-dinaphthylmethane-6.6'-disulfonate, sodium dibutylnaphthalenesulfonate or else sodium oleoylmethyltaurinate. To prepare the wettable powders, the herbicidally active compounds are finely ground, for example in customary apparatuses such as hammer mills, fan mills and air-jet mills, and are mixed simultaneously or subsequently with the formulation auxiliaries,<br>
Emulsifiable concentrates are prepared by dissolving the active compound in an organic solvent, for example butanol, cyclohexanone, dimethylformamide, xylene or else relatively high-boiling aromatics or hydrocarbons or mixtures of the organic solvents, with the addition of one or more surfactants of ionic and/or nonionic type (emulsifiers). Examples of emulsifiers which can be used are calcium alkylarylsulfonates, such as Ca dodecylbenzenesulfonate, or nonionic emulsifiers, such as fatty acid polyglycol esters, alkylaryl polyglycol ethers, fatty alcohol polyglycol ethers, propylene oxide-ethylene oxide condensation products, alkyl poiyethers, sorbitan esters, for example sorbitan fatty acid esters or poiyoxyethylene sorbitan esters, for example poiyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters.<br>
Dusts are obtained by grinding the active compound with finely divided solid substances, for example talc, natural clays, such as kaolin, bentonite and pyrophyllite, ordiatomaceous earth.<br>
Suspension concentrates can be water- or oil-based. They can be prepared, for example, by wet milling using commercially customary bead mills, with or without the addition of surfactants as already mentioned above, for example, in the case of the other formulation types.<br>
Emulsions, for example oil-in-water emulsions (EW), can be prepared for example by means of stirrers, colloid mills and/or static mixers using aqueous organic solvents and, if desired, surfactants as already mentioned above, for example, in the<br><br>
case of the other formulation types.<br>
Granules can be prepared either by spraying the active compound onto adsorptive, granulated inert material or by applying active-compound concentrates to the surface of carriers such as sand, kaolinites or granulated inert material, by means of adhesive binders, for example polyvinyl alcohol, sodium polyacrylate or else mineral oils. Suitable active compounds can also be granulated in the manner which is customary for the preparation of fertilizer granules, if desired as a mixture with fertilizers,<br>
Water-dispersible granules are generally prepared by the customary processes, such as spray-drying, fluidized-bed granulation, disk granulation, mixing using high¬speed mixers, and extrusion without solid inert material.<br>
For the preparation of disk, fluidized-bed, extnjder and spray granules, see for example processes in "Spray-Drying Handbook" 3rd ed, 1979, G. Goodwin Ltd,, London; J.E, Browning, "Agglomeration", Chemical and Engineering 1967, pages 147 ff; "Perry's Chemical Engineer's Handbook", 5th ed., McGraw-Hill, New York 1973, pp. 8-57,<br>
For further details on the formulation of crop protection products, see for example G.C. Klingman, "Weed Control as a Science", John Wiley and Sons., Inc., New York, 1961, pages 81-96 and J.D. Freyer, S.A. Evans, "Weed Control Handbook", 5th ed., Blackwell Scientific Publications, Oxford, 1968. pages 101-103. The agrochemical formulations generally contain from 0.1 to 99% by weight, in particular from 0.1 to 95% by weight, of active compound of the formula (I) and/or salts thereof.<br>
In wettable powders the concentration of active compound is, for example, from about 10 to 90% by weight, the remainder to 100% by weight consisting of customary formulation constituents. In emulsifiable concentrates the concentration of active compound can be from about 1 to 90%, preferably from 5 to 80%, by weight. Formulations in the form of dusts contain from 1 to 30% by weight of active<br><br>

The active compounds of the invention can also be used in combination with safeners. For use, the formulations which are present in commercially available form are, if appropriate, diluted in the customary manner, for example using water in the case of wettable powders, emulsifiable concentrates, dispersions and water-dispersible granules. Preparations in the form of dusts, granules for soil application or broadcasting and sprayable solutions are usually not further diluted with other inert substances prior to use.<br>
The required application rate of the compounds of the formula (I) varies with the external conditions, such as temperature, humidity, the nature of the herbicide used and the like. It can vary within wide limits, for example between 0.001 and 10.0 kg/ha or more of active substance, but it is preferably between 0.005 and 5 kg/ha.<br><br>

Seeds or rhizome pieces of mono- and dicotyledonous weed plants were placed in sandy loam soil in plastic pots and covered with soil. The compounds according to the invention, formulated in the form of wettable powders or emulsion concentrates, were then applied to the soil cover in the form of aqueous suspensions or emulsions at an application rate of 600 to 800 I of water/ha (converted), in various dosages. After the treatment, the pots were placed in a greenhouse and kept under good growth conditions for the weeds. After the test plants had emerged, the damage to the plants or the negative effect on the emergence was visually scored after a test period of 3 to 4 weeks by comparison with untreated controls. As shown by the test results, the compounds according to the invention have good herbicidal pre-emergence activity against a broad spectrum of weed grasses and broad-leaved weeds* For example, the compounds of examples Nos.  4, 5, 10, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 34, 66, 78, 79, 134, 147, 148, 149, 150, 153, 155, 157, 159, 261, 275, 276, 279, 281, 283, 284, 285, 286, 287, 533, 539, 541, 542, 543, 544, 545, 546, 549 and other compounds from table 1 have very good herbicidal activity pre-emergence against weed plants such as Sinapis alba. Chrysanthemum segetum, Avena sativa, Stellaria media, Echinochloa crus-galli, Lolium multiflorum, Setaria spp., Abutilon theophrasti, Amaranthus retroflexus and Panicum miliaceum at an application rate of 1 kg or less of active substance per hectare.<br>
2.	Post-emergence effect on weeds<br>
Seeds or rhizome pieces of mono- and dicotyledonous weeds were placed in sandy loam soil in plastic pots, covered with soil and grown in a greenhouse under good growth conditions. Three weeks after sowing, the test plants were treated at the<br><br>
three-leaf stage. The compounds according to the invention, formulated as wettable powders or emulsion concentrates, were sprayed, at various dosages, onto the green parts of the plants at an application rate of 600 to 800 I of water/ha (converted). After the test plants had remained in the greenhouse for about 3 to 4 weeks under optimum growth conditions, the effect of the preparations was scored visually by comparison with untreated controls. The agents according to the invention also have good herbicidal activity post-emergence against a broad spectrum of economically Important weed grasses and broad-leaved weeds. For example, the compounds of Example Nos. 4, 5. 10.18, 19, 20. 21, 22, 24. 25. 26, 27, 28. 29, 30, 31, 34. 66. 78, 79. 134. 147, 148. 149. 150, 153, 155, 157. 159. 261, 275, 276. 279, 281, 283. 284, 285. 286. 287, 533. 539. 541, 542, 543, 544. 545. 546, 549 and other compounds from table 1 have very good herbicidal activity post-emergence against weed plants such as Sinapis alba, Echinochloa crus-galli, Lolium multiflorum. Chrysanthemum segetum, Setaria spp., Abutilon theophrasti, Amaranthus retroflexus. Panicum miliaceum and Avena sativa at an application rate of 1 kg or less of active substance per hectare,<br>
3. Tolerance by crop plants<br>
In further greenhouse experiments, seeds of a substantial number of crop plants and weeds were placed in sandy loam soil and covered with soil. Some of the pots were treated immediately as described under section 1, and the remaining pots were placed in the greenhouse until the plants have developed two to three true leaves and then sprayed with various dosages of the substances of the formula (I) according to the invention, as described under section 2, Visual scoring four to five weeks after the application and after the plants had been in the greenhouse revealed that the compounds according to the invention leave dicotyledonous crops such as soy, cotton, oilseed rape, sugar beet and potatoes unharmed even when high dosages of active ingredient were used pre- and post-emergence. Moreover, some substances also spared gramineous crops such as barley, wheat, rye. sorghum, corn or rice. Some of the compounds of the formula (I) have high<br><br>
selectivity, and they are therefore suitable for controlling unwanted plant growth in agricultural crops.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
