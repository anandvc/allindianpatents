BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The field of the invention is the synthesis of transportation fuel from carbonaceous feed<br>
stocks. In particular, the invention relates to process and apparatus for converting<br>
carbonaceous material to energetic gases.<br>
Description of Related Art<br>
There is a need to identify new sources of chemical energy and methods for its conversion<br>
into alternative transportation fuels, driven by many concerns including environmental,<br>
health, safety issues, and the inevitable future scarcity of petroleum-based fuel supplies.<br>
The number of internal combustion engine fueled vehicles worldwide continues to grow,<br>
particularly in the midrange of developing countries. The worldwide vehicle population<br>
outside the U.S., which mainly uses diesel fuel, is growing faster than inside the U.S. This<br>
situation may change as more fuel-efficient vehicles, using hybrid and/or diesel engine<br>
technologies, are introduced to reduce both fuel consumption and overall emissions. Since<br>
the resources for the production of petroleum-based fuels are being depleted, dependency<br>
on petroleum will become a major problem unless non-petroleum alternative fuels, in<br>
particular clean-burning synthetic diesel fuels, are developed. Moreover, normal<br>
combustion of petroleum-based fuels in conventional engines can cause serious<br>
environmental pollution unless strict methods of exhaust emission<br><br><br>
control are used. A clean burning synthetic diesel fuel can help reduce the<br>
emissions from diesel engines.<br>
The production of clean-burning transportation fuels requires either<br>
the reformulation of existing petroleum-based fuels or the discovery of new<br>
methods for power production or fuel synthesis from unused materials. There<br>
are many sources available, derived from either renewable organic or waste<br>
carbonaceous materials. Utilizing carbonaceous waste to produce synthetic<br>
fuels is an economically viable method since the input feed stock is already<br>
considered of little value, discarded as waste, and disposal is often polluting.<br>
Liquid transportation fuels have inherent advantages over gaseous<br>
fuels, having higher energy densities than gaseous fuels at the same pressure<br>
and temperature. Liquid fuels can be stored at atmospheric or low pressures<br>
whereas to achieve liquid fuel energy densities, a gaseous fuel would have to<br>
be stored in a tank on a vehicle at high pressures that can be a safety<br>
concern in the case of leaks or sudden rupture. The distribution of liquid fuels<br>
is much easier than gaseous fuels, using simple pumps and pipelines. The<br>
liquid fueling infrastructure of the existing transportation sector ensures easy<br>
integration into the existing market of any production of clean-burning<br>
synthetic liquid transportation fuels.<br>
The availability of clean-burning liquid transportation fuels is a<br>
national priority. Producing synthesis gases cieanly and efficiently from<br>
carbonaceous sources, that can be subjected to a Fischer-Tropsch process to<br>
produce clean and valuable synthetic gasoline and diesel fuels, will benefit<br>
both the transportation sector and the health of society. Such a process<br>
allows for the application of current state-of-art engine exhaust after-treatment<br>
methods for NOx reduction, removal of toxic particulates present in diesel<br>
engine exhaust, and the reduction of normal combustion product pollutants,<br>
current\y accomplished by catalysts that are poisoned quickly by any sulfur<br>
present, as is the case in ordinary stocks of petroleum derived diesel fuel,<br>
reducing the catalyst efficiency. Typically, Fischer-Tropsch liquid fueis,<br><br><br>
produced from biomass derived synthesis gases, are sulfur-free, aromatic<br>
free, and in the case of synthetic diesel fuel have an ultrahigh cetane value.<br>
Biomass material is the most commonly processed carbonaceous<br>
waste feed stock used to produce renewable fuels. Waste plastic, rubber,<br>
manure, crop residues, forestry, tree and grass cuttings and biosolids from<br>
waste water (sewage) treatment are also candidate feed stocks for conversion<br>
processes. Biomass feed stocks can be converted to produce electricity,<br>
heat, valuable chemicals or fuels. California tops the nation in the use and<br>
development of several biomass utilization technologies. Each year in<br>
California, more than 45 million tons of municipal solid waste is discarded for<br>
treatment by waste management facilities. Approximately half this waste<br>
ends up in landfills. For example, in just the Riverside County, California<br>
area, it is estimated that about 4000 tons of waste wood are disposed of per<br>
day. According to other estimates, over 100,000 tons of biomass per day are<br>
dumped into landfills in the Riverside County collection area. This municipal<br>
waste comprises about 30% waste paper or cardboard, 40% organic (green<br>
and food) waste, and 30% combinations of wood, paper, plastic and metal<br>
waste. The carbonaceous components of this waste material have chemical<br>
energy that could be used to reduce the need for other energy sources if it<br>
can be converted into a clean-burning fuel. These waste sources of<br>
carbonaceous material are not the only sources available. While many<br>
existing carbonaceous waste materials, such as paper, can be sorted, reused<br>
and recycled, for other materials, the waste producer would not need to pay a<br>
tipping fee, if the waste were to be delivered directly to a conversion facility. A<br>
tipping fee, presently at $30-$35 per ton, is usually charged by the waste<br>
management agency to offset disposal costs. Consequently not only can<br>
disposal costs be reduced by transporting the waste to a waste-to-synthetic<br>
fuels processing plant, but additional waste would be made available because<br>
of the lowered cost of disposal.<br><br><br>
The burning of wood in a wood stove is an example of using<br>
biomass to produce heat energy. Unfortunately, the open burning the<br>
biomass waste to obtain energy and heat is not a clean and efficient method<br>
to utilize the calorific value. Today, many new ways of utilizing carbonaceous<br>
waste are being discovered. For example, one way is to produce synthetic<br>
liquid transportation fuels, and another way is to produce energetic gases for<br>
conversion into electricity.<br>
Using fuels from renewable biomass sources can actually decrease<br>
the net accumulation of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, while<br>
providing clean, efficient energy for transportation. One of the principal<br>
benefits of co-production of synthetic liquid fuels from biomass sources is that<br>
it can provide a storable transportation fuel while reducing the effects of<br>
greenhouse gases contributing to global warming. In the future, these<br>
co-production processes could provide clean-burning fuels for a renewable<br>
fuel economy that could be sustained continuously.<br>
A number of processes exist to convert coal and other<br>
carbonaceous materials to clean-burning transportation fuels, but they tend to<br>
be too expensive to compete on the market with petroleum-based fuels, or<br>
they produce volatile fuels, such as methanol and ethanol that have vapor<br>
pressure values too high for use in high pollution areas, such as the Southern<br>
California air-basin, without legislative exemption from clean air regulations.<br>
An example of the latter process is the Hynol Methanol Process, which uses<br>
hydro-gasification and steam reformer reactors to synthesize methanol using<br>
a co-feed of solid carbonaceous materials and natural gas, and which has a<br>
demonstrated carbon conversion efficiency of &gt;85% in bench-scale<br>
demonstrations.<br>
The need to identify new resources and methods for the production<br>
of transportation fuels requires not only investigating improvements in ways to<br>
produce current petroleum-based fuels but also research into new methods<br>
for the synthesis of functionally equivalent alternative fuels obtained using<br><br><br>
resources and methods that are not in use today. The production of synthetic<br>
liquid fuels from carbonaceous materials such as waste organic materials is<br>
one way to solve these problems. The utilization of carbonaceous waste<br>
materials to produce synthetic fuels can be considered a feasible method of<br>
obtaining new resources for fuel production since the material feed stock is<br>
already considered a waste, without value and often it's disposal creates<br>
additional sources of environmental pollution.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention makes use of steam pyrolysis, hydro-<br>
gasification and steam reformation to produce a synthesis gas that can be<br>
converted into a synthetic paraffinic fuel, preferably a diesel fuel, although<br>
synthetic gasolines and jet propulsion fuels can also be made, using a<br>
Fischer-Tropsch paraffin fuel synthesis reactor. Alternatively, the synthesis<br>
gas may be used in a co-generated power conversion and process heat<br>
system. The present invention provides comprehensive equilibrium thermo-<br>
chemical analyses for a general class of co-production processes for the<br>
synthesis of clean-burning liquid transportation fuels, thermal process energy<br>
and electric power generation from feeds of coal, or other carbonaceous<br>
materials, and liquid water. It enables a unique design, efficiency of operation<br>
and comprehensive analysis of coal, or any other carbonaceous feed<br>
materials to co-produced fuel, power and heat systems.<br>
In one embodiment, the invention provides separate steam<br>
pyrolysis, hydro-gasification, and steam reformer reactors in a process for<br>
producing a synthesis gas for use as a gaseous fuel or as feed into a Fischer-<br>
Tropsch reactor to produce a liquid paraffinic fuel, recycled water and sensible<br>
heat, in a substantially self-sustaining process. A slurry of particles of<br>
carbonaceous material suspended in liquid water, and hydrogen from an<br>
internal source, are fed into a steam generator for pyrolysis and hydro-<br>
gasification reactor under conditions whereby super-heated steam, methane,<br>
carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide are generated and fed into a steam<br><br><br>
reformer under conditions whereby synthesis gas comprising primarily of<br>
hydrogen and carbon monoxide are generated. Using a hydrogen separation<br>
filter for purification, a portion of the hydrogen generated by the steam<br>
reformer is fed into the hydro-gasification reactor as the hydrogen from an<br>
internal source. The remaining synthesis gas generated by the steam<br>
reformer is either used as fuel for a gaseous fueled engine or gas turbine to<br>
produce electricity and process heat, or is fed into a Fischer-Tropsch fuel<br>
synthesis reactor under conditions to produce a liquid fuel, and recycled<br>
water. The correct stoichiometric ratio of hydrogen to carbon monoxide<br>
molecules fed into the Fischer-Tropsch fuel synthesis reactor, is controlled by<br>
the water to carbon ratio in the feed stocks. Molten salt loops are used to<br>
transfer heat from the exothermic hydro-gasification reactor (and from the<br>
exothermic Fischer-Tropsch reactor if liquid fuel is produced) to the<br>
endothermic steam generator for pyrolysis and the steam reformer reactor<br>
vessels.<br>
In particular, this embodiment provides the following features.<br>
1)	A general purpose solid carbonaceous material feed system that<br>
can accept arbitrary combinations of coal, urban and agricultural biomass,<br>
and municipal solid waste for hydro-gasification.<br>
2)	A first stage, steam generator for pyrolysis and hydro-<br>
gasification unit.<br>
3)	A steam reformer as a second stage reactor to produce<br>
hydrogen rich synthesis gas from the output of the first stage steam generator<br>
for pyrolysis and hydro-gasification unit. The molal steam to carbon ratio is<br>
maintained as necessary to bring the chemical reactions close to equilibrium;<br>
4)	Either (a) a Fischer-Tropsch (synthesis gas-to-liquid) fuel<br>
synthesizer as a third and final stage reactor to convert the synthesis gas from<br>
the steam reformer into a sulfur-free clean-burning liquid transportation fuel,<br><br><br>
and recycled water or (b) use of generated synthesis gas as fuel for process<br>
heat and/or in a fuel engine or gas turbine that can generate electricity;<br>
5) Three thermo-chemical process reactors are operated to<br>
produce nearly pure paraffinic hydrocarbon liquids (similar to petroleum<br>
derived diesel fuels) and wax-like compounds (similar to petroleum derived<br>
USP paraffinic jellies, which can be further refined into more diesel-like fuels<br>
using conventional methods) from carbonaceous feed stocks (such as waste<br>
wood) in a continuous self-sustainable fashion without the need for additional<br>
fuels or external energy sources. The reactor configurations can also be<br>
optimized for the production of other synthetic fuels, such as dimethyl ether (a<br>
fuel similar to propane, that can be used as a transportation fuel in diesel<br>
engines and gas turbines) and gaseous fuel grade hydrogen (a fuel that can<br>
be used in engines and turbines, and if purified to remove carbon monoxide,<br>
as an electrochemical fuel in a fuel cell), as well as energetic synthesis gases<br>
for combined cycle power conversion and electric power production.<br>
In another embodiment, a process is provided for converting<br>
carbonaceous material to energetic gases by combining two separate<br>
processes, steam pyrolysis and hydro-gasification, into a single step. The<br>
process involves simultaneously heating carbonaceous material in the<br>
presence of both hydrogen and steam at a temperature and pressure<br>
sufficient to generate methane and carbon monoxide rich producer gases.<br>
The process can be carried out on biomass, municipal waste, wood, synthetic<br>
and natural polymers such as plastics and rubbers, and other carbonaceous<br>
materials.<br>
One of the advantages of combining steam pyrolysis and<br>
hydro-gasification into a single step is the production of hydrocarbon gases<br>
from carbonaceous material at rates much greater than the rates achievable<br>
by hydro-gasification alone. Another advantage is the use of more compact<br>
hydro-gasification reactors, with shorter residence times, than systems<br>
without steam pyrolysis.<br><br><br>
The fundamental advantages of this invention, over what was<br>
achievable with the prior art, are: (a) energy efficient (&gt;85%) methane<br>
production from the available carbon in the carbonaceous feed stock using<br>
steam pyrolysis to activate the carbon and hydrogen gas as the sole initiating<br>
reactant, in contradistinction to partial oxidative gasification usually requiring<br>
an additional energy intensive air separation system to provide the necessary<br>
oxygen; (b) chemically self-sustained operation of the first stage hydro-<br>
gasification reactor by feeding-back surplus hydrogen gas produced in the<br>
second stage methane steam reformer reactor; (c) energy efficient synthesis<br>
of clean-burning transportation fuels using the effluent gases from the steam<br>
reformer, such as: (i) paraffinic compounds using a third stage Fischer-<br>
Tropsch fuel synthesis reactor, (ii) dimethyl ether synthesis using a third stage<br>
synthesis reactor, and (iii) hydrogen production using a hydrogen separation<br>
and/or purification filter without the need for a third stage fuel synthesis<br>
reactor; (d) thermally self-sustained operation of all reactors by effective<br>
management of thermal and chemical energy using combinations of molten<br>
salt or water/steam heat transfer fluids, combustion of product energetic<br>
gases to start and maintain process temperatures, recovered process heat for<br>
the generation of electric power, without the need for additional fuels and<br>
external energy sources; (e) significantly reduced airborne emissions from all<br>
enclosed processes reactors and/or synthesis gas combustors when<br>
compared to direct naturally aspirated combustion (usually known as open<br>
incineration) of the carbonaceous feed materials; and f) the ability to capture<br>
all gaseous carbon dioxide effluent from process reactors or intra-process<br>
synthesis gas combustors for sequestration and/or chemical conversion into<br>
condensed phase compounds using conventional technologies.<br>
These novel configurations of the process reactors have the<br>
capability to improve the overall efficiency of energy utilization for<br>
carbonaceous material conversion in a co-production plant for synthetic fuels,<br>
chemicals and energy.<br><br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, a steam generator for<br>
pyrolysis, hydro-gasification reactor (HGR) and steam pyrolytic reformer<br>
(SPR) (also called a steam pyrolytic reactor, steam reformer or steam reactor)<br>
such as used in a Hynol process, may be utilized to produce the synthesis<br>
gas (syngas) through steam pyrolysis of the feed stock, hydro-gasification and<br>
steam reforming reactions. The reactions start in the HGR to convert carbon<br>
in the carbonaceous matter into a methane rich producer gas and continue<br>
through the SPR to produce synthesis gas with the correct hydrogen and<br>
carbon monoxide stoichiometry for efficient operation of the Fischer-Tropsch<br>
process. With the Fischer-Tropsch process as the final step in processing,<br>
products such as synthetic gasoline, synthetic diesel fuel and recycled water<br>
can be produced.<br>
The feedstock requirement is highly flexible. Many feeds that<br>
consist of different carbonaceous materials can be wet milled to form a water<br>
slurry that can be fed at high pressure into a steam pyrolyzer, hydro-gasifier<br>
and steam reformer reactors for synthesis gas production. The feed to water<br>
mass ratio can even vary during the running of the process, with a knowledge<br>
of the chemical content of the feed, to maintain the carbon-hydrogen<br>
stiochiometry required for an optimized fuel synthesis process. Appropriate<br>
carbonaceous materials include biomass, natural gas, oil, petroleum coke,<br>
coal, petrochemical and refinery by-products and wastes, plastics, tires,<br>
sewage sludge and other organic wastes. For example, wood is an example<br>
of waste biomass material that is readily available in Riverside County,<br>
California. This particular waste stream could be augmented with other<br>
carbonaceous materials, such as green waste and biosolids from water<br>
treatment that are available in Riverside County, and would otherwise go to<br>
landfill.<br>
When used to make a transportation fuel, such as diesel fuel, the<br>
process is designed so that the feedstock makes the maximum amount of<br><br><br>
Fischer-Tropsch paraffinic product required. The desired output consists of a<br>
liquid hydrocarbon, such as cetane, C16H34, within the carbon number range,<br>
12 to 20, suitable as a diesel fuel. Excess synthesis gas output from the SPR,<br>
i.e., "leftover" chemical energy from the Fischer Tropsch synthetic fuel<br>
producing process, can be used as an energetic fuel to run a gas turbine for<br>
electricity production. The synthesis gas output after recycling enough<br>
hydrogen to sustain the hydro-gasifier, may be used for this purpose also,<br>
depending on the needs of the user. The following provides a method for<br>
maximizing the economic potential from the present invention in the<br>
conversion of carbonaceous materials to a usable transportation fuels and<br>
inclusive of the possibility for direct electric power production through a gas<br>
turbine combined cycle.<br>
1)	Find approximate data on available carbonaceous wastes, their<br>
chemical composition and perform further analysis on the practical need for<br>
the process.<br>
2)	Model the important reactions within the process consisting of<br>
the steam generator for pyrolysis, hydro-gasifier, steam reformer, and the<br>
Fischer-Tropsch (or other fuel synthesis) reactor on a continuous flow-through<br>
basis. This may be done by optimizing the Fischer-Tropsch (or other fuel<br>
synthesizer) feedstock for the optimum stoichiometric hydrogen to carbon<br>
monoxide mole ratio for fuel to be synthesized.<br>
3)	Perform an economic analysis on the costs to obtain and<br>
prepare the input material required, capital costs, operating and maintenance,<br>
and product yield and costs.<br>
Specific implementations are given below in conjunction with flow<br>
charts provided in the Figures, demonstrating the conversion of waste wood,<br>
as the candidate carbonaceous material, to a liquid diesel transportation fuel,<br>
recycled water and an alternative power source, via a Fischer-Tropsch<br>
process linked to a gas turbine combined cycle.<br><br><br>
The thermo-chemical conversion of carbonaceous materials occurs<br>
by two main processes: hydro-gasification and steam reformation, with steam<br>
pyrolysis of the feedstock occurring within the steam generator to pre-treat<br>
feedstock and activate the carbon contained therein. The hydro-gasifier<br>
requires an input of the pyrolyzed carbonaceous waste, hydrogen, steam,<br>
reacting in a vessel at high temperature and pressure, which in a specific<br>
implementation is approximately 30 atmospheres and 1000 degrees Celsius.<br>
Steam reforming of the methane rich effluent gas from the HGR also requires<br>
an approximate pressure of 30 atmospheres and 1000 degrees Celsius.<br>
More generally, each process can be conducted over a temperature range of<br>
about 700 to 1200 degrees Celsius and a pressure of about 20 to 50<br>
atmospheres. Lower temperatures and pressures can produce useful<br>
reaction rates with the use of appropriate reaction catalysts or steam pyrolysis<br>
processes. When combining steam pyrolysis and hydro-gasification in a<br>
common reactor vessel, the inventors have found that adequate reaction<br>
kinetics can be achieved at temperatures up to 750 degrees Celsius.<br>
Referring to Figure 1, which is an overall flow diagram, the order of<br>
general processes that carry out these main reaction processes is shown<br>
(specific amounts for a particular embodiment are in the flow diagrams shown<br>
in Figures 14 through 38). Piping is used to convey the materials through the<br>
process. The feed 11 is chopped, milled or ground in a grinder 10 into small<br>
particles, mixed with the recycled water 12 and placed in a receptacle or tank<br>
14 as a liquid, suspension slurry 16 that is transportable as a compressed<br>
fluid by a pump 18 to a steam generator 20 where the slurry 16 is<br>
superheated and pyrolyzed, followed by either separation of the steam in a<br>
steam separator 22 so that steam goes through piping 24 that is separate<br>
from piping that delivers the pumped, dense slurry paste 26, or a direct steam<br>
pyrolysis feed through piping 27.<br>
The dense slurry paste feed 26, or the direct steam pyrolysis feed<br>
27, enters the HGR 28. Hydrogen from an internal source (from the steam<br><br>
reformer via a hydrogen separation filter described below) and a fraction of<br>
the previously produced steam flow into the HGR 28 for the desired output.<br>
The output gases consists largely of methane, hydrogen, carbon monoxide,<br>
and super-heated steam. The gases produced by the HGR 28 leaves the<br>
chamber and is pumped over to the SPR 30. The un-reacted residue (or ash)<br>
from the HGR, is periodically removed from the bottom of the reactor vessel<br>
using a double buffered lock-hopper arrangement, that is commonly used in<br>
comparable high pressure gasification systems. The ash is expected to be<br>
comprised of sand, SiO2, and alumina, AI2O3, with trace amounts of metals.<br>
The input to the SPR 30 is delivered from either the steam separator 22 by<br>
piping 32 through a heater 34 and further piping 36, or via the HGR 28 output<br>
piping, to provide greater-than-theoretical steam to carbon ratio into the SPR<br>
30, to mitigate coking in the reactor. The output is a higher amount of<br>
hydrogen, and CO, with the appropriate stiochiometry for the desired<br>
hydrocarbon fuel synthesis process described below.<br>
The output of the SPR 30 is directed via piping 38 through heat<br>
exchangers 40 and 42. Condensed water 44 is separated and removed from<br>
the SPR output, via a heat exchanger and liquid water expander 47. The non-<br>
condensable gaseous output of SPR 30 is then conveyed to a hydrogen<br>
separation filter 46. A portion of the hydrogen from the SPR output, about<br>
one-half in this embodiment, is carried from the filter 46, passed through the<br>
heat exchanger 40 with a resultant rise in its temperature (in the embodiment<br>
from 220 degrees centigrade to 970 degrees Centigrade) and delivered to the<br>
HGR 28 as its hydrogen input. The hot effluent from the SPR output is cooled<br>
by passing through heat exchangers 40 and 42, used to heat the recycled<br>
hydrogen, and make steam respectively. The condensed water 44 leaving the<br>
heat exchanger 47 is recycled back to make the water supply 12 for the slurry<br>
feed. By such means, a self-sustaining process is obtained.<br>
The fuel synthesis gas is then used for one of two options. Based<br>
on the calorific value, the synthesis gas may go through a gas turbine<br><br><br>
combined cycle for direct energy production or through a fuel synthesis<br>
reactor (in this embodiment, a Fischer-Tropsch process to produce a clean<br>
diesel fuel and recycled water). In accordance with a specific embodiment of<br>
the invention, the synthesis gas is directed through an expansion turbine 48,<br>
to recover mechanical energy by lowering the pressure of the gaseous feed<br>
into the Fischer-Tropsch reactor 50. The mechanical power produced by the<br>
liquid state turbine, the Brayton and Rankine cycle turbines can be used to<br>
provide power for internal slurry, water feed pumps, air compressor, with the<br>
surplus exported via electricity generation, see Tables 1 through 7.<br>
Efficiency may be maximized by adjusting input and process<br>
parameters. The biomass/ coal varying-mixture feed is synthesized into a<br>
slurry by adding water whereby after steam separation the carbon to<br>
hydrogen ratio will be appropriate for the process. A slurry feed needs<br>
enough water to run the hydro-gasifier, the steam reformer, and to keep the<br>
feed in a viable slurry after steam separation. Prior art attempts at biomass<br>
conversion using solid dry feed had many mechanical problems of feeding a<br>
solid into the high pressure, and high temperature HGR reaction chamber.<br>
This method of slurry feed has already been demonstrated and studied,<br>
according to the results for the "Hydrothermal Treatment of Municipal Solid<br>
Waste to Form High Solids Slurries in a Pilot Scale System", by C. B.<br>
Thorsness et al., UCRL-ID 119685, published by Lawrence Livermore Nation<br>
Laboratory, Livermore, CA in 1995. In addition, there is related art published<br>
on the making and operating of coal water slurry feeds. For example, see Z.<br>
Aktas et al., Fuel Processing Technology 62 2000 1-15. The principle<br>
reactions of the two main processes, hydro-gasification and steam reforming,<br>
are shown here. The HGR independent reactions can be expressed as:<br><br><br>
Reactions 2 and 3 are endothermic. Reaction 1 is sufficiently<br>
exothermic to provide the heat of reaction for reactions 2 and 3. Some<br>
preheating of the HGR will be needed to bring the reactor up to its operating<br>
temperature. Thus, the HGR is intended to be self-sustaining once the<br>
reactions have started and achieve steady state.<br>
The main purpose of the HGR process is to maximize the carbon<br>
conversion from the feed stock into the energetic gases CH4 and CO. After<br>
this process, hydrogen is produced by reacting superheated steam with CH4<br>
and CO within the SPR. In the SPR, half the hydrogen is obtained from the<br>
superheated steam and the remainder from the CH4. The principle reactions<br>
in the SPR are considered to be:<br><br>
The steam reforming reactions (4 and 5) are often run with steam<br>
concentrations higher than required for the stiochiometry shown above. This<br>
is done to avoid coke formation and to improve conversion efficiency. The<br>
required steam concentration is usually specified in the form of the<br>
steam-to-carbon mole ratio (S:C), the ratio of water steam molecules per<br>
carbon atom in the HGR feed. The preferred (S:C) ratio for the SPR<br>
operation is greater than 3. This steam rich condition favors the water-gas<br>
shift reaction. This reaction is only slightly exothermic (∆H°= -41 kJ/mole<br>
CO); however, it produces additional hydrogen gas and converts carbon<br>
monoxide into carbon dioxide. Unfortunately, an additional unwanted<br>
secondary reaction can occur, the methanation reaction, which consumes<br>
hydrogen:<br><br><br>
The resulting effluent after the two main reactors is a synthesis of<br>
gases rich in hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and steam. Approximately half the<br>
hydrogen produced in the SPR is recycled back to the HGR. Consequently,<br>
no outside source of hydrogen is needed to maintain steady state operation.<br>
The HGR and SPR processes, therefore, may be considered to be chemically<br>
self-sustaining. The remaining synthesis gas is then available for the<br>
production of fuels and process heat.<br>
The present invention using the Fischer-Tropsch process can<br>
produce a zero-sulfur, ultrahigh cetane value diesel-like fuel and valuable<br>
paraffin wax products. The absence of sulfur enables low pollutant and<br>
particle emitting diesel fuels to be realized.<br>
The present invention also provides a source of by-products. One<br>
useful by-product is purified water, which can be re-cycled to create the slurry<br>
feed into the process. In a report by Rentech titled "Fischer-Tropsch<br>
technology" dated 1998 (see Rentech web publications at rentechinc.com),<br>
Rentech states that the Fischer-Tropsch process with ah iron catalyst makes<br>
about 7/10ths of a barrel of water per barrel of Fischer-Tropsch products. A<br>
cobalt catalyzed Fischer-Tropsch process makes about 1.1 to 1.3 barrels of<br>
water for each barrel of Fischer-Tropsch products, a greater amount than iron.<br>
Part of the water may be recycled to make steam in the steam reformer unit<br>
and for cooling in both the synthesis gas and Fischer-Tropsch step of the<br>
overall process.<br>
The Fischer-Tropsch reactions also produce tail gas that contains<br>
hydrogen, CO, CO2, and some light hydrocarbon gases. Hydrogen can be<br>
stripped out of the tail gas and recycled either to the HGR or the Fischer-<br>
Tropsch reactor. Any small amounts of other gases such as CO and CO2<br>
may be flared off.<br>
Two main products of Fischer-Tropsch may be characterized as<br>
synthetic oil and petroleum wax. According to Rentech, in the above report<br><br><br>
for their particular implementation of the Fischer-Tropsch process, the mix of<br>
solid wax to liquid ratio is about 50/50. Fischer-Tropsch products are totally<br>
free of sulfur, nitrogen, nickel, vanadium, asphaltenes, and aromatics that are<br>
typically found in crude oil. The products are almost exclusively paraffins and<br>
olefins with very few, or no, complex cyclic hydrocarbons or oxygenates that<br>
would otherwise require further separation and/or processing in order to be<br>
usable end-products. The absence of sulfur, nitrogen, and aromatics<br>
substantially reduces harmful emissions.<br>
California's Air Resources Board (CARB) specifications for diesel<br>
fuel require a minimum cetane value of 48 and reduced sulfur content. The<br>
above Rentech study with Shell diesel fuel produced from a Fischer-Tropsch<br>
process has a cetane value of 76. The CARB standard for sulfur in diesel fuel<br>
placed in the vehicle tank is 500 ppm by weight, and Shell's Fischer-Tropsch<br>
process diesel fuel has no detectable amount in the ppm range. The CARB<br>
standard for aromatic content is no more than 10% by volume (20% for small<br>
refineries). The Shell Fischer-Tropsch process diesel fuel had no detectable<br>
aromatics.<br>
Rentech further affirmed through studies that the diesel fuel may<br>
need no further processing because of the purity and olefin products that may<br>
even be advantageous over crude oil diesel. The Fischer-Tropsch diesel<br>
process is clean and the product is cleaner, has a higher cetane value, and<br>
most likely does not need further processing, when compared to a crude oil<br>
diesel.<br>
A gas turbine combined cycle for electric power production is an<br>
option. If the Fischer-Tropsch product is unexpectedly too costly, the use of<br>
the synthesis gas heating value can be a viable option, based on an overall<br>
efficiency of 65% of the synthesis gas energy converting to electric energy.<br>
This number is reasonable since the synthesis gas starts at a high<br>
temperature as opposed to taking natural gas in from a pipeline.<br><br><br>
Process modeling can be used to reasonably produce a synthesis<br>
gas maximized for a yield high in CO and stoichiometric hydrogen. First, the<br>
unit operation reactions of the hydro-gasifier, steam reformer, and<br>
Fischer-Tropsch reactors are modeled. This may be accomplished by using<br>
Stanjan, a DOS-based computer program that uses equilibrium modeling. By<br>
varying the parameters of temperature, pressure, original feedstock and gas<br>
flows, a parameterization study was carried out based on costs and output<br>
benefit. The hydro-gasifier variables were modified for the maximum practical<br>
carbon conversion efficiency. The steam reformer variables were modified for<br>
maximum practical CO output, enough hydrogen for recycling output, and<br>
minimum CO2 production. The study looked at the various parameters<br>
whereby two different values varied for one constant, resulting in 3-D<br>
parameterization studies. The following discusses the results from the<br>
computer modeling of the main reactions using Stanjan programming.<br>
Referring to Figure 2, the effect of varying the water or steam and<br>
hydrogen ratios on the conversion efficiency of carbon in feedstock in the<br>
HGR is shown at 800°C and 30 atm. As the hydrogen and water input to the<br>
HGR increases, the conversion efficiency of carbon in feedstock increases<br>
until it reaches 100%. The condition that falls in the area of 100% conversion<br>
efficiency achieves one of the modeling objectives, and these conditions were<br>
used. In order to avoid the cost of recycling of H2, the minimum amount of H2<br>
recycled to the HGR must be chosen. Figure 3 shows the effect of H2 and<br>
H2O on CH4 in the HGR at 800°C and 30 atm. Figure 4 shows the effect of H2<br>
and H2O on CO2 in the HGR at 800°C and 30 atm. At a high amount of H2<br>
and low amount of H2O input, the amount of CO2 is low. Although the<br>
objective is to minimize the amount of CO2 in the synthesis gas, it is not<br>
necessary to minimize CO2 in the HGR because CO2 is gauged in the SPR<br>
reactions through the water-gas-shift reaction to obtain a proper ratio of H2<br>
and CO for a maximum Fischer-Tropsch diesel fraction. Figure 5 shows the<br>
effect of H2 and H2O on CO in the HGR at 800°C and 30 atm.<br><br><br>
Figures 6, 7, 8 and 9 show the effects of varying temperature and<br>
pressure on the chemical composition of the effluent gases from the HGR at<br>
feed of 2.76 mol H2 and 0.066 mol H2O per mole C in the feed stock. At these<br>
conditions of H2 and H2O input to the HGR, the carbon conversion efficiency<br>
is estimated to close to 100% in a temperature range of 800 to 1000°C and a<br>
pressure range of 30 atm. to 50 atm, for equilibrium chemistry.<br>
Figure 10 shows the ratio of H2 and CO available for feed into the<br>
Fischer-Tropsch fuel synthesis reactor, against the steam content added to<br>
the SPR at 800°C and 30atm. This ratio increases with the increasing amount<br>
of steam added to the SPR and reaches 2.1 at about 3.94 mol steam (or<br>
water) added per mol C in feedstock. With this amount of steam added, the<br>
system will achieve chemical and thermal self-sustainability and provide a<br>
proper ratio of H2 and CO for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis of cetane. Figure 11<br>
shows the effect of H2O added to the SPR at 800°C and 30atm. Figures 12<br>
and 13 show the effect of temperature and pressure on the H2 and CO ratio<br>
and the conversion of CH4 in the SPR. At higher temperature and lower<br>
pressure, this ratio is higher. In a similar trend with the H2 and CO ratio, the<br>
conversion of CH4 increases with increasing temperature and with decreasing<br>
pressure. It is thus high temperature and low pressure favored in the SPR.<br>
The products of Fischer-Tropsch paraffinic liquid fuels are in a wide<br>
range of carbon number. According to the above Rentech report, about half<br>
of the products are diesel fuel. Also about half of the products come in the<br>
form of wax, with minor amounts of gases such as un-reacted reactants and<br>
hydrocarbon gases (methane, ethane, propane and so forth). To exemplify<br>
the present invention, cetane, which is in middle position of diesel range (C11<br>
to C20), was chosen as diesel fuel.<br>
The results of thermo-chemical and thermodynamic modeling of the<br>
hydro-gasified conversion of waste wood (biomass), as a prototypical<br>
carbonaceous feed material, were used to examine the details and illustrate<br>
the features of this invention. These simulations of the novel sequence of<br><br>
process reactors were undertaken to discover the thermo-chemical conditions<br>
needed to achieve the production of synthetic fuels. For example, in the<br>
production of synthetic diesel fuel, the objectives were to attain self-sustained<br>
operation of the first stage hydro-gasifier. In a particular embodiment, this is<br>
accomplished at an equilibrium temperature of 1000°C (738°C when<br>
adiabatic) and 30 atmospheres pressure with a total hydrogen to carbon feed<br>
mole ratio of at least 3.48:1 (1.67:1 when adiabatic), and water to carbon feed<br>
ratio of at least 0.07:1 (0.43 when adiabatic), a water steam to carbon feed<br>
mole ratio of at least 3.91:1 (1.67:1 when adiabatic) into the second stage<br>
steam reforming reactor also operating at an equilibrium temperature of<br>
1000°C (900°C when adiabatic) and 30 atmospheres pressure, to obtain<br>
conditions for simultaneous optimal quantities of product hydrogen for self-<br>
sustained operation of the first stage hydro-gasification reactor and an<br>
adequate hydrogen to carbon mole ratio of at least 2.1:1 in the residual<br>
synthesis gas stream to feed the third stage Fischer-Tropsch reactor,<br>
operating at 200°C and 10 atmospheres pressure, and adiabatic self-<br>
sustained operation of a special HGR and SPR combination reactor, followed<br>
by a conventionally operated SPR and Fischer-Tropsch reactors, with full<br>
thermal and chemical potential energy management. The inventors have<br>
found that higher temperature Fischer-Tropsch reactors can provide higher<br>
quality exothermic heat up to 350°C, with appropriate change in catalyst.<br>
Tables 1 through 5 show the overall energy transfer rates into and<br>
out from each heat exchanger and power conversion component for each<br>
operating mode of the conversion process. The mass flow, molal flow, thermal<br>
energy management, water/steam and molten salt schematic diagrams for<br>
each of the five operating modes of the conversion process are also shown as<br>
Figs14-18, 19-23, 24-28, 29-33 and 34-38 respectively. Tables 6 and 7<br>
summarize the results of the performance studies and process configuration<br>
parameters for each of the five operating modes of the conversion process.<br><br><br>
The inventors have found that adequate kinetic performance of the<br>
processes described can be achieved at temperatures of about 750°C. At<br>
lower operating temperatures, about 800 °C or lower, a lower temperature<br>
heat transfer fluid such as a molten salt system or a water-steam system<br>
could be used to transfer heat. Thus, water-steam heat transfer loops can<br>
replace the molten salt loops for transferring heat at lower operating<br>
temperatures.<br>
The carbonaceous material feed process initially described above<br>
uses a water slurry suspension feed technology, originally developed by<br>
Texaco for use in its partial-oxidation gasifiers, that can accept a wide variety<br>
of carbonaceous materials, and can be metered by controlled pumping into<br>
the first stage hydrogen gasification reactor (HGR) to produce a methane rich<br>
gas with high conversion efficiency (measured to have at least 85% carbon<br>
feed chemical utilization efficiency). Enough heat is available to be able to<br>
generate super-heated steam from the biomass-water slurry feed to supply<br>
and operate the second stage steam-methane reformer. The reformer product<br>
gas is fed into a hydrogen membrane filter that allows almost pure hydrogen<br>
to pass back into the first stage reactor to sustain the hydro-gasification of the<br>
biomass. The remaining second stage product gas, not passing through the<br>
hydrogen filter, is cooled to condense and re-cycle any water vapor present<br>
back into the slurry carbonaceous feed system. The unfiltered gas is fed into<br>
the fuel synthesis reactors, which comprise a Fischer-Tropsch paraffin hydro-<br>
carbon synthesis reactor, which operates at 200°C and 10 atmospheres<br>
pressure. Process modeling reveals that the hydrogen/carbon molecular feed<br>
ratio must be at least 2.1:1 to optimize production of chemically pure and<br>
clean-burning [sulfur-free] diesel-like liquid fuels and high value chemically<br>
pure paraffin-like waxes, without additional fuel or energy. (Figs. 14-18 and<br>
Tables 1, 6 and 7 or Figs. 34-38 and Tables 5, 6 and 7 for adiabatic first stage<br>
reactor operation), or a dimethyl ether synthesis reactor, which operates at<br>
200°C and 70 atmospheres pressure. This reactor produces approximately<br>
92.4% DME and 7,1% methanol. The methanol is combusted to co-generate<br><br><br>
about 30 MW of electricity and 20MW of process heat for exchange with the<br>
molten salt and water/steam heat transfer loops (see Figs. 19-23 and Tables<br>
2, 6 and 7), hydrogen gaseous fuel synthesis (see Figs. 24-28 and Tables 3, 6<br>
and 7), and all electric power production without fuel synthesis (see Figs. 29-<br>
33 and Table 4, 6 and 7).<br>
Net export of electric power is possible in all five modes of<br>
operation of the simulated biomass hydro-gasification process plant. The<br>
results of these simulations are summarized in Table 6 and 7. The overall<br>
energy utilization goes from 50.7% (71.2% when adiabatic) for Fischer-<br>
Tropsch synthesis to 67.2% for hydrogen production. Optimized electric<br>
power production utilizes about 38.2% of the chemical potential energy in the<br>
biomass feed stock for clean-burning power conversion. In general the<br>
process modes could be switched using an appropriate proportional valve to<br>
distribute the synthesis gas production after separation of enough pure<br>
hydrogen gas for the first stage hydro-gasification reactor.<br>
The results of the overall modeling shown in Figure 1 are<br>
summarized as follows.<br>

30atm; 2.76 mol H2 per mol C in feedstock to maintain self-sustainability;<br>
0.066 mol H2O per mol C in feedstock.<br>

In another embodiment of the invention, a process is provided that<br>
combines steam pyrolysis and hydro-gasification into a single step for the<br>
production of energetic gases from carbonaceous material. The process<br>
comprises heating carbonaceous material simultaneously in the presence of<br><br><br>
both hydrogen and steam. At sufficient temperatures and pressures, steam<br>
pyrolysis can enhance the hydro-gasification of carbonaceous materials.<br>
The combination of steam pyrolysis and hydro-gasification can<br>
enhance the rates at which hydrocarbon gases are produced from natural and<br>
synthetic carbonaceous substances such as plant material, coal and synthetic<br>
polymers, and from carbonaceous materials such as biomass and municipal<br>
waste containing such natural and synthetic substances.<br>
By combining steam pyrolysis and hydro-gasification into a single<br>
step, a carbonaceous material can be effectively converted into energetic<br>
gases without first subjecting the material to a separate steam pyrolysis step.<br>
More particularly, in accordance with the present invention, non-pyrolyzed<br>
carbonaceous material can bypass the steam generator and go directly into<br>
the hydro-gasification reactor, where the non-pyrolyzed carbonaceous<br>
material can undergo the combined process of steam pyrolysis and hydro-<br>
gasification. The carbonaceous material can be prepared as a slurry, which is<br>
fed into the hydro-gasification reactor through piping that connects a source of<br>
the slurry to the reactor. Steam can be fed into the reactor through piping<br>
from the steam generator, and hydrogen can be fed into the reactor through<br>
piping from the steam pyrolytic reformer.<br>
The following Examples illustrate the process of combining steam<br>
pyrolysis and hydro-gasification in the production of energetic gases from<br>
wood (Examples 1 -7), synthetic polymers (Examples 8-10), and coal<br>
(Example 11).<br>
Example 1<br>
This example provides a way to carry out steam pyrolysis and<br>
hydro-gasification in a micro-batch reactor using real time analysis of gases.<br>
Pine wood bedding chip material was used as a representative<br>
carbonaceous material. Referring to Figure 39, the pine wood material, water<br>
and a gas were added to a reactor vessel 62 and quickly brought to a desired<br><br><br>
temperature by immersing the vessel in a molten salt bath 64. The vessel<br>
was directly coupled to a sample injector 66 and a residual gas analyzer 68<br>
for real-time analysis of the various gas species produced by pyrolysis and<br>
hydro-gasification. The partial pressures of the gas species were determined<br>
over the course the reaction.<br>
Figure 40 provides a typical data record display of the experimental<br>
results. Partial pressures values over time are shown for hydrogen 70,<br>
methane 72, carbon monoxide 74, and carbon dioxide 76, as well as other<br>
gas species.<br>
In a typical set of experiments, the process combining steam<br>
pyrolysis and hydro-gasification was compared with three other types of<br>
pyrolytic processes - dry pyrolysis with helium gas, dry pyrolysis with<br>
hydrogen gas, and steam pyrolysis with helium gas.<br>
The dry pyrolysis process with helium gas was carried out by<br>
adding a pine wood sample and helium to the reactor vessel, then heating.<br>
Although no water was added to the reactor vessel, some water may have<br>
been present in the pine wood sample due to incomplete drying of the pine<br>
wood material. Because helium is an inert gas, this process can be<br>
considered to generate products only as a result of thermolysis.<br>
The dry pyrolysis process with hydrogen gas was carried out by<br>
adding a pine wood sample and hydrogen to the reactor vessel, then heating.<br>
No water was added. Since hydrogen gas is not inert, the dry pyrolysis of the<br>
pine wood sample in the presence of hydrogen will induce reduction reactions<br>
with elements in the biomass molecules as well as any pyrolytic action<br>
dissociating the biomass molecules by thermolysis.<br>
The steam pyrolysis process with helium gas is considered<br>
representative of the steam pyrolysis process by itself. The process was<br>
carried out by adding pine wood material, water and helium to the reactor<br>
vessel, then heating.<br>
21<br><br>
Table 8 provides an analysis of the pine wood material used in the<br>
example compared with pine wood material used by others in previous<br>
studies. Values for the elemental (or "ultimate") analysis indicate that the pine<br>
wood used in the example is comparable to that studied by others.<br>
Example 2<br>
This example provides rate constant measurements for the<br>
production of methane gas and carbon monoxide from pine wood material<br>
subjected to the four pyrolytic processes.<br>
Each pyrolytic process was carried out as described in Example 1.<br>
Process temperatures were about 580 - 600 °C ("600 °C"), 670 - 690 °C<br>
("670 °C"), and 770 - 790 °C ("770 °C"). The nominal particle size of the pine<br>
wood samples was less than about 425 microns (0.425 mm diameter).<br>
Figure 41 provides a bar graph showing rate constants in moles per<br>
minute for the production of methane gas at different temperatures. At each<br>
temperature, the rate constant for steam pyrolysis with helium was greater<br>
than the rate constant for either dry pyrolysis process. For example, the rate<br>
constant 78 for steam pyrolysis at 670 °C was greater than the rate constant<br>
80 for dry pyrolysis with helium and the rate constant 82 for dry pyrolysis with<br>
hydrogen. Further, at both 670 °C and 770 °C, the rate constants for the<br>
combined process of steam pyrolysis and hydro-gasification were greater than<br>
the rate constants for steam pyrolysis alone. For example, at 770 °C, the rate<br>
constant 84 for steam pyrolysis and hydro-gasification was about twice as<br>
great as the rate constant 86 for steam pyrolysis.<br>
Similar results are shown in Figure 42, which provides a bar graph<br>
showing rate constants for the production of carbon monoxide at various<br>
temperatures. Again, at each temperature, the rate constant was greater for<br>
steam pyrolysis than for either dry pyrolysis process. Also, at 770 °C, the rate<br>
constant for steam pyrolysis and hydro-gasification was greater than the rate<br>
constant for steam pyrolysis alone.<br><br><br>
These results indicate that steam pyrolysis alone, or combined with<br>
hydro-gasification, can provide increased rates of production of methane gas<br>
and carbon monoxide from carbonaceous material, and that rates of<br>
production for the process of steam pyrolysis and hydro-gasification can<br>
exceed rates of production for the process of steam pyrolysis alone.<br>
Example 3<br>
This example provides measurements of the total conversion of<br>
carbon to carbon containing gases for pine wood material subjected to the<br>
four pyrolytic processes.<br>
Each pyrolytic process was carried out as described in Example 2.<br>
Figure 43 is a bar graph showing the % conversion of carbon to<br>
carbon containing gases at different temperatures. At each temperature, the<br>
% conversion was greater for steam pyrolysis than for either dry pyrolysis<br>
process. In addition, at 670 °C and 770 °C, the % conversion for steam<br>
pyrolysis and hydro-gasification was greater than the % conversion for steam<br>
pyrolysis alone.<br>
These data indicate that steam pyrolysis alone, or combined with<br>
hydro-gasification, can enhance the total conversion of carbon to carbon<br>
containing gases, and that conversion by steam pyrolysis and hydro-<br>
gasification can be greater than by steam pyrolysis alone. Further, the<br>
advantages of steam pyrolysis and hydro-gasification can improve with<br>
increasing temperature.<br>
Example 4<br>
This example provides an analysis of the gas species produced<br>
from pine wood material subjected to one of the four pyrolytic processes.<br>
Each pyrolytic reaction was carried out as in Example 1 at a reactor<br>
temperature of about 770 °C.<br><br><br>
Figure 44 is a bar graph showing the product gas composition for<br>
each pyrolytic process. The results indicate that steam pyrolysis can shift the<br>
product gases away from the oxides of carbon and to the hydrocarbon gases,<br>
with methane in the lead. For example, dry pyrolysis with helium produced a<br>
gas composition 88 for carbon monoxide of about 64% and a gas composition<br>
90 for carbon dioxide of about 18%, for a total carbon oxides composition of<br>
about 82%. The gas composition 92 for methane was about 14% for dry<br>
pyrolysis with helium. With steam pyrolysis, the gas composition 94 for<br>
carbon monoxide was about 45% and the gas composition 96 for carbon<br>
dioxide about 26%, for a total carbon oxides composition of about 71%, while<br>
the gas composition 98 for methane was raised to about 22%.<br>
In addition, the methane composition 100 for steam pyrolysis and<br>
hydro-gasification was greater than the methane composition 98 for steam<br>
pyrolysis alone. The results indicate that the process of steam pyrolysis and<br>
hydro-gasification can provide more hydrocarbon gases than steam pyrolysis<br>
alone.<br>
Example 5<br>
This example provides measurements of carbon conversion into<br>
energetic gases for pine wood subjected to the four pyrolytic processes.<br>
Each pyrolytic reaction was carried out as described in Example 2.<br>
Figure 45 is a bar graph showing the % carbon conversion into<br>
energetic gases at different temperatures. The energetic gases included all<br>
gases produced except carbon dioxide and water vapor. The % carbon<br>
conversion was greater for steam pyrolysis than for either dry pyrolysis<br>
process. Also, at 670 °C and 770 °C, the % carbon conversion for steam<br>
pyrolysis and hydro-gasification was greater than the % carbon conversion for<br>
steam pyrolysis alone.<br>
These results indicate that steam pyrolysis alone, or steam<br>
pyrolysis combined with hydro-gasification, can enhance the total conversion<br><br><br>
of carbon into energetic gases, and also indicate that conversion by steam<br>
pyrolysis and hydro-gasification can be greater than by steam pyrolysis alone.<br>
In addition, the advantages of steam pyrolysis and hydro-gasification over<br>
steam pyrolysis alone can improve with increasing temperature.<br>
Example 6<br>
This example provides % carbon conversion at various particle<br>
sizes in a micro-batch reactor.<br>
Dry pyrolysis with hydrogen, and steam pyrolysis combined with<br>
hydro-gasification, were carried out as in Example 1. The temperature range<br>
was about 660-680 °C. Three nominal particle size ranges were evaluated:<br>
less than about 425 microns (0.425 mm diameter); about 425 -500 microns<br>
(O.425-.500 mm diameter); and about 500-1000 microns (0.500-1 mm<br>
diameter).<br>
Figure 46 is a bar graph showing % carbon conversion at different<br>
particle size ranges. The % carbon conversion 102 for steam pyrolysis and<br>
hydro-gasification in the 425-500 micron particle size range was similar to the<br>
% carbon conversion 104 for steam pyrolysis and hydro-gasification in the<br>
500-1000 microns particle size range. In this experiment, particle sizes less<br>
than 1000 microns did not appear to enhance carbon conversion in the micro-<br>
batch reactor under the experimental conditions employed.<br>
Example 7<br>
This example shows gas production from pine wood material at<br>
various micro-batch reactor pressures.<br>
Steam pyrolysis combined with hydro-gasification was performed as<br>
in Example 1 at a temperature range of about 770-790 °C, with a nominal pine<br>
wood particle size of less than about 425 microns, and a pressure of about 10<br>
bar (132 psig) or 39 bar (560 pi).<br><br>
Figure 47 is a graph showing the product gas composition for each<br>
of the most abundant gas species produced at the two different pressures.<br>
Similar to the results of Example 4 and Figure 6, the total gas composition of<br>
carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide at high pressure was less than the total<br>
gas composition of the carbon oxides at low pressure. Also, the methane<br>
composition was greater at higher pressure. These results indicate that an<br>
increase in pressure can push the reduction of carbon in the direction of<br>
hydrocarbon gases at the expense of carbon oxides. This can provide a<br>
process which promotes the production of methane gas while simultaneously<br>
reducing the production of carbon oxides.<br>
Example 8<br>
This example provides the results of experiments in which<br>
poiyurethane foam material was subjected to steam pyrolysis and hydro-<br>
gasification at different temperatures and pressures.<br>

are shown for methane 122, C3H8 124, carbon monoxide 126, and carbon<br>
dioxide 128.<br>
EXAMPLE 9<br>
This example provides the results of experiments in which<br>
polyvinylchloride ("PVC") material was subjected to steam pyrolysis and<br>
hydro-gasification.<br>
Steam pyrolysis was carried out as in Example 1, with ground PVC<br>
material of about 0.5 to 1 mm in diameter as the carbonaceous material and<br>
argon gas substituting for helium as the inert gas. Figure 51 provides the<br>
results for a steam pyrolysis reaction carried out at a temperature of about<br>
720 °C, a starting pressure of about 41.4 bar, and a steam to sample mass<br>
ratio of about 1:1. Partial pressure values over time are shown for hydrogen<br>
130, methane 132, carbon monoxide 134, carbon dioxide 136, and argon gas<br>

carried out as in Example 1, at a temperature of about 700 °C, a starting<br>
pressure of about 31.0 bar, and a steam to sample mass ratio of about 1:1.<br>
Figure 52 provides the results of the reaction. Partial pressure values over<br>
time are shown for hydrogen 140 (values shown as H2/10), methane 142,<br>
C2H6 144, carbon monoxide 146, and carbon dioxide 148.<br>
EXAMPLE 10<br>
This example provides the results of experiments in which<br>
polymeric tire rubber material was subjected to steam pyrolysis and hydro-<br>
gasification.<br>
Steam pyrolysis in helium gas was carried out as in Example 1, with<br>
ground polymeric tire rubber material of about 0.5 to 1 mm in diameter as the<br>
carbonaceous material. Figure 53 provides the results for a reaction carried<br>
out at a temperature of about 700 °C, a starting pressure of about 45.5 bar,<br>
and a steam to rubber mass ratio of about 1:1. Partial pressure values over<br><br><br>
time are shown for hydrogen 150, methane 152, C2H6 154, and carbon<br>
monoxide 156.<br>
Figure 54 provides the results for a reaction combining steam<br>
pyrolysis and hydro-gasification, carried out at a temperature of about 700 °C,<br>
a starting pressure of about 41.4 bar, and a steam to sample mass ratio of<br>
about 1:1. Partial pressure values over time are shown for hydrogen 158,<br>
methane 160, and C2H6162.<br>
Quantitative data obtained from the experiments presented in<br>
Examples 8-10 are summarized in Table 9 for polyurethane foam ("PUF"),<br>
polyvinylchloride, and polymeric tire rubber ("TR"). The table lists: a) the<br>
process used - hydro-gasification ("HGR") and/or steam pyrolysis ("SPY");<br>
b) the steam to sample mass ratio; c) the batch-reactor temperature<br>
maintained by the molten salt bath; d) the maximum internal batch-reactor<br>
pressure attained during the experiment; e) the time ("t m rate") from the start<br>
of the experiment for the major gaseous product, methane, to achieve its<br>
maximum production rate; f) the measured maximum rate of methane<br>
production ("d[CH4]/dt") in mole percent per second; and g) the ratio of the<br>
value defined above to the standard value for hydro-gasification without steam<br>
pyrolysis.<br>
The results for the polyurethane foam material show that the use of<br>
steam pyrolysis can enhance the kinetic rate for the production of methane.<br>
In these experiments, the maximum enhancement measured, for a steam to<br>
sample mass ratio of 2, is a factor of 5.9 faster than the rate measured for a<br>
steam to sample mass ratio of 0.5. Thus, increasing the quantity of steam<br>
used in the steam pyrolysis process can enhance the hydro-gasification rate<br>
for the production of methane.<br>
The results for the PVC material are listed next in Table 9. The<br>
measured rate of production of methane by steam pyrolysis and hydro-<br><br><br>
gasification was increased by a factor of 3 above that for steam pyrolysis<br>
alone.<br>
Finally, the results of testing the polymeric tire rubber material are<br>
listed. The measured rate of production of methane by steam pyrolysis and<br>
hydro-gasification was increased by a factor of 1.5 above that for steam<br>
pyrolysis alone.<br>
The results summarized in Table 9 indicate that increased methane<br>
production rates can be achieved in a hydrogasifier reactor when co-<br>
processing plastic and polymeric samples with steam pyrolysis.<br>
EXAMPLE 11<br>
In this example, coal was subjected to steam pyrolysis and hydro-<br>
gasification.<br>
Steam pyrolysis and hydro-gasification were carried out as in<br>
Example 1, with coal as the carbonaceous material. The coal composition<br>
was about 74.9% wt carbon, 4.9% wt hydrogen, 1.2% wt nitrogen, 0.7% wt<br>
sulfur and 11.9% wt minerals. Proximate analysis of the coal showed about<br>
24.0% wt moisture, 10.0% wt ash, 35.2% wt vol. mat., 52.4% wt Fix. [C], and<br>
mesh 60. The nominal start conditions for all experiments were sample mass<br>
of about 100 mg, salt bath set temperature of about 700 °C, and gasification<br>
agent fill pressure of about 6.0 bar at about 22 °C.<br>
Table 10 provides the results for the processes of dry pyrolysis with<br>
hydrogen gas ("Dry HGR"), dry pyrolysis with helium gas ("Dry pyro."), steam<br>
pyrolysis with helium gas ("SPY"), and combined steam pyrolysis and hydro-<br>
gasification ("HGR+S.PY"). The table lists: a) the gas used; b) the water to<br>
coal sample mass ratio ("[H20]/[C]"); c) the measured methane production<br>
rate ("d[CH4]/dt"), normalized for any changes in the absolute pressure in the<br>
reactor; d) relative methane production rate ratio ("dry He [CH4]/dt"),<br>
normalized to the methane production rate of dry pyrolysis with helium gas;<br><br><br>
and e) relative methane production rate ratio ("dry H2 [CH4]/dt"), normalized<br>
to the methane production rate of dry pyrolysis with hydrogen gas.<br>
The results show that combining steam pyrolysis and hydro-gasification can<br>
enhance the methane production from the volatile matter in the coal. In these<br>
experiments, the methane production rate of steam pyrolysis in the presence<br>
of helium gas was greater by a factor of over 42 times the rate without water<br>
present. Similarly, the methane production rate of dry pyrolysis with hydrogen<br>
gas was enhanced by about 40% over the rate of dry pyrolysis using an inert<br>
gas, helium. However, there was a significant increase in the methane<br>
production rate when hydro-gasification and steam pyrolysis were combined.<br>
For example, the methane production rate was increased by close to a factor<br>
of 10, when the water to coal mass ratio was about 1.5, and by a factor well<br>
over 100 times the dry hydropyrolysis rate when the water to coal mass ratio<br>
was about of 3.0.<br>
These same results are shown graphically in the form of a bar chart<br>
in Figure 55, where, for example, the water to coal mass ratio 164 for one bar<br>
(read from the left axis) is positioned over the methane production rate 166 of<br>
the same bar (read from the right axis).<br>
These results indicate that combining steam pyrolysis with hydro-<br>
gasification of coal can enhance methane production rates.<br>

Abstract of the Invention<br><br><br>
A process and apparatus for producing a synthesis gas for use as a gaseous fuel or as feed into<br>
a Fischer-Tropsch reactor to produce a liquid fuel in a substantially self sustaining process. In<br>
one embodiment, a slurry of carbonaceous material in water, and hydrogen from an internal<br>
source, are fed into a hydro-gasification reactor to generate methane rich producer gases<br>
which are fed in to a steam pyrolytic reformer to generate synthesis gas comprising hydrogen<br>
and carbon monoxide. A portion of the hydrogen is used as the internal hydrogen source. The<br>
remaining synthesis gas is either used as fuel to produce electricity and/or process heat or is<br>
fed into a Fischer-Tropsch reactor to produce liquid fuel. In another embodiment of the<br>
invention, carbonaceous material can be heated simultaneously in the presence of both<br>
hydrogen and steam to undergo steam pyrolysis and hydro-gasification in a single step.</td>
