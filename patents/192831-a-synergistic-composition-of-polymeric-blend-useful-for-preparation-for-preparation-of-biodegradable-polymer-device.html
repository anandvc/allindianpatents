				<td>The invention  relates to  a  synergistic composition  of polymeric blend useful for preparation of biodegradable polymer device.  The device may be in the form of micro particles, micro spheres, implants, pellets, discs, beads, rings film, sheets, capsules, etc. and useful for the controlled release or immobilization or supporting of active ingredients, such as drugs,  dyes,  proteins peptides,  vaccines,  hormones,  steroids,  enzymes, microorganisms, catalysts, flavors, nutrients, tracers, inhibitors, promoters, etc.   More particularly, this invention relates to a composition of polymeric blend which contains two polymers of which one is soft and the other is rigid at ambient temperature.  Still more particularly, this invention relates to the preparation of polymeric blends of two polymers wherein both the polymers are biocompatible, biodegradable and mutually miscible, the biodegradation rate of the rigid polymer being significantly lower than that of the soft polymer such that, when the devices prepared out of these blends are exposed to a degrading medium, the soft, fast-degrading polymer in them degrades preferentially which results in rigid micro porous devices whose porosity is directly proportional to the content of the soft polymer, and which consists almost entirely of the rigid polymer. This invention also relates to the preparation of the above mentioned type of polymeric devices from the said type of blends into which active ingredients such as those mentioned above are incorporated.     Devices prepared from the polymeric blends claimed in the present invention have potential applications in the field of controlled delivery of active substance such as drug, agriculture, pesticides, cosmetics, foodstuffs, enzyme   immobilization,   catalysis,   biochemical   and   microbial   reactions,   imaging, separation technology.<br>
In prior art, many references are there on the use of blends of two or more polymers to improve processability or product quality .    Prior  art   relating to the preparation of<br>
devices from biodegradable polymer blends is also known. Examples are (1) A. J.<br>
Domb, M. Maniar and A. T. S. Haffer, PCT Int. Apple. WO 92 13, 567, 20 Aug 1992. In this patent a blend of two or more biodegradable polymers is prepared by a oil/oil emulsion method wherein the two polymers used are Poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) and Poly(lactic acid). The microspheres are prepared by oil/oil/water emulsion-solvent evaporation method. (2) T. Suzuki, Y. Nishioka, Y. Matsukawa, A. Matsumoto and M. Kobayashi, Eur. Pat. Appl. EP 595, 030, . 04 May 1994; consisting of blends of polyesters and/or polyanhydrides used as pharmaceutical carriers; e.g. Poly(lactic acid) and Poly(sebaccic acid). (3) A. J. Domb, J. Polym. Sci., Part A, Polym. Chem., 31, 1973 (1993). This paper describes the screening of miscible polymers from degradable polymer blends. Aliphatic, aromatic and copolymers of polyanhydrides are miscible in each other and form less crystalline compositions with a single melting point. The polyesters; Poly(lactide-glycolide), Poly(caprolactone), and Poly(hydroxybutyric acid) presented some miscibility with each other. However, the polyanhydrides were immiscible with the polyesters resulting in a complete phase separation. (4) S. J. Huang, O. Kitchen and L. J. DiBenedetto, Polym. Mater. Sci. Eng., 62, 804 (1990).<br>
But no prior art is known in which the blend of a soft, fast-degrading, fully synthetic, biodegradable and biocompatible polymer and a rigid, slow-degrading, fully synthetic, biodegradable and biocompatible polymer is used for the preparation of polymeric devices where the objectives are to reduce the porosity created during preparation of the devices, if prepared by solvent removal methods, and to obtain devices which develop, in a degrading environment, porosity which is proportional to the   content  of the soft polymer, thereby providing  variability  and  control   on<br><br>
porosity.   Therefore, the blends prepared by the process of this invention are novel and of considerable practical significance.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides, a synergistic composition of polymeric blend useful for preparation of biodegradable polymer device which comprises 1.76 to 5.28% by weight of one or more soft, fast degrading polymers such as herein described and 1.76 to 5.28% by weight of one or more rigid, slow-degrading polymers as defined herein, balance volatile organic solvent and optionally 3-20% by wt. an active ingredient.<br>
It is to be noted that this technique of microsphere preparation does not involve any chemical reaction between the polymers and the solvents and the soft and rigid polymers. Yet the morphological and release characteristics of the composition so produced are entirely different from those of the components of the mixture taken individually due to synergism in the ingredients used.<br>
In one of the embodiments of the present invention, the process comprises of preparing a clear homogeneous solution mixture by dissolving a soft, fast - degrading polymer and a rigid, slow - degrading polymer in a volatile organic solvent and preparing microspheres from the said solution mixture by conventional microsphere preparation methods namely oil - in - water, oil - in -oil and water - in - oil - in - water emulsion.<br><br>
The oil-in-water system consists of an oil soluble active ingredient dissolved in<br>
volatile organic solvent along with the polymer forming the oil phase which is then injected into a 0.5% aqueous solution of Poly(vinyl alcohol), which is the water phase, forming an oil-in-water emulsion.<br>
The oil-in-oil system consists of an oil soluble active ingredient dissolved in a volatile organic solvent along with the polymer forming the oil i phase which is then injected into liquid paraffin or silicone oil containing 8% sorbitan monooleate. which is the oil 2 phase, forming an oil-in-oil emulsion.<br>
The water-in-oil-in-water system consists of a water soluble active ingredient dissolved in distilled water forming the water 1 phase, which is then emulsified in the volatile organic solvent containing the polymer to form the water-in-oil emulsion, which is further injected into' 0.5% aqueous solution of Poly(vinyl alcohol) which is the water 2 phase, forming a water-in-oil-in-water emulsion.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention, the composition comprises of mixing the melt of a soft, fast-degrading polymer and that of a rigid, slow-degrading polymer to obtain a homogeneous melt mixture, and preparing microspheres by conventional melt-dispersion methods.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the composition comprises of preparing a homogeneous melt mixture of one or more soft, fast-degrading polymers and one or more rigid, slow-degrading polymers and forming the said melt mixture, by the use of conventional processing techniques such as injection molding, extrusion.<br><br>
casting, coating, melt-pressing, melt-dispersion, etc. into devices such as implants, pellets, discs, rings, beads, films, sheets, etc.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the blends containing active ingredients were prepared by the process of the present invention which comprises of dissolving or dispersing, as solution or solid, the desired active ingredient in the said polymer solution mixture or melt, and processing the resultant mixture as described in any of the embodiments mentioned above.<br>
Some examples for the said soft polymers used for the preparation of the above mentioned devices are is Poly ( carboxyphenoxyualeric acid ) , Poly ( carboxyphenoxyoctanoic acid ) or a Poly (carboxyphenoxyvaleric -co - carboxyphenoxyoctanoic acid) copolymer and the said rigid polymer is Poly ( carboxyphenoxyhexane), Poly ( carboxyphenoxy-propane) or Poly ( carboxyphenoxypropane-co-sebasic acid) (85 : 15) copolymer. The active ingredient used is selected from drugs, dyes, proteins, peptides, vaccines, hormones, steroids, enzymes, microorganisms, catalysts, flavors, nutrients, tracers, inhibitors, promoters, etc.<br>
The composition is a synergistic mixture which has the morphological and release characteristic properties which are entirely different from either of the components of the ingredients. The ratio of the soft polymer to the rigid polymer in the blend that can be employed in the preparation of the said polymeric blends is dependent on several factors. The highest content of the soft polymer in the blend is limited to a level where the resultant micro spheres possess sufficient mechanical strength and are able to retain their individuality. In most cases a minimum of 10 percent of the rigid polymer would be required. Another criterion to be satisfied is the miscibility of the polymers to ensure the homogeneity of the microspheres.<br><br>

The polymeric composition prepared in the present invention has several advantages over the ones known in prior art. The incorporation of the soft, fast-degrading polymer due to their better chain flexibility helps to form denser microspheres during the preparation of the microspheres by solvent removal methods. This minimizes the unwanted diffusional release through pores other than those intended to be created by the degradation of the soft polymer. The preferential degradation of the soft, fast-degrading polymer from the microspheres allows the generation of porosity in the release environment affording the release of the active ingredient. The porosity of these microspheres is directly proportional to the amount of the soft polymer in the blend which allows the preparation of microspheres with any desired level of porosity.<br><br><br><br><br>
We Claim:<br>
1.	A synergistic composition of polymeric blend useful for preparation of biodegradable polymer device which comprises 1.76 to 5.28% by weight of one or more soft , fast degrading polymers such as herein described and 1.76 to 5.28% by weight of one or more rigid, slow-degrading polymers as defined herein, balance volatile organic solvent and optionally 3-20% by wt. an active ingredient.<br>
