A COMFORTABLE OPHTHALMIC DEVICE AND METHODS OF ITS<br>
PRODUCTION<br>
RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application is a non-provisional filing of two provisional applications,<br>
U.S. Serial No. 60/652,809, filed on February 14, 2005 and U.S. Serial No.<br>
60/695,783 filed on June 30, 2005.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to comfortable ophthalmic devices and methods of<br>
producing such devices.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Contact lenses have been used commercially to improve vision since the<br>
1950s. The first contact lenses were made of hard materials. Although these<br>
lenses are currently used, they are not suitable for all patients due to their poor<br>
initial comfort. Later developments in the field gave rise to soft contact lenses,<br>
based upon hydrogels, which are extremely popular today. These lenses have<br>
higher oxygen permeabilities and such are often more comfortable to wear than<br>
contact lenses made of hard materials. However, these new lenses are not<br>
without problems.<br>
Contact lenses can be worn by many users for 8 hours to several days<br>
in a row without any adverse reactions such as redness, soreness, mucin<br>
buildup and symptoms of contact lens related dry eye. However, some users<br>
begin to develop these symptoms after only a few hours of use. Many of those<br>
contact lens wearers use rewetting solutions to alleviate discomfort associated<br>
with these adverse reactions with some success. However the use of these<br>
solutions require that users carry extra solutions and this can be inconvenient.<br>
For these users a more comfortable contact lens that does not require the use<br>
of rewetting solutions would be useful. Therefore there is a need for such<br>
contact lenses and methods of making such contact lenses. It is this need that<br>
is met by the following invention.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention includes a method of producing ophthalmic lenses<br>
comprising, consisting essentially of, or consisting of, treating a polymerized<br>
ophthalmic lens with a wetting agent, provided that the ophthalmic lens<br>
formulation does not comprise said wetting agent prior to its polymerization.<br>
As used herein, "ophthalmic lens" refers to a device that resides in or on<br>
the eye. These devices can provide optical correction or may be cosmetic.<br>
Ophthalmic lenses include but are not limited to soft contact lenses, intraocular<br>
lenses, overlay lenses, ocular inserts, and optical inserts. The preferred lenses<br>
of the invention are soft contact lenses made from silicone elastomers or<br>
hydrogels, which include but are not limited to silicone hydrogels, and<br>
fluorohydrogels. Soft contact lens formulations are disclosed in US Patent No.<br>

WO 2006/088758	PCT/US2006/004877<br>
The term "formulation" refers to the un-po!ymerized mixture of<br>
components used to prepare ophthalmic lenses. These components include<br>
but are not limited to monomers, pre-polymers, diluents, catalysts, initiators<br>
tints, UV blockers, antibacterial agents, polymerization inhibitors, and the like.<br>
These formulations can be polymerized, by thermal, chemical, and light<br>
initiated curing techniques described in the foregoing references as well as<br>
other references in the ophthalmic lens field. As used herein, the terms<br>
"polymerized" or "polymerization" refers to these processes. The preferred<br>
methods of polymerization are the light initiated techniques disclosed in U.S.<br>
Pat. No. 6,822,016 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
As used herein the term "treating" refers to physical methods of<br>
contacting the wetting agents and the ophthalmic lens. These methods<br>
exclude placing a drop of a solution containing wetting agent into the eye of an<br>
ophthalmic lens wearer or placing a drop of such a solution onto an ophthalmic<br>
lens prior to insertion of that lens into the eye of a user. Preferably treating<br>
refers to physical methods of contacting the wetting agents with the ophthalmic<br>
lenses prior to selling or otherwise delivering the ophthalmic lenses to a patient.<br>
The ophthalmic lenses may be treated with the wetting agent anytime after they<br>
are polymerized. It is preferred that the polymerized ophthalmic lenses be<br>
treated with wetting agents at temperature of greater than about 50°C. For<br>
example in some processes to manufacture contact lenses, an un-polymerized,<br>
or partially polymerized formulation is placed between two mold halves,<br>
spincasted, or static casted and polymerized. See, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,495,313;<br>
4,680,336; 4,889,664, 3,408.429; 3,660,545; 4,113,224; and 4,197,266, all of<br>
which are incorporated by reference in their entirety. In the case of hydrogels,<br>
the ophthalmic lens formulation is a hardened disc that is subjected to a<br>
number of different processing steps including treating the polymerized<br>
ophthalmic lens with liquids (such as water, inorganic salts, or organic<br>
solutions) to swell, or otherwise equilibrate this polymerized ophthalmic lens<br>
prior to enclosing the polymerized ophthalmic lens in its final packaging.<br>
Polymerized ophthalmic lenses that have not been swelled or otherwise<br>
equilibrated are known as un-hydrated polymerized ophthalmic lenses. The<br>
addition of the wetting agent to any of the liquids of this "swelling or<br>
3<br><br>
WO 2006/088758	PCT/US2006/004877<br>
"equilibrating" step at room temperature or below is considered "treating" the<br>
lenses with wetting agents as contemplated by this invention. In addition, the<br>
polymerized un-hydrated ophthalmic lenses may be heated above room<br>
temperature with the wetting agent during swelling or equilibrating steps. The<br>
preferred temperature range is from about 50°C for about 15 minutes to about<br>
sterilization conditions as described below, more preferably from about 50°C to<br>
about 85°C for about 5 minutes.<br>
Yet another method of treating is physically contacting polymerized<br>
ophthalmic lens (either hydrated or un-hydrated) with a wetting agent at<br>
between about room temperature and about 85°C for about 1 minute to about<br>
72 hours, preferably about 24 to about 72 hours, followed by physically<br>
contacting the polymerized ophthalmic lens with a wetting agent at between<br>
about 85°C and 150°C for about 15 minutes to about one hour.<br>
Many ophthalmic lenses are packaged in individual blister packages,<br>
and sealed prior to dispensing the lenses to users. As used herein, these<br>
polymerized lenses are referred to as "hydrated polymerized ophthalmic<br>
lenses". Examples of blister packages and sterilization techniques are<br>
disclosed in the following references which are hereby incorporated by<br>
reference in their entirety, U.S. Pat. Nos. D435.966 S; 4,691,820; 5,467,868;<br>
5,704,468; 5,823,327; 6,050,398, 5,696,686; 6,018,931; 5,577,367; and<br>
5,488,815. This portion of the manufacturing process presents another method<br>
of treating the ophthalmic lenses with wetting agents, namely adding wetting<br>
agents to packaging solution prior to sealing the package, and subsequently<br>
sterilizing the package. This is the preferred method of treating ophthalmic<br>
lenses with wetting agents.<br>
Sterilization can take place at different temperatures and periods of time.<br>
The preferred sterilization conditions range from about 100°C for about 8 hours<br>
to about 150°C for about 0.5 minute. More preferred sterilization conditions<br>
range from about 115°C for about 2.5 hours to about 130°C for about 5.0<br>
minutes. The most preferred sterilization conditions are about 124°C for about<br>
30 minutes.<br>
The "packaging solutions" that are used in methods of this invention may<br>
be water-based solutions. Typical packaging solutions include, without<br>
4<br><br>
WO 2006/088758	PC I7US2006/004877<br>
limitation, saline solutions, other buffered solutions, and deionized water. The<br>
preferred aqueous solution is deioinized water or saline solution containing<br>
salts including, without limitation, sodium chloride, sodium borate, sodium<br>
phosphate, sodium hydrogenphosphate, sodium dihydrogenphosphate, or the<br>
corresponding potassium salts of the same. These ingredients are generally<br>
combined to form buffered solutions that include an acid and its conjugate<br>
base, so that addition of acids and bases cause only a relatively small change<br>
in pH. The buffered solutions may additionally include 2-(N-<br>
morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES), sodium hydroxide, 2,2-<br>
bis(hydroxymethyl)-2,2',2"-nitrilotriethanol, n-tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-2-<br>
aminoethanesulfonic acid, citric acid, sodium citrate, sodium carbonate, sodium<br>
bicarbonate, acetic acid, sodium acetate, ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid and<br>
the like and combinations thereof. Preferably, the packaging solution is a<br>
borate buffered or phosphate buffered saline solution or deionized water. The<br>
particularly preferred packaging solution contains about 1,850 ppm to about<br>
18,500 ppm sodium borate, most particularly preferred about 3,700 ppm of<br>
sodium borate.<br>
As used here, the term "wetting agent" refers polymers having a number<br>
average molecular weight of about at least 500, that impart a moist feeling<br>
when added to the eyes of contact lens wearers. Examples of preferred<br>
wetting agents include but are not limited to poly(meth)acrylamides [i.e.poly<br>
N,N-dimethylacry!amide), poly (N-methylacrylamide) poly (acrylamide),<br>
poly(N-2-hydroxyethylmethacrylamide), and poly(glucosamineacrylamide)],<br>
poly(itaconic acid), hyaluronic acid, xanthan gum, gum Arabic (acacia), starch,<br>
polymers of hydroxylalkyl(meth)acrylates [i.e. poly( 2-<br>
hydroxyethylmethacrylate), poly(2,3-dihydroxypropylmethacrylate, and poly(2-<br>
hydroxyethylacrylate)], and polyvinylpyrrolidone.<br>
Additional preferred wetting agents include but are not limited to co-<br>
polymers and graft co-polymers of the aforementioned preferred wetting<br>
agents, such co-polymers and graft co-polymers include repeating units of<br>
hydrophilic or hydrophobic monomers, preferably in amounts of about less than<br>
ten percent by weight, more preferably less than about two percent. Such<br>
repeating units of hydrophilic or hydrophobic monomers include but are not<br>
5<br><br><br>
WO 2006/088758PCT/US2006/004877<br>
limited to alkenes, styrenes, cyclic N-vinyl amides, acrylamides, hydroxyalkyl<br>
(meth) acrylates, alkyl (meth) acrylates, siloxane substituted acrylates, and<br>
siloxane substituted methacrylates. Specific examples of hydrophilic or<br>
hydrophobic monomers which may be used to form the above co-polymers and<br>
graft co-polymers include but are not limited to ethylene, styrene, N-<br>
vinylpyrrolidone, N,N-dimethylacrylamide, 2-hydroxyethylmethyacrylate, methyl<br>
methacrylate and butyl methacrylate, methacryloxypropyl<br>
tristrimethylsiloxysilane and the like. The preferred repeating units of<br>
hydrophilic or hydrophobic monomers are N-vinylpyrrolidone, N,N-<br>
dimethylacrylamide, 2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate, methyl methacrylate, and<br>
mixtures thereof. Further examples of wetting agents include but are not<br>
limited to polymers with carbon backbones and pendant polyethylene glycol<br>
chains [i.e. polymers of polyethylene glycol monoomethacrylate] copolymers of<br>
ethylene glycol [copolymers with 1,2,propyleneglycol, 1,3-propylene glycol,<br>
methyleneglycol, and tetramethylene glycol]. The preferred wetting agents are<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone, graft co-polymers and co-polymers of polyvinylpyrrolidone,<br>
the particularly preferred wetting agent is polyvinylpyrrolidone.<br>
Polyvinylpyrrolidone ("PVP") is the polymerization product of N-vinyipyrrolidone.<br>
PVP is available in a variety of molecular weights from about 500 to about<br>
6,000,000 Daltons. These molecular weights can be expressed in term of K-<br>
values, based on kinematic viscosity measurements as described in<br>
Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and Engineering, John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc, and<br>
will be expressed in these numbers throughout this application. The use of<br>
PVP having the following K-values from about K-30 to about K-120 is<br>
contemplated by this invention. The more preferred K-values are about K-60 to<br>
about K-100, most preferably about K-80 to about K-100. For the treatment of<br>
etafilcon A lenses, the particularly preferred K-value of PVP is about K-80 to<br>
about K-95, more preferably about K-85 to about K-95, most preferably about<br>
K-90.<br>
The wetting agents can be added to the packaging solution at a variety<br>
of different concentrations such as about 100 ppm to about 150,000 ppm. For<br>
example if the wetting agents are added to packaging solutions containing un-<br>
hydrated polymerized ophthalmic lenses, the wetting agents are preferably<br>
6<br><br>
WO 2006/088758	PCT/US2006/004877<br>
present at a concentration of about 30,000 ppm to about 150,000 ppm. If the<br>
wetting agents are added to packaging solutions containing hydrated<br>
polymerized ophthalmic lenses, the wetting agents are preferably present at a<br>
concentration of about 100 ppm, to about 3000 ppm, more preferably about<br>
200 ppm to about 1000 ppm, most preferably less than about 500 ppm. For<br>
example when etafilcon A lenses are used in this invention and the wetting<br>
agent is K-90 PVP, the preferred packaging solution concentration of PVP K-90<br>
is about 250ppm to about 2,500 ppm, more preferably about 300 to about 500<br>
ppm, most preferably about 350 to about 440 ppm.<br>
When etafilcon A contact lenses are heated with K-90 PVP at a<br>
temperature greater than about 120°C for about 30 minutes at a concentration<br>
of about 400 to about 500 ppm, the treated lenses are more comfortable to<br>
users than untreated lenses. Further, this particular molecular weight and<br>
concentration of PVP does not distort or shift the diameter of the lenses during<br>
the treatment cycle or distort the users vision. While not wishing to be bound<br>
by any particular mechanism of incorporation, it is known that K-90 PVP is<br>
incorporated into the matrix of the lens after it is treated with K-90 PVP.  In an<br>
etafilcon A contact lens, the preferred amount of incorporated K-90 PVP is<br>
about 0.01 mg to about 1.0 mg, more preferred about 0.10 mg to about 0.30<br>
mg, most particularly preferred about 0.10 mg to about 0.20 mg. Lenses that<br>
have been treated in this manner are worn by users for up to 12 hours still<br>
maintain the incorporated PVP.<br>
Further the invention includes an ocular device comprising, consisting<br>
essentially of, or consisting of a polymerized ophthalmic lens wherein said<br>
polymerized ophthalmic lens is treated with a wetting agent, provided that the<br>
ophthalmic lens formulation does not comprise said wetting agent prior to its<br>
polymerization. The terms "ophthalmic lens," "wetting agent," "polymerized,"<br>
and "formulation" all have their aforementioned meanings and preferred<br>
ranges. The term "treated" has the equivalent meaning and preferred ranges<br>
as the term treating.<br>
Still further the invention includes an ocular device prepared by treating<br>
a polymerized ophthalmic lens with a wetting agent, provided that the<br>
ophthalmic lens formulation does not comprise said wetting agent prior to its<br>
7<br><br><br>
WO 2006/088758PCT/US2006/004877<br>
polymerization. The terms "ophthalmic lens," "wetting agent," "polymerized,"<br>
"treated" and "formulation" all have their aforementioned meanings and<br>
preferred ranges.<br>
The application of the invention is described in further detail by use of<br>
the following examples. These examples are not meant to limit the invention,<br>
only to illustrate its use. Other modifications that are considered to be within<br>
the scope of the invention, and will be apparent to those of the appropriate skill<br>
level in view of the foregoing text and following examples.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1<br>
Cured etafilcon A contact lenses (sold as 1-Day Acuvue® brand contact<br>
lenses by Johnson &amp; Johnson Vision Care, Inc.) were equilibrated in deionized<br>
water, and packaged in solutions containing PVP in borate buffered saline<br>
solution ((lOOOmL, sodium chloride 3.55g, sodium borate 1.85 g, boric acid<br>
9.26 g, and ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid 0.1 g: 5 rinses over 24 hours,<br>
950 + uL), sealed with a foil lid stock, and sterilized (121°C, 30 minutes).<br>
Before the addition of PVP each solution contained water, l000mL, sodium<br>
chloride 3.55g, sodium borate 1.85 g, boric acid, 9.26 g, and ethylenediamine<br>
tetraacetic acid 0.1g. A variety of different weights and concentrations of PVP<br>
were used as shown in Table 1, below<br>
The amount of PVP that is incorporated into each lens is determined by<br>
removing the lenses from the packaging solution and extracting them with a<br>
mixture 1:1 mixture of N,N-dimethylforamide, (DMF) and deionized water (Dl).<br>
The extracts are evaluated by high performance liquid chromatography<br>
(HPLC). Three lenses were used for each evaluation. The results and their<br>
standard deviation are presented in Table 1.<br>

Samples of treated etafilcon A lenses were prepared via the treatment<br>
and sterilization methods of Example 1 from K-12, K-30, K-60, K-90, and K-120<br>
PVP at concentrations of 0.30%, 1.65%, and 3.00%. After sterilization, the<br>
diameter of the lenses was, compared to an untreated lens and evaluated to<br>
determine if the process changed those diameters. The results, Figure 1, plot<br>
the change in diameter vs the type of PVP at a particular concentration. This<br>
data shows that K-12, K-90, and K-120 have a minimal effect on the diameter<br>
of the lenses.<br>
Example 3<br>
Several etafilcon A lenses were treated with K-90 PVP at a<br>
concentration of 500 ppm and sterilized according to the methods of Example<br>
1. The lenses were stored in their packages for approximately 28 days at room<br>
temperature and were then measured for diameter, base curve, sphere power,<br>
and center thickness. Thereafter, lenses were heated at 55°C for one month.<br>
The diameter, base curve, sphere power, and center thickness of the lenses<br>
was measured and the results were evaluated against an untreated lens and<br>
data is presented in Table 2. This data illustrates that the parameters of lenses<br>
treated with K-90 PVP are not significantly affected by time at elevated<br>
temperature.<br>

Example 5<br>
Etafilcon A lenses were prepared according to Example 1 at the<br>
concentrations of Table 1. The treated lenses were clinically evaluated in a<br>
double-masked studies of between 9 and 50 patients. The patients wore the<br>
lenses in both eyes for 3-4 days with overnight removal and daily replacement,<br>
and wore untreated 1-Day Acuvue® brand contact lenses for 3-4 days with<br>
overnight removal and daily replacement as a control. Patients were not<br>
allowed to use rewetting drops with either type of lens. Patients were asked to<br>
rate the lens using a questionnaire. All patients were asked a series of<br>
questions relating to overall preference, comfort preference, end of day<br>
preference, and dryness. In their answers they were asked to distinguish if<br>
they preferred the treated lens, the 1-Day control lens, both lenses or neither<br>
lens. The results are shown in Tables 4 and 5. The numbers in the columns<br>
represent the percentage of patients that positively responded to each of the<br>
four options. The "n" number represents the number of patients for a particular<br>
sample type. "DNT" means did not test and n/a means non applicable. The<br>
numbers illustrate that lenses treated with K-90 PVP at a concentration of<br>
about 500 ppm have good clinical comfort on the eye. The sample # refers to<br>

Example 6<br>
An etafilcon A contact lens was treated with 500ppm of K-90 PVP using<br>
the methods of Example 1. The treated lenses were briefly rinsed with<br>
phosphate buffered saline solution and rinsed lenses were placed in the well of<br>
a cell culture cluster container (Cellgrow XL) that mimics the dimensions of a<br>
human eye. See, Farris RL, Tear Analysis in Contact Lens Wears, Tr. Am.<br>
Opth. Soc. Vol. LXXXIII, 1985. Four hundred microliters of phosphate buffered<br>
saline solution (KH2PO4 0.20 g/L, KCI- 0.20 g/L, NaCI 8.0 g/L, Na2HPO4<br>
[anhydrous] 1.15 g/L) was added to each container. The wells were covered<br>
and the container was stored in an oven at 35°C.<br>
Three lenses were removed from the oven at various times and<br>
analyzed by HPLC to determine whether PVP was released into the phosphate<br>
buffered saline solution. The average results are presented in Table 6. The<br>
limit of quantification for PVP is 20 ppm. The test did not detect any PVP in the<br>
analyzed samples. This data shows that PVP is not released at levels greater<br>
than 20ppm.<br>
