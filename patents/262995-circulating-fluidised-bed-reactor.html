				<td>MODULAR FLUIDISED BED REACTOR<br>
The present invention relates to circulating fluidised bed reactors for reacting<br>
solid gases and producing energy and to boilers.<br>
These reactors comprise a reaction chamber where the solid gas reactions take<br>
place, a centrifugal separator with the means for re-circulating the solids to the bottom<br>
of the reaction chamber and, typically, a heat exchanger or means of regulating the<br>
temperature in the reaction chamber.<br>
To simplify things, only a description of the state-of-the-art circulating<br>
fluidised bed boiler will be provided in this application.<br>
The boilers comprise a hearth for burning the fuel, a centrifugal separator with<br>
the means to re-circulate the solids to the bottom of the hearth and at least one heat<br>
exchanger to regulate the temperature in the reaction chamber.<br>
Controlling the greenhouse gas emissions, such as CO2 for example, is an<br>
unavoidable technical constraint for the energy producing stations using fossil fuels.<br>
This control means that new problems have to be overcome at minimum cost and<br>
impact, such as capturing the CO2 in the fumes emitted from the stations or using<br>
renewable biomass type energy (non fossil carbon).<br>
Finally, the gradual rarefaction of oil deposits makes it more urgent to<br>
implement large-scale recovery technologies assisted by injecting CO2, which can<br>
more than double some of the accessible reserves.<br>
Already known is the conversion of solid fuels containing carbon materials, by<br>
way of thermo-chemical combustion to produce combustion fumes containing<br>
essentially CO2 and H2O without nitrogen ballast, so that these fumes can be used in<br>
the assisted recovery of oil or to be able to confine these fumes underground, as<br>
proposed in the techniques for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.<br>
With this approach, there is no need to have recourse to a specific air<br>
distillation unit to produce the oxygen, which entails a high consumption of electrical<br>
energy.<br>
This conversion is carried out by two circulating fluidised bed reactors: an<br>
oxidation reactor and a conversion reactor. These are connected together to produce<br>
the exchange of solid metallic oxides, which act as oxygen carriers before they are<br>
successively reduced and then oxidised in the loop.<br>
2<br><br>
This interconnection is a major constraint in the arrangement of the two<br>
reactors, the respective size of which differs by a ratio of 1 to 3, or even 1 to 4, owing<br>
to the separation of the nitrogen thinner, also referred to as "nitrogen ballast" and to<br>
the recycling of CO2 / H2O / SO2 in the conversion reactor. Each reactor comprises, in<br>
fact, three elements to ensure operation: an actual reactor or reaction chamber, a<br>
cyclone or separator linked to a siphon and a rear boiler, also referred to as the rear<br>
cage, which has to be combined reciprocally and to which are added the exterior beds<br>
on the oxidation reactor and a carbon separator / stripper, also known as a "carbon<br>
stripper" in the solids return line from the conversion reactor to the oxidation reactor.<br>
However, it is necessary to have a concept that can be extrapolated for large<br>
sizes of 20 to 400 MWe approximately and which minimises the solids connection<br>
sheaths between the two reactors.<br>
Finally, one must also underline the constraint produced by the use of solid<br>
refractory materials since conventionally, the conversion reactor is fully clad with<br>
refractory materials or "refractorised" over its loop (reactor, sheath, cyclone, siphon)<br>
whilst the conversion reactor is only coated with refractory materials on its bottom<br>
section and on the sheath, cyclone and siphon. These loop elements have sheet metal<br>
protection and a multi-layer refractory coating of 400 to 500 mm. This entails high<br>
maintenance costs and operating constraints in that start-up and shut-down take<br>
longer, in order to accommodate these vast thicknesses with a limited thermal<br>
gradient.<br>
Considering the above constraints, it would appear that designing such a boiler<br>
with an integral and compact arrangement that can be extrapolated, in order to<br>
produce the functions required, would be a formidable problem to overcome.<br>
The applicant of the present application has also perfected application No.<br>
PCT WO 2004/036118. This latter application describes, in particular, a basic module<br>
comprising a reaction chamber or reactor, a separator and rear cage, where the<br>
reaction chamber and separator have straight walls.<br>
Conventionally, the reaction chamber is placed in front of the separator, which<br>
in turn is positioned in front of the rear cage. This solution is, in fact, the most logical<br>
since the fumes produced by the reaction chamber pass through the separator with the<br>
particles returning to the chamber, whilst the remainder of the fumes is processed in<br>
the rear cage. The separator is located in the centre between the reaction chamber and<br>
rear cage, thereby minimising the connection sheaths between these elements.<br>
3<br><br>
The purpose of the present invention is to propose a configuration which is<br>
compact, modular and especially adapted to the design of a double boiler with<br>
fluidised beds, with interconnections so as to guarantee the exchange of the oxygen-<br>
carrying oxides, which are successively reduced before becoming oxidised in the loop<br>
in order to capture the CO2.<br>
The fluidised bed reactor according to the invention comprises a reaction<br>
chamber linked to a centrifugal separator by way of an acceleration sheath, for<br>
purposes of separating particles from the hot gases coming from said reaction<br>
chamber, with the whole assembly comprising the reaction chamber, separator and<br>
rear cage, making up the basic module. This is characterised in that it comprises at<br>
least two modules, one where the reaction chamber is positioned between the<br>
separator and rear cage and the other where the separator is positioned between the<br>
reactor and the rear cage. The advantage of this arrangement compared with what is<br>
conventionally deployed, is the ability to position the separator of each of these<br>
modules alongside the reaction chamber of the other module, which may be<br>
advantageous for some configurations where the particles pass from one reaction<br>
chamber to the other through the separator, with the rear cage being common to both.<br>
The combination of a conventional module with central separator and a module with a<br>
central reactor mean that the distance between the separators and reaction chambers is<br>
thus reduced, as is also the length of the piping between these different elements. The<br>
number of modules to be used is calculated on the basis of the power required.<br>
According to a special arrangement, part of the acceleration sheath is arranged<br>
at least in the top section of the reaction chamber. The centrifugal separator has<br>
virtually straight, vertical walls. The position of the acceleration sheath for the<br>
particles in the reaction chamber means that it is possible to combine or even have one<br>
common wall between the said chamber and separator, thereby increasing the overall<br>
available volume. The fact that the sheath is incorporated at least in the top section of<br>
each reactor, as described in patent WO 2204/036118, means that the solids escaping<br>
through the separators are now reduced to a minimum.<br>
According to a particular characteristic, the walls are common. The use of<br>
common walls for each reactor, separator and rear cage assembly unit now makes it<br>
possible to obtain an aligned and compact arrangement.<br>
According to another arrangement, the rear cage of the two types of module<br>
has a common wall. The rear cages are placed side by side and can have common<br>
4<br><br>
walls with the separator or reactor, depending on configuration. It is therefore possible<br>
to retain tubed walls, which are easy to build, and to install sweepers to clean off any<br>
dust deposits on the tubes, leaving a sufficiently small space, so as to minimise the<br>
risk of solid deposits settling between the adjacent separator, owing to the fact that the<br>
fumes no longer need to flow through long connecting pipes.<br>
According to another arrangement, the reactor and separator have a common<br>
wall. The reactor can be of a square or rectangular shape.<br>
According to a further arrangement, the reactor and rear cage have a common<br>
wall. The exterior bed may be located under the rear cage and be connected to the<br>
oxidation reactor it supplies through the corresponding siphon.<br>
According to another arrangement, the separator and rear cage have a common<br>
wall.<br>
According to a particular characteristic, the common walls between the<br>
reactors and between the separators and rear cages are doubled and comprise<br>
stiffening belts in the space between the double walls. For very large boilers, above<br>
200 MWe, it may be necessary - not only on account of thermal expansion of the<br>
assembly comprising the reactors, separators and rear cages, but also on account of<br>
the excessive size of the belts retaining the internal pressure reactors - to double up on<br>
some of the walls.<br>
According to one variant, at least one of the modules comprises an oxidation<br>
reactor and the other a conversion reactor. In such cases the circulating fluidised beds<br>
of each boiler are connected together to guarantee the exchange of solid, metallic<br>
oxides carrying the oxygen, which are successively reduced and oxidised in the loops<br>
in order to produce a concentrated current of CO2, which is deprived of any nitrogen<br>
ballast. The reverse arrangement of the oxidation reactor and conversion reactor with<br>
their respective separator makes it possible to juxtapose respectively, the separator of<br>
the oxidation reactor with the conversion reactor and the separator of the conversion<br>
reactor with the oxidation reactor. A siphon is arranged under each separator: a siphon<br>
with two outlets under the separator of the conversion reactor, with one outlet<br>
providing the direct return to a conversion reactor and the other to supply the<br>
oxidation reactor with solids, and a siphon with two or three outlets under the<br>
oxidation reactor to guarantee the direct return to the oxidation reactor and to supply<br>
the conversion reactor and exterior beds with solids. This arrangement of the reactors<br>
5<br><br>
allows for the use of particularly short sheaths, thus avoiding the use of long, fluidised<br>
sheaths that are slightly inclined and suitable for defluidisation.<br>
According to another particular arrangement of the above variant, the<br>
oxidation reactor comprises at least twice as many modules as the conversion reactor.<br>
The principle of extrapolating the size is by maintaining a module with the conversion<br>
reactor and at the very least, two modules with the oxidation reactor, followed by<br>
extrapolating the size of the reactor section until the equivalent of a unit flow rate of<br>
100 MWe is obtained and by adding in the order of up to four aligned modules. The<br>
structure of the basic modules of the oxidation reactor, whose top section is a multiple<br>
of that of the conversion reactor, a multiple three or four, results in a section for each<br>
separator equal to that of each reactor. Hence, the oxidation reactor, which is bigger,<br>
is all of one piece over its bottom section, whilst the top part is segmented by tubed<br>
division walls, where the tubes form an integral part with the inlet or acceleration<br>
sheaths of the separators and thus comprises the corresponding section of the basic<br>
module.<br>
According to a particular arrangement of the above variant, the conversion<br>
reactor is located between the separator and rear cage.<br>
According to another variant, at least one of the modules comprises a CO2<br>
absorption reactor with said CO2 contained in the fumes following carbonation of<br>
CaO and the other comprises a cracking reactor of the CaCC&gt;3 carbonates. In the latter<br>
case, the CaO lime undergoes cycles of carbonation and decarbonation. The calcium<br>
oxide is successively carbonated by the absorption of CO2 and decarbonated by<br>
cracking.<br>
This highly integral design allows for the use of:<br>
-	interior beds<br>
-	top division walls, in addition to the cyclone inlet or acceleration sheaths,<br>
which facilitate the separation of solids and heat exchange inside the<br>
oxidation reactor<br>
-	common cooling walls that combine the water vapour emulsion with the<br>
slightly overheated steam<br>
-	forced circulation or otherwise for the super-critical steam cycles.<br>
On the other hand this concept reduces the weight of the parts under pressure<br>
thanks to the common walls and reduction of the thickness of the refractory coating of<br>
6<br><br>
approx. 25 to 50 mm along the periphery of the tube. The low thermal flow present in<br>
the conversion and oxidation reactors allows the water vapour emulsion, for example,<br>
to flow at a low mass flow rate, whilst the walls of the separators have low-<br>
temperature overheated steam passing along them.<br>
The invention will be better understood when reading the following<br>
description, which is provided purely as an example and which refers to the enclosed<br>
drawings, where:<br>
Figure 1 is a top view of a module according to an initial variant<br>
Figure 2 is a top view of a module according to a second variant<br>
Figure 3 is a top view of a combination of modules according to the invention<br>
Figure 4 is a schematic diagram of an installation, for installing the modules<br>
according to the invention<br>
Figure 5 is a schematic diagram of a second variant of the invention.<br>
The module depicted in figure 1 comprises a reactor 1, a separator 2 located<br>
alongside and a rear cage 3, with the assembly being held together by metallic<br>
structures 4. This module corresponds to that described in patent application WO<br>
2004/036118 of the applicant. Reactor 1 is connected to the separator by a sheath 10,<br>
which is partially or completely incorporated in said reactor 1. Reactor 1 has a<br>
common wall 11 with the separator 2 and a common wall 12 with the rear cage 3.<br>
Said walls are tubed with heat-conducting fluid running through them. The separator 2<br>
has a solids outlet 20 connected to a siphon 5 that discharges to reactor 1. The fumes<br>
leave separator 2 and pass to the rear cage 3 by way of a sheath (not shown). The<br>
bottom of the hearth 1 comprises an area with a fluidisation grille 40.<br>
The module depicted in figure 2 also comprises a reactor 1, a separator 2 and a<br>
rear cage 3. However, here, the reactor 1 is located at the centre between separator 2<br>
and the rear cage 3. The separator 2 has a common wall 11 with reactor 1 and a<br>
common wall 21 with the rear cage 3. The solids - as shown in Figure 1 - pass via the<br>
outlet 20 before going through the siphon 5 and then returning to reactor 1. The fumes<br>
pass from the separator 2 to the rear cage 3 by a sheath (not shown). The bottom of<br>
the hearth 1 comprises an area with a fluidisation grille 40.<br>
The combination of the two types of modules depicted in Figures 1 and 2 is<br>
particularly well suited to execute a double circulating fluidised bed boiler, which can<br>
be connected up to capture the CO2. This particular embodiment is depicted in figures<br>
3 and 4.<br>
7<br><br>
Figure 4 shows, in diagrammatic form, a double incorporated boiler<br>
comprising the following elements:<br>
-	two circulating fluidised bed reactors la and lb, of which one is an<br>
oxidation reactor la and the other a conversion reactor lb, which are<br>
connected together for exchanging the oxygen-carrying solid metallic<br>
oxides, which are successively reduced before becoming oxidised in the<br>
two reactors la and lb.<br>
-	two separators, 2a and 2b<br>
-	two siphons 5a and 5b respectively located under the separators 2a and 2b<br>
-	an exterior bed 6 connected to the oxidation reactor 1 a<br>
-	a carbon sorting separator referred to as a carbon stripper 7, located on the<br>
solids return line from the conversion reactor lb to the oxidation reactor<br>
la.<br>
-	two rear cages 3a and 3b<br>
-	two silos 8a and 8b for the solid fuel<br>
-	two filters 9a and 9b, a fan 90b, a cooling and condensation circuit 91b and<br>
an ash separator 92b.<br>
The siphon 5a arranged under the separator 2a has three solid outlets - one for<br>
the direct return to the oxidation reactor la, one to supply the conversion reactor lb<br>
with solids and one to supply the exterior bed 6 that controls the loop temperature,<br>
with solids.<br>
The siphon 5b located under the separator 2b has two solid outlets, one for the<br>
direct return of the solids to the conversion reactor lb and one to supply the oxidation<br>
reactor la with solids. It is also possible to dedicate each siphon to supplying one of<br>
the exterior beds or to supplying one of the conversion reactors.<br>
Figure 3 depicts the arrangement of the modules to execute the double boiler<br>
according to the invention. The double boiler comprises elementary modules, with<br>
said elementary modules being dimensioned so that one of the dimensions of the<br>
conversion reactor lb - i.e. the width or length - is equal to the characteristic<br>
dimension - i.e. width or length - of separator 2a. The number of elementary<br>
modules to be used is calculated in relation to the power required for each reactor 1 a<br>
and lb. At least two, three or even four times more are required for the oxidation<br>
reactor la than for the conversion reactor lb. This will provide the arrangement<br>
8<br><br>
according to Figure 3. The conversion reactor lb is located between the separator 2b ,<br>
and the rear cage 3b. There is a common wall with one of the separators 2a, whilst<br>
separator 2b has a common wall with reactor la.<br>
As can be seen from Figure 3, the oxidation reactor la is made up of at least<br>
two identical modules and therefore comprises at least two identical cells. Its top<br>
section, roughly 10 m above the fluidisation grille 30, is divided up into sections by<br>
tubular walls 13a, where the tubes form an integral part of the inlet sheaths 10a of the<br>
separator 2a. The bottom section comprises one single part.<br>
The conversion reactor lb is reversed compared with the oxidation reactor la<br>
and its respective separators 2a and 2b are respectively juxtaposed by their common<br>
walls 1 la and 1 lb with the reactors la and lb and by the walls 14a and 14b with<br>
reactors la and lb.<br>
As can be seen from Figures 1,2 and 3, the walls are virtually straight,<br>
meaning that it is possible to have common walls 11, 12, 13, 14a, 14b and 30 between<br>
the basic aligned modules. All these walls are tubed, meaning that it is possible to use<br>
thinner refractory linings of approx. 25 to 50 mm on the crown of the tube. The<br>
exothermal oxidation reactor la is protected by a thin refractory lining along the<br>
bottom section and in the sheath section 10a, as is also the separator 2a and siphon 5a.<br>
As for the endothermal conversion reactor lb, its height is fully protected by a thin<br>
insulating refractory layer, as is also the sheath 10b, the separator 2b and siphon 5b.<br>
The rear cages 3a are juxtaposed by walls 21a that are common to the<br>
separators 2a and by walls 30 common to the rear cage 3b. The rear cage 3b also has a<br>
wall 12b that is common to the conversion reactor lb.<br>
An exterior bed 6 that can be seen in Figures 3 and 4 is placed alongside the<br>
oxidation reactor la and is located under the separators 2a. It can also be arranged<br>
under the rear cage 3a. It is fed from siphon 5a. The use of the interior bed (not<br>
shown), tubed walls of the top divisions 13a and the internal exchangers (not shown)<br>
in the oxidation reactor la make it possible to minimise, where necessary, the size of<br>
the exterior bed and hence reduce its costs. In fact, internal fluidisation and the<br>
internal heat exchangers allow for the absorption of kilowatts.<br>
We shall now briefly describe the operation of the unit with double reactor<br>
(oxidation and conversion).<br>
The two, circulating fluidised bed reactors - the oxidation reactor la and the<br>
conversion reactor lb - are connected together to allow for the exchange of oxygen-<br>
9<br><br>
carrying, solid, metallic oxides, which are successively reduced and oxidated in the<br>
loop. The oxygen that is released in the conversion reactor 1 b ensures combustion,<br>
without nitrogen, of the carbonated fuel introduced in said reactor lb. The combustion<br>
products (C02, S02, H2O) from the conversion reactor lb, fluidised by recycled CO2,<br>
SO2, H2O, are loaded as solids, which are separated in the separator 2b and re-<br>
introduced to the bottom of the reactor la via a siphon 5b. These combustion products<br>
are then cooled down again in a rear cage 3b, the dust is removed and they are then<br>
transferred to a CO2 compression train for subsequent storage.<br>
The reduced state solid, metallic oxides leaving the conversion reactor lb are<br>
then transferred to the oxidation reactor 1 a after undergoing a carbon stripping or<br>
carbon separation stage 7.<br>
The oxidation reactor la is fluidised in air, which reacts with the oxides and<br>
conveys them to the top of the oxidation reactor la where the air, now deprived of<br>
oxygen, is loaded in solids, which then undergo separation in the separator 2a before<br>
being re-introduced to the base of the reactor la via a siphon 5a. This air, which is<br>
deprived of oxygen and CO2 is cooled down in a rear cage 3a, where the dust is<br>
extracted and vented to atmosphere by a conventional flue.<br>
Regarding the very large boilers of more than 200 MWe, it may be necessary,<br>
not only for reasons of thermal expansion of the assembly unit comprising reactors,<br>
separators and rear cages but also because of the excessive size of the belts<br>
maintaining the reactors at the internal pressure, to double certain walls, as shown in<br>
figure 3, - for example, wall 12b and walls 30,14b and 14a. The overall arrangement<br>
is somewhat modified by this inter-wall spacing of approx. 800 mm.<br>
As can be seen from Figure 5, it is possible to use the invention to execute<br>
another type of CO2 capturing process according to patent FR 2 814 533 of the<br>
applicant, which can be used at 650°C approx. on a current of fumes from the boiler<br>
hearth 100. To simplify things, the same elements will be given the same references<br>
with a "prime" index<br>
In such a case, the reactor 1 'a is used as an absorber of the CO2 contained in<br>
the fumes, of CaO lime that is carbonated by the absorption of CO2 to replace the<br>
oxygen-carrying metallic oxides of the previous example. The solids extracted from<br>
reactor 1 'a (CaO, CaCCh, CaSC) are transferred to the reactor 1 'b, in which the<br>
formed carbonates undergo cracking. The CO2 released is likewise cooled, filtered<br>
10<br><br>
and compressed. The CaO cracked in reactor 1 'b is transferred to reactor 1 'a for<br>
renewed CO2 capture following cooling to 600°C in bed 7'.<br>
In a more detailed manner, the two circulating fluidised bed reactors - the<br>
absorption reactor 1 'a and the cracking reactor 1 'b - are connected together to ensure<br>
the exchange of calcium compounds acting as carbonate carriers and which are<br>
successively carbonated and cracked in the loop by raising the temperature to 900°C<br>
in reactor 1 'a through the injection of fuel and diluted oxygen into the CO2. The<br>
combustion products (CO2, SO2, H2O) from the conversion reactor 1 'b, which are<br>
fluidised by a mixture of O2 and recycled CO2 / SO2 / H2O, are loaded as solids, which<br>
undergo separation in separator 2'b before being re-introduced to the bottom of the<br>
reactor Ta via a siphon 5'b. These combustion products are then cooled down in a<br>
rear cage 3'b, de-dusted and transferred to a CO2 compression train for subsequent<br>
storage.<br>
The calcium compounds in the CaO state, leaving the conversion reactor 1 'b,<br>
are then transferred to the absorption reactor 1 'a after having undergone a cooling<br>
stage from 900°C to 600°C approx. in the cooling bed 7'.<br>
The absorption reactor 1 'a is fluidised by the fumes containing the CO2<br>
undergoing treatment, which reacts with the calcium compounds and which conveys<br>
them to the top of the absorption reactor 1 'a. These fumes, with impoverished CO2<br>
content, are loaded as solids, which are separated in the separator 2'a and re-<br>
introduced to the bottom of reactor 1'a via a siphon 5'a. These fumes, which have an<br>
impoverished CO2 content are cooled in a rear cage 3'a, de-dusted and rejected to<br>
atmosphere in a conventional flue.<br>
