Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of (4S,6S)-4-(ethy]amino)-5,6-dihydro-6-methyl-4H-tliieno[2,3-b]thiopyran-2-sulfonamide-7,7-dio\ide hydrochloride having formula \_.<br><br>
The compound of formula 1 has adopted name "Dorzolamide hydrochloride". Dorzolamide hydrochloride is prepared by the process of the present invention with high chemical and diastereomeric purity. The present invention also relates to novel intermediate of the formula 20 and a process for its preparation.<br><br>
The novel intermediate of formula 20 is used in preparation of Dorzolamide hydrochloride having formula .1. Dorzolamide hydrochloride is useful in the treatment of ocular hypertension by inhibiting carbonic anhydrase enzyme. Background of the Invention<br>
The process for preparation of Dorzolamide hydrochloride was first reported in EP 296879 (Equivalent to US 4797413). This patent discloses the preparation of Dorzolamide hydrochloride of the formula 1 starting from 2-mercaptothiophene of the formula 2, by reacting with crotonic acid to form 3-(2-mercaptothiophene)butanoic acid of the formula 3. The compound of the formula 3 is reacted with oxalyl chloride and followed by cyclisation with stannic chloride to obtain 5,6-dihydro-4H-6-methyIthieno[2,3-b]thiopyran-4-one of the formula 4. The compound of the formula 4 is reacted with acetic anhydride and sulfuric acid to obtain 5,6-dihydro-4H-6-methylthieno[2,3-bJlhiupyran-4-one-2-sulfonic acid of the formula 5. The compound of the formula 5 is reacted with phosphorous pentachloride to obtain the 5,6-dihydro-4H-6-methylthieno[2,3-b] thiopyran-4-one-2-sulfonyIchloride of the formula 6 and then followed by treating with ammonia gives 5,6-dihydro-4H-6-methylthieno[2,3-b]thiopyran-4-one-2-sulfonamide the formula 7. Reduction of compound of the formula 7 using sodium borohydride gives 5,6-dihydro-4H-4-hydroxy-6-methylthieno[2,3-b]thiopyran-2-sulfonamide of the formula 8. Oxidation of the compound of die formula 8 using oxone provides 5,6-dihydro-4H-4-hydroxy-6-methyIthieno[2,3-b]thiopyran-2-sulfonamide'7,7-dioxide of the formula 9. The compound of the formula 9 is reacted with acetonitrile and sulfuric acid by Ritter reaction to results in 5,6-dihydro-4H-4-acetylamino-6-methylthieno[2,3-b]thiopyran-2-sulfonamide-7,7-dioxide of   the formula 10. Reduction of the compound of the formula 10 using<br><br>
borane-dimethyl sulfide       gives       5,6-dihydro-4H-4-ethylaim'no-6-metriylmieno[2,3-b]t]iiopyi'aii-2-su!fonamide-7,7-dioxide of the formula 1_1.<br>
The racemic cis/trans isomer of the formula 11, on separation by column chromatography gives the pure (Â±)trans 5,6-dihydro-4H-4-ethylamino-6-methyIthieno[2,3-b]thiopyran-2-sulfonamide-7,7-dioxjde of the formula 12- This trans isomer of the formula 12 on resolution using di-p-toluoyl-D-tartaric acid and di-p-toluoyl-L-tartaric acid, followed by treating with hydrochloric acid provides Dorzolamide hydrochloride of the formula 1 as described in the Scheme-1.<br><br>
The above prior art process has the following disadvantages when the process is to be scaled-up for industrial use:<br>
(a)	The starting material 2-mercaptothiphene of the formula 2 is highly expensive and it also tends to<br>
oxidize to form disulfide during storage and transportation. It also has the disadvantage of handling as<br>
it gives pungent smell in the pure form and it is very difficult to handle in the large scale.<br>
(b)	The separation of Cis/trans isomer of the formula 11 was done by column chromatography which is very cumbersome and inconvenient for industries and also purity of trans isomer after column chromatography has not been reported.<br>
(c)	The resolution of racemic trans isomeric Dorzolamide of the formula _12 to Dorzolamide hydrochloride of the formula 1 had been done using both di-p-toluoyl-L-tartaric acid and di-p-toluoyl-<br><br>
D-tartaric acid and isolating required isomer which is very long process and not suitable for plant<br>
operation and large scale production.<br>
(d) The overall yield is reported to be around 5% from 2-mercaptothiphene of the formula 2.<br>
Another process for the preparation of Dorzolamide Hydrochloride are described in US 5688968 starting from chiral hydroxysulfone ie., 5,6-dihydro-4-(S)-hydroxy-6(S)-methyl-4H-thiopyran-7,7,-dioxide of the formula J3. The 5,6-dihydro-4(S)-hydroxy-6(S)-methylthieno[2,3-b]thiopyran-7,7,-dioxide of the formula 13 is reacted with acetonitrile and sulfuric acid by Ritter reaction to obtain 5,6-dihydro-4(S)-acetylamino-6(S)-methyIthieno[2,3-b]thiopyran-7,7,-dioxide of the formula _14. The compound of the formula M is reacted with chlorosulfontc acid and thionyl chloride to give 5,6-dihydro-4(S)-acelylamino-6(S)-methylthieno[2,3-b]thiopyran-2-suffonylchloride-7,7,-dioxide of the formula 15 and followed by treating with ammonia to obtain 5,6-dihydro-4(S)-acetylamino-6(S)-meUiyHhieno[2,3-b]tliiopyran-2-sulfonamide-7,7,-dioxide of the formula Ij6. Reduction of the compound of formula .16 using borontrifluoride-etherate in sodium borohydride to obtain 5,6-dihydro-4(S)-ethylamino-6(S)-methylthieno[2,3-b]thiopyran-2-su!fon amide-7,7,-dioxide of the formula \1_. The compound of formula 11_ is treated with maleic acid to obtain trans 5,6-dihydro-4(S)-ethylamino-6(S)-methylthieno[2,3-b]thiopyran-2-sulfon amide-7,7^-Hioxide maleate of the formula ljt. The compound of formula 18 is treated with sodium bicarbonate and hydrochloric acid to obtain Dorzolamide hydrochloride of the formula I as described in the Scheme-2.<br><br>
The process for making the chiral hydroxysulfone of the formula .13 is described in EP 0590549, EP 658211, US 5391772, US 5474919 and US 5760249. The above described process is not suitable for industrial product production as the process of making is cumbersome and involves enzymatic process.<br>
Further US 7109353 described the process for the preparation of Dorzolamide hydrochloride from 2-bromothiophene of the formula 19.    The compound of the formula 19 is reacted with<br><br>
magnesium, sulphur and crotonic acid to obtain 3-(2-mercaptothiophene)butanoic acid of the formula 3. The compound of the formula Â£ is reacted with thionyl chloride and followed by cyclisation with stannic chloride to obtain 5,6-dihydro-4H-6-methylthieno[2,3-b]thiopyran-4-one of the formula 4. The compound of the formula 4 is reacted with chlorosulfonic acid and thionyl chloride to obtain 5,6-dihydro-4H-6-methylthieno[2,3-b]thiopyran-4-one-2-sulfonyIchloride of the formula 6 and followed by treating with ammonia gives 5,6-dihydro-4H-6-methylthieno[2,3-b]thiopyran-4-one-2-sulfonamide the formula 7. Reduction of the compound of the formula 2 using sodium borohydride to obtain 5,6-dihydro-4H-4-hydroxy-6-methyltl?ieno[2,3-b]thiopyran-2-sulfonamide of the formula 8. Oxidation of the compound of the formula 8 using sodium perborate provides 5,6-dihydro-4H-4-hydroxy-6-metliyilhieiio[2,3-b]thiopyran-2-su|fonamide-7,7-dioxide of the formula 9. The compound of the formula 9 is reacted with acetonitrile and sulfuric acid by Ritter reaction to obtain 5,6-dihydro-4H-4-acety!amino-6-methylthieno[2,3-b]thiopyran-2 -sulfonamide -7,7-dioxide of the formula HI-Reduction of the compound of the formula .10 using borane-dimethy (sulfide yields 5,6-dihydro-4H-4-ethylamino-6-methylthieno[2,3-b]thiopyran-2-sulfonaniide-7,7-dioxide of the formula JT. The racemic cis/trans isomer of the formula 1_1, is treated with ethanolic-hydrochloride and followed by sodium bicarbonate to get the (Â±)tfans 5,6-dihydro-4H~4-ethy}antino--6-methyithieno[2,3-b]thiopyran-2-sulfonamide-7,7-dioxide of the formula 12. This trans isomer of the formula 12 on resolution using di-p-toluoyl-D-tartaric acid and di-p-toluoyl-L-tartaric acid and followed by treating with hydrochloric acid to obtain Dorzolamide hydrochloride of the formula! as described in the Scheme-3.<br><br><br>

(f) The over all yield reported was only 1.78 % from 2-bromothiophene of the formula \9_.<br>
Yet another patent WO 2006/038222 also has disclosed a process for the preparation of (4S,6S)-4-(ethylamino)-5,6-dihydro-6-methyl-4H-thieno[2,3-b]thiopyran-2-suifonamide7,7-dioxide hydrochloride (Dorzolamide hydrochloride) of the formula 1_ by doing resolution of (Â±)trans 5,6-Dihydro-4H-4-ethylamino-6-methylthieno[2,3-b]thiopyran-2-sulfonamide-7,7-dioxide of the formula t2 using dibenzoyl-L-tartaric acid or di-p-toluoyl-L-tartaric acid in methanol solvent.
