				<td>Technical field [0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a gripping tool that is attached to the end of a drainage tube and gripped by a removal member when one end of the drainage tube (drainage tube) remaining in the abdominal cavity is pulled out of the body by the removal member, e.g., forceps.<br>
Prior art [0002]<br>
In a surgical operation, a drainage tube for draining fluids in the thoracic cavity or abdominal cavity is often used. In the method for retaining the drainage tube using the example of a thoracic cavity drainage tube, first, one end of the drainage tube is inserted into the body from an incised portion in the thoracic cavity during the surgery, for example. A loculus that connects to the thoracic cavity is also formed from the portion of the body surface positioned near the aforementioned incised portion. Then a removal member, e.g., forceps, is slipped into the thoracic cavity through the aforementioned loculus, and one end of the drainage tube is gripped.<br>
[0003]<br>
Then the removal member is pulled out leaving the other end of the drainage tube in the thoracic cavity. By so doing, one end of the drainage tube leads out of the body, and the other end of the drainage tube is left in the thoracic cavity. In this state, a suction bag or the like is connected to the one end of the drainage tube, and by applying negative pressure to the one end of the drainage tube relative to the other end, pus, blood, or other exudates are discharged through the discharge tube outside the body (suction bag).<br>
[0004]<br>
In the aforementioned discharge tube retention method, a forceps is generally used as the removal member, and when the end of the discharge tube is pulled out of the body by the forceps, the forceps sometimes cannot satisfactorily grip the discharge tube. For this reason, shaping the end portion of the discharge tube by cutting it on a slant to make it easy to grip with the forceps or attaching a gripping tool to the end of the discharge tube to facilitate gripping of the discharge tube have been proposed. In addition, in Japanese Kokai Utility Model No. 2[1990]-77054<br>
, a method is proposed wherein an advance part is attached to one end of the discharge tube, a guide wire is passed inside the advance part, and the end of the discharge tube is guided outside the body by guiding the discharge tube along the guide wire.<br>
Summary of the invention [0005]<br>
The loculus formed in the body for slipping the removal member into the body when the end of the discharge tube is pulled out with a removal member such as forceps should preferably be a small as possible in order to reduce the burden on the patient. Therefore, when the removal member gripping an end of the discharge tube is pulled out of the body, it must be pulled so that the discharge tube follows in a direction parallel to the direction that the removal member is pulled out in order for the sectional area through which the discharge tube passes when passing through the loculus to be smaller. However, with existing removal technology, the discharge tube is not necessarily limited to being gripped following the direction that the removal member is pulled out and is often gripped at an angle to the direction that the removal member is pulled out. With such a gripping state, because the discharge tube is pointed at an angle relative to the direction the removal member is pulled out, the discharge tube sometimes interferes, and the discharge tube cannot be pulled out of a loculus that has a small surface area.<br>
[0006]<br>
This invention was devised in consideration of such a situation with the objective of providing a gripping tool that can be reliably gripped by a removal member such as forceps and that also makes it possible to pull the discharge tube out through a loculus with a small sectional area after gripping.<br>
[0007]<br>
In order to accomplish the abovementioned objective, the features of the gripping tool pertaining to the present invention are that, in a gripping tool that is attached to one end of a flexible discharge tube for discharging fluids in the body outside the body and that is gripped by a removal member for pulling one end of the aforementioned discharge tube remaining in the body outside the body, there are provided a main body that is affixed to one end of the aforementioned discharge tube, a gripped part that is gripped by the aforementioned removal member, and a connecting part that can bend and that also connects the aforementioned main body and the aforementioned gripped part.<br>
[0008]<br>
The abovementioned gripping tool of the present invention has a gripped part that is gripped by a removal member, such as a forceps, so it is gripped reliably by the removal member due to the gripped part. With the gripping tool of the present invention, the connecting part that connects the main body and the gripped part is also constituted to be able to bend. Therefore, when the gripped part is pulled out by the removal member in a direction different from the direction of the one end of the discharge tube, the connecting part bends to follow the direction of pull-out by the removal member. When pulled out farther in the direction of pull-out in this state, a tensile force following the pull-out direction acts on the connecting part, and this tension is transmitted to the main body from the connecting part. For this reason, the main body is pulled by the connecting part in the pull-out direction.<br>
[0009]<br>
In this case, because the main body receives an external force in the pull-out direction from the connecting part, its direction is changed toward the pull-out direction by the moment of the external force. Because the main body is attached to one end of the discharge tube, the directions of both the discharge tube and the main body are changed toward the pull-out direction by the aforementioned moment. By using the gripping tool of the present invention, the direction of the discharge tube is changed toward the pull-out direction by the removal tool in this way.<br>
[0010]<br>
Therefore, when the removal member, such as forceps, is pulled out of the loculus, the gripping tool and the discharge tube are pulled out of the loculus accompanying the forceps, and because the discharge tube is guided following the pull-out direction, the sectional area through which it passes through the loculus can be approximately equal to the discharge tube radial orientation sectional area. In this way, with the present invention, the sectional passage area for passage of the end of the discharge tube through the loculus can be made sufficiently small, so the discharge tube can be guided reliably through a loculus with a small sectional area.<br>
[0011]<br>
In the present invention, "can bend" means that it is possible for the connecting part to bend to follow the pull-out direction due to the removal member. Therefore, it is assumed that this includes deformation caused by curving or the like, in addition to bending due to deformation such as buckling. Cases of bending structurally are also assumed to be included. Examples of constitutions for a connecting part that can bend include constitutions formed with a material that can bend, such as a cord-like material, rubber material, or resin material. Examples where the connecting part can bend structurally include a constitution that connects the main body and the gripped part with a universal joint or a constitution where one end of the connecting part is connected inside the main body with a ball joint or the like and the other end is connected to the gripped part. For the direction that the connecting part can<br>
bend, it need only be able to bend in the pull-out direction due to the removal member, but if it can bend in any direction, it can follow the pull-out direction whatever the direction.<br>
[0012]<br>
In the present invention, the aforementioned main body may also be constituted by an inner surface part facing the inside of the aforementioned discharge tube and an outer surface part that is exposed on the outside of the aforementioned discharge tube, with a pass-through channel formed to pass through from the aforementioned inner surface part to the aforementioned outer surface part, with the aforementioned connecting part disposed to pass through the aforementioned pass-through channel, and with a stop attached to the aforementioned one end to prevent disengagement of the aforementioned connecting part from the aforementioned main body by engaging in the aforementioned main body from the aforementioned inner surface part.<br>
[0013]<br>
With a constitution as described above, the connecting part can be housed in the pass-through channel of the main body and the discharge tube, so the space in which the connecting part is disposed can be reduced and the gripping tool can be constructed compactly. Also, the connecting part can be constituted to be pulled out from inside the pass-through channel and the discharge tube when the gripped part is gripped and pulled out by a removal member such as forceps. If the connecting part is constituted so that it can be pulled out in this way, the gripped part and the main body can be separated by the distance that the connecting part is pulled out. Thus, it can be constituted so that interference of the removal member, such as forceps, with the main body can be prevented, and so that the conversion of the direction of the main body and the discharge tube to the pull-out direction will not be hindered by the aforementioned interference.<br>
[0014]<br>
Multiple projecting parts may also be disposed at intervals on the aforementioned gripped part. If multiple projections are formed at intervals on<br>
the gripped part that is gripped by a removal member such as forceps, the gripped part can be gripped by the removal tool engaging in any of the projecting parts. For this reason, gripping with the removal tool will be easier. In this case, the aforementioned projecting parts could take a shape such as a spherical shape, a rectangular solid shape, or a circular truncated cone shape. Gripping with the removal member will be easier by using such shapes.<br>
[0015]<br>
A slide surface can also be formed on the aforementioned main body to guide the aforementioned removal member to the aforementioned gripped part by sliding when the aforementioned removal member grips the aforementioned main body. In the event that the removal member should slide over the surface of the main body due to the slide surface when the removal member attempts to grip the main body, it will ultimately arrive at the gripped part and will grip the gripped part. For this reason, gripping using the gripped part can be accomplished more reliably.<br>
[0016]<br>
As an example for realizing the aforementioned constitution, the aforementioned pass-through channel is formed in the main body and a tapered slide surface where the tip is pointed is formed on the surface of the main body. The connecting part is also housed in the discharge tube and the pass-through channel of the main body so that the gripped part will be positioned at the pointed portion of the aforementioned slide surface. In such a constitution, when the removal member grips the slide surface, the removal tool slides along the slide surface and is guided to the pointed portion of the slide surface. Because the gripped part is positioned at the pointed portion, the removal member grips the gripped part. When the removal member gripping the gripped part moves further in the pull-out direction, the connecting part is pulled away from the discharge tube and the pass-through passage, and the main body is pulled while bending. In this way, the directions of the main body and the discharge tube are changed.<br>

Preferred embodiments of the invention<br>
[0018]<br>
Below, a gripping tool pertaining to the present invention will be explained in detail using figures. Figure 1 is a side view with a part of gripping tool (100) pertaining to the present invention as a cross section, and Figure 2 is a view in the direction of arrow A in Figure 1. As can be seen from the figures, gripping tool (100) is constituted by main body (10), gripped part (20) and connecting part (30). Gripped part (20) and connecting part (30) are formed as a unit.<br>
[0019]<br>
Figure 3 is a side view showing only main body (10). Main body (10), as shown in Figure 3, is formed symmetrically centered on axis (L) and is constituted by connection opening part (11) and guide part (12). Connection opening part (11) is the portion to which one end of the discharge tube is connected and has a known connection opening shape such that umbrella shapes are stacked in the direction of axis (L) as shown in the figure. Guide part (12) is formed connected to connection opening part (11) in the direction of axis (L) and has a slide surface (12a), the outer diameter of which decreases going from left to right in the figure, a large-diameter end surface (12b) formed at the left end, in the figure, of slide surface (12a), and a small-diameter end surface (12c) formed at the right end, in the figure, of slide surface (12a). Note that with this application example, the curved cross-sectional shape of slide surface (12a) with respect to the direction of axis (L) is at an oblique angle where the curvature increases (curvature radius decreases) going from the left to the right as can be seen from the figure, and it is formed into a truncated cone shape or a truncated bullet shape.<br>
[0020]<br>
Connection opening part (11) is connected to large-diameter end surface (12b) of guide part (12), and the diameter of large-diameter end surface (12b) is larger than the diameter of connection opening part (11) at the connected portion. One end of the discharge tube touches the large-diameter end surface (12b). A pass-through channel (13) is also formed in main body (10) from one end surface (11a), which is the left end surface of connection opening part (11) in the figure, to small-diameter end surface (12c) of guide part (12) in the direction of axis (L).<br>
[0021]<br>
In this embodiment, guide part (12) is formed with polycarbonate (PC) resin, but it could also be formed with another hard plastic resin or a metal material. Slide surface (12a) is formed to give a smooth surface over which,<br>
when gripped by forceps, the forceps will slide and lose its grip on guide part (12).<br>
[0022]<br>
Figure 4 is a cross section showing gripped part (20) and connecting part (30). Gripped part (20) is the portion gripped by forceps or the like and is where a plurality (in the figure, 4) of round truncated cone-shaped projecting parts (21), the diameter of which decreases going from left to right in the figure, are formed. A connecting part (22) that has a smaller diameter than the maximum diameter of projecting part (21) is also placed between adjacent projecting parts (21), and connecting parts (22) serve as spacers so that projecting parts (21) are disposed at a prescribed interval (interval the length of connecting part (22)). Note that for projecting parts (21) and connecting parts (22), the sets of adjacent projecting parts (21) and connecting parts (22) could also be formed as a unit, or they could be formed separately.<br>
[0023]<br>
Connecting part (30) is formed connected to the back end (left end in the figure) of gripped part (20) and is constituted by a rod-shaped part (31) and a stop (32). Rod-shaped part (31) is formed in a long shape and its leading end (right end in the figure) is connected to gripped part (20). Rod-shaped part (31) also has an outer diameter that is a smaller diameter than the inner diameter of pass-through channel (13) formed in main body (10). The axial length of rod-shaped part (31) is also longer than the length in the direction of axis (L) of pass-through channel (13). Stop (32) is formed at the back end (left end in the figure) of rod-shaped part (31), and with this embodiment, is formed in a rectangular solid shape with the corners rounded. Stop (32) outer diameter perpendicular to rod-shaped part (31) is larger than the inner diameter of pass-through channel (13).<br>
[0024]<br>
Gripped part (20) and connecting part (30) in this embodiment are also formed as a unit with a soft resin, such as polyvinyl chloride resin, but they are not limited to this. For example, they can also be formed with polyethylene resin<br>
or another thermoplastic elastomer material. In particular, connecting part (30) could be any material, as long as it can be folded, curved or bent with slight force. For example, it could even be a cord in which fibers are joined. However, taking into account moldability when formed as a unit with gripped part (20), it should be formed with a soft resin material.<br>
[0025]<br>
As shown in Figure 1, a part of connecting part (30) and gripped part (20) are inserted into pass-through channel (13) of main body (10). Gripped part (20) protrudes from small-diameter end surface (12c) of main body (10) and rod-shaped part (31) and stop (32) of connecting part (30) protrude from the one end surface (11 a) of main body (10). The discharge tube is connected to gripping tool (100) through connection opening part (11). Figure 5 shows discharge tube (A) attached to gripping tool (100). As shown in Figure 5, one end of discharge tube (A) is spread by the portion of connection opening part (11) formed into an umbrella shape and is elastically affixed to the umbrella-shaped portion, and its end surface touches large-diameter end surface (12b) of guide part (12). In this state, connection opening part (11) is inserted into the discharge tube, and the one end surface (11a) of connection opening part (11) serves as an inner surface part facing the space inside the discharge tube. At the same time, slide surface (12a) and small-diameter end surface (12c) of guide part (12) serve as the outer surface part exposed outside the discharge tube.<br>
[0026]<br>
Therefore, as can be seen from Figure 5, at connecting part (30), the portion of rod-shaped part (31) protruding from the end surface (11a) of connection opening part (11) and stop (32) are disposed inside discharge tube (A). On the other hand, gripped part (20) protruding from small-diameter end surface (12c) of guide part (12) is disposed in discharge tube (A) and gives a state where it appears from aforementioned small-diameter end surface (12c).<br>
[0027]<br>
Figure 6 is an enlarged view near small-diameter end surface (12c) of guide part (12). As shown in the figure, pass-through channel (13) formed in main body (10) has a constricted part (13a) formed so that the diameter becomes slightly smaller from left to right in the figure near the open part toward small-diameter end surface (12c), The opening diameter of constricted part (13a) at small-diameter end surface (12c) is larger than the diameter of rod-shaped part (31) and connecting part (22) of gripped part (20) and is slightly smaller than the maximum outer diameter of projecting parts (21) of gripped part (20), Also, as shown in the figure, projecting part (21 a), which is the projecting part (21) most toward the back (left end in the figure), is disposed in pass-through channel (13), and the other three project outside.<br>
[0028]<br>
The opening diameter of pass-through channel (13) at small-diameter end surface (12c) is smaller than the maximum outer diameter of projecting parts (21), so projecting parts (21) protruding outside cannot enter pass-through channel (13). Because of this, projecting parts (21) protruding outside become stops, and rod-shaped part (31) cannot move toward the left in the figures. On the other hand, when projecting part (21 a) in pass-through channel (13) tries to move toward the right in the figure to protrude from pass-through channel (13), it must slip through the open part in small-diameter end surface (12c) that has been deformed and is constricted. For this reason, it cannot easily protrude from pass-through channel (13) due to the force of the resistance accompanying deformation, and movement by rod-shaped part (31) toward the right in the figure is restricted by a prescribed force of resistance along with that movement.<br>
[0029]<br>
By furnishing constricted part (13a) at the open end (small-diameter end surface (12c)) of pass-through channel (13) and because projecting part (21) is caught by small-diameter end surface (12c), gripped part (20) and connecting part (30) can be affixed to main body (10). The component constituting gripped part (20) and connecting part (30) can be kept immobile relative to main body<br>
(10) when gripping tool (100) is transported, etc. Note that the state shown in Figure 6 can be realized by pushing gripped part (20) from the open end toward end surface (11a) of pass-through channel (13), pushing gripped part (20) out of small-diameter end surface (12c) and stopping pushing in the state shown in Figure 6.<br>
In gripping tool (100) of this embodiment that is constituted as described above, first, discharge tube (A) is attached as shown in Figure 5, and main body (10) is affixed to one end of discharge tube (A). Next, from the incision location incised during a surgical operation or the like, discharge tube (A) is inserted into the body with the side at which main body (10) is affixed (leading end) first. Then, discharge tube (A) is manipulated from the incision location by a technique so that the leading end of discharge tube (A) in the body approaches the open part in the aforementioned loculus. Then a forceps is inserted through the loculus and gripping tool (100) is gripped by the forceps.<br>
Figure 7 shows the operation after gripping tool (100) is gripped by forceps (40) and forceps (40) is lifted to remove discharge tube (A) from the loculus. With this embodiment, gripping tool (100) is gripped in the manner shown in Figure 7(a) by forceps (40) inserted through the loculus. Note that the operation to insert forceps (40) through the loculus to grip gripping tool (100) is a blind operation and the position in which gripping tool (100) is gripped by forceps (40) is often not known. Therefore, forceps (40) gripping gripping tool (100) in an oblique horizontal direction as shown in Figure 7(a) sometimes occurs.<br>
The gripping state shown in Figure 7(a) is a state in which forceps (40), with respect to gripping tool (100), grips slide surface (12a) formed on guide part (12) of main body (10) in an oblique horizontal direction. Here, guide part (12) is formed with a hard plastic (polycarbonate resin), and slide part (12a) is formed smooth, so forceps (40) slides over slide surface (12a) by the gripping<br>
force it generates. Slide surface (12a) is also formed so that the outer diameter decreases toward small-diameter end surface (12c) from large-diameter end surface (12b), so forceps (40) slides as in arrow B in the figure from large-diameter end surface (12b) toward small-diameter end surface (12c). Then it slides down over main body (10) from small-diameter end part (12c),<br>
[0033]<br>
Pass-through channel (13) is formed in small-diameter end surface (12c) and gripped part (20) protrudes from this opening. Therefore, forceps (40) that has slid down from small-diameter end surface (12c) will grip gripped part (20) by the tip that has slid down. This state is shown in Figure 7(b). Even if forceps (40) grips main body (10), as an example, in this way, forceps (40) is guided to gripped part (20) by slide surface (12a), and ultimately forceps (40) grips gripped part (20). That is, guide part (12) has the function of guiding forceps (40) to gripped part (20). For this reason, gripped part (20) can be gripped reliably by forceps (40).<br>
[0034]<br>
After the operator confirms that forceps (40) is gripping gripped part (20), forceps (40) is pulled out of the body. In this case, forceps (40) is pulled out of the loculus formed in the body, so it is pulled out along the portion in which the loculus is formed in the pull-out direction. For example, assume that this direction is the direction of arrow C in Figure 7(b). As shown in the figure, the direction of arrow C is different from the direction of discharge tube (A). When forceps (40) is pulled out in the direction of arrow C in the figure, gripped part (20) that is gripped in forceps (40) moves along with forceps (40). Connecting part (30) connected to gripped part (20) is also pulled out a prescribed distance from inside pass-through channel (13) and discharge tube (A). Connecting part (30) is formed of a soft resin and can bend, so the portion that is pulled out bends as in Figure 7(c).<br>
[0035]<br>
When forceps (40) is pulled out farther, connecting part (30) is pulled out of discharge tube (A) and pass-through channel (13) along with it. Soon stop<br>
(32) positioned at the end of connecting part (30) touches the one end surface (11a) formed in connection opening part (11) of main body (10) as shown in Figure 7(d) and engages. Main body (10) and connecting part (30) are connected by this engaging, and gripped part (20) is connected to main body (10) by connecting part (30). Disengagement of connecting part (30) from main body (10) is also prevented by this touching, and further pulling out of rod-shaped part (31) of connecting part (30) is prevented. For this reason, the part of rod-shaped part (31) already pulled out is subjected to a tensile force from forceps (40) and is stretched tight, it bends at the portion protruding from main body (10) as shown in the figure, and the portion at the end is extended to follow the direction that forceps (40) is pulling. In such a state, a state in which a tensile force acts on rod-shaped part (31) of connecting part (30) in the pull-out direction is produced, and the tensile force is transmitted to main body (10) from connecting part (30). For this reason, main body (10) is pulled toward connecting part (30) in the pull-out direction.<br>
[0036]<br>
In this case, because main body (10) is subjected to an external force in the pull-out direction from connecting part (30), its direction is changed to point toward the pull-out direction by the moment of the external force. Here, since main body (10) is attached to one end of discharge tube (A), discharge tube (A) is also subjected to a rotation force in the direction of arrow D toward the pull-out direction along with main body (10) due to the aforementioned moment, and the direction of discharge tube (A) is changed to the pull-out direction by forceps (40) by using gripping tool (100) of the present invention. This state is shown in Figure 7(e).<br>
[0037]<br>
Therefore, when forceps (40) is pulled out through the loculus, gripping tool (100) and discharge tube (A) are pulled out through the loculus along with it, and since discharge tube (A) is guided in the pull-out direction, no interference, such as catching on the edges of the loculus, occurs, and it can be pulled out rapidly. For this reason, discharge tube (A) can be guided out of a loculus with a small formation area.<br>
With this embodiment as above, gripping tool (100) is constituted by a main body (10) that is affixed to one end of discharge tube (A), a gripped part (20) that is gripped by forceps (40), and a connecting part (30) that can bend and that also connects main body (10) and gripped part (20). Therefore, the direction of discharge tube (A) can be changed to the pull-out direction by forceps (40) under the action described above, and when discharge tube (A) is guided from the body along with forceps (40), the sectional area for its passage through the loculus can be made sufficiently small. Thus, discharge tube (A) can be guided out reliably.<br>
Also, in main body (10), a pass-through channel (13) is formed that passes from one end surface (11 a) that faces the inside of discharge tube (A) to small-diameter end surface (12c) exposed outside discharge tube (A). Connecting part (30) is disposed through the inside of pass-through channel (13) and is constituted so that one end is positioned inside discharge tube (A), and gripped part (20) is connected to the other end. At the aforementioned one end of connecting part (30), main body (10) and gripped part (20) are connected by engaging in main body (10) at one end surface (11a), and a stop (32) is attached to prevent disengagement of connecting part (30) from main body (10). Therefore, connecting part (30) can be housed inside pass-through channel (13) of main body (10) and discharge tube (A), the space in which connecting part (30) is disposed can be reduced and gripping tool (100) can be constructed compactly.<br>
When gripped part (20) is gripped and pulled out by forceps (40), connecting part (30) is pulled from the inside of pass-through channel (13) and discharge tube (A) and is guided out of the discharge tube, so gripped part (20) and main body (10) can be separated by the distance that connecting part (30) is pulled out. For this reason, forceps (40) does not interfere with main body (10) in the process of being pulled out by forceps (40). Thus, obstruction of a<br>
change in direction of main body (10) and discharge tube (A) by the aforementioned interference can be prevented.<br>
Multiple projecting parts (21) are also disposed at intervals on gripped part (20) with connecting parts (22) as spacers. For this reason, when forceps (40) grips gripped part (20), forceps (40) engages on any of projecting parts (21), and gripped part (20) can be gripped reliably. A slide surface (12a) is also formed on guide part (12) of main body (10), and when forceps (40) grips slide surface (12a), forceps (40) slides along slide surface (12a) and is guided to gripped part (20). Even if forceps (40) grips main body (10) via slide surface (12a), the constitution is such that it will ultimately arrive at gripped part (20) so that gripped part (20) can be gripped reliably.<br>
An embodiment of the present invention was explained above, but the present invention is not limited to the aforementioned embodiment. For example, with the aforementioned embodiment, the shape of main body (10) was explained based on a shape as shown in Figure 3, but various changes are possible, such as providing connecting opening part (11) with a cylindrical shape and changing the slant angle of slide surface (12a) as shown in Figure 8. In addition, the shape of gripped part (20), and particularly projecting parts (21), can have a spherical or rectangular solid shape as shown in Figure 9. The shape of stop (32) can also be conical or spherical as shown in Figure 9. Any of these changes is possible as long as the shape exhibits the function and effects accompanying the present invention.<br><br><br><br><br>
