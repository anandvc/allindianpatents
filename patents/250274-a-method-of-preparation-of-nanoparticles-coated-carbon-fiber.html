EXPECTED OUTCOME 5: The composites made of nanoparticles coated carbon fibers/fabrics can also be used to replace the conventional sport materials like tennis racket, golf shaft, etc.<br>
Example A<br>
A simple horizontal tubular reactor is used to coat metal/ metal oxide nanoparticles on carbon fiber/ fabric. This reactor has a quartz tube of 840 mm length with an outer diameter of 49 mm and inner diameter of 45 mm. It is constructed in such a way that the carbon fiber/fabric can be easily inserted and removed from the reactor. The reactor is heated in a three zone tubular furnace. A proportional temperature controller controls the furnace temperature in each zone. The temperature is kept around 500 to 900°C in the mid zone of furnace to facilitate the decomposition of precursor gases. The inlet and outlet temperatures were maintained in the range of 300 to 600°C. Nitrogen, helium, argon, chlorine, hydrogen, and mixtures of it are used as precursor gases. Each gas has its own function. Hydrogen/chlorine acts as a reducing gas and nitrogen/helium/argon acts as a carrier gas and also provides the inert atmosphere inside the reactor. The coating of catalyst i.e., iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni), ruthenium (Ru), rhodium (Rh), palladium (Pd), iridium (Ir), platinum (Pt) chromium (Cr), molybdenum (Mo), etc on glass fiber(s)/fabric is done by the conventional dip coating/sol-gel/wet spraying technique (For composition: Tables: A to F). The carbon fiber/fabric is dipped in a bath containing nickel sulphate (NiSO4 6H2O,<br><br>
source of nickel), sodium hypophosphite (NaH2PO2 H2O, reducing agent), ammonium chloride (NH4Cl, complexing agent), tri-sodium citrate (Na3C6H5O7 2H2O, stabilizer), ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH, pH adjustment) for coating of nickel (Table A). The catalyst coated glass carbon fiber/fabric is kept in the middle zone of the reactor. The reactor is connected to a vacuum line and then pumped down to less than 200 mm Hg. This process is continued 10 times till it is free of oxygen. In the next step the temperature of reactor is increased in between 400 to 600°C in an inert atmosphere. The rate of inert gas flow is kept constant at 120 ml/min. After 5 to 10 minutes reducing gas is allowed to flow at the rate of 5 to 25 ml/min for 10 to 30 minutes. Again after 5 to 10 minutes, temperature is increased to 500-900°C. The gases entered in the reactor through three different non-return valves. The flow rates of gases are measured by mass flow controller. The water circulation arrangement is made at inlet and exit of the reactors tube to keep the temperature at desired level. Water is also used as a coolant in the condenser. Any condensable in the reactor effluent is collected in a liquid collector where as noncondensables are sent to the exit flow, which is recorded by the pressure indicator dial and then vented to the atmosphere. The nanomaterial coated carbon fiber/fabric is characterized by XRD, TGA, SEM, IV, etc.<br>
Example B<br>
In this case the carbon fiber/fabric is dipped in a bath. The formulation of bath is given in Table B. The catalyst coated carbon fiber/fabric is placed inside the reactor for coating of nanomaterials. The experimental condition is same as mentioned in Example A.<br>
Example C<br>
In this case the carbon fiber/fabric is dipped in a bath. The formulation of bath is given in Table C. The catalyst coated carbon fiber/fabric is placed inside the reactor for coating of nanomaterials. The experimental condition is same as mentioned in Example A.<br>
