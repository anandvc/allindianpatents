FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br><br><br>
The invention relates to a novel pyrrole substituted 2-indolinone compounds having the chemical structure as described herein:<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The invention further relates generally to organic chemistry, biochemistry, pharmacology and medicine. More particularly, it relates to novel pyrrole substituted 2-indolinole compounds, and their physiologically acceptable salts and prodrugs, which modulate the activity of protein kinases ("PKs") and thus are expected to exhibit a salutary effect against disorders related to abnormal PK activity.<br><br><br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br><br><br>
The following is offered as background information only and is not admitted to be prior art to the present invention.<br><br><br>
PKs are enzymes that catalyze the phosphorylation of hydroxyl groups on tyrosine, serine and threonine residues of proteins. The consequences of this seemingly simple activity are staggering; cell growth, differentiation and proliferation, i.e., virtually all aspects of cell life in one way or another depend on PK activity. Furthermore, abnormal PK activity has been related to a host of disorders, ranging from reiatively non-life threatening diseases such as psoriasis to extremely virulent diseases such as glioblastoma (brain cancer).<br><br>
The PKs can be conveniently be broken down into two classes, the protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) and the serinethreon~ine kinases (STKs).<br><br>
One of the prime aspects of PTK activity is their involvement with growth factor receptors. Growth factor receptors are cell-surface proteins. When bound by a growth factor ligand, growth factor receptors are converted to an active form which interacts with proteins on the inner surface of a cell membrane. This leads to phosphorylation on tyrosine residues of the receptor and other proteins and to the formation inside the cell of complexes with a variety of cytoplasmic signaling molecules that, in turn, effect numerous cellular responses such as cell division (proliferation), cell differentiation1 cell growth, expression of metabolic effects to the extracellular microenvironment, etc. For a more complete discussion, see Schiessinger and Ulirich, ~ 9:303-391 (1992) which is incorporated by reference, including any drawings, as if fully set forth herein.<br><br>
Growth factor receptors with PTK activity are known as receptor tyrosine kinases ("RTKs") . They comprise a large family of transmembrane receptors with diverse biological activity. At present, at least nineteen (19) distinct subfamilies of RTKs have been identified. An example of these is the subfamily designated the "HER" RTKs, which include EGFR (epithelial growth factor receptor), HER2, HER3 and HER4. These RTKS consist of an extracellular glycosylated ligand binding domain, a transmernbrane domain and an intracellular cytoplasmic catalytic domain that can phosphorylate tyrosine residues on proteins.<br><br>
Another RTK subfamily consists of insulin receptor (IR), insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-lR) and insulin receptor related receptor (IRR). IR and IGF-IR interact with insulin, IGF-I and IGF-II to form a heterotetramer of two<br>
entirely extracellular glycosylated a subunits and two ~3 subunits which cross the cell membrane and which contain the tyros.ine kinase domain.<br><br>
A third RTX subfamily is referred to as the platelet derived growth factor receptor ("PDGFR~) group, which includes PDGFRa, PDGFRj3, CSFIR, c-kit and c-fins. These receptors consist of glycosylated extracellular domains composed of variable numbers of immunoglobin-like loops and an intracellular domain wherein the tyrosine kinase domain is interrupted by unrelated amino acid sequences.<br><br>
Another group which, because of its similarity to the PDGPR subfamily, is sometimes subsumed into the later group is the fetus liver kinase ("f 1k") receptor subfamily. This group is believed to be made of up of kinase insert domain-receptor fetal liver kinase-l (KDR/FLK-l), fik-iR, flk-4 and fins-like tyrosine kinase 1 (flt-l).<br><br>
A further member of the tyrosine kinase growth factor receptor family is the fibroblast growth factor ("FGF") receptor subgroup. This group consists of four receptors, FGFRl-4, and seven ligands, FGF1-7. While not yet well defined, it appears that the receptors consist of a glycosylated extracellular domain containing a variable number of immunoglobin-like loops and an intracellular domain in which the tyrosine kinase sequence is interrupted by regions of unrelated amino acid sequences.<br><br>
Still another member of the tyrosine kinase growth factor receptor family is the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF't) receptor subgroup. VEGF is a dimeric glycoprotein similar to PDGF but has different biological functions and target cell specificity ~ vivo. In particular, VEGF is presently thought to play an essential role is vasculogenesis and angiogenesis.<br>
A more complete listing of the known RTK subfamilies is described in Plowman et al., ~ 7(6):334-339 (1994) which is incorporated by reference, including any drawings, as if fully set forth herein.<br><br>
In addition to the RTKs, there also exists a family of entirely intracellular PTKs called "non-receptor tyrosine kinases" or "cellular tyrosine kinases." This latter designation, abbreviated "CTK," will be used herein. CTKs do not contain extracellular and transinembrane domains. At present, ove: 24 CTKs in 11 subfamilies (Src, Frk, Btk, Csk, Abl, Zap7o, Fes, Fps, Fak, Jak and Ack) have been identified. The Src subfamily appear so far to be the largest group of CTKs and includes Src, Yes, Fyn, Lyn, Lck, Blk, Hck, Fgr and Yrk. For a more detailed discussion of CTKs, see Bolen, ~ 8:2025-2031 (1993), which is incorporated by reference, including any drawings, as if fully set forth herein.<br><br>
The serine/threonine kinases, STKs, like the CTKs, are predominantly intracellular although there are a few receptor kinases of the STK type. STKS are the most common of the cytosolic kinases; i.e., kinases that perform their function in that part of the cytoplasm other than the cytoplasmic organelles and cytoskelton. The cytosol is the region within the cell where much of the cell's intermediary metabolic and biosynthetic activity occurs; e.g., it is in the cytosol that proteins are synthesized on ribosomes.<br><br>
RTKS, CTKs and STKs have all been implicated in a host of pathogenic conditions including, significantly, cancer. Other pathogenic conditions which have been associated with PTKs include, without limitation, psoriasis, hepatic cirrhosis, diabetes, angiogenesis, restenosis, ocular diseases, rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory disorders, immunological disorders such as autoiminune disease,<br>
cardiovascular disease such as atherosclerosis and a variety of renal disorders.<br><br>
With regard to cancer, two of the major hypotheses advanced to explain the excessive cellular pr6liferation that drives tumor development relate to functions known to be PK regulated. That is, it has been suggested that malignant cell growth results from a breakdown in the mechanisms that control cell division and/or differentiation. It has been shown that the protein products of a number of proto-oncogenes are involved in the signal transduction pathways that regulate cell growth and differentiation. These protein products of proto-oncogenes include the extracellular growth factors, transinembrane growth factor PTK receptors (RTKs), cytoplasmic PTKs (CTKs) and cytosolic STKs, discussed above.<br><br>
In view of the apparent link between PK-related cellular activities and wide variety of human disorders, it is no surprise that a great deal of effort is being expended in an attempt to identify ways to modulate PK activity. Some of these have involved biomimetic approaches using large molecules patterned on those involved in the actual cellular processes (e.g., mutant ligands (U.S. App. No. 4,966,849); soluble receptors and antibodies (App. No. WO 94/10202, Kendall and Thomas, Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci.., 90:10705-09 (1994), Kim, et al., ~ 362:841-844 (1993)); RNA ligands (Jelinek, et al., ~ 33:10450-56); Takano, et al., Mol. Bio. Cell 4:358A (1993); Kinsella, et al., ExD. Cell Res. 199:56-62 (1992); Wright, et al., J. Cellular Phvs., 152:448-<br><br>
57) and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (WO 94/03427; WO 92/21660; WO 91/15495; WO 94/14808; U.S. Pat. No. 5,330,992; Mariani, et al., Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res., 35:2268 (1994)).<br><br>
In addition to the above, attempts have been made to identify small molecules which act as PK inhibitors. For example, bis- monocy)4.c, bicyclic and heterocyclic aryl<br>
compounds (PCT WO 92/20642), vinylene-azaindole derivatives (PCT WO 94/14808) and l-cyclopropyl-4-pyridylquinolones (U.S. Pat. No. 5,330,992) have been described as tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Styryl compounds (U.S. Pat. No. 5,217,999), styrylsubstituted pyridyl compounds (US Pat. No. 5,302,606), quinazoline derivatives (EP App. No. 0 566 266 Al), selenaindoles and selenides (PCT WO 92/21660) and benzylphosphonic acid compounds (PCT WO 9 1/15495) have all been described as PTK inhibitors useful in the treatment of cancer.<br><br>

Our own efforts to identify small organic molecules which modulate PK activity and which, therefore, are expected to be useful in the treatment and prevention of disorders involving abnormal PK activity, has led us to the discovery of a family of novel pyrrole substituted 2-indoline compounds which exhibit PK modulating ability and are thereby expected to have a salutary effect against disorders related to abnormal PK activity; it is these compounds which is the subject of this invention.<br><br>
Thus, the present invention relates generally to novel pyrrole substituted 2-indolinones which modulate the activity of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), non-receptor protein (STKs). In addition, the present invention relates to the preparation and use of pharmaceutical compositions of the disclosed compounds and their physiologically acceptable salts and prodrugs in the treatment or prevention of PK driven disorders such as, by way of example and not limitation, cancer, diabetes, hepatic cirrhosis, cardiovascular disease such as arthrosclerosis, angiogenesis, immunological disease such as autoimmune disease and renal disease.<br>

A "pyrrole~ refers to a molecule having the chemical structure:<br><br>
"Pyrrole substituted 2-indolinone" and "~ -pyrrolidenyl-2-<br><br>

1 • CHEMISTRY<br><br>
A.	General Structural Features.<br><br>
Jn one aspect, the the present invention relate to pyrrole substituted 2-indolinones which, in addition to being otherwise optionally substituted on both the pyrrole and 2-indolinone portions of the compound, are necessarily substituted on the pyrrole moiety with one or more hydrocarbon chains which themselves are substituted with at least one polar group. Physiologically acceptable salts and prodrugs of the claimed compounds are also within the scope of this invention.<br><br>
A "hydrocarbon chain" refers to an alkyl, alkenyl or alkynyl group, as defined herein.<br><br>
A "polar" group refers to a group wherein the nuclei of the atoms covalently bound to each other to form the group do not share the electrons of the covalent bond(s) joining them equally; that is the electron cloud is denser about one atom than another. This results in one end of the covalent bond(s) being relatively negative and the other end relatively positive; i.e., there is a negative pole and a positive pole. Examples of polar groups include, without limitation, hydroxy, alkoxy, carboxy, nitro, cyano, amino, ammonium, amido, ureido, sulfonamido, sulfinyl, sulfonyl, phosphono, morpholino, piperazinyl and tetrazolo.<br><br>
While not being bound to any particular theory, applicants at this time believe that the polar groups may interact electronically, for example, but without limitation, through hydrogen bonds, Van der Walls forces and/or ionic bonds (but not covalent bonding), with the amino acids at a PTK active site. These interactions may assist the molecules of this invention to bind to an active site with sufficient tenacity to interfere with or prevent the natural substrate from entering the site. Polar groups may also contribute to<br>
the selectivity of the compounds; i.e., One polar group may have greater affinity for a PTK binding domain than other polar groups so that the compound containing the first particular polar group is more potent than the compounds containing the other polar groups.<br><br>

It will be clear to those skilled in the art, based both on known general principles of organic synthesis and on the disclosures herein which base would be most appropriate for the reaction contemplated.<br>
The solvent in which the reaction is carried out may be a protic or an aprotic solvent, preferably it is a protic solvent. A "protic solvent" is a solvent which has hydrogen atom(s) covalently bonded to oxygen or nitrogen atoms which renders the hydrogen atoms appreciably acidic and thus capable of being "shared" with a solute through hydrogen bonding. Examples of protic solvents include, without limitation, water and alcohols.<br><br>
An "aprotic solvent" may be polar or non-polar but, in either case, does not contain acidic hydrogens and therefore is not capable of hydrogen bonding with solutes. Examples, without limitation, of non-polar aprotic solvents, are pentane, hexane, benzene, toluene, methylene chloride and carbon tetrachloride.<br>
Examples of polar aprotic solvents are chloroform, tetrahydrofuran, dimethylsulfoxide and dimethylformamide.<br><br>
In a presently preferred embodiment of this invention, the solvent is a protic solvent, preferably water br an alcohol such as ethanol.<br><br>
The reaction is carried out at temperatures greater than room temperature. The temperature is generally from about 300 C to about 1500 C, preferably about 800C to about 1000 C, most preferable about 750 C to about 850 C, which is about the boiling point of ethanol. By "about" is meant that the temperature range is preferably within 10 degrees Celcius of the indicated temperature, more preferably within 5 degrees Celcius of the indicated temperature and, most preferably, within 2 degrees Celcius of the indicated temperature. Thus, for example, by "about 750 C" is meant 750 C ± 100 C, preferably 750 C ± 50 C and most preferably, 750 C ± 2 C.<br><br>

In particular, modulating refers to the activation of the catalytic activity of RTKs, CTKs and STKs, preferably the activ~tion or inhibition of the catalytic activity of RTKs, CTKs and STKs, depending on the concentration of the compound or salt to which the RTK, CTK or STK is exposed or, more preferably, the inhibition of the catalytic activity of RTKs, CTKs and STKs.<br><br>
The term "catalytic activity" as used herein refers to the rate of phosphorylation of tyrosine under the influence, direct or indirect, of RTKs and/or CTKs or the phosphorylation of serine and threonine under the influence, direct or indirect, of STKs.<br><br>
The term "contacting" as used herein refers to bringing a compound of this invention and a target PK together in such a manner that the compound can affect the catalytic activity of the PlC, either directly, i.e., by interacting with the kinase itself, or indirectly, i.e., by interacting with another molecule on which the catalytic activity of the kinase is dependent. Such "contacting" can be accomplished ~ vitro," i.e., in a test tube, a petri dish or the like. In a test tube, contacting may involve only a compound and a PlC of interest or it may involve whole cells. Cells may also be maintained or grown in cell culture dishes and contacted with a compound in that environment. In this context, the ability of a particular compound to affect a PK related disorder, i.e., the IC50 of the compound, defined below, can be determined before use of the compounds jn vivo with more complex living organisms is attempted. For cells outside the organism, multiple methods exist, and are well-known to those skilled in the art, to get the PKs in contact with the compounds including, but not limited to, direct cell microinjection and numerous transinembrane carrier techniques.<br><br>
A further aspect of this invention is that the modulation of the catalytic activity of PKs using a compound of this invention may be carried out jfl ~ or .jfl vivo.<br>
"~ vitro" refers to procedures performed in an artificial environment such as, e.g., without limitation, in a test tube or culture medium.<br><br>

therapeutically effective amount of a compound, salt or prodrug that is a 3-pyrrolidenyl-2-indolinone of the present invention to the organism is another aspect of this invention.<br><br>
As used herein, "PlC related disorder," "PlC driven disorder," and "abnormal PlC activity" all refer to a condition characterized by inappropriate, i.e., under or, more commonly, over, PlC catalytic activity, where the particular PlC can be an RTK, a CTK or an STK. Inappropriate catalytic activity can arise as the result of either: (1) PlC expression in cells which normally do not express PI(s, (2) increased PlC expression leading to unwanted cell proliferation, differentiation and/or growth, or, (3) decreased PlC expression leading to unwanted reductions in cell proliferation, differentiation and/or growth. Over-activity of a PlC refers to either amplification of the gene encoding a particular PlC or production of a level of PlC activity which can correlate with a cell proliferation, differentiation and/or growth disorder (that is, as the level of the PK increases, the severity of one or more of the symptoms of the cellular disorder increases). Under-activity is, of course, the converse, wherein the severity of one or more symptoms of a cellular disorder increase as the level of the PlC activity decreases.<br><br>
As used herein, the terms "prevent", "preventing" and "prevention" refer to a method for barring an organism from acquiring a PlC related disorder in the first place.<br><br>
As used herein, the terms "treat", "treating" and<br><br>
"treatment" refer to a method of alleviating or abrogating a PlC mediated cellular disorder and/or its attendant symptoms. With regard particularly to cancer, these terms simply mean that the life expectancy of an individual affected with a cancer will be increased or that one or more of the symptoms of the disease will be reduced.<br>
The term "organism" refers to any living entity comprised of at least one cell. A living organism can be as simple as, for e~xample, a single eukariotic cell or as complex as a mammal, including a human being.<br><br>
The term "therapeutically effective amount" as used herein refers to that amount of the compound being administered which will relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms of the disorder being treated. In reference to the treatment of cancer, a therapeutically effective amount refers to that amount which has the effect of (1) reducing the size of the tumor, (2) inhibiting (that is, slowing to some extent, preferably stopping) tumor metastasis, (3) inhibiting to some extent (that is, slowing to some extent, preferably stopping) tumor growth, and/or, (4) relieving to some extent (or, preferably, eliminating) one or more symptoms associated with the cancer.<br><br>
It is an aspect of this invention that the above-referenced protein kinase related disorder is selected from the group consisting of a receptor protein tyrosine kinase related disorder, a cellular tyrosine kinase disorder and a serine-threonine kinase related disorder.<br><br>
In yet another aspect of this invention, the above referenced protein kinase related disorder is selected from the group consisting of an EGFR related disorder, a PDGFR related disorder, an IGFR related disorder and a f 1k related disorder.<br><br>

It is as aspect of this invention that a chemical compound that modulates the catalytic activity of a protein kinase may be identified by contacting cells expressing said protein kinase with a compound, salt or prodrug that is a 3-pyrrolidenyl-2-indolinone of the present invention and then monitoring said cells for an effect.<br><br>
By "monitoring" is meant observing or detecting the effect of contacting a compound with a cell expressing a particular PlC. The observed or detected effect can be a chan~e in cell phenotype, in the catalytic activity of a PlC or a change in the interaction of a PlC with a natural binding partner. Techniques for observing or detecting such effects are well-known in the art.<br><br>
The above-referenced effect is selected from a change or an absence of change in a cell phenotype, a change or absence of change in the catalytic activity of said protein kinase or a change or absence of change in the interaction of said protein kinase with a natural binding partner in a final aspect of this invention.<br><br>
"Cell phenotype" refers to the outward appearance of a cell or tissue or the biological function of the cell or tissue. Examples, without limitation, of a cell phenotype are cell size, cell growth, cell proliferation, cell<br>
differentiation, cell survival, apoptosis, and nutrient uptake and use. Such phenotypic characteristics are measurable by techni~ques well-known in the art.<br><br>
A "natural binding partner" refers to a polypeptide that binds to a particular PlC in a cell. Natural binding partners can play a role in propagating a signal in a PlC-mediated signal transduction process. A change in the interaction of the natural binding partner with the PlC can manifest itself as an increased or decreased concentration of the PK/natural binding partner complex and, as a result, in an observable change in the ability of the PlC to mediate signal transduction.<br><br>
It is also an aspect of this invention that a compound described herein, or its salt or prodrug, might be combined with other chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of the diseases and disorders discussed above.

Finally, the combination of a compound of this invention might be expected to be particularly effective in combination with mitoxantrone or paclitaxel for the treatment of solid tumor cancers or leukemias such as, without limitation, acute myelogenous (non-lymphocytic) leukemia.<br><br>

2. INDICATIONS/TARGET DISEASES<br><br>
The PlCs whose catalytic activity is modulated by the compounds of this invention include protein tyrosine kinases of which there are two types, receptor tyrosine kinases (RTlCs) and cellular tyrosine kinases (CTKs), and serine-threonine kinases (STKs). RTlC mediated signal transduction, is initiated by extracellular interaction with a specific growth factor (ligand), followed by receptor dimerization, transient stimulation of the intrinsic protein tyrosine kinase activity and phosphorylation. Binding sites are thereby created for intracellular signal transduction molecules and lead to the formation of complexes with a spectrum of cytoplasmic signaling molecules that facilitate the appropriate cellular response (e.g., cell division, metabolic effects on the extracellular microenvironment, etc.) . See, Schlessinger and Ullrich, 1992, Neuron 9:303-391.<br><br>
It has been shown that tyrosine phosphorylation sites on growth factor receptors function as high-affinity binding sites for SH2 (src homology) domains of signaling molecules. Fantl et al., 1992, ~ 69:413-423, Songyang et al., 1994, Mol. Cell. Biol. 14:2777-2785), Songyang et al., 1993, Cell 72:767-778, and Koch et al., 1991, Science 252:668-678. Several intracellular substrate proteins that associate with RTKs have been identified. They may be divided into two principal groups: (1) substrates that have a catalytic domain, and (2) substrates which lack such domain but which serve as adapters and associate with catalytically active molecules. Songyang et al., 1993, ~ 72:767-778. The specificity of<br>
the interactions between receptors and SH2 domains of their substrates is determined by the amino acid residues immediately surrounding the phosphorylated tyrosine residue. Differences in the binding affinities between SH2 domains and the amino acid sequences surrounding the phosphotyrosine residues on particular receptors are consistent with the observed differences in their substrate phosphorylation profiles Songyang et al., 1993, ~ 72:767-778. These observations suggest that the function of each RTK is determined not only by its pattern of expression and ligand availability but also by the array of downstream signal transduction pathways that are activated by a particular receptor. Thus, phosphorylation provides an important regulatory step which determines the selectivity of signaling pathways recruited by specific growth factor receptors, as well as differentiation factor receptors.<br><br>
STKs, being primarily cytosolic, affect the internal biochemistry of the cell, often as a down-line response to a PTK event. STKs have been implicated in the signaling process which initiates DNA synthesis and subsequent mitosis leading to cell proliferation.<br><br>
Thus, PlC signal transduction results in, among other responses, cell proliferation, differentiation, growth and metabolism. Abnormal cell proliferation may result in a wide array of disorders and diseases, including the development of neoplasia such as carcinoma, sarcoma, glioblastoma and hemangioma, disorders such as leukemia, psoriasis, arteriosclerosis, arthritis and diabetic retinopathy and other disorders related to uncontrolled angiogenesis and/or vasculogenesis.<br><br>
A precise understanding of the mechanism by which the compounds of this invention inhibit PlCs is not required in order to practice tl~e present invention. However, while not<br>
hereby being bound to any particular mechanism or theory, it is believed that the compounds interact with the amino acids in the catalytic region of PKs. PKs typically possess a bilobate structure wherein ATP appears to bind in the cleft between the two lobes in a region where the amino acids are conserved among PKs. Inhibitors of PKs are believed to bind by non-covalent interactions such as hydrogen bonding, van der Waals forces and ionic interactions in the same general region where the aforesaid ATP binds to the P1(5. More specifically, it is thought that the 2-indolinone component of the compounds of this invention binds in the general space normally occupied by the adenine ring of ATP. Specificity of a particular molecule for a particular PlC may then arise as the result of additional interactions between the various substituents on the 2-indolinone core and the amino acid domains specific to particular PlCs. Thus, different indolinone substituents may contribute to preferential binding to particular P1(5. The ability to select compounds active at different ATP (or other nucleotide) binding sites makes the compounds of this invention useful for targeting any protein with such a site. The compounds disclosed herein may thus have utility as in vitro assays for such proteins as well as exhibiting j~ vivo therapeutic effects through interaction with such proteins.<br><br>
In another aspect, the protein kinase, the catalytic activity of which is modulated by contact with a compound of this invention, is a protein tyrosine kinase, more particularly, a receptor protein tyrosine kinase. Among the receptor protein tyrosine kinases whose catalytic activity can be modulated with a compound of this invention, or salt thereof, are, without limitation, EGF, HER2, HER3, HER4, IR, IGF-lR, IRR, PDGFRz, PDGFRP, CSFIR, C-Kit, C-fins, Flk-lR, Flk4, KDR/Flk-l, Flt-1, FGFR-1R, FGFR-2R, FGFR-3R and FGFR-4R.<br>
The protein tyrosine kinase whose catalytic activity is modulated by contact with a compound of this invention, or a salt or- a prodrug thereof, can also be a non-receptor or cellular protein tyrosine kinase (CTK). Thus, the catalytic activity of CTlCs such as, without limitation, Src, Frk, Btk, Csk, Abl, ZAP7O, Fes, Fps, Fak, Jak, Ack, Yes, Fyn, Lyn, Lck, Blk, Hck, Fgr and Yrk, may be modulated by contact with a compound or salt of this invention.<br><br>
Still another group of PlCs which may have their catalytic activity modulated by contact with a compound of this invention are the serine-threonine protein kinases such as, without limitation, CDK2 and Raf.<br><br>
In another aspect, this invention relates to a method for treating or preventing a PlC related disorder by administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of this invention, or a salt or a prodrug thereof, to an organism.<br><br>
It is also an aspect of this invention that a pharmaceutical composition containing a compound of this invention or a salt or prodrug thereof is administered to an organism for the purpose of preventing or treating a PlC related disorder.<br><br>
This invention is therefore directed to compounds that modulate PlC signal transduction by affecting the enzymatic activity of RTKs, CTKS and/or STKS, thereby interfering with the signals transduced by such proteins. More particularly, the present invention is directed to compounds which modulate RTK, CTK and/or STK mediated signal transduction pathways as a therapeutic approach to cure many kinds of solid tumors, including but not limited to carcinomas, sarcomas including Kaposi's sarcoma, erythroblastoma, glioblastoma, meningioma, astrocytoma, melanoma and myoblastoma. Treatment or prevention of non-solid tumor cancers such as leukemia are also contemplated by this invention. Indications may include, but<br>
are not limited to brain cancers, bladder cancers, ovarian cancers, gastric cancers, pancreas cancers, colon cancers, blood cancers, lung cancers and bone cancers.<br><br>
Further examples, without limitation, of the types of disorders related to inappropriate PlC activity that the compounds described herein may be useful in preventing., treating and studying, are cell proliferative disorders, fibrotic disorders and metabolic disorders.<br><br>
Cell proliferative disorders, which may be prevented, treated or further studied by the present invention include cancer, blood vessel proliferative disorders and mesangial cell proliferative disorders.<br><br>
Blood vessel proliferative disorders refer to disorders related to abnormal vasculogenesis (blood vessel formation) and angiogenesis (spreading of blood vessels). While vasculogenesis and angiogenesis play important roles in a variety of normal physiological processes such as embryonic development, corpus luteum formation, wound healing and organ regeneration, they also play a pivotal role in cancer development where they result in the formation of new capillaries needed to keep a tumor alive. Other examples of blood vessel proliferation disorders include arthritis, where new capillary blood vessels invade the joint and destroy cartilage, and ocular diseases, like diabetic retinopathy, where new capillaries in the retina invade the vitreous, bleed and cause blindness.<br><br>
Two structurally related RTlCs have been identified to bind VEGF with high affinity: the fins-like tyrosine 1 Cf it-l) receptor (Shibuya et al., 1990, OncoQene,5:519-524; De Vries et al., 1992., Science, 255:989-991) and the KDR/FLK-l receptor, also known as VEGF-R2. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been reported to be an endothelial cell specific mitogen with ~ ~ endothelial cell growth<br>
promoting activity. Ferrara &amp; Henzel, 1989, Biochein. BioDhys. Res. Comm., 161:851-858; Vaisman et al., 1990, J. Biol. Chem., 265:19461-19566. Information set forth in U.S. application Ser. Nos. 08/193,829, 08/038,596 and 07/975,750, strongly suggest that VEGF is not only responsible for endothelial cell proliferation, but also is the prime regulator of normal and pathological angiogenesis. See generally, lClagsburn &amp; Soker, 1993, Current BioloQv, 3(10)699-702; Houck, et al., 1992, ~<br><br>
~	267:26031-26037.<br><br>
Normal vasculogenesis and angiogenesis play important roles in a variety of physiological processes such as embryonic development, wound healing, organ regeneration and female reproductive processes such as follicle development in the corpus luteum during ovulation and placental growth after pregnancy. Folkinan &amp; Shing, 1992, J. Biolomical Chem., 267 (16) :10931-34. Uncontrolled vasculogenesis and/or angiogenesis has been associated with diseases such as diabetes as well as with malignant solid tumors that rely on vascularization for growth. lClagsburn &amp; Soker, 1993, Current Biology, 3(l0):699-702; Folkham, 1991, J. Natl. Cancer Inst., 82:4-6; Weidner, et al., 1991, New End. J. Med., 324:1-5.<br><br>
The surmised role of VEGF in endothelial cell proliferation and migration during angiogenesis and vasculogenesis indicates an important role for the KDR/PLK-l receptor in these processes. Diseases such as diabetes mellitus (Folkman, 198, in XIth Condress of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (Verstraeta, et al., eds.), pp. 583-596, Leuven University Press, Leuven) and arthritis, as well as malignant tumor growth may result from uncontrolled angiogenesis. See e.g., Folkman, 1971., N. Endl. J. Med., 285:1182-1186. The receptors to which VEGF specifically binds are an important and powerful therapeutic target for the regulation and modulation of vasculogenesis and/or angiogenesis and a variety<br>
of severe diseases which involve abnormal cellular growth caused by such processes. Plowman, et al., 1994, DN&amp;P, 7(6) :3~34-339. More particularly, the lCDR/FLK-l receptor's highJ.y specific role in neovascularization make it a choice target for therapeutic approaches to the treatment of cancer and other diseases which involve the uncontrolled formation of blood vessels.<br><br>
Thus, one aspect of the present invention relates to compounds capable of regulating and/or modulating tyrosine kinase signal transduction including KDR/FLlC-1 receptor signal transduction in order to inhibit or promote angiogenesis and/or vasculogenesis, that is, compounds that inhibit, prevent, or interfere with the signal transduced by KDR/FLK-l when activated by ligands such as VEGF. Although it is believed that the compounds of the present invention act on a receptor or other component along the tyrosine kinase signal transduction pathway, they may also act directly on the tumor cells that result from uncontrolled angiogenesis.<br><br>
Although the nomenclature of the human and murine counterparts of the generic "f 1k-I" receptor differ, they are, in many respects, interchangeable. The murine receptor, Flk-1, and its human counterpart, KDR, share a sequence homology of 93.4% within the intracellular domain. Likewise, murine FLK-I binds human VEGF with the same affinity as mouse VEGF, and accordingly, is activated by the ligand derived from either species. Millauer et al., 1993, ~ 72:835-846; Quinn et al., 1993, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 90:7533-7537. FLlC-l also associates with and subsequently tyrosine phosphorylates human RTK substrates (e.g., PLC-y or p85) when co-expressed in 293 cells (human embryonal kidney fibroblasts)<br><br>
Models which rely upon the FLK-l receptor therefore are directly applicable to understanding the KDR receptor. For example, use of the inurine FLK-1 receptor in methods which<br>
identify compounds that regulate the murine signal transduction pathway are directly applicable to the identification of compounds which may be used to regulate the human signal transduction pathway, that is, which regulate activity related to the I~R receptor. Thus, chemical compounds identified as inhibitors of KDR/FLlC-1 in ~ can be confirmed in suitable jfl vivo models. Both in xixQ mouse and rat animal models have been demonstrated to be of excellent value for the examination of the clinical potential of agents acting on the KDR/FLK-1 induced signal transduction pathway.<br><br>
Thus, in one aspect, this invention is directed to compounds that regulate, modulate and/or inhibit vasculogenesis and/or angiogenesis by affecting the enzymatic activity of the KDR/FLK-1 receptor and interfering with the signal transduced by KDR/FLK-1. In another aspect, the present invention is directed to compounds which regulate, modulate and/or inhibit the KDR/FLK-1 mediated signal transduction pathway as a therapeutic approach to the treatment of many kinds of solid tumors including, but not limited to, glioblastoma, melanoma and Kaposi's sarcoma, and ovarian, lung, mammary, prostate, pancreatic, colon and epidermoid carcinoma. In addition, data suggest the administration of compounds which inhibit the KDR/Flk-1 mediated signal transduction pathway may also be used in the treatment of hemangio~na, restenois and diabetic retinopathy.<br><br>
A further aspect of this invention relates to the inhibition of vasculogenesis and angiogenesis by other receptor-mediated pathways, including the pathway comprising the flt-l receptor.<br><br>
Receptor tyrosine kinase mediated signal transduction is initiated by extracellular interaction with a specific growth factor (ligand), followed by receptor dimerization, transient stimulation of the intrinsic protein tyrosine kinase activity<br>
and autophosphorylation. Binding sites are thereby created for intracellular signal transduction molecules which leads to the form&amp;t-ion of complexes with a spectrum of cytoplasmic signalling molecules that facilitate the appropriate cellular response, e.g., cell division and metabolic effects to the extracellular microenvironment. See, Schlessinger and Ullrich, 1992, Neuron, 9:1-20.<br><br>
The close homology of the intracellular regions of KDR/FLK-l with that of the PDGF-13 receptor (50.3% homology) and/or the related flt-l receptor indicates the induction of overlapping signal transduction pathways. For example, for the PDGF-f3 receptor, members of the src family (Twamley et al., 1993., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 90:7696-7700), phosphatidylinositol-3'-kinase (Hu et al., 1992, Mol. Cell. jj~., 12:981-990), phospholipase cy (Kashishian &amp; Cooper, 1993, Mol. Cell. Bid., 4:49-51), ras-GTPase-activating protein, (Kashishian et al., 1992, EMBO J., 11:1373-1382), PTP-ID/syp (lCazlauskas et al., 1993, Proc. Natl. Aced. Sci.<br><br>
J,1~AI 10 90:6939-6943), Grb2 (Arvidsson et al., 1994, ~.L Cell. Biol., 14:6715-6726), and the adapter molecules Shc and Nck (Nishimura et al., 1993, Md. Cell. Biol.., 13:6889-6896), have been shown to bind to regions involving different autophosphorylation sites. See generally, Cleesson-Weish, 1994, Proc. Growth Factor Res., 5:37-54. Thus, it is likely that signal transduction pathways activated by KDR/FLK-l include the ras pathway (Rozakis et al., 1992, Nature., 360:689-692), the PI-3'-kinase., the src-mediated and the plcymediated pathways. Each of these pathways may play a critical role in the angiogenic and/or vasculogenic effect of 1~R./FLK-l in endothelial cells. Consequently, a still further aspect of this invention relates to the use of the organic compounds described herein to modulate angiogenesis and vasculogenesis<br>
as such processes are controlled by these pathways. Conversely, disorders related to the shrinkage,<br><br>
contraiction or closing of blood vessels, such as restenosis, are also implicated and may be treated or prevented by the methods of this invention.<br><br>
Fibrotic disorders refer to the abnormal formation of extracellular matrices. Examples of fibrotic disorders include hepatic cirrhosis and mesangial cell proliferative disorders. Hepatic cirrhosis is characterized by the increase in extracellular matrix constituents resulting in the formation of a hepatic scar. An increased extracellular matrix resulting in a hepatic scar can also be caused by a viral infection such as hepatitis. Lipocytes appear to play a major role in hepatic cirrhosis. Other fibrotic disorders implicated include atherosclerosis.<br><br>
Mesangial cell proliferative disorders refer to disorders brought about by abnormal proliferation of mesangial cells. Mesangial proliferative disorders include various human renal diseases such as glomerulonephritis, diabetic nephropathy and malignant nephrosclerosis as well as such disorders as thrombotic microangiopathy syndromes, transplant rejection, and gloinerulopathies. The RTK PDGFR has been implicated in the maintenance of mesangial cell proliferation. Floege et al., 1993, Kidney International .~j:47S-54S.<br><br>
Many cancers are cell proliferative disorders and, as noted previously, PlCs have been associated with cell proliferative disorders. Thus, it is not surprising that PKs such as, for example, members of the RTK family have been associated with the development of cancer. Some of these receptors, like EGFR (Tuzi et al., 1991, Br. J. Cancer 63:227-233, Torp et al., 1992, ~ 100:713-719) HER2/neu (Slamon et al., 1989, Science 244:707-712) and PDGF-R (Kumabe et al., 1992, ~ 7:627-633) are over-expressed in many tumors<br>
and/or persistently activated by autocrine loops. In fact, in the most common and severe cancers these receptor overexpresaions (Akbasak and Suner-Akbasak et al., 1992, ~ Neurol. Sci., 111:119-133, Dickson et al., 1992, Cancer Treatment Res. 61:249-273, lCorc et al., 1992, J. Clin. Invest. 90:1352-1360) and autocrine loops (Lee and Donoghue, 1992, ~<br><br>
~ 118:1057-1070, lCorc et al., ~ Akbasak and Suner-Akbasak et al., supra) have been demonstrated. For example, EGFR has been associated with squamous cell carcinoma, astrocytoma, glioblastoma, head and neck cancer, lung cancer and bladder cancer. HER2 has been associated with breast, ovarian, gastric, lung, pancreas and bladder cancer. PDGFR has been associated with glioblastoma and melanoma as well as lung, ovarian and prostate cancer. The RTI( c-met has also been associated with malignant tumor formation. For example, c-met has been associated with, among other cancers, colorectal, thyroid, pancreatic, gastric and hepatocellular carcinomas and lymphomas. Additionally c-met has been linked to leukemia. Over-expression of the c-met gene has also been detected in patients with Hodgkins disease and Burkitts disease.<br><br>
IGF-IR, in addition to being implicated in nutritional support and in type-Il diabetes, has also been associated with several types of cancers. For example, IGF-I has been implicated as an autocrine growth stimulator for several tumor types, e.g. human breast cancer carcinoma cells (Arteaga et al., 1989, J. Clin. Invest. 84:1418-1423) and small lung tumor cells (Macauley et al., 1990, Cancer Res., 50:2511-2517) . In addition, IGF-I, while integrally involved in the normal growth and differentiation of the nervous system, also appears to be an autocrine stimulator of human gliomas. SandbergNordqvist et al., 1993, j~. 53:2475-2478. The importance of IGF-IR and its ligands in cell proliferation is<br>
further supported by the fact that many cell types in culture (fibroblasts, epithelial cells, smooth muscle cells, Tlymphocytes, myeloid cells, chondrocytes and osteoblasts (the stem cells of the bone marrow)) are stimulated to grow by IGF<br><br>
I.	Goldring and Goldring, 1991, Eukarvotic Gene Exrression,1:301-326. In a series of recent publications, Baserga suggests that IGF-IR plays a central role in the mechanism of transformation and, as such, could be a preferred target for therapeutic interventions for a broad spectrum of human malignancies. Baserga, 1995, Cancer Res., 55:249-252, Baserga, 1994, ~JJ~ 79:927-930, Coppola et al., 1994, M~.L. Cell. Biol., 14:4588-4595.<br><br>
STKs have been implicated in many types of cancer including, notably, breast cancer (Cance, et al., ~ Cancer, 54:571-77 (1993)).<br><br>
The association between abnormal PlC activity and disease is not restricted to cancer. For example, RTKs have been associated with diseases such as psoriasis, diabetes mellitus, endometriosis, angiogenesis, atheromatous plaque development, Alzheimer's disease, von Hippel-Lindau disease, epidermal hyperproliferation, neurodegenerative diseases, age-related rnacular degeneration and hemangiomas. For example, EGFR has been indicated in corneal and dermal wound healing. Defects in Insulin-R and IGF-1R are indicated in type-Il diabetes inellitus. A more complete correlation between specific RTKs and their therapeutic indications is set forth in Plowman et<br><br>
al., 1994, DN&amp;P 7:334-339.<br><br>
As noted previously, not only RTKs but CTKs including, but not limited to, src, abl, fps, yes, fyn, lyn, lck, blk, hck, fgr and yrk (reviewed by Bolen et al., 1992, FASEB J., 6:3403-3409) are involved in the proliferative and metabolic signal transduction pathway and thus could be expected, and have been shown, to be involve.d in mary PTK-mediated disorders to which the<br><br>
present invention is directed. For example, mutated src (v-src) has been shown to be an oncoprotein (pp5QVrc) in chicken. Moreover its cellular homolog, the proto-oncogene ppGo~src transmits oncogenic signals of many receptors. Over-expression of EGFR or HER2/neu in tumors leads to the constitutive activation of pp6O~rc, which is characteristic of malignant cells but absent in normal cells. On the other hand, mice deficient in the expression of c-src exhibit an osteopetrotic phenotype, indicating a key participation of c-src in osteoclast function and a possible involvement in related disorders.<br><br>
Similarly, Zap7O has been implicated in T-cell signaling which may relate to autoimmune disorders.<br><br>
STlCs have been associated with inflamation, autoimmune disease, immunoresponses, and hyperproliferation disorders such as restenosis, fibrosis, psoriasis, osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.<br><br>
PKs have also been implicated in embryo implantation. Thus, the compounds of this invention may provide an effective method of preventing such embryo implantation and thereby be useful as birth control agents.<br><br>
Finally, both RTKs and CTKs are currently suspected as being involved in hyperiinmune disorders.<br><br>
A method for identifying a chemical compound that modulates the catalytic activity of one or more of the above discussed protein kinases is another aspect of this invention. The method involves contacting cells expressing the desired protein kinase with a compound of this invention (or its salt or prodrug) and monitoring the cells for any effect that the compound has on them. The effect may be any observable, either to the naked eye or through the use of instrumentation, change or absence of change in a cell phenotype. The change or absence of change in the cell phenotype monitored may be, for example, without limitation, a change or absence of change<br><br>
in the catalytic activity of the protein kinase in the cells or a change or absence of change in the interaction of the proteiji kinase with a natural binding partner.<br><br>
Examples of the effect of a number of exemplary compounds of this invention on several PTlCs are shown in Tables 1 and 2 and in the Biological Examples section, below The compounds and data presented are not to be construed as limiting the scope of this invention in any manner whatsoever.<br><br>
5.	PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS AND USE<br><br>
A compound of the present invention, a prodrug thereof or a physiologically acceptable salt of either the compound or its prodrug, can be administered as such to a human patient or can be administered in pharmaceutical compositions in which the foregoing materials are mixed with suitable carriers or excipient(s). Techniques for formulation and administration of drugs may be found in "Remington's Pharmacological Sciences," Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA, latest edition. Routes of Administration.<br><br>
As used herein, "administer" or "administration" refers to the delivery of a compound, salt or prodrug of the present invention or of a pharmaceutical composition containing a compound, salt or prodrug of this invention to an organism for the purpose of prevention or treatment of a PlC-related disorder.<br><br>
Suitable routes of administration may include, without limitation, oral, rectal, transmucosal or intestinal administration or intramuscular, subcutaneous, intramedullary, intrathecal, direct intraventricular, intravenous, intravitreal, intraperitoneal, intranasal, or intraocular injections. The preferred routes of administration ary oral arid parenteral.<br><br>
Alternatively, one may administer the compound in a local rather than systemic manner, for example, via injection of the<br><br>
compound directly into a solid tumor, often in a depot or sustained release formulation.<br><br>
Furthermore, one may administer the drug in a targeted drug delivery system, for example, in a liposome coated with tumor-specific antibody. The liposomes will be targeted to and taken up selectively by the tumor. Composition/Formulation.<br><br>
Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be manufactured by processes well known in the art, e.g., by means of conventional mixing, dissolving, granulating, drageemaking, levigating, emulsifying, encapsulating, entrapping or lyophilizing processes.<br><br>
Pharmaceutical compositions for use in accordance with the present invention may be formulated in conventional manner using one or more physiologically acceptable carriers comprising excipients and auxiliaries which facilitate processing of the active compounds into preparations which can be used pharmaceutically. Proper formulation is dependent upon the route of administration chosen.<br><br>
For injection, the compounds of the invention may be formulated in aqueous solutions, preferably in physiologically compatible buffers such as Hanks' solution, Ringer's solution, or physiological saline buffer. For transmucosal administration, penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation. Such penetrants are generally known in the art.<br><br>
For oral administration, the compounds can be formulated by combining the active compounds with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers well known in the art. Such carriers enable the compounds of the invention to be formulated as tablets, pills, lozenges, dragees, capsules, liquids, gels, syrups, slurries, suspensions and the like, for oral ingestion by a patient. Pharmaceutical preparations for oral use can be<br><br>
made using a solid excipient, optionally grinding the resulting mixture, and processing the mixture of granules, after adding other suitable auxiliaries if desired, to obtain tablets or dragee cores. Useful excipients are, in particular, fillers such as sugars, including lactose, sucrose., mannitol, or sorbitol, cellulose preparations such as, for example, maize starch, wheat starch, rice starch and potato starch and other materials such as gelatin, gum tragacanth, methyl cellulose, hydroxypropylinethyl- cellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, and/or polyvinyl- pyrrolidone (PVP). If desired, disintegrating agents may be added, such as cross-linked polyvinyl pyrrolidone, agar, or alginic acid. A salt such as sodium alginate may also be used.<br><br>
Dragee cores are provided with suitable coatings. For this purpose, concentrated sugar solutions may be used which may optionally contain gum arabic, talc, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, carbopol gel, polyethylene glycol, and/or titanium dioxide, lacquer solutions, and suitable organic solvents or solvent mixtures. Dyestuffs or pigments may be added to the tablets or dragee coatings for identification or to characterize different combinations of active compound doses.<br><br>
Pharmaceutical compositions which can be used orally include push-fit capsules made of gelatin, as well as soft, sealed capsules made of gelatin and a plasticizer, such as glycerol or sorbitol. The push-fit capsules can contain the active ingredients in admixture with a filler such as lactose, a binder such as starch, and/or a lubricant such as talc or magnesium stearate and, optionally, stabilizers. In soft capsules, the active compounds may be dissolved or suspended in suitable liquids, such as fatty oils, liquid paraffin, or liquid polyethylene glycols. Stabilizers may be added in these formulations, also.<br><br>
For administration by inhalation, the compounds for use according to the present invention are conveniently delivered in the? form of an aerosol spray using a pressurized pack or a nebulizer and a suitable propellant, e.g., without limitation, dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetra- fluoroethane or carbon dioxide. In the case of a pressurized aerosol, the dosage unit may be controlled by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. Capsules and cartridges of, for example, gelatin for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated containing a powder mix of the compound and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch.<br><br>
The compounds may also be formulated for parenteral administration, e.g., by bolus injection or continuous infusion. Formulations for injection may be presented in unit dosage form, e.g., in ampoules or in multi-dose containers, with an added preservative. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulating materials such as suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents.<br><br>
Pharmaceutical compositions for parenteral administration include aqueous solutions of a water soluble form, such as, without limitation, a salt, of the active compound. Additionally, suspensions of the active compounds may be prepared in a lipophilic vehicle. Suitable lipophilic vehicles include fatty oils such as sesame oil, synthetic fatty acid esters such as ethyl oleate and triglycerides, or materials such as liposomes. Aqueous injection suspensions may contain substances which increase the viscosity of the suspension, such as sodium carbo2cyinethyl cellulose, sorbitol, or dextran. Optionally, the suspension may also contain suitable stabilizers and/or agents that increase the solubility of the compounds to allow for the preparation of highly concentrated solutions.<br><br>
Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form for constitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g., sterile, pyrogen--free water, before use.<br><br>
The compounds may also be formulated in rectal compositions such as suppositories or retention enemas, using, e.g., conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other glycerides.<br><br>
In addition to the foinulations described previously, the compounds may also be formulated as depot preparations. Such long acting formulations may be administered by implantation (for example, subcutaneously or intramuscularly) or by intramuscular injection. A compound of this invention may be formulated for this route of administration with suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials (for instance, in an emulsion with a pharaincologically acceptable oil), with ion exchange resins, or as a sparingly soluble derivative such as, without limitation, a sparingly soluble salt.<br><br>
A non-limiting example of a pharmaceutical carrier for the hydrophobic compounds of the invention is a cosolvent system comprising benzyl alcohol, a nonpolar surfactant, a water-miscible organic polymer and an aqueous phase such as the VPD co-solvent system. VPD is a solution of 3% w/v berizyl alcohol, 8% w/v of the nonpolar surf actant Polysorbate 80TM, and 65% w/v polyethylene glycol 300, made up to volume in absolute ethanol. The VPD co-solvent system (VPD:D5W) consists of VPD diluted 1:1 with a 5% dextrose in water solution. This co-solvent system dissolves hydrophobic compounds well, and itself produces low toxicity upon systemic administration. Naturally, the proportions of such a cosolvent system may be varied considerably without destroying its solubility and toxicity characteristics. Furthermore, the identity of the co-solvent components may be varied: for example, other low-toxicity nonpolar surfactants may be used<br>
instead of Polysorbate 8QTM, the fraction size of polyethylene glycol may be varied, other biocompatible polymers may replace polyethylene glycol, e.g., polyvinyl pyrrolidone., and other sugars or polysaccharides may substitute for dextrose.<br><br>
Alternatively, other delivery systems for hydrophobic pharmaceutical compounds may be employed. Liposomes and emulsions are well known examples of delivery vehicles or carriers for hydrophobic drugs. In addtion, certain organic solvents such as dimethylsulfoxide also may be employed, although often at the cost of greater toxicity.<br><br>
Additionally, the compounds may be delivered using a sustained-release system, such as semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the therapeutic agent. Various sustained-release materials have been established and are well known by those skilled in the art. Sustained-release capsules may, depending on their chemical nature, release the compounds for a few weeks up to over 100 days. Depending on the chemical nature and the biological stability of the therapeutic reagent, additional strategies for protein stabilization may be employed.<br><br>
The pharmaceutical compositions herein also may comprise suitable solid or gel phase carriers or excipients. Examples of such carriers or excipients include, but are not limited to, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, various sugars, starches, cellulose derivatives, gelatin, and polymers such as polyethylene glycols.<br><br>
Many of the PK modulating compounds of the invention may be provided as physiologically acceptable salts wherein the claimed compound may form the negatively or the positively charged species. Examples of salts in which the compound forms the positively charged moiety include, without limitation, quaternary ammonium (defined elsewhere herein), salts such as the hydrochloride, sulfate, carbonate, lactate,<br><br>
tartrate, maleate, succinate wherein the nitrogen atom of the quaternary aminonium group is a nitrogen of the selected compound of this invention which has reacted with the appropriate acid. Salts in which a compound of this invention forms the negatively charged species include, without limitation, the sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium salts formed by the reaction of a carboxylic acid group in the compound with an appropriate base (e.g. sodium hydroxide (NaOH), potassium hydroxide (KOR), Calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) etc.).<br><br>
Dosage.<br><br>
Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for use in the present invention include compositions wherein the active ingredients are contained in an amount sufficient to achieve the intended purpose, i.e., the modulation of PlC activity or the treatment or prevention of a PlC-related disorder.<br><br>
More specifically, a therapeutically effective amount means an amount of compound effective to prevent, alleviate or ameliorate symptoms of disease or prolong the survival of the subject being treated.<br><br>
Determination of a therapeutically effective amount is well within the capability of those skilled in the art, especially in light of the detailed disclosure provided herein.<br><br>
For any compound used in the methods of the invention, the therapeutically effective amount or dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. Then, the dosage can be formulated for use in animal models so as to achieve a circulating concentration range that includes the IC50 as determined in cell culture (i.e., the concentration of the test compound which achieves a half-maximal inhibition of the PlC activity). Such information can then be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans.<br>
Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of the compounds described herein can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., by determining the IC50 and the LD~ (both of which are discussed elsewhere herein) for a subject compound. The data obtained from these cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in humans. The dosage may vary depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. The exact formulation, route of administration and dosage can be chosen by the individual physician in view of the patient's condition. (See e.g., Fingl, et al., 1975, in "The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics", Ch. 1 p.1).<br><br>
Dosage amount and interval may be adjusted individually to provide plasma levels of the active species which are sufficient to maintain the kinase modulating effects. These plasma levels are referred to as minimal effective concentrations (MECs). The MEC will vary for each compound but can be estimated from ~ yj.~ data, e.g., the concentration necessary to achieve 50-90% inhibition of a kinase may be ascertained using the assays described herein. Dosages necessary to achi~ve the MEC will depend on individual characteristics and route of administration. HPLC assays or bioassays can be used to determine plasma concentrations.<br><br>
Dosage intervals can also be determined using MEC value. Compounds should be administered using a regimen that maintains plasma levels above the MEC for 10-90% of the time, preferably between 30-90% and most preferably between 50-90%.<br><br>
In cases of local administration or selective uptake, the effective local concentration of the drug may not be related to plasma concentration and other procedures known in the art may be employed to determine the correct dosage amount and interval.<br>
The amount of a composition administered will, of course, be dependent on the subject being treated, the severity of the affliction, the manner of administration, the judgment of the prescribing physician, etc.<br><br><br>
The compositions may, if desired, be presented in a pack or dispenser device, such as an FDA approved kit, which may contain one or more unit dosage forms containing the active ingredient. The pack may for example comprise metal or plastic foil, such as a blister pack. The pack or dispenser device may be accompanied by instructions for administration. The pack or dispenser may also be accompanied by a notice associated with the container in a form prescribed by a governmental agency regulating the manufacture, use or sale of pharmaceuticals, which notice is reflective of approval by the agency of the form of the compositions or of human or veterinary administration. Such notice, for example, may be of the labeling approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for prescription drugs or of an approved product insert. Compositions comprising a compound of the invention formulated in a compatible pharmaceutical carrier may also be prepared, placed in an appropriate container, and labeled for treatment of an indicated condition. Suitable conditions indicated on the label may include treatment of a tumor, inhibition of angiogenesis, treatment of fibrosis, diabetes, and the like.<br><br>

7. BIOLOGICAL EVALUATION<br><br>
It will be appreciated that, in any given series of compounds, a spectrum of biological activity will be afforded. In its presently preferred embodiments, this invention relates to novel pyrrole substituted 2-indolinones demonstrating the ability to modulate RTK, CTK, and STlC activity. The following assays are employed to select those compounds demonstrating the optimal<br><br>
degree of the desired activity.<br><br>
A. Assay Procedures.<br><br>
The- following j11 vitro assays may be used to determine the level of activity and effect of the different compounds of the present invention on one or more of the PlCs. Similar assays can be designed along the same lines for any PlC using techniques Well known in the art.<br><br>
The cellular/catalytic assays described herein are performed in an ELISA format. The general procedure is as follows: a compound is introduced to cells expressing the test kinase, either naturally or recombinantly, for a selected period of time after which, if the test kinase is a receptor, a ligand known to activate the receptor is added. The cells are lysed and the lysate is transferred to the wells of an ELISA plate previously coated with a specific antibody recognizing the substrate of the enzymatic phosphorylation reaction. Non-substrate components of the'1 cell lysate are washed away and the amount of phosphorylation on the substrate is detected with an antibody specifically recognizing phosphotyrosine compared with control cells that were not contacted with a test compound. The cellular/biologic assays described herein measure the amount of DNA made in response to activation of a test kinase, which is a general measure of a proliferative response. The general procedure for this assay is as follows: a compound is introduced to cells expressing the test kinase, either naturally or recombinantly, for a selected period of time after which, if the test kinase is a receptor, a ligand known to activate the receptor is added. After incubation at least overnight, a DNA labeling reagent such as Bromodeoxyuridine CBrdU) or 3M-thymidine is added. The amount of labeled DNA is detected with either an antiBrdU antibody or by measuring radioactivity and is compared<br><br>
to control cells not contacted with a test compound. Cellular/Catalytic Assays<br><br>
Enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) may be used to detect and measure the presence of PlC activity. The ELISA may be conducted according to known protocols which are described in, for example, Voller, et al., 1980, "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay," In: Manual of Clinical Immunology, 2d ed.., edited by Rose and Friedman, pp 359-371 Am. Soc. Of Microbiology., Washington, D.C.<br><br>
The disclosed protocol may be adapted for determining activity with respect to a specific PlC. That is, the preferred protocols for conducting the ELISA experiments for specific PKs is provided below. However, adaptation of these protocols for determining a compound's activity for other members of the RTK family, as well as for CTKs and STlCs, is well within the scope of knowledge of those skilled in the art.<br><br>
FLX-1 Assay<br><br>
An ELISA assay is conducted to measure the kinase activity of the FLK-1 receptor and more specifically, the inhibition or activation of TK activity on the FLlC-i receptor. Specifically, the following assay can be conducted to measure kinase activity of the FLlC-1 receptor in cells genetically engineered to express Fik-l.<br><br>

DAY 0<br><br>
1.	Wash and trypsinize MtJV-EC-C cells (human umbilical vein endothelial cells, (American Type Culture Collection, catalogue no. 1730 CRL) . Wash with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline CD-PBS, obtained from Gibco BRL, catalogue no. 14190-029) 2 times at about I nil/lO cm2 of tissue culture flask. Trypsinize with 0.05% trypsin-EDTA in non-enzymatic cell dissociation solution (Sigma Chemical Company, catalogue no. C-1544) . The 0.05% trypsin is made by diluting 0.25% trypsin/1 mM EDTA (Gibco, catalogue no. 25200-049) in the cell dissociation solution. Trypsinize with about 1 ml/25-30 cm2 of tissue culture flask for about 5 minutes at 37W. After cells have detached from the flask, add an equal volume of assay medium and transfer to a 50 ml sterile centrifuge tube (Fisher Scientific, catalogue no. 05-539-6)<br><br>
2.	Wash the cells with about 35 ml assay medium in the<br><br>
50 ml sterile centrifuge tube by adding the assay medium, centrifuge for 10 minutes at approximately 200x g, aspirate the supernatant, and resuspend with 35 ml D-PBS. Repeat the wash two more times with D-PBS, resuspend the cells in about 1 ml assay medium/iS cm2 of tissue culture flask. Assay medium consists of Fl2K medium (Gibco BRL, catalogue no. 21127-014) and 0.5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Count the cells with a Coulter Counter® (Coulter Electronics, Inc.) and add assay medium to the cells to obtain a concentration of 0.8-1.0<br><br><br>
3.	Add cells to 96-well flat-bottom plates at 100 p1/well or 0.8-1.0 x l0~ cells/well, incubate —24h at 370C, 5% CO2.<br><br>
DAY 1<br><br>
1.	Make up two-fold test compound titrations in separate 96-well plates, generally 50 pM on down to 0 pM. Use<br><br>
the same assay medium as mentioned in day 0, step 2 above. Titrations are made by adding 90 p1/well of test compound at 200 pM (4X the final well concentration) to the top well of a particular plate column. Since the stock test compound is usually 20 mM in DM80, the 200 pM drug concentration contains 2% DM50.<br><br>
A diluent made up to 2% DMSO in assay medium CF12K + 0.5% fetal bovine serum) is used as diluent for the test compound titrations in order to dilute the test compound but keep the DMSO concentration constant. Add this diluent to the remaining wells in the column at 60 p1/well. Take 60 p1 from the 120 p1 of 200 pM test compound dilution in the top well of the column and mix with the 60 p1 in the second well of the column. Take 60 p1 from this well and mix with the 60 p1 in the third well of the column, and so on until two-fold titrations are completed. When the next-to-the-last well is mixed, take 60 p1 of the 120 p1 in this well and discard it. Leave the last well with 60 p1 of DMSO/media diluent as a non-test compound-containing control. Make 9 columns of titrated test compound, enough for triplicate wells each for: Cl) VEGF Cobtainedfrom Pepro Tech Inc., catalogue no. 100-200, (2) endothelial cell growth factor CECGF) (also known as acidic fibroblast growth factor, or aFGF) (obtained from Boehringer Manriheim Biochemica, catalogue no. 1439 600), or, (3) human PDGF B/B (1276-956, Boehringer Marinheim, Germany) and assay media control. ECGF comes as a preparation with sodium heparin.<br><br>
2.	Transfer 50 p1/well of the test compound dilutions to the 96-well assay plates containing the 0.8-1.0x104 cells/l0o p1/well of the HUV-EC-C cells from day 0 and incubate -2 h at 370 C, 5% CO2.<br><br><br>
3.	In triplicate, add 50 p1/well of 80 pg/nil VEGF, 20 ng/ml ECGF, or media control to each test compound condition. As wittr the test compounds, the growth factor concentrations are 4X the desired final concentration. Use the assay media from day 0 step 2 to make the concentrations of growth factors. Incubate approximately 24 hours at 370C, 5% CO2. Each well will have 50 p1 test compound dilution, 50 p1 growth factor or media, and 100 p1 cells, which calculates to 200 p1/well total. Thus the 4X concentrations of test compound and growth factors become lX once everything has been added to the wells.<br><br>
DAY 2<br><br>
1.	Add 3H-thymidine (Amersham, catalogue no. TRlC-686) at<br><br>

In VIvo Animal Models<br><br>
Xeno~raft Animal Models<br><br>
The ability of human tumors to grow as xenografts in athymic mice (e.g., Balb/c, nu/nu) provides a useful j~ vivo model for studying the biological response to therapies for human tumors. Since the first successful xenotransplantation of human tumors into athymic mice, CRygaard and Povlsen, 1969, Acta Pathol. Microbial. Scand. 77:758-760), many different<br><br>
human tumor cell lines (e.g., mammary, lung, genitourinary, gastro-intestinal, head and neck, glioblastoma, bone, and malignant-melanomas) have been transplanted and successfully grown in nude mice. The following assays may be used to determine the level of activity, specificity and effect of the different compounds of the present invention. Three general types of assays are useful for evaluating compounds:<br><br>
cellular/catalytic, cellular/biological and in vivo. The object of the cellular/catalytic assays is to determine the effect of a compound on the ability of a TK to phosphorylate tyrosines on a known substrate in a cell. The object of the cellular/biological assays is to determine the effect of a compound on the biological response stimulated by a TK in a cell. The object of the in vivo assays is to determine the effect of a compound in an animal model of a particular disorder such as cancer.<br><br>
Suitable cell lines for subcutaneous xenograft experiments include C6 cells (glioma, ATCC # CCL 107), A375 cells (melanoma, ATCC # CRL 1619)., A431 cells Cepidermoid carcinoma, ATCC # CRL 1555), Calu 6 cells Clung, ATCC # HTB 56), PC3 cells (prostate, ATCC # CRL 1435), SKOV3TP5 cells and NIH 3T3 fibroblasts genetically engineered to overexpress EGFR, PDGFR, IGF-1R or any other test kinase. The following protocol can be used to perform xenograft experiments:<br><br>
Female athymic mice (BALE/c, nu/nu) are obtained from Simonsen Laboratories CGilroy, CA). All animals are maintained under clean-room conditions in Micro-isolator cages with Alpha-dri bedding. They receive sterile rodent chow and water ad libitum.<br><br>
Cell lines are grown in appropriate medium (for example, MEM, DMEM, Ham's FlO, or Ham's F12 plus 5% - 10% fetal bovine serum CFBS) and 2 mM glutamine (GLN)) . All cell culture media., glutamine, and fetal bovine serum are purchased from Gibco<br><br>
Life Technologies (Grand Island, NY) unless otherwise specified. All cells are grown in a humid atmosphere of 90-95% air-and 5-10% CO2 at 370C. All cell lines are routinely subcultured twice a week and are negative for mycoplasma as determined by the Mycotect method (Gibco).<br><br>
Cells are harvested at or near confluency with 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA and pelleted at 450 x g for 10 mm. Pellets are resuspended in sterile PBS or media Cwithout FBS) to a particular concentration and the cells are implanted into the hindflank of the mice (8 - 10 mice per group, 2 - 10 x 106 cells/animal). Tumor growth is measured over 3 to 6 weeks using venier calipers. Tumor volumes are calculated as a product of length x width x height unless otherwise indicated. P values are calculated using the Students t-test. Test compounds in 50 - 100 pL excipient CDMSO, or VPD:DSW) can be delivered by I? injection at different concentrations generally starting at day one after implantation.<br><br>
Tumor Invasion Model<br><br>
The following tumor invasion model has been developed and may be used for the evaluation of therapeutic value and efficacy of the compounds identified to selectively inhibit KDR/FLK-l - receptor.<br><br>
Procedure<br><br>
8 week old nude mice (female) (Simonsen Inc.) are used as experimental animals. Implantation of tumor cells can be performed in a laminar flow hood. For anesthesia, Xylazine/Ketamine Cocktail (100 mg/kg ketamine and 5 mg/kg Xylazine) are administered intraperitoneally. A midline incision is done to expose the abdominal cavity (approximately 1.5 cm in length) to inject 1Q~ tumor cells in a volume of 100 p1 medium. The cells are injected either into the duodenal lobe of the pancreas or under the serosa of the colon. The peritoneum and muscles are closed with a<br><br>
6-0	silk continuous suture and the skin is closed by using wound clips. Animals are observed daily.<br><br>
Analysis<br><br>
After 2-6 weeks, depending on gross obse±-vations of the animals, the mice are sacrificed, and the local tumor metastases to various organs (lung, liver, brain, stomach, spleen, heart, muscle) are excised and analyzed (measurement of tumor size, grade of invasion, immunochemistry, j~ situ hybridization determination, etc.)<br><br>
Measurement Of Cell Toxicity<br><br>
Therapeutic compounds should be more potent in inhibiting receptor tyrosine kinase activity than in exerting a cytotoxic effect. A measure of the effectiveness and cell toxicity of a compound can be obtained by determining the therapeutic index, i.e.., IC~0/LD50. IC50, the dose required to achieve 50% inhibition, can be measured using standard techniques such as those described herein. LD50 the dosage which results in 50% toxicity, can also be measured by standard techniques as wellCMossnian, 1983, ~. Immunol. Methods, 65:55-63), by measuring the amount of LDH released (Korzeniewski and Callewaert, 1983, J. Immunol. Methods, 64:313., Decker and Lohmann-Matthes, 1988, J. Immunol. Methods, 115:61), or by measuring the lethal dose in animal models. Compounds with a large therapeutic index are preferred. The therapeutic index should be greater than 2, preferably at least 10, more preferably at least 50.<br><br>
B.	Examples - Biological Activity.<br><br>
Examples of the j~ vitro potency of compounds of this invention are shown in Tables 1 and 2. The data show that the compounds are generally quite potent against a variety of PTKs in vitro. The compounds also maintain excellent activity when tested ~ y~. For example several compounds of the present invention, when administered orally, exhibit a marked reduced average size of C6 gliorna tumors subcutaneously<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
As shown in the following graph, all of the compounds tested show a marked inhibition compared to the vehicle-only control. However, compound S clearly and, considering the close structural similarity of the compounds tested, surprisingly stands out from the rest. That is, while compounds 3, 3.9 and 21 cluster around 40 - 45% inhibition of tumor growth at day 18 post-implantation, compound 5 inhibits tumor growth by 80 - 85% at that point.<br><br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
The unexpected efficacy of compound 5 in vivo, particularly upon oral administration, is further demonstrated when it is compared to compound 65:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Compound 65 manifests almost an order of magnitude greater potency j~ vitro than compound 5 (data not shown). However, when tested interpertitoneally in mice against two<br>
different tumor cells lines, 5F763T and SF767T, compound 5 is from slightly (5% greater inhibition at 21 days) to notably (3.4% greater inhibition at 21 days) more efficacious than compound 65.<br><br>
The difference in activity between compound 5 and compound 65 is even greater when the two compounds are administered orally. The oral efficacy of compound 65 and several of its analogs, compounds 66 - 69, is shown graphically below:<br><br><br>

As can be seen from the graph, compound 65,administered orally at 200 mg/kg/day, shows approximately 65% inhibition of CE tumors at 18 days post subcutaneous implantation in mice, which is clearly superior to its own analogs, which average about 14 - 16% inhibition of tumor growth. Surprisingly, however, the oral efficacy of compound 65 is still remarkably less than that of compound 5, which, as noted above, demonstrates 80-85% inhibition at the same time in the same tumor model.<br><br>
When compared to compound 70, compound 5 shows significantly smaller (i.e., greater potency) K~'s (inhibition constants) against FGF-R1 (1.2 for compound S versus 3.9.49 for compound 70)and PDGFR (data not shown).<br>
The unexpected superiority of compound 5 is further demonstrated when its oral efficacy is compared to that of a close analog, compound 71:<br><br><br><br>
Despite the structural similarity, when tested orally at 200 mg/kg/day against subcutaneously implanted CE human melanoma tumors in BALB/c nu/nu mice, at 18 days post implantation compound 73. shows only a 57% inhibition of tumor growth (data not shown) compared, again, to the 80-85% inhibition demonstrated by compound 5.<br><br>
Based on the above surprising efficacy of compound 5 when administered orally, compound 5 is presently a preferred embodiment of this invention.<br>

FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br><br><br>
The invention relates to a novel pyrrole substituted 2-indolinone compounds having the chemical structure as described herein:<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The invention further relates generally to organic chemistry, biochemistry, pharmacology and medicine. More particularly, it relates to novel pyrrole substituted 2-indolinole compounds, and their physiologically acceptable salts and prodrugs, which modulate the activity of protein kinases ("PKs") and thus are expected to exhibit a salutary effect against disorders related to abnormal PK activity.<br><br><br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br><br><br>
The following is offered as background information only and is not admitted to be prior art to the present invention.<br><br><br>
PKs are enzymes that catalyze the phosphorylation of hydroxyl groups on tyrosine, serine and threonine residues of proteins. The consequences of this seemingly simple activity are staggering; cell growth, differentiation and proliferation, i.e., virtually all aspects of cell life in one way or another depend on PK activity. Furthermore, abnormal PK activity has been related to a host of disorders, ranging from reiatively non-life threatening diseases such as psoriasis to extremely virulent diseases such as glioblastoma (brain cancer).<br><br>
The PKs can be conveniently be broken down into two classes, the protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) and the serinethreon~ine kinases (STKs).<br><br>
One of the prime aspects of PTK activity is their involvement with growth factor receptors. Growth factor receptors are cell-surface proteins. When bound by a growth factor ligand, growth factor receptors are converted to an active form which interacts with proteins on the inner surface of a cell membrane. This leads to phosphorylation on tyrosine residues of the receptor and other proteins and to the formation inside the cell of complexes with a variety of cytoplasmic signaling molecules that, in turn, effect numerous cellular responses such as cell division (proliferation), cell differentiation1 cell growth, expression of metabolic effects to the extracellular microenvironment, etc. For a more complete discussion, see Schiessinger and Ulirich, ~ 9:303-391 (1992) which is incorporated by reference, including any drawings, as if fully set forth herein.<br><br>
Growth factor receptors with PTK activity are known as receptor tyrosine kinases ("RTKs") . They comprise a large family of transmembrane receptors with diverse biological activity. At present, at least nineteen (19) distinct subfamilies of RTKs have been identified. An example of these is the subfamily designated the "HER" RTKs, which include EGFR (epithelial growth factor receptor), HER2, HER3 and HER4. These RTKS consist of an extracellular glycosylated ligand binding domain, a transmernbrane domain and an intracellular cytoplasmic catalytic domain that can phosphorylate tyrosine residues on proteins.<br><br>
Another RTK subfamily consists of insulin receptor (IR), insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-lR) and insulin receptor related receptor (IRR). IR and IGF-IR interact with insulin, IGF-I and IGF-II to form a heterotetramer of two<br>
entirely extracellular glycosylated a subunits and two ~3 subunits which cross the cell membrane and which contain the tyros.ine kinase domain.<br><br>
A third RTX subfamily is referred to as the platelet derived growth factor receptor ("PDGFR~) group, which includes PDGFRa, PDGFRj3, CSFIR, c-kit and c-fins. These receptors consist of glycosylated extracellular domains composed of variable numbers of immunoglobin-like loops and an intracellular domain wherein the tyrosine kinase domain is interrupted by unrelated amino acid sequences.<br><br>
Another group which, because of its similarity to the PDGPR subfamily, is sometimes subsumed into the later group is the fetus liver kinase ("f 1k") receptor subfamily. This group is believed to be made of up of kinase insert domain-receptor fetal liver kinase-l (KDR/FLK-l), fik-iR, flk-4 and fins-like tyrosine kinase 1 (flt-l).<br><br>
A further member of the tyrosine kinase growth factor receptor family is the fibroblast growth factor ("FGF") receptor subgroup. This group consists of four receptors, FGFRl-4, and seven ligands, FGF1-7. While not yet well defined, it appears that the receptors consist of a glycosylated extracellular domain containing a variable number of immunoglobin-like loops and an intracellular domain in which the tyrosine kinase sequence is interrupted by regions of unrelated amino acid sequences.<br><br>
Still another member of the tyrosine kinase growth factor receptor family is the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF't) receptor subgroup. VEGF is a dimeric glycoprotein similar to PDGF but has different biological functions and target cell specificity ~ vivo. In particular, VEGF is presently thought to play an essential role is vasculogenesis and angiogenesis.<br>
A more complete listing of the known RTK subfamilies is described in Plowman et al., ~ 7(6):334-339 (1994) which is incorporated by reference, including any drawings, as if fully set forth herein.<br><br>
In addition to the RTKs, there also exists a family of entirely intracellular PTKs called "non-receptor tyrosine kinases" or "cellular tyrosine kinases." This latter designation, abbreviated "CTK," will be used herein. CTKs do not contain extracellular and transinembrane domains. At present, ove: 24 CTKs in 11 subfamilies (Src, Frk, Btk, Csk, Abl, Zap7o, Fes, Fps, Fak, Jak and Ack) have been identified. The Src subfamily appear so far to be the largest group of CTKs and includes Src, Yes, Fyn, Lyn, Lck, Blk, Hck, Fgr and Yrk. For a more detailed discussion of CTKs, see Bolen, ~ 8:2025-2031 (1993), which is incorporated by reference, including any drawings, as if fully set forth herein.<br><br>
The serine/threonine kinases, STKs, like the CTKs, are predominantly intracellular although there are a few receptor kinases of the STK type. STKS are the most common of the cytosolic kinases; i.e., kinases that perform their function in that part of the cytoplasm other than the cytoplasmic organelles and cytoskelton. The cytosol is the region within the cell where much of the cell's intermediary metabolic and biosynthetic activity occurs; e.g., it is in the cytosol that proteins are synthesized on ribosomes.<br><br>
RTKS, CTKs and STKs have all been implicated in a host of pathogenic conditions including, significantly, cancer. Other pathogenic conditions which have been associated with PTKs include, without limitation, psoriasis, hepatic cirrhosis, diabetes, angiogenesis, restenosis, ocular diseases, rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory disorders, immunological disorders such as autoiminune disease,<br>
cardiovascular disease such as atherosclerosis and a variety of renal disorders.<br><br>
With regard to cancer, two of the major hypotheses advanced to explain the excessive cellular pr6liferation that drives tumor development relate to functions known to be PK regulated. That is, it has been suggested that malignant cell growth results from a breakdown in the mechanisms that control cell division and/or differentiation. It has been shown that the protein products of a number of proto-oncogenes are involved in the signal transduction pathways that regulate cell growth and differentiation. These protein products of proto-oncogenes include the extracellular growth factors, transinembrane growth factor PTK receptors (RTKs), cytoplasmic PTKs (CTKs) and cytosolic STKs, discussed above.<br><br>
In view of the apparent link between PK-related cellular activities and wide variety of human disorders, it is no surprise that a great deal of effort is being expended in an attempt to identify ways to modulate PK activity. Some of these have involved biomimetic approaches using large molecules patterned on those involved in the actual cellular processes (e.g., mutant ligands (U.S. App. No. 4,966,849); soluble receptors and antibodies (App. No. WO 94/10202, Kendall and Thomas, Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci.., 90:10705-09 (1994), Kim, et al., ~ 362:841-844 (1993)); RNA ligands (Jelinek, et al., ~ 33:10450-56); Takano, et al., Mol. Bio. Cell 4:358A (1993); Kinsella, et al., ExD. Cell Res. 199:56-62 (1992); Wright, et al., J. Cellular Phvs., 152:448-<br><br>
57) and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (WO 94/03427; WO 92/21660; WO 91/15495; WO 94/14808; U.S. Pat. No. 5,330,992; Mariani, et al., Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res., 35:2268 (1994)).<br><br>
In addition to the above, attempts have been made to identify small molecules which act as PK inhibitors. For example, bis- monocy)4.c, bicyclic and heterocyclic aryl<br>
compounds (PCT WO 92/20642), vinylene-azaindole derivatives (PCT WO 94/14808) and l-cyclopropyl-4-pyridylquinolones (U.S. Pat. No. 5,330,992) have been described as tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Styryl compounds (U.S. Pat. No. 5,217,999), styrylsubstituted pyridyl compounds (US Pat. No. 5,302,606), quinazoline derivatives (EP App. No. 0 566 266 Al), selenaindoles and selenides (PCT WO 92/21660) and benzylphosphonic acid compounds (PCT WO 9 1/15495) have all been described as PTK inhibitors useful in the treatment of cancer.<br><br>

Our own efforts to identify small organic molecules which modulate PK activity and which, therefore, are expected to be useful in the treatment and prevention of disorders involving abnormal PK activity, has led us to the discovery of a family of novel pyrrole substituted 2-indoline compounds which exhibit PK modulating ability and are thereby expected to have a salutary effect against disorders related to abnormal PK activity; it is these compounds which is the subject of this invention.<br><br>
Thus, the present invention relates generally to novel pyrrole substituted 2-indolinones which modulate the activity of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), non-receptor protein (STKs). In addition, the present invention relates to the preparation and use of pharmaceutical compositions of the disclosed compounds and their physiologically acceptable salts and prodrugs in the treatment or prevention of PK driven disorders such as, by way of example and not limitation, cancer, diabetes, hepatic cirrhosis, cardiovascular disease such as arthrosclerosis, angiogenesis, immunological disease such as autoimmune disease and renal disease.<br>

A "pyrrole~ refers to a molecule having the chemical structure:<br><br>
"Pyrrole substituted 2-indolinone" and "~ -pyrrolidenyl-2-<br><br>
indolinone" are used interchangeably herein to refer to a<br><br>
chemical compound having the general structure shown in<br><br>
Formula 1.<br><br>

administration whereas the parent drug is not. The prodrug may also have improved solubility in pharmaceutical compositions over ~he -parent drug. An example, without limitation, of a prodrug would be a compound of the present invention which is administered as an ester (the "prodrug") to facilitate transmittal across a cell membrane where water solubility is detrimental to mobility but then is metabolically hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid, the active entity, once inside the cell where water solubility is beneficial.<br><br>
A further example of a prodrug might be a short poly~eptide, for example, without limitation, a 2 - 10 amino acid polypeptide, bonded through a terminal amino group to a carboxy group of a compound of this invention wherein the polypeptide is hydrolyzed or metabolized .~.n XiYQ to release the active molecule.<br><br>

A.	General Structural Features.<br><br>
Jn one aspect, the the present invention relate to pyrrole substituted 2-indolinones which, in addition to being otherwise optionally substituted on both the pyrrole and 2-indolinone portions of the compound, are necessarily substituted on the pyrrole moiety with one or more hydrocarbon chains which themselves are substituted with at least one polar group. Physiologically acceptable salts and prodrugs of the claimed compounds are also within the scope of this invention.<br><br>
A "hydrocarbon chain" refers to an alkyl, alkenyl or alkynyl group, as defined herein.<br><br>
A "polar" group refers to a group wherein the nuclei of the atoms covalently bound to each other to form the group do not share the electrons of the covalent bond(s) joining them equally; that is the electron cloud is denser about one atom than another. This results in one end of the covalent bond(s) being relatively negative and the other end relatively positive; i.e., there is a negative pole and a positive pole. Examples of polar groups include, without limitation, hydroxy, alkoxy, carboxy, nitro, cyano, amino, ammonium, amido, ureido, sulfonamido, sulfinyl, sulfonyl, phosphono, morpholino, piperazinyl and tetrazolo.<br><br>
While not being bound to any particular theory, applicants at this time believe that the polar groups may interact electronically, for example, but without limitation, through hydrogen bonds, Van der Walls forces and/or ionic bonds (but not covalent bonding), with the amino acids at a PTK active site. These interactions may assist the molecules of this invention to bind to an active site with sufficient tenacity to interfere with or prevent the natural substrate from entering the site. Polar groups may also contribute to<br>
the selectivity of the compounds; i.e., One polar group may have greater affinity for a PTK binding domain than other polar groups so that the compound containing the first particular polar group is more potent than the compounds containing the other polar groups.<br><br>

The reaction may be carried out in the presence of a base. The base may be an organic or an inorganic base. If an organic base is used, preferably it is a nitrogen base. Examples of organic nitrogen bases include, but are not limited to, diisopropylamine, trimethylamine, triethylamine, aniline, pyridine, 1,8-diazabicyclo(5.4.l]undec-7-ene, pyrrolidine and piperidine.<br><br>
Examples of inorganic bases are, without limitation, ammonia, alkali metal or alkaline earth hydroxides, phosphates, carbonates, bicarbonates, bisulfates and ainides. The alkali metals include, lithium, sodium and potassium while the alkaline earths include calcium, magnesium and barium.<br><br>
In a presently preferred embodiment of this invention, when the solvent is a protic solvent, such as water or alcohol, the base is an alkali metal or an alkaline earth inorganic base, preferably, a alkali metal or an alkaline earth hydroxide.<br><br>
It will be clear to those skilled in the art, based both on known general principles of organic synthesis and on the disclosures herein which base would be most appropriate for the reaction contemplated.<br>
The solvent in which the reaction is carried out may be a protic or an aprotic solvent, preferably it is a protic solvent. A "protic solvent" is a solvent which has hydrogen atom(s) covalently bonded to oxygen or nitrogen atoms which renders the hydrogen atoms appreciably acidic and thus capable of being "shared" with a solute through hydrogen bonding. Examples of protic solvents include, without limitation, water and alcohols.<br><br>
An "aprotic solvent" may be polar or non-polar but, in either case, does not contain acidic hydrogens and therefore is not capable of hydrogen bonding with solutes. Examples, without limitation, of non-polar aprotic solvents, are pentane, hexane, benzene, toluene, methylene chloride and carbon tetrachloride.<br>
Examples of polar aprotic solvents are chloroform, tetrahydrofuran, dimethylsulfoxide and dimethylformamide.<br><br>
In a presently preferred embodiment of this invention, the solvent is a protic solvent, preferably water br an alcohol such as ethanol.<br><br>
The reaction is carried out at temperatures greater than room temperature. The temperature is generally from about 300 C to about 1500 C, preferably about 800C to about 1000 C, most preferable about 750 C to about 850 C, which is about the boiling point of ethanol. By "about" is meant that the temperature range is preferably within 10 degrees Celcius of the indicated temperature, more preferably within 5 degrees Celcius of the indicated temperature and, most preferably, within 2 degrees Celcius of the indicated temperature. Thus, for example, by "about 750 C" is meant 750 C ± 100 C, preferably 750 C ± 50 C and most preferably, 750 C ± 2 C.<br><br>
3.	EIOcHEMISTRY/PHAPMACOTHERAPY<br><br>
Another aspect of this invention relates to a method for the modulation of the catalytic activity of a PK by contacting a PK with a compound of this invention or a physiologically acceptable salt or prodrug thereof.<br><br>
As used herein, "PlC" refers to receptor protein tyrosine kinase (RTKs), non-receptor or "cellular" tyrosine kinase (CTKs) and serine-threonine kinases (STKs).<br><br>
The term "method" refers to manners, means, techniques and procedures for accomplishing a given task including, but not limited to, those manners, means, techniques and procedures either known to, or readily developed from known manners, means, techniques and procedures by, practitioners of the chemical, pharmaceutical, biological, biochemical and medical arts.<br><br>
As used herein, the term "modulation" or "modulating" refers to the alteration of the catalytic activity of RTKs, CTKs and<br>
STKs. In particular, modulating refers to the activation of the catalytic activity of RTKs, CTKs and STKs, preferably the activ~tion or inhibition of the catalytic activity of RTKs, CTKs and STKs, depending on the concentration of the compound or salt to which the RTK, CTK or STK is exposed or, more preferably, the inhibition of the catalytic activity of RTKs, CTKs and STKs.<br><br>
The term "catalytic activity" as used herein refers to the rate of phosphorylation of tyrosine under the influence, direct or indirect, of RTKs and/or CTKs or the phosphorylation of serine and threonine under the influence, direct or indirect, of STKs.<br><br>
The term "contacting" as used herein refers to bringing a compound of this invention and a target PK together in such a manner that the compound can affect the catalytic activity of the PlC, either directly, i.e., by interacting with the kinase itself, or indirectly, i.e., by interacting with another molecule on which the catalytic activity of the kinase is dependent. Such "contacting" can be accomplished ~ vitro," i.e., in a test tube, a petri dish or the like. In a test tube, contacting may involve only a compound and a PlC of interest or it may involve whole cells. Cells may also be maintained or grown in cell culture dishes and contacted with a compound in that environment. In this context, the ability of a particular compound to affect a PK related disorder, i.e., the IC50 of the compound, defined below, can be determined before use of the compounds jn vivo with more complex living organisms is attempted. For cells outside the organism, multiple methods exist, and are well-known to those skilled in the art, to get the PKs in contact with the compounds including, but not limited to, direct cell microinjection and numerous transinembrane carrier techniques.<br><br>
A further aspect of this invention is that the modulation of the catalytic activity of PKs using a compound of this invention may be carried out jfl ~ or .jfl vivo.<br>
"~ vitro" refers to procedures performed in an artificial environment such as, e.g., without limitation, in a test tube or culture medium.<br><br>

As used herein, "PlC related disorder," "PlC driven disorder," and "abnormal PlC activity" all refer to a condition characterized by inappropriate, i.e., under or, more commonly, over, PlC catalytic activity, where the particular PlC can be an RTK, a CTK or an STK. Inappropriate catalytic activity can arise as the result of either: (1) PlC expression in cells which normally do not express PI(s, (2) increased PlC expression leading to unwanted cell proliferation, differentiation and/or growth, or, (3) decreased PlC expression leading to unwanted reductions in cell proliferation, differentiation and/or growth. Over-activity of a PlC refers to either amplification of the gene encoding a particular PlC or production of a level of PlC activity which can correlate with a cell proliferation, differentiation and/or growth disorder (that is, as the level of the PK increases, the severity of one or more of the symptoms of the cellular disorder increases). Under-activity is, of course, the converse, wherein the severity of one or more symptoms of a cellular disorder increase as the level of the PlC activity decreases.<br><br>
As used herein, the terms "prevent", "preventing" and "prevention" refer to a method for barring an organism from acquiring a PlC related disorder in the first place.<br><br>
As used herein, the terms "treat", "treating" and<br><br>
"treatment" refer to a method of alleviating or abrogating a PlC mediated cellular disorder and/or its attendant symptoms. With regard particularly to cancer, these terms simply mean that the life expectancy of an individual affected with a cancer will be increased or that one or more of the symptoms of the disease will be reduced.<br>
The term "organism" refers to any living entity comprised of at least one cell. A living organism can be as simple as, for e~xample, a single eukariotic cell or as complex as a mammal, including a human being.<br><br>
The term "therapeutically effective amount" as used herein refers to that amount of the compound being administered which will relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms of the disorder being treated. In reference to the treatment of cancer, a therapeutically effective amount refers to that amount which has the effect of (1) reducing the size of the tumor, (2) inhibiting (that is, slowing to some extent, preferably stopping) tumor metastasis, (3) inhibiting to some extent (that is, slowing to some extent, preferably stopping) tumor growth, and/or, (4) relieving to some extent (or, preferably, eliminating) one or more symptoms associated with the cancer.<br><br>
It is an aspect of this invention that the above-referenced protein kinase related disorder is selected from the group consisting of a receptor protein tyrosine kinase related disorder, a cellular tyrosine kinase disorder and a serine-threonine kinase related disorder.<br><br>
In yet another aspect of this invention, the above referenced protein kinase related disorder is selected from the group consisting of an EGFR related disorder, a PDGFR related disorder, an IGFR related disorder and a f 1k related disorder.<br><br>

By "monitoring" is meant observing or detecting the effect of contacting a compound with a cell expressing a particular PlC. The observed or detected effect can be a chan~e in cell phenotype, in the catalytic activity of a PlC or a change in the interaction of a PlC with a natural binding partner. Techniques for observing or detecting such effects are well-known in the art.<br><br>
The above-referenced effect is selected from a change or an absence of change in a cell phenotype, a change or absence of change in the catalytic activity of said protein kinase or a change or absence of change in the interaction of said protein kinase with a natural binding partner in a final aspect of this invention.<br><br>
"Cell phenotype" refers to the outward appearance of a cell or tissue or the biological function of the cell or tissue. Examples, without limitation, of a cell phenotype are cell size, cell growth, cell proliferation, cell<br>
differentiation, cell survival, apoptosis, and nutrient uptake and use. Such phenotypic characteristics are measurable by techni~ques well-known in the art.<br><br>
A "natural binding partner" refers to a polypeptide that binds to a particular PlC in a cell. Natural binding partners can play a role in propagating a signal in a PlC-mediated signal transduction process. A change in the interaction of the natural binding partner with the PlC can manifest itself as an increased or decreased concentration of the PK/natural binding partner complex and, as a result, in an observable change in the ability of the PlC to mediate signal transduction.<br><br>

2. INDICATIONS/TARGET DISEASES<br><br>
The PlCs whose catalytic activity is modulated by the compounds of this invention include protein tyrosine kinases of which there are two types, receptor tyrosine kinases (RTlCs) and cellular tyrosine kinases (CTKs), and serine-threonine kinases (STKs). RTlC mediated signal transduction, is initiated by extracellular interaction with a specific growth factor (ligand), followed by receptor dimerization, transient stimulation of the intrinsic protein tyrosine kinase activity and phosphorylation. Binding sites are thereby created for intracellular signal transduction molecules and lead to the formation of complexes with a spectrum of cytoplasmic signaling molecules that facilitate the appropriate cellular response (e.g., cell division, metabolic effects on the extracellular microenvironment, etc.) . See, Schlessinger and Ullrich, 1992, Neuron 9:303-391.<br><br>
It has been shown that tyrosine phosphorylation sites on growth factor receptors function as high-affinity binding sites for SH2 (src homology) domains of signaling molecules. Fantl et al., 1992, ~ 69:413-423, Songyang et al., 1994, Mol. Cell. Biol. 14:2777-2785), Songyang et al., 1993, Cell 72:767-778, and Koch et al., 1991, Science 252:668-678. Several intracellular substrate proteins that associate with RTKs have been identified. They may be divided into two principal groups: (1) substrates that have a catalytic domain, and (2) substrates which lack such domain but which serve as adapters and associate with catalytically active molecules. Songyang et al., 1993, ~ 72:767-778. The specificity of<br>
the interactions between receptors and SH2 domains of their substrates is determined by the amino acid residues immediately surrounding the phosphorylated tyrosine residue. Differences in the binding affinities between SH2 domains and the amino acid sequences surrounding the phosphotyrosine residues on particular receptors are consistent with the observed differences in their substrate phosphorylation profiles Songyang et al., 1993, ~ 72:767-778. These observations suggest that the function of each RTK is determined not only by its pattern of expression and ligand availability but also by the array of downstream signal transduction pathways that are activated by a particular receptor. Thus, phosphorylation provides an important regulatory step which determines the selectivity of signaling pathways recruited by specific growth factor receptors, as well as differentiation factor receptors.<br><br>
STKs, being primarily cytosolic, affect the internal biochemistry of the cell, often as a down-line response to a PTK event. STKs have been implicated in the signaling process which initiates DNA synthesis and subsequent mitosis leading to cell proliferation.<br><br>
Thus, PlC signal transduction results in, among other responses, cell proliferation, differentiation, growth and metabolism. Abnormal cell proliferation may result in a wide array of disorders and diseases, including the development of neoplasia such as carcinoma, sarcoma, glioblastoma and hemangioma, disorders such as leukemia, psoriasis, arteriosclerosis, arthritis and diabetic retinopathy and other disorders related to uncontrolled angiogenesis and/or vasculogenesis.<br><br>
A precise understanding of the mechanism by which the compounds of this invention inhibit PlCs is not required in order to practice tl~e present invention. However, while not<br>
hereby being bound to any particular mechanism or theory, it is believed that the compounds interact with the amino acids in the catalytic region of PKs. PKs typically possess a bilobate structure wherein ATP appears to bind in the cleft between the two lobes in a region where the amino acids are conserved among PKs. Inhibitors of PKs are believed to bind by non-covalent interactions such as hydrogen bonding, van der Waals forces and ionic interactions in the same general region where the aforesaid ATP binds to the P1(5. More specifically, it is thought that the 2-indolinone component of the compounds of this invention binds in the general space normally occupied by the adenine ring of ATP. Specificity of a particular molecule for a particular PlC may then arise as the result of additional interactions between the various substituents on the 2-indolinone core and the amino acid domains specific to particular PlCs. Thus, different indolinone substituents may contribute to preferential binding to particular P1(5. The ability to select compounds active at different ATP (or other nucleotide) binding sites makes the compounds of this invention useful for targeting any protein with such a site. The compounds disclosed herein may thus have utility as in vitro assays for such proteins as well as exhibiting j~ vivo therapeutic effects through interaction with such proteins.<br><br>
In another aspect, the protein kinase, the catalytic activity of which is modulated by contact with a compound of this invention, is a protein tyrosine kinase, more particularly, a receptor protein tyrosine kinase. Among the receptor protein tyrosine kinases whose catalytic activity can be modulated with a compound of this invention, or salt thereof, are, without limitation, EGF, HER2, HER3, HER4, IR, IGF-lR, IRR, PDGFRz, PDGFRP, CSFIR, C-Kit, C-fins, Flk-lR, Flk4, KDR/Flk-l, Flt-1, FGFR-1R, FGFR-2R, FGFR-3R and FGFR-4R.<br>
The protein tyrosine kinase whose catalytic activity is modulated by contact with a compound of this invention, or a salt or- a prodrug thereof, can also be a non-receptor or cellular protein tyrosine kinase (CTK). Thus, the catalytic activity of CTlCs such as, without limitation, Src, Frk, Btk, Csk, Abl, ZAP7O, Fes, Fps, Fak, Jak, Ack, Yes, Fyn, Lyn, Lck, Blk, Hck, Fgr and Yrk, may be modulated by contact with a compound or salt of this invention.<br><br>
Still another group of PlCs which may have their catalytic activity modulated by contact with a compound of this invention are the serine-threonine protein kinases such as, without limitation, CDK2 and Raf.<br><br>
In another aspect, this invention relates to a method for treating or preventing a PlC related disorder by administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of this invention, or a salt or a prodrug thereof, to an organism.<br><br>
It is also an aspect of this invention that a pharmaceutical composition containing a compound of this invention or a salt or prodrug thereof is administered to an organism for the purpose of preventing or treating a PlC related disorder.<br><br>
This invention is therefore directed to compounds that modulate PlC signal transduction by affecting the enzymatic activity of RTKs, CTKS and/or STKS, thereby interfering with the signals transduced by such proteins. More particularly, the present invention is directed to compounds which modulate RTK, CTK and/or STK mediated signal transduction pathways as a therapeutic approach to cure many kinds of solid tumors, including but not limited to carcinomas, sarcomas including Kaposi's sarcoma, erythroblastoma, glioblastoma, meningioma, astrocytoma, melanoma and myoblastoma. Treatment or prevention of non-solid tumor cancers such as leukemia are also contemplated by this invention. Indications may include, but<br>
are not limited to brain cancers, bladder cancers, ovarian cancers, gastric cancers, pancreas cancers, colon cancers, blood cancers, lung cancers and bone cancers.<br><br>
Further examples, without limitation, of the types of disorders related to inappropriate PlC activity that the compounds described herein may be useful in preventing., treating and studying, are cell proliferative disorders, fibrotic disorders and metabolic disorders.<br><br>
Cell proliferative disorders, which may be prevented, treated or further studied by the present invention include cancer, blood vessel proliferative disorders and mesangial cell proliferative disorders.<br><br>
Blood vessel proliferative disorders refer to disorders related to abnormal vasculogenesis (blood vessel formation) and angiogenesis (spreading of blood vessels). While vasculogenesis and angiogenesis play important roles in a variety of normal physiological processes such as embryonic development, corpus luteum formation, wound healing and organ regeneration, they also play a pivotal role in cancer development where they result in the formation of new capillaries needed to keep a tumor alive. Other examples of blood vessel proliferation disorders include arthritis, where new capillary blood vessels invade the joint and destroy cartilage, and ocular diseases, like diabetic retinopathy, where new capillaries in the retina invade the vitreous, bleed and cause blindness.<br><br>
Two structurally related RTlCs have been identified to bind VEGF with high affinity: the fins-like tyrosine 1 Cf it-l) receptor (Shibuya et al., 1990, OncoQene,5:519-524; De Vries et al., 1992., Science, 255:989-991) and the KDR/FLK-l receptor, also known as VEGF-R2. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been reported to be an endothelial cell specific mitogen with ~ ~ endothelial cell growth<br>
promoting activity. Ferrara &amp; Henzel, 1989, Biochein. BioDhys. Res. Comm., 161:851-858; Vaisman et al., 1990, J. Biol. Chem., 265:19461-19566. Information set forth in U.S. application Ser. Nos. 08/193,829, 08/038,596 and 07/975,750, strongly suggest that VEGF is not only responsible for endothelial cell proliferation, but also is the prime regulator of normal and pathological angiogenesis. See generally, lClagsburn &amp; Soker, 1993, Current BioloQv, 3(10)699-702; Houck, et al., 1992, ~<br><br>
~	267:26031-26037.<br><br>
Normal vasculogenesis and angiogenesis play important roles in a variety of physiological processes such as embryonic development, wound healing, organ regeneration and female reproductive processes such as follicle development in the corpus luteum during ovulation and placental growth after pregnancy. Folkinan &amp; Shing, 1992, J. Biolomical Chem., 267 (16) :10931-34. Uncontrolled vasculogenesis and/or angiogenesis has been associated with diseases such as diabetes as well as with malignant solid tumors that rely on vascularization for growth. lClagsburn &amp; Soker, 1993, Current Biology, 3(l0):699-702; Folkham, 1991, J. Natl. Cancer Inst., 82:4-6; Weidner, et al., 1991, New End. J. Med., 324:1-5.<br><br>
The surmised role of VEGF in endothelial cell proliferation and migration during angiogenesis and vasculogenesis indicates an important role for the KDR/PLK-l receptor in these processes. Diseases such as diabetes mellitus (Folkman, 198, in XIth Condress of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (Verstraeta, et al., eds.), pp. 583-596, Leuven University Press, Leuven) and arthritis, as well as malignant tumor growth may result from uncontrolled angiogenesis. See e.g., Folkman, 1971., N. Endl. J. Med., 285:1182-1186. The receptors to which VEGF specifically binds are an important and powerful therapeutic target for the regulation and modulation of vasculogenesis and/or angiogenesis and a variety<br>
of severe diseases which involve abnormal cellular growth caused by such processes. Plowman, et al., 1994, DN&amp;P, 7(6) :3~34-339. More particularly, the lCDR/FLK-l receptor's highJ.y specific role in neovascularization make it a choice target for therapeutic approaches to the treatment of cancer and other diseases which involve the uncontrolled formation of blood vessels.<br><br>
Thus, one aspect of the present invention relates to compounds capable of regulating and/or modulating tyrosine kinase signal transduction including KDR/FLlC-1 receptor signal transduction in order to inhibit or promote angiogenesis and/or vasculogenesis, that is, compounds that inhibit, prevent, or interfere with the signal transduced by KDR/FLK-l when activated by ligands such as VEGF. Although it is believed that the compounds of the present invention act on a receptor or other component along the tyrosine kinase signal transduction pathway, they may also act directly on the tumor cells that result from uncontrolled angiogenesis.<br><br>
Although the nomenclature of the human and murine counterparts of the generic "f 1k-I" receptor differ, they are, in many respects, interchangeable. The murine receptor, Flk-1, and its human counterpart, KDR, share a sequence homology of 93.4% within the intracellular domain. Likewise, murine FLK-I binds human VEGF with the same affinity as mouse VEGF, and accordingly, is activated by the ligand derived from either species. Millauer et al., 1993, ~ 72:835-846; Quinn et al., 1993, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 90:7533-7537. FLlC-l also associates with and subsequently tyrosine phosphorylates human RTK substrates (e.g., PLC-y or p85) when co-expressed in 293 cells (human embryonal kidney fibroblasts)<br><br>
Models which rely upon the FLK-l receptor therefore are directly applicable to understanding the KDR receptor. For example, use of the inurine FLK-1 receptor in methods which<br>
identify compounds that regulate the murine signal transduction pathway are directly applicable to the identification of compounds which may be used to regulate the human signal transduction pathway, that is, which regulate activity related to the I~R receptor. Thus, chemical compounds identified as inhibitors of KDR/FLlC-1 in ~ can be confirmed in suitable jfl vivo models. Both in xixQ mouse and rat animal models have been demonstrated to be of excellent value for the examination of the clinical potential of agents acting on the KDR/FLK-1 induced signal transduction pathway.<br><br>
Thus, in one aspect, this invention is directed to compounds that regulate, modulate and/or inhibit vasculogenesis and/or angiogenesis by affecting the enzymatic activity of the KDR/FLK-1 receptor and interfering with the signal transduced by KDR/FLK-1. In another aspect, the present invention is directed to compounds which regulate, modulate and/or inhibit the KDR/FLK-1 mediated signal transduction pathway as a therapeutic approach to the treatment of many kinds of solid tumors including, but not limited to, glioblastoma, melanoma and Kaposi's sarcoma, and ovarian, lung, mammary, prostate, pancreatic, colon and epidermoid carcinoma. In addition, data suggest the administration of compounds which inhibit the KDR/Flk-1 mediated signal transduction pathway may also be used in the treatment of hemangio~na, restenois and diabetic retinopathy.<br><br>
A further aspect of this invention relates to the inhibition of vasculogenesis and angiogenesis by other receptor-mediated pathways, including the pathway comprising the flt-l receptor.<br><br>
Receptor tyrosine kinase mediated signal transduction is initiated by extracellular interaction with a specific growth factor (ligand), followed by receptor dimerization, transient stimulation of the intrinsic protein tyrosine kinase activity<br>
and autophosphorylation. Binding sites are thereby created for intracellular signal transduction molecules which leads to the form&amp;t-ion of complexes with a spectrum of cytoplasmic signalling molecules that facilitate the appropriate cellular response, e.g., cell division and metabolic effects to the extracellular microenvironment. See, Schlessinger and Ullrich, 1992, Neuron, 9:1-20.<br><br>
The close homology of the intracellular regions of KDR/FLK-l with that of the PDGF-13 receptor (50.3% homology) and/or the related flt-l receptor indicates the induction of overlapping signal transduction pathways. For example, for the PDGF-f3 receptor, members of the src family (Twamley et al., 1993., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 90:7696-7700), phosphatidylinositol-3'-kinase (Hu et al., 1992, Mol. Cell. jj~., 12:981-990), phospholipase cy (Kashishian &amp; Cooper, 1993, Mol. Cell. Bid., 4:49-51), ras-GTPase-activating protein, (Kashishian et al., 1992, EMBO J., 11:1373-1382), PTP-ID/syp (lCazlauskas et al., 1993, Proc. Natl. Aced. Sci.<br><br>
J,1~AI 10 90:6939-6943), Grb2 (Arvidsson et al., 1994, ~.L Cell. Biol., 14:6715-6726), and the adapter molecules Shc and Nck (Nishimura et al., 1993, Md. Cell. Biol.., 13:6889-6896), have been shown to bind to regions involving different autophosphorylation sites. See generally, Cleesson-Weish, 1994, Proc. Growth Factor Res., 5:37-54. Thus, it is likely that signal transduction pathways activated by KDR/FLK-l include the ras pathway (Rozakis et al., 1992, Nature., 360:689-692), the PI-3'-kinase., the src-mediated and the plcymediated pathways. Each of these pathways may play a critical role in the angiogenic and/or vasculogenic effect of 1~R./FLK-l in endothelial cells. Consequently, a still further aspect of this invention relates to the use of the organic compounds described herein to modulate angiogenesis and vasculogenesis<br>
as such processes are controlled by these pathways. Conversely, disorders related to the shrinkage,<br><br>
contraiction or closing of blood vessels, such as restenosis, are also implicated and may be treated or prevented by the methods of this invention.<br><br>
Fibrotic disorders refer to the abnormal formation of extracellular matrices. Examples of fibrotic disorders include hepatic cirrhosis and mesangial cell proliferative disorders. Hepatic cirrhosis is characterized by the increase in extracellular matrix constituents resulting in the formation of a hepatic scar. An increased extracellular matrix resulting in a hepatic scar can also be caused by a viral infection such as hepatitis. Lipocytes appear to play a major role in hepatic cirrhosis. Other fibrotic disorders implicated include atherosclerosis.<br><br>
Mesangial cell proliferative disorders refer to disorders brought about by abnormal proliferation of mesangial cells. Mesangial proliferative disorders include various human renal diseases such as glomerulonephritis, diabetic nephropathy and malignant nephrosclerosis as well as such disorders as thrombotic microangiopathy syndromes, transplant rejection, and gloinerulopathies. The RTK PDGFR has been implicated in the maintenance of mesangial cell proliferation. Floege et al., 1993, Kidney International .~j:47S-54S.<br><br>
Many cancers are cell proliferative disorders and, as noted previously, PlCs have been associated with cell proliferative disorders. Thus, it is not surprising that PKs such as, for example, members of the RTK family have been associated with the development of cancer. Some of these receptors, like EGFR (Tuzi et al., 1991, Br. J. Cancer 63:227-233, Torp et al., 1992, ~ 100:713-719) HER2/neu (Slamon et al., 1989, Science 244:707-712) and PDGF-R (Kumabe et al., 1992, ~ 7:627-633) are over-expressed in many tumors<br>
and/or persistently activated by autocrine loops. In fact, in the most common and severe cancers these receptor overexpresaions (Akbasak and Suner-Akbasak et al., 1992, ~ Neurol. Sci., 111:119-133, Dickson et al., 1992, Cancer Treatment Res. 61:249-273, lCorc et al., 1992, J. Clin. Invest. 90:1352-1360) and autocrine loops (Lee and Donoghue, 1992, ~<br><br>
~ 118:1057-1070, lCorc et al., ~ Akbasak and Suner-Akbasak et al., supra) have been demonstrated. For example, EGFR has been associated with squamous cell carcinoma, astrocytoma, glioblastoma, head and neck cancer, lung cancer and bladder cancer. HER2 has been associated with breast, ovarian, gastric, lung, pancreas and bladder cancer. PDGFR has been associated with glioblastoma and melanoma as well as lung, ovarian and prostate cancer. The RTI( c-met has also been associated with malignant tumor formation. For example, c-met has been associated with, among other cancers, colorectal, thyroid, pancreatic, gastric and hepatocellular carcinomas and lymphomas. Additionally c-met has been linked to leukemia. Over-expression of the c-met gene has also been detected in patients with Hodgkins disease and Burkitts disease.<br><br>
IGF-IR, in addition to being implicated in nutritional support and in type-Il diabetes, has also been associated with several types of cancers. For example, IGF-I has been implicated as an autocrine growth stimulator for several tumor types, e.g. human breast cancer carcinoma cells (Arteaga et al., 1989, J. Clin. Invest. 84:1418-1423) and small lung tumor cells (Macauley et al., 1990, Cancer Res., 50:2511-2517) . In addition, IGF-I, while integrally involved in the normal growth and differentiation of the nervous system, also appears to be an autocrine stimulator of human gliomas. SandbergNordqvist et al., 1993, j~. 53:2475-2478. The importance of IGF-IR and its ligands in cell proliferation is<br>
further supported by the fact that many cell types in culture (fibroblasts, epithelial cells, smooth muscle cells, Tlymphocytes, myeloid cells, chondrocytes and osteoblasts (the stem cells of the bone marrow)) are stimulated to grow by IGF<br><br>
I.	Goldring and Goldring, 1991, Eukarvotic Gene Exrression,1:301-326. In a series of recent publications, Baserga suggests that IGF-IR plays a central role in the mechanism of transformation and, as such, could be a preferred target for therapeutic interventions for a broad spectrum of human malignancies. Baserga, 1995, Cancer Res., 55:249-252, Baserga, 1994, ~JJ~ 79:927-930, Coppola et al., 1994, M~.L. Cell. Biol., 14:4588-4595.<br><br>
STKs have been implicated in many types of cancer including, notably, breast cancer (Cance, et al., ~ Cancer, 54:571-77 (1993)).<br><br>
The association between abnormal PlC activity and disease is not restricted to cancer. For example, RTKs have been associated with diseases such as psoriasis, diabetes mellitus, endometriosis, angiogenesis, atheromatous plaque development, Alzheimer's disease, von Hippel-Lindau disease, epidermal hyperproliferation, neurodegenerative diseases, age-related rnacular degeneration and hemangiomas. For example, EGFR has been indicated in corneal and dermal wound healing. Defects in Insulin-R and IGF-1R are indicated in type-Il diabetes inellitus. A more complete correlation between specific RTKs and their therapeutic indications is set forth in Plowman et<br><br>
al., 1994, DN&amp;P 7:334-339.<br><br>
As noted previously, not only RTKs but CTKs including, but not limited to, src, abl, fps, yes, fyn, lyn, lck, blk, hck, fgr and yrk (reviewed by Bolen et al., 1992, FASEB J., 6:3403-3409) are involved in the proliferative and metabolic signal transduction pathway and thus could be expected, and have been shown, to be involve.d in mary PTK-mediated disorders to which the<br><br>
present invention is directed. For example, mutated src (v-src) has been shown to be an oncoprotein (pp5QVrc) in chicken. Moreover its cellular homolog, the proto-oncogene ppGo~src transmits oncogenic signals of many receptors. Over-expression of EGFR or HER2/neu in tumors leads to the constitutive activation of pp6O~rc, which is characteristic of malignant cells but absent in normal cells. On the other hand, mice deficient in the expression of c-src exhibit an osteopetrotic phenotype, indicating a key participation of c-src in osteoclast function and a possible involvement in related disorders.<br><br>
Similarly, Zap7O has been implicated in T-cell signaling which may relate to autoimmune disorders.<br><br>
STlCs have been associated with inflamation, autoimmune disease, immunoresponses, and hyperproliferation disorders such as restenosis, fibrosis, psoriasis, osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.<br><br>
PKs have also been implicated in embryo implantation. Thus, the compounds of this invention may provide an effective method of preventing such embryo implantation and thereby be useful as birth control agents.<br><br>
Finally, both RTKs and CTKs are currently suspected as being involved in hyperiinmune disorders.<br><br>
A method for identifying a chemical compound that modulates the catalytic activity of one or more of the above discussed protein kinases is another aspect of this invention. The method involves contacting cells expressing the desired protein kinase with a compound of this invention (or its salt or prodrug) and monitoring the cells for any effect that the compound has on them. The effect may be any observable, either to the naked eye or through the use of instrumentation, change or absence of change in a cell phenotype. The change or absence of change in the cell phenotype monitored may be, for example, without limitation, a change or absence of change<br><br>
in the catalytic activity of the protein kinase in the cells or a change or absence of change in the interaction of the proteiji kinase with a natural binding partner.<br><br>
Examples of the effect of a number of exemplary compounds of this invention on several PTlCs are shown in Tables 1 and 2 and in the Biological Examples section, below The compounds and data presented are not to be construed as limiting the scope of this invention in any manner whatsoever.<br><br>
5.	PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS AND USE<br><br>
A compound of the present invention, a prodrug thereof or a physiologically acceptable salt of either the compound or its prodrug, can be administered as such to a human patient or can be administered in pharmaceutical compositions in which the foregoing materials are mixed with suitable carriers or excipient(s). Techniques for formulation and administration of drugs may be found in "Remington's Pharmacological Sciences," Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA, latest edition. Routes of Administration.<br><br>
As used herein, "administer" or "administration" refers to the delivery of a compound, salt or prodrug of the present invention or of a pharmaceutical composition containing a compound, salt or prodrug of this invention to an organism for the purpose of prevention or treatment of a PlC-related disorder.<br><br>
Suitable routes of administration may include, without limitation, oral, rectal, transmucosal or intestinal administration or intramuscular, subcutaneous, intramedullary, intrathecal, direct intraventricular, intravenous, intravitreal, intraperitoneal, intranasal, or intraocular injections. The preferred routes of administration ary oral arid parenteral.<br><br>
Alternatively, one may administer the compound in a local rather than systemic manner, for example, via injection of the<br><br>
compound directly into a solid tumor, often in a depot or sustained release formulation.<br><br>
Furthermore, one may administer the drug in a targeted drug delivery system, for example, in a liposome coated with tumor-specific antibody. The liposomes will be targeted to and taken up selectively by the tumor. Composition/Formulation.<br><br>
Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be manufactured by processes well known in the art, e.g., by means of conventional mixing, dissolving, granulating, drageemaking, levigating, emulsifying, encapsulating, entrapping or lyophilizing processes.<br><br>
Pharmaceutical compositions for use in accordance with the present invention may be formulated in conventional manner using one or more physiologically acceptable carriers comprising excipients and auxiliaries which facilitate processing of the active compounds into preparations which can be used pharmaceutically. Proper formulation is dependent upon the route of administration chosen.<br><br>
For injection, the compounds of the invention may be formulated in aqueous solutions, preferably in physiologically compatible buffers such as Hanks' solution, Ringer's solution, or physiological saline buffer. For transmucosal administration, penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation. Such penetrants are generally known in the art.<br><br>
For oral administration, the compounds can be formulated by combining the active compounds with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers well known in the art. Such carriers enable the compounds of the invention to be formulated as tablets, pills, lozenges, dragees, capsules, liquids, gels, syrups, slurries, suspensions and the like, for oral ingestion by a patient. Pharmaceutical preparations for oral use can be<br><br>
made using a solid excipient, optionally grinding the resulting mixture, and processing the mixture of granules, after adding other suitable auxiliaries if desired, to obtain tablets or dragee cores. Useful excipients are, in particular, fillers such as sugars, including lactose, sucrose., mannitol, or sorbitol, cellulose preparations such as, for example, maize starch, wheat starch, rice starch and potato starch and other materials such as gelatin, gum tragacanth, methyl cellulose, hydroxypropylinethyl- cellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, and/or polyvinyl- pyrrolidone (PVP). If desired, disintegrating agents may be added, such as cross-linked polyvinyl pyrrolidone, agar, or alginic acid. A salt such as sodium alginate may also be used.<br><br>
Dragee cores are provided with suitable coatings. For this purpose, concentrated sugar solutions may be used which may optionally contain gum arabic, talc, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, carbopol gel, polyethylene glycol, and/or titanium dioxide, lacquer solutions, and suitable organic solvents or solvent mixtures. Dyestuffs or pigments may be added to the tablets or dragee coatings for identification or to characterize different combinations of active compound doses.<br><br>
Pharmaceutical compositions which can be used orally include push-fit capsules made of gelatin, as well as soft, sealed capsules made of gelatin and a plasticizer, such as glycerol or sorbitol. The push-fit capsules can contain the active ingredients in admixture with a filler such as lactose, a binder such as starch, and/or a lubricant such as talc or magnesium stearate and, optionally, stabilizers. In soft capsules, the active compounds may be dissolved or suspended in suitable liquids, such as fatty oils, liquid paraffin, or liquid polyethylene glycols. Stabilizers may be added in these formulations, also.<br><br>
For administration by inhalation, the compounds for use according to the present invention are conveniently delivered in the? form of an aerosol spray using a pressurized pack or a nebulizer and a suitable propellant, e.g., without limitation, dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetra- fluoroethane or carbon dioxide. In the case of a pressurized aerosol, the dosage unit may be controlled by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. Capsules and cartridges of, for example, gelatin for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated containing a powder mix of the compound and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch.<br><br>
The compounds may also be formulated for parenteral administration, e.g., by bolus injection or continuous infusion. Formulations for injection may be presented in unit dosage form, e.g., in ampoules or in multi-dose containers, with an added preservative. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulating materials such as suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents.<br><br>
Pharmaceutical compositions for parenteral administration include aqueous solutions of a water soluble form, such as, without limitation, a salt, of the active compound. Additionally, suspensions of the active compounds may be prepared in a lipophilic vehicle. Suitable lipophilic vehicles include fatty oils such as sesame oil, synthetic fatty acid esters such as ethyl oleate and triglycerides, or materials such as liposomes. Aqueous injection suspensions may contain substances which increase the viscosity of the suspension, such as sodium carbo2cyinethyl cellulose, sorbitol, or dextran. Optionally, the suspension may also contain suitable stabilizers and/or agents that increase the solubility of the compounds to allow for the preparation of highly concentrated solutions.<br><br>
Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form for constitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g., sterile, pyrogen--free water, before use.<br><br>
The compounds may also be formulated in rectal compositions such as suppositories or retention enemas, using, e.g., conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other glycerides.<br><br>
In addition to the foinulations described previously, the compounds may also be formulated as depot preparations. Such long acting formulations may be administered by implantation (for example, subcutaneously or intramuscularly) or by intramuscular injection. A compound of this invention may be formulated for this route of administration with suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials (for instance, in an emulsion with a pharaincologically acceptable oil), with ion exchange resins, or as a sparingly soluble derivative such as, without limitation, a sparingly soluble salt.<br><br>
A non-limiting example of a pharmaceutical carrier for the hydrophobic compounds of the invention is a cosolvent system comprising benzyl alcohol, a nonpolar surfactant, a water-miscible organic polymer and an aqueous phase such as the VPD co-solvent system. VPD is a solution of 3% w/v berizyl alcohol, 8% w/v of the nonpolar surf actant Polysorbate 80TM, and 65% w/v polyethylene glycol 300, made up to volume in absolute ethanol. The VPD co-solvent system (VPD:D5W) consists of VPD diluted 1:1 with a 5% dextrose in water solution. This co-solvent system dissolves hydrophobic compounds well, and itself produces low toxicity upon systemic administration. Naturally, the proportions of such a cosolvent system may be varied considerably without destroying its solubility and toxicity characteristics. Furthermore, the identity of the co-solvent components may be varied: for example, other low-toxicity nonpolar surfactants may be used<br>
instead of Polysorbate 8QTM, the fraction size of polyethylene glycol may be varied, other biocompatible polymers may replace polyethylene glycol, e.g., polyvinyl pyrrolidone., and other sugars or polysaccharides may substitute for dextrose.<br><br>
Alternatively, other delivery systems for hydrophobic pharmaceutical compounds may be employed. Liposomes and emulsions are well known examples of delivery vehicles or carriers for hydrophobic drugs. In addtion, certain organic solvents such as dimethylsulfoxide also may be employed, although often at the cost of greater toxicity.<br><br>
Additionally, the compounds may be delivered using a sustained-release system, such as semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the therapeutic agent. Various sustained-release materials have been established and are well known by those skilled in the art. Sustained-release capsules may, depending on their chemical nature, release the compounds for a few weeks up to over 100 days. Depending on the chemical nature and the biological stability of the therapeutic reagent, additional strategies for protein stabilization may be employed.<br><br>
The pharmaceutical compositions herein also may comprise suitable solid or gel phase carriers or excipients. Examples of such carriers or excipients include, but are not limited to, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, various sugars, starches, cellulose derivatives, gelatin, and polymers such as polyethylene glycols.<br><br>
Many of the PK modulating compounds of the invention may be provided as physiologically acceptable salts wherein the claimed compound may form the negatively or the positively charged species. Examples of salts in which the compound forms the positively charged moiety include, without limitation, quaternary ammonium (defined elsewhere herein), salts such as the hydrochloride, sulfate, carbonate, lactate,<br><br>
tartrate, maleate, succinate wherein the nitrogen atom of the quaternary aminonium group is a nitrogen of the selected compound of this invention which has reacted with the appropriate acid. Salts in which a compound of this invention forms the negatively charged species include, without limitation, the sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium salts formed by the reaction of a carboxylic acid group in the compound with an appropriate base (e.g. sodium hydroxide (NaOH), potassium hydroxide (KOR), Calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) etc.).<br><br>
Dosage.<br><br>
Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for use in the present invention include compositions wherein the active ingredients are contained in an amount sufficient to achieve the intended purpose, i.e., the modulation of PlC activity or the treatment or prevention of a PlC-related disorder.<br><br>
More specifically, a therapeutically effective amount means an amount of compound effective to prevent, alleviate or ameliorate symptoms of disease or prolong the survival of the subject being treated.<br><br>
Determination of a therapeutically effective amount is well within the capability of those skilled in the art, especially in light of the detailed disclosure provided herein.<br><br>
For any compound used in the methods of the invention, the therapeutically effective amount or dose can be estimated initially from cell culture assays. Then, the dosage can be formulated for use in animal models so as to achieve a circulating concentration range that includes the IC50 as determined in cell culture (i.e., the concentration of the test compound which achieves a half-maximal inhibition of the PlC activity). Such information can then be used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans.<br>
Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of the compounds described herein can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., by determining the IC50 and the LD~ (both of which are discussed elsewhere herein) for a subject compound. The data obtained from these cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in humans. The dosage may vary depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. The exact formulation, route of administration and dosage can be chosen by the individual physician in view of the patient's condition. (See e.g., Fingl, et al., 1975, in "The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics", Ch. 1 p.1).<br><br>
Dosage amount and interval may be adjusted individually to provide plasma levels of the active species which are sufficient to maintain the kinase modulating effects. These plasma levels are referred to as minimal effective concentrations (MECs). The MEC will vary for each compound but can be estimated from ~ yj.~ data, e.g., the concentration necessary to achieve 50-90% inhibition of a kinase may be ascertained using the assays described herein. Dosages necessary to achi~ve the MEC will depend on individual characteristics and route of administration. HPLC assays or bioassays can be used to determine plasma concentrations.<br><br>
Dosage intervals can also be determined using MEC value. Compounds should be administered using a regimen that maintains plasma levels above the MEC for 10-90% of the time, preferably between 30-90% and most preferably between 50-90%.<br><br>
In cases of local administration or selective uptake, the effective local concentration of the drug may not be related to plasma concentration and other procedures known in the art may be employed to determine the correct dosage amount and interval.<br>
The amount of a composition administered will, of course, be dependent on the subject being treated, the severity of the affliction, the manner of administration, the judgment of the prescribing physician, etc.<br><br><br>
The compositions may, if desired, be presented in a pack or dispenser device, such as an FDA approved kit, which may contain one or more unit dosage forms containing the active ingredient. The pack may for example comprise metal or plastic foil, such as a blister pack. The pack or dispenser device may be accompanied by instructions for administration. The pack or dispenser may also be accompanied by a notice associated with the container in a form prescribed by a governmental agency regulating the manufacture, use or sale of pharmaceuticals, which notice is reflective of approval by the agency of the form of the compositions or of human or veterinary administration. Such notice, for example, may be of the labeling approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for prescription drugs or of an approved product insert. Compositions comprising a compound of the invention formulated in a compatible pharmaceutical carrier may also be prepared, placed in an appropriate container, and labeled for treatment of an indicated condition. Suitable conditions indicated on the label may include treatment of a tumor, inhibition of angiogenesis, treatment of fibrosis, diabetes, and the like.<br><br>

7. BIOLOGICAL EVALUATION<br><br>
It will be appreciated that, in any given series of compounds, a spectrum of biological activity will be afforded. In its presently preferred embodiments, this invention relates to novel pyrrole substituted 2-indolinones demonstrating the ability to modulate RTK, CTK, and STlC activity. The following assays are employed to select those compounds demonstrating the optimal<br><br>
degree of the desired activity.<br><br>
A. Assay Procedures.<br><br>
The- following j11 vitro assays may be used to determine the level of activity and effect of the different compounds of the present invention on one or more of the PlCs. Similar assays can be designed along the same lines for any PlC using techniques Well known in the art.<br><br>
The cellular/catalytic assays described herein are performed in an ELISA format. The general procedure is as follows: a compound is introduced to cells expressing the test kinase, either naturally or recombinantly, for a selected period of time after which, if the test kinase is a receptor, a ligand known to activate the receptor is added. The cells are lysed and the lysate is transferred to the wells of an ELISA plate previously coated with a specific antibody recognizing the substrate of the enzymatic phosphorylation reaction. Non-substrate components of the'1 cell lysate are washed away and the amount of phosphorylation on the substrate is detected with an antibody specifically recognizing phosphotyrosine compared with control cells that were not contacted with a test compound. The cellular/biologic assays described herein measure the amount of DNA made in response to activation of a test kinase, which is a general measure of a proliferative response. The general procedure for this assay is as follows: a compound is introduced to cells expressing the test kinase, either naturally or recombinantly, for a selected period of time after which, if the test kinase is a receptor, a ligand known to activate the receptor is added. After incubation at least overnight, a DNA labeling reagent such as Bromodeoxyuridine CBrdU) or 3M-thymidine is added. The amount of labeled DNA is detected with either an antiBrdU antibody or by measuring radioactivity and is compared<br><br>
to control cells not contacted with a test compound. Cellular/Catalytic Assays<br><br>
Enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) may be used to detect and measure the presence of PlC activity. The ELISA may be conducted according to known protocols which are described in, for example, Voller, et al., 1980, "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay," In: Manual of Clinical Immunology, 2d ed.., edited by Rose and Friedman, pp 359-371 Am. Soc. Of Microbiology., Washington, D.C.<br><br>
The disclosed protocol may be adapted for determining activity with respect to a specific PlC. That is, the preferred protocols for conducting the ELISA experiments for specific PKs is provided below. However, adaptation of these protocols for determining a compound's activity for other members of the RTK family, as well as for CTKs and STlCs, is well within the scope of knowledge of those skilled in the art.<br><br>
FLX-1 Assay<br><br>
An ELISA assay is conducted to measure the kinase activity of the FLK-1 receptor and more specifically, the inhibition or activation of TK activity on the FLlC-i receptor. Specifically, the following assay can be conducted to measure kinase activity of the FLlC-1 receptor in cells genetically engineered to express Fik-l.<br><br>

DAY 0<br><br>
1.	Wash and trypsinize MtJV-EC-C cells (human umbilical vein endothelial cells, (American Type Culture Collection, catalogue no. 1730 CRL) . Wash with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline CD-PBS, obtained from Gibco BRL, catalogue no. 14190-029) 2 times at about I nil/lO cm2 of tissue culture flask. Trypsinize with 0.05% trypsin-EDTA in non-enzymatic cell dissociation solution (Sigma Chemical Company, catalogue no. C-1544) . The 0.05% trypsin is made by diluting 0.25% trypsin/1 mM EDTA (Gibco, catalogue no. 25200-049) in the cell dissociation solution. Trypsinize with about 1 ml/25-30 cm2 of tissue culture flask for about 5 minutes at 37W. After cells have detached from the flask, add an equal volume of assay medium and transfer to a 50 ml sterile centrifuge tube (Fisher Scientific, catalogue no. 05-539-6)<br><br>
2.	Wash the cells with about 35 ml assay medium in the<br><br>
50 ml sterile centrifuge tube by adding the assay medium, centrifuge for 10 minutes at approximately 200x g, aspirate the supernatant, and resuspend with 35 ml D-PBS. Repeat the wash two more times with D-PBS, resuspend the cells in about 1 ml assay medium/iS cm2 of tissue culture flask. Assay medium consists of Fl2K medium (Gibco BRL, catalogue no. 21127-014) and 0.5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Count the cells with a Coulter Counter® (Coulter Electronics, Inc.) and add assay medium to the cells to obtain a concentration of 0.8-1.0<br><br><br>
3.	Add cells to 96-well flat-bottom plates at 100 p1/well or 0.8-1.0 x l0~ cells/well, incubate —24h at 370C, 5% CO2.<br><br>
DAY 1<br><br>
1.	Make up two-fold test compound titrations in separate 96-well plates, generally 50 pM on down to 0 pM. Use<br><br>
the same assay medium as mentioned in day 0, step 2 above. Titrations are made by adding 90 p1/well of test compound at 200 pM (4X the final well concentration) to the top well of a particular plate column. Since the stock test compound is usually 20 mM in DM80, the 200 pM drug concentration contains 2% DM50.<br><br>
A diluent made up to 2% DMSO in assay medium CF12K + 0.5% fetal bovine serum) is used as diluent for the test compound titrations in order to dilute the test compound but keep the DMSO concentration constant. Add this diluent to the remaining wells in the column at 60 p1/well. Take 60 p1 from the 120 p1 of 200 pM test compound dilution in the top well of the column and mix with the 60 p1 in the second well of the column. Take 60 p1 from this well and mix with the 60 p1 in the third well of the column, and so on until two-fold titrations are completed. When the next-to-the-last well is mixed, take 60 p1 of the 120 p1 in this well and discard it. Leave the last well with 60 p1 of DMSO/media diluent as a non-test compound-containing control. Make 9 columns of titrated test compound, enough for triplicate wells each for: Cl) VEGF Cobtainedfrom Pepro Tech Inc., catalogue no. 100-200, (2) endothelial cell growth factor CECGF) (also known as acidic fibroblast growth factor, or aFGF) (obtained from Boehringer Manriheim Biochemica, catalogue no. 1439 600), or, (3) human PDGF B/B (1276-956, Boehringer Marinheim, Germany) and assay media control. ECGF comes as a preparation with sodium heparin.<br><br>
2.	Transfer 50 p1/well of the test compound dilutions to the 96-well assay plates containing the 0.8-1.0x104 cells/l0o p1/well of the HUV-EC-C cells from day 0 and incubate -2 h at 370 C, 5% CO2.<br><br><br>
3.	In triplicate, add 50 p1/well of 80 pg/nil VEGF, 20 ng/ml ECGF, or media control to each test compound condition. As wittr the test compounds, the growth factor concentrations are 4X the desired final concentration. Use the assay media from day 0 step 2 to make the concentrations of growth factors. Incubate approximately 24 hours at 370C, 5% CO2. Each well will have 50 p1 test compound dilution, 50 p1 growth factor or media, and 100 p1 cells, which calculates to 200 p1/well total. Thus the 4X concentrations of test compound and growth factors become lX once everything has been added to the wells.<br><br>
DAY 2<br><br>
1.	Add 3H-thymidine (Amersham, catalogue no. TRlC-686) at<br><br>
1 pCi/well (10 p1/well of 100 pCi/nil solution made up in RPMI<br><br>

In VIvo Animal Models<br><br>
Xeno~raft Animal Models<br><br>
The ability of human tumors to grow as xenografts in athymic mice (e.g., Balb/c, nu/nu) provides a useful j~ vivo model for studying the biological response to therapies for human tumors. Since the first successful xenotransplantation of human tumors into athymic mice, CRygaard and Povlsen, 1969, Acta Pathol. Microbial. Scand. 77:758-760), many different<br><br>
human tumor cell lines (e.g., mammary, lung, genitourinary, gastro-intestinal, head and neck, glioblastoma, bone, and malignant-melanomas) have been transplanted and successfully grown in nude mice. The following assays may be used to determine the level of activity, specificity and effect of the different compounds of the present invention. Three general types of assays are useful for evaluating compounds:<br><br>
cellular/catalytic, cellular/biological and in vivo. The object of the cellular/catalytic assays is to determine the effect of a compound on the ability of a TK to phosphorylate tyrosines on a known substrate in a cell. The object of the cellular/biological assays is to determine the effect of a compound on the biological response stimulated by a TK in a cell. The object of the in vivo assays is to determine the effect of a compound in an animal model of a particular disorder such as cancer.<br><br>
Suitable cell lines for subcutaneous xenograft experiments include C6 cells (glioma, ATCC # CCL 107), A375 cells (melanoma, ATCC # CRL 1619)., A431 cells Cepidermoid carcinoma, ATCC # CRL 1555), Calu 6 cells Clung, ATCC # HTB 56), PC3 cells (prostate, ATCC # CRL 1435), SKOV3TP5 cells and NIH 3T3 fibroblasts genetically engineered to overexpress EGFR, PDGFR, IGF-1R or any other test kinase. The following protocol can be used to perform xenograft experiments:<br><br>
Female athymic mice (BALE/c, nu/nu) are obtained from Simonsen Laboratories CGilroy, CA). All animals are maintained under clean-room conditions in Micro-isolator cages with Alpha-dri bedding. They receive sterile rodent chow and water ad libitum.<br><br>
Cell lines are grown in appropriate medium (for example, MEM, DMEM, Ham's FlO, or Ham's F12 plus 5% - 10% fetal bovine serum CFBS) and 2 mM glutamine (GLN)) . All cell culture media., glutamine, and fetal bovine serum are purchased from Gibco<br><br>
Life Technologies (Grand Island, NY) unless otherwise specified. All cells are grown in a humid atmosphere of 90-95% air-and 5-10% CO2 at 370C. All cell lines are routinely subcultured twice a week and are negative for mycoplasma as determined by the Mycotect method (Gibco).<br><br>
Cells are harvested at or near confluency with 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA and pelleted at 450 x g for 10 mm. Pellets are resuspended in sterile PBS or media Cwithout FBS) to a particular concentration and the cells are implanted into the hindflank of the mice (8 - 10 mice per group, 2 - 10 x 106 cells/animal). Tumor growth is measured over 3 to 6 weeks using venier calipers. Tumor volumes are calculated as a product of length x width x height unless otherwise indicated. P values are calculated using the Students t-test. Test compounds in 50 - 100 pL excipient CDMSO, or VPD:DSW) can be delivered by I? injection at different concentrations generally starting at day one after implantation.<br><br>
Tumor Invasion Model<br><br>
The following tumor invasion model has been developed and may be used for the evaluation of therapeutic value and efficacy of the compounds identified to selectively inhibit KDR/FLK-l - receptor.<br><br>
Procedure<br><br>
8 week old nude mice (female) (Simonsen Inc.) are used as experimental animals. Implantation of tumor cells can be performed in a laminar flow hood. For anesthesia, Xylazine/Ketamine Cocktail (100 mg/kg ketamine and 5 mg/kg Xylazine) are administered intraperitoneally. A midline incision is done to expose the abdominal cavity (approximately 1.5 cm in length) to inject 1Q~ tumor cells in a volume of 100 p1 medium. The cells are injected either into the duodenal lobe of the pancreas or under the serosa of the colon. The peritoneum and muscles are closed with a<br><br>
6-0	silk continuous suture and the skin is closed by using wound clips. Animals are observed daily.<br><br>
Analysis<br><br>
After 2-6 weeks, depending on gross obse±-vations of the animals, the mice are sacrificed, and the local tumor metastases to various organs (lung, liver, brain, stomach, spleen, heart, muscle) are excised and analyzed (measurement of tumor size, grade of invasion, immunochemistry, j~ situ hybridization determination, etc.)<br><br>
Measurement Of Cell Toxicity<br><br>
Therapeutic compounds should be more potent in inhibiting receptor tyrosine kinase activity than in exerting a cytotoxic effect. A measure of the effectiveness and cell toxicity of a compound can be obtained by determining the therapeutic index, i.e.., IC~0/LD50. IC50, the dose required to achieve 50% inhibition, can be measured using standard techniques such as those described herein. LD50 the dosage which results in 50% toxicity, can also be measured by standard techniques as wellCMossnian, 1983, ~. Immunol. Methods, 65:55-63), by measuring the amount of LDH released (Korzeniewski and Callewaert, 1983, J. Immunol. Methods, 64:313., Decker and Lohmann-Matthes, 1988, J. Immunol. Methods, 115:61), or by measuring the lethal dose in animal models. Compounds with a large therapeutic index are preferred. The therapeutic index should be greater than 2, preferably at least 10, more preferably at least 50.<br><br>
B.	Examples - Biological Activity.<br><br>
Examples of the j~ vitro potency of compounds of this invention are shown in Tables 1 and 2. The data show that the compounds are generally quite potent against a variety of PTKs in vitro. The compounds also maintain excellent activity when tested ~ y~. For example several compounds of the present invention, when administered orally, exhibit a marked reduced average size of C6 gliorna tumors subcutaneously<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
As shown in the following graph, all of the compounds tested show a marked inhibition compared to the vehicle-only control. However, compound S clearly and, considering the close structural similarity of the compounds tested, surprisingly stands out from the rest. That is, while compounds 3, 3.9 and 21 cluster around 40 - 45% inhibition of tumor growth at day 18 post-implantation, compound 5 inhibits tumor growth by 80 - 85% at that point.<br><br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
The unexpected efficacy of compound 5 in vivo, particularly upon oral administration, is further demonstrated when it is compared to compound 65:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Compound 65 manifests almost an order of magnitude greater potency j~ vitro than compound 5 (data not shown). However, when tested interpertitoneally in mice against two<br>
different tumor cells lines, 5F763T and SF767T, compound 5 is from slightly (5% greater inhibition at 21 days) to notably (3.4% greater inhibition at 21 days) more efficacious than compound 65.<br><br>
The difference in activity between compound 5 and compound 65 is even greater when the two compounds are administered orally. The oral efficacy of compound 65 and several of its analogs, compounds 66 - 69, is shown graphically below:<br><br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
As can be seen from the graph, compound 65,administered orally at 200 mg/kg/day, shows approximately 65% inhibition of CE tumors at 18 days post subcutaneous implantation in mice, which is clearly superior to its own analogs, which average about 14 - 16% inhibition of tumor growth. Surprisingly, however, the oral efficacy of compound 65 is still remarkably less than that of compound 5, which, as noted above, demonstrates 80-85% inhibition at the same time in the same tumor model.<br><br>
When compared to compound 70, compound 5 shows significantly smaller (i.e., greater potency) K~'s (inhibition constants) against FGF-R1 (1.2 for compound S versus 3.9.49 for compound 70)and PDGFR (data not shown).<br>
The unexpected superiority of compound 5 is further demonstrated when its oral efficacy is compared to that of a close analog, compound 71:<br><br><br><br>
Despite the structural similarity, when tested orally at 200 mg/kg/day against subcutaneously implanted CE human melanoma tumors in BALB/c nu/nu mice, at 18 days post implantation compound 73. shows only a 57% inhibition of tumor growth (data not shown) compared, again, to the 80-85% inhibition demonstrated by compound 5.<br><br>
Based on the above surprising efficacy of compound 5 when administered orally, compound 5 is presently a preferred embodiment of this invention.<br>
