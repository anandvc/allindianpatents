chemical resistance and mechanical characteristics, the polypropylene-based<br>
resin composition is widely used as materials for various products such as<br>
machine parts and automobile parts. Recently, the pursuit of the<br>
functionality and economic efficiency of the various products advances<br>
enlargement and reduction in wall thickness of the product. A<br>
polypropylene-based resin composition having excellent impact resistance,<br>
rigidity, and tensile elongation at break is demanded.<br>

Summary of the Invention<br>
Problems to be Solved by the Invention<br>
[0008]<br>
However, excellent impact resistance, tensile elongation at break and<br>
rigidity are further required for the polypropylene-based resin composition for<br>
reduction in wall thickness in order to particularly pursue economic efficiency<br>
and weight saving. However, impact resistance, tensile elongation at break<br>
and rigidity are in mutual contradiction. When any one of impact resistance,<br>
tensile elongation at break and rigidity is improved, the other characteristics<br>
are reduced. A technique of further enhancing the total balance of physical<br>
properties is desired.<br>
[0009]<br>
The present invention has been accomplished in view of the above-<br>
mentioned situation. It is a main object of the present invention to provide a<br>
polypropylene-based resin composition having excellent impact resistance,<br>
tensile elongation at break and rigidity, a molded article thereof, and an<br>
automobile interior or exterior material using the same.<br>

problems can be solved by a composition containing: 50 to 90% by mass of a<br>
polypropylene-based polymer (A); 5 to 50% by mass of an ethylene-α-olefin<br>

appropriately modifying it within the scope thereof.<br>
[0014]<br>

[0015]<br>

 <br>

polypropylene-based polymer (A) are not particularly limited. Known<br>
polypropylene-based polymers can be used. Examples of the<br>
polypropylene-based polymer (A) may include an isotactic highly crystalline<br>
polypropylene resin, and a syndiotactic or atactic polypropylene resin.<br>
Examples of the polypropylene resin may include a homopolymer of<br>
polypropylene, and a copolymer of propylene and other monomer.<br>
[0016]<br>
The copolymer of propylene and other monomer is not particularly<br>
limited. The copolymer may be a copolymer using known monomers.<br>
From the viewpoint of impact resistance, a copolymer of propylene and one<br>
or two or more α-olefins is preferable. From the viewpoint of high impact<br>
resistance and high rigidity, a random copolymer or a block copolymer of<br>
propylene and a C2 or C4-C20 α-olefin comonomer is more preferable. The<br>

structure and the branch position of an alkyl group is not specified, a branch<br>
is ordinarily present at a position where a carbon number of alkene is 3 or<br>
higher than 3.<br>
[0019]<br>
The molecular structure of the polypropylene-based polymer (A) is not<br>
particularly limited. Examples thereof may include a linear structure, a<br>
branch structure, and a graft structure due to a denaturant.<br>
[0020]<br>
The (A) component may be one polypropylene-based polymer, or may<br>
be a mixture of two or more polypropylene-based polymers. At this time, the<br>
dispersed form or the like is not limited. Examples thereof may include a<br>
form in which one polypropylene-based polymer is present as a continuous<br>
phase and other polypropylene-based polymer forms a disperse phase.<br>
Specific examples thereof may include a dispersed form in which a highly<br>
crystalline polypropylene resin forms a continuous phase and an ethylene-<br>
propylene copolymer forms a disperse phase when the (A) component is a<br>
mixture of the highly crystalline polypropylene resin and the ethylene-<br>
propylene copolymer. When the (A) component is a mixture of two or more<br>
polypropylene-based polymers, for example, separate solid-like pellets or the<br>
like may be used, which are obtained by polymerizing an isotactic highly<br>
crystalline polypropylene-based resin and an ethylene-propylene copolymer<br>
in separate processes.<br>
[0021]<br>
The melt flow rate (MFR; 230°C, JIS K7210) of the (A) component is<br>
not particularly limited. From the viewpoint of processability, the melt flow<br>
 <br>
rate thereof is preferably 1g/10 minutes or more, and more preferably 30 g/10<br>
minutes or more. From the viewpoint of rigidity, the melt flow rate is<br>
preferably 200 g/10 minutes or less, and more preferably 150 g/10 minutes or<br>
less.<br>
[0022]<br>
The content of the (A) component in the polypropylene-based resin<br>
composition of the present embodiment is 50% by mass or more from the<br>
viewpoint of rigidity. The content thereof is 90% by mass or less from the<br>

more preferably from 57 to 70% by mass.<br>
[0023]<br>
The preparing method of the polypropylene-based polymer (A) is not<br>
particularly limited. For example, the polypropylene-based polymer (A) can<br>
be prepared by known methods. For example, known catalysts such as a<br>
metallocene catalyst and a Ziegler-Natta catalyst may be used.<br>
[0024]<br>
Various processes such as one step or multi steps may be employed<br>
as the preparing method of the polypropylene-based polymer (A). The<br>
polypropylene-based polymer (A) may be prepared by polymerizing methods<br>
such as a slurry polymerizing method, a gas phase polymerizing method, a<br>
bulk polymerizing method, and a solution polymerizing method, or a<br>
combination thereof. In various processes such as one-step and multi-step,<br>
heterologous polymers may be polymerized and mixed. For example, after<br>
an isotactic highly crystalline polypropylene-based resin is polymerized in a<br>
 <br>
prior step, and an ethylene-propylene copolymer is polymerized in a<br>
subsequent step, these may be mixed.<br>
[0025]<br>

(B) component are not particularly limited. Known ethylene-α-olefin<br>
copolymer rubbers may be used.<br>
Examples of the (B) component may include a copolymer of ethylene<br>
and one or more C3-C20 α-olefins. A copolymer of ethylene and one or<br>
more C3-C10 α-olefin comonomers is preferable. A copolymer of ethylene<br>
and one or more C4-C8 α-olefin comonomers is more preferable. A<br>
copolymer of ethylene and one or more comonomers selected from the group<br>
consisting of propylene, 1-butene, 1-hexene, 4-methyl-1 -pentane, and 1-<br>
octene is still more preferable. A copolymer of ethylene and octene is yet<br>
still more preferable. The copolymer is preferable since the copolymer<br>
provides higher impact resistance and higher tensile elongation at break.<br>
[0026]<br>
The preparing method of the ethylene-α-olefin copolymer rubber (B) is<br>
not particularly limited. Catalysts (for example, catalysts or the like based<br>
on titanium, metallocene, or vanadium) can be used, which can easily<br>
provide an α-olefin copolymer having an increased molecular weight under a<br>
processing condition ordinarily performed. Of these, the metallocene<br>
catalyst and titanium chloride are preferable from the viewpoint of stability of<br>
structure control.<br>

(B) component. In this case, for example, two or more ethylene-α-olefin<br>
copolymer rubbers having different densities are preferably used from the<br>
viewpoint of further improving impact resistance, tensile elongation at break<br>
and rigidity. For example, two ethylene-α-olefin copolymer rubbers having<br>
densities of 0.857 g/cm3 and 0.870 g/cm3can be used in combination from<br>
the viewpoint of impact resistance, tensile elongation at break and rigidity.<br>
[0030]<br>
The peak temperature of tan5 obtained from the dynamic viscoelastic<br>
measurement of the (B) component is not particularly limited. The peak<br>
temperature thereof is preferably -60°C or more from the viewpoint of rigidity,<br>
and more preferably -50°C or more. The peak temperature is preferably -<br>
30°C or less from the viewpoint of impact resistance, and more preferably -<br>

measurement of the (B) component is preferably 0.2 or more from the<br>
viewpoint of obtaining high impact resistance, more preferably 0.25 or more,<br>

on an instrument "ARES" (manufactured by TA Instruments, trade name) in a<br>
torsion type geometry and carrying out the measurement under conditions of<br>
an effective measurement length of 25 mm, a strain of 0.5%, a frequency of 1<br>
Hz, and a temperature-raising rate of 3°C/min from -70°C to 50°C. The<br>

component is not particularly limited. The melt flow rate thereof is preferably<br>
0.1 g/10 minutes or more from the viewpoint of processability, and more<br>
preferably 0.3 g/10 minutes or more. The melt flow rate is preferably 50<br>
g/10 minutes or less from the viewpoint of mechanical characteristics, and<br>

In the present embodiment, in the nomenclature of each of the<br>
monomer units constituting a polymer, for example, the "vinyl aromatic<br>
monomer unit" means a repeating unit of a polymer produced as a result of<br>
polymerization of a vinyl aromatic compound which is a monomer. The<br>
structure is a molecular structure in which 2 carbons of a substituted ethylene<br>
group derived from a substituted vinyl group serve as a binding site. The<br>
"alkylene monomer unit" means a repeating unit of a polymer produced as a<br>
result of polymerization of alkylene which is a monomer, or a repeating unit<br>
 <br>
obtained by polymerizing a conjugated diene monomer unit and thereafter<br>
hydrogenating the conjugated diene monomer unit. When one unsaturated<br>
group of one conjugated diene monomer unit is hydrogenated, one ethylene<br>
monomer having two hydrogenated unsaturated groups is converted to two<br>
ethylene monomers.<br>
[0039]<br>
The conjugated diene monomer is a diolefin having a pair of<br>
conjugated double bonds. Examples thereof may include 1,3-butadiene, 2-<br>

of the present embodiment can be produced. The polypropylene-based<br>
 <br>
resin composition of the present embodiment can be prepared by known<br>
blending or mixing means. Suitable techniques can be appropriately<br>
selected. Components to be mixed are preferably blended with one another<br>
by a one-step process or a multi-step process. Furthermore, the<br>
polypropylene-based resin composition may be prepared by dry-blending<br>
respective components, and thereafter melt-mixing the components. The<br>
polypropylene-based resin composition may be directly prepared in an<br>
extruder for producing a molded article (for example, a completed product<br>
such as an automobile part). The components may be preliminarily mixed in<br>
a separate extruder (for example, a Banbury Mixer). The dry-blended<br>
material of the polypropylene-based resin composition of the present<br>
embodiment may be directly injection-molded without being preliminarily<br>
melt-mixed.<br>
[0090]<br>
A mixing apparatus is not particularly limited. Examples thereof<br>
include kneaders such as a Banbury mixer, a laboplast mill, a single-screw<br>
extruder, and a twin-screw extruder. Of these, a melt-mixing method using<br>
the extruder is preferable from the viewpoint of productivity and good<br>
kneading property. A part of components to be mixed may be blended in a<br>
different step in order to obtain more excellent performance.<br>
[0091]<br>
The polypropylene-based resin composition of the present<br>
embodiment can be molded by softening or melting the polypropylene-based<br>
resin composition by heating. For example, the polypropylene-based resin<br>
composition can be molded by using conventional molding techniques such<br>
as compression molding, injection molding, gas-assisted injection molding,<br>
hollow molding, sheet forming, rotational molding, laminating, calendering,<br>
 <br>
vacuum forming, thermoforming or hot forming, and extrusion. These<br>
molding techniques may be used singly or in combination of two or more.<br>
Of these, the injection molding is preferable from the viewpoint of productivity.<br>
[0092]<br>
The molded article containing the polypropylene-based resin<br>
composition of the present embodiment may be molded in any shape or form,<br>
and can be used as various members. For example, the molded article can<br>
be utilized for automobile exterior and interior members such as a bumper<br>
beam, a bumper board, a pillar, and a meter panel; a housing and a cover for<br>
an electrical component and an electrical instrument; other household use or<br>
individual products containing, for example, a home electric appliance, a<br>
household product, a freezer container, and a box; a garden furniture; and a<br>
sheet for building and for construction, or the like. Of these, the molded<br>
article can be preferably utilized as an automobile interior or exterior material<br>
from the viewpoint of strongly requiring impact resistance, tensile elongation<br>
at break and rigidity.<br>

(Production of Molded Body of Polypropylene-Based Resin Composition)<br>
The components having the percentages shown in Table 1 were<br>
kneaded under conditions of a temperature of 180°C, a rotation speed of 350<br>
rpm, and an output rate of 5 kg/h in a twin-screw extruder (L/D=42, 30 mm).<br>
The kneaded matter was molded at an injection-molding temperature of<br>
220°C and a die temperature of 40°C to produce a molded body made of a<br>
polypropylene-based resin composition.<br>
[0111]<br>
(Evaluating Method of Molded Body of Polypropylene Resin Composition)<br>
 <br>
Following measurements and evaluations were performed for<br>
characteristics of polypropylene-based resin compositions of Examples and<br>
Comparative Examples. The results are shown in Tables 1 and 2.<br>
(1)	Melt flow rate (MFR)<br>
This was evaluated according to ISO 1133: 1997.<br>
(Unit: g/10 minutes, 230°C, 2.16 kgf)<br>
(2)	Tensile elongation<br>
This was evaluated according to ASTM D 638-03.<br>
(3)	Flexural modulus<br>
This was evaluated according to ASTM D 790-03.<br>
(4)	Impact resistance (Charpy impact strength)<br>
This was evaluated according to ISO 179.<br>
(5)	Generating Length of Weld Mark<br>
When a plate having a length of 350 mm, a width of 135 mm, and a<br>
thickness of 3 mm was molded, a die was used, which had a gate provided at<br>
a position separated by 70 mm from a width surface on a side surface in a<br>
length direction. The die had a weir provided immediately below the gate in<br>
a flow direction (at a position separated by 50 mm from the gate). The weir<br>
had a length of 20 mm, a width of 20 mm, and a thickness of 3 mm and<br>
hindered the flow of a resin. When injection molding was performed by<br>
using the die, the generating length of a weld mark was obtained by<br>
measuring a length of the weld mark until the weld mark generated after the<br>
weir could not be visually distinguished. The case where the length was<br>
large was determined to be "x" (poor). The case where length was short<br>
was determined to be "o" (good).<br>
(6)	Observation of Phase Component<br>
 <br>
The obtained molded body was sliced and dyed with ruthenium. The<br>
molded body was then observed by a transmission electron microscope<br>
(manufactured by JEOL Ltd.). As a result, it was confirmed that the (A)<br>
component, the (B) component, the (C) component, and the (D) component<br>
were present as described below in the molded bodies of Examples 1 to 6,<br>
that the (A) component and the (B) component were each present as a<br>
continuous phase, and a disperse phase, and that the (C) component and<br>
the (D) component are dispersed on the interface between the (A)<br>
component and the (B) component. It was confirmed that 70% or more of<br>
the outer layer surface of the dispersed particles of the (B) component was<br>
covered with the (C) component or the (D) component.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
[0114]<br>
[Example 1 and Comparative Examples 1 and 2]<br>
As a result of evaluating the compositions in which the amount of the<br>
(C) component was changed, it was confirmed that each of at least the<br>
tensile elongation (between chucks), flexural modulus, and Charpy impact<br>
strength of Example 1 was excellent. On the other hand, it was confirmed<br>
that at least any one of the tensile elongation (between chucks), flexural<br>
modulus, and Charpy impact strength of each of the Comparative Examples<br>
1 and 2 was low.<br>
[0115]<br>
[Examples 2 to 6 and Comparative Examples 3 and 4]<br>
As shown in Table 2, it was confirmed that each of the tensile<br>
elongation (between chucks), flexural modulus, Charpy impact strength, and<br>
suppression of the weld line of each of the Examples was excellent. On the<br>
other hand, it was confirmed that at least any one of the tensile elongation<br>
(between chucks), flexural modulus, Charpy impact strength, and<br>
suppression of the weld line of each of the Comparative Examples was low.<br>
[0116]<br>
As described above, in the Examples, it was confirmed that the<br>
polypropylene-based resin composition according to the present invention<br>
was excellent in each of at least impact resistance, tensile elongation at<br>
break and rigidity.<br>
