This   invention   relates  to  a  machine  for     making  CM IU  UIOfJCMOHIlj   ICO.    I I IIO<br>
invention also relates to a machine for making and dispensing black tea (tea decoction) whenever black tea alone is required; and for dispensing milk, whenever milk alone is required. It is in this sense that the word "tea" should be understood in this specification wherever the context so requires.<br>
GeneraWy , the tea making machines known to the art are operated on e}ecthc power alone resulting in a situation where such machines are inoperative whenever there is power failure.<br>
Known tea making machines use a pre-mix of tea dust and whitener which does not produce tea of the real taste and flavour associated with this beverage.<br>
On the other hand, the machine proposed herein, while operating on electric power, automatically continues to operate, even after failure of electric power, on cooking gas.<br>
The whole procedure of making tea by the machine proposed herein is hygienic, since there is no stage, during the entire procedure adopted by the machine, of any of the ingredients used, or any of the internal components of the machine, coming into contact with any extraneous objects including the human body.<br><br>
The tea prepared by the proposed machine retains its natural good  taste, aroma<br>
and colour.<br>
The proposed machine works automatically, the part to be played manually consisting only of operation of command switches (appearing on the console in the form of press buttons) for carrying out specific operations eg for dispensing tea, black tea alone or milk alone.<br>
Predetermined quantities of tea, black tea or milk are dispensed by the machine, such perdetermined quanitities being fixed by corresponding predetermined time intervals. For instance, the proposed machine is made to dispense black tea for a specific number of seconds, which number is calculated to give a specific number of millilitres of black tea.<br>
The proposed machine is user friendly and is devised to operate even at the hands of the unskilled user, in tea shops, restaurants, business establishments, bus stands, railway stations and airport lounges to name a few of the places where the said machine can be installed and used.<br><br>
The proposed machine has self-replenishment facilities, so much so that once a cup is dispensed, the machine automatically compensates for the liquid dispensed by suitably operating, on its own, to replenish what was dispensed.<br>
Various other features and advantages of this invention will be apparent from the following further description thereof given hereunder.<br>
The machine for making and dispensing tea, according to this invention, comprises a microcontroller; a tea hopper for storing tea dust; means for feeding a predetermined quantity of tea dust, on activation by the microcontroller, from the hopper into a filter tray, disposed inside the said means; a shower disposed above the filter tray; a tea decoction storage vessel into which a predetermined quantity of water is drawn from a first source through first valve means, on activation by the microcontroller; second valve means for letting in steam, from a second source, into the said vessel, on activation by the microcontroller; a pump, when activated by the microcontroller, circulating the steam heated liquid from the vessel into the shower and thence onto the filter tray; a lid provided for the top of the vessel, below the filter tray, the lid having a drain hole opening into the vessel, whereby the decoction from the shower falls on to the filter tray and<br><br>
thence on to the lid, to be carried away therefrom, through the drain hole, into the vessel, the pump continuing to operate until the microcontroller de-activates it, after a predetermined interval of time, the heated decoction in the vessel being dispensed by the said pump through third valve means in a predetermined quantity, through a first faucet, on activation of the microcontroller, by manual operation of a first command switch; a third self-replenishing source from which a pre-determined quantity of pre-heated milk is dispensed through fourth valve means through a second faucet, on activation of the microcontroller by the manual operation of a second command switch, the milk being pre-heated by steam, let into the third source from the second source through fifth valve means, over a predetermined interval of time; the decoction as well as the milk being, dispensed separately through the first and second faucets, as aforesaid, on manual operation of a third command switch; the microcontroller thereafter replenishing the vessel with a predetermined quantity of tea dust from the hopper, a predetermined quantity of water from the first source, a predetermined quantity of steam from the second source, and circulating the decoction as aforesaid.<br>

In the said embodiment, the means for feeding a predetermined quantity of tea dust are exempted by a motor used screw feeder. The valve means are exemplifed by solenoid valves.<br>
The microcontroller 1 controls the activation of the components of the machine proposed herein.<br>
A tea hopper 2 is provided for storing tea dust. 3 is a motorised screw feeder controlled by the microcontroller 1. The feeder is mounted inside the tea hopper 2. This feeder, on activation by the microcontroller, feeds a metered quantity of tea dust from the hopper 2 into a filter tray 4 (provided with a filter mesh 5) disposed below the said feeder. Feeding of the tea dust from the hopper 2 into the filter tray 4 is done by the microcontroller 1 by turning on the screw feeder 3 for a predetermined interval of time.<br>
A shower 6 is disposed above the filter tray 4.<br><br>
A decoction storage vessel 7 is provided, into which a predetermined quantity of water is drawn form a first source, through a first solenoid valve 8 and through inlet 9 , on activation by the microcontroller 1. The predetermined quantity of water is drawn into the vessel 7 by the microcontroller 1 tuming on the solenoid valve 8 to open for a predetermined interval of time.<br>
A second solenoid valve 10 is intended for letting in steam, from a second source into the said vessel 7 on activation by the microcontroller 1. This is done by the microcontroller 1 tuming on the second solenoid valve 10 for a predetermined interval of time.<br>
A pump 11 when activated by the microcontroller 1 circulates the steam heated water in the said vessel 7 into the shower 6 and thence into the filter tray 4. Such activation is done by the microcontroller 1 for a predetermined interval of time.<br>
A lid 12 with a tapered surface at 13 is provided for the top of the said vessel 7 below the filter tray 4. The lid 12 has a drain hole 14 opening out into the said vessel 7, whereby the decoction from the shower 6 falls on to the filter tray 4 and thence on to the tapered surface 13 of the lid 12 and is carried therefrom through the drain hole 14 into the said vessel 7. The tapered surface 13 of the lid 12 enables the decoction falling on to the said surface to gravitate towards the drain hole 14 and    enter the vessel 7. The Pump 11 continues to operate until<br><br>
de-activated by the microcontroller on completion of the pre-determined interval of time, which interval is calculated to be sufficient for thoroughly mixing the tea dust with the steam-heated water in the vessel 7.<br>
Whenever the microcontroller 1 is manually actuated eg. by manually pressing a first command switch marked BLACK TE/(67)to dispense decoction from the vessel 7, a predetermined quantity of the decoction is dispensed by activation of the pump 11 through a third solenoid valve 15 and the first outlet faucet 16. This is done by the microcontroller 1 by activating the pump 11 and solenoid valve 15 for a predetermined interval of time. Simultaneously, the microcontroller activates the feeder 3 to discharge a metered quantity of the tea dust from the hopper 2 on to the filter tray 4. Thereafter, to compensate for the resulting loss of decoction, the microcontroller lets in a predetermined quantity of water into the vessel 7 through solenoid valve 8 and the inlet 9.The solenoid valve allows water to flow from the first source into the vessel 7 but not from the vessel 7 into the said source. This avoids possible entry of the decoction from the vessel 7 into the said source.<br>
Fresh steam is let into the vessel 7 through the solenoid valve 10, the pump 11 is activated to circulate the steam heated water in to the shower 6 and thence<br><br>
into the filter tray 4 . The decoction is carried therefrom through the drain hole 14 into the said vessel 7 and the procedure repeats as aforesaid over a predetermined interval of time to strengthen the decoction in the vessel 7.<br>
The vessel 7 is provided with a froth tube 17 with two apertures 18 and 19 enabling atmospheric air to be drawn into the tube at aperture 18 and mixed with the dispensed decoction at aperture 19, resulting in the dispensed decoction acquiring a froth which enhances the taste and flavour of the dispensed decoction. Furthermore, since the froth on the surface of the dispensed decoction acts as a heat insulating medium, the froth minimises loss of heat from the decoction, when exposed to atmospheric air.<br>
The aperture 18 is open to atmosphere while the aperture 19 is submerged in the decoction in the vessel 7.<br>
The term "microcontroller" in this specification means and includes relay logic, semiconductor logic or PLC (programme logic control).<br>
The first source from which water is drawn into the vessel 7 is exemplified by the self replenishing water dispenser. This has a container 20. The container 20 is<br><br>
closed on all sides except for an opening at its mouth 21. The container is positioned such that the mouth 21 points downwardly.<br>
A valve unit 22 has one end 23 attachable (for example, by a pin and slot joint) to the container 20. The valve unit 22 is provided with a reciprocably mounted spring-loaded valve member 24 the spring being indicated by 25.<br>
The mouth 21 of the container 20 is normally closed by the first end 26 of the said member 24 under spring force (force of the spring 25)<br>
A chamber 27 is attachable (for example by a pin and slot joint) to the valve unit22. Once attached the base 28 of the chamber 2 7 thrusts the second end 29 of the said member 24 against the spring force to cause the first end 26 of the member to open (uncover) the said mouth 21, and thus dispense the liquid from the container 20, into the chamber 27. From the chamber, the liquid is dischargeable, whenever required, through an outlet 30 in the chamber into the vessel 7.<br><br>
A collar 31 is provided for the valve unit22, forming an extention of the said mouth 21 and protruding into the chamber 27.<br>
The valve unit 22 has an air inlet for providing access for atmospheric air to the chamber 27. In the embodiment illustrated the air inlet consists of perforations 32 on a ridge 33 surrounding the valve unit.<br>
Thus, whenever the level of liquid dispensed into the chamber 27 reaches the rim<br>
34	of the collar 31 .entry of air from atmosphere into the container 20 ceases and<br>
the resulting air lock prevents further dispensation of the liquid into the chamber.<br>
Similarly , whenever the level of liquid in the chamber recedes to a level below the rim 34 of the collar 31, the entry of atmospheric air into the container 20 is resumed and the resulting removal of the air-lock, once again enables liquid from the container to be dispensed into the chamber 27, until the level of the liquid in the container reaches the rim 34 of the collar 31 to create an air lock.<br>
The liquid from the chamber 27 is discharged into the vessel 7 through the outlet<br>
35	and inlet 9 of the vessel 7. The liquid discharged into the vessel 7 will rise up<br><br>
to a level in line with the rim 34 of the collar 31 and then stop by reason of the air-lock. Whenever the liquid in the vessel 7 happens to be used, the fall in level of the liquid in the vessel 7 causes the level of the liquid in the chamber 27 to descend below the rim 34 of the collar 31; consequently, the air lock is removed and fresh liquid is dispensed from the container 20 into the chamber 27, until the level of the liquid in the chamber 27 reaches the rim 34 and creates an air-lock to stop further dispensation. Simultaneously, the liquid in the vessel 7 has reached a level in line with the rim 34 of the collar 31.<br>
In other words, the level of the liquid in the vessel 7 is maintained at a constant level, automatically by liquid dispensed from time to time.<br>
The container 20 can, of course, be replenished with liquid, by detaching the chamber 27 and valve unit 22 and reused again. As already stated above, water is drawn into the vessel 7 through a solenoid valve 8 and inlet 9. When water from the chamber 27 is to enter the vessel 7 the solenoid valve 8 opens and closes over a predetermined interval of time necessary to maintain the liquid in the vessel at a given level that is the level of the rim 34. Although this can be done without the aid of the solenoid valve 8, this valve is useful in preventing the decoction from entering the chamber 27.<br><br>
The second source for letting in steam into the vessel 7 is exemplified by the steam generator described below.<br>
A second vessel 36 is intended for receiving water. A second lid 37 securely covers the vessel 36 to prevent any escape of steam except through the steam outlet 38.<br>
An electric heating element 39 is disposed within the vessel 36. The element receives electric power from source.<br>
A pressure switch 40 is provided for disconnecting the element 39 from the power source, whenever the steam pressure reaches a predetermined limit and for reconnecting the said element to the said source whenever steam pressure falls the predetermined limit.<br>
A high pressure relief valve 41 is provided for opening and releasing steam whenever the steam exceeds a second predetermined limit, higher than the first predetermined limit. The valve 41 closes on the steam pressure reverting to the second predetermined limit.<br><br>
A fusible plug 42 is also provided for releasing steam whenever the temperature of the steam exceeds a predetermined value, due to malfunctioning of the pressure switch 40 and pressure relief valve 41. The fusible plug is a hoilow nut provided in the lid 37. The nut communicates with atmosphere and the interior of the vessel 36 but in actual use it is prevented from doing so by a fusible alloy which is packed in the hollow portion of the nut. Normally the said alloy prevents steam from the vessel exiting through the hollow in the nut; however, whenever the temperature of the steam in the vessel exceeds a predetermined temperature, the alloy melts and releases the steam in the vessel to atmosphere. This is an added safety feature of the steam generator proposed herein.<br>
A dosing pump 43 is provided for replenishing water in the vessel 36, the inlet of the dosing pump 43 being connected to a source of water and its outlet connected to the inlet 44 of the lid 37 of the vessel 36. The dosing pump 43 is activated by the microcontroller to replenish the vessel 36 with water, whenever steam is drawn from the vessel 36. The microcontroller activates the dosing pump to pump a calculated amount of water into the vessel 36 whenever steam is drawn from the vessel 36 over a given interval of time.<br>
The vessel 36 is surrounded by heat insulating means for minimizing dissipation of heat from the vessel.<br><br>
In the embodiment illustrated such means comprise two heat resistant sleeves 45 and 46 for surrounding the vessel, the space between the sleeves being packed with heat insulating material 47.<br>
As stated above steam from the steam outlet 38 enter the vessels 7 and 63, through a solenoid valves 10 and 66. The said solenoid valves will be kept open by the microcontroller over a predetermined interval of time enough to get the liquid inside the vessels 7 and 63 heated sufficiently.<br>
In the event of a failure of electric power supply to the steam generator, an automatic gas stove is provided to go into operation on failure of such power.<br>
The gas stove 50 is provided with a pipe line 51 which connects a source 52 of gas to the burner 53 of the stove 50.<br>
A normally closed valve, such as, a solenoid valve 54 is provided in the pipe line 51. The outlet at 55 of the source 52 is left open. The flow of gas through the pipe line 51 is thus stopped at the valve 54 unless the valve is activated by the microcontroller 1 to open and allow such flow to the burner 53.<br><br>
An ignitor 56 (either electrically or electronically operated) and a flame detector 57 are also provided for the burner 53.<br>
Assuming that electric power supply is on, the valve 54 is closed, the ignitor 56 is off. There is no gas flow to the burner 53.<br>
Assuming now that electric power is off, the microcontroller (which is powered by a battery 58) activates the ignitor 56 and after a small delay activates the valve 54 to open the gas from the source 52 to flow to the burner 53 through the pipeline 51. On the ignitor 56 being activated, the gas at the burner 53 gets ignited and begins to bum, to provide the necessary heat. The flame detector 57 detects the flame at the burner 53. The valve 54 continues to remain open the gas stove furnishes the requisite heat.<br>
Whenever electric power is resumed, the microcontroller 1 deactivates the valve 54 to close and the battery 58 gets charged.<br>
On the other hand if, when electric power is off, the ignitor 56 on and the gas flow on, the gas fails to ignite after a predetermined period of time, the "no flame"<br><br>
state indicated by the flame detector 57 causes the microcontroller to deactivate the valve 54. No gas now flows to the burner 53.<br>
Optionally , after another predetermined interval of time, by which interval remnant unburnt gas at the burner would have evacuated, the procedure repeats.<br>
Thus, the microcontroller 1 once again activates the ignitor 56 and after a small delay activates the valve 54 to open the gas flow to the burner 53. If the gas is not ignited after the aforementioned predetermined period of time, the same cycle repeats to a state where the valve 54 is deactivated.<br>
The optional procedure of attempting to ignite the gas can be repeated any desired number of times, although it if preferred to repeat the procedure twice.<br>
When the gas fails to ignite after the predetermined interval of time abovementioned after the first attempt or after the last of the optional repeat procedure, the micro controller 1 deactivates the valve 54 and energises an alarm informing the user that there is a system fault, to enable corrective action to be taken.<br><br>
The alarm can be audible or visible or a combination of both eg. a buzzer, a blinking light or both, together with a display message 70.<br>
The third source from which milk is dispensed is exemplified by the self replenishing milk dispenser which is similar in operation to the first source exemplified earlier.<br>
This source has a container 59, valve unit 60 provided with a reciprocably mounted spring-loaded valve member 61 a chamber 62 as in the case of the first source exemplified earlier. From the vessel 63 milk is dispensed through a fourth solenoid valve 64 on activation by the microcontroller 1, by the manual operation of a second command switch by pressing a button marked MILK 68. The solenoid valve is kept open by the microcontroller over a predetermined interval of time, so that a predetermined quantity of milk is dispensed from the vessel 63, that is to say, a cup of milk is dispensed through a second faucet 65. Simultaneously , the vessel 63 is replenished with fresh milk from the container 59.<br>
The milk in the vessel 63 is preheated (that is, heated before dispensing) by steam from the second source through a fifth solenoid valve 66 so that hot milk is dispensed from the faucet 65.<br><br>
The milk is heated by steam at predetermined points of time on activation of the microcontroller, to keep it hot.<br>
On operation of a third command switch, that is, a button marked TEA 69, hot decoction from the faucet 16 as well as hot milk from the faucet 65 are dispensed simultaneously in the manner described aforesaid to give tea. In such a case, the quantities of decoction and milk dispensed will be such that they are near about a cupful. On the other hand, when decoction alone is dispensed or milk alone is dispensed, the quantity dispensed in each case will be a little more so as to be near about a cupful.<br>
When stronger tea than normally dispensed is required, the third command switch, namely, the button marked TEA 69 is continuously pressed in order to get strong tea.<br>
The longer the button is pressed the stronger the tea is dispensed; however, this command will not be operative after a predetermined number of seconds, since there is a limit to the strength of the tea that can be dispensed.<br>
The operation is as follows:<br>
On the button marked TEA 69 being continuously pressed, a command from the microcontroller, causes the soleniod valve 15 to remain open longer than the<br><br>
predetermined time to dispense more decoction than normally dispensed; correspondingly the solenoid valve 64 which dispenses milk, is kept open for a correspondingly shorter time than normal to dispense less milk, so that the quantity of decoction and milk togather dispensed makes a cupful of tea of the desired strength.<br>
At periodic intervals, the machine is flushed with steam heated water, say at the end of every day of operation, to clean all parts which had come into contact with water, decoction, and milk, on the operation of a fourth command switch which activates the microcontroller. The flushed fluids are collected from the faucets 16 &amp;65.<br>
On the activation of the microcontroller by a fifth command switch BULK TEA 71 a specified number of cups of tea, milk or black tea can be dispensed, on after another, in cases where supply requirements are large.<br>
The terms and expressions herein are of description and not of limitation, there being no intention of such terms and expressions of excluding any equivalents of the features illustrated and described, but it is understood that various other embodiments of the machine proposed herein are possible without departing from the scope and ambit of this invention.<br><br><br>
