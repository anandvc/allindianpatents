				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention concerns a system for providing conditional access (i.e.,<br>
managing access) to a received scrambled audio/visual (A/V) signal from a variety of<br>
sources, such as broadcast television networks, cable television networks, digital satellite<br>
systems, and internet service providers. Utilizing the concept of secret sharing, the system<br>
does not require the full descrambling keys to be sent to the receiving device under<br>
encryption. The keys are recovered using at least one share received from the service<br>
provider and at least two shares stored in the device.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Today, a user may receive services from a variety of service providers, such as<br>
broadcast television networks, cable television networks, digital satellite systems, and internet<br>
service providers. Most television receivers are capable of receiving unscrambled information<br>
or programs directly from broadcast and cable networks. Cable networks providing<br>
scrambled programs usually require a separate stand alone set-top box to descramble the<br>
program. Similarly, digital satellite systems usually provide scrambled programs that also<br>
require the use of a separate set-top box. These set-top boxes may utilize a removable smart<br>
card which contain the keys necessary for recovering the descrambling keys. Protection of<br>
these important keys is paramount to prevent unauthorized copying of the program.<br>
Conditional access systems allow access to services (e.g., television, internet,<br>
etc.) based on payment and/or other requirements, such as authorization, identification and<br>
registration. In a conditional access system, a user (subscriber) enters into a service<br>
agreement with a service provider to obtain access rights.<br>
Figure 7 shows a conventional conditional access system architecture. The<br>
information or content (e.g., television program, movie, etc.) and the entitlement messages are<br>
protected (e.g., encrypted) before they are delivered to the subscriber. Presently, there are two<br>
(2) types of entitlement messages associated with each program or service. Entitlement<br>
control messages (ECMs) carry descrambling keys (sometimes referred to as 'control words')<br>
and a brief description of the program (e.g., program number, date, time, cost, etc.).<br>
Entitlement management messages (EMMs) specify the service-related authorization levels<br>
(e.g., indicating the type or service, the duration of the service, etc.). The EMMs can be<br>
distributed on the same channel as the service, or may be sent on a separate channel, such as a<br>
telephone line. The ECMs are typically multiplexed and sent with the associated program.<br>
Figure 8 shows a conventional transmitter side architecture for a conditional<br>
access system, such as the one shown in Figure 7. As will be understood, streams of audio,<br>
video and data from the service are multiplexed before they are scrambled, modulated and<br>
sent to the receiver (i.e., subscriber).<br>
Figure 9 shows a conventional receiver side architecture for a conditional<br>
access system, such as the one shown in Figure 7. As will be understood, the received bit<br>
stream is demodulated, decrypted and decompressed before separate audio, video and data<br>
streams are sent to the display device (e.g., television screen).<br>
Encryption-based technologies are widely used for protecting distributed<br>
content. If the subscriber is authorized to watch a particular protected program, the program<br>
is descrambled and sent to a display (e.g., television screen) for viewing. In most conditional<br>
access systems, the subscriber will have a digital device (e.g., set-top box, digital television,<br>
digital videocassette recorder) which includes a smart card for descrambling the program<br>
based on the EMMs and ECMs.<br>
Programs are typically scrambled using symmetric ciphers such as the Data<br>
Encryption Standard (DES). For security reasons, the scrambling key (and hence the ECM) is<br>
changed frequently, the period of change being on the order of a few seconds. Although the<br>
conditional access provider often privately defines the protection of the ECMs, public key<br>
cryptography is a viable tool for transporting keys from the service provider to the<br>
subscribers. The descrambling keys are encrypted with a public key on the transmitter side,<br>
and recovered by the corresponding private key (stored in the smart card of the receiver) on<br>
the receiver side.<br>
However, public key cryptography has significant drawbacks. For example,<br>
public key schemes are significantly slower than symmetric key schemes, and often have<br>
longer keys (i.e., keys with more alpha-numeric characters). Additionally, computationally<br>
demanding algorithms (such as RSA described above) are required in order to recover the key.<br>
Separating the security functionality from the navigational functionality (i.e.,<br>
channel surfing) in these digital devices is important. Separation allows device manufacturers<br>
to produce devices which operate independently of the specific conditional access systems.<br>
This is important for two reasons:<br>
(1) Until recently set-top boxes were not readily available at retail stores; they<br>
were manufactured for cable companies who delivered them directly to the subscriber. Major<br>
consumer electronics manufacturers and electronics retailers have objected to this practice as<br>
monopolistic.<br>
(2) From a security standpoint, if the keys are discovered ('hacked'), the<br>
conditional access provider needs only to replace the smart card in the affected devices (e.g.,<br>
set-top boxes), and not reconfigure the entire system.<br>
Thus, there is presently a need for a scheme for protecting information which<br>
utilizes a concept other than public key cryptography, such as threshold cryptography.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention defines a method and apparatus for managing access to a<br>
signal, representative of an event of a service provider, utilizing a smart card. That is, this<br>
method comprises receiving in a smart card a signal that is scrambled using a symmetric<br>
scrambling key, receiving data representative of a first share, constructing the scrambling key<br>
using the first share and at least two additional shares that are stored in the smart card and<br>
descrambling the signal using the constructed scrambling key to provide a descrambled signal.<br>
In accordance with a first exemplary embodiment of the present invention,<br>
first, second and third shares are used. The first, second and third shares are points on a<br>
Euclidean plane and the step of constructing the scrambling key comprises calculating the Y-<br>
intercept of the parabolic curve formed on the Euclidean plane by the first, second and third<br>
shares.<br>
In accordance with a second exemplary embodiment of the present invention,<br>
first, second, third and fourth shares are used. The first, second, third and fourth shares are<br>
points on a Euclidean plane and the step of constructing the scrambling key comprises<br>
calculating the Y-intercept of the curve formed on the Euclidean plane by the first, second,<br>
third and fourth shares. In general, any number of shares may be used, depending upon the<br>
level of security required.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
In a conditional access (CA) system, signals are usually scrambled using<br>
symmetric ciphers such as the Data Encryption Standard (DES). For security reasons, the<br>
scrambling key is changed frequently, the period of change being in the order of a few<br>
seconds. The protection of the descrambling keys (sent with the signals) is often provided by<br>
public-key cryptography, which as discussed above requires relatively significant<br>
computational power and memory. This invention resides, in part, in recognition of the<br>
described problem, and, in part, in providing a solution to the problem.<br>
A signal (e.g., an event or program) as described herein comprises information<br>
such as (1) audio/visual data (for example, a movie, weekly "television" show or a<br>
documentary); (2) textual data (for example, an electronic magazine, paper, or weather news);<br>
(3) computer software; (4) binary data (for example, images); (5) HTML data (for example,<br>
web pages); or any other information for which access control may be involved. The service<br>
providers include any provider broadcasting events, for example, traditional broadcast<br>
television networks, cable networks, digital satellite networks, providers of electronic list of<br>
events, such as electronic program guide providers, and in certain cases internet service<br>
providers.<br>
The present invention provides a method and apparatus for securely<br>
transporting the descrambling keys. The present invention has particular use in a conditional<br>
access system, in which programs or services may be obtained from one of a plurality of<br>
sources. The method when implemented within a device, such as a digital television, digital<br>
video cassette recorder or set-top box, provides convenient management of the descrambling<br>
keys because only a portion of the data necessary for key construction is stored therein. For<br>
simplicity, the below description of the invention will be directed towards an implementation<br>
using a digital television and a smart card.<br>
In Figure 1, system 30 depicts the general architecture for managing access to a<br>
digital television (DTV) 40. Smart Card (SC) 42 is inserted into, or coupled to, a smart card<br>
reader 43 of DTV 40 an internal bus 45 interconnects DTV 40 and SC 42 thereby permitting<br>
the transfer of data therebetween. Such smart cards include ISO 7816 cards having a card<br>
body with a plurality of terminal pins arranged on a surface in compliance with National<br>
Renewable Security Standard (NRSS) Part A or PCMCIA cards complying with NRSS Part<br>
B.<br>
DTV 40 has the ability to receive services from a plurality of service providers<br>
(SPs), such as a broadcast television SP 50, a cable television SP 52, a satellite system SP 54,<br>
and an internet SP 56. Conditional Access Organization (CA) 75 is not directly connected to<br>
either the service providers or DTV 40 but deals with key management and issues public and<br>
private key pairs which may be used, if necessary, as explained below.<br>
The present invention employs the concept of secret sharing which eliminates<br>
the requirement for using public key cryptography (or any other cipher system) to ensure<br>
secure transmission of the audio/visual (A/V) stream from a service provider (e.g., SP 50-56)<br>
to the smart card (e.g., SC 42) of the subscriber.<br>
The present invention employs an application of a secret sharing scheme,<br>
originally developed by Adi Shamir, known as a 'threshold scheme' or 'threshold<br>
cryptography' (See, A. Shamir, "How to share a secret," Communications of the ACM, Vol.<br>
22, No. 11, pp. 612-613, November 1979). An (t,n) threshold scheme, such as the one<br>
proposed by Shamir, involves breaking a secret into n pieces (which may be called 'shares' or<br>
'shadows') in such a way that at least t (
secret. A perfect threshold scheme is a threshold scheme in which knowledge of (t-1) or<br>
fewer pieces ('shares' or 'shadows') provides no information about the secret.<br>
For example, with a (3,4) threshold scheme, the secret is divided into four<br>
shares but only three of the shares are required to reconstruct the secret. Two of the shares,<br>
however, cannot reconstruct the secret. In Shamir's (t,n) threshold scheme, choosing a higher<br>
value for t, and storing (t-1) secrets in the smart card would increase the system's resistance to<br>
ciphertext only attacks, but would lead to more computations for polynomial construction.<br>
Such a threshold scheme reduces the computational requirements for the smart<br>
card in symmetric key recovery. For each new key, only a simple operation is performed (i.e.,<br>
the value of the polynomial at x = 0 is computed), as compared to RSA decryption which<br>
involves modular exponentiation. Additionally, security is perfect (i.e., given knowledge of<br>
(x1, y1), all values of the secret remain equally probable).<br>
The present invention utilizes the principles of Shamir's secret sharing to<br>
conceal the identity of a key for descrambling a scrambled signal in a conditional access<br>
system. In particular, the present inventor proposes a scheme where the scrambling key<br>
comprises the Y-intercept of a specific line or curve formed by two or more points in a<br>
Euclidean plane.<br>
In the simplest embodiment of this scheme, the receiver (e.g., smart card) is<br>
manufactured with a share or shares already stored therein (this is often referred to as a<br>
'prepositioned' shared secret scheme, as discussed below). This stored share is used to<br>
compute the key to scramble a signal at a transmitter. When the scrambled signal is<br>
transmitted, an additional or 'activating' share is transmitted therewith. It will be noted that<br>
the 'activating' share does not need to be encrypted in this scheme, since knowledge of the<br>
activating share means nothing without the knowledge of the stored share. On receiving the<br>
'activating' share, the receiver reconstructs the scrambled signal using a descrambling key<br>
which is computed by finding the Y-intercept of the line formed by the stored share and the<br>
'activatng' share. Each time a new key is required, a new 'activating' share may be selected<br>
at the transmitter, thereby changing the Y-intercept of the line formed by the stored share and<br>
the 'activating' share. In this way, an infinite number of scrambling keys may be defined and<br>
utilized without changing the smart card or the receiver hardware or software.<br>
The key generation and distribution process may be automated by developing a<br>
program to perform the following steps:<br>
(a) Choose a secret S; this will be a value along the Y-axis of a Euclidean<br>
plane<br>
(b) Construct a first-degree polynomial f(x) that passes through the point (0, S)<br>
and another point (x0, y0).<br>
© Compute f(x) at x1, where x1 cannot equal x0<br>
(d) Distribute (x1, y1) with the content protected with S<br>
Such a scheme as the one described above is often referred to as a<br>
'prepositioned' shared secret scheme because a portion of the secret is 'prepositioned' at the<br>
receiver. In the above example, the 'prepositioned' share is the share which is stored at the<br>
receiver in the smart card. Such 'prepositioned' shared secret schemes have been discussed<br>
by others in the field of cryptology.(See, G.J. Simmons, "How to (really) share a secret,"<br>
Advances in Cryptology - CRYPTO, '88 Proceedings, Springer-Verlag, pp. 390-448, 1990;<br>
G.J. Simmons, "Prepositioned shared secret and/or shared control schemes," Advances in<br>
Cryptology - EUROCRYPT '89 Proceedings, Springer-Verlag, pp. 436-467, 1990). By<br>
prepositioning a certain share or shares, the scrambling key can be changed relatively easily<br>
without changing any of the circuitry at the receiver; only the 'activating' share need to be<br>
changed.<br>
It will be noted that the above algorithm outlines a prepositioned secret sharing<br>
scheme which utilizes a secret S with only 2 shares (i.e., 2 points of a line on a Euclidean<br>
plane). Of course, other more complex secrets S can be developed which have many more<br>
shares (points). The important aspect of a prepositioned secret sharing scheme is that some of<br>
the shares are 'prepositioned' at the receiver.<br>
The present invention involves storing at least one of the shares of a secret at a<br>
specific location (e.g., in a smart card memory). The stored share is then used in conjunction<br>
with an 'activating' share to construct the secret. In a (4,4) scheme, for example, preferably<br>
three (3) of the four (4) shares are stored at the specific location (e.g., smart card). Then, the<br>
last share (also referred to herein as the 'activating' share) is transmitted to the location to<br>
obtain the secret. It is important to note that with the present invention, the secret is not the<br>
shares themselves but the Y-intercept of the line or curve (for higher order polynomials)<br>
formed by the shares when expressed as points on a Euclidean plane.<br>
Figures 2 and 3 together, demonstrate a first exemplary embodiment of the<br>
present invention. In the first exemplary embodiment, a secret with two shares is used. As<br>
noted above, each share is defined by a point on a Euclidean plane. Particularly, stored in SC<br>
42 is a first share (or data point). The first share may be thought of as a single point on a<br>
Euclidean plane (i.e., in the form of (x0, y0))- Service provider 58. transmits a signal (or event<br>
or program) that may be scrambled by a symmetric key, for example a Data Encryption<br>
Standard (DES) key. In addition to the scrambled signal, service provider 58 transmits a<br>
second (or 'activating') share. Similarly, the second share may be a second single point from<br>
the same Euclidean plane (i.e., in the form of (x1, y1)).<br>
The scrambled A/V signal and the second ('activating') share are received by<br>
DTV 40 and are sent to SC 42 for processing. SC 42 receives the second ('activating') share<br>
and utilizes both the stored first share and the received second share to reconstruct (or<br>
recover) the symmetric key. SC 42 then uses the reconstructed symmetric key to descramble<br>
the received scrambled A/V signal and generate a descrambled A/V signal. This descrambled<br>
A/V signal is provided to DTV 40 for display.<br>
Recovery of the symmetric key is achieved by constructing a polynomial<br>
utilizing the first and the second shares; the y-intercept of the constructed polynomial being<br>
the symmetric key. For example, given (x0, y0) and (x1, y1), the symmetric key is constructed<br>
by computing the value of S in the given finite field, where:<br><br>
Figure 3a illustrates a graphical representation of the first exemplary<br>
embodiment of the present invention showing exemplary shares (x0, y0) and (x1, y1, and a line<br>
formed thereby which crosses the Y-axis at a specific point (which is the key). For<br>
demonstrative purposes the plot in Figure 3a is obtained using real numbers, and not modular<br>
arithmetic.<br>
Such an approach as the one described above with reference to the first<br>
exemplary embodiment permits more than one service provider to share the stored second<br>
share (x0, y0) (i.e., 'activating' share). Each service provider would then be free to choose its<br>
own first share (i.e., (x1, y1)). The probability of constructing polynomials with identical y-<br>
intercepts (i.e., identical symmetric keys) is low. However, the range of possible second<br>
shares could be allocated such that each service provider has a unique and non-overlapping<br>
range, (see Figure 3b). Further, it is within the scope of the present invention that each service<br>
provider could choose its own first share which could be encrypted using the public key of the<br>
smart card before downloading. The share would be recovered by the smart card using its<br>
private key Kscpri. Additionally, as explained below, scrambling portions of the event with<br>
different keys and transmitting different second shares may increase the robustness of the<br>
defined system.<br>
To consider an example in accordance with the first exemplary embodiment of<br>
the present invention, assume points (x0, y0)= (17,15) and (x1, y1) = (5, 10) and p=23. The<br>
first-degree polynomial:<br><br>
passing through (x0, y0) and (x1, y1) can be constructed by solving:<br><br>
The solution (a1, a0) = (10,6) gives the polynomial:<br><br>
The value of the secret S can be discovered by computing f(0):<br><br>
Thus, according to the above example the value of the secret, and thus the<br>
scrambling key, would be 6 (mod 23). Of course the value of this secret will change with<br>
each different value of (x1, y1).<br>
Figure 4 illustrates a key recovery scheme according to a second exemplary<br>
embodiment of the present invention that utilizes three shares for (as opposed to the two<br>
shares of the first exemplary embodiment). In the second exemplary embodiment, recovery of<br>
the symmetric key is achieved by constructing a second-degree polynomial (i.e., parabolic<br>
curve) utilizing first, second and third shares (e.g., (x0,y0), (x1,y1), (x2,y2)); the y-intercept of<br>
the constructed second-degree polynomial being the symmetric key.<br>
To consider an example in accordance with the second exemplary embodiment<br>
of the present invention, assume points (x0, y0) = (17, 15), (x1, y1) = (5, 10), and (x2, y2) = (12,<br>
6), and p=23. The second-degree polynomial:<br><br>
passing through (x0,y0), (x1,y1), and (x2, y2) can be constructed by solving:<br><br>
The solution (a2, a1, a0) = (10, 20, 5) gives the polynomial:<br><br>
The value of the secret S can be discovered by computing f(0):<br><br>
As shown in Figure 4, the first, second and third shares may be expressed as<br>
points on a Euclidean plane. For demonstrative purposes the plot in Figure 4 is obtained using<br>
real numbers, and not modular arithmetic.<br>
Figure 5 illustrates a key recovery scheme according to a third exemplary<br>
embodiment of the present invention that utilizes four shares. In the third exemplary<br>
embodiment, recovery of the symmetric key is achieved by constructing a third-degree<br>
polynomial (i.e., curve) utilizing first, second, third and fourth shares (e.g., (x0,y0), (x1,y1),<br>
(x2,y2), (x3,y3)); the y-intercept of the constructed third-degree polynomial being the<br>
symmetric key.<br>
To consider an example in accordance with the third exemplary embodiment of<br>
the present invention, assume points (xo, yo) = (17, 15), (x1, y1) = (5, 10), (x2, y2) = (12,6) and<br>
(x3, y3) = (3, 12) and p=23. The third-degree polynomial<br><br>
passing through (x0, y0), (x1, y1), (x2, y2) and (x3, y3) can be constructed by solving:<br><br>
The solution (a3, a2, a1, a0) = (18, 19, 0, 22) gives the polynomial:<br><br>
The value of the secret S can be discovered by computing f(0):<br><br>
As shown in Figure 5, the first, second, third and fourth shares may be<br>
expressed as points on a Euclidean plane. For demonstrative purposes the plot in Figure 5 is<br>
obtained using real numbers, and not modular arithmetic.<br>
Multiple shares as described above can also be used to build a convenient key<br>
management scheme for a conditional access system. Conditional access system operators<br>
often define three levels of keys: (1) individual, (2) group, and (3) regional. Subscribers of<br>
the conditional access system may be assigned one or more of these different authorization<br>
levels by storing different numbers of shares in their respective smart cards.<br>
Consider a conditional access system in which a specified population of smart<br>
cards is used for controlling access to the system. Three different card types may be<br>
manufactured:<br>
(1) Level 1 Smart Card - all the smart cards in the broadcast 'region' are<br>
assigned one common share (i.e., a share common to all smart cards in the region);<br>
(2) Level 2 Smart Card - all the smart cards in a specified group are assigned<br>
an additional common share (i.e., another share common to all smart cards in the specified<br>
group); and<br>
(3) Level 3 Smart Card - each smart card is assigned a unique additional<br>
share.<br>
The above-described smart cards may be used in conjunction with an<br>
'activating' share to descramble certain programs. Since the Level 1 smart card includes only<br>
one share, while the Level 2 smart card includes 2 shares, and the Level 3 smart card includes<br>
3 shares, each card will provide different sets of descrambling keys. Thus, all smart cards in<br>
the broadcast region (i.e., Level 1 smart cards) will have the ability to receive and descramble<br>
the general broadcast (e.g., basic television channels), but only Level 2 Smart Cards will have<br>
the ability to receive and descramble some additional programs (e.g., HBO, Showtime, etc.),<br>
and only Level 3 Smart Cards will have the ability to receive and descramble certain other<br>
additional programs (e.g., PPV movies, etc.). It will be noted that the shares which are placed<br>
in the Level 1-3 smart cards comprise 'propositioned' information which may be used in<br>
conjunction with an 'activating' share to compute a secret (e.g., the descrambling key).<br>
Figure 6 shows how the multiple share scheme would be constructed using the<br>
Euclidean plane. As will be understood, the three different authorization levels correspond to<br>
the three y-intercepts (i.e., "regional key", "group key", "individual key"). The first-degree<br>
polynomial (corresponding to the Level 1 or 'regional' authorization) comprises a line passing<br>
through an 'activating share' and a Level 1 common share. The second-degree polynomial<br>
(corresponding to the Level 2 or 'group' authorization) comprises a parabola passing through<br>
the 'activating' share, the Level 1 common share, and a Level 2 share. The third-degree<br>
polynomial (corresponding to the Level 3 or 'individual' authorization) comprises a curve<br>
passing through the 'activating share', the Level 1 common share, the Level 2 share, and a<br>
Level 3 share. In the above example, it will be noted that the 'activating' share is used to<br>
compute each of the different keys (i.e., individual, group and regional). It should be noted<br>
that for demonstrative purposes the plot in Figure 6 is obtained using real numbers, and not<br>
modular arithmetic.<br>
Using the above example, the table below describes the relationship between<br>
the shares and the different authorization levels:<br><br>
Although the above-described method and apparatus have been described in<br>
the context of a conditional access system for delivering multimedia content, the principles of<br>
the present invention may also be applied to a method and apparatus for secure<br>
communications between a sender and receiver of information.<br>
Some of the advantages of the above-described method and apparatus include:<br>
(a) Reduction in computational requirements for the receiver in symmetric key<br>
recovery (i.e., for each key, only a simple operation is performed). This is in contrast to RSA<br>
decryption which involves modular exponentiation.<br>
(b) Security is 'perfect.' In other words, given the activating share, all values<br>
of the secret remain equally probable. For higher degree polynomials, the task of determining<br>
the secret given the activating share becomes even more difficult.<br>
© For a given set of 'prepositioned' information shared between a sender and<br>
receiver, different symmetric keys can be easily derived and frequently used (i.e., by changing<br>
the 'activating' share).<br>
(d) Different authorization levels can be defined by assigning different shares<br>
to the respective receivers.<br>
(e) Security does not rely on unproven mathematical assumptions (i.e., the<br>
security of RSA is based on the difficulty of the integer factorization problem).<br>
The above-described scheme effectively combines the advantages of<br>
symmetric and public key systems. The 'propositioned' information can be considered to be<br>
the private key of the receiver. The symmetric key to be constructed is determined by the<br>
public information sent as part of the ECM. As the descrambling keys are not generated at the<br>
source of the broadcast, no additional cipher is needed to protect them in distribution.<br>
The effectiveness of the above-described schemes can be increased in various<br>
ways including:<br>
(1) Defining the scrambling key as a function of the shared secret: In general,<br>
the key can be generated by evaluating a predefined function at the value of the secret. For<br>
example, if the shared secret (e.g., Y-intercept of the function f(x)) were the real number 7,<br>
the key might be defined as the square root of 7. In this way, even if one were to discover the<br>
secret, one does not necessarily have the ability to perform descrambling. Alternatively, any<br>
other definition can be used once the coefficients of the polynomial are obtained. For<br>
practical purposes, the function may need to have an entropy preserving property (i.e, entropy<br>
(secret) = entropy [f(secret)].<br>
(2) Making the degree of the polynomial function (and thus the number of<br>
shares needed to discover the secret) a time-dependent secret system parameter: e.g., the<br>
degree of the polynomial f(x) defining the secret would change from day-to-day, hour-to-<br>
hour, etc. Cryptanalysis would become a more demanding task for adversaries because they<br>
would have to first determine the degree of the polynomial.<br>
(3) Masking the activating share before transmission: The activating share<br>
transmitted with the scrambled content can then be unmasked by the receiver in a predefined<br>
process. An example of masking would be using a hash value of the activating share for<br>
content scrambling, but transmitting the activating share instead. Then, the receiver would<br>
perform hashing to determine the actual value.<br>
(4) Adding redundant activating shares: Additional activating shares<br>
transmitted with the actual activating share are filtered out by the receiver in a predefined<br>
process.<br>
Any combination of the above-referenced improvements will serve to hide the<br>
real value of the activating share in transmission, and introduces an additional level of security<br>
for the content.<br>
Although the invention has been described in terms of a secret sharing scheme<br>
which may use first, second and third degree polynomial equations in forming a secret, it will<br>
be understood by those skilled in the art that any degree polynomial equation (e.g., fourth<br>
degree, fifth degree, etc.) may be used. In fact, higher degree polynomial functions will be<br>
preferred in that they provide additional security over lower order polynomial functions due to<br>
the increased number of shares which must the estimated. Furthermore, although the above<br>
description focuses on a system with a single, smart card (e.g., smart card 42), it will be<br>
understood by those skilled in the art that multiple smart cards may be used, each smart card<br>
having one or more share values stored therein.<br>
