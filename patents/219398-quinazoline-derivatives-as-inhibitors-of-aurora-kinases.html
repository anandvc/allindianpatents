				<td>CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS<br>
The present invention relates to certain quinazoline derivatives for use in the treatment of certain diseases in particular to proliferative disease such as cancer and in the preparation of medicaments for use in the treatment of proliferative disease, to novel quinazoline compounds and to processes for their preparation, as well as pharmaceutical compositions containing them as active ingredient.<br>
Cancer (and other hyperproliferative disease) is characterised by uncontrolled cellular proliferation. This loss of the normal regulation of cell proliferation often appears to occur as the result of genetic damage to cellular pathways that control progress through the cell cycle. In eukaryotes, an ordered cascade of protein phosphorylation is thought to control the cell cycle. Several families of protein kinases that play critical roles in this cascade have now been identified. The activity of many of these kinases is increased in human tumours when compared to normal tissue. This can occur by either increased levels of expression of the protein (as a result of gene amplification for example), or by changes in expression of co activators or inhibitory proteins.<br>
The first identified, and most widely studied of these cell cycle regulators have been the cyclin dependent kinases (or CDKs). Activity of specific CDKs at specific times is essential for both initiation and coordinated progress through the cell cycle. For example, the CDK4 protein appears to control entry into the cell cycle (the GO-G1-S transition) by phosphorylating the retinoblastoma gene product pRb. This stimulates the release of the transcription factor E2F from pRb, which then acts to increase the transcription of genes necessary for entry into S phase. The catalytic activity of CDK4 is stimulated by binding to a partner protein, Cyclin D. One of the first demonstrations of a direct link between cancer and the cell cycle was made with the observation that the Cyclin Dl gene was amplified and cyclin D protein levels increased (and hence the activity of CDK4 increased) in many human tumours (Reviewed in Sherr, 1996, Science 274: 1672-1677; Pines, 1995, Seminars in Cancer Biology 6: 63-72). Other studies (Loda et al., 1997, Nature Medicine 3(2): 231-234; Gemma et al., 1996, International Journal of Cancer 68(5): 605-11; Elledge et al. 1996, Trends in Cell Biology 6; 388-392) have shown that negative regulators of CDK function are frequently down regulated or deleted in human tumours again leading to inappropriate activation of these kinases.<br>
More recently, protein kinases that are structurally distinct from the CDK family have been identified which play critical roles in regulating the cell cycle and which also appear to be important in oncogenesis. These include the newly identified human homologues of the Drosophila aurora and S.cerevisiae Ipll proteins. The three human homologues of these genes Aurora-A, Aurora-B and Aurora-C (also known as aurora2, auroral and aurora3 respectively) encode cell cycle regulated serine-threonine protein kinases (summarised in Adams et ai, 2001, Trends in Cell Biology. 11(2): 49-54). These show a peak of expression and kinase activity through G2 and mitosis. Several observations implicate the involvement of human aurora proteins in cancer. This evidence is particularly strong for Aurora-A. The Aurora-A gene maps to chromosome 20ql3, a region that is frequently amplified in human tumours including both breast and colon tumours. Aurora-A may be the major target gene of this amplicon, since Aurora-A DNA is amplified and mRNA overexpressed in greater than 50% of primary human colorectal cancers. In these tumours Aurora-A protein levels appear greatly elevated compared to adjacent normal tissue. In addition, transfection of rodent fibroblasts with human Aurora-A leads to transformation, conferring the ability to grow in soft agar and form tumours in nude mice (Bischoff et al., 1998, The EMBO Journal. 17(11): 3052-3065). Other work (Zhou et al., 1998, Nature Genetics. 20(2): 189-93) has shown that artificial overexpression of Aurora-A leads to an increase in centrosome number and an increase in aneuploidy, a known event in the development of cancer. Other work has shown an increase in expression of Aurora-B (Adams et al., 2001, Chromsoma. 110(2):65-74) and Aurora-C (Kimura et al, 1999, Journal of Biological Chemistry, 274(11): 7334-40) in tumour cells when compared to normal cells.<br>
Importantly, it has also been demonstrated that abrogation of Aurora-A expression and function by antisense oligonucleotide treatment of human tumour cell lines (WO 97/22702 and WO 99/37788) leads to cell cycle arrest and exerts an antiproliferative effect in these tumour cell lines. Additionally, small molecule inhibitors of Aurora-A and Aurora-B have been demonstrated to have an antiproliferative effect in human tumour cells (Keen et al. 2001, Poster #2455, American Association of Cancer research annual meeting). This indicates that inhibition of the function of Aurora-A (and possibly Aurora-B) will have an antiproliferative effect that may be useful in the treatment of human tumours and other hyperproliferative diseases. Further, inhibition of Aurora kinases as a therapeutic approach to these diseases may have significant advantages over targeting signalling pathways upstream of the cell cycle (e.g. those activated by growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases such as epidermal growth factor<br>
receptor (EGFR) or other receptors). Since the cell cycle is ultimately downstream of all of these diverse signalling events, cell cycle directed therapies such as inhibition of Aurora kinases would be predicted to be active across all proliferating tumour cells, whilst approaches directed at specific signalling molecules (e.g. EGFR) would be predicted to be active only in the subset of tumour cells which express those receptors. It is also believed that significant "cross talk" exists between these signalling pathways meaning that inhibition of one component may be compensated for by another.<br>
A number of quinazoline derivatives have been proposed hitherto for use in the inhibition of various kinases. For example, WO 96/09294, WO 96/15118 and WO 99/06378 describe the use of certain quinazoline compounds as receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors, which may be useful in the treatment of proliferative disease and WO 00/21955 discloses certain quinazoline derivatives as inhibitors of the effects of VEGF.<br>
Quinazoline derivatives have also been disclosed for use in the inhibition of Aurora-A kinase. WO 02/00649 discloses quinazoline derivative bearing a 5-membered heteroaromatic ring where the ring is, in particular, substituted thiazole or substituted thiophene. However despite the compounds of WO 02/00649 there still exists the need for further compounds having Aurora kinase inhibitory properties.<br>
The applicants have been successful in finding a novel series of compounds which inhibit the effects of the Aurora kinases and in particular Aurora-A kinase and which are thus of use in the treatment of proliferative disease such as cancer, in particular in such diseases such as colorectal or breast cancer where Aurora kinases are known to be active.<br>

In this specification the term alkyl when used either alone or as a suffix or prefix includes straight-chain and branched-chain saturated structures comprising carbon and hydrogen atoms. Unless otherwise stated, these groups may contain up to 10 carbon atoms (Ci-ioalkyl), preferably up to 6 carbon atoms (Ci-salkyl) and more preferably up to 4 carbon atoms (Ci-4alkyl). References to individual alkyl groups are specific for the straight-chain version only and references to individual branched-chain alkyl groups such as r-butyl are specific for the branched chain version only. For example Ci^alkyl includes the examples of methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl and rert-butyl where the ethyl, propyl and butyl groups may be<br>
bonded at the 1 or 2 position (e.g. prop-1-yl and prop-2-yl). A similar analysis of alkyl groups having different ranges of carbon atoms can be performed.<br>
Similarly the terms alkenyl and alkynyl refer to unsaturated straight-chain or branched-chain structures containing for example from 2 to 10 carbon atoms (Cz-ioalkenyl and Ci-loalkynyl) and preferably from 2 to 6 carbon atoms (C2-ealkenyl and C2-6alkynyl) and more preferably 2 to 4 carbon atoms (C2-4alkenyl and Cj^alkynyl). Again references to individual groups are specific for the straight-chain version only and references to individual branched-chain groups are specific for the branched chain version only. The above comment concerning the bonding position of alkyl is applicable to alkenyl and alkynyl groups.<br>
Cyclic moieties such as cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl and cycloalkynyl are similar in nature but have at least 3 carbon atoms, the following terms thus being used in the specification to indicate the minimum and maximum number of carbon atoms in the rings: Ca-iocycloalkyl, €3. locycloalkenyl and C3.10cycloalkynyl and preferably C3-6cycloalkyl, Cs-gcycloalkenyl and €3. ecycloalkynyl and most preferably Cs^cycloalkyl.<br>
Terms such as alkoxy comprise alkyl groups as is understood in the art and thus contain up to 10 carbon atoms (Ci.ioalkoxy), preferably up to 6 carbon atoms (Ci-ealkoxy) and more preferably up to 4 carbon atoms (C|.4alkoxy).<br>
The term halo includes fluoro, chloro, bromo and iodo.<br>
References to aryl groups include aromatic carbocyclic groups such as phenyl and naphthyl.<br>
The terms heterocyclyl and heterocyclic group include (unless specifically stated) aromatic or non-aromatic rings and may comprise more than one ring (e.g. they are monocyclic, bicyclic or tricyclic and preferably they are monocyclic and bicyclic), for example containing from 4 to 20, suitably from 5 to 8 ring atoms, at least one of which is a heteroatom such as oxygen, sulphur or nitrogen. Examples of such groups include furyl, thienyl, pyrrolyl, pyrrolidinyl, imidazolyl, triazolyl, thiazolyl, tetrazolyl, oxazolyl, isoxazolyl, pyrazolyl, pyridyl, pyrimidinyl, pyrazinyl, pyridazinyl, triazinyl, quinolinyl, isoquinolinyl, quinoxalinyl, benzothiazolyl, benzoxazolyl, benzothienyl or benzofuryl.<br>
Heteroaryl refers to those heterocyclyl groups described above which have an aromatic character.<br>
The term aralkyl refers to aryl substituted alkyl groups such as benzyl.<br>
Other expressions used in the specification include hydrocarbyl which refers to any structure comprising carbon and hydrogen atoms. For example, these may be alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, aryl, heterocyclyl, alkoxy, aralkyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl or cycloalkynyl.<br>
The term functional group refers to reactive substituents such as nitro, cyano, halo, oxo, =CR78R79, C(O)XR77, OR77, S(O)yR77, NR78R79, C(O)NR78R79, OC(O)NR78R79, =NOR77, -NfR77C(O)IR78, -NR77CONR78R79, -N=CR78R79, S(0)yNR78R79 or -NR77S(O)yR78 where R77, R78 and R79 are independently selected from hydrogen or optionally substituted hydrocarbyl, or R78 and R79 together form an optionally substituted ring which optionally contains further heteroatoms such as S(O)y oxygen and nitrogen, x is an integer of 1 or 2, y is 0,1, 2 or 3.<br>
Suitable optional substituents for hydrocarbyl groups R77, R78 and R79 include halo, perhaloalkyl such as trifluoromethyl, mercapto, hydroxy, carboxy, alkoxy, aryl, heteroaryl, heteroaryloxy, alkenyloxy, alkynyloxy, alkoxyalkoxy, aryloxy (where the aryl group may be substituted by halo, nitro, or hydroxy), cyano, nitro, amino, mono- or di-alkyl amino, oximino or S(O)y where y is as defined above.<br>
Suitable optional substituents for any hydrocarbyl group, heterocyclyl group or C|. i0alkoxy group (unless specifically stated) include halo, perhaloalkyl such as trifluoromethyl, mercapto, hydroxy, carboxy, alkoxy, aryl, heteroaryl, heteroaryloxy, alkenyloxy, alkynyloxy, alkoxyalkoxy, aryloxy (where the aryl group may be substituted by halo, nitro, or hydroxy), cyano, nitro, amino, mono- or di-alkyl amino, oximino or S(O)y where y is as defined above.<br>
Where optional substituents are chosen from one of more groups or substituents it is to be understood that this definition includes all substituents being chosen from one of the specified groups i.e. all substitutents being the same, or the substituents being chosen from two or more of the specified groups i.e. the substituents not being the sarnc. Preferably one or more means 1, 2, 3 or 4 but one or more may also means 1, 2 or 3 or 1 or 2.<br>
Where a compound of formula (I), formula (IA) or formula (IB) contains more than one specific R group it is to be understood that each selection made for such a group is independent from any other selection made for that same group, for example when a compound of formula (I) contains more than one R77 group, e'ach R77 group can the same as the other R77 groups or different.<br>
Within this specification composite terms are used to describe group comprising more than one functionality such as Ci^alkoxyCi-salkyl. Such terms are to be interpreted as is understood in the art.<br>
Unless specifically stated the bonding atom of a group may be any atom of that group so for example propyl includes prop-1-yl and prop-2-yl.<br>

Within the present invention it is to be understood that a compound of the formula (I), formula (LA) or formula (IB) or a salt, ester or amide thereof may exhibit the phenomenon of tautomerism and that the formulae drawings within this specification can represent only one of the possible tautomeric forms. It is to be understood that the invention encompasses any tautomeric form which has Aurora kinase inhibition activity and in particular Aurora-A kinase or Aurora-B kinase inhibition activity and is not to be limited merely to any one tautomeric form utilized within the formulae drawings. The formulae drawings within this specification can represent only one of the possible tautomeric forms and it is to be understood that the specification encompasses all possible tautomeric forms of the compounds drawn not just those forms which it has been possible to show graphically herein. The possibility of tautomeric forms is particular pertinent for R5 when R62 is hydrogen.<br>

The present invention relates to the compounds of formula (I), formula (LA) or formula (IB) as defined herein as well as to the salts thereof. Salts for use in pharmaceutical compositions will be pharmaceutically acceptable salts, but other salts may be useful in the production of compounds of formula (I), formula (IA) or formula (IB) and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds of formula (I), formula (LA) or formula (IB) include acid addition salts such as rnethanesulphonate, fumarate, hydrochloride, hydrobromide, citrate, maleate and salts formed with phosphoric and sulphuric acid. There may be more than one cation or anion depending on the number of charged functions and the valency of the cations or anions. Where the compound of formula (I), formula (IA) or formula (IB) includes an acid functionality, salts may be base salts such as an alkali metal salt for example sodium, an alkaline earth metal salt for example calcium or magnesium, an organic amine salt for example triethylamine, morpholine, N-methylpiperidine, W-ethylpiperidine, procaine, dibenzylamine, A^-dibenzylethylamine, ethanolamine, diethanolamine or amino acids for example lysine. A preferred pharmaceutically acceptable salt is a sodium salt.<br>
The invention also provides for an in vivo hydrolysable ester of a compound of formula (I), formula (IA) or formula (IB) containing carboxy or hydroxy group. Such an ester is, for example, a pharmaceutically acceptable ester which is hydrolysed in the human or animal body to produce the parent acid or alcohol.<br>
Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable esters for carboxy include Ci-galkyl esters such as methyl or ethyl esters, Ci.6alkoxymethyl esters for example methoxymethyl, Ci-ealkanoyloxymethyl esters for example pivaloyloxymethyl, phthalidyl esters, Cs-gcycloalkoxy-carbonyloxyCi-ealkyl esters for example 1-cyclohexylcarbonyloxyethyl; l,3-dioxolen-2-onylmethyl esters for example 5-methyl-l,3-dioxolen-2-onylmethyl; and Ci-ealkoxycarbonyloxyethyl esters for example 1-methoxycarbonyloxyethyl and may be formed at any carboxy group in the compounds of this invention.<br>
An in vivo hydrolysable ester of a compound of formula (I), formula (IA) or formula (IB) containing a hydroxy group includes inorganic esters such as phosphate esters and a-acyloxyalkyl ethers and related compounds which as a result of the in vivo hydrolysis of the ester breakdown to give the parent hydroxy group. Examples of a-acyloxyalky] ethers include<br>
acetoxymethoxy and 2,2-dimethylpropionyloxymethoxy.

It will be appreciated that certain of the various ring substituents in the compounds of the present invention may be introduced by standard aromatic substitution reactions or generated by conventional functional group modifications either prior to or immediately following the processes mentioned above, and as such are included in the process aspect of the invention. Such reactions and modifications include, for example, introduction of a substituent by means of an aromatic substitution reaction, reduction of substituents, alkylation of substituents and oxidation of substituents. The reagents and reaction conditions for such procedures are well known in the chemical art. Particular examples of aromatic substitution reactions include the introduction of a nitro group using concentrated nitric acid, the introduction of an acyl group using, for example, an acyl halide and Lewis acid (such as aluminium trichloride) under Friedel Crafts conditions; the introduction of an alkyl group using an alky] halide and Lewis acid (such as aluminium trichloride) under Friedel Crafts conditions; and the introduction of a halogen group. Particular examples of modifications include the reduction of a nitro group to an amino group by for example, catalytic hydrogenation with a nickel catalyst or treatment with iron in the presence of hydrochloric acid with heating; oxidation of alkylthio to alkylsulphinyl or alkylsulphonyl. It will also be appreciated that in some of the reactions mentioned herein it may be necessary/desirable to protect any sensitive groups in the compounds. The instances where protection is necessary or desirable and suitable methods for protection are known to those skilled in the art. Conventional protecting groups may be used in accordance with standard practice (for illustration see T.W. Green, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley and Sons, 1991). Thus, if reactants include groups such as amino, carboxy or hydroxy it may be desirable to protect the group in some of the reactions mentioned herein.<br>
A suitable protecting group for an amino or alkylamino group is, for example, an acyl group, for example an alkanoyl group such as acetyl, an alkoxycarbonyl group, for example a methoxycarbonyl, ethoxycarbonyl or f-butpxycarbonyl group, an arylmethoxycarbony] group, for example benzyloxycarbonyl, or an aroyl group, for example benzoyl. The deprotection conditions for the above protecting groups necessarily vary with the choice of protecting group. Thus, for example, an acyl group such as an alkanoyl or alkoxycarbony] group or an aroyl group may be removed for example, by hydrolysis with a suitable base such as an alkali metal hydroxide, for example lithium or sodium hydroxide. Alternatively an acyl group such<br>
as a f-butoxycarbonyl group may be removed, for example, by treatment with a suitable acid as hydrochloric, sulphuric or phosphoric acid or trifluoroacetic acid and an arylmethoxycarbonyl group such as a benzyloxycarbony] group may be removed, for example, by hydrogenation over a catalyst such as palladium-on-carbon, or by treatment with a Lewis acid for example boron tris(trifluoroacetate). A suitable alternative protecting group for a primary amino group is, for example, a phthaloyl group which may be removed by treatment with an alkylamine, for example dimethylaminopropylamine, or with hydrazine.<br>
A suitable protecting group for a hydroxy group is, for example, an acyl group, for example an alkanoyi group such as acetyl, an aroyl group, for example benzoyl, or an arylmethy] group, for example benzyl. The deprotection conditions for the above protecting groups will necessarily vary with the choice of protecting group. Thus, for example, an acyl group such as an alkanoy] or an aroyl group may be removed, for example, by hydrolysis with a suitable base such as an alkali metal hydroxide, for example lithium or sodium hydroxide. Alternatively an arylmethyl group such as a benzyl group may be removed, for example, by hydrogenation over a catalyst such as palladium-on-carbon.<br>
A suitable protecting group for a carboxy group is, for example, an esterifying group, for example a methyl or an ethyl group which may be removed, for example, by hydrolysis with a base such as sodium hydroxide, or for example a r-butyl group which may be removed, for example, by treatment with an acid, for example an organic acid such as trifluoroacetic acid, or for example a benzyl group which may be removed, for example, by hydrogenation over a catalyst such as palladium-on-carbon.<br>
The protecting groups may be removed at any convenient stage in the synthesis using conventional techniques well known in the chemical art.<br>

*<br>
The compositions of the invention may be obtained by conventional procedures using conventional pharmaceutical excipients, well known in the art. Thus, compositions intended for oral use may contain, for example, one or more colouring, sweetening, flavouring and/or preservative agents.<br>
Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipients for a tablet formulation include, for example, inert diluents such as lactose, sodium carbonate, calcium phosphate or calcium carbonate, granulating and disintegrating agents such as corn starch or algenic acid; binding agents such as starch; lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc; preservative agents such as ethyl or propyl g-hydroxybenzoate, and anti-oxidants, such as ascorbic acid. Tablet formulations may be uncoated or coated either to modify their disintegration and the subsequent absorption of the active ingredient within the gastrointestinal track, or to improve their stability and/or appearance, in either case, using conventional coating agents and procedures well known in the art.<br>
Compositions for oral use may be in the form of hard gelatin capsules in which the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules in which the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil such as peanut oil, liquid paraffin, soya bean oil, coconut oil, or preferably olive oil, or any other acceptable vehicle<br>
Aqueous suspensions generally contain the active ingredient in finely powdered form together with one or more suspending agents, such as sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinyl-pyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia; dispersing or wetting agents such as lecithin or condensation products of an alkylene oxide with fatty acids (for example polyoxyethylene stearate), or<br>
condensation products of ethylene oxide with long chain aliphatic alcohols, for example heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and a hexitol such as polyoxyethylene sorbitol monooleate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with long chain aliphatic alcohols, for example heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and a hexitol such as polyoxyethylene sorbitol monooleate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example polyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The aqueous suspensions may also contain one or more preservatives (such as ethyl or propyl r&gt;hydroxybenzoate, anti-oxidants (such as ascorbic acid), colouring agents, flavouring agents, and/or sweetening agents (such as sucrose, saccharine or aspartame).<br>
Oily suspensions may be formulated by suspending the active ingredient in a vegetable oil (such as arachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil or coconut oil) or in a mineral oil (such as liquid paraffin). The oily suspensions may also contain a thickening agent such as beeswax, hard paraffin orcetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents such as those set out above, and flavouring agents may be added to provide a palatable oral preparation. These compositions may be preserved by the addition of an anti-oxidant such as ascorbic acid.<br>
Dispersible or lyophilised powders and granules suitable for preparation of an aqueous suspension or solution by the addition of water generally contain the active ingredient together with a dispersing or wetting agent, suspending agent and one or more preservatives. Suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents are exemplified by those already mentioned above. Additional excipients such as sweetening, flavouring and colouring agents, may also be present.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may also be in the form of oil-in-water emulsions. The oily phase may be a vegetable oil, such as olive oil or arachis oil, or a mineral oil, such as for example liquid paraffin or a mixture of any of these. Suitable emulsifying agents may be, for example, naturally-occurring gums such as gum acacia or gum tragacanth, naturally-occurring phosphatides such as soya bean, lecithin, an esters or partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides (for example sorbitan monooleate) and condensation products of the said partial esters with ethylene oxide such as polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The emulsions may also contain sweetening, flavouring and preservative agents.<br>
Syrups and elixirs may be formulated with sweetening agents such as glycerol, propylene glycol, sorbitol, aspartame or sucrose, and may also contain a demulcent, preservative, flavouring and/or colouring agent.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions may also be in the form of a sterile injectable aqueous or oily suspension, solutions, emulsions or particular systems, which may be formulated according to known procedures using one or more of the appropriate dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents, which have been mentioned above. A sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally-acceptable diluent or solvent, for example a solution in polyethylene glycol. Suppository formulations may be prepared by mixing the active ingredient with a suitable non-irritating excipient which is solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to release the drug. Suitable excipients include, for example, cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols.<br>
Topical formulations, such as creams, ointments, gels and aqueous or oily solutions or suspensions, may generally be obtained by formulating an active ingredient with a conventional, topically acceptable, vehicle or diluent using conventional procedure well known in the art.<br>
Compositions for administration by insufflation may be in the form of a finely divided powder containing particles of average diameter of, for example, 30(j.m or much less preferably 5|j,m or less and more preferably between 5(im and lu,m, the powder itself comprising either active ingredient alone or diluted with one or more physiologically acceptable carriers such as lactose. The powder for insufflation is then conveniently retained in a capsule containing, for example, 1 to 50mg of active ingredient for use with a turbo-inhaler device, such as is used for insufflation of the known agent sodium cromoglycate.<br>
Compositions for administration by inhalation may be in the form of a conventional pressurised aerosol arranged to dispense the active ingredient either as an aerosol containing finely divided solid or liquid droplets. Conventional aerosol propellants such as volatile fluorinated hydrocarbons or hydrocarbons may be used and the aerosol device is conveniently arranged to dispense a metered quantity of active ingredient.<br>
For further information on Formulation the reader is referred to Chapter 25.2 in Volume 5 of Comprehensive Medicinal Chemistry (Corwin Hansch; Chairman of Editorial Board), Pergamon Press 1990.<br>
The amount of active ingredient that is combined with one or more excipients to produce a single dosage form will necessarily vary depending upon the host treated and the particular route of administration. For example, a formulation intended for oral administration to humans will generally contain, for example, from 0.5 mg to 2 g of active agent compounded with an appropriate and convenient amount of excipients which may vary from about 5 to about 98 percent by weight of the total composition. Dosage unit forms will generally contain about 1 mg to about 500 mg of an active ingredient. For further information on Routes of Administration and Dosage Regimes the reader is referred to Chapter 25.3 in Volume 5 of Comprehensive Medicinal Chemistry (Corwin Hansch; Chairman of Editorial Board), Pergamon Press 1990.<br>
The size of the dose for therapeutic or prophylactic purposes of a compound of the fonnula (I), formula (IA) or formula (IB) will naturally vary according to the nature and severity of the conditions, the age and sex of the animal or patient and the route of administration, according to well known principles of medicine. As mentioned above, compounds of the fonnula (I), formula (IB) or fonnula (IA) are useful in treating diseases or medical conditions which are due alone or in part to the effects of Aurora-A kinase and also due alone or in part to the effects of Aurora-B kinase.<br>
In using a compound of the formula (I), formula (IA) or formula (IB) for therapeutic or prophylactic purposes it will generally be administered so that a daily dose in the range, for example, 0.5 mg to 75 mg per kg body weight is received and but a range of 0.1 mg to 75 mg may also be required, given if required in divided doses. In general lower doses will be administered when a parenteral route is employed. Thus, for example, for intravenous administration, a dose in the range, for example, 0.5 mg to 30 mg per kg body weight will generally be used but a range of O.I mg to 25 mg may be required. Similarly, for administration by inhalation, a dose in the range, for example, 0.5 mg to 25 mg per kg body weight will be used.<br>
A further aspect of the invention comprises a compound of formula (I), formula (IA) or formula (IB) as defined above, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or in vivo hydrolysable ester thereof, for use in the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of proliferate disease. Preferred compounds of formula (I), formula (IA) or formula (IB) for this purpose are as described above.<br>
In addition to their use in therapeutic medicine, a compound of formula (I) or formula (IA) and the pharmaceutically acceptable salt is also useful as pharmacological tool in the<br>
development and standardisation of in vitro and in vivo test systems for the evaluation of the effects of inhibitors of cell cycle activity in laboratory animals such as cats, dogs, rabbits, monkeys, rats and mice, as part of the search fro new therapeutic agents.

As stated hereinbefore the compounds of the invention inhibit the serine-threonine kinase activity of Aurora kinase and in particular of Aurora-A kinase and/or Aurora-B kinase and<br>
thus inhibit the cell cycle and cell proliferation. These properties may be assessed, for example, using one or more of the procedures set out below:<br>
(a) In Vitro Aurora-A kinase inhibition test<br>
This assay determines the ability of a test compound to inhibit serine-threonine kinase activity. DNA encoding Aurora-A may be obtained by total gene synthesis or by cloning. This DNA may then be expressed in a suitable expression system to obtain polypeptide with serine-threonine kinase activity. In the case of Aurora-A, the coding sequence was isolated from cDNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and cloned into the BamHl and Notl restriction endonuclease sites of the baculovirus expression vector pFastBac HTc (GibcoBRL/Life technologies). The 5' PCR primer contained a recognition sequence for the restriction endonuclease BamHl 5' to the Aurora-A coding sequence. This allowed the insertion of the Aurora-A gene in frame with the 6 histidine residues, spacer region and rTEV protease cleavage site encoded by the pFastBac HTc vector. The 3' PCR primer replaced the Aurora-A stop codon with additional coding sequence followed by a stop codon and a recognition sequence for the restriction endonuclease Notl. This additional coding sequence (51 TAG CCA TAG GAT GTT CCA GAT TAG GCT TCT TAA 3') encoded for the polypeptide sequence YPYDVPDYAS. This sequence, derived from the influenza hemagglutin protein, is frequently used as a tag epitope sequence that can be identified using specific monoclonal antibodies. The recombinant pFastBac vector therefore encoded for an N-terminally 6 his tagged, C terminally influenza hemagglutin epitope tagged Aurora-A protein. Details of the methods for the assembly of recombinant DNA molecules can be found in standard texts, for example Sambrook et al. 1989, Molecular Cloning - A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Edition, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory press and Ausubel et al. 1999, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley and Sons Inc.<br>
Production of recombinant virus can be performed following manufacturer's protocol from GibcoBRL. Briefly, the pFastBac-1 vector carrying the Aurora-A gene was transformed into E. coli DHlOBac cells containing the baculovirus genome (bacmid DNA) and via a transposition event in the cells, a region of the pFastBac vector containing gentamycin resistance gene and the Aurora-A gene including the baculovirus polyhedrin promoter was transposed directly into the bacmid DNA. By selection on gentamycin, kanamycin, tetracycline and X-gal, resultant white colonies should contain recombinant bacmid DNA encoding Aurora-A. Bacmid DNA was extracted from a small scale culture of several<br>
BHIOBac white colonies and transfected into Spodoptera frugiperda Sf21 cells grown in TCI00 medium (GibcoBRL) containing 10% serum using CellFECTIN reagent (GibcoBRL) following manufacturer's instructions. Virus particles were harvested by collecting cell culture medium 72 hrs post transfection. 0.5 mis of medium was used to infect 100 ml suspension culture of Sf21s containing 1 x 107 cells/ml. Cell culture medium was harvested 48 hrs post infection and virus titre determined using a standard plaque assay procedure. Virus stocks were used to infect Sf9 and "High 5" cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 3 to ascertain expression of recombinant Aurora-A protein.<br>
For the large scale expression of Aurora-A kinase activity, Sf21 insect cells were grown at 28°C in TC100 medium supplemented with 10% foetal calf serum (Viralex) and 0.2% F68 Pluronic (Sigma) on a Wheaton roller rig at 3 r.p.m. When the cell density reached 1.2xl06 cells ml"1 they were infected with plaque-pure Aurora-A recombinant virus at a multiplicity of infection of 1 and harvested 48 hours later. All subsequent purification steps were performed at 4°C. Frozen insect cell pellets containing a total of 2.0 x 108 cells were thawed and diluted with lysis buffer (25 mMHEPES (N-[2-hydroxyethyl]piperazine-N'-[2-ethanesulphonic acid]) pH7.4 at 4°C , 100 mM KC1, 25 mM NaF, 1 mM Na3VO4,1 mM PMSF (phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride), 2 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mM imidazole, 1 /ig/ml aprotinin, 1 ng/ml pepstatin, 1 /ig/ml leupeptin), using 1.0 ml per 3 x 107 cells. Lysis was achieved using a dounce homogeniser, following which the lysate was centrifuged at 41,000g for 35 minutes. Aspirated supernatant was pumped onto a 5 mm diameter chromatography column containing 500 /il Ni NTA (nitrilo-tri-acetic acid) agarose (Qiagen, product no. 30250) which had been equilibrated in lysis buffer. A baseline level of UV absorbance for the eluent was reached after washing the column with 12 ml of lysis buffer followed by 7 ml of wash buffer (25 mM HEPES pH7.4 at 4°C , 100 mM KC1, 20 mM imidazole, 2 mM 2-mercaptoethanol). Bound Aurora-A protein was eluted from the column using elution buffer (25 mM HEPES pH7.4 at 4°C , 100 mM KC1, 400 mM imidazole, 2 mM 2-mercaptoethanol). An elution fraction (2.5 ml) corresponding to the peak in UV absorbance was collected. The elution fraction, containing active Aurora-A kinase, was dialysed exhaustively against dialysis buffer (25 mM HEPES pH7.4 at 4°C , 45% glycerol (v/v), 100 mM KC1, 0.25% Nonidet P40 (v/v), 1 mM dithiothreitol).<br>
Each new batch of Aurora-A enzyme was titrated in the assay by dilution with enzyme diluent (25mM Tris-HCl pH7.5, 12.5mM KC1, 0.6mM DTT). For a typical batch, stock<br>
enzyme is diluted 1 in 666 with enzyme diluent &amp; 20^.1 of dilute enzyme is used for each assay well. Test compounds (at lOmM in dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) were diluted with water &amp; lOuJ of diluted compound was transferred to wells in the assay plates. "Total" &amp; "blank" control wells contained 2.5% DMSO instead of compound. Twenty microlitres of freshly diluted enzyme was added to all wells, apart from "blank" wells. Twenty microlitres of enzyme diluent was added to "blank" wells. Twenty mjcrolitres of reaction mix (25mM Tris-HCl, 78.4mM KC1, 2.5mM NaF, 0.6mM dithiothreitol, 6.25mM MnCl2, 6.25mM ATP, 7.5uM peptide substrate [biotin-LRRWSLGLRRWSLGLRRWSLGLRRWSLG]) containing 0.2(10 [Y"P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia, specific activity &gt;2500Ci/mmol) was then added to all test wells to start the reaction. The plates were incubated at room temperature for 60 minutes. To stop the reaction lOOjil 20% v/v orthophosphoric acid was added to all wells. The peptide substrate was captured on positively-charged nitrocellulose P30 filtermat (Whatman) using a 96-well plate harvester (TomTek) &amp; then assayed for incorporation of 33P with a Beta plate counter. "Blank" (no enzyme) and "total" (no compound) control values were used to determine the dilution range of test compound which gave 50% inhibition of enzyme activity. In this test, the compounds of the invention give 50% inhibition of enzyme activity at concentrations of O.OOOluM to 1.5uM and in particular compound 8 in Table 3 gave 50% inhibition of enzyme activity at a concentration of O.OlfiM and compound 13 in Table 3 gave 50% inhibition of enzyme activity at a concentration of O.OOluM.<br>
(b) In Vitro Aurora-B kinase inhibition test<br>
This assay determines the ability of a test compound to inhibit serine-threonine kinase activity. DNA encoding Aurora-B may be obtained by total gene synthesis or by cloning. This DNA may then be expressed in a suitable expression system to obtain polypeptide with serine-threonine kinase activity. In the case of Aurora-B, the coding sequence was isolated from cDNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and cloned into the pFastBac system in a manner similar to that described above for Aurora-A (i.e. to direct expression of a 6-histidine tagged Aurora-B protein).<br>
For the large scale expression of Aurora-B kinase activity, Sf21 insect cells were grown at 28°C in TC100 medium supplemented with 10% foetal calf serum (Viralex) and 0.2% F68 Pluronic (Sigma) on a Wheaton roller rig at 3 r.p.m. When the cell density reached 1.2xl06 cells ml"' they were infected with plaque-pure Aurora-B recombinant virus at a<br>
multiplicity of infection of 1 and harvested 48 hours later. All subsequent purification steps were performed at 4°C. Frozen insect cell pellets containing a total of 2.0 x 108 cells were thawed and diluted with lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES (N-[2-hydroxyethyl]piperazine-N'-[2-ethanesulphonic acid]) pH7.5 at 4°C , 1 mM Na3V04r 1 mM PMSF (phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride), 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 /ig/ml aprotinin, 1 /zg/ml pepstatin, 1 jig/ml leupeptin), using 1.0 ml per 2 x 107 cells. Lysis was achieved using a sonication homogeniser, following which the lysate was centrifuged at 41,000g for 35 minutes. Aspirated supernatant was pumped onto a 5 mm diameter chromatography column containing 1.0 ml CM sepharose,Fast Flow (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) which had been equilibrated in lysis buffer. A baseline level of UV absorbance for the eluent was reached after washing the column with 12 ml of lysis buffer followed by 7 ml of wash buffer (50 mM HEPES pH7.4 at 4°C , 1 mM dithiothreitol). Bound Aurora-B B protein was eluted from the column using a gradient of elution buffer (50 mM HEPES pH7.4 at 4°C , 0.6 M Nad, 1 mM dithiothreitol, running from 0% elution buffer to 100% elution buffer over 15 minutes at a flowrate of 0.5 ml/min). Elution fractions (1.0 ml) corresponding to the peak in UV absorbance was collected. Elution fractions were dialysed exhaustively against dialysis buffer (25 mM HEPES pH7.4 at 4°C , 45% glycerol (v/v), 100 mM KC1, 0.05% (v/v) IGEPAL CA630 (Sigma Aldrich), 1 mM dithiothreitol). Dialysed fractions were assayed for Aurora-B kinase activity.<br>
Each new batch of Aurora-B enzyme was titrated in the assay by dilution with enzyme diluent (25mM Tris-HCl pH7.5, 12.5mM KC1, 0.6mM DTT). For a typical batch, stock enzyme is diluted 1 in 40 with enzyme diluent &amp; 20ul of dilute enzyme is used for each assay well. Test compounds (at lOmM in dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) were diluted with water &amp; lOjil of diluted compound was transferred to wells in the assay plates. "Total" &amp; "blank" control wells contained 2.5% DMSO instead of compound. Twenty microlitres of freshly diluted enzyme was added to all wells, apart from "blank" wells. Twenty microlitres of enzyme diluent was added to "blank" wells. Twenty microlitres of reaction mix (25mM Tris-HCl, 78.4mM KC1, 2.5mM NaF, 0.6mM dithiothreitol, 6.25mM MnCl2, 37.5mM ATP, 25uM peptide substrate [biotin-LRRWSLGLRRWSLGLRRWSLGLRRWSLG]) containing 0.2nCi [y"P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia, specific activity &gt;2500Ci/mmoI) was then added to all test wells to start the reaction. The plates were incubated at room temperature for 60 minutes. To stop the reaction lOOpJ 20% v/v orthophosphoric acid was added to all wells. The peptide substrate was captured on positively-charged nitrocellulose P30 filtermat (Whatman) using a<br>
96-well plate harvester (TomTek) &amp; then assayed for incorporation of 33P with a Beta plate counter. "Blank" (no enzyme) and "total" (no compound) control values were used to determine the dilution range of test compound which gave 50% inhibition of enzyme activity.<br>
(c) In Vitro cell proliferation assay<br>
This and other assays can be used to determine the ability of a test compound to inhibit the growth of adherent mammalian cell lines, for example the human tumour cell line SW620 (ATCC CCL-227). This assay determines the ability of at test compound to inhibit the incorporation of the thymidine analogue, 5'-bromo-2'-deoxy-uridine (BrdU) into cellular DNA. SW620 or other adherent cells were typically seeded at IxlO5 cells per well in L-15 media (GIBCO) plus 5% foetal calf serum, 1% L-glutamine (lOOuJ / well) in 96 well tissue culture treated 96 well plates (Costar) and allowed to adhere overnight. The following day the cells were dosed with compound (diluted from lOmM stock in DMSO using L-15 (with 5% PCS, 1% L-glutamine). Untreated control wells and wells containing a compound known to give 100% inhibition of BrdU incorporation were included on each plate. After 48 hours in the presence / absence of test compound the ability of the cells to incorporate BrdU over a 2 hour labelling period was determined using a Boehringer (Roche) Cell Proliferation BrdU ELISA kit (cat. No. 1 647 229) according to manufacturers directions. Briefly, 15(J,1 of BrdU labelling reagent (diluted 1:100 in media - L-15, 5% PCS, 1% L-glutamine) was added to each well and the plate returned to a humidified (+5% CO2) 37°C incubator for 2 hours. After 2 hours the labelling reagent was removed by decanting and tapping the plate on a paper towel. FixDenat solution (50fil per well) was added and the plates incubated at room temperature for 45mins with shaking. The FixDenat solution was removed by decanting and tapping the inverted plate on a paper towel. The plate was then washed once with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and 100^1 /well of Anti-BrdU-POD antibody solution (diluted 1:100 in antibody dilution buffer) added. The plate was then incubated at room temperature with shaking for 90min. Unbound Anti-BrdU-POD antibody was removed by decanting and washing the plate 4 times with PBS before being blotted dry. TMB substrate solution was added (100u,l/well) and incubated for approximately 10 minutes at room temperature with shaking until a colour change was apparent. The optical density of the wells was then determined at 690nm wavelength using a Titertek Multiscan plate reader. The values from compound treated, untreated and 100% inhibition controls were used to determine the dilution<br>
Is of in table<br>
range of a test compound that gave 50% inhibition of BrdU incorporation. The compound the invention are active at O.OOlMM to 10uM in this test and in particular compound 8 in t£ 3 was active at 0.086M.M and compound 13 in table 3 was active at 0.079nM.<br>
(d) In Vitro cell cycle analysis assay<br>
This assay determines the ability of a test compound to arrest cells in specific phases of the cell cycle. Many different mammalian cell lines could be used in this assay and SW620 cells are included here as an example. SW620 cells were seeded at 7 x 105 cells per T25 flask (Costar) in 5 ml L-15 (5% PCS, 1% L-glutamine). Flasks were then incubated overnight in a humidified 37°C incubator with 5% CO2. The following day, 5^1 of L-15 (5% PCS, 1% L-glutamine) carrying the appropriate concentration of test compound solubilised in DMSO was added to the flask . A no compound control treatments was also included (0.5% DMSO). The cells were then incubated for a defined time (24 hours) with compound. After this time the media was aspirated from the cells and they were washed with 5ml of prewarmed (37 C) sterile PBS A, then detached from the flask by brief incubation with trypsin and followed by resuspension in 5ml of 1% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA, Sigma-Aldrich Co.) in sterile PBSA. The samples were then centrifuged at 2200rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was aspirated to leave 200^1 of the PBS/BSA solution. The pellet was resuspended in this 200uJ of solution by pipetting 10 times to create a single cell suspension. One ml of ice-cold 80% ethanol was slowly added to each cell suspension and the samples stored at -20°C overnight or until required for staining. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation, ethanol aspirated off and pellets resuspended in 200^1 PBS containing 100u.g/ml RNAse (Sigma Aldrich) &amp; 10|ig/ml Propidium Iodide (Sigma Aldrich). Cell suspensions were incubated at 37°C for 30min, a further 200uJ PBS added and samples stored in the dark at 4°C overnight. Each sample was then syringed 10 times using 21-guage needle. The samples were then transferred to LPS tubes and DNA content per cell analysed by Fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) using a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). Typically 30,000 events were counted and recorded using CellQuest vl.l software (Verity Software). Cell cycle distribution of the population was calculated using Modfit software (Verity Software) and expressed as percentage of cells with 2N (GO/G1), 2N-4N (S phase) and with 4N (G2/M) DNA content.<br>
