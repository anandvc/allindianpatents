				<td>KEYPAD ARRAY FOR INPUTTING HINDI LANGUAGE IN MOBILE PHONE AND<br>
INPUTTING METHOD THEREOF<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention	relates to a keypad array for<br>
inputting a Hindi language	in a mobile phone, and more<br>
particularly to a keypad array of a keyboard or a mobile<br>
terminal such as a mobile	phone and a Personal Digital<br>
Assistant (PDA), having an	improved system enabling more<br>
efficient input of characters	of a Hindi language.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
In general mobile communication devices such as a. mobile<br>
phone and a PDA being recently prevailing, a machine-human<br>
interface is equipped with a mechanical or physical keypad. The<br>
use range of the keypad has been greatly expanding from simple<br>
input of numerical data at first to input of characters for a<br>
short message service (SMS).<br>
When applying English or other languages having similar<br>
vowel and consonant systems to English, inputting of characters<br>
can be relatively easily accomplished by compositely inputting<br>
vowels and consonants. Accordingly, an English character<br>
inputting system is widely used in from the Western countries<br><br>
having an advanced technology about the mobile devices<br>
gradually to Asian countries.<br>
Generally, character inputting systems of recent days<br>
input characters based on pronunciation regardless whether the<br>
characters are ideographs or phonetic symbols. Since most of<br>
the mobile phones in the world are being manufactured by<br>
technologically advanced countries such as England, the U.S.,<br>
Korea and Japan, there has not been any character inputting<br>
system dedicated for minority languages or some special Asian<br>
languages..<br>
For example, a Hindi language belonging to Indo-Iranian<br>
languages of an Indo-European family uses phonetic symbols<br>
called "Devanagari." Although input of the Devanagari<br>
characters has been achieved in local mobile phones using a<br>
method as shown in FIG. 1, the conventional method is so<br>
inefficient and inconvenient that Hindi language users are<br>
actually using English characters marked on key buttons.<br>
Thus, in other words, conventional keyboards of mobile<br>
phones or QWERTY-type keyboards have been used to input<br>
characters without consideration of literal characteristics of<br>
the Devanagari which is the notation of the Hindi language.<br>
For this reason, although the Hindi language occupies 40%<br>
of Indian population and 80% of Indian territorial area,<br>
inputting of the Hindi language has been not standardized but<br>
performed by inputting English characters instead in accordance<br><br>
with pronunciation of the Hindi language. Therefore, it takes a<br>
lot of time and efforts for a novice of the English keyboard to<br>
input English characters corresponding to the Hindi language.<br>
This has been a hindrance in popularization of mobile terminals<br>
in the Hindi region.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Therefore, the present invention has been made in view<br>
of the above problems, and it is an object of the present<br>
invention to provide a keypad array of a mobile phone for<br>
inputting a Hindi language, optimized for inputting Devanagari<br>
characters, which is the notation of Hindi, in a mobile phone<br>
and the like and structured to maximize convenience in use,<br>
considering the characteristics of the Devanagari characters,<br>
that is, phonetic symbols embodied by combination of vowels<br>
and consonants, such that difficulties in inputting characters<br>
of Hindi can be solved by applying the above keypad array in<br>
mobile phones designed for exportation to the Hindi region or<br>
directly in the Hindi region.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the above and<br>
other objects can be accomplished by the provision of a keypad<br>
array for inputting Devanagari characters which are phonetic<br>
symbols including vowels and consonants as the notation of a<br>
Hindi language, in mobile terminals such as a mobile phone,<br><br>
the keypad array comprising a vowel area allocated to key<br>
buttons of the keypad array, disposed at easily accessible<br>
positions for a user's manual operation, and marked with a<br>
main character and a sub character on each key button thereof,<br>
the main and sub characters selected in consideration of a<br>
Hindi dictionary order and frequency of use of the vowels; a<br>
semivowel area allocated to key buttons disposed adjacent to<br>
the vowel area; and a consonant area allocated to the other<br>
key buttons except the key buttons of the vowel and semivowel<br>
areas in such a manner that consonants are grouped according<br>
to oral places of articulation and articulation methods and<br>
two characters more frequently used than the others in each<br>
group are selected and marked as a main character and a sub<br>
character, such that all the Devanagari characters can be input<br>
by combined operation of the key buttons of the vowel,<br>
semivowel and consonant areas.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
keypad array for inputting the Devanagari characters in a<br>
mobile phone, comprising a vowel area allocated to key buttons<br>
of the keypad array, disposed at easily accessible positions<br>
for a user's manual operation, and marked with a main<br>
character and a sub character on each key button thereof, the<br>
main and sub characters selected in consideration of a Hindi<br>
dictionary order and frequency of use of the vowels; a<br>
semivowel area allocated to key buttons disposed adjacent to<br><br>
the vowel area; and a consonant area allocated to the other<br>
key buttons except the key buttons of the vowel and semivowel<br>
areas in such a manner that consonants are grouped based on<br>
morphological and geometrical similarity and two characters<br>
having highest frequency of use in each group are selected and<br>
marked as a main character and a sub character, such that all<br>
the Devanagari characters can be input by combined operation of<br>
the key buttons of the vowel, semivowel and consonant areas.<br>
Considering that the Devanagari characters of the Hind<br>
language are phonetic symbols using 11 vowels and 35<br>
consonants compositely, the present invention provides a<br>
keypad array capable of inputting the Devanagari characters in<br>
an independent and efficient way totally different from the<br>
conventional Devanagari character inputting system or the<br>
English character inputting system.<br>
Since the Hindi character inputting system is not yet<br>
standardized, the keypad array according to the present<br>
invention can be applied to goods for exportation to the Hindi<br>
region by providing the optimum efficiency, thereby enabling<br>
technological domination.<br>
Especially, the keypad array is really useful since<br>
providing such an efficient system for inputting Hindi used by<br>
40% of the whole Indian population and in 80% of the Indian<br>
territorial area.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Hereinafter, exemplary embodiments of the present<br>
invention will be described in detail with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>
FIG. 1 is a plan view showing the structure of a keypad<br>
for inputting Hindi in a mobile phone, according to a<br>
conventional art, and FIG. 2 is a plan view of a keypad having<br>
a keypad array for inputting Hindi in a mobile phone according<br>
to a first embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 3 is an<br>
explanatory view about vowels of Hindi for explaining the<br>
keypad array, FIG. 4 is an explanatory view about consonants<br>
of Hindi for explaining the keypad array, and FIG. 5 is an<br>
explanatory view about fricative consonants, nasal consonants,<br>
semivowels and lingual consonants of Hindi for explaining the<br>
keypad array. FIG. 6 is a plan view of a keypad having a<br>
keypad array for inputting Hindi in a mobile phone according<br>
to a second embodiment of the present invention, and FIG. 7 is<br><br>
a view explaining conversion among similarly shaped consonants<br>
of Devanagari characters of Hindi, in the keypad array for<br>
inputting Hindi in a mobile phone.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, in a conventional mobile phone M as<br>
a typical example of mobile terminals for inputting Hindi, a<br>
keypad K for inputting Hindi comprises general English<br>
alphabet characters and, additionally, Devanagari characters<br>
grouped and arranged on a plurality of key buttons B merely<br>
in the dictionary order of the Hindi characters with no<br>
consideration of the use frequency or the forms, in a<br><br>
This is the simplest way just for arranging the Hindi<br>
characters corresponding to a limited number of keypad buttons<br>
B, which has been generally applied in conventional mobile<br>
phones in recent days.<br>
However, with the key buttons B of the conventional<br>
keypad K, it is hard for a user to correctly remember how the<br>
Hindi characters are allocated to the respective key buttons<br>
B. Furthermore, because the groups of Hindi characters are<br>
arranged just in order of the button number, in order to input<br>
a desired one of the Hindi characters, the user has to first<br>
find out which key button B includes the character to be<br>
input, and check the arranged order of the desired character<br>
on the corresponding key button B. Next, the user has to<br><br>
repeatedly press the key button B until the desired character<br>
comes up.<br><br>
According to the conventional method as described above,<br>
not only that great caution and concentration of the user is<br>
required but also that it is inconvenient in that the same key<br>
button B should be pressed several times for certain<br>
characters; because each key button B includes many characters<br>
thereon.<br>
In consideration of the above inconvenience, a keypad<br>
array for inputting Hindi according to embodiments of the<br>
present invention is suggested as shown in FIG. 2 and FIG. 6.<br>
As far as not departing from the technical scope, various<br>
modifications as will be described in the following<br>
embodiments are acceptable.<br>
While briefly explaining the notation of the Hind<br>
language using the Devanagari characters with reference to<br>
FIG. 3 to FIG. 5, a first embodiment of the keypad array will<br>
be described with FIG. 2 and a second embodiment with FIG. 6.<br><br>
[Devanagari characters and the notation]<br>
The "Devanagari" characters for expressing the Hind<br>
language are phonetic symbols comprising 11 vowels and 35<br>
consonants.<br>
More particularly, as shown in FIG. 3, the 11 vowels<br>
comprise cardinal vowels a (1), i (3), u (5), e (8) and o (10),<br>
long vowels a (2), i (4), u (6), ai (9) and au (11), and a<br>
semivowel ri (7).<br>
As shown in FIG. 4, the 35 consonants can be classified<br>
according to places of articulation in the oral cavity as<br>
follows:<br>
Velar sounds - voiceless sounds k (20) and kh (21), and<br>
voiced sounds g (22) and gh (23)<br>
Palatal sounds - voiceless sounds c (30) and ch (31),<br>
and voiced sounds j (32) and jh (33)<br>
Retroflex sounds - voiceless sounds t (40) and th (41),<br>
and voiced sounds d (42) and dh (43)<br>
Alveolar sounds - voiceless sounds t (50) and th (51) ,<br>
and voiced sounds d (52) and dh (53), and<br>
Bilabial sounds - voiceless sounds p (60) and ph (61),<br>
and voiced sounds b (62) and bh (63)<br>
In addition, as shown in FIG. 5, the consonants include<br>
the following sounds classified according to methods of<br>
articulation:<br>
Fricative sounds - S (70), S (71), S (72) and h (73), and<br><br>
Nasal sounds - h (80), n (81), n (82), n (83) and m (84)<br>
Besides, there are semivowels y (90) and w (93), the<br>
semivowels having a phonetic value of a vowel but having a<br>
consonant form, a trill sound r (91), and a lateral sound 1<br>
(92) . The trill sound r (91) is similar to an R-sound and the<br>
lateral sound 1 (92) is similar to an L-sound of English.<br>
In addition, the consonant include flap sounds R (100)<br>
and Rh (101) which are similar to the R-sound of English.<br>
The pronunciations of the consonants gh (23), jh (33), dh<br>
(43) , dh (53) and bh (63) cannot be expressed in Korean. Also,<br>
the voiceless sounds t (40) and th (41) of the retroflex sounds<br>
and the voiceless sounds t (50) and th (51) of the alveolar<br>
sounds, each having similar pronunciations but different<br>
articulation methods, cannot be discriminatively expressed in<br>
Korean.<br>
[Embodiment 1]<br>
FIG. 2 shows a keypad array Kl for inputting Hindi, being<br>
implemented on the respective key buttons of a keypad of a<br>
general mobile phone M, according to the first embodiment of<br>
the present invention.<br>
The first embodiment aims at easier awareness of the<br>
arrangement of characters and more convenient use for the user,<br>
by arranging the Hindi characters in consideration of phonetic<br>
dynamics, especially relative positions in the oral cavity.<br><br>
In the keypad array Kl of the mobile phone M, first of<br>
all, positions most accessible by a user's right thumb, that<br>
is, upper through lower numeric key buttons B on the right line<br>
of the keypad array Kl are defined as a vowel area VA.<br>
The vowel area VA may surely be allocated at other<br>
various positions, for example, the left vertical line or an<br>
upper transverse line of the keypad array Kl. However,<br>
considering combined use of the vowels and the consonants, it<br>
is most preferred that the vowel area VA is disposed for<br>
convenient access of the right thumb which is most frequently<br>
used by a right-handed user.<br>
As shown in FIG. 2, the key buttons B corresponding to<br>
the vowel area VA each comprise a group including the a (2) as<br>
a main character and the i (4) as a sub character, a group<br>
including the u (5) as a main character and the ri (7) as a sub<br>
character, and a group including the e (8) as a main character<br>
and the o (10) as a sub character. Here, allocation of the<br>
vowel characters to the respectively key buttons B is performed<br>
based on the Hindi dictionary order and the frequency of use.<br>
Since the long vowel a (2) has a much higher use frequency than<br>
the short vowel a (1) and the long vowel i (4) a much higher<br>
use frequency than the short vowel i (3), the short vowels a<br>
(1) and i (3) have priority to the long vowels a (2) and i (4)<br>
according to the dictionary order. However, exceptionally, the<br>
long vowels a (2) and i (4) are allocated as main and sub<br><br>
characters in the key button B.<br>
According to this, the vowels i (4), ri (7) and o (10)<br>
allocated as the sub characters on the keypad array Kl can be<br>
input by pressing the corresponding key buttons B twice,<br>
respectively.<br>
In addition, by using a shift key S of the keypad array<br>
Kl, the vowels selected as the main character on each key<br>
button B of the vowel area VA can be converted to the short<br>
vowel a (1) and i (3), the long vowel u(6), and the long vowels<br>
ai(9) and au(ll), respectively.<br>
A semivowel area SVA is formed adjacent to the vowel area<br>
VA, for example, on a numeric key 8 disposed on the left of the<br>
vowel area VA as shown in the drawing. The semivowel area SVA<br>
includes the semivowels y (90) and w (93), the trill sound r<br>
(91), and the lateral sound 1 (92).<br>
In the semivowel area SVA, the r (91) and the 1 (92),<br>
having higher frequency of use than the y (90) and w (93) , are<br>
grouped as a main character and a sub character and can be<br>
converted respectively to the y (90) and w (93) by using the<br>
shift key S.<br>
A left area of the keypad array Kl is defined as a<br>
consonant area CA. The consonants are grouped into velar,<br>
palatal, retroflex, alveolar and bilabial sounds according to<br>
the places of articulation and allocated to the key buttons B<br>
of the consonant area CA according to the group. In each<br><br>
consonant group, two characters more frequently used than the<br>
others are selected as a main character and a sub character and<br>
marked on the corresponding key button B. The other consonant<br>
characters but the main and the sub characters can be input by<br>
operation of the shift key S. The consonants selected as the<br>
main and sub characters can be regarded as representative<br>
voiceless and voiced sounds of each group.<br>
In addition, the fricative, nasal, semivowels and lingual<br>
sounds, being grouped based on the articulation methods, are<br>
allocated to other key buttons B according to the group. In<br>
each group, two characters of high frequency of use are<br>
selected as a main character and a sub character and marked on<br>
the corresponding key button B. The other consonant characters<br>
but the main and sub characters can be input by operation of<br>
the shift key S.<br>
As described above, according to the first embodiment,<br>
the vowels are arranged on the keypad array Kl by being grouped<br>
based on the dictionary order and the frequency of use while<br>
the consonants are grouped and arranged based on the places in<br>
the oral cavity and methods of articulation, and frequency of<br>
use. In other words, the grouping principle is based on the<br>
phonetic system which is familiar to the user.<br>
Furthermore, there are some functional marks used<br>
together with the Devanagari characters, the marks including a<br>
bottom dot for expressing naturalized words, Chandrabindu and<br><br>
bindu for expressing nasal vowels, and other main marks. Those<br>
marks are written below, above or next to the characters by<br>
operating corresponding key buttons B, for example, by pressing<br>
the key button B three times or pressing the key button B once<br>
or twice for a long time. In addition, semi-consonants used to<br>
make double consonants may also be allocated to the key buttons<br>
B of the consonant area CA and input by operating the<br>
corresponding key buttons B, for example, by pressing the key<br>
button B once for a long time.<br>
The notation of the Devanagari characters is sometimes<br>
changed when the consonants and vowels are combined in<br>
consonant-vowel, vowel-consonant, consonant-vowel-consonant<br>
structures. However, such exceptional cases would be properly<br>
processed by software and displayed on a screen of the mobile<br>
phone M.<br>
[Embodiment 2]<br>
FIG. 6 shows a keypad array K2 for inputting Hindi, being<br>
implemented on the respective key buttons of a keypad of a<br>
general mobile phone M, according to the second embodiment of<br>
the present invention.<br>
According to the second embodiment, the Devanagari<br>
characters are grouped and arranged in consideration of design<br>
and morphology, aiming at convenience for a user who is well<br>
acquainted with Hindi conceptionally and visually.<br><br>
As can be understood from the above explanation, there is<br>
a poor association between the pronunciation and the visual<br>
form of the Devanagari characters.<br>
For example, although the voiceless sounds t (50) and th<br>
(51) of the alveolar sound have similar pronunciations and<br>
articulation places to each other, the Devanagari characters<br>
corresponding to the t (50) and the th (51) do not have any<br>
similarity. Instead, the Devanagari character of the t (50) has<br>
a similar form to that of the n (83) while the Devanagari<br>
character of the th (51) has a similar for to that of the S<br>
(70).<br>
Therefore, the Devanagari characters may be grouped into<br>
characters having similar forms in view of the usage and the<br>
user's association.<br>
According to this, a main character of each group is<br>
marked on the keypad K2 so as to be input by pressing of the<br>
corresponding key button B, and the other characters of the<br>
group can be input using the shift key S. Here, the main<br>
characters and the sub characters may be changed depending on<br>
the frequency of use.<br>
FIG. 6 shows the mobile phone M equipped with the keypad<br>
array K2 applying the morphological reference.<br>
In the same manner as in the first embodiment, in the<br>
keypad array K2 of the mobile phone M, a vowel area VA is<br>
disposed on upper through lower right numeric key buttons B,<br><br>
and each of the key buttons B of the vowel area VA comprises a<br>
group including Devanagari characters of a (2) and 1 (4), a<br>
group including Devanagari characters of u (5) and ri (7), and<br>
a group including Devanagari characters of e (8) and o (10) .<br>
Also, main characters of the respective groups are selected<br>
considering the Hindi dictionary order and the use frequency,<br>
which is the same manner as in the first embodiment. However,<br>
this embodiment does not dedicatedly define a semivowel area<br>
SVA of the first embodiment.<br>
On the other hand, when arranging the consonants, the<br>
Devanagari characters are grouped by similar forms and arranged<br>
on the key buttons B of a consonant area CA by the groups as<br>
shown in FIG. 6. In addition, main characters and sub<br>
characters are selected in consideration of the use frequency.<br>
The other characters in the same group, similar to the main<br>
character, can be input by using the shift key S. Especially,<br>
the main characters are arranged according to the dictionary<br>
order so that the user can easily get familiar with the<br>
arrangement.<br>
Referring to FIG. 6 and FIG. 7, the consonants are<br>
allocated to the consonant area CA of the keypad array K2 in<br>
such a manner that the key buttons B on the consonant area CA<br>
each shows the characters of k (20)-w (93), j (32)-ch (31), t<br>
(40)- th (41), n (83)-g (22), p (60)-y (90), r (91)-1 (92), and<br>
m (84)-th (51) as a main character and sub character pair of<br><br>
the corresponding group.<br>
When the shift key S is pressed together with the<br>
respective key buttons B for inputting the characters of k<br>
(20), w (93), j (32), ch (31), t (40), th (41), n (83), g (22),<br>
p (60), y (90), r (91), 1 (92), m (84) and th (51), a most<br>
similar character to each of the above characters is input.<br>
More specifically, when the Devanagari characters<br>
corresponding to the k (20) is converted by the shift key S,<br>
the Devanagari character of the kh (21), having the most<br>
similar form with the Devanagari character of the k (21) is<br>
input.<br>
In the same manner, when the character of the w (21) is<br>
converted by the shift key S, the Devanagari character of the b<br>
(62) having the most similar form is input.<br>
When the character of the j (32) is converted by the<br>
shift key S, the Devanagari character of the c (30) having the<br>
most similar form is input.<br>
When the character of the ch (31) is converted by the<br>
shift key S, the Devanagari character of the gh (23) having the<br>
most similar form is input. By twice consecutive operations of<br>
the shift key S, the Devanagari character of the dh (53) having<br>
another similar form to the Devanagari character of the ch (31)<br>
is input.<br>
When the character of the t (40) is converted by the shift<br>
key S, the Devanagari character of the d (52) having the most<br><br>
similar form is input.<br>
When the character of the th (41) is converted by the<br>
shift key S, the Devanagari character of the dh (43) having the<br>
most similar form is input. By twice consecutive operations of<br>
the shift key S, the Devanagari character of the Rh (101)<br>
having another similar form is input.<br>
When the character of the n (83) is converted by the<br>
shift key S, the Devanagari character of the t (50) having the<br>
most similar form is input.<br>
When the character of the g (22) is converted by the<br>
shift key S, the Devanagari character of the n (82) having the<br>
most similar form is input.<br>
When the character of the p (60) is converted by the<br>
shift key S, the Devanagari character of the ph (61) having the<br>
most similar form is input. By twice consecutive operations of<br>
the shift key S, the Devanagari character of the S (71) having<br>
another similar form is input.<br>
When the character of the y (90) is converted by the<br>
shift key S, there is no designated consonant to be converted<br>
to.<br>
When the character of the r (91) is converted by the<br>
shift key S, the Devanagari character of the S (72) having the<br>
most similar form is input.<br>
When the character of the 1 (92) is converted by the<br>
shift key S, the Devanagari character of the n (81) having the<br><br>
most similar form is input.<br>
When the character of the h (73) is converted by the<br>
shift key S, the Devanagari character of the jh (33) having the<br>
most similar form is input.<br>
When the character of the R (100) is converted by the<br>
shift key S, the Devanagari character of the d (42) having the<br>
most similar form is input. By twice consecutive operations of<br>
the shift key S, the Devanagari character of the n (80) having<br>
another similar form is input.<br>
When the character of the m (84) is converted by the<br>
shift key S, the Devanagari character of the bh (63) having the<br>
most similar form is input.<br>
When the character of the th (51) is converted by the<br>
shift key S, the Devanagari character of the S (70) having the<br>
most similar form is input. By thus allocating the Devanagari<br>
characters so that each group includes morphologically similar<br>
characters, long-term Hindi users who can easily associate the<br>
characters with the language are able to more conveniently<br>
input the Hindi characters with the mobile phone M.<br>
As can be appreciated from the above description, the<br>
present invention provides a keypad array for inputting Hindi<br>
in a mobile phone and so on, enabling a user, who is familiar<br>
with the Devanagari characters more than the conventional<br>
English conversion system, to conveniently input the Devanagari<br>
characters by easily getting acquainted with the key<br><br>
arrangement through association and the usage. Accordingly, the<br>
number of key inputting operations can be minimized while<br>
improving the convenience of use. That is, the efficiency in<br>
inputting the characters can be greatly improved.<br>
