As used herein, the term "subject" shall refer to an<br>
animal, preferably a mammal, more preferably a human, who<br>
is the object of treatment, observation of experiment.<br>
As used herein, the term "therapeutically effective<br>
amount", means that amount of active compound or<br>
pharmaceutical agent that elicits the biological or<br>
medicinal response in a tissue system, animal or human that<br>
is being sought by a researcher, veterinarian, medical<br>
doctor or other clinician, which includes alleviation of<br>
the symptoms of the disease or disorder being treated.<br>
The salts of the instant invention may be administered<br>
to a subject in need thereof at any dosage level such that<br>
the amount is therapeutically effective. Optimal dosages<br>
to be administered may be readily determined by those<br>
skilled in the art, and will vary with the particular salt<br>
used, the mode of administration, the strength of the<br>
preparation, and the advancement of the disease condition.<br>
In addition, factors associated with the particular<br>
patient being treated, including patient age, weight, diet<br>

parenteral method including, but not limited to, via oral,<br>
pulmonary, intraperitoneal (ip), intramuscular (im) ,<br>
intravenous (iv), subcutaneous (sc), transdermal, buccal,<br>
nasal, sublingual, ocular, rectal and vaginal routes of<br>
administration. The salts of the compound of formula (I)<br>
may also be administered directly to the nervous system<br>
via intracerebral, intraventricular,<br>
intracerebroventricular, intrathecal, intracisternal,<br>
intraspinal and / or peri-spinal routes of administration,<br>
with or without pump devices. It will be readily apparent<br>
to those skilled in the art that any dose or frequency of<br>
administration that provides the desired therapeutic<br>
effect is suitable for use in the instant invention.<br>
To prepare the pharmaceutical compositions of the<br>
present invention, one or more of the salts described<br>
herein are intimately admixed with a pharmaceutical<br>
carrier according to conventional techniques, which<br>
carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the<br>
form of preparation desired for administration, e.g.,<br>
oral, by suppository or parenteral. In preparing the<br>
compositions in oral dosage form, any of the usual<br>
pharmaceutical media may be employed. Thus, for liquid<br>
oral preparations, such as, for example, suspensions,<br>
elixers and solutions, suitable carriers and additives<br>
include water, glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents,<br>
preservative, coloring agents and the like; for solid oral<br>
preparations such as, for example, powders, capsules and<br>
tablets, suitable carriers and additives include starches,<br>
sugars, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders,<br>
disintegrating agents and the like. Because of their ease<br>
of administration, tablets and capsules represent the most<br>
advantageous oral dosage unit form, in which case solid<br>
pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. If<br>
desired, tablets may be sugar coated or enteric coated by<br>
standard techniques. Suppositories may be prepared, in<br>
which cocoa butter could be used as a carrier. For<br>
parenterals, the carrier will usually comprise sterile<br>
water, though other ingredients, for example, for purposes<br>
such as aiding solubility or for preservation, may be<br>
included. Injectable suspensions may also be prepared in<br>
which case, appropriate liquid carriers, suspending agents<br>
and the like may be employed.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions herein will contain,<br>
per dosage unit, e.g., tablet, capsule, powder, injection,<br>
teaspoonful, suppository and the like, from about 10 to<br>
about 500 mg of active ingredient.<br>
The following examples describe the invention in<br>
greater detail and are intended to illustrate the<br>
invention, but not to limit it.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Potassium Salt - Form K2<br>
Topiramate (853.6 mg) was dissolved in THF (2.5 mL).<br>
The solution was chilled in an ice bath. To the solution<br>
was then added 1M potassium butoxide in THF (2.5 mL)<br>
dropwise. The solution was stirred for 30 min. A<br>
precipitate was formed. The precipitate was filtered and<br>
placed in a vacuum oven at 34Â°C, to yield the potassium<br>
salt as Form K2, as a solid.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Potassium Salt â€” Form K2<br>
Topiramate (1.0007 g, 2.95 mmol) was dissolved in<br>
diethyl ether (20 mL). The solution was chilled in an<br>
ice water bath under N2. 1M potassium tert-butoxide in THF<br>
(2.95 mL, 2.95 mmol) was the added dropwise to the<br>
solution. The solution was stirred for 30 min and a<br>
precipitate was formed. The precipitate was filtered<br>
under N2, washed with additional diethyl ether and dried<br>
in a vacuum oven at ambient temperature to yield the<br>
potassium salt product as Form K2, as a white solid.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
Potassium Salt - Form K3<br>
Topiramate (0.7512 g) was dissolved in toluene (15<br>
mL). Potassium hydroxide (0.1440 g) was added and the<br>
solution was stirred at 360 rpm. A Dean Stark trap was<br>
attached and the hot plate temperature increased until the<br>
toluene was a rapid reflux (at about 185Â°C). The solution<br>
was maintained at reflux for 24 hours. The solution was<br>
allowed to cool slowly, then filtered. The remaining<br>
solvent was removed by roto-evaporation in a water bath<br>
set at 30Â°C. Solids remaining in the flask were dissolved<br>
in ethyl acetate (2 mL) . To the solution was then added<br>
hexanes (15 mL), resulting in the formation of a<br>
precipitate. The precipitate was collected by vacuum<br>
filtration and washed with diethyl ether (30 mL) , to yield<br>
the potassium salt as Form K3, as a solid. The solid was<br>
stored over P2O5.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
Sodium Salt â€” Form Na1<br>
Sodium hydride (71.1 mg) (60% dispersion in mineral<br>
oil) was rinsed 3 times with pentane and dried under N2 for<br>
30 min. A solution of topiramate (500 mg) dissolved in<br>
THF (3 mL) was added dropwise. An additional solution of<br>
topiramate (103 mg) in THF (2 mL) was then added. The<br>
solution was stirred in an ice water bath under N2<br>
overnight. To the solution was added hexane (4 mL) and<br>
the solution was again stirred overnight, resulting in the<br>
formation of a cloudy precipitate. The solution was<br>
placed in a refrigerator and then into a freezer<br>
overnight. The solution was removed from the freezer and<br>
then stirred at ambient temperature for about 3 hours.<br>
The resulting precipitate was collected by vacuum<br>
filtration and air dried to yield the sodium salt as Form<br>
Na1, as a solid.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
Sodium Salt - Form Na3<br>
Sodium hydride (0.1076 g) (60% dispersion in mineral<br>
oil) was rinsed with hexanes (30 mL) under N2. The upper<br>
layer of the solution was removed with a dry pipette. The<br>
remaining hexanes were evaporated by fast evaporation<br>
under N2 for about 1 hour. THF (2 mL) was then added to<br>
the sodium hydride slurry and the resulting slurry was<br>
cooled in an ice water bath. A solution of topiramate<br>
(853.8 mg) in THF (2.5 mL) was added dropwise to the cold<br>
sodium hydride slurry. Hexanes (25 mL) were then added to<br>
the mixture, resulting in the formation of a precipitate.<br>
The precipitate was vacuum filtered, washed with<br>
additional hexanes and then placed in a vacuum oven at 34Â°C<br>
for about 1 hr.<br>
The resulting solid was mixed with diethyl ether (40<br>
mL) and sonicated. The solution was vacuum filtered and<br>
the precipitate dried in a vacuum oven at 34Â°C, to yield<br>
the sodium salt as Form Na3, as a solid.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
Sodium Salt â€” Form Na4<br>
Sodium hydride (507 mg) was rinsed 4 times with<br>
pentane (10 mL) and then allowed to dry under a N2 stream.<br>
A solution of topiramate (3.5 g) in THF (10 mL) was then<br>
added to the sodium hydride and stirred at room<br>
temperature. The solution was cooled in a dry<br>
ice/isopropyl alcohol bath and then allowed to warm to<br>
room temperature. The solution was filtered through an<br>
0.2m nylon filter. The solution was then allowed to stand<br>
under N2 stream overnight, to slowly evaporate the solvent.<br>
To the residue were added hexanes (15 mL). The resulting<br>
mixture was sonicated and the vessel sides scratched to<br>
induce precipitation of product. THF (1.5 mL) was added<br>
and the slurry stirred at ambient temperature, and let<br>
stand under N2 for 2 days. The resulting precipitate was<br>
collected by vacuum filtration, rinsed 3 times with<br>
hexanes (5 mL) and placed for 6 hours in a vacuum oven at<br>
ambient temperature, to yield the sodium salt as Form Na4,<br>
as a solid. The sold was lightly ground with agate mortal<br>
and pestle prior to testing.<br>
EXAMPLE 7<br>

Topiramate (3.4 g, 10 mmol) was dissolved in THF (40<br>
mL) at room temperature, then treated with 50% aq NaOH<br>
(0.8g, 10 mmol). At the end of addition, a clear solution<br>
was formed. The THF was evaporated under reduced pressure<br>
and the oily residue placed under vacuum to remove any<br>
remaining solvent or water. The product formed as a white<br>
foam, an amorphous solid. XRD-analysis confirmed that the<br>
product was amorphous.<br>

the mixture was stirred at room temp. The ethanol was<br>
evaporated, the residue dissolved in t-butyl methyl ether<br>
(100 mL) and treated with H2O (~ 0.4g), resulting in the<br>
formation of a crystalline solid. The solid was collected<br>
by filtration and air-dried (3.9g in two crops). The<br>
solid was suspended in ethyl acetate (3 0 mL) and heated,<br>
just enough to dissolve the solid without loosing any<br>
water. The solution was filtered quickly through a small<br>
cotton plug and allowed to stand at room temperature. The<br>
product crystallized out over about 20 min. The solid was<br>

was reduced to 300 mL). The solution was allowed to stand<br>
at room temperature for about 1h, a hard white solid<br>
precipitated and was broken down before filtration. The<br>
solid was rinsed with ethyl acetate and air-dried, to<br>
yield K2 as a solid. The solid initially behaved as a<br>
hygroscopic material (became sticky) before it was air-<br>
dried; after drying there were no hygroscopic properties.<br>
Karl-Fischer % wt water: 1.09%<br>
EXAMPLE 15<br>
Preparation of Potassium Salt Form K3<br>
Potassium hydroxide (85%, 13.2 g, 200 mmol) was<br>
dissolved in water (25 mL) and added at room temperature<br>
to a solution of topiramate (68.6 g, 202 mmol) in THF (500<br>
mL), then stirred at room temperature for 10 min. The<br>
solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure to yield a<br>
foamy solid (80.9 g) . XRD analysis confirmed the solid<br>
was amorphous.<br>
EXAMPLE 16<br>
Preparation of Lithium Salt Form Li1<br>
n-Butyl lithium (10 mL of 2M solution in cyclohexane,<br>
20 mmol) was added slowly to a solution of topiramate<br>
(7.0 g, 20.6 mmol) in THF (50 mL) at about 25-35Â°C. The<br>
solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure to yield a<br>
foamy, light yellow, amorphous solid. XRD analysis<br>
confirmed the solid was amorphous.<br>
EXAMPLE 17<br>
Preparation of Magnesium Salt Form Mg1<br>
Magnesium turnings (0.24g 10 matm) in methanol (100<br>
mL) were heated on a steam bath until the Mg dissolved.<br>
Topiramate (6.78g, 20 mmol) was added to the Mg-methoxide<br>
solution and heated on a steam bath for about 5 min, then<br>
cooled to room temperature. Any contact with water was<br>
avoided. The solvent was evaporated under reduced<br>
pressure and the residue further dried under vacuum at<br>
room temperature to a constant weight, to yield the<br>
product as a white foamy amorphous solid. XRD analysis<br>
confirmed the solid was amorphous.<br>
EXAMPLE 18<br>
Preparation of Sodium Salt Form Na1.<br>
Topiramate (50 g, 0.147 mol) was dissolved in<br>
isopropyl acetate (600 mL) and treated with 30% NaOCH3 in<br>
methanol (28.5 mL). The light yellow solution was heated<br>
at reflux to distill some of the solvent (an azeotrope of<br>
methanol/isopropyl acetate, 70.2/29.8, bp. 64Â°C) till the<br>
temperature in the flask was observed to reach 85Â°C. The<br>
reaction mixture was then cooled to about 20-25Â°C. The<br>
reaction mixture was filtered through Celite (to remove<br>
any insoluble residue) and rinsed with isopropyl acetate<br>
(60 mL) . The solution was then heated to 50Â°C. To the<br>
solution was added water (7.9 ml) over 1 min. The product<br>
was allowed to crystallize at about 20-25Â°C overnight.<br>
The solid was collected by filtration, washed with<br>
isopropyl acetate (50 ml) and dried in a vacuum oven<br>
containing a bowl of water at 3 0Â°C for 24h.<br>
Water (wt% by KF): 13%.<br>
EXAMPLE 19<br>
Preparation of Sodium Salt Form Na1<br>
Topiramate (50g, 0.147 mol) was dissolved in<br>
isopropyl acetate (367 ml) (2.5L/mol). Sodium methoxide<br>
30% in methanol (27.2 ml, leq.) was added at room<br>
temperature. The mixture was stirred over 10 min and then<br>
filtered at about 22-25Â°C. The filtrate was then heated<br>
to 35Â°C. Water (8 ml, 3 eg.) was then added and the<br>
crystallization began after seeding. The mixture was<br>
cooled down to about 22-25Â°C over 30 min, then further<br>
cooled down with ice-water to about 0-5Â°C. The<br>
precipitate was filtered off, washed with isopropyl<br>
acetate (50 ml) (0.35L/mol) and dried at 35Â°C under vacuum<br>
during 18h.<br>
EXAMPLE 20<br>
Recrystallizatiorx of Potassium Salt Form K1 <br><br>
Solid potassium salt of topiramate (66 g; a mixture<br>
of two polymorphic forms K2 and K3) was suspended in<br>
ethanol (250 mL) and the mixture was heated to boiling<br>
until all of the solid dissolved. The hot solution was<br>
filtered through Celite and the mixture was diluted to a<br>
final volume of 360 mL with additional ethanol. The clear<br>
solution was seeded, while hot, with a few crystals of<br>
Form K1 solid and allowed to stand at room temperature<br>
without external cooling. As the solution started to<br>
cool, the solid product crystallized out slowly. The<br>
crystallization flask was kept in a refrigerator overnight<br>
and the cold mixture was filtered to isolate the solid<br>
product. The crystalline solid was rinsed with cold<br>
ethanol, then with diethyl ether and then air-dried.<br>
The filtrate was concentrated to about 150 mL and<br>
allowed to stand at room temperature for 2 days. The<br>
resulting solid was collected by filtration, rinsed with<br>
cold ethanol and then air-dried. XRD-pattern showed Form<br>
K1.<br>
EXAMPLE 21<br>
Preparation of Potassium Salt Form, K1<br>
Topiramate (163.8g, 483 mmol) was suspended in<br>
ethanol (500 mL). To the mixture was then added potassium<br>
ethoxide in ethanol (24%, 168 g, 479 mmol) . Nearly all<br>
the topiramate dissolved by the end of addition (total<br>
volume -750 mL). The initial crystallization resulted in<br>
a paste-like solid. The mixture was heated gently on a<br>
steam bath until it became fluid. Heating was then<br>
continued on a hot plate with stirring until all of the<br>
solid had dissolved. The hot solution was filtered<br>
through Celite and rinsed with hot ethanol (50 mL) . The<br>
solution was again heated to boiling to form a clear<br>
solution. The solution was seeded with Form K1 crystals<br>
while hot, then allowed to stand at room temperature<br>
overnight. The flask was cooled in an ice bath for 2h and<br>
the solid was collected by filtration. The solid was<br>
rinsed with cold ethanol (100 mL) , then with diethyl<br>
ether, and then air-dried. The solid was further dried in<br>
a vacuum oven at about 40-50Â°C overnight. The XRD pattern<br>
showed Form K1.<br>
Water (wt% by KF) : 0.14%<br>
The filtrate was concentrated to about 200 mL. The<br>
solution was allowed to stand at room temperature to yield<br>
a second crop of Form K1.<br>
EXAMPLE 22<br>
Anticonvulsant activity was determined using the MES<br>
test as described by Swinyard EA, Woodhead JH, White HSf<br>
Franklin MR. Experimental selection, quantification, and<br>
evaluation of anticonvulsants. In Levy RH, et al., eds.<br>
Antiepileptic Drugs. 3rd ed. New York: Raven Press,<br>
1989:85-102.<br>
In this procedure, a 60-Hz alternating current (mice<br>
50 mA, rats 150 mA) was delivered for 0.2 sec through<br>
corneal electrodes by an apparatus that is capable of<br>
precisely regulating current intensity and duration. The<br>
concave side of the electrode (2mm diameter for mice;<br>
4.0mm diameter for rats) was placed on each cornea. The<br>
current reliably produces, in all rodents, a single<br>
convulsive episode that includes, as a component, hind<br>
limb tonic extension. Immediately before placement of<br>
corneal electrodes, a drop of saline (an electrolyte that<br>
promotes the dispersion of the current and that reduces<br>
lethalities) was placed on each electrode. Rodents were<br>
restrained by hand during this procedure and released<br>
immediately after stimulation to permit observation of the<br>
convulsion throughout its entire course.<br>
The test compound or corresponding vehicle was<br>
administered to overnight fasted rodents by the oral<br>
(gavage) route of administration. (Test compound or<br>
vehicle may alternatively be administered via<br>
intraperitoneal, intravenous, subcutaneous or<br>
intramuscular route of administration.) Subsequently,<br>
electrical stimulation was administered to the rodents at<br>
a time corresponding to the suspected time of peak<br>
activity of the test compound. The test was complete when<br>
the entire course of the convulsion had been observed<br>
(typically, less than 1 minute after electrical<br>
stimulation), and rodents were then immediately euthanized<br>
by carbon dioxide inhalation.<br>
Abolition of the hind-limb tonic extensor component<br>
of the seizure was taken as the endpoint for this test.<br>
Absence of this component indicated that the test compound<br>
has the ability to prevent the spread of seizure discharge<br>
through neural tissue. The ED50 value of the test compound<br>
was the calculated dose required to block the hind limb<br>
tonic-extensor component of the MES-induced seizure in 50%<br>
of the rodents tested.<br>
Form K1 of the potassium salt of topiramate (the<br>
compound of formula (Ia)) was tested in rats according to<br>
the above procedure, dosing orally. Calculated ED50 value<br>
was determined in two separate measurements as 3.1mg/kg<br>
and 8.1 mg/kg at 2 hours post dosing.<br>
Form K1 of the potassium salt of topiramate (the<br>
compound of formula (Ia)) was tested in mice according to<br>
the above procedure, dosing orally and IP with calculated<br>
ED50 results as follows:<br>
Dosing orally ED50 @ 2 hrs = 40.6 mg/kg<br>
Dosing IP ED50 @ 2 hrs = 26.8 mg/kg<br>
Dosing IV ED50 @ 5 mins = 41.51 mg/kg<br>
Form Na1 of the sodium salt of topiramate (the<br>
compound of formula (Ia)) was tested in rats according to<br>
the above procedure, dosing orally. Calculated ED50 value<br>
was determined in as 4.8 mg/kg at 2 hours post dosing.<br>
Form Na1 of the sodium salt of topiramate (the<br>
compound of formula (Ia)) was tested in mice according to<br>
the above procedure, dosing IP with calculated ED50 results<br>
as follows:<br>
Dosing IP ED50 @ 30 mins = 45.44 mg/kg<br>
Dosing IV ED50 @ 5 mins = 46.18 mg/kg<br>
