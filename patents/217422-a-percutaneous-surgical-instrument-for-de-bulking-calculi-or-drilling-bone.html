The present invention is generally directed to a surgical<br>
instrument  for  disintegrating  and  de-bulking  calculi  or<br>
5  drilling atone, or bone and is more particularly directed to<br>
percutaneous  surgical  instruments  for  use  in  urological<br>
lithotripsy.<br>
Many people develop calculi within their common bile;<br>
10  urinary, renal,  or urethral systems.  Such calculi may block;<br>
ducts and/or cause great pain and therefore must be removed.<br>
Originally,  open  surgery  has  been  performed  wherein<br>
multiple  incisions  are  made  to  approach  and  remove  the<br>
15  calculi.  However, this treatment results in a relatively long<br>
recovery period and has long fallen into disfavor.<br>
Presently, such calculi are destroyed in situ after which<br>
the fragmented calculi can be naturally evacuated. Various<br>
20 methods of de-bulking such calculi are known in the art.<br>
Instruments currently in use are typically ultrasonic fixed<br>
probe devices or pneumatic impacting probes that operate at<br>
fixed low frequencies.<br>
25 Fixed ultrasonic probe devices that operate in the low<br>
20-30 kHz range are best in disintegrating the small stones<br>
and pneumatic impact probes that deliver very high energy but<br>
at lower frequencies of 5-20 impacts per second.<br>

WO 2O04/060141                                                                                     PCT/US2003/039218<br>
2928<br>
Another technique uses extra- eorporeal shock waves for<br>
de-bulking calculi. In this instance, a patient is subjected<br>
to shock waves with the shock waves passing through a<br>
patient's skin which causes bruising and is not acceptable for<br>
5 pregnant women and is slow requiring multiple procedures for<br>
large stones. However, there are calculi, which cannot be<br>
removed by this technique because of the location, volume or<br>
composition, or health of patient.<br>
10 The present invention is directed to a dual probe<br>
instrument that combines the higher 20 kHz or more frequency<br>
and the high energy shock impacting of the low, for example,<br>
less than 1 kHs, frequencies. With the use of concentric<br>
probes,  a  lumen  may  be  established  therethrough  allowing<br>
15  suction to remove calculi, or stone, debris from a patient.<br>

A generator may be provided for driving the actuator at<br>
desired. frequencies, pulse cycles and duty cycles in order to<br>
10  both change the ultrasonic frequency introduced by the fixed<br>
probe and the oscillations of the low frequency impacts.<br>
In  addition,  the  fixed  probe  may  include  a  lumen<br>
therethrough for aspiration of disintegrated calculi or bone<br>
15  with the fix probe lumen in communication with a lumen through<br>
the horn.<br>

20   DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
With reference to Figures 1-4c there is shown a<br>
percutaneous surgical instrument 10 for de-bulking calculi or<br>
dilling/coring bone generally including an actuator 12 for<br>
25 generating vibrations at ultrasonic frequencies which may be.<br>
formed from a plurality of piezoelectric crystals or<br>
magnetostrictive asssmbly 16 and a back plate 18,<br><br>
5<br><br>
WO 2O04/060141                                                                                     PCT/US2003/039218<br>
2928<br>
Additionally, a transducer assembly 15 may be configured<br>
reduce the capacitive effect of piezo crystals in an insulated<br>
stack. This may have an interference affect on other<br>
sensitive electrical instruments being operated close by.<br>
5 This is overcome with the placement of insulators 20 at each<br>
end and one in the center of the poled crystals is to create<br>
opposite polarity.<br>
A horn 22  is coupled to the  actuator  12  through an<br>
10  abutment 26 and a proximal end 28 of the horn 22.    This<br>
arrangement provides for amplification of the actuator 12<br>
vibration,<br>
A fixed probe is attached to a distal end 36 of the horn<br>
15  22 through a fitting 38 for receiving ultrasonic frequencies<br>
and  engaging  a  calculi,  net  shown,  for  introducing  the<br>
ultrasonic frequencies thereto.<br>
As  hereinabove  noted,  the  fixed probe  and  actuator<br>
20  operate generally in the 18 kMz frequencies or above for<br>
disintegrating small stones, or calculi.<br>
A floating  probe 44  is  disposed  concentric  to  and<br>
over/under the fixed probe 32 and is slidable over the fixed<br>
25  probe.<br>
A fixed and floating probe that may be coated with, a<br>
lubricating element such as Teflon or a hydrophilic coating.<br><br>

WO 2O04/060141                                                                                     PCT/US2003/039218<br>
2928<br>
A collar 48 is attached to a proximal end 52 of the<br>
floating probe 44 and provides a means far receiving impacts<br>
from a free mass 56 which is disposed between the born 22 and<br>
the floating probe 44 for oscillating therebetween in response<br>
5 to actuator 12 vibration. This causes low frequency impact<br>
with the floating probe 32 which in turn transfers the impact<br>
forces to the calculi as a distal end 58 of the floating probe<br>
44 is driven pass a distal end 60 of the fixed probe 32.<br>
10 The induced movement of the free mass due to vibration of<br>
the actuator 12 causes forward movement of the free mass 56<br>
against a bias provided by a spring 64, The spring 64 returns<br>
the free mass 56 to an original position abutting the distal<br>
end 36 of the horn 22,   These oscillations are at very low<br>
15  frequencies, for example, less than 1 kHz,<br>
Accotdingly, the floating probe 44 operating at these low<br>
frequencies efficiently breaks large stones into small pieces<br>
and the ultrasonically driven fixed probe 32 then is effective<br>
20  for disintegracing the ruptured calculi into finer particles<br>
which then may be aspirated through a lumen through the fixed<br>
probe 32 and a lumen through 70 through the horn 22 which<br>
communicates with, a Suction port 74 intercOnnected with a<br>
vacuum source (not shown) ,<br>
25<br>
It should be appreciated that the fixed probe 32 and the<br>
floating probe 44 shown represent a plurality of fixed and<br>
floating probes which may have a variety of tips 80, 82, 84<br>
which may include saw of serrated teeth 88, external bevels 90<br>
7<br><br>
WO 2O04/060141                                                                                     PCT/US2003/039218<br>
2928<br>
or internal bevels 92.  Tip 85 is a floating tip that may have,<br>
the cutting edge finished as 88, 90, or 92.  The tips 80, 82,<br>
84 provide examples of various configurations suitable for<br>
cutting or drilling calculi,  flesh,  or bone of different<br>
5  density and configuration.<br>
The  fixed probe  32  and  the  floating  pxobe  44  are<br>
preferably adapted for interchangement with the horn 22 either<br>
by  press  fit,   as  illustrated,   or  through  any  other<br>
10  conventional coupling arrangement such as threading,  silver<br>
solder, or welding.<br>
The fixed probe 32 and floating probe 44 may be made of<br>
various materials including grades of plastic. The outside<br>
15 diameter of the floating probe may be 4mm and for use in<br>
lithotripsy, the outside floating probe 44 may be<br>
approximately 0-1 mm shorter than the fixed probe 32 and will<br>
extend past the fixed probe 32 longitudinally when excited as<br>
hereinabove noted.<br>
A generator/controller 96 is provided for driving the<br>
actuator 12 at desired frequencies. The generator provides<br>
for varying the pulse frequencies to fit the type and size of<br>
stone or other material to assure the most expedient and<br>
25 efficient disintegration. In fact, the actuator 12 is driven<br>
at various frequencies, pulse cycles and duty cycles to<br>
maximize efficiency of the instrument 10.<br><br>

WO 2O04/060141                                                                                     PCT/US2003/039218<br>
2928<br>
The actuator 12 may be driven by the generator 96 at<br>
various frequencies, pulse cycle frequency and duty cycles to<br>
maximize the efficiency of each of the cutting tips 80, 82,<br>
84, for example,<br>
5<br>
A housing 100 is provided for containing the actuator 12<br>
and it includes a distal end 102 surrounding the fixed probe<br>
22 and floating proba 44 from the distal ends 60, 58 of the<br>
fixed and floating probes 32 and 44 at a distance. An<br>
10 interior surface 104 provides a means of support for the<br>
spring 64 which provides for the biasing element between the<br>
collar 48 and the housing distal end 102 as hereinabove noted.<br>
Although there has been hereinabove described a specific<br>
15  dual probe in accordance with the present invention for the<br>
purpose of illustrating the manner in which the invention may<br>
be used to advantage,  it should be appreciated that the<br>
