				<td>The present invention relates to a/( encapsulated oxo-bridged organometallic cluster catalyst  More particularly the present invention relates to a solid catalyst containing an organometallic cluster complex having the general formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein M and M' are transition metal ions, x and x' are in the range of 0 to 3 with the proviso that only one of x and x' may be 0, R is selected from the group consisting of an alkyl group containing 1 to 5 carbon atoms, an aryl group with 1 to 3 benzene rings, substituted alkyl and substituted aryl group, n is in the range of 3 to 6, L is selected from the group consisting of RCOO, pyridine, nitrogen containing organic bases, EbO, organic solvent or any like ligand, Y comprises a halide ion selected from the group consisting of C1O4", BF4", PF6", and BrO3" and other like ions, n' and n" are each in the range of 0 to 3. Still more particularly, it relates to the preparation of µ3-oxo-organometallic cluster catalysts inside micro and mesoporous materials like aluminosilicate zeolites, aluminophosphates, silica, carbon molecular sieves and other like materials.<br>
These µ3-oxo-bridged organometallic cluster catalysts are active in the production of aromatic carboxylic acids.<br>
Aromatic carboxylic acids, like benzoic acid, phthalic acid, terephthalic acid, trimethyl benzoic acids, naphthalene dicarboxylic acids etc., are used widely as intermediates in the chemical industry and are usually prepared from the corresponding alkyl aromatic compounds by oxidation with air in the presence of liquid phase, homogeneous catalysts like cobalt acetate, manganese acetate etc. U.S. Patent 2833816 issued to Mid Century Corporation in 1958 discloses the preparation of terephthalic acid by the oxidation ofpara-xylene by air in acetic acid solvent, at around 200°C and 200 psig pressure, in the presence of homogeneous, liquid phase catalysts comprising of cobalt, manganese and bromine. U.S. Patents 5,693,856; 3,562,318A; 5,760,288; 6,160,159; 4,329,493; 4,593,122; 4,827,025; 4,835,307; 5,087,741; 5,112,992; and EP 0 754,673 A disclose various modifications and improvements of the process of US Patent 2833816 for the manufacture of terephthalic and many other aromatic carboxylic acids. Comprehensive reviews of the oxidation of alkyl aromatic compounds to aromatic carboxylic acids are available in Suresh et al, Industrial Engineering Chemistry Research, volume 39, pages 3958 - 3997, year 2000 and W.<br><br>
Partenheimer, Catalysis Today, volume 23, pages 69 -158, year 1995. Phthalic acid is manufactured by the aerial oxidation of ortho-xylene in the vapor phase over vanadia-based catalysts.<br>
Prior art methods for the manufacture of aromatic carboxylic acids using homogeneous liquid phase processes suffer from several disadvantages. The homogeneous catalyst used is not easily separable from the products thereby limiting the reusability of the catalysts. Prior art methods also use corrosive bromide promoters requiring the use of expensive titanium steel thereby rendering the process itself more expensive. Another disadvantage of prior art methods is that acetic acid is oxidised to CO and carbon dioxide. It is therefore important to modify presently used homogeneous, liquid phase processes for the manufacture of aromatic carboxylic acids.<br>
Some of the improvements and modifications that are contemplated include: (1) replacement of homogeneous liquid phase catalysts by solid heterogeneous catalysts; (2) replacement of corrosive bromide promoters by non-corrosive compounds; (3) elimination or reduction of the significant acetic acid oxidation to CO and carbon dioxide (5- 10 wt. % of the carboxylic acid); and (4) lowering the concentration of intermediates which are difficult to remove from the final aromatic carboxylic acid product, in the reaction product.<br>
4-carboxy benzaldehyde is a typical example of an intermediate which necessitates elaborate hydrogenation and recrystallisation procedures in order to manufacture purified terephthalic acid required for the polyester industry. It is believed that the reduction in the oxidation of acetic acid to carbon dioxide and CO can be achieved by the use of more efficient radical promoters thereby allowing oxidizer temperatures to be lowered without reducing reaction rates.<br>
Replacement of homogeneous catalyst system by a heterogeneous, solid catalyst system in the production of high purity aromatic carboxylic acids is desirable to facilitate easy separation of the catalyst (i.e., metal ions) from the products and for reusability of the catalyst system.<br>
Jacob et al in the journal Applied Catalysis A: General, volume 182, year 1999, pages 91-96 described the aerial oxidation of/jora-xylene over zeolite-encapsulated salen, saltin and salcyhexen complexes of cobalt or manganese in the absence of added halogen promoters and using tertiary butyl hydroperoxide, instead of bromide ions, as the initiator at low temperatures. While significant conversion levels of para-xytene (upto 50-60 %) were attained the main product was para-tolmc acid. The yields of terephthalic acid were negligible. It was claimed that the feasibility of using a solid, non-Br-containing catalyst in<br><br>
the absence of any solvent including acetic acid for the para-xylene oxidation to toluic acid, (which is the first stage in the oxidation of pora-xylene to terephthalic acid) was established.<br>
Chavan et al in the Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical, volume 161, year 2000, pages 49 - 64 observed the formation of oxo-bridged cobalt/manganese cluster complexes in the reaction mixture and these complexes were attributed as the actual catalysts for the production of aromatic carboxylic acids.<br>
US Patents 5,849,652; 5,603,914; 5,489,424; 5,167,942, 5,767,320 and 5,932,773 disclose monomeric metal complexes encapsulated in molecular sieves. However, there is no reference to encapsulated oxo-bridged organometallic cluster complexes in prior art.<br>
In the investigations leading to the present invention, it was found that when complexes of cobalt, manganese, nickel, zirconium or any of their combinations were supported or encapsulated or grafted in solid supports, the yields of the aromatic carboxylic acids were always low in accord with the findings of Jacob et al published earlier and mentioned herein above.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an unique feature of the present invention that when the solid catalyst contains certain organometallic, cluster complexes of cobalt and manganese wherein each molecule of the cluster complex contains both cobalt and manganese, then their activity in the oxidation of alkyl aromatic compounds to aromatic carboxylic acids is enhanced significantly. The novel solid catalysts of the invention retain all the advantages of the homogeneous catalysts, such as high yields of the desired aromatic carboxylic acids (in the range of 96 to 98% weight) and are at the same time easily separated from the reaction products by simple filtration processes. This avoids the tedious process of catalyst recovery characteristic of prior art processes, and also eliminates the presence of toxic elements such as cobalt, manganese<br><br>
and nickel in the waste effluent from the process. Processes utilizing these novel solid catalysts are, hence, environmentally more beneficial.<br>
Representative of the organometallic cluster complexes of cobalt and manganese of the present invention are CoMn2(O)(CH3COO)6, Co2Mn(O)(CH3COO)6, CoMn2(O)(CH3COO)y(pyridine)Z) Co2Mn(O)(CH3COO)y(pyridine)z, where y + z = 9, etc. It was also found that the organic ligands in the above mentioned organometallic cluster complex, namely the acetate and pyridine ligands, can be replaced by other suitable organic moieties. The critical active site ensemble responsible for the high yields of aromatic carboxylic acids in the oxidation of the alkyl aromatic compounds was the heterometallic cluster complex containing both cobalt and manganese. While the exact origin of this enhancement effect is not known in detail, it is believed that multimetallic clusters of transition metal ions are better able to activate dioxygen, O2, than monometallic and monomeric ions. The common prevalence of such heteronuclear, multimetallic clusters in the O2 activating enzymatic oxygenase catalyst systems supports such a suggestion. Processes for the manufacture of aromatic carboxylic acids using solid catalysts with high, almost complete, conversion of the alkyl aromatic compound and high yields of the aromatic carboxylic acid are continually sought.<br>
The characteristic features of some of the catalysts prepared according to the invention are presented in Table 1 below:<br>
Table 1. Characterization data of solid cobalt/manganese cluster complexes<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The present invention features the application of a solid catalyst containing organometallic cluster complex of cobalt and manganese in the oxidation of the alkyl aromatic compound to the aromatic carboxylic acid in the presence of an oxygen containing gas. The separation of the solid crystals of the aromatic carboxylic acid from the reaction product and isolating from the solid crystals of aromatic carboxylic acid, an aromatic carboxylic acid having a purity greater than 99% by weight form no part of the invention.<br>
The catalyst of the invention is useful in the preparation of aromatic carboxylic<br>
acids. The preparation of aromatic carboxylic acids using the catalyst of the invention is<br>
described in our copending application No.	(CSIR Ref: NF 267/2001).<br>
