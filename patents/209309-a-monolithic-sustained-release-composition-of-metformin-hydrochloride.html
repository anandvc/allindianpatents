"FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to   a monolithic    sustained  release composition of metformin hydrochloride.<br>
The composition of the invention provides sustained release  of metformin hydrochloride over a prolong period of time.<br>
Metformin hydrochloride is a well known biguanide derivative (1,1-dimethylbiguanide monohydrochloride) which is widely used as oral antihtperglycemic agent in the management of noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM).<br>
Metformin hydrochloride being a highly water soluble drug ( &gt;300 mg/ml at 25° C) leads to the difficulty in making a sustained release dosage form.<br>
Marketed preparations available earlier with 850 mg dose of metformin hydrochloride having label of retard tablets (Glucophase RTM retard) have not been able to demonstrate any advantage in a limited volunteer trials. This probably attributable to poor choice of polymers and low dosage, desired for sustained action.<br><br><br>
US Patent No 5,955,106 by Moeckel, J. describes the process of making metformin hydrochloride 850 mg retard tablet containing hydrocolloid forming retarding agents and further control of release provided by film envelop. It however does not provide any justification for using 850 mg dose of metformin hydrochloride for delayed release preparation and the expected release rates from such compositions. This patent also does not give any invitro and in-vivo data to support its claims. Literature survey indicates metformin hydrochloride has only 40% to 60% bioavailability with high renal clearance. Hence the dose 850 mg may be insufficient to achieve therapeutic plasma concentration, around 1 |ig/ml for a sufficient period of time and might require to take such  tablets twice or thrice a day.<br>
PCT Publication No 99/47128 by Timmins et al describes a biphasic controlled release delivery system for metformin hydrochloride with inner solid particulate phase and outer solid continuous phase utilizing hydrophilic and hydrophobic polymers. These tablets are hydrodynamicaly balanced and swells upto approximately   three times its dry size   following hydration. However,<br><br><br>
it is well documented that in supine position the tablet escapes through the pylorus of the stomach after administration, which may deteriorate the tablet's in-vivo performance. Also volume desired to maintain floating of the tablet is never enough in the stomach except in fed condition. Hence making such system is doubtful with reference to its performance . Another major limitation of this patent is about dosage of the metformin hydrochloride and formulation. For instance, examples cited provides formulation of 500 mg metformin hydrochloride with tablet weight of approximately 1.0 gm. Hence restricting to the use of low dose sustained release tablets of 500 mg or slightly more only and making it obligatory to take two tablets of 500 mg each time to provide sustained action.<br>
The present invention is based on the scientific calculation of dose of metformin hydrochloride desired, based on the data available from in-vivo studies which are well documented in the scientific literature. The model used here is based on the mathematical equations provided byDobrinska and Welling (1975) which gives fairly accurate calculations about loading dose and maintenance dose for achieving sustained release effect.<br><br><br>
The dose of metformin hydrochloride is calculated by considering the  following pharmacokinetic values from the literature.<br>
Plasma concentration Cmax   =	1.02 ug/ml<br>
Elimination half life t 1/2=       6.2 hours<br>
Volume of distribution Vd     =       275 litrs<br>
Renal clearance	=       552 ±139 Litrs / min<br>
Total clearance	=        1300 ml/min<br>
Using Dobrinska and Welling model, the calculated   loading dose is<br>
283 mg and maintenance dose is 759 mg and the total dose  is 1040 mg<br>
of metformin hydrochloride  for achieving sustained release  effect for 24<br>
hours.<br>
The object of the present invention is to prepare palatable and swallowable pharmaceutical preparation containing as high as approximately 1.0 gm metformin by suitable technology showing demonstrable release rate and facilitated in-vivo absorption for the desired period. The emphasis is to develop simple monolithic system composed of hydrophobic   polymers and other excipients  with improved<br><br><br>
kinetics of extended release dosage forms and with highest possible content of active substance and the simplest method of producing it.<br>
According to the invention there is provided a monolithic sustained release composition of metformin hydrochloride with a hydrophobic material, the composition being configured to exhibit in-vitro drug release characteristics of the metformin hydrochloride while in gastic fluid having apH of 1.2 for a first hour and then in phosphate buffer having a pH of 6.8, the in-vitro drug release characteristics after the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth hours being 38 - 45% release by the first hour, 50 - 56% release by the second hour, 62 - 68% release by the third hour, 70 -75% release by the fourth floor, 80-85% release by the sixth hour, 85 - 90%) release by the seventh hour, 91 — 95% release by the eighth  hour and 96 - 100% release by the eighth  hour.<br>
The    monolithic (single phase)  sustained  release  system<br>
of the invention is a homogeneous system composed of active drug<br>
in an amount   within the range of  60 to 90% by weight, preferably<br>
70 to 80%   by weight, and one or   more hydrophobic    polymers    or<br>
one or  more   other  type    of hydrophobic  materials.   In an amount<br>
within the range   of about 15 to 40% by weight, preferably 20 to 30%<br>
by weight based on the weight of the active  substance.<br><br><br>
Hydrophobic polymers which may be employed for the sustained release system in the present invention include, but not limited to stearic acid, glycerylmonostearate, glyceryl behenate, glyceryl monooleate, glyceryl palmitostearate, microcrystalline wax, stearyl alcohol, cetyl alcohol, cetostearyl alcohol, hydrogenated castor oil, tristearin, waxes, polyethylene powder, polyvinyl chloride, shellac, rosin, and the like. Where the mixtures of the hydrophobic polymer will be employed in weight ratio to other hydrophobic material within the range of about 1 : 0.1 to 1 : 5, preferably about 1 : 0.3.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions according to the present invention can be used to produce compressed tablets of any shape, preferably oval shape and can be additionally provided with film coat of commonly used hydrophilic coating polymers. The film envelop used cane a taste neutralizing film forming agent to which dies can optionally be added can be used for elegance. The proportion by weight of the film envelop relative to the final tablet is in the usual range of 0.5 to 4.0% by weight preferably 1.0 to 1.5% by weight. Film formers such as hydroxypropyl methylcelMose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, starch, cellulose derivatives and the like.<br><br><br>
The composition according to the present invention can also be used to produce compressed slugs    and filled into capsules.<br>
Auxiliary substances which may be employed for sustained release system in the present invention include, binder, like polyvinyl pyrrolidone, gelatin, gum acacia, Klucel EF (hydroxypropyl cellulose), carboxymethyl cellulose sodium etc; Where as the glidants include, but not limited to colloidal siliconedioxide, talc, starch, and the like; lubricants include, but not limited to magnesium stearate, zinc stearate, and the like.<br>
The pharmaceutical dosage form according to the present invention such as tablet, apart from active drug and hydrophobic polymers and or hydrophobic materials may contain 1.0 to 15% by weight of a binder, preferably 3.0 to 10% by weight; and upto2.0% by weight of glidant preferably 0.5 to 1.05 by weight; andupto 2.0% by weight of lubricants preferably 0.5 to 1.0% by weight; each in relation to the tablet weight.<br>
In the present invention    the pharmaceutical  composition,<br>
such as   tablets are produced by dry mixing of active substance and<br>
optionally further auxiliary  substance    and  granulating    this mixture<br>
with hydrophobic polymers and or other hydrophobic materials by hot<br>
melt   granulation technique using jacketed rapid mixer   granulator at<br><br><br>
a temperature 40 to 120°C, preferably 60 to 80°C. This is followed by gradually cooling the granulate mass to the room temperature with continuous mixing. The resulting mass is further granulated with aqueous or organic solution of the binder followed by drying and converting it into 30 um to 2.0 mm granules, preferably 100 um to 1.0 mm by milling and sizing. Subsequently appropriate other pharmaceutical auxiliary substances are admixed with the sized granules.<br>
In the present invention the pharmaceutical composition, such as tablets are also produced by dry mixing of active substance, optionally further auxiliary substances, hydrophobic polymers and or another hydrophobic materials and binder in extruder. This mixture is extruded at a temperature 40 to 120°C, preferably 60 to 90°C in a simple extruder used for injection molding of plastics, followed by extrusion of the melted homogeneous mass with gradual cooling to room temperature and converting into 30 to 2.0 urn to 2.0 mm granules, preferably 100 uM to 1.0 mm by milling and sizing. Subsequently appropriate other pharmaceutical auxiliary substances are admixed with the sized granules.<br>
The    composition      produced       in this manner	is<br>
subsequently    processed	in the    usual    manner    to    produce<br><br><br>
pharmaceutical dosage forms, such as e.g. Compressed into tablets or filling of pressed slugs into capsule. The tablets can be coated with a film using the standard coating processes and methods such as conventional coating pan or fluid coating  process.<br>
The sustained release tablets according to the present invention release metformin hydrochloride in a controlled manner to provide an effect over a time period upto 24 hours, preferably over 18 hours as per  the calculations.<br>
