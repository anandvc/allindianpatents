COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10, Rule 13]<br>
"NOVEL LIGANDS FOR THE THYROID RECEPTOR"<br>
BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB COMPANY, a Delaware corporation of Lawrenceville-Princeton Rd., P.O. Box 4000, Princeton, New Jersey 08543-4000, United States of America,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the    <br>
invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-	<br><br><br>
The present invention relates to a novel ligands for the thyroid receptor having the general formula.<br>
This invention relates to novel compounds which are thyroid receptor ligands,' and are preferably selective for the thyroid hormone receptor (J, and to methods of preparing such compounds and to methods for using such compounds such as in the regulation of metabolism.<br>
While the extensive role of thyroid hormones in regulating metabolism in humans is well recognized, the discovery and development of new specific drugs for improving the treatment of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism has been slow.  This has also limited the development of thyroid agonists and antagonists for treatment of other important clinical indications, such as hypercholesterolemia, obesity and cardiac arrhythmias.<br>
Thyroid hormones affect the metabolism of virtually every cell of the body.  At normal levels, these hormones maintain body weight, the metabolic rate, body temperature, and mood, and influence serum low density lipoprotein (LDL) levels.  Thus, in hypothyroidism there is weight gain, high levels of LDL cholesterol, and depression.  In excess with hyperthyroidism, these hormones lead to weight loss, hypermetabolism, lowering of serum LDL levels, cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, muscle weakness, bone loss in postmenopausal women, and anxiety.<br>
Thyroid hormones are currently used primarily as replacement therapy for patients with hypothyroidism. Therapy with L-thyroxine returns metabolic functions to normal and can easily be monitored with routine serum measurements of levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), thyroxine (3,5,3',5'-tetraiodo-L-thyronine, or T4) and triiodothyronine (3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine, or T3) . However, replacement therapy, particularly in older<br>
-2-<br><br>
LA0057 PCT<br>
individuals is limited by certain of the deleterious effects of thyroid hormones.<br>
In addition, some effects of thyroid hormones may be therapeutically useful in non-thyroid disorders if adverse effects can be minimized or eliminated.  These potentially useful influences include weight reduction, lowering of serum LDL levels, amelioration of depression and stimulation of bone formation.  Prior attempts to utilize thyroid hormones pharmacologically to treat these disorders have been limited by manifestations of hyperthyroidism, and in particular by cardiovascular toxicity.<br>
Development of specific and selective thyroid hormone receptor agonists could lead to specific therapies for these common disorders while avoiding the cardiovascular and other toxicities of native thyroid hormones.  Tissue-selective thyroid hormone agonists may be obtained by selective tissue uptake or extrusion, topical or local delivery, targeting to cells through other ligands attached to the agonist and targeting receptor subtypes. Thyroid hormone receptor agonists that interact selectively with the p-form of the thyroid hormone receptor offers an especially attractive method for avoiding cardio-toxicity.<br>
Thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) are, like other nuclear receptors, single polypeptide chains.  The various receptor forms appear to be products of two different genes a and β.  Further isoform differences are due to the fact that differential RNA processing results in at least two isoforms from each gene. The TRα1 TRβ1 and TRβ2 isoforms bind thyroid hormone and act as ligand-regulated transcription factors.  In adults, the TRβ1 isoform is the most prevalent form in most tissues, especially in the liver and muscle.  The TRα2 isoform is prevalent in the pituitary and other parts of the central nervous system, does not bind thyroid hormones, and acts in many contexts as a transcriptional repressor.  The TRα2<br><br>
LAO057 PCT<br>
isoform is also widely distributed, although its levels are generally lower than those of the TRβ1 isoform.  This isoform may be especially important for development. Whereas many mutations in the TRp gene have been found and lead to the syndrome of generalized resistance to thyroid hormone, mutations leading to impaired TRα function have not been found.<br>
A growing body of data suggest that many or most effects of thyroid hormones on the heart, and in particular on the heart rate and rhythm, are mediated through the α form of the TRα1 isoform, whereas most actions of the hormone such as on the liver, muscle and other tissues are mediated more through the p-forms of the receptor.  Thus, a TRβ-selective agonist might not elicit the cardiac rhythm and rate influences of the hormones but would elicit many other actions of the hormones.  It is believed that the a-form of the receptor is the major drive to heart rate for the following reasons:<br>
1)	tachycardia is very common in the syndrome of generalized resistance to thyroid hormone in which there are defective TRβ-forms, and high circulating levels of T4 and T3;<br>
2)	there was a tachycardia in the only described patient with a double deletion of the TRp gene<br>
(Takeda et al, J. Clin. Endrocrinol. &amp; Metab. 1992, Vol. 74, p. 49);<br>
3)	a double knockout TRa gene (but not p-gene) in the mouse has a slower pulse than control mice; and,<br>
4)	western blot analysis of human myocardial TRs show presence of the TRα1 TRα2 and TRβ2 proteins, but not TRβ1.<br>
If these indications are correct, then a TRp-selective agonist could be used to mimic a number of thyroid hormone actions, while having a lesser effect on the heart.  Such a compound may be used for: (1)<br><br>
LA0057 PCT<br>
replacement therapy in elderly subjects with hypothyroidism who are at risk for cardiovascular complications; (2) replacement therapy in elderly subjects with subclinical hypothyroidism who are at risk for cardiovascular complications; (3) obesity; (4) hypercholesterolemia due to elevations of plasma LDL levels; (5) depression; and, (6) osteoporosis in combination with a bone resorption inhibitor.<br>

The compounds of formula I may be prepared by the exemplary processes described in the following reaction schemes, as well as relevant published literature procedures that are used by one skilled in the art. Exemplary reagents and procedures for these reactions appear hereinafter and in the working Examples. Protection and deprotection in the Schemes below may be carried out by procedures generally known in the art (see, for example, T. W. Greene &amp; P. G. M. Wuts, "Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis", 3rd Edition, Wiley, 1999).<br>
Scheme 1 depicts a general synthetic approach to compounds of formula I for which X = 0 that utilizes the coupling of an appropriately substituted iodonium salt 1<br><br>
LA0057 PCT<br>
to the appropriate phenol 2 to provide intermediate 3. In structure 1 and all other applicable structures contained in further schemes described below, PG refers to a protecting group appropriate for the functional group indicated (in this instance, for a phenolic oxygen).  The specific protecting groups for each particular intermediate are well understood by those versed in the art (see also the reference, "Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis", cited above).  Subsequent protecting group and functional group manipulation provides the desired compounds of formula I.  For example, intermediate 2 may be a nitrophenol (R' and R" are oxygen) and the resulting coupling product would be the corresponding diaryl ether nitro compound 3 where R1 = R" =0.  This nitro intermediate can be readily reduced to the corresponding aryl amine (see discussion below). The resulting aryl amine can then be readily acylated to provide the desired compounds of formula I (X = 0). Intermediate 2 may also be a protected amino function, for example R' = R5 and R" = PG.  The protecting group (PG) may be carbamates such as t-butyloxycarbonyl (BOC) or benzyloxycarbonyl (CBZ), which may be later removed by acidolysis and/or hydrogenolysis under standard conditions.  Acylation of the resulting aryl amine, again by means well-known to those versed in the art, provides the desired compounds of formula I.  In addition, the aryl amine (intermediate 3 where R' = R" = H) resulting from reduction of a nitrobenzene' coupling product can be reacted with an aldehyde in a reductive amination reaction, thus installing the group R5 which comes from the aldehyde moiety.  Reductive amination procedures, such as by the use of sodium cyanoborohydride or sodium triacetoxyborohydride, are well known to those skilled in the art.  The resulting product can then be acylated by standard procedures to provide compounds of formula I.<br><br>
LA0057 PCT<br>
Scheme l<br><br>
The iodonium salt methodology depicted in Scheme 1 is amply described in the literature for the synthesis of thyroid hormone analogs ("Novel Thyroid Receptor Ligands and Methods", Y.-L. Li, Y. Liu, A. Hedfors, J. Malm, C. Mellin, M. Zhang, PCT Int. App. WO 9900353' Al 990107; D. M. B. Hickey et al., J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I, 3103-3111, 1988; N. Yokoyama et al., J. Med. Chem., 38,   695-707, 1995), and to diaryl ethers in general (E. A. Couladouros, V. I. Moutsos, Tetrahedron Lett., 40,   7023-7026, 1999).<br>
Scheme 2 depicts another general synthetic approach to compounds of formula I for which X = O in which an appropriately substituted nitrobenzene intermediate 5 is alkylated with an appropriately substituted phenol 4 to provide the nitro intermediate 6.  The nitro function in intermediate 6 can be reduced to an amino group by methods well known in the art, such as the use of catalytic hydrogenation in the presence of, for example, Raney nickel or palladium on charcoal catalyst, in a polar solvent such as glacial acetic acid or ethanol. Alternatively, the reduction can be accomplished using iron powder in aqueous glacial acetic acid at ambient temperatures. Subsequent protecting group and functional group manipulation provides the desired compounds of formula I.<br>
Scheme 2<br><br>

This approach depicted in Scheme 2 for the general synthesis of diaryl ethers for thyromimetics is well precedented in the literature (P. D. Leeson, J. C. Emmett, J. Chem. Perkin Trans. I, 3085-3096, 1988; N. Yokoyama et al., J. Med. Chem., 38,   695-707, 1995).<br>

Methods applicable to the synthesis of compounds of formula I in which X = 0 and R2 and R3 are independently varied as hydrogen, halogen and alkyl are described in "Novel Thyroid Receptor Ligands and Methods", Y.-L. Li, Y. Liu, A. Hedfors, J. Malm, C. Mellin, M. Zhang, PCT Int. App. WO 9900353 Al 990107.<br>
Another general approach to the synthesis of compounds of formula I in which X = 0 is shown in Scheme 3.  In this approach, an appropriately substituted iodonium salt 1 is coupled to the appropriately<br><br>
LA0057 PCT<br>
substituted 4-hydroxybenzoic acid intermediate 7.  The carboxyl protecting group (PG1) in the resulting coupling product 8 is then removed.  The resulting free carboxylic acid intermediate corresponding to 8 is then subjected to a Curtius rearrangement by the use of known reagents for that transformation such as diphenylphosphoryl azide<br>
(DPPA).  The Curtius rearrangement intermediate can be trapped by either t-butanol or benzyl alcohol to give the product 9, a t-butyloxycarbonyl (BOO or a benzyloxycarbonyl (CBZ) protected aniline, respectively. These protecting groups can be removed by methods well known in the art to give the corresponding free amine group.  The amine can then be acylated to give compounds of formula I with X = 0 by one of any number of well-established procedures, such as acylation with a free carboxylic acid by using a coupling reagent such as dicyclohexyl carbodiimide (DCC) or (l-[3-<br>
(dimethylamino)propyl]-3-ethylcarbodiimide (EDCI). Alternatively, the free amine can be acylated using a carboxylic acid chloride derivative in the presence of an equivalent amount of a tertiary organic amine such as triethylamine or N-methyl morpholine.<br>
