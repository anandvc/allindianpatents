				<td>Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to communication systems. More particularly, and not by<br>
way of limitation, the present invention is directed to a system and method that enables<br>
the user of a communication device to interrupt, or barge-in, during a system voice<br>
announcement, or prompt, to initiate a desired function prior to the conclusion of the<br>
prompt.<br>
Background Art<br>
In communication networks, system operators often find it convenient to implement<br>
automated system voice announcements, or "prompts", to inform subscribers, for<br>
example, of certain available features or certain actions that the subscriber must take to<br>
activate particular features. For many subscribers, this information is useful the first few<br>
times they hear it, but after hearing it several times, subscribers may wish to interrupt, or<br>
"barge-in", during the system voice prompt because they already know what the prompt<br>
says and what actions they need to take. In existing communication networks, a barge-in<br>
capability is normally realized by running a standard speech recognizer during the voice<br>
prompt. In order to avoid erroneous speech recognizer output due to the input of both the<br>
user's voice and the sound (echo) of the prompt originating from the device's<br>
loudspeaker, an acoustic echo cancellation technique is normally utilized to suppress<br>
feedback of the prompt echo to the recognizer.<br>
As next generation communication devices are developed, it will be increasingly<br>
important to have user-friendly man-machine interfaces (MMIs) that enable the devices to<br>
be operated in a hands-free mode. Multi-modal MMIs and intelligent speech-driven<br>
dialog interfaces are needed that are well accepted by users and that provide flexible<br>
interaction with the system. An improved capability to barge-in will be required in order<br>
to enable a user to interrupt a system prompt by simply speaking while the prompt is<br>
being played.<br><br><br>
There are three major shortcomings of the existing methods of providing a barge-in<br>
capability. First, conventional echo cancellation algorithms may provide a very weak<br>
attenuation of the prompt echo. For example, echo attenuation of 10 dB or less may<br>
occur. This may cause serious problems with misrecognitions by the speech recognizer<br>
because the speech recognizer is triggered by the prompt echo. Second, standard adaptive<br>
echo cancellation methods require a fixed timing correlation between the voice input<br>
channel and the voice output channel. In distributed systems, however, it is often too<br>
expensive, or not possible, to obtain this temporal correlation, especially when the<br>
recognition server and the server that plays the prompt are separated by some distance.<br>
Third, standard adaptive echo cancellation methods require a considerable amount of<br>
processing power. This is a significant challenge for embedded systems with restrictive<br>
hardware constraints or for multi-channel applications where as many channels as possible<br>
have to be processed in parallel.<br>
Due to the above-described shortcomings of conventional echo cancellation<br>
methodologies, an alternative methodology for enabling the user of a hands-free<br>
communication device to barge-in during a system voice prompt is needed.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
In one aspect, the present invention is directed to a method of suppressing speech<br>
recognition errors in a speech recognition system in which an input signal includes an<br>
echo from a system voice prompt combined with user input speech. The method includes<br>
the steps of generating an acoustic model of the system voice prompt that mathematically<br>
represents the system voice prompt; supplying the input signal to a speech recognizer<br>
having an acoustic model of a target vocabulary that mathematically represents at least<br>
one command word; and comparing the input signal to the acoustic prompt model and to<br>
the acoustic target vocabulary model. The method then determines whether the acoustic<br>
prompt model or the acoustic target vocabulary model provides a best match for the input<br>
signal during the comparing step. If the acoustic target vocabulary model provides the<br>
best match, the best match is accepted. If the acoustic prompt model provides the best<br>
match, the best match is ignored. The speech recognizer may also use a silence model and<br>
traditional garbage models such as noise models and out-of-vocabulary word models to<br><br>
reduce the likelihood that noises and out-of-vocabulary words in the user utterance will be<br>
mapped erroneously onto active vocabulary words.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention is directed to a method of suppressing speech<br>
recognition errors and improving word accuracy in a speech recognition system that<br>
enables a user of a communication device to interrupt a system voice prompt with<br>
command words that halt the voice prompt and initiate desired actions. The method<br>
includes the steps of generating an acoustic model of the system voice prompt that<br>
mathematically represents the system voice prompt; storing the acoustic prompt model in<br>
a speech recognizer; and storing a target vocabulary model in the speech recognizer that<br>
includes models of a plurality of command words. The method also includes supplying<br>
the input signal to a comparer in the speech recognizer; comparing the input signal to the<br>
acoustic target vocabulary model and the acoustic prompt model to identify which model<br>
provides a best match for the input signal; ignoring the best match if the acoustic prompt<br>
model provides the best match; and accepting the best match if the acoustic target<br>
vocabulary model provides the best match. The method also includes supplying to an<br>
action table, any command word corresponding to the best match provided by the acoustic<br>
target vocabulary model; identifying from the action table, an action corresponding to the<br>
supplied command word; halting the system voice prompt; and initiating the identified<br>
action.<br>
In yet another aspect, the present invention is directed to a speech recognizer for<br>
recognizing input command words while suppressing speech recognition errors, wherein a<br>
signal input to the speech recognizer includes an echo from a system voice prompt<br>
combined with user input speech. The speech recognizer includes an acoustic vocabulary<br>
model that mathematically represents at least one command word; an acoustic prompt<br>
model that mathematically represents the system voice prompt; and a comparer that<br>
receives the input signal and compares the input signal to the acoustic vocabulary model<br>
and to the acoustic prompt model to determine which model provides a best match for the<br>
input signal. The comparer accepts the best match if the acoustic target vocabulary model<br>
provides the best match, and ignores the best match if the acoustic prompt model provides<br>
the best match. The speech recognizer may also use a silence model and traditional<br><br><br>
garbage models such as noise models and out-of-vocabulary word models to reduce the<br>
likelihood that noises and out-of-vocabulary words in the user utterance will be mapped<br>
erroneously onto active vocabulary words.<br>
In still yet another aspect, the present invention is directed to a speech recognition system<br>
for suppressing speech recognition errors and improving word accuracy. The system<br>
enables a user of a communication device to interrupt a system voice prompt with<br>
command words that halt the voice prompt and initiate desired actions. The system<br>
includes means for generating an acoustic model of the system voice prompt that<br>
mathematically represents the system voice prompt; an acoustic vocabulary model<br>
comprising mathematical models of a plurality of command words; and a comparer that<br>
receives an input signal comprising both user speech and an echo of the system voice<br>
prompt, and compares the input signal to the acoustic vocabulary model and to the<br>
acoustic prompt model to determine which model provides a best match for the input<br>
signal. The comparer accepts the best match if the acoustic target vocabulary model<br>
provides the best match, and ignores the best match if the acoustic prompt model provides<br>
the best match. The system also includes an action table that receives a command word<br>
from the comparer upon a determination by the comparer that the acoustic target<br>
vocabulary model provides the best match. The action table associates the received<br>
command word with a corresponding action, and notifies an associated network to initiate<br>
the corresponding action, and to halt the system voice prompt.<br>

Detailed Description of Embodiments<br>
Contrary to traditional approaches utilizing an echo cancellation algorithm, the present<br>
invention generates an acoustic prompt model and utilizes the acoustic prompt model as a<br>
"garbage" model in parallel with the active vocabulary words of the speech recognizer to<br>
compensate within the recognizer for the acoustic echo of the prompt. A specific acoustic<br>
prompt model is generated from the announcement to compensate for the false alarms of<br>
the recognizer. Since the system prompt is typically announced using a single speaker's<br>
voice, a speaker-dependent acoustic model of the system prompt is preferably generated.<br>
In this process, the acoustic prompt model is trained using the speech signal of the specific<br>
system prompt, and thus represents the system prompt, including speech and any other<br>
sounds (e.g., beeps and the like) that are present in the prompt. Alternatively, a speaker-<br>
independent acoustic model of the system prompt may be generated. In this process, the<br><br><br>
orthographic text of the prompt is utilized to build the prompt model by concatenating the<br>
appropriate phonetic units.<br>
The prompt model may be created through offline training in advance, or by online<br>
generation. In the first alternative, the various system prompts are known, and the<br>
acoustic prompt models are trained in advance. This method is suitable for both speaker-<br>
independent phonetic training and speaker-dependent training using the speech signal of<br>
the prompt. The prompt server is provided with a list of system prompts, and the speech<br>
recognizer is provided with a corresponding list of acoustic prompt models. When a<br>
prompt is to be played, a system controller instructs the prompt server to play, for example<br>
prompt "n", and instructs the speech recognizer to use the corresponding acoustic prompt<br>
model "n". When utilizing speaker-independent phonetic training, phonetic units are<br>
determined from the various system prompts, and may be stored in a database accessible<br>
by the recognizer. When the controller informs the recognizer of the prompt model to be<br>
utilized, the controller sends the orthographic text of the prompt to the recognizer. The<br>
recognizer then builds the prompt model by concatenating the appropriate phonetic units,<br>
which are selected utilizing the orthographic text of the prompt. When using online<br>
generation, the acoustic prompt model is generated immediately before the speech<br>
recognizer is started. The system controller sends the speech signal of the prompt to the<br>
recognizer, and the recognizer builds up the prompt model from the speech signal and<br>
starts recognition.<br>
During recognition, the Viterbi path is allowed to leave the acoustic prompt model in each<br>
state to enable the beginning of a user input. Thus, as soon as the user utters a valid<br>
command word, the Viterbi path leaves the acoustic prompt model and enters an active<br>
vocabulary word model. Thus, the prompt model needs only to be partially recognized<br>
until the user interrupts the system by his user input.<br>
FIG. 1 is a simplified block diagram of an Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) system<br>
10 suitable for use with the present invention. A prompt server 11 plays a system voice<br>
prompt. At the same time, a speech recognizer 12 analyzes speech input from the user.<br>
The user's speech input 13 and background noise 14 are input through a microphone 15.<br><br><br>
Function H(z) 16 represents the microphone and voice input channel characteristics. In<br>
the experimental verification of the present invention, no special microphone or voice<br>
input channel characteristics, H(z), were considered because the user's speech input was<br>
considered to implicitly contain the microphone and channel characteristics.<br>
In addition to the noisy user input, two types of echos also arrive at the speech recognizer<br>
12. Function L(z) 17 models the path of the line echo, which is caused by electrical<br>
feedback in the telephone device and telephone network. In the development of the<br>
present invention, the line echo, L(z), was assumed to be negligible with respect to the<br>
acoustic echo, especially in hands-free environments. Function P(z) 18 represents an echo<br>
transfer function for the acoustic echo of the prompt. The acoustic transfer function is a<br>
mathematical description of how the sound waves of the prompt are modified when they<br>
travel from the loudspeaker to the microphone on the user's device. It is particularly<br>
important to consider this type of echo, and the echo transfer function, when operating in a<br>
hands-free environment where the user's loudspeaker is set at a high volume. Of course,<br>
the characteristics of the echo transfer function depend on the actual physical environment<br>
of the user.<br>
As noted above, a system controller 19 instructs the prompt server 11 to play a selected<br>
system voice prompt, and instructs the speech recognizer 12 to use an acoustic prompt<br>
model corresponding to the selected voice prompt. Thus, a system prompt database 11a<br>
may be associated with the prompt server, and may be accessed by the prompt server<br>
when directed by the system controller. The system prompt database may be internal or<br>
external to the prompt server. Likewise, a phonetic units database 12a may be associated<br>
with the speech recognizer. The phonetic units database may be internal or external to the<br>
speech recognizer. When utilizing offline, speaker-independent phonetic training of the<br>
acoustic prompt model, the system controller 19 provides the speech recognizer with the<br>
orthographic text of the selected prompt. The speech recognizer 12 then retrieves the<br>
appropriate phonetic units from the phonetic units database 12a and concatenates them to<br>
build the acoustic prompt model corresponding to the selected system voice prompt.<br><br><br>
For the experiments discussed below, sound measurements were taken under three<br>
different sets of real-world conditions, and three different echo transfer functions were<br>
defined and utilized. The three conditions were a cafeteria, a conference room, and a car.<br>
Additionally, two types of noise (babble noise and car noise) were added to the input<br>
signal. The noise inputs were added to the system with varying attenuation of the noise<br>
signal so that experiments could be carried out at varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs).<br>
FIG. 2 is a simplified block diagram of the speech recognizer 12 in a preferred<br>
embodiment of the present invention. The speech recognizer works by matching a set of<br>
acoustic models 21-26 against an input user utterance 27. A comparer 28 receives the<br>
input user utterance and compares the input to the various models. The comparer may<br>
include a simple connected word recognition grammar, an arbitrary grammar, or a so-<br>
called "language model" to make the comparison. Target vocabulary acoustic models 21<br>
represent the words that the speech recognizer should be able to recognize. These models<br>
form the active vocabulary (command words) of the speech recognizer. In addition to<br>
these target vocabulary acoustic models, other acoustic models are used within the<br>
recognizer to represent the rest of the speech signal. First, there is a "silence" model 22<br>
that is an acoustic representation of silence (i.e., no user input and no noise).<br>
Additionally, there are "garbage" models 23 that include models of common noises 24<br>
such as babble or car noise, and/or models of Out-Of-Vocabulary (OOV) words 25 that<br>
are not among the active vocabulary. The use of these garbage models reduces the<br>
likelihood that noises and OOV words in the user utterance will be mapped erroneously<br>
onto vocabulary words. The present invention adds an acoustic prompt model 26 to the<br>
speech recognizer as an additional garbage model. This model reduces the likelihood that<br>
words in a system prompt echo contained in the user utterance will be mapped<br>
erroneously onto vocabulary words. If any of the garbage models gives the best match<br>
during the recognition process, the matching noises, OOV words, and system prompt<br>
words are ignored, and no recognition errors occur.<br>
When the best match during the recognition process is an active vocabulary command<br>
word, the recognizer enters an action table 29 where the recognized word is associated<br>
with a corresponding action 30. The speech recognizer 12 may then send the<br><br><br>
corresponding action to the network to be executed. In a barge-in situation, then network<br>
then sends a command to the prompt server 11 to halt the system voice prompt.<br>
FIG. 3 is a flow chart illustrating the steps of the preferred embodiment of the method of<br>
the present invention. At step 31, the speech recognizer 12 is prepared for the recognition<br>
task by storing in it, the target vocabulary acoustic models 21, the silence model 22, the<br>
noise models 24, and the OOV words models 25. At step 32, the acoustic prompt model<br>
26 is generated or "trained". As noted above, the prompt model may be created through<br>
offline training in advance, or by online generation. At step 33, the acoustic prompt<br>
model 26 is stored in, or otherwise made available to, the speech recognizer 12 as an<br>
additional garbage model 23. At step 34, a user input signal is supplied to the speech<br>
recognizer. The input signal includes the user's speech input along with background<br>
noise, and microphone and voice input channel characteristics. In a barge-in situation in<br>
which a system voice prompt is playing, the input signal also includes line echo caused by<br>
electrical feedback in the telephone device and telephone network, and the system voice<br>
prompt echo.<br>
At step 35, the speech recognizer compares the input signal against the various acoustic<br>
models to determine a best match. At step 36, it is determined which model gives the best<br>
match during the recognition process. If the silence, noise, OOV words, or acoustic<br>
prompt model gives the best match, the method moves to step 37, and then ignores the<br>
match at step 38, and no recognition errors occur. However, if the target vocabulary<br>
acoustic model gives the best match, the method moves to step 39 and then at step 40,<br>
sends the recognized word to the action table 29. At step 41, the action table associates<br>
the recognized word with a corresponding action and sends the corresponding action to<br>
the network for execution. At step 42, the method concludes by sending a halt command<br>
from the network to the prompt server 11, and executing the corresponding action within<br>
the network.<br>
Experimental Results<br>
A large number of experiments, with a wide range of conditions (i.e., type of noise, type<br>
of echo, SNR) were performed. For each scenario, a baseline experiment without acoustic<br><br><br>
prompt models was compared to an experiment with acoustic prompt models. Several<br>
different recordings of 32 male and 32 female users were utilized as user input for the<br>
tests.<br>
The recognition task analyzed in the experiments was typical for voice-controlled<br>
telephone applications. The active vocabulary consisted of five command words. In<br>
addition, a set of garbage models was used to cope with unexpected user input,<br>
background noise (i.e., babble noise and car noise), and the echo of the announcement. In<br>
the experiments, all command words, garbage models, and the prompt model (when<br>
applicable) were inserted in parallel into a simple connected word recognition grammar.<br>
The prompts for the experiments were generated using a state-of-the-art text-to-speech<br>
system producing naturally sounding voice announcements. For this purpose, fourteen<br>
different prompts with durations between one and seven seconds were chosen and<br>
synthesized by one male and one female speaker. As is typical for telephone applications,<br>
the prompts themselves contained vocabulary command words that the recognizer is<br>
trying to hear from the user's speech input. For example, "help" is a vocabulary<br>
command word, and "say help for help" is one of the prompts. Thus, a goal of the<br>
invention is to enable the recognizer to reject the word "help" when it is contained in a<br>
prompt, but to accept the word "help" as a command word when it is spoken by the user.<br>
Basically, two types of experiments were conducted. First, only the prompt echo, with no<br>
user input, was supplied to the speech recognizer. This type of experiment measures the<br>
ability of the recognizer to ignore the prompt echo to avoid false acceptances. Second,<br>
both the prompt echo and the user input were supplied to the speech recognizer. The user<br>
input was randomly varied to start at different times within the boundaries of the prompt,<br>
to realistically represent a barge-in case. This type of experiment measures the ability of<br>
the recognizer to reliably accept a user-input command word while minimizing false<br>
acceptances generated by command words within the prompt echo.<br>
The prompt echo supplied to the speech recognizer is generally attenuated, and is<br>
convolved with a specific room impulse response. Therefore, the invention utilizes an<br><br><br>
attenuated version of the original prompt signal to train a speaker-dependent prompt<br>
model. This procedure helps reduce the mismatch between training and test for prompt<br>
models, and therefore improves recognition performance.<br>
The graph in FIG. 4 illustrates the effect of attenuating the prompt for prompt model<br>
training for an exemplary scenario utilizing the car echo transfer function and car noise at<br>
15 dB. The graph shows the false acceptance rate of the speech recognizer as a function<br>
of the level of echo attenuation when only the prompt is present (i.e., there is no user<br>
input). Each of the curves represents the false acceptance rate of the speech recognizer for<br>
prompt model training at different attenuation levels of the original signal. The graph<br>
illustrates that the best results were obtained when the prompt model was trained at a 20<br>
dB attenuation level. Other experiments, utilizing the cafeteria and the conference room<br>
echo transfer functions, also showed that, on average, training at the 20 dB attenuation<br>
level yielded the best results for the complete range of echo attenuation. Thus, this<br>
procedure should be applied in all cases in which the actual attenuation is unknown.<br>
Training of the prompt model at 20 dB attenuation was also used for all of the following<br>
experiments.<br>
The graph in FIG. 5 illustrates the results of an exemplary experiment comparing the false<br>
acceptance rates without the use of a prompt model and with the use of a prompt model,<br>
when only the acoustic prompt echo was present (i.e., there was no user input). The<br>
experiment utilized the car echo transfer function and car noise at 15 dB. Each of the<br>
curves represents the false acceptance rate of the speech recognizer as a function of the<br>
level of attenuation of the acoustic car echo. It can be seen that the use of a prompt model<br>
drastically improved the false acceptance rate, virtually eliminating false acceptances at<br>
all levels of attenuation.<br>
The graph in FIG. 6 illustrates the results of an exemplary experiment comparing the word<br>
correct rates without the use of a prompt model and with the use of a prompt model, when<br>
user input is present in addition to the acoustic prompt echo. Only substitutions and<br>
deletions were considered as errors. FIG. 6 again illustrates a scenario utilizing the car<br>
echo transfer function and car noise at 15 dB. Each of the curves represents the word<br><br><br>
correct rate of the speech recognizer as a function of the level of attenuation of the<br>
acoustic car echo. It is to be expected that as a tradeoff for eliminating false acceptances,<br>
the word correct rate would be degraded. The experiment showed that for a low level of<br>
echo attenuation of 10 dB, the word correct rate decreased from 93.5% to 88.9% when<br>
using the prompt model. However, for higher levels of attenuation (for example, 20 dB<br>
and above), use of the prompt model had a negligible effect on the word correct rate.<br>
The graph in FIG. 7 illustrates the results of an exemplary experiment comparing word<br>
accuracy rates without the use of a prompt model and with the use of a prompt model,<br>
when user input is present in addition to the acoustic prompt echo. Substitutions,<br>
deletions, and insertions were considered as errors. FIG. 7 again illustrates a scenario<br>
utilizing the car echo transfer function and car noise at 15 dB. Each of the curves<br>
represents the word accuracy rate of the speech recognizer as a function of the level of<br>
attenuation of the acoustic car echo. When analyzing the effect of the prompt model on<br>
word accuracy, the benefits of the present invention become even more apparent. The<br>
small negative effect of the prompt model on the word correct rate (see FIG. 6) is more<br>
than overcome by the enormous reduction of false acceptances (i.e., a reduction of<br>
insertions) (see FIG. 5). The overall result is a very significant improvement of<br>
recognition accuracy when the prompt model is utilized. For example, the recognition<br>
accuracy rises from 83.1% to 90.6% when the echo attenuation is 20 dB. For lower levels<br>
of attenuation, the improvement is even greater.<br>
As will be recognized by those skilled in the art, the innovative concepts described in the<br>
present application can be modified and varied over a wide range of applications.<br>
