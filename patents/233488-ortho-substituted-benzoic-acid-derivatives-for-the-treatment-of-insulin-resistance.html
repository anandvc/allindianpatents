				<td>Therapeutic Agents<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to certain novel benzole acid derivatives, to processes for preparing such compounds, to their utility in treating clinical conditions associated with insulin resistance, to methods for their therapeutic use and to pharmaceutical compositions containing them.<br>
Background of trie invention<br>
The Insulin Resistance Syndrome (IRS) including type 2 diabetes mellitus, which refers to a cluster of manifestations including insulin resistance with accompanying hyperinsulinaemia, possible type 2 diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension, central (visceral) obesity, dyslipidaemia observed as deranged lipoprotein levels typically characterised by elevated VLDL (very low density lipoproteins), small dense LDL particles and reduced HDL (high density lipoprotein) concentrations and reduced fibrinolysis.<br>
Recent epidemic logical research has documented that individuals with insulin resistance run a greatly increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, notably suffering frommyocardial infarction and stroke. In type 2 diabetes mellitus atherosclerosis related conditions cause up to 80% of all deaths.<br>
In clinical medicine there is awareness of the need to increase the insulin sensitivity in IRS suffering patients and thus to correct the dyslipidaemia which is considered to cause the accelerated progress of atherosclerosis. However, currently this is not a universally well defined disease.<br>
The S-enantiomer of the compound of formula C below<br>
2-ethoxy-3-[4-(2-{4-methanesulfonyloxyphenyl}ethoxy)phenyl]propanoic acid, is disclosed in PCT Publication Number WO99/62872. This compound is reported to be a modulator of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR, for a review of the PPARs see T. M.Wfflson et al, J Med Chem 2000, Vol 43, 527) and has combined PPARoc/PPARy agonist activity (Structure, 2001, Vol 9, 699, P. Cronet et al). This compound is effective in treating conditions associated with insulin resistance.<br>
Surprisingly a series of compounds has now been found which are selective PPARa modulators.<br>
Description of the invention<br>
The present invention provides a compound of formula I<br>
wherein n is 0, 1 or 2;<br>
R1 represents halo, a Chalky 1 group which is optionally substituted by one or more fluoro, a Ci^alkoxy group which is optionally substituted by one or more fluoro and wherein when n is 2 the substituents R1 may be the same or different;<br>
R2 represents an unbrauched C2-7aIkyl group;<br>
R3 represents H or OCEfe; and<br>
W represents O or S<br>
and phanoaceutically acceptable salts and prodrugs thereof.<br>
Further values of R1, R2, R3 and W in compounds of Formula I now follow. It will be understood that such values may be used with any of the definitions, claims or embodiments defined hereinbefore or hereinafter.<br>
In a first aspect R1 is halo, a Chalky! group or a Q^alkoxy group and n is 0, 1 or 2. Particularly R1 is fluoro,chloro or trifluoromethyl when n is 1. Particularly R1 is fluoro when n is 2.<br>
In a second aspect R2 represents ethyl or hexyl.<br>
In a third aspect R3 represents H. In a fourth aspect R3 represents OMe. In a fifth aspect W represents 0. In a sixth aspect W represents S.<br>
The term unbranched Ca^alkyl denotes a straight-chain, saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon having from 2 to 7 carbon atoms. Examples of said alkyl include ethyl, n-propyl, n-butyl, n- pentyl, n-hexyl and n- heptyl.<br>
It will be understood by those skilled in the art that the term interrupted as used above means that the oxygen atom is situated within the alkyl chain and is not the terminal atom The term "prodrug " as used in this specification includes derivatives of the carboxylic acid group which are converted in a mammal, particularly a Truman, into the carboxylic acid group or a salt or conjugate thereof. It should be understood that, whilst not being bound<br>
by theory, it is believed that most of the activity associated with the prodrugs arises from the activity of the compound of formula I into -which the prodrugs are converted. Prodrugs can be prepared by routine methodology well within the capabilities of someone skilled in the art. Various prodrugs of carboxy are known in the art. For examples of such prodrug derivatives, see:<br>

The present compounds of formula (I) are useful for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of clinical conditions associated with inherent or induced reduced sensitivity to insulin (insulin resistance) and associated metabolic disorders (also known as metabolic syndrome). These clinical conditions will include, but will not be limited to, general obesity, abdominal obesity, arterial hypertension, hyperinsulinaemia, hyperglycaemia, type 2 diabetes and the dyslipidaemia characteristically appearing with insulin resistance. This dyslipidaemia, also known as the atherogenic lipoprotein profile, is characterised by moderately elevated non-esterified fatty acids, elevated very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) triglyceride rich particles, high Apo B levels, low high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels associated with low apoAI particle levels and high Apo B levels in the presence of small, dense, low density lipoproteins (LDL) particles, phenotype B.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are expected to be useful in treating patients with combined or mixed hyperlipidemias or various degrees of hypertriglyceridemias and postprandial dyslipidemia with or without other manifestations of the metabolic syndrome.<br>
Treatment with the present compounds is expected to lower the cardiovascular morbidity and mortality associated with atherosclerosis due to their antidyslipidaemic as well as antiinflainmatory properties. The cardiovascular disease conditions include macro-angiopathies of various internal organs causing myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease and peripheral arterial insufficiency of the lower<br>
extremities. Because of their insulin sensitizing effect the compounds of formula I are also expected to prevent or delay the development of type 2 diabetes from the metabolic syndrome and diabetes of pregnancy. Therefore the development of long-term complications associated with chronic hyperglycaemia in diabetes mellitus such as the micro-angiopathies causing renal disease, retinal damage and peripheral vascular disease of the lower limbs are expected to be delayed. Furthermore the compounds may be useful in treatment of various conditions outside the cardiovascular system whether or not associated with insulin resistance, like polycystic ovarian syndrome, obesity, cancer and states of inflammatory disease including neurodegenerative disorders such as mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are expected to be useful in controlling glucose levels in patients suffering from type 2 diabetes.<br>
The present invention provides a method of treating or preventing dyslipidemias, the insulin resistance syndrome and/or metabolic disorders (as defined above) comprising the administration of a compound of formula I to a mammal (particularly a human) in need thereof.<br>
The present invention provides a method of treating or preventing type 2 diabetes comprising the administration of an effective amount of a compound of formula I to a mammal (particularly a human) in need thereof.<br>
In a further aspect the present invention provides the use of a compound of formula 1 as a medicament.<br>
In a further aspect the present invention provides the use of a compound of formula I in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of insulin resistance and/or metabolic disorders.<br>
Combination Therapy<br>
The compounds of the invention may be combined with another therapeutic agent that is useful in the treatment of disorders associated with the development and progress of atherosclerosis such as hypertension, hyperlipidaemias, dysEpidaemias, diabetes and obesity. The compounds of the invention may be combined with another therapeutic agent that decreases the ratio of LDL:HDL or an agent that causes a decrease in circulating levels of DDL-cholesterol In patients with diabetes mellitus the compounds of the invention may also be combined with therapeutic agents used to treat complications related to micro-angiDpathies.<br>

Biological activity Formulations<br>
Compounds were dissolved inDMSO to obtain 16 mM stock solutions. Before assays, stock solutions were further diluted in DMSO and culture media.<br>
GENERAL CHEMICALS AND REAGENTS<br>
Luciferase assay reagent was purchased from Packard, USA. Restriction Enzymes were<br>
from Boehringer and Vent polymerase from New England Biolabs.<br>
CELL LINES AND CELL CULTURE CONDITIONS<br>
U2-OS, (Osteogenic sarcoma, Human) was purchased from ATCC, USA. Cells were expanded and refrozen in batches from passage number six. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) with 25 mM glucose, 2 mM glutamine or 4 mM L-alanyl-L-glutamine,10% fetal calf serum, at 5% COa- Phosphate buffered saline (PBS) without addition of calcium or magnesium was used. All cell culture reagents were from Gibco (USA) and 96-well cell culture plates were purchased from Wallacn.<br>
PLASMTD CONSTRUCTS FOR HETEROLOGOUS EXPRESSION<br>
Standard recombinant DNA techniques were carried out as described by Ausubel (7). The Luciferase reporter vector, pGLSUAS (clone consists of five copies of the GAM DNA binding sequence, 5 '-CGACGGAGTACTGTCCTCCGAGCT-3', cloned into the SacI/XhoI sites of pGL3-Promoter (Promega). The SacI/XhoI fragment carrying the UAS sites was constructed using annealed overlapping oligonucleotides.<br>
Expression vectors used are based upon pSG5 (Stratagene). All vectors contain an EcoRI/Nhel fragment encoding the DNA binding domain of GAM (encoding amino acid positions 1-145 of database accession number P04386) followed by an in-frame fusion to a fragment encoding the nuclear localisation sequence from T antigen of Polyoma Virus. The nuclear localisation sequence was constructed using annealed overlapping oligonucleotides creating Nhel/Kpnl sticky ends<br>
(5'-CTAGCGCTCCTAGAAGAAACGCAAGGTTGGTAC-3'). The ligand binding domains from human and mouse PPARa and human and mouse PPARy were PCR amplified as KpnI/BamHI fragments and cloned in frame to the GAM DNA binding domain and the nuclear localisation sequence. The sequence of all plasmid constructs used were confirmed by sequencing. The following expression vectors were used for transient transfections:<br>
	refers to nucleotide positions of data base entry used to express the ligand binding<br>
domain.<br>
TRANSIENT TRANSFECTIONS<br>
Frozen stocks of cells from passage number six were thawed and expanded to passage number eight before trausfections. Confluent cells were trypsinised, washed and pelleted by centrifugation at 270xg for 2 minutes. The cell pellet was resuspended in cold PBS to a cell concentration of about 18 x 106 cells/ml. After addition of DNA, the cell suspension was incubated on ice for approximately 5 minutes before electroporation at 230 V, 960 fiF in Biorad's Gene Pulser™ in 0.5 ml batches. A total of 50 /xg DNA was added to each batch of 0.5 ml cells, including 2.5 jj.g expression vector, 25 /tg reporter vector and 22.5 fig unspecific DNA (pBluescript, Stratagene).<br>
After electroporation, cells were diluted to a concentration of 320'000 cells/ml in DMEM without phenol red, and approximately 25'000 cells/well were seeded in 96-well plates. In order to allow cells to recover, seeded plates were incubated at 37°C for 3-4 hours before addition of test compounds, m assays for PPARoc, the cell medium was supplemented with resin-charcoal stripped fetal calf serum (PCS) in order to avoid background activation by fatty acid components of the PCS. The resin-charcoal stripped PCS was produced as follows; for 500 ml of heat-inactivated PCS, 10 g charcoal and 25 g Bio-Rad Analytical Grade Anion Exchange Resin 200-400 mesh were added, and the solution was kept on a magnetic stirrer at room temperature over night. The following day, the PCS was centrifuged and the stripping procedure was repeated for 4-6 hours. After the second treatment, the PCS was centrifuged and filter sterilised in order to remove remnants of charcoal and resin.<br>
ASSAY PROCEDURE<br>
Stock solutions of compounds in DMSO were diluted in appropriate concentration ranges in master plates. From master plates, compounds were diluted in culture media to obtain test compound solutions for final doses.<br>
After adjustment of the amount of cell medium to 75 fj.1 in each well, 50 /xl test compound solution was added. Transiently transfected cells were exposed to compounds for about 24 hours before the luciferase detection assay was performed. For luciferase assays, 100 fj.1 of assay reagent was added manually to each well and plates were left for approximately 20 minutes in order to allow lysis of the cells. After lysis, luciferase activity was measured in a 1420 Multiwell counter, Victor, from WaUach.<br>
Reference compounds<br>
The TZD pioglitazone was used as reference substance for activation of both human and murinePPARY. 5,8,11,14-Eicosatetrayonic acid (ETYA) was used as reference substance for human PPARoc.<br>
Calculations and analysis<br>
For calculation ofEC$Q values, a concentration-effect curve was established. Values used were derived from the average of two or three independent measurements (after subtraction of the background average value) and were expressed as the percentage of the maximal activation obtained by the reference compound. Values were plotted against the logarithm of the test compound concentration. ECfQ values were estimated by linear intercalation between the data points and calculating the concentration, required to achieve 50% of the maximal activation obtained by the reference compound.<br>
The compounds of formula I have an EC50 of less than 50umol/l for PPARcc and preferred compounds have an EC5o of less than 5jamol/L For example the EC5oS of some of the Examples for human PPAR alpha are:<br><br>
