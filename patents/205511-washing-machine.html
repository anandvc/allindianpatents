				<td>Field of the Invention.<br>
The  present  invention  relates to a  washing  machine  for washing  items  to be washed that are placed  in  a  washing-cum- dewatering tub. Background of the Invention.<br>
In recent times, the washing capacity of a washing machine tends to be increasing and not a small number of washing machines are found to have the washing capacity of 8 kg or more. Accordingly, a prior art washing machine structured as described in the above requires a stronger rotational force and an enhanced agitation force in order for the entire items to be washed to be wel1 soaked in a washing water and also to be exposed to the rotation of an agitator. As a result, there have arisen such problems as damaging the items to be washed while getting rid of stains, and also entangling the items to be washed.<br>
1A.<br><br>
Summary of the Invention.<br>
The present invention deals with the problems involved with the prior art washing machine as described in the above, and the objective thereof is to do washing by circulating a washing water without exerting a mechanical force from an agitator and the like to items to be washed contained in a washing-cum-dewatering tub, thereby causing no damages and tangles to the items to be washed.<br>
In order to attain the objective as described in the above the present invention discloses a structure for a washing machine<br>
2-<br><br>
having:<br>
a washing-cum-dewatering tub installed in a water holding tub so as to be made rotatable freely;<br>
a water holding tub cover to cover the top of the water holding tub; a driving means for rotating the washing-cum-dewatering tub to produce pumping action, thereby the washing water located between the washing-cum-dewatering tub and the water holding tub being elevated to the clearance between the washing-cum-dewatering tub and the water holding tub cover and discharged downward to near the center of the washing-cum-dewatering tub; and<br>
a packing material such as sponge, rubber and the like placed between the water holding tub and the water holding tub cover to prevent water from spilling over.<br>
Accordingly, the items to be washed are allowed to be washed without any damages and tangles since the washing water is just circulated with no mechanical force applied from an agitator and the like to the items to be washed placed in the washing-cum-dewatering tub, and further without concerns for bursting forth of water, water splashing and the like.<br>
the   present invention relates to a washing machine provided with: a washing-cum-dewatering tub installed in a water holding tub so as to be made rotatable freely;<br>
a driving means for driving the foregoing washing-cum-dewatering tub; and<br>
a water holding tub cover to cover the top of the foregoing water holding tub, thereby the washing water located between the washing-cum-dewatering tub and the water holding tub being discharged    through    the    clearance    between    the    washing-cum-<br>
3<br><br>
dewatering tub and the water holding tub cover towards near the center of rotation of the washing-cum-dewatering tub by the pumping action produced by the rotational driving of the washing-cum-dewatering tub, and further provided with:<br>
a packing material such as sponge, rubber and the like placed between the water holding tub and the water holding tub cover to prevent water from spilling over. When items to be washed are placed in the washing-cum-dewatering tub and rotated in a washing water, the washing water is elevated inside of the water holding tub because of the centrifugal force caused by the rotation of the washing water, changes its direction at the water holding tub cover located atop and is discharged through the clearance between the washing-cum-dewatering tub towards near the center of rotation of the washing-cum-dewatering tub.<br>
The discharged washing water passes through the items to be washed and then returns to the outside of the washing-cum-dewatering tub doing a repeat of circulating through this path. At this time, water pressure is applied to the place, where the water holding tub and the water holding tub cover meet each other, because the washing water elevated along the inner surfaces of the washing-cum-dewatering tub hits the water holding tub cover to change its direction. However, by having a packing material inserted between the water holding tub and the water holding tub cover and preventing water from spilling over, water can be stopped from bursting forth, splashing and the like. Thus, washing can be performed without damages and tangles imposed on items to be washed just by circulating a washing water without applying any mechanical force from an agitator and the like to the items to be washed placed in the washing-cum-dewatering tub, and further    without    concerns    for    bursting    forth    of   water,    water<br>
4<br><br>
splashing and the like.<br>
The packing material can be assembled so as to be made   integral   with   the  water  holding   tub   cover   by   having   the packing   material   formed   in   a  circular   ring  like   shape   with   its cross-section   appearing   almost   like   a   U-letter   and   having   a   rib provided on the lower part of the water holding tub cover to fit with the  packing  material,  which  has  the  U-letter  like  cross-section, thereby making it possible to prevent water from bursting forth, splashing and the like not only in the vertical direction but also in the horizontal direction towards the periphery of the water holding tub  cover.      Thus,   the  washing  water  can  be  circulated  without concerns for bursting forth of water, water splashing and the like. The packing material is formed to have an almost U-letter like cross-section and also to have an almost horizontally flat section on the outside of the U-letter like shape of the packing material,   thereby establishing  an  arrangement  to prevent  water from   issuing   by   having   the   foregoing   horizontally   flat   surface sandwiched   and   fastened   in   the   vertical   direction   between   the water holding tub cover and the water holding tub.      By having the packing material sandwiched on its almost horizontally flat section with the water holding tub and the water holding tub cover,  the water can be prevented from issuing in both the vertical direction and the horizontal direction towards the periphery of the packing material with the U-letter like cross-section, and further water can be prevented from issuing in the vertical direction at the outer regions of the packing material, thus enabling the circulation<br>
5<br><br>
of the washing water without any damages and tangles inflicted to the items to be washed by preventing the leakage of the washing water even when the water holding tub and water holding tub cover are deformed due to the vibrations and the like caused during the processes of washing, rinsing and dewatering.<br><br>
The packing material is formed to have an almost U-letter like cross-section and also to have an almost horizontally flat section on the outer peripheral region of the U-letter like shape of the packing material, thereby establishing an arrangement to prevent water from bursting forth by having the foregoing horizontally flat section sandwiched between and fastened in the vertical direction with the water holding tub cover and the water holding tub. Further, at least one raised rib is provided on the foregoing water holding tub cover at the place where it comes into contact with the horizontally flat section of the packing material, thus forming an intensively fastened region on the packing material in order for the ability of preventing water from bursting forth to be enhanced without increasing the fastening force between the water holding tub cover and the water holding tub.<br>
As a result, even when the water holding tub is deformed by a thermal deformation and the like due to the use of hot water during the process of washing, the ability of preventing water from issuing can be maintained by the intensively fastened region.<br>
The water holding tub is connected with   a  water  drain  conduit  via   a   water  draining  valve   and   also<br>
6<br><br>
provided with a water overflow prevention rib surrounding the outside of the water holding tub cover to mate therewith via the packing material, and further a water overflow/water drain passage is provided on the foregoing water holding tub in the vicinity of the outer periphery thereof, leading to the foregoing water drain conduit. When a very small amount of water leakage from the packing material occurs due to deterioration with time and the like, the leaked water is blocked by the water overflow prevention rib and drained through the water drain conduit, thus enabling the circulation of the washing water and the supply of a washing machine that ensures safety against water leakage even after the periods of use.<br><br><br>
The water holding tub is connected with a water drain conduit via a water draining valve and also the water holding tub cover is provided with a water recycling wall standing upright and also with a water overflow/water drain passage in the vicinity of the outer periphery of the foregoing water holding tub, leading to the foregoing water drain conduit, and further the foregoing water recycling wall is built to introduce the overflowed water towards the water overflow/water drain passage. While preventing the overflowing of water due to splashing of water and the like caused by the rotation of the washing-cum-dewatering tub, washing can be performed without damages and tangles inflicted on the items to be washed by circulating the washing water.<br>
The water holding tub cover is provided with<br>
7<br><br>
a water guide in a freely openable/closable way to introduce the washing water discharged from the clearance between the washing-cum-dewatering tub and the water holding tub cover towards the center of rotation of the washing-cum-dewatering tub, thereby making it readily possible to scatter the washing water towards near the center of rotation of the washing-cum-dewatering tub without increasing the revolution of the washing-cum-dewatering tub or increasing the amount of the washing water in the water holding tub.<br>

Fig.11 is a longitudinal cross-sectional view of a prior art washing machine. Detailed description of the Invention.<br>
A structure of a prior art washing machine will be described with reference to Fig.11 in the fallowing:<br>
As shown in Fig.11, a washing-cum-dewatering tub 1 is made rotatable around the center axis thereof, provided with an agitator 2 on the bottom thereof, the agitator 2 being made freely rotatable, and also provided with a water holding tub 3 on the outside thereof . A motor 4 for driving the washing-cum- dewatering tub 1 and the agitator 2 is installed on the bottom of the water holding tub 3 to drive the washing-cum-dewatering tub 1 via a clutch 5 for controlling a driving unit. The water holding tub 3 is linked to an external framework 6 via a suspension 7 in such a way as vibrations are isolated. There is a liquid balancer 8, containing a liquid, fixed on the top of the washing-cum- dewatering tub 1. The top of the water holding tub 3 is covered with a water holding tub cover 9.<br>
In the washing process of the washing machine structured as described in the above, a washing water is poured in the water holding  tub  3,  items  to be washed  (clothes)  placed  in  the<br>
9.<br><br>
washing-cum-dewatering tub i are agitated by the agitator 2, the items to be flashed are soaked in the washing water and crumpled to get rid of stains. In the rinsing process, fresh water is poured in the water holding tub 3 and the items to be washed are agitated by the agitator 2 to rinse the items to be washed. In the dewatering process, the rotation of the motor 4 is transferred to the washing-cum-dewatering tub 1 by switching the clutch 5 and the rotated washing-cum-dewatering tub 1 causes the water content in the items to be washed to be extracted by centrifugal force.<br>
These processes are control led in succesion to perform each respective process of washing, rinsing and dewatering automatically.<br>
Next, exemplary embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to the drawings.<br>
(First Exemplary Embodiment)<br>
As  shown in Fig.l, a washing-cum-dewatering tub 10 has  its side  walls provided with many small holes (not shown  in  Fig.l) and  an  agitator  11  rotatably mounted  on  its  bottom.  This washing-cum-dewatering  tub  10  has  a  water  holding  tub  121 installed on its outside.<br>
10.<br><br>
The  water  holding tub 12 has a motor 13 (a  driving  means ) attached to its bottom for driving the washing-cum-dewatering tub 10  and  agitator 11 in such a way as a clutch 14 can  switch  in driving  between  the  washing-cum-dewatering  tub  10  and   the agitator 11.<br>
The wash holding tub 12 is linked to an external framework 15 via a suspension 16 so as to isolate vibrations. A water channel cover 17 is fixed to the inner wall of the washing-cum-dewatering tub 10 to form a water circulating channel 18, which is connected between a pumping chamber 20 formed around the outer periphery of a lower wing 19 that is formed integrally with the agitator 11 on its bottom side and a lint filter 21 located in the upper section of the washing-cum-dewatering tub 10.<br>
A  liquid  balancer 22 containing a liquid is fixed  to  the upper section of the washing-cum-dewatering tub 10. The top of the water  holding  tub 12  is covered with a water holding tub  cover 23.  A packing material 27 is placed between the top of the water<br>
11.<br><br>
holding   tub    12   and   the   water   holding   tub   cover   23   to   ensure watertight sealing.<br>
A water draining valve 24 is for draining a washing water from the water holding tub 12 and a water feeding valve 25 is for feeding a washing water to the water holding tub 12. A controller 26 controls the operating status of the motor 13, water draining valve 24, water feeding valve 25 and the like, thereby controlling a series of the processes of washing, rinsing and dewatering in succession. In case where items to be washed are delicate, the washing-cum-dewatering tub 10 is rotated at 300 rpm, for example, for each respective process of washing and rinsing to have the washing water located between the washing-cum-dewatering tub 10 and the water holding tub cover 23 elevated by pumping action caused by the rotation of the washing-cum-dewatering tub 10 and then discharged downward to near the center of rotation of the washing-cum-dewatering tub 10.<br>
In the structure as described in the above, when the washing-cum-dewatering tub 10 is rotated after items to be washed have been placed in the washing-cum-dewatering tub 10 and a washing water has been fed by opening the water feeding valve 25, upward motion is produced by centrifugal force due to rotation, thereby causing the washing water to ascend the inner surface of the water holding tub 12, and the washing water thus ascending between the washing-cum-dewatering tub 10 and the water holding tub 12 hits the water holding tub cover 23 and changes its direction, and then bursts forth from the clearance between the washing-cum-dewatering tub 10 (the top of the liquid balancer 22) and the water holding tub cover 23 downward to near the center of rotation of the washing-cum-dewatering tub 10.<br>
After    passing    through    the    items    to    be    washed,    the<br><br>
discharged washing water passes again through many small holes (not shown in the drawing) formed on the side walls of the washing-cum-dewatering tub 10 and circulates through channels that shift in position between the washing-cum-dewatering tub 10 o and the water holding tub 12, thereby allowing stains to get rid of from the items to be washed while the washing water passing through the items to be washed. It is noteworthy that the washing water can be infiltrated effectively throughout the items to be washed by centrifugal force since the washing water bursts forth between the washing-cum-dewatering tub 10 and the water holding tub cover 23 downward to near the center of rotation of the washing-cum-dewatering tub 10.<br>
The washing water ascending the inner surface of the water holding tub 12 caused by the centrifugal force produced by the rotation of the washing-cum-dewatering tub 10 hits the water holding tub cover 23, changes its direction and bursts forth between the washing-cum-dewatering tub 10 and the water holding tub cover 23, resulting in an application of a high pressure to the fit between the water holding tub 10 and the water holding tub cover 23. In order to prevent a leakage of the washing water due to this high pressure, a packing material 27 is employed to be placed therebetween. Accordingly, there is little concern for the leakage of the washing water due to the high pressure caused by bursting forth of the washing water, thereby making it possible to perform the washing of the items to be washed without damages and tangles by circulating the washing water and without applying a mechanical force caused by the agitator 11 and the like to the items to be washed in the washing-cum-dewatering tub 10.<br>
The   packing   material   27  of the   above   includes   sponge, rubber, putty and the like, and the effectiveness of each respective<br>
13<br><br>
material of above as the packing material is the same.<br>
(Second Exemplary Embodiment)<br>
As shown in Fig. 2, a water holding tub cover 28 is arranged to cover the top of a water holding tub 29 and provided with a rib 28a to fit with a packing material 30 that is placed between the water holding tub cover 28 and the water holding tub 29. The packing material 30 is formed so as to have an almost U-letter like cross-section and attached to the rib 28a so as to enfold the rib 28a. The water holding tub 29 is provided with a fitting section 29a to fit with the packing material 30 at least in one direction of the vertical direction and the radial direction of the water holding tub 29. The structure of the present exemplary embodiment is the same as the one in the foregoing first exemplary embodiment in other points than the above.<br>
Accordingly, the packing material 30 and the water holding tub cover 28 are first put together and then can be assembled into the water holding tub 29 and, in addition, a washing water can be prevented from leaking not only in the vertical direction along the U-letter like shape of the packing material 30 but also in the radial direction.<br>
Thus, without any mechanical force due to an agitator and the like applied to the items to be washed in a washing-cum-dewatering tub 10 and without concerns for bursting forth, splashing and the like, a washing water can be circulated, and also the assembly work involved can be made simple.<br>
(Third Exemplary Embodiment)<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, a water holding tub cover 31 is arranged to cover the top of a water holding tub 32 and provided with a rib 31a to fit with a packing material 33 that is placed between the water holding tub cover 31 and the water holding tub<br>
14<br><br>
32. The packing material 33 is formed so as to have an almost U-letter like cross-section and attached to the rib 31a so as to enfold the rib 31a.<br>
The water holding tub 32 is provided with a fitting section 32a to fit with the packing material 33 at least in one direction of the vertical and radial directions of the water holding tub 32. Further, an almost horizontally flat section 33a is provided around the U-letter shaped portion of the packing material 33.     A surface 31b to contact the packing material 33 is provided on  the water holding   tub   cover   31   and   another   surface   32b   to   support   the packing material 33 is provided on the water holding tub 32 in such a  way  that  the  foregoing  almost horizontally  flat  section  33a  is sandwiched between the two surfaces 31b and 32b.     The structure of the present exemplary embodiment is the same as the ones in the foregoing first and second exemplary embodiments in other points than the above.<br>
Accordingly, the packing material 33 and the water holding tub cover 31 are first put together and then can be assembled into the water holding tub 32 with the packing material 33 serving as a first water blocking member to block a washing water not only in the vertical direction along the U-letter like shape but also in the radial direction and, in addition, with the almost horizontally flat section 33a of the packing material 33 located around the first water blocking member serving as a second water blocking member.<br>
Thus, even when the water holding tub 32 and water holding tub cover 31 are deformed due to vibrations caused during the processes of washing, rinsing and dewatering, a leakage of the washing water can be prevented and also the assembly work can be made simple.<br><br>
(Fourth Exemplary Embodiment)<br>
As shown in Fig. 4, a water holding tub cover 34 is arranged to cover the top of a water holding tub 35 and provided with a rib 34a to fit with a packing material 36 that is placed between the water holding tub cover 34 and the water holding tub 35. The packing material 36 is formed so as to have an almost U-letter like cross-section and attached to the rib 34a so as to enfold the rib 34a.<br>
The water holding tub 35 is provided with a fitting section 35a to fit with the packing material 36 at least in one direction of the vertical and radial directions of the water holding tub 35. Further, an almost horizontally flat section 36a is provided around the U-letter shaped portion of the packing material 36.      A surface 34b to contact the packing material  36 is provided on  the water holding   tub   cover   34   and   another   surface   35b   to   support   the packing material 36 is provided on the water holding tub 35 in such a  way  that  the  foregoing  almost  horizontally  flat  section  36a  is sandwiched between the two surfaces 34b and 35b.<br>
In addition, at least one raised rib 34c is provided on the surface 34b to contact the packing material 36 for fastening the packing material 36 intensively. The structure of the present exemplary embodiment is the same as the ones in the foregoing first to third exemplary embodiments in other points than the above.<br>
Accordingly, the packing material 36 and the water holding tub cover 34 are first put together and then can be assembled into the water holding tub 35 with the packing material 36 allowed to serve as a first water blocking member to block a washing water not only in the vertical direction along the U-letter like shape but also in the radial direction and, in addition, with the<br>
16<br><br>
almost horizontally flat section 36a of the packing material 36 serving as a second water blocking member located around the first water blocking member. Further, the raised rib 34c provided on the second water blocking member makes it possible to exert an intensive fastening force on the almost horizontally flat section 36a of the packing material 36.<br>
Thus, even when the water holding tub 35 and water holding tub cover 34 are deformed due to vibrations caused during the processes of washing, rinsing and dewatering and also the water holding tub 35 and water holding tub cover 34 are deformed due to heat caused by the use of hot water in the washing process, a leakage of the washing water can be prevented and also the assembly work can be made simple.<br>
(Fifth Exemplary Embodiment)<br>
As shown in Fig. 5, a water holding tub cover 37 is arranged to cover the top of a water holding tub 38 and a packing material 39 is disposed in the place where the water holding tub cover 37 mates with the water holding tub 38. The water holding tub 38 has an overflowed water blocking rib 38c provided around the packing material 39 and water holding tub cover 37. Further, an overflowed water draining conduit 40 is provided near the periphery of the water holding tub 38 between the overflowed water blocking rib 38c and the place where the packing material 39 is disposed.<br>
As  shown in Fig.  6,  the overflowed water draining conduit 40 is connected with a water draining conduit 41.     The structure of the present  exemplary  embodiment  is  the   same   as   the   ones   in   the foregoing first to fourth exemplary embodiments in other points than the above.<br>
Accordingly,   even   when   an   extremely   weak   leakage   of<br>
17<br><br>
water occurs through the packing material 39 due to its deterioration with time and the like, the overflowed water blocking rib 38c prevents water from spilling over out of the washing machine and the leaked water can be drained to the water draining conduit 41 through the overflowed water draining conduit 40.<br>
Therefore, a leakage of water to the outside of the washing machine can be prevented even if the washing machine has been used for many years.<br>
(Sixth Exemplary Embodiment)<br>
As shown in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8, a water holding tub cover 42 is arranged to cover the top of a water holding tub 43 and a packing material 44 is disposed in the place where the water holding tub cover 42 mates with the water holding tub 43.<br>
A water recycling wall 42d is disposed upright on the water holding tub cover 42 and the overflowed water draining conduit 40 leading to and connecting with the water draining conduit 41 is provided near the periphery of the water holding tub 43. On the water holding tub cover 42 is provided a water recycling wall guide 42e for funneling<br>
overflowed water toward the overflowed water draining conduit 40. The structure of the present exemplary embodiment is the same as the ones in the foregoing first to fifth exemplary embodiments in other points than the above.<br>
Accordingly, splashes of a washing water caused by the rotation of the washing-cum-dewatering tub 10, overflowed water caused by a malfunction of the water feeding valve 25 and the like are collected by the water recycling wall 42d and can be drained to the water draining condduit 41 through the overflowed water draining conduit 40.<br>
Therefore,  flooding due to splashes of the washing water<br><br>
caused by the rotation of the washing-cum-dewatering tub  10 and the malfunction of the water feeding valve 25 can be prevented.<br>
(Seventh Exemplary Embodiment)<br>
As shown in Fig. 9 and Fig. 10, a water holding tub cover 45 is arranged to cover the top of a water holding tub 46 and a packing material 47 is disposed in the place where the water holding tub cover 45 mates with the water holding tub 46. The water holding tub cover 45 is provided with a water guide 48 in a freely openable/closable way to introduce a washing water towards near the center of rotation of the washing-cum-dewatering tub 10. The structure of the present exemplary embodiment is the same as the ones in the foregoing first to sixth exemplary embodiments in other points than the above.<br>
Next, a description will be made on how the above structure is operated with reference to Fig. 10. When items to be washed are placed in the washing-cum-dewatering tub 10 and the washing-cum-dewatering tub 10 is rotated, upward motion is produced by centrifugal force by the rotation, thereby causing the washing water to ascend the inner surface of the water holding tub 46, and the washing water that has been ascending between the washing-cum-dewatering tub 10 and the water holding tub 46 bursts forth from the clearance between the liquid balancer 22 and the water holding tub cover 45.<br>
At this time, the discharged washing water can be introduced towards near the center of rotation of the washing-cum-dewatering tub 10 without fail by the water guide 48 installed in a freely openable/closable manner. Therefore, washing can be performed by circulating the washing water discharged by the rotation of the washing-cum-dewatering tub 10 without increasing the revolution of the washing-cum-dewatering tub 10, or increasing<br>
19<br><br>
the amount of the washing water in the water holding tub 46 or exerting the mechanical force produced by the agitator 11 onto the items to be washed.<br>
As described in the above, a washing machine according to Claim 1 of the present invention is provided with: a washing-cum-dewatering tub installed in a water holding tub so as to be made rotatable freely;<br>
a driving means for driving the foregoing washing-cum-dewatering tub; and<br>
a water holding tub cover to cover the top of the foregoing water holding tub, thereby the washing water located between the washing-cum-dewatering tub and the water holding tub being elevated and discharged from above towards near the center of rotation of the washing-cum-dewatering tub by pumping action produced by the rotational driving of the washing-cum-dewatering tub, and further provided with:<br>
a packing material such as sponge, rubber and the like placed between the water holding tub and the water holding tub cover to prevent water from spilling over. Therefore, by rotating the washing-cum-dewatering tub, the washing water can be discharged from the clearance between the washing-cum-dewatering tub and the water holding tub cover towards the inside of the washing-cum-dewatering tub and circulated, and by circulating the washing water without the use of mechanical force produced by the agitator and the like, the items to be wahsed can be cleaned without damages and tangles. In addition, by having a packing material sandwiched between the water holding tub and the waterholding tub cover as the method for blocking water, bursting forth of water, water splashing and the like can be prevented from occurring It is   noteworthy   that   discharging   the   washing   water   through   the<br>
20<br><br>
clearance between the washing-cum-dewatering tub and the water holding   tub   cover   towards   near   the   center   of   rotation   of   the washing-cum-dewatering tub allows the washing water to infiltrate into the entire items to be washed efficiently by centrifugal force. 5<br>
