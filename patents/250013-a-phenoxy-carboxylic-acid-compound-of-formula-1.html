				<td>PPAR Activating Compound and Pharmaceutical Composition Containing Same<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a PPAR activating compound which selectively activates, among peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), a-type PPAR (i.e., PPARa), and is useful as a drug for preventing and/or treating pathological conditions including hyperlipidemia, arteriosclerosis, diabetes, complications of diabetes, inflammation, and heart diseases.  The invention also relates to a pharmaceutical composition containing the compound. Background Art<br>
PPARs are known to form a family of nuclear receptors, and three sub-types thereof (a, y, 8) have already been identified (Nature, 347, 645-650, 1990; Cell, 68, pp. 879-887, 1992; Cell, 97, pp. 161-163, 1999; Biochim. Biophys. Acta., 1302, pp. 93-109, 1996; and Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 43, pp. 527-550, 2000).<br>
Among the three sub-types, PPARot is expressed predominantly in the liver and is known to be activated by plasticizeres and/or fibrates, such as Wy 14643, clofibrate, fenofibrate, bezafibrate, or gemfibrosil (Journal of the National Cancer Institute, 90, 1702-1709, 1998, Current Opinion in Lipidology, 10, pp. 245-257, 1999).<br>
In mammals, activation of PPARa is known to promote (3<br><br>
oxidation of fatty acids and lower the blood triglyceride level.  In humans, activation of PPARoc decreases levels of blood lipids such as low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol.  Thus, a PPARa-activator is useful as a drug for preventing and/or treating a disease such as hyperlipidemia. In addition, the PPARa-activator, is considered to be useful as a drug for preventing and/or treating pathological conditions such as arteriosclerosis due to increase the high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and the suppression of VCAM-1(one of cell adhesion molecules).  Furthermore, the PPARa-activator is considered to be useful as a drug for preventing and/or treating pathological conditions such as diabetes, inflammatory disease, and heart diseases (Journal of Atherosclerosis and Thrombosis, 3, pp. 81-89, 1996; Current Pharmaceutical Design, 3, pp. 1-14, 1997; Current Opinion in Lipidology, 10, pp. 151-159, 1999; Current Opinion in Lipidology, 10, pp. 245-257, 1999; The Lancet, 354, pp. 141-148, 1999; Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 43, pp. 527-550, 2000; and Journal of Cardiovascular Risk, 8, pp. 195-201, 2001).<br>
PPARy, which is expressed predominantly in adipocytes, is known to play an important role in differentiating and proliferating adipocytes.  Examples of known activators for<br>
PPARy include thiazolidine derivative drugs such as troglitazone, pioglitazone, and rosiglitazone.  These drugs are known to transform to fully-differentiated adipocytes<br>
having reduced insulin sensitivity into small adipocytes having high insulin sensitivity, to thereby improve insulin resistance (Journal of Biological Chemistry, 270, 12953-12956, 1995; Endocrinology, 137, pp. 4189-4195, 1996; Trends Endocrinol. Metab., 10, pp. 9-13, 1999; and J. Clin. Invest., 101, pp. 1354-1361, 1998).  However, activation of PPARy has been reported to have adverse effects on human to increase fat and body weight and causing obesity (The Lancet, 349, pp. 952, 1997).  Recently, it has also been reported that<br>
antagonize the PPARy possibly improves insulin resistance (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 96, pp. 6102-6106, 1999; The Journal of Biological Chemistry, 275, pp. 1873-1877, 2000; and J. Clin. Invest., 108, 1001-1013, 2001).<br>
PPAR8, which is present ubiquitously in the body, is known to take part in the lipid metabolism.  However, only a few highly selective PPARS activators have been reported, and the biological significance of PPAR5 remains unclear. At present, the structures of PPAR8 activators are reported in a wide range of literature (Diabetes, 46, 1319-1327, 1997; and Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 43, pp. 527-550, 2000).  In a recent report, a PPAR8 activator GW 501516 elevates HDL level in monkeys (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 98, pp. 5306-5311, 2001). Moreover, adipocytes or skeletal muscle cells which are<br>
expressed activated PPAR8 are reported to promote burning of fat (Cell, 113, pp. 159-170, 2003) .  However, a compound F, a PPARS activator, disclosed in WO 97/28149 has an unfavorable effect of accumulating lipids in human macrophages (Journal<br>
of Biological Chemistry, 276, pp. 44258-44265, 2001).  In addition, experiments using PPAR8-deficient mice indicate that activation of PPAR8 induces lipid accumulation (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 99, pp. 303-308, 2002).  These phenomena represent two conflicting effect in terms of the progress and alleviation of arteriosclerosis.  Thus, the significance of<br>
PPAR6 on treatment of arteriosclerosis still remains unelucidated.<br>
As described above, a PPARa-selective activator having low selectivity to PPARy and to PPAR8 is expected to be useful for preventing and/or treating, without causing obesity or increase in body weight, pathological conditions such as hyperlipidemia, arteriosclerosis, diabetes, complications of diabetes, inflammation, and heart diseases.<br>
WO  02/46176  discloses  a  PPAR  activator  having  a structure represented by the following formula:<br><br><br>

However, the compounds disclosed in WO 02/46176 act on any sub-type of PPARs (i.e., PPARa, PPARy, and PPAR5) , and thus are not regarded as PPARa-selective activators, whereas the compounds disclosed in WO 04/00762 are described to be preferably PPAR5-selective, and in consideration that no test data are provided therein, the compounds cannot regarded as<br>
being PPARot-selective.<br>

The compounds of the present invention can be obtained in accordance with,  for example,  the following production methods described in reaction schemes A to K. (in the following schemes, RI, R2, Raa, Rab, R4a/ R4b, R$, m, n, X, Y, and Z have the same meanings as described above; Rg represents a substituent which can protect hydroxyl groups such as a Ci_4 alkyl group and a trialkylsilyl group (see, for example, "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis (John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.)"); RI represents a Ci_4 alkyl group; Rj represents R^a and R^; R4 represents R4a and R4b; Hal represents a halogen atom; and p is 1 or 2).<br>
The production method represented by reaction scheme A includes the following steps: A phenol compound (a) is reacted with 2-haloalkylcarboxylic acid ester (b), to thereby produce an aldehyde compound (c); the aldehyde compound (c) is reacted with an amine compound, followed by reduction; the thus-obtained amino compound (d) is reacted with 2-<br>
halobenzoxazole, to thereby produce an ester compound (e); and the ester compound (e) is subjected to hydrolysis, to thereby produce the compound (la) of the present invention.<br>
The first step (A-l) proceeds as follows. A phenol compound (a) is dissolved in a solvent such as N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF), tetrahydrofuran (THF), dioxane, or acetonitrile. A necessary amount of an inorganic base such as potassium carbonate (K2C03) , sodium carbonate (Na2C03) , or cesium carbonate (Cs2COs) or an organic base such as triethylamine or diisopropylethylamine is added thereto. Further, a necessary amount of a 2-haloalkylcarboxylic acid ester (b) such as 2-bromoisobutyric acid ester, 2-bromo-n-butyric acid ester, or 2-bromopropionic acid ester is added, and the resultant mixture is allowed to react at a temperature between room temperature and around the boiling point of the solvent under stirring for several hours to 24 hours.  The ester is appropriately selected from among tert-butyl esters, ethyl esters, methyl esters, etc.<br>
In the second step (A-2), the aldehyde compound (c) is dissolved in a solvent such as 1,2-dichloroethane, chloroform, dichloromethane, DMF, THF, dioxane, or acetonitrile. Subsequently, a suitably selected amine compound and an acid such as acetic acid are added, followed by reduction with a reducing agent such as sodium triacetoxyborohydride (NaBH(OAc)3) .  The reaction is carried out by stirring the mixture under cooling or at room temperature for several hours to 24 hours (in an inert gas atmosphere, if necessary).<br>
The third step (A-3) proceeds as follows.  The starting amino compound (d) is dissolved in a solvent such as DMF, THF, dioxane, or acetonitrile.  2-Halobenzoxazole such as 2-chlorobenzoxazole is added thereto in the presence of a necessary amount of an inorganic base such as K2C03, Na2C03, or Cs2CC&gt;3 or an organic base such as triethylaraine or diisopropylethylamine.

The fifth step (J-5) proceeds as follows.  In the case where R7 forms a methyl ester, an ethyl ester, or any ester that is easily hydrolyzed with an alkali, the ester compound is dissolved in a solvent such as methanol, ethanol, or THF; a base such as lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, or potassium hydroxide, or an aqueous solution thereof is added thereto; and the mixture is allowed to react for several hours to 24 hours under cooling, or at a temperature between room temperature and around the boiling point of the solvent.<br><br>

Test Example 1<br>
PPAR activating effects of the compounds of the present invention represented by formula (1) and comparative compounds disclosed in WO 02/46176 (hereinafter referred to<br>
as compounds A, B, and C) were determined through the following method (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 92, pp. 7297-7301, 1995; Journal of Lipid Research, 40, pp. 2099-2110, 1999; and Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, 98, pp. 5306-5311, 2001). Compound A<br>
Measurement methods Transfection assay<br>
COS-7 cells, which is African green monkey kidney cell line, were used for all transfection assays. Cells were cultured in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, glutamic acid, and an antibiotic under humidified 5% C02 atmosphere.<br>
Cells were transfected by lipofectamine reagent with a mixture containing expression plasmid, firefly luciferase reporter plasmid. And a p-galactosidase expression plasmid used as an internal control for transfection efficiency. The each expression vector contained Gal4 DNA-binding domain, which is yeast transcription factor and human PPARoc(166-467aa), y(182-505aa) or 8(137-441aa) ligand binding domain.<br>
Transiently transfected cells were incubated with DMEM with 0.2% FCS with or without compound. And after 16 hours, luciferase activity and p-galactosidase activity of cell lysate were measured.<br>
Each compound was dissolved in and diluted with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and the DMSO concentration of the DMEM medium (containing 0.2% serum) was adjusted to 0.1% upon treatment of cells. The positive control compounds employed are WY 14643, troglitazone (Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 43, pp. 527-550, 2000), and GW 501516 (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 98, pp. 5306-5311, 2001) for PPARoc, PPARy, and PPAR6, respectively.<br>
Table  9  shows  agonist  activity  (to hPPARa,  hPPARy,<br>
hPPAR5) of the compounds of the present invention and the comparative Compound. Table 9<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The hPPARoc selectivities of compounds A and B were found to be low, and specifically, their levels are only less than 10-fold at EC50 values.  In addition, compound C was found to exhibit no activation of any hPPAR isoform.  In contrast, the compounds of the present invention exhibited excellent hPPARa selectivity, clearly revealing that the compounds of the present invention have high hPPARa selectivity as compared with compounds A, B, and C disclosed in WO 02/46176.<br>
Figs. 1 to 5 show activation factors, with respect to each hPPAR isoform, of the compounds of the present invention (Examples 1 and 2) and the comparative compounds (compounds A, B, and C) as determined at corresponding EC50 values in<br>
activation of hPPARa and at concentrations 10 times those of ECso values.  The activation factor is defined as a ratio of activity of test compound to that of control, which contains only the solvent (DMSO) and no test compound. As is clear from these Figures, the compounds of Examples 1 and 2<br>
exhibited substantially no activation of hPPARy and hPPAR8 even at the 10-fold concentration of EC5o value in activation<br>
of hPPARa, while compounds A and B strongly activate hPPARy and hPPARS at the 10-fold concentration of EC50 value in activation of hPPARa.  Compound C was found to have activated<br>
no hPPAR isoform.  The results indicate that the compounds of<br>
the present invention can be used as excellent hPPARoc-selective activators.<br><br><br><br><br>
