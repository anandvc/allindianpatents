				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a system for defining a plurality of work zones within an otherwise open area. In particular, this invention relates to a utilities and furniture system adapted to simultaneous multi-purpose uses and, at the same time, capable of providing easy changeover to a plurality of configurations and uses.<br>
Because the concept of what is considered an appropriate working environment is rapidly changing, it is necessary that any system of arranging and defining work areas be capable of many different configurations allowing rapid changeover from one arrangement to another. Such systems must be flexible enough to accommodate different work activities and tools. In addition, such systems must be easily assembled or reconfigured into a plurality of space efficient plans.<br>
Previous systems have failed to adequately provide a flexible and efficient use of an open area workspace. For example, it has been known to erect permanent or semi-permanent space dividing walls and then to furnish each individual work area created by these walls with furniture. The furniture used in these systems has been of the conventional type, entirely or substantially independent of the walls. Such arrangements were tolerable under circumstances in which the requirements of the activities performed within the work spaces remained relatively static over long periods of time.<br>
Open plan office systems or systems furniture typically provide a series of rigid panels which are in turn rigidly connected together at facing edges to divide work spaces into work or task areas. The panels are coupled together at facing edges for straight lane rectangular coupling. Vertical slots are provided at the facing edges to support brackets for hanging cabinets, shelves and work surfaces to efficiently use the space.<br><br>
Although systems furniture remains a viable solution for many office environments, some business organizations have functional and esthetic requirements which cannot be practically or commercially met by such a product.  In particular, the increasing use of computer equipment and worl
The use of built-in or semi-built-in space dividing systems and of conventional system furniture immediately creates a problem when a change is to be made. The cost and time requirements of changing the space divider systems is often so great that necessary and desirable changes frequently are not made. Furniture of the conventional type is static in design, often usable only for a single purpose. When not in use, conventional furniture is bulky and requires substantial storage space.<br>
In addition, most previous systems could only be organized into a limited number of rectilinear patterns because they were based upon a format whereby panels, and work surfaces line up at 90 degree comers.   As a result, the number of work areas within an open space can be limited. The rectilinear construction can also create a lot of unusable space because of its shape. Lastly, both the space separation means and the furnishings, are often used long after they have attained functional obsolescence because of the cost of reorganization and replacement.<br>
Therefore, there is a need for a system that defines work areas capable of efficiently organizing workers within a flexible work area while being easily assembled or reorganized.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to an improved assembly that provides an increased efficiency and flexibility over previous open plan furniture systems.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a system for defining a plurality of work zones within an otherwise open area comprising; a framework formed from a plurality of spaced apart poles extending upward from a base surface, the poles interconnected by a plurality of crossbeams at a height substantially above a standing user, at least some of the poles adapted to provide a raceway for the delivery of utilities, the framework capable of being arranged in a plurality of substantially nonÂ¬linear patterns and including an at least partially open area between adjacent poles and a plurality of substantially nonrigid barrier members extending between at least some of the plurality of spaced apart poles.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, a system for defining a plurality of work zones within an otherwise open area is provided. The system includes a framework formed from a plurality of spaced apart poles extending upward from a base surface with an at least partially open area defined between adjacent poles. The poles are interconnected by a plurality of crossbeams at a height substantially above a standing user. At least some of the poles and crossbeams are adapted to provide a raceway for the delivery of power and data cabling. The framework is capable of being configured in a plurality of nonlinear patterns in order to form a work area for a group of users.<br>
According to yet another aspect of the invention, a work space management and furniture system is provided. The system includes a plurality of spaced apart poles extending upward from a base surface with an at least partially open area defined between adjacent poles. The poles are interconnected by a plurality of crossbeams. The crossbeams are adapted to be attached to the poles such that most groups of two crossbeams form an obtuse angle. At least some of the poles and crossbeams are attached to a<br><br>
work environment element selected from the group consisting of: work surfaces, storage members, monitor support members, and dividing screens.<br>

The invention is described with reference to the drawings in which like elements are referred to by like numerals. The relationship and functioning of the various elements of this invention are better understood by the following detailed description. However, the embodiments of this invention as described below are by way of example only, and the invention is not limited to the embodiments illustrated in the drawings. It should also be understood that the drawings are not to scale and in certain instances details have been omitted which are not necessary for an understanding of the present invention such as conventional details of fabrication and assembly.<br>
The present invention is directed to a unique system 10 that divides up space into a plurality of work areas 12. Floor mats 14 are used to assist in the installation of the system 10 and to define personal space for each user.   A three-dimensional framework 16 including poles 18 and crossbeams 22, 24 separates the space for each user and provides for the distribution of utilities. Once assembled, the system 10 is self-supporting and does not depend on architecture or interior design elements of the space for stability. The system 10 is an open-end system adding a geometry formed primarily on the use of a 120-degree angle. The 120-degree angle provides the most economical and structurally sound geometry for the connection of poles 18 and crossbeams 22, 24. The system 10 is capable of creating a plurality of workspaces of identical characteristics or unique characteristics and is also extremely effective in achieving high room densities for users.<br><br>
The system 10 is also characterized by a novel ability to be easily moved, changed or restyled without removing or disconnecting the mainframe work. The system 10 is designed and engineered to be sufficiently lightweight such that it can be carried and moved by one installer.<br>
By way of example, the system 10 illustrated in the figures defines a plurality of work areas 12. The work areas 12 can be at least partially defined by the floor mats 14. The floor mats 14 help with installation by aiding the layout of the floor plan of the office. The floor mats 14 also help by defining personal work areas for the users. The floor mats 14 can also be constructed from resilient and sound absorbing material.<br>
Adjacent the floor mats 14 is the framework 16 that interconnects adjacent work areas and forms the basis for the system 10. The framework 16 includes a plurality of vertically extending poles 18 extending upward from base members 20. A plurality of crossbeams such as the upper crossbeam 22 and the lower crossbeam 24 interconnect adjacent poles 18. The upper crossbeam 22 includes trough 26 through which utilities pass. The connection of crossbeams 22, 24 to poles 18 is at the pre-defined 120-degree angle. This self-defined, angular orientation provides for unique capabilities such as the use of space by a large number of users as well as creating a relatively easy installation process.<br>
An aesthetic cover 30 may be attached to an upper portion 32 of the pole 18- A movable canopy 34 and rotatable canopy 36 may also be attached to the upper portion 32 of the pole 18. The canopies 34 and 36 are capable of providing privacy or openness depending on their positioning. In areas having high ceiling spaces, they also help to bring the work area 12 to a more human sized perspective. Moreover, the canopies 34, 36 can provide an acousfical barrier for the workspace and neutralize screen glares from monitors.<br><br>
With particular reference to the room 36 as illustrated in Fig. 1B, an upper crossbeam 22 may also be attached to a barrier member 40. The illustrated barrier member 40 includes centrally positioned apertures 42. The lower crossbeams 24 as illustrated in the figures may also include barrier members 46. The barrier members 40,46 can provide various functions such as privacy, sound adsorption or storage features through the use of Velcro and connection members. Optionally, the barrier members 46 may be translucent, porous to air and include an aperture 48. Another preferred barrier member 49 is illustrated in Fig. 1C.<br>
The lower crossbeams 24 may also be used for attachment to storage members 52, 54 and 56. An arm 58 Is attached to the lower crossbeam 24 and extends outward therefrom. The storage members 52, 54 and 56 are attached in a manner such that they may be rotated by the user to a selected position. Other accessory elements may be attached to the crossbeams 22 and 24. A plurality of work surfaces 60 are shown attached to the poles 18. With particular reference to the work surface arrangement 64 illustrated in Figure 1B. the work surfaces 60 may be attached to short poles 68 having a height substantially less than the pole 18. The work surface 60 has a curved front edge 70. The rear edge 72 is angled to generally form a 120 degree angle. The 120 degree angle conforms with the 120 degree angle that is defined by any two crossbeams 22,24 or a group of three poles 18.<br>
A movable work surface 80 is illustrated In Figure 1A. The movable work surface 80 is adjustable both vertically and angulariy. The movable work surface 80 allows the user to customize the movable work surface 80 to his or her body type and to the type of work being conducted. In particular, the movable work surface 80 is capable of supporting a keyboard and mouse or other work area implements such as a pen and paper. The movable nature of the work surface 80 allows the user to be at a distance and a viewing angle from a monitor and therefore provides a unique freedom and mobility. The preferred embodiment includes a shape such ths" it follows the contours of a user"s body. When unused, the<br><br>
movable work surface 80 can be easily be stored under a larger work surface 60. In the alternative, multiple movable work surfaces 80 may be grouped together to form a larger meeting table. An alternate moveable work surface embodiment 82 is illustrated in Fig. 1C.<br>
The poles 18 provide for the distribution of utilities such to the power receptacles 84 or data lines 88. The system 10 also provides for an easy access to utilities from walls, ceilings, floors or other elements. The utilities can be easily routed anywhere within the system to serve the needs of a particular user. Commercial power cabling and connectors useful with the system 10 are available from sources such Pent Inc. of Kendallvitle, Ind.<br>
Again referring to the room 36, a monitor lift 90 is also illustrated. The monitor lift 90 is preferably attached to the pole 18.   Monitor lifts can be used within the system 10 of the present Invention which are not attached to a pole 18. Monitor lifts as shown in Figs. 17-24 enable a worker to use a computer and monitor setup without the need for a horizontal work surface. Alternatively, a monitor lift can be incorporated within a work surface 60 such that a greater surface area of the work surface 60 is available to the user (see Figs. 21-24). Monitor lifts can be either free standing or anchored to the framework. Monitor lifts can also allow for rotation to different display angles. The adjustment feature on the monitor lifts allows the user to work from a variety of positions including both sitting and standing.<br>
Figs. 1D-E also illustrate moveable barrier member 104. The moveable barrier member 104 can be rolled to a wide variety of positions in order to substantially or partially enclose a work area 12.<br>
Figs. 2A through 2XX illustrate a plurality of different configurations that the system 10 may be arranged to provide. In these figures, the floor mats 14, work surfaces 16, poles 18, crossbeams 22 and short poles 68 are illustrated. Figures 2A through 21 illustrate a plurality of zig-zag configurations capable of supporting three or less users to greater than five users. Figures<br><br>
2J-2R illustrate various delta configurations capable of providing work areas for two or less users to five or more users. Figures 2S through 2W illustrate a double delta configuration capable of providing work areas for four or less users to 15 or more users. Figures 2X through 2EE illustrate a plurality of room configurations identical or similar to the room 36 illustrated in Fig. 1B. The room configurations are capable of providing a work area for one to six or more users. Figures 2NN to 2W illustrate a plurality of single sided constellations capable of providing work areas for one to ten or more users. Figures 2WW and 2XX are two additional room configurations capable of providing work areas for six or more users.<br>
Fig. 3 illustrates a side view of a preferred embodiment of the pole 18. An upper portion 32 of the pole 18 has a plurality of parallel spaced apart apertures 150, and a plurality of holes 152 are positioned between the apertures 150. With particular reference to the enlarged view of Figure 4, two rows of six apertures 150 are positioned within the channel 156. Centrally positioned within the channel 156 are the apertures 152 which are adapted to receive a conventional fastening mechanism such as a screw. This pattern is repeated at a central portion 160 of the pole and then at a lower portion 152. An enlarged grouping of the apertures 150 is located between the lower portion 1S2 and the central portion 160. The enlarged grouping 170 takes the same general configuration as shown in Figure 4 except that the number of apertures 150 and holes 152 are substantially increased. The pole 18 includestlliÂ»ee generally concave or inwardly curved outer surfaces 176. Apertures 180 are formed within the outer surfaces 176 for the delivery of a power cdide to a power receptacle 84. The pattern of apertures 150, holes 152 andoifljenings 180 are symmetrically repeated around the pole 18.<br>
I%.5 illustrates an attachment bracket 200 for use with the pole 18. The attaSment bracket 200 includes a plurality of hook shaped members 202 which anEMzed to be received within one column of the parallel apertures 150. The tracket 200 is a two-part element secured together using a conventiamal fastening mechanism at the clip portion 208.<br><br>
With particular reference to Fig. 6 a one-piece pole construction 18 is illustrated through the cross-section shown therein. The outer surface 176 is a generally curved form. Channels 156 are arranged such that crossbeams 22 or 24 attached therein form a 120 degree angle. The channels 156 have a dovetail configuration which becomes wider within an interior portion 210 thereof. A centrally defined opening 212 extends vertically within the pole 18. The pole in this and the following embodiments can be formed from a wide variety of materials e.g., steel or aluminum and using various well known processes such as the preferred roll forming and extnjsion.<br>
Fig. 7 illustrates a three-piece embodiment of the pole 220. The pole 220 is characterized by three pieces 222, 224. 226 which take the same general configuration as the one-piece embodiment shown in Fig. 6, except that the channels 156 are defined by two oppositely extending walls that are secured together to form channel 230. Preferably, the poles 18 and 220 are formed from cold rolled steel.<br>
Fig. 7A illustrates a two piece embodiment of the pole 240. The pole 240 includes a first piece 242 and a second piece 244. The piece 244 includes ends 246 that are attached to the ends 248 of the piece 242 by welding or the like.<br>
Fig. 8 is a partially broken-away view of the upper crossbeam 22 and the trough 26. The upper crossbeam 22 includes a longitudinally extending lower round tube 250 that extends from a first side 252 to a second side 254. The tube 250 is attached to the hanger members 256, 258. The hanger members 256, 258 include a plurality of hook-shaped members 260 which are sized to mate with the apertures 150 in the pole 18. The hangers 260 include openings 264 that are capable of receiving a conventional fastening mechanism such as a screw which can pass into one of the holes 152. An upper round tube 270 includes an angularly upwardly-extending portion 272 that meets with the trough 26.<br>
Figs. 9-11 illustrate a telescoping and pivoting crossbeam and trough assembly 280. With particular reference to the exploded view shown in Fig.<br><br>
10, the telescoping crossbeam 280 includes a hanger 282 having hook portions 284 pivotably attached to a bracket 290 {the opposite sides of the assembly have an Identical construction). A pin 292 interconnects the hanger 282 to the bracket 290. A lower tube 294 extends outward from a lower portion 296 of the bracket 290. A lower intermediate tube 300 is sized such that It can fit within the circumference of the lower tube 294. An upper tube 304 extends outward and upward from an upper portion 306 of the bracket 290. End portion of the trough 308 are secured to the top of the upper tube 304. An upper intermediate tube 310 is sized to fit within the upper tube 304. An intermediate trough portion 314 is sized to fit within the end trough portions 308. A broken-away assembled view of the telescoping crossbeam 280 is illustrated in Fig. 9. Fig. 11 is an enlarged view of the hanger 282 and the bracket 290 with the upper tube 304 and the lower tube 294 attached thereto.<br>
The telescoping crossbeam 280 is assembled by sliding the end tubes 294 and 304 out from engagement with the end tubes formed on the opposite piece.
