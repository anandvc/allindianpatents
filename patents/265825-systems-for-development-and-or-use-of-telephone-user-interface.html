COPYRIGHT STATEMENT<br>
A portion of the disclosure of this patent document contains material<br>
which is subject to copyright protection. The copyright owner has no objection<br>
to the facsimile reproduction by any one of the patent document or the patent<br>
disclosure, as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent file or<br>

BACKGROUND<br>
Conventional telephones typically receive user input via the ubiquitous<br>
numeric keypad. In the most basic arrangement, a user requests a telephone<br>
connection with a remote party by dialing the remote party's telephone<br>
number using the keys of such a keypad. A conventional telephone keypad<br>
may include letters associated with each key in order to enable input of alpha<br>
characters.<br>
Interactive voice response (IVR) systems attempt to address the<br>
limitations of the conventional keypad in order to provide a more sophisticated<br>
exchange between a telephone user and a remote system. In particular, IVR<br>
systems provide audible menus which a user may navigate by depressing<br><br>
keypad keys. Most users, however, find IVR systems to be frustrating and<br>
inefficient for all but the simplest of tasks.<br>
Modem telephone systems may provide a small display screen in<br>
addition to the traditional keypad. The screen may display information typed<br>
by a user using the keypad and/or other information such as date and time. In<br>
some instances, the screen may provide labels for soft keys having functions<br>
that vary depending on operating context.<br>
Systems are desired for efficiently providing telephone users with a<br>
useful interface. Such a system may be customizable and/or sufficiently<br>
inexpensive to manufacture.<br>
According to various embodiments, the invention generally relates to<br>
systems to provide user interfaces for telephone systems. More particularly,<br>
some embodiments are concerned with systems to generate and/or support<br>
customizable telephone interface layouts.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Some embodiments provide a system, method, telephone, program<br>
code and/or means to receive a first user indication of a telephone interface<br>
control, receive a second user indication of a location associated with the<br>
telephone interface control, receive a third user indication of an action<br>
associated with the telephone interface control,, and generate, based on the<br>
first user indication, the second user indication, and the third user indication, a<br>
telephone interface layout formatted according to a markup language and<br>
usable by a telephone to provide a user interface.<br>
In further aspects, the telephone interface layout comprises an image<br>
depicting a plurality of telephone interface controls and data associating one<br>
or more of the plurality of telephone interface controls with a respective<br>
location and a respective action. The image may be depicted on a printed<br>
medium.<br>
According to some embodiments, a system includes a touch-sensitive<br>
device to receive a bias and to generate touch location information based on<br><br>
the bias, an element to secure a printed medium in contact with the touch<br>
sensitive device, the printed medium to depict a plurality of telephone<br>
interface controls, and a memory to store a telephone interface layout<br>
associating one or more of the telephone interface controls with a respective<br>
touch location and a respective action. Also included may be a processor to<br>
receive touch location information from the touch-sensitive device, to<br>
determine a telephone interface control based on the touch location<br>
information and on the telephone interface layout, to determine an action<br>
based on the telephone interface control and on the telephone interface<br>
layout, and to perform the determined action.<br>
Some aspects may provide reception of touch location information from<br>
a touch-sensitive device, and determination of a telephone interface control<br>
based on the touch location information and on a telephone interface layout.<br>
The telephone interface layout may be formatted according to a markup<br>
language and may associate one or more of the telephone interface controls<br>

first user indication, the second user indication, and the third user indication.<br>
The telephone interface layout may be formatted according to a markup<br>
language and usable by a telephone to provide a user interface.<br>
Computing system 110 of FIG. 1 includes processor 111 in<br>
communication with communication bus 112. Processor 111 may comprise<br>
any controller or processor capable of executing program code. More<br>
specifically, processor 111 executes program code to control the elements of<br>
computing system 110 to provide desired functionality such as that described<br>
above.<br>
Also in communication with communication bus 112 are input device<br>
113 and display 114. A user may manipulate input device 113 to transmit a<br>
user indication to system 110. Such an indication may indicate one or more<br>
of a telephone interface control, a Iocation associated with the telephone<br>
interface control, and an action associated with the telephone interface<br>
control. Input device 113 may comprise any known input device, including a<br>
keyboard, mouse, touch pad, voice-recognition system, or any combination of<br>
these devices.<br>
Display 114 may display graphics and text in response to commands<br>
issued by processor 112. The displayed graphics and text may comprise a<br>
user interface of an application for designing telephone interface layouts. In<br>
this regard, display 114 may display a telephone interface layout to be used<br>
by telephone 130 as will be described below. Display 114 may comprise an<br>
integral or separate CRT display, flat-panel display or the like.<br>
Data storage device 115 is also coupled to bus 112 and stores, among<br>
other data, processor-executable program code of layout manager application<br>
116. Processor 111 may execute the program code in order to control<br>
computing system 110 to generate a telephone interface layout according to<br>
some embodiments. Such a generated telephone interface layout may be<br>
stored among telephone interface layouts 117 of storage device 115.<br>
Computing system 110 according to some embodiments may include<br>
fewer or more elements arranged differently than illustrated in FIG. 1. In<br>
some embodiments, system 110 includes a printer for outputting a printed<br><br>
medium depicting an image of a plurality of telephone interface controls.<br>
Computing system 110 may also or alternatively include a communication port<br>
for transmitting data to and receiving data from devices external to computer<br>
system 110. Such a communication port may transmit telephone interface<br>
layout 125 to telephone 130 over link 120 according to some embodiments.<br>
The program code of layout manager application 116 may be read from<br>
a computer-readable medium, such as a floppy disk, a CD-ROM, a DVD-<br>
ROM, a Zip™ disk, a magnetic tape, or a signal encoding the process steps,<br>
and then stored in data storage device 115 in a compressed, uncompiled<br>
and/or encrypted format. In alternative embodiments, hard-wired circuitry<br>
may be used in place of, or in combination with, processor-executable code<br>
for implementation of processes according to some embodiments. Thus,<br>
embodiments are not limited to any specific combination of hardware and<br>
software.<br>
Communication link 120 may comprise any one or more suitable media<br>
for transmitting telephone interface layout 125 to telephone 130.<br>
Communication link may support any suitable communication protocol(s). In<br>
some embodiments, link 120 may comprise a USB cable, a serial cable, a<br>
network cable, and/or a wireless link. In a case that telephone interface<br>
layout 125 comprises a printed medium, link 120 may comprise the physical<br>
means by which the medium is delivered to telephone 130.<br>
Telephone 130 may operate in some embodiments to receive touch<br>
location information from a touch-sensitive device, and determine a telephone<br>
interface control based on the touch location information and on a telephone<br>
interface layout. The telephone interface layout may be formatted according<br>
to a markup language and may associate one or more of the telephone<br>
interface controls with a respective touch location and a respective action.<br>
Telephone 130 may determine an action based on the telephone interface<br>
control and on the telephone interface layout, and may proceed to perform the<br>
determined action.<br>
Telephone 130 of FIG. 1 includes touch-sensitive device 132. Touch-<br>
sensitive device 132 may operate according to some embodiments to receive<br><br><br>
a bias and to generate touch location information based on the bias. Touch-<br>
sensitive device 132 may comprise any type of suitable device that is<br>
currently or hereafter known. Touch-sensitive device 132 may comprise a<br>
simple touch-sensitive panel, a touch-sensitive panel providing a controllable<br>
display on its surface, and/or a panel capable of providing haptic feedback to<br>
a user. In this regard, haptic feedback comprises a force delivered by device<br>
132 to a user of telephone 130. The force may simulate the "click" of a<br>
keypress, a buzzing sensation, or any other suitable phenomena. As will be<br>
described in detail below, some embodiments provide customizable haptic<br>
feedback based on generated touch location information.<br>
Touch-sensitive device 132 may be equipped with an integral display<br>
for displaying depictions of a plurality of telephone interface controls. The<br>
depictions may comprise elements of a telephone interface layout received<br>
from computing system 110. Accordingly, the telephone interface layout<br>
comprises an image file that may be displayed by the integral display of<br>
touch-sensitive device 132.<br>
Alternatively, some embodiments of telephone 130 may include<br>
element 134 to secure a printed medium in contact with device 132. Such a<br>
printed medium, some embodiments of which will be described below, may<br>
depict the aforementioned plurality of telephone interface controls. The<br>
printed medium may therefore be considered part of a telephone interface<br>
layout that is associated with the plurality of telephone interface controls.<br>
Accordingly, a user may touch a telephone interface control displayed<br>
by the integral display or presented on a printed medium secured by securing<br>
element 134. In response, touch-sensitive device 132 generates location<br>
information associated with a location at which the touch is sensed.<br>
In this regard, telephone 130 also includes memory 134 to store<br>
program code of a telephone application and at least one telephone interface<br>
layout associating one or more of the telephone interface controls with a<br>
respective touch location. The telephone interface layout may also associate<br>
one or more of the telephone interface controls with a respective action.<br>
The following description provides an example of operation of system<br><br>
100 according to some embodiments. A user may initially exert a bias against<br>
one of the telephone interface controls displayed by the integral display or<br>
depicted by the printed medium. Device 132 may, in response, generate<br>
touch location information corresponding to a location of the telephone<br>
interface control against which the bias is exerted.<br>
Processor 138 of telephone 130 may execute the program code of<br>
memory 134 to receive the touch location information from touch-sensitive<br>
device 132. Based on a telephone interface layout stored in memory 134,<br>
processor 138 may determine a telephone interface control associated with<br>
the touch location information. Processor 138 may then determine, also<br>
based on the telephone interface layout, an action associated with the<br>
telephone interface control. Lastly, processor 138 controls elements of<br>
telephone 130 to perform the determined action.<br>
The elements of system 100 may include many unshown elements to<br>
provide necessary or optional features. These elements may be embodied by<br>
any suitable combinations of hardware, software and/or firmware, and may<br>
share some elements therebetween. Computing system 110 and telephone<br>
130 may be located adjacent to or remote from one another, and may be<br>
elements of a single apparatus. Either or both of computing system 110 and<br>
telephone 130 may be embodied by several devices located adjacent to or<br>
remote from one another.<br>
FIG. 2 is a flow diagram of process 200 according to some<br>
embodiments. Process 200, as well as the other processes described herein,<br>
may be embodied in program code executed by a processor or using any<br>
suitable hardware and/or software arrangement. Process 200 is described<br>
below as executed by computing system 110, but may be executed by any<br>
suitable device or devices that are or become known.<br>
Process 200 may comprise process steps embodied in program code.<br>
Accordingly, prior to process 200, a user may operate computing system 110<br>
to launch an application including such program code. In some embodiments,<br>
process 200 is initiated by launching layout manager application 116 of<br>
storage device 115.<br><br><br>
According to some embodiments, display 114 displays user interface<br>
300 of FIG. 3 upon launching layout manager application 116. User interface<br>
300 includes design panel 310 for displaying graph/oaf elements of a<br>
telephone interface layout, toolbox 320 for selecting widgets for inclusion in a<br>
telephone interface layout, drop-down menu 330 for selecting a telephone<br>
model in which the telephone interface layout is intended to be used, and<br>
options 340 for performing associated tasks.<br>
Initially, at step 210, an indication of a telephone interface control is<br>
received. The first user indication may comprise user selection of a widget of<br>
toolbox 320. For example, the Button widget may represent a selectable<br>
button or a rectangle of a telephone interface layout, the Label may represent<br>
text to include in the telephone interface fayout, the Handwriting Recognition<br>
widget may represent an area in which handwriting may be input, and the<br>
ImageBox widget may provide an area to include a selectable image.<br>
Next, an indication of a location is received at step 220. The received<br>
indication is associated with the telephone interface control indicated at step<br>
210. Any number of systems for inputting and receiving the location indication<br>
may be employed at step 220. For example, the user may "drag and drop" a<br>
selected widget from toolbox 320 to a location of design panel 310. Step 220<br>
therefore comprises determining the location to which the widget was<br>
dropped. The dropped widget may be aligned within design panel 310 using<br>
a "snap to grid" feature.<br>
At step 230, it is determined whether the telephone interface control is<br>
to be associated with an action. If so, flow proceeds to step 240, at which an<br>
indication of an action associated with a telephone interface control is<br>
received. The indication of the action may be input and/or received in any<br>
suitable manner. According to some embodiments of step 240, a user may<br>
select a displayed telephone interface control and may then select Properties<br>
button of options 340. In response, display 114 may display property sheet<br>
400 of FIG. 4, which the user may manipulate to indicate an action associated<br>
with the selected telephone interface control.<br>
As shown, property sheet 400 allows a user to specify any number of<br><br>
parameters associated with a telephone interface control. Specific to step<br>
240, window 400 provides text boxes 405 and 410 for specifying an action<br>
type and an action value, respectively. The action type and action value<br>
define an action that will be performed upon user selection of the associated<br>
telephone interface control. For example, an ImageBox telephone interface<br>
control may be associated with an action name "Dial" and an action number<br>
"18004278427". Accordingly, a telephone displaying the telephone interface<br>
control may dial the number upon user selection of the control.<br>
Property sheet 400 may also be used to input and receive an indication<br>
of a touch feedback parameter associated with the subject telephone interface<br>
control. Specifically, area 415 of window 400 allows a user to associate touch<br>
feedback parameters with the telephone interface control defined by property<br>
sheet 400. The touch feedback parameters may define a haptic feedback to<br>
be delivered to a user upon selection of the telephone interface control.<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 4, some embodiments may allow a user to<br>
manipulate any number of relevant parameter values with a telephone<br>
interface control. These parameters may include, but are not limited to, a<br>
size, a color, an image fife, text, and optica/ character recognition parameters<br>
(e.g. an IP address and port number of a handwriting recognition server). The<br>
types of parameters associated with a telephone interface control may<br>
depend on the type of the telephone interface control. For exampie, Text<br>
widgets might not be associated with an action and/or touch feedback<br>
parameters.<br>
Flow returns to step 210 if it is determined at step 260 that a user<br>
intends to define additional telephone interface controls. If not, an indication<br>
of a target telephone model is received at step 270. Returning to FIG. 3, the<br>
indication of the target telephone model may be received via drop-down box<br>
330. As will be described below, dimensions of the target telephone model<br>
may be used to determine dimensions of telephone interface controls of a<br>
subsequently-generated telephone interface layout.<br>
At step 280, a telephone interface layout formatted according to a<br>
markup language is generated. The layout associates all indicated telephone<br><br><br>
interface controls with their respective indications received at steps 220, 240<br>
and 250, and may be scaled based on the indicated target telephone mode).<br>
A telephone interface layout according to some embodiments may include<br>
data providing the associations mentioned above, as well as displayable<br>
graphics data and/or a printed medium depicting the telephone interface<br>
controls.<br>
According to some embodiments, step 280 begins in response to user<br>
selection of one of the Print Preview, Print Layout or Save Layout buttons of<br>
options 340. The images within design panel 310 is measured in pixels and<br>
may be scaled to millimeters for both saving the layout in markup language<br>
format and for printing a depiction of the layout, if needed. For example, the<br>
selected optiPoint 410 telephone includes a touch pad measuring 112mm in<br>
width x 131mm in height. Assuming a fixed height of 512 pixels, the width of<br>
the panel is calculated as 112mm/131mm * 512 pixels = 438 pixels.<br>
Next, a snapshot of the images within design panel 310 is obtained<br>
using a BitBIt (Bit Block Transfer) function. The function creates a bitmap<br>
image by moving a rectangular block of bits from the display memory into<br>
Random Access Memory of system 110. A frame (e.g. a Graphics object in<br>
C++) is then built to hold the bitmap image. This frame is mapped in<br>
millimeters and stretches or shrinks the bitmap image to maintain the proper<br>
dimensions.<br>
The code snippet below sets forth one strategy to convert the<br>
telephone interface layout from pixels to millimeters. According to the code,<br>
each specified telephone interface control (i.e. widget) is stored in an array<br>
"widgets") and is iterated using a for-each loop. The location and the<br>
dimensions of each widget are calculated by determining the ratio between its<br>
width in millimeters and its width in pixels, and by multiplying the ratio with the<br>
property to be transformed, e.g. the location of the widget in the x-direction.<br>
Widgetlnfoll widgetlnfoList = new WidgetInfo[widgets.Count];<br>
Widgetlnfo widgetlnfo; //contains all information about a widget<br><br><br>
The markup language-formatted telephone interface layout includes<br>
two main parts according to some embodiments. A first part holds general<br>
information associated with the target telephone, and a second part contains<br>
an array of a plurality of telephone interface controls. The following is an<br>
example of the above-described first part of a layout according to some<br>
embodiments.<br><br><br><br><br>
The second part of markup language-formatted telephone interface<br>
layout may list each telephone interface control of the layout, and may also<br>
associate one or more of a location, dimensions, an action, and touch<br>
feedback with each control. The following example includes information<br>
relating to two telephone interface controls (i.e., widgets).<br><br><br><br><br>
According to some embodiments, the location information association<br>
with a telephone interface control may represent areas of a touchscreen<br>
surrounding the telephone interface control. Therefore, user depression of<br>
one of these surrounding areas may be considered a selection of the<br>
corresponding interface control. Such embodiments may be beneficial for<br>
elderly users.<br>
As mentioned above, some embodiments of process 200 generate a<br>
telephone interface layout including a printed medium depicting a plurality of<br>
telephone interface controls and a markup language-formatted data file<br>
associating each of the plurality of interface controls with a location, etc. In<br><br><br>
some embodiments, the data file includes information that may be used by an<br>
electronic display to generate an image of the telephone interface controls.<br>
Such information may comprise a jpg image, an HTML page, or the like. In<br>
some embodiments, a target telephone may include a rendering engine for<br>
reading the above-described XML file in order to display the telephone<br>
interface controls of the layout.<br>
FIG. 5 is a diagram of process 500 according to some embodiments.<br>
Process 500 may be executed by a telephone such as, but not limited to,<br>
telephone 130 of FIG. 1. Process 500 may be embodied in processor-<br>
executable program code and may therefore be stored in memory 136 and<br>
executed by processor 138 of telephone 130.<br>
A telephone interface layout is initiafly acquired at step 510. The<br>
acquired layout-is formatted according to a markup language and associates<br>
one or more telephone interface controls with a respective touch location and<br>
a respective action. The layout may comprise an XML-formatted file such as<br>
those described above, and may be acquired via any suitable transmission<br>
means including but not limited to a wireless link, a wired link (e.g. a USB<br>
cable), and a readable medium storing the file.<br>
According to some embodiments, a process is executed upon startup<br>
to load the acquired telephone interface layout. A user may be asked to<br>
select from two or more telephone interface layouts to load. In some<br>
embodiments, the startup process also displays an image depicting a plurality<br>
of telephone interface controls based on the loaded telephone interface<br>
layout. Other embodiments which utilize a non-imaging touch-sensitive<br>
device may comprise securing a printed medium depicting such an image to<br>
the non-imaging touch-sensitive device.<br>
FIG. 6 illustrates four outward views of a telephone after performing<br>
step 510 according to some embodiments. Images 610 through 640 each<br>
display a plurality of telephone interface controls associated with at least a<br>
location within a markup language-formatted file. In some embodiments,<br>
images 610 through 640 are printed on a medium that is secured to a touch-<br>
sensitive device (not shown). In other embodiments, images 610 through 640<br><br><br>
are displayed by a touch-sensitive screen such as a touch-sensitive liquid<br>
crystal display. The former embodiments may provide an inexpensive<br>
customizable telephone. Such a telephone may be produced by replacing its<br>
conventional numeric keypad with a touch-sensitive device.<br>
FIG. 7 illustrates system 700 to execute process 500 according to<br>
some embodiments. Touch-sensitive device 710 of system 700 may<br>
comprise an imaging or a non-imaging touchscreen. Prior to step 520,<br>
system 700 may initialize, configure and/or calibrate its hardware. Moreover,<br>
the acquired telephone interface layout that is stored among XML data 770<br>
may be parsed to create a list of each telephone interface control (i.e. widget)<br>
and their associated locations, actions, and/or touch feedback parameters.<br>
Next, processor 750 polls driver 760 of screen 710 at periodic intervals (e.g.,<br>
10ms) to determine if a bias has been exerted thereon.<br>
If so, touch location information is received at step 520. According to<br>
some embodiments, converter 740 may receive an analog signal from each of<br>
force sensors 722, 724, 726 and 728, and may transmit a digital signal based<br>
on the four signals over an SPI bus to driver 760. Processor 750 may then<br>
receive a corresponding coordinate pair upon polling driver 760.<br>
A telephone interface control is determined at step 530 based on the<br>
touch location information and the loaded telephone interface layout. In some<br>
embodiments, step 530 simply comprises identifying a telephone interface<br>
control that is associated with the location at which screen 710 was touched.<br>
An action associated with the determined interface control is similarly<br>
determined from the telephone interface layout at 540.<br>
The determined action is performed at step 550. An action may<br>
include, but is not limited to, dialing individual digits, dialing preset telephone<br>
numbers (i.e., speed dialing), and performing handwriting recognition. The<br>
action may be performed by using an application programming interface<br>
provided by system 700 or by otherwise controlling elements of system 700 to<br>
perform the determined action.<br>
FIG. 7 also illustrates server 780, which may be remotely located and<br>
used to perform any required handwriting recognition processing. In some<br><br><br>
embodiments of process 500, processor 750 determines that received touch<br>
location information corresponds to a handwriting recognition interface<br>
control, and then captures a stream of coordinate pairs until either a pen-up<br>
condition occurs or a fixed-length array is completely filled.<br>
A TCP socket is then opened to handwriting recognition server 780<br>
based on information (e.g. IP address, port number) specified by the<br>
telephone interface layout. The stream of coordinate pairs is transmitted to<br>
server 780 via the socket. Handwriting recognition server 780 processes the<br>
received data, responds with a recognized character, and closes the socket.<br>
The recognized character may be displayed on an available simple text<br>
display of the phone, if available.<br>
Handwriting recognition server 780 may be multi-threaded and may<br>
therefore serve multiple individual telephones concurrently. Handwriting<br>
recognition server 780 may alternatively be implemented on PCB 790.<br>
Handwriting received via a handwriting recognition interface control may also<br>
or alternatively be transmitted directly to a called party without recognition<br>
processing. Such an embodiment may be used to forward an authorizing<br>
signature to the called party.<br>
According to some embodiments such as that illustrated in FIG. 7,<br>
process 500 also includes providing touch feedback to a user based on touch<br>
feedback information of the telephone interface layout. In particular,<br>
processor 750 may determine such feedback based on the layout and on a<br>
telephone interface control determined at 530. The feedback may be<br>
represented by parameters such as cycle time, delay, cycle count, and<br>
damping, and may be implemented by driving coil 730 to generate a haptic<br>
vibration pattern. Coil 730 is representative of any number of coils that may<br>
be used to generate haptic feedback through screen 710. The circuitry of<br>
touchscreen 710 used to drive coil 730 may be connected to GPIO pins of<br>
PCB 790.<br>
FIG. 8 illustrates an alternative embodiment in which telephone 810<br>
does not include a processor capable of executing process 500. Accordingly,<br>
elements of process 500 may be distributed among touchscreen processor<br><br><br>
820 and telephony switch 830.<br>
In some embodiments, processor 820 comprises a low-cost processor,<br>
such as the Tl® MSP 430, bundled into a single assembly with touchscreen<br>
840. Processor 820 may execute any suitable operating system (e.g., the<br>
free operating system Tiny OS) and compiler. According to some<br>
embodiments, processor 820 executes code to poll A/D converter 850 and<br>
process data received therefrom as described above. Signaling circuitry of<br>
telephone 810 may be leveraged to transmit the processed data (e.g., touch<br>
location information) to telephony switch 830.<br>
Processor 860 of telephony switch 830 may perform steps 530 through<br>
550 based on the received data and on a telephone interface layout<br>
associated with telephone 810 and stored among XML data 860. If the<br>
received data is associated with touch feedback information, processor 860<br>
may transmit commands to generate touch feedback to telephone 810. As<br>
illustrated, these commands may be passed on to processor 820, which<br>
drives the touchscreen circuitry and coil 880 based thereon. Handwriting<br>
recognition may be provided by system 800 as described with respect to<br>
system 700.<br>
System 900 of FIG. 9 illustrates operation according to further<br>
embodiments. Telephone 910 includes elements (e.g., a processor) for<br>
driving the circuitry and coil 920 of touchscreen 930 to provide touch<br>
feedback. However, telephone 910 may pass touch location information to<br>
switch 940 and switch 940 may operate as described above with respect to<br>
switch 830.<br>
According to some embodiments, one or more telephone interface<br>
controls of a telephone interface layout may provide input to more than one<br>
service. Such a scenario may be particularly beneficial in an embedded<br>
environment (e.g., a conventional desktop telephone) where resources are<br>
limited, and where it may therefore be necessary for services (directory,<br>
email, etc.) to be deployed in a distributed manner.<br>
By way of example, FIG. 10 is a conceptual block diagram showing the<br>
currently-active directory service 1010 providing service to interface controls<br><br><br>
of telephone 1020. Accordingly, user input received by any of virtual wheel<br>
1030, 4-way navigation button 1040, and handwriting input box 1050 is<br>
directed to directory process 1010. Module 1060 receives the input, performs<br>
a directory search by querying directory database 1070, and formats and<br>
outputs the results to display manager 1080 via module 1090.<br>
According to some embodiments, the FIG. 10 framework may allow a<br>
user to enter a surname via handwriting input box 1050, and to use either<br>
virtual wheel 1030 or navigation button 1040 to scroll through the results. To<br>
support the framework, telephone 1020 may to maintain the notion of an<br>
active service to facilitate the transmission of all user inputs to an appropriate<br>
remote process corresponding to the active service. Such a notion may be<br>
maintained by enumerating services in the markup language-formatted<br>
telephone interface layout as shown below.<br><br><br>
  V-<br>
As shown, the enumerated services include the IP address and port<br>
number for a corresponding remote process. The specification of the<br>
telephone interface controls may remain unaffected and behave in the same<br>
way as described above.<br>
According to some embodiments using a touchscreen having display<br>
capability, a user operates a telephone to place a call to a hotel. A hotel<br>
phone device transmits a telephone interface layout as described above to the<br>
user's telephone. The layout is read by the user's telephone to display a<br>
plurality of telephone interface controls and to provide operation based<br>
thereon as described above. For example, the layout may include controls<br>
labeled "reception", "reservations", and "restaurant", each of which may be<br>
selected (i.e., "pressed) by the user to place a call to an associated number.<br>
According to some embodiments, the hotel phone device may transmit<br>
an imagemap which can be displayed by a mobile telephone browser.<br><br><br>
Selection of one of the displayed telephone interface controls may cause the<br>
telephone to invoke a corresponding URL, which may consist of a SIP event<br>
that generates a digit press.<br>
According to some embodiments, 4-way navigation button 1040 may<br>
operate to detect the force applied thereto by a user. An increase in the force<br>
may cause acceleration of a corresponding activity (e.g., text scrolling on the<br>
screen). The increased force may also be confirmed to the user via increased<br>
touch feedback.<br>
Some embodiments may provide layout modification on a telephone.<br>
Such embodiments would allow an end-user to design and/or modify a<br>
telephone interface layout using a telephone on which the layout is to be<br>
used. For example, the user may modify the shape, size, cofor and/or action<br>
associated with a telephone interface control.<br>
According to some embodiments of the foregoing, a user may input a<br>
name and telephone number of a business acquaintance in order to create a<br>
new "speed dial" button corresponding to the acquaintance. Still other<br>
embodiments of the foregoing may allow a desktop telephone to receive an<br>
image captured by a camera phone and to integrate the image into a<br>
telephone interface layout to be used by the desktop telephone.<br>
Any architecture and/or system described herein may include any<br>
number of devices and systems for transferring data, including but not limited<br>
to local area networks, wide area networks, telephone networks, cellular<br>
networks, fiber-optic networks, satellite networks, infra-red networks, radio<br>
frequency networks, and any other type of networks which may be used to<br>
transmit information between devices. Additionally, data may be transmitted<br>
using one or more currently- or hereafter-known network protocols, including<br>
but not limited to Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), Internet Protocol (IP),<br>
Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and Wireless Application Protocol (WAP).<br>
Embodiments described above are not intended to be limited to the<br>
specific form set forth herein, but are intended to cover such alternatives,<br>
