DESCRIPTION<br>
METHOD FOR PRODUCING SPHERICAL BASE GRANULES COMPRISING<br>
HARDLY WATER-SOLUBLE DRUG<br>
Technical Field<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a production method of spherical<br>
base granules comprising a hardly water-soluble drug.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0002]<br>
Pharmaceutical solid preparations sometimes have sustained release,<br>
enteric, or bitterness-masking film coating with a view to reducing side effects<br>
of a drug comprising in them, reducing the administration frequency, improving<br>
the effect of the drug, suppressing a bitter taste, stabilizing the drug, or the like.<br>
Drug-containing spherical granules having a dosage form suited for film<br>
coating thereon are called spherical base granules.<br>
[0003]<br>
As a production method of spherical base granules, a method of<br>
carrying out extrusion granulation using a drug and an excipient as raw<br>
materials and then spheronizing the resulting granule product (extrusion-<br>
spheronization method), a method of coating the surface of spherical core<br>
particles with a drug (layering method) (refer to, for example, Patent Document<br>
1), and the like are known.<br>
[0004]<br>
In the layering method, granules are produced by spraying a layering<br>
liquid comprising a drug, a binder, and the like to spherical core particles to<br><br>
coat them with a coating layer. Specific examples of it include a method of<br>
simultaneously supplying drug powders and an aqueous solution of a binder<br>
and coating spherical core particles with them; a method of supplying a<br>
suspension of drug particles and coating the spherical core particles therewith;<br>
and a method of supplying an aqueous solution of a drug and coating the<br>
spherical core particles therewith.<br>
[0005]<br>
The layering method is suited as a method for producing spherical<br>
base granules to be film-coated, because spherical base granules having a<br>
high sphericity and a narrow particle size distribution can be obtained using<br>
spherical core particles having a high sphericity and a narrow particle size<br>
distribution.<br>
[0006]<br>
However, when a drug that is contained in the layering liquid has low<br>
water solubility (hardly water-soluble drug), dispersion in an apparatus having<br>
a high shear force is necessary to obtain a uniform suspension. Therefore,<br>
when such a layering liquid is prepared, vigorous foaming occurs, and foam<br>
breaking is sometimes necessary. In addition, in a layering liquid having a<br>
practical drug concentration, the drug particles precipitate with the passage of<br>
time. The layering liquid therefore must be stirred/mixed constantly to keep<br>
the suspension uniform. Even if the layering liquid is stirred/mixed constantly,<br>
there is a risk of a tube or spray nozzle being clogged with<br>
precipitated/agglomerated particles during a transfer of the layering liquid from<br>
a tank to the spray nozzle. When the drug has a large particle size, the above<br>
risk increases further, which leads to deterioration in adhesion to spherical<br>
core particles, a reduction in a recovery ratio, and an increase in<br>
agglomeration ratio due to inhibition of smooth tumbling. A reduction in the<br><br>
size of the drug particles improves suspension stability of the layering liquid<br>
and a recovery ratio, but it need's an extra pulverization (or grinding) treatment<br>
step of the drug particles.<br>
[0007]<br>
It is known to add various additives to the layering liquid for the<br>
purpose of preventing detachment of the coated drug, controlling a dissolution<br>
rate of the drug, or stabilizing the layering liquid (refer to, for example, Patent<br>
Documents 2, 3, and 4). These prior arts however fail to improve the<br>
suspensibility of a hardly water-soluble drug. Patent Documents 2 to 4<br>
include no description on the use of both micronized microcrystalline cellulose<br>
and an emulsifier in combination<br>
Patent Document 5 discloses a technology of coating spherical core<br>
particles with a hardly water-soluble drug, an emulsifier, and the like in<br>
accordance with the layering method, but the technology specifically disclosed<br>
herein is a layering method in which drug powders and an aqueous solution of<br>
a binder are supplied simultaneously to coat therewith the particles. Patent<br>
Document 5 includes no description on the improvement of suspensibility<br>
during addition of a hardly water-soluble drug to a layering liquid.<br>

Disclosure of the Invention<br><br>
Problems to be solved by the Invention<br>
[0009]<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a method of producing,<br>
with an improved production efficiency, spherical base granules comprising a<br>
hardly water-soluble drug by using a layering liquid comprising the hardly<br>
water-soluble drug, having good suspension stability, and controlled to<br>
minimize foaming.<br>
Means for Solving the Problem<br>
[0010]<br>
The present inventors have carried out an extensive investigation with<br>
a view to overcoming the above-described problem. As a result, it has been<br>
found that by adding micronized microcrystalline cellulose and an emulsifier in<br>
a layering liquid, suspension stability of the layering liquid is improved and<br>
foaming is suppressed without extra pulverization treatment of a drug, leading<br>
to the completion of the present invention. The following is the details of the<br>
present invention.<br>
A production method of spherical base granules comprising a hardly<br>
water-soluble drug, which comprises spraying a layering liquid to<br>
pharmaceutically inert spherical core particles and coating the particles with a<br>
drug-containing layer, wherein the layering liquid comprises:<br>
(1)	from 0.01 to 50 % by mass of hardly water-soluble drug particles<br>
having a maximum long diameter and a maximum short diameter of not<br>
greater than 30% and not greater than 12% of an average short diameter of<br>
the spherical core particles, respectively;<br>
(2)	from 0.1 to 2 % by mass of micronized microcrystalline cellulose;<br>
and<br><br>
(3) from 0.01 to 1 % by mass of an emulsifier.<br>
Advantage of the Invention<br>
[0011]<br>
The method according to the present invention enables stable<br>
production of spherical base granules comprising a hardly water-soluble drug<br>
with high productivity.<br>
Best Mode for Carrying out the Invention<br>
[0012]<br>
The present invention will hereinafter be described specifically.<br>
The spherical core particles to be used in the present invention are<br>
pharmaceutically inert. This means that the core particles do not comprise a<br>
drug.<br>
The term "drug" as used herein means what is used for treatment,<br>
prevention, or diagnosis of human or animal diseases but what is not an<br>
instrument/machine.<br>
[0013]<br>
The spherical core particles may contain one or more pharmaceutical<br>
additive. Examples of such a pharmaceutical additive include excipients such<br>
as lactose, sucrose, D-mannitol, corn starch, powder cellulose, calcium<br>
hydrogen phosphate, and calcium carbonate; disintegrants such as low-<br>
substituted hydroxypropyl cellulose, carmellose calcium, pregelatinized starch ,<br>
croscarmellose sodium, crospovidone, and carboxymethyl starch; binders such<br>
as hydroxypropyl cellulose, povidone (polyvinylpyrrolidone), and xanthan gum;<br>
coating agents such as hypromelose (hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose),<br>
methacrylic acid copolymer LD, and ethylcellulose aqueous dispersion;<br><br>
emulsifiers such as sucrose fatty acid ester, glycerin fatty acid ester, sodium<br>
lauryl sulfate, and polysorbate 60; and other additives such as talc, magnesium<br>
stearate, magnesium aluminometasilicate, titanium oxide, light silicic anhydride,<br>
microcrystalline cellulose carmellose sodium.<br>
[0014]<br>
Preferred examples of a formulation include spherical core particles<br>
composed only of sucrose, those composed of 70 % by mass of sucrose and<br>
30 % by mass of corn starch, those composed of 30 % by mass or more of<br>
microcrystalline cellulose and another pharmaceutical additive, those<br>
composed only of microcrystalline cellulose, and those composed only of<br>
mannitol. Spherical core particles comprising 30 % by mass or more of<br>
microcrystalline cellulose are preferred because of having high strength and<br>
high water absorption capacity. Those comprising 70 % by mass or more of<br>
microcrystalline cellulose are more preferred, with spherical core particles<br>
composed only of crystalline cellulose being still more preferred. Spherical<br>
core particles composed only of microcrystalline cellulose are most preferred.<br>
[0015]<br>
The term "spherical" of spherical core particles means that the<br>
particles have a sphericity (= short diameter/long diameter) of 0.7 or greater.<br>
Particles which are not spherical are not preferred because they deteriorate<br>
uniformity of film coating. The spherical core particles having a sphericity of<br>
0.9 or greater are preferred.<br>
As the spherical core particles, those having an average particle size<br>
of from about 50 to 1000 µm can be used. The particle size distribution is<br>
preferably sharp. The bulk density is preferably from about 0.5 to 2.0 g/cm3.<br>
The spherical core particles composed only of microcrystalline cellulose have<br>
generally a bulk density of from about 0.5 to 1.0 g/cm3. The mechanical<br><br>
strength is preferably higher.<br>
[0016]<br>
The layering liquid to be used in the present invention will next be<br>
described.<br>
First, hardly water-soluble drug particles to be incorporated in the<br>
layering liquid of the present invention will be described.<br>
The term "hardly water-soluble" as used herein means that the<br>
particles do not dissolve in water readily and they have solubility, in 1 cm3 of<br>
water at 20°C, of 0.001 g or less.<br>
Examples of the hardly water-soluble drug include amcinonide,<br>
ibuprofen, indomethacin, ethenzamide, erythromycin, cefotiam hexetil<br>
hydrochloride, nicardipine hydrochloride, omeprazole, prednisolone valerate<br>
acetate, diflucortolone valerate, dexamethasone valerate, betamethasone<br>
valerate, clarithromycin, griseofulvin, clonazepam, chloramphenicol, synthetic<br>
peptide compounds, cortisone acetate, diflorasone diacetate, dexamethasone<br>
acetate, triamcinolone acetate, paramethasone acetate, hydrocortisone<br>
acetate, fludrocortisone acetate, methylprednisolone acetate, diazepam,<br>
digitoxin, digoxin, difluprednate, beclometasone dipropionate, betamethasone<br>
dipropionate, sulpiride, sulfathiazole, cefuroxime axetil, dexamethasone,<br>
triamcinolone, triamcinolone acetonide, nicardipine, nifedipine, nilvadipine,<br>
noscapine, halcinonide, hydrocortisone, flumetasone pivalate, phenacetin,<br>
phenitoin, budesonide, prazepam, fluocinonide, fluocinolone acetonide,<br>
fluorometholone, fludroxycortide, prednisolone, alclometasone dipropionate,<br>
clobetasol propionate, dexamethasone propionate, deprodone propionate,<br>
betamethasone, migrenin, methylprednisolone, ubidecarenone, clobetasone<br>
butyrate, hydrocortisone butyrate, hydrocortisone butyrate propionate,<br>
riboflavin butyrate, lansoprazole, and riboflavin.<br><br>
[0017]<br>
The hardly water-soluble drug particles are preferably smaller. The<br>
maximum long diameter of them is 30% or less of the average short diameter<br>
of the spherical core particles and the maximum short diameter is 12% or less<br>
of the average short diameter of the spherical core particles. When each of<br>
the diameters exceeds the specified values, respectively, the drug particles are<br>
likely to detach from the spherical base granules, and the recovery ratio of the<br>
spherical base granules will decrease. In addition, presence of the drug<br>
particles detached from the granules inhibits tumbling of the spherical core<br>
particles, resulting in an increase in agglomeration of the spherical base<br>
granules.<br>
The maximum long diameter of the drug particles is preferably not<br>
greater than 20% of the average short diameter of the spherical core particles<br>
and the minimum short diameter of the drug particles is preferably not greater<br>
than 10%.<br>
[0018]<br>
The hardly water-soluble particles are added to the layering liquid in<br>
an amount of from 0.01 to 50 % by mass. When the amount is less than<br>
0.01 % by mass, layering need to be performed for long hours to coat the<br>
spherical core particles with a necessary amount of the drug. When it<br>
exceeds 50 % by mass, on the other hand, the viscosity of the layering liquid<br>
becomes too high and prevents smooth spraying. It is preferably from 1 to<br>
30 % by mass, more preferably from 5 to 20 % by mass.<br>
[0019]<br>
The micronized microcrystalline cellulose to be incorporated in the<br>
layering liquid of the present invention will hereinafter be described.<br>
The term " micronized microcrystalline cellulose" to be incorporated in<br><br>
the layering liquid in the present invention means microcrystalfine cellulose<br>
having an average particle size of 12 µm or less as measured in water. It is<br>
more preferably 9 urn or less.<br>
The term "microcrystalline cellulose" as used herein means that<br>
conforms to any of the standards "Microcrystalline cellulose" specified in the<br>
Japanese Pharmacopoeia, Fifteenth Edition, "Microcrystalline cellulose"<br>
specified in Japanese Standards of Food Additives, Seventh Edition, and<br>
"Microcrystalline cellulose-carmellose sodium" specified in Japanese<br>
Pharmaceutical Excipients 2003.<br>
[0020]<br>
The micronized microcrystalline cellulose is, for example, that<br>
obtained by dry or wet grinding of typical microcrystalline cellulose or that<br>
obtained by dispersing microcrystalline cellulose-carmellose sodium in water.<br>
Microcrystalline cellulose-carmellose sodium is preferred because a layering<br>
liquid comprising it can be prepared easily and at the same time, has high<br>
suspension stability, and spherical base granules available using it have high<br>
strength.<br>
[0021]<br>
The micronized microcrystalline cellulose is added to the layering<br>
liquid in an amount of from 0.1 to 2 % by mass. When the amount is less<br>
than 0.1 % by mass, a sufficient suspension stabilizing effect is not obtained.<br>
When it exceeds 2 % by mass, on the other hand, the layering liquid has a too<br>
high viscosity and cannot be sprayed smoothly. It is preferably from 0.2 to<br>
1 % by mass, more preferably from 0.3 to 0.8 % by mass.<br>
[0022]<br>
Addition of the micronized microcrystalline cellulose to the layering<br>
liquid improves suspension stability of the hardly water-soluble drug particles in<br><br>
the layering liquid and solves the problem of clogging a tube and also a spray<br>
nozzle therewith. Moreover, it improves the adhesion of the hardly water-<br>
soluble drug particles to the spherical core particles so that it is also effective<br>
for raising a recovery ratio and reducing an agglomeration ratio.<br>
[0023]<br>
An emulsifier that can be comprised in the layering liquid of the<br>
present invention will next be described.<br>
in the present invention, the term "emulsifier" that may be comprised<br>
in the layering liquid means a substance having an emulsifying function to be<br>
used for the preparation of pharmaceutical formulations.<br>
Examples of the emulsifier include sucrose fatty acid esters, glycerin<br>
fatty acid esters, sodium lauryl sulfate, polysorbates, polyoxyethylene<br>
hydrogenated castor oils, carmellose sodium, and xanthan gum. The<br>
emulsifier is adequately selected, depending on the physical properties of the<br>
drug particles. Of these, polyoxyethylene hydrogenated castor oils are<br>
preferred from the viewpoint of their high foaming suppressing effect, with<br>
polyoxyethylene hydrogenated castor oil 60 being more preferred. The<br>
polyoxyethylene hydrogenated castor oil 60 is a nonionic surfactant obtained<br>
by addition polymerization of a hydrogenated castor oil with ethylene oxides<br>
and having an average molar number of added ethylene oxide of about 60. It<br>
has a CAS No. of 61788-85-0. The average molar number of ethylene oxide<br>
added to polyoxyethylene hydrogenated castor oil 60 is preferably from 52 to<br>
68, more preferably from 55 to 65.<br>
[0024]<br>
The emulsifier is added to the layering liquid in an amount of from<br>
0.01 to 1 % by mass. Amounts less than 0.01 % by mass do not sufficiently<br>
improve the affinity of the drug particles with water. Although there is no<br><br>
upper limit for the additive amount of emulsifier, the effect is not enhanced as<br>
much as expected when the additive amount exceeds 1 % by mass or greater.<br>
The amount is more preferably from 0.05 to 0.8 % by mass.<br>
[0025]<br>
Addition of the emulsifier to the layering liquid raises affinity of the<br>
drug particles with water, thereby suppressing foaming. Due to a synergetic<br>
effect of the emulsifier and micronized microcrystalline cellulose, the layering<br>
liquid becomes a stable suspension. Only slight stirring or, in some cases, no<br>
stirring is therefore necessary for maintaining the suspension state of the<br>
layering liquid.<br>
To a suspension such as a suspension syrup or dry syrup comprising<br>
sucrose at a concentration of 20 % by mass or a concentration as high as<br>
about 5 % by mass or greater, microcrystalline cellulose carmellose sodium<br>
and an emulsifier such as polysorbate have been sometimes added in<br>
combination in order to improve suspension stability. However, a problem of<br>
foaming does not originally happen in such a suspension, as it contains<br>
sucrose at a high concentration. Therefore, for those skilled in the art, it is<br>
unexpected that combination use of an emulsifier and micronized<br>
microcrystalline cellulose in the layering liquid that dose not comprise sucrose<br>
at high concentration produces not only a suspension stabilization effect but<br>
also an excellent foaming suppressing effect.<br>
[0026]<br>
Another pharmaceutical additive may be added to the layering liquid<br>
as needed, in particular, addition of a binder is especially preferred because<br>
it improves the strength of the drug-containing layer. Examples of the binder<br>
include hydroxypropyl cellulose, povidone, and hypromelose<br>
(hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose).<br><br>
[0027]<br>
A process of coating the spherical core particles with a layer<br>
comprising the hardly water-soluble drug by layering will next be described.<br>
Fluidized-bed coating apparatuses can be used for coating the<br>
spherical core particles with the layer comprising a hardly water-soluble drug.<br>
Examples of the fluidized-bed coating apparatus include, in addition to an<br>
ordinary fluidized bed type, a spouted fluidized-bed type having, inside thereof,<br>
a guide tube (Wurster column) and a tumbling fluidized-bed type equipped, on<br>
the bottom thereof, a rotation mechanism.<br>
Specific examples of such apparatuses include "Flow Coater" and<br>
"Spiral Flow", products of Freund Corporation, "WST/WSG Series" and "GPCG<br>
Series", products of Glatt GmbH, "New Marumerizer", product of Fuji Paudal<br>
Co., Ltd., and "Multiplex", product of Powrex Corporation.<br>
[0028]<br>
The layering liquid can be supplied by a method suited for each of<br>
apparatuses such as top spray, bottom spray, side spray, and tangential spray.<br>
It may be sprayed to the spherical core particles continuously or intermittently.<br>
After completion of spraying, the spherical base granules are dried. Drying of<br>
the spherical base granules may be performed as are or after controlling an air<br>
flow rate or temperature as needed, while not taking out the granules from the<br>
apparatus.<br>
[0029]<br>
The coating amount of the drug-containing layer can be determined<br>
based on the formulation design such as single dosage or size of the<br>
preparation. For example, it is generally from about 0.5 to 200 % by mass<br>
relative to the spherical core particles.<br>
[0030]<br><br>
Next, one example of a production method of the spherical base<br>
granules will be described.<br>
(a)	Preparation of micronized microcrystalline cellulose: First,<br>
microcrystalline cellulose is dispersed in water and the resulting aqueous<br>
dispersion is micronized in a Manton-Gaulin Homogenizer. Micronization=<br>
treatment is performed for necessary times at high pressure, for example, at<br>
50 MPa and five passes. When micronized microcrystalline cellulose (for<br>
example, "CEOLUS Cream" FP-03, product of Asahi Kasei Chemicals<br>
Corporation, solid content: 10 % by mass, average particle size: about 4 µm)<br>
or microcrystalline cellulose.carmellose sodium (for example, "CEOLUS" RC-<br>
A591NF, product of Asahi Kasei Chemicals Corporation) is used, the<br>
micronization step is not necessary.<br>
(b)	Preparation of layering liquid: A layering liquid is prepared by<br>
adding a hardly water-soluble drug, the micronized microcrystalline cellulose,<br>
an emulsifier, and necessary pharmaceutical additives to water and stirring the<br>
mixture sufficiently until dissolved or suspended. During stirring, a rotary<br>
disperser is preferably used to fully minimize the micronized microcrystalline<br>
cellulose and mix it with the other components. Examples of the disperser<br>
include "T.K. Homomixer", product of Tokushu Kika Kogyo Co., Ltd. and<br>
"ULTRA TURRAX", product of IKA Company. A stirrer having a weak stirring<br>
power such as propeller stirrer is not so preferred. In order to confirm<br>
dissolution or dispersion, components may be dispersed sequentially.<br>
(c)	Heating of spherical core particles and fluidized-bed coating<br>
apparatus: After spherical core particles are charged in a fluidized-bed coating<br>
apparatus, the core particles are fluidized (when the fluidized-bed coating<br>
apparatus is a tumbling fluidized-bed type is employed, the rotation portion of it<br>
is turned simultaneously) by supplying hot air from the bottom portion of the<br><br>
apparatus until an outlet-air temperature reaches a predetermined temperature.<br>
(d)	Coating with drug layer: The layering liquid is sprayed at a<br>
predetermined spray rate continuously or intermittently or at a rate raised in a<br>
stepwise fashion. The supply of the layering liquid is terminated when the<br>
coating amount reaches a predetermined amount.<br>
(e)	Drying of spherical base granules: The spherical base granules<br>
are dried while adjusting the amount of hot air and temperature (rotation speed<br>
of the rotating portion when a tumbling fluidized-bed type is employed) if<br>
necessary.<br>
(f)	Taking-out of spherical base granules: In the end, the resulting<br>
spherical base granules are taken out from the apparatus.<br>
[0031]<br>
The spherical base granules obtained by the present invention can be<br>
used as granules, capsules, tablets or the like after subjected to particle size<br>
regulation and sustained release film coating, enteric film coating, or bitter-<br>
taste masking film coating if necessary.<br>
Example 1<br>
[0032]<br>
The present invention will next be described based on some<br>
examples. First, measuring methods of physical properties are described<br>
collectively.<br><sphericity of spherical core particles><br>
The shape of a sample is photographed using a digital microscope<br>
("VH-7000", product of KEYENCE CORPORATION) (with a 50x or 100x lens)<br>
and a short diameter (D) and a long diameter (L) of 50 particles are measured<br>
 using an image analyzer ("Image Hyper", product of Inter Quest). The terms<br><br>
"short diameter" and "long diameter" as used herein mean the length of a short<br>
side and the length of a long side of the smallest (in area) rectangle that<br>
circumscribes a boundary pixels of a particle, respectively. The sphericity is<br>
an average of a short diameter/long diameter (D/L) ratio<br><average short diameter of spherical core particles><br>
The average short diameter is a value at which the cumulative<br>
distribution of short diameter (D), which is determined in the same manner as<br>
the measuring method of sphericity, reaches 50%.<br><tapped bulk density of spherical core particles><br>
A 100-cm3 graduated cylinder is filled with 30 g of a sample and a<br>
tapped volume [cm3] after tapping about 30 times is measured. The bulk<br>
density is calculated in accordance with the following equation. This<br>
operation is performed three times and an average is adopted as a tapped bulk<br>
density.<br>
Apparent tapped density [g/cm3] = 30 [g]/tapped volume [cm3].<br><separation condition of layering liquid><br>
The layering liquid (30 cm3) is charged in a sample bottle having a<br>
diameter of 40 mm and a height of 50 mm and the state after five minutes is<br>
observed.<br><maximum long diameter and short of drug particles><br>
A sample is prepared by dropping the layering liquid onto a slide<br>
glass and then, placing a cover glass thereon. The sample is photographed<br>
using an optical microscope (use of a 40 × lens). Long diameter and short<br>
diameter of each of 50 drug particles on the photograph are measured and the<br>
maximum long diameter [µm] and maximum short diameter [urn] are<br>
determined.<br><particle size of micronized microcrystalline cellulose><br><br>
In the same manner as that employed for the preparation of the<br>
layering liquid, micronized microcrystalline cellulose is dispersed in purified<br>
water and a median diameter [urn] of the resulting dispersion is determined<br>
using a laser diffraction/scattering particle-size distribution analyzer ("LA-910",<br>
product of Horiba, Ltd.) while setting a specific refractive index at 1.20. The<br>
above operation is performed twice and an average is used.<br><recovery ratio by mass of spherical base granules><br>
The recovery ratio is determined in accordance with the following<br>
equation based on the recovery amount [g] of spherical base granules after<br>
layering and the total amount [g] of raw materials employed.<br>
Recovery ratio [% by mass] = {recovery amount [g]/total amount [g] of raw<br>
materials} x 100<br><agglomeration ratio of spherical base granules><br>
After dispersion of spherical base granules on paper, the number [a]<br>
of particles constituting agglomerated granules and the number [b] of single<br>
isolated particles are counted visually. The agglomeration ratio is calculated<br>
in accordance with the following equation. The number of particles observed<br>
is 1000 (=a+b).<br>
Agglomeration ratio [%] = {a/(a+b)}x100<br>
[0033] [Example 1]<br>
(Preparation of layering liquid)<br>
While stirring 74.4 g of water in a rotary disperser ("T. K. Homomixer<br>
Mark II f model", product of Tokushu Kika Kogyo Co., Ltd.) at 5000 rpm, 15 g<br>
of povidone ("K-30", product of ISP Tec. Inc.) was added. The resulting<br>
mixture was stirred further until completely dissolved. Then, 0.1 g of a<br>
polyoxyethylene hydrogenated castor oil ("HCO-60", product of Nikko<br>
Chemicals Co., Ltd.) as an emulsifier was dispersed in the resulting solution<br><br>
until dissolved. 10 g of Ethenzamide ("Type A", product of API Corporation)<br>
was added in the resulting solution as a hardly water-soluble drug and then,<br>
0.5 g of microcrystalline cellulose-carmellose sodium ("CEOLUS" RC-A591NF,<br>
product of Asahi Kasei Chemicals Corporation) was added as a micronized<br>
microcrystalline cellulose, followed by dispersion for 30 minutes to prepare a<br>
layering liquid.<br>
The resulting layering liquid was free from separation of the drug and<br>
foaming after completion of the dispersion and had considerably high<br>
suspension stability compared with that obtained in Comparative Example 1,<br>
which will be described later.<br>
(Layering)<br>
In a Wurster coating apparatus ("Multiplex" MP-01, equipped with a<br>
Wurster column, product of Powrex Corporation) was charged 0.3 kg of<br>
spherical core particles composed of 100% of microcrystalline cellulose<br>
("Celphere" CP-203, product of Asahi Kasei Chemicals Corporation, sphericity:<br>
0.9, tapped bulk density: 0.98 g/cm3, average short diameter: 165 µm) and the<br>
spherical core particles were layered until the layering amount reached 12.8 %<br>
by mass (5.0 % by mass in terms of the drug) under the conditions of a spray<br>
air pressure of 0.16 MPa, a spray air flow rate of 40 L/min, an inlet-air<br>
temperature of from 65 to 70°C, an outlet-air temperature of 40°C, an air flow<br>
rate of 40 m3/h, and a layering liquid spray rate of 3 g/min. The layering liquid<br>
was stirred with propeller constantly at 150 rpm. After the spraying of the<br>
layering liquid was terminated, drying was performed without changing the<br>
conditions until the outlet-air temperature increased to 42°C. A heater for<br>
inlet-air was then turned off and cooling was performed until the inlet-air<br>
temperature became 40°C.<br>
Few powdered drug that did not attach to the spherical core particles<br><br>
were observed and almost all the amount of the granules was recovered . In<br>
addition, the granules thus obtained were almost free from agglomeration.<br>
The results are shown in Table 1.<br>
[0034] [Example 2]<br>
(Layering)<br>
In a tumbling fluidized-bed coating apparatus ("Multiplex MP-01",<br>
product of Powrex Corporation) was charged 0.6 kg of spherical core particles<br>
which was the same as that used in Example 1 and they were layered with the<br>
layering liquid prepared in Example 1 until the layering amount became 12.8 %<br>
by mass (5.0 % by mass in terms of the drug) of the spherical core particles by<br>
using a tangential bottom spray under the conditions of a spray air pressure of<br>
0.16 MPa, a spray air flow rate of 40 L/min, an inlet-air temperature of from<br>
75°C, an outlet-air temperature of 41 °C, an air flow rate of 35 m3/h, a rotation<br>
speed of a rotor of 400 rpm, and a layering liquid spray rate of 5.0 g/min. The<br>
iayering liquid was stirred with propeller constantly at 150 rpm. After spraying<br>
of the layering liquid was terminated, the rotation speed of a rotor was<br>
decreased to 200 rpm and drying was performed until the outlet-air<br>
temperature reached 42°C. A heater for inlet-air was then turned off and<br>
cooling was performed until the inlet-air temperature became 40°C.<br>
Few powdered drug that did not attached to the spherical core<br>
particles were observed. The resulting spherical base granules showed good<br>
results with a recovery ratio of 94.6% and an agglomeration ratio of 1.2%.<br>
The results are shown in Table 1.<br>
[0035] [Comparative Example 1]<br>
(Preparation of layering liquid)<br>
While stirring 75.0 g of water in a rotary disperser ("T. K. Homomixer<br>
Mark II f model", product of Tokushu Kika Kogyo Co., Ltd.) at 5000 rpm, 15 g<br><br>
of povidone was added. The resulting mixture was stirred further until<br>
completely dissolved. Then, 10 g of ethenzamide was added and the<br>
resulting mixture was dispersed for 30 minutes to prepare a layering liquid.<br>
The resulting layering liquid foamed severely and foams did not<br>
disappear even after the passage of time. Five minutes after completion of<br>
the preparation, precipitation of the drug occurred and the layering liquid had<br>
only poor suspension stability.<br>
(Layering)<br>
In the same manner as Example 1 except that the inlet-air<br>
temperature was raised to from 70 to 78°C and layering liquid was stirred with<br>
propeller at 300 rpm, layering was performed.<br>
A recovery ratio of the spherical base granules decreased because<br>
the drug did not attach to the spherical core particles and the powdered drug<br>
attached to a bug filter at the upper portion of the apparatus. Moreover, the<br>
spherical base granules thus obtained contained many agglomerated particles.<br>
The results are shown in Table 1.<br><br><br><br>
[0037]<br>
The spherical base granules obtained in Examples 1 and 2 by using<br>
the layering liquid comprising both a micronized microcrystalline cellulose and<br>
an emulsifier did not contain many agglomerated granules and showed a high<br>
recovery ratio.<br>
In contrast, the spherical base granules obtained in Comparative<br>
Example 1 by using the layering liquid comprising neither a micronized<br>
microcrystalline cellulose nor an emulsifier, agglomerated due to foaming of<br>
the layering liquid and showed a low recovery ratio.<br>
[0038] [Referential Example]<br>
While stirring 89.4 g of water in a rotary disperser at 5000 rpm, 0.1 g<br>
of polyoxyethylene hydrogenated castor oil was added. The resulting mixture<br>
was stirred until completely dissolved. To the resulting solution were added<br>
successively 10 g of ethenzamide and 0.5 g of microcrystalline cellulose-<br>
carmellose sodium which is the same as that employed in Example 1. The<br>
resulting mixture was dispersed for 30 minutes to prepare a layering liquid.<br>
The layering liquid thus obtained was a uniform and highly clouded<br>
suspension free from foaming and precipitation of drug particles. The<br>
appearance of it is shown in-JFIG. 1. The observation results of the<br>
appearance are shown in Table 2.<br>
[0039] [Referential Comparative Example 1]<br>
While stirring 88.0 g of water in a rotary disperser at 5000 rpm, 2 g of<br>
povidone was added. The resulting mixture was stirred further until<br>
completely dissolved. In the resulting solution was added 10 g of<br>
ethenzamide, followed by dispersing for 30 minutes to prepare a layering liquid.<br>
The resulting layering liquid showed an uneven state with a foamy drug<br>
separated in the upper 53% portion of the liquid.<br><br>
The appearance of the layering liquid is shown in FIG. 2. The<br>
observation results of the appearance are shown in Table 2.<br>
[0040] [Referential Comparative Example 2]<br>
In the same manner as Referential Comparative Example 1 except<br>
that the amount of povidone was 15 g, a layering liquid was prepared. The<br>
separation state of the liquid was observed. Although the drug amount<br>
present in the lower layer increased compared with that in Referential<br>
Comparative Example 1, the foamy drug layer in the upper portion was still<br>
present without decreasing.<br>
The appearance of the layering liquid is shown in FIG. 3. The<br>
observation results of the appearance are shown in Table 2.<br>
[0041] [Referential Comparative Example 3]<br>
While stirring 89.5 g of water in a rotary disperser at 5000 rpm, 0.1 g<br>
of polyoxyethylene hydrogenated castor oil was added. The resulting mixture<br>
was stirred further until completely dissolved. In the resulting solution was<br>
added 10 g of ethenzamide, followed by dispersion for 30 minutes to obtain a<br>
layering liquid.<br>
The resulting layering liquid was separated into three layers. The<br>
upper 23% layer contained foams, while the lower 23% layer contained a drug<br>
precipitation layer. The appearance of the liquid is shown in FIG. 4. The<br>
observation results of the appearance are shown in Table 2.<br>
[0042] [Referential Comparative Example 4]<br>
In the same manner as Referential Comparative Example 3 except<br>
that 0.3 g of polyoxyethylene hydrogenated castor oil was added to 89.7 g of<br>
water, a layering liquid was prepared.<br>
The lower 11 % layer was a drug precipitation layer, showing a little<br>
improvement compared with Referential Comparative Example 3 but a<br><br>
problem of three-layer separation does not resolved. The observation results<br>
of the appearance are shown in Table 2.<br>
[0043] [Referential Comparative Example 5]<br>
While stirring 89.4 g of water in a rotary disperser at 5000 rpm, 0.5 g<br>
of microcrystalline cellulose-carmellose sodium was added. The resulting<br>
mixture was dispersed for 30 minutes. In the resulting dispersion was added<br>
10 g of ethenzamide, followed by dispersion for 30 minutes to prepare a<br>
layering liquid.<br>
The layering liquid thus obtained showed an uneven state with a<br>
foamy drug layer in the upper 52% portion of the liquid as in Referential<br>
Comparative Example 1. The observation results of the appearance are<br>
shown in Table 2.<br>
[0044] [Referential Comparative Example 6]<br>
In the same manner as Referential Comparative Example 5 except<br>
that 2.2 g of microcrystalline cellulose-carmellose sodium which is the same as<br>
that used in Example 1 was added to 87.8 g of water, a layering liquid was<br>
prepared.<br>
The layering liquid thus obtained showed a uniform state without<br>
separation, but it became a gel due to the addition of a large amount of<br>
microcrystalline cellulose-carmellose sodium. The resulting gel was so tacky<br>
and it was difficult to transfer the layering liquid via a tube pump. The<br>
appearance is shown in FIG. 5. The observation results of the appearance<br>
are shown in Table 2.<br><br><br><br>
[0046]<br>
The layering liquid obtained in Referential Example by using<br>
micronized microcrystalline cellulose and an emulsifier in combination was a<br>
uniform suspension.<br>
In contrast, the layering liquids comprising neither micronized<br>
microcrystalline cellulose nor emulsifier separated into two layers (Referential<br>
Comparative Examples 1 and 2). The layering liquids comprising the<br>
emulsifier but not comprising the micronized microcrystalline cellulose foamed<br>
severely and separated into three layers (Referential Comparative Examples 3<br>
and 4). The layering liquid comprising the micronized microcrystalline<br>
cellulose but not comprising the emulsifier did not foam and the layer<br>
separation was partially resolved (Referential Comparative Example 5). In<br>
order to completely resolve the problem of separation, however, it was<br>
necessary to increase the amount of micronized microcrystalline cellulose to<br>
the extent that it made the layering liquid into gel and thus made it<br>
unsatisfactory as a layering liquid (Referential Comparative Example 6).<br>
From the above results, it has been confirmed that the layering liquid<br>
comprising a hardly water-soluble drug has improved suspension stability<br>
when both micronized microcrystalline cellulose and an emulsifier are added in<br>
combination to the liquid.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>

the production of film-coated pharmaceutical granules.<br><br>
