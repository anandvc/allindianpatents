BRIEF DESCRIPTION<br>
The above objects and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent by describing in detail a preferred embodiment thereof with reference to the attached drawings in which:<br>
FIG 1 is a block diagram of a conventional wireless transmission system for video packet transmission;<br>
FIG. 2 is a block diagram of a wireless transmission system for video packet data according to the present invention;<br>
FIG. 3A is a block diagram of another embodiment of the wireless transmission system for the video packet data according to the present invention; and<br>
FIG. 3B shows a receiving system for receiving video packet data transmitted from the wireless transmission system shown in FIG. 3A and decoding the received video packets.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Hereinafter, embodiments of the present invention will be described in more<br>
detail will reference to tho attached drawings.   FIG. 2 is a block diagram of a<br>
wireless transmission system for transmitting video packet data according to the present invention. The wireless transmission system of FIG. 2 includes a video encoder 200, a degree of importance determiner 202, a degree of importance storage unit 204, a video data transmission determiner 206, a video data packetizing unit 208, and a wireless transmitter 210,<br>
The video encoder 200 encodes a moving picture to be transmitted. The encoding can be performed in units of a 16x16-p!xel macro block. The degree of importance determiner 202 determines the degree of importance of the encoded data. Parameters for determining the degree of importance are whether video data is intra encoded or inter encoded, the motion vector value of the encoded video data, or whether the encoded video data falls on edge values. The degree of importance determiner 202 can determine the degree of importance of the encoded data by putting weight values on the above-mentioned parameters. The degree of importance storage unit 204 stores the degree of importance of encoded block units. The video data transmission determiner 206 determines the transmission priority or whether to transmit the encoded video data according to the degree of importance stored in the degree of importance storage unit 204, considering the channel conditions such as the bandwidth of the wireless channel and the error probability of the channel. For example, if the amount of the video data to be transmitted per unit time exceeds the bandwidth of a wireless channel and the degree of importance of the current video data block is low, it is determined not to transmit the video data block or to lower the transmission priority. As another example, when the bandwidth of the channel available to a user is small, however, the user wishes video data of good quality to be transmitted, the video data transmission determiner 206 dotorminoo to transmit the data whose degree of importance is high and not to transmit or to transmit later the data whose degree of importance is low. The video data packetizing unit 208 divides the video data determined to be transmitted by the video data transmission determiner 206 into packets and adds information items such as a header to each packet. The wireless transmitter 210 transmits video<br>
packets through the wireless channel. The transmitted video packets are received by a receiver (not shown), processed in a reverse order to the order in which they are transmitted, decoded, and recovered.<br>
FIG. 3A is a block diagram of another embodiment of a wireless transmission system for video packet data according to the present invention. The wireless transmission system shown in FIG. 3A includes a video encoder 300, a degree of importance determiner 302, a degree of importance storage unit 304, a video data transmission determiner 306, a video and degree of importance data packetizing unit 312, and a wireless transmitter 310.<br>
Here, the operations of the video encoder 300, the degree of Importance determiner 302, the degree of importance storage unit 304, and the video data transmission determiner 306 are the same as the operations of the corresponding elements shown in FIG. 2.<br>
The video and degree of importance data packetizing unit 312 divides the data determined to be transmitted by the video data transmission determiner 306 into packets, adds information items such as the header to each packet, and inserts data on the degree of importance of the corresponding data block stored in the degree of importance storage unit 304 into the packet as one of the Information items. The wireless transmission unit 310 transmits the video packet into which the degree of importance data has been inserted<br>
FIG. 3B shows a receiving system for receiving the video packet transmitted from the wireless transmission system shown in FIG. 3A and decoding the received video packet.<br>
The wireless receiving system shown in FIG. 30 includes a wireless receiver 320, a packet assembly unit 322, and a weight decoder 324.<br>
The wireless receiver 320 receives the video packet. The packet assembly unit 322 extracts the video data from the received video packet, separates the inserted degree of importance data from the video data, and assembles the extracted video data. The weight decoder 324 decodes the video data by a decoding method, the complexity of which corresponds to the degree of importance of the corresponding video data. For example, when the received video data block has errors and the degree of importance of the received video data block is low, the<br>
block in which errors are generated is decoded and recovered by a well-known error concealment method. Since the degree of importance of the video data block is low, the video data block is decoded and recovered from the information items of blocks adjacent to the block in which errors are generated. When the degree of importance of the video data block is high, it is possible to conceal the errors using a method which has a better recovery performance.<br>
According to the present invention, it is possible to transmit video data, the amount of which is controlled for the fixed bandwidth of the wireless channel by determining the transmission priority or whether to transmit the video data by considering the degree of importance of the currently encoded video data. At this time, it is possible to select the complexity of the error concealment method to be adopted according to the degree of importance of the video data when the video data in which the errors are generated are recovered in the receiving system by transmitting data on the degree of importance of the video data together with the video data. Therefore, when the bandwidth of the allowed channel is small and the amount of data to be transmitted per unit time is large, it is possible to transmit the video data faster than the conventional technology, since the video data is not buffered.<br><br><br><br><br>
