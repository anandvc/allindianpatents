Substituted p-diaminobenzene derivatives<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to novel substituted p-diaminobenzene derivatives being openers of the KCNQ family potassium ion channels. The compounds are useful for the prevention, treatment and inhibition of disorders and diseases being responsive to opening of the KCNQ family potassium ion channels, one such disease is epilepsy.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Ion channels are cellular proteins that regulate the flow of ions, including potassium, calcium, chloride and sodium into and out of cells. Such channels are present in all animal and human cells and affect a variety of processes including neuronal transmission, muscle contraction, and cellular secretion.<br>
Humans have over 70 genes encoding potassium channel subunits (jentsch Nature Reviews Neuroscience 2000,1,21-30) with a great diversity with regard to both structure and function. Neuronal potassium channels, which are found in the brain, are primarily responsible for maintaining a negative resting membrane potential, as well as controlling membrane repolarisation following an action potential.<br>
One subset of potassium channel genes is the KCNQ family. Mutations in four out of five KCNQ genes have been shown to underlie diseases including cardiac arrhythmias, deafness and epilepsy (Jentsch Nature Reviews Neuroscience 2000,1, 21-30).<br>
The KCNQ4 gene is thought to encode the molecular correlate of potassium channels found in outer hair cells of the cochlea and in Type I hair cells of the vestibular apparatus, in which mutations can lead to a form of inherited dea&amp;ess.<br>
KCNQ1 (KvLQTl) is co-assembled with the product of the KCNE1 (minimal K(+&gt; channel protein) gene in the heart to form a cardiac-delayed rectifier-like K(+) current. Mutations in this channel can cause one form of inherited long QT syndrome type 1 (LQT1), as well as being associated with a form of dea&amp;ess (Robbins Pharmacol Ther 2001,90,1-19).<br><br>
The genes KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 were discovered in 1988 and appear to be mutated in an inherited fonn of epilepsy known as benign familial neonatal convulsions (Rogawski Trends in Neurosciences 2000,23,393-398). The proteins encoded by the KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 genes are localised in the pyramidal neurons of the human cortex and hippocampus, regions of the brain associated with seizure generation and propagation (Cooper et al. Proceedings National Academy of Science USA 2000,97, 4914-4919).<br>
KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 are two potassium channel subunits that form  "{M-currents" when expressed in vitro. The M-current is a non-inactivating potassium current found in many neuronal cell types. In each cell type, it is dominant in controlling membrane excitability by being the only sustained current in the range of action potential initiation (Marrion Annual Review Physiology 1997,59,483-504). Modulation of the M-current has dramatic effects on neuronal excitability, for example activation of the current will reduce neuronal excitability. Openers of these KCNQ channels, or activators of the M-current, will reduce excessive neuronal activity and may thus be of use in the treatment, prevention or inhibition of seizures and other diseases and disorders characterised by excessive neuronal activity, such as neuronal hyperexcitability including convulsive disorders, epilepsy and neuropathic pain.<br>
Retigabine (D-23129; N-(2-amino-4-(4-fluorobenzylamino)-phenyl) carbamic acid ethyl ester) and analogues thereof are disclosed in EP554543. Retigabine is an anticonvulsive compound with a broad spectrum and potent anticonvulsant properties, both in vitro and in vivo. It is active after oral and intraperitoneal administration in rats and mice in a range of anticonvulsant tests including: electrically induced seizures, seizures induced chemically by pentylenetetrazole, picrotoxin and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and in a genetic animal model, the DBA/2 mouse (Rostock et al. Epilepsy Research 1996,23,211-223). In addition, retigabine is active in the amygdala kindling model of complex partial seizures, further indicating that this compound has potential for anti-convulsive therapy. In clinical trials, retigabine has recently shown effectiveness in reducing the incidence of seizures in epileptic patients (Bialer et al. Epilepsy Research 2002,51,31-71).<br><br>
Retigabine has been shown to activate a K(+) current in neuronal cells and the pharmacology of tins induced current displays concordance with the published pharmacology of the M-channel, which recently was correlated to the KCNQ2/3 K(+) channel heteromultimer. This suggests that activation of KCNQ2/3 channels may be responsible for some of the anticonvulsant activity of this agent (Wickenden et al. Molecular Pharmacology 2000, 58, 591-600) - and that other agents working by the same mechanism may have similar uses.<br>
KCNQ 2 and 3 channels have also been reported to be upregulated in models of neuropathic pain (Wickenden et al. Society for Neuroscience Abstracts 2002,454.7), and potassium channel modulators have been hypothesised to be active in both neuropathic pain and epilepsy (Schroder et al Neuropharmacology 2001,40, 888-898).<br>
Retigabine has also been shown to be beneficial in animal models of neuropathic pain (Blackburn-Munro and Jensen European Journal of Pharmacology 2003,460,109-116), and it is thus suggested that openers of KCNQ channels will be of use in treating pain disorders including neuropathic pain.<br>
The localisation of KCNQ channel mRNA is reported in brain and other central nervous system areas associated with pain (Goldstein et al. Society for Neuroscience Abstracts 2003,53.8).<br>
In addition to a role in neuropathic pain, the expression of mRNA for KCNQ 2-5 in the trigeminal and dorsal root ganglia and in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis implies that openers of these channels may also affect the sensory processing of migraine pain (Goldstein et al. Society for Neuroscience Abstracts 2003, 53.8).<br>
Recent reports demonstrate that mRNA for KCNQ 3 and 5, in addition to that for KCNQ2, are expressed in astrocytes and glial cells. Thus KCNQ 2,3 and 5 channels may help modulate synaptic activity in the CNS and contribute to the neuroprotective effects of KCNQ channel openers (Noda et al, Society for Neuroscience Abstracts 2003, 53.9).<br><br>
Retigabine and other KCNQ modulators may thus exhibit protection against the neurodegenerative aspects of epilepsy, as retigabine has been shown to prevent limbic neurodegeneration and the expression of markers of apoptosis following kainic acid-induced status epilepticus in the rat (Ebert et al. Epilepsia 2002,43 Suppl 5, 86-95). This may have relevance for preventing the progression of epilepsy in patients, i.e. be anti-epileptogenic. Retigabine has also been shown to delay the progression of hippocampal kindling in the rat, a further model of epilepsy development (Tober et al. European Journal Of Pharmacology 1996, 303,163-169).<br>
It is thus suggested that these properties of retigabine and other KCNQ modulators may prevent neuronal damage induced by excessive neuronal activation, and may be of use in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, and be disease modifying (or antiepileptogenic) in patients with epilepsy.<br>
Given that anticonvulsant compounds such as benzodiazepines and chlormethiazole are used clincially in the treatment of the ethanol withdrawal syndrome and that other anticonvulsant compounds e.g. gabapentin, are very effective in animal models of this syndrome (Watson et al. Neuropharmacology 1997,36,1369-1375), other anticonvulsant compounds such as KCNQ openers are thus expected to be effective in this condition.<br>
mRNA for KCNQ 2 and 3 subunits are found in brain regions associated with anxiety and emotional behaviours such as bipolar disorder e.g. hippocampus and amygdala (Saganich et al. Journal of  Neuroscience 2001, 21,4609-4624), and retigabine is reportedly active in some animal models of anxiety-like behaviour (Hartz et al. Journal of  Psychopharmacology 2003,17 suppl 3, A28,B16), and other clinically used anticonvulsant compounds are used in the treatment of bipolar disorder.<br>
WO 200196540 discloses the use of modulators of the M-current formed by expression of KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 genes for insomnia, while WO 2001092526 discloses that modulators of KCNQ5 can be utilized for the treatment of sleep disorders.<br><br>
WO01/022953 describes the use of retigabine for prophylaxis and treatment of neuropathic pain such as allodynia, hyperalgesic pain, phantom pain, neuropathic pain related to diabetic neuropathy and neuropathic pain related to migraine.<br>
WO02/049628 describes the use of retigabine for the prevention, treatment, inhibition and amelioration of anxiety disorders such as anxiety, generalized anxiety disorder, panic anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder, social phobia, performance anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, acute stress reaction, adjustment disorders, hypochondriacal disorders, separation anxiety disorder, agoraphobia and specific phobias.<br>
WO97/15300 describes the use of retigabine for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease; Huntington's chorea; sclerosis such as multiple sclerosis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; Creutzfeld-Jakob disease; Parkinson's disease; encephalopathies induced by AIDS or infection by rubella viruses, herpes viruses, borreha and unknown pathogens; trauma-induced neurodegenerations; neuronal hyperexcitation states such as in medicament withdrawal or intoxication; and neurodegenerative diseases of the peripheral nervous system such as polyneuropathies and polyneuritides.<br>
Hence, there is a great desire for novel compounds, which are potent openers of the KCNQ family potassium channels.<br>
Also desired are novel compounds with improved properties relative to known compounds, which are openers of the KCNQ family potassium channels, such as retigabine. Improvement of one or more of the following parameters is desired: half-life, clearance, selectivity, interactions with other medications, bioavailability, potency, formulability, chemical stability, metabolic stability, membrane permeability, solubility and therapeutic index. The improvement of such parameters may lead to improvements such as:<br>
©    an improved dosing regime by reducing the number of required doses a day, o    ease of administration to patients on multiple medications,<br>
•	reduced side effects,<br>

Substituted 4-nitroanilines of the general formula IX or XI are commercially available, described in the literature or prepared according to methods known to chemists skilled in the art In particular, compounds of the general formula IX or XI with s being 0 and R2 being substituted aryl or substituted heteroaryl as defined above such as furanyl, thienyl, phenyl, pyridinyl can be prepared from corresponding compounds with R being I or Br by means of cross-coupling reactions known to chemists skilled in the art, such as Suzuki coupling, Stille coupling, or other transition metal catalyzed cross-coupling reactions [D.W. Knight "Coupling Reactions Between sp2 Carbon Centers" in Comprehensive Organic Synthesis, v. 3, pp. 481-520, Pergamon Press 1991]. Alternatively, 4-nitroanilines with the general formula IX or XI can be prepared from the corresponding 2-substituted aniline in the protected or unprotected form by nitration known to chemists skilled in the art [R. Behnisch " Aromatische Nitro-Verbindungen" in Methoden der Organische Chemie/(Houben-Weyl) p. 255, v. E16d, Thieme: 1992], In particular, this method can be applied for compounds with the general formula IX or XI where U is S, SO2, or SO2NR11. Also, compounds of the general formula IX or XI where U is S can be converted into compounds of the general formula IX or XI where U is SO2 by oxidation according to methods known to the chemist skilled in the art, for example by oxidation with 3-chloroperoxybenzoic acid or NaI04 in the presence of RUCI3 as a catalyst.<br>
Compounds of the general formula XI are also prepared from compounds of general formula IX by the reaction with suitable electrophilic reagents forming an R3-(Z)q-X group, such as, but not limited to, alkyl, aryl, or heteroaryl chloroformiates or carbamoyl chlorides, carbonic acid anhydrides, acid fluorides, acid chlorides, acid bromides, acid iodides, activated esters, activated carbonic acids with activating reagents such as carbodiimides, sulfonyl chlorides, or isocyanates in suitable solvents, such as acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran, 1,2-dichloroethane, or methylene chloride, at a suitable temperature, such as room temperature or reflux, achieved by conventional heating or under microwave irradiation, with or without addition of bases, such<br><br>
magnesium oxide, potassium carbonate, sodium hydride, trialkylamines, sodium- or potassium alcoholates, sodium or potassium carbonate, sodium or potassium bicarbonate, or pyridine, reactions well known to the chemist skilled in the art.<br>
Additionally, for further variation of R2, compounds of the general formula XI, wherein R2 is methyl, U is oxygen, and s is 1, can be demethylated by methods known to chemists skilled in the art, such as treatment with boron tribromide in a suitable solvent, such as dichloromethane, at a suitable temperature, such as 0 °C or room temperature. The resulting phenols can then be transformed into compounds of the general formula XI, wherein U is oxygen, and s is 1, by methods known to chemists skilled in the art. Such methods include: (a) the reaction with electrophiles, such as alkyl chlorides, alkyl bromides, alkyl iodides, benzyl chlorides, benzyl bromides, benzyl iodides, carbonic acid chlorides, carbonic acid bromides, or carbonic acid anhydrides in the presence of suitable bases, such as potassium carbonate, in a suitable solvent, such ' as tetrahydrofuran, N,N-dimethylformamide, or 1,2-dichloroethane, at suitable temperatures, such as room temperature or reflux temperature; (b) the reaction with alkyl, benzylic, or heteroarylalkyl alkohols under conditions known as the Mitsunobu reaction (O. Mitsunobu Synthesis 1981,1).<br>
The nitro group in compounds of the general formula XI can be reduced with suitable reducing agents such as zinc or iron powder in the presence of acid such as acetic acid or aqueous hydrochloric acid, or hydrogen gas or ammonium formiate in the presence of suitable hydrogenation catalyst such as palladium on activated carbon in suitable solvents such as methanol, ethanol, or tetrahydrofuran, at suitable temperatures or under ultrasonic irradiation, to obtain anilines with the general formula XII. Alternatively, tin (II) chloride or sodium dithionite can be used as reducing agents under conditions well known to the chemist skilled in the art.<br>
Obtained anilines with the general formula XII are subjected to reductive alkylation i reactions, known to chemists skilled in the art, with aldehydes of the general formula YCHO where Y is defined as above in suitable solvents such as methanol, ethanol, xylene, tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile, or mixtures thereof, at suitable temperatures with the formation of intermediate imines which can be reduced in situ or can be separated by evaporation of the solvent or crystallisation. They are reduced to the compounds of<br><br>
the invention of the general formula I, where R1 is hydrogen, with reducing agents, such as sodium borohydrate or sodium cyanoborohydrate, in a suitable solvent, such as ethanol, methanol or acetonitrile with or without addition of catalytic amounts of acid, such as acetic acid, at suitable temperatures.<br>
Optionally, for variation of R1, the obtained compounds of the general formula I where R1 is hydrogen can be further derivatized by the second reductive alkylation procedure using suitable aldehydes and reducing agents such as sodium cyanoborohydrate, as described above. This procedure can be performed in situ after the first reductive alkylation with aldehydes of the general formula YCHO. Alternatively, R1 can be introduced by the electrophilic substitution reaction with the appropriate electrophiles of the general formula Ra-LG, where LG is a suitable leaving group such as iodide, bromide, or sulphonate under conditions known to the chemist skilled in the art.<br>
For the further variation of R3, Z and X, the compounds of the invention with the general formula I can be obtained by an alternative route:<br>
Compounds with the general formula XIII may be prepared by protection of the aniline nitrogen in the substituted 4-nitro anilines with the general formula IX with an appropriate protecting group (PG1) [Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3rd Edition T. W. Greene, P. G. M. Wuts, Wiley Interscience 1999], such as a trifloroacetyl group known to chemists skilled in the art as TFA group, by reaction with the reagent forming the protective group such as trifluoroacetic acid anhydride in a suitable solvent, such as 1,2-dichloroethane at appropriate temperatures.<br>
Anilines with the general formula XIV are obtained by reduction of the nitro group according to methods known to chemists skilled in the art, as described above. Then they are subjected to the reductive alkylation reactions as described above, with the aldehydes of the general formula YCHO to furnish compounds with the general formula XV.<br>
Compounds with the general formula XV are subjected to the second reductive alkylation step, as described above, to furnish compounds with the general formula<br><br>
XVI, where PG1 is TFA. Then the TFA group can be removed by methods known to chemists skilled in the art, such as hydrolysis with aqueous potassium carbonate in an appropriate solvent, such as methanol, at a suitable temperature, furnishing compounds of the general formula XVII.<br>
The compounds of the invention with the general formula I where R1 is not hydrogen are obtained from anilines with the general formula XVII by the reaction with suitable electrophilic reagents forming a R3-(Z)q-X group such as alkyl, aryl or heteroaryl chloroformates or carbamoyl chlorides, acid chlorides, acid bromides, acid iodides, sulfonyl chlorides, isocyanates, carbonic acid anhydrides, activated carbonic acids with activating reagents such as carbodimides or others as known to chemists skilled in the art, in the suitable solvents, such as acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran, 1,2-dichloroethane, or methylene chloride at a suitable temperature, such as room temperature or reflux, with or without addition of bases, such as magnesium oxide, potassium carbonate, trialkylamines, or pyridine, or other methods as descibed above.<br>
For the compounds of the invention with general formula I wherein R: is hydrogen, compounds with the general formula XV are subjected to the protection with appropriate protective group (PG2), known to chemists skilled in the art [Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3rd Edition T. W. Greene, P. G. M. Wuts, Wiley Interscience 1999], to furnish compounds with the general formula XVTH. In particular, compounds of the general formula XVBI where PG2 is tert-butylcarbonyl group, known to chemists skilled in the art as Boc group, can be prepared with the appropriate reagent forming protective group such as terf-butyl carbonic acid anhydride in an appropriate solvent such as acetonitrile and at appropriate temperature such as +80°C, to furnish compounds of the general formula XVIII where PG2 is Boc. Then the TFA protective group (PG1) is removed, as described above, to furnish compounds with the general formula XIX, followed by derivatisation with appropriate electrophiles forming R3~(Z)q-X group to furnish compounds with the general formula XX, as described above.<br>
Alternatively, compounds of the general formula XIX can be prepared from 4-nitroanilines in three steps as follows: reductive alkylation of compounds of the general formula XXXIV as described above will furnish compounds of the general formula XXXV, which can then be protected e.g. using di-tert-butyldicarbonate and<br><br>
dimethylaminopyridine in a suitable solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, thus yielding compounds of the general formula XXXVI, which can then be reduced to compounds of the general formula XIX by an appropriate reducing agent such as Na2S2O4 as described above.<br>
Finally, the compounds of the invention with general formula I wherein R1 is hydrogen are obtained from the compounds with the general formula XX by means of deprotection of PG2 by the methods known to chemists skilled in the art.In particular, the Boc protective group can be cleaved by the methods known to chemists skilled in the art such as deprotection with an appropriate acid, for example trifluoroacetic acid, in the absence or presence of solvent such as methylene chloride or toluene at appropriate temperatures.<br>
Alternatively, compounds of the general formula I can be prepared by a route as follows:<br>
Compounds of the general formula XXI, wherein R2, U, and s are as defined above, are commercially available or prepared by methods known to the chemist skilled in the art. These include the reactions of 5-fluoro-2-nitrophenol under Mitsunobu-, alkylation- or acylation conditions as described above for the synthesis of compounds of the general formula XI from phenols. Nucleophilic aromatic substitution with amines of the type Y-CH2-NH-R1, a reaction well known to chemists skilled in the art, furnishes compounds with the general formula XXII. Alternatively, compounds with the general formula XXII can be prepared by reductive alkylation as described above of 4-nitroanilines of the general formula XXXIV. Compounds with the general formula XXIII may be prepared by the reduction of the nitro group, carried out under the conditions as described above for the synthesis of compounds of the general structures XII. The reaction of compounds with the the general formula XXIII with suitable electrophilic reagents forming an R3-(Z)q-X group, as described above for compounds of the general formula XI, furnishes the compounds of the invention with the general formula I.<br>
Alternatively, compounds of the general formula I with s being 0 and R2 being substituted aryl or substituted heteroaryl as defined above such as furanyl, thienyl, phenyl, pyridinyl can be prepared from the corresponding compounds with R2 being I or Br by means of cross-coupling reactions, as described above.<br><br>
