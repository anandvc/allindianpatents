SUBSTITUTED IMIDAZO RING SYSTEMS AND METHODS<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS The present application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Serial No. 60/524961, filed on November 25, 2003, and to U.S. Provisional Application Serial No. 60/580139, filed on June 16, 2004, both of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
In the 1950's the lH-imidazo[4,5-c]quinoline ring system was developed and l-(6-methoxy-8-quinolinyl)-2-methyl-l-imidazo[4,5-c]quinoline was synthesized for possible use as an antimalarial agent. Subsequently, syntheses of various substituted lH-imidazo[4,5-c] quinolines were reported. For example, l-[2-(4-piperidyl)ethyl]-lH-imidazo[4,5-c]quinoline was synthesized as a possible anticonvulsant and cardiovascular agent. Also, several 2-oxoimidazo[4,5-c]quinolines have been reported.<br>
Certain lH-imidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-4-amines and 1- and 2-substituted derivatives thereof were later found to be useful as antiviral agents, bronchodilators and immunomodulators. Subsequently, certain substituted 1H-imidazo[4,5-c]pyridin-4-amine, quinolin-4-amine, tetrahydroquinolin-4-amine, naphthyridin-4-amine, and tetrahydronaphthyridin-4-amine compounds as well as certain analogous thiazolo and oxazolo compounds were synthesized and found to be useful as immune response modifiers (IRMs), rendering them useful in the treatment of a variety of disorders.<br>
There continues to be interest in the imidazoquinoline ring system, and other ring systems, and there is a continuing need for compounds that have the ability to modulate the immune response, by induction of cytokine biosynthesis or other mechanisms.<br><br>
SUMMARY<br>
The present invention provides a new class of compounds that are useful in inducing cytokine biosynthesis in animals. Such compounds are of the following Formula (I):<br><br>
1-1<br>
wherein: Z is -C(O)-, -C(0)O, or -C(-Q-R1-3)2-; and wherein: X, RA, RB&gt; R2&gt; RI-I&gt; Q&gt; and R1_3 are as defined below.<br>
The compounds of Formula 1-1 are useful as immune response modifiers due to their ability to induce cytokine biosynthesis (e.g., induces the synthesis of at least one cytokine) and otherwise modulate the immune response when administered to animals. This makes the compounds useful in the treatment of a variety of conditions such as viral diseases and tumors that are responsive to such changes in the immune response.<br>
The invention further provides pharmaceutical compositions containing an effective amount of a compound of Formula 1-1 and methods of inducing cytokine biosynthesis in an animal, treating a viral infection and/or treating a neoplastic disease in an animal by administering an effective amount of a compound of Formula 1-1 to the animal.<br>
In addition, methods of synthesizing compounds of Formula 1-1 and intermediates useful in the synthesis of these compounds are provided.<br>
As used herein, "a," "an," "the," "at least one," and "one or more" are used interchangeably.<br>
The terms "comprises" and variations thereof do not have a limiting meaning where these terms appear in the description and claims.<br>

As used herein, the terms "alkyl," "alkenyl," "alkynyl" and the prefix "alk-" are inclusive of both straight chain and branched chain groups and of cyclic groups, i.e. cycloalkyl and cycloalkenyl. Unless otherwise specified, these groups contain from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, with alkenyl groups containing from 2 to 20 carbon atoms, and alkynyl groups containing from 2 to 20 carbon atoms. In some embodiments, these groups have a total of up to 10 carbon atoms, up to 8 carbon atoms, up to 6 carbon atoms, or up to 4 carbon atoms. Cyclic groups can be monocyclic or polycyclic and preferably have from 3 to 10 ring carbon atoms. Exemplary cyclic groups include cyclopropyl, cyclopropylmethyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, adamantyl, and substituted and unsubstituted bornyl, norbornyl, and norbomenyl.<br>
Unless otherwise specified, "alkylene," "alkenylene," and "alkynylene" are the divalent forms of the "alkyl," "alkenyl," and "alkynyl" groups defined above. The terms, "alkylenyl," "alkenylenyl," and "alkynylenyl" are use when "alkylene," "alkenylene," and "alkynylene," respectively, are substituted. For example, an arylalkylenyl group comprises an alkylene moiety to which an aryl group is attached.<br>
The term "haloalkyl" is inclusive of groups that are substituted by one or more halogen atoms, including perfluorinated groups. This is also true of other<br><br>
groups that include the prefix "halo-." Examples of suitable haloalkyl groups are chloromethyl, trifluoromethyl, and the like.<br>
The term "aryl" as used herein includes carbocyclic aromatic rings or ring systems. Examples of aryl groups include phenyl, naphthyl, biphenyl, fluorenyl and indenyl.<br>
Unless otherwise indicated, the term "heteroatom" refers to the atoms O, S, or N.<br>
The term "heteroaryl" includes aromatic rings or ring systems that contain at least one ring heteroatom (e.g., O, S, N). Suitable heteroaryl groups include furyl, thienyl, pyridyl, quinolinyl, isoquinolinyl, indolyl, isoindolyl, triazolyl, pyrrolyl, tetrazolyl, imidazolyl, pyrazolyl, oxazolyl, thiazolyl, benzofaranyl, benzothiophenyl, carbazolyl, benzoxazolyl, pyrimidinyl, benzimidazolyl, quinoxalinyl, benzothiazolyl, naphthyridinyl, isoxazolyl, isothiazolyl, purinyl, quinazolinyl, pyrazinyl, 1-oxidopyridyl, pyridazinyl, triazinyl, tetrazinyl, oxadiazolyl, thiadiazolyl, and so on.<br>
The term "heterocyclyl" includes non-aromatic rings or ring systems that contain at least one ring heteroatom (e.g., O, S, N) and includes all of the fully saturated and partially unsaturated derivatives of the above mentioned heteroaryl groups. Exemplary heterocyclic groups include pyrrolidinyl, tetrahydrofuranyl, morpholinyl, thiomorpholinyl, piperidinyl, piperazinyl, thiazolidinyl, imidazolidinyl, isothiazolidinyl, tetrahydropyranyl, quinuclidinyl, homopiperidinyl (azepanyl), homopiperazinyl (diazepanyl), 1,3-dioxolanyl, aziridinyl, dihydroisoquinolin-(lH)-yl, octahydroisoquinolin-(lH)-yl, dihydroquinolin-(2H)-yl,octahydroquinolin-(2H)-yl, dihydro-1H-imidazolyl, and the like. When "heterocyclyl" contains a nitrogen atom, the point of attachment of the heterocyclyl group may be the nitrogen atom.<br>
The terms "arylene," "heteroarylene," and "heterocyclylene" are the divalent forms of the "aryl," "heteroaryl," and "heterocyclyl' groups defined above. The terms, "arylenyl," "heteroarylenyl," and "heterocyclylenyl" are used when "arylene," "heteroarylene," and "heterocyclylene," respectively, are substituted. For example, an alkylarylenyl group comprises an arylene moiety to which an alkyl group is attached.<br><br>
When a group (or substituent or variable) is present more than once in any Formula described herein, each group (or substituent or variable) is independently selected, whether explicitly stated or not. For example, for the formula -N(R3)2 each R3 group is independently selected. In a further example, when more than one Ri_3 group is present and each R]_3 group contains one or more R1.4 groups, then each R1-3 group is independently selected, and each R1-4 group is independently selected.<br>
The invention is inclusive of the compounds described herein in any of their phaimaceutically acceptable forms, including isomers (e.g., diastereomers and enantiomers), salts, solvates, polymorphs, and the like. In particular, if a compound is optically active, the invention specifically includes each of the compound's enantiomers as well as racemic mixtures of the enantiomers.

In step (1) of Reaction Scheme la, a 4-chloro-3-nitroquinoline of Formula VI is treated with an amino alcohol in the presence of triethylamine in a suitable solvent such as dichloromethane, wherein the amino alcohol is of the general formula H2N-X-CH2-OH and X is as defined herein. Numerous amino alcohols of the formula H2N-X-CH2-OH are commercially available; others can be readily synthesized using well-known methods. Many 4-chloro-3-nitroquinolines of Formula VI are known or can be prepared using known synthetic methods, see for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 4,689,338; 5,175,296; 5,367,076; and 5,389,640; and the references cited therein.<br>
The resultant compound of Formula VII can be reduced in step (2) of Reaction Scheme la using a variety of methods to provide a quinoIine-3,4-diamine of Formula VIII, The reaction can be carried out by hydrogenation using a heterogeneous hydrogenation catalyst such as platinum on carbon. The hydrogenation is conveniently carried out in a Parr apparatus in a suitable solvent such as toluene or ethanol. The reaction can be carried out at ambient temperature, and the product can be isolated using conventional methods.<br>
Alternatively, step (2) can be carried out using a one- or two-phase sodium dithionite reduction. The reaction is conveniently carried out using the conditions described by Park, K. K.; Oh, C. H.; and Joung, W. K-; Tetrahedron Lett. 1993,34, 7445-7446 by adding sodium dithionite to a compound of Formula VH in a mixture of dichloromethane and water at ambient temperature in the presence of potassium carbonate and ethyl viologen dibromide. The product can be isolated using conventional methods.<br>
In step (3) of Reaction Scheme la, a quinoline-3,4-diamine of Formula VDI is treated with a carboxylic acid equivalent to provide a lH-irnidazo[4,5-c]quinoline of Formula IX. Suitable caiboxylic acid equivalents include orthoesters of Formula R2C(O-alkyI)3,1,1-dialkoxyalkyl alkanoates of Formula R2C(O-alkyl)2(O-C(O)-alkyl), and acid chlorides of Formula R2C(O)C1. The selection of the carboxylic acid equivalent is determined by the desired substituent at R2, For example, triethyl orthoformate will provide a compound where R2 is hydrogen, and trimethyl orthovalerate will provide a compound<br><br>
where R2 is a butyl group. The reaction is conveniently carried out by adding the carboxylic acid equivalent to a quinoline-3,4-diamine of Formula VIII in a suitable solvent such as toluene or xylenes. Optionally, catalytic pyridine hydrochloride or pyridium/Holuenesulfonate can be added.

The Grignard reagent is of the formula Ri_]MgHalide to form a compound of Formula XL Several of these reagents are commercially available; others can be prepared using known synthetic methods. The reaction is conveniently carried out by adding a solution of the Grignard reagent to a solution of the compound of Formula X in a suitable solvent such as tetrahydrofuran.

using conventional methods. The reaction is conveniently carried out under Swern conditions, described in step (4) above.<br>
In step (7) of Reaction Scheme la, a ketone-substituted lff-imidazo[4,5-cjquinoline of Formula XII is oxidized to provide an N-oxide of Formula XKt using a conventional oxidizing agent capable of forming such compounds. For example, the reaction can be conveniently carried out by adding 3-chloroperoxybenzoic acid to a solution of a compound of Formula XII in a solvent, such as chloroform or dichloromethane, at ambient temperature.<br>
In step (8) of Reaction Scheme la, the 1H-oxide of Formula Xm is aminated to provide a ketone-substituted lH-imidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-4-amine of Formula la. Step (8) involves the activation of an TV-oxide of Formula XEH by conversion to an ester and then reacting the ester with an aminating agent. Suitable activating agents include alkyl- or arylsulfonyl chlorides such as benzenesulfonyl chloride, methanesulfonyl chloride, or&gt;-toluenesulfonyl chloride. Suitable aminating agents include ammonia, in the form of ammonium hydroxide, for example, and ammonium salts such as ammonium carbonate, ammonium bicarbonate, and ammonium phosphate. The reaction is conveniently carried out by adding ammonium hydroxide to a solution of the N-oxide of Formula XIII in a suitable solvent, such as dichloromethane or chloroform, and then adding -toluenesulfonyl chloride. The reaction can be carried out at ambient temperature. The resultant ketone-substituted \H-imidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-4-amines of Formula la or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof can be isolated from the reaction mixture using conventional methods.<br><br><br>

Corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) or hormone (CRH) is one of several neurohoimones synthesized by specific hypothalamic nuclei in the brain where it activates the transcription of the pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) gene resulting in release of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and beta-endorphin froin anterior pituitary cells (Vale et aL_ Science 213, 1394-1397 (1981)). Hie fundamental role of CRF is to prepare the organism for an appropriate response to various stressors such as physical trauma, insults of the imniune system and social interactions. CRF also has CNS effects by acting at higher centers in the brain, particularly cortical regions where there is a widespread distribution of CRF neurons. CRF is believed to be a key intermediary in communication between the immune, central nervous, endocrine and cardiovascular S3'stems (Sapolsky et al, Science 1H 522-524 (1987)). The role played by CRF in integrating the response of the immune system to physiological, psychological and imrn'onologicel stressors has been described m the art5 e.g. IE. Blalock, Physiological<br>

In steps (3) through (5) of Reaction Scheme 2b, an alcohol of Formula XI is oxidized using conventional methods to a ketone-substituted 1H-imidazo[4,5-c]quinoline of Formula XII, which is converted to a N-oxi&amp;e of Formula Xm. The compound of Formula XIII is then animated to provide a ketone-substituted lH-imidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-4-amine of Formula la. Steps (3), (4), and (5) of Reaction Scheme 2b can be carried out as described for steps (6), (7), and (8) of Reaction Scheme la.<br><br>
Reaction Scheme 3<br>
Ketals and acetals of the invention can be prepared according to Reaction Scheme 3. Step (1) of Reaction Scheme 3 involves the conversion of a ketone or aldehyde of Formula XII to a ketal or acetal of Formula XDC by reaction with a compound of Formula H-Q-R1.3 or H-Q-Ri_3-Q-H. The reaction can be carried out by treating a ketone or aldehyde of Formula XII with a compound of Formula H-Q-R1.3-Q-H or two equivalents of a compound of Formula H-Q-R1.3 in the presence of an acid catalyst. Conditions for this reaction are well known to one skilled in the art. See, for example, Greene, T. W.; Wuts, P. G. M.<br><br>
Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.: New York, 2nd Ed, 1991, p. 178.<br>
In step (2) of Reaction Scheme 3, a compound of Formula XXII is oxidized to a lH-imidazo[4,5-c]quinoline-5ALoxide of Formula XXIII, which is then aminated to a li/-imidazo[4,5-c]quinoIin-4-amine of Formula Id. Steps (2) and (3) of Reaction Scheme 3 can be carried out as steps (7) and (8) of Reaction Scheme la. The product or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof can be isolated using conventional methods.<br>
Alternatively, ketones of Formula la can be converted to ketals of Formula Id by the reaction described in step (1) of Reaction Scheme 3.<br><br>
Reaction Scheme 4<br>
Compounds of Formula la and Formula Ie can be prepared according to Reaction Scheme 4. In step (1) of Reaction Scheme 4, a 4-chloro-3-nitroquinoline of Formula VI is reacted with a compound of the formula H2N-X-C(O)(O-Ri-i) - HC1 to form a compound of Formula XXIV. This reaction is<br><br>
conveniently carried out in the presence of triethylamine in a suitable solvent, such as dichloromethane. Compounds of the formula H2N-X-C(O)(O- Ri-0 -HC1 can be commercially obtained or readily synthesized using conventional methods. For example, the amino ester wherein R\.\ is ethyl and X is propylene or dodecylene can be synthesized according to the procedure of C. Temple et al., J. Med. Chem., 1988,57, 697-700.<br>
In steps (2) and (3) of Reaction Scheme 4, a compound of Formula<br>
XXIV	is reduced to form a quinoline-3,4-diamine of Formula IV, which can be<br>
cyclized with a carboxylic acid equivalent to form a lH-imidazo[4,5-c]quinoline<br>
of Formula XXV. Steps (2) and (3) of Reaction Scheme 4 can be carried out as<br>
described for steps (2) and (3) of Reaction Scheme la.<br>
In step (4), the ester group of a 177-imidazo[4,5-c]quinoline Formula<br>
XXV	is converted to a Weinreb amide to provide a 1H-imidazo[4,5-c]quinoline<br>
of Formula XXVI. The transformation can be carried out by base-promoted<br>
hydrolysis of the ester to form a carboxylic acid, conversion to an acid chloride<br>
using conventional methods, and finally treating the acid chloride with N,O-<br>
dimethylhydroxylamine hydrochloride to form a Weinreb amide of Formula<br>
XXVI. The base-promoted hydrolysis is conveniently carried out by adding<br>
sodium hydroxide to an ester-substituted lH-imidazo[4,5-c]quinoline Formula<br>
XXV in a suitable solvent such as ethanol. The reaction can be carried out at<br>
ambient temperature, and the product can be isolated using conventional<br>
methods. The conversion of the resulting carboxylic acid to an acid chloride is<br>
conveniently earned out by slowly adding oxalyl chloride to a solution of the<br>
caiboxylic acid in a suitable solvent such as dichloromethane. The reaction can<br>
be carried out at a sub-ambient temperature, such as 0°C. The resulting acid<br>
chloride can then be treated with A^O-dimethylhydroxylamine hydrochloride<br>
followed by triethylamine in a suitable solvent such as dichloromethane. The<br>
reaction can be run at ambient temperature, and the product of Formula XXVI<br>
can be isolated using conventional methods.<br>
Alternatively, step (4) can be carried out in one step by treating an ester-substituted li/-imidazo[4,5-c]quinoline Formula XXV with an aluminum reagent made from trimethylaluminum and N,O-dimethylhydroxylamine<br><br>
hydrochloride.

Pharmaceutical Compositions and Biological Activity<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention contain a therapeutically effective amount of a compound or salt of the invention as described above in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
The terms "a therapeutically effective amount" and "effective amount" mean an amount of the compound or salt sufficient to induce a therapeutic or prophylactic effect, such as cytokine induction, immunomodulation, antitumor activity, and/or antiviral activity. Although the exact amount of active compound or salt used in a pharmaceutical composition of the invention will vary according to factors known to those of skill in the art, such as the physical<br><br>
and chemical nature of the compound or salt, the nature of the carrier, and the intended dosing regimen, it is anticipated that the compositions of the invention will contain sufficient active ingredient to provide a dose of about 100 nanograms per kilogram (ng/kg) to about 50 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg), preferably about 10 micrograms per kilogram (|ig/kg) to about 5 mg/kgs of the compound or salt to the subject. A variety of dosage forms may be used, such as tablets, lozenges, capsules, parenteral formulations, syrups, creams, ointments, aerosol formulations, transdermal patches, transmucosal patches and the like.<br>
The compounds or salts of fee invention can be administered as the single therapeutic agent in the treatment regimen, or the compounds or salts of the invention may be administered in combination with .one another or with other active agents, including additional immune response modifiers, antivirals, antibiotics, antibodies, proteins, peptides, oligonucleotides, etc.<br>
Compounds or salts of the invention have been shown to induce the production of certain cytokines in experiments performed according to the test set forth below. These results indicate that the compounds or salts are useful as immune response modifiers that can modulate the immune response in a number of different ways, rendering them useful in the treatment of a variety of disorders.<br>
Cytokines whose production may be induced by the administration of compounds or salts of the invention generally include interferon-a (IFN-a) and/or tumor necrosis factor-ct (TNF-a) as well as certain interleukins (IL). Cytokines whose biosynthesis may be induced by compounds or salts of the invention include IFN-a, TNF-a, IL-1, IL-6, IL-10 and IL-12, and a variety of other cytokines. Among other effects, these and other cytokines can inhibit virus production and tumor cell growth, making the compounds or salts useful in the treatment of viral diseases and neoplastic diseases. Accordingly, the invention provides a method of inducing cytokine biosynthesis in an animal comprising administering an effective amount of a compound or salt or composition of the invention to the animal. The animal to which the compound or salt or composition is administered for induction of cytokine biosynthesis may have a disease as described infra, for example a viral disease or a neoplastic disease,<br><br>
and administration of the compound or salt may provide therapeutic treatment. Alternatively, the compound or salt may be administered to the animal prior to the animal acquiring the disease so that administration of the compound or salt may provide a prophylactic treatment<br>
.   In addition to the ability to induce the production of cytokines, compounds or salts of the invention can affect other aspects of the innate immune response. For example, natural killer cell activity may be stimulated, an effect that may be due to cytokine induction. The compounds or salts may also activate macrophages, which in turn stimulate secretion of nitric oxide and the production of additional cytokines. Further, the compounds or salts may cause proliferation and differentiation of B-lymphocytes.<br>
Compounds or salts of the invention can also have an effect on the acquired immune response. For example, the production of the T helper type 1 (TH1) cytokine IFN-y may be induced indirectly and the production of the T helper type 2 (TH2) cytokines IL-4, IL-5 and EL-13 may be inhibited upon administration of the compounds or salts.<br>
Whether for prophylaxis or therapeutic treatment of a disease, and whether for effecting innate or acquired immunity, the compound or salt or composition may be administered alone or in combination with one or more active components as in, for example, a vaccine adjuvant. When administered with other components, the compound or salt and other component or components maybe administered separately; together but independently such as in a solution; or together and associated with one another such as (a) covalently linked or (b) non-covalently associated, e.g., in a colloidal suspension.<br>

Thus, one or more of the above diseases or types of diseases, for example, a viral disease or a neoplastic disease may be treated in an animal in need thereof (having the disease) by administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound or salt of the invention to the animal.<br>
An amount of a compound or salt effective to induce cytokine biosynthesis is an amount sufficient to cause one or more cell types, such as monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells and B-cells to produce an amount of one or more cytokines such as, for example, IFN-a, TNF-a, IL-1, IL-6, EL-10 and EL-12 that is increased (induced) over a background level of such cytokines. The precise amount will vary according to factors known in the art but is expected to be a dose of about 100 ng/kg to about 50 mg/kg, preferably about 10 p.g/kg to about 5 mg/kg. The invention also provides a method of treating a viral infection in an animal and a method of treating a neoplastic disease in an animal comprising administering an effective amount of a compound or salt or composition of the invention to the animal. An amount effective to treat or<br><br>
inhibit a viral infection is an amount that will cause a reduction in one or more of the manifestations of viral infection, such as viral lesions, viral load, rate of virus production, and mortality as compared to untreated control animals. The precise amount that is effective for such treatment will vary according to factors known in the art but is expected to be a dose of about 100 ng/kg to about 50 mg/kg, preferably about 10 ng/kg to about 5 mg/kg. An amount of a compound or salt effective to treat a neoplastic condition is an amount that will cause a reduction in tumor size or in the number of tumor foci.   Again, the precise amount will vary according to factors known in the art but is expected to be a dose of about 100 ng/kg to about 50 mg/kg, preferably about 10 jxg/kg to about 5 mg/kg.<br>

Stepl:<br>
To a stirred mixture of 4-chloro-3-nitroquinoline (100.0 g, 479 mmol) and triethylamine (72.8 g, 719 mmol) in dichloromethane (700 mL) was added dropwise 4-amino-l-butanol (42.7 g, 479 mmol). After the addition was complete, water (500 mL) was added to the reaction mixture to cause the product to precipitate. More water (2 L) was added, and the mixture was stirred<br><br>
overnight and then filtered. The organic solution was dried over sodium sulfate, concentrated under reduced pressure, and combined with the product isolated by filtration to provide 4-(3-nitroquinoIin-4-ylamino)butan-l-ol (113 g) as a bright yellow solid.<br>

After 3.5 hours, additional triethylamine (19.0 g, 188 mmol) and TBDMSC1 (20.2 g, 134 mmol) were added and the mixture stirred overnight. After the addition of additional TBDMSC1 (4.0 g, 27 mmol), the reaction was complete as judged by thin layer chromatography (TLC). Chloroform (900 mL) was added and the mixture washed successively with 360 mL each of a 0.10 N hydrochloric acid solution, a saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution, and brine; dried over sodium sulfate; filtered; and solvent evaporated to leave a mixture of [4-(erf-butyldimethylsilanyloxy)butyI](3-nitro-quinolin-4-yl)amine and tert-butyldimethylsilanol (117 g total, about 65:35 mol:mol) which was used in the next step without further purification.<br>

After five minutes triethylamine (20.42 g, 202 mmol) was added, and the mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature. After the addition of chloroform (500 mL), the mixture was washed successively with a saturated ammonium chloride solution (200 mL) and a saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution (200 mL), dried over sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated to a dark solid.

After 30 minutes, the solution was quenched with saturated ammonium chloride (100 mL), diluted with ethyl acetate (300 mL), and the layers separated. The organic solution was washed successively with a saturated aqueous sodium<br><br>
bicarbonate solution (100 mL) and brine (100 mL), dried over sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated to a light orange oil. Chromatography on silica gel (elution with 5% methanol in dichloromethane) provided 4-(2*butyl-l^-imidazo^jS-cjquinolin-l-yO-l-phenylbutan-l-ol (4.3 g) as a light orange, gummy solid.<br>

After 1 hour, the reaction was not complete as judged by TLC, so an additional charge of m-CPBA (1.0 g) was added. After stirring for 30 minutes, the mixture was diluted with chloroform (200 mL), washed successively with a saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution (2 x 100 mL) and brine (100 mL), dried over sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated to provide 4~(2-butyl-5-oxido-li/-imidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-l-yl)-l-phenylbutan-1-one as a dark oil that was used directly in the next step without further purification.<br>

dichloromethane (49 mL) and ammonium hydroxide (16 mL) was added p-toluenesulfonyl chloride (2.34 g, 12.3 mmol) portionwise over several minutes. After 15 minutes the reaction mixture was diluted with chloroform (200 mL) and saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution (100 mL). The layers were separated and the organic phase was washed again with a saturated aqueous sodium bicaibonate solution (100 mL). The aqueous portions were then back extracted with chloroform (50 mL). The organics were combined, dried over sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated to a dark yellow solid. The dark yellow solid was slurried in diethyl ether and filtered to form a fine off-white solid. This solid was recrystallized from W, Af-dimethylfonnamide (DMF) and water to afford 4-(4-amino-2-butyl-1H-imidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-l-yl)-l-phenylbutan-1-one as an off-white fluffy solid, mp 178-180 °C.

CYTOKINE INDUCTION IN HUMAN CELLS Compounds of the invention have been found to induce cytokine biosynthesis when tested using the method described below.<br>
An in vitro human blood cell system is used to assess cytokine induction. Activity is based on the measurement of interferon and tumor necrosis factor (a) (EFN and TNF, respectively) secreted into culture media as described by Testerman et. al. in "Cytokine Induction by the Immunomodulators Imiquimod and S-27609", Journal of Leukocyte Biology, 58, 365-372 (September, 1995).<br>
Blood Cell Preparation for Culture<br>
ole blood from healthy human donors is collected by venipuncture into EDTA vacutainer tubes. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) are separated from whole blood by density gradient centrifugation using HISTOPAQUE-1077. Blood is diluted 1:1 with Dulbecco's Phosphate Buffered Saline (DPBS) or Hank's Balanced Salts Solution (HBSS). The PBMC layer is collected and washed twice with DPBS or HBSS and resuspended at 4 x 106 cells/mL in RPMI complete. The PBMC suspension is added to 48 well flat bottom sterile tissue culture plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA or Becton Dickinson Labware, Lincoln Park, NJ) containing an equal volume of RPMI complete media containing test compound.<br>
Compound Preparation<br>
The compounds are solubilized in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The DMSO concentration should not exceed a final concentration of 1% for addition to the culture wells. The compounds are generally tested at concentrations ranging from 30-0.014 p.M.<br>
Incubation<br>
The solution of test compound is added at 60 \iM to the first well containing RPMI complete and serial 3 fold dilutions are made in the wells. The PBMC suspension is then added to the wells in an equal volume, bringing the test compound concentrations to the desired range (30-0.014 |iM). The final<br><br>
concentration of PBMC suspension is 2 x 106 cells/mL. The plates are covered with sterile plastic lids, mixed gently and then incubated for 18 to 24 hours at 37°C in a 5% carbon dioxide atmosphere.<br>
Separation<br>
Following incubation the plates are centrifuged for 10 minutes at 1000 rpm (approximately 200 x g) at 4°C. The cell-free culture supernatant is removed with a sterile polypropylene pipet and transferred to sterile polypropylene tubes. Samples are maintained at -30 to -70°C until analysis. The samples are analyzed for interferon (a) by ELISA and for tumor necrosis factor (a) by ELISA or IGEN Assay.<br>
