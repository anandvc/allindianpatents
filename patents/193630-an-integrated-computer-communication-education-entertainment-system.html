This invention relat-es to an integrated computer-communication-education-entertainment system.<br>
The system proposed herein can be used as a single utility system for viewing TV/video tape pro¬grammes, sending &amp; receiving Fax/Telephone mes¬sages, scientific and commercial data processing applications, data retrieval and sending of data &amp; software programs. This system integrates the capabilities of a commercial TV receiver, a VCR, a scientific  computer and a communication   system.<br>
A separate interface/controller board for each of the above functions can be plugged into a single mother board - INTEL 486 based system controller.<br>
Various other features of this invention will be apparent from the following further description thereof  given hereunder.<br><br>
The integrated computer-communication-education-entertainment system, according to this invention, comprises an INTEL 486 based system controller with keyboard, colour monitor and printer, the said system controller being connected to a TV/VCR interface controller; a fax-telephone interface; and a C D interface; the said TV/VCR interface controller comprising a TV tuner, a video decoder , two banks of VRAMS for odd/even fields, a memory controller, DAC with switcher, PLD, audio detector and processor; the said fax-telephone interface including circuits for PSTN interface, analog to digital conversion, digital to analog conversion, DTMF and ring detection; the said CD interface including a DSP/ISA inter¬face chip .<br>
This invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings which illustrate, by way of example, one of various possible embodiments of the system proposed here¬in, wherein<br><br>
Fig.l  illustrates  the circuitry  of  the  TV/VCR<br>
interface/controller<br>
Fig.2  illustrates the circuitry relating  to  the<br>
fax-telephone interface<br>
Fig.3 illustrates the circuitry relating to the CD<br>
interface<br>
Fig.  4 illustrates the circuitry relating to  the<br>
Intel 486 based controller and<br>
Fig.  5 illustrates the circuitry relating to  the<br>
system proposed herein<br>
TV - VCR INTERFACE/COTROLLER (Fig.l)<br>
This card captures video and overlays it on the system monitor . This board can display real time full motion video of up to 30 frames per second. The input can be any standard video input sources like TV, VCR, Camcorder and Laser Disc. The video is presented as a fully scalable window under software control.<br><br>
The card can be used to capture, cut, edit, cap¬tion, freeze, posterize, mirror image reversal, slow motion, zoom (in horizontal, vertical or both directions) etc. of the full motion video. Built-in TV tuner helps to watch live TV channels. The video can be overlaid/captured in user defined window of any size and position. It is also possi¬ble  to  get a print-out of the  video  image.<br>
TV timer program provides automatic ON/OFF timer for the screen, presetting start and stop time or automatic start-up upon ent ing windows. Programs belonging to PAL/NTSC/SECAM can be received (present card features only PAL programs). The Audio stage can provide mono/stereo audio outputs. Bass/Treble and volume can be adjusted for bright¬ness, contrast, saturation, hue, sharpness and auto channel search. A menu driven remote control unit provides all the functions of a VCR like fast forward rewind, pause etc.<br><br>
The board consists of a TV tuner, SAA7110 single chip video decoder. two banks of VRAMs for odd/even fields, a memory controller, triple DAC with switcher and audio processor. SAA7110 digi¬tizes analog baseband video signals and decodes it into colour difference information (YUV in CCIR format). The chip can also receive S-video or any other six analog video inputs. The chip can oper¬ate on PAL/NTSC/SECAM standards. The chip also provides sync. and blanking information to the memory controller.<br>
The memory controller converts the digital YUV data into 24 bit digital R,G,B, (8 bit each). The data is stored in VRAM banks. The memory controller scan converts the RGB data to the VGA timing frequencies/moclr<s . this is facilitated by the feature connector vga card which also supplies sync and pixel clock. controller can directly interface with isa bus for programming of display modes read vrams record></s>
 <br>
playback  of  live  video clips.  The  clips  also<br>
provides  I C bus control of  other  devices.  The<br>
serial  port of the VRAM is used by  the  graphics<br>
display processor for high speed display.<br>
The DAC converts the digital RGB into analog RGB and mixes with the analog RGB from VGA card under memory control. On a typical display screen we may have graphics and live video at the same time. A number of special effects like zoom, change of picture size etc. can be achieved.<br>
The audio is detected at the tuner output and is processed in the digitally controlled stereo audio processor (TDA7318). It can optionally accept four stereo inputs. The input gain can be adjusted. It provides volume control in 1.25 dB steps. It has bass and treble control. It also provides balance control between left and right channels. It has independent mute function and fader facility plus equalization for noise reduction.<br><br>
The Programmable Logic Device (PLD) provides the necessary PAL decoding coefficients and other timing signals.<br>
FAX - TELEPHONE INTERFACE (Fig.2)<br>
This card provides connectivity between Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) and the CCEE system. The fax and telephone lines are thus connected to the Intel 486 based system control¬ler . This system controller provides the overall management of the total system functions. The Fax - telephone interface card is a half size PC add on card with sufficient circuits for PSTM interface. Analog to digital conversion and digi¬tal to analog conversion, DTMF (Dual tone multiple frequency) detection, ring detection etc. Incoming calls in the DTMF mode will be detected by the processor card. To avoid spurious calls, a specified number of "DTMF' tones (rings) are fixed and thus only the genuine incoming calls/fax messages are detected. If it is a fax  message,the<br><br>
system can receive it automatically as fax message and store it in a file for further processing, if required. These fax messages can be displayed on the monitor screen and can also be printed out or re-routed to any other destination.<br>
If the incoming call is detected as a voice call,then the system will automatically switch to voice mail functions such as voice prompting, voice digitisation and storage, message retrieval etc. The advantages of the system include user friendliness, paperless operation, auto dialling etc .<br>
CD INTERFACE  (Fig.3)<br>
The functions of the CD interface card are cen¬tered around the DSP/ISA interface chip. This chip takes care of all the DSP/ISA bus interface. It provides all the interfacing and glue logic. It also provides hardware communications path for the system  audio requirement, the ISA bus  Codec  and<br><br>
the DSP. The primary interface between the system controller and sound card is through a set of registers with jumper selectable base addresses. This card can provide the basic functions of CD interface. Digital audio playback and audio compression using the DSP chip. An addition of music ROM can give FM synthesis capability to the card. Since the DSP is reprogammable, different algorithms can be down loaded to allow custom algorithms to be run on the same hardware. The sound card also provides a microphone and auxiliary input facility. The outputs of the card include auxiliary output and speaker per channel of audio. The card is stereo compatible and accepts stereo input/output and can give sampling rate of up to 48 KHz at 16 bit resolution.<br>
INTEL 486 BASED SYSTEM CONTROLLER (Fig.4)<br>
The 80486 based controller forms the core of the system proposed herein. Intel 80486 DX2 processor base  controller  board has 16 MB  dynamic  Random<br><br>
Access Memory. The chip has got on-chip 8 KB cache for data and code. In addition there is a 128 KB external cache memory also. Bus structure used by the controller will be the Industry Standard Architecture (ISA). All the necessary interface/ controllers for the proposed system will be com¬patible with ISA bus architecture.<br>
The controllers used in this will be<br>
a)	IDE (Intelligent Drive Electronics) controller for Hard disk and Floppy.<br>
b)	VGA (Video Graphics Array) controller for display.<br>
c)	PAL to VGA controller for converting signals<br>
from Cameras, VCR etc. to VGA format.<br>
d)	Speech/voice interface and CD ROM interface<br>
card .<br>
The mother board is provided with two serial ports which may be used to connect Modems. The Modems can  be  used to receive/send  fax  and  telephone<br><br>
messages. In addition, there will be a Centronix Compatible Printer Port.<br>
