				<td>Control Cabinet with Cooling Device The invention relates to a switchgear cabinet with a rack, which is put together from profiled frame sections and paneled with lateral elements and at least one cabinet door, and which encloses a switchgear cabinet interior, in which electrical installations are housed, and wherein in the area of at least one vertical side of the rack a cooling device is arranged, which removes the heat being generated in the switchgear cabinet interior.<br>
Such a switchgear cabinet is known from DE 41 11 457 C1. The rack of the switchgear cabinet is put together from twelve equal profiled frame sections.  The sides of the rack are paneled with vertical lateral elements.  The switchgear cabinet can be refurbished by means of a cooling device.  To this end, a lateral element is removed from the rack and a cooling device is screwed to the vertical profiled frame section in its place.  The cooling device encloses an interior chamber, in which the cooling units are housed.  It is possible to aspirate air from the switchgear cabinet interior into the interior chamber, to cool it there and then to return it into the switchgear cabinet interior.<br>
It is the object of the invention to create a switchgear cabinet of the type mentioned at the outset, in connection with which the refurbishing by means of an airconditioning device is possible with a small outlay of parts.<br>
This object of the invention is attained in that a separating element is fastened on the profiled frame sections and is distanced parallel in relation to the lateral element which, together with the lateral element, constitutes an air guide conduit and which is provided with several openings, which create a spatial connection of the air guide conduit with the switchgear<br>
-2-<br><br>
cabinet interior, and that it is possible to convey air through the air guide conduit and at least one opening by means of at least one ventilator.<br>
For refurbishing the switchgear cabinet, the lateral element becomes a component of the airconditioning device, so that the latter need not be exchanged.  This simple step considerably reduces the structural outlay for a cooling device.  Moreover, if the separating element is installed in the interior of the switchgear cabinet, the exterior appearance of the switchgear cabinet is not, or only negligibly, affected.<br><br>
 For a simplified assembly it can be provided that the openings cut in a vertical wall of the separating element are arranged symmetrically distributed in respect to the horizontally and/or vertically extending center transverse plane of the separating element. A preferred embodiment of the invention provides that the separating element is equipped with at least two rows of openings, which are evenly distanced from each other, and that one of the rows is arranged in the bottom area and the second row in the cover area of the interior chamber.  The heated air collected in 1 the cover area can be aspirated through the upper openings, cooled in the airconditioning device and then re-introduced into the switchgear cabinet through the openings in the bottom area.  It can also additionally be provided that at least one further row of openings is arranged in the center area between the bottom and cover areas of the switchgear cabinet interior, in order to provide in this way further introduction or removal options of air into, or respectively out of the air guide channel.<br>
In a preferred manner it is provided that the openings can be closed off independently of each other by means of covers.<br>
3<br><br>
This makes it possible for the user to use those openings of an already present airconditioning device, which in the particular case are suitable for effective cooling.  The openings which are not required are simply closed off by means of the covers.  For example, the covers can be designed as plate-like elements, which are suspended by hooks on the separating element and are secured to it with a fastening element.<br>
In order to make the air conveyance in the guide conduit possible in a simple manner, it is provided in accordance with the invention that ventilators are arranged in the area of one or several openings, which aspirate the air conveyed in the guide conduit through the opening out of the switchgear cabinet interior, or give it off into it.  In this case the ventilators are primarily arranged on the side of the separating element facing the switchgear cabinet interior.<br>
By means of this it is possible to place the separating<br>
element closely against the lateral element, so that a space-<br>
saving construction is possible.<br>
The invention will be explained in greater detail in what follows by means<br>
of an  exemplary  embodiment  represented  in  the  accompanying  drawings.<br>
Shown are in:<br>
Fig. 1, a rack of a switchgear cabinet and a separating element fastened thereon in a perspective exploded view,<br>
Fig. 2, an airconditioning device, embodied as a cooling device and fastened on the rack in a partial view, and<br>
Fig. 3, the cooling device of Fig. 2, but in a changed construction.<br>
A rack 10, which is put together from vertical and horizontal profiled frame sections 11, 12 and 13, is represented in Fig. 1.  In this case the horizontal profiled frame sections<br>
4<br><br>
12, 13 are designed as depth and width struts.  They have been put together to form a bottom and a cover frame.  The bottom and the cover frame can be connected with each other by means of the vertical profiled frame sections 11.  The vertical profiled frame sections are equipped with four profiled sides, which are oriented toward the interior of the rack 10.  These profiled sides have rows of fastening receivers 14, spaced apart at even distances from each other.  Respectively two profiled sides per vertical profiled frame section 11 are assigned to each side of the rack<br>
10,	wherein one of the profiled sides extends parallel with the associated side.  A separating element 20 can be fastened on these profiled sides of two adjoining vertical profiled frame sections<br>
11,	which extend parallel with the side of the rack 10.  The separating element 20 essentially has a vertical wall 21, which is provided with horizontal bevels on its upper and lower side. Three rows of respectively three openings 23 have been cut into the wall 21.  In this case the square openings are arranged in the upper, the lower and the center areas of the wall 21.  Two screw receptacles 24 are associated with each opening 23.  Here, the screw receptacles 24 have been cut into the wall 21 in the area of facing sides of the square openings 23.  It can be seen from Fig.<br>
1 that the separating element is designed symmetrically in respect to the horizontally and vertically extending center transverse plane of the wall 21.  Bores 22 are provided in the area of the vertical sides of the wall 21 for fastening the separating element 20.  The bores 22 can be arranged aligned with fastening receptacles 14 of the vertical profiled frame sections 11.  The separating element 20 can then be screwed to the vertical profiled frame sections 11 by means of fastening elements 15.<br>
5<br><br>
Covers 25 are used for closing one or several openings 23. The covers 25 are embodied as rectangular, plate-shaped elements. In the area of one side, the covers 25 are provided with stamped-out hooks 26.  A bore 27 has been cut into the cover 25 on the side opposite the hooks 26.  For closing off an opening, the cover 25 can be suspended in the wall 21 with its hook 26.  It is subsequently possible to introduce a fastening element 15 through the bore 27 and to screw it into the screw receptacle 24.<br>
A possible application example of the cooling device represented in Fig. 1 is shown in Fig. 2.  Here, the openings 23 of the lower and the center rows of openings 23 are closed by means of covers 25.  Only one of the openings 23 remains uncovered.  A ventilator 30 is fastened in the area of this uncovered opening 23.  The ventilator 30 is fastened on a pedestal 29, which is supported by a holder 29a.  The holder 29a also has hook elements 26, by means of which it can be suspended in the wall 21 and thereafter fixed in place in the appropriate screw receptacle 24 by means of a fastening element 15.<br>
As can be furthermore seen in Fig. 2, a lateral element 4 0 is fastened on the exterior of the rack 10.  In this case the lateral element 40 is arranged at a parallel distance in respect to the wall 21 of the separating element 20.  Because of this an air guide conduit 28 is formed between the lateral element 40 and the separating element 20.<br>
Air can be aspirated from the air guide conduit 2 8 by means of the ventilators 30 and blown into the interior of the switchgear cabinet.  The openings 23 which are arranged in the upper area of the wall 21 provide a spatial connection between the switchgear cabinet interior and the air guide conduit 28.  Thus,<br>
6<br><br>
heated air can be aspirated out of the switchgear cabinet interior through these openings 23.<br>
A further application example of the cooling device in accordance with the invention is represented in Fig. 3.  As can be seen from the representation, the openings 23 arranged at the top of the wall 21 are each equipped with a ventilator 30.  The remaining openings 23 of the separating element 20 remain uncovered.  The heated air can be aspirated by means of the ventilators in the cover area of the switchgear cabinet and blown into the air auide conduit 28.<br>
With the cooling devices in accordance with the invention, the lateral element 40 constitutes a heat exchanger, by means of which the heat energy of the aspirated air can be released to the surroundings.<br>
The air cooled in this manner then leaves the air guide conduit 28 through the unclosed openings 23 and gets back into the interior of the switchgear cabinet.<br>
