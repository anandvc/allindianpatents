[0002]	FIELD AND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003]	Field of the Invention<br>
[0004]	The present invention generally relates to devices for diverting particulate<br>
matter away from spaces around and between catalyst blocks used in selective catalytic<br>
reduction (SCR) devices to remove nitrogen oxides (NOx) from flue gases and, in<br>
particular, to particulate diverter devices for diverting powdered and/or solid particulate<br>
matter away from spaces around and between catalyst blocks used in such SCRs.<br>
[0005]	Description of the Related Art<br>
[0006]	The by-products of fossil fuel combustion include, among other things, flue<br>
gases and generally an ash component. The ash component of a fossil fuel combustion<br>
process is particularly notable in the case of coal combustion, and to a lesser extent in<br>
the combustion of oil. The combination of the ash and gaseous combustion products<br>
can, if discharged in sufficient quantity, cause significant air pollution. The ash<br>
component of such flue gases generally contain silicon dioxide, aluminum oxide, and<br><br>
ferric oxide ash particles, whereas the gaseous component of the flue gases contain, at<br>
a minimum, carbon dioxide, sulfur oxides (SOx), and nitrogen oxides (NOx).<br>
[0007]	A variety of methods and/or devices are used to remove, for example,<br>
particulates, sulfur oxides (SOx) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). The problems of particulate<br>
or ash removal and disposal from flue gases can be significant in the case of the<br>
combustion of coal, since about 80% to about 90% of the ash generated by coal<br>
combustion processes remains in the flue gases. Current energy policy in the United<br>
States is based on expanded use of coal in utility and industrial applications. Such<br>
expanded use of coal can not lead to a compromise in environmental requirements for<br>
clean air. Accordingly, advanced control technologies are needed to control the<br>
increase in pollutant emissions of coal combustion.<br>
[0008]	Electrostatic precipitators and other particulate collection devices such as<br>
fabric filter houses (baghouses) have been used to effectively remove such particulates<br>
from flue gases prior to atmospheric release. United States Patent No. 4,309,386<br>
discloses a hot catalytic baghouse which simultaneously removes particulate material<br>
and reduces the NOx emissions. This patent describes coating the catalyst onto the<br>
fabric of the baghouse filter media including the use of a fabric filter in which the catalyst<br>
is woven into the fabric. United States Patent No. 4,793,981 describes the use of a hot<br>
catalytic baghouse which simultaneously collects sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides and<br>
particulates.<br>
[0009]	United States Patent No. 4,602,673 discloses an apparatus for pre-<br>
heating combustion air while simultaneously reducing NOx contained in the flue gas. By<br>
combining a catalytic reactor with an air heater, a compact device is possible according<br>
to that patent. However, the catalyst will have to be replaced frequently because of<br>
erosion of the catalyst due to ash and/or dust build-up. In addition, fly ash erosion will<br>
reduce the effective life of an SCR catalyst.<br><br>
[0010]	SCRs using catalyst blocks are often used in applications where NOx<br>
removal from flue gases is needed. In such cases, the SCR catalyst blocks are placed<br>
within the SCR reactor through which the combustion flue gases are conveyed. In order<br>
to remain effective, the catalyst should be protected from accumulation of particulate<br>
contaminants, which may deposit on the catalyst or otherwise restrict gas flow to and/or<br>
through the catalyst. One particular area of concern is the gaps or spaces between<br>
individual catalyst blocks. If particulate accumulates in a manner that fills these gaps<br>
and bridges the spaces between catalyst blocks, flue gas flow to the surface area of the<br>
catalyst is limited, thereby degrading the SCR's relative effectiveness for NOx removal.<br>
[0011]	This problem has, to date, been addressed by installing thin strips of metal<br>
called ash shields (also known as "wall seals", "catalyst block seals", or "layer caps")<br>
around catalyst blocks. The size, location and other design parameters of the strips are<br>
chosen so that ash remains entrained in the flue gas and does not settle on the one or<br>
more catalyst blocks. In general, ash shields are installed by tack welding metal strips<br>
to one or more appropriate locations of the catalyst block support frame. Alternatively,<br>
or in addition to, ash shields can be tack welded to the SCR casing, both activities being<br>
performed after the catalyst blocks are in place. Such ash shields are inconvenient<br>
because they are welded into place, prevent screen removal, and need to be removed<br>
prior to cleaning and/or replacing the one or more catalyst blocks as screen removal is<br>
generally necessary for access the catalyst blocks.<br>
[0012]	An additional prior practice has been to overlap such ash shields with the<br>
catalyst block support frame. However, this is also not desirable because the catalyst<br>
blocks need to be cleaned and/or replaced periodically. Catalyst cleaning can be<br>
accomplished only if a screen is removed from the top of the catalyst. The screen<br>
generally cannot be removed until the ash shield is destructively removed.<br><br>
[0013]	in addition to the foregoing, prior art ash shield designs are also subject to<br>
installation and operational damage. Welding such ash shields with the catalyst in<br>
place also exposes the sensitive catalyst surface to the risk of weld splatter, which can<br>
cause catalyst damage and/or degradation.<br>
[0014]	Given the above, a need exists in the art for devices and methods of<br>
diverting particulate contaminants in an SCR without the use of welded ash shields.<br>
[0015]	SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0016]	The present invention generally relates to an apparatus for diverting<br>
contaminant matter into catalyst blocks used in selective catalytic reduction (SCR)<br>
devices to remove nitrogen oxides (NOx) from flue gases and, in particular, to<br>

[0028]	DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0029]	Referring to the drawings generally, wherein like reference numerals<br>
designate the same or functionally similar elements throughout the several drawings,<br>
and to Fig. 1 in particular, there is shown a first embodiment of a particulate diverter<br>
device, alternatively a catalyst particulate diverter (CPD) (when used in conjunction with<br>
catalyst blocks) according to the present invention, and generally designated 100. The<br>
primary function of the CPD 100 is to divert powdered or solid contaminants such as<br>
flyash away from spaces around and between catalyst blocks used in SCRs. One or<br>
more CPDs 100 designed to divert particulate matter into the one or more catalyst<br>
blocks present in, for example, a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) enclosure, would<br>
be typically employed. While not wishing to be bound to any one set of advantages, the<br>
CPDs 100 of the present invention permit reduced installation time, labor and expense<br>
while providing a means for diverting particulate matter away from spaces around and<br>
between a catalyst block 120 and the casing of an SCR enclosure. In another<br>
embodiment, the CPDs 100 of the present invention provide a means for diverting<br>
particulate matter away from spaces around and between adjacent catalyst blocks 120<br>
within an SCR enclosure. In one embodiment, the CPDs of the present invention are<br>
installed at the same time the SCR enclosure is filled with catalyst blocks. In another<br>
embodiment, previously filled SCR enclosures can be retrofitted with CPDs according to<br>
the present invention so as to potentially lengthen the service life of the catalyst blocks<br>
contained therein.<br><br>
[0030]	In use, the CPDs of the present invention entail different embodiments<br>
designed to fit and/or seal different portions of the SCR enclosure and the catalyst<br>
blocks, or adjacent catalyst blocks. In one embodiment, a CPD according to the<br>
present invention is designed to create a seal, or particulate diverting means, between a<br>
catalyst block located next to an interior surface of the SCR enclosure. This<br>
embodiment is detailed in Fig. 1.<br>
[0031]	As shown in Fig. 1, a first embodiment of a CPD 100 comprises a wall-<br>
contacting portion 102, a tensioning portion 104, a lip 106, and an L-shaped anchor<br>
108. Lip 106 is integrally connected to CPD 100 in any suitable position so as to<br>
operatively engage a catalyst block holding tray or catalyst support means of an SCR<br>
enclosure. As is shown in Fig. 1 CPD 100 is located between an exterior wall 110 and a<br>
catalyst block holding tray 112. In operation, CPD 100 operatively engages the interior<br>
surface of, for example, external wall 110 via wall-contacting portion 102, a tensioning<br>
portion 104 and L-shaped anchor 108/116. CPD 100 is maintained in place via the<br>
operative engagement of lip 106 with catalyst block holding tray 112. Tension is<br>
generated by CPD 100 due to the fact the resting arc X of CPD 100 is smaller than arc<br>
X when CPD 100 is placed between wall 110 and catalyst block holding tray 112.<br>
[0032]	In one embodiment, resting are X has an angle of about 95 to about 170<br>
degrees, or from about 100 to about 150 degrees, or even from about 110 to about 145<br>
degrees.<br>
[0033]	The leg portion 116 of L-shaped anchors 108/116 allows the catalyst<br>
blocks to be pre positioned, improving ease of catalytic block installation and reducing<br>
maintenance outage times. The L-shaped anchors 108/116 and wall contacting portion<br>
102 may also be altered to fit over any obstructions such as, but not limited to, soot<br>
blowers and sonic horns for example. Optionally, a gasket material may be placed<br><br>
between the L-shaped anchor 108/116 and the catalyst block holding tray to reduce the<br>
rate of particulate matter leakage past the CPD 100.<br>
[0034]	CPD 100 is generally assembled from one or more pieces of metal via any<br>
suitable assembly process (welding, brazing, riveting, adhesive, etc.) to yield a desired<br>
shape that can be tension mounted, as noted above, in an SCR enclosure. In one<br>
embodiment, CPD 100 is formed from a single sheet of metal that is suitably bent to<br>
yield CPD 100. In another embodiment, CPD 100 can be formed from a single sheet of<br>
metal that is suitably bent to yield all the elements of CPD 100 except for lip 106. In this<br>
embodiment, lip 106 can be formed from, for example, a suitably shaped metal bar that<br>
is attached via any suitable means (e.g., welded) to CPD 100.<br>
[0035]	In one embodiment, CPD 100 is formed from any suitable metal including,<br>
but not limited to, steel, stainless steel, aluminum, titanium, copper, nickel, or alloys that<br>
containing one or more of the above listed metals.<br>
[0036]	Regarding lip 106, although lip 106 is depicted as a flat piece of material,<br>
lip 106 is not limited thereto. Instead lip 106 can be any shape (e.g., a rectangular or<br>
square bar) that permits operative engagement between lip 106 and, for example,<br>
catalyst block holding tray 112 so as to ensure the proper long term placement of CPD<br>
100. Given the placement of CPD 100, particulate matter is not permitted, or able, to<br>
pass between the interior surface of wall 110 and catalyst block holding tray 112. In<br>
Fig. 1, catalyst block hold tray holds an SCR catalyst block 120.<br>
[0037]	In an alternative embodiment, the tension portion 104 may be comprised<br>
of one or more elements. Fig. 1A illustrates such and alternative embodiment of a<br>
catalytic particulate diverter 130 wherein tension portion comprises two elements,<br>
horizontal tensions element 114 and angled tension element 109. As would be<br>
appreciated by one of skill in the art, multiple additional tensions element combination<br>
are possible without deviating from the teachings and scope of the present invention.<br><br>
[0038]	In another embodiment, a CPD according to the present invention is<br>
designed to create a seal, or particulate diverting means, between at least two adjacent<br>
catalyst blocks, where such blocks are located on different support means (e.g., catalyst<br>
block holding trays 112). An example of such an embodiment is detailed in Fig. 2.<br>
[0039]	Turning to Fig. 2, a second embodiment of a CPD 200 comprises two<br>
anchoring portions 202 and 204 that are attached at opposite ends of a V-shaped<br>
tensioning portion 206, and two lips 208 and 210 located at the respective interfaces<br>
between V-shaped tensioning portion 206 and anchoring portions 202 and 204. Lips<br>
208 and 210 are integrally connected to CPD 200 in any suitable position so as to<br>
operatively engage a catalyst block 120 in order to maintain the position of CPD 200<br>
between two adjacent catalyst blocks 120. In operation, CPD 200 operatively engages<br>
adjacent surfaces of two adjacent catalyst blocks 120 via anchoring portions 202 and<br>
204, and the tension generated by V-shaped tensioning portion 206.<br>
[0040]	Tension is generated by CPD 200 due to the fact the resting arc A of CPD<br>
200 is greater than arc A when CPD 200 is placed between adjacent catalyst blocks<br>
120. In other words, uninstalled CPD 200 has a greater distance "d" between anchoring<br>
portions 202 and 204 than installed CPD 200. In one embodiment, resting arc A has an<br>
angle of about 75 to about 150 degrees, or from about 100 to about 130 degrees, or<br>
even from about 110 to about 125 degrees.<br>
[0041]	In an alternative embodiment, a gasket material may be placed between<br>
the anchor portion 202 and catalyst block 120, or between anchor portion 204 and<br>
catalyst block 120 to reduce the rate of particulate matter leakage past the CPD 200.<br>
[0042]	CPD 200 is generally assembled from one or more pieces of metal via any<br>
suitable assembly process (welding, brazing, riveting, adhesive, etc.) to yield a desired<br>
shape that can be tension mounted, as noted above, between two adjacent catalyst<br><br>
blocks in, for example, an SCR enclosure. In one embodiment, CPD 200 is formed<br>
from a single sheet of metal that is suitably bent to yield CPD 200. In another<br>
embodiment, CPD 200 can be formed from a single sheet of metal that is suitably bent<br>
to yield all the elements of CPD 200 except for lips 208 and 210. In this embodiment,<br>
lips 208 and 210 can be formed from, for example, a suitably shaped metal rod that is<br>
attached via any suitable means (e.g., welded) to CPD 200.<br>
[0043]	In one embodiment, CPD 200 is formed from any suitable metal including,<br>
but not limited to, steel, stainless steel, aluminum, titanium, copper, nickel, or alloys that<br>
contain one or more of the above listed metals.<br>
[0044]	Regarding lips 208 and 210, although lips 208 and 210 are depicted as a<br>
flat piece of material, lips 208 and 210 are not limited thereto. Instead lips 208 and 210<br>
can be any shape that permits operative engagement between lips 208 and 210 and, for<br>
example, catalyst blocks 120 so as to ensure the proper long term placement of CPD<br>
200. Given the placement of CPD 200, the ability for particulate matter to pass between<br>
adjacent catalyst blocks 120 is restricted.<br>
[0045]	In still another embodiment, a CPD according to the present invention is<br>
designed to create a seal, or particulate diverting means, between at least two adjacent<br>
catalyst blocks, where such blocks are located on the same support means (e.g.,<br>
catalyst block holding tray 112). This embodiment is detailed in Fig. 3.<br>
[0046]	Turning to Fig. 3, an alternative embodiment of a CPD 300 comprising<br>
anchoring portion 304 is centrally attached to flat bar 370 forming a T-shape. Flat bar<br>
portion has a first end 371 a second end 372, the first end 371 and second end 372 of<br>
the flat bar portion 370 maintaining contact with at least one surface of adjacent<br>
catalysts blocks 120, anchor portion 304 comprising of at least two sides being<br>
operatively joined to the flat bar portion 307 between the first end 371 and second end<br>
372, wherein opposite sides of the anchoring portion are maintained in close proximity<br><br>
or contact with at least one surface of adjacent catalyst blocks 120. Width of anchor<br>
304 is selected to optimally space adjacent catalytic blocks at a predetermined distance<br>
apart from on another. In operation, CPD 300 operatively diverts particulate matter<br>
away from the spaces between adjacent catalyst blocks.<br>
[0047]	In an alternative embodiment, Fig 4., T-shaped portion may contain<br>
additional tabs or legs 471, 472 extending downward from first and second ends 371,<br>
372 of flat bar portion 370.<br>
[0048]	In yet another alternative embodiment, Fig 5., first and second ends 371,<br>
372, may be position at an angle of less than 90 degrees relative flat bar portion 370.<br>
[0049]	CPD 300 is generally assembled from one or more pieces of metal via any<br>
suitable assembly process (welding, brazing, riveting, adhesive, etc.) to yield a desired<br>
shape that can be tension mounted, as noted above, between two adjacent catalyst<br>
blocks in, for example, an SCR enclosure. In one embodiment, CPD 300 is formed<br>
from a single sheet of metal that is suitably bent to yield CPD 300. In another<br>
embodiment, CPD 300 can be formed from a single sheet of metal that is suitably bent<br>
to yield all the elements of CPD 300.<br>
[0050]	In one embodiment, CPD 300 is formed from any suitable metal including,<br>
but not limited to, steel, stainless steel, aluminum, titanium, copper, nickel, or alloys that<br>
containing one or more of the above listed metals.<br>
[0051]	It will thus be appreciated that the CPDs of the present invention provide<br>
numerous advantages:<br>
allows screen removal without destroying the gas diverter;<br>
allows catalyst block removal without destroying the gas diverter;<br>
significantly reduces initial installation time, labor and expense;<br>
significantly reduces subsequent outage time, labor and expense;<br><br>
provides an ash seal between the catalyst and the casing and/or between<br>
catalyst blocks;<br>
minimizes field welding while promoting push-in-place and drop-in-place<br>
installation;<br>
re-usable;<br>
minimal in field trimming; pieces are sized per application and not supplied in<br>
bulk strip lengths;<br>
spring action design of several embodiments of the CPDs easily establishes the<br>
initial seal and maintains it throughout operating and maintenance conditions;<br>
drop-in design of another embodiment allows it to be cut to length; no field<br>
trimming from longer bulk lengths;<br>
self-adjusting sizing; no re-bending to adjust for block position inaccuracies;<br>
reduced installation time resulting in reduced electric utility outage time;<br>
-weld spatter risk is reduced because the limited welding requirement is<br>
performed before the catalyst is present; and<br>
weld removal risk is reduced because flame cutting or grinding is not required to<br>
remove the strips.<br>
[0052]	The spring loaded embodiment of Fig. 1 bridges the gap between the<br>
catalyst blocks and adjacent casing; they are installed before the catalyst blocks are<br>
loaded into the SCR and maintain good contact with the catalyst blocks. The<br>
embodiment of Fig. 2 is installed in the wide gap between catalyst blocks, while the<br>
embodiment of Fig. 3 is installed in the narrow gap; both can be installed after the entire<br>
array of blocks are all in place or while the array is being placed. The latter two<br>
embodiments are pre-engineered to length for fast and easy drop-in installation, and<br>
minor dimensional changes will permit the CPDs to be adapted to any vendor's catalyst<br>
block design.<br>
[0053]	While specific embodiments of the present invention have been shown<br>
and described in detail to illustrate the application and principles of the invention, it will<br><br>
be understood that it is not intended that the present invention be limited thereto and<br>
that the invention may be embodied otherwise without departing from such principles.<br>
For example, V-shaped tensioning portion 206 could be replaced by a tensioning<br>
portion having an alternative shape, such as a U-shaped tensioning portion. Thus,<br>
while the present invention has been described above with reference to particular<br>
means, materials, and embodiments, it is to be understood that this invention may be<br>
varied in many ways without departing from the spirit and scope thereof, and therefore<br>
is not limited to these disclosed particulars but extends instead to all equivalents within<br>
the scope of the following claims.<br><br>
