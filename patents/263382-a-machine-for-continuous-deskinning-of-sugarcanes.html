				<td>The present invention relates to a continuous machine for deskinning of sugarcanes and other similar plant products.<br>
India is world's leader in sugarcane production but uses age-old traditional processing technology. Our country holds first position in the production of sugarcanes followed by Brazil. Frequent occurrence of drastic fluctuations in sugar production is a cause of concern for its effective utilization. Mini sugar plants (Khandsari units) have received little attention for technology upgradation. They can function as efficient supplementary production facilities with the application of modern methods of sugarcane processing. But, the major problem is the fermented smell that develops during storage, which is mainly due to waxes present on the skin.<br>
With the ever increasing demand for soft beverages and fruit based beverages, both carbonated and still, are available in the market. India offers itself a potential market for these products. All the sugarcanes produced in the country are not lifted by the sugar mills, leaving almost one third for use in the production of gur (Jaggery; and khandsari. This necessitates finding ways and means of using sugarcane for other purposes. In this context, Central Food Technological Research Institute has made significant contributions in the field of sugarcane juice by undertaking front-line R&amp;D work. CFTRI has developed processes for the<br><br>
preservation of sugarcane juice beverage in bottle, standi pouches, aluminium cans and also as powders. The beverage, being natural possesses a lot of medicinal and curative properties in the treatment of several ailments. The beverage is calorific and nutritive with bio-active compounds.<br>
The critical step of the process is removal of the skin, which will eliminate jaggery flavour during storage and avoid settling of particles. Moreover the non-sugar impurities like gums, waxes, pectins, etc. are found mainly on the external surface of the cane crushed for juice extraction. Consequently, juice quality is poor and its clarification is a complex and costlier process, as expensive centrifuges have to be used, which add to the processing cost.<br>
Also, lot of chemicals is used in the preparation of jaggery to bleach the colour and to obtain a golden brown colour. This is harmful as sometimes, they may lead to allergies in the consumer. Hence, it is always preferred to use jaggery with lower levels of chemicals or better no chemicals used. However, this is not possible as the jaggery industry uses juice extracted from canes without deskinning. This may be due to the fact that it involves a lot of labour to remove the skin and using chemicals to bleach is a easy way out.<br>
By deskinning, external impurities are eliminated along with the rind.<br><br>
Consequently, juice quality is far superior. This will also reduce the chemical load in the jaggery industry. Also the extraction efficiency is at par with the multitendum mills, hence competitive and cost effective. These facts indicate the importance of deskinning the canes.<br>
Present status of Technology<br>
The canes are being deskinned manually by employing number of labourers using a heavy SS knife. However, this method of deskinning is highly labour intensive and tedious. Hence, a continuous machine for deskinning of sugarcane has been developed.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a machine for<br>
deskinning of sugarcanes.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a continuous<br>
machine for deskinning of sugarcanes.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to reduce manual drudgery.<br>
Yet another object is to increase productivity compared to manual<br>
deskinning.<br>
Still another object is to provide a machine capable of working with a<br>
wide range of sizes (diameter) of canes.<br>
In the drawing accompanying this specification, figure land figure 2<br>
represents the complete machine and the cutter for sugarcane<br>
deskinning.<br><br>
Accordingly the present invention provides the development of a device for sugarcane deskinning, which comprises of a complete machine as shown in figures 1-4.<br>

invention and therefore not to be construed to limit the scope of the<br>
