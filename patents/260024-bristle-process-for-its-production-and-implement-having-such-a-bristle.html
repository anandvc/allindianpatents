				<td>BRISTLE, PROCESS FOR ITS PRODUCTION AND IMPLEMENT HAVING SUCH A BRISTLE<br>
The invention relates to a bristle comprising a core of a comparatively<br>
rigid, bending-elastic plastic and at least one layer of a rubberlike plas-<br>
tic. The invention also relates to a process for the production of such<br>
bristles and to implements equipped with such bristles.<br>
Independently of the intended use of a brush, certain fundamental demands<br>
are made on the bristles. These more particularly include the bending<br>
elasticity, flexural strength and resistance to wear. Further and often<br>
very differing requirements result from the intended use of the brush.<br>
Thus, e.g. brushes for oral and body hygiene must be sufficiently soft to<br>
avoid injury, whereas abrasively acting, industrial brushes must have hard<br>
and rough bristles. Other technical brushes, such as car wash brushes, must<br>
once again be smooth and pliable. This also applies in the case of polish-<br>
ing brushes. Brushes or paintbrushes used for the application of media,<br>
must have relatively closely juxtaposed, standing bristles for storing the<br>
medium, whereas in other applications individual standing bristles or<br>
bristle bundles are desired.<br>
The action of a bristle on the surface of the object to be treated or<br>
worked is decisively dependent on the surface characteristics thereof and<br>
the bristle material. Generally bristles are produced from extruded plastic<br>
monofilaments. As a result of the choice of the plastic it is essentially<br>
only possible to influence the bending and wear resistance, but only to a<br>
very limited extent the surface characteristics and the effectiveness of the<br>
surface, apart from simple longitudinal profiles. Thus, numerous attempts<br>
have been made in the prior art to modify the surface characteristics or the<br>
effectiveness of the surface of bristles by additional measures in order to<br>
better meet the requirements of each intended use.<br>
In the literature reference list following the description, documents (1)<br>
to (8) describe bristles with incorporated, abrasively acting particles for<br>
different uses. It is in each case a question of giving the bristle a hard,<br>
abrading action.<br>
Another development referred to in documents (9) to (15) is to profile in<br>
different ways the jacket of a bristle formed from a plastic monofilament.<br>
It is in each case a question of forming more or less sharp edges and this<br>
extends to frayed structures.<br>
All the aforementioned solutions with particle-filled or profiled, mono-<br>
filament bristles suffer from the decisive disadvantage that the strength<br>
characteristics, particularly the bending elasticity, flexural strength and<br>
also the resistance to wear are significantly reduced, so that use must<br>
once again be made of larger bristle diameters and/or higher quality plas-<br>
tics. However, this is often impossible for use reasons and also leads to<br>
undesired higher costs.<br>
Other known proposals according to documents (16) to (21) aim at producing<br>
the bristle from two plastic components, namely a plastic core and a coating<br>
applied thereto either in the form of a jacket enveloping the core or in the<br>
form of fibres applied to the core. In these known solutions the strength<br>
characteristics of the bristle remain substantially controlled. To the<br>
extent that the core has a smooth-walled jacket (16), (17), the bristle<br>
action can only be insignificantly modified. If only the hard core is<br>
profiled and a profile-following, rubber-elastic coating is applied (18),<br>
the latter is rapidly worn away at the profile humps and the hard core is<br>
exposed. To the extent that the core is flocked with fibres (20), the<br>
bristle can only be used for specific purposes and is also complicated and<br>
expensive to manufacture.<br>
Among the last-mentioned proposals, document (21) proposes a bristle com-<br>
prising an extruded, relatively stiff core of PA (polyamide) or high density<br>
PE (polyethylene) and a soft, thermoplastic coating of natural or artificial<br>
rubber. This known bristle is designed for toothbrushes, where the soft,<br>
rubber-elastic coating is mainly intended to ensure a careful treatment of<br>
the teeth and gums, whilst the stiff core ensures the necessary strength<br>
characteristics for the bristle. However, such a bristle does not satisfy<br>
the demands made during cleaning, because its surface is too smooth. It is<br>
also unsuitable for applying media to an object.<br>
On the basis of this prior art, the problem of the invention is to provide a<br>
bristle which, whilst maintaining the necessary strength characteristics in<br>
the case of a soft surface also provides a good cleaning action and absorp-<br>
tivity for media.<br>
On the basis of a bristle comprising a core of a comparatively rigid,<br>
bending-elastic plastic and at least one layer of a rubberlike plastic, the<br>
invention solves this problem in that the rubberlike layer is profiled by<br>
stamping against the core, preferably by hot stamping.<br>
The invention is based on the surprising finding that a rubber-like plastic,<br>
e.g. a thermoplastic elastomer, even with a very limited thickness, which<br>
necessarily arises in the case of bristles and with toothbrushes is only a<br>
few tenths of a millimetre, can be profiled by stamping or embossing, with-<br>
out there being any shape recovery of the rubberlike plastic. A decisive<br>
part is played by the relatively rigid core against which the stamping or<br>
embossing forces can be applied. It is possible to implement fine to coarse<br>
structures with any random shaping. Small profile depths are in particular<br>
chosen in the case of bristles for oral and body hygiene, whereas greater<br>
profile depths are used for cleaning or coating brushes for in the first<br>
case receiving dirt and in the second application media.<br>
The rubberlike layer can surround the core in jacket-like manner or also<br>
only zonally and the profiling resulting from stamping can be provided over<br>
the entire length of the bristle or only over partial lengths thereof.<br>
In the case of the bristle constructed according to the invention the core<br>
is made from a plastics material defining the bending and flexural strength<br>
of the bristle and the rubberlike layer with its profiling from a plastics<br>
material defining the surface action of the bristle on the object and the<br>
resistance to wear. Through the choice of the two plastics and the nature<br>
of the profiling, the bristle can be readily adapted to random requirements.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the core is made from a plastics material having a<br>
Shore hardness D&gt;45 and the rubberlike layer from a plastics material with a<br>
Shore hardness D
ness of the core plastic is D&gt;65 and that of the rubberlike layer 20<d></d>
Materials fulfilling the aforementioned requirements are e.g. in the case<br>
of the core PE (polyethylene), PP (polypropylene) or PA (polyamide) and for<br>
the rubberlike layer thermoplastic elastomers.<br>
The profiling of the rubberlike layer can be formed by locally defined<br>
depressions distributed over the circumference. Instead of this the pro-<br>
filing can also run in the bristle extension direction, e.g. along gener-<br>
atrixes or in helical manner. Finally, the profiling can also be prepon-<br>
derantly oriented transversely to the bristle extension direction.<br>
According to a further feature of the invention, to the profiled, rubberlike<br>
layer is applied a film-like coating of a soft plastic clinging to its<br>
profile. As a result a certain smoothing effect can be obtained on the<br>
profiling without removing the surface action therefrom.<br>
The core can be formed from one or more monofilaments. The first-mentioned<br>
form is recommended for toothbrushes and body brushes, whereas the second is<br>
better for industrial brushes and in particular car wash brushes. In this<br>
particular application the bristles must be bending-soft, so as to be<br>
applied in optimum manner to the contour of the surface to be cleaned and<br>
also so as to carefully clean the surface. These bristles are subject to<br>
very rapid wear from the free end. This means in the case of the bristle<br>
according to the invention, that the rubberlike layer is firstly worn away<br>
at the bristle ends. In the variant according to the invention with several<br>
core monofilaments they are exposed in the from of fibres, which then still<br>
ensure a careful action compared with a single, larger diameter core mono-<br>
filament.<br>
Normally bristles have a circular cross-section. However, in the case of<br>
the construction according to the invention it is possible to implement any<br>
other bristle cross-section, in that the core has a cross-section diverging<br>
from the circular shape, e.g. a narrow, rectangular or cruciform or stellate<br>
cross-section. The rubberlike layer can then have a circular cross-section,<br>
so that it has a different thickness and can e.g. be more deeply stamped<br>
in the thicker areas. Instead of this it can also have a cross-section<br>
following the core cross-section, so that independently of the location of<br>
the stamping equal-depth profiles can be produced and here again the core<br>
serves as an abutment.<br>
Finally, the entire bristle constituted by the core and rubberlike layer can<br>
be corrugated transversely to the bristle extension direction.<br>
A good adhesion of the rubberlike layer to the core is obtained through a<br>
surface structure on the core acting as a primer.<br>
For the manufacture of the above-described bristle, the invention proposes<br>
a process in which the core and the rubberlike layer are coextruded as a<br>
strand and the rubberlike layer, with the strand moving, is profiled by<br>
stamping against the core.<br>
This process leads to a continuous bristle material, from which the bristles<br>
can be cut, as desired, to length immediately after stamping. Instead of<br>
this the bristle material can be wound and then the bristle is cut to length,<br>
as desired, from the unwound strand at the time of brush manufacture.<br>
In another variant of the process, the core and the rubberlike layer are<br>
coextruded as a continuous strand, the strand is wound and the rubberlike<br>
layer is profiled by stamping against the core on unwinding the strand. In<br>
this process stamping can take place at the bristle material manufacturer or<br>
only at the brush manufacturer. This process can also be advantageous if<br>
the rubberlike layer is constituted by a slowly crosslinking elastomer and<br>
the stamping process is only to take place at the end of the crosslinking<br>
reaction.<br>
In this process the rubberlike layer is preferably profiled by stamping<br>
tools acting against one another and against the core and said tools can<br>
produce different profiles. In the case of an only one-sided profiling the<br>
stamping tool cooperates with an unprofiled counter-tool.<br>
In a further variant of the process according to the invention, to the<br>
profiled strand at the time of bristle material manufacture or prior to the<br>
cutting to length of the bristles, a soft plastic can be applied in film-<br>
like manner by extrusion, dipping, spraying or the shrinking on of a film,<br>
e.g. in order to smooth the profile.<br>
In another variant of the process, the core and the rubberlike layer are<br>
coextruded as a strand, the bristle is then cut to length from the strand<br>
and then the rubberlike layer is profiled by stamping against the core.<br>
In this process the film-like coating can be applied before or after cutting<br>
to length by dipping, spraying, or shrinking on a film.<br>
The inventively constructed bristle is usable for implements of the most<br>
varied types. In the simplest case such a bristle can be directly used as<br>
an interdental cleaner, either in the form of a stick or in a similar manner<br>
to dental floss.<br>
As opposed to this, a brush is provided with a plurality of bristles con-<br>
structed according to the invention and said bristles can be provided in<br>
separate arrangements. In particular, such a brush can have bristles with<br>
differently profiled, rubberlike layers.<br>
The invention is described in greater detail hereinafter relative to embodi-<br>
ments diagrammatically represented in the attached drawings and which in<br>
each case perspectively show in cross-section a bristle.<br>
The bristle 1 according to fig. 1 has a core 2 of a bending-elastic, flex-<br>
resistant plastic, e.g. PA, PP or PE and a rubberlike layer 3 surrounding in<br>
jacket-like manner the core 2, e.g. of a thermoplastic elastomer. In the<br>
rubberlike layer 3 is stamped a profile 4 in the form of locally defined,<br>
circumferentially distributed depressions 5. Stamping takes place against<br>
the rigid core 2.<br>
In the embodiment according to fig. 2 the bristle 1 is only stamped with the<br>
profile shown in fig. 1 over part of its length, whereas it is unprofiled<br>
over the remaining length 6, which e.g. includes the fastening-side end of<br>
the bristle. It otherwise once again comprises a core 2 of a rigid plastic,<br>
the rubberlike layer 3 with the stamped in depressions and a film-like<br>
coating 7, which covers the profiling and clings to the latter, but leads<br>
to a certain smoothing effect. In the embodiment of fig. 3 the bristle once<br>
again comprises a core 2 and a rubberlike layer 3, which is only zonally applied and runs<br>
on the core 2 in the form of longitudinal ribs, which are profiled by transverse stamping,<br>
so as to obtain depressions 8 and boss-like humps 9. In the embodiment according to<br>
fig. 4 the rubberlike layer 3 is longitudinally profiled on the core 2 and the profile can be<br>
produced by stamping after a co-extrusion operation. In addition, the rubberlike layer 3<br>
can have depressions produced by stamping as in tigs. 1 and 2 or transverse stampings<br>
as in fig. 3.<br>
Whereas in the embodiments according to figs. 1 to 4 at least the core has a circular<br>
cross-section, fig. 5 shows a bristle with a core 2 having a cruciform cross-section 10,<br>
whilst the rubberlike layer 3 has a circular cross-section. Thus, it is thinnest in the region<br>
of the ends of the beam of the cruciform cross-section 10. This leads to sharply defined<br>
abutments against which the profile can be particularly well stamped, as indicated by the<br>
arrows 11.<br>
in the embodiment according to fig. 6 the bristle 1 once again has a core 2 with a circular<br>
cross-section. The rubberlike layer 3 enveloping it is stamped with a wavy profile 12.<br>
Fig. 7 shows an embodiment modified compared with fig. 1, in that the core 2 comprises<br>
four monofilaments 13, which can be positioned parallel or twisted. The rubberlike layer<br>
3 once again surrounds the core with a circular cross-section and has on its jacket the<br>
stamped in profiling.<br>
In the embodiment according to fig. 8 the core 2 has an elongated cross-section. The<br>
rubberlike layer 3 has a constant thickness, so that it follows the cross-section of the<br>
core 2 and a strip-like bristle is obtained, which is e.g. only provided on its narrow sides<br>
with a stamped profile 4, much as in fig. 3.<br>
The bristle according to fig. 9 once again has a core 2 and a rubberlike layer 3 with a<br>
profiling 4 resulting from stamping. As a variant compared with the previously described<br>
bristles, the bristle 14 according to fig. 9 is corrugated transversely to the longitudinal<br>
extension.<br>
