				<td>Machine tool for processing tooth formations of workpieces<br>
The invention relates to a machine tool for processing tooth<br>
formations of workpieces which comprises a rotary holder<br>
which can be rotated about a main axis A, two workpiece<br>
spindles which are arranged on the rotary holder and a tool<br>
holder for a tool for processing a workpiece on one of the<br>
tool spindles. The workpiece spindles have spindle axes<br>
which are orientated parallel with the main axis A of the<br>
rotary holder and the tool spindles are arranged in<br>
particular symmetrically about the main axis A.<br>
A machine tool of the "Maschine RZ 150" type from the<br>
company "Reishauer AG" is a known example of such a machine<br>
tool.<br>
Machine tools of this type are used to process workpieces in<br>
machining production methods, in which shapes are formed in<br>
workpieces by removing chips. During the processing of tooth<br>
formations, a gear wheel is produced by machining regularly<br>
spaced tooth spaces in an outer surface of a workpiece to be<br>
processed. The production costs per workpiece and the<br>
efficiency of a machine tool are dependent on the surface<br>
performance, that is to say, the surface of a workpiece<br>
machined within a period of time, and the ratio between the<br>
production time and the non-production time. In this<br>
instance, the production time is the processing time per<br>
workpiece and the non-production time is the time taken to<br>
change workpieces.<br>
The arrangement of the two workpiece spindles on the rotary<br>
holder serves to save non-production time in that the<br>
processing of a workpiece on one of the workpiece spindles<br>
is carried out in a processing position and the loading and<br><br>
unloading of a workpiece in/from the other workpiece spindle<br>
is carried out in a transfer position at the same time,<br>
whereby the total processing cycle and the cycle time are<br>
reduced. The two workpiece spindles change their positions<br>
by the rotary holder being rotated. A workpiece spindle is<br>
rotated or pivoted into a processing position and the other<br>
workpiece spindle is moved out of the processing position.<br>
Unbalanced movements of the workpiece spindles during<br>
position change are minimised by the workpiece spindles<br>
being arranged symmetrically with respect to the main axis<br>
A.<br>
In the machine tool of Reishauer AG known from the prior art<br>
(see above), the main axis A and the spindle axes of the<br>
workpiece spindles arranged on the rotary holder are<br>
orientated in a vertical direction. In this arrangement, the<br>
chips which are removed during the processing of tooth<br>
formations of a workpiece fall onto the workpiece spindle<br>
therebelow and the rotary holder and, at that location, form<br>
clusters of chips which subsequently have to be removed in<br>
order to prevent contaminations and associated restrictions<br>
of the operation of the rotary holder and the spindle<br>
operations and the drives thereof. The known machine tool is<br>
further not well-suited to techniques for forming teeth<br>
which are distinguished by a feed movement of the tool<br>
extending parallel with the workpiece axis or the spindle<br>
axes, such as, for example, longitudinal or axial milling.<br>
In the known machine tool, such a parallel feed movement<br>
which is orientated parallel with the main axis A and<br>
consequently vertically, similarly to the spindle axes,<br>
requires vertical lifting of the tool holder and/or the<br>
workpiece spindles, which requires high structural<br>
complexity.<br><br>
DE 102 56 222 A1 describes a gear hobbing machine for<br>
processing spiral bevel gears. A work wheel is arranged on a<br>
horizontally orientated workpiece spindle, with the<br>
workpiece spindle being arranged on a spindle carrier which<br>
can be rotated about a vertical axis of rotation (P). A tool<br>
spindle has a fixed pre-selectable angle of inclination K<br>
with respect to an orientation axis (0) and can be rotated<br>
about a horizontal axis (T). The workpiece spindle and tool<br>
spindle can be displaced linearly relative to each other in<br>
three spatial directions.<br>
An object of the invention is to reduce the contamination of<br>
the rotary holder and the tool spindles owing to chips which<br>
are removed during the processing of tooth formations of a<br>
workpiece in the machine tool and to reduce the structural<br>
complexity for a relative feed movement of the tool relative<br>
to the workpiece parallel with the spindle axes.<br>
The object is achieved according to the invention in that<br>
the main axis A of the rotary holder extends horizontally.<br>
In the machine tool according to the invention, the main<br>
axis A of the rotary holder and the spindle axes of the<br>
workpiece spindles arranged on the rotary holder are<br>
orientated at least substantially horizontally. This results<br>
in the advantage that, during the processing of a workpiece<br>
which is arranged, for example, clamped or gripped, on one<br>
of the workpiece spindles, chips which occur fall freely in<br>
a vertical direction owing to gravitational force and<br>
consequently do not fall onto the rotary holder. Chips which<br>
adhere to the workpiece spindle(s) are disengaged by the<br>
rotation of the workpiece spindle during the tooth formation<br>
processing or at least loosened to such an extent that the<br>
formation of clusters of chips is prevented. This results in<br><br>
the advantage that, in the machine tool according to the<br>
invention, it is substantially possible to dispense with<br>
additional devices and/or method steps for removing chips on<br>
the workpiece spindles and the rotary holder, whereby the<br>
processing cycle in the machine tool is further reduced and<br>
consequently the cycle rate is further increased.<br>
In particular in the case of dry processing, heating of the<br>
machine bed or the rotary holder owing to hot chips thereon<br>
does not occur. Thermal expansion associated with heating<br>
and therefore production inaccuracy are effectively<br>
prevented.<br>
The horizontal position of the workpiece spindles results in<br>
the additional advantage that a feed movement directed<br>
parallel with the spindle axes extends parallel with the<br>
main axis A and consequently horizontally, in other words a<br>
parallel feed movement can be brought about in the machine<br>
tool according to the invention without any vertical lifting<br>
movement. Within the context of the parallel feed,<br>
therefore, neither a massive workpiece spindle, or even the<br>
rotary holder, nor the tool holder which is also massive<br>
needs to be displaced counter to gravitational force.<br>
Instead, it is simply necessary to move, for example, the<br>
tool holder in a planar manner, which only requires friction<br>
forces to be overcome.<br>
In a preferred construction of the machine tool according to<br>
the invention, the tool holder can be displaced along a<br>
horizontal axis X which extends perpendicularly relative to<br>
the main axis A and along a horizontal linear axis Y which<br>
extends parallel with the main axis A.<br><br>
In this preferred construction, the tool holder can be moved<br>
or conveyed along the linear axis X towards a workpiece on<br>
the workpiece spindle which is located in a processing<br>
position. After a workpiece has finished being processed, at<br>
the end of a production time, the tool holder can be moved<br>
back out of its processing position again. Owing to the<br>
displaceability of the tool holder along the linear axis X,<br>
which is perpendicular relative to the spindle axis, it is<br>
possible to carry out machining methods with a tool held in<br>
the tool holder with a perpendicular feed movement such as,<br>
for example, dipping or radial methods. Methods with a<br>
parallel feed movement can be carried out owing to the<br>
displaceability of the tool holder along the linear axis Y<br>
which is parallel with the main axis A and the spindle axes<br>
by means of the machine tool according to the invention.<br>
Both linear axes X and Y extend horizontally so that, in<br>
order to displace the tool holder in those directions, only<br>
friction forces have to be overcome. In particular,<br>
displaceability of the tool holder is achieved along the<br>
workpiece or workpiece spindle axis without applying a<br>
lifting force. The installation costs of the machine tool<br>
and the production costs of a workpiece which is processed<br>
with the machine tool are reduced owing to that technical<br>
simplification of the construction.<br>
In another preferred construction of the machine tool<br>
according to the invention, the tool holder is arranged on a<br>
rotating holder which can be rotated about a horizontal axis<br>
of rotation B which extends perpendicularly relative to the<br>
main axis A.<br>
In this advantageous construction, the tool holder can be<br>
tilted or inclined, owing to the arrangement on the rotating<br>
holder, relative to the workpiece in a plane which extends<br><br>
perpendicularly relative to the axis of rotation B. This<br>
results in the advantage that toothed wheels having an<br>
oblique profile extent and worm gears can be produced by<br>
means of a tool which is positioned in an inclined manner.<br>
The tool holder is further preferably arranged on a tool<br>
carriage, with the tool carriage being movable relative to<br>
the rotating holder along a linear axis C which is<br>
perpendicular relative to the axis of rotation B.<br>
Such an additional direction of movement of the tool holder<br>
allows rapid changing of the active portion of the milling<br>
tool, in particular during rotation of the rotary holder as<br>
soon as an active portion of the tool has become blunt. Work<br>
can thereby be carried out with a milling tool for a longer<br>
time.<br>
The machine tool is further in the form of a gear hobbing<br>
device, in particular having a gear hobbing head, a hobbing<br>
shaving device, in particular having a shaving wheel, or a<br>
grinding device.<br>
Any number of teeth and profile modifications can be<br>
produced with the same tool on the workpiece by means of a<br>
machine tool configured for a gear hobbing method. Gear<br>
hobbing is suitable for preliminary and final processing of<br>
tooth formations, whereas hobbing shaving is used for final<br>
processing of workpieces, in particular toothed wheels, and<br>
grinding is used for final processing of hardened<br>
workpieces.<br>
In a preferred construction of the machine tool according to<br>
the invention, the rotary holder is in the form of a<br><br>
cylinder, in particular with the workpiece spindles<br>
projecting out of the cylinder.<br>
In a construction of the rotary holder as a preferably<br>
massive cylinder, vibrations of the tool spindles are<br>
minimised and consequently the production precision is<br>
increased. Arranging the workpiece spindles on an upper side<br>
of the cylinder affords the advantage that the workpiece<br>
spindles are secured in a plane which extends<br>
perpendicularly relative to the main axis A and protrude<br>
freely inside the machine tool so that chips fall freely at<br>
the workpiece spindles and the workpiece spindles can be<br>
loaded in a readily accessible manner.<br>
In a preferred configuration of the machine tool according<br>
to the invention, the rotary holder has a first stop and a<br>
second stop, with a first workpiece spindle being at a<br>
processing position and a second workpiece spindle being at<br>
a transfer position at each stop.<br>
In that configuration, the processing position in which a<br>
workpiece is processed on a workpiece spindle with a tool,<br>
and the transfer position, in which a workpiece spindle can<br>
have a workpiece loaded or unloaded, are fixed by the stops.<br>
Consequently, the workpiece spindles can be moved into the<br>
two positions simply by moving the rotary holder in rotation<br>
without it further being necessary to carry out measurements<br>
and/or adjustments.<br>
In another preferred construction of the invention, a<br>
motorised drive is provided on the rotary holder.<br>
The workpiece spindles arranged on the rotary holder can<br>
change between the processing position and the transfer<br><br>
position within a short space of time by means of the drive,<br>
whereby the processing cycle is further reduced. In the<br>
context of the invention, it is possible to carry out<br>
position changes of the workpiece spindles within one second<br>
or less. Together with the times for moving the tool in and<br>
out of 0.5 seconds or less for each operation, it is<br>
possible to achieve a cut-to-cut time of 2 seconds and less.<br>
Furthermore, preferably motorised spindle drives are<br>
provided on the workpiece spindles.<br>
The motor-driven workpiece spindles can be moved into the<br>
processing position in the driven state rotating about the<br>
spindle axis. The tool holder generally also has a motorised<br>
drive and the rotating tool engages with the rotating<br>
workpiece in a manner synchronised in terms of speed. The<br>
entire processing cycle which is composed of the processing<br>
time and a period of time for changing the position of the<br>
workpiece spindles is further reduced by changing the<br>
position of the workpiece spindles with the workpiece<br>
spindles being operative and with the tool being operative.<br>
In another preferred construction of the invention, the<br>
machine tool has a counter-holder which faces a workpiece<br>
spindle in a processing position, in particular with the<br>
counter-holder being programmable by means of a control<br>
processor.<br>
The workpiece spindle is stabilised by the counter-holder<br>
with respect to transverse forces which occur during the<br>
workpiece processing. The counter-holder is programmed in<br>
such a manner that it releases the workpiece spindle after<br>
processing for changing position.<br><br>
In another preferred construction of the machine tool<br>
according to the invention, a protective shield is provided<br>
on the rotary holder between the workpiece spindles, in<br>
particular with the main axis A extending through the<br>
protective shield.<br>
The rotary holder is subdivided by the protective shield<br>
into regions or portions each having a workpiece spindle.<br>
The protective shield which acts as a separating device<br>
prevents chips from being introduced from one region into<br>
another region so that mutual occurrences of contamination,<br>
in particular when a new workpiece is clamped, are<br>
prevented. In the case of workpiece spindles which are<br>
arranged symmetrically about the main axis, a symmetrical<br>
arrangement of the protective shield is advantageous, in<br>
particular through the main axis A in order to avoid<br>
unbalances during rotational movement of the rotary holder.<br>
In another configuration, the machine tool according to the<br>
invention has a deburring device for processing a workpiece<br>
on a workpiece spindle which is at a transfer position.<br>
A workpiece which is previously processed in the processing<br>
position can subsequently be processed, that is to say,<br>
deburred, by means of the deburring device before being<br>
unloaded at the transfer position. Cleaning of the workpiece<br>
may optionally also be carried out. Owing to the deburring<br>
device, it is possible to dispense with repeated clamping of<br>
the workpiece for a subsequent separate deburring operation.<br>
The deburring device is further preferably provided on an<br>
outer surface of the rotary holder.<br><br>
A spatial arrangement of the deburring device above and/or<br>
to the side of the workpiece spindle in the transfer<br>
position affords advantages with regard to handling the<br>
deburring device and structural complexity of the machine<br>
tool.<br>
The machine tool preferably has a clamping device for<br>
loading and unloading a workpiece in/from a workpiece<br>
spindle, with the workpiece spindle being at a transfer<br>
position.<br>
The clamping device can further reduce the time for loading<br>
and unloading the workpiece spindle. If the rotary holder,<br>
workpiece spindles, tool and/or the tool holder, and<br>
optionally the deburring device and the clamping device, are<br>
actuated together, the processing time and the position<br>
changing time, that is to say, the overall processing cycle,<br>
can be minimised.<br>
Further advantages of the invention will be appreciated from<br>
the Figure and the description of the drawing. The machine<br>
tool according to the invention is illustrated in one<br>
embodiment in the Figure of the drawing. The features shown<br>
in the Figure are purely schematic and should not be<br>
understood to be true to scale.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates an exemplary machine tool according to<br>
the invention for processing tooth formations of workpieces.<br>
Figure 1 is a schematic oblique view of a machine tool 1<br>
having a housing 2. A rotary holder 3 is arranged on a rear<br>
portion of the housing 2 in the Figure, with the rotary<br>
holder 3 being in the form of a cylinder and being supported<br>
so as to be rotatable about a main axis A. A first workpiece<br><br>
spindle 4a and a second workpiece spindle 4b are arranged at<br>
an upper side of the rotary holder 3 directed towards the<br>
inner side of the machine tool 1. The workpiece spindles 4a<br>
and 4b project out of the cylinder-like rotary holder 3 and<br>
are orientated parallel with the main axis A. In other<br>
words, the first workpiece spindle 4a has a first spindle<br>
axis Sa and the second workpiece spindle 4b has a second<br>
spindle axis Sb, with both spindle axes Sa and Sb extending<br>
parallel with the main axis A. The workpiece spindles 4a and<br>
4b are arranged symmetrically on the rotary holder 3, in<br>
this instance point-symmetrically relative to the main axis<br>
A, whereby unbalances are substantially avoided when the<br>
workpiece spindles 4a and 4b are moved by the rotary holder<br>
3 being rotated about the main axis A. The main axis A and<br>
consequently also the spindle axes Sa and Sb are orientated<br>
horizontally.<br>
The rotary holder 3 and the workpiece spindles 4a and 4b are<br>
motor-driven. A processing position and a transfer position<br>
for the workpiece spindles 4a, 4b are fixed by two stops<br>
which are provided on the rotary holder 3. The two workpiece<br>
spindles 4a, 4b each change between the processing position<br>
and the transfer position by the rotary holder 3 being<br>
rotated. In the Figure, the first workpiece spindle 4a is at<br>
the processing position and the second workpiece spindle 4b<br>
is at the transfer position.<br>
A substantially cylindrical tool holder 5, in which an<br>
elongate tool 50, for example, a gear hobber, is clamped or<br>
secured, is arranged beside the first workpiece spindle 4a.<br>
The tool 50 which is held in the tool holder 5 is stabilised<br>
in its position by a counter-bearing 51 which is secured at<br>
an opposite side of the housing 2. In the position<br>
illustrated, the tool 50 abuts a workpiece 6 which is<br><br>
arranged on the first workpiece spindle 4a. The tool 50 is<br>
able to be rotated about a tool rotation axis R in the tool<br>
holder 5, in particular by means of a motor.<br>
Whilst the workpiece 6 is being processed in the processing<br>
position by means of the tool 50, the second workpiece<br>
spindle 4b is unloaded at the same time at the transfer<br>
position and is subsequently loaded with a new workpiece.<br>
Owing to the simultaneous parallel execution of method steps<br>
at two different workpiece spindles 4a and 4b in two<br>
spatially separate positions, the processing position and<br>
the transfer position, the overall processing cycle is<br>
reduced because the production time and the non-production<br>
time occur in a parallel manner.<br>
The directly driven workpiece spindles 4a and 4b and the<br>
directly driven tool 50 allow a short processing time owing<br>
to high drive outputs and speeds, and consequently allow a<br>
high level of utilisation of the machine tool 1 to be<br>
achieved. It is possible to dispense with braking and/or<br>
slowing down the tool 50 or the tool holder 5 because the<br>
first workpiece spindle 4a is driven in a synchronised<br>
manner in terms of speed when it is introduced into the<br>
processing position, which results in further reduction in<br>
the processing cycle.<br>
The tool holder 5 is arranged on a rotating holder 7 which<br>
can be rotated about a horizontal axis of rotation B. The<br>
tool holder 5 can further be displaced along a horizontal<br>
linear axis X which extends perpendicularly relative to the<br>
main axis A and along a horizontal linear axis Y which<br>
extends parallel with the main axis A. To this end, the<br>
entire tool holder arrangement is arranged on a planar<br>
carrier 8. The carrier 8 can be displaced along a travel<br><br>
path 9 on rails 10a and 10b. The rails 10a and 10b are<br>
orientated parallel with the main axis A. Movement of the<br>
tool holder 5 along the linear axis X is brought about in<br>
that the rotating holder 7 is arranged in an elongate<br>
rotating holder housing 11, with the rotating holder housing<br>
11 being displaceable on the carrier 8 in the direction of<br>
the linear axis X. The linear axes X and Y are, similarly to<br>
the main axis A and the spindle axes Sa and Sb, orientated<br>
horizontally. Consequently, it is possible to move the tool<br>
holder 5 relative to the workpiece 6 and the first workpiece<br>
spindle 4a by linear displacements or movements in a<br>
horizontal plane, which leads to a vertical lifting movement<br>
being dispensed with and consequently a simplified structure<br>
of the machine tool 1.<br>
The tool holder 5 is further arranged on a substantially<br>
rectangular tool slide 12 and can be displaced therewith<br>
along a linear axis C relative to the rotating holder 7. The<br>
linear axis C is perpendicular relative to the axis of<br>
rotation B. Gear wheels having different profiles and<br>
numbers of teeth can be produced on the workpiece 6 owing to<br>
the directions of movement and degrees of freedom of the<br>
tool holder 5.<br>
A counter-holder 13 which is arranged at a side of the<br>
housing 2 opposite the rotary holder 3 is arranged opposite<br>
the first workpiece spindle 4a. The counter-holder 13 is<br>
orientated along the first spindle axis Sa and adjoins a tip<br>
of the first workpiece spindle 4a. In this manner, it<br>
stabilises the first workpiece spindle 4a in the processing<br>
position. Stabilising or locking the first workpiece spindle<br>
4a in the processing position or corresponding release by<br>
means of the counter-holder 13 can be brought about by an<br>
electronic control unit of the counter-holder 13.<br><br>
Chips which are produced when the workpiece 6 is processed<br>
by means of the machine tool 1 fall in a vertical direction<br>
downwards owing to gravitational force and are received at<br>
that location in a funnel-like chip collection device 14<br>
which is provided in the housing 2. The chip collection<br>
device 14 which is located below the workpiece spindles 4a<br>
and 4b is readily accessible from outside. Owing to the<br>
chips being discharged or falling in a vertical direction,<br>
contact between chips and the rotary holder 3 and the<br>
workpiece spindles 4a and 4b and particularly the drives<br>
provided thereon is substantially prevented.<br>
The loading and unloading of the second workpiece spindle 4b<br>
can be reduced by means of a clamping device. The production<br>
time, that is to say, the time for processing the workpiece<br>
6 in the processing position, can further be used in order<br>
to subsequently process a workpiece, which has previously<br>
been processed at that location, in the transfer position.<br>
To that end, a deburring device which is preferably secured<br>
to an outer surface 15 of the rotary holder 3 is<br>
advantageous. A deburring device which is arranged at the<br>
outer surface 15 engages laterally, in particular from<br>
above, with a workpiece on the second workpiece spindle 4b<br>
and consequently does not impair the accessibility of the<br>
transfer position. The efficiency of the machine tool 1 is<br>
further increased by loading and unloading and deburring<br>
parallel with the production time.<br>
Owing to a protective shield or a partition wall (not<br>
illustrated) between the workpiece spindles 4a, 4b arranged<br>
on the rotary holder 3, contact is prevented between chips<br>
which occur during the processing operation and non-<br>
processed workpieces and the corresponding workpiece<br><br>
spindles, and discharge of the chips into the chip<br>
collection device 14 is ensured.<br>
Additional horizontal arrangements of two or more workpiece<br>
spindles on a horizontally orientated rotary holder are<br>
conceivable. According to the invention, three workpiece<br>
spindles can also in particular be arranged on a<br>
horizontally orientated rotary holder, for example, in a<br>
state distributed about the main axis A at angular intervals<br>
of 120° with the same radial spacing.<br><br>
