ELECTRICAL APPARATUS EQUIPPED WITH AN AUXILIARY COVER<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to an electrical apparatus, in particular an electricity metering device equipped with an auxiliary terminal cover.<br>
The document DE-A-38 42 058 describes an electrical apparatus equipped with a terminal cover designed to prevent any unauthorized access to the electrical connections constituting the input or output connections of the apparatus. The electrical apparatus comprises a case in two parts with a base and a main cover. It is equipped with terminals with securing screws for fixing of connection cables of the main and auxiliary circuits of the apparatus. The terminals are situated in the main case and the securing screws are accessed via holes provided in the main cover. An auxiliary cover covers the holes which allow access to be had to the securing screws. This cover can be sealed in order to limit access to the terminals by unauthorized people. Preventing access to the terminals contributes in the first place to the safety of people who may have to work on the electrical system in which the apparatus is installed. Sealing is for its part used in all cases where proof is required of unauthorized operation or tampering with the equipment.<br>
This type of device does however give rise to a problem when the cables designed to be connected to the terminals of the apparatus are of a nature or a cross section such that this connection is problematic or impossible. This is the case for example when aluminium cables are required to be connected to terminals originally intended for copper cables. The<br><br>
difference between the expansion coefficients of aluminium and copper, added to the strong tendency of aluminium to oxidize at the surface in air by formation of a layer of insulating alumina, does in fact lead to recourse being had to terminals of different construction for these different cables.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the invention is to enable authorized personnel, in particular electrical fitters, to perform connection of cables of various cross sections or natures to an electrical apparatus, in particular an electricity metering device, quite simply while at the same time preventing unauthorized persons from having access to the connection points of said cables.<br>
According to the invention, this object is achieved by means of an electrical apparatus designed to be connected between an up-line electrical circuit and a down-line electrical circuit and comprising:<br>
a case comprising:<br>
a base,<br>
at least one hole for insertion of a connection cable of the up-line or<br>
down-line circuits,<br>
a main cover covering metering and / or electrical breaking means and<br>
preventing access thereto, and<br>
an auxiliary cover;<br><br>
at least one input or output connection terminal designed to receive a cable end, said terminal being securedly affixed to the base and equipped with securing means designed to perform fixing of said cable end with respect to the terminal, the auxiliary cover covering said securing means of the connection terminal and preventing access to said securing means,<br>
means securely affixed to the base and constituting at least one housing situated between the hole for insertion and the connection terminal and designed to receive an intermediate accessory cable connection terminal, the auxiliary cover being shaped in such a way as to cover said housing and to prevent access thereto.<br>
When the nature and cross section of the cable enable it to be connected directly to the terminals, the accessory terminal block is omitted. When the nature and / or cross section of the cable do not enable it to be connected directly to the terminals, it is possible to fit an intermediate accessory connection terminal block which is fixed in the housing and covered by the cover. In all cases, i.e. with or without an intermediate accessory terminal block, access to the end of the cable and to its connection point are prevented by a single cover. The solution has the advantage of not requiring multiple covers and sealings. It enables the space necessary for connection of the cables to be defined, regardless of the nature of the cables. The presence of a main cover distinct from the auxiliary cover enables access to the internal elements of the apparatus to be limited to authorized persons only, fitters having to be able to access the terminals not necessarily being included in these authorized persons.<br><br>
Advantageously, the connection terminal defines an axis of insertion of the corresponding cable end, and the housing is situated in the axial continuation of the terminal. Thus, the axis of insertion of the cable can remain identical, whether an accessory terminal is fitted or not.<br>
Advantageously, the housing comprises means designed for reversible fixing of the terminal block. This means may for example be a clipping tab or tapped holes for fixing by means of screw.<br>
Advantageously, the auxiliary cover is provided with sealing means. This arrangement enables access to the cable connections to be prevented, with or without accessory, by a single sealing.<br>
When necessary, an accessory connection terminal block is fixed in one of said housings. Advantageously, the accessory terminal block comprises a metal tunnel for receipt of a cable end and a connecting bridge one end of which is electrically connected to the connection terminal and the other end of which is electrically connected to said tunnel. The bridge is advantageously formed by a metal plate of appropriate shape.<br>
Preferably, the intermediate accessory cable connection terminal block is fixed in its housing by removable fixing means such as screws or clipping means.<br>
Preferably, the intermediate accessory cable connection terminal block comprises in addition a pad made of conducting material fixed in removable manner on the tunnel or<br><br>
the bridge. The pad enables different cables to be fitted on the same accessory terminal support.<br>
Preferably, the intermediate accessory cable connection terminal block is equipped with securing means designed to perform fixing of a cable end with respect to the tunnel and the auxiliary cover covers the securing means of the terminal block and prevents access thereto.<br>
Advantageously, the auxiliary cover partially covers the main cover and prevents removal or opening of the latter. This arrangement makes it possible to impose checking of the cables before opening the cover giving access to the internal elements of the apparatus.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
With reference to figure 1, an electrical metering apparatus 10 comprises miscellaneous elements such as a circuit breaker 12, a magnetic prepayment card reader 14 and a printed circuit board 16 supporting various electronic components, as well as a terminal block 18 equipped with input terminals 20 and output terminals 22. The terminal block 18 comprises four locations, but in the figures only two are in fact occupied by terminals 20 and 22.<br>
In the continuation of the terminal block 18, on the opposite side from the other elements 12, 14, 16, housings 24 are constituted for intermediate accessory connection terminal blocks 26. In figure 1, two housings 24 can be seen each corresponding to a double terminal block, i.e. comprising two connection terminals, one of the housings being occupied by a double accessory connection terminal block 26 and the other one being empty. Each housing comprises positioning slides 28. Oblong holes 30 and tapped holes 32 are provided for fixing of the accessory terminal blocks.<br>
The accessory connection terminal blocks 26 are designed to enable electrical equipment to be connected to up-line and/or down-line circuits whose cables have characteristics which are not compatible with those of the terminals 20, 22 of the electrical equipment.<br><br>
This may for example involve adapting the diameter of the cables. It may also involve adapting to the material constituting the conductor of the cables.<br>
In figures 2 and 3, a double accessory connection terminal block 26 comprises a body 34 made of insulating plastic material and, for each connection, a metal tunnel 36, an upper pad 38 movable in translation along the axis of a securing screw 40 whose head can be seen in figure 3, and a bridge 42 formed by an S-shaped metal part one end of which is inserted in the tunnel 36 and the other end of which constitutes a protruding strip. Optionally, the accessory terminal block can in addition be provided with fitting pads 44 described in a more complete manner in the French Patent application bearing the reference number 9,805,122. These pads are U-shaped and comprise corrugations designed to penetrate into an aluminium cable by clamping.<br>
The body 34 of the accessory terminal block is provided with two tabs 46 enabling insertion thereof in the holes 30. It comprises at its bottom part a shoulder 48 for a fixing screw which can be inserted in the tapped hole 32.<br>
With reference to figures 4 to 6, the assembly is placed in a case 50 composed of a base 52, a main cover 54 and an auxiliary cover 56 (figure 6). The main cover 54 completely covers all the elements which are not intended to be accessible to the fitter or the user. At one of its ends it forms a flat shoulder 58 partially covering the terminals 20, 22, and comprising holes 60 giving access to securing screws 62 of the terminals 20, 22, thus enabling cable ends to be secured in the terminals 20, 22 through the main cover 54. The auxiliary cover 56 covers the holes 60 so as to prevent access to the securing screws 62 of<br><br>
the terminal blocks. It also totally covers the housings 24 of the accessory connection terminal blocks 26 and, when the latter are present, enables the accessory connection terminal blocks 26, including the securing screws 40, to be covered.<br>
The auxiliary cover 56 therefore operates in conjunction with the base 52 and the main cover 54 so as to confine a closed volume for housing the incoming and outgoing cables. Cutouts 64, 66, able to be knocked out are arranged respectively in the auxiliary cover and in the base, in the continuation of the terminals 18, 20 and accessory terminal block housings 24 to enable the cables to exit. Seals 68 or plugs are inserted in these cutouts.<br>
The shoulder 58 of the main cover 54 partially covering the terminals 20, 22 is itself covered by the auxiliary cover 56, when the latter is in place, so that it is not possible to remove the main cover 54 without having removed the auxiliary cover 56 beforehand.<br>
The auxiliary cover 56 is equipped with a stay 70 which is aligned with a corresponding stay 72 securely affixed to the base 52. The stays 70 and 72 are provided with a bore enabling a sealable fixing screw 74, represented in figure 7, to be inserted and tightened. A drilled hole passes right through the head of the screw. At the end of tightening of the screw, the hole is aligned with a groove 78 of the auxiliary cover in order to insert a sealing wire (not represented) in the hole 76.<br>
The main cover 54 and auxiliary cover 56 are thus designed to enable the fitter to have access to the elements of the apparatus necessary for connection of the incomers and outgoers while preventing access to the internal elements of the apparatus. If the cable to<br><br>
be connected is compatible with the terminals 18, 20 of the apparatus, the end of the cable is inserted directly in the terminal and the screw 62 then secures the assembly. If the cable is incompatible with the corresponding terminal 18, 20, the fitter first of all fits an accessory connection terminal block 26 and connects this terminal block on one side to the terminal 20, 22 concerned, by means of the bridge 42, secured by the screw 62. Then he inserts the end of the cable in the tunnel 36 of the accessory terminal block before performing tightening by means of the screw 40.<br>
Various modifications are naturally possible. The double accessory connection terminal blocks 26 of the embodiment example can be replaced by individual accessory connection terminal blocks, i.e. only enabling one cable to be connected to a terminal of the apparatus.<br>
Also, should it be made necessary by the required use, two distinct auxiliary covers can be provided, one for connection of incomers and the other for connection of outgoers, or feeders.<br>
The circuit breaker 12 can be replaced by any breaking device: switch, fuse, etc...<br>
The axis of insertion of the cable in the accessory terminal block 26 may not be aligned with the latter enabling the cable to be inserted in the terminals 20, 22. It is in fact possible to enlarge the oblong holes 30 so as to enable cables to exit via the rear of the base of the apparatus, or even to extend these oblong holes on the face of the base comprising the cutouts 66, in order to replace the latter. An accessory terminal block can<br><br>
then be used whose terminals would be able to be directed on the cable side by pivoting through an angle of 90°.<br><br><br><br>
