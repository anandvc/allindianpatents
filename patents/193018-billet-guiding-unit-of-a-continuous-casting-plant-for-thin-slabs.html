BACKGROUND   BF   THE   INVENTION<br>
1.      Field  of   the   Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a billet guiding unit of a continuous casting plant for thin slabs  wherein guide rolls are supported on oppositely located frames  wherein the frames are tensioned relative to each other against stop surfaces by means of tension  rods <br>
2.     Description  of  the  Related  Art<br>
DE-Al 26 12 094 discloses a billet guiding unit in which the frame supporting the bearings of the guide rolls are connectedâ€žby several tension rods, wherein the distance between the frame components is determined by an annular bracket mounted on each tension rod and by spacer members. For tensioning the frame  two sleeves supported against each other with inclined screw-shaped surfaces are rotated by a pressure medium cylinder  When the billet becomes jammed, the bushings are rotated in an unloading direction.<br><br>
DE-Al 43 06 853 discloses a billet guiding unit of a continuous casting plant for continuous casting and rolling of thin slabs, wherein the frames of the billet guiding unit are connected by piston/cylinder units, and wherein an annular hydraulic cylinder and a spacer member each are arranged between stop surfaces of the upper and lower frames. By means of this unit, the guide rolls supported on the frames are adjusted into three defined positions during continuous  casting.<br>
The known billet guiding units described above are complicated and  subject   to  malfunction.<br><br>
SUMMARY  OF   THE   INVENTION<br>
In view of the above-described prior art, the present invention deals with the following problem.- Aside from the state of alignment of the billet guide unit, the actual distance between the guide rolls of the above-described billet guiding unit which determines the cross section of the billet during the casting operation depends on the pretension condition of the tension rods and on the temperature. Consequently, the thin slabs emerging from the billet guiding unit may have wedge-shaped cross sectional shapes because the cross section of the billet is determined by the actual spacing between the rolls in the area of final solidification.<br>
Therefore, it is the primary object of the present invention to provide a billet guiding unit with frames which are mechanically tensioned relative to each other by means of tension rods, in which it is possible during casting to compensate in a simple manner for an inaccurate alignment or unequal thermal expansion or wear of the guide rolls mounted on the frames which results in thickness variations  over  the   cross   section  of   the   slab.<br><br>
In accordance with the present invention, hydraulic cylinders for extending or stretching the tension rods are mounted between corresponding  stop  surfaces   of   the   frames.<br>
The configuration according to the present invention makes possible a compensation of thickness variations over the cross section of the slab with a simple, mechanically structured and, thus, operationally safe billet guiding unit. In this connection, the invention is based on the finding that the differences in dimension can be fully compensated by the achievable extension of the  tension  rods.<br>
In accordance with another feature of the present invention, the annular hydraulic cylinders surround the tension rods between the  stop  surfaces  of   the  frames.<br>
The  annular  hydraulic  cylinders  are  connected  to  a	hydraulic<br>
pressure   source   through  a  valve  which   is   supplied  with	a   control<br>
signal   from  a   control   means   including   a   slab   thickness	measuring<br>
device  and  a  computer.<br>
The distance between oppositely located rows of rolls of the frames are corrected by determining a lower deviation side of the slab  by  carrying  out   a   continuous  measurement   of   the   thickness  of<br><br>
the slab sides, by determining from the difference of the dimensions the required extension of the tension rods on the lower deviation side and by applying to the hydraulic cylinders the pressure required for the extension of the tension rods.<br>
When the pressure is applied to the hydraulic cylinders, it is advantageous to take into consideration ^e state of pretensioning of tiie tension rods and / or the position of the pool tip within the billet guiding segment.<br>
A billet guiding unit of a continuous casting plant for thin slabs, the guiding unit comprising oppositely located frames, guide rolls mounted on each frame, the frames having stop surfaces facing each other, tension rods extending thoroughly the frames and comprising means for tensioning die tension rods relative to the frames, and hydraulic cylinders mounted between the stop surfaces of the frames for extending the tension rods.<br>
The various features of novelty which characterize the invention are pointed out with particularity in the  claims annexed to and forming a part of tick disclosure. For a better understanding of the invention, its operating advantages, specific objects attained by its use, reference should be had to   drawing and descriptive matter in which there are illustrated and described preferred embodiments of the invention.<br>
X 9 JAN 2003 DUPLICATE<br><br>
BRIEF  DESCRIPTION  OF  THE  DRAWING<br>
In  the  drawing:<br>
Fig. 1 is a schematic illustration of a continuous casting plant  for  thin  slabs,-<br>
Fig. 2 is a side view, on a larger scale, of a portion of the billet  guiding  unit  of  the  continuous  casting  plant;<br>
Fig. 3 is a top view, also on a larger scale and partially in section,   of  the  billet  guiding unit  in  billet  travel  direction;  and<br>
Fig.- 4 is a schematic view showing the annular hydraulic cylinders and the control circuit for the annular hydraulic cylinders.<br><br>
DESCRIPTION  OF  THE   PREFERRED   EMBODIMENT<br>
In the continuous casting plant schematically illustrated in Fig. 1 of the drawing, a continuous casting mold 1 for thin slabs 2 is followed by a billet guiding unit including a first section 3 and a second section 4. The cast slab 2 is conveyed by means of a driving unit 5 through the guiding unit 3, 4 formed by support guide rolls 6, wherein a liquid core of the billet is finally solidified as a result of cooling when emerging from the section 4. The thickness profile of the slab 2 is determined by measuring devices 7 underneath the guiding unit 3, 4. The slab 2 is then deflected  by  means  of  deflection  roll  8.<br>
As illustrated in Figs. 2 and 3 of the drawing,^ the support guide rolls 6 of the second section 4 of the guiding unit are mounted on oppositely located frames 9, 10. The frames 9, 10 have on both sides thereof essentially cylindrical end pieces 11, 12 with openings 13 for tension rods 14, 15. At their ends projecting out of the frames 9, 10, the tension rods 14, 15 are provided with nuts 16 for adjusting the desired distance between the support guide  rolls   6   and,   thus,   the  thickness  of   the   solidified  slab  2.<br><br>
Annular hydraulic cylinders 17, 18 surrounding the tension rods 14, 15 are arranged between corresponding end faces of the end pieces 11, 12. The frames 9, 10 are pretension through the tension rods 14, 15 and nuts 16 against the annular hydraulic cylinders 17, 18 with a force which is greater than the aerostatic force acting on the guiding unit from the proportional section of the  not  fully  solidified  slab.<br>
A control unit illustrated in Fig. 4 is provided for the annular hydraulic cylinders 17, 18. The components of the control unit are measuring devices 7, computer 19, hydraulic pressure source 21, pressure limiting valve 22 and multiple-way valve 20. From a difference of dimensions determined by the measuring devices 7, the computer forms signals for the pressure limiting valve 22 and the multiple-way valve 20 for applying pressure to the annular hydraulic cylinders 17 or 18 located at the lower deviation side of the slab 2 for obtaining a uniform cross sectional profile in accordance with the required extension of the tension rods 14 or 15 and  for  obtaining  a  uniform  cross  section  of  the  slab.<br>
The invention is not limited to the illustrated embodiment. In particular, for changing the size, exchangeable spacer members can  be  mounted  between  the   frame  surfaces,   wherein  conventional<br><br>
hydraulic  cylinders  are  arranged  outside  of  and  separately  from  the tension  rods   14,   15  between  the   frames  9,   10.<br>
While specific embodiments of the invention have been shown and described in detail to illustrate the inventive principles, it will be understood that the invention may be embodied otherwise without  departing  from  such  principles.<br><br><br>
