				<td>The invention relates to a melt blown/device for the<br>
production of melt blown products by way of a nozzle<br>
releasing filaments, with a continuously moveable deposit<br>
screen being provided underneath of the nozzle, onto which<br>
the filaments for the melt blown product can be deposited,<br>
and a suction device for suctioning air through the deposit<br>
screen being provided at the deposit screen.<br>
In a melt blown arrangement and/or during the melt blown<br>
process the polymer melt released from the nozzle is impinged<br>
by blast air flow. This causes the melt to form polymer<br>
fibers, which subsequently are deposited on the deposit<br>
screen for the melt blown product.<br>
In the melt blown arrangements of the type mentioned on the<br>
outset and known from practical operation, which the<br>
invention is based upon, only a single suctioning channel<br>
and/or suctioning area is provided in the deposit region of<br>
the filaments, to which a suctioning blower is allocated<br>
below the deposit screen. From the arrangements known,<br>
frequently melt blown products are yielded that are provided<br>
with undesired irregularities and/or inhomogeneities. In the<br>
suctioning area and/or in the region of the deposit screen of<br>
these melt blown arrangements known, frequently a more or<br>
less intense floating of fibers occurs, causing an<br>
uncontrolled deposition of the fibers and, thus,<br>
irregularities in the melt blown product. In particular,<br>
these irregularities relate to the product thickness, the air<br>
permeability, and the ratio of lateral strength /<br>
longitudinal strength of the fiber mat produced as well as to<br>
irregularities in the surface of the melt blown product. As a<br>
result, the product quality of the melt blown product is<br>
lower than desired.<br>
In contrast thereto, the invention is based on the technical<br>
problem to provide a melt blown arrangement of the type<br>
mentioned on the outset, by which melt blown products can be<br>
produced that are characterized in homogeneity and evenness<br>
with regard to their characteristics, and, in particular,<br>
i<br>
which are provided with an optimal surface quality as well.<br>
The object $# to primarily enable the production of melt<br>
blown products, which are provided with a consistent product<br>
thickness and a constant ratio of lateral strength /<br>
longitudinal strength. The air permeability shall also be as<br>
consistent as possible on various placee of the melt blown<br>
product.<br>
In order to solve the above-mentioned technical problem the<br>
invention teaches a melt b'lown arrangement of the type<br>
mentioned on the outset, characterized in that, in its<br>
longitudinal direction, the deposit screen is provided with<br>
several suctioning areas, independent from one another, one<br>
of these suctioning areas being a primary suctioning area<br>
allocated to the deposit region, and the suctioning speed in<br>
the individual suctioning areas can be adjusted independently<br>
from one another.<br>
The travel direction and/or transportation direction of the<br>
deposit screen characterizes the longitudinal direction of<br>
the deposit screen. Therefore, the several suctioning areas<br>
separated from one another are arranged behind one another,<br>
seen- in Che travel direction and/or transportation direction<br>
of the deposit screen. The term deposit region defines the<br>
area of the deposit screen, onto which the majority of the<br>
filaments is deposited and/or onto which all or almost all of<br>
the filaments are deposited. In each of the suctioning areas<br>
the suctioning speed can be adjusted separately and<br>
independently from the other suctioning areas. The suctioning<br>
speed defines the speed of the air auctioned through and/or<br>
to the deposit screen in m/s. The suctioning device and/or<br>
the suctioning blowers of the suctioning device is/are<br>
practically arranged below the deposit screen.<br>
The scope of this invention includes the fact that the nozzle<br>
releasing the filaments is embodies as a melt blown blowing<br>
head. Furthermore, the scope of this invention includes that<br>
the nozzle of the melt blown arrangement is provided with a<br>
multitude of jet holes and/or jet apertures arranged in a row<br>
for the release of polymer melt. Therefore, only a single row<br>
of jet apertures is provided. Furthermore, the melt blown<br>
arrangement according to the invention is preferably provided<br>
with a longitudinal nozzle for the release of tempered blast<br>
air, and this blast air impinges the polymer melt and/or the<br>
exiting filaments.<br>
Preferably, at least three suctioning areas, separated from<br>
one another, are provided behind one another in the<br>
longitudinal direction and/or in the travel direction of the<br>
deposit screen. Here, one of these suctioning areas is the<br>
primary suctioning area. According to a very preferred<br>
embodiment, which is of particular importance within the<br>
scope of the invention, four suctioning areas, separated from<br>
one another, are provided, and here, an initial suctioning<br>
area and a second suctioning area is provided in front of the<br>
primary suctioning area in relation to the travel direction<br>
of the deposit screen, and, additionally, a third suctioning<br>
area is provided here behind the primary suctioning area in<br>
the travel direction of the deposit screen. ThiB embodiment<br>
with four suctioning areas that are independent from one<br>
another, as proven particularly suitable within the scope of<br>
the invention.<br>
The scope of the invention includes the fact that the<br>
suctioning speed in the primary auctioning area is higher<br>
than the one in the other suctioning areas. Therefore, in the<br>
embodiment having four sucticning areas separated from one<br>
another, the auctioning speed in the primary suctioning area<br>
is higher than the suctioning speed in the first, second, and<br>
third suctioning area. It is advantageous for the suctioning<br>
speed in the primary auction area to be at least twice as<br>
high as the suctioning speed in each of the other suctioning<br>
areas. Preferably, the suctioning speed in the primary<br>
suctioning area is at least twice as high as the suctioning<br>
speed in the first suctioning area and/or in the second<br>
suctioning area. Preferably, the suctioning speed in the<br>
primary suctioning area is furthermore at least twice as high<br>
as the suctioning speed in the third suctioning area.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, each<br>
suctioning area is provided with a suctioning blower c£ its<br>
own. Therefore, the suctioning device of the melt blown<br>
arrangement according to this embodiment is provided with<br>
several suctioning blowers. At each suctioning blower, the<br>
auctioning speed can be separately adjusted for each<br>
suctioning area. Therefore, an independent adjustment of the<br>
suctioning air flow occurs in each auctioning area. The<br>
auctioned volume stream can be adjusted absolutely<br>
independently from one another. Here, the adjustment can be<br>
performed with the condition that the auctioning power in the<br>
primary suctioning area is twice as high as the one in each<br>
of the other suctioning areas.<br>
Advantageously, the individual suctioning area are -separated<br>
from one another by means of limiting walls made from sheet<br>
metal. Here, preferably vertically oriented sheet metal is<br>
used. Vertically in this context includes essentially<br>
vertical as well.<br>
The invention is based on the finding that the deposit of a<br>
melt blown product and/or a non-woven web can be controlled<br>
via the melt blown arrangement according to the invention<br>
optimally and securely operating. With the embodiment<br>
according to the invention an undesired floating of fibers in<br>
the area of the deposit screen can be eliminated and/or<br>
efficiently reduced. By way of embodying the various<br>
suctioning areas a very homogenous fiber deposit can be<br>
achieved and, surprisingly, inhomcgeneities in the melt blown<br>
products deposited can be largely minimized. Disturbing<br>
sections of higher or lower thickness in the melt blown<br>
product produced are not observed. Additionally, disturbing<br>
inhomogeneities regarding the air permeability of the non-<br>
woven web or regarding the ratio of lateral strength <br>
longitudinal strength can be excluded. Furthermore, the<br>
primary auctioning area can be embodied shorter with respect<br>
to the longitudinal direction and/or the transportation<br>
direction of the deposit screen compared to the auctioning<br>
area provided in melt blown arrangements known from practical<br>
use. Thus resulting in advantageous energy savings, because<br>
the overall volume stream of suctioned air can be reduced.<br>
without the separation in various suctioning areas according<br>
to the invention a single suctioning area in the deposit<br>
region, requiring a high suctioning speed, had to be embodied<br>
with larger dimensions in the transportation direction of the<br>
depoait screen. Therefore, in the melt blown arrangements<br>
known an unnecessarily high volume stream is suctioned, which<br>
again calls for high energy expenses.<br>
In the following, the invention is explained in greater<br>
detail using accompaying drawings for demonstration only that show an<br>
exemplary embodiment. They show in a schematic drawing:<br>
Fig. 1 a side view of a melt blown arrangement according<br>
to the invention and<br>
Fig. 2 an enlarged section A of Fig. 1.<br>
The figures show a melt blown arrangement according to the<br>
invention for the production of melt blown products, namely<br>
of non-woven webs. The melt blown arrangement is provided<br>
with a nozzle 1 with the filaments 3 being extruded tnrough<br>
ice jet apertures 2. Advantageously, the nozzle 1 in the<br>
exemplary embodiment is provided with a row comprising a<br>
multitude of jet apertures 2. The filaments 2 are impinged by<br>
tempered blast air 4, its direction of flow being shown in<br>
the figures by way of corresponding arrows. Underneath of<br>
nozzle 1 a continuously movable deposit screen 5 is provided,<br>
onto which the filaments 3 for the melt blown non-woven web<br>
can be deposited. Air is suctioned through the deposit screen<br>
5, so that the filaments 3 are more or less suctioned onto<br>
the deposit screen,<br>
According to the invention, the deposit screen 5 is provided<br>
with four suctioning areas 6, 7, 8, 9, separated from one<br>
another. One of these sauctioning area 6. 7, 8,9 is the<br>
primary suctioning area 8 allccated to the depcait region.<br>
The deposit region is defined by that area or. the deposit<br>
screen 5, on which at least the majority of the filaments 3<br>
are deposited. According to the .nventicr., the suctioning<br>
speed in the suctioning areas 6. 7, 8,9 can each be adjusted<br>
independently from one another. The auctioning speed in the<br>
primary suctioning region 8 is nigher than the one in the<br>
other suctioning areas 6, 7, 9. Additionally, the auctioning<br>
speed in the second suctioninag area 7 is advantageously<br>
higher than the suctioning speed in the first, suctioning area<br>
6. - According to a preferred embodiment of the invention,<br>
each suctioning area 6, 7, 8, 9 is proviced with a suctioning<br>
blower (not shown) of its own. Therefore, the suctioning<br>
speed for the respective suctioning area d. 7, 8, 9 can be<br>
separately adjusted at each suctioning blower and allows an<br>
independent control and/or adjustment the suctioned all<br>
flow in each sucticning are 6,7,8,9. Advantageously, in<br>
the exemplary embodiment the individual suctioning areas are<br>
separated from one another via limiting walla 10 made from<br>
sheet metal.<br>
In Fig. 2, in particular, the exiting filaments 3 and the<br>
flow direction of the blast air 4 and the flow direction of<br>
the suctioned secondary air 11 are discernible, as well.<br>
According to the invention, the separation in the individual<br>
auctioning areas 6, 7, 8, 9 and the direction of the blast<br>
air 4 as well as the direction of the secondary air 11 can be<br>
adjusted such that a very functional and homogenous deposit<br>
of the filaments is possible and, thus, surprisingly<br>
homogenous product characteristics can be achieved. According<br>
to the invention, the third suctioning area 9, arranged<br>
behind the primary auctioning area 8, serves for the<br>
effective contact of the melt blown product produced to the<br>
deposit screen 5. The invention is based on the knowledge<br>
that, without this third suctioning area 9, the melt blown<br>
product produced might be undesirably influenced by the<br>
secondary air suctioned by the blast air exiting with high<br>
speeds. The separation into the suctioning areas 6, 7, 8, 9<br>
according to the invention minimizes disturbing and undesired<br>
influences of any air flow.<br>
