A METHOD OF PRAPARING THIAZOLIDINEDIONES <br><br>
OVAZOLIDINE DIONES AND HYDANTOIN DERIVATIVE<br>
PPG-SIPSY of Z.I. LA CROIX-CADEAU,  F-49242 AVRILLE CEDEX FRANCE, FRENCH Company<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br>
GRANTED<br>
24-7-2003<br><br>
The present invention pertains to a new method for the preparation of thiazolidinedione, oxazolidinedione and hydantoin derivative compounds of formula (I) from compounds of formula (II) below:<br><br>
In which<br>
-	Q represents an oxygen atom or a sulfur atom;<br>
-	Ql represents an oxygen atom or a sulfur atom;<br>
-	Rl and R2, which can be identical or different, represent a hydrogen atom, a C1-10 alkyl chain, a cycloalkyl, an alkylaryl, an arylalkyl; said alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkylaryl or arylalkyl groups being optionally substituted by an alkyl, an alkoxy or aryloxy, a halogen, a hydroxy, a sulfino, a sulfonyl, an amino such as NH2, NHR3 N(R3)2 with R3 representing an alkyl, an alkoxy or an alkylcarbonyl.<br>
The thiazolidinedione, oxazolidinedione and hydantoin derivative compounds of formula (I) are known as synthesis intermediaries for the preparation of active pharmaceutical principles or as active pharmaceutical agents such as, for example, pioglitazone, rosiglitazone, troglitazone and ciglitazone,<br>
Known in the prior art are methods for the preparation of thiazolidinedione, Oxazolidinedione, and hydantoin derivative compounds:<br>
-	via reduction in the presence of a metal hydride as described in international patent application WO 98/37073/ or<br>
-	via reduction in the presence of a transition metal as described in European patent EP 257781,<br>
-	or via reduction in the presence of magnesium and methanol as described in international patent application WO 98/37073.<br><br><br>
These various methods present the disadvantages of generating large amounts of impurities, which can exceed 10% in the synthesis of pioglitazone, of using a large amount of catalyst or solvent, and of having a selectivity problem in the isolation of the resultant compound of formula (I).<br>
The method according to the invention presents the advantages of preparing said compounds of formula (I) while generating low amounts of impurities, of obtaining a total transformation rate, of eliminating the use of large amounts of solvent, of being selective and of easily isolating the product of formula (I). The method according to the present invention thus makes it possible to reduce the economic costs of industrial production of compounds of formula (I)-<br>
The present invention thus has as its object a method for the preparation of a thiazolidinedione, oxazolodinedione or hydantoin derivative compound of formula (I) from a compound of formula (II) below:<br><br>
in which Q, Ql, Rl and R2 have the same meanings as above, characterized in that a compound of formula (II) is brought to react with formic acid, either as a hydrogen donor in a hydrogen-transfer reaction or as a solvent in a hydrogenation reaction, in the presence of a catalyst based on a transition metal, in order to obtain the corresponding compound of formula (I).<br>
The formic acid used can be formic acid at 100% or a solution containing formic acid with a formic acid level that can range from 0.1 to 99% as long as<br><br><br>
said solution can dissolve the compound of formula (II). Said solution can be an aqueous solution or an organic solution or a mixture of these two.<br>
The transition-metal based catalyst employed either in the hydrogen-transfer reaction or in the hydrogenation reaction is advantageously selected from a homogeneous or heterogeneous catalyst.<br>
