[0011] Figure 2 is an exploded perspective front view of the instrument panel beam assembly shown in Figure 1.<br>
[0012] Figure 3 is an exploded perspective rear view of the instrument panel beam assembly shown in Figure 1.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0013] An instrument panel beam assembly that includes a thermoplastic beam structure having integrally molded-in HVAC ducts and energy absorbers is described below in detail. The thermoplastic beam structure supports the decorative panel(s) of the instrument panel. The integrally molded-in HVAC ducts and energy absorbers result in fewer parts than known instrument panel structures which provides for simplified instrument panel fabrication and lower fabrication labor costs.<br>
[0014] The thermoplastic beam structure can be molded from one of many thermoplastic materials. Suitable thermoplastic materials include, but are not limited to, acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS), polycarbonate, polycarbonate/ABS blend, a copolycarbonate-polyester, acrylic-styrene-acrylonitrile (ASA), acrylonitrile-(ethylene-polypropylene diamine modified)-styrene (AES), phenylene ether resins, glass filled blends of polyphenylene oxide and polystyrene, blends of polyphenylene ether/polyamide (NORYL GTX® from General Electric Company), blends of polycarbonate/PET/PBT, polybutylene terephthalate and impact modifier (XENOY® resin from General Electric Company), polyamides, phenylene sulfide resins, polyvinyl chloride PVC, high impact polystyrene (HIPS), low/high density polyethylene, polypropylene and thermoplastic olefins (TPO).<br>
[0015] Referring to the drawings, Figure 1 is a perspective view of an instrument panel beam assembly 10 in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, and Figures 2 and 3 are exploded perspective front and rear views of beam assembly 10 respectively. Instrument panel beam assembly 10 includes a molded thermoplastic beam structure 12, with a steering column support 14, a center stack 16 and end brackets 18 and 20 attached to beam structure 12. A floor bracket 21 couples center stack 16 to a floor pan (not shown) of an automobile.<br>
[0016] Beam structure 12 is formed by a front beam member 22, a rear beam member 24, and a defrost plenum member 26. Front beam member 22 includes molded-in HVAC duct channels, specifically, side window defrost duct channel 28 and main air conditioning duct channel 32. Rear beam member 24 includes corresponding HVAC duct channels molded into a first side 34 of rear beam member 24. Specifically, side window defrost duct channels 36 and 38, and main air conditioning duct channel 40 are molded into first side 34 of rear beam member 24. Front and rear beam members are coupled together with corresponding side window defrost duct channels 28, 36, and 38 forming side window defrost ducts 42 and 44, and main air conditioning duct channels 32 and 40 forming a main air conditioning duct 46. Front beam member 22 also includes a plurality of air conditioning duct outlets 48.<br>
[0017] A second side 50 of rear beam member 24 includes a molded-in front window defrost duct channel 52. Defrost plenum 26 includes corresponding molded-in duct channels, specifically, a front window defrost duct channel 54 and side window defrost duct connection channels 56 and 58. Rear beam member 24 and defrost plenum 26 are coupled together with corresponding front window defrost duct channels 52 and 54 forming a front window defrost duct 60, and side window defrost duct connection channels 56 and 58 connecting to side window defrost ducts 42 and 44.<br>
[0018] Front beam member 22 and rear beam member 24, in one  exemplary embodiment, are coupled by vibration welding, and in alternate embodiments by at least one of heat bonding, adhesive bonding, and fasteners. Also, rear beam member 24 and defrost plenum 26, in one exemplary embodiment, are coupled by vibration welding, and in alternate embodiments by at least one of heat bonding, adhesive bonding, and fasteners.<br>
[0019] A plurality of energy absorbers 66 extend from a bottom side edge 68 of front beam member 22. Energy absorbers 66 and a main body portion 70 of front beam member 22 are molded as one piece. Knee bolsters (not shown) are part of an instrument panel and are supported by energy absorbers 66. During an impact situation, energy is transferred from a passenger knee to a knee bolster and to energy absorbers 66. The deformation of energy absorbers 66 dissipates the energy and prevents injury to the passenger knee, in the exemplary embodiment, energy absorbers 66 have a substantially D-shape configuration. In alternate embodiments, energy absorbers 66 can have any suitable shape that is capable of deforming from the force of a vehicle occupant's knee against the knee bolster in an impact event, and thereby absorbing energy from the occupant's knee. A C-channel support rod 72 extends between energy absorbers 66. C-channel support rod 72 includes a glove box hinge 74.<br>
[0020] A plurality of stiffening ribs 76 extend from an outer surface 78 of front beam member 22. Stiffening ribs 76 are positioned between side window defrost duct channels 28 and 30 and main air conditioning duct channel 32.<br>
[0021] Steering column support 14 is formed from an upper steering column support member 80 and a lower steering column support member 82. Upper and lower steering support members 80 and 82 are coupled together with, for example, fasteners. Steering column support 14 is coupled to beam structure 12 with, for example, fasteners. Lower steering support member 82 includes a pedal bracket portion 84 for attaching the vehicle accelerator and brake pedals 86 and 88.<br>
[0022] End brackets 18 and 20 attach to opposing ends 90 and 92 of beam structure 12. End brackets 18 and 20 are configured to attach to an automobile body to secure beam structure 12 within a passenger compartment of an automobile.<br>
[0023] The above described instrument panel beam assembly 10 that includes a thermoplastic beam structure 12 having integrally molded-in HVAC ducts and energy absorbers 66 supports the decorative panel(s) of the instrument panel. The integrally molded-in HVAC ducts 42, 44, and 46, and energy absorbers 66 result in fewer parts than known instrument panel structures which provides for simplified instrument panel fabrication and lower fabrication labor costs.<br>
