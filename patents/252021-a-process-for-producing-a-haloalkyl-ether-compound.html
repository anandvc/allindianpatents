				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a process for producing a haloalkyl ether compound<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Haloalkyl ether compounds are usable as a starting material for an aromatic chloromethyl compound which is widely used as intermediates for medicals, dyes, ion-exchange resins, conductive agents, antistatic agents, etc. In recent years, haloalkyl ether compounds are usable as a starting material for a quaternary ammonium salt which is expected as an electrolyte for a electrochemical device such as a battery, capacitor, etc.<br>
As a method of preparing a haloalkyl ether compound, a method is conventionally known wherein an aldehyde, alchohol and hydrogen halide are reacted (nonpatent literature 1). However, this method entails many impurities such as aldehyde condensates, hyperreactants, etc., and has difficulty of obtaining a haloalkyl ether compound having high purity.  Particularly in preparing chloromethyl methyl ether, cancer-causing bischloromethyl ether is produced in a large amount as a by-product, giving problems in handling<br>
and disposal thereof.<br>
In order to solve the above problems, for example, it is known to react a compound of the formula (2) with a compound of the formula (3) with heat to prepare a haloalkyl ether compound of the formula (1) (nonpatent literature 2). Although by-products are formed in a small amount in this method, the reaction is conducted at a high temperature (55<br>
to 60° C) for a long period of time (18 hours). Thus, it is considered that a low-boiling starting material and highly toxic chloromethyl methyl ether (desired compound) will vaporize to burden the environment.<br>

More preferable are chloromethyl methyl ether and chloromethyl ethyl ether.<br>
Typical of process for preparing haloalkyl ether compound of the formula (1) is explained by the following reaction equation.<br>
 (1)<br>
The haloalkyl ether compound of the formula (1) can be prepared by reacting a compound of the formula (2) and a compound of the formula (3) in the presence of Lewis acid. The reaction is carried out without a solvent or in a suitable solvent. The solvent to be used can be a wide variety of known solvents insofar as they are capable of dissolving Lewis acid, the compounds of the formulas (2) and (3) and will not adversely affect the reaction.  Examples of such solvents are hexane, heptane, cyclohexane and like aliphatic hydrocarbons, dichloromethane, chloroform and like hydrocarbon halides, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone and like ketones, methyl acetate, ethyl acetate and like esters, toluene and like aromatic hydrocarbons, acetonitrile and like nitriles.<br>

most preferably 0.001 to 0.1 equivalent based on the compound of the formula (2).<br>
When a large quantity of Lewis acid is used, a slurry of the reactants becomes a high concentration, the reaction is difficult to be controlled and the product is difficult to be purified, causing an increased loss of the desired product. Further, upon distillation, boiling point elevation occurred which causes thermal decomposition of the desired product, decrease in yield and purity of the desired product, etc., hence unfavorable.<br>
The reaction is carried out usually at -10 to +50° C, preferably at 0 to 30° C, more preferably at 0 to 10° C, for 10 minutes to 200 hours, preferably for 10 minutes to 10 hours, more preferably 0.5 to 5 hours.<br>
The desired product obtained by the foregoing reaction can be readily isolated from the reaction mixture and purified by usual isolating and purifying means such as distillation, concentration, organic solvent extraction, centrifuging, washing, chromatography and recrystallization.<br>
