The user can control any of his appliances from his mobile phone. He can switch them<br>
4<br><br>
ON and OFF whenever he requires. This means that you will be able to control your house from any corner of the world.<br>
The system is deployed on a web server so that it can be accessed through Internet. The database is accessed and updated through the system. The Server Database uses Microsoft Access. It has two tables; one table stores the username, password, and the list of appliances and there current status (ON or OFF), the second table is for scheduling of the home appliance. The user registers on the website and provided with a unique user id and password. The user gives the list of devices in his house, which needs to be accessed by him constantly.<br>
The user access the website through his mobile phone. He then logs into the site using the username and password provided to him. He is then provided with a list of his home appliances and an option for making it ON or OFF and scheduling the device. He can do the required changes here. He can even monitor and change the status of the device, like; the user can change the speed of the fan through this. He can change the speed from the current speed to the required speed directly instead of going through steps.<br>
In case of fire (Heat Sensor) and burglar (IR Sensors) at home, the home owner will get the SMS, FAX, alert message on YAHOO, MSN, AIM, ICQ messenger instantly (using XML Web services).<br>
The system is also provided with a software where the user can control the home appliances using his voice from home using said software and voice recognition system doesn"t need to train the computer and it will recognize any voice hence its completely user friendly.<br>
Detail Description of Invention:<br>
Figure 1 shows the Architecture of the Web Control System and<br>
Fig 2 shows the flow chart of the Method of controlling the home Appliances.<br>
As shown in figure 1 the web control system is deployed on a web server so that it can be accessed through Internet. The database is accessed and updated through the system. The user registers on the website and provided with a unique user id and password. The user gives the list of devices such as TV<br>
5<br><br>
 Refrigerator, fan etc. in his house, which needs to be accessed by him constantly.<br>
On the home PC, which the user uses to control the appliances, one page runs continuously; this page is the page of website accessed through the Internet. This page reads the status of the device (whether ON or OFF) from server database and sends a query string to the local host page, which controls the computer. This page is refreshed continuously on every 5 seconds. This page uses port programming. When there is a request to perform some status change to the page then it sends a signal through the parallel port and the value of the register is input to the parallel port.<br>
The client computer must be installed with Microsoft .NET Framework. It should also have some web browser like Internet Explorer, Netscape, Mozzilla etc.<br>
The user access the website through his mobile phone. He then log into the site using the username and password provided to him. He is then provided with a list of his home appliances and an option for making it ON or OFF and scheduling the device. He can do the required changes there. He can even monitor and change the status of the device, like; the user can change the speed of the fan through this. He can change the current speed to the required speed directly instead of going through steps.<br>
A home page will be displayed after getting logged in from site. This home page consists of a combo box having list of all home appliances and other combo box having ON/OFF option. A button is provided to apply the changes. A hyperlink is provided to scheduling and Fan/motor control pages.<br>
The various Features of the Home automation and security system are discussed<br>
in detail<br>
i) Scheduling Feature :<br>
The user can also schedule the system for usage. In scheduling the user sets two times between which he wants the appliance to be ON. An example for scheduling would be the task of switching the water pump ON and OFF between two times everyday. The user can schedule the system such that the water pump switches ON at the time set by the user and switches OFF at the time set by the user automatically. Hence there will not be any problem of forgetting to switch it ON or OFF everyday.<br>
6<br><br>
ii) Security Features:<br>
The security system provided by this system sends an SMS (Short Messaging Service), FAX and instant alert message on YAHOO, MSN, ICQ messenger to the house owner whenever the security of his house is breached. The SMS will be sent in 0.32 seconds, the FAX will be sent in 0.26 seconds and instant alert message on YAHOO, MSN, ICQ, and AIM messenger will be sent in 0.28 seconds. The SMS or FAX can be sent to as many people as desired.<br>
The system detects the break of path of Infra Red rays of transmitter receiver which will be placed at suitable places at home and system send the SMS, FAX, alert message on YAHOO, MSN, ICQ, AIM messengers which is sent without using any mobile phone or FAX machine.<br>
a)	Fire Protection:<br>
Heat sensors have also been used which will detect fire in the house and send an SMS, FAX, alert message on YAHOO, MSN, ICQ, AIM messengers to the nearby fire station giving the address of the house and the time the fire was detected. An SMS and FAX will also be sent to the house owner regarding the accident. All these three (SMS, FAX, alert message) features have been kept just in a case one of them is not working the others will work.<br>
b)	Burglar Security Using Infrared Waves:<br>
An Infrared transmitter and receiver is used. The system (receiver plus transmitter) is embedded in near doors or windows or anywhere in home. Whenever there is an intruder the circuit is broken. The receiver sends a signal to the computer and the computer will send SMS, FAX, alert message on YAHOO, MSN, AIM, ICQ messengers; this will be sent using software designed in VS.NET.<br>
iii) Poor bell Response:<br>
If you want to leave any message for the visitors at the home in your absence then you just have to type the message in textbox of our software. This message will be played when the visitor presses the doorbell.<br>
7<br><br>
V) Voice Automation:<br>
A software is provided to user where he can control home appliances using his voice from home .The voice recognition system doesn"t need to train the computer and it will recognize any voice so its completely user friendly.<br>
There is provided a reduced the dictionary of the voice recognition machine so that it doesn"t compare your voice with million of words But it will compare voice with only predefined words from dictionary so thereby eliminating the wrong detection.<br>
