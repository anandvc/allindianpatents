SURFACTANT SYSTEM<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The invention relates to a surfactant system for use id aqueous composition 2nd more particularly to a surfactant system for use in, or addition to, aqueous enzyme based cleaning preparations.   The invention has particular advantage when employed in enzyme based cleaning preparations intended for use for cleaning medical instruments. BACKGROUND ART<br>
Any discussion of the prior art throughout the specification should in no way be considered as an admission that such prior art is widely known or forms part of common general knowledge in the field.<br>
The invention is herein described with particular reference to compositions for cleaning medical instruments, but is not limited to that use. As herein used the term "medical instruments" is intended broadly to include surgical  such as calpels, biopsy Instruments, clamps, and the likes; endoscopes, colonoscopes, laparoseepes and other paraphernalia used for surgical investigation or intcrvention; and other instruments used in the practice of medicine, surgery, and dentistry which require cleaning, disinfection or sterilisation. The term is also intended to include instruments having similar cleaning requirements such as those used in hairdressing, cosmetic treatments, tattooing, body piercing etc as well as offer applications where removal of human/animal sebum and/or body secretion is required.   Many medical instruments are<br><br>
wO 02/18530	PCT/AU01/01094<br>
-2-<br>
made from or incorporate a variety of construction materials and cleaning compositions must be such as not to attack any such materials.<br>
It is common practice to clean medical instruments after use with one patient and prior to treatment of another by scrubbing to remove blood, tissue, loose proteinatious and other soils, and then soaking for a predetermined period in an enzyme preparation adapted to further digest or loosen any proteinacious materials remaining on the instrument surface The instruments are then rinsed clean and subjected to further disinfection or sterilization procedures. To minimize the possibility of cross infection instruments used with one patient are desirably cleaned separately from those used with another.<br>
Preparations for use in cleaning medical instruments consist generally of a concentrate comprising one or more surfactants in combination with one or more proteolytic enzymes. The concentrate is diluted to a working strength (normally a hundredfold dilution) prior to use. One such formulation has been described by NOVO NORDISK ("Novo-formulation").-Three preparations used internationally for this purpose are EPIZYME ® a product of 3M, MEDIZYME ® (a product of Whiteley Industries Pty Ltd., Sydney Australia) and ENDOZYME ® (a product of Ruholf Corporation, NY, USA). While such products are generally effective and widely used there remains a need for prodncts which are more efficient, and especially for preparations which are capable of achieving a predetermined level of effectiveness within a shorter time than those currently available.<br>
The concentrate must be sufficiently stable in transit and storage prior to use to satisfy the needs of commerce. The choice of surfactants which in practice can be formulated in concentrated aqueous solutions is limited. Either the surfactants limit the storage stability of the concentrate, resulting in problems of foaming on dilution, provide insufficient reduction in surface tension, destabilize other components of the system such as enzymes, or suffer from other disadvantages. Mostly, formulators utilize surfactants chosen from a small group of conventional and well known nonionic surfactants which have been found to be satisfactory for such uses, but there remains an unsatisfied demand for formulations of improved efficiency.<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide an improved surfactant system and of preferred embodiments cf the invention TO Provide an crzyme based cleaning<br><br>
composition which avoids problems of the prior art and/or provides improved performance.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
An aqueous composition comprising composition being a surfactant system comprising an alkyl pyrrolidone and an alkyl polysaccharide in the ratio of 1:37.5 to 75:1 by weight.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to a first aspect the invention provides an aqueous composition comprising in combination an alkyl pyrrolidone and an alkyl polysaccharide.<br>
For preference the alkyl pyrrolidone is a C8-C18 linear alkyl pyrrolidone. N- dodecyl pyrrolidone ("N-DP") is highly preferred. Desirably, the alkyl polysaccharide is an alkyl polyglucoside ("APG")-<br>
According to a second aspect the invention provides a method of enhancing the efficacy of an enzyme containing composition for use in cleaning medical instruments comprising the step of including an alkyl pyrrolidone and an alkyl polysaccharide.<br>
Preferably the composition is a concentrate which contains surfactant according to the first aspect as part of its formulation, but the surfactant system can be added subsequently either to the concentrate or the working solution.<br>
According to a third aspect the invention provides a method of cleaning a medical instrument including the step of treating the instrument with a composition including at least one enzyme, an alkyl pyrrolidone and an alkyl polysaccharide.<br>
Unless the context clearly requires otherwise, throughout the description and the claims, the words 'comprise', 'comprising', and the like are to be construed in an inclusive sense as opposed to an exclusive or exhaustive sense; that is to say, in the sense of "including, but not limited to".<br>
Alkyl pyrrolidones are known to reduce surface tension progressively with increasing concentration in water achieving a minimum surface tension (maximum effectiveness) at a concentration of about 0.1% in the case of dodecyl pyrrolidone and about 0.002% in the case of octyl pyrrolidone, which concentrations correspond to the maximum solubility of the respective pyrrolidones in water. This has in the past inhibited their use in concentrates, since the maximum concentration in an aqueous system is inevitably less than fully effective as a surfactant when diluted to any substantial degree.<br>
BEST MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
An additive according to the invention consisting of n-dodecyl pyrrolidone ("n- DP") in combination with alkyl polyglucoside ("APG") was added to solutions prepared from each of three commercially available enzyme cleaning preparation concentrates.<br><br>
-4-<br>
ThesewereMEDIZYME®,ENDOZYME® and EPIZYME®. A fourth concentrate irNOVO formulation11, a product described by NOVO INDUSTRIES in Novo Nordisk Publications Application Sheet B-613, "Application of Enzymes in Detergents for Endoscope Cleaning", was also prepared and tested. In the tests described in Table 1 the additive consisted of 0.2%w/w n-dodecyl pyrrolidone ("n-DP") and 0.1%w/w of alkyl polyglucoside ("APG") in each case based on the weight of the concentrate.<br>
The NOVO Formulation (Concentrate) is as follows:<br><br>
Component	%w/w<br>
Non-ionic surfactant (Teric BL9)	12<br>
Propylene Glycol	22<br>
Triethanolamine	7<br>
Boric acid	4<br>

	The Epizyme composition (concentrate) is as follows:<br><br>
Component	%w/w<br>
Tap water	19.0<br>
Teric BL9 (non ionic Gurfactant)	10.0<br>
Preservative	0.15<br>
Enzyme stabilizer	6.0<br>

-5-<br>
By way of example the protease may be subtilisin, the amylase Alpha-amylase, the cellulase may be endo-1,4-beta-glucanase and the lipase may be Triacylglycerol. However, other enzymes or combinations of enzymes may be substituted for these.<br>
Each of the cleaning composition concentrates were diluted at a rate of 1 part of concentrate in 100 parts of standard hard water (0.304 g calcium chloride and 0.065g of magnesium chloride per 1L of distilled water. Therapeutic Goods Order 54 &amp; Guidelines, 1996, p. 17). The efficacy of each product was then tested against standard soil preparations on glass slides, (1) neat and (2) with, the addition of an additive according to the invention. The efficiency of the preparation (time required to achieve a given score) was measured at various temperatures. The results are shown in Table 1 in comparison with results of compositions including the additive according to the invention.<br>
Accelerated aging tests are summarized in Table 2, Details of the preparation of standard soils is given in table 3.and "Method  forAscertaining the Cleaning Performance ofDishwasherDetergents"(SOPW Journal 126. Jahrgaog 3-2000)<br>

Addition rate: 0.2 w/w% N-DP and 0.1 w/w% APG to concentrate<br>
Dilution rate: 1 part of concentrate in 100 parts of standard hard water<br>
As is evident from Table 1, the addition of the additive reduces the time required for the composition to achieve a given score and does so at each temperature. The additive is especially effective at lower temperatures.<br>
Although the results shown in Table 1 were obtained using 0,2 w/w% N-DP and 0. lw/w% APG to concentrate, the ratio of N-DP to APG can be varied. It is preferred that the ratio be between 1 part by weight of alkyl pyrrolidone to 3 parts by weight of alkyl polyglucoside and 3 parts by weight of aDcyl pyrrolidone to 1 part by weight of alkyl polyglucoside, more preferably between 3 parts by weight of alkyl pyrrolidone to 1 parts by weight of alky! polyglucoside and 1 part by weight of alkyl pyrrolidonc to 1 pan.<br><br><br>
WO 02/18530	<br><br>
PCT/AU01/01094<br><br>
-7-<br>
The concentration of N-DP and APG is each preferably less than 7.5% w/w of the concentrate (ie less than about .0075%in the concentrate at dilution of lpart concentrate: 100 parts water) and more preferably is less than 3% w/w. The actual concentrations employed will depend on the surface tension properties required, the . hydrophilicity of the alkyl polyglucosides and the degree of hydrotroping provided by other excipients in the formulation to the alkyl polyglucoside, as well as other factors which may occur with respect to individual formulations.<br>
Table 2 shows the effect of the additive in accelerated aging tests. The results demonstrate that the additive slightly improves storage stability, or, at least, does not adversely affect it.<br>

Assessed using B 863b test method by NOVO NORDISK (attached herewith as Annexure 1) The additive according to the invention and dilution were as for table 1.<br>
Table 3 shows the effects of varying the concentration and ratio of the alkylpyrrolidone and alkylpolyglucoside. It can be seen that the composition is efficacious in reducing contact times for cleaning over a wide range of alkylpyrroline alkylpolyglucoside ratios.<br><br>

The beef gelatin and water were blended together and heated until the mixture obtained a homogenous consistency. Cholesterol, hog mucin and egg yolk werE bleNded ID. after gelatin was cooled to 30C. 0.1 g of soil was deposited onto surfaces of the microscope slides. The smears were made of a uniform thickness for each sat of slides; the thickness was regulated by a border of adhesive tape along each border of the smearing instrument In order to simulate the conditions of an endoscope cleaning, the slides were left to dry in open air at 20°C for 20 minutes.<br>
"Without wishing to be  bound by theory, the polysaccharide appears to stabilize the pyrrolidone, the combination being more soluble in the concentrate and resulting in substantially improved lowering of surface tension at the working dilution.<br><br>

Although the test results utilize n-dodecyl pyrrolidone, other alkyl pyrroUdones could be substituted therefore, and especially C8 to C18 alkyl pyrroUdones. The amount to be added can be determined by simple trial but in general increasing the concentration significantly above the levels herein employed tends to give a decreasing advantage. Similarly, other alkyl polysaccharides may be substituted for APG. For example other sugar units and derivatives of sugar units may be substituted for glucose units. Again there is an optimum concentration beyond which increasing the concentration is of relatively little benefit. While the combination of n-alkyl pyrrolidone with APG is highly preferred, beneficial effects are obtainable with at least some soils by adding it in isolation. The optimum ratio of n-DP to APG can be determined by simple trial for a given concentrate.<br>
The combination of the invention provides an improved surfactant system which is expected to have application in many end-uses.   In the field of cleaners for medical instruments, the surfactant system of the invention may be simply added to commercially available enzyme cleaning products either to the concentrate or, at an appropriate dilution to the working solution prior to use. Preferably however the additives are incorporated into a concentrate at the time of manufacture of the concentrate which is then merely diluted prior to use.<br>
Additives according to the invention may be added to dishwashing, hand washing and other surface cleaning compositions.<br>
Embodiments of the invention may be altered and may have other chemicals added or substituted therefore to an extent which will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the teaching hereof without departing from the inventive concept herein disclosed.<br><br>

If it is desired to know the exact activity levels of proteinase in a detergent the detergent bases should be included in the standard solutions unless it is already known that the particular formulation being used has no effect on the protease activity. The concentration of the base detergent should be equal to that used in the sample solution of the detergent containing protease.<br>
The presence in solution of strong chelators such as NTA or EDTA may result in deactivation of the protease over the time period required for preparation of the various materials for the assay. This cause of deactivation can be overcome by adding excess calcium to the sample solutions.<br>
