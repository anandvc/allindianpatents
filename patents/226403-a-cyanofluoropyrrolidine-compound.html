For example, in a case where Rb is a tert-butoxycarbonyl group, a benzyloxycarbonyl group, a fluorenylcarbonyl group, a trityl group, an o-nltrobenzenesulfenyl group or the like, such a protecting group may be Introduced using, e.g., di-tert-butyl dicarbonate, benzyloxycarbonyl chloride, fluorenylcarbonyl chloride, trityl chloride or o-nitrobenzenesulfenyl chloride in a single or mixed solvent such as dichloromethane, chloroform, 1,2-dichloroethane, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, toluene, ethyl acetate and/or water. The reaction may be performed at -SO'C to 100°C. In this case, the reaction may be performed using an appropriate base; and examples of a base include amines (e.g., triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine), organic acid salts (e.g., sodium 2-ethylhexanoate, potassium 2-ethylhexanoate) or inorganic bases (e.g., sodium hydroxide, potassium carbonate).<br>
For example, in the case of Compound (X) wherein R^ represents the formula -N(R*)C0R\ -N(R*)S02R^ or -NRV, this compound can be prepared by combining the procedures described in Step (1-5) or (1-6) of Scheme 1.<br>
Compound (X) [Scheme 3]<br><br>
(Xll)	(X)<br>
{wherein R^, R^ and X are as defined above, R^ represents the formula -CH=CH-R' or -CBC-R' or an optionally substituted heteroaryl group among those listed above, and R' is as defined above}<br>
This step starts with a cyano form (XII) to obtain an amine form (X).<br>
For example, in a case where R^ and R^ are each a methyl group, the amine form (X) can be obtained from the cyano form (XII) using, e.g., methylmagnesium bromide or methyllithium. In this case, anhydrous cerium chloride or the like may be added. Examples of a solvent available for use in this reaction include dichloromethane, chloroform, 1,2-dichloroethane, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, toluene, and diethyl ether. The reaction may be performed at -78°C to 100°C.<br>

Anhydrous cerium chloride (5.0 g) was suspended in tetrahydrofuran (40 mL) and stirred overnight at room temperature. While cooling with dry ice and acetone, methyllithium (1.2 M in diethyl ether, 16.3 mL) was slowly added dropwise to the suspension, followed by stirring for 30 minutes. To this reaction system, a solution of 3-cyanothiophene (710 mg) in tetrahydrofuran (1.0 mL) was added dropwise at the same temperature. The reaction mixture was further stirred while gradually warming to room temperature over 5 hours. While stirring the reaction mixture under ice cooling, 25% aqueous ammonia (12.5 mL) was added dropwise. The suspension was filtered through celite and the resulting filtrate was extracted with diethyl ether (25 mL). The extracted solution was washed with saturated aqueous sodium chloride (20 mL), dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered to remove the desiccant and then concentrated under reduced pressure to give the titled compound (203 mg) as a black liquid.<br>

Test Example 1 [Dipeptidyl peptidase IV activity inhibition test]<br>
The inhibition test of dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) activity was performed as described in Diabetes, 47, 764-769, 1998. Plasma containing dipeptidyl peptidase IV was prepared from the blood of healthy volunteers by centrifugation. The enzymatic reaction was performed using a 96-well flat-bottomed plate in a buffer composed of 25 mM HEPES, 140 mM NaCl and 1% BSA, pH 7.8. A 100 \M  solution of Gly-Pro-4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide (25 \il,   a product of Peptide Institute, Inc., Japan), a 133 mM solution of magnesium chloride (7.5 jil) and a test compound (5 |il) were mixed and then supplemented with the plasma (12.5 |xl) which had been diluted to 1/100 with the above buffer. After reaction at room temperature for 2 hours, a 25% aqueous<br><br>
acetic acid solution (50 ^1) was added to stop the reaction. The amount of the liberated 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin was measured as fluorescence intensity at 460 nm using a fluorescence plate reader (1420 ARVO™ Multilabel Counter; Wallac) with an excitation wavelength of 390 nm. The fluorescence intensity obtained for vehicle addition (reaction time: 0 min) was used as a blank value and subtracted from each measured value to obtain the specific fluorescence intensity. The resulting specific fluorescence intensity was used to calculate the % inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase IV activity according to the following equation. Each test compound was prepared as a 1000-fold concentrated solution in dimethyl sulfoxide and diluted with the above buffer before use. A concentration required for each test compound to produce 50% inhibition (IC50) was calculated from % inhibition data at the respective concentrations.<br>
Inhibition (%) = A/B x 100 where<br>
A = (fluorescence intensity in the presence of vehicle)-(fluorescence intensity in the presence of test compound)<br>
B = fluorescence intensity in the presence of vehicle<br>

Test Example 2 [Measurement test on DPPIV activity in rat plasma when administered orally]<br>
Male SD(IGS) rats at 8 weeks of age (Charles River Japan, Inc.) were used for this test. A test compound was dissolved at a concentration of 0.2 mg/mL with water for injection under Japanese Pharmacopoeia (Hikari Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Japan) and administered orally in a volume of 5 mL/kg (at a dose of 1 mg/kg). Blood samples were collected over time from the orbital vein using heparin-treated blood collection tubes (Drummond Scientific Company) under diethyl ether anesthesia before and after administration of the test compound. Each blood sample was centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 15 minutes at 4°C to collect a plasma fraction. The resulting plasma fractions were stored at -80°C. It should be noted that the rats were fasted from 16 hours before and until 6 hours after administration of the test compound, but allowed to drink sterile water without any restriction.<br>
DPPIV activity in plasma was determined as follows.<br>
The enzymatic reaction was performed using a 96-well plate in a buffer composed of 25 mM HEPES, 140 mM NaCl and 1% BSA, pH 7.8. As a substrate solution, 10 mM H-Gly-Pro-4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide (BACHEM) was diluted to 1/100 with the buffer. A reaction solution was prepared in advance to have the following composition per well: 100 ^M substrate solution (25 JAL), buffer (5 ^L) and 133 mM magnesium chloride (7.5 fxL).<br>
The plasma samples were dispensed at 12.5 \xL  per well<br><br>
and supplemented with the reaction solution (37.5 \iL)   to start the enzymatic reaction. After reaction at room temperature for 5 minutes, a 25% aqueous acetic acid solution (50 \KL)  was added to stop the reaction. The amount of the liberated 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin was measured as fluorescence Intensity at 460 nm using a fluorescence plate reader (1420 ARVO™ Multilabel Counter; Wallac) with an excitation wavelength of 390 nm. The rat plasma collected before administration of the test compound (pooled from all rats) was pre-treated with a 25% aqueous acetic acid solution to deactivate the enzyme activity and then supplemented with the reaction solution, followed by determining the fluorescence intensity. The fluorescence intensity thus determined was used as a blank value and subtracted from each measured value to obtain the specific fluorescence intensity. The amount of the produced 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (nmol, hereinafter referred to as AMC) was calculated from a calibration curve prepared with standards. Assuming that the amount of AMC production before administration of the test compound was set to 100%, DPPIV activity was expressed as follows.<br>
DPPIV activity (% of Control) = A/B x 100 where<br>
A = amount of AMC production after administration of test compound<br>
B = amount of AMC production before administration of test compound<br><br>
The results obtained are shown in Table A. The compound of the present invention was confirmed to ensure prolonged inhibition of DPPIV activity when administered orally to rats at a dose of 1 mg/kg.<br>
