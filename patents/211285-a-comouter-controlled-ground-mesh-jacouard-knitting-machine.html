				<td>COMPUTER CONTROLLED GROUND MESH<br>
JACQUARD KNITTING MACHINE<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a computer-<br>
controlled ground mesh jacquard knitting machine, and<br>
more particularly to such a computer-controlled ground<br>
mesh jacquard knitting machine in which each yarn feeder<br>
has a recessed portion for receiving a corresponding color<br>
changing head.<br>
Most knitting machine manufacturers try hard to<br>
improve jacquard knitting techniques, so as to knit out<br>
versatile jacquard fabrics. In order to produce a colorful<br>
jacquard pattern, color changing heads are installed to<br>
provide different color yarns. When color changing<br>
heads are used, the yarn feeders must be removed from the<br>
jacquard knitting machine. If the color changing heads<br>
are directly installed in the jacquard knitting machine<br>
without removing the yarn feeders, the yard feeders will<br>
be damaged by the yarn changing board at each color<br>
changing head.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention has been accomplished to<br>
provide a computer-controlled ground mesh jacquard<br>
knitting machine, which eliminates the aforesaid problem.<br>
According to the present invention, the yarn feeders each<br>
have a recessed portion. When color changing heads are installed, they are<br>
respectively received in the recessed portion at each yarn feeder. Therefore, the<br>
yarn feeders and the color changing heads can be concomitantly installed in the<br>
jacquard knitting machine without causing any trouble.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a computer-controlled ground<br>
mesh jacquard knitting machine comprising : a set of yarn feeders, said yarn<br>
feeders each comprising a recessed portion corresponding to color changing<br>
heads of the jacquard knitting machine ; a set of needles mounted on a needle<br>
cylinder in the jacquard knitting machine ; a set of first needle jacks respectively<br>
coupled to said needles at a bottom side ; a set of second needle jacks<br>
respectively coupled to said first needle jacks at a bottom side; lifting cam means<br>
controlled to lift said needles and said first needle jacks, said lifting cam means<br>
comprising an outer track and an inner track, said outer track comprising needle<br>
lifting guide blocks, flat guide blocks and needle descending guide blocks<br>
respectively provided in order, said inner track comprising needle lifting guide<br>
blocks ; and a needle selector mounted below said lifting cam means ; wherein<br>
said lifting cam means is driven to move said needles and said first needle jacks,<br>
and said needle selector is controlled to selectively drive said second needle<br>
jacks, causing the corresponding first needle jacks to be moved away from the<br>
descending guide blocks in said inner track, so as to achieve a ground mesh<br>
jacquard knitting effect.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Referring to Figures from 1A through 1D, a computer-controlled ground<br>
mesh jacquard knitting<br>
machine is shown comprised of a set of yarn feeders 1<br>
supported on the machine base (not shown) thereof, a set<br>
of needles 2 mounted in the needle cylinder (not shown), a<br>
set of first needle jacks 4 respectively coupled to the<br>
needles 2 at the bottom side, a set of second needle jacks 5<br>
respectively coupled to the first needle jacks 4 at the<br>
bottom side, pairs of lifting cams 3 and 3" controlled to<br>
lift the first needle jacks 4 and the needles 2, and a needle<br>
selector 6 mounted in a cap (not shown) and controlled to<br>
selectively lift the second needle jacks 5.<br>
The yarn feeders 1 each comprise a thread hole 11<br>
or 12 through which a ground yarn 7 or face yarn 8 is<br>
inserted, a recessed portion 13, and a ceramic hole 14.<br>
The needles 2 each comprise a needle heel 21, and a<br>
coupling portion 22 adjacent to the needle heel 21. The<br>
first needle jacks 4 each comprise a butt 41, and a front<br>
coupling portion 42 coupled to the coupling portion 22 at<br>
one of the needles 2. The second needle jacks 5 each<br>
comprise a butt 51, and a front receptacle 52, which<br>
receives the rear end of one of the first needle jacks 4.<br>
The pairs of lifting cams 3 and 3" each include a first<br>
lifting cam 3 and a second lifting cam V. The first<br>
lifting cam 3 comprises an outer track 31, an inner track<br>
32, a first projecting block 31a in the outer track 31, and a<br>
second projecting block 32a in the inner track 32. The<br>
second lifting cam 3" comprises an outer track 31", an<br>
inner track 32", a first projecting block 31a" and a second<br>
projecting block 31b" in the outer track 31", and a third<br>
projecting block 32a" in the inner track 32.<br>
The needle selector 6 is controlled by an external<br>
computer, comprising a plurality of selection jacks 61<br>
corresponding to the second needle jacks 5. The<br>
selection jacks 61 are selectively moved between a<br>
horizontal position and a vertical position. When one<br>
selection jack 61 is moved to the horizontal position, it is<br>
stopped below the butt 51 at the corresponding second<br>
needle jack 5, for enabling the corresponding second<br>
needle jack 5 to be moved to lift the corresponding first<br>
needle jack 4 and the corresponding needle 2.<br>
Referring to Figure 2, the recessed portion 13 at<br>
each of the yarn feeders 1 is provided to receive<br>
corresponding color changing heads 15 of a color<br>
changing unit of the computer-controlled ground mesh<br>
jacquard knitting machine, therefore the yard feeders 1 do<br>
not hinder the color changing heads 15. Further, the<br>
ceramic hole 14 is provided at the bottom end of the<br>
recessed portion 13. When using the computer-<br>
controlled ground mesh jacquard knitting machine to knit<br>
an elastic fabric, elastic yarn can be arranged in the<br>
ceramic hole 14.<br>
Referring to Figures 3A and 3B, the lifting cams 3<br>
and 3" are rotated by the knitting machine, the needle heel<br>
21 of each needle 2 and the butt 41 of each first needle<br>
jack 4 are respectively moved in the outer track 31 and<br>
inner track 32 at one first lifting cam 3, and the needle<br>
heel 21 of each needle 2 is moved over the left slope of<br>
the second projecting block 32a at the corresponding first<br>
lifting cam 3, thereby causing the needle 2 to be lifted.<br>
Thereafter, each needle 2 is lowered along the first<br>
projecting block 31a in the at the corresponding first<br>
lifting cam 3 to take a ground yarn 7. Then, the needle<br>
heel 21 of each needle 2 and the butt 41 of each first<br>
needle jack 4 are respectively moved in the outer track 31"<br>
and inner track 32" at one second lifting cam 3", and the<br>
needle heel 21 of each needle 2 is moved over the left<br>
slope of the third projecting block 32a" at the<br>
corresponding second lifting cam 3", thereby causing the<br>
needle 2 to be lifted, and then the needle 2 is moved along<br>
the second projecting block 31b" in the outer track 31" at<br>
the corresponding second lifting cam 3" to achieve part A<br>
shown in Figure 6.<br>
Referring to Figures 4A and 4B, after passing<br>
through the corresponding first lifting cam 3, the needle<br>
heel 21 of each needle 2 and the butt 41 of each first<br>
needle jack 4 are respectively moved in the outer track 31"<br>
and inner track 32" at one second lifting cam 3". When<br>
each needle 2 is moved along the first projecting block<br>
31a" at one second lifting cam 3", the selection jacks 61 of<br>
the needle selector 6 are at the needle section status, and<br>
selected selection jacks 61 are respectively stopped at the<br>
butt 51 of each of the second needle jacks 5 to lift the<br>
second needle jacks 5 and the first needle jacks 4, and<br>
therefore the butt 41 of each of the first needle jacks 4 is<br>
respectively spaced above the third projecting block 32a"<br>
at each of the second lifting cams 3", i.e., each needle 2 is<br>
moved through the outer side of the corresponding third<br>
projecting block 32a" and then lowered along the<br>
corresponding second projecting block 31b" to complete<br>
an idle knitting stroke, i.e., to achieve a ground mesh<br>
jacquard knitting (see part B shown in Figure 6).<br>
Referring to Figures 5A and 5B, when the needle<br>
heel 21 of each needle 2 and the butt 41 of each first<br>
needle jack 4 are respectively moved in the outer track 31<br>
and inner track 32 at one first lifting cam 3, and the needle<br>
heel 21 of each needle 2 is moved over the left slope of<br>
the second projecting block 32a at the corresponding first<br>
lifting cam 3, each needle 2 is lifted, and then moved<br>
toward the first projecting block 31a at the corresponding<br>
first lifting cam 3. When the needle heel 21 of one<br>
needle 2 is lifted to the flat surface portion of the<br>
corresponding first projecting block 31a and the<br>
corresponding selection jack 61 is selected, the butt 51 of<br>
the corresponding needle jack 5 is pushed upwards by the<br>
corresponding selection jack 6, thereby causing the<br>
corresponding first needle jack 4 to be lifted from the<br>
second projecting block 32a, therefore the needle 2 is<br>
moved through the outer side of the corresponding second<br>
projecting block 32a, and thereafter, the needle 2 is<br>
lowered along the corresponding first projecting block<br>
31a to take a ground yarn 7, and then the needle heel 21 of<br>
the needle 2 and the butt 41 of the corresponding first<br>
needle jack 4 are respectively moved in the outer track 31"<br>
and inner track 32" at the corresponding second lifting<br>
cam 3", and the needle heel 21 of each needle 2 is moved<br>
over the left slope of the third projecting block 32a" at the<br>
corresponding second lifting cam 3", thereby causing the<br>
needle 2 to be lifted, and then the needle 2 is lowered<br>
along the second projecting block 31b" in the outer track<br>
31" at the corresponding second lifting cam 3" to take a<br>
face yarn 8, so as to achieve part C shown in Figure 6.<br>
