JP-A-98-46067 discloses a coating composition comprising<br>

US 4,532,177 discloses a base coat composition comprising a film-forming resin selected from, among others, a polyester and an acrylic, blended with a cellulose ester material and a pigment.<br>
The present invention pertains to a solvent based coating composition comprising<br><br>
A)	at least one toner base comprising an acrylic polyol, a cellulose resin, a polyester polyol, and a pigment,<br>
B)	at least one connector base comprising at least one resin compatible with the resins mentioned in toner base A), and<br>
C)	at least one reducer base free of resins and pigments.<br>
It has been found that the coating composition of the present invention does not have drawbacks such as insufficient hiding, a high sensitivity for cloudiness, and a loss of brightness or colour. Such drawbacks are often found in base coat compositions. Furthermore, the coating composition of the present invention provides a very flexible application window. Due to a selection of resins, additives, and/or fillers to be used in the connector base (B), the use and properties of the coating composition of the present invention can be modified. For example, an interior coating with excellent properties such as gloss level and scratch resistance may be prepared from the coating composition of the present invention.<br>
The compatible resin which is used in the connector base (B) is preferably selected from an acrylic polyol, a cellulose resin, a polyester polyol, a polyurethane polyol, a vinyl resin, a polyisocyanate, and/or mixtures thereof.<br>
Also preferred is that toner base (A) and connector base (B) together comprise<br>
the following resins;<br>
10-40 wt.% on solids of cellulose resin,<br>
25 - 60 wt.% on solids of acrylic polyol,<br>
15-45 wt.% on solids of polyester polyol, and<br>
0-20 wt.% on solids of a compatible resin,<br>
the sum of the wt.% indicated for the resins always being 100 wt.%.<br>
Preferably, the resins are divided over toner base (A) and connector base (B) whereby toner base (A) comprises at least 25 wt.% on solids of resins and connector base (B) comprises at most 75 wt.% on solids of resins. More<br><br>
preferably, toner base (A) comprises 25 to 95 wt.% on solids of resins and connector base (B) comprises 5 to 75 wt.% on solids of resins. Most preferably, toner base (A) comprises 50 to 90 wt.% on solids of resins and connector base (B) comprises 10 to 50 wt.% on solids of resins.<br>
In a preferred embodiment both toner base (A) and connector base (B) comprise the same type of resins. Alternatively, both toner base (A) and connector base (B) may comprise the same resins. In a more preferred embodiment thereof, the resins in toner base (A) and connector base (B) are used in the same ratio. Thus a base coat composition with excellent coating properties can be prepared.<br>
Alternatively, by using different resins in the connector base (B) coating compositions having different properties can be prepared. The presence of a cellulose resin within connector base (B) provides a base coat composition according to the invention with a fast drying time. Such a base coat can then be advantageously used in striping or decoration.<br>
The presence of a polyester polyol in the connector base (B) will result in a more sluggish yet much more flexible base coat composition for plastic surfaces.<br>
It is also possible to provide a connector base (B) comprising additives, such as wax, and fillers, such as fumed silica, to provide a low gloss coating composition to be used as an interior coating composition. However, in a base coat application it is preferred that the connector base (B) is pigment free.<br>
The presence of a polyol in the toner base (A) and/ or the connector base (B) provides the possibility to chemically cross-link the coating composition. For example, a polyol can be cross-linked with an isocyanate hardener, resulting in a simple 2K system for door jams and inside (under the hood) use. To this end,<br><br>
the base coat composition may comprise a cross-linker base (D). Preferably, the cross-linker base (D) comprises an isocyanate hardener.<br>

In this particular embodiment, the coating composition can be applied over existing and new interior automotive parts. The substrates include ABS, RIM, polycarbonate, and polyolefin type plastic parts. It is not required to coat the interior coating with a clear coat.<br>
The invention will be further described in the following examples, which must not be construed as limiting the scope of the present invention in any way.<br><br>
Examples<br>
Unless otherwise stated, the properties of the coating compositions and the resulting films are measured as follows.<br>
The viscosity was measured in a DIN flow cup number 4 in accordance with DIN 53221-1987. The viscosity is given in seconds.<br>
Visual assessment was made of mottling, Benard cells, and EHO (Enamel Hold Out) on a scale of 1 to 10 (1= very bad, 10 = excellent).<br>
In a freshly applied, drying coating, pigment particles may be carried selectively towards the surface by drying currents. If the drying currents are uneven, the dry coating will show floating. In metallics, floating effects may disorient anisotropic aluminium flake pigments. For the resulting visual effect, which may be quite severe when compared with normal floating effects, the term mottling is used.<br>
If the drying currents are uneven, the dry coating can also become organized in Benard cells. Except that the overall colour of the surface is different from the bulk colour, Benard cells patterns, or other irregular drying effects, will be visible as local colour differences.<br>
The Enamel Hold Out (EHO) was determined as the total visual appearance. Each sample is rated for visual appearance on a scale of 1 to 10 (1= very bad appearance, 10 = excellent appearance) by a panel of at least 3 people. The determination takes into account gloss, wrinkling, flow and image clarity/-distinctness of image. The average number will give the EHO.<br>
Intercoat adhesion is the adhesion between the base coat and the clear coat. The adhesion was tested using the so called pull-off test, in which a cross-cut at 45° is made with an Olfa® cutter, after which a standard type adhesion tape is<br><br>
stuck on the paint and gently pulled off again. The values 1 - lu represem a scale for evaluation of the adhesion ranging from very poor adhesion (1) to excellent adhesion (10).<br>
Adhesion was measured in accordance with the standard ISO 2409 (1992). A rectangular lattice pattern, reaching down to the substrate, is cut into the coating to be tested. After cutting, detached particles are removed by brushing or by pulling-off with adhesion tape. The area of detachment of the coating is scored on a 0 -10 visual scale.<br>
Long wave and short wave readings were made using a wave scan apparatus (Byk).<br>
Gloss was measured in accordance with ISO 2813:1994 (angle 60°). The gloss is expressed in GU.<br>
Flexibility was measured in accordance with GM 9503 P.<br>
The chemical resistance of the coating was determined by the number of double rubs (1 double rub is 1 to-and-fro movement) needed to rub the coating through to the substrate. The number of double rubs is recorded. If the number of double rubs increases above 100, it-is recorded as 100+.<br>
Accelerated weathering was carried out with a Xenon-Arc Weatherometer in accordance with ISO 11341 (1994).<br>

Example 1 and Comparative example A<br>
Two blue metallic base coat compositions were prepared. The ratio of blue pigment, Heliogen Blue L7101 F, to metallic pigment, Sparkle Silver E5000AR, was 0.3. The pigments were added to›the resin composition of toner base A. The pigment/resin ratio was 0.27. The following resin combinations (wt.% on solid resin) were tested.<br><br><br><br>
Toner and connector bases A and B were mixed 1:1. Then the base coat compositions were set to a 18" DinC4 viscosity by adding the Reducer base C comprising conventional solvents.<br>
Two panels pretreated with Autocryl Filler 3110 ex Akzo Nobel Coatings BV (wet-on-wet version) were sanded and sprayed with the above-mentioned base coats. A clear coat was sprayed wet-on-wet on the base coats prepared from Autoclear MS 2000: Hardener MS 30:1.2.3 Slow ex Akzo Nobel Coatings BV in a ratio of 100:50:10. The coated panels were dried for 24 hours at ambient temperature and then aged overnight at 6O°C. The resulting coating properties are listed below.<br><br>
As can be seen from the results above, a base coat composition requires a toner base A comprising an acrylic polyol, a cellulose resin, and a polyester polyol.<br><br>
Examples 2-4 and Comparative example b Toner base A<br><br>
The base coat composition was prepared by mixing Toner base A and Connector base B in a weight ratio of 77:23. Subsequently, the mixture of A and B was mixed with Reducer base C containing conventional solvents in a volume ratio of 2:1.<br>
The base coat compositions were sprayed on car door panels, pretreated with Autocryl Filler 3110 ex Akzo Nobel Coatings BV, and a clear coat was sprayed wet-on-wet on the base coats prepared from Autoclear MS 2000: Hardener MS 30: 1.2.3 Slow ex Akzo Nobel Coatings BV in a ratio of 100:50:10. The coated<br><br>
panels were dried for 30 minutes at 6O°C. For comparison, Example 2 was repeated, except that a commercial solvent based base coat was used, Autobase ex Akzo Nobel Coatings BV in a similar metallic colour (Comparative example B). The results of the evaluation of the coatings are listed below. All properties score on a 0 -10 visual scale.<br><br><br><br>

As can be seen from the results, the coating composition of the present invention provides a very flexible application window due to the compatibility of the resins used. The properties of the resulting coatings are excellent.<br>
Examples 10-14<br>
Examples 5 to 9 were repeated, except that in addition to Toner, Connector, and Reducer bases A, B, and C, a cross-linker base D was added in an amount of 10 wt.% on the total composition of A, B, and C. The cross-linker base comprises 65 wt.% of the isocyanurate of hexane diisocyanate. Properties of the interior coatings are listed below.<br>
