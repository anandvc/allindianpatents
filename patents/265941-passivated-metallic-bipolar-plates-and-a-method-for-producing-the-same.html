PRODUCING THE SAME<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]	The field to which the disclosure generally relates includes fuel<br>
cells, fuel cell components, and methods of making and using the same.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002]	A fuel cell is an electro-chemical device that includes an anode and<br>
a cathode with an electrolyte therebetween. The anode receives hydrogen-rich<br>
gas or pure hydrogen and the cathode receives oxygen or air. The hydrogen gas<br>
is dissociated in the anode to generate free protons and electrons. The protons<br>
pass through the electrolyte to the cathode. The protons react with the oxygen<br>
and the electrons in the cathode to generate water. The electrons from the<br>
anode cannot pass through the electrolyte, and thus are directed through a load<br>
to perform work before being sent to the cathode. The work may be used to<br>
operate a vehicle, for example.<br>
[0003]	Proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells are popular for<br>
vehicle applications. The PEM fuel cell generally includes a solid-polymer-<br>
electrolyte proton-conducting membrane, such as a perfluorosulfonic acid<br>
membrane. The anode and cathode typically include finely divided catalytic<br>
particles, usually platinum ;Pt), supported on carbon particles and mixed with an<br>
ionomer. The catalytic mixture is deposited on opposing sides of the membrane.<br><br>
The combination of the anode catalytic mixture, the cathode catalytic mixture,<br>
and the membrane define a membrane electrode assembly (MEA). MEAs are<br>
relatively expensive to manufacture and require certain conditions for effective<br>
operation. These conditions include proper water management and<br>
humidification, and control of catalyst poisoning constituents, such as carbon<br>
monoxide (CO).<br>
[0004]	Several fuel cells are typically combined in a fuel cell stack to<br>
generate the desired power. The fuel cell stack includes a series of flow field or<br>
bipolar plates positioned between the several MEAs in the stack. The bipolar<br>
plates include an anode side and a cathode side for adjacent fuel cells in the<br>
stack. The fuel cell stack receives an anode hydrogen reactant gas that flows<br>
into the anode side of the stack. Anode gas flow channels are provided on the<br>
anode side of the bipolar plates that allow the anode gas to flow to the anode<br>
side of the MEA. The fuel cell stack receives a cathode reactant gas, typically a<br>
flow of air forced through the stack by a compressor. Cathode gas flow channels<br>
are provided on the cathode side of the bipolar plates that allow the cathode gas<br>
to flow to the cathode side of the MEA. Not all of the oxygen is consumed by the<br>
stack and some of the air is output as a cathode exhaust gas that may include<br>
liquid water as a stack by-product. The bipolar plates may also include flow<br>
channels for a cooling fluid. An automotive fuel cell stack, for example, may<br>
include about two hundred or more bipolar plates.<br>
[0005]	The bipolar plates are typically made of a conductive material so<br>
that they conduct the electricity generated by the fuel cells from one cell to the<br><br>
next cell and out of the stack. Metal bipolar plates may produce a natural oxide<br>
on their outer surface that may make them resistant to corrosion. However, this<br>
oxide layer is not conductive, and thus increases the internal resistance of the<br>
fuel cell, reducing its electrical performance.<br>
SUMMARY OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0006]	One embodiment of the invention includes a I including<br>
providing a fuel cell substrate; treating the substrate to form a passive layer,<br>
wherein the passive layer has a thickness of at least 3 nm; and depositing an<br>
electrically conductive coating over the substrate, wherein the coating has a<br>
thickness of about 0.1 nm to about 50 nm.<br>
[0007]	Other exemplary embodiments of the invention will become<br>
apparent from the detailed description provided hereinafter. It should be<br>
understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while disclosing<br>
exemplary embodiments of the invention, are intended for purposes of illustration<br>
only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0008]	Exemplary embodiments of the present invention will become more<br>
fully understood from the detailed description and the accompanying drawings,<br>
wherein:<br>
[0009]	FIG. 1 illustrates a process according to one embodiment of the<br>
invention.<br><br>
[0010]	FIG, 2 illustrates a process according to one embodiment of the<br>
invention.<br>
[0011]	FIG. 3 illustrates a product according to one embodiment of the<br>
invention.<br>
[0012 ]	FIG. 4 is a graph illustrating cell voltage and high frequency<br>
resistance (HFR) versus current density.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0013]	The following description of the embodiment(s) is merely exemplary<br>
in nature and is in no way intended to limit the invention, its application, or uses.<br>
[0014]	Referring to FIG. 1, in one embodiment a fuel cell substrate 10 is<br>
provided. The substrate may comprise at least one of stainless steel, titanium,<br>
aluminum, or nickel base alloy. The substrate 10 may be treated to form a<br>
passive layer 12. The treating of the substrate 10 may include at least one of<br>
contacting the substrate with a nitric acid solution, applying to the substrate a<br>
heat treatment above 400°C, or soaking the substrate in boiling de-ionized water.<br>
In one embodiment, the applying the to the substrate a heat treatment may<br>
include placing the substrate in an oven set above 400°C, for example 450°C. In<br>
one embodiment, the treating of the substrate 10 may remove any residua! iron<br>
that resulted from mechanical treatments of the substrate, for example when the<br>
substrate is stainless steel. The passive layer 12 may be a passive oxide film<br>
that gives the substrate a high corrosion resistance. The passive layer 12 may<br>
make the surface of the substrate 10 less prone to attacks in corrosive<br><br>
environments, for example in a fuel cell environment. The passive oxide film<br>
may create significant contact resistance with a gas diffusion media.<br>
[0015]	In one embodiment, the thickness of the passive layer 12 may be<br>
about 0.5 nm to about 30 nm. In one embodiment, the thickness of the passive<br>
layer 12 may be about 3 nm to about 4 nm. In one embodiment, the passive<br>
layer 12 may be of a thickness such that the layer will not grow further after it is<br>
positioned in a fuel cell environment. In one embodiment, the thickness of the<br>
passive layer 12 may not increase subsequent to the treating of the substrate 10<br>
to form the passive layer 12.<br>
[0016]	In one embodiment, the substrate 10 may be a bipolar plate 14.<br>
The bipolar plate 14 may have a first face 16 and a second face 18. The bipolar<br>
plate 14 may include two sheets 20 and 22. The two sheets 20 and 22 may be<br>
machined or stamped. The two sheets 20 and 22 may be welded together. A<br>
reactant gas flow field comprising flow channels 24 and lands 26 is defined in the<br>
first face 16. The channels 24 may be defined by sidewall(s) 28 and bottom wall<br>
30. Cooling fluid flow channels 32 may be provided, for example but not limited<br>
to, over the second face 18.<br>
[0017]	Referring to FIG. 2, one embodiment of the invention includes a<br>
method including depositing an electrically conductive coating 34 over the<br>
substrate 10 with the passive layer 12. The electrically conductive coating 34<br>
may comprise at least one of gold, platinum, ruthenium, or iridium. The<br>
electrically conductive coating 34 may have a thickness of about 0.1 nm to about<br>
50 nm. In one embodiment, the electrically conductive coating 34 may have a<br><br>
thickness of about 0.1 nm to about 2 nm. The depositing of the electrically<br>
conductive coating 34 may comprise at least one of physical vapor deposition<br>
methods, for example but not limited to, magnetron sputtering, electron beam<br>
evaporation, or ion assisted deposition. In one embodiment, the electrically<br>
conductive coating 34 is porous, but the contact resistance does not increase<br>
any further inside a corrosive environment, for example inside a fuel cell,<br>
because the passive layer 12 was pre-grown on the substrate 10 before applying<br>
the electrically conductive coating 34.<br>
[0018]	Referring to FIG. 3, one embodiment of the invention includes a<br>
product 36 comprising the substrate 10. The product 36 may be a fuel cell 38<br>
and the substrate 10 may include at least one fuel cell bipolar plate 14. One<br>
embodiment of the invention includes a first fuel cell bipolar plate 40 and a<br>
second fuel cell bipolar plate 42. The bipolar plates 40, 42 each include a first<br>
face 16 having a reactant gas ffow field defined therein by a plurality of lands 26<br>
and channels 24. The bipolar plates 40, 42 may include a variety of materials<br>
including, but not limited to, a metal, a metal alloy, and/or an electrically<br>
conductive composite. In one embodiment, the bipolar plates 40, 42 may be<br>
stainless steel. In other embodiments, the bipolar plates 40, 42 may be one of<br>
titanium, aluminum, or polymeric carbon composites.<br>
[0019]	A soft goods portion 44 may be provided between the first bipolar<br>
plate 40 and the second bipolar plate 42. The soft goods portion 44 may include<br>
a polymer electrolyte membrane 46 comprising a first face 48 and a second face<br>
50. A cathode electrode 52 may overlie the first face 48 of the polymer<br><br>
electrolyte membrane 46. A first gas diffusion media layer 54 may overlie the<br>
cathode electrode 52, and optionally a first microporous layer 56 may be<br>
interposed between the first gas diffusion media layer 54 and the cathode<br>
electrode 52. The first gas diffusion media layer 54 may be hydrophobic. The<br>
first bipolar plate 40 may overlie the first gas diffusion media layer 54.<br>
[0020]	An anode electrode 58 may underlie the second face 50 of the<br>
polymer electrolyte membrane 46 A second gas diffusion media layer 60 may<br>
underlie the anode electrode 58, and optionally a second microporous layer 62<br>
may be interposed between the second gas diffusion media layer 60 and the<br>
anode electrode 58. The second gas diffusion media layer 60 may be<br>
hydrophobic. The second bipolar plate 42 may overlie the second gas diffusion<br>
media layer 60.<br>
[0021]	In various embodiments, the polymer electrolyte membrane 46 may<br>
comprise a variety of different types of membranes. The polymer electrolyte<br>
membrane 46 useful in various embodiments of the invention may be an ion-<br>
conductive material. Examples of suitable membranes are disclosed in U. S.<br>
Patent Nos. 4,272,353 and 3,134,689, and in the Journal of Power Sources,<br>
Volume 28 (1990), pages 367-387. Such membranes are also known as ion<br>
exchange resin membranes. The resins include ionic groups in their polymeric<br>
structure; one ionic component for which is fixed or retained by the polymeric<br>
matrix and at least one other ionic component being a mobile replaceable ion<br>
electrostatically associated with the fixed component. The ability of the mobile<br><br>
ion to be replaced under appropriate conditions with other ions imparts con<br>
exchange characteristics to these materials.<br>
[0022]	The ion exchange resins can be prepared by polymerizing a<br>
mixture of ingredients, one of which contains an ionic constituent. One broad<br>
class of cationic exchange, proton conductive resins is the so-called sulfonic acid<br>
cationic exchange resin. in the sulfonic acid membranes, the cationic exchange<br>
groups are sulfonic acid groups which are attached to the polymer backbone.<br>
[0023]	The formation of these ion exchange resins into membranes or<br>
chutes is well-known to those skilled in the art. The preferred type is<br>
perfluorinated sulfonic acid polymer electrolyte in which the entire membrane<br>
structure has ionic exchange characteristics. These membranes are<br>
commercially available, and a typical example of a commercial sulfonic<br>
perfluorocarbon proton conductive membrane is sold by E. l. DuPont D Nemours<br>
&amp; Company under the trade designation NAFlON. Other such membranes are<br>
available from Asahi Glass and Asahi Chemical Company. The use of other<br>
types of membranes, such as, but not limited to, perfluorinated cation-exchange<br>
membranes, hydrocarbon based cation-exchange membranes as well as anion-<br>
exchange membranes are also within the scope of the invention.<br>
[0024]	In one embodiment, the first gas diffusion media layer 54 or the<br>
second gas diffusion media layer 60 may include any electrically conductive<br>
porous material. In various embodiments, the gas diffusion media layer 54 or 60<br>
may include non-woven carbon fiber paper or woven carbon cloth which may be<br>
treated with a hydrophobic material, such as, but not limited to, polymers of<br><br>
polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), fluroethylene propylene, or<br>
polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). The gas diffusion media layer 54 or 60 may<br>
have an average pore size ranging from 5-40 micrometers. The gas diffusion<br>
media layer 54 or 60 may have a thickness ranging from about 100 to about 500<br>
micrometers.<br>
[0025]	In one embodiment the cathode electrode 52 and the anode<br>
electrode 58 (cathode layer and anode layer) may be catalyst layers which may<br>
include catalyst particles such as platinum, and an ion conductive material such<br>
as a proton conducting ionomer, intermingled with the particles. The proton<br>
conductive material may be an ionomer such as a perfluorinated sulfonic acid<br>
polymer. The catalyst materials may include metals such as platinum, palladium,<br>
and mixtures of metals such as platinum and molybdenum, platinum and cobalt,<br>
platinum and ruthenium, platinum and nickel, platinum and tin, other platinum<br>
transition-metal alloys, and other fuel cell electrocatalysts known in the art. The<br>
catalyst materials may be finely divided if desired. The catalyst materials may be<br>
unsupported or supported on a variety of materials such as but not limited to<br>
finely divided carbon particles.<br>
[0026]	In one embodiment, the first microporous layer 56 or the second<br>
microporous layer 62 may be made from materials such as carbon blacks and<br>
hydrophobic constituents such as polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and<br>
polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), and may have a thickness ranging from about 2<br>
to about 100 micrometers. In one embodiment the microporous layer 56 or 62<br>
may include a plurality of particles, for example including graphitized carbon, and<br><br>
a binder. In one embodiment the binder may include a hydrophobic polymer<br>
such as, but not limited to, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), fluoroethylene<br>
propylene (FEP), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), or other organic or inorganic<br>
hydrophobic materials. The particles and binder may be included in a liquid<br>
phase which may be, for example, a mixture of an organic solvent and water to<br>
provide dispersion. In various embodiments, the solvent may include at least<br>
one of 2-propanol, 1-propanol or ethanol, etc. The dispersion may be applied to<br>
a fuel cell substrate, for example, but not limited to, a gas diffusion media layer.<br>
In another embodiment, the dispersion may be applied to an electrode. The<br>
dispersion may be dried (by evaporating the solvent) and the resulting dried<br>
microporous layer may include 60-90 weight percent particles and 10-40 weight<br>
percent binder. In various other embodiments, the binder may range from 10-30<br>
weight percent of the dried microporous layer.<br>
[0027]	In one embodiment, the bipolar plates 40 and 42 may have a low<br>
contact resistance with the gas diffusion media and a high corrosion resistance in<br>
the fuel cell environment. In one embodiment, the fuel cell 38 may have a higher<br>
performance and durability. In one embodiment, the passive layer 12 and the<br>
electrically conductive coating 34 may contribute to better water management<br>
within the fuel cell 38. The water management may result from the electrically<br>
conductive coating being applied over a hydrophilic passive oxide film. Water<br>
management may be important because during operation of the fuel cell,<br>
moisture from the MEAs and external humidification may enter the anode and<br>
cathode flow channels. As the size of the water droplets increases, the flow<br><br>
channel is closed off, and the reactant gas is diverted to other flow channels<br>
because the channels flow in parallel between common inlet and outlet<br>
manifolds. Because the reactant gas may not flow through a channel that is<br>
blocked with water, the reactant gas cannot force the water out of the channel.<br>
Those areas of the membrane that do not receive reactant gas as a result of the<br>
channel being blocked will not generate electricity, thus resulting in a non-<br>
homogenous current distribution and reducing the overall efficiency of the fuel<br>
cell. As more and more flow channels are blocked by water, the electricity<br>
produced by the fuel cell decreases<br>
[0028]	Referring to FIG. 4, a graph is provided showing the cell voltage<br>
and high frequency resistance (HFR) versus current density. In this experiment a<br>
316L stainless steel cathode plate was passivated in a nitric acid solution and<br>
then coated with 10 nm pVD gold on top of the passive film. A fuel cell was then<br>
assembled using this cathode plate and an anode graphite plate using a Gore<br>
5720 MEA. The cell was run under cyclic conditions of relative humidity, and a<br>
steady state polarization curve was recorded. FIG. 4 shows a stable value of<br>
high frequency resistance of 53 mohm cm2, which is almost identical to what is<br>
normally measured on gold coated stainless steel without the current passivation<br>
treatment. This was reflected on the fuel cell performance which showed a<br>
current density of 1500 mA/cm2 at 0.63 V, which meets or even exceeds the<br>
target of 0.6 V at this current density to allow for fuel cell commercialization.<br>
[0029]	In one experiment, a 304L stainless steel sample was passivated in<br>
a nitric acid solution to remove any residual iron resulting from any mechanical<br><br>
treatments of the stainless steel. This resulted in a contact resistance of 115<br>
mohm cm2 "paper/sample" at 200 psi. Then a thin PVD gold layer was sputtered<br>
on top of this passivated surface and a contact resistance of 6-7 mohm cm2 was<br>
achieved. This experiment shows that the resistance may be mainly due to the<br>
contact between the GDM and the passive film and not due to the bulk resistance<br>
of the passive film, which is insignificant.<br>
[0030]	In another experiment, a titanium coupon was polished using a 3M<br>
Scotch-Brite pad. The contact resistance on the polished titanium coupon was<br>
7.5 mohm cm2 "paper/sample" at 200 psi. The same titanium sample was<br>
passivated at +0.6V (Ag/AgCI) in an aerated 0.1 ppm HF solution of pH = 3 at<br>
80°C. The contact resistance was measured on this sample after the cathode<br>
side experiment and a value of 300 mohm cm2 was measured. Then a thin PVD<br>
layer of gold was sputtered on the passivated titanium coupon and the contact<br>
resistance was measured to be 7 mohm cm2.<br>
[0031]	In one embodiment, the corrosion resistance of the stainless steel<br>
may be retained through the build up of a coherent passive film on its surface<br>
which can be done in the steel mill, which upon depositing a conductive layer, for<br>
example a thin layer of Au, would reduce the contact resistance on the surface of<br>
the stainless steel.<br>
[0032]	When the terms "over", "overlying", "overlies", or "under",<br>
"underlying", "underlies" are used with respect to the relative position of a first<br>
component or layer with respect to a second component or layer, such shall<br>
mean that the first component or layer is in direct contact with the second<br><br>
component or layer, or that additional layers or components are interposed<br>
between the first component or layer and the second component or layer.<br>
[0033]	The above description of embodiments of the invention is merely<br>
exemplary in nature and, thus, variations thereof are not to be regarded as a<br>
departure from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br><br>
