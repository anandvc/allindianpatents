				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to an improved washing machine with talking voice means.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Washing means, whether it be front or top loading, have video and audio means for providing a signal in the event of an error or fault in the operation of the machine. Thus, and as by way of example, if the lid of the machine is open though it is intended to be in a closed status, means are provided to provide a visual and audio signal of the presence of such an error. The visual signal means normally comprises an error detection circuit connected to visual means, such as light emitting diodes and to audio signal means such as buzzer.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of this invention is to propose an improved washing machine having talking<br>
voice signal means to provide talking instructions of the presence of an error.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose a washing machine having talking voice signal means to direct an operator for the operations of the washing machine.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to propose a washing machine which is efficient.<br>
Further objects and advantages of this invention will be more apparent from the ensuing description.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
According to this invention there is provided an improved washing machine with talking voice means comprising:<br>
(a)	an outer tub disposed in an outer casing of the washing machine;<br>
(b)	spin basket disposed in the said outer tub which is adapted to provide spin action to the clothes during the washing operation of machine;<br>
(c)	a pulsator provided at the bottom of said spin basket which is adapted to provide pulsating action during washing of clothes;<br>
(d)	a motor provided at the bottom end of said outer casing which is adapted to rotate the mounting means which support the said outer casing;<br>
(e)	a top cover assembly provided at the top end of the said outer casing which is adapted to cover the open end thereof;<br>
charcterised in that:-<br>
(f)	talking voice means are provided which comprise:-<br>
a main controller adapted to receive signals from the sensors secured with different components such as drain motor, feed valve, safety switch, motor pressure sensor; a circuit means to receive the signals and to process and feed the same to a sound box comprising a memory chip connected to a decoder which is adapted to convert voice signals into the talking signals which are fed to a speaker through an amplifier; a power circuit to energise the circuit of the said sound box.<br>
Specifically, in accordance with this invention, the washing machine has a voice circuit which is activated in the event of an error present in the operation of the machine. Thus, as by way of example if the cover or door of the machine is in an open status when intended to be in a closed status, such an error is detected by the door sensor which activates the first and second circuit and the talking voice circuit. Reference is made herein only to the door or cover sensor. However, a plurality of such sensors are provided to detect various errors which then activate its respective voice circuit.<br>
Besides, the error indication the talking voice circuit is provided to render directions in the form of talking voice for operation of the machine. Thus, and by way of example, if the door is to be closed, the voice circuit for directions is activated to provide talking directions "please close the lid".<br>
In accordance with another embodiment audio/visual display means are also provided to provided an audio/visual display of the error simultaneously or separately.<br>
A washing machine having a talking features according to a preferred embodiment of<br>
the present invention is herein described and illustrated in the accompanying drawings<br>
wherein:<br>
Fig. 1 shows the left side view of the machine<br>
Fig. 2 shows the back view of the machine and<br>
Fig. 3 shows the block diagram of the talking voice means.<br>
Referring to the drawings particularly fig. 1 and 2 the washing machine of the present invention has an outer tub 1 disposed into an outer casing 2 of the machine. A spin basket 3 is disposed into the outer tub 1 such that to provide a spin action to the clothes during the washing condition of the machine. A pulsator 4 is provided at the bottom end of said spin basket for providing pulsating action during the washing operation of the machine. A motor 5 is provided at the bottom end of the outer casing such that to rotate the mounting means 6 provided for supporting said outer casing 1. A top cover assembly 7 is provided at the top end of the outer casing 2 for covering the open top end thereof. A plurality of sensors are provided for providing visual/audio indication to the user so as to facilitate the operation of the machine by the user. These features are as such known in the prior art and do not constitute inventive features of the present invention.<br>
Specifically, according to the present invention and as shown in fig.3 the talking voice means comprises a main controller 8 such that to receive the signals from the sensor (not shown) secured with the different component for example drain motor 9, feed valve 10, safety switch 11, motor 12 and pressure sensor 13 such that to receive the signals and to process the same to supply said signals to a sound box 14. The sound box 14 has a memory chip 15 being connected to a decoder 16 provided to convert the voice signals into the talking signals and which are being fed to a speaker 17 through an amplifier so as to provide talking instructions to the user of the machine for facilitating the operation of the machine by the user. A power supply 18 is provided to energize the circuit of the sound box 14.<br>
During the operation of the machine sound box activated in the event of an error during the operation of the machine thus by way of example and as described herein the cover of the door of the machine is in an open status when intended to be in a closed status, such an error is detected by the door sensor which activates the first and second circuit and the talking voice circuit. Reference is made herein only to the door or cover sensor. However, a plurality of such sensors are provided to detect various errors which then activate its respective voice circuit.<br>
Besides, the error indication the talking voice circuit is provided to render directions in the form of talking voice for operation of the machine. Thus, and by way of example, if the door is to be closed, the voice circuit for directions is activated to provide talking directions "please close the lid".<br><br><br><br><br><br>
