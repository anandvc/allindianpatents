				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a process for extraction of avocado oil.<br>
The invention is aimed at extracting avocado oil without deteriorating oil quality. The<br>
fruit is native to Central America. Avocado plant thrive its best in the sub-tropical and<br>
tropical region. The fruit is grown in the southern part of India/ The shape of the fruit is<br>
pear like with hard thick skin and one round seed. Fruit weight varies between 130 to<br>
500 gm and seed weight between 30 to 60 gm while the average hull weight is 5 gm.<br>
Moisture content of the fruit is 83 to 86%. The variation of oil in the fruit is 32 to 45%<br>
(dry basis). The variation is mainly attributed to the origin of the fruit. Fatty acid<br>
composition also varies with different cultivars, stages of ripening, anatomical region of<br>
the fruit as well as place where it grows. The major fatty acids are oleic (18:1), Palmitic<br>
(16:0), linoleic (18:2) and palmitooleic (16:1). Linolenic and stearic are also present in<br>
traces.<br>
The dark green colour crude oil has certain special properties e.g. its emollient in<br>
nature, rapid absorption into the skin and its ability to act as natural sunscreen, which<br>
make it very useful in the formulation of cosmetic products.<br>
Its skin penetrating power is higher than that of corn, almond, soybean and olive oil (1).<br>
The product formulation data from US showed a total of 240 products containing<br>
avocado oil in concentration range of 0.1 to 50%. The use of avocado oil has been<br>
reported in the preparation of cleansing creams, moisturizers, skin care products, hair<br>
conditioners, lip sticks, suntan lotion and also in bath oil and make-up base ( 2 ). Refined clear oil is generally preferred for food use.<br>
Toxicology test data from human and animal studies using avocado oil as well as cosmetic formulation containing avocado oil ( 3 ) gave a safety assessment for avocado oil.<br>
i.  Encyclopedia of chemical technology, vol.7,153pp., edited by Kirkothmer, John Wiley &amp; sons, Newyork 1979.<br>
2.	FDA Avocado, product Formulation Data, 1976.<br>
3.	Path and toxicology, Vol.4 (4), 93-103, 1980.<br>
Reference may be made to extraction of avocado oil from adocados (Davis, Richard H., US 4444763, 1984), wherein raw avocado oil is extracted from ripe fruit following maceration, heating, addition of herbaceous siliceous material, and pressure extraction. The draw back is heating, which will denature oil as well as minor constituents of the oil.<br>
Reference may be made to process for the recovery of oil from avocado fruit (Curiel, Maurice US 4560568, 1985), where in the avocado fruit is contacted with an acetone solution which extracts the water from the avocado. The drawback is in use of acetone for extraction, since acetone is not of food grade as a solvent.<br><br>
Reference may be made to avocado oil extraction with appropriate technology for<br>
developing countries (Bizimana, V. et al. JAOCS, 70(8), 1993, 821-822). Wherein<br>
extraction was made at pH5.5 and centrifugal force of 12300 x g. Addition of 5%<br>
CaCOa and CaSO4 allowed extraction without organic solvents and at a temperature of<br>
75 to 98°C. The draw backs are in the use of CaCO3, CaSO4 and heat. Heat treatment<br>
will denature the oil as well as minor constituents. Chemicals are not allowed for food<br>
use oil.<br>
Reference may be made to extraction and characterization of avocado oil (Martinez-<br>
Nieto, L. et al. Grasas-Y-Aceites, 39(4/5), 1988, 272-277), wherein oil was extracted<br>
by pressing, centrifugation and solvent extraction of previously dried sliced avocado<br>
had highest-yield. The draw backs are drying and solvent extraction. Drying will<br>
denature the oil and presence of minor constituents. Traces of solvent may remain in<br>
the solvent extracted oil after removing the solvent.<br>
Reference may be made to extraction and refining of oil obtained from dried avocado<br>
fruit using a small expeller (Southwell, KH. et al. Tropical Science, 1990, 30(2), 121-<br>
131), wherein oil was extracted from dried fruit. The draw back is drying the fruit.<br>
Drying will break down the minor constituents present in oil.<br>
Reference may be made to extraction of avocado oil using heat and additional water<br>
(Ferreira, E. Revista CERES. 1973, 20(112), 488-489). wherein the avocado pulp is<br>
heated to boiling point for 15 min. and oil separated. The draw back is heating the pulp.<br>
Heating the oil will deteriorate the oil quality.<br>
Reference may be made to extraction technology and industrialization of residues<br>
(Sadir, R., Revista - Italiana-delle-Sostanze-Grasse, 1972, 49(2), 90-93), wherein the<br>
fruit is first aerobically fermented to release the oil with ethyl alcohol and then extracted<br>
with hexane. The draw back is ethyl alcohol and hexane used. Ethyl alcohol is not<br>
allowed for food grade oil.<br>
Reference may be made to avocado oil production and chemical characteristics<br>
(Werman, MJ and Neeman, I. JAOCS, 1987, 64(2), 229-232), wherein avocado oil<br>
extraction is influenced by temperature, pH and NaCI concentration, and increased<br>
extraction efficiency by centrifugal process. The draw backs are heat treatment and<br>
chemicals used. It may deteriorate oil quality.<br>
Reference may be made to extraction characterization and prediction of the oxidative<br>
stability of avocado oil. (Bizimana, V. Dissertation - Abstracts, International B:58(5)<br>
2195, 1997, 241 pp) wherein oil was extracted from avocado tissues using chloroformmethanol<br>
(2:1) and acetone. The draw back is solvent used. The toxic solvents are not<br>
allowed for food grade oil.<br>
Reference may be made to avocado oil extraction using enzymatic compounds in<br>
industrial plants and analytical characteristics of the oil. (Castaldo, A.et al, Rivista -<br>
Italiana - delle - sostanze - Grasse, 1997, 74(3) 113-116), wherein commercial<br>
enzyme was added at pulping stage and the paste was transferred after 60 min<br>
kneading at 40°C to a three stage decanter and subsequently processed in a Pieralisi<br>
extraction plant. The draw back is heating at 40°C. Again heating deteriorates the<br>
minor constituents of the oil.<br>
Reference may be made to aqueous enzymatic extraction of avocado oil from fresh pulp<br>
(Freitas, SP. et al., Revue - Francaise - des - corps - Gras, 1993, 40(11/12), 365-371),<br>
wherein the peeled avocados were mixed with water at 65°C. The mixture was brought<br>
to a temperature optimal for enzymatic reaction and incubated 30 to 180 min followed<br>
by centrifugation. The draw back is heating. Heating deteriorates the minor<br>
constituents present in the oil.<br>
Reference may be made to modified extraction of avocado oil for analysis by<br>
refractometry (Lewis, CE. And O' Brien, K. Laboratory practice, 1978, 27(10), 865-866),<br>
wherein hard and ripe avocado (2 gm) flesh were dried and extracted the oil into<br>
1-chloronaphthalene in a micro-homogenizer. The ripe fruit was extruded before<br>
drying. The draw backs are using solvent and drying. The used solvent is not food<br>
grade and drying deteriorates the minor constituents present in the oil.<br>
Reference may be made to extraction of avocado oil (Voisin, C. FR 2299399, 1976),<br>
wherein the ripe avocado flesh is pulped and very slowly heated on a water bath. The<br>
hot material is pressed followed by boiling and cooling slowly. The oil is separated by<br>
decanting. The draw back is heating. Heating deteriorates the oil quality as well as<br>
minor constituents.<br>
Reference may be made to enzymatic extraction of avocado oil ( Buenrostro, M.Lopez-<br>
Munguia, CA. Biotechnology Letters, 1986 8(7),505-506), wherein extraction of avocado<br>
oil by a mixture of pectinase, alpha-amylase, protease and cellulase. One hour reaction<br>
at 65°C followed by dilution and centrifugation. Heating deteriorates the oil quality as<br>
well as minor constituents.<br>
Reference may be made to a new technique for preparing and refining avocado oil<br>
(Jaubert, JN. Fruits, 1970, 25(4), 292-294), wherein a new process for preparing<br>
avocado oil is out lined, pressing the pulp, decolorizing and deodorizing, drying in three<br>
phases by centrifugation, evaporation and filtration. The draw back is evaporation. Due<br>
to evaporation volatile compounds will evaporate.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide extraction of avocado oil which obviates the draw backs as detailed above.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides extraction of avocado oil which consists ;<br>
a.	peeling and deseeding of avocado fruit manually;<br>
b.	crushing of peeled and deseeded fruit using mechanical fruit crusher/fruit mill at<br>
an rpm of 600 to 750 for a period of 10 to 20 minutes;<br>
c.	adding with gripping aid such as saw dust with the crushed material obtained<br>
above in a ratio of 1:2 to 3:4 respectively;<br>
d.	pressing the above obtained material using Hydraulic press with a pressure 300<br>
to 500 kg/m2 followed by 1000 to 3000 kg/m2 for a time period in the range of 5-<br>
