				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to an exhaust gas purifying catalyst<br>
suitably used for purifying exhaust gas emitted from an internal combustion<br>
engine, and a method for manufacturing the same.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
In recent years, an exhaust gas purifying catalyst in which noble metal<br>
particles are supported on a metal oxide carrier has been widely used in order to<br>
remove harmful substances such as hydrocarbon (HC), carbon monoxide (CO)<br>
and nitrogen oxide (NOx) contained in exhaust gas emitted from an internal<br>
combustion engine. A conventional exhaust gas purifying catalyst contains a<br>
large amount of noble metal so as to enhance durability of noble metal particles<br>
with respect to peripheral atmospheric fluctuations. On the other hand, the use<br>
of a large amount of noble metal is not desirable in view of protection of earth<br>
resources.<br>
In consideration of such an issue, a catalyst has been disclosed that<br>
contains transition metal such as cerium (Ce) to function as an oxygen storage<br>
component and manganese (Mn) to function as an active oxygen supplying<br>
material provided adjacent to noble metal particles by use of an impregnation<br>
method (refer to Patent Literature 1). This catalyst ensures enhanced durability<br>
of the noble metal particles due to prevention of atmospheric fluctuations at the<br>
periphery of the noble metal particles by the transition metal provided adjacent to<br>
the noble metal particles. In addition, the exhaust gas purifying catalyst<br>
manufactured by such a method is expected to have enhanced activity of the<br>
noble metal particles in addition to enhanced durability of the noble metal<br>
particles.<br>

 <br>
OSC material. However, the structure in which the noble metal particles are<br>
supported on the OSC material is not necessarily appropriate because of the<br>
following reasons. First, the OSC material having an oxygen storage and<br>
release capacity generally causes a large decrease in specific surface area<br>
because of a crystal growth under an exhaust gas atmosphere at high temperature,<br>
compared with alumina or the like known as a carrier to support metal particles.<br>
Therefore, when the noble metal particles are supported on the OSC material, a<br>
decrease in active surface area tends to be easily caused because of aggregation<br>
of the noble metal particles. In addition, rhodium (Rh) tends to have a high<br>
catalytic activity in a reducing state, and tends to have a lower catalytic activity<br>
in a high oxidation state. In the case in which such noble metal is supported on<br>
the OSC material, active oxygen is supplied mainly at the interface between the<br>
noble metal particles and the OSC material, and therefore, the noble metal<br>
particles fall into a high oxidation state. As a result, a decrease in catalytic<br>
performance is caused.<br>
On the other hand, in the structure in which noble metal is not supported<br>
directly on the OSC material, the supply of active oxygen to the noble metal is<br>
delayed when there is a large distance between the OSC material and the noble<br>
metal. As a result, when a flow rate of exhaust gas is rapidly changed during<br>
acceleration and the like, and a catalytic atmosphere varies, a purifying reaction<br>
cannot comply with the change. Accordingly, a purifying performance of the<br>
catalyst is decreased.<br>
In consideration for the above-described conflicting matters, the object of<br>
the present invention is to prevent a decrease in active surface area because of<br>
aggregation of noble metal particles, prevent a high oxidation state of the noble<br>
metal particles, and prevent a delay in supply of active oxygen to the noble metal<br>
particles, so as to improve a purifying performance of the catalyst. More<br>
specifically, one of the subject matters of the present invention is to adjust an<br>
 <br>
average distance between the first compound supporting the noble metal particles<br>
and the second compound having an oxygen storage capacity to between 5 nm<br>
and 300 nm. Due to such a configuration, the supplying efficiency of oxygen to<br>
noble metal is improved, and a decrease in catalytic performance because of<br>
excessive oxygen is prevented. When the average distance is less than 5 nm, a<br>
decrease in purifying performance may be caused because of a high oxidation<br>
state of the noble metal particles. On the other hand, when the average distance<br>
is more than 300 nm, oxygen is not sufficiently supplied to the noble metal<br>
particles, and as a result, a decrease in purifying performance may be caused. A<br>
method for measuring the distance between the first compound and the second<br>
compound will be described below.<br>
Note that, PCT International Publication WO2007/52627 describes the<br>
use of cerium as a first compound. However, this publication does not<br>
specifically describe a distance between noble metal particles and an OSC<br>
material in catalyst powder. In general, an OSC material is added in a catalyst<br>
layer as another particle. Therefore, in the case of using such an addition<br>
method in the catalyst described in the above-mentioned publication, the distance<br>
between the noble metal particles and the OSC material adjusted to 300 nm or<br>
less as in the case of the present invention is not necessarily appropriate. This<br>
is because, in order to adjust the distance to 300 nm or less using a method of<br>
adding an OSC material separately in a catalyst layer, powder that supports noble<br>
metal particles and OSC material particles are both required to be pulverized to<br>
have a size of 300 nm and then applied to obtain a coating layer. However,<br>
when the catalyst layer is formed from such a finely pulverized raw material, a<br>
gas diffusion performance tends to be easily decreased since a volume of fine<br>
pores in the catalyst layer provided from gaps between the particles is decreased.<br>
Further, a decrease in performance of the catalyst layer may be caused since<br>
exfoliation of the catalyst layer is easily caused. In the present invention,<br>
 <br>
however, the OSC material (the second compound) contained in addition to the<br>
first compound supporting the noble metal particles is provided in the catalyst<br>
powder. Therefore, the distance between the noble metal particles and the OSC<br>
material can be adjusted to the range of 5 nm to 300 nm without causing<br>
problems with regard to a gas diffusion performance at the time of forming the<br>
catalyst layer, and exfoliation of the catalyst layer.<br>
The catalyst powder 5 shown in Fig. 1(c) includes, in addition to the first<br>
compound 7 in contact with the noble metal particles 6 and the second compound<br>
9, a third compound (an inclusion material) 10 that encloses both the first<br>
compound 7 and the second compound 9, and separates the first compound 7<br>
from the second compound 9. In addition, the catalyst powder 5 includes<br>
catalyst units 11 containing the noble metal particles 6 and secondary particles of<br>
the first compound 7, and promoter units 12 containing secondary particles of the<br>
second compound 9, and the respective units are enclosed in the regions<br>
partitioned by the third compound 10. It is to be noted that the first compound<br>
7 and the second compound 9 may be provided as primary particles in the<br>
regions partitioned by the third compound 10.<br>
Since the third compound 10 concurrently encloses the first compound 7<br>
as an anchor material and the second compound 9 as an OSC material, this<br>
catalytic structure can be maintained even after a durability test. In addition,<br>
since mutual aggregation and contact of the first compound 7 supporting the<br>
noble metal particles 6 with the second compound 9 as an OSC material are<br>
prevented due to the third compound 10, a high catalytic performance can be<br>
maintained even after a durability test.<br>
The catalyst powder 5 will be explained more specifically. In the<br>
catalyst powder 5, the noble metal particles 6 and the particles of the first<br>
compound 7 come into contact with each other, and the noble metal particles 6<br>
and the first compound 7 are chemically bonded together, so that the movement<br>
 <br>
of the noble metal particles 6 is prevented. Moreover, the periphery of the first<br>
compound 7 on which the noble metal particles 6 are supported is covered and<br>
enclosed with the third compound 10, so that the movement of the noble metal<br>
particles 6 beyond the section partitioned by the third compound 10 is physically<br>
suppressed. Namely, the third compound 10 that functions as a partitioning<br>
member can prevent the noble metal particles 6 from changing into vapor phase<br>
because of oxidation and moving to aggregate with the adjacent noble metal<br>
particles 6. Furthermore, since the first compound 7 is enclosed in the section<br>
partitioned by the third compound 10, a mutual contact and aggregation of the<br>
respective first compounds 7 beyond the section partitioned by the third<br>
compound 10 are prevented. Accordingly, not only aggregation of the first<br>
compound 7 but also aggregation of the noble metal particles 6 supported on the<br>
first compound 7 can be prevented.<br>
In addition, the periphery of the second compound 9 having an oxygen<br>
storage capacity is also covered and enclosed with the third compound 10, so that<br>
a physical movement of the second compound 9 is prevented. Namely, since<br>
the second compound 9 is enclosed in the section partitioned by the third<br>
compound 10, a mutual contact and aggregation of the respective second<br>
compounds 9 beyond the section partitioned by the third compound 10 is<br>
suppressed, so that a decrease in specific surface area can be prevented.<br>
Note that, the third compound 10 used in the catalyst powder 5 does not<br>
completely cover the peripheries of the first compound 7 and the second<br>
compound 9. In other words, the third compound 10 has fine pores having a<br>
size sufficient to allow exhaust gas and active oxygen to pass therethrough, while<br>
covering the first compound 7 and the second compound 9 sufficiently to prevent<br>
a physical movement of the respective compounds. More specifically, as shown<br>
in Fig. 1(c), while the third compound 10 adequately covers the first compound 7<br>
and the second compound 9 and prevent aggregation of the particles of the<br>
 <br>
respective compounds, the third compound 10 having a plurality of fine pores<br>
10a allows exhaust gas and active oxygen to pass through the fine pores 10a.<br>
Accordingly, an average fine pore diameter of the fine pores 10a is preferably<br>
smaller than an average particle diameter of the first compound 7 and the second<br>
compound 9. In particular, the average fine pore diameter of the fine pores 10a<br>
is preferably 30 nm or less, more preferably between 10 nm and 30 nm. This<br>
fine pore diameter may be obtained by a gas adsorption method.<br>
The above-mentioned PCT International Publication WO2007/52627<br>
describes an exhaust gas purifying catalyst including noble metal particles, a first<br>
compound (an anchor material) supporting the noble metal particles, and a<br>
second compound (an inclusion material) enclosing the noble metal particles and<br>
the first compound. Due to such a catalytic structure, the noble metal particles<br>
are controlled to maintain the diameter of approximately 10 nm even after a<br>
durability test, and a specific surface area of the noble metal particles is<br>
increased successfully. However, exhaust gas may not easily come into contact<br>
with active sites because of the structure in which the noble metal particles as<br>
active sites and the anchor material are covered with the inclusion material.<br>
Similarly, active oxygen generated by the OSC material provided in the catalyst<br>
layer but still outside the catalyst powder does not easily come into contact with<br>
the active sites as well as the exhaust gas.<br>
With regard to this matter, the amount of active oxygen may be increased<br>
when the amount of the OSC material to be added in the catalyst layer is<br>
increased. However, in the case in which a large amount of the OSC material is<br>
added and oxygen is excessively released, the atmosphere in the catalyst is more<br>
to lean even when, for example, exhaust gas from an internal combustion engine<br>
is adjusted to an atmosphere between a rich condition and a stoichiometric<br>
condition. As a result, there are problems of a decrease in NOx conversion rate,<br>
and an excessive supply of fuel to the engine because an A/F sensor or an O2<br>
 <br>
sensor provided downstream of the catalyst carries out feedback inadequately.<br>
At the time of stopping supplying fuel, for example, at the time of deceleration,<br>
the atmosphere of exhaust gas is lean. In order to prevent a decrease in NOx<br>
purification rate under the lean atmosphere, a control for reaction between HC<br>
and NOx in the fuel (rich spike) by fuel injection for a short period of time may<br>
be carried out. However, when the amount of the OSC material is provided<br>
excessively, HC derived from the rich spike and active oxygen released from the<br>
OSC material are reacted on the active sites. Thus, a decrease in NOx<br>
purification rate may not be resolved. Therefore, oxygen is required to be<br>
supplied to the active sites appropriately without an increase of the total amount<br>
of the OSC material in the catalyst layer.<br>
One of the methods of supplying active oxygen to the active sites without<br>
increasing the total amount of the OSC material in the catalyst layer is to apply<br>
the OSC material having an oxygen storage capacity to the anchor material that<br>
supports noble metal particles. However, at the interface between the noble<br>
metal particles and the OSC material, oxidation of the noble metal particles is<br>
easily promoted because of the supply of active oxygen to the noble metal<br>
particles.<br>
On the other hand, according to the present invention, the first compound<br>
and the second compound are provided in the same catalyst powder in such a<br>
manner that the average distance between the first compound supporting the<br>
noble metal particles and the second compound having an oxygen storage<br>
capacity is adjusted to a predetermined distance. Therefore, active oxygen<br>
released from the OSC material can be effectively supplied to the active sites.<br>
Accordingly, a high catalyst purifying performance can be achieved even at a<br>
rapid flow rate of exhaust gas and under atmosphere fluctuations, for example, at<br>
the time of acceleration. At the same time, a decrease in activity because of<br>
high oxidization of the noble metal particles can be prevented.<br>
 <br>
As described above, in the catalyst powder 5, since the first compound 7<br>
comes into contact with the noble metal particles 6 so as to be chemically bonded<br>
together, a movement of the noble metal particles 6 is prevented. In addition,<br>
since the third compound 10 encloses the peripheries of the first compound 7 in<br>
contact with the noble metal particles 6 and the second compound 9, a movement<br>
of the noble metal particles 6 is physically prevented. According to these<br>
elements, the exhaust gas purifying catalyst 1 of the present invention can<br>
prevent a decrease in catalytic activity due to aggregation of the noble metal<br>
particles 6 without increasing manufacturing cost and environmental load.<br>
A measurement of the distance between the first compound and the<br>
second compound in the catalyst powder may be carried out according to the<br>
following steps:<br>
(1)	TEM-EDX analysis or HAADF-STEM analysis of the catalyst<br>
powder;<br>
(2)	an outline extraction of the first compound and the second compound<br>
from the images;<br>
(3)	defining circular approximation and each central point from surface<br>
areas based on the extracted outlines; and<br>
(4)	detecting the closest central points and measuring the distance.<br>
The method of the measurement of the distance is not limited to the<br>
above-described method, and may be any methods as long as objectivization and<br>
repeatability can be ensured.<br>
(1) TEM-EDX analysis or HAADF analysis of catalyst powder<br>
Catalyst powder is subjected to embedding treatment using epoxy resin,<br>
followed by curing treatment. Thereafter, an ultrathin piece is formed by use of<br>
an ultramicrotome. Using the ultrathin piece thus obtained, the catalyst powder<br>
is observed by a transmission electron microscope (TEM), or by HAADF-STEM<br>
(High-Angle Annular Dark-Field Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy),<br>
 <br>
so as to discriminate among a first compound, a second compound, and also a<br>
third compound. More specifically, with regard to the analysis conditions in the<br>
case of using TEM-EDX, the obtained images are focused on contrast<br>
(shadowed) areas first. Then, elemental species of the areas are analyzed and<br>
confirmed, so as to identify compound particles including the elements.<br>
Although the elemental species of the first compound and the second<br>
compound may overlap each other, the first compound supporting noble metal is<br>
distinguishable from the second compound by detecting the presence or absence<br>
of noble metal species using EDX (energy dispersive X-ray analyzer). However,<br>
when a particle diameter of noble metal is smaller than a diameter of X-ray beam<br>
of the EDX, noble metal may not be detected. In such a case, when the first<br>
compound and the second compound contain cerium (Ce) or praseodymium (Pr)<br>
as an OSC material, it is preferable to discriminate between the first compound<br>
and the second compound by comparing the contents of Ce or Pr in the first<br>
compound and the second compound with the detected intensity ratio of Ce or Pr,<br>
which are preliminarily obtained during the preparation stage. In the case of the<br>
HAADF-STEM images, the discrimination may be carried out according to<br>
contrasts.<br>
(2)	Outline extraction of first compound and second compound from<br>
images<br>
The outline extraction of the first compound and the second compound is<br>
carried out using the images obtained in the analysis (1) described above. The<br>
extraction may be automatically carried out by contrasts using image processing<br>
software. Alternatively, the extraction may be manually carried out by<br>
transcription of the images on OHP sheets or the like.<br>
(3)	Defining circular approximation and each central point from surface<br>
areas based on extracted outlines, and (4) detecting closest central point and<br>
measuring distance<br>
 <br>
The steps (3) and (4) may be carried out using commercially available<br>
image processing software. That is, the areas of the first compound and the<br>
second compound are calculated according to the extracted outlines, and circles<br>
having the same areas as the first compound and the second compound are<br>
presumed. Then, the second compound closest to a specific first compound is<br>
detected, and the distance between the respective centers of the circles is<br>
measured. Accordingly, the distance between the particles can be obtained.<br>
With regard to the distance between the first compound and the second<br>
compound, when the first compound and the second compound are primary<br>
particles, a distance between the respective primary particles is the distance<br>
between the particles described above. When the first compound and the<br>
second compound are secondary particles, a distance between the catalyst unit 11<br>
composed of the noble metal particles 6 and secondary particles including the<br>
first compound 7, and the promoter unit 12 composed of secondary particles of<br>
the second compound 9 is the distance between the particles.<br>
In the catalyst powder, in the case in which the first compound and the<br>
second compound are enclosed with the third compound, the average diameter of<br>
the secondary particles of the first compound and the second compound is<br>
between 5 nm and 300 nm, and the degree of dispersion described below is 40%<br>
or more, the first compound and the second compound may be considered to be<br>
uniformly dispersed mutually. In other words, it is physically hard to prepare<br>
catalyst powder in which the first compound and the second compound are<br>
ununiformly dispersed purposely under the above-described conditions.<br>
Therefore, in such a case, the strict discrimination between the first compound<br>
and the second compound in the whole catalyst powder may be omitted.<br>
Fig. 2 shows one example of the TEM-EDX photographs of the catalyst<br>
powder. In the measurement of the distance between the particles, the<br>
photograph obtained using the TEM-EDX is first subjected to image processing,<br>
 <br>
as shown in Fig. 2, so as to extract the outlines of the respective particles of the<br>
first compound 7 and the second compound 9. Next, the surface areas of the<br>
respective particles are calculated, and circles having the same areas as the<br>
respective particles are presumed. Then, the second compound 9 closest to the<br>
specific first compound 7 is detected, and the distance between the respective<br>
centers of the circles is measured. Note that, in Fig. 2, the line connecting the<br>
first compound 7 to the second compound 9 is indicated by a solid line, and the<br>
line connecting the respective first compounds 7 or the line connecting the<br>
respective second compounds 9 is indicated by a dashed line.<br>
Fig. 3 is a graph showing the distance between the first compound 7 and<br>
the second compound 9 obtained as described above as a horizontal axis, and<br>
showing frequency of appearance as a vertical axis. In the catalyst according to<br>
the present invention, the distance between the anchor material (the first<br>
compound) and the OSC material (the second compound) is shorter than that in a<br>
conventional catalyst. Therefore, the catalyst of the present invention can<br>
ensure a sufficient supply of active oxygen to the noble metal particles and exert<br>
an excellent purifying performance compared with a conventional catalyst.<br>
Note that, it is preferable that the ratio of the amount of the oxygen<br>
storage component contained in the first compound and the amount of the<br>
oxygen storage component contained in the second compound satisfy the<br>
following mathematical formula (1).<br>
[Math 1]<br>
Amountof oxygenstoragecomponentcontainedin secondcompound(mol)<br>
Amountof oxygenstoragecomponentcontainedin first compound(mol)<br>
In general, in the case in which noble metal particles of which a catalytic<br>
performance is enhanced in a reduction condition, such as rhodium, are<br>
supported on a first compound, when the first compound contains a large amount<br>
of an OSC material, the noble metal particles fall into a high oxidation state<br>
 <br>
because of active oxygen in the OSC material. As a result, a decrease in<br>
performance of the noble metal particles may be caused. On the other hand, in<br>
the case in which the OSC material is contained in the second compound, and the<br>
average distance between the first compound and the second compound is<br>
adjusted to 5 nm to 300 nm, a reduction state of the noble metal particles can be<br>
maintained while active oxygen is sufficiently supplied to the noble metal<br>
particles. Note that, the catalyst of the present invention is not limited to the<br>
case in which the first compound does not contain the OSC material, and the first<br>
compound may contain a small amount of the OSC material. In addition, when<br>
the amounts of the OSC material in the first compound and the second compound<br>
are adjusted so as to satisfy the mathematical formula (1), degradation of the<br>
noble metal particles caused by oxidation can be prevented while the amount of<br>
active oxygen is ensured sufficiently. Here, when a molar ratio of the amount<br>
of the OSC material in the second compound to that in the first compound is 1.5<br>
or less, the amount of the OSC material in the first compound is relatively<br>
increased. As a result, a promotion of oxidation and a decrease in performance<br>
of the noble metal particles may be caused.<br>
In the catalyst according to the present invention, an average diameter of<br>
the secondary particles of the first compound is preferably 300 nm or less, and an<br>
average diameter of the secondary particles of the second compound is<br>
preferably 1000 nm or less. When the average diameter of the secondary<br>
particles of the first compound is more than 300 nm, a function as an anchor<br>
material holding the fine noble metal particles may be decreased rapidly. In<br>
addition, when the average diameter of the secondary particles of the second<br>
compound is more than 1000 nm, it is hard to enclose the first compound and the<br>
second compound concurrently with the third compound. In the present<br>
invention, however, since the average diameter of the secondary particles of the<br>
first compound is 300 nm or less, and the average diameter of the secondary<br>
 <br>
particles of the second compound is 1000 nm or less, active oxygen can be<br>
supplied to the noble metal particles while a reduction state of the noble metal<br>
particles is maintained.<br>
The average diameter of the secondary particles of the first compound is<br>
more preferably 200 nm or less. Due to such a configuration, aggregation of<br>
the noble metal particles is further suppressed since the amount of the noble<br>
metal particles supported on the secondary particles of the first compound is<br>
further decreased. In addition, the average diameter of the secondary particles<br>
of the second compound is more preferably 300 nm or less. Accordingly, a rate<br>
of supply of oxygen is improved and a catalytic performance is enhanced since<br>
the surface area of the second compound is significantly increased.<br>
The respective average diameters of the secondary particles of the first<br>
compound and the second compound may be obtained by analysis of slurry<br>
containing the respective particles during the preparation of the catalyst powder<br>
using a laser diffraction particle size distribution analyzer. Note that, the<br>
average diameter of the secondary particles in this case is a median diameter<br>
(D50). Alternatively, the average diameter of the secondary particles of the<br>
respective compounds may be measured from TEM photographs of the prepared<br>
catalyst powder.<br>
In the catalyst according to the present invention, an average particle<br>
diameter of the catalyst powder 5 is preferably 6 urn or less. This average<br>
particle diameter of the catalyst powder is a particle diameter of the catalyst<br>
powder 5 obtained in the case in which the surfaces of the inner walls of the<br>
through-holes of the honeycomb refractory inorganic substrate 2 are coated with<br>
the catalyst powder. When the average particle diameter of the catalyst powder<br>
5 is more than 6 (am, a distance from the periphery to the core of the catalyst<br>
powder is increased, and a gas diffusion performance toward the powder core is<br>
significantly decreased. As a result, a purification performance may be<br>
 <br>
decreased. In addition, when the average particle diameter is more than 6 urn,<br>
exfoliation or unevenness of the catalyst powder at the time of coating on the<br>
honeycomb substrate tends to be easily caused. The average particle diameter<br>
of the catalyst powder 5 is more preferably within a range of 1 µm to 4 µm, so<br>
that proper gaps are formed in the powder and exfoliation can be prevented.<br>
Moreover, the catalyst powder 5 preferably has 40% or more of degree of<br>
dispersion of the first compound 7 and the second compound 9 in the catalyst<br>
powder. The degree of dispersion can be obtained according to the following<br>
mathematical formula (2).<br>
 <br>
In the formula, "a" represents a standard deviation of a distribution of the<br>
distance between the first compound and the second compound in the catalyst<br>
powder 5. "Av." represents an average distance between the first compound<br>
and the second compound 9 in the catalyst powder 5.<br>
Fig. 4 is a graph showing a relationship between the distance between the<br>
first compound 7 and the second compound 9 in the catalyst powder 5. and<br>
frequency of appearance of the distance. As shown in Fig. 4, in the graph of the<br>
result of the measurement of the distance between the first compound and the<br>
second compound, when it is assumed that a frequency distribution is a normal<br>
distribution, the degree of dispersion is expressed as a probability of the presence<br>
of an arbitrary sample within the range of a. Note that, the phrase "a represents<br>
a standard deviation" means that 68.26% of the distances between the first<br>
compounds 7 and the second compounds 9 is distributed within the range of an<br>
average distance Av (nm) ± σ (nm).<br>
Fig. 5 shows a schematic view of an example of catalyst powder of which<br>
degree of dispersion is high (Fig. 5(a)), and a schematic view of an example of<br>
 <br>
catalyst powder of which degree of dispersion is low (Fig. 5(b)). If all the<br>
distances between the first compounds and the second compounds would be<br>
equal, the degree of dispersion of the catalyst is 100% (this means that the<br>
dispersion of the distances is 0). When the dispersion of the distances is large,<br>
the degree of dispersion of the catalyst is closer to 0%. Namely, when all the<br>
distances between the first compounds and the second compounds are<br>
geometrically equal, a is 0 and the degree of dispersion is 100%.<br>
As described above, the degree of dispersion defined as such is preferably<br>
40% or more. When the degree of dispersion is 40% or more, a sufficient<br>
distance between the respective particles is ensured, and unevenness is decreased<br>
to a low level. As a result, aggregation between the compounds after a<br>
durability test is prevented.<br>
This degree of dispersion is mutually related to the level of aggregation of<br>
the first compound and the second compound immediately before drying of<br>
slurry in which the first compound, the second compound, and the precursor of<br>
the third compound are mixed. Since the level of aggregation is dependent on a<br>
stirring force of the slurry, the degree of dispersion can be improved when the<br>
slurry is intensively stirred.<br>
The first compound 7 may contain at least one main component selected<br>
from the group consisting of aluminum oxide (Al2O3), cerium oxide (CeO2).<br>
zirconium oxide (ZrO2), yttrium oxide (Y2O3) and neodymium oxide (Nd2O3).<br>
Among these, the particles of the first compound 7 preferably contain Al2O3 or<br>
ZrO2 as a main component since Al2O3 and ZrO2 have excellent resistance to<br>
high temperature and can maintain a high specific surface area. In the present<br>
description, the main component is a component of which the content in the<br>
particles is 50 atom% or more.<br>
The second compound 9 preferably contains at least one of cerium (Ce)<br>
and praseodymium (Pr) that have an oxygen storage and release capacity.<br>
 <br>
Particularly, the second compound preferably contains a compound as a main<br>
component having a high oxygen storage and release capacity, such as cerium<br>
oxide (CeO2) and praseodymium oxide (Pr6O11). Both Ce and Pr are materials<br>
that constitute multivalent oxides, have a variable oxidation number because of<br>
atmospheric fluctuations of exhaust gas, and can store and release active oxygen.<br>
As the noble metal particles 6, at least one element selected from the<br>
group consisting of platinum (Pt), palladium (Pd), rhodium (Rh), gold (Au),<br>
silver (Ag), iridium (Ir) and ruthenium (Ru) may be used. Among these,<br>
particularly platinum (Pt), palladium (Pd) and rhodium (Rh) can exert a high<br>
NOx purifying performance.<br>
The catalyst powder 5 is particularly preferably an oxide in which the<br>
noble metal particles 6 are rhodium (Rh) and the first compound 7 contains at<br>
least zirconium (Zr). A catalytic performance of Rh tends to be easily<br>
decreased in a high oxidation state. However, high oxidization and aggregation<br>
of Rh can be suppressed by an adequate adjustment of the distance between the<br>
first compound and the second compound.<br>
The high oxidization of Rh may be measured according to binding energy<br>
analysis by use of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). In general, it is<br>
known that 3d5 orbital binding energy of Rh is 307.2 eV in a metal state, and is<br>
approximately 310.2 eV in a high oxidation state. When an oxide such as Al2O3<br>
and ZrO2 is used as an anchor material, the 3d5 orbital binding energy of Rh is<br>
preferably 308.8 eV or less since a decrease in catalytic performance is caused<br>
when the 3d5 orbital binding energy is 308.8 eV or more. The 3d5 orbital<br>
binding energy of Rh may be adjusted to 308.8 eV or less by an adequate<br>
adjustment of the distance between the first compound and the second compound.<br>
At the time of measuring binding energy, a charge correction is generally carried<br>
out using a certain element, and binding energy of an element with a large<br>
content is corrected with respect to a literature value. For example,<br>
 <br>
hydrocarbon contained in oil mist or the like derived from a pump for<br>
maintaining an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer in a vacuum state is used, and a<br>
C1s peak of this hydrocarbon is compared with a literature value, so as to carry<br>
out the correction.<br>
As described above, when the noble metal particles 6 are rhodium, the<br>
first compound 7 is preferably an oxide containing zirconium as a main<br>
component. In the case in which the first compound 7 is an oxide containing<br>
alumina as a main component, rhodium and alumina form a solid solution, and<br>
rhodium is subjected to high oxidization. As a result, a catalytic activity may<br>
be decreased. On the other hand, in the case of an oxide containing Zr, more<br>
preferably in the case of an oxide containing 50% or more of Zr in the first<br>
compound in terms of atom%, high oxidization and aggregation of Rh can be<br>
suppressed. Examples of such an oxide containing Zr as a main component<br>
include zirconia (ZrO2), and lanthanum-containing zirconia (Zr-La-Ox) and<br>
lanthanum-ceria-containing zirconia (Zr-La-Ce-Ox).<br>
When the catalyst of the present invention includes the third compound,<br>
the third compound 10 preferably contains at least one of aluminum (A1) and<br>
silicon (Si). The third compound is preferably made of a material that can<br>
enclose the first compound and the second compound, and also ensure gas<br>
permeability. With regard to such a material, a compound containing at least<br>
one of Al and Si, such as alumina (Al2O3) and silica (SiO2), has a large volume<br>
of fine pores, and can ensure high gas permeability. The third compound may<br>
be a composite compound (a composite oxide) of Al and Si.<br>
The third compound 10 has a plurality of the fine pores 10a having a size<br>
sufficient to allow exhaust gas and active oxygen to pass therethrough as<br>
described above, while the third compound 10 covers the first compound 7 and<br>
the second compound 9 sufficiently to prevent a physical movement of the<br>
respective compounds. As the third compound 10, alumina or silica may be<br>
 <br>
used. When the third compound 10 contains alumina, it is preferable to use<br>
boehmite (AlOOH) as a precursor. That is, the first compound 7 supporting the<br>
noble metal particles 6 and the second compound 9 are added to slurry obtained<br>
in such a manner that boehmite is dispersed in a solvent such as water, and then<br>
stirred. Thus, boehmite is adhered to the peripheries of the first compound 7<br>
and the second compound 9. Subsequently, the mixed slurry is dried and baked,<br>
so that boehmite is dehydrated and condensed at the peripheries of the first<br>
compound 7 and the second compound 9. Accordingly, the third compound<br>
containing alumina derived from boehmite (for example, γ-alumina) is formed.<br>
The third compound thus obtained containing alumina derived from boehmite has<br>
excellent gas permeability while covering the first compound 7 and the second<br>
compound 9, since the third compound has a large number of fine pores having a<br>
size of 30 nm or less.<br>
Similarly, when the third compound contains silica, silica sol and zeolite<br>
are used as a precursor. That is, the first compound 7 supporting the noble<br>
metal particles 6 and the second compound 9 are added to slurry obtained in such<br>
a manner that silica sol and zeolite are dispersed in a solvent, and then stirred,<br>
followed by drying and baking. Thus, the third compound containing silica is<br>
formed. The third compound thus obtained containing silica derived from silica<br>
sol and zeolite also has excellent gas permeability while covering the first<br>
compound 7 and the second compound 9, since the third compound has a large<br>
number of fine pores having a size of 30 nm or less.<br>
At least one of the first compound and the second compound is preferably<br>
an oxide further containing at least one element selected from the group<br>
consisting of iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), cobalt (Co) and nickel (Ni). Namely,<br>
as described above, the first compound 7 contains alumina and zirconia as a main<br>
component, and the second compound 9 contains cerium oxide and<br>
praseodymium oxide as a main component. In addition, at least one of the first<br>
 <br>
compound and the second compound preferably contains transition metal<br>
described above as an additive. When at least one transition metal is contained<br>
in at least one of these compounds, a catalytic activity, especially a purification<br>
rate of CO and NOx, can be improved due to active oxygen contained in<br>
transition metal.<br>
In addition, at least one of the first compound and the second compound<br>
preferably further contains at least one NOx adsorbing material selected from the<br>
group consisting of barium (Ba), magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), strontium (Sr)<br>
and sodium (Na). A compound containing such an element functions as a NOx<br>
adsorbing material. Therefore, when at least one of the first compound and the<br>
second compound contains a NOx adsorbing material, a NOx purification<br>
performance is improved. This is because a NOx adsorbing reaction has high<br>
sensitivity to contact with gas. The catalyst containing such a NOx adsorbing<br>
material is preferably used as a catalyst for a lean burn engine in which a large<br>
amount of NOx is generated rather than an engine in which fuel combustion is<br>
carried out around a stoichiometric air-fuel ratio.<br>
In the case in which the catalyst according to the present invention is used<br>
for exhaust gas purification for an actual vehicle, the catalyst powder 5 is applied<br>
to the inner surface of the refractory inorganic substrate 2, as shown in Fig. 1,<br>
and then the refractory inorganic substrate 2 is installed in a flow path of exhaust<br>
gas of an internal combustion engine. The catalyst layer applied to the<br>
refractory inorganic substrate may be composed of plural layers having different<br>
component compositions. When the plural catalyst layers 3 and 4 are formed<br>
on the refractory inorganic substrate, at least one of the catalyst layers 3 and 4<br>
may contain the catalyst powder 5.<br>
[Method for manufacturing exhaust gas purifying catalyst]<br>
The following is an explanation of a method for manufacturing the<br>
exhaust gas purifying catalyst according to the present invention. In the<br>
 <br>
exhaust gas purifying catalyst according to the present invention, the noble metal<br>
particles, the first compound and the second compound, and the third compound<br>
as necessary, are preliminarily prepared. The catalyst powder is then obtained<br>
according to the process including the step of supporting the noble metal<br>
particles on the first compound, and the step of mixing the first compound<br>
supporting the noble metal particles with the second compound. When the<br>
catalyst includes the third compound, the first compound supporting the noble<br>
metal particles and the second compound are mixed first, followed by adding the<br>
third compound thereto, so as to obtain the catalyst powder.<br>
More preferably, the process of obtaining the catalyst powder further<br>
includes the step of pulverizing the first compound and the second compound<br>
integrally or individually, followed by enclosing the first compound and the<br>
second compound after pulverization simultaneously with a precursor of the third<br>
compound.<br>
More specifically, the noble metal particles 6 are supported on the first<br>
compound 7 first. The noble metal particles 6 may be supported by use of an<br>
impregnation method. Then, the first compound 7 supporting the noble metal<br>
particles 6 on the surface thereof is pulverized by use of a bead mill or the like,<br>
so as to have a desired particle diameter. Similarly, the second compound 9 is<br>
pulverized by used of a bead mill or the like, so as to have a desired particle<br>
diameter. In this case, the first compound 7 and the second compound 9 may be<br>
pulverized in a mixed state, or may be mixed individually. When the first<br>
compound 7 and the second compound 9 are pulverized individually, the first<br>
compound 7 and the second compound 9 can be formed to have a desired<br>
secondary particle diameter, respectively. When the respective primary particle<br>
diameters of the first compound 7 and the second compound 9 are different from<br>
each other, a mixture of the first compound 7 and the second compound 9 that<br>
have different average diameters of the secondary particles may be obtained even<br>
 <br>
when the first compound 7 and the second compound 9 are pulverized integrally.<br>
Note that, when a fine raw material such as an oxide colloid is used as a raw<br>
material of the first compound 7 and/or the second compound 9, the pulverizing<br>
step may be omitted.<br>
When the first compound and the second compound are enclosed with the<br>
third compound after pulverization, it is preferable not to mix the enclosed first<br>
compound with the enclosed second compound, but to enclose the first<br>
compound and the second compound concurrently with the third compound.<br>
Accordingly, the first compound and the second compound can be dispersed<br>
uniformly without unevenness.<br>
More specifically, the first compound and the second compound are added<br>
to slurry in which a precursor of the third compound is dispersed, and the<br>
mixture is then stirred. When the slurry is stirred, the precursor of the third<br>
compound is adhered to the peripheries of the first compound and the second<br>
compound. At this time, the slurry is intensively stirred so that the respective<br>
particles are dispersed in the slurry. As a result, the degree of dispersion can be<br>
improved. Subsequently, the mixed slurry is dried and baked. Thus, the<br>
catalyst powder 5 in which the third compound is provided at the peripheries of<br>
the first compound 7 and the second compound 9 can be obtained.<br>
Thereafter, the catalyst powder 5 thus obtained is pulverized. The<br>
catalyst powder 5 may be subjected to either wet pulverization or dry<br>
pulverization. In general, the catalyst powder 5 is added to a solvent such as<br>
deionized water, and the mixture thus obtained is stirred and pulverized using a<br>
ball mill or the like, so as to obtain catalyst slurry. At this time, a binder is<br>
added to the catalyst slurry as necessary. An average particle diameter (D50) of<br>
the catalyst powder 5 in the catalyst slurry is preferably 6 urn or less as described<br>
above. Subsequently, the catalyst slurry is applied to the inner surface of the<br>
honeycomb substrate, followed by drying and baking. Thus, the exhaust gas<br>
 <br>
purifying catalyst can be obtained.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in more detail in<br>
accordance with examples and comparative examples. However, the present<br>
invention is not limited to these examples.<br>
Each catalyst powder of Examples 1 to 14 and Comparative Examples 1<br>
to 3 shown in Table 1, and each catalyst powder of Examples 15 to 18 shown in<br>
Table 2 were prepared, and then applied to the surface of the inner wall of a<br>
honeycomb substrate, respectively. The respective catalysts in the examples<br>
and the comparative examples shown in Table 1 and Table 2 were prepared as<br>
follows.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
(Example 1)<br>
First compound powder of which a specific surface area was<br>
approximately 70 m2/g was impregnated with a solution of rhodium nitrate in<br>
such a manner that a supporting concentration of rhodium was 1.0 wt%. The<br>
material thus obtained was dried at 150 °C throughout the day, and then baked at<br>
400 °C for one hour. Thus, a first compound of which the rhodium-supporting<br>
concentration was 1.0 wt% was obtained. The rhodium-supporting first<br>
compound thus obtained was pulverized so as to have an average particle<br>
diameter (D50) as shown in Table 1. The average particle diameter was<br>
measured by use of a laser diffraction/scattering particle size distribution<br>
analyzer LA-920 manufactured by Horiba Ltd.<br>
At the same time, second compound powder of which a specific surface<br>
area was 80 m~/g was pulverized so as to have an average particle diameter<br>
(D50) as shown in Table 1. The average particle diameter was measured by use<br>
of the same apparatus as in the case of the first compound.<br>
Next, boehmite used for a precursor of a third compound, nitric acid and<br>
water were mixed, and stirred for one hour, so as to prepare precursor slurry.<br>
Then, the Rh-supporting first compound after pulverization and the second<br>
compound after pulverization were respectively added slowly to the precursor<br>
slurry thus obtained, followed by stirring for additional two hours by use of a<br>
high-speed stirrer, so as to obtain mixed slurry. Thereafter, the mixed slurry<br>
thus obtained was dried rapidly, further dried at 150 °C throughout the day to<br>
remove moisture, and then baked at 550 °C for three hours in air. Thus, catalyst<br>
powder of Example 1 was obtained.<br>
Subsequently. 225 g of the catalyst powder, 25 g of alumina sol. 230 g of<br>
water, and 10 g of nitric acid were put into a magnetic ball mill and then mixed,<br>
so as to obtain catalyst slurry.<br>
 <br>
In addition to the catalyst slurry, Pt-supporting A12O3 catalyst powder and<br>
Ce-Zr-Ox powder were preliminarily mixed, so as to obtain slurry in the same<br>
manner as the catalyst slurry. The slurry thus obtained was applied to a<br>
cordierite monolithic substrate (0.12 L, 400 cells), and redundant slurry in the<br>
cells was then removed by flowing air. Subsequently, the substrate was dried at<br>
130 °C and then baked at 400 °C for one hour. Thus, a catalyst substrate coated<br>
with 100 g/L of the Pt-supporting Al2O3 catalyst powder and the Ce-Zr-Ox<br>
powder in total was prepared.<br>
Thereafter, the catalyst slurry was applied to the catalyst substrate coated<br>
with Pt, and redundant slurry in the cells was removed by flowing air. The<br>
substrate was then dried at 130 °C and baked at 400 °C for one hour. Thus, a<br>
catalyst coated with 50 g/L of the catalyst layer containing Rh provided on the<br>
100 g/L of the catalyst layer containing Pt was obtained.<br>
(Example 2)<br>
The Rh-supporting concentration in the first compound powder in<br>
Example 1 was adjusted to 1.4 wt% in Example 2. In addition, a weight ratio of<br>
the total amount of the first compound powder and the second compound powder<br>
to the third compound (Al2O3) was adjusted to 50:50. The material<br>
compositions of the first compound and the second compound were determined<br>
as shown in Table 1. The catalyst was thus obtained in the same manner as<br>
Example 1 except for the above-described processes. In the catalyst of<br>
Example 2, yttrium (Y) is contained in the second compound in order to improve<br>
heat resistance of the second compound.<br>
(Examples 3 to 12)<br>
The catalysts of Examples 3 to 12 were obtained in the same manner as<br>
Example 1, except that the material compositions of the first compound and the<br>
second compound and the secondary particle diameters were changed as shown<br>
in Table 1. In the catalyst of Example 7, neodymium (Nd) is contained in the<br>
 <br>
second compound, and in the catalyst of Example 12, yttrium (Y) is contained in<br>
the second compound, in order to improve heat resistance of the respective<br>
second compounds.<br>
(Example 13)<br>
In Example 13, composite oxide colloid with a primary particle diameter<br>
of 21 nm was used in the first compound, and composite oxide colloid with a<br>
primary particle diameter of 65 nm was used in the second compound.<br>
Rhodium was supported only on the first compound. Then, the catalyst of<br>
Example 13 was obtained in the same manner as Example 1, except that the<br>
pulverization step of the first compound on which rhodium was supported was<br>
omitted, and the first compound and the second compound were mixed with the<br>
precursor slurry.<br>
(Example 14)<br>
The catalyst of Example 14 was obtained in the same manner as Example<br>
1. except that commercially available silica sol was used instead of boehmite<br>
slurry used for the precursor of the third compound at the time of the preparation<br>
of the catalyst slurry in Example 1. The secondary particle diameter and the<br>
other numerical values of this example are as shown in Table 1.<br>
(Comparative Example 1)<br>
Comparative Example 1 is an example in which the OSC material is<br>
contained not in the catalyst powder, but in the catalyst layer formed on the<br>
monolithic substrate.<br>
First compound powder of which a specific surface area was<br>
approximately 70 m /g was impregnated with a solution of rhodium nitrate in<br>
such a manner that a supporting concentration of rhodium was 1.0 wt%. The<br>
material thus obtained was dried at 150 °C throughout the day, and then baked at<br>
400 °C for one hour. Thus, a first compound of which the rhodium-supporting<br>
concentration was 1.0 wt% was obtained. The rhodium-supporting first<br>
 <br>
compound thus obtained was pulverized so as to have an average particle<br>
diameter (D50) as shown in Table 1. The average particle diameter was<br>
measured by use of the same apparatus as in the case of Example 1.<br>
At the same time, boehmite, nitric acid and water were mixed, and stirred<br>
for one hour, so as to prepare precursor slurry. Then, the Rh-supporting first<br>
compound after pulverization was added slowly to the precursor slurry thus<br>
obtained, followed by stirring for additional two hours by use of a high-speed<br>
stirrer, so as to obtain mixed slurry. Thereafter, the mixed slurry thus obtained<br>
was dried rapidly, further dried at 150 °C throughout the day to remove moisture,<br>
and then baked at 550 °C for three hours in air. Thus, catalyst powder of<br>
Comparative Example 1 was obtained.<br>
Subsequently, 125 g of the catalyst powder, 100 g of Zr-Ce-Ox powder, 25<br>
g of alumina sol, 230 g of water, and 10 g of nitric acid were put into a magnetic<br>
ball mill and then mixed, so as to obtain catalyst slurry.<br>
In addition to the catalyst slurry, Pt-supporting Al2O3 catalyst powder and<br>
Ce-Zr-Ox powder were preliminarily mixed, so as to obtain slurry in the same<br>
manner as the catalyst slurry. The slurry thus obtained was applied to a<br>
cordierite monolithic substrate (0.12 L, 400 cells), and redundant slurry in the<br>
cells was then removed by flowing air. Subsequently, the substrate was dried at<br>
130 °C and baked at 400 °C for one hour. Thus, a catalyst substrate coated with<br>
100 g/L of the Pt-supporting Al2O3 catalyst powder and the Ce-Zr-Ox powder in<br>
total was prepared.<br>
Thereafter, the catalyst slurry was applied to the catalyst substrate coated<br>
with Pt, and redundant slurry in the cells was removed by flowing air. The<br>
substrate was then dried at 130 °C and baked at 400 °C for one hour. Thus, a<br>
catalyst coated with 50 g/L of the catalyst layer containing Rh provided on the<br>
100 g/L of the catalyst layer containing Pt was obtained.<br>
(Comparative Example 2)<br>
 <br>
Comparative Example 2 is an example in which the first compound and<br>
the second compound are covered with the third compound not simultaneously<br>
but individually. The degree of dispersion of the catalyst in Comparative<br>
Example 2 is a value of the powder obtained in such a manner that the first<br>
compound is enclosed with the third compound.<br>
First compound powder of which a specific surface area was<br>
approximately 70 m2/g was impregnated with a solution of rhodium nitrate in<br>
such a manner that a supporting concentration of rhodium was 1.0 wt%. The<br>
material thus obtained was dried at 150 °C throughout the day, and then baked at<br>
400 °C for one hour. Thus, a first compound of which the rhodium-supporting<br>
concentration was 1.0 wt% was obtained. The rhodium-supporting first<br>
compound thus obtained was pulverized so as to have an average particle<br>
diameter (D50) as shown in Table 1. The average particle diameter was<br>
measured by use of the same apparatus as in the case of Example 1.<br>
At the same time, boehmite, nitric acid and water were mixed, and stirred<br>
for one hour, so as to prepare precursor slurry. Then, the Rh-supporting first<br>
compound after pulverization was added slowly to the precursor slurry thus<br>
obtained, followed by stirring for additional two hours by use of a high-speed<br>
stirrer, so as to obtain mixed slurry. Thereafter, the mixed slurry thus obtained<br>
was dried rapidly, further dried at 150 °C throughout the day to remove moisture,<br>
and then baked at 550 °C for three hours in air. Thus, a catalyst powder raw<br>
material A of Comparative Example 2 was obtained.<br>
In addition, second compound powder was pulverized, so as to have an<br>
average particle diameter (D50) as shown in Table 1. The average particle<br>
diameter was measured by use of the same apparatus as in the case of Example 1.<br>
In addition to the catalyst powder raw material A, boehmite. nitric acid<br>
and water were mixed, and stirred for one hour, so as to prepare precursor slurry.<br>
Then, the second compound after pulverization was added slowly to the<br>
 <br>
precursor slurry thus obtained, followed by stirring for additional two hours by<br>
use of a high-speed stirrer, so as to obtain mixed slurry. Thereafter, the mixed<br>
slurry thus obtained was dried rapidly, further dried at 150 °C throughout the day<br>
to remove moisture, and then baked at 550 °C for three hours in air. Thus, a<br>
catalyst powder raw material B of Comparative Example 2 was obtained.<br>
Subsequently, 125 g of the catalyst powder raw material A, 100 g of the<br>
catalyst powder raw material B, 25 g of alumina sol, 230 g of water, and 10 g of<br>
nitric acid were put into a magnetic ball mill and then mixed, so as to obtain<br>
catalyst slurry.<br>
In addition to the catalyst slurry, Pt-supporting Al2O3 catalyst powder and<br>
Ce-Zr-Ox powder were preliminarily mixed, so as to obtain slurry in the same<br>
manner as the catalyst slurry. The slurry thus obtained was applied to a<br>
cordierite monolithic substrate (0.12 L, 400 cells), and redundant slurry in the<br>
cells was then removed by flowing air. Subsequently, the substrate was dried at<br>
130 °C and baked at 400 °C for one hour. Thus, a catalyst substrate coated with<br>
100 g/L of the Pt-supporting Al2O3 catalyst powder and the Ce-Zr-Ox powder in<br>
total was prepared.<br>
Thereafter, the catalyst slurry was applied to the catalyst substrate coated<br>
with Pt, and redundant slurry in the cells was removed by flowing air. The<br>
substrate was then dried at 130 °C and baked at 400 °C for one hour. Thus, a<br>
catalyst coated with 50 g/L of the catalyst layer containing Rh provided on the<br>
100 g/L of the catalyst layer containing Pt was obtained.<br>
(Comparative Example 3)<br>
Comparative Example 3 is an example in which the second compound is<br>
not included, and the noble metal particles are supported on the first compound<br>
having an oxygen storage capacity.<br>
First compound powder of which a specific surface area was<br>
approximately 70 m2/g was impregnated with a solution of rhodium nitrate in<br>
 <br>
such a manner that a supporting concentration of rhodium was 1.0 wt%. The<br>
material thus obtained was dried at 150 °C throughout the day, and then baked at<br>
400 °C for one hour. Thus, a first compound of which the rhodium-supporting<br>
concentration was 1.0 wt% was obtained. The rhodium-supporting first<br>
compound thus obtained was pulverized so as to have an average particle<br>
diameter (D50) as shown in Table 1. The average particle diameter was<br>
measured by use of the same apparatus as in the case of Example 1.<br>
At the same time, boehmite, nitric acid and water were mixed, and stirred<br>
for one hour, so as to prepare precursor slurry. Then, the Rh-supporting first<br>
compound after pulverization was added slowly to the precursor slurry thus<br>
obtained, followed by stirring for additional two hours by use of a high-speed<br>
stirrer, so as to obtain mixed slurry. Thereafter, the mixed slurry thus obtained<br>
was dried rapidly, further dried at 150 °C throughout the day to remove moisture,<br>
and then baked at 550 °C for three hours in air. Thus, catalyst powder of<br>
Comparative Example 3 was obtained.<br>
Subsequently, 125 g of the catalyst powder, 100 g of Al2O3 powder, 25 g<br>
of alumina sol, 230 g of water, and 10 g of nitric acid were put into a magnetic<br>
ball mill and then mixed, so as to obtain catalyst slurry.<br>
In addition to the catalyst slurry, Pt-supporting Al2O3 catalyst powder and<br>
Ce-Zr-Ox powder were preliminarily mixed, so as to obtain slurry in the same<br>
manner as the catalyst slurry. The slurry thus obtained was applied to a<br>
cordierite monolithic substrate (0.12 L, 400 cells), and redundant slurry in the<br>
cells was then removed by flowing air. Subsequently, the substrate was dried at<br>
130 °C and baked at 400 °C for one hour. Thus, a catalyst substrate coated with<br>
100 g/L of the Pt-supporting Al2O3 catalyst powder and the Ce-Zr-Ox powder in<br>
total was prepared.<br>
Thereafter, the catalyst slurry was applied to the catalyst substrate coated<br>
with Pt, and redundant slurry in the cells was removed by flowing air. The<br>
 <br>
substrate was then dried at 130 °C and baked at 400 °C for one hour. Thus, a<br>
catalyst coated with 50 g/L of the catalyst layer containing Rh provided on the<br>
100 g/L of the catalyst layer containing Pt was obtained.<br>
(Examples 15 to 18)<br>
In Example 15, the preliminarily prepared catalyst substrate including the<br>
catalyst layer containing Pt used in Example 1 was subjected to the following<br>
treatment, so that Ba was contained in the catalyst layer containing Pt. That is,<br>
the catalyst substrate coated with Pt was impregnated for a predetermined period<br>
of time with a solution in which pure water and an aqueous solution of barium<br>
acetate (40 wt% concentration) were mixed, followed by removing moisture and<br>
drying at 400 °C for one hour. Thus, a catalyst substrate including the catalyst<br>
layer containing Pt and Ba was prepared. The other steps are the same as in the<br>
case of Example 1.<br>
In Examples 16 to 18, Ba, Mg and Na as a NOx adsorbing material were<br>
respectively contained in the first compound and/or the second compound.<br>
[Evaluation 1]<br>
Among the respective examples and comparative examples, Examples 1<br>
to 14 and Comparative Examples 1 to 3 were subjected to durability testing<br>
treatment, and then a NOx conversion rate of the respective examples were<br>
measured. As a method of the durability testing treatment, the catalyst was<br>
installed in an exhaust system of a 3500 cc-gasoline engine, an inlet temperature<br>
of the catalyst was adjusted to 800 °C, and the engine was continuously operated<br>
for 50 hours. The fuel used was unleaded gasoline. The NOx conversion rate<br>
was measured according to the mathematical formula (3), while the catalyst was<br>
installed in the exhaust system of a 3500 cc-gasoline engine, and the inlet<br>
temperature of the catalyst was adjusted to 400 °C.<br>

_ (NOxconcentraion at catalystinlet)- (NOxconcentraion at cataly stoutlet)<br>
(NOxconcentraion at catalystinlet)<br>
The distance between the first compound and the second compound in the<br>
respective examples was measured by use of a TEM-EDX analyzer (HF-2000,<br>
manufactured by Hitachi, Ltd.). An accelerating voltage in this evaluation was<br>
adjusted to 200 kV. The cutting condition by an ultramicrotome was set at a<br>
room temperature. The outlines of the first compound and the second<br>
compound were extracted from the images obtained by the TEM-EDX analyzer<br>
using an image analyzer (KS-400, manufactured by Carl Zeiss Co., Ltd.).<br>
Thereafter, the areas of the first compound and the second compound were<br>
calculated based on the extracted outlines, circular approximation and each<br>
central point were defined, and the detection of the closest central points and the<br>
measurement of the distance were carried out. Thus, the distance between the<br>
first compound and the second compound was obtained. In addition, the degree<br>
of dispersion of the catalyst was obtained according to the above-described<br>
formula.<br>
Table 1 shows the NOx conversion rate after the durability testing<br>
treatment of the respective catalysts in Examples 1 to 14 and Comparative<br>
Examples 1 to 3, in addition to the distance between the first compound and the<br>
second compound and the degree of dispersion of the catalyst in the respective<br>
examples.<br>
In Example 1, the average distance between the first compound and the<br>
second compound was 135 nm. The ratio of the amount of the oxygen storage<br>
component (mol) in the first compound to the amount of the oxygen storage<br>
component (mol) in the second compound exceeded 100. The average diameter<br>
of the secondary particles of the first compound was 135 nm, and the average<br>
diameter of the secondary particles of the second compound was 220 nm. The<br>
 <br>
average particle diameter of the catalyst powder containing the noble metal<br>
particles was 2.7 µm, and the degree of dispersion was 56%. In the exhaust gas<br>
purifying test, the NOx conversion rate of Example 1 showed an excellent<br>
purifying performance as high as 93%.<br>
In Example 2, the first compound supporting the noble metal particles has<br>
an oxygen storage capacity since the first compound contains cerium in addition<br>
to zirconium as a main component. The average distance between the first<br>
compound and the second compound in Example 2 was 145 nm. The ratio of<br>
the amount of the oxygen storage component (mol) in the first compound to the<br>
amount of the oxygen storage component (mol) in the second compound was 2.9.<br>
In addition, the NOx conversion rate of Example 2 showed an excellent purifying<br>
performance as high as 97%.<br>
In Example 3, since the first compound and the second compound are the<br>
identical compounds, the ratio of the amount (mol) of the oxygen storage<br>
component in the first compound to the amount (mol) of the oxygen storage<br>
component in the second compound is 1.0. Therefore, the amount of Ce in the<br>
first compound is relatively high. As a result, Rh is in a high oxidation state.<br>
Accordingly, Example 1 had a higher purifying performance than Example 3.<br>
In Example 4, the secondary particle diameter of the first compound was<br>
as large as 350 nm. However, since the first compound was enclosed with the<br>
third compound, the aggregation was stopped and not promoted more than that.<br>
As a result, a high purifying performance was ensured.<br>
In Example 5, the particle diameter of the catalyst powder was as large as<br>
7.0 µm. Therefore, the gas diffusion performance in the catalyst powder was<br>
decreased. Accordingly, the purifying performance in Example 5 was<br>
decreased compared with Example 1.<br>
In Example 6. since the agitation of the slurry was stopped before the<br>
drying step of the mixed slurry, the degree of dispersion was decreased to 25%.<br>
 <br>
As a result, the particle aggregation of the first compound and the second<br>
compound was occurred after the durability test. Accordingly, the purifying<br>
performance in Example 6 was decreased compared with Example 1.<br>
In Example 7, praseodymium was applied to the OSC material of the<br>
second compound, and an excellent purifying performance, substantially the<br>
same as Example 1, was shown in Example 7.<br>
In Examples 8 to 11, the second compound further contained various<br>
types of transition metal elements. Since the second compound was an oxide<br>
containing those transition metal elements, active oxygen was supplied, and as a<br>
result, a purifying performance was improved.<br>
In Example 14, SiO2 was used as the third compound. The conversion<br>
rate in Example 14 was lower than the respective conversion rates in Examples 1<br>
to 13 in which Al2O3 was used as the third compound. However, the purifying<br>
performance was improved compared with Comparative Example 1.<br>
In Comparative Example 1, the powder obtained in such a manner that the<br>
first compound was covered with the third compound, and the Zr-Ce-Ox powder<br>
used in Example 1 were mixed in the catalyst layer. In Comparative Example 1,<br>
since the Zr-Ce-Ox powder as an OSC material was not enclosed with the third<br>
compound, the particle aggregation of the Zr-Ce-Ox powder because of a crystal<br>
growth was promoted after the durability test. In addition, there was a long<br>
distance between the first compound supporting the noble metal particles and the<br>
OSC material. As a result, the catalytic performance in Comparative Example 1<br>
was decreased compared with the respective examples.<br>
In Comparative Example 2, the first compound and the second compound<br>
were separately covered with the third compound. The degree of dispersion of<br>
the catalyst of Comparative Example 2 is a value of the powder obtained in such<br>
a manner that the first compound is enclosed with the third compound. The<br>
catalyst of Comparative Example 2 ensures an improved performance that was<br>
 <br>
achieved due to the prevention of aggregation of the noble metal particles<br>
compared with Comparative Example 1, since the first compound supporting the<br>
noble metal particles was enclosed with the third compound. However, there<br>
was a long distance between the first compound and the second compound, and<br>
the purifying performance was decreased, compared with the catalysts of<br>
Example 1 and the other examples.<br>
In Comparative Example 3, the catalyst did not include the second<br>
compound, and all the Rh particles were present on the first compound<br>
(Zr-Ce(30)-Ox). In the catalyst of Comparative Example 3, the Rh particles and<br>
the first compound were detected in the same site on the TEM-EDX. However,<br>
since the diameter of EDX beam is 2 nm, the distance between them is<br>
determined to be 2 nm or less. In the catalyst of Comparative Example 3, since<br>
the Rh particles were supported on the first compound having an oxygen storage<br>
capacity, the Rh particles were in a high oxidation state, and the catalytic<br>
performance was decreased.<br>
Next, the catalysts manufactured in such a manner that each degree of<br>
dispersion was purposely changed in the manufacturing process were subjected<br>
to a catalytic performance evaluation. Fig. 6 shows a relationship between the<br>
degree of dispersion and the NOx conversion rate with regard to the four<br>
catalysts of Example 6, Example 12, Example 2 and Example 10, each having<br>
different degrees of dispersion. According to Fig. 6, when the degree of<br>
dispersion is 40% or more, particle aggregation is suppressed since the<br>
dispersion of the distance between the first compound and the second compound<br>
is decreased. As a result, the purifying performance is improved.<br>
In addition, the catalysts, each of which had a different average distance<br>
between the first compound and the second compound, were subjected to the<br>
catalytic performance evaluation. Fig. 7 shows a relationship between the<br>
average distance and the NOx conversion rate with regard to the respective<br>
 <br>
catalysts of Comparative Example 1, Comparative Example 2, Example 4,<br>
Example 13 and Comparative Example 3. According to Fig. 7, when the<br>
average distance between the first compound and the second compound is within<br>
a range of 5 nm to 300 nm, active oxygen is effectively supplied to the noble<br>
metal particles from the OSC material, and an excessive supply of active oxygen<br>
can be prevented. Accordingly, the NOx purifying performance can be<br>
improved.<br>
[Evaluation 2]<br>
Next, by use of the respective catalysts of Examples 15 to 18 shown in<br>
Table 2, the purifying performance was evaluated under the condition of the<br>
atmosphere shifting from a lean atmosphere to a rich atmosphere based on the<br>
assumption that the respective catalysts were applied to a lean burn engine.<br>
This evaluation was carried out under the condition that each catalyst was<br>
installed in an exhaust system of a 3500 cc-gasoline engine, an inlet temperature<br>
of the catalyst was adjusted to 700 °C, and the engine was subjected to durability<br>
testing treatment of a 50-hour operation. Then, the catalyst after the durability<br>
testing treatment was installed in an exhaust system of a 2000 cc-gasoline engine,<br>
the inlet temperature of the catalyst was adjusted to 300 to 350 °C, and the<br>
engine was operated while the atmosphere was shifted from a lean condition for<br>
40 seconds to a rich condition for 2 seconds. Thus, the exhaust gas purification<br>
rate (the NOx conversion rate) in this range was obtained. The air-fuel ratio<br>
(A/F) in the lean atmosphere was 25, and the air-fuel ratio in the rich atmosphere<br>
was 11. The formula for calculation of the NOx conversion rate is the same as<br>
that described above. In addition, the distance between the first compound and<br>
the second compound and the degree of dispersion of the respective examples<br>
were measured in the same manner as Examples 11 to 14.<br>
The NOx conversion rate of the respective catalysts is indicated in Table 2<br>
as well as the distance between the first compound and the second compound, the<br>
 <br>
degree of dispersion of the respective catalysts, and the like.<br>
As is clear from Table 2, the NOx conversion rate was significantly<br>
improved in Examples 16 to 18 in which barium (Ba), magnesium (Mg) and<br>
sodium (Na) were respectively contained as a NOx adsorbing material in the first<br>
 compound and/or the second compound, compared with Example 15 in which<br>
these elements were not contained in the first compound and/or the second<br>
compound.<br>
