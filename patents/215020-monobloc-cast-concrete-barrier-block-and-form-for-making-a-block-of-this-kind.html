				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention concerns a monobloc cast concrete barrier block for structures protecting coastal and riverside structures against waves and currents, and a form for making a block of this kind.<br>
The technical characteristics required of artificial blocks are hydraulic stability and strength.<br>
Over and above these technical characteristics, the aim of block designers is to reduce the volume of concrete required for a given barrier while assuring the stability and the strength appropriate to their use. To this end designers vary the dimensions and the angles of the constituent parts of the block in order to increase the volume of the empty spaces between interlocked blocks.<br>
Designers tend to modify the dimensions and the general shape of the legs or anvils from which the block is constructed in such way as to generate a high level of interlocking with more empty spaces in the interlocking of blocks. In this connection, the block from document US-A-4 347 017 dating from the 1980s may be usefully compared with the more slender block of the more recent document US-A-5 441 362. Moreover, with the aim of reducing the volume of concrete in each block, the shapes of the blocks are more slender.<br>
A consequence of this is that the legs of the longer-limbed blocks are more fragile.<br>
The resulting blocks offer a non-negligible saving of concrete. They are not so strong, however, and for this reason gaps may in due course appear in the coverage of the barrier due to broken blocks settling, uncovering part of the coastal or riverside structures, possibly leading to damage.<br>
NL-A-8903138  discloses  a  cast  concrete  barrier<br>
block. The aim of this document is to compensate the fragility of the blocks with an arrangement comprising a covering layer reducing impact loads.<br>
The covering layer has less resistance to fracture on impact than the block, or can be less rigid, the layer can be of asphalt, or a mixture of cement, elastomer and/or other plastic.<br>
The covering layer can be provided with geometrically regular shaped bosses or ribs. These can be of concrete, wood, elastomer or plastics.<br>
The thought basis leading to the present invention is completely different. It is built on an improvement of the index of interlocking between blocks and the index of hydraulic stability of the barrier for limiting the motion between the blocs<br>
One of the aims of the present invention is to retain the optimal dimensional ratios of existing blocks and to provide an irregular rough block surface constituting a plurality of asperities without affecting its structural strength. The irregular rough block surface provides an isotropic improvement of the index of interlocking between blocks.<br>
In this respect the present invention goes entirely against the general idea that monobloc cast concrete barrier blocks must have a smooth cast exterior skin to facilitate fabrication and in particular removal of the form. All monobloc cast concrete barrier blocks used until now have had a smooth cast surface, with eventually, like in NL-A-8903138, a built-up covering layer.<br>
Furthermore, geometrically regular shaped bosses or ribs provided on the NL-A-8903138 built-up covering layer are not providing an isotropic improvement of the index of interlocking between blocks.<br>
To this end the invention relates to a monobloc<br>
cast concrete barrier block for structures for protecting coastal and riverside structures having an exterior surface the overall shape of which defines a smooth polyhedron. In accordance with the invention, at least some of the exterior surface of the block has integral protuberances and/or grooves formed with the block, the protuberances and/or the grooves having faces in planes intersecting the local general plane of the smooth polyhedron, and the protuberances and/or the grooves providing, altogether, an irregular rough surface.<br>
The irregular rough surface increases the index of interlocking between blocks in all directions (isotropic) and therefore increases the index of hydraulic stability. As the index of interlocking is increased, the inertia of the individual blocks (the mass of concrete used for each block) may be reduced, the reduced mass of each block being compensated by the better interlocking between blocks. This leads to a saving in concrete to construct a given area of barrier.<br>
The faces of the protuberances and/or grooves are secondary planes with different orientations that multiply the possibilities of stable plane-to-plane contact between blocks compared to the smooth surfaces of the prior art.<br>
This multiplication of the possibilities of stable plane-to-plane contact between blocks leads to an increase in the volume of the empty spaces between blocks.<br>
Furthermore, the protuberances and/or grooves being formed with the block, the mechanical behaviour of the block is maintained, and the resulting irregular rough surface has a resistance to the shearing stress greater than a built-up covering layer.<br>
Because of this, the same number of blocks produces a barrier of greater area retaining a group effect<br>
comparable to that of the prior art.<br>
Environmental considerations are increasingly requiring artificial structures to be integrated as fully as possible into their natural environment. Smooth-skinned monobloc cast concrete barrier blocks do not meet these criteria and degrade sites on which they are used. This makes it necessary to use natural rocks obtained from quarries. Quarrying is also an activity governed by strict regulations and the transportation of natural rocks of adequate size has a deleterious effect (vehicle movements, noise, pollution, provision of access infrastructure, etc).<br>
It is therefore another object of the present invention to propose monobloc cast concrete barrier blocks in accordance with the invention having integral protuberances and/or grooves, with an overall shape (geomorphism) similar to the overall shape of the natural asperities of the type of rock at the site where they are installed.<br>
To this end the invention concerns a monobloc cast concrete barrier block, having integral protuberances and/or grooves formed with the block, disposed at a place having a given geomorphism. In accordance with the invention, the integral protuberances and/or grooves have an overall geomorphism substantially equivalent to the geomorphism of the asperities of the place in question.<br>
Apart from the general advantages of blocks of the invention, an advantage of blocks having this feature is that they can replace the natural rock without degrading the site and with limited constraints in connection with the procurement of natural rocks and their conveyance to the site.<br>
The concrete from which the block is made may advantageously be coloured to match the geological environment of the place concerned.<br>
The invention also concerns a form for making a block in accordance with the invention.<br>
Other advantages and features of the present invention will emerge from the following description with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:<br>
Figures 1A through 1C are diagrammatic views of a block of the invention.<br>
Figures 2A through 2D are diagrammatic views of one embodiment of a block of the invention with a granite-like geomorphism.<br>
Figures 3A through 3D are diagrammatic views of one embodiment of a block of the invention with a basalt-like geomorphism.<br>
The blocks shown by way of example are blocks having the same smooth polyhedron overall shape as the blocks of US-A-4 347 017, but these examples used as illustrations in the description are in no way limiting on the basic type of block according to the invention.<br>
The invention concerns a monobloc cast concrete barrier block 1 for structures for protecting coastal and riverside structures.<br>
The block 1 is made up of legs 2 mutually arranged with given angles and distances between the legs.<br>
The block 1 has an exterior surface 6 the overall profile of which defines a smooth polyhedron 3. The term smooth polyhedron 3 refers to the smooth surface of the exterior envelope of the block. In the prior art this smooth polyhedron corresponds to the untreated exterior surface of the block on removing the form.<br>
In accordance with the invention, at least some of the exterior surface 6 has integral protuberances 4 and/or grooves 5 relative to the smooth polyhedron 3. This protuberances 4 and/or grooves 5 are formed with the block.<br>
Surface defects resulting from removing a prior art<br>
smooth form do not constitute the protuberances 4 and/or grooves 5 of a Block 1 in accordance with the present invention.<br>
For a block 1 of the invention the smooth polyhedron 3 of the block 1 is an imaginary polyhedron corresponding to the exterior surface of an equivalent block such as would have been cast in a smooth form.<br>
The protuberances 4 and/or the grooves 5 are due to grooves and/or protuberances deliberately formed in the form (not shown) for casting the block 1.<br>
The form (not shown) may advantageously be the smooth form for the equivalent smooth-skinned block to which are added protruding members comprising grooves or generating grooves between them, so that when the concrete is cast in the form, grooves 5 and protuberances 4 are formed on the block 1.<br>
It will be realised that, whilst conforming to the optimal proportions of an equivalent smooth block, the unit volume of concrete required to make a block 1 of the invention is reduced by the volume of the protruding members added to the form, these protruding members creating grooves 5 and protuberances 4 on the block 1 which, because of the increased index of interlocking, compensate the reduced unit mass of the block 1 compared to its smooth counterpart.<br>
The protuberances 4 and or/grooves 5 have faces in planes intersecting the local planes of the smooth polyhedron and provide altogether an irregular rough surface. This significantly increases the number of planes in which the interlocked blocks 1 are likely to be in stable bearing engagement with each other. The resulting interlocking produces larger empty spaces between blocks than with smooth-skinned blocks, whilst preserving the group effect of the barrier.<br>
Figures 2A-2D and 3A-3D show two examples of blocks<br>
in accordance with the invention in which the protuberances 4 and/or the grooves 5 have a geomorphism similar to that of granite and basalt, respectively. In this way, the blocks of the invention integrate into the site on which they are installed without degrading it.<br>
The geomorphic block may advantageously be self-coloured with a colour similar to the geological colours of the installation site.<br>
The form of the present invention may advantageously be a modified smooth form. A modified form of this kind may be made in the following steps:<br>
A geometrically similar smooth block having a smaller volume than the smooth form to be modified is made so that there is a gap between the form to be modified and the block.<br>
In a first embodiment the protuberances and the grooves are sculpted directly on the block; the sculpted block is then held centred in the form and a casting material is cast between the sculpted block and the smooth wall of the form. This produces a cast of the block perfectly integrated into the smooth form to be modified.<br>
In a second embodiment the smooth block is coated with an easily worked material in which the protuberances and the grooves are shaped; the block with the shaped exterior layer is then held centred in the form and a casting material is cast between the block with the shaped exterior layer and the smooth wall of the form. This produces a cast of the block perfectly integrated into the smooth form to be modified.<br>
Of course, the invention is not limited to the embodiments described and shown, but is open to numerous variants that will suggest themselves to the person skilled in the art but that do not depart from the scope of the invention. In particular, without departing from<br>
the scope of the invention, the smooth basic block may be replaced with any other type of block known in itself. Likewise, without departing from the scope of the invention, the blocks may have a geomorphism resembling natural geomorphisms other than that of granite or basalt.<br><br><br><br><br>
