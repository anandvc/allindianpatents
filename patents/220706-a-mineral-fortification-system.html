				<td>MINERAL FORTIFICATION SYSTEMS FOR ADDING MINERALS TO BOTTLED, POTABLE LIQUIDS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to mineral fortification systems comprising a powdered mineral fortification composition contained within a cap that can be attached to a bottle of liquid. After the cap is attached, the minerals can be released from the cap allowing the minerals to mix with and fortify the bottled liquid. The mineral used in the present fortification systems include minerals such as calcium, iron, zinc, copper, manganese, iodine, magnesium, and mixtures thereof, or mixtures of two or more of these compounds that have excellent bioavailability. The resulting fortified liquid containing the minerals, especially iron and zinc compounds, does not have an off-flavor/aftertaste, is stable, and overcomes the problem of discoloration, precipitation and/or poor bioavailability caused by the addition of these minerals to a liquid. The compositions can also optionally include vitamins, and other nutrients.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In many countries, the average diet does not contain sufficient levels of necessary minerals and nutrients, such as, iron, zinc, iodine, vitamin A or the B vitamins. Iron deficiency is well documented. Iron deficiency is one of the few nutritional deficiencies hi the U.S., and it is common in most developing countries. Recent evidence suggests that nutritional zinc deficiency may be common among the people of many developing countries where they subsist on diets of plant origin (e.g. cereal and legume). Marginal mineral deficiencies may be widespread even in the U.S. because of self-imposed dietary restrictions, use of alcohol and cereal proteins, and the increasing use of refined foods that decrease the intake of trace minerals.<br>
Many mineral deficiencies can be overcome by taking supplements. Other methods of addressing these deficiencies include increasing the intake of foods naturally containing these minerals or fortifying food and beverage products. Usually, hi countries where the people suffer from these deficiencies, the economy is such that providing minerals and vitamins as a supplement is expensive and presents significant distribution logistics problems. In addition, compliance, i.e., having the people take the vitamin and mineral supplements on a daily basis, is a serious problem. Accordingly, the delivery of minerals along with other vitamins and nutrients in a form that has high bioavailability and at the same time a non-objectionable taste and appearance, and in a form that would be consumed by a high proportion of the population at risk is desirable.<br><br>
Vitamin and mineral fortified beverages and foods are known. Although substantial progress has been made in reducing iron deficiency by fortifying products such as infant formulas, breakfast cereals and chocolate drink powders, the formulations require milk that is<br><br>
often not available or affordable. To address the problem of iron and zinc deficiencies in the general population, efforts have been directed to formulating fruit-flavored dry beverage mixes supplemented with nutritional amounts (i.e., at least 5% of the USRDI) of zinc and iron with or without vitamins. Many fruit-flavored powdered beverages contain vitamins and/or minerals but seldom contain both zinc and iron at any significant level, see for example, Composition of Foods: Beverages, Agriculture Handbook No. 8 Series, Nutrition Monitoring Division, pgs 115-153.<br>
There are well-recognized problems associated with adding both vitamins and minerals to beverages. Zinc supplements tend to have an objectionable taste, cause distortion of taste and cause mouth irritation, see for example U.S. Patent 4,684,528 (Godfrey), issued August 4,1987. Iron supplements tend to discolor foodstuff, or to be organoleptically unsuitable. Moreover, it is particularly difficult to formulate products containing minerals and, in particular, mixtures of bioavailable iron and zinc. These minerals not only affects the organoleptic and aesthetic properties of beverages, but also undesirably affects the nutritional bioavailability of the minerals themselves and the stability of vitamins and flavors.<br>
Several problems exist with delivering a mixture of iron and zinc with or without vitamins in a beverage mix. A few of the problems are choosing iron and zinc compounds which are organoleptically acceptable, bioavailable, cost effective and safe. For example, the water soluble iron and zinc compounds, which are the most bioavailable cause unacceptable metallic aftertaste and flavor changes. In addition, the soluble iron complexes often cause unacceptable color changes. Even further, the iron complexes themselves are often colored. This makes formulating a dry powder that has a uniform color distribution in the mix more difficult. Often the reconstituted beverage does not have a suitable color identifiable with the flavoring agent If the color of the powder, reconstituted beverage or flavor of the beverage is substantially altered, the beverage will not be consumed. Color and taste are key to consumer acceptance.<br>
Many iron sources that have been successful commercially, have been found to be unsatisfactory for use herein. For example, U.S. Patent 4,786,578 (Nakel et al.), issued November 1988, relates to the use of iron-sugar complexes suitable for supplementing fruit beverages. While this supplement may produce an acceptable taste in certain fruit flavored beverages, the supplement causes discoloration and consumer detectable differences in some colored beverages. Iron sources typically used to fortify chocolate milk were also found undesirable due to color problems and/or flavor problems.<br><br>
It has further been found that iron is more bioavailable if administered in the form of chelates wherein the chelating ligands are amino acids or protein hydrolysates. See, for example, U.S. Patent 3,969,540 (Jensen), issued July 13, 1976 and U.S. Patent 4,020,158 (Ashmead), issued April 26,1977. These chelated iron compounds are known in the art by various names such as iron proteinates, iron amino acid chelates and peptide or polypeptide chelates. These will be referred to herein simply as "amino acid chelated irons." A particularly desirable amino acid chekted iron is FERROCHEL made by Albion Laboratories. FERROCHEL is a free flowing, fine granular powder that provides a high bioavailable source of ferrous iron that is typically complexed or chelated with the amino acid glycine.<br>
Unfortunately, it has also been found that FERROCHEL, when added to water or other aqueous solutions, imparts relatively quickly a deep rusty yellow color. Such a color can change the color appearance the food or beverage to which FERROCHEL has been added. In the case of many foods and beverages, this color change would be unacceptable. It has been found that FERROCHEL causes unacceptable off-color development hi various foods and beverages by interacting with dietary components such as the polyphenols and flavonoids. Furthermore, by accelerating the oxidative rancidity of fats and oils, FERROCHEL (like ferrous sulfate) has been found to cause off-flavor in foods and beverages.<br>
One solution to delivering a mineral-fortified beverage is disclosed in PCT Publication WO 98/48648 (The Procter &amp; Gamble Company), published November 5,1998, which teaches a dry free-flowing beverage composition that when reconstituted with water has a desirable color and is free of undesirable aftertaste. The dry free-flowing beverage composition contains from about 5% to about 100% of the USRDI of iron, optionally from about 5% to about 100% of the USRDI Of zinc, from about 0.001% to about 0.5% of a coloring agent, and from about 0.001% to about 10% of a flavoring agent An edible acid sufficient to lower the pH to between 3 and 4.5 in the finished beverage is added. As can be appreciated, some of the additives are nutrients, while others are used to mask the taste and off-color caused by adding minerals to an aqueous solution.<br>
An even greater challenge has been faced hi providing a mineral fortified drinking water that contains a bioavailable source of iron or zinc mineral. A drinking water, as opposed to a beverage, should contain water as its main ingredient, and which should have the taste and appearance of pure water. Fortification of drinking water with soluble, stable and bioavailable minerals (e. g. iron, zinc) has been a challenge. For instance, when the soluble form of iron (ferrous iron) is added to regular water, it rapidly oxidizes to the insoluble trivalent form, which is ferric iron. Subsequently, the ferric kon combines with hydroxide ions to form iron hydroxide (yellow colored), which later converts to ferric oxide, a red, powdery precipitate called "rust." Thus, it is well known fact that natural water not only oxidizes kon from ferrous to ferric<br><br>
moieties, but also causes (a) the development of undesirable color (yellowish-rusty), (b) poor solubility demonstrated by precipitation and increased turbidity, (c) compromised bioavailability and (b) co-precipitation of other minerals (e. g. zinc, magnesium, calcium) and phosphate.<br>
The behavior of such nutritionally important minerals in natural water (e. g. lakes, streams, rivers and oceans) is due to the oxidizing nature of the natural water. Most fresh water and lakes have a pH range from pH 5 to about 9. Furthermore, they contain not only dissolved oxygen but also other electron accepting species (iron-oxidizing) such as nitrates, manganese (IV), chloride ions. Both the pH range and the presence of the electron accepting species makes natural water an oxidizing media. Thus, it favors poor solubility, off-color development and compromised bioavailability and stability. In fact, the ability (tendency) of natural water to act as an oxidizing media is determined by measuring the Redox potential (Eh) hi millivolts (mV). The redox potential for the different species of iron is defined by (a) Eh-pH diagram and (b) Nernest's equation: Eh= Eo + 0.059/n log [oxidized species]/[reduced species], where Eh = observed electrode potential, Eo = standard electrode potential, n= number of electrons transferred. Under normal condition, water has relatively high redox potential (&gt;300 mV), which is an indicator of highly oxidizing environment. This is primarily due to the presence of various electron acceptors (oxidizing agents), which include ozone, chlorine, oxygen, nitrates and manganese (IV).<br>
Hence, there is a tendency for iron to turn rusty and precipitate as a result of the oxidizing nature of the water, and to develop a metallic off-taste that is attributed to free iron ions in the water. Since drinking waters should not have perceptible flavors or colors, the development of unacceptable iron coloration, poor solubility, or metallic taste hi a drinking water cannot be masked over.<br>
Attempts to provide an iron-containing drinking water hi the past have shown limited success. PR Patent publication 2,461,463, published February 6, 1981, discloses a procedure for preparing and stabilizing an iron-containing mineral water by adding an ascorbic acid, or salt thereof, reducing agent, where the weight ratio of ascorbic acid to ferrous ion is from about 2.5-6.5. The reducing agent is added to reduce any ferric ions to the ferrous state, which was believed to be the active bioavailable state of iron.<br>
Further, German Patent No. 19,628,575, published January 29, 1998, discloses drinking water or mineral water such as coffee, fruit teas or soft drinks, containing ferrous iron and an excess of organic or inorganic dietary acids to reduce the water pH to the range of 2-5. Iron gluconate and iron sulfate were disclosed as the added iron source. The resulting acid flavor of these waters was then neutralized by the addition of flavors, sugar and/or sweetener.<br><br>
The benefits provided by mineral fortified liquid compositions are clear, but providing these compositions to consumers presents many problems. Specifically, it is often not desirable or economical to prepare, bottle, ship, store and sell a fortified liquid. One such problem is that the minerals and other nutrients can promote the growth of undesirable bacteria and other microbials. Preservatives can be added to the liquid to slow this gradual contamination problem. But preservatives add cost and are often viewed by consumers as unnatural and therefore contradictory to the concept of drinking a healthy beverage. Thus, it would be far more desirable if the consumer of such a product could prepare the beverage themselves using their own liquid composition.<br>
Accordingly, there exists a need for a mineral fortification system that allows consumers to prepare a mineral fortified liquid composition near to the time and place that the mineral fortified liquid composition is to be consumed. This system should provide the mineral along with any necessary stabilizing compounds, such as a redox modulating composition, in an easily dispensable form. Preferably this form is compatible with a common bottle, such as a juice, water or milk bottle, allowing the consumer to combine the mineral fortification powder with a preexisting bottle of liquid. Or the bottle, liquid and powder could be sold together but unmixed so that the consumer can mix a fresh compositions at any desired time. It is preferred that the liquid compositions produced by the desired mineral fortification system have no metallic taste or aftertaste, without the use of any flavor or sweetener. Likewise, it is desired that these compositions have an acceptable clarity and color, and preferably they are clear and colorless. These and many more advantages are provided by the present invention.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In one aspect of the present invention there is provided a mineral-fortification system comprising:<br>
a)	A bottle cap comprising a pouch and a pouch opener;<br>
b)	A powder contained within the pouch, the powder comprising at least one mineral<br>
and a redox modulating compound.<br>
Further, when the cap is secured onto the opening of a bottle containing a liquid and when the pouch opener is activated, the powder is released from the pouch and mixes with the liquid to form a mineral fortified liquid composition. This composition is fortified with at least one mineral and has a pH between about 2.5 and 9.5, and the mineral fortified liquid composition has a redox potential that satisfies the following equation:<br><br>
In this equation, RP is the measured redox potential in millivolts of the mineral fortified liquid composition, pH is the pH of the mineral fortified liquid composition, A is 400 and B is 20, preferably, A is 380 and B is 18, more preferably A is 360 and B is 16, and even more preferably A is 340 and B 14. The mineral is preferably selected from the group consisting of calcium, iron, zinc, copper, manganese, iodine, magnesium, and mixtures thereof.<br>
In another aspect of the present invention there is provided a mineral-fortification system further comprising a bottle containing a liquid. Preferably, the liquid comprises at least about 90%, preferably at least about 95%, and more preferably at least about 99%, by weight, water.<br>
In a yet another aspect of the present invention there is provided a mineral-fortification system comprising a bottle cap comprising a pouch and a pouch opener wherein the pouch opener comprises a blade mat cuts into and opens the pouch when the cap is twisted onto a bottle. In another aspect the pouch opener comprises a plunger that opens the pouch when it is pressed down and through the pouch. Preferably, the cap further comprises a removable retaining ring that protects the pouch from being opened prematurely.<br>
In another aspect of the present invention the mineral-fortified liquid composition produced by the mineral fortification system of the present invention is substantially free of a flavor or sweetener compound, and has: no metallic taste or after-taste; a Hunter colorimetric "b" reading of less than 5.0; and an NTU turbidity value of less than 5.0, preferably less than 2.0. Preferably, the mineral is either water soluble or a water-dispersible compound having a dispersed particle size of less than about 100 nanometers.<br>
In yet another aspect of the present invention the mineral-fortified liquid composition may further comprise less than 4 ppm oxygen, preferably less than 3 ppm oxygen, and more preferably less than 2 ppm oxygen, and even more preferably an oxygen scavenging agent is provided. The mineral-fortified liquid composition may be substantially free of a redox potential increasing agent selected from an oxoanion salt, a halide gas and an organic material.<br>
La one preferred embodiment of the present invention the mineral-fortified liquid composition further comprises an additive selected from the group consisting of vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E, niacin, thiamin, vitamin B6, vitamin B2, vitamin B 12, folic acid, selenium, pantathonic acid, iodine and mixtures thereof.<br>
la yet another aspect of the present invention there is provided a packaged liquid, comprising: a mineral-fortified liquid composition according to the present invention; and an oxygen-barrier package.<br><br>
The inventors have surprisingly found that minerals, for example, ferrous ions (Fe2+), can be stabilized through redox modulation. The invention includes converting the natural water redox potential from "oxidizing/electron accepting" to "reducing/electron donating" by reducing the concentration of, and preferably eliminating, compounds/species that have higher redox potential than that of the added minerals. These include ozone, oxygen, hypochlorite, chlorine, nitrate/nitrite and manganese (TV).<br>
A system has been developed that incorporates the present redox modulation technology for stabilizing minerals in liquid compositions into a delivery system that allows the composition to be mixed and consumed fresh. This system is superior to other mineral fortification systems in that the consumer can prepare the fortified liquid by simply combining the cap, and mineral containing pouch with a bottle of liquid. The convenient pouch opener is used to open the pouch dispersing the mineral powder into the liquid. With a slight amount of agitation, the mineral-fortified liquid composition is made and ready to drink. The resulting liquid composition contains minerals but at the same time has acceptable taste and leaves no undesirable aftertaste while the stability and bioavailability of the mineral is uncompromised. This invention has also been found to make liquid compositions that contain particular mineral sources having substantially clear and colorless appearance.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
As used herein, the term "comprising" means various components conjointly employed in the preparation of the liquid compositions of the present invention. Accordingly, the terms "consisting essentially of and "consisting of are embodied in the term "comprising".<br>
As used herein, the terms "per serving", "per unit serving" or "serving size" refers to 250 milliliters of the finished beverage.<br>
As used herein, all parts, percentages and ratios are based on weight unless otherwise specified.<br>
The U.S. Recommended Daily Intake (USRDI) for vitamins and minerals are defined and set forth hi the Recommended Daily Dietary Allowance-Food and Nutrition Board, National Academy of Sciences National Research Council, for a serving size of 250 mis of the liquid composition. As used herein, a nutritionally supplemental amount of minerals is at least about 5%, preferably from about 10% to about 200%, of the USRDI of such minerals. As used herein, a nutritionally supplemental amount of vitamins is at least about 5%, preferably from about 20% to about 200%, more preferably from about 25% to 100%, of the USRDI of such vitamins.<br>
It is recognized, however, that the preferred daily intake of any vitamin or mineral may vary with the user. For example, persons suffering with anemia may require an increased intake of iron. Persons suffering from poor appetite, growth, performance and health may be suffering from mineral and vitamin deficiencies or who have poor diets will require more nutrients, for example, zinc, iodine, vitamin A, vitamin C and the B-vitamins (e. g. folate, B^, Be), particularly women of<br><br>
child bearing age, physically active adults and growing children in developing countries. Such matters are familiar to physicians and nutritional experts, and usage of the compositions of the present invention may be adjusted accordingly.<br>
t<br>
Mineral Fortification System<br>
Turning now to the drawings wherein Figure 1 is a mineral-fortification system 10 according to the present invention, which comprises cap 12 with plunger 14. Plunger 14 comprises barb 16, is adjacent plunger detent 22, and is slideably housed within cap housing 26. In Figure 1 cap 12 is shown on bottle 40 that contains liquid 42. Plunger detent 22 has been depressed by the consumer (not shown) pushing plunger 14 and plunger barb 16 through pouch membrane 19, which opens pouch 18 releasing fortification powder 20. Fortification powder 20 comprises a mineral supplement and a redox modulator, both of which are discussed in greater detail below. Fortification powder 20 may also contain the various optional ingredients discussed below. As shown in Figure 1 when pouch 18 is opened and the mineral fortification powder is released it will fall into liquid 42 where it can be mixed by slight agitation (for example, shaking of the bottle by the consumer) to form a mineral fortified liquid composition. Liquid 42 can be any liquid suitable for consumption by mammals, although water and water based liquids are preferred.<br>
Figure 2 is a mineral-fortification system similar to that of Fig. 1 before the pouch is punctured. Note that in Figure 2 cap housing 27 of cap 13 is designed to sit on top of a bottle rather that sealing the bottle top by enclosing its' neck. Cap 13 provides a mineral fortification system that can fortify a liquid in a variety of bottles because it is not constrained to any one bottle neck design and the threads or other enclosure devices associated therewith. Moreover, pouch 18 is shown in Figure 2 as being attached to cap 13, but this need not be the case.<br>
Figure 3 shows a pouch 18 containing mineral fortification powder 20. As can be seen, pouch 18 can be a self contained, free standing unit that can be associated with or attached to either of cap 13 or bottle 40. Likewise, as shown in Figure 6, pouch 218 can be associated with neither cap 212 nor bottle 240, but is rather placed between them at the time of use.<br><br>
Figure 4 shows yet another mineral-fortification system 110 according to the present invention comprising cap 112 with a blade 134 that cuts into pouch 118 when cap 112 is screwed onto package 141, via cap threads 130 and package threads 132. Blade 134 is<br>
»<br>
associated with cap 112 but could easily be associated with the bottle as shown in Figures 6 and 7, wherein blade 234 is on bottle 240. Returning to Figures 4 and 5, package 141 can be a bottle, a jar, a juice box or any other appropriate container for liquid. Figure 5 illustrates the mineral-fortification system of Fig. 4 after pouch membrane 119 has been cut open by blade 134, dispensing mineral fortification powder 120 into liquid 142 to form the desired mineral fortified liquid compositions of the present invention.<br>
Removable retaining ring 124, shown in Figure 4, is used to insure that pouch 118 cannot be opened prematurely. It is understood that one of the purposes of the present invention is to allow the consumer to mix, that is prepare, the mineral fortified liquid whenever he or she wishes. It can be seen that blade 134 does not penetrate pouch membrane 119 when cap 112 is first screwed onto package 141. Rather, cap 112 is screwed partially into package 141 with no contact between blade 134 and pouch membrane 119. Retaining ring 124 locks cap 112 into this pre-cutting position. Retaining ring 124 can be easily removed by pulling a tab or breaking a seal, and then removing the ring. Once retaining ring 124 is removed, cap 112 is further screwed onto package 141 allowing blade 134 to cut into pouch membrane 119 opening pouch 118. Thus, to insure that cap 112 is not screwed into package 141 before the consumer wants it to be, retaining ring 124 is attached to cap 112. Retaining rings are, of course, optional for the mineral fortification systems of the present invention, but they can be used with any of the embodiments shown herein.<br>
As mentioned briefly above, Figures 6 and 7 illustrate a mineral-fortification system 210 according to the present invention comprising cap 212 wherein blade 234 is adjacent bottle 240. Moreover, pouch 218, comprising pouch membrane 219 and mineral fortification powder 220, is separate from bottle 240 and cap 212. As such, pouch 218 can be sold and shipped separately from cap 212, bottle 240 and liquid 242. Thus, pouch 218 can be placed on the open bottle 240 and cap 212 screwed onto bottle 240 via cap threads 230 and bottle threads 232. At some point before cap 212 is fully screwed onto bottle 240, blade 234 contacts and cuts pouch membrane 219 releasing mineral fortification powder 220 into liquid 242 as shown in Figure 7.<br>
Turning now to Figure 8, which shows mmeral-fortification system 310 according to the present invention comprising cap 312 with plunger 314. Plunger 314 comprises plunger barb 316,<br><br>
plunger detent 322, and is slideably housed within cap housing 326. Further, plunger 314 comprises plunger hollow core 315 that can contain mineral fortification powder 320. In Figure 8 cap 312 is shown on bottle 340. When plunger detent 322 is depressed by the consumer (not shown), plunger 314 and plunger barb 316 are pushed through pouch membrane 319, which opens pouch 318 releasing fortification powder 320. In this embodiment pouch 318 comprises a single layer pouch membrane 319 and plunger hollow core 315. Fortification powder 320 comprises a mineral supplement and a redox modulator, both of which are discussed in greater detail below. Fortification powder 320 may also contain the various optional ingredients discussed below.<br>
Mineral-fortification system 310 further comprises removable retaining cap 312 that protects plunger 314 from being depressed prematurely. Figure 9 is a top view of mineral-fortification system 310 showing removable retaining cap 312, retaining cap perforations 329 and retaining cap access 328. Retaining cap 325 can be removed by sticking and available implement, such as a finger tip, car key, etc., into retaining cap access 328, and applying an upward force sufficient to tear perforation 329. Once retaining cap 325 has been removed, plunger detent 322 can be pushed down causing plunger barb 316 to pierce and open pouch membrane 319 releasing mineral fortification powder 320.<br>
Turning now to Figure 10, which shows yet another embodiment of the present invention, specifically, mineral-fortification system 410 comprising cap 412 with plunger 414. Plunger 414 comprises plunger detent 422 and pouch seal 421, and is slideably housed within cap housing 426. Further, plunger 414 comprises plunger hollow core 415 that can contain mineral fortification powder 420. When plunger detent 422 is depressed by the consumer (not shown), plunger 414 and pouch seal 421 slide within cap housing 426 allowing the hollow core edges 417 of plunger hollow core 415 to be exposed as pouch seal 421 is pushed beyond cap housing 426 as shown in Figure 11. When plunger hollow core edges 417 are exposed, pouch 418 is opened releasing fortification powder 420. Fortification powder 420 comprises a mineral supplement and a redox modulator, both of which are discussed in greater detail below. Fortification powder 420 may also contain the various optional ingredients discussed below.<br>
The various components of the present systems, for example, caps, bottles, blades and plungers can be made from any of a variety of commonly available materials such as, plastic, glass, metal, paper, and laminates of these. The pouch membranes should be made of a material that is readily opened by the blade or plunger used to open the pouch. Moreover, the pouch membrane should not adversely affect the liquid after it is opened. For example, a glass pouch might be inappropriate for use herein if it breaks hi a manner that leaves glass shards in the liquid. If, however, a portion of the pouch is made of glass and this portion remains intact after a different portion of the pouch membrane is cut, then there would be no contamination of the<br><br>
liquid. This design, and many more that involve combinations of various materials, would be appropriate for use in the present invention. For a more detailed description of the component parts for use in the present system please see the following US Patents: 6,105,760, which issued to Mollstam et al. on August 22, 2000; 6,098,795, which issued to Mollstam et al. on August 8, 2000; 6,209,718, which issued to Mollstam et al. on April 3, 2001; 5,884,759, which issued to Gueret on March 23, 1999; 5,419,429, which issued to Zimmerman et al. on May 30, 1995, and 5,370,222, which issued to Steigerwald et al. on December 6, 1994.

Mineral Supplement Source<br>
The mineral fortification systems of the present invention comprise a mineral fortification powder that comprises a mineral compound that is selected from the group consisting of calcium, iron, zinc, copper, manganese, iodine, magnesium, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The mineral fortified liquid compositions of the present invention typically contain at least about 1 ppm of the mineral compound, or an amount sufficient to deliver about 5% to about 100% USRDI of the mineral (based per serving). Preferably the compositions contain from about 15% to about 50%, and most preferably about 20% to about 40% of the USRDI for the added mineral.<br>
Iron Source<br>
The iron compound of the present invention is selected from a water-soluble iron compound, a water-dispersible particulate iron compound, and mixtures thereof. In addition, the iron compound of the present invention is preferably selected from a complexed iron compound, a chelated iron compound, an encapsulated iron compound, and mixtures thereof. The iron compound should also be bioavailable to provide the health benefits herein before described.<br>
A preferred iron compound can be added to a liquid to provide an iron-fortified liquid that reduces, and preferably eliminates the metallic taste and aftertaste that is typical of iron-containing waters and beverages. The elimination of the metallic taste can be achieved by encapsulating the iron compound. The metallic taste can also be eliminated by binding the iron into a stable compound by complexing or chelating with a suitable ligand that does not permit the iron to be freely associated in the water.<br>
The inventors have discovered that a key factor hi maintaining the stability of the ferrous state in a liquid is the control of the redox potential (reducing and oxidizing power) of the liquid. This work was done in an aqueous environment and the various ions compounds in water will undergo oxidation-reduction reactions, hi an equilibrium state that is dictated by the redox<br><br>
potential of the water system. In the case of iron, ferric iron (Fe3+) can be reduced chemically to ferrous iron (Fe2+) in an equilibrium state, if a redox potential of 770 mV or less is attained and maintained. Preferably, the redox potential is maintained below about 700 mV, more preferably below 500 mV, even more preferably below 300 mV, yet even below 200 mV, and most preferably below 150 mV.<br>
Preferred iron compound forms also include encapsulates and complexes that have a dispersed particle size in the water that is small enough to be barely visible in solution. Preferably, the dispersed particle size is about 100 nanometers (rim) or less, and more preferably about 80 run or less. A particularly preferred iron sources are inert and/or stabilized, micron-sized iron complexed with (a) pyrophosphate/orthophosphate as in SunActive iron (Taiyo Company, Japan) and (b) EDTA as in Na Fe(in)EDTA.<br>
A iron compound form useful for the purpose of the present invention is ferrous sulfate encapsulated hi a hydrogenated soybean oil matrix, for example, CAP-SHURE, available from Balchem Corp., Slate Hill, N.Y., and chelated iron (i.e., ferrous) wherein the chelating agent is an amino acid, for example, FERROCHEL AMINO ACID CHELATE, available from Albion Laboratories, Inc., Clearfield, Utah. Other solid fats can be used to encapsulate the ferric sulfate, such as tristearin, hydrogenated com oil, cottonseed oil, sunflower oil, tallow and lard.<br>
Ferrous amino acid chelates particularly suitable as highly bioavailable amino acid chelated irons for use in the present invention are those having a ligand to metal ratio of at least 2:1. For example, suitable ferrous amino acid chelates having a ligand to metal mole ratio of two (2) are those of formula "Fe(L)2", where L is an alpha amino acid, dipeptide, tripeptide or quadrapeptide reacting ligand. Thus, L can be any reacting ligand that is a naturally occurring alpha amino acid selected from alanine, arginine, asparagine, aspartic acid, cysteine, cystine, glutarnine, glutamic acid, glycine, histidine, hydroxyproline, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, omithine, phenylalanine, proline, serine, threonine, tryptophan, tyrosine and valine or dipeptides, tripeptides or quadrapeptides formed by any combination of these alpha amino acids. See U.S. Patent 3,969,540 (Jensen), issued July 13, 1976 and U.S. Patent 4,020,158 (Ashmead), issued April 26, 1977; U.S. Patent 4,863,898 (Ashmead et al), issued September 5, 1989; U.S. Patent 4,830,716 (Ashmead), issued May 16,1989; and U.S. Patent 4,599,152 (Ashmead), issued July 8,1986, all of which are incorporated by reference. Particularly preferred ferrous amino acid chelates are those where the reacting ligands are glycine, lysine, and leucine. Most preferred is the ferrous amino acid chelate sold under the Trade name FERROCHEL by Albion Laboratories where the reacting ligand is glycine.<br>
Ferrous iron is typically better utilized by the body than ferric iron. Highly bioavailable food grade ferrous salts that can be used in the present invention include ferrous sulfate, ferrous<br><br>
fumarate, ferrous succinate, ferrous gluconate, ferrous lactate, ferrous tartrate, ferrous citrate, ferrous amino acid chelates, as well as mixtures of these ferrous salts. Certain ferric salts can also provide a highly bioavailable source of iron. Highly bioavailable food grade ferric salts are ferric saccharate, ferric ammonium citrate, ferric citrate, ferric sulfate, ferric chloride, as well as mixtures of these ferric salts.<br>
Other bioavailable sources of iron particularly suitable for fortifying liquid of the present invention include certain iron-sugar-carboxylate complexes. In these iron-sugar-carboxylate complexes, the carboxylate provides the counterion for the ferrous (preferred) or ferric iron. The overall synthesis of these iron-sugar-carboxylate complexes involves the formation of a calcium-sugar moiety in aqueous media (for example, by reacting calcium hydroxide with a sugar, reacting the iron source (such as ferrous ammonium sulfate) with the calcium-sugar moiety hi aqueous media to provide an iron-sugar moiety, and neutralizing the reaction system with a carboxylic acid (the "carboxylate counterion") to provide the desired iron-sugar-carboxylate complex. Sugars that can be used to prepare the calcium-sugar moiety include any of the ingestible saccharidic materials, and mixtures thereof, such as glucose, sucrose and fructose, marmose, galactose, lactose, and maltose, with sucrose and fructose being the more preferred. The carboxylic acid providing the "carboxylate counterion" can be any ingestible carboxylic acid such as citric acid, malic acid, tartaric acid, lactic acid, succinic acid, propionic acid, etc., as well as mixtures of these acids.<br>
These iron-sugar-carboxylate complexes can be prepared in the manner described in U.S. Patents 4,786,510 and 4,786,518 (Nakel et al) issued November 22, 1988, both of which are Incorporated by reference. These materials are referred to as "complexes," but they can, in fact, exist in solution as complicated, highly hydrated, protected colloids; the term "complex" is used for the purpose of simplicity.<br>
The amount of iron compound added to the beverage dry mix can vary widely depending upon the level of supplementation desired in the final product and the targeted consumer. The USRDI for iron generally range from 10 mg per 6 kg female or male to 18 mg per 54-58 kg female, depending somewhat on age. The kon fortified compositions of the present invention typically contain at least about 1 ppm of iron compound, sufficient to deliver about 5% to about 100% USRDI of iron (based per serving) to account for iron that is available from other dietary sources (assuming a reasonably balanced diet). Preferably the compositions contain from about 15% to about 50%, and most preferably about 20% to about 40% of the USRDI for kon.<br>
Zinc Source<br>
The zinc compounds used ha the present invention can be in any of the commonly used forms such as the sulfate, chloride, acetate, gluconate, ascorbate, citrate, aspartate, picolinate,<br><br>
amino acid chelated zinc, as well as zinc oxide. It has been found, however, because of taste reasons, that amino acid chelated zinc sources are particularly preferred. The zinc-fortified composition of the present invention typically contains at least 5 ppm of zinc. Preferably, the liquid compositions contains zinc compound to provide about 5% to about 100% USRDI of zinc (based per serving) to account for that which is available from other dietary sources (assuming a reasonably balanced diet). Preferably the compositions contain from about 15% to about 50% and, preferably from about 25% to 40% of the USRDI for zinc.<br>
The zinc compound can also be an encapsulated zinc compound, utilizing encapsulating materials described herein above for the iron compound.<br>
Preferred zinc compound forms also include encapsulates and complexes that have a dispersed particle size in the water that is small enough to be barely visible in solution. Additionally, the preferred zinc sources are inert and/or stabilized, micron-sized zinc from zinc oxide in a dispersed particle size is about 100 nanometers (nm) or less, and more preferably about 80 nm or less.<br>
Other Mineral Sources<br>
Nutritionally supplemental amounts of other minerals for incorporation into the liquid composition include, but are not limited to, calcium, magnesium and copper. Any water-soluble salt of these minerals can be used, e.g., copper sulfate, copper gluconate, copper citrate and amino acid chelated copper. A preferred calcium source is a calcium citrate malate composition described hi U.S. Patent 4,789,510, U.S. Patent 4,786,518 and U.S. Patent 4,822,847. Calcium in the form of calcium phosphate, calcium carbonate, calcium oxide and calcium hydroxide in micron-sized particles in a dispersed particle size is about 100 nanometers (nm) or less, and more preferably about 80 nm or less. Additional calcium sources include calcium citrate, calcium lactate and amino acid chelated calcium. Among the magnesium sources, the preferred are magnesium oxide and magnesium phosphate in micron-sized particles in a dispersed particle size is about 100 nanometers (nm) or less, and more preferably about 80 nm or less.

Preparation of the liquid composition<br>
The liquid compositions of the present invention can be prepared from a variety of liquid sources. Most preferred are deionized water, softened water, or distilled water.<br>
The present invention provides a process step wherein fortification of water with minerals and vitamins is accomplished without the development of undesirable color, solubility, flavor and bioavailability through redox modulation, which in this case is reducing the redox potential. A preferred treatment comprises removing and or scavenging the main species in water that contributes to its high redox potential, which is the dissolved oxygen. The process includes deoxygenating the water to reduce the concentration of oxygen in the water, or to eliminate all dissolved oxygen. Preferred methods of deoxygenating the water include stripping of oxygen (and other dissolved gases) with carbon dioxide or other inert gas. Preferred as inert gases, such as nitrogen gas. Oxygen gas can also be reduced by heating the water to high temperatures, at which the solubility is reduced. Another method comprises adding reducing agents to the water, such as ascorbic acid. The oxygen level in the source water is typically reduced to less than 5 ppm, preferably less than 3 ppm, and more preferably less than 1 ppm.<br>
The deoxygenation process typically also removes other redox potential increasing agent, such as any halide gas, like chlorine gas, as well as volatile organic materials. Additionally, the water used is treated to have minimal amount of the other electron acceptors that have greater redox potential than that of iron. These include ozone, chloride and hypochlotates, nitrates and nitrites as well as manganese (IV).<br>
The mineral compound, is then admixed at the desired nutrient level, typically under mild stirring. Preferably, the admixing step is conducted under an inert gas blanket to exclude outside air and oxygen from the product.<br>
Finally, the water is packaged into glass or plastic bottles, or other suitable container. Preferably, the plastic material of the bottle is an oxygen-impermeable barrier.<br><br>

The following are non-limiting examples of mineral fortification powders that can be use in the pouch of the mineral fortification systems of the present invention.    The mineral<br>
t<br>
fortification powders are prepared utilizing conventional methods.  The following examples are provided to illustrate the invention and are not intended to limit the scope thereof in any manner.<br>
Example 1<br>
A mineral fortification powder is prepared having the following ingredients in the indicated amounts:<br>
(Table Remove) Upon preparing the mineral fortification powder, it is placed hi a sealed pouch and inserted into a cap as shown in Figure 1. The cap is then placed on a bottle of Reverse Osmosis/Millipore (Milli-Q) water and the plunger is depressed. The bottle of water is gently swirled to mix the powder and to make a fortified liquid composition that has no off-color or rusty color, no precipitation or turbidity, and low redox potential. The taste of the liquid composition is not significantly different in metallic taste or after-taste when compared to the liquid vehicle alone (Reverse Osmosis/Millipore (Milli-Q) Water).<br>
Example 2<br>
A mineral-fortified liquid composition according to the present invention, and more specifically, according to Example 1, was compared to common tap water, distilled water treated by a common Reverse Osmosis process, and a variety of commercially available bottle waters. Some of the commercially available bottled waters were supplemented with vitamins. Using the measure values for the Redox potential (listed as "mV" in Table 2A) and pH, the inequality RP - (A - B*pH) was calculated for various values of "A" and "B". The results of these calculations are givenm in Table 2A. Table 2B gives additional data from the comparison of these products.<br><br>
