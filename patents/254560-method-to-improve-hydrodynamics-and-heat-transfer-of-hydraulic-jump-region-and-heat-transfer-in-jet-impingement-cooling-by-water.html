FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method of Jet impingement cooling used for<br>
Run-Out-Table cooling thermal processing stage in industries such as steel. More<br>
particularly, the invention relates to a method to improve hydrodynamics and<br>
heat transfer of hydraulic jump region in the process of jet impingement cooling.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Jet impingement cooling is used for Run-Out-Table cooling thermal processing<br>
stage in industries such as steel, in addition to other applications such as<br>
electronic cooling and high heat flux technology. It offers low thermal<br>
resistances and is easy to implement. Liquid jets are created using a straight<br>
tube or contracting nozzle. The cooling medium is water with laminar or<br>
turbulent jets impinging on the hot surface. When the jet strikes the hot<br>
surface, a thin stagnation-zone is formed, which offers little resistance to heat<br>
flow. The maximum heat transfer coefficients are present at the stagnation point<br>
regions. The whole field of flow after the jet strikes the hot surface consists of<br>
stagnation zone, region of boundary-layer type flow, liquid film region, region<br>
having similarity velocity profile, hydraulic jump region and the region of<br>
undisturbed flow downstream the hydraulic jump (Nakoryakov, et al., 1978). For<br>
quick cooling as in the case of steel, the surface temperature drops from its<br>
initial temperature to close to the corresponding water temperature very soon<br>
after the jet strikes. The hydraulic jump region is the region of reduced heat<br>
transfer because of number of issues mainly related to the thick water film.<br><br>
3<br>
The effects of surface tension tend to become important in the region of the<br>
hydraulic jump due to large effects of curvature (Rao and Arakeri, 1998). The<br>
heat transfer outside or external to hydraulic jump region is drastically reduced<br>
and therefore presents difficulties in removing heat from the hot surface<br>
appropriately. In multiple jet configurations, the regions of hydraulic jumps<br>
interact and effective cooling is dependent on the jet design aspects such as jet<br>
spacing, jet number, and jet flow rates, among others. During thermal<br>
processing of steel, uniform temperature establishment across the width and<br>
length of steel strip/plate is a concern because of these variable rates of heat<br>
transfer from the strip surface.<br>
It has been observed (Bush and Aristoff, 2003) that surface tension influence on<br>
the circular hydraulic jump has been shown to have useful characteristic of<br>
relaxation in hydraulic jump, that is to say, expanding smoothly to a new larger<br>
radius, which is approximately 20 to 30% larger for decrease in surface tension<br>
with the application of a small volume (1-2 drops) of surfactant (either a<br>
commercial detergent or superwetting agent) added to the glycerol-water<br>
solutions. These observations were made for laminar circular hydraulic jumps,<br>
which were formed on the surface of glycerol-water solutions in the reservoir<br>
having base made of circular glass target plate on the center of which the jet<br>
impacted. The surface tension influence was found to be most significant for<br>
jumps of small radius and small height.<br>
Addition of a surfactant (liquid Dove) to the reservoir, which reduces the surface<br>
tension from 70 to 40dyn/cm, causes the polygonal jump generated with<br>
glycerol-water solution to relax into a circular form, to become less abrupt and to<br>
expand slightly (Bush, et al., 2006). Influence of an unknown detergent on<br>
splattering of turbulent jets indicates lower Froude number behaviour, that is<br><br>
4<br>
better heat transfer as observed with water jets (Wasekar, 2007), which is<br>
representative of decrease in water film height (Rao and Arakeri, 1998). The<br>
influence of surface tension on the stagnation-point heat transfer during<br>
impingement of laminar water jets is insignificant except for low-velocity small-<br>
diameter jets (Liu, et al., 1993). For the jet diameters in the range of 0.3 to 0.6<br>
mm, the stagnation Nusselt number is more strongly dependent on Reynolds<br>
number for initially laminar jets than fully turbulent jets due to surface-tension<br>
induced jet broadening and associated modification of the jet flow structure<br>
(Elison and Webb, 1994). In liquid film region, the nucleate boiling heat transfer<br>
coefficient has been found to increase for aqueous solutions of the surface-active<br>
agents compared to water (Shibayama, et al., 1978).<br>
There is no patent literature or prior art known to this inventor that discloses<br>
invention regarding surfactant addition to water in the field of jet impingement<br>
cooling. US patent 3846254 and GB patent 1363063 disclose the addition of<br>
surfactant to liquid to increase the rate of evaporation for channel flow or flow<br>
through evaporator. The surfactant addition is supported through the reduction<br>
in pressure, which creates foamy two-phase vapour liquid flow as the liquid is<br>
evaporated while being passed through the flow channel or evaporator. The<br>
high heat and/or mass transfer enhancement associated depends upon several<br>
factors that include, increase in vapour-liquid interfacial area, thinning of liquid<br>
layer in contact with heat transfer surface with the formation of foam network,<br>
agitation and continuous renewal of liquid film by vapour bubbles, better wetting<br>
and prevention of dryout and reduction in hydrodynamic pressure gradient. The<br>
disadvantage of this invention is that it cannot be used for the jet impingement<br>
cooling where single phase jet is used. Furthermore, Run-Out-Table cooling<br>
application presents open channel flow and foamy two-phase vapour liquid flow<br>
through a flow channel, as mentioned in above patents, is not effective because<br>
extensive foaming on the water surface can reduce heat transfer rate by blocking<br>
vapour removal and due to trapped surfactant concentration  in foam.  EP<br><br>
5<br>
1691143A2 disclose addition of defoaming wetting agent or a low foaming<br>
wetting agent or a wetting agent and a defoaming agent in the heat transfer<br>
fluid of a boiler system to improve heat transfer by reducing the size of bubbles<br>
forming on the surface of the element. The disadvantage of this invention is that<br>
the additives used are applicable for system requiring bubble nucleation. The jet<br>
impingement cooling doesn't necessarily require to have boiling or bubble<br>
nucleation. This can be seen from its applications using water without surfactant<br>
additive for electronic cooling as disclosed in US patent 5228502 and cooling of a<br>
high-power solid state laser as disclosed in US 6859472.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>

prior art.<br>

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention discloses a method to improve hydrodynamics and heat transfer of<br>
the hydraulic jump region and heat transfer in jet impingement cooling. The<br>
method uses known surfactant additive in water. The method additionally uses a<br>
four nozzle test section module, which is designed for equal flow rate for each<br>
nozzle and provides accurate adjustments using Tee, Elbow and Tube/Pipe<br>
connections to study the effects of nozzle spacing/pitch that help to investigate<br>
the stagnation zone interferences, hydraulic jump interactions, hydrodynamics<br>
and heat transfer. The flow rate range covers all ranges from laminar to<br>
turbulent. The surfactant concentration is small, which changes only the surface<br>
tension of water and the other properties remain the same.<br>
Jet impingement cooling is used for Run-Out-Table cooling application. Water is<br>
used as cooling medium. A commercial surfactant, DuPont™ Zonyl® FSH is<br>
used, which is a nonionic fluorosurfactant having useful wetting and spreading<br>
characteristics. Other surfactants having cooling characteristics as that of<br>
DuPont™ Zonyl® FSH are the potential candidates as surfactant additives.<br>
Surfactant(s) is/are dissolved in water that strikes/impinges on the surface to be<br>
cooled. Circular cross-sectional pipes/tubes are used for impinging jets of<br>
aqueous surfactant solution(s). Impinging jet nozzle cross-section can have<br>
cross-section other than circular. Impinging jet impinges normally on the surface<br><br>
8<br>
to be cooled. The orientation of the surface to be cooled need not necessarily be<br>
horizontal. Nozzle test section module provides accurately equal flow rate for<br>
each nozzle of a four nozzle jet impingement configuration using Tee, Elbow and<br>
Tube/Pipe connections that provide accurate adjustments to study the effects of<br>
nozzle spacing, pitch that help to investigate the stagnation zone interferences,<br>
hydraulic jump interactions and hydrodynamics &amp; heat transfer. Improvement in<br>
impingement water jet cooling having surfactant additive in water is evaluated by<br>
comparing the jet cooling performance with that for impinging water jet(s)<br>
without surfactant additive(s).<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
This invention discloses a method to improve hydrodynamics and heat transfer of<br>
the hydraulic jump region and heat transfer in jet impingement cooling. The<br>
method uses commercial surfactant additive.<br>
In water, in the aqueous impinging jets for the application of Run-Out-Table<br>
cooling, the improvement in hydrodynamics and heat transfer in the hydraulic<br>
jump region is obtained by reducing the liquid thickness or in other words by<br>
reducing the conduction resistance of the water film present over the hot steel<br>
strip/plate.<br>
Aqueous solutions of commercial surfactant additives DuPont™ Zonyl® FSH have<br>
been investigated for the impinging jet cooling flow in this invention and the<br>
results show excellent cooling characteristics for the application of interest,<br>
where the improvement in the heat transfer from the hot steel surface is<br>
experimentally found. The hot steel surface was cooled from around 800°C to<br>
temperatures of around 30°C. This invention is applicable to any other heated<br>
surface that is required to be cooled by water. The Froude number which is<br>
defined as square of jet velocity divided by the product of height of nozzle from<br>
the surface to be cooled and the acceleration due to gravity is in the range<br>
having values less that 2 or around 2. DuPont™ Zonyl® FSH is a nonionic<br>
fluorosurfactant having structure as present below (DuPont, 2001).<br>
RfCH2CH2O(CH2CH2O)xH, where Rf=F(CF2CF2)y<br>
The commercial surfactant additive DuPont™, Zonyl® FSH gives exceptionally low<br>
surface tension in aqueous solutions of the order of 17 to 22 dyn/cm for the<br><br>
10<br>
surfactant concentration range of 0.1 to 0.001% and provides better wetting and<br>
spreading characteristics. Even at very low concentrations, it delivers tremendous<br>
wetting power. In addition, in the experiments of this invention, it has been<br>
found to be stable in its aqueous solutions at high temperatures required for<br>
cooling application of interest. The surfactant additive influences the heat<br>
transfer and flow behaviour. The surfactant improves the wetting front velocity<br>
as surface tension of water is reduced. This helps in the spreading of water over<br>
the hot steel strip/plate faster. This in turn reduces the resident time. Thus,<br>
higher metal temperatures can be easily dealt with for cooling. The surfactant<br>
concentration is small, which changes only the surface tension of water and the<br>
other properties remain the same. DuPont™ Zonyl® FSH is nonhazardous,<br>
nonflammable thus making it an appropriate choice as safe and economically<br>
useful additive.<br>
The method additionally uses a four nozzle test section module as illustrated in<br>
Fig. (1), which has been designed for equal flow rate for each nozzle and<br>
provides accurate adjustments using Tee, Elbow and Tube/pipe connections to<br>
study the effects of nozzle spacing/pitch that help to investigate the stagnation<br>
zone interferences, the hydraulic jump interactions, and hydrodynamics &amp; heat<br>
transfer. The flow rate range covers all ranges from laminar to turbulent.<br>
The surfactant concentration is small which changes only the surface tension of<br>
water and other properties remain the same.<br>
Fig. (1) shows the schematic of jet impingement cooling facility wherein hot steel<br>
strip/plate (1) is cooled using nozzles (2), which are circular tube/pipes having<br>
length sufficient to overcome the entrance effects, such that fully developed flow<br>
exists form each nozzle. The coolant (water/aqueous surfactant solution) is<br>
circulated using a pump (3). Flow rate is measured using turbine flow meter (4).<br>
The flow rate range covers all the ranges from laminar to turbulent.<br><br>
11<br>
The temperature measurements are carried out by connecting thermocouples (5)<br>
on the back side of the strip/plate.<br>
Fig 2 illustrates the schematic diagram of nozzle test section module. It is<br>
designed for equal flow rate for each nozzle. The set up provides accurate<br>
adjustment to study the effects on nozzle spacing/pitch that help to investigate<br>
the stagnation zone interferences, the hydraulic jump interactions, and<br>
hydrodynamics &amp; heat transfer.<br>
The system also has provision for the connection of turbine flow meter (4) for<br>
low rate measurements. Circular cross-sectional pipes/tubes are used for<br>
impinging jets of aqueous surfactant solutions, wherein other sections can also<br>
be used.<br>
Nozzle test section module (6) is designed as a four nozzle jet impingement<br>
configuration using Tee, Elbow, Tube/pipe connections as shown in Fig 2.<br>
Improvement of impingement water jet cooling having surfactant additive in<br>
water is evaluated by comparing the jet cooling performance with that for<br>
impinging water jet (s) without surfactant additives.<br>
