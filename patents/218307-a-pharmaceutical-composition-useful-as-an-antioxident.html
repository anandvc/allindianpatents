				<td>Field of the invention<br>
This invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition useful as an antioxident .More particularly this invention relates to the isolation of two compounds namely (-)-Matairesinol (4,4'-dihydroxy-3, 31- dimethoxylignan-9, 9'-olide) and (-)-wikstromol (4,4',8-trihydroxy-3, 3'-dimethoxyliganan-9, 9'-olide) from the plant source Cedrus deodara in significant yields. This invention also identifies the use of the said compounds as an antioxidant or a free radical scavenger.<br>
Prior art<br>
The compound (-)-Matairesinol and (-)-wikstromol as such do not find much commercial value. The structural formulae of (-)-Matairesinol and (-)-wikstromol are as shown in Figure 1. Lignans are widely distributed in angiosperms and gymnosperms. The range of their structures and biological activities is broad. Literature indicates that Matairesinol exhibits CAMP phosphodiesterase inhibition activity [W.Donald Macrae and G.H.Neil Towers, Biological activities of Lignans, Phytochemistry 23 (6), 1207-20(1984)]. (-)-Wikstromol is found to be active against p-388 lymphocyte leukemia and anti-HIV activity (M.K.Khamlach, R.Dhal and E.Brown, Premieres syntheses totales du (+)-wikstromol, de la (-)-Trachelogenine, De la (-)-Nortrachelogenine et des lignoides apparentes -Tetrahedran 48, 10115- 10126(1992))<br>
The wood of Cedrus deodar possesses diaphoretic, diuretic and carminative properties, and it is useful in treatment of fevers, piles and pulmonary and urinary disorders. The extract of the bark is astringent and useful for fevers, diarrhoea and dysentery. The oleoresin of deodar and the dark-colored oil obtained from the wood are valued for their application for ulcers and skin diseases. [Ref: Wealth of India, Vol.11, P. 108-10 (1950) (published by CSIR)].<br>
A close look at literature suggests that the lignan, seco-isolariciresinalldiglycoside (SDG) which has been reported to possess multitude of activities is isolated from [US Patent 5,846,944]. The natural lignans (-)-matairesinol reduce the binding of H-labeled 5oÎ¬<br><br>
dihydrotestosterone (DHT) to human sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). [Matthias Schottnerand Gerhard Spiteller (J.Nat. Prod. 1998, 61, 119-121)].<br>
P.K.Agarwal and R.P.Rastogi (Phytochemistry Vol 21, No 6, pp 1459 - 1461, 1982) reported isolation of two lignans meso-secoisolariciresinol and cedrusinin from Cedrus deodara.<br>
The isolation of matariesional in 0.10 % yield and (+) -wikstromol in 0.124 % yield is reported from Wikstroemia viridiflora (Wikstromol, a new lignan from Wikstroemia viridiflora - Sheela Tandon and R.P.Rastogi; Phytochemistry 1976, vol 15, pp 1789-1791).<br>
The extraction of the lignans and other constituents namely (-)-nortrachelogenin, carinol and carissanol from Carissa edulis has been reported by Hans Achenbach, Reiner Waibel and Ivan Addae-Mensah, Ref. Phytochemistry, Vol.22, No.3, pp.749-753, 1983.<br>
There is a considerable amount of epidemiological evidence indicating an association between diet rich in fruits and vegetables and a decreased risk of cardiovascular disease and certain forms of cancer. It is generally assumed that the active principles contributing to these protective effects are nothing but antioxidant phytochemicals.<br>
Recent research is directed to find out phytochemicals from plant sources in highlighting the role of polyphenolic compounds of plant materials as antioxidants, antimutagenic, anti inflammatory, antiatherosclerotic, antidiabetic, antihepatotoxic and antimicrobial agents. [Overview of flax lignans by Neil D. Westcott and Alister D. Muir, Crop Utilization Section, Saskatoon Research Centre, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, 107, Science Place, Saskatoon, SK S7N 0X2, Canada in Volume II - January 2000 - inform]. Alcoholic extract of stem C.deodara was found to have anti-cancer activity. [Ref. Medicinal Plants of India (ICMR) Vol.1, 1976, pp.214 and 215].<br>
Medicinal importance of antioxidant active principles are acquiring importance because of the involvement of free radical mediated oxidative stress in age related diseases.<br><br>
Free radicals are highly energized molecules that contain an unpaired electron. These are produced through normal biological and environmental processes involving oxygen and can trigger chain reactions that product more free radicals. Normally there is a balance between the amount of free radicals generated in the body and antioxidants to protect against them. However, natural antioxidants present in the body can cope up only with the optimal generation of free radicals and any additional burden of free radicals or lack of antioxidant protection can tip this balance and lead to oxidative stress.<br>
There is a need for free radical scavengers or antioxidant principles isolated from natural resources for preparation of formulations useful in alleviating diseases. Hence, it becomes necessary to look for other lignans possessing related and important biological properties.<br>
Accordingly, the applicants conducted a detailed study on principles from Cedriis deodara and this investigation led to the isolation of two active principles namely, Matairesinol and wikstromol. These compounds although hitherto isolated from Wikstromia spp. were in low yields. Cedriis deodara hence is a new source for these lignans and their presence in this taxon in significantly high yields makes this invention more important.<br>
Objects of the invention<br>
The main object of the invention relates to provide a pharmaceutical composition comprising (-)-wikstromol and/or (-)-matairesinol useful as a free radical scavengers or antioxidants.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide methods for the isolation of (-)-wikstromol and/or (-)-matairesinol from Cedriis deodara.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
Accordingly, the invention provides novel compositions containing (-)-wikstromol and/or (-)-matairesinol and useful as free radical scavengers and antioxidants. The invention further provides methods for the isolation of (-)-wikstromol and/or (-)-matairesinol from Cedrus deodara as well as use of the compounds for the treatment of arteriosclerosis.<br><br>
Detailed Description<br>

Example 1<br>
Experimental protocol: a process for the isolation of (-)-Matairesinol and<br>
(-)- Wikstromol.<br>
The dried wood powder of Cedrus deodara was loaded 200 g in a soxhlet apparatus. The powder was first extracted with hexane to remove the essential oil composition. The<br><br>
residue from the extraction of hexane was further extracted with chloroform. The chloroform extract was concentrated under vacuum. The thick syrupy residue was dissolved in ethyl acetate for about 50g of residue around 60ml of ethyl acetate. The isolation of residue in ethyl acetate was added drop wise to hexane 9 around 5Lt. The solid separated 35-g was filtered off.<br>
The solid was loaded on silica gel column 60 120 mesh, 3.5-cm dia. Column loaded to a height of 60cm. Initially the column was eluted with chloroform followed by 3% methanol in chloroform of get (-)-Matairesinol.<br>
Further elution of the column with 5% methanol in chloroform yielded (-)- Wikstromol.<br>
The yield (-)-Matairesinol is around 0.06g.<br>
The yield (-) wikstromol is around 8.0g.<br>
The compounds (-)-Matairesinol and (-) wikstromol were obtained in 90% purity.<br>

In vitro evaluation of free radical scavenging antioxidant potency:<br>
Antioxidant activity of the compounds ((-)-Matairesinol and (-)-wikstromol) were te: for their capacity/potency to scavenger most widely used free radical 2,2-diphenyl-l-pi hydroxyl radical (DPPH). The well-accepted and tested probucol and Î¬-tocopherol v taken as reference compounds. Img/ml DMSO concentration of the compoi [(-)-Matairesinol and (-)-wikstromol] were prepared and subsequently, serially dilutei lower concentrations with DMSO 100 ml of test compounds were reconstituted to In Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) equal volume of 500 um of DPPH radical dissolved in eth; was reacted with this. After incubation for 45 minutes in dark, the absorbency at 51' was recorded. Radical with no compound was taken as control for calculation of % rac scavenging activity. All the readings were recorded in triplicate. Results (Figs. 2(a)&amp; show that compounds under consideration possess more potent antioxidant/rac scavenging potency than reference standards. Figures 2(a)&amp;(b) shows the data wherein antioxidant activity of (-)-Matairesinol and (-)-Wikstromol in comparison to commÂ» used Producol and Vitamin-E. It is well observed that the test compounds consiste show higher antioxidant activity than reference compounds in much lower concentratic<br><br>
In accordance with the practice of this invention, it has been found that (-)-matairesinol and (-)-wikstromol are isolated from a new source Cedrus deodara in significant yields. Also, it has been found that (-)-matairesinol and (-)-wikstromol show antioxidant properties.<br>
ADVANTAGES<br>
Antioxidant compounds recently have attracted the attention due to their broad spectrum activities in disorders of multiple origin viz., coronary heart disease, cancer, diabetes, rheumatic disorders and inflammatory condition where free radicals in causing/fostering the disease play important role. Much attention is being directed now to harness and harvest the antioxidant compounds from natural resources.<br>
The compounds (-)-Matairesinol and (-)-wikstromol are used in pure form.<br>
Hence, the usage is more advantageous than a mixture of compounds having similar properties, which are in current use. It is also important to note that the process of isolation of (-)-Matairesinol and (-)-wikstromol is highly economical when compared to the isolation of tocopherol which is a widely used antioxidant.<br>
(-)-Matairesinol and (-)-wikstromol are used at a high degree of purity of over 90%. They are found to be highly effective when administered at a dosage of 250mg/kg of body weight.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
