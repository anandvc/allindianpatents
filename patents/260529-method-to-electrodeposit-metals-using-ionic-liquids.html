				<td>Method to electrodeposit metals using ionic liquids<br>
The present invention relates to a method to electrodeposit a metal on a<br>
substrate using an ionic liquid as the electrolyte.<br>
Ionic liquids are non-volatile salts with a melting point below 100Â°C. Many are<br>
liquid even at room temperature and they represent a relatively new class of<br>
solvents.<br>
It is known that, in general, ionic liquids may be used in many applications, e.g.<br>
as reaction solvents, extraction solvents, electrolytes in batteries and<br>
electrodeposition, catalysts, heat exchange fluids, as additives in coatings.<br>
Until now, all commercially available ionic liquids suitable for use as electrolytes<br>
in electrodeposition have been relatively high-priced, i.e. in the order of about<br>
50 Euros up to about 1,000 Euros per kilogram. The term electrodeposition in<br>
this application should be understood to include both electroplating and<br>
electropolishing.<br>
A number of examples of the use of ionic liquids are disclosed for example on<br>
Merck's and lolitec's web pages: www.ionicliquids-merck.de and<br>
www.iolitec.com (dated February 3, 2006).<br>
Ionic liquids said to be useful in electrodeposition methods are specifically<br>
trioctylmethylammonium trifluoromethane sulphonate, N-methyl,N-trioctyl-<br>
ammonium bis(trifluoromethylsulphonyl)imide, trimethyl-N-hexylammonium<br>
bis(trifluoromethylsulphonyl)imide, N-butyl, N-trimethylammonium bis(trifluoro-<br>
methylsulphonyl)imide, 1 -butyl-1 -methyl-pyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethyl-<br>
sulphonyl)imide, 1 -hexyl-3-methylimidazolium tris(pentafluoroethyl)trifluoro-<br>
phosphate, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium trifluoroacetate, which are all quite<br>
expensive and carry the risk of very dangerous HF being formed as a<br>
decomposition product of fluorine-containing ionic liquids.<br><br>
The price of eutectic mixtures such as choline chloride/chromium chloride<br>
hexahydrate or choline chloride/zinc chloride, also reported to be used in<br>
electrodeposition, likewise is rather high. Furthermore, consumption of the<br>
metal salt which is a building component of such ionic liquids during the<br>
electrodeposition process may lead to decomposition of such ionic liquids.<br>
WO 2002/026381 discloses ionic liquids (eutectic mixtures) of choline chloride<br>
and a (hydrated) metal salt such as chromium(lll) chloride and the use thereof<br>
in electrodeposition and electropolishing. The mixtures consist of choline<br>
chloride and the (hydrated) metal salt in a ratio of ammonium to metal ion of<br>
between 1:1 and 1:2.5 and are specifically said to be suitable for depositing<br>
chromium, cobalt, zinc or silver on a metal substrate.<br>
However, there is a desire for ionic liquids suitable for use in an electro-<br>
deposition process which give a good quality of electrodeposited metal on a<br>
substrate (i.e. an electrocoated substrate with a good appearance or with<br>
adequate hardness) while at the same time they are economically attractive, or<br>
in other words, available in high quality at a low price. Also, there is a need in<br>
the industry for electrolytes suitable for use in an electrodeposition process<br>
which are energy efficient, not based on the use of toxic chemicals, and which<br>
enable large-scale plating. Moreover, there is a need for a method to deposit<br>
metals on a substrate that requires only a low metal concentration in the<br>
solvent, as this gives an improvement from an economic point of view and<br>
makes the process more controllable.<br>
Also, there is a desire for a method of electrodepositing metals on a substrate in<br>
which ionic liquid is used as an electrolyte wherein the ionic liquid has good<br>
electrical conductivity, a satisfying electrochemical stability range, and can<br>
dissolve sufficient quantities of the salts of the metal to be satisfactorily<br>
deposited on the substrate.<br><br>
Finally, there is a desire for a more suitable way of depositing certain metals<br>
using an electrochemical method, such materials currently being deposited<br>
using the methods known in the art, which pose significant health and<br>
environmental risks. Aluminium and titanium are examples of metals that cannot<br>
be deposited from aqueous solutions and are deposited from non-aqueous<br>
organic electrolytes. As such organic baths present an explosion and fire<br>
hazard, electrodeposition of such metals in more acceptable solvents would be<br>
highly beneficial. Furthermore, the present industrial chromium deposition<br>
processes still are based on chromic acid, which contains highly carcinogenic<br>
chromium (VI) (see e.g. Modern Electroplating by F.A. Lowenheim, 1942 or<br>
Electroplating Engineering Handbook by LJ. Durney, 1996). Also, conventional<br>
chromium plating baths require the use of strong acids, which poses significant<br>
disposal problems, while the use of the compounds of the invention enables<br>
such disposal difficulties to be minimised or eliminated.<br>
The present invention now provides a method to electroplate or electropolish a<br>
metal on a substrate wherein an ionic liquid selected from the group of<br>
N+R1R2R3R4 X- and N+R5R6R7R8 Y- is employed as electrolyte and a metal salt<br>
added to the ionic liquid is employed as the metal source or a metal anode is<br>
used as the metal source, wherein any one of R1 to R8 independently<br>
represents a hydrogen, alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, or aralkyl group that may be<br>
substituted with a group selected from OH, Cl, Br, F, I, phenyl, NH2, CN, NO2,<br>
COOR9, CHO, CORg, or OR9, at least one of R5 to R8 is a fatty alkyl chain, and<br>
one or more of R5 to R8 can be a (poly)oxyalkylene group wherein the alkylene<br>
is a C1 to C4 alkylene and the total number of oxyalkylene units can be from 1 to<br>
50 oxyalkylene units, and at least one of R1 to R8 is a C1 to C4 alkyl chain, R9 is<br>

which case the cation is divalent, hydrogen, a C1-C22 alkyl, alkenyl or aromatic<br>
group; the group of R12SO3- anions wherein R12 may be absent, in which case<br>
the cation is divalent, hydrogen, a C1-C22 alkyl, alkenyl or aromatic group; the<br>
group of R13CO3- anions wherein R13 may be absent, in which case the cation is<br>
divalent, hydrogen, a C1-C22 alkyl, alkenyl or aromatic group; and the group of<br>
R14-N--SO2-R15 anions wherein R14 and/or R15 independently may be hydrogen,<br>
a C1-C22 alkyl, alkenyl or aromatic group, and R14 may be linked to the nitrogen<br>
atom with a carbonyl group.<br>
A fatty alkyl chain is meant to include saturated and/or unsaturated chains and<br>
contains 8 to 22 carbon atoms; preferably, it contains 10 to 22 carbon atoms,<br>
most preferably 12 to 20 carbon atoms.<br>
In one embodiment, the N+R5R6R7R8 Y- ionic liquid has an iodine value of above<br>
1, preferably above 2, more preferably above 3, and most preferably above 5 g<br>
l2 per 100 gr of ionic liquid. The iodine value generally is below 210 g l2 per 100<br>
gr of ionic liquid.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, X- is based on a compound known as a sweetener.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, N+R1R2R3R4 is an amine wherein the groups<br>

C4 alkyl.<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment, the ionic liquid is selected from any one of choline<br>

US 4,849,438 discloses choline saccharinate, a method to prepare choline<br>
saccharinate, and the use of choline saccharinate to protect plants against fungi<br>
and bacteria. The choline saccharinate reaction product of Preparation Example<br>
1 first is an oily substance and later is in the crystal form because of the<br>
presence of 0.3 mol H2O per mol of choline saccharinate. In Preparation<br><br>
Example 3 choline saccharinate is prepared by reacting choline chloride and<br>
sodium saccharinate. It is not acknowledged that choline saccharinate is an<br>
ionic liquid, but in Example 3 it is implicitly understood to be an ionic liquid.<br>
E. B. Carter et al. in Chemical Communications 2004, (6), 630-631 disclose<br>
ionic liquids of saccharinate and acesulphamate anions and a quaternary<br>
ammonium cation such as a triethylmethyl ammonium or an imidazolium cation.<br>
J. Tang et al in Polymer 46 (2005), pp. 12460-12467 disclose a dodecyltriethyl<br>
ammonium based ionic liquid and the CO2 sorption thereof.<br>
However, none of the above documents discloses or suggests the suitability of<br>
N-acyl sulphonyl imide based or fatty alkyl based ionic liquids for use in a<br>
method to electrodeposit metals on a substrate.<br>
The above-indicated ionic liquids formed are safe - potentially food grade - and<br>
can be applied as a solvent in an electrodeposition or electropolishing method,<br>
since they contain a relatively low concentration of metal salt. On the other<br>
hand, the metal salt concentration range is broad, or in other words, the method<br>
to electrodeposit metals on a substrate according to the invention is controllable<br>
over a wide range of a relatively low metal salt concentration. The plated<br>
substrate resulting from the process according to the present invention has an<br>
improved appearance compared to the methods of the state of the art using<br>
other ionic liquids as the electrolyte. What is more, when using some of the<br>
ionic liquids disclosed in the state of the art as electrolyte in a method to<br>
electrodeposit, we were unable to get a layer of metal deposited on the<br>
substrate at all, especially not when the metal was used in the preferred amount<br>
as specified in this description.<br>
The above-indicated ionic liquids for use in the method according to the<br>
invention can be prepared by a simple reaction of salts, for example by a<br><br>
metathesis reaction of choline chloride and sodium saccharinate<br>
(acesulphamate) to form a choline saccharinate (acesulphamate) ionic liquid.<br>
Also, it has been found that an ionic liquid made on the basis of commercially<br>
available compounds, such as hydrogenated tallow methyl [polyoxy-<br>
ethylene(15)] ammonium chloride, cocoalkylmethyl [polyoxyethylene(15)]<br>
ammonium chloride, cocoalkylmethyl [polyoxyethylene(15)] ammonium<br>
methylsulphate, octadecylmethyl [polyoxyethylene(15)] ammonium chloride,<br>
and di(hydrogenated tallow) dimethyl ammonium chloride used as surfactants<br>
and rheology modifiers, is suitable to be employed in the process according to<br>
the invention.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the molar ratio of the ammonium cation of the ionic<br>
liquid to the metal cation of the metal salt, which comes from the dissolved salt<br>
or from the metal anode, is between 1,000:1 and 3:1. More preferred is a molar<br>
ratio of the ammonium cation of the ionic liquid to the metal cation of the metal<br>
salt of between 500:1 and 5:1, most preferred is a molar ratio between 100:1<br>
and 7:1, this providing a high-quality metal layer, excellent dissolution of the<br>
metal in the ionic liquid, and a good balance between the cost of the process<br>
and the appearance of the plated substrate product.<br>
In another preferred method to electrodeposit according to the present<br>
invention, one of the metals chromium, aluminium, titanium, zinc or copper is<br>
deposited; more preferably, chromium or aluminium is deposited, most<br>
preferably chromium.<br>
The electrodeposition is preferably performed at temperatures below 90 Â°C and<br>
more preferably at room temperature, in open electrodeposition vessels, but<br>
electrodeposition is not limited to these conditions. In the embodiment where a<br>
metal anode is used, the anode may be in the form of metal pieces, chunks,<br>
chips or any other suitable form known to the skilled person.<br><br>
The ionic compounds according to the invention also find application in<br>
electropolishing. For example, stainless steel can be polished using compounds<br>
according to the invention. Stainless steels form the largest commercial<br>
application for electropolishing and traditionally polishing baths contain mixtures<br>
based on concentrated sulphuric and phosphoric acids. These are highly toxic<br>
and corrosive and prone to form toxic and corrosive "mists" during<br>
electropolishing as a result of prodigious gas evolution due to the high current<br>
densities used. A major advantage of the preferred electropolishing processes<br>
according to the invention is that they are generally more environmentally<br>
friendly compared with the conventional methods. Additional advantages<br>
offered are that they can be performed at room temperature and can operate<br>
with lower power consumption, whilst providing bright reflective finishes<br>
comparable to traditional techniques. An additional advantage of the materials<br>
in accordance with the invention is that when they are used in electrolytic baths,<br>
in particular plating or electropolishing baths, hydrogen evolution is significantly<br>
reduced as compared with the acidic baths conventionally employed/This has a<br>
number of important consequences. First, it results in a very high current<br>
efficiency. Current efficiencies as high as 90% or more can be obtained in<br>
favourable circumstances. Reduced hydrogen evolution is also advantageous<br>
from the safety standpoint and significantly reduces the amount of hydrogen<br>
embitterment that occurs in the substrate material during the electrochemical<br>
process. It also results in plated materials having an improved surface finish,<br>
with greatly diminished micro-cracking compared to electroplating produced by<br>
conventional methods. This in turn can improve the corrosion resistance of the<br>
coatings and/or allow the use of coatings which are thinner yet provide<br>
comparable corrosion resistance to that of conventional coatings, which thus<br>
are cheaper to produce, less consumptive of raw materials, and more<br>
environmentally friendly.<br>
Examples<br><br>
Preparation Example A - Preparation of semi-dry choline saccharinate<br>
ionic liquid<br>
1,080 g of sodium saccharinate hydrate (99%, ex Acros) were mixed with 732 g<br>
of solid choiine chloride (99%, ex Acros), using 6 I of acetone as solvent. After 8<br>
hours of agitating, allowing for ion exchange reaction to take place, the formed<br>
suspension was filtered. The filtrate was subjected to evaporation in a Rotavap<br>
at a temperature of about 60Â°C and minimal pressure of about 40 mbar until no<br>
further evaporation of the solvent was observed. The remaining product was a<br>
liquid and was confirmed to be choline saccharinate by elemental chemical<br>
composition analysis (chloride, sodium, and sulphur concentration).<br>
Preparation Example B - Preparation of dry choline saccharinate ionic<br>
liquid<br>
Sodium saccharinate hydrate (99%, ex Acros) was dried at a temperature of<br>
120oC until no further decrease in mass was observed, in order to remove any<br>
water present. After that the dry sodium saccharinate was mixed with choline<br>
chloride (99%, ex Acros), in 1:1 molar ratio, using acetone as solvent. After 8<br>
hours of agitating, allowing for ion exchange reaction to take place, the formed<br>
suspension was filtered. The filtrate was subjected to evaporation in a Rotavap<br>
at a temperature of about 85Â°C and minimal pressure of about 40 mbar until no<br>
further evaporation of the solvent was observed. The remaining product was a<br>
liquid and was confirmed to be dry choline saccharinate by elemental chemical<br>
composition analysis (chloride, sodium, and sulphur concentration, and also<br>
water concentration).<br><br>
Example 1 - Electroplating of copper onto brass in a semi-dry choline<br>
saccharinate<br>
Into prepared choline saccharinate ionic liquid that contained around 2 wt% of<br>
water, copper (II) chloride dihydrate salt was charged and the mixture was<br>
stirred until the solid salt dissolved. In the prepared solution the concentration of<br>
copper was around 11 g/kg, whereas the molar ratio of the amine salt to the<br>
copper-hydrated salt was 21:1.<br>
Around 250 ml of the solution was poured into a Hull cell equipped with an<br>
electrical heating element which had a length of 65 mm on the anode side and<br>
102 mm on the cathode side, a 48 mm shortest anode-cathode distance, a 127<br>
mm longest anode-cathode distance, and a depth of 65 mm. The cell was<br>
heated to a temperature between 70 and 80Â°C. The liquid was agitated using a<br>
centrally positioned top-entering impeller.<br>
Platinised titanium plate was applied as the anode and connected to the<br>
positive terminal of a DC power source, whereas brass plate was used as the<br>
cathode (substrate) and connected to the negative terminal. Prior to introduction<br>
into the bath, the substrate plate was cleaned with a commercial scouring<br>
powder, washed in demineralised water, in acetone and after that in ethanol,<br>
and finally in a 4 M-HCI aqueous solution. When both plates were connected<br>
and introduced into the cell, the voltage difference was set to 30 V. The current<br>
flow was monitored on a meter connected in series.<br>
After 1.5 hours of electroplating, the cathode was disconnected from the power<br>
source and taken out of the cell. The plate was washed in water and acetone<br>
and then dried. On the portion of the plate submerged in the ionic liquid during<br>
electroplating, an orangy/brown copper-deposited layer was observed. The<br>
thickness of the layer decreased from one side of the plate to the other due to<br>
the differences in current density at different positions of the cathode.<br><br>
Example 2 - Electroplating of chromium from Cr (III) salt onto carbon steel<br>
in a wet choline saccharinate<br>
Into a prepared choline saccharinate ionic liquid that contained around 7 wt% of<br>
water chromium (III) chloride hexahydrate salt was charged and the mixture<br>
was stirred until the solid salt dissolved. To increase the ratio of the amine salt<br>
to the chromium salt and at the same time improve the solubility of chromium<br>
salt, choline chloride was added. In the prepared solution the concentration of<br>
chromium (III) was around 20 g/kg, whereas the molar ratio of the amine salt to<br>
the chromium hydrated salt was 9:1.<br>
Around 250 ml of the solution was poured into the Hull cell described in<br>
Example 1. The cell was heated to a temperature between 70 and 80Â°C. The<br>
liquid was agitated using a centrally positioned top-entering impeller.<br>
Platinised titanium plate was applied as the anode and connected to the<br>
positive terminal of a DC power source, whereas carbon steel was used as the<br>
cathode (substrate) and connected to the negative terminal. Prior to introduction<br>
into the bath, the substrate plate was cleaned with a commercial scouring<br>
powder, washed in demineralised water, in acetone and after that in ethanol,<br>
and finally in a 4 M-HCI aqueous solution. When both plates were connected<br>
and introduced into the cell, the voltage difference was set to 30 V. The current<br>
flow was monitored on a meter connected in series.<br>
After 5 hours of electroplating, the cathode was disconnected from the power<br>
source and taken out of the cell. The plate was washed in water and acetone<br>
and then dried. On the portion of the plate submerged in the ionic liquid during<br>
the electroplating, a light grey (metallic colour) deposited layer was observed.<br>
The thickness of the layer decreased from one side of the plate to the other due<br>
to the differences in current density at different positions of the cathode, having<br>
no visible layer at one side. The chemical composition of the plate was<br>
analysed by scanning electron microscopy combined with X-ray dispersion<br>
(SEM/EDX).<br><br>
The analysis confirmed the presence of chromium at the submerged portion of<br>
the substrate (Figure 1a), whereas no chromium was found at the non-<br>
submerged surface (Figure 1b).<br>
Example 3 - Electroplating of chromium from Cr (III) salt onto carbon steel<br>
in a semi-dry choline saccharinate<br>
Into a prepared choline saccharinate ionic liquid that contained around 2 wt% of<br>
water chromium (III) chloride hexahydrate salt was charged and the mixture<br>
was stirred until the solid salt dissolved. In the prepared solution the<br>
concentration of chromium (III) was around 12 g/kg, whereas the molar ratio of<br>
the amine salt to the chromium hydrated salt was 13:1.<br>
Around 250 ml of the solution was poured into the Hull cell described in<br>
Example 1. The cell was heated to a temperature between 70 and 80Â°C. The<br>
liquid was agitated using a centrally positioned top-entering impeller.<br>
Platinised titanium plate was applied as the anode and connected to the<br>
positive terminal of a DC power source, whereas carbon steel was used as the<br>
cathode (substrate) and connected to the negative terminal. Prior to introduction<br>
into the bath, the substrate plate was cleaned with a commercial scouring<br>
powder, washed in demineralised water, in acetone and after that in ethanol,<br>
and finally in a 4 M-HCI aqueous solution. When both plates were connected<br>
and introduced into the cell, the voltage difference was set to 30 V. The current<br>
flow was monitored on a meter connected in series.<br>
After 5 hours of electroplating, the cathode was disconnected from the power<br>
source and taken out of the cell. The plate was washed in water and acetone<br>
and then dried. The chemical analysis by scanning electron microscopy<br>
combined with X-ray dispersion (SEM/EDX) indicated the presence of a very<br>
thin deposited layer.<br><br>
Comparative Example 4 - Electroplating of chromium from Cr (III) salt onto<br>
carbon steel in a 2:1 molar ratio eutectic mixture of chromium (III) chloride<br>
hexahvdrate and choline chloride<br>
Chromium (III) chloride hexahydrate and choline chloride were mixed in a 2:1<br>
molar ratio. The solid mixture was heated for several hours in an oven at a<br>
temperature of around 120Â°C. The mixture was shaken from time to time, until<br>
no more solids were observed. The dark green liquid product was cooled down<br>
to room temperature.<br>
Example 2 was repeated, but using the produced eutectic mixture of 2:1 molar<br>
ratio of chromium (III) chloride hexahydrate and choline chloride instead of the<br>
solution used in Example 2.<br>
In Figure 2 the appearance of the substrates of Example 2 and Comparative<br>
Example 4 is illustrated. It is clearly demonstrated that the method in<br>
accordance with the present invention results in an improved visual appearance<br>
of the plated substrate (shiny metallic instead of dark mat deposit).<br>
Example 5 - Electroplating of chromium from CrCl3 hexahydrate salt onto<br>
carbon steel in cocoalkylmethyl [polyoxyethylene(15)] ammonium<br>
chloride<br>
Chromium (III) chloride hexahydrate salt was added to cocoalkylmethyl<br>
[polyoxyethylene(15)] ammonium chloride ionic liquid containing 0.2 wt% of<br>
water and the mixture was agitated at a temperature of around 50Â°C until the<br>
solid salt dissolved. In the prepared solution the concentration of chromium (III)<br>
chloride hexahydrate was 75 g/kg.<br>
Around 250 ml of that solution was poured into the Hull cell described in<br>
Example 1. The cell was heated to a temperature between 70 and 80Â°C.<br>
Platinised titanium plate was applied as the anode and connected to the<br>
positive terminal of a DC power source, whereas carbon steel was used as the<br>
cathode (substrate) and connected to the negative terminal. Prior to introduction<br><br>
into the bath, the substrate plate was cleaned with a commercial scouring<br>
powder, washed in demoralised water, in acetone and after that in ethanol,<br>
and finally in a 4 M-HCI aqueous solution. When both plates were connected<br>
and introduced into the ceil, the voltage difference was set to 30 V. The liquid<br>
was agitated using a centrally positioned top-entering impeller. The current flow<br>
between the electrodes was monitored on a meter connected in series.<br>
After 18 hours of electroplating, the cathode was disconnected from the power<br>
source and taken out of the cell. The plate was washed in water and acetone<br>
and then dried. Chemical analysis by scanning electron microscopy combined<br>
with X-ray dispersion (SEM/EDX) of the substrate was performed. Both the<br>
submerged and the non-submerged part of the plate were analysed. On the<br>
non-submerged part only iron, carbon, and oxygen were found, whereas the<br>
submerged part contained chromium, iron, carbon, and oxygen, confirming the<br>
deposition of the chromium onto the substrate. In addition to that, a coverage of<br>
the submerged part of the plate by a metallic layer could be observed visually.<br>
Example 6 - Electroplating of chromium using CrCI2 as a source of<br>
chromium onto carbon steel in cocoalkylmethyl [polyoxyethylene(15)]<br>
ammonium chloride<br>
Dry chromium (ll) chloride was added to cocoalkylmethyl [polyoxyethylene(15)]<br>
ammonium chloride ionic liquid containing 0.2 wt% of water and the mixture was<br>
agitated at a temperature of around 50oC until the solid salt cculd be considered<br>
dissolved. In the prepared solution the concentration of chromium (II) chloride<br>
was 30 g/kg.<br>
Around 250 ml gf that solution was poured into the Hull cell described in<br>
Example 1. The cell was heated to a temperature between 70 and 80oC.<br>
Platinised titanium plate was applied as the anode and connected to the<br>
positive terminal of a DC power source, whereas carbon steel was used as the<br>
cathode (substrate) and connected to the negative terminal. Prior to introduction<br>
into the bath, the substrate plate was cleaned with a commercial scouring<br><br>
powder, washed in demineralised water, in acetone and after that in ethanol,<br>
and finally in a 4 M-HCI aqueous solution. When both plates were connected<br>
and introduced into the cell, the voltage difference was set to 30 V. The liquid<br>
was agitated using a centrally positioned top-entering impeller. The current flow<br>
between the electrodes was monitored on a meter connected in series.<br>
After 18 hours of electroplating, the cathode was disconnected from the power<br>
source and taken out of the cell. The plate was washed in water and acetone<br>
and then dried. On the portion of the plate submerged in the ionic liquid during<br>
the electroplating, a light bluish-grey metallic deposited layer was observed to<br>
cover more than 95% of the area. Chemical analysis by scanning electron<br>
microscopy combined with X-ray dispersion (SEM/EDX) of the substrate was<br>
performed. Both the submerged and the non-submerged part of the plate were<br>
analysed. On the non-submerged part iron, carbon, and oxygen were found,<br>
whereas the submerged part contained chromium, iron, and carbon, confirming<br>
the deposition of the chromium onto the substrate<br>
Example 7 - Electroplating of chromium using CrCI3 hexahydrate as a<br>
source of chromium onto carbon steel in wet cocoalkylmethyl [polyoxy-<br>
ethylene(15)] ammonium methylsulphate<br>
Chromium (III) chloride hexahydrate was charged to cocoalkylmethyl [polyoxy-<br>
ethylene(15)] ammonium methylsulphate ionic liquid into which 10 wt% of water<br>
was introduced prior to the addition of chromium salt. The mixture was agitated<br>
at a temperature of around 50Â°C until the solid salt dissolved. In the prepared<br>
solution the concentration of chromium (III) chloride hexahydrate was 74 g/kg.<br>
Around 250 ml of that solution was poured into the Hull cell described in<br>
Example 1. The cell was heated to a temperature between 70 and 80 Â°C.<br>
Platinised titanium plate was applied as the anode and connected to the<br>
positive terminal of a DC power source, whereas carbon steel was used as the<br>
cathode (substrate) and connected to the negative terminal. Prior to introduction<br>

non-submerged part iron, carbon, and oxygen were found. whereas the<br>
submerged part contained chromium, iron, carbon, and oxygen, confirming the<br>
deposition of the chromium onto the substrate.<br>
Example 9 - Electroplating of chromium using chromium anode<br>
(chromium metal chips) as a source of chromium onto carbon steel in<br>
cocoalkyl methyl [polyoxyethylene(15)] ammonium chloride<br>
Around 250 ml of cocoalkylmethyl [polyoxyethylene(15)] ammonium chloride<br>
ionic liquid containing 0.2 wt% of water was poured into the Hull cell described<br>
the Example 1. The cell was heated to a temperature between 70 and 80oC<br>
Chromium metal chips, 2 mm thick, were charged into a titanium basket. This<br>
basket was applied as the anode and connected to the positive terminal of a DC<br>
power source, whereas carbon steel was used as the cathode (substrate) and<br>
connected to the negative terminal. Prior to introduction into the bath, the<br>
substrate plate was cleaned with a commercial scouring powder, washed in<br>
demineralised water, in acetone and after that in ethanol, and finally in a 4 M-<br>
HCl aqueous solution. When both plates were connected and introduced into<br>
the cell, the voltage difference was set to 30 V. The liquid was agitated using a<br>
centrally positioned tap-entering impeller. The current flow between the<br>
electrodes was monitored on a meter connected in series.<br>
After 5 hours of electroplating, the cathode was disconnected from the power<br>
source and taken out of the cell. The plate was washd in water and acetone<br><br>
and then dried. Chemical analysis by scanning electron microscopy combined<br>
with X-ray dispersion (SEM/EDX) of the substrate was performed. Both the<br>
submerged and the non-submerged part of the plate were analysed. On the<br>
non-submerged part iron, carbon, and oxygen were found, whereas the<br>
submerged part contained chromium, iron, carbon, and oxygen, confirming the<br>
deposition of the chromium onto the substrate.<br>

Example 5 was repeated, but using N-methyl-N-trioctylammonium<br>
bis(trifluoromethyisulphony!)imide ionic liquid (98%, ex Solvent Innovation)<br>
instead of cocoalkylmethyl [polyoxyethylene(15)] ammonium chloride ionic liquid<br>
as used in Example 5.<br>
After 18 hours of electroplating, the cathode was disconnected from the power<br>
source and taken out of the cell. The plate was washed in water and acetone<br>
and then dried. Chemical analysis by scanning electron microscopy combined<br>
with X-ray dispersion (SEM/EDX) of the substrate was performed. Both the<br>
submerged and the non-submerged part of the plate were analysed. No<br>
chromium was found on any part of the plate. Hence, no detectable chromium<br>
deposition occurred. As under the same conditions and with the same<br>
chromium source applied (Example 5) a chromium deposit was formed when<br>
using cocoalkylmethyl [polyoxyethylene(15)] ammonium chloride ionic liquid,<br>
which is covered in the present patent, the advantage of the method in<br>
