COMPOSITION<br>
Field of the present invention<br>
The present invention relates to a synergistic composition useful as plant and soil<br>
health enhancer using cow urine and application thereof for promoting plant growth<br>
and controlling plant pathogenic fungi, said composition comprising urine, neem and<br>
garlic, individually or in all possible combinations, with the treatment showing<br>
stimulation of the accumulation of nutrients in the plant biomass, proliferation of<br>
plant growth promoting, phosphate solubilizing, abiotic stress tolerant and antagonists<br>
towards plant pathogenic fungi in the rhizosphere of plants, and enhances the total<br>
phenolic contents of the plants; further, a method of producing said composition<br>
thereof.<br>
Background and prior art of the present invention<br>
Farming is the oldest wealth-creating business known to man. Current scientific<br>
strategies to maintain and improve yields in support of high-input agriculture place<br>
great emphasis on 'fail-safe' techniques for each component of the production<br>
sequence with little consideration of the integration of these components in a holistic,<br>
systems approach. Research for sustainable agricultural practices requires a far greater<br>
emphasis on such an approach than now is fashionable, despite all the rhetoric given<br>
politically to sustainability.<br>
The populations of the world's poorest countries have been growing rapidly,<br>
increasing the demand for food. At the same time environmental degradation - both<br>
natural and man made - has reduced the ability of farmers to grow food in many<br>
areas. A lot has been written about the significant contribution due to "Green<br>
Revolution" and correctly so, especially considering our failure to control<br>
unsustainable population growth. Thanks due to the high yielding varieties we are still<br>
self-sufficient in rice and wheat, but for how long? Hardly any one argues that<br>
modern agriculture is sustainable. Besides, high input agriculture is increasingly<br>
recognized as an environment degrading and not profitable. We now recognize that<br>
technical progress may have social and environmental costs we cannot pay. People<br>
are now seriously concerned with the protection of the environment and even more<br>
about safeguarding their health. As now people realize that by consuming the standard<br>
agriculture based food products they are constantly taking in small quantities of<br>
poison of various kinds and much of this comes from the chemical pesticides that are<br>
used to produce food crops.<br>
Modern farming requires large inputs of chemical fertilizer and stimulants to increase<br>
yields from hybrids. However for poor rural marginal farmers the use of chemical<br>
fertilizers and pesticides have made agriculture very expensive and to maintain yields<br>
in deteriorating soils increasing doses of modern chemical inputs have had to be used.<br>
The time has now come to consider alternative means of sustaining our agriculture<br>
and to protect the farmer from low prices, high indebtedness and to ensure that<br>
production incentives remain. For small farmers, organic farming is most suitable as<br>
considerable vertical integration is possible and appreciable cost savings could be<br>
achieved through the recycling of waste and other materials that are available within<br>
the system.<br>
A considerable amount of literature is available on the practice of organic farming.<br>
Where organic farming is practiced, the farmer will use natural processes to enhance<br>
productivity, maintain the nutritive status of the soil to be less dependent on external<br>
resources and to keep his costs down. This will strengthen his social and financial<br>
position in the society. Organic farming uses natural materials which are the by<br>
products of the farm and are environmentally safe, it enhances the nutritive qualities<br>
of the soil and it nurtures the organisms in the soils, which are generally destroyed by<br>
the use of chemical manures and pesticides, and significantly reduces cost. Therefore<br>
at this juncture further work on the development of agriculture biotechnology<br>
products based on cow offers immense potential as viable alternative for sustainable<br>
agriculture.<br>
We have observed serendipitously that when cow urine is applied to seedlings of<br>
plants, it enhances overall growth of the plant and protects plants from plant<br>
pathogenic fungi. Experiments were undertaken to investigate the significance of<br>
these observations. According to Hindu mythology as well as the Indian traditional<br>
agricultural practices Vrikshayurveda of Surapala, an ancient Sanskrit text on the<br>
science of plant life describes the use of milk in changing the flower color and<br>
enhancing fruit taste [N. Sadhale (1996) Surapala's Vrikshayurveda (translated by N.<br>
Sadhale) Secunderabad, India: Asian Agri-History Foundation]. Panchgavya, a<br>
mixture of five cow products namely, dung, urine, milk, curd and ghee (clarified<br>
butter) is used in human medicine, to improve soil health and to protect plants from<br>
diseases [S. N. Singh (1971) Krishi-Parashar (translated by S. N. Singh). Varanasi,<br>
India: Jai Bharat Press]. Systematic collection and use of urine for fertilization<br>
purposes only dates back approximately one century. More than 90% of the total N<br>
content in urine is NH4<br>
+-N. Also the K is predominantly present in inorganic form.<br>
This means that urine is comparable to commercial inorganic N and K fertilizer. The<br>
average K content in cattle urine is 0.7%, and when urine is applied to old grass sods<br>
strong effects are often seen - effects that have often been confused with an N effect -<br>
although it is primarily a K response.<br>
Plants have remained central to every civilization as the primary source of life, due to<br>
their numerous applications in daily life. Plants are composed of chemical substances<br>
of which some are not directly beneficial for the growth and development of the<br>
organism. These secondary compounds have usually been regarded as a part of the<br>
plants' defense against plant-feeding insects and other herbivores [G. A. Rosenthal<br>
and D. H. Janzen (eds.) 1979 Herbivores: their interaction with secondary plant<br>
metabolites. Academic Press, New York]. The pesticidal properties of many plants<br>
have been known for a long time and natural pesticides based on plant extracts such<br>
as rotenone, nicotine and pyrethrum have been commonly used in pest control.<br>
Jacobson has reviewed literature on pesticides from more than 3000 plant species [M.<br>
Jacobson and D. G. Crosby (eds.) 1971. Naturally occurring insecticides. Dekker Inc.<br>
New York].<br>
Neem (Azadirachta indicd) is so far the most promising example of plants currently<br>
used for pest control. Neem has remained for numerous purposes in Indian society<br>
and is known since ancient times in Sanskrit as "Arishta" meaning health bestower. A<br>
summary of how neem products are used as bio-pesticides, the mode of action, effect<br>
on pests and natural enemies has been prepared by Schmutterer [H. Schmutterer<br>
(1990) Annual Review of Entomology 35: 271-297]. Many agrochemical,<br>
therapeutic, and medicinal uses of neem are known [U.P. Singh and D. P. Singh<br>
(2002) Journal of Herbal Pharamcotherapy, 2: 13-28]. Disease caused by various<br>
microorganisms such as fungi, bacteria, and viruses not only damage the plant as a<br>
whole but also severely affect quality of the crop. A number of physiological and<br>
biochemical alterations in the plants have been reported due to infection of the fungi,<br>
bacteria, and viruses [H. Schmutterer. Neem products for integrated pest management.<br>
In The Neem Tree: Source of unique natural products for integrated pest management,<br>
medicine and other purposes (Schmutterer, H., Ed.). VCH Verlagsgesellschaft,<br>
Weinheim, Germany. 1997; pp. 367-477]. Furthermore, control measures adopted to<br>
combat plant diseases have serious public concern because of the indiscriminate use<br>
of the synthetic pesticides. This has resulted in the intensive search to find the<br>
alternative methods for disease control and use of plant products in controlling plant<br>
pathogens could be a viable alternative [U. P. Singh and B. Prithiviraj (1997)<br>
Physiological and Molecular Plant Pathology 51: 181-194]. Aqueous extracts of<br>
various parts of neem, e.g., leaf, bark, seed, pulp and inflorescence have been used<br>
successfully in vitro to inhibit the growth of various plant pathogenic fungi [U. P.<br>
Singh, R .B. Singh, and H. B. Singh (1980) Mycologia 72: 1077-1093; U. P. Singh<br>
and H. B. Singh (1981) Australian Journal of Plant Pathology 10: 66-67].<br>
Like neem, the antibacterial and antifungal properties of garlic (Allium sativum L)<br>
against human and plant pathogens are also well known [U. P. Singh, B. Prithviraj, B.<br>
K. Sarma, M. Singh and A. B. Ray (2001) Indian Journal of Experimental Biology 39:<br>
310-322]. Oil of garlic in natural and synthetic forms has been reported to suppress<br>
the activity of many air and soil-borne fungi [N. B. K. Murthy and S. V. Amonkar<br>
(1973) Indian Journal of Experimental Biology 12: 208-209]. Several other workers<br>
have observed the antimicrobial activity of extracts of garlic [M. R. Tansey and J. A.<br>
Appleton (1975) Mycologia 67: 409-413; H.B. Singh and U.P. Singh (1981)<br>
Australian Journal of Plant Pathology 10: 66-67]. Singh et al. [U. P. Singh, K. K.<br>
Pathak, M. N. Khare and R. B. Singh (1979) Mycologia 71: 556-564] have shown that<br>
even garlic-leaf extract significantly reduced the growth of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum<br>
and Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. ciceri. Padwick causing wilts in gram (Cicer<br>
arietinum L.). Inhibition of growth and sclerotium formation in Rhizoctonia solani by<br>
garlic oil has also been reported [H. B. Singh and U. P. Singh (1980) Mycologia 72:<br>
1022-1025].<br>
Improving soil fertility is one of the most common tactics to increase agricultural and<br>
forest production. Soil organisms, especially bacteria have a key role in determining<br>
the rate of organic matter decomposition and thereby nutrient mineralization. These<br>
processes determine the rate of nutrient supply to primary producers, largely<br>
determining the rate of biomass production and other fundamental ecosystem<br>
processes like interactions among different functional groups of organisms that<br>
constitute ecosystems [J. D. Bever, K. M. Westover and J. Antonovics (1997) Journal<br>
of Ecology 85: 561-573]. Therefore, elucidation of the mechanisms that determine<br>
species composition in plant communities is important. Rhizobacteria, once<br>
considered passive bystanders of the root environment, are now known to affect plant<br>
health, development, and environmental adaptation, both beneficially and<br>
detrimentally, and the importance of these bacteria in agriculture is expected to grow<br>
[D. J. O'Sullivan and F. O'Gara (1992) Microbiology Review 56: 662-676.; R. J. Cook<br>
(2000) Annual Review of Phytopathology 38: 95-116]. A variety of mechanisms have<br>
been identified as being responsible for such plant growth promoting activity. For<br>
example, certain microorganisms indirectly promote plant growth by inhibiting the<br>
growth of deleterious microorganisms; or directly enhance plant growth by producing<br>
growth hormones; and/or by assisting in the uptake of nutrients by the crops, e.g.,<br>
phosphorus (?) [C. S. Nautiyal et al., FEMS Microbiology Letters, Volume 182, pp.<br>
291-296 (2000)].<br>
Plant disease suppression mechanisms involved includes antibiotic and siderophoremediated<br>
suppression, and successful root colonization. A clear relationship has been<br>
established between the suppression of soil-borne diseases by bacteria and their<br>
densities in the rhizosphere [C. T. Bull, D. M. Weller and L. S. Thomashow (1991)<br>
Phytopathology 81: 954-959; B. J. Lugtenberg, L. Dekkers, L. and G. V. Bloemberg<br>
(2001) Annual Review of Phytopathology 39: 461-490]. We have observed that the<br>
effectiveness of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) strains in controlling<br>
soil-borne plant pathogens is generally related to their efficiency of root colonization<br>
[C. S. Nautiyal (1997) Current Microbiology 33: 1-6; C. S. Nautiyal (1997) Current<br>
Microbiology 35: 52-58; C. S. Nautiyal (1997) FEMS Microbiology Ecology 23: 145-<br>
158; C. S. Nautiyal (2002) U. S. patent 6495362].<br>
The ecology of rhizosphere competent bacteria is not yet well enough understood to<br>
predict the behavior and efficacy of PGPRs in phytosphere (leaf, stem, rhizosphere,<br>
and endorhizosphere) colonization and of the existence of crop specificity [C. S.<br>
Nautiyal (2000) In Biocontrol potential and its exploitation in sustainable agriculture.<br>
Edited by R.K. Upadhyay, K.G. Mukerji, and B.P. Chamola. Kluwer<br>
Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York. pp. 9-23]. Therefore, these findings suggest<br>
that rhizosphere microbial population is an important indicator of plant and soil health<br>
[C. S. Nautiyal, J. K Johri and H. B. Singh. Canadian Journal of Microbiology 48:<br>
588-601 (2002)].<br>
Microbial population studies can provide valuable information concerning the impact<br>
of introduced seed or soil treatment on indigenous microbial populations. Ideally,<br>
microbial population studies should be linked to broader aspects of ecosystem<br>
functioning, such as effects on plant growth, plant health, and nutrient cycling [M. N.<br>
Schroth and J. G. Hancock (1981) Annual Review of Phytopathology 35: 453-476; C.<br>
S. Nautiyal, J. K Johri and H. B. Singh. Canadian Journal of Microbiology 48: 588-<br>
601 (2002)]. Phenols have known to occur in all plants investigated so far. Some of<br>
them occur constitutively while others are formed in response to pathogen ingress and<br>
associated as part of an active defense response in the host [R. L. Nicholson and R.<br>
Hammerschmidt (1992) Annual Review of Phytopathology 30: 369-389]. There are<br>
also reports on a sudden increase in phenolic concentrations following inoculation<br>
with non-pathogenic organisms to the plants.<br>
Direct reduction in fungal growth due to changes in phenolics in the tomato in<br>
response to inoculation with Verticillium albo-atrum is available in literature [M. A.<br>
Bernards and B, E. Ellis (1989) Journal of Plant Physiology 135: 21-26]. Seed<br>
bacterization with rhi/obacteria results in greater accumulation of phenolic<br>
compounds or mediated induced systemic resistance (ISR) in hosts offer a practical<br>
way of immunizing plants against pathogen ingress [G. Wei, J. W. Klopper and S.<br>
Tazun (1991) Phytopathology 81: 1508-1512] Recently we have reported<br>
rhizobacteria elicited alterations in phenolics of chickpea infected by Sclerotium<br>
rolfsii [B. K. Sarma, D. P. Singh, S. Merita, H. B. Singh and U. P. Singh (2002)<br>
Journal of Phytopathology 150: 277-282].<br>
Recently, effectiveness of cow's milk against zucchini squash (Cucurbita pepo)<br>
powdery mildew (Sphaerotheca fulgined) has been demonstrated in greenhouse<br>
conditions [W. Bettiol (1999) Crop Protection 18:489-492]. Cow milk may have more<br>
than one mode of action in controlling zucchini squash powdery mildew. Fresh milk<br>
may have a direct effect against S. fulginea due to its germicidal properties [A. J.<br>
Salle (1954) Fundamental principles of bacteriology. New York: McGraw-Hill]. Milk<br>
contains several salts and amino acids. These substances have been shown to be<br>
effective in controlling powdery mildew and other diseases [A. J. Salle (1954)<br>
Fundamental principles of bacteriology. New York: McGraw-Hill]. Several authors<br>
have shown that sodium bicarbonate, oxalate, dibasic or tribasic potassium phosphate,<br>
and other salts and amino acids have been efficient in the induction of systematic<br>
resistance [A. J. Salle (1954) Fundamental principles of bacteriology. New York:<br>
McGraw-Hill: van Andel (1966) Annual Review of Phytopathology 4;349-368; M.<br>
Reuveni, V. Agapov, R. Reuveni (1995) Plant Pathology 44:31-39].<br>
India is one of the few countries in world, which has contributed richly to the<br>
International livestock gene pool and improvement of animal population in world.<br>
Cattle and buffalo contribute nearly 15% of the gross national income. The country<br>
possesses 23% of world bovine population. Sahiwal is one of the most popular breeds<br>
of cow of the subcontinent. It has been exported to Sri Lanka, Kenya and many<br>
countries in Latin America and West Indies where a new breed called Jamaica Hope<br>
has been evolved out of Sahiwal and Jersey crossbreeds [P.N. Bhat, Handbook of<br>
Animal Husbandry, Directorate of Publication and Information on Agriculture. Krishi<br>
Anusandhan Bhawan, Pusa, New Delhi, India (1997)]. Thus the traditional<br>
information about the use of cow urine an important bio matter which can be used<br>
methodically to get better result in controlling plant pathogenic fungi and promoting<br>
plant growth should not be ignored.<br>
While work on use of urine for promoting plant growth and controlling plant<br>
pathogenic fungi has been conducted in past there has been no clear indication<br>
heretofore that any detailed study has been conducted to demonstrate that urine from<br>
cow might act as stimulator of the accumulation of nutrients in the plant biomass,<br>
proliferation of plant growth promoting, phosphate solubilizing, abiotic stress tolerant<br>
and antagonists towards plant pathogenic fungi in the rhizosphere of plants, and<br>
enhances the total phenolic contents of the plants, per se. Nevertheless, a cow urinemediated<br>
promotion of plant growth and controlling plant pathogenic fungi, if one<br>
were discovered, could find immediate application, e.g., in soils affected by<br>
phytopathogens, poor nutrient availability in a desired improvement in crop<br>
development. We have found by direct comparison on a variety of plant types that the<br>
unique combination of selected plants with cow urine is effective in the enhancement<br>
of plant growth and soil health.<br>
The present invention relates to usage of urine from cow which acts as plant and soil<br>
health enhancer and application thereof for promoting plant growth and controlling<br>
plant pathogenic fungi, said composition comprising urine, neem and garlic,<br>
individually or in all possible combinations, the treatment showing stimulation of the<br>
accumulation of nutrients in the plant biomass, proliferation of plant growth<br>
promoting, phosphate solubilizing, abiotic stress tolerant and antagonists towards<br>
plant pathogenic fungi in the rhizosphere of plants, and enhances the total phenolic<br>
contents of the plants; and a method for producing the composition.<br>
Objects of the present invention<br>
The main object of the present invention is to develop a synergistic fermented<br>
composition useful in promoting plant growth, soil health and bio-controlling.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to develop a process of preparing<br>
synergistic fermented composition comprising cow urine, crushed neem leaves and/or<br>
crushed garlic bulbs, optionally along with carrier(s), useful in promoting plant<br>
growth.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to develop a method of promoting plant<br>
growth using bovine urine and/or crushed neem leaves and/or crushed garlic bulbs,<br>
optionally along with carrier(s).<br>
Summary of the present invention<br>

health enhancer, comprising urine, neem and garlic, individually or in all possible<br>
combinations, with the treatment showing it has the ability to stimulate accumulation<br>

solubilizing, abiotic stress tolerant and antagonists towards plant pathogenic fungi,<br>
control phytopathogenic fungi in the rhizosphere of plants, and enhances the total<br>
phenolic contents of the plants.<br>

It has been discovered that usage of urine from cow acts as plant and soil health<br>
enhancer. Application of cow urine results in promoting plant growth and controlling<br>
plant pathogenic fungi, said composition comprising urine, neem leaves and garlic,<br>
individually or in all possible combinations, stimulation of proliferation of plant<br>

and antagonists towards plant pathogenic fungi in the rhizosphere of plants, and<br>
enhances the total phenolic contents of the plants.<br>
First fresh urine from healthy indigenous (Sahiwal) cows was collected in morning<br>
into clean plastic container. The 1 liter urine was poured into 2 liter capacity copper<br>
vessel buried in soil up to its neck for its fermentation up to 30 days, along with neem<br>
(250 gm leaves/liter) and/or garlic (100 gm crushed bulbs/liter). After 30 days, using<br>
the fermented product either directly or boiling it to concentrate to 0.25 liter, before<br>
its application. In yet another combination cow urine was fermented along with neem<br>
leaves and/or crushed garlic bulbs for 30 days in 2 liter capacity earthen vessel buried<br>
in soil up to its neck. After 30 days, using the fermented product either directly or<br>
boiling it to concentrate to 0.25 liter, before its application. In yet another<br>
combination fermenting neem leaves and/or crushed garlic bulbs with water. After 30<br>
days, using the fermented product either directly or boiling it to concentrate to 0.25<br>
liter, before its application. Thus 12 treatments were prepared using urine, neem<br>
leaves and/or crushed garlic bulbs individually in copper or earthen pot, each, to a<br>
final total of 24 treatments.<br>
Twenty-four treatments prepared in the previous step are screened to select those,<br>
which at a particular concentration promote plant growth under greenhouse conditions<br>
as described earlier [C. S. Nautiyal, J. K Johri and H. B. Singh. Canadian Journal of<br>
Microbiology, Volume 48, pp. 588-601 (2002)]. In this test seeds of chickpea are<br>
grown in non-sterilized soil and treated individually, at a concentration of 1:100<br>
dilution. Barthen pots (of 25 cm diameter) have been found to be of a convenient size<br>
to grow chickpea and other plants for the greenhouse test. Each pot was filled with<br>
non-sterilized soil. Although sterile soil or any other plant growth supporting material<br>
for example like vermiculite may also be used instead of non-sterile soil, it is<br>
preferred that non-sterile soil from the field where these treatments are intended to be<br>
applied is used in greenhouse test. Tap water was added to each hole before planting<br>
seeds to adjust the dry soil to 20% moisture with the 24 treatments individually<br>
diluted to 1:100. Tap water for control and diluted treatment was added before<br>
planting seeds to adjust the dry soil to 15 to 30% moisture. Preferred soil moisture is<br>
20%. Six seeds were added per pot. Data was recorded after 21 days of plant growth<br>
with respect to plant height and weight and as plant growth promoter those treatments<br>
were selected which cause the treated plants to exhibit greater dry weight.<br>
Next the treatment selected in the previous step is evaluated for its plant growth<br>
promotion ability of chickpea, maize, wheat and pea in greenhouse using different<br>
dilution in the range of 0 to 1:1000 and selecting those treatments, which at a<br>
particular concentration promote plant growth under greenhouse conditions as<br>
described earlier [C. S. Nautiyal, Current Microbiology, Volume 34, pp. 12-17<br>
(1997)]. In this test seeds of chickpea, maize, wheat and pea are grown in nonsterilized<br>
soil. Trays (35x35 cm.) with 16 (4x4) places per tray (each space was of 7<br>
cm. width, 10 cm. depth and 1 cm. apart from each other) have been found to be of a<br>
convenient size to grow chickpea, maize, wheat and pea and other plants for the<br>
greenhouse test. Each place was filled up to 8 cm. with non-sterilized soil.<br>
Although sterile soil or any other plant growth supporting material for example like<br>
vermiculite may also be used instead of non-sterile soil, it is preferred that non-sterile<br>
soil from the Held where these treatments are intended to be applied is used in<br>
greenhouse test. Data was noted after 30 days of plant growth with respect to plant<br>
height and weight and as plant growth promoter those treatments were selected which<br>
cause the treated plants to exhibit greater dry weight.<br>
Next, the treatments urine + neem and urine + neem + garlic fermented in earthen<br>
vessel showing good plant growth promotion are subjected to a screening for their<br>
ability to suppress phytopathogenic fungi suppressing growth of Fusarium oxysporum<br>
f. sp. ciceri, Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. gladioli, Fusarium moniliforme, Alternaria<br>
solani, Alternaria alternata, Phytophthora palmivora, Phytophthora nicotianae,<br>
Sclerotima scleroiiorum, Sclerotium rolfsii, Colletotrichum falcatum, Colletotrichum<br>
capsici, Penicillium sp., Aspergillus niger, Rhizoctonia solani, Pythium<br>
aphanidermatum, Curvularia hmata and Phoma sorghi under in vitro conditions as<br>
described earlier [C. S. Nautiyal (1997) Current Microbiology 35: 52-58; C. S.<br>
Nautiyal (1997) FEMS Microbiology Ecology 23: 145-158].<br>
An agar plug inoculum of the fungi to be tested (5-mm square) was then transferred to<br>
the center of the plate individually from a source plate of the fungi. Four holes (5 mm<br>
diameter) were bored on each NA plate. In each hole 100 uL of the treatments were<br>
individually added and in the 4th hole sterile water was added as a negative control.<br>
After incubation for 5 to 8 days inhibition zones were readily observed in the case of<br>
treatments having the biocontrol activity as the fungal growth around the hole was<br>
inhibited. While in case of treatments not having biocontrol activity and the hole<br>
sterile water was added as a negative control, fungal growth around the hole was not<br>
inhibited and the fungi grew around the edge of the hole.<br>
Concentrations of neem (50, 100, 250 and 500 gm/liter) and garlic (10, 50, 100 and<br>
250 gm/liter) in urine were further improved upon by using several combinations and<br>
amounts in earthen vessel under in vitro conditions for optimization of its ability to<br>
suppress pathogenic fungi and promote plant growth. Amount of neem -used is in the<br>
range of 50 to 500 gm/liter and for garlic 10 to 250 gm/liter. Preferred amount for<br>
neem and garlic is 250 and lOOgm/liter, respectively.<br>
Next the treatment containing urine + neem + garlic fermented in earthen vessel are<br>
subjected for its ability to inhibit growth of the sclerotia of Sclerotia rolfsii,<br>
Rhizoctonia .solani and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and chamydospores of Fusarium sp.<br>
under in vitro conditions by dipping three-week old similar sized<br>
sclerotia/charnydospores collected from NA plates after surface sterilized in various<br>
dilutions of the treatments individually, for up to 6 hrs; monitoring the viability of the<br>
sclerotia/chamydospores by removing and inoculating 3 batches of 15<br>
sclerotia/chamydospores on NA after incubation at 25°C for 7 days; recording the<br>
viability of sclerotia/chamydospores was recorded in terms of number of germinating<br>
sclerotia/chamydospores by visual examination of mycelial growth after 7 days.<br>
The 24 treatments were further tested for their ability to inhibit growth of Sclerotium<br>
rolfsii by seed soaking and soil drenching treatment to control collar rot of chickpea<br>
seedlings in greenhouse by dipping in 10% dilutions of the treatments individually, as<br>
indicated for 2 hrs; for soil drenching treatment adjusting the dry pot soil moisture to<br>
20% with the product diluted 1:100 individually, as stated.<br>
Various concentrations of the treatment containing urine + neem + garlic fermented in<br>
earthen vessel by foliar spray treatment for its ability to control leaf spot disease of<br>
field grown plant.<br>
Effect of addition of boiled urine + neem + garlic fermented in earthen vessel on the<br>
plant health, rhizosphere microorganisms and accumulation of N and P of chickpea<br>
plants was evaluated. Plant health and the population of rhizosphere microflora was<br>
estimated by a previously described procedure [C. S. Nautiyal, J. K Johri and H. B.<br>
Singh. Canadian Journal of Microbiology 48: 588-601 (2002)] Total N was<br>
determined by the Kjeldahl method [J. M. Bremner and C. S. Mulvancy (1982)<br>
Nitrogen-total, p. 595-624. In A. L. Page (ed.), Methods of soil analysis, part 2, 2nd<br>
ed.. Agronomy, no. 9, American Society of Agronomy, Madison, Wis., U.S.A.]. Plant<br>
tissues were digested in a mixture of 15 ml of HC1O4 and 5 ml of HNOs and<br>
phosphorus was determined colorimetrically by the vanado-molybdate method [H. L.<br>
S. Tandon, M. P. Cescas and E. H. Tyner (1968) Soil Science Society of America<br>
Proceedings 32: 48-51].<br>
Next boiled urine + neem + garlic fermented in earthen vessel is added-to the soil to<br>
elucidate its effect on rhizosphere microorganisms by determining the percentage of<br>
bacteria among the resident population, demonstrating plant growth promotion,<br>
phosphate solubilization, abiotic stress tolerance and antagonism towards plant<br>
pathogenic fungi. Chickpea plants were grown for 4 weeks in the presence and<br>
absence of 1:10 diluted boiled urine + neem + garlic fermented in earthen vessel.<br>
To isolate rhizosphere bacteria chickpea roots were thoroughly washed with tap water<br>
for two minutes to remove all loosely adhering soil particles, followed by washing<br>
with sterile 0.85% (w/v) saline Milli Q water (MQW). The roots were then macerated<br>
in 0.85% saline MQW with a mortar and pestle. Serial dilutions of the homogenate<br>
were then plated on NA agar plates as described earlier [C. S. Nautiyal (1997) Current<br>
Microbiology 33: 1-6]. One thousand bacterial representatives of the predominant<br>
morphologically distinct colonies present on the plates were selected from NA plates<br>
and purified by sub culturing an individual strain on NA plates to obtain a pure<br>
culture for further screening.<br>
Each isolate was stored in an aqueous solution of 30% glycerol at -25°C. One<br>
thousand bacterial strains were used to determine the % of gram-positive and gramnegative<br>
bacteria present in the heterogenous population of the bacteria. Out of 1000<br>
bacterial strains 100 bacterial representatives of the predominant morphologically<br>
distinct colonies were randomly used to determine the changes in the % of bacteria<br>
among the resident population demonstrating plant growth promotion, phosphate<br>
solubilization, abiotic stress tolerance and antagonism towards plant pathogenic fungi.<br>
Individual strains of the 100 bacteria were subjected to screening for selecting<br>
bacteria having potential for plant growth promotion. Bacterial inoculum for maize<br>
(Zea mays) seeds was prepared by scraping 48 h grown culture from plates with 10 ml<br>
of 0.85% saline water. Maize seeds were surface sterilized by gently shaking (80<br>
R.P.M. on a reciprocal shaker at 28°C) with 70% ethanol (5 min.), 20% bleach<br>
Chlorox (10 min.), followed by three rinses in sterile water. After surface sterilization<br>
seeds were soaked in the bacterial suspension (IxlO8 CFU/ml) for 4h at 28°C on a<br>
reciprocal shaker at 100 R.P.M. Control seeds (non bacterized) were soaked in 0.85%<br>
saline water washed from uninoculated plates. Bacterization levels of seeds were<br>
determined by agitating 4 seeds from each treatment and plated after serial dilution on<br>
NA plate. Mean cfu/seed were determined by averaging the cfu/gm values of three<br>
populations in three replicates per treatment after 48 h incubation of the plates at<br>
28°C. Tap water was added to each hole before planting seeds to adjust-the soil to 15<br>
to 30% moisture.<br>
Preferred soil moisture is 20%. Trays (35x35 cm.) with 16 (4x4) places per tray (each<br>
space was of 7 cm. width, 10 cm. depth and 1 cm. apart from each other) were used,<br>
to grow maize. Bach place was filled up to 8 cm. with non-sterilized soil. Tap water<br>
(25 ml.) was added to each hole before planting seeds to adjust the soil to 20%<br>
moisture. Four bacterized seed was added per hole. The experiment in greenhouse<br>
was carried out in four different sets of 16 maize seedlings each, for non-bacterized<br>
(control) and bacterized seeds. In each set, data of 21-days-old seedlings was noted<br>
with respect to dry weight of plants. For the bacterial strains to be plant growth<br>
promoter, the bacterized seedlings must have averaged at least 10% higher dry weight<br>
than comparable non-bacteri/ed plants [C. S. Nautiyal, J. K Johri and H. B. Singh.<br>
Canadian Journal of Microbiology 48: 588-601 (2002)].<br>
Quantitative estimation of phosphate solubilization capability of the 100 bacterial<br>
strains was carried out in triplicate by using National Botanical Research Institute's<br>
Phosphate solubilizing medium (NBRIP) in broth. The method has been described by<br>
Mehta and Nautiyal [S. Mehta and C. S. Nautiyal (2001) Current Microbiology 43:51-<br>
56],<br>
Next individual strains of the 100 bacteria were subjected to screening for abiotic<br>
stress tolerance. The stress tolerance of the strains towards salt (NaCl), pH, and<br>
temperature was tested by growing them individually on nutrient broth (NB) under<br>
various stress conditions, e.g., like 6% salt (NaCl), pH (3 and 11), and at temperature<br>
(5 and 55°C) stress were grown overnight (14-16 hrs). For 6% salt (NaCl), pH (3 and<br>
11) stress cultures were grown overnight at 30°C. Serial dilutions of each sample were<br>
spotted (25 ul) onto NA plates, and incubated at 30°C in triplicate as described earlier<br>
[C. S. Nautiyal, J. K Johri and H. B. Singh. Canadian Journal of Microbiology 48:<br>
588-601 (2002)]. Growth of bacterial strains having the abiotic stress tolerance ability<br>
was clearly visible with in 2-3 days of incubation of the plates at 30°C.<br>
Individual strains of the 100 bacteria were subjected to screening for bacteria having<br>
potential for suppressing phytopathogenic fungi namely Fusarmm oxysporiim f. sp.<br>
ciceri, Colletolnchum falcatum, Sclerotium rolfsii, Alternaria solani, Penicillium sp.,<br>
Pythium aphanidermatum, Phytophthora palmivora, Curvularia lunata, Sclerotinia<br>
sclerotiorum, Aspergillus niger and Phoma sorghi under in vitro conditions as<br>
described earlier [C. S. Nautiyal (1997) Current Microbiology 35: 52-58]. Bacterial<br>
colonies on NA plates were streaked around the edge of a 90-mm diameter petri plate<br>
and the plates were incubated at 28°C for 1 to 2 days. An agar plug inoculum of the<br>
fungi to be tested (5-mm square) was then transferred to the center of the plate<br>
individually from a source plate of the fungi. After incubation for 5 to 8 days<br>
i n h i b i t i o n /ones were readily observed in the case of bacterial strains having the<br>
biocontrol activity.<br>
Boiled urine + neem + garlic fermented in earthen vessel is added to the carriers to<br>
disperse the subject treatment such as peat, vermicompost and fermented press mud to<br>
15 to 45% moisture. Preferred moisture is 35% before its addition to soil as seed or<br>
furrow treatments. For furrow-treatment, formulation was directly applied all over the<br>
open furrow containing seeds and covered after treatment C. S. Nautiyal, J. K Johri<br>
and H. B. Singh. Canadian Journal of Microbiology 48: 588-601 (2002)]. Chickpea<br>
plants were grown for 4 weeks to elucidate its effect on rhizosphere microorganisms<br>
as described above by determining the percentage of bacteria among the resident<br>
population, demonstrating plant growth promotion, phosphate solubilization, and<br>
antagonism towards plant pathogenic fungi.<br>
Next effect of addition of boiled urine + neem + garlic fermented in earthen vessel<br>
was evaluated on the total phenolic contents of chickpea plants. In this test, seeds of<br>
chickpea are grown in non-sterilized soil and treated individually, at a concentration<br>
of 1:10 dilution. Earthen pots (of 25 cm diameter) have been found to be of a<br>
convenient size to grow chickpea and other plants for the greenhouse test. Each pot<br>
was filled with non-sterilized soil. Tap water was added to each hole before planting<br>
seeds to adjust the dry soil to 20% moisture with the 24 treatments individually<br>
diluted to 1:10, Tap water for control and diluted treatment was added to each hole<br>
before planting seeds to adjust the dry soil to 20%. Four seeds were added per hole.<br>
Data was noted after 30 days of plant growth with respect to total phenolic<br>
compounds in the leaf and root of treated chickpea, compared with un-treated control<br>
and total phenolics were estimated spectrophotometrically using the Prussian Blue<br>
method as modified by Graham [H. G. Graham (1992) Journal of Agriculture Food<br>
Chemistry Volume 40: 801-805].<br>
In addition to the other properties noted above, the unexpected and surprising<br>
attributes of these synergistic compositions include the following characteristics. All<br>
the treatments have been prepared from the urine of Sahiwal cow. The treatments<br>
promote plant growth and inhibit the growth of many pathogenic fungi of plants.<br>
These treatments promote plant growth and reduce the plant disease in soil both under<br>
greenhouse and field conditions. The treatments of the present invention are capable<br>
of stimulation of the accumulation of nutrients in the plant biomass, proliferation of<br>
plant growth promoting, phosphate solubilizing, abiotic stress tolerant and antagonists<br>
towards plant pathogenic fungi in the rhizosphere of plants. Moreover the treatment<br>
enhances the total phenolic contents of the plants.<br>
It is within the compass of the invention to composition useful as plant and soil health<br>
enhancer using cow urine along with neem and garlic and application thereof for<br>
promoting plant growth and controlling plant pathogenic fungi, said composition<br>
comprising any type of urine or plant having the ability to stimulate the accumulation<br>
of nutrients in the plant biomass, proliferation of plant growth promoting, phosphate<br>
solubilizing, abiotic stress tolerant and antagonists towards plant pathogenic fungi in<br>
the rhizosphere of plants, and enhances the total phenolic contents of the plants.<br>
Another aspect of the invention is directed to a method of controlling plant diseases<br>
and promoting plant growth of plants in soil both under greenhouse and field<br>
conditions which have the potential as biopesticide for the biocontrol of wide host<br>
range of economically important pathogenic fungi.<br>
The treatment can be applied directly to the seeds or plants, can be present in the soil<br>
before planting or can be distributed, e.g., by spreading, spraying or the like, over the<br>
crop or soil top or in soil furrow where the crop has been planted.<br>
Sclerotia/chlamydospores of pathogenic fungi can be treated by treatment by soaking,<br>
or other method known in the art for applying treatment to sclerotia and<br>
chlamydospores.<br>
Seeds can be treated by soaking with a composition containing the subject treatment<br>
by spraying with the liquid, or other method known in the art for applying treatment<br>
to seeds by well-known methods.<br>
According to a further aspect the invention, seed-borne diseases can be prevented by<br>
soaking the seeds with treatment by spraying with the liquid, or other method known<br>
in the art for applying treatment to seeds by well-known methods.<br>
The carriers that may be used to disperse the subject treatments would include all<br>
those commonly used for inoculating crops and would include carriers such as peat,<br>
vermicompost and fermented press mud.<br>
According to this embodiment of the invention the optimum carrier may vary<br>
depending on the treatment used. Any of the above compositions, liquids, powders,<br>
oils or solid bases such as peat, soil, rice husk, vermiculite, caboxymethyl cellulose,<br>
peat, vermicompost, perlite, polyvinyl-pyrrolidone, and talc and the like may have<br>
nutrients included therein or and any other carrier agents. However, as demonstrated<br>
by the examples below, vermicompost and fermented press mud are preferred.<br>
Further aspect of this invention relates to a process whereby the synergistic<br>
composition thus produced of the present invention may be used in any manner<br>
known in the art for example, including pretreatment of soil or seeds or pregerminated<br>
plant roots alone or in combination with other chemicals which is harmless to the<br>
growth and survival of bacteria for example plant growth promoting compounds,<br>
pesticides, fertilizers, peat, vermicompost, and fermented press mud.<br>
The invention is further elaborated with the help of examples. However, the examples<br>
should not be construed to limit the scope of the invention.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Collection and fermentation of cow urine11<br>
Fresh urine from healthy indigenous (Sahiwal) cows was collected from Gajaria farm,<br>
Department of Animal Husbandry, Government of Uttar Pradesh, Lucknow in<br>
morning into clean plastic container. One liter urine was poured into 2 liter capacity<br>
either copper or earthen pot buried in soil up to its neck. Pot was covered on top and<br>
urine was fermented at temperature of 25-35°C, for 30 days. Level of the urine in the<br>
pot was maintained by adding water as and when necessary. After 30 days, fermented<br>
product was either used directly or boiled and concentrated to 0.25 liter, before its<br>
application. In another combinations cow urine was fermented along with neem (250<br>
gm leaves/liter) and/or garlic (100 gm crushed bulbs/liter). In yet another<br>
combinations neem leaves and/or crushed garlic bulbs were fermented with water.<br>
Like wise 12 treatments using urine, neem leaves and/or crushed garlic bulbs were<br>
individually prepared in copper or earthen pot, each, to a final total of 24 treatments.<br>

greenhouse<br>
The experiment to examine the effect of 24 treatments on plant growth promotion<br>
ability of chickpea in greenhouse was carried out in four different sets of 30 chickpea<br>
seedlings each, for treated and non-treated seeds (control). Earthen pots (of 25 cm<br>
diameter) in the replicate of 4 were used, to grow chickpea. Each pot was filled up<br>
with non-sterilized soil. Tap water was added to each hole before planting seeds to<br>
adjust the dry soil to 20% moisture with the 24 treatments individually diluted to<br>
1:100. Six treated seeds were added per hole. In each set, data was noted after 21 days<br>
of plant growth with respect to plant dry weight. The results are tabulated in the<br>
following Table I . Treated plants demonstrated better plant dry weight, compared<br>
with un-treated control. Among the treated plants, boiled urine+neem fermented in<br>
earthen pot showed best results in terms of better seedling dry weight by showing<br>
106% increase, compared with un-treated control.<br>

chamydospores of Fusarium sp. under in vitro conditions<br>
The product containing urine + neem + garlic fermented in earthen vessel, obtained by<br>
the procedure outlined in Example 1 was screened lor its ability to inhibit growth of<br>
the sclerotia of Sclerotium rolfsii, Rhizoctonia solani and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and<br>
chamydospores of Fusarium sp. under in vitro conditions as follows: Three-weeks old<br>
similar sized sclerotia/chamydospores collected from NA plates were surface<br>
sterilized and dipped in the treatment individually, as indicated for up to 6 hrs. In the<br>
control set the sclerotia/chamydospores were suspended in sterile distilled water. The<br>
viability of the sclerotia/chamydospores was monitored by removing and inoculating<br>
3 batches of 15 sclerotia/chamydospores on NA after incubation at 28°C for 7 days.<br>
Viability of sclerotia/chamydospores was recorded in terms of number of germinating<br>
sclerotia/chamydospores by visual examination of mycelial growth after 7 days. After<br>
incubation for 7 days mycelial growth was readily visible in the case of treatments<br>
does not having biocontrol activity, as fungal growth around the scierotia was not<br>
inhibited and mycelia grew around the sclerotia on the plate (Table 5). On the<br>
contrary after incubation for 7 days mycelial growth was not visible in the case of<br>
treatments having biocontrol activity, as fungal growth around the sclerotia was<br>
inhibited and mycelia did not grew around the sclerotia on the plate (Table 5). Product<br>
containing urine + neem + garlic fermented in earthen vessel demonstrated that<br>
sclerotia of Sclerotium rolfsii, Rhizoctonia solani and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and<br>

EXAMPLE 8<br>
Effect of various concentrations of the product containing urine + neem + garlic<br>
fermented in earthen vessel by foliar spray treatment to control leaf spot disease<br>
of field grown betelvine caused by Alternaria alternata<br>
The product containing urine + neem + garlic fermented in earthen vessel, obtained by<br>
the procedure outlined in Example 1 was screened for its ability to control leaf spot<br>
disease of field grown betelvine caused by Alternaria alternata as follows: The field<br>
experiment for management of leaf spot disease of betelvine with the help of various<br>
concentrations of the product containing urine + neem + garlic fermented in earthen<br>
vessel was conducted in the conservatory at the National Botanical Research Institute,<br>
Lucknow, India in a randomized block design. The conservatory in which the<br>
experiments were carried out was about 5 meter high and covered on all the sides with<br>
wire nettings supported on angled iron pillars. Paddy straw was used on these nettings<br>
to provide suitable conditions of shade and moisture needed for betelvine cultivation.<br>
One-meter wide beds were prepared with a width of 35 cm and 10 cm high ridges.<br>
The setts for sowing were selected from single node cuttings from two year old vines<br>
growing in beds of 4.5 x 3 m2 area.<br>
The cuttings were planted on either side of the ridges in April 2001, on a field plot<br>
naturally infected with Alternaria alternata and covered with paddy straw and<br>
sprinkled with water 4-5 times a day for nearly one month creating suitable moisture<br>
conditions for the proper germination of vines. In each bed 15 vines of the plants were<br>
maintained for each treatment. Disease symptoms on lower leaves were visible by<br>
July, 2001. First spraying of the product was done at that time and was repeated by 5<br>
