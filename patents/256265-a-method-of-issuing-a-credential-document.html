MANAGED CREDENTIAL ISSUANCE<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Credentials   include   identification   cards, driver's licenses,  passports,  and other documents. Such   credentials   generally   include   printed information,  such  as  a  photo,  account  numbers, identification   numbers,    and   other   personal information.  Additionally,  credentials  can include data that is encoded in a smartcard chip, a magnetic stripe, or a barcode, for example. Smartcard chips can   include   a   microprocessor   for   executing applications stored in the memory of the smartcard chip. Such applications can be used to manage account information,  audit use of the credential,  perform security   checks,   and   perform   other   tasks. Accordingly,  the production  and issuance of  such credentials often requires the integration of several credential  production  applications  and  credential production  devices,  such  as  a  printer  and  data encoder.<br>
As a result, the management of the production of a credential can be very complicated. This complexity is increased as a result of a need to make the process highly secure.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention generally relates to a<br>
method of issuing a credential.  In the method,  a<br>
request for issuance of the credential is received.<br>
Next,  a  unique  identification  for  the  requested<br><br>
credential is assigned and data elements corresponding to the credential are provided. A credential production data collection is built in accordance with a credential production template. The credential production data collection includes the unique identification and production job data. Production commands are then provided to a credential production device based on the credential production data collection and the credential is produced using the credential production device in response to the production commands.<br>
Other features and benefits that characterize embodiments of the present invention will be apparent upon reading the following detailed description and review of the associated drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION-OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
FIG. 1 is a flowchart illustrating a method of issuing a credential document in accordance with embodiments of the invention.<br>
FIG. 2 is a block diagram of a credential issuance system in accordance with embodiments of the invention. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present invention generally relates to credential issuance and will be described with reference to FIGS. 1 and 2. FIG. 1 is a flowchart illustrating a method of issuing a credential in accordance with embodiments of the invention. FIG. 2 is a block diagram of a credential issuance system in accordance with embodiments of the invention.<br><br>
The credential issuance system 100 generally includes a credential issuance engine 102, one or more credential production applications 104, and one or more credential production devices 106. The credential issuance system 100 is generally remotely located from a credential management system 10 8 and operates independently from the credential management system. The credential management system 108 generally performs customer services for handling service requests regarding credentials including receiving orders for new credentials or replacement credentials from customers.<br>
In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, communications between the credential issuance engine 102 and other components of the system 100 are performed in a secure manner. A security manager 110 can be used to ' facilitate the secure communications. The secure communication protocol that is used can vary depending on the desired level of security. In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, one or more security checks are made to verify that the parties of the communication (device, system or individual) are authorized parties. Such security checks can include, for example, password checks (e.g., Public Key Infrastructure or PKI, challenge-response protocol, etc.), biometric data checks, and other types of security checks. In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, the security manager 110  includes  a hardware  security<br><br>
module for securely storing encrypted keys that are used in accordance with the secure communication protocol. Additionally, the data sent during such communications can be encrypted in accordance with conventional methods to prevent misappropriation of the data.<br>
At step 112 of the method, the credential issuance engine 102 receives a request 114 for issuance of a credential. Preferably, the request 114 and other related communications are made in a secure manner, as described above. In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, the request is communicated over a network 116 from the credential management system 108.<br>
In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, a check is made to determine whether the issuance and/or production of the credential is authorized. Such an authorization check is not required in prior art systems that issue credentials locally. Authorization can be verified through a security check to determine whether the credential management system (or an operator of the system) 108 is a recognized authority for which the credential issuance system 100 is authorized to issue credentials and/or receive credential issuance requests. In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, the security check is handled by the security manager 110 and includes a password check, a biometric data check, or other suitable security check.<br><br>
At step 118, a unique identification 12 0 is assigned to the requested credential- The unique identification can' be provided along with the request 114 from the credential management system 108 (as shown), generated by the credential issuance engine 102, or retrieved from a database, such as database 122. The unique identification can be used to manage the issuance process. Additionally, the unique identification can be used as a reference by an auditor 124 that maintains an account of the issuance process.<br>
At step 126, data elements 128 corresponding to the requested credential are provided to the credential issuance engine 102. In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, the data elements 12 8 are in an Extensible Markup Language (XML) format. The data elements 128 can be received by the credential issuance engine 102 in the form of a record 130 along with the request 114 from the credential management system 108 (as shown) , obtained from the database 122, and/or retrieved from another location. Additionally, batch files containing multiple records- and requests for credential issuance can be provided to the credential issuance engine 102 from a records database 131. Preferably, the data elements are provided in a secure manner, as described above.<br>
The data elements 128 generally include data to be used to form the requested credential such as image data corresponding to an image to be printed to the credential and encoding data to be encoded to the<br><br>
credential (i.e., written to a smartcard chip, a magnetic stripe, a barcode, etc.). Additionally, the data elements can include application data for use by one or more credential production applications 104, such as first credential production application 132 and second credential production application 134. The credential production applications 104 are generally configured to process the application data and produce production job data used to control one or more credential process devices 136 of the credential production device that produce the requested. credential. For example, a smartcard chip encoding production application can process the data elements into instructions for a data encoder 13 8 to encode data to the credential or a printing device 140 for printing an image to the credential.<br>
The data elements 128 can be tied to the unique identification 120. For instance, the unique identification 120 can be used to identify the intended credential holder through a look-up table or other method. Accordingly, data elements corresponding to personal information of the credential holder and features that are to be included in the credential can then be obtained using the unique identification from, for example, the database 122.<br>
At step 142 of the method, a credential production data collection 144 is built by the credential issuance engine 102 in accordance with a credential production template 146. The credential production template 146<br><br>
can be received from the credential management system 108 - In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, the requested credential is associated with the credential production template 146. For example, a template identification 147 in the request 114 can identify the template 146 to be used for the requested credential and the credential issuance engine 102 can access the identified template 146 in the database 122, or other location. Alternatively, the credential issuance engine 102 can select a template 146 based on the type of credential being issued, the credential management system 108 making the request, or other basis.<br>
One embodiment of the credential production template 146 defines features of the requested credential. For example, the credential production template 146 can include one or more production job data fields such as first and second production job data fields 148 and 150, each of which correspond to a different feature of the requested credential (i.e., data encoding, printing, etc.). An application data field 151 defines the application data (i.e., smartcard application data) to be written to the credential. Additionally, the credential production template 146 can define a format for the data fields.<br>
The credential issuance engine 102 provides select data elements 12 8 to the credential production applications 104 as required to complete the fields of the credential production template 14 6 and form the<br><br>
credential production data collection 144. For example, image-related data elements 128 can be processed by the first credential production application 132 to produce first credential production job data 152 relating to instructions to the credential production device 106 to print an image to the credential substrate. Similarly, data elements 128 corresponding to data to be encoded to the credential can be provided to the second credential production application 134 to produce second credential production job data 154 relating to instructions to the credential production device to encode data to the credential.<br>
Additionally, the credential issuance engine can move select data elements that do not require processing to complete fields of the credential production template, such as application data 164, to be written to a smart card chip of the credential. One embodiment of the credential production template includes location identifiers (i.e., pointers) of the data elements that are required to produce the credential. These can be the same as the data elements 128 discussed above, or relate to different data.<br>
Another embodiment of the credential production template 146 includes security information 160 such as a level of security required to issue or produce the credential, authorities required to issue or produce the credential, and encryption that is required of the data, for example. The credential production template 146 can also include audit information 162 defining the<br><br>
auditing  to be performed  during the  issuance  or production of the credential.<br>
The credential production data collection 144 is complete when all of the fields of the credential production template 146, or at least those designated as being required, have been filled. Thus, embodiments of the credential production data collection 144 include the unique identification 120 for the requested credential, application data 164 corresponding to one or more applications to be written to a smartcard chip of the credential, and credential production job data, such as 152 and 154, corresponding to one or more processes (i.e., printing of an image, encoding of data, laminating, etc.) to be performed on a credential substrate 166 (e.g., card substrate for identification cards, page substrates of a passport, a hologram overlaminate, etc.) to form the credential 168.<br>
In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, the credential production data collection 144 is written in Extensible Markup Language (XML) format. Thus, each data element of the collection 144 is preferably encapsulated by tags' that identify the encapsulated data. Thus, for example, the credential production data collection 144 can include a data string in the form of *<uid> unique identification first production job datasecond production job dataimage data
 <br>
(the text within the brackets) identify and encapsulate the data therebetween. For example, the tags "<utd>" and n</utd></uid>" encapsulate the unique identification data.<br>
At step 170, production commands are provided to the credential production device 106 by the credential issuance engine 102 based on the credential production data collection. The credential production device includes one or more controllers 172 that respond to the commands by processing the credential substrate 166 to produce the credential 168, at step 174.<br>
The production commands are preferably communicated to a controller of the credential production device in accordance with a secure communication protocol, as described above. In. accordance with one embodiment of the invention, the credential issuance engine 102 verifies that the credential production device 106 is authorized to produce the credential prior to providing the production commands. For example, the security manager 110 can perform a security check of the credential production device 106 including a security check to determine whether components of the device 106 are authorized production components.<br>
The production commands are preferably formatted in accordance with a device definition for the credential production device 106 or definitions for the process devices 136 of the credential production device 106. The definitions can be included in the credential<br><br>
production template 146, retrieved from the database 122, or provided to the credential issuance engine 102 from the credential production device 106.<br>
The credential issuance engine 102 sequences the commands in accordance with the definition(s) and selectively feeds the commands to the credential production device 106 to process the credential substrate 166 and form the credential 168 in accordance with the request 114. For instance, the commands can include commands for controlling the feeding of the credential substrate 166 through the credential production device 106, commands for printing an image to the credential substrate 166 by a printing device 140 and commands for encoding data to the credential substrate 166 by a data encoding device 138.<br>
In accordance with one embodiment of the ■ invention, the credential issuance engine 102 includes an XML parser that directs each data portion of the credential production data collection to the appropriate processing device 13 6 of the credential production device 106 based on the XML tags. For example, when the credential issuance engine 102 receives the exemplary XML credential production data collection provided above, the credential . issuance engine 102 identifies the first credential production job data by the tag <first job> and - provides the corresponding commands to the process device 136 configured   to   perform   the   corresponding   job.<br><br>
Alternatively, the controller 172 can include the XML parser.<br>
In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, the selective feeding of the commands is performed in response to a communication from the credential production device 106 or the individual processing devices. 136. Thus, the credential issuance engine 102 monitors the processing steps that produce the credential 168. The credential issuance engine 102 preferably receives a communication from the credential production device 106 indicating that a process step has been completed before sending commands for performing the next process step. For example, production commands to print an image to the credential substrate 166 may follow a communication from the credential production device 106 indicating that the -credential substrate 166 is in position to begin ■ printing. The credential issuance engine 102 then monitors the printing of the image and sends the commands for the next processing steps (e.g., substrate feeding, data encoding, etc.) to the credential production device 106 once the printing is complete. This process continues until the production of the credential 168 is complete. In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, the communication from the credential production device 106 notifying the credential issuance engine 102 of a completed process step includes the unique identification 120.<br><br>
The auditor 124 of the credential issuance system 100 can maintain an audit trail 180 for the issuance of the credential. As mentioned above, the auditor 124 uses the unique identification 114 as a reference. In general, the audit trail 180 includes a status 182 of the processing of the credential.<br>
The audit trail 180 can also include information on completed processing steps 184, such as, for example, time and date information regarding completed processing steps, information about the credential production device 106 or process device 13 6 that performed the process step, an identification of an operator of the credential production device 106 that performed the process step, and other information. The ■ audit trail 18 0 can also include a list of processing steps yet to be completed 186 before production of the credential is complete. Information regarding the processing steps to be completed can be obtained from the credential production template 144.<br>
The auditor 124 can also be configured .to identify unusual credential production activity that may indicate a security problem, or a problem with the credential production device that may indicate that servicing of the device is required.<br>
When the production of the credential 168 is complete, the credential issuance engine 102 notifies the auditor 124, which updates the process status' 182 of the audit trail 180 for the credential. Preferably communications  between  the  auditor  124  and  the<br><br>
credential issuance engine 102 are performed in a secure manner, as describe above.<br>
Following the production of the credential 168, the credential 168 can be issued to the intended credential holder. Activation of the credential 168 may be required, which can be performed by the credential management system 108.<br>
Although the present invention has been described with reference to preferred embodiments, workers skilled in the art will recognize that changes may be made in form and detail without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
