				<td>This invention relates to a process for the preparation of 4ß-1"-[2-(substitutedl0benzoyl)anilino]-4-desoxypodophyllotoxin useful as anticancer agents. The said 4ß-1"-[2-(substituted benzoyl)anilino]-4-desoxypodophyllotoxin of formula (IV) of drawing accompanying this specification wherein R&amp;R1=H,F CI, Br, I, alkyl, alkoxy, nitro, group R.2=H or alkyl group.<br>
Etoposide and teniposide the semisynthetic derivatives of podophyllotoxin are being used as anticancer agents in the treatment of leukemia, testicular cancer and small cell lung cancer. These compounds exhibit their antitumour activity by inhibiting nuclear enzyme DNA topoisomerase-II. These podophyllum lignans block the catalytic activity of topoisomerase-II by stabilising a cleavable enzyme-DNA complex in which the DNA is cleaved and covalently linked to the enzyme. (MacDonald, T.L. ,Lewhnert, E.K., Loper, J.T., Chow, K.C., Ross, W.E.' On Mechanism of DNA Topoismerase-II with Chemotherapeutic Agents; In DNA Topoisomerases in Cancer, Potmesil, M., Kohn, K.W., Eds.; Oxford University Press, New York, 1991; pp 199-214). However, the clinical efficacy of etoposde is hindered by several limitations such as poor water solubility, development of drug resistance and metabolic inactivation.<br>
Therefore, the objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of new podophyllotoxin useful as anticancer agents. The compounds of present invention has a difference with N-linked congeners by the replacement of C-4 sugar moiety of etoposide.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of 40-l"-[2-(substituted benzoyl)anilino]-4-desoxypodophyllotoxin, of formula (IV) of drawing accompanying this specification wherein R and R1=H,F Cl, Br, I, alkyl, alkoxy, nitro, group R2=H or alkyl group, which comprises: reacting bromo podophyllotoxin derivative of formula II wherein R2=H or CH3 with amino benzophenone or its derivative of formula III wherein R and R1=H, halogens, nitro, alkyl, alkoxy in presence of a known base and a catalyst in aprotic solvent at a temperature in the range of 20 to 60°C for a period in the range of 3 to 8 hrs, removing solvent and purifying the residue by conventional column chromatography to afford the podophyllotoxin of general formula (IV) wherein R and R1=halogen, nitro, alkyl, alkoxy, and R2=H or alkyl group.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention bromopodophyllotoxin derivative used may be such as 4ß-bromo-4-desoxypodohyllotoxin, 4'-O-demethyl-4ß-bromo-4-desoxypodophyllotoxin. In another embodiment of the invention the base used may be such as triethyl amine (Et3N), pyridine.<br>
In still another embodiment of the invention the catalyst used may be such as tetrabutyl ammonium iodide (Bu4N+I"), tetrabutyl ammonium bromide (BiulSTlBr").<br>
In yet still another embodiment of the invention aprotic solvent used may be such as dichloromethane, tetrahydrofuran, ether, toluene.<br>
The compounds of present invention are illustrated as 4ß-l"-[2-(substituted benzoyl)anilino]4-desoxypodophyllotoxin (IV) and 4'-O-demethyl-4ß-l"-[2-(substituted benzoyl) anilino]-4-desoxypodophyllotoxin (IV). The process for synthesis of new congeners of formulae (IV) comprises of following steps.<br>
1)	Synthesis of 4ß- bromo-4-desoxypodophyllotoxin (II) by known modified method (Kuhn, M.; Keller-juslen, C; Von wartburg, A. Helv. Chem. Acta. 1969, 52, 948).<br>
2)	Synthesis of 4-O-demethyl -4ß-bromo 4 -desoxypodophyllotoxin (II).<br>
3)	4ß-bromo-4-desoxypodophyllotoxin (II) and 4'-O-demethyl-4ß-bromo-4-desoxypodo-phyllotoxin (II) have been coupled to amino benzophenones (III) having various substituents wherein, R may be alkyl, alkyloxy, halogens (F,CI,Br,I), nitro. R1 may be alkyl, alkyloxy, halogens (F,Br,I) nitro.<br>
4)	Using variety of solvents for the nucleophilic displacement of bromine such as dichloromethane, tetrahydrofuran, toluene etc.<br>
5)	Using catalytic amount of tetrabutyl ammonium iodide, tetrabutyl ammonium bromide.<br>
6)	Stirring the reaction mixture between 20 to 60°C for 3 to 8h.<br>
7)	Purification of (IV) by column chromatography. These new analogues of podophyllotoxins by replacement of C-4 sugar moiety of the etoposide with N-linked congeners have shown promising antitumour activity n various cell lines particularly in small cell lung, colon, CNS, ovarian, renal and breast cancers and leukemia. It is anticipated that these compounds may have better water solubility and improved drug resistance profile. The following examples are given by way of illustration and should not be construed to limit the scope of the invention.<br>

After the completion of reaction the solvent was removed and the solution of acetone: water (1:1) and BaCO3 (eq) added to it and stirred at 40°C till the reaction was complete to obtain crude 4'-O-demethylepipodophyllotoxin. This was purified by column chromatography (chloroform : methanol, 9.8: 0.2 ml silicagel) to obtain pure product.<br>
4'-O-Demethylepipodophyllotoxin (l.lg) as obtained above was, taken in 11ml of 1,2-dichloromethane, 1ml of ether was taken and molecular sieves powder 4A0 added to this solution and kept at 0°C and then 2.75 g of HBr gas passed for 45 minutes at 0°C.
