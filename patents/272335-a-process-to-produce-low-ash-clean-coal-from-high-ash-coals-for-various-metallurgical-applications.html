FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a process to produce low ash clean coal from high<br>
ash coals for various metallurgical applications.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Concept of chemical beneficiation comes from the limitation of physical<br>
beneficiation processes. Broadly, chemical beneficiation is possible by<br>
chemical leaching of mineral matter present in coal or, dissolving organic<br>
matter of coal in various organic solvents. As coal is heterogeneous<br>
mixture of organic and inorganic constituents, solvolysis of coal varies<br>
with its constituents, maturity, and structural characteristics. Main<br>
advantage of this process are i) ease of recovery of solvent in the main<br>
process stream, ii) solvolytic efficiency of recovered solvents as that of<br>
fresh solvent, iii) 95-98% recovery of the solvent, iv) improved coking<br>
properties of clean coal, and v) availability of industrial organic solvents.<br>
However, the operating cost of this process is high because of high cost of<br>
solvents and energy requirement in the process. There is an attempt to<br>
make this process techno-economic through improving the yield to 70-<br>
80%. However, further research may be required to make the process<br>
economically viable through reducing the cost of solvent recovery.<br>
 <br>
Recovery of clean coal and its ash content depend on various operating<br>
parameters and feed characteristics like faster and convenient filtration of<br>
refluxed solution at different size, solvent and co-solvent of choice, coal<br>
source, particle size, coal-solvent ratio, extraction time, extraction<br>
temperature, etc. This may thus offer the room for the trade off between<br>
the yield and the ash contents desired in the clean coal obtained by this<br>
process.<br>
Since the mineral matter (non-combustible) in Indian coals (Gondwana<br>
coals) is very finely disseminated in the organic mass, it is extremely<br>
difficult to remove this by conventional physical coal washing techniques.<br>
High percentage of near gravity material in coal makes the scope of<br>
gravity process limited. This indicates that chemical treatment may be the<br>
right approach to overcome the limitation of physical beneficiation<br>
methods. A lot of literature is available on chemical beneficiation<br>
techniques that employ highly corrosive chemicals (mostly acids and<br>
alkalis). Recovery or regeneration of these chemicals is very important to<br>
make this technology viable. A parallel approach towards lowering ash<br>
could be recovering the premium organic matter from coal by solvent<br>
refining. Literature reveals that most of the research work on this subject<br>
was carried out with an objective to produce ultra clean coal or super<br>
clean coal with ash content less than 0.2% for various high tech end uses.<br>
This conventional solvent refining process does not serve the objective of<br>
low ash coal requirement of steel industries because of mainly low<br>
recovery which makes the process uneconomic especially when such an<br>
ultra coal is not absolutely desired at the cost of restricting to low yields.<br>
 <br>
Organo-refining or, solvent-refining, or, solvent extraction of coal is a<br>
well-established technology. Abundant literature is available on the<br>
subject. However, the primary objective in most of those cases is to<br>
provide a process to produce ultra clean coal or super clean coal with ash<br>
contains less than 0.2%. The same process has been tried in our<br>
laboratory to produce suitable coal for coke making from medium coking<br>
coal. -0.5 mm fine clean coal from flotation process has been used as<br>
parent coal for organo-refining process. The ash content of this parent<br>
coal (flotation product) is 12%. Exploratory study revealed that it is<br>
possible to extract only 30% of parent coal through this process of<br>
extraction of coal under reflux conditions at atmospheric pressure. The<br>
coal so expected contains 1% ash. Losing 70% of the parent coal (with<br>
having only 12% ash) as rejects is not acceptable.<br>
The solvent extraction of coal process involves mainly the mass transfer<br>
operations. This involves the diffusion of solvents in the solid coal matrix<br>
which results in the swelling of coal. Then as the extraction proceeds,<br>
desorption of solvent containing the extracted molecules from the swollen<br>
coal matrix results in the extraction of coal molecules. It has been<br>
observed that there is a synergistic extraction enhancement of coal by<br>
using a suitable co-solvent which may aid the swelling of coal matrix for<br>
the enhanced extraction. Solvent extraction proceeds with the shrinking of<br>
cores of the coal particles as the extraction progresses. This shrinking<br>
cores result in the demineralization of coal particles. This may thus afford<br>
the chemical designing of the process of the solvent extraction of coal in<br>
such a way that the ash reduction in coal particles may be tailored to<br>
 <br>
different ash levels. Since the solvent extraction leaches or cuts down the<br>
coal particles to different ash levels, therefore a suitable selection of the<br>
separation aid may help in obtaining the extracts of the coal macerals i.e.,<br>
super clean coal having ash contents of different cuts or extent. Therefore<br>
there is a need to find out a convenient co-solvent for the N-methyl-2-<br>
pyrrolidone (NMP) to obtain a designer solvent. There is also a need to<br>
find out the filter of a specific pore size i.e., mesh size to obtain a coal<br>
extract having ash contents in the suitable range for coke making.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an object of the invention to propose a process to produce<br>
low ash clean coal from high ash coal.<br>
Another object of the invention is to propose an economic and<br>
environment-friendly solvent-co solvent combination which is for suitable<br>
industrial extraction of coal.<br>
A further object of the invention is to propose a corresponding device to<br>
carry-out the innovative process.<br>
A still further object of the invention is to propose a process to produce<br>
low ash clean coal from high ash coals which ensures high recovery with<br>
low ash content.<br>
 <br>
A still another object of the invention is to propose a process to produce<br>
low ash clean coal from high ash coals which provides faster filtration.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWING<br>
Figure 1 - Schematically shows a device for bench scale operation of the<br>
process according to the invention.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly there is provided in one aspect of the invention a process to<br>
produce low ash clean coal from high ash coals for various metallurgical<br>
applications. According to the innovative process, coal, solvent and co-<br>
solvent are mixed thoroughly to produce a coal slurry. The coal slurry is<br>
extracted in a known manner which includes coal-solvent mixture. The<br>
mixture is separated in a separation unit to produce a coarser fraction and<br>
a finer fraction. The finer fraction is fed to a distillation unit to allow<br>
extraction of 80 to 85% of solvent recovery. The concentrated coal-<br>
solvent mixture is then flushed in a precipitation tank to precipitate the<br>
coal. Thus precipitated coal is separated in a rorary drum filter. The<br>
obtained clean coal contains less than 4% ash. The filtrate comprises a<br>
solution of solvent and water from which the solvent is recovered in a<br>
second distillation unit. The by-product from the second distillation unit<br>
being steam which can be used as a heat source in the extractor.<br>
 <br>
According to a second aspect of the invention, there is provided a device for<br>
carrying-out the innovative process. The device essentially comprises an<br>
extractor to receive coal slurry from a coal-solvent feed tank and for extraction<br>
of the same. A first rotary drum filter is connected to the extractor which on<br>
receiving the extracted coal-solvent mixture, cut the mixture into two fractions.<br>
The finer fraction is fed from the first rotary drum filter to a first distillation<br>
unit for solvent recovery. A precipitation tank is flowably connected to the first<br>
distillation unit. The precipitated coal is then separated in a second rotary<br>
drum filter. The solvent is recovered through a second distillation unit, wherein<br>
the bi-product in the second distillation unit which is steam is used as a heat<br>
source for the extractor.<br>
 <br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
A suitable solvent-co-solvent combination has been identified for<br>
convenient, environmental friendly and economical industrial extraction<br>
operation. N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) with a small amount of<br>
Cyclohexylamine (CHA) is found as the best suitable solvent for the<br>
present. The ratio of NMP and CHA may vary from 14:1 to 24:1 and the<br>
coal (g) to solvents (ml) ratio may vary from 1:15 to 1:25.<br>
A study of the behaviour of the conventional treatment for medium coking<br>
coal from West Bokaro, a clean coal (ash content 
has been produced with an objective to obtain maximum possible high<br>
 <br>
yield and to have faster and quick filtration. With this objective, the<br>
particle size of feed and both the products (clean coal and residual coal)<br>
have been studied. From the size analysis of feed and the two products, it<br>
is revealed that the process changes the size analysis of feed and the two<br>
products, it is revealed that the process changes the size distribution of<br>
coal i.e., this follows a shrinking core model. Therefore, the coal sample is<br>
refluxed with NMP and a small amount of CHA for 2 h at atmospheric<br>
pressure. Then the refluxed mixture using 500 stainless steel BSS mesh<br>
(0.025 mm) cloth is filtered. This arrangement allowed coarser and faster<br>
filtration at 0.025 mm size in comparison to that observed by using<br>
Whatman filter paper. Therefore, increase in yield of clean coal and<br>
simultaneously increase in ash content of clean coal, have been clearly<br>
established. However, this arrangement is found to be advantageous to<br>
produce high yield clean coal with low ash content (
faster filtration process. For NMP with small amount of CHA test, the<br>
results obtained are shown in the Table 1.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
A mass balancing of the ash content, reveals as under:<br>
(28.6)*(1.0)+(62.6-28.6)*(x)=(62.6)*(3.2)	(1)<br>
Where x is the ash content of extra yield.<br>
From equation (1) it is found that x=5.05. However, it can be seen from<br>
Table 2 that ash content of -0.025 mm fraction of feed sample is 14.05%.<br>
So, it is very clear that this improvement in result is not because of simply<br>
coarser cut; rather it is because of partial dissolution phenomena during<br>
the process. Comparison of the extraction yields obtained by using NMP<br>
alone (32%) with that obtained by using a convenient co-solvent i.e., CHA<br>
(62.6%) showed the synergism of using CHA as a co-solvent. This<br>
invention thus enables producing low ash (
making purpose with very high yield through a relatively faster filtration.<br>
The extraction yields on dry mineral matter basis will be still higher.<br>
 <br>
A device has been developed for bench scale operation which is shown in<br>
Fig. 1. The device consists of six units namely, (i) an Extractor (1), (ii) a<br>
first Rotary drum filter (2) (separation size 500 mesh), (iii) a first<br>
Distillation column (3), (iv) a Precipitation tank (4), (v) a second Rotary<br>
drum filter (5) (for complete solid-liquid separation, and (vi) a second<br>
Distillation column (6).<br>
Coal, solvent and co-solvent are mixed thoroughly in coal -solvent feed<br>
tank. Coal slurry is then pumped into the extractor (1). A temperature<br>
around 170°C is achieved in the extractor (1) slowly. Residence time in<br>
the extractor (1) may vary form 15 mins to 2 h and i.e. dictated by the<br>
techno economics of the process and its specific requirement. Extracted<br>
coal-solvent mixture is then separated through a first rotary drum filter (2)<br>
or any separation unit which may cut the mixture in two fractions: coarser<br>
fraction (+0.025 mm) and finer fraction (-0.025 mm). Coarser fraction<br>
contains high ash and is called as residue. The finer fraction or filtered<br>
extract is then fed to a first distillation unit (3). Maximum 80-85% solvent<br>
recovery may be allowed through the first distillation unit (3). The<br>
concentrated coal-solvent mixture is flushed in a precipitation tank (4). As<br>
NMP-CHA solvents are soluble in water, extracted coal gets separated<br>
from the solution phase and gets precipitated. This precipitated coal is<br>
separated through a second rotary drum filter (5). Thus obtained clean<br>
coal contains less than 4% ash. The filtrate consists of solvent-water<br>
solution and solvent is recovered through a second distillation unit (6).<br>
The secondary product of the second distillation unit (6) is steam, which<br>
may be used as a heat source in the extractor (1) at a high pressure. It is<br>
 <br>
possible to recover around 98% of solvent through the distillation units<br>
(3,6).<br>
The important safety measures comprises:<br>
a.	As the solvent of use are organic and are flammable in nature, it may catch<br>
fire in contact with oxygen at high temperature. Therefore, there is provision for<br>
Nitrogen flashing in the extractor (1) and the first Rotary drum filter unit (2).<br>
b.	There may be a need to guard moisture for the co-solvent i.e. CHA.-<br>
The main advantages of the invention achieved<br>
i. Recovery increases by two folds. High recovery improves the techno-<br>
economics remarkably.<br>
ii. The shrinking core based extraction affords a trade off between extraction<br>
yield and ash contents in the super clean coal obtained.<br>
iii. An environment friendly, economic and convenient solvent-co solvent mix<br>
was identified as suitable solvents. These solvents are industrial solvents and<br>
easy to handle. Therefore, there is no concern from industrial application point<br>
of view.<br>
 <br>
iv. CHA is a cheaper solvent as that of Ethylenediamine (EDA). It<br>
helps in improving the process economy,<br>
v. CHA has lesser atomic N/C ratio than that of EDA, which is good<br>
from coke making point of view as less N-contents helps in coke<br>
making,<br>
vi. Filtration becomes relatively faster by using 500 BSS mesh filter<br>
cloth, thus saving a lot of operation time,<br>
vii. Depending upon the ash contents in the super clean coal<br>
obtained, this may be studied for its other non-fuel uses as<br>
well,<br>
viii. The process is also applicable to non-coking coal for producing<br>
low ash clean coal for blast furnace injection, power generation<br>
and converting coals into liquid fuels/chemicals,<br>
ix. Maximum extraction rate is observed at the beginning of the<br>
process. Rate of extraction decreases with time. 59.6%, 63.1%<br>
extraction yield has been obtained for extraction time 0.25 h,<br>
0.75h and 1.25 h respectively,<br>
x. Extraction yield improves for fine size; e.g. it is possible to<br>
recover 76% of parent coal if -0.25 mm fraction of coal is taken<br>
for treatment,<br>
xi. The process is useful to lower the ash contents from run of<br>
mine (ROM), middlings, and clean coal from physical<br>
beneficiation processes. Table 3 shows the effect of solvent-<br>
refining treatment of these three coals.<br>
 <br>
Table 3. Test results of solvent-refining for ROM, middlings and clean<br>
coal<br>
 <br>
xii. The process can also be useful to produce super clean coal or<br>
ultra low ash clean coal (ash contents
potential end uses in obtaining graphite, aromatic polymers,<br>
specially chemicals, carbon materials such as carbon nanotubes<br>
etc.<br>
xiii. 98% of the solvent is easily recovered. This recovered solvent is<br>
as good as that of fresh solvent in terms of solvolytic efficiency.<br>
xiv. The super clan coal obtained showed good coking prosperities.<br>
Vitrinite contents increases significantly (Table 4).<br>
