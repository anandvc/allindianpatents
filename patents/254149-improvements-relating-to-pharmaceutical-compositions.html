IMPROVEMENTS RELATING TO PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates improvements relating to pharmaceutical compositions. In particular it relates to pharmaceutically active compositions and precursors therefor which contain a so-called "statin"<br>
10<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Statins are believed to reduce-serum-LDL cholesterol levels 15  by inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoenzymeA<br>
reductatse (HMG-CoA Reductase).. "Several statins are known, including Atorvastatin, Cerivastatin, Fluvastatin, Lovastatin, Mevastatin, Pitavastatin, Pravavastatin, Rosuvastatin and Simvastatin.<br>
20  <br>
      statins have been proposed for use in th etratment of<br>
      coronary heart disease, myocatdial infatction, stroke and<br>
      peripheral artery disease and the statins appear to have<br>
      favorable effect in the treatment of inflammation,  dementia,<br>
25.	neoplastic conditions, nuclear catatacts and pulmonatry <br>
hypertension.	<br>
   Many statins exhibit low water solubility and are <br>
   practically insoluble in water. This hinders their effective <br>
   use. <br>

Our co-pending international patent application PCT/GB03/03226 describes the formation of solid, porous beads comprising a three dimensional open-cell lattice of a water-soluble polymeric material.  These are typically 5  'templated' materials formed by the removal of both water<br>
and a non-aqueous dispersed phase from a high internal phase emulsion (HIPE) which has a polymer dissolved in the aqueous phase. The beads are formed by dropping the HIPE emulsion into a low temperature fluid such as liquid nitrogen, then<br>
10  freeze-drying the particles formed to remove the bulk of the aqueous phase and the dispersed phase.  This leaves behind the polymer in the form of a 'skeletal' structure.  The beads dissolve rapidly in water and have the remarkable   property that a water-insoluble component dispersed in the<br>
15  dispersed phase of the emulsion prior to freezing and drying   can also be dispersed in water on solution of the polymer skeleton of the beads.<br>
WO 2005/011636 discloses a non-emulsion based spray drying 20  process for forming 'solid amorphous dispersions' of drugs in polymers. In this method a polymer and a low-solubility drug are dissolved in a solvent and spray-dried to form dispersions in which the drug is mostly present in an amorphous form rather than in a crystalline form. 25<br>
Our co-pending applications GB 0501835 and GB 0613925 (filed 13th July 2006) describe how materials which will form a nanc-dispersion in water can be prepared, preferably by a spray-drying process. In the first of these applications the 30  water insoluble materials is dissolved in the solvent-phase<br><br>
WO 2008/006715<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/056563<br><br>
-   3   -<br>
of an emulsion.  In the second, the water-insoluble materials are dissolved in a mixed solvent system and co-exist in the same phase as a water-soluble structuring agent. In both cases the liquid is dried above ambient 5  temperature (above 20 Celsius), such as by spray drying, to produce particles of the structuring agent, as a carrier, with the water-insoluble materials dispersed therein. When these particles are placed in water they dissolve, forming a nano-dispersion of the water-insoluble material with 10  particles typically below 300nm. This scale is similar to that of virus particles, and the water-insoluble material behaves as though it were in solution.<br>
WO 2003/103640 (Elan.-Pharma International Ltd) discloses 15  nanoparticulate forms of statins (particularly Lovastatin or Simvastatin). Particle sizes are disclosed from 2000nm down to 50nm.  Methods for the production of these nanoparticles include grinding, milling, homogenisation, and precipitation methods. 20<br>
In the present application the term 'ambient temperature' means 20 degrees Celsius and all percentages are percentages by weight unless otherwise specified.<br>
25  Brief Description of the Invention<br>
We have now determined that both the emulsion-based and the single-phase method can be used to produce a water-soluble, nano-disperse form of a statin. 30<br><br>
WO 2008/006715<br><br>
PCT7EP2007/056563<br><br>

Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the production of a composition comprising a water-insoluble statin which comprises the steps of:<br>
5  a)   providing a mixture comprising:<br>
i)   a water-insoluble statin<br>
ii)  a water soluble carrier, 10<br>
iii) a solvent for each of the statin and the carrier ,<br>
and<br>
15  b)   spray-drying the mixture to remove the or each solvent and obtain a substantially solvent-free nano-dispersion of the statin in the carrier.<br>
The preferred method of particle sizing for the dispersed 20  products of the present invention employs a dynamic light scattering instrument (Nano S, manufactured by Malvern Instruments UK). Specifically, the Malvern Instruments Nano S uses a red (633nm) 4mW Helium-Neon laser to illuminate a standard optical quality UV curvette containing a suspension 25  of material. The particle sizes quoted in this application are those obtained with that apparatus using the standard protocol.  Particle sizes in solid products are the particle sizes inferred from the measurement of the particle size obtained by solution of the solid in water and measurement 30  of the particle size.<br><br>
WO 2008/006715<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/056563<br><br>
-   5   -<br>
Preferably, the peak: diameter of the water-insoluble statin is below 800nm.  More preferably the peak diameter of the water-insoluble statin is below 500nm.  In a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention the peak diameter of 5  the water-insoluble statin is below 200nm.<br>
It is believed that reduction of the particle size in the eventual nano-dispersion has significant advantages in improving the availability of the otherwise water-insoluble<br>
10  material.  This is believed to be particularly advantageous where an improved bio-availability is sought, or, in similar applications where high local concentrations of the material are to be avoided. Moreover it is believed that nano-dispersions with a small particle size are more stable than<br>
15  those with a larger particle size.<br>
In the context of the present invention, "water insoluble" as applied to the statin means that its solubility in water is less than 10g/L.  Preferably, the water insoluble statin<br>
20  has solubility in water at ambient temperature (20 Celsius) less than 5g/L preferably of less than lg/L, especially preferably less than 150mg/L, even more preferably less than lOOmg/L. This solubility level provides the intended interpretation of what is meant by water-insoluble in the<br>
25  present specification.<br>
Preferred water-insoluble statins include Atorvastatin, Cerivastatin, Fluvastatin, Lovastatin, Mevastatin, Pitavastatin, Pravavastatin, Rosuvastatin, Simvastatin and 30  water insoluble derivatives thereof.  For example, the range<br><br>
WO 2008/006715	PCT/EP2007/056563<br>
-   6   -<br>
of solubilities of lovastatin, mevastatin and simvastatin lie between 0.0013-0.0015 mg/ml.<br>
Preferred carrier materials are selected from the group 5  consisting of water-soluble inorganic materials, surfactants, polymers and mixtures thereof.<br>
A further aspect of the present invention provides a process for preparing a statin composition comprising a water-10  insoluble statin and a water-soluble carrier, which comprises the steps of:<br>
a)   forming an emulsion comprising:<br>
15       i)   a solution of the statin in a water-immiscible solvent for the same, and<br>
ii)  an aqueous solution of the carrier, and,<br>
20  b)   drying the emulsion to remove water and the water-immiscible solvent to obtain a substantially solvent-free nano-dispersion of the statin in the carrier For convenience, this class of method is referred to herein as the "emulsion" method.<br>
25<br>
A further aspect of the present invention provides a process for preparing a statin composition comprising a water insoluble statin and a water-soluble carrier which comprises the steps of:<br>
30<br><br>
WO 2008/006715<br><br>
PCT7EP2007/056563<br><br>
-   7   -<br>
a)	providing a single phase mixture comprising:<br>
i)   at least one non-aqueous solvent<br>
5       ii)  optionally, water<br>
iii) a water-soluble carrier material soluble in the mixture of (i) and (ii) and<br>
10       iv)  a water-insoluble statin which is soluble in the mixture of (i) and (ii), and,<br>
b)	drying the solution to remove water and the water<br>
miscible solvent to obtain a substantially solvent-free<br>
15       nano-dispersion of the statin in the carrier.<br>
For convenience, this class of method is referred to herein as the "single-phase" method.<br>
20  In the context of the present invention substantially<br>
solvent free means that the free solvent content of the product is less than 15%wt, preferably below 10%wt, more preferably below 5%wt and most preferably below 2%wt.<br>
25  In the context of the present invention it is essential that both the carrier material and the statin are essentially fully dissolved in their respective solvents prior to the drying step.  It is not within the ambit of the present specification to teach the drying of slurries.  For the<br>
30  avoidance of any doubt, it is therefore the case that the solids content of the emulsion or the mixture is such that<br><br>
WO 2008/006715<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/056563<br><br>
-   8   -<br>
over 90%wt, preferably over 95%, and more preferably over 98% of the soluble materials present is in solution prior to the drying step.<br>
5  In relation to the methods mentioned above, the preferred statin and the preferred carrier materials are as described above and as elaborated on in further detail below. Similarly the preferred physical characteristics of the material are as described above.<br>
10<br>
The 'single phase' method where both the statin and the carrier material are dissolved in a phase comprising at least one other non-aqueous solvent (and optional water) is preferred. This is believed to-be more efficacious in<br>
15  obtaining a smaller particle size for the nano-disperse<br>
statin. Preferably, the drying step simultaneously removes both the water and other solvents and, more preferably, drying is accomplished by spray drying at above ambient temperature.<br>
20  The product obtainable by the process aspects of the<br>
present invention are suitable for use in the perparation of <br>
medicaments for treatment fo prophylaxis of coronary heart<br>
disease, myocardial infarction, stroke, peripheral artery,<br>
inflammation, dementia , neoplastic conditions, nuclear<br>
25  cataracts and/or pulmonary hypertension.<br>
A further aspect of the present invention provides a method for the preparation of a medicament for use in the treatment or prophylaxis of coronary heart disease, myocardial 30  infarction, stroke, peripheral artery, inflammation,<br><br>

5<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
Various preferred features and embodiments of the present invention are described in further detail below. 10<br>
Statins:<br>
As noted above the preferred water-insoluble anti-parasitic drugs are water-insoluble anti-malarial drugs selected from<br>
15  the group consisting of Atorvastatin, Cerivastatin, Fluvastatin, Lovastatin, Mevastatin, Pitavastatin,' Pravavastatin, Rosuvastatin, Simvastatin and derivatives and mixtures thereof. These can be present as the sole pharmaceutically active ingredient in compositions according<br>
20  to the present invention or be together with other drugs to provide a so-called 'combination therapy'.  As an illustrative example. Simvastatin is also available in a combination formulation with Ezetimibe.<br>
25  Water-Dispersible Product Form:<br>
The present invention provides a method for obtaining a water-dispersible form of an otherwise water-insoluble material. This is prepared by forming a not wholly aqueous 30  intermediate emulsion or solution in which both a water-soluble carrier material and the water insoluble statin are<br><br>
WO 2008/006715<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/056563<br><br>
-   10   -<br>
dissolved. On removal of solvents the insoluble statin is left dispersed through the water-soluble carrier material. Suitable carrier materials are described in further detail below. 5<br>
The structure of the material obtained after the drying step is not well understood. It is believed that the resulting dry materials are not encapsulates, as discrete macroscopic bodies of the water-insoluble materials are not present in<br>
10  the dry product. Neither are the dry materials dry emulsions' as little or none of the volatile solvent comprising the 'oil' phase of the emulsion remains after the drying step. On addition of water to the dry product the emulsion is not reformed, as -it would be with a dry<br>
15  emulsion'. It is also believed that the compositions are not so-called solid solutions, as with the present invention the ratios of components present can be varied without loss of the benefits. Also from X-ray and DSC studies, it is believed that the compositions of the invention are not<br>
20  solid solutions, but comprise nano-scale, phase-separated mixtures.<br>
Preferably, the compositions produced after the drying step will comprise the statin and the carrier in a weight ratio 25  of from 1:500 to 1:1 (as statin:carrier), 1:100 to 1:1 being preferred. Typical levels of around 10-30%wt water-insoluble statin and 90-70%wt carrier can be obtained by spray drying.<br>
By the method of the present invention the particle size of 30  the statin materials can be reduced to below lOOnm and may<br><br>
WO 2008/006715<br><br>
PCT7EP2007/056563<br><br>
-   11   -<br>
be reduced to around 15nm. Preferred particle sizes are in the range 40-15nm.<br>
'Emulsion' Preparation Method: 5<br>
In one preferred method according to the invention the solvent for the water-insoluble statinis not miscible with water. On admixture with water it therefore can form an emulsion. 10<br>
Preferably, the non-aqueous phase comprises from about 10 % to about 95 % v/v of the emulsion, more preferably from about 20 % to about 68 % v/v.<br>
15  The emulsions are typically prepared under conditions which are well known to those skilled in the art, "for example, by using a magnetic stirring bar, a homogeniser, a sonicator or a rotational mechanical stirrer. The emulsions need not be particularly stable, provided that they do not undergo<br>
20  extensive phase separation prior to drying.<br>
Homogenisation using a high-shear mixing device is a particularly preferred way to make an emulsion in which the aqueous phase is the continuous phase. It is believed that 25  this avoidance of coarse emulsion and reduction of the<br>
droplet size of the dispersed phase of the emulsion, results in an improved dispersion of the 'payload' material in the dry product.<br>
30  In a preferred method according to the invention a water-continuous emulsion is prepared with an average dispersed-<br><br>
WO 2008/006715<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/056563<br><br>
-   12   -<br>
phase droplet size (using the Malvern peak intensity) of between 500nm and 5000nm. We have found that an 'Ultra-Turrux' T25 type laboratory homogenizer (or equivalent) gives a suitable emulsion when operated for more than a 5  minute at above 10,000 rpm.<br>
There is a directional relation between the emulsion droplet size and the size of the particles of the 'payload' material, which can be detected after dispersion of the 10  materials of the invention in aqueous solution. We have<br>
determined that an increase in the speed of homogenization for precursor emulsions can decrease final particle size after re-dissolution.<br>
15  It is believed that the re-dissolved particle size can be reduced by: nearly one half when the homogenization speed increased from 13,500 rpm to 21,500 rpm. The homogenization time is also believed to play a role in controlling re-dissolved particle size. The particle size again decreases<br>
20  with increase in the homogenization time, and the particle size distribution become broader at the same time.<br>
Sonication is also a particularly preferred way of reducing the droplet size for emulsion systems. We have found that a 25  Hert Systems Sonicator XL operated at level 10 for two minutes is suitable.<br>
It is believed that ratios of components which decrease the relative concentration of the anti-parasitic to the solvents 30  and/or the carrier give a smaller particle size.<br><br>
WO 2008/006715<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/056563<br><br>
-   13   -<br>
'Single Phase' Preparation Method:<br>
In an alternative method according to the present invention both the carrier and the statin are soluble in a non-aqueous 5  solvent or a mixture of such a solvent with water.  Both here and elsewhere in the specification the non-aqueous solvent can be a mixture of non-aqueous solvents.<br>
In this case the feedstock of the drying step can be a 10  single phase material in which both the water-soluble<br>
carrier and the water-insoluble statin are dissolved. It is also possible for this feedstock to be an emulsion, provided that both the carrier and the statin are dissolved in the same phase. 15<br>
The 'single-phase' method is. generally believed to give a better nano-dispersion with a smaller particle size than the emulsion method.<br>
20 It is believed that ratios of components which decrease the relative concentration of the statin to the solvents and/or the carrier give a smaller particle size.<br>
Drying:<br>
25<br>
Spray drying is well known to those versed in the art. In the case of the present invention some care must be taken due to the presence of a volatile non-aqueous solvent in the emulsion being dried. In order to reduce the risk of<br>
30  explosion when a flammable solvent is being used, an inert gas, for example nitrogen, can be employed as the drying<br><br>
WO 2008/006715<br><br>
PCT7EP2007/056563<br><br>
-   14   -<br>
medium in a so-called closed spray-drying system. The solvent can be recovered and re-used.<br>
We have found that the 'Buchi' B-290 type laboratory spray 5  drying apparatus is suitable.<br>
It is preferable that the drying temperature should be at or above 100 Celsius, preferably above 120 Celsius and most preferably above 140 Celsius. Elevated drying temperatures 10  have been found to give smaller particles in the re-dissolved nano-disperse material.<br>
Carrier Material:<br>
15  The carrier material is water soluble, which includes the     formation of structured aqueous phases as well as true ionic solution of molecularly mono-disperse species. The carrier material preferably comprises an inorganic material, surfactant, a polymer or may be a mixture of two or more of<br>
20  these.<br>
It is envisaged that other non-polymeric, organic, water-soluble materials such as sugars can be used as the carrier. However the carrier materials specifically mentioned herein 25  are preferred.<br>
Suitable carrier materials (referred to herein as 'water soluble carrier materials') include preferred water-soluble polymers, preferred water-soluble surfactants and preferred 30  water-soluble inorganic materials.<br><br>

In another alternative form of the invention the non-aqueous solvent is not miscible with water and forms an emulsion.<br>
The non-aqueous phase of the emulsion is preferably selected 25  from one or more from the following group of volatile organic solvents:<br>
•    alkanes, preferably heptane, n-hexane, isooctane, dodecane, decane; 30<br><br>

Preferred non-aqueous solvents, whether miscible or not have a boiling point of less than 150 Celsius and, more preferably, have a boiling point of less than 100 Celsius,<br>

Preferably, the non-aqueous solvent comprises from about 10 % to about 95 % v/v of any emulsion formed, more preferably from about 20 % to about 80 % v/v. In the single phase method the level of solvent is preferably 20-100%v/v. 5<br>
Particularly preferred solvents are alcohols, particularly ethanol and halogenated solvents, more preferably chlorine-containing solvents, most preferably solvents selected from (di- or tri- chloromethane). 10<br>
Optional Cosurfactant:<br>
In addition to the non-aqueous solvent an optional co-surfactant may be employed in the composition prior to<br>
15  the drying step. We have determined that the addition of a relatively small quantity of a volatile cosurfactant reduced the particle diameter of the material produced. This can have a significant impact on particle volume. For example, reduction from 297nm to 252nm corresponds to a particle size<br>
20  reduction of approximately 40%. Thus, the addition of a small quantity of co-surfactant offers a simple and inexpensive method for reducing the particle size of materials according to the present invention without changing the final product formulation.<br>

Preferred co-surfactants are short chain alcohols or amine with a boiling point of 
Preferred co-surfactants are linear alcohols.  Preferred 30  co-surfactants are primary alcohols and amines.<br>

It is particularly preferable that the level of the statin in the composition should be such that the loading in the dried composition is below 40%wt, and more preferably below 25  30%wt. Such compositions have the advantages of a small particle size and high effectiveness as discussed above.<br>
Water-Dispersed Form:<br>

water, the carrier dissolves and the water-insoluble statin<br><br>

The particle size of the water-insoluble materials in the dry product is preferably such that, on solution in water 5  the water-insoluble materials have a particle size of less than 1 micron as determined by the Malvern method described herein. It is believed that there is no significant reduction of particle size for the statin on dispersion of the solid form in water.<br>
