TECHNIQUES AND SYSTEMS FOR SUPPORTING PODCASTING<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to podcasts and, more particularly, to<br>
acquiring and playing podcasts on a portable media device.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
[0002] A media player stores media assets, such as audio tracks, that can<br>
be played or displayed on the media player. One example of a portable<br>
media player is the iPod® media player, which is available from Apple<br>
Computer, Inc. of Cupertino, CA. Often, a media player acquires its media<br>
assets from a host computer that serves to enable a user to manage media<br>
assets. In managing media assets, a user can create playlists for audio<br>
tracks. These playlists can be created at the host computer. Media assets<br>
within the playlists can then be copied to the media player. As an example,<br>
the host computer can execute a media management application to create<br>
and manage media assets. One example of a media management<br>
application is iTunes® produced by Apple Computer, Inc.<br>
[0003] Podcasts are typically used to share content from websites.<br>
Podcasts are associated with Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feeds which<br>
use a lightweight XML format. A podcast can be organized into episodes<br>
much like a radio or television program. An interested person can subscribe<br>
to receive podcast episodes that are subsequently published. This is<br>
achieved by the interested person using their computer to access a podcast<br>
website that hosts the RSS feed. The interested person can then subscribe<br>
the RSS feed such that their computer occasionally re-visits the podcast<br>
website to check for any new podcast episodes. Typically, if a new podcast<br>
episode is available, it is downloaded to the computer. Thereafter, the<br>
interested user can play the podcast episode at their computer in the same<br>
manner as other audio files (e.g., MP3 files). A utility program can be used to<br>
download the audio files to a portable media player (e.g., MP3 player). One<br>
example of such a conventional utility program is "iPodder" which is a small<br>
l<br><br>
WO 2006/127271	PCT/US2006/017955<br>
program that runs on one's computer to download audio files to one's portable<br>
media player.<br>
[0004] Unfortunately, podcasts are conventionally not easily managed on<br>
host computer. Podcasts often dynamically change as new episodes are<br>
released. Management of such dynamic media assets is complicated.<br>
Additionally, to the extent that the host computer desires to support a portable<br>
media player, the host computer needs to manage the transfer of podcast<br>
data to the portable media player.<br>
[0005] Thus, there is a need for techniques to manage and use podcasts<br>
on computers.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0006] The invention pertains to improved podcasts and techniques that<br>
facilitate their use. The improved techniques can pertain to creating,<br>
publishing, hosting, accessing, subscribing, managing, transferring, and/or<br>
playing podcasts.<br>
[0007] According to one aspect, a client application can subscribe to<br>
podcasts and then automatically monitor the podcasts for updates. When<br>
updates to the podcasts are available (e.g., new episodes), the updates can<br>
be downloaded to the client application. However, in the event that user<br>
interest in a podcast becomes inadequate, downloading of further updates<br>
can be restricted. According to another aspect, a podcast can be subscribed<br>
to through use of a portable subscription file. The portable subscription files<br>
are portable and transferable across networks, thereby providing a convenient<br>
way to facilitate subscription to podcasts. According to still another aspect,<br>
podcast feeds can be enhanced to include segment elements and other<br>
metadata. The segment links and time indications can be provided for each<br>
of the segments. A client application that present a podcast to a user can<br>
provide an improved graphical user interface through use of the segment<br>
elements and other metadata.<br>
[0008] The invention can be implemented in numerous ways, including as<br>
a method, system, device, apparatus (including graphical user interface), or<br>
computer readable medium. Several embodiments of the invention are<br>
discussed below.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0038] The invention pertains to improved podcasts and techniques that<br>
facilitate their use. The improved techniques can pertain to creating,<br>
publishing, hosting, accessing, subscribing, managing, transferring, and/or<br>
playing podcasts.<br>
5<br><br>
WO 2006/127271	PCT/US2006/017955<br>
[0039] According to one aspect, a client application can subscribe to<br>
podcasts and then automatically monitor the podcasts for updates. When<br>
updates to the podcasts are available (e.g., new episodes), the updates can<br>
be downloaded to the client application. However, in the event that user<br>
interest in a podcast becomes inadequate, downloading of further updates<br>
can be restricted. According to another aspect, a podcast can be subscribed<br>
to through use of a portable subscription file. The portable subscription files<br>
are portable and transferable across networks, thereby providing a convenient<br>
way to facilitate subscription to podcasts. According to still another aspect,<br>
podcast feeds can be enhanced to include segment elements and other<br>
metadata. The segment links and time indications can be provided for each<br>
of the segments. A client application that present a podcast to a user can<br>
provide an improved graphical user interface through use of the segment<br>
elements and other metadata.<br>
[0040] Embodiments of the invention are discussed below with reference<br>
to FIGs. 1-14. However, those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that the<br>
detailed description given herein with respect to these figures is for<br>
explanatory purposes as the invention extends beyond these limited<br>
embodiments.<br>
[0041] FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a media system 100 according to one<br>
embodiment of the invention. The media system 100 includes a media store<br>
server 102 that hosts an on-line media store. The media store server 102 can<br>
off-load commerce transactions and/or delivery of purchased digital media<br>
assets to other servers, if desired. As shown in FIG. 1, the media system 100<br>
includes one or more client devices 104 for use by end users. The client<br>
devices 104 couple to a data network 106. Additionally, the media store<br>
server 102 also couples to the data network 106. In one implementation, the<br>
data network 106 can refer to one or more data networks, typically, high data-<br>
bandwidth networks, namely, wired networks, such as the Internet, Ethernet,<br>
gigabit Ethernet, and fiber optic, as well as wireless networks such as IEEE<br>
802.11(a),(b) or (g) (WiFi), IEEE 802.16 (WiMax), and Ultra-Wide Band<br>
(UWB).<br>
[0042] A computer program 108 (client or client application), typically a<br>
media management application (MMA) or other media player application, runs<br>
6<br><br>
WO 2006/127271	PCT/US2006/017955<br>
on the client device 104. One example of a media management application is<br>
the iTunes® application, produced by Apple Computer, Inc. of Cupertino, CA.<br>
The client devices 104 are, in general, computing devices. As an example,<br>
the client devices 104 can be specific or general-purpose personal computers<br>
(or even portable media players). The client device 104 can couple to a<br>
portable media device 109 (portable media player). One example of a<br>
portable media player suitable for use with the invention is the iPod®, also<br>
produced by Apple Computer, Inc. The computer program 108 can be used<br>
by a consumer for a variety of purposes, including, but not limited to,<br>
browsing, searching, acquiring and/or purchasing media assets (including<br>
podcasts) from the on-line media store provided by the media store server<br>
102, creating and sharing media asset groups (e.g., playlists), organizing<br>
media assets, presenting/playing media assets, transferring media assets<br>
between client devices 104, and synchronizing with portable media devices<br>
109.<br>
[0043] The media system 100 can also includes one or more client devices<br>
110 for use by media programmers. The client devices 110 also run a<br>
computer program 112, typically a media management application (MMA) or<br>
other media player application. The computer program 112 can be the same<br>
as the computer program 108, though the computer program 112 might offer<br>
additional functionality for support of the media programmer. As an example,<br>
the media programmer that uses the computer program 112 might provide<br>
additional functionality for creating and publishing podcasts.<br>
[0044] The media system 100 also includes a digital asset manager 114.<br>
The digital asset manager 114 is coupled to a media assets database 116.<br>
The media assets database 116 stores media asset information including<br>
metadata relating to digital media assets available for purchase at the on-line<br>
media store. The metadata can pertain to individual media assets (digital<br>
media assets) or media asset groups (digital media asset groups). Media<br>
assets can include, but are not limited to, music, video, text, and/or graphics<br>
files. One particular type of media asset or media asset group is a podcast,<br>
which often includes audio, graphics and text (but could also include video).<br>
In the case of music, a media asset group can be a playlist for the music.<br>
One specific example of a type of digital media asset group is referred to as<br>
7<br><br>
WO 2006/127271	PCT/US2006/017955<br>
an iMix™, which is a published playlist currently available for browsing and/or<br>
purchase on Apple Computer's iTunes® Music Store. Another specific<br>
example of a type of digital media asset group is referred to as an<br>
iEssential™, which is a published playlist created by a media programmer and<br>
currently available for browsing and/or purchase on Apple Computer's<br>
iTunes® Music Store. Still another specific example of a type of digital media<br>
asset group is referred to as a Celebrity Playlist, which is a published playlist<br>
created by a celebrity and which could be made available for browsing and/or<br>
purchase on Apple Computer's iTunes® Music Store.<br>
[0045] The media store server 102 enables the user of a particular client<br>
device 104 to acquire media assets (e.g., podcasts). Subsequently, the client<br>
device 104 can download the media assets from the media store server 102,<br>
or some other server, via the data network 106. As will be understood by<br>
those familiar with data networks, other network configurations are possible.<br>
Furthermore, while the media store server 102 and the digital asset manager<br>
114 are shown as individual and separate devices, it will be understood by<br>
those familiar with the art that other configurations are possible. As one<br>
example, each device can be implemented such that it is distributed over<br>
multiple server computers. As another example, these various servers and/or<br>
managers can be implemented by a single physical server computer.<br>
[0046] FIGs. 2A and 2B are flow diagrams of a podcast submission<br>
process 200 according to one embodiment of the invention. The podcast<br>
submission process 200 is, for example, performed by a client (e.g.,<br>
application program). One example of a client is a media management<br>
application operating on a client device.<br>
[0047] The podcast submission process 200 begins with a podcast being<br>
created 202. The podcast can be created during the podcast submission<br>
process 200 or can have been previously created. In one implementation, the<br>
podcast submission process 200 is performed by a single application, such as<br>
the media management application. In another implementation, the podcast<br>
creation can be done in one application and the podcast publication can be<br>
done in another application.<br>
[0048] After the podcast has been created 202, a decision 204 determines<br>
whether publication has been requested. When the decision 204 determines<br>
8<br><br>
WO 2006/127271	PCT/US2006/017955<br>
that a publication request has not been made, the podcast submission<br>
process 200 awaits such a request. On the other hand, once the decision 204<br>
determines that a publication request has been made, a network address<br>
(e.g., podcast feed URL) to the podcast is received 206. In one<br>
implementation, the user of the client would enter the appropriate network<br>
address into a text entry box of a graphical user interface being presented to<br>
the user by the client. The network address to the podcast is then sent 208 to<br>
a server. The server, for example, can be a media store or some other<br>
server. Thereafter, a decision 210 determines whether a podcast review page<br>
has been received. When the decision 210 determines that a podcast review<br>
page has not been received, the podcast submission process 200 awaits the<br>
receipt of the podcast review page. Alternatively, when the decision 210<br>
determines that a podcast review page has been received, the podcast review<br>
page is displayed 212. Typically, the podcast review page includes at least<br>
basic podcast metadata pertaining to the podcast. Once the podcast review<br>
page is displayed 212, the basic podcast data can be changed (i.e., edited).<br>
In addition, the podcast review page can include one or more data entry fields<br>
that facilitate data entry pertaining to additional (or supplemental) podcast<br>
metadata that can be provided by the user.<br>
[0049] Next, a decision 214 determines whether the user of the client<br>
desires to edit (change) the basic podcast metadata or provide additional<br>
podcast metadata with respect to the podcast preview page. When the<br>
decision 214 determines that the user does desire to edit the podcast<br>
metadata, the podcast metadata can be altered 216. As an example, the user<br>
can edit the basic podcast metadata or can enter additional podcast metadata<br>
using the data entry fields. One example additional metadata is to provide a<br>
category classification for the podcast. The additional podcast metadata can<br>
also be referred to as supplemental podcast metadata. Following the block<br>
216, or directly following the decision 214 when altering is not been<br>
performed, a decision 218 determines whether the user has submitted the<br>
podcast metadata. Here, the submission of the podcast metadata indicates<br>
the user's acceptance of the podcast metadata, whether basic or additional<br>
podcast metadata, following any data alterations. Such podcast metadata<br>
being submitted can be referred to as final podcast metadata. Hence, when<br>
9<br><br>
WO 2006/127271	PCT/US2006/017955<br>
the decision 218 determines that the podcast metadata is to be submitted, the<br>
final podcast metadata is submitted 220. Typically, the final podcast<br>
metadata would be submitted 220 to a server, such as the media store server<br>
illustrated in FIG. 1.<br>
[0050] An exemplary RSS feed for a podcast is provided immediately<br>
below. Note as discussed in greater detail hereafter the RSS feed provides<br>
categories for the channel (i.e., show) as well as for each item (i.e., chapter).<br>
For each item, an audio file (e.g., MP3 or AAC format) is identified by a URL.<br>

WO 2006/127271	PCT/US2006/017955<br>
[0051] Since shows and episodes can be associated with categories,<br>
improved user interfaces can be provided such that podcasts can be sorted,<br>
searched or browsed based on category.<br>
[0052] FIGs. 3A and 3B are flow diagrams of a podcast publication<br>
process 300 according to one embodiment of the invention. The podcast<br>
publication process 300 is performed by a server and represents counterpart<br>
processing to that of the podcast submission process 200 illustrated in FIGs.<br>
2A and 2B.<br>
[0053] The podcast publication process 300 initially receives 302 a<br>
network address to a particular podcast that is to be published. For example,<br>
the network address can be provided by a user of the client and then sent to<br>
the server (e.g., blocks 206 and 208 of FIG. 2A).<br>
[0054] After the network address to the particular podcast has been<br>
received 302, the server accesses 304 a podcast feed (e.g., RSS feed) to<br>
acquire podcast feed metadata. In other words, using the network address,<br>
the server connects to the podcast feed for the particular podcast to acquire<br>
podcast feed metadata. Then, basic podcast metadata is obtained 306 from<br>
the podcast feed metadata. The obtaining of the basic podcast metadata can<br>
involve parsing of the podcast feed metadata according to one<br>
implementation. Typically, the podcast feed metadata would include tags or<br>
other markers (e.g., XML elements) to distinguish different fields of metadata<br>
being provided within the podcast feed metadata.<br>
[0055] Next, a podcast review page is created 308. In one<br>
implementation, the podcast review page includes the basic podcast<br>
metadata and requests additional podcast metadata. The podcast review<br>
page is then sent 310 to the client.<br>
[0056] A decision 312 then determines whether a final podcast metadata<br>
submission has been received. When the decision 312 determines that the<br>
final podcast metadata submission has not been received, the podcast<br>
publication process 300 awaits such a submission. On the other hand, once<br>
the decision 312 determines that the final podcast metadata has been<br>
submitted, published podcast information is stored 314 at the server. The<br>
published podcast information includes at least the network address and the<br>
final podcast metadata which are both associated with the particular podcast.<br>
14<br><br>
WO 2006/127271	PCT/US2006/017955<br>
At this point, the particular podcast has been published to the server. In<br>
addition, the published podcast information can be indexed 316 so as to<br>
facilitate search and/or browse capabilities at the server, such as the media<br>
store server 102 of FIG. 1. Finally, the published podcast is rendered 318<br>
available on the server (e.g., media store). Following the operation 318, the<br>
podcast publication process 300 is complete and ends.<br>
[0057] In another embodiment, a podcast publication process, such as the<br>
podcast publication process 300, can be modified to include an authentication<br>
process. The authentication process can be utilized to authenticate the<br>
person who is attempting to publish a podcast. The authentication can<br>
performed in a variety of different ways. In one implementation, the<br>
authentication can authenticate the person attempting to publish as being<br>
known to the server (e.g., account holder). In another implementation, the<br>
authentication can authenticate the person with reference to the podcast host,<br>
creator, etc.<br>
[0058] Browsing or searching of media items available on a server (e.g.,<br>
media store) can be performed much like searching for other types of media<br>
assets. For additional details on searching or browsing for media assets see<br>
U.S. Patent Application No. 10/832,984, filed April 26, 2004, and entitled<br>
"GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE FOR BROWSING, SEARCHING AND<br>
PRESENTING MEDIA ITEMS" [Att.Dkt.No.: APL1P277X1], which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference. However, as to browsing, to facilitate<br>
efficient browsing of podcasts, a graphical user interface having a hierarchy of<br>
lists can be displayed for a user. In one implementation, a first list of<br>
selectable items will be a list of genres. The user will select the genre<br>
denoted "Podcasts". Once the selection is made a second list of selectable<br>
items will be displayed. The selectable items in the second list are denoted<br>
"Categories". The categories are different categories that podcasts can be<br>
assigned to. Then, in response to a category selection, a third list of<br>
selectable items will be displayed. The selectable items in the third list are<br>
denoted "Subcategories" and represent available subcategories of the<br>
selected category, to the extent utilized. After the various selections have<br>
been made those podcasts that match the selected category and selected<br>
subcategory (if used) are displayed in a media asset listing area.<br>
15<br><br>
WO 2006/127271	PCT/US2006/017955<br>
[0059] An application program window can be displayed by the client. The<br>
application program window can include a first sub-window and a second sub-<br>
window. The first sub-window includes a first region, a second region and a<br>
third region. The first region can display a list of available genre (genre list).<br>
After a user has selected one of the items within the genre list being displayed<br>
in the first region (namely, the podcast item), the second region can be<br>
populated with a list of podcast categories that are associated with the<br>
selected genre from the genre list. The list of podcast categories is provided<br>
by the remote server to the application program that presents the application<br>
program window. After the user has selected one of the available categories<br>
of the second region, the third region can be populated with a list of<br>
subcategories that are associated with the selected category. The<br>
subcategories within the third region, if any, are those pertaining to the<br>
selected category. When the list of subcategories has a plurality of items, the<br>
user would select one of the items. Once the user has selected one if the<br>
subcategories (or categories if no subcategories), the second sub-window can<br>
be populated with a list of available podcasts that are associated with the<br>
category and subcategory (if any). The list of available podcasts can display<br>
descriptive information for each of the podcasts. For example, the list of<br>
available podcasts can be presented in a row and column (e.g., table) format<br>
with each row pertaining to a different podcast, and with the columns<br>
pertaining to podcast name, artist, description and price. Further, within the<br>
price column, each of the rows can include a "Subscribe" button that allows<br>
for ease of subscripting to the particular podcast by the user.<br>
[0060] FIG. 4 is a flow diagram of an authentication process 400 according<br>
to one embodiment of the invention. The authentication process 400 can, for<br>
example, be utilized in place of the block 310 illustrated in FIG. 3A. The<br>
authentication process 400 initially determines 402 an e-mail address for an<br>
authorized user (e.g., authorized publisher). The authorized user, in one<br>
embodiment, pertains to an account holder on the server or client. In another<br>
embodiment, the authorized user can be obtained from the RSS feed (i.e.,<br>
podcast data) associated with the podcast to be published. In either case, an<br>
e-mail address associated with an authorized user is determined 402. After<br>
the e-mail address has been determined 402, a publication message is<br>
16<br><br>
WO 2006/127271	PCT/US2006/017955<br>
created 404 having a link to the podcast preview page. As an example, the<br>
publication message can explain to the recipient that they are presumably in<br>
the process of publishing one of their podcasts and to select the enclosed link<br>
to continue the publishing process. In the event the publication of the podcast<br>
is not to be authorized, recipient can cancel the publication process.<br>
[0061] Thereafter, a decision 408 determines whether a request to<br>
continue the publication process has been received from the authorized user.<br>
When the decision 408 determines that a request to continue the publication<br>
process has not been received, the authentication process 400 awaits such a<br>
request. In one implementation, the request is a request to access a podcast<br>
preview page. The request can be made by the user by either selecting the<br>
link in the publication message or copying the link into a data entry area<br>
provided at the client. When the decision 408 determines that a request to<br>
continue the publication process has been received, the podcast review page<br>
is sent 410 to the client. Thereafter, the processing proceeds to operation<br>
312 and subsequent operations of the podcast publication process 300 as<br>
previously discussed.<br>
[0062] FIG. 5A is a screenshot of a network address submission page 500<br>
according to one exemplary embodiment. The network address submission<br>
page 500 enables a user to enter a network address, namely a feed URL, to<br>
an existing podcast that is to be published on a media store, which in this<br>
example is the iTunes® Music Store. The feed URL is entered into a textbox<br>
502. In this example, the feed URL entered is:<br>
"http://www.mygarden.com/gardentalk_rss.xml".<br>
[0063] FIG. 5B is a screenshot of a podcast preview page 520 according to<br>
one exemplary embodiment. In this example, the title of the podcast being<br>
previewed is "Garden Talk". The podcast preview page 520 informs the user<br>
of how the podcast will be presented at the media store. Here, the podcast<br>
metadata being previewed includes: artwork, name, author, short description,<br>
long description, category and language. In this example, much of the<br>
podcast metadata being previewed can be acquired from the podcast feed<br>
itself. However, other metadata, such as category and language, that are not<br>
acquired from the podcast feed can be selected or otherwise entered by the<br>
user. Regardless, the user can be permitted to edit the podcast metadata<br>
17<br><br>
WO 2006/127271	PCT/US2006/017955<br>
being previewed. Additionally, a selection can be made to enable the user<br>
(publisher) to indicate whether the podcast contains explicit content. Once<br>
the user is prepared to accept the podcast metadata being previewed, the<br>
user selects the "Publish" button.<br>
[0064] Once a podcast has been published, the podcast can become<br>
available on a media store (on-line media store). The media store can host or<br>
not host the podcast. If the media store stores all or most of the podcast<br>
content, then the podcast can be considered hosted by the media store. On<br>
the other hand, if the media store only maintains metadata for the podcast,<br>
then the media store does host the podcast. When the media server does not<br>
host the podcast, a third-party server can host the podcast and the media<br>
store accesses the podcast feed as appropriate to acquire any data it needs.<br>
A client would access the podcast feed from the hosting server to acquire<br>
podcast data it desires to store locally. Hence, in one case the media store<br>
holds the content of the podcast, and in another the media store does not hold<br>
the content of the podcast.<br>
[0065] The media store can be configured so that podcasts can be<br>
searched or browsed on the media store. The search or browsed functions<br>
can operate similar to searching for albums on an on-line music store.<br>
However, in the case of podcasts, the search or browse operations are with<br>
respect to podcasts that have been published to the media store. Typically,<br>
with music, browsing is achieved by a hierarchy of levels including artist,<br>
album and song. The corollary in the case of podcasts is a hierarchy of levels<br>
including podcast (or podcast category), show and episodes.<br>
[0066] A media store can also organize podcasts into different categories<br>
to facilitate their discovery by users interacting with the media store.<br>
Examples of categories include: Arts &amp; Entertainment, Biography and Memoir,<br>
Business, Classics, Comedy, Drama &amp; Poetry, Fiction, History, Kids &amp; Young<br>
Adults, Languages, Mystery, and News.<br>
[0067] Still further, certain podcasts that have been published to the media<br>
store can be emphasized on a particular page of the media store. For<br>
example, certain podcasts can be emphasized over other using various<br>
criteria, such as randomly chosen, ratings, most active download,<br>
sponsorship, or the like. Similarly, "new shows" or "just added" shows that<br>
18<br><br>
WO 2006/127271	PCT/US2006/017955<br>
have been recently made available on the media store can be emphasized.<br>
FIG. 8B discussed below provides an example of a web page provided by a<br>
media store wherein certain podcasts are emphasized.<br>
[0068] FIG. 6 is a flow diagram of a media store podcast interaction<br>
process 600 according to one embodiment of the invention. The media store<br>
podcast interaction process 600 initially accesses 602 the media store. Then,<br>
at the media store, a user can navigate 604 to a podcast of interest. The<br>
navigation can take various different forms. One example of navigation is a<br>
search process. Another example of navigation is a browse process. Still<br>
another example of navigation is a manual next entry of a network address<br>
(e.g., RSS feed URL). Regardless of how the navigation occurs, once the<br>
podcast of interest is identified, a podcast page for the podcast of interest is<br>
rendered 606. The podcast page can be rendered 606 on a display (display<br>
screen) associated with a client device, such as the client device 104<br>
illustrated in FIG. 1. A podcast page can include information (e.g., metadata)<br>
pertaining to the podcast, including a description of the podcast, artwork and<br>
episodes information. The podcast page can also facilitate subscribing to the<br>
podcast or getting particular episodes. Still further, the podcast page could<br>
permit user ratings. The podcast page might also provide a link to facilitate a<br>
user reporting some sort of concern.<br>
[0069] After the podcast page is rendered 606, a user of the client device<br>
(client) can interact with the podcast page to make any of a number of<br>
different selections. These selection can initiate operations at the client<br>
device. Two particular operations associated with podcasts are (1)<br>
subscribing to a podcast, and (2) downloading a particular episodes of a<br>
podcast.<br>
[0070] A decision 608 determines whether a subscribe selection has been<br>
made. When the decision 608 determines that a subscribe selection has<br>
been made, a subscribe process 610 is performed. A subscribe process 610<br>
operates to subscribe the client device (or client) with a host device for the<br>
podcast of interest. Alternatively, when the decision 608 determines that a<br>
subscribe selection has not been made, a decision 612 determines whether<br>
an episodes selection has been made. When the decision 612 determines<br>
that an episode selection has been made, episode data pertaining to the<br>
19<br><br>
WO 2006/127271	PCT/US2006/017955<br>
episode selection is downloaded 614. Here, the episode data would be<br>
downloaded 614 to the client device. In one implementation, the episode data<br>
includes at least an audio file and database content. The database content<br>
may be part of the audio file or a separate file or otherwise provided. On the<br>
other hand, when the decision 612 determines that an episodes selection has<br>
not been made, then a decision 616 determines whether another selection<br>
has been made. When the decision 616 determines that another selection<br>
has been made, other processing 616 can be performed. Following the<br>
blocks 610, 614 and 618, as well as following the decision 616 when there are<br>
no other selections, a decision 620 determines whether the media store<br>
podcast interaction process 600 should end. When the decision 620<br>
determines that the media store podcast interaction process 600 should not<br>
end, the processing returns to repeat the block 604 and subsequent blocks.<br>
Alternatively, when the decision 620 determines that the media store podcast<br>
interaction process 600 should end, then the media store podcast interaction<br>
process 600 is complete and ends.<br>
[0071] FIG. 7 is a flow diagram of an integrated podcast acquisition<br>
process 700 according to one embodiment of the invention. The integrated<br>
podcast acquisition process 700 is performed by a client device, such as the<br>
client device 104 illustrated in FIG. 1. More specifically, the integrated<br>
podcast acquisition process 700 is performed by a media management<br>
application, such as the media management application 108 operating on the<br>
client device 104 illustrated in FIG. 1. More generally, the media<br>
management application can be referred to as a client or client application.<br>
[0072] The integrated podcast acquisition process 700 initially discovers<br>
702 a podcast of interest. The podcast of interest can be discovered 702<br>
through interaction with respect to a media store, such as discussed above<br>
with respect to FIG. 6. After the podcast of interest has been discovered 702,<br>
a user or client can subscribe 704 to the podcast. Once subscribed 704 to the<br>
podcast, the client can receive 706 at least data for a most recent episode of<br>
the podcast. Although the client could receive data for other episodes, given<br>
the large number of episodes that can be present, it may be more efficient<br>
and prudent to only initially receive the most recent episode. As discussed<br>
20<br><br>
WO 2006/127271	PCT/US2006/017955<br>
below, the user or client will be able to request to receive other prior episodes<br>
if so desired.<br>
[0073] Next, a decision 708 determines whether synchronization should be<br>
performed between the client and a media device. The media device has<br>
typically previously been associated with the client. When the decision 708<br>
determines that synchronization with the media device should be performed,<br>
the episode data (for the most recent episode) can be downloaded 710 to the<br>
media device. In one embodiment, the data received includes an audio file<br>
(e.g., MP3 file or MPEG4 file or AAC file) as well as metadata pertaining<br>
thereto. At the client or client device, in one embodiment, the audio file can<br>
be stored in a file system and the metadata can be stored in a database.<br>
Following the block 710, or following the decision 708 when synchronization<br>
with the media device is not be performed, the client can be configured 712 to<br>
update for new episodes. Here, the configuration for updating can be set-up<br>
for an individual podcast or for groups of podcasts, or for all podcasts. As an<br>
example, one configuration parameter is how often to check for updates to the<br>
podcasts. Following the block 712, the integrated podcast acquisition process<br>
700 is complete and ends.<br>
[0074] Interestingly, in one embodiment, a single client application (e.g.,<br>
media management application) operating on a client device can carry out the<br>
operations in FIG. 7. More particularly, the client application can discover a<br>
podcast, subscribe to a podcast, receive podcast data (including metadata<br>
and content), manage podcasts, and transfer podcast data to (or remove<br>
from) a media device (e.g., a portable media device, such as a media player).<br>
Still further, in another embodiment, the client application can also include a<br>
podcast creation or authoring capabilities. This high degree of integration<br>
enables improved operation as well as greater ease of user and greater user<br>
satisfaction.<br>
[0075] FIG. 8A is a flow diagram a podcast update process 800 according<br>
to one embodiment of the invention. The podcast update process 800<br>
generally determines when and how any podcast is updated at a client so as<br>
to obtain any new episodes associated with the podcast.<br>
[0076] The podcast update process 800 begins with a decision 802 that<br>
determines whether a podcast update is to be performed. The podcast<br>
21<br><br>
WO 2006/127271	PCT/US2006/017955<br>
update can, for example, be determined based on the configuration 712 for<br>
update provided in FIG. 7. When the decision 802 determines that a podcast<br>
update has not be performed, the podcast update process 800 is deferred.<br>
Once the decision 802 determines that a podcast update is to be performed,<br>
existing podcast subscriptions are identified 804. Here, it is assumed that the<br>
podcast update process 800 is commonly performed for a group or all of the<br>
podcasts residing on the client. Once the existing podcast subscriptions have<br>
been identified 804, a first podcast is selected 806. The podcast host for the<br>
selected podcast is accessed 808. The podcast host is typically a third-party<br>
server that provides the RSS podcast feed. However, the podcast host can<br>
also be the media store, if the media store is hosting the podcast.<br>
[0077] Next, data for any newer episodes of the podcast are received 810.<br>
The data for the newer episodes of the podcast can be received from the<br>
podcast host. For example, though examination of the RSS podcast feed,<br>
any newer existing episodes can be identified and then downloaded. The<br>
client can maintain data indicating which episodes is already has received.<br>
[0078] Thereafter, a decision 812 determines whether there are more<br>
podcasts (i.e., identified podcasts) to be updated. When the decision 812<br>
determines that there are more podcasts to be updated, the podcast update<br>
process 800 returns to repeat the block 806 and subsequent blocks. When<br>
the decision 812 determines that there are no more podcast to the updated, a<br>
decision 814 determines whether synchronization with a media device should<br>
be performed. When the decision 814 determines that synchronization with a<br>
media device should be performed, episode data (new episode data) can be<br>
downloaded 816 to the media device. Following the block 816, or following<br>
the decision 814 when synchronization is not be performed, the podcast<br>
update process 800 ends.<br>
[0079] FIGs. 8B, 8C and 8D are screenshots associated with presentation<br>
of podcasts on an on-line media store. In this example, the on-line media<br>
store is the iTunes® Music Store, which also provides capabilities to browse<br>
and search for podcasts.<br>
[0080] FIG. 8B is a screenshot of a podcast base page 820 according to<br>
one exemplary embodiment of the invention. A source indicator 822 indicates<br>
that the podcast base page 820 is provided by the on-line media store. A<br>
22<br><br>
WO 2006/127271	PCT/US2006/017955<br>
selector 824 also indicates that "podcasts" is the type of media being<br>
presented. An emphasis area 826 contains artwork associated with three<br>
different podcasts by emphasized. The podcast base page 820 also includes<br>
a daily top download area 828 that identifies those top download podcasts for<br>
the day. The podcast base page 820 also includes some grouping of<br>
podcasts, such groupings as New Shows 830, Just Added 832, and featured<br>
podcasts 836. These groupings can be displayed with a scroll window that<br>
can transition (e.g., horizontally) in accordance with a transition effect. The<br>
podcast base page 820 further includes another emphasis area 834.<br>
[0081] Once a particular podcast is selected, a podcast page is presented.<br>
FIG. 8C is a screenshot of a podcast page 838 according to one exemplary<br>
embodiment of the invention. The podcast page 838 includes a metadata<br>
region 840 and an episode listing area 842. The metadata region 840<br>
includes podcast artwork 844, podcast title 846, and other metadata<br>
information 848 (e.g., total episodes, category, language, and copyright<br>
information. A "Subscribe" button 850 is also displayed. In addition, the<br>
metadata region 840 also includes a description 852 for the podcast. The<br>
episode listing area 842 contains a list 854 of episodes of the podcast that are<br>
available. Each of the episodes in the list 854 includes a "Get Episode" button<br>
856 to obtain the corresponding episode. By selecting the "Subscribe" button<br>
850, the user can cause the media management application to subscribe to<br>
the podcast. In this example, there is no cost to subscribe to the podcast.<br>
However, in other embodiments, there can be a charge imposed to subscribe<br>
to a podcast. By selecting the "Get Episode" button 856, the user can cause<br>
the media management application to obtain the particular episode.<br>
[0082] FIG. 8D is a screenshot of the podcast page 838 having a<br>
subscribe confirmation dialog 858 that permits the user to confirm that they<br>
want to subscribe to the podcast.<br>
[0083] FIG. 8E is a screenshot of a podcast availability page 860<br>
according to one exemplary embodiment of the invention. The podcast<br>
availability page 860 includes an indicator 862 that indicates that podcasts are<br>
to be listed in a media asset list 864. The podcasts are listed in the media<br>
asset list 864 can include sublistings of episodes. These podcasts listed in<br>
the media asset list 864 are resident on a client device. Typically, these<br>
23<br><br>
WO 2006/127271	PCT/US2006/017955<br>
podcasts were previously downloaded from the appropriate hosting server to<br>
the client device. Indicators 866 can be used to visually identify those of the<br>
podcasts being listed that are available from the on-line media store. For<br>
example, the indicators 866 can identify those podcasts that are hosted on the<br>
on-line media store. By selecting any of the episodes, the associated audio<br>
can be played for the user. A selector 868 indicates that the episode entitle<br>
"Additional Shopping" is being played for the user, with the associated artwork<br>
869 of the podcast, episode or chapter being displayed.<br>
[0084] FIG. 8F is a screenshot of a podcast availability page 870 according<br>
to another exemplary embodiment of the invention. The podcast availability<br>
page 870 includes a media asset list 871 similar to the media asset list 864 of<br>
FIG. 8E. In this example, the media asset list includes episodes 872 that are<br>
not able to be played because the episode data has not been downloaded to<br>
the client device. In this example, these episodes 872 are shown highlighted<br>
and with "Get" buttons 874. On selection of a "Get" button 874, the<br>
corresponding episode 872 would be acquired from the appropriate hosting<br>
server.<br>
[0085] In general, when listing of podcasts provided by the media store or<br>
available locally via a client machine, the listing can be organized in a variety<br>
of different ways. One example of a listing organization is to sort the podcasts<br>
in accordance with ratings. For additional information on use of ratings with<br>
respect to a media store, see (i) U.S. Patent Application No. 11/114,914, filed<br>
April 25, 2005, and entitled "PUBLISHING, BROWSING, RATING AND<br>
PURCHASING OF GROUPS OF MEDIA ITEMS"; and (ii) U.S. Patent<br>
Application No. 11/115,090, filed April 25, 2005, and entitled "PUBLISHING,<br>
BROWSING AND PURCHASING OF GROUPS OF MEDIA ITEMS".<br>
[0086] FIG. 8G is a screenshot of a podcast availability page 876<br>
according to another exemplary embodiment of the invention. The podcasts<br>
listed in the podcast availability page 876 are similar to those listed the<br>
podcast availability page 870 illustrated in FIG. 8F. The podcast availability<br>
page 876 illustrates indicators 878 that visually identify those episodes of a<br>
podcast that in the process of being downloaded to the client device. Here,<br>
the episodes being downloaded are listed as existing but not yet present on<br>
the client device. Once the download of these episodes begins, the indicators<br>
24<br><br>
WO 2006/127271	PCT/US2006/017955<br>
878 are displayed. After the episodes are download, the indicators 878 as<br>
well as any highlighting are removed.<br>
[0087] As noted above, following initial subscription to a podcast, the<br>
podcast needs to be updated to acquire new episodes. To provide efficiency<br>
and intelligence in the manner of seeking such updates, the client (e.g., media<br>
management application) can use preference settings to bias or determine<br>
when updates are to be performed. These preference settings can be<br>
provided for all podcasts globally or on an individual podcast basis. For<br>
example, preference settings can indicate to check for new episodes<br>
periodically (e.g., hourly, daily, weekly) or whenever the client is launched.<br>
[0088] Once the episodes of the podcasts have be stored at the client<br>
device, some or all of the episodes can be copied to a portable media player<br>
that can operatively connect to the client device. To provide efficiency and<br>
intelligence in the manner of performing such copying (also known as<br>
synchronization), the client (e.g., media management application) can use<br>
preference settings to bias or determine when copying is to be performed<br>
(namely, automatically performed). These preference settings can be<br>
provided for all podcasts globally or on an individual podcast basis. The<br>
preferences can vary with implementation. Some examples of preferences<br>
include: (1) remove episode after it has been listened to on client device, (2)<br>
remove episode after it has been listened to on portable media device, (3)<br>
retain/download n most recent episodes, (4) retain/download up to n<br>
episodes, and (5) retain/download based on dates.<br>
[0089] In one exemplary embodiment, a synchronization preference<br>
screen can be available to a user. The synchronization preference screen<br>
enables a user to set certain synchronization preferences for copying updates<br>
to podcasts from a client device to a portable media device. In particular, as<br>
an example, a user can choose to: (1) automatically update all podcasts, (2)<br>
automatically update only selected podcasts, (3) manually manage podcasts<br>
(i.e., no automatic updating), and (4) delete podcasts from the portable media<br>
player after they have been played. Other criteria (not shown) that could be<br>
used includes download up to n episodes and/or download only those of the<br>
episodes not yet listened to. For example, if a particular episode was listened<br>
25<br><br>
WO 2006/127271	PCT/US2006/017955<br>
to at the client device, it is likely that the user may not want to download that<br>
episode to the portable media device.<br>
[0090] Note that by deleting those podcasts that have been listened to<br>
from the portable media player, the portable media player can maintain only<br>
those of the podcast episodes that the user has not yet listened to. Here, the<br>
removal of the episodes that have been played is automatic. In one<br>
embodiment, an episode can be deemed played if substantially all of the<br>
podcast episode has been played. For example, an episode can been<br>
deemed as having been played if 95% of the episode has been played.<br>
[0091] Another aspect of the invention pertains to improved approaches to<br>
enable subscription to podcasts. In one embodiment, small, portable<br>
electronic files referred to as podcast subscription files can be used to<br>
facilitate easy subscription to podcasts. Indeed, in one implementation, by<br>
simply selecting or opening a podcast subscription file (e.g., double-clicking<br>
on it), subscription can be completely carried out in an automated manner.<br>
[0092] FIG. 9 is a flow diagram of a podcast subscription file creation<br>
process 900 according to one embodiment of the invention. The podcast<br>
subscription file creation process 900 is, for example, performed by a client<br>
(client program), such as a media management application. The podcast<br>
subscription file creation process 900 initially creates 902 a portable podcast<br>
subscription file. The portable podcast subscription file is an electronic file<br>
that contains information that facilitates subscription to a podcast. After the<br>
portable podcast subscription file has been created 902, the portable podcast<br>
subscription file is made 904 available to others. The portable podcast<br>
subscription file can thereafter distributed, as desired, and then used to<br>
facilitate subscribing to the podcast.<br>
[0093] In one embodiment, the portable podcast subscription file is an XML<br>
document (or other markup language type document) that includes podcast<br>
information that facilitates subscription to the podcast. As an example, the<br>
podcast information within the XML document includes at least a feed URL for<br>
the podcast feed. Additionally, the podcast information may include other<br>
descriptive information concerning the podcast, such as title and description.<br>
A representative example of a portable podcast subscription file is as follows:<br>
26<br><br>
WO 2006/127271	PCT/US2006/017955<br><feed xmlns:it="http://www.itunes.com/ext/chapters/1.0&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;link rel=" feed href="itpc://foo.com/podcasts/myfeed.xml"></feed><br><title>My Podcast</title>
<br><description>l talk about random things.</description><br><br>
Note that the link named "feed" is associated with a URL (feed URL) that<br>
points to a podcastfeed (e.g., "myfeed"). This portable podcast subscription<br>
file also includes a title ("My Podcast") and a description ("I talk about random<br>
things") for the associated podcast. The XML format is a markup language<br>
format using tags to distinguish the different data items within the document.<br>
[0094] FIG. 10 is a flow diagram of a podcast subscription file usage<br>
process 1000 according to one embodiment of the invention. The podcast<br>
subscription file usage process 1000 is, for example, performed by a client,<br>
such as a media management application, operating on a client device.<br>
[0095] The podcast subscription file usage process 1000 initially obtains<br>
1002 a portable podcast subscription file (PPSF). The portable podcast<br>
subscription file can be obtained 1000 in advance of other processing<br>
performed by the podcast subscription file usage process. That is, a decision<br>
1004 determines whether a request to open the portable podcast subscription<br>
file has been made. For example, the request to open can signal an<br>
OpenURL event. When the decision 1004 determines that a request to open<br>
a portable podcast subscription file has not been made, the podcast<br>
subscription file usage process 1000 simply awaits such a request.<br>
[0096] Once the decision 1004 determines that a request to open a<br>
portable podcast subscription file has been made, a decision 1006 determines<br>
whether a media management application (MMA) is running. Typically, the<br>
media management application would be running on a client device. When<br>
the decision 1006 determines that the media management application is not<br>
currently running, then the media management application is launched 1008.<br>
Following the block 1008, or following the decision 1006 when the media<br>
management application is determined to be running, the portable podcast<br>
subscription file is parsed 1010 to acquire at least a feed URL to the<br>
associated podcast. In one implementation, the request to open the portable<br>
27<br><br>
WO 2006/127271	PCT/US2006/017955<br>
podcast subscription file can be a URL scheme ("itpc" or "pcast") that is<br>
recognized by the media management application as an XML document to be<br>
parsed and used to subscribe to a podcast.<br>
[0097] Next, the podcast subscription file usage process 1000 subscribes<br>
1012 to the associated podcast. The subscription 1012 to the associated<br>
podcast can be automatically performed without any feedback or input from a<br>
user of the media management application. However, if desired, additional<br>
processing can be performed to display descriptive information concerning the<br>
podcast and/or to query the user as to whether they want to subscribe. In<br>
other words, the user can confirm that they desire to subscribe to the<br>
associated podcast and/or the user can receive additional information<br>
concerning the podcast (e.g., title, description, etc.) for which they are about<br>
to subscribe. Regardless, following the block 1012, the podcast subscription<br>
file usage process 1000 ends.<br>
[0098] FIG. 11 is a podcast subscription system 1100 according to one<br>
embodiment of the invention. The podcast subscription system 1100 includes<br>
a client device A 1102, a client device B 1104, and a podcast host server<br>
1106, each of which operatively connects to a data network 1008. The client<br>
device B 1102 includes a media management application (MMA) 1110, and<br>
the client device B 1104 includes a media management application (MMA)<br>
1112. The client device A 1102 creates or otherwise acquires a portable<br>
podcast subscription file 1114. The portable podcast subscription file 1114<br>
can be transferred to one or more other client devices. In this example, the<br>
portable podcast subscription file 1114 can be assumed to be created by the<br>
media management application 1110.<br>
[0099] Once the media management application 1110 has the portable<br>
podcast subscription file, the media management application 1110 can<br>
transfer the portable podcast subscription file 1114 through the data network<br>
1108. in this example, it is assumed that the portable podcast subscription<br>
file 1114 is transferred through the data network 1108 to that media<br>
management application 1112 of the client device B. 1104. Hence, as shown<br>
in FIG. 11, the portable podcast subscription file 1114 is shown in a dashed<br>
box within the client device B. 1104.<br>
28<br><br>
WO 2006/127271	PCT/US2006/017955<br>
[00100] Thereafter, the media management application 1112 of the client<br>
device B 1104 can utilize the portable podcast subscription file 1114 to<br>
subscribe to an associated podcast. More particularly, if a user of the client<br>
device B 1104 were to "open" the portable podcast subscription file 1114,<br>
such as by a double-click action, the media management application 1112<br>
would process the "open" request as a request to subscribe the media<br>
management application 1112 to the podcast. In this example, the podcast<br>
resides on the podcast host server 1106. In particular, the portable podcast<br>
subscription file 1114 would be parsed by the media management application<br>
1112 to obtain a feed URL to a podcast feed 1116 for the podcast which<br>
reside on the podcast host server 1106. The media management application<br>
1112 can then access the podcast feed 1116 to acquire and then store certain<br>
podcast information at the client device B 1104.<br>
[00101] It should be understood that, in general, a portable podcast<br>
subscription file (e.g., a portable podcast subscription file 1114) can be<br>
transferred to one or more other client devices in a variety of different ways.<br>
For example, the portable podcast subscription file can be sent via an<br>
electronic-mail message to a user associated with a client device. The user<br>
can then open the portable podcast subscription file to activate the<br>
subscription to the podcast. In another example, the portable podcast<br>
subscription file can be associated with a link on a web page. Then, when a<br>
user at the web site selects the link associated with a web page, the portable<br>
podcast subscription file can be downloaded to the client device associated<br>
with the user and then processed by the media management application to<br>
subscribe to the podcast. In still another example, the portable podcast<br>
subscription file can be transferred by a portable computer readable medium,<br>
such as a flash memory card on a floppy disk, or compact disc.<br>
[00102] Another aspect of the invention pertains to deactivating<br>
subscriptions to podcasts. More particularly, this aspect of the invention<br>
deactivates subscriptions that are deemed inactive. In one embodiment, the<br>
deactivation process can be automatically performed. One advantage of<br>
deactivating subscriptions that are deemed inactive is that network bandwidth<br>
can be conserved. Another advantage of deactivating subscriptions that are<br>
deemed inactive can be that a host server hosting the podcast is not<br>
29<br><br>
WO 2006/127271	PCT/US2006/017955<br>
burdened with download requests from client applications whose users having<br>
little or no interest in the podcast.<br>
[00103] FIG. 12 is a flow diagram of a podcast update process 1200<br>
according to one embodiment of the invention. The podcast update process<br>
1200 is, for example, performed by a client, such as a media management<br>
application.<br>
[00104] The podcast update process 1200 begins with a decision 1202 that<br>
determines whether a podcast update is to be performed. When the decision<br>
1202 determines that a podcast update is to not be performed, then the<br>
podcast update process 1200 waits until a podcast update is to be performed.<br>
In other words, the podcast update process 1200 is effectively invoked when<br>
a podcast update is to be performed. A podcast update can be requested by<br>
a client or a user of the client. For example, the client might periodically<br>
automatically initiate a podcast update.<br>
[00105] On the other hand, when the decision 1202 determines that a<br>
podcast update is to be performed, then a podcast feed (e.g., RSS feed) for a<br>
particular podcast is accessed 1204 to acquire episode information for the<br>
podcast. Then, new episodes for the podcast are determined 1206 based on<br>
the acquired episode information. In one implementation, the acquired<br>
episode information is an XML file that contains metadata describing<br>
characteristics of the particular podcast, including the various episodes of the<br>
podcast. The XML file can be parsed to obtain episode information (e.g.,<br>
episode metadata). An examination of the episode information can serve to<br>
identify the new episodes of the podcast as compared to those episodes that<br>
are either older in time or already previously made available at the client.<br>
[00106] Next, a decision 1208 determines whether there are new episodes<br>
of the podcast to download. Here, the new episodes are available from the<br>
host server for the podcast and are thus available to be downloaded to the<br>
client. When the decision 1208 determines that there are new episodes to be<br>
downloaded, the podcast update process 1200 determines 1210 whether the<br>
podcast is inactive. When the decision 1212 determines that the podcast is<br>
not inactive, then the new episodes are downloaded 1214 to the client. After<br>
the new episodes have been downloaded 1214, the podcast update process<br>
1200 is complete and ends with the client having received a podcast update.<br>
30<br><br>
WO 2006/127271	PCT/US2006/017955<br>
On the other hand, when the decision 1208 determines that there are no new<br>
episodes to download, or when the decision 1212 determines that the podcast<br>
is inactive, then the podcast update process 1200 is complete and ends<br>
without having downloaded any new episodes.<br>
[00107] FIG. 13 is a flow diagram of a podcast activity process 1300<br>
according to one embodiment of the invention. The podcast activity process<br>
1300 is generally utilized to determine whether a podcast is either active or<br>
inactive. As an example, the podcast activity process 1300 can be utilized as<br>
the processing performed by the determination 1210 illustrated in FIG. 12,<br>
according to one embodiment of the invention. In this embodiment, at least a<br>
pair of variables is maintained for each podcast (that has been subscribed to)<br>
to facilitate the determination of whether the podcast is active or inactive. In<br>
this exemplary embodiment, the variables are an episode download count and<br>
a date of initial episode download.<br>
[00108] The podcast activity process 1300 begins with a decision 1302 that<br>
determines whether an episode download count is greater than an integer N.<br>
When the decision 1302 determines that the episode download count is<br>
greater then N, a decision 1304 determines whether more than M days have<br>
passed since the date of initial episode download, where M is an integer. For<br>
example, the integers M and N can equal five (5). When the decision 1304<br>
determines that more than M days have passed since the date of the initial<br>
episode download, a decision 1306 determines whether the client has been<br>
active since the date of initial episode download. When the decision 1306<br>
determines that the client has been active since the date of initial episode<br>
download, the podcast is rendered 1308 inactive. Here, in this embodiment,<br>
the podcast is rendered 1308 inactive because the podcast activity process<br>
1300 has programmatically determined that there has been insufficient activity<br>
with respect to the podcast. Consequently, it is presumed that the user of the<br>
client has little or no interest in the podcast. As a result, the download 1214 of<br>
new episodes by the podcast update process 1200 of FIG. 12 is bypassed,<br>
thereby conserving network and server resources.<br>
[00109] On the other hand, when the decision 1302 determines that the<br>
episode download count is not greater than N, or when the decision 1304<br>
determines that there are not more than M days since the date of the initial<br>
31<br><br>
WO 2006/127271	PCT/US2006/017955<br>
episode download, or when the decision 1306 determines that the client has<br>
not been active since the data initial episode download, then the podcast is<br>
rendered 1310 active. Following the blocks 1308 and 1310, the podcast<br>
activity process 1300 is complete and ends.<br>
[00110] FIG. 14 is a flow diagram of a reset activity variables process 1400<br>
according to one embodiment of the invention. The reset activity variables<br>
process 1400 is, for example, performed by the client operating on a client<br>
device. The client operates to reset activity variables at appropriate times<br>
during its operation so as to impact the podcast activity process 1300<br>
described above with respect FIG. 13. In other words, at certain times, the<br>
activity variables utilized by the podcast activity process 1300 can be reset to<br>
affect the operation of the podcast activity process 1300. For example, the<br>
activity variables being reset can include an episode download count or a date<br>
of initial episode download. Note that these reset variables can directly affect<br>
the decisions 1302,1304 and 1306 of the podcast activity process 1300,<br>
[00111] The reset activity variables process 1400 begins with a decision<br>
1402 that determines whether a reset condition has been established. The<br>
reset condition can be established in a variety of different ways. The reset<br>
condition can be initiated automatically or by a user. In any case, when the<br>
decision 1402 determines that a reset condition does not exist, then the<br>
recent activity variables processed 1400 awaits such a condition. In other<br>
words, the reset activity variables processed 1400 begins when an<br>
appropriate reset condition has been reached. Once the decision 1402<br>
determines that the appropriate reset condition has been reached, the<br>
episode download count is reset 1404. Here, the episode download count<br>
can be reset 1404 to zero. In addition, the date of initial episode download is<br>
reset 1406. Here, the date of the initial episode can be reset 1404 to the<br>
current date. Following the block 1406, the reset activity variables process<br>
1400 is complete and ends.<br>
[00112] Although the reset condition can be established in a variety of ways,<br>
when programmatically or user initiated, events occurring on the client can<br>
cause the reset condition. In general, the reset condition is programmatically<br>
triggered when the client understands the client, or the user of the client, to<br>
have expressed interest in the podcast. Examples of events that express an<br>
32<br><br>
WO 2006/127271	PCT/US2006/017955<br>
interest in the podcast are: (1) user plays an episode of the podcast, (2) client<br>
(or portable media player) completes playing of an episode of the podcast,<br>
and (3) user downloads an episode of the podcast.<br>
[00113] Another aspect of the invention pertains to chapter enhancements<br>
to podcasts. The chapter enhancements can provide an improved user<br>
interface for use with podcasts. The chapter enhancements are enabled by<br>
podcasts containing chapter information. For example, the chapter<br>
information can be displayed in various ways to enhance the playback<br>
experience.<br>
[00114] The chapter information can include, but is not limited to: title,<br>
picture, url, description (e.g., in rich text, including embedded links), movies<br>
(audio &amp; video), artist, album, and podcast subscriptions. All chapter<br>
information is optional - e.g., some chapters may have titles and pictures and<br>
other chapters may only have a title.<br>
[00115] Podcasts can carry chapter information either embedded in the file<br>
(e.g., XML file) or carried in the podcast feed.<br>
[00116] To embed chapter information into a file, a m4a file format can be<br>
extended to support the additional chapter information. The track information<br>
is formatted according to ISO file formats. A track, marked as a chapter track,<br>
can contain the chapter information. The tracks can be name tracks, url<br>
tracks, picture tracks, description tracks, or other metadata tracks. At the start<br>
of any of the chapters, the chapter information included within the user<br>
interface can be changed so as to correspond with the chapter.<br>
[00117] To provide chapter information in the podcast feed, the podcasts,<br>
namely the RSS feeds for podcasts, can be enhanced to include chapter<br>
related information. This chapter related information can be specified by<br>
newly specified XML elements, (e.g., chapter tags). A client application, e.g.,<br>
media management application, that understands these XML elements can<br>
retrieve the chapter related information from RSS feeds and thus provide an<br>
enhanced user interface at a client device (or a portable media device<br>
associated with the client device). The chapter related information can be<br>
text, audio, images and/or video. In the event that the client application does<br>
not understand the newly specified chapter elements, the RSS feed is still<br>
otherwise useable, though without the user interface enhancements.<br>
33<br><br>
WO 2006/127271	PCT/US2006/017955<br>
[00118] In one embodiment, the newly specified XML elements are: (i) a<br>
segment element which acts as a container element signaling a segment (i.e.,<br>
chapter); and (ii) a link element - one or more of these defining multimedia<br>
elements (pictures, auxiliary audio, auxiliary video) associated with the<br>
segment. Each segment can have a start time, title, and URL to a multimedia<br>
element. For example, at the start time, the title and multimedia element are<br>

[00120] The user interface enhancements (for a client application or<br>
portable media device) facilitated by the existence of chapter information can<br>
include any of the following example. As one example, a chapter picture can<br>
be shown as related to the chapter of the podcast. As the podcast is played,<br>
the chapter picture automatically changes to correspond to the current<br>
chapter. The chapter picture may also change as the user jumps (e.g.,<br>
scrubs) from chapter to chapter when navigating through the chapters. An<br>
another example, when a user selects a popup menu to select a chapter,<br>
each menu item in the popup menu contains a chapter title and also a<br>
thumbnail of the chapter picture. As still another example, when a user<br>
selects (e.g., clicks on) a chapter picture, the client application links<br>
(hyperlinks) to a chapter URL. In yet another example, the chapter<br>
information can vary as the chapter changes. Here, chapter artist, show,<br>
description and other information can be displayed in various parts of the user<br>
interface such that it can changes as the chapter changes. In still yet another<br>
example, a subscription link can be utilized as chapter information. If the<br>
subscription link is selected, the client application will automatically subscribe<br>
to the podcast feed. In one embodiment, the subscription link can point to a<br>
portable subscription file.<br>
[00121] Although the media assets (or media items) of emphasis in several<br>
of the above embodiments were podcasts, which include audio items (e.g.,<br>
audio files or audio tracks), the media assets are not limited to audio items.<br>
For example, the media assets can alternatively pertain to videos (e.g.,<br>
movies) or images (e.g., photos). More generally, podcasts can also be<br>
referred to as digital multimedia assets.<br>
[00122] The various aspects, embodiments, implementations or features of<br>
the invention can be used separately or in any combination.<br>
[00123] The invention is preferably implemented by software, but can also<br>
be implemented in hardware or a combination of hardware and software. The<br>
invention can also be embodied as computer readable code on a computer<br>
35<br><br>
WO 2006/127271	PCT/US2006/017955<br>
readable medium. The computer readable medium is any data storage<br>
device that can store data which can thereafter be read by a computer<br>
system. Examples of the computer readable medium include read-only<br>
memory, random-access memory, CD-ROMs, DVDs, magnetic tape, optical<br>
data storage devices, and carrier waves. The computer readable medium can<br>
also be distributed over network-coupled computer systems so that the<br>
computer readable code is stored and executed in a distributed fashion.<br>
[00124] The many features and advantages of the present invention are<br>
apparent from the written description and, thus, it is intended by the appended<br>
claims to cover all such features and advantages of the invention. Further,<br>
since numerous modifications and changes will readily occur to those skilled<br>
in the art, the invention should not be limited to the exact construction and<br>
operation as illustrated and described. Hence, all suitable modifications and<br>
equivalents may be resorted to as falling within the scope of the invention.<br>
