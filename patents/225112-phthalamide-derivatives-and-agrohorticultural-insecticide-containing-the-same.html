BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a phthalamide derivative or salt thereof, an agrohorticultural insecti¬cide containing said compound as an active ingredient thereof, and a method for using the agrohorticultural agent.<br>
RELATED ART<br>
JP-A-61-180753 discloses some of the phthalamide derivatives of the present invention.  However, in that patent application specification, there is neither disclosed nor suggested about usefulness of said deriva¬tives as an agrohorticultural insecticide.  Further, although similar compounds are disclosed in JP-Ar5_9-163353. and J. c. s. Perlcin I, 1338-1350 (1978), etc., there is made no mention nor suggestion in these publications about usefulness of those compounds as an agrohorticultural insecticide.<br>

The present inventors have conducted extensive studies with the aim of developing a novel agrohorti¬cultural agent. As a result, it has been found that the phthalamide derivatives of the present invention represented by general formula (I), which are novel<br><br>
compounds not found in literature, can be put to a novel use as an agrohorticultural insecticide comprising not only these novel compounds but also some known compounds disclosed in prior art.  Based on this finding, the present invention has been accomplished.<br>

The liquid carrier is that which itself has solubility or which is without such solubility but is capable of dispersing an active ingredient with the aid of an adjuvant.  The following are typical examples of the<br><br>
liquid carrier and can be used alone or as a mixture thereof, water; alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, butanol and ethylene glycol; ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, diisobutyl ketone and cyclohexanone; ethers such as ethyl ether, dioxane, Cellosolve, dipropyl ether and tetrahydro-furan; aliphatic hydrocarbons such as kerosene and mineral oils; aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, xylene, solvent naphtha and alkylnaphthalenes; halogenated hydrocarbons such as dichloroethane, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride and chlorobenzene; esters such as ethyl acetate, diisopropyl phthalate, dibutyl phthalate and dioctyl phthalate; amides such as dimethylformamide, diethylformamide and dimethylacetamide; nitriles such as acetonitrile; and dimethyl sulfoxide.<br>
The following are typical examples of the adjuvant, which are used depending upon purposes and used alone or in combination in some cases, or need not to be used at all.<br>

To improve the flowabililty of a solid product, there may be used adjuvants such as waxes, stearates and alkyl phosphates.<br>
Adjuvants such as naphthalenesulfonic acid condensation products and polycondensates of phosphates may be used as a peptiEer for dispersible products.<br>
Adjuvants such as silicon oils may also be used as a defoaming agent.<br>
The content of the active ingredient may be varied as required and may be chosen in a range of 0.01 to 80% by weight as an active ingredient.  In dusts or granules, the suitable content thereof is from 0.01 to 50% by weight.  In emulsifiable concentrates or flowable wettable powders, it is also from 0.01 to 50% by weight.<br>
The agricultural and horticultural insecticide of the present invention is used to control a variety of insect pests in the following manner.  That is, it is applied to a crop on which the insect pests are expected to appear or a site where the appearance of the insect pests is undesirable, as it is or after being properly diluted with or suspended inwater or the like, in an amount effec¬tive for control of the insect pests.<br><br>
The applying dosage of the agricultural and horticultural insecticide of the present invention is varied depending upon various factors such as a purpose, insect pests to be controlled, a growth state of a plant, tendency of insect pests appearance, weather, environmental conditions, a preparation form, an application method, an application site and an application time.  It may be properly chosen in a range of 0.1 g to 10 kg (in terms of the active ingredient) per 10 ares depending upon purposes.<br>
The agricultural and horticultural insecticide of the present invention may be used in admixture with other agricultural and horticultural disease or pest controllers, acaricides, nematicides, bioagrochemicals, etc.; and herbicides, plant growth regulators, manures, etc. depend¬ing upon scenes using the present agricultural and horti¬cultural insecticides, in order to expand both spectrum of controllable diseases and insect pest species and the period of time when effective applications are possible or to reduce the dosage.<br>
The agrohorticultural insecticide of the present invention may be applied to the plant seeds or the cultiva¬tion mediums for seeding such as soil to be seeded, the mat for raising seedlings, water, etc. by the method of application to rice nursery box, seed powdering, etc. or by the method of seed disinfection.  For controlling the pest insects generated on fruit trees, cereals, upland field for vegetables, etc., it is also possible to make a plant absorb the agrohorticultural agent of the present invention<br><br>
by a seed treatment such as powder coating, dipping, etc., irrigation into seedling-raising carrier such as seedling-raising vessel, planting hole, etc. or by treatment of the culture solution for water culture.<br>

To a suspension of 0.46 g of N-(4-heptafluoro-isopropyl-2-methylphenyl)-3-trifluoromethoxyphthalamic acid in 10 ml of toluene was added 0.51 g of trifluoroacetic anhydride, and a reaction was carried out at room tempera¬ture for 30 minutes.  After completion of the reaction, the solvent was distilled off under reduced pressure to obtain 0.49 g of a crude objective product.  The product thus obtained was used in the subsequent reaction without purification.<br>
(4-4) Production of N^-(4-heptafluoroisopropyl-2-methyl-phenyl )-B'-3-(l-methyl-2-methylthioethyl)-3-trifluoro-methoxyphthalamide (Compound No. 210)<br>
In 10 ml of acetonitrile was dissolved 0.44 g of N-(4-heptafluoroisopropyl-2-methylphenyl)-3-trifluoro-methoxyphthalisoiOLide.  Then, 0.10 g of l-methyl-2-raethyl-thioethylaniline and 0.01 g of trifluoroacetic acid were added to the solution obtained above, and reacted for 3 hours.  After completion of the reaction, the reaction solution was cooled to 0°C, the deposited crystal was collected by filtration, and washed with hexane.  Thus,<br><br>
0.46 g of the objective compound was obtained. Property: m.p. 184-185°C;  Yield: 77% Next, typical formulation examples of the present<br>

Test Example 1: Insecticidal effect on diamond back moth (Plutella xylostellal<br>
Adult diamondback moths were released and allowed to oviposit on a Chinese cabbage seedling.  Two days after the release, the seedling having the eggs deposited thereon was immersed for about 30 seconds in a liguid chemical prepared by diluting a preparation containing each compound listed in Table 1, 2 or 3 as an active ingredient to adjust the concentration to 50 ppm.  After air-dryness, it was allowed to stand in a room thermostatted at 25°C*  Six days after the immersion, the hatched insects were counted. The nortality was calculated according to the following sguation and the insecticidal effect was judged according to the criterion shown below.  The test was carried out<br><br><br>
A piece of cabbage leaf {cultivar; Shikidori) was immersed for about 30 seconds in a liquid chemical prepared oy  diluting a preparation containing each compound listed Ln Table 1, 2 or 3 as an active ingredient to adjust the concentration to 50 ppm. After air-dryness, it was placed Ln a plastic Petri dish with a diameter of 9 cm and Inoculated with second-instar larvae of common cutworm, ifter which the dish was closed and then allowed to stand .n a room thermostatted at 25°C.  Eight days after the .noculation, the dead and alive were counted.  The mortality was calculated according to the following equation and the insecticidal effect was judged according<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
