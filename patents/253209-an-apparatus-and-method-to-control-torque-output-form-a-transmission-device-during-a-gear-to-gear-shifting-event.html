APPARATUS AND METHOD TO CONTROL TRANSMISSION TORQUE<br>
OUTPUT DURING A GEAR-TO-GEAR SHIFT<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] This invention pertains generally to powertrain control systems for<br>
fuel/electric hybrid powertrain systems, and more specifically to powertrain<br>
control during transmission shifts.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Various hybrid powertrain architectures are known for managing the<br>
input and output torques of various torque-generative devices in hybrid<br>
vehicles, most commonly internal combustion engines and electric machines.<br>
One such hybrid powertrain architecture comprises a two-mode, compound-<br>
split, electro-mechanical transmission which utilizes an input member for<br>
receiving motive torque from a prime mover power source, typically an<br>
internal combustion engine, and an output member for delivering motive<br>
torque from the transmission to a driveline of the vehicle. First and second<br>
electrical machines are operatively connected to an electrical energy storage<br>
device for interchanging electrical power therebetween. The first and second<br>
electrical machines comprise motor/generators operable to transform the<br>
electrical power to motive torque for input to the transmission, independently<br>
of torque input from the internal combustion engine. The first and second<br>
electrical machines are further operable to transform vehicle kinetic energy,<br>
transmitted through the vehicle driveline, to electrical energy potential that is<br>
storable in the electrical energy storage device. A control unit is provided for<br>
regulating the electrical power interchange between the electrical energy<br>
storage device and the first and second electrical machines.<br>
[0003] Engineers implementing powertrain systems including transmissions<br>
are tasked with developing gear shifting schemes. Such transmission systems<br>
typically include devices able to operate in one of a plurality of fixed-gear<br><br>
2<br>
modes, wherein shifting between the fixed gears occurs in response to<br>
predetermined operating conditions, and often not involving an overt request<br>
for shift from a vehicle operator.<br>
[0004] In fixed gear operation, the internal combustion engine operates by<br>
providing an input speed and torque to the transmission device. The<br>
transmission input speed is equal to transmission output speed multiplied by<br>
the initial fixed gear ratio. When a shift is commanded, torque is off-loaded<br>
from a currently applied clutch. When an oncoming clutch is applied, the<br>
transmission input speed, coming from the internal combustion engine, needs<br>
to match the transmission output speed multiplied by the oncoming gear ratio.<br>
When the input speed from the engine does not match the transmission output<br>
speed multiplied by the oncoming gear ratio, driveline jerks, clutch slippage,<br>
and other problems leading to customer dissatisfaction occur. Furthermore,<br>
such actions as driveline jerks and clutch slippage may affect operating<br>
temperatures of the transmission clutches, and therefore clutch durability. On<br>
a hybrid powertrain system having a plurality of torque-generative devices,<br>
there are additional variables and degrees of freedom affecting operation of<br>
the powertrain which must be considered and managed during shift operation.<br>
[0005] Therefore, there is a need to for a method and apparatus to control<br>
powertrain operation during gear shifting events for a hybrid powertrain<br>
system, to address concerns mentioned hereinabove.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0006]    In order to address the concerns raised hereinabove, an article of<br>
manufacture is provided to effect a method to control torque output from a<br>
transmission device of an exemplary powertrain during a gear-to-gear shifting<br>
event when an off-going torque-transfer device is disengaged.<br>
[0007]    In accordance with the present invention, the exemplary powertrain<br>
system comprises a plurality of torque-generative devices each operable to<br>
supply motive torque to the transmission device and vehicle driveline, and the<br>
exemplary transmission device comprises a two-mode, compound-split, hybrid<br><br>
3<br>
electro-mechanical transmission having four fixed gear ratios. There is a<br>
plurality of gears operable to transmit torque between the transmission device<br>
and an output shaft using a plurality of torque-transfer devices. The torque-<br>
generative devices preferably comprise a pair of electrical machines and an<br>
internal combustion engine. Torque transmission can be in the form of<br>
transmitting motive torque from one of the torque-generative devices through<br>
the transmission to the vehicle driveline.<br>
[0008] An aspect of the invention includes the aforementioned article of<br>
manufacture comprising a storage medium having a computer program<br>
encoded therein for effecting the method, wherein the storage medium is<br>
integrated in an electronic control system. The method is preferably executed<br>
as a computer program in a distributed electronic control system which<br>
controls operation of the transmission. The method first comprises a<br>
predetermined preferred torque output from the transmission device. Torque<br>
output from each of a plurality of torque-generative devices operative to<br>
transmit motive torque to the transmission device is controlled during the shift.<br>
Torque transmitted across a selectively actuated torque transfer device is<br>
controlled preferably to substantially meet the predetermined preferred torque<br>
output from the transmission device.<br>
[0009] An aspect of the invention includes the transmission comprising a<br>
two-mode, compound-split, electro-mechanical transmission, wherein the<br>
torque-generative devices comprise electrical machines. The motive torque<br>
output from the electrical machines operative to transmit motive torque to the<br>
transmission device is limited based upon available battery power. The<br>
electrical machines are each operable to independently transmit motive torque<br>
to the transmission.<br>
[0010] Another aspect of the invention comprises the transmission device<br>
including four torque-transfer devices operative to control the transmission in<br>
operating ranges of at least four fixed-gear modes and two continuously<br>
variable modes.<br><br>
4<br>
[0011]   Another aspect of the  invention  includes the  torque-generative<br>
devices further comprising an internal combustion engine.<br>
[0012]   Another aspect of the invention includes the transmission operable to<br>
provide motive torque to a driveline of a vehicle.<br>
[0013] Another aspect of the invention includes the predetermined preferred<br>
torque output from the transmission device comprising a series of time-based<br>
values for output torque derived based upon operator expectations during a<br>
shifting event.<br>
[0014] Another aspect of the invention includes controlling actuation of the<br>
torque-transfer device based upon a temperature of the selectively actuated<br>
torque-transfer device during the shifting event. The temperature of the<br>
selectively actuated torque-transfer device during the shifting event is<br>
determined based upon a rotational speed of an input shaft to the transmission<br>
and an elapsed time to shift.<br>
[0015] Another aspect of the invention includes controlling actuation of the<br>
torque-transfer device based upon slippage of the selectively actuated torque-<br>
transfer device during the shifting event. This includes controlling torque<br>
transmitted across the selectively actuated torque transfer device based upon a<br>
temperature of the torque transfer device during the shift event.<br>
[0016] Another aspect of the invention includes determining the temperature<br>
of the torque transfer device during the shift event based upon rotation of an<br>
input shaft to the transmission and an elapsed time to shift.<br>
[0017] These and other aspects of the invention will become apparent to<br>
those skilled in the art upon reading and understanding the following detailed<br>
description of the embodiments.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0018] The invention may take physical form in certain parts and<br>
arrangement of parts, the preferred embodiment of which will be described in<br>
detail and illustrated in the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof,<br>
and wherein:<br><br>
5<br>
[0019] Fig. 1 is a schematic diagram of an exemplary powertrain, in<br>
accordance with the present invention;<br>
[0020]    Fig. 2 is a schematic diagram of an exemplary architecture for a<br>
controller and powertrain, in accordance with the present invention; and,<br>
[0021]    Figs. 3A, 3B, and 3C comprise exemplary data graphs, in accordance<br>
with the present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
[0022] Referring now to the drawings, wherein the showings are for the<br>
purpose of illustrating the invention only and not for the purpose of limiting<br>
the same, Figs. 1 and 2 show a system comprising an engine 14, transmission<br>
10, control system, and driveline which has been constructed in accordance<br>
with an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[0023] Mechanical aspects of exemplary transmission 10 are disclosed in<br>
detail in commonly assigned U.S. Patent Application Publication No. U.S.<br>
2005/0137042 Al, published June 23, 2005, entitled Two-Mode, Compound-<br>
Split, Hybrid Electro-Mechanical Transmission having Four Fixed Ratios,<br>
which is incorporated herein by reference. The exemplary two-mode,<br>
compound-split, electro-mechanical hybrid transmission embodying the<br>
concepts of the present invention is depicted in Fig. 1, and is designated<br>
generally by the numeral 10. The transmission 10 has an input shaft 12 that is<br>
preferably directly driven by an engine 14. A transient torque damper 20 is<br>
incorporated between the output shaft 18 of the engine 14 and the input<br>
member 12 of the transmission 10. The transient torque damper 20 preferably<br>
comprises a torque transfer device 77 having characteristics of a damping<br>
mechanism and a spring, shown respectively as 78 and 79. The transient<br>
torque damper 20 permits selective engagement of the engine 14 with the<br>
transmission 10, but it must be understood that the torque transfer device 77 is<br>
not utilized to change, or control, the mode in which the transmission 10<br>
operates. The torque transfer device 77 preferably comprises a hydraulically<br>
operated friction clutch, referred to as clutch C5.<br><br>
6<br>
[0024] The engine 14 may be any of numerous forms of internal combustion<br>
engines, such as a spark-ignition engine or a compression-ignition engine,<br>
readily adaptable to provide a power output to the transmission 10 at a range<br>
of operating speeds, from idle, at or near 600 revolutions per minute (RPM), to<br>
over 6,000 RPM. Irrespective of the means by which the engine 14 is<br>
connected to the input member 12 of the transmission 10, the input member 12<br>
is connected to a planetary gear set 24 in the transmission 10.<br>
[0025] Referring specifically now to Fig. 1, the transmission 10 utilizes three<br>
planetary-gear sets 24, 26 and 28. The first planetary gear set 24 has an outer<br>
ring gear member 30 which circumscribes an inner, or sun gear member 32. A<br>
plurality of planetary gear members 34 is rotatably mounted on a carrier 36<br>
such that each planetary gear member 34 meshingly engages both the outer<br>
gear member 30 and the inner gear member 32.<br>
[0026] The second planetary gear set 26 also has an outer ring gear member<br>
38, which circumscribes an inner sun gear member 40. A plurality of planetary<br>
gear members 42 is rotatably mounted on a carrier 44 such that each planetary<br>
gear 42 meshingly engages both the outer gear member 38 and the inner gear<br>
member 40.<br>
[0027] The third planetary gear set 28 also has an outer ring gear member<br>
46, which circumscribes an inner sun gear member 48. A plurality of planetary<br>
gear members 50 is rotatably mounted on a carrier 52 such that each planetary<br>
gear 50 meshingly engages both the outer gear member 46 and the inner gear<br>
member 48.<br>
[0028] The three planetary gear sets 24, 26 and 28 each comprise simple<br>
planetary gear sets. Furthermore, the first and second planetary gear sets 24<br>
and 26 are compounded in that the inner gear member 32 of the first planetary<br>
gear set 24 is conjoined through a hub plate gear 54 to the outer gear member<br>
38 of the second planetary gear set 26. The conjoined inner gear member 32 of<br>
the first planetary gear set 24 and the outer gear member 38 of the second<br>
planetary gear set 26 are connected to a first electrical machine comprising a<br>
motor/generator 56, also referred to as "MG-A".<br><br>
7<br>
[0029] The planetary gear sets 24 and 26 are further compounded in that the<br>
carrier 36 of the first planetary gear set 24 is conjoined through a shaft 60, to<br>
the carrier 44 of the second planetary gear set 26. As such, carriers 36 and 44<br>
of the first and second planetary gear sets 24 and 26, respectively, are<br>
conjoined. The shaft 60 is also selectively connected to the carrier 52 of the<br>
third planetary gear set 28, through a torque transfer device 62 which, as will<br>
be hereinafter more fully explained, is employed to assist in the selection of<br>
the operational modes of the transmission 10. The carrier 52 of the third<br>
planetary gear set 28 is connected directly to the transmission output member<br>
64.<br>
[0030] In the embodiment described herein, wherein the transmission 10 is<br>
used in a land vehicle, the output member 64 is operably connected to a<br>
driveline comprising a gear box 90 or other torque transfer device which<br>
provides a torque output to one or more vehicular axles 92 or half-shafts (not<br>
shown). The axles 92, in turn, terminate in drive members 96. The drive<br>
members 96 may be either front or rear wheels of the vehicle on which they<br>
are employed, or they may be a drive gear of a track vehicle. The drive<br>
members 96 may have some form of wheel brake 94 associated therewith.<br>
The drive members each have a speed parameter, NWHL, comprising rotational<br>
speed of each wheel 96 which is typically measurable with a wheel speed<br>
sensor.<br>
[0031] The inner gear member 40 of the second planetary gear set 26 is<br>
connected to the inner gear member 48 of the third planetary gear set 28,<br>
through a sleeve shaft 66 that circumscribes shaft 60. The outer gear member<br>
46 of the third planetary gear set 28 is selectively connected to ground,<br>
represented by the transmission housing 68, through a torque transfer device<br>
70. Torque transfer device 70, as is also hereinafter explained, is also<br>
employed to assist in the selection of the operational modes of the<br>
transmission 10. The sleeve shaft 66 is also connected to a second electrical<br>
machine comprising a motor/generator 72, referred to as MG-B.<br><br>
8<br>
[0032] All the planetary gear sets 24, 26 and 28 as well as MG-A and MG-B<br>
56 and 72 are coaxially oriented, as about the axially disposed shaft 60. MG-<br>
A and MG-B 56 and 72 are both of an annular configuration which permits<br>
them to circumscribe the three planetary gear sets 24, 26 and 28 such that the<br>
planetary gear sets 24, 26 and 28 are disposed radially inwardly of the MG-A<br>
and MG-B 56 and 72. A resolver 80 is attached to each of the MG-A and MG-<br>
B, as described hereinbelow.<br>
[0033] A torque transfer device C3 73 selectively connects the sun gear 40<br>
with ground, i.e., with transmission housing 68. A torque transfer device, i.e.<br>
C4 75 is operative as a lock-up clutch, locking planetary gear sets 24, 26, MG-<br>
A and MG-B 56, 72 and the input to rotate as a group, by selectively<br>
connecting the sun gear 40 with the carrier 44. The torque transfer devices 62,<br>
70, 73, 75 are all friction clutches, respectively referred to as follows: clutch<br>
Cl 70, clutch C2 62, clutch C3 73, and clutch C4 75. Each clutch is<br>
preferably hydraulically actuated, receiving pressurized hydraulic fluid from a<br>
pump when a corresponding clutch control solenoid is actuated. Hydraulic<br>
actuation of each of the clutches is accomplished using a known hydraulic<br>
fluid circuit having a plurality of clutch-control solenoids, which is not<br>
described in detail herein.<br>
[0034] The transmission 10 receives input motive torque from the torque-<br>
generative devices, including the engine 14 and the electrical machines 56<br>
and 72, as a result of energy conversion from fuel or electrical potential<br>
stored in an electrical energy storage device (ESD) 74. The ESD 74<br>
typically comprises one or more batteries. Other electrical energy and<br>
electrochemical energy storage devices that have the ability to store electric<br>
power and dispense electric power may be used in place of the batteries<br>
without altering the concepts of the present invention. The ESD 74 is<br>
preferably sized based upon factors including regenerative requirements,<br>
application issues related to typical road grade and temperature, and<br>
propulsion requirements such as emissions, power assist and electric range.<br>
The ESD 74 is high voltage DC-coupled to transmission power inverter<br><br>
9<br>
module (TPIM) 19 via DC lines or transfer conductors 27. The TPIM 19 is<br>
an element of the control system described hereinafter with regard to Fig. 2.<br>
The TPIM 19 communicates with the first electrical machine 56 by transfer<br>
conductors 29, and the TPIM 19 similarly communicates with the second<br>
electrical machine 72 by transfer conductors 31. Electrical current is<br>
transferable to or from the ESD 74 in accordance with whether the ESD 74<br>
is being charged or discharged. TPIM 19 includes the pair of power<br>
inverters and respective motor controllers configured to receive motor<br>
control commands and control inverter states therefrom for providing motor<br>
drive or regeneration functionality.<br>
[0035] In motoring control, the respective inverter receives current from<br>
the DC lines and provides AC current to the respective electrical machine,<br>
i.e. MG-A and MG-B, over transfer conductors 29 and 31. In regeneration<br>
control, the respective inverter receives AC current from the electrical<br>
machine over transfer conductors 29 and 31 and provides current to the DC<br>
lines 27. The net DC current provided to or from the inverters determines<br>
the charge or discharge operating mode of the electrical energy storage<br>
device 74. Preferably, MG-A 56 and MG-B 72 are three-phase AC<br>
machines and the inverters comprise complementary three-phase power<br>
electronics.<br>
[0036] Referring again to Fig. 1, a drive gear 80 may be presented from the<br>
input member 12. As depicted, the drive gear 80 fixedly connects the input<br>
member 12 to the outer gear member 30 of the first planetary gear set 24, and<br>
the drive gear 80, therefore, receives power from the engine 14 and/or the<br>
electrical machines 56 and/or 72 through planetary gear sets 24 and/or 26. The<br>
drive gear 80 meshingly engages an idler gear 82 which, in turn, meshingly<br>
engages a transfer gear 84 that is secured to one end of a shaft 86. The other<br>
end of the shaft 86 may be secured to a hydraulic/transmission fluid pump<br>
and/or power take-off ('PTO') unit, designated either individually or<br>
collectively at 88, and comprise an accessory load.<br><br>
10<br>
[0037] Referring now to Fig. 2, a schematic block diagram of the control<br>
system, comprising a distributed controller architecture, is shown. The<br>
elements described hereinafter comprise a subset of an overall vehicle control<br>
architecture, and are operable to provide coordinated system control of the<br>
powertrain system described herein. The control system is operable to<br>
synthesize pertinent information and inputs, and execute algorithms to control<br>
various actuators to achieve control targets, including such parameters as fuel<br>
economy, emissions, performance, driveability, and protection of hardware,<br>
including batteries of ESD 74 and MG-A and MG-B 56, 72. The distributed<br>
controller architecture includes engine control module ('ECM') 23,<br>
transmission control module ('TCM') 17, battery pack control module<br>
('BPCM') 21, and Transmission Power Inverter Module ('TPIM') 19. A<br>
hybrid control module ('HCP') 5 provides overarching control and<br>
coordination of the aforementioned controllers. There is a User Interface<br>
('UI') 13 operably connected to a plurality of devices through which a vehicle<br>
operator typically controls or directs operation of the powertrain, including the<br>
transmission 10. Exemplary vehicle operator inputs to the UI 13 include an<br>
accelerator pedal, a brake pedal, transmission gear selector, and, vehicle speed<br>
cruise control. Each of the aforementioned controllers communicates with<br>
other controllers, sensors, and actuators via a local area network ('LAN') bus<br>
6. The LAN bus 6 allows for structured communication of control parameters<br>
and commands between the various controllers. The specific communication<br>
protocol utilized is application-specific. By way of example, one<br>
communications protocol is the Society of Automotive Engineers standard<br>
J1939. The LAN bus and appropriate protocols provide for robust messaging<br>
and multi-controller interfacing between the aforementioned controllers, and<br>
other controllers providing functionality such as antilock brakes, traction<br>
control, and vehicle stability.<br>
[0038] The HCP 5 provides overarching control of the hybrid powertrain<br>
system, serving to coordinate operation of the ECM 23, TCM 17, TPIM 19,<br>
and BPCM 21.   Based upon various input signals from the UI 13 and the<br><br>
11<br>
powertrain, including the battery pack, the HCP 5 generates various<br>
commands, including: an engine torque command, clutch torque commands,<br>
TCL_N for the various clutches Cl, C2, C3, C4 of the transmission 10; and<br>
motor torque commands, TAand TB, for MG-A and MG-B, respectively.<br>
[0039] The ECM 23 is operably connected to the engine 14, and functions to<br>
acquire data from a variety of sensors and control a variety of actuators,<br>
respectively, of the engine 14 over a plurality of discrete lines collectively<br>
shown as aggregate line 35. The ECM 23 receives the engine torque<br>
command, TECMD, from the HCP 5, and generates a desired axle torque, and<br>
an indication of actual engine torque, Tl input to the transmission, which is<br>
communicated to the HCP 5. For simplicity, ECM 23 is shown generally<br>
having bi-directional interface with engine 14 via aggregate line 35. Various<br>
other parameters that may be sensed by ECM 23 include engine coolant<br>
temperature, engine input speed (Ni) to shaft 12 leading to the transmission,<br>
manifold pressure, ambient air temperature, and ambient pressure. Various<br>
actuators that may be controlled by the ECM 23 include fuel injectors, ignition<br>
modules, and throttle control modules.<br>
[0040] The TCM 17 is operably connected to the transmission 10 and<br>
functions to acquire data from a variety of sensors and provide command<br>
signals to the transmission. Inputs from the TCM 17 to the HCP 5 include<br>
estimated clutch torques, TCL_N_EST, for each of the clutches Cl, C2, C3, and,<br>
C4 and rotational speed, No, of the output shaft 64. Other actuators and<br>
sensors may be used to provide additional information from the TCM to the<br>
HCP for control purposes.<br>
[0041] The BPCM 21 is signally connected one or more sensors operable to<br>
monitor electrical current or voltage parameters of the ESD 74 to provide<br>
information about the state of the batteries to the HCP 5. Such information<br>
includes battery state-of-charge, battery voltage, VBAT, and available battery<br>
power, PBAT_MIN and PBAT_MAX.<br>
[0042] The Transmission Power Inverter Module (TPIM) 19 includes a<br>
pair of power inverters and motor controllers configured to receive motor<br><br>
12<br>
control commands and control inverter states therefrom to provide motor<br>
drive or regeneration functionality. The TPIM 19 is operable to generate<br>
torque commands for MG-A 56 and MG-B 72, TA and TB, based upon input<br>
from the HCP 5, which is driven by operator input through Ul 13 and<br>
system operating parameters. The motor torque commands for MG-A and<br>
MG-B, i.e. TA and TB, are implemented by the control system, including the<br>
TPIM 19, to control MG-A and MG-B. Individual motor speed signals, NA<br>
and NB for MG-A and MG-B respectively, are derived by the TPIM 19 from<br>
the motor phase information or conventional rotation sensors. The TPIM 19<br>
determines and communicates motor speeds, NAand NB, to the HCP 5. The<br>
electrical energy storage device 74 is high-voltage DC-coupled to the TPIM<br>
19 via DC lines 27. Electrical current is transferable to or from the TPIM<br>
19 in accordance with whether the ESD 74 is being charged or discharged.<br>
[0043] Each of the aforementioned controllers is preferably a general-<br>
purpose digital computer generally comprising a microprocessor or central<br>
processing unit, storage mediums comprising read only memory (ROM),<br>
random access memory (RAM), electrically programmable read only memory<br>
(EPROM), high speed clock, analog to digital (A/D) and digital to analog<br>
(D/A) circuitry, and input/output circuitry and devices (I/O) and appropriate<br>
signal conditioning and buffer circuitry. Each controller has a set of control<br>
algorithms, comprising resident program instructions and calibrations stored in<br>
ROM and executed to provide the respective functions of each computer.<br>
Information transfer between the various computers is preferably<br>
accomplished using the aforementioned LAN 6.<br>
[0044] Algorithms for control and state estimation in each of the controllers<br>
are typically executed during preset loop cycles such that each algorithm is<br>
executed at least once each loop cycle. Algorithms stored in the non-volatile<br>
memory devices are executed by one of the central processing units and are<br>
operable to monitor inputs from the sensing devices and execute control and<br>
diagnostic routines to control operation of the respective device, using preset<br>
calibrations.    Loop cycles are typically executed at regular intervals, for<br><br>
13<br>
example each 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25 and 100 milliseconds during ongoing<br>
engine and vehicle operation. Alternatively, algorithms may be executed in<br>
response to occurrence of an event.<br>
[0045] In response to an operator's action, as captured by the UI 13, the<br>
supervisory HCP controller 5 and one or more of the other controllers<br>
determine required transmission output torque, To at shaft 64. Selectively<br>
operated components of the transmission 10 are appropriately controlled and<br>
manipulated to respond to the operator demand. For example, in the<br>
exemplary embodiment shown in Fig. 1 and 2, when the operator has selected<br>
a forward drive range and manipulates either the accelerator pedal or the brake<br>
pedal, the HCP 5 determines an output torque for the transmission, To, which<br>
affects how and when the vehicle accelerates or decelerates. Final vehicle<br>
acceleration is affected by other factors, including, e.g., road load, road grade,<br>
and vehicle mass. The HCP 5 monitors the parametric states of the torque-<br>
generative devices, and determines the output of the transmission required to<br>
arrive at the desired torque output. Under the direction of the HCP 5, the<br>
transmission 10 operates over a range of output speeds from slow to fast in<br>
order to meet the operator demand.<br>
[0046]    The two-mode,  compound-split,  electro-mechanical transmission,<br>
includes output member 64 which receives output power through two distinct<br>
gear trains within the transmission 10, and operates in several transmission<br>
operating modes, described with reference now to Fig. 1, and Table 1, below.<br>
Table 1<br>
Transmission Operating Mode                     Actuated Clutches<br>
Mode l                                                           Cl 70<br>
Fixed Ratio (GR1)                                       Cl 70             C4 75<br>
Fixed Ratio (GR2)                                        Cl 70             C2 62<br>
Mode II                                                          C2 62<br>
Fixed Ratio (GR3)                                        C2 62             C4 75<br>
Fixed Ratio (GR4)                                        C2 62             C3 73<br><br>
14<br>
[0047] The various transmission operating modes described in the table<br>
indicate which of the specific clutches Cl, C2, C3, C4 are engaged or actuated<br>
for each of the operating modes. Additionally, in various transmission<br>
operating modes, MG-A and MG-B may each operate as electrical motors to<br>
generate motive torque, or as a generator to generate electrical energy. A first<br>
mode, or gear train, is selected when the torque transfer device 70 is actuated<br>
in order to "ground" the outer gear member 46 of the third planetary gear set<br>
28. A second mode, or gear train, is selected when the torque transfer device<br>
70 is released and the torque transfer device 62 is simultaneously actuated to<br>
connect the shaft 60 to the carrier 52 of the third planetary gear set 28. Other<br>
factors outside the scope of the invention affect when MG-A and MG-B 56, 72<br>
operate as motors and generators, and are not discussed herein.<br>
[0048] The control system, shown primarily in Fig. 2, is operable to provide<br>
a range of transmission output speeds, No, of shaft 64 from relatively slow to<br>
relatively fast within each mode of operation. The combination of two modes<br>
with a slow-to-fast output speed range in each mode allows the transmission<br>
10 to propel a vehicle from a stationary condition to highway speeds, and meet<br>
various other requirements as previously described. Additionally, the control<br>
system coordinates operation of the transmission 10 so as to allow<br>
synchronized shifts between the modes.<br>
[0049] The first and second modes of operation refer to circumstances in<br>
which the transmission functions are controlled by one clutch, i.e. either clutch<br>
Cl 62 or C2 70, and by the controlled speed and torque of machines MG-A<br>
and MG-B 56 and 72, which can be referred to as a continuously variable<br>
transmission mode. Certain ranges of operation are described below in which<br>
fixed ratios are achieved by applying an additional clutch. This additional<br>
clutch may be clutch C3 73 or C4 75, as shown in the table, above.<br>
[0050] When the additional clutch is applied, fixed ratio of input-to-output<br>
speed of the transmission, i.e. NI/N0, is achieved. The rotations of machines<br>
MG-A and MG-B 56, 72 are dependent on internal rotation of the mechanism<br>
as defined by the clutching and proportional to the input speed, NI determined<br><br>
15<br>
or measured at shaft 12. The machines MG-A and MG-B operate as motors or<br>
generators. They are completely independent of engine to output power flow,<br>
thereby enabling both to be motors, both to function as generators, or any<br>
combination thereof. This allows, for instance, during operation in Fixed Ratio<br>
1 that motive power output from the transmission at shaft 64 is provided by<br>
power from the engine and power from MG-A and MG-B, through planetary<br>
gear set 28 by accepting power from the energy storage device 74.<br>
[0051] The transmission operating mode can be switched between Fixed<br>
Ratio operation and continuously variable Mode operation by activating or<br>
deactivating one the additional clutches during Mode I or Mode II operation.<br>
Determination of operation in fixed ratio mode or continuously variable mode<br>
is by algorithms executed by the control system, and is outside the scope of<br>
this invention.<br>
[0052] The modes of operation may overlap the ratio of operation, and<br>
selection depends again on the driver's input and response of the vehicle to<br>
that input. RANGE 1 falls primarily within mode I operation when clutches<br>
Cl 70 and C4 75 are engaged. RANGE 2 falls within mode I and mode II<br>
when clutches C2 62 and Cl 70 are engaged. A third fixed ratio range is<br>
available primarily during mode II when clutches C2 62 and C4 75 are<br>
engaged, and a fourth fixed ratio range is available during mode II when<br>
clutches C2 62 and C3 73 are engaged. It is notable that ranges of operation<br>
for Mode I and Mode II typically overlap significantly.<br>
[0053] Output of the exemplary powertrain system described hereinabove is<br>
constrained due to mechanical and system limitations. The output speed, No,<br>
of the transmission measured at shaft 64 is limited due to limitations of engine<br>
output speed, NE, measured at shaft 18, and transmission input speed, Nl<br>
measured at shaft 12, and speed limitations of the MG-A and MG-B,<br>
designated as +/- NA, +/- NB. Output torque, To, of the transmission 64 is<br>
similarly limited due to limitations of the engine input torque, TE, and input<br>
torque, Tl, measured at shaft 12 after the transient torque damper 20,   and<br><br>
16<br>
torque limitations (TA_MAx, TA_MIN, TB_MAX, TB_MIN) of MG-A and MG-B 56,<br>
72.<br>
[0054] In operation, a shift occurs in the exemplary transmission due to a<br>
change in operator demand for output torque, typically communicated through<br>
inputs to the UI 13, including the accelerator pedal, the brake pedal, the<br>
transmission gear selector, and, the vehicle speed cruise control system.<br>
Additionally, a change in demand for output torque may be predicated on a<br>
change in external conditions, including, e.g. changes in road grade, road<br>
surface conditions, or wind load. Furthermore, a change in demand for output<br>
torque may be predicated on a change in powertrain torque demand caused by<br>
a controller command to change one of the electrical machines between<br>
electrical energy generating mode and torque generating mode. The<br>
distributed control architecture acts in concert to determine a need for a<br>
change in transmission operating gear, and executes the forgoing to effect the<br>
change in gear.<br>
[0055] Referring now to Fig. 3, a graphical depiction of an element of a<br>
fixed gear-to-fixed gear shifting event is now described, comprising<br>
controlling operation of various machines and actuators of the aforementioned<br>
powertrain system. Referring specifically to Fig. 3A, graphs of input speed,<br>
N1, as a function of time, are shown for operation of the exemplary powertrain<br>
system. Line A comprises a depiction of input speed, N1, showing a<br>
relationship with transmission output, No, multiplied by the first gear ratio,<br>
GR1, previously described with reference to Table 1. Line B comprises a<br>
depiction of input speed, NI; showing a relationship with transmission output,<br>
No, multiplied by the second gear ratio, GR2, also previously described with<br>
reference to Table 1. Line C comprises a depiction of input speed, N1 during a<br>
shift event, wherein there is a controlled transition from operation in. the first<br>
gear ratio GR1 to operation in the second gear ratio GR2, beginning at time<br>
point 110 and ending at time point 120.<br>
[0056] Referring specifically to Fig. 3B, a profile of a change in input speed,<br>
N1_dot during the shift transition operation is shown, wherein there are three<br><br>
17<br>
distinct regions of operation of changes in the input speed,N1_dot. The three<br>
regions of operation preferably comprise: Region D, wherein N,_dot is<br>
decreasing, indicating a deceleration of the engine input to the transmission;<br>
Region E, wherein Nldot is a constant value; and, Region F, wherein N1_dot<br>
is increasing, indicating an acceleration of the engine input to the<br>
transmission. The profile for N1dot is preferably a predetermined profile<br>
which is stored in the control system and executed to control operation of the<br>
engine during the shift event.<br>
[0057] Referring specifically to Fig. 3C, a plurality of torque output graphs<br>
are depicted during the shift from the first fixed gear (shown herein for GR1)<br>
to the second fixed gear (shown herein for GR2). Line G comprises a torque<br>
profile comprising an idealized linear time-based interpolation of output<br>
torque between GR1 and GR2, wherein there is no consideration for system<br>
momentums and inertias, and restraints on outputs of the torque-generative<br>
devices. Line H comprises a torque profile for output torque based upon<br>
maximum torque-generating capabilities of the electric machines, MG-A 56<br>
and MG-B 72, as further restrained by the output of the battery pack or ESD<br>
74. Line H does not include torque generation by an oncoming clutch, in this<br>
case clutch C2. Line I comprises a calibrated time-based value of output<br>
torque To, which is derived based upon operator expectations for torque output<br>
to vehicle driveline during a shifting event. Line I is a predetermined profile<br>
for torque output from the transmission, preferably to shaft 64, stored in one of<br>
the control modules of the control system. The torque output is necessarily<br>
limited based upon torque-generative capacity of the system, including<br>
operating limits of the oncoming clutch, in this case C2.<br>
[0058] The operating limits of the oncoming clutch are driven primarily by a<br>
limit on clutch energy. Clutch energy is driven by an increase in clutch<br>
temperature caused by clutch slippage, as is described hereinafter. Line J<br>
comprises a maximum executed torque output for operating the transmission,<br>
preferably derived based upon all of the aforementioned constraints, Including<br>
the profile of change in input speed, N1_dot, the idealized linear time-based<br><br>
18<br>
interpolation of the output torque, To, between GR1 and GR2, the output<br>
torque based upon maximum torque-generating capabilities of the electric<br>
machines, the calibrated time-based value of the output torque To, which is<br>
derived based upon operator expectations for torque output, and the operating<br>
limits of the oncoming clutch. This operation is described herein.<br>
[0059] The relationships described with regard to Fig. 3 can be described<br>
mathematically, which can then be reduced to algorithms executable in the<br>
control system described above. A governing equation is shown below, in Eq.<br>
1:<br>
[0060]   wherein:<br>
[0061]   T1 and  To are   input  and  output  torques  of the  transmission,<br>
respectively;<br>
[0062]   TA and TB are output torques of MG-A and MG-B, respectively;<br>
[0063]   Tc_ON is torque of the oncoming clutch, e.g. C2 for G2 in this<br>
example; and<br>
[0064]   C11, C12, C21, C22, D11, D12, D21, D22, KI, and Ko comprise<br>
experimentally derived scalar values.<br>
[0065]   Eq. 1 is reduceable to:<br><br>
[0066]                             <br><br>
[0067]    wherein:<br>
[0068]    T1M, T0M represent the input and output motor torques,<br>
[0069]    T,N, T0N represent input and output transmission torques; and,<br>
[0070]    T1C and T0C represent the oncoming clutch torques.<br>
[0071]    Eq. 2 is reduceable to:<br>
[0073]   An important practical significance of the values for Eq. 3 includes<br>
that a maximum value for the ToX factor is represented by Line H of Fig. 3C.<br><br><br><br><br>
19<br>
[0074] Referring again to Fig. 3 and Eqs. 1, 2, and 3, the value for N^dot is<br>
a known calibration, and No_dot is a readily measurable value, measured at<br>
output shaft 64. Values for TA and TB are known, measured values by<br>
measuring current through the TPIM to each of MG-A and MG-B. Therefore,<br>
a range of needed values for oncoming clutch torque, TC_ON is determinable<br>
and calculable.<br>
[0075] Once the range of needed values for oncoming clutch torque, Tc_0N is<br>
determined, the limitations based upon clutch torque energy can be derived,<br>
resulting in the desired output torque shown with reference again to Line I of<br>
Fig. 3C. The operating limits of the oncoming clutch, in this case C2 are<br>
determined as follows, driven primarily by a limit on clutch energy, due to an<br>
increase in clutch temperature caused by clutch slippage. This determination<br>
of allowable energy is now described by way of example. The exemplary<br>
clutch, C2, has a maximum allowable operating temperature range from 80 C<br>
to 250 C, over an associated thermal capacity of 20 kilojoules (kJ). Clutch<br>
temperature can be estimated based upon operating temperature of the<br>
transmission and other factors. It is estimated, for sake of calculation, as 150<br>
C in this instance, which means the remaining clutch energy is 20 * (100/170)<br>
or about 12 kJ. It is assumed that a shift event requires an elapsed time of one<br>
half second, or 500 milliseconds. During the elapsed time in which the shift<br>
event occurs, clutch slippage is determined based upon the N1dot profile, and<br>
the output speed and oncoming gear ratio, N0*GR2. Using known<br>
relationships between power, energy, and time, it can be readily determined<br>
that clutch energy, in the form of slippage and clutch friction, must not exceed<br>
a maximum value of 160 N-m in this example in order to maintain physical<br>
integrity of the clutch device. The oncoming clutch torque, Tc-on, can be<br>
determined based thereupon.<br>
[0076] It is understood that application-specific masses, inertias, friction<br>
factors, and other characteristics and parameters of the driveline affect various<br>
powertrain and driveline operating states, and therefore the response times and<br><br>
20<br>
magnitudes are intended to be exemplary, while still descriptive of the overall<br>
operation of the powertrain system.<br>
[0077] As previously described, the transmission device 10 comprises a<br>
plurality of gears and torque-transfer devices operable to transmit torque<br>
between the torque-generative devices 14, 56, 72 and the output shaft 64 and<br>
drive wheels 96 of the driveline. Torque transmission may comprise transfer<br>
of motive torque from one or more of the torque-generative devices 14, 56, 72<br>
to the driveline. Torque transmission may comprise transfer of torque from<br>
the drive wheels 96 via the driveline and transmission to one or more of the<br>
torque-generative devices 14, 56, 72 as a result of a process commonly<br>
referred to as engine-braking. In this configuration, engine-braking comprises<br>
transmitting at least a portion of driveline torque resulting from vehicle<br>
momentum from the output shaft 64 through torque-transfer devices, i.e.,<br>
clutches Cl, C2, C3, C4, to the torque-generative devices 14, 56, 72. The<br>
transmitted torque is absorbed by the powertrain in the form of electrical<br>
energy generation through MG-A and MG-B, and, engine braking through the<br>
internal combustion engine 14.<br>
[0078] It is understood that modifications in the transmission hardware are<br>
allowable within the scope of the invention. The invention has been described<br>
with specific reference to the preferred embodiments and modifications<br>
thereto. Further modifications and alterations may occur to others upon<br>
reading and understanding the specification. It is intended to include all such<br>
modifications and alterations insofar as they come within the scope of the<br>
invention.<br><br>

20.        The method of claim 19, wherein controlling torque output from each<br>
of the plurality of torque-generative devices operative to transmit motive<br>
torque to the transmission device further comprises limiting torque output<br>
from each of the torque-generative devices based upon available battery power<br>
5     when the torque-generative devices comprise electrical machines.<br>
21.        The method of claim 20, wherein controlling torque transmitted across<br>
the selectively actuated torque transfer device further comprises controlling<br>
actuation of the torque transfer device based upon a temperature of the torque<br>
transfer device during the shift event.<br><br>
25<br>
22. The method of claim 21, further comprising determining the<br>
temperature of the torque transfer device during the shift event based upon<br>
rotation of an input shaft to the transmission and an elapsed time to shift.<br><br>
A control system is provided to effect a method to control torque output from a two-mode, compound-split, electro-mechanical transmission during gear-to-gear shifting event when an off-going torque-transfer device is disengaged. It includes a computer program which controls transmission operation. A predetermined preferred torque output from the transmission device is determined. Torque output from torque-generative devices device is controlled. Torque transmitted across a selectively actuated torque transfer device is controlled, and limited based upon available battery power. Actuation of the oncoming torque-transfer device is preferably based upon a temperature of the device during the shifting event. The temperature during the shifting event is determined based upon a rotational speed of an input shaft to the transmission and an elapsed time to shift.</td>
