				<td>BACKGROUND<br>
The disclosures herein relate generally to mobile electronic commerce, and more particularly to a method for facilitating a wireless transaction and a system for carrying out such method.<br>
Mobile e-commerce is expected to grow at a tremendous rate. The sheer scale of the opportunity is impressive. The number of Internet-enabled mobile devices is expected to exceed the number of PCs by 2003. It is predicted that by 2004 the majority of e-commerce purchases will be made though wireless communication devices.<br>
With the convergence of location information and wireless access to the Internet, users of wireless communication devices will be able to receive product offerings relevant to their location and interests. This will open up a whole new method for targeting customers with advertising. A key area of interest in wireless e-commerce is the communication of targeted ads to the wireless devices. However, to take full advantage of wireless e-commerce, users will need to be in a position to act on such advertisements in a real time manner. This will require that transactions to be made using a wireless communication device in concert with receiving an advertisement for a product or service.<br>
There are several barriers, however, that must be overcome to make such wireless e-commerce transactions commonplace. One such barrier to wireless transactions being widely accepted is security. For wireless transactions to be embraced, systems must be in place for preventing unauthorized purchases on a user's wireless account. Such security measures are even more important in the case of a wifeless communication device, due to situations such as the wireless communication device being lost or stolen. Because wireless communication devices are significantly less secure than non-portable communication devices, steps must be taken to provide an elevated degree of security.<br>
However, present e-commerce security solutions are limited in their ability to provide effective and efficient solutions for facilitating secured wireless e-commerce transactions.<br>
However, present e-commerce security solutions are limited in their ability to provide effective and efficient solutions for facilitating secured wireless e-commerce transactions.<br>
Another barrier that must be overcome to make wireless e-commerce transactions commonplace is tying e-commerce transactions to"real world"products and services. For example, if an authorized user of a wireless communication device purchases a movie ticket for a show at a particular theater using her wireless communication device, systems must be in place for notifying the theater that the ticket has been purchased by an authorized user. Furthermore, systems must be in place for permitting the authorized user of the wireless communication device to obtain entry to the theater and the show once at the theater.<br>
Present solutions for tying e-commerce transactions to real world products are inconvenient and time-consuming. As a result, they offset much of the convenience of facilitating a wireless e-commerce transaction. For example, one present solution for tying an e-commerce transaction to a corresponding real word product requires that a printed confirmation, such as a receipt, pass or ticket, be printed out on a printer. Such a solution requires that the printed confirmation be generated at a physical location. The printed confirmations often include non-standardized barcodes that are processed at the merchant's location. Typically, the printed confirmation needs to be generated at a location different than the location where the wireless e-commerce transaction is performed.<br>
Accordingly, what is needed is a method for enabling wireless e-commerce transactions to be facilitated and fulfilled in a secure and convenient manner.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
One embodiment of a method for facilitating a wireless transaction includes receiving, by a wireless communication device, a first transaction code and displaying the first transaction code on a visual display of the wireless communication device.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
An embodiment of a method for facilitating a wireless transaction is illustrated in Fig. 1. At a box 100, the method includes an operation of facilitating a requester authenticated transaction request. At a box 200, the method includes an operation of facilitating wireless communication device enabled transaction fulfillment.<br>
By wireless transaction, it is meant that the transaction is requested and fulfilled through the use of a wireless communication device. By wireless communication device enabled transaction fulfillment, it is meant that the wireless communication device is used for facilitating fulfillment of the actual products or services requested. Internet enabled wireless telephones, Internet enabled wireless personal digital assistants (wPDA's) and wireless enabled laptop computers illustrate examples of suitable wireless communication devices capable of connecting with and communicating through a computer network system, such as the Internet. Broadly speaking, the wireless communication devices discussed herein are wireless communication devices capable of accessing a public computer network, a private computer network or both.<br>
As described below in greater detail, an apparatus for facilitating the methods and operations disclosed herein may include functional systems, such as a transaction management system and a transaction fulfillment system. The transaction requester utilizes a wireless communication device for communicating information to and from the transaction management system and the transaction fulfillment system.<br>
Two or more of the functional systems of the apparatus, such as the transaction management system and the transaction fulfillment system, may be located at a remote location from each other. However, in some applications, it may be advantageous for the functional systems to be located at the same physical location. In<br>
these applications, it may also be advantageous for a single integrated hardware system comprising the transaction management system and the transaction fulfillment system.<br>
The portability of wireless communication devices requires that sufficient security measures be in place to insure that the transaction requester is an authorized user of the wireless communication device. The intent of such security measures is to insure that an unauthorized user of the wireless communication device cannot facilitate a transaction using the wireless communication device. Accordingly, it is advantageous that the method for facilitating the wireless transaction includes an operation for verifying that the transaction requester is an authorized user of the wireless communication device.<br>
An embodiment of a method for performing the operation of facilitating the requester authenticated transaction request, the box 100 in Fig. 1, is illustrated in Fig. 2.<br>
At a box 102, the method includes receiving, at the transaction management system, a transaction request from a wired or a wireless communication device of a transaction requester. At a box 104, the identity of the transaction requester is authenticated. At a box 106, a first transaction barcode (FTB) is communicated to the wireless communication device. Depending on the configuration of the system architecture employed for carrying out the method 100, the FTB may be communicated from the transaction management system or the transaction fulfillment system.<br>
The FTB illustrates a first example of an optically scannable transaction code used to facilitate fulfillment of the transaction request. In subsequent operations disclosed herein, the FTB is displayed on a visual display of the wireless communication device for being optically scanned by a component of the transaction fulfillment system for enabling full or partial fulfillment of the transaction request.<br>
Voice authentication illustrates one example of a suitable technique for performing the operation of verifying the identity of the transaction requester at the box 104. A method for performing the operation of voice authentication of the transaction requester includes receiving, at a box 104a, a spoken transaction requester authentication code. It is contemplated that the spoken authentication code can be received from a wired telephone or the wireless communication device. At a box<br>
104b, an operation of comparing the spoken transaction requester authentication code is performed. At a box 104c, an operation is performed for determining a match between the spoken transaction requester authentication code and an authentic voice print for an authorized user of the wireless communication device.<br>
An example of voice authentication includes the user of a wireless phone calling into a secure server and speaking their phone number. The spoken telephone number illustrates an example of the spoken transaction requester authentication code. The spoken telephone number is then compared to an authentic voice print of an authorized user of the wireless communication device. If the spoken transaction requester authentication code matches the authentic voice print, the transaction requester is permitted to continue with fulfillment of the transaction.<br>
An embodiment of a method for performing the operation of facilitating wireless communication device enabled transaction fulfillment, the box 200 in Fig. 1, is illustrated in Fig. 3A. The method for the embodiment illustrated in Fig. 3A is best suite for being facilitated by a system in which verification of transaction codes is performed at the transaction management system. At a box 201, the FTB is received by the wireless communication device. At a box 202, the FTB is scanned from the wireless communication device. At a box 204, the FTB is verified. Verifying the FTB includes decoding the scanned FTB at a box 204a, communicating the decoded FTB to the transaction management system at a box 204b and correlating the decoded FTB to a first transaction fulfillment event at a box 204c. At a box 206, the first transaction fulfillment event is performed.<br>
At a box 208, a second transaction barcode (STB) is received by the wireless communication device. At a box 210, the STB is scanned from the wireless communication device. At a box 212, the STB is verified. Verifying the STB includes decoding the scanned STB at a box 212a, communicating the decoded STB to the transaction management system at a box 212b and correlating the decoded STB to a first transaction fulfillment event at a box 212c. At a box 214, the second transaction fulfillment event is performed.<br>
The first and second fulfillment events may be physical events or informational events. Activating a turnstile at a movie theater illustrates an example of a physical event.<br>
Communicating directions to a hotel illustrates an example of an informational event.<br>
Another embodiment of a method for performing the operation of facilitating wireless communication device enabled transaction fulfillment, the box 200 in Fig. 1, is illustrated in Fig. 3B. The method illustrated in Fig. 3B is best suited for being facilitated by a system in which verification of transaction codes is performed at the transaction fulfillment system. At a box 201', the FTB is received by the wireless communication device. At a box 202', the FTB is scanned from the wireless communication device. At a box 204', the FTB is verified. Verifying the FTB includes decoding the scanned FTB at a box 204a', correlating the decoded FTB to a first transaction fulfillment event at a box 204b'and communicating a first fulfillment verification (FFV) to the transaction management system at a box 204c. Fulfillment verifications may be used by the transaction management system for coordinating operations, such as removing the requested transaction from a list of available transactions. At a box 206, the first transaction fulfillment event is performed.<br>
At a box 208', a second transaction barcode (STB) is received by the wireless communication device. At a box 210', the STB is scanned from the wireless communication device. At a box 212, the STB is verified. Verifying the STB includes decoding the scanned STB at a box 212a', correlating the decoded STB to a first transaction fulfillment event at a box 212b'and communicating a second fulfillment verification (SPV) to the transaction management system at a box 212c'. At a box 214', the second transaction fulfillment event is performed.<br>
An embodiment of a transaction apparatus 300 for carrying out the methods of Figs. 1-3B using a telephonic type wireless communication device is illustrated in Fig. 4.<br>
The transaction apparatus 300 includes a transaction management system 302 coupled to a transaction fulfillment system 304 and an client system 305. It is also contemplated that in some applications it may be advantageous for the client computer system to be omitted from or discrete from the transaction apparatus 300. The transaction management system 302 is coupled to the transaction fulfillment system 304 through a computer network system 306. A wireless communication device 308 is coupled to the transaction management system 302 and to the transaction fulfillment system 304 through a telecommunications network system 310. A transaction requester 312 utilizes the wireless communication device 308 for<br>
communicating with the transaction management system 302 and the transaction fulfillment system 304.<br>
A transport control PROTOCOL/INTERNET protocol (TCP/IP) computer network system illustrates an example of the computer network system 306. A suitable TCP/IP computer network system is a global computer network such as the Internet.<br>
The telecommunications network system 310 includes a wireless telecommunications network and a wired telecommunications network. The telecommunication network system 310 enables communication of voice and data information to and from the transaction management system 302 and the transaction fulfillment system 304. The telecommunications networks of Sprint, AT&amp;T, and Southwestern Bell illustrate examples of the telecommunication network system 310.<br>
The transaction management system 302 includes a central processing unit (CPU) 302a, an information storage device 302b, a network interface system 302c, speech services module 302d and barcode software 302e. A network server or a workstation comprise the CPU302a. A Dell POWEREDGE series server illustrates an example of a suitable commercially available network server. A Dell PRECISIONTM series workstation illustrates an example of a suitable commercially available workstation.<br>

Fulfillment information, barcode information and authentic voice prints illustrate examples of information retrieved from the information storage device 302b.<br>
The network interface system 302c is coupled to the CPU 302a for facilitating the communication of information between the transaction management system 302, the computer network system 306 and the wireless communication device 308. A suitable network interface system includes a router such as, for example, a Cisco Systems 7200 series unit coupled to a data service UNIT/CHANNEL service unit (hereinafter referred to as a DSU/CSU) such as, for example, an ADC Kentrox D-Serv (TM) series unit.<br>
The speech services module 302d enables communication of voice signals between the wireless communication device 308 and the transaction management system 302. The speech services module 302d includes components such as hardware and software for enabling voice authentication.<br>
Voice authentication is a desirable technique for verifying the identity of the transaction requester. Wireless communication devices are not well suited for entering alpha information. Spoken authentication codes can be effectively and conveniently communicated from a wireless communication device such as a wireless telephone.<br>
Accordingly, the use of voice authentication reduces the difficulty in submitting identity verification information.<br>
Voice authentication technologies are commercially available from a number of sources. One example of a suitable voice authentication is Nuance Verifier 2.0 offered by Nuance Communications. Nuance Verifier is tightly integrated with Nuance 7.0 speech recognition software to ensure an exceptional level of user convenience and security. Users are recognized and authenticated simultaneously, shortening overall call duration, and eliminating the need for users to remember personal identification numbers and passwords.<br>
The tight integration of voice authentication and speech recognition technologies enables Nuance Verifier 2.0 to take advantage of unique distributed architecture associated with the Nuance platform. This architecture supports simultaneous load balancing of speech recognition, natural language understanding, voice authentication, and text-to- speech resources. It ensures optimal usage of every server CPU in the network, thus minimizing the amount of hardware required, and the associated cost, for a given speech system.<br>
SpeakEZ voice print speaker verification software offered by T-Netix Incorporated illustrates another example of voice authentication software. Smart Tone Technologies Incorporated offers proprietary software for enabling positive voice identification over wired and cellular telephones and in Internet applications. Both of these software offerings illustrate additional examples of voice authentication software that may be incorporated into the speech services module 302d.<br>
The SpeakEZ voice print speaker verification functionality has been incorporated into a number of commercially available software development tool kits and interactive voice response (IVR) systems. These types of development tool kits and IVR systems are suitable for providing the transaction management system 302 with voice authentication functionality. Examples of commercially available software development tool kits and IVR systems incorporating SpeakEZ voice print speaker verification include the following.<br>

The transaction fulfillment system 304 includes a central processing unit (CPU) 304a, an information storage device 304b, a network interface system 304c, a barcode reader 304d, and barcode software 304e. A network server or a workstation comprise the CPU 304a. A Dell POWEREDGE series server illustrates an example of a suitable commercially available network server. A Dell PRECISION series workstation illustrates an example of a suitable commercially available workstation.<br>
The information storage device 304b, such as a disk drive unit, is coupled to the CPU 304a for storing information in non-volatile memory. A Dell PowerVault (TM) series storage device s an example of a suitable information storage device 304b.<br>
Fulfillment reply information, product information, and barcode information illustrate examples of information that may be retrieved from the information storage device 304b.<br>
The network interface system 304c is coupled to the CPU 304a for facilitating the communication of information between the transaction fulfillment system 304, the computer network system 306 and the wireless communication device 308. A router such as, for example, a Cisco Systems 7200 series unit coupled to a data service UNIT/CHANNEL service unit (hereinafter referred to as a DSU/CSU) such as, for example, an ADC Kentrox D-Serv (TM) series unit illustrates an example of the network interface system 304c.<br>
Depending on the volume of transaction requests fulfilled through the transaction fulfillment system 304, a network interface card ("NIC") and a modem illustrate two other examples of suitable network interface system 304C.<br>
The bar code reader 304d enables transaction codes, such as barcodes, to be optically scanned and decoded. The barcode reader 304d is coupled to the CPU 304a for communicating a scanned representation of a barcode to the CPU 304a. Several commercially available barcodes are offered by METROLOGIC Incorporated. Metrologic offers a Fixed-mount Scanner under the model no. S700I and an in-counter scanner under the model no. MS860.<br>
The barcode software 302e enables encoding and decoding of barcodes.

Barcode software that is commercially available from Omniplanar Incorporated, Peernet Incorporated and RVB Systems Group illustrate examples of the barcode software 302e.<br>
The client computer system 305 is the system of the entity that offers the product or service requested in the transaction request. The client computer system 305 communicates with the transaction management system 302 and the transaction fulfillment system 304 to facilitate the transaction. The client system 305 includes a network interface a CPU 305a, an information storage device 305b and a network interface device 305C.<br>
The CPU 305a is coupled to the information storage device 305b for storing information, such as product and service information, in non-volatile memory. The network interface device 305c is coupled between the CPU 305a and the computer network system 306 for enabling communication therebetween.<br>
The wireless communication device 308 includes a device controller 308a, audible devices 308b, a keypad 308c, a visual display 308d and a transceiver 308e. The device controller 308a is capable of controlling and integrating the operation of audible devices 308b, the keypad 308C, the visual display 308d and the transceiver 308e. The audible devices 308b, such as a microphone and a speaker, permit the transaction requester 312 to submit and hear spoken information. The keypad 308c permits the transaction requester 312 to submit keyed-in information. The visual display 308d permits the transaction requester 312 to view visual information being received by and communicated from the wireless communication device 308.<br>
The transceiver 308e is capable of enabling the communication of voice and data information between the wireless communication device 308 and the telecommunications network system 310. In this manner, information is communicated to and from the transaction management system 302 and the transaction fulfillment system 304. In the embodiment of the system architecture illustrated in Fig. 4, voice and data information is communicated to and from the transaction management system 302, and only data information is communicated to and from the transaction fulfillment system.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 5, the wireless communication device 308 includes a scrolling device 308e. A user interface 308f is displayable on the visual display 308d of the wireless communication device 308. Using the scrolling device 308e, a desired transaction code name 308g is selected from a list of transaction code names 308h displayed on the visual display 308d. An optically scannable transaction code 308i is displayed on the visual display 308D in response to selecting the desired transaction code name 308G.<br>
A wireless application protocol (WAP) enabled wireless telephone illustrates an example of the wireless communication device 308. In addition to WAP enabled wireless telephones and devices, wireless communication devices operating under other wireless protocols such as imode, sms and hdml may be utilized with the methods and systems disclosed herein. Wireless telephones capable of accessing computer networks, such as the Internet, are commercially available from several wireless telephone manufacturers.<br>
The transaction apparatus 300 of Fig. 4 permits wireless transaction to be carried out by telephonic-type wireless communication devices, such as Internet enabled wireless telephones. However, by replacing the telecommunication network system with a wireless local area network system or adding a wireless local area network system to the transaction apparatus 300, the transaction apparatus 300 may be used for facilitating a wireless transaction using a non-telephonic Internet enabled telephonic communication device, such as a wireless PDA. When carrying out transaction requests with such a non- telephonic wireless communication device, authentication of the transaction requester may be more effectively achieved by known data password techniques rather than voice authentication.<br>
The transaction apparatus 300, Fig. 4, is capable of enabling communication directly between a transaction fulfillment system 304 and a wireless communication device 308. To this end, the transaction fulfillment system 304 and the wireless communication device 308 each include a low power short range digital radio 314 integrated therein. Each digital radio 314 includes a radio transceiver for enabling voice and data information to be communicated between the transaction fulfillment system 304 and the wireless communication 308 without being communicated through the computer network system 306 or the telecommunication network system 310. The speed of information transfer between the transaction fulfillment system 304 and the wireless communication device 308 is significantly increased by eliminating the need to communicate such information through the computer network system 306 and the telecommunication network system 310.<br>
A Bluetooth radio illustrates one example of the digital radio 314. Bluetooth radios are based on a radio specification governed by the Bluetooth Special Interest group.<br>
The specification defines the standards for a tiny microchip that comprise a radio transceiver. Accordingly, Bluetooth radios are built into digital devices, such as cellular telephones, PDA, portable computers, etc.<br>
The Bluetooth radio makes communication of information nearly instant. It facilitates fast and secure transmissions of both voice and data, even when the devices are not within line-of-sight. The transceivers operates in a globally available frequency band, ensuring   compatibility   WORLDWIDE.   The   Ericsson   R520   wireless   telephone<br>
illustrates an example of a Bluetooth enabled wireless telephone. The R520 telephone is a triple mode phone with GPRS, Bluetooth radio, WAP capabilities.<br>
A key aspect of the system and method embodiments disclosed herein is the ability and functionality associated with optically scanning transaction codes from the visual display of the wireless communication device. Optical scanning of transaction codes facilitates a convenient and secure technique for allowing fulfillment of real world products and services from a wireless transaction. The transaction requester must simply pass the visual display of the wireless communication device over the barcode reader of the transaction fulfillment system to act on fulfillment of the wireless transaction.<br>
Many wireless communication devices, such as wireless telephones and wPDA's, have relatively small visual displays. As a result, optically scannable code communicated to the wireless communication devices must be relatively compact. One-dimensional barcodes and truncated two-dimensional barcodes illustrate examples of suitable barcodes for being communicated to devices having visual displays that are capable of displaying BITMAP images. It is anticipated that over time most commercially available wireless communication devices will be capable of displaying larger barcodes, such as two- dimensional barcodes. One of the advantages of a two-dimensional barcode is the ability to embed several thousand bytes of information in the barcode.<br>
Bar codes configured according to Code 128 Specification illustrates an example of a bar code configuration that is well suited for small visual displays of wireless telephones.<br>
Furthermore, most barcode readers in use today are capable of reading Code 128 barcodes.<br>
Code 128 barcodes are a very high-density alphanumeric symbology. The symbol can be as long as necessary to store the encoded data. It is designed to encode all 128 ASCII characters, and will use the least amount of space for data of 6 characters or more of any 1- D symbology. Each data character encoded in a Code 128 symbol is made up of 11 black or white modules. The stop character, however, is made up of 13<br>
modules. Three bars and three spaces are formed out of these 11 modules. Bar and spaces can vary between 1 and 4 modules wide.<br>
Presently, several commercially available wireless communication devices are not suitable capable of displaying bitmap images. A solution for communicating an optically scannable code to these types of wireless communication devices is to communicate a type of'hash code"to these of devices. One example of a hash code includes a string of forward slashes (/), representing a binary 1, and backward slashes (\), representing a binary 0. Suitable software would be required for decoding these types of code.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 4, the transaction management system (TMS) 302, transaction fulfillment system (TFS) 304, the client computer system (CCS) 305 and the wireless communication device (WCD) 308 are coupled in a manner for communicating information therebetween. In this embodiment, verification of the transaction barcodes and communication of the transaction barcodes are facilitated by the TMS 302. Furthermore, communication for determining the desired transaction is facilitated by the TMS 302.<br>
Referring to Fig. 6, an operation A of receiving, at the TMS 302, a transaction request from the WCD 308 is performed. After receiving the transaction request, an operation B of communicating a request for a spoken transaction requester authentication code (TRAC) from the TMS 302 to the WCD 308 is performed. The request for the spoken TRAC is intended to initiate an operation C of receiving, at the TMS 302, a spoken TRAC from the WCD 308. An operation D of communicating a requester authentication message (RAM) from the TMS 302 to the WCD 308 initiates an operation E of communicating a first transaction barcode (FTB) to the WCD 308. The request authentication message confirms that the transaction request is approved and that the FTB has been communicated. The TFS 304 and the TMS 302 may interact with the CCS 305 to facilitate and enable fulfillment of the transaction request.<br>
An operation F of scanning the FTB is performed after the operation E. In response to scanning the FTB, an operation G of receiving, at the TMS 302, a decoded representation of the FTB from the TFS 304 is performed. After receiving the decoded representation of the FTB and in response to the FTB being verified, an operation H of communicating a second transaction barcode (STB) from the TMS 302<br><br>
to the WCD 308 is performed. A first fulfillment event is typically also performed in response to the FTB being verified. An operation I of scanning the STB is performed after the operation H. In response to scanning the STB, an operation J of receiving, at the TMS 302, a decoded representation of the STB from the TFS 304 is performed. After receiving the decoded representation of the STB and in response to the STB being verified, an operation K of communicating a transaction fulfillment message (TFM) from the TMS 302 to the WCD 308 is performed. A second fulfillment event is typically performed in response to the FTB being verified. Communication of the TFM may be part of the second fulfillment event.<br>
After scanning and decoding the FTB and the STB, internal operations are conducted by the TFS 304, the TMS 304 or both. One such internal operation is communicating with a client computer system for enabling facilitation of the requested transaction. The TMS 302, the TFS 304 or both may use the fulfillment verification to initiate subsequent internal operations, such as removing a particular transaction offering from being available to transaction requesters.<br>
The first and second transaction barcodes enables the transaction requester to act on fulfillment of the real world products or services requested in the transaction request.<br>
Renting and taking possession of a rental car using a cellular telephone represents a viable commercial implementation of the methods disclosed herein, the system illustrated in Fig. 4 and the operations described in reference to Fig. 7.<br>
Example 1-CAR Rental A transaction requester who will be travel by plane to a different city uses his Internet enabled wireless telephone for renting a car for use during his trip. To this end, he contacts the TMS using his wireless telephone. He then interacts with a transaction requester user interface (TRUI) of his wireless telephone for communicating car rental information to and from car rental information from the TMS. The car rental information includes typical car rental information, such as rental dates, the type of car, etc. The TMS interacts with the OCS to complete the transaction request. For example, the TMS may interact with the OCS to determine whether the selected type of vehicle is available on the desired days.<br>
After he completes the transaction request, his identity is authenticated using voice authentication techniques, such as those described herein.<br>
After authenticating his identity, a FTB is communicated to his wireless telephone. When he arrives at the air port of the city he is traveling to, he accesses the TRUI for retrieving the FTB. He then passes the wireless telephone over one of many barcode readers of the TFS that are located throughout the airport. By doing so, the FTB is optically scanned from the visual display of his wireless telephone. By scanning the FTB, he has confirmed with the TFS that he has arrived at the airport and expects the car to be ready. After scanning the FTB, a STB is communicated to his wireless telephone.<br>
He then makes his way to the car rental lot. Once at the car rental lot, he accesses the TRUI for retrieving the STB. After retrieving the STB, he optically scans the STB from the visual display of his wireless telephone using a barcode reader that is located at the car rental lot. By scanning the STB, he has confirmed with the TFS that he has arrived at the car rental lot and is ready to take possession of the rental car. After scanning the STB, a TFM may be communicated to his wireless telephone. In such an instance, the TFM includes information, such as direction to his hotel, information about the city, etc.<br>
This example illustrates the convenience and time savings associated with using the methods and systems disclosed herein for renting a car when traveling.<br>
The advantages are especially significant to business travelers, as their schedules often change on short notice. However, the advantages associated with these methods and systems afford travelers of all types with a means of maintaining a tight travel schedule.<br>

For example, the TMS may interact with the OCS to determine whether seats are remaining for the desired movie at a desired time. After completing the transaction request, her identity is authenticated in response to her keying in her password.<br>
After authenticating her identity, a FTB is communicated to her PDA.<br>
When she arrives at the theater, she accesses the TRUI for retrieving the FTB. She then passes the PDA over a barcode reader that is located at the entrance of the theater. In this manner, the FTB is optically scanned from the visual display of her PDA. Scanning the FTB activates a first turnstile allowing her to gain entry into the lobby of the theater. In some instances, it may also activate a ticket dispenser in the turnstile to dispense a physical ticket for the specified movie. After scanning the FTB, a STB is communicated, to her PDA.<br>
She then makes her way toward the auditorium portion of the theater. To gain access to the auditorium portion of the theater, she retrieves the STB. After retrieving the STB, she passes the PDA over a barcode reader that is located at the entrance of the auditorium portion of the theater. Scanning the STB activates a second turnstile allowing her to gain access to the auditorium portion of the theater.<br>
After scanning the STB, a transaction fulfillment message is sent to her PDA. The transaction fulfillment message includes information such as directions to the particular auditorium her movie is in, interactive or exclusive information about the movie, etc.<br>
