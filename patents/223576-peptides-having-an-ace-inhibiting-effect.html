COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10 and Rule 13)<br>
PEPTIDES HAVING AN ACE INHIBITING EFFECT<br>
HINDUSTAN   LEVER   LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at  Hindustan   Lever  House,      165/166,   Backbay  Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
WO 2005/058070<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/013223<br><br>
1<br>
Peptides having an ACE inhibiting effect<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The invention relates to certain peptides   for the <br>
5   preparation of an angiotensin-converting enzyme   (ACE) inhibitor.   The invention further relates to food products suitable for ACE inhibition and to a process  for preparing such food products.<br>
10  Background to the invention<br>
Hypertension or high blood pressure is considered to be one of the main risk factors  for Cardio Vascular Diseases (CVD) .   One of the mechanisms which regulates blood pressure is the  renin-angiotensin system.   This is a  cascade of<br>
15  reactions  leading to the  formation of angiotensin II,   which has a strong vasoconstrictive and hence blood pressure increasing effect.   Inhibition of one of the key. enzymes  in this cascade:  Angiotensin I Converting Enzyme   (ACE)   reduces formation of angiotensin II and thus has a blood pressure<br>
20  lowering effect.  Long term human intervention studies have shown regular intake of low amounts of ACE  inhibitors reduces CVD by 25%   (Gerstein et al.   (2000) ,   The Lancet 355, 253-259).<br>
25  ACE-inhibitors  in food products are well known.   Such food products have for instance been prepared t&gt;y fermentation  of milk or milk products.   In a placebo-controlled  study,   the blood pressure  lowering effect of VPP and   IPP in  sour milk was  shown  in hypertensive humans   (Hata,   Y   et  al.    (1996),<br>
30  American  Journal  of Clinical Nutrition   64r    767-771) .<br><br>
WO 2005/058070<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/013223<br><br>
2<br>
A commercially available fermented milk product, which claims to be "suitable for those with mild hypertension" is Calpis sour milk, fermented with Lactobacillus helveticus, produced by Calpis Food Industry, Japan. Another <br>
5  commercially available fermented milk product is Evolus produced by Valio, Finland, which claims to be "'the first European functional food to help lower blood pressure'. These fermented milk products are fermented with Lactobacillus helveticus   (Lb.  helveticus)   strains. The <br>
10 products contain bio-active peptides (VPP and IPP)<br>
responsible for in vitro  ACE inhibition, which are produced by proteolysis of caseins.<br>
Another possibility identified in the prior art is 15 preparation of ACE-inhibiting food products by enzymatic hydrolysis of milk proteins. WO 01/85984 describes the preparation of an ACE-suppressing composition by hydrolysis of casein isolate using the enzyme trypsin.<br>
20 Summary of the invention<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide a food product suitable for ACE inhibition. It is another object to provide such food products having blood pressure lowering effect. It is still a further object to provided food<br>
25 product having a high concentration of ACE-inhibitor. One or more of these objects is attained according to the invention by the use of the tripeptide XPP, wherein X= C, M, S, T, or K and/or the salts thereof for the preparation of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor.<br>

WO 2005/058070<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/013223<br><br>

Detailed description of the invention<br>
The common one letter code is used herein as ordinarily used to describe amino-acids.<br>
The weight percentages herein will be expressed, relative to 5 the total weight, unless otherwise indicated.<br>
Enzyme is herein understood to also include a mixture of more than one enzymes.<br>
10 According to the invention, we have found that the<br>
tripeptide XPP according to the invention is relatively stable after human consumption and that the peptide XPP according to the invention is an effective angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Preferably the angiotensin-<br>
15 converting enzyme inhibitor is a functional food product.<br>
In XPP, X= C, M, S, T, or K. Preferably X= C, M, S, or T, more preferably X= M, S, or T.<br>
20 The invention provides a food product suitable for<br>
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition and lowering of blood pressure in humans comprising an amount 1 mg/g or more of XPP, wherein X= C, M, S, T, or K, preferably 25mg/g or more of XPP, more preferably the food product comprises<br>
25 an amount of 50 mg/g or more, even more preferably 100 mg/g or more XPP, wherein X= C, M, S, T, or K, preferably X= C, M, S, or T, more preferably X= M, S, or T.<br>
Food products according to the invention are defined as <br>
30 products, suitable for human consumption, in which an XPP according to the invention was used as an ingredient in an<br><br>
WO 2005/058070<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/013223<br><br>
4<br>
effective amount, such that a noticeable ACE-inhibitory effect is obtained.<br>
Though not wishing to be bound to theory herein, it is <br>
5 believed that the tripeptides according to the invention are good ACE-inhibitors, since they are:<br>
•	relatively small in size [length between 2 and 10<br>
amino acids]<br>
10   •	neutral or positively charged<br>
•	not composed of negatively charged residues<br>
•	composed of hydrophobic, branched amino acids<br>
•	have a C-terminal Proline residue<br>
15 Further it is believed that to the presence of two successive Pro-residues, the release of the last two residues by ACE in the case of XPP is significantly hindered due to steric constraints.<br>
20 Additionally it is believed that the presence or the C-<br>
terminal PP (-Pro-Pro) sequence renders the peptide(s) more stable towards human digestive enzymes, peptidases associated with brush-border membrane of the human intestinal epithelium cells and peptidases in the human<br>
25 blood circulation. Therefore, it is believed that the consumption of a food product containing the peptide(s) will result in the effective absorption of the peptide(s) in the human body, which will induce ACE-inhibition and lowering of blood pressure.<br>
30 <br>
WO 2005/058070<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/013223<br><br>
5<br>
Summarising these observations it can be deduced that any peptide that that is not too long and composed of hydrophobic amino acids, neutral or positively charged and bearing a C-terminal Pro [or-Pro-Pro] sequence is <br>
5 intrinsically a good inhibitor for ACE.<br>
In general the results are in agreement with the observations, the best ACE-inhibiting XPP-peptides are composed of neutral and hydrophobic amino acids. The reason<br>
10 that large hydrophobic residues like Trp, Tyr and Phe are not included resides from the fact that - most likely -these residues, in combination with the two Pro residues, are too bulky for a proper fit in the active site of the enzyme.<br>
15<br>
The reason that CPP is included derives from the fact that ACE is a Zn-containing enzyme and interaction of the substrate with the Zn-atom is essential for binding between substrate and enzyme, the presence of the free sulphydryl-<br>
20 group of Cys favors this interaction.<br>
The following proteins (and their precursors) have, for example, been identified to contain mentioned XPP sequences within the primary structure of their constitutional 25 proteins and their sources:<br>
CPP: collagen [chicken], troponin [chicken], thyroglobin<br>
[bovine] MPP: albumin [garden pea, mung bean], myosin [bovine, <br>
30     chicken, pig, yeast], zein [maize]<br>
SPP: collagen [chicken], casein [bovine], legumin [garden pea, Pea Sativum].<br><br>
WO 2005/058070<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/013223<br><br>
6<br>
TPP; collagen [chicken], glutenin [wheat], cruceferin<br>
[rape], legumin [cotton], myosin [yeast], zein [maize]<br>
TPP: collagen  [chicken],  glutenin  [wheat],  cruceferin [rape], legumin [cotton], myosin [yeast], zein [maize] <br>
5  KPP: myosin [pig, chicken, yeast], casein [pig]<br>
These protein materials may, for instance be used as a substrate, from which the peptides according to the invention may be liberated. The skilled person will know to <br>
10 use known fermentation or known enzyme treatment, for instance enzymatic hydrolysis to achieve this.<br>
Through optimization of the fermentation or hydrolysis conditions, the production of the biologically active<br>
15 molecule XPP according to the invention may be maximized. The skilled person trying to maximize the production will know how to adjust the process parameters, such as hydrolysis time, hydrolysis temperature, enzyme type and concentration etc.<br>
20<br>
Preferably, in the production of the XPP, the molar yield of XPP is high. The molar yield of XPP is defined as the molar amount of XPP produced divided by the molar amount of XPP fragments in the total mass of protein present in the<br>
25 starting material prior to hydrolysis.<br>
The enzyme used in enzymatic hydrolysis may be any enzyme that is able to effectively hydrolyze a substrate containing XPP, resulting in the liberation of one or more<br>
30 XPP, wherein X= C, M, S, T, or K.<br><br>
WO 2005/058070<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/013223<br><br>
7<br>
The enzyme treatment may be done in a conventional manner. It involves adding enzyme (or a mixture of enzymes) to the substrate and maintaining the resulting reaction mixture under controlled conditions suitable for conducting the <br>
5  enzymatic hydrolysis.  The conditions to be controlled include temperature, pH, reaction time and enzyme concentration. The preferred temperature of the reaction mixture is 40-60 degrees C, more preferred 45-55 degrees C and most preferred about 50 degrees C. The pH of the<br>
10 reaction mixture is preferably 5 to 9, more preferably 6-8 and most preferably about 7. The enzyme concentration is 2-10 wt.% based on the total weight of the reaction mixture, more preferably 3-10 and most preferably 4-6 wt%. The reaction time (hydrolysis time) is preferably 2-50 hours,<br>
15 more preferably 2- 10 hours and most preferably-4-8 hours.<br>
In another preferred embodiment the hydrolysis step may be substituted by a fermentation step with microorganism that will cause hydrolysis of the substrate. <br>
20<br>
The materials in the fermentor and substrate may be mixed in conventional way, in order to achieve a homogeneous fermentation medium.<br>
25 The fermentation advantageously may be performed at 25 to 50° C and preferably 35 to 45° C, for 3 to 80 hours and preferably 6 to 25 hours.<br>
Advantageously, after enzyme treatment and optional <br>
30 fermentation, several additional process steps may be executed.<br><br>
WO 2005/058070<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/013223<br><br>
8	:<br>
Preferably according to the invention a process for the preparation of a food product comprising XPP, wherein X= C, M, S, T, or K, involving the following steps is used:<br>
5   a)enzymatic hydrolysis of a substrate comprising protein having the sequence XPP, resulting in a hydrolyzed protein product;<br>
b)separation from the hydrolyzed protein product of a <br>
10     fraction rich in tripeptide;<br>
c)drying the fraction from step b) to obtain a solid rich in tripeptide XPP;<br>
15   d)using the solid prepared in step c) as an ingredient in the preparation of the food product.<br>
After the enzymatic hydrolysis step a), therefore there may be an optional separation step or concentration step. This<br>
20   step may be executed in any way known to the skilled person, e.g. by filtration,. centrifugation or chromatography and combinations thereof. Preferably the separation step is executed using an ultrafiltration (UF) and/or nanofiltration (NF) techniques. The pore size of the<br>
25 membranes used in the filtration step, as well as the charge of the membrane may be used to control the separation of the tripeptide XPP. The fractionation of protein hydrolysates using charged UF/NF membranes is described in Y. Poilot et al, Journal of Membrane Science<br>
30 158 (1999) 105-114. Electrodialysis is for instance<br>
described in WO00/42066. The product of such separation step is herein called the ACE-fraction.<br><br>

9<br>
Optionally the hydrolysis product may be dried, to obtain a solid rich in tripeptide XPP, wherein X= C, M, S, T, or K. This step may be done in a conventional way, e.g. by spray <br>
5 drying or freeze drying.<br>
The dried product prepared in is hereafter designated as ACE-solid. The ACE-fraction and/or the ACE-solid may advantageously be used as an ingredient in a food product.<br>

Examples<br>
Example 1<br>
A large number of peptides were screened for their ACE-<br>
5 inhibiting effects (IC50 values were measured). In addition all peptides were screened for stability during exposure to human serum, HUVEC, Caco-2 cells and gastrointestinal enzymes as described below.<br>
10 The materials and methods used in Example 1 are described below.<br>
Cell  culture<br>
Caco-2 cells were obtained from American Type Culture<br>
15 Collection (ATCC) and used in experiments at passage 30-40. Cells were cultured in 75 cm2 culture flasks (Corning Costar, Badhoevedorp, The Netherlands). The culture medium consisted of DMEM (high glucose, with L-glutamine) supplemented with 20% (v/v) foetal bovine serum, 1% (v/v)<br>
20 penicillin/streptomycin solution and 1% (v/v) NEAA. Cells were maintained at 37° C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. For stability experiments, cells were seeded on 12 well cell culture plates (Costar, Badhoevedorp, The Netherlands) and cultured for at least 21 days.<br>
25<br>
HUVEC Cells<br>
HUVEC cells were obtained from (Cambrex Bio Science, Verviers, Belgium) and used in experiments at passage 1-5. Cells were cultured in 75 cm2 culture flasks (Corning<br>
30 Costar, Badhoevedorp, The Netherlands). The culture medium (Cambrex) consisted of EBM-2 supplemented with 2% (v/v) foetal bovine serum, 0.04 % (v/v) Hydrocortisone, 0.4 %<br><br>

(v/v) human Fibroblast Growth Factor Basic with heparin, 0.1 % (v/v) Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor, 0.1 % (v/v) human recombinant Insulin-like Growth Factor, 0.1 % (v/v) Ascorbic acid, 0,1 % (v/v) human recombinant Epidermal <br>
5 Growth Factor, 0.1 % (v/v) Gentamicin, Amphotericin-B and 0.1% (v/v) Heparin. Cells were maintained at 37° C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. For stability experiments, cells were seeded in a 12 well plate (Corning Costar, Badhoevedorp, The Netherlands) at a density of <br>
10 100.000 cells/well and cultured for 2 days.<br>
Test products<br>
Peptide mixture 1 consisted of VPP, IPP, IIAEK, ITP, VF, FY, KVLPVP, and HLPLP. ^Mixture 2 consisted of VAP, GPR, <br>
15 CPP, MPP, SPP, TPP, PIP, and PLP. The synthetic peptides were either ordered from Bachem (dipeptides KPP and GPR) or from the University of Utrecht (Dr. M. Egmond).<br>
The peptides were dissolved separately in a concentration <br>
20 of 5 mg in 50 pi milliQ water or DMSO. For some peptides the concentration was corrected for purity (ITP 60%, KVLPVP 85%). The remaining peptides were &gt;95% pure. All peptides were dissolved in milli Q water except for the dipeptides. FY was dissolved in DMSO. Since FY was still not soluble <br>
25 some HCl (final concentration 0.3M) was added. VF was<br>
directly dissolved in 0.3M HCl. To prepare mixture 1, 50 µl of each peptide were mixed together and 100 pi milli Q water was added, yielding a 500 pi solution containing 5 mg of each peptide (in 0.06M HCl and 10% DMSO). Mixture 2 was <br>
30   prepared in the same way, with the exception of- the addition of an extra 50 pi milli Q water. The final composition of mixture 2 was also l0mg/ml of each peptide.<br><br>

Stability  tests  with serum,   HUVEC and Caco-2  cells Peptide mixtures were added to human serum (Cambrex Bio <br>
5  Science, Verviers, Belgium) at a final concentration of 0,1 1 and 10 pg peptide/L. Serum containing the peptide-mixtures were incubated for 0, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 60, 120, 240  and 360 minutes at 37° C. Samples of 1.5 ml were collected in eppendorf vials at each of the time points.<br>
10 Immediately thereafter, 30 pi of 10% (v/v) trifluoro acetic acid (TFA) and 5 µl of a 10 pg UC13-IPP/10 ml were added to the samples. Samples were subsequently incubated for 5 min at 100° C and then centrifugated in an IEC Micromax RF centrifuge (Boom BV Meppel) at 10.000 rpm for 20 minutes.<br>
15 The supernatant was collected in eppendorf vials and stored at -20°C for further analysis. Experiments were performed in triplicate.<br>
Cells were cultured in 12-well plates. Peptide mixtures <br>
20 were added to culture medium without foetal bovine serum, but containing 20 % (v/v) solid phase extracted foetal bovine serum. For HUVEC, 400 pi medium containing 0.1, 1 and 10 pg/ml peptide was added to a well of the culture plate. Three times 130 pi medium was collected at 0, 5, 10, <br>
25 20, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min of incubation. For Caco-2 cells, 330 pi medium containing 0.1, 1 and 10 pg/ml peptide was added to each well of the culture plate. Three times 110 pi medium was collected at 0, 5, 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, 180 and 360 min of incubation. Experiments were performed in <br>
30 triplicate and all samples were directly placed-on dry-ice and stored at - 20°C. For peptide quantification measurement, TFA and UC13-IPP (final concentrations of 0.2%<br><br>

PCT/EP2004/013223<br><br>
16<br>
(v/v) and 60 ng/ml, respectively) were added to the samples. Wells without cells served as controls.<br>
ACE-inhibition assay 1:  Enzyme based Assay   (EBA)<br>
 5  ACE and a synthetic substrate (Abz-FRK-(Dnp)P-OH) were used in the ACE-inhibition assay performed in white optiplate-96 microplates (Packard Bioscience). The substrate was a kind gift of Adriana K. Carmona (Dept. of Biophysics, Escola Paulista de Medivina, Universidae Federal de Sao Paulo,<br>
10  Brazil). Stock solutions of Abz-FRK-(Dnp)P-OH were prepared in DMSO. The concentration was measured spectrophotometrically using the molar extinction coefficient S365 = 17300 M^crrf1. The assay buffer composition was 100 mM tris/HCl buffer pH 7.0 containing<br>
15 100 mM NaCl. Forty pi sample solution in assay buffer was added to each well. In case of the controls only buffer was added. The samples were measured in threefold in a fluorophotometer (Fluostar, BMG labtechnologies). The device first dispersed 150pl substrate (3.75 µM in assay<br>
20  buffer) and subsequently added 20ul of ACE (0.00625<br>
Units/ml) to each well. The ACE activity was measured for 10 cycles (about 10 minutes) by measuring the fluorescence at λex = 320nm and Xem -  420nm. The raw data was converted to the slope/sec and the ACE inhibition activity was<br>
25  calculated using the equation below.<br><br>
WO 2005/058070	PCT/EP2004/013223<br>
ACE inhibition (%) = [1 - (Smean - Bmean) / (Cmean - Bmean )] *100<br>
Where<br>
5 Smean = average	result	of sample (peptide + substrate + ACE)<br>
Bmean = average	result	of background (substrate)<br>
Cmean = average	result	of control (ACE + substrate)<br>
ACE-inhibition assay 2:  Modified Matsui  assay 10 This ACE inhibition activity was assayed according to the method of Matsui et al. (Matsui, T. et al. (1992) Biosci. Biotech.   Biochem.  56: 517-518) with the modifications described below.<br>
15 Table 1:  procedure for Matsui ACE inhibition assay. The components were added in a 1.5-ml tube with a final volume<br>

0.25 M bicine (4:6)) was added, followed by 25 µl 0.1 M TNBS (2,4,6-Trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid, Fluka, Switzerland; in 0.1 M Na2HP04) . After incubation for 20 min. at'37°C, 4 ml 4 mM Na2S03 in 0.2 M NaH2P04 was added <br>
5 and the absorbance at 416 nm was measured with UV/Vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-1601 with a CPS controller, Netherlands).<br>
The amount of ACE inhibition (ACEI) activity was calculated as a percentage of inhibition compared with the-conversion<br>
10 rate of ACE in the absence of an inhibitor:<br>
ACEI (%) = (((C1-C2)-(S1-S2))/(C1-C2)) * 100       (1)<br>

In vitro gastrointestinal  digestion<br>
 5 The stability of peptides in the human gastrointestinal tract was studied by subjecting fermented or hydrolysed milk proteins to typical conditions in the stomach and small intestine. Gastric conditions were mimicked by dissolving 80 ml fermented or hydrolysed milk protein in <br>
10 820 ml water containing 2.0 g NaCl, 2.9 g pepsin and 0.45 g Amano Lipase F-AP15 from Rhizopus oryzae.   The fluid was adjusted to pH 3.5 with HC1, stirred with a peddle (50 rpm) and kept at 37° C for 60 min. Subsequently, intestinal conditions were mimicked by adding 9 g pancreatin and 125<br><br>
