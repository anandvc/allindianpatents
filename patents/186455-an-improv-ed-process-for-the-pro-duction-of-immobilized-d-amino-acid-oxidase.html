				<td>This invention relates to an improved process for the production of immobilized D-amino acid oxidase. The invention particularly relates to immobilization of D-amino acid oxidase on crosslinked macroporous glycidyl methacrylate-divinyl benzene copolymer matrix useful for the preparation of glutaryl-7-aminocephalosporanicacid.<br>
D-Amino acid oxidase finds application in the pharmaceutical industry in bioconversion of cephalosporin C to 7-amino cephalosporanic acid (7-ACA) which is a key intermediate in production of various clinically important semisynthetic cephalosporins.<br>
This bioconversion involves use of two enzymes namely D-amino acid oxidase and glutaryl acylase. D-Amino acid oxidase converts cephalosporin C to keto-adipyl-7-amino cephalosporanic acid which in presence of generated hydrogen peroxide is spontaneously converted to glutaryl-7-amino cephalosporanic acid(glutaryl-7-ACA). Glutaryl-7-ACA is then deacylated by glutaryl acylase to 7-ACA. Thus, D-amino acid oxidase is an enzyme of industrial importance.<br>
D-Amino acid oxidase from a variety of microorganisms find application in production of keto acids from respective amino acids. However, very few D-amino acid oxidase preparations accept cephalosporin C as substrate. Trigonopsis variabilis, Rhodotorula gracilis, Fusarium solani M-0718, Bacillus Licheniformis, Rhodotorula glutinis, Aspergillus sp. strain O20 produce D-amino acid oxidase in high yields which is active on cephalosporin C.<br><br>
Two types of biocatalysts are used in the production of glutaryl-7-ACA:<br>
i)        Immobilized whole cells of the microorganism containing the D-amino<br>
acid oxidase as       described in Japan Kokai Koho JP 79 134 592 and<br>
Bioprocess Engineering, vol. 12, p.         249-252, 1995;<br>
and ii)       Immobilized   D-amino   acid   oxidase   on   commercial   matrices   as<br>
described  in German  Patent DE 4028  119;  Czeck CS 251  457;<br>
European Patents Appl. EP 492 495 and 496 993; Annals of New York<br>
Academy of Sciences, vol. 672, p. 502-509, 1992 and Enzyme and<br>
Microbial Technology, vol. 17, p. 324-329, 1995.<br>
Of these, the immobilized enzyme preparations are prefered. This is because the immobilized whole cells have shorter operational life, the product is contaminated by the metabolites secreted by the cells and the diffusion of substrate and products is hindered by the cell wall components.<br>
For immobilization of D-amino acid oxidase, the matrix should provide appropriate microenvironment for availability of oxygen, availability of hydrogen peroxide released during the reaction and required for chemical reaction, availability of the enzyme molecules for the reaction and instant diffusion of substrate (cephalosporin C) and products such as glutaryl-7-ACA, ammonia, carbon dioxide etc.<br>
In our copending Application No. 2937/DEL/97, we have described and claimed a proces for the preparation of crosslinked macroporous glycidyl<br><br>
methacrylate - divinyl benzene copolymers which are designed to have physical and chemical properties desired for immobilization of D-amino acid oxidase.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide an improved process for production of immobilized D-amino acid oxidase using crosslinked macroporous glycidyl methacrylate-divinyl benzene copolymers.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an improved process for the production of immobilized D-amino acid oxidase, which comprises suspending crosslinked macroporous glycidyl methacrylate-divinyl benzene copolymers in phosphate buffer, adding D-amino acid oxidase solution, incubating the suspension at a temperature in the range of 20 to 24oC for a period in the range of 9 to 12 hours with agitation ranging from 60 to 120 rpm, separating the immobilized D-amino acid oxidase by conventional filtration methods.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the molarity of the phosphate buffer may be in the range of 0.05 to 0.10.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the pH of the phosphate buffer may be in the range of 6.8 to 7.2.<br><br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention, the glycidyl methacrylate-divinyl benzene copolymers are prepared as described and claimed in our copending application number 2937/DEL/97.<br>
D-Amino acid oxidase solution used is obtained from Aspergillus sp. strain O20 by fermentation. The soluble D-amino acid oxidase preparation has a specific activity of 1.2 ID. The D-amino acid oxidase activity was determined by using cephalosporin C as substrate at 37oC and pH 8.0 as described in Biocatalysis and Biotransformation, vol. 12, p. 215-219, 1995 and in Methods in Enzymology, vol. 3, p. 414-418, 1957.<br>
