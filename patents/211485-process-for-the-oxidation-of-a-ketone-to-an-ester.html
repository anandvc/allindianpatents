				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a process for the oxidation of ketones to esters. The process involves contacting the ketone with hydrogen peroxide and a catalyst which comprises a tin substituted molecular sieve at oxidation conditions to form the corresponding ester.<br>
Esters and lactones (cyclic esters) have various uses in and of themselves and also can be intermediates in the synthesis of antib otics, steroids, phermones, fragrances and monomers. In 1899 Adolph Baeyer and Victor Villiger first reported the oxidation of menthone and tetrahydrocarvc ne to the corresponding lactones, The reaction was carried out using monopersulfuric acid, which was the most powerful oxidant known at that time. There has been considerable interest in the Baeyer-Villiger reaction in academia and in industry with numerous papers being published. See, e.g., G. Strukui, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. ,2 7, 11-98(1998).<br>
The reaction is usually carried out with organic per-acids. When the oxidait is hydrogen peroxide, there are reports of using transition metal catalysts for th5 Baeyer-Villiger reaction. For example, Jacobson et al., J.Chem. Soc, Chen'. Comun., 888, (1978) and in Inorg. Chem., 17, 3055 (1978), have disclosed the use of molybdenum(VI) peroxo-complexes as catalysts in comb nation with 98% hydrogen peroxide as the oxidant. W.A. Herrmann, et al., in J. Viol. Catal., 94, 213 (1994) have disclosed that the di-peroxo complex of methyl trioxorhenium is also active for the Baeyer-Villiger reaction. In his paper, Strukul also reports on the use of platinum complexes to carry out the oxidation of kelones in conjunction with 35% hydrogen peroxide. Finally, A. Bhaumik et al., in Catal. Lett., 40, 47 (1996) discloses the use of titanium silicalite (TS-1) as a catalyst for the oxidation of ketones in conjunction with hydrogen penxide. However, the use of TS-1 gave selectivities to the ester of below 50% with hydrcxycarboxylic acids being the major by-products.<br>
In contrast to the work disclosed above, applicants have developed a process for converting ketones to esters or lactones, which uses as the catalyst<br><br>
a tin substituted molecular sieve in conjunction with hydrogen peroxide, The catalyst has an empirical formula on an anhydrous basis of:<br>
(MwSnxTiySi1.x-y-zGe2)02<br>
where M represents a metal having a +3 valence such as Al or B and "w" s the mole faction of M and varies from 0 to 2x. The value of "x" can be from 0.001 to 0.1 while "y" and "z" have, respectively, values of 0 to 0.1 and 0 to 0.08. The catalysts of this invention have been found to have higher conversions; and virtualy exclusive selectivity to the lactones.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is the conversion of ketones; and especially cyclic ketones to esters and especially lactones. Accordingly, one embodiment of the invention is a process for the oxidation of a ketone to an ester comprising contacting a ketone with hydrogen peroxide and a catalyst at oxidaion conditions to provide the corresponding ester, the catalyst comprising a molecular sieve having an empirical formula on a calcined and anhydrous basis of;<br>
(MwSnxTiySi1-x-y-2Gez)02<br>
where M is a metal having a +3 valence, "w" is the mole fraction of M and varies from 0 to 2x, "x" is the mole fraction of tin and varies from 0.001 to 0.1, "y" is the mole fraction of titanium and varies from zero to 0.1 and "z" is the mole fraction of gemanium and varies from zero to less than 0.08 and characterized in that the composition has the characteristic x-ray diffraction pattern of zeolite beta, and when "w", "y" and "z" are all zero, then the molecular sieve is amorphous with stiort range order or has the characteristic x-ray diffraction pattern of zeolite beta.<br>
This and other objects and embodiments of the invention will become more apparent after a detailed description of the invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
As stated, the present application deals with a process (known as the Baeyer-Villiger reaction) in which ketones are converted to esters. It is preferred to convert cyclic ketones to cyclic esters which are generally called factones. One essential part of this process is a catalyst which comprises a tin containing molecular sieve having the characteristic x-ray diffraction pattern of zeolite beta and an empirical formula on a calcined and anhydrous basis of:<br>
(MwSnxTiySii.x.y.zGez)02<br>
"x" is :he mole fraction of tin and varies from 0.001 to 0.1, "y" is the mole fraction of titanium and varies from zero to 0.1 and "z" is the mole fraction of germanium and varies from zero to less than 0.08. However, when "w", "y" and "z" ere all zero, then the molecular sieve is either amorphous with short range order or has the zuolite beta structure. The M metals which can be used include but are not limited to aluminum, boron, gallium, and iron; and "w" is the mole fraction of M and varies from 0 to 2x. These molecular sieves have a microporous three dimensional framework structure of at least SiOa and SnO2 tetrahedral unite;, and a crystallographically regular pore system.<br>
These molecular sieves are prepared using a hydrothermal crystallisation process in which a reaction mixture is prepared by combining reactive sources of tin, silicon, an organic templating agent, optionally germanium, optionally titanium, optionally a M metal, a fluoride or hydroxide source, optiDnally hydrcgen peroxide and water. The sources of silicon include but are not I'mited to colloidal silica, amorphous silica, fumed silica, silica gel and tetrae Ikylorthosilicate. Sources of tin include but are not limited to tin halides, tin alkoxdes, tin oxide, metallic tin, alkaline and alkaline earth stannates and alkyl tin compounds. A preferred source is tin tetrachloride. Examples of tin alkoxdes include tin butoxide, tin ethoxide and tin propoxide. The o-ganic templating agents include, without limitation, tetraalkyiammoniurn ions such as tetraethylammonium ions, aza-polycyclic compounds such as 1,4-diazaticyclo 2,2,2 octane; dialkyldibenzylammonium ions such as dimethyldibenzyl ammonium ion and bis-piperidinium ions such as 4,4' trimethylene bis (N-benzyl N-methyi pipehdinium) ion. These ions may be added as the hydroxide or nalide<br>
compounds, Germanium sources include germanium halides, germanium alkoxices and germanium oxides. Titanium sources include titanium alkoxides and titanium halides. Preferred titanium alkoxides are titanium tetraethoxide, titanium isopropoxide and titanium tetrabutoxide. When M is aluminum the sources of aluminum include but are not limited to aluminum oxides, such as pesudo-boehmite, aluminum alkoxides such as aluminum isopropoxide, sodium alumirate and aluminum trichloride, with pseudo-boehmite and aluminum alkoxides being preferred. Sources of boron, gallium and iron include oxides, hydroxides, alkoxides, nitrates, sulfates, halides, carboxylates and mixtures thereof. Representative compounds include without limitation boron alkoxides, gallium alkoxides, iron (II) acetate, etc.<br>
The reaction mixture will also contain either a fluoride source such as hydrofluoric acid or ammonium fluoride or a hydroxide source such as scdium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide. The hydroxide source may also be added by using the hydroxide compound of the templating agent. Water is also added to the mixture and optionally hydrogen peroxide.<br>
Generally, the hydrothermal process used to prepare the tin containing molecular sieves involves forming a reaction mixture, using the sources stated above, which is expressed by the formula:<br>
where "k" has a value from zero to 0.1 , "a" has a value from 0.06 to 0.5, "b" nas a value from 0.001 to 0.1 , "c" has a value from zero to 0.08, "d" has a value f pom 0 to 0.1 "e" has a value from 0.1 to 2, "f" has a value from zero to 0.5 and "g" has a value from 4 to 50. The reaction mixture is prepared by mixing the desired sources of tin, silicon, optionally titanium, optionally germanium, optionally a M metal an organic templating agent, water, optionally hydrogen peroxide and a fluoric e or hydroxide source in any order to give the desired mixture. It is also necessary that the pH of the mixture be in the range of 6 to 12 and preferably in the range of 7.5 to 9,5. If necessary the pH of the mixture can be adjusted by adding HF, NH4F, NaOH, KOH, etc. Hydrogen peroxide may be added in order to form a complex with titanium and maintain it in solution.<br>
Having formed the reaction mixture, it is next reacted at a temperature of 90°C 1o 200°C and preferably 120°C to 180°C for a time of 2 days to 50 days and p'eferably from 10 days to 25 days in a sealed reaction vessel under autogenous pressure, After the allotted time, the mixture is filtered to isolate the solid product, which is washed with deionized water and dried in air.<br>
In order to promote crystallization of the zeolite beta phase, it is preferred to add zeolite beta crystals as seeds to the reaction mixture. These crystals can be added as a dry solid, a suspension in an appropriate liquid, e.g., water, alcohol or a preorganized gel, i.e., a gel which contains nuclei. A preferred zeolite beta seed is one prepared according to the teachings of Spanish Patent Application No. P9501552.<br>
The isolated molecular sieve is characterized in that it has the x-ray diffraction pattern characteristic of zeolite beta which includes at least the peaks and intensities presented in Table A. The intensity presented in Table A is a relative intensity which is obtained by relating the intensity of each peak (I) to the strongest line (I0), The intensity is given by the equation 100 x I/I0 and are represented by vs, s, m and w, where these are defined as: vs = 80 - 100; s = 60-80; m = 15-60 and w = 0-15.<br>
Table A(Table Removed)When the only elements which are present in the framework are Sn and Si, the molecular sieve can either have the zeolite beta structure or be amorphous with short range order. The amorphous composition has the charscteristics of the material described in U.S. patent no. 3,556,725.<br>
As synthesized, the molecular sieves of this invention wi!! contain some of the orcianic templating agent and fluoride ions in the pores of the sieve. In order to activate the zeolite, i.e., active for adsorption or catalytic reactions, it is necessary to remove the organic template and fluoride. This is generally accomplished by calcining the molecular sieve at a temperature of 300°C to 1000°0 for a time sufficient to remove substantially all the organic template and fluoride which usually is 1 to 10 hrs.<br>
As stated, the molecular sieves described above have very good activity as catalysts for the oxidation of ketones to esters. Examples of ketones which can bs used in the Instant process include, without limitation, alkyl ketones, cyclic ketones, alkyl substituted cyclic ketones, aryl ketones and alkyl aryi ketonos. Specific examples include cyclopentanone, cyclohexanone, rr ethyl cyclop entanone, methyl cyclohexanone, n-pentylcyclopentanone, t-butyl cyclof exanone and adamantanone.<br>
The process involves contacting the ketone with a catalyst (as described above) and hydrogen peroxide at oxidation conditions. Oxidation conditions for the instant process include a temperature of 20°C to 120°C, and preferably 40°C to 90°C, a pressure of atmospheric to 400 kPa, and a contact time of 10 rrin. to 24 hours and preferably a time of 1 hour to 12 hours. As stated, it is also required to use hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide can be obtained as a solution having a concentration of 3% to 70% of H2O2 by weight of the solution. Any of these commercially available solutions can be used in the instant process with e 35% solution being preferred. The ketone may be present neat or it can be mixed with a solvent, with the use of a solvent being preferred. Examples of solvents which can be used include but are not limited to alcohols, ethers, aceta s and acetonitrile.<br>
The process can be carried out in either a batch mode or a continuous mode. In a batch mode, the catalyst, ketone and H2O2 are mixed in a siitable reactor preferably with stirring at the desired temperature for a time of 10 min. to 24 hours and preferably a time of 1 hour to 12 hours. Whether a batch or continuous mode is used, the molar ratio of H2O2 to ketone can vary from 2:1 to 0.1:1 and preferably from 1:1 to 0.3:1. In a continuous mode, the catalyst can be<br>
used as a fixed bed, fluidized bed, moving bed, or any other configuration known to ono of ordinary skill in the art. When a fixed bed is used, the ketone and hydrogen peroxide can be flowed in either an upflow or downflow direction. The H2O2 and ketone can be injected separately or can be premixed and then injected into the reactor, Regardless of how the reactants are introduced and the type of bed .being used, the reactants are flowed through the reactor at a liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) of 0.05 to 10 hr"1 in order to insure adequate contact time between the reactants and the catalyst. Finally, regardless of whether a batch or continuous process is used, the products, reactants, an j any formed byproducts are separated by means well known in the art.<br>

In a container, 0.47 grams of SnCI4'5H2O were added to a solution containing 10 grams of an aqueous solution of cetyltrimethylammoriium hydroxide (CTAOH, 0.53M), 1.94 grams of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAIJr), 6.3 grams of tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAOH, 25 wt.°/c) and 16 grams of water. This mixture was heated at 40°C under gently stirring. 'Nhen a clear solution was obtained, it was cooled down to room temperature and then there were added 4 grams of silica (Aerosil 200™, Degussa). The reaction mixtu e was stirred for one hour. The final composition of the gel is described by the following formula:<br>
SiO2 : 0.08 CTAOH : 0.08 CTABr: 0.26 TMAOH : 0.02 SnO2 : 24 H2C<br>
The gel was loaded into a Teflon®-lined stainless steel autoclave and heated to 135°C for 24 hours. After this time, the product was recovered by filtration to give a product which contained silicon and tin.<br>
The occluded organic material was removed by heating the sample under nitrogen flow in a tubular reactor at 540°C for 1 hour and then in air at 54C°C for 6 hours. A portion of this sample was analyzed and showed that it conlained 3.9 wt.% tin.<br>

This product was identified as sample H.<br>
Example 10<br>
Samples A to H were tested for the selective oxidation of cyclohexanone to its corresponding lactone as follows. In a round bottomed flask, there were added 3 g of methyl t-butyl ether as a solvent along with one mmol of ketono and a sligit molecular excess of hydrogen peroxide (about 1.5 to 2.0 equivalents). Finaly 50 mg of the catalyst to be tested was added and the flask was healed to 56°C. Samples were removed at 1 hour, 3.5 hours, and 6 hours to determine the conversion and selectivity to the corresponding lactone. The activity and selectivity of various catalysts for the conversion of cyclohexanone are presented in Table 1.<br>
