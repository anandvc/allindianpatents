				<td>A MCM-22 FAMILY MOLECULAR SIEVE COMPOSITION. ITS METHOD OF MAKING, AND USE FOR HYDROCARBON CONVERSIONS<br>
FIELD<br>
[0001] This invention relates to a novel MCM-22 tamily molecular sieve composition, a method of making thereof and the use thereof lor hydrocarbon conversions. In particular, this invention relates to a novel MCM-22 family molecular sie\e composition comprising greater than 50 wt% of the molecular sieve having a crystal diameter greater than 1 Jm as measured by the SEM, a method of making thereof and the use thereot tor hydrocarbon conversions BACKGROUND OF THIS DISCLOSURE<br>
[0002] Molecular sieve materials, both natural and synthetic, have been demonstrated in the past to have catalytic properties for various types ol hydrocarbon conv ersion. Certain molecular sieves, zeolites, AlPOs, mesoporous materials, are ordered, porous crystalline materials having a definite crystalline structure as determined by X-ray difiraction (XRD). 'Within the crystalline molecular sieve material there are a large number of cavities which may be interconnected by a number of channels or pores. These cavities and pores are uniform in size within a specific molecular sieve material Because the dimensions ot these pores are such as to accept for adsorption molecules of certain dimensions while rejecting those ot larger dimensions, these materials have come to be known as "'molecular sieves" and are utilized in a variety ot industrial processes.<br>
[0003] Such molecular sieves, both natural and synthetic, include a wide variety of positive ion-containing crystalline silicates These silicates can be described as rigid three-dimensional framework of S1O4 and Periodic Table Group 13 element oxide (e.g . A1O4) I he tetrahedra are cross-linked by the sharing of oxygen atoms whereby the ratio of the total Group 13 element (e.g., aluminum) and silicon atoms to oxygen atoms is 1 2. The electrovalence of the tetrahedra containing the Group 13 element (e.g , aluminum) is balanced by the inclusion in the crystal of a cation, for example a proton, an alkali metal or an alkaline earth metal cation. This can be expressed wherein the ratio ot the Group 13 element (e g , aluminum) to the number ot various cations, such as H+, Ca2+/2, Sr2+/2, Na , K + . or 111. is equal to unity<br>
[0004] Molecular sieves that find application in catalysis include any of the naturally occurring or synthetic crystalline molecular sieves Examples ot these zeolites include large pore zeolites, intermediate pore size zeolites, and small pore zeolites I hese zeolites and their isotypes are described in "Atlas of Zeolite Framework Types', eds. W H Meier, D. H Olson and Ch. Baerlocher, Elsevier, Fifth Edition, 2001, which is hereby incorporated by reference A large pore zeolite generally has a pore size of at least about 7 A and includes LIE, VF1, MAZ, FAU,<br><br>
OFF, *BEA, and MOR framework type zeolites (IUPAC Commission of Zeolite Nomenclature). Examples of large pore zeolites include mazzite. offretite. zeolite L. VPI-5. zeolite Y, zeolite X, omega, and Beta. An intermediate pore size zeolite generally has a pore size from about 5 A to less than about 7 A and includes, for example. MFI. MEL. EUO. Mil. MFS, AEL. AFO, HEU, FER, MWW, and TON framework type zeolites (IUPAC Commission of Zeolite Nomenclature). Examples of intermediate pore size zeolites include ZSM-5. ZSM-11, ZSM-22, MCM-22, sihcalite 1, and silicalite 2 A small pore size zeolite has a pore size from about 3 A to less than about 5.0 A and includes, for example, CHA, ERI, KM, LEV. SOD, and LTA framework type zeolites (IUPAC Commission of Zeolite Nomenclature) Examples of small pore zeolites include ZK-4, ZSM-2, SAPO-34, SAPO-35, ZK-14, SAPO-42. ZK.-21. ZK-22. ZK-5. ZK-20. zeolite A, chabazite, zeolite T, gmehmte, ALPO-17. and clmoptilolite<br>
[0005] U.S. Patent No. 4,439.409 refers to a crystalline moleculai sieve composition of matter named PSH-3 and its synthesis from a hydrothermal reaction mixture containing hexamethyleneimme, an organic compound which acts as directing agent tor synthesis of the MCM-56 (U S. Patent No. 5,362.697). Hexamethyleneimme is also taught tor use in synthesis of crystalline molecular sieves MCM-22 (U.S Patent No 4,954.325) and MCM-49 (U S. Patent No. 5,236,575). A molecular sieve composition of matter referred to as zeolite SSZ-25 (U.S Patent No. 4,826,667) is synthesized from a hydrothermal reaction mixture containing an adamantane quaternary ammonium ion. U.S. Patent No 6,077,498 refers to a crystalline molecular sieve composition of matter named ITQ-1 and its synthesis from a hydrothermal reaction mixture containing one or a plurality ol organic additives<br>
[0006) The term "MCM-22 family material" (or material ot the MCM-22 family" or 'molecular sieve of the MCM-22 family"*), as used herein, includes<br>
(i) molecular sieves made from a common first degree crystalline building block "unit cell having the MWW framework topology ' \ unit cell is a spatial arrangement of atoms which is tiled in three-dimensional space to describe the crystal as described in the "Atlas of Zeolite Framework Types", Fifth edition. 2001. the entire content of which is incorporated as reference, (ii) molecular sieves made from a common second degree building block, a 2-dimensional tiling of such MWW framework type unit cells, forming a "monolayer of one unit cell thickness", preferably one c-unit cell thickness, (iii) molecular sieves made from common second degree building blocks, "layers of one or more than one unit cell thickness", wherein the layer of more than one unit cell thickness is made from stacking, packing, or binding at least two monolayers of one unit cell thick of unit cells having the MWW framework topology. The stacking of such second degree<br>
building blocks can be in a regular fashion, an irregular tashion, a random fashion, or any<br>
combination thereof, or (iv)      molecular sieves made by  any regular or random 2-dimensional or 3-dimensional<br>
combination of unit cells having the MWW framework topology<br>
The MCM-22 family materials are characterized by having an X-ray diffraction pattern including d-spacing maxima at 12.4±0.25, 3 57^0.07 and 3.42±0 07 Angstroms (either calcined or as-synthesized). The MCM-22 family materials may also be characterized by having an X-ray diffraction pattern including d-spacing maxima at 12.4±0 25, 6 9±0.15. 3 57±0.O7 and 3.42±0.07 Angstroms (either calcined or as-synthesized) The X-ray diffraction data used to characterize the molecular sieve are obtained by standard techniques using the K-alpha doublet of copper as the incident radiation and a diffractometer equipped with a scintillation counter and associated computer as the collection system Materials belong to the MCM-22 family include MCM-22 (described in U S. Pat. No. 4,954,325), PSH-3 (described in I S Pat No 4.439,409), SSZ-25 (described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,826,667). ERB-1 (described in European Patent No. 0293032), ITQ-1 (described in US Pat. No. 6.077. 498). ITQ-2 (described in International Patent Publication No. WO97/17290). ITQ-30 (described in International Patent Publication No. WO2005118476), MCM-36 (described ml S Pat No 5,250,277). MCM-49 (described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,236,575) and MCM-56 (described in V S Pat No 5,362.697) 1 he entire contents of the patents are incorporated herein by reference<br>
[0007] It is to be appreciated the MCM-22 family molecular sieves described above are distinguished from conventional large pore zeolite alkylation catalysts, such as mordenite. in that the MCM-22 materials have 12-ring surface pockets which do not communicate with the 10-nng internal pore system of the molecular sieve<br>
[0008] The zeohtic materials designated by the IZA-SC as being of the MWW topology are multi-layered materials which have two pore systems arising from the presence of both 10 and 12 membered rings The Atlas of Zeolite Framework Types classes five differently named materials as having this same topology. MCM-22. ERB-1. 11Q-1, PSH-3, and SSZ-25 [0009] The MCM-22 family molecular sieves have been found to be useful in a variety of hydrocarbon conversion processes. Examples of MCM-22 family molecular sieve are MCM-22, MCM-49, MCM-56. ITQ-1. PSH-3, SSZ-25. and ERB-1 Such molecular sieves are useful for alkylation of aromatic compounds. For example, U S Patent No 6.936.744 discloses a process for producing a monoalkylated aromatic compound, particularly cumene. comprising the step of contacting a polyalkylated aromatic compound with an alkylatable aromatic compound under at least partial liquid phase conditions and in the presence of a transalky lation catalyst to produce the monoalkylated aromatic compound, wherein the transalky lation catalyst comprises a mixture<br>
of at least two different crystalline molecular sieves, wherein each of the molecular sieves is<br>
selected from zeolite beta, zeolite Y, mordenite and a material having an X-ray diffraction pattern<br>
including d-spacing maxima at 12 4±0.25, 6 9±0 15,35 7±0.07 and 3.42±Q.07 Angstroms<br>
[0010]      It is known that crystal morphology, size and aggregation/agglomeriation can affect<br>
catalyst behavior, especially regarding catalyst activity and stability   There is, therefore, a need<br>
for novel crystalline molecular sieve compositions and method of making such novel crystalline<br>
molecular sieve compositions,, especially molecular sieves of different morphology<br>

material(s)" used herein means the MCM-22 family material ot this disclosure preferably<br>
contains a minor proportion (less than 50 wt%), preferably less than 20 wt%. of non-MCM-22<br>
family materials ('"impurities"') in the MCM-22 family materials, which weight percent (wt%)<br>
values are based on the combined weight of impurities and  pure  phase MCM-22 family<br>
materials<br>
[0037]      The MCM-22 crystalline material has a composition involving the molar relationship:<br>
X203:(n)YG2,<br>
wherein X is a trivalent element, such as aluminum, boron, iron and/or gallium, preferably<br>
aluminum, Y is a tetravalent element such as silicon and/or germanium, preferably silicon, and n<br>
is at least about 10, usually from about 10 to about 150, more usually trom about 10 to about 60,<br>
and even more usually from about 20 to about 40   In the as-synthesized form, the material<br>

components are associated with the material as a result of their presence during synthesis, and are<br>
typically removed by post-synthesis methods well known to those skilled in the art and/or<br>
hereinafter more particularly described<br>
[0038]      It   is   to   be   understood   that   throughoul    this   detailed    description,   common<br>
characterization techniques were used to describe molecular sieve materials   These common<br>
techniques included ascertaining.<br>
(a)	structure and the degree of crystallinity of the molecular sieve material by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD).<br>
(b)	morphology  and crystal  size  of the  molecular  sieve  material  measured by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM):<br>
(c)	chemical  composition  by   atomic  absorption  spectrometry   and/or  Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS or 1CPMS);<br>

(e)	catalytic activities and catalytic stabilities measured by probing reactions<br>
X-Ray Powder Diffraction Pattern of Known MCM-22<br>
[0039] The MCM-22 crystalline materials may be distinguished trom other crystalline materials by the X-ray diffraction pattern.<br>
[0040] The interplanar spacings, d's. were calculated in Angstrom units (A), and the relative intensities of the lines, I/I0, where the intensity of the strongest line above background, I0, is counted as 100, were derived with the use of a profile fitting routine (or second derivative algorithm) The intensities are uncorrected for Lorentz and polarization effects The relative intensities are given in terms of the symbols VS=\ery strong (greater than 60 to 100). S=strong (greater than 40 to 60). M=medium (greater than 20 to 40) and W=weak (0 to 20). It should be understood that diffraction data listed as single lines may consist ot multiple overlapping lines which under certain conditions, such as differences in cry stallographic changes, may appear as resolved or partially resolved lines. Typically, cry stallographic changes can include minor changes in unit cell parameters and/or a change in crystal symmetry, without a change in the structure. These minor effects, including changes in relative intensities, can also occur as a result of differences in cation content, framework composition, nature and degree of pore filling, and thermal and/or hydrothermal history Other changes m diffraction patterns can be indicative of important differences between materials, which is the case for comparing MCM-22 with similar materials, e.g., MCM-49, MCM-56. and PSH-3<br>
[0041] It should be understood that this X-ray diffraction pattern is characteristic of all the species of the present crystalline composition The sodium form as well as other cationic forms reveal substantially the same pattern with some minor shifts in interplanar spacing and variation in relative intensity. Other minor variations can occui. depending on the Y to X. e g . silicon to aluminum, ratio of the particular sample, as well as its degree of thermal treatment (e g , calcination)<br>
[0042] In its as-synthesized form, the known MCM-22 crystalline material has an X-ray diffraction pattern which is distinguished from the patterns ot other known crystalline materials by the lines listed in Table I below.<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>

Surface Areas and Adsorption Uptake<br>
[0047] The overall surface area of a molecular sieve may be measured by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method using adsorption-desorption of nitrogen (temperature of liquid nitrogen, 77 K). The internal surface area may be calculated using t-plot of the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) measurement. The external surface area is calculated by subtracting the internal surface area from the overall surface area measured b&gt; the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) measurement.<br>
[0048]      The   crystalline   molecular   sieve   (after   calcination)   of this   disclosure   may   be characterized by a preferred total surface area (sum of the external and the internal surface areas, as measured by the BET method) of greater than 450 m2/g. more preferably greater than 475 m2/g, more preferably greater than 500 m2/g. and more preterabh greater than 600 m~/g. Formulation of the Hydrofhermal Reaction Mixtures<br>
[0049] Synthetic molecular sieves are often prepared from aqueous hydrofhermal reaction mixtures (synthesis mixture(s) or synthetic gel(s)) comprising sources ot appropriate oxides. Organic directing agents may also be included in the hydrothermal reaction mixture for the purpose of influencing the production of a molecular sieve having the desired structure. The use of such directing agents is discussed in an article by Lok et al. entitled '"lhe Role of Organic Molecules in Molecular Sieve Synthesis*" appearing in Zeolites, Vol 3. October, 1983, pp. 282-291<br>
[0050] After the components of the hydrothermal reaction mixture are properly mixed with one another,  the hydrothermal  reaction  mixture  is  subjected to  appropriate  crystallization<br>
conditions. Such conditions usually involve heating of the hydrothermal reaction mixture to an elevated temperature possibly with stirring Room temperature aging of the hydrothermal reaction mixture is also desirable in some instances<br>
[0051] After the crystallization of the hvdrothermal reaction mixture is complete, the crystalline product may be recovered from the remainder of the hydrothermal reaction mixture, especially the liquid contents thereof. Such recover} may involve filtering the crystals and washing these crystals with water However, in order to remove the entire undesired residue of the hydrothermal reaction mixture from the crystals, it is often necessary to subject the crystals to a high temperature calcination e.g., at 500°C. possibl} in the presence of oxygen Such a calcination treatment not only removes water from the crystals, but this treatment also serves to decompose and/or oxidize the residue of the organic directing agent which may be occluded in the pores of the crystals, possibly occupying ion exchange sites therein<br>

The hydrothermal reaction mixture can be prepared either batchwise or continuously Crystal size and crystallization time ol the crystalline molecular sieve of this disclosure may vary with the nature of the hydrothermal leaction mixture employed and the crystallization conditions<br>
[0066] It will be understood by a person skilled in the art that the synthesis mixture having a composition within the molar ranges as discussed above means that the synthesis mixture is the product of mixing, adding, reacting, or by any means of providing such a mixture, wherein such product has a composition within the molar ranges as discussed above The product of mixing, adding, reacting, or by any means of providing such a mixture may or may not contain individual ingredients when the synthesis mixture was prepared.

type. In some embodiments of this disclosure, the synthesis ol the crystalline molecular sieve is<br>
facilitated by the presence of 0 to about 25 wt%, preferably about 1 to about 5 wt%. seed crystals<br>

Catalysis and Adsorption<br>
[0074] A summary of the molecular sieves and/or zeolites, in terms of production, modification and characterization of molecular sieves, is described in the book "Molecular Sieves - Principles of Synthesis and Identification", (R Szostak. Blackie Academic &amp; Professional, London, 1998, Second Edition! In addition to molecular sieves, amorphous materials, chiefly silica, aluminum silicate and aluminum oxide, have been used as adsorbents and catalyst supports. A number of long-known forming techniques, like spray drying, prilling, pelletizing and extrusion, have been and are being used to produce macrostructures in the form of, for example, spherical particles, extrudates. pellets and Tablets of both micropores and other types of porous materials for use in catalysis, adsorption and ion exchange. A summary of these techniques is described in "'Catalyst Manufacture," A B Stiles and 1 A Koch, Marcel Dekker, New York, 1995<br>
[0075] To the extent desired, the original metal cations of the as-synthesized material can be replaced in accordance with techniques well known in the art, at least in part, by ion exchange with other cations. Preferred replacing cations include metal ions, hydrogen ions, hydrogen precursor, e.g., ammonium, ions and mixtures thereof Particular!} preferred cations are those which tailor the catalytic activity for certain hydrocarbon conversion reactions These include hydrogen, rare earth metals and metals of Groups 1-17. preferably Groups 2-12 of the Periodic Table of the Elements<br>
[0076] The crystalline molecular sieve of this disclosure, preferably the MCM-22 family molecular sieve, when employed either as an adsorbent or as a catalyst in an organic compound conversion process should be generally dehydrated, at least partially This can be done by heating to a temperature in the range of e.g, 200°C to 595°C in an atmosphere such as air or nitrogen, and at atmospheric, sub-atmospheric or super-atmospheric pressures for e g.. between 30 minutes and 48 hours. The degree of dehydration is measured by the percentage of weight loss relative to the total weight loss of a molecular sieve sample at 595°C under flowing dry nitrogen (less than 0.001 kPa partial pressure of water vapor) for 48 hours Dehydration can also be performed at<br>
room temperature (~25°C) merely by placing the silicate in a vacuum, but a longer time is required to obtain a sufficient amount of dehydration.<br>
[0077] When used as a catalyst, the crystalline molecular sieve of this disclosure, preferably the MCM-22 family molecular sieve, should be generally subjected to thermal treatment to remove part or all of any organic constituent I he crystalline molecular sieve of this disclosure, preferably the MCM-22 family molecular sieve, can also be used as a catalyst in intimate combination with a hydrogenating component such as tungsten, vanadium, molybdenum, rhenium, nickel, cobalt, chromium, manganese, or a noble metal such as platinum or palladium where a hydrogenation-dehydrogenation function is to be performed Such component can be in the composition by way of co-crystalhzation, exchanged into the composition to the extent a Group 13 element, e.g., aluminum, is in the structure, impregnated therein or intimately physically admixed therewith. Such component can be impregnated in or on to it such as. for example, by, in the case of platinum, treating the silicate with a solution containing a platinum metal-containing ion. Thus, suitable platinum compounds for this purpose include chloroplatinic acid, platinous chloride and various compounds containing the platinum amine complex [0078] The crystalline MCM-22 family molecular sieve of this disclosure, especially in its metal, hydrogen and ammonium forms can be beneficially converted to another form by thermal treatment. This thermal treatment is generally performed by heating one of these forms at a temperature of at least 370°C for at least 1 minute and generally not longer than 1000 hours. While sub-atmospheric pressure can be employed for the thermal treatment, atmospheric pressure is desired foi reasons of convenience. The thermal treatment can be performed at a temperature up to about 925°C The thermal treated product is particularly useful in the catalysis of certain hydrocarbon conversion reactions. The thermally treated product, especially in its metal, hydrogen and ammonium forms, is particularly useful in the catalysis of certain organic, e.g., hydrocarbon, conversion reactions. Non-limiting examples of such reactions include those described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4.954,325; 4,973.784; 4.992,611. 4,^56.514; 4,962,250, 4,982,033; 4,962,257; 4,962,256; 4,992,606; 4,954,663, 4,992.615; 4.983.276; 4,982,040; 4.962,239; 4,968,402, 5,000,839, 5,001,296, 4.986.894. 5.001.295; 5.001.283, 5,012,033; 5,019,670; 5,019,665; 5.019,664; and 5,013.422. each incorporated herein bv reference as to the description of the catalytic reactions<br>
[0079] The crystals prepared bv the instant invention can be shaped into a wide variety of particle sizes. Generally speaking, the particles can be in the form ot a powder, a granule, or a molded product, such as an extrudate. In cases where the catalyst is molded, such as by extrusion, the crystals can be extruded before drying or partially dried and then extruded<br>

Such materials include active and inactive materials and synthetic or naturally occurring zeolites as well as inorganic materials such as clays, silica and/or metal oxides such as alumina. The latter may be either naturally occurring or in the form of gelatinous precipitates or gels including mixtures of silica and metal oxides Use of a material in conjunction with the new crystal, i.e. combined therewith or present during synthesis ot the new crystal, which is active, tends to change the conversion and/or selectivity of the catalyst in certain organic conversion processes Inactive materials suitably serve as diluents to control the amount of conversion in a given process so that products can be obtained economically and orderly without employing other means for controlling the rate of reaction These materials may be incorporated into naturally occurring clays, e.g., bentonite and kaolin, to improve the crush strength of the catalyst under commercial operating conditions. The materials, 1 e clay s. oxides, etc . function as binders for the catalyst. It is desirable to provide a catalyst having good crush strength because in commercial use it is desirable to prevent the catalyst from breaking down into powder-like materials. These clay binders have been employed normally only tor the purpose of improving the crush strength of the catalyst.<br>
[0086] Naturally occurring clays which can be composited with the new crystal include the montmorillonite and kaolin family, which families include the subbentonites, and the kaolins<br>
commonly known as Dixie, McNamee, Georgia and Florida cla&gt;s or others in which the main<br>
mineral constituent is halloysite. kaolinite, dictite. narcite, or anauxile Such clays can be used in<br>
the raw state as originally mined or initially subjected to calcination, acid treatment or chemical<br>
modification. Binders useful for compositing with the present enstal also include inorganic<br>
oxides, notably alumina<br>
[0087]      In addition to the foregoing materials, the new crystal can be composited with a porous<br>
matrix material such as silica-alumina, silica-magnesia,  sihca-zirconia.  silica-thoria, silica-<br>
beryllia, silica-titania as well as ternary  compositions such as sihca-alumina-thona, silica-<br>
alumina-zirconia silica-alumina-magnesia and silica-magnesia-zircoma<br>
[0088]      The relative proportions of finely divided crystalline molecular sieve and inorganic<br>
oxide matrix vary widely, with the crystal content ranging from about 1 to about 99 percent by<br>
weight and more usually, particularly when the composite is prepared in the form of beads, in the<br>
range of about 20 to about 80 wt% of the composite<br>
[0089]      These and other facets of the present invention is exemplified by the Following<br>
Examples.<br>
