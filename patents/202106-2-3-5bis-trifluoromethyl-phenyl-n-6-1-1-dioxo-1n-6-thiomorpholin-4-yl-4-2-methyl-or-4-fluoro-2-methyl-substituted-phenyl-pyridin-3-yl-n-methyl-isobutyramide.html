The invention relates to a compound of formula<br>
wherein <br>
R    is hydrogen or fluoro; and to their pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof. Specifically, the invention relates to the following compounds:<br>
2-(3,5-bis-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-N-[6-(l,l-dioxo-l,6-thiomorpholin-4-yl)-4-o-tolyl-pyridin-3-yl]-N-methyl-isobutyramideand<br>
2-(3,5-bis-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-N-[6-(l,l-dioxo-l}.Â°-thiomorpholin-4-yl)-4-(4-fluoro-2-methyl-phenyl)-pyridin-3-yl]-N-methyl-isobutyramide.<br>
These two compounds are novel. They have been described generically in EP 1035115.<br>
The compounds of formula I and their salts are characterized by valuable therapeutic properties. It has been found that the compounds of the present invention are highly selective antagonists of the Neurokinin 1 (NK-1, substance P) receptor. Substance P is a naturally occurring undecapeptide belonging to the tachykinin family of peptides, the latter being so-named because of their prompt contractile action on extravascular smooth muscle tissue.<br>
The receptor for substance P is a member of the superfamily of G protein-coupled<br><br>
receptors.<br>
The neuropeptide receptor for substance P (NK-1) is widely distributed throughout the mammalian nervous system (especially brain and spinal ganglia), the circulatory system and peripheral tissues (especially the duodenum and jejunum) and are involved in regulating a number of diverse biological processes.<br>
The central and peripheral actions of the mammalian tachykinin substance P have been associated with numerous inflammatory conditions including migraine, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and inflammatory bowel disease as well as mediation of the emetic reflex and the modulation of central nervous system (CNS) disorders such as Parkinson's disease (Neurosci. Res., 1996, 7,187-214), anxiety (Can. J. Phys., 1997, 75, 612-621) and depression (Science, 1998,281, 1640-1645).<br>
Evidence for the usefulness of tachykinin receptor antagonists in pain, headache, especially migraine, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, attenuation of morphine withdrawal, cardiovascular changes, oedema, such as oedema caused by thermal injury, chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma/bronchial hyperreactivity and other respiratory diseases including allergic rhinitis, inflammatory diseases of the gut including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, ocular injury and ocular inflammatory diseases has been reviewed in "Tachykinin Receptor and Tachykinin Receptor Antagonists", J. Auton. Pharmacol., 13, 23-93, 1993.<br>
Furthermore, Neurokinin 1 receptor antagonists are being developed for the treatment of a number of physiological disorders associated with an excess or imbalance of tachykinin, in particular substance P. Examples of conditions in which siibstance P has been implicated include disorders of the central nervous system such as anxiety, depression and psychosis (WO 95/16679, WO 95/18124 and WO 95/23798).<br>
The neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists are further useful for the treatment of motion sickness and for treatment induced vomiting.<br>
In addition, in The New England Journal of Medicine, Vol. 340, No. 3, 190-195, 1999 has been described the reduction of cisplatin-induced emesis by a selective neurokinin-1-receptor antagonist.<br>
The usefulness of neurokinin 1 receptor antagonists for the treatment of certain forms of urinary incontinence is further described in Neuropeptides, 32(1), 1-49, (1998) and Eur. J. Pharmacol., 383(3), 297-303, (1999).<br>
Furthermore, US 5,972,938 describes a method for treating a psychoimmunologic or a psychosomatic disorder by administration of a tachykinin receptor, such as NK-1 receptor antagonist.<br>
Life Sci., (2000), 67(9), 985-1001 describes, that astrocytes express functional<br><br>
receptors to numerous neurotransmitters including substance P, which is an important stimulus for reactive astrocytes in CNS development, infection and injury. In brain tumors malignant glial cells originating from astrocytes are triggered by tachykinins via NK-1 receptors to release soluble mediators and to increase their proliferative rate. Therefore, selective NK-1 receptor antagonists may be useful as a therapeutic approach to treat malignant gliomas in the treatment of cancer.<br>
In Nature (London) (2000), 405(6783), 180-183 is described that mice with a genetic disruption of NK-1 receptor show a loss of the rewarding properties of morphine. Consequently NK-1 receptor antagonists may be useful in the treatment of withdrawel symptoms of addictive drugs such as opiates and nicotine and reduction of their abuse/craving.<br>
NK1 receptor antagonists have been reported to have also a beneficial effect in the therapy of traumatic brain injury (oral disclosure by Prof. Nimmoat the International Tachykinin Conference 2000 in La Grande Motte, France, October 17-20, 2000 with the title "Neurokinin 1 (NK-1) Receptor Antagonists Improve the Neurological Outcome Following Traumatic Brain Injury" (Authors; A.). Nimmo, C.J. Bennett, X.Hu, I. Cernak, R.Vink).<br>
The compounds of the present invention are further useful for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)&gt; which is common in older men. BPH can be progressive and lead to urinary retention, infections, bladder calculi and renal failure. This indication has been reported in EP 01109853.0.<br>
The compounds of formula I can also be used in the form of their prodrugs, for example in form of their N-oxides. The prodrugs may add to the value of(the present compounds advantages in adsorption, pharmacokinetics in distribution and transport to the brain.<br>
Objects of the present invention are the compounds of formula I and pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts thereof, the preparation of the above-mentioned compounds, medicaments containing these compounds and their manufacture as well as the use of the above-mentioned compounds in the control or prevention of illnesses, especially of illnesses and disorders of the kind referred to earlier or in the manufacture of corresponding medicaments.<br>
The most preferred indications in accordance with the present invention are those, which include disorders of the central nervous system, for example the treatment or prevention of certain depressive disorders, anxiety or emesisby the administration of the NK-1 receptor antagonist. A major depressive episode has been defined as being a period of at least two weeks during which, for most of the day and nearly every day, there is either depressed mood or the loss of interest or pleasure in all, or nearly all activities.<br>
As described therein, the term "pharmaceutical^ acceptable acid addition salts" embraces salts with inorganic and organic acids, such as hydrochloric acid, nitric acid,<br><br>
sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, citric acid, formic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, acetic acid, succinic acid, tartaric acid, methanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid and the like.<br>
The present compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutical!/ acceptable salts can be prepared by methods known in the art, for example, by a processes described below, which process comprises<br>
a)       reacting the compound of formula<br>

The salt formation is effected at room temperature in accordance with methods which are known perse and which are familiar to any person skilled in the art. Not only salts with inorganic acids, but also salts with organic acids are possible. Hydrochlorides, hydrobromides, sulphates, nitrates, citrates, acetates, maleates, succinates, methanesulphonates, p-toluenesulphonntes and the like are examples of such salts.<br>
The following scheme and examples 1 and 2 describe the processes for the preparation of the compounds of formula I in more detail. The starting materials of formulae III, IV, VIII and XII are known compounds or may be prepared according to methods known in the art.<br>
In the schemes the following abbreviations have been used:<br>

As mentioned earlier, the compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically usable addition salts possess valuable pharmacological properties. It has been found that the compounds of the present invention are antagonists of the Neurokinin 1 (NK-1, substance P) receptor.<br>
The compounds of formula I were investigated in accordance with the tests given hereinafter.<br><br>
The affinities of the compounds 2-(3l5-bis-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-N-f6-(l,l-dioxo-R6-thiomorpholin-4-yl)-4-^<br>
(3)5-bis-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-N-[6-(ia-dioXo-lX6-thiomorpholin-4-yl)-4-(4-fluoro-2^ methyl-phenyl)-pyridin-3-yl]-N-methyl-isobutyramide for the human N*M receptor were evaluated in CHO cells infected with the human NK| receptor (using the Semliki virus expression system) and radiolabeled with [' H]substance P (final concentration 0.6 nM). Binding assays were performed in HEPES buffer (50 mM, pH 7.4) containing BSA (0.04 %), leupeptin (8 |_ig / ml), MnCh (3mM) and phosphoramidon (2 ^.iM). Binding assays consisted of 250 ^tl of membrane suspension (1.25xl05 cells / assay tube), 0.125 |.il ofbuffer of displacing agent and 125 |-il of ['H]substance P. Displacement curves were determined with at least seven concentrations of the compound. The assay tubes were incubated for 60 min at room temperature after which time the tube contents were rapidly filtered under vacuum through GF/C filters presoaked for 60 itiin with PE1 (0.3 %) with 2 x 2 ml washes of HEPES buffer (50 mM, pH 7.4). The radioactivity retained on the filters was measured by scintillation counting. All assays were performed in triplicate in at least 2 separate experiments.<br>
The compounds 2-(3,5-bis-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-N-[6-(l,l-dioxo-lX.6-thiomorpholin-4-yl)-4-o-tolyl-pyridin-3-yl]-N-methyl-isobutyramide and 2-(3,5-bis-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-N-[6-(l,l-dioxo-l&gt;v.6-thiomorpholin-4-yl)-4-(4-fluoro-2-methyl-phenyl)-pyridin-3-yl]-N-methyl-isobutyramide are potent and selective ligands for recombinant human NKi receptors expressed in CHO cells. They have affinities (pKi) of (S.9 and 9.5 for the human NKi receptor, repectively and over 3 orders of magnitude of selectivity for the NK| receptor compared to other neurokinin receptors.<br>
The activity in vitro was examined by studying its effect on substance P induced Ca'+ influxes in CHO cells expressing the recombinant human NKi receptor. In these cells, substance P causes a concentration dependent influx of Cafc+ which can be measured using FLIPR technology. Increasing concentrations of either 2-(3,5-bis-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-<br>
N-[6-(l,l-dioxo-lX.r,-thiomorpholin-4-yl)-4-o-tolyl-pyridin-3-yl]-N-methyl-<br>
isobutyramide or 2-(3,5-bis-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-N-[6-(l,l-dioxo-l?t6-thiomorpholin-4-yl)-4-(4-fluoro-2-methyl-phenyl)-pyridin-3-yl]-N-methyl-isobutyramide inhibited the substance P induced Ca2+ influx. These data irjdicate that both compounds are antagonists at human NKt receptors.<br>
In vjVo2-(3)5-bis-trifluoromethyl-phenyJ)-N-[6-(l,l-dioxo-lX6-thiomorpholin-4-yl)-4-o-tolyl-pyridin-3-yl]-N-methyl-isobutyr|imide antagonises foot-tapping behaviour induced in Gerbils with intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injections of an NKi receptor agonist. The dose for this compound calculated to inhibit 50 % of the foot-tapping<br><br>
behaviour following oral administration was 0,8 mg/kg. The plasma levels required to completely antagonise this behaviour have also been measured and it was found that a total plasma concentration of 10 ng/ml is required to completely block the foot-tapping behaviour. Similarly, 2-(3,5-bis-trifluoromethyl-phenyI)-N-[6-( 1,1 -dioxo-lX6-thiomorpholin-4-yl)-4-(4-fluoro-2-methyl-phenyl)-pyridin-3-yl]-N-methyl-isobutyramide also antagonised NKi agonist-induced foot-tapping in Gerbils. The dose for this compound calculated to inhibit 50 % of the foot-tapping behaviour following oral administration was 0.1 mg/kg. The total plasma levels that are required to completely antagonise this behaviour are less than 10 ng/ml.<br>
Therefore, in conclusion, both 2-(3,5-bis-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-N-[6-(l)l-dioxo-lA,6-thiomorpholin-4-yl)-4-o-tolyl-pyridin-3-yl]-N-methyl-isobutyramideand2-<br>
(3,5-bis-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-N-[6-(l&gt;l-dioxo-R(l-thiomorpholin-4-yl)-4-(4-fluoro-2-methyl-phenyl)-pyridin-3-yl)-N-methyl-isobutyramide are potent antagonists of NKi induced behaviours in the Gerbil.<br>
The pharmacokinetic parameters of both compounds have been evaluated in both<br>
rats and dogs. In rats, 2-(3)5-bis-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-N-[6-(l,l-dioxo-lX6-<br>
thiomorpholin-4-yl)-4-o-tolyl-pyridin-3-yl]-lNl-methyl-isobutyramide has a terminal half-<br>
life of 9 hours, a clearance of 4.7 ml/min/kg, a volume of distribution of 41/kg and an oral<br>
bioavailability of 18 %. In dogs the molecule had a half-life of 8 hours, a clearance of 5<br>
ml/min/kg and a volume of distribution of 4 1/kg. Similarly, in rats 2-(3,5-bis-<br>
trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-N-[6-(l,l-dioxo-lX6-thiomorpholin-4-yl)-4-(4-fluoro-2-methyl-<br>
phenyl)-pyridin-3-yl]-N-methyl-isobutyramide has a terminal half-life dF21 hours, a	-<br>
clearance of 0.3-1.2 ml/min/kg, a volume of distribution of 0.7 1/kg and an oral bioavailability of 61 %. In dogs the molecule had a half-life of 56 hours, a clearance of 1.4 ml/min/kg and a volume of distribution of 1.5 1/kg.<br>
The compounds of formula I as well as their pharmaceutically usable acid addition salts can be used as medicaments, e.g. in the form of pharmaceutical preparations. The pharmaceutical preparations can be administered orally, e.g. in the form of tablets, coated tablets, dragees, hard and soft gelatine capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions. The administration can, however, also be effected rectally, e.g. in the form of suppositories, or parenterally, e.g. in the form of injection solutions.<br>
The compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically usable acid addition salts can be processed with pharmaceutically inert,! inorganic or organic excipients for the production of tablets, coated tablets, dragees land hard gelatine capsules. Lactose, corn starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid fc&gt;r its salts etc can be used as such excipients e.g. for tablets, dragees and hard gelatine capsules.<br><br>
Suitable excipients for soft gelatine capsules are e.g. vegetable oils, waxes, fats, semisolid and liquid polyols etc.<br>
Suitable excipients for the manufacture of solutions and syrups are e.g. water, polyols, saccharose, invert sugar, glucose etc.<br>
