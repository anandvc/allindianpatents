The    present    invention    relates    to   new    substituted    n-benzoyl-n-(tetrazolylphenyl)-ureas.<br>
It has been disclosed that certain substituted N-(benzoyl)-N'-(heterocyclylphenyl)-ureas have insecticidal and acaricidal properties (cf., for example, DE-A 37 32 541, EP-A 0 242 322 or US 4,950,678). However, the action of these compounds is not always entirely satisfactory, in particular when low active compound concentrations and application rates are used.<br>
There have been found new substituted N-benzoyl-N'-(tetrazolylphenyl)-ureas of the formula (I)<br><br><br>
in which<br>
R1      represents halogen,<br>
R2       represents hydrogen or halogen,<br>
R3       represents halogen, alkyl or halogenoalkyl,<br>

The substances according to the invention can be employed particularly successfully for controlling plant-injurious insects, such as, for example, against tobacco bedworm (Heliothis virescens) caterpillars, mustard beetle (Phaedon cochleariae) larvae, diamond-backed moth (Plutella xylostella) caterpillars and fall army worm (Spodoptera exigua and Spodoptera frugioerda) caterpillars.<br>
If appropriate, the compounds according to the invention can also be used as herbicides and microbicides, for example as fungicides, antimycotics and bactericides, using specific concentrations/application rates. If appropriate, they can also be used as intermediates or precursors for the synthesis of further active compounds.<br>
All plant and plant parts can be treated in accordance with the invention. Plants in this context are taken to mean all plants and plant populations, such as desired and undesired wild plants or crop plants (including naturally occurring crop plants). Crop<br><br>
Le A 34 465-ForeiCT Countries<br>
plants can be plants which can be obtained by conventional breeding and optimization methods, or by biotechnological and genetic engineering methods, or by combinations of these methods, including the transgenic plants and including the plant varieties which are capable, or incapable, of being protected by Plant Breeders' Rights. Plant parts are to be taken to mean all aerial and subterranean parts and organs of the plants, such as shoot, leaf, flower and root, examples mentioned being leaves, needles, stalks, stems, flowers, fruit bodies, fruit and seeds, and also roots, tubers and rhizomes. The plant parts also include harvested material and vegetative and generative propagation material, for example cuttings, tubers, rhizomes, offshoots and seeds.<br>
Treatment according to the invention of the plants or plant parts with the active compounds is performed either directly or by exposure of the environment, habitat or store by the customary treatment methods, for example by dipping, spraying, releasing vapour, fogging, spreading, painting on, and, in the case of propagation material, in particular seeds, furthermore by coating with one or more coats.<br>
As already mentioned above, all plants and their parts can be treated in accordance with the invention. In a preferred embodiment, plant varieties and plant species which are either found wild or obtained by conventional biological breeding methods, such as hybridization or protoplast fusion, and the parts of these plant species and plant varieties are treated. In a further preferred embodiment, transgenic plants and plant varieties which have been obtained by genetic engineering methods, if appropriate in combination with conventional methods (Genetically Modified Organisms) and their parts are treated. The term "parts" or "parts of plants" or "plant parts" has been explained hereinabove.<br>
Plants which are treated in accordance with the invention are especially preferably plants of the plant varieties which are in each case commercially available or in current use. Plant varieties are to be understood as meaning plants with particular traits which have been obtained either by conventional breeding, by mutagenesis or<br><br>
Le A 34 465-Foreign Counfiies<br>
by recombinant DNA techniques. They may take the form of varieties, biotypes or genotypes.<br>
The treatment according to the invention may also result in superadditive ("synergistic") effects, depending on the plant species or plant varieties, their location and their growth conditions (soils, climate, vegetation period, nutrition). Thus, for example, reduced application rates and/or a widened spectrum of action and/or a more potent action of the substances and compositions which can be used according to the invention, better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to the salt content in water or soil, better flowering, facilitated harvesting, earlier ripening, higher yields, higher quality and/or higher nutritional value of the harvested products, better shelf life and/or processing of the harvested products are possible, with all these exceeding the effects actually to be expected.<br>
The preferred transgenic plants or plant varieties (which have been obtained by genetic engineering) to be treated in accordance with the invention include all plants which obtained, by this modification owing to genetic engineering, genetic material imparting to these plants especially advantageous valuable traits. Examples of such traits are better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to the salt content in water or soil, better flowering, facilitated harvesting, earlier ripening, higher yields, higher quality and/or higher nutritional value of the harvested products, better shelf life and/or processing of the harvested products. Other examples of such properties which are especially emphasized are an increased resistance of the plants to animal and microbial pests, such as to insects, mites, phytopathogenic fungi, bacteria and/or viruses, and an increased tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidal active compounds. Examples of transgenic plants which are mentioned are the important crop plants cereals (wheat, rice), maize, soya, potatoes, cotton, oilseed rape and fruit plants (with the fruits apples, pears, citrus fruit and grapes), with particular emphasis on maize, soya, potatoes, cotton and oilseed rape. Traits which are particularly emphasized are the<br><br>
Le A 34 465-ForekirCountries<br>
increased resistance of the plants to insects by toxins formed in the plants, in particular those which are generated in the plants by the genetic material from Bacillus thuringiensis (for example by the genes CrylA(a), CryIA(b), CryIA(c), CryllA, CrymA, CryIIIB2, Cry9c, Cry2Ab, CrySBb and CrylF and their combinations) ("Bt plants" hereinbelow). Traits which are also particularly emphasized are the increased resistance of plants to fungi, bacteria and viruses by systemic acquired resistance (SAR), systemin, phytoalexins, elicitors and resistance genes and correspondingly expressed proteins and toxins. Other traits which are particularly emphasized are the increased tolerance of the plants to specific herbicidal active compounds, for example imidazolinones, sulphonylureas, glyphosate or phosphinothricin (for example "PAT" gene). The genes imparting the desired traits in each case can also be present in the transgenic plants in combinations with each other. Examples of "Bt plants" which may be mentioned are maize varieties, cotton varieties, soya varieties and potato varieties which are sold under the trade names YIELD GARD® (for example maize, cotton, soya), KnockOut® (for example maize), StarLink® (for example maize), Bollgard® (cotton), Nucotn® (cotton) and NewLeaf® (potato). Examples of herbicide-tolerant plants which may be mentioned are maize varieties, cotton varieties, soya varieties which are sold under the trade names Roundup Ready® (tolerance to glyphosate, for example maize, cotton, soya), Liberty Link® (tolerance to phosphinotricin, for example oilseed rape), IMI® (tolerance to imidazolinones) and STS® (tolerance to sulphonylureas, for example maize). Other herbicide-resistant plants (bred conventionally for herbicide tolerance) which may be mentioned are also those varieties (for example maize) which are sold under the name Clearfield®. Naturally, these statements also apply to plant varieties which have these genetic traits, or genetic traits developed in the future, and which will be developed in the future or offered for sale in the future.<br>
The plants stated can be treated especially advantageously in accordance with the invention with the compounds of the formula (I). The preferred ranges stated hereinabove for the active compounds also apply to the treatment of these plants. The<br><br>
Le A 34 465-Foreim<br>
treatment of plants with the compounds mentioned specifically in the present text is particularly emphasized.<br>
The active compounds can be converted into the customary formulations such as solutions, emulsions, wettable powders, suspensions, powders, dusts, pastes, soluble powders, granules, suspoemulsion concentrates, natural and synthetic materials impregnated with active compound, and microencapsulations in polymeric materials.<br>
These formulations are produced in the known fashion, for example by mixing the active compounds with extenders, that is liquid solvents and/or solid carriers, optionally with the use of surfactants, that is to say emulsifiers and/or dispersants and/or foam formers.<br>
In the case of the use of water as extender, organic solvents can, for example, also be used as cosolvents. The following liquid solvents are essentially suitable: aromatics such as xylene, toluene or alkylnaphthalenes, chlorinated aromatic or chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as chlorobenzenes, chloroethylenes or methylene chloride, aliphatic hydrocarbons such as cyclohexane or paraffins, for example, mineral oil fractions, mineral and vegetable oils, alcohols such as butanol or glycol and their ethers and esters, ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone or cyclohexanone, strongly polar solvents such as dimethylformamide or dimethyl sulphoxide and water.<br>
Solid carriers which are suitable are:<br>
for example ammonium salts and ground natural minerals such as kaolins, clays, talc, chalk, attapulgite, montmorillonite or diatomaceous earth, and ground synthetic minerals such as highly disperse silica, alumina and silicates; suitable solid carriers for granules are: for example crushed and fractionated natural rocks such as calcite, marble, pumice, sepiolite and dolomite, or else synthetic granules of inorganic and organic meals, and granules of organic materials such as sawdust, coconut shells,<br><br>
Le A 34 465-Foreign Countrieg^<br>
maize stalks and tobacco stalks; suitable emulsifiers and/or foam foimers are: for example nonionic and anionic emulsifiers such as polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene fatty alcohol ethers, for example alkylaryl polyglycol ethers, alkylsulphonates, alkyl sulphates, arylsulphonates, or else protein hydrolysates; suitable dispersants are: for example lignin-sulphite waste liquors and methylcellulose.<br>
Adhesives such as carboxymethylcellulose, natural and synthetic polymers in the form of powders, granules or latices, such as gum arable, polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinyl acetate, or else natural phospholipids such as cephalins and lecithins and synthetic phospholipids can be used in the formulations. Other additives can be mineral and vegetable oils.<br>
It is possible to use colorants such as inorganic pigments, for example iron oxide, titanium oxide and Prussian Blue, and organic dyestuffs such as alizarin dyestuffs, azo dystuffs and metal phthalocyanine dyestuffs, and trace nutrients such as salts of iron, manganese, boron, copper, cobalt, molybdenum and zinc.<br>
In general, the formulations comprise between 0.1 and 95% by weight of active compound, preferably between 0.5 and 90%.<br>
In its commercially available formulations and in the use forms prepared from these formulations, the active compound according to the invention can be present as a mixture with other active compounds such as insecticides, attractants, sterilants, bactericides, acaricides, nematicides, fungicides, growth regulators or herbicides. The insecticides include, for example, phosphoric esters, carbamates, carboxylic esters, chlorinated hydrocarbons, phenylureas, substances produced by microorganisms, others.<br>

Wood and timber products which can be protected by the agent according to the invention, or mixtures comprising it, are to be understood as meaning, for example, construction timber, wooden beams, railway sleepers, bridge components, jetties,<br><br>
et^Co<br>
Le A 34 465-Foremi Countries<br><br>
vehicles made of wood, boxes, pallets, containers, telephone poles, wood lagging, windows and doors made of wood, plywood, chipboard, joinery, or timber products which quite generally are used in house construction or building joinery.<br>
The active compounds can be used as such, in the form of concentrates or generally customary formulations, such as powders, granules, solutions, suspensions, emulsions or pastes.<br>
The abovementioned formulations can be prepared in a manner known per se, for example by mixing the active compounds with at least one solvent or diluent, emulsifier, dispersant and/or binder and fixative, water repellent, if desired, desiccants and UV stabilizers and, if desired, colorants and pigments and other processing auxiliaries.<br>
The insecticidal compositions or concentrates used for the protecting wood and timber products contain the active compound according to the invention in a concentration of 0.0001 to 95% by weight, especially 0.001 to 60% by weight.<br>
The amount of the compositions or concentrates employed depends on the species and the abundance of the insects and on the medium.

In general, however, it will sufficient to employ 0.0001 to 20% by weight, preferably 0.001 to 10% by weight, of the active compound, based on the material to be protected.<br>
A suitable solvent and/or diluent is an organochemical solvent or solvent mixture and/or an oily or oil-type organic chemical solvent or solvent mixture of low volatility and/or a polar organochemical solvent or solvent mixture and/or water and, if appropriate, an emulsifier and/or wetter.<br>
Organochemical solvents which are preferably employed are oily or oil-type solvents with an evaporation number above 35 and a flashpoint of above 30°C, preferably<br><br><br>
Le A 34 465-Foreigi^€6uritries<br><br>
above 45°C. Such oily and oil-type solvents which are insoluble in water and of low volatility and which are used are suitable mineral oils or their aromatic fractions or mineral-oil-containing solvent mixtures, preferably white spirit, petroleum and/or alkylbenzene.<br>
Mineral oils which are advantageously used are those with a boiling range of 170 to 220°C, white spirit with a boiling range of 170 to 220°C, spindle oil with a boiling range of 250 to 350°C, petroleum and aromatics with a boiling range of 160 to 280°C, oil of turpentine, and the like.<br>

The organic oily or oil-type solvents of low volatility and with an evaporation number of above 35 and a flashpoint above 30°C, preferably above 45°C, can be replaced in part by organochemical solvents of high or medium volatility, with the proviso that the solvent mixture also has an evaporation number above 35 and a flashpoint of above 30°C, preferably above 45°C, and that the insecticide/fungicide mixture is soluble or emulsifiable in this solvent mixture.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, some of the organochemical solvent or solvent mixture is replaced by an aliphatic polar organochemical solvent or solvent mixture. Aliphatic organochemical solvents which contain hydroxyl and/or ester and/or ether groups are preferably used, such as, for example, glycol ethers, esters and the like.<br>
Organochemical binders for the purposes of the present invention are the synthetic resins and/or binding drying oils which are known per se and which can be diluted in water and/or dissolved or dispersed or emulsified in the organochemical solvents employed, in particular binders composed of or containing an acrylate resin, a vinyl<br><br>
Le A 34 465-For<br><br><br><br>
resin, for example polyvinyl acetate, polyester resin, polycondensation or polyaddition resin, polyurethane resin, alkyd resin or modified alkyd resin, phenol resin, hydrocarbon resin such as indene/coumarone resin, silicone resin, drying vegetable and/or drying oils and/or physically drying binders based on a natural and/or synthetic resin.<br>
The synthetic resin used as the binder can be employed in the form of an emulsion, dispersion or solution. Bitumen or bituminous substances may also be used as binders, in an amount of up to 10% by weight. In addition, colorants, pigments, water repellents, odour-masking agents, and inhibitors or anticorrosive agents and the like, all of which are known per se, can be employed.<br>
In accordance with the invention, the composition or the concentrate preferably comprises, as organochemical binders, at least one alkyd resin or modified alkyd resin and/or a drying vegetable oil. Alkyd resins which are preferably used in accordance with the invention are those with an oil content of over 45% by weight, preferably 50 to 68% by weight.<br>
Some or all of the abovementioned binder can be replaced by a fixative (mixture) or a plasticizer (mixture). These additives are intended to prevent volatilization of the active compounds, and also crystallization or precipitation. They preferably replace 0.01 to 30% of the binder (based on 100% of the binder employed).<br>
The plasticizers are from the chemical classes of phthalic acid esters, such as dibutyl phthalate, dioctyl phthalate or benzyl butyl phthalate, phosphoric esters, such as tributyl phosphate, adipic esters, such as di-(2-ethylhexyl) adipate, stearates such as butyl stearate or amyl stearate, oleates, such as butyl oleate, glycerol ethers or higher-molecular-weight glycol ethers, glycerol esters and p-toluenesulphonic esters.<br><br>
