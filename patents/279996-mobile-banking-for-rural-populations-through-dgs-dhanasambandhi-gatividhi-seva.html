				<td>Title: Mobile Banking for Rural populations throwgh DGS (Phanagambandhi Gatividhi Seva)<br>
Preamble<br>
Urban-oriented banks and finuicial institutions in India, perceive business prospects in shifting focus to the rural sector. The rural Indian maricet, a hitherto much neglected one, is now emerging as a large pool of high net worth individuals, trad«^ entr^»«neurs, processing industries, marketing and warehousing agencies, maiitet intermediaries, professionals, educirtional institutions, pliuitations and so on provides a wide range of business avenues and maiicet for tiiese institutions to diversify die risks and also seek growdi.<br>
Despite decades of effort and e^qierimentation in banking, the organised financial sector is still not able to meet the credit gi^ in the rural sector. It took time for banks to realise the po^entitA of the rural markets. Lack of infrastructure in the rural areas and the focus in the urban sector were the reasons. Directed and subsidised lending, cumbersome {nxxsedures, delay in sanctioning loans and lack of statutory backing fcH* recoveries were major impediments to the growth of banking in the rural sector. In view of this there is great need for technology to provide su|qx&gt;rt to the rural populace via an easy mode of access to btuik tKxounts aad credits besides, a need to offer the banking sector an easy reach with minimal infrastructure.<br>
One of the main problems in rural places (villages, small towns, eto.) is the lack of bank branches, ATM machines or oth«- type of financial organizaticms. In addition, credit cards are of limited use as there are no defnrtmental stores that accept credit cards or debit cards. Small rural stores do not have a point'Of-sale devices diat are typically used for swiping credit cards aiKl other type of cards to conduct purchases, eto.<br>
Accordingly, the prewnt invention addresses die need for nmd peq)le to conduct banking operations, access l»mking services, make payments to each other, send funds to each other, eto. despite die lack of traditicmal baiddng fiicilities such as ATM machines, banking counters and point-of-sale devices. The fnesent inventicm enables easy &amp; secure /payment, from even remote rural areas wh«e a mobile telephone network is in place, and without the need for any additioiuU infrastructure costs to the users and the banks. In most rural places in the world, very few ATMs or bank fiwiUties are in jwoximity to rural people. Veiy few rural people have bank aiccounts. In addition, very few point-of-sale (POS) devices are available or used in small stores and places of business. There is a need for simple-tooperate secure financial<br>
 <br>
transaction means. There is also a need to support farmer-to-farmer transactions in rural places where there are no ATM machines available and no banking counters, etc. There is also a need to maintain records of transactions made by rural people as they buy and sell produce.<br>
The present invention also address the need to identify an individual properly during mobile transactions in general. Mobile phones can be stolen and misused, user passv^ords can be stolen, PIN codes can be hacked (or guessed), etc. Thus, the identity of a user of a mobile phone needs to be properly ascertained and verified. The present invention address the '\iser identity" issue thereby making mobile transactions safer and more secure.<br>
INVENTOR: BINDU RAMA RAO<br>
ADDRESS OF THE INVENTOR: No. 21 Henley drive, Laguna Niguel, CA 92677, USA.<br>
Field &amp; Use of inventioii<br>
The said invention relates generally to banking in rural sectors in India and particularly to a solution wherein a person in a rural area is able to receive funds and send funds to otiiers. The present invention enables people living in rural communities to use their cell photos to provide an innovative funds transfer and payment service witiiout the need to provide credit/debit cards at purchase points. Currently, a rural person has little or no access to an ATM facility and faces a problem when he/she does not have hard cash at hand. The other issue is that vendors do not usually possess point of sale ^vices needed to record credit card or debit card transactions. In one embodiment, the inv^ition offers a simple, effective and secure solution that will help convert the individual's cell jAione effectively into a debit /credit card using or receiving device as the case may be. This would mean that vendors in rural areas wouki also be benefited with assured secure money transfer, die rural buyer would benefit from access to dieir bank acQounte or to credit. The invention also offers secure pathways making it a safe route fw operation. This is a much needed intervention in the Indian rural areas where banks operate m a veiy limited w»y and the capital outplay for building Imnking infiastructure is too hi^ to address the immediate need.<br>
 <br>
Prior Art<br>
There are a few examples of technology where the mobile telephone networic has been used for some types of mobile transactions. The Obopay system requires setting up accounts at Nokia stores and similar outlets initially by a user, and it involves associating a credit card with the user account for subsequent transactions. This makes it harder for rural people, especially those without a credit card, to participate. Once a credit card is associated, subsequent charges made for mobile purchases are conducted via the credit card. The Obopay system can be a burden on the rural user in India, as a network of Nokia stores or similar outlets may not be easily available. The Beam Card requires purchase of Beam Gift cards, that are used as pre-paid cards for purchases by users. Beam does not provide mobile banking support, nor adhoc p^ment from one user to another when the users have not setup some kind of account or registered with them -rather it provides gift card purchases and payment against such gift cards. The Done card system used by OSS is also based on gift ciuxis being purchased, often limited to small amounts (cannot be larger than a threshold such as Rs KHKK)) which limits what a person can do (cumot purchase two large bags of cement or two bags of fertilizers, OT even a plwe ticket to Delhi from Chennai). The whole gift-card based spprca^h is rather limiting, in that the person has to track down a place where such giftcards are sold, which are often not in the proximity / vicinity of a user. Thus these are unsuitable for rural places.<br>
In general, USB based memory devices are used by people to store their data or transfer data from PCs. The SanDisk miniSD card is slightly smaller than a full size SD card. Originally designed for the mobile phones, this card is used broadly in portable devices. Users plug Ais miniSD card into mobile (rfiones to store songs, download videos, etc.   Similar microSD cards are also available in the mu'ket. Very few if any memory stick manufacturers sell USB based memory sticks that can be tethered to a few mobile phones to stme Sfmgs that are downloaded by a user. Mini USB ports on mobile devices are used Ity tisers to connect to PCs and nuuu^e their contact lists, etc.<br>
RFIDs are available to tag retail and wholesale fHxxiucts for sale. In general, a merchant or salesperson with a specialized RFID reader scans such a product (with an RFID tag) and conducts a stocking operation or some such related warehousing and tracking operation. RPID tags are expected to revolutionize tracking of goods and retail sales of goods.<br>
 <br>
Problem to be solved<br>
Rural people do not cany credit cards / debit cards and point-of-sale devices are usually unavailable in stores found in rural areas, therefore credit card/debit cards(even if one possesses diem) are rendered useless. Access to ready cash is also limited as rural areas in India do not have reliable ATM machines. The other issue is that authentication of the user in an Indian rural setting via the traditional methods is a jn'oblem. Besides, there is a real problem of rural people being excluded ihim financial systems wid the modem innovations in tiie banking sector, due to their lack of knowledge and limited access to financial edtication. The present invention addresses all of these problems faced by rural India by providing a very simple, easy and very secure solution that would have a phenomenal reach witii negligible costs to the user.<br>
Object of the invention<br>
The principle object of the invention is to provide a means for secure funds transfra*, secure financial interactions, secure bill payment, and related cash transactions using a mobile telephone for people in rural India.<br>
Another object of the invention is to make this the said cash transaction secure tiirough multiple walls to raisure safety.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to minimize costs of infhistructure for such networks by the use of simple, small size USB ports that can be plugged into mobile device.<br>
One more object of the inventi<hi is to provide a platform for cash transaction similar credit card transactions without the use of point-of sale devices or tiie debit cards that arc swiped on reader nfc based></hi>
Statement of the invention<br>
Accordingly the invention provides a USB stick (herein called the U-Wallet), that acts in some ways like a credit/debit card when fitted into a mobile telephone, witiiout the need for card swiping devices and card readers, etc. The said arrangement constitutes an easy and simple mcHiey transaction network that is made secure throu^ a double autiiratication system consisting of a client and server mutual authenticaticm at the transp(»rt layer (elicit and serv^ certificates) and end-to-end data encryption. This security is enhanced by tiie use of a PIN code / password. Provisions exist for ^ditional security throi^ additional password protections. Thus the user is uniquely identified, his credentials are verified and secure mobile transactions are suppcHled, all<br>
 <br>
hout the use of credit cards, debit cards, card swiping machines, card readers, ATM machines, or point-of-sale devices.<br>
Brief summary of the invention<br>
The present invention is directed to apparatus and methods of operating a U-wallet as part of a secure mobile transaction system that would be used for tnmsacting money just as through a credit/debit card using tiie mobile telephone network in rural India. The clear technical advuitages of the said invention over the existing art has been delineated and the unique advantages of the invention to a rural user has been further described m the detailed description.<br>

Detailed dcscriptioa of the drawings<br>
The said invention provides a secure network tiiat provides adequate authentication - Surakshith Pramanikaran Network (SPN for short). The DGS service is provided on the SPN. Authentication of the rural users with client certificates provided. Also provide password based security for additional verificatiim. Client certificates are installed on mobile devices by users after registration to enable secure communications as well as subsequent authentication of device / user. Non-repudiation is possible by means of additional password {m)tection for transactions. These client certificates may be provided by a bank regulatory system such as NABARD or even the RBI to ensure transactions across banking institutions.<br>
Figure 1 is a perspective block diagram of a system lOS for conducting financial transactions using mobile phones, wherein secure funds transfer and financial transacticms can be conducted by, and between rural people, using their mobile phones 107,117. The participants on such secure funds transfer transactions employ their perscmal electronic wallets 109,119 to enable authentication of the participants. The secure server 111 makes it possible for users to<br>
 <br>
authenticate themselves (employing one or more security means) and conduct funds transfer, payments, balance inquiry and other financial transactions.<br>
All communications between the mobile phone 107 and the secure server 111 is over a secure communications layer (such as TLS or SSL), with mutual authentication, wherein the secure server 111 and the mobile device 107 each authenticate the other before conducting data transfer. Similarly, all communications between die mobile phone 117 and the secure server 111 is over a secure communications layer such as TLS or SSL, with mutual authentication. In addition, the secure server 111 exchanges the public key of the first user on tiie mobile phone 107 to the mobile phone 117, and the public key of the second user of the mobile phone 117 to the mobile phone 107, therein making it possible for both mobile phones 107,117 to encrypt data communicated to the other phone employing the public key received from the other phone. This provides end-to-end enciyption facilities. Alternatively, the public k^s received by a mobile phone 107 can be used to verify digital signatures of data communicated by the other mobile phone 117 (where tiie sending device digitally signs tiie data or message using a fnivate key associated with the sender ).<br>
When the user of the mobile phone 107 initiates a secure fimds transfer using the mobile phone 107, the user is prompted to plug in his/her personal electronic wallet 109 (into a micro-USB port of ttie mobile phcme 107, for example) and to then enter a PIN code (such as a 4 digit number or password). The user's PIN code is locally ccnnpu^ to a reference PIN code in one embodiment, and securely communicated to the secure server 1U for verification / authorization in a related embodiment. Then, the secure server 111 sends a message to ti» second party to a funds transfer or financial transaction, such as the user of tiie mobile phone 117. hi response, the mobile phone 117 prompts the user to plugin his / her personal electronic wallet 119 into the mobile phone 117, and then entst a PIN code / password in order to participate in the attempted funds transfer or financial transaction. Upon local (in the mobile phone 117) or remote (in the secure server 111) verification of the second party's PIN code / password, tiie details of the attempted funds transfer / transaction is displayed to the second party and the transaction is completed employing procedures and data transfer as necessary.<br>
The personal electronic wallets 109,119 are also referred to as uWallets, and diey are USB based devices in one embodiment, an NFC based device in another embodiment, and Bluetooth based devices in a third embodiment. Specifically, in cme embodhnrait, tiiey are USB based monory<br>
 <br>
sticks that provide a unique identification to the corresponding mobile phones 107,117, when they are communicatively coupled to them.<br>
The secure server 111 tracks the usage of the mobile phone 107 in fiinds transfer and other transactions and it associates a client certificate assigned to the user of the mobile phone 107 with the PIN code / password of the user, the unique identification retrieved or derived from the personal electronic wallet 109, and one or more accounts (bank iu:count, credit card account, savings account, gift card account, etc.) that are associated witii the user. In a related embodiment, an account is autCMnaticaily created for the user at a financial organization at the time of first usage of the personal electronic wallet 109.<br>
The system for conducting financial transactions supports access from laptops, computers and also mobile phones 107,117. In general, it comprises the secure server III ttiat interacts with a first secure mobile device 107 over a secure mutually autiienticated network 121. It also comprises the first personal electronic wallet 109 that is c^wble of interacting securely with the first secure mobile device 107. The first secure mobile device solicits a user personal identification code (also termed PIN code) from a user when the first personal electronic wallet 109 is communicatively coupled to Ae first secure mobile device 107. The first secure mobile device 107 securely interacts with the first personal electronic wallet 109 and conducts a funds related transaction when the first personal electronic wallet 109 is communicatively coupled to the first secure mobile device 107, and the user is authenticated at least by means of the PIN code.<br>
The first secure mobile device securely reports the funds related transaction to the secure server 11 ] over the secure mutually authenticated networic 121. The seccmd secure mobile device 117 interacts with the secure server 111 over the secure mutually auUienticated networic 123. The second personal electronic wallet 119 is capable of interacting securely with the second secure mobile device 117. The secure server 111 facilitates funds related transaction between Hie first secure mobile device 107 and the second secure mobile device 117 when the first personal electronic wallet 109 is communicatively coupled to the first secure mobile device 107 and the second personal electronic wallet 119 is communicatively coupled to die second secure mobile device 117.<br>
In one embodiment, the first personal electronic wallet 109 and the seccHid perscmal electronic wallet 119 are botii USB based memory sticks with a unique identification, that is pluggable and can be communicatively coupled to the first secure mobile device 107 and the second secure mobile device 117, respectively.<br>
 <br>

The first secure mobile device 107 comprises a first client security certificate that can be used for authentication by the secure server 111. The second secure mobile device 117 comprises a second client security certificate that can be used for authentication by the secure server 111. The secure server 111 communicates a second public key associated with the second client security certificate to the first secure mobile device 107 and a first public key associated with the first client security certificate to the second secure mobile device 117. The first secure mobile device 107 employing the second public key to encrypt the data communicated to the second secure mobile device 117. The second secure mobile device 117 employs the first public key to encrypt the data communicated to the first secure mobile device 107.<br>
The system 105 supports authenticating mutually for secure communications between a first mobile device 107 and fhe secure server 111 and between a second mobile device 117 and the secure server 111. The system 105 makes it possible to control access to financial transactions on the first mobile device 107 by using a first PIN code, and on the second mobile device 117 by use of a second PIN code. It also supports communicating a first unique identification by the first personal electronic wallet 109 that can be communicatively coupled to the first mobile device 107. In addition, it supports communicating a second unique identification by the second peraonal electrcmic wallet 119 tiiat can be communicatively coupled to the seccmd mobile device 117,<br>
It is now possible to identify, by the secure server 111, the first user using the first mobile devicel07 based on the first PIN code and the first unique identification. It is also possible to identify a second user currently using the second mobile device 117 based on the second PIN code and the second unique identification.<br>
The system 105 facilitates ( by the secure server 111), financial transactions between the first user and the second user, v^erein such final transactions are conducted after identifying the first user and the second user. Mutual authentication in the sy^m 105 occurs in a secure communications setup operation over a protocol, wherein the |n-otocoI is one of a TLS or SSL protocols. In addition, in one related embodiment, the first personal electronic wallet 109 and the second personal electronic wallet 119 are each one of a USB based memoiy stick with unique identification support or a bluetooth bt^ed memory stick with unique identification support (or, in one embodiment, even an RFID based client imit vdth unique identificatiiHi support)<br>
The method of claim 10 wherein facilitating titmsactions comprises prompting the first user on the first mobile device 107 to pick one of a set of supported financial transactions, and<br>
 <br>
receiving, from the first user, details of transactions. Such details comprise identification of one of a set of supported financial transactions, target user or mobile device identification (associating a second user associated with the second mobile device), transaction amounts, etc.<br>
It is important to facilitate determination of the second mobile device as the target device for the one of a set of supported financial transactions, and the system 105 does support that. It is able to prompt the second user on the second mobile device 117 to communicatively couple the second personal electronic wallet 119 to the second mobile device 117 and to enter a PIN code for authentication / authorization. It is capable of transferring details regwding the one of a set of supported financial transactions to the second mobile device 117 for display (and for collecting user approval, for example) to the second user. It is also capid^le of sending a user response regarding the one of a set of supported financial ti-ansactions from the second mobile device 117 to the first mobile device 107.<br>
The present invention also employs the retrieval of an IMEI of the first mobile device 107 and / or MSISDN currently associated with the mobile device 107, and associating them with the user's payment operations or money transactions conducted on the mobile device 107. It also addresses verifying the authorization of the associated user to conduct specific types of payment operations or transactions, based on the IMEI, MSISDN or related user data.<br>
In one embodiment, the system lOS supports RFID based identification of users (such as farmers or rural people) such as the first user using the first mobile devicel07. For example, the first user is provided with an RFID tag to uniquely identify the first user, and the first mobile device 107 is capable of reading the RFID tag provided to the first user (when in proximity). Then, the first user employs the RFID tag to conduct mobile banking, payments, and other transactions from the first mobile device 117. Thus, in this embodiment, some of the users use RFID based uWallets Aat comprise RFID tags (at least one RFID tag) i^ovided to them, (on a small card for example), while others, such as the second user using tiie second mobile device 117, employ a USB based uWallet.<br>
In a related embodiment, all mobile users of the system I OS, such as tiie first user using the first mobile device 107 and tiie second user using the second mobile device 117, employ RFID based secure uWallets, wherein each such secure uWallets comprise at least one unique RFID tag (that uniquely identifies the user in the system 105). The secure server 111 maintains a mapping of user client certificates and PINcodes to RFID tags assigned to the users.<br>

It also comprises an optional set of security credentials 211 that are used for secure communications with the mobile phone (that is currently associated with the personal electronic wallet 205) in one embodiment, and an optional set of client certificates and user account information in another related embodiment, wherein the client certificates are used for secure mutual authenticated communications with a secure server 111 and the user account is used to conduct debit and credit operations during user initiated funds transfer and payments activities.<br>
The communication circuitry 209 is a USB based communication circuitry in raie embodiment, wherein the personal electronic wallet 205 and the mobile phone interact securely, such as during communication of the unique identification to the mobile phone. In a related embodiment, it comprises a battery that makes it possible to also power the communic^ions between the personal electronic wallet 205 and die mobile phone.<br>
The communication circuiliy 209 is a bluetooth based communication circuity in one embodiment, wherein tlie mobile phone and the personal electronic wallet 205 are first paired before providing secure communications between the two.<br>
Thus, the present invention provided an USB based secure memory stick / dongle (herein called uWallet) that, in general, makes it possible to make payments, funds transfer etc. from the mobile phone of a user, tiiat also sometimes behaves as a credit card / bank card while connected to a mobile phone. A user can conduct monetary transacticms when the USB l»sed secure memory stick / dongle is plugged into the mobile device and the mobile device has connectivity (2G, 3G, etc.). A uniqiK user ID is {»ovided in each USB that uniquely identifies the user, the unique user ID is known to the SPN and is part of the authentication process.<br>
In general, the jn^esent invention makes it possible to securely authraiticate a nmd user (using the unique user ID from the uWallet, the client certificate in the mobile jAiom of the rural user and PIN code / password) and then permit mobile banking transactions over the mobile phone. Both<br>
 <br>
11<br>
participating individuals employ their individual mobile phones and secure USB / Bluetooth bases mobile banking devices (the uWallet).<br>
This makes it possible for a rural user to make balance inquity, receive funds remotely with no need for ATMs or bank teller counters and make payments to other farmers and merchants who have similar USB mobile banking devices (uWallets). It is also possible to integrate the said invention with external authentication systems.<br>
In one embodiment, the personal electronic wallet is an RFID based electronic device that is capable of interacting with a mobile phone and present its unique identification code, which the mobile device uses during financial transactions, or communicates to a secure server 111 as required.<br>
