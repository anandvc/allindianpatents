COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See section 10 and rule 13]<br>
Title: IMPROVED SYNTHESIS OF (2S-CIS)-2-(BROMOMETHYL&gt;2-(4-CHLOROPHENYL)-l,3 DIOXOLANE-4-METHANOL METHANESULFONATE (ESTER)<br>
Applicant: JANSSEN PHARMACEUTICA NV having its principal place of business at Turnhoutseweg 30,2340 Beerse, Belgium<br><br><br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is tobe performed:-<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
IMPROVED SYNTHESIS OF (2S-CIS)-2-(BROMOMETHYL&gt;-2-(4-CHLOROPHENYL)- 1 ,3-DIOXOLANE-4-METHANOL METHANESULFONATE(ESTER)<br>
5 The present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of (2S-cis)-2- (bromomethy l)-2-(4-chlorophenyl)-1,3-dioxolane-4-methanol methanesulftmate(ester), a key intermediate for the preparation of the apoB secretion/MTP inhibitor mitratapide.<br>
wherein the substituents on the 1,3-dioxolane ring have the (2S,4S) stereochemistry 30 according to the Cahn-lngold-Prelog nomenclature.<br>
Mitratapide is the INN (International Non Proprietary Name) for the compound (-)-[2S- 10 [2a,4a(S*)]]-4-[4-[4-[4-[[2-(4-chlorophenyl)-2-[[(4-methyI-4//-l ,2,4-triazol-3- yl)thio]methyi]-l ,3-dioxolan-4-yl]methoxyl-phenyl]-1 -piperazinyl]phenyl]-2,4- dihydro-2-( 1 -methylpropyl)-3//-1,2,4-triazoI-3-one having the following structure.<br><br><br>
Mitratapide has been described in WO-96/13499 as compound (40) having apolipoprotein B secretion and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein inhibiting properties therefore useful as a lipid lowering agent in the treatment of obesity.<br>
20 WO-00/37463 discloses S-oxide derivatives of mitratapide and a procedure to prepare (2S-cis)-2-(bromomethyl)-2-(4-chlorophenyl)-1,3-dioxolane-4-methanol methane- sulfonate(ester) as intermediate (18) in working example A.7 on page 20.<br>
(2S-cis)-2-(bromomethyl)-2-(4-chlorophenyl)-1,3-dioxolane-4-methanol methane- 25 sulfonate(ester) (hereinafter referred to as "compound A") has the following structure<br><br><br><br>
Since two of the three chiral carbon atoms of mitratapide are located on the 1,3-dioxolane ring an efficient synthesis of compound A is therefore highly desirable.<br>
The preparation of compound A has been described in WO-OO/37463 in Examples A.6 5 and A.7 as follows :<br><br><br>
Compound A was obtained with a yield of 23,7% according to the procedure of 10 Example A.7 in WO-OO/37463, i.e. reaction of (2S)-2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxoIane-4- methanol methane,sulfonate(ester) with 2-bromo-1 -(4-chloro-phenyl)-ethanone in dichloromethane as solvent.<br>
Unexpectedly, it has now been found that the yield of said reaction can be markedly 15        improved by performing the same reaction in the absence of a solvent while   bubbling nitrogen through the reaction mixture or applying underpressure to remove the acetone formed during the said reaction.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Chromatographic analysis by GC (HP5-column, length : 25.m, ID 320 ^m; film thickness 0.52 ^m; on column; initial temperature : 50°C; heating at 10°C/mm to 300°C) showed said (2S-cis)-2~(bromomethyl)-2-(4-chloropheny!)-1,3-dioxolane-4- methanol methane-sulfonate(ester) had a purity of more than 95% of the cis-<br>
5 stereoisomer and less than 5% of the trans-stereoisomer. <br>

20 Experimental part- Example 1<br>
A mixture of (2S)-2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxolane-4-methanol methanesulfonate(ester) (1 mol), 2-bromo-l-(4-chloro-phenyl)-ethanone (0.8 mol) was stirred in a flask. Methanesulfonic acid (0.24 mol) was added and the reaction mixture was stirred while 25 nitrogen was bubbled through the reaction mixture (alternatively the reaction mixture may also be stirred under vacuum). After six hours, stirring of the reaction mixture was stopped and the reaction mixture was left overnight. Ethyl acetate (1500 ml) was added and the mixture was stirred until it became homogeneous. The reaction mixture was then washed successively with water (200 ml), an aqueous Na2C03 solution (150 ml), 30 and water. (150 ml). The organic layer was evaporated till dryness and the residue was crystallised from ethanol (1 liter), yielding a solid residue. This residue was dissolved in diisopropylether (DIPE) and stirred for one week. Then methanol was added and after stirring for two hours, the precipitate was filtered off and dried, yielding 250.1 g (64.8%) of (2S-cis)-2<bromomethyl methane-sulfonate></bromomethyl><br><br>
