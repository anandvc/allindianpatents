				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an improved arrangement of power rails at transfer<br>
points of coke oven battery for smooth travel of quenching loco and car. More<br>
particularly, the present invention relates to an improved power rail formation at<br>
transfer points between fixed and moving zone of travel area of quenching loco and car<br>
of coke oven batteries. The power collection method of the above-mentioned mobile<br>
machine is through spring loaded power collectors from copper leaded power rails.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In an integrated steel plant, hot metal is produced from iron ore through blast furnaces.<br>
In this method of steel production coke plays an important role. It holds the whole<br>
burden and acts as the source of energy. This phenomenon can be easily understood<br>
by the fact that to produce 1 ton of hot metal about half a tone of coke is required.<br>
Coke production is carried out by carbonization of coking coal in ovens, which are<br>
arranged in series to form a coke oven battery. These batteries are of two types, one is<br>
top charge and another is stamp charge. In stamp charge batteries coal cake is<br>
prepared by stamping process and is charged into the oven in coal cake form. After<br>
about 20 hours of carbonization<br><br>
process coal gets converted into coke which is then pushed by stamping,<br>
charging and pushing machine (a mobile oven machine). This hot coke is<br>
received in Quenching car, which is coupled to a Quenching Loco. During<br>
this process loco drives the car at a fixed speed for uniform distribution of<br>
hot coke for proper distribution and in turn proper quenching and uniform<br>
moisture percentage of coke. This coke is then taken to quenching station<br>
where it is quenched by water flooding method. After quenching the coke<br>
is again brought to wharf and dumped for dispatching it to blast furnaces<br>
after proper sizing and screening.<br>
Quenching loco and car move on track rails just like conventional trains, but<br>
the power requirement is 415V and 3 phase so power transmission is<br>
realized 8 sets Power collectors (2 per phase and 2 as earth collectors)<br>
collecting power from copper headed power rails.<br>
There are 2 batteries of 70 ovens each, arranged one after the other.<br>
There are two quenching stations, one for each battery, located at the<br>
opposite ends of the battery. There are 3 sets of quenching loco and car.<br>
Schematic layout of tract rails, batteries and quenching station is shown in<br>
Fig. 1. At any moment of time two of them are in operations in each<br>
battery and one is kept down for maintenance and as standby. As the<br>
quenching stations are at the opposite ends and this is the requirement of<br>
the process, orientation of Quenching loco and car operating in one battery<br><br>
is required to be changed before putting it into operation in another<br>
battery. To facilitate this, there is a provision of transfer trolley at each end<br>
of both batteries. There are power rails on these transfer trolleys too for<br>
transmitting power to quenching loco and car. At these transfer points,<br>
which are 4 in numbers and at these points, rails are isolated by air gap of<br>
10 mm. schematic diagram of various transfer points is shown in fig.2 with<br>
dark boxes indicating transfer points between fixed and moving zone.<br>
Other transfer points are on fixed zone only and are provided for power<br>
isolation purpose and for ease of maintenance of power rails. As transfer<br>
trolley is movable, even perfect alignment of track rail doesn't ensure<br>
perfect alignment of power rails as these power rails are at a height of<br>
about 4 meters from floor. So the rails are ideally misalign by 5mm which<br>
went up with time and the misalignment further increases when loco and<br>
car are transferred to/from transfer trolley from/to fixed zone. The reason<br>
of the misalignment was analyzed and detect that the mass load in transfer<br>
trolley along with loco and car on it is considerably high which causes<br>
sagging of transfer trolley. A small deflection at the base of trolley<br>
reflected as large misalignment in power rails as the rails are at a height of<br>
4 meters from the base.<br>
Due to this misalignment power collectors of quenching loco use to break<br>
frequently resulting in damage to property and delay in production. The<br>
process of transferring loco from one point to another involved more<br><br>
manpower, was unsafe and use to take longer duration (about 1 hour) to<br>
complete the process as loco was required to be moved at a very slow<br>
speed.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore, an object of the present invention to propose an improved<br>
power rail formation at transfer points for power transmission applicable in<br>
quenching loco and car movement on transfer trolley, which eliminates the<br>
adversity of the prior act.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to propose an improved power<br>
rails formation at transfer points for power transmission applicable in<br>
quenching loco and car movement on transfer trolley, which reduces the<br>
change over time of 10-15 minutes from 1 hour.<br>
A still another object of the present invention is to propose an improved<br>
power rail formation at transfer points for power transmission applicable in<br>
quenching loco and car movement on transfer trolley, which increases the<br>
productivity.<br>
A further object of the present invention Is to propose an improved power<br>
rail formation at transfer points for power transmission applicable in<br>
quenching loco and car movement on transfer trolley, which is trouble free<br><br>
as well hassle free operation of orientation changing/transfer of loco<br>
to/from transfer trolley.<br>
A still further object of the present invention to propose an improved power<br>
rail formation at transfer points for power transmission applicable in<br>
quenching loco and car movement on transfer trolley, which reduces the<br>
involvement of man-power.<br>
An yet further object of the present invention to propose an improved<br>
power rail formation at transfer points for power transmission applicable in<br>
quenching loco and car movement on transfer trolley, which eliminates the<br>
hazards and improves safety.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
To eliminate the disadvantages of the prior art and for remedy of the<br>
existing problem in the production line an emphasis is made to Install a<br>
improve power rail at transfer points. The power rail was bent at 30<br>
degree at all the transfer points and was fixed In overlapping fashion with<br>
an air gap of 8mm to 12mm.<br>
Carbon blocks of the power collectors were given round shape at the edges<br>
to further improve the slide on the rail.<br><br>
After modifications, quenching ioco and car was moved, to and from<br>
transfer points, in both directions with different speeds and with different<br>
misalignments and found working without any problem. The new system<br>
was taking the misalignment of even 80mm without any jerks in the<br>
movement of power collector on the power rails.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
As shown in Fig.4, one both the ends of power rails (14) are bent at 30 degree (18) at<br>
all the transfer points and was fixed in overlapping fashion with an air gap 8-12 mm mounted<br>
on the side wall.<br>
The carbon blocks (19) of power collector is a round shape at the sharp edges to<br>
facilitate the sliding on the rails.<br>
The carbon brush (19) acts as a power collector and moves over the power rail (14)<br>
from which power is transmitted to quenching loco and car on transfer trolley (12,13) without<br>
interruption of power and dislocation of power collectors.<br>
This improved power rails formation at transfer points for power transmission applicable<br>
in quenching loco and car movement on transfer trolley reduces the change over time to 10-15<br>
minutes from 1 hour.<br>
The power collection method of quenching loco and car of coke oven batteries is through<br>
spring loaded power collectors from copper headed power rails.<br>
Disadvantages of previous arrangement:<br>
In previous arrangement, power rails on fixed part and movable transfer trolley were<br>
arranged in such a way that ends of the power rails use to align side by side with an air gap of<br>
10 mm. One set of power rails are on movable transfer trolley. Transfer trolley is on wheels and<br>
moves on track. Even on perfect alignment of transfer trolley track with fixed part's track (at<br>
ground level), there used to be a misalignment of at least 5 mm was observed at power rail's<br>
height (at height of 2 mtrs). When quenching loco and car comes on transfer trolley, due to<br>
weight, structure of transfer trolley sags (allowable sag of structure is 16 mm). Due to this sag<br>
at ground level, misalignment of power rail (at height of 2 mtrs) between fixed part and<br>
transfer trolley power rails, used to increase from 5 mm to 10-15 mm.<br>
As the rails ends were arranged side by side, due to above mentioned increased<br>
misalignment, spring loaded power collectors of quenching loco was not able to slide smoothly<br>
on rails resulting in breakage of collectors at that point. The after effects of this condition were,<br>
power interruptions, collector damage and delay in transfer of quenching loco.<br>
Inventive Steps:<br>
To overcome the problems faced at transfer points, following step was taken to minimize<br>
the problem:<br>
1. The breakthrough idea of overlapping bent power rails at transfer point is implemented.<br>
Two bent pieces of power rails are developed to fix the pieces as shown in sketch (Fig.4<br>
of submitted document), in ground power rail and tool trial in different conditions. The<br>
arrangement is working well even with misalignment of about 80 mm. After successful<br>
trial, the idea is implemented in one transfer point (for all 4 rails). The performance is<br>
observed and then replicated at all transfer points.<br>
After complete implementation of the inventive feature, the time for quenching loco to cross<br>
transfer point reduced from 1 hour to 10-15 minutes i.e. there is a saving of 45 mins per<br>
operation which is the main advantage in terms of reduction in production delay (On an<br>
average 4 such operations are required per month). Apart from this, equipment damage (power<br>
collector, cost of each collector is Rs. 45000.00) is totally eliminated, now there is no power<br>
interruption in quenching loco, no unsafe incident takes place and we don't need to lift<br>
collectors in presence of power (electrocution hazard eliminated).<br><br>
