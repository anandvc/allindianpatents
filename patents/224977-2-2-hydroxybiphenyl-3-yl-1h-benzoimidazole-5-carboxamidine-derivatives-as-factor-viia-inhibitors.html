DERIVATIVES AS FACTOR VIIA INHIBITORS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of invention<br>
The present invention relates to novel inhibitors of Factors VIIa, IXa, Xa, XIa, in<br>
particular Factor VIIa, pharmaceutical compositions comprising these inhibitors, and<br>
methods for using these inhibitors for treating or preventing thromboernbolic disorders.<br>
Processes for preparing these inhibitors are also disclosed.<br>
State of the Art<br>
Thrombosis results from a complex sequence of biochemical events, known as the<br>
coagulation cascade. A triggering event in coagulation is the binding of the serine protease<br>
Factor VUa (FVHa) found in the circulation, to tissue factor (TF), a receptor which is found<br>
on the surface of blood vessels after damage or inflammation. Once bound to TF, Factor Vila<br>
catalyzes the formation of the serine protease Factor Xa, which subsequently forms the final<br>
protease in the cascade, thrombin.<br>
The clinical manifestations of thrombosis range from acute myocardial infarction<br>
(AMI or heart attack) and unstable angina (UA) which occur in the key blood vessels of the<br>
hewl (coronary vasculature) to deep vein thrombosis (DVT) which is the formation of blood<br>
clots in lower extremities which often follows orthopedic surgery on the hip and knee, as well<br>
as general abdominal surgery and paralysis. Formation of DVT is a risk factor for the<br>
development of pulmonary embolism (PE) in which part of a blood clot fonned in the lower<br>
extremities, breaks off and travels to the lung where it blocks the flow of blood. The<br>
unpredictable development of PE often leads to a fatal outcome. Thrombosis can also be<br>
generalized systemicalry, with microclot formation occurring throughout the vascular system.<br>
This condition, known as disseminated mtravascular coagulation (DIC), can be a<br>
consequence of certain viral diseases such as Ebola, certain cancers, sepsis and rheumatoid<br>
arthritis. Severe DIC can lead to a dramatic reduction in the coagulation factors due to the<br>
excessive activation of the clotting response which may result in multiple organ failure,<br>
hemorrhage and death.<br>
The formation or embolization of blood clots m the blood vessels of the brain is the<br>
key event resulting in ischemic stroke. Triggering factors mat lead to stroke are atrial<br>
fibrillation or abnormal rhythm of the atria of the heart and atherosclerosis followed by<br>
thrombosis in the main arteiy leading from the heart to the brain (carotid artery). Over<br>
600,000 individuals suffer strokes each year in the "US. Two-thirds of these stroke victims<br>
suffer some disability, and one-third suffer permanent and severe disability. Accordingly,<br>
there is a need fot anthrombotic agents for the treatment of a variety of thrombotic<br>
conditions. The present invention fulfills this and related needs.<br>

derivative 6 by heating 5 with bispinacolato diboron in the presence of potassium acetate in<br>
the presence of Pd(dppf)Cl2.<br>

tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium and in a suitable organic solvent such as toluene or<br>
dimethoxyethane and a base such as aqueous sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate and the<br>
like. Compounds of formula 7 are either commercially available or they can be prepared by<br>
methods well known in the art. For example, 2-bromo-4-fluorophenol is commercially<br>
available. 1-(3-Bromo-4-methoxyemoxymethoxybenzyl)-3-tert-butyl urea can be prepared<br>
by treating 3-bromo-4-hydroxybenzonitrile with methoxyethoxymetbyl chloride in the<br>
presence of a base such as diisopropylamine, and the like, followed by reduction of the<br>
resulting 3-bromo-4-methylefhoxymethoxy)benzonitrile to 3-bromo-4-<br>
methoxyethoxymethoxybenzylamine with a suitable reducing agent such as diborane.<br>
Treatment of 3-bromo-4-memylethoxybenzylamine with tert-butylisocyanate men provides<br>
the desired compound. 1-(3-bromo-4-methoxyethoxymethoxybenzyl)-3-tert-butyl urea can<br>
be converted to 1-(3-bromo-4-methoxyemoxymethoxybenzyl)urea, if desired, by removal of<br>
the tert-butyl group under acidic hydrolysis reaction conditions.<br>

of Formula I where X1 is -N-. The reaction is carried out in the presence of a suitable oxidant<br>
such as benzoquinone, air oxidation, or FeCl3 and O2 and in a suitable organic solvent such as<br>
methanol, ethanol, and the like.<br>
Compounds of formula 9 are commercially available or they can be prepared by<br>
methods well known in the art For example, synthesis of 3, 4-diammobenzamidine<br>
monohydrochloride is known in the art<br>
Compounds of Formula I in which X1 is -CH-, R13 is hydrogen, and X2, X3, X4, R1,<br>
R2, Rx, Ry, and Rz are as defined in the Summary of the Invention can be prepared as<br>
described in Scheme II below.<br>
Protection of the hydroxy group in a compound of formula 8 with a suitable hydroxy<br>
protecting group provides a compound of formula 10. A comprehensive list of suitable<br>
hydroxy protective groups can be found in T.W. Greene, Protective Groups in Organic<br>
Synthesis, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. 1981, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by<br>
reference in its entirety. Preferred hydroxy protecting group is 2-methoxyethoxymethyl. The<br>
reaction is typically carried out in the presence of a base such as diispropylethylamine, and<br>
the like and in a halogenated organic solvent such as dichloromethane, carbon tetrachloride,<br>
chloroform, and the like.<br>
Ethynylation of 10 utilizing a modified procedure described in Muller, S.; Liepold,<br>
B.; Roth G. J.; Bestmann H. J. Synlett 1996,6, S21-S22 provides a ethynylbiphenyl<br>
compound of formula 11.<br>
Reaction of a compound of formula 11 with a cyano compound of formula 12 where<br>
PG1 is a suitable nitrogen protecting group such as methylsulfonyl, tert-butoxycarbonyl,<br>
trifluoroacetyl, and the like, and X is halo, utilizing the reaction conditions described in<br>
Sakamoto, T; Kondo, Y.; Iwashita, S.; Nagano, T.; Yamanaka, H. Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1988,<br>
36, 1305 provides 5-cyano-2-biphenyl-3-ylindole compound of formula 13 (where X1, X2, X3<br>
and X4 are carbon and PG1 is not hydrogen). Deprotection of the amino group in 13 provides<br>
a 5-cyano-2-biphenyl-3-yl-lH-indole compound of formula 14. The reaction conditions<br>
utilized in the deprotection step depends on the nature of the nitrogen protecting group. For<br>
example, if the protecting group is methylsulfonyl it is removed under basic hydrolysis<br>
reaction conditions. Suitable bases are aqueous sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, and<br>
the like. The reaction is carried out in an alcoholic solution such as methanol, ethanol, and<br>
the like. If the protecting group is ferf-butoxycarbonyl it is removed under acidic hydrolysis<br>
reaction conditions. Compounds of formula 12 are either commercially available or they can<br>
be prepared by methods well known in the art<br>
The hydroxy-protecting group in 14 is then removed to provide 5-cyano-2-(2-<br>
hydroxybiphenyl-3-yl)-1H-indole 15. The reaction conditions employed for the deprotection<br>
reaction depend on the nature of the hydroxy protecting group. For example, if the protecting<br>
group is 2-methoxyethoxymethyl, it is removed by treating 15 with an acid under non-<br>
aqueous reaction conditions, in a suitable alcoholic solvent<br>
The cyano group in compound 15 is then converted into the carbamimidoyl group by<br>
first treating 15 with hydrogen chloride gas in an anhydrous alcoholic solvent such as<br>
methanol, ethanol and the like, and then treating the resulting (5-methoxycarbonimidoryl)-2-<br>
(2-hydroxybiphenyl-3-yl)-1H-indole 16 with an inorganic base such as ammonium carbonate,<br>
and the like in an alcoholic solvent such as methanol, ethanol, or with excess ammonia to<br>
give resulting (5-carbamimidolyl)-2-(2-hydroxybiphenyl-3-yl)-1H-mdole of Formula I.<br>
Alternatively, compound 15 can be converted to a compound of Formula I by first refluxing it<br>
with hydroxylamine in an alcoholic solvent such as ethanol and then treating the resulting (N-<br>
hydroxycarbamimidoyl)-2-(2-hydroxybiphenyl-3-yl)-1H-indole with acetic anhydride in<br>
acetic acid to give (N-acetoxycarbamimidoyl)-2-2-hydroxybiphenyl-3-yl)-1H-indole. The<br>
acetoxy group is then removed under hydrogenation reaction conditions by treating (N-<br>
acetoxycarbamimidoyl)-2-(2-hydroxybiphenyl-3-yl)-1H-indole with 10% palladium in an<br>
alcoholic solvent such as methanol, ethanol, and the like.<br>
Compounds of Formula I in which X1 is -N-, R13 is hydrogen, R3 is -CONR7R8 or<br>
-(alkylene)-CONR9R10 where R7,R8, R9 and R10 are as described in the Summary of the<br>
Invention and X2, X3, X4, R1, R2, R\ Ry, Rz and Ru are as defined in the Summary of the<br>
Invention can be prepared as described in Scheme III below.<br>
Scheme III<br>
Compounds of Formula I in which X1 is -N-, R13 is hydrogen, R3 is -GONR7R8 or -<br>
(alkylene)-CONR9R10 where R7, R8, R9 and R10 are as described in the Summary of the<br>
Invention and X2, X3, X4, R1, R2, Rx, Ry, Rz and R11 are as defined in the Summary of the<br>
Invention can be prepared by first converting a compound of formula 18 (where R is hydroxy<br>
protecting group and R3 is a -COOR' or -alkylene-COOR' group where R' is alkyl) to a<br>
compound of formula 19 (where R3 is an -COOR' or -alkylene-COOR' group where R' is<br>
alkyl) as described in Scheme I. Compounds of formula 18 are either commercially available<br>
or they can be prepared by methods well known in the art. Some such methods are described<br>
in Applicant's PCT Application Publication No. WO 00/35886 the disclosure of which, is<br>
incorporated herein by reference in its entirety<br>
Hydrolysis of the ester group provides a corresponding compound of formula 20<br>
(where R3 is an -COOH or -alkylene-COOH). Amination of 20 with an amine of formula<br>
NHR7R8 or NHR9R men provides a compound of Formula I. The amination reaction is<br>
carried out reacting 20 with the amine in the presence of a suitable coupling agent<br>
e.g., benzotriazole-1-yloxytris-pyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate (PyBOP®),<br>
O-benzotriazol-1-yl-N,N,N,N'-tetramethyl-uronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU),<br>
O-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)- 1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HATU),<br>
1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodimide hydrochloride (EDC), or<br>
1,3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), optionally in the presence of 1-hydroxybenzotriazole<br>
(HOBT), and a base such as N,N-diisopropylethylamine, triethylamine, N-<br>
mefhyhnorpholine, and the like. The reaction is typically carried out at 20 to 30 °C,<br>
preferably at about 25 °C, and requires 2 to 24 h to complete. Suitable reaction solvents are<br>
inert organic solvents such as dimethylformamide, and the like.<br>
Compounds of Formula I can be converted to other compounds of Formula I. For<br>
example, a compound of Formula I where Rx is alkoxy, can be converted to corresponding<br>
compound of Formula I where Rx is hydxoxy by hydrolysis of the alkoxy group by a suitable<br>
dealkylating reagent such as hydrobromic acid, and the like. A compound of Formula I<br>
where Rz is cyano can be converted to a corresponding compound of Formula I where Rc is<br>
aminocarbonyl under hydrolysis reaction conditions. The cyano group can also be reduced to<br>
give aminomethyl group which can be treated with isocyanate or thiocyanate to give<br>
corresponding compound of Formula I where Rz is ureidomethyl or thioureidomethyl<br>
respectively. A compound of Formula I where R13 is hydrogen can be converted to a<br>
corresponding compound of Formula I where R13 is hydroxy or alkoxy by reacting it with<br>
hydroxylamine or alkoxyamine under conditions well known in the art.<br>

convenient daily dosage regimen, which can be adjusted according to the degree of affliction.<br>
Oral compositions can take the form of tablets, pills, capsules, semisolids, powders, sustained<br>
release formulations, solutions, suspensions, elixirs, aerosols, or any other appropriate<br>
compositions.<br>
The choice of formulation depends on various factors such as the mode of drug<br>
administration (e.g., for oral administration, formulations in the form of tablets, pills or<br>
capsules are preferred) and the bioavailability of the drug substance. Recently',<br>
pharmaceutical formulations have been developed especially for drugs mat show poor<br>
bioavailability based upon the principle that bioavailability can be increased by increasing the<br>
surface area i.e., decreasing particle size. For example, U.S. Pat No. 4,107,288 describes a<br>
pharmaceutical formulation having particles in the size range from 10 to 1,000 nm in which<br>
the active material is supported on a crosslinked matrix of macromolecules. U.S. Pat No.<br>
5,145,684 describes the production of a pharmaceutical formulation in which the drug<br>
substance is pulverized to nanoparticles (average particle size of 400 nm) in the presence of a<br>
surface modifier and men dispersed in a liquid medium to give a pharmaceutical formulation<br>
mat exhibits remarkably high bioavailability.<br>
The compositions are comprised of in general, a compound of Formula I in<br>
combination with at least one pharmaceuticalry acceptable excipient. Acceptable excipients<br>
are non-toxic, aid administration, and do not adversely affect the therapeutic benefit of the<br>
compound of Formula I. Such excipient may be any solid, liquid, semi-solid or, in the case of<br>
an aerosol composition, gaseous excipient that is generally available to one skilled in the art<br>
Solid pharmaceutical excipients include starch, cellulose, talc, glucose, lactose,<br>
sucrose, gelatin, malt, rice, flour, chalk, silica gel, magnesium stearate, sodium stearate,<br>
glycerol monostearate, sodium chloride, dried skim milk and the like. Liquid and semisolid<br>
excipients may be selected from glycerol, propylene glycol, water, emanol and various oils,<br>
including those of petroleum, animal, vegetable or synthetic origin, e.g., peanut oil, soybean<br>
oil, mineral oil, sesame oil, etc. Preferred liquid carriers, particularly for injectable solutions,<br>
include water, saline, aqueous dextrose, and glycols.<br>
Compressed gases may be used to disperse a compound of mis invention in aerosol<br>
form. Inert gases suitable for this purpose are nitrogen, carbon dioxide, etc.<br>
Other suitable pharmaceutical excipients and their formulations are described in<br>
Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, edited by E. W. Martin (Mack Publishing Company,<br>
18th ed., 1990).<br>
The amount of the compound in a formulation can vary within the full range<br>
employed by those skilled in the art Typically, the formulation will contain, on a weight<br>
percent (wt %) basis, from about 0.01-99.99 wt % of a compound of Formula I based on the<br>
total formulation, with the balance being one or more suitable pharmaceutical excipients.<br>
Preferably, the compound is present at a level of about 1-80 wt %. Representative<br>
pharmaceutical formulations containing a compound of Formula I are described below.<br>
The compounds of Formula I can be administered alone or in combination with other<br>
compounds of Formula I or in combination with one or more other active ingredients). For<br>
example, a compound of Formula I can be administered in combination with another<br>
anticoagulant agent(s) independently selected from a group consisting of a thrombin<br>
inhibitor, a factor DCa, and a factor Xa inhibitor. Preferably, the thrombin inhibitor is<br>
Inogatran®, Melagatran® or prodrugs thereof which are disclosed in PCT Application<br>
Publication Nos. WO 94/29336 and WO 97/23499, the disclosures of which are incorporated<br>
herein by reference in their entirety. Factor Xa inhibitors that may be used in the<br>
combination products according to the invention include those described in Current Opinion<br>

thereof.<br>
Synthetic Examples<br>
Reference 1<br>
Synthesis of 2-methoxymethylether-S-fluoro-phenylboronic acid<br>
2-Bromo-4-fluorophenol (2S.0 g, 0.13 mol) was dissolved in dry dichloromethane<br>
(100 mL) and dimethoxymethane (US mL, 1.30 mol). Phosphorus pentoxide (110.8 g,<br>
0.39 mol) was added portion-wise to the solution such that the reaction temperature remained<br>
below 40 °C. The mixture was stirred vigorously at room temperature for 2 hours and then<br>
carefully poured into IN aqueous NaOH (50 mL). The organic layer was separated, washed<br>
with water and men brine, dried over anhydrous MgSO4, filtered and concentrated to give<br>
2-bromo-4-fluoro-1-methoxymethoxy-benzene (30.1 g) as a colorless oil.<br>
A 500 mL round bottom flask was charged with a 1.6 M solution of n-butyllithium in<br>
hexanes (100 mL, 0.16 mol) and flushed with nitrogen. The solution was cooled to -78 °C<br>
and a solution of 2-bromo-4-fluoro-1-methoxymeuioxy-benzene (30.1 g, 0.13 mol) in dry<br>
tetrahydrofuran (50 mL) was added dropwise over one hour. The mixture was stirred at<br>
-78 °C and then trimethylborate (20 mL, 0.175 mol) was added very slowly via syringe. The<br>
reaction was allowed to gradually warm to room temperature and after two hours the mixture<br>
was poured into ice. The mixture was acidified to pH 4 with 5% aqueous citric acid and<br>
extracted with ethyl acetate (x3). The combined organic extracts were washed with water<br>
and brine, dried over MgSCU and filtered. The solvent was evaporation under reduced<br>
pressure and the residue was recrystallized from hexanes give 2-methoxymethoxy-<br>
5-fluorophenyIboronic acid (18.9 g).<br>
Reference 2<br>
Synthesis of tert-butyl 2-bromo-5-chloro-6-cyano-pyridin-3-yl-carbamate<br>
2-Hydroxy-5-nitropyridine (50 g, 357 mmol) and N-chlorosuccinimide (SS g,<br>
410 mmol) were suspended in anhydrous DMF (150 mL). The suspension was stirred at<br>
room temperature for 18 hours. The resulting homogeneous reaction mixture was diluted by<br>
the slow addition of water (750 mL), which resulted in a pale yellow precipitate. The solids<br>
were isolated via filtration and dried under high vacuum to provide 3-chloro-5-nitro-<br>
2-hydroxypyridine (59 g, 95% yield).<br>
3-Chloro-5-nitro-2-hydroxy-pyridine (20 g) was added in small portions to<br>
thionylchloride (200 mL) under vigorous stirring. The suspension was heated to 100 °C<br>
within 1 hour, stirred at 100 °C for 1 hour and men cooled to room temperature. The solvent<br>
was removed under reduced pressure and the residue was dissolved in ethyl acetate. The<br>
solution was washed with water (3 x 200 mL) and the organic layer was dried over MgSO4.<br>
The solvent was removed under reduced pressure to give 2,3-dichloro-5-nitropyridine (18 g)<br>
was obtained as a pale yellow solid.<br>
A solution of 2,3-dichloro-5-nitropyridine (9.75 g) and potassium iodide (29 g) in<br>
acetic acid (120 mL, degassed with nitrogen) was heated to 100 °C for 1.5 hours under<br>
nitrogen. The brown solution was cooled to room temperature and men ethyl acetate<br>
(300 mL) added. The organic phase was separated and washed with water (2 x 100 mL)<br>
and dilute aqueous sodium sulfite (100 mL). Evaporation of the solvent gave crystalline<br>
3-chloro-2-iodo-5-nitro-pyridine (13.11 g).<br>
A suspension of copper cyanide (7 g) and 3-chloro-2-iodo-5-nitro-pyridine (7 g) in<br>
acetonitrile (200 mL) was heated to 80 °C within 1 hour and stirred at 80 °C for 5 hours. The<br>
solvent was evaporated and the residue was filtered in ethyl acetate over silicon dioxide gave<br>
3-chloro-2-cyano-5-nitro-pyridine (4.26 g).<br>
A solution of tin chloride (52 g) and 3-chloro-2-cyano-5-nitro-pyridine (10.3 g) was<br>
stirred in ethyl acetate (200 mL) at room temperature for 10 minutes and at 70 °C for 4 hours.<br>
The solution was cooled to room temperature and diluted with ethyl acetate (500 mL).<br>
Sodium bicarbonate (100 g) added in four portions to the mixture within 4 hours. The<br>
mixture was stirred vigorously for 20 hours. The suspension was filtered and the filtrate was<br>
washed with saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution. The solvent was evaporated to<br>
give 5-amino-3-chloro-2-cyanopyridine (4.34 g) as an off-white powder.<br>
Step(f)<br>
Bromine (7.22 g) was added to a stirring mixture of S-amino-3-chloro-<br>
2-cyanopyridine (4.61 g) and sodium acetate (4.81 g) in anhydrous acetic acid (ISO mL) at<br>
room temperature. The mixture was stirred at 60°C for 2 hours. The solvents and excess<br>
bromine were evaporated and the residue was recrystalliezed from ethyl acetate to give<br>
5-amino-6-bromo-3-chloro-2-cyano-pyridine (6.23 g).<br>
5-Amino-6-bromo-3-chloro-2-cyano-pyridine (1.6 g) was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran<br>
(S mL) at room temperature. iV^V-dimethylaminopyridine (0.5 g) followed by di-tert-butyl<br>
dicarbonate (3.78 g) in small portions were added to the solution and the mixture was stirred<br>
at room temperature for 30 minutes. The solvent was removed by evaporation and the<br>
residue was dissolved in dicloromethane (60 mL). Trifluoroacetic acid (1 g) was added to the<br>
solution and the mixture was stirred for 1 hour. The solvent was removed by evaporation and<br>
product was purified from the residue by column chromatography (EtOAc/hexanes 1/1) to<br>
give tert-butyl 2-brorno-5-chloro-6-cyario-pvridin-3-yl-carbamate (1 g). MS (obs.):<br>

EXAMFLE3<br>
Phannacokinetic Assay<br>
Rats with pie-implanted jugular vein catheters, which were filled with<br>
heparin/saline/PVP lock prior to shipment, were bought from Charles River. Three rats were<br>
selected for each study, weighed, and injected wife test compound by tail vein injection. Any<br>
residual test compound was retained and stored at -70 °C for later analysis.<br>
Blood samples (0.2S mL each) were collected from the indwelling catheters at<br>
specified times over 120 h. The cameters were flushed with physiological saline immediately<br>
after each collection and filled with heparinized saline after each 8,24 and 48 h collection. In<br>
die event (hat a catheter failed, blood samples were collected via the retro-orbital sinus under<br>
isoflurane anesthesia at the appropriate time.<br>
Blood samples were placed in 0.5 mL Microtainer® tubes (lithium heparin), shaken<br>
gently and stored on wet ice. The samples were centrifuged for 10 minutes at 2400 rpm in a<br>
refrigerated centrifuged. Plasma samples (0.1 mL) from each tube were transferred to 0.5 mL<br>

EXAMPLE 4<br>
In vitro Clotting Assays.....aPTT and PT<br>
Coagulation assays, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and prothrombin<br>
time (PT) were carried out based on the procedure described in Hougie, C. Hematology<br>
(Williams, W. J., Beutler, B., Erslev, A. J., and Lichtman, M. A., Eds.), pp. 1766-1770<br>
(1990), McGraw-HiU, New York.<br>
Briefly, the assays were performed using normal human titrated plasma and were<br>
performed at 37 oC on a coagulometer (Elcctra 800) in accordance with the manufacturer's<br>
instructions (Medical Laboratory Automation- Pleasantville, New York). The instrument was<br>
calibrated with plasma immediately prior to collecting clotting limes for samples with<br>
inhibitors. The aPTT and FT doubling concentrations were calculated by fitting inhibitor<br>
dose response curves to a modified version of the Hill equation.<br>
