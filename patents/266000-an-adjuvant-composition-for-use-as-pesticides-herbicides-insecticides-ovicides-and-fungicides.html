				<td>Technical Field<br>
An adjuvant for use with systemic herbicides, pesticides, insecticides,<br>
ovicides and fungicide on animals, birds, plants, trees, fruits and vegetables.<br>
Background Art<br>
Various insects such as lice, ticks, mites and aphides attack untreated and<br>
unprotected trees and plants. Moreover, fungi left uncontrolled can damage and<br>
even destroy plants and trees including crops associated therewith.<br>
in the past, various oils have been used to control insects and mites.<br>
Recently, however, renewed attention has focused on the use of oils as a natural<br>
substitute for traditional insecticides with attendant toxic and other dangerous side<br>
effects.<br>
These oils include horticultural oils that are highly refined petroleum<br>
products than can be mixed with water for application for control of target insect<br>
and mite pests without deleterious effects. Modern horticultural oils do not include<br>
vegetable, fish or whale oils.<br>
Horticultural spray oils are the low toxicity alternative to broad-spectrum<br>
insecticides. Since the mechanism of insect and mite control with spray oils is by<br>
suffocation and/or repellency of egg laying females, there is no requirement for the<br>
addition of toxic chemicals. These properties are a valuable and well-recognized<br>
component of the practice of integrated pest management where oil spraying is<br>
intrinsically linked to natural control of pests by predators and parasitoids.<br>
Horticultural spray oils are formulated on highly refined clear oil with a minimum of<br>
nonionic surfactant. Independent environmental impact studies have shown that<br>
D-C-TRON has no detrimental effect on the environment. Mammalian toxicity<br>
studies published in the American Journal of Industrial Medicine have shown that<br>
oils at this refinement level are non-toxic and non-carcinogenic.<br>
2<br><br><br>
Generally, oil sprays are safe to humans. These oil sprays have little, if any,<br>
negative effect on wildlife and non-target insects in the environment. Furthermore,<br>
oil sprays are less toxic due to the method by which they kill target pests. In<br>
particular, the thin film of oil covers the target insect or mite and plugs the<br>
spiracles or pores through which the pests or parasites breathe. The cause of<br>
death is primarily suffocation. Large, motile insects and animals that breathe by<br>
another method are not affected by these oils.<br>
Another advantage of oil applications is the absence of objectionable odors.<br>
In addition, oils are relatively inexpensive and significantly less expensive than<br>
many insecticides.<br>
Unfortunately, there are limitations to the use of oil treatments. For<br>
example, oils are only effective against those pests that are thoroughly coated by<br>
the spray solution. This usually means that only small, immobile or slow moving<br>
pests that are exposed on the surface of the plant or tree at the time of application<br>
will be controlled.<br>
Since oil sprays only work by contracting and covering the target pest,<br>
thorough application is essential. Missed surface areas provide a safe refuge for<br>
the target pests.<br>
U.S. 6,258,369 and U.S. 6,277,389 disclose a non-toxic aqueous pesticide<br>
for application on plants and animals comprising at least one surfactant and at<br>
least one high terpene containing natural oil. The pesticide is used to effectively<br>
control insects and parasites such as darkling beetles, lice, ticks, mites, flies,<br>
aphides, mosquitoes and chiggers found on plants and animals.<br>
U.S. 5,693,344 shows a hazard-free method for controlling insects using a<br>
non-* toxic composition in the form of a fragrance and crystalline particles which<br>
puncture directly through the exoskeleton of an insect. In operation, the particles<br>
work themselves between the insect's protective body plates and then puncture<br>
the exoskeleton permitting entry of the fragrance into the body of the insect. Once<br>
3<br><br><br>
inside, the particles absorb up to four times their weight of the vital body fluids of<br>
the insect and the fragrance has a neural effect on the insect.<br>
U.S. 5,143,939 shows a method of treating soil and agricultural crops for<br>
controlling worms and nematodes comprising a nonionic surfactant, namely an<br>
alkylox- ypolyethyleneoxyethanoi used as the sole active ingredient to control<br>
fungus, mites, worms, termites, nematodes and other insects.<br>
U.S. 4,379,168 relates to pesticides containing d-limonene as an insect-<br>
killing ingredient with surfactants or emulsifiers and water. The pesticide<br>
compositions are liquids designed for use as a dip to rid small animals of fleas and<br>
ticks, a spray to kill fleas and ticks on small animals and in the kennels of small<br>
animals; a spray to kill fies on small animals and in the kennels of small animals;<br>
and a spray or liquid to rid household areas of cockroaches and other insect pests.<br>
U.S. 6,248,710 B1 discloses a water-soluble or water-dispersible material<br>
for deposition onto a fabric substrate during a treatment process comprising<br>
polysaccharide structure having at least one substituent benefit agent group and<br>
optionally, one or more other substituent groups. The polysaccharide structure has<br>
one or more regions with at least 3, preferably at least 4 consecutive unsubstituted<br>
saccharide rings.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an adjuvant formulated for use on animals,<br>
birds, plants, trees, fruits and vegetables as an adjuvant in combination with<br>
systemic herbicides, pesticides, insecticides, ovicides and fungicide. The<br>
composition comprises at least one surfactant and at least one high terpene. The<br>
invention also includes the method of application of the composition.<br>
High terpene containing natural oil as used herein means those natural oils<br>
having a terpene content of at least 50 per cent. It is preferable that the high<br>
terpene natural oil contains at least 65 per cent. Suitable high terpene containing<br>
4<br><br><br>
natural oils includes oil from conifers such as citrus peel oils, preferably orange oil,<br>
grapefruit oil, lemon oil or pine oil. Of these, orange oil is preferred and cold<br>
pressed orange oil the most preferred. The preferred terpene content is from about<br>
80 per cent to about 90 per cent and most preferred from about 85 per cent to<br>
about 87 per cent, all by weight.<br>
The amount of high terpene containing natural oils in the composition<br>
depends upon the amount of terpenes in the specific oil used. Generally, the<br>
composition contains from about 2 per cent by weight to about 8 per cent by<br>
weight of high terpene containing natural oil, preferably about 5 per cent by weight.<br>
Anionic and nonionic surfactants are acceptable for use in the composition<br>
of the present invention. Anionic surfactants such as salts of fatty acids, alky!<br>
sulphates, alkyl ether sulphonates and alkyl aryl suiphonates are preferred.<br>
The composition may also contain preservatives, pH neutralizes and/or<br>
clarifiers or stabilizers. The balance of the composition is water.<br>
In use, the adjuvant, when combined with systemic herbicides, pesticides,<br>
insecticides, ovicides and fungicides, is diluted and sprayed or misted on animals,<br>
birds, plants, trees, fruits or vegetables.<br>
When so applied, the composition is effective as an adjuvant in enhancing<br>
the effect of systemic herbicides, insecticides, ovicides and fungicides that are<br>
applied to control various diseases, pests and insects including darkling beetles,<br>
lice, ticks, mites, flies, aphides, thrips, mealybugs, mosquitoes and chiggers.<br>
The composition is also effective as an adjuvant in enhancing fungicides in<br>
controlling fungi. While not to be bound by theory, absorption of fungicide, once<br>
blended with the adjuvant, is increased both in speed as well as percentage<br>
absorbed.<br>
5<br><br><br>
Finally, the composition as an adjuvant enhances water penetration and<br>
absorption by the soil as well as decreases water logging. These better soil<br>
conditions lead to improved root and plant growth.<br>
The invention accordingly comprises the features of construction,<br>
combination of elements, and arrangement of parts that will be exemplified in the<br>
construction hereinafter set forth, and the scope of the invention will be indicated<br>
in the claims.<br>
