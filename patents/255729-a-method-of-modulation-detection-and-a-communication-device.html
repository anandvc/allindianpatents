BACKGROUND<br>
1.	Field<br>
This invention relates generally to communication systems, and more particularly<br>
to reducing the likelihood that the modulation method used to transmit a signal is<br>
misidentified by the receiver due to the presence of interference.<br>
2.	Description of Related Art<br>
Presently, wireless communication systems, such as the Global System for Mobile<br>
Communications (GSM), have been designed to meet the increasing need for ubiquitous<br>
personal communications capable of supporting both voice and data services. Cellular<br>
systems such as GSM are designed to exploit the concept of frequency re-use; that is,<br>
where a specific radio frequency (RF) carrier is used in multiple cells within a given<br>
geographic region. Base stations (BS) and mobile stations (MS) within this geographic<br>
region are required to accept co-channel and adjacent channel interference from other<br>
base stations or mobile stations in the area. The level of interference is controlled by an<br>
appropriately constructed frequency re-use pattern or by the use of frequency-hopping<br>
methods for interference averaging.<br>
Naturally, receivers operating in such environments are primarily concerned with<br>
the accurate demodulation of voice or data channel transmissions. Nevertheless, base<br>
stations and mobile stations designed to receive transmissions associated with the<br>
Enhanced Data for GSM Evolution (EDGE) enhanced General Packet Radio Service<br>
(GPRS) packet data transmission mode of GSM (sometimes referred to as "EGPRS")<br>
must, however, receive transmissions using both Gaussian Minimum Shift Keying<br>
(GMSK) and 8-ary Phase Shift Keying (8-PSK) modulation. Since the modulation type<br>
associated with any particular EGPRS transmission is not explicitly signaled by the<br>
transmitter, the receiver must autonomously determine the modulation type used for the<br>
transmission as well as performing demodulation of the data signal. This function,<br>
usually referred to as format detection or more frequently referred to as modulation<br><br>
detection, must have performance consistent with the associated demodulation<br>
performance. That is, the probability of the receiver misdetecting the modulation type,<br>
e.g. identifying an EGPRS GMSK transmission as an 8-PSK transmission, should ideally<br>
be sufficiently low that the overall probability of receiving a transmitted data symbol in<br>
error is not significantly increased over the case where the modulation type is known to<br>
the receiver without error.<br>
Recently, the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standards working group<br>
responsible for the GSM and EDGE Radio Access Network (GERAN) specification has<br>
been studying the feasibility of improved receiver performance under interference-limited<br>
conditions. Receivers compliant to such an improved performance specification would be<br>
required to maintain a specified demodulation performance - defined, for example, in<br>
terms of a reference bit error rate (BER), frame error rate (FER), or block error rate<br>
(BLER) - at a lower desired carrier to interfering signal power ratio or equivalently C/I<br>
ratio than conventional receivers. Typically, this is achieved by implementing<br>
interference-canceling receiver architectures which are designed to mitigate the effects of<br>
particular interfering waveforms, e.g. transmissions to other GSM and EDGE mobile or<br>
base stations, on the desired signal demodulation process.<br>
Any requirement for improved demodulation performance in EGPRS links<br>
(enabled by interference canceling receivers) also implies however, that modulation<br>
detection performance must also be improved if that aspect of receiver operation is not to<br>
become the performance-limiting component. That is, there is a need for an improved<br>
method of modulation detection for EGPRS transmissions (or more generally, for any<br>
transmission requiring modulation detection) when the associated receiver demodulation<br>
function is capable of enhanced performance in interference-limited conditions. It would<br>
also be advantageous if the method for achieving this was a low-complexity solution,<br>
capable of being implemented on a programmable device without necessarily requiring<br>
new hardware resources.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Although the disclosure is described in terms of one embodiment of EGPRS<br>
modulation detection, it will be appreciated that the invention is broadly applicable to<br><br><br>
situations where the modulation type of the transmission is not already known or<br>
explicitly signaled to the receiver.<br>
According to one embodiment, the disclosure provides a method for improving<br>
modulation detection in a GSM communication system. The method uses an embedded<br>
interference-canceling algorithm in constructing the decision statistic to drive the<br>
hypothesis test underlying the modulation detection decision. The method can include a<br>
first step of establishing an error metric based on an estimate of the training sequence<br>
generated by a quasi-linear filter, conditioned on the hypothesized modulation type, and<br>
then a second step of comparing the decision statistic associated with each modulation<br>
type in order to determine the modulation. As a third step, the error metrics generated by<br>
the first step under each hypothesis may be accumulated to generate error metrics by<br>
which the modulation type associated with each Radio Link Control (RLC) block may be<br>
identified.<br>
According to a related embodiment, the disclosure provides a method of<br>
modulation detection. The method can include receiving a signal, generating a first<br>
decision statistic based on the received signal, phase rotating the received signal,<br>
generating a second decision statistic based on the phase rotated received signal, and<br>
determining a selected modulation type based on comparing the first decision statistic<br>
with the second decision statistic. The method can also include generating an observation<br>
matrix from the received signal, wherein the first decision statistic is generated based on<br>
the observation matrix. The method can additionally include generating an observation<br>
matrix from the phase-rotated received signal, wherein the second decision statistic is<br>
generated based on the observation matrix. The step of detennining a selected<br>
modulation type can include comparing the first decision statistic with the second<br>
decision statistic, determining a desired modulation to be a first modulation type if the<br>
first decision statistic is less than or equal to the second decision statistic, and<br>
determining a desired modulation to be a second modulation type if the second decision<br>
statistic is less than the first decision statistic. The step of detennining a selected<br>
modulation type can determine the selected modulation type to be a Gaussian minimum<br><br>
shift keying modulation type, an octal phase shift keying modulation type, or any other<br>
useful modulation type, based on comparing the first decision statistic with the second<br>
decision statistic. Generating a first decision statistic can include generating the first<br>
decision statistic based on four bursts comprising a radio link control bock of the received<br>
signal. The first decision statistic can be generated according to<br>
  The second decision statistic can be generated according<br><br>
According to a related embodiment, the disclosure provides a method of<br>
modulation detection. The method can include receiving a signal, constructing a first<br>
decision statistic based on a first hypothesized modulation type including interference<br>
suppression based on the received signal, constructing a second decision statistic based<br>
on a second hypothesized modulation type including interference suppression based on<br>
the received signal, and identifying a selected modulation type based on a comparison of<br>
the first decision statistic and the second decision statistic. The first hypothesized<br>
modulation type can be a Gaussian minimum shift keying modulation type. The second<br>
hypothesized modulation type can be an octal phase shift keying modulation type. The<br>
method can also include transforming the received signal where the second decision<br>
statistic can be based on transformed received signal. Transforming the received signal<br>
can include phase rotating the received signal or any other useful transformation. The<br>
first decision statistic can be generated according to  The<br>
second decision statistic can be generated according to <br>
Identifying a selected modulation type can include comparing the first decision statistic<br>
with the second decision statistic, determining a desired modulation to be a first<br>
modulation type if the first decision statistic is less than or equal to the second decision<br>
statistic, and determining a desired modulation to be a second modulation type if the first<br>
decision statistic is greater than the second decision statistic. The first modulation type<br>
can be a Gaussian minimum shift keying modulation type, an octal phase shift keying<br>
modulation type, or any other useful modulation type. Constructing a first decision<br><br>
statistic can include constructing the first decision statistic based on four bursts<br>
comprising a radio link control bock of the received signal.<br>
According to a related embodiment, the disclosure provides a method of<br>
modulation detection. The method can include receiving a signal, generating a first<br>
observation matrix from the received signal, computing first decision statistic from first<br>
observation matrix, phase-rotating the received signal, generating a second observation<br>
matrix from the phase-rotated received signal, computing a second decision statistic from<br>
the second observation matrix, comparing the first decision statistic with the second<br>
decision statistic, determining a desired modulation to be a Gaussian minimum shift<br>
keying modulation if the first statistic is less than or equal to the second statistic, and<br>
determining a desired modulation to be an octal phase shift keying modulation if the<br>
second statistic is less than the first statistic.<br>
Fig. 1 is an exemplary illustration of a normal burst 100, which is the basic unit of<br>
transmission for both circuit- and packet-switched GSM logical channels. Other burst<br>
formats are defined in GSM, but can be reserved for signaling, frequency correction or<br>
other purposes. The format of the normal burst 100 can comprise two tail bit fields,<br>
denoted 'T', of length equal to 3 symbols, two encrypted data fields ('Data') of length-58<br>
symbols, the midamble or training sequence code (TSC) of length 26 symbols, and the<br>
guard interval, denoted 'G', of nominal length 8.25 symbols. The symbols comprising<br>
the burst can be, for example, either binary or octal (i.e. 8-ary) symbols, depending on<br>
whether the Gaussian Minimum Shift Keying (GMSK) or octal phase shift keying (8-<br>
PSK) modulation types are used.<br>
Fig. 2 is an exemplary table 200 of a binary-valued symbol sequence comprising<br>
each element of the set of available training sequence codes according to one<br>
embodiment. For normal bursts, a total of eight selectable TSC fields are defined in<br>
GSM networks and known to both the transmitter and receiver before transmission<br>
commences. Each individual length-26 TSC comprises a sequence of cyclically-<br>
extended binary codewords with a fundamental length of 16 symbols, and which exhibit<br><br>
good cyclic autocorrelation properties. For the present purpose, the binary symbol<br>
sequence corresponding to the particular TSC selected from Fig. 2 is denoted b'k.<br>
When GMSK modulation is used to transmit the normal burst, transmission of the<br>
midamble is performed, as for the data, tail and guard fields, according to principles of<br>
GMSK modulation in the GSM system. That is, the binary symbols comprising the TSC<br>
are differentially encoded, and then phase-modulated according to principles of minimum<br>
shift keying with a Gaussian pre-filter with a bandwidth-time (BT) product of 0.3.<br>
Fig. 3 is an exemplary illustration of real-valued elements of a Gray-encoded 8-<br>
PSK constellation 300 according to one embodiment. When 8-PSK modulation is used to<br>
transmit the normal burst, each binary symbol of the selected TSC is first mapped onto<br>
the real-valued elements of a Gray-encoded 8-PSK constellation. That is, a TSC symbol<br>
'0' is mapped to constellation element '111' and a TSC symbol' 1' is mapped to<br>
constellation element '001'. The resulting complex-valued symbols are then subject to a<br>
per-symbol phase-shift of 3π/8 radians before linear pulse-shaping, frequency<br>
conversion, and transmission.<br>
When discriminating between GMSK and 8-PSK modulated bursts, the primary<br>
task of a receiver is to select which of the two alternate representations of the same<br>
fundamental training sequence b'k has been received. No other explicit signaling<br>
distinction is made between GMSK and 8-PSK formatted bursts.<br>
Consider next the modulation detection problem in the context of an interference<br>
canceling (IC) receiver. It is useful here to first briefly describe the fundamentals of a<br>
particular IC GSM receiver used in the embodiment described below, although other<br>
interference-canceling receiver designs can also be used. In the description below,<br>
quantities represent the transposition, conjugate transposition, and inversion<br>
of matrices, respectively, and bold letters indicate vectors or matrices.<br>
In more detail, one method to reject co-channel and adjacent channel interference<br>
in a GSM system is to use a quasi-linear finite-impulse-response (FIR) filter trained using<br><br>
the training sequence. This uses the linear approximation to GMSK modulation, which<br>
permits an approximately-equivalent transmitted symbol sequence ak to be defined as:<br><br>
In other words, when GMSK modulation is used, each transmitted symbol ak in the<br>
GSM system can be viewed as a binary antipodal constellation occupying alternately the<br>
in-phase (I) or quadrature (Q) signal component<br>
Viewed simply in terms of symbol-rate sampling, by using the training sequence<br>
region of the received signal r„, which corresponds to the received<br>
training sequence of the first hypothesized arriving ray of the received signal, a quasi-<br>
linear estimator of the transmitted symbol sequence can be constructed by minimizing a<br>
modified sum-squared error metric over the TSC defined as:<br><br>
where ak is restricted to be purely real or purely imaginary, in accordance with<br>
Again, in more detail, defining the binary antipodal form of the training sequence as<br>
  , and the quasi-linear estimate of and defining the length- N<br>
observation vector y (k), or equivalently y k, input to the quasi-linear estimator as:<br><br>
then the quasi-linear estimate th training symbol bk_N+1 is formed<br>
(over the training sequence interval according to:<br><br><br><br>
where w is a complex-valued, length- N weight vector, and function F1(x), which<br>
varies according to the estimated symbol index, generates either the real or imaginary<br>
part of its argument according to:<br><br>
By decomposing the weight and observation vectors into their respective real and<br>
imaginary components - i.e. simply that - and noting<br>
  , the weight vector w can be<br>
computed to minimize the estimation error over the training sequence<br><br>
where:<br><br><br>
and where b is a vector of training sequence elements is an estimate of b, D = 61<br>
is the index of the first training sequence symbol, and and ire respectively the<br>
real and imaginary parts of w.<br>
Equation (1.7) can be solved using, for example, the classical least-squares approach,<br>
to generate the optimal solution vector w as:<br><br>
Notably, the error metric e over the midamble (defined in equation (1.2), or<br>
equivalently in equation (1.6)) can then be computed in terms of the observation matrix<br>
Z and the training sequence vector b according to:<br><br>
That is, is a measure of the square-error between the training sequence and the<br>
estimate of the training sequence that would have resulted had the training sequence<br>
estimate been compared with the actual training sequence bk over the training<br>
sequence interval. It is thus a useful measure on which to base a hypothesis test to select<br>
between modulation types, and it has the additional advantage that since quasi-linear<br>
estimation of the type described above is capable of interference suppression, the<br>
hypothesis test benefits from the incorporation of interference suppression in the<br>
generation of the hypothesis test decision statistic.<br>
In the present context, this approach to interference suppression can also be<br>
applied to the problem of modulation detection in EGPRS links by incorporating the error<br>
metric of equation (1.6) into a hypothesis test used as the basis of the modulation<br>
detection procedure.<br><br>
Fig. 4 is an exemplary flowchart 400 outlining the operation of constructing a<br>
modulation detection decision statistic used to discriminate modulation types according<br>
to one embodiment. In step 405, the flowchart 400 begins. Let hypothesis H0<br>
correspond to the case where a transmitted burst uses GMSK modulation, while<br>
hypothesis H1 corresponds to the 8-PSK modulated case. In step 415, under hypothesis<br>
H0, where the burst is assumed to be GMSK-modulated, the signal corresponding to the<br>
training sequence observed at the output of the multipath channel is:<br><br>
where hk is the desired signal multipath channel impulse response of length L, and bk is<br>
the binary TSC symbol sequence.<br>
In step 430, under hypothesis Hi that the burst uses 8-PSK modulation, the<br>
observed signal rn corresponding to the training sequence is given by:<br><br>
One approach to modulation detection constructs the decision statistic for the<br>
hypothesis test by first computing the square-error between the observation r„ and<br>
signals generated respectively by combining the knowledge of the training<br>
sequence bk with the estimates of the multipath channel generated under<br>
hypotheses H0 and Ht in steps 410 and 425 using, for example, correlation, least-<br>
squares channel estimation methods, or the like. In step 420, the decision statistic e0<br>
under H0 is defined by:<br><br><br>
where the formulation of follows that of equation (1.10) with hk replaced by channel<br>
estimate <br>
Similarly, in step 435, the decision statistic under Ht is defined by:<br><br>
with following the definition of equation (1.11) with \ again replaced by channel<br>
estimate  In steps 440,445, and 450, hypothesis H0 is then selected if <br>
otherwise hypothesis H1 is selected. In step 455, the flowchart 400 ends.<br>
According to another embodiment, rather than using this decision statistic, the<br>
alternate decision statistic defined in equation (1.6) is used. Before describing the<br>
application of this metric to the problem of modulation detection, however, one further<br>
observation is useful concerning the structure of the observed 8-PSK signal under<br>
hypothesisH1,.<br>
As described above in equation (1.11), under H1 the 8-PSK modulated received<br>
sequence rn is given by:<br><br>
If a phase rotation using operator is applied to the observed burst then<br>
it can be seen that the resulting observation data sequence has the form:<br><br><br>
Comparison of equation (1.15) with equation (1.10) shows that, after rotation using<br>
operator , and within the bounds of the linearised GMSK approximation, and<br>
  have an identical form, with the exception that the effective channel impulse '<br>
response is modified to be <br>
Accordingly, the same processing applicable under hypothesis H0 to the GMSK<br>
observation , is also applicable under hypothesis H1 to the phase-rotated 8-PSK<br>
observation <br>
Fig. 5 is an exemplary flowchart 500 outlining a burst modulation detection<br>
method according to another embodiment. In step 505, the flowchart begins. In step<br>
510, the observation matrix Z0 is populated directly from the received signal r„ in<br>
accordance with the definition of Z in equation (1.7), and the definition of vector y in<br>
equation (1.3).<br>
In step 515, an error metric, such as a decision statistic, s0 is generated under<br>
hypothesis H0 (GMSK modulation), where s0 is defined according to equation (1.9):<br><br>
In step 520, the signal is generated for hypothesis 27, by phase-<br>
rotating the received signal using operator <br><br>
In step 525, matrix Z1 is populated from the modified signal in accordance<br>
with the definition of Z in equation (1.7), and the definition of vector y in equation (1.3)<br>
where rk in equation (1.3) is replaced with rk.<br>
In step 530, the error metric is computed under hypothesis H1 (8-PSK<br>
modulation) according to:<br><br>
In step 535, the error metric for hypothesis H1 is compared to the error metric<br>
ex for hypothesis H1. In step 540, the hypothesis H0 (i.e. declare GMSK burst<br>
modulation) is selected if otherwise, in step 545, hypothesis H1 is selected (i.e.<br>
declare 8-PSK burst modulation). In step 550, the flowchart ends.<br>
The performance of the method of modulation detection described herein can be<br>
understood by reference to Fig. 6, which shows RLC block detection performance 600<br>
for a Typical Urban multipath channel at 1.5km/h mobile station velocity. It can be seen<br>
mat while using an existing method 610, the probability of identifying an RLC block<br>
transmitted using GMSK as an 8PSK-modulated block is 1% at a carrier to co-channel<br>
interference ratio (C/I) of approximately 9dB, whereas another disclosed modulation<br>
detection method 620 achieves the same performance at an improved C/I ratio of<br>
approximately -5dB.<br>
Fig. 7 is an exemplary flowchart 700 outlining the operation of the disclosed<br>
method according to another embodiment. In step 705, the flowchart begins. In step<br>
710, a signal is received. According to an alternate embodiment, the signal may include<br>
EGPRS Radio Link Control (RLC) data blocks distributed over four normal bursts. For<br>
example, noting that EGPRS RLC data blocks are distributed over tour normal bursts,<br>
and further noting that the same modulation type is applied to each burst comprising an<br>
RLC block, a step 710 can include RLC block modulation identification. Thus, under the<br><br>
extended hypothesis  that an RLC block is transmitted using GMSK modulation,<br>
accumulate s0 over the 4 bursts comprising the RLC block to generate block error metric<br>
  . Similarly, under the extended hypothesis that an RLC block is transmitted<br>
using 8-PSK modulation, accumulate over the 4 bursts comprising the RLC block to<br>
generate block error metric . Select (GMSK modulation) if , else<br>
select (8-PSK modulation). In step 715, a first observation matrix is generated<br>
based on the received signal. In step 720, a first decision statistic is constructed based on<br>
the first observation matrix. In step 725, the received signal is transformed. For<br>
example, the received signal may be phase rotated or otherwise transformed. In step 730,<br>
a second observation matrix is generated based on the transformed received signal. In<br>
step 735, a second decision statistic is constructed based on the second observation<br>
matrix. In step 740, the first decision statistic and the second decision statistic are<br>
compared. A first modulation type is selected in step 745 or a second modulation type is<br>
selected in step 750 based on the comparison. In step 753, the signal can be demodulated<br>
according to the selected modulation type. In step 755, the flowchart 700 ends<br>
Fig. 8 is an exemplary block diagram of a system 800 according to one<br>
