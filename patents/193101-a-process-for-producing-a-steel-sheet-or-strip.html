The present invention relates to a process for producing a steel sheet or strip for making a can obtained by  drawing  and  ironing,  of  the  beverage  can  type.<br>
The present invention also relates to a steel sheet or strip  for  making  a  can  obtained  by  drawing  and  ironing  .<br>
This type of can usually comprises a bottom, a thin peripheral wall and a neck for achieving the setting or seaming of a lid, which may be of the easily-opened type, and is produced in particular by drawing and ironing a cup cut  from  a  metal  sheet  or  strip.<br>
For this purpose, the cup is subjected first of all to a drawing operation with a relatively severe reduction on a press which comprises in the conventional manner, on one hand, a fixed punch and a support forming a peripheral blank holder which is slidable around said punch and on which the cup rests, and, on the other hand, a die to be applied against the cup with a force transmitted vertically by  an  upper  slide.<br>
The cup, comprising a bottom and a flange formed by the drawing operation, is then either calibrated by a light drawing operation without the use of a blank holder, or redrawn with a blank holder and is then subjected to an ironing operation which comprises drawing the flange, by means of a draw die with successive reductions, so as to progressively  form  the  thin  peripheral  wall  of  the  can.<br><br>
Thereafter, the bottom is formed on the draw die so as to impart thereto a given geometry and the neck of the thin peripheral wall is formed in accordance with two methods, namely a necking method with a die, named die-necking, or a necking method employing a forming roller, named spin necking  .<br>
The method for necking with a die comprises forcing the neck into a die having a conical inlet profile and a cylindrical outlet profile. A cylindrical element guides the  formed  wall  as  it  leaves  the  die.<br>
The force required to permit the deformation of the metal is derived from the thrust applied on the bottom of the can and axially transmitted by its thin peripheral wall.<br>
To reach the desired inside diameter, a plurality of successive reductions are required, each being a distinct forming step. When the reduction in diameter is obtained, flanging  is  usually  effected  with  flanging  rollers.<br>
The spin-necking method employing a forming roller comprises driving the can in rotation while it is maintained  between  a  pusher  and  a  centring  ring.<br>
The free end of the thin peripheral wall is engaged on a mandrel and two axially travelling rollers form the neck of the can which progressively leaves the mandrel while always being maintained between the pusher and the centring ring.<br>
The     profile     of     the     neck     is     obtained     by     the<br><br>
simultaneous   displacements    of    the    rollers,    the    centring ring  and  the  pusher.<br>
Subsequent to these various operations, the can is filled and a lid, for example of the easily-opened type, is set  or  seamed  on  the  neck  of  the  can.<br>
It is known to use for making this type of can a steel sheet or strip of extra-soft steel type the composition of which  in  percentage  by  weight  is  the  following  :<br>
Carbon  of  the  order  of  0.030  to  0.040  % Manganese  of  the  order  of  0.15  to  0.25  % Nitrogen  of  the  order  of  0.004  to  0.006  % Aluminium  of  the  order  of  0.03  to  0.05  % Phosphorus  less  than  0.015  % Sulphur  less  than  O.O20  % Silicon  less  than  0.020  %,<br>
a maximum of 0.08 % of one or more elements selected from copper, nickel and chromium, the remainder being  iron  and  residual  impurities.<br>
The sheet or the strip is produced by a process in which the slab issuing from a continuous casting operation is hot rolled, then cold rolled to obtain a thin sheet or foil which is subjected to a recrystallization annealing operation  at  a  temperature  below Acl.<br>
This process permits obtaining a thin sheet or foil which has a final thickness of about 0.30 mm, and making from this sheet a can whose thin peripheral wall has, after drawing    and    ironing,  a  thickness  of  the  order  of  0.1  ram.<br><br>
Now, manufacturers of cans, for reasons of economy and increased productivity, aim at producing cans of reduced weight,   i.e.  with  thinner  walls.<br>
In order to enable the can with thinner walls to withstand the pressure of the liquids it contains, particularly when it concerns a gaseous beverage, and in order to ensure that the can itself has a sufficient strength, steels of improved mechanical characteristics must  be  used.<br>
In order to improve the mechanical characteristics, manufacturing firms have, with the use of an extra-soft steel of the aforementioned composition, subjected a slab to a hot rolling and to a cold rolling to obtain a sheet which is subjected to a recrystallization annealing at a temperature  below Acl,  and  is  then  cold  rerolled.<br>
But it is known that a reduction in the thickness or an improvement in the mechanical characteristics of sheets or strips accentuates the phenomena of creasing when making the  cans.<br>
Tests have shown that this process results in a narrowing of the range of drawability of the sheet or the strip  and  an  increase  in  the  earring  coefficient.<br>
A narrower drawability range results in difficulties in the forming of the bottom and is the origin of the appearance  of  wrinkles    during  the  drawing  operation.<br>
In order to avoid the formation of wrinkles when drawing,   the   pressure   exerted   by   the   blank   holder   on   the<br><br>
sheet blank may be increased, but this increase in the pressure of the blank holder creates a problem of the control of the flow of the metal during the drawing and may consequently cause the metal to fracture or tear, particularly in the region of the connection or corner radii.<br>
Further, the increase in the earing coefficient creates a problem when removing the can from the draw punch,   i.e.  during  the  stripping  operation.<br>
Indeed, this operation is carried out by sliding a ring along the draw punch so that it can bear against the free  edge  of  the    thin  peripheral  wall  of  the  can.<br>
When the thin peripheral wall of the body of the can has large earings, the stripping ring only bears against a few points of the peripheral wall and very often there occurs a creasing of the peripheral wall during the stripping  and  the  can  must  be  scrapped.<br>
In order to reduce the earing coefficient, it is known to coil up the sheet in the hot state before the cold rolling  and  recrystallization  annealing.<br>
But this additional operation results in drawbacks since the edges of the sheet or strip are in direct contact with the surrounding air and cool quicker than the centre part.<br>
This natural cooling differential between the edges and the centre results in a heterogeneity of the mechanical characteristics    of    the    sheet    or    strip.     Moreover,     the<br><br>
coiling   up   of   the   sheet   in   the   hot   state   results   in   the<br>
formation  of  a  coarse  cementite.<br>
The  coarse  cementite  may  result  in  the  piercing  of  the<br>
thin   peripheral   wall   when   forming   the   neck   and   a   tearing<br>
away   of   this   metal   during   the   drawing   operation   owing   to<br>
hard  particles  in  the  steel.<br>
Further,   the  presence  of   hard   particles   in   the   steel<br>
results   in   a   premature   wear   of   the   various   drawing   and<br>
ironing  tools.<br>
Consequently,    manufacturers    are    faced    with    serious<br>
problems   which   are   often   antinomic   when   they   attempt   to<br>
reduce  the  thickness  of  the  walls  of  the  cans.<br>
An  object  of  the  invention  is  to  avoid  these  drawbacks<br>
by  providing  a  process   for  producing  a  sheet  or  strip   for<br>
making  a  can  obtained  by  drawing  and   ironing  which  permits<br>
reducing    the    thickness    of    the    walls    of    the    can    and<br>
consequently  achieving  a  saving  in weight.<br>
The  invention  provides  a  process  for  producing  a  sheet<br>
or  strip  for  making  a  can  obtained  by  drawing  and   ironing,<br>
of  the  beverage  can  type,   from  a  steel  having  the  following<br>
composition  in  percentage  by  weight  :<br>
Carbon  less  than  0.008  % Manganese  between  0.10  and  0.30  % Nitrogen  less  than  0.006  % Aluminium between  0.01  and  0.06  % Phosphorus  less  than  0.015  % Sulphur  less  than  O.O20  %<br><br>
silicon  less  than  0.020  %<br>
a maximum of 0.08 % of one or more of the elements selected from copper, nickel and chromium, the remainder being iron and residual impurities, in which process the slab is hot rolled into a hot sheet or band having a thickness of less than 3 mm, then the hot sheet or the band is cold rolled with a reduction of between 83 and 92 % and subjected to a recrystallization annealing at a temperature lower than Acl and finally cold rerolled with a reduction  of  between  10  and  40%.<br>
The invention also provides a steel sheet or strip for making a can obtained by drawing and ironing, of the beverage can type, characterized in that it is obtained by the  aforementioned  process.<br>
A better understanding of the invention will be had from the following description given solely by way of example.<br>
The manufacturer of a can, of the beverage can type, by drawing and ironing comprises cutting a blank from a steel sheet or strip, then drawing this blank with a relatively  severe  reduction  to  form  a  cup.<br>
Thereafter, the cup comprising a bottom and a flange is calibrated and subjected to an ironing comprising drawing the flange with successive reductions to form progressively  the  peripheral  wall  of  the  can.<br>
The bottom is then formed so as to impart thereto the given  geometry  and  the  neck  of  the  thin  peripheral  wall   is<br><br>
formed either by a necking method with a die, the die necking method, or by a necking method employing a forming roller,  the  spin-necking  method.<br>
In order to be able to manufacture a can having very thin walls, the invention proposes producing this type of can by said drawing and ironing operation from a very low carbon steel having the following composition in percentage by  weight   :<br>
Carbon  less  than  0.008  %<br>
Manganese  between  0.10  and  0.30  %<br>
Nitrogen  less  than  0.006  %<br>
Aluminium between  0.01  and  0.06  %<br>
Phosphorus  less  than  0.015  %<br>
Sulphur  less  than  O.O20  %<br>
Silicon  less  than  0.020  %<br>
a maximum of 0.08 % of one or more of the elements selected from the copper, nickel and chromium, the remainder being iron and residual impurities, in which process the slab is hot rolled into a hot sheet or strip having a thickness of less than 3 mm, then the hot sheet or strip is cold rolled with a reduction of between 83 and 92 % and subjected to a recrystallization annealing at a temperature below Acl and finally cold rerolled with a reduction  of  between  10  and  40%.<br>
The slab is hot rolled into a sheet having a thickness of between 1.8 and 2.5 mm and preferably between 2 and 2.4   mm,   then  the   sheet   is   cold  rolled  with   such  reduction<br><br>
as to bring the sheet to a thickness of between 0.26 and 0.32 mm and subjected to a recrystallization annealing at a temperature below Acl and lastly cold rerolled with a reduction of between 28 and 35 % to bring the sheet to a thickness  of  between  0.18  and  0.22  mm.<br>
The recrystallization annealing is a continuous annealing.<br>
In order to be able to produce a thin steel sheet or strip having a thickness between 0.18 and 0.22 mm and having all the characteristics required for making cans, namely drawn and ironed cans the walls of which have a thickness equal to and even less than 0.07 mm, it was realized that it is necessary to use a very low carbon steel having a carbon content lower, in percentage by weight, than 0.008 % and to produce this steel in accordance with the double reduction method, i.e. to subject the hot rolled sheet or strip to a cold rolling followed by a recrystallization annealing and a cold rerolling.<br>
Surprisingly, it was realized that to achieve the optimum mechanical characteristics to permit carrying out the drawing and ironing necessary to obtain a can whose walls have a thickness equal to 0.07 mm, the reduction produced by the first cold rolling of the sheet or strip had  to  be  reduced.<br>
Indeed, for example if there is examined the earing coefficient     of   a  steel   sheet  or  strip  which  was   produced<br><br>
from  a  steel  having  the  following  composition   in  percentage by  weight   :<br>
Carbon  0.003  %<br>
Manganese  0.204  %<br>
Phosphorus  0.009  %<br>
Sulphur  0.009  %<br>
Nitrogen  0.003  %<br>
Silicon  0.002  %<br>
Copper  0.008  %<br>
Nickel  0.021  %<br>
Chromium  0.017  %<br>
Aluminium  0.027  %<br>
the remainder being iron, and which was hot rolled to obtain a hot rolled strip 2.3 mm thick, then cold rolled to obtain a strip 0.26 mm thick, and continously annealed at a temperature below Acl and finally cold rerolled to bring this strip to a thickness of 0.18 mm, the earing  coefficient  is  equal  to  -  0.2.<br>
On the other hand, a sheet or strip which was produced from the same steel but hot rolled to bring it to a thickness of 1.8 mm then cold rolled to obtain a strip 0.26 mm thick, then continuously annealed under the same conditions and cold rerolled to bring it to a thickness of 0.18 mm, has a earing rate equal to - 0.05, which is a coefficient very close to 0 and therefore represents a steel  having  a  very  low  tendency  to  form  earings.<br><br>
It is therefore particularly important to conform to the rates of cold rolling and rerolling after annealing and to apply a high hot rolling rate so as to produce a hot rolled strip having a thickness of less than 3 mm and preferably  between  1.8  and  2.5  mm.<br>
Apart from this aspect concerning the process for obtaining the strip, it is also necessary to use a steel having a very low carbon content to be able to produce very thin,  drawn  and  ironed  cans.<br>
In the following table 1, different steel compositions are indicated, the steels A to F being very low carbon steels, i.e. steels having a carbon percentage lower than 0.006  %,  and  the  steels  G  and  H  extra-mild  steels.<br><br><br><br>
Slabs each having one of the compositions indicated in the foregoing table 1, were subjected to a treatment comprising hot rolling each slab into a sheet then cold rolling this sheet and subjecting it to a recrystallization annealing at a temperature below Acl, and finally a cold rerolling.<br>
The steel sheets or strips obtained by this process were subjected to tests in order to determine the yield strengths Y.S and the ultimate tensile strengths U.T.S in the direction of the length and in the transverse direction,  and  the  earing  coefficient  AC.<br>
The  results  are  indicated  in  the  following  table  2.<br><br><br><br>
This table shows that the steels G and H, although they satisfy the rolling conditions of the process according to the invention, have a coefficient AC further from  0  than  the  steels  B,  C,  E.<br>
Indeed, the steel B and the steel H were subjected to similar hot rolling, cold rolling, annealing and cold rerolling conditions. However, the steel H has higher yield strength and ultimate tensile strength values and above all a  very  much  lower  AC    which  is  much  further  from  0.<br>
Likewise, although the steel G was subjected to a cold rolling rate of 86 % and a rerolling rate of 11 % which are lower than those to which steel C was subjected, the AC of steel  G  is  further  from  0  than  the  AC  of  steel  C.<br>
Further, with the cold rolling rate of steel B at 85 % and that of steel D at 90.7 % and as these two steels were subjected to the same rerolling after annealing, the AC aniso of steel D is 0.24 and the AC aniso of steel B is -  0.06.<br>
Therefore, the steel sheet or strip of very low carbon content lower than 0.008 % produced by the process according to the invention, i.e. with a hot rolling, a cold rolling with a reduction of between 83 and 92 %, then a recrystallization annealing at a temperature below Acl and finally a cold rerolling with a reduction of between 10 and 40 %, has a yield strength in the direction of the length of between 350 and 450 MPa for a final thickness of about 0.22  mm,   between  440  and  540  MPa  for  a   final   thickness   of<br><br>
about   0.20   mm   and   between   500   and   600    MPa    for   a    final thickness  of  about  0.18  mm.<br>
The sheets or strips according to the invention may also be characterized by the fact that the number of grains of ferrite per mm^ is between 10000 and 30000 and preferably between 15000 and 25000, which corresponds to a very small grain  size.<br>
This is important for the regularity of the characteristics of the metal throughout the length of the coil, and for avoiding the antinomic drawbacks with regard to  the  drawing,  the  ironing  and  the  forming  of  the  neck.<br>
The process for producing a sheet according to the invention also permits retaining a given quantity of carbon in  solution  in  the  sheet.<br>
Such a sheet therefore has the characteristic of hardening in a significant manner when staving the varnish carried  out  on  the  can  after  it  has  been  put  into  shape.<br>
This characteristic is very important in the case of the manufacture of cans obtained by drawing and ironing since the sheet according to the process of the invention has adequate mechanical characteristics for facilitating the forming of the can, the mechanical characteristics varying  little  with  respect  to  time.<br>
Once the can has been formed, varnished and subjected to the stoving of the varnish, the mechanical characteristics are significantly improved, which has the advantage  of  increasing  the  strength  of  the  can.<br><br>
This strength of the can is in particular characterized by the pressure for inverting the dome of the bottom  of  the  can.<br>
This inverting pressure, which is the limit pressure beyond which the dome produced on the bottom of the can is inverted, increases by about 10 % after stoving and changes for  example  from  6.3  to  6.9  bars  for  a  given  type  of  can.<br>
This is particularly the case for the cold rerolling rate,  after  annealing  the  sheet,  of  between  10  and  30  %.<br>
In this way, the process according to the invention for producing a steel sheet or strip having a very low carbon content for making a can, of the beverage can type, obtained by drawing and ironing, permits reducing the thickness of the walls of the can and achieving a saving in weight of about 30 % on the sheet or strip, while widening the range of drawability and reducing the earing coefficient and the risk of the formation of wrinkles when drawing  the  can.<br><br><br><br>
