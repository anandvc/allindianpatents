Title: "Method for controlling a refrigeration appliance"<br>
The present invention relates to a method for controlling the defrost cycle of an<br>
evaporator in a refrigeration appliance provided with one or more actuators, in<br>
which a temperature sensor is used for detecting the temperature inside a cavity<br>
of the appliance. With the term "actuator" we mean any device which is driven by<br>
the  control  circuit  of the  appliance,  for instance  the  compressor of the<br>
refrigeration circuit, movable dampers, fans, electrical resistance for defrosting<br>
etc.<br>
All the static evaporators used for refrigerator cabinets are provided with a<br>
temperature sensor directly in contact with them. Said sensor is used by the<br>
temperature controller not only to control the temperature in the cavity but also to<br>
detect the end of the defrost phase. This is done by comparing its temperature<br>
with an appropriated value (in general higher than 0Â°C). For this purpose, both<br>
electromechanical sensors (thermostats) and electronic sensors (i.e. NTC, PTC,<br>
thermocouples...) can be used. In some cases a second temperature sensor is<br>
placed inside the refrigerator cavity to provide the control algorithm with a more<br>
precise cavity temperature.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to remove the evaporator temperature<br>
sensor in order to save the cost related to its assembly and to solve the<br>
serviceability problems related to its inaccessible location.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a refrigerator with a single<br>
temperature sensor placed inside its cavity, which can perform a defrost cycle<br>
substantially identical to the defrost cycle performed by refrigeration appliances<br>
having a temperature sensor in contact with the evaporator.<br>
The above objects are obtained thanks to the features listed in the appended<br>
claims.<br>
According to the invention, the evaporator temperature sensor is replaced with<br>
an estimation algorithm able to estimate the evaporator temperature and the frost<br>
formation on the basis of a unique temperature sensor placed in a more<br><br>
accessible position inside the cavity. The estimation algorithm is able to estimate the evaporator temperature and its frost condition in order to manage the defrost function avoiding ice accumulation with no direct measure on the evaporator surface nor in its closeness.<br>
The main advantages of the present invention come from the elimination of the temperature sensor traditionally present on all the static evaporators of refrigerators. These advantages can be summarized in an assembly cost saving and increased serviceability. An additional saving can be obtained if the invention is applied to a refrigerator cabinet that is traditionally provided with two temperature sensors: one on the evaporator to manage the defrost and one on the ambient to control the temperature. In this case the invention allows the elimination of the first sensor and the second one will be used for both purposes (defrost and temperature control).<br>
The present invention will be disclosed in detail with reference to the appended drawings, in which:<br>

a static refrigerator cavity (solutions "a" and "b") and of a possible sensor<br>
position according to the present invention (solution V);<br>

thermodynamic model is shown;<br>

invention;<br><br>

Figure 8 is a diagram showing examples of actual performances of the<br>
algorithm according to the invention applied to a refrigeration appliance<br>
with and without humid load inside the cavity; and<br>
Figure 9 shows an example of parameter values used in the algorithm<br>
according to the invention. With reference to the drawings, in figure 2 it is shown a general block diagram describing the interactions between the estimation algorithm EA, the control algorithm CA and the refrigerator system RS. According to this diagram the control algorithm CA decides the status of the actuators (for instance the compressor of the refrigeration circuit) in order to guarantee an appropriated temperature control and a correct functioning of the appliance (including a good defrost management). This is done mainly on the basis of two input: the measured temperature coming from the temperature probe TP in the cavity, and the estimated evaporator conditions (for example evaporator temperature and frost amount) carried out by the estimation algorithm EA.<br>
Figure 3 shows the block scheme of the estimation algorithm EA in a more detailed way. The estimation algorithm EA is composed of two main blocks M and K. The "model" block M consists of a mathematical model of the appliance. It can be obtained from the application of the thermodynamic and physical principles describing heat exchange between the probe area and the evaporator area. Alternatively or in addition to such kind of solution, computational intelligence techniques (such as neural network) can be used to implement the model block M.<br>
The "error" block K weights the error between the measured probe temperature and the estimated one and it sends this data as a feedback to the model block M. This feedback is used by the model M block to adjust the estimations. The presence of the error block K is justified by the presence of a certain degree of uncertainty that affects the system. Such uncertainty is related to the presence of disturbances (figure 2) and to the inevitable approximation of the model block<br><br>
M in describing the real system. The higher is the uncertainty, the higher the importance of the error block K will be. If the effects of the uncertainty are considered negligible, the error block K can be omitted.<br>
Example of disturbances are the opening of the door, the presence of warm food (especially if adjacent to the temperature probe TP), the external temperature variations, the humidity conditions (inside and outside the cavity). The disturbances, by definition, can't be directly measured but the estimation algorithm EA can detect and estimate them to adjust the estimation by consequence. For example, by analyzing the probe temperature dynamics the estimation algorithm EA can recognize the presence of food inside the cavity and modify the parameters of the internal model block M by consequence. The error block K can be used also for self-tuning the mathematical model M, so that the estimation algorithm can be adapted automatically to the specific refrigerator model. In this way a single software can be used for a wide range of refrigerator models.<br>
A well-known technique to design blocks M and K consists on the application of the Kalman filtering technique.<br>
According to the present invention, the control algorithm will use the estimated evaporator status to manage the evaporator defrost This can be done for example by enabling the compressor startup, after each cooling cycle, just when the estimated evaporator temperature is greater than a fixed threshold. In this case the defrost should be done at each compressor cycling. Alternatively, the defrost could be done just when the estimated frost status (provided by the estimation algorithm EA) is greater than a pre-determined value. As said before one of the main advantages of the present invention is the reduction of the wiring and assembly costs thanks to the elimination of the traditional evaporator temperature sensor. This advantage can be further increased if most of all the electrical/electronics devices are concentrated on a unique control box CB inside the cavity (as shown in figure 4). Such control box CB can include for example the temperature probe P, the user interface (U(), the micro-controller implementing the estimation algorithm EA and the control<br><br>
algorithm CA, electronic and electrical drivers for the actuators (relays, triacs) and input sensors (door switch, temperature probe etc.).<br>
Even if the present invention is mainly applied to a static evaporator of a refrigerator cavity, it can be applied to no-frost evaporators (for refrigerators and freezer) as well. Traditionally, in these latter cases the evaporator is provided with a "bimetal" switch that acts as a temperature sensor. The status of the bimetal switch (open/closed) depends on the evaporator temperature and it is used by the control algorithm CA to detect the end of the defrost phase. The application of the technical solution according to the present invention would eliminate the bimetal switch.<br>
A practical implementation of the present invention will be now described in the following example, in which a Whirlpool refrigerator cabinet code 850169816000 was modified according to the invention. Figure 5 shows a schematic representation of this cabinet. The refrigerator cabinet of the example has an evaporator on the outside surface of the wall of the plastic liner. This is a very well known technique that has replaced the use of evaporators in the cell. The example is based on the "reference model" technique. This means that the estimation of the evaporator temperature is performed on the basis of a simplified mathematical model describing the ice formation and heat exchange effects between the evaporator and the cabinet. An equivalent electric scheme of this model is shown in the above-mentioned figure 5.<br>
According to this equivalence (electric-thermal), the resistance represents the inverse of a heat exchange coefficient (Â°C/W), and each capacitor represent a thermal capacity (J/Â°C). The current on the generic branch represents a thermal flux (W) along that branch and, finally, the voltage on the generic node represents the temperature on that node (Â°C).<br>
The boundary condition of the model consists of two generators (Qi and T3). The first one Qi describes the thermal flow rate carried away by the compressor. The second generator describes the temperature of the refrigerator cavity, and in this particular application it coincides with the probe temperature Tp.<br><br>
The two main state variables of the models are the two temperatures 7V and T2. The first one describes the temperature of inner evaporator block. The second one describes the temperature of the plastic wall (liner) that covers the evaporator. This is the most important temperature because it corresponds to the area affected by the ice formation, in addition, a third state variable state (x**) is present to describe the energy absorbed or released by the T2 node for the effect of the ice formation or melting. The equations of the model are as follows:<br><br>
The function U describes the cooling capacity of the compressor in function of the<br>
speed (if a variable speed compressor is used) and the estimated temperature<br>
T2.<br>
The Fan factor is used to describe the possible presence of a fan inside the<br>
cavity.<br>
The K coefficient takes in account the effect of the convective heat exchange<br>
between the cavity and the evaporator wall.<br><br>
The flow chart in figure 6 shows the estimation algorithm based on the described model. It consists on a numerical integration of the equation system (1). For the considered application, an integration time step Dt of 1 sec. was chosen. The algorithm is composed on the following main steps:<br>
1.	Input reading. Compressor speed (if variable speed compressor is<br>
used) or compressor status (if On/Off compressor is used), fan state or<br>
fan speed, probe temperature value (temperature T3).<br>
2.	Cooling capacity Qi computation. This is done through the 2d look-up<br>
table annexed to the flow chart. This look-up table was obtained from<br>
the compressor characteristics provided by the supplier (equation 4 of<br>
system (1)).<br>
3.	Integration of the equation of the node T1 (equation no. 1 and 5 of system (1)).<br>
4.	Integration of the equation of the ice formation, (equation 3 and 7 of system (1)).<br>
5.	Integration of the equation of the node 7*2 .(equation 2, 5 and 6 of system (1)).<br>
The temperature T2 is the estimation of the evaporator temperature that is passed to the control algorithm to manage the defrost function. Figure 7 shows a block diagram description of the presented implementation. Figure 9 summarizes the main parameters used in the algorithm of the example, and their numerical values. Such values were experimentally identified during the design phase.<br>
Figure 8 shows an example of performances of the described algorithm applied to the above-mentioned appliance with and without humid load inside the cavity. The control algorithm enables the compressor start-up at each cycle, when the estimated evaporator temperature is higher than 4.5Â°C. It can be appreciated that the difference between the actual evaporator temperature and the estimated temperature at the compressor start-up is lower than 1Â°C. This is an evidence of<br><br>
an acceptable precision of the estimation algorithm in recognizing the end of defrost phase.<br>
Of course the above mentioned algorithm must be considered only as an example of a possible implementation of the present invention. As described above, different solutions based on alternative techniques, referable to the generic block scheme of figure 3, can be used for the estimation (Kalman filters, neural fuzzy etc).<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
