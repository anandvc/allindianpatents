This invention refers to a process for the preparation of tetraazamacrocycles of general formula (I)<br><br>
wherein<br>
n, p and q can independently be 0 or 1, comprising the following steps of Scheme 1: Scheme 1<br><br>
wherein<br>
step a): condensation of polyamines of formula (III) with the glyoxal derivative of formula (IV), wherein Y is -OH (glyoxal hydrate) or [-SOg~<br><br>
Na+]  (Bertagnirii's  salt),  in water or  in water-soluble solvents or mixture thereof, at 0-50°C,  in  the  presence  of  stoichiometric amounts or of a slight excess of calcium hydroxide, to give the compound of formula (V); step b):  condensation of the compound of formula (V) with an alkylating agent X-CH2-(CH2)_-CH2-X, wherein q is as previously defined and X is a halogen   or   a   sulfonic   acid   reactive derivative,   in  at   least   stoichiometric amounts, in the presence of at least 2 moles of a base selected from alkali or alkaline-earth metal carbonates per mol of compound (V), at 25-150°C,  to give the compound of formula (II); step c):  oxidation of the compound of formula (II) with an oxidizing agent, in water or in a diphasic system constituted by water and an organic solvent, resistant to oxidation, at 0-100°C, to give a mixture of oxidized products which is submitted to step d):  hydrolysis in acid aqueous solution at a pH lower than 2 or in a basic aqueous solution at a pH higher than 12, at 110-200°C, to give the compound of formula (I). and,  in particular, the  process for  the preparation of  1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane  (known  as Cyclen) of formula (VIII),  where in  the compound of formula (I) n, p and q are 0, according to the steps of Scheme 2.<br><br><br>
1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane is the precursor for the synthesis of macrocyclic chelating agents for metal ions, since these chelating agents form stable complexes with such ions.<br>
In particular the complexes with paramagnetic metal ions, especially gadolinium ion, of such chelates are useful in the medical diagnostic field through Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), otherwise troublesome due to the high toxicity of the free ion. Presently two contrast media are available on the market, Dotarem(R) and Prohance(R), two gadolinium complexes whose chemical structure is based on Cyclen, while others are still under investigation.<br>
Therefore it is important to work out a synthetic method relying on this "building block", which is cost-effective even from an industrial point of view.<br>
The process of this invention uses as raw materials linear polyamines, glyoxal, alkyl dihalides, which are generally economical, and a suitable oxidizing agent.<br><br>
Therefore, the synthetic process is at the same time advantageous from an economic and environmental point of view, since it does not require the preparation of amines tosylderivatives, commonly used in the traditional synthesis of Richman-Atkins (see J. Am. Chem, Soc, 96, 2268, 1974).<br>
The key intermediate of the new process is the tetracyclic derivative of general formula (II):<br><br>
where n, p and q are as previously defined, and the two hydrogen atoms bound to the carbon atoms of the bridge can generate cis or trans configurations, according to the size of the tetracyclic derivative.<br>
Particularly useful is the intermediate of formula (VII) for the preparation of 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane.<br>
Such products have been already described in literature. For instance in G.R. Weisman, S.C.H. Ho, V. Johnson, Tetrahedron Lett., 1980, 21, 335, the synthesis of the following tetracycles (see Table 1), has been described without mentioning their use, but with the aim of studying the stereochemistry of the central bond.<br><br><br>
In addition the bibliographic references cite other syntheses starting from polyazamacrocycles and glyoxal, in aqueous solution or in dipolar aprotic solvents, such as acetonitrile, see for instance the following publications:<br>
W. Choinski, R.A. Kolinski, Polysh.    Pat.    101075,<br>
Chemical Abstracts. 1980, 92, 94444x;<br>
R.A. Kolinski, F.G. Riddel, Tetrahedron Lett. 1981,<br>
22, 2217.<br><br>
A principal characteristic of the compounds of formula (II), also cited in the above works, is the extraordinary stability under basic or acid hydrolytic conditions and with respect to reducing agents, differing from non-cyclic aminals. This stability excluded, up to now, the possibility of using the above tetracycles as direct precursors of polyazamacrocycles, and in some references the use of the same tetraazamacrocycle of formula (I) is required as raw material (G.R. Weisman, S.C.H. Ho, V. Johnson, Tetrahedron Lett., 1980, 21, 335).<br>
More recently, W096/28432 describes a synthetic process for compound (VII), according to the following reaction scheme:<br><br>
The structure of the intermediate of formula (IX) is different from the intermediate of formula (VI), whose synthesis has been previously illustrated and is part of this invention (cfr. Example IB experimental section). In fact it has a structure constituted by three cycles 5,6,5 (the numbers stand for the number of atoms constituting the ring of the tricyclic system).<br>
As a matter of fact, the synthetic conditions of the compound of formula (IX) described in W096/28432 do not correspond to those of the intermediate (VI) of this invention, which require the use of calcium hydroxide.<br><br>
WO 96/28432 also states that the intermediate (VII) can be converted into 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane (VIII) through acid hydrolysis, for instance with hydrobromic acid, or through heating with hydroxylamine in ethanol.<br>
The hydrolytic treatment with hydrobromic acid, disclosed in the experimental section of WO 96/28432, appears in conflict with the teaching of literature, which indicate the unexpected stability of (II) in acid aqueous solutions (cfr. Weisman, Tetr. Lett., 1980, 21, 335).<br>
The reaction with hydroxylamine in ethanol, according to WO 96/28432, requires the use of strong excesses of hydroxylamine as free base. These conditions, implementable on a laboratory scale, are not suitable for an industrial process, due to hydroxylamine dangerousness, which requires extremely careful handling, use and discharge.<br>
Now, it has been surprisingly found that the compounds of formula (II), which underwent oxidation with a suitable oxidizing agent, give a mixture of products which, despite of the starting compound, are convertible into tetraazamacrocycle of formula (I) through a simple hydrolysis.<br>
These conditions are extremely advantageous even on an industrial scale, since they can exploit ecological, economical and low-risk processes.<br>
Therefore this invention refers to a new process for the preparation of tetraazamacrocycles of general formula (I)<br><br><br>
wherein<br>
step a): condensation of polyamines of formula (III) with the glyoxal derivative of formula (IV), wherein Y is -OH (glyoxal hydrate) or [-S03~ Na+] (Bertagnini's salt), in water or in water-soluble solvents or mixture thereof, at 0-50°C, in the presence of stoichiometric amounts or of a slight excess of calcium hydroxide, to give the compound of formula (V);<br><br>
step b): condensation of the compound of formula (V) with an alkylating agent X-CH2-(CH2)q-CH2-X, wherein q is as previously defined and X is a halogen or a sulfonic acid reactive derivative, in at least stoichiometric amounts, in the presence of at least 2 moles of a base selected from alkali or alkaline-earth metal carbonates per mol of compound (V), at 25-150°C, to give the compound of formula (II);<br>
step c): oxidation of the compound of formula (II) with an oxidizing agent, in water or in a diphasic system constituted by water and an organic solvent, resistant to oxidation, at 0-100'C, to give a mixture of oxidized products which is submitted to<br>
step d):  hydrolysis in acid aqueous solution at a pH<br>
lower than 2 or in a basic aqueous solution at<br>
a pH higher than 12, at 110-200°C, to give the<br>
compound of formula (I).<br>
Preferred is the process of this invention for the<br>
preparation of:<br>
1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclotridecane, where in the compound<br>
of formula (I) n is 1 p and q are both 0;<br>
1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane, where in the compound<br>
of formula (I) n is 0, p is 1 and q is 0;<br>
1,4,8,12-tetraazacyclopentadecane, where in the compound<br>
of formula (I) n is 1 p is 1 and q is 0.<br>
Particularly preferred is the process of this invention<br>
for the preparation of  1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane<br>
(known as Cyclen)  of formula (VIII),  where  in the<br><br>
compound of formula (I) n, p and q are equal to 0, according to the following scheme through the preparation of intermediate 3H,6H-2a/5,6,8a-octahydro-tetraazacenaphthylene of formula (VI) starting from triethylentetraamine (TETA; corresponding to the compound of formula (III) when n=p=0) and the following preparation of intermediate 2a,4a,6a,8a-decahydro-tetraazacyclopent[fgjacenaphthylene of formula (VII). Scheme 2<br><br>
This invention also refers to a synthetic process useful for the preparation of tetracyclic compounds of formula (II), comprising only steps a) and b) of Scheme 1, according to the following Scheme 3:<br><br><br>
Preferred is the process for the preparation of compounds selected from the group constituted by: 2a,4a, 6a,8a-decahydro-<br>
tetraazacyclopent[fg]acenaphthylene, where n, p and q are 0 in the compound of formula (II); 7H-2a,4a,6a,9a-decahydro-tetraazacyclohept[jkl]-as-indscene, where n is 1, p and q are both 0 in the compound of formula (II);<br>
111,611-33,53,83,lOa-decahydro-tetraazapyrene, wherein is 0, p is 1 and q is 0 in the compound of formula (II); 1H,6H,9H-3a,5a,8a,lla-decahydro-<br>
tetraazscycloheptsCdef]phenantrene, where n is 1, p is 1 and q is 0 in the compound of formula (II).<br>
Particularly  preferred  is  the  synthesis  of 2a,4a,63,83-dec3hydro-tetr3azacyclopent[fg] acenaphthylene useful for the synthesis of 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane.<br>
Another aspect of this invention is an alternative synthesis of the compounds of formula (II), when n is<br><br>
equal to q,  to  give the compounds of formula  (X), starting-from linear diamines of formula (XI) where n is not present, as in Scheme 4: Scheme 4<br><br>
comprising steps a) and b), as from Scheme 1, with a difference in the amounts of reactives which are added as indicated in Scheme 4 or in slight excess.<br>
As far as step b) is concerned, according to the process of Scheme 1 and 4, and in the case q is 0, the solvent can be even 1,2-dichloroethane (also acting as reactive).<br>
The alkylating agent in step b), as previously said, is a dihalide or a diol, in which the hydroxy groups have been derivatized as reactive esters of sulfonic acid (for instance tosylates, mesylates, nosylates).<br>
The alkylating agent is dosed in amounts of at least 1 mol per mol of intermediate of formula (V), or at least 2 moles per mol of intermediate of formula (XII).<br>
The reaction is carried out in the presence of an<br><br>
inorganic base, preferably an alkali metal carbonate, dosed in amounts of at least 2 moles per mol of alkylating agent.<br>
The temperature, according to the solvent and the alkylating agent, can range between 25 and 150°C, preferably 50-80"C. Reaction time is 1-48 h.<br>
When the cyclization ends, the suspension is cooled and the insoluble salts are filtered.<br>
The filtrate is concentrated to a residue and the compound of formula (II) or the analogous compound of formula (X) is extracted by using an apolar solvent (as hexane or toluene). The product is concentrated to a solid residue to give the compounds of formula (II) for Scheme 1 or formula (X) for Scheme 4.<br>
For the oxidation of compounds of formula (II) and (X), according to step c) of Scheme 1, the usual oxidizing agent cited in literature can be used for the oxidation of aliphatic amines (J. March, Advanced Organic Chemistry, Wiley-Interscience), such as:<br>
derivatives of transition metals with a high level<br>
of oxidation, such as potassium permanganate;<br>
derivatives of halogens with positive oxidation<br>
state, such as sodium hypochlorite;<br>
halogens, such as bromine and chlorine;<br>
peroxides, such as hydrogen peroxide;<br>
peracid salts, such as sodium persulfate;<br>
oxygen:  in acid solution and in particular  in<br>
concentrated sulfuric acid solution.<br>
Other possibilities are the use of metal salts, such as iron trichloride, combined with oxygen.<br>
In  addition  to  the  usual  oxidizing  agents,<br><br>
Scheme 5<br><br>
(VII)<br>
In particular, during the oxidations of compound (VII) with bromine in slightly acidic solution, the dihydroxylate derivative is converted into a product with a dicationic structure of formula (XIII), which is isolated as perchlorate salt of formula (XIV), nearly water-insoluble, through addition of perchlorate ions to the solution of oxidation (see Experimental Section):<br><br>
Other salts can be prepared from compound of formula (XIV) through ion exchange processes: for instance, through elution of an aqueous solution of compound (XIV) on a column of an anion-exchange resin (Cl~ form), for example Amberlite 4200, a solution is obtained containing compound (XV) which can be isolated<br><br>
from isopropanol.<br><br>
In the first oxidative step, 4 electrons play a definitive role, while the number of electrons which takes part into other oxidation process is unknown.<br>
For a complete oxidation of the tetracycle intermediate, the amount of oxidizing agent should grant the extraction of at least 4 electrons, plus a possible excess, which can be determined experimentally. Since the aim of the reaction is not the completion of tetracycle oxidation, but the highest production of the effective tetraazamacrocyle precursors, it is necessary, in some case, to stop the oxidation before the total tetracycle disappearance.<br>
Table 2 illustrates some examples of oxidation of 2a,4a,6a,8a-decahydro-tetraazacyclopent[fg]acenaphthyle-ne to give 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane. Table 2 - Preparation of 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane through oxidation of 2a,4a,6a,8a-decahydro-tetraazacy-clopent[fg]acenaphthylene in aqueous solution<br><br>

The last two columns from right show the tetracycle oxidation percentage and the final yield in 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane, isolated after hydrolysis of the mixture resulting from the final oxidation (insoluble inorganic compounds, such as manganese dioxide, are removed by filtration).<br>
In case of oxidation carried out under neutral or slightly basic conditions, the hydrolysis is carried out in a highly basic aqueous solution (pH &gt; 12), at a temperature ranging from 110 to 200"C, and during 3 and 24 h.<br>
The isolation of 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane is carried out through crystallization of the same from the suitably concentrated hydrolyzed solution.<br>
In case of oxidation carried out in acid solution, in alternative to the conditions of basic hydrolysis, acid hydrolysis can be performed, operating for instance for 5-48 h in sulfuric acid-water, at 100-150°C.<br>
When the acid hydrolysis is complete, the solution is alkalinized, and after concentration, 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane is isolated through crystalliza-<br><br>
tion. The product can be recrystallized from water, toluene or ethyl acetate.<br>
Particularly preferred is the preparation of 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane, according to the previously cited Scheme 2, using bromine, as oxidizing agent in step c), in aqueous solution at a pH of 4-6, preferably 4.5, in a ratio of 2.0-3.0 moles per mol of compound (VII), preferably 2.5 and at a temperature of 17-30'C.<br>
As various changes could be made in the above compositions and methods without departing from the scope of the invention, it is intended that all matter contained in the above examples shall be interpreted as illustrative and not in a limiting sense.<br>

To a solution of triethylenetetraamine hydrate (100 g, 0.54 mol) in water (1 L) 80 g (1.08 mol) of calcium hydroxide are added. The suspension is cooled to 5°C,<br><br>
then a 5%-glyoxal aqueous solution (626 g, 0.54 mol) is added under stirring. After 2 h the reaction is complete (no triethylenetetraamine, GC analysis). The solution is taken to 20°C, the insoluble inorganic solid is filtered and washed with water. The filtrate is concentrated in a rotating evaporator under vacuum to give 100 g of the desired intermediate as colorless oily liquid. (GC purity: &gt;75%)<br>
