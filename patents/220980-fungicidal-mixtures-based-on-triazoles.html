It is an object of the present invention to provide mixtures which have an improved activity against harmful fungi combined with a reduced total amount of active compounds applied (synergistic mixtures), with a view to reducing the application rates and improving the activity spectrum of the known compounds I to XVI.<br>
We have found that this object is achieved by the mixture, defined at the outset, of prothioconazole with at least one further triazole. Moreover, we have found that applying the compound I and at least one of the compounds II to XVI simultaneously, i.e. together or separately, or applying the compound I and at least one of the compounds I to XVI in succession provides better control of harmful fungi than is possible with the individual compounds alone.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
is described in EP-A-0 378 953.<br>
Owing to the basic character of their nitrogen atoms, the compounds I to XVI are capable of forming salts or adducts with inorganic or organic acids or with metal ions.<br>
Examples of inorganic acids are hydrohalic acids, such as hydrogen fluoride, hydrogen chloride, hydrogen bromide and hydrogen iodide, carbonic acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid and nitric acid.<br>
Suitable organic acids are, for example, formic acid, and alkanoic acids, such as acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, trichloroacetic acid and propionic acid, and also glycolic acid, thiocyanuric acid, lactic acid, succinic acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, oxalic acid, alkylsulfonic acid (sulfonic acids having straight-chain or branched alkyl radicals of 1 to 20 carbon atoms), arylsulfonic acids or -disulfonic acids (aromatic radicals, such as phenyl or naphthyl, which carry one or two sulfonic acid groups), alkylphosphonic acids (phosphonic acids having straight-chain or branched alkyl radicals of 1 to 20 carbon atoms), arylphosphonic acids or -diphosphonic acids (aromatic radicals, such as phenyl and naphthyl, which carry one or two phosphonic acid radicals), where the alkyl or aryl radicals may carry further substituents, for example p-toluenesulfonic acid, salicylic acid, p-aminosalicylic acid, 2-phenoxybenzoic acid, 2-acetoxybenzoic acid, etc.<br>
Suitable metal ions are in particular the ions of the elements of the second main group, in particular calcium and magnesium, of the third and fourth main group, in particular aluminum, tin and lead, and also of the first to eighth transition group, in particular chromium, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc and others. Particular preference is given to the metal ions of the elements of the transition groups of the fourth period.<br><br>
The metals can be present in the various valences that they can<br>
assume<br>
Preference is given to mixtures of prothioconazole with epoxiconazole.<br>
Furthermore, preference is also given to mixtures of prothioconazole with metconazole.<br>

Preference is furthermore given to mixtures of prothioconazole with simeconazole.<br>
Preference is furthermore given to mixtures of prothioconazole with ipconazole.<br><br>
Preference is furthermore given to mixtures of prothioconazole with triticonazole.<br>
Preference is also given to ternary mixtures of prothioconazole with two other of the triazoles described above.<br>
When preparing the mixtures, it is preferred to employ the pure active compounds I to XVI, to which can be added further active compounds against harmful fungi or against other pests, such as insects, arachnids or nematodes, or else herbicidal or growth-regulating active compounds or fertilizers.<br>
The mixtures of the compound I and at least one of the compounds II to XVI or the compound I and at least one of the compounds II to XVI used simultaneously, jointly or separately, exhibit outstanding activity against a wide range of phytopathogenic fungi, in particular from the classes of the Ascomycetes, Basidiomycetes, Phycomycetes and Deuteromycetes. Some of them act systemically and can therefore also be employed as folio- and soil-acting fungicides.<br>
They are especially important for controlling a large number of fungi in a variety of crop plants, such as cotton, vegetable species (for example cucumbers, beans, tomatoes, potatoes and cucorbits), barley, grass, oats, bananas, coffee, corn, fruit species, rice, rye, soya, grapevine, wheat, ornamentals, sugarcane, and a variety of seeds.<br>
They are particularly suitable for controlling the following phytopathogenic fungi: Blumeria graminis (powdery mildew) in cereals, Erysiphe cichoracearum and Sphaerotheca fuliginea in cucorbits, Podosphaera leucotricha in apples, Uncinula necator in grapevines, Puccinia species in cereals, Rhizoctonia species in cotton, rice and lawns, Ustilago species in cereals and sugaxcane, Venturia inaequalis (scab) in apples, Helminthosporium species in cereals, Septoria nodorum in wheat, Botrytis cinera (gray mold) in strawberries, vegetables, ornamentals and grapevines, Cercospora arachidicola in groundnuts, Pseudocercosporella herpotrichoides in wheat and barley, Pyricularia oryzae in rice, Phytophthora infestans in potatoes and tomatoes, Plasmopara viticola in grapevines, Pseudoperonospora species in hops and cucumbers, Alternaria species in vegetables and fruit, Mycosphaerella species in bananas and also Fusarium and Verticillium species.<br><br>
They can furthermore be employed in the protection of materials (for example the protection of wood), for example against Paecilomyces variotii.<br>
The compound I and at least one of the compounds II to XVI can be applied simultaneously, that is either together or separately, or successively, the sequence, in the case of separate application, generally not having an effect on the result of the control measures.<br>

If phytopathogenic harmful fungi are to be controlled, the separate or joint application of the compound I and at least one of the compounds II to XVI or of the mixtures of the compound I and at least one of the compounds II to XVI is effected by spraying or dusting the seeds, the plants or the soils before or after sowing of the plants, or before or after plant emergence.<br>
The fungicidal synergistic mixtures according to the invention or the compound I and at least one of the compounds II to XVI can be formulated for example in the form of ready-to-spray solutions, powders and suspensions or in the form of highly concentrated aqueous, oily or other suspensions, dispersions, emulsions, oil dispersions, pastes, dusts, materials for broadcasting or granules, and applied by spraying, atomizing, dusting, broadcasting or watering. The use form depends on the intended purpose; in any case, it should ensure as fine and uniform as possible a distribution of the mixture according to the invention.<br>
The formulations are prepared in a known manner, e.g. by adding solvents and/or carriers. The formulations are usually admixed with inert additives, such as emulsifiers or dispersants.<br>
Suitable surfactants are the alkali metal salts, alkaline earth metal salts and ammonium salts of aromatic sulfonic acids, e.g. ligno-, phenol-, naphthalene- and dibutylnaphthalenesulfonic acid, and of fatty acids, alkyl- and alkylarylsulfonates, alkyl, lauryl ether and fatty alcohol sulfates, and salts of sulfated hexa-, hepta- and octadecanols, or of fatty alcohol glycol ethers, condensates of sulfonated naphthalene and its derivatives with formaldehyde, condensates of naphthalene or of the naphthalenesulfonic acids with phenol and formaldehyde, polyoxyethylene octylphenyl ether, ethoxylated isooctyl-, octyl-or nonylphenol, alkylphenol or tributylphenyl polyglycol ethers, alkylaryl polyether alcohols, isotridecyl alcohol, fatty<br><br>
alcohol/ethylene oxide condensates, ethoxylated castor oil, polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers or polyoxypropylene alkyl ethers, lauryl alcohol polyglycol ether acetate, sorbitol esters, lignosulfite waste liquors or methylcellulose.<br>
Powders, materials for broadcasting and dusts can be prepared by mixing or jointly grinding the compound I and at least one of the compounds II to XVI or the mixture of the compound I and at least one of the compounds II to XVI with a solid carrier.<br>
Granules (e.g. coated granules, impregnated granules or homogeneous granules) are usually prepared by binding the active compound, or active compounds, to a solid carrier.<br>
Fillers or solid carriers are, for example, mineral earths, such as silica gels, silicas, silicates, talc, kaolin, limestone, lime, chalk, bole, loess, clay, dolomite, diatomaceous earth, calcium sulfate, magnesium sulfate, magnesium oxide, ground synthetic materials and fertilizers, such as ammonium sulfate, ammonium phosphate, ammonium nitrate, ureas, and products of vegetable origin, such as cereal meal, tree bark meal, wood meal and nutshell meal, cellulose powders or other solid carriers.<br>
The formulations generally comprise from 0.1 to 95% by weight, preferably 0.5 to 90% by weight, of compound I and at least one of the compounds II to XVI or of the mixture of the compound I and at least one of the compounds II to XVI. The active compounds are employed in a purity of from 90% to 100%, preferably 95% to 100% (according to NMR spectrum or HPLC).<br>
The compounds I to XVI, the mixtures, or the corresponding formulations, are applied by treating the harmful fungi, their habitat, or the plants, seeds, soils, areas, materials or spaces to be kept free from them with a fungicidally effective amount of the mixture, or of the compound I and at least one of the compounds II to XVI in the case of separate application.<br>
Application can be effected before or after infection by the harmful fungi.<br>
Use example<br>
The synergistic activity of the mixtures according to the invention was demonstrated by the following experiments:<br>
The active compounds, separately or together, were formulated as a 10% emulsion in a mixture of 63% by weight of cyclohexanone and<br><br>
27% by weight of emulsifier, and diluted with water to the desired concentration.<br>
Evaluation was carried out by determining the infected leaf areas in percent. These percentages were converted into efficacies. The efficacy (W) was calculated as follows using Abbot's formula:<br><br>
a  corresponds to the fungal infection of the treated plants in<br>
% and   corresponds to the fungal infection of the untreated<br>
(control) plants in %<br>
An efficacy of 0 means that the infection level of the treated plants corresponds to that of the untreated control plants; an efficacy of 100 means that the treated plants were not infected.<br>
The expected efficacies of the mixtures of the active compounds were determined using Colby's formula [R.S. Colby, Weeds 15, 20-22 (1967)] and compared with the observed efficacies.<br><br>
E   expected efficacy, expressed in % of the untreated control,<br>
when using the mixture	of the active compounds A and B at the<br>
concentrations a and b<br>
x  efficacy, expressed in	% of the untreated control, when using<br>
active compound A at a	concentration of a<br>
y  efficacy, expressed in	% of the untreated control, when using<br>
active compound B at a	concentration of b.<br>
Use example 1: Activity against mildew of wheat caused by Erysiphe [syn. Blumeria]  graminis  forma specialis tritici<br>
Leaves of wheat seedlings of the cultivar "Kanzler" grown in pots were sprayed to run-off point with an aqueous suspension having the concentration of active compounds stated below. The suspension or emulsion was prepared from a stock solution made using 10% of active compound in a mixture comprising 70% of cyclohexanone, 20% of wetting agent and 10% of emulsifier. 24 hours after the spraycoating had dried on, the leaves dusted with spores of mildew of wheat (Erysiphe  [syn.  Blumeria]  graminis forma specialis tritici). The test plants were then placed in a greenhouse at 20-24°C and 60-90% relative atmospheric humidity.<br><br>
After 7 days, the extent of the development of the mildew was letermined visually in % infection of the entire leaf area.<br>
?he visually determined values for the percentage of diseased eaf area were converted into efficacies in % of the untreated Control. An efficacy of 0 means the same disease level as in the mtreated control, an efficacy of 100 means a disease level of  The expected efficacies for the active compound combinations Vere determined using Colby's formula mentioned above and rompared with the observed efficacies.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
