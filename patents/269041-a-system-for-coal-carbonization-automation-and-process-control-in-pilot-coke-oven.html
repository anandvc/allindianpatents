				<td>FIFLD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention rebates to pilot coke oven and, in particular, to a system for coal<br>
carbonization automation and process control in pilot coke oven directed to achieve<br>
uniform carbonization conditions all through the oven through out the coking process<br>
and facilitate monitoring of the pressure and temperature during the carbonization<br>
process for effective completion of carbonization. Also the system is adapted to generate<br>
continuously monitored data on amperage, voltage and resistance values of all six zones<br>
of the oven through out the carbonization period to facilitate failure analysis and taking<br>
advance corrective measures. The system is user friendly and is directed to facilitate<br>
reliable carbonization by way of better optimization of carbonization blend and process<br>
conditions.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
It is well known that pilot coke oven is used worldwide for characterization of coal and<br>
coke and evaluation of new coals for coke making. The paste objective of pilot coke oven<br>
test for coal carbonization is for blend optimization as well as comparing the quality of<br>
coke with respect to blast furnace operation and productivity.<br>
Carbonization of coal is a unique process where the heating control placed a pivotal role<br>
in coke making. The heat transfer takes place from both side walls through conduction,<br>
convection and mainly radiation at high temperatures. The principle of heating is visually<br>
based on master-slave PID control. However, in this way the heating at various zones<br>
(A1-A2, B1-B2, C1-C2) can not uniform because of door leakage and other parameters<br>
resulting in non-uniform heating affecting the coke quality.<br>
Carbonization process should take place in absence of air and with a positive pressure in<br>
the furnace to Use extent of 10-15 mm. of water column. It is normally difficult to<br>
maintain the same pressure inside the furnace during the eighteen hours operation for<br>
carbonization process. Carbonization process in any furnace can not be uniform as the<br>
coal charge is heated from both the side walls. The heat is transferred from both the<br>
walls to the center of the oven and the carbonization is supposed to be completed when<br>
the Center coke mass reaches approximately 1000oC.<br>
In some countries, however, the center coke temperature is taken between 970° to<br>
990°C as per the prevailing practices. The corresponding coking time depending on the<br>
heating rate can vary between 16 to 20 hours. Thus it is impossible to achieve the same<br>
2<br><br>
coking time for all the coal and coal blend carbonization with the same center coke mass<br>
temperature. Practical experience with the 300kg. pilot coke oven reveals that the<br>
center cote mass temperature varies more than 50°C under the same coking time. This<br>
in turn reflects towards the quality of coke vis-a-vis coke characterization. The<br>
comparison of coke produced from the pilot coke oven will not be correct. Therefore, it<br>
is necessary to introduce process control of coal carbonization with the help of<br>
automation.<br>
Carbonization failure analysis of the heating system and other control parameters are<br>
also not available worldwide for the testing of coal for carbonization. Because of this, the<br>
furnace shut down is frequent resulting in poor coke quality at the end of 16-18 hours of<br>
coking time.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>

The details of the invention, its objects and advantages are explained hereunder in<br>
greater details in relation to non limiting exemplary embodiments as per the following<br>
accompanying figures:<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING FIGURES<br>
Figure 1 : a schematic diagram of a Pilot Oven;<br>
Figure 2 : is an illustration of the temperature distribution across the oven;<br>
Figure 3 : PLC system configuration in accordance with the invention.<br>
Reference is invited to accompanying Figures 1 to 3 wherein in Figure 1 a Pilot Oven is<br>
shown schematically while figure 2 shows the temperature distribution across the oven.<br>
In accordance with me system as illustrated in relation to me figure 3, all the heating<br>
zones (six) are independently controlled. It is possible to achieve uniform heating<br>
control, proceeding from both the wall sides of the oven towards the center. Historical<br>
friend, heating and carbonization trend can also be recorded continuously. Pressure<br>
transducers attached to the moveable wall and LVDT (Unear Variable Differential<br>
Transducer) and pressure transducer from oven top and oven wall is connected to the<br>
PLC base system to monitor vertical shrinkage and wall pressure during coat<br>
carbonization respectively. All the temperature zones of the oven, center coke mass, wall<br>
and auxiliary temperature are monitored simultaneously during carbonization process.<br>
The current and voltage for me beating of all six zones of the furnace measured<br>
continuously using current and voltage transducers. It is observed that the uniform<br>
heating from all the throe zones of both walls require the balancing of resistance of the<br>
heating elements in each zone having 12 elements. Out of 12 elements in each zone,<br>
two are in series and in each now, while six of them are connected in parallel from both<br>
the ends of the elements. This has been developed to ensure minimum heat loss during<br>
failure of any elements in a section. Taking the above configuration into consideration,<br>
six numbers of current transducers were added for data logging of the current from six<br>
zones, separately. At this stage two options have been considered. In Option 1, digital<br>
8<br><br>
inputs for the PLC considering current operated relays to be used for sensing heater<br>
current for a group of heating elements, If the current drawn is at 3 defined level.<br>
As the current falls down below the defined level, the corresponding relay gets closed<br>
and the PLC will annunciate a problem with that group, In Option 2, analog inputs from<br>
the current transducers are provided for 3 group of twelve hearing elements. If the<br>
current drawn by a group of heaters is less than the current drawn by the other two<br>
groups by a defined margin PLC will annunciate a fault with the concerned group. This<br>
arrangement is adapted to reliably sensed a failure even if the current drawn varies over<br>
a wide range. Additionally, six numbers of voltage transducers are added to A1-A2, B1-<br>
62 and C1-C2 zones. This is done with a view to know the zone resistances of the oven<br>
during carbonization for uniform heating. In case of higher zone resistance more than<br>
the specified one as per theoretical calculation, the individual heating element with<br>
higher resistance value can be altered during oven stand by condition. In this way, the<br>
life of silicon carbide elements can also be enhanced by replacement of elements with<br>
the stipulated resistance value.<br>
Oven pressure and the center coke mass pressure can be monitored using a special<br>
device connected to pressure transmitter. The output of the transmitter is connected to<br>
the PLC system for continuous data logging. Under this stage of development of the<br>
automation of pilot coke oven, the rate of exhaust gases of the oven is monitored during<br>
carbonization which varies with time and type of coal and cost blends used. The<br>
volumetric flow through the orifice of the exhaust pipe creates the positive pressure<br>
inside the furnace by natural draft Earlier, the pressure of the oven was controlled by<br>
varying the diameter of the orifice manually. The orifice is not an appropriate method to<br>
control the oven pressure at a constant level. The suitable pressure transmitter in<br>
conjunction with a step motor or proportional motor connected to butterfly valve in the<br>
exhaust orifice of the pipe is introduced. This has been done with an aim to control the<br>
pressure of the furnace accurately and keep the furnace pressure at about 10mm. water<br>
column for the entire carbonization period irrespective of amount of gas flow and the<br>
constant natural draft on which the carbonization process has no control.<br>
The most Important part of the process automation for coal carbonization is heating<br>
control which is achieved preferably using 72 numbers DS type silicon carbide heating<br>
element, out of which 36 etements on each of the wall for heating. Initially, for heating<br>
the oven from ambient temperature, 90V is applied through transformer tapping for slow<br>
tosting. It is found that after 650°C of the oven temperature 90V is inadequate and<br>
9<br><br>
100V was given for raising the temperature from 650°C onwards upto 850°C. Crushed<br>
coal / coal blend is charged from the top or the oven at 850°C<br>
Carbonization of coal is an endothermic process and therefore requires heat Input and<br>
accordingly the voltage is raised to 110V for carbonization. After a spell of time when the<br>
moisture and volatile of coke start evolving, coke start forming. The property of coal<br>
usually varies from one coal / coal blend to the other with respect to the heat transfer<br>
phenomenon. The conductivity and specific heat of the coal, semi coke and coke mass<br>
also varies appreciably, which result in different, end coke temperature after fixing<br>
coking time. This problem is addressed by fixing power relays connected to input and<br>
output of the transformer tapping, which is triggered based on the temperature profile<br>
and programming for the heating control of the coal carbonization through PLC. In this<br>
way, irrespective of any coal blend end coke temperature say 1000oC can be achieved in<br>
the stipulated coking time of 16-18 hours. This ensures the uniform carbonization of all<br>
the coal blends under the same heating control to produce coke.<br>
In addition, a dial up modem is installed at one of the PCs to report message / fault to<br>
any telephone line in case of system failure already envisaged by the PLC<br>
It is thus possible by say of above disclosed system to achieve uniform heating control<br>
for the entire carbonization period through PLC. Also historical trend for all the<br>
carbonization process parameters can be obtained. Uniform pressure during<br>
carbonization, center coke mass pressure monitoring, uniform carbonization trend for<br>
better comparison of coke for blast furnace, fault finding in-built system, optimization of<br>
cold blend for carbonization, reliable comparison of coke qualities obtained from different<br>
blends carbonized under same condition are made possible by the present invention.<br>
