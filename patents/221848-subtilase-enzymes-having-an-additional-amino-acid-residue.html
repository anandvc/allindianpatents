				<td>Title:  Subti^arse enzymes of^-fcffe I-Sl and IrSl sub-grouns^liaving an additional amino ac&gt;a residue in anactive site-loop region.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
;        This invention relates to novel subtilase enzymes of the I-Sl and I-S2 sub-groups having at least one additional amino acid residue in position 103 of the active site loop (b) region from position 95 to 103. These proteases are useful exhibiting excellent or improved wash performance when used in detergents;<br>
i cleaning and detergent compositions. The invention further relates to genes coding for the expression of said enzymes when inserted into a suitable host cell or organism; and such host cells transformed therewith and capable of expressing said enzyme variants, and methods for producing the novel enzymes.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the detergent industry enzymes have for more than 3 0 years been implemented in washing formulations. Enzymes used in ""such formulations comprise proteases, lipases, amylases, cellulases, as well as other enzymes, or mixtures thereof. Commercially most important enzymes are proteases.<br>
An increasing number of commercially used proteases are protein engineered variants of naturally occurring wild type proteases, e.g. DURAZYM* (Novo Nordisk A/S), RELASE* (Novo Nordisk A/S), MAXAPEM8 (Gist-Brocades N.V.), PURAFECT* (Genencor International, Inc.).<br>
Further a number of protease variants are described in the art, such as in EP 130756 (GENENTECH)(corresponding to US Reissue Patent No. 34,606 (GENENCOR));  EP 214435 (HENKEL); WO 87/04461 (AMGEN); WO 87/05050 (GENEX); EP 260105 (GENENCOR); Thomas, Russell, and Fersht (1985) Nature 318 375-376; Thomas,<br><br>
Russell, and Fersht (1987) J.   Mol.   Biol.   193 803-813; Russel and Fersht Nature  328 496-500 (1987); WO 88/08028   (Genex); WO 88/08033 (Amgen) ; WO 95/2704.9 (SOLVAY S.A.); WO 95/30011 (PROCTER St   GAMBLE COMPANY) ; WO 95/3 0010 (PROCTER &amp; GAMBLE i COMPANY); WO 95/29979 (PROCTER &amp; GAMBLE COMPANY); US 5.543.302 (SOLVAY S.A.); EP 251 446 (GENENCOR) ; WO 89/06279 (NOVO NORDISK A/S) ; WO 91/00345 (NOVO NORDISK A/S) ; EP 525 610 Al (SOLVAY); and WO 94/02618 (GIST-BROCADES N.V.).<br>
However, even though a number of useful protease variants have been described, there is still a need for new improved proteases or protease variants for a number of industrial uses.<br>
Therefore, an object of the present invention, is to provide improved proteases or protein engineered protease variants, especially for use in the detergent industry.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present inventors have found that subtilisins wherein at least one of the active site loops are longer than those presently known, exhibit improved wash performance properties in detergent compositions. The identification thereof was done in constructing subtilisin variants, especially of the subtilisin 3 09 (BLSAVI or Savinase®) , exhibiting improved wash performance properties in detergent compositions relative to the parent wild type enzyme. This has been described in our earlier application DK1332/97.<br>
It has now been found that certain subtilases or variants thereof of the I-SI (true "subtilisins" ) and I-S2 (high alkaline subtilisins) sub-groups having at least one additional amino acid residue in position 103 (or rather between positions 103 and 104) of the active site loop (b) region from position 95 to 103, exhibit surprisingly improved wash performance in<br><br>
comparison to those presently known and those described in said application.<br>
The improved proteases according to the invention may be obtained by isolation from natural resources or by the introduction of at least one further amino acid residue (an insertion) in the active site loop (b) between positions 103 and 104 in a wild type subtilase (for a definition of the active site loops and the numbering of positions see below).<br>
Although this finding was done in subtilisin 3 09 it is predicted that it will be possible to produce or isolate similar advantageous subtilases or subtilase variants.<br>
Furthermore it will be possible to specifically screen natural isolates to identify novel wild type subtilases comprising an active site loop (b) which is longer than the corresponding active site loop in known wild type subtilases, such as subtilisin 3 09, which subtilases can be considered to have an inserted amino acid residue between positions 103 and 104, and exhibiting excellent wash performance in a detergent, in comparison to their closest related known subtilisin, such as subtilisin 309.<br>
Concerning alignment and numbering reference is made to Figs. 1, la, 2 and 2a below showing alignments between subtilisin BPN" (BASBPN) (a) and subtilisin 309 (BLSAVI) (b) , and alignments between subtilisin BPN" (a) (BASBPN) and subtilisin Carlsberg (g) . In Figs. 1 and 2 the alignments were established by the use of the GAP routine of the GCG package as indicated below, whereas the alignments of Figs, la and 2a are the same as shown in WO 91/00345. These alignments are in this patent application used as a reference for numbering the residues.<br>
The seven active site loops (a) to (g) (including both the end amino acid residues indicated) are here defined to ancompass the amino acid residues in the segments given below<br><br>
(a)	the region between amino acid residue 33 and 43;<br>
(b)	the region between amino acid residue 95 and 103;<br>
(c)	the region between amino acid residue 125 and 132;<br>
(d)	the region between amino acid residue 153 and 173;<br>
(e)	the region between amino acid residue 181 and 195;<br>
(f)	the region between amino acid residue 202 and 204;<br>
(g)	the region between amino acid residue 218 and 219.<br>
Accordingly, in a first aspect the invention relates to an isolated (i.e. greater than 10 % pure) subtilase enzymes of :he I-Sl and I-S2 sub-groups having at least one additional amino acid residue in position 103 of the active site loop (b) region from position 95 to 103, whereby said additional amino acid residue (s) correspond to the insertion of at least one amino acid residue between positions 103 and 104.<br>
In a second aspect the invention relates to an isolated DNA sequence encoding a subtilase variant of the invention.<br>
In a third aspect the invention relates to an expression sector comprising an isolated DNA sequence encoding a subtilase variant of the invention.<br>
In a fourth aspect the invention relates to a microbial host cell transformed with an expression vector according to the fourth aspect.<br>
In a further aspect the invention relates to the produc¬tion of the subtilisin enzymes of the invention.<br>
The enzymes of the invention can generally be produced by either cultivation of a microbial strain from which the enzyme was isolated and recovering the enzyme in substantially pure form; or by inserting an expression vector according to the fourth aspect of the invention into a suitable microbial host,<br><br>
cultivating the host to express the desired subtilase enzyme, and recovering the enzyme product.<br>
Further the invention relates to a composition comprising a subtilase or subtilase variant of the invention.<br>
Even further the invention relates to the use of the enzymes of the invention for a number of industrial relevant uses, in particular for use in cleaning compositions and cleaning compositions comprising the mutant enzymes, especially detergent compositions comprising the mutant subtilisin enzymes.<br>

NOMENCLATURE AND CONVENTIONS FOR DESIGNATION OF VARIANTS<br><br>
In describing the various enzyme variants produced or contemplated according to the invention, the following nomen¬clatures and conventions have been adapted for ease of reference:<br>
A frame of reference is first defined by aligning the isolated or parent wild type enzyme with subtilisin BPN" (BASBPN).<br>
The alignment can be obtained by the GAP routine of the GCG package version 9.1 to number the variants using the following parameters: gap creation penalty = 8 and gap extension penalty = 8 and all other parameters kept at their default values.<br>
Another method is to use known recognised alignments between subtilases, such as the alignment indicated in WO 91/00345. In most cases the differences will not be of any importance.<br>
Such alignments between subtilisin BPN" (BASBPN) and subtilisin 309 (BLSAVI) and subtilisin Carlsberg (BLSCAR), respectively are indicated in Figs. 1, la, 2, and 2a. By this a ID number of deletions and insertions will be defined in relation to BASBPN. In Fig. 1 subtilisin 309 has 6 deletions in positions 36, 58, 158, 162, 163, and 164 in comparison to BASBPN, whereas in Fig. la subtilisin 309 has the same deletions in positions 36, 56, 159, 164, 165, and 166 in comparison to BASBPN. In Fig. s 2 subtilisin Carlsberg has one deletion in position 58 in comparison to BASBPN, whereas in Fig. 2a subtilisin Carlsberg has the one deletion in position 56 in comparison to BASBPN. These deletions are in Figs. 1, la, 2, and 2a indicated by asterixes (*) .<br>
The various modifications performed in a wild type enzyme is indicated in general using three elements as follows:<br><br>
Original amino acid position substituted amino acid<br>
The notation G195E thus means a substitution of a glycine in position 195 with a glutamic acid.<br>
In the case when the original amino acid residue may be any amino acid residue, a short hand notation may at times be used indicating only the position and substituted amino acid,<br>
Position substituted amino acid<br>
Such a notation is particular relevant in connection with modification(s) in homologous subtilases {vide infra).<br>
Similarly when the identity of the substituting amino acid residue(s) is immaterial,<br>
Original amino acid position<br>
When both the original amino acid(s) and substituted amino acid(s) may comprise any amino acid, then only the position is indicated, e.g.:     170.<br>
When the original amino acid(s) and/or substituted amino acid(s) may comprise more than one, but not all amino acid(s),. then the selected amino acids are indicated inside brackets { },<br>
Original amino acid position (substituted amino acid-| , . . . , substituted amino acidn)<br>
For specific variants the specific three or one letter codes are used, including the codes Xaa and X to indicate any amino acid residue.<br>
SUBSTITUTIONS:<br><br>
The substitution of Glutamic acid for glycine in position 195 is designated as:<br>
Glyl95Glu   or   G195E or the substitution of any amino acid residue acid for glycine in position 195 is designated as:<br>
Glyl95Xaa   or  G195X or<br>
Glyl95      or  G195<br>
The substitution of serine for any amino acid residue in position 170 would thus be designated<br>
Xaal70Ser   or  X170S. or<br>
170Ser     or   170S<br>
Such a notation is particular relevant in connection with nodification(s) in homologous subtilases (vide infra).   170Ser is :hus meant to comprise e.g.   both a Lysl70Ser modification in 3ASBPN and Argl70Ser modification in BLSAVI (cf. Fig. 1).<br>
For a modification where the original amino acid(s) ind/or substituted amino acid(s) may comprise more than one, but lot all amino acid(s), the substitution of glycine, alanine, serine or threonine for arginine in position 170 would be .ndicated by<br>
Argl70{Gly,Ala,Ser,Thr}    or R170{G, A, S, T} to indicate the variants<br>
R170G, R170A, R170S, and R170T.<br>
DELETIONS:<br>
A deletion of glycine in position 195 will be indicated Dy:<br>
Glyl95*     or  G195*<br><br>
Correspondingly the deletion of more than one amino acid residue, such as the deletion of glycine and leucine in positions 195 and 196 will be designated<br>
Glyl95*+Leul96*  or   G195*+L196*<br>
INSERTIONS:<br>
The insertion of	an additional amino acid residue such as<br>
e.g.   a lysine after G195	is :<br>
Glyl95GlyLys	or  G195GK; or<br>
when more than one amino	acid residue is inserted, such as e.g.<br>
a Lys, Ala and Ser after	G195 this is :<br>
Glyl95GlyLysAlaSer    or  G195GKAS<br>
In such cases the inserted amino acid residue(s) are numbered by the addition of lower case letters to the position number of the amino acid residue preceding the inserted amino acid residue (s). In the above example the sequences 194 to 196 would thus be:<br>
194 195 196 BLSAVI      A - G - L<br>
194 195 195a 195b 195c 196 Variant    A-G-K-  A-  S-  L<br>
In cases where an amino acid residue identical to the existing amino acid residue is inserted it is clear that a degeneracy in the nomenclature arises. If for example a glycine is inserted after the glycine in the above example this would be indicated by G195GG. The same actual change could just as well i be indicated as A194AG for the change from 194 195 196 BLSAVI      A - G - L<br><br>
to<br>
194 195  195a 196 Variant    A - G -  G -  L<br>
194 194a 195  196<br>
Such instances will be apparent to the skilled person, and the indication G195GG and corresponding indications for this type of insertions are thus meant to comprise such equivalent degenerate indications.<br>
FILLING A GAP:<br>
Where a deletion in an enzyme exists in the reference comparison with the subtilisin BPN" sequence used for the numbering, an insertion in such a position is indicated as:<br>
*3 6Asp      or   *3 6D for the insertion of an aspartic acid in position 36<br>
MULTIPLE MODIFICATIONS<br>
Variants comprising multiple modifications are separated by pluses, e.g. :<br>
Argl70Tyr+Glyl95Glu   or   R170Y+G195E representing modifications in positions 170 and 195 substituting tyrosine and glutamic acid for arginine and glycine, respec¬tively.<br>
or e.g.   Tyrl67{Gly,Ala,Ser,Thr}+Argl70{Gly,Ala,Ser,Thr} designates the variants<br>
Tyrl67Gly+Argl70GIy, Tyrl67Gly+Argl70Ala, Tyrl67Gly+Argl70Ser, Tyrl67Gly+Argl70Thr, Tyrl67Ala+Argl70Gly, Tyrl67Ala+Argl70Ala, Tyrl67Ala+Argl70Ser, Tyrl67Ala+Argl70Thr, Tyrl67Ser+Argl70Gly, Tyrl67Ser+Argl70Ala, Tyrl67Ser+Argl70Ser,       Tyrl67Ser+Argl70Thr,<br><br>
Tyrl67Thr+Argl70Gly,       Tyrl67Thr+Argl70Ala, Tyrl67Thr+Argl70Ser,   and Tyrl67Thr+Argl70Thr. This nomenclature is particular relevant relating to modifications aimed at substituting, replacing, inserting or deleting amino acid residues having specific common properties, such as residues of positive charge (K, R, H), negative charge (D, E), or conservative amino acid modification (s) of e.g. Tyrl67{Gly,Ala,Ser,Thr}+Argl70{Gly,Ala,Ser,Thr} , which signifies substituting a small amino acid for another small amino acid. See section "Detailed description of the invention" for further details.<br>
Proteases<br>
Enzymes cleaving the amide linkages in protein substrates are classified as proteases, or (interchangeably) peptidases<br>
(see Walsh, 1979, Enzymatic Reaction Mechanisms.   W.H. Freeman and Company, San Francisco, Chapter 3).<br>
Numbering of amino acid positions/residues<br>
If nothing else is mentioned the amino acid numbering used herein correspond to that of the subtilase BPN" (BASBPN) sequence. For further description of the BPN" sequence see Figs. 1 and 2, or Siezen et al. , Protein Engng.   4 (1991) 719-737.<br>
Serine proteases<br>
A serine protease is an enzyme which catalyzes the hydrolysis of peptide bonds, and in which there is an essential serine residue at the active site (White, Handler and Smith, 1973 "Principles of Biochemistry, " Fifth Edition, McGraw-Hill Book Company, NY, pp. 271-272).<br>
The bacterial serine proteases have molecular weights in the 20,000 to 45,000 Dalton range. They are inhibited by<br><br>
diisopropylfluorophosphate. They hydrolyze simple terminal esters and are similar in activity to eukaryotic chymotrypsin, also a serine protease. A more narrow term, alkaline protease, covering a sub-group, reflects the high pH optimum of some of the serine proteases, from pH 9.0 to 11.0 (for review, see Priest (1977) Bacteriological     Rev.   41 711-753) .<br>
Subtilases<br>
A sub-group of the serine proteases tentatively designated subtilases has been proposed by Siezen et al. , Protein Engng.   4 (1991) 719-737 and Siezen et al. Protein Science  6   (1997) 501-523. They are defined by homology analysis of more than 170 amino acid sequences of serine proteases previously referred to as subtilisin-like proteases. A subtilisin was previously often defined as a serine protease produced by Gram-positive bacteria or fungi, and according to Siezen et al.   now is a subgroup of the subtilases. A wide variety of subtilases have been identified, and the amino acid sequence of a number of subtilases has been determined. For a more detailed description Df such subtilases and their amino acid sequences reference is nade to Siezen et al. (1997) .<br>
One subgroup of the subtilases, I-Sl or w true# subtilisins, comprises the "classical" subtilisins, such as subtilisin 168 (BSS168), subtilisin BPN1, subtilisin Carlsberg (ALCALASE\ NOVO NORDISK A/S) , and subtilisin DY (BSSDY) .<br>
A further subgroup of the subtilases, I-S2 or high alkaline subtilisins, is recognised by Siezen et al.    (supra). Sub-group I-S2 proteases are described as highly alkaline subtilisins and comprises enzymes such as subtilisin PB92 (BAALKP) (MAXACAL*, Gist-Brocades NV) , subtilisin 309 (SAVINASE*, NOVO NORDISK A/S) , subtilisin 147 (BLS147) (ESPERASE*, NOVO NORDISK A/S), and alkaline elastase YaB (BSEYAB).<br><br>

1 Parent subtilase<br>
The term "parent subtilase" describes a subtilase defined according to Siezen et al. (1991 and 1997) . For further<br><br>
details see description of ""SUBTILASES" immediately above. A parent subtilase may also be a subtilase isolated from a natural source, wherein subsequent modification have been made while retaining the characteristic of a subtilase. Alternatively the term ,% parent subtilase" may be termed 41wild type subtilase".<br>
Modification(s) of a subtilase variant<br>
The term ,4modif ication (s) " used herein is defined to include chemical modification of a subtilase as well as genetic manipulation of the DNA encoding a subtilase. The modification (s) can be replacement (s) of the amino acid side chain(s), substitution (s), deletion(s) and/or insertions in or at the amino acid(s) of interest.<br>

In the context of this invention, the term subtilase variant or mutated subtilase means a subtilase that has been produced by an organism which is expressing a mutant gene derived from a parent microorganism which possessed an original or parent gene and which produced a corresponding parent enzyme, the parent gene having been mutated in order to produce the mutant gene from which said mutated subtilase protease is produced when expressed in a suitable host.<br>
Homologous subtilase sequences<br>
Specific active site loop regions, and amino acid insertions in said loops of SAVINASE® subtilase are identified for modification herein to obtain a subtilase variant of the invention.<br>
However, the invention is not limited to modifications of this particular subtilase, but extend to other parent (wild-type) subtilases, which have a homologous primary structure to<br><br>
that of SAVINASE®. The homology between two amino acid sequences is in this context described by the parameter "identity".<br>
In order to determine the degree of identity between two subtilases the GAP routine of the GCG package version 9.1 can be applied (infra)   using the same settings. The output from the routine is besides the amino acid alignment the calculation of the "Percent Identity" between the two sequences.<br>
Based on this description it is routine for a person skilled in the art to identify suitable homologous subtilases and corresponding homologous active site loop regions, which can be modified according to the invention.<br>
Wash performance<br>
The ability of an enzyme to catalyze the degradation of various naturally occurring substrates present on the objects to be cleaned during e.g.   wash or hard surface cleaning is often referred to as its washing ability, wash-ability, detergency, or wash performance. Throughout this application the term wash performance will be used to encompass this property.<br>
Isolated DNA sequence<br>
The term "isolated", when applied to a DNA sequence Tiolecule, denotes that the DNA sequence has been removed from its natural genetic milieu and is thus free of other extraneous or  unwanted coding sequences, and is in a form suitable for use tfithin genetically engineered protein production systems. Such isolated molecules are those that are separated from their natural environment and include cDNA and genomic clones. Isolated DNA molecules of the present invention are free of other genes with which they are ordinarily associated, but may include naturally occurring 5" and 3 " untranslated regions such as promoters and terminators. The identification of associated<br><br>
regions will be evident to one of ordinary skill in the art (see for example, Dynan and Tijan, Nature 316:774-78, 1985) . The term uan isolated DNA sequence" may alternatively be termed "a cloned DNA sequence" .<br>
Isolated protein<br>
When applied to a protein, the term "isolated" indicates that the protein has been removed from its native environment.<br>
In a preferred form, the isolated protein is substantially free of other proteins, particularly other homologous proteins (i.e. "homologous impurities" (see below)).<br>
An isolated protein is greater than 10 % pure, preferably greater than 20 % pure, more preferably greater than 30 % pure, as determined by SDS-PAGE. Further it is preferred to provide the protein in a highly purified form, i.e., greater than 40% pure, greater than 60% pure, greater than 80% pure, more preferably greater than 95% pure, and even more preferably greater than 99% pure, as determined by SDS-PAGE.<br>
The term "isolated protein" may alternatively be termed "purified protein".<br>
Homologous impurities<br>
The term "homologous impurities" means any impurity (e.g. another polypeptide than the polypeptide of the invention) which originate from the homologous cell where the polypeptide of the invention is originally obtained from.<br>
Obtained from<br>
The term "obtained from" as used herein in connection with a specific microbial source, means that the polynucleotide and/or polypeptide produced by the specific source, or by a cell in which a gene from the source has been inserted.<br><br>
Substrate<br>
The term ""Substrate" used in connection with a substrate for a protease is should be interpreted in its broadest form as comprising a compound containing at least one peptide bond susceptible to hydrolysis by a subtilisin protease.<br>
Product<br>
The term "product" used in connection with a product derived from a protease enzymatic reaction should in the context of this invention be interpreted to include the products of a hydrolysis reaction involving a subtilase protease. A product may be the substrate in a subsequent hydrolysis reaction.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The subtilases of the invention in a first aspect relates to an isolated (i.e. greater than 10 % pure) subtilase enzyme of the I-SI and I-S2 sub-groups having at least one additional amino acid residue in position 103 of the active site loop (b)<br><br>
region from position 95 to 103, whereby said additional amino acid residue (s) correspond to the insertion of at least one amino acid residue between positions 103 and 104.<br>
In other words the subtilases of the invention are characterized by comprising an active site loop (b) region of more than 9 amino acid residue and wherein the additional amino acid residue is or can be considered as being inserted between positions 103 and 104 as compared to the parent or a known wild type subtilase.<br>
A subtilase of the first aspect of the invention may be a parent or wildtype subtilase identified and isolated from nature.<br>
Such a parent wildtype subtilase may be specifically screened for by standard techniques known in the art.<br>
One preferred way of doing this may be by specifically PCR amplify DNA regions known to encode active site loops in subtilases from numerous different microorganism, preferably different Bacillus strains.<br>
Subtilases are a group of conserved enzymes, in the sense that their DNA and amino acid sequences are homologous. Accordingly it is possible to construct relatively specific primers flanking active site loops.<br>
One way of doing this is by investigating an alignment of different subtilases (see e.g.   Siezen et al. Protein Science 6 (1997) 501-523). It is from this routine work for a person skilled in the art to construct PCR primers flanking the active site loop corresponding to""" the active site loop (b) between amino acid residue 95 to 103 in any of the group I-SI or I-S2 groups, such as from BLSAVI. Using such PCR primers to amplify DNA from a number of different microorganism, preferably different Bacillus strains, followed by DNA sequencing of said amplified PCR fragments, it will be possible to identify strains<br><br>
which produce subtilases of these groups comprising a longer, as compared to e.g.   BLSAVI, active site region corresponding to the active site loop region from positions 95 to 103, and where an insertion can be considered to exist between positions 103 and 104. Having identified the strain and a partial DNA sequence of such a subtilase of interest, it is routine work for a person skilled in the art to complete cloning, expression and purification of such a subtilase of the invention.<br>
However, it is envisaged that a subtilase enzyme of the invention predominantly is a variant of a parent subtilase.<br>
Accordingly, in one embodiment the invention relates to an isolated subtilase enzyme according to the first aspect of the invention, wherein said subtilase enzyme is a constructed variant having a longer active site loop (b) than its parent enzyme by having at least one amino acid insertion between amino acid residues 103 and 104.<br>
The subtilases of the invention exhibit excellent wash performance in a detergent, and if the enzyme is a constructed variant an improved wash performance in a detergent in comparison to its closest related subtilase, such as subtilisin 309.<br>
Different subtilase products will exhibit a different ... tfash performance in different types of detergent compositions. A subtilase of the invention has improved wash performance, as :ompared to its closest relative in a majority of such different :ypes of detergent compositions.<br>
Preferably a subtilase enzyme of the invention has .mproved wash performance, as compared to its closest relative .n the detergent composition shown in Example 3 herein (vide Infra) .<br>
In order to determine if a given subtilase amino acid :equence (irrelevant whether said subtilase sequence is a parent<br><br>
wildtype subtilase sequence or a subtilase variant sequence produced by any other method than by site directed mutagenesis) is within the scope of the invention, the following procedure may be used:<br>
i)   align said subtilase sequence to the amino acid sequence of subtilisin BPN" (see section " "Definitions" herein (vide supra); ii)  based on the alignment performed in step i) identify the active site loop (b), in said subtilase sequence corresponding to the active site loop (b) region of subtilisin BPN" comprising the region (both of the end amino acids included) between amino acid residue from 95 to 103; iii) determine if the active site loop (b) in said subtilase sequence, identified in step ii) is longer than the corresponding active site loop in BLSAVI and if said prolongation corresponds to the insertion of at least one amino acid residue between positions 103 and 104. If this is the case the subtilase investigated is a subtilase within the scope of the present invention.<br>
The alignment performed in step i) above is performed as described above by using the GAP routine.<br>
Based on this description it is routine for a person skilled in the art to identify the active site loop (b) in a subtilase and determine if the subtilase in question is within the scope of the invention. If a variant is constructed by site directed mutagenesis, it is of course known beforehand if the subtilase variant is within the scope of the invention.<br>
A subtilase variant of the invention may be constructed by standard techniques known in the art such as by site-directed/random mutagenesis or by DNA shuffling of different subtilase sequences. See section " PRODUCING A SUBTILASE<br><br>

Accordingly, an even further embodiment of the invention relates to a variant according to the invention, wherein said " modification is chosen from the group comprising:<br>
PRODUCING A SUBTILASE VARIANT<br>
Many methods for cloning a subtilase of the invention and<br>
for introducing insertions into genes (e.g.   subtilase genes) are<br>
well known in the art, cf. the references cited in the<br>
,xBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION" section.<br>
In general standard procedures for cloning of genes and introducing insertions (random and/or site directed) into said genes may be used in order to obtain a subtilase variant of the ; invention. For further description of suitable techniques refer¬ence is made to Examples herein (vide infra)   and (Sambrook et al. (1989) Molecular cloning: A laboratory manual, Cold Spring Harbor lab., Cold Spring Harbor, NY; Ausubel, F. M. et al.<br>
(eds.) "Current protocols in Molecular Biology". John Wiley and Sons, 1995; Harwood, C. R. , and Cutting, S. M. (eds.) "Molecular Biological Methods for Bacillus". John Wiley and Sons, 1990); and WO 96/34946.<br>
Further a subtilase variant of the invention may be constructed by standard techniques for artificial creation of diversity, such as by DNA shuffling of different subtilase genes (WO 95/22625; Stemmer WPC, Nature 370:389-91 (1994)). DNA shuffling of e.g. the gene encoding Savinase® with one or more partial subtilase sequences identified in nature to comprise an active site (b) loop regions longer than the active site (b) loop of Savinase®, will after subsequent screening for improved wash performance variants, provide subtilase variants according to the invention.<br><br>
EXPRESSION VECTORS<br>
A recombinant expression vector comprising a DNA construct encoding the enzyme of the invention may be any vector which may conveniently be subjected to recombinant DNA pro¬cedures .<br>
The choice of vector will often depend on the host cell into which it is to be introduced. Thus, the vector may be an autonomously replicating vector, i.e. a vector which exists as an extrachromosomal entity, the replication of which is indepen¬dent of chromosomal replication, e.g. a plasmid. Alternatively, the vector may be one that on introduction into a host cell is integrated into the host cell genome in part or in its entirety and replicated together with the chromosome (s) into which it has been integrated.<br>
The vector is preferably an expression vector in which the DNA sequence encoding the enzyme of the invention is operably linked to additional segments required for transcription of the DNA. In general, the expression vector is derived from plasmid or viral DNA, or may contain elements of Doth. The term, vvoperably linked" indicates that the segments are arranged so that they function in concert for their intended purposes, e.g. transcription initiates in a promoter and proceeds through the DNA sequence coding for the enzyme. The promoter may be any DNA sequence which shows transcriptional activity in the host cell of choice and may be derived from genes encoding proteins either homologous or heterologous to the host cell.<br>
Examples of suitable promoters for use in bacterial host cells include the promoter of the Bacillus stearothermophilus maltogenic amylase gene, the Bacillus  licheniformis  alpha-amylase gene, the Bacillus amyloliquefaciens  alpha-amylase gene,<br><br>
the Bacillus subtilis  alkaline protease gen, or the Bacillus<br>
pumilus  xylosidase gene, or the phage Lambda PR or PL promoters<br>
or the E. coli lac, trp or tac promoters.<br>
The DNA sequence encoding the enzyme of the invention may<br>
also, if necessary, be operably connected to a suitable<br>
terminator.<br>
The recombinant vector of the invention may further<br>
comprise a DNA sequence enabling the vector to replicate in the<br>
host cell in question.<br>
The vector may also comprise a selectable marker, e.g.   a gene the product of which complements a defect in the host cell, or a gene encoding resistance to e.g. antibiotics like kanamycin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, tetracycline, spectinomycine, or the like, or resistance to heavy metals or herbicides.<br>
To direct an enzyme of the present invention into the secretory pathway of the host cells, a secretory signal sequence<br>
(also known as a leader sequence, prepro sequence or pre sequence) may be provided in the recombinant vector. The secretory signal sequence is joined to the DNA sequence encoding the enzyme in the correct reading frame. Secretory signal sequences are commonly positioned 5" to the DNA sequence encoding the enzyme. The secretory signal sequence may be that normally associated with the enzyme or may be from a gene encoding another secreted protein.<br>
The procedures used to ligate the DNA sequences coding for the present enzyme, the promoter and optionally the termin¬ator and/or secretory signal sequence, respectively, or to assemble these sequences by suitable PCR amplification schemes, and to insert them into suitable vectors containing the information necessary for replication or integration, are well<br><br>
(<br>
known to persons skilled in the art (cf., for instance, Sambrook et al., op.cit.).<br>
HOST CELL<br>
The DNA sequence encoding the present enzyme introduced into the host cell may be either homologous or heterologous to the host in question. If homologous to the host cell, i.e. produced by the host cell in nature, it will typically be operably connected to another promoter sequence or, if applicable, another secretory signal sequence and/or terminator sequence than in its natural environment. The term "homologous" is intended to include a DNA sequence encoding an enzyme native to the host organism in question. The term "heterologous" is intended to include a DNA sequence not expressed by the host cell in nature. Thus, the DNA sequence may be from another organism, or it may be a synthetic sequence.<br>
The host cell into which the DNA construct or the recombinant vector of the invention is introduced may be any :ell which is capable of producing the present enzyme and includes bacteria, yeast, fungi and higher eukaryotic cells including plants.<br>
Examples of bacterial host cells which, on cultivation, are capable of producing the enzyme of the invention are gram-positive bacteria such as strains of Bacillus,   such as strains of B.   subtilis,   B.   licheniformis,   B.   lentus,   B.  brevis,   B. stearothermophilus,   B.   alkalophilus,   B.   amyloliquefaciens,   B. coagulans,   B.   circulans,   B.   lautus,   B.   megatherium  or B. thuringiensis, or strains of Streptomyces, such as S.   lividans or  S.   murinus,   or gram-negative bacteria such as Echerichia zoli.<br>
The transformation of the bacteria may be effected by protoplast transformation, electroporation, conjugation, or by<br><br>
using competent cells in a manner known per se (cf. Sambrook et al., supra).<br>
When expressing the enzyme in bacteria such as E.   coli, the enzyme may be retained in the cytoplasm, typically as insol¬uble granules (known as inclusion bodies), or may be directed to the periplasmic space by a bacterial secretion sequence. In the former case, the cells are lysed and the granules are recovered and denatured after which the enzyme is refolded by diluting the denaturing agent. In the latter case, the enzyme may be recovered from the periplasmic space by disrupting the cells, e.g. by sonication or osmotic shock, to release the contents of the periplasmic space and recovering the enzyme.<br>
When expressing the enzyme in gram-positive bacteria such as Bacillus or Streptomyces strains, the enzyme may be retained in the cytoplasm, or may be directed to the extracellular medium by a bacterial secretion sequence. In the latter case, the enzyme may be recovered from the medium as described below.<br>
METHOD OF PRODUCING SUBTILASE<br>
The present invention provides a method of producing an isolated enzyme according to the invention, wherein a suitable host cell, which has been transformed with a DNA sequence encoding the enzyme, is cultured under conditions permitting the production of the enzyme, and the resulting enzyme is recovered from the culture.<br>
When an expression vector comprising a DNA sequence encoding the enzyme is transformed into a heterologous host cell it is possible to enable heterologous recombinant production of :he enzyme of the invention.<br>
Thereby it is possible to make a highly purified 3ubtilase composition, characterized in being free from homologous impurities.<br><br>
In this context homologous impurities means any impurities (e.g. other polypeptides than the enzyme of the invention) which originate from the homologous cell where the enzyme of the invention is originally obtained from.<br>
The medium used to culture the transformed host cells may be any conventional medium suitable for growing the host cells in question. The expressed subtilase may conveniently be secreted into the culture medium and may be recovered therefrom by well-known procedures including separating the cells from the medium by centrifugation or filtration, precipitating proteinaceous components of the medium by means of a salt such as ammonium sulfate, followed by chromatographic procedures such as ion exchange chromatography, affinity chromatography, or the like.<br>

PROTEOLYTIC ACTIVITY<br>
In the context of this invention proteolytic activity is expressed in Kilo NOVO Protease Units (KNPU) . The activity is<br>
determined relatively to an enzyme standard (SAVINASE ) , and the determination is based on the digestion of a dimethyl casein (DMC) solution by the proteolytic enzyme at standard conditions, i.e. 50°C, pH 8.3, 9 min. reaction time, 3 min. measuring time. A folder AF 220/1 is available upon request to Novo Nordisk A/S, Denmark, which folder is hereby included by reference.<br>
A GU is a Glycine Unit, defined as the proteolytic enzyme activity which, under standard conditions, during a 15 minutes" incubation at 40°C, with N-acetyl casein as substrate, produces an amount of NH2-group equivalent to 1 mmole of glycine.<br>
Enzyme activity can also be measured using the PNA assay, according to reaction with the soluble substrate succinyl-alanine-alanine-proline-phenyl-alanine-para-nit ro-phenol, which is described in the Journal of American Oil Chemists Society, Rothgeb, T.M., Goodlander, B.D., Garrison, P.H., and Smith, L.A., (1988).<br>
FERMENTATION:<br><br>
Fermentations for the production of subtilase enzymes were performed at 30°C on a rotary shaking table (300 r.p.m.) in 500 ml baffled Erlenmeyer flasks containing 100 ml BPX medium for 5 days.<br>
Consequently in order to make an e.g. 2 liter broth 20 Jlrlenmeyer flasks were fermented simultaneously.<br>

EXAMPLE 1<br>
CONSTRUCTION AND EXPRESSION OF ENZYME VARIANTS: SITE-DIRECTED MUTAGENESIS:<br>
Subtilase 309 site-directed variants of the invention comprising specific insertions in the active site loop (b) between positions 103 and 104 were made by traditional cloning of DNA fragments (Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed., Cold Spring Harbor, 1989) produced by PCR of oligos containing the desired insertions (see below) .<br><br>
The template plasmid DNA was pJS3, or an analogue of this containing a variant of Subtilase 309._<br>
Insertions were introduced by oligo directed mutagenesis to the construction of  S103SX insertion variants (X = any amino acid residue inserted between positions 103 and 104) resulting in S103SX subtilase 309 variants.<br>
The Subtilase 3 09 variants were transformed into E.   coli. DNA purified from a over -night culture of these transformants were transformed into B.   subtilis  by<br>
restriction endonuclease digestion, purification of DNA fragments, ligation, transformation of B.   subtilis. Transformation of B. subtilis was performed as described by Dubnau et al. , 1971, J. Mol. Biol. 56, pp. 209-221.<br>
LOCALIZED RANDOM MUTAGENESIS IN ORDER TO INSERT RANDOM INSERTIONS IN A LOCALIZED REGION:<br>
The overall strategy to used to perform localized random nutagenesis was:<br>
A mutagenic primer (oligonucleotide) was synthesized, chat corresponds to the DNA sequence flanking the site of insertion, separated by the DNA base pairs defining the insertion.<br>
Subsequently, the resulting mutagenic primer was used in a PCR reaction with a suitable opposite primer. The resulting PCR fragment was purified and extended in a second PCR-reaction, before being digested by endonucleases and cloned into the E. coli   -  B.   subtilis  shuttle vector (see below).<br>
Alternatively, and if necessary, the resulting PCR fragment is used in a second PCR reaction as a primer with a second suitable opposite primer to allow digestion and cloning of the mutagenized region into the shuttle vector. The PCR reactions are performed under normal conditions.<br><br>
Following this strategy a localized random library was constructed in SAVINASE wherein insertions were introduced in the active site loop region between positions 103 and 104.<br>
The mutations were introduced by mutagenic primers (see below); so that all 20 amino acids are represented (N = 25% of A, T, C, and G; whereas S = 50% C and G. The produced PCR fragment were extended towards the N-terminal of Savinase by another round of PCR by combination of a overlapping sequence with a PCR-fragment produced by PCR-amplification with primers; 5" CTA AAT ATT CGT GGTGGC GC 3" {sense)   and 5" GAC TTT AAC AGC GTA TAG CTC AGC 3" (antisense) . The extended DNA-fragments were cloned into the Hind III- and Mlu I- sites of the modified plasmid pJS3 (see above) , and ten randomly chosen E.   coli colonies were seguenced to confirm the mutations designed.<br>
The mutagenic primer (5" CTA GGG GCG AGC GGT TCA GGT TCG NNS GTC AGC TCG ATT GCC CAA GGA TTG 3" (sense))   were used in a PCR reaction with a suitable anti-sense  opposite primer, situated downstream of the Mlu I site in pJS3 (e.g.   5"- CCC TTT AAC CGC ACA GCG TTT -3" (anti-sense) )   and the plasmid pJS3 as template. This resulting PCR product was cloned into the pJS3 shuttle vector by using the restriction enzymes Hind III and Mlu I.<br>
The random library was transformed into E. coli by well known techniques .<br>
The library prepared contained approximately 100,000 individual clones/library.<br>
Ten randomly chosen colonies were sequenced to confirm the mutations designed.<br>
In order to purify a subtilase variant of the invention, the B.   subtilis  pJS3 expression plasmid comprising a variant of the invention was transformed into a competent B.   subtilis<br><br>
strain and was fermented as described above in a medium containing 10 ^g/ml Chloramphenicol (CAM).<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
PURIFICATION OF ENZYME VARIANTS:<br>
This procedure relates to purification of a 2 liter scale fermentation for the production of the subtilases of the invention in a Bacillus  host cell.<br>
Approximately 1.6 liters of fermentation broth were centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 35 minutes in 1 liter beakers. The supernatants were adjusted to pH 6.5 using 10% acetic acid and filtered on Seitz Supra S100 filter plates.<br>
The filtrates were concentrated to approximately 400 ml using an Amicon CH2A UF unit equipped with an Amicon S1Y10 UF cartridge. The UF concentrate was centrifuged and filtered prior to absorption at room temperature on a Bacitracin affinity column at pH 7. The protease was eluted from the Bacitracin column at room temperature using 25% 2-propanol and 1 M sodium chloride in a buffer solution with 0.01 dimethylglutaric acid, 0.1 M boric acid and 0.002 M calcium chloride adjusted to pH 7.<br>
The fractions with protease activity from the Bacitracin purification step were combined and applied to a 750 ml Sephadex G25 column (5 cm dia.) equilibrated with a buffer containing 0.01 dimethylglutaric acid, 0.2 M boric acid and 0.002 m calcium chloride adjusted to pH 6.5.<br>
Fractions with proteolytic activity from the Sephadex G25 column were combined and applied to a 150 ml CM Sepharose CL 6B cation exchange column (5 cm dia.) equilibrated with a buffer containing 0.01 M dimethylglutaric acid, 0.2 M boric acid, and 0.002 M calcium chloride adjusted to pH 6.5.<br><br>
The protease was eluted using a linear gradient of 0-0.1 M sodium chloride in 2 litres of the same buffer (0-0.2 M sodium chloride in case of Subtilisin 147).<br>
In a final purification step protease containing fractions from the CM Sepharose column were combined and con¬centrated in an Amicon ultrafiltration cell equipped with a GR81PP membrane (from the Danish Sugar Factories Inc.).<br>
By using the techniques of Example 1 for the construction and fermentation, and the above isolation procedure the following subtilisin 3 09 variants were produced and isolated:<br><br>
These variants exhibited a better wash performance than Savinase in a preliminary assay.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
WASH PERFORMANCE OF DETERGENT COMPOSITIONS COMPRISING ENZYME VARIANTS<br>
The following examples provide results from a number of washing tests that were conducted under the conditions indicated<br><br><br>
DETERGENTS:<br>
The detergents used were obtained from supermarkets in Denmark (0M0, datasheet ED-9745105) and the USA (Wisk, datasheet ED-9711893), respectively. Prior to use all enzymatic activity in the detergents was inactivated by micro wave treatment.<br>
SWATCHES;<br>
The swatches used were EMPA116 and EMPA117, obtained from EMPA Testmaterialen, Movenstrasse 12, CH-9015 St. Gall, Switzerland.<br>
REFLECTANCE<br>
Measurement of reflectance (R) on the test material was done at 460 nm using a Macbeth ColorEye 70 0 0 photometer. The measurements were done according to the manufacturers protocol.<br><br>
EVALUATION<br>
The evaluation of the wash performance of a subtilase is determined by either the improvement factor or the performance factor for the subtilase iinvestigated.<br>
The improvement factor, IFDose/response" is defined as the ratio between the slopes of the wash performance curves for a detergent containing the subtilase investigated and the same detergent containing a reference subtilase at the asymptotic concentration of the subtilase goes to zero<br><br><br>
with lOnM Savinase; Rblank is the reflectance of test material washed with no enzyme US (detergent: US Wisk, Swatch: EMPA117)<br><br>
The substilases of the inventions are thus seen to exhibit improved wash performance in comparison to Savinase.<br>
