The present invention relates to a vehicle body front structure for an automobile and, more particularly, to a cabin reinforcing structure for an automobile.<br>
An automobile or the like is required to use a reinforcing structure that can restrain deformation of a cabin when an excessive impulsive force is applied from the front. The following is a brief description of the reason for this.<br>
FIG* 10 shows a vehicle front portion of an automobile in a normal state, and FIG* 11 shows a deformed state of the vehicle front portion in the case where an excessive impulsive force is applied from the front to the vehicle front portion of the automobile. In FIGS, 10 and 11, reference numeral 1 denotes an engine room provided at the front part of the automobile, 2 denotes an engine (including a transmission) mounted in the engine room 1, 3 denotes a cabin, and 4 denotes a dash panel which is disposed between the engine room 1 and the cabin 3 to partition the front part of the cabin 3. Also, reference numerals 5a and 5b denote a pair of front pillars, right and left, at the front part of the vehicle, 6a and 6b denote a pair of dash side panels, right and left, which are attached to the front pillars 5a and 5b and disposed at the side of the dash panel 4, 7a and 7b denote a pair of suspension upper brackets.<br><br>
right and left, which are attached to the upper end portions of suspension towers 8a and 8b disposed at the right and left in the engine room 1 and to which the upper end portion of a suspension strut (not shown) is assembled, 9 denotes a cowl box composing the lower part of front window (not shown), and 10 denotes a steering wheel.<br>
When an excessive impulsive force is applied from the front to the vehicle front portion of the automobile, the engine 2 mounted in the engine room 1 is pushed to move to the rear of the vehicle body by the impulsive force, so that the dash panel 4 between the paired suspension upper brackets 7a and 7b and the cowl box 9 are deformed into a curved shape or a bent shape toward the vehicle body rear side as shown in FIG. 11. Accordingly, portions on the side of the engine room 1 of the dash side panels 6a and 6b may be bent toward the inside of the engine room 1, and the suspension upper brackets 7a and 7b may be tilted toward the inside of the engine room 1. If such deformation has been caused, the room space of the cabin 3 is decreased, and a trouble such that the steering wheel 10 is moved backward occurs. Therefore, a structure such that the above-described deformation of the vehicle body front portion, that is, the deformation amounts indicated by reference characters a and p in FIG, 11 can be decreased is demanded as countermeasures against, a shock.<br>
Conventionally, in order to reduce the deformation amount<br><br>
(deformation amount in the vehicle body longitudinal direction of the dash panel 4 and the cowl box 9) indicated by reference character a, as shown in FIG. 12, a reinforcement 11 extending from the front pillar 5a, 5b to the suspension upper bracliet 7a, 7b is attached to a surface 12 on the cabin outside of the dash panel 6a, 6b,<br>
However, the conventional vehicle body front structure as described above has a problem in that although the deformation amount in the vehicle body longitudinal direction indicated by reference character a can be kept small by the presence of the reinforcement 11, so that the deformation in the vehicle body longitudinal direction can be decreased, this structure is not effective in reducing the deformation amount (the deformation amount of the dash panel 4 caused by the suspension upper brackets 7a and 7b deformed so as to be tilted to the inside) indicated by reference character p. Specifically, since the reinforcement 11 is disposed on the surface 12 on the cabin outside of the dash panel 6a, 6b, a separation may occur between the reinforcement 11 and the dash side panel 6a, 6b when a shock is caused, and the reinforcement 11 cannot perform a function as a support member for the suspension upper bracket 7a, 7b. For this reason, the effect of preventing a phenomenon that the suspension upper bracket 7a, 7b is turned to the inside and tilted cannot be anticipated so much. Therefore, the structure in which the reinforcement 11 is disposed on the surface 12 on<br><br>
the cabin outside of the dash panel 6a, 6b is actually not effective as a means for reducing the deformation amount<br>
indicated by reference character p.<br>
Also, since the reinforcement 11 is arranged so as to stride many other parts, there is presented a problem in that the welding and assembling work for the reinforcement 11 is complicated and troublesome, and the part dimensions of the reinforcement 11 increase inevitably,<br>
OBJECT AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention has been made in view of the above situation, and accordingly an object thereof is to provide a vehicle body front structure for an automobile, which is configured so that when an excessive impulsive force is applied from the front side to the vehicle body front portion, the retreat (deformation) of a dash panel and a cowl box due to the deformation of a dash side panel and the deformation of the dash panel and the cowl box due to the tilting of a suspension upper bracket to the inside of an engine room can be restrained effectively, the welding and assembling work for a reinforcement can be performed easily, and there is no water leakage and other troubles at the disposition position of the reinforcement -<br>
To achieve the above object, in the present invention, a reinforcement is attached to a surface on the cabin side of a dash side panel which is disposed at the side of a dash panel<br><br>
for partitioning the front portion of a cabin and is connected to a front pillar.<br>
Also, in the present invention, the reinforcement is a member formed into a closed cross-sectional shape, or is a member forming a closed cross-sectional shape together with the dash side panel in a state of being attached to the dash side panel.<br>
Also, in the present invention, the reinforcement is arranged at almost the same height position as that of a suspension upper bracket disposed at the side of the dash side panel, and the reinforcement is connected to the front pillar via the dash side panel at the height position.<br>
Also, in the present invention, a cross member extending in the vehicle width direction is disposed as a reinforcement on a surface on the cabin side of the dash panel partitioning the front portion of the cabin and at a position lower than a cowl box.<br>
Also, in the present invention, the cross member is disposed between a pair of suspension upper brackets, right and left, to connect the paired suspension upper brackets via the cross member,<br>

An embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to FIGS. 1 to 9. In FIGS. 1 to 9, the same reference numerals are applied to the same elements as those shown in FIGS. 10 to 12, and the duplicate explanation is omitted.<br>
FIGS, 1 to 4 show a vehicle body front structure in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.  In this embodiment, as shown in FIG. 1, a reinforcement 20 having a closed cross-sectional shape is installed to a dash side panel 6 from the cabin inside. More specifically, as shown in FIG. 1, the dash side panel 6 is joined to a front pillar 5 by welding or the like, and a side end portion 4a of a dash panel 4 is joined to the dash side panel 6 by welding or the like. The reinforcement 20 is attached by welding or the like to a surface 21 on the cabin side of the dash side panel 6 disposed at the side of the dash panel 4. The reinforcement 20 is a member formed into a closed cross-sectional shape, or is a member forming a closed cross-sectional shape together with the dash side panel 6 in a state of being attached to the dash side panel 6.  The arrangement position of the reinforcement 20 on the surface 21 is a height position which is almost the same as the<br><br>
height position of a suspension upper bracket 7 disposed at the upper end portion of a suspension tower 8 and is lower than a cowl box 9. Thus, the reinforcement 20 is connected to the front pillar 5 by welding via the dash side panel 6 at almost the same height as that of the suspension upper bracket 7,<br>
According to this configuration, since the reinforcement 20 is attached to the surface 21 on the cabin side of the dash side panel 6 and is disposed at almost the same height position as that of the suspension upper bracket 7, when an excessive impulsive force is applied from the front side to the vehicle body front portion, the reinforcement 20 can sufficiently receive the dash panel 4 and the suspension upper bracket 7 which are to be deformed and moved by the impulsive force* Specifically, the reinforcement 20 attached on the cabin inside can receive and support the dash panel 4 and the suspension upper bracket 7 without a separation being caused between the reinforcement 20 and the dash side panel 6. This restrains the occurrence of deformation movement such that the suspension upper bracket 7 is tilted to the inside of an engine room 1, that is, in the direction such that the right and left suspension upper brackets 7 come close to each other, so that the<br>
deformation amount indicated by reference character p in FIG. 11, that is, the deformation amount of the dash panel 4 caused by the suspension upper 'bracket 7 deformed so as to be tilted to the Inside can be decreased. The presence of the<br><br>
reinforcement 20 enables an excessive impulsive force applied to the vehicle body front portion to be transmitted directly to the front pillar 5 efficiently. Therefore, the shock energy can be received by the strong front pillar 5, and the retreat amount indicated by reference character a in FIG. 11. that is, the retreat amount of the dash panel 4 and the suspension upper bracket 7 caused by the def©^"i^^io'^ °^ ^^® ^^^^  side panel 6<br>
can be decreased.<br>
Further, since the reinforcement 20 is attached to the dash side panel 6 from the cabin inside as described above, the reinforcement 20 can be dispose*^ on the dash side panel 6 without striding other parts. Therefo^re, by using this configuration, the work for assembling and welding the reinforcement 20 to the dash side panel 6 can be performed easily, and moreover the shape of the reinforcement 20 can b© "»ade small. In addition, since the reinforcement 20 is disposed on the cabin inside, there is no fear of water leakage ts^ora  the joint portion of the reinforcement 20. Therefore, a sealer etc. for preventing water leakage need not be used, so that the cost reduction can<br>
be achieved.<br>
In this embodiment, as shown in FIGS. 3 and 4, on a surface (front surface of the dash pa^el body) 22 on the cabin side of the dash panel 4, there is disposed a cross member 23 extending in the vehicle width direction over the total length of the dash panel 4 . The cross member 23 , which is formed by bending a steel<br><br>
plate, are disposed between the paired suspension upper brackets 7, right and left, to connect these elements to reinforce the vehicle body front portion. The cross member 23 is disposed as follows: At an upper edge 4b of the dash panel 4, the upper and lower end portions 23a and 23b of the cross member 23 are caused to abut on a dash panel portion P^ composing the inner panel portion of the cowl box 9 and a dash panel portion Pj corresponding to the suspension upper bracket 7, and are connected by spot welds S^, Sj and S3 (see FIG, 4) .  In this case, the lower end portion 23b of the cross member 23 is connected to the suspension upper bracket 7 together with the dash panel portion Pj by spot welds S^.    The intermediate portion at the right and left of the cross member 23 is attached to the upper edge 4b of the dash panel 4 by spot welds S^ or the like at a plurality of places (see FIG. 3). Therefore, the paired suspension upper brackets 7 are connected to each other by the cross member 23, and the cross member 23 connecting the paired suspension upper brackets 7 to each other is installed on the cabin inside of the dash panel 4 as one reinforcement.<br>
The cross member 23 is connected to the dash panel 4 together with existing reinforcements 24, which have been attached to the dash panel 4 conventionally, so that the right and left suspension upper brackets 7 are connected to each other via not only the cross member 23 but also the existing reinforcements 24.<br><br>
By this configuration, since the cross member 23 is disposed on the dash panel 4 at the lower position of the cowl box 9, the dash panel 4 and the cowl box 9 are reinforced by the cross member 23, so that even when an excessive impulsive force is applied to the vehicle body front portion, the intrusion amount (deformation movement amount) into the cabin of the dash panel 4 and the cowl box 9 can be kept small- Also, since the right and left suspension upper brackets 7 are connected to each other via the cross member 23 and the existing reinforcements 24 as described above, a greater reinforcing effect can be achieved as compared with the case where the suspension upper brackets 7 are connected by the cross member 23 only. Also, since the right and left suspension upper brackets 7 are connected to each other by the cross member 23, the tilting of the suspension upper bracket 7 into the engine room 1 can be prevented effectively- Further, since the cross member 23 is installed to the cabin inside as in the case of the reinforcement 20 described before, the assembling and welding work is simple, and there is no fear of the occurrence of water leakage and other troubles.<br>
The above is a description of one embodiment of the present invention. The present invention is not limited to this embodiment, and various modifications and changes can be made on the basis of the technical concept of the present invention.<br>
For example, the reinforcement 20 having a closed<br><br>
cross-sectional shape, which is disposed on the surface 21 on the cabin inside of the dash side panel 6 can be configured so as to be welded to the surface 21 on the cabin inside of the dash side panel 6 and additionally to be welded to the surface 22 of the dash panel 4. In this case, since the reinforcement 20 is welded to the dash panel 4 as well, the deformation of the dash side panel 6 and the suspension upper bracket 7 can be restrained more effectively- Also, the reinforcement 20 need not necessarily be connected to the dash panel 4, and may be disposed apart from the surface 22 of the dash panel 4. In this case, a reinforcement portion 20a (see FIG. 6) corresponding to the dash panel 4 is preferably disposed so as to be capable of receiving the surface 22 as widely as possible at a position close to the surface 22 of the dash panel 4*<br>
Also, although the disposition position (height position) of the cross member 23 is set in accordance with the difference in position (difference in height position) between the cowl box 9 and the suspension upper bracket 7, when the difference in position is slightly larger than the case shown in FIG, 4, it is necessary only that the cross member 23 having bent flange portions 23d and 23e on both sides, upper and lower, of a body portion 23c having a U shape in cross section is disposed from the lower end portion of the cowl box 9 to the portion corresponding to the sust&gt;ension upper bracket 7, and is welded to the surface 22 on the cabin side of the dash panel 4 as shown<br><br>
in FIG. 7. Also, when the difference in position is especially large, it is necessary only that the cross member 23 is welded to the surface 22 on the cabin side of the dash panel 4 at an intermediate height position of the dash panel 4 as shown in FIGS, 8 and 9- FIG* 8 shows an example in which the cross member 23 is attached to an existing reinforcement 30, which is also used as a booster attaching member, by spot welds Ss to further increase a connection strength of the paired suspension upper brackets by means of the cross member 23, and in turn, to increase a reinforcing effect.<br>
As described above, the present invention provides a vehicle body front structure for an automobile, in which a reinforcement is attached to a surface on the cabin side of a dash side panel which is disposed at the side of a dash panel for partitioning the front portion of a cabin and is connected to a front pillar. Therefore, when an excessive impulsive force is applied from the front side to the vehicle body front portion, the reinforcement attached on the cabin inside can receive and support the dash panel and the suspension upper bracket without a separation being caused between the reinforcement and the dash side panel, and in turn, the occurrence of deformation movement such that the suspension upper bracket is tilted to the inside of an engine room, that is, in the direction such that the right and left suspension upper brackets come close to each other can be restrained effectively* Also, since the reinforcement is<br><br>
attached to the surface on the cabin side of the dash side panel, the reinforcement can be disposed on the dash side panel without striding other parts. Therefore, the work for assembling and welding the reinforcement to the dash side panel can be performed easily. Moreover, although the configuration of reinforcement striding other parts makes the reinforcement large, the reinforcement need not take such a shape, so that the reinforcement is made small in size. Further, since the reinforcement is disposed on the cabin inside, there is no fear of water leakage from the joint portion of the reinforcement. Therefore, a sealer etc. for preventing water leakage need not be used, so that the cost reduction can be achieved•<br>
Also, in the present invention defined in claim 2, the reinforcement is a member formed into a closed cross-sectional shape, or is a member forming a closed cross-sectional shape together with the dash side panel in a state of being attached to the dash side panel. Therefore, the presence of the closed cross-sectional shape at a location where the reinforcement is disposed far sufficiently secures a strength at the location where the reinforcement is disposed, and in turn, provides a sufficient reinforcing structure,<br>
Also, in the present invention defined in claim 3, the reinforcement is arranged at almost the same height position as that of a suspension upper bracket disposed at the side of the dash side panel, and the reinforcement is connected to the<br><br>
front pillar via the dash side panel at the height position. Therefore, when an excessive impulsive force is applied from the front side to the vehicle body front portion, the occurrence of deformation movement such that the suspension upper bracket is tilted to the inside of an engine room, that is, in the direction such that the right and left suspension upper brackets come close to each other can be restrained effectively. Also, The presence of the reinforcement disposed at almost the same height position as that of the suspension upper bracket enables an excessive impulsive force applied to the vehicle body front portion to be transmitted directly to the front pillar efficiently- Therefore, the shock energy can be received by the strong front pillar, and the deformation amount of the cowl box and the dash panel can be decreased.<br>
The present invention defined in claim 4 provides a vehicle body front structure for an automobile, in which a cross member extending in the vehicle width direction is disposed as a reinforcement on a surface on the cabin side of a dash panel partitioning the front portion of a cabin and at a position lower than a cowl box. Therefore, since the cross member is disposed on the dash panel at a position lower than a cowl box, the dash panel and the cowl box are reinforced by the cross member, so that even if an excessive impulsive force is applied to the vehicle body front portion, the intrusion amount (deformation movement amount) into the cabin of the dash panel and the cowl<br><br>
box can be kept small. Also, since the cross member is attached to the dash panel from the cabin side, the assembling and welding work is simple, and there is no fear of the occurrence of water leakage and other troubles.<br>
In the present invention defined in claim 5, the cross member is disposed between a pair of suspension upper brackets, right and left, to connect the paired suspension upper brackets via the cross member. Therefore, the tilting of the suspension upper bracket into the engine room, that is, the tilting thereof in the direction such that the paired suspension upper brackets come close to each other can be prevented effectively.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
