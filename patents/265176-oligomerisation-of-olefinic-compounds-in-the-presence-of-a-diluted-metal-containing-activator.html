				<td>OLIGOMERISATION OF OLEFINIC COMPOUNDS IN THE PRESENCE OF A DILUTED METAL CONTAINING ACTIVATOR<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates to the oligomerisation of olefinic compounds in the presence of a diluted oligomerisation catalyst activated by a metal containing activator.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
A number of different oligomerisation technologies are known to produce a-olefins. Some of these processes, including the Shell Higher Olefins Process and Ziegler-type technologies, have been summarized in WO 04/056479 A1. The same document also discloses that the prior art (e.g. WO 03/053891 and WO 02/04119) teaches that chromium based catalysts containing heteroaromatic ligands with both phosphorus and nitrogen heteroatoms, selectively catalyse the trimerisation of ethylene to 1-hexene.<br>
Processes wherein transition metals and heteroaromatic ligands are combined to form catalysts for trimerisation, tetramerisation, oligomerisation and polymerisation of olefinic compounds have also been described in different patent applications such as WO 03/053890 A1; WO 03/053891; WO 04/056479 A1; WO 04/056477 A1; WO 04/056480 A1; WO 04/056478 A1; WO 05/11*3884 A2; WO 05/123633 A1 and USA Complete Patent Application No. 11/130,106.<br>
The   catalysts   utilized   in   the   abovementioned   trimerisation,   tetramerisation, Dligomerisation or polymerisation processes all include one or more activators to<br>
activate the catalyst. Such an activator is a compound that generates an active catalyst when the activator Is combined with the catalyst.<br>
Suitable activators include organoaluminium compounds, organoboron compounds, organic salts, such as methyl lithium and methyl magnesium bromide, inorganic acids and salts, such as tetrafluoroboric acid etherate, silver tetrafluoroborate, sodium hexafluoroantimonate and the like.<br>
It is desirable to run a commercial oligomerisation process (e.g. ethylene tetramerisation) at low activator concentrations, especially where the activator is an aluminium containing compound, because the activators (especially aluminium containing compounds) are expensive.<br>
However, in the case where an aluminium containing compound was used as an activator for transition metal based oligomerisation catalysts, it was found that at conditions of low starting aluminium concentrations (e.g. 
Most surprising it has now been found that if activation of the catalyst by a metal containing activator in the presence of an olefinic compound takes place in the presence of a relatively high concentration of the metal of the metal containing activator, the activated catalyst can be subsequently diluted by an introduced liquid medium, and oligomerisation of the olefinic compound can take place at a relatively low concentration of the metal of the metal containing activator.<br>
in addition, the applicant has found that greater dilution of the catalyst with an introduced liquid medium after activation, increases the ratio of oiefinic compound (e.g. ethylene) to primary reaction products (e.g. hexene or octene) in the reaction mixture, thus reducing the formation of secondary products (olefins of carbon number CIO or higher).<br>
WO 02/04119 (e.g. in example 10) discloses preparation of a catalyst by combining a source of chromium with a tigand in a solvent. The solvent was then removed, the solid reaction product was suspended in toluene, and MAO was then added at a concentration of about 600 mmoJ/t The subsequent solution was then injected into an autoclave containing a diluent in the form of isobutene, and ethylene trimerisation commenced at 8 bar ethylene pressure and 50°C.<br>
It will be appreciated that in the above case of WO 02/04119, as well as the other prior art cases referred lo above, no dilution of the activated catalyst by an introduced liquid medium took place after the catalyst was activated by the activator in the presence of an oiefinic compound. As illustrated by the comparative examples of the present invention, activation of the catalyst by the activator in the presence of an oiefinic compound prior to dilution can have a marked improvement in respect of reduced solids formation while retaining acceptable reaction rates or possibly even improving them.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>

Most surprisingly it has been found that under the conditions stated above, the oligornerisation does not result in unacceptable high polymerisation products such solids formation despite low concentrations of the metal of the metal containing activator after dilution of the activated catalyst, even where such concentrations are below 6 mmol/t Such solids formation may be below 5 mass %, preferably below 2.5 mass %; and more preferably below 1 mass % where ethylene is the olefinic compound to be oligomerised.<br>
It was also most surprisingly found that under such conditions the catalyst activity was acceptably high preferably above 50 000 g/g M/h, preferably above 100 000 g/g M/h and more preferably above 500 000 g/g M/h where M is the transition metal (preferably Cr) of the source of transition metal in the activated oligomerisati'on catalyst.<br>
Activation<br>
The metal containing activator may be a compound that generates an active catalyst when the activator is combined with the source of the transition metal, the I/gating compound and the olefinic compound.<br>
Preferably   the   activator   is   an   aluminium   containing   compound   such   as   an organoaluminium compound.<br>
Suitable aluminium containing compounds include compounds of the formula AI(R3)3 (R9 being the same or different), where each R3 is independently a C1-C12 alkyl, an oxygen containing moiety or a halide; aluminoxanes; and compounds such as LiAIH4 and the like. Aluminoxanes are well  known  in  the art as typically  oligomeric compounds which can be prepared by the controlled addition of water to an alkylaluminium compound, for example trimethylaluminium. In addition, there also exist non-hydrolytic routes for the preparation these compounds. Aluminoxanes can be  linear,  cyclic,  cages or mixtures  thereof.  Examples of  suitable  aluminium containing   compounds   in   the   form   of   organoaluminium   activators   include trimethylaluminium (TMA), triethylaluminium (TEA), tri-isobutyfaluminium (TIBA), tri-n-octylaluminium,      methylaluminium      dichloride,      ethylaluminium      dichloride, dimethylaluminium  chloride,   diethylaluminium   chloride,   aluminium   isopropoxide, ethylaluminiumsesquichloride.   methylaluminiumsesquichloride,  methylaluminoxane (MAO),     ethylaJuminoxane    (EAO),     isobutylaluminoxane    (iBuAO),     modified alkylaluminoxanes such as modified methylaluminoxane (MMAO) and mixtures thereof.<br>

The process may include the step of adding to the catalyst system a trialkylaluminium compound in amounts of between 0.01 to 1000 mol per mol of alkylaluminoxane.<br>
a<br>
It should be noted that aluminoxanes generally also contain considerable quantities of the corresponding trialkylaluminium compounds used in their preparation. The presence of these trialkylaluminium compounds in aJuminoxanes can be attributed to their incomplete conversion during the preparation of aluminoxanes. Any quantity of trialkylaluminium compound quoted in this disclosure is additional to alkylaluminium compounds contained within the aluminoxanes.<br>
Preferably the concentration of the metal (especially aluminium) of the metal containing activator in the activated catalyst prior to dilution is at least 3 mmol/t, preferably at least 6 mmol/f, preferably at least 9 mmol/e, preferably at least 12 mmol/f and even as high as 24 mmol/f or even higher.

The ligating compound may include a polymeric moiety to render the reaction product of the source of transition metal and the said ligating compound to be soluble at higher temperatures and insoluble at lower temperatures e.g. 25°C. This approach may enable the recovery of the complex from the reaction mixture for re-use and has been used for other catalyst as described by D.E. Bergbreiter et at., J. Am. Chem. Soc.. 1987, 109, 177-179. In a similar vein these transition metal catalysts can also be immobilised by binding the ligating compound to silica, silica gel, polysiloxane or alumina backbone as, for example, demonstrated by C. Yuanyin et a/., Chinese J. React. Pol., 1992,1(2), 152-159 for immobilising platinum complexes.<br>

The ligating compounds may be prepared using procedures known to one skilled in the art and procedures forming part of the state of the art.<br><br>
Catalyst preparation<br>
The process may include the step of preparing the activated catalyst.<br>
It is foreseen that i) the source of the transition metal and ii) the said ligating compound (e.g. referred to in A) may be first reacted together and the resulting product may even be isolated, before combining it with the metal containing activator iii). However, i), ii) and iii) may be combined in any suitable order in the presence of the olefinic compound iv), but preferably at least some, but preferably all of i), ii) and iii) are first combined and subsequently contacted with the olefinic compound iv).<br>
The olefinic compound referred to in iv) is preferably the same as the olefinic compound to be oligomerised.<br>
The contacting of the olefinic compound iv) with compounds i) to iii) preferably takes place under conditions to allow oligomerisation of the olefinic compound iv). These conditions are well known to a person skilled in the art and include elevated temperatures and pressure. Preferably it is carried out at a temperature of at least 0°C, preferably at least 40°C, and preferably at least 50°C. Preferably it is carried out at a pressure of at least 100 kPa, preferably at least 1000 kPa, preferably at least 3000 kPa.<br>
The preparation of the activated catalyst may be carried out in a liquid medium, Dreferably an inert liquid medium. The liquid medium may be the same liquid medium wherein the oligomerisation with the diluted catalyst is carried out.<br>
The activated oligomerisalion catalyst before dilution may be prepared in the same container as the one in which the diluted activated oligomerisation catalyst is<br>
contacted with the olefinic compound to be oligomerised. Preferably the activated oligomerisation catalyst before dilution is prepared in a separate container as the one in which the oligomerisation catalyst is contacted with the olefinic compound to be oligomerised.<br>
The source of transition metal (preferably chromium) and ligating compound may be combined to provide any suitable molar ratio, preferably a transition metal to ligand compound molar ratio, from about 0.01 : 100 to 10 000 : 1, preferably from about 0.1 : 1 to 10:1.<br>
The process may also include combining one or more different sources of transition metal with one or more different ligating compounds.<br>
The oligomerisation catalyst or its individual components, in accordance with the invention, may also be immobilised by supporting it on a support material, for example, silica, alumina, MgCI?, zirconia, artificial hectorite or smectorite clays such as Laponite™ RD or mixtures thereof, or on a polymer, for example polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, or poly(aminostyrene). The catalyst can be formed in situ in the presence of the support material, or the support can be pre-impregnated or premixed,  simultaneously or sequentially,   with   one  or  more  of  the  catalyst components or the oligomerisation catalyst. In some cases, the support material can also act as a component of the activator. This approach would also facilitate the recovery of the catalyst from the reaction mixture for reuse.<br>
Dilution of the activated catalyst<br>
As stated above the activated catalyst is diluted with an introduced liquid medium, preferably in order to reduce the concentration of the metal (preferably aluminium) ofthe metal containing activator before contacting the activated catalyst with the olefinic compound to be oligomerised.<br>
The introduced liquid medium may the same as an oligomerisation product produced by the process, except that it is introduced from an external source. Accordingly the introduced liquid medium may be an olefinic moiety.<br>
Preferably the introduced liquid medium is different from the said oligomerisation product and preferably it is an inert liquid medium. The introduced liquid medium may be the same as a liquid medium wherein the oligomerisation with the diluted activated catalyst is carried out and which liquid medium is as described later in this specification.<br>
After dilution of the activated catalyst with the introduced liquid medium the concentration of the metal (preferably Al) of the metal containing activator is preferably not above 12 mmol/t, and preferably it Is below 9 mmol/e. Preferably it is below 6 mmol/£ and more preferably it is not above 3 mmol/f.<br>
Oliqomerisation with the diluted activated catalyst<br>
The oligomerisation with the diluted activated catalyst may be carried out at a pressure of above 1 bar, preferably above 10 bar, more preferably above 40 bar, preferably at 50 bar or even higher. Preferred pressure ranges are from 10 to 300 bar, more preferably from 30 to 100 bar.<br>
The said oligomerisation may be carried out at temperatures from -100 to 250°C, but temperatures in the range of 15 to 130°C are preferred. Particularly preferred temperatures range from 50 to 120°C.<br>
The said oligomerisation may be carried out in a liquid medium. Preferably the liquid medium is an inert liquid medium. The liquid medium may be aromatic (including heteroaromatic) or aliphatic.   Preferably the liquid medium comprises an aliphatic medium and the aliphatic liquid medium may comprise an acyclic compound or mixtures thereof, but preferably it comprises a cyclic compound or alkyl substituted derivatives thereof.   The cyclic compound may include hetero-atoms (that is atoms other that H and C), but preferably comprises a cyclic hydrocarbon.   The cyclic hydrocarbon may include one or more unsaturated carbon atoms, but preferably it is a  saturated  cyclic  hydrocarbon.     The   ring  structure  of  the  saturated  cyclic hydrocarbon may consist of 3 to 12 carbon atoms, preferably 5 to 8 carbon atoms. In one  embodiment   of  the  invention  the   ring  structure  of  the  saturated  cyclic hydrocarbon may consist of 6 carbon atoms.<br>
In one preferred embodiment of the invention the aliphatic liquid medium may comprise cyclohexane or methylcyclohexane. Last mentioned compound is especially suitable from a product separation / solvent recycle point of view in oligomerisation of ethylene.<br>
It has been found that aliphatic liquid mediums such as cyclohexane provide more active reaction systems (compared to aromatic liquid mediums) which can reduce catalyst usage. Aliphatic liquid mediums are also more environmentally friendly than aromatic compounds.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention the liquid medium is a solvent for the ofefinic compound and/or the oligomerisation catalyst, preferably of both.<br>
The olefinic compound or mixture thereof to be oligomerised according to this invention can be introduced into the process in a continuous or batch fashion.<br>
Preferably, the reaction conditions of the process are chosen such to produce oligomers (especially trimers and/or tetramers) in high yield by selectively converting an ethylenic feedstock such as ethylene.<br>
The process may include a process for the oligomerisation (especially tri-or tetramerisation) of ethylene or propylene or a mixture of olefins to yield an oligomerised product selectively.<br>
The reaction products derived from the oligomerisation reaction as described herein, may be prepared using the disclosed catalyst by a homogeneous liquid phase reaction in the presence or absence of an inert solvent, and/or by slurry reaction where the catalyst and the polymeric product is in a form that displays little or no solubility, and/or a two-phase liquid/liquid reaction, and/or a bulk phase reaction in which neat reagent and/or product olefins serve as the dominant medium, and/or gas i phase reaction, using conventional equipment and contacting techniques.<br>
The oligomerisation with the diluted activated catalyst may be carried out in a plant which includes reactor types known in the art. Examples of such reactors include, but are not limited to, batch reactors, semi-batch reactors and continuous reactors. The plant may include, in combination a) at least one reactor system, b) at least one inlet line into this reactor for olefin reactant and the catalyst system, c) effluent lines from this reactor for oligomerised reaction products, and d) at least one separator to separate the desired oligomerised reaction products, which may include a recycle loop for solvents and/or reactants and/or products which may also serve as a temperature control mechanism.<br>
The invention also relates to an oligomeric product produced by the process substantially as described hereinabove.<br>
The invention will now be further described by means of the following non-limiting examples.<br>
Examples<br>
The individual components of the examples may conceivably be omitted or substituted and, although not necessarily ideal, the invention may conceivably still be performed and these components are not to be taken as essential to the working of the invention.<br>
In the examples that follow all procedures were carried out under inert conditions, using pre-dried reagents. Chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich or Strem Chemicals   unless   stated   otherwise.   All   trialkylaluminium   and   aluminoxane compounds and solutions thereof were obtained from Crompton Gmbh, Akzo Nobel and   Albemarle    Corporation.    In    all    the    examples,    the    molar   mass    of methylaluminoxane   (MAO   and   MAO-HS)   was   taken   to   be   58.016   g/mol, corresponding to the (CH3-AI-O) unit, in order to calculate the molar quantities of MAO and MAO-HS used in the preparation of the catalysts described in the examples below. Similarly the molar mass of modified methylaluminoxane prepared from a 70:30 mixture of trimethylaluminium and tri-isobutylaluminium was taken as 70.7 g/mol corresponding to the (Me0.;(jisoBuo.3o-AI-O) unit. Ethylene oligomerisation products were analysed by GC-MS and GC-FID.<br>
The ligating compounds employed were prepared according to procedures disclosed in WO 2004/056479 and J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2004, 126, 14712 and references cited therein.<br>
Examples 1 to 6 are comparative batch run examples wherein no dilution of the activated catalyst (including the aluminium of the aluminium containing activator and an olefin) by means of an introduced liquid medium was done. After commencement of the oligomerisation reaction some dilution took place due to the formation of the liquid olefin oligomerisation product itself, but this is not dilution by means of a introduced liquid medium as described in this specification. The aluminium concentration ([Al]) during catalyst activation in the presence of an olefin and a significant part of the oligomerisation itself were consequently relatively similar.<br>
Examples 7 and 8 are according to the invention, that is activation in the presence of an olefin of the catalyst took place at a relatively high [Al] and oligomerisation after dilution of the activated catalyst took place at a relatively low [Al].<br>
Examples 9 is a further example wherein the procedure of examples 7 and 8 was followed, but the [Al] was substantially the same during activation of the catalyst in the presence of an olefin and during oligomerisation with the diluted activated catalyst.<br>

Apparatus for Examples 7-9<br>
Two inertised autoclave reactors of volumes 300ml (autoclave A) and t litre (autoclave B) and equipped with gas entraining stirrers were connected with a dip-tube from autoclave A as shown in Figure 1.

Autoclaves A and B were independently equipped with a supply of ethylene at 50 bar and 45 bar pressures respectively.<br>
Example 7<br>
Autoclave B was charged with methylcyclohexane (250 ml) and MMAO-3A (0.42 mmol Al). With ball-valve C closed, autoclave B was pressurised to 45 bar (4500 kPa) ethylene. Autoclave A was charged with methylcyclohexane (95 ml). In a Schfenk-tube, a mixture of Cr(acac)3 (5.0 umol), Ph2PN(iPr)PPh2 (5.0 umol) in methylcyclohexane (5 ml) was treated with MMAO-3A (2.395 mmol Al). After stirring for one minute, this mixture was transferred to autoclave A which was sealed and pressurised to 50 bar (5000 kPa) with ethylene. The mixture was stirred at 1100 r.p.m. to ensure thorough mass transfer. The uptake of ethylene into autoclave A was<br>
monitored, and the temperature and pressure were maintained at 60°C and 50 bar (5000 kPa). After 7 minutes, 58 g of ethylene uptake was recorded. Ball-valve C was opened for 5 seconds, thus forcing some of the reaction mixture from autoclave A into autoclave B.   The uptake of ethylene into autoclave B was monitored, and the temperature and pressure of autoclave B were maintained at 60"C and 45 bar (4500 kPa). The mixture was stirred at 1100 r.p.m. to ensure thorough mass transfer. After 35 minutes, the supply of ethylene was terminated and autoclave B was cooled to less than 15°C and slowly depressurised. A known mass of nonane was added as an internal standard. A sample of the liquid fraction was filtered and analysed by GC-FID.   The  mass   of  ethylene  oligomers   (305  g)   and   methylcyclohexane   was determined relative to this standard. From this, the amount of methylcyclohexane transferred to autoclave B was calculated (46 g), and hence the amount of Cr (3.0 mmol), Al (1.44 mmol) and oligomers (35 g) transferred. The mass of oligomers produced in autoclave B was thus determined to be 280 g. The solids were recovered by filtration and dried at 70°C. The mass was found to be 1.2.

The uptake of ethylene into autoclave B was monitored, and the temperature and pressure of autoclave B were maintained at 60°C and 45 bar (4500 kPa). The mixture was stirred at 1100 r.p.m. to ensure thorough mass transfer. After 120 minutes, the supply of ethylene was terminated and autoclave B was cooled to less than 15CC and slowly depressurised. A known mass of nonane was added as an internal standard. A sample of the liquid fraction was filtered and analysed by GC-FID.   The   mass  of  ethylene  oligomers   (164   g)   and  methylcyclohexane   was determined relative to this standard. From this, the amount of methylcyclohexane transferred to autoclave B was calculated (31 g), and hence the amount of Cr (1.0 mmol), Al (0.48 mmol) and oligomers (19 g) transferred. The mass of oligomers produced in autoclave B was thus determined to be 145 g. The solids were recovered by filtration and dried at 70°C. The mass was found to be 0.9 g.

A sample of the liquid fraction was filtered and analysed by GC-FID.  The   mass  of  ethylene  oligomers   (140   g)   and  methylcyclohexane   was determined relative to this standard. From this, the amount of methylcyclohexane transferred to autoclave B was calculated (34 g), and hence the amount of Cr (1.1 mmol), Al (0.53 mmol) and oligomers (21 g) transferred. The mass of oligomers produced in autoclave  B was thus determined to be  119 g. The solids were recovered by filtration and dried at 70°C. The mass was found to be 0.9 g.

An Inertised 2 liter autoclave equipped with gas entraining stirrer was connected via a control valve to a catch-pot (CP1) as shown in Figure 3. The autoclave was equipped with an ethylene supply line, catalyst and MMAO supply line and a solvent supply line. The catalyst, MMAO and solvent were continuously fed to the autoclave (pressurised to 45 bar with ethylene) in the correct volumes to maintain the desired concentration of Cr and Al, shown in Table 1, within the reactor. The liquid volume (1 liter) was kept constant by continuously removing liquid to CP1, operating at a slightly reduced pressure. The catch pot was sampled every 20 minutes in order to calculatethe solids and product make-up of the liquid which in turn was used to calculate the Cr efficiency.<br>
Example 29 (Dual-continuous stirred tank reactor)<br>
Two inertised autoclaves of volumes 300ml (autoclave C) and 5 litres (autoclave D), both equipped with gas entraining stirrers, were connected via a dip-tube leading from autoclave C to autoclave D, in order to ensure a constant volume of 100 ml in autoclave C. The connecting pipe was equipped with a sampling point (SP1) such that samples from autoclave C could be drawn to determine the reaction rate and solids content of autoclave C, while autoclave D was connected via a control valve to catch pot (CP1) at a slightly lower pressure as shown in Figure 4. Autoclave C was equipped with an ethylene supply line, catalyst and MMAO supply line and a solvent supply line (solvent 1) while autoclave D was only equipped with a solvent supply line (solvent 2). The catalyst, MMAO and solvent were continuously fed to autoclave C (pressurised to 45 bar with ethylene) to maintain the desired Cr and Al concentration in autoclave D, which in turn was transferred to autoclave D via the transfer line and subsequently diluted with solvent from the Solvent 2 line. The liquid volume (2.5 litres) in autoclave D was kept constant by continuously removing liquid to CP1, operating   at  a  slightly  reduced  pressure.   This  experimental  set-up  allowed manipulation of the Cr and Al concentrations of each autoclave by varying the solvent feed rates to the respective autoclaves via the pumps (solvent 1 and solvent 2). The Cr and Al concentrations attained in autoclaves C and D are shown in Table 1. The catch pot was sampled every 20 minutes in order to calculate the solids and product make-up of the liquid which in turn was used to calculate the Cr efficiency of autoclave D.

Discussion of Results<br>
The results are shown in Table 1. Examples 1-9 were included to highlight the concept   of    this    invention    using    the    Cr(acac)3/(Ph2P)2N(iPropyl)/MMAO-3A oligomerisation catalyst system. Comparative examples 1 to 6 were activated in the full reaction volume of a 1 liter autoclave. Examples 1 and 2 demonstrate that with an AI:Cr ratio of 479, low solids formation can be achieved with this catalyst system, provided [Al]act, and/or [Al]cat are at least 12 mmol/L. When the catalyst concentration (i.e. both [Al] and [Cr]) is reduced while maintaining AlrCr of 479 (examples 3 and 5) the amount of solids produced increases dramatically. However when [Cr] was reduced, but [AIJ maintained at 12.0 mmol/L (examples 4 and 6), much lower solids formation was observed. From these results it can be seen that within the boundaries of these working examples, the solids formation is not so much a function of low AI:Cr ratio or low [Cr], but is largely a function of low [Al].<br>
Examples 7 and 8 were activated in the presence of an olefin (step A as defined above) with high [Al]act(.&gt; 12 mmol/L) and subsequent catalysis (step C as defined above) was performed at low [Al],^, (z 6 mmol/L), that is after dilution of the activated catalyst. It is clear from these results that low solids formation and good rates may be achieved despite a low [AI]catin step C. In examples 7 and 8, solids of less than 0.5 mass % were achieved with low [Al]cat in step C (6.0 and 2.6 mmol/L respectively) as<br>
a result of activating in the presence of an olefin (step A) with high [Al]act (24 and 12 rnmol/L). The examples at comparable [Al],;a, in step C but low [Al]act, in step A (examples 3 and 5) gave 2.2 and 47.7% solids respectively. Example 9 using the same transfer procedure as examples 7 and 8 in which the [Al]actin step C was increased to 12 mmol/L showed no benefit over example 8 (0.6% solids for example 9 v/s 0.5% for example 8).<br>
Examples  10-24 serve to demonstrate that this concept is applicable to other oligomerisation catalysts based on different ligands, sources of transition metal and activators. Examples 10-13 (conducted with (oethylphenyl)2PN(Me)P(o-ethylphenyl)2 as ligand) were activated in the full liquid volume inside the 450 ml autoclave. Example 10 shows that with an Al: Cr of 960, low solids formation can be achieved with this catalyst, provided [Al]act is at least 24 mmol/L. Examples 11 and 13 show that when the [Al]act is reduced below this value, significant amounts of solids are produced. Examples 11 and 12 , in which the initial Cr charge is reduced from 2.5 to 1.25 pmol, show that high solids formation is not as a result of the lower [Cr] since low solids could be achieved by raising the [Al] from 12 mmol/L to 24 mmol/L. Examples 10 and 11 show that high solids formation is not as a result of AI:Cr since both experiments were carried out at an AI:Cr of 960, and only in the case where the [Al]act was 12 mmol/L, was high solids formation observed. In experiment 14 (also conducted with (oethylphenyl)2PN(Me)P(o-ethylphenyl)2 as ligand), [Al]act was 24 mmol/L and two minutes into the experiment, [Al]cat was reduced to 16.5 mmol/L through the addition of additional methylcyclohexane to the reactor. The rate and solids formation were very comparable to example 10, proving that good rates and low solids can be achieved despite a low [Al]cat.<br>
Comparative examples 15 and 17 (conducted using the CrCI.-,(bis-(2-decylsulfanyl-ethyl))-amine/MAO catalyst system) demonstrate that by reducing the [Aljca. but also<br>
keeping the AI:Cr constant between runs, the amount of solids increases significantly, from 0.7 % to 5.2 %. Comparison of examples 15 and 16 shows that whilst keeping the [Cr] constant, and dropping the [[Al]act between runs, the amount of solids increases. Comparative examples 15-18 clearly show that solids formation is a function of low [Al], lower than 14.8 mmol/L of Al produces solids with this catalyst.<br>
Examples 18 and 19 (also conducted using the (CrCly(bis-(2-decylsulfanyl-ethyl)-amine/MAO catalyst system) where both activated at [[Al]act= 14.8 mmoldm"3. This concentration is not in the region where solids are produced, but for 19, the catalyst is diluted significantly subsequent to catalyst activation, so that the [Al],:at is considerably less than 14.8 mmol/L. In fact 19 yielded the lowest quantity of solids, confirming that low solids formation and good rates may be achieved despite the low [Al]cat if the system is activated at high [Al]act and subsequently diluted in situ.<br>
Examples 20-24 serve to demonstrate that this invention is also applicable to the Cr(2-ethylhexanoate)3/(c5-methoxyphenyl)2PN(lv!e)P(omethoxyphenyl)2-based trimerisation catalyst system.<br>
Examples 1-24 were all batch examples using a variety of oligomerisation catalyst<br>
system. Examples 25-29 demonstrate that this invention is also applicable to<br>
oligomerisation	under	continuous	operation	with	the<br>
Cr(acac)3/(Ph2P)2N(iPropyl)/lv1MAO-3A catalyst system. In comparative examples 25-27, both [Al]actand [Al]act were kept to &gt;12mmol/L All three examples yielded less than 1.3% solids. In comparative example 28, both [Al]act and fAI]cat was maintained at 2.4mmo//L This example yielded 3.2% solids (polymeric product), in example 29, the [Al]act was 19 mmol/L whereafter the catalyst was diluted with solvent so that [Al]act, was 2.4mmoi/L. Catalysis using this configuration yielded only 0.8 mass% solids.<br><br><br><br><br>
