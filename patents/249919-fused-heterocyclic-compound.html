DESCRIPTION<br>
FUSED HETEROCYCLIC COMPOUND<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a fused pyrimidine<br>
compound having a growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase<br>
inhibitory activity, which is useful for the prophylaxis or<br>
treatment of cancer, a production method thereof and use<br>
thereof.<br>
Background Art:<br>
The gene of cell growth factor and growth factor<br>
receptor is called a protooncogene and plays a key role in the<br>
pathology of human tumor. The epithelial cell growth factor<br>
receptor family (erbB) includes EGFR, HER2, HER3 and HER4,<br>
which are type I receptor type tyrosine kinases. These erbB<br>
family express in various cell groups, and are deeply involved<br>
in the control of the growth and differentiation of cells and<br>
the control of suppression of cell death (apoptosis<br>
suppression). For example, high expression of EGFR and HER2,<br>
and homeostatic activation of receptors are empirically known<br>
to transform cells.<br>
It is also known that high expression and simultaneous<br>
expression of each of these receptors are poor prognostic<br>
factors in various cancer patients.<br>
These receptors are bound with many peptide ligands such<br>
as EGF, TGFa and the like, and binding of the ligand promotes<br>
homo- or heterodimerization of the receptors. This induces<br>
increase of kinase activity from self-phosphorylation or<br>
transphosphorylation of the receptors, and causes activation<br>
of downstream signaling pathway (MAPK, Akt) via a protein<br>
bound with a particular phosphorylated tyrosine residue. This<br>
is the mechanism of the receptor activity of the above-<br>
mentioned cell growth, differentiation, cell death suppression<br>
and the like, which is considered to be responsible for the<br>
high expression of receptor in cancer and malignant<br><br>
degeneration of cancer due to topical increase in the ligand<br>
concentration.<br>
Many cancers are associated with the high expression of<br>
EGFR or HER2. For example, breast cancer (20-30%), ovarian<br>
cancer (20-40%), non-small cell lung cancer (30-60%),<br>
colorectal cancer (40-80%), prostate cancer (10-60%), bladder<br>
cancer (30-60%), kidney cancer (20-40%) and the like can be<br>
mentioned. Moreover, receptor expression and prognosis are<br>
correlated, and receptor expression is a poor prognostic<br>
factor in breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer and the<br>
like.<br>
In recent years, clinical use of a humanized anti-HER2<br>
antibody (Trastuzumab) against HER2 highly expressing breast<br>
cancer, clinical trial of anti-EGFR antibody and clinical<br>
trials of several low molecular weight receptor enzyme<br>
inhibitors have demonstrated a potential of these drugs<br>
against HER2 or EGFR for therapeutic drugs for cancer. While<br>
these drugs show a tumor growth inhibitory action in clinical<br>
and non-clinical trials, they are known to induce inhibition<br>
of receptor enzyme activity and suppression of downstream<br>
signaling pathway. Therefore, a compound inhibiting EGFR or<br>
HER2 kinase, or inhibiting activation of EGFR or HER2 kinase<br>
is effective as a therapeutic drug for cancer.<br>
As a compound that inhibits receptor type tyrosine<br>
kinases represented by HER2/EGFR kinase, fused heterocyclic<br>
compounds (e.g., W097/13771, WO98/02437, WO00/44728),<br>
quinazoline derivatives (e.g., WO02/02552, WO01/98277,<br>
WO03/049740, WO03/050108), thienopyrimidine derivatives (e.g.,<br>
WO03/053446), aromatic azole derivatives (e.g., WO98/03648,<br>
WO01/77107, WO03/031442) and the like are known; however,<br>
there is no HER2 kinase inhibitory substance to the present<br>
that has been marketed as a therapeutic drug for cancer.<br>
As to pyrrolo[3,2-d]pyrimidine derivatives, the<br>
following compounds are known as compounds having a cell<br><br>
-tfitory activity (Rhim.-Farm. Zh.. 1982, 16, 1338-<br>
o-lect. Czech. Chem. Commun., 2003, 68, 779-791).<br><br>
As a compound having a receptor type tyrosine kinase<br>
activity, the following pyrrolo[3,2-d]pyrimidine derivative is<br>
known (WO96/40142, W098/23613).<br><br>
Furthermore, as to pyrazolo[4,3-dJpyrimidine derivatives,<br>
3,5,7-trisubstituted pyrazolo[4,3-d]pyrimidine derivatives are<br>
known as compounds having a CDK inhibitory action, a cell<br>
growth inhibitory action and/or an apoptosis inducing action<br>
(EP-A-1348707) , and 3-isopropylpyrazolo[4,3-d]pyrimidine<br>
derivatives are known as compounds having a CDK1/ cyclin B<br>
inhibitory activity (Bioorganic &amp; Medicinal Chemistry Letters,<br>
2003, 13, 2989-2992). Furthermore, synthesis of 3-<br>
methylpyrazolo[4,3-d]pyrimidine derivatives has been reported<br>
(The Journal of Organic Chemistry, 1956, 21, 833-836) .<br>

After washing, the plate was dried at 45°C for 60 min., and 35<br>
uL of MicroScinti 0 (PerkinElmer) was added. The radioactivity<br>
was measured using TopCount (PerkinElmer). HER2 kinase<br><br><br>
inhibitory rate (%) of the test compound was calculated by the<br>
following formula:<br>
Inhibitory rate (%)=(1-(count of test compound -<br>

Experimental Example 3 Inhibitory action on breast cancer cell<br>
BT-474 proliferation in vitro<br>
A suspension of human breast cancer cell BT-474 (100 ul<br>
(6,000 cells)) were sown to a 96-well microplate and cultured<br>
in an incubator (37°C, 5% carbon dioxide) . On the following day,<br>
100 ul of a solution of each test compound, which was<br>
previously diluted 2-fold, was added, and the cells were<br>
cultured for 5 days. After the culture medium containing the<br>
test compound was removed, the cells were washed and fixed witr.<br>
50% trichloroacetic acid, after which a 0.4% (w/v) SRB solutior.<br><br>
(dissolved in 1% acetic acid) was added to fix and stain the<br>
cell protein (Skehan et al., Journal of the National Cancer<br>
Institute, Vol. 82, pp. 1107-1112, 1990). After washing with a<br>
1% acetic acid solution, 100 u.1 of an extract (10 mM Tris<br>
solution) was added to extract the pigment, and absorbance was<br>
measured at an absorption wavelength of 550 nm to quantify the<br>
amount of cells as protein content. Taking as 100% the protein<br>
content for the control group, which received no test compound<br>
solution, the ratio of the residual protein content for each<br>
treatment group was determined, and the compound concentration<br>
required to achieve 50% suppression of the residual cell<br>
content relative to the control (IC50 value) was calculated.<br>
The results are shown in Table 3.<br><br>
