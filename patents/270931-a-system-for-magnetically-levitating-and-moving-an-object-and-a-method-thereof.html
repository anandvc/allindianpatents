				<td>The present invention relates to a system for magnetically levitating and moving an object and a method thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of Invention<br>
The invention relates to apparatus, systems and methods for moving objects. More particularly, the invention relates to levitating, accelerating and decelerating objects with reduced friction and increased efficiency.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
Magnetically   levitated   trains,   conveyor  systems   and   related means of transportation have been attempted many times in the past few decades in an effort to provide more efficient means of transportation for individuals and cargo.  A few examples of such systems can be seen in U.S. Patent No. 4,356,772 to van der Heide; U.S. Patent No. 4,805,761 to Totsch; and U.S. Patent No. 5,601,029 to Geraghty et al.   These systems operate on the general property that magnets having like polarities repel each other, and magnets having opposite polarities attract each other.  Notwithstanding the fact that patent applications have been filed for such systems for decades, a system for moving people and cargo that is viable under real worid conditions has yet to be developed.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed towards apparatus, systems and methods for levitating and accelerating objects. In particular, embodiments of the present invention allow objects to be magnetically levitated and magnetically accelerated with respect to rails, such as train tracks.<br>
In one embodiment, the system incorporates a number of lower rails spaced laterally apart from each other, and an object having a number of<br><br>
upper rails aligned with the lower raiis. The lower rails have permanent magnets abutted one against the next and aligned such that the upper surface of the iower rail has a uniform polarity along its length. The tower rail also has a ferrous backing plate that electroconductively couples the permanent magnets along the length of the track. The upper rails have a number of permanent magnets aligned to oppose the magnets in the lower rails to levitate the object. The upper rails also have a ferrous backing plate eiectroconductiveiy coupling the. permanent magnets.<br>
Another embodiment of the invention comprises a number of first rails, an object to be transferred, a third rail, and a driving-disc.  The first raiis each have a number of permanent magnets aligned near its upper surface. The permanent magnets are oriented to create a uniform polarity along a length of each of the first rails.  The object being transported has second rails that are configured to align with the first rails.    The second rails have permanent magnets mounted thereon that are oriented to oppose the polarity of the magnets in the first rails. Consequently, the object levitates above the first rails. The third rail extends along the length of the first rails.   The third rail is made from an electroconductive material, such as copper or aluminum.   The disc is connected to the object being transported, and rotates with respect to the object.    The disc carries a number of permanent magnets.    The disc is positioned such that the permanent magnets are in close proximity to the third rail during operation.  Rotation of the disc, and more importantly the permanent magnets, in the proximity of the third rail results in eddy currents that accelerate the object along the third rail m a direction opposite the relative rotation of the disc.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE ILLUSTRATED EMBODIMENTS<br>
. The  present detailed description  is  generally directed toward systems, apparatus' and methods for levitating a cart or other object above a<br>
i<br>
track, and for accelerating the object with respect to the track.     Several embodiments of the present invention may allow an individual to levitate an object above a track, and to accelerate and decelerate the object, all without contacting the track.     Accordingly, such embodiments -can  provide highly efficient transportation means for individuals or cargo.  Many specific details of certain embodiments of the invention are set forth in the following description and in Figures 1-17 to provide a thorough understanding of such embodiments. One skilled in the art, however, will understand that the present invention may have additional embodiments or may be practiced without several of the details described in the following description.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates a system 10 for levitating and accelerating objects. The system 10 incorporates a track 12 and a cart 14 configured to move longitudinally in either direction with respect to the track: The track 12 incorporates a pair of supporting rails 16 and a driving rail 18.<br>
In the illustrated embodiment, the supporting rails 16 and the driving rail 18 are supported by a number of footings 20 spaced apart from each other along a length of track 12. The footings 20 are anchored to the ground as generally  understood   in the  art.     The  driving   rail   18  in  the  illustrated embodiment is mounted directly to the footings 20, such as by a flange formed at the lower edge of the driving rail.   The illustrated driving rail 18 is centrally located along the length of each of the footings 20. Depending on the particular design of the cart 14, however, it is envisioned that the driving rail 18 can be positioned at other locations inside, outside, above and- below the supporting rails 16, as would be appreciated by one of ordinary skii! in the relevant art.<br>
in the illustrated embodiment, the supporting rails 16 are coupled to the footings 20 by a number of posts 22 and brackets 24, and extend along opposing ends of the footings. As with the driving rail 18, however, different configurations are possible, as one of ordinary skill in the art would appreciate.<br>
The upper surface of each of the supporting rails 16 carries a number of permanent magnets 26 extending along an operable portion of its length.    In the illustrated embodiment, the permanent magnets 26 in the supporting rails 16 are all of a common length.    The illustrated permanent magnets 26 are butted against each other along the length of the track 12 to provide a magnetic force that is sufficiently constant to enable the cart 14 to move smoothly along the track. The permanent magnets 26 are oriented such that every magnet along the respective supporting rail 16 has its polarity vertically   aligned   with  the   adjacent  permanent   magnets.      The   inventor appreciates that it is not necessary that every permanent magnet 26 be aligned in order for the invention to operate.  The illustrated embodiment, however, is provided as an example of one preferred embodiment.<br>
Figures 2 and 3 best illustrate the cart 14 according to this particular embodiment of the present invention. The cart 14 incorporates a pair of opposing side rails 28 spaced apart to generally align with the supporting rails 16 on the track 12. In the illustrated embodiment, the side rails are made from a ferrous material such as steel. Other materials of like qualities can be substituted for steel.<br>
Attached to the underside of each of the side rails 28 is another set of permanent magnets 30 that align with the permanent magnets 26 on the supporting rails 16 when the cart 14 is engaged with the track 12. In the illustrated embodiment, the permanent magnets 30 in the side rails 28 are all of a common length. The length of each permanent magnet 26 in the supporting rail 16 is different, in this case longer, than the length of the permanent magnet 30 in the side rail 28. One of ordinary skill in the art, after reviewing this disclosure, will immediately appreciate that the difference in length prevents, two. adjacent seams in the support rail permanent magnets 26 from simultaneously<br>
aligning with two adjacent seams in the side rail permanent magnets 30, thus avoiding magnetic cogging.   The permanent magnets 30 on the cart 14 are oriented with their polarities opposite to those of the permanent magnets 26 of the supporting rails 16. As a result, the cart 14 levitates above the track 12.  In the illustrated embodiment, the permanent magnet 30 attached to the side rails 28 are abutted one against the next.   The inventor appreciates, however, that these permanent magnets need not be in contact with each other for the cart 14 to have a smooth ride over the track 12.<br>
The cart 14 has a platform 32 (Figure 2) for carrying individuals or objects. The present invention can be configured for carrying cargo or people and, as a result, the platform 32 can have a wide variety of configurations. For example, platform 32 can be in the shape of a train car or a cargo container. Likewise, the platform 32 and the cart 14 can be sized for carrying only small objects.<br>
The sides of the cart 14 have a number of rollers 36 spaced apart lengthwise along the cart. Rollers 36 are positioned to contact the supporting rails 16 should the cart move out of proper alignment with the track 12. The rollers 36 rotate about vertical axes, and consequently do not significantly affect the movement of the cart 14 along the track 12. It is envisioned by the inventor that a wide variety of means can be substituted for the rollers 36 to keep the cart 14 centered along the track 12.<br>
As illustrated in Figure 3, a battery 38, a motor 40 and a driving disc 42 are housed within this particular cart 14. The illustrated battery 38 is a 12-volt battery similar to one currently used in an automobile. The inventor appreciates, however, that a wide variety of power sources can be substituted for the battery 38, such as a fuel cell.<br>
The motor 40 is coupled to the driving disc 42 by a belt 44. The inventor similarly appreciates, however, that the motor 40.and belt 44 can take other configurations, so long as the driving disc 42 can be controllabiy rotated to accelerate or decelerate the cart 14 with respect to the track 12. An onboard control system 45 (Figure 6) is incorporated to allow a user to controllably<br>
accelerate and decelerate the rotation of the driving disc 42 to control the velocity and acceleration of the cart 14.<br>
Figure 4  illustrates the relative orientation  of the  permanent magnets 30 on the side rails 28 of the cart 14 when engaged with the track 12. As discussed above, the polarity of the permanent magnets 30 is opposite the polarity   of the  permanent  magnets   26.      In  addition,   in  this   particular embodiment, the lateral dimension of the permanent magnets 30 is greater than the lateral dimension of the permanent magnets 26.  The inventor appreciates that these permanent magnets 26, 30 can have the same dimensions, or the permanent magnets 26 could be larger than the permanent magnets 30.   One of ordinary ski!! in the art will appreciate, however, that when the magnets are of the same width, as seen in the prior art, additional lateral support and/or controls   are   necessary to   maintain  optimal   lateral   stability   between  the magnets. On the contrary, in the illustrated embodiment, the magnetic footprint of the upper magnet 30 is wider than that of the lower magnet 26, naturally providing additional lateral stability.<br>
A ferrous backing material 46 is positioned under the permanent magnets 26 in the supporting rail 16. As with the side rails 28, the ferrous backing material 46 can be steel or an equivalent materials. The backing 46 extends along the length of the side rail 16.<br>
As best illustrated in Figure 5, a driving pulley 48 on the motor 40 operates the belt 44 to rotate a driven pulley 50 attached to the driving disc 42. The motor 40 is mounted on a cross-member 52, which is in turn mounted to the cart 14. Similarly, the driving disc 42 is mounted to an underside of the cross-member 52. The driving disc 42 is rotatably mounted on a pair bearings 54 to rotate with respect to the cart 14.<br>
As illustrated in Figure 7, the third rail 18 has a neck 56 and a flange 58. The flange 58 is mounted to the footing 20 to retain the third rail 18 in a fixed alignment with respect to the track 12. The neck 56 is in the form of a fiat plate extending the length of the track 12. The driving disc 42 in. the illustrated embodiment has a pair of magnet rotors 60, spaced one on each<br>
side of the neck 56 of the third rail 18. Each of the magnet rotors 60 has a non-ferrous mounting disc 62 backed by a ferrous backing disc 64, preferably of mild steel.    The mounting discs 62 may be aluminum or a suitable nonmagnetic composite,  and each is fabricated with a number of permanent magnets 66 spaced apart from each other and arranged in a circle abo.ut a shaft 68 carrying the driving disc 42.  Each of the permanent magnets 66 abuts on the outside of the driving disc 42 against the respective backing disc 64. Adjacent permanent magnets 66 may have their polarities reversed.    The permanent magnets 66 are each spaced by an air gap 70 from the neck 56.<br>
The mounting discs 62 are mounted to the shaft 68 to rotate in unison with the shaft. Rotation of the driving disc 42 with respect to the neck 56 results in relative movement between the permanent magnets 66 and the neck in a direction generally tangential to the driving disc.   This tangential direction aligns with the length of the track.    As is generally known in the industry, relative movement between a permanent magnet and an electroconductive material results in an eddy current urging the electroconductive material to follow the permanent magnets.    In the present case, however, because the electroconductive material  in the neck 56  is fixed to the footing  20,  the eiectroconductive material cannot follow the permanent magnets.   Instead, an equal and opposite force is exerted on the cart which carries the permanent magnets 66. This opposing force accelerates the cart in a direction opposite to the movement of the permanent magnets 66. Accordingly, controlled rotation of the driving disc 42 with respect to the neck 56 can accelerate or decelerate the cart 14 with respect to the track 12.<br>
It also understood in the industry that adjustable gap couplings can be used to increase and decrease the resultant forces between the permanent magnets 66 and the neck 56. The inventor incorporates herein by reference U.S. Patent No. 6;005,317; U.S. Patent No. 6,072,258; and U.S. Patent No. 6,242,832 in their entireties to disclose various stmctures that can be used to adjust the spacing between the permanent magnets 66 and the neck<br>
56. Further, the inventor appreciates that a single magnet rotor 62 can be used instead of a pair of magnet rotors.<br>
Embodiments of the present invention have numerous advantages over conveyance systems of the prior art. For example, the aligned polarities in the tracks and the ferrous backing material combine to create a powerful and consistent magnetic force which allows substantial weight to be carried and allows for smooth movement as the weight is transported along the track. Similarly, ferrous backing material incorporated into the side rails of the cart provides like benefits.<br>
In addition, the magnetic driving disc contained on the cart allows for closely controlled, efficient acceleration and deceleration. Because the driving disc does not contact the third rail, there is no wear between the two parts. Further, because the driving disc is contained on the cart, each cart can be independently controlled to accelerate and decelerate along the track.<br>
Figures 9 and 9A illustrate a track 112 and a cart 114 according to another embodiment of the present invention. In general, the cart 114 and track 112 illustrated in Figure 9 operate similar to that described above and illustrated in Figures 1-8. In particular, however, the guidance system and the drive system are both different than those described above. Accordingly, to the extent elements, features and advantages are not discussed below, they can be assumed to be similar to or identical to those described above.<br>
In the illustrated embodiment, 9 drive rail  118 incorporates a flange 158 and a neck 156, similar to those described above.   In addition, a cover plate 157 is positioned over opposing sides of the neck 156 and extends along the length of the drive rail 118.   In this particular embodiment, the neck 156 and flange 158 are manufactured from steel, while the cover plate 157 is manufactured from aluminum.    The inventors appreciate, however, that the cover plate 157 can be made from any other conductive material, the neck 156 . can be made from any other material, preferably a ferrous material such as steel, and the flange 158 can be made from any suitable material.    In the illustrated. embodiment, the aluminum in the cover piate 157 serves as a<br>
conductor for a set of lower magnet rotors 142, and the steel in the neck 156 serves as a ferrous backing plate for each of the opposing cover plates.<br>
As with the above embodiment, the lower magnet rotors 142 are positioned on opposing sides of the drive rail 118, and are operable to accelerate and decelerate the cart 114 with respect to the track 112. In this particular embodiment, however, two pairs of opposing lower magnet rotors 142 are positioned one pair in front of the other along the drive rail 118 (best illustrated in Figure 10). Each pair of lower magnet rotors 142 rotates about a lower shaft 168 to create relative movement between the lower magnet rotor 142 and the drive rail 118 and accelerate or decelerate the cart 114 with respect to the track 112.<br>
As seen in Figure 10, each lower shaft 168 has a sheave 159 fixed thereto to rotate the lower magnet rotor 142 in response to movement of a horizontal belt 161. The horizontal belts 161 are driven by a central pulley 163, which is in turn driven by a vertical belt 165. Unlike the prior embodiment, where the belt is driven directly by the motor 40, the vertical belt 165 in the present embodiment is driven by a pair of upper magnet rotors 167. These upper magnet rotors 167 share an upper shaft 169 and an upper pulley 171, which drives the vertical belt 165.<br>
Rotation of the upper magnet rotors 167 about the upper shaft 169 results in rotation of the upper pulley 171, which in turn drives the vertical belt 165, rotating the central pulley 163. Rotation of the central pulley 163 drives the opposing horizontal belts 161, each of which drives a sheave 159 on one of the pairs of lower shafts 168. Rotation of the lower shaft 168 results in rotation of both pairs of lower magnet rotors 142. As discussed above, rotation of the magnet rotors 142 with respect to the drive rail 118 results in acceleration or deceleration of the cart 114 with respect to the track 112.<br>
The velocity and power of the magnet rotors 167 is adjusted through axial movement of an opposing pair of conductor rotors 173 positioned to face the upper magnet rotors 167 from opposing sides. The conductor rotors 173 and opposing upper magnet rotors 167 function similar to adjustable gap<br>
couplings known in the art. As such, the torque transferred from the conductor rotors 173 to the upper magnet rotors 167 is varied by changing the size of a gap 175 therebetween, in the embodiment illustrated in Figure 9, the gap 175 in the coupling on the left end of the upper shaft 169 is greater than the gap on the right end of the upper shaft. The inventors appreciate that the two couplings cooperate to drive the upper shaft 169, and that the opposing couplings can be adjusted independently or in combination to increase or decrease the torque transferred from the conductor rotors 173 to the upper magnet rotors 167.<br>
The gap 175 is adjusted by moving a motor 140 toward or away from the upper magnet rotor 167. The motor 140 has a drive shaft 177 projecting therefrom that is coupled to the conductor rotor 173. The motor 140 is mounted to the cart 114 at a sliding bushing 179, which moves laterally along an adjustment rod 181. The sliding bushing 179 can be moved back and forth along the adjustment rod 181 by a dual-acting air cylinder 183. The air cylinder 183 moves the sliding bushing 179 along the adjustment rod 181 between a pair of inner stops 185 and a pair of opposing outer stops 187. Because the conductor rotors 173 are mounted on the motors 140, axial movement of the motors results in axial movement of the conductor rotors and, as a result, adjustment of the gap 175.<br>
The motors 140 are operated with an actuator, such as a switch 185 illustrated in Figure 9. The illustrated switch 185 is coupled between a source of electricity, such as a battery 187, and the motors 140, and can be actuated to rotate the motors in either direction to accelerate or decelerate the cart 114 with respect to the track 112.<br>
Figures 11A and 11B illustrate the lower magnet rotors 142 disengaged from the drive rail 118 and engaged with the drive rail, respectively. Each lower magnet rotor 142 is linked to the cart 114 by a swing arm 189 that is pivotally mounted to swing the magnet rotor around a substantially horizontal axis such.that the magnet rotor moves vertically to engage with and disengage from the drive rail 118. A pair of cables 191 are routed from a winch 193 -over<br>
pulleys 195, and are controlled by an actuator 197 to adjust the height of each of the lower magnet rotors 142.<br>
The magnet rotors 142 can be raised or lowered to compensate for the weight of the payload on the cart 114. In particular, with a heavier payload, the cart 114 may ride lower on the track 112 and, to compensate, the magnet rotors 142 could be raised, or vice versa.<br>
Figures 12 and 13 illustrated one particular braking assembly 202 according to an embodiment of the present invention. The braking assembly 202 is illustrated in the disengaged configuration in Figure 12 and in the engaged configuration in Figure 13.<br>
The brake assembly 202 incorporates a pneumatic piston 204, an actuator 206 and a pair of opposing brake levers 208. The pneumatic piston 204 is connected by a pair of pneumatic lines 210 to a control unit 212. The control unit 212 directs pressurized air through the pneumatic lines 210 to or from the pneumatic piston 204 to pressurize an internal chamber therein (not shown) and to move a piston therein (not shown) axially with respect to the pneumatic piston. The actuator 206 is coupled to the internal piston to move with the internal piston as it is controlled by the control unit 212.<br>
The brake levers 208 are coupled to the actuator 206 at a pair of elongated slots 214. When the actuator 206 moves downward, a pin 216 in the brake lever 208 slides inwardly along the slot 214.   As the pin 216 moves inwardly along the slot 214, the brake lever 208 pivots around a pivot point 218 and the brake pads 220 rotate away from the drive rail 118.  Likewise, when the actuator 206 moves upward as viewed in Figure 13, the pins 216 move outward along the slots 214 and the brake levers 208 rotate around the pivot points 218 to compress the brakes against the drive rail 118. Because the brake assembly 202 is rigidly attached to the cart 114, when the brake pads 220 compress against the drive rail 118, the cart can be brought to rest with respect to the track 112.<br>
Figures 14 through 16 illustrate a magnet assembly 300 and -a cart 314 configured with such a magnet assembly to facilitate maneuvering the<br>
cart around tight corners. As best illustrated in Figure 15, the magnet assembly 300 incorporates a permanent magnet 302 housed within a sliding carriage 304 to move laterally within a bracket 306.   The sliding carriage 304 incorporates a body 308 that receives the magnet 303 facing downward and which has a ferrous backing plate 310 positioned above the body 308.    The permanent magnet 302 contacts the ferrous backing plate 310 to increase the effect of the forces exerted by the permanent magnets onto the opposing magnet in the track (not shown).   A pair of arms 312 connect the sliding carriage 304 to a transverse shaft 314. A bushing 316 is configured to allow the sliding carriage 304 to move along the length of the transverse shaft 314.  A pair of rollers 318 are coupled to the sliding carriage 304 by respective mounting rods 320.  The rollers 318  are retained  by compression  bearings 322 to their respective mounting rods 320, which are in turn retained to the sliding carriage 304 by respective nuts 324.   The compression bearings 322 allow the rollers 318 to rotate freely about the mounting rods 320.   A sleeve 326 positioned between the body 308 and the roller 318 maintains a desired spacing between the body and roller.<br>
As  illustrated   in  Figure   16,  the magnet assemblies  300  are mounted by the brackets 306 to longitudinal structural members 328 on the cart 313.  The transverse shafts 314 are oriented substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal structural members 328, such that the magnets assemblies 300 are free to move laterally with respect to the cart. The cart 313 illustrated in Figure 16 is configured for moving around a corner.  As such, the magnet assemblies 300 have moved laterally to conform to the curved shape of the track 330. Because each magnet assembly 300 is free to move independent of the other magnet assemblies, the rollers 318 move each magne^assembly as necessary to conform to the particular track shape.   The magnet assemblies 300 can be biased, such as by springs or other means, to move into a configuration for driving along a straight length, of track.   Likewise, the magnet assemblies 300 can be configured for moving without any restriction.<br><br>
Figure 17 schematically illustrates the cart 313 of this alternative embodiment configured for movement along a straight length of track. The magnets 302 are all aligned with the longitudinal structural members 328 to allow the cart 313 to move along the track in a desired alignment.<br>
The applicant appreciates that many modifications and variations can be made to the embodiments discussed above without diverging from the spirit of the invention.   For example, carts can be fabricated with one, two or more driving discs to independently or collectively accelerate and decelerate the cart in the forward and  reverse directions.     Likewise, more or fewer supporting rails can be incorporated to modify the levitatian forces and weight distribution characteristics of a particular system.    As discussed above, the driving disc and third rail can be positioned in other locations, such as above the cart for "suspended"'configurations.    Other modifications and variations would be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art. Accordingly, the scope of the invention should be interpreted only based on the claims below.<br>
