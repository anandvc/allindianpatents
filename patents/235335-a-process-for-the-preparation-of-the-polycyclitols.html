This invention relates to a process for the preparation of novel polycyclitols. This is a divisional out of Indian Patent Application No. 859/MAS/2000, wherein the novel polycyclitols have been folly described and claimed.<br>
Polycyclitols are a new class of compounds having polycyclic (carbo- and/or hetero¬cyclic) framework and endowed with a dense array of hydroxyl fonctionalities and in some ways mimics naturally occurring cyclitols (hydorxylated biomolecules like inositols, conduritols, carbasugars).<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to novel compounds of the formula 1, their stereoisomers, their derivatives, their analogs. The present invention more particularly relates to novel polycyclitols of the formula 1, their stereoisomers, their derivatives, their analogs.<br><br>
The compounds of the present invention are glycosidase inhibitors, which are used as potential candidates for the treatment of a variety of carbohydrate mediated diseases. For example, the novel polycyclitols of the formula 1 are usefol as antidiabetic, antiviral and anticancer agents.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Several publications recently have reported polyhydroxylated pyrrolizidines, indolizidines and quinolizidine alkaloids having wide ranging biological activities of these compounds, important being anti-viral, anti-cancer and anti-HIV.<br>
Some examples are alexine 2a (Tetrahedron Lett.,29, 2487, 1988), australin 2b {J. Nat. Prod., 51, 1198, 1988), casuarine 3 (Tetrahedron Lett, 35, 7849, 1994), castanospermine 4 (Arch. Biochem. Biophy., 221, 593, 1983 ) and many of their<br><br>
synthetic analogues. Many of these polyhydroxylated compounds have been found to be potent glycomimics. The glycosidase-inhibitory action of these compounds largely depends on the hydroxyl substitution pattern.<br><br>
Recent literature references also report few more examples of polycyclic structures such as the tricyclic conduritol derivative 6 which has been shown to modulate the insulin release from isolated pancreatic islet cells (Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett, 4, 2307-2312, 1994). Balci and co-worker in Tetrahedron Lett., 35, 3349-3352, 1994, have synthesised the conduritol analog 7. The group of Hudlicky have reported in J. Chem. Soc, Perkin Trans. 1, 621-628, 1999, the compounds 8 which have been tested for enzymatic inhibition against some of the common glycosidases.<br><br>
Inhibitors of glycosidases have received considerable focus of attention in the past few decades as they are potential candidates for the treatment of a variety of carbohydrate mediated diseases. Therefore, the development of new glycosidase inhibitors is of considerable interest to synthetic chemists.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is therefore to provide novel polycyclitols of the formula 1 which have very good glycosidase inhibition and have beneficial effects in the treatment of a variety of carbohydrate mediated diseases such as antidiabetic, antiviral and anticancer agents.<br><br>
