				<td>Amine compositions<br>
The invention relates to special amine compositions and a curable mixture containing these special amine compositions, the use of which results in resilient thermosets which have a low degree of crosslinking and are resistant to chemicals, and to the production of shaped articles and coatings using these curable compositions.<br>
Epoxy resins have long been widely used for the production of anticorrosion paints, abrasion coatings, potting compounds and adhesives, which possess outstanding mechanical strength and have good resistance to chemicals. Owing to their high crosslinking density, amine-cured epoxy resins, especially those based on diphenylpropane and epichlorohydrin, are brittle and hard, having glass transition ranges above 20°C.<br>
In practice, great hardness and high strength of amine-cured epoxy resins are not always necessary and at the same time elastification and reduction of brittleness are frequently desired. Particularly for the production of flexibilized shaped articles or of crack-bridging membranes, high flexibility even at relatively low temperatures is required. Various methods, which are not always satisfactory, have been used to date for this purpose.<br>
In principle, the degree of elastification can be increased internally by reducing the crosslinking density^and externally by adding plasticizer.<br>
External elastifying agents are not reactive and are not incorporated into the thermoset network. This method of modification is suitable only for certain applications. They expand the network only by filling space. The external plasticizers include tar, phthalic esters, high-boiling alcohols, glycols, ketone resins, vinyl polymers and similar products which are not reactive with epoxy resins and amine curing agents. The internal elastification of epoxy resins can be achieved by reducing the functionality of the curing agent, as described, for example, in DE-A 2 200 717.<br>
Long-chain, low-functionality aminoamides based on dimericand trimeric fatty acids have been customary for a long time and used in considerable amounts and achieve a satisfactory properly spectrum of soft curing agents for epoxy resins, but, owing to the comparatively high viscosity and low flexibility, cannot be used as universally as would be desirable.<br>
It is also known from DE-A 10 90 803 that such systems can be modified by concomitantly using polyurethanes. This system has been further developed towards elastified plastics by<br>
the process described in DE-A 21 52 606.<br>
DE-C 24 18 041 discloses a process for the production of elastified shaped articles and sheet-like structures, in which the polyetheramines described in DE-C 24 62 791 and comprising urethane groups are concomitantly used as curing agents.<br>
These give thermosets having good elastic properties, but in practice a relatively high viscosity of the curable compositions is found to be troublesome. The deaeration of the curable mixtures is poor at high viscosity and use in self-levelling coatings is scarcely possible.<br>
DE 696 31 314 T2 = EP 0 767 189 B1 describes amine curing compositions for curing coating compositions of epoxy resins, comprising (A) 5-75% by weight of a diamine which has a vapour pressure of less than 133 Pascal at 20°C and which contains both primary and tertiary amine, (B) 25-70% by weight of an amidoamine curing agent and (C) 5-50% by weight of a poly(alkylene oxide)-di- or triamine which has at least three active hydrogen atoms. Cured coatings are, however, comparatively brittle and are therefore not suitable for many applications.<br>
WO 02/44240 A1 describes polyetheramine adducts containing hydroxyl groups. These polyetheramine adducts are obtained by the reaction of a pplyglycidyl ether, prepared from polyalkylene glycol and epichlorohydrin, with an amine which has at least two reactive amine hydrogens per molecule to give a polyetheramine, and subsequent formation of an adduct of this polyetheramine with an epoxide compound which has at least one epoxide group per molecule. These products have high flexibility. The viscosities of the products thus prepared are, however, likewise comparatively high.<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide curing agents and curable compositions which, in addition to high flexibility in combination with sufficient strength,<br>
properties, they can^tsxrbe used for<br>
self-levelling coatings.<br>
It has now been found that this object can be achieved by novel special amine compositions.<br>
The present invention therefore relates to a composition comprising<br>
a) 30 - 70, preferably 40 - 60, % by weight of a polyetherdiamine of the general formula (I)<br>
CH3	CH3<br>
in which n is from 10 to 70, preferably 15 - 40,<br>
3 - 30, preferably 5 - 20, % by weight of a monoamine of the general formula RrNH2, in<br>
which r! is the straight-chain or branched, saturated or preferably unsaturated radical of a<br>
hydrocarbon having 5 to 22 carbon atoms or of a monofunctional polyetheramine having a<br>
molecular weight of up to 400 g/mol and<br>
3 - 30, preferably 5 - 20, % by weight of a di- or triamine and<br>
5 - 40, preferably 10 - 30, % by weight of an alkyphenol of the general formula (II)<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
in which R2 is the straight-chain, branched or cyclic, saturated or unsaturated radical of a hydrocarbon having 5 to 14 carbon atoms.<br>
The polyetherdiamines a) are available under the tradename Jeffamine® from Huntsman. Polyetheramines having an average molecular weight of from 1 000 to 2400 or corresponding to about n = 16 - 40 according to the general formula (I) are preferably used. It is also possible to use blends of polyetheramines having different molecular weights. Polyetheramines having an average molecular weight of from 1500 to 2200 are particularly preferably used, in particular those having an average molecular weight of 2000, corresponding to approximately n = 33.<br>
Unsaturated monoalkylamines having a carbon chain comprising from 8 to 18 carbon atoms are preferably used as monoamine b). Coconut fatty amine (predominantly Ci2-C14) is preferably used.<br>
In principle, all amines which have at least two reactive amine hydrogen atoms can be used as diamines c), for example heterocyclic amines, such as piperazine, N-aminoethyl-piperazine; cycloaliphatic amines, such as isophoronediamine, 1,2-(1,3; 1,4)-diaminocyclo-hexane, tricyclododecanediamine (TCD); araliphatic amines, such as xylylenediamine; aliphatic optionally substituted amines, such as ethylenediamine, propylenediamine, hexamethylenediamine, 2,2,4- or 2,4,4-trirnethylhexamethylenediamine, 2-methylpenta-methylenediamine, ether amines, such as 1,7-diamino-4-oxaheptane, 1,10-diamino-4,7-<br>
dioxadecane, I.U-diamino-^Z.IO-trioxatetradecane, 1,20-diamino-4,17-dioxaeicosaneand 1,12-diamino-4,9-dioxydodecane. Furthermore, polyalkylenepolyamines, such as diethylenetriamine, triethylenetetramine, dipropylenetriamine, tripropylenetetramine and higher molecular weight amines or adducts or condensates comprising free aminehydrogen may furthermore be used.<br>
Aminoethylpiperazine, xylylened famine, isophoronediamine and trimethylhexamethylenediamine are preferably used.<br>
Nonylphenol and/or styrenated phenol, particularly preferably styrenated phenol, are used as alkylphenols d).<br>
The amine compositions thus obtained are comparatively low-viscosity liquids. The amine compositions according to the invention may be used as formulation components for curable compositions - alone or as a mixture with other amine curing agents customary in this area -for epoxy resins for the production of resilient shaped articles, coatings and foams. Surprisingly, it was found that the cured thermosets still have an outstanding elongation at more than 80% even at extreme temperatures of -10°C, the strength values simultaneously also being very high.<br>
The present invention furthermore relates to a curable composition comprising, in addition to the amine compositions according to the invention, an epoxidSiCompound having on average more than one epoxide group in the molecule.<br>
Both the amine compositions according to the invention themselves and the curable compositions have a substantially lower viscosity than the known polyurethanamines and polyetheramine adducts and the curable compositions prepared therefrom. The thermosets obtained using the curable compositions according to the invention are distinguished by outstanding low-temperature flexibility after curing is complete.<br>
customary additives, such as mineral and organic fillers, pigments, plasticizers, accelerators, solvents and other additives, are suitable. For the preparation of foams, the blocking agents customary in this area, in particular the hydrogen-eliminating silane compounds, may be used.<br>
The amine compositions according to the invention can be formulated in a known manner with other formulation components, such as viscosity regulators, accelerators - such as<br>
tertiary amines, triphenyl phosphite or alkylphenols - or with fast curing agents, such as Mannich bases.<br>
The concomitantly used epoxide compounds are curable in the hot and cold state with the curing agents or curing agent mixture according to the invention. They contain on average more than one epoxide group in the molecule and may be glycidyl ethers of monohydric or polyhydric alcohols, such as, for example, glycerol, hydrogenated diphenylolpropane, or of polyhydric phenols, such as, for example, resorcinol, diphenylolpropane or phenol/aldehyde condensates. It is also possible to use the glycidyl esters of polybasic carboxylic acids, such as hexahydrophthalic acid or dimerized fatty acids.<br>
The use of liquid epoxy resins based on epichlorohydrin and diphenylolpropane and/or diphenylmethane, having epoxide values of 0.4 - 0.7 equivalent of epoxide/100 g of resin, is preferred.<br>
Resins which are diluted with reactive diluents and contain, as reactive diluents, for example, monofunctional aliphatic and aromatic glycidyl ethers, such as, for example, butylglycidyl ether or phenylglycidyl ether, or glycidyl esters, such as glycidyl acrylate, or epoxides, such as styrene oxide, or polyfunctional, in particular low molecular weight, di- or triglycidyl ethers are particularly preferred.<br>
The combination of long-chain, weakly crosslinking polyetheramines with highly crosslinking amine formulations makes it possible, in a wide range, to adjust the properties of the reaction resin materials with respect to viscosity, reactivity, etc. and the properties of the thermoset with respect to resilience, crosslinking density, mechanical strength and resistance to chemicals.<br>
The compositions according to the invention can be particularly advantageously used where good adhesion to the substrate, good resistance to chemicals and resilience are required for "Bridging cracks TfilFTe SLiBs(rale"ahd foneliminating internal stress, even at relatively low temperatures.<br>
An important field of use is therefore, for example, the crack-bridging coating of concrete, for example for industrial floors or impermeable safety troughs, for example for heating oil tanks. Owing to their outstanding adhesion to iron and concrete and the adjustable resilience, the compositions according to the invention are furthermore suitable as sealing compounds for joints, adhesives and liquid-tight, crack-bridging membranes. The low-shrinkage and low-<br>
stress curing also permits the production of large mouldings or shaped articles.<br>
The present invention therefore furthermore relates to a process for the production of shaped articles, coatings and foams, characterized in that a curable composition according to the invention is used for the production of the shaped articles.<br>
Starting from the abovementioned binder formulations, it is also possible to produce filled, resilient floor coverings, potting compounds and elastified adhesives and resilient epoxy resin/curing agent foams.<br>

(Table Remove)<br>

temperature 1&gt;    All viscosity data are applicable to 25°C and were measured using the rotational viscometer<br>
Vt 550 from Haake 2)    TP = Graves tear propagation resistance.<br>
Discussion of the results:<br>
As is evident from table 1, the curing agents according to the invention from examples 1 and 6 have a comparative low viscosity of 275 mPa-s and 260 mPa-s respectively. Moreover, the cured thermosets from examples 1 and 6 have, at room temperature (7d), elongation values in combination with comparatively high tensile strength and tear propagation resistance. At -10°C, the examples according to the invention surprisingly still have very high elongation values, whereas the elongation values of the comparative examples have decreased ^ubstantialJy in some nqses. Particularly in comparative example 7 (example 1 fcoitL, DE-A 2 200 717), the elongation values at -10°C decrease particularly sharply. Such a decrease in the elongation values would have been expected even with the curing agents according to the invention, or lower strength values would have been expected in combination with high elongation values. This result was surprising and not foreseeable. The composition according to the invention comprising the polyetherdiamines, monoamines, diamines and alkylphenols described, is, as is evident from the results, very advantageous, as also shown by the further comparative examples. In example 4, the curing agent was<br>
formulated without a proportion of a diamine ortriamine. The product still has not completely cured even after 7 days at room temperature and therefore can scarcely be used industrially. In example 5, once again, a curing agent was formulated with a diamine but without addition of a monoamine. The elongation of the cured thermoset, in particular at -10°C, is comparatively low.<br><br>
