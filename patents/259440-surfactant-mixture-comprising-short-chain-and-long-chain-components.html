Surfactant mixture comprising short-chain and long-chain components<br>
Description<br>
The present invention relates to a surfactant mixture, to formulations comprising such surfactant mixtures, to methods of producing the surfactant mixtures, and to their use.<br>
Surfactants are amphiphilic interface-active compounds which comprise a hydrophobic molecular moiety and also a hydrophilic molecular moiety and, in addition, can have charged or uncharged groups. Surfactants are orientedly adsorbed at interfaces and thereby reduce the interfacial tension so that these can form, in solution, association colloids above the critical micelle-formation concentration, meaning that substances which are per se water-insoluble in aqueous solutions are solubilized.<br>
On account of these properties, surfactants are used, for example, for wetting solids such as fibers or hard surfaces. Here, surfactants are often used in combinations with one another and with further auxiliaries. Typical fields of application are detergents and cleaners for textiles and leather, as formulation of paints and coatings and, for example, in the recovery of petroleum.<br>
Interesting surfactants are in particular those which represent alkoxylation products of alcohols. Here, it has been shown that it is particularly favorable to provide such compounds in various mixtures.<br>
JP-A 2004/091686 describes the mixture of surfactants, where an alkoxylated branched aliphatic alcohol having 8 to 11 carbon atoms is mixed with a further aliphatic alcohol having 12 to 20 carbon atoms, which is likewise alkoxylated.<br>
JP-A 2003/336092 likewise describes polyalkoxylene alkyl ethers which have to satisfy certain conditions.<br>
JP-A 2004/035755 describes a nonionic surface-active composition which has alkyleneoxy adducts of an aliphatic alcohol with a HLB value of from 6 to 14.5,<br><br>
and of an aliphatic alcohol with a HLB value of from 11 to 16.<br>
WO-A 94/11330 describes alkoxylates of 2-propylheptanol and their use for cleaning textile materials.<br>
The same alkoxylates are described in WO-A 94/11331 for degreasing hard surfaces.<br>
Finally, DE-A 19921330 describes the use of branched fatty alcohol ethoxylates having 8 to 22 carbon atoms which can be used as wool detergents.<br>
Despite numerous surfactants which are described in the prior art, there continues to be a need for surfactants or surfactant mixtures which have, at least in part, better properties than those from the prior art. Such properties refer in particular to their wetting behavior, salt tolerance, foam formation, low tendency to form gels, their washing performance and their emulsion stability.<br>
An object of the present invention is therefore to provide a surfactant mixture which, at least in relation to one of the properties listed above, has behavior which is superior to surfactants of the prior art.<br>
The object is achieved by a surfactant mixture comprising<br>
(A)	a short-chain component comprising the alkoxylation product of alkanols, where the alkanols have 8 to 12 carbon atoms and the average number of alkoxy groups per alkanol group in the alkoxylation product assumes a value from 3 to 30 and the alkoxy groups are chosen from the group consisting of ethoxy, propoxy, butoxy and pentoxy groups and the alkanols have an average degree of branching of at least 1; and<br>
(B)	a long-chain component comprising the alkoxylation product of alkanols where the alkanols have 13 to 20 carbon atoms and the average number of alkoxy groups per alkanol group in the alkoxylation product assumes a value from 3 to 30 and the alkoxy groups are chosen from the group consisting of ethoxy, propoxy, butoxy and pentoxy groups and the alkanols have an average degree of branching of from 0.0 to 0.3.<br><br>
The degree of branching of the alkanols (of the alkanol mixture) here is defined as follows:<br>
The degree of branching of an alcohol arises from the branches of the carbon backbone. For each alcohol molecule, it is defined as the number of carbon atoms which are bonded to three further carbon atoms, plus two times the number of carbon atoms which are bonded to four further carbon atoms. The average degree of branching of an alcohol mixture arises from the sum of all degrees of branching of the individual molecules divided by the number of individual molecules. The degree of branching is determined, for example, by means of NMR methods. This can be carried out through analysis of the carbon backbone with suitable coupling methods (COSY, DEPT, INADEQUATE), followed by a quantification via 13C NMR with relaxation reagents. However, other NMR methods or GC-MS methods are also possible.<br>
The average number of alkoxy groups arises from the sum of all alkoxy groups of the individual molecules divided by the number of individual molecules.<br>
Mainly, it has been found that a surfactant mixture, as described in more detail above, of short-chain and long-chain component can have particularly good properties, particularly with regard to the abovementioned properties.<br>
The surfactant mixture according to the present invention comprises a short-chain component (A) which has the alkoxylation product of branched alkanols, where the alkanols have 8 to 12 carbon atoms. More preferably, the alkanols have 9 to 11 carbon atoms, it being particularly preferred if the alkanols have 10 carbon atoms.<br>
The short-chain component (A) of the surfactant mixture according to the invention can also comprise only one such alkanol, but typically a mixture of such alkanols.<br>
If two or more alkanols are used for the short-chain component (A) if the alkanol has 10 carbon atoms, it is preferred that this mixture is a C10 Guerbet alcohol mixture. Here, the main components are 2-propylheptanol and 5-methyl-2-propyl-hexanol. Preferably, the short-chain component (A) consists of at least 90%, preferably 95%, of such a mixture.<br><br>
In addition, it is preferred that thne short-chain component comprises no isodecanol.<br>
The degree of alkoxylation of the alkanol(s) for the short-chain component (A) according to the present invention assumes, on average, values from 3 to 30 alkoxy groups per alkanol.<br>
The alkoxy groups may be ethoxy, propoxy, butoxy and pentoxy groups. It is possible for the alkoxylation to take place in random distribution or blockwise, meaning that correspondingly blockwise groups chosen from ethoxy, propoxy, butoxy and pentoxy groups can arise.<br>
However, it is preferred that the alkoxylation product for the short-chain component (A) has a fraction of ethoxy groups relative to the total number of alkoxy groups which is at least 0.5 for the particular alkoxylation product. More preferably, this is at least 0.75 and it is especially preferred if the alkoxylation product comprises exclusively ethoxy groups as alkoxy groups.<br>
It is preferred if the alkanol mixture of the short-chain component (A) has an average degree of branching of from 1.0 to 2.0. More preferably, the alkanol mixture of the short-chain component (A) has an average degree of branching in the range from 1 to 1.5.<br>
Besides alkoxylation products of branched alkanols which form the short-chain component of the surfactant mixture, it is likewise possible that alkoxylation products of unsaturated aliphatic alcohols are present, where these can have the same number of carbon atoms as the alkanols for the short-chain component (A). However, it is preferred if this group of compounds has a weight fraction, based on the total weight of the surfactant mixture, below 10% by weight, preferably less than 5% by weight.<br>
In addition, the surfactant mixture can have alkoxylation products, where alkanols form these products which do not have the number of carbon atoms stated above. These are in particular alkanols having 1 to 7 carbon atoms, and alkanols having more than 12 carbon atoms. However, it is preferred if this group of compounds has a weight fraction of at most 10% by weight, preferably of less than 5% by<br><br>
weight, based on the total weight of the surfactant mixture.<br>
IVloreover, alkoxylatlon products of branched alkanols can arise which have a lower or higher degree of alkoxylatlon. Mention is to be made here in particular of a degree of alkoxylatlon of 1, 2, and 31 and more alkoxy groups. It is preferred if this group of compounds has less than 30% by weight, preferably less than 15% by weight, based on the total weight of the surfactant mixture. Less than 10% by weight are more preferred, in particular less than 5% by weight.<br>
In addition, the surfactant mixture of the present invention comprises a long-chain component (B) which has the alkoxylatlon product of alkanols which have an average degree of branching of from 0.0 to 0.3 and at least 13 to 20 carbon atoms. Preferably, the alkanol mixture of the long-chain component (B) has 16 to 20 carbon atoms and in particular 16 to 18 carbon atoms.<br>
The long-chain component (B) can also be the alkoxylatlon product of a single alkanol, although this typically has two or more such alkanols.<br>
If mixtures are used, C12-14-coconut fatty alcohols, native alcohols or alkanols obtained from the Ziegler-ALFOL process, for example, are conceivable. Tallow fatty alcohol can likewise be used. This tallow fatty alcohol can be produced, for example, from cotton oil, linseed oil, corn oil, olive oil, peanut oil, rapeseed oil, rice bran oil, dyer's safflower oil, soybean oil, sunflower oil or beef fat, pork fat, poultry fat, fish fat. Preferably, the long-chain component (B) consists of at least 90% by weight, preferably of at least 95% by weight, of such a mixture.<br>
The average degree of alkoxylatlon of the alkanol mixture for the long-chain component (B) according to the present invention assumes values from 3 to 30 alkoxy groups per alkanol.<br>
The alkoxy groups can be ethoxy, propoxy, butoxy and pentoxy groups. It is possible for the alkoxylatlon to take place in random distribution or blockwise, meaning that correspondingly blockwise groups chosen from ethoxy, propoxy, butoxy and pentoxy groups can arise.<br>
However, it is preferred that the alkoxylatlon product for the long-chain component (B) has a fraction of ethoxy groups relative to the total number of alkoxy groups<br><br>
which is at least 0.5 for the particular alkoxylation product. More preferably, this is at least 0.75 and it is particularly preferred if the alkoxylation product comprises exclusively ethoxy groups as alkoxy groups.<br>
The alkanol mixture of the long-chain component (B) has an average degree of branching of from 0.0 to 0.3.<br>
Besides alkoxylation products of such alkanols which form the long-chain component (B) of the surfactant mixture, it is likewise possible that alkoxylation products of unsaturated aliphatic alcohols are present, where these can have the same number of carbon atoms as the alkanols for the long-chain component (B). However, it is preferred if this group of compounds has a weight fraction, based on the total weight of the surfactant mixture, below 30% by weight, preferably less than 15% by weight. More preferably, the fraction is less than 10% by weight. In particular less than 5% by weight.<br>
In addition, the surfactant mixture can have alkoxylation products, where alkanols form these products which do not have the number of carbon atoms stated above. In particular, these are alkanols having 1 to 12 carbon atoms, and alkanols having more than 20 carbon atoms. However, it is preferred if this group of compounds has a weight fraction of at most 10% by weight, preferably at most 5% by weight, based on the total weight of the surfactant mixture.<br>
Moreover, alkoxylation products of alkanols with branching from 0 to 0.3 can arise which have a lower or higher degree of alkoxylation. Here, mention is to be made in particular of a degree of alkoxylation of 1, 2, and 31 and more alkoxy groups. It is preferred if this group of compounds has less than 30% by weight, preferably less than 15% by weight, based on the total weight of the surfactant mixture. More preferably, the fraction is below 10% by weight, in particular below 5% by weight.<br>
Preferably, the ratio of the weight fraction of the short-chain component (A) in the surfactant mixture to the weight fraction of the long-chain component (B) in the surfactant mixture is a value range from 99:1 to 1:99. More preferably, this range is 97:3 to 30:70, in addition more preferably 95:5 to 50:50 and especially preferably 90:10 to 70:30.<br><br>
The respective fraction of components (A) and (B) based on the total fraction of the surfactant mixture is preferably in each case at least 50% by weight, more preferably at least 60% by weight, further more preferably at least 75% by weight, in addition more preferably 90% by weight, based on the total weight of the surfactant mixture.<br>
Preferably, the HLB value according to Griffin is in the range from 10 to 15 for the surfactant mixture according to the present invention.<br>
The surfactant mixture of the present invention comprises components (A) and (B) which each comprise at least one alkoxyiation product of alcohols. The surfactant mixture according to the invention can also still comprise residues of the unreacted alcohols. However, it is preferred if their fraction is less than 15% by weight, particularly preferably less than 10% by weight, based on the total weight of the surfactant mixture.<br>
The alkoxyiation products can be used as they are, or their phosphates, sulfate esters or ether carboxylates (carbonates) are used. These can be neutral or in the form of a salt. Suitable counterions are alkali metal and alkaline earth metal cations or ammonium ions, and also alkyl- and alkanolammonium ions.<br>
The present invention further relates to a formulation comprising a surfactant mixture according to the invention.<br>
The formulation can, for example, comprise 0.01 to 90% by weight of water. Moreover or alternatively, the formulation can have further surfactants or hydrotropes or mixtures thereof. For example, mention may be made here of alcohol alkoxylates of the formula P(0-R-AOn)m-H, where P is a saturated, unsaturated or aromatic carbon backbone to which m alcohol functions are joined which have in turn been etherified with, on average, in each case n alkylene oxide units, n here has a value from 1 to 4 and m a value from 1 to 10. R is an alkylene group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms, Ao is a C2-C5-alkylene oxide. Examples thereof are methylethylene glycols, butylethylene glycols, pentylethylene glycols, hexylethylene glycols, butylpropylene glycols, trimethylolpropane ethoxylates, glycerol ethoxylates, pentaerythritol ethoxylates, ethoxylates and propoxylates of bisphenol A.<br><br>
The present invention further relates to a method of producing a surfactant mixture, comprising the steps:<br>
(a)	alkoxylation of an alkanol mixture, where the mixture has 8 to 12 carbon atoms and the average number of alkoxy groups per alkanol group in the alkoxylation product assumes a value from 3 to 30 and the alkoxy groups are chosen from the group consisting of ethoxy, propoxy, butoxy and pentoxy groups and the alkanol mixture has an average degree of branching of at least 1, preferably 1.0 to 2, more preferably 1.0 to 1.5;<br>
(b)	alkoxylation of an alkanol mixture, where the alkanol mixture has 13 to 20 hydrocarbon atoms and the average number of alkoxy groups per alkanol group in the alkoxylation product assumes a value from 3 to 30 and the alkoxylation groups are chosen from the group consisting of ethoxy, propoxy, butoxy and pentoxy groups and the alkanol mixture has an average degree of branching of from 0.0 to 0.3; and<br>
(c)	mixing the alkoxylation products obtained in step (a) and (b).<br>
Besides the method described above for producing a surfactant mixture, the corresponding alkanols for the short-chain component (A) and long-chain component (B) can also be mixed before the alkoxylation and then the mixture can subsequently be subjected to an alkoxylation.<br>
Consequently, the present invention further relates to a method of producing a surfactant mixture according to the present invention, comprising the steps<br>
(a)	mixing a first alkanol mixture which has 8 to 12 carbon atoms and an average degree of branching of at least 1 with at least one second alkanol mixture which has 13 to 20 carbon atoms and an average degree of branching of from 0.0 to 0.3; and .<br>
(b)	alkoxylation of the mixture of the first and second mixture from step (a), where the number of alkoxy groups per alkanol group in the alkoxylation product assumes an average value of from 3 to 30 and the alkoxy group is chosen from the group consisting of ethoxy, propoxy, butoxy and pentoxy groups.<br><br>

Examples<br>
Example 1 "Surfactant 1"<br>
A mixture of 2-propylheptanol and 5-methyl-2-propylhexanol, which is sold as<br><br>
technical-grade 2-propylheptanol (2-PH) by BASF, as short-chain component (A) (average degree of branching of 1.15) and tallow fatty alcohol (Ci6-Ci8-alcohol) as long-chain component (B) (average degree of branching of approximately 0) are mixed in various mass ratios (A:B = 2-PH: Cie-Cis-alcohol) and then ethoxylated by means of KOH catalysis, with various HLB values according to Griffin (20 times the mass fraction of ethylene oxide in the product) being established.<br>
Comparative example 2 (= "Surfactant 2")<br>
A mixture of isodecanol (Exxal ION, Exxon) (average degree of branching of 2.2) and C13-C15-OXO alcohol (average degree of branching of 0.6) (C13-C15 alcohol, BASF) is reacted analogously to example 1 with ethylene oxide to give "surfactant 2". The mass ratio A:B refers here to the ratio of isodecanol to C13-C15-OXO alcohol.<br>
TESTS<br>
1)        Wetting of cotton according to EN 1772<br>
The tables below show the wetting times (according to EN 1772, 2 g/l soda) of the surfactant mixture according to the invention ("surfactant 1") and of the reference mixture ("surfactant 2")<br><br><br><br>
Summary:<br>
It is clear to see that the wetting power of surfactant 1 is better than that of<br>
surfactant 2, particularly at higher dilutions.<br>
2)        Stability against lyotropic salts (example NaOH)<br>
2% surfactant mixture is mixed with aqueous NaOH solutions (0%, 1 %, 2%, 3% etc.), and after storage for 24 h at 23°C, it is tested whether the mixture is stable (clear or cloudy) or whether phase separation or creaming has taken place. The highest concentration of NaOH at which the formulation appears still optically one-phase (clear or cloudy) after 24 h at 23°C is given.<br><br><br>
Surfactant 1 is combined witli water and homogenized well. the mixture is then left to rest for 24 h at 23°C. Then, a Brookfield rheometer (spindle 2-7, 60 rpm, 23°C) is used to determine the viscosity of the mixture.<br><br>
The emulsion stability is determined by means of the marker method, as described in DE 10247086. In two 600 ml beakers, 1% by weight of surfactant is mixed with 69% by weight of water and then 30% by weight of oil - dyed yellow or blue - are added. Then, using a propeller stirrer for 15 minutes, an input of about 10 kW/m is introduced. The emulsions obtained are mixed, and the droplet size distribution is measured by means of statistical laser scattering. The following tables give the dso, the median of the droplets.<br>
The emulsions are then stored at 23°C. At periodic intervals, the emulsions are shaken, a sample is taken and the fraction of green drops, formed by coalescence, is determined by means of microscopy and electronic image analysis. The measured green fractions are then plotted against the storage time and fitted by the following function by the least squares method:<br>
Green(t) = 100% $ (1-exp(-a$t)).<br>
The stability constant S is finally obtained from S = -log(a $ month).<br><br><br>
Summary: In the case of paraffin oil, significantly smaller emulsion droplets are found with surfactant 1 compared to surfactant 2 for approximately identical emulsion stability. In the case of sunflower oil, a drastically improved emulsion stability is found with surfactant 1 compared to surfactant 2.<br><br>
5)        Determination of the detergency during high-temperature cotton washing<br>
About 10 g of WFK soiled fabric 10D are rolled up and placed into a small laundry basket for a washing machine Ahiba Texomat. 200 ml of a wash liquor of softened water and 1 g/l of the respective surfactant are poured into the glass container and brought to 60°C In the dyeing and washing apparatus. The device is started and heated from 60°C to 95°C in 15 min, at 95°C, the temperature is held for 15 min. The soiled fabric is then removed, and rinsed twice hot and once cold. The fabric is squeezed, dried and mangled while hot. The degree of whiteness on the soiled side of the fabric is assessed in Berger units on a suitable spectrometer (Datacolor-spectrometer Spectraflash 500).<br><br>
wfk 10 D    Skin grease/pigment on cotton<br>
wfk 20 D    Skin grease/pigment on 65% polyester/35% cotton<br>
wfk 10 PF   Plant grease/pigment on cotton<br><br><br>
After rinsing, spinning was carried out and the fabric was hung up to dry individually. The fabric was measured using an EIrepho 2000 from Data Color, Heidenheim, 6 measurement points per Item of fabric. The reflectance value was determined at 460 nm. Large values for the reflectance here indicate good soil release and high primary detergency.<br>
The washed test fabrics are measured using a photometer from Data Color (EIrepho 2000). The table below gives the reflectance value (R at 460 nm) in percent. The higher the reflectance value, the better the primary detergency.<br>
For each run, a formulation comprising Lutensol A07 as surfactant ("Lutensol A07"), and a formulation In which the surfactant was replaced by water ("without surfactant") were also washed as control experiments. These experiments serve to standardize the washing results. Standardization was carried out linearly, with "without surfactant" being set at 0% and "Lutensol A07" being set as 100%:<br>
Calculation formula:<br>
% {Detergency) = 100% • [reflectance (surfactant 1 or 2) - reflectance ("without surfactant")]/[reflectance ("Lutensol A07") - reflectance ("without surfactant")]<br><br><br><br><br><br>
