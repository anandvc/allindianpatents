(b)NATIONALITY: Indian Company incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956<br>
(c) ADDRESS: Indoco House, 166 C.S.T. Road, Santacruz (East), Mumbai - 400 098, Maharashtra, India.<br>
3.PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION:<br>
The following specification describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed-<br>
 <br>
FIELD OF INVENTION:<br>
The present invention provides a process for the preparation of 4-amino-l -isobutyl-H-imidazo[4,5-c]quinoline of Formula I.<br>
 <br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART:<br>
The compound 4-amino-l-isobutyI-lH-imidazo[4,5-c]quinoline of Formula I commonly known as Imiquimod is an immune response modifier indicated for the treatment of actinic keratosis, superficial basa! cell carcinoma, and external genital warts.<br>
The synthesis of imiquimod was described in U.S. patent No. 4,689,348, wherein the compound l-isobutyl-lH-imidazo[4,5-c]quinoline of Formula 11 is subjected to oxidation using hydrogen peroxide in acetic acid or peracids to get the compound 1-isobutyl-lH-imidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-5-oxide of Formula III. After recrystallisation the compound of Formula III is heated with phosphorous oxychloride, which after work up and recrystallisation yields the compound 4-chloro-l-isobutyl-lH-imidazo[4,5-c]quinoline of Formula IV. The compound of Formula IV on reaction with ammonium hydroxide in an autoclave at 150°C for 16 hrs results in the compound 4-amino-l-isobutyl-1H-imidazo[4,5-c]quinoline of Formula I. The reaction sequence is as shown in scheme 1 below.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
Scheme 1 The disadvantage of the above prior art are;<br>
i.    use of hazardous, explosive and environment unfriendly reagents, hydrogen<br>
peroxide for oxidation and phosphorous oxychloride for chlorination;<br>
ii.   longer duration of reaction ;<br>
iii. use of autoclave at high temperature which is unsafe on industrial scale.<br>
Other reagents disclosed in the prior art for the oxidation of the compound 1-isobutyl-lH-imidazo[4,5-c]quinoLine of Formula II to get the compound l-isobutyl-lH-imidazo[4,5-c] quinoIin-5-oxide of Formula III are peracetic acid and meta-chloroperbenzoic acid in various solvents. The reagents used for oxidation are hygroscopic and unstable which is undesired for use on industrial scale.<br>
The US patent No. 5,175,296 describes a process, wherein the compound 1-isobutyl-lH-imidazo[4,5-c] quinolin-5-oxide of Formula III is reacted with benzoyl isocyanate to get the compound N-benzoyl-l-(2-methylpropyI)-IH-imidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-4-amine of Formula V which on hydrolysis with sodium methoxide results in the compound 4-amino-l-isobutyl-lH-imidazo[4,5-c]quinoline of Formula I. The reaction sequence can be represented as in scheme 2 below;<br>
 <br>
 <br>
Scheme 2<br>
The drawback of the process is increased number of steps and use of industrially toxic and unsafe reagent.<br>
WO2004/009593 disclose a process wherein the compound l-isobutyl-lH-imidazo[4,5-c] quinolin-5-oxide of Formula III is reacted with phthalimide in presence of benzoyl chloride and tri-n-butylamine to get l-isobutyl-lH-imidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-4-phthalimide of Formula VI. The compound of Formula VI is reacted with hydrazine hydrate in presence of antifoaming agent isooctyl alcohol to get imiquimod of Formula I.<br>
Another application WO2008/048683 describes the process for preparing imiquimod, wherein the compound l-isobutyl-177-imidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-5-oxide of Formula III is reacted with phthalimide in presence of benzoyl chloride and tributylamine to get l-isobutyl-lH-imidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-4-phthalimide of Formula VI. The compound of Formula VI is reacted with ethylenediamine at 70°C yields imiquimod of Formula I. The reaction sequence of above prior arts can be represented as in scheme 3 below;<br>
 <br>
 <br>
The drawbacks of the above prior arts are;<br>
i.   the intermediate phthalimido compound needs treatment with methanol to get pure<br>
compound; ii.   foaming during the breaking of phthalimido group to get amino group at C4<br>
position. iii. increased number of steps and processing time to get the compound.<br>
Another application WO 2006/070379 discloses a process for preparing imiquimod, wherein the compound l-isobutyI-lH-imidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-5-oxide of Formula III is reacted with phosphorous oxychloride at heating to get 4-chloro-l-isobutyI-l//-imidazo[4,5-c]quinoline of Formula IV. The compound of Formula IV is reacted with sodium iodide in acetone to get 4-iodo-l-isobutyl-1Himidazo[4,5-c]quinoline of Formula VII which is then reacted with methanolic ammonia at 150 - 155°C in an autoclave to isolate crude imiquimod of Formula I. The crude compound is purified by acid base method to get pure imiquimod. The disadvantages of the process are;<br>
i.    increased number of steps which affects the economy of the process;<br>
ii.   uses autoclave and higher temperature reaction to get the final compound.<br>
It therefore remains a need to develop an alternative and improved process for the preparation of imiquimod which overcomes the problems associated with the processes known in the art.<br>
The present inventors ameliorates the problems of the prior art processes by using cost effective and safe reagent for oxidation, avoiding the recrystallisation of intermediate, use of autoclave and reducing the number of steps to prepare 4-amino-l-isobutyI-l//-imidazo[4,5-c]quinoline of Formula -1.<br>
OBJECTIVE OF THE INVENTION:<br>

 <br>
range of 20°C to 60°C. The preferred temperature for oxidation reaction is 25 - 50°C, wherein the most preferred temperature for the reaction is 45 - 50°C<br>
The oxidizing agent potassium peroxymonosulfate is a non-inflammable, non-hazardous stable solid compound which is safe to handle on the industrial scale.<br>

Combined filtrate and washing cooled gradually to 25 - 30°C and adjusted the pH 9-10 of the solution with aqueous ammonia maintaining temperature at 25 - 30°C. Stirred the reaction mass for 2 hours. Filtered the solid and washed the product with methanol (160 ml) followed by water (2 x 160ml). Dried the isolated pure 4-amino-l-isobutyl-lH-imidazo[4,5-c]quinoline [Imiquimod] under vacuum at 45 - 50°C till constant weight. Yield-42 gm; % Yield = 52.7%; HPLC purity = NLT 99.5%.<br>
