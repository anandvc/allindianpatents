The invention relates to a deflection yoke for a colour cathode-ray   tube.<br>
A deflection yoke includes a pair of vertical deflection coils, a pair of horizontal deflection coils in the form of a saddle and a ring of ferromagnetic material surrounding the deflection coils so as to concentrate the deflection fields in the appropriate region.     A cathode-ray  tube  intended  to  generate  colour  images  generally includes an electron gun emitting three coplanar electron beams, each beam being intended to excite a phosphor of a defined primary colour (red, green or blue) on the screen of the tube.<br>
The electron beams scan the screen of the tube under the influence of the deflection fields created by the horizontal and vertical deflection coils of the deflection yoke fixed to the neck of the tube.<br>
The three beams generated by the electron gun must always converge on the screen of the tube, otherwise a so-called convergence error is introduced which falsifies, in particular,  the rendition of the colours. In order to make the three copianar beams converge, it is known to use so-called self-converging astigmatic deflection fields; in a self-converging deflection coil, the intensity of the field or the lines of flux which are caused by the horizontal deflection winding are generally in the form of a pin-cushion in the region of a portion of the coil which is located somewhat to the front of the latter on the side facing the screen of the tube.<br>
Moreover, under the action of uniform horizontal and vertical deflection fields, the volume scanned by the electron beams is<br><br>
2 <br>
a pyramid whose apex is coincident with  the centre of deflection of<br>
the  deflection  yoke  and  whose  intersection  with  a  non-spherical<br>
screen  surface  exhibits   a  geometrical  defect  called  pin-cushion<br>
distortion.  This  geometrical  distortion  of the  image  increases  as   the<br>
radius  of curvature of the screen of the  tube  increases.<br>
Self-converging   deflection   yokes   generate   astigmatic deflection  fields  which make it possible  to  modify  the  North/South and  East/West  geometry of the  image  and,  in particular,  partially correct   for   the   North/South  pin-cushion  distortion.<br>
The correction of both the convergence of the electron beams and the North/South geometry of the image on the screen, by means of a particular configuration of the  conductors  making  up  the deflection  coils,  has  been difficult to  achieve  without additional components, such as metal pieces or permanent magnets.    The additional components are placed so as to cause local modification of the  deflection  fields.  These  additional  components  may  be  expensive and may lead to overheating problems associated with the operating frequency, particularly when they  are used to modify the horizontal deflection field, since the current trend is towards increasing the said frequency  up  to  32 kHz  or  even  64 kHz.<br>
Moreover,   these   image-geometry   and   convergence problems are associated with the planarity of the screen and increase with the radius of curvature of the said screen. Conventional cathode-ray tubes manufactured a few years ago, using a screen of spherical shape,  generally have a radius of curvature R. When the screen has a relatively large radius of curvature, greater than 1R, such as  1.5R or more for example, it becomes increasingly difficult to fix the problems mentioned above merely by means of suitable fields generated by the deflection coils.<br><br>
3	<br>
Published   European   Patent   Application   EP 701.267	<br>
discloses  a means of controlling  the  North/South  geometry of The<br>
image created by the deflection yoke on the screen surface,  as well as<br>
the convergence  of the beams,  using  a ring or core of ferromagnetic<br>
material  to concentrate  the deflection  fields.     Part of the core, closest<br>
to the screen of the tube,  is arranged in such a way that the regions<br>
closest to  the  vertical  axis  of symmetry  have  a  magnetic  reluctance<br>
greater than  the regions closest to the horizontal  axis of symmetry.<br>
However,  this arrangement may require the use of an additional  field<br>
shaper for local correction of the defects.<br>
It may be desirable to employ in a deflection yoke for a colour cathode-ray tube a magnetic core having a geometry of which makes  it possible  to  correct both  convergence  and  geometrical  errors without  using  additional  field  shapers.<br>
In accordance with an inventive feature, a deflection yoke includes a pair of horizontal deflection coils and a pair of vertical deflection coils.     An approximately frustoconical  ferromagnetic core  is placed, at least partly, over the deflection coils.      The core has a vertical plane of symmetry, YZ, and a horizontal plane of symmetry, XZ.    The magnetic reluctance of the core, in its front part, in the vicinity of the horizontal plane of symmetry, is greater than in the vicinity of the vertical plane of symmetry.<br>
IN THE  accompanyimg DRAWINGS:	<br>

Figure 2 shows a ring or core made of ferromagnetic material  according to the prior art;<br><br>

Figure  3   shows  another embodiment of a  ferromagnetic<br>
ring according  to the prior art;<br>
Figure 4 illustrates  a perspective  view  of a ring according to  the  invention;  and<br>
Figure 5  illustrates a perspective view of a ring according to  another  embodiment of the  invention.<br>
As illustrated in Figure  1, a self-converging colour display device comprises  a cathode-ray tube (CRT) 50 provided with an evacuated  glass  envelope 6  and an array of phosphor elements representing three colours arranged at one of the ends of the envelope forming a display screen 9. A set of three in-line of electron guns 7 is arranged at a second end of the envelope   The set of electron guns is arranged so as to produce three electron beams  12 which are aligned horizontally so as to excite the corresponding various colour phosphor elements. The electron beams scan the entire surface of the screen by means of a deflection yoke 1, placed on a neck 8 of CRT 50. Yoke 1  includes a pair of horizontal deflection coils 3, a pair of vertical deflection coils 4, separated from each other by a separator 2 and a ferromagnetic core  10 intended to concentrate the field where it is intended to act.<br>
A conventional deflection yoke for a CRT, of the self-converging type, causes the electron beams to converge onto a screen panel of the CRT by virtue of a non-uniform magnetic deflection fields.    In the deflection yoke, the horizontal deflection field has a pin-cushion-shaped  intensity  distribution   and   the   vertical   deflection field  has  a barrel-shaped intensity  distribution.     The  intensity distribution of the horizontal field provides a partial correction of the North/South  geometrical distortion of the image.  However,  this  nonuniform field may cause a so-called gull-wing distortion of the<br><br>
5 <br>
horizontal edges of the image on the screen. This distortion is due to<br>
the   fifth-order  and   higher-order  harmonic   components   of  the   series decomposition  of the deflection  field.<br>
A deflection  yoke  according  to  the prior art incorporates  a core or ring of ferromagnetic material,  as illustrated in Figure 2. This ring is generally symmetric with respect to an axis Z and has a rear part  13 of internal diameter d. It has a flared part 12 which terminates  in  a  front surface   11   contained in  a plane perpendicular  to axis Z. The internal diameter of the front part is D. The thickness "e" of the ring, measured in a section perpendicular to its  surface,  is approximately   constant.<br>
According to one prior art, illustrated in Figure 3, the ring or core may have in its front part recesses   14 which are arranged symmetrically with respect to the XZ plane and lie in the vicinity of the intersection with the YZ plane. These recesses locally alter the magnetic reluctance of the ring and alter the distribution of the lines of force of the deflection fields. This arrangement may improve the North/South geometry of the image as  well as minimize  the  gull-wing distortions. It also may improve the situation with regard to the convergence of the electron beams along the X and Y axes of the screen.  However,  the convergence  situation in intermediate positions may be highly degraded,  in particular in the corners of the image.<br>
According to a feature of the invention, a ring or core 20 of Figure 4, for example, of ferromagnetic material, is used for concentrating the electron-beam deflection fields.    Core 20 is placed, at least partly, above the deflection coils. Core 20 has a vertical plane of symmetry, YZ, and a horizontal plane of symmetry, XZ.    The magnetic reluctance is, in the front region of core 20, in a vicinity of the intersection with the horizontal plane of symmetry, XZ,    is greater<br><br>
6 <br>
than in the region of core 20 located in the vicinity of the intersection<br>
with the vertical plane of symmetry, YZ.    A region located in the<br>
vicinity of the  intersection with  a given plane of symmetry,  horizontal<br>
or vertical,    is defined as a region bounded by a radial aperture angle<br>
of 45° on either side of the the given plane of symmetry.    Core 20<br>
may be used in an arrangement similar to that of Figure  1, instead of<br>
core 10.    The front region of core 20 of Figure 4 is located close to the<br>
screen end of CRT 50.<br>
According  to  the embodiment of the invention,  illustrated in Figure 4, ring or core 20 is made from a body having approximately constant or even thickness "e"  and has  an approximately frustoconical shape.    Core 20 has a front part 21  of internal diameter D, a rear part 23 of internal diameter d and a flared part 22. A pair of cuts, lying symmetrically with respect to the YZ plane, are formed in the front of the ring, at the intersection with the XZ plane, in order to create a pair of semicircular recesses 24.<br>
A cutting planes 25 may be chosen preferably parallel to the Z axis. In this way, the thickness of ring 20 around the intersection of the front part of the ring with the XZ plane varies gradually from  the aforementioned value  "e"  to zero,  thereby  enabling the value of the reluctance in the region of the recesses 24 to be gradually increased.  This gradual change may be preferable, for improving both  the convergence  and geometrical parameters,  to  an abrupt change from a thickness equal to "e" to a zero thickness.    In contrast to the gradual change, an abrupt change would result from a recess  cut-out whose side walls is contained in planes perpendicular to axis Z. Moreover, this gradual change may be altered as required, depending on the desirable extent of correction to be made.    In order<br><br>
7<br>
 to accomplish this, the cutting plane may be modified so as to make a<br>
non-zero angle with the Z axis.<br>
Tables   1   and  2  below  show  the  measured  results  obtained from a deflection yoke of the saddle/saddle type for a CRT of the A68SF type having a screen with a diagonal of 68 cm and a radius of curvature  greater than   1.5R.    The deflection yoke  includes  ring or core 20 of Figure 4 made of ferromagnetic material which extends in the direction of the Z axis over a length of 50 mm.    Core 20 has a flared part 22  which  is  38 mm  in  length,  a rear diameter "d"  of 50 mm  and      a  front diameter D of  105 mm.<br>
Table   1  gives the results of measurements of the geometrical   and  convergence  parameters  in  the  following  three successive   situations:<br>
1.	A situation referred to in Table  1 as "the initial situation", in which a prior art ring of Figure 2 does not have a recess at the front and its thickness "e" is approximately constant;<br>
2.	A situation in which the ring or core 20 of Figure 4, according to the invention, has, at the front, recesses having a maximum depth  P equal  to  13 mm at the  intersection with  the<br>
     horizontal plane XZ; and<br>
3.	A situation in which the prior art core of Figure 3 has,<br>
at the front, the same recesses but these lie at the intersection with<br>
the vertical plane YZ.<br>
The  measured  parameters  are  given  as  percentage  errors,      The errors in  the  North/South geometry,  are measured  at the extreme horizontal edges of the image (ext.  N/S) and half-way between the centre of the image and the extreme edges (int. N/S).    The errors in gull-wing distortion are measured at four points in one quadrant of the   screen:<br><br>
8<br>
-	on the horizontal external edge of the image:<br>
at  1/3 from the Y axis, 2/3 from the corner (1/4 ext.<br>
GW)<br>
at 2/3 from the Y axis,  1/3 from the corner (1/8 ext.<br>
GW); and<br>
-	along the horizontal line lying half-way between the X<br>
axis and the upper edge of the image on the screen:<br>
at  1/3 from the Y axis, 2/3 from the vertical edge<br>
(1/4 int. GW)<br>
at 2/3 from the Y axis,  1/3 from the vertical edge of<br>
the image (1/4 int. GW). The horizontal convergence errors are measured on the edges of the image at 6 o'clock/12 o'clock (6-12 OC), at 3 o'clock/9 o'clock (3-9 OC), along the direction of the diagonal (corner OC) and along the direction between the diagonal and 6 o'clock/12 o'clock (1/2H OC).<br><br>

The results of these measurements show that the configuration according to the invention leads to an improved overall situation with respect to the configuration described in European Application   EP 701,267.<br>
Although the convergence situation is improved, both in the configuration suggested by the prior art and according to the invention, the results show that the configuration according to the prior art significantly degrades  the convergence situation in the corners and between the corners and 6 o'clock/12 o'clock. In particular, the fact of having (6-12 OC), (3-9 OC) and (corner OC), (1/2 H OC)  convergence errors of opposite sign means  that it might not be impossible to bring these errors to acceptable values by<br><br>
10 <br>
altering the windings of the deflection coils.    In this case it may be<br>
necessary  to  use  additional  field  shapers  in  order  to  correct  these<br>
errors.<br>
On the other hand, in the case of the invention, Table  1  shows<br>
an  improvement  in  the  geometrical  error.     Ideally,   the  geometrical<br>
error should be  brought close  to  -1%,  corresponding  to  viewing<br>
without any  apparent defect at a distance  from the  screen equal  to  5,<br>
times the height of the image.    Also an improvement in the gull wing<br>
is obtained.    The convergence  situation can be optimized by simple<br>
and  known  alterations  of the deflection coils  since  the  measured<br>
convergence errors  are all of the same  sign.<br>
According  to  another  embodiment  of the  invention, illustrated in Figure  5, recesses  are arranged not only  at the intersection of the front of the ring with the XZ plane but also at the intersection with the YZ plane.    In this case, the results obtained with regard  to  the  convergence  and  geometrical  parameters  are  given  in Table 2. The initial situation, in which the deflection yoke is equipped with  a  ring  having  approximately  constant  thickness  and  the  front part of which has a uniform reluctance, is compared with the same deflection yoke whose  ferromagnetic ring has, in its  front part, recesses 24 of depth Px and 24' of depth Py.<br>
It can be seen from the Table 2 that the most favourable configuration is that in which Px is greater than Py.  Such favorable configuration which causes  the magnetic reluctance of the ring  to remain, in its front part lying in a region in the vicinity of the intersection  with  the  horizontal  plane  of symmetry,  greater  than  in the part lying in  the vicinity of the intersection with the vertical plane of symmetry. In this case, all the convergence and geometrical parameters are improved.    On the other hand, the case in which Py is<br><br>
11<br>
greater than Px results in at least one of the four 6-12 OC, 3-9 OC and corner OC,   1/2 H OC convergence errors  being of opposite  sign with respect to at least one of the other three.    The opposite sign situation,  disadvantageously,  may  not  be  possible  to  correct  without an  additional  field  shaper.<br>

In  another embodiment,   shown partially by  a  broken  line in Figure 4, a magnetic reluctance is obtained according to the invention, at the front of the ferromagnetic ring, not by creating recesses, but by locally altering the thickness of the ring by obtaining a thickness e'. Thus, by having a smaller thickness at the intersection of the front part of the ring with the horizontal plane XZ than at the<br><br>
12<br>
 intersection of the front part with the vertical plane YZ, it is possible<br>
to  obtain   the  reluctance  characteristics  according  to  the  invention.<br>
The invention is not limited to deflection devices  for<br>
colour cathode-ray  tubes;  its  action on  the  geometry of the  image<br>
allows  the incorporation of a ring of ferromagnetic  material  according<br>
to  the invention  in a deflection yoke  intended to  equip  a  monochrome<br>
cathode-ray   tube.<br><br>
