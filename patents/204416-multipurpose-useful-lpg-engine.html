This invention relates to Multi Purpose Useful LPG Engine<br>
Field of Invention:<br>
This invention relates to a Gas (LRG., C.N.G., N.G., LN.G. Gobar Gas, Bio Gas, Wonder Gas) based Agricultural &amp; Aqua Culture Engine. Specifically this invention relates to Mechanical driven water lifting &amp; Power Generating &amp; Aerator purpose in Agri &amp; Aqua Culture. This device is useful for pumping water from Borewells. Ponds, open wells, rivers and the like water sources. Thus enabling the poor farmers for pumping water for irrigation &amp; Aerators in Aqua Culture.<br>
Prior Art:<br>
Gasoline (Petrol) The working of four stroke gasoline engine which is used in cars &amp; agricultural purpose. The four strokes are in take stroke, compression stroke, power stroke, exhaust stroke. The energy cycle of engine begins in take stroke, as the piston moves down the silinder and draws in a fuel mixture. Next the pistion compresses the mixture while moving up the piston (cylinder). At the top of the compression stroke, the spark plug ignites the fuel. Burning gasses push the piston down for the power stroke. The piston the moves up the cylinger again. Pushing the burned gasses out during the exhaust stroke. This type of engines have carburator.<br>
Diesel Engine:<br>
The working of the four stroke internal combustion engine. A cycle begins with the intake stroke when the piston moves down and draws air into the cylinder. The piston rises and compresses the air during the compression stroke. The air temperature rises to 480CÂ° when diesel is injected into the cylinder, It mixes with hot air and bums explosively. Gasses produced by the combustion push the piston drawn for the exhaustative gases throughly exhaust silencer. (Power stroke). During the exhaust stroke the piston moves up and forces the burned gases out of the cylinder. This type of engine have diesel injected system.<br><br>
Gas Engine:<br>
The working of four stroke gas engine. In four strokes are in take stroke, compression stroke, power stroke and exhaust stroke. The energy cycle of engine begins in take stroke. As the pistion moves down cylinder and draws in a gas mixture. Next the piston compresses the mixture while moving up the piston (cylinder). At the top of the compressions stroke the spark plug ignites the gas. Burning gases push the piston down for the power stroke. The piston then moves up the cylinder again. Pushing the burned gases out during the exhaust stroke. Engine starts with gas and petrol and kirocene.<br>
There are disadvantages associated with the prior art. One of the main disadvantages is that cost of the fuel is high and with low consumption, high maintenance. More carbon deposition need of expert trainee technicians to repair and spares will be available with high price.<br>
Objects and advantages of the present invention<br>
Therefore the main object of the present invention is to provide waterlifting engine where in minimum expenditure of fuel and get maximum benifits<br>
This engine neither having a corborater nor having a fuel injecting system. Engine starts and runs with gas (LPG, Natural Gas, CNG, LNG, BIO Gas. Gober Gas, etc.) only. This enging having ventury &amp; gas vaparising system.<br>
Another object of the present invention to provide a waterlifiting engine having the means to reduce the input energy and the engine does not heated in a long time period of running.<br>
Yet another object of present invention is to provide waterlifting device which can<br><br>
be use to lift water from all kind of watersources like rivers, Wells, Borewells ana Ponds etc..<br>
Another object of the present invention is which can be transported easily from one place to another place.<br>
Advantages of the present invention<br>
High consumption, low maintanence, simple mechanism (No need of trainee techinicans to repair), No carbon depositon, Ecofriendiy, Spares will be available at low price.<br>
The following description contains many specifics. These should not be construed has limitation on the scope of the invention, but rather as an exemplification fo one prefered embodiment thereof. Many other variation are possible, accordingly the scope of the invention should not be limited to the embodiment illustrated, and t. the attrations and variations may be treated within the spirit and scope of this invention.<br>
Brief discription of the invention.   <br>
In this invention ventury and  gas vapourising system introduced. In the agriculture filed this kind of engines are not available, Gas enters into the ventury through inlet nipple and goes upward direction then mixes with the air.<br>
We can use this invention for water lifting from resources, aerrators, power generating systems.<br>
The ventury and gas vapouriser control the gas and gives high consumption<br><br>
DETAILED DISCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Till now no one company in the world has manufactured a 475CC engine used in agriculture and aquaculture. This invention starts and runs only with gas (LPG, Natural Gas, CNG, LNG, Gobber Gas, Bio Gas, Wonder Gas etc.,)<br>
In our invention the main object is VENTURY which means the mixing process. In our invention there is no carbourator and fuel injection system. But introducing the ventury into the engine. An hollow tube placed inside the tumbler vertically. The air from the atmosphere enters in to the ventury through this tube and mixes the gas with the air. Gas enters in to the ventury through Intel nipple and goes upward direction then the mixtures with the air. Then the air bubbles containing the mixture of air and gas goes onto the piston top by inlet valve operation. Ventury is a system is made for increasing the pressure inside.<br>
In every carbourater (2 stroke, 4 stroke) the ventury system included but in our invention without using the carbourater only ventury system is used. The engine completely based on this ventury system. This ventury system depends upon the air. This ventury system operates the complete governing system.<br>
