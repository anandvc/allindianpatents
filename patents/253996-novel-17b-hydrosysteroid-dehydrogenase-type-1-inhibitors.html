				<td>The present invention relates to a 3, 15-substituted estrone compound of general formula 1.<br>
The present invention relates to novel 3, 15 substituted estrone derivatives which represent inhibitory compounds of the 17ß-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (17ß-HSD1) enzyme, to their salts, to pharmaceutical preparations containing these compounds and to processes for the preparation of these compounds. Furthermore, the invention concerns the therapeutic use of said novel 3,15 substituted estrone derivatives, particularly their use in the treatment or prevention of steroid hormone dependent diseases or disorders, such as steroid hormone dependent diseases or disorders requiring the inhibition of the 17ß-HSD1 enzyme and/or requiring the towering of the endogenous 17ß-estradiol concentration. In addition, the present invention relates to the general use of selective 17ß-HSD1 inhibitors which possess in addition no or only pure antagonistic binding affinities to the estrogen receptor for the treatment and prevention of benign gynaecological disorders, in particular endometriosis.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
The publications and other materials used herein to illuminate the background of the invention, and in particular, cases to provide additional details respecting the practice, are incorporated by reference.<br>
Mammalian 17ß-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (17ß-HSDs) are NAD(H) or NADP(H) dependent enzymes which catalyse - besides other reactions - the final steps in male and female sex hormone biosynthesis. These enzymes convert inactive 17-keto-steroids into their active 17ß-hydroxy-forms or catalyse the oxidation of the 17ß-hydroxy-forms into the 17-keto-steroids. Because both estrogens and androgens have the highest affinity for their receptors in the 17ß-hydroxy form, 17ß-HSD enzymes play an essential rote in the tissue-selective regulation of the activity of sex steroid hormones.<br>
At present 10 human members of the 17ß-HSD enzyme family have been described (types 1-5, 7, 8, 10-12). The human 17ß-HSD family members share less than 30% similarity in their primary structure. The 17ß-HSDs are expressed in distinct, though in some cases, overlapping pat- <br>
terns. The different types of 17J}-HSDs also differ in their substrate and cofactor specificities. In intact cells in culture, the 17|3-HSDs catalyse the reaction in a unidirectional way: types 1,3, 5 and 7 use NADP(H) as a cofactor and catalyse the reductive reaction (activation), while types 2, 4, 8 and 10 catalyse the oxidative reaction (inactivation) using NAD(H) as a cofactor [see e.g. Labrie et al. (2000) Trends Endocrinol Metab, 11:421-7, and Adamski &amp; Jakob (2001) Mol Cell Endocrinol, 171:1-4].<br>
Due to their essential role in the tissue-selective regulation of the activity of sex steroid hormones 17β-HSDs can be involved in the occurrence and development of estrogen-sensitive pathologies (f. ex. breast, ovarian, and endometrium cancers etc.) and androgen-sensitive pathologies (f. ex. prostate cancer, benign prostatic hyperplasia, acne, hirsutism, etc). Furthermore, many types of17β-HSD have been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of particular human disorders. For example, the17β-HSD3 is known to be involved in the development of pseudohermaph-roditism, the 17β-HSD8 plays a role in polycystic kidney disease and the 17β-HSD4 is related to the occurrence of bifunctional enzyme deficiency. Therefore treatment of sex steroid-sensitive diseases by administration of specific inhibitors of the 17f3-HSDs enzymes have been suggested, optionally in combination with potent and specific anti-estrogens and anti-androgens [Labrie F et al. (1997) Steroids, 62:148-58].<br>
Due to the fact that each type of17β-HSD has a selective substrate affinity, directional (reductive or oxidative) activity in intact cells, and a particular tissue distribution, the selectivity of drug action could be achieved-by targeting a particular 17β-HSD Isozyme. By individual modulation of the particular 17β-HSDs It is possible to influence or even control the local and paracrine concentration of estrogens and androgens in different target tissues.<br>
The best characterized member of the17β-HSD family is the17β-HSD1 [EC 1.1.1.62]. This enzyme could be crystallized in different states of functionality (e.g. with and without ligand and/or co-factor). In vitro, the17β-HSD1 enzyme catalyses the reduction and the oxidation between es-trone (E1) and estradiol (E2). However, under physiological in vivo conditions the enzyme only catalyses the reductive reaction from the estrone (E1) to the estradiol (E2). The 17β-HSD1 was found to be expressed in a variety of hormone-dependent tissues, e.g. placenta, mammary gland tissue or uterus and endometrium tissue, respectively. Estradiol itself is, especially in comparison to the significantly less active estrone, a very potent hormone, which regulates the expression of a variety of genes by binding to the nuclear estrogen receptor and plays an essential role in the proliferation and differentiation of the target cell. Physiological as well as pathological cell proliferations can be estradiol dependent Especially many breast cancer cells are stimulated by a locally raised estradiol concentration. Furthermore, the occurrence or course of benign pathologies such as en-<br>
dometriosis, uterine leiomyomas (fibroids or myomas), adenomyosis, menorrhagia, metrorrhagia and dysmenorrhoea is dependent from the existence of significantly high estradiol levels.<br>
Endometriosis is a well-known gynaecological disorder that affects 10 to 15% of women in the reproductive age. It is a benign disease defined as the presence of viable endometrial gland and stroma cells outside the uterine cavity. It is most frequently found in the pelvic area, in women developing endometriosis, the endometrial cells entering the peritoneal cavity by retrograde menstruation (the most likely mechanism) nave the capacity to adhere to and invade the peritoneal lining, and are then able to implant and grow. The implants respond to steroid hormones of the menstrual cycle in a similar way as the endometrium in the uterus. The infiltrating lesions and the blood from these lesions which are unable to leave the body cause inflammation of the surrounding tissue. The most common symptoms of endometriosis are dysmenorrhoea, dyspareunia and (chronic) abdominal pain. The occurrence of these symptoms is not related to the extent of the lesions. Some women with severe endometriosis are asymptomatic, while women with mild endometriosis may have severe pain. Up to now, no reliable non-invasive test is available to diagnose endometriosis. Laparoscopy has to be performed to diagnose the disease. Endometriosis is classified according to the 4 stages set up by the American Fertility Society (AFS). Stage I corresponds to minimal disease while stage IV is severe, depending on the location and the extent of the endometriosis. Endometriosis is found In up to 50% of the women with infertility. However, currently no causal relation has been proven between mild endometriosis and infertility. Moderate to severe endometriosis can cause tubal damage and adhesions leading to infertility. The aims of treatment of endometriosis are pain relief, resolution of the endometriotic tissue and restoration of fertility (if desired). The two common treatments are surgery or anti-inflammatory and/or hormonal therapy or a combination thereof.<br>
Uterine leiomyomas (fibroids or myomas), benign clonal tumours, arise from smooth muscle cells of the human uterus. They are clinically apparent in up to 25% of women and are the single, most common indication for hysterectomy. They cause significant morbidity, including prolonged and heavy menstrual bleeding, pelvic pressure and pain, urinary problems, and, In rare cases, reproductive dysfunction. The pathophysiology of myomas is not well understood. Myomas are found submucosally (beneath the endometrium), intramuralty (within the myometrium) and subserosally (projecting out of the serosal compartment of the uterus), but mostly are mixed forms of these 3 different types. The presence of estrogen receptors in leiomyoma cells has been studied by Tamaya et al. [Tamaya et al. (1985) Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand. 64:307-9]. They have shown that the ratios of estrogen receptor compared to progesterone and androgen receptor levels were higher in leiomyomas than in the corresponding normal myometrium. Surgery has long been the main treatment for myomas. Furthermore, medical therapies that have been proposed to treat myomas include administration of a variety of steroids such as the androgenic steroids danazol or<br>
gestrinone, GnRH agonists and progestogens, whereby the administration is often associated a variety of serious side-effects.<br>
Everything that has been said above in relation to the treatment of uterine leiomyomas and endometriosis equally applies to other benign gynaecological disorders, notably adenomyosis, functional menorrhagia and metrorrhagia. These benign gynaecological disorders are all estrogen sensitive and are treated in a comparable way as described herein before in relation to uterine leiornyomas and endometriosis, The available pharmaceutical treatments, however, suffer from the same major drawbacks, i.e. they have to be discontinued once the side-effects become more serious than the symptoms to be treated and symptoms reappear after discontinuation of the therapy.<br>
Since the aforementioned malign and benign pathologies are all 17j3-estradiol dependent, a reduction of the endogenous 17|3-estradiol concentration in the respective tissue will result in an impaired or reduced proliferation of 17(3-estradiol cells in said tissues. Therefore, it may be concluded that selective inhibitors of the17β-HSD1 enzyme are well suited for their use to impair endogenous productions of estrogens, in particular of 17β-estradiol, in myomas, endometriotic, ade-nomyotic and endometrial tissue. The application of a compound acting as selective inhibitor on the17β-HSD1 which preferentially catalyses the reductive reaction will result in a lowered intracellular estradiol-concentration since the reductive conversion of the estrone into the active estradiol is reduced or suppressed. Therefore, reversible or even irreversible inhibitors of the 17β-HSD1 may play a significant role in the prophylaxis and/or treatment of steroid-hormone, in particular 17(3-estradiol, dependent disorders or diseases.-Furthermore, the reversible or even irreversible inhibitors of the 170-HSD1 should have no or only pure antagonistic binding activities to the estradiol receptor, in particular to the estrogen receptor a subtype, since agonistic binding of the estrogen receptor would lead to activation and therefore - by regulation of a variety of genes - to the proliferation and differentiation of the target cell. In contrast, antagonists of the estrogen receptor, so called anti-estrogens, bind competitively to the specific receptor protein thus preventing access of endogenous estrogens to their specific binding site.<br>
At present it is described in the literature that several malignant disease as breast cancer, prostate carcinoma, ovarian cancer, uterine cancer, endometrial cancer and endometrial hyperpla-sia may be treated by the administration of a selective 1?p-HSD1 inhibitor. Furthermore, a selective 17β-HSD1 inhibitor may be useful for the prevention of the aforementioned hormone-dependent cancers, especially breast cancer. The international patent application WO 2004/080271 discloses the use of a particular17β-HSD1 inhibitor, so called compound A, for prevention or treatment of disorders caused by the 17HSD1 enzyme activity, in particular breast cancer. Furthermore, the international patent application WO 03/017973 describes the use of a selective estrogen enzyme modulator (SEEM) in the manufacture of a drug delivery vehicle for use in a method of treating or<br>
preventing a benign gynaecological disorder in a mammalian female, said benign gynaecological disorder being selected from the group consisting of uterine leiomyomas, endometriosis, adenomy-osis, functional menorrhagia and metrorrhagia, wherein the method comprises the intravaginal administration of the SEEM to the female suffering from the benign gynaecological disorder in a therapeutically effective dosage to prevent or reduce the symptoms of said benign gynaecological disorder, said SEEM being selected from the group consisting of aromatase inhibitors, cydo-oxygenase2 (COX-2) inhibitors, 17(3-HSD1 inhibitors and combinations thereof.<br>
Several reversible or irreversible inhibitors of the 17β-HSD1 enzyme of steroidal and even non-steroidal origin are already known from the literature. The characteristics of these inhibitory molecules, which mainly have a substrate or cofactor-like core structure, have been reported in the literature [reviewed in: Poirier D. (2003) Curr Med Chem. 10:453-77].<br>
For example, Tremblay and Poirier describe an estradiol derivative, 16-[carbamoyl-(bromo-methyl)-alkyl]-estradiol, and tested the same in respect of its inhibition of the estradiol formation catalysed by the enzyme 17J3-HSD1 [Tremblay &amp; Poirier (1998) J. Steroid Biochem. Molec. BioL, 66:179-191]. Poirier and colleagues describe a 6p-1hiaheptan-butyl-methyl-amide derivative of estradiol as a potent and selective inhibitor of the 17HSD1 enzyme [Poirier et al. (1998) J. Steroid Biochem. Molec. BioL, 64:83-90]. Furthermore, Poirier and colleagues describe new derivatives of 17β-estradiol with N-butyl, N-methyl alkylamide side chains of three different lengths (n=8, 10 or 12) at position 15, which might be potential inhibitors of the 17B-HSD enzyme [Poirier et al. (1991) Tetrahedron,'47(37):7751-7766]. The biological activity of these compounds was prtly tested with, regard to .estrogen receptor binding affinity, estrogenic and anti-estrogenic activity [Poirier et al. (1996) Bioorg Med Chem Lett 6(21):2537-2542]. In addition, Pelletier and Poirier describe novel 17B-estradiol derivatives with different bromo-alkyl side chains, which might be potential inhibitors of the 173-HSD enzyme [Pelletier &amp; Poirier (1996) Bioorg Med Chem, 4(10):1617-1628]. Sam and colleagues describe several estradiol derivatives with a halogenated alkyl side chain in 16a or 17a position of the steroidal D ring which possess 17B-HSD1 inhibiting properties [Sam et al. (1998) Drug Design and Discovery, 15:157-180]. Furthermore, the finding that some anti-estrogens, such as tamoxifen, possess weak 17B-HSD inhibiting properties suggested that it may be possible to develop a potent 17B-HSD1 inhibitor that is also anti-estrogenic [reviewed in: Poirier D. (2003) Curr Med Chem. 10:453-77]. Several of the aforementioned already known compounds also display anti-estrogenic properties (e.g. the 6B-thiaheptan-butyl-methyl-amide derivative of estradiol described by Poirier and colleagues [Poirier et al. (1998) J. Steroid Biochem. Molec. Biol., 64:83-90]). None of the aforementioned compounds has been clinically used so far.<br>

Furthermore, the international patent application WO 2004/085457 discloses a variety of es-tron derivatives with different subs'rtuents in C3, C6, C16 and/or C17 position as potent 17β-HSD1 inhibitors.<br>
Furthermore, the synthesis of different B-, C- and D-ring substituted estradiol carboxylic esters was described by Labaree et al. [Labaree et al. (2003) J. Med. Chem. 46:1886-1904]. However, these esters were only analysed with regard to their estrogenic potential. The related international patent application WO 2004/085345 discloses 15a substituted estradiol compounds bearing a -<ch2 side chain wherein r is h a ci to cs alkyl group optionally substituted with at least one halogen such as ch2ch2f or other ch2chf2 ch2cf3 cf3 and m from this estradiol esters are described locally active estrogens without significant systemic action.></ch2>
Accordingly, there is a need for the development of compounds which are suited for the treatment and/or prevention of steroid hormone dependent diseases or disorders such as breast cancer, endometriosis and uterine leiomyomas by selectively Inhibiting the 17β-HSD1 enzyme, while desirably failing to substantially inhibit other members of the17β-HSD protein family or other catalysts of sex steroid degradation or activation. In particular, it is an aim of the present invention to develop selective inhibitors of the17β-HSD1 enzyme, whereby in addition the compounds have no or only pure antagonistic binding affinities to the estrogen receptor (both subtypes a and (3). Furthermore, there is still a need to provide a new type of therapy regimen for estrogen dependent benign gynaecological disorders, particularly for pre.-,and psri-menopausal females, whereby the therapy should not cause serious side-effects.<br>

One or more compounds may be present in association with one or more non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable auxiliaries such as excipients, adjuvants (e.g. buffers), carriers, inert solid diluents, suspensing agents, preservatives, fillers, stabilizers, anti-oxidants, food additives, bioavailability enhancers, coating materials, granulating and disintegrating agents, binding agents etc., and, if desired, other active ingredients.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition may be formulated for example as immediate release, sustained release, pulsatile release, two or more step release, depot or other kind of release formulations.<br>
The manufacture of the pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention may be performed according to methods known in the art and will be explained in further detail below. Commonly known and used pharmaceutically acceptable auxiliaries as well as further suitable diluents, flavorings, sweetening agents, coloring agents etc. may be used, depending on the intended mode of administration as well as particular characteristics of the active compound to be used, such as solubility, bioavailability etc. Suitable auxiliaries and further ingredients may be such as recommended for pharmacy, cosmetics and related fields and which preferably are listed in the European Pharmacopoeia, FDA approved or cited in the "GRAS" list (FDA List of food additives that are 'generally recognized as safe' (GRAS)).<br>
One mode of application of the compounds of general formula (I) or of pharmaceutical compositions comprising one or more of said compounds is oral application, e. g., by tablets, pills, dragees, hard and soft gel capsules, granules, pellets, aqueous, lipid, oily or other solutions, emulsions such as oil-in-water emulsions, liposomes, aqueous or oily suspensions, syrups, elixiers,<br>
solid emulsions, solid dispersions or dispersible powders. For the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions for oral administration, the compounds suitable for the purposes of the present invention as defined above can be admixed with commonly known and used adjuvants and excipients such as for example, gum arable, talcum, starch, sugars (such as, e. g., mannitose, methyl cellulose, lactose), gelatin, surface-active agents, magnesium stearate, aqueous or non-aqueous solvents, paraffin derivatives, cross-linking agents, dispersants, emulsifiers, lubricants, conserving agents, flavoring agents (e. g., ethereal oils), solubility enhancers (e. g., benzyl benzoate or benzyl alcohol) or bioavailabilrty enhancers (e.g. Gelucire™). In the pharmaceutical composition, the active ingredients may also be dispersed in a microparticle, e. g. a nanoparticulate, composition.<br>
For parenteral administration, the active agents can be dissolved or suspended in a physiologically acceptable diluent, such as, e. g., water, buffer, oils with or without solubilizers, surface-active agents, dispersants or emulsifiers. As oils for example and without limitation, olive oil, peanut oil, cottonseed oil, soybean oil, castor oil and sesame oil may be used. More generally spoken, for parenteral administration the active agent can be in the form of an aqueous, lipid, oily or other kind of solution or suspension or even administered in the form of liposomes or nano-suspensions.<br>
Transdermal application can be accomplished by suitable patches, as generally known in the art, specifically designed for the transdermal delivery of active agents, optionally in the presence of. specific permeability enhancers. Furthermore, also emulsions, ointments, pastes, creams or gels may be used for transdermal delivery.<br>
Another suitable mode of administration Is via intravaginal devices (e. g. vaginal rings) or intrauterine systems (IDS) containing reservoirs for controlled release of active agents over extended periods of time. For rectal or vaginal administration of the drug the compounds may also be administered In the form of suppositories. These compositions can be prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable non-irritating excipient which Is solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at the rectal or vaginal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum or vagina to release the drug.<br>
Another mode of application is by implantation of a depot implant comprising an inert carrier material, such as biologically degradable polymers or synthetic silicones such as e. g. silicone rubber. Such implants are designed to release the active agent in a controlled manner over an extended period of time (e. g., 3 to 5 years).<br>
It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the particular method of administration will depend on a variety of factors, all of which are considered routinely when administering therapeutics. It will also be understood, however, that the actual dosages of the agents of this<br>
invention for any given patient will depend upon a variety of factors, including, but not limited to the activity of the specific compound employed, the particular composition formulated, the mode of administration, time of administration, route of administration and the particular site, host, and disease being treated, and furthermore the age of the patient, the body weight of the patient, the general health of the patient, the gender of the patient, the diet of the patient, rate of excretion, drug combinations, and the severity of the condition undergoing therapy. It will be further appreciated by one skilled in the art that the optimal course of treatment, i.e., the mode of treatment and the daily number of doses of a compound of Formula I or a pharmaceufically acceptable salt thereof given for a defined number of days, can be ascertained by those skilled in the art using conventional treatment tests. Optimal dosages for a given set of conditions may be ascertained by those skilled in the art using conventional dosage-determination tests in view of the experimental data for a given compound. For oral administration, an exemplary daily dose generally employed will be from about 0.01 pg/kg to about 100 mg/kg of total body weight, whereby courses of treatment may be repeated at appropriate time intervals. Administration of pro-drugs may be dosed at weight levels that are chemically equivalent to the weight levels of the fully active compounds. The daily dosage for parenteral administration will generally be from about 0.01 ug/kg to about 100 mg/kg of total body weight. A daily rectal dosage regimen will generally be from about 0.01 pg/kg to about 200 mg/kg of total body weight A daily vaginal dosage regimen will generally be from about 0.01 ug/kg to about 100 mg/kg of total body weight The dally topical dosage regimen will generally be from about 0.1 ug to about 100 mg administered between one to four times daily.

HBr solution (48% HBr in water, 1280 ml, 11.22 mol) was added dropwise to refluxing dry THF (810 ml, 9.99 mol) over a period of 2.25 hour. After complete addition, 1H-NMR analysis of a sample showed that the reaction was completed. The reaction mixture was cooled to RT, transferred to a 10 I reaction flask and, while stirred mechanically, carefully neutralized with NaHCO3 solution. The layers were separated and the organic layer was washed with brine, dried over NaaSO4 and the solvent was removed on the rotary evaporator. The resulting yellow oil was used in the next step without further purification<br>
2-(4-Bromo-butoxvVtetrahvdro-pvran<br>
Crude product 4-bromo-butanol was dissolved in DCM (500 ml) and dried over Na2SO4 and pTosOH (500 mg) was added. Dihydropyran (1181 ml) was added dropwise at 0°C and during the addition the temperature was kept under 8°C. The reaction was allowed to reach RT overnight, washed with saturated NaHC03 solution (2x 300 ml) and brine (9.3 I). The aqueous layers were washed with TBME (300 ml) and the combined organic layers were dried over anhydrous K2CO3. The mixture was filtered off and the solvent was removed on the rotary evaporator. This yielded<br>
593 g (yield = 25% over 2 steps). The obtained 4-bromo-butanol-THP ether was filtrated twice over SiO2 (DCM with 1 % MeOH). Finally, the compound was purified by column chromatography (20 I SiO2, DCM with 1% MeOH). This yielded 220.6 g of 2-(4-Bromo-butoxy)-tetrahydro-pyran (yield = 9.3% over 2 steps) as a TLC-pure light yellow oil.<br>
3-Methoxv-15B-r4-(tetrahydro-pvran-2-vloxvVbutvn-estra-1.3.5(10Vtrien-17-one(XXX-4b-THP^<br>
Magnesium (29.6 g, 2.0 mol) was stirred overnight with broken glass under N2 in a flame dried 3 neck flask. The magnesium was extra activated by the addition of some iodine and by adding a few drops pure 2-(4-Bromo-butoxy)-tetrahydro-pyran. After the Grignard reaction had started, 2-(4-Bromo-butoxy)-tetrahydro-pyran (121 g, 510 mmol) in 500 ml dry THF was added dropwise, maintaining a gentle reflux. After complete addition of the reaction mixture, it was stirred for 0.5 hour. The solution was transferred to a flame dried 3-neck flask containing copper (I) iodide (9 g, 47 mmol) and HMPA (100 ml). The resulting reaction mixture was cooled to -40 ± 5°C after which a mixture of the 15,16-unsaturated estron of the formula Xb (24 g, 85 mmol) and TMSCI (21 ml, 196 mmol), dissolved in dry THF (500 ml), was added dropwise. After complete addition, the mixture was allowed to reach RT over 3 days.<br>
10% NH4CI (in water and ice, 11) was added to the reaction mixture. The layers were separated and the water layer was extracted with EtOAc (2x 500 ml). The combined organic layers were washed with brine (500 ml), dried over Na2SO4 and the solvent was removed on the rotary evaporator. This yielded 103.6 g of yellow oil, containing HMPA. The oil was then stirred with K2CO3 (12.1 g, 87 mmol) in methanol (2.75 I) under N2 to hydrolyze the silyl ether. The hydrolysis was; followed by TLC (EtOAc / heptane: 1/9), which after 40 minutes showed that the reaction was complete. 0.75 I water was added and most of the methanol was removed on the rotary evaporator. 500 ml EtOAc was added, the layers were separated and the water layer was extracted with EtOAc (2x 500 ml). The organic layers were combined, dried over Na2SO4 and the solvent was removed on the rotary evaporator. This yielded 82.5 g yellow oil which contains product XXX-4b-THP, HMPA and silyl residues.<br>
15p-f4-Hvdroxv-butvlV3-methoxv-estra-1.3.5(10Hrien-17-one (XXXI g-4b)<br>
Crude compound XXX-4b-THP (82.5 g yellow oil) was dissolved in MeOH (2,5 L) and p-TosOH (6 g, 32 mmol) was added. The reaction was followed by TLC (toluene / acetone: 3/1) and 1H-NMR. After 1 hour the reaction was completed. Most of the MeOH was removed on the rotary evaporator and after this 1 I water was added. The resulting mixture was extracted with DCM (3x 400 ml).

Dissolving aldehydes Xlll-Ob (R1=CH3) or XIII-Oc (R1=benzyl) in benzylamine and reduction of the residual imine in THF gave benzylamine XIV-1b (R1=CH3) and XIV-1c (R1=benzyl), which were debenzylated to XV-1b (R1=CH3) and XV-1a (R1=H), using Pd/C and H2 at 5 bar, and dissolved in dilute HCI to give the respective ammonium chlorides XXIX-1b (R1=CH3) and XXIX-1a (R1=H). Standard purification methods failed due to what seems to be instability of these ammonium salts.

BIOLOGICAL TESTING MATERIALS AND METHODS<br>
1. Inhibition of the 17B-hvdroxvsteroid dehvdrooenase type 1 enzyme<br>
17|3-HSD1 purification: Recombinant baculovirus was generated by the "Bac to Bac Expression System" (Invitrogen). Recombinant bacmid was transfected to Sf9 insect cells using "Ceilfectin Reagent" {Invitrogen). 60h later cells were harvested; the microsomal fraction was isolated as described by Puranen etal. 1994. Aliquots were stored frozen until determination of enzymatic activity.<br>
Assay - Inhibition of recombinant human 17(3-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1: Recombinant protein (0.1ug/ml) was incubated in 20 mM KH2PO4 pH 7.4 with 30 nM 3H-estrone and 1 mM NADPH for 30 min at RT, in the presence of potential inhibitors at concentrations of 1 uM or 0.1 pM. Inhibitor stock solutions were prepared in DMSO. Rnal concentration of DMSO was adjusted to 1 % in all samples. The enzyme reaction was stopped by addition of 10 % tri-chloroacetic acid (final concentration). Samples were centrifuged in a microtiter plate at 4000 rpm for 10 min. Supsmatants were applied to reverse phase HPLC on a Waters Symmetry C18 column, equipped with a Waters Sentry Guard column. Isocratic HPLC runs were performed at RT at a flow rate of 1 ml/min of acetonitrile:water 48:52 as running solvent Radioactivity was monitored in the eluate by a Packard Flow Scintillation Analyzer. Total radioactivity for estrone and estradiol were determined in each sample and percent conversion of estrone to estradiol was calculated according to the following formula:<br>
% conversion = 100 *<br>
{(cpm estradiol in sample with inhibitor) / [(cpm estrone in sample with inhibitor) + (cpm estradiol in sample with inhibitor)]}<br>
{(cpm estradiol in sample without inhibitor) / [(cpm estrone in sample without inhibitor) + (cpm estradiol in sample without inhibitor)]}.<br>
Percent inhibition was calculated as follows:   % Inhibition = 100 - %conversion<br>
The values "% inhibition" were determined for exemplified compounds, and the results are summarized in Table 42.<br>

2. Estrogen Receptor Binding Assay<br>
The binding affinity of the compounds of the invention to the estrogen receptor a and to the estrogen receptor p may be determined according to the in vitro ER binding assays described by Koffmann et al. [Koffmann et al. (1991) J. Steroid. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 38:135]. Alternatively, an estrogen receptor binding assay may be performed according to international patent application PCT/US/17799 (published as WO 00/07996).<br>
3. Estrogen Receptor Transactivation Assays<br>
Compounds of the invention showing binding affinity towards the estrogen receptor may be further tested with regard to their individual estrogenic or anti-estrogenic potential (agonistic binding or antagonistic binding to the ERa or ERjJ). The determination of the estrogen receptor agonist activity may be performed according to an in vitro assay system using the MMTV-ERE-LUC reporter system which is for example described within US patent application No. 10/289079 (published as US 2003/0170292):<br>
To assay estrogen receptor agonist activity, Hela cells are grown In 24-well microtiter plates and then transiently co-transfected with two plasmids using lipofedamine. The first plasmid comprises DNA encoding human estrogen receptor (either ER-alpha or ER-beta), and the second plasmid comprises an estrogen-driven reporter system comprising: a luciferase reporter gene (LUC) whose transcription is under the control of upstream regulatory elements comprising 4 copies of the vitellogenin estrogen response element (ERE) cloned into the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter (the full name for the reporter system being "MMTV-ERE-LUC"). Cells are exposed to the compounds of the invention in RPMI 1640 medium, supplemented with 10% char-<br>
coal-treated fetal calf serum, 2 rnM L-glutamine, 0.1 mM non-essential amino acids and 1 mM sodium pyruvate for 42-48 hours at 37°C in a 5% carbon dioxide incubator. Concurrently, cells exposed to estradiol (1 nM) serve as positive controls. Replicate wells exposed to the solvent in which the compounds of the invention are dissolved (i.e. ethanol or methanol) are used as negative controls. After the 42-48.hr incubation period, cells are rinsed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), lysis buffer (Promega Corp) is added, and cell lysates are collected for measurement of luciferase activity with a luminometer. Estrogenic activity of the compounds of the invention is expressed as fold-increase in luciferase activity as compared to that observed in negative control cells.<br>
Alternatively, the determination of the estrogen receptor transactivation activity (estrogenicity assay or agonist assay) and of the inhibitory potency of transactivation activity (anti-estrogenicity assay or antagonist assay) may be performed according to international patent application PCT/US/17799 (published as WO 00/07996).<br>
