				<td>Process for manufacture of conical nipples<br>
Description<br>
Technical Aspect<br>
The invention concerns a process for manufacture of a conical nipple, in which a hollow cylinder is formed from a sheet metal to start with, where the contacting edges of the sheet metal are jointed with a material engagement.<br>
State-of-Art Technology<br>
Such a process is known from the Patent Document DE 197 55 391 A1. In that, a sheet metal strip is first produced as a hollow cylinder and through subsequent forging/forming transformed in the shape of a support/bearing ring. The edges coming in contact are jointed through welding or through soldering under a material judgement with one another. The subsequent forming can happen through rolling or deep drawing, where the support ring can be with diverse contours. Generally, in support rings, at least in the side of the outer circumference, a high degree of surface quality is essential, because this surface forms a static sealing-surface, in order to seal the conical nipple against housing. For this purpose, a good roundness and a lesser roughness are essential. In jointing through soldering, the disadvantage is for achieving a good capillary effect, the interval/distance of the edges coming in contact should be minimal, and that the surface is wettable. In jointing with material engagement through welding often concave bulges occur on the jointing spots, which are caused by material transformation. The concave bulges can also result in the conical nipples becoming leaky.<br>
Illustration of the Invention<br><br>
The invention has the objective to develop a process for manufacturing a conical nipple using which production of conical nipples with a very high static sealing capacity and a minimal material requirement is possible.<br>
This objective is achieved with characteristics of claim 1. Advantageous design variations are presented under sub-claims:<br>
In the process used for the solution for production of a conical nipple, first the hollow cylinder is formed from sheet metal, where the edges coming in contact of the sheet metal are jointed with a material engagement, where the jointing is so obtained that along the edges coming in contact at least on the outer circumference-side a ridge or a build-up gets developed, which in a downstream machining is leveled. A ridge/build-up can be equalized more easily in a downstream machining step than a concave bulge, in which material must be subsequently added. The process is also advantageous as against the resistance-welding in which the edges are arranged overlapping and welded with one another. This process leads to an unsatisfactory jointing/structure and an unsatisfactory surface shape at the jointing spots. Under resistance-welding excess material, adjacent to the side of the point of separation, is plated/leveled and can get disengaged at a later point of time. Under the invention-based process, an especially good surface quality can be obtained, a good static resistance against leak as well as very little deviations in respect of roundness. The edges of the point of separation are exactly produced through the cutting of the rounded body blank at the centre. In so doing, a partial piece, which does not have the desired radius because of the lever movement, is removed from each edge which in the shaping of the hollow cylinder. As a result, an accurate process length not influenced by any forging/shaping operation can be obtained under minimum deviation in roundness. Advantageously, in the invention based process, pre-treated, for example, phosphated sheet metal can be used. This pre-treatment is only  insignificantly influenced through the  invention  based<br><br>
process, especially even through the laser-welding. The heat-influence zone in laser-welding is small so that the pre-treatment is only minimally affected. A pre-treatment of the sheet metal is more cost-competitive than a pre-treatment of the finished support ring.<br>
The edges can be jointed through welding with one another. Welding is a large-series process which enables a high degree of automation. No pretreatment of the edges to be jointed need to be made.<br>
The edges can be jointed with the use of laser radiation welding with one another. In this process, a high energy application on a lesser cross section takes place and thereby only a small zone of smelted material. Only a very minor structural alteration takes place. The welding tool is wear and tear free.<br>
It can be welded with an aggregate. Through welding with aggregate a buiid-up/ridge, defined in its height, can be manufactured; for example, in a preferred version with a height of less than 0,1 mm. This ridge can be easily established through welding with aggregate. The structure of the weld-spot can be influenced through the choice of the aggregate. Prior to the downstream machining, ring-shaped blanks can be skived/paired. For this, a first longer hollow cylinder is prepared from which after the jointing under material engagement the ring shaped blanks are skived. In so doing, the number of the required welding operations gets reduced. The subsequent measuring can be done through rolling. Through the rolling, the stresses caused by the forging/shaping in the structure are reduced through elastic deformation. A multiplicity of forms can be achieved with one tool.<br>
The subsequent machining can be done through deep-drawing. Deep-drawing is a very fast process in which in a short time a large number of pieces can be produced. The subsequent machining can be done through a chip-removing/cutting process.   Depending upon the process, the surface quality can<br><br>
be influenced. Further, additional, even complicated, geometries can be made in the outer circumference. Possible chip removing/cutting processes are: turning, milling and grinding.<br>
The sheet can have a perforation. The sheet can in this context have a punching. This enables a better jointing with elastomers which are used for producing a sealing/gasket on the support ring. The perforation pattern can be created through punching or laser radiation in the sheet metal or sheet strips. In this context, it is advantageous that the subsequent machining does not affect the perforation pattern. In the subsequent machining, the tensile stresses incorporated in the sheet are minimal s that the sheet does not tear with the perforation pattern. Through the perforation pattern, the connection with the elastomer is improved. A pre-treatment of the support ring, for instance, phosphating, can be dispensed with under given circumstances. The perforation is made prior to the forging in the sheet metal, and will not affect the subsequent machining in the cylindrical area.<br>
In yet another version of the solution of the task, a support ring for a gasket through a process using one of the above claims can be obtained.<br>
Short description of the Drawings:<br>
The invention based process as well as an invention based conical nipple are explained in the following based on the figures.<br>
Figures 1 to 4 show the manufacturing process of a support ring of an invention-based sealing/gasket.<br>
Figure 5 shows an invention based washer<br>
Figure 6 shows a support ring with a perforation<br><br>
Explanation of the Invention<br>
Figures 1 to 4 show the invention based process for a production of a support ring 1. In this context, first the hollow cylinder 3 is formed from sheet metal 2 for example through rolling (figure 1). In the next step, the edges coming in contact 4,5 of the plate 2 to be formed into a hollow cylinder 3 are jointed under material engagement with one another. For this purpose, edges 4,5 are buttered to each other and are welded through laser radiation welding and through addition of aggregate 9 under material engaged with one another (Figure 2). The connection is so established that along the edges coming in contact at least at the outer circumference-side, a ridge 6 is obtained (Figure 3). This ridge 6 is leveled in a subsequent machining which is done in this case by rolling. In other versions, the downstream machining can be done through deep drawing or a chip-removing process such as turning, milling or grinding. For reduction of welding operations, the hollow cylinder 3 can also be prepared from which prior to the downstream machining, ring shaped blanks 7 can be cut off from the hollow cylinder 3.<br>
Figure 5 shows a sealing ring/conical nipple 1 with a bearing ring 8. The bearing ring 8 is formed through a hollow cylinder 3 which was produced through the process described above. A dynamic sealing lip 10 is vulcanized on the bearing ring 8. For the bearing ring 8, a sheet metal 2 is used which was treated with a phosphating before hand, in order to improve the adhesibiiity of the elastomers. Figure 6 shows a bearing ring which was produced through a process described above. The bearing ring 8 is equipped with a hole pattern 11, consisting of individual holes, which were punched/stamped prior to the hollow cylinder-shapes in the sheet metal 2 uniformly distributed.<br><br><br>
