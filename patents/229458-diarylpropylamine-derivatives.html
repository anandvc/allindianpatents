N.M.R data were acquired on a Jeol JNM-EX 27 0 or a Varian Unity 500 spectrometer. Spectra were recorded with tetramethylsilane (TMS) as internal standard at 30°C.

BIOLOGICAL EVALUATION<br>
The pharmacological activity of compounds prepared in the Examples was tested using in vitro methods. Functional In vitro studies<br>
Male guinea pigs, weighing about 3 00 g, were killed by a blow on the neck and exsanguinated. Smooth muscle strips of the urinary bladder were dissected in a Krebs-Henseleit solution (pH 7.4). The strip preparations were vertically mounted between two hooks in thermostatically controlled (37°C) organ baths {5 ml). One of the hooks was adjustable and connected to a force transducer (FT 03, Grass Instruments). The Krebs-Henseleit solution was continuously bubbled with carbogen gas (93.5% 02/6.5% CO2) to maintain the pH at 7.4. Isometric tension was recorded by a Grass Polygraph (Model 7 9D). A resting tension of approximately 5 mN was initially applied on each muscle strip and the preparations were allowed to stabilise for at least 45 min. The resting tension was repeatedly adjusted and the preparations were washed several times during the stabilisation period.<br>
Carbachol (carbamylcholine chloride) was used as the standard muscarinic receptor agonist. In each experiment, the viability of the preparations and the reproducibility of their contractile responses were initially tested by two consecutive additions of a submaximal concentration (3 x 10-6 M) of carbachol. A concentration-response curve to carbachol was then generated by cumulative addition of carbachol to the organ-bath (i.e., stepwise increase of the agonist concentration until the maximal contractile response was reached), followed by washing out and a resting period of at least 15 min. before a fix concentration of the test compound (antagonist) was added to the organ-bath. After 6 0 min. of incubation with the antagonist, a second cumulative concentration-response curve to carbachol was generated. Responses were expressed as per cent of the maximal response to carbachol. EC50-values for carbachol in the absence (control) and presence of antagonist were graphically derived and dose ratios (r)<br>
were calculated. Dissociation constants, KB, for the antagonists were calculated using equation (1) (Schild, H.I., Br. J. Pharmacol. Chemother. 1949, 4, 277-280), where [A] is the concentration of test compound:<br>
KB = [A]/r-l  <br>
