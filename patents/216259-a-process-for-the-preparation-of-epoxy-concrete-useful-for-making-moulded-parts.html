				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of epoxy concrete useful for making moulded parts <br>
The present invention particularly relates a process of manufacture and application of epoxy concrete &amp; items made thereof, particularly the machine structure arid machine elements. The epoxy concrete of the present invention is a cold curing mixture of a reactable epoxy resin system (binder) with carefully selected and graded aggregate system (filler). The technology is suitable for manufacturing machine bases, other castable items and components.<br>
The main usages of the epoxy concrete of the present invention are for the manufacture of :<br>
1.Mechanical Engineering : Machine structure, bed and elements specially machine tools structure, bed and elements.<br>
2.Civil Engineering :  Engineering  structures  in  ocean engineer ing as well as in many usual civil  engineering like roof deck, window frame, etc. 3.Chemical Engineering : Pipes, pumps,  valves,  storage<br>
tanks, etc. 4.Electrical &amp; Electronics Engineering  :  Components  of<br>
electrical machinery, printed board, insulator, etc. 5.Miscellaneous applications  :  Biomedieal  engineering, artistic work, etc.<br><br>
Conventional materials used to manufacture machine structures and components are cast iron, mild steel and hydraulic concrete (cement concrete). Each material has its advantages and limitations. The main drawbacks of cast iron are high fabrication cost, very long manufacturing lead times and it gets rusted whereas mild steel has low damping, poor sliding characteristics, long manufacturing lead times, gets rusted and hydraulic concrete has low tensile strength, large shrinkage &amp; moisture absorption, very long curing time. But these are conventional materials in the field of casting technology. Although epoxy concrete has been used for the purpose of casting of machine elements but the technology is well guarded and extensive search in the patent domain revealed no information. While working in this field for several years, thorough search was conducted in the domain of patent, literature, commercial publicity, but no data was available in the public domain to develop the "process" through specific proportions of the composition of the components of the "mixture" to achieve the mechanical properties appropriate for the machine building programmes under the present invention domain.

The main object of the present invention is to provide  a<br><br>
process for t:he preparation of  epoxy  concrete  useful  for making moulded parts.<br>
Another object is to provide a process for making moulded parts using the epoxy concrete of the present invention which obviates the drawbacks as mentioned above and has all the necessary properties of an excellent casting material to replace metal and cement concrete in the art of casting, in strength, freedom from rust, quick in curing and strong in tension and having excellent surface finish which almost does not require any machining.<br>
The three starting raw materials are epoxy resin, epoxy hardener and the aggregate consisting of stone chips/grave 1/granite, sand/silica flour and stone dust/cement/graphite powder/chalk dust. The epoxy resin and hardener are weighed and mixed to prepare the binder. Aggregate or the filler materials after cleaning, drying and weighing are mixed with the binder. The epoxy concrete so prepared as a casting material is ready to be used for casting in a mould which has been assembled after applying mould release agent. The epoxy concrete is poured into the mould and compacted. After appropriate period of curing, demouldirig is done arid fine finishing is applied, if necessary, to get the finished epoxy concrete products.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of epoxy concrete useful for making  moulded<br><br>
parts  which  comprises  (i)  cleaning and  drying  stone chips/gravel/granite,   sand/silica    flour    and    stone dust/cement/graphite powder/chalk  dust  by  known  methods, mixing the said cleaned &amp; dried stone  chips/gravel/granite, sand/silica    flour   and   stone   dust/cement/graphite powder/chalk dust in a ratio in the range of 2 to 4.5 : 1 to 3 : 1 by weight, respectively, to obtain an aggregate; (ii) mixing epoxy resin arid hardener in a ratio in the range of 100 : 6 to 10 by weight to obtain a binder; (iii)  mixing thoroughly  the  aggregate  and  binder,   so obtained, in a ratio in the range of 3.2  to  10.5  :  1  by weight to obtain epoxy concrete.<br>
The stone chips/gravel/granite used may be of size in the range of (1.4-2.0) to (25-40) mm.<br>
The  epoxy  resin  and  hardener  used  may be  such  as<br>
thermosetting resin and amines, both aliphatic  &amp;  aromatic, respectively.<br>
In  the  process  of  the  present  invention  the  epoxy<br>
concrete comprises three starting raw materials, namely epoxy resin &amp; hardener, the third component being the aggregate consisting of stone chips/gravel/granlte, sand/silica flour and stone dust/cement/graphite powder/chalk dust in the proportion by weight 2 to 4.5 is to 1 to 3 is to .1 . The aggregates are cleaned and dried at 100 to 350 degree Centigrade. The epoxy resin and hardener are<br><br>
mixed in the proportion by weight 100 is to 6 to 10 and then the aggregate in the above mentioned proportion is mixed wilh "cpoxy rosin and hardener mixture" in the proportion by weight 3.2 to 10.5 is to 1 to complete the formation of epoxy concrete as a pouring material for casting.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for making moulded parts using epoxy concrete, prepared by the process of the present invention as described above, which comprises cleaning by known methods, a mould made of highly rigid material, treating the cleaned moult! with a known mould release agent, sealing the treated mould, pouring the epoxy concrete, compacting the epoxy concrete so poured to remove voids, repeating till the mould is completely filled and allowing it to stand for curing for a period in the range of 12 to 48 hours followed by demoulding and fine finishing, il roqu i r •
The mould material may be wood, aluminium, wood with aluminium sheathing, etc for a temporary mould and a highly rigid material such as mild steel, spheroidal graphite iron, special steel, etc for a permanent mould.<br>
The mould release agent used may be such as silicone grease, wax polish, ordinary grease.<br>
The compaction of the epoxy concrete may be effected using means such as a vibrator, pressure, combination of pressure arid v j bra tor.<br><br>
The sealing of the mould before pouring may be effected using plasticine, modelling clay, rubber/plastic sheet, soap.<br>
The casting process of the present invention consists of preparation of mould made of wood, aluminium, mild steel, spheroidal graphite or any highly rigid material which may be called special purpose steel when the mould is having the surface finish of 0.15 to 0.95 micro meter and when the maximum aggregate or the filler size to the minimum thickness of finished product of epoxy concrete casting ratio is 0.15 to 0.5. The epoxy concrete prepared for casting is poured continuously or in batches into the properly clamped mould treated with mould release agent and compacted until the mould is completely filled up and left for curing for 12 to 48 hours.<br>
The properly weighed raw materials, namely the resin the hardener and the filler materials in the proportions given in the statement above are mixed thoroughly in a suitable mixer and poured inside the mould made of materials and having requisite surface finish. The mould is surface treated with the mould release agent and the mould is sealed before the casting material is compacted suitably, say, through a vibrator/pressure or by other type of compactor with which the mould is rigidly clamped until the mould is completely filled up and allowed to remain for the duration<br><br>
of curing time and taken out through demoulding and fine finish ing is done, if needed, to get the finished product.<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration of the present invention and should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention :<br>
