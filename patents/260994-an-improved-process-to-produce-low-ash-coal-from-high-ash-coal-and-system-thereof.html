				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process to produce low ash clean<br>
coal from high ash coal. The invention further relates to a system for producing<br>
low ash clean coal from high ash coal including high recovery of solvents<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Concept and implementation of chemical beneficiation comes from the limitation<br>
of physical beneficiation processes. Broadly, a chemical beneficiation is possible<br>
by chemical leaching of mineral matter present in coal or, dissolving organic<br>
matter of coal in various organic solvents. As coal is a heterogeneous mixture of<br>
organic and inorganic constituents, the degree of solvolysis of coal varies with its<br>
constituents, maturity, and structural characteristics. Main advantages of the<br>
chemical beneficiation process are i) ease of recovery of solvent in the main<br>
process stream, ii) solvolytic efficiency of recovered solvents as that of fresh<br>
solvent, iii) 98-% recovery of the solvent, iv) improved coking properties of clean<br>
coal, and v) availability of industrial organic solvents. However, the operating<br>
cost of this process is high because of high cost of solvents and energy<br>
requirement in the process. There is an attempt to make this process techno-<br>
economic through improving the yield to 70-80%. However, further research<br>
may be required to make the process economically viable through reducing the<br>
cost of solvent recovery.<br><br>
Recovery of clean coal and its ash content depend on various operating<br>
parameters of the process and feed characteristics like faster and convenient<br>
filtration of refluxed solution at different size, solvent and co-solvent of choice,<br>
coal source (feed characteristics), particles size, coal-solvent ratio, extraction<br>
time, extraction temperature, etc. Thus, the process offers a balance between<br>
the yield and the ash contents desired in the clean coal.<br>
Since the mineral matter (non-combustible) in Indian coals (Gondwana coals) is<br>
very finely disseminated in the organic mass, it is quite difficult to remove the<br>
mineral matter by conventional physical coal washing techniques. High<br>
percentage of near gravity material in this coal, makes the scope of gravity<br>
process substantially limited. This indicate that chemical treatment may be the<br>
right approach to overcome the limitation of physical beneficiation methods. A lot<br>
of literature is available on chemical beneficiation techniques (US patent<br>
5955375, 21/09/1999) that employ high corrosive chemicals (mostly acids and<br>
alkalis). Recovery or regeneration of these chemicals is very important to make<br>
this technology viable. A parallel approach towards lowering ash, is the process<br>
of recovering the premium organic matter from coal by solvent refining.<br>
Literature (India 1088/KOL/2007) reveals that most of the research work on this<br>
subject was carried out with an objective to produce ultra clean coal or super<br>
clean coal with ash content less than 0.2% for various high tech end uses. This<br>
known solvent refining process does not serve the objective of low ash coal<br>
requirement of steel industries because of mainly low recovery which makes the<br>
process uneconomic especially when such an ultra coal is not absolutely desired<br>
at the cost of restricting to low yields.<br><br>
Patent literatures described solvent extraction (India 1292/KOL/2006, India<br>
1336/KOL/2008 techniques that employ expensive solvents. According to the<br>
existing process, coal, solvent and co-solvents are mixed thoroughly to produce<br>
coal slurry. The coal slurry is extracted in a known manner which includes coal-<br>
solvent mixture. The mixture is separated in a separation unit to produce a<br>
coarser fraction and a finer fraction. The finer fraction is fed to an evaporator<br>
unit to allow 70 to 80% of solvent recovery. The hot concentrated coal-solvent<br>
mixture is then flushed in a precipitation tank to precipitate the coal. Water as an<br>
anti-solvent is being used. Coal is precipitated and water-solvent mixture as<br>
obtained separated in a distillation column. Recovery or regeneration of these<br>
solvents and anti solvent are very important to make this technology viable.<br>
Conventionally solvent is recovered by hot precipitation of coal extracts in anti<br>
solvent, but there is no prior art available on cold precipitation. Therefore there<br>
is a need to propose a noble process to recover the solvent and anti solvent<br>
which is convenient and adapts cold precipitation.<br>
OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an object of the invention to propose an improved process to<br>
produce low ash clean coal from high ash coal.<br>
Another object of the invention is to produce an improved process to produce<br>
low ash clean coal from high ash coal, which adapts an economic and<br>
environment-friendly Anti-solvent suitable for industrial extraction of coal.<br><br>
A still another object of the invention is to propose an improved process to<br>
produce low ash clean coal from high ash coal, which is economic and<br>
environment-friendly.<br>
A further object of the invention is to propose an improved process to produce<br>
low ash clean coal from high ash coal, which provides better separation and<br>
ensures high recovery of solvents.<br>
A still further object of the invention is to propose an improved process to<br>
produce low ash clean coal from high ash coal, which provides better separation<br>
of extracted coal and solvent mixture.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to propose a system for producing low ash<br>
clean coal from high ash coal including high recovery of solvents.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, in a first aspect of the invention, there is provided An improved<br>
process to produce low ash coal from high ash coal, comprising the steps of<br>
forming a slurry of coal fines in a N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) including<br>
Ethylenediamine (EDA), NMP and EDA being between 6:1 to 24:1 solution, said<br>
slurry containing about 6 to 25 ml of solution per g of coal; maintaining said<br>
slurry in refluxed condition at a temperature of about 170 °C for a period of<br>
about 15 minutes to 2 hours;<br><br>
separating the refluxed solution in two parts by coarse filtration at 0.025 mm<br>
filter cloth a cut size of the separation being variable depending on the particle<br>
size filtrate, extract and residue to be treated; cooling the filtered coal-solvent<br>
mixture; precipitating the coal by adding acetone in the extract;; separating the<br>
coal by filtration, said coal having a reduced ash content; and recovering the rest<br>
of the solvent by distillation of the acetone-solvent solution.<br>
According to the invention, coal solvent and co-solvent are mixed thoroughly to<br>
produce a coal slurry. The coal slurry is extracted in a known manner which<br>
includes coal-solvent mixture. The mixture is separated in a separation unit to<br>
produce a coarser fraction and a finer fraction. The finer fraction is cooled in a<br>
jacketed vessel and not being fed to evaporation unit, thus this energy can be<br>
used for heating purpose in the process. The cooled extracted clean coal-solvent<br>
mixture is then flushed in a precipitation tank to precipitate the coal, where,<br>
Acetone as an anti-solvent is being used. Acetone separates the solvent from<br>
coal very effectively, and we get acetone-solvent mixture, which is easily<br>
separable at lower temperature in distillation unit, thus energy is being saved in<br>
distillation column too. And precipitated coal is separated in a rotary drum filter.<br>
The process is an economic and environment-friendly coal extraction process<br>
which is less energy intensive and economically viable. The invention process is<br>
enabled to produce low ash clean coal which provides better separation of<br>
extracted coal and solvent mixture.<br><br>
According to a second aspect of the invention, there is provided A system for<br>
producing low ash coal from high ash coal, comprising an extractor (1) enabled<br>
to received a coal-slurry produced by thoroughly mixing coal, solvent, and anti-<br>
solvent in a coal-solvent feed plant, temperature in the extractor (1) being<br>
gradually generated to about 200 °C, the residue time of the coal-solvent feed<br>
depending on the process parameters varies between 15 - minutes to 2-hours a<br>
first filter (2) for separating the extracted coal - solvent mixture into a coarser<br>
fraction called as a residue containing high ash , and a finer fraction known as<br>
the filtered extract; a cooler unit (3) for directly receiving the finer fraction; a<br>
precipitation tank (4) for receiving the cooled coal-solvent mixture in which the<br>
acetone acting as an anti-solvent gets the extracted coal separated from the<br>
coal-slurry solution for further precipitation; a second filter (5) for separating the<br>
precipitated coal to produce a clean coal; and a distillation unit (6) for receiving<br>
the filtrate containing solvent and anti-solvent solution to recover the solvent and<br>
the anti-solvent.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWING<br>
Figure - 1 - shows a system for producing low ash clean coal from high ash coal<br>
according to the invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
As shown in figure - 1, the inventive system comprises an Extractor (1); a first<br><br>
filter (2) enabled to separate solid-liquid upto size 500 mesh a cooler (3); a<br>
Precipitation tank (4); a second filter (5) enabled to completely separate solid-<br>
liquid; and a Distillation column (6).<br>
According to the invention, acetone has been identified as the anti-solvent for<br>
convenient, environmental friendly and economical industrial coal-solvent<br>
separation operation. The coal sample is refluxed with NMP and a small amount<br>
of co-solvent (EDA) for 1 h at atmospheric pressure. Then the refluxed mixture<br>
using 500 stainless steel BSS mesh (0.25 mm) cloth is filtered. This arrangement<br>
allowed a coarser and faster filtration at 0.25 mm size in comparison to that<br>
observed by using the known Whatman filter paper. Therefore, increase in yield<br>
of clean and simultaneously increase in ash content of clean coal, have been<br>
clearly established. Thus, the identified anti-solvent is found to be advantageous<br>
to produce high yield clean coal with low ash content (5-8%) through a faster<br>
filtration process.<br>
According to the invention, an improved process to produce low ash clean coal<br>
from high ash cola in the inventive system comprises a step of thoroughly mixing<br>
coal, solvent and co-solvent in a coal - solvent feed tank (not shown). The coal<br>
slurry is then pumped from the tank into the extractor (1). A temperature around<br>
170 - 200 °C is gradually generated in the extractor (1). Residence time in the<br>
extractor (1) may vary form 15 mins to 2 h and i.e. dictated by the techno<br>
economics of the process and its specific requirement. The extracted coal-solvent<br><br>
mixture is then separated through the first filter (2) which cut the mixture in two<br>
fractions for example, a coarser fraction (+0.25 mm), and a finer fraction (-0.025<br>
mm). The coarser fraction contains high ash and is called as residue. The finer<br>
fraction or filtered extract is then fed to the cooler unit (3) directly, bypassing the<br>
evaporator unit (3). The cooled coal-solvent mixture is flushed in thee<br>
precipitation tank (4), where the acetone acts as an anti-solvent. As the solvents<br>
are strongly soluble in Acetone, the extracted coal gets separated from the<br>
solution phase and gets precipitated. This precipitated coal is separated through<br>
the second filter (5). Thus, a clean coal is obtained which contains less than 4%<br>
ash. The filtrated coal slurry consists of solvent-anti solvent (Acetone) solution<br>
which is sent to a distillation unit (6) where the solvent and the anti-solvent are<br>
recovered after distillation.<br>
EXAMPLE<br>
A sample of 10 gm coal, having - 30 mesh sizes and 27% ash content, is<br>
extracted, using NMP and EDA as a solvent and co-solvent respectively for one<br>
hour. Filtration is done through a 500 stainless steel BSS mesh (0.025 mm).<br>
Precipitation is thereafter separately done in water and acetone. An analysis is<br>
done for clean coal and residue both the clean obtained through extraction and<br>
filtration.<br>
As interesting phenomenon is observed when the acetone is used as the anti-<br>
solvent. For example, if the hot filtered coal-solvent mixture is poured in the<br><br>
precipitation tank, then the coal is not agglomerated, and further the separation<br>
of coal-solvent is poor. In contrast, if a filtered coal-solvent is properly mixed<br>
acetone. Comparative study of precipitation in water and precipitation in acetone<br>
is shown in table 1.<br><br>
Table 1 shows that precipitation in water gives less yield, i.e. 35% while<br>
precipitation in acetone gives higher yield, i.e., 43.45% of clean coal. Ash<br>
content of such an experimentation establishes that acetone is better anti-<br>
solvent than water, in terms of yield and in terms of saving of energy mainly<br>
because of low boiling point of the acetone,<br><br>
