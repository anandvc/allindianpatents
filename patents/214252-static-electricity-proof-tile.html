				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a static-electrity proof<br>
tile, and more particularly to a static-electrity proof tile<br>
employing a carbon firm. Static-electrity proof tiles according<br>
to the present invention may be laid on floors upon which electric<br>
or electronic appliances such as semiconductor devices are<br>
assembled, floors of laboratories, cleaning rooms, and operating<br>
rooms of a hospital, floors of offices which are apt to be<br>
influenced by harmful electromagnetic waves, etc., to absorb or<br>
drain static electricity.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
There exist various conventional static-electricity proof<br>
tiles (which are also called "static-proof mats" or "static-<br>
proof sheets" and will be referred to simply as "static-electrity<br>
proof tiles" hereinafter).<br>
In manufacturing the conventional static-electrity proof<br>
tiles, powders of conductive metals, such as copper, gold, and<br>
silver, may be applied onto or permeated into surfaces of the<br>
tiles, or a surface active agent may be mixed in the tiles while<br>
the tiles are formed, or carbon may be inputted to and mixed with<br>
materials of synthetic resin or rubber before the tiles are<br>
completed.<br>
From among the conventional static-electrity proof tiles,<br>
the present invention relates to a static-electrity proof tile<br>
manufactured by utilizing carbon.<br>
The conventional static-electrity proof tiles utilizing carbon<br>
include not only typical carbon tiles, which are manufactured by<br>
rolling tile preforms which are mixtures of carbon and synthetic<br>
resin, but also special carbon tiles such as those disclosed in<br>
US Patents Nos.4,208,696 and 4,803,112.<br>
US Patent No.4,208,696 employs a method, in which a mat is<br>
formed by coating a carbon layer on a surface of each granule<br>
made from synthetic resin and then compressing the coated granules<br>
in a mold, so as to reduce the quantity of added carbon.US Patent<br>
No.4,803,112 is an improvement of US Patent No.4,208,696 provides<br>
a static-electrity proof tile manufactured by a method, in which<br>
a conductive tile<br><br>
manufactured by the method according to US Patent No, 4,208e, 696,:<br>
 is sliced into pieces having a thickness of about 1 mm, an intermediate<br>
layer is attached to a lower surface of each piece, a soft rubber sheet is attached to a<br>
lower surface of the intermediate layer, and then the three layers are fused to each<br>
other by heat.<br>
However, the conventional conductive tiles or static-proof tiles utilizing<br>
carbon have the following problems which require solution.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
First, in the case of the conductive tile manufactured by mixing carbon in<br>
advance with synthetic resin, the completed tile has a very soft surface which makes<br>
it difficult to employ the completed tile as a floor plate. In particular, this<br>
conductive tile may be dug or scratched by soles of shoes, etc., and is thus improper<br>
as a floor plate.<br>
Second, when a surface of the conductive tile manufactured according to<br>
the conventional method in which carbon is mixed in advance with synthetic resin<br>
is rubbed by another object, the rubbing object may be smeared and thus<br>
contaminated by the carbon.<br>
Third, the static-proof tile manufactured by coating a carbon layer on a<br>
surface of each granule and then compressing the coated granules inevitably has<br>
portions with discontinuities, so that static electricity may be generated in the static-<br>
proof tile.<br>
Fourth, the conventional methods include complicated manufacturing steps,<br>
such as a step of coating granules made from synthetic resin, thereby requiring a<br>
large manufacturing cost.<br>
Fifth, hardly any tiles have been developed, winch not only can prevent<br>
generation of static electricity but also can shield electromagnetic waves and water<br>
vein waves<br>
Therefore, the present invention has been made in order to overcome the<br>
above-mentioned problems of the prior art, and it is a first object of the present<br>
invention to provide a static-proof tile utilizing carbon, which has a large surface<br>
stiffness, from a surface of which the carbon is not smeared onto an object rubbing<br>
the surface, which has a uniform static-proof effect, and which can be<br>
manufactured at a small cost.<br>
It is a second object of the present invention to provide a<br>
static-electrity proof tile utilizing carbon, which can decrease<br>
static electricity and shield electromagnetic waves and water<br>
vein waves.<br>
According to this invention there is provided a static-<br>
electricity proof tile comprising -<br>
a tile substrate made from synthetic resin;<br>
a colour-printed film made from synthetic resin and attached<br>
to an upper surface of the tile substrate;<br>
a transparent film made from synthetic resin and attached to<br>
an upper surface of the coloured printed film, and<br>
a carbon film attached to a lower surface of the tile<br>
substrate, the said carbon film having a thickness smaller than<br>
that of said tile substrate, wherein at least one thin<br>
electroconductive layer utilizing carbon is formed under a<br>
transparent film located at the uppermost layer and made from<br>
non-conductive material, thereby resulting in a tile having<br>
large surface stiffness and preventing carbon from being detached<br>
from the said tile.<br>
It is preferred that another carbon film is attached to a<br>
lower surface of the tile substrate.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, there<br>
is provided a static-electrity proof tile comprising : a tile<br>
substrate made from synthetic resin ; a color-printed film made<br>
from synthetic resin and attached to an upper surface of the tile<br>
substrate ; a transparent film made from synthetic resin and<br>
attached to an upper surface of the color-printed film ; and a<br>
metal sheet attached to a lower surface of the tile substrate,<br>
the metal sheet having a thickness smaller than that of the tile<br>
substrate, the metal sheet containing or being coated with metal.<br>
It is preferred that the metal sheet has at least one carbon<br>
coat coated on one surface or both surfaces of the metal sheet,<br>
the carbon coat having a thickness smaller than that of the tile<br>
substrate.<br>
According to still another aspect of the present invention,<br>
there is provided a static-electrity proof tile comprising : a<br>
tile substrate made from synthetic resin ; a color-printed film<br>
made from synthetic resin and attached to an upper surface of the<br>
tile substrate ; a transparent film made from synthetic resin and<br>
attached to an upper surface of the color-printed film ; and a<br>
carbon coat formed on a lower surface of the color-printed film<br>
by printing or coating carbon thereon.<br>
In the case in which a carbon coat is formed on a lower<br>
surface of the color-printed film, it is also preferred that a<br>
carbon film is formed under the tile substrate, the carbon film<br>
having a thickness smaller than that of the tile substrate.<br>

FIG. 3A is an exploded perspective view of a static-proof tile according to<br>
the third embodiment of the present invention; and<br>
FIG. 3B is an enlarged sectional view of the static-proof tile shown in FIG.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the<br>
present invention.<br>
FIG. 1A is an exploded perspective view of a static-proof tile according to<br>
the first embodiment of the present invention, and FIG. iB is an enlarged sectional<br>
view of the static-proof tile shown in FIG. 1 A, in a state in which films of the tile<br>
have been attached to each other.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1 A, a typical tile made from synthetic resin includes only<br>
a transparent film 50 disposed at the uppermost layer, a color-printed film 40<br>
disposed under the transparent film 50, and a tile substrate 30 disposed under the<br>
color-printed film 40, each of which is made from non-conductive synthetic resin<br>
having an electric resistance of at least 1014 D/cm2. A synthetic resin tile having<br>
such a typical construction as described above can have a surface layer with a high<br>
stiffness and allows various colors or shapes to be printed in its color-printed film,<br>
thereby having an excellent marketability. However, this typical tile is<br>
disadvantageous in that it has no ability to prevent generation of static electricity.<br>
The present invention provides a tile which has an excellent static-proof effect as<br>
well as having all the characteristics of the typical tile having the construction<br>
described above.<br>
That is, a static-proof tile according to the present invention is characterized<br>
in that at least one thin electro-conductive layer utilizing carbon is formed under a<br>
transparent film 50 which is located at the uppermost layer and made from non-<br>
conductive material. This construction enables realization of a static-proof tile<br>
which has a large surface stiffness and can prevent the carbon from being detached<br>
from the tile.<br>
Referring again to FIGs. 1A and 1B, a conductive or static-proof tile<br>
includes a transparent film 50 located at the uppermost layer, a color-printed film<br>
40 located directly under the transparent film 50, a first carbon film 10 located<br>
directly under the color-printed film 40, a tile substrate 30 located directly under<br>
the first carbon film 10, and a second carbon film 20 located directly under the tile<br>
substrate 30.<br>
Herein, it is preferred that, the transparent film 50 has a thickness of about<br>
0.3 mm, the color-printed film 40 has a thickness of about 0.1 mm, each of the first<br>
and second carbon films 10 and 20 has a thickness of about 0.1 mm, and the tile<br>
substrate 30 has a thickness of about 2.4 mm, so that the entire tile has a thickness<br>
of about 3 mm. Those films described the above are fo;med integrally with each<br>
other by heating and rolling them to each other by means of a hot roller.<br>
It is preferred that each of the first and second carbon films 10 and 20<br>
includes a synthetic resin film 11 or 21 and a carbon coat 12 or 22 formed by<br>
coating or printing carbon on one surface or both surfaces of the synthetic resin<br>
film 11 or 21. FIG. 1A shows examples of carbon coats each of which is formed<br>
on only one surface of each of the synthetic resin film.<br>
The construction described above enables a static-proof tile utilizing<br>
carbon to have a uniform static-proof effect and to be manufactured by a simple<br>
process and small cost.<br>
As the carbon film described above, an electro-conductive film formed by-<br>
heating and compressing a synthetic resin material containing carbon may be<br>
employed. The carbon film formed in this way is advantageous in the aspect of its<br>
effect but is disadvantageous in the aspect of its manufacturing cost.<br>
At least one of the tile substrate 30 and the color-printed film 40 may<br>
further contain a surface active agent. This construction is suitable for a tile to be.<br>
used in a place in which static electricity is frequently generated or a large quantity<br>
of static electricity is generated.<br>
In a tile used in an environment in which there is not generated so much<br>
static electricity, the second carbon film 20 directly under the tile substrate 30 may<br>
be omitted.<br>
It has been confirmed that the electric resistance of the surface of the<br>
transparent film 50 decreases below 1013 O/cm2 due to the tunneling effect when<br>
the first carbon film 10 having a surface resistance of at most 106 O/cm2 is attached<br>
to the lower surface of the transparent film 50 which is made from non-conductive<br>
material. In practice, it has been known that a tile has a sufficient static-proof<br>
effect when the tile has a surface resistance of 1013 O/cm2. For reference, an anti-<br>
static grade according to the U.S. military specifications has a range from 10<br>
O/cm2 to 1014 O/cm2.<br>
FIG. 2A is an exploded perspective view of a static-proof tile according to<br>
the second embodiment of the present invention, and FIG. 2B is an enlarged<br>
sectional view of the static-proof tile shown in FIG. 2A, in a state in which films of<br>
the tile have been attached to each other.<br>
The second embodiment is different from the first embodiment in that no<br>
separate carbon film is attached to the lower surface of the color-printed film 40<br>
but the lower surface of the color-printed film 40 is directly coated with a carbon<br>
coat 42.<br>
That is, a color-printed layer 43 is formed on the upper surface of a<br>
synthetic resin film 41, and the carbon coat 42 is coated on the lower surface of the<br>
synthetic resin film 41. Herein, the carbon coat may be formed by coating or<br>
printing carbon on the lower surface of the synthetic resin film 41.<br>
The same description of the corresponding construction of the first<br>
embodiment may be given to the other construction of the second embodiment.<br>
FIG. 3 A is an exploded perspective view of a static-proof tile according to<br>
the third embodiment of the present invention, and FIG. 3B is an enlarged sectional<br>
view of the static-proof tile shown in FIG. 3A, in a state in which the film<br>
components of the tile have been attached to each other.<br>
The third embodiment is different from the first embodiment in that a<br>
metal sheet 60 having a thickness smaller than that of the tile substrate 30 instead<br>
of a carbon film is attached to the lower surface of the tile substrate 30.<br>
The metal sheet 60 may be a conductive sheet, made of one of nickel,<br>
copper, silver, gold, kalium, magnesium, cadmium, aluminum, zinc, and tungsten.<br>
The metal sheet 60 is a medium having a Conductivity between 1 x 10 and<br>
6.17 x 10 S/m, through which electricity passes well.<br><br>
resistance of at most 1012 O/cm2 is attached to the lower surface of the transparent<br>
film 50 which is a non-conductor, the electric resistance of the surface of the<br>
transparent film 50 decreases below 1012 Q/cm due to a tunneling effect.<br>
Therefore, the tile according to the present invention can decrease the static<br>
electricity on the surface of the tile.<br>
Further, the metal sheet 60 is made of metal which is non-magnetic and has .<br>
a high conductivity, so that the employment of the metal sheet 60 can be very<br>
useful in shielding electromagnetic waves and low-frequency waves such as water<br>
vein waves. The water vein waves, which cannot pass through the metal sheet 60,<br>
finally change into eddy currents and are thus collected at comers of the metal<br>
sheet. Then, the metal sheet discharges the collected current to a ground, like a<br>
grounding pole. In this way, the metal sheet can shield the water vein waves as<br>
well as the electromagnetic waves.<br>
Further, it is preferred that the metal sheet 60 is manufactured in a shape of<br>
a thin plate in consideration of the fact that the metal sheet 60 is heavier and more<br>
expensive than other conductive materials. Preferably, the metal sheet 60 may<br>
have a thickness of 0.05 to 0.1 mm.<br>
Further, a carbon coat of 0.1 mm may be formed on one surface or both<br>
surfaces of the thin metal sheet. This carbon coat can decrease the static<br>
electricity as described in the first embodiment, and the thin metal plate can shield<br>
the electromagnetic waves and water vein waves.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
As can be seen from the foregoing, the present invention provides a static-<br>
proof tile utilizing carbon, which has a large surface stiffness, from a surface of<br>
which the carbon is not detached, which has a uniform static-proof effect, which<br>
can be manufactured at a small cost, and which can shield electromagnetic waves<br>
and water vein waves.<br>
While this invention has been described in connection with what is<br>
presently considered to be the most practical and preferred embodiment, it is to be<br>
understood that the invention is not limited to the disclosed embodiment and the<br>

the conventional method of making such tiles, carbon mixed with<br>
synthetic resin when rubbed with another object, gets smeared and<br>
contaminated with carbon. Granules of synthetic resin coated<br>
with carbon invariably have discontinuities, resulting in<br>
generation of statical electricity,and inability to shield<br>
electromagnetic waves and water vein waves. Moreover, the<br>
conventional method(s) involves considerable manufacturing cost.<br>

substrate (30), the said carbon film having a thickness smaller<br>
than that of said tile substrate,<br>
wherein at least one thin electroconductive layer utilizing<br>
