				<td>A GLUCOCORTICOSTEROID OF ANDROSTANE SERIES AND COMPOSITION <br>
COMPRISING IT<br>
The present invention relates to a compound which is a glucocorticoid receptor<br>
agonist of the androstane series. The present invention also relates to<br>
pharmaceutical formulations containing the compound and to therapeutic uses<br>
thereof, particularly for the treatment of inflammatory and allergic conditions.<br>
Glucocorticosteroids which have anti-inflammatory properties are known and are<br>
widely used for the treatment of inflammatory disorders or diseases such as asthma<br>
and rhinitis. However, we have identified a novel glucocorticosteroid.<br>
Thus, according to one aspect of the invention, there is provided a compound of<br>
formula (I)<br><br>
or a physiologically acceptable solvate thereof.<br>
Examples of solvates include hydrates.<br>
References hereinafter to the compound according to the invention includes both<br>
compound of formula (I) and solvates thereof.<br>
It will be appreciated that the invention includes within its scope all stereoisomers of<br>
the compound of formula (I) and mixtures thereof.<br>
Preferably, the absolute stereochemistry will be as shown in the representation of<br>
compound of formula (I).<br>
The compound of formula (I) is named:<br>
6a,9a-Difluoro-11ß-hydroxy-16a-methyl-3-oxo-17a-(2,2,3,3-<br>
tetramethycyclopropylcarbonyl)oxy-androsta-1,4-diene-17ß-carboxylic acid<br>
cyanomethyl ester.<br>
The compound of formula (I) has potentially beneficial anti-inflammatory or anti-<br>
allergic effects, particularly upon topical administration, demonstrated by, for<br>
example, its ability to bind to the glucocorticoid receptor and to illicit a response via<br>
that receptor. Hence, the compound of formula (I) is potentially useful in the<br>
treatment of inflammatory and/or allergic disorders.<br>
Examples of disease states in which the compound of the invention may have utility<br>
include skin diseases such as eczema, psoriasis, allergic dermatitis neurodermatitis,<br>
pruritis and hypersensitivity reactions; inflammatory conditions of the nose, throat or<br>
lungs such as asthma (including allergen-induced asthmatic reactions), rhinitis<br>
(including hayfever), nasal polyps, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, interstitial<br>
lung disease, and fibrosis; inflammatory bowel conditions such as ulcerative colitis<br>
and Crohn's disease; and auto-immune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis.<br>
The compound of the invention may also have use in the treatment of conjunctiva<br>
and conjunctivitis.<br>
It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that reference herein to treatment<br>
extends to prophylaxis as well as the treatment of established conditions.<br>
As mentioned above, the compound of formula (I) may be useful in human or<br>
veterinary medicine, in particular as an anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic agent.<br>
There is thus provided as a further aspect of the invention a compound of formula (I)<br>
or a physiologically acceptable solvate thereof for use in human or veterinary<br>
medicine, particularly in the treatment of patients with inflammatory and/or allergic<br>
conditions.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided the use of a<br>
compound of formula (I) or a physiologically acceptable solvate thereof for the<br>
manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of patients with inflammatory and/or<br>
allergic conditions.<br>
In a further or alternative aspect, there is provided a method for the treatment of a<br>
human or animal subject with an inflammatory and/or allergic condition, which<br>
method comprises administering to said human or animal subject an effective<br>
amount of a compound of formula (I) or physiologically acceptable solvate thereof.<br>
WO 02/00679A that represents most relevant state of the art describes compounds of formula<br>
(A)<br><br>
where R is a monovalent cyclic organic group having 3 to 15 atoms in the ring system, their<br>
preparation and their use as Pharmaceuticals.<br>
The said document discloses (cf. examples 14, 24 andclaim 1) a steroid from which the<br>
compound of the present invention differs in that cyano-ester on position 17 of ring system<br>
instead of methyl-ester. Beside this, other structural features are also different.<br>
The problem to be solved by the present invention may therefore be regarded as to provide a<br>
novel steriod useful an anti-inflammatory.<br>
The compound according to the invention may be formulated for administration in<br>
any convenient way, and the invention therefore also includes within its scope<br>
pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of formula (I) or<br>
physiologically acceptable solvate thereof together, if desirable, in admixture with<br>
one or more physiologically acceptable diluents or carriers.<br>
Further, there is provided a process for the preparation of such pharmaceutical<br>
compositions which comprises mixing the ingredients.<br>
The compound according to the invention may, for example, be formulated for oral,<br>
buccal, sublingual, parenteral, local or rectal administration, especially local<br>
administration.<br>
Local administration as used herein, includes administration by insufflation and<br>
inhalation. Examples of various types of preparation for local administration include<br>
ointments, lotions, creams, gels, foams, preparations for delivery by transdermal<br>
patches, powders, sprays, aerosols, capsules or cartridges for use in an inhaler or<br>
insufflator or drops (e.g. eye or nose drops), solutions/suspensions for nebulisation,<br>
suppositories, pessaries, retention enemas and chewable or suckable tablets or<br>
pellets (e.g. for the treatment of aphthous ulcers) or liposome or microencapsulation<br>
preparations.<br>
Ointments, creams and gels, may, for example, be formulated with an aqueous or<br>
oily base with the addition of suitable thickening and/or gelling agent and/or solvents.<br>
Such bases may thus, for example, include water and/or an oil such as liquid paraffin<br>
or a vegetable oil such as arachis oil or castor oil, or a solvent such as polyethylene<br>
glycol. Thickening agents and gelling agents which may be used according to the<br>
nature of the base include soft paraffin, aluminium stearate, cetostearyl alcohol,<br>
polyethylene glycols, woolfat, beeswax, carboxypolymethylene and cellulose<br>
derivatives, and/or glyceryl monostearate and/or non-ionic emulsifying agents.<br>
Lotions may be formulated with an aqueous or oily base and will in general also<br>
contain one or more emulsifying agents, stabilising agents, dispersing agents,<br>
suspending agents or thickening agents.<br>
Powders for external application may be formed with the aid of any suitable powder<br>
base, for example, talc, lactose or starch. Drops may be formulated with an<br>
aqueous or non-aqueous base also comprising one or more dispersing agents,<br>
solubilising agents, suspending agents or preservatives.<br>
Spray compositions may for example be formulated as aqueous solutions or<br>
suspensions or as aerosols delivered from pressurised packs, such as a metered<br>
dose inhaler, with the use of a suitable liquefied propellant. Aerosol compositions<br>
suitable for inhalation can be either a suspension or a solution and generally contain<br>
a compound of formula (I) and a suitable propellant such as a fluorocarbon or<br>
hydrogen-containing chlorofluorocarbon or mixtures thereof, particularly<br>
hydrofluoroalkanes, especially 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane, 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoro-n-<br>
propane or a mixture thereof. The aerosol composition may optionally contain<br>
additional formulation excipients well known in the art such as surfactants e.g. oleic<br>
acid or lecithin and cosolvents e.g. ethanol.<br>
Advantageously, the formulations of the invention may be buffered by the addition of<br>
suitable buffering agents.<br>
Capsules and cartridges for use in an inhaler or insufflator, of for example gelatine,<br>
may be formulated containing a powder mix for inhalation of a compound of the<br>
invention and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch. Each capsule or<br>
cartridge may generally contain between 20µg-10mg of the compound of formula (I).<br>
Alternatively, the compound of the invention may be presented without excipients<br>
such as lactose.<br>
The proportion of the active compound of formula (I) in the local compositions<br>
according to the invention depends on the precise type of formulation to be prepared<br>
but will generally be within the range of from 0.001 to 10% by weight. Generally,<br>
however for most types of preparations advantageously the proportion used will be<br>
within the range of from 0.005 to 1% and preferably 0.01 to 0.5%. However, in<br>
powders for inhalation or insufflation the proportion used will be within the range of<br>
from 0.1 to 5%.<br>
Aerosol formulations are preferably arranged so that each metered dose or "puff" of<br>
aerosol contains 20µg-2000µg, preferably about 20µg-500µg of a compound of<br>
formula (I). Administration may be once daily or several times daily, for example 2,<br>
3, 4 or 8 times, giving for example 1, 2 or 3 doses each time. The overall daily dose<br>
with an aerosol will be within the range 100µg-10mg preferably, 200µg-2000µg. The<br>
overall daily dose and the metered dose delivered by capsules and cartridges in an<br>
inhaler or insufflator will generally be double those with aerosol formulations.<br>
Topical preparations may be administered by one or more applications per day to the<br>
affected area; over skin areas occlusive dressings may advantageously be used.<br>
Continuous or prolonged delivery may be achieved by an adhesive reservoir system.<br>
For internal administration the compounds according to the invention may, for<br>
example, be formulated in conventional manner for oral, parenteral or rectal<br>
administration. Formulations for oral administration include syrups, elixirs, powders,<br>
granules, tablets and capsules which typically contain conventional excipients such<br>
as binding agents, fillers, lubricants, disintegrants, wetting agents, suspending<br>
agents, emulsifying agents, preservatives, buffer salts, flavouring, colouring and/or<br>
sweetening agents as appropriate. Dosage unit forms are, however, preferred as<br>
described below.<br>
Preferred forms of preparation for internal administration are dosage unit forms i.e.<br>
tablets and capsules. Such dosage unit forms contain from 0.1 mg to 20mg<br>
preferably from 2.5 to 10mg of the compounds of the invention.<br>
The compound according to the invention may in general may be given by internal<br>
administration in cases where systemic adreno-cortical therapy is indicated.<br>
In general terms preparations, for internal administration may contain from 0.05 to<br>
10% of the active ingredient dependent upon the type of preparation, involved. The<br>
daily dose may vary from 0.1 mg to 60mg, e.g. 5-30mg, dependent on the condition<br>
being treated, and the duration of treatment desired.<br>
Slow release or enteric coated formulations may be advantageous, particularly for<br>
the treatment of inflammatory bowel disorders.<br>
The compound and pharmaceutical formulations according to the invention may be<br>
used in combination with or include one or more other therapeutic agents, for<br>
example selected from anti-inflammatory agents, anticholinergic agents (particularly<br>
an M1/M2/M3 receptor antagonist), ß2-adrenoreceptor agonists, antiinfective agents<br>
(e.g. antibiotics, antivirals), or antihistamines. The invention thus provides, in a<br>
further aspect, a combination comprising a compound of formula (I) or a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate or physiologically functional derivative<br>
thereof together with one or more other therapeutically active agents, for example<br>
selected from an anti-inflammatory agent (for example another corticosteroid or an<br>
NSAID), an anticholinergic agent, a ß2-adrenoreceptor agonist, an antiinfective agent<br>
(e.g. an antibiotic or an antiviral), or an antihistamine. Preferred are combinations<br>
comprising a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate<br>
or physiologically functional derivative thereof together with a ß2-adrenoreceptor<br>
agonist, and/or an anticholinergic, and/or a PDE-4 inhibitor. Preferred combinations<br>
are those comprising one or two other therapeutic agents.<br>
It will be clear to a person skilled in the art that, where appropriate, the other<br>
therapeutic ingredient(s) may be used in the form of salts, (e.g. as alkali metal or<br>
amine salts or as acid addition salts), or prodrugs, or as esters (e.g. lower alkyl<br>
esters), or as solvates (e.g. hydrates) to optimise the activity and/or stability and/or<br>
physical characteristics (e.g. solubility) of the therapeutic ingredient. It will be clear<br>
also that where appropriate, the therapeutic ingredients may be used in optically<br>
pure form.<br>
A combination comprising of compound of the invention together with a<br>
ß2-adrenoreceptor agonist is particularly preferred.<br>
Examples of ß2-adrenoreceptor agonists include salmeterol (e.g. as racemate or a<br>
single enantiomer such as the R-enantiomer), salbutamol, formoterol, salmefamol,<br>
fenoterol or terbutaline and salts thereof, for example the xinafoate salt of<br>
salmeterol, the sulphate salt or free base of salbutamol or the fumarate salt of<br>
formoterol. Long-acting ß2-adrenoreceptor agonists are preferred, especially those<br>
having a therapeutic effect over a 24 hour period such as salmeterol or formoterol.<br>

Pharmacological Activity<br>
Pharmacological activity may be assessed in functional in vitro assays of<br>
glucocorticoid agonist activity.<br>
The functional assay based on that described by K.P.Ray et al., Biochem J. (1997),<br>
328, 707-715 provides a measure of transrepressive activity of a glucocorticoid<br>
agonist. A549 cells stably transfected with a reporter gene containing the NF-kB<br>
responsive elements from the ELAM gene promoter coupled to sPAP (secreted<br>
alkaline phosphatase) are treated with test compounds at appropriate doses for 1<br>
hour at 37°C. The cells are then stimulated with tumour necrosis factor (TNF,<br>
10ng/ml) for 16 hours, at which time the amount of alkaline phosphatase produced is<br>
measured by a standard colourimetric assay. Dose response curves are constructed<br>
from which EC50 values may be estimated.<br>

The functional assay based on that described by R.J.H. Austin et al.. Eur Resp J.<br>
(2002), 20,1386-1392 measures the ability of compounds to directly transactivate<br>
gene expression. A549 cells stably transfected with a reporter gene containing the<br>
glucocorticoid responsive region of the mouse mammary tumour virus long terminal<br>
repeat (MMTV-LTR) coupled to renilla luciferase were treated with test compounds<br>
at appropriate doses for 6 hour at 37°C. The amount of luciferase activity present<br>
within the cells is then determined by measuring the light emitted following incubation<br>
with a suitable substrate. Dose response curves were constructed from which EC50<br>
values were estimated and from which maximal responses are calculated relative to<br>
Dexamethasone (100%).<br>

The human breast cancer cell line T47D has been reported to upregulate an<br>
endogenous alkaline phosphatase in response to progestins (Di Lorenzo et al..<br>
Cancer Research (1991) 51, 4470-4475. T47D cells were seeded into 96 well plates<br>
at a density of 1x105 cells per well and grown overnight at 37°C. Steroids were<br>
dissolved in DMSO, added to the cells (final DMSO concentration 0.7%), and<br>
incubated for 24 hours at 37°C. The cells were then washed with PBS and lysed with<br>
RIPA buffer (1% IGEPAL, 0.5% Na deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS in phosphate buffered<br>
saline). Alkaline phosphatase activity was measured spectrophotometrically (405nm)<br>
using p-nitrophenylphosphate (1.5mg/ml) as a substrate dissolved in 1M<br>
diethanolamine, 0.28M NaCI, 0.5mM MgCI2. Dose response curves were constructed<br>
from which EC50 values were estimated.<br>
