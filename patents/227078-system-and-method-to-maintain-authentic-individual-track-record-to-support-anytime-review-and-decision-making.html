TITLE: Device and method for Instant hiring of human resources. HR ATM-AnyTlme Manpower.<br>
FIELD OP THE INVENTION<br>
This Invention relates to a device and method for Instant hiring of human resources.<br>
HR ATM - Any Him Manpower device for Instant hiring of human resources, that meets distributed hiring requirements of the users, irrespective of the location the candidate or the recruiter Is based at<br>
This device provides Instant, Anytime, Anywhere, Any Job seeker - access to open Job positions or a recruiter access to potential manpower.The device is designed to provide instant hiring facility supporting activities like, recruiters publishing the manpower needs, candidates Identifying open positions, submission of resumes, short listings, tests, Interviews, creating audio-visual Performance Records, education verifications, employment verifications, performance verifications, reference checks, compensation management, work flow, Instant work flow approvals, online presentations, document sharing and exchange, release of offers, acceptance of offers and candidate printing the offer, and access to the offered employees portal, all happening In one sitting irrespective of the location or country the candidate or recruiter Is based at.<br>
The key to completion of the whole recruitment process In one sitting Is the facility provided by the device to create audiovisual records called Performance Records and the Instant verifications of education, employment, performance, and references using Performance Records.<br>
One of the driving force of this device Is to provide equal employment opportunity and access for those In rural areas.<br>
In order for the HR ATM to be Implemented, there Is a need for the Any Time Manpower Network (ATM Network) to be deployed across corporates, institutes, net cafes, consultants offices and other recruitment service providers. Does our country have a network of such devices? NO! This being proof that the device Is novel and unique.<br>
Kindly read on to know more about the novelty, uniqueness and usefulness of HR ATM that will redefine recruitment and provide solutions to issues faced in the current scenario.<br>
STATE OF THE ART IN THE FIELD<br>
Any person who Is aware of the recruitment process will agree with the fact that the process of recruitment Includes education, employment, performance and reference verifications without which the process is incomplete.<br>
The applicant Is not aware of devices for Instant hiring for a distributed talent pool environment with Instant education, career, performance and reference history verification<br>
Following are the known devices used In the current scenario mostly for audio-visual communication.<br>
1 .Video conferencing and edusat networks: Few corporates have been using video conferencing and edusat network to interview candidates. Here, the candidate Is asked to come to one corporate location and Is Interviewed by the recruiter who Is In another location. Video conferencing machine is only a tool for audio-visual communication and does not have the features for instant hiring as specified for HR ATM.<br>
2. Recruitment Mosk where a candidate can go to take a test, and the test score Is saved In a database along with scanned copies of documents pertaining to the candidate.These scores are later accessed by various recruiters who shortlist based on scores and then these candidates are called for Intervlew.This does not come In the purview of Instant hiring.<br><br>
3.TWo computers that has web camera: This Is similar to video conferencing since web camera Is only a audio-visual communication tool.The two computers serve as mode for display and means for using the web camera for web based audio-visual exchange and does not have the features for Instant hiring as specified for HR ATM like, Performance Records for Instant employment verification, and muiti location interview panels based decision-making.<br>
4. Recruitment software: Most recruitment software provide features like resource planning, Identifying and publishing of manpower requirement, posting of resume, candidate search, short listing, scheduling of interviews and test, updating evaluation sheets,compensation fixation,creating offer letters,and dispatch of offer.This is a muiti stage process spanning over many days or weeks especially since reference and employment verification taking time.<br>
As mentioned earlier the whole process of recruitment Is incomplete until and unless a device provides Instant verification also. None of the above mentioned provide instant verification feature. The inventor has not known of any existing instant hiring machine.<br>
The HR ATM Is developed using many Inter-dependent components which work together In an Interdependent manner to meet distributed hiring requirements of the users. Since the HR ATM network is deployed on the wide area network using the Internet usage of computers as one of the components, becomes a necessity.<br>
OBJECT OP THE INVENTION (PROBLEMS AND SOLUTION)<br>
HR ATM Is a device and method for instant hiring of human resources that meets distributed hiring requirements of the users, irrespective of the location the candidate or the recruiter is based at, comprising of such multiple devices that are networked on the wide area network with each device working according to a pre-defined sequential recruitment process and using audio-visual records called Performance Records, provided to the recruiter for Instant decision-making. Each device In turn constituted of multiple Inter-dependent components to help complete the recruitment process In one sitting.<br>
The device Is developed using inter-dependent components which work together In an Interdependent manner to meet distributed hiring requirements of the users. For example, the monitor is required to view information, the front end software program and database are used to receive Input and store data, the central processing unit Is needed to analyze the Inputs provided by the front end software program, the workflow automation component is required to sent and receive approvals and information, custom designed audio-visual component Is used to support audio-visual exchange and the audio-visual records are required for instant verifications^ document exchange tool to exchange documents and information between the users, the compensation management computer program helps decide the compensation, the printer helps In printing the offer letter and all working together in an inter-dependent manner to form the complete device.<br>
This device 1$ futuristic In nature since It utilizes audio-visual Performance Records, Performance Records of each candidate Is built by recording of every important events in audio-visual format For example, a school leaving certificate, a college degree, a reward certificate, a relieving order, employment certificate etc There will be a unique id on the hard copy, the audio-visual Performance Records and an entry In the database as updated by the person who releases the documents pertaining to the candidate. With this unique feature the recruiter can see the event and also verify the hardcopy and compare with the data updated in the database.This provides a three way verification support and becomes highly fool proof.<br>
WHY FUTURISTIC<br>
Currently all events of candidates are In the form of hard copies.This will be replaced by Performance Records In the future. A combination of audio-visual, hard copies and database verification, which cannot be forged will be implemented in organizations that choose to implement HR ATM .The device is designed to record the Performance Records of candidates. At the same time, the device provides the critical feature of instant verifications so as to complete the recruitment process.<br>
THE CURRENT PROCESS<br>
The current recruitment process involves, identifying the right talent pool, Informing the talent pool about the open positions, sourcing of resumes, short listing, call letter, testing, interview, approvals, document exchange, verifications, compensation fixation, and offer release. Completion of all these steps currently takes time. Recruiters also face many problems in the current sceneario.<br><br>

employee portal to the candidate<br>
?	The database stores the data at every step, on the Instruction of the front-end program.<br>
Details of Invention<br>
As mentioned earlier, a network of HR ATM Machines supports the distributed hiring process The HR ATM Machine supports audio-visual exchange, which means that the interviewers and the candidate can see each other irrespective of the locatlon.This network Is Installed for - Corporates, Institutes, Consultants, Job portals. Net cafes and other service providers to support the process implementation, which forms the primary backbone that helps to complete the whole recruitment process In one sitting, I.e., listing of opportunities, to submission of profile, short listing, to testing, verifications, document exchange, compensation management, release of offer, acceptance of offer, to printing of offer by the candidate and also providing access to that corporates offered employee portal, all happening in one sitting, In a distributed recruitment environment.<br><br><br>
Method of performing<br>
The device Is developed to follow a pre defined sequential recruitment process comprises of the following steps<br>
?	Candidate submits the short profile, if the candidate initiates the process. Recruiter submits the job specification,<br>
where the recruiter initiates the process.<br>
?	In both the above situation, the device completes the auto short listing of organizations, In case the candidate Initiates<br>
the process, or auto shortlists candidates if the recruiter initiates the process.The candidate can choose the organization<br>
of his or her preference. On the other hand, if the recruiter submits the requirement, instant short-listing of online<br>
candidates Is done or alerts sent to candidates to mobile devices prompting the candidate to login to HR ATM<br>
?	The test if applicable will start if short-listed.<br>
?	The audio-visual interview with recording, white boarding, document exchange, and online presentations can be<br>
initiated if test is cleared.<br>
?	Online verifications are done using the audio-visual Performance Records, if the candidate clears the interview.<br>
?	Compensation is fixed using the compensation management facility<br>
?	Approvals are taken using workflow automation if all the previous steps are completed successfully.<br>
?	The offer Is released online and can be viewed by the candidate if all the previous steps are completed successfully.<br>
?	The candidate can accept the offer online on viewing the offer.<br>
?	The candidate can take the offer letter printout from the location using the device after accepting the offer.<br>
?	The offered candidate Is given user name and password to access the offered candidates portal for further interaction<br>
between the candidate and the organization.<br>
Audio-visual Performance Records Is one of the key features used by this device, wherein every previous step from rewards to relieving order to Performance Records, to interviews, to references are in the form of audio-visual format that Is verifiable online<br>
With HR ATM, the Interviewer can see and hear the person who has given the relieving orders, references or performance commendations. Since verifications are online, the offer can be issued.The candidate can see the offer, accept and print the offer letter. Note that this device supports Instant hiring right from submission of resume to offer release Irrespective of the location of the candidate or recruiters.<br>
RECORDING PERFORMANCE RECORDS<br>
The recruitment process Is not complete until the history of the candidate is verified.This could be education history, career history, performance history, awards history or reference history.<br>
This device Is futuristic In nature since It utilizes audio-visual Performance Records. Performance Records of each candidate Is built by recording of every important events in audio-visual format There will be a unique id on the hard copy and the audiovisual Performance Records and an entry In the database as updated by the person who releases the documents pertaining to the candidate. With this unique feature the recruiter can see the event and also verify the hardcopy and compare with the data updated In the database.This provides a three-way verification support and becomes highly fool proof.<br>
The device Is designed to record the Performance Records of candidates. At the same time, the device provides the critical feature of instant verifications so as to complete the recruitment process.<br><br><br>
To record an event, the authorized person can use the HR ATM to enter critical Information and then record the event In an audiovisual format. Once this is done, a print out of the document can be taken from the HR ATM. One copy will be given to the candidate. For example, If an employee Is relieved from service of one organization, the HR manager who Issues the relieving order can enter key information like, date of joining, joining designation, last working day, designation on leaving etc and then record the audiovisual performance records. Once the data Is verified, the HR manager who will Issue the hard copy of the letter can take printouts. An unique id will be maintained in the database, performance records and hardcopy. When this candidate provides this hardcopy to another decision maker like a recruiter on a later date, the recruiter can use the HR ATM to enter the unique id provided on the hardcopy of the document and see the audiovisual performance records and even verify the critical data In the database.Thus the HR ATM's performance record provides three-way verification and also helps provide solutions to problems as identified in the current scenario like:<br>
1.	Forging of resumes and employment history Is a major problem today. With HR ATM'S key feature called performance<br>
records, the authorized person can administer a three-way verification.<br>
2.	Verification takes time since It may have to be done with Institutes, all pervious corporate etc. HR ATM provides instant<br>
verification through replay able performance records.<br>
3.	High cost of employment verification. HR ATM cost very less to maintain, saves on travel, travel time and Improves<br>
productivity.<br>
4.	Muiti location verifications becomes difficult. Example a candidate who has worked In two or more countries. HR ATM<br>
can record performance records and keep track of every key events irrespective of the location. So the end user can<br>
see it in one go.<br>
5.	Performance of candidates Is forgotten over time. With HR ATM, every commendation, award or recognition can be<br>
recorded to make sure that performers have a lasting Identity.<br>
6.	Verification of track record before interview is not possible today. With HR ATM, using the unique id, the recruiter or<br>
decision maker can view the authentic track record.<br>

SCOPE AND AMBIT OF THE INVENTION<br>
SCOPE: This device is invented to provide instant hiring solution. In other words, even when the candidate and recruiters are in different locations, this device can be used to complete the whole recruitment process.<br>
This does not mean that the device cannot be used when the candidate and recruiters are in one location. In this situation, the device can be used for Performance Records verification, recording or testing.<br>
The scope of this invention starts with providing facility for corporate to do resource planning followed by analyzing of manpower requirement, publishing of manpower requirement, followed by the candidate using the device for -Identification of open positions, submission of resumes, short listings, tests, interviews, reference checks, education verifications, employment verifications, performance verifications, compensation management, work flow, instant work flow approvals, online presentations, document sharing and exchange, release of offers, acceptance of offers and candidate printing the offer, and access to the offered employees portal, all happening in one sitting irrespective of the location or country the candidate or recruiter is based at<br>
Usefulness and Usage of HR ATM comprises of the situations as listed below:<br>
An invention must possess utility for the grant of patent. The HRATM has the following usefulness<br>
?	From unequal opportunity to equal opportunity for all job aspirants is a key usefulness. In a countries where most<br>
corporates are in downtown locations, the opportunity Is not equal for those who are In rural locations and those<br>
passing ut of rural colleges. HR ATM provides equal opportunity irrespective of location to any job aspirant to any open<br>
positions in corporates across any locations In the country or anywhere else.<br>
?	Submit your Resume: Immediately get tested on the key skills - Print your offer.<br>
?	Audio-visual Performance Records that recruiters can see the key achievements in both education, career or other<br>
achievements.<br>
?	Playback Performance authentication: A person with 15 years experience who has achieved an Important feat in the<br>
3rd year can still replay the recognition that is linked to his or her performance record.<br>
?	Playback built in Employment verification, especially in a world of forged resumes and high amount of money spent on<br>
employment verification, here is a solution with replay feature for employment verification, linked to the process.This<br>
means that the recruiter can see all the HR managers who have given relieving orders in the previous organization<br>
including the educational Institutes and corporate.<br>
?	Faster recruitment: No time lag i.e. Submission of resume to test to interview and offer in one sitting.<br>
?	Recruitment panel can be In multiple locations.The candidate can be interviewed by both panels.This helps immediate<br>
decision making.<br>
?	The Triple A Advantage: Anytime, Anywhere, Any job seeker - Does not matter which part of the world the candidate or<br>
the interviewer Is in.<br>
?	Unique identity for Performers: Rewards and recognitions that were given many years back may get forgotten if not<br>
recording id Performance Records.<br>
?	Cost Saving: Since the recruiter need to travel and can save time and productivity.<br>
?	Performance Records: Providing visibility for performers. Lasting Identity for performers and authentic track record to<br>
prove a clean track record using audio-visual Performance Records.This also includes a unique id. Using the unique id,<br>
the recruiters can verify and play Performance Records and track record online.<br><br><br>
?	Mobile ATM: Now the recruiter or the job seeker can avail the mobile ATM.This means that an institute in a remote<br>
location can provide exposure to their students or a recruiter can avail an ATM to Interview a candidate.<br>
?	Audio-visual interview can be recorded for future review or to help candidates improve their skills.<br>
?	Candidate or candidates in one location can complete the recruitment process with the recruiters in another location.<br>
Example: A candidate In location A being recruited by one ore more recruitment panel In another location B<br>
?	Candidate or candidates in one location can complete the recruitment process with more than one panel located in<br>
more than one location. Example: A candidate in location A being recruited by two or more panels of Interviewers, i.e.<br>
one panel In location B and the second panel in location C (There could be any number of panels)<br>
?	Recruiters or decision makers can review the Performance Records of candidates using the device.<br>
?	The candidates can record and upload their Performance Records using the device.This could include, education<br>
events, career events, rewards and recognition, commendations, disciplinary action, references, relieving orders, and<br>
other performance related records in the form to audio-visual Performance Records.<br>
?	A candidate can complete the recruitment process with more than one organization in multiple locations.<br>
?	The device is mobile and hence can be installed anywhere, based on need. For example, senior candidates can take up<br>
the interview from his or her residence.<br>
?	The network of devices can be deployed across corporates, Institutes, net cafes, consultants offices, and other<br>
recruitment service providers.<br>
?	If the recruiter submits the job specification of an open position, the device can short list registered candidates and list<br>
them.The recruiter can view these candidates profile and proceed with interview process immediately, in case the<br>
candidates are online. In case the short listed candidates are not online, an alert can be sent to the candidates<br>
prompting them to logon to the nearest HR ATM.<br>
?	Recruiter can interview candidates who are located in multiple locations<br>
?	Interviews can be recorded, if required. Decision makers can review interviews at any time, if a candidate is rejected once<br>
and appears again after a period of time, then the current panel can review the old interview. Candidates can use these<br>
to review their performance and to improve their skills.<br>
?	Commitments made on joining can be recorded using the device and stored based on action date and this can be<br>
reviewed by the administrators for prompt action at the right time.<br>
?	The job seeker can use the device for identifying employment opportunity.<br>
?	The recruiter can user the device to identify potential employees or to shortlist candidates<br>
?	The pre defined sequential recruitment process being defined by the user based on the policy pertaining to the users<br>
organization.This means that the steps as listed in the pre defined sequential recruitment process can be redefined to<br>
suit that users organization policy.<br>
?	The device also works as an instant verification machine with the three way fool proof verification process. These<br>
verifications comprises of performance, education, career, professional achievements or reference verifications.<br>
?	The device also works as an audio visual performance-recording device with three way security feature.These recording<br>
comprises of events like performance, education, career, professional achievements or reference verifications related events<br>
recording.<br><br><br>
?	The three way security feature makes sure that each event recorded using the device goes through a three way security<br>
process i.e one for the audiovisual performance record, one for the database, and one for the hard copy.There will be a<br>
unique performance verification id on the hard copy, audio-visual Performance Records and an entry in the database as<br>
updated by the person who releases the documents pertaining to the candidate. With this unique feature the recruiter<br>
can see the event and also verify the hardcopy and compare with the data updated in the database.This provides a<br>
three-way verification support and becomes highly fool proof.<br>
?	The device provides the SAVE and RESUME option. If situation demands, the user can save the pre defined sequential<br>
process to the stage it has been completed.The pre defined sequential process can be resumed from the stage the last<br>
save was effected so as to complete the whole process.<br>
?	The device provides the option of recording responses of candidates for a predefined set of questions.This means that<br>
response to certain questions can be pre recorded and added to the performance records. For example, questions like,<br>
what would you like to be in the next 5 years? Or what do you think are your strengths and weaknesses? These are<br>
common questions that can be part of the performance records.These questions can be in audiovisual or textual<br>
format, which are recorded and saved.<br>
?	White the recruiter is not available for interview, the candidate can still respond to the pre recorded questions.These<br>
questions can be in audiovisual or textual format.The response of the candidate Is recorded and made available for<br>
review by the recruiter.<br>
?	Performance profile provides date based chronological history of every key events right from education, career,<br>
performance, references, and other achievements in audiovisual performance records format with three way verification<br>
feature to maintain a fool proof authentic track record. Performance profile constitutes of textual content, audiovisual<br>
records and key information stored in the database the candidate can print a performance profile which is a<br>
combination of textual performance records and links to audiovisual performance records.The three way security<br>
feature makes sure t hat each event recorded using the device goes through a three way security process i.e one for the<br>
audiovisual performance record, one for the database, and one for the hard copy,There will be a unique performance<br>
verification Id on the hard copy, audio-visual Performance Records and an entry in the database as updated by the<br>
person who releases the documents pertaining to the candidate. With this unique feature the recruiter can see the<br>
event and also verify the hardcopy and compare with the data updated in the database.This provides a three-way<br>
verification support and becomes highly fool proof- Performance profile being the HR ATMs solution for the current<br>
resumes which can be forged.<br>
?	Performance records are recorded as and when the event happens. For example, a rank holder can record the<br>
achievement. For those events, which have already been completed, the authorized person can use the recording<br>
option to update the event. In this case, the event date will be a past date, but the date of updating or recording will be<br>
the current date. For examples candidate who was a rank holder goes back to the institute and requests the head of<br>
the school or the authorized person to update the record with regard to achieving the rank.The authorized person can<br>
record this after verification of actual records. Date of achievement can be updated as per actual achievement datethe<br>
date of updating or recording will be the current date.<br>
?	The device and method provides the employer the option to set the frequency of a candidate attending an interview if<br>
the previous interview resulted in the candidate being rejected. For example, if a rejected candidate can attend the next<br>
interview only after a gap of six months, then, when the candidate selects the organization for attending interview, the<br>
system validates the last rejected date and decides whether to allow to proceed or to indicate a date on which the<br>
candidate can attend interview with the organization in the future. In this case the mail id and performance records<br>
unique id will be referred to validate and hence the process becomes highly fool proof. For example, even if the<br>
candidate changes his mail id the performance records id cannot be changed. Moreover, the previous occurrences of<br>
interviews can also be recorded so that the decision maker can review the previous interview if required.<br><br><br>
?	Employability especially for those educated In rural locations is low.The reason being, these candidates don't get the<br>
type of exposure to improve their soft skills.This device can also be used to conduct mock sessions to help candidates<br>
exposure.This could be mock interviews, and other training sessions by professionals who are in downtown locations.<br>
?	In certain cases, the recruiter may like to keep a candidate on hold which means that the decision to give an offer or<br>
not is on hold for a temporary period.. In case the decision-making is on hold, then the candidate can come back and<br>
use the device to see the decision. In this case, the candidate needs to click on the interview status link and the list of<br>
organizations with which the candidate has attended interview will be listed. Once the candidate clicks on the link, the<br>
status will be displayed. If selected, the candidate can print the offer.<br>
?	The device keeps track of the number of offers a candidate has already received.This Is stored in the database under<br>
offer countThe recruiter can shortlist candidates if they are not currently offered by any other company.This gives<br>
opportunity for candidates who are not yet offered by any other company thereby providing more employment portunity,<br>
?	Performance records comprises of, among other information's, candidate information like income certificates, marks<br>
secured for various education levels, tests and community information.This information provides an option to shortlist<br>
candidates especially for community development. For example, those candidates who have scored above 90 percent<br>
with annual income lesser than a particular amount who belong to a community that needs development support.<br>
?	The device provides the remote testing wherein the candidate and recruiter can be in two different<br>
locations.The test administrator or the recruiter can see the candidate taking the test.The white boarding<br>
facility provides option to share objective and descriptive type answers immediately so as to enable<br>
the recruiter to verify the correctness of answers immediately and shortlist. Since the recruiter can see the candidate, the candidate cannot manipulate or take outside support to take the test at the same time the recruiter can shortlist candidates without asking them to travel to corporate or other locations for test thereby providing equal opportunity for candidates in remote locations.<br>
AMBIT OF THE INVENTION<br>
HR ATM is designed for instant hiring of human resources and hence under the ambit of business management and more specifically human resource management. One may call it recruitment, staff augmentation, hiring or procurement of human resources. Audio-visual Performance Records being an integral part of this device also comes under the ambit of human resources management.<br>
Novelty from the candidate's point of view: Any Time Manpower device either manned or unmanned, that can be installed In any location or country which can be used by any candidate to identify opportunity and to print his or her offer after successfully completing the recruitment process Is novel.This means that a candidate can walk in to use an HR ATM and walk out with his offer letter.<br>
Novelty from the recruiter's point of view: The HR ATM is designed to complete the whole recruitment process In one sitting. The recruitment process is not complete until education, career, performance and reference verifications are done.<br>
This device is futuristic in nature since it utilizes audio-visual Performance Records, Performance Records of each candidate is built by recording of every important events in audto-visual format. For example, a school leaving certificate, a college degree, a reward certificate, a relieving order,employment certificate etc.There will be a unique Id on the hard copy and the audio-visual Performance Records and an entry in the database as updated by the person who releases the documents pertaining to the candidate.With this unique three-way verification feature the recruiter can see the event and also verify the hardcopy and compare with the data updated in the database.This three-way verification support is highly fool proof.<br><br><br>
(Non-obviousness): A patent application involves an inventive step if the proposed invention is not obvious to a person skilled in the art i.e., skilled In the subject matter of the patent application.<br>
In the current scenario, can a candidate in some part of the world, who does not know about open positions In various organizations to suit that candidates profile, be able to be short listed using a device that can take that candidate through the complete process of hiring from listing of opportunities, to submission of profile, short listing,to testing, verifications, document exchange, compensation management, release of offer, acceptance of offer, to printing of offer by the candidate and also providing access to that corporates offered employee portal, all happening in one sitting while the recruiter is in another part of the world?<br>
In the current scenario, NO! 1$ the obvious answer, because:<br>
The problems that organizations face today:<br>
1.	Resumes that are forged.<br>
2.	No mechanism of Performance authentication history supported by the resume.<br>
3.	No mechanism of proving authentic track record support by the resume.<br>
4.	Resources near to the corporate locations get opportunity first whereby creating unequal opportunity for candidates<br>
in other distant locations especially rural locations where we need provide more job opportunities.<br>
5.	Demand to Supply imbalance due to fewer resources only have access to open positions.<br>
6.	More time taken to meet manpower resource required.<br>
7.	No visible identity for performers like rank holders.<br>
The prior art cannot point towards the invention, implying that the practitioner of the subject matter could not have thought about the invention prior to filing of the patent application in which case there would have been already solutions existing for the above mentioned problems In the current recruitment scenario.<br>
This proves that there is an inventive step between the proposed patent and the prior art at this point of time; hence a new invention has taken place.<br><br></td>
