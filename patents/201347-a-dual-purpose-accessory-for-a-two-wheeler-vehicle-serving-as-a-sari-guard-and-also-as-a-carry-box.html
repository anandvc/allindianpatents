				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a dual purpose accessory for a two wheeler vehicle serving as a sari guard and also as a carry-box.<br>
The sari guard for two wheeler vehicles is known to the art. This device is used to prevent the sari of a woman pillion rider from getting entangled in the rear wheel of the vehicle when in motion.<br>
An object of this invention is to utilise the space available adjacent the sari guard to provide a carry-box for carrying various articles, such as, a briefcase, a market-bag and so on, whenever there is no pillion rider on the vehicle. However, whenever a person desires to ride on the pillion, the carry-box can be rendered collapsible and put away by the side of the sari guard, flush with it, so that there is no inconvenience caused to the pillion rider.<br>
As a corollary of the foregoing object of this invention, another object is to make the best of an existing accessory to furnish another accessory with .minor additions to the former accessory.<br><br>
According to this invention, the dual purpose accessory for a two wheeler vehicle serving as a sari guard and also as a carry-box, comprises a first frame attachable to the side of the vehicle, at its rear, said first frame being provided with a footrest and a Bcreen serving as a sari guard; a second frame loaded by a spring and pivotably attached to the first frame, to enable the second frame to be folded, to lie flush against the first frame, and unfolded, transversely to the first frame, to an extent determined by a stopper, thus creating a carry-box structure defined by the first and second frames, for receiving within said structure, articles to be transported along with the vehicle, the said spring exerting a force on the second frame tending to bring it to its folded position, thereby also tending to keep any article in the said structure, which is hi contact with the second frame, securely in portion under such force.<br>
This invention will now be described in further detail with reference to the accompanying drawings which illustrate, by way of example, and not by way of limitation, one of possible embodiments of the dual purpose accessory proposed herein , wherein<br>
Figs. 1 and 2 illustrate side and front views of the embodiment with the second frame in its folded position<br><br>
Figs. 3 and 4 illustrate side and front views of the embodiment with the second frame in its unfolded position creating a cany-box structure<br>
Figs. 5 and 6 illustrate side tad front views of the embodiment with the carry-box structure containing a brief case, exemplifying an article to be carried with the vehicle.<br>
A first frame Fl is attachable to the side of the vehicle, at its rear, the frame Fl being provided with a footrest A and a screen S serving as a sari guard.<br>
A spring-loaded second frame F2 is ptvotabry attached to the frame Fl to render the frame F2 fold able, to lie flush with respect to the frame Fl; and also to reader the frame F2 unfoldable transversely with respect to the frame Fl.creating a carry-box structure D defined by the first and second frames. This structure is suitable for receiving therein articles, such as, briefcases, bags and so on. The footrest A of the sari guard S serves as the base support for the articles in the carry-box structure.<br>
The frame F2 is spring-loaded by the tofsion spring T which tends to bring the frame F2, from its unfolded<br><br>
t<br>
condition to its folded condition. This spring also tends to keep any article in the said structure, which is in contact with the second frame, for example a brief case, securely in position under such force.<br>
The frame F2 is peripherally located within the frame Fl. The said frames are spaced from each other by a cam spacer G on either side of the frames.<br>
The frame F2 is unfold able to a predetermined limit by a stopper, so that the said frame does not unfold beyond such limit defeating the very purpose of creating- a carry-box structure. In the embodiment illustrated the stopper is exemplified by a projection P on the cam spacer, G<br>
*<br>
against which the frame F2 butts, while being unfolded, to arrest any further movement of the said frame.<br>
The frame F2 is pivotably attached to the frame Fl by pins J at the sides of the frames, the pins being secured<br>
r<br>
by nuts N.<br>
The second frame F2, in its folded condition, is seated in an E-clamp K provided for the first frame Fl.<br>
It will be appreciated from the foregoing description that various other embodiments of the accessory proposed herein are possible without departing from the scope and ambit of mis invention<br><br><br><br><br>
We Claim:<br>
l.A dual purpose accessory for a two wheeler vehicle serving as a sari guard and also as a carry-box, comprising a first frame attachable to the side of the veh icle, at its rear, said first fram e being provided with a footrest and a screen serving as a sari guard; a second frame loaded by a spring and pivotably attached to the first frame, to enable the second frame to be folded, to lie flush against the first frame, and unfolded, transversely to the first frame, to an extent determined by a stopper, dius creating a carry-box structure defined by the first and second frames, for receiving within said structure, articles to be transported along with the vehicle, the said spring exerting a force on the second frame tending to bring it to its folded position, thereby also tendhtg to keep any article in the said structure, which is in contact with the second frame, securely in position under such force.<br>
2.	An accessory as claim ed in Claim 1 wherein the<br>
second frame and the first frame are peripherally located one within the other and spaced from each other by a cam spacer provided on either side of the frames.<br><br>
3.	An Accessory iS claimed in Claim 2 wherein the stopper consists of a projection on the cam spacer against which the second frame butts while unfoldinf to tin it farther movement of the said  frame<br>
4.	An accessory as claimed in any one of die preceding Claims wherein the second frame is pivotably attached to the fnrst frame by pins at the sides of the frames, the pins bemg secured by nnts.<br>
5.An accessory as claimed in any one of the preceding Claims wherein the second frame, in its 'ifolded condition, is seated in an E-clamp provided for the first frame.<br>
6.A dual purpose accessory for a two wheeler vehicle servmg as a sari guard and also as a carry- box, substantially as herem described with reference to and as illustrated in the accompanying  drawings.<br><br></td>
