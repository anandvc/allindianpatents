				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
5	The invention relates to a lifting device for<br>
lifting heavy loads, e.g. derailed rail vehicles, for permanent or temporary installation, having at least one cylinder, in particular hydraulic cylinder, for actuating a mechanical ram.  In concrete terms,  the<br>
10 present invention relates to a so-called "internal jack".<br>
Vehicles (e.g. trams, underground trains, etc.) which, in the event of derailment, are impossible to lift and/or move from outside the derailed vehicle<br>
15 (e.g. when in tunnels) are recovered using so-called "internal jacks". Internal jacks are understood to mean lifting devices which are fitted permanently or temporarily in the floor area in the interior of the vehicle and by means of which recovery measures can be<br>
2	0  carried out from outside even where accessibility is<br>
extremely restricted. Known internal jacks are designed as single-acting hydraulic cylinders or telescopic cylinders which are generally attached in the floor of the vehicle. Therefore, a floor sleeve provided for<br>
25 this purpose is arranged on the vehicle. The cylinder is installed head-first in this floor sleeve. In operation, the piston rod, when actuated, . extends downwards and lifts the vehicle body so that it can then be moved.<br>
30	In low-floor vehicles, which are now being used<br>
to an increasing extent, suitable installation of the internal jacks is becoming more and more difficult due to the restricted space available.<br>
The object of the present invention consists in<br>
3	5  providing a lifting device which can be used for low-<br>
floor vehicles and, at the same time, has a high level of safety against buckling and flexural load-bearing capacity combined with perfect running.<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
This object is achieved, in the lifting device of the generic type, by the fact that cylinder and ram are separated from one another and the ram is accommodated in a guide tube. The invention makes it 5 possible to achieve a lifting device which provides sufficient force and very stable guidance in the area of the ram and which can be accommodated in particular in the outer wall area of low-floor vehicles.<br>
Advantageously, the ram is designed as a hollow<br>
10 ram. This firstly reduces its weight and secondly simplifies fitting of the ram. On the other hand, the strength of the ram is maintained.<br>
The tool insert, which may in particular be designed as an exchangeable tool insert, is situated at<br>
15  the front end of the hollow ram.<br>
To attach the lifting device to the vehicle, the guide tube comprises a catch, in particular a bayonet catch. The catch is advantageously situated in the floor area of the vehicle.<br>
20	According to a further configuration of the<br>
present invention, cylinder and ram are connected to one another in an articulated manner. This prevents elastic distortions in use from being transmitted from the ram area to the cylinder area, where they would<br>
25  lead to damage to the running faces or seals.<br>
Such an articulated connection can be produced in a particularly simple manner by using a ball socket and ball cap in the area of the contact face between ram and piston rod of the cylinder.<br>
30	Advantageously, the articulated movement of ram<br>
with respect to piston rod is spring-loaded, specifically, by way of example, by means of at least one spring element which is provided between cylinder and ram and may be designed as a spring element which<br>
35  acts in the axial direction.<br>
According to a further configuration of the present invention, the ram and the piston rod of the cylinder can be connected to one another by means of a<br><br>
inside of the hollow ram.<br>
Furthermore, according to a refinement of the invention^ a holding ring, e.g. in the form of a clasp 5 nut, is provided in the area of the connection between piston rod and ram. The holding ring holds together the area where the piston rod of the cylinder and the guide tube meet. To avoid adverse effects from dirt, a seal is provided between holding ring and cylinder. The seal<br>
10 has the further advantage that the ram cannot itself be rotated with respect to the cylinder in the load-free state as a result of slight shaking, and therefore the connection between holding tube and vehicle cannot be released unintentionally.<br>
15	The holding ring is designed or dimensioned in<br>
such a way that it allows a pivoting movement of the ram, including guide tube, with respect to the cylinder.<br>
The outer sides of the cylinder and of the<br>
20 holding ring are expediently aligned, so that the diameter of the cylinder is not exceeded, thus ensuring problem-free installation.<br>
Furthermore, it is possible, in particular in the case of a lifting device which remains permanently<br>
25 on the vehicle, to provide a securing device for fixing the position of cylinder and/or ram.<br>
The securing device used is, for example, at least one securing pin in the area of the cylinder and/or ram and/or holding ring. The securing pin may in<br>
3 0 this case advantageously be arranged so as to run in the radial direction.<br>
The lifting device according to the invention is very particularly suitable for installation in the outer wall area of the vehicle,  in particular,  for<br>
35 example, in the section column of the outer wall. The locking position of the lifting device is preferably provided in the floor area of the vehicle.<br><br>
An  expedient  configuration  or  cne  present, invention is explained in more detail with reference to the drawings, in which: Fig. 1  shows  a  sectional  illustration  through  the<br>
lifting  device  according  to  the  present<br>
invention; Fig. 2a shows a sectional illustration on line E-F in<br>
Fig. 1; Fig. 2b shows a sectional illustration on line C-D, and Fig. 2c shows a sectional illustration on line A-B in<br>
Fig. 1.<br>
In Fig. 1, reference numeral 1 denotes the lifting device, e.g. a so-called "internal jack", in its entirety. The lifting device 1 comprises a cylinder 2 with a piston rod 9 which is guided in the cylinder 2 by means of a piston 21. The piston rod 9 runs in a guide part 19 at the widened end of the cylinder 2. On the opposite side, there is a closure cover 20 and a connection, which is provided in the closure cover 20, with a hydraulic hose 17 and quick-fitting coupling 14. A corresponding quick-fitting coupling 16 is also provided in the widened area of the cylinder 2, for connection to a hydraulic hose 18.<br>
The hydraulic hoses 17, 18 are connected to a reversing valve and a pump with reservoir, which are not shown in Fig. 1.<br>
According to the present invention, cylinder 2 and ram 3 are formed separately from one another. To this end, a ram, in the form of a hollow ram, is provided and is guided in a guide tube 4. A holding ring, in particular in the form of a clasp nut 12, is situated on the outer side of the guide part 19 and adjoining guide tube 4.<br>
Piston rod 9 and ram 3 are connected to one another by means of a threaded bolt which is arranged centrally, with a spring element 10, which acts in the axial direction, interposed between them. In addition, at its end side the piston rod 9 is designed as a ball cap 8 and the adjoining end side of the ram 3 is<br><br>
designed as a ball socket 7, with the result that ram 3 can be pivoted to a certain extent with respect to piston rod 2. The holding ring is in this case to be designed in such a way that it allows a certain degree of pivoting of ram 3, guide tube 4 and cylinder 2.<br>
In its end area facing towards the ram 3, the cylinder 2 has a widened diameter which, in this area, corresponds to the diameter of the holding ring or of the clasp nut 12. The ram 3 is guided in a guide tube 4. A catch, in particular bayonet catch 5, is situated on the guide tube 4 for the purpose of locking the guide tube 4 in the floor area of a vehicle (not shown).<br>
An encircling seal 13, in the form of an 0-ring seal, is situated between the widened area of the cylinder 2 and the holding ring, which seal ensures that it is impossible for any dirt to pass between cylinder and holding ring. Furthermore, the seal 13 has the additional function of ensuring that the ram 3, including guide tube 4, cannot itself rotate with respect to the cylinder 2 in the load-free state as a result of slight shaking, and as a result the bayonet locking on the bayonet catch 5 cannot be released when this is not desired.<br>
According to the invention, the piston rod 9 and the ram 3 are connected to one another in an articulated manner, specifically, by way of example, by means of a ball cap 8 which is provided in the area of the contact face between piston rod 9 and ram 3 and interacts with a ball socket 7. Piston rod 9 and ram 3 are connected to one another by means of a threaded bolt 11 which can be screwed in axially. In addition, the threaded bolt 11 acts on an axial spring element 10. In order to ensure articulated mobility of the ram 3 with respect to the piston rod 9, the hole for the threaded bolt 11 is oversized in the area of the ram 3.<br>
Furthermore, the clasp nut 12 is likewise dimensioned in such a way that it allows the ram 3 to pivot with respect to the piston rod 9. An individually<br><br>
side of the ram 3. The securing pin 15 prevents any rotation between clasp nut 12 and guide tube 4.<br>
Fig. 2a shows the arrangement of two securing 5 pins 22 in the area of the widened part of the cylinder 2 (cf. in this respect Fig. 2a) . Furthermore, two securing pins 23 are also provided in the area of the ram 3 (cf. Fig. 2b) , with the result that the two components,  which  according  to  the  invention  are<br>
10 separate from one another, are secured in position even in the event of vibration, preventing them from becoming detached of their own accord.<br>
Fig. 2c shows the design of the bayonet catch 5 for fixing the position of the ram 3 on the vehicle.<br>
15	The lifting device 1 according to the invention<br>
is expediently fitted head-first in the outer wall area 1, in particular in the area of the section column of the outer wall, and the guide tube 4 of the ram 3 is coupled, at the bayonet catch 5, to the bayonet socket<br>
2 0  of the vehicle.<br>
The invention makes it possible to use lifting devices, in particular so-called "internal jacks", on rail vehicles where there is only a very limited amount of space at the bottom  (low-floor vehicles)  without<br>
2 5 having to accept any reduction in the stability of the lifting device.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
