				<td>ELECTRONICALLY CONTROLLED SAMPLE WARPER, ROTAKY e-R-EEL,AÂ£SEMBLY, AND WARPING METHOD<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a novel electronically controlled sample warper, wherein a rotary creel supporting detachably a plurality of bobbins around which different kinds and/or the same kind of yarns are wound and a bobbin station supporting detachably a plurality of bobbins in a standby state are used, and various kinds of yarns are exchanged according to the preset pattern data (yarn order), so that more kinds of yarns than the conventional ones can be wound on a warper drum, a rotary creel assembly used in the electronically controlled sample warper, and a novel warping method using the rotary creel assembly. 2. Description of the Related Art<br>
As an electronically controlled sample warper which has been used conventionally, there is known a structure as disclosed, for example, in Japanese Patent No. 1529104, where using a fixed creel supporting a plurality of bobbins around which different kinds (different colors or different twists) and/or the same kind of yarns are wound, the yarns are wound on a warper drum with a yarn introduction means while the yarn exchanging is performed by yarn selection guides according to the preset pattern data (yarn order).<br>
Also,   there  has   been  known   an   electronically  controlled<br>
1A<br><br>
sample warper which can warp a plurality of yarns concurrently, wherein time loss required for the yarn exchanging is cancelled and a plurality of yarns can concurrently be wound on a warper drum by using a rotary creel as well as omitting the yarn exchanging step, and further a period of time required for the warping work can be reduced (see Japanese Patent No. 1767706, USP No. 4, 972,662, and EP No. 0375480).<br>
Since the fixed creel has a plurality of bobbins around which different kinds and/or the same kind of yarns (mainly different kinds of yarns) are wound and it is used for warping the yarns one by one, it is advantageously possible to perform pattern warping, but the yarns are wound on a warper drum one by one, so it takes disadvantageously much time to perform warping work correspondingly. Meanwhile, the rotary creel has a plurality of bobbins around which the same kind and/or different kinds of yarns are wound, and it is used for the plain warping (for example, only red color yarns), and the limited pattern warping, such as one to one warping (for example, repetition of a yarn of red color and a yarn of white color, or repetition of a yarn of S twist and a yarn of Z twist), two to two warping (for example, repetition of two yarns of red color and two yarns of white color, or repetition of two yarns of S twist and two yarns of Z twist). With the rotary creel, it is disadvantageously impossible to perform pattern warping other than the limited pattern warping, but it is advantageously possible to wind a plurality of yarns concurrently on the warper drum so that<br>
-9  -<br><br>
the warping time is reduced largely.<br>

The present invention will hereinafter be described in connection with embodiments with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
In Fig.  1, an electronically controlled sample warper W of the present invention comprises-  a warper drum A;  a plurality of yarn    introduction    means    6a    to    6d    (four    in    the    illustrated embodiment) each mounted to a side surface of the warper drum for winding yarns 22a to 22e on the warper drum A; and a plurality of yarn selection guides 27 arranged in one end portion of a base for supporting   the   warper   drum   A   in   correspondence   to   the   yarn introduction means 6a to 6d, each the yarn selection guide 27 being pivotally moved to protrude to a yarn exchanging position when the yarns 22a to 22e are exchanged and pivotally moved to retract to a standby position  when  the  yarns  22a  to  22e  are  stored,  wherein yarns 22a to 22e are passed between the yarn introduction means 6a to 6d and the yarn selection guides 27, so that the yarns 22a to 22e are exchanged according to the preset yarn order to be wound on the warper    drum    A.    The    basic    structure    and    operation    of    the<br>
6<br><br>
electronically controlled sample warper W are well-known from the above-mentioned patent publications, and detailed description thereof will be omitted.<br>
In the electronically controlled sample warper W of the present invention, there are positioned adjacent corresponding ones of the plurality of yarn selection guides 27 a rotary creel F supporting a plurality of bobbins 100a to lOOe (five in the illustrated embodiment) around which different kinds and/or the same kind of yarns 22a to 22e are wound, and a bobbin station 102 supporting a plurality of bobbins 100a to 10Oe around which different kinds and/or the same kind of yarns are wound in a standby state.<br>
The characteristic structure of the present invention resides in that the bobbins 100a to l00e can detachably be supported by the rotary creel F and the bobbin station 102, respectively, and the bobbins 100a to lOOe can be passed freely between the rotary creel F and the bobbin station 102.<br>
In Fig. 1, reference numerals 104a to l04e denote bobbin bodies, which are composed of bobbin frames 106a to 106e and the bobbins 100a to lOOe attachable thereto, thereby the attaching and detaching operation of the bobbins 100a to lOOe being easy. The basic structure of the rotary creel F is not changed from a conventional one. However, the rotary creel F is provided at its front portion with a plurality of bobbin receiving recesses 108 (four in the illustrated embodiment), into which the bobbin bodies 104a to 104e are detachably inserted.<br>
- 7 -<br><br>
It is enough for the above bobbin station 102 to retain the plurality of bobbin bodies 104a to 104e detachably in a standby state, and there are no need any specific constructions therefor.     In the embodiment shown in Fig. 1, however, a plurality of bobbin receiving portions 112 (four in the illustrated embodiment) are formed on two rail members 110, 110 opposing to each other, and the bobbin bodies 104a to 104e are detachably set in the bobbin receiving portions 112. The bobbin station 102 (or the rail members 110,110 in the illustrated embodiment) may be movable so that the bobbin bodies 104a to l04e are easily passed between the rotary creel F and the bobbin receiving recesses 108.     Also, it is preferable that the bobbin bodies 104a to 104e are automatically passed by a known robot hand or the like according to the preset pattern data (yarn order).<br>
As the above-mentioned yarn selection guides 27, such conventional ones as shown in Fig. 2 can be used. In Fig. 2, the plurality of yarn selection guides 27 selectively guide yarns 22a to 22e according to the instructions from a program setting unit. The yarn selection guides 27 are attached one to each rotary solenoid 29. When the individual rotary solenoid 29 is energized, the corresponding yarn selection guide 27 is pivotally moved to advance to its operative position (yarn exchanging position) as shown with a phantom line in Fig. 3; when the rotary solenoid 29 is de-energized, the yarn selection guide 2 7 is reversely pivotally moved to its standby position (yarn storing position) as shown with a solid line in Fig. 3.<br>
- 8 -<br><br>
The movements of the yarn 22 during the yarn exchanging are shown in Figs. 3 and 4. The distal end of the yarn introduction means 6 is inwardly bent to provide a yarn introduction part 6' which is disposed against the front end of the outer periphery of the warper drum. The yarn 22k caught by the selection guide 27 initially located in its standby position (yarn storing position) assumes its yarn position 221 as the selection guide 27 is pivotally moved to advance to its operative position(yarn exchanging position) as shown with a phantom line. From this position, the yarn 221 is caught by the yarn introduction part 6' and wound around the warper drum A. The yarn selection guide 2 7 from which the yarn is removed is returned to the standby position (yarn storing position). 22m designates the posture in which the yarn 22 is moved one turn, and when the yarn is not exchanged the yarn is wound around the warper drum A passing through an upper side of a guide plate S as in this posture.<br>
When the yarn 22m being caught by the yarn introduction part 6' and wound on the warper drum A is removed therefrom by a yarn removing unit 32, the yarn 22m is pulled back to the direction of the rotary creel by a pulling-back device (not shown) and guided to a lower side of the guide plate S by a guide bar 59a, then assuming its posture 22n. The yarn selection guide 27 is pivotally moved to advance to its operative position to catch the removed yarn, and returns to the standby position (yarn storing position) with holding  the  yarn.   The  yarn  in  the  standby  position  assumes  its<br>
- 9 -<br><br>
posture 22p in Fig. 4.<br>
In Figs. 2 to 4,  16 designates a drum spoke of the warper<br>
drum A;  17, a conveyor belt provided on the drum spoke 16; 59, a<br>
yarn introduction cover arranged on one side of the warper drum A;<br>
59a, a guide bar attached on the inner surface of a lower portion of<br>
the yarn introduction cover 59; and E, a yarn fastener mounted to a<br>
base Y.<br>
The     operation     of    the     above-described     electronically<br>
controlled sample warper W will now be described.<br>
Firstly, as shown in Fig. 1, the bobbin bodies 104a, 104b are inserted into the bobbin receiving recesses 108, 108 of the rotary creel F, and yarns 22a, 22b are wound around the warper drum A by the yarn introduction means 6a, 6b. On the other hand, the bobbin bodies 104c, 104d are set in the bobbin receiving portions 112, 112 of the bobbin station 102 in a standby state, and yarns 22c, 22d are out of operation.<br>
Next, when winding of four yarns 22a to 22d is performed, the bobbin bodies 104c, 104d are inserted into the remaining bobbin receiving portions 108, 108 of the rotary creel F, and the yarn selection guides 27 are operated so that the yarns 22c, 22d are moved to advance to the yarn exchanging positions from the yarn storing positions to be held by the yarn introduction means 6c and 6d,thereby the yarns being wound around the warper drum A.<br>
When winding of the yarns 22a, 22b is out of operation, the bobbin  bodies   104a,   104b  are  detached from  the bobbin  receiving<br>
10 -<br><br>
recesses 108, 108, then the, yarns 22a, 22b are removed from the yarn introduction means 6a, 6b and caught by the yarn selection guide 27 to be stored, and the bobbin bodies 104a, 104b are set to the bobbin receiving portions 112, 112 of the bobbin station 102.<br>
Furthermore, when winding of a new yarn 22e is performed, the bobbin body 104e is mounted to an empty bobbin receiving recess 108 of the rotary creel F, and on the other hand the yarn selection guide 27 is actuated to get the yarn introduction means 6a to catch the yarn 22e so that the yarn 22e can be wound around the warper drum.<br>
Thus, it is easy to use larger number of the bobbins 100a to lOOe (five in the illustrated embodiment) than the number of the yarn introduction means 6a to 6d (four in the illustrated embodiment) so that a wide variety of pattern warping may be unlimitedly performed. Also, the reduction of the warping time may be realized by concurrently winding a plurality of yarns on the warper drum A.<br>
In the above-mentioned embodiment, there is described the case wherein four yarn introduction means 6a to 6d, four bobbin receiving recesses 108 of the rotary creel F, four bobbin receiving portions 112 of the bobbin station 102, and five bobbins 100a to lOOe are used. It is possible, however, to employ eight to sixteen or more of yarn introduction means 6, eight to sixteen or more of bobbin receiving recesses 108 of the rotary creel F, eight to twenty or more of the bobbin receiving portions 112 of the bobbin station  102, and<br>
11<br><br>
eight to forty or more of the bobbins so as to perform ultimately a wide variety of pattern warping with various kinds of yarns.<br>
In   the   above   embodiment,   there   is   explained   the   case<br>
wherein   the   yarn   exchanging   is   performed   by   exchanging   the<br>
bobbins of the rotary creel F for the ones of the bobbin station 102.<br>
In the case where there is no need to use. the bobbins of the bobbin<br>
station  102, it is possible, as a matter of course, to warp only the<br>
yarns wound around the bobbins supported by the rotary creel F. In<br>
this  case,  the yarns wound around the bobbins supported by the<br>
rotary  creel  are  guided to  the  yarn  introduction  means  6a  to  6d<br>
through the yarn selection guides 27. Thus, such a manner as the<br>
yarn selection guide 27 are applied to the rotary creel F is a novel<br>
inventive    idea    which    does    not    reside    in    any    conventional<br>
electronically controlled sample warpers. The structure where the<br>
yarns are guided to the yarn introduction means 6a to 6d through<br>
the yarn selection guides 27 may advantageously and largely save<br>
time and labor in exchanging the bobbins and so on in comparison<br>
with the conventional one where the yarns of bobbins are directly<br>
guided to the yarn introduction means 6a to 6d. In this embodiment,<br>
using one yarn introduction means with the rotary creel F being in<br>
an inoperative state, there is no doubt that pattern warping may be<br>
performed as in the aforementioned known fixed creel.<br>
As described above, according to the electronically controlled sample warper of the present invention, though using the rotary  creel,  it is  possible  to  employ various  kinds  of yarns  and<br>
12 -<br><br>
perform the yarn exchanging thereof unlimitedly, thus enabling various pattern warping to be freely performed with the reduced warping time.<br>
According to the rotary creel assembly of the present invention, it is possible to warp yarns on the warper drum with a plurality of bobbins supported by the rotary creel, set the remaining bobbins which are not used for warping yarns in the bobbin station in a standby state and perform the bobbin exchanging between the rotary creel F and the bobbin station 102. Therefore, the rotary creel assembly is used very preferably when performing pattern warping with a number of yarns.<br>
Also, according to the warping method of the present invention, using the above-mentioned rotary creel assembly of the present invention, it is possible to perform pattern warping with various kinds of yarns and warp concurrently a plurality of yarns with the reduced warping time.<br>
Obviously, various minor changes and modifications of the present invention are possible in the light of the above teaching. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of appended claims the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described.<br>
