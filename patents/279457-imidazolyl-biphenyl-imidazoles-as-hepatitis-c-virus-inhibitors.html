				<td>IMIDAZOLYL BIPHENYL IMIDAZOLES AS HEPATITIS C VIRUS INHIBITORS<br>
The present disclosure is generally directed to antiviral compounds, and more specifically directed to compounds which can inhibit the function of the NS5A protein encoded by Hepatitis C virus (HCV), compositions comprising such compounds, and methods for inhibiting the function of the NS5A protein.<br>
HCV is a major human pathogen, infecting an estimated 170 million persons worldwide - roughly five times the number infected by human immunodeficiency virus type 1. A substantial fraction of these HCV infected individuals develop serious progressive liver disease, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.<br>
Presently, the most effective HCV therapy employs a combination of alpha-interferon and ribavirin, leading to sustained efficacy in 40% of patients. Recent clinical results demonstrate that pcgylated alpha-interferon is superior to unmodified alpha-interferon as monotherapy. However, even with experimental therapeutic regimens involving combinations of pegylated alpha-interferon and ribavirin, a substantial fraction of patients do not have a sustained reduction in viral load. Thus, there is a clear and long-felt need to develop effective therapeutics for treatment of HCV infection.<br>
HCV is a positive-stranded RNA virus. Based on a comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence and the extensive similarity in the 5' untranslated region, HCV has been classified as a separate genus in the Flaviviridae family. All members of the Flaviviridae family have enveloped virions that contain a positive stranded RNA genome encoding all known virus-specific proteins via translation of a single, uninterrupted, open reading frame.<br>
Considerable heterogeneity is found within the nucleotide and encoded amino acid sequence throughout the HCV genome. At least six major genotypes have been characterized, and more than 50 subtypes have been described. The major genotypes of HCV differ in their distribution worldwide, and the clinical significance of the genetic heterogeneity of HCV remains elusive despite numerous studies of the possible effect of genotypes on pathogenesis and therapy.<br>
The single strand HCV RNA genome is approximately 9500 nucleotides in length and has a single open reading frame (ORF) encoding a single large polyprotein of about 3000 amino acids. In infected cells, this polyprotein is cleaved at multiple<br>
sites by cellular and viral proteases to produce the structural and non-structural (NS) proteins. In the case of HCV, the generation of mature non-structural proteins (NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B) is effected by two viral proteases. The first one is believed to be a metalloprotease and cleaves at the NS2-NS3 junction; the second one is a serine protease contained within the N-terminal region of NS3 (also referred to herein as NS3 protease) and mediates all the subsequent cleavages downstream of NS3, both in cis, at the NS3-NS4A cleavage site, and in trans, for the remaining NS4A-NS4B, NS4B-NS5A, NS5A-NS5B sites. The NS4A protein appears to serve multiple functions, acting as a cofactor for the NS3 protease and possibly assisting in the membrane localization of NS3 and other viral replicase components. The complex formation of the NS3 protein with NS4A seems necessary to the processing events, enhancing the proteolytic efficiency at all of the sites. The NS3 protein also exhibits nucleoside triphosphatase and RNA helicase activities. NS5B (also referred to herein as HCV polymerase) is a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that is involved in the replication of HCV.<br>
Compounds useful for treating HCV-infected patients are desired which selectively inhibit HCV viral replication. In particular, compounds which are effective to inhibit the function of the NS5A protein are desired. The HCV NS5A protein is described, for example, in Tan, S.-L., Katzel, M.G.  Virology 2001, 284, 1-12; and in Park, K.-J.; Choi, S.-H, J. Biological Chemistry 2003.<br>

Accordingly, the disclosure further provides pharmaceutical compositions, which include therapeutically effective amounts of compounds of formula (I) or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents, or excipients. The term "therapeutically effective amount," as used herein, refers to the total amount of each active component that is sufficient to show a meaningful patient benefit, e.g., a reduction in viral load. When applied to an individual active ingredient, administered alone, the term refers to that ingredient alone. When applied to a combination, the term refers to combined amounts of the active ingredients that result in the therapeutic effect, whether administered in combination, serially, or simultaneously. The compounds of formula (I) and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, are as described above. The carrier(s), diluent(s), or excipient(s) must be acceptable in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof. In accordance with another aspect of the present disclosure there is also provided a process for the preparation of a pharmaceutical formulation including admixing a compound of formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents, or excipients. The term "pharmaceutically acceptable," as used herein, refers to those compounds, materials, compositions, and/or dosage forms which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of patients without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problem or complication commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio, and are effective for their intended use.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations may be presented in unit dose forms containing a predetermined amount of active ingredient per unit dose. Dosage levels of between about 0.01 and about 250 milligram per kilogram ("mg/kg") body weight per day, preferably between about 0.05 and about 100 mg/kg body weight per day of the compounds of the present disclosure are typical in a monotherapy for the prevention and treatment of HCV mediated disease. Typically, the pharmaceutical compositions of this disclosure will be administered from about 1 to about 5 times per day or alternatively, as a continuous infusion. Such administration can be used as a chronic or acute therapy. The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the<br>
carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending on the condition being treated, the severity of the condition, the time of administration, the route of administration, the rate of excretion of the compound employed, the duration of treatment, and the age, gender, weight, and condition of the patient. Preferred unit dosage formulations are those containing a daily dose or sub-dose, as herein above recited, or an appropriate fraction thereof, of an active ingredient. Treatment may be initiated with small dosages substantially less than the optimum dose of the compound. Thereafter, the dosage is increased by small increments until the optimum effect under the circumstances is reached. In general, the compound is most desirably administered at a concentration level that will generally afford antivirally effective results without causing any harmful or deleterious side effects.<br>
When the compositions of this disclosure comprise a combination of a compound of the present disclosure and one or more additional therapeutic or prophylactic agent, both the compound and the additional agent are usually present at dosage levels of between about 10 to 150%, and more preferably between about 10 and 80% of the dosage normally administered in a monotherapy regimen.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations may be adapted for administration by any appropriate route, for example by the oral (including buccal or sublingual), rectal, nasal, topical (including buccal, sublingual, or transdermal), vaginal, or parenteral (including subcutaneous, intracutaneous, intramuscular, intra-articular, intrasynovial, intrasternal, intrathecal, intralesional, intravenous, or intradermal injections or infusions) route. Such formulations may be prepared by any method known in the art of pharmacy, for example by bringing into association the active ingredient with the carrier(s) or excipient(s). Oral administration or administration by injection are preferred.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for oral administration may be presented as discrete units such as capsules or tablets; powders or granules; solutions or suspensions in aqueous or non-aqueous liquids; edible foams or whips; or oil-in-water liquid emulsions or water-in-oil emulsions.<br>
For instance, for oral administration in the form of a tablet or capsule, the active drug component can be combined with an oral, non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable inert carrier such as cthanol, glycerol, water, and the like. Powders are prepared by comminuting the compound to a suitable fine size and mixing with a<br>
similarly comminuted pharmaceutical carrier such as an edible carbohydrate, as, for example, starch or mannitol. Flavoring, preservative, dispersing, and coloring agent can also be present.<br>
Capsules are made by preparing a powder mixture, as described above, and filling formed gelatin sheaths. Glidants and lubricants such as colloidal silica, talc, magnesium stearate, calcium stearate, or solid polyethylene glycol can be added to the powder mixture before the filling operation. A disintegrating or solubilizing agent such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate, or sodium carbonate can also be added to improve the availability of the medicament when the capsule is ingested.<br>
Moreover, when desired or necessary, suitable binders, lubricants, disintegrating agents, and coloring agents can also be incorporated into the mixture. Suitable binders include starch, gelatin, natural sugars such as glucose or beta-lactose, corn sweeteners, natural and synthetic gums such as acacia, tragacanth or sodium alginate, carboxymethylcellulose, polyethylene glycol, and the like. Lubricants used in these dosage forms include sodium oleate, sodium chloride, and the like. Disintegrators include, without limitation, starch, methyl cellulose, agar, betonite, xanthan gum, and the like. Tablets are formulated, for example, by preparing a powder mixture, granulating or slugging, adding a lubricant and disintegrant, and pressing into tablets. A powder mixture is prepared by mixing the compound, suitable comminuted, with a diluent or base as described above, and optionally, with a binder such as carboxymethylcellulose, an aliginate, gelating, or polyvinyl pyrrolidone, a solution retardant such as paraffin, a resorption accelerator such as a quaternary salt and/or and absorption agent such as betonite, kaolin, or dicalcium phosphate. The powder mixture can be granulated by wetting with a binder such as syrup, starch paste, acadia mucilage, or solutions of cellulosic or polymeric materials and forcing through a screen. As an alternative to granulating, the powder mixture can be run through the tablet machine and the result is imperfectly formed slugs broken into granules. The granules can be lubricated to prevent sticking to the tablet forming dies by means of the addition of stearic acid, a stearate salt, talc, or mineral oil. The lubricated mixture is then compressed into tablets. The compounds of the present disclosure can also be combined with a free flowing inert carrier and compressed into tablets directly without going through the granulating or slugging steps. A clear or opaque protective coating consisting of a<br>
sealing coat of shellac, a coating of sugar or polymeric material, and a polish coating of wax can be provided. Dyestuffs can be added to these coatings to distinguish different unit dosages.<br>
Oral fluids such as solution, syrups, and elixirs can be prepared in dosage unit form so that a given quantity contains a predetermined amount of the compound. Syrups can be prepared by dissolving the compound in a suitably flavored aqueous solution, while elixirs are prepared through the use of a non-toxic vehicle. Solubilizers and emulsifiers such as ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols and polyoxyethylene sorbitol ethers, preservatives, flavor additive such as peppermint oil or natural sweeteners, or saccharin or other artificial sweeteners, and the like can also be added.<br>

The compounds of formula (I) and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof may also be delivered by the use of monoclonal antibodies as individual carriers to which the compound molecules arc coupled. The compounds may also be coupled with soluble polymers as targetable drug carriers. Such polymers can include polyvinylpyrrolidone, pyran copolymer, polyhydroxypropylmethacrylamidephenol, polyhydroxyethylaspartamidephenol, or polyethyleneoxidepolylysine substituted with palitoyl residues. Furthermore, the compounds may be coupled to a class of biodegradable polymers useful in achieving controlled release of a drug, for example, poly lactic acid, polepsilon capro lactone, poly hydroxy butyric acid, polyorthoesters, polyacetals, polydihydropyrans, polycyanoacrylates, and cross-linked or amphipathic block copolymers of hydrogels.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for transdermal administration may be presented as discrete patches intended to remain in intimate contact with the<br>
epidermis of the recipient for a prolonged period of time. For example, the active ingredient may be delivered from the patch by iontophoresis as generally described in Pharmaceutical Research 1986, 3(6), 318.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations adapted for topical administration may be formulated as ointments, creams, suspensions, lotions, powders, solutions, pastes, gels, sprays, aerosols, or oils.<br>

Scheme 1: Symmetric or Asymmetric Biphenyls Aryl halide 1 and boronic ester 2 can be coupled to produce biaryl 3 using standard Suzuki-Miayura coupling conditions (Angew Chem. Int. Ed. Engl 2001, 40, 4544). It should be noted that the boronic acid analog of 2 may be used in place of the ester. Mono-deprotection of the pyrrolidine moiety may be accomplished when R12 and R13 are different. When R12 = benzyl, and R13 = t-butyl treatment to hydrogenolytic conditions produces 4. For example, Pd/C catalyst in the presence of a base such as potassium carbonate can be used. Acylation of 4 can be accomplished under standard acylation conditions. A coupling reagent such as HATU in combination with an amine base such as Hunig's base can be used in this regard. Alternatively, 4 may be reacted with an isocyanate or carbamoyl chloride to provide compounds of formula 5 where R9 is an amine. Further deprotection of 5 can be accomplished by treatment with strong acid such as HC1 or trifluoroacetic acid. Standard conditions analogous to those used to convert 4 to 5 can be used to prepare 7 from 6. In another embodiment where R12 = R13 = t-Bu, direct conversion to 8 can be accomplished by treatment of J with strong acid such as HC1 or trifluoroacetic acid. Conversion of 8 to 7 is accomplished in analogous fashion to the methods used to prepare 5 from 4 or 7 from 6. In this instance however, the caps in 7 will be identical.<br>

Scheme 4: Symmetric Biphenyls Symmetrical biphenyl analogs (compounds of formula 7 where both halves of the molecule are equivalent) can be synthesized starting from bromoketone 20. Amination by displacement with a nucleophile such as azide, phthalimide or preferably sodium diformylamide (Yinglin and Hongwen, Synthesis 1990, 122) followed by deprotection affords 21. Condensation under standard amination conditions such as HATU and Hunig's base with an appropriately protected amino acid provides 22. Heating with ammonium acetate under thermal or microwave conditions results in the formation of 3 which can be deprotected with strong acid such as HC1 or trifluoroacetic acid (R12 = R13 = t-Bu) or by hydrogenolysis with hydrogen gas and a transition metal catalyst such as Pd/C (R12 = R13 = benzyl). Acylation can be affected with a carboxylic acid (R'CChH) in a manner similar to the conversion of 21 to 22. Urea formation can be accomplished by treatment with an appropriate isocycante (R9 = R24R25N; R25 =H) or carbamoyl chloride (R9 = R24R25N; R25 is other than hydrogen).<br>

Keto-amide 24 can be prepared from 23 via condensation with an appropriate cyclic or acyclic amino acid under standard amide formation conditions. Bromide 26 can give rise to 23 by treatment with a nucleophile such as azide, phthalimide or sodium diformylamide (Synthesis 1990, 122) followed by deprotection. Bromide 26 can also be converted to 27 by reacting with an appropriate cyclic or acyclic N-protected amino acid in the presence of base such as potassium carbonate or sodium bicarbonate. Bromination of 28 with a source of bromonium ion such as bromine, NBS, or CBr4 results in the formation of 26.

derivative 34. Compound 34 can be elaborated to 35 by treatment to hydrogenolytic<br>
conditions with hydrogen and a transition metal catalyst such as palladium on carbon<br>
 (R13 = benzyl). Acylation of 35 can be accomplished with an appropriate acid chloride (R9COCl) in the presence of a base such as triethylamine, with an appropriately substituted carboxylic acid (R9CC&gt;2H) in the presence of a standard coupling reagent such as HATU, or with an isoscyanate (R27NCO wherein R9 = R27R28N-; R28 =H)or carbamoyl chloride (R27R28NC0C1 wherein R9 = R27R28N-). Compound 37 can be prepared from 36 (R12 = t-Bu) via treatment with strong acid such as HC1 or trifluoroacetic acid. Acylation of the resulting amine in 37 to give 38 can be accomplished as in the transformation of 35 to 36. In cases where R12 = R13, 34 can be directly transformed into 39 by treatment with strong acid such as HC1 or trifluoroacetic acid (R12 = R13 = t-Bu) or by employing hydrogenolytic conditions with hydrogen and a transition metal catalyst such as palladium on carbon (Rl2 = R13 = benzyl).

Scheme 9: Symmetric Cap Substituted Heteroaryls Compound 43 (analogous to 42 wherein R23 = -CH(NHBoc)R24) may be elaborated to 45, 46, and 47 via similar methodologies to those described in Scheme 3. In cases where R2o = alkoxymethyl (ie; SEM), removal can be accomplished simultaneously with removal of the Boc carbamate (cf; 43 to 44) using strong acid such as HC1 or trifluoroacetic acid.<br>

Scheme 10: Starting Material 29 Heteroaryl bromides 54 may be reacted with a vinyl stannane such as tributyl(l-ethoxyvinyl)tin in the presence of a source of palladium such as dichlorobis(triphenylphosphine)palladium (II) to provide 55 which can be subsequently transformed into bromoketone 57 via treatment with a source of bromonium ion such as N-bormosuccinimide, CBr4, or bromine. Alternatively, keto-substiruted heteroaryl bromides 53 may be directly converted to 51 via treatment with a source of bromonium ion such as bromine, CBr4, or N-bromosuccinimide. Bromide 51 can be converted to aminoketone 48 via addition of sodium azide, potassium phthalimide or sodium diformylamide (Synthesis 1990 122) followed by deprotection. Aminoketone 48 can then be coupled with an appropriately substituted amino acid under standard amide formation conditions (i.e.; a coupling reagent such as HATU in the presence of a mild base such as Hunig's base) to provide 49. Compound 49 can then be further transformed into imidazole 50 via reacting with ammonium acetate under thermal or microwave conditions. Alternatively, 51 can be directly reacted with an appropriately substituted amino acid in the presence of a base such as sodium bicarbonate or potassium carbonate providing 52 which can in turn be reacted with ammonium acetate under thermal or microwave conditions to provide 50.

Scheme 11: Substituted Phenylglycine Derivatives Substituted phenylglycine derivatives can be prepared by a number of methods shown below. Phenylglycine t-butyl ester can be reductively alkylated (pathyway A) with an appropriate aldehyde and a reductant such as sodium cyanoborohydride in acidic medium. Hydrolysis of the t-butyl ester can be accomplished with strong acid such as HC1 or trifluoroacetic acid. Alternatively, phenylglycine can be alkylated with an alkyl halide such as ethyl iodide and a base such as sodium bicarbonate or potassium carbonate (pathway B). Pathway C illustrates reductive alkylation of phenylglycine as in pathway A followed by a second reductive alkylation with an alternate aldehyde such as formaldehyde in the presence of a reducing agent and acid. Pathway D illustrates the synthesis of substituted phenylglycines via the corresponding mandelic acid analogs. Conversion of the secondary alcohol to a competent leaving group can be accomplished with p-toluensulfonyl chloride. Displacement of the tosylate group with an appropriate amine followed by reductive removal of the benzyl ester can provide substituted phenylglycine derivatives. In pathway E a racemic substituted phenylglycine derivative is resolved by esterification with an enantiomerically pure chiral auxiliary such as but not limited to (+)-l-phenylethanol, (-)-l-phenylethanoI, an Evan's oxazolidinone, or enantiomerically pure pantolactone. Separation of the diastereomers is accomplished via chromatography (silica gel, HPLC, crystallization,<br>
etc) followed by removal of the chiral auxiliary providing enantiomerically pure phenylglycine derivatives. Pathway H illustrates a synthetic sequence which intersects with pathway E wherein the aforementioned chiral auxiliary is installed prior to amine addition. Alternatively, an ester of an arylacetic acid can be brominated with a source of bromonium ion such as bromine, N-bromosuccinimide, or CBr4. The resultant benzylic bromide can be displaced with a variety of mono- or disubstiruted amines in the presence of a tertiary amine base such as triethylamine or Hunig's base. Hydrolysis of the methyl ester via treatment with lithium hydroxide at low temperature or 6N HC1 at elevated temperature provides the substituted phenylglycine derivatives. Another method is shown in pathway G. Glycine analogs can be derivatized with a variety of aryl halides in the presence of a source of palladium (0) such as palladium bis(tributylphosphine) and base such as potassium phosphate. The resultant ester can then be hydrolyzed by treatment with base or acid. It should be understood that other well known methods to prepare phenylglycine derivatives exist in the art and can be amended to provide the desired compounds in this description. It should also be understood that the final phenylglycine derivatives can be purified to enantiomeric purity greater than 98%ee via preparative HPLC.<br>

Pathway B illustrates the acylation of the starting phenylglycine derivative with an appropriate chloroformate while pathway C shows reaction with an appropriate isocyanate or carbamoyl chloride. Each of the three intermediates shown in pathways A - C may be deprotected by methods known by those skilled in the art (ie; treatment of the t-butyl ester with strong base such as HC1 or trifluoroacetic acid).<br>

BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY An HCV Replion assay was utilized in the present disclosure, and was prepared, conducted and validated as described in commonly owned PCT/US2006/022197andinO'Boyleet. al. Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2005 Apr;49(4): 1346-53.<br>
HCV lb-377-neo replicon cells were used to test the currently described compound series as well as cells resistant to compound A due to a Y2065H mutation in NS5A (described in application PCT/US2006/022197). The compounds tested were determined to have more than 10-fold less inhibitory activity on cells resistant to compound A than wild-type cells indicating a related mechanism of action between the two compound series. Thus, the compounds of the present disclosure can be effective to inhibit the function of the HCV NS5A protein and are understood to be as effective in combinations as previously described in application PCMJS2006/022197 and commonly owned WO/O4014852. Further, the compounds of the present disclosure can be effective against the HCV lb genotype. It should also be understood that the compounds of the present disclosure can inhibit multiple genotypes of HCV. Table 2 shows the EC50 values of representative compounds of the present disclosure against the HCV lb genotype. In one embodiment compounds of the present disclosure are active against the la, lb, 2a, 2b, 3a, 4a, and 5a genotypes. EC50 ranges against HCV lb are as follows: A = 1-10 HM; B = 100-999 nM; C = 1-99 nM; and D = 1-999 pM.<br>
The compounds of the present disclosure may inhibit HCV by mechanisms in addition to or other than NS5A inhibition. In one embodiment the compounds of the<br>
present disclosure inhibit HCV replicon and in another embodiment the compounds of the present disclosure inhibit NS5A.<br>
