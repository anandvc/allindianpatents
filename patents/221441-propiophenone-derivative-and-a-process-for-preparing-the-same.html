having a hypoglycemic activity, and a process for preparing the same. Prior Art<br>
Although diet therapy is essential in the treatment of diabetes, when diet therapy does not sufficiently control the conditions of patients, insulin or an oral antidiabetic is additionally used. There have been used as antidiabetic biguanide compounds and sulfonylurea compounds, however, these antidiabetics have various side effects, for example, biguanide compounds cause lactic acidosis, and sulfonylurea compounds cause significant hypoglycemia.  Under such circumstances, it has been desired to develop novel drugs for treatment of diabetes having no such side effects.<br>
Recently, it has been reported that hyperglycemia participates in the outbreak and progressive impairment, i.e. glucose toxicity theory. That is, chronic hyperglycemia leads to decrease insulin secretion and contributes to increase insulin resistance, and as a result, the blood glucose concentration Is increased so that diabetes is self-exacerbated [cf. Diabetologia, Vol. 28, p. 119 (1985); Diabetes Care, Vol. 13, p. 610 (1990), etc.]. Thus, by treating hyperglycemia, the aforementioned self-exacerbating cycle is interrupted so that the prophylaxis or treatment of diabetes is made possible.<br>
As one of the methods for treating hyperglycemia, it is considered to excrete an excess amount of glucose directly into urine so that the blood glucose concentration is normalized.<br>
Phlorizin is a glycoside which exists in barks and stems of Rosaceae (e.g. apple, pear, etc.).  Recently, it has been found that phlorizin is an inhibitor of Na+-glucos6 co-transporter which exists only at chorionic membrane of the intestine and the kidney, by which phlorizin inhibits the renal tubular glucose reabsorpfion and promotes the excretion of glucose so that the<br><br>
blood glucose is controlled. Based on this action of phlorizin, when the blood glucose concentration in diabetic animals Is controlled at a normal level for a long time by subcutaneous daily administration of phlorizin but without using insulin, the conditions of diabetic animals are ameliorated to be normal [cf. Journal of Clinical Investigation, Vol. 79, p. 1510 (1987), Vol. 80, p. 1037 (1987), Vol. 87. p. 561 (1991). etc.].<br>
However, when phlorizin Is administered orally, most of it is hydrolyzed into glucose and phloretin, which is the agJycon of phlorizin, and hence, the amount of phlorizin to be absorbed is so little that the urine glucose excretion effect of phlorizin is very weak. Besides, phlorefn, which is the aglycon of phlorizin, has been known to inhibit strongly a facilitated diffusion-type glucose transporter. So. when phloretin is intravenously administered to rats, the glucose concentration in brain of rats is decreased [cf. Stroke, Vol. 14, p. 388 (1983)]. Thus, when phlorizin is administered for a long time, there may be bad effects on various tissues, and hence, phlorizin has not been used as an antidiabetic.<br>
Brief Description of invention<br>

Experiment: Urine glucose increasing activity in rats . Method:<br>
A test compound solution (dosage; 100 mg/kg) was orally administered twice at 8-hr intervals to male SD-rats {3 to 5 rats/group, 6 wk old). A test compound solution was prepared by adding Tween 80 (Nacalai Tesque, Ltd., Japan, final concentration: 0.5 % aqueous solution) to a test compound {the compound of the following Examples or phlorizin) at a rate of 100 mg/5 ml.  In the control group, a 0.5 % aqueous Tween 80 solution {5 ml/kg) was administered instead of the test compound solution.  Rats were housed individually into a metabolite cage, and urine was collected for 24 hours after the first administration of the test compound. After measuring the urine volume, the urine was centrifuged In order to remove the impurity, and the<br><br>
urine glucose concentration therein was determined by glucose-analyzer (Apec Co., Ltd.). The amount of the urine glucose (mg) excreted for 24 hours was detennined based on the urine volume (ml), the urine glucose concentration therein (mg/dl), and the weights of rats, and expressed as mg/24 hr/200 g of body weight. The results are shown in Table 1.<br><br><br>
As is clear from the above results, the proplophenon© derivative [I] of the present invention show about 11 to 100 times as strong urine glucose increasing activity as phlorizin does.<br>

[Effects of the Invention]<br>
The desired propiophenone derivatives [1] of the present invention and pharrnaceutically acceptable salts thereof have excellent hypoglycemic activity based on the inhibitory activity of renal glucose reabsorption thereof, by which they are useful in the treatment or prophylaxis of diabetes. For example, when administered orally to rats, the present compounds increase the amount of urine glucose 11 to 100 times as much as phlorizin does.<br>
in addition, the desired propiophenone derivatives (1] of the present invention and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof have low toxicity. For example, when 2'-(P-D-glucopyranosyloxy)-6'-hydroxy-3-(5-benzo-<br>
[b]furanyl)propiophenone or 2'-{2,3-di-0-acetyl-p-D-giucopyranosyloxy)-6'-hydroxy-3-(5-benzo[b]furany!}propiophenone was orally administered once to rats at a dose of 3000 mg/kg, no rat died. Besides, the aglycone of the desired propiophenone compound [I], a hydrolysate thereof, shows extremely weak inhibitory activity of facilitated diffusion-type glucose transporter,<br>
Thus, the desired compound [1] of the present invention can treat hyperglycemia, by which the self-exacerbating cycle of glucose-toxicity is interrupted, so that the propiophenone derivatives [1] and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof are useful in the prophylaxis or treatment of diabetes such as insulin-dependent diabetes {l-type diabetes), insulin-independent diabetes (ll-type diabetes).<br><br><br>
