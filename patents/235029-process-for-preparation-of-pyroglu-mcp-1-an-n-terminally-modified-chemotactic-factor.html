Method for the production of an N-terminally modified<br>
chemotactic factor<br>
5The invention relates to a process for preparing pyroGlu-MCP-1 from<br>
recombinantly produced Gln-MCP-1 and compositions containing pyroGlu-<br>
MCP-1 preparations.<br>
MCP-1 (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1; also known by the names:<br>
l0monocyte chemotactic and activating factor 'MCAF', macrophage chemotactic<br>
factor 'MCF' tumour necrosis factor stimulated gene-8 'TSG-8', 'HC-11',<br>
smooth muscle cell chemotactic factor 'SMC-CF', lymphocyte derived<br>
chemotactic factor 'LDCF' as well as glioma derived chemotactic factor<br>
'GDCF') is a member of the CC-chemokine family. Human MCP-1 protein was<br>
15originally described in US Patent No. 5,714,578. It is synthesised under<br>
natural conditions in the body (natively) as a precursor protein 99 amino acids<br>
long, which is then processed to form a peptide with 76 amino acid groups.<br>
Mature human MCP-1 (hMCP-1) is a glycoprotein with a molecular weight of<br>
14 kDa and is secreted by many types of cells, e.g. smooth vascular muscle<br>
20cells and endothelial cells (Leonard and Yoshimura (1990), Immunology<br>
Today 11, 97 -101). It contains two intramolecular disulphide bridges and is<br>
Oglycosylated and sialylated when expressed natively (J. Yan Ling et al.<br>
(1990), Journal of Biological Chemistry, 265, 18318 -18321).<br>
25The protein is a product of the JE gene of the chromosomal location 17q11.2-<br>
q21.1. This gene locus is also known as SCY A2 (small inducible cytokine<br>
A2). The human gene was first described in US Patent No. 5,212,073. The<br>
expression of this gene may be induced by a number of cytokines, such as<br>
e.g. tumour necrosis factor alpha, but also by immunoglobulin G, for example.<br>
30The gene sequence and further information on the gene and the gene<br>
product are available in the NCBI Data bank under Accession Number<br>
M37719 (see Table 1).<br><br><br>

25lt has already been explained in the above-mentioned US 5,714,578 that in<br>
the case of an MCP-1 protein isolated from a native source the N terminus is<br>
blocked. Only later was it discovered that this is due to a post-translational<br>
modification in which the glutamine exposed after the cleaving of the leader<br>
sequence at the N terminus of the mature protein is cyclised, losing an NH3<br>
30molecule, to form a pyroglutamate group.<br>
The identification of the open reading frame coding for MCP-1 in US<br>
5,212,073 allowed recombinant expression of the protein. An MCP-1<br>
produced by the recombinant method, e.g. in E. coli, does not have the<br>
35typical N- or O-glycosylation pattern of the native MCP-1. An MCP-1<br>
preparation prepared in this way also does not oppose Edman decomposition<br>
in the same way as a preparation obtained from native material, i.e. it<br>
contains unblocked N termini (glutamines). In cellular assays based on the<br><br>
10Case 1-1492-FF	5 Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH et al.<br>
chemotactic effect on macrophages, originally no difference could be found<br>
between the biological activity of native MCP-1 preparations and those<br>
obtained by the recombinant method.<br>
5Under physiological conditions MCP-1 acts as an agonist to the beta-<br>
chemokine receptors CCR2 and CCR4, both of which are expressed mainly<br>
on monocytes and are also found both on basophiles and on T- and B-<br>
lymphocytes. MCP-1 induces monocyte chemotaxis even at subnanomolar<br>
concentrations. The receptors CCR2 and CCR4 are G-protein-coupled seven-<br>
lOtransmembrane domain receptors which lead to the activation of monocytes<br>
and increased adhesion of integrins. This process ultimately results in the<br>
docking of monocytes to endothelial cells and the subsequent departure of<br>
the monocytes from the vascular system.<br>
15WO 98/44953 discloses the influence of MCP-1 on arteriogenesis, i.e. the<br>
growth of collateral arteries and/or other arteries from existing arteriolar<br>
connections. On the basis of this finding it was proposed in the above-<br>
mentioned International Patent Application to use MCP-1 for therapeutic<br>
purposes, namely for the treatment of vascular occlusive diseases which<br>
20may be alleviated by stimulating the formation of new blood vessels. Such<br>
vascular occlusive diseases are particularly coronary artery disease (CAD),<br>
peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD), cerebral and mesenterial<br>
arterial occlusive diseases, etc. The application also proposed the use of<br>
MCP-1-neutralising agents such as e.g. anti-MCP-1-antibody for preventing<br>
25new vascular formation in order to combat tumour growth, in particular, which<br>
is reliant on a sufficient blood supply and hence adequate vascularisation of<br>
the tumour tissue.<br>
In order to be able to use the MCP-1 protein as explained above in a<br>
therapeutic approach for promoting the vascularisation of tissue, large<br>
30enough quantities of this protein have to be made available with sufficient<br>
purity for pharmaceutical purposes. Human MCP-1 was originally obtained in<br>
native form from cultures of the human glioma cell line U105MG or from<br>
human mononuciear leukocytes of peripheral blood. Protein intended for<br>
therapeutic purposes cannot be isolated from these sources because the<br><br>
Case 1 -1492-FF	6 Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH et al.<br>
production of large enough amounts would only be possible at unacceptably<br>
high cost in terms of labour and/or materials: it would not be possible to<br>
obtain human leukocytes in the required quantity. The glioma cells could<br>
indeed be replicated in virtually unrestricted amounts, but are unsuitable for<br>
5cultivation in biotechnological fermenters and additionally require foetal calf<br>
serum for their cultivation, for example, with all the attendant problems.<br>
Instead of the native expression of MCP-1 it is therefore an inviting prospect<br>
to prepare MCP-1 by the recombinant method. In fact recombinant human<br>
10MCP-1 is already commercially available, particularly from Messrs R&amp;D<br>
Systems (Catalogue no. 279-MC) and Peprotech (Catalogue no. 300-04; see<br>
Table 2; the catalogue numbers quoted are those applicable in January<br>
2003). According to the product specification of the commercially available<br>
recombinant MCP-1 preparations the MCP-1 protein present therein contains<br>
15the amino acid glutamine (Q) at the N terminus. The product description also<br>
indicates that this protein preparation is highly sensitive, particularly in the<br>
reconstituted liquid form (recommended max storage : 1 week at 4°C). In fact,<br>
experiments by the inventor (internal prior art) showed that when the<br>
conventional MCP-1 protein preparations are stored in dissolved form the -<br>
20biologically active - protein preparation appears to show signs of<br>
contamination by breakdown products very rapidly, particularly at<br>
temperatures above 4 °C (appearance of secondary bands in analytical HPLC<br>
chromatographs).<br>
Table 2 (extract from the Internet Website of Messrs Peprotech<br>
25	http://www.peprotech.com/content/details.htm?results=1&amp;prod=<br>
Recombinant Human MCAF (Human MCP-1)<br><br><br><br>
Case 1-1492-FF	7 Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH et al.<br>
15<br>
30A conventional method of recombinantly producing human MCP-1 protein is<br>
by the temperature-induced expression of the protein as a fusion protein,<br>
purification of the inclusion bodies formed subsequently, dissolving and<br>
refolding of the protein and subsequent enzymatic release of the hMCP-1<br>
protein from the fusion protein.<br>
35<br>
In conventional processes for the recombinant preparation of human MCP-1<br>
protein the problem arises that a protein which is N-terminally shortened by<br>
one or more amino acids is often obtained as a by-product. These by-<br>
products may behave as antagonists to MCP-1 receptors in biological<br>
40systems.<br>
In Van Coiliie et al. (1998), Biochemistry 37: 12672, 12673 a.E. a process is<br>
described in connection with experiments on the influence of N-terminal<br>
modifications on the biological activity of MCP-2, wherein an MCP-2<br>
45preparation obtained by the recombinant method is incubated in 0.01 M<br>
Na2HPO4, pH 8.0, for 24 hours at 37 °C. MCP-2 has 62% homology with<br>
MCP-1 at the level of the amino acid sequence and also differs from it to the<br>
extent that N-terminally unmodified MCP-1 is biologically active, unlike MCP-2<br>
(cf. the line "Biological Activity" in Table 2). The authors did not determine the<br>
50extent of the conversion of the N-terminal glutamine groups into a<br><br>
Case 1-1492-FF	8 Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH et al.<br>
pyroglutamate group which takes place under the conditions mentioned<br>
above. The inventors have found (internal prior art) that the application of<br>
comparable conditions to MCP-1 in any case leads to only partial cyclisation<br>
of the N-terminal amino acid (cf. Table 3, Comparison test 2).<br>
5<br>
One aim of the invention therefore, in the light of the foregoing discussion, is<br>
to provide a process by which an MCP-1-preparation (MCP-1 composition)<br>
may be prepared, which (a) is suitable for therapeutic purposes in view of its<br>
biological activity and (b) has advantages in terms of the drug licensing<br>
lOprocedures, which in the case of biopharmaceuticals contain requirements<br>
which are extremely difficult to comply with, e.g. with regard to the purity and<br>
reproducibility of production of the pharmaceutical composition, and in<br>
particular (c) has an excellent shelf life. Another related aim is to provide<br>
compositions or preparations which contain MCP-1 produced by the<br>
15recombinant method and are suitable for the purposes mentioned above or<br>
have the aforementioned advantages.<br>
These aims are achieved by the processes and compositions containing<br>
MCP-1 recited in the claims.<br>
20<br>
Thus according to the invention a process for preparing pyroGlu-MCP-1 from<br>
recombinantly produced Gln-MCP-1 is provided wherein Gln-MCP-1 is<br>
incubated at a temperature in the range from 30°C and 80°C, preferably in<br>
the range from 30°C and 70°C and more preferably in the range from 35 °C<br>
25to 60°C, in a buffer solution which has a salt concentration in the range from<br>
10 mM to 160 mM, preferably in the range from 10 mM to 100 mM, and which<br>
has a pH in the range from 2 to 7.5, preferably 3.5 to 7.5, more preferably 3.5<br>
to 6.5, more preferably 5 to 6.5, more preferably 5.5 to 6.5 and more<br>
preferably has a pH of about 6. The incubation is carried out until at least<br>
3090%, preferably at least 95 % and more preferably at least 96 % of the MCP-<br>
1 contained in the incubating buffer solution is present in the form of the<br>
pyroGlu-MCP-1.<br><br>
Case I-I492-FF	9 Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH et al.<br>
By "MCP-1" is meant, within the scope of this disclosure, the MCP-1 protein<br>
(without preprosequence), with an N-terminai glutamine group ("Gln-MCP-1";<br>
cf. the amino acid sequence shown in Table 1 and Table 2) or with an N<br>
terminus which has already been converted/cyclised into the pyroglutamate<br>
5group ("pyroGlu-MCP-1"), depending on the context. It is clear, however,<br>
that modifications of the MCP-1-protein which do not affect its biological<br>
function (esp. the monocyte-attractant activity or the effect on the CCR<br>
receptor) and do not alter its structure so that the reaction parameters<br>
described above no longer produce the desired result (i.e. the protein can no<br>
l0longer be converted into a pyroGlu-Variant by the process according to the<br>
invention), do not depart from the scope of protection. Thus, the process<br>
according to the invention is naturally also applicable to an MCP-1 in which a<br>
conservative amino acid exchange, e.g. serine to threonine or leucine to<br>
isoleucine, has taken place, provided that this affects neither the biological<br>
15function or activity of the resulting protein nor the convertibility of the N-<br>
terminal glutamine into pyroglutamate according to the above process. The<br>
process according to the invention can thus also be applied to MCP-1<br>
proteins of other mammals such as e.g. rats, mice, guinea pigs, rabbits and<br>
ferrets (and several others).<br>
20<br>
The buffer solution in which the process described above is carried out is<br>
preferably a phosphate-buffered (sodium and/or potassium phosphate-<br>
buffered) aqueous solution of low or physiological molarity, namely in the<br>
range from 10 to 160 mM, 10 to 80 mM, 10 to 50 mM, 20 to 40 mM or around<br>
2520 or 40 mM. If longer incubation times are accepted, according to one<br>
particular embodiment of the invention the work may also be done at<br>
physiological molarities, such as e.g. a saline concentration of around 150<br>
mM, this molarity preferably being achieved by the use of a phosphate-<br>
buffered saline solution or "PBS". The disadvantage of the longer incubation<br>
30period - and the attendant risk of increasing amounts of breakdown,<br>
secondary or oxidation products - is made up for in this particular<br>
embodiment by the advantage of being able to obtain the protein preparation<br>
straight away in the form of a solution with a physiological salt concentration.<br><br>
20Case 1-1492-FF	10 Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH et al.<br>
The buffer solution in which the modification step is carried out may also<br>
contain, for example, a (mild) detergent, an antioxidant, a preservative, a<br>
complexing agent, stabilisers, antimicrobial reagents, etc.<br>
5The incubation temperature is selected in the range from 30 °C to 80 °C, i.e.<br>
above ambient temperature. At lower temperatures the conversion step<br>
proceeds very slowly. In order to achieve virtually total conversion the<br>
incubation period would have to be increased substantially to more than a<br>
week. This would lead to stand times which are unacceptable in the<br>
l0 biotechnological process and would also substantially increase the risk of<br>
other forms of contamination of the protein solution (with breakdown or<br>
oxidation products, bacteria, viruses or other pathogens). On the other hand,<br>
although increasing the incubation temperature to above 80 °C does indeed<br>
greatly speed up the reaction of conversion, it also results in an increased<br>
15formation of undesirable by-products and breakdown products (cf. Examples<br>
1 and 2). If stand times of up to 6 days are acceptable, an incubation<br>
temperature of 35 to 40 °C is particularly preferred. In cases where incubation<br>
should be significantly shorter if possible, the incubation may also be carried<br>
out in the range from e.g. 50 to 60, 70 or 80 °C. Temperatures between 40<br>
20and 50 °C will naturally also produce the desired results.<br>
The pH of the incubating buffer solution should be in the range from 2 and<br>
7.5, i.e. in the neutral to acidic range. It is preferably in the range from 3.5 to<br>
7.5, more preferably in the range from 3.5 to 6.5, more preferably in the range<br>
25from 5 to 6.5, more preferably in the range from 5.5 to 6.5 and more<br>
preferably a pH of about 6 is selected.<br>
With a suitable choice of the above parameters, e.g. as described in the<br>
Examples, the pyroGlu-MCP-1 variant may be obtained with a purity of 90%<br>
30in any case and possibly higher, e.g. 95%, 96% or 98%, this percentage<br>
indicating the amount of pyroGlu-MCP-1 (determined e.g. as the area under<br>
the curve in an HPLC elution profile) based on the amount of total MCP-1<br>
present in the solution (i.e. including any remaining amount of Gln-MCP-1 and<br>
possible oxidation products and other by-products or breakdown products).<br><br>
Case I-1492-FF	11 Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH et al.<br>
According to another embodiment of the invention a process for preparing a<br>
pyroGlu-MCP-1 preparation is provided which comprises at least the following<br>
steps:<br>
5- preparing a Gln-MCP-1 preparation by the recombinant method by<br>
expression of a gene construct coding for MCP-1 in a host cell,<br>
-	optionally concentrating and/or purifying the Gln-MCP-1 contained in the<br>
Gln-MCP-1 preparation, and finally<br>
-	converting the Gln-MCP-1 which is contained in the Gln-MCP-1 preparation<br>
l0 or which was contained therein before the concentrating and/or purifying, into<br>
a pyroGlu-MCP-1 preparation which contains the protein molecule species<br>
pyroGlu-MCP-1, this step being carried out according to the "Process for<br>
preparing pyroGlu-MCP-1 from recombinantly produced Gln-MCP-1" as<br>
described above.<br>
15This process may optionally also include, for example, buffering the pyroGlu-<br>
MCP-1 preparation or further purification, e.g. by a subsequent step of<br>
column chromatography, dialysis, ultrafiltration, etc.<br>
Methods of producing recombinant proteins by biotechnology are known.<br>
20They comprise, in particular, fermentation, purification, concentration, and<br>
other steps. The step of conversion described above may be included at<br>
various points in a "multi-step process", i.e. with an as yet largely unpurified or<br>
wholly purified MCP-1 protein solution as the starting solution. It is also<br>
conceivable, in particular, to have a process in which not yet (totally)<br>
25converted Gln-MCP-1 in more, less or practically wholly purified form is<br>
lyophilised in order to improve its shelf life in as yet unconverted form and is<br>
in due course put back into solution and then converted into pyroGlu-MCP-1<br>
according to the above process. Naturally, the protein solution obtained after<br>
conversion into pyroGlu-MCP-1 may also be lyophilised.<br>
30<br>
The product of the process, namely the pyroGlu-MCP-1 preparation subjected<br>
to N-terminal modification (conversion), contains according to the invention an<br>
amount of pyroGlu-MCP-1 of at least 90 %, preferably at least 95 % and more<br><br>
Case I-1492-FF	12 Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH et al.<br>
25<br>
preferably at least 96 %, based on the total content of MCP-1 (converted plus<br>
unconverted protein plus by-products formed by oxidation, for example).<br>
The term (Gin- or pyroGlu-MCP-1-) preparation means that in the various<br>
5stages of the process the MCP-1 protein is present in dissolved form in a<br>
(buffer) solution and hence other components may be present in addition to<br>
the MCP-1, i.e. in any case the ions of the buffer salt used and possibly also<br>
other salts, antioxidants, stabilisers, antimicrobial reagents, detergents,<br>
preservatives, complexing agents, etc.<br>
10<br>
According to a further aspect of the invention a composition is provided which<br>
contains pyroGlu-MCP-1 or a pyroGlu-MCP-1 preparation obtained by the<br>
processes described above, in which at least 90 % of the MCP-1 contained in<br>
the composition (converted plus unconverted protein plus by-products; i.e. the<br>
15"area under the curve" in an HPLC elution chromatograph, for example) are<br>
present in the form of the pyroGIu-MCP-1.<br>
Thus, the invention also relates to an MCPO-1 preparation produced by the<br>
recombinant method particularly in prokaryotes and particularly preferably in<br>
20E. coli, wherein at least 90 % of the MCP-1 protein is present as pyroGlu-<br>
MCP-1. When prepared in common expression cells the protein will frequently<br>
not exhibit the natural glycosyfation pattern - unlike in native production.<br>
When prepared in prokaryotes such as e.g. E coli, in particular, the pyroGlu-<br>
MCP-1 obtained or the pyroGlu-MCP-1 preparation obtained unlike the form<br>
25which occurs in native expression in the human body will not be glycosylated<br>
and/or sialylated and will thus differ from a native protein of this kind or from a<br>
protein preparation obtained from a native source.<br>
A composition of this kind according to the invention may be, in particular, a<br>
30medicament or a pharmaceutical composition which contains, in addition to<br>
an amount of pyroGlu-MCP-1 which makes up at least 90 %, 95% or 96% of<br>
the total MCP-1 content (converted plus unconverted protein plus by-<br>
products), conventional excipients and carriers, salts, antioxidants, stabilisers,<br>
antimicrobial reagents, detergents, preservatives, complexing agents, etc.<br><br>
Case 1-1492-FF	13 Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH et al.<br>
The composition according to the invention may be used to treat patients<br>
suffering from an arterial occlusive disease such as in particular PAOD or<br>
CAD. The treatment comprises administering such a composition in a<br>
therapeutically effective amount by a suitable route, e.g. by intraarterial<br>
5infusion or in the form of a periarterially deposited gel, from which the MCP-1<br>
protein is released over a fairly long period.<br>
Surprisingly it has also been found that, contrary to expectations, the<br>
incubation of a recombinantly prepared MCP-1 protein preparation in<br>
lOaqueous solution and at elevated temperature does not lead to its<br>
decomposition and biological inactivation; on the contrary, with a suitable<br>
choice of a number of parameters, this step, which is very unusual from a<br>
biotechnological point of view and is usually inherently undesirable, results in<br>
a surprisingly homogeneous, biologically fully active pyroGlu-MCP-1<br>
15preparation, which retains its homogeneity even during lengthy storage, i.e. is<br>
more stable than the Gln-MCP-1 (starting) preparation.<br>
Bodies such as the Food and Drug Administration in the USA or the EMEA in<br>
Europe make the granting of marketing approval for a drug dependent on<br>
20meeting numerous conditions which are imposed on the drugs manufacturers<br>
with the ultimate aim of protecting the patient. Thus, the manufacturer in<br>
question has to supply proofs which demonstrate, for example, the purity of<br>
the pharmaceutical product, its shelf life and its reproducibility of production.<br>
These three aspects are only a small selection, but play a central role<br>
25precisely in the licensing of biopharmaceuticals, i.e. drugs which contain<br>
macromolecular active substances consisting of natural materials or derived<br>
therefrom (proteins, nucleic acids, proteoglycans, polysaccharides, etc.).<br>
Often, the requirements imposed on the (bio)pharmaceutical within the<br>
framework of this approval are very difficult to meet. For example, active<br>
30substances based on a protein have to be subjected to intensive and<br>
complicated multi-stage purification after their production in a more or less<br>
complex cellular organism and must not be uncontrollably altered in structure,<br>
e.g. by oxidation or other spontaneous chemical reactions. Moreover, the<br>
end product should have a reasonable shelf life so that there is no need for<br><br>
Case 1-1492-FF	14 Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH et al.<br>
complicated and expensive supply networks between the manufacturer and<br>
the prescribing doctor or patient or the clinic using the product - a<br>
requirement which is generally only met with great difficulty, particularly in the<br>
case of proteins, where it is important to maintain the correct secondary<br>
5structure (folding).<br>
In the case of the MCP-1 protein the quality of commercially obtainable<br>
preparations is frequently adequate in many respects for in vitro testing, for<br>
example. However, the inventors have found in the course of their work that<br>
l0the same preparations are by no means suitable for producing a drug which<br>
would be eligible for approval. Being left to stand in solution at ambient<br>
temperature even for a short time before being administered to the patient,<br>
which could not be ruled out in doctors' surgeries or hospitals, for example,<br>
leads to the occurrence of "breakdown" products in the MCP-1 preparations<br>
15which were originally viewed as contamination, in the experience of the<br>
inventors. More intense purification of the Gln-MCP-1 originally provided as<br>
active substance briefly restored a high level of purity, but even this<br>
preparation was again unstable when briefly stored in solution and at ambient<br>
temperature. Operating a drug approval procedure on the basis of such an<br>
20unstable active substance preparation is beset by tremendous problems, if<br>
not altogether hopeless.<br>
Surprisingly, these problems can be overcome by the teaching of the<br>
invention, wherein an unusual and at first sight highly counter-productive step,<br>
25namely incubation at elevated temperature (which was previously seen to<br>
positively promote inhomogeneity) was included in the actual preparation and<br>
purification process. In fact, when carried out under the conditions analysed<br>
in detail and perfected by the inventors, such incubation may bring about<br>
virtually quantitative conversion of the original active substance Gln-MCP-1<br>
30into the pyroGlu-MCP-1 form which was originally regarded as a contaminant.<br>
This latter form is then astonishingly stable against protein-denaturing<br>
influences such as incubation at elevated temperature and the like. Thus, an<br>
MCP-1 preparation is obtained which, by virtue of its high purity and<br>
homogeneity, exceptionally reproducible manufacture and stability on<br><br>
30Case 1-1492-FF	15 Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH et al.<br>
storage, is suitable for use as a pharmaceutical active substance which has<br>
good prospects of complying with the strict requirements in corresponding<br>
licensing procedures referred to earlier, and thus makes it possible to<br>
implement new therapeutic processes based on the activity of MCP-1.<br>
5<br>
According to a partial aspect of the invention a pyroGlu-MCP-1 preparation<br>
prepared by the process described above and in the claims is used<br>
-	for the therapeutic treatment of vascular occlusive diseases such as, in<br>
particular, coronary artery disease (CAD), peripheral arterial occlusive<br>
lOdisease (PAOD), cerebral and mesenterial arterial occlusive diseases, or<br>
-	for preparing a pharmaceutical composition for the treatment of vascular<br>
occlusive diseases such as, in particular, coronary artery disease (CAD),<br>
peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD), cerebral and mesenterial<br>
arterial occlusive diseases.<br>
15<br>
The invention thus also makes it possible to carry out a process for treating a<br>
patient suffering from the above-mentioned vascular occlusive diseases,<br>
wherein the pyroGlu-MCP-1 preparation prepared by conversion or the<br>
pharmaceutical composition prepared using a pyroGlu-MCP-1 preparation of<br>
20this kind is administered by injection or infusion, for example.<br>
With regard to the individual optimised process parameters it should also be<br>
noted that the biotechnologist will not easily be convinced that he or she<br>
should incubate a protein preparation fora fairly long period of, in some<br>
25cases, several days at elevated temperatures of e.g. 60°C. Regarding the<br>
neutral to acidic pH of the incubating solution which was previously disclosed<br>
as optimum this is contrary to chemical logic: the conversion of glutamine to<br>
cyclic pyroglutamate is a nucleophilic substitution reaction in which a pair of<br>
free electrons acts on the attacking nitrogen atom of the C-alpha-amino group<br>
30of the glutamate at the C atom of the C-gamma-amide group. An acidic pH<br>
would inherently lead to increased protonation of the C-alpha-amino group<br>
and would therefore have a negative effect on the speed of the reaction.<br>
However, this is precisely not the case, according to the inventors' findings.<br>
One possible explanation - which should not be interpreted restrictiveiy -<br><br>
Case 1-1492-FF	16 Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH et al.<br>
might be that the folded MCP-1 protein forms a micro-environment for the N<br>
terminus, in which in spite of the acidic pH of the surrounding aqueous<br>
solution the amino group is present in unprotonated form, i.e. a pair of free<br>
electrons is available for the nucleophilic attack.<br><br>

Examples<br>
Example 1: Production of a pvroGlu-MCP-1 preparation by the process<br>
Saccordina to the invention<br>
Fermentation:<br>
The fermentation was carried out with a strain of Escherichia coli K12<br>
(W3110). The strain was transformed with a ColE1 plasmid (pBR322<br>
lOderivative) containing the following elements: the genomic sequence of<br>
hMCP-1 under the control of an all-purpose promoter (phosphatase, pPhoA),<br>
a ColE1-replication origin and the resistance gene for tetracycline. For<br>
fermentation the production strain was precultured in the shaking flask in LB<br>
medium containing tetracycline. Incubation was carried out at 37°C until an<br>
15OD of 1 was achieved. The preculture was transferred into the fermenter and<br>
further cultivated with stirring and with a supply of air at 37°C. The medium<br>
contained glucose, various salts, trace elements, yeast extract, amino acids<br>
and tetracycline. The pH was maintained at 6.8 with ammonia. As soon as<br>
the glucose put in had been used up the dissolved oxygen (pO2) was kept<br>
20constant at the intended level of 40% by the supply of glucose. The induction<br>
of the phosphatase promoter took place automatically as soon as the<br>
phosphate in the medium had been exhausted. After 39 hours the biomass<br>
was harvested with a tube centrifuge (CEPA) and stored at -70°C.<br>
25Cell lysis and protein purification steps:<br>
The frozen cell pellet was resuspended in four times as much lysis buffer<br>
(200 mM Tris, 55 mM NaCI, 5mM EDTA, pH 7.5) using an Ultraturrax. The<br>
cell lysis was carried out by two passages with a homogeniser at 460 bar. Cell<br>
fragments were removed with a CEPA centrifuge. The supernatant was<br>
30optionally filtered with Polysep II (1.2 rn) filters (Millipore), and then loaded<br>
onto a column combination consisting of a Q sepharose FF and an SP<br>
sepharose FF. The columns were equilibrated with lysis buffer.<br><br>
Case 1-1492-FF	18 Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH et al.<br>
After the loading was complete the column combination was washed with<br>
lysis buffer and the Q sepharose column was clamped off. The SP sepharose<br>
was washed with lysis buffer, then with 5 M urea (in lysis buffer) and with lysis<br>
buffer again. The product was eluted in a linear NaCI gradient.<br>
5<br>
The eluate was salted with ammonium sulphate to a final concentration of 1.3<br>
mol/L and centrifuged for 15 min at 3200 g. The supernatant was loaded onto<br>
a phenyl sepharose column which was equilibrated with 1.3 M ammonium<br>
sulphate (in lysis buffer).<br>
10<br>
The flow of phenyl sepharose was applied to a Source 30 RPC column which<br>
was equilibrated with lysis buffer. Washing was then carried out with lysis<br>
buffer, water and buffer A (5% EtOH, 0,1% TFA). The product was eluted in<br>
a linear gradient from 20% buffer B (95% EtOH, 0.1% TFA) to 70% buffer B<br>
15in 10 column volumes.<br>
Conversion step:<br>
The eluate was diluted 1:10 in different buffers, e.g. phosphate buffer, 10 -<br>
40 mM, pH 6.0 - 7.4. According to a preferred embodiment a value of<br>
20between 6.0 and 6.5 was sought as the final pH of the conversion solution.<br>
The protein concentration was between 0.2 and 1.0 mg/mL.<br>
The solution was filter sterilised and incubated at temperatures of 35 - 80°C<br>
(in different batches) with gentle agitation (60 rpm). The progress of the<br>
reaction was monitored by HPLC analysis.<br>
25<br>
Final purification steps:<br>
As soon as the end of the reaction was reached, the conversion solution was<br>
loaded onto an SP sepharose HP column which was equilibrated in buffer A<br>
(40 mM phosphate, pH 6.0). Elution was carried out with a linear NaCI<br>
30gradient. The NaCI concentration in the eluate was about 350 mmol/L, and<br>
the protein concentration was about 3 mg/mL. The eluate was diluted with<br>
buffer A to a conductivity corresponding to 250 mM NaCI. Then it was further<br>
diluted with 40 mM phosphate, pH 6.0, 250 mM NaCI until the protein<br><br>
Case 1-1492-FF	19 Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH et al.<br>
concentration was 1 mg/mL The bulk solution thus formed was filter sterilised<br>
and stored at4°C or-70°C until ready to be formulated.<br>
Analysis:<br>
5The progress of the conversion step discussed above was monitored by RP-<br>
HPLC. Chromatographs of the elution profiles were taken before the start of<br>
the conversion reaction (to) and at times t = 24 h, t= 48 h and t = 120 h. As<br>
can be seen from the four chromatographs shown in Fig. 1, after 48 h approx.<br>
90 % of the protein had been converted into pyroGlu-MCP-1 at an incubation<br>
lOtemperature of 35 °C. HPLC analyses showed that the two disulphide<br>
bridges had formed properly.<br>
Fig. 2 shows the kinetics of the reaction of Gln-MCP-1 to pyroGlu-MCP-1<br>
under the conditions described. It shows that as the duration of the reaction<br>
15increases an impurity appears, which is referred to as "variant 2" in Fig. 2 and<br>
not further characterised.<br>
Similar reaction patterns were observed when carrying out the conversion<br>
step in 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, or 0.1 M sodium citrate buffer,<br>
20pH 3.5 (data not shown).<br>
The reaction described above was repeated except that temperatures of 24°<br>
C, 60 °C and 80 °C were used instead of a reaction temperature of 35°C. As<br>
is clear from the data assembled in Table 3, no satisfactory yields of pyroGlu-<br>
25MCP-1 were obtained at 24°C within a reasonable time. At 60°C and 80°C,<br>
on the other hand, significantly higher reaction rates are observed. The<br>
reaction rate at 80°C was approximately 50 times the rate at ambient<br>
temperature.<br><br>
40Case 1-1492-FF	20 Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH et al.<br><br>
n.d. = not determined, the end of the reaction had not been reached after the specified time<br>
5Certainly, a higher reaction temperature favours the formation of by-products<br>
or breakdown products, reducing the purity level - particularly when the test is<br>
carried out at 80 °C (Table 3).<br>
Fig. 3 shows in high resolution the chromatographs of the elution profile of<br>
l0pyroGlu-MCP-1 preparations which were obtained under the conditions<br>
summarised in Table 3 (20 mM phosphate buffer, 35°C, 60°C or 80°C). As<br>
can be seen from this, significantly more impurities occur with MCP-1 by-<br>
products or breakdown products at high temperatures, even with a short<br>
incubation period (e.g. 3 hours at 80°C), than during five days' incubation at<br>
1535°C.<br>
The content of (e.g. 5 %) ethanol (EtOH) in certain embodiments of the<br>
process resulting from the production method did not have a negative effect<br>
on the reaction rates or purity of the product, under otherwise constant test<br>
20conditions (20 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.0).<br>
Example 2: Production of a pyroGlu-MCP-1 preparation by an alternative<br>
process according to the invention<br><br>
Case 1-1492-FF	21 Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH et al.<br>
The fermentation, cell lysis and protein purification steps were carried out as<br>
explained in Example 1.<br>
5Conversion step:<br>
The eluate of the Source 30 RPC was diluted 1:10 with PBS, 0.02% Tween<br>
20. The protein concentration was then between about 0.2 and 0.5 mg/mL,<br>
the pH was about 7.4. In addition to the buffer components the solution<br>
contained about 3.5% EtOH and 0.01% TFA, which originated from the eluate<br>
1 Oof the previous Source 30 RPC step. The solution was filter sterilised into<br>
polypropylene flasks with a Millipak 20 (0.2 n, Millipore) and incubated at<br>
35°C with gentle agitation. The progress of the reaction was monitored by<br>
HPLC analysis. As soon as the end of the reaction was reached the<br>
conversion solution was ultradiafiltered with a Pellikon 2 UDF membrane (3k,<br>
15Millipore) against PBS, 0.02% Tween 20, and the protein concentration was<br>
adjusted to 0.1 mg/mL. The preparation was decanted in 1mL batches into<br>
glass containers through a Millipore GV filter (0.m) under sterile<br>
conditions.<br>
20Analysis:<br>
The progress of the conversion step was monitored by RP-HPLC. As can be<br>
seen in Fig. 4, after 5 days more than 90 % of the protein had been converted<br>
into pyroGlu-MCP-1, while surprisingly in spite of the long incubation period a<br>
very high purity of 95 % was obtained (Table 3). As is apparent from a<br>
25comparison of mixtures containing 20 mM phosphate buffer and those<br>
containing 20 mM phosphate buffer plus 150 mM salt (Example 1, Table 3,<br>
line 3 to line 6), the relatively low speed constant in mixtures containing PBS<br>
as incubation solution may be put down to the higher salt concentration, ionic<br>
strength or osmolarity.<br>
30<br>
Example 3: Preparation of a pharmaceutical composition based on the MCP-<br>
1 preparation produced according to Example 1 or Example 2<br><br>
Case 1-1492-FF	22 Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH et al.<br>
45<br>
The pyroGlu-MCP-1 preparation obtained in Example 1 or Example 2 was<br>
diluted to a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL in PBS (sodium chloride, disodium<br>
hydrogen phosphate, potassium chloride, potassium dihydrogen phosphate;<br>
pH 7.0), also containing 0.02 % Tween 20, and transferred into glass<br>
5containers in volumes of 1 mL The finished pharmaceutical solution was<br>
clear, colourless and odourless and can be administered by injection or<br>
infusion.<br>
Example 4: Comparison of the biological activity of pyroGlu-MCP-1 and Gln-<br>
10MCP-1<br>
Measuring principle:<br>
MCP-1 binds to and activates the MCP-1 receptor CCR2b. The activation of<br>
15the receptor leads to an influx of calcium into the cytosol. This can be<br>
measured using a Fluorescence Imaging Plate Reader (FLIPR; Molecular<br>
Devices). To do this, the inactive fluorescent dye ester Fluo-4 AM is sluiced<br>
into cells which express hCCR2b on their surface, this ester then being<br>
cleaved by intracellular esterases. In this form the fluorescent dye binds Ca2+<br>
20ions. On excitation with a wavelength of 488 nm there is an emission with a<br>
peak at 528 nm. The intensity of the emission is dependent on the<br>
concentration of calcium in the cytosol. The change in intensity of the emitted<br>
light thus correlates with the concentration of calcium in the cytosol which is in<br>
turn dependent on the state of activation of the receptor.<br>
25<br>
A characteristic time-triggered measuring signal after the addition of MCP-1 is<br>
shown in Fig. 5. It is apparent from this that after the addition of MCP-1 there<br>
is a rapid release of calcium which is linked with a sharp rise in fluorescence.<br>
The peak (b) is reached just a few seconds after the application (a). The<br>
30interval between the application (a) and maximum stimulation (b) is roughly<br>
20-30 sec.<br>
In the tests that follow, the evaluation was carried out using the maximum<br>
values as they are less affected by secondary effects such as e.g. a calcium-<br>
35induced calcium influx, and therefore more precise measurement is possible.<br><br>
Case 1-1492-FF	23 Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH et al.<br>
Preparation of stably expressing CHO/hCCR2B-K1 cells:<br>
The coding region of the human CCR2b receptor (Gene bank Accession No:<br>
5D29984) was amplified by PCR. Then the 1.08 kb BamHI-Xbal fragment was<br>
cloned into an expression vector. CHO-K1 cells were transfected with this<br>
plasmid acting as an expression vector.<br>
The cells were cultivated in a culture medium based on Ham's F12 medium<br>
lOand regularly passaged. On the day before the measurement 5000 cells<br>
were plated out in 384-well assay plates (Corning Costar) with 40 pi of culture<br>
medium and left to adhere overnight (approx. 24 h) at 37 °C, 5 % CO2, 95 %<br>
relative humidity. In all the assays the measurements were carried out four<br>
times.<br>
15<br>
On the day of the test, first of all the substance plates were prepared. Hanks<br>
buffer with 0.1 % BSA (protease-free) was used as the diluting buffer for the<br>
various MCP-1 preparations. Hanks buffer with 0.1 % BSA was used as the<br>
blank control. Then 40 l / well of Fluo-4 dye medium were added to the cells<br>
20and the preparations were incubated for 45 min. at 37 °C, 5 % CO2, 95%<br>
relative humidity. The stained cells were then washed four times with 60 ul<br>
washing buffer, leaving a residue of 25 l of washing buffer in each well. The<br>
cells were then incubated with washing buffer for a further 5 min at ambient<br>
temperature.<br>
25<br>
To measure the fluorescence the FLIPR measuring device was adjusted so<br>
that stained and unstained wells differed by at least a factor 1:5 and the<br>
stained wells had approx. 11,000 fluorescence counts. The other FLIPR<br>
settings were:<br>
30	Excitation:	488 nm<br>
Emission:	510 - 570 nm (band pass)<br>
Negative correction:	Hanks/BSA (= comparison with blank<br>
control)<br><br>
Case 1-1492-FF	24 Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH et al.<br>
Bias subtraction: 6 (= levelling all the wells to 0 before adding the<br>
substance)<br>
Presoak of the tips: with 25 ul of the relevant substance solution from<br>
the substance plate (= minimising an adhesion<br>
5	artefact)<br>
The measuring process comprised the following steps:<br>
6 intervals in a 5 sec. cycle<br>
15 ul substance added<br>
10	60 intervals in a 1 sec. cycle<br>
18 intervals in a 5 sec cycle<br>
For evaluation the maximum signal of the 78 intervals after the addition of the<br>
substance was used. The control mixtures used were:<br>
15	blank control:	for negative correction<br>
positive control (ATP):	for checking the staining<br>
reference control (standard): -monitoring the receptor expression on<br>
the cells<br>
-basis of calculation for determining the<br>
20	activity of unknown samples<br>
The samples to be tested were pipetted parallel with the reference control in<br>
identical dilution steps. The concentrations used in the tests were selected<br>
so as to be in the EC50 region of the reference control.<br>
25<br><br>
50Case 1-1492-FF	25 Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH et al.<br>
Comparison of MCP-1 preparations according to the invention and not<br>
according to the invention:<br>
Two pyroGlu-MCP-1 preparations ("Batch 0711OOkh" and "Batch 0141921")<br>
5prepared by the process according to the invention and an MCP-1<br>
preparation prepared by the recombinant method, whose N-terminal<br>
glutamine group had not been converted into a pyroglutamate group in the<br>
process step according to the invention as described above (MCP-1<br>
preparations obtainable from Peprotech) were tested and compared using the<br>
lOtest system described previously. The EC50 was determined from the<br>
measurement curves recorded as described above (see Fig. 6).<br>
Virtually identical EC50 values were obtained for the two pyroGlu-MCP-1<br>
preparations, while the values for the MCP-1 preparation not according to the<br>
15invention and not N-terminally modified differed significantly (Fig. 6). The EC50<br>
value of the latter preparation proved to be worse by a factor 2 to 3 (pyroGlu-<br>
MCP-1: EC50 = 7.82 nM; MCP-1 preparation from Peprotech: EC50 = 20.76<br>
nM).<br>
2QThe biological activity of the two preparations was calculated as follows:<br>
First, a positive correction is made to the pyroGlu MCP-1 at the concentration<br>
1e-8 M, i.e. the value obtained at a concentration of 10 nM pyroGlu-MCP-1<br>
was set at 100 %. This is in the almost linear part of the ascent of the curve.<br>
25Using this percentage signal the activity of other preparations, such as e.g.<br>
the Peprotech MCP-1 is calculated according to the formula<br>
% activity (sample) = RFU(Sampleat 1e-8M) X 1 00 % / RFU(standard at 1e-8M)<br>
30ln the above Example, as shown in Table 4, this yields a value of 48 %<br>
activity for the non-N-terminally modified MCP-1 preparation based on the<br>
pyroGlu-MCP-1 preparation.<br><br>
Case 1-1492-FF	26 Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH et al.<br><br>
5Example 5: Temperature sensitivity of pyroGlu-MCP1<br>
pyroGlu-MCP-1 was incubated for 1 or 2 hours at 56°C or 95°C. The<br>
biological activity still present thereafter was then measured using the test<br>
system in Example 4.<br>
10<br>
It was found that no denaturing occurs when a pyroGlu-MCP-1 preparation is<br>
incubated at 56 °C for either one hour or two hours. However, as shown in<br>
Fig. 7, incubation at 95°C results in a very marked denaturing effect.<br>
15Example 6: Treatment of patients suffering from an arterial occlusive<br>
disease:<br>
For treating PAOD patients a pyroGlu-MCP-1 preparation as prepared above<br>
is adjusted to a concentration of between 1.2 and 120 g/ml. immediately<br>
20before use this solution is adjusted to a final concentration of between 0.1<br>
and 10 g/ml and infused into the patient at a flow rate of 2 to 12 ml/min over<br>
a period of 1 to 6 hours by intraarterial route close to the region affected by<br>
the vascular occlusion. The infusion may be repeated after 1 to 7 days.<br>
