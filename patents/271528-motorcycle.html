Holding by the first clamp 64 and the second clamp 65 enables the switch lead wires 72 and 73 to be provided substantially straight between the clamps 64 and 65.<br>
As shown in FIG. 9, the left first clamp 64 holds the oil hose 81 and the wire 78 in addition to the switch<br><br>
lead wire 73. This allows the oil hose 81 to be supported to extend in the downward direction on the left side of the bulb 31. The right first clamp 64 holds the wires 7 6 and 77 as well as the switch lead wire 72. The wires 76 and 77 are bent in the rearward direction between the first clamp 64 and the second clamp 65 (refer to FIG. 11) . Moreover, the left second clamp 65 holds the lead wire 74 connected to the left flasher 44 and the lead wire 75 connected to the bulb 31. The right second clamp 65 holds the lead wire 7 4 connected to the right flasher 44.<br>
The third clamp 66 is disposed below the second clamps 65 and 65 and positioned below the bulb 31. The third clamp 66 holds the instrument lead wire 71, the lead wire 74, and the lead wire 75 between the frame portions 61 and 61. Additionally, the third clamp 66 is a wire member that is bent at several portions to hold the instrument lead wire 71 and the lead wires 74 and 75.<br>
The fourth clamp 67 is positioned below the third clamp 66 to hold the harness 70 and the switch lead wires 72 and 73 not only ahead of but also below the under bracket 6 in order to bend the harness 70 and the switch lead wires 72 and 73 in the rearward direction.<br>
More specifically, as shown in FIG. 9 or 11, the fourth clamp 67 includes a front holding portion 67a and<br><br>
a rear holding portion 67b. The front holding portion 67a is positioned ahead of the under bracket 6 for supporting the switch lead wires 72 and 73 and the harness 70 at that position. The fourth clamp 67 is also positioned below the under bracket 6 for supporting the switch lead wires 72 and 73 and the harness 70 at that position. In this way, the switch lead wires 72 and 73 and the harness 70 are bent in the rearward direction since they are held not only ahead of but also below the under bracket 6. Thereafter, the switch lead wires 72 and 73 and the harness 70 extend in the rearward direction along the gusset 28 to be connected to the harness 79 by the couplers 72a, 73a and 70a adjacent to the gusset 28 as described above.<br>
Moreover, the harness stay 60 supports the instrument unit 41 since the upper plate 62 is fixed to a rear surface of the instrument unit 41 by a plurality of bolts 93. More specifically, as shown in FIG. 8, a plurality of mounting holes (three in the embodiment) 62a, 62a and 62a are formed on the edge of the upper plate 62. The mounting hole 62a is fixed to the rear surface of the instrument unit 41 via a cylindrical damper 92 whose lateral ends are flared like a flange (refer to FIG. 11) . In other words, the damper 92 is fitted on an inner side of the mounting hole 62a and the flange-shaped lateral<br><br>
ends of the damper 92 are interposed not only between the edge of the mounting hole 62a, and the rear surface of the instrument unit 41 but also between a head portion of the bolt 93 and a bottom surface of the upper plate 62. Then, the bolt 93 passes through the damper 92 fitted on the inner side of the mounting hole 62a and is fixed to the rear surface of the instrument unit 41.<br>
In the motorcycle 1 described above, each of the switch lead wires 72 and 73 and the instrument lead wire 71 is provided to extend in the downward direction from the switch units 42 and 43 and the instrument unit 41 respectively on both lateral sides of the bulb 31 and then in the rearward direction. This allows the headlight 30 to be disposed adjacent to the steering head 21 compared to a case where the lead wires are provided in the housing that covers the headlight 30 from behind. As a result, the force required for steering can be reduced, which improves the operability of the handlebar 9.<br>
Moreover, the motorcycle 1 includes the right switch unit 42 disposed on the right side of the handlebar 9, and the left switch unit 43 disposed on the left side of the handlebar 9. In addition, the switch lead wire 72 connected to the right switch unit 42 is provided to extend in the downward direction on the right side of the<br><br>
bulb 31, and the switch lead wire 73 connected to the left switch unit 43 is provided to extend in the downward direction on the left side of the bulb 31. This simplifies the installation route of the lead wires 72 and 73.<br>
Moreover, the motorcycle 1 includes the instrument unit 41 disposed between the right switch unit 42 and the left switch unit 43. In addition, the instrument lead wire 71 connected to the instrument unit 41 is supported together with the switch lead wire 73 connected to the left switch unit 43. This prevents the instrument lead wire 71 from swinging due to the rotation of the handlebar 9 to the right and left. Additionally, the instrument lead wire 71 may be bundled with the switch lead wire 72.<br>
Moreover, the motorcycle 1 includes the harness 79 that bundles the lead wires connected to the plurality of electrical components (the battery 49 and the relay units 46 and 48 in this embodiment) disposed behind the switch units 42 and 43 or the instrument unit 41 disposed above the steering head 21. The switch lead wires 72 and 73 and the instrument lead wire 71 are provided to extend in the downward direction on both lateral sides of the bulb 31 and then in the rearward direction. Then, they are connected to the lead wires included in the harness 79 by<br><br>
the couplers 72a, 73a and 70a behind the steering head 21. This allows the couplers 72a, 73a and 70a to be provided behind the steering head 21, which simplifies the installation of the lead wires 71, 72 and 73 around the steering head 21 and the headlight 30.<br>
Moreover, the couplers 72a, 73a and 70a are covered with the cover 82. This allows for the protection of the couplers 72a, 73a and 70a.<br>
Moreover, the motorcycle 1 includes the harness stay 60 having the right and left pair of frame portions 61 and 61 extending vertically behind the headlight 30, and the pair of first clamps 64 and 64 each provided on the pair of frame portions 61 and 61 respectively for supporting the lead wires 72 and 73 capable of extending vertically on both lateral sides of the bulb 31. This makes it possible to stably support the lead wires 72 and 73 provided on both lateral sides of the bulb 31.<br>
Moreover, the harness stay 60 includes the second clamps 65 and 65 for supporting the lead wires 71, 72 and 73 below and away from the first clamps 64 and 64. This makes it possible to support the lead wires 71, 72 and 73 provided on both lateral sides of the bulb 31 more stably.<br>
Moreover, in the motorcycle 1, the harness stay 60 not only holds the lead wires 71, 72 and 73 capable of extending on both lateral sides of the bulb 31 but also<br><br>
supports the headlight 30. Accordingly, the headlight 30 is also supported by the harness stay 60 while the lead wires 71, 72 and 73 are prevented from swinging due to the rotation of the handlebar 9 to the right and left. As a result, the increase in the number of components can be prevented.<br>
Moreover, the harness stay 60 includes the right and left pair of frame portions 61 and 61 extending vertically behind the headlight 30, and the brackets 61b and 61b each extending from the right and left pair of frame portions 61 and 61 respectively for supporting headlight 30. The right and left pair of frame portions 61 and 61 include, on a halfway position thereof, flared portions 61c and 61c swelling to the lateral side, and the brackets 61b and 61b are provided on the flared portions 61c and 61c. This allows for the stable support of the headlight 30 that is wider than an interval between the frame portions 61 and 61.<br>
Moreover, the motorcycle 1 includes the wires 76, 77 and 78 provided from the handlebar 9 disposed above the steering head 21 to be directed to the components behind the handlebar 9 (the clutch 2a, the throttle body 14, and the choke in the above description). The harness stay 60 holds the switch lead wires 72 and 73 in addition to the wires 76, 77 and 78. Accordingly, the wires 76, 77 and<br><br>
78 are also supported by the harness stay 60 while the lead wires 72 and 73 and the wires 76, 77 and 78 are prevented from swinging due to the rotation of the handlebar 9 to the right and left. As a result, the increase in the number of components can be prevented.<br>
Moreover, the motorcycle 1 includes the oil hose 81 that extends downward from the handlebar 9 positioned above the steering head 21. In addition, the harness stay 60 holds the switch lead wire 73 as well as the oil hose 81. Accordingly, the oil hose 81 is supported by the harness stay 60 supporting the lead wire 73 while the lead wire 73 is prevented from swinging due to the rotation of the handlebar 9 to the right and left. As a result, the increase in the number of components can be prevented.<br>
Incidentally, the present invention is not limited to the motorcycle 1 described above, and various changes may be included. For example, the switch lead wires 72 and 73 and the instrument lead wire 71 extend on the both lateral sides of the bulb 31 in the above description. However, when the levers 12L and 12R include switches to be on/off in accordance with the operation of the levers 12L and 12R (for example, a stop switch or a clutch switch), the lead wires connected to these switches may extend downward on the both lateral sides of the bulb 31.<br><br>
Moreover, while the battery 49 and the relay units 46 and 48 are exemplified as electrical components disposed behind the handlebar 9, the electrical components disposed behind the handlebar 9 are not limited to these. For example, a CPU (Central processing unit) may be provided below the seat 11, and a control circuit for controlling the entire vehicle may be disposed. Moreover, the lead wires connected to various kinds of electrical components provided on the handlebar 9 may be connected to the control circuit.<br><br>
