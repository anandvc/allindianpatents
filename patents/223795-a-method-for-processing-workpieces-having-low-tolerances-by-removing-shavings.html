				<td>A METHOD FOR PROCESSING WORKPIECES HAVING LOW<br>
TOLERANCES BY REMOVING SHAVINGS<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a method for processing products having<br>
low dimensional tolerances by removing shavings.<br>
Technological Background<br>
It is known that metal materials are particularly prone to expansion<br>
phenomena when heated. It is also known that mechanical production<br>
operations for removing shavings, including in particular turning operations,<br>
produce substantial heating of the processed workpiece. This leads to the<br>
workpiece which is being processed being subjected to greater or lesser<br>
expansions.<br>
This must be taken into consideration when products having low<br>
dimensional tolerances have to be processed.<br>
In order to comply with high levels of precision during work cycles, it is<br>
known to entrust the evaluation of the dimensional variations resulting from the<br>
temperature of the workpiece to the experience of the operator, who is therefore<br>
responsible for deciding by estimation any adjustment to the finishing depths of<br>
the workpiece.<br>
However, this is a source of possible production rejects before the setting<br>
of the machine tool is at an optimum level and needs new adjustments each time<br>
the temperature of the workpiece being processed is subjected to changes, for<br>
example, owing to wear of the tool or for other reasons.<br>
As an alternative, it is known from American patent 6.449.526 to provide a<br>
machine tool, in particular a grinding centre, with dimensional control means for<br>
the workpieces being processed. This dimensional control is preferably carried<br>
out by means of an optical control effected by means of appropriate<br>
telecameras. In this manner, it is possible to detect the effective dimensions of<br>
the part being processed in order to take them into consideration when the<br>
machine is programmed or reprogrammed. This system, in addition to being<br>
particularly costly, requires at least temporary stopping of the machine in order<br>
to carry out the measurements. It is further preferable for the means for taking<br>
the measurement, owing to the sophistication thereof, normally to be located<br>
outside the machine and to be introduced only at the time of the measurement.<br>
This leads to a further increase in the production times owing to the need to<br>
position , test and then remove the measurement means.<br>
Statement of invention<br>
The technical problem addressed by the present invention is to provide a<br>
method for processing products having low tolerances by removing shavings,<br>
which method is set out so as to allow the disadvantages mentioned with<br>
reference to the cited prior art to be overcome.<br>
Accordingly.the present invention provides a method for processing<br>
workpieces having low tolerances by removing shavings, involving a processing<br>
step for finishing a surface of the workpiece being processed, characterized in<br>
that it comprises a step for detecting temperature (T) of the surface of the<br>
workpiece being processed before or at the same time as the finishing step and<br>
a step for adjusting the finishing depths in accordance with the detected<br>
temperature value. <br>
Preferably, the step for detecting the temperature of the workpiece is<br>
carried out in the step immediately before the finishing step. Preferably, the<br>
temperature of the workpiece is detected by non-contact measuring means or by<br>
optical measuring means. In a preferred embodiment, the processing by<br>
removing shavings is a turning process and temperature (T) of the workpiece is<br>
detected in the region of a processed diameter. The step for adjusting the<br>
finishing depths is preferably carried out by comparing the detected value of<br>
temperature (T) with a reference temperature (To, T1) and changing the finishing<br>
depths in accordance with the thermal expansion of the material which<br>
constitutes the workpiece being processed, taking into consideration the<br>
difference between detected temperature (T) and reference temperature (To,T1.<br>
Brief Description Of The Accompanying Drawings<br>
The characteristics and advantages of the invention will be better<br>
appreciated from the detailed description of one preferred embodiment which is<br>
illustrated purely by way of non-limiting example with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
? Figure 1 is a schematic flow chart showing the method of the invention;<br>
? Figure 2 is a schematic view of a workpiece being turned by the method<br>
of the invention.<br>
Preferred Embodiment Of The Invention<br>
With reference to the appended Figures, a machine tool, such as a CNC<br>
turning centre 1 which is arranged for processing a workpiece 2, for example, in<br>
order to carry out the finishing processing of the surface 3 thereof, is provided<br>
according to the invention with a thermometric device 4, preferably of the non-<br>
contact type, such as an optical sensor or laser type sensor of the type know per<br>
se. The thermometric sensor device 4, is directed towards the surface 3<br>
(processed diameter) so as to allow temperature T thereof to be detected in the<br>
step immediately before the finishing processing. The device 4 is also connected<br>
to a unit 5 for processing temperature signal T detected, in which, in addition to<br>
processing the signal in order to obtain the temperature value detected, a<br>
comparison is carried out between T and the expected nominal temperature for<br>
the correct processing tolerances to be obtained. In particular, it is checked as to<br>
whether or not detected temperature T falls within a range about the nominal<br>
temperature, delimited by lower limit temperature TQ and upper limit temperature<br>
T1, respectively.<br>
Temperatures To and T1 are defined in accordance with the characteristics<br>
of the material being processed, as well as the degree of precision required by<br>
the processing operation.<br>
When detected temperature T falls within the above-defined range, the<br>
processing is considered to be within normal values so that the thermal<br>
expansions of the workpiece being processed do not compromise to a significant<br>
degree the permissible dimensional tolerances. In this case, no correction is<br>
carried out to the processing parameters of the machine with specific reference<br>
to the finishing processing of the surface 3.<br>
If the result of the temperature comparison falls outside this temperature<br>
range, however, the processing unit produces a correction signal which acts on<br>
the numerical control of the turning centre 1 in order to change the depths of<br>
finishing of the surface 3 so as to compensate for the detrimental thermal effect.<br>
In this manner, a substantial level of reproducibility and consistency are<br>
obtained in the processing tolerances, even for very precise processing<br>
operations, reducing, if not eradicating, rejects owing to dimensional errors.<br>
