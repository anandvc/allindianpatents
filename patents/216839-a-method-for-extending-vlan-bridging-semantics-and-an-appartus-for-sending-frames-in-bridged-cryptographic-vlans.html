BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
5<br>
	The invention relates to VLANs, More particularly, the invention relates to a bridged<br>
	cryptographic VLAN.<br>
	DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART<br>
10	 Basic VLAN concepts<br>
	Figure 1 shows a simple port-based VLAN 10, comprised of two VLANs, i.e. VLAN A<br>
	13 and VLAN B 15. The VLAN to which an unteggsd frame rceived at a port<br>
	belongs is determined by the Port VLAN ID (PVID) assigned to the receiving port, or<br>
15	 by the VLAN ID (VID) associated with the link-layer protocol carried in the frame (see<br>
	IEEE Std 802.1v-2001, Virtual Bridged Local Area Networks Amendmert 2: VLAN<br>
	Classification by Protocol and Port). There must be a way lo convey VLAN<br>
	information between the bridges 12, 14 because they are connected by a trunk link<br>
	16 Ihat can carry frames from more than one VLAN, A VLAN tag is added to every<br>
20	 frame lor this purpose. Such frames are called VLAN-tagged frames<br>
	Trunk links<br>
	A trunk link is a LAW segment used for VLAN multiplexing between VLAN bridges<br>
	(see IEEE Std 802.1V-2001, Virtual Bridged Local Area Networksâ€”Amendment 2:<br><br>
WO 2004/042984	 PCT/US2003/034855<br>
	VLAN Classification by Protocol and Port). Every device attached to a trunk link<br>
	must be VLAN-aware. This means that they understand VLAN rnembership and<br>
	VLAN frame formats. All frames, including end station frames, on a trunk link are<br>
	VLAN-tagged, meaning that they carry a non-null VID. There can be no VLAN-<br>
5	 unaware end stations on a trunk link.<br>
	The trunk link 16 in Figure 1 is a multiplexed LAN segment shared by two bridges<br>
	12, 14. in general, many VLAN-aware bridges may be attached to a trunk link.<br>
10 	The access links 11 are LAN segments that do not multiplex VLANs. Instead, each<br>
	access Jink carries untagged frames of VLAN-tagged frames belonging to a single<br>
	VLAN. If frames are tagged then all frames on the segment carry the same V|D and<br>
end stations on the LAN segment must be VLAN aware.<br>
15 	Various limitations are encountered with the current state of VLAN art. One problem<br>
	is that of cryptographic separation of VLANs over trunk finks. The Introduction of a<br>
	schema to solve such probiem Use If raises the issue of efficient frame transfer<br>
	between encrypted and unencrypted LAN segments which represent a stngle VLAN,<br>
20 	SUMMARY Of THE INVENTION<br>
	The invention comprises Tnree extensions of Ihe IEEE 8D2.1Q VLAN bridge model<br>
	(see IEEE Sto 802.1Q-1998, IEEE Standards for Local and Metropolitan Area<br>
	Networks; Virtual Bridged Local Area Networks) . The first extension is the<br>

WO 2004/042984 PCT/US20O3/034855<br>
	Cryptographic separation of VLANs over trunk links, A new LAN segment typer<br>
	referred to herein as the encapsulated segment type, is introduced. Air frames on<br>
	such a segment ars encapsulated according lo an encryption and authentication-<br>
	code scheme. The second extension is the division of a trunk port into inbound and<br>
5	 outbound tranks ports. Thethird extension is a protocol, referred to herein as the<br>
	Transfer Point Protocol (TPP), that automatically infers for each outbound trunk port<br>
	in a bridged VLAN, a set of LAN segment types for the port that minimizes the<br>
	number of transfers between encapsulated and unencapsulated segments required<br>
	to transport a frame in the bridge VLAN,<br>

	DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
15	 LAN segment types<br>
	Tnree types of LAN segments represent a VLAN: untagged, tagged, and<br>
	encapsulated segments. The IEEE 802 to standard addresses only tagged and<br>
	uritaggecf segment types (sea IEEE Std 802.1Q-1998, IEEE Standards for Local and<br>
20	 Metropolitan Area Networks: Virtual Bridged Local Area Networks). The standard<br>
	specifies bridging semantics only for the transfer of traffic between tagged and<br>
	untagged segments representing the same VLAN. The invention provides a<br>
	technique that extends the bridging semantics to include transferring traffic between<br>
4<br><br>
WO 2004/042984 	PCT/US2003/034555<br>
	an unencapsulated segment (tajgged or untagged ) and an encapsulated segment of<br>
	the same VLAN, In general, arty number of LAW segment types can be introduced,<br>
	There is one frame type for each type of segment representing a VLAN. There are<br>
5	 three kinds of frames tn a bridged, cryptographic VLAMi untamed, VLAN-tagged<br>
	also referred to as tagged), and encapsulated. Thefirst two frarne types are those<br>
	of the IEEE 802,1Q standard (see IEEE Sid 802,1 Q-1998, IEEE Standards tor Local<br>
	and Metropolitan Area Networks; Virtual Bridged Local Area Networks). An<br>
	encapsulated frame is cryptographioaily encapsulated. Every eneapsulated frame<br>
10	 also has a VLAN teg. The tag, however. is different from the tag used within tagged<br>
	frames belonging to the VLAN. Associated with every VLAN are two unique VLAN<br>
	tags, ViD-T (used within lagged frames of the VLAN) and VID-E (used within<br>
	encapsulated frams of the VLAN).<br>
15 	For each VLAN, there is a unique security association comprising a cryptographic<br>
	authentication code key for checking the integrity and authenticity of frames that are<br>
	tagged as belonging to the VLAN, and a cryptographic key for ensuring the privacy<br>
	of all frames belonging to the VLAM,<br>
20 	The preferred encapsulation scheme Is an "encrypt-then-MAC" scheme, In this<br>
	scheme, the data pay load ot a frame Is encrypted and then a message<br>
	authentication code is computed over the restating ciphertexl and the frame's<br>
	sequence number- This schema has two major advantages: It facilitates forward<br>
	error correction when used with certain block ciphers and modes Of operation and it<br>
25	 permits frame authentication without decryption,<br>
5<br><br>
WO 2004/042984 	PCT/CA2003/034855<br>
	A tagged sel, an untagged set. and an encapsulated set of parts is associated with<br>
	each VLAN, The security association for a VLAN may be used to verify the<br>
	authenticity and integrity of every trame tagged as belonging to the VLAN, and<br>
5	 received at a porr in the VLAN's encapsulated set. The ingress-filtering rule for the<br>
	port determines whether verification occurs. The association may also be used to<br>
	encapsutete lagged and untged frames belonging to the &amp; VLAN cryptographically<br>
	before sending them from a port in the VLAN's encapsulated set,<br>
10 	Trunk ports<br>
	Every trunk port has an Inbound and an outbound port. A trunk link between two<br>
	trunk ports P1 and P2 connects the inbound port of P1 to the outbound port of P2,<br>
	and the outbound port of P1 to the inbound port of P2. Therefore 'he sets of LAN<br>
15	 segment types to which an inbound port betongs are exactly those of the outbound<br>
	port lo which it is connected. So, if is sufficient to assign only outbound parts to sets<br>
	ot LAN segment types in order to completely assign alt trunk ports in a bridged VLAN<br>
	to sets of LAN segment types<br>
20 	The inbound an outbound ports of a trunk pon can belong to different sets of LAN<br>
	segment types. For instance, the outbound port of a trunk can belong to a VLAN's<br>
	tagged set, antf the inbound port to its encapsulated sei, tn which case, only<br>
	encapsulated frames of the VLAN are received on the inbound port, and onty tagged<br>
	frames are ever sent from the outbound port,<br>
6<br><br>
WO 2004/042984	 PCT/US2003/034855<br>
	Unlike an access port the inbound of outbound port of a trunk port can belong to<br>
	both the tagged and encapsulated sets of a VLAN simultaneously.<br>
	The division of a trunk port into inbound and outbound ports is absent in the 802- 1Q<br>
5	 standard (see IEEE Std 802.1 Q-1993, IEEE Standards for Local and Metropolitan<br>
	Area Networks: Virtual Bridged Local Area Networks) where, in effect, the inbound<br>
	and outbound ports are the same port. Inbound and outbound frame types are<br>
	therefore always the same for a given trunk port in 802.1Q.<br>
10 	Figure 2 illustrates a bridged cryptographic VLAN. Ports P1 (20) and P2 (21) are<br>
	access ports, one for VLAN A 26. ancf the other for VLAN B 29, VLANs A and B<br>
	having access links 30, 31. A trunk link 16 connects the two bridges 12a, 14a via<br>
	trunk ports P3 (22) and P4 (23). P3 has inbound port P3, and outbound port P3a P4<br>
	has inbound port P4, and outbound port P40 . P4, is connected to P3XXX and P40 is<br>
15	 connected to P31. Frames received at P4 arrive on inbound port P41 and those sent<br>
	out P4 leave via outbound port P4O. Frames received at P3 arrive on inbound port<br>
	P3i arrd those sent out P3 leave via outbound port P3<br>
	Ports P5 (24) and P6 (25) are attached to wireless access links 30. In the preferred<br>
20	 embodiment, they are actually virtual ports that share a single radio interface (access<br>
	point) through which frames are sent and received via RF. VLANs A 28 and B 29<br>
	can be represented by different encapsulated segments even though they share the<br>
	same RF medium. An end station in VLAN; for exampleT can receive but not<br>
	decipher any frame belonging to VLAN 8. Therefore, distinct access links 32, 33 are<br>
25	 shown for A and 6 even though their physical separation is only cryptographic.<br>
7<br><br>
WO 2004/042984	 PCT/US2003/034855<br>
	Suppose P1 receives only unissued frames, and P2 only tagged frames. Further,<br>
	suppose the trunk link carries tagged frames in both directions, and the wireless<br>
	access links only encapsulated frames, Then for VLAN A, the untagged set is {Pi},<br>
5	 the tagged set Is {P30 P30 P40 P4, } and the encapsulated set is {P5}: and for B the<br>
	sets are { } { P2, P30 P3r, P40, P4,}, and { P6 } reapectively.<br>
	In the ingress filtering rule at P5 specifies authenticity checking, then a frame<br>
	received at P5 is authenticated using the security association for VLAN A. If<br>
10	 successful, then the frame is determined to be a member Of the encapsutated<br>
	segment for A. Suppose the frame must be forwarded to P4, Then Bridge 2:<br>
	decapsulates the frame using the same security association. The bridge forwards<br>
	the decapsulated frame to P40 with its tag repraced by A-T, thereby transferring the<br>
	frame frorn A's encapsulated segment to its tagged segment. Conversely, frames<br>
15	 arriving at P4: and destined tor P5 are encapsulated using the security association<br>
	for A. Tag A-T is replaced by A-E, which transfer the frame from As tagged<br>
	segment to its encapsulated segment.<br>
	There are many variations of the example in Figure 2, For instance, it may be<br>
20	 desirable to protect traffic on VLAN B only. In this case, P5 does not belong to the<br>
	encapsulated set for A, Only frames received at P6, i.e. frames tagged with B-E, are<br>
	authenticated, and only B-tagged frames received at P4i and destined for P6 are<br>
	encapsulated.<br>
8<br><br>
WO 2004/042984	PCT/US2003/034855<br>
	Bridging semantics<br>
	Consider a VLAN bridge having multiple ports. Suppose a frame is received at port<br>
	P- It is assigned 1o a VLAN In one of several ways. If P is a trunk port, then the<br>
5	 franw must carry a VLAN tag of the form VID-T or VlD-E, each of which identities, a<br>
	VLAN, namely VID. Otherwiser the frame is diseased. If P is not a trunk port, then<br>
	either port or protocol-based VLAN classification can be used to assign the frame to<br>
	a VLAN (see IEEE Std 802.1v-2001, Virtual Bridged Local Area<br>
	Networksâ€”Amendment 2: VLAN Classification by Protocol and Port).<br>
10 	Ingress filtering<br>
	If P is a trunk port and is not in the tagged or encapsulated sets for VID, then the<br>
	frame is discarded. The ingress-filter rule for a port may specify authentication and<br>
	integrity checking for certain VLANS. If P is a port whose ingress filter rule requires<br>
15	 authentication and integrity checking for the VLAN VlD, then the frame received at P<br>
	must have a VLAN tag VID-E. Otherwise, the frame is discarded. In 1he preferred<br>
	emboiment, an authentication code is computed over the received frame's<br>
	ciphertext and sequence number using the security association for VID. If it does not<br>
	match, the received authentication code In the frame, then the frarm Is discarded.<br>
20	 otherwise, tha frame is judged to belong to the encapsulated segment for VlD.<br>
	If P is not in the tagged set for VlD, but it is attached to a VLAN-iagged access link,<br>
	then the received frame is discarded.<br>
9<br><br>
WO 2004/042984	 PCT/US2003/034855<br>
	Forwarding process<br>
	The forwarding process begins by corisvutf ing the target port set O. This is the set<br>
	of ports to whicn a frame belonging to a particular VLAN rnust be forwarded.<br>
5	 Suppose a if farm received al port P belongs to the VLAN SAD. tf the fams must be<br>
	flooded then Q contains any ou(bound or access port that is a member of the tagged,<br>
	untagged or encapsulated sets for VID. The next step is to shrink Q if. and only if. P<br>
	is an inbound port of a trunk that belongs to both the tagged and encapsulated sats<br>
	of VID. In this case, every port in the encapsulated set of VID that does not belorig<br>
10	 to the tagged set of VID is ramovecf from a if the received frame is a tagged (name,<br>
	or every port in ttre tagged or untagged set of VID that does not be!ong to the<br>
	encapsulated set of VID is removed from Q if the received frame is encapsulated.<br>
	Bacause the inbound port belongs to both sets of LAN segmenrt types fO VlDr the<br>
	inbound port must receive a frame of each LAN segment type, and therefore<br>
15	 shriking the target port set is justified. The Transfer Point Protocol has the property<br>
	that it guarantees shrinking never results in an empty target port set. Shrinking to an<br>
	emptytarget set implies the bridge received a fram that it has no reason to receive.<br>
	The next step in the forwarding process is to construct a forwarding set for the<br>
20	 received frame. This is the set of frames to be forwarded as a result ot receiving the<br>
	frame belonging to VID at port P, These are tne frames necessary lo transfer traffic<br>
	from one LAN segment of the VLAN to another. Tne table shown in Figure 3 Is used<br>
	to construct forwarding sets. The frame received at P belongs to a Kind K of LAN<br>
	segment for VID (tagged, untagged, of encapsulated). Likewise, every pont in Q<br>
25	 belongs to a kind at LAN sggment, the kind of port set to which it belongs for VID.<br>
10<br><br>
WO 2004/042984	 PCT/US2003/034855<br>
	Trunk ports may have two KINDS OF sets: tagged and encapsulated, For every port q<br>
	in Q, add a frame to the forwarding set according to rule (K, K) in me table of Figure<br>
	3, where K' is a kind of port set to which q belongs for VID.<br>
5 	The rules for constructing the forwarding set for a received frame are as follows:<br>
	(1) Add received frame to forwording set.<br>
(2) Add VLAN tag VlD-T to received frame. add the result to forwarding set.<br>
10<br>
	(3) Received frame is cryptographteally encapsulated using the security<br>
	association for VlD resulting frame is VLAN tagged with VID-E and added<br>
	to forwording set<br>
15 	(4) Remove VID-T fromreceived frame; add urtagged frame to forwording<br>
	set<br>
	(5) Receded frame's ciphertext is decrypted using the securty association for<br>
	VID; resulting frame is untagged and added to forwarding set.<br>
20<br>
	(6) Received frame's ciphertext is decrypted using the security association for<br>
	VID; resulting frame is tagged wilh VID-T and added to forwarding set.<br>
11<br><br>
WO 2004/042984	 PCT/US2003/034855<br>
	In the presently preferred embodiment there can be at most three frames in any<br>
	forwarding set, corresponding to me three different kinds of LAN segment that can<br>
	represent a VLAN. The forwarding process forwards the frames of the forwarding<br>
	set as follows<br>
5<br>
	â€¢ The forwarding process queues for transmission at each port in Q that belongs to<br>
	the untagged set for VID, the untagged frame, if any, in the forwarding SET.<br>
	â€¢ The forwarding process queues for transmission at each port in Q lhaf belongs to<br>
10	 the tagged set for VID, the VLAN -tagged frame, if any, in the forwarding set<br>
	â€¢ The forwarding process queues tor transmission at each port in Q that belongs to<br>
	the encapsulated set for VID, the encapsulated frame, if any, in the forwarding<br>
	set<br>
15	Frame transfer<br>
	Within a bridged, cryptographic VLAN. steps are taken to eliminate redundant<br>
	transfers between LAN segments representing the same VLAN. For instance, it is<br>
	desirable to avoid transfeming an unencapsulated frame to a VLAN's encapsulated<br>
20	 segment more than once in a bridged VLAN because each transfer requires <br>
	encryption. Encapsulation should be done once and shared by all egress ports that<br>
	belong to the VLAN's encapsulated set across ad bridges. Similarly, it is desirable to<br>
	avoid repeated decapsulation across bridges because each calls for decryption<br>
12<br><br>
WO 2004/042984	 PCT/US2003/034855<br>
	For instance, consider the bridged LAN in Figure 4. Suppose the ports of Bridges 1<br>
	(41) and 2 (42) to which the wireless trunk links 43 are attached belong to the<br>
	encapsulated set for VLAN &amp; 44. if the trunk link 45 carries only VLAN-tagged<br>
5	 frames, then frames belonging to VLAN B that are received at Bridge 1 rnust be<br>
	encapsulated at Bridges 1 and 2. However, if the trunk link carries encapsulated<br>
	frames then encapsulation need only be done at Bridge 1 and shared with Bridge 2.<br>
	There are also situations where ancapsulaiion can be done too early in a bridged<br>
10	 LAN, forcing encapsulated frames to be sent over trunk links unnecessarily. There Is<br>
	a transfer point for encapsulation and (decapsulation for each VLAN that.minimizes<br>
	cryptographic operations. The Transfer Point Protocol (discussed below) infers this<br>
	transfer point between segments.<br>
	Transfer Point Protocol<br>
15<br>
	A minimum spanning tree algorithm can reduce any bridged LAN to a spanning tree<br>
	whose nodes are the bridges and whose edges are trunk links. A spanning tree<br>
	induces a partial order or bridges. For instance, we can taka as the partial order B1<br>
20	 the root of the spanning tree. The set of bridges together with the partial order<br>
	defines a complete, partially ordered set. Every nonempty subset of bridges has a<br>
	least upper bound.<br>
13<br><br>
WO 2004/042984	 PCT/US2003/034855<br>
	Consider frames received at the root of the spanning tree. The least upper bound of<br>
	all bridges requiring a received frame of a VLAN to belong to one of iha LAN<br>
	segments representing the VLAN is the transfer point for converting received frames<br>
	to frames for that LAN segment<br>
5<br>
	The Transfer Point Protocol (TPP) comprises two link-layer protocols, TPP-T for<br>
	adding outbound Trunk ports to thh tagged set of a VLAN, and TPP-E for adding<br>
	outbound trunk ports to the encapsulated set of a VLAN. The trunk ports are across<br>
	al lbridges that bridge the VLAN- For example, TPP-E determines that the outbound<br>
10	 trunk port connecting Bridge 1 to Bridge 2 in Figure 4 must be a member of the<br>
	ancapsulated set for VLAN B. That way the wireless trunk port at Bridge 2 can<br>
	share encapsulations pefformed by Bridge 1 for its outbound wireless trunk port.<br>
	TPP assumes that every access link port has been assigned to the tagged,<br>
15	 uataggad, or encapsulated set tor a VLAN prior to execution because it uses this<br>
	infortnation to infer the sets to which outboond trunk ports in the bridged VLAN<br>
	belong. TPP-E can assign an outbound trunk port to the encapsulated se oi a<br>
	VLAN, while TPF'-T can assign the same outbound port to the tagged set of the<br>
	VLAM.<br>
20<br>
	TPP has two frams types, the announce frame, and the reply frame. Each ct these<br>
	frames contains a VLAN ID and a source bridge routing path, where each entry in<br>
	the path is a unique pair containing a bridge MAC adress and three bits, one bit for<br>
	each LAN segment type, i.e. tagged, untagged, and encapsulated. The tagged bit is<br>
25 	high It and only if ihe bridge addressed in the pair has an access port in the tagged<br>
14<br><br>
WO 2004/042981 	PCT/US2003/034855<br>
	set of the VLAN named in the frame. Tire untagged and encapsulated bits ars set<br>
	likewise,<br>
	A bridge sends a TPP announce frame, e.g a GARP POU, to a TPP group address,<br>
5	 e.g, a GARP application address, through each of its outbound trunk ports for every<br>
	VLAN known to it. When a bridge receives an announce frame, it appends to the<br>
	right of the path the pair for itself regarding the named VLAN received, and forwards<br>
	the frame to each of its enabled, outbound trunk ports except the receiving trunk<br>
	port, if it has no other such ports, then il sends the final routing path and received<br>
10	 VID in a TPP reply frame to the MAC address thai precedes it jn ihe routing path.<br>
	The originating bridge of an announce frame creates a path consisting only of a pair<br>
	for itself. When a bridge receives a TPP reply frame on an inbound trunk port, it<br>
	forwards the reply frame to the bridge MAC address thai precedes it in the path. If<br>
	ihere is none, the frame is discarded.<br>
15 	TPP-E<br>
	When a bridge receives a TPP reply frame on a trunk port, it adds the trunk's<br>
	outbound port to the encapsulated set for the VID in the frame if, and only if, it is<br>
	followed by a bridge B in the routing path whose encapsulated bit is high, and either<br>
20 	a) the receiving bridge has a tagged or untagged access port for the VID and no<br>
	 bridge after it in the routing path, up to and including B, has a high tagged or<br>
	untagged bit; or<br>
	b) the receiving bridge has an encapsulated access port for the VID, or is<br>
	preceded by a bridge in the routing path with a high encapsulated bil.<br>
15<br><br>
WO 2004/042984	 PCT/US2003/034855<br>
	TPP-T<br>
	When a bridge receives a TPP reply frame on a trunk port, it adds the trunk's <br>
	outbound part lo the togged set tot the VlD in tine frame if, and only if it is fallowed<br>
5	 by a bridge B in the routing path whose tagged or urrtagged bit is high, and either<br>
	a) the receiving bridge has an encapsulated access port for the VlD and no<br>
	bridge after it in the routing path, up to and including B, has a high<br>
	encapsulated bit; or<br>
10<br>
	b) the receiving bridge has a tagged or untagged access port lor the VlD, or is<br>
	preceded by a bridge in the routing path with a high tagged or untagged bit<br>
Example<br>
15<br>
	Example 1<br>
	Consider bridging a single VLAN- Each access porttherefore is assumed to belong<br>
	to this VLAN, Thus, VLAN labeling of ports is omitted in the examples. Instead, the<br>
20	 outbound trunk ports are labeled with LAN segment types, i.e. T (tagged), U<br>
	(untagged). and E (encapsulated), U an outbound port is labeled with U, for<br>
	example, then the port belongs to the untagged set of ihe VLAN,<br>
16<br><br>
WO 2004/042984	 PCT/US2003/034855<br>
	initially, every access part, is labeled according to the kindof set to which the port<br>
	belongs for the VLAN. Trunk ports are initially unlabeled. jt is the job of TPP ro infer<br>
	labels for them. Figure 5 shows a bridging of a VLAN 50 where two bridges 51, 52<br>
	are connected by a trunk 53. Each bridge has two access ports. Because each<br>
5	 Bridge has both jntagged and encapsulated access ports, TPP infers that both<br>
	outbound ports of the trunk belong to the tagged and encapsulated sets of the VLAN.<br>
	Each inbound port also belongs to these sets.<br>
10 	Each outbound port is a member of the tagged set per rule TPP-T (b). Each bridge<br>
	infers this fact when it initiates a TPP announce frame. Therefore, both the<br>
	encryption and decryption done by each bridge is shared with the other.<br>
	Example 2<br>
15<br>
	In Figure 6, Bridge 1 (61) has an untagged access port and Bridge 2 (62) has an<br>
	encapsulated access port. Therefore, the outbound port 63 of Bridge 1 is a member<br>
	of the encapsulated set per rule TPP-E (a) whereas the outbound port 64 of Bridge 2<br>
	is a member of the tagged set per rule TPP-T (a),<br>
20<br>
	Example 3 <br>
	Figure 7 illustrates a purely encapsulated trunk link. All frames over the link are<br>
25	 encapsulated, however, no encryption is done at Bridges 2 or 3,<br>
17<br><br>
WO 2004/042984	 PCT/US2003/034855<br>
	Figure 8 shows the TPP message exchange between Bridges t (71), 2 (72), and 3<br>
	(73) when Bridge 1 (71) Of Figure 7 initiates an annouce frame for the VLAN, which <br>
	we assume for the example is named "B"<br>
5	Example 4<br>
	If Bridges 1 (71) and 2 (72) in figure 7 are interchanged, me result is the bridged<br>
	cryptographic VLAN of Figure 9.<br>
10 	Example 5<br>
Figure 10 shows a bridge 82 with three trunk ports, each connected to another<br>
	bridge 81, 83, 84. The outbound port of the trunk from Bridge 4 (84) belongs to the<br>
	tagged and encapsutated sets, whereas the outbound port of Bridge 2 (82) that is<br>
15	 connected to the inbound port of Bridge 4 is only a member of the encapsulated set<br>
TPP may run repeatedly to inter changes in transfer points, How frequently it runs<br>
	and the number of bridges it affects depends on the displacement of access links,<br>
	For example, it an end station is wireless, then movement of the station with respect<br>
20	 to the bridged LAN can result in its encapsulated access link being relocated. Unti|<br>
	TPP is rerun, there may be redundant transfers for a VLAN.<br>
A bridged VLAN may consist of bridges that do not participate in TPP. !n general, <br>
	there may be one or more cryptographic VLAN bridges with trunk ports connected to<br>
25	 legacy VLAN bridges. If each such itrunk port is viewed instead as a coflection of<br>
	virtual, tagged access ports, one port tor each VLAN tag that can be sent over the<br>
18<br><br><br>
WO 2004/042984	 PCT/US2003/034855<br>
	trunk, then TPP can still be run to infer transfer points among participating bridges.<br>
	However, there may be redundant transfers across the entire bridged LAN. For<br>
	exampler if a nonparticipating core switch were to separate two cryptographic VLAN<br>
	bridges, each having an access port in the encapsulated set ot the same VLAN, then<br>
5	 traffic between these encapsulated segments would be decrypted upon entry 16 the<br>
	core and then re-encrypted after exiting. Observe that no encryption or decryption is<br>
	needed if there are no access ports in the core that belong to the tagged or urnagged<br>
	sets of the VLAN. In this case, TPP can treat the virtual access port for each VLAN<br>
	Tag as an encapsulated access port rather than a tagged access port, Then all traffic<br>
10	 between the two encapsulated segments can traverse the core transparently as<br>
	encapsulated frames because every encapsulated frame is a VLAN-tagged frame.<br>
	Group security<br>
	A cryptographic VLAN v is defined by a group of m stations in at has a unique security<br>
15	 association The association consisists of the following:<br>
	a) an encryption Key Kv1<br>
	b) an authentication code key K' v1<br>
	c) a distribution key K"V1 and<br>
	d) m random values RTL R2.....RXXX<br>
20 	The encryption key is a symmetric key used by v-aware bridges and stations of v to<br>
	encrypt and decrypt frames belonging to v. All v-aware bridges, and stations of v,<br>
	compute and verify authentication codes over encrypted frames of v using K'v<br>
	There is one random value for each of the m stations. The /1h station of the group '<br>
	knows all m random values except RXXX. The m - 1 random values it knows are<br>
19<br><br>
WO 2004/042984	 PCT/US2003/034855<br>
	communicated to it by a v-aware bridge. Privacy ot me random values is ensured by<br>
	encryption using distribution key K"XXX while their authenticity is ensured by an<br>
	authentication code computed over the resulting ciphertext using authentication code<br>
	key K'v<br>
5 	Joining a cryptographic VLAN<br>
	Joining a cryptographic VLAN is done with a two-step protocol:<br>
		adding a new Station to tte group, and<br>
		enabling all other stations in the group to eliminate the new station later<br>
	A user's station joins a cryptographic VLAN v through a mutual authentication<br>
10	 protocol executed between the user, via the station, and an authenticates residing on<br>
	a v-aWare bridge. If mutuat authentication succeeds, A secure eprremeral channel is<br>
	created between the bridge and the new station to transfer Kv K'v and R1. R2 <br>
	Rm securely trom the bridge to the station. Then the second step of the Join protocol<br>
	executes, Otherwise, the protocol terminates immediately. In the second step, the<br>
15	 same v-aware bridge chooses a new random value Rm+1 for the new station. and<br>
	distributes it to all v-aware bridges, and station comprising v, in a broadcast frame<br>
	that is encrypted under K" v and carries an aulhentication code computed over the<br>
	ciphertext using K'v The bridge then creates a new distribution key for v and<br>
	distributes it to all v-aware bridges and to members of v, including the new station, in<br>
20	 a broadcast frame that is encrypted under K v and carries an authentication code<br>
	computed over the ciphertext uaing K'v<br>
	Although the new station can verify the authenticity of the broadcast containing its<br>
	own random value Rm+1 it is unabfe to decrypt it because ft does not hold key K"v<br>
20<br><br>
WO 2004/042984 	PCT/US22003/034855<br>
	Leaving a cryptographic VLAN<br>
	A. subgroup of stations can simultaneously leave a cryptographic VLAN v, perhaps<br>
	involuntary. Suppose stations 1....it of a group leave. When this happens, it is<br>
	detected by a v-awara bridge which then announces the departure of stations 1,..., k<br>
5	 via a single broadcast frame that includes an authentication code computed over the<br>
	frama using K'y The broadcast will notify every v-aware bridge and station in the<br>
	group that stations 1,,,., k have left. Each such bndÂ§a and station then attempts to<br>
	re key the encryption, authentication code, and distribution keys for vT each as a<br>
	fundion of the old key and the random values R,,.,., Rk'. Every v-aware bridge and<br>
10	 all remaininig stations in v will share a now eecwity aesoiciation as a result, indudiifiig<br>
	K fewer random vslues.<br>
	Every v-aware bridge always has the current distribution key for v' unlika a station.<br>
	So every such bridge always has the complete set of random values for any<br>
15	 subgroup that leaves v, thereby allowing it to always re key the keys for v. The<br>
	Situation Is different for stations however Rekeying is a function of the random<br>
	values for departing stations, values thai these stations do not have. Therefore, they<br>
	are unable to rekey. Furthermore, forward secrecy is guaranteed, A departed<br>
	station can never become a rnernber of v again as a result of subsequent rekey ings,<br>
20	 This is because rekeyiag is a function of ttis currerrt keys which means. that all Keys<br>
	arrived at thereafter will always be a function of a random value unknown to the<br>
	station. Only through rejoining vcan the station ever become a member of v again.<br>
