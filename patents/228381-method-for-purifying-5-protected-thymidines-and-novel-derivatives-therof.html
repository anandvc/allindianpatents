TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
METHOD FOR PURIFYING 5'-PROTECTED THYMIDINES AND NOVEL<br>
DERIVATIVES THEREOF<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method for<br>
purifying a 5'-protected thymidine and a derivative thereof.<br>
This invention also relates to a solvent inclusion compound<br>
of a 5'-protected thymidine compound obtained as crystals<br>
from the method of the present invention.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
5'-protected thymidines are compounds useful as a<br>
raw material for an antlsense DNA or the like, which has<br>
recently been developed.<br>
In recent years, with developments in manufacturing<br>
genomic drugs, antlsense DNA drugs or the like have rapidly<br>
been developed. Therewith, a DNA oligomer used as a raw<br>
material, and further, protected deoxynucleosldes used as raw<br>
materials for the oligomer are increasingly demanded.<br>
Regarding the pharmaceutical uses, it is necessary to use an<br>
extremely highly purified intermediate product to reduce<br>
generation of by-products formed based on impurities to a<br>
minimum.<br>
A 5'-protected thymidine has been conventionally<br>
isolated and purified by column chromatography, as described<br><br>
in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Nos. 6-507883 and 2000-264897,<br>
and Methods of Enzymol., 65 (1980). By this method,<br>
separation of impurities greatly different in their<br>
polarities or structures may be carried out relatively easily,<br>
but elimination of impurities having a similar structure is<br>
difficult. In particular, there are many cases where it is<br>
difficult to eliminate a 3' -substituted isomer that is an<br>
especially problematic impurity. In addition, since this<br>
method needs a large-scale purification device, in view of<br>
mass production and mass supply in the future, it cannot help<br>
saying that this method has a large problem.<br>
Attempts to eliminate impurities without using<br>
column chromatography have been made. As an example of a<br>
method using a single solvent, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No.<br>
58-180500 has disclosed a purification method using benzene,<br>
but in a practical use, the method gives a gel incorporating<br>
impurities rather than crystals and is, therefore,<br>
impractical. Furthermore, the method has a disadvantage that<br>
benzene, which is toxic, Is used as a solvent. Japanese<br>
Patent Laid-Open No. 11-511480 and PCT Publication No. WO<br>
200075154 have disclosed purification by reprecipitation.<br>
Reprecipitation is a method in which, after a crude compound<br>
is dissolved in a soluble solvent, the compound is<br>
compulsively repreclpitated by addition of an insoluble<br>
solvent or dropping into an insoluble solvent. Consequently,<br>
its purification ability is basically low. Moreover, it is<br>
industrially difficult to appropriately control the amount<br><br>
ratio between the soluble solvent and the insoluble solvent.<br>
In addition, where the amount ratio of these solvents is set<br>
inappropriately, it easily results in oillfication or<br>
generates a viscous precipitate so that purification is apt<br>
to end in failure. Actually, as described in Japanese Patent<br>
Laid-Open No. 60-152495, in some cases, the purified product<br>
is obtained as a viscous syrup, and, from an industrial<br>
viewpoint, this is a problem. Although some methods of<br>
forming amorphous by reprecipitation has been disclosed till<br>
now, no methods for obtaining a crystal by crystallization or<br>
recrystallization are known.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention has been completed in view of<br>
the conventional problems. Thus, an object of the present<br>
invention is to provide an efficient process for producing an<br>
extremely pure 5'-protected thymidine compound with no<br>
special facilities.<br>
As a result of intensive studies by the present<br>
inventors directed toward the above object, it has been found<br>
that, using a carbonyl compound such as butyl acetate and 4-<br>
methyl-2-pentanone, a 5'-protected thymidine compound can be<br>
obtained as a solvated complex including the solvent and be<br>
purified by a purification method such as crystallization or<br>
recrystallization, thereby completing the present invention.<br>

An inclusion solvent used in this invention for<br>
preparation of the inclusion crystals is preferably a<br><br>
carbonyl compound having carbonyl represented by formula [2].<br>
Examples of such a solvent include acetone, 2-butanone, 3-<br>
pentanone, 2,4-dimethyl-3-pentanone, 4-methyl-2-pentanone, 3-<br>

used alone in a solvent, but two or more carbonyl compounds<br>
may be combined at a mlxable ratio. Alternatively, a<br>
plurality of carbonyl compounds may be blended in advance to<br>
prepare a mixed solvent to be used.<br>
A liquid medium for forming inclusion crystals may<br>
be an inclusion solvent alone or a mixture of an inclusion<br>
solvent and a solvent not involved in forming inclusion<br>
crystals at a mlxable ratio. For example, a single carbonyl-<br>
compound solvent or a solvent mixture of two or more carbonyl<br>
compounds may be combined with another solvent at a mlxable<br>
ratio. The additional solvent used may be any mlxable<br>
solvent, for example, alcohols such as methanol, ethanol and<br>
isopropanol; ketones such as acetone, methylethylketone and<br>
methyllsobutylketone; nltriles such as acetonitrile and<br>
propionitrile; ethers such as diethyl ether, dilsopropyl<br>
ether, dioxane and tetrahydrofuran (THF); aromatic<br>
hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, cumene, xylenes,<br>
mesitylene, dilsopropylbenzene and triisopropylbenzene;<br>
aliphatic hydrocarbons such as pentane, hexane, cyclohexane<br><br>
and petroleum ethers; halogenated hydrocarbons such as<br>
dichloromethane, chloroform, dichloroethane and chlorobutane;<br>
pyridines such as pyridine, lutidine and quinoline; tertiary<br>
amines such as triethylamine and tributylamine; and polar<br>
solvents such as dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl<br>
imidazolidinone (DMI) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). A<br>
proportion of the additional solvent in the mixture is<br>
preferably up to 100 wt%, preferably up to 20 wt%, more<br>
preferably up to 10 wt% to the total amount of the carbonyl<br>
compound(s).<br>
As used herein, the term "inclusion crystal<br>
including a solvent" means that a solvent plays an auxiliary<br>
role to form a crystal structure, such that a crystal is<br>
formed in a form wherein a solvent is taken up into a crystal<br>
lattice thereof, or a complex is formed by a weak interaction<br>
between a crystal and a solvent. The inclusion form and the<br>
crystal structure are not particularly limited.<br>
The amount of a carbonyl-compound solvent in<br>
crystallization or recrystallization is not particularly<br>
limited, as far as the amount of the compound of formula [1]<br>
in the solvent is below its saturation solubility, but<br>
desirably the amount of the solvent is 5 to 150 folds both<br>
inclusive by weight, more desirably 8 to 50 folds both<br>
inclusive by weight of the amount of the compound of the<br>
formula [1].<br>
A temperature for crystallization and<br>
recrystallization are not particularly limited, but a<br><br>
temperature within a range from -10ºC to the boiling point of<br>
a solvent or a liquid medium is desired. Generally,<br>
purification can be performed more sufficiently by a single<br>
time of recrystallization. but purification at higher purity<br>
can also be realized by performing recrystallization<br>
repeatedly. A preferable liquid medium for recrystallization<br>
is that consisting of a inclusion solvent alone and it is<br>
more preferable to used the same single inclusion solvent in<br>
both of crystallization and recrystallization.<br>
A preferable aspect of an inclusion compound<br>
obtained by the purification method according to this<br>
invention may be the above compound represented by formula<br>
[6]. where n and m represent an arbitrary integer, preferably<br>
an integer selected from the range of 1 to 5.<br>
As stated above, the present invention allows 5'-<br>
protected thymidines to be effectively purified.<br>
Examples<br>
The present invention will be further specifically<br>
described in the following examples. The examples are.<br>
however, not intended to limit the scope of the invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
Preparation of a complex of 5'-O-(4,4'-<br>
dimethoxytrityl) thymidine-(4-methyl-2-pentanone) (2:1)<br>
To a stirred solution of 40.0 g of thymidine (0.165<br>
mol) in 500 mL of pyridine was added 56.0 g of<br>
dimethoxytrityl chloride (0.165 mol). and the mixture was<br>
stirred at room temperature for 3 hours. To the mixture.<br><br>
16.7 g of sodium hydrogen carbonate was added. The resulting<br>
mixture was stirred at room temperature for 30 min and<br>
evaporated under a reduced pressure. To the residue was<br>
added 500 mL of methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK). To the<br>
stirred mixture was added 500 mL of water and the mixture was<br>
stirred for 10 min. Then, the organic layer was separated<br>
and washed with 500 mL of water. The organic layer was<br>
evaporated under a reduced pressure. The residue was<br>
recrystallized from 900 mL of methyl isobutyl ketone to give<br>
a crystalline product, which was then collected by filtration<br>
The crystalline product was dried in vacuo at 50 °C to a<br>
constant weight to give 67.3 g of the product. NMR<br>
spectroscopy indicated that the crystalline product included<br>
0.5 molecules of 4-methyl-2-pentanone per one molecule of the<br>
desired product. DSC analysis showed a sharp endothermic<br>
peak (66.8 J/6) at 137 °C, indicating that the product was<br>
crystals. TG-DTA analysis showed that crystals including 0.5<br>
molecules of 4-methyl-2-pentanone after drying to its<br>
constant weight lost no weight until a temperature at which<br>
an endothermlc reaction occurred (122 to 132 °C), indicating<br>
that the solvent was not attached to the crystals. The<br>
product was analyzed by high performance chromatography<br>
(HPLC) with a reverse-phase octadecyl silica gel column using<br>
a mixture of acetonitrile/water (75/25) as an eluent and<br>
using a OV detector (254 nm), indicating a purity of 99.5 t.<br>
A major impurity was 3',5,-0-bis(4,4'-<br>
dimethoxytrityl)thymidine with an HPLC peak area of 0.3 %.<br><br>
An yield was 67 %.<br>

To a stirred solution of 40.0 g of thymidine (0.165<br>
mol) in 500 mL of pyridine was added 56.0 g of<br>
dimethoxytrityl chloride (0.165 mol). and the mixture was<br>
stirred at room temperature for 3 hours. To the mixture,<br>
16.7 g of sodium hydrogen carbonate was added. The resulting<br>
mixture was stirred at room temperature for 30 min and<br>
evaporated under a reduced pressure. To the residue was<br>
added 500 mL of n-butyl acetate. To the stirred mixture was<br>
added 500 mL of water and the mixture was stirred for 10 min.<br>
Then, the organic layer was separated and washed with 500 mL<br>
of water. The organic layer was evaporated under a reduced<br>
pressure. The residue was recrystallized from 900 mL of n-<br>
butyl acetate to give a crystalline product, which was then<br>
collected by filtration. The crystalline product was dried<br>
in vacuo at 50 °C to a constant weight to give 74.6 g of the<br><br>
product. The product was analyzed by high performance<br>
chromatography (HPLC) with a reverse-phase octadecyl silica<br>
gel column using a mixture of acetonitrile/water (75/25) as<br>
an eluent and using a UV detector (254 nm). indicating a<br>
purity of 99.6 %. A major impurity was 3' ,5'-O-bis(4,4'-<br>
dimethoxytrityl) thymidine with an HPLC peak area of 0.3 %.<br>
An yield was 75 %.<br>
