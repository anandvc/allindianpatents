				<td>PHOTOCHROMIC MATERIALS WITH REACTIVE SUBSTITUENTS<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0001]	Various non-limiting embodiments of the present disclosure relate to<br>
photochromic materials comprising a reactive substituent. Other non-limiting embodiments of the present disclosure relate to photochromic articles, compositions, and methods of making the photochromic articles, wherein the photochromic articles and compositions comprise the photochromic materials described herein.<br>
[0002]	Many conventional photochromic materials, such as, for example,<br>
photochromic naphthopyrans, can undergo a transformation from one state to another in response to the absorption of electromagnetic radiation. For example, many conventional photochromic materials are capable of transforming between a first "clear" or "bleached" ground state and a second "colored" activated state in response to the absorption of certain wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation (or "actinic radiation"). As used herein the term "actinic radiation" refers to electromagnetic radiation that is capable of causing a photochromic material to transform from one form or state to another. The photochromic material may then revert back to the clear ground state in response to thermal energy in the absence of actinic radiation. Photochromic articles and compositions that contain one or more photochromic materials, for example photochromic lenses for eyewear applications, generally display clear and colored states that correspond to the photochromic material(s) that they contain. Thus, for example, eyewear lenses that contain photochromic materials can transform from a clear state to a colored state upon exposure to actinic radiation, such as certain wavelengths found in sunlight, and can revert back to the clear state in the absence of such radiation.<br>
[0003]	When utilized in photochromic articles and compositions, conventional<br>
photochromic materials are typically incorporated into a host polymer matrix by one of imbibing, blending and/or bonding. For example, one or more photochromic materials may be intermixed with a polymeric material or precursor thereof, and thereafter the photochromic composition may be formed into the photochromic article or, alternatively, the photochromic composition may be coated on a surface of an optical element as a thin film or layer. As used herein, the term "photochromic composition" refers to a photochromic material in combination with one or more other material, which may or may not be a photochromic material. Alternatively, the photochromic material may be imbibed into a pre-formed article or coating.<br><br>
[0004]	In certain circumstances it may be desirable to modify the compatibility of the<br><br>
photochromic material with the host polymer into which it is incorporated. For example, by<br>
making the photochromic material more compatible with the host polymer, it is less likely that the combination will demonstrate cloudiness or haze due to phase separation or migration of the photochromic material in the host polymer. In addition, compatibilized photochromic materials may be more soluble in the host polymer and/or more uniformly distributed throughout the polymer matrix. Further, by modifying the compatibility of a photochromic material with a host polymer, other properties of the photochromic composition, such as, but not limited to, fade and/or activation rate, saturated optical density, molar absorptivity or molar extinction coefficient, and activated color, may also be effected. Modifications to such properties may be done, for example, to match the same properties of complementary photochromic materials or to enable the use of such compounds in hydrophilic or hydrophobic coating compositions, thin films or in rigid to flexible plastic matrices.<br>
[0005]	One approach to modifying the compatibility of a photochromic material with<br>
a host polymer is to attach a polymerizable to the photochromic material via a polyalkoxylated linking group, for example, a polyethylene glycol, a polypropylene glycol, and/or a polybutylene glycol linking group. One potential limitation of utilizing polyalkoxylated linking groups is the degree of purity of the resultant photochromic material that can be readily achieved. For example, commercially available polyglycols that may be incorporated into the linking groups of these photochromic materials may comprise mixtures of glycol chains possessing differing numbers of glycol units within each chain. Incorporation of these commercially available polyglycols into the photochromic material may lead to mixtures of compounds differing in chain lengths and molecular weights. This may lead to difficulty in purification, since one cannot readily separate out the desired photochromic materials in these mixtures.<br>
[0006]	Further, polyalkoxylated linking groups may comprise long chains containing<br>
multiple ether oxygen functionalities, which are inherently hydrophilic. While this may present certain desirable traits with regard to compatibility with the host polymer, linking groups with differing hydrophilicities, including linking groups that may be hydrophobic or, alternatively, linking groups of shorter length, may provide for different interactions with the host polymer and the resultant photochromic article.<br>
[0007]	Accordingly, for some applications it may be desirable to develop<br>
photochromic materials that may be incorporated into a variety of host polymers and which<br><br>
may comprise one or more reactive substituents having polarities (i.e. hydrophilicities or lipophilicities) that may more closely match the polarities of the host polymer. In other applications, it may be desirable to develop photochromic materials comprising one or more reactive substituent having polarities that do not match the polarities of the host polymers. In addition, it may be advantageous to develop photochromic materials comprising reactive substituents of uniform composition/molecular weight that can be readily purified, such as, by crystallization, chromatography, or other methods of purification known to one skilled in the art.<br>

It will be understood by one having skill in the art that Unking groups comprising various combinations of the groups -A-, -D-, -E-, and -G- can be synthesized by a variety of methods and the bond connections discussed below are for illustration purposes only and are in no way intended to imply a particular required or preferred synthetic approach to making the reactive substituent.<br><br><br>
[0038]	The connections between the various groups, i.e., -A-, -D-, -E-, and -G-,<br>
according to various non-limiting embodiments will now be discussed. In one non-limiting<br>
embodiment, the -A- group forms a bond with the photochromic naphthopyran and a bond<br>
with the -D- group. According to this non-limiting embodiment, the A-D bond may be a<br>
covalent bond between the carbonyl or methylene carbon of the -A- group and a nitrogen or<br>
oxygen of the diamine residue or amino alcohol residue of the -D- group. For example,<br>
according to various non-limiting embodiments, when -A- comprises a carbonyl carbon, the<br>
A-D bond may be an amide or an ester bond. In another non-hmiting embodiment, when -A-<br>
comprises a methylene carbon, the A-D bond may be an amine or ether bond. As used<br>
herein, the term "methylene" means an organic group having the structure -CH2-.<br>
[0039]	In other non-limiting embodiments, the -D- group forms a bond with an -A-<br>
group (as described above) or the photochromic naphthopyran and a bond with an -E- or -G-group. According to one non-limiting embodiment, the D-E bond may be a covalent bond between a nitrogen or oxygen of the diamine residue or amino alcohol residue of the -D-group and the carbonyl carbon of one of the carboxylic acid residues of the -E- group, forming an amide or ester bond therebetween. According to another non-limiting embodiment, the D-G bond may be a covalent bond wherein the nitrogen or oxygen of the diamine residue or amino alcohol residue of the -D- group replaces a terminal oxygen residue on the polyol residue or polyalkyleneglycol residue of the -G- group, thereby forming an amine or ether bond.<br>
[0040]	In other non-limiting embodiments, the -E- group forms a bond with a -D-<br>
group (as described above) or a first -G- group and a bond with a second -G- group. According to these non-limiting embodiments, the E-G bond may be a covalent bond between a terminal oxygen residue on the polyol residue or polyalkyleneglycol residue of the -G- group and the carbonyl carbon of one of the carboxylic acid residues of the -E- group, forming an ester bond therebetween.<br>
[0041]	As previously discussed, the physical and chemical nature of linking groups<br>
may have an effect on the overall properties of the photochromic material. For example, in one non-limiting embodiment, the linking groups of the reactive substituent may have a hydrophilic nature such that the photochromic material may be more readily soluble in hydrophilic or polar host monomers. In another non-limiting embodiment, the linking groups of the reactive substituent may have a lipophilic nature such that the photochromic material may be more readily soluble in lipophilic or nonpolar host monomers.<br><br><br>
[0042]	The linking groups according to certain non-limiting embodiments of the<br>
present disclosure may also be of a uniform length and/or composition such that the resultant<br>
photochromic material may be more readily purified, when compared to a photochromic<br>
material having linking groups of non-uniform length. For example, in certain non-limiting<br>
embodiments where the linking group is of a uniform length and/or composition, the resultant<br>
photochromic material may be crystalline and therefore may be purified by recrystallization.<br>
In other non-limiting embodiments, where the linking group is of a uniform length and/or<br>
composition, the resultant photochromic material may be readily purified by chromatographic<br>
methods or other methods of purification known to one skilled in the art. For example, in one<br>
non-limiting embodiment set forth in Example 3, the photochromic material (i.e., 3-phenyl-3-<br>
(4-morpholinophenyl)-6-methoxy-7-(4-(2-methacryloxyethyl)carbamylpiperizin-1 -yl)-13,13-<br>
dimethyl-3H,13H-indeno[2',3':3,4]naphtho[l,2-b]pyran) comprises a photochromic<br>
naphthopyran with a reactive substituent corresponding to -D-J. According to this non-<br>
limiting embodiment, the photochromic material may be purified by crystallization with an<br>
ethyl acetate/hexanes mixture to yield purple-tinted crystals. In another non-limiting<br>
embodiment set forth in Example 5, the photochromic material (i.e., 3-phenyl-3-(4-(4-(2-<br>
methacryloxyethyl)carbamylpiperazin-1 -yl)phenyl)-6,11 -dimethoxy-13,13-dimethyl-<br>
3H,13H-indeno[2',3':3,4]naphtho[l,2-b]pyran) comprises a photochromic naphthopyran with<br>
a reactive substituent corresponding to -D-J. According to this non-limiting embodiment, the<br>
photochromic material may be purified by silica gel chromatography to yield a green<br>
expanded foam solid. In other non-limiting embodiments, an intermediate in the synthesis of<br>
the photochromic material may be readily purified by recrystallization methods,<br>
chromatographic methods or other methods of purification know to one skilled in the art.<br>
[0043]	Bonding between the various linking group(s) and the group -J will now be<br>
discussed. According to various non-limiting embodiments disclosed herein, the group -J may be bonded to the linking group by a G-J bond or a D-J bond. In certain non-limiting embodiments where the reactive moiety -J is bonded to the linking group by a G-J bond, the G-J bond may have many possible structures. For example, when -J is acryl, methacryl, or crotyl, the G-J bond may be an ester bond, that is, a terminal oxygen residue of the -G- group bonds with the carbonyl of the -J group. Alternatively, when -J is 2-(methacryloxy) ethylcarbamyl or 2-(methacryloxy)ethoxycarbonyl, the G-J bond may be a carbamate and carbonate bond, respectively, where a terminal oxygen residue of the -G- group bonds with the carbonyl of the ethyl carbarn yl or ethoxycarbonyl portion of the -J group. Further, when -J is 4-vinylphenyl, vinyl, 1-chlorovinyl or epoxy, the G-J bond may be an ether bond<br><br><br>
between a terminal oxygen residue of the -G- group and the carbon of the -J group. In certain non-limiting embodiments, the -J group may be a hydrogen, such that the G-J bond is an oxygen-hydrogen bond resulting in a reactive moiety, i.e., a hydroxyl group, on the linking group.<br>
[0044]	In other non-limiting embodiments where the reactive moiety -J is bonded to<br>
the linking group by a D-J bond, the D-J bond may have many possible structures. For example, when -J is acryl, methacryl, or crotyl, the D-J bond may be an ester or amide bond, that is, an alcohol oxygen or an amine nitrogen on the amino alcohol residue or diamine residue of the -D- group bonds with the carbonyl of the -J group. Alternatively, when -J is 2-(methacryloxy)ethylcarbamyl or 2-(methacryloxy)ethoxycarbonyl, the D-J bond may be a urea, carbamate, or carbonate bond, where an amine nitrogen on the diamine residue or amino alcohol residue, or an alcohol oxygen on the amino alcohol residue of the -D- group bonds with the carbonyl of the ethylcarbamyl or ethoxycarbonyl portion of the -J group. Further, when -J is 4-vinylphenyl, vinyl, 1-chlorovinyl or epoxy, the D-J may be an amine or ether bond between an amine nitrogen or the alcohol oxygen, respectively, of the -D- group and the carbon of the -J group. In certain non-limiting embodiments, when -D- is an amino alcohol, the -J group maybe a hydrogen bonded to the oxygen of the amino alcohol residue, such that the D-J bond is an oxygen-hydrogen bond, resulting in a reactive moiety, i.e., a hydroxyl group, on the linking group.<br>
[0045]	According to various non-limiting embodiments disclosed herein, wherein -J<br>
is acryl, methacryl, 2-(methacryloxy)ethylcarbamyl or epoxy, -J may be attached to the -D- or<br>
-G- group of the linking group by condensation of-D- or -G- with acryloyl chloride,<br>
methacryloyl chloride, 2-isocyanatoethyl methacrylate or epichlorohydrin, respectively.<br>

[0047]	As discussed with respect to the various non-limiting embodiments set forth<br>
above, the reactive substituent R according to this non-limiting embodiment may be bonded to the photochromic naphthopyran PC in a variety of positions. For example, when PC is a 2H-naphtho[ 1,2-b]pyran or a 3H-naphtho[2,1 -b]pyran, a reactive substituent R may be bonded at any of the positions numbered 5 through 10 according to structures 1 or 2 above. When PC is an indeno[2',3':3,4]naphtho[l,2-b]pyran or an indeno[l',2':4,3] naphtho[2,l-b]pyran, a reactive substituent R may be bonded at any of the positions numbered 5 through 13 according to structures 3 or 4 above. In addition or alternatively, when PC is a 2H-naphtho[l,2-b]pyran, a 3H-naphtho[2,l-b]pyran naphthopyran, an indeno[2',3':3,4]naphtho [l,2-b]pyran or an indeno[r,2':4,3]naphtho[2,l-b]pyran, a reactive substituent R may be bonded to group B and/or group B'.<br>
[0048]	Further, as indicated above, the photochromic materials according to various<br>
non-limiting embodiments disclosed herein may comprises one reactive substituent R or may comprise multiple reactive substituents R, each of which may be the same or different. For example, according to one non-limiting embodiment wherein r is 2, the photochromic materials comprise two reactive substituents R, which may be the same or different, and which may be bonded to the photochromic naphthopyran PC at two of the numbered positions set forth above, at one of the numbered positions and on one of the B or B' groups, or both R substituents may be bonded to the photochromic naphthopyran PC at the B and/or B' group.<br>

Non-limiting examples of abrasion resistant coatings include abrasion-resistant coatings comprising organosilanes, organosiloxanes, abrasion-resistant coatings based on inorganic materials such as silica, titania and/or zirconia, organic abrasion-resistant coatings of the type that are ultraviolet light curable, oxygen barrier-coatings, UV-shielding coatings, and combinations thereof.<br>
[0091]	Non-limiting examples of antireflective coatings and films include a<br>
monolayer, multilayer or film of metal oxides, metal fluorides, or other such materials, which<br><br>
may be deposited onto the articles disclosed herein or a film, for example, through vacuum deposition, sputtering, or some other method. Non-limiting examples of conventional photochromic coatings and films include, but are not limited to, coatings and films comprising conventional photochromic materials. Non-limiting examples of polarizing coatings and films include, but are not limited to, coatings and films comprising dichroic compounds that are known in the art.<br>
[0092]	As discussed above, according to various non-limiting embodiments, these<br>
coatings and films may be applied to the substrate prior to applying the at least partial coating comprising a photochromic material according to various non-limiting embodiments disclosed herein. Alternatively or additionally, these coatings may be applied to the substrate after applying the at least partial coating comprising a photochromic material, for example as an overcoating on the at least partial coating comprising a photochromic material. For example, while not limiting herein, according to various other non-limiting embodiments, the aforementioned coatings may be connected to at least a portion of the same surface of a substrate in the following order from the surface: primer, photochromic, transitional, abrasion resistant, polarizing film or coating, antireflective, and abrasion resistant; primer, photochromic, transitional, abrasion resistant, and antireflective; or photochromic, transitional, and polarizing; or primer, photochromic, and polarizing; or primer, photochromic, and antireflective.   Further, the aforementioned coating may be applied to both surfaces of the substrate.<br>
[0093]	The present disclosure also contemplates various methods of making<br>
photochromic articles comprising connecting a photochromic material, according to the various non-limiting embodiments disclosed herein, to at least a portion of a substrate. For example, in one non-limiting embodiment wherein the substrate comprises a polymeric material, connecting the photochromic material to at least a portion of the substrate may comprise blending the photochromic material with at least a portion of the polymeric material of the substrate. In another non-limiting embodiment, connecting the photochromic material to at least a portion of the substrate may comprise bonding the photochromic material to at least a portion of the polymeric material of the substrate. For example, in one non-limiting embodiment, connecting the photochromic material to at least a portion of the substrate may comprise co-polymerizing the photochromic material with at least a portion of the polymeric material of the substrate. Non-limiting methods of connecting photochromic materials to a polymeric material include, for example, mixing the photochromic material into a solution or melt of a polymeric, oligomeric, or monomeric material, and subsequently at least partially<br><br>
setting the polymeric, oligomeric, or monomeric material. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that, according to this non-limiting embodiment, in the resultant photochromic composition, the photochromic materials may be blended with the polymeric material (i.e., intermixed with but not bonded to) or bonded to the polymeric material. For example, if the photochromic material contains a polymerizable group that is compatible with the polymeric, oligomeric, or monomer material, during setting of the organic material the photochromic material can be reacted with at least a portion thereof to bond the photochromic material thereto.<br>
[0094]	In another non-limiting embodiment, connecting the photochromic material to<br>
at least a portion of the substrate may comprise imbibing the photochromic material with at least a portion of the polymeric material of the substrate. According to this non-limiting embodiment, the photochromic material may be caused to diffuse into the material, for example, by immersing a polymeric material in a solution containing the photochromic material, with or with out heating. Thereafter, the photochromic material may be bonded to the polymeric material as discussed above. In another non-limiting embodiment, the connecting the photochromic material to at least a portion of the substrate may comprise a combination of two or more of blending, bonding (for example co-polymerizing), and imbibing the photochromic material to/with at least a portion of the polymeric material of the substrate.<br>
[0095]	According to one non-limiting embodiment, wherein the substrate comprises a<br>
polymeric material, incorporating the photochromic material with at least a portion of a substrate comprises a cast-in-place method. According to this non-limiting embodiment, the photochromic material may be mixed with a polymeric solution or melt, or other oligomeric and/or monomeric solution or mixture, which is subsequently cast into a molding having a desired shape and at least partially set to form the substrate. Further, although not required according to this non-limiting embodiment, a photochromic material can be bonded to the polymeric material.<br>
[0096]	According to another non-limiting embodiment, wherein the substrate<br>
comprises a polymeric material, connecting the photochromic material to at least a portion of a substrate comprises in-mold casting. According to this non-limiting embodiment, a coating composition comprising the photochromic material, which may be a liquid coating composition or a powder coating composition, is applied to the surface of a mold and at least partially set. Thereafter, a polymer solution or melt, or oligomer or monomeric solution or<br><br>
mixture is cast over the coating and at least partially set. After setting, the substrate with the -fearing is removed from the mold.<br>
[0097]	According to still another non-limiting embodiment, wherein the substrate<br>
comprises a polymeric material or an inorganic material such as glass, connecting the photochromic material to at least a portion of a substrate comprises applying an at least partial coating or lamination comprising the photochromic material to at least a portion of the substrate. Non-limiting examples of suitable coating methods include spin coating, spray coating (e.g., using a liquid or powder coating), curtain coating, roll coating, spin and spray coating, and over-molding. For example, according to one non-limiting embodiment, the photochromic material may be connected to the substrate by over-molding. According to this non-limiting embodiment, a coating composition comprising the photochromic material (which may be a liquid coating composition or a powder coating composition as previously discussed) is applied to a mold and the substrate is then placed into the mold such that the substrate contacts the coating causing it to spread over at least a portion of the surface of the substrate. Thereafter, the coating composition is at least partially set and the coated substrate is removed from the mold. Alternatively, over-molding may be done by placing the substrate into a mold such that an open region is defined between the substrate and the mold, and thereafter injecting a coating composition comprising the photochromic material into the open region. Thereafter, the coating composition can be at least partially set and the coated substrate is removed from the mold.<br>
[0098]	According to yet another non-limiting embodiment, a film comprising the<br>
photochromic material may be adhered to a portion of the substrate, with or without an<br>
adhesive and/or the application of heat and pressure. Thereafter, if desired, a second<br>
substrate may be applied over the first substrate and the two substrates may be laminated<br>
together (i.e., by the application of heat and pressure) to form an element wherein the film<br>
comprising the photochromic material is interposed between the two substrates. Methods of<br>
forming films comprising a photochromic material may include, for example and without<br>
limitation, combining a photochromic material with a polymeric solution or oligomeric<br>
solution or mixture, casting or extruding a film therefrom, and, if required, at least partially<br>
setting the film. Additionally or alternatively, a film may be formed (with or without a<br>
photochromic material) and imbibed with the photochromic material (as discussed above).<br>
[0099]	Further, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the photochromic<br>
compositions, photochromic articles, and photochromic coating compositions according to various non-limiting embodiments disclosed herein may further comprise other additives that<br><br>
aid in the processing and/or performance of the composition. For example, and without limitation, such additives may include complementary photochromic materials, photoinitiators, thermal initiators, polymerization inhibitors, solvents, light stabilizers (such as, but not limited to, ultraviolet light absorbers and light stabilizers, such as hindered amine light stabilizers (HALS)), heat stabilizers, mold release agents, rheology control agents, leveling agents (such as, but not limited to, surfactants), free radical scavengers, or adhesion promoters (such as hexanediol diacrylate and coupling agents).<br>
[0100]	Each of the photochromic materials described herein may be used in amounts<br>
(or in a ratio) such that a substrate or a polymeric material to which the photochromic material is associated, i.e., blended, co-polymerized or otherwise bonded, coated and/or imbibed, exhibits a desired resultant color, e.g., substantially clear and colorless when the photochromic material is in the closed form and substantially colored when activated by actinic radiation and the photochromic material is in the open form.<br>
[0101]	The amount of the photochromic naphthopyrans of the present disclosure to be<br>
connected to or incorporated into a coating composition, polymeric material, substrate, photochromic composition, and/or photochromic articles is not critical provided that a sufficient amount is used to produce the desired optical effect. Generally, such amount may be described as a "photochromic amount". The particular amount of photochromic material used may depend on a variety of factors such as, the absorption characteristics of the photochromic material used, the intensity of color desired upon irradiation thereof, and the method used to incorporate or apply the photochromic material.<br>
[0102]	The relative amounts of the aforesaid photochromic materials used in the<br>
various methods of the non-limiting embodiments of the present disclosure will vary and depend,' in part, upon the relative intensities of the color of the activated species of such materials, the ultimate color desired, the molar absorption coefficient (of "extinction coefficient") for actinic radiation, and the method of application to the polymeric material or substrate. Generally, the amount of total photochromic material incorporated into or connected to a polymeric material or substrate may range from about 0.05 to about 5.0 milligrams per square centimeter of the surface to which the photochromic material is incorporated into or connected to. The amount of photochromic material incorporated into or connected to a coating composition may range from 0.1 to 40 weight percent based on the weight of the liquid coating composition. The amount of photochromic material incorporated into, i.e., blended with, co-polymerized with, or bonded to, a host polymer photochromic composition or photochromic article, such as by a in cast-in-place type method, may range<br><br>
from 0.01 to 40 weight percent based on the weight of the polymeric composition or photochromic article.<br>

Example 10: Synthesis of Photochromic Polymer Test Square and Photochromic Performance Testing<br>
Photochromic Performance Testing<br>
[0133]	The photochromic performance of the photochromic materials of Examples 1-<br>
9 was tested as follows.<br>
[0134]	A quantity of the photochromic material to be tested calculated to yield a 1.5 x<br>
10-3 molal solution was added to a flask containing 50 grams of a monomer blend of 4 parts ethoxylated bisphenol A dimethacrylate (BPA 2EO DMA), 1 part poly(ethylene glycol) 600 dimethacryiate, and 0.033 weight percent 2,2'-azobis(2-methyl propionitrile) (AIBN)- The photochromic material was dissolved into the monomer blend by stirring and gentle heating. After a clear solution was obtained, it was poured into a flat sheet mold having the interior dimensions of 2.2 mm x 6 inches (15.24 cm) x 6 inches (15.24 cm). The mold was sealed and placed in a horizontal airflow, programmable oven programmed to increase the<br><br>
temperature from 40°C to 95°C over a 5 hour interval, hold the temperature at 95°C for 3 Hours and then lower it to 60°C for at least 2 hours. The methacrylate terminated photochromic dyes were copolymerized into the sheet after this period of time. After the mold was opened, the polymer sheet was cut using a diamond blade saw into 2 inch (5.1 cm) test squares.<br>
[0135]	The photochromic test squares prepared as described above were tested for<br>
photochromic response on an optical bench. Prior to testing on the optical bench, the photochromic test squares were exposed to 365 nm ultraviolet light for about 15 minutes to cause the photochromic material to transform from the unactivated (or bleached) state to an activated (or colored) state, and then placed in a 76°C oven for about 15 minutes to allow the photochromic material to revert back to the bleached state. The test squares were then cooled to room temperature, exposed to fluorescent room lighting for at least 2 hours, and then kept covered (that is, in a dark environment) for at least 2 hours prior to testing on an optical bench maintained at 24°C. The bench was fitted with a 300-watt xenon arc lamp, a remote controlled shutter, a KG-2 filter acting as a heat sink for the arc lamp, and neutral density filter(s). The sample holder in which the square to be tested was situated in a water bath which was kept at 23°C. A collimated beam of light from a tungsten lamp was passed through the square at a small angle (approximately 30°) normal to the square. After passing through the square, the light from the tungsten lamp was directed to a collection sphere, avoiding collecting scattered light and reblend light beam. From the collection sphere the light travels via a fiber optic cable to an Ocean Optics S2000 spectrophotometer where the resulting spectrum was measured at the visible lambda max (",max.vis") of the photochromic material being tested. The max.vis is the wavelength in the visible spectrum at which the maximum absorption of the activated (colored) form of the photochromic compound in a test square occurs. The ,max.vis wavelength was determined by testing the photochromic test squares in a Varian Gary 4000 UV-Visible spectrophotometer. The output signals from the detector were processed by a radiometer.<br>
[0136]	The saturated optical density ("Sat'd OD") for each test square was<br>
determined by opening the shutter from the xenon lamp and measuring the transmittance after exposing the test chip to UV radiation for 30 minutes. The xenon beam is set to 1 W/m2 for measurements of this class of dyes, however, in some instances, a power setting of 3 W/m2 was used. Irradiance was adjusted by varying the neutral density filter at the light source and by adjusting lamp output. The First Fade Half Life ("T1/2") is die time interval in seconds for<br><br>
the absorbance of the activated form of the photochromic material in the test squares to reach one half the Sat'd OD absorbance value at room temperature (24°C), after removal of the source of activating light. Results for the photochromic materials tested are listed below in Table 1.<br>
