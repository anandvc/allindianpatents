Herbicidal composition<br>
The present invention relates to novel selectively herbicidal compositions for controlling grasses and weeds in crops of useful plants, especially in crops of cotton, sugar cane and rice that comprise a herbicide and a safener (counter-agent, antidote) and that protect the useful plants but not the weeds against the phytotoxic action of the herbicide, and to the use of such a composition for weed control in crops of useful plants.<br>
The use of herbicides can result in considerable damage also being caused to cultivated plants, for example in dependence upon the concentration of the herbicide and the mode of its application, the cultivated plant, the nature of the soil and the climatic conditions, such as period of exposure to light, temperature and amounts of precipitation. In order to counter those and similar problems, various substances have already been proposed as safeners that are capable of antagonising the damaging action of the herbicide on the cultivated plant, that is to say of protecting the cultivated plant from that action, while the herbicidal action on the weeds to be controlled is virtually unimpaired. It has been found that the proposed safeners often have a very specific action both in respect of the cultivated plants and in respect of the herbicide and in some cases also in dependence upon the mode of application. This means that a specific safener is often suitable only for a specific cultivated plant and a particular class of herbicide or a specific herbicide.<br>
It has now been found that certain compounds from the class of the triazines, which are known perse for their good herbicidal action, at low rates of application are outstandingly suitable for protecting cultivated plants against the phytotoxic action of a certain class of sulfonylurea herbicides.<br>
It is known from US-A-6 180 563 that mixtures of such triazines with sulfonylureas exhibit a synergistic herbicidal action, that is to say the herbicidal action of the sulfonylurea on the weeds is enhanced in a superadditive manner by the addition of the triazine herbicide.<br>
It is therefore extremely surprising that such triazines, at herbicidally ineffective rates of application, are suitable as safeners for certain sulfonylurea herbicides.<br><br>
According to the invention, therefore, there is proposed a selectively herbicidal composition which, in addition to comprising customary inert formulation adjuvants, such as carriers, solvents and wetting agents, comprises as active ingredient a mixture of<br>
a)	a herbicidally effective amount of a herbicide of formula I,<br><br>
wherein<br>
M is an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal;<br>
n is 1 or 2;<br>
r and s are each independently of the other 0, 1/2,1, 11/2, 2, 21/2 or 3; and<br>
L is ethyl acetate, acetonitrile, dimethyl sulfoxide, dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide,<br>
N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, acetone, butanone, methylene chloride, trichloromethane, trichloro-<br>
ethane, tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether, 1,2-dimethoxyethane, dioxane, methyl tert-butyl ether,<br>
chlorobenzene, toluene or xylene, and<br>
b)	a herbicide-antagonistically effective amount of a compound of formula 11<br><br>
wherein R1 is chlorine, methoxy or methylthio, R2 is ethyl or isopropyl and R3 is ethyl, isopropyl, -C(CN)(CH3)-CH3 or tert-butyl.<br>
M as an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal in the context of the present invention is preferably sodium, potassium, magnesium or calcium. The present invention includes all crystal modifications that can be formed by the compounds of formula I.<br><br>

Preference is also given to compounds of formula I wherein M is sodium, n is 1, r is 0 and s is 0.<br>

The compounds of formulae lla and III can be used in equivalent stoichiometric amounts, but a slight excess of isocyanate may be advantageous.<br>
The preparation of the starting compound of formula lla is described, for example, in EP-A-0 232 067, page 29. The compounds of formula III can be prepared, for example, by converting a compound of formula IV<br><br>
wherein R1 is -CH2-phenyl or isopropyl, by aqueous chiorination into the compound of formula V<br><br>
That compound is treated with aqueous ammonia and the resulting sulfonamide is then reacted with 30 % sodium methanolate. Such reactions are known and will be familiar to the person skilled in the art.<br>
Preferred crystal modifications of the compounds of formula I are prepared as follows:<br>
For example, the J modification of the compound of formula I wherein M is sodium, n is 1, L is tetrahydrofuran, r is 1/2 and s is 0 is prepared by adding a 5-25 % by weight solution of 4,6-dimethoxy-pyrimidine-2-isocyanate in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran at a temperature of<br><br>
35-65°C to a 15-35 % by weight suspension of 3-(2-trifluoroethoxy)-pyridinyl-sulfonamide sodium salt in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran.<br>
After the addition of the 4,6-dimethoxy-pyrimidine-2-isocyanate, the reaction mixture is stirred until the conversion is complete. This process is preferably carried out at a temperature of 40-50°C. The J modification so obtained can be separated from the reaction mixture by filtration.<br>
The process for the preparation of the K modification of the compound of formula I wherein M is sodium, n is 1, r is 0 and s is 0 is carried out as follows: a 5-25 % by weight solution of 4,6-dimethoxy-pyrimidine-2-isocyanate in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran is added at a temperature of 35-65°C to a 15-35 % by weight suspension of 3-(2-trifluoroethoxy)-pyridinyl-sulfon-amide sodium salt in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran, filtration is carried out and the filtration residue (J modification) is then dried at a temperature of 30-90°C and a pressure of from 0.01 to 0.1 bar.<br>
After the addition of the 4,6-dimethoxy-pyrimidine-2-isocyanate, the reaction mixture is stirred until the conversion is complete. For the drying, in this process variant a temperature of 40-60°C and a pressure of from 0.02 to 0.06 bar is preferred.<br>
The process for the preparation of the C modification of the compound of formula I wherein M is sodium, n is 1, r is 0 and s is 1 is carried out as follows: either the substantially amorphous form (A modification) is exposed to air of 98 % relative humidity, or water is added to the K modification in a ratio of water to K modification of from 0.1 : 1 to 0.4 : 1, filtration is carried out and the filtration residue is then dried at a temperature of 30-90°C and a pressure of from 0.01 to 0.1 bar.<br>
For the preparation of the C modification, the ratio of water to K modification may vary from 0.1 : 1 to 0.4 : 1; a ratio of from 0.1 : 1 to 0.3 : 1 is especially preferred. The addition of water can take place at a temperature of 0-60°C, especially at a temperature of 5-40°C. The drying of the C modification is preferably carried out at a temperature of 40-60°C and a pressure of 0.02-0.06 bar.<br><br>
The C modification can advantageously also be prepared by adding N-[(4,6-dimethoxy-2-pyrimidinyl)carbamoyl]-3-(2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy)-pyridine-2-sulfonamide to an aqueous sodium hydroxide solution, then concentrating by evaporation in vacuo at a temperature of 50°C, stirring the residue so obtained with diethyl ether, filtering, drying at temperatures of &gt;120°C and then exposing the resulting substantially amorphous salt (A modification) to air of 98 % relative humidity.<br>
The process for the preparation of the I modification of the compound of formula I wherein M is sodium, n is 1, L is tetrahydrofuran, r is 1 and s is 1 is carried out as follows: a 5-25 % by weight solution of 4,6-dimethoxy-pyrimidine-2-isocyanate in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran is added at a temperature of from 0 to 30°C to a 10-35 % by weight suspension of 3"(2-tri-fluoroethoxy)-pyridinylsulfonamide sodium salt in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran and then 1-20 molar equivalents of water relative to the 3-(2-trifluoroethoxy)-pyridinylsulfonamide sodium salt are added. In this variant the addition of 2-5 molar equivalents of water is especially preferred.<br>
The process for the preparation of the B modification of the compound of formula I wherein M is sodium, n is 1, r is 0 and s is 1 is carried out as follows: water is added to the compound of formula I wherein M is sodium, n is 1 and L, r and s are as defined for formula I in a ratio of water to that compound of from 0.5 :1 to 20 :1, filtration is carried out and the filtration residue is dried at a temperature of 30-90°C and a pressure of from 0.01 to 0.1 bar.<br>
A preferred variant of the process for the preparation of the B modification is carried out as follows: water is added to the compound of formula I wherein M is sodium, n is 1, r is 0 and s is 0 (K modification), or to the compound of formula I wherein M is sodium, n is 1, L is tetrahydrofuran, r is 1/2 and s is 0 (J modification), or to the compound of formula I wherein M is sodium, n is 1, L is tetrahydrofuran, r is 1 and s is 1 (I modification), or to the compound of formula I wherein M is sodium, n is 1, r is 0 and s is 1 (C modification), in a ratio of water to K, J, I or C modification of from 0.5 :1 to 20 :1, filtration is carried out and the filtration residue is then dried at a temperature of 30-90°C and a pressure of from 0.01 to 0.1 bar.<br>
The temperature for the addition of water can vary from 0 to 80°C; a temperature of 5-40°C is especially preferred. The drying of the filtration residue can be carried out at temperatures of 30-90°C and a pressure of from 0.01 to 0.1 bar; a temperature of 40-60°C and a pressure<br><br>
of 0.02-0.06 bar is preferred.  It is especially advantageous to add seed crystals of the B modification to the suspension in order to accelerate crystal growth.<br>
Compounds of formula I and their preparation are described, for example, in WO 00/52006. Compounds of formula II are described, for example, in the Pesticide Manual, eleventh ed., British Crop Protection Council, 1997, under Entry Nos. 34, 692, 651, 693, 168 and 20.<br>
The invention relates also to a method for the selective control of weeds in crops of useful plants, which comprises treating the useful plants or seeds or cuttings thereof or the area under cultivation simultaneously or separately with a herbicidally effective amount of the herbicide of formula I and a herbicide-antagonistically effective amount of the safener of formula II.<br>
The composition according to the invention is suitable especially for controlling weeds in crops of useful plants, such as cereals, rape, sugar beet, sugar cane, plantation crops, rice, cotton, maize and soybeans, more especially cotton, sugar cane and rice, and for nonselective weed control.<br>
Crops are to be understood as also including those crops which have been rendered tolerant to herbicides or classes of herbicides by conventional methods of breeding or by genetic engineering, such as, for example, crops that are resistant to glyphosate, HPPD-inhibitors or ALS-inhibitors.<br>
The weeds to be controlled may be both monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous weeds, e.g. Stellaria, Nasturtium, Agrostis, Digitaria, Avena, Setaria, Sinapis, Lolium, Solanum, Echinochloa, Scirpus, Monochoria, Sagittaria, Bromus, Alopecurus, Sorghum halepense, Rottboellia, Cyperus, Abutilon, Sida, Xanthium, Amaranthus, Chenopodium, Ipomoea, Chrysanthemum, Galium, Viola and Veronica.<br>
Areas under cultivation are to be understood as including land where the crop plants are already growing or where seed material of those crop plants has already been sown as well as land intended for the cultivation of those crop plants.<br><br>
Depending upon the intended use, a safener of formula II can be used for pretreating the seed material of the crop plant (dressing the seed or cuttings) or introduced into the soil before or after sowing.  It can, however, also be applied alone or together with the herbicide after emergence of the plants. The treatment of the plants or the seed material with the safener can therefore take place in principle independently of the time of application of the herbicide. The treatment of the plant may, however, be carried out also by simultaneous application of herbicide and safener (e.g. in the form of a tank mixture). The rate of application of safener relative to herbicide is largely dependent upon the mode of application.<br>
In the case of a field treatment, which is carried out either using a tank mixture comprising a combination of safener and herbicide or by separate application of safener and herbicide, the ratio of safener to herbicide is generally from 10:1 to 1:100, especially from 1:1 to 1:10, more especially from 1:4 to 1:9.<br>
For their known use as herbicides, the compounds of formula II are used at rates of application of about from 0.8 to 2.5 kg (recommended rate of application for prometryn according to the Pesticide Manual, eleventh ed., British Crop Protection Council, 1997).<br>
In the composition according to the invention, however, the compounds of formula II are used in much lower, herbicidally ineffective amounts. As a rule, according to the invention from 0.0005 to 0.01 kg/ha, especially from 0.0005 to 0.007 kg of compound of formula ll/ha, preferably from 0.0005 to 0.005 kg of compound of formula ll/ha, is applied in the case of field treatment.<br>
The rates of application of herbicide are generally from 0.0005 to 0.05 kg/ha, but especially from 0.001 to 0.01 kg/ha.<br>
In especially preferred herbicidal compositions according to the invention, the compounds of formula I and of formula II are applied in a total amount of from 0.003 to 0.008 kg/ha, especially from 0.004 to 0.0075 kg/ha.<br>
The compositions according to the invention are suitable for all methods of application customary in agriculture, such as, for example, pre-emergence application, post-emergence application and seed dressing. In the case of seed dressing, generally from 0.001 to 10 g of<br><br>
safener/kg of seed, especially from 0.05 to 2 g of safener/kg of seed, are applied. If the safener is applied in liquid form, by seed soaking, shortly before sowing, it is advantageous to use safener solutions containing the active ingredient in a concentration of from 1 to 10 000 ppm, especially from 100 to 1000 ppm.<br>
For application, the safeners of formula II or combinations of such safeners with the herbicides of formula I are advantageously processed together with the adjuvants customary in formulation technology into formulations, for example into emulsifible concentrates, coatable pastes, directly sprayable or dilutable solutions, dilute emulsions, wettable powders, soluble powders, dusts, granules or microcapsules. Such formulations are described, for example, on pages 9 to 13 of WO 97/34485. The formulations are prepared in known manner, for example by intimately mixing and/or grinding the active ingredients with liquid or solid formulation adjuvants such as, for example, solvents or solid carriers. It is also possible additionally to use surface-active compounds (surfactants) in the preparation of the formulations. Solvents and solid carriers suitable for that purpose include, for example, those mentioned on page 6 of WO 97/34485.<br>
Depending upon the nature of the compound of formula I to be formulated, suitable surface-active compounds are non-ionic, cationic and/or anionic surfactants and surfactant mixtures having good emulsifying, dispersing and wetting properties. Examples of suitable anionic, non-ionic and cationic surfactants are listed, for example, on pages 7 and 8 of WO 97/34485. In addition, the surfacta nts conventionally employed in formulation technology, which are described, inter alia, in "McCutcheon's Detergents and Emulsifiers Annual" MC Publishing Corp., Ridgewood New Jersey, 1981, Stache, H., "Tensid-Taschenbuch", Carl Hanser Verlag, Munich/Vienna 1981, and M. and J. Ash, "Encyclopedia of Surfactants", Vol. I-III, Chemical Publishing Co., New York, 1980-81, are also suitable for the preparation of the herbicidal compositions according to the invention.<br>
The herbicidal formulations generally contain from 0.1 to 99 % by weight, especially from 0.1 to 95 % by weight, of active ingredient mixture comprising a compound of formula I with a compound of formula II, from 1 to 99.9 % by weight of a solid or liquid formulation adjuvant, and from 0 to 25 % by weight, especially from 0.1 to 25 % by weight, of a surfactant. Whereas commercial products will preferably be formulated as concentrates, the end user will normally employ dilute formulations.<br><br>
The compositions may also comprise further ingredients, such as stabilisers, for example vegetable oils or epoxidised vegetable oils (epoxidised coconut oil, rape oil or soybean oil), anti-foams, for example silicone oil, preservatives, viscosity regulators, binders, tackifiers, and also fertilisers or other active ingredients. Various methods and techniques come into consideration for the use of safeners of formula II, or compositions containing them, for protecting cultivated plants against the damaging effects of herbicides of formula I, for example the following: i) Seed dressing<br>
a)	Dressing the seeds with a wettable powder formulation of a compound of formula II by shaking in a vessel until the formulation is evenly distributed over the surface of the seeds (dry dressing).<br>
b)	Dressing the seeds with an emulsifiable concentrate of the compound of formula il in accordance with method a) (wet dressing).<br>
c)	Dressing by immersing the seed material in a liquor containing from 100 to 1000 ppm of the compound of formula II for from 1 to 72 hours and optionally subsequently drying the seed (immersion dressing).<br>
ii) Application in the form of a tank mixture<br>
A liquid formulation of a mixture of antidote and herbicide (in a respective quantity ratio of<br>
from 10:1 to 1:100) is used, the rate of application of herbicide being from 0.0005 to 0.5 kg<br>
per hectare. Such tank mixtures are applied before or after sowing.<br>
iii) Application to the seed furrow<br>
The compound of formula II is introduced into the open, sown seed furrow in the form of an<br>
emulsifiable concentrate, wettable powder or granules. When the seed furrow has been<br>
covered over, the herbicide is applied by the pre-emergence method in customary manner.<br>
iv) Controlled release of active ingredient<br>
A solution of the compound of formula II is applied to granular mineral carriers or<br>
polymerised granules (urea/formaldehyde) and dried. If desired, a coating can be applied<br>
(coated granules), which allows the active ingredient to be released in metered amounts<br>
over a specific period of time.<br>
Preferred formulations have especially the following compositions (% = percent by weight; "active ingredient mixture" denotes the mixture of compound of formula I with compound of formula II):<br><br>
Dusts:<br>
active ingredient mixture:	0.1 to 10%, preferably 0.1 to 5%<br>
solid carrier:	99.9 to 90%, preferably 99.9 to 99%<br>
Suspension concentrates:<br>
active ingredient mixture:	5 to 75%, preferably 10 to 50%<br>
water:	94 to 24%, preferably 88 to 30%<br>
surfactant:	1 to 40%, preferably 2 to 30%<br>
Wettable powders:<br>
active ingredient mixture:	0.5 to 90%, preferably 1 to 80%<br>
surfactant:	0.5 to 20%, preferably 1 to 15%<br>
solid carrier:	5 to 95%, preferably 15 to 90%<br>
Granules:<br>
active ingredient mixture:	0.1 to 30%, preferably 0.1 to 15%<br>
solid carrier:	99.5 to 70%, preferably 97 to 85%<br>
The following Examples further illustrate, but do not limit, the invention.<br><br><br><br>
The active ingredient is thoroughly mixed with the adjuvants and the mixture is thoroughly ground in a suitable mill, yielding wettable powders which can be diluted with water to give suspensions of any desired concentration.<br><br><br>
e.g. CaCO3 or SiO2<br>
The finely ground active ingredient is applied uniformly, in a mixer, to the carrier moistened<br>
with polyethylene glycol. Non-dusty coated granules are obtained in this manner.<br><br>
The finely ground active ingredient is intimately mixed with the adjuvants, yielding a suspension concentrate from which suspensions of any desired concentration can be obtained by dilution with water.<br>
It is often more practical for the compound of formula I and the mixing partner of formula II to be formulated separately and then to be combined in the applicator in the desired mixing ratio in the form of a "tank mixture" in water shortly before application.<br><br>

The measurement of the X-ray powder patterns is carried out with a Guinier camera FR 552 from Enraf-Nonius using GuKalphal radiation. The patterns registered on X-ray film are evaluated with a Line-Scanner LS-18 from Johansson using Scanpi-Software.<br><br>
The ability of the compounds of formula II to protect cultivated plants against the phytotoxic action of herbicides of formula I is illustrated in the following Examples.<br>
Biological Examples<br>
Example B1: Post-emergence test:<br>
The test plants are grown in pots under greenhouse conditions up to an early post-application stage (1 to 2 leaves). A standard soil is used as cultivation substrate. At a post-emergence stage, the herbicides are applied to the test plants either alone or in admixture with safeners as a tank mixture. The rates of application are governed by the optimum concentrations determined under field or greenhouse conditions. The tests are evaluated after 1 or 2 weeks (100% action = plant completely dead; 0% action =: no phytotoxic action). The mixtures used in this test exhibit good results.<br>
Examples of the good safening action of prometryn on the compound of formula la (N-[3-(2-trifluoroethoxy)-pyridin-2-yl-sulfonyl]-N'-(4,6-dimethoxy-pyrimidin-2-yl)-urea sodium salt in the form of the J modification) are given in Table 1 below:<br>
Crop plant:	cotton<br>
Weed:	IPOHE (ivyleaf morningglory)<br>
Table 1: Safening action of prometryn on the compound of formula la:<br><br>
The results in Table 1 show that prometryn, which is known as a herbicide, at a rate of application of 0.56 g/ha is able to bring about a considerable reduction in the phytotoxic<br><br>
action of the compound of formula la on cotton for both the tested rates of application of compound of formula la. At the same time, the herbicidal action of the compound of formula la on the tested weed at a rate of application of 5 g/ha is reduced only very slightly. Prometryn alone exhibits no herbicidal action on cotton at the tested rate of application.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
What is claimed is:<br>
1.	A selectively herbicidal composition which, in addition to comprising customary inert<br>
formulation adjuvants, comprises as active ingredient a mixture of<br>
a)	a herbicidally effective amount of a herbicide of formula I,<br><br>
wherein<br>
M is an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal;<br>
n is 1 or 2;<br>
r and s are each independently of the other 0, ½, 1, 1½, 2, 2½ or 3; and<br>
L is ethyl acetate, acetonitrile, dimethyl sulfoxide, dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide,<br>
N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, acetone, butanone, methylene chloride, trichloromethane, trichloro-<br>
ethane, tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether, 1,2-dimethoxyethane, dioxane, methyl tert-butyl ether,<br>
chlorobenzene, toluene or xylene, and<br>
b)	a herbicide-antagonistically effective amount of a compound of formula II<br><br>
wherein R1 is chlorine, methoxy or methylthio, R2 is ethyl or isopropyl and R3 is ethyl, isopropyl, -C(CN)(CH3)-CH3 or tert-butyl.<br>
2.	A method of selectively controlling weeds and grasses in crops of useful plants, which<br>
comprises treating the useful plants or seeds or cuttings thereof or the area under cultivation<br>
with a herbicidally effective amount of a herbicide of formula I according to claim 1 and a<br>
herbicide-antagonistically effective amount of a compound of formula II according to claim 1.<br><br>
3. A method according to claim 2, wherein the crop of useful plants is cotton, sugar cane and<br>
rice.<br><br>
4.   A selectively herbicidal composition substantially as herein described and exemplified.<br><br></td>
