				<td>Field of invention<br>
The present invention relates to a system for the collection and re-<br>
infusion of blood in to a human body just before surgery. More specifically, it<br>
is a system for the collection of blood from human body (an eligible patient)<br>
just before surgery and re-infusion to the same person. The proposed<br>
invention will be used for collecting blood just before surgery within a short<br>
span of time and anti-coagulating patient's blood for re-infusion in to the same<br>
patient on the operation theater (OT) table prior to the surgery.<br>
Background<br>
Transfusion Medicine is a specialty of medical sciences offering human<br>
health care services. This specialty deals with collecting blood from human<br>
volunteers; testing for various transfusion transmitted infectious markers (like<br>
HIV, hepatitis etc.); separating in to individual blood components and issuing<br>
to needy patients. Blood transfusion services take all precautions to prevent<br>
transfusion transmitted infections from volunteer's blood to the blood of<br>
recipients. However, transfusion of blood always carried a risk of transfusion<br>
transmitted infections. There are other multiple risks of blood transfusion<br>
when blood from individual is transfused to another individual (homologous or<br>
ordinary blood transfusion). These complications are developing antibodies<br>
against transfused blood components (e.g. red cells, white cells, platelets and<br>
plasma proteins); wrong blood transfusion due to misidentification of units;<br>
hemolysis of blood units due to long or unfavorable storage.<br>
To avoid these problems, blood from the same patient is collected just<br>
before the surgery on the OT table and transfused to the same patient during<br>
or after the surgery as per requirement To avoid drawbacks of conventional<br>
blood transfusions, autologous blood transfusion is highly suggested by<br>
Transfusion Medicine text books. Autologous transfusion is defined as the<br>
collection and subsequent reinfusion of patient's own blood or blood ^<br>
component. Blood from the eligible patient is collected (before, during or after<br>
the surgery), stored temporarily and reinfused as needed during or after the<br>
surgery. As own blood is easily accepted by the body, it is an extremely safe<br>
way to help the patient in the recovery process. The body will easily replace<br>
the blood cells and volume of the fluid between each donation.<br>
There are three main types of autologous transfusions:<br>
1. Pre- deposit transfusion<br>
2. Normo volumic hemodilution transfusion<br>
3. Cell salvage transfusion<br>
1. Pre- deposit autologous transfusion.<br>
When the patient donates 2 or more units of blood within 3- 10 days<br>
before planned surgery in a normal single blood bag is called pre- deposit<br>
autologous donation. These bags are transfused to the same patient during<br>
or after the surgery.<br>
2. Normo volumic hemodilution transfusion<br>
In this case, 2 or more units of autologous blood are collected from the<br>
patient on the OT table just before the surgery and the same volume is<br>
replaced with normal saline. In absence of customized hemodilution bags, this<br>
procedure is done by using ordinary single blood bag. The main idea of this<br>
normo volumic hemodilution is that whatever blood is lost by the patient<br>
(during surgery) is diluted blood. Whenever the patient requires blood<br>
transfusion, already collected autologous fresh blood is transfused back to<br>
patient with fresh platelets and coagulation factors. That is why this process is<br>
called hemodilution. Use of patient's own blood that was withdrawn just before<br>
the surgery to replace the blood lost during surgery has been found to provide<br>
better perfusion and reduced blood loss due to the dilution of patient's blood.<br>
3. Cell salvage transfusion<br>
When there is a bleeding inside the body and blood is collected in the<br>
body cavity like abdomen or thorax, then the collected blood is aspirated out<br>
with an artificial pump. Then the shaded blood is washed or filtered and<br>
transfused back to the same patient<br>
Hemodilution technique is earned out in the OT by the anesthetists<br>
and or by the surgeons which is theoretically and technically different entity<br>
than other two procedures. Depending upon the disease condition and<br>
hemoglobin status of the patient doctors decide for hemodilution procedure<br>
on the spot. They collect blood from the patient just before the surgery<br>
(volume replaced with normal saline) and keep in the operation theatre for<br>
transfusion during or just after surgery. The main idea of this process is that if<br>
the patient bleeds during surgery, he / she will loose diluted blood and<br>
patient's own pre-collected units will be transfused when required. This<br>
process is simple and does not require any instrument However, it is usually<br>
not practiced due to absence of customized hemodilution bags.<br>
Advantages of hemodilution: There is no risk of any transfusion<br>
transmitted infectious markers. The advantages of the Hemodilution baas are<br>
in contrast with donor blood; patient's blood is instantly available and requires<br>
no cross matching. There is no risk of incompatible blood transfusion. There is<br>
no risk of transmission of diseases like HIV, hepatitis (B &amp; C), Syphilis etc.<br>
Surgeons/ anaesthetist do not need to depend on blood bank supply<br>
especially in case of rare blood groups and blood shortage situations. This<br>
procedure saves money and time of relatives of patients. There is also no<br>
problem related to transportation of blood from blood banks. In a country like<br>
India, patient's relatives would not be forced to donate as replacement blood<br>
donors. Hemodilution helps to lower hemoglobin during surgery which leads<br>
to drop in red cell number directly lowering blood viscosity, decreasing<br>
peripheral resistance and increasing cardiac output<br>
Though hemodilution procedure is highly recommended for safe blood<br>
transfusion, it is hardly practiced by surgeons and anesthetists due to<br>
absence of any suitable collection apparatus. In absence of any specialized<br>
hemodilution bag, clinicians are forced to use ordinary single blood donation<br>
bags containing CPDA1 solution which is a preservative solution for long term<br>
blood storage. For the collection of every unit of blood from patient, clinicians<br>
have to prick veins for every unit they collect which leads to problem in finding<br>
veins every time. Moreover, blood collected in CPDA1 infuses extra chemical/<br>
preservative unnecessarily to patients.<br>
Prior Arts<br>
In the prior arts, many techniques are known for the collection and re-<br>
infusion of blood just before the surgery. One of such technique is US 2004/<br>
0102728 which describes an apparatus for collecting blood from a patient,<br>
comprising a collection vessel having a pleated, compressible body, the<br>
vessel having an inlet port adapted to be connected to a patient line for<br>
drawing blood from a patient; at least one, outlet port adapted to be<br>
connected to a blood collection bag. In this patent a filter, catheter, pump like<br>
structure to pump out shredded blood from the abdomen/ chest etc. are<br>
enclosed. Also in this patent bag needs to be primed with blood from the<br>
hand pump. In this prior art, the bag can be kept only for 6 hrs because it is an<br>
open system. This patent daim is related to cell selvage transfusion which is<br>
completely different in terms of structure and process described in the present<br>
claim.<br>
In other known technique, US 2006/0142707: a system and method<br>
for autologous normovolemic hemodilution (ANH) is disclosed. The system<br>
can include a vacuum canister, which is sized to accept donor bags of a<br>
predetermined capacity. The vacuum canister is connected to a vacuum<br>
source which applies suction to the donor bag within the canister. The system<br>
can include a canister having a self-generated vacuum, which includes<br>
compressible sidewalls that are spring-loaded to provide negative pressure<br>
needed to collect blood from a patient without the use of a gravity-induced<br>
siphon gradient. Also disclosed are ANH systems and kits that rely on a<br>
gravity-induced siphon gradient for blood collection.<br>
The distinguishing features of the invention with the prior art are as<br>
follows.<br>
1. Blood is collected from arterial line but in the present invention, blood is<br>
collected from venous line. Venous blood collection has less<br>
complication than arterial blood collection.<br>
2. Blood flow is connected to canisters with a stop cock like valve. But in<br>
the present invention, it is collected by gravity gradient<br>
3. In the US patent there is artificial pressure to collect blood which may<br>
lead to rupturing of red cells, but in the present invention, there is no<br>
rupturing of blood cells since the blood is collected by the gravitational<br>
force. There is no chance of blood damage due to artificial pressure.<br>
4. There is a T shaped connection whereas present invention bag has<br>
'Y' connection which provides the collection of blood in to multiple<br>
bags.<br>
5. There is a rotating canister in the prior art but there is no such<br>
attachment in the invention of the applicant<br>
6. In US patent no anticoagulant is specified whereas in the present<br>
invention blood bag, acid citrate dextrose (ACD) is used as<br>
anticoagulant. The prior art mentioned that bags will be "filled with<br>
anticoagulants'. All blood transfusion anticoagulants are liquid and<br>
measured in ml. Without liquid anticoagulants, blood will clot Or, if dry<br>
anticoagulant like EDTA is used, blood transfusion will be toxic for<br>
transfusion. In the invention of the applicant only anticoagulant (ACD)<br>
was used but no preservatives are used.<br>
7. In the US patent, -22 mmHg negative pressures by canister had been<br>
applied and blood collected from an artery. Arterial pressure is usually<br>
140 mm of Hg and cumulative pressure on collected blood will be<br>
about 162 (140 + 22) mm of Hg which may damage cells collected<br>
inside the bag.<br>
8. This patent claim is completely different in terms of structure and<br>
process described in the present claim.<br>
In another method US 2004/0243105 the invention provides an apparatus<br>
and method to allow for the drainage of blood from the site of the wound into a<br>
blood collection device. The blood collection device is held at a vacuum as is<br>
retained within a vacuum storage chamber which is in turn conjoined to a<br>
further primary vacuum reservoir by a valve. The valve serves to control and<br>
regulate the vacuum levels between the primary vacuum reservoir and<br>
secondary chamber in which the blood collection device is contained.<br>
Following drainage of blood into the blood collection device, the flexible walls<br>
of the blood collection device allow for the optional re-transfusion of blood<br>
back into the patient from whom it was drained. This patent claim is related to<br>
cell selvage transfusion which is completely different in terms of structure and<br>
process described in the present claim.<br>
In yet another method US 4006745 , an autologous blood transfusion<br>
system comprising at least two interconnected blood receptacles, the first of<br>
which is evacuated and connected to a suction device for aspirating blood.<br>
The second receptacle takes blood from the first by overcoming the vacuum<br>
in the first with a greater vacuum in the second without interrupting the ability<br>
of the suction device to simultaneously aspirate blood. The second receptacle<br>
comprised a transfer bag for re-infusion into the patient or an infusion set<br>
connected to the second receptacle to permit simultaneous collection of the<br>
blood from the patient and infusion of the blood back into the patient In either<br>
case, the second receptacle is selectively exposed to positive pressure to<br>
expel the blood from the second receptacle into the transfer bag or patient<br>
The method includes aspirating blood from the patient and collecting blood in<br>
the first receptacle. Blood is thereafter transferred to the second receptacle by<br>
increasing the vacuum in the second receptacle over the first receptacle<br>
without interrupting the ability of the suction device to simultaneously aspirate<br>
blood. Blood is then expelled from the second receptacle by subjecting the<br>
blood within the second receptacle to positive fluid pressure. This patent claim<br>
is related to cell selvage transfusion which is completely different in terms of<br>
structure and process described in the present claim.<br>
In JP 8052197, it is stated that, to provide a set of blood bags,<br>
which prevents white corpuscles from being mixed in concentrated red<br>
corpuscle liquid in a parent bag for collecting blood by connecting bags<br>
filled with red corpuscle preserved liquid to the parent bag for collecting<br>
blood using a connecting tube. In a set 1 of blood bags, first child bag 8 and<br>
a second child bag 6 is connected to a parent bag 4 for collecting blood,<br>
which is used to collect whole blood through a blood collecting needle 2 and<br>
a blood collecting tube 3. The child bag 6 and 8 are divided by a branched<br>
tube 7. A bag 10 including red corpuscle preserved liquid is connected to<br>
the parent bag 4 for collecting tube 11. Each of a connecting tube 5 and 1 is<br>
provided with a stopper, called a bent bar, which is bent near the parent bag<br>
4 for collecting blood to pass through. When reserved red corpuscle liquid is<br>
transferred in to the parent bag 4 for collecting blood, the set 1 of the blood<br>
bag is allowed to communicate with the child bag 6 and 8 by setting the<br>
connecting tube 11 not to pass through the connecting tube 5 polluted by<br>
buffycoat. There fore, white corpuscles are not mixed. This patent claim is<br>
related to auto transfusion in children which is completely different in terms<br>
of structure and process described in the present claim.<br>
The inventor of the present invention has invented the present<br>
hemodilution bag which is easier to operate. It is a one step method for the<br>
collection and re- infusion of blood with a single phlebotomy with acid-<br>
citrate-dextrose (ACD) as FDA (Food &amp; Drug Administration) approved<br>
anticoagulant. Here in the present invention, blood collected is fresh and so<br>
there is no need to use any filter. This hemodilution bag is for adult patients.<br>
Moreover the blood is collected from the venous line which has no<br>
complexity. The tube of the bag is sufficiently long (170 cm) so that blood<br>
can be collected when patient is lying on an OT table. It can be kept for a<br>
maximum of 21 days if required, without any preservatives. Both bags are<br>
collected just before the surgery and not during or after the surgery. In the<br>
hemodilution bag, the blood is collected from the vein or from the central line<br>
of the patient. Hence the present invention is entirely different from the all<br>
prior arts.<br>
Summary of the invention.<br>
The present invention relates to a system for the collection and re-<br>
infusion of blood to human body just before surgery.<br>
The present invention comprises of a novel system and method for the<br>
collection of patient's blood just before surgery and collected volume of blood<br>
is replaced by normal saline infusion before surgery and there after reinforcing<br>
the same blood to the same patient during or after surgery.<br>
The bag used for the present invention is made of PVC plastic (medical<br>
grade). There is one 16 gauze needle covered with needle safety shield on<br>
the tip of the apparatus to collect blood either from the arm of the patient or<br>
from the central line attached to the surgical patient From the needle there<br>
are about 170 cm long single tube segments and after that there is a 'Y'<br>
connector with two bag attachments. There are either two 350 ml bags or two<br>
450ml bags as per requirement of clinicians. This connection will be increased<br>
to four such 350 or 450 ml bags as per requirement of clinicians. The length of<br>
the tubing from the connector to the bag is 170 cm or more. There will be one<br>
roller cum stripper clamps on both tubes after the plastic clamp near to the Y<br>
connector. This attachment is to strip down dead volume blood in the tubing<br>
and also to regulate flow of blood in both bags. There will be five plastic<br>
clamps in the invention, one will be in between the needle butt and Y<br>
connection, one each will be on the proximal part and one each on distal part<br>
of both roller and striper.<br>
The hemodilution transfusion bag is designed with two plastic bags and<br>
two long single tube segments are attached to the Y connector on the bag.<br>
Roller cium stripper damp is attached to each tube near to the Y connector.<br>
Then both the tubes are connected to the centre of the two separate bags as<br>
shown in the figure 1.<br>
Both bags contain only Acid Citrate Dextrose (ACD) solution as the<br>
anticoagulant and there are no preservatives like manitol, phosphate or<br>
adenine in the bag. The anticoagulant ratio will be kept at 15 ml of ACD for<br>
every 100 ml of blood collected. It will prevent the unnecessary infusion of<br>
patients with preservatives. The length of the collection tube will be<br>
approximately 170 cm which is sufficiently long to collect blood from patients<br>
arm or central infusion line when the patient is lying on the OT table.<br>
A rotary shaker for mixing the solution with the blood is provided for<br>
frequent mixing, there by preventing coagulation and saving precious OT<br>
time. It will also ensure accurate volume collection. However, if any clinician<br>
does not want to invest in buying rotary shaker, they can adopt alternate<br>
method. Two plastic hooks are provided on each blood bag to hang the bags<br>
upside down during collection so that the collected blood passes through the<br>
anticoagulant solution and it is automatically mixed with the solution. There<br>
will be printed scale on the back side of both bags (side- b). The amount of<br>
blood collected can be measured in relation to volume collected with the help<br>
of printed scale.<br>
Once the patient is shifted to the OT table, one of the good peripheral<br>
veins will be selected by the anesthetists/ surgeon for phlebotomy. The bag<br>
will be taken out of the sterile pouches and name and hospital identification<br>
number of the patient will be written in the green labels of the both blood bags<br>
to avoid misidentification as per international standard (side-a). Two loose<br>
knots are placed 5 cm above each bags near C-3 clamps. Once vein is<br>
selected and skin preparation is completed for aseptic blood collection (or<br>
central line is decided), venipuncture (or connected to central line) is done<br>
and blood starts coming to both bags by gravity one after another using<br>
clamps (C-2). When collection in the first bag is completed, respective C-2<br>
clamp of the closed, remaining blood in long tube is stripped down towards<br>
the main bag, damp (C-3) is applied, and loose knot is tied down. The tube<br>
between the tied knot and the clamp is cut bag is separated and first<br>
hemodilution bag is ready. Once C-2 on one side is closed, simultaneously,<br>
other side C-2 is opened so that blood started coming to the second bag.<br>
When second bag is filled up, first clamp (C-1) is closed, needle (coupler) is<br>
taken out from the vein or central line and needle guard is applied to prevent<br>
needle stick injury. The same process is repeated like, the other side and<br>
second hemodilution bag is separated from tubing. If clinician has requirement<br>
for collection of more than two units in a single go, similar bags with 4<br>
attachments with single needle can be developed.<br>
A novel plastic roller cum stripper has been attached on both sides of<br>
long tubing.<br>
Objectives<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a hemodilution<br>
transfusion bag system for collecting blood without applying external force.<br>
Hemodilution is one of the best and safest systems of blood transfusion;<br>
however, there is no hemodilution bag available which collects venous blood<br>
by natural force without applying mechanical force (which may damage blood<br>
content inside the bag/ canister). Due to absence of specialized bag,<br>
surgeons and anesthesiologists cannot practice hemodilution procedure in a<br>
scientific manner thus exposing eligible patients to the risks of transfusion<br>
related complications.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to collect blood from the<br>
peripheral vein or central line with the help of gravity and also because of<br>
positive pressure in the vein of the patient with the help of a special process.<br>
Further object of the present invention is to provide a hemodilution bag<br>
working on the gravitational force so that the damage caused to the blood<br>
cells due to the creation of the pressure either by hand pump/ mechanical<br>
pump or by any external pressure can be eliminated.<br>
Further object of the present invention is to provide each filled<br>
hemodilution blood bag within 7 to 10 minutes. In order to avoid the clotting, it<br>
can be mixed by using blood bag shaker or by hanging upside down from OT<br>
table with hooks and using a scale on the back of the bag (side-b).<br>
Further object of the present invention is to prepare the blood collected<br>
bag just before (10-30 minutes) the surgery using the hemodilution bag for<br>
the same patient<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a hemodilution<br>
bag with liquid anticoagulants but without any preservative which can be kept<br>
for a maximum of 21 days since it is a closed system, thus preventing infusion<br>
of unwanted red cell preservatives (chemicals).<br>
Further object of the present invention is to provide a hemodilution bag<br>
which can be collected just before the surgery, not during or after the surgery.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide an industrially<br>
viable and convenient (simple to use) hemodilution transfusion bag even in<br>
small hospitals without any complicated procedure.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide extremely safe<br>
transfusion bags which easily replace the blood cells and volume of fluid<br>
between each donation.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a closed<br>
transfusion bag system (either of 350 ml and or 450 ml) which is filled with<br>
ACD Solution (15 ml of ACD for 100 ml of blood) which has a shelf life of 21<br>
days.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a transfusion<br>
bag which does not have a problem of back flow.<br>
Another object of the present invention is that the anesthetist / surgeon<br>
can take the spot decisions on the table for autologous transfusion and there<br>
is no dependency on the blood banks for cross- match test. It saves time,<br>
availability of blood at blood banks and transportation problems. Moreover, it<br>
does not require extra man power and extra cost It prevents adverse<br>
transfusion reactions.<br>
Brief description with drawings.<br>
Figure 1 shows the hemodilution transfusion bag.<br>
Detailed Description<br>
The present invention comprises of a novel system and method for the<br>
collection of patients blood just before surgery and before he starts bleeding<br>
and there after transfusing the same blood to the same patient whenever<br>
required during or after surgery.<br>
The present invention (figure: 1) comprises of two blood bags (J-1 &amp; J-<br>
2) which are made of medical grade PVC plastic. These are made of 350 ml<br>
or 450 ml capacity as per requirement of clinicians. There is a green coloured<br>
label on one side of the bag (side-a of both bags) which carry manufacturer's<br>
information, name of the patient and the hospital number of the patient for<br>
identification (G-1 &amp;G-2). On the other side of the bag (side-b of both), there is<br>
a scale which will show amount of blood collected in the bag (1-1 &amp; I-2). Both<br>
labels and scales are placed upside down so that users in the OT room can<br>
read them correctly. One plastic hook (H-1 &amp; H-2) is placed in the bottom of<br>
each bag so that each bag can be hanged upside down for collection. Both<br>
the bag contain Add Citrate Dextrose ( ACD) solution as anticoagulant only<br>
and there is no adenine, phosphate or manitol preservative because these<br>
bags are not going to be used for RBC preservation. It will prevent<br>
unnecessary infusion of patients with preservatives.<br>
Two single tube segments (F-1 &amp; F-2) having about 150cm length are<br>
connected to the T connector (D) of the blood bags (2 cm) as shown in the<br>
figure 1. Two loose knots will be applied by the user 5 cm above the blood<br>
bag before starting blood collection. There are two plastic clamps (C-3) on<br>
both sides which will be just near the knot (away from the bag).<br>
There is one roller cum stripper clamp on each side (E-1 &amp; E-2)<br>
attached to each tubes at the distal end of the tube. It is made of two rolling<br>
plastic wheels inside a plastic frame. Both wheels can be pressed by two<br>
fingers and rolling wheels will squeeze down remaining blood in the dead<br>
volume of the tubing towards the blood bag. This is a part of the novel<br>
invention. The inner diameter of the tubing is approximately 2.8 mm and<br>
external diameter is about 5 mm. There are two plastic damps (C-2) on both<br>
side in between the Y connection and roller cum strippers. The function of<br>
these two clamps is to regulate flow on both sides of bags and also to remain<br>
close during stripping of dead volume of blood.<br>
Then both the single tubes are connected to a plastic " Y " connector<br>
(D) having 2 cm length and the same is connected to a piece of tubing<br>
having a length of 20 cm. Then the tubing is connected to plastic needle butt<br>
to which one 16 gauze needle (A) is connected. There is a needle guard (8)<br>
just before the needle butt which can slide up and down. The function of this<br>
is to protect the operator from needle stick injury after blood collection. There<br>
is another damp (C-1) in between Y connector and the needle guard. The<br>
function of the damp is to dose blood connection at the end of the procedure<br>
before putting needle guard into position.<br>
A green colour blood bag label (G) for the patient identification is<br>
attached to each blood bag as shown in the figure-1 (side 'a' and 'b' of both<br>
bags). Both labels are placed upside down so that OT staff can read<br>
identification details during collection and transfusing back to the patient. One<br>
slit is provided on each bag on the proximal end for hanging the bag as shown<br>
in the figure. One plastic hook (H-1 &amp; 2) is provided on each bag as shown in<br>
the figure for hanging the blood bag upside down during the collection so that<br>
the collected blood passes through the anticoagulant solution. There is a<br>
needle guard of about 8 cm (B) which will be slipped forward to cover the tip<br>
of the needle (A) to avoid needle stick injury to OT staff after taking the needle<br>
out of vein/ central line. There will be 5 plastic damps (C-1, C-2 &amp; C-3). One<br>
will be below the needle guard towards the Y connection (C-1), one each will<br>
be distal (C-2) and another one each (C-3) proximal to the roller and strippers<br>
on both sides.<br>
With the use of the blood bag shaker and weight monitor for mixing the<br>
blood with the solution, it is automatically mixed with solution and actual<br>
amount of desired quantity can be collected. When rotary shakers are used,<br>
clinicians can save their time by avoiding frequent mixing and saving their<br>
precious OT time. If they do not want to use expensive rotary shakers, the can<br>
use the scale on the back side (side-b) of the bag of measuring amount of<br>
blood collection.<br>
The procedure for the collection of the blood in the hemodilution blood baa is:<br>
1. Take out the blood bag from the sterile sealed cover and write down<br>
the name, hospital No (and blood group, if available) of the patient in<br>
the green labels attached to the blood bags for the identification.<br>
2. Put one loose knot each from 5cm above each hemodilution bags and<br>
below the plastic damp. There is one hook on each bag and both the<br>
bags are hanged upside down to any attachment of the OT table below<br>
the body level of the patient. Break open the needle cover and does a<br>
phlebotomy in any of the major veins of the patient. It may be replaced<br>
by a coupler which can be connected to a central line of the patient.<br>
3. Two roller cum stripper clamps are provided in the tubing. In between<br>
this attachment and Y connector, there are two clamps. One clamp will<br>
be closed and another one will be open to facilitate blood flow to the<br>
bags one after another. Once needle is connected to the vein (or<br>
central line), blood will start coming to one bag. Since both the bags<br>
are kept upside down, blood will enter from the patient to the<br>
hemodilution bag through the ACD anticoagulant which will<br>
automatically anticoagulate autologous blood. These bags will be<br>
supplied with commercially available blood bag shaker and weight<br>
monitor which will help constant mixing of blood and also to collect<br>
exact amount of blood.<br>
4. Once the first bag is full, the clamp will be applied near the roller cum<br>
stripper to stop blood collection in the first bag. The clamp on the other<br>
side will be opened and blood will start collecting in the second bag.<br>
5. White second bag is in the process of filling up, remaining blood in the<br>
tube of the first bag will be stripped down up to 5 cm top of the bag and<br>
the damp near the knot will be closed. Then the pressure on the roller<br>
will be released and the loose knot will be tied. It will prevent backflow<br>
of blood from the bag to the tubing again. The process will prevent<br>
wastage of about 50 ml of autologous blood of the patient on each side<br>
of the tube. The first bag tubing is cut between the knot and the clamp.<br>
6. When the second bag is full, one clamp is closed which is placed<br>
between the roller and Y connection and another clamp is also dosed<br>
between Y connector and the needle guard. The needle (or the<br>
coupler) is taken out of the vein (or central line) and needle guard is<br>
applied to prevent needle stick injury.<br>
7. The same procedure is repeated for the second bag when it is full as<br>
mentioned in step no: 5.<br>
8. Both autologous blood bags are ready to use and shifted to the tables<br>
in the OT room. They will be kept on a flat surface at airconditioned<br>
temperature (22-24° C) for 6 hours. If required, both units can be<br>
transfused like banked blood in the OT or in the ward anytime between<br>
0 hours to 21 days after collection. Before transfusion, it is mandatory to<br>
cross-check identity of bags with the patient.<br>
9. If transfused after 6 hours, it is recommended to store in a regulated<br>
and monitored temperature of 2-8° C.<br>
10. All needle, needle guard and extra tubing shall be discarded as per<br>
norms of btohazard materials.<br>
