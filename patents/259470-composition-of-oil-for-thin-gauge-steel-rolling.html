"COMPOSITION OF OIL FOR THIN GAUGE STEEL ROLLING"<br>
INDIAN OIL CORPORATION LIMITED of the address: G-9, Ali Yavar Jung Marg, Bandra (East), Mumbai-400051, India.<br>
The following specification  particularly describes  and  ascertains the nature of this invention and the manner in which it has to be performed:<br><br>
Field of Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a steel cold rolling oil composition comprising of natural fats / oils, synthetic ester, fatty acid, antioxidant, extreme pressure, antiwear, antifoam, emulsifiers and high viscosity index mineral oil. The composition described in present invention relates to the composition of an oil, which forms metastable milky emulsion with water and is quite useful for steel cold rolling and particularly thin gauge rolling in 4-Hi and 6-Hi rolling mills.<br>
Prior Art<br>
Rolling oil prepared by adding emulsifier and dispersing agents to the mixtures obtained by adding oiliness improvers, extreme pressure and antiwear additives, antioxidants, antifoam, animal fat or vegetable fat such as tallow, palm, coconut, various synthetic ester and base mineral oil or the mixture of oils thereof. In rolling, a liquid obtained by emulsifying and dispersing rolling oil in a suitable concentration (coolant liquid) by means of mechanical agitation in a tank is sprayed on work rolls for cooling and lubrication at roll bite. The coolant liquid is circulated continuously to remove the iron fines and debris generated during rolling operation.<br>
Formulation of the rolling oil depends on the customer requirement and is mill specific. The plant may be slow, medium or high speed. Depending upon the mill speed, load, quality of water, stirring rate of the coolant, the formulation of the rolling oil also changed to a great extent. The formulation variation observed in terms of saponification value/fat and synthetic ester content, extreme pressure additives, quantity and quality of emulsifier, antifoam etc. The lubrication requirement also changes from mill to mill.<br>
2<br><br>
The lubricity and surface cleanliness property seems to be the most important characteristics of a cold rolling oil formulation. The lubrication property of cold rolling oil can be assesses by measurement of the load carrying ability of the oil and low friction coefficient. The lubricity property of a cold rolling oil formulation is dependent probably on two parameters e.g. the lubricating additives selected and the metastability of the emulsion. The lubrication property is also dependent on the plate out characteristics of the cold rolling oil. The plate out characteristics basically an adhesion_property of the cold rolling oil to the metal surface. The metastability and plate out characteristics is highly correlated and a linear correlation exists between them. But they are measured in different scale. A less amount of plate-out / metastability brings about insufficient lubrication. Although plate out /metastability are the desirable properties, the extreme value of these properties are also not desired as these leads to the unstable emulsion as well as high oil consumption during rolling. So an optimum quantity of plate out / metastability is required for a good cold rolling oil. In this patent we have measured the metastability as it is better to define and also a measurement of hard water tolerance of rolling oil. The cold rolling oil is generally used as an emulsion where a certain quantity of cold rolling oil is added to the water. Now the quality and hardness of the water changes from customer to customer. Thus the stability and hard water tolerance of the cold rolling oil emulsion is also another criteria. The emulsion (coolant) must not be unstable in hard water. The cold rolling oil emulsion may be a tight emulsion without much oil separation. This is not a desirable characteristic for lubrication. Actually a cold rolling oil emulsion required a "metastable" emulsion (loose emulsion with to some extent oil separation characteristics). The metastable emulsion separates oil to some extent at the roll bite and the separated oil takes care of the lubrication property and just after the rolling operation the oil and water mix together to form the emulsion again    which is possible as the separated oil also contains emulsifiers. Thus the<br>
3<br><br>
measurement of emulsion stability for hard water tolerance and metastability is an important criterion for rolling oil emulsion.<br>
The surface cleanliness of the rolled sheet before and after rolling is another important criterion for good cold rolling oil. In actual customer site, the surface cleanliness property and iron pick up mark of cold rolling oil is assessed by visual observation and tape test. The burn off characteristics is the laboratory measured property which correlates with the good surface cleanliness property of the rolled sheet. The burn off characteristics can be assessed by the Thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA). Trace to very low residue is considered to be cold rolling oil with excellent burn off characteristics. In addition to the lubrication and load carrying capacity, excellent burn off characteristics of cold rolling oil is considered to be one of the basic requirements. This signifies good surface cleanliness properties after annealing of the cold rolling process.<br>

Whereas numerous cold rolling oil lubricants based on different additive system have been developed, there is a continuing need for new products. This is particularly so where the new products present economic advantages and/or performance advantages. Performance advantages can include greater latitude in the ability to effectively formulate the lubricant. It can also include improvement in one or more of the properties of the lubricant. It is particularly effective if these improvements are achieved without adversely affecting the other essential properties of the lubricant.<br>
Several disadvantages are associated and recognized with the known compositions based on the above patents. The formulations are based on either the advantage of emulsifier systems or on the advantages of one or few additives separately.   One<br>
6<br><br>
such disadvantage is that the formulations are based on part of the total additives of cold rolling oil formulation. Yet another disadvantage is that the formulations do not possess superior lubrication properties on the overall additive system. Further burn off characteristics of the cold rolling oil composition also not covered on the overall composition based on emulsifiers and additive system. Still further, the composition does not cover both the lubrication as well as surface cleanliness property on the overall formulations. Still further the formulations do not describe property the entire practical range of the diluted version of the cold rolling oil lubricant formulation containing the above advantage of superior lubrication as well as surface cleanliness property. Further none of the diluted lubricant formulation describes the metastability characteristics of the coolant (emulsion). Further disadvantages of the formulations are that the none of the formulations are available which shows good lubrication property, burn off characteristics and metastability. Another disadvantage in the above patents is the hard water compatibility of the diluted cold rolling oil formulation.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to the development of a composition of oil suitable for thin gauge steel rolling.<br>
In this era of rapidly increasing lubricant costs and the ever present possibility of critical shortages, it is mandatory that users obtain maximum utilization of each lubricant. Cold rolling oil for steel is a prime example which is being used in significant volumes by steel mills. Its performance is critical to the proper rolling of steel, maintaining good shape of steel sheet and high strip surface cleanliness. The oil residue left on the steel sheet after rolling is converted into black powdery material during annealing treatment and it poses difficulties in next operations like<br>
7<br><br>
coating, painting, etc. Now-a-days steel industry demands rolling oils that leave no or minimal residue after annealing treatment to produce mirror finish steel strip and boost the brand image of their products.<br>
In the rolling process, the thickness of the strip is reduced by the action of stretching from side and loading in normal direction. The coefficient of friction existing in the zone of contact between the roll and strip has a pronounced effect on the roll separating force required to achieve a given reduction in thickness. The theoretical relationship between these forces and the coefficient of friction is complex and based on many assumptions. However, it is reported that the lower coefficient of friction, the lower the rolling load and the greater the reduction that can be taken. There is also a minimum level below which friction must not be reduced or the grip required to keep the strip moving through the roll bite will be lost, producing skidding. The rolling oil performs the functions of reducing the coefficient of friction at roll bite and cooling of work roll / strip to avoid heat marks.<br>
Formulations of rolling oils are quite complex. The performance or nonperformance of rolling oil becomes quickly evident during its use in rolling mills. The performance of water-soluble rolling oils is dependent on the water quality and handling practices adopted at the mill site also. A defect in the rolling oil formulation will unveil in a couple of days if not earlier and will require corrective action. The factors affecting the performance of rolling oils are multi-faceted and require special attentions of the formulator as well as user. Performance of the same oil may vary significantly from one use to other depending upon the application, metallurgy and maintenance practices.<br>
8<br><br>
Keeping in view of all the above properties of rolling oil composition, a developmental program was initiated at authors' laboratory. A large number of chemical additives were used in the development of rolling oil composition and described in the present invention. The present invention is a synergistic combination of a set of ingredients to achieve the desired out put. Whereas, all prior art compositions were based on the concentrations of one/ two ingredients of the total composition and their benefits. It differentiate the present invention with prior art.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The composition of oil suitable for thin gauge steel sheet rolling disclosed in the present invention is an optimized combination of natural fats / oils, synthetic esters, high viscosity mineral oil and other performance additives such as extreme pressure, antiwear, emulsifiers, antioxidants, antifoam etc.<br>
The oil composition of the present invention forms metastable milky oil-in-water emulsion when mixed with water using proper agitation. The emulsion so formed provides adequate lubricity and cooling during rolling of thin gauge steel sheets. This emulsion also depicts very good hard water compatibility, required for longer useful life The emulsion also exhibited superior burn off characteristics as no coolant patches were observed after annealing treatment of rolled steel coils.<br>
Detailed Description<br>

The base oil and/ fat, ester heated to 45-50 °C with stirring. The cold rolling oil phase was prepared by adding the extreme pressure and / antiwear additives, emulsifiers, antioxidant etc to the base oil or the mixture of base oil, fat and ester one by one under stirring condition. Reasonable time (5-10 minutes for each additive) was given to dissolve one additive before addition of the next additive. The final (after addition of the final additive) rolling oil blend stirred for another 30 minutes with stirring and heating. Ordinary Remi stirrer used for the stirring and dissolving the additives to the base stock. Precaution taken for avoiding excessive heating (&gt; 60 °C) of the oil phase. Thus the cold rolling oil formulation finalized. The water used for making the emulsion was either D.M water with a pH of 6.5-7.5 and hardness 
14<br><br>
addition of cold rolling oil phase of required quantity to the water phase ( 45-50 C) and stirring the emulsion under high shear @ 11000 rpm for 5 minutes with a special homogenizer ( ULTRA TURRAX T-25 basic unit with dispersing tool spindle No : S 25 N-25 F of IKA LABORTECHNIK, GmbH, Staufen). The total emulsion prepared was 100 ml. The condition of the emulsion (oil separation and stability) was checked time to time for 24 hrs keeping the emulsion ( 100 ml in a measuring cylinder with stopper) in a preset 50 °C air oven. The emulsion stability and metastabilty of the emulsion then assessed by the separation of the amount of cream and oil.<br>
The lubrication property of the formulations can be evaluated in terms of friction coefficient and Falex Jaw Load ( Load Carrying Capacity of the rolling Oil). This is carried out as per ASTM D-6425 (friction coefficient) and ASTM- D 3233 ( Falex Jaw Load). The concentrated and diluted emulsions (coolants) were evaluated for the friction coefficient and Falex Jaw Load respectively. The burn off characteristics is evaluated by the thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) in inert gas e.g. Argon atmosphere. The evaluation is carried out by heating the sample from the room temperature to the to the specified temperature. We have selected the final temperature to 550 °C. Then the residue left is measured.<br>
Experimental Description<br>
In order to establish the suitability of the developed oil composition, a number of compositions using various components comprising natural fats / oils, synthetic esters, high viscosity mineral oil and other performance additives such as extreme pressure, antiwear, emulsifiers, antioxidants, antifoam etc. were prepared and evaluated for emulsion stability, hard water compatibility, burn off characteristics, lubricity etc.<br>
15<br><br>
It can be appreciated that only combination of emulsifiers and natural fats / oils is not sufficient for making good quality steel cold rolling oil. Therefore, an optimized combination of emulsifiers and other performance additives was selected based on the chemistry and nature of the emulsifiers to get a composition of rolling oil suitable for thin gauge steel sheet rolling.<br>
The compositions and results of various experiments carried out are compiled as follows:<br>
Example -1<br>
A blend of 40 % wt of coconut oil, 40% wt of palm oil, 10% wt of TMP trioleate, 4.5 %wt of oleic acid, 0. 5 % wt hindered phenol based antioxidant, 1% wt of phosphorous based extreme pressure additive, 3% wt nonionic emulsifier-1 ( HLB value = 11), 1% wt nonionic emulsifier-2 (HLB value = 10).<br>
Example -2<br>
A similar composition of blend-1 where 5% wt of TMP trioleate replaced by 5% wt of base stock where paraffin is the major ingredient.<br>
