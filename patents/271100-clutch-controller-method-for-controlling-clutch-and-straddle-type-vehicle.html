Patent Application No. 2007-043645 filed on February 23,<br>
2007 and Japanese Patent Application No. 2007-231131<br>
filed on September 6, 2007.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a technology for<br>
engaging or disengaging a clutch by an actuator.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
Related semi-automatic vehicles, which actuate an<br>
actuator to engage or disengage a clutch, use a<br>
technology for controlling relative positions of a drive-<br>
side member and a driven-side member of the clutch (the<br>
degree of engagement of the clutch) based on a difference<br>
in rotational speed between these members during engaging<br>
operation of the clutch (for example, JP-A-2001-146930).<br>
The technology is designed to control the degree of<br>
engagement of the clutch based on the difference in<br>
rotational speed between the drive-side member and the<br>
driven-side member. This, however, can prevent<br>
appropriate torque from being constantly transmitted via<br>
1<br><br>
the clutch, and thus can impair riding comfort. For<br>
example, in case where the timing of discontinuing a<br>
half-clutch state is too early, the torque transmitted<br>
from the drive-side member to the driven-side member<br>
sharply increases. This can cause the rider to feel<br>
shocks. An additional technology is also proposed, in<br>
which a half-clutch state is maintained until the<br>
difference in rotational speed is almost zero. However,<br>
this results in excessively low torque being continuously<br>
transmitted to the driven-side member for a long time<br>
period. Thus, the rider can perceive that the vehicle<br>
decelerates excessively.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is made in view of the<br>
foregoing problems, and an object of the invention is to<br>
provide a clutch controller, a method for controlling a<br>
clutch, and a straddle-type vehicle which allow<br>
appropriate torque to be transmitted to the downstream<br>
side via the clutch and which prevent an engine speed<br>
from excessively increasing or decreasing during engaging<br>
operation of the clutch.<br>
In order to solve the foregoing problems, the present<br>
invention is directed to a clutch controller including:<br>
an actuator for changing the degree of engagement between<br>
2<br><br>
a drive-side member and a driven-side member of a clutch,<br>
the members being located downstream of an engine in a<br>
torque transmission path; an actual torque obtaining<br>
section for obtaining torque transmitted from the drive-<br>
side member to a downstream mechanism of the torque<br>
transmission path as actual transmission torque, the<br>
downstream mechanism including the driven-side member; a<br>
request torque obtaining section for obtaining torque<br>
determined based on rider's accelerator operation as<br>
request transmission torque; an engine torque obtaining<br>
section for obtaining torque outputted from the engine as<br>
engine torque; and a control unit for performing a first<br>
control under which the actuator is actuated based on a<br>
difference between the actual transmission torque and the<br>
request transmission torque, such that the actual<br>
transmission torque approximates the request transmission<br>
torque. The control unit determines whether or not the<br>
engine operates in a predetermined operation range, and<br>
depending on the determination result, performs a second<br>
control under which the actuator is actuated such that<br>
the actual transmission torque approximates the engine<br>
torque, in place of the first control.<br>
In addition, the present invention is directed to a<br>
straddle-type vehicle including the clutch controller.<br>
Further, the present invention is directed to a<br>
3<br><br>
method of controlling a clutch including the steps of:<br>
obtaining torque transmitted from a drive-side member of<br>
the clutch to a downstream mechanism of a torque<br>
transmission path as actual transmission torque, the<br>
downstream mechanism including a driven-side member of<br>
the clutch; obtaining torque determined based on rider's<br>
accelerator operation as request transmission torque;<br>
obtaining engine torque outputted from an engine;<br>
performing a first control under which an actuator, which<br>
changes the degree of engagement between the drive-side<br>
member and the driven-side member, is actuated based on a<br>
difference between the actual transmission torque and the<br>
request transmission torque, such that the actual<br>
transmission torque approximates the request transmission<br>
torque; determining whether or not the engine operates in<br>
a predetermined operation range; and performing a second<br>
control under which the actuator is actuated such that<br>
the actual transmission torque approximates the engine<br>
torque, in place of the first control step, depending on<br>
the result from the determination step.<br>
The present invention allows appropriate torque to<br>
be transmitted to the downstream side via the clutch<br>
during engaging operation of the clutch. According to<br>
the present invention, if the engine operates in the<br>
predetermined operation range, the actual transmission<br>
4<br><br>
torque approximates the engine torque. This prevents an<br>
excessive increase or decrease in engine speed. That is,<br>
if the actual transmission torque is higher than the<br>
engine torque, the engine speed decreases, and if the<br>
actual transmission torque is lower than the engine<br>
torque, the engine speed increases. Also, for example,<br>
if the engine operates in an operation range in which the<br>
engine torque increases as the engine speed increases, an<br>
increase or a decrease in engine speed due to a<br>
difference between the actual transmission torque and the<br>
engine torque causes the difference between the actual<br>
transmission torque and the engine torque to be greater,<br>
and therefore, the engine speed further increases or<br>
decreases. According to the present invention, if the<br>
engine operates in the predetermined operation range, the<br>
actuator is actuated such that the actual transmission<br>
torque approximates the engine torque. This prevents<br>
such an excessive increase or decrease in engine speed.<br>
The straddle-type vehicle may be a motorcycle (including<br>
a scooter), a four-wheeled buggy or a snowmobile, for<br>
example.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
An embodiment of the present invention is described<br>
below with reference to the drawings. FIG. 1 is a side<br>
view of a motorcycle 1 provided with a clutch controller<br>
10 as an example of the embodiment of the invention. FIG<br>
2 is a schematic view of a mechanism provided on a torque<br>
transmission path of the motorcycle 1.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1 or FIG. 2, the motorcycle 1 is<br>
provided not only with the clutch controller 10, but also<br>
with an engine 30, a primary deceleration mechanism 36, a<br>
clutch 40, a secondary deceleration mechanism 50, a front<br>
wheel 2, and a rear wheel 3.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, the front wheel 2 is located at<br>
a front part of a vehicle body, and supported by a lower<br>
end of a front fork 4. Handlebars 5 are connected to the<br>
top of the front fork 4. An acceleration grip 5a to be<br>
gripped by a rider is mounted to the right end of the<br>
handlebars 5. The acceleration grip 5a is connected to a<br>
8<br><br>
throttle valve 37a provided in a throttle body 37 (see<br>
FIG. 2). The throttle valve 37a is opened according to<br>
rider's accelerator operation, and a certain amount of<br>
air, which depends on the opening of the throttle valve<br>
37a, is delivered to the engine 30. The motorcycle 1 may<br>
be provided with an electronically-controlled throttle<br>
device. In this case, a sensor for detecting the rider's<br>
accelerator operation and an actuator for opening the<br>
throttle valve 37a according to the accelerator operation<br>
detected by the sensor are provided.<br>
As shown in FIG. 2, the engine 30 has a cylinder 31,<br>
a piston 32, an intake port 33, and a crankshaft 34. The<br>
throttle body 37 is connected to the intake port 33 via<br>
an intake pipe 35.<br>
The throttle valve 37a is placed in an intake<br>
passage of the throttle body 37. Mixture of air, which<br>
flows through the intake passage of the throttle body 37,<br>
and fuel, which is supplied from a fuel supplier (not<br>
shown, for example, injector or carburetor), is delivered<br>
to an interior of the cylinder 31. An ignition plug (not<br>
shown) faces the interior of the cylinder 31 and ignites<br>
the air-fuel mixture within the cylinder 31. Burning the<br>
air-fuel mixture causes the piston 32 to reciprocate<br>
within the cylinder 31. The reciprocating motion of the<br>
piston 32 is converted into rotating motion by the<br>
9<br><br>
crankshaft 34, thereby outputting torque from the engine<br>
30.<br>
The primary deceleration mechanism 36 includes: a<br>
drive-side primary deceleration gear 36a, which operates<br>
in conjunction with the crankshaft 34; and a driven-side<br>
primary deceleration gear 36b, which meshes with the<br>
primary deceleration gear 36a. The primary deceleration<br>
mechanism 36 decelerates the rotation of the crankshaft<br>
34 according to a gear ratio between these gears.<br>
The clutch 40 transmits and shuts off torque output<br>
from the engine 30 to the downstream side of the torque<br>
transmission path. The clutch 40 is a friction clutch,<br>
for example, and is provided with a drive-side member 41<br>
and a driven-side member 42. The drive-side member 41<br>
includes a friction disk, for example, and rotates<br>
together with the primary deceleration gear 36b. The<br>
driven-side member 42 includes a clutch disk, for example,<br>
and rotates together with a main shaft 52. The drive-<br>
side member 41 and the driven-side member 42 are pressed<br>
against each other by elastic force of a clutch spring 44<br>
at the time of engaging the clutch 40, so that the torque<br>
of the engine 30 is transmitted from the drive-side<br>
member 41 to the driven-side member 42. In turn, at the<br>
time of disengaging the clutch 4 0, the driven-side member<br>
42 is moved away from the drive-side member 41, so that<br>
10<br><br>
torque transmission from the drive-side member 41 is<br>
interrupted. The clutch controller 10 is provided with a<br>
clutch actuator 14 as will be discussed later. The<br>
clutch actuator 14 performs engaging operation of the<br>
clutch 40 (switching from the disengaged state to the<br>
engaged state) and disengaging operation thereof<br>
(switching from the engaged state to the disengaged<br>
state) .<br>
The secondary deceleration mechanism 50 is designed<br>
to decelerate the rotation of the main shaft 52 and<br>
transmit the decelerated rotation to an axle 3a of the<br>
rear wheel 3. The secondary deceleration mechanism 50 is<br>
provided with a gearbox 51 and a transmission mechanism<br>
57. The gearbox 51 is a mechanism to change deceleration<br>
ratios, such as a constant-mesh gearbox and a selective-<br>
sliding gearbox.<br>
The gearbox 51 has on the main shaft 52 plural<br>
shift gears 53a (for example, first-speed gear, second-<br>
speed gear, third/fourth-speed gear) and shift gears 53b<br>
(for example, fifth-speed gear and six-speed gear). Also,<br>
the gearbox 51 has on the countershaft 55 plural shift<br>
gears 54a (for example, first-speed gear, second-speed<br>
gear, third/fourth-speed gear) and shift gears 54b (for<br>
example, fifth-speed gear and six-speed gear). The shift<br>
gears 53a are spline-connected to the main shaft 52 and<br>
11<br><br>
operates in conjunction with the main shaft 52. The<br>
shift gears 54a are provided such that they run idle to<br>
the countershaft 55, and mesh with the shift gears 53a,<br>
respectively. The shift gears 53b are provided such that<br>
they run idle to the main shaft 52. The shift gears 54b<br>
mesh with the corresponding shift gears 53b respectively,<br>
while being spline-connected to the countershaft 55 to<br>
operate in conjunction with the countershaft 55.<br>
The gearbox 51 is also provided with a gearshift<br>
mechanism 56. The gearshift mechanism 56 includes a<br>
shift fork and a shift drum, for example, and selectively<br>
moves the shift gears 53a, 53b, 54a, 54b in the axial<br>
direction of the main shaft 52 or the countershaft 55.<br>
Then, the gearshift mechanism 56 causes the shift gears<br>
53b, 54a, which are provided to turn free to the<br>
corresponding shafts, to connect with the adjacent shift<br>
gears 53a, 54b, which operate in conjunction with the<br>
corresponding shafts. This changes the shift gears 53a,<br>
54b, 54a, 54b to transmit torque from the main shaft 52<br>
to the countershaft 55. The gearshift mechanism 56 is<br>
actuated by receiving power from a shift actuator 16 to<br>
be discussed later.<br>
The transmission mechanism 57 is designed to<br>
decelerate the rotation of the countershaft 55 and<br>
transmit the decelerated rotation to the axle 3a of the<br>
12<br><br>
rear wheel 3. In this example, the transmission<br>
mechanism 57 includes: a drive-side member 57a (for<br>
example, drive-side sprocket), which operates in<br>
conjunction with the countershaft 55; a driven-side<br>
member 57b (for example, driven-side sprocket), which<br>
operates in conjunction with the axle 3a; and a<br>
transmission member 57c (for example, chain), which<br>
transmits torque from the drive-side member 57a to the<br>
driven-side member 57b.<br>
Torque outputted from the engine 30 is transmitted<br>
to the drive-side member 41 of the clutch 40 via the<br>
primary deceleration mechanism 36. The torque<br>
transmitted to the drive-side member 41 is transmitted to<br>
the axle 3a of the rear wheel 3 via the driven-side<br>
member 42, the gearbox 51, and the transmission mechanism<br>
57, in the case that the clutch 40 is engaged or the<br>
drive-side member 41 and the driven-side member 42<br>
contact each other, that is, the clutch 40 is in a half-<br>
clutch state.<br>
Now, a configuration of the clutch controller 10 is<br>
described. The motorcycle 1 is a semi-automatic vehicle<br>
which changes the shift gears of the gearbox 51 without<br>
the need for the rider to operate the clutch. The clutch<br>
controller 10 controls the degree of engagement of the<br>
clutch 40 (relative positions of the drive-side member 41<br>
13<br><br>
and the driven-side member 42) , and changes the shift<br>
gears 53a, 53a, 54a, 54b. FIG. 3 is a block diagram<br>
illustrating a configuration of the clutch controller 10.<br>
As shown in FIG. 3, the clutch controller 10 is provided<br>
with a control unit 11, a storage unit 12, a clutch<br>
actuator drive circuit 13, a clutch actuator 14, a shift<br>
actuator drive circuit 15, a shift actuator 16, an<br>
accelerator operation detector 17, an engine speed<br>
detector 18, a vehicle speed detector 19, a gear position<br>
detector 21, a clutch position detector 22, and clutch<br>
rotational speed detectors 23a, 23b. The control unit 11<br>
is connected to a shift-up switch 9a and a shift-down<br>
switch 9b.<br>
The control unit 11 includes a central processing<br>
unit (CPU) and operates in accordance with programs<br>
stored in the storage unit 12. Specifically, the control<br>
unit 11 changes the shift gears 53a, 53a, 54a, 54b of the<br>
gearbox 51 according to the rider's gearshift operation<br>
(in this example, switching the shift-up switch 9a or the<br>
shift-down switch 9b ON), while controlling the degree of<br>
engagement of the clutch 40 during engaging operation<br>
thereof. The processing executed by the control unit 11<br>
will be discussed in detail later.<br>
The storage unit 12 includes a nonvolatile memory<br>
and a volatile memory. The storage unit 12 stores in<br>
14<br><br>
advance programs executed by the control unit 11 and<br>
tables or expressions used for the processing in the<br>
control unit 11. These tables and expressions will be<br>
discussed in details later.<br>
The clutch actuator drive circuit 13 supplies drive<br>
voltage or drive current the clutch actuator 14 in<br>
accordance with a control signal inputted from the<br>
control unit 11. The clutch actuator 14 includes, for<br>
example, a motor and a power transmission mechanism (such<br>
as hydraulic path and wire) , and is driven by receiving<br>
the electric power supplied by the clutch actuator drive<br>
circuit 13. In this example, the clutch actuator 14<br>
presses a push rod 43 or releases the pressed push rod 43.<br>
When the push rod 43 is pressed by the clutch actuator 14,<br>
it moves the drive-side member 41 and the driven-side<br>
member 42 away from each other against the elastic force<br>
of the clutch spring 44, so that the clutch 40 is<br>
disengaged. In contrast, when the pressed push rod 43 is<br>
released by the clutch actuator 14, it returns to its<br>
original position (the position at the time when the<br>
clutch 40 is engaged) using the elastic force of the<br>
clutch spring 44. Thus, the drive-side member 41 and the<br>
driven-side member 42 approach each other, so that the<br>
clutch 40 is engaged. In addition, the clutch actuator<br>
14 puts the clutch 40 to be in a half-clutch state during<br>
15<br><br>
engaging operation of the clutch 40. When the clutch 40<br>
is in a half-clutch state, only part of torque of the<br>
engine 30 is transmitted from the drive-side member 41 to<br>
the driven-side member 42.<br>
The shift actuator drive circuit 15 supplies drive<br>
voltage or drive current to the shift actuator 16 in<br>
accordance with a control signal inputted from the<br>
control unit 11. The shift actuator 16 includes, for<br>
example, a motor and a power transmission mechanism (such<br>
as hydraulic path and wire) , and is driven by receiving<br>
the electric power supplied from the shift actuator drive<br>
circuit 15. The shift actuator 16 actuates the gearshift<br>
mechanism 56 to change the shift gears 53a, 53b, 54a, 54b<br>
to transmit torque from the main shaft 52 to the<br>
countershaft 55, in order to change the deceleration<br>
ratios.<br>
The accelerator operation detector 17 is designed<br>
to detect an amount of the accelerator operation by the<br>
rider (hereinafter referred to as accelerator<br>
displacement) . Examples of the accelerator operation<br>
detector 17 are a throttle position sensor for detecting<br>
a throttle opening and an accelerator position sensor<br>
mounted to the accelerator grip 5a to detect a rotation<br>
angle of the accelerator grip 5a. Based on the signal<br>
outputted from the accelerator operation detector 17, the<br>
16<br><br>
control unit 11 detects the accelerator displacement by<br>
the rider.<br>
The engine speed detector 18 is designed to detect<br>
a rotational speed of the engine 30 (hereinafter referred<br>
to as engine speed). Example of the engine speed<br>
detector 18 are a crank angle sensor for outputting a<br>
pulse signal with a frequency according to the rotational<br>
speed of the crankshaft 43 or the primary deceleration<br>
gears 36a, 36b and a tachogenerator for outputting a<br>
voltage signal according to the rotational speed thereof.<br>
The control unit 11 calculates the engine speed based on<br>
the signal inputted from the engine speed detector 18.<br>
The vehicle speed detector 19 is designed to detect<br>
a vehicle speed and outputs a signal to the control unit<br>
11 according to, for example, the rotational speed of the<br>
axle 3a of the rear wheel 3 or that of the countershaft<br>
55. The control unit 11 calculates the vehicle speed<br>
based on the signal. The vehicle speed detector 19 may<br>
output a signal to the control unit 11 according to the<br>
rotational speed of the main shaft 52. In this case, the<br>
control unit 11 calculates the vehicle speed not only<br>
based on the input signal, but also based on the<br>
deceleration ratio of the gearbox 51 and that of the<br>
transmission mechanism 57.<br>
The gear position detector 21 is designed to detect<br>
17<br><br>
positions of the shift gears 53a, 53b, 54a, 54b provided<br>
movably in the axial direction of the countershaft 55 or<br>
the main shaft 52. An example of the gear position<br>
detector 21 is a potentiometer mounted to the gearshift<br>
mechanism 56 or the shift actuator 16. The gear position<br>
detector 21 outputs a signal to the control unit 11<br>
according to the positions of the shift gears 53a, 53b,<br>
54a, 54b. Based on the input signal, the control unit 11<br>
detects that movements of the shift gears 53a, 53b, 54a,<br>
54b, which are associated with the gear shifting, have<br>
been completed.<br>
The clutch position detector 22 is designed to<br>
detect the degree of engagement of the clutch 40.<br>
Examples of the clutch position detector 22 are a<br>
potentiometer for outputting a signal according to the<br>
position of the push rod 43 and a potentiometer for<br>
outputting a signal according to the position or the<br>
rotation angle of the output shaft of the clutch actuator<br>
14. Based on the signal inputted from the clutch<br>
position detector 22, the control unit 11 detects the<br>
degree of engagement of the clutch 40.<br>
The clutch rotational speed detector 23a is<br>
designed to detect the rotational speed of the drive-side<br>
member 41 (hereinafter referred to as rotational speed of<br>
the drive-side member 41). Examples of the clutch<br>
18<br><br>
rotational speed detector 23a are a rotary encoder for<br>
outputting a pulse signal with a frequency according to<br>
the rotational speed of the drive-side member 41 and a<br>
tachogenerator for outputting a voltage signal according<br>
to the rotational speed of the drive-side member 41. In<br>
turn, the clutch rotational speed detector 23b is<br>
designed to detect the rotational speed of the driven-<br>
side member 42 (hereinafter referred to as rotational<br>
speed of the driven-side member 42). Examples of the<br>
clutch rotational speed detector 23b are a rotary encoder<br>
and a tachogenerator, as described for the clutch<br>
rotational speed detector 23a.<br>
The shift-up switch 9a and the shift-down switch 9b<br>
are designed for the rider to provide instructions to<br>
change the shift gears 53a, 53b, 54a, 54b to the clutch<br>
controller 11. These switches 9a, 9b output a signal to<br>
the control unit 11 according to the gear shift<br>
instructions. The control unit 11 actuates the shift<br>
actuator 16 according to the input signal to change the<br>
shift gears 53a, 53b, 54a, 54b to transmit torque from<br>
the main shaft 52 to the countershaft 55. The shift-up<br>
switch 9a and the shift-down switch 9b are provided<br>
adjacent to the accelerator grip 5a, for example.<br>
Now, description is made of the processing executed<br>
by the control unit 11. The control unit 11 obtains<br>
19<br><br>
torque Tac transmitted from the drive-side member 41 to<br>
the downstream mechanism (such as the driven-side member<br>
42, or the countershaft 55 and the axle 3a located<br>
downstream of the driven-side member 42) in the torque<br>
transmission path including the driven-side member 42<br>
(hereinafter the torque is referred to as actual<br>
transmission torque). In addition, the control unit 11<br>
obtains torque Treq, which is requested by the rider,<br>
according to the accelerator displacement detected by the<br>
accelerator operation detector 17 (hereinafter the torque<br>
is referred to as request transmission torque). Further,<br>
the control unit 11 obtains torque Ttg which is supposed<br>
to be transmitted from the drive-side member 41 to the<br>
downstream mechanism (hereinafter the torque is referred<br>
target transmission torque). Then, in an operation range<br>
in which the torque outputted from the engine 30<br>
decreases as the engine speed increases (hereinafter the<br>
operation range is referred to as torque-decreasing<br>
operation range), the control unit 11 sets the target<br>
transmission torque Ttg at the request transmission<br>
torque Treq, and actuates the clutch actuator 14<br>
according a difference between the actual transmission<br>
torque Tac and the target transmission torque Ttg, such<br>
that Tac approximates Ttg (hereinafter this control is<br>
referred to as request follow-up control (first control)).<br>
20<br><br>
First, the operation range of the engine 30 is<br>
described. FIG. 4 is a graph illustrating the operation<br>
range of the engine 30. In FIG. 4, the horizontal axis<br>
represents engine speed, and the vertical axis represents<br>
torque TEac produced by the engine 30 (hereinafter<br>
referred to as EG torque). The graph illustrates torque<br>
curves LI to L3 representing output characteristics of<br>
the engine 30. The torque curve LI shows the<br>
relationship between the engine speed and the EG torque<br>
TEac, if the accelerator displacement is large or the<br>
accelerator grip 5a is operated greatly. In turn, the<br>
torque curve L3 shows the relationship between the engine<br>
speed and the EG torque TEac, if the accelerator<br>
displacement is small. The torque curve L2 shows the<br>
relationship between the engine speed and the EG torque<br>
TEac, if the accelerator displacement is moderate.<br>
If the accelerator displacement is large, the<br>
torque curve LI shows the maximum EG torque TEac at the<br>
engine speed of a value Rpeak. In the operation range in<br>
which the engine speed is lower than the value Rpeak, the<br>
EG torque TEac increases as the engine speed increases.<br>
In contrast, in the operation range in which the engine<br>
speed is higher than the value Rpeak, the EG torque TEac<br>
decreases as the engine speed increases. In turn, in the<br>
operation range in which the accelerator displacement is<br>
21<br><br>
small and in the operation range in which the accelerator<br>
displacement is moderate, the torque curves L2 and L3<br>
show at any engine speed that the engine torque TEac<br>
decreases as the engine speed increases.<br>
Now, overview of the request follow-up control is<br>
described. FIG. 5(a) to 5(c) illustrate the overview of<br>
the request follow-up control, and are time charts<br>
respectively showing examples of changes in degree of<br>
engagement of the clutch 40, target transmission torque<br>
Ttg, actual transmission torque Tac, and EG torque TEac<br>
in the case the request follow-up control is performed in<br>
the torque-decreasing operation range. FIG. 5(a) shows<br>
the degree of engagement of the clutch 40. FIG. 5(b)<br>
shows the target transmission torque Ttg. FIG. 5(c)<br>
shows the actual transmission torque Tac and the EG<br>
torque TEac. FIG. 6 illustrates changes in engine speed<br>
and EG torque TEac in the case when the request follow-up<br>
control is performed in the torque-decreasing operation<br>
range. In FIG. 6, the horizontal axis represents engine<br>
speed, and the vertical axis represents EG torque. In<br>
addition, a line L2 shown in FIG. 6 is a torque curve in<br>
the case of the aforementioned medium accelerator<br>
displacement. FIG. 6 shows the EG torque TEac obtained<br>
at the point in time immediately before the time t2 in<br>
FIG. 5, and so forth. Hereinafter, the EG torque TEac is<br>
22<br><br>
described as a value obtained by multiplying the torque<br>
on the drive-side member 41 or the torque outputted from<br>
the engine 30 by the gear ratio of the primary<br>
deceleration mechanism 36 (the number of teeth of the<br>
driven-side primary deceleration gear 36b / the number of<br>
teeth of the drive-side primary deceleration gear 36a) .<br>
In turn, the actual transmission torque Tac is described<br>
as torque transmitted to the driven-side member 42 in the<br>
mechanism downstream of the drive-side member 41.<br>
At tl, when the rider operates the accelerator grip<br>
5a and thus the start-up conditions, to be discussed<br>
later, are satisfied, the control unit 11 sets the target<br>
transmission torque Ttg as the request transmission<br>
torque Treq, which is determined according to the<br>
accelerator displacement by the rider, as shown in FIG.<br>
5(b). As shown in FIG. 5(c), at this time when the<br>
accelerator grip 5a is operated, the EG torque TEac<br>
increases. After that, as shown in FIGs. 5(a) and 5(c),<br>
the control unit 11 actuates the clutch actuator 14<br>
according to the difference between the target<br>
transmission torque Ttg and the actual transmission<br>
torque Tac in order to gradually enhance the degree of<br>
engagement of the clutch 40. Thereby, the control unit<br>
11 allows the actual transmission torque Tac to<br>
approximate the target transmission torque Ttg (the<br>
23<br><br>
request transmission torque Treq under this control).<br>
Then, at t2, the actual transmission torque Tac reaches<br>
the target transmission torque Ttg. After that, because<br>
the difference between the actual transmission torque Tac<br>
and the target transmission torque Ttg is almost<br>
eliminated, the control unit 11 keeps the degree of<br>
engagement of the clutch 40 approximately constant.<br>
After that, at t3, when the difference between the<br>
rotational speed of the drive-side member 41 and the<br>
rotational speed of the driven-side member 42<br>
(hereinafter referred to as clutch rotational speed<br>
difference) falls below a predetermined value<br>
(hereinafter referred to as rotational speed difference<br>
for discontinuing half-clutch (for example, a value 0 or<br>
a value close to 0)), the control unit 11 allows the<br>
clutch 40 to be completely engaged.<br>
As shown in FIG. 5 (c), generally there is a<br>
difference between the EG torque TEac and the actual<br>
transmission torque Tac when the clutch 40 is in a half-<br>
clutch state. If the EG torque TEac is higher than the<br>
actual transmission torque Tac, the difference<br>
therebetween contributes to an increase in engine speed;<br>
therefore, the engine speed increases at a rate according<br>
to the difference. Thus, as shown in FIG. 5(c), when the<br>
EG torque TEac increases at tl and becomes higher than<br>
24<br><br>
the actual transmission torque Tac, the engine speed<br>
increases. Then, as shown in FIG. 6 and FIG. 5(c), the<br>
EG torque TEac outputted from the engine 30 decreases as<br>
the engine speed increases. Then, as shown in FIG. 5(c),<br>
at t3, the EG torque TEac corresponds with the actual<br>
transmission torque Tac that has already reached the<br>
target transmission torque Ttg. In other words, the EG<br>
torque TEac, the actual transmission torque Tac, and the<br>
request transmission torque Treq correspond with each<br>
other. Up to this point, the discussion has been made<br>
with its focus on the overview of the request follow-up<br>
control and the changes in degree of engagement of the<br>
clutch 40 and so forth with respect to time in the case<br>
when the request follow-up control is performed.<br>
If the EG torque TEac is lower than the actual<br>
transmission torque Tac, torque produced by the inertia<br>
of the internal mechanism of the engine 30 such as the<br>
crankshaft 34 (hereinafter referred to as inertia torque<br>
TIac) is transmitted as part of the actual transmission<br>
torque Tac via the clutch 40. Therefore, the engine<br>
speed decreases. Thus, under this control, when the EG<br>
torque TEac falls below the actual transmission torque<br>
Tac, the engine speed switches from increasing to<br>
decreasing, and the EG torque TEac thus starts increasing,<br>
thereby approaching the actual transmission torque Tac.<br>
25<br><br>
Consequently, in this operation range, when the control<br>
is performed such that the actual transmission torque Tac<br>
approximates the target transmission torque Ttg, which is<br>
set at the request transmission torque Treq, the engine<br>
speed converges to an engine speed Rreq at which torque<br>
equal to the request transmission torque Treq is<br>
outputted as the EG torque TEac (hereinafter the engine<br>
speed is referred to as request torque rotational speed)<br>
(see FIG. 6).<br>
However, as under the request follow-up control<br>
described above, the target transmission torque Ttg is<br>
set on the request transmission torque Treq, and the<br>
clutch actuator 14 is actuated according to the<br>
difference between the target transmission torque Ttg and<br>
the actual transmission torque Tac, such control,<br>
depending on the operation range of the engine 30, can<br>
cause the engine speed to continue to increase or<br>
decrease without converging to a constant value or can<br>
require a long time period for the engine speed to<br>
converge to a constant value. For example, the engine<br>
speed continues to increase or decrease in the operation<br>
range in which the EG torque TEac increases, following<br>
the increase in the engine speed (in the example of FIG.<br>
4, this operation range is shown in a part of the torque<br>
curve LI where the engine speed is lower than the value<br>
26<br><br>
Rpeak, and is hereinafter referred to as torque-<br>
increasing operation range) . The reasons for this event<br>
are described below.<br>
FIG. 7 illustrates changes in engine speed in the<br>
case when the aforementioned control is performed in the<br>
torque-increasing operation range. In FIG. 7, the<br>
horizontal axis represents engine speed, and the vertical<br>
axis represents EG torque TEac. The LI in FIG. 7 is a<br>
part of the torque curve LI shown in FIG. 4, where the<br>
engine speed is lower than Rpeak. Also, in FIG. 7, the<br>
point El represents the EG torque TEac that is higher<br>
than the actual transmission torque Tac, and the point E2<br>
represents the EG torque TEac that is lower than the<br>
actual transmission torque Tac.<br>
As described above, if the EG torque TEac is higher<br>
than the actual transmission torque Tac, the engine speed<br>
increases. Thus, in this case, as shown the point El in<br>
FIG. 7, the EG torque TEac further deviates from the<br>
actual transmission torque Tac as the engine speed<br>
increases so that the engine speed continues to increase.<br>
Also as described above, if the EG torque TEac is lower<br>
than the actual transmission torque Tac, the engine speed<br>
decreases. Thus, in this case, as shown the point E2 in<br>
FIG. 7, the EG torque TEac further deviates from the<br>
actual transmission torque Tac as the engine speed<br>
27<br><br>
decreases so that the engine speed continues to decrease.<br>
Thus, in the case where the clutch 40 is controlled such<br>
that the actual transmission torque Tac approximates the<br>
request transmission torque Treq in the torque-increasing<br>
operation range, the engine speed could become<br>
excessively high or low without converging to the request<br>
torque rotational speed Rreq in this operation range,<br>
even if the actual transmission torque Tac has reached<br>
the request transmission torque Treq.<br>
Therefore, in the torque-increasing operation range,<br>
the control unit 11 performs to prevent the engine speed<br>
from excessively increasing or decreasing, instead of the<br>
request follow-up control. Specifically, if the EG<br>
torque TEac is higher than the request transmission<br>
torque Treq, the control unit 11 actuates the clutch<br>
actuator 14 such that the actual transmission torque Tac<br>
approximates the EG torque TEac (hereinafter this control<br>
is referred to as rotational speed maintaining control<br>
(the second control)). For example, under the rotational<br>
speed maintaining control, the control unit 11 sets the<br>
target transmission torque Ttg at the EG torque TEac and<br>
actuates the clutch actuator 14 according to the<br>
difference between the target transmission torque Ttg and<br>
the actual transmission torque Tac, such that Tac<br>
approximates Ttg.<br>
28<br><br>
FIGs. 8(a) to 8(c) are time charts respectively<br>
showing examples of changes in degree of engagement of<br>
the clutch 40, target transmission torque Ttg, actual<br>
transmission torque Tac, and of EG torque TEac when the<br>
rotational speed maintaining control is performed. FIG.<br>
8(a) shows the degree of engagement of the clutch 40.<br>
FIG. 8(b) shows the target transmission torque Ttg. FIG.<br>
8 (c) shows the actual transmission torque Tac and the EG<br>
torque TEac. In FIG. 8(b), the request transmission<br>
torque Treq is shown by a broken line. FIG. 9<br>
illustrates changes in engine speed and EG torque TEac<br>
when the rotational speed maintaining control is<br>
performed. In FIG. 9, the horizontal axis represents<br>
engine speed, and the vertical axis represents EG torque.<br>
The Ll in FIG. 9 is a part of the torque curve LI shown<br>
in FIG. 4, where the engine speed is lower than Rpeak.<br>
FIG. 9 shows the EG torque TEac at the point immediately<br>
before t2 in FIG. 8, and so forth.<br>
At tl, when the rider operates the accelerator grip<br>
5a, and thus, the vehicle start-up conditions are<br>
satisfied, the EG torque TEac increases as shown in FIG.<br>
8 (c) . Then, if the EG torque TEac exceeds the request<br>
transmission torque Treq determined according to the<br>
accelerator displacement, the control unit 11 sets the<br>
target transmission torque Ttg not at the request<br>
29<br><br>
transmission torque Treq but at the EG torque TEac, as<br>
shown in FIG. 8(b). After that, as shown in FIGs. 8(a)<br>
and 8(c), the control unit 11 actuates the clutch<br>
actuator 14 according to the difference between the<br>
target transmission torque Ttg (EG torque TEac in this<br>
example) and the actual transmission torque Tac in order<br>
to gradually enhance the degree of engagement of the<br>
clutch 40. Thereby, the control unit 11 allows the<br>
actual transmission torque Tac to approximate the EG<br>
torque TEac. Consequently, as shown in FIG. 8(c), the<br>
actual transmission torque Tac reaches the EG torque TEac<br>
at t2. After that, at t3, when the clutch rotational<br>
speed difference falls below the rotational speed<br>
difference for discontinuing half-clutch, the control<br>
unit 11 allows the clutch 40 to be completely engaged.<br>
In addition, as shown in FIG. 8 (c) , the EG torque<br>
TEac increases at tl and is thus higher than the actual<br>
transmission torque Tac. Therefore, the engine speed<br>
keeps increasing from tl onwards. Then, as shown in FIG.<br>
9 and FIG. 8(c), in the torque-increasing operation range,<br>
the EG torque TEac increases as the engine speed<br>
increases. However, control by the control unit 11<br>
allows the difference between the actual transmission<br>
torque Tac and the EG torque TEac to be eliminated at the<br>
30<br><br>
point (t2) where the actual transmission torque Tac<br>
reaches the target transmission torque Ttg, and thus, the<br>
engine speed stops increasing. Up to this point, the<br>
discussion has focused on the overview of the rotational<br>
speed maintaining control.<br>
Now, description is made of the control to be<br>
performed if the engine 30 operates in the torque-<br>
increasing operation range, and if the EG torque TEac is<br>
lower than the request transmission torque Treq. In this<br>
case, the control unit 11 actuates the clutch actuator 14<br>
such that the engine speed increases to a predetermined<br>
engine speed (hereinafter this control is referred to as<br>
rotational speed induction control). Specifically, the<br>
control unit 11 actuates the clutch actuator 14 such that<br>
the engine speed increases or decreases to an engine<br>
speed determined according to the request transmission<br>
torque Treq. For example, the control unit 11 sets the<br>
target transmission torque Ttg such that either one of<br>
the target transmission torque Ttg and the request<br>
transmission torque Treq is higher than the EG torque<br>
TEac while the other is lower than the EG torque TEac.<br>
More specifically, if the EG torque TEac is lower than<br>
the request transmission torque Treq, the control unit 11<br>
sets the target transmission torque Ttg at a value lower<br>
than the EG torque TEac. In addition, the control unit<br>
31<br><br>
11 allows the target transmission torque Ttg to gradually-<br>
approximate the request transmission torque Treq during<br>
engaging operation of the clutch 40.<br>
FIGs. 10(a) to 10(c) are time charts respectively-<br>
showing examples of changes in degree of engagement of<br>
the clutch 40, target transmission torque Ttg, request<br>
transmission torque Treq, EG torque TEac, and actual<br>
transmission torque Tac in the case when the rotational<br>
speed induction control is performed. FIG. 10(a) shows<br>
the degree of engagement of the clutch 40. FIG. 10(b)<br>
shows the target transmission torque Ttg, the request<br>
transmission torque Treq and the EG torque TEac. FIG.<br>
10(c) shows the actual transmission torque Tac and the EG<br>
torque TEac. FIG. 11 is a graph illustrating changes in<br>
engine speed and EG torque in the case when the<br>
rotational speed induction control is performed. In FIG.<br>
11, the horizontal axis represents engine speed, and the<br>
vertical axis represents EG torque. The Ll in FIG. 11 is<br>
a part of the torque curve Ll shown in FIG. 4, where the<br>
engine speed is lower than Rpeak. In addition, FIG. 11<br>
shows the EG torque TEac and so forth from t2 onwards in<br>
FIGs. 10(a) to 10 (c) .<br>
At tl, when the rider operates the accelerator grip<br>
5a and thus the vehicle start-up conditions are satisfied,<br>
the EG torque TEac increases as shown in FIG. 10(c).<br>
32<br><br>
Then, as shown in FIG. 10(b), unless the EG torque TEac<br>
exceeds the request transmission torque Treq determined<br>
according to the accelerator displacement, the control<br>
unit 11 performs the rotational speed induction control.<br>
Specifically, the control unit 11 sets the target<br>
transmission torque Ttg at a value lower than the EG<br>
torque TEac. Then, the control unit 11 actuates the<br>
clutch actuator 14 according to the difference between<br>
the target transmission torque Ttg and the actual<br>
transmission torque Tac. Thereby, as shown in FIGs.<br>
10(a) and 10(c), the control unit 11 enhances the degree<br>
of engagement of the clutch 40 gradually in order to<br>
allow the actual transmission torque Tac to approximate<br>
the target transmission torque T+g. Then, at t2, the<br>
actual transmission torque Tac reaches the target<br>
transmission torque Ttg.<br>
In addition, as shown in FIG. 10(c), the EG torque<br>
TEac increases at the time tl and becomes higher than the<br>
actual transmission torque Tac, and thus, the engine<br>
speed increases. Then, as shown in FIG. 11 and FIG.<br>
10(c), in the torque-increasing operation range, the EG<br>
torque TEac increases as the engine speed increases.<br>
Under this control, the control unit 11 sets the target<br>
transmission torque Ttg at a value lower than the EG<br>
torque TEac, while gradually increasing the target<br>
33<br><br>
transmission torque Ttg to the request transmission<br>
torque Treq. Thus, from t2 onwards, the actual<br>
transmission torque Tac follows the target transmission<br>
torque Ttg, approximating the request transmission torque<br>
Treq. Consequently, as shown in FIG. 10(b), at t3, the<br>
request transmission torque Treq, the target transmission<br>
torque Ttg, and the EG torque TEac are equal to each<br>
other, and thus the difference is eliminated between the<br>
actual transmission torque Tac and the EG torque TEac.<br>
Thereby, the engine speed converges to an engine speed<br>
that is determined according to the request transmission<br>
torque Treq (in this example, engine speed Rreq at which<br>
the EG torque TEac equals to the request transmission<br>
torque is outputted) . Up to this point, the discussion<br>
has focused on the overview of the rotational speed<br>
induction control.<br>
The processing executed by the control unit 11 is<br>
discussed in detail. FIG. 12 is a block diagram<br>
illustrating the processing functions of the control unit<br>
11. As shown in FIG. 12, the control unit 11 includes an<br>
EG torque obtaining section 11a, an actual torque<br>
obtaining section lib, a request torque obtaining section<br>
lid, a range determining section lie, a target torque<br>
setting section llf, a clutch actuator control section<br>
llg, and a shift actuator control section llh. The<br>
34<br><br>
actual torque obtaining section lib includes an inertia<br>
torque obtaining section lie.<br>
Description is first made of the processing<br>
executed by the EG torque obtaining section 11a. The EG<br>
torque obtaining section 11a executes the processing for<br>
obtaining the EG torque TEac currently outputted from the<br>
engine 30. For example, the storage unit 12 stores in<br>
advance a table that establishes the correspondence<br>
between the EG torque TEac, and the engine speed and the<br>
accelerator displacement (hereinafter the table is<br>
referred to as EG torque table). Then, the EG torque<br>
obtaining section 11a detects the accelerator<br>
displacement based on the signal inputted from the<br>
accelerator operation detector 17, while detecting the<br>
engine speed based on the signal inputted from the engine<br>
speed detector 18. Then, the EG torque obtaining section<br>
11a refers to the EG torque table to obtain the EG torque<br>
TEac that corresponds to the detected accelerator<br>
displacement and engine speed. As mentioned above, the<br>
EG torque TEac is defined herein as a value obtained by<br>
multiplying the torque outputted from the engine 30 by<br>
the gear ratio of the primary deceleration mechanism 36.<br>
In place of the EG torque table, the storage unit<br>
12 may store in advance an expression that represents the<br>
relationship between the engine speed, the accelerator<br>
35<br><br>
displacement and the EG torque TEac (hereinafter the<br>
expression is referred to as EG torque relational<br>
expression). In this case, the EG torque obtaining<br>
section 11a substitutes the detected engine speed and<br>
accelerator displacement into the EG torque relational<br>
expression in order to calculate the current EG torque<br>
TEac.<br>
Alternatively, the EG torque obtaining section 11a<br>
may obtain the EG torque TEac based on pressure of air<br>
flowing through the interior of the intake pipe 35<br>
(hereinafter the pressure is referred to as intake<br>
pressure). For example, the storage unit 12 may store in<br>
advance a table that establishes the correspondence<br>
between the EG torque TEac, and the intake pressure and<br>
the engine speed. In addition, a pressure sensor for<br>
outputting a signal according to the intake pressure is<br>
disposed in the intake pipe 35. In this case, the EG<br>
torque obtaining section 11a detects the engine speed at<br>
the time when the crank angle is a predetermined value<br>
(for example, at the end of intake stroke), while<br>
detecting the intake pressure based on the signal<br>
inputted from the pressure sensor. Then, the EG torque<br>
obtaining section 11a refers to the table stored in the<br>
storage unit 12 to obtain the EG torque TEac that<br>
corresponds to the detected intake pressure and engine<br>
36<br><br>
speed.<br>
Now, description is made of the processing executed<br>
by the actual torque obtaining section lib. The actual<br>
torque obtaining section lib executes the processing for<br>
obtaining the actual transmission torque Tac in a<br>
predetermined cycle (for example, several milliseconds)<br>
during engaging operation of the clutch 40. Specifically,<br>
the actual torque obtaining section lib calculates the<br>
actual transmission torque Tac based on the EG torque<br>
TEac obtained by the EG torque obtaining section 11a and<br>
based on the torque produced due to the inertia of the<br>
mechanism (such as the crankshaft 34, the piston 32 and<br>
the primary deceleration mechanism 36) located upstream<br>
of the drive-side member 41 in the torque transmission<br>
path (i.e. inertia torque TIac).<br>
Description is first made of the processing for<br>
obtaining the inertia torque TIac. The inertia torque<br>
TIac is a value determined according to the variation in<br>
engine speed Qe per unit time (d Q e / dt, hereinafter<br>
referred to as rate-of-change of EG speed) . The storage<br>
unit 12 stores in advance an expression that associates<br>
the inertia torque TIac with the rate-of-change of EG<br>
speed (dQe / dt) . Specifically, the storage unit 12<br>
stores in advance an expression, in which the inertia<br>
torque Tia is equal to a value (I x (dQe / dt)) obtained<br>
37<br><br>
by multiplying the inertial moment I on the mechanism<br>
upstream of the drive-side member 41 by the rate-of-<br>
change of EG speed (dQe / dt) . In this case, the inertia<br>
torque obtaining section lie, included in the actual<br>
torque obtaining section lib, calculates the rate-of-<br>
change of EG speed (dQe / dt) based on the signal<br>
inputted from the engine speed detector 18. Then, the<br>
inertia torque obtaining section lie multiplies the rate-<br>
of-change of EG speed (dQe / dt) by the inertial moment I,<br>
and defines the multiplication result (I x (dQe / dt)) as<br>
inertia torque TIac. The storage unit 12 may store in<br>
advance a table that establishes the correspondence<br>
between the rate-of-change of EG speed (dQe / dt) and the<br>
inertia torque TIac. In this case, the inertia torque<br>
obtaining section lie refers to the table to obtain the<br>
inertia torque TIac that corresponds to the rate-of-<br>
change of EG speed (dQe / dt) .<br>
The actual torque obtaining section 11a assigns the<br>
EG torque TEac and the inertia torque TIac, which are<br>
obtained from the aforementioned processing, to the<br>
expression that is stored in the storage unit 12 in<br>
advance and represents the relationship between the EG<br>
torque TEac, the inertia torque TIac and the actual<br>
transmission torque Tac in order to calculate the actual<br>
transmission torque Tac. For example, the actual torque<br>
38<br><br>
obtaining section lib assigns the inertia torque TIac and<br>
the EG torque TEac to the following expression (1) , and<br>
defines the obtained value as actual transmission torque<br>
Tac.<br>
Tac = TEac - Tiac 	(1)<br>
The actual transmission torque Tac is described<br>
herein as torque transmitted to the driven-side member 42.<br>
However, for example, the actual torque obtaining section<br>
lib may calculate torque transmitted to the countershaft<br>
55 or the mechanism downstream of the countershaft 55 as<br>
actual transmission torque Tac. In this case, the actual<br>
torque obtaining section lib obtains torque by-<br>
multiplying the value, which is obtained from the<br>
aforementioned expression (1), by the deceleration ratio<br>
of the gearbox 51 (the gear ratio of the shift gears<br>
after shifted-up or shifted-down operation (after the<br>
clutch 40 is completely engaged)) and by the deceleration<br>
ratio of the transmission mechanism 57, and defines the<br>
obtained torque as actual transmission torque Tac.<br>
In addition, when the torque produced on the<br>
mechanism upstream of the primary deceleration mechanism<br>
36 is stored as EG torque TEac in the aforementioned EG<br>
torque table, the actual torque obtaining section lib<br>
multiplies the EG torque TEac, which is obtained from the<br>
aforementioned processing, by the deceleration ratio of<br>
39<br><br>
the primary deceleration mechanism 36 (the number of<br>
teeth of the driven-side primary deceleration gear 36b /<br>
the number of teeth of the drive-side primary<br>
deceleration gear 36a) in order to calculate the actual<br>
transmission torque Tac.<br>
The processing for calculating the actual<br>
transmission torque Tac is not limited to the<br>
aforementioned processes. For example, the storage unit<br>
12 may store in advance a table or an expression that<br>
establishes the correspondence between the actual<br>
transmission torque Tac, and the engine speed, the<br>
accelerator displacement and the rate-of-change of EG<br>
speed. In this case, the actual torque obtaining section<br>
lib uses the table or the expression to directly obtain<br>
the actual transmission torque Tac from the engine speed,<br>
the rate-of-change of EG speed and the accelerator<br>
displacement.<br>
Now, description is made of the processing executed<br>
by the request torque obtaining section lid. The request<br>
torque obtaining section lid executes the processing for<br>
obtaining the request transmission torque Treq based on<br>
the accelerator displacement detected by the accelerator<br>
operation detector 17. For example, the storage unit 12<br>
stores in advance a table that establishes the<br>
correspondence between the accelerator displacement by<br>
40<br><br>
the rider and the request transmission torque Treq<br>
(hereinafter the table is referred to as request torque<br>
table). Then, the request torque obtaining section lid<br>
refers to the request torque table to obtain the request<br>
transmission torque Treq that corresponds to the<br>
accelerator displacement detected by the accelerator<br>
operation detector 17. Alternatively, the storage unit<br>
12 may store an expression that represents the<br>
relationship between the accelerator displacement and the<br>
request transmission torque Treq. In this case, the<br>
request torque obtaining section lid assigns the<br>
accelerator displacement detected by the accelerator<br>
operation detector 17 to the expression in order to<br>
calculate the request transmission torque Treq.<br>
FIG. 13 is a graph that indicates an example of the<br>
relationship between the request transmission torque Treq<br>
and the accelerator displacement. On the graph, the<br>
horizontal axis represents accelerator displacement, and<br>
the vertical axis represents request transmission torque<br>
Treq. As shown in FIG. 13, as the accelerator<br>
displacement becomes larger, the request transmission<br>
torque Treq increases. In addition, in the example shown<br>
in FIG. 13, when the accelerator displacement is 0, the<br>
request transmission torque Treq is a negative value.<br>
Now, description is made of the processing executed<br>
41<br><br>
by the range determining section lie. The range<br>
determining section lie determines whether or not the<br>
engine 30 operates in the torque-decreasing operation<br>
range or in the torque-increasing operation range. The<br>
range determining section lie executes this processing as<br>
below, for example.<br>
The storage unit 12 stores in advance an operation<br>
range information correspondence table showing that each<br>
operation range, which is specified by the accelerator<br>
displacement and the engine speed, is either the torque-<br>
increasing operation range or the information indicative<br>
of the torque-decreasing operation range (hereinafter the<br>
table is referred to as range determining table). FIG.<br>
14 shows an example of the range determining table. The<br>
range determining table stores the engine speed on the<br>
top row and the accelerator displacement on the leftmost<br>
column, both of which specify the operation range. In<br>
addition, the range determining table stores, for each<br>
operation range specified by the accelerator displacement<br>
and the engine speed, the information indicating that the<br>
operation range is either the torque-increasing operation<br>
range or the torque-decreasing operation range. In FIG.<br>
14, for example, in the operation range with 3000rpm<br>
engine speed and 100% accelerator displacement, the<br>
information indicating that this operation range is the<br>
42<br><br>
torque-increasing operation range ("increase" in FIG. 14)<br>
is stored. In turn, in the operation range with 9000rpm<br>
engine speed and 5% accelerator displacement, the<br>
information indicating that this operation range is the<br>
torque-decreasing operation range ("decrease" in FIG. 14)<br>
is stored. In the case where the storage unit 12 stores<br>
such a range determining table, the range determining<br>
section lie refers to the range determining table to<br>
determine whether the operation range that corresponds to<br>
the accelerator displacement and the engine speed<br>
detected by the respective detectors is the torque-<br>
increasing operation range or the torque-decreasing<br>
operation range. Alternatively, before or during the<br>
engaging operation of the clutch 40, the range<br>
determining section lie may estimate whether or not the<br>
EG torque TEac approximates the request transmission<br>
torque Treq in the case where the aforementioned request<br>
follow-up control is performed, and determine the current<br>
operation range based on the estimation result.<br>
Specifically, if the EG torque TEac is estimated to<br>
approximate the request transmission torque Treq, the<br>
range determining section lie determines that the current<br>
operation range is the torque-decreasing operation range.<br>
In contrast, if the EG torque TEac is estimated to<br>
deviate from the request transmission torque Treq, the<br>
43<br><br>
range determining section lie determines that the current<br>
operation range is the torque-increasing operation range.<br>
This processing is executed as follows, for example.<br>
The range determining section lie refers to the EG<br>
torque table to obtain the engine speed, at which the<br>
torque that equals to the request transmission torque is<br>
outputted as the EG torque TEac, that is, the request<br>
torque rotational speed Rreq. FIG. 15 shows an example<br>
of the EG torque table. In this table, the engine speed<br>
is listed on the top row and the accelerator displacement<br>
is listed in the leftmost column. The table also<br>
establishes the correspondence between each engine speed<br>
and accelerator displacement, and the EG torque TEac. In<br>
the case where the storage unit 12 stores such an EG<br>
torque table and for example, the accelerator<br>
displacement is 75% and the request transmission torque<br>
Treq is 1.00, the range determining section lie refers to<br>
this EG Torque table and obtains the request torque<br>
rotational speed Rreq of 6050rpm.<br>
In addition, the range determining section lie<br>
estimates the tendency of changes in the engine speed<br>
when the request follow-up control is performed.<br>
Specifically, if the request transmission torque Treq is<br>
higher than the EG torque TEac, the actual transmission<br>
torque Tac made higher than the EG torque TEac<br>
44<br><br>
accordingly by the request follow-up control. Therefore,<br>
the range determining section lie estimates that the<br>
engine speed decreases. In contrast, if the request<br>
transmission torque Treq is lower than the EG torque .TEac,<br>
the range determining section lie estimates that the<br>
engine speed increases under the request follow-up<br>
control.<br>
Then, if the current engine speed increases or<br>
decreases as estimated, the range determining section lie<br>
determines whether or not the current engine speed<br>
approximates the request torque rotational speed Rreq.<br>
For example, if the current engine speed is 5000rpm and<br>
is estimated to increase, this engine speed approximates<br>
the request torque rotational speed Rreq (6050rpm in the<br>
aforementioned example) (see FIG. 15). In this case,<br>
because the EG torque TEac also approximates the request<br>
transmission torque Treq (1.00 in the aforementioned<br>
example) accordingly, the range determining section lie<br>
determines that the engine 30 currently operates in the<br>
torque-decreasing operation range. In contrast, if the<br>
engine speed is estimated to decrease, the engine speed<br>
deviates from the request torque rotational speed Rreq<br>
(6050rpm in the aforementioned example), and accordingly,<br>
the EG torque TEac deviates from the request transmission<br>
torque Treq (see FIG. 15) . In this case, the range<br>
45<br><br>
determining section lie determines that the engine 30<br>
operates in the torque-increasing operation range.<br>
Now, description is made of the target torque<br>
setting section llf. The target torque setting section<br>
llf sets the target transmission torque according to the<br>
determination result made by the range determination<br>
section lie. Specifically, if the engine 30 operates in<br>
the torque-decreasing operation range, the target torque<br>
setting section llf regards the request transmission<br>
torque Treq obtained by the processing of the request<br>
torque obtaining section lid as the target transmission<br>
torque Ttg.<br>
In turn, if the engine 30 operates in the torque-<br>
increasing operation range, the target torque setting<br>
section llf sets the target transmission torque Ttg<br>
depending on a positive or negative value of the<br>
difference between the EG torque TEac and the request<br>
transmission torque Treq. Specifically, if the EG torque<br>
TEac is higher than the request transmission torque Treq,<br>
the target torque setting section llf sets the target<br>
transmission torque Ttg as the EG torque TEac.<br>
In contrast, if the EG torque TEac is lower than<br>
the request transmission torque Treq, the target torque<br>
setting section llf sets a value lower than the EG torque<br>
Teac as the target transmission torque Ttg. In addition,<br>
46<br><br>
the target torque setting section llf gradually reduces<br>
the difference between the target transmission torque Ttg<br>
and the request transmission torque Treq during engaging<br>
operation of the clutch 40. Specifically, the target<br>
torque setting section llf determines the difference<br>
between the target transmission torque Ttg and the EG<br>
torque TEac according to that between the EG torque TEac<br>
and the request transmission torque Treq. For example,<br>
the target torque setting section llf calculates the<br>
target transmission torque Ttg by assigning the EG torque<br>
TEac, which is obtained by the processing of the EG<br>
torque obtaining section 11a, and the request<br>
transmission torque Treq, which is obtained by the<br>
processing of the request torque obtaining section lid,<br>
to the following expression (2) stored in the storage<br>
unit 12 in advance.<br>
Ttg = TEac - (Treq - TEac)(2)<br>
When the target transmission torque Ttg is set in<br>
this manner, the target transmission torque Ttg<br>
approximates the request transmission torque Treq<br>
gradually during engaging operation of the clutch 40. In<br>
other words, as described by referring to FIGs. 10(a) to<br>
10(c) and 11, the actual transmission torque Tac reaches<br>
the target transmission torque Ttg during engaging<br>
operation of the clutch 40. Therefore, when the target<br>
47<br><br>
transmission torque Ttg is lower than the EG torque TEac,<br>
the actual transmission torque Tac also turns out to be<br>
lower than the EG torque TEac. Thus, the engine speed<br>
increases. In the torque-increasing operation range, the<br>
EG torque TEac increases as the engine speed increases.<br>
Thus, the difference between the EG torque TEac and the<br>
request transmission torque Treq is gradually reduced<br>
during engaging operation of the clutch 40; therefore,<br>
the target transmission torque Ttg also gradually<br>
approximates the request transmission torque Treq.<br>
The processing executed by the target torque<br>
setting section llf is not limited to this. For example,<br>
a maximum value ATmax of the difference between the EG<br>
torque TEac and the target transmission torque Ttg may be<br>
given. Thus, if the difference between the request<br>
transmission torque Treq and the EG torque TEac exceeds<br>
the maximum value ATmax, the target torque setting<br>
section llf does not necessarily set the target<br>
transmission torque Ttg by assigning the EG torque TEac<br>
and the request transmission torque Treq to the<br>
expression (2). Alternatively, the target torque setting<br>
section llf may set a value obtained by subtracting the<br>
maximum value ATmax from the EG torque TEac (TEac<br>
ATmax) as the target transmission torque Ttg.<br>
Now, description is made of the processing executed<br>
48<br><br>
by the clutch actuator control section llg. During<br>
engaging operation of the clutch 40, the clutch actuator<br>
control section llg actuates the clutch actuator 14 in a<br>
predetermined cycle based on the difference between the<br>
actual transmission torque Tac and the target<br>
transmission torque Ttg (hereinafter referred to as<br>
torque deviation). Specifically, the clutch actuator<br>
control section llg actuates the clutch actuator 14 by an<br>
amount according to the torque deviation to allow the<br>
actual transmission torque Tac to approximate the target<br>
transmission torque Ttg. The clutch actuator control<br>
section llg executes the following processing, for<br>
example.<br>
The storage unit 12 stores in advance an expression<br>
that represents the relationship between the torque<br>
deviation (Ttg - Tac) and the amount by which the clutch<br>
actuator 14 is actuated (hereinafter the amount is<br>
referred to as command actuation amount) (hereinafter the<br>
expression is referred to as actuation amount relational<br>
expression). The clutch actuator control section llg<br>
calculates the torque deviation (Ttg - Tac) in a<br>
predetermined cycle during engaging operation of the<br>
clutch 40. Then, the clutch actuator control section llg<br>
substitutes the torque deviation (Ttg - Tac) into the<br>
actuation amount relational expression in order to<br>
49<br><br>
calculate the command actuation amount, and outputs a<br>
control signal to the clutch actuator drive circuit 13<br>
according to the calculated command actuation amount.<br>
The clutch actuator drive circuit 13 outputs electric<br>
power to drive the clutch actuator 14 according to the<br>
control signal.<br>
FIG. 16 is a graph showing the relationship between<br>
the torque deviation (Ttg - Tac) and the command<br>
actuation amount obtained from the actuation amount<br>
relational expression. In an example shown in FIG. 16,<br>
the actuation amount relational expression is established<br>
such that if the torque deviation (Ttg - Tac) is positive,<br>
the clutch actuator 14 is actuated in the direction to<br>
engage the clutch 40. In turn, the actuation amount<br>
relational expression is established such that if the<br>
torque deviation (Ttg - Tac) is negative, the clutch<br>
actuator 14 is actuated in the direction to disengage the<br>
clutch 40. In addition, the actuation amount relational<br>
expression is established such that the command actuation<br>
amount increases in proportion to the torque deviation<br>
(Ttg - Tac).<br>
The storage unit 12 stores the actuation amount<br>
relational expressions; the one expression is to actuate<br>
the clutch actuator 14 in the direction to engage the<br>
clutch 40 when the torque deviation (Ttg - Tac) is<br>
50<br><br>
positive as shown in FIG. 16 (hereinafter the expression<br>
is referred to as engagement actuation amount relational<br>
expression) and the other expression is to actuate the<br>
clutch actuator 14 in the opposite direction from or the<br>
direction to disengage the clutch 40 (hereinafter the<br>
expression is referred to as disengagement actuation<br>
amount relational expression). FIG. 17 is a graph<br>
showing the relationship between the torque deviation<br>
(Ttg - Tac) and the command actuation amount obtained<br>
from the disengagement actuation amount relational<br>
expression. In the graph shown in FIG. 17, the actuation<br>
amount relational expression is established such that if<br>
the torque deviation (Ttg - Tac) is positive, the clutch<br>
actuator 14 is actuated in the direction to disengage the<br>
clutch 40, in contrast to the graph shown in FIG. 16.<br>
The clutch actuator control section llg selects<br>
either the engagement actuation amount relational<br>
expression or the disengagement actuation amount<br>
relational expression depending on a positive or negative<br>
value of the difference in clutch rotational speed<br>
(rotational speed of the drive-side member 41 - rotational<br>
speed of the driven-side member 42) . Specifically, if<br>
the difference in clutch rotational speed is positive,<br>
the clutch actuator control section llg assigns the<br>
torque deviation (Ttg - Tac) to the engagement actuation<br>
51<br><br>
amount relational expression. In contrast, if the<br>
difference in clutch rotational speed is negative, the<br>
clutch actuator control section llg assigns the torque<br>
deviation (Ttg - Tac) to the disengagement actuation<br>
amount relational expression.<br>
Alternatively, in place of the engagement actuation<br>
amount relational expression and the disengagement<br>
actuation amount relational expression, the storage unit<br>
12 may store a table that establishes the correspondence<br>
between the command actuation amount, and the target<br>
transmission torque Ttg and the actual transmission<br>
torque Tac. In this case, the clutch actuator control<br>
section llg refers to the table to directly obtain the<br>
command actuation amount that corresponds to the target<br>
transmission torque Ttg and the actual transmission<br>
torque Tac, rather than calculating the difference<br>
between the target transmission torque Ttg and the actual<br>
transmission torque Tac.<br>
When the difference in clutch rotational speed is<br>
below the rotational speed difference for discontinuing<br>
half-clutch as a result of the aforementioned control<br>
based on the torque deviation, the clutch actuator<br>
control section llg further actuates the clutch actuator<br>
14 to completely engage the clutch 40.<br>
Now, description is made of the processing executed<br>
52<br><br>
by the shift actuator control section llh. When the<br>
rider operates the shift-up switch 9a or the shift-down<br>
switch 9b to input a gear shift command from the switch<br>
button, the shift actuator control section llh actuates<br>
the shift actuator 16 to change the shift gears 53a, 53b,<br>
54a, 54b. In the example described herein, when the<br>
shift-up switch 9a or the shift-down switch 9b is turned<br>
ON, the shift actuator control section llh outputs a<br>
control signal to the shift actuator drive circuit 15 at<br>
start-up of the motorcycle 1 and in the state where the<br>
clutch 40 is disengaged and the gearbox 51 is set in the<br>
neutral position. The shift actuator 16 is actuated by<br>
the driving power supplied from the shift actuator drive<br>
circuit 15 in order to move some of the shift gears 53a,<br>
53b, 54a, 54b.<br>
Now, description is made of a flow of the<br>
processing executed by the control unit 11. FIG. 18 is a<br>
flowchart showing an example of the processing executed<br>
by the control unit 11 at start-up of the motorcycle 1.<br>
The processing described herein starts when the vehicle<br>
start-up conditions are satisfied. The vehicle start-up<br>
conditions are that: for example, the clutch 40 is<br>
disengaged with the gearbox 51 set in a position other<br>
than neutral position; and the engine speed and the<br>
accelerator displacement are equal to or greater than<br>
53<br><br>
their respective predetermined values. Alternatively,<br>
the start-up conditions may be that: the clutch 40 is<br>
disengaged with the gearbox 51 set in a position other<br>
than neutral position; and a value, which is obtained by<br>
subtracting the driven-side member 42 from the drive-side<br>
member 41 of the clutch 40, is a negative value.<br>
If the vehicle start-up conditions are satisfied,<br>
the request torque obtaining section lid first detects<br>
the accelerator displacement, and then refers to the<br>
request torque table (see FIG. 13) to obtain the request<br>
transmission torque Treq that corresponds to the detected<br>
accelerator displacement (step S101). In addition, the<br>
EG torque obtaining section 11a detects the engine speed<br>
and obtains the EG torque TEac based on the detected<br>
engine speed and accelerator displacement (step S102).<br>
After that, the range determining section lie<br>
estimates whether or not the EG torque TEac approximates<br>
the request transmission torque Treq in the case when the<br>
aforementioned request follow-up control is performed,<br>
and according to the estimation result, determines the<br>
current operation range of the engine 30 (steps S103 to<br>
S105). Specifically, the range determining section lie<br>
determines whether or not the engine speed increases in<br>
the case when the request follow-up control is performed<br>
(step S103). In other words, the range determining<br>
54<br><br>
section lie determines whether or not the difference<br>
between the EG torque TEac and the request transmission<br>
torque Treq (TEac - Treq) is greater than 0. In this<br>
step, if the difference is greater than 0, the range<br>
determining section lie determines that the engine speed<br>
increases and whether or not the request torque<br>
rotational speed Rreq is higher than the current engine<br>
speed (step S104). In this step, if the request torque<br>
rotational speed Rreq is higher than the current engine<br>
speed, the EG torque TEac should approximate the request<br>
transmission torque Treq due to the action of the<br>
aforementioned request follow-up control. Therefore, the<br>
range determining section lie determines that the engine<br>
30 operates currently in the torque-decreasing operation<br>
range. In this case, the processing of the control unit<br>
11 continues to the step S106. In contrast, in the step<br>
S104, if the request torque rotational speed Rreq is<br>
lower than the current engine speed, the EG torque TEac<br>
deviates from the request transmission torque Treq due to<br>
the action of the request follow-up control. Therefore,<br>
the range determining section lie determines that the<br>
engine 30 operates currently in the torque-increasing<br>
operation range. In this case, the processing of the<br>
control unit 11 continues to the step S107.<br>
In addition, in the step S103, if the engine speed<br>
55<br><br>
is determined to decrease in the case when the request<br>
follow-up control is performed (if the difference (TEac -<br>
Treq) is smaller than 0), the range determining section<br>
lie determines whether or not the request torque<br>
rotational speed Rreq is lower than the current engine<br>
speed (step S105) . In this step, if the request torque<br>
rotational speed Rreq is lower than the current engine<br>
speed, the EG torque TEac should naturally approximate<br>
the request transmission torque Treq due to the action of<br>
the request follow-up control. Therefore, the range<br>
determining section lie determines that the engine 30<br>
operates currently in the torque-decreasing operation<br>
range. Also in this case, the control unit 11 goes to<br>
the step S106 to continue the processing. In contrast,<br>
in the step S105, if the request torque rotational speed<br>
Rreq is determined to be higher than the current engine<br>
speed, the EG torque TEac deviates from the request<br>
transmission torque Treq due to the action of the request<br>
follow-up control. Therefore, the range determining<br>
section lie determines that the engine 30 operates in the<br>
torque-increasing operation range. In this case, the<br>
control unit 11 goes to the step S107 to continue the<br>
processing.<br>
As a result of the determinations of the processing<br>
steps S104 and S105, if the range determining section lie<br>
56<br><br>
determines that the current operating condition of the<br>
engine 30 falls within the torque-decreasing operation<br>
range, the target torque setting section llf sets the<br>
target transmission torque Ttg as the request<br>
transmission torque Treq obtained in the step S101 (step<br>
S106) . Thereby, the request follow-up control is<br>
performed under which the actual transmission torque Tac<br>
follows the request transmission torque Treq.<br>
In contrast, if the range determining section lie<br>
in the processing steps S104 and S105 determines that the<br>
current operating condition of the engine 30 falls within<br>
the torque-increasing operation range, the target torque<br>
setting section llf determines whether or not the EG<br>
torque TEac obtained in the step S102 is higher than the<br>
request transmission torque Treq obtained in the step<br>
S101 (step S107). In this step, if the EG torque TEac is<br>
higher than the request transmission torque Treq, the<br>
target torque setting section llf sets the target<br>
transmission torque Ttg as the EG torque TEac obtained in<br>
the step S102 (step S108). Thereby, the rotational speed<br>
maintaining control is performed in which the actual<br>
transmission torque Tac follows the EG torque TEac.<br>
In contrast, if the EG torque TEac is not higher than<br>
the request transmission torque Treq in the processing<br>
step S107, the target torque setting section llf executes<br>
57<br><br>
the following processing, for example, in order to<br>
perform the rotational speed induction control. More<br>
specifically, the target torque setting section llf<br>
determines whether or not the difference between the EG<br>
torque TEac and the request transmission torque Treq<br>
(Treq - TEac) is higher than the aforementioned maximum<br>
value ATmax (step S109) . In this step, if the difference<br>
(Treq - TEac) is larger than the maximum value ATmax, the<br>
target torque setting section llf subtracts the maximum<br>
value ATmax from the EG torque TEac and sets the obtained<br>
value as the target transmission torque Ttg (TEac<br>
ATmax) (step Sill). In contrast, if the difference (Treq<br>
- TEac) is not larger than the maximum value ATmax, the<br>
target torque setting section llf assigns the EG torque<br>
TEac, which is obtained in the step S102, and the request<br>
transmission torque Treq, which is obtained in the step<br>
S101, to the aforementioned expression (2) in order to<br>
calculate the target transmission torque Ttg (step S110).<br>
When the target transmission torque Ttg is set in<br>
the processing step S106, S108, S110 or Sill, the actual<br>
transmission torque obtaining section lib calculates the<br>
actual transmission torque Tac (step S112). Then, the<br>
clutch actuator control section llg determines whether or<br>
not the clutch rotational speed difference is a positive<br>
value, based on the determination result, selects either<br>
58<br><br>
then the aforementioned engagement actuation amount<br>
relational expression or disengagement actuation amount<br>
relational expression (step S113). Then, the clutch<br>
actuator control section llg calculates the command<br>
actuation amount based on the difference between the<br>
target transmission torque Ttg and the actual<br>
transmission torque Tac (that is, the torque deviation)<br>
(step S114). Specifically, if the clutch rotational<br>
speed difference is negative, the clutch actuator control<br>
section llg assigns the torque deviation (Ttg - Tac) to<br>
the disengagement actuation amount relational expression<br>
in order to calculate the command actuation amount. In<br>
contrast, if the clutch rotational speed difference is<br>
positive, the clutch actuator control section llg assigns<br>
the torque deviation to the engagement actuation amount<br>
relational expression in order to calculate the command<br>
actuation amount. Then, the clutch actuator control<br>
section llg outputs a control signal to the clutch<br>
actuator drive circuit 13 according to the command<br>
actuation amount (step S115). Thereby, the clutch<br>
actuator 14 is actuated for the amount according to the<br>
command actuation amount, so that the degree of<br>
engagement of the clutch 40 changes.<br>
After that, the clutch actuator control section llg<br>
recalculates the clutch rotational speed difference, and<br>
59<br><br>
determines whether or not the recalculated clutch<br>
rotational speed difference is smaller than the<br>
rotational speed difference for discontinuing half-clutch<br>
(step S116) . In this step, if the clutch rotational<br>
speed difference is smaller than the rotational speed<br>
difference for discontinuing half-clutch, the clutch<br>
actuator control section llg allows the clutch 40 to be<br>
completely engaged (step S117). In contrast, if the<br>
clutch rotational speed difference has not been smaller<br>
than the rotational speed difference for discontinuing<br>
half-clutch, the control unit 11 returns to the step S101<br>
to repeat the subsequent steps in a predetermined cycle<br>
(for example, several milliseconds) until the clutch 40<br>
is completely engaged in the step S117. The<br>
aforementioned processing is an example of the processing<br>
executed by the control unit 11 at vehicle start-up.<br>
Under the request follow-up control of the above-<br>
mentioned clutch controller 10, the control unit 11<br>
actuates the clutch actuator 14 based on the difference<br>
between the actual transmission torque Tac and the<br>
request transmission torque Treq, such that Tac<br>
approximates Treq. This allows appropriate torque to be<br>
transmitted to the downstream side via the clutch 40<br>
during engaging operation of the clutch 40. In addition,<br>
if the engine 30 operates in a predetermined operation<br>
60<br><br>
range (the torque-increasing operation range in the above<br>
description), the control unit 11 performs the rotational<br>
speed maintaining control and makes the clutch actuator<br>
14 actuate such that the actual transmission torque Tac<br>
approximates the EG torque TEac. This prevents the<br>
engine speed from excessive increase or decrease.<br>
Further, in the clutch controller 10, the actual<br>
torque obtaining section lib calculates the actual<br>
transmission torque Tac based on the EG torque TEac and<br>
the inertia torque TIac generated by the inertia of the<br>
mechanism (such as the crankshaft 34, the piston 32 the<br>
primary deceleration mechanism 36, and the like in the<br>
above description) located upstream of the drive-side<br>
member 41 in the torque transmission path. The actual<br>
transmission torque Tac is thus obtained without<br>
providing any specific sensor for outputting an electric<br>
signal according to the actual transmission torque Tac.<br>
Still further, in the clutch controller 10, the<br>
control unit 11 performs the rotational speed maintaining<br>
control in place of the request follow-up control, if the<br>
engine 30 operates in the operation range in which the EG<br>
torque TEac increases along with the increase in the<br>
engine speed (that is, the torque-increasing operation<br>
range) . This suppresses of the engine speed the<br>
excessive increase or decrease when the engine 30<br>
61<br><br>
operates in the torque-increasing operation range.<br>
Still further, in the clutch controller 10, under<br>
the rotational speed maintaining control, the control<br>
unit 11 actuates the clutch actuator 14 based on the<br>
difference between the actual transmission torque Tac and<br>
the EG torque TEac, such that Tac approximates TEac. As<br>
described above, under the request follow-up control, the<br>
control unit 11 actuates the clutch actuator 14 based on<br>
the difference between the actual transmission torque Tac<br>
and the request transmission torque Treq. Therefore,<br>
under the rotational speed maintaining control, by<br>
actuating the clutch actuator 14 based on the difference<br>
between the actual transmission torque Tac and the EG<br>
torque Teac, it is possible to approximate the processing<br>
of the request follow-up control and of the rotational<br>
speed maintaining control, and thus to simplify the<br>
processing for controlling the clutch.<br>
Still further, in the clutch controller 10, the<br>
control unit 11 includes the target torque setting<br>
section llf for setting the torque that is supposed to be<br>
transmitted from the drive-side member 41 to the driven-<br>
side member 42 or the mechanism located downstream of the<br>
driven-side member 42 as the target transmission torque<br>
Ttg. Then, the control unit 11 actuates the clutch<br>
actuator 14 according to the difference between the<br>
62<br><br>
target transmission torque Ttg and the actual<br>
transmission torque Tac. Further, the target torque<br>
setting section llf sets the target transmission torque<br>
Ttg at the request transmission torque Treq under the<br>
request follow-up control, while setting the target<br>
transmission torque Ttg at the EG torque TEac under the<br>
rotational speed maintaining control. In this manner, by<br>
selectively setting the request transmission torque Treq<br>
and the EG torque Teac setting to the target transmission<br>
torque Ttg, it is possible to switch between the request<br>
follow-up control and the rotational speed maintaining<br>
control, and thus, to simplify the processing for<br>
controlling the clutch.<br>
The present invention is not limited to the above-<br>
mentioned clutch controller 10 and can have various<br>
alternatives. For example, in the above description, if<br>
the current operating condition of the engine 30 falls<br>
within the torque-increasing operation range, and the<br>
detected EG torque TEac is higher than the request<br>
transmission torque Treq, the control unit 11 performs<br>
the rotational speed maintaining control in which the<br>
target transmission torque Ttg is set at the detected EG<br>
torque TEac. However, if the current operating condition<br>
of the engine 30 falls within the torque-increasing<br>
operation range, and the engine speed falls outside a<br>
63<br><br>
predetermined range, the target torque setting section<br>
llf may perform the rotational speed maintaining control.<br>
In addition, the target torque setting section llf may<br>
set the target transmission torque Ttg by means of the<br>
similar processing under the aforementioned rotational<br>
speed induction control, unless the engine speed falls<br>
outside the predetermined range.<br>
FIG. 19 is a flowchart showing an example of the<br>
processing executed by the control unit 11 according to<br>
the embodiment of the invention. In FIG. 19, the same<br>
processing steps as those shown in FIG. 18 are designated<br>
by the same numerals, and the description thereof is not<br>
repeated.<br>
In this embodiment, as shown in FIG. 19, if the<br>
determination results in the steps S103 to S105 show that<br>
the current operating condition of the engine 30 falls<br>
within the torque-increasing operation range, the target<br>
torque setting section llf calculates the engine speed<br>
Rac based on the signal of the engine speed detector 18.<br>
Then, the target torque setting section llf determines<br>
whether or not the calculated engine speed Rac is higher<br>
than a predetermined minimum value Rmin and also is lower<br>
than a predetermined maximum value Rmax (step S118). In<br>
this step, the minimum value Rmin and the maximum value<br>
Rmax are referred to as engine speed in the torque-<br>
64<br><br>
increasing operation range and are stored in the storage<br>
unit 12 in advance.<br>
If the determination result in the step S118 shows<br>
that the engine speed is either equal to or higher than<br>
the maximum value Rmax or equal to or lower than the<br>
minimum value Rmin, the target torque setting section llf<br>
sets the target transmission torque Ttg at the EG torque<br>
TEac (step S108). Thereby, the rotational speed<br>
maintaining control is performed. In contrast, if the<br>
engine speed Rac is higher than the minimum value Rmin<br>
and lower than the maximum value Rmax, the target torque<br>
setting section llf determines whether or not the<br>
difference between the EG torque TEac and the request<br>
transmission torque Treq (Treq - TEac) is larger than the<br>
aforementioned maximum value ATmax (step S109), and then<br>
performs the subsequent process. Thereby, the rotational<br>
speed induction control is performed.<br>
In this embodiment, the request follow-up control<br>
is replaced with the rotational speed maintaining control,<br>
if the engine 30 operates in an operation range in which<br>
the engine speed exceeds a predetermined value (the<br>
maximum value Rmax or the minimum value Rmin). This also<br>
makes it possible to prevent the engine speed from<br>
excessively increasing or decreasing even when the engine<br>
30 operates in the torque-increasing operation range.<br>
65<br><br>
In turn, if the current operating condition of the<br>
engine 30 falls within the torque-decreasing operation<br>
range, and the engine speed exceeds a predetermined<br>
maximum value Rmax2 or a predetermined minimum value<br>
Rmin2, the control unit 11 may perform the rotational<br>
speed maintaining control. This prevents the engine<br>
speed from excessively increasing or decreasing during<br>
engaging operation of the clutch 40, even if the current<br>
operating condition of the engine 30 falls within the<br>
torque-decreasing operation range.<br>
In addition, under the above-mentioned rotational<br>
speed induction control, the target torque setting<br>
section llf controls the clutch actuator 14 by setting<br>
the target transmission torque Ttg in accordance with the<br>
request transmission torque Treq in order for the engine<br>
speed to reach the request torque rotational speed Rreq.<br>
In other words, the target torque setting section llf<br>
assigns the request transmission torque Treq and the EG<br>
torque TEac to the aforementioned expression (2) in order<br>
to calculate the target transmission torque Ttg. However,<br>
under the rotational speed induction control, the target<br>
torque setting section llf may set the target<br>
transmission torque Ttg according to a predetermined<br>
value (hereinafter referred to as fixed transmission<br>
torque) in place of the request transmission torque Treq.<br>
66<br><br>
For example, the target torque setting section llf may-<br>
assign the fixed transmission torque, in place of the<br>
request transmission torque Treq, to the aforementioned<br>
expression (2) in order to calculate the target<br>
transmission torque Ttg. This allows the control unit 11<br>
to actuate the clutch actuator 14 such that the engine<br>
speed approximates at which the EG torque TEac equal to<br>
the fixed transmission torque is outputted.<br>
In addition, under the above-mentioned rotational<br>
speed maintaining control, the control unit 11 sets the<br>
target transmission torque Ttg at the EG torque TEac, and<br>
actuates the clutch actuator 14 according to the<br>
difference between the target transmission torque Ttg and<br>
the actual transmission torque Tac, thereby suppressing<br>
the changes in engine speed. However, the control unit<br>
11 may perform the rotational speed maintaining control<br>
based on the engine speed rather than that based on the<br>
above torque difference. Such control is executed as<br>
follows, for example.<br>
The storage unit 12 stores in advance a table that<br>
establishes the correspondence between the command<br>
actuation amount of the clutch actuator 14, and the rate-<br>
of-change of engine speed Q e (the rate-of-change of EG<br>
speed (d Q e / dt)) and the clutch rotational speed<br>
difference. For example, this table is established such<br>
67<br><br>
that as the rate-of-change of EG speed (d Q e / dt)<br>
increases, the command actuation amount increases. For<br>
example, this table is also established such that as the<br>
clutch rotational speed difference increases, the command<br>
actuation amount decreases. In the case where the<br>
storage unit 12 stores such a table, during engaging<br>
operation of the clutch 40, the control unit 11<br>
calculates the rate-of-change of EG speed (dQe / dt) in a<br>
predetermined cycle based on the signal inputted from the<br>
engine speed detector 18, while calculating the clutch<br>
rotational speed difference based on the signals inputted<br>
from the clutch rotational speed detectors 23a, 23b.<br>
Then, the control unit 11 refers to the aforementioned<br>
table to obtain the command actuation amount that<br>
corresponds to the calculated rate-of-change of EG speed<br>
(d Q e / dt) and clutch rotational speed difference, and<br>
outputs a control signal to the clutch actuator 14<br>
according to the obtained command actuation amount. Due<br>
to the execution of such rotational speed maintaining<br>
control, the rate-of-change of EG speed (d Q e / dt)<br>
gradually decreases during the engaging operation of the<br>
clutch 40, and consequently, the actual transmission<br>
torque Tac approximates the EG torque TEac. Thus, the<br>
engine speed is prevented from excessively increasing or<br>
decreasing.<br>
68<br><br>
In turn, the control unit 11 may perform the<br>
rotational speed induction control based on the engine<br>
speed, rather than that based on the torque difference.<br>
Such control is executed as follows, for example.<br>
The storage unit 12 stores in advance a table that<br>
establishes the correspondence between the command<br>
actuation amount, and the clutch rotational speed<br>
difference and the rate-of-change of the difference (Rreq<br>
- Q e) between the request torque rotational speed Rreq<br>
and the current engine speed Q e (d (Rreq - Q e) / dt) .<br>
For example, this table is established such that as the<br>
rate-of-change (d (Rreq Q e) / dt) increases, the<br>
command actuation amount increases. For example, this<br>
table is also established such that as the clutch<br>
rotational speed difference increases, the command<br>
actuation amount decreases. In the case when the storage<br>
unit 12 stores such a table, the control unit 11 obtains<br>
the request transmission torque Treq during the engaging<br>
operation of the clutch and refers to the aforementioned<br>
EG torque table to obtain the request torque rotational<br>
speed Rreq that corresponds to the obtained request<br>
transmission torque Treq. Then, the control unit 11<br>
obtains the engine speed Qe based on the signal inputted<br>
from the engine speed detector 18 and calculates the<br>
rate-of-change (d (Rreq - Qe) / dt). The control unit 11<br>
69<br><br>
also calculates the clutch rotational speed difference<br>
based on the signals inputted from the clutch rotational<br>
speed detectors 23a, 23b. Then, referring to the<br>
aforementioned command actuation amount correspondence<br>
table, the control unit 11 obtains the command actuation<br>
amount that corresponds to the rate-of-change (d (Rreq -<br>
Qe) / dt) and the clutch rotational speed difference, and<br>
outputs a control signal to the clutch actuator 14<br>
according to the obtained command actuation amount. Due<br>
to the execution of such rotational speed induction<br>
control, the engine speed increases or decreases to the<br>
request torque rotational speed Rreq determined according<br>
toward the request transmission torque Treq, thereby<br>
preventing the engine speed from excessively increasing<br>
or decreasing.<br>
