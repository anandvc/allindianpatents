The main usage of the silicon carbide - mullite - alumina nanocomposites is in the field of machines with static and moving parts where the atmosphere is oxidising or neutral and where the operation take places at room temperature, below room temperature and elevated temperature upto 1800°C. The component may act as component of a machine, as nozzle or in any shape as may be deemed fit. The said article may also be used as special refractory material where thermal shock, abrasion, erosion, oxidative corrosion etc. are to be countered at room temperature, below room temperature and at elevated temperature upto 1800°C. The present day methods of making silicon carbide base nanocomposites consists of mixing silicon carbide powder along with different metal and/or metal oxide powders in acetone medium followed by sieving, pressing and firing in inert atmosphere by using HIPing at the temperature in the range of 1700 - 1850°C references for which are made to "Effect of milling conditions on the strength of Alumina - Silicon Carbide Nanocomposites", Jeong, Y.

stage may be such as Ar, He.<br>
The details of the process of the present invention are given below :<br>
a)	Silicon carbide powder is mixed with dispersing agents and water by constant stirring.<br>
b)	Soluble aluminium salt solution is added in the silicon carbide slip prepared in step 'a' .<br>
c)	The entire mixture is stirred for 3 - 5 hrs.<br>
d)	Ammonium hydroxide solution is slowly added or ammonia is passed in the mixture<br>
produced by step 'a' - c' till pH is 10.5 -11.5.<br>
e)	The entire mass converts to a semisolid gel like mass which is allowed to age for 24 - 48 hrs.<br>
f)	Product formed in step 'e' is filtered and washed by warm water.<br>
g)	The washed material is dried at 110 + 5 C for 24 hrs.<br>

environment.<br>
i)  The heat treated product is ground and sieved through 100 mesh.<br>
j)    The sieved powder is formed into green shape by slip casting or uniaxial pressing or cold<br>

k) The green pressed product is fired in air environment at 1200 - 1400°C for 2 -10 hrs.<br>
1) The product obtained in step 'k' is sintered at temperature in the range of 1600 - 1750°C in AT<br>
or He atmosphere for a period in the range of 0.5 to 4 hrs.<br>
The process of the present invention can be used to produce sintered silicon carbide - mullite -alumina nanocomposite of various green shapes and sizes required for application as engineering and refractory material. Silicon carbide particles are always associated with a surface layer of silica which forms highly reactive silicic acid in the aqueous suspension state. Soluble aluminium salt mixed thoroughly with the silicon carbide suspension, will be homogeneously distributed throughout the entire suspending mass. Ammonia solution will convert aluminium nitrate into aluminium hydroxide hydrogel that will remain intimately in contact with silicic acid perhaps forming alumino silicate hydrogel rich in aluminium. On drying, the gel like mass will form an uniform layer of alumino silicate gel over the surface of the silicon carbide grains. Due to extremely high reactivity, this will form mullite and reactive alumina. This reactive alumina will combine with freshly formed silica during firing again forming mullite as the silica alumina system is in the alumina rich region. Through this process particle size of SiC will be progressively reduced to lower sizes which will be embedded in oxide matrix of mullite and alumina.<br>
