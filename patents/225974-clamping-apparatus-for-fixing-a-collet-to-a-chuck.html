				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention refers to a clamping apparatus for fixing<br>
a collet member to a chuck member.<br>
With the expression "Collet Member", in the present context, a<br>
slotted clamping sleeve member is understood, having a conical<br>
portion, which is adapted to clamp an object, particularly a work<br>
piece to be machined, by radially forcing out or forcing in the<br>
clamping jaws of the collet member. Such collet members are used,<br>
for instance, with turning lathes where they have a female thread<br>
to be screwed onto a threaded spindle of the lathe.<br>
A fundamental disadvantage of known conventional collet members<br>
consists in the fact that both their angular position around<br>
the rotational axis, i.e. the central longitudinal or Z-axis, as<br>
well as their position in the direction of the extension of the Z-<br>
axis is not or, at least, not exactly defined with regard to the<br>
position of the spindle. In machining axially symmetrical work<br>
pieces in a lathe, the afore mentioned disadvantage is of secondary<br>
importance. However, more and more often the need arises to<br>
clamp work pieces to machine tools other than lathes that are not<br>
axially symmetrical by means of collet members; in this case, the<br>
exact definition of the position of the work piece not only in X-<br>
and Z-direction, but also in Z-direction, i.e. along the extension<br>
of the central longitudinal axis, as well as with regard to their<br>
angular orientation around the Z-axis is highly desirable.<br>
Hitherto, in order to use collet members in a positionally<br>
well defined manner, i.e. both in X- and Y-directions as well as<br>
in Z-direction and regarding the angular orientation around the Z-<br>
axis, intermediate pallet members had to be used to which the collet<br>
member is fixed and which are provided with positioning or<br>
centering elements. That pallet member, then, can be attached to a<br>
corresponding chuck member provided with positioning or centering<br><br>
elements cooperating with,the elements of the intermediate pallet<br>
member.<br>
The patent publication FR-A-2,694,222 discloses a tool drill<br>
chuck, comprising a tool holding member, preferably in the shape<br>
of a tubular sleeve member, a disc-shaped member that can be connected<br>
to the tool holding member, and a device adapted to be rotated<br>
by a machine to rotate the afore mentioned disc-shaped member.<br>
Thereby, the tool holding member, designed as a hollow rotational<br>
element with a closed end and engaging the disc-shaped member,<br>
comprises two axially aligned portions, one of which serving<br>
for receiving a drill bit and the other one serving for receiving<br>
a tap for cutting a thread in a bore created by the afore mentioned<br>
drill bit. This publication does not disclose an informative<br>
basis for an exact positioning of a work piece in X- and Y-<br>
directions. Neither are any suggestions disclosed for realizing an<br>
exact positioning of the work piece in Z-direction.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a clamping<br>
apparatus for fixing a collet member to a chuck member directly,<br>
easily, quickly and in a well defined position in X-, Y- and Z-di-<br>
rections as well as regarding its angular orientation around the<br>
Z-axis.<br>
This and other objects are met with a clamping apparatus, comprising<br>
a chuck member having clamping means adapted to clampingly<br>
fix a collet member, and a collet member adapted to be fixed to<br>
the chuck member and having first centering means for aligning the<br>
position of the collet member with regard to the chuck member.<br>
The chuck member is provided with second centering means for<br>
aligning the position of the collet member with regard to the<br>
chuck member and cooperating with the first centering means of the<br>
collet member.<br>
The first centering means of the collet member comprises a<br>
plurality of first centering elements located at the rear side of<br>
the collet member facing the chuck member, and the second centering<br>
means of the chuck member comprises a plurality of second centering<br>
elements corresponding to the plurality of first centering<br><br>
elements of the collet member regarding size and location. The<br>
second centering elements are adapted to engage the first centering<br>
elements of the collet member upon fixing the collet member to<br>
the chuck member to align the collet member with regard to the<br>
chuck member at least in X- and Y-directions.<br>
The collet member is provided with a thrust surface adapted to<br>
be engaged by the clamping means of the chuck member to clampingly<br>
fix the collet member to the chuck member, or the collet member<br>
comprises a clamping stud provided with a thrust surface adapted<br>
to be engaged by the clamping means of the chuck member to clampingly<br>
fix the collet member to the chuck member.<br>
In the following, embodiments of the clamping apparatus according<br>
to the invention will be further described, with reference<br>
to the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
Fig. 1 shows an exploded view of a clamping apparatus comprising<br>
a chuck member and a collet member;<br>
Fig. 2 shows a perspective bottom view of the collet member;<br>
Fig. 3 shows a partially longitudinally sectioned view of the<br>
chuck member and the collet member attached thereto;<br>
Fig. 4 shows a perspective view of another embodiment of the<br>
clamping apparatus;<br>
Fig. 5 shows a longitudinal sectional view of the clamping apparatus<br>
according to Fig. 4; and<br>
Fig. 6 shows a collet member provided with a clamping stud.<br>
Fig. 1 shows an exploded view of a clamping apparatus 10, comprising<br>
a chuck member 1, a collet member 2 adapted to be clampingly<br>
fixed to the chuck member 1, and an actuating bolt 3. The Z-<br>
axis of the apparatus, simultaneously constituting the longitudinal<br>
central axis, is designated by reference numeral 46. Even if<br>
the actuating bolt 3 is shown in Fig. 1 separately, normally it<br>
constitutes an inherent part of the chuck member 1.<br>
The chuck member 1 is provided with an annular protrusion 11.<br>
On the top front face of the protrusion 11, four centering cams<br>
12a, 12b, 12c and 12d are located. The four centering cams 12a,<br>
12b, 12c and 12d are evenly distributed along the circumference of<br><br>
the top front face of the protrusion 11. A first Z-axis rest surface<br>
13a is located between the centering cams 12a and 12b, a second<br>
Z-axis rest surface 13b is located between the centering cams<br>
12b and 12c, a third Z-axis rest surface 13c is located between<br>
the centering cams 12c and 12d, and a fourth Z-axis rest surface<br>
13d is located between the centering cams 12d and 12a. All four Z-<br>
axis rest surfaces 13a, 13b, 13c and 13d are somewhat elevated<br>
above the top front face of the protrusion 11. In the center of<br>
the Z-axis rest surface 13b, an indexing pin 14 is provided, towering<br>
above the rest surface 13b.<br>
The protrusion 11 is surrounded by an annular ball retainer<br>
16,	adapted to receive a plurality of clamping balls 17 distributed<br>
along an annulus and provided with an external male screw<br>
thread. The clamping balls 17 are received in bores 18 of the ball<br>
retainer 16. Screwed onto the outer male screw thread of the annular<br>
ball retainer 16 is a union nut 19, having an inner conical<br>
thrust surface 20 adapted to radially displace the clamping balls<br>
17.	The top of the union nut 19 is provided with a sealing lip 8,<br>
resting against the outside of the ball retainer 16. The ball retainer<br>
is attached to a base plate 21 by means of screws 15. The<br>
base plate 21 itself is provided with fixing means (not shown) to<br>
be attached to a suitably designed retainer means to be provided<br>
on the machine tool to which the clamping apparatus 10 is to be<br>
attached.<br>
The actuating bolt 3 is to be located in the interior of the<br>
chuck member 1 and is axially movable, i.e. in Z-direction along<br>
the axis 46. The displacement of the actuating bolt 3 is performed<br>
preferably pneumatically. The front portion of the actuating bolt<br>
3 is provided with a conical thrust surface 4, adapted to radially<br>
expand the collet member 2, as will be explained in more detail<br>
herein after..<br>
The collet member 2, shown in Fig. 1 in a partially sectioned<br>
view, has essentially a hollow cylindrical shape. The front portion<br>
23 of the collet member 2 is provided with slots 25a, 25b,<br>
dividing the front portion 23 of the collet member 2 into radially<br><br>
expandable and compressible clamping jaws 24a, 24b, 24c and 24d.<br>
Thus, the collet member 2 of this embodiment comprises a total of<br>
four slots and four clamping jaws. It is understood that the collet<br>
member 2 could be provided with fewer, for example three, or<br>
with more, for example six or eight, clamping jaws. The front portion<br>
23 of the collet member 2 is provided with a central bore 26,<br>
the diameter thereof corresponding to the diameter of the shaft of<br>
the tool to be used with the particular collet member 2.<br>
The back side of the collet member 2 is provided with an annular<br>
shoulder 28, having an annular front face 31 at its bottom.<br>
The annular front face 31 constitutes the Z-axis stop member when<br>
the collet member 2 is attached to the chuck member 1. The top<br>
side of the shoulder 28 is provided with an oblique thrust surface<br>
29. The collet member 2 having been inserted into the chuck member<br>
1, the clamping balls 17 engage the oblique thrust surface 29 to<br>
fix the collet member 2 to the chuck member 1.<br>
The lower front face 31 of the collet member 2 is provided<br>
with centering grooves 30a, 30b, corresponding to the centering<br>
cams 12a, 12b, 12c, 12c as far as position and shape is concerned,<br>
and serving for positioning the collet member 2 with regard to the<br>
chuck member 1 both in X- and in Y-direction as well as regarding<br>
the angular position around the Z-axis. It is to be noted that the<br>
collet member 2 is provided with a total of four centering grooves<br>
30; however, in the illustration of Fig. 1, only two of them, i.e.<br>
the grooves 30a and 30b are visible. Moreover, the annular front<br>
face 31 of the collet member 2 is provided with a indexing aperture,<br>
also not visible in Fig. 1, adapted to receive the indexing<br>
pin 14 provided on the chuck member 1. A shaft portion 32 constitutes<br>
the central portion of the collet member 2 and connects the<br>
front portion 23 of the collet member 2 with the shoulder 28.<br>
The front portion 23 of the collet member 2 is provided with a<br>
conically narrowing recess 34 located at its back side. This recess<br>
34 extends within the shaft portion 32 from the back side of<br>
the front portion 23 of the collet member 2 to the bore 26. The<br>
recess 34 is delimited by protruding, conically widening wall por-<br><br>
tions 35a, 35b. The wall portions 35a and 35b are subdivided by<br>
the slots 25a, 25b in the front portion 23 of the collet member 2.<br>
Thus, a total of four wall portions are present, separated from<br>
each other by the afore mentioned slots 25a, 25b. As soon as the<br>
actuating bolt 3 is pushed into the recess 34, the clamp jaws 24a,<br>
24b, 24c (and also the forth clamp jaw not shown in Fig. 1) are<br>
radially forced apart.<br>
It is understood that the configuration of the centering<br>
grooves and centering cams could be inverted, in other words, the<br>
centering cams could be provided on the collet member 2 and the<br>
centering grooves on the chuck member 1.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a perspective view of the collet member 2 from<br>
the bottom. In this illustration, it is particularly shown that<br>
the four centering grooves 30a, 30b, 30c, 30d are machined into<br>
that front surface 31 of the shoulder 28 that is remote from the<br>
front portion 23 of the collet member 2, and that the shoulder 28<br>
is provided with a thrust surface 29 adapted to engage the clamping<br>
balls 17 of the chuck member 1. Moreover, the indexing aperture<br>
33 adapted to receive the indexing pin 14 is clearly visible,<br>
the cooperation of the indexing pin 14 and the indexing aperture<br>
33 permitting an approximate definition of the position of the<br>
collet member 2 around the Z-axis and ensuring a correct attachment<br>
of the collet member 2 to the chuck member 1 as far as the<br>
approximate angular position around the Z-axis is concerned.<br>
The annular surface portions of the rear front face 31 of the<br>
collet member 2, located between the centering grooves 30a, 30b,<br>
30c, 30d, constitute the Z-reference surface of the collet member<br>
2 upon clamping the collet member 2 to the chuck member 1. Due to<br>
the fact that the centering grooves 30a, 30b, 30c, 30d are machined<br>
into the shoulder 28 of the collet member 2 in the region<br>
of the thrust surface 29, as seen in axial direction, and also due<br>
to the fact that the collet member 2 is fixed in Z-direction at<br>
this thrust surface 29 by means of a plurality of clamping balls<br>
17 arranged along an annulus, the collet member 2 can be fixed to<br>
the chuck member 1 in a very well defined position regarding all<br><br>
three axes and the angular orientation, and it can accept very<br>
high forces, particularly also in radial direction.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a partially longitudinally sectioned view of the<br>
chuck member 1 and the collet member 2 attached thereto. The collet<br>
member 2 is fixed to the chuck member 1 by means of the clamping<br>
balls 17 engaging the thrust surface 29 provided on the shoulder<br>
28. The clamping balls 17 are pressed radially inwards by the<br>
thrust surface 20 of the union nut 19, the latter one having been<br>
manually rotated into its operating position as shown on Fig. 3.<br>
Due to the fact that the clamping balls 17 are pushed against the<br>
thrust surface 29 of the shoulder 28 of the collet member 2, the<br>
collet member 2 is pressed against the chuck member 1 in Z-direction.<br>
The actuating bolt 3 provided for radially forcing apart the<br>
clamping jaws 24 of the collet member 2 is shown in Fig. 3 in its<br>
upper operating position. When the actuating bolt 3 is pushed upwards,<br>
its conical thrust surface 4 engages the wall portion of<br>
the recess 34 and the conically widening wall portions 35a, 25b,<br>
respectively,, with the result that the clamping jaws 24a, 24b, 24c<br>
(and also 24d, not shown in Fig. 3) of the collet member 2 are<br>
forced apart in radial direction.<br>
Such a clamping apparatus 10 is particularly suitable for fixing<br>
work pieces or tools that are attached to the collet member 2<br>
by radially forcing apart the clamping jaws thereof. The hollow<br>
work piece to be attached to the collet member 2 (not shown) is<br>
pushed over the collet member 2 such that it is fixed along the<br>
circumference of the collet member 2 by radially forcing the<br>
clamping jaws apart. Thereby, the outline of the collet member 2<br>
is preferably adapted to match the inner contour of a recess in<br>
the work piece to be fixed to the chuck member 1. Another possibility<br>
is to provide an adapter that can be attached to the work<br>
piece and that has a hollow portion matching the outline of the<br>
collet member 2; it is also possible to match the work piece itself<br>
to the outline of the collet member 2.<br>
As long as the actuating bolt 3 is pushed into the recess 34<br>
of the collet member 2, the work piece is fixed to the collet mem-<br><br>
ber 2. The actuating bolt 3 having been pulled back, the work<br>
piece can be removed from the collet member 2, because the clamping<br>
jaws 24 resiliently return into their unloaded initial position.<br>
Basically, it is true that the four centering cams 12a, 12b,<br>
12c, 12d of the chuck member 1 enter the four centering grooves<br>
30a, 30b, 30c, 30d of the collet member 2 upon attaching the collet<br>
member 2 to the chuck member 1. Thereby, the collet member 2<br>
is positioned with regard to the chuck member 1 in X- and Y-directions<br>
as well as regarding its angular orientation around the Z-<br>
axis. The centering grooves 30a, 30b, 30c, 30d of the collet member<br>
2 are dimensioned and adapted to the size of the centering<br>
cams 12a, 12b, 12c, 12d of the chuck member 1 such that the centering<br>
cams 12a, 12b, 12c, 12d of the chuck member 1 enter the<br>
centering grooves 30a, 30b, 30c, 30d of the collet member 2 that<br>
far, the collet member 2 being loosely put onto the chuck member<br>
1, that a gap with a width in the range of 0.01 to 0.1 mm remains<br>
between the Z-axis rest surfaces 13a, 13b, 13c, 13d of the chuck<br>
member 1 and the annular front face 31 of the collet member 2. Upon<br>
tightening the union nut 19, this gap disappears since the centering<br>
cams 12a, 12b, 12c, 12d of the chuck member 1 enter the<br>
centering grooves 30a, 30b, 30c, 30d of the collet member 2 deeper,<br>
i.e. by the amount of the width of the former gap. Thereby,<br>
advantage is taken of the inherent elasticity of the material,<br>
usually steel, insofar as the centering grooves 30a, 30b, 30c, 30d<br>
of the collet member 2 are somewhat widened. Such deformation occurs<br>
within the region of the elasticity of the material; the result<br>
is that centering elements can be avoided that are resiliently<br>
elastic in Z-direction. The union nut 19 having been tightened,<br>
the collet member 2 rests with its annular front face 31 on the<br>
rest surfaces 13a, 13b, 13c, 13d serving as Z-axis reference surfaces;<br>
thus, the position of the collet member 2 with regard to<br>
the chuck member 1 is exactly defined in Z-direction, too.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a perspective view of another embodiment of the<br>
clamping apparatus. The collet member 2a is provided with an oval<br><br>
recess 37 for fixing a corresponding work piece 39. The bottom 38<br>
of the recess 37 constitutes the Z-reference surface for the work<br>
piece 39. In this case, the work piece 37 is not fixed to the collet<br>
member 2a by radially forcing out the clamping jaws thereof,<br>
but by radially forcing in the latter ones. Such radial forcing in<br>
of the clamping jaws is effected by an actuating bolt 3a having a<br>
different design, as will be further explained herein after with<br>
reference to Fig. 5.<br>
Fiq. 5 shows a longitudinal sectional view of the clamping apparatus<br>
according to Fig. 4. Clearly visible is the actuating bolt<br>
3a. Instead of a conical thrust surface, the actuating bolt 3a is<br>
provided with a recess 36, the inside shape of which substantially<br>
corresponding to the outline of the wall portions 35a, 35b delimiting<br>
the recess 34 in the collet member 2a The inside of the recess<br>
36 of the actuating bolt 3a engages the outside of the conical<br>
wall portions 35a, 35b when the actuating bolt 3a is pushed<br>
upwards, with the result that the clamping jaws are forced inwards,<br>
thus clamping the work piece 39 in the collet member 2a.<br>
Fig. 6 shows another embodiment of a collet member 2. The collet<br>
member 2 is provided with a clamping stud 41, serving for<br>
pulling in and fixing the collet member 2 to the chuck member 1.<br>
The lower end of the clamping stud 41 is provided with a peripheral<br>
shoulder 42, having a beveled thrust surface 43 that can be engaged<br>
by the clamping balls 17 of the chuck member 1. It is understood<br>
that the chuck member 1 has to match a collet member 2 provided<br>
with a clamping bolt 41. Particularly, the clamping balls 17<br>
of the chuck member 1 have to be located further downwards.<br>
Preferably, the clamping bolt 41 is of hollow cylindrical shape;<br>
thereby it is possible to provide an actuating bolt extending<br>
through the clamping bolt 41 and serving for forcing apart or<br>
forcing in the clamping jaws.<br>
A collet member 2 designed along the lines of the present invention<br>
can be fixed to a chuck member 1 directly, simply, quickly<br>
and in a well defined position.<br><br>
The provision of a union nut 19 that has to be manually<br>
screwed on to fix the collet member 2 has the advantage that the<br>
clamping apparatus 10 is of a very compact design and can be manufactured<br>
in a cost effective manner. Instead of a manually applicable<br>
union nut for fixing the collet member, the chuck member 1<br>
could be provided with a spring-loaded, pneumatically or hydraulically<br>
displaceable clamping piston whose inside comprises a conically<br>
narrowing thrust surface for radially displacing the clamping<br>
balls. If a collet member without a clamping bolt is used, the<br>
entire clamping apparatus can be designed in a very compact manner .<br><br>
