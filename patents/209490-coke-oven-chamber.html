COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10]<br>
"COKE OVEN CHAMBER"<br>
DEUTSCHE MONTAN TECHNOLOGIE GMBH, of Am Technologiepark 1, 45307 Essen, Germany,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br><br>
Coke Oven Door with Gas Channel<br>
The invention relates to a coke oven chamber comprising at least one oven door and at least one gas channel comprising at least one external and at least one internal door sealing strip whereby said gas channel surrounds the oven door in an essentially comprehensive manner.<br>
In a coke oven chamber, the raw gas developing in the coal charge is under increased pressure, especially at the commencement of the coking process, since its escape through the high coal fill into the gas collecting space located above the fill is severely impeded. As a consequence, there is the risk that at the areas of the door seal, which cannot withstand the increased raw gas pressure in the coke oven chamber, the raw gas penetrates the door seal, thus resulting in emissions. During the coking process, the raw gas generation decreases and therefore also the emission behaviour. Towards the end of the coking process, an underpresssure results in the lower coke oven region due to the decreasing raw gas generation in the coke oven chamber. This leads to the likely risk of external air being sucked into the coke oven chamber which can result in damaging the oven.<br>
Numerous variations of coke oven doors are known which are intended to reliably achieve a gas-tight closure of the coke oven chamber. From DE-OS 26 58 196 a coke oven door is known with a gas channel which surrounds the oven door in an essentially comprehensive manner, which gas channel is bounded by elastically mounted sealing strips. This gas channel is connected with flues of the coke oven chamber in such a manner that suction is caused.   If raw gas flows into the gas channel through a sealing strip which is not completely gas-tight, the gas is sucked off into the respective flue by way of suction. An escape of raw gas from the oven chamber into the atmosphere is thereby reliably prevented.<br>
By virtue of the connection of the flue with the gas channel, the pressure condition of the flue (suction) in the gas channel is adjusted. There is a constant underpressure in the gas channel. This leads to an unwanted extraction of raw gas from the oven chamber and any leakages which may occur at the outer sealing strip may lead to air being sucked into the gas channel.<br>
It is the object of the invention to provide a sealing system to prevent emissions and air influx at coke oven chambers which reliably prevents the escape of raw gas from the coke oven chamber and also the air influx into the coke oven chamber.<br>
-2-<br><br>
This object is achieved with the characteristics of Claim 1.<br>
Further developments are described in the characteristics of the subclaims.<br>
The gas channel according to the invention which surrounds the coke oven door has at least one permanent connection with the coke oven chamber. The preferred connection is a connection to the gas collecting space.   At the commencement of the coking process, the raw gas in the coke oven chamber is under overpressure. Due to local pressure peaks, the raw gas can arrive into the gas channel through the inner door sealing strip.   There it expands and is no longer capable of penetrating also the outer sealing strip. Since the gas channel is in communication with the coke oven chamber, the raw gas collecting in the gas channel is conveyed into the coke oven without emissions being formed. This also applies to leakiness, i.e. unwanted communication at the inner door sealing strip.<br>
In particular a permanent connection of the gas channel with the gas collecting space causes the unimpeded formation of the gas collecting space pressure in the gas channel. In the event of high coke oven chambers it is advantageous to provide fluidic connections at the inner door sealing strip also below the gas collecting space. Local pressure peaks in the vicinity of the door of the coke oven chamber can rapidly be reduced in this manner.<br>
During the coking process, the raw gas pressure in the coke oven chamber can sink to an underpressure (for instance in the region of the furnace bottom). Vice versa, the raw gas can be sucked from the gas channel via the inner sealing strip into the coke oven chamber.   In this situation it is an advantage that no air can be sucked into the coke oven chamber, since the gas channel is not filled with air but with raw gas.<br>
Since the gas channel is not directly connected with the coking coal it cannot be blocked by the charged coking coal.<br>
The gas channel has a fluidic connection with the coke oven chamber. As has already been described, the same pressure as that prevailing in the coke oven chamber results in the gas channel thereby assisting gas pressure equalisation.   This allows for the gas pressure in the gas channel to be influenced or controlled by a pressure control of the chamber.<br>
3<br><br>
Advantageously this can be performed by using the chamber pressure control method known from DE 43 21 676 C2. In accordance with this patent, the control of the gas pressure of the coke oven chamber is achieved via a water level height regulation in the cup-shaped restrictor device which can be filled withwater and is arranged in the rising pipe elbow.<br>
It is also possible to control the gas pressure in the gas channel via the back pressure regulation jointly for all coke oven doors via the coking process time.<br>
The gas channel is advantageously arranged at the coke oven door. It can also be designed such that it can be used for retrofitting in existing coke oven doors. In this way it is possible, with little effort and expenditure, to reduce emissions in existing coke oven chambers.<br>
Another alternative is to integrate the gas channel into the door frame of the coke oven chamber.<br>
Depending on the spatial conditions within the region of the coke oven door, on principle, the gas channel can have any type of cross-section. It can for instance be in the form of a trapezium with unequal legs.<br>
The door sealing strips of the gas channel can also have varying shapes of door luting edges. They can for instance be designed as a one-sided wedge shape, they can be slit or they can be rounded. The preferred version is the one-sided wedge-shape design for the door luting edge. Tests have shown that this wedge-shaped design of the luting edge has achieved the best sealing results. In this aspect, the arrangement of the wedge side is of significant importance. Preferably, the respective wedge side of the inner and outer door sealing strips shall be arranged in the direction of the higher gas pressure being applied at the respective door sealing strip. In this way the tar condensate forming in this process is being pressed into the wedge-shape and thus improves the sealing quality of the door sealing strip.<br>
Otherwise, all door sealing strip forms known from the field of coking technology can be used.<br>
The contact forces for the door sealing strips are decisively influenced by the respective door locks. In the coke oven door with gas channel in accordance with the invention, it is<br>
4<br><br>
necessary for the contact forces to be distributed onto both door sealing strips. In this arrangement, the distribution of the contact forces can be designed in such a way that the inner door sealing strip experiences a higher contact force than the outer door sealing strip. This may be necessary because of the higher pressure exerted onto the inner door sealing strip by the raw gas.<br>
In order to achieve the best sealing result with the contact forces available, the force distribution must be specifically determined for each individual case. Such varying force distribution can for instance be achieved by elastic door sealing strips which do not touch down onto the sealing surfaces of the door frame simultaneously, i.e. the door sealing strips are of different lengths relative to the door frame. The door sealing strips can also be designed with different bending behaviour, i.e. as a result of the shape and varying wall thicknesses of the design.<br>
It is possible to operate the inventive oven door with gas channel dependent on the coking time with an underpressure near 0 mbar in the gas channel at the commencement of the coking process and to remove the underpressure in the gas channel towards the end of the coking process.   By virtue of this operational manner it is impossible for emissions to arise. Such a minor underpressure can for instance be set by means of the above mentioned chamber pressure control. At a minor underpressure, an influx of ambient air into the gas channel is almost impossible. In the event however that air did enter the gas channel door, this would not lead to combustion in the gas channel, since the ignition limits for the gas mixture being created there and the required ignition temperatures could not possibly be reached.   For this reason, there is no risk of flame formation within the gas channel.   Air cannot, in any event, flow into the oven region filled with coking coal. For this reason it is not possible for combustion processes to occur at the oven walls and consequent damage is therefore prevented. In the event air leaked into the gas channel during an unintentional operation at excessive underpressure, such air would be conveyed from the gas channel into the gas collecting space.<br>
In accordance with a further development of the invention, the connections between the coke oven chamber and the gas channel are provided with a restriction at the inner door sealing strip. The restriction is designed such that actuation can be performed from the outside and during the oven operation can be stepless across the range, from fully open to fully closed.<br>
-5-<br><br>
With the aid of adjustable restrictors it is possible to influence the gas pressure in the gas channel by opening or closing the restrictor in a specific manner, and that individually for each oven door.<br>
It is therefore possible to set a different gas pressure and any flow direction in the gas channel in the respective doors on the coking side and on the machine side in spite of the same pressure in the gas collecting space. In this way it is possible to prevent emissions or air influx at each oven door by adjusting the restrictors even in instances of varying gas generation and at varying pressures.<br>
Tests have shown that the temperatures at the door sealing strips during the oven operation should be kept within the temperature range of between approx. 100°C and approx. 200°C. This results in the effective sealing of the door sealing strip due to the tar present at the door sealing strip.<br>
This temperature range can be achieved by appropriate measures such as insulation or influencing the heat transfer of the door lutings, dissipation of the excess heat by cooling, such as for instance cooling fins and provision of suitable heat transfer means.   Due to the correct combination of insulation, heat dissipation and cooling being selected, it is possible to maintain the desired temperature range. It may be necessary to provide varying combinations of cooling and insulation across the height of the coke oven door.<br>
It is also possible to actively influence the temperature of the door sealing strips. In the event a region of the door sealing strip had a temperature of above 200°C, it would be possible to cool the region down to the temperature range of between approx. 100°C and approx. 200°C by admitting a cooling medium.<br>
The components described above and contained in the claims and described in the embodiment example and to be used in accordance with the invention are not subject to any specialised requirements with regard to their size, design, material choice and technical conception so that the selection criteria known in the respective area of application can find unrestricted use within the scope of the claims.<br><br>
Further details, characteristics and advantages of the object of the invention are explained in the following description by reference to the drawing showing, by way of an example, a preferred embodiment of an oven door. The drawing shows in<br>
