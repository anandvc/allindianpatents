The present application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application<br>
Serial No. 60/802,716, which was filed on May 22, 2006, and which was entitled<br>
HYDROGEN-PRODUCING FUEL PROCESSING ASSEMBLIES AND MEMBRANE-<br>
BASED SEPARATION ASSEMBLIES FOR USE THEREWITH and similarly entitled<br>
U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 11/750,806, which was filed on May 18, 2007.<br>
The complete disclosures of the above-identified patent applications are hereby<br>
incorporated by reference for all purposes.<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present disclosure relates generally to hydrogen-processing assemblies,<br>
and more particularly to hydrogen-processing assemblies and components thereof<br>
for purifying hydrogen gas.<br>
Background of the Disclosure<br>
Purified hydrogen gas is used in the manufacture of many products including<br>
metals, edible fats and oils, and semiconductors and microelectronics. Purified<br>
hydrogen gas also is an important fuel source for many energy conservation devices.<br>
For example, fuel cells use purified hydrogen gas and an oxidant to produce<br>
electrical potential. Various processes and devices may be used to produce<br>
hydrogen gas. However, many hydrogen-producing processes produce an impure<br>
hydrogen gas stream, which may also be referred to as a mixed gas stream that<br>
contains hydrogen gas and other gases. Prior to delivering this stream to a fuel cell<br>
stack or other hydrogen-consuming device, the mixed gas stream may be purified,<br>
such as to remove at least a portion of the other gases.<br>
A suitable mechanism for increasing the hydrogen purity of the mixed gas<br>
stream is to utilize at least one hydrogen-selective membrane to separate the mixed<br>
gas stream into a product stream and a byproduct stream. The product stream<br>
contains a greater concentration of hydrogen gas and/or a reduced concentration of<br>
one or more of the other gases than the mixed gas stream. The byproduct stream<br>
contains at least a substantial portion of one or more of the other gases from the<br>
mixed gas stream. Hydrogen purification using one or more hydrogen-selective<br>
membranes is a pressure driven separation process, in which the one or more<br>
hydrogen-selective membranes are contained in a pressure vessel. The mixed gas<br>
stream contacts the mixed gas surface of the membrane(s), and the product stream<br>
Is formed from at least a portion of the mixed gas stream that permeates through the<br><br>
membrane(s). The byproduct stream is formed from at least a portion of the mixed<br>
gas stream that does not permeate through the membrane(s). The pressure vessel is<br>
typically sealed to prevent gases from entering or leaving the pressure vessel except<br>
through defined inlet and outlet ports or conduits.<br>

Detailed Description and Best Mode of the Disclosure<br>
An illustrative, non-exclusive example of a hydrogen-processing assembly<br>
according to the present disclosure is schematically illustrated in cross-section in<br>
Fig. 1 and generally indicated at 10. Assembly 10 includes a hydrogen-separation<br>
region 12 and an enclosure 14. Enclosure 14 includes a body 16 that defines an<br>
internal volume 18 having an internal perimeter 20.<br>
Enclosure 14 may include at least a first portion 22 and a second portion 24<br>
coupled together to form body 16 in the form of a sealed pressure vessel that<br>
includes defined input and output ports that define fluid paths by which gases or<br>
other fluids are delivered into and removed from the enclosure's internal volume.<br>
First and second portions 22, 24 may be coupled together using any suitable<br>
retention mechanism, or structure, 26. Examples of suitable structures 26 include<br>
welds and/or bolts, although any suitable retention mechanism is within the scope of<br>
the present disclosure. Examples of seals that may be used to provide a fluid-tight<br>
interface between first and second portions 22, 24 include, but are not limited to,<br>
gaskets and/or welds. Additionally or alternatively, first and second portions 22, 24<br>
may be secured together so that at least a predetermined amount of compression is<br>
applied to various components that define the hydrogen-separation region within the<br>
enclosure and/or other components that may be incorporated into a hydrogen-<br>
processing assembly according to the present disclosure. In other words, first and<br>
second portions 22, 24, when secured together by a suitable retention mechanism or<br>
structure, may apply compression to various components that define the hydrogen-<br>
separation region and/or other components housed within an enclosure of a<br>
hydrogen-processing assembly, thereby maintaining an appropriate position of the<br>
various components within the enclosure. Additionally or alternatively, the<br>
compression applied to the various components that define the hydrogen-separation<br>
region and/or other components may provide fluid-tight interfaces between the<br>
various components that define the hydrogen-separation region, various other<br>
components, and/or between the components that define the hydrogen-separation<br>
region and other components.<br>
Enclosure 14 includes a mixed gas region 32 and a permeate region 34. The<br>
mixed gas and permeate regions are separated by hydrogen-separation region 12. At<br>
least one input port 36 is provided, through which a fluid stream 38 is delivered to the<br>
enclosure. In the schematically illustrated example shown in Fig. 1, fluid stream 38 is<br>
indicated to be a mixed gas stream 40 that contains hydrogen gas 42 and other<br>
gases 44 that are delivered to mixed gas region 32. Hydrogen gas may be a majority<br><br>
component of the mixed gas stream. As somewhat schematically illustrated in Fig. 1,<br>
hydrogen-separation region 12 extends between mixed gas region 32 and permeate<br>
region 34 so that gas in the mixed gas region must pass through the hydrogen-<br>
separation region in order to enter the permeate region. As discussed in more detail<br>
herein, this may require the gas to pass through at least one hydrogen-selective<br>
membrane. The permeate and mixed gas regions may be of any suitable relative<br>
size within the enclosure.<br>
Enclosure 14 also includes at least one product output port 46, through which<br>
a permeate stream 48 is removed from permeate region 34. The permeate stream<br>
contains at least one of a greater concentration of hydrogen gas and a lower<br>
concentration of the other gases than the mixed gas stream. It is within the scope of<br>
the present disclosure that permeate stream 48 may (but is not required to) also at<br>
least initially include a carrier, or sweep, gas component, such as may be delivered<br>
as a sweep gas stream 37 through a sweep gas port 39 that is in fluid communication<br>
with the permeate region. The enclosure also includes at least one byproduct output<br>
port 50, through which a byproduct stream 52 containing at least one of a substantial<br>
portion of the other gases 44 and a reduced concentration of hydrogen gas (relative<br>
to the mixed gas stream) is removed from the mixed gas region 32.<br>
Hydrogen-separation region 12 includes at least one hydrogen-selective<br>
membrane 54 having a first, or mixed gas, surface 56, which is oriented for contact<br>
by mixed gas stream 40, and a second, or permeate, surface 58, which is generally<br>
opposed to surface 56. Accordingly, in the schematically illustrated example of Fig. 1,<br>
mixed gas stream 40 is delivered to the mixed gas region of the enclosure so that it<br>
comes into contact with the mixed gas surface of the one or more hydrogen-selective<br>
membranes. Permeate stream 48 is formed from at least a portion of the mixed gas<br>
stream that passes through the hydrogen-separation region to permeate region 34.<br>
Byproduct stream 52 is formed from at least a portion of the mixed gas stream that<br>
does not pass through the separation region. In some embodiments, byproduct<br>
stream 52 may contain a portion of the hydrogen gas present in the mixed gas<br>
stream. The separation region may (but is not required to) also be adapted to trap or<br>
otherwise retain at least a portion of the other gases, which may then be removed as<br>
a byproduct stream as the separation region is replaced, regenerated, or otherwise<br>
recharged.<br>
In Fig 1, streams 37, 40, 48, and 52 schematically represent that each of<br>
these streams may include more than one actual stream flowing into or out of<br>
assembly 10. For example, assembly 10 may receive a plurality of mixed gas<br><br>
streams 40, a single mixed gas stream 40 that is divided into two or more streams<br>
prior to contacting separation region 12, a single stream that is delivered into internal<br>
volume 18, etc. Accordingly, enclosure 14 may include more than one input port 36.<br>
Similarly, an enclosure 14 according to the present disclosure may include more than<br>
one sweep gas port 39, more than one product outlet port 46, and/or more than one<br>
byproduct outlet port 50.<br>
The hydrogen-selective membranes may be formed of any hydrogen-<br>
permeable material suitable for use in the operating environment and parameters in<br>
which hydrogen-processing assembly 10 is operated. Illustrative, non-exclusive<br>
examples of suitable materials for membranes 54 are disclosed in U.S. Patent<br>
Nos. 6,537,352 and 5,997,594, and in U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial<br>
No. 60/854,058, the entire disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference<br>
for ail purposes. In some embodiments, the hydrogen-selective membranes may be<br>
formed from at least one of palladium and a palladium alloy. Illustrative, non-<br>
exclusive examples of palladium alloys include alloys of palladium with copper, silver,<br>
and/or gold. However, the membranes may be formed from other hydrogen-<br>
permeable and/or hydrogen-selective materials, including metals and metal alloys<br>
other than palladium and palladium alloys. Illustrative examples of various<br>
membranes, membrane configurations, and methods for preparing the same are<br>
disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,152,995, 6,221,117, 6,319,306, and 6,537,352, the<br>
complete disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.<br>
In some embodiments, a plurality of spaced-apart hydrogen-selective<br>
membranes 54 may be used in a hydrogen-separation region to form at least a<br>
portion of a hydrogen-separation assembly 28. When present, the plurality of<br>
membranes may collectively define one or more membrane assemblies, or<br>
membrane assemblies, 30. In such embodiments, the hydrogen-separation<br>
assembly 28 may generally extend from first portion 22 to second portion 24.<br>
Accordingly, the first and second portions of the enclosure may effectively compress<br>
the hydrogen-separation assembly. Other configurations of enclosure 14 are equally<br>
within the scope of the present disclosure. For example, in some embodiments,<br>
enclosure 14 may additionally or alternatively include end plates coupled to opposite<br>
sides of a body portion. In such embodiments, the end plates may effectively<br>
compress the hydrogen-separation assembly 28 (and other components that may be<br>
housed within the enclosure) between the pair of opposing end plates.<br>
Hydrogen purification using one or more hydrogen-selective membranes is<br>
typically a pressure-driven separation process in which the mixed gas stream is<br><br>
delivered into contact with the mixed gas surfaces of the membranes at a higher<br>
pressure than the gases in the permeate region of the hydrogen-separation region.<br>
Although not required to all embodiments, the hydrogen-separation region may be<br>
heated via any suitable mechanism to an elevated temperature when the hydrogen-<br>
separation region is utilized to separate the mixed gas stream into the permeate and<br>
byproduct streams. Illustrative, non-exclusive examples of suitable operating<br>
temperatures for hydrogen purification using palladium and palladium alloy<br>
membranes include temperatures of at least 275° C, temperatures of at least 325° C,<br>
temperatures of at least 350° C, temperatures in the range of 275-500° C,<br>
temperatures in the range of 275-375° C, temperatures in the range of 300-450° C,<br>
temperatures in the range of 350-450° C, and the like.<br>
In some embodiments, and as schematically illustrated in Fig. 1, hydrogen-<br>
processing assemblies 10 may, though are not required to, further include a<br>
hydrogen-producing region 70. Illustrative, non-exclusive examples of hydrogen-<br>
producing regions suitable for incorporation in hydrogen-processing assemblies 10 of<br>
the present disclosure are disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 11/263,726<br>
and U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 60/802,716, the complete<br>
disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference for all purposes. In such<br>
embodiments, the first and second portions 22, 24 of body 16 may effectively<br>
compress both the hydrogen-separation assembly and one or more components of<br>
the hydrogen-producing region.<br>
In embodiments incorporating a hydrogen-producing region 70, the fluid<br>
stream (38) that is delivered to the internal volume of enclosure 14 may be in the<br>
form of one or more hydrogen-producing fluids, or feed streams, 72. The feed<br>
stream, or streams, are delivered to the hydrogen-producing region 70, which may<br>
include a suitable catalyst 73 for catalyzing the formation of hydrogen gas from the<br>
feed stream(s) delivered thereto. Illustrative, non-exclusive examples of feed<br>
stream(s) 72 include water 74 and/or a carbon-containing feedstock 76, which (when<br>
present) may be delivered In the same or separate fluid streams.<br>
In the hydrogen-producing region, the feed stream(s) chemically react to<br>
produce hydrogen gas therefrom in the form of mixed gas stream 40. In other words,<br>
rather than receiving mixed gas stream 40 from an external source (as schematically<br>
illustrated In a solid arrow in Fig. 1), hydrogen-processing assemblies 10 according to<br>
the present disclosure may optionally include a hydrogen-producing region 70 that is<br>
housed within enclosure 14 itself. This hydrogen-producing region produces mixed<br>
gas stream 40 (schematically illustrated as a dashed arrow in Fig. 1) containing<br><br>
hydrogen gas 42 and other gases 44 within the enclosure, and this mixed gas stream<br>
is then delivered to mixed gas region 32 and separated into permeate and byproduct<br>
streams by hydrogen-separation region 12, as discussed above and schematically<br>
illustrated in Fig. 1.<br>
Illustrative, non-exclusive examples of suitable mechanisms for producing<br>
mixed gas stream 40 from one or more feed stream(s) include steam reforming and<br>
autbthermal reforming, in which reforming catalysts are used to produce hydrogen<br>
gas from at least one feed stream 72 containing water 74 and a carbon-containing<br>
feedstock 76. In a steam reforming process, hydrogen-producing region 70 may be<br>
referred to as a reforming region, and output, or mixed gas, stream 40 may be<br>
referred to as a reformate stream. The other gases that are typically present In the<br>
reformate stream include carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane, steam, and/or<br>
unreacted carbon-containing feedstock. In an autothermal reforming reaction, a<br>
suitable autothermal reforming catalyst is used to produce hydrogen gas from water<br>
and a carbon-containing feedstock in the presence of air. When autothermal<br>
reforming is used, the fuel processor further includes an air delivery assembly that is<br>
adapted to deliver an air stream to the hydrogen-producing region. Autothermal<br>
hydrogen-producing reactions utilize a primary endothermic reaction that is utilized in<br>
conjunction with an exothermic partial oxidation reaction, which generates heat within<br>
the hydrogen-producing region upon initiation of the initial oxidation reaction.<br>
Illustrative, non-exclusive examples of other suitable mechanisms for<br>
producing hydrogen gas include pyrolysis and catalytic partial oxidation of a carbon-<br>
containing feedstock, in which case the feed stream includes a carbon-containing<br>
feedstock and does not (or does not need to) contain water. A further illustrative,<br>
non-exclusive example of a mechanism for producing hydrogen gas is electrolysis, in<br>
which case the feed stream Includes water but not a carbon-containing feedstock.<br>
Illustrative, non-exclusive examples of suitable carbon-containing feedstocks include<br>
at least one hydrocarbon or alcohol. Illustrative, non-exclusive examples of suitable<br>
hydrocarbons include methane, propane, butane, natural gas, diesel, kerosene,<br>
gasoline and the like. Illustrative, non-exclusive examples of suitable alcohols include<br>
methanol, ethanol, and polyols, such as ethylene glycol and propylene glycol. It is<br>
within the scope of the present disclosure that a hydrogen-processing assembly 10<br>
that includes a hydrogen-producing region 70 may utilize more than a single<br>
hydrogen-producing mechanism in the hydrogen-producing region.<br>
Fig. 2 schematically Illustrates an illustrative, non-exclusive example of a<br>
hydrogen-processing assembly 10 from a slightly different perspective than<br><br>
schematically illustrated in Fig. 1. That is, Fig. 2 may be described as a schematic<br>
plan view of a cross-section of an illustrative, non-exclusive example of a hydrogen-<br>
processing assembly 10. In Fig. 2, hydrogen-separation assembly 28 is positioned<br>
within internal volume 18 of enclosure 14 in a spaced relation to at least a portion of<br>
internal perimeter 20 of body 16. Hydrogen-separation assembly 28 may be<br>
described as having an outer perimeter 60. For hydrogen-separation assemblies<br>
containing one or more planar, or generally planar, membranes, this outer perimeter<br>
may be described as being measured in, or parallel to, the plane of the membrane(s).<br>
That is, outer perimeter 60 may refer to at least a portion of the generally external<br>
surface of a hydrogen-separation region, hydrogen-separation assembly, or<br>
membrane assembly. Accordingly, in the example schematically illustrated In Fig. 2,<br>
the permeate region 34 may be described as being defined between at least a<br>
portion of the outer perimeter 60 and at least a portion of the internal perimeter 20 of<br>
body 16. In such embodiments, the permeate region Is in direct fluid communication<br>
with the internal perimeter of the body. Stated differently, the permeate stream 48<br>
exits hydrogen-separation region 28 directly into the internal volume 18 of the<br>
enclosure 14.<br>
Various configurations of the relation between hydrogen-separation<br>
assembly 28 and internal perimeter 20 are within the scope of the present disclosure.<br>
For example, and as schematically illustrated in Fig. 2, permeate region 34 may be<br>
defined between an entire outer perimeter (that is, an entire perimeter as viewed<br>
from a specific cross-section but not necessarily the entire outer surface) of<br>
hydrogen-separation assembly 28 and at least a portion of internal perimeter 20 of<br>
enclosure body 16. Additionally or alternatively, the permeate region may be defined<br>
between at least a majority of an outer perimeter of the hydrogen-separation<br>
assembly and at least a portion of the Internal perimeter of the enclosure body. For<br>
example, and as discussed above, in some embodiments, the hydrogen-separation<br>
assembly Is directly or indirectly compressed between portions of the enclosure, and<br>
therefore the portions of the outer perimeter or outer surface of the hydrogen-<br>
separation assembly that are in direct or indirect contact with the enclosure body may<br>
not define a portion of the permeate region. Additionally or alternatively, and as<br>
schematically illustrated in dashed lines in Fig. 2, additional structure 62 may prevent<br>
a portion of the outer perimeter of the hydrogen-separation assembly and a portion of<br>
the internal perimeter of the body from defining the permeate region. In some such<br>
embodiments, the outer perimeter of the hydrogen-separation assembly may be<br>
described as having two generally opposed portions 64, 66, and the permeate region<br><br>
therefore defined between at least two generally opposed portions 68, 69 of internal<br>
perimeter 20 of body 16 and the two generally opposed portions 64, 66 of outer<br>
perimeter 60 of the hydrogen-separation assembly.<br>
Additionally or alternatively, in embodiments where enclosure 14 includes at<br>
least a first portion and a second portion coupled together to form body 18, the<br>
spaced relation of the hydrogen-separation assembly and at least a portion of<br>
internal perimeter 20 of the enclosure body 16 may be maintained by the<br>
compression between the first and second portions of the body. In other words, to<br>
maintain the spaced relation between the hydrogen-separation assembly and the<br>
enclosure body, hydrogen-processing assembly 10 may be assembled so that the<br>
compression between the body portions generally prevents the hydrogen-separation<br>
assembly from moving within the enclosure relative to the body.<br>
Figs. 3 and 4 schematically illustrate non-exclusive examples of membrane<br>
assemblies 30 that may be used in hydrogen-processing assemblies according to the<br>
present disclosure. In some embodiments, membrane assemblies 30 may form at<br>
least a portion of a hydrogen-separation assembly 28. As schematically illustrated in<br>
Figs. 3 and 4, membrane assemblies 30 may (but are not required to) be generally<br>
planar. That is, the membrane assemblies may have generally parallel opposing<br>
sides. Similarly, hydrogen-separation assemblies, which may include one or more<br>
membrane assemblies, may likewise (but are not required to) be generally planar.<br>
Membrane assemblies, and thus hydrogen-separation assemblies, according to the<br>
present disclosure include at least one hydrogen-selective membrane 54 and at least<br>
one harvesting region 78 that is adjacent to the permeate surface 58 of the at least<br>
one hydrogen-selective membrane. The harvesting region of a membrane assembly<br>
is a conduit, channel, or other region through which the permeate stream 48 travels,<br>
or flows, from the permeate surface 58 of the membrane to the permeate region of<br>
the internal volume.<br>
In some embodiments, the harvesting region may be in direct fluid<br>
communication with the permeate region of the enclosure's internal volume, and thus<br>
also in direct fluid communication with the internal perimeter of the enclosure. In such<br>
an embodiment, the permeate gas stream flows directly from the harvesting region,<br>
which is at least substantially (if not completely) coextensive with the one or more<br>
hydrogen-selective membranes of the hydrogen-separation assembly, into the<br>
permeate region (which is exterior of the hydrogen-separation assembly) without<br>
flowing through a series of gasket-defined and/or manifold-defined flow passages.<br><br>
The permeate stream may, in such an embodiment, exit the membrane<br>
assembly and/or the hydrogen-separation assembly in a direction that is generally<br>
parallel to the membrane, membrane assembly, and/or hydrogen-separation<br>
assembly. Stated differently, in some embodiments, the hydrogen-separation<br>
assembly may be configured so the permeate stream exits the membrane assembly<br>
and/or hydrogen-separation assembly in a direction generally parallel to the<br>
hydrogen-selective assembly. In some embodiments, the hydrogen-selective<br>
assembly may be configured to minimize the flow path, or length, through which the<br>
permeate gas must travel through the harvesting conduit membrane assembly<br>
Additionally or alternatively, in some embodiments, the hydrogen-separation<br>
assembly may be configured so the permeate stream exits the hydrogen-separation<br>
assembly in a direction generally parallel to the plane of the hydrogen-selective<br>
membrane. Additionally or alternatively, the hydrogen-separation assembly may be<br>
adapted to receive the mixed gas stream 40 from a first direction and configured so<br>
the permeate stream exits the hydrogen-separation assembly in a second direction<br>
generally perpendicular to the first direction. Additionally or alternatively, the<br>
hydrogen-separation assembly may be configured so the permeate stream flows<br>
from the permeate surface to the permeate region in a direction generally parallel to<br>
the permeate surface of the membrane(s). Additionally or alternatively, the hydrogen-<br>
separation assembly may be configured so the permeate stream flows through the<br>
harvesting region in a direction that is generally parallel to the plane of the at least<br>
one hydrogen-selective membrane.<br>
Some membrane assemblies according to the present disclosure may not<br>
include permeate gaskets that assist in forming gas seals about the periphery of the<br>
permeate surface of the hydrogen-selective membranes and adjacent structure. That<br>
is, such membrane assemblies according to the present disclosure may not include<br>
gaskets that provide seals around the entire perimeter of the permeate surface of<br>
hydrogen-selective membranes. The absence of a permeate gasket or other<br>
continuous seal associated with the permeate surface of a hydrogen-selective<br>
membrane may provide greater hydrogen separation and longer membrane life than<br>
some other configurations for membrane-based separation assemblies. The absence<br>
of the permeate gasket may reduce the likelihood of wrinkles, creases, or other<br>
forces on the hydrogen-selective membranes, such as responsive to thermal cycling<br>
of the membranes. This thermal cycling, and the resultant forces upon the<br>
membranes, may have a greater likelihood of causing holes, cracks, and/or leak<br>
paths to form in the membranes when permeate gaskets are used.<br><br>
Harvesting region 78 may be defined by various structure(s) incorporated into<br>
a membrane assembly 30 or hydrogen-separation assembly 28 to support the<br>
membrane(s) such that the permeate surface(s) of the membrane(s) are supported in<br>
a manner that permits gas that passes through the membrane to be collected and<br>
extracted to form the permeate gas stream. For example, the harvesting region may<br>
be defined by a support, such as a screen structure 80 that includes at least one<br>
screen. Screen structure 80 may (but is not required to) include a plurality of screen<br>
members including screen members of varying coarseness. For example, screen<br>
structure 80 may include a coarse mesh screen sandwiched between fine mesh<br>
screens, where the terms "fine" and "coarse" are relative terms. In some<br>
embodiments, the outer screen members are selected to support membranes 54<br>
without piercing the membranes and without having sufficient apertures, edges or<br>
other projections that may pierce, weaken or otherwise damage the membrane under<br>
the operating conditions with which assembly 10 is operated. Some embodiments of<br>
screen structure 80 may use a relatively coarser inner screen member to provide for<br>
enhanced, or larger, parallel flow conduits, although this is not required to all<br>
embodiments. In other words, the finer mesh screens may provide better protection<br>
for the membranes, while the coarser mesh screen(s) may provide better flow<br>
generally parallel to the membranes, and in some embodiments may be selected to<br>
be stiffer, or less flexible, than the finer mesh screens.<br>
Additionally or alternatively, membrane assemblies may incorporate screen<br>
structure 80 directly adjacent the permeate surface of a hydrogen-selective<br>
membrane. In other words, membrane assemblies 30, and thus hydrogen-separation<br>
assemblies 28, may be constructed without a gasket directly adjacent the permeate<br>
surface of the membrane. Stated differently, in some embodiments, hydrogen-<br>
separation assemblies do not include a gasket between the permeate surface and<br>
the adjacent screen or other support structure.<br>
The membrane assemblies that are schematically illustrated in Figs. 3 and 4<br>
may be described as having harvesting regions 78 that are generally parallel to the at<br>
least one hydrogen-selective membrane 54. Additionally or alternatively, the<br>
harvesting region may be described as being generally coextensive with the at least<br>
one hydrogen-selective membrane.<br>
The non-exclusive example of a membrane assembly 30 illustrated in Fig. 3<br>
includes only a single hydrogen-selective membrane, and may be referred to as a<br>
single-membrane assembly 88. Single-membrane assembly 88 includes a harvesting<br>
region 78 defined between the permeate surface 58 of the membrane and a barrier<br><br>
structure 82. Barrier structure 82 may be any suitable structure that includes a<br>
surface 84 generally opposed to the permeate surface 58 of membrane 54 and<br>
through which gas that permeates into the harvesting conduit does not pass. Instead,<br>
the barrier structure, which is generally opposed to the permeate surface of<br>
membrane 54 and spaced apart therefrom, defines a boundary that redirects the flow<br>
of permeate gas along the harvesting conduit.' As illustrative, non-exclusive<br>
examples, barrier structure 82 may be a plate or other structure incorporated into a<br>
hydrogen-separation assembly. Additionally or alternatively, barrier structure 82 may<br>
be a wall of an enclosure, or other component, of a hydrogen-processing assembly<br>
according to the present disclosure. Any suitable structure that defines harvesting<br>
conduit 78 between itself and a hydrogen-selective membrane is within the scope of<br>
the present disclosure.<br>
As schematically illustrated in Fig. 4, membrane assemblies (and thus<br>
hydrogen-separation assemblies) according to the present disclosure may include a<br>
plurality of hydrogen-selective membranes. The non-exclusive example of a<br>
membrane assembly 30 illustrated in Fig. 4 includes a pair of hydrogen-selective<br>
membranes 54, and may be referred to as a double-membrane assembly 90. In<br>
double-membrane assembly 90, the respective permeate surfaces 58 generally face<br>
each other and are spaced apart to define a harvesting region 78 through which the<br>
permeate stream flows to the permeate region of the internal volume of the<br>
enclosure. As discussed above, membrane assemblies 30, and thus double-<br>
membrane assemblies 90, may (but are not required to) include a screen<br>
structure 80 that defines the harvesting conduit. Stated differently, screen<br>
structure 80 may be generally coextensive with the spaced apart opposing permeate<br>
surfaces of a pair of hydrogen-selective membranes.<br>
Additionally or alternatively, and as schematically illustrated in Figs. 3 and 4,<br>
membrane assemblies 30 (and thus hydrogen-separation assemblies 28) according<br>
to the present disclosure may include suitable alternative support structure 86 that is<br>
configured to define a harvesting conduit. For example, support structure 86 may<br>
include a gasket or other spacer that generally creates a channel, conduit, or other<br>
suitable region adjacent the permeate surface(s) of one or more hydrogen-selective<br>
membranes. Stated differently, suitable support structure 86 may be configured to<br>
space a hydrogen-selective membrane away from either a corresponding hydrogen-<br>
selective membrane, as in a double-membrane assembly 90, or away from a suitable<br>
barrier structure 82, as in a single-membrane assembly 88, to define a channel,<br>
conduit, or other region therebetween that defines a harvesting region for the flow of<br><br>
a permeate stream from the one or more membranes to the permeate region of a<br>
hydrogen-processing assembly.<br>
Additionally or alternatively, hydrogen-separation assemblies according to the<br>
present disclosure may include more than one membrane assembly. Such assembly<br>
of multiple membrane assemblies may be described as membrane assemblies<br>
themselves or as hydrogen-separation assemblies. In some embodiments, a<br>
hydrogen-separation assembly may include membrane assemblies having various<br>
configurations. For example, a non-exclusive example of a hydrogen-separation<br>
assembly according to the present disclosure may include a single-membrane<br>
assembly 88 adjacent a double-membrane assembly 90. In such a configuration, the<br>
hydrogen-separation assembly may be described as including a plurality of spaced<br>
apart hydrogen-selective membranes including a pair of membranes with their<br>
respective permeate surfaces generally facing each other and spaced apart to define<br>
a harvesting region. The plurality of membranes may further include at least a third<br>
membrane with its mixed gas surface generally facing and spaced apart from the<br>
mixed gas surface of one of the membranes of the pair of membranes. In such a<br>
configuration, the space defined between the two mixed gas surfaces may define at<br>
least a portion of the mixed gas region of the enclosure of a hydrogen-processing<br>
assembly according to the present disclosure. Illustrative, non-exclusive examples of<br>
hydrogen-separation assemblies including these characteristics are illustrated in<br>
Figs. 8 and 11 and are described in greater detail below.<br>
Figs. 5-11 illustrate various illustrative non-exclusive examples of<br>
embodiments of hydrogen-processing assemblies 10, and components thereof,<br>
according to the present disclosure. Assemblies 10 according to the present<br>
disclosure, while illustrated in Figs. 5-11 with like numerals corresponding to the<br>
various components and portions thereof, etc. introduced above, are not limited to<br>
such illustrated configurations. For example, the shape, number, and location of<br>
various components, including, but not limited to, the input and output ports, the<br>
hydrogen-separation assembly, membrane assemblies within the hydrogen-<br>
separation assembly, the hydrogen-producing region (if any), etc. are not limited to<br>
the configurations illustrated. Illustrative, non-exclusive examples of enclosures<br>
having various shapes and configurations differing from those illustrated herein, and<br>
which may be used and/or modified to be used for hydrogen-processing assemblies<br>
according to the present disclosure are disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,494,937,<br>
6.569.227. 6.723.156. and 6719.832. and U.S. Patent Application Serial<br><br>
Nos. 11/263,726, and 11/638,076, the entire disclosures of which are hereby<br>
incorporated by reference for all purposes.<br>
In Fig. 5, an example of a suitable construction for a hydrogen-processing<br>
assembly 10 that does not include a hydrogen-producing region is shown in an<br>
unassembled, exploded condition, and is generally indicated at 100. As shown in<br>
Fig. 5, the enclosure of assembly 100 includes a first body portion 22 and a second<br>
body portion 24. During assembly of assembly 100, hydrogen-separation<br>
assembly 28 is positioned in internal volume 16 so that the permeate region is<br>
defined between at least a portion of the perimeter 60 of the hydrogen-separation<br>
assembly and at least a portion of the inside perimeter 20 of the first body portion 22.<br>
In other words, the hydrogen-separation assembly is placed within the internal<br>
volume of the first body portion 16 so that it is in a spaced relation to the internal<br>
perimeter of the first body portion to define a permeate region therebetween. Then,<br>
the second body portion 24 is positioned at least partially within the opening to the<br>
first body portion 22 to compress the hydrogen-separation assembly within the<br>
internal volume. A seal weld or other suitable sealing mechanism or structure may<br>
then be applied at the interface of the body portions to create a fluid-tight interface.<br>
As discussed, it is within the scope of the present disclosure that any suitable<br>
retention mechanism may be used to provide a fluid-tight interface between the body<br>
portions of the enclosure and to further provide a suitable amount of compression to<br>
the hydrogen-separation assembly within the enclosure, such as to provide and/or<br>
maintain internal seals and/or flow paths between and/or within the various<br>
components of the hydrogen-separation assembly.<br>
The non-exclusive illustrative example of enclosure 14 shown in Fig. 5 further<br>
includes an input port 36 for receiving a mixed gas stream for delivery to the mixed<br>
gas region of the internal volume, a product output port 46 for removal of the<br>
hydrogen-rich permeate stream, and a byproduct output port 50 for removal of<br>
byproduct gases.<br>
The non-exclusive illustrative example of a hydrogen-separation assembly 28<br>
illustrated in Fig. 5 may be described as generally planar, and as schematically<br>
illustrated by the multiple arrows extending from the top and bottom (as viewed in<br>
Fig. 5) of the hydrogen-separation assembly, the hydrogen-rich, or permeate, stream<br>
exits the hydrogen-separation assembly in a direction generally parallel to the plane<br>
of the hydrogen-separation assembly. Stated differently, the permeate stream exits<br>
the hydrogen-separation assembly and enters the permeate region of the internal<br>
volume from a direction generally parallel to the plane of the hydrogen-separation<br><br>
assembly and the hydrogen-selective membranes located therein. The hydrogen-<br>
separation assembly illustrated in Fig. 5 includes gas distribution conduits 140<br>
and 170, which define at least portions of the mixed gas region and which provide<br>
flow paths for the mixed gas and byproduct streams, respectively, through the<br>
hydrogen-separation assembly. In other words, the mixed gas stream enters the<br>
enclosure via inlet 36. The portion of the mixed gas stream that does not pass<br>
through the hydrogen-selective membranes (that is, the byproduct stream 52) is<br>
forced into distribution conduit 170 and then out byproduct outlet port 50. The portion<br>
of the mixed gas stream that does pass through the hydrogen-selective membranes<br>
forms permeate stream 48, which is forced into the permeate region of the internal<br>
volume and subsequently expelled from the enclosure via product output port 46.<br>
Enclosure 14 is also illustrated as including optional mounts 150, which may<br>
be used to position the enclosure 14 with respect to other components of a hydrogen<br>
generation system and/or fuel cell system, etc.<br>
As shown in Figs. 5-7, first body portion 22 may include at least one<br>
projection, or guide, 146 that extends into internal volume 16 to align or otherwise<br>
position the hydrogen-separation region within the internal volume of the enclosure.<br>
In Fig. 5, two pairs of guides 146 are illustrated, but it is within the scope of the<br>
present disclosure that no guides, one guide, or any number of guides may be<br>
utilized. When more than one guide is utilized, the guides may have the same or<br>
different sizes, shapes, and/or relative orientations within the enclosure.<br>
As also shown in Figs. 5-7, hydrogen-separation assembly 28 may include<br>
recesses 152 that are sized to receive the guides 146 of the body portion when the<br>
membrane assembly is inserted into internal volume 16. Stated differently, the<br>
recesses on the hydrogen-separation assembly are designed to align with the guides<br>
that extend into the enclosure's internal volume to position the hydrogen-separation<br>
assembly in a selected orientation within the compartment. Accordingly, the first body<br>
portion may be described as providing alignment guides for the hydrogen-separation<br>
assembly. In Fig. 5, it can be seen that second body portion 24 may also include<br>
recesses 152. Recesses 152 may guide, or align, the first and second portions when<br>
the portions are assembled to form the enclosure. The illustrated guides and<br>
recesses are not required to all enclosures and/or hydrogen-separation assemblies<br>
and/or components thereof according to the present disclosure.<br>
As discussed and as somewhat schematically illustrated in Figs. 6-7, at least<br>
a portion of the perimeter 60 of the hydrogen-separation assembly 28 does not seal<br>
against at least a portion of the internal perimeter 20 of the internal volume. Instead,<br><br>
a gas passage, or channel 176 exists between hydrogen-separation assembly 28<br>
and the internal perimeter 20 to form at least a portion of the permeate region 34 of<br>
the internal volume. The size of passage 176 may vary within the scope of the<br>
present disclosure, and may be smaller than is depicted for the purpose of<br>
illustration. The hydrogen-rich gas, or permeate stream, may flow through this<br>
passage and be withdrawn from the enclosure through the product output port.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 6, hydrogen-separation assemblies 28 according to the<br>
present disclosure may (but are not required to) include spacers, or protrusions, 124<br>
that extend from at least a portion of the outside perimeter 60 and aid in positioning<br>
the hydrogen-separation assembly within the enclosure in its spaced relation as<br>
described herein. For example, in the illustrated example, spacers 124 may be<br>
generally trapezoidal in shape and may extend from one or more of the various<br>
components that make up a hydrogen-separation assembly, although any suitable<br>
shape is within the scope of the present disclosure. In some embodiments,<br>
spacers 124 may extend from one or more of the feed plates and/or sealing plates<br>
that may be incorporated into a hydrogen-separation assembly. In some such<br>
embodiments, the spacers may be (but are not require to be) less than the full<br>
thickness of the associated plate. When used, spacers 124 do not extend across the<br>
entire thickness of the hydrogen-separation assembly so that they do not block the<br>
flow of permeate gas within the permeate region 34. The spacers extend from the<br>
hydrogen-separation assembly to, or toward, the inside perimeter of the internal<br>
enclosure, and in some embodiments may extend into contact with the internal<br>
enclosure.<br>
Additionally or alternatively, spacers that extend from the Inside perimeter 20<br>
of the internal enclosure are equally within the scope of the present disclosure, and<br>
like spacers 124 may aid in the positioning of the hydrogen-separation assembly<br>
within the enclosure and thereby maintain the spaced relation between the two. Any<br>
suitable mechanism, component, and/or structure for maintaining the spaced relation<br>
between at least a portion of the outer perimeter of the hydrogen-separation<br>
assembly and the inside perimeter of the body of the enclosure is within the scope of<br>
the present disclosure.<br>
An optional groove 126 may extend into the first body portion 22 of the<br>
enclosure, as illustrated in Fig. 6. Groove 126 may effectively enlarge the permeate<br>
region 34 and thereby aid in the flow of the permeate gas through gas passage 176<br>
&gt; and thus permeate region 34 to the product output port 46 by increasing the space<br>
between at least a portion of the outer perimeter of the hydrogen-separation<br><br>
assembly and at least a portion of the inside perimeter of the body. The groove,<br>
when present, may be described as defining at least a portion of a permeate gas<br>
passage through which permeate gas flows from the hydrogen-separation assembly<br>
to the product output port. As mentioned above, the relative size of the channel 176,<br>
and further the groove 126, may vary within the scope of the present disclosure from<br>
that depicted in Fig. 6 for the purpose of illustration.<br>
As illustrated in Figs. 5-11, and as perhaps best seen in Fig. 7, the various<br>
plates and gaskets that form a hydrogen-separation assembly according to the<br>
present disclosure, may be sized with asymmetrical shapes so that these<br>
components may only be located in the enclosure in a predetermined configuration.<br>
This is not required, but it may assist in assembly of the components because they<br>
cannot be inadvertently positioned in the housing in a backwards or upside-down<br>
configuration. In the Illustrative, non-exclusive example of a suitable asymmetrical<br>
shape, a corner region 128 of the hydrogen-separation assembly has a different<br>
shape than the other comer regions, with this difference being sufficient to permit that<br>
corner to be only inserted into one of the corresponding corner regions of the<br>
enclosure's internal volume. The non-exclusive example illustrated in Fig. 7<br>
incorporates a more squared-off corner than the other three corners of the hydrogen-<br>
separation assemblies illustrated herein, although any suitable shape of one or more<br>
corner regions that facilitate proper positioning of the hydrogen-separation, assembly<br>
within an enclosure are within the scope of the present disclosure. Additionally or<br>
alternatively, regions other than the corner regions may facilitate the same<br>
functionality. Accordingly, some enclosures according to the present disclosure may<br>
be described as being keyed, or indexed, to define the orientation of the gaskets,<br>
frames, supports and similar components that are stacked therein.<br>
As also best illustrated in Fig. 7, some hydrogen-separation assemblies and<br>
enclosures according to the present disclosure may be configured so that the spaced<br>
relation between the two does not extend around the entire perimeters thereof. For<br>
example, and as illustrated in Fig. 7, the components that define a hydrogen-<br>
separation assembly and/or other components that may be housed within an<br>
enclosure according to the present disclosure may include an end region 130 that is<br>
shaped so as to not provide (or to at least minimally provide) a channel or space<br>
between the end region 130 and the inside perimeter 20 of the enclosure body. Such<br>
a configuration, together with the optional spacers 124 discussed above and<br>
illustrated in Fig. 6, may thereby aid in the positioning and maintaining of the<br>
hydrogen-separation assembly (and/or other components) In a spaced relation to the<br><br>
inside perimeter of the body of the enclosure. Additionally or alternatively, such a<br>
configuration may aid in the directing of the permeate gas that enters the<br>
channel 176 from the harvesting regions of the membrane assemblies to the product<br>
output port of the enclosure. That is, because the hydrogen purification process<br>
according of the present disclosure is a pressure driven process, reducing the<br>
distance required that the permeate gas has to travel to exit the enclosure reduces<br>
the pressure drop associated therewith and thereby may provide for greater<br>
hydrogen flux, as discussed above.<br>
In Fig. 8, an illustrative, non-exclusive example of a suitable construction for a<br>
hydrogen-processing assembly 10 that includes a hydrogen-producing region 70 is<br>
shown in an unassembled, exploded condition, and is generally indicated at 120.<br>
Accordingly, in addition to the various components (and variants thereof) discussed<br>
above in regards to hydrogen-processing assembly 100 in Fig. 5, the hydrogen-<br>
processing assembly 120 illustrated in Fig. 7 further includes an input port 36 for<br>
receiving a feed stream 38 for delivery to hydrogen-producing region 70, and an<br>
access port 122 for loading and removing catalyst from the hydrogen-producing<br>
region. Assemblies. 120 according to the present disclosure are not required to<br>
include a catalyst access port. During use of illustrated assembly 120 to produce<br>
and/or purify hydrogen gas, access port 122 may be capped off or otherwise sealed.<br>
In Fig. 8, the second body portion 24 of assembly 120 is shown including an<br>
optional protrusion 123 that aligns generally with gas distribution conduit 140, and<br>
thereby may aid in the positioning of the hydrogen-separation assembly within the<br>
enclosure, in applying compression to the gas distribution conduits, and/or in<br>
maintaining the spaced relation between the hydrogen-separation assembly and the<br>
inside perimeter of the enclosure body. Second portion 24 may include more than<br>
one protrusion, or projecting rib, such as is illustrated in dashed lines at 123 to align<br>
generally with gas distribution conduit 170. In embodiments incorporating a<br>
protrusion 123, the protrusion may be configured to extend only far enough into the<br>
internal volume to properly align with the hydrogen-separation assembly and not<br>
prevent the flow of mixed-gas through conduit 140 to and/or from the membrane<br>
assemblies and/or other components.<br>
An illustrative, non-exclusive example of a suitable construction for a<br>
hydrogen-separation assembly 28 that may be used in either hydrogen-processing<br>
assembly 100 or 120 is shown in Fig. 9 and indicated at 154. As illustrated,<br>
assembly 154 includes a plurality of membrane assemblies 30 that include hydrogen-<br>
selective membranes 54. The illustrated assembly 28 includes a single-membrane<br><br>
assembly 88 and a double-membrane assembly 90. Also shown are various porous<br>
membrane supports, or screens, 162, that define the harvesting regions of the<br>
membrane assemblies. Membrane assemblies 30 include sealing gaskets 168 that<br>
extend proximate the membranes and screens, but not around the perimeters of the<br>
membranes and screens, to provide seals for the gas distribution conduits 140,170.<br>
Various sealing gaskets 202, 204, 206, 208, 210, and 212, feed plates 214,<br>
216, and sealing plate 218 are also provided. Plate 218 may also be referred to as a<br>
transition plate. In the illustrated example, the mixed gas region of the internal<br>
volume is at least partially defined by the internal spaces of the various sealing<br>
gaskets and feed plates and by the gas distribution conduits 140 and 170.<br>
Accordingly, in application, a mixed gas stream enters the mixed gas region via the<br>
internal space of sealing gasket 212. A portion of the mixed gas stream then travels<br>
into the conduit 140 via feed plate 216 to be distributed to the single-membrane<br>
assembly 88 and the near side (as viewed in Fig. 9) of the double-membrane<br>
assembly 90 to come into contact with the mixed gas surfaces of the hydrogen-<br>
selective membranes 54 via the feed plate 214 and sealing gaskets 204, 208, 210.<br>
The portion of the mixed gas stream that is not distributed via the gas conduit 170<br>
travels through feed passage 215 in feed plate 216 to come into contact with the<br>
mixed gas surface of the far (as viewed in Fig. ,9) hydrogen-selective membrane of<br>
double-membrane assembly 90. The portion of the mixed gas stream that does not<br>
pass through the hydrogen-selective membranes is pressure driven into gas<br>
conduit 170 via feed plate 214 to be expelled from the enclosure via the byproduct<br>
output port.<br>
The portion of the mixed gas stream that does pass through the hydrogen-<br>
selective membranes to form the hydrogen-rich, or permeate, stream flows into the<br>
permeate region of the internal volume via screens 162 of membrane assemblies 30.<br>
Thereafter the permeate stream may be removed from the enclosure through the<br>
product output port.<br>
Also illustrated in Fig. 9 are an optional catalyst retention plate 160 and<br>
sealing gasket 166 that may be used in hydrogen-processing assemblies according<br>
to the present disclosure that include a hydrogen-producing region 70, such as<br>
hydrogen-processing assembly 120 shown in Fig. 8 and discussed above. In<br>
application, the catalyst retention plate 160 retains the catalyst material within the<br>
hydrogen-producing region. Feed stream 38 enters hydrogen-producing region 70 via<br>
input port 36, and percolates through the catalyst material to form the mixed gas<br>
stream, which in the illustrated example of Fig. 9, enters the mixed gas region via<br><br>
slits or other apertures 167 in the retention plate. The mixed gas then travels through<br>
the hydrogen-separation assembly, as discussed above, to form both the permeate<br>
stream and the byproduct stream.<br>
In Fig. 10, another illustrative, non-exclusive example of a suitable<br>
construction for a hydrogen-processing assembly 10 that does not include a<br>
hydrogen-producing region is shown in an unassembled, exploded condition, and is<br>
generally indicated at 180. Assembly 180 includes an optional hydrogen-polishing<br>
region 182 that further purifies the permeate stream subsequent to being formed by<br>
the hydrogen-separation assembly 28. In the illustrated example, the hydrogen-<br>
polishing region incorporates a methanation catalyst, or methanation catalyst<br>
bed, 185 within the enclosure and held in place between a catalyst support plate 184,<br>
which may take the form of a compressible pad or support, and the inside surface of<br>
the enclosure adjacent the product output port 46. As illustrated, an additional<br>
support plate 186, which may take the form of a screen, may also be provided to<br>
generally prevent the catalyst material from being expunged through the product<br>
output port along with the purified hydrogen. Accordingly, plate 186 may include one<br>
or more apertures, or holes, that permit the purified hydrogen to pass, while retaining<br>
the catalyst bed within the polishing region 182. In the illustrated example of Fig. 10,<br>
the permeate stream, upon exiting the hydrogen-separation assembly, enters the<br>
permeate region defined by the outer perimeter 60 of the hydrogen-separation<br>
assembly and the inside perimeter 20 of the enclosure body, and is pressure driven<br>
into the hydrogen-polishing region, where, as described in more detail herein,<br>
compositions that may be harmful to downstream components of a fuel cell system,<br>
such as carbon monoxide for example, may be removed by the catalyst bed.<br>
An illustrative, non-exclusive example of a suitable construction for a<br>
hydrogen-separation assembly 28 that may be used in hydrogen-processing<br>
assembly 180 is shown in Fig. 11, and indicated at 188. Like hydrogen-separation<br>
assembly 154 illustrated in Fig. 9, assembly 188 includes a plurality of membrane<br>
assemblies 30 that include hydrogen-selective membranes 54. Assembly 188<br>
includes a single-membrane assembly 88 and a double-membrane assembly 90,<br>
both including porous membrane supports, or screens, 162, that define the<br>
harvesting regions of the membrane assemblies. As discussed, the number and type<br>
of membrane assemblies in separation assemblies according to the present<br>
disclosure may vary, including more or less membrane assemblies than are shown in<br>
the illustrated graphical examples. The membrane assemblies shown in Fig. 11<br>
further include sealing gaskets 168 that extend proximate the membranes and<br><br>
screens, but not around the perimeters of the membranes and screens, to provide<br>
seals for the gas distribution conduits 190,192,194 that define a portion of the mixed<br>
gas region of the assembly.<br>
Various sealing gaskets 402, 404, 406, 408, 410, and 412, feed plates 414,<br>
416, and sealing plate, or transition feed plate, 418 are also provided. In the<br>
illustrated example, the mixed gas region of the internal volume is at least partially<br>
defined by the internal spaces of the various sealing gaskets and feed plates and by<br>
the gas distribution conduits 190, 192, and 194. As indicated, sealing plate 418 does<br>
not include a conduit passage on one end, thereby effectively separating gas<br>
conduits 190 and 194. Accordingly, in application, a mixed gas stream first enters the<br>
mixed gas region through gas conduit 190. The mixed gas stream then travels into<br>
the internal space of gasket 404 via feed passages 215 in feed plate 414, where it<br>
comes into contact with the mixed gas surface of the near (as viewed in Fig. 11)<br>
hydrogen-selective membrane 54 of the double-membrane assembly 90. The portion<br>
of the mixed gas stream that does not pass through the near membrane, travels into<br>
gas conduit 192 via feed plate 414 where it is then distributed to the internal space of<br>
gaskets 406, 408, 410, and sealing plate 418 to come into contact with the mixed gas<br>
surface of the far (as viewed in Fig. 11) membrane 54 of double-membrane<br>
assembly 90 and the membrane 54 of the single-membrane assembly 88. The<br>
portion of the mixed gas stream that does not pass through any of the membranes 54<br>
is pressure driven into gas conduit 194 via feed plate 416 to be expelled from the<br>
enclosure as a byproduct stream via the byproduct output port of the enclosure.<br>
The portion of the mixed gas stream that does pass through the hydrogen-<br>
selective membranes to form the hydrogen-rich or permeate stream, flows into the<br>
permeate region of the internal volume via screens 162 of membrane assemblies 30.<br>
Thereafter the permeate stream may be removed from the enclosure through the<br>
product output port. As discussed above, when hydrogen-separation assembly 188 is<br>
incorporated into hydrogen-processing assembly 180 illustrated in Fig. 10, the<br>
permeate stream is further purified in the hydrogen-polishing region, prior to exiting<br>
the enclosure via product output port 46.<br>
During fabrication of the membrane assemblies and hydrogen-separation<br>
assemblies 28 of the present disclosure, adhesive may (but is not required to) be<br>
used to secure the membranes 54 to the screen structures 162 and/or to secure the<br>
components of the screen structures, as discussed in more detail in U.S. Patent<br>
No. 6,319,306, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated for all purposes.<br>
An example of a suitable adhesive is sold by 3M under the trade name SUPER 77.<br><br>
The adhesive may be at least substantially, if not completely, removed after<br>
fabrication of the membrane assembly so as not to interfere with the permeability,<br>
selectivity and flow paths of the gases. An example of a suitable method for removing<br>
adhesive from the membranes and/or screen structures or other supports is by<br>
exposure to oxidizing conditions prior to initial operation of assembly 10. The<br>
objective of the oxidative conditioning is to burn out the adhesive without excessively<br>
oxidizing the membrane. A suitable procedure for such oxidizing is disclosed in U.S.<br>
Patent No. 6,319,306.<br>
It is also within the scope of the present disclosure that the screen members,<br>
when utilized, may be otherwise secured together, such as by sintering, welding,<br>
brazing, diffusion bonding and/or with a mechanical fastener. It is also within the<br>
scope of the present disclosure that the screen members, when utilized, may not be<br>
coupled together other than by being compressed together in the hydrogen-<br>
separation assembly of a hydrogen-processing assembly. Screens 162 may (but are<br>
not required to) include a coating on the surfaces that engage the permeate surfaces<br>
of membranes 54. Examples of suitable coatings are disclosed in U.S. Patent<br>
No. 6,569,227, incorporated above.<br>
Other examples of attachment mechanisms that achieve gas-tight seals<br>
between the various components forming membrane assemblies 30 and hydrogen-<br>
separation assemblies 28 include one or more of brazing, gasketing, and welding.<br>
It is within the scope of the present disclosure that the various gaskets,<br>
plates, and/or other components of membrane assemblies and/or hydrogen-<br>
separation assemblies discussed herein do not all need to be formed from the same<br>
materials and/or do not necessarily have the same dimensions, such as the same<br>
thicknesses. For example, illustrative, non-exclusive examples of suitable gaskets<br>
that may be used are flexible graphite gaskets, including those sold under the trade<br>
name GRAFOIL™ by Union Carbide, although other materials may be used, such as<br>
depending upon the operating conditions under which an assembly 10 is used.<br>
Various structural components may be formed from stainless steel or one or more<br>
other suitable structural materials discussed in the above-incorporated patents and<br>
applications.<br>
An illustrative, non-exclusive example of a hydrogen-processing assembly 10<br>
that is adapted to receive mixed gas stream 40 from a source of hydrogen gas to be<br>
purified is schematically illustrated in Fig. 12. As shown, illustrative, non-exclusive<br>
examples of hydrogen sources are indicated generally at 302 and include a<br>
hydrogen-producing fuel processor 300 and a hydrogen storage device 306. In<br><br>
Fig. 12, a fuel processor is generally indicated at 300, and the combination of a fuel<br>
processor and a hydrogen-purification device, or hydrogen-processing assembly 10,<br>
may be referred to as a hydrogen-producing fuel-processing system 303. Also shown<br>
in dashed lines at 304 is a heating assembly, which may be provided to provide heat<br>
to assembly 10 and may take a variety of forms. Fuel processor 300 may take any<br>
suitable form including, but not limited to, the various forms of hydrogen-producing<br>
region 70 discussed above. The schematic representation of fuel processor 300 in<br>
Fig. 12 is meant to include any associated heating assemblies, feedstock delivery<br>
systems, air delivery systems, feed stream sources or supplies, etc. Illustrative, non-<br>
exclusive examples of suitable hydrogen storage devices 306 include hydride beds<br>
and pressurized tanks.<br>
Fuel processors are often operated at elevated temperatures and/or<br>
pressures. As a result, it may be desirable to at least partially integrate hydrogen-<br>
processing assembly 10 with fuel processor 300, as opposed to having assembly 10<br>
and fuel processor 300 connected by external fluid transportation conduits. An<br>
example of such a configuration is shown in Fig. 13, in which the fuel processor<br>
includes a shell or housing 312, which device 10 forms a portion of and/or extends at<br>
least partially within. In such a configuration, fuel processor 300 may be described as<br>
including device 10. Integrating the fuel processor or other source of mixed gas<br>
stream 40 with hydrogen-processing assembly 10 enables the devices to be more<br>
easily moved as a unit. It also enables the fuel processing system's components,<br>
including assembly 10, to be heated by a common heating assembly and/or for at<br>
least some, if not all, of the heating requirements of assembly 10 to be satisfied by<br>
heat generated by processor 300.<br>
As discussed, fuel processor 300 is any suitable device that produces a<br>
mixed gas stream containing hydrogen gas, and preferably a mixed gas stream that<br>
contains a majority of hydrogen gas. For purposes of illustration, the following<br>
discussion will describe fuel processor 300 as being adapted to receive a feed<br>
stream 316 containing a carbon-containing feedstock 318 and water 320, as shown<br>
in Fig. 14. However, it is within the scope of the present disclosure that the fuel<br>
processor 300 may take other forms, and that feed stream 316 may have other<br>
compositions, such as containing only a carbon-containing feedstock or only water.<br>
Feed stream 316 may be delivered to fuel processor 300 via any suitable<br>
mechanism. A single feed stream 316 is shown in Fig. 14, but it should be<br>
understood that more than one stream 316 may be used and that these streams may<br>
contain the same or different components. When the carbon-containing<br><br>
feedstock 318 is miscible with water, the feedstock may be delivered with the water<br>
component of feed stream 316, such as shown in Fig. 14. When the carbon-<br>
containing feedstock is immiscible or only slightly miscible with water, these<br>
components may be delivered to fuel processor 300 in separate streams, such as<br>
shown in dashed lines in Fig. 14. In Fig. 14, feed stream 316 is shown being<br>
delivered to fuel processor 300 by a feed stream delivery system 317. Delivery<br>
system 317 includes any suitable mechanism, device, or combination thereof that<br>
delivers the feed stream to fuel processor 300. For example, the delivery system may<br>
include one or more pumps that deliver the components of stream 316 from a supply.<br>
Additionally or alternatively, delivery system 317 may include a valve assembly<br>
adapted to regulate the flow of the components from a pressurized supply. The<br>
supplies may be located external the fuel cell system, or may be contained within or<br>
adjacent the system.<br>
As generally indicated at 332 in Fig. 14, fuel processor 300 includes a<br>
hydrogen-producing region in which mixed gas stream 40 is produced from feed<br>
stream 316. As discussed, a variety of different processes may be utilized in the<br>
hydrogen-producing region. An example of such a process is steam reforming, in<br>
which region 332 includes a steam reforming catalyst 334. As discussed, other<br>
hydrogen-producing mechanisms may be utilized without departing from the scope of<br>
the present disclosure. As discussed, in the context of a steam or autothermal<br>
reformer, mixed gas stream 40 may also be referred to as a reformate stream. The<br>
fuel processor may be adapted to produce substantially pure hydrogen gas, or even<br>
pure hydrogen gas. For the purposes of the present disclosure, substantially pure<br>
hydrogen gas may be greater than 90% pure, greater than 95% pure, greater<br>
than 99% pure, greater than 99.5% pure, or greater than 99.9% pure. Illustrative,<br>
non-exclusive examples of suitable fuel processors are disclosed in U.S. Patent<br>
Nos. 6,221,117 and 6,319,306, incorporated above, and U.S. Patent Application<br>
Publication No. 2001/0045061, the complete disclosure of which is hereby<br>
incorporated by reference In its entirety for all purposes.<br>
Fuel processor 300 may, but does not necessarily, further include a polishing<br>
region 348, such as shown in Fig. 14. Polishing region 348 receives hydrogen-rich<br>
stream 48 from assembly 10 and further purifies the stream by reducing the<br>
concentration of, or removing, selected compositions therein. In Fig. 14, the resulting<br>
stream is indicated at 314 and may be referred to as a product hydrogen stream or<br>
purified hydrogen stream. When fuel processor 300 does not include polishing<br>
region 348, hydrogen-rich stream 48 forms product hydrogen stream 314. For<br><br>
example, when stream 48 is intended for use in a fuel cell stack, compositions that<br>
may damage the fuel cell stack, such as carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, may<br>
be removed from the hydrogen-rich stream, if necessary. The concentration of<br>
carbon monoxide may be less than 10 ppm (parts per million) to prevent the control<br>
system from isolating the fuel cell stack. For example, the system may limit the<br>
concentration of carbon monoxide to less than 5 ppm, or even less than 1 ppm. The<br>
concentration of carbon dioxide may be greater than that of carbon monoxide. For<br>
example, concentrations of less than 25% carbon dioxide may be acceptable. For<br>
example, the concentration of carbon dioxide may be less than 10%, or even less<br>
than 1%. Concentrations of carbon dioxide may be less than 50 ppm. It should be<br>
understood that the concentrations presented herein are illustrative examples, and<br>
that concentrations other than those presented herein may be used and are within<br>
the scope of the present disclosure. For example, particular users or manufacturers<br>
may require minimum or maximum concentration levels or ranges that are different<br>
than those identified herein.<br>
Region 348 includes any suitable structure for removing or reducing the<br>
concentration of the selected compositions in stream 48. For example, when the<br>
product stream is intended for use in a proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell<br>
stack or other device that will be damaged if the stream contains more than<br>
determined concentrations of carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide, it may be desirable<br>
to include at least one methanation catalyst bed 350. Bed 350 converts carbon<br>
monoxide and carbon dioxide into methane and water, both of which will not damage<br>
a PEM fuel cell stack. Polishing region 348 may also include another hydrogen-<br>
producing region 352, such as another reforming catalyst bed, to convert any<br>
unreacted feedstock into hydrogen gas. In such an embodiment, the second<br>
reforming catalyst bed may be upstream from the methanation catalyst bed so as not<br>
to reintroduce carbon dioxide or carbon monoxide downstream of the methanation<br>
catalyst bed.<br>
Steam reformers typically operate at temperatures in the range of 200° C and<br>
900° C, and at pressures in the range of 50 psi and 1000 psi, although temperatures<br>
outside of this range are within the scope of the present disclosure, such as<br>
depending upon the particular type and configuration of fuel processor being used.<br>
Any suitable heating mechanism or device may be used to provide this heat, such as<br>
a heater, burner, combustion catalyst, or the like. The heating assembly may be<br>
external the fuel processor or may form a combustion chamber that forms part of the<br><br>
fuel processor. The fuel for the heating assembly may be provided by the fuel-<br>
processing or fuel cell system, by an external source, or both.<br>
In Fig. 14, fuel processor 300 is shown including a shell 312 in which the<br>
above-described components are contained. Shell 312, which also may be referred<br>
to as a housing, enables the components of the fuel processor to be moved as a unit.<br>
It also protects the components of the fuel processor from damage by providing a<br>
protective enclosure and reduces the heating demand of the fuel processor because<br>
the components of the fuel processor may be heated as a unit. Shell 312 may, but<br>
does not necessarily, include insulating material 333, such as a solid insulating<br>
material, blanket insulating material, or an air-filled cavity. It is within the scope of the<br>
present disclosure, however, that the fuel processor may be formed without a<br>
housing or shell. When fuel processor 300 includes insulating material 333, the<br>
insulating material may be internal the shell, external the shell, or both. When the<br>
insulating material is external a shell containing the above-described reforming,<br>
separation and/or polishing regions, the fuel processor may further include an outer<br>
cover or jacket external the insulation.<br>
It is further within the scope of the present disclosure that one or more of the<br>
components of fuel processor 300 may either extend beyond the shell or be located<br>
external at least shell 312. For example, assembly 10 may extend at least partially<br>
beyond shell 312, as indicated in Fig. 13. As another example, and as schematically<br>
illustrated in Fig. 14, polishing region 348 may be external of shell 312 and/or a<br>
portion of hydrogen-producing region 332 (such as portions of one or more reforming<br>
catalyst beds) may extend beyond the shell.<br>
As indicated above, fuel processor 300 may be adapted to deliver hydrogen-<br>
rich stream 48 or product hydrogen stream 314 to at least one fuel cell stack, which<br>
produces an electric current therefrom. In such a configuration, the fuel processor<br>
and fuel cell stack may be referred to as a fuel cell system. An example of such a<br>
system is schematically illustrated in Fig. 15, in which a fuel cell stack is generally<br>
indicated at 322. The fuel cell stack is adapted to produce an electric current from the<br>
portion of product hydrogen stream 314 delivered thereto. In the illustrated<br>
embodiment, a single fuel processor 300 and a single fuel cell stack 322 are shown<br>
and described, however, more than one of either or both of these components may<br>
be used. It should be understood that these components have been schematically<br>
illustrated and that the fuel cell system may include additional components that are<br>
not specifically illustrated in the figures, such as feed pumps, air delivery systems,<br>
heat exchangers, heating assemblies and the like.<br><br>
Fuel cell stack 322 contains at least one, and typically multiple, fuel cells 324<br>
that are adapted to produce an electric current from the portion of the product<br>
hydrogen stream 314 delivered thereto. This electric current may be used to satisfy<br>
the energy demands, or applied load, of an associated energy-consuming<br>
device 325. Illustrative examples of devices 325 include, but should not be limited to,<br>
a motor vehicle, recreational vehicle, boat, tools, lights or lighting assemblies,<br>
appliances (such as a household or other appliance), household, signaling or<br>
communication equipment, etc. It should be understood that device 325 is<br>
schematically illustrated in Fig. 15 and is meant to represent one or more devices or<br>
collection of devices that are adapted to draw electric current from the fuel cell<br>
system. A fuel cell stack typically includes multiple fuel cells joined together between<br>
common end plates 323, which contain fluid delivery/removal conduits (not shown).<br>
Examples of suitable fuel cells include PEM fuel cells and alkaline fuel cells. Fuel cell<br>
stack 322 may receive all of product hydrogen stream 314. Some or all of stream 314<br>
may additionally, or alternatively, be delivered, via a suitable conduit, for use in<br>
another hydrogen-consuming process, burned for fuel or heat, or stored for later use.<br>

processing assemblies, fuel cell systems, and components thereof, is applicable to<br>
