A METHOD FOR THE PREPARATION OF ENANTiOMERICALLY PURE MIRTAZAPINE<br>
The present invention relates to a method for the preparation of enantiomerically pure mirtazapine comprising ring closure with an acid.<br><br>
The compound is chiral and the racemic mixture finds widespread use as a medicine for the treatment of depression. Other medical uses for mirtazapine have also been reported e.g., WO 99/25356 and WO 01/58453 disclose its use In the treatment of sleep disorders and apnea, investigations into the biological effects of the enantiomers of mirtazapine (e.g. O'Connor and Leonard, Neuropharmacology, 1986, vol. 25, pp. 267-270; Kooyman et ai., 1994, vol. 33, pp. 501-507; De Boer et aA, Neuropharmacology, 1988, vol. 27, pp. 399-408; Gower et al., 1988, vol. 291, pp 185-201) invoke the use of the compound in its pure enantiomeric forms, which opens the need for efficient production of large quantities of enantiomerically pure mirtazapine. The present invention provides for improvement in such a production method.<br>
A variety of methods are known in the art for the preparation of mirtazapine. US 4062848 describes variations within a four stage synthetic scheme by which the synthesis of mirtazapine can be accomplished starting from a 2-substituted nicotinitriie. Further modifications to various stages of this route have subsequently been described in WO 00/62782, WO 01/23345 and US 6,376,668.<br>
The preparation of enantiomerically pure mirtazapine has been addressed in US 4062848, WO 00/62782 and Selditz et a/., 1998 (J. Chromatography, 1998, vol 803, pp 169-177). By the method disclosed in US 4062848, enantiomerically pure mirtazapine is obtained by fractional crystallisation of the diastereoisomeric salts formed by reaction of racemic mirtazapine with enantiomerically pure dibenzoyitartaric acid in ethanol followed<br><br>
by regeneration of the free base by treatment with aqueous ammonia. Other methods of forming pure mirtazapine by recrystallisation of caude mirtazapine are disclosed in WO 00/62782. Selditz et el describe a chromatographic method to separate the enantiomers. In these methods resolution occurs at the end of the synthetic pathway leading to the generation of a racemic mixture of mirtazapine. It follows therefore that the overall yield of each enantiomerically pure compound obtained Is relatively low and can never be more than 50%. It would be beneficial to have a more economic method in which enantiomerically pure mirtazapine could be prepared with an overall improved yield.<br>
According to the method described in US 4062848 mirtazapine can be obtained as a result of ring closure of a compound of formula (11),<br><br>
wherein X can represent a leaving group, such as a hydroxyl group, an esterified or Gtherified hydroxyl group or a halogen, using a variety of ring closing reagents. Examples of such reagents include acids such as sulfuric acid, concentrated hydrochloric acid, picric acid, trifluoroacetic acid, phosphoric acid, polyphosphoric acid (PPA), phosphoais oxychloride, phosphorus trioxide, phosphorus pentoxide and Lewis Acids such as aluminium chloride, ferric chloride, zinc chloride, tin chloride, titanium chloride, boron trifluoride, antimony pentachloride and zirconium tetrachloride. In US 4062848 preparation of mirtazapine is exemplified by ring closure using concentrated sulfuric acid. In WO 00/62782 it is indicated that concentrated sulfuric acid is most preferred. In US 4062848 a remark is made that pure enantiomers of mirtazapine might be obtained synthetically by using enantiomerically pure starting material for the last ring closure step. However, the method described in WO 00/62782 with concentrated sulfuric acid does not sufficiently retain optical purity. Apparently, those reaction conditions allow excessive racemisation.<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that for the synthesis of enantiomerically pure mirtazapine by ring closure of an enantiomerically pure compound of formula (II),<br><br>
stereochemical integrity in the starting material can nevertheless be preserved by making a specific selection out of the above mentioned ring closing reagents.<br>
The present invention therefore provides a method comprising a step of ring closure of a compound according to formula {II), wherein X is a leaving group, said step comprising treatment, wherein mirtazapine with enantiomeric excess Is formed by the ring closure of the compound of formula (II) with enantiomeric excess by treatment with a suitable acid in the absence of a solvent or a suitable combination of an acid and an organic solvent The alcohol according to formula II is preferably used as crystalline salt or solvate, such as the oxalate salt of (S) or (R) 1-{3-hydroxymethyl-2-pyridyl)-4-methyl-2-phenylpiperazine. Optionally, dicaiite is added to the reaction mixture to prevent lump formation.<br>
The term mirtazapine is used here in its generic meaning commonly used to refer to the chemical compound as a base and, depending on the context, to the salts and solvates thereof and supplemented with the prefixes (R) or (S) and/or (+) or {-) to the enantiomers of the compound. The (S) configuration causes positive optical rotation in the usual solvents.<br>
The term enantiomeric excess in a compound refers to the difference between the amounts of each of the enantiomers present in a mixture, relative to the total amount of the compound in the mixtur expressed as percentage. For example, in a 10 g mixture containing 9 g mirtazapine (90%), of which 4 g is (R)-mirtazapine and 5 g is (S)-mirtazapine the enantiomeric excess of the (S)-enantiomer is about 11%. In an abbreviated manner the term mirtazapine or compound with enantiomeric excess refers to a mixture containing the mirtazapine or the compound with enantiomeric excess.<br>
The invention can provide enantiomerically pure mirtazapine if enantiomerically pure starting material is used and the ring closure is effected by treatment with a suitable acid in the absence of a solvent or a suitable combination of an acid and an organic solvent.<br>
Enantiomerically pure compound is one comprising less than 20 % of the other enantiomer, which is an enantiomeric excess of 60 %. Depending on the specific conditions of the invented method an enantiomerically pure compound having less than 10 % of the other enantiomer or less than 1 % of the other enantiomer can also be obtained. The yields of enantiomerically pure mirtazapine isolated are typically not less than 50 % but yields of not less than 70 % can also be obtained.<br><br>
A leaving group is a reactive function on a molecule whichi undergoes displacement from the molecule when a new bond Is formed, as is commonly known in the art. More specificaliy a leaving group can be a hydroxy! group, an activated ester thereof, such as a carboxylate, a sulfonate or a phosphonate, or a halogen. Groups with this function are commonly known In the art and the list can be further expanded by consultation of commonly available handbooks for organic synthesis.<br>
A suitable acid for the method of the present invention Is defined to be a specific acid or acid/solvent combination as mentioned hereafter or an acid or acid/solvent combination not mentioned hereafter, but which is obtained by performing a test as to the suitability of the acid. The test is to perform the ring closure with an acid, being a candidate acid, and starting material, which is compound II as defined above, or a salt or solvate thereof, in a predetermined enantiomeric purity, and determine after the reaction the enantiomeric excess of the resulting mirtazapine. The quantitative degree of loss of enantiomeric purity can be determined by simple calculation and expressed as difference between enantiomeric excess in the starting material before the reaction and the enantiomeric excess of the product mirtazapine after the reaction. If the loss is less than 40% the acid or acid/solvent combination is a suitable acid or acid/solvent combination. A more strict criterion for a suitable acid or acid/solvent combination can be applied by selecting those causing a loss less than a number anywhere between 0% and 40%, such as 35%, 30%, 25%, 20%, 15%, 10%, 5%, 2%, 1%, 0.5% and 0.3%. It is therefore an aspect of the invention to provide a method for the selection of an acid or acid/solvent combination suitable for the stereospecific ring closure leading to enantiomerically pure mirtazapine. The method comprises performing the ring closure reaction of an enantiomerically pure compound according to the formula II, or a salt or solvate thereof, with the meaning of X, as defined previously with any candidate acid or any candidate acid/solvent combination and determining a loss of enantiomeric excess by the reaction and identifying an acid or an acid/solvent combination, as suitable if rt results in the loss of less than 40%. Optionally, a stricter criterion, as mentioned above can be applied for more suitable acids or acid/solvent combinations.<br>
A suitable acid used in the absence of solvent can be a protic acid or a protic acid derivative such as a protic acid anhydride. Concentrated sulfuric acid, the prior art method of choice for the preparation of racemic mirtazapine, or aluminium trichloride is not suitable.<br><br>
For ring closure using a suitable acid in the absence of solvent, the use of polyphosphoric acid or phosphonjs pentoxide in phosphoric acid are particularly preferred. It is recommended to use polyphosphoric acid, or phosphorus pentoxide in phosphoric acid, in an amount of low excess over the starting alcohol defined as compound II above. The reaction will give better yield and better retention of enantiomeric excess if the ratio (w/w) of polyphosphoric acid over the alcohol (weight of base of compound II) is less than 10 to 1 (w/w), or better 5 to 1, even better if less than 2.5 to 1. When polyphosphoric acid is introduced in amounts of pentoxide and phosphoric acid (possibly in weight (w/w) ratio of pentoxide over phosphoric acid of 1:1 to 1:9) the weights of phosphorus pentoxide and phosphoric acid are added up to express as the total amount of polyphosphoric acid.<br>
A suitable acid and organic solvent combination can be a combination of a protic acid or a protic acid derivative such as a protic acid anhydride or a mineral acid and a polar coordinating solvent such as ethanol or higher alcohols, DMF, DMA or N-methylpyrrolidinone. More preferrd is to use the combination of a protic acid derivative and N-methylpyrrolid!none or DMF. Polyphosphoric acid and N-methylpyrrolidinone or DMF are particularly preferred.<br>
The acid/solvent combinations phosphorus pentoxide or polyphosphoric acid or sulfuric acid and xylene; phosphorus pentoxide or polyphosphoric acid and chlorobenzene; phosphorus pentoxide or polyphosphoric acid and toluene, and sulfuric acid and dichioromethane are not suitable.<br>
Whilst the ring closure reaction can take place at room temperature, the reaction can also be facilitated with additional heating. It is a further aspect of the invention therefore to include ring closure according to the methods of the present invention including additional<br>
heating.<br>
A compound of formula (II) can be prepared by the synthetic route shown in Scheme 1 which is described in US 4062848.<br><br><br>
Thus, compound (V) can be prepared by reaction of compound (IV) with chloronicotinitrile (III) In an organic solvent, such as tetrahydrofuran or dimethylformamide and in the presence of an equivalent of a base such as potassium fluoride. Compound (VI) can then be prepared by hydrolysis of compound (V) using an aqueous base such as potassium hydroxide in an alcohol such as ethanol, typically at reflux. In WO 00/62782, it is described that the molar ratio of the base used to effectuate the nitrile hydrolysis can be reduced from 25 moles of base (as disclosed in the procedure of US patent 4062848) to around 12 moles of base. Finally compound (II) can be prepared by reduction of compound (VI) again using a metal hydride such as lithium aluminium hydride in an organic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran. Conversion of the alcohol functjon to other leaving groups such as carboxylate and sulphonate esters and to halogens can be readily achieved by methods which are well known in the art.<br>
Preparation of enantiomerically pure compound (II) can then be achieved by using methods well known in the art. For example, asymmetric synthesis methods e.g., synthesis with chiral Induction, fractional crystallisation of diastereoisomeric salts formed upon reaction with a chiral acid or separation by chromatography on a chiral medium by normal or reverse phase chromatographic methods. Such methods are for example described in 'Chirality in Industry' (edited by A.N. Collins, G.N. Sheldrake and J. Crosby, 1992; John Wiley)<br><br>
The invention also includes enantiomerically pure mlrtazapine produced by the method of the present invention and pharmaceutical compositions of such for use in therapy. Such compositions can comprise a therapeutically effective amount of enantiomerically pure mirtazapine in combination with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and excipients which are well known in the art.<br>
