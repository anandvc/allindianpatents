[0001] This application is related to U.S. provisional application 60/564,151, filed<br>
20 April 2004. The contents of this document are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Technical Field<br>
[0002] The invention relates to organosulfur compounds and methods of using thereof.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0003] Cancer remains one of the most important unmet medical challenges to mankind. A<br>
number of options for treating tumors are available, including surgery, radiation, chemotherapy,<br>
or any combination of these approaches. Among these, chemotherapy is widely used for all<br>
types of cancers, in particular for those inoperable or with metastatic characteristics. Despite a<br>
variety of chemotherapeutic compounds being used in clinics, chemotherapy is generally not<br>
curative, but only delays disease progression. Commonly, tumors and their metastasis become<br>
refractory to chemotherapy, as the tumor cells develop the ability of multidrug resistance. In<br>
some cases, the tumors are inherently resistant to some classes of chemotherapeutic agents. In<br>
other cases, the acquired resistance against chemotherapeutic agents is developed during the<br>
chemotherapeutic intervention. Thus, there remain significant limitations to the efficacy of<br>
available chemotherapeutic compounds in treating different classes of tumors. Furthermore,<br>
many cytotoxic and cytostatic agents used for chemotherapeutic treatment of tumors have severe<br>
side effects, resulting in termination of the chemotherapy in some patients. Thus, there remains<br>
a need for new chemotherapeutic agents.<br>
[0004] Dibenzyl bisulfide (DBTS) is a biologically active polysulfide secondary metabolite<br>
that was isolated from the sub-tropical shrub, Petiveria alliacea L. (Phytolaccaceae). It has been<br>
reported that DBTS has immunomodulatory activities ("Immunomodulatory activities of<br>
Petiveria alliacea", by Williams, L. A. D., Gardner, T. L., Fletcher, C. K., Naravane, A., Gibbs,<br>
N. and Fleischhacker, R. Phytother. Res., 1997,11, 251-253; "A sulfonic anhydride derivative<br>
from dibenzyl trisulphide with agro-chemical activities", by Williams, L. A. D., Vasqaez, E.,<br><br>
Klaiber, I., Kraus, W. and Rosner, H. Chemosphere, 2003, 51, 701-706). In investigating the<br>
cellular and molecular mechanisms of DBTS for its immunomodulatory activity, Rosner and co-<br>
workers reported that DBTS preferentially binds to an aromatic region of bovine serum albumin<br>
and attenuates the dephosphorylation of tyrosyl residues of MAP kinase (erkl/erk2) in SH-<br>
SY5Y neuroblastoma cells (in "Disassembly of microtubules and inhibition of neurite<br>
outgrowth, neuroblastoma cell proliferation, and MAP kinase tyrosine dephosphorylation by<br>
dibenzyl trisulphide", by Rosner, H., Williams, L. A. D., Jung, A. and Kraus, W. Biochim.<br>
Biophy. Acta, 2001, 1540, 166-177). In addition, they reported that DBTS causes a reversible<br>
disassembly of microtubules and did not affect actin dynamics in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells<br>
and in Wistar 38 human lung fibroblasts. Furthermore, they reported that DBTS also inhibits<br>
neuroblastoma cell proliferation and neurite outgrowth from spinal cord explants.<br>
[0005] In a different study, Mata-Greenwood and co-workers tested the antiproliferative and<br>
differentiating activity of a large set of extracts derived from various plants ("Discovery of novel<br>
inducers of cellular differentiation using HL-60 promyeolocytic cells", by Mata-Greenwood, E.,<br>
Ito A., Westernburg, H., Cui, B., Mehta, R. G., Kinghorn, A. D. and Pezzuto, J. M. Anticancer<br>
Res. 2001, 21,1763-1770). They reported that the lipophilic extract of the roots ofPetiveria<br>
alliacea L., and the active fraction from the lipophilic extract showed antiproliferative and<br>
differentiating activity in HL-60 promyelocytic cells. From the active fraction of the lipophilic<br>
extract, they isolated two active organosulfur compounds, i.e., 2-[(phenylmethyl)dithio]ethanol<br>
and dibenzyl trisulfide. They reported that these two organosulfur compounds induced<br>
monocyte-like differentiation and strong cytotoxicity. Furthermore, they reported that none of<br>
these two isolates demonstrated antiproliferative activity in HL-60 cells.<br>

B. Substituted Organo Sulfur Derivatives and Pharmaceutical Compositions<br>
Thereof<br>
[0089] The present invention compounds having formula<br><br>
wherein A and B are the same or different, and are independently an optionally<br>
substituted aryl, heteroaryl, or a 5-14 membered ring which may be monocyclic or multicyclic<br>
and optionally containing a heteroatom;<br>
each S is optionally in the form of an oxide;<br>

substituent, SR1, OR1 or R1, wherein each R1 is alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, aryl, heteroaryl, a<br>
carbocyclic ring or a heterocyclic ring, each of which is optionally substituted and may contain a<br>
heteroatom;<br>

or a compound having formula (3) or (4):<br><br>
wherein A, B, R, S, n and p are as defined above;<br>
or a compound having formula (5):<br><br><br>
wherein A, B, S, n and p are as defined above; and<br>
Z is (CR^q or (CR'^CR1),* wherein q is 0-3 and the * represents that C=C maybe<br>
replaced with alkynyl, O, S, NR; or Z is an optionally substituted aryl, heteroaryl or heterocyclic<br>
ring;<br>
wherein A and B together may form a cyclic ring system;<br>
and a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester, prodrug or metabolite thereof;<br>

diphenyltrisulfide, or di(p-t-butylphenyl)trisulfide.<br>
[0090] In other embodiments, each R in the above formula 1-5 may be a non-interfering<br>
substituent. In general, a "noninterfering substituent" is a substituent whose presence does not<br>
destroy the ability of a compound to behave as a therapeutic agent. For example, a non-<br>
interfering substituent may improve potency and PK properties. In another example, the non-<br>
interfering substituent may reduce toxicity. Suitable noninterfering substituents include halo,<br>
nitro, carboxyl, alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, aryl, arylalkyl, arylalkenyl, alkoxy, alkylthio,<br>
arylalkynyl, heterocycles, amino acids, each of which may further be substituted with one or<br>

substituent. In other examples, each Ri, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7 may be a nucleophilic or<br>
electrophilic non-interfering substituent<br>
[0093] The present invention also encompasses compounds having formula 1-5, as well as<br>
their salts and prodrugs. Such salts, for example, may be formed from a positively charged<br>
substitute group (e.g. an amino group on A and / or B) on a compound and a pharmaceutically<br>
suitable anion. Suitable anions include, but not limited to, chloride, bromide, iodide, sulfate,<br>
nitrate, phosphate, citrate, methanesulfonate, trifluoroacetate, maleate, and acetate.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts may also be formed from a negatively charged substituted<br>
group (e.g., carboxylate group on A and / or B) on a compound and a cation. Non-limiting<br>
examples of suitable cations are sodium ion, potassium ion, magnesium ion, calcium ion, and a<br>
organic ammonium ion such as teteramethylammonium ion, tetrabutylammonium ion, and other<br>
organic cations.<br>
[0094] The trisulfides may be synthesized following procedures as illustrated in Scheme 1.<br>
For example, the aromatic or heterocyclic methylene halides (X = I or Br or CI) are reacted with<br><br>
thiourea. The resulted isothiouronium halides are treated with sodium hydroxide to provide the<br>
corresponding thiol derivatives (Furniss, B. S.; Hannaford, A. J.; Rogers, V.; Smith, P. W. G.;<br>
Tatchell, A. R. Vogel 's Textbook of Practical Organic Chemistry, Longman Group Limited,<br>
London, 1978, pp 582-583).<br><br>
Scheme 1. Synthetic methods for the symmetric and unsymmetric trisulfides<br>
[0095] The symmetric bisulfide derivatives may be synthesized using Method A. In<br>
Method A, /V-trime&amp;ylsilylimidazole is reacted with sulfur dichloride. The resulting di-<br>
imidazolylsulfide is then reacted with thiol to give the corresponding trisulfides. Method B can<br>
be used to synthesize symmetric and asymmetric trisulfides. In Method B, the first thiol is<br>
reacted with sulfur dichloride quantitatively at low temperature. The resulting intermediate<br>
thiosulfenyl chloride is then reacted with the second thiol to provide the desired asymmetric or<br>
symmetric trisulfide, depending on the thiol used in the second step.<br>
[0096] The representative aromatic methylene thiols 1-6 (Scheme 2) may be synthesized<br>
using the similar procedure as described in Vogel's Practical Organic Chemistry, pp 582-583. In<br>
addition, symmetric trisulfide derivatives 7-32 (Scheme 2) were synthesized by Method A<br>
similar to the reported procedure (Banerji, A.; Kalena, G. P. Tetrahedron Letters 1980,21,<br>
3003-3004). For example, sulfur dichloride (14 mmol) in anhydrous hexanes or<br>
dichloromethane was added to a stirred solution of TV-trimethylsilylimidazole (28 mmol) in<br>
hexanes at room temperature. After stirring for 30 minutes, the reaction mixture was cooled to 0<br><br>
°C, and a solution of designated thiol (28 mmol) in anhydrous hexanes was added dropwise for a<br>
period of 30 minutes. The reaction mixture was stirred for 30 minutes, and the precipitated<br>
imidazole by-product was filtered off. The filtrate was washed with water and brine, and dried<br>
over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solvent was evaporated, and the residue is purified by flash<br>
chromatography on a silica gel column using hexanes-ethyl acetate 100 : 1 to 20 : 1 as eluents to<br>
provide desired trisulfides 7-32 in 60-90% yields. The aromatic trisulfides 33-39 were<br>
synthesized by the similar procedure in 30-70% yields.<br>

benzenedimethanethiol or 2-butene-l,4-dithiol (10 mrnol) and anhydrous pyridine (20 mmol) in<br>

filtered and concentrated. The residue is passed through a short pad of silica gel using hexanes-<br>
ethyl acetate as eluent to provide di-substituted bisulfides in 40-90% yields.<br><br><br><br>
[0113] The trisulfide derivatives may be synthesized by the methods described above or by<br>
the approach illustrated in Scheme 6. The tetra- and penta-sulfide derivatives are synthesized by<br>
the similar strategy based on the reported procedure (Sinha, P.; Jundu, A.; Roy, S.; Prabhakar,<br>
S.; Vairamani, M.; Sankar, A. R.; Kunwar, A. C. Organometallics 2001, 20, 157-162).<br><br><br>
[0114] The symmetric or asymmetric sulfenic sulfonic thioanhydride derivatives (Scheme 7)<br>
can be synthesized based on the reported procedures (Karpp, D. N.; Gleason, J. G.; Ash, D. K. J.<br>
Org. Chem. 1971,36,322-326; and Harpp, D. N.; Ash, D. K.; Smith, R. A. J. Org. Chem. 1979,<br>
44,4135-4140).<br>
[0115] The present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising an<br>
effective amount of a compound having formula 1-5 optionally with an antiproliferative agent,<br>
and a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient. As used herein, an "effective amount" refers to the<br>
amount of the compound which is required to confer a therapeutic effect on the treated subject.<br>
The effective amount or dose will vary as recognized by those skilled in the art, depending on<br>
the types of tumors treated, route of administration, and possible co-administration with other<br>
therapeutic treatments such as use of other anti-tumor agents or radiation therapy.<br>
[0116] As used herein, the term "antiproliferative agent" refers to a therapeutic agent that<br>
may be used for treating or ameliorating a cell proliferative disorder such as tumors or cancer.<br>
Examples of antiproliferative agents include but are not limited to an antineoplastic agent, an<br>
alkylating agent, a plant alkaloid, an antimicrobial agent, a sulfonamide, an antiviral agent, a<br>
platinum agent, and other anticancer agents known in the art. Particular examples of<br>
antiproliferative agents include but are not limited to cisplatin, carboplatin, busulphan,<br>
methotrexate, daunorubicin, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, mephalan, vincristine, vinblastine,<br>
chlorambucil, paclitaxel, gemcitabine, and others known in the art. (See e.g., Goodman &amp;<br>
Gilman's, The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics (9th Ed) (Goodman, et ah, eds.)<br>
(McGraw-Hill) (1996); and 1999 Physician's Desk Reference (1998)).<br>
[0117] Any suitable formulation of the compounds described herein may be prepared. In<br>
cases where compounds are sufficiently basic or acidic to form stable nontoxic acid or base salts,<br>
administration of the compounds as salts may be appropriate. Examples of pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts are organic acid addition salts formed with acids that form a physiological<br>
acceptable anion, for example, tosylate, methanesulfonate, acetate, citrate, malonate, tartarate,<br>
succinate, benzoate, ascorbate, a-ketoglutarate, and a-glycerophosphate. Suitable inorganic salts<br>
may also be formed, including hydrochloride, sulfate, nitrate, bicarbonate, and carbonate salts.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are obtained using standard procedures well known in the art,<br>
for example, by a sufficiently basic compound such as an amine with a suitable acid, affording a<br>
physiologically acceptable anion. Alkali metal (e.g., sodium, potassium or lithium) or alkaline<br>
earth metal (e.g., calcium) salts of carboxylic acids also are made.<br><br>
[0118] The compounds having formula 1-5 as described herein are generally soluble in<br>
organic solvents such as chloroform, dichloromefhane, ethyl acetate, ethanol, methanol,<br>
isopropanol, acetonitrile, glycerol, N, N-dimethylformamide, TV.A'-dimetheylaceatmide,<br>
dimethylsulfoxide, etc. In one embodiment, the present invention provides formulations<br>
prepared by admixing a compound having formula 1-5 with a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
carrier. In one aspect, the formulation may be prepared using a method comprising: a)<br>
dissolving a compound of claim 1 in a water-soluble organic solvent, a non-ionic solvent, a<br>
water-soluble lipid, a cyclodextrin, a vitamin such as tocopherol, a fatty acid, a fatty acid ester, a<br>
phospholipid, or a combination thereof, to provide a solution; and b) adding saline our a buffer<br>
containing 1-10% carbohydrate solution. In one example, the carbohydrate comprises dextrose.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions obtained using the present methods are stable and useful for<br>
animal and clinical applications.<br>

[0125] One of ordinary skill in the art may modify the formulations within the teachings of<br>
the specification to provide numerous formulations for a particular route of administration. In<br>
particular, the compounds may be modified to render them more soluble in water or other<br>
vehicle. It is also well within the ordinary skill of the art to modify the route of administration<br>
and dosage regimen of a particular compound in order to manage the pharmacokinetics of the<br>
present compounds for maximum beneficial effect in a patient.<br>
C. Methods of Using Substituted Organo Sulfur Derivatives and<br>
Pharmaceutical Compositions Thereof<br>
[0126] The compounds as described herein may be used as cytotoxic and/or cytostatic agents<br>
in treating cancers or other types of proliferative disease. These compounds may function<br>
through any type of action mechanisms. For example, the compounds may inhibit G2/M<br>
progression of the cell cycle, which might eventually induce apoptosis in tumor cells (see, e.g.,<br>
Weung, et al. Biochim. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1997,263,398-404). Some compounds may<br>
disrupt tubulin assembly, and other compounds may disrupt tubulin disassembly, which may<br>
inhibit cell mitosis and induce cell apoptosis (see, e.g., Panda, et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA,<br>
1997,94,10560-10564). The compounds may also inhibit endothelial cell proliferation and<br>
angiogenesis effect (see, e.g., Witte, et al. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1998,17,155-161).<br>
[0127] The present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions for the treatment of<br>
a cell proliferative disorder, comprising any compound having formula 1-5, including but not<br>
limited to dibenzyltrisulfide, di(p-chlorobenzyl)trisulfide, (p-chloroben2yl)ben2yltrisulfide,<br><br>
di(p-nitrobenzyl)trisulfide, di(3-phenyl-2-propenyl)-trisuIfide, diphenyltrisulfide,<br>
or di(p-t-butylphenyl)trisulfide.<br>
[0128] To practice the method of the present invention, compounds having formula 1-5 and<br>
pharmaceutical compositions thereof may be administered orally, parenterally, by inhalation<br>
spray, topically, rectally, nasally, buccally, vaginally, via an implanted reservoir, or other drug<br>
administration methods. The term "parenteral" as used herein includes subcutaneous,<br>
intracutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, intraarticular, intraarterial, intrasynovial, intrasternal,<br>
intrathecal, intralesional and intracranial injection or infusion techniques.<br>
[0129] A sterile injectable composition, such as a sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous<br>
suspension, may be formulated according to techniques known in the art using suitable<br>
dispersing of wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also<br>
be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or<br>
solvent. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed include mannitol,<br>
water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are<br>
conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium (e.g., synthetic mono- or<br>
diglycerides). Fatty acids, such as oleic acid and its glyceride derivatives, are useful in the<br>
preparation of injectables, as are pharmaceutically acceptable oils, such as olive oil or castor oil,<br>
especially in their polyoxyethylated versions. These oil solutions or suspensions can also<br>
contain a long-chain alcohol diluent or dispersant, or carboxymethyl cellulose or similar<br>
dispersing agents. Various emulsifying agents or bioavailability enhancers which are commonly<br>
used in the manufacture of pharmaceutically acceptable solid, liquid, or other dosage forms can<br>
also be used for the purpose of formulation.<br>
[0130] A composition for oral administration may be any orally acceptable dosage form<br>
including, but not limited to, tablets, capsules, emulsions and aqueous suspensions, dispersions<br>
and solutions. In the case of tablets for oral use, commonly used carriers include lactose and<br>
corn starch. Lubricating agents, such as magnesium stearate, can also be added. For oral<br>
administration in a capsule form, useful diluents include lactose and dried com starch. When<br>
aqueous suspensions or emulsions are administered orally, the active ingredient can be<br>
suspended or dissolved in an oily phase combined with emulsifying or suspending agents. If<br>
needed, certain sweetening, flavoring, or coloring agents can be added. A nasal aerosol or<br>
inhalation compositions can be prepared according to techniques well-known in the art of<br>
pharmaceutical formulation and can be prepared as solutions in, for example saline, employing<br><br>
suitable preservatives (for example, benzyl alcohol), absorption promoters to enhance<br>
bioavailability, and/or other solubilizing or dispersing agents known in the art.<br>
[0131] In addition, the compounds having formula 1-5 may be administered alone or in<br>
combination with other anticancer agents for the treatment of various cancers or conditions.<br>
Combination therapies according to the present invention comprise the administration of at least<br>
one compound of the present invention or a functional derivative thereof and at least one other<br>
pharmaceutically active ingredient. The active ingredient(s) and pharmaceutically active agents<br>
may be administered separately or together. The amounts of the active ingredient(s) and<br>
pharmaceutically active agent(s) and the relative timings of administration will be selected in<br>
order to achieve the desired combined therapeutic effect.<br>
[0132] In one embodiment, the present invention is directed to a method of treating or<br>
ameliorating a cancer of a tissue or organ, including but not limited to leukemia, lymphoma,<br>
lung cancer, colon cancer, CNS cancer, melanoma, ovarian cancer, renal cancer, prostate cancer,<br>
breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, renal cancer, and other types of proliferative disease<br>
comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound having formula 1-5.<br>
[0133] In another embodiment, the present invention is directed to a method of treatment of<br>
restenosis after coronary stenting for patients with coronary artery diseases with a compound<br>
having formula 1-5, such as dibenzyl trisulfide and other substituted trisulfide derivatives. One<br>
of the main causes of restenosis after coronary stenting for patients with coronary artery disease<br>
is neointimal hyperplasia which may result from the proliferation and migration of smooth-<br>
muscle cells and extracellular matrix productions (see, for example, "Pathology of acute and<br>
chronic coronary stenting in humans", by Farb, A., Sangiorgi, G., Certer, A. J., et al.<br>
Circulation, 1999,99,44-52). Compounds that have anti-proliferation capability may have an<br>
effect in reducing the risk of clinical and angiographic restenosis when such compounds are<br>
delivered with a suitable means (see, for example, "A polymer-based, paclitaxel-eluting stent in<br>
patients with coronary artery disease", by Stone, G. W., Ellis, S. G., Cox, D. A, et al. New Engl.<br>
J. Med., 2004,350,221-231). Thus, dibenzyl trisulfide and other compounds having formula 1-<br>
5 may also be useful in inhibiting proliferation of the cells involved in neointimal hyperplasia<br>
and thus reducing the incidence of neointimal hyperplasia and restenosis.<br>
[0134] Various methods may be used to effectively deliver compounds having formula 1-5<br>
to their target, such as cells. For example, a composition comprising dibenzyl trisulfide, or a<br>
another compound having formula 1-5 maybe administered orally, parenterally, or via an<br>
implanted reservoir. In other examples, the approaches described in the following papers hereby<br><br>
incorporated by reference, may also be used: "A polymer-based, paclitaxel-eluting stent in<br>
patients with coronary artery disease", by Stone, G. W., Ellis, S. G., Cox, D.A. et al. New Engl.<br>
J. Med. 2004, 350,221-231; "A randomized comparison of a sirolirnus-emting stent with a<br>
standard stent for coronary revascularization", by Morice, M.-C, Serruys, P. W., Sousa, J. E., et<br>
al. New Engl. J. Med. 2002, 346, 1773-1780; "Sirolimus-eluting stents versus standard stents in<br>
patients with stenosis in a native coronary artery", by Moses, J. W., Leon, M. B., Popma, J. J., et<br>
al, New Engl. J. Med. 2003, 349,1315-1323.<br>
[0135] The anticancer efficacy of dibenzyl trisulfide and substituted organo sulfur analogues<br>
described above may be preliminarily screened in vitro using a penal of cancer cell lines by<br>
standard endpoint assay formats (see below for the detailed description), or by real time<br>
electronic cell sensing (RT-CES) system, which provides dynamic cell response information<br>
after exposing to an anticancer agent. Several endpoint cell-based screening assay formats for<br>
anticancer agent discovery and validation may be used. For example, National Cancer Institute<br>
(NCI) provides an endpoint cytotoxicity assay system using a panel of 60 cancer cell lines,<br>
which can be used for a large scale of cell-based screening of anticancer agents. (See, e.g.,<br>
Monks, A., etal. J Natl. Cancer Inst. 1991, 83, 757-766; Alley, M. C, et al. Cancer Res. 1988,<br>
48, 589-601; Shoemaker, R. H., etal. Proc. Clin. Biol. Res. 1988,276, 265-286; and Stinson, et<br>
al. Proc. Am. Asso. Cancer Res. 1989,30, 613).<br>
[0136] In this screening method, cell suspension that is diluted to a desired cell<br>
concentration is added into wells of a 96-well microtiter plate so that each well is having<br>
solution about 100 microliters with cell number between thousands (for example, 5000) and tens<br>
of thousands (for example, 40,000). The number of cells added to individual wells depends on<br>
cell type, cell size, cell growth characteristics. Cells in the plate are incubated at 37 °C,<br>
saturated humidity and 5% CO2 atmosphere in a standard cell culture incubator for about 24 hrs.<br>
Compounds of interest are prepared into test solutions with serial diluted concentrations. In one<br>
example, the dilution factor in the serial diluted solutions is 10-fold (or 2-, 3-, 4-fold) and five<br>
(or six to ten) different concentrations with a ratio of highest concentration to lowest<br>
concentration of 10,000. Other dilution factors and other various concentrations may also be<br>
used. Typically, the highest concentration of the test compound is 10^ M. About 100<br>
microliters of test solutions are added into each well at 24 hours after initial cell seeding into<br>
wells. Test solutions of each compound concentration are added into at least two wells for<br>
replicating purpose. The test compound may be dissolved in an organic solvent such as DMSO,<br><br>
and the 100 microliter test solutions may be a mixture of aqueous solution with the organic<br>
solvent-based solution or suspension.<br>
[0137] After compound addition, cells are then incubated with the compound for additional<br>
48 hours at 37 °C in 5% C02 atmosphere and saturated humidity. The cells can then be assayed<br>
for their viable cell numbers by various assays, for example, the sulforhodamine B assay (as<br>
described by Rubinstein, L.V., etal. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1990, 82,1113-1118; and Skehan, P.,<br>
et al J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1990, 82,1107-1112). A plate reader is then used to read the optical<br>
densities and an IC50 value, the concentration of drug that causes 50% growth inhibition, (or<br>
GI50 value to emphasize the correction for the cells counted at time zero), is derived based on the<br>
dose response curves. Thus, GI50 values are used to measure the growth inhibitory power of the<br>
test compound. See Boyd, et al in Cytotoxic Anticancer Drugs: Models and Concepts for Drug<br>
Discoveiy and Development; Vleriote, F. A., Corbett T. H., Baker L. H. (Eds.); Kluwer<br>
Academic: Hingham, Mass., 1992, pp 11-34.<br>
[01381 In another assay format, a test compound is assayed for its cytotoxicity and/or<br>
cytostatic effect on certain cancer cell types, using endpoint assay methods. Cells in the NCI<br>
cancer cell panel may be used. Cells after a pre-incubation for certain length of time (for<br>
example, 8 hrs or 24 hrs) are incubated with a test compound at serially-diluted concentrations<br>
(for example, five 10-fold dilutions) for 24 hrs and/or 48 hrs, and/or other specific length of<br>
time. The dose dependent cytotoxicity and/or cytostatic effects of test compounds can then be<br>
tested and evaluated using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide<br>
(MTT) assay method, as described by, for example, Boyd (In Principle of Practice of Oncology,<br>
Devita, J. T., Hellman, S. and Rosenberg S. A. (Eds), 1989, Vol, 3, PPO Update, No. 10).<br>
[0139] Another in vitro assay may be used to evaluate the effect of compounds in arresting<br>
the cell cycle progression. More specifically, a test compound is added to cells of certain cell<br>
lines in a concentration-dependent manner. After cells are incubated for certain specific length<br>
of time, cells are stained using propidium iodide and are used for flow cytometric assessment.<br>
The cell populations of sub-GO/Gl, G0/G1, S and G2/M phases are determined. All above in<br>
vitro assays are cell-based, single-time point (or multiple-time points using multiple plates) end-<br>
point assays.<br>
[0140] Test compounds may also be screened using a novel in vitro cell-based screening<br>
assay system based on the electronic measurement of cell-substrate or cell-electrode<br>
impedances. In contrast to all the endpoint assay systems, the cell-based screening assay<br>
system allows for real time monitoring dynamic response of cancer cells to anticancer agents<br><br>
without labeling cells. This system can also be used for a large scale of in vitro cell-based high<br>
throughput screening of anticancer agents. The approach features in the integration of molecular<br>
and cell biology with microelectronics and is based on the electronic detection of biological<br>
assay process.<br>
[0141] The details of this cell electronic sensing technology, called real-time cell electronic<br>
sensing (RT-CES™) and associated devices, systems and methods of use are described in<br>

[0142] For measurement of cell-substrate or cell-electrode impedance using RT-CES<br>
technology, microelectrodes having appropriate geometries are fabricated onto the bottom<br>
surfaces of microliter plate or similar device, facing into the wells. Cells are introduced into the<br>
wells of the devices, and make contact to and attach to the electrode surfaces. The presence,<br>
absence or change of properties of cells affects the electronic and ionic passage on the electrode<br>
sensor surfaces. Measuring the impedance between or among electrodes provides important<br><br>
information about biological status of cells present on the sensors. When there are changes to<br>
the biological status of the cells analogue, electronic readout signals are measured automatically<br>
and in real time, and are converted to digital signals for processing and analysis. In a RT-CES<br>
system, a cell index is automatically derived and provided based on measured electrode<br>
impedance values. The cell index obtained for a given well reflects : 1) how many cells are<br>
attached to the electrode surfaces in this well; 2) how well cells are attached to the electrode<br>
surfaces in this well. Thus, the more the cells of same type in similar physiological conditions<br>
attach the electrode surfaces, the larger the cell index. And, the better the cells attach to the<br>
electrode surfaces (e.g., the cells spread-out more to have larger contact areas, or the cells attach<br>
tighter to electrode surfaces), the larger the cell index.<br>
[0143] Through the use of the RT-CES system, dibenzyl trisulfide has been shown to inhibit<br>
proliferation of a variety of cancer types. Dibenzyl trisulfide has not previously been found<br>
using standard endpoint assays. Negative conclusions that dibenzyl trisulfide has no<br>
antiproliferation activity were made by the previous researchers ^Discovery of novel inducers<br>
of cellular differentiation using HL-60 promyelocyte cells", Mata-Greenwood, E., Ito, A.,<br>
Westernburg, H., Cui, B., Mehta, R. G., Kinghorn, A. D. and Pezzuto, J. M. Anticancer Res.<br>
2001,21,1763-1770).<br>
[0144] To evaluate the anticancer efficacy and to predict possible mechanisms of the<br>
anticancer action of the dibenzyl trisulfide, ten anticancer compounds were tested with known<br>
mechanisms of action side by side with dibenzyl trisulfide utilizing a panel of 12 cancer cell<br>
lines. The time-dependent, cell responsive patterns of dibenzyl trisulfide (at certain<br>
concentrations) were somewhat similar to those of paclitaxel, vinblastine and colceimid (at<br>
certain concentrations). Thus, dibenzyl trisulfide may have mechanisms of anticancer action<br>
similar to those of paclitaxel, vinblastine, and colceimid. Dibenzyl trisulfide may act on cancer<br>
cells through other mechanisms of action, different from those of paclitaxel, vinblastine and<br>
colceimid. It is also possible that dibenzyl trisulfide act on cancer cells through multiple<br>
mechanisms of action, including the mechanism of action similar to those of pacliotaxel,<br>
vinblastine and colceimid.<br>
[0145] In addition to the in vitro cell models and assay formats, anti-tumor activity of<br>
compounds can be further assessed and evaluated by in vivo animal models with transplanted<br>
cancer. Most in vivo models are mouse models.<br><br>
In vitro cell-based screening using real-time cell electronic sensing (RT-CES) system<br>
[0146] The RT-CES system comprises three components, an electronic sensor analyzer, a<br>
device station and 16X or 96X microtiter plate devices. Microelectrode sensor array was<br>
fabricated on glass slides with lithographical microfabrication methods and the electrode-<br>
containing slides are assembled to plastic trays to form electrode-containing wells. Each 16X<br>
(or 96X) microtiter plate device used in RT-CES system comprises up to 16 (or 96) such<br>
electrode-containing wells. The device station receives the 16X or 96X microtiter plate devices<br>
and is capable of electronically switching any one of the wells to the sensor analyzer for<br>
impedance measurement. In operation, the devices with cells cultured in the wells are placed<br>
into a device station that is located inside an incubator. Electrical cables connect the device<br>
station to the sensor analyzer. Under the RT-CES software control, the sensor analyzer can<br>
automatically select wells to be measured and continuously conduct impedance measurements.<br>
The impedance data from the analyzer is transferred to a computer, analyzed and processed by<br>
the integrated software.<br>
[0147] Impedance measured between electrodes in an individual well depends on electrode<br>
geometry, ionic concentration in the well and whether there are cells attached to the electrodes.<br>
In the absence of the cells, electrode impedance is mainly determined by the ion environment<br>
both at the electrode/solution interface and in the bulk solution. In the presence of the cells,<br>
cells attached to the electrode sensor surfaces will alter the local ionic environment at the<br>
electrode/solution interface, leading to an increase in the impedance. The more cells there are<br>
on the electrodes, the larger the increase in cell-electrode impedance. Furthermore, the<br>
impedance change also depends on cell morphology and the extent to which cells attach to the<br>
electrodes.<br>
[0148] To quantify cell status based on the measured cell-electrode impedance, a parameter<br>
termed Cell Index is derived, according to<br><br>
where Rb(f) and R^Af) are the frequency dependent electrode resistances (a component of<br>
impedance) without cells or with cell present, respectively. N is the number of the frequency<br>
points at which the impedance is measured. Thus, Cell Index is a quantitative measure of the<br>
status of the cells in an electrode-containing well. Under the same physiological conditions,<br>
more cells attached on to the electrodes leads to larger Rcel! (/) value, leading to a larger value<br><br>
for Cell Index. Furthermore, for the same number of cells present in the well, a change in the<br>
cell status such as morphology will lead to a change in the Cell Index. For example, an increase<br>
in cell adhesion or cell spreading leads to larger cell-electrode contact area which will lead to an<br>
increase in Rcell{f) and thus a larger value for Cell Index. The Cell Index may also be<br>
calculated using a formula different from the one described here. Other methods for calculating<br>
the Cell Index based on impedance measurement can be found in PCT application number<br>

[0149] Different types of human cancer cells, including NCI-H460 (non-small cell lung<br>
cancer cells), MV522 SW (non-small cell lung cancer cells), MCF7 (breast cancer cells), A549<br>
(non-small cell lung cancer cells), PC3 (prostate cancer cells), A431 (epidermoid cancer cells),<br>
HT1080 (fibrosarcoma cells), MDA.MB2321 (breast cancer cells), HT29 (colon cancer cells),<br>
HCC2998 (colon cancer cells), OVCAR4 (ovarian cancer cells), A2780 (ovarian cancer cells)<br>
and HepG2 (human hepatosarcoma) with different numbers (4000 to 20,000 per well) were<br>
seeded into 16X or 96X microliter device and monitored by RT-CES™ system. The cells were<br>
allowed to grow for about 24 hours prior to the addition of dibenzyl trisulfide dissolved in<br>
DMSO solution (final DMSO concentration: 0.2%; final dibenzyl trisulfide concentration:<br>
between 1.5625 uM and 100 uM). The cell-electrode impedance was continuously measured<br>
and the corresponding, time dependent cell-index values were derived and recorded.<br>
[0150] Figures 1-5,6A, and 7-12 show the time-dependent cell index for a number of cell<br>
lines prior to and after addition of dibenzyl trisulfide at various concentrations. As shown in the<br>
Figures, dibenzyl trisulfide exhibited inhibitory effect on the proliferation of a number of cancer<br>
cell lines. The susceptibility to dibenzyl trisulfide differs among the cancer cell types. For some<br>
cancer cell types, a low dosage of dibenzyl trisulfide is sufficient to significantly inhibit cancer<br>
cell proliferation, whilst for other cancer cell types, a higher dosage is needed to achieve similar<br>
inhibition degree.<br>
[0151] In one example, Figures IB and 1C show the time-dependent cell index for H460<br>
(non-small cell lung cancer cell line) cells prior to and after addition of colcemid and paclitaxel<br>
at various concentrations. As shown in Figures IB and 1C, colcemid and paclitaxel exhibited<br>
inhibitory ability against the proliferation of A431 cells at concentrations studied. Furthermore,<br>
these figures indicate that after compound addition (colcemid or paclitaxel), the cell indices for<br>
H460 cells first decreased with time and then increased, showing that H460 cells had complex<br><br>
kinetic responses to either colcemid and paclitaxel. It is noteworthy that cell index curves<br>
shown in Figure 1A for H460 cells under the influence of dibenzyl trisulfide (DBTS) at<br>
concentration of 25 uM and above are somewhat similar to the curves in Figures IB and 1C, i.e.,<br>
after addition of DBTS (25 uM and above), the cell indices for H460 cells also first decreased<br>
with time and then increased.<br>
[0152] In another example, Figure 6B shows the time-dependent cell index for A431<br>
(epidermoid cancer cell line) cells prior to and after addition of 5-flourouracil at various<br>
concentrations. As shown in Figure 6B, 5-flourouracil exhibited inhibitory ability against the<br>
proliferation of A431 cells at concentrations of 12.5 uM and above. The time dependent cell<br>
index curves in Figure 6B are significantly different from those in Figure 6A.<br>
[0153] In another example, Figure 13 shows the cell index data of HepaG-2 cell lines under<br>
the influence of dibenzyl trisulfide. As shown in Figure 13, dibenzyl trisulfide did not<br>
demonstrate anti-proliferation ability on HepaG-2 cells.<br>
In vivo Screening for Anticancer Activity<br>
[0154] To evaluate the in vivo anticancer efficacy of the test compounds including DBTS<br>
and ACEA100108 (a derivative of DBTS, see Table 33), various mouse models were used,<br>
including the mouse sarcoma S180 model, the mouse Lewis lung cancer model, P3 88<br>
lymphocytic leukemia model, and three human tumor xenograft models in immunodeficient<br>
nude mice: Bcap-37 human breast cancer, HCT-8 human colon cancer, aol2/17 human ovarian<br>
cancer. Details of the in vivo anticancer efficacy of the test compounds are provided below.<br>
Assessment of Acute Toxicity of DBTS and Compound ACEA100108<br>
[0155] To evaluate the in vivo acute, intravenous toxicity of DBTS and ACEA100108<br>
(a derivative of DBTS, see Table 33), the experiments were performed in non-tumor bearing,<br>
normal Kunming mice by monitoring the acute response of mice to a single dose of DBTS or<br>
ACEA100108 via intravenous injection (i.v.). The number of death for the treated mice was<br>
monitored and recorded. LD50 values for these compounds were calculated. Details of the study<br>
are provided below.<br>
[0156] The following examples are offered to illustrate but not to limit the invention.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Anticancer Activity of DBTS Against Mouse Sarcoma SI80 and<br>
Mouse Lewis Lung Cancer<br>
[0157] To evaluate the in vivo anticancer efficacy of the test compounds, two mouse<br>
transplanted tumor models were used for the in vivo evaluation: the mouse sarcoma S180 model<br>
and the mouse Lewis lung cancer model. Experimental mice were maintained in the<br>
Pharmacology Lab of Shanghai Pharmaceutical Industry Institute. The mouse source and<br>
specifications are as follows. The mice were C57BL/6 and Kunming strains, provided by<br>
Academic Sinica, Experimental Animal Center, and certification number: Academic Sinica<br>
Experimental Animal Certificate, No. 5. The mouse weight is between 18-20 g. Both male and<br>
female mice were used. However, for each experiment, animals of same sex were used. The<br>
number of animals tested were as follows: 30 mice for the test compound group, including 10<br>
for the high dose group, 10 for the middle dose group and 10 for the low dose group; 10 mice<br>
were for the positive compound group; 20 mice for the negative control group, including 10<br>
mice for the Normal Saline group and 10 mice for the solvent only group. The high, middle and<br>
low doses of DBTS are, 50,25 and 12.5 mg/kg/d, respectively.<br>
[0158] Test controls. For the negative control, two groups were set up: the solvent only<br>
control group and normal saline control group. In the solvent only control group, each mouse<br>
was administered intravenously with the solvent only having the same volume and same<br>
concentration (10% for the sarcoma SI80 model and 5% for the Lewis lung cancer model) as<br>
those used for high dose DBTS test, once a day, and for 7 or 10 consecutive days. In the normal<br>
saline group, each mouse was administered with 0.5ml of normal saline, once per day and for 7<br>
or 10 consecutive days. For the positive control group, the anticancer compound,<br>
cyclophosphamide (CTX) was administered intraperitoneally at 30 mg/kg, once per day and for<br>
7 or 10 consecutive days.<br>
[0159] Preparation and Administration of Test Compounds. Test compound solutions for<br>
evaluating anti-tumor efficiency cancer models were prepared as follows. In the mouse sarcoma<br>
S180 mouse model, 200 mg of DBTS was dissolved in 10 mL of castor oil (in polyoxyethlated<br>
version) first, and then mixed with 90 mL of normal saline. The final DBTS concentration in the<br>
solution is 0.2%, and the final solvent concentration is 10%. Each mouse was administered<br>
intravenously with the compound solution of 0.5 mL (high dose), 0.3 mL (middle dose) and 0.15<br>
mL (low dose), respectively.<br><br>
[0160] In the mouse Lewis lung cancer model, 200 mg of DBTS was dissolved in 5 mL<br>
castor oil (in polyoxyethlated version). Each time before use, this solution was diluted with<br>
normal saline to achieve final DBTS concentration of 0.2% (high dose), 0.1% (middle dose) and<br>
0.05% (low dose) respectively. In this case, each mouse (about 20 g in weight) was<br>
administered intravenously with 0.5 mL of the compound solution of a given compound<br>
concentration. The intravenous injection speed was about 0.5 mL / 0.5 min.<br>
[0161] The dosages and administration of test compounds are within the knowledge of those<br>
commonly skilled in pharmacology. For example, the test compounds may be administered by<br>
intravenous injection with a test compound solution twice per day and for 7 consecutive days.<br>
Alternatively, the test compounds may be administered by intravenous injection with a test<br>
compound solution once per day and for 10 consecutive days.<br>
[0162] Preparation of Tumor Cells for Transplantation and Determination of Compound<br>
Efficacy. To prepare the tumor cells, the fast grown tumors were first removed from the<br>
transplanted tumor mice (the sarcoma SI80 model or the Lewis lung cancer model), the tumor<br>
tissues were dissected, and the tumor cell suspensions were prepared from the dissected tissues<br>
at the concentration of 2-4 x 107 tumor cells/ml. 0.2 mL of the tumor cell suspension (between 4<br>
and 8 million tumor cells) was then transplanted back into an experimental mouse by<br>
subcutaneous injection. Twenty four hours after the transplantation, mice were administered<br>
intravenously with a given dose of DBTS, with normal saline, or solvent only which served as<br>
the negative control, or with 50 mg/kg CTX intraperitoneally which served as the positive<br>
control. Two weeks after the transplantation, mice were sacrificed and the transplanted tumors<br>
were removed from the experimental mice. Each removed solid tumor was weighted, and the<br>
tumor inhibition rate in the DBTS-treated groups and in the CTX-treated group was calculated<br>
according to the formula:<br>
Tumor inhibition rate % = (average weight of tumor in the negative control group —<br>
average weight of tumor in the compound treated group)/average weight of tumor in the<br>
negative control group X 100	(2)<br>
[0163] For the mouse sarcoma S180 model, the S180 cells were subcutaneously transplanted<br>
at approximately 5 million cells per mouse. After 24 hours of the transplantation, each mouse in<br>
the test group was administered intravenously with dibenzyl trisulfide at 50,25, or 12.5 mg/kg<br>
respectively per day and for 7 or 10 consecutive days. For the positive control group, each<br>
mouse was administered with cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan, CTX) at 50 mg/kg intraperitoneally<br>
per day and for 7 consecutive days. For the negative control group, each mouse was<br><br>
administered intravenously either with normal saline, or with the solvent for dihenzyl trisulfide<br>
at the same concentration as that in the test group per day and for consecutive 7 days. For each<br>
group, 10 mice were used.<br>
[0164] For the mouse Lewis lung cancer model, the Lewis lung cancer cells were<br>
subcutaneously transplanted at approximately 5 million cells per mouse. After 24 hours of the<br>
transplantation, each mouse in the test group was administered intravenously with dibenzyl<br>
trisulfide at 50,25, or 12.5 mg/kg per day and for 10 consecutive days. For the positive control<br>
group, each mouse was administered with CTX at 50 mg/kg intraperitoneally per day and for 10<br>
consecutive days. For the negative control group, each mouse was administered intravenously<br>
either with normal saline, or with the solvent for dibenzyl trisulfide at the same concentration as<br>
that in the test group per day and for consecutive 10 days. For each group, 10 mice were used.<br>
[0165] Results, hi the mouse sarcoma SI80 model, DBTS showed an average tumor<br>
inhibition rate of 63.30%, 54.68% and 48.69% for the 50,25 and 12.5 mg/kg dosage groups<br>
respectively (relative to the normal saline control). The detailed results are shown in Table 9 and<br>
Figure 14, describing an in vivo efficacy study of 0.2 % DBTS in the mouse sarcoma SI80<br>
model. In Figure 14, the seven rows (1-7, respectively) represent results from the following<br>
administered compounds (iv x 7qd): 1) negative control; 2) normal saline; 3) DBTS (25 ml/kg);<br>
4) DBTS (15 ml/kg); 5) DBTS (7.5 ml/kg); 6) solvent control (15 ml/kg) and 7) positive control<br>
CTX (30 mg/kg).<br>
[0166] It was observed that right after the intravenous injection of DBTS, mice exhibited<br>
transient abnormal reactions including jumping, fast breathing, and lying down followed by<br>
reduced activities. Such reactions typically lasted 10-15 minutes. The same abnormal reactions<br>
were also seen in the mice intravenously injected with only solvent. Therefore, the injection<br>
speed and the high concentration of the solvent other than DBTS may result in the transient<br>
abnormal reactions in the mice.<br>
[0167] In the Lewis lung cancer model, DBTS showed an average tumor inhibition rate of<br>
67.05%, 51.34% and 45.21% for the 50, 25 and 12.5 mg/kg dosage groups respectively (relative<br>
to the normal saline control). The detailed results are summarized in Table 10 and Figure 15,<br>
describing an efficacy study of 0.2 % DBTS on mouse Lewis lung cancer. In Figure 15, the<br>
seven rows (1-7, respectively) represent results from the following administered compounds: 1)<br>
negative control; 2) normal saline; 3) DBTS (25 ml/kg); 4) DBTS (15 ml/kg); 5) DBTS (7.5<br>
ml/kg); 6) solvent control (15 ml/kg) and 7) positive control CTX (30 mg/kg).. DBTS and the<br>
solvent control were administered iv x 10 qd; the positive control was administered ip x 7qd. In<br><br>
contrast to the mice used for the mouse sarcoma S180 experiment, the mice intravenously<br>
injected with either DBTS or solvent in this experiment showed much minor transient abnormal<br>
reactions.<br>
[0168] By using the solvent only as the negative control, the average in vivo tumor inhibition<br>
rates of DTBS for the SI80 sarcoma are 50.25%, 38.58% and 30.46% in 50, 25 and 12.5 mg/kg<br>
dosage groups respectively, as shown in Table 11. For the Lewis lung cancer model, the<br>
average in vivo tumor inhibition rates of DBTS are 62.28%, 44.30% and 37.38% in the 50,25<br>
and 12.5 mg/kg dosage groups respectively, as shown in Table 12.<br>
[0169] The results generated from two mouse transplanted tumor models demonstrate the<br>
specific inhibition of transplanted tumor growth in the mice administered intravenously with<br>
DBTS. When intravenously administered with a high dose of DBTS (50 mg/kg/d, and for 7 or<br>
10 consecutive days), a tumor inhibition rate of 65% was achieved in either mouse transplanted<br>
tumor model, by using the normal saline as the negative control. The solvent used to prepare<br>
DBTS solution showed a weak inhibitory effect on the tumor growth in the mouse transplanted<br>
tumor models, and may also cause transient abnormal reactions in mice after intravenous<br>
injection.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Anticancer Activity of DBTS on Mouse Lewis Lung Cancer<br>
[0170] This study evaluates the in vivo anticancer efficacy of dibenzyl trisulfide (DBTS) in<br>
the mouse Lewis lung cancer model as in Example 1. The experimental mice were maintained<br>
in the Pharmacology Lab of Shanghai Pharmaceutical Industry Institute. The mice for<br>
experiments were C57BL/6 strain, provided by Academic Sinica, Experimental Animal Center,<br>
certification number: SCXK (Shanghai) 2003-0003. The mouse weight was between 18 and 20<br>
g. Only female mice were used. The numbers of animals tested were as follows: 10 for each<br>
dose group, 10 for positive control group and 20 for negative control group (10 for physiological<br>
control group and 10 for solvent-control group).<br>
[0171] Test control. For the negative control, two groups were set up: the solvent only<br>
control group and normal saline control group. In the solvent only control group, each mouse<br>
was administered intravenously with the solvent only having the same volume and same<br>
concentration (5% solvent in normal saline) as those used in a high dose DBTS test, once a day,<br>
for 7-10 consecutive days. In the normal saline group, each mouse was administered with<br>
0.5 ml of normal saline, once a day, for 10 consecutive days. For positive control group, an<br>
anticancer compound, cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan, CTX, for intraperitoneal use) was<br>
administered inrraperitoneally at 30 mg/kg, once a day for 7 consecutive days. In addition, as a<br><br>
reference group, an anticancer compound, Taxol, was administered intravenously at 15, 10 and<br>
7.5 mg/kg, once a day for 5 consecutive days.<br>
[0172] Preparation and Administration of Test Compounds. 400 mg of DBTS was dissolved<br>
in 10 mL of castor oil (solvent) to have a DBTS concentration 40 mg/ml in the solvent. Each<br>
time before use, this solution was diluted in normal saline to achieve desired DBTS<br>
concentrations. Normal saline was added to dilute DBTS solution to desired concentrations of<br>
0.2% (high dose), 0.1% (middle dose) and 0.05% (low dose) respectively. Each mouse was<br>
administered intravenously with the compound solution of 0.5 mL at a controlled injection speed<br>
of 0.5 ml/0.5 min. 24 hrs after the tumor transplantation, intravenous injections of compound<br>
solutions into carrier mice were performed once a day, for consecutive 7 or 10 days.<br>
[0173] Preparation of Tumor cells for Transplantation and Determination of Compound<br>
Efficacy. To prepare the tumor cells, the fast growing tumors were first removed from the<br>
transplanted tumor mice, the tumor tissues were dissected and tumor cell suspensions were<br>
prepared in normal saline to have a concentration of 2-4 x 10' cells/ml. 0.2 ml of cell<br>
suspension was subcutaneously injected into the axillary region of each mouse. Twenty four<br>
hours after the transplantation, mice were administered with a given doses of DBTS, with<br>
normal saline, or solvent only which serves as the negative control, or with 30 mg/kg CTX<br>
intraperitoneally which served as the positive control. About two weeks after transplantation,<br>
mice were sacrificed and the transplanted tumors were removed from experimental mice. Each<br>
removed solid tumor was weighed; the tumor inhibition rate in each dosage group was<br>
calculated according to equation (2) in Example 1 (Anticancer Activity of DBTS Against Mouse<br>
Sarcoma SI80 and Mouse Lewis Lung Cancer).<br>
[0174] For the mouse Lewis lung cancer model, the Lewis lung cancer cells were<br>
subcutaneously transplanted at approximately 6 million cells per mouse. After 24 hours of the<br>
transplantation, each mouse in the test group was administered intravenously with dibenzyl<br>
trisulfide at 50,25, or 12.5 mg/kg per day and for 10 consecutive days. For the positive control<br>
group, each mouse was administered with CTX at 30 mg/kg intraperitoneally per day and for 7<br>
consecutive days. For the negative control group, each mouse was administered intravenously<br>
either with normal saline, or with the solvent for dibenzyl trisulfide at the same concentration as<br>
that in the test group per day and for consecutive 10 or 7 days. For each group, 10 mice were<br>
used. For Taxol reference group, each mouse in the test group was administered intravenously<br>
with Taxol at 15,10 or 7.5 mg/kg per day and for 5 consecutive days.<br><br>
[0175] Results. In the Lewis lung cancer model, DBTS showed an average tumor inhibition<br>
rate of 65.77%, 51.61% and 43.10% for the 50, 25 and 12.5 mg/kg dosage groups respectively<br>
(relative to the normal saline control). The detailed results are shown in Table 13. By using the<br>
solvent only as the negative control, the corresponding tumor inhibition rates are 61.02%,<br>
46.94% and 35.10%, respectively (Table 14). It was observed that right after the intravenous<br>
injection of DBTS, mice exhibited transient abnormal reactions including jumping, fast<br>
breathing, and lying down followed by reduced activities. Such reactions typically lasted 10-15<br>
minutes. The same abnormal reactions were also seen in the mice intravenously injected with<br>
only solvent.<br>
[0176J In the reference test, Taxol showed an average tumor inhibition rate of 48.94%, 36.97<br>
and 30.28% for the 15, 10 and 7.5 mg/kg dosage groups respectively (relative to the normal<br>
saline control). The detailed results are shown in Table 15.<br>
[0177] The result generated in the mouse Lewis lung cancer model demonstrates the specific<br>
inhibition of transplanted tumor growth in the mice administered intravenously with DBTS.<br>
When intravenously administered with a high dose of DBTS (50 mg/kg/d, and for 10<br>
consecutive days), a tumor inhibition rate of 65% was achieved in the mouse transplanted tumor<br>
model, by using the normal saline as the negative control. Such data have been shown to be<br>
reproducible. The solvent used to prepare DBTS solution showed a weak inhibitory effect on<br>
the tumor growth in the mouse transplanted tumor models, and may also cause transient<br>
abnormal reactions in mice after intravenous injection.<br><br><br><br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
In vivo Anticancer Activity of ACEA100108 on Lewis Lung Cancer and P388<br>
Lymphocytic Leukemia in Mice, and on Bcap-37 Human Breast Cancer and HCT-8<br>
Human Colon Cancer in Nude Mice<br>
[0178] To evaluate the in vivo anticancer efficacy of compound ACEA100108 (a DBTS<br>
derivative, see Table 33), mouse models with transplanted cancer were used, including Lewis<br>
lung cancer model and P388 lymphocytic leukemia model, and two human tumor xenograft<br>
models in immunodeficient nude mice: Bcap-37 human breast cancer and HCT-8 human colon<br>
cancer. All the mouse models are maintained in the Pharmacology Lab of Shanghai<br><br>
Pharmaceutical Industry Institute. For human tumor xenograft models, cancer cells were passed<br>
twice in vivo before being transplanted into the nude mice for the study. Cultured human cancer<br>
cells in flask were first xenograft-transplanted in immunodeficient nude mice. After the cancer<br>
cells grew to a tumor of certain sizes in the nude mice, the tumor was removed form the nude<br>
mice and tumor tissues were dissected. The cell suspensions were prepared from the dissected<br>
tumor tissue and transplanted back to immunodeficient nude mice again (i.e. the second passage<br>
of cancer cells in human cancer xenograft-transplanted model). After the cancer cells grew to<br>
certain size, the tumor was removed from nude mice and the tumor tissues were dissected. The<br>
cell suspensions were prepared from dissected tissues and were used for the study of human<br>
cancer xenograft models described here.<br>
[0179] The mice for experiments were C57BL/6, DBF1 and BALB/c nude mice strains,<br>
provided by Academic Sinica, Experimental Animal Center, certification number: SCXK<br>
(Shanghai) 2003-0003. The mouse weight was between 18 and 22 g. Both male and female<br>
mice were used. However, for each experiment, animals of same sex were used. For the mouse<br>
transplanted tumor model, the numbers of animals tested were as follows: 10 for each dose<br>
group, 10 for positive control group and 20 for negative control group. For human tumor<br>
xenograft model, the numbers of animals tested were as follows: 6 for each dose group, 6 for<br>
positive control group and 12 for negative control group.<br>
[0180] Test control. For negative control, each mouse was administered intravenously with<br>
the solvent only having the same volume and same concentration as those used in high dose<br>
ACEA100108 test, once a day, for 7 consecutive days. For positive control group, an anticancer<br>
compound, Taxol was adniinistered intravenously at 10 mg/kg, once a day for 7 consecutive<br>
days. In a reference group, DBTS was administered intravenously at 50 mg/kg, once a day for 7<br>
consecutive days.<br>
[0181] Preparation and Administration of Test Compounds. Compound ACEA100108 was<br>
dissolved in hydrogenated castor oil (solvent) to have a compound ACEA100108 concentration<br>
of 20 mg/ml in the solvent. Each time before use, this solution was diluted in normal saline to<br>
achieve desired ACEA100108 concentrations. Each mouse (about 20 g in weight) was,<br>
administered intravenously with the compound solution of 0.5 mL at a controlled injection speed<br>
of 0.5 ml/0.5 min. 24 hrs after the tumor transplantation, intravenous injections of compound<br>
solutions into carrier mice were performed once a day, for consecutive 7 or 10 days. Different<br>
dosages of compound ACEA100108 between 100 and 6.25 mg/kg were used in the study.<br><br>
[0182] Preparation of Tumor cells for Transplantation and Determination of Compound<br>
Efficacy. To prepare the cancer cells for mouse Lewis lung cancer model, human breast cancer<br>
xenograft model and human colon cancer xenograft model, the fast growing tumors were first<br>
removed from the transplanted tumor mice. The tumor tissues were dissected and tumor cell<br>
suspensions were prepared in normal saline to have a concentration of 2-4 x 10 cells/ml.<br>
0.2 ml of cell suspension was subcutaneously injected into the axillary region (right-side) of<br>
each mouse. Twenty four hours after the transplantation, mice were administered with a given<br>
dose of ACEA100108, or with solvent only which serves as the negative control, or with 10<br>
mg/kg Taxol which served as positive control, or with 50 mg/kg DBTS which served as a<br>
reference test. Between two and four weeks after transplantation, mice were sacrificed and the<br>
transplanted tumors were removed from experimental mice. Each removed solid tumor was<br>
weighed; the tumor inhibition rate in each dosage group was calculated according to equation (2)<br>
in Example 1.<br>
[0183] For human tumor xenograft model, all used materials, including animal food, animal<br>
cage, supporting materials and apparatus contacted by animals, were high-pressure sterilized.<br>
Nude mice were maintained in laminar flow shelves under SPF condition. After tumor<br>
transplantation, mouse weight and tumor size in each compound dosage group were dynamically<br>
monitored and plotted. The tumor size was determined by measuring the major axis (a) and<br>
minor axis (b) of the tumor, and tumor volume was calculated according to the formula<br>
Tumor volume - a X b2 /2	(3)<br>
[0184] To prepare cancer cells for the P388 murine lymphocytic leukemia model, ascites of<br>
a P388 leukemia-bearing mouse were removed under sterile condition. The ascites were diluted<br>
in normal saline (1:6 for ascites to normal saline) to prepare cell suspension. 0.2 mL of the cell<br>
suspension was then injected intraperitoneally. Twenty four hours after transplanting the cancer<br>
cells into mice, mice were administered with given doses of a given dose of ACEA100108, or<br>
with solvent only which serves as the negative control, or with 10 mg/kg Taxol and with 2<br>
mg/kg MMC (mitomycin C) which served as positive controls, or with 50 mg/kg DBTS which<br>
served as a reference test. The life span of carrier mice was determined within 30 days. The life<br>
span ratio comparing to the negative control group of the carrier mice in each compound<br>
treatment group was calculated according to the formula:<br>
Life span ratio % = average life span for the compound treatment group / average life<br>
span for the negative control group X 100%	(4)<br><br>

vivo tumor inhibition rates of 60.15%, 55.35% and 34.32%, respectively, in 100 (administered<br>
only 5 times because of toxicity), 25 and 6.25 mg/kg dosage groups (relative to the solvent-only<br>
control). In the same experiment, DBTS showed the average in vivo tumor inhibition rates of<br>
63.10% and 57.93%, respectively, in 100 (administered only 5 times because of toxicity) and 25<br>

treated with compound ACEA100108 were 106.18%, 107.22% and 109.28%, respectively, in<br>
50,25 and 12.5 mg/kg dosage groups. In the same experiment, the average increase in life span<br>
of mice was 109.28% for the mice being treated with DBTS compound at a dosage of 50 mg/kg,<br>
and the average increase in life span of mice treated with 10 mg/kg Taxol compound was<br>
109.28%. The details are provided in Table 17.<br>
[0187] In Bcap-37 human breast cancer xenograft model in nude mice, ACEA100108<br>
showed the average in vivo tumor inhibition rates of 64.13%, 56.10% and 31.40%, respectively,<br>
in 50, 25 and 8 mg/kg dosage groups. In the same experiment, DBTS showed the average in<br>
vivo tumor inhibition rate of 66.98% for a 50 mg/kg dosage and Taxol showed an average in<br>
vivo tumor inhibition rate of 48.84% for the routine administration dosage of 10 mg/kg. The<br>
details are provided in Table 18 and Figure 16, describing an efficacy study of DBTS and ACEA<br>
100108 on Bcap-37 human breast cancer xenograft-transplanted in nude mice. In Figure 16, the<br>
seven rows (1-7, respectively) represent results from the following administered compounds: 1)<br>
negative control; 2) solvent; 3) ACEA 100108 (50 mg/kg); 4) ACEA 100108 (20 mg/kg); 5)<br>
ACEA 100108 (8 mg/kg); 6) DBTS (50 mg/kg); and 7) positive control (taxol, 10 mg/kg). The<br>
test compounds and controls were administered iv x 7qd. The dynamic changes of tumor size<br>
are summarized in Table 19 and Figure 17. The dynamic change of body weight of carrier mice<br>
results are summarized in Table 20 and Figure 18.<br>
[0188] In HCT-8 human lung cancer xenograft model in nude mice, ACEA100108 showed<br>
the average in vivo tumor inhibition rates of 45.62%, 28.10% and 15.03%, respectively, in 50, 25<br>
and 8 mg/kg dosage groups. In the same experiment, DBTS showed the average in vivo tumor<br>
inhibition rate of 46.08% for a 50 mg/kg dosage and Taxol showed an average in vivo tumor<br>
inhibition rate of 33.33% for the routine administration dosage of 10 mg/kg. The details are<br>
provided in Table 21 and Figure 19, describing an efficacy study of DBTS and ACEA 100108<br>
on HCT-8 human colon cancer xenograft transplanted in nude mice. In Figure 19, the seven<br><br>
rows (1-7, respectively) represent results from the following administered compounds: 1)<br>
negative control; 2) solvent; 3) ACEA 100108 (50 mg/kg); 4) ACEA 100108 (20 mg/kg); 5)<br>
ACEA 100108 (8 mg/kg); 6) DBTS (50 mg/kg); and 7) positive control (taxol, 10 mg/kg). The<br>
test compounds and controls were administered iv x 7qd. The dynamic changes of tumor size<br>
are summarized in Table 22 and Figure 20. The dynamic change of body weight of carrier mice<br>
results are summarized in Table 23 and Figure 21.<br>
[0189] Based on the results from the in vivo evaluation of two mouse tumor models and two<br>
humor tumor xenograft models, ACEA100108 may be effectively administered at 50 mg/kg and<br>
iv X 7qd. In addition, the anticancer effect of ACEA 100108 on mouse Lewis lung cancer model<br>
and Bcap-37 human breast cancer model is stronger than its effect on HCT-8 human colon<br>
cancer model. However, ACEA 100108 did not exhibit anticancer effect on P388 mouse<br>
leukemia model. Furthermore, for the same dosage and same drug-administration procedure, the<br>
anticancer effect for above models of compound ACEA100108 is comparable with that of<br>
DBTS, and is better than that of Taxol under routine treatment dosage conditions.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
EXAMPLE4<br>
In vivo Anticancer Activity of ACEA100108 on aolO/17 Human Ovarian Cancer in<br>
Nude Mice<br>
[0190] To evaluate the in vivo anticancer efficacy of compound ACEA100108, an aol0/17<br>
human ovarian cancer xenograft model in immunodeficient nude mice was used. The cell line<br>
and mice were maintained in the Pharmacology Lab of Shanghai Pharmaceutical Industry<br>
B<br>
Institute. For the aolO/17 human ovarian cancer xenograft models, cancer cells were passed<br>
twice in vivo before being transplanted into the nude mice for the study. In another word,<br>
cultured human ovarian cancer aolO/17 cells in flask were first xenograft-transplanted in<br>
immunodeficient nude mice. After the cancer cells grew to a tumor of certain sizes in the nude<br>
mice, the tumor was removed form the nude mice and tumor tissues were dissected. The cell<br>
suspensions were prepared from the dissected tumor tissue and transplanted back to<br>
immunodeficient nude mice again (i.e. the second passage of cancer cells in human cancer<br>
xenograft-transplanted model). After the cancer cells grew to certain size, the tumor was<br>
removed from nude mice and the tumor tissues were dissected. The cell suspensions were<br>
prepared from dissected tissues and were used for the study of human cancer xenograft models<br>
described here.<br>
[0191] The mice for experiments were C57BL/6, DBF1 and BALB/c (nude mice) strains,<br>
provided by Academic Sinica, Experimental Animal Center, certification number SCXK<br>
(Shanghai) 2003-0003. The mouse weight was between 18 and 22 g. Only female mice were<br>
used in this study. For human tumor xenograft model, the numbers of animals tested were as<br>
follows: 6 for each dose group, 6 for positive control group and 12 for negative control (solvent<br>
only) group. The high, middle and low doses of ACEA100108 were 50,25 and 8 mg/kg/d,<br>
respectively.<br>
[0192] Test control. For negative control, each mouse was administered intravenously with<br>
the solvent only having the same volume and same concentration as those used in high dose<br>
ACEA100108 test, once a day, for 7 consecutive days. For positive control group, an anticancer<br>
compound, Taxol was administered intravenously at 10 mg/kg, once a day for 7 consecutive<br><br>
days. In a reference group, DBTS was administered intravenously at 50 mg/kg, once a day for 7<br>
consecutive days.<br>
[0193] Preparation and Administration of Test Compounds. Compound ACEA100108 was<br>
dissolved in hydrogenated castor oil (solvent) to have a compound ACEA100108 concentration<br>
of 20 mg/ml in the solvent. Each time before use, this solution was diluted in normal saline to<br>
achieve desired ACEA100108 concentrations. Each mouse (about 20 g in weight) was<br>
administered intravenously with the compound solution of 0.5 mL at a controlled injection speed<br>
of 0.5 ml/0.5 min. 24 hrs after the tumor transplantation, intravenous injections of compound<br>
solutions into carrier mice were performed once a day, for consecutive 7 days. The high, middle<br>
and low dose of compound ACEA100108 was 50, 20 and 8 mg/kg, respectively.<br>
[0194] Preparation of Tumor Cells for Transplantation and Determination of Compound<br>
Efficacy. To prepare the cancer cells for human ovarian cancer xenograft model, the fast<br>
growing tumors were first removed from the transplanted tumor mice. The tumor tissues were<br>
grounded in normal saline (1:6 for tumor volume to saline volume) and tumor cell suspensions<br>
were prepared in the normal saline. 0.2 ml of cell suspension was subcutaneously injected into<br>
the axillary region (right-side) of each mouse. Twenty four hours after the transplantation, mice<br>
were administered with a given dose of ACEA100108, or with solvent only which serves as the<br>
negative control, or with 10 mg/kg Taxol which served as positive control, or with 50 mg/kg<br>
DBTS which served as a reference test. Between two and four weeks after transplantation, mice<br>
were sacrificed and the transplanted tumors were removed from experimental mice. Each<br>
removed solid tumor was weighed; the tumor inhibition rate in each dosage group was<br>
calculated according to equation (2) in Example 1.<br>
[0195] For the human ovarian cancer xenograft model, all used materials, including animal<br>
food, animal cage, supporting materials and apparatus contacted by animals, were high-pressure<br>
sterilized. Nude mice were maintained in laminar flow shelves under SPF condition. After<br>
tumor transplantation, mouse weight and tumor size in each compound dosage group were<br>
dynamically monitored and plotted. The tumor size was determined by measuring the major<br>
axis (a) and minor axis (b) of the tumor, and tumor volume was calculated according to the<br>
equation (3) in Example 3.<br>
[0196] Results. In aol 0/17 human ovarian cancer xenograft model in nude mice,<br>
ACEA100108 showed the average in vivo tumor inhibition rates of 53.40%, 46.67% and<br>
33.19%, respectively, in 50,25 and 8 mg/kg dosage groups. In the same experiment, DBTS<br>
showed the average in vivo tumor inhibition rate of 57.30% for a 50 mg/kg dosage and Taxol<br><br>
showed an average in vivo tumor inhibition rate of 45.39% for the routine administration dosage<br>
of 10 mg/kg. The details are provided in Table 24 and Figures 22, describing an efficacy study<br>
of DBTS and ACEA 100108 on aol0/17 human ovarian cancer xenograft-transplanted in nude<br>
mide. In Figure 22, the seven rows (1-7, respectively) represent results from the following<br>
administered compounds: 1) negative control; 2) solvent; 3) ACEA 100108 (50 mg/kg); 4)<br>
ACEA 100108 (20 mg/kg); 5) ACEA 100108 (8 mg/kg); 6) DBTS (50 mg/kg); and 7) positive<br>
control (taxol, 10 mg/kg). The test compounds and controls were administered iv at 7qd.<br>
[0197] The dynamic changes of tumor size are summarized in Table 25 and Figure 23. The<br>
dynamic change of body weight of carrier mice results are summarized in Table 26 and Figure<br>
24. For the same dosage and same drug-administration procedure, the anticancer effect of<br>
compound ACEA100108 in aolO/17 human ovarian cancer models is comparable with that of<br>
compound ACEA100101, and is better than that of Taxol under regular treatment dosage<br>
conditions.<br><br><br><br>
EXAMPLES<br>
In vivo Anticancer Activity of ACEA100108 on Bcap-37 Human Breast Cancer in<br>
Nude Mice<br>
[0198] To evaluate the in vivo anticancer efficacy of compound ACEA100108, Bcap-37<br>
human breast cancer xenograft model in immunodeficient nude mice was used. The cell line<br>
and mouse model are maintained in the Pharmacology Lab of Shanghai Pharmaceutical Industry<br>
Institute. For the Bcap-37 human breast cancer xenograft models, cancer cells were passed<br>
twice in vivo before being transplanted into the nude mice for the study. In another word,<br>
cultured human breast cancer Bcap-37 cells in flask were first xenograft-transplanted in<br>
immunodeficient nude mice. After the breast cancer cells grew to a rumor of certain sizes in the<br><br>
nude mice, the tumor was removed form the nude mice and tumor tissues were dissected. The<br>
cell suspensions were prepared from the dissected tumor tissue and transplanted back to<br>
immunodeficient nude mice again (i.e. the second passage of cancer cells in human cancer<br>
xenograft-transplanted model). After the cancer cells grew to certain size, the tumor was<br>
removed from nude mice and the tumor tissues were dissected. The cell suspensions were<br>
prepared from dissected tissues and were used for the study of human cancer xenograft models<br>
described here.<br>
[0199] The mice for experiments were BALB/c (nude mice) strains, provided by Academic<br>
Sinica, Experimental Animal Center, certification number: SCXK (Shanghai) 2003-0003. The<br>
mouse weight was between 18 and 22 g. Only female mice were used in this study. For human<br>
tumor xenograft model, the numbers of animals tested were as follows: 6 for each dose group, 6<br>
for positive control group and 12 for negative control (solvent only) group. The high, middle<br>
and low doses of ACEA100108 were 50,25 and 8 mg/kg/d, respectively.<br>
[0200] Test control. For negative control, each mouse was administered intravenously with<br>
the solvent only having the same volume and same concentration as those used in high dose<br>
ACEA100108 test, once a day, for 7 consecutive days. For positive control group, an anticancer<br>
compound, Taxol was administered intravenously at 10 mg/kg, once a day for 7 consecutive<br>
days.<br>
[0201] Preparation and Administration of Test Compounds. Compound ACEA100108 was<br>
dissolved in hydrogenated castor oil (solvent) to have a ACEA100108 concentration of 20<br>
mg/ml in the solvent. Each time before use, this solution was diluted in normal saline to achieve<br>
desired ACEA 100108 concentrations. Each mouse (about 20 g in weight) was administered<br>
intravenously with the compound solution of 0.5 mL at a controlled injection speed of 0.5 ml/0.5<br>
min. Seven days after the tumor transplantation, the transplanted tumors grew to size<br>
sufficiently large that could be felt by hands when one touched the animal. From that time on,<br>
intravenous injections of compound solutions into carrier mice were performed once a day, for<br>
consecutive 7 or 10 days. The high, middle and low dose of ACEA100108 was 50,20 and 8<br>
mg/kg, respectively.<br>
[0202] Preparation of Tumor cells for Transplantation and Determination of Compound<br>
Efficacy. To prepare the cancer cells for human breast cancer xenograft model, the fast growing<br>
tumors were first removed from the transplanted tumor mice. The tumor tissues were grounded<br>
in normal saline (1:6 for tumor volume to saline volume) and tumor cell suspensions were<br>
prepared in the normal saline having cell concentration of 2-4 x 107 cells/ml. 0.2 ml of cell<br><br>
suspension was subcutaneously injected into the axillary region (right-side) of each mouse.<br>
About seven days after the transplantation, tumors in the mice grew sufficiently large so that<br>
tumor could be felt by hands when one touched the animals. From that time on, mice were<br>
administered with a given dose of ACEA100108, or with solvent only which serves as the<br>
negative control, or with 10 mg/kg Taxol which served as positive control. Between three and<br>
four weeks after transplantation, mice were sacrificed and the transplanted tumors were removed<br>
from experimental mice. Each removed solid tumor was weighed; the tumor inhibition rate in<br>
each dosage group was calculated according to equation (2) in Example 1. Based on the tumor<br>
volume, another parameter, namely, tumor volume inhibition rate was also calculated, according<br>
to<br>
T/C (%) = average volume of tumor in the compound treated group / average weight of<br>
tumor in the negative control group X 100%	(5)<br>
[0203] For the human breast cancer xenograft model, all used materials, including animal<br>
food, animal cage, supporting materials and apparatus contacted by animals, were high-pressure<br>
sterilized. Nude mice were maintained in laminar flow shelves under SPF condition. After<br>
tumor transplantation, mouse weight and tumor size in each compound dosage group were<br>
dynamically monitored and recorded. The tumors size was determined by measuring the major<br>
axis (a) and minor axis (b) of the tumor, and tumor volume was calculated according to the<br>
equation (3) in Example 3.<br>
[0204] Results. In Bcap-37 human breast cancer xenograft model in nude mice,<br>
ACEA100108 showed the average in vivo tumor inhibition rates of 52.24%, 47.31% and<br>
28.21%, respectively, in 50,20 and 8 mg/kg dosage groups when the compound was<br>
administered according to iv X 7qd procedure. Furthermore, it showed the average in vivo<br>
tumor inhibition rates of 56.92% for 50 mg/kg dosage when the compound was administered<br>
according to 10 x qd procedure. In the same experiment, Taxol showed an average in vivo<br>
tumor inhibition rate of 44.33% for the routine administration dosage of 10 mg/kg. The details<br>
are provided in Table 27 and Figure 25, describing an efficacy study of ACEA 100108 on Bcap-<br>
37 human breat cancer xenograft-transplanted in nude mice. In Figure 25, the seven rows (1-7,<br>
respectively) represent results from the following administered compounds: 1) negative control;<br>
2) solvent; 3) ACEA 100108 (50 mg/kg); 4) ACEA 100108 (20 mg/kg); 5) ACEA 100108 (8<br>
mg/kg); 6) ACEA 100108 (50 mg/kg); and 7) positive control (taxol, 10 mg/kg). The test<br>
compounds and controls were administered iv at 7qd, except for ACEA 1001008 at 50 mg/kg,<br>
which was administered iv x lOqd. The result of tumor volume inhibition rates are shown in<br><br>
Table 28. The dynamic changes of tumor size are summarized in Table 26. The dynamic<br>
change of body weight of carrier mice results are summarized in Table 27.<br>
[0205] In the Bcap-3 7 human breast cancer xenograft model in nude mice, ACEA100108<br>
showed a tumor inhibition rate above 50% for a compound administration procedure in which<br>
compound was administered after the tumor grew to sufficient large so that the tumor could be<br>
felt by hands. Furthermore, when dosing times of the compound in the nude mice increased,<br>
there was no apparent increased toxic effect to mice, while there was increased tumor inhibition.<br>
In addition, the middle dosage of ACEA 100108 administered here into nude mice showed a<br>
better anticancer efficacy than that of the routine treatment dosage of Taxol.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
Acute Toxicity Test of DBTS and Compound ACEA100108 :<br>
Determination of the Intravenous Injection LDsn in Mice<br>
[0206] The experiments to test DBTS and ACEA100108 acute toxicity were performed in<br>
mice. The test mice were randomly divided into six groups (five dosing groups and one control<br>
group). Each group contained 20 Kunming strain mice, and among them, 50% were male and<br>
50% were female. After administration of a single dose of DBTS or ACEA100108 via<br>
intravenous injection (i.v.), the acute response to DBTS or ACEA100108 compound, and the<br>
death of the treated mice during the first two weeks were monitored and recorded. The LD50<br>
value was calculated using the Bliss method. The mouse single i.v. dose LD50 value of DBTS<br>
was 258.53 mg/kg (234.96 to 284.46 mg/kg), and the mouse single i.v. dose LD50 value of<br>
ACEA100108 was 316 mg/kg (284.26-351.28 mg/kg).<br>
[0207] Materials and Method. The test chemical compound were DBTS and ACEA100108,<br>
which were dissolved into hydrogenated castor oil in the pre-warmed water bath and made as a<br>
20 mg/ml solution. The solution was further diluted to desired experiment concentrations with<br>
the normal saline. The administration volume was 0.5 ml i.v. per mouse and the injection speed<br>
was 0.5ml/0.5 min.<br>
[0208] The experimental mice were Kunming strain, provided by the Experimental Animal<br>
Department, Shanghai Pharmaceutical Industry Institute. The certificate number of the facility<br>
was Animal Facility Certification Number 107. The average weight of the mice was 18-20<br>
gram. Each test group contained 20 Kunming strain mice, and among them, 10 mice were male<br>
and 10 mice were female. Five experimental doses were used, which were 400 mg/kg, 320<br><br>
mg/kg, 256 mg/kg, 204.8mg/kg and 163.8 mg/kg. The mice in the control group were only given<br>
the same volume of the solvent, which were diluted hydrogenated castor oil. All the testing mice<br>
were given a single intravenous injection of DBTS, ACEA100108, or the solvent that served as<br>
the control at the injection speed of 0.5 ml/0.5 min. The acute response to DBTS, ACEA100108<br>
or the solvent immediately after the administration, as well as weight change, and the death<br>
within the first two weeks of the administration were monitored and recorded. The intravenous<br>
injection LD50 values in mice were calculated using the Bliss method.<br>
[0209] Result. Immediately after intravenous injection, mice showed behavioral<br>
abnormalities, which included jumping, running, convulsion, and shortness of breath<br>
(accelerated respiration). At high dose groups, some mice died of convulsive seizure within 3<br>
min after the injection. The death occurred within one hour of the administration and the peak<br>
was at the 12th hour of the administration. No pathological abnormality in the organs of the dead<br>
mice was found by autopsy. The survival mice showed no severe toxic symptoms except early<br>
reduced activities and loose hair, which were gradually recovered, and there was no delayed<br>
toxic manifestations seen within the 14 day following up monitoring. Although survival mice<br>
were healthy and behaved normal, the mice showed weight loss to some degree. Based<br>
experimental data, the mouse single i.v. dose LD50 value of DBTS was 258.53 mg/kg (234.96 to<br>
284.56 mg/kg), and the mouse single i.v. dose LD50 value of ACEA100108 was 316 mg/kg<br>
(284.26-351.28 mg/kg). There was no significant difference in LD50 values between male mice<br>
and female mice (p value &gt; 0.05). The acute toxicity results for DBTS and ACEA100108 were<br>
summarized in Tables 31 and 32. To evaluate the possible toxic effect of the solvent on the<br>
mice, the mice in the control group were administered with the same volume of the solvent. The<br>
mice given the solvent showed early abnormal manifestations and weight loss to a degree less<br>
than the mice dosed with DBTS or ACEA100108. This suggests that the acute toxic effects seen<br>
in the dosing mice are related to DBTS or ACEA100108.<br><br><br><br>

EXAMPLE 20<br>
Inhibition of Cancer Cell Proliferation by DBTS and Its Derivatives<br>
[0223] The anticancer potency of DBTS and its derivatives were tested in 8 different types<br>
of human cancer cell lines using the RT-CES system and MTT assay. The 8 cancer cell lines<br>
were HT1080 (the human fibrosarcoma cell line), H460 (human non small cell lung cancer cell<br>
line), OVCAR4 (the human ovarian cancer cell line), MCF7 (human breast cancer cell line)<br>
MDA-MB231 (M231, the human breast cancer cell line) A2780 (the human colon cancer cell<br>
line) Jurkat (the human T cell leukemia cell line). The test DBTS derivatives include<br>
ACEA100107, ACEA100108, ACEA100109, ACEA100111, ACEA100115, ACEA100116,<br>
ACEA100117, ACEA100118, ACEA100119, and ACEA100120. ACEA100129 was also tested<br>
in HT1080, HELA and MCF7 cells, having an IC50 value of 0.82 uM, 0.42 uM and 2.3 uM,<br>
respectively. The chemical structures of the derivatives are shown in Tables 33 and 34.<br>
[0224] For the assay performed on the RT-CES system, the cells were seeded into the 16X<br>
or 96X microtiter plate devices (electronic plates, i.e., the plates comprise microelectrode sensor<br>
arrays in the wells of the plate) at the seeding density ranging from 5000 cells/well to 15,000<br>
cells/well. The cells were incubated at 5% CO2 and 37 °C for overnight till the cell indices<br>
reached the growth phase where the cell index was between 0.8 and 1.2. Serially diluted<br>
compounds were then added to the cells followed by dynamic monitoring of the effect of the<br>
compounds on the cell proliferation and cytotoxicity. The time-dependent IC50 values for each<br>
derivative were calculated based the dose responses of cell index value at different time points<br>
after compound treatment. The IC50 values shown in Table 35 corresponds to the time points at<br>
which compound showed the maximum inhibition after the treatment.<br>
[0225] For the MTT assay, the cells were seeded into the regular 96x well plates at the cell<br>
seeding density ranging from 5000 cells/well to 15,000 cells/well. The cells were incubated at<br>
5% CO2 and 37 °C for overnight. The derivatives were serially diluted and added to the cells.<br><br>
The treatment was terminated after 48 hours of incubation by adding MTT staining reagent.<br>
After 4 hours, the staining was stopped by the stop buffer and then the colorimetric measurement<br>
was carried out on a microtiter plate reader at dual wave length, 650 nm and 550 ran. The IC50<br>
values for tested derivatives were calculated using the colorimetric readouts and listed in Table<br>
36.<br><br><br><br><br>
EXAMPLE 21<br>
Kinetic inhibition of cancer cell proliferation by ACEA100108<br>
[0226] The anticancer potency of a DBTS derivative, ACEA100108 was tested in 7 cancer<br>
cell lines on the RT-CEA system. The cell lines were HT1080, H460, OVCAR4, MCF7, MDA-<br>
MB231, HepG2, and A2780. The cancer cells were seeded into 16X or 96X microtiter plate<br>
devices (i.e. electronic plates) containing wells at cell seeding density ranging from 5000<br>
cells/well to 15000 cells/well, and the seeded cells were then incubated at 37 °C, 5% C02. The<br>
cancer cell growth was monitored in real time on the RT-CES system till the cells reached the<br>
growth phase, which takes approximately 20 hours. Cells were then treated with ACEA100108<br>
which were serially diluted at the concentrations ranging from 50 uM to 0.38 uM. The inhibition<br>
of the cancer proliferation of ACEA100108 and cytotoxicity responses of various cell lines to<br>
ACEA100108 were monitored on the RT-CES system in real time. The kinetic curves of the<br>
cell-compound interaction was then recorded and shown in the Figure 26. The cell index curves<br>
were normalized against the cell index values at a time point just after compound addition<br>
(approximately 18-24 hrs after cell seeding).<br>

[0227] The kinetic inhibition of proliferation of HT1080 cancer cells and cytotoxicity effects<br>
of the DBTS derivatives on HT1080 cancer cells were measured on the RT-CES system. The<br>

ACEA100115, ACEA100116, ACEA100117, ACEA100118, ACEA100119, and ACEA100120,<br>
The HT1080 cells (human fibrosarcoma) were seeded into the wells of 16X or 96X microtiter<br>
plate devices (electronic plates) at the seeding density of 5000 cells/well. After 20 hour<br>
incubation at 5% CO2 and 37 °C till the cells reached the growth phase, the serially diluted<br>
DBTS-derivatives at the concentration ranging from 50 uM to 0.38 uM were added to the cells,<br>
and the cell response to the DBTS derivatives was monitored and recorded in real time for 48<br>
hours on the RT-CES system. Figure 27 shows the kinetic curves of interactions between cells<br>
and DBTS-derivatives at different concentrations. The cell index curves were normalized<br>
against the cell index values at a time point just after compound addition (approximately 18-24<br>
hrs after cell seeding).<br><br>
EXAMPLE 23<br>
Suppression of Microtubule Dynamics by DBTS and Its Derivative Compounds<br>
ACEA100108 and ACEAlOOl 16 Overview.<br>
[0228] Microtubules are important in numerous cellular processes, including mitosis when<br>
the duplicated chromosomes are separated into two identical sets before cleavage of the cell into<br>
two daughter cells. The key role of microtubules and their dynamics in mitosis and cell division<br>
make microtubules an important target for anticancer drugs. In cells during interphase,<br>
microtubules exchange their tubulin with soluble tubulin in the cytoplasmic pool with half times<br>
of ~3 minutes to several hours. With the onset of mitosis, the interphase microtubule network<br>
disassembles and is replaced by a population of highly dynamic microtubules which forms the<br>
mitotic spindle and moves the chromosomes. Mitotic spindle microtubules are 20-50 times more<br>
dynamic than microtubules in interphase cells, and some spindle microtubules exchange their<br>
tubulin with tubulin in the soluble pool with half-times as rapid as 15 seconds.<br>
[0229] The dynamics of mitotic spindle microtubules are exquisitely sensitive to modulation<br>
by regulators and to disruption by microtubule-active drugs. Microtubule-targeted drugs can<br>
alter microtubule polymerization and dynamics in a wide variety of ways. The mechanisms of<br>
action of three ACEA compounds designated as DBTS, ACEA100108, and ACEAlOOl 16 with<br>
respect to (1) the ability to influence the microtubule network in cultured cells, (2) the ability to<br>
influence microtubule assembly in vitro and (3) the ability to influence microtubule dynamics in<br>
vitro, are described below.<br>
Methods<br>
[0230] Cell Culture and hnmunocvtochemistrv. COS cells were grown in DMEM media<br>
supplemented with non-essential amino acids, 10% FBS, antibiotic-antimycotic (Gibco BRL) at<br>
37 °C and 5.5% CO2. For immunofluorescence microscopy, cells were plated on polylysine<br>
coated coverslips and treated with various concentrations of the three ACEA compounds,<br>
paclitaxel or vinblastine for either 4 or 24 hours (see individual figures for concentrations used<br>
in any given experiment). Cells were then rinsed once with warm PBS, fixed with cold<br>
methanol, rinsed again in PBS and blocked overnight at 4 °C in PBT (PBS, 1% BSA, 0.5%<br>
Triton X-100). All subsequent stains and washes were done in PBT at room temperature unless<br>
stated otherwise. Cells were stained with the anti-tubulin mouse antibody DM-1 at 1:1000 for 1<br>
hour, washed four times for 15 minutes each and then treated with Cy-3 conjugated goat anti<br>
mouse antibody at 1:100 for 1 hour in the dark. Next, samples were washed four times for 15<br><br>
minutes each in PBT in the dark followed by a final 15 minute wash in PBS in the dark. Samples<br>
were then viewed by laser scanning confocal microscopy.<br>
[0231] Microtubule Assembly Assays. Microtubule seeds were synthesized by incubating<br>
purified bovine brain tubulin with 1 mM GTP, 10% glycerol and 10% DMSO at 35 °C. for 30<br>
minutes, followed by shearing by passing the assembled microtubules 6 times through a 27<br>
gauge needle. Microtubule assembly was assayed by adding 27.5 ul of microtubule seeds to<br>
spectrophotometer cuvettes (maintained at 35 °C.) containing 247.5 ul purified bovine brain<br>
tubulin in a PEM-100 buffer (100 mM Pipes pH = 6.8,1 mM EDTA, 1 mM MgS04)<br>
supplemented with 1 mM GTP (and drug where applicable) and monitoring the OD400 for 2<br>
hours. Since the compounds are dissolved in DMSO and DMSO can have a significant effect on<br>
microtubule assembly, DMSO was added to all cuvettes so as to equal the largest volume of<br>
drug added to reactions. It should be noted that the initial velocity of the microtubule assembly<br>
reactions is so fast that one can not always catch the initial rise on the light scattering profile<br>
because it is occurring while samples are being prepared. However, all samples start at the same<br>
optical density, since they are identical with the exception of the drug being introduced.<br>
[0232] Tubulin Purification and Microtubule Dynamics Assays. Tubulin was purified, as<br>
described in the literature ("Kinetic stabilization of microtubule dynamic instability in vitro by<br>
vinblastine", Toso, R. J., Jordan, M. A., Farrell, K. W., Matsumoto, B. and Wilson, L.,<br>
Biochemistry, 1993,32,1285-1293). Briefly, microtubule-associated protein-rich bovine brain<br>
microtubule protein was prepared by three cycles of assembly and disassembly. Tubulin was<br>
purified from other microtubule proteins by elution through a Whatman P-l 1 phosphocellulose<br>
column equilibrated in PEM50 (50 mM Pipes, 1 mM MgS04,1 mM EGTA, 0.1 mM GTP).<br>
Purified tubulin (&gt;99% pure) was drop-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -70 °C. Purified<br>
tubulin (15 uM tubulin dimer) was polymerized at the ends of sea urchin (Strong)docentrotus<br>
purpuratus) axonemal seeds at 37 °C in the presence or absence of ACEA 01, 08 or 16 in<br>
PMEM buffer (87 mM Pipes, 36 mM MES, 1.4 mM MgCl2,1 mM EDTA, pH 6.8) and 2 mM<br>
GTP. The dynamics of individual microtubules were recorded at 37 °C using differential<br>
interference contrast enhanced video microscopy. The ends were designated as plus or minus on<br>
the basis of the growth rate, the number of microtubules that grew at opposite ends of the seeds,<br>
and the relative lengths of the microtubules (Panda, D., Goode, B. L., Feinstein, S. C. and<br>
Wilson, L., Kinetic stabilization of microtubule dynamics at steady state by tau and microtubule-<br>
binding domains of tau, Biochemistry, 1995,3^, 111 17-11127; Walker, R. A., O'Brien, E. T.,<br>
Pryer, N. K., Soboeiro, M. F., Voter, W. A., Erickson, H. P. and Salmon, E. D., Dynamic<br><br>
instability of individual microtubules analyzed by video light microscopy: rate constants and<br>
transition frequencies, J. Cell Biol. 1988,107,1437-1448). Plus ends were analyzed for 10<br>
minutes per slide during the steady-state phase of polymerization (-45 min after initiation of<br>
polymerization). Life histories of individual microtubules were collected as described by Panda<br>
et al. 1995 (Panda, D., Goode, B. L., Feinstein, S. C. and Wilson, L., Kinetic stabilization of<br>
microtubule dynamics at steady state by tau and microtubule-binding domains of tau,<br>
Biochemistry, 1995, 34 11117-11127.) with modifications. Data points were collected at 1-3 s<br>
intervals.<br>
[0233] A microtubule was considered to be growing or shortening if it increased or<br>
decreased in length at a rate &gt;0.5 urn/min. microtubules exhibiting growth rates of 
over a period greater than 30 s were considered to be in an attenuated state. Average rates,<br>
lengths and durations are the averages of independent events. The catastrophe frequency was<br>
calculated by dividing the number of shortening events by the total time of growth and<br>
attenuation tracked, and rescue frequency was calculated by dividing the number of rescue<br>
events by the total time of shortening tracked. To control for experimental error, each condition<br>
was filmed over multiple days using at least two distinct tubulin/GTP mixtures (2-3 slides each).<br>
No gross variation in microtubule dynamics was observed between mixtures or slides of a given<br>
condition. The concentration of drug used in dynamic instability assays was chosen by initially<br>
observing microtubules stabilized with half the concentration used in microtubule assembly<br>
assays. If most microtubules on a slide were stable, the concentration of drug would be reduced<br>
until any given microtubule tracked would have at least two growth or shortening events in the<br>
span of 10 minutes.<br>
[0234J Figures 28-38 show the effect of DBTS and organosulfur compounds ACEA100108<br>
and ACEA 100116 on microtubule network in cultured cells. Figure 28 shows images of<br>
microtubules in control cells exposed to no drugs. The microtubule networks appear as<br>
expected. Figure 29 shows images of microtubules in cells exposed to taxol for 4 hours.<br>
Microtubules appear bundled in some locations; with increasing concentration, bundling appears<br>
more extensive but the microtubules often appear shorter than in the control cells. Figure 30<br>
shows images of microtubules in cells exposed to taxol for 24 hours. With increasing dosage,<br>
microtubule abnormalities increase. As this figure shows, there is increased bundling and the<br>
short microtubules persist. Additionally, major cellular abnormalities become apparent.<br>
[0235] Figure 31 shows images of microtubules in cells exposed to vinblastine for 4 hours.<br>
With increasing dosage, the microtubule network begins to fall apart and the microtubules<br><br>
become much shorter. Figure 32 shows images of microtubules in cells exposed to vinblastine<br>
for 24 hours. As this figure shows, major cell abnormalities are widespread in the microtubulue<br>
network.<br>
[0236] Figure 33 shows images of microtubules in cells exposed to DBTS for 4 hours. The<br>
microtubule network is completely disrupted; only very short microtubules exist and the overall<br>
level of tubulin in microtubules appears to be significantly reduced. This effect could be<br>
quantitated biochemically by non-ionic detergent extraction and immunoblotting. Figure 34<br>
shows images of microtubules in cells exposed to DBTS for 24 hours. At the lowest dosage,<br>
there are some microtubules present and the cells appear to have partially recovered when<br>
compared to cells exposed to the drug for only 4 hours; no cells are viable after treatment for 24<br>
hours with either 6 uM or 18 uM of DBTS.<br>
[0237] Figure 35 shows images of microtubules in cells exposed to ACEA100108 for 4<br>
hours. Similar to DBTS, the microtubule network is markedly altered at all concentrations<br>
tested. Microtubules are very short and the overall level of microtubule content appears to be<br>
reduced. At the highest concentration, cells often round up. Figure 36 shows images of<br>
microtubules in cells exposed to ACEA100108 for 24 hours. At both 1 uM and 3 uM, the cells<br>
seem to have made somewhat of a recovery between 4 and 24 hours. The microtubule networks<br>
in both cases appear relatively normal. However, at 9 uM, the microtubules appear short and the<br>
network is abnormal.<br>
[0238] Figure 37 shows images of microtubules in cells exposed to ACEA100116 for 4<br>
hours. Remnants of the microtubule network remain at 1 uM, but at the two higher<br>
concentrations, microtubules appear very short and abnormal. Cells are not elongated but rather<br>
appear to round up in a dose-dependent manner. Figure 38 shows images of microtubules in<br>
cells exposed to ACEA100116 for 24 hours. Cells treated with only 1 uM ACEA100116 appear<br>
relatively normal; essentially all cells treated with 3 uM or 9 uM were dead after 24 hours of<br>
exposure to ACEA100116.<br>
[0239] Figures 39-41 show the effect of DBTS and organosulfur compounds ACEA 100108<br>
and ACEA 100116 on microtubule assembly in vifro. As shown in Figure 39a, all doses of<br>
DBTS inhibit the extent of microtubule assembly significantly. The effect is especially<br>
prominent at 9 uM. Microtubule structure of both the control (Figure 39b) and drug treated<br>
(Figure 39c) samples were visualized by electron microscopy. As shown in Figure 40, lower<br>
dosages of ACEA100108 had minimal effects upon microtubule assembly. In contrast, 27 uM<br>
ACEA100108 had a marked inhibitory effect upon the extent of microtubule assembly.<br><br>
[0240] As shown in Figure 41, ACEA100116 is very different that DBTS and<br>
ACEA100108. Whereas the other two drugs inhibit microtubule assembly, ACEA100116<br>
promotes microtubule assembly. This is apparent at both 9 uM and 27 uM. This plot also<br>
exhibits a common, but not well understood, phenomena known as "overshooting" in which the<br>
light scattering pattern does not plateau but rather steadily declines. Nonetheless, it is clear that<br>
ACEA100116 promotes rather than inhibits microtubule assembly in vitro.<br>
[0241] Furthermore, DBTS, ACEA 100108 and ACEA 100116 were shown to influence<br>
microtubule behavior in vitro. As seen in Table 37, all three drugs altered the pattern of<br>
microtubule dynamics. DBTS did not affect the microtubule growth rate but did increase the<br>
average duration of growth events and consequently the average length grown in a growth event.<br>
It also increased the percentage of time spent growing. The average length of shortening events<br>
was also reduced.<br>
[0242] ACEA 100108 also increased the duration of growth events and the average length of<br>
growth events; it also had a strong effect upon the length of shortening events; this effect was<br>
even more pronounced than that of DBTS and ACEA100116 exhibited significantly different<br>
effects than either of the other two drugs. ACEA100116 increased the growth rate but had little<br>
effect upon the length of growing events. It had no effect upon the rate of shortening, but had a<br>
strong effect upon the length of shortening events. While the cell imaging data can not<br>
distinguish between the drugs binding to tubulin or microtubule associated proteins, the in vitro<br>
microtubule assembly and in vitro microtubule dynamics assays both used only purified, MAP-<br>
free tubulin. These observations demonstrate that all three drugs interact directly with tubulin.<br><br><br>

ACEA100108 Induces Apoptosis in Cancer Cells<br>
[0243] To test if ACEA100108 compound induces apoptosis in cancer cells, the A549<br>
human lung cancer cells were treated with luM ACEA100108 and 50 nM paclitaxel or 10 nM<br>
vinblastine. Paclitaxel and vinblastine, the two suppressors of microtubule dynamics were used<br>
as the positive control. A549 cells were seeded in chamber slides at a density of 10,000<br>
cells/well and 18 hours later were treated with the indicated concentrations of the anti-mitotic<br>
compounds ACEA100108, paclitaxel and vinblastine. The cells were incubated with the drugs<br>
for 24 hours and then washed 2X with PBS and 3X with binding buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.5,<br>
140 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM CaCl2). The Cells were stained with lug/mL Annexin V-Cy3 conjugate<br>
(Red, staining the cells that are starting apoptotic process) and 500 uM 6- CFDA (Green,<br>
staining the viable cells) in IX binding buffer for 20 minutes. The cells were gently washed 3X<br>
in IX binding buffer, mounted, viewed under immunofluorescent microscope and imaged using<br>
an attached CCD camera. Note that live cells show staining only with 6-CFDA (green), while<br>
necrotic cells will stain only with Annexin V-Cy3 (red). Cells starting the apoptotic process will<br>
stain both with AnnexinV-Cy3 and 6-CFDA.<br>
[0244] As shown in Figure 42, the cells treated with ACEA100108, paclitaxel, and<br>
vinblastine showed strong staining of Annexin V, while the control cells which were only<br><br>
treated with DMSO showed no Annexin V staining. This indicates that ACEA100108 induces<br>
apoptosis in A549 human lung cancer cells.<br>
EXAMPLE 25<br>
ACEA100108 Induces G2/M Cell-cycle Arrest in Cancer Cells<br>
[0245] Microtubules are extremely important in the process of mitosis, during which the<br>
duplicated chromosomes of a cell are separated into two identical sets before cleavage of the cell<br>
into two daughter cells. Compounds which target microtubules such as paclitaxel, and<br>
vinblastine suppress the microtubule dynamics and block the process of mitosis. As<br>
consequence, cells will be arrested at G2/M phase. To test if ACEA100108 influences the<br>
process of mitosis in cancer cell dividing, A549 human lung cancer cells were treated with 25<br>
uM ACEA100108 and 7.8 nM paclitaxel, and the cell-cycle effects of the compounds were<br>
detected by flow cytometry.<br>
10246] In briefly, A549 cells were seeded at a density of 500,000 cells in 60 mm tissue<br>
culture dishes. Approximately 18 hours later the cells were treated with the indicated<br>
concentrations of anti-mitotic compounds and allowed to further incubate for 24 hours. The cells<br>
were washed in PBS, trypsinized, counted and fixed in ice-cold 70 % methanol and stored at 4<br>
°C. The cells were washed with PBS, stained with propidium iodide and kept on ice until flow<br>
cytometry analysis. As shown in Figure 43, the cell population at G2/M phase increased<br>
significantly in cells treated with both ACEA100108 and paclitaxel, compared with the cells<br>
treated with DMSO only.<br>

[0252] The asymmetric trisulfides 41-68 (Scheme 3) can be synthesized by Method B<br>
similar to the reported procedure (Derbesy, G.; Harpp, D. N. Tetrahedron Letters, 1994, 35,<br>
5381-5384). For example, a solution of phenylthiol (C6H5CH2SH) (10 mmol) and anhydrous<br>
pyridine (10 mmol) in 25 mL of diethyl ether is added drop wise over a period of 30 minutes to a<br>
cold (-78 °C) stirred solution of sulfur dichloride (10 mmol) in 50 mL of anhydrous diethyl<br>
ether. The reaction mixture is stirred for 30 minutes. The corresponding second thiol (10 mmol)<br>
and anhydrous pyridine (10 mmol) in 25 mL of diethyl ether is added dropwise over a period of<br>
30 minutes at -78 °C, and the reaction mixture is further stirred for an additional 30 minutes. The<br>
reaction mixture is washed with water (2 times), 1 N sodium hydroxide solution (2 times), and<br>
then water (2 times) until pH is neutral. The organic phase is dried over CaCb, or anhydrous<br>
sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated. The residue is passed through a short pad of silica gel<br>
using hexanes-ethyl acetate as eluent to provide high purity products 41-68 in 40-100% yields.<br>
