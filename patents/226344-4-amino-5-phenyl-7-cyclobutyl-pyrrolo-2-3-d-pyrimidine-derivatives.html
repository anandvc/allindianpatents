The efficacy of the compounds of the invention as inhibitors of IGF-IR tyrosine kinase activity can be demonstrated using a cellular -CaptuR6ELISA-. In this assay the activity of the compounds of the invention against Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) induced autophosphoryla-tion of the IGF-IR is determined. The assay is conducted as follows: For the assay NIH-3T3 mouse fibroblasts transfected with human IGF-IR cDNA (complete human IGF-IR cDNA: GenBank Ace. No. NM_000875). prepared as described in Kato et al.. J. Biol. Chem. 268, 2655-61.1993. areused. The cells which overexpress human IGF-IR arecultured in Dulbecco*s minimal essential (DMEM) medium, containing 10 % Fetal Calf Serum (FCS). For the assay 5,000 cells/well areplated on day 1 on 96-well plates (Costar #3595) in normal growth medium and incubated for 2 days at 37**C in a standard CO2 cell incubator. The density of the cells does not exceed 70-80 % at day 3. On day 3 the medium is discarded and the cells areincubated for 24 h in minimal medium (DMEM. containing 0.5 % FCS). Compounds of formula I [starting from 10 mM dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) stock solutions] areadded to produce final concentrations of 0.01, 0.03, 0.1. 0.3,1. 3 and 10 |iM to determine the IC50 value. The cells areincubated for 90 min in the presence of a compound of formula I. Thereafter the cells arestimulated with 50 |il IGF-I (final concentration of IGF-I in the well = 10 ng/ml; IGF-I is obtained from Sigma; Product Code: I 3769) and incubated for 10min at 37oC.<br>
The medium is discarded and the cells arewashed twice with PBS/0 (=Phosphate-Buffered Saline without CaCl2) and lysed for 15 min on ice with 50µl/well RIPA-buffer [50 mM<br><br>
Tris'HCI, pH=7.2,120 mM NaCI. 1 mM EDTA, 6 mM EGTA, 1% NP-40, 20 mM NaF. 1 mM benzamidine. 15 mM sodium pyrophosphate. 1 mM Phenyl methyl sulphonyl fluoride (PMSF) and 0.5 mM Na3VO4] and shaken for 10 min using a 96-well plate shaker (=cellular extracts).<br>
Packard HTRF-96 black plates arecoated with 50 µl IGF-IR monoclonal Antibody (mAB) (Santa Cruz; Cat. No.: SC-462) in a concentration of 5 µg/ml at 4°C  overnight. The plates arewashed twice with 0.05% (v/v) Tween-20 in Phosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS) and once with nanopureH2O. Blocking is done for 2 h at room temperatuR6(RT) with 3% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) in TBS-T buffer (20 mM Tris-HCI. pH=7.6,137 mM NaCl, 0.05 % Tween-20). After blocking, the plates arewashed once with nanopureH2O.<br>
Cellular extracts (40 µl/well) arepipetted onto the precoated Packard plates, together with 40 µl of the anti-phosphotyrosine mouse mAB PY-20 conjugated with Alkaline Phosphatase (AP) (1:1000 diluted in RIPA buffer; the antibody is obtained from Transduction Labs; Cat. No.:P11120).<br>
After incubating the extracts and the secondary antibody for 2 h at 4 °C . the extracts arediscarded, the plates arewashed twice with 0.05% (v/v) Tween-20 in PBS and once with nanopurewater.<br>
90 µl/well AP substrate (CDP-Star; obtained from Tropix; Cat. No.: MS100RY) arethen added and the plates areincubated for 45 min at RT in the dark, followed by measuring AP activity in a Packard Top Count Microplate Scintillation Counter. The IC50 values for the compounds of formula I arecalculated via linear regression analysis using the GraphPad In-stat program (GraphPad Software. USA). IC50 values in the range of 5 nM to 1 jiM. especially in the range of 5 nM to 300 nM arefound.<br>
In vivo activity in the nude mouse xenotransplant model: female BALB/c nude mice (8-12 weeks old, Novartis Animal Farm. Sissein, Switzeriand) arekept under sterile conditions with water and feed ad libitum. Tumours areinduced by subcutaneous injection of tumour cells (human epithelial cell line A-431; American Type CultuR6Collection (ATCC). Rockville, MD. USA. Catalogue Number ATCC CRL 1555; cell line from an 85-year-old woman; epidermoid carcinoma cell line) into carrier mice. The resulting tumours pass through at least three consecutive transplantations befoR6the start of treatment. Tumour fragments (about 25 mg) areimplanted subcutaneously in the left flank of the animals using a 13-gauge trocar needle under Forene anaesthesia (Abbott, Switzeriand). Treatment with the test compound is started as soon as the tumour has reached a mean volume of 100 mm3. Tumour growth is meas-<br><br>
ured two to three times a week and 24 hours after the last treatment by determining the length of two perpendicular axes. The tumour volumes arecalculated in accordance with published methods (see Evans et a!., Brit. J. Cancer 45, 466-8,1982). The anti-tumour efficacy is determined as the mean increase in tumour volume of the treated animals divided by the mean increase in tumour volume of the untreated animals (controls) and. after multiplication by 100, is expressed as T/C%. Tumour regression (given in %) is reported as the smallest mean tumour volume in relation to the mean tumour volume at the start of treatment. The test compound is administered daily by gavage.<br>
As an alternative to cell line A-431, other cell lines may also be used in the same manner, for example:<br>
-	the MCF-7 breast adenocarcinoma cell line (ATCC No. HTB 22; see also J. Natl. Cancer Inst. (Bethesda) 51, 1409-16. 1973); and<br>
-	the DU145 prostate carcinoma cell line DU 145 (ATCC No. HTB 81; see also Cancer Res. 37.4049-58.1978).<br>
On the basis of these studies, a compound of formula I according to the invention shows therapeutic efficacy especially against proliferative diseases responsive to an inhibition of the IGF-IR tyrosine kinase.<br>
In general, the invention relates also to the use of a compound of formula I for the inhibition of the IGF-IR tyrosine kinase.<br>
In addition to the inhibition of the IGF-IR tyrosine kinase, the compounds of formula I also inhibit the tyrosine kinase activity of the receptor tyrosine kinase Flt-3. The compounds of formula I aretherefoR6also useful for the treatment of proliferative diseases, especially tumour diseases, responsive to an inhibition of the Flt-3 tyrosine kinase receptor. Such tumour diseases include e.g. leukemias and myelodysplastic syndrome. Aben'ant expression of the Flt-3 gene has been documented in both adult and childhood leukemias including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). AML with trilineage myelodysplasia (AMUTMOS), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The compounds of formula I aretherefoR6suitable for the treatment of these diseases, especially for the treatment of AML since activating mutations of the Flt-3 receptor have been found in about 35% of patients with AML, and areassociated with a poor prognosis.<br><br>
The Flt-3 inhibitory activity of a compound of formula I can be shown in a tyrosine kinase inhibition assay using the cytoplasmic kinase domain of Flt-3. The assay is performed as follows: The baculovirus donor vector pFbacGd (GIBCO) is used to generate a recombinant baculovirus that expresses the amino acid region amino acids 563-993 of the intra-cytoplasmic kinase domain of human Flt-3. The coding sequence for the cytoplasmic domain of Flt-3 is amplified by PCR from human c-DNA libraries (Clontech). The amplified DNA fragments and the pFbacGOl vector aremade compatible for ligation by digestion with BamHI and Hindlll. Ligation of these DNA fragments results in the baculovirus donor plas-mid Flt-3(1.1). The production of the viruses, the expression of proteins in Sf9 cells and the purification of the GST-fused proteins areperformed as follows:<br>
Production of virus: Transfer vector (pFbacGO!-Flt-3) containing the Flt-3 kinase domain is transfected into the DHIOBac cell line (GIBCO) and the cells areplated on selective agar plates. Colonies without insertion of the fusion sequence into the viral genome (carried by the bacteria) areblue. Single white colonies arepicked and viral DNA (bacmid) is isolated from the bacteria by standard plasmid purification procedures. Sf9 or Sf21 cells (American Type CultuR6Collection) arethen transfected in 25 cm^ flasks with the viral DNA using Cellfectin reagent.<br>
Determination of small scale protein expression in Sf9 cells: Virus containing media is collected from the transfected cell cultuR6and used for infection to increase its titer. Virus containing media obtained after two rounds of infection is used for large-scale protein expression. For large-scale protein expression 100 cm2 round tissue cultuR6plates areseeded with 5x107 cells/plate and infected with 1 mL of virus-containing media (approx. 5 MOIs). After 3 days the cells arescraped off the plate and centrifuged at 500 rpm for 5 min. Cell pellets from 10-20,100 cm2 plates, areresuspended in 50 mL of ice-cold lysis buffer (25 mMTris-HCI, pH 7.5. 2 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40,1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF). The cells arestin-ed on ice for 15 min and then centrifuged at 5000 rpms for 20 min.<br>
Purification of GST-tagged proteins: The centrifuged cell lysate is loaded onto a 2 mL glu-tathione-sepharose column (Pharmacia) and washed three times with 10 mL of 25 mM Tris-HCI. pH 7.5, 2 mM EDTA. 1 mM DTT. 200 mM NaCI. The GST-tagged protein is then eluted by 10 applications (1 mL each) of 25 mM Tris-HCI. pH 7.5. 10 mM reduced-glutathione, 100 mM NaCI. 1 mM DTT. 10 % Glycerol and stored at -70oC.<br>
MeasuR6of enzyme activity: Tyrosine protein kinase assays with purified GST-Flt-3 arecarried out in a final volume of 30 µL containing 200-1800 ng of enzyme protein (depending on the specific activity). 20 mM Tris-HCI. pH 7.6, 3 mM MnCb, 3 mM MgCI2, 1 mM DTT, 10µM<br><br>
Na3VO4. 3µg/mL poly(Glu,Tyr) 4:1.1 % DMSO, 8.0 nM ATP and 0.1 µCi [Y33 P] ATP. The activity is assayed in the presence or absence of inhibitors, by measuring the incorporation of 33P from [y33P] ATP into the poly(Glu Jyr) substrate. The assay (30 µL) is carried out in 96-well plates at ambient temperatuR6for 20 min under conditions described below and terminated by the addition of 20µL of 125 mM EDTA.

In the additional process steps, carried out as desired, functional groups of the starting compounds which should not take part in the reaction may be present in unprotected form or may be protected for example by one or moR6protecting groups. The protecting groups arethen wholly or partly removed according to one of the known methods. Protecting groups, and the manner in which they areintroduced and removed aredescribed, for example, in -Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry-, Plenum Press, London, New York 1973, and in -Methoden der organischen Chemie-, Houben-Weyl, 4th edition, Vol. 15/1, Georg-Thieme-Verlag, Stuttgart 1974 and in Theodora W. Greene, -Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis-, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York 1981. A characteristic of protecting groups is that they can be removed readily, i.e. without the occurrence of undesired secondary reactions, for example by solvolysis, reduction, photolysis or alternatively under physiological conditions.<br>
The end products of formula I may however also contain substituents that can also be used as protecting groups in starting materials for the preparation of other end products of formula I. Thus, within the scope of this text, only a readily removable group that is not a constituent of the particular desired end product of formula I is designated a -protecting group-, unless the context indicates otherwise.<br>
A compound of formula I can be converted to a corresponding N-oxide. The reaction is carried out with a suitable oxidizing agent, preferably a peroxide, for example m-chloroperbenzoic acid, in a suitable solvent, e.g. halogenated hydrocarbon, typically chloroform or dichloromethane. or in a lower alkanecarboxylic acid, typically acetic acid, preferably at a temperatuR6between 0oC and the boiling temperatuR6of the reaction mixture, especially at about RT.<br>
