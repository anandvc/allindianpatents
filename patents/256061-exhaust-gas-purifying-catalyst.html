3.	PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is  to be performed : -<br><br>
[Technical Field]<br>
The present invention relates to an exhaust gas purifying catalyst. More particularl) the present invention relates to a catalyst which exhibits high catalytic activity at lov temperature (hereinafter referred to as "low-temperature activity") and excellent hea resistance, and which can attain consistent exhaust gas purification performance; foi example, a catalyst which removes toxic components contained in exhaust gas discharged from an internal combustion engine of, for example, an automobile.<br>
[Background Art]<br>
Exhaust gas discharged from an internal combustion engine of, for example, an automobile contains toxic components such as hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), and nitrogen oxides (NOx). Hitherto, ternary catalysts have been used for removing such toxic components for detoxifying the exhaust gas.<br>
Some ternary catalysts are produced by applying, onto a honeycomb carrier made of, for example, a ceramic or metallic material, a certain combination of a noble metal (e.g., Pt, Pd, or Rh), and alumina, ceria, zirconia, or a composite oxide thereof. For example, there has been proposed an exhaust gas purifying catalyst containing a composite oxide having an apatite-type structure (see, for example, Patent Documents 1 and 2).<br>
However, such a conventional ternary catalyst generally poses problems in that the catalyst does not initiate removal of toxic components contained in exhaust gas until a relatively high temperature, and thus the catalyst may fail to satisfactorily remove the toxic components at a low temperature. For example, such a conventional ternary may fail to satisfactorily remove toxic components contained in exhaust gas discharged from an engine of, for example, an automobile, since the catalyst is in a relatively low temperature state immediately after starting of the engine.<br><br>
Also, such a conventional ternary catalyst generally poses problems in that the catalyst may exhibit lowered exhaust gas purification performance due to deterioration resulting from use in a relatively high temperature range, and the catalyst may fail to attain consistent exhaust gas purification performance over a low to high temperature range.<br>
Therefore, demand has arisen for a ternary catalyst which attains exhaust gas purification effect in a relatively low temperature state, and which also attains gas purification performance in a high temperature range. The present inventors have previously proposed an exhaust gas purifying catalyst which contains a composite oxide represented by (Laa-xMx)(Si6-yNy)027-z and a noble metal component that forms a solid solution with the composite oxide or is supported on the composite oxide, which exhibits high low-temperature activity and excellent heat resistance, and which can attain consistent exhaust gas purification performance (see Patent Document 3).<br>

[Summary of the Invention]<br>
[Problems to be Solved by the Invention]<br>

can attain consistent exhaust gas purification performance, and which exhibits exhaust gas purification performance higher than that of the previously proposed catalyst formed of (Laa-xMx)(Si6-yNy)027-z.<br>
[Means for Solving the Problems]<br>
The present inventors have conducted extensive studies for achieving the aforementioned object, and as a result have found that the object is attained by employing a noble metal component and a composite oxide represented by the following formula (Aa-w-xMwM,x)(Si6-yNy)027-z; i.e., a composite oxide in which A site is partially substituted by M and further by M1 (i.e., a third component), or a composite oxide in which A site is not necessarily substituted by M1 when A is Pr. The present invention has been accomplished on the basis of this finding.<br>

fModes for Carrying Out the Invention]<br>
Embodiments of the present invention will next be described in detail.<br>
The exhaust gas purifying catalyst of the present invention comprises:<br><br>
a composite oxide having an apatite structure and represented by the following formula:<br>
(Aa-w-xMwM'x)(Si6-yNy)027-z<br>
wherein A is a cation of at least one element selected from the group consisting of La and Pr; M is a cation of at least one element selected from the group consisting of Ba, Ca, and Sr; M' is a cation of at least one element selected from the group consisting of Nd, Y, Al, Pr, Ce, Sr, Li, and Ca; N is a cation of at least one element selected from the group consisting of Fe, Cu, and Al; and the following relations are satisfied: 6 
a noble metal ingredient which forms a solid solution with the composite oxide or is supported on the composite oxide.<br>
When A is a cation of La, the composite oxide forming the exhaust gas purifying catalyst of the present invention is represented by the following formula: (Laa-w.xMwM,x)(Si6-yNy)027-z<br>
wherein M is a cation of at least one element selected from the group consisting of Ba, Ca, and Sr; M' is a cation of at least one element selected from the group consisting of Nd, Y, Al, Pr, Ce, Sr, Li, and Ca; N is a cation of at least one element selected from the group consisting of Fe, Cu, and Al; and the following relations are satisfied :6<a x and z></a>
When A is a cation of Pr, the composite oxide forming the exhaust gas purifying catalyst of the present invention is represented by the following formula:<br>
(Pra-w-xMwM'x) (Si6-yNy)027-z<br>
wherein M is a cation of at least one element selected from the group consisting of Ba, Ca, and Sr; M' is a cation of at least one element selected from the group consisting of Nd, Y, Al, Ce, Sr, Li, and Ca; N is a cation of at least one element selected from the group consisting of Fe, Cu, and Al; and the following relations are satisfied :6<a x and z></a>
 <br>
When the composite oxide represented by the aforementioned formula (Aa-w-xMwM'x)(Si6-yNy)027-z and having an apatite structure has a stoichiometric composition, a is 10, whereas when the composite oxide has a non-stoichiometric composition, a is smaller than 10. In a practically and readily available composite oxide represented by the aforementioned formula and having a non-stoichiometric composition, a satisfies the following relation: 6 
The exhaust gas purifying catalyst of the present invention employs a composite oxide in which, the following relations are satisfied: preferably 0.1 
The exhaust gas purifying catalyst of the present invention exhibits sufficiently high catalytic activity even at a relatively low temperature immediately after starting of an engine of, for example, an automobile, attains excellent exhaust gas purification performance in a low temperature range, and exhibits excellent heat resistance in a high temperature range. Thus, the exhaust gas purifying catalyst attains consistent exhaust gas purification performance over a low to high temperature range. Therefore, the exhaust gas purifying catalyst is suitably employed for purification of exhaust gas discharged from an internal combustion engine of, for example, an automobile.<br>
The noble metal component of the exhaust gas purifying catalyst of the present invention is preferably, for example, rhodium, palladium, or platinum, more preferably platinum or palladium.<br>
The noble metal component of the exhaust gas purifying catalyst of the present<br><br>
invention may form a solid solution with the composite oxide forming the catalyst, or may be supported on the composite oxide. Incorporation of the noble metal component into the composite oxide may be carried out through, for example, a process wherein the composite oxide in the form of powder or slurry is immersed in or mixed with a solution containing the noble metal (basic or acidic noble metal salt solution) to thereby adsorb the noble metal component onto the composite oxide, and the resultant product is fired; a process wherein the noble metal component is mixed with a slurry of the composite oxide during production of the composite oxide, and the resultant mixture is fired; or a process wherein a carrier (e.g., an oxide) on which the noble metal component has been supported is mixed with the composite oxide, and the resultant mixture is subjected to firing or a similar treatment.<br>
The exhaust gas purifying catalyst product of the present invention may be in the form of an exhaust gas purifying catalyst containing the aforementioned composite oxide and noble metal component. However, generally, the exhaust gas purifying catalyst product is formed of a carrier made of a ceramic or metallic material, and a layer of the exhaust gas purifying catalyst supported on the carrier.<br>
In the aforementioned exhaust gas purifying catalyst product, no particular limitation is imposed on the form of the carrier made of a ceramic or metallic material. However, the carrier is generally in the form of, for example, honeycomb, plate, or pellet, and is preferably in a honeycomb form. Examples of the material of the carrier include ceramic materials such as alumina (AI2O3), mullite (3Al2O3-2SiO2), and cordierite (2MgO-2Al2O3-5SiO2); and metallic materials such as stainless steel.<br>
The exhaust gas purifying catalyst product including such a carrier and a layer of the exhaust gas purifying catalyst supported thereon may be produced through, for example, a process wherein a slurry of the composite oxide with which the noble metal component forms a solid solution or on which the noble metal component is supported is applied to a carrier to thereby form a precursor layer of the exhaust gas<br><br>
purifying catalyst, and the precursor layer is fired; a process wherein a slurry of the composite oxide is applied to a carrier to thereby form a layer of the composite oxide, and the carrier having the composite oxide layer is immersed in a solution containing the noble metal component to thereby adsorb the noble metal component onto the composite oxide layer, followed by firing of the resultant product; or a process wherein an oxide on which the noble metal component has been supported is mixed with the aforementioned composite oxide to thereby prepare a slurry, and the slurry is applied to a carrier to thereby form a precursor layer of the exhaust gas purifying catalyst, followed by firing of the precursor layer.<br>

The transparent solution was added dropwise to a solution mixture of aqueous ammonia and ammonium carbonate, to thereby produce a precipitate. The precipitate was aged at 40°C for 24 hours and then washed with water, followed by filtration, and drying at 100°C, to thereby produce a precursor. The precursor was fired at 900°C for six hours, to thereby produce Pr6.33Ba2NdSi6O25.00 of interest.<br><br>
Subsequently, the thus-produced Pr6.33Ba2NdSi6O25.00 was impregnated with dinitrodiammine platinum so that the amount of Pt was 1 mass% with respect to the Pr6.33Ba2NdSi6O25.00, followed by evaporation to dryness.

As is clear from data shown in Table 10, the exhaust gas purifying catalyst product of the present invention employing apatite exhibits strong ability to oxidize HC, and particularly, the exhaust gas purifying catalyst product of Example 26 exhibits high<br><br>
low-temperature activity and excellent heat resistance, and attains consistent exhaust gas purification performance.<br><degree of noble metal dispersion><br>
For each of the exhaust gas purifying catalysts of Examples 1 and 2 and Comparative Examples 1 and 2, the degree of noble metal dispersion was measured according to the CO pulse adsorption method (i.e., known technique) (T. Takeguchi, S. Manabe, R. Kikuchi, K. Eguchi, T. Kanazawa, S. Matsumoto, Applied Catalysis A: 293 (2005) 91.). The degree of noble metal dispersion is calculated by use of the following formula:<br>
degree of noble metal dispersion = the amount (by mole) of platinum corresponding to the amount of CO adsorbed / the total amount (by mole) of platinum contained in the catalyst of interest.<br>
The results of measurement are shown in Table 11.<br>
[Table 11]<br>

The degree of noble metal dispersion indirectly represents the degree of probability of contact between the noble metal and exhaust gas. The higher the degree of noble metal dispersion, the higher the contact efficiency between the noble metal and exhaust gas. As is clear from data shown in Table 11, the degree of Pt dispersion in each of the catalysts of Examples 1 and 2 and Comparative Example 2 is lower than that in the catalyst of Comparative Example 1.<br><br><observation of the state adsorbed c3h6><br>
Each of the exhaust gas purifying catalysts of Example 1 and Comparative Examples 1 and 2 was subjected to IR spectrometry by means of FT-720 (product of Horiba, Ltd.). Firstly, while He was caused to flow through a sample chamber of the apparatus charged with a sample at a flow rate of 175 mL/min, the temperature in the chamber was elevated to 400°C. Subsequently, He was replaced with H2, and the sample chamber was maintained at this temperature for 10 minutes. Thereafter, H2 was replaced with He, and the temperature was lowered to 50oC, to thereby remove substances adsorbed on the sample (i.e., pretreatment of the sample). Subsequently, the sample was heated to 300°C or 400°C in an He atmosphere for background measurement. Then, He was replaced with a gas mixture of 1% C3H6 and 99% He, and 1 minute, 5 minutes, 10 minutes, and 15 minutes thereafter, the state of C3H6 adsorbed on the surface of the sample was observed.<br>
Fig. 1 shows the state of C3H6 adsorbed on the exhaust gas purifying catalyst of Example 1 in the case of heating to 300°C; Fig. 2 shows the state of C3H6 adsorbed on the exhaust gas purifying catalyst of Comparative Example 1 in the case of heating to 300°C; and Fig. 3 shows the state of C3H6 adsorbed on the exhaust gas purifying catalyst of Comparative Example 2 in the case of heating to 300°C.<br>

As is clear from Figs. 1 to 3, in the case of heating to 300°C, each of the exhaust gas purifying catalysts of Example 1 and Comparative Example 1 exhibits a spectral<br><br>
peak attributed to CO (PtO-CO) adsorbed on Pt in the vicinity of 2,000 cm"1, but the exhaust gas purifying catalyst of Comparative Example 2 does not exhibit a spectral peak in the vicinity of 2,000 cm-1. The exhaust gas purifying catalyst of Example 1 exhibits a spectral peak attributed to gas-phase CO which is considered to be released from the sample, and the exhaust gas purifying catalyst of Comparative Example 1 exhibits a spectral peak attributed to gas-phase CO2. In the case of the exhaust gas purifying catalyst of Example 1, the intensity of spectral peaks attributed to Pt°-CO and gas-phase CO increases over time. In contrast, in the case of the exhaust gas purifying catalyst of Comparative Example 1, there is a tendency that the intensity of a spectral peak attributed to Pt°-CO decreases over time, but the intensity of a spectral peak attributed to gas-phase CO2 increases over time.<br>
As is clear from Figs. 4 to 6, in the case of heating to 400°C, each of the exhaust gas purifying catalysts of Example 1 and Comparative Example 1 exhibits spectral peaks similar to those observed in the case of heating to 300°C, and shows a tendency of change over time in spectral peak intensity similar to that in the case of heating to 300°C. The exhaust gas purifying catalyst of Comparative Example 2 exhibits spectral peaks similar to those observed in the exhaust gas purifying catalyst of Example 1, and the intensity of the spectral peaks observed in the catalyst of Comparative Example 2 tends to increase over time.<br>
Oxidation of C3H6 to CO on Pt requires supply of oxygen to Pt. Since oxygen is not present under the aforementioned measurement conditions, observation of a spectral peak attributed to Pt°-CO demonstrates that oxygen is supplied from the carrier to Pt.<br>
Discussion based on the aforementioned data shows that, in each of the exhaust gas purifying catalysts of Example 1 and Comparative Example 2, lattice oxygen of apatite is continued to be supplied to Pt, and the thus-generated CO is released as is (i.e., partial oxidation reaction), whereas in the exhaust gas purifying catalyst of Comparative Example 1, substantially no oxygen is supplied to Pt, and a small<br><br>
amount of CO adsorbed on Pt is oxidized to CO2 (i.e., complete oxidation reaction).<br>
As described above, in the exhaust gas purifying catalyst of the present invention, despite its low degree of noble metal dispersion, interaction occurs between a noble metal and a composite oxide forming the catalyst; i.e., strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) occurs. Occurrence of the interaction promotes partial oxidation reaction of a hydrocarbon, and also promotes reduction reaction of the thus-generated carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides. Therefore, the exhaust gas purifying catalyst of the present invention exhibits, over a low to high temperature range, high effect of purifying exhaust gas discharged from an internal combustion engine.<br><br>
