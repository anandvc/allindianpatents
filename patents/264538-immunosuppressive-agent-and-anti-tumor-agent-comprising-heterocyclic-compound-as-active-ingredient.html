				<td>SPECIFICATION<br>
IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE AGENT AND ANTI-TUMOR AGENT COMPRISING<br>
HETEROCYCLIC COMPOUND AS ACTIVE INGREDIENT<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to novel immunosuppressive agents, and more<br>
specifically immunosuppressive agents comprising heterocyclic compounds of a specific<br>
structure as effective ingredients. The present invention also relates to novel chemical<br>
compounds among the above heterocyclic compounds, and further to the use of such<br>
novel compounds as antitumor agents.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002] In general, as disorders for which immunosuppressive agents may be used,<br>
mention may be made of a number of autoimmune diseases such as rejection after<br>
transplantation of organs or tissues, graft versus host disease after bone-marrow<br>
transplantation, inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn disease,<br>
inflammatory or allergenic skin diseases such as psoriasis or atopic dermatitis,<br>
inflammatory or allergenic respiratory disorders such as chronic obstructive pulmonary<br>
disease or asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma,<br>
Sjogren syndrome, or the like. In addition, immunosuppressive agents such as<br>
cyclophosphamide or methotrexate are employed also in the treatment of hematologic<br>
neoplasms such as multiple myeloma, malignant lymphoma, leukemia or the like.<br>
Furthermore, immunosuppressive agents may also be employed in combination with<br>
antibiotics in the case of the treatment of disorders characterized by an enhanced immune<br>
function associated with infection such as sepsis (Non-Patent Document 1).<br>
Thus, a number of immunosuppressive agents are presently utilized as therapeutic<br>
agents for the above-mentioned disorders in clinical practice. However, as it now stands,<br>
there still remain many problems to be improved due to a failure to obtain a sufficient<br>
therapeutic effect and an unexpected occurrence of side effects.<br>
[0003] A variety of cells such as T, B lymphocytes and factors are known to be involved<br>
in the inducement of the immune response. Since cyclosporin and tacrolimus, which are<br>
presently used for organ transplantation or the like, are restricted in their efficacy to T<br>
cells, there is a need for immunosuppressive agents which serve as agents for acting on<br>
1<br><br>
more extensive immune mechanisms, with less side effects in clinical applications, and<br>
acting simultaneously on a variety of cells involved in the disorders.<br>
Here, "a variety of cells involved in the disorders" are not limited to immune cells, i.e.,<br>
T cells, B cells, monocytes, macrophages, NK cells, NKT cells, dendritic cells, neutrophils,<br>
basophils, eosinophils, mast cells or the like. They should include cells in which functions<br>
are affected by humoral factors released from immune cells or membrane receptors on the<br>
immune cells. Examples of these cells include, but are not limited to platelets, vascular<br>
endothelial cells, synoviocytes, osteoclasts, osteoblasts, chondrocytes, tracheal epithelial<br>
cells, or the like. In addition, in the case where the humoral factors are autoantibodies,<br>
cells expressing target antigens are also included.<br>
[0004] Regarding benzimidazole ring-substituted s-triazine [1,3,5-triazine] derivatives and<br>
pyrimidine derivatives, the present inventors have studied their cytostatic activity on solid<br>
tumors, and have performed synthesis of a great number of such compounds as well as<br>
verification of the relationship between antitumor activity and chemical structure (see<br>
Patent Documents 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5).<br>
[0005] In particular, s-triazine derivatives and pyrimidine derivatives having a specific<br>
substituent at position 2 of the benzimidazole ring were found to exhibit an enhanced<br>
cytostatic activity on solid tumors (see Patent Documents 3, 4 and 5). The processes for<br>
the production of such derivatives are described in these patent documents, but are not<br>
limited to these, and various reactions such as alkylation, alkylcarbonylation or the like<br>
may be induced in the final products to employ the resultant as final compounds.<br>

PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION<br>
[0006] The present inventors demonstrated that the above compounds specifically<br>
inhibited phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activity (Non-Patent Document 2). PI3K is<br>
an enzyme that phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol (PI) on the cell membrane, classified<br>
into three subfamilies according to structures and its substrate specificity. Among these,<br>
2<br><br>
the compounds of the present invention specifically inhibit class I PI3K. Class I PI3K<br>
phosphorylates PI, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate, and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-<br>
biphosphate to produce phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate, phosphatidylinositol 3,4-<br>
biphosphate, and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate, respectively.<br>
Phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate thus produced serves as an intracellular second<br>
messenger. Class I PI3K is expressed in various cells, and exhibits a wide spectrum of<br>
functions such as cell proliferation, cell survival, glucose transport, cytoskeleton<br>
regulation and the like. In PI3K gene-knockout animals, development of B cells, T cells<br>
or the like and signal transduction are obstructed. Furthermore, the degranulation of mast<br>
cells and migration of leukocytes are also obstructed (Non-Patent Document 3).<br>
[0007] It is known that B cell proliferation by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) or anti-IgM<br>
antibodies is inhibited by wortmannin or LY294002, PI3K inhibitors (Non-Patent<br>
Document 4). Furthermore, wortmannin inhibits T cell proliferation induced by anti-CD3<br>
antibodies and anti-CD28 antibodies (Non-Patent Document 5).<br>
[0008] Hematologic neoplasms are characterized by a spontaneous enhancement of cell<br>
division and an inhibition of apoptosis of the immune cells. However, abnormalities of<br>
PI3K cascades such as reduction of PTEN proteins that dephosphorylate<br>
phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate and enhancement of Akt phosphorylation have<br>
been reported (Non-Patent Document 6). Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the<br>
inhibition of PI3K may result in the inhibition of the cell division and the induction of<br>
apoptosis of various hematologic neoplasms (e.g., Non-Patent Document 7).<br>
[0009] Rheumatoid arthritis is a disorder characterized by immune abnormalities and<br>
hypertrophy of synovial tissues. It is known that the hypertrophy of synovial tissues<br>
results from proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis of synoviocytes. In inflamed<br>
synovial tissues of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, the levels of phosphorylated Akt<br>
were increased due to the activation of PI3K (Non-Patent Document 8). Moreover, it was<br>
revealed that proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis of synoviocytes were normalized by<br>
the inhibition of PI3K in vitro study (Non-Patent Document 9).<br>
[0010] However, wortmannin and LY294002 have not been put to clinical use due to their<br>
toxicity. Furthermore, although a lot of candidates that have therapeutic potential for a<br>
wide spectrum of disorders such as inflammations, cancers and others have been<br>
developed to take advantage of PI3K's inhibitory property, none has been put to clinical<br>
use. Thus, there is a need for immunosuppressive agents which normalize the<br>
3<br><br>
hyperfunctioning of PI3K in various cells involved in disorder of immune system without<br>
exhibiting any toxicity to living subjects.<br>

[0071] As will be demonstrated in Examples to be hereinafter described, the agents of the<br>
present invention inhibit the activation of T cells and B cells induced by Con A, LPS, anti-<br>
IgM antibody, anti-CD3 antibody + anti-CD28 antibody, thereby exhibiting PI3K<br>
inhibitory action on the immune cells. Thus, the drugs of the present invention can be<br>
used in the treatment and prevention of disorders of immune system attributable to the<br>
hyperfunctioning of PI3K.<br>
[0072] As disorders of immune system attributable to the hyperfunctioning of PI3K,<br>
mention may be made of: autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic<br>
lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, Sjegren syndrome, or the like; organ dysfunction<br>
associated with autoimmune diseases such as uveitis, glomerulonephritis, thyroiditis,<br>
pancreatitis, bone destruction or the like; rejection after transplantation of tissues, graft<br>
versus host disease after bone-marrow transplantation; inflammatory bowel diseases such<br>
as ulcerative colitis or Crohn disease; inflammatory or allergenic skin diseases such as<br>
psoriasis or atopic dermatitis; inflammatory or allergenic respiratory disorders such as<br>
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma; allergenic conjunctivitis or rhinitis;<br>
hematologic neoplasm originated from immune cells, such as B-cell lymphoma, T-cell<br>
27<br><br>
lymphoma, myeloid leukemia or the like; sepsis triggered by infection with gram-negative<br>
bacteria or coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome, fulminant hepatitis or the like.<br>
[0073] While the agents of the present invention can be applied to mammals such as<br>
humans, dogs, cats, rabbits, hamsters, rats, mice or the like, the administration regimen,<br>
formulation and dosage for application to humans will be particularly explained below.<br>
[0074] The agents of the present invention may be administered orally or parenterally, and<br>
tablets, coated-tablets, powdered drugs, granules, capsules, microcapsules, syrups or the<br>
like may be used as the dosage form for oral administration whereas eye drops, inhalants,<br>
injectable form (including lyophilizates for injection which are to be dissolved upon<br>
application), suppositories, poultices or the like may be used as the dosage form for<br>
parenteral administration. The formulation of these dosage forms may be effected using<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, binders, lubricants, disintegrants, suspending<br>
agents, emulsifiers, preservatives, stabilizing agents and dispersants, such as lactose,<br>
sucrose, starch, dextrin, crystalline cellulose, kaolin, calcium carbonate, talc, magnesium<br>
stearate, distilled water or saline.<br>
[0075] When used in oral dosage forms, the dosages of the effective ingredient will differ<br>
depending on the symptoms, age, weight or the like of the patient, but a daily dose of 10-<br>
500 mg may be administered in 2-3 portions for an adult weighing 60 kg. In addition, the<br>
dosages will also differ depending on the symptoms of the patient in the case of<br>
ophthalmic solutions, inhalation to lungs or the nasal cavity, and injection to inflamed<br>
articular cavities, but a daily dose of 1-100 µg may be administered in 2-3 portions for an<br>
adult.<br>

Next, the assay protocols for pharmacological effects and toxicity of the heterocyclic<br>
compounds represented by the general Formula (I) and their results will be hereinafter<br>
described. Here, the compound number for each test substances corresponds to the<br>
compound number assigned to each of the above heterocyclic compounds.<br>
[00125] Assay Example 1<br>
Mitogen Response Inhibititory Activity<br>
Spleen cells (2 x 106 cells/mL) prepared from C57BL/6N female mice (8 weeks<br>
old, purchased from Charles River Laboratories Japan Inc.) were suspended in RPMI 1640<br>
medium (containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM pyruvic acid, 4.5 g/L<br>
glucose, 100 units/mL penicillin, and 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin), and seeded in wells of a<br>
96 well plate at 0.225 mL per well. Serial dilutions of test substances were added to<br>
respective wells, and then concanavalin A (Con A, 3 µg/mL), lipopolysaccharide (LPS,<br>
100 µg/mL), or an anti-mouse IgM antibody (100 µg/mL) were added. Thereafter, they<br>
41<br><br>
were incubated under conditions of carbon dioxide 5 % at a temperature 37°C for 3 days.<br>
Next, Alamar Blue solution was added at 50 µL per 150 µL, and after having cultured for<br>
one day, the fluorescence intensity at 590 nm using an excitation wavelength of 530 nm<br>
was determined by Cytoflour 4000 (Applied Biosystems). As a result, as shown in Table<br>
1, it was revealed that s-triazine analogs inhibit proliferation of mouse spleen cells induced<br>
by Con A, LPS, or an anti-IgM antibody.<br>

Proliferation Inhibition Assay for Human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells<br>
43<br>
4 mL of blood collected from healthy subjects was placed on 3 mL of MonoPoly<br>
Resolving Medium, and after centrifugation, the mononuclear cell (PBMC) fraction was<br>
collected. After washing with saline, PBMC (1 x 105 cells/mL) was suspended in RPMI<br>
1640 medium (containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM pyruvic acid,<br>
and 4.5 g/L glucose). Next, after having added an anti-CD28 antibody (1 µg/mL) to the<br>
suspension, they were seeded on an anti-human CD3 T cell activation plate (BD<br>
Bioscience) at a capacity of 0.135 mL per well. Then, serial dilutions of test substances<br>
were added to respective wells, and incubated under conditions of carbon dioxide 5 % at a<br>
temperature 37°C. After 3 days, Alamar Blue solution was added at 50 µL per well, and<br>
after incubation for one day, a fluorescence intensity at 590 nm using an excitation<br>
wavelength of 530 nm was determined by Cytoflour 4000 (Applied Biosystems). As a<br>
result, as shown in Table 2, it was revealed that s-triazine analogs inhibit the growth of<br>
human T cells induced by an anti-CD3 antibody and an anti-CD28 antibody.<br>
[00128] [Table 2]<br><br><br><br>
[00129] Assay Example 3<br>
Activation Inhibition Assay for Human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells<br>
In accordance with the method of Assay Example 2, PBMC (2 x 106 cells/mL) was<br>
isolated from human peripheral blood, suspended in RPMI 1640 medium (containing 10%<br>
fetal bovine serum, 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM pyruvic acid, and 4.5 g/L glucose), and seeded<br>
in wells of a 96 well plate at 0.225 mL per well. The test substances were added to<br>
respective wells, and then an anti-CD3 antibody (2 µg/mL) and an anti-CD28 antibody (1<br>
µg/mL) were added. Then, after incubation under conditions of carbon dioxide 5% at a<br>
temperature 37°C for 6 hours, the expressions of CD40L and CD69, activation markers,<br>
were analysed by flow cytometry. As a result, when the cells were stimulated by both an<br>
anti-CD3 antibody and an anti-CD28 antibody, CD40L was expressed on 14.4% of PBMC,<br>
which was also CD4 positive. However, the proportion of the cells which expressed<br>
CD40L decreased when the cells had been treated with test substances (ZSTK474: 4.9%;<br>
913: 3.7%, 1213: 3.6%). Although CD69 was expressed on 28.8% (CD4-positive) and<br>
50.9% (CD4-negative) of PBMC, the proportions of CD4-positive cells (ZSTK 474:<br>
18.8%, 913: 10.1%, 1213:17.7%) and CD4-negative cells (ZSTK 474: 17.7%, 913: 10.5%,<br>
1213: 22.4%) which expressed CD69 decreased when the cells had been treated with test<br>
substances. Thus, the s-triazine analogs were shown to inhibit the activation of<br>
lymphocytes (Figure 1).<br>

Adjuvant-Induced Arthritis Inhibitory Action<br>
Lyophilized Mycobacterium butyricum suspended in Freund's incomplete adjuvant<br>
was intradermally administered to the base of the tail of Lewis male rats (7 weeks old,<br>
purchased from Charles River Laboratories Japan Inc.) to induce adjuvant-induced<br>
arthritis. Then, 10 days after the induction of the adjuvant-induced arthritis, the test<br>
substances suspended in 0.5% hydroxypropylcellulose (HPC) were orally administered on<br>
consecutive days. Furthermore, after the onset of the arthritis, the volume of the hind paw<br>
was measured using a hindpaw edema volume measuring apparatus (TK105, Physio-Tech).<br>
As a result, for the test substances, as shown in Figure 2, a statistically significant<br>

(analysis of variance, Dunnett's test P
after day 14 was confirmed for the present model study.<br>
[00131] Assay Example 5<br>
Collagen-Induced Arthritis Inhibitory Action<br>
Bovine type II collagen suspended in Freund's complete adjuvant was intradermally<br>
administered to the base of tail of DBA1 male mice (7 weeks old, purchased from Charles<br>
River Laboratories Japan Inc.) on day 1 and day 21. Then, from day 28 when 50% of the<br>
mice developed arthritis, the test substances suspended in 0.5% hydroxypropylcellulose<br>
(HPC) were orally administered on consecutive days. Here, the efficacy was evaluated by<br>
scoring the arthritis. Specifically, for each paw, the degree of arthritis was evaluated<br>
according to: no symptoms: 0; redness or swelling of one joint: 1; redness or swelling for<br>
two or more joints: 2; redness or swelling over the entire paw: 3; and maximum redness or<br>
swelling over the entire paw: 4. As a result, it was revealed that ZSTK474 inhibited the<br>
progression of the collagen-induced arthritis in a dose-dependent manner. For the group<br>
administered 50 or 100 mg/kg of the above compound, after day 30, a statistically<br>
significant efficacy was recognized (Dunnett's test P
administered 50 mg/kg of the above compound, the conditions were exacerbated after day<br>
40, and no significant difference was recognized in comparison with the control group<br>
after day 44 (Figure 3).<br>

Rabbit synoviocytes HIG-82 suspended in HAM medium (containing 10% fetal<br>
bovine serum, 25 mM HEPES, and 0.1 mg/mL kanamycin) (with 4 x 104 cells/mL) were<br>
seeded in wells of a 96 well plate at 0.135 mL per well. Then, 15 p.L of each of serial<br>
dilutions of test substances was added to a respective well, and incubated under conditions<br>
of carbon dioxide 5 % at a temperature 37°C. Alamar Blue solution was added at 50 µL<br>
per well on day 0 and day 3, and incubated for one day, and thereafter fluorescence<br>
intensity at 590 nm using an excitation wavelength of 530 nm was determined by<br>
Cytoflour 4000 (Applied Biosystems). As shown in Table 3, it was demonstrated that s-<br>
triazine analogs inhibited cell division of rabbit synoviocytes.<br>

Charles River Laboratories Japan Inc.) and peripheral lymph node mononuclear cells<br>
prepared from BALB/c female mice (8-10 weeks old, purchased from Charles River<br>
Laboratories Japan Inc.) were used as stimulator cells and responder cells, respectively.<br>
The respective cells were suspended in RPMI 1640 medium (containing 10% fetal bovine<br>
serum, 100 units/mL penicillin, and 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin) (with 2 x 106 cells/mL).<br>
Then, the stimulator cells (50 uL) treated with mitomycin C (50 mg/mL, 30 minutes) were<br>
added to the responder cells (100 uL). Thereafter, serial dilutions of test substances were<br>
added to respective wells, and incubated under conditions of carbon dioxide 5% at 37°C<br>
for 86 hours. Finally, the cell proliferation was examined using a BrdU cell proliferation<br>
kit (Calbiochem). As a result, as shown in Table 4, it was found that the s-triazine analogs<br>
inhibited the allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reaction.<br>

Escherichia coli WP2uvrA, the test substances (Compound 8, Compound 10, Compound<br>
12 and Compound 14) were tested for their mutagenesis according to a preincubation<br>
method. As a result, with or without metabolic activation due to S-9, even in 5000 µg/flat<br>
plate (maxium dose), no increase was observed in the colony number of reverse mutation<br>
in any tested strains, so mutagenesis was negative. Accordingly, in addition to in vivo<br>
tests such as rat adjuvant induced arthritis assay, mouse collagen induced arthritis assay,<br>
human B-lymphoma xenografted model, fulminant hepatitis inhibition assay and<br>
toxicologic test for single oral administration, s-triazine analogs were found to be safer<br>

Test for Measuring Blood Level<br>
A pharmacokinetic study was performed using 6 week-old BDF1 male mice. The test<br>
substances were mixed with hydroxylpropylcellulose (low-molecular weight form)<br>
[HPC(L)] in 2.5-fold of the drug weight, and dissolved in dichloromethane. The<br>
solventwas evaporated to dryness. To make the dosing formation, the residue was<br>
suspended in distilled water to prepare the drug level of 20 mg/mL. The test compounds<br>
were administered compulsorily and orally at a dose of 200 mg/kg to the mice that had<br>
been starved for 16 hours. One hour after the administration, blood was collected from the<br>
orbits of two mice to obtain serum. Internal standards solution and 1 ml of distilled water<br>
were added to 100 µL of serum thus obtained, and then extracted with diethylether. The<br>
solvent was evaporated under vacuum, and the residue was resolved with eluent to provide<br>
samples for the HPLC measurement. HPLC was performed by using reversed-phase type<br>
column, and acetonitrile-phosphate buffer (pH 2.5) was used as the eluent. Using<br>
regression curves (Y=aX+b) obtained from the standards, the drug levels in the sample<br>
serum were calculated. Their results are shown in Table 7 below.<br>

[00145] [Table 7]<br><br><br>
As shown in the above test results, the compounds of the present invention having an<br>
acyl group at position 4 of the piperazine ring exhibited high blood levels quickly, one<br>
hour after the administration, as compared with the known control compounds 2, 3 and 9.<br>
[00146] Assay Example 14<br>
Proliferation Inhibitory Activity on Solid Tumor Cells<br>
Used in the test were MCF-7 cells which were established from human breast<br>
cancer and were cultured routinely under the conditions of 37°C and 5% CO2, in MEM<br>
medium supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum, 25 mM of HEPES and 0.1 mg/ml<br>
kanamycin. The MCF-7 cells in a logarithmic growth phase were treated with<br>
trypsin/EDTA to prepare single cell suspension adjusted to 4.0 x 104 cells/ml in MEM<br>
medium (supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum, 25 mM of HEPES and 0.1 mg/ml<br>
kanamycin). Test compounds were dissolved in DMSO and diluted with RPMI 1640<br>
medium (supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum, 25 mM of HEPES and 0.1 mg/ml<br>
kanamycin) to a concentration of 2.0 x 10-4 to 2.0 x 10-9M.<br>
The cell suspension was filled in a 96-wells microplate at a rate of 0.1 ml per well<br>
and was cultured for 24 hours so as to make the cells to adhere to the microplate. Then, it<br>
was added with 0.1 ml of the sample solution and cultured at 37°C for 72 hours in 5% CO2.<br>
50 % Growth inhibition concentrations (GI50 µM) were calculated from growth<br>
inhibitions at various sample concentrations. The results are as shown in Table 8.<br>
In the foregoing, when the cells other than MCF-7 are used, instead of adding 10 %<br>
fetal bovine serum, the following media were used, and the following single cell<br>
suspensions were prepared.<br>
PC-3 prostate cancer cells: 10% fetal bovine serum in F12K medium, single cell<br>
suspension of 2 x 104 cells;<br>
A549 lung cancer cells: 10% fetal bovine serum in DMEM medium, single cell suspension<br>
