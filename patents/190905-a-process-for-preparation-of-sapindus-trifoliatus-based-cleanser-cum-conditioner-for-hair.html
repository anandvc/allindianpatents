This invention relates to a process for preparation of Spends Trifoliate based hair cleanser cum conditioner. Hair cleansers cum conditioners of natural origin i,e, herbal origin are generally preferred to the synthetic ones because of their law toxicity to human beings; less harm to the body; and least side reactions and allergies to human beings in comparison to chemical cleansing agents,<br>
The Invention in general relates to Sapindus Trifoliate Extract generally known as Reeta Extract with long shelf and storage period and improved cleansing and conditioning efficacious. Sapindus Trifoliate is l<known to possess hair cleansing and exhibits growth enhancement dandruff inhibition anti-lice other advantageous properties as a agent></known>
PRIOR ART<br>
Direct application of Sapindus Trifoliate wet paste on the hair is likely to result in the deposition of high concentration on certain areas,<br><br>
rough handling and difficulty to perform the cleansing job and the washing off  the paste from the head. The act is more tearful to the hair due to rough handling and simultaneously being difficult to collect fresh Spends Trifoliate each time just prior to the use. Therefore from the availability and safety point of view, fresh Sap Indus Trifbiiatus has to be collected, soaked over-night, tiioroughly and smoothly ground and mixed with water just prior to every use. But such aqueous paste is not known to have been used on a commercial scale as a cleanser due to factors  such as unstable nature of the aqueous mixture over long periods of time. The paste develops malodor, discoloration due to biodegradation because of the presence of microbial and en2ymes.<br>
of extensive research and experiments it has been concluded and arrived at a Sapindus Trifbiiatus based hair cleanser which is storage stable, water scrubbed, safe and rich in cleansing ark corxlitioner principles.<br>
The prior art does not refer to stable Sapindus Trifoliate extract from natural resources containing the cleansing feature arxi conditioning feature to the hair-care product<br><br>
In so far as said preferences are absent; In the prior art, both the product of this invention, a series of Spends Trifoliate based extract and the hereinafter described process for the same are novel.<br>
It Is the object of the present Invention to full the lacunae existing in the prior art<br>
It is another object of the invention to arrive at an end product, whose quality Is better than the ones existing currently and is readily available off the shelf with a long shelf period.<br>
It is another object of the present invention towards making heri&gt;ai and natural hair-care product In the context of present trends towards herbal cleansing agents, the importance of a product containing only natural resources cannot be overstressed. It is also significant to note that all the raw materials for Sapindus Trifbliatus based cleanser cum conditioner is renewable resource<br>
Accordingly another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of Saplndus Trifbliatus based conditioner which is storage stable, water soluble, safe and rich In hair cleansing and conditioner principles.<br><br>
It Is another object of the Invention to enhance cleansing efficacy by their use in formulated products.<br>
It is another object of the invention to entrance conditioning effect imparted by their use in formulated inflicts. These and other objects of the invention will be apparent from ensuing description.<br>
MAIN ADYANTAGES OF THE INVENTION<br>
Systematic Process for Extraction with higher extraction levee and more efficiently.<br>

The invention is further illustrated by ttie preferred ennbodiment wNch Is now described in detail herein below. However, the scope of the invention Is not limited by said preferred embodiment<br>
SILECTIQW : Sapindus Trifoliatus fruits of a particular stage of ripeness which vary from green to dark brown color are collected and de-pulped in crcshers. The preferred appearance of the fruit is Pale Brown to Dark Brown cok}r with sNny pods. The preferred average weight of each pod is 4.0 to 5.10 gms. The preferr<id avei age weight of the flesh is total fruit preferred average seed></id>
The pulp is separated and cut into pieces of uniform size between 5-10 mm size.<br><br>
CRUSHING : The pulp is then soaked in water in the ratio of one part by weight of pulp to 6 parts of water for 3-5 hours. The soaked wet pulp is then transferred into  a round bottom flask for crushing the pulp into paste.<br>
REPLUXING : The flask has two hoted lid. Through the first hole, a pn^peiter surrer Is fixed and through the second hole, a reflux condenser is fixed. The pulp is agitated for 15 - 20 minutes in the flask by stirrer at 60 rpm at a temperature of 9095  C. The pulp is allowed to simmer. The temperotune is maintained between 90-95P C for 1/4 hour under constant agitation and relexing. Slowly the pulp is disintegrated and forms a thick paste.<br>
FILTERATION: This process is selected so as to provide the most economical and desired quality of the paste by the method of stirring and refluxing. The hot paste is then transferred for filtration through an non-woven nylon cloth (quality 1969).<br>
PBESERVATIVES : To prevent the deterioration of the smooth pasty filtrate, preservatives are then added. It Is again then stirred. The agitation and stirring Is done at room temperature.<br><br>
SEALING:The Sapindus Trifollatus paste with the preservative Is sent being Immediately for sealing In airtight containers.<br>
The storage In the airtight cxantalnens Is only for 20-24 hours before being sent for formulation.<br>
