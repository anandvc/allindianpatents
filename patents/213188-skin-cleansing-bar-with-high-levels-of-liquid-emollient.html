The following specification (particularly) describes the nature of this invention (and the manner in which it is to be performed)<br><br><br>
WO 02/50226<br><br>
PCT/EP01/14761<br><br>
SKIN CLEANSING BAR WITH HIGH LEVELS OF LIQUID EMOLLIENT<br>
This invention relates generally to cleansing bars, and more particularly to cleansing bars having high levels of 5  emollient.<br>
Synthetic detergent or syndet toilet bars have found considerable use as mild cleansing bars but such bars have the potential to be soft and typically require structuring<br>
10  agents to be added to firm or harden the bar.  Thus the main function of prior art structurants such as sodium stearate in syndet bars is to provide body and give structure to the product.  For example, sodium stearate finds considerable use as a structurant or structuring agent in syndet bar<br>
15  formulations, forming a fibrous network structure which<br>
helps in improving- the mush and rate of wear properties of the bars.  However, there is a problem in structuring syndet bars containing high levels of emollients that are liquid at room temperature (25 C).<br>
20<br>
12-Hydroxystearic acid has been previously employed as a strucuturing agent in high water content soap or syndet bars; see e.g. US Patent No. 5,225,097 issued to M. Kacher, et al. on July 6, 1993 and U.S. Patent No. 5,227,086 issued<br>
25  to M. Kacher, et al. on July 13, 1993; which are herein incorporated by reference.  However the bars described by Kacher did not contain high levels of hydrophobic or hydrophilic emollients which have melting points below 25 C. JP Kokai publication no. 7034100A, issued to E. Yoshiyuki,<br>
30  et al. on Feb. 3, 1995 describes a syndet bar containing 1 to 30% by weight of a liquid or semi-solid oil and 0.01 to 5<br><br>
WO 02/50226<br><br>
PCT/EPO1/14761<br><br>
 % by weight of 12-hydroxystearic acid.  However, the physical properties of the bars described by Yoshiyuki are not commercially acceptable, especially regarding the bar's wear rate and mush properties. 5<br>
Unexpectedly the use of 12-hydroxystearic acid in syndet formulations at levels in excess  of 5% by weight and with high levels of emollients that are liquid at room temperature (i.e. have a melting point below 25 C) has been 10  found to substantially improve the rate of wear and mush propensity of syndet toilet bars.  High rates of wear and mush propensity are negative attributes of prior art syndet formulations as discussed above.<br>
15     Furthermore it was unexpectedly discovered that the use of 12-hydroxy stearic acid in a low viscosity melt (Brookfield viscosity range of about 10 cps to about 40,000 cps) with high amounts of emollients which are liquid at room temperature gave a relatively stable melt, with no<br>
20  observable phase separation, between 70°C and 110°C with continuous mixing.  In comparison, the same quantity of stearic acid as the sole structuring agent yields a very unstable syndet bar system where the hydrophobic emollient phase noticeably separates from the mix in the absence of<br>
25  phase stabilizers such as lauryl alcohol, or alternatively produces an undesirably soft bar in the absence of phase separation.  It was also unexpectedly found that the use of 12-hydroxystearic acid in syndet formulations will improve the rate of wear and mush propensity of the formulations.<br>

Other suitable surfactants which may be used are described 5  in U.S. Patent No. 3,723,325 to Parran Jr. titled "Detergent Compositions Containing Particle Deposition Enhancing Agents" issued March, 27, 1973; and "Surface Active Agents and Detergents".

The inventive toilet bar also contains 5 to 30% by wt., 15  preferably 10 to 15% by wt. of total structurant including 12-hydroxystearic acid. Preferably the only structurant in the toilet bar is 12-hydroxystearic acid and is present at 10 to 15 % by wt., preferably at 11 to 15 % by wt., and most preferably at 13 to 15 % by wt.  Structurants are used to 20  enhance the bar integrity, improve the processing properties, and enhance desired user sensory profiles.

 Conventional art recognised melt cast processing techniques may be used to fabricate the inventive toilet bar. For example, the melted components of the inventive bar are usually blended together at elevated temperatures. 5  Optionally the water level may be adjusted and the blending will continue.  Next an optional drying step may follow whereby the water is reduced.  Preferably the water level of the ingredients is selected to be low enough to avoid the drying process.  Finally, the molten cleansing composition is<br>
10  poured into molds and cooled to its hardening point.  The molds may be made of any rigid material that is not subject to attack by the ingredients of the toilet bar.  Mold materials may include plastic, metal, glass, ceramic, composite, or elastomeric materials and the like.  Cooling<br>
15  the molten cleansing materials can be accomplished by art recognised cooling techniques including refrigeration, cryogenics, ambient air and the like.  Controlled cooling using thermostatic control cooling devices may also be employed.<br>

 Example 1:<br>
Syndet toilet bars with and without lauryl alcohol as a phase stabilizer were melt cast from the formulations listed in table 1.  Bars A and B are comparative using stearic acid 5  as the structuring agent.  Bars C and D represent embodiments of the present invention using 12-hydroxystearic acid as the structuring agent.  The bars .were compared for melt phase stability, hardness, and mush using the test methods described below. Comparative bar A did not yield a<br>
10  homogeneous bar due to phase separation.  Comparative bar B containing lauryl alcohol as a phase stabilizer yielded a homogeneous bar but was considerably softer than inventive bar D which contained the same amount of lauryl alcohol. Concentrations are given in parts.<br>

 Description of Test Methods:<br>
Evaluation of Mush:<br>
Immerse a weighed toilet bar in 250 ml water (at 25 C), in a beaker for four hours.  Scrape the mush from the bar with a soft plastic knife.  Weigh the scraped bar after allowing to dry at room temperature 24 hours.  The weight change multiplied by 100 and divided by the initial weight of the bar denotes the mush of the bar.  Mush is calculated as the average of three bars.<br>
Rate of Wear:<br>
Wet a pre-weighed bar in running water and rotate 15 times while in the tester's hand.  Place on a support stand. Repeat 10 times at half hour intervals.  Weigh the washed bar after allowing to dry at room temperature for 16 hours. The weight change multiplied by 100 and divided by the initial weight of the bar denotes the rate of wear of the bar.<br>
Foam  (lather) Measurement:<br>
A tester rotates a wet bar ten times between his hands.  Then 5 mis of 95 C water is added and the bar is rubbed with the hands to generate lather.  Then the tester dips his hands in a water tank under an inverted funnel coupled to a measuring cylinder so as to collect and measure the volume in mis of the generated lather.<br><br>
WO 02/50226<br><br>
PCT/EPO1/14761<br><br>
 3ar Hardness Measurement:<br>
The method used for the hardness measurement is sectilometry or cutting the soap with a suitable wire as described e.g. 5  by Bowen and Thomas in Trans. Farad. Soc. 31, 164, (1935).<br>
Example 4<br>
