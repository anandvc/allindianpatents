TITLE: A METHOD TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF ELECTRO-MAGNETIC<br>
STIRRING ON CONTINUOUSLY CAST STEEL BILLETS BY ULTRASONIC<br>
IMMERSION C-SCAN IMAGING.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to ultrasonic immersion c-scan imaging technique to<br>
evaluate the effect of electromagnetic stirring on continuously cast steel billets<br>
for soundness by optimization of various parameters i.e. current, frequency,<br>
position etc.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Usually evaluation of the effect of electro-magnetic stirring on soundness of<br>
continuously cast steel billets and slabs are assessed by the following methods:<br>
1.	Visual inspection of macro-etch<br>
2.	Sulphur print evaluation<br>
But ultrasonic assessment provides through thickness information of the test<br>
samples, whereas, macro-etching and sulphur print methods provide information<br>
in one plane only. For more realistic assessment these methods requires large<br>
number of test samples and hot acids which is hazardous and pollute the<br>
atmosphere also. Ultrasonic method is pollution free and eco-friendly method<br>
and may require less number of samples also.<br>
To overcome the problems faced during the evaluation of cleanliness level of<br>
steel, by above mentioned methods, a lot of interest has been shown to detect,<br><br>
3<br>
measure and analyze macro-level inclusions in steel using specialized ultrasonic<br>
techniques. It is preferred ultrasonic method in comparison to other methods as<br>
inspection could be done with a larger sample volume.<br>
While evaluating the macro-inclusion distribution and detection, in comparison to<br>
other methods, ultrasonic method was found to be more effective. Attenuation<br>
measurements were found to give very low numerical values. With this<br>
background, a high gain pulse echo ultrasonic technique was used for inclusion<br>
detection in forgings in a quantitative manner.<br>
Macro-etching and sulphur print methods provide information in one plane only.<br>
For more realistic assessment these methods requires large number of test<br>
samples and hot acids which is hazardous and pollute the atmosphere also.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
•	The object of the invention is to evaluate the effect of electro-magnetic<br>
stirring on soundness of high and low carbon continuously cast steel<br>
billets.<br>
•	Another object of the invention is to reduce the use of hazardous hot<br>
acids/chemicals for control of environment and industrial pollution.<br>
•	Other object of the invention is to reduce the running cost of repetitive<br>
tests for quality check.<br><br>
4<br>
• Also the object of the invention is to make the process accessible to the<br>
demanding industries and reduce human error.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Stirring intensity decreases with increasing frequency and it is related to the<br>
"skin effect" according to which eddy currents are more concentrated on the<br>
outer part of the conductor as the frequency increases.<br>
The following relationship describe the effect of EMS frequency on stirring<br>
intensity, F<br>
Fa B2M(f)f<br>
Where, BM = magnetic induction in the considered point inside the metal (in<br>
Gauss)<br>
f = Frequency of power supply, in Hz.<br>
The above formula shows that the stirring force is the product of B2M (f) (which<br>
decreases with increasing frequency) and f. At frequency zero the force is zero<br>
and at higher frequency the force approaches to zero again because the term<br>
B2M (f) becomes very small. In between, there is a specific frequency, the so-<br>
called optimum frequency, at which the stirring force is maximum.<br>
The current of EMS coil controls its performance, because the stirring force (F),<br>
acting on the liquid steel is proportional to the square of the magnetic flux (BM,<br><br>
7<br>
which is proportional to the current). Consequently, the current setting is the<br>
main operational parameter, which is to be chosen as function of the casting<br>
conditions. Generally, the current is kept constant during casting.<br>
Theoretically, the current setting depends on the chemical composition of each<br>
steel grade. An optimization is to be done for each individual case. Increased<br>
casting speed as well as increased superheat needs increased current settings. In<br>
practice however, the justification of different current setting as function of<br>
casting speed and superheat shall have to be ascertained for each specific case.<br>
During any metallurgical improvement obtained by EMS (such as reduction of<br>
surface and subsurface defects, increase of equiaxed zone, decrease of axial<br>
porosity or segregation etc.), too low current settings give insufficient<br>
improvements, too high current settings give practically no further improvements<br>
and spend electrical power for nothing. Moreover, too high current settings may<br>
give rise to negative effects. Consequently, the optimum current setting is the<br>
compromise of good results and reasonable power consumption. It needs many<br>
casts and analysis under reproducible conditions with and without stirring, to<br>
establish quantitatively the exact relation between improvement and current<br>
setting.<br>
The attempts have been made to determine the best combination of EMS current<br>
and frequency for ensuring good surface as well as subsurface quality of CC steel<br>
billets cast at Billets Casters. Two close casting grades, one of high carbon grade<br>
(HC Grade-A) and another of low carbon grade (LC Grade-A) of steel billet was<br>
considered. The chemical compositions of the above mentioned grades have<br>
been shown in Table 1 and Table 2 respectively. The experiments were<br><br>
8<br>
conducted on the above grades of CC billets with EMS currents 240, 260, 280<br>
and 300 amperes (A), while frequency was kept constant to 3.5 Hz during<br>
casting. In some of the heats EMS frequencies were set at 3, 3, 5 and 4 hertz<br>
(Hz) while EMS current was kept constant during casting. In both the cases, the<br>
corresponding CC billet samples were collected and its effect on billet quality was<br>
assessed by using ultrasonic immersion C-Scan imaging technique.<br>
Each billet sample of cross section of 130 x 130 mm was sliced into transverse<br>
and longitudinal sections (approximately 20 mm thick) and ground to good<br>
surface finish. Figure-1 shows the schematic diagram of billet samples collected<br>
from Billet Caster.<br>
All the steel billet samples were examined using the ultrasonic immersion C-Scan<br>
imaging technique. All microstructural features observed, in each case, were<br>
recorded and analyzed subsequently. Finally, data of axial porosity,<br>
columnar/equiaxed zone, % defective area (which includes segregation,<br>
inclusions, pinhole, internal as well a subsurface cracks) of the total scanned<br>
area in each grades of steel were compared for determining the best<br>
combination of EMS parameters.<br>
A series of tests -were carried out with the billet specimens to evaluate and<br>
optimize the EMS current and frequency with respect to CC steel billet quality.<br>
These specimens were subsequently tested in a water tank using a 5 MHz<br>
ultrasonic focused beam probe. The C-scan images were obtained with the help<br>
of a computer controlled ultrasonic immersion C-scan system. The other details<br>
of the equipment and testing parameters are given below:<br><br>

Scan Resolution	-0.4mm<br>
Index Resolution	- 0.4 mm<br>
Scan Mode	- Bi-Directional<br>
Calibration	- In order to achieve reproducible result during<br>
ultrasonic evaluation of macro level flaw<br>
counts, the equipment was standardized with<br>
a 0.7 mm Flat Bottom Hole (FBH) in the<br>
same billet sample. 0.7 mm Flat Bottom Hole<br>
(FBH) resulted in 5 V peak. This peak was<br>
indicated by yellow colour, kept as upper<br>
threshold. 1 V peak-to-peak (i.e. 20% of full<br>
screen height) was kept the lower threshold<br>
as indicated by green colour.<br>
This technique was applied to evaluate the quality of steel billet samples.<br>
Ultrasonic C-scan can image different five intermediate layers of the billet<br>
samples and plot in two dimensions of the final image. Therefore, all the internal<br>
defects appeared at the final image, where as in macro-etched structure<br>
revealed only top etched layer of the samples. One major advantage of<br>
ultrasonic C-scan over A-scan is that classification of different kinds of defects is<br>
possible by imaging of the defects by this method. This method also reveals<br>
three different regions in the samples such as chilled zone, equiaxed zone and<br>
columnar zone in different gray/colour scale.<br><br>
11<br>
A series of C-scan tests were carried out with varying parameter settings. The<br>
instrument variables for these tests were as follows:<br>
•	Resolution : 0.4 mm x 0.4 mm<br>
•	Voltage setting	: 20V and<br>
•	Gain	: 33 dB<br>
Grey scale was used to differentiate the results from the gated area. Referring to<br>
ultrasonic C-scan images, and based on a grey scale that depicts attenuated<br>
signals darker, one may see clear identification of defects by the darker areas.<br>
Although not very sharp, each and every one of the areas is reproduced with a<br>
certain degree of dimensional accuracy. However the boundary of each defect is<br>
not well defined.<br>
Prior to this work, the Billet Caster used a setting of 260A EMS current and 3.5<br>
Hz EMS frequency for all the close casting grades. In this work, it has been tried<br>
to find out the optimum combination of EMS current and frequency which will<br>
produce billet with good internal quality consistently.<br>
Initially EMS current was set to 240, 260 280, and 300A during casting and billet<br>
samples were collected and examined to find out the effect of change in current.<br>
Samples without EMS (non-EMS) condition were also collected.<br>
This is aluminium killed steel with carbon content 0.63%. The other details of the<br>
grade have been shown Table 1.<br><br>
12<br>
Figure 2 shows the ultrasonic C-Scan image of transverse section of non-EMS<br>
billet sample of HC Grade-A. It can be easily observed that there is a very small<br>
equiaxed zone with a large columnar zone and a huge defective area in non-EMS<br>
billet samples when compared with the EMS billet samples. After use of EMS,<br>
there was significant improvement in quality of CC billets in terms of larger%<br>
equiaxed zone, small axial porosity and low% defective areas, which is desirable.<br>
It is also evident from the Figures 3-6 which show the ultrasonic C-Scan images<br>
of transverse sections of CC billet sample of HC Grade-A, at EMS current 240,<br>
260, 280 and 300A.<br>
Figure 7 demonstrates the quantitive values of the effect of EMS current on the<br>
quality of HC Grade-A billet samples in terms of % equiaxed zone and the %<br>
defective area of total area. It is clear that the equiaxed zone in non-EMS<br>
samples is only 15% whereas it is 35, 39, 47 and 45% in EMS billet samples at<br>
the EMS current 240, 260, 280 and 300A respectively. Similarly, the defective<br>
area in the non-EMS billet sample is as high a 19% of the total area of the billet<br>
sample, while it is 15, 13, 10 and 10% in EMS billet samples at the EMS current<br>
240, 260, 280 and 300A respectively.<br>
In can be, therefore, concluded that the % of equiaxed zone increase sharply<br>
with the increase in EMS current. It is most significant at EMS current 280A after<br>
that it increases marginally. Similarly, the % total defective area in the billet<br>
sample, with respect to the total area of billet section, also decreases<br>
considerably with increase in EMS current up to 280A after that it does not<br>
decrease further.<br><br>
13<br>
LC Grade-A<br>
This is a cold heading quality grade and its application is for high tensile<br>
fasteners. The details of this grade have been shown in Table 2.<br>
Figure 8 shows the ultrasonic C-Scan image of transverse section of non-EMS<br>
billet sample LC Grade-A. It can be easily observed that there is a very small<br>
equiaxed zone with a large columnar zone and a huge defective area in non-EMS<br>
billet samples when compared with the EMS billet samples. When EMS was used,<br>
there was significant improvement in quality of CC billets in terms of larger %<br>
equiaxed zone, small axial porosity and low % defective areas, which is<br>
desirable. It is also evident from the Figures 9-12 which show the ultrasonic C-<br>
Scan images of transverse sections of billet sample of LC Grade-A at EMS current<br>
240, 260, 280 and 300A.<br>
Figures 7 demonstrates the quantative values of the effect of EMS current on the<br>
quality of LC Grade-A billet samples in term % equiaxed zone and the %<br>
defective area of total area. It is clear that the equiaxed zone in non-EMS sample<br>
is only 12% whereas, in EMS billet samples, it is 33, 37, 39 and 37% at the EMS<br>
current 240, 260, 280 and 300A .respectively. Similarly, the defective area in the<br>
non-EMS billet sample is as high as 22% of the total area of the billet sample,<br>
while, in EMS billet samples, at the EMS current 240, 260, 280 and 300A, it is 19,<br>
17, 13 and 13% respectively.<br>
Hence, it can be concluded that the % equiaxed zone increases sharply with the<br>
increasing EMS current. It is most significant at EMS current 280A after that it<br><br>
14<br>
increases marginally. Similarly, the % total defective area in the billet sample,<br>
with respect to the total are of billet section, also decreases considerably with<br>
increase in EMS current up to 280A and after that it does not decrease further.<br>
Optimization of EMS frequency<br>
After optimization of EMS current, EMS frequency was, then, set to 3, 3, 5<br>
(existing practice) and 4 Hz, keeping EMS current constant at 280 during casting<br>
and billet samples were collected. These billet samples were also ultrasonically<br>
analyzed and evaluated.<br>
Figures 13 and 14 shows the ultrasonic C-Scan image of transverse section of<br>
billet samples of HC Grade-A at EMS current 280 A and EMS frequency 3 Hz and<br>
4 Hz respectively whereas Figures 15 and 16 show the ultrasonic C-Scan image<br>
of transverse section of billet samples of LC Grade-A at EMS current 280A and<br>
EMS frequency 3 and 4 Hz respectively. In both the grades, it was found that<br>
quality of the billet samples appears sounder, in terms of the % equiaxed zone,<br>
axial porosity and the % defective areas, when the EMS frequency was 3.5 Hz,<br>
when compared to the same with the EMS frequency 3 Hz and 4 Hz.<br>
Figure 13 demonstrate the quantitative values of the effect of EMS frequency on<br>
the quality of billet samples of both the grades in term of the % equiaxed zone<br>
and the % defective area of total area.<br>
It is obvious that the equiaxed zone in non-EMS HC Grade-A samples is only<br>
15% whereas, in EMS billet samples, it is 33, 47 and 48% at the EMS frequency<br><br>
15<br>
3, 3.5 and 4 Hz respectively. Similarly, the defective area in the non-EMS billet<br>
sample is as high as 19% of the total area of the billet sample, while, in EMS<br>
billet samples, at the EMS frequency 3, 3.5 and 4 Hz, it is 18, 10 and 11%<br>
respectively. Hence, it can be concluded that, in this case, the % equiaxed zone<br>
increases sharply with the increasing EMS frequency. It is most significant at<br>
EMS frequency 3.5 Hz after that it increases marginally. Similarly, the % total<br>
defective area in the billet sample, with the respect to the total area of billet<br>
section, also decreases considerably with increase in EMS frequency up to 3.5 Hz<br>
and after that it starts increasing.<br>
In case of LC Grade-A, in non-EMS samples it is 12% only whereas, in EMS billet<br>
samples, it is 28, 39 and 37% at the EMS frequency 3, 3.5 and 4 Hz respectively.<br>
Similarly, the defective area in the non-EMS billet sample is as high as 22% of<br>
the total area of the billet sample, while, in EMS billet samples, at the EMS<br>
frequency 3, 3.5 and 4 Hz, it is 21, 13 and 16% respectively. Hence, it can be<br>
concluded that, in this case also, the % equiaxed zone increases with the<br>
increase in EMS frequency. It is most significant at EMS frequency 3.5 Hz and<br>
after that it increases marginally. The % total defective area in the billet sample,<br>
with respect to the total area of billet section, also decreases considerably with<br>
increase in EMS frequency up to 3.5 Hz and after that it starts increasing further.<br>
It was observed that billet samples contain large axial porousity with lot of<br>
subsurface defects also. Therefore EMS frequency should not be increased<br>
further.<br><br>
