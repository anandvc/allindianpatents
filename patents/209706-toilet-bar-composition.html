COMPLETE SPECIFICATION (See Section 10)<br>
1. TITLE OF INVENTION TOILET BAR COMPOSITION<br>
2. HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, of Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai - 400 020, Maharashtra, India, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913.<br>
GRANTED<br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br>
11-5-2004<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The present invention relates to a toilet bar suitable for topical application for cleansing the human body, such as the skin and hair.  In particular, it relates to a toilet bar composition producing a high rate and quantity of lather and that conveys excellent sensory properties.<br>
Toilet bar skin cleaning properties are well known.  An ideal bar composition not only cleans but provides a large quantity of lather and leaves the skin feeling comfortable. To accomplish this, a wide variety of additives have been suggested for inclusion in toilet bars.  Some additives enhance the physical properties of the bar such as hardness and wear rate.  Other additives enhance the in-use properties such as lather volume, creaminess, lather speed, and stability.<br>
Still other additives modify the skin feel both during and after use. Furthermore, consumers often seek a product that meets their specific needs. As a result, a single toilet bar product is not suitable or desirable for every consumer. At the same time, the bar manufacturer desires to reduce costs by minimizing the difference in toilet bar compositions it produces.  To these ends, additives that modify the sensory properties at low concentration levels will provide significant advantages to providing varied products to consumers with products that meet the consumer's specific needs and at low cost.<br><br><br>
In the past, polymer and high molecular weight additives have typically been used at low levels to modify the sensory properties of cleansing compositions such as shampoos, body washes, shower gels, hand washes.  In toilet bars, however, polymer and high molecular weight additives have not been widely used because they frequently have a negative impact on bar feel (e.g. sand and grit), lather speed and lather volume.<br>
Surprisingly, the applicants have discovered that certain polymeric and low molecular weight amido amines and amido ammonium salts can provide excellent bar feel and lather properties, while at the same time providing excellent skin feel when formulated into toilet bars.<br>
US Patent No. 4,820,447; titled Mild Skin Cleansing Soap Bar With Hydrated Cationic Polymer Skin Conditioner; issued to R. F. Medcalf, Jr., et al. on April 11, 1989 teaches the use of a hydrated cationic polymer in soap bars to improve their mildness.  This specific class of polymers has-been shown to provide the positive skin feel and mildness without compromising lather, provided that hydration of the. polymer is adequate.<br>
Similarly, US Patent No. 4,673,525; titled Ultra Mild Skin Cleansing Composition; issued to L. E. Small, et al. on June 16, 1987 teaches the use of polymeric skin feel additives. They also find that high levels of moisturizer are required. US Patent No. 4,94 6,618; titled Toilet Bar Composition Containing Cationic Guar Gum; issued to J. R. Knochel, et al. on  August 7, 1990 teaches the use of fast hydrating<br><br>
cationic guar gum (among other polymers) as a way of improving skin feel without enhancing grit.<br>
US Patent No. 5,312,559; titled Personal Cleanser With Moisturizer, issued to M. L. Kacher, et al.   on May 17,1994 teaches the use of various cationic additives in semi-solid compositions with high levels of water (40-70%).  US Patent No. 5,338,541; titled Dual Cationic Terpolymers Providing Superior Conditioning Properties In Hair, Skin And Nail Care Products; issued to G. F. Matz, et al. on August 16, 1994 teaches the use of acrylamide terpolymers having a MW &gt;10,000.<br>
US Patent No. 6,001,788, titled Personal Use Soap Bar Compositions Containing Cationic Polymers, issued to R. J. Jaworski, et al. February, 14, 1999 teaches a method of incorporating an unhydrated cationic guar gum in soap bars, and discusses the need for quick hydration.  US Patent No. 6,066,315, titled Ampholyte Polymers For Use In Personal Care Products, issued to A. L. Melby, et al. on May 23, 2000 teaches the use of various specific water soluble ampholytic polymers with high MW (&gt;100,000) for treating keratin that are reportedly superior to previous polymers.<br>
US Patent No. 5,496,488, titled Cleansing Bar Composition Containing Petrolatum Having A Specific Size Range, issued to M. L. Kacher, et al. on March 5, 1996 teaches the use of cationic polymers such as Polyquaternium 10 in bar compositions containing relatively high levels of water (e.g. 10-90%, with 28% being exemplified).  This patent discloses a method for hydrating polymers with high levels<br><br>
of water and thereby serves to minimize grit. Unfortunately, bars with such high levels of water are disadvantageous. Moreover, none of the above references disclose or suggest the conditioning compounds in the toilet bars of the present invention.<br>
US Patent No. 6,057,275, titled Bars Comprising Benefit Agent And Cationic Polymer, issued to M. Fair, et al. on May 2, 2000 teaches specific ratios of cationic to surfactant compounds to enhance deposition.  The ratios disclosed are in the range of 0.06:1 to 1:1.  Conditioning compounds in the present invention are used at significantly lower comparative levels, i.e. in the ratio of conditioning compound to total surfactant compounds of about 0.05:1 to about 0.0001:1; preferably about 0.02:1 to about 0.0001:1. Furthermore, OS Patent No. 6,057,275 discloses that the cationic conditioning compound must be fully hydrated prior to its addition to the bar.<br>
The above mentioned prior art polymers and high molecular weight additives impart a positive moisturized skin feel that consumers appreciate.  However, unlike the inventive additives, many of these polymers require substantial hydration, and the net result is that such compounds have a negative impact on speed of lather and bar feel properties.<br>

In a preferred embodiment of this aspect of the invention, there is more than about 0.1% by wt. of a non-soap anionic surfactant; preferably more than about 0.5% by wt.; and more preferably more than about 1.0% by wt.<br>
Preferably this embodiment of the inventive bar contains an amount of free water in the range of about 5 to about 30% by wt., preferably in the range of about 7 to about 25% by wt, and most preferably in the range of about 10 to about 20% by wt.<br><br>
Surfactants are an essential component of the inventive toilet bar composition.  They are compounds that have hydrophobic and hydrophilic portions that act to reduce the surface tension of the aqueous solutions they are dissolved in.  Useful surfactants can  include anionic, nonionic, amphoteric, and cationic surfactants, and blends thereof.<br>
The inventive toilet bar may contain soap; preferably it contains at least 0.1% by wt. of soap.  The term "soap" is used herein in its popular sense, i.e., the alkali metal or alkanol ammonium salts of alkane- or alkene monocarboxylic acids.  Sodium, potassium, mono-, di- and tri-ethanol ammonium cations, or combinations thereof, are suitable for purposes of this invention.  In general, sodium soaps are used in the compositions of this invention, but from about 1% to about 25% of the soap may be ammonium, potassium, magnesium, calcium or a mixture of these soaps.  The soaps useful herein are the well known alkali metal salts of alkanoic or alkenoic acids having about 12 to 22 carbon atoms, preferably about 12 to about 18 carbon atoms.  They may also be described as alkali metal carboxylates of alkyl or alkene hydrocarbons having about 12 to about 22 carbon atoms.<br>
Soaps having the fatty acid distribution of coconut oil may provide the lower end of the broad molecular weight range. Those soaps having the fatty acid distribution of peanut or rapeseed oil, or their hydrogenated derivatives, may provide the upper end of the broad molecular weight range.<br><br>
It is preferred to use soaps having the. fatty acid distribution of tallow, and vegetable oil.  More preferably the vegetable oil is selected from the group consisting of palm oil, coconut oil, palm kernal oil, palm stearin, and hydrogenated rice bran oil, or mixtures thereof, since these are among the more readily available fats.  Especially preferred is coconut oil.  The proportion of fatty acids having at least 12 carbon atoms in coconut oil soap is about 85%.  This proportion will be greater when mixtures of coconut oil and fats such as tallow, palm oil, or non¬tropical nut oils or fats are used, wherein the principle<br>
chain lengths are C16 and higher.  Preferred soap for use in<br>
the compositions of this invention has at least about 85% fatty acids having about 12-18 carbon atoms.<br>
Coconut oil employed for the soap may be substituted in whole or in part by other "high-lauric" oils, that is, oils or fats wherein at least 50% of the total fatty acids are composed of lauric or myristic acids and mixtures thereof. These oils are generally exemplified by the tropical nut oils of the coconut oil class.  For instance, they include: palm kernel oil, babassu oil, ouricuri oil, tucum oil, cohune nut oil, murumuru oil, jaboty kernel oil, khakan kernel oil, dika nut oil, and ucuhuba butter.<br>
A preferred soap is a mixture of about 15% to about 20% coconut oil and about 8 0% to about 85% tallow.  These mixtures contain about 95% fatty acids having about 12 to about 18 carbon atoms.  As mentioned above, the soap may<br><br>
preferably be prepared from coconut oil, in which case the fatty acid content is about 85% of C12-C18 chain length.<br>
The soaps may contain unsaturation in accordance with commercially acceptable standards.  Excessive unsaturation is normally avoided.<br>
Soaps may be made by the classic kettle boiling process or modern continuous soap manufacturing processes wherein natural fats and oils such as tallow or coconut oil or their equivalents are saponified with an alkali metal hydroxide using procedures well known to those skilled in the art. Alternatively, the soaps may be made by neutralizing fatty<br>
acids, such as lauric (C12) , myristic {C14) , palmitic (C16),<br>
or stearic (C18) acids with an alkali metal hydroxide or carbonate.<br>
A further essential component in compositions according to the invention is a compound of formula (I), such as an amido tertiary amine, an amido amine salt, an amido quaternary ammonium compound, or a combination thereof.  Useful compounds include cocamidopropyl dimethylamine, cocamidopropyl diethylamine, cocamidopropyl diisopropylamine, cocamidopropyl diphenylamine, cocamidopropyl morpholine, cocamidopropyl piperazine, ricinoleamidopropyl dimethylamine, ricinoleamidopropyl diethylamine, ricinoleamidopropyl diisopropylamine, ricinoleamidopropyl diphenylamine, ricinoleamidopropyl morpholine, ricinoleamidopropyl piperazine, stearamido dimethylamine, stearamido diethylamine, stearamido<br><br>
diisopropylamine, stearamido diphenylamine, stearamido morpholine, stearamido piperazine, isotearamido dimethylamine, isotearamido diethylamine, isotearamido diisopropylamine, isotearamido diphenylamine, isotearamido morpholine, isotearamido piperazine, oleamido dimethylamine, oleamido diethylamine, oleamido diisopropylamine, oleamido diphenylamine, oleamido morpholine, oleamido piperazine, behenamido dimethylamine, behenamido. diethylamine, behenamido diisopropylamine, behenamido diphenylamine, behenamido morpholine, behenamido piperazine, wheat germ amido dimethylamine, wheat germ amido diethylamine, wheat germ amido diisopropylamine, wheat germ amido diphenylamine, wheat germ amido morpholine, wheat germ amido piperazine, lauramido dimethylamine, lauramido diethylamine, lauramido diisopropylamine, lauramido diphenylamine, lauramido morpholine, lauramido piperazine, soyamido dimethylamine, soyamido diethylamine, soyamido diisopropylamine, soyamido diphenylamine, soyamido morpholine, soyamido piperazine, octamido dimethylamine, octamido diethylamine, octamido diisopropylamine, octamido diphenylamine, octamido morpholine, octamido piperazine, and sunflower seed amido dimethylamine, sunflower seed  amido diethylamine, sunflower seed amido diisopropylamine, sunflower seed amido diphenylamine, sunflower seed amido morpholine, sunflower seed amido piperazine; their corresponding quaternary ammonium propionate and lactate salts, and their corresponding quaternary ammonium hydrolyzates of silk or wheat protein, and the like.<br><br>
Many of these compounds can be obtained as the Mackine™ Amido Functional Amines, Mackalene™ Amido functional Tertiary Amine Salts, and Mackpro® cationic protein<br>
hydrolysates from the Mclntyre Group Ltd. (University Park, IL) .<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention having a hydrolyzed protein conditioning agent, the average molecular weight of the hydrolyzed protein is preferably about 2500. Preferably 90% of the hydrolyzed protein is between a molecular weight of about 1500 to about 3500.  In a<br>
preferred embodiment, MACKPRO™ WWP (i.e. wheat germ amido<br>
dimethylamine hydrolyzed wheat protein) is added at a concentration of 0.1% (as is) in the bar.  This results in a<br>
MACKPRO™ WWP "solids" of 0.035% in the final bar formula for<br>
this embodiment.<br>
Free fatty acid, as a superfatting agent may be added to the composition according to the present invention at a level of 2-10% on total actives.  This level of free fatty acids can be obtained by the addition of free fatty acids per se or by the addition of a non-fatty acid superfatting agent which protonates a portion of the fatty acid soaps present to form the free fatty acid.  Suitable fatty acid superfatting agents include tallow, coconut, palm and palm-kernel fatty acids. Other fatty acids can be employed, although the low melting point fatty acids, particularly the laurics, are preferred for ease of processing.  Preferred levels of fatty<br><br>
acid are about 3 to about 8 wt.%, most preferably about 5 wt.% based on total actives.<br>
The cleansing composition of the present invention may contain one or more non-soap anionic detergents.  The anionic detergent active which may be used may be aliphatic<br>
sulfonates, such as a primary alkane (a.g., C8-C22) sulfonate, primary alkane (e.g., C8-C22) disulfonate, C8-C22 alkene sulfonate, C8-C22 hydroxyalkane sulfonate or alkyl glyceryl<br>
ether sulfonate (AGS); or aromatic sulfonates such as alkyl benzene sulfonate.<br>
The anionic may also be an alkyl sulfate (e.g., C12-C18 alkyl<br>

The following examples will more fully illustrate the embodiments of this invention. All parts, percentages and proportions referred to herein and in the appended claims are by weight unless otherwise illustrated.  Physical test methods are described below.<br>
Example 1 - Lather and bar feel properties of toilet bars<br>
The lather volume and bar feel properties of inventive and comparative toilet bars formulated with various conditioning compounds according to table 1 were assessed and the results are illustrated in table 3.  Bar feel properties were determined by assessing the sand and slip ratings of the respective bars as provided below.<br>
It was observed that that the inventive toilet bars formulated with cationic additives according to formula (I) enhance lather without negatively impacting sand and slip bar feel properties.  Although not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that certain prior art cationic additives hydrate very slowly, and therefore often lead to<br><br>
negative toilet bar properties such as drag and.sand.  In some embodiments, the inventive conditioning compounds hydrate faster and as a result do not impact on drag and slip.  The two comparative conditioning compounds illustrated in table 1 (i.e. Jaguar C13S &amp;  Mackpro NLW) show an increase in sand and reduction in slip, which the typical consumer does not prefer in a moisturizing bar.<br>
Furthermore, the formulation with Jaguar C13S shows a minimal increase -in lather, probably because it is not substantially hydrated.<br>

Table 2.  Base formulation B used for deposition study<br><br>
Method of bar production<br>
The bar compositions used in the examples herein were formulated by blending all ingredients except the conditioning agent and fragrance for about 30-40 minutes at temperatures of 180-230 °F.  The batch is then cooled and solidified in a spray dryer or a chill roll.  The chips are then mixed with fragrance, and the conditioning agent and optionally triglyceride oil is blended in a chip mixer for about 5-10 minutes.  This is followed by extrusion and stamping into a bar.<br><br><br><br>
Example 2: Skin Deposition Properties<br>
The skin deposition properties of emollients contained in inventive and comparative toilet bars formulated with and without an inventive conditioning compound according to table 2 were assessed and the results are illustrated in table 4.  The method for determining skin deposition is provided below.  The incorporation of-the inventive additive at a very low level (i.e. about 0.03%) enhances emollient deposition significantly.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF TEST METHODS<br>
Skin Deposition Method<br>
The test included 11 subjects using a toilet bar with the inventive conditioning agent, i.e. Mackpro WW?, on both arms and 9 subjects using a comparative bar without an inventive conditioning agent on both arms.<br><br>
Prior to the washing phase of the test, the panelists used Ivory® soap daily on one arm to induce dry skin (dry-down period).  The other arm of each panelist was regarded as normal (not dry) skin.  Panelists were instructed not to apply skin creams or lotions to their arms during this period.<br>
After the dry-down period, panelists washed both arms once<br>
with Ivory® soap. After this pre-wash, a skin site on each<br>
forearm"was extracted using the standard lipid extraction procedure (baseline extraction) as  provided below.  This provided samples to determine baseline extracted stearic acid values.  The purpose of the pre-wash was to remove any soil, sweat, sebum, etc. in order to provide a uniform substrate for examination for wash deposition.<br>
After the baseline extraction, each arm of each panelist was washed with the test bar (same bar on each arm as stated above) using a standard wash and rinse procedure as described below. After rinsing, arms were patted dry with a paper towel and extracted using the standard lipid extraction procedure. Extraction samples were analyzed for stearic acid content<br>
The standard lipid extraction procedure used was as follows:<br>
An open-ended cylinder (3-cm in diameter) was held tightly against the test site.  A measured amount of (2 mls) of solvent (1:1 Isopropanol:acetone mixture) was placed in the cylinder.  The solvent was gently agitated by the glass<br><br>
pipette for 1 minute.  After 1 minute, the solvent was removed from the cylinder with the pipette and the extraction procedure was repeated for a total time of 2 minutes yielding 4 mls. of total extract.<br>
The standard wash and rinse procedure used was as follows:<br>
1.	Wet inner forearm of subject.<br>
2.	Wet bar.<br>
3.	Rotate bar in hand 10 times to generate lather.<br>
4.	With lather in gloved hand wash test site for 30 seconds.<br>
5.	Rinse for 15 seconds.<br>
6.	Gently pat dry.<br>
Sand/Slip Rating Method:<br>
All bars were washed with by panelists for one minute (under running water at approx. 85°F) .  Then each bar was washed with for 10 rotations under running water at approx. 85°F. The bars were then removed from the running water and evaluated for sand and slip by rotating in hand according to the following criteria.  The number of particles refers to the total number of hard, distinct particle's felt by the user over the entire bar.  The area of (bar) face with pumice feel refers to the area of general roughness (apart from distinct hard particles) over a single face of the bar.<br><br><br>
Lather Volume Measurement Procedure .<br>
Apparatus<br>
Two large sinks and a measuring funnel were used.  The measuring funnel is fabricated using a 10.5-inch diameter plastic funnel and a 300 ml graduated cylinder with the bottom cleanly removed.  The cylinder is fitted with the 0 ml mark over the funnel stem.  The cylinder is sealed onto the funnel.<br>
Procedure<br>
a)	Place the funnel at the bottom of the Sink #1. Add tap<br>
water to the sink until the 0 ml mark of the funnel is<br>
reached.<br>
b)	Generate lather.<br>
1)	Run tap on sink #2.<br>
2)	Set temperature at 85 F.<br>
3)	Holding the bar between both hands under running water, rotate the bar for 10 half turns.<br>
4)	Remove hands and bar from under the running water.<br><br>
5)	Rotate the bar 15 half turns.<br>
6)	Lay the bar aside.<br>
7)	Work up the lather for 10 seconds.<br>
8)	Place funnel over hands.<br>
9)	Lower hands and funnel into Sink #1.<br>
10)	When hands are fully immersed, slide from under the funnel.<br>
11)	Lower funnel to the bottom of the sink.<br>
12)	Read the lather volume.<br>
13)	Remove the funnel from Sink #1.<br>
14)	Rinse funnel and hands in sink #2.<br>
