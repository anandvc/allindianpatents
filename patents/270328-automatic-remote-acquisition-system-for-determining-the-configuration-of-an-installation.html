"AUTOMATIC REMOTE ACQUISITION SYSTEM FOR DETERMINING THE CONFIGURATION OF AN INSTALLATION"<br>
SELEX SISTEMI INTEGRATI S.p.A., of Via Tiburtina, 1231, 1-00131 Roma Italy.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
WO 2006/123377<br><br>
PCT/IT2005/00047S<br><br><br>
AUTOMATIC REMOTE ACQUISITION SYSTEM FOR DETERMINING THE CONFIGURATION OF AN INSTALLATION<br>
         TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to an automatic remote acquisition system for determining the configuration of an installation.<br>
The present invention may be used to particular  advantage,  though not exclusively, in an installation installed and activated at different stages, to which the following description refers purely by way of example. BACKGROUND ART<br>
Setting up a technologically advanced installation,  such as a ground system, a submarine, etc., represents an enormous investment on the part of the owner, who, to safeguard his investment, often requests that the manufacturer or installation firm also provide for high-level, long-term servicing of the installation. In fact, 25 it is not unusual for a technologically advanced installation to continue operating well past its time, e.g. even 40 years after it is installed, thanks to continual  technological  updating  of  the  original<br><br><br>
WO 2006/123377	PCT/IT2005/00047K<br>
installation structure.<br>
Servicing an installation normally comprises:<br>
-	repairs;<br>
-	spare parts supply;<br>
        - customized installation programming and updating;<br>
-	running the installation;<br>
-	training of installation technicians;<br>
-	integration with the owner's existing equipment or servicing procedures.<br>
    Servicing involves working in collaboration with installation technicians, which means devising, in conjunction with installation technicians, appropriate processes to maximize efficiency and prompt service, and to keep track of the work carried out and the equipment<br>
    installed, so that the exact configuration of the installation is known at all times. In other words, the manufacturer or installation firm must maintain full control over the servicing chain, in the sense of knowing exactly the configuration of the installation and the<br>
    availability of spare parts and servicing material.<br>
A computer network is a definite and indispensable aid to all aspects of servicing work, by constructing and maintaining a centralized data bank constituting an inventory of parts and elementary units (LRU - "Logic<br>
   Replaceable Unit") of which the installation is composed.  A centralized data bank, however, is only effective to the extent that the data in it is correct, updated and reliable.<br><br><br>
WO 2006/123377	PCT/IT2005/0O0478<br><br>
The parts and elementary units of an installation are identified using various identification systems, one of the cheapest of which is based on the use of bar codes. More specifically, an unequivocal bar code is   assigned to each part and each elementary unit in the installation, and is normally printed on a label applied to the respective installation part or elementary unit.<br>
A bar code system, however, is not the best or most efficient  solution to the  above problems,  for  the    following main reasons:<br>
-	the enormous number of references involved, and<br>
the complex, variable, and, very often, unique nature of<br>
the elementary units associated with the references; a<br>
bar code system therefore calls for continually producing<br>
    and applying different labels, and for appropriate printers, thus increasing running costs (labels, ribbons, maintenance).<br>
-	in non-industrial environments, reading bar code<br>
labels  is  intentional,  and  is  therefore  performed<br>
    manually by the operator on a portable terminal;<br>
-	remote bar code reading is only possible using highly complex systems (multiple or robotized readers);<br>
-	bar codes are read sequentially (one at a time) , so that inventories take longer;<br>
    - a bar code has no memory, the only information being the code reading, which is decoded by access to the data bank; and<br>
-	to be changed, a bar code label must be physically<br><br><br>
WO 2006/123377	PCT/IT2005/00047S<br>
replaced.<br>
The drawbacks of the bar code system can be eliminated using a known RFid ("Radio Frequency Identification") system, which is based on the use of<br>
   radiofreguency tags known as "tag transponders" or, more simply, "transponders", which are applied to respective elementary units for identification.<br>
As shown in Figure 1, a transponder 101 typically comprises a microchip 102 having an electronic memory<br>
   (not shown); and a normally miniaturized antenna 103. In actual use, transponder 101 is excited, via antenna 103, by the electromagnetic field generated by an external (fixed or portable) RFid read/write device 104, with which it dialogues by radio, and to which it returns the<br>
   identification code and/or any other information memorized in microchip 102. The external RFid read/write device 104 is normally connectable to a computer device 105 for collecting the identification code and/or any other memorized information.<br>
    Transponder 101 also comprises a capacitor (not shown) , in which case, transponder 101 is passive, or a small battery (not shown), in which case, transponder 101 is active. Transponder 101 may also be rewritable, for remote programming with additional data, or for complete<br>
    reprogramming with a new "identity".<br>
Figure 2 shows a few examples of transponders 101 of different sizes, which depend on performance requirements, and on the size of the elementary units to<br><br><br>
WO 2006/123377	PCT/IT2005/00047S<br>
which they are applied.<br>
RFid technology provides for solving almost all the drawbacks of bar codes, in that each transponder:<br>
-	identifies a respective part or elementary unit of<br>
   the installation with an unequivocal code memorized in<br>
its microchip, and is capable of acquiring and memorizing additional data and making it available substantially in real time;<br>
-	is of the desired shape and size, and can be<br>
    covered with appropriate material  for the type  of<br>
operation involved;<br>
can be reused, in production or logistics, to perform an infinite number of read/write operations;<br>
unlike bar code labels,  can be used in any  environment,  i.e.  in  the  presence  of  dirt,  water, detergents,   paint,   chemical   solvents,   and  high temperature;<br>
-	is readable even when concealed, in inaccessible<br>
conditions, free-handedly, and unattended;<br>
   - is recommended when the respective installation part or component is "followed" by additional data, and so involves memorizing and/or reading data relating, for example, to work progress, maintenance work carried out, tracking, product tracing or authentication (imitation<br>
    prevention : cannot be photocopied); and<br>
-	prevents theft, with the provision of appropriate<br>
security thresholds.<br>
Notwithstanding  all  this,  inventory  work  is<br><br><br>
WO 2006/123377	PCT/IT2005/00047X<br>
hampered, and inventory data made outdated, by a whole host of installation configuration changes that are difficult to trace. Outdated inventory data, in particular, can be attributed to the type of installation    and the maintenance work carried out, for example:<br>
remote installation that cannot be moved for reasons of security or non-stop service;<br>
-	emergency configuration repairs and changes;<br>
configuration  changes  made  by  installation    operatives without informing the Service Department;<br>
inaccessible  installation,  e.g.  stationed  in military or reserved areas.<br>
Moreover, the RFid identification system is affected by transponder read noise - particularly in the case of  passive transponders - caused by numerous situations, in which the magnetic component of the electromagnetic field generated by the RFid read/write device is distorted or attenuated to the point of drastically reducing the energy absorbed by the transponder antenna. More    specifically, transponder reading is disturbed by:<br>
-	reflection of the electromagnetic field on metal<br>
walls or walls made of electrically conducting material<br>
in the vicinity of the transponder ("echo" effect);<br>
distortion of the electromagnetic  field flux  lines, caused by the presence of metal or electrically conducting material in the vicinity of the transponder;<br>
-	the presence of pole fluids (such as distilled<br>
water) which absorb the magnetic component; and<br><br><br>
WO 2006/123377	PCT/IT2005/000478<br>
- stray capacitances introduced by metal walls of installation parts or elementary units, to which the transponder is fitted.<br>
The presence of metal in the vicinity of the   transponder, in particular, impairs the signal/noise S/N ratio of the transponder to the extent of making the transponder unsuitable for use close to electronic circuits, which greatly increase ambient electromagnetic noise.         <br>
DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The  automatic  remote  acquisition  system  for<br>
 determining the  configuration of an installation  in<br>
accordance with the present  invention  - hereinafter<br>
referred to simply as STC system - observes the following<br>
guide lines:<br><br><br>
WO 2006/123377	PCT/IT2005/000478<br>
- use  of  "open"  technology  to  permit  system scalability, maintenance, and incremental growth;<br>
- modular construction for smooth migration to future technology; <br>
 - use of standard interface and connectivity solutions to permit integration in the installation of additional COTS ("Commercial Off The Shelf") equipment of different makes;<br>
-	use of state-of-the-art COTS components; and <br>
-low running cost.<br>
An installation 1 (Figure 3) normally comprises a number of different types of elementary units 2 (Figure 3) , such as radars, display equipment, dedicated computers, work stations, etc., which may also differ as   to version or degree of customization. Elementary units 2 are assigned respective identification codes, which are grouped into varying configurations defining subsystems incorporated in further, more complex higher-level, subsystems according to a specific multilevel    hierarchical structure.<br>
The Figure 3 example shows grouping of the identification codes, and therefore of the relative elementary units 2, in a four-level hierarchical structure organized by devices 3, cabinets 4, and control rooms 5. At the top of the hierarchical structure, control rooms 5 are connected to a central control device 6 comprising a central data bank 7, e.g. a SAP database, for  storing and updating  information concerning  the<br><br><br>
WO 2006/123377	PCT/IT2005/000478<br>
configuration of installation 1.<br>
Figure 4 shows one configuration of installation l associated with a control room 5 (Figure 3) , and which comprises a first number of four cabinets 4, each housing  a number of devices forming part of a first main family of devices hereinafter referred to as standard devices 3a; and a second number of three containers 8, each housing a device forming part of a second family of devices hereinafter referred to as non-standard devices<br>
    3b.<br>
Standard devices 3a are of standard shape and size, and comprise basic elementary units 2 typically organized by cabinets 4 and hereinafter indicated 2a. Figure 5 shows an example of a cabinet 4 comprising a number of<br>
    racks 9 for supporting respective standard devices 3a, each in turn comprising a respective number of elementary units 2a.<br>
Figure 6 shows a non-standard device. 3b, which comprises heterogeneous elementary units 2 - such as<br>
    displays, power supplies, junction-box plates, antennas, TWT devices, mass storage units, customized electronic boards, interfaces, COTS systems, etc. - housed in a relative container 8 normally difficult to access and inspect, and which are hereinafter indicated 2b.<br>
    It should be pointed out that no clear distinction exists between standard and non-standard devices 3a and 3b, which may alternate within the levels of the Figure 3 hierarchical structure.<br><br><br>
WO 2006/123377	PCT/IT2005/00047S<br><br>
With reference to Figure 4, number 10 indicates the STC system of control room 5 according to the present invention. STC system 10 comprises an automatic identification system 11 based on RFid transponder   technology to read and/or modify identification data -including the identification code mentioned previously -relative to elementary units 2a, 2b (Figures 5 and 6) of installation 1; a data gathering and management system 12 for gathering and organizing data read and/or modified by<br>
    identification system 11; said central data bank 7 located remotely with respect to installation 1 and for memorizing and updating identification data of all elementary units 2a, 2b alongside configuration changes to installation 1; and a data transmission system 13 for<br>
   data exchange between data gathering and management system 12 and central data bank 7.<br>

Passive transponders 14 operate to ISO/IEC standard 15693, i.e. operate at a nominal radiofrequency Fl of 13.56 MHz, and have a memory capacity Ml of 1 Kbit to 2 Kbytes and a read range Dl of 10 to 120 cm.<br>
       As shown in Figure 5, for each rack 9 of cabinet 4, identification  system  11  comprises  a  substantially straight antenna 15, which has an internal impedance of 50 ohms, is 19" long, has a respective antenna output 16, and is mounted longitudinally, by a Velcro fastener (not<br>
    shown), to a side 17 of respective rack 9. Passive transponders 14 are mounted to walls 18 of respective elementary units 2a facing side 17 of rack 9, so as to facilitate electromagnetic coupling of antenna 15 and passive transponders 14, and so facilitate reading and<br>
    writing of passive transponders 14.<br>
As shown in Figure 5, identification system 11 also comprises a control unit 19 integrated in each cabinet 4, and for reading and/or modifying the identification data of elementary units 2a memorized in respective passive<br>

   device 23 to transfer the identification data of elementary units 2a in cabinet 4 between respective passive transponders 14 and data gathering and management system 12 (Figure 4) at each interrogation cycle. Control unit 19 is connected to data gathering and management<br>
   system 12 (Figure 4) over a respective coaxial output cable 25.<br>
With reference to Figure 4, identification system 11 comprises a number of active transponders 26, each fitted to container 8 of a respective non-standard device 3b,<br>
    and for memorizing an inventory of elementary units 2b of non-standard device 3b. The inventory is constructed on the basis of the identification data of elementary units 2b memorized in respective passive transponders 14.<br>
Active  transponders  26  operate  at  a  nominal<br>
    radiofreguency F2 of 868 MHz, have a memory capacity M2 greater than memory capacity Ml - more specifically, of up to 64 Kbytes - and have a read range D2 greater than read range Dl - more specifically, of 6 to 100 m.<br><br><br>
WO 2006/123377	PCT/IT2005/000478<br>
Identification system 11 also comprises at least one updating unit 27 (Figure 6) for updating the inventories of elementary units 2b of non-standard devices 3b, memorized in respective active transponders 26, with the  identification data of all the elementary units 2b memorized in respective passive transponders 14. For which purpose, updating unit 27 has an RFid read/write device (not shown) for passive transponders 14, and an RFid  read/write  device   (not  shown)   for  active<br>
 	transponders 26.<br>
In a further embodiment (not shown) of the present invention,  updating  unit  2 7  is  portable,  i.e.  is incorporated, for example, in a portable computer (PDA). As shown in Figure 4, identification system 11 also<br>
    comprises an RFid read/write device 28, for active transponders 26, located in a fixed position at a distance from non-standard devices 3b of no more than maximum read range D2, to read and/or modify the inventory data of elementary units 2b of non-standard<br>
   devices 3b memorized in respective active transponders 26.<br>
With reference to Figure 4, data gathering and management system 12 comprises an Ethernet local communication network (LAN) 29 having a repeater device<br>
   (LAN hub) 30 connected to output cables 25 of control units 19 integrated in cabinets 4; and a host 31 associated with control room 5 and loaded with a program for  managing  and  automating  acquisition  of  the<br><br><br>
WO 2006/123377	PCT/IT2005/000478<br><br>
identification data of elementary units 2a, 2b. Host 31 is connected to repeater device 30, to RFid read/write device 28, and to data transmission system 13, to transfer the identification data acquired by   identification system 11 to data transmission system 13. In another further embodiment (not shown) of the present invention, local communication network 29 is a wireless type (WiFi), i.e. operating to IEEE standard 8 02.11b/g. More specifically, control units 19 (Figure 5)<br>
   integrated in cabinets 4 are provided, at the output, with respective WiFi transceivers for radio connection to a WiFi access device ("Access Point") connected to host 31. The access device thus defines a wireless access network with "hot spot" radio coverage.<br>
    Data transmission system 13 is bidirectional, in that data must flow to central data bank 7, but peripheral updating must also be possible of the identification data memorized in individual passive transponders 14.<br>
    As shown in Figure 4, data transmission system 13 comprises a fixed telecommunication network 32, e.g. a telephone network; a wide-band network, or any other type of fixed network, connected directly to host 31 over a modem or network board; a radio telecommunication network<br>
   33, such as a GPRS, UMTS, satellite network, etc., to which host 31 is connected by a GPRS, UMTS or satellite board; and a portable computer 34 connectable to host 31 and to central data bank 7 by standard communication<br><br><br>
WO 2006/123377	PCT/IT2005/00047S<br>
ports, e.g. RS232, USB, etc., to carry the identification data when fixed telecommunication network 32 and radio telecommunication network 33 cannot be used.<br>

Passive transponder 14 comprises an antenna 35 designed to guarantee read range Dl; a memory 3 6 having an EEPROM microchip of memory capacity Ml to memorize the identification data of respective elementary<br>
    unit 2; a digital control block 37 for controlling reading and writing of data in memory 36; and a radiofrequency analog block, hereinafter referred to simply as RF block 38, connected between antenna 35 and digital control block 3 7 to demodulate and modulate the<br>
    radiofrequency signals received by and transmitted to antenna 35 respectively.<br>
RF block 38 in turn comprises a demodulating unit 39; a modulating unit 40; a synchronizing unit 41 for generating  a  synchronous  clock  signal  required  for<br>
operation of digital control block 37; and a power unit<br>
42 for converting part of the power of the radiofrequency<br>
signal received by antenna 35 into direct-voltage power<br>
for supply to all the active electronic circuits of<br>
passive transponder 14.<br>
   Figure 8 shows a detail of RF block 38, and in particular a block diagram of power unit 42, which comprises a matching network 43 connected downstream from antenna 35; a voltage multiplier 44 cascade-connected to<br><br><br>
WO 2006/123377	PCT/IT2005/000478<br><br>
matching network 43; and a voltage regulator 45 cascade-connected to voltage multiplier 44 and having a direct-voltage power output 46.<br>
With reference to Figure 9, matching network 43  comprises an LC circuit 47 connected directly to antenna 35 to form a resonant circuit with a resonance frequency equal, in operating conditions, to nominal radiofrequency Fl. In Figure 9, in fact, antenna 35 is represented by an equivalent circuit 48 connected to LC circuit 47 to form 10  an antenna resonant circuit.<br>
When passive transponder 14 is fitted to a wall of elementary unit 2a, 2b made of metal or electrically conducting material, a parasitic capacitance generates between the metal wall and passive transponder 14, which  parasitic capacitance adds to the capacitance C of the LC circuit, and reduces the resonance frequency by an amount<br>
hereinafter referred to as frequency shift FS depending on the  type of material. According to the present invention, the capacitance C and inductance L 20 values are designed to bring the freely operating resonance frequency, i.e. in the absence of the metal wall, to a value of :<br>
Fl + FS so that, in operating conditions, i.e. when fitted to the  metal wall, passive transponder 14 can actually operate at a resonance frequency equal to nominal radiofrequency Fl.<br>
"Programmed"  frequency  shift  FS  and  subsequent<br><br><br>
WO 2006/123377	PCT/IT2005/000478<br>
realignment, in operating conditions, with nominal value Fl improve the signal/noise S/N ratio of passive transponder 14, i.e. provide for a signal/noise S/N ratio of  values  typical  of  operation  in  high-immunity<br>
   conditions to ambient electromagnetic noise. Which means passive transponders 14 may even be fitted to elementary units 2a, 2b comprising working electronic circuits, i.e. in the presence of severe electromagnetic noise.<br>
By simply making, and applying passive transponder<br>
   14 to, a cross-shaped incision (not shown) on the metal wall of elementary unit 2a, 2b, tests have shown an increase in magnetic coupling between antenna 3 5 of passive transponder 14 - and the antenna of an RFid read/write device 23 interrogating passive transponder<br>
    14. This is explained as follows.<br>
, Antenna 3 5 of passive transponder 14 typically comprises a number of metal, substantially complete turns of appropriate length and wound parallel to an antenna plane normally parallel to the metal wall to which<br>
    passive transponder 14 is applied. The field lines magnetically coupling antenna 3 5 of passive transponder 14 and the antenna of RFid read/write device 23 (Figure 5) travel through the turns of antenna 15 perpendicularly to the antenna plane, and are therefore cut by the metal<br>
  wall. This distortion in magnetic coupling reduces the<br>
radiofrequency energy transferred from RFid read/write<br>
. device 23 to passive transponder 14. In other words, the<br>
metal wall amounts to a virtual turn closely coupled<br><br><br>
WO 2006/123377	PCT/IT2005/000478<br>
magnetically to antenna 35 of passive transponder 14, and antenna 35 and the metal wall combine to actually form a virtual transformer, the primary circuit of which is defined by antenna 35, and the secondary circuit of which   is defined by the short-circuited virtual turn, on which most of the radiofreguency energy transmitted by RFid read/write device 23 is dissipated.<br>
Making such a cross-shaped incision on the metal wall, at the point at which antenna 15 of passive   transponder 14 is located, therefore opens the virtual turn, thus improving magnetic coupling between antenna 15 of passive transponder 14 and the RFid read/write device 23.<br>
With reference to Figures 4, 5 and 6, to update    central data bank 7 with the data of all the elementary units 2 of installation 1, this is done as follows.<br>
Data gathering and management system 12 activates host 31 to interrogate control units 19 in cabinets 4 and the RFid read/write device 28 associated with control    room 5.<br>
Control unit 19 in each cabinet 4 responds by performing an interrogation cycle - in particular, a read cycle - to read, over relative antennas 15, the identification data of all of elementary units 2a   memorized in respective passive transponders 14 in cabinet 4.<br>
RFid read/write device 28, on the other hand, reads the inventories of elementary units 2b of non-standard<br><br><br>
WO 2006/123377	PCT/IT2005/00047S<br>
devices 3b directly from all the active transponders 26. The information in the inventories memorized in active transponders 26 is kept updated by updating unit 27 with the identification data of elementary units 2b memorized    in respective passive transponders 14  <br>
At this point, host 31 gathers the identification data read from passive transponders 14 in cabinets 4 and from active transponders 26, and organizes it for transfer over data transmission system 13 to central data 10 bank 7, thus permitting remote, automatic acquisition of the configuration of installation 1.<br>
STC system 10 according to the present invention, has the following main advantages:<br>
-	it provides, in practically one read and/or write<br>
    operation, for interrogating all the passive transponders<br>
14 and active transponders 26 substantially simultaneously, thus permitting fast, automatic, remote, collision-free identification of all the elementary units 2a, 2b of installation 1; 20 - it can be applied to any configuration of installation 1, in terms of combinations of active transponders 26 and passive transponders 14;<br>
-	each transponder may contain the history of a<br>
given elementary unit 2a, 2b, e.g. specific authorization<br>
 	 of divisions or individuals to work on the unit, material and organizational flow involved in producing, marketing and supplying the unit, etc.; and<br>
technical   documentation   and   spare  parts<br><br><br>
WO 2006/123377	PCT/IT2005/000478<br>
catalogues, nowadays mostly available in electronic form, may be used to provide operatives and maintenance personnel of installation 1 with the exact configuration of installation 1 in terms of installed elementary units    2.<br>
STC system 10 according to the present invention also has the following further advantages:<br>
-	it eliminates or at least reduces the effect of<br>
stray capacitances between passive transponder 14 and the<br>
    metal walls of elementary units 2a, 2b of installation 1, to which passive transponder 14 is fitted;<br>
-	it reduces the signal/noise S/N ratio of passive<br>
transponder 14 to values enabling passive transponder 14<br>
to be applied to functioning electronic circuits; and<br>
   - it improves magnetic coupling between antenna   of passive transponder 14 and the antenna of the interrogating RFid read/write device 23.<br><br><br>
