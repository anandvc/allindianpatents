Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a lithium<br>
secondary battery having a charge-cutoff voltage of<br>
4.35V or higher. More particularly, the present<br>
invention, relates to a lithium secondary battery, which<br>
has a charge cut-off voltage of between 4.35V and 4.6V,<br>
high capacity, high output and improved safety and is<br>
provided with capacity balance suitable for a high-<br>
voltage battery by controlling the weight ratio (A/C) of<br>
both electrode active materials, i.e., weight ratio of<br>
anode active material (A) to cathode active material (C)<br>
per unit area of each electrode.<br>
Background Art<br>
Recently, as electronic devices become smaller and<br>
lighter, batteries used therein as power sources are<br>
increasingly required to have a compact size and light<br>
weight. As rechargeable batteries with a compact size,<br>
light weight and high capacity, lithium secondary<br>
batteries such as secondary lithium ion batteries have<br>
been put to practical use and widely used in portable<br>
electronic and communication devices such as compact<br>
camcorders, portable phones, notebook PCs, etc.<br>
A lithium secondary battery comprises a cathode,<br>
anode and an electrolyte. Lithium secondary batteries<br>
are classified into liquid electrolyte lithium secondary<br>
batteries using an electrolyte comprising a liquid<br>
organic solvent and lithium polymer batteries using an<br>
electrolyte comprising a polymer.<br><br><br>
Although lithium having high electronegativity and<br>
high capacity per unit mass has been used as electrode<br>
active material for a lithium secondary battery, there<br>
is a problem in that lithium cannot ensure the stability<br>
of a battery by itself. Therefore, many attempts have<br>
been made to develop batteries using a material capable<br>
of lithium ion intercalation/deintercalation as<br>
electrode active material.<br>
Cathode active materials that are currently used<br>
in lithium secondary batteries include lithium-<br>
containing transition metal composite oxides such as<br>
LiCo02, LiNi02, LiMn204, LiMn02 and LiFe02. Particularly,<br>
LiCo02 providing excellent electroconductivity, high<br>
voltage and excellent electrode characteristics is a<br>
typical example of commercially available cathode active<br>
materials. As anode active materials, carbonaceous<br>
materials capable of intercalation/deintercalation of<br>
lithium ions in an electrolyte are used. Additionally,<br>
polyethylene-based porous polymers are used as<br>
separators. A lithium secondary battery formed by using<br>
a cathode, anode and an electrolyte as described above<br>
permits repeated charge/discharge cycles, because<br>
lithium ions deintercalated from the cathode active<br>
material upon the first charge cycle serve to transfer<br>
energies while they reciprocate between both electrodes<br>
(for example, they are intercalated into carbon<br>
particles forming the anode active material and then<br>
deintercalated upon a discharge cycle).<br>
In order to provide such lithium secondary<br>
batteries having high capacity, output and voltage, it<br>
is necessary to increase the theoretically available<br>
capacity of the cathode active material in a battery. To<br><br><br><br>
satisfy this, it is required that the charge-cutoff<br>
voltage of a battery is increased. Conventional<br>
batteries having a charge-cutoff voltage of 4.2V using<br>
LiCo02 among the above-described cathode active<br>
materials, utilize only about 55% of the theoretically<br>
available capacity of LiCo02 by<br>
intercalation/deintercalation processes. Therefore,<br>
selection of the anode active material in such batteries<br>
is limited so as to be conformed to the capacity of<br>
lithium ions to be deintercalated from the cathode. When<br>
such batteries are overcharged to a voltage of 4.35V or<br>
higher, the anode has no sites into which an excessive<br>
amount of lithium ions deintercalated from the cathode<br>
are intercalated. Therefore, lithium dendrite growth<br>
occurs, resulting in problems of rapid exothermic<br>
reactions and poor safety of the batteries.<br>
Additionally, side reactions between the cathode and<br>
electrolyte may occur to cause degradation of the<br>
cathode surface and oxidation of electrolyte.<br>

Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Therefore, the present invention has been made in<br>
view of the above-mentioned problems occurring in<br>
manufacturing a high-capacity battery having charge-<br>
cutoff voltages over 4.35V. We have found that when the<br>
weight ratio (A/C) of anode active material (A) to<br>
cathode active material (C) per unit area of each<br>
electrode is controlled to an optimized condition, it is<br>
possible to ensure a plurality of sites into which an<br>
excessive amount of lithium ions deintercalated from a<br>
cathode can be intercalated. We have also found that it<br>
is possible to reduce side reactions between a cathode<br>
and electrolyte by controlling the particle diameter<br>
(particle size) of a cathode active material, and thus<br>
to improve the safety of a high-voltage battery.<br>
Therefore, it is an object of the present<br>
invention to provide a high-capacity lithium secondary<br>
battery that has a charge-cutoff voltage of between<br>
4.35V and 4.6V and is stable even under overcharge<br>
conditions.<br>
According to an aspect of the present invention,<br>
there is provided a lithium secondary battery comprising<br>
a cathode (C) , an anode (A), a separator and an<br>
electrolyte, wherein the battery has a weight ratio<br>
(A/C) of anode active material to cathode active<br>
material per unit area of each electrode of between 0.44<br>
and 0.70, and shows a charge cut-off voltage of between<br>
4.35V and 4.6V.<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention will be<br>
explained in more detail.<br>
According to the present invention, the high-<br>
voltage lithium secondary battery showing charge-cutoff<br><br>
voltages over 4.35V, for example a high-output lithium<br>
secondary battery showing a charge-cutoff voltage of<br>
between 4.35V and 4.6V is characterized in that whose<br>
capacity balance is satisfied by controlling the weight<br>
ratio (A/C) of anode active material (A) to cathode<br>
active material (C) per unit area of each electrode.<br>
The present invention characterized by the above-<br>
mentioned weight ratio provides the following effects.<br>
(1) The high-voltage battery having a charge-cutoff<br>
voltage of 4.35V or higher according to the present<br>
invention can show improved safety as well as higher<br>
capacity, voltage and output compared to conventional<br>
batteries having a charge-cutoff voltage of 4.2V.<br>
Japanese Laid-Open Patent No. 2001-68168 discloses<br>
a high-voltage battery having a charge cut-off voltage<br>
of 4.35V or higher, wherein the battery uses a cathode<br>
active material doped with transition metals or non-<br>
transition metals such as Ge, Ti, Zr, Y and Si so as to<br>
show such high voltage. When the battery is charged to a<br>
voltage higher than 4.35V, a great amount of lithium<br>
ions are deintercalated from the cathode. However, the<br>
anode has no sites into which such excessive amount of<br>
lithium ions can be intercalated, resulting in a rapid<br>
drop in battery safety.<br>
On the contrary, the lithium secondary battery<br>
according to the present invention is designed so that<br>
capacity balance can be satisfied by the presence of<br>
multiple anode sites, into which an excessive amount of<br>
lithium ions deintercalated from the cathode while the<br>
battery is charged to a voltage of 4.35V or higher,<br>
obtained by controlling the weight ratio (A/C) of anode<br>
active material (A.) to cathode active material (C) per<br><br><br>
unit area of each electrode. Therefore, the lithium<br>
secondary battery according to the present invention not<br>
only can provide high capacity and high output but also<br>
can solve the safety-related problem occurring in the<br>
high-voltage battery according to the prior art.<br>
(2) Additionally, the lithium secondary battery<br>
according to the present invention can prevent side<br>
reactions between the cathode active material and<br>
electrolyte, which may occur under overcharge conditions<br>
(over 4.35V), by controlling the particle diameter<br>
(size) of cathode active material, and thus prevent a<br>
drop in battery safety.<br>
In other words, as the specific surface area of a<br>
cathode active material increases, side reactions<br>
between a cathode active material and electrolyte<br>
increase. Therefore, the lithium secondary battery<br>
according to the present invention uses a cathode active<br>
material with a particle size greater than that of a<br>
currently used cathode active material so as to reduce<br>
the specific surface area of the cathode active<br>
material. Additionally, in order to prevent loss in<br>
reaction kinetics in the battery caused by the use of<br>
the cathode active material having such a large particle<br>
diameter, it is possible to control the loading amount<br>
of each electrode active material per unit area in the<br>
cathode and anode, and thus to realize improvement in<br>
battery safety.<br>
(3) Further, the lithium secondary battery<br>
according to the present invention can significantly<br>
increase the available capacity and average discharge<br>
voltage of a battery, even when using a lithium cobalt-<br>
based cathode active material such as LiCo02 that<br><br><br>
provides only about 55% of its theoretically available<br>
capacity by intercalation/deintercalation processes in a<br>
conventional battery having a charge-cutoff voltage of<br>
4.2V. In fact, the following experimental examples show<br>
that although the lithium secondary battery according to<br>
the present invention uses LiCo02 in the same manner as a<br>
conventional battery, the battery provides an available<br>
capacity of LiCo02 increased by at least 14% (see, Table<br>
1) -<br>
According to the present invention, the range of<br>
charge-cutoff voltages of the lithium secondary battery<br>
may be controlled in order to provide a high voltage and<br>
output of 4.35V or higher. Otherwise, the cathode active<br>
material used in the battery may be doped or substituted<br>
with another element, or may be. surface-treated with a<br>
chemically stable substance.<br>
More particularly, the lithium secondary battery<br>
according to the present invention has a charge-cutoff<br>
voltage of 4.35V or higher, preferably of between 4.35V<br>
and 4.6V. When the battery has a charge-cutoff voltage<br>
of lower than 4.35V, it is substantially the same as a<br>
conventional 4.2V battery and does not show an increase<br>
in the available capacity of a cathode active material<br>
so that a high-capacity battery cannot be designed and<br>
obtained. Additionally, when the battery has a charge-<br>
cutoff voltage of higher than 4.6V, the cathode active<br>
material used in the battery may experience a rapid<br>
change in structure due to the presence of the H13 phase<br>
generated in the cathode active material. In this case,<br>
there are problems in that transition metal is dissolved<br>
out of a lithium transition metal composite oxide used<br>
as cathode active material and oxygen loss may occur.<br><br><br>
Further, as the charge-cutoff voltage increases,<br>
reactivity between the cathode and electrolyte also<br>
increases, resulting in problems including explosion of<br>
the battery.<br>
The anode active material that may be used in the<br>
high-voltage lithium secondary battery having charge-<br>
cutoff voltages over 4.35V according to the present<br>
invention includes conventional anode active materials<br>
known to one skilled in the art (for example, materials<br>
capable of lithium ion intercalation/ deintercalation).<br>
There is no particular limitation in selection of the<br>
anode active material. Non-limiting examples of the<br>
anode active material include lithium alloys,<br>
carbonaceous materials, inorganic oxides, inorganic<br>
chalcogenides, nitrides, metal complexes or organic<br>
polymer compounds. Particularly preferred are amorphous<br>
or crystalline carbonaceous materials.<br>
The cathode active material that may be used in<br>
the high-voltage lithium secondary battery having<br>
charge-cutoff voltages over 4.35V according to the<br>
present invention includes conventional cathode active<br>
materials known to one skilled in the art (for example,<br>
lithium-containing composite oxides having at least one<br>
element selected from the group consisting of alkali<br>
metals, alkaline earth metals, Group 13 elements, Group<br>
14 elements, Group 15 elements, transition metals and<br>
rare earth elements) . There is no particular limitation<br>
in selection of the cathode active material. Non-<br>
limiting examples of the cathode active material include<br>
various types of lithium transition metal composite<br>
oxides (for example, lithium manganese composite oxides<br>
such as LiMn204; lithium nickel oxides such as LiNi02;<br>
'<br><br>
lithium cobalt oxides such as LiCoC^; lithium iron<br>
oxides; the above-described oxides in which manganese,<br>
nickel, cobalt or iron is partially doped or substituted<br>
with other transition metals or non-transition metals<br>
(for example, Al, Mg, Zr, Fe, Zn, Ga, Si, Ge or<br>
combinations thereof); lithium-containing vanadium<br>
oxides; and chalcogenides (for example, manganese<br>
dioxide, titanium disulfide, molybdenum disulfide,<br>
etc.).<br>
As cathode active material, lithium cobalt<br>
composite oxides optionally doped with Al, Mg, Zr, Fe,<br>
Zn, Ga, Sn, Si and/or Ge are preferable and LiCo02 is<br>
more preferable. Even if LiCo02 is used as cathode active<br>
material in the same manner as conventional batteries,<br>
the lithium secondary battery according to the present<br>
invention can provide an increase in available capacity<br>
of the cathode active material and thus can be a high-<br>
voltage battery due to a suitable design in electrodes.<br>
In the high-voltage battery having a charge-cutoff<br>
voltage of 4.35V or higher according to the present<br>
invention, the weight ratio (A/C) of anode active<br>
material (A) to cathode active material (C) per unit<br>
area of each electrode ranges suitably from 0.44 to 0.70<br>
and more preferably from 0.5 to 0.64. When the weight<br>
ratio is less than 0.44, the battery is substantially<br>
the same as a conventional 4.2V-battery. Therefore, when<br>
the battery is overcharged to 4.35V or higher, the<br>
capacity balance may be broken to cause dendrite growth<br>
on the surface of anode, resulting in short-circuit in<br>
the battery and a rapid drop in the battery capacity.<br>
When the weight ratio is greater than 0.64, an excessive<br>
amount of lithium sites exists undesirably in the anode,<br><br><br>
resulting in a drop in energy density per unit<br>
volume/mass of the battery.<br>
According to the present invention, such<br>
controlled weight ratio of anode active material to<br>
cathode active material per unit area of each electrode<br>
can be obtained preferably by using LiCo02, LiNiMnCo02 or<br>
LiNiMn02 having a capacity similar to that of LiCo02,<br>
etc., as cathode active material and using graphite as<br>
anode active material. When high-capacity cathode<br>
materials such as Ni-containing materials and/or high-<br>
capacity anode materials such as Si are used, it is<br>
possible to design and manufacture an optimized lithium<br>
secondary battery having high capacity, high output and<br>
improved safety through recalculation of the weight<br>
ratio considering a different capacity. However, the<br>
scope of the present invention is not limited to the<br>
above-mentioned cathode active materials and anode<br>
active materials.<br>
The cathode active materials used in the lithium<br>
secondary battery according to the present invention<br>
(for example, LiCo02) have a problem in that they are<br>
deteriorated in terms of thermal properties when being<br>
-charged to 4.35V or higher. - To prevent- the -problem,—it<br>
is possible to control the specific surface area of the<br>
cathode active material.<br>
As the particle size of the cathode active<br>
material increases (in other words, as the specific<br>
surface area of the cathode active material decreases),<br>
reactivity between the cathode active material and<br>
electrolyte may decrease, resulting in improvement in<br>
thermal stability. For this reason, it is preferable to<br>
use a cathode active material having a particle diameter<br><br>
larger than that of a currently used cathode active<br>
material. Therefore, the cathode active material used in<br>
the battery according to the present invention<br>
preferably has a particle diameter (particle size) of<br>
between 5 and 30 pm- When the cathode active material has<br>
a particle diameter of less than' 5 jj&amp;, side reactions<br>
between the cathode and electrolyte increase to cause<br>
the problem of poor safety of the battery. When the<br>
cathode active material has a particle diameter of<br>
greater than 30 [Mr reaction kinetics may be slow in the<br>
battery.<br>
Additionally, in order to prevent the degradation<br>
of reaction kinetics in the whole battery, caused by the<br>
use of a cathode active material having a particle<br>
diameter greater than that of a currently used cathode<br>
active material, it is possible to control the loading<br>
amount of cathode active material and anode active<br>
material per unit area of each electrode.<br>
It is preferable that the loading amount of<br>
cathode active material per unit area of cathode ranges<br>
from 10 to 30 mg/cm2. When the loading amount of cathode<br>
active material is less than 10 mg/cm2, the battery may<br>
be degraded in terms of. capacity and efficiency. When<br>
the loading amount of cathode active material is greater<br>
than 30 mg/cm2, thickness of the cathode increases,<br>
resulting in degradation of reaction kinetics in the<br>
battery. Additionally, it is preferable that the loading<br>
amount of anode active material per unit area of anode<br>
ranges from 4.4 to 21 mg/cm2. When the loading amount of<br>
anode active material is less than 4.4 mg/cm2, capacity<br>
balance cannot be maintained, thereby causing<br>
degradation in battery safety. When the loading amount<br><br><br>
of anode active material is greater than 21 mg/cm2, an<br>
excessive amount of lithium sites is present undesirably<br>
in the anode, resulting in a drop in energy density per<br>
unit volume/mass of the battery.<br>
The electrode used in the battery according to the<br>
present invention can be manufactured by a conventional<br>
process known to one skilled in the art. In one<br>
embodiment, slurry for each electrode is applied onto a<br>
current collector formed of metal foil, followed by<br>
rolling and drying.<br>
Slurry for each electrode, i.e., slurry for a<br>
cathode and anode may be obtained by mixing the above-<br>
described cathode active material/anode active material<br>
with a binder and dispersion medium. Each of the slurry<br>
for a cathode and anode preferably contains a small<br>
amount of conductive agent.<br>
There is no particular limitation in the<br>
conductive agent, as long as the conductive agent is an<br>
electroconductive material that experiences no chemical<br>
change in the battery using the same. Particular<br>
examples of the conductive agent that may be used<br>
include carbon black such as acetylene black, ketchen<br>
black, furnace black or thermal black; natural graphite,<br>
artificial graphite and conductive carbon fiber, etc.,<br>
carbon black, graphite powder or carbon fiber being<br>
preferred.<br>
The binder that may be used includes thermoplastic<br>
resins, thermosetting resins or combinations thereof.<br>
Among such resins, polyvinylidene difluoride (PVdF),<br>
styrene butadiene rubber (SBR) or<br>
polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is preferable, PVdF being<br>
more preferable.<br><br><br>
The dispersion medium that may be used includes<br>
aqueous dispersion media or organic dispersion media<br>
such as N-methyl-2-pyrollidone.<br>
In both electrodes of the lithium secondary<br>
battery according to the present invention, the ratio<br>
(A/C) of the thickness of cathode (C) to that of anode<br>
(A) suitably ranges from 0.7 to 1.4, preferably from 0.8<br>
to 1.2. When the thickness ratio is less than 0.7, loss<br>
of energy density per unit volume of the battery may<br>
occur. When the thickness ratio is greater than 1.4,<br>
reaction kinetics may be slow in the whole battery.<br>
The high-voltage lithium secondary battery having<br>
charge-cutoff voltages over 4.35V or higher according to<br>
the present invention includes a cathode (C) , an anode<br>
(A) , a separator interposed between both electrodes and<br>
an electrolyte, wherein the cathode(C) and anode(A) are<br>
obtained by controlling the weight ratio (A/C) of anode<br>
active material to cathode active material per unit area<br>
of each electrode to 0.44-0.70.<br>
The high-voltage lithium secondary battery having<br>
a charge-cutoff voltage of 4.35V or higher is also<br>
characterized by using an electrolyte that further<br>
comprises a compound having a_ reaction potential of 4.7V<br>
or higher in addition to a currently used electrolyte<br>
for batteries.<br>
Due to the presence of the above characteristic<br>
electrolyte, it is possible to improve the safety and<br>
high-temperature storage characteristics of a high-<br>
voltage lithium secondary battery having a charge-cutoff<br>
voltage of 4.35V or higher.<br>
(1) When cyclohexylbenzene (CHB) or biphenyl (BP),<br>
currently used as additives for electrolyte in<br><br><br>
conventional batteries having a charge-cutoff voltage of<br>
4.2V or higher, are used in order to improve the safety<br>
and high-temperature storage characteristics of a high-<br>
voltage lithium secondary battery having a charge-cutoff<br>
voltage of 4.35V or higher, cycle characteristics of the<br>
battery at room temperature and high temperature are<br>
degraded rapidly. Additionally, because a large amount<br>
of the above additives are decomposed under high-<br>
temperature storage conditions, a very thick insulator<br>
film is formed on a cathode to prevent lithium ions from<br>
moving in the battery, so that recovery capacity of the<br>
battery cannot be obtained.<br>
On the contrary, the battery according to the<br>
present invention uses fluorotoluene (FT) compounds<br>
having a reaction potential of 4.7V or higher (for<br>
example, 2-fluorotoluene (2-FT) and/or 3-fluorotoluene<br>
(3-FT)) as additives for electrolyte. Because such<br>
additives have high reaction potentials and experience<br>
little change in reaction potentials during repeated<br>
cycles, it is possible to prevent degradation of battery<br>
quality caused by decomposition of an additive at a<br>
voltage of between 4.35V and 4.6V and a rapid change in<br>
reaction potentials, and to improve high-temperature<br>
storage characteristics of a battery.<br>
(2) When such additives for electrolyte are used,<br>
it is possible to reduce a contact surface where side<br>
reactions between a cathode and electrolyte may occur in<br>
case of the battery containing only conventional<br>
electrolyte, and thus to improve battery safety.<br>
There is no particular limitation in the additive<br>
that may be added to the electrolyte of the high-voltage<br>
lithium secondary battery having a charge-cutoff voltage<br><br><br>
of 4.35V or higher, as long as the additive is a<br>
compound having a reaction potential of 4.7V or higher.<br>
Preferably, the additive is a fluorotoluene (FT)<br>
compound. Among fluorotoluene compounds, 2-fluorotoluene<br>
(2-FT) and/or 3-fluorotoluene (3-FT) are more<br>
preferable, because they have high reaction potentials<br>
and experience little change in reaction potentials<br>
during repeated cycles.<br>
Because 2-fluorotoluene and/or 3-fluorotoluene are<br>
physically stable and have such a high boiling point as<br>
to prevent thermal decomposition as well as a high<br>
reaction potential of 4.7V or higher (the reaction<br>
potential being higher than the reaction potential of<br>
CHB or BP by about 0.1V), they can improve high-<br>
temperature storage characteristics and safety of a<br>
battery using an electrolyte comprising them as<br>
additives, contrary to conventional additives such as<br>
CHP and BP. Additionally, because they experience little<br>
change in reaction potentials during repeated cycles, as<br>
compared to conventional fluorotoluene compounds, they<br>
can prevent degradation in cycle characteristics of a<br>
high-voltage battery.<br>
In fact, when a fluorotoluene compound other than<br>
2-fluorotoluene and 3-fluorotoluene, or 4-fluorotolune<br>
(4-FT) having a reaction potential similar to that of<br>
CHB is used, a battery having a charge-cutoff voltage of<br>
4.35V or higher shows significant degradation in cycle<br>
characteristics during repeated cycles due to a reaction<br>
of a cathode active material with a fluorine atom<br>
substituted in the para-position. Therefore, it is not<br>
possible to improve the safety and high-temperature<br>
storage characteristics of a battery.<br><br><br>
Preferably, the compound having a reaction<br>
potential of 4.7V or higher (for example, 2-FT and/or 3-<br>
FT) is added to an electrolyte in an amount of between<br>
0.1 and 10 wt% based on 100 wt% of the total weight of<br>
electrolyte. When the compound is used in an amount of<br>
less than 0.1 wt%, it is not possible to improve the<br>
safety and quality of a battery significantly. When the<br>
compound is used in an amount of greater than 10 wt%,<br>
there are problems in that viscosity of the electrolyte<br>
decreases and the additive causes an exothermic reaction<br>
to emit heat excessively.<br>
The high-voltage battery having a voltage of 4.35V<br>
or higher according to the present invention can be<br>
manufactured by a conventional process known to one<br>
skilled in the art. In one embodiment, a cathode and<br>
anode are provided with a separator interposed between<br>
both electrodes and an electrolyte is introduced,<br>
wherein the cathode (C) and anode (A) are obtained by<br>
controlling the weight ratio (A/C) of anode active<br>
material to cathode active material per unit area of<br>
each electrode to 0.44-0.70.<br>
The electrolyte that may be used in the present<br>
invention includes a.salt represented by the formula of<br>
A+B~, wherein A+ represents an alkali metal cation<br>
selected from the group consisting of Li+, Na+, K+ and<br>
combinations thereof, and B" represents an anion selected<br>
from the group consisting of PF6~, BF4", CI", Br", I",<br>
C104", AsF6~, CH3C02", CF3SO3-, N(CF3S02)2", C(CF2S02)3" and<br>
combinations thereof, the salt being dissolved or<br>
dissociated in an organic solvent selected from the<br>
group consisting of propylene carbonate (PC), ethylene<br>
carbonate (EC), diethyl carbonate (DEC), dimethyl<br><br><br>
carbonate (DMC), dipropyl carbonate (DPC), dimethyl<br>
sulfoxide, acetonitrile, dimethoxyethane,<br>
diethoxyethane, tetrahydrofuran, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone<br>
(NMP), ethylmethyl carbonate (EMC), gamma-butyrolactone<br>
(y-butyrolactone) and mixtures thereof. However, the<br>
electrolyte that may be used in the present invention is<br>
not limited to the above examples. Particularly, when an<br>
electrolyte comprising a compound having a reaction<br>
potential of 4.7V or higher (for example, 2-<br>
fluorotoluene and/or 3-fluorotoluene) is used, it is<br>
possible to improve high-temperature storage<br>
characteristics and safety with no degradation in cycle<br>
characteristics of the high-voltage battery.<br>
Although there is no particular limitation in the<br>
separator that may be used in the present invention,<br>
porous separators may be used. Particular examples of<br>
porous separators include polypropylene-based,<br>
polyethylene-based and polyolefin-based porous<br>
separators.<br>
There is no particular limitation in the shape of<br>
the lithium secondary battery according to the present<br>
invention. The lithium secondary battery may be a<br>
cylindrical, prismatic, pouch-type or a coin-type<br>
battery.<br>
Additionally, according to another aspect of the<br>
present invention, there is provided a lithium secondary<br>
battery that includes a cathode, an anode, a separator<br>
and an electrolyte, wherein the battery has a charge-<br>
cutoff voltage of between 4.35V and 4.6V, and the<br>
electrolyte comprises a compound having a reaction<br>
potential of 4.7V or higher.<br>
In the lithium secondary battery, the compound<br><br><br>
having a reaction potential of 4.7V or higher is the<br>
same as defined above.<br>

Experimental Example 1. Evaluation for high-<br>
voltage battery having charge-cutoff voltages over 4.35V<br>
vs. battery having charge-cutoff voltage of 4.2V<br>
1-1. Evaluation of charge/discharge capacity<br>
The following experiment was carried out to<br>
compare the charge/discharge capacity of the lithium<br>
secondary battery having a charge-cutoff voltage of<br>
4.35V or higher according to the present invention with<br>
that of the lithium secondary battery having a charge-<br>
cutoff voltage of 4.2V.<br>
The batteries according to Examples 2-4 were used<br>
as samples for batteries having charge-cutoff voltages<br>
over 4.35V and the battery according to Comparative<br>
Example 1 was used as control (4.2V-battery) .<br>
The battery according to Example 2 was tested in a<br>
charge/discharge voltage range of between 3V and 4.35V,<br>
the battery according to Example 3 was tested in a range<br>
of between 3V and 4.4V, the battery according to Example<br>
4 was tested in a range of between 3V and 4.5V, and the<br>
battery according to Comparative Example 1 was tested in<br>
a range of between 3V and 4.2V, each battery being<br>
subjected to cycling under 1C charge/lC discharge<br>
conditions. The test were performed at room temperature<br>
(25°C/45°C) -<br>
After the experiment, the 4.2V battery according<br><br><br>
to Comparative Example 1 showed an initial charge<br>
capacity and discharge capacity of 155.0 mAh/g and 14 9.4<br>
mAh/g, respectively. The battery had an energy density<br>
per unit volume of battery of 380.0 Wh/kg (see, FIG. 2<br>
and Table 2). On the contrary, the 4.35V-battery<br>
according to Example 2 showed an initial charge capacity<br>
and discharge capacity of 179.7 mAh/g and 171.3 mAh/g,<br>
respectively, and had an energy density per unit volume<br>
of battery of 439.2 Wh/kg, resulting in improvements in<br>
terms of discharge capacity and energy density per unit<br>
volume of battery by 14.6% and 15.6%, respectively (see,<br>
FIG. 1 and Table 2). Additionally, the 4. 4V-battery and<br>
4.5V-battery according to Examples 3 and 4 showed an<br>
increase in discharge capacity of 20% and 30%,<br>
respectively, compared to the 4.2V-battery according to<br>
Comparative example 1 as control. Further, the batteries<br>
according to Examples 3 and 4 showed an increase in<br>
energy density per unit volume of 22.3% and 33.4%,<br>
respectively (see, Table 2).<br>
As can be seen from the above results, even if the<br>
lithium secondary according to the present invention<br>
uses the same cathode active material (LiCo02) that is<br>
used in a conventional battery, it increases the<br>
available capacity of LiCo02 by at least 14% and improves<br>
the energy density per unit volume significantly through<br>
the modification in the electrode design.<br><br><br><br>
1-2. Evaluation for safety<br>
The following overcharge test was performed for<br>
the lithium secondary battery having charge-cutoff<br>
voltages over 4.35V according to the present invention<br>
and the battery having a charge-cutoff voltage of 4.2V.<br>
The battery according to Example 2 was used as<br>
sample for a battery having a charge-cutoff voltage of<br>
4.35V or higher and the battery according to Comparative<br><br>
Example 1 was used as control (4.2V-battery). Each<br>
battery was subjected to the overcharge test under an<br>
overcharge voltage of 5.0V with an electric current of<br>
2A at room temperature (25°C).<br>
After the experiment, the temperature of 4.2V-<br>
battery according to Comparative Example 1 increased to<br>
200 °C after the lapse of 1 hour and exploded due to<br>
short-circuit in the battery (see, FIG. 4) . This<br>
indicates that when the conventional 4.2V-battery was<br>
overcharged to 5.0V, reactivity between the cathode and<br>
electrolyte increases to cause the decomposition of the<br>
cathode surface and oxidation of the electrolyte, and<br>
lithium dendrite growth occurs due to the lack of anode<br>
sites, into which an excessive amount of lithium ions<br>
deintercalated from the cathode upon overcharge is<br>
intercalated, resulting in a significant drop in<br>
electrochemical stability of the battery.<br>
On the contrary, when the battery having a charge-<br>
cutoff voltage of 4.35V according to the present<br>
invention was overcharged to 5.0V, the battery<br>
temperature increased to 40D. However, the temperature<br>
was stabilized with time (see, FIG. 3) . This indicates<br>
that the battery according to the present invention has<br>
a large amount of anode sites, into which an excessive<br>
amount of lithium ions deintercalated from the cathode<br>
upon overcharge can be intercalated, and shows a<br>
significant decrease in side reactions between the<br>
cathode and electrolyte due to an increased reactivity<br>
between them caused by overcharge.<br>
As can be seen from the foregoing, the lithium<br>
secondary battery according to the present invention has<br>
significantly improved overcharge safety, because it has<br><br>
a controlled weight ratio (A/C) of anode active material<br>
(A) to cathode active material (C) per unit area of each<br>
electrode, contrary to the conventional 4.2V battery.<br>
Experimental Example 2. Evaluation for cycle<br>
characteristics of high-voltage lithium secondary<br>
battery having charge-cutoff voltages over 4.35V<br>
The high-voltage lithium secondary battery having<br>
charge-cutoff voltages over 4.35V according to the<br>
present invention was evaluated for cycle<br>
characteristics as follows.<br>
The lithium secondary battery using no additive<br>
for electrolyte according to Example 1 and the lithium<br>
secondary battery using 3-fluorotoluene (3-FT) as<br>
additive for electrolyte according to Example 5 were<br>
used as samples for batteries having charge-cutoff<br>
voltages over 4.35V. As controls, the battery using CHB<br>
as additive for electrolyte according to Comparative<br>
Example 2 and the battery using 4-fluorotoluene (4-FT)<br>
as additive for electrolyte according to Comparative<br>
Example 3 were used.<br>
Each battery was tested in a charge/discharge<br>
voltage range of between 3.0V and 4.35V and was<br>
subjected to cycling under a charge/discharge current of<br>
1C (= 880 mA) . At the zone of 4.35V constant voltage,<br>
the voltage was maintained at 4.35V until the current<br>
dropped to 50 mA and the test was performed at 45°C-<br>
After the experiment, the lithium secondary<br>
battery using the electrolyte containing CHB as additive<br>
showed significant degradation in cycle characteristics<br>
under high temperature conditions, as compared to the<br>
lithium secondary battery using no additive for<br>
electrolyte according to Example 1 and the lithium<br><br>
secondary battery using the electrolyte containing 3-<br>
fluorotoluene (3-FT) as additive according to Example 5<br>
(see, FIG. 5). This indicates that because CHB having a<br>
reaction potential of less than 4.7V experiences<br>
electropolymerization to form a coating layer, charge<br>
transfer reaction of the cathode active material is<br>
inhibited and resistance is increased at the cathode,<br>
resulting in degradation in cycle characteristics of the<br>
battery. Additionally, the battery using 4-fluorotoluene<br>
having a reaction potential similar to that of CHB<br>
according to Comparative Example 3 showed a rapid drop<br>
in cycle characteristics, because the cathode active<br>
material may react with the fluorine atom present at the<br>
para-position of 4-FT during cycles under 4.35V (see,<br>
FIG. 5).<br>
On the contrary, the lithium secondary battery<br>
using 3-fluorotoluene (3-FT) having a reaction potential<br>
of higher than 4.7V as additive for electrolyte<br>
according to Example 5 did not show any significant<br>
change in high-temperature cycle characteristics, as can<br>
be seen from FIG. 5 (see, FIG. 6) .<br>
Therefore, it can be seen that the high-voltage<br>
lithium secondary battery using a compound having a<br>
reaction potential higher than 4.7 V (for example, 3-<br>
fluorotoluene (3-FT)) as additive for electrolyte<br>
according to the present invention can prevent<br>
degradation in high-temperature cycle characteristics,<br>
contrary to a 4.2V-battery using CHB as additive for<br>
electrolyte.<br>
Experimental Example 3. Evaluation for safety of<br>
high-voltage lithium secondary having charge-cutoff<br>
voltages over 4.35V<br><br><br>
The following hot box test was performed in order<br>
to evaluate the safety of the high-voltage lithium<br>
secondary having charge-cutoff voltages over 4.35V<br>
according to the present invention.<br>
The high-voltage lithium secondary battery using<br>
3-fluorotoluene as additive for electrolyte according to<br>
Example 5 was used as sample. As controls, the lithium<br>
secondary batteries using CHB and 4-fluorotoluene (4-FT)<br>
as additives for electrolyte according to Comparative<br>
Examples 2 and 3, respectively, were used.<br>
Each battery was charged to 4.4V under 1C (=880<br>
mA) for 2.5 hours and then maintained under the constant<br>
voltage condition. Then, each battery was introduced<br>
into an oven capable of convection, warmed from room<br>
temperature to a high temperature of 15 0°C at a rate of<br>
5°C/min., and exposed to such high-temperature condition<br>
for 1 hour. Additionally, each battery was checked for<br>
explosion.<br>
After the experiment, the batteries using CHB and<br>
4-FT as additive for electrolyte, respectively,<br>
according to Comparative Example 2 and Comparative<br>
Example 3 exploded with time (see, FIGs. 7 and 8). On<br>
the contrary, the lithium secondary battery using 3-<br>
fluorotoluene as additive for electrolyte according to<br>
Example 5 showed a stable state even at a high<br>
temperature of 150°C (see, FIG. 9) .<br>
Experimental Example 4. Evaluation for high-<br>
temperature storage characteristics of high-voltage<br>
lithium secondary battery having charge-cutoff voltages<br>
over 4.35V<br>
The high-voltage lithium secondary battery having<br>
charge-cutoff voltages over 4.35V was evaluated in the<br><br><br>
following high-temperature storage tests.<br>
4-1. Long-term high-temperature storage test<br>
The lithium secondary battery using 3-<br>
fluorotoluene as additive for electrolyte was used as<br>
sample. As controls, the batteries using CHB and 4-FT as<br>
additives for electrolyte, respectively, according to<br>
Comparative Example 2 and Comparative Example 3 were<br>
used.<br>
Each battery was charged at a charging current of<br>
IC to 4.35V and discharged at IC to 3V to determine the<br>
initial discharge capacity. Next, each battery was<br>
recharged to 4.35V and was subjected to repeated 30<br>
cycles of 3-hour storage at 80°C/7-hour storage at 25°C.<br>
During such cycles, the thickness of each battery was<br>
measured. Then, each battery was discharged at IC to<br>
determine the residual capacity of each battery. After<br>
measuring the residual capacity, each battery was<br>
subjected to three charge/discharge cycles and measured<br>
for the recovery capacity. In order to ensure<br>
reproducibility, the above-described procedure was<br>
repeated 4 times.<br>
After the experiment, the battery comprising CHB<br>
according to Comparative Example 2 showed a significant<br>
swelling phenomenon before the fifth charge/discharge<br>
cycle (see, FIG. 10). Additionally, the battery using 4-<br>
fluorotoluene whose reaction potential is similar to<br>
that of CHB also showed a significant swelling<br>
phenomenon after approximately 10 charge/discharge<br>
cycles (see, FIG. 11) . On the contrary, the battery<br>
using 3-fluorotoluene according to Example 5 showed a<br>
significant drop in the battery swelling phenomenon<br>
(see, FIG. 10).<br><br><br>
4-2. Short-term high-temperature storage test<br>
The lithium secondary battery using no additive<br>
for electrolyte according to Example 1 and the lithium<br>
secondary battery using 3-fluorotoluene as additive for<br>
electrolyte according to Example 5 were used as samples.<br>
As controls, the batteries using CHB and 4-FT as<br>
additives for electrolyte, respectively, according to<br>
Comparative Example 2 and Comparative Example 3 were<br>
used.<br>
Each battery was charged at a charging current of<br>
IC to 4.35V and discharged at IC to 3V to determine the<br>
initial discharge capacity. Next, each battery was<br>
recharged to 4.35V and was stored at 90°C for 4 hours,<br>
during which the thickness of each battery was measured.<br>
Then, each battery was discharged at IC to determine the<br>
residual capacity of each battery. After measuring the<br>
residual capacity, each battery was subjected to' three<br>
charge/discharge cycles and measured for the recovery<br>
capacity.<br>
After the storage at 90°C for 4 hours, the battery<br>
having a charge-cutoff voltage of 4.35V or higher<br>
according to Comparative Example 2 showed a significant<br>
increase in its thickness, particularly compared to the<br>
battery using no additive for electrolyte according to<br>
Example 1 (see, FIG. 11). This indicates that the<br>
electrolyte is decomposed due to the increase in<br>
reactivity between the cathode and electrolyte to form a<br>
thick insulator film, resulting in an increase in the<br>
battery thickness. Therefore, it can be seen that a<br>
conventional additive (for example, CHB) for a 4.2V<br>
battery is . not suitable for a high-voltage battery<br>
having a charge-cutoff voltage of 4.35V or higher.<br><br><br>
On the contrary, the high-voltage lithium<br>
secondary battery having charge-cutoff voltages over<br>
4.35V and using 3-fluorotoluene as additive for<br>
electrolyte according to Example 5 did not show a<br>
swelling phenomenon even after the storage at 90°C. This<br>
indicates that the battery shows little degradation in<br>
the battery quality (see, FIG. 11).<br>
Therefore, it can be seen that a f luorotoluene<br>
compound having a reaction potential of 4.7V or higher<br>
(for example, 2-fluotoluene and 3-fluorotoluene) is<br>
suitable for an additive for electrolyte in the high-<br>
voltage battery having a charge-cutoff voltage of 4.35V<br>
or higher according to the present invention.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
As can be seen from the foregoing, the high-<br>
voltage lithium secondary battery according to the<br>
present invention satisfies capacity balance by<br>
controlling the weight ratio (A/C) of anode active<br>
material (A) to cathode active material (C) per unit<br>
area of each electrode. By doing so, it is possible to<br>
increase the available capacity of cathode active<br>
material significantly by at least 14%, as compared to<br>
the available capacity of cathode active material in a<br>
conventional battery of merely about 50%. Therefore, the<br>
battery according to the present invention can solve the<br>
problems occurring in 4.2V-batteries according to the<br>
prior art upon overcharge, and thus can provide a high-<br>
voltage lithium secondary battery having excellent<br>
safety and long service life.<br>
Further, when a fluorotoluene compound having a<br>
reaction potential of 4.7V or higher is used as additive<br><br><br>
for electrolyte in a high-voltage battery having a<br>
charge-cutoff voltage of 4.35V or higher, it is possible<br>
to improve the safety and high-temperature storage<br>
characteristics of the battery with no degradation in<br>
cycle characteristics.<br>
While this invention has been described in<br>
connection with what is presently considered to be the<br>
most practical and preferred embodiment, it is to be<br>
understood that the invention is not limited to the<br>
disclosed embodiment and the drawings. On the contrary,<br>
it is intended to cover various modifications and<br>
variations within the spirit and scope of the appended<br>
