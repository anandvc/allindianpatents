				<td>Connector, Connector Assembly And Connection Method<br>
The present invention relates to a connector, to a connector assembly and to a connection method therefor.<br>
There has been conventionally known a connector provided with a connection detecting function. For example, a connector disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2004-63090 is such that a female housing is provided with a lock arm and a detecting member is mounted on this lock arm. The detecting member is movable between a standby position and a detection position with respect to the female housing, held at the standby position by movement preventing means in the process of connecting the housing with a mating housing and freed from the movement preventing means to permit a movement to the detection position as the housing is properly connected with the mating housing. Accordingly, the connected state of the two housings can be detected based on whether or not the detecting member can be moved.<br>
In the above case, the arrival of the detecting member at the detection position is confirmed by seeing the position of the detecting member or hearing a locking sound given by the detecting member at the detection position. However, there are cases where the position of the detecting member cannot be clearly confirmed or the locking sound cannot be heard by being drowned out by noise at an operation site. Thus, there is a likelihood of forgetting to move the detecting member and, hence, impairing the connection detecting function of the connector.<br>
Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2006-253073 discloses a connector provided with a connection detecting function. This connector is provided with a first housing including a lock projection, a second housing connectable with the first housing and including a lock arm, a connection detecting member provided in the second housing and slidable between an initial position and a detection position in directions substantially parallel to a connecting direction of the two housings, and a cantilever-shaped resilient piece extending in a direction toward the detection position from the connection detecting member.<br>
With the connection detecting member located at the initial position, the resilient piece is in contact with the lock arm in such a manner as to prevent a sliding movement of the connection detecting member to the detection position and engaged with the lock arm so as to be displaceable together with the lock arm. In the process of connecting the housings, the lock arm is resiliently deformed in a direction intersecting with the connecting direction of the two housings by interference with the lock projection. When the two housings are properly connected, the lock arm passes the lock projection and is resiliently restored to be engaged with the lock projection to prevent the separation of the two housings, and the resilient piece is disengaged from the lock arm by interference with the lock projection. Thus, a sliding movement of the connection detecting member to the detection position is permitted.<br>
In the above connector, if an external force is exerted to the connection detecting member to move it toward the detection position in a state where the two housings are not connected yet, the resilient piece is resiliently deformed to curve an area between a base end thereof and a locking portion to be engaged<br>
with the lock arm. At this time, if the resilient piece is excessively resiliently deformed, it is disengaged from the lock arm due to its resilient restoring force, with the result that the connection detecting member is slid to the detection position despite the fact that the both housings are not connected yet.<br>
The present invention was developed in view of the above situation and an object thereof is to improve overall operability of a connection function.<br>
This object is solved according to the invention by the features of the independent claims. Preferred embodiments of the invention are subject of the dependent claims.<br>
According to the invention, there is provided a connector, comprising:<br>
a housing connectable with a mating housing, the housing including at least one lock arm,<br>
at least one connection detecting member provided in or on the housing and slidable between an initial position and a detection position in directions substantially parallel to a connecting direction of the housing with the mating housing, and<br>
a resilient piece extending from the connection detecting member in a direction toward the detection position,<br>
wherein:<br>
the resilient piece is in contact with the lock arm to prevent a sliding movement of the connection detecting member to the detection position and engaged with the lock arm so as to be displaceable together with the lock arm in a state where the connection detecting member is located at the initial position,<br>
the lock arm is resiliently deformed in a direction intersecting with the connecting direction of the two housings by interference with a lock projection of<br>
the mating housing in a connecting process of the housing with the mating housing,<br>
when the two housings are properly connected, the lock arm passes the lock projection and is resiliently at least partly restored to be engaged with the lock projection in such a manner as to prevent the separation of the two housings, and the resilient piece is disengaged from the lock arm by interference with the lock projection , whereby the movement of the connection detecting member to the detection position is permitted.<br>
Accordingly, a connection detecting member is prevented from moving from an initial position to a detection position in a state where two housings are not connected yet, thereby improving overall operability.<br>
If an external force is exerted to the connection detecting member to move it toward the detection position and the resilient piece is curved or bent and deformed in a state where the two housings are not connected yet, the resilient piece comes into contact with the restricting portion before being disengaged from the lock arm to prevent any further curved deformation of the resilient piece. Thus, the disengagement of the resilient piece from the lock arm due to its curved deformation can be prevented. Consequently, a movement of the connection detecting member from the initial position to the detection position can be prevented in the state where the two housings are not connected yet.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, a restricting portion is provided to prevent an excessive curved deformation of the resilient piece toward a side opposite to the lock projection with the resilient piece engaged with the lock arm in the state where the connection detecting member is located at the initial position.<br>
Preferably, the restricting portion is formed in a range corresponding to at least a lengthwise middJe part of the resilient piece out of a curvable area of the resilient piece from a base end thereof to a locking portion to be engaged with the lock arm.<br>
Out of the curvable area from the base end of the resilient piece to the locking portion to be engaged with the lock arm, the lengthwise middle part of the resilient piece is maximally displaced when the resilient piece is curved. In view of this point, the restricting portion is formed over the range corresponding to the lengthwise middle part of the resilient piece in the present invention. Therefore, an excessive curved deformation of the resilient piece can be effectively prevented.<br>
Further preferably, the restricting portion is formed in a range of an area not corresponding to an extending end of the resilient piece in the entire length of the resilient piece.<br>
In a state where the two housings are properly connected and the connection detecting member is located at the initial position, the resilient piece interfering with the lock projection inclines its posture and is displaced to approach the restricting portion. A displacement amount of the resilient piece at this time is maximal at the extending end of the resilient piece. In view of this point, the restricting portion is formed in the range excluding the extending end of the resilient piece in the present invention. Therefore, there is no likelihood of hindering the displacement of the resilient piece due to the interference of the extending end of the resilient piece with the restricting portion.<br>
Still further preferably, an arcuate or bent or tapered contact portion is formed at an end edge of the restricting portion at the same side as the extending end of the resilient piece.<br>
When the resilient piece is displaced to approach the restricting portion, the extending end of the resilient piece comes into contact with the contact portion formed at the end edge of the restricting portion at the same side as the extending end of the resilient piece. If this contact portion is angular like an edge, the contact portion and the resilient piece may be deformed. In this respect, the contact portion is arcuate or tapered in the present invention, wherefore the deformations of the contact portion and the resilient piece can be prevented.<br>
Further preferably, the restricting portion is formed integral or unitary to the connection detecting member.<br>
Since the restricting portion is formed on the connection detecting member as a formation base of the resilient piece, there is no likelihood of disrupting the positional relationship of the resilient piece and the restricting portion.<br>
Most preferably, the connection detecting member includes a pair of side walls located at the opposite sides of the resilient piece, and<br>
the restricting portion is connected with the pair of side walls, preferably with edge portions thereof, at an angle different from 0° or 180°, preferably substantially at right angles and formed to connect the pair of side walls.<br>
Since the restricting portion is connected with the edge portions of the pair of side walls substantially at right angles and formed to connect this pair of side walls, the deflection strength of the restricting portion is higher as compared with the case where the restricting portion in the form of a single plate singly extends. Therefore, the curved deformation of the resilient piece can be reliably restricted.<br>
According to the invention, there is further provided a connector assembly comprising a connector according to the invention or a preferred embodiment thereof and a mating connector connectable therewith.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, there is provided a connector assembly, comprising:<br>
a first housing including a lock projection,<br>
a second housing connectable with the first housing and including a lock arm,<br>
a connection detecting member provided in the second housing and slidable between an initial position and a detection position in directions substantially parallel to a connecting direction of the two housings, and<br>
a cantilever-shaped resilient piece extending from the connection detecting member in a direction toward the detection position,<br>
wherein:<br>
the resilient piece is in contact with the lock arm to prevent a sliding movement of the connection detecting member to the detection position and engaged with the lock arm so as to be displaceable together with the lock arm in a state where the connection detecting member is located at the initial position,<br>
the lock arm is resiliently deformed in a direction intersecting with the connecting direction of the two housings by interference with the lock projection in a connecting process of the two housings,<br>
when the two housings are properly connected, the lock arm passes the lock projection and is resiliently restored to be engaged with the lock projection in such a manner as to prevent the separation of the two housings, and the resilient piece is disengaged from the lock arm by interference with the lock projection,<br>
whereby the sliding movement of the connection detecting member to the detection position is permitted, and<br>
a restricting portion is provided to prevent an excessive curved deformation of the resilient piece toward a side opposite to the lock projection with the resilient piece engaged with the lock arm in the state where the connection detecting member is located at the initial position.<br>
If an external force is exerted to the connection detecting member to move it toward the detection position and the resilient piece is curved and deformed in a state where the two housings are not connected yet, the resilient piece comes into contact with the restricting portion before being disengaged from the lock arm to prevent any further curved deformation of the resilient piece. Thus, the disengagement of the resilient piece from the lock arm due to its curved deformation can be prevented. Consequently, a movement of the connection detecting member from the initial position to the detection position can be prevented in the state where the two housings are not connected yet.<br>
Preferably, the restricting portion is formed in a range corresponding to at least a lengthwise middle part of the resilient piece out of a curvable area of the resilient piece from a base end thereof to a locking portion to be engaged with the lock arm.<br>
Out of the curvable area from the base end of the resilient piece to the locking portion to be engaged with the lock arm, the lengthwise middle part of the resilient piece is maximally displaced when the resilient piece is curved. In view of this point, the restricting portion is formed over the range corresponding to the lengthwise middle part of the resilient piece in the present invention. Therefore,<br>
an excessive curved deformation of the resilient piece can be effectively prevented<br>
Further preferably, the restricting portion is formed in a range of an area not corresponding to an extending end of the resilient piece in the entire length of the resilient piece.<br>
In a state where the two housings are properly connected and the connection detecting member is located at the initial position, the resilient piece interfering with the lock projection inclines its posture and is displaced to approach the restricting portion. A displacement amount of the resilient piece at this time is maximal at the extending end of the resilient piece. In view of this point, the restricting portion is formed in the range excluding the extending end of the resilient piece in the present invention. Therefore, there is no likelihood of hindering the displacement of the resilient piece due to the interference of the extending end of the resilient piece with the restricting portion.<br>
Still further preferably, an arcuate or tapered contact portion is formed at an end edge of the restricting portion at the same side as the extending end of the resilient piece.<br>
When the resilient piece is displaced to approach the restricting portion, the extending end of the resilient piece comes into contact with the contact portion formed at the end edge of the restricting portion at the same side as the extending end of the resilient piece. If this contact portion is angular like an edge, the contact portion and the resilient piece may be deformed. In this respect, the contact portion is arcuate or tapered in the present invention, wherefore the deformations of the contact portion and the resilient piece can be prevented.<br>
Further preferably, the restricting portion is formed integral to the connection detectting mefnber.<br>
Since the restricting portion is formed on the connection detecting member as a formation base of the resilient piece, there is no likelihood of disrupting the positional relationship of the resilient piece and the restricting portion.<br>
Most preferably, the connection detecting member includes a pair of side walls located at the opposite sides of the resilient piece, and<br>
the restricting portion is connected with edge portions of the pair of side walls substantially at right angles and formed to connect the pair of side walls.<br>
Since the restricting portion is connected with the edge portions of the pair of side walls substantially at right angles and formed to connect this pair of side walls, the deflection strength of the restricting portion is higher as compared with the case where the restricting portion in the form of a single plate singly extends. Therefore, the curved deformation of the resilient piece can be reliably restricted.<br>
According to the invention, there is provided a connector, in particular according to the above aspect of the invention or a preferred embodiment thereof, comprising:<br>
a housing capable of at least partly accommodating at least one terminal fitting, and<br>
at least one detecting member assembled or to be assembled with the housing in such a manner as to be movable between a standby position (first position) and a detection position (second position), permitted to move from the standby position to the detection position if the housing is properly connected with a mating housing and prevented from moving to the detection position in a state where the housing is partly connected with the mating housing,<br>
wherein the detecting member is formed with at least one opening and a background color seen or detected through the opening differs when the detecting member is positioned at the standby position and at the detection position.<br>
Since the background color seen or detected through the opening is different from that at the standby position when the detecting member is moved from the standby position to the detection position, the arrival of the detecting member at the detection position can be clearly confirmed. As a result, it can be prevented to forget to move or operate the detecting member. Accordingly, the reliability of a connection detecting function of a connector is improved.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, a corresponding part of the detecting member is or can be seen or detected through the opening when the detecting member is positioned at the standby position and a corresponding part of the housing is or can be seen or detected through the opening when the detecting member is positioned at the detection position.<br>
Since the corresponding part of the detecting member is seen or detected through the opening at the standby position, the color in the opening and that of a part surrounding opening can be the same at the standby position. Thus, an operator can know the arrival of the detecting member at the detection position by the fact that the background color seen or detected through the opening became a color different from that of the surrounding part, and needs not remember the background colors. Therefore, there is a smaller possibility of erroneous confirmation.<br>
Preferably, the housing includes a lock arm for holding a connected state with the mating housing, and<br>
a corresponding part of the lock arm is or can be seen or detected through the opering when the detecting member is positioned at the detection position.<br>
Since the corresponding part of the lock arm is seen through the opening at the detection position, the condition of the corresponding part of the lock arm can also be confirmed.<br>
Most preferably, the detecting member is in a first color and the housing is in a second color different from the first color.<br>
Since the detecting member is in the first color and the housing is in the<br>
second color, it is not necessary to color-separate only the corresponding parts<br>
seen through the opening from the surrounding part, wherefore production is<br>
easier.	According to the invention, there is further provided a connector<br>
assembly comprising a connector according to the invention or a preferred embodiment thereof and a mating connector connectable therewith.<br>
According to the invention, there is further provided a method of connecting a connector, in particular according to the invention or a preferred embodiment thereof, with a mating connector, comprising the steps of:<br>
providing a housing capable of at least partly accommodating at least one terminal fitting,<br>
providing a mating housing,<br>
assembling at least one detecting member with the housing in such a manner as to be movable between a standby position and a detection position, permitted to move from the standby position to the detection position if the housing is properly connected with a mating housing and prevented from moving to the detection position in a state where the housing is partly connected with the mating housing,<br>
after connection of the housing and the mating housing verifying the connection by confirming a background color which can he seen or detected through at least one opening formed in the detecting member, wherein the background color which can be seen or detected through the opening differs when the detecting member is positioned at the standby position and at the detection position.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, a corresponding part of the detecting member is seen or detected through the opening when the detecting member is positioned at the standby position and a corresponding part of the housing is seen or detected through the opening when the detecting member is positioned at the detection position.<br>
Preferably, the method further comprises a step of holding a connected state with the mating housing by means of at least one lock arm,<br>
wherein a corresponding part of the lock arm is seen through the opening when the detecting member is positioned at the detection position.<br>

A first preferred embodiment of the present invention is described with reference to FIGS. 1 to 10. A connector of this embodiment is provided with a housing 10, one or more female terminal fittings 40 and a detecting member 60, wherein the housing 10 is connectable with a mating housing 90 and the detecting member 60 is movable between a standby position SP (or first position) and a detection position DP (or second position) with respect to the housing 10. In the following description, sides of the two housings 10, 90 to be connected are referred to as front sides concerning forward and backward directions.<br>
The male housing 90 is made e.g. of synthetic resin and includes a terminal accommodating portion 91 capable of at least partly accommodating one or more male terminal fittings 50 and a tubular receptacle 92 projecting forward on or from (preferably the front surface of) the terminal accommodating portion 91. One or more cavities 93 capable of at least partly accommodating the respective male terminal fittings 50 are formed in the terminal accommodating portion 91. In the receptacle 92, one or more tabs 51 of the respective male<br>
terminal fittings 50 are arranged to project substantially forward from the front surface of the cavities 93, and a releasing piece 94 projects forward from the back wall of the receptacle 92. A lock portion 95 projects on or from the lateral (upper) surface of the receptacle 92. A retainer 96 for retaining the one or more male terminal fittings 50 is to be at least partly mounted in the terminal accommodating portion 91. This retainer 96 includes one or more terminal locking portions 97 for locking respective portions (preferably box portions) 52 of the male terminal fittings 50, and (preferably substantially sawtooth-shaped or pointed) projections 98 for biting in or engaging the insulation coatings of wires 55 connected with the male terminal fittings 50. The male terminal fittings 50 are primarily retained in the cavities 93 by the engagement of locking lances 54 formed in the (box) portions 52 preferably by cutting and bending with the inner walls of the cavities 94. Alternatively or additionally, the male terminal fittings 50 may be retained in the respective cavities 93 by locking portions (not shown) provided therein or thereon.<br>
The housing 10 is made e.g. of synthetic resin and includes a housing main body 11 (preferably substantially in the form of a flat block), at least one lock arm 12 provided at or on the lateral (upper) surface of the housing main body 11 and a fitting portion 13 at least partly surrounding the housing main body 11 as shown in FIG. 9. One or more, e.g. three cavities 14 capable of at least partly accommodating the one or more respective female terminal fittings 40 are arranged in a row in the housing main body 11, preferably laterally in a row in the housing main body 11. As shown in FIG. 10, one or more, preferably a pair of lateral (left and/or right) receiving portions 15 for detection project from the rear end of the housing main body 11.  Further,  a communication space 16<br>
communicating with the outer or lateral (upper) surface of the housing main body 11 and the one or more respective cavities 14 penetrates (preferably a rear end portion of) the housing main body 11, and a wire holding member 17 is or can be at least partly fitted or inserted in this communication space 16. As shown in FIG. 1, the wire holding member 17 includes (preferably substantially sawtooth-shaped or pointed) projections 18 for biting in or engaging the insulation coatings of wires 41, and movements of the wires 41 substantially in forward and backward directions are restricted by this biting or engaging action of the projections 18.<br>
An accommodating chamber 19 for a shorting terminal 42 is so formed in (preferably the front surface of) the housing main body 11 as to communicate at least with two cavities 14 adjacent to each other. The accommodating chamber 19 preferably also makes an opening in a side surface of the fitting portion 13, and the shorting terminal 42 can be mounted through this opening in the side surface. The shorting terminal 42 comes or can come into contact with the respective female terminal fittings 40 at least partly accommodated in the at least two cavities 14 laterally or from below to short the two or more terminal fittings 40 (see FIG. 1) preferably until a connecting operation of the two housings 10, 90 is completed. With the two housings 10, 90 properly connected, the shorting terminal 42 preferably is pressed down (or away from the two or more terminal fittings 40) by the releasing piece 94 of the receptacle 92 to release the two or more terminal fittings 40 from the shorted state (see FIG. 3).<br>
The lock arm 12 is comprised of one or more, preferably a pair of lateral (left and/or right) leg portions 21 standing up from or projecting on the outer (upper) surface of the housing main body 11, one or more, preferably a pair of<br>
lateral (left and/or right) arm portions 22 extending (preferably both) substantially forward and/or backward from the upper ends of the (preferably both) leg portion(s) 21, a lower plate 23 preferably coupling the bottom end edges of the both arm portions 22, an upper plate 24 (preferably substantially in the form of a rectangular plate) preferably coupling the upper end edges of the both arms 22 and a lock main body 25 preferably coupling the front ends of the arm portions 22, and is pivotally displaceable (resiliently displaceable) upward and downward (or in a direction intersecting a connecting direction of the two connector housings 10, 90) like a seesaw with the (preferably both) leg portion(s) 21 as supporting point(s). A formation area of the lower plate 23 in forward and backward directions preferably is a range from a position behind the lock main body 25 to the rear ends of the lock portions 22, and the outer or upper plate 24 is arranged at the rear ends of the arm portions 22. Both the outer or upper plate 24 and the inner or lower plate 23 preferably are thin plates and substantially horizontally arranged in different levels or radial positions. A mount space 26, into which a detecting main body 64 (to be described later) of the detecting member 60 is at least partly insertable, is defined between the upper plate 24 and the lower plate 23 and between the two arm portions 22.<br>
One or more, preferably a pair of lateral (left and/or right) guide ribs 27 extending substantially in forward and backward directions (lengthwise direction of the lock arm 12 in a free state) are provided to project at or near the (preferably substantially opposite) lateral edge(s) of the arm portions 22, and one or more, preferably a pair of lateral (left and/or right) retaining projections 28 are provided to project at the (preferably substantially opposite) lateral edge(s) of the lower<br>
surface(s). The lower surface(s) of the guide rib(s) 27 and the upper surface(s) of the retaining projection(s) 28 is/are integrally or unitarily connected.<br>
The fitting portion 13 includes one or more, preferably a pair of lateral (left and/or right) side walls 31 standing up or projecting on or at the (preferably substantially opposite) side(s) of the lock arm 12. The fitting portion 13 preferably also includes a coupling wall 32 coupling the front ends of the upper edges of the opposite side walls 31.<br>
The outer surfaces of the housing 10 including the lock arm 12 preferably are entirely in a second color, specifically in a bright color such as yellow, and the entire external appearance thereof is seen uniformly in the bright color such as yellow before the detecting member 60 is assembled.<br>
Each female terminal fitting 40 substantially is narrow and long in forward and backward directions, wherein a front portion (preferably a substantially front half thereof) serves as a (preferably substantially tubular or box-shaped) connecting portion 43 and a rear portion (preferably a substantially rear half thereof) serves as a wire connection portion (preferably comprising a wire crimping portion 44 in the form of at least one open barrel). A locking lance 45 is formed in or on the connecting portion 43 preferably by cutting and bending. The female terminal fitting 40 at least partly inserted into the cavity 14 from an insertion side, preferably substantially from behind, is retained in the cavity 14 by the resilient engagement of the locking lance 45 with the inner wall of the cavity 14. Alternatively or additionally, the female terminal fitting 40 may be retained in the cavity 14 by a locking portion provided therein or thereon.<br>
The detecting member 60 is made e.g. of synthetic resin and includes a (preferably substantially block-shaped) operable portion 61 located at or near the<br>
rear end, one or more, preferably a pair of lateral (left and/or right) cantriever-shaped guide arms 62 extending substantially forward from the (preferably substantially opposite) end(s) of the operable portion 61, a covering portion 63 coupling the upper end edges of the (preferably both) guide arm(s) 62 and a cantilever-shaped detecting main body 64 located below or inward of the covering portion 63 and adjacent to guide arm(s) 62 (or preferably between the two guide arms 62) and extending substantially forward from the operable portion 61 as shown in FIG. 8. As shown in FIG. 7, one or more guide grooves 65 are so formed in the inner surface(s) of the (preferably both) guide arm(s) 62 as to extend in forward and backward directions. The guide grooves 65 are arranged such that openings thereof are faced inwardly. One or more, preferably a pair of lateral (left and/or right) retaining projections 66 are provided on the inner surfaces of the (preferably both) guide arm(s) 62 below the guide groove(s) 65.<br>
As shown in FIG. 4, the covering portion 63 preferably substantially is in the form of a flat plate at least partly covering a portion (preferably substantially the rear half) of the housing main body 11 and includes one or more, preferably a pair of lateral (left and/or right) contact pieces 67 projecting forward from the front end edge thereof. One or more, preferably a pair of lateral (left and/or right) through holes 68 are formed at positions near the (preferably substantially opposite) lateral edge(s) of the covering portion 63. The (preferably both) through hole(s) 68 of the covering portion 63 preferably substantially are rectangular holes longer or elongate in forward and backward directions, and the corresponding retaining projection(s) 66 can be seen through the (preferably both) through hole(s) 68 in an isolated state before being assembled. The covering portion 63 is also formed with a (preferably single) window portion 69<br>
(corresponding to a preferred "opening") at a widthwise intermediate position (preferably substantially a widthwise center position) near the rear end edge- The window portion 69 of the covering portion 63 preferably is a loop hole, specifically a round hole. When the detecting member 60 is in a state before being assembled or in a standby state (standby position SP), a part of the detecting member 60, specifically, the upper surface of the detecting main body 64 can be seen through the window portion 69. When the detecting member 60 is at the detection position DP, a part of the housing 10, specifically the upper surface of the upper plate 24 can be seen through the window portion 69.<br>
The detecting main body 64 preferably substantially is in the form of a plate narrow and long in forward and backward directions and is resiliently deformable upward and downward, and a contact projection 71 projecting downward or inwardly is provided at or near the front end thereof. A front end portion of the detecting main body 64 is made thinner than a base end portion thereof connected with the operable portion 61, thereby enabling smooth deformations of the front end portion and/or increasing the strength of the base end portion. The bottom end of the operable portion 61 is located slightly below the lower surface of the detecting main body 64, and the front end edge of the bottom end of the operable portion 61 constitutes one or more connection detecting portions 72.<br>
The outer surfaces of the detecting member 60 preferably are entirely in a first color different from the second color, specifically in a darker color such as blue, so that the entire external appearance thereof is seen uniformly in the first color (blue) before being assembled with the lock arm 12.<br>
Such a detecting member 60 is assembled with the lock arm 12 (meaning the same as "with the housing 10") preferably substantially from behind, and the detecting main body 64 at least partly enters the mount space 26 as the detecting member 60 is assembled. In this assembling process, the one or more guide ribs 27 and the one or more guide grooves 65 are engaged, whereby the detecting member 60 is slid forward with respect to the lock arm 12 and the guide arms 62 are resiliently deformed outwardly substantially in width direction by the interference of the retaining projections 28, 66. Thereafter, when the detecting member 60 is assembled at the standby position SP with respect to the lock arm 12, the retaining projections 66 of the detecting member 60 are engaged with the retaining projections 28 of the lock arm 12 from front, thereby retaining the detecting member 60, and/or the contact projection 71 is engaged with the lock main body 25 from behind, thereby preventing the detecting member 60 from moving any further forward. By these engaging actions, the detecting member 60 is held or located at the standby position SP. At this time, the detecting main body 64 is held between the upper plate 24 and the lower plate 23 and/or at least partly between the left and right arm portions 22, and the upper plate 24 is held at least partly between the detecting main body 64 and the covering portion 63, whereby the detecting member 60 is united with the lock arm 12 to preferably be displaceable substantially like a seesaw. A space between the lower surface of the covering portion 63 and the upper surface of the detecting main body 64 serves as a sliding space 39 for the upper plate 24, and a dimension thereof preferably is set substantially equal to or slightly larger than the thickness of the upper plate 24. When the operable portion 61 is pressed down, the lock arm 12 and the detecting member 60 can be displaced in unlocking direction.<br>
Next, functions of this embodiment are described.<br>
The detecting member 60 is held or positioned at the standby position SP with respect to the lock arm 12. In this state, as shown in FIGS. 1 and 4, the operable portion 61 projects more backward than the rear surface of the housing main body 11 and the upper surfaces of the arm portions 22 are or can be seen or detected through the through holes 68 and the upper surface of the detecting main body 64 is or can be seen or detected through the window portion 69 when the detecting member 60 is viewed from above. Since the detecting member 60 is entirely in the first color (preferably blue), a background color seen through the window portion 69 preferably is the same first color (blue) as a peripheral part of the window portion 69 in this case. On the other hand, a background color seen through the through holes 68 is the second color (preferably yellow) as the color of the housing main body 11 and remains the second color (yellow) even when the detecting member 60 is successively moved.<br>
When the housing 10 is connected with the mating housing 90, the receptacle 92 of the mating housing 90 is at least partly inserted between the housing main body 11 and the fitting portion 13. In this connecting process, the lock main body 25 of the lock arm 12 moves onto the lock portion 95 of the mating housing 90 as shown in FIG. 2, whereby the lock arm 12 and the detecting member 60 are displaced to extend obliquely upward or outward toward the front and the connection detecting portions 72 of the detecting member 60 are displaced inwardly or downwardly to face the receiving portions 15 for detection of the housing main body 11 from behind. Here, if the connecting operation of the two housings 10, 90 should be finished in an incomplete way (e.g. halfway), even if an attempt is made to move the detecting member 60 toward the detection<br>
position DP (preferably forward), the connection detecting portions 72 come into contact with the receiving portions 15 for detection to prevent a forward movement of the detecting member 60. Since the contact projection 71 is kept engaged with the lock main body 25, the forward movement of the detecting member 60 is (preferably also) prevented by this.<br>
When the two housings 10, 90 are properly connected, the lock main body 25 passes the lock portion 95, whereby the lock arm 12 returns towards or to its free state by its resilient restoring force to engage the lock main body 25 with the lock portion 95. By this engaging action, the two housings 10, 90 are inseparably held. At this time, the lower surface of the contact projection 71 is substantially in contact with the upper surface of the lock portion 95, whereby the detecting main body 64 is resiliently deformed upwardly or outwardly relative to the lock arm 12. Further, the operable portion 61 of the detecting member 60 is displaced upwardly or outwardly together with the lock arm 12, thereby disengaging the connection detecting portions 72 from the receiving portions 15 for detection. As a result, the contact projection 71 and the lock main body 25 are disengaged to permit a movement of the detecting member 60 towards or to the detection position DP. In this state, the background color seen through the window portion 69 remains the second color (yellow) since the position of the detecting member 60 relative to the lock arm 12 continues to be the standby position SP.<br>
Thereafter, the detecting member 60 is slid or moved toward the detection position DP with respect to the lock arm 12. In this sliding or moving process, the contact projection 71 passes the lock portion 95 and the lock main body 25, whereby the detecting main body 64 is resiliently at least partly restored. As this (sliding) movement ends, the contact projection 71 is engaged with the lock main<br>
body 25 from front as shown in FIG. 6. Then, the front end(s) of the (both) contact piece(s) 67 come(s) into contact with the coupling wall 32 from behind to prevent any further forward movement of the detecting member 60. In this way, the detecting member 60 is held at the detection position DP while preferably being prevented from moving forward and backward with respect to the lock arm 12 as shown in FIGS. 3 and 5. Further, front end portion(s) of the (both) guide arm(s) 62 slip(s) under the coupling wall 32 to come into contact with the lower surface of the coupling wall 32, whereby an upward (unlocking direction) displacement of the detecting member 60 and therefore the lock arm 12 is prevented. Thus, the lock main body 25 and the lock portion 95 are reliably kept engaged to doubly lock the two housings 10, 90. The rear end of the detecting member 60 at the detection position DP and the rear end of the housing main body 11 preferably are aligned substantially at the same position in forward and backward directions.<br>
In the moving process of the detecting member 60 from the standby position SP to the detection position DP, the upper plate 24 of the lock arm 12 is relatively displaced backward with respect to the detecting member 60 in the sliding space 39 between the detecting main body 64 and the covering portion 63 and gradually appears in the window portion 69 preferably immediately before the detecting member 60 reaches the detection position DP. As the detecting member 60 reaches the detection position DP, the upper plate 24 comes to appear in the entire window portion 69. Accordingly, if an operator looks inside the window portion 69 in this state, the second color (yellow color) of the upper plate 24 (housing 10) can be seen through the window portion 69.<br>
On the other hand, if the detecting member 60 is kept at the standby position SP, the upper plate 24 is located before the window portion 69 and does<br>
not correspond to the window portion 69, wherefore only the upper surface of the detecting main body 64 can be seen through the window portion 69 via the sliding space 39 and the background color seen through the window portion 69 is the same first color (blue color) as the peripheral part of the window portion 69. Accordingly, it can be judged that the detecting member 60 has not been moved if there is no change in the background color seen through the window portion 69 and, in this case, the detecting member 60 is pushed to the detection position DP anew.<br>
As described above, this embodiment has the following effects.<br>
When the detecting member 60 is moved from the standby position SP to the detection position DP, the background color seen through the window portion 69 is a different color than the one seen at the standby position SP, wherefore the arrival of the detecting member 60 at the detection position DP can be (preferably visually) clearly detected. As a result, it can be prevented to forget to move the detecting member 60, thereby being able to improve the reliability of the connection detecting function of the connector.<br>
In this case, since the detecting member 60 itself is seen through the window portion 69 at the standby position SP, the color in the window portion 69 (color of the upper surface of the detecting main body 64) and the color outside the window portion 69 (color of the upper surface of the covering portion 63) can be the same color (e.g. blue color). Thus, the operator needs not remember the background colors seen through the window portion 69 at the standby position SP and the detection position DP and can judge the arrival of the detecting member 60 at the detection position DP by the fact that the color (yellow in this embodiment) different from that of the peripheral part of the window portion 69<br>
has appeared in the window portion 69. Therefore, an erroneously confirming possibility of the operator decreases and the reliability of the connection detecting function can be further improved.<br>
Since the detecting main body 64 of the lock arm 12 is seen through the window portion 69 at the detection position DP, a condition such as a defective state of the detecting main body 64 can also be confirmed, wherefore the quality of the lock arm 12 can also be improved.<br>
Further, since the detecting member 60 preferably is entirely in the first color (blue) and the housing 10 preferably is entirely in the second color (yellow) different from the first color, it is not necessary to color-separate the upper plate 24 and the detecting main body 64 from surrounding parts, wherefore production is easier.<br>
Since the window portion 69 is located at the easily detectable or seeable position of the detecting member 60 in the widthwise intermediate part (preferably substantially central part) of the outer or upper surface of the connector and near the operable portion 61 and has an easily seeable shape (looped opening), the visibility thereof is good.<br>
Accordingly, to improve the reliability of a connection detecting function of a connector, a detecting member 60 is so assembled with a lock arm 12 of a housing 10 as to be movable between a standby position SP and a detection position DP. The detecting member 60 is permitted to move from the standby position SP to the detection position DP when the housing 10 is properly connected with a mating housing 90, and a movement thereof to the detection position DP is prevented in a state where the housing 10 is partly connected with the mating housing 90. The detecting member 60 is formed with at least one<br>
window portion 69. A detecting main body 64 of the detecting member 60 is at<br>
least partly seen or delectable through the window portion 69 at the standby<br>
position SP, whereas an upper plate 24 of the lock arm 12 is at least partly seen<br>
or detectable therethrough at the detection position DP. The detecting member<br>
60 is in a first color and the housing is in a second color different from the first<br>
color.<br><br>
The present invention is not limited to the above described and illustrated embodiment. For example, the following embodiments are also embraced by the technical scope of the present invention.<br>
(1)	It is sufficient that the background colors seen through the window portion are different at the standby position and at the detection position, and they can be any colors. Each background color may not necessarily be limited to a single color and may be a combination of colors. Of course, it is preferable to combine such colors that a color difference chromatically stands out between the standby position and the detection position.<br>
(2)	The background other than the detecting main body may be seen through the window portion at the standby position, and the background other than the upper plate may be seen through window portion at the detection position.<br>
(3)	The detecting member may be mounted on a movable part of the housing other than the lock arm (such as a lever in a lever-type connector).<br>
(4)	The window portion may not be a closed loop hole and may be formed by making a cutout at an end edge of the detecting member.<br>
(5)	A plurality of window portions may be formed in the detecting member.<br>
(6)	A transparent or semitransparent filter may be mounted to cover the window portion. This can prevent external matters such as dusts from entering the window portion.<br><second embodiment></second>
A second preferred embodiment of the present invention is described with reference to FIGS. 11 to 21. A connector of this embodiment is provided with a first housing 110 having one or more male terminal fittings 111 at least partly mounted therein and a second housing 120 having one or more female terminal fittings 121 at least partly mounted therein. It should be noted that, in the following description, forward and backward directions are the same directions as those parallel to a connecting direction of the two housings 110, 120 and a sliding or movement direction of a connection detecting member 133 to be described later from an initial position to a detection position.<br>
The first housing 110 is made e.g. of synthetic resin and includes a tubular receptacle 112 projecting forward (substantially same direction as the connecting direction with the second housing 120). A lock projection 113 is formed to project from the lateral (upper) surface (outer surface) of the lateral (upper) wall of the receptacle 112.<br>
The second housing 120 is made e.g. of synthetic resin and is an integral or unitary assembly of a block-shaped terminal holding portion 122 and a tubular fitting portion 123 (preferably substantially in the form of a rectangular tube) at least partly surrounding a front portion (preferably a substantially a front half area) of the terminal holding portion 122, wherein the female terminal fittings 121<br>
are to be at least partly accommodated in the terminal holding portion 122. A lock arm 124 extending substantially in forward and backward directions is integrally or unitarily formed on the lateral (upper) surface (outer surface) of the terminal holding portion 122. The lock arm 124 is an integral or unitary assembly of one or more, preferably a pair of lateral (left and/or right) arm portions 125 extending substantially in forward and backward directions, a lock portion 126 provided on the arm portion 125, preferably connecting the front ends of the both arm portions 125, a (preferably substantially plate-like) coupling portion 127 coupling the rear ends of the both arm portions 125, one or more, preferably a pair of leg portions 128 projecting from (preferably substantially central positions of) the lower or inner surfaces of the both arm portions 125, and a lower plate 129 coupling the bottom end edges of the both arm portions 125 and is supported on the terminal holding portion 122 at the leg portions 128. Such a lock arm 124 is in a locking posture where the both arms 125 are extending substantially in forward and backward directions (directions substantially parallel to connecting and separating directions of the two housings 110, 120) in a free state where the lock arm is not resiliently displaced, and is resiliently displaceable substantially like a seesaw to an unlocking posture reached by displacing a front end side thereof upward or outward (direction at an angle different from 0° or 180°, preferably substantially orthogonal to forward and backward directions) with the leg portions<br>
128	substantially as supporting points. One or more guide ribs 130 extending substantially in the lengthwise direction of the arm portions 125 are formed at or near the outer lateral edges of the arm portions 125, and one or more stoppers 131 are formed on the lower surfaces of the both guide ribs 130. The lower plate<br>
129	preferably is formed to extend from the rear ends of the arm portions 125 to a<br>
position slightly behind the front ends (lock portion 126) of the arm portions 125. There is an open space between the front end edge of the lower plate 129 and the lock portion 126, into which space the lock projection 113 is at least partly fittable or insertable. An upper wall 123A of the tubular fitting portion 123 is formed with an opening 123B preferably by cutting away an area thereof excluding the opposite left and/or right edge portions and a front end edge portion, and the lock arm 124 is exposed upward through this opening 123B.<br>
A connection detecting member 133 made e.g. of synthetic resin is mounted in the second housing 120. The connection detecting member 133 preferably is an integral or unitary assembly of a pair of left and right narrow and long side walls 134 extending substantially in forward and backward directions, an operable portion 135 coupling the rear ends of the both side walls 134, a bar-shaped supporting portion 136 projecting forward (in parallel with the side walls 134) in a space between the opposite side walls 134, a resilient piece 137 extending further forward (direction extending from the initial position toward the detection position) from the front end (extending end) of the supporting portion 136 and a (preferably substantially plate-like) restricting portion 138 coupling the upper edges of the both side walls 134.<br>
One or more guide grooves 139 substantially parallel to the lengthwise direction of the side walls 134 are formed in the inner side surface(s) of the (preferably both) side wall(s) 134, and one or more retaining projections 140 are formed to project inwardly from (preferably substantially central positions of) the inner side surfaces of the side walls 134 substantially in forward and backward directions. The resilient piece 137 has a smaller vertical thickness than the supporting portion 136, the upper surface of the resilient piece 137 preferably is<br>
substantially in flush with and continuous with that of the supporting portion 136, and the lowar surface of the resilient piece 137 is located above that of the supporting portion 136. A locking portion 141 to be engaged with the lock portion 126 of the lock arm 124 is formed at or near the front end of the resilient piece 137. The locking portion 141 is comprised of a projecting end 142 as the front end (extending end) of the resilient piece 137, a touching portion 143 projecting downward or inward from a position slightly behind the projecting end 142, and a cut-away portion 144 defined by or at the lower or inner surface of the projecting end 142 and the front surface of the touching portion 143. Such a resilient piece 137 is resiliently deformable to be curved upward or outward between a base end (rear end) substantially continuous with the front end of the supporting portion 136 and the locking portion 141 and resiliently displaceable so that the locking portion 141 side is displaced upward or outward with the base end substantially as a supporting point. Further, the front end of the resilient piece 137 is located behind the front ends of the side walls 134.<br>
The restricting portion 138 is connected with the upper end edges of the one or more, preferably pair of side walls 134 at an angle different from 0° or 180°, preferably substantially at right angles and formed to continuously extend substantially in forward and backward directions from the rear ends of the both side walls 134 (front end of the operable portion 135) to a position slightly behind the front ends of the side walls 134. The front end position of the restricting portion 138 is located slightly behind the front end (projecting end 142) of the locking portion 141 of the resilient piece 137 and preferably substantially at the same position as the touching portion 143 in forward and backward directions. In other words, a formation range of the restricting portion 138 substantially in<br>
forward and backward directions preferably includes an area corresponding to at least a lengthwise (forward and backward directions) middle part of the resilient piece 137 out of a curvable area from the base end of the resilient piece 137 to the locking portion 141, i.e. is limited to a range of an area not corresponding to the extending end (locking portion 141) of the resilient piece 137 preferably in the substantially entire length of the resilient piece 137. Accordingly, the front end of the resilient piece 137 (particularly the range including the projecting end 142 and the substantially front half of the touching portion 143 of the locking portion 141) projects more forward than the front end of the restricting portion 138. Since the resilient piece 137 has a most area thereof excluding the front end covered by the restricting portion 138 from above (from the outer side), the resilient piece 137 is protected from the interference of external matters by the restricting portion 138. Further, a space for permitting upward resilient displacement and curved deformation of the resilient piece 137 preferably is defined between the lower surface of the restricting portion 138 and the upper surface of the resilient piece 137. An arcuate contact portion 145 is formed at or near the lower edge of the end (front end) of the restricting portion 138 at the substantially same side as the extending end of the resilient piece 137. The restricting portion 138 is also formed with a (preferably single) window portion 169 (corresponding to a preferred "opening") at a widthwise intermediate position (preferably substantially a widthwise center position) near the rear end edge. The window portion 169 of the restricting portion 138 preferably is a loop hole, specifically a round hole. When the detecting member 133 is in a state before being assembled or in a standby state (standby position SP), a part of the detecting member 133, specifically, the upper surface of the supporting portion 136 can be seen through the window<br>
portion 169. When the detecting member 133 is at the detection position DP, a part of the housing 110 specifically the upper surface of the coupling portion 127 can be seen through the window portion 169.<br>
Such a connection detecting member 133 is assembled with the lock arm 124 (preferably substantially from behind) by being slid or displaced with the guide groove(s) 139 engaged with the guide rib(s) 130. When the connection detecting member 133 reaches the initial or stand-by position SP, the retaining projections 140 pass the stoppers 131 to be engaged with the stoppers 131 from front as shown in FIG. 16, thereby preventing a backward movement of the connection detecting member 133, and the touching portion 143 at the front end of the resilient piece 137 comes into engagement with the lock portion 126 from behind, thereby preventing any further forward movement of the connection detecting member 133. As a result, the connection detecting member 133 is held at the initial or stand-by position DP (see FIGS. 12 and 17). In other words, the connection detecting member 133 has its forward (toward the detecting position DP) movement prevented.<br>
The projecting end 142 of the resilient piece 137 is placed on the outer or upper surface of the lock portion 126, and the cut-away portion 144 is obliquely fitted to the lock portion 126 from an upper rear side. In this state, the supporting portion 136 is vertically held between the lower plate 129 and the coupling portion 127, and the coupling portion 127 is vertically held between the supporting portion 136 and the restricting portion 138, whereby the connection detecting member 133 has vertical movements thereof relative to the lock arm 124 prevented.<br>
Further, the supporting portion 136 is held at least partly between the pair of arm portions 125 and the left and right side walls 134 are held in contact with the lateral (left and/or right) inner wall surface(s) of the tubular fitting portion 123, whereby the connection detecting member 133 is prevented from laterally moving relative to the lock arm 124 and the second housing 120. Further, with the connection detecting member 133 located at the initial position SP, the upper surface of the restricting portion 138 preferably substantially is at the same height as or slightly lower than that of the upper wall 123A of the tubular fitting portion 123. Therefore, there is no likelihood that external matters collide with the restricting portion 138 from above.<br>
When the resilient piece 137 is resiliently displaced upward or outward to disengage the locking portion 141 from the lock portion 126, this connection detecting member 133 held or positioned at the initial position SP can be moved forward (substantially in parallel with the connecting direction of the two housings 110,120) while being guided by the guide groove(s) 139 and the guide rib(s) 130. In this moving process, any further forward movement of the connection detecting member 133 preferably is prevented when the bottom end of the touching portion 143 slides on the upper surface of the lock portion 126 and the front end of the restricting portion 138 comes into contact with a front stop portion 123D on a front edge portion 123C of the tubular fitting portion 123. Simultaneously, the touching portion 143 passes the lock portion 126, the resilient piece 137 is resiliently at least partly restored and the touching portion 143 is engaged with the lock portion 126 from front, whereby a backward (toward the initial position SP) of the connection detecting member 133 is prevented to<br><br>
hold or position the connection detecting member 133 at the detecting position DP.<br>
With the connection detecting member 133 located at the detecting position DP, the front ends of the side walls 134 preferably are in contact with the front edge portion 123C from the lower side (from the inner side). Thus, an upward or outward displacement of the front end of the connection detecting member 133, i.e. a resilient displacement of the lock arm 124 to the unlocking posture, is prevented. Even with the connection detecting member 133 located at the detection position DP, there is no likelihood that external matters collide with the restricting portion 138 from above since the upper surface of the restricting portion 138 is at the same height as or slightly lower than that of the upper wall 123A of the tubular fitting portion 123 similar to at the initial position.<br>
Next, functions of this embodiment are described.<br>
In the process of connecting the two housings 110, 120, the receptacle 112 is at least partly fitted or inserted on the terminal holding portion 122 and at least partly inserted into the tubular fitting portion 123. Then, as shown in FIG. 13, the lock portion 126 moves onto the lock projection 113 and, accordingly, the lock arm 124 is resiliently displaced to the unlocking posture. At this time, the connection detecting member 133 also inclines its posture to displace the front end side thereof upward while being united with the lock arm 124. However, since the lock portion 141 is held engaged with the lock portion 126, the connection detecting member 133 cannot move to the detecting position DP.<br>
If the connecting operation of the two housings 110, 120 proceeds in this state, the two housings 110,120 are properly connected as shown in FIG. 14, the lock portion 126 passes the lock projection 113, and the lock arm 124 is resiliently<br>
at least partly restored to the locking posture, whereby the two housings 110,120 are inseparably locked into each other by the engagement of the lock portion 126 and the lock projection 113. Preferably, at the substantially same time as the lock arm 124 is resiliently restored, a part of the connection detecting member 133 except the resilient piece 137 is returned towards or to its original posture together with the lock arm 124. At this time, since the lock projection 113 is located under the locking portion 141 of the resilient piece 137, the resilient piece 137 is resiliently displaced upward or outward relative to the side walls 134 and the restricting portion 138 with the touching portion 143 placed on the outer (upper) surface of the lock projection 113.<br>
When the lock arm 124 is resiliently at least partly restored together with the connection detecting member 133, the contact portion 145 at the front end of the restricting portion 138 may collide with the upper surface of the locking portion 141 from above or outside. Since this position of collision is located at a part of the locking portion 141 in forward and backward directions where the thickness (vertical dimension) is largest, i.e. a part where the touching portion 143 is formed, there is no likelihood of deforming the locking portion 141 held between the restricting portion 138 and the lock projection 113.<br>
In the state where the two housings 110, 120 are properly connected and the connection detecting member 133 is located at the initial position SP, the locking portion 141 and the lock portion 126 are disengaged from each other by an upward or outward movement of the touching portion 143 relative to the lock portion 126. Thus, the connection detecting member 133 is permitted to move forward. Further, since the upper surface of the lock projection 113 in contact with the locking portion 141 and that of the lock portion 126 are located at the<br>
substantially same height so as to be substantially flush with each other, the locking portion 141 can slide in such a manner as to move from the outer (upper) surface of the lock projection 113 onto that of the lock portion 126. In other words, the connection detecting member 133 can slide from the initial position SP to the detecting position DP.<br>
In this state, if the operable portion 135 is pushed from behind or operated to move the connection detecting member 133 towards or to the detecting position DP, the touching portion 143 passes the lock portion 126 as shown in FIG. 15, wherefore the resilient piece 137 is resiliently restored and the touching portion 143 is engaged with the lock portion 126 from front. By this engaging action, the connection detecting member 133 has its backward (toward the initial position SP) returning movement prevented and is held or positioned at the detecting position DP.<br>
In this embodiment, the connection detecting member 133 held at the initial position SP is prevented from being pushed to the detecting position DP in the state where the two housings 110,120 are not connected yet. Specifically, if a strong pushing force is exerted to the operable portion 135 of the connection detecting member 133 held at the initial position from behind, the resilient piece 137 is so resiliently deformed as to curve the part thereof between the base end (rear end) and the locking portion 141 as the part to be engaged with the lock portion 126 upward (direction opposite to the lock projection 113) as shown in FIG. 11. If this resilient deformation amount increases, a forward inclined angle of the front end of the resilient piece 127 increases. Thus, the front end of the projecting end 142 comes substantially into contact with the upper surface of the lock portion 126 to displace the touching portion 143 (upward or outward) relative<br>
to the lock portion 126 and, consequently, the touching portion 143 is disengaged from the lock partion 126. Then, the state of preventing a forward movement of the connection detecting member 133 by the locking portion 141 of the resilient piece 137 is released, wherefore the connection detecting member 133 can move to the detecting position DP.<br>
However, in this embodiment, the restricting portion 138 is provided above the resilient piece 137 and an excessive curved deformation of the resilient piece 137 preferably is prevented by this restricting portion 138. Thus, even if a curved deformation amount of the resilient piece 137 is maximized, the locking portion 141 is held engaged with the lock portion 126 to prevent a forward movement of the connection detecting member 133. In this way, a movement of the connection detecting member 133 to the detecting position is prevented in the state where the two housings 110, 120 are not connected yet.<br>
Out of the curvable area from the base end of the resilient piece 137 to the locking portion 141 engaged with the lock arm 124, the lengthwise intermediate part (preferably the substantially lengthwise middle part) of the resilient piece 137 is maximally displaced when the resilient piece 137 is curved. In view of this point, the restricting portion 138 is formed over the range including the area corresponding to the lengthwise intermediate part (preferably the substantially lengthwise middle part) of the resilient piece 137 in this embodiment. Therefore, the excessive curved deformation of the resilient piece 137 can be effectively prevented.<br>
With the two housings 110, 120 properly connected and the connection detecting member 133 located at the initial position SP, the resilient piece 137 interfering with the lock projection 113 inclines its posture and is displaced toward<br>
the restricting portion 138. A displacement amount of the resilient piece 137 at this time is largest at the extending end (front end) of the resilient piece 137. In view of this point, the formation range of the restricting portion 138 is set in the area of the resilient piece 137 excluding the extending end in this embodiment. Therefore, there is no likelihood of hindering the displacement of the resilient piece 137 due to the interference of the extending end of the resilient piece 137 with the restricting portion 138.<br>
When the resilient piece 137 is relatively displaced to approach the restricting portion 138, the extending end (front end) of the resilient piece 137 comes into contact with the contact portion 145 formed at the front end edge of the restricting portion 138 (end edge at the substantially same side as the extending end of the resilient piece 137). If this contact portion 145 is angular like an edge, the contact portion 145 and the resilient piece 137 may be deformed. In this respect, since the contact portion 145 is arcuate in this embodiment, deformations of the contact portion 145 and the resilient piece 137 can be prevented.<br>
Since the restricting portion 138 is formed integral or unitary to the connection detecting member 133 as a formation base of the resilient piece 137, there is no likelihood of disrupting the positional relationship of the resilient piece<br>
137	and the restricting portion 138.<br>
Further, since the restricting portion 138 is connected with the upper edges of the pair of side walls 134 substantially at right angles and formed to connect this pair of side walls 134, the deflection strength of the restricting portion<br>
138	is higher as compared with the case where the restricting portion in the form<br>
of a single plate singly extends. Therefore, the curved deformation of the resilient piece 137 can be reliably restricted.<br>
Accordingly, to prevent a connection detecting member from moving from an initial position to a detection position in a state where two housings are not connected yet, if an external force is exerted to a connection detecting member 133 to move it toward a detection position DP and a resilient piece 137 is curved and deformed in a state where two housings 110, 120 are not connected yet, the resilient piece 137 comes substantially into contact with a restricting portion 138 before being disengaged from a lock arm 124 to prevent any further curved deformation of the resilient piece 137. Thus, the disengagement of the resilient piece 137 from the lock arm 124 due to its curved deformation can be prevented. Therefore, a movement of the connection detecting member 133 from an initial position SP to the detection position DP can be prevented in the state where the two housings 110, 120 are not connected yet. <modifications><br>
