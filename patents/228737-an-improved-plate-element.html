				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to a laminated panel element with a<br>
heating layer.<br>
Such heater elements applied to glass or other nonconducting<br>
substrates can be used as radiative heater units if the installed<br>
heating power is adequate for this purpose. These heater elements<br>
can be installed on or in building walls or be integrated into<br>
these building as a replacement for the usual (central) heating<br>
units. For this purpose, they do not need to be implemented in<br>
the form of windows but can equally well be in the form of<br>
mirrors, decorative surfaces, etc. Alternatively, it is alos<br>
possible for such panel elements to be used as a general means to<br>
produce heating from the surfaces of technical appliances, for<br>
example domestic appliances, where their laminated installation<br>
height and smooth, easily-cleaned surfaces offer big advantages.<br>
The power requirements of large—area heating layers demand<br>
the use of relatively high voltages. Safe and reliable electrical<br>
isolation must therefore be provided, particularly along the<br>
edges of the panel concerned, which may be coated over its whole<br>
surface.<br><br>
The document DE-A1 198 60 870 describes a panel heater<br>
element of this type, with a glass substrate and its whole<br>
surface coated. In order to ensure safe and reliable isolation<br>
from the outside of the electrically powered coating, a region<br>
forming a frame around the periphery of the coating is isolated<br>
by a separation line and is thus electrically neutralized. Such<br>
an arrangement also protects the coating from corrosion that<br>
penetrates in from the outer edges, but that can only penetrate<br>
as far as the separation line.<br>
The electrical connections to the heating layer are<br>
connected to the coating situated on the inside of<br><br>
the surface surrounded by this frame, other separation<br>
lines defining a heating current path over the whole<br>
surface of the coating. The same document also<br>
discloses the option that consists in coating with an<br>
electrical conductor two or more of the bonded panes of<br>
a laminated or safety glazing panel. The details of the<br>
practical implementation of such a laminated pane will<br>
not however be entered into here, either as regards the<br>
electrical connections or the electrical control of<br>
such a double heating layer.<br>
In another known panel element (document DE-B-2<br>
113 876), the electrically conductive heating coating<br>
does not extend right up to the edge of the panel, such<br>
that a spacer frame for an insulating glazing panel can<br>
be bonded, without any special arrangements, directly<br>
onto the border (where there is no layer) of the<br>
glazing panel. The electrode power supply conductors<br>
pass through sealed feed holes formed in the spacer<br>
frame. The second pane of the insulating glazing panel<br>
has a non-heating solar protection layer.<br>
The prior patent application 102 41 728.8 of<br>
the Applicant describes a connecting device for a<br>
laminated panel element that comprises a first rigid<br>
pane having a heating layer together with a second<br>
rigid pane joined over its whole surface with the first<br>
by adhesion. The connecting device is inserted into a<br>
feed hole formed in one of the rigid panes. It<br>
comprises contacts that allow a direct contact with the<br>
heating layer to be established. For this purpose, the<br>
latter has at least two electrodes that are disposed in<br>
the region of said cut-out. A plurality of current<br>
paths, electrically connected in parallel and formed<br>
within the coating, can run between these electrodes.<br>
The length and width of the current path or<br>
paths together with the surface conductivity (expressed<br>
in ohms per square) of the layer configuration used<br>
will determine the consumption of electrical energy and<br>
the heating power of the panel element. Depending on<br>
the particular power supply voltage available or<br><br>
predetermined, various heating powers can be<br>
established over wide ranges by the current path<br>
pattern, the maximum admissible temperature also<br>
depending on the type of use of the finished panel<br>
element. If, for example, it is not possible for the<br>
user to come into direct contact with it, or this need<br>
not be assumed, the temperatures can be well above<br>
50°C. However, care must of course be taken to ensure<br>
that coatings adhering to the coated pane, for example<br>
adhesive layers of a laminated glazing panel, are not<br>
degraded at the temperatures that may be reached during<br>
normal operation.<br>
In the literature, various materials are<br>
mentioned that are suitable for such heating layers.<br>
Solely as examples, indium tin oxide (ITO) and metals<br>
that are good conductors such as gold, silver, copper<br>
or aluminum are mentioned here. Layer configurations<br>
having dielectric antireflection layers and at least<br>
one metallic layer situated between them allow very<br>
good transmission of visible light with satisfactory<br>
electrical conductivity, but can also be used, at the<br>
same time, as infrared reflectors. Such typical layer<br>
configurations exhibit sheet resistances in the range<br>
of 1 to 4 Q per square.<br>
When these heater elements operate at high<br>
heating powers, . the adhesive layer, generally a<br>
thermoplastic (preferably, a PVB, PMMA or EVA sheet) ,<br>
can reach its thermal limits. The adhesion to the<br>
(coated) glass surfaces may fail when the full heating<br>
power is applied for a sufficiently long period. In<br>
some cases, and in particular at high current density<br>
locations, this can lead to local delaminations of the<br>
coating. Since, for reasons of production method and<br>
costT moving away from the adhesives tried and tested<br>
over several years in laminated glass manufacturing is<br>
undesirable, other means of avoiding these thermal<br>
problems must be found.<br><br>
The object of the invention consists in solving this problem<br>
by proposing a better laminated panel element with heating layers.<br>
Firstly, with a double coating, the option is proposed which<br>
consists in obtaining the same heating power as with a single<br>
coating without a significant increase in the heater unit volume,<br>
the layer thicknesses being in the nanometer range with a much<br>
lower current per unit area for each coating. Heat is not then<br>
produced in only one of the interface layers situated between a<br>
glass panel and the adhesive layer. Furthermore, the thermal<br>
loading of the connection electrodes, through which all the<br>
current must flow into all the current paths, is reduced.<br>
Another feature of this configuration according to the invention<br>
resides in the fact that the two coatings are electrically<br>
connected via a flat side of the panel element, owing to the<br>
fact that one of the two panels has cut-out that allows the<br>
passage of external connections.<br>
In a first advantageous embodiment of the invention, the two<br>
coatings are disposed on either side of the adhesive layer that<br>
joins the two rigid panes. In a second advantageous embodiment<br><br>
which, depending on the thickness of the rigid panes, may yield a<br>
slightly greater total thickness for the laminated panel element*<br>
a third rigid pane is provided and at least one heating layer is<br>
disposed on each side of the third right pane,. In particular, it<br>
is not absolutely necessary that the central pane hold the two<br>
heating layers, several variant arrangements being possible, as<br>
will be explained in more detail below.<br>
Other combinations of the two variants may also be<br>
implemented where an even greater distribution of the<br>
heating power is desired, and if required and<br><br>
within the scope of the present invention, other rigid<br>
panes (coated or uncoated) may also be added.<br>
In all the configurations, the distribution of<br>
the heating can be controlled, on the one hand if the<br>
two coatings are identical and are powered by identical<br>
supply voltages (preferably, the normal mains voltage<br>
in the country concerned (for example, 110 or 230<br>
VAC)).<br>
In an advantageous development, the coatings<br>
that each form one or more resistive heater elements<br>
(in parallel) can each be used separately from one<br>
another or be used in a series or in a parallel<br>
circuit.<br>
In the latter case, the highest heating power<br>
can be obtained; the latter can be used, for example,<br>
for heating the heater element when still cold,<br>
returning to a lower heating power for the longer-term<br>
operation.<br>
The configuration according to the invention<br>
however also allows the two coatings to be provided<br>
with completely different properties. On the one hand,<br>
they may be made of different materials. Their<br>
resistances can be adjusted over wide ranges, for<br>
example by the choice of the specific conductivity<br>
and/or of the internal structure of the layer<br>
configuration, such that different heating powers are<br>
obtained even for the same applied supply voltage.<br>
On the other hand, the coatings may also be<br>
applied with various thicknesses. Thus, the sheet<br>
resistances can again be adjusted depending on whether<br>
the coatings of various thicknesses are formed from<br>
identical materials or from different materials.<br>
In addition, especially in the case of<br>
transparent panel heater elements, the choice of<br>
material also allows a desired colored appearance to be<br>
obtained. For example, a gold coating has a more or<br>
less pronounced red or golden tint, whereas layers of<br>
silver have a more neutral tint.<br><br>
It is clear that, in a manner known per se, on<br>
a panel element according to the invention, two or more<br>
current paths may also be provided which, if required,<br>
may be connected independently of one another, within<br>
either or both of the coatings, in order to be able to<br>
connect and disconnect the heating power in stages if<br>
needed. This will depend on the number of contacts or<br>
electrodes available on the coatings.<br>
During the manufacture of panel heater elements<br>
not to be used as windows, the antireflection coating<br>
of the conducting layer itself, for example made of<br>
silver or another conducting metal, could be eliminated<br>
which, on the one hand, would simplify the power<br>
connections (dielectric antireflection layers are<br>
usually nonconducting or are poor conductors), and on<br>
the other hand, would allow decorative effects to be<br>
obtained on the surface. The precise determination of<br>
suitable materials for the configuration of heating<br>
layers is however left to the discretion of those<br>
skilled in the art who have the task of calibrating the<br>
desired heating power.<br>
As an extra feature, one or more temperature<br>
probes can be provided for detecting the effective<br>
temperature of the panel element. Such temperature<br>
probes may even be implemented in the form of current<br>
limiters (for example, cold conductors whose<br>
electrical/ohmic resistance increases with<br>
temperature). As a variant, a separate switching<br>
mechanism can be provided for disconnecting the heating<br>
power if there is a risk of overheating of the panel<br>
element, where this mechanism can be controlled by a<br>
temperature probe.<br>
In a particularly advantageous manner, the<br>
panel element according to the invention can be<br>
equipped with a connecting device of the type described<br>
in the aforementioned prior application. It is possible<br>
to connect the two heating layers simultaneously to a<br>
single connecting device which will be disposed in the<br>
cut-out of one of the panes. The electrical connections<br><br>
of the heater element can thus be advantageously<br>
grouped in a very compact fashion. At the same time,<br>
the connecting element can comprise the switching<br>
elements necessary for controlling the heating power of<br>
the heater element. These are, in particular, elements<br>
for the independent control of one or both coatings,<br>
and, where required, of two or more independent current<br>
paths situated within one or both coatings, which<br>
elements allow parallel or serial connections to be<br>
established, together with, in some cases, switching<br>
elements controlled by thermoprobe. Lastly, as a safety<br>
cut-off, switching elements can be provided that are<br>
required in case of possible rupture of the glass<br>
heater element.<br>
This connecting device has the advantage of<br>
being able to be mounted after the manufacture of the<br>
laminated panel element and also of being able to be<br>
removed from it, if needed. It is particularly<br>
preferable that the connecting device be fitted with<br>
removable contact means, for example plug or spring<br>
contacts. For relatively high supply voltages of the<br>
laminated panel element, they only have to transmit<br>
small (AC) currents; in addition, heater elements used<br>
in buildings are not, as a general rule, subject to<br>
vibrations. Thus, problems of corrosion should not be<br>
expected which, in other fields of application (vehicle<br>
manufacture), can have the effect of reducing the<br>
contact efficiency by increasing the contact<br>
resistance. Furthermore, the connection or contact area<br>
may, if necessary, be hermetically sealed in order to<br>
prevent dampness or dirt penetrating into the system.<br>
If necessary, the electrical contacts onto the<br>
active elements or, as the case may be, onto their<br>
electrodes can, however, also be attached by soldering<br>
or only be protected as an option. Soldering techniques<br>
are known that allow the soldering points to be melted<br>
reliably without direct contact with the heat source<br>
(induction or laser soldering) or which can even be<br><br>
used through the coated pane without however damaging<br>
the coating.<br>
A panel element equipped according to the<br>
invention may be used as a stand-alone heating unit. It<br>
can also be integrated into an insulating glazing panel<br>
in which it is joined to another pane via a separation<br>
frame. It is clear that other (glass) panels may also<br>
be included within a laminate joined over its whole<br>
surface to the two rigid panes of the panel heater<br>
element without, by doing this, straying from the idea<br>
on which the invention is based.<br>
Other details and advantages of the subject of<br>
the invention will become apparent from the figures of<br>
an exemplary embodiment and a variant embodiment and<br>
from the description which is presented in the<br>
following section.<br>
In simplified accompaning drawings" that are not to scale,<br>
Figure 1 shows a cross-sectional view of a<br>
laminated panel element according to the invention in<br>
the region of a connecting device, two electrical<br>
heating coatings being disposed on either side of a<br>
single adhesive layer, and<br>
Figure 2 shows a cross-sectional view of a<br>
variant of the laminated panel element according to the<br>
invention having a third rigid pane and two electrical<br>
heating coatings situated on either side of the central<br>
rigid panel.<br>
In Figure 1, a panel heater element 1 according<br>
to the invention is fabricated in the form of a<br>
laminated glazing panel having a first rigid pane 2, an<br>
adhesive layer 3 and a second rigid pane 4. The two<br>
rigid panes 2 and 4 are preferably thermally<br>
prestressed, or partially prestressed. On their flat<br>
sides facing the adhesive layer 3, each of the two<br>
panes has a heating layer 5. Only a part of the<br>
thickness of the rigid pane 2 is shown and a double<br>
transverse dashed line on the rigid pane 4 indicates<br>
that its thickness shown has also been truncated. It<br><br>
will be understood that these two rigid panes are<br>
considerably thicker than the adhesive layer 3.<br>
The heating layers 5 consist of compositions<br>
and/or successions of layers that are sufficiently<br>
resistant to the thermal stresses when they function as<br>
surface heating layers and that are suitable for the<br>
particular application and, where required, for the<br>
pane prestressing. Suitable layer configurations have<br>
been described in numerous variants in the prior art,<br>
so that these does not need to be considered further<br>
here. Layer configurations with a high visible light<br>
transmission can be implemented that are therefore<br>
transparent.<br>
For example, a coating marketed by the<br>
Applicant under the name of "Planitherm 1.3" can be<br>
used, where the number represents it k index. This is a<br>
layer configuration with a high thermal resistance and<br>
capable of being prestressed, having a silver layer and<br>
dielectric antireflection layers on both sides of this<br>
layer, and which also possesses infrared reflection<br>
properties.<br>
However, depending on the requirements, other<br>
electrically conducting layer configurations may, of<br>
course, also be used. Their sheet resistance will need<br>
to be in the range from 1 to 2 5 ohms per square. The<br>
lower the sheet resistance, the larger can be the flat<br>
heater element that must be heated with a given<br>
voltage.<br>
Suitable means ensure, in a manner ' known per<br>
se, the peripheral passivation of the coatings 5 along<br>
the edges (not shown here) of the panel element, in<br>
other words that there is no electrically conducting<br>
contact with either its outside surface or with its<br>
front surface, nor is there any risk of corrosive<br>
attack of the layer material from the outside. In any<br>
case, a hermetic covering of the border gap is obtained<br>
by means of the synthetic thermoplastic adhesive that<br>
forms the adhesive layer 3 (for example, polyvinyl<br>
butyral (PVB), ethylene/vinyl acetate (VA)). It will be<br><br>
understood that the adhesive layer material must be<br>
chosen to be compatible with the material of the<br>
coating 5.<br>
The cross-sectional view shows the essential<br>
components of the electrical power supply of the two<br>
heating layers 5 in a common connection area. Each of<br>
them has (at least) two plane electrodes 6 that are<br>
disposed on both sides of an insulating separation line<br>
7 that isolates two electrical poles of the heating<br>
layers 5 from one another. The heating layers 5, which<br>
are initially deposited continuously, are divided, in a<br>
manner known per se, into current paths by structure<br>
lines created later. This defines the current paths<br>
between the two pairs of electrodes 6, such that the<br>
current flows over the whole surface of the panel<br>
element. The current paths (not shown here) can be, but<br>
are not required to be, identical for the two coatings<br>
5.<br>
The electrodes 6 of the two layers 5 can also,<br>
depending on the requirements, be implemented in the<br>
same or in different ways. The same currents will not<br>
necessarily be required to flow, nor will the same<br>
heating power necessarily be expected, in both coatings<br>
5 for all applications.<br>
The electrodes 6 themselves are opaque and<br>
cannot be visible from the outside. Consequently, they<br>
can also be configured as decorative elements, for<br>
example representing the logo of a firm or<br>
manufacturer.<br>
Unlike the succession of layers shown, the<br>
electrodes 6 may also be deposited under the coatings<br>
5, in other words before their deposition onto the<br>
glass surfaces. They can take the form of thin metal<br>
foils or else as ribbons of conductive screen-printing<br>
paste that can be baked (during the prestressing of the<br>
panes). Suitable embodiments of electrodes, which are<br>
also referred to as collection rails, have been widely<br>
described in the prior art. By coloring the conductive<br><br>
screen-printing paste used for the electrodes, given<br>
colored effects can also be obtained.<br>
It is clear that, where necessary, the<br>
electrical contact area can be visually masked by<br>
suitable means, for example by placing an opaque<br>
decoration underneath it or by printing such a<br>
decoration onto it, or else by using a very dark<br>
colored glass paste for the panes. As an example, in<br>
the region of the electrodes the pane 4 has an opaque<br>
coating 8 which is not electrically conducting and<br>
which was printed onto the surface of the glass before<br>
the deposition of the coating 5 and then heat treated<br>
during the prestressing process.<br>
In the connection area of the electrodes 6, a<br>
feed hole or a cut-out 9 is formed in the pane 4 and in<br>
the adhesive layer 3. This allows the passage of the<br>
external electrical connections for the two pairs of<br>
electrodes 6 of the two coatings 5. The cut-out in the<br>
adhesive layer 3 is cut to size before the two rigid<br>
panes 2 and 4 are joined together, such that the<br>
adhesive material does not penetrate as far as the<br>
electrodes 6 by melting. Where necessary, suitable<br>
protection measures will be taken.<br>
An insert 10 in the form of a bushing is fixed<br>
in the feed hole 9 of the pane 4. Its axial length<br>
corresponds substantially to the thickness of the rigid<br>
pane 4 (a few millimeters) , and it penetrates as far as<br>
the plane of the adhesive layer 3. A radial shoulder 11<br>
that overhangs toward the outside hooks onto the rear<br>
edge of the feed hole 9, such that the insert 10 is<br>
fixed there in geometric correspondence which prevents<br>
it being extracted.<br>
This insert must already be in place in the<br>
feed hole 9 before joining the two rigid panes 2 and 4.<br>
Only when the thermoplastic adhesive layer 3 has melted<br>
will it be definitively fixed. It can be seen in the<br>
drawing that the shoulder 11 is further held within the<br>
material of the adhesive layer 3.<br><br>
The insert 10 forms the mechanical base of a<br>
connection housing 12. Two vertical dashed lines<br>
indicate a threaded link between the two parts allowing<br>
them to be separated. A support block 13 is fitted into<br>
the center hole of the insert 10 through the connection<br>
housing 12. This forms the base of two pairs 14, 15 of<br>
spring contacts that are pushed into contact with the<br>
electrodes 6. The inside pair 14 of spring contacts is<br>
disposed at the lower end of a short axial appendage<br>
from the support block 13. The latter has a slightly-<br>
smaller diameter or periphery than the support block 13<br>
itself. The spring contacts are placed in direct<br>
electrical conduction on the electrodes 6 of the<br>
coating 5 of the (lower) pane 2. The power supply or<br>
heating voltage is brought to the coating of the rigid<br>
pane 2 by these contacts 14.<br>
Although the spring contacts 14 suffice, in the<br>
intended application of the surface heater element 1<br>
(relatively high supply voltage, AC current), for the<br>
demands of a safe and durable electrical connection, if<br>
necessary, they can optionally be welded to the<br>
electrodes 6, in particular with suitable pre-applied<br>
tinning, where the required heat can preferably be<br>
supplied without contact (by induction or by laser).<br>
The outside pair of spring contacts 15 extends<br>
from the support block 13 at the shoulder formed at the<br>
transition with its appendage. The spring contacts 15<br>
are not in direct contact with the surface electrodes 6<br>
of the heating layer 5 of the (upper) rigid pane 4,<br>
since the latter must terminate on either side of the<br>
feed hole 9. However, the insert 10 has two connecting<br>
bridges 16 for this purpose. On one side, they<br>
penetrate into the center hole of the insert 10. They<br>
stop on either side of the appendage of the support<br>
block 13 and form the elements that are directly<br>
complementary to the spring contacts 15. On the other<br>
side, they pass through the wall of the insert 10 and<br>
rest on either side against the (upper) surface of the<br><br>
shoulder 11 of the insert 10, namely the surface facing<br>
the coating 5 of the pane 4.<br>
After the insertion and the fixing of the<br>
insert 10 into the feed hole 9 of the rigid pane 4 and<br>
after the bonding of the two rigid panes 2 and 4, the<br>
shoulder 11 holds the connecting bridges 16 in contact<br>
with the (upper) flat electrodes 6. The insert 10 is<br>
screwed into the connection housing 12. In this way,<br>
the shoulder 11 is pulled with a prestressing against<br>
the flat electrodes 6 and this contact area is not<br>
particularly critical. The surfaces of the connecting<br>
bridges 16 in contact with the flat electrodes 6 can be<br>
roughened or have points allowing a certain penetration<br>
of the connecting bridges into the flat electrodes 6.<br>
Here also, as has already been indicated above, by<br>
applying heat, additional soldering, with pretinning of<br>
the connecting bridges and/or of the flat electrodes,<br>
can however be implemented.<br>
The connecting bridges 16 are preferably fixed<br>
into the insert 10 so that the connecting device can be<br>
assembled as easily as possible. This can be achieved,<br>
for example, by coating the connecting bridges 16<br>
(narrow sheet-metal strips) with the synthetic material<br>
of the insert 10 during its manufacture.<br>
The support block 13 with the spring contacts<br>
14, 15 is inserted into the insert 10 in the correct<br>
position, if necessary by applying force with suitably<br>
fashioned elements, such that the spring contacts 14,<br>
15 come into contact with the corresponding<br>
complementary element (electrode, bridge contact), and<br>
is then fixed. The support block 13 can form an<br>
integral assembly with the connection housing 12 and be<br>
fixed at the same time as the latter onto the insert<br>
10. The axial and radial offset between the pairs 14<br>
and 15 of spring contacts allow direct contacts between<br>
them to be excluded.<br>
The circuit symbols of a switch 17 and a<br>
transistor 18 represent the electrical or electronic<br>
equipment of the support block 13 or of the connection<br><br>
housing 12 and may each correspond to a plurality of<br>
corresponding elements. In addition to the passage of<br>
the electrical supply voltage from the connecting cable<br>
to the electrodes 6, other control and switching<br>
functions are attributed to this part of the connecting<br>
device. In particular, these switching elements provide<br>
the voltage-controlled power supply of one or of both<br>
of the coatings depending on the corresponding<br>
instructions from the external control as was already<br>
explained above.<br>
In the connection part, by means of the insert<br>
10 and the support block 13, one or more temperature<br>
probes (not shown) may also be maintained in contact<br>
with one or more coated panes 2 and 4 in order to<br>
detect the effective temperature in the contact area of<br>
the electrodes 6.<br>
A switching element can then evaluate the<br>
measured values from the temperature probe and, if<br>
necessary, disconnect, at least momentarily, the<br>
current feed to one of the heating layers or both, if<br>
the effective temperature were to exceed an acceptable<br>
threshold. However, a switching element can also be<br>
provided that protects against temperature excesses and<br>
that, in a manner known per se, limits the electrical<br>
power consumed to acceptable levels.<br>
At least one switching device, which may have<br>
an electronic or electromechanical configuration,<br>
manages the current feed to the heating layers. This<br>
switching device may fundamentally be manually<br>
connected locally, be controlled by sensors, for<br>
example by the temperature probe, or by a window<br>
control device. As has already been indicated, the<br>
latter may be part of an automatic temperature<br>
regulation system for the premises (air conditioning<br>
installation, etc.), however it can fundamentally also<br>
be selectively controlled manually.<br>
If the control signals are transmitted by<br>
wireless, a suitable receiver will be provided in the<br>
connection housing 8 or in the support block 13, in<br><br>
addition to a decoder and other switching means (for<br>
example, amplifiers). If the control signals are<br>
transmitted by lines, suitable evaluation means will be<br>
provided for these, in particular where the control<br>
signals are transmitted via already existing mains<br>
connection lines and must be filtered at their input.<br>
In a particularly advantageous embodiment, all<br>
of the electrical devices or interfaces are thus<br>
assembled locally in the connection part of the panel<br>
heater element 1.<br>
After the connecting device has been built and<br>
its operation verified, if necessary, the transition<br>
between the pane surface and the connection housing 12<br>
can be further made hermetically tight by a hermetic<br>
seal 19. Unlike the embodiment shown in the drawing,<br>
this hermetic seal may, of course, be installed<br>
directly between the lower face of the connection<br>
housing 12 and the pane surface.<br>
While the insert 10 can, in practice, be joined<br>
flush with the main surface of the rigid pane 4, the<br>
connection housing 12 will be slightly protruding from<br>
this surface. Since, in most cases, this side of the<br>
flat heater element 1 is not turned toward the observer<br>
or user in, the installed position and/or is, for<br>
example, placed facing or within a wall, the visibility<br>
of the connecting device on the mask (or,<br>
alternatively, on the opaque electrode 6 serving as a<br>
decorative element) remains limited, and moreover, the<br>
risks of unauthorized or accidental handling of the<br>
connecting device are, in practice, excluded. Where an<br>
activation switch of a control unit for the connecting<br>
device needs to be provided, this will, of course, be<br>
preferably installed in an easily accessible place, for<br>
example close to the edge of the flat heater element.<br>
In Figure 2, identical elements to those in<br>
Figure 1 have been given the same reference numbers.<br>
Here, the laminated panel element is equipped with a<br>
third (lower) rigid pane 2 0 that is joined by surface<br>
adhesion to the central rigid pane 2 by means of an<br><br>
adhesive layer 3. The surfaces situated at the top in<br>
the drawing of the two rigid panes 2 and 20 have a flat<br>
heating coatings 5. Once again, the two coatings 5 each<br>
have a pair of electrodes 6. The explanation presented<br>
for Figure 1 also applies to the division of the<br>
coatings 5 and the current paths between the pair of<br>
electrodes 6, as well as to the electrical control and<br>
the operation in general.<br>
Here also, the rigid pane 2 is crossed by a<br>
feed hole 21 that is oriented substantially axially<br>
with respect to the feed hole 9 of the rigid pane 4.<br>
The second adhesive layer 3 has a corresponding cut-out<br>
in which the electrodes 6 of the lower coating<br>
terminate. An axial extension 22 of the support block<br>
13	is inserted into the feed hole 21 with the<br>
connection housing and the support block. Its diameter<br>
or, as the case may be, its periphery is smaller than<br>
that of the support block 13. There is a given amount<br>
of radial play between it and the wall of the feed hole<br>
21, in order to compensate any possible differences<br>
between the centers of the drilled holes 9 and 21 which<br>
could result from the manufacture of the laminated<br>
pane. It extends in the longitudinal direction up to<br>
just before the surface of the third pane 20 situated<br>
in the laminate. Here also, contacts between the pairs<br>
14	and 15 of spring contacts are excluded by an axial<br>
offset and a radial offset.<br>
The spring contacts 14 shown in Figure 1 are<br>
disposed here at the lower end of the appendage 22 and<br>
rest on the electrodes 6 of the lower coating 5 with an<br>
adequate contact pressure. On the other hand, the<br>
spring contacts 15 again extend from the shoulder of<br>
the support block 13 formed at the transition with the<br>
appendage 22. They are situated directly on the<br>
electrodes 6 of the upper coating 5 of the central pane<br>
2.<br>
In another variant (not shown) of the double-<br>
layer heater, it is, or course, possible to deposit a<br>
coating 5 on the lower surface of the upper pane 4 (as<br><br>
shown in Figure 1) instead of depositing it on the<br>
upper surface of the central pane 2, and to implement<br>
its contact in a manner corresponding to that of Figure<br>
1.<br>
While in the configuration shown in Figure 1 a<br>
substantially identical thermal radiation is emitted<br>
from both sides of the panel element (in the case of a<br>
completely symmetrical implementation which therefore<br>
has the same electrical power for the two coatings and<br>
the same thicknesses for the rigid panes), another<br>
arrangement of the coatings in the laminate allows an<br>
asymmetric radiation to be obtained which, if there is<br>
a need, could be wholly desirable.<br>
In the same way, other combinations of layer<br>
arrangements, possibly with three or more heating<br>
layers, still remain within the scope of the invention<br>
described here.<br><br>
