APPARATUS FOR REDUCING THE<br>
EFFECTS OF GENERAL ANESTHETICS<br>
PRIORITY CLAIM<br>
This application claims the benefit of the filing date of United States Provisional<br>
Patent Application Serial Number 60/466,934, filed May 1,2003, for "Apparatus and<br>
Techniques for Reducing the Effects of General Anesthetics," and United States Non-<br>
Provisional Patent Application Serial Number 10/680,469, filed October 7,2003, for<br>
"Apparatus and Techniques for Reducing the Effects of General Anesthetics," pending.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates generally to apparatus and techniques for<br>
reversing the effects of inhaled general anesthetics. More particularly, the present<br>
invention relates to use of ventilation and rebreathing apparatus and, optionally,<br>
respiratory monitoring apparatus, in conjunction with one another to reverse the effects<br>
of inhaled general anesthetics.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
General anesthesia is often administered to individuals as surgical procedures<br>
are being performed. Typically, an individual who is subject to general anesthesia is<br>
"hooked up" to a ventilator by way of a breathing circuit One or more sensors may<br>
communicate with the breathing circuit to facilitate monitoring of the individual's<br>
respiration, the anesthesia, and, possibly, the individual's blood gases and blood flow.<br>
One or more anesthetic agents are typically administered to the individual through the<br>
breathing circuit<br>
Examples of breathing circuits that are used while anesthesia is being<br>
administered to a patient indude circular breathing circuits, which are also referred to<br>
in the art as "circle systems," and Mapleson or Bain type breathing circuits, which are<br>
also referred to herein as Bain systems for the sake of simplicity.<br>
Circle systems are typically used with adult patients. The expiratory and<br>
inspiratory limbs of a breathing circuit of a circle system communicate with one<br>
another, with a carbon dioxide remover, such as a soda lime can, being disposed<br>
therebetween. As the expiratory and inspiratory limbs communicate with one another,<br><br>
WO 2004/098688	PCT/US2004/012291<br>
-2-<br>
a circle system will typically include two or more sets of one-way valves to prevent a<br>
patient from rebreafhing just-expired, CO2-rich gases.<br>
Bain systems are typically used with smaller patients (e,g., children). Bain<br>
systems include linear tubes through which both inspiratory and expiratory gases flow.<br>
Fresh gases are typically directed toward a patient interface to remove the just-expired<br>
gases therefrom before the patient can rebreathe them. As long as the fresh gas flow is<br>
higher than the flow of the patient's ventilation, there is little or no rebreathing.<br>
When a general anesthesia is administered to an individual, respiratory or<br>
inhaled anesthetics are delivered to a patient in low concentrations, typically being<br>
diluted to a concentration of about 1% to about 5%, depending on the type of anesthetic<br>
agent used. As the individual inhales a general anesthetic agent, the anesthetic agent is<br>
carried into the lungs, where it enters the bloodstream, and is carried by the blood to<br>
various other body tissues. Once the concentration of the anesthetic reaches a sufficient<br>
level, or threshold level, in the brain, which depends upon a variety of<br>
individual-specific factors, including the size and weight of the individual, the '<br>
individual becomes anesthetized. The individual remains anesthetized so long as the<br>
concentration of the anesthetic agent in the brain of the individual remains above the<br>
threshold level.<br>
Once the procedure, typically surgery, for which the general anesthesia is given,<br>
has been completed, it is usually desirable to reverse the effects of the general<br>
anesthetic as soon as possible. Reversal of the effects of general anesthesia allows the<br>
surgical team to vacate the operating room, thereby freeing it up for subsequent<br>
surgeries and possibly reducing the cost of surgery, and also permits the anesthetist to<br>
tend to other patients, and conserves the typically expensive anesthetic agents that are<br>
used. In addition, for safety reasons, it is desirable to minimize the time an individual<br>
is under general anesthesia. Other benefits of quickly reversing anesthesia include<br>
better cognitive function for elderly patients immediately following surgery and<br>
enabling patients to protect their own airway sooner<br>
Reversal or discontinuation of the general anesthetic state requires that levels of.<br>
the anesthetic agent in the brain decrease below the threshold level, or that the<br>
anesthetic agent be removed from the individual's brain.<br>
It has long been known that activated charcoal and other substances can be used<br>
to selectively adsorb gaseous anesthetic agents. Accordingly, activated charcoal has<br><br>
WO 2004/098688	PCT/US2004/012291<br>
-3-<br>
found conventional use in adsorbers, such as that described in U.S. Patent 5,471,979,<br>
issued to Psaros et al., that prevents anesthetic agents from escaping the breathing<br>
circuit and entering the operating room. In this regard, activated charcoal adsorbers are<br>
typically placed in the exhaust flow of the anesthesia delivery system. The potentially<br>
deleterious effects of exhaust anesthetic gases into the operating room are thereby<br>
avoided. Further, as most halocarbon anesthetics are considered to be atmospheric<br>
pollutants, the charcoals or other adsorbents of conventional anesthetic agent adsorbers<br>
prevent pollution that may be caused if gaseous anesthetic agents were otherwise<br>
released into the environment.<br>
U.S. Patent 5,094,235, issued to Westenskow et al. (hereinafter "Westenskow"),<br>
describes the use of activated charcoal to hasten the removal of gaseous anesthetic<br>
agents from breathing circuits. While such a technique would be useful for preventing<br>
the reinhalation of previously exhaled anesthetic agents, more could be done to hasten<br>
the rate at which anesthetic agents are removed from the individual's brain.<br>
Typically, the rate at which blood flows through the brain and an individuaTs<br>
breathing rate and breathing volume are the primary factors that determine the rate at<br>
which the levels of anesthetic agent are removed from the brain of the individual. The<br>
rate of blood flow through the brain is a determining factor because the blood carries<br>
anesthetic agents away from the brain and to the lungs. The breathing rate and<br>
breathing volume are important since they increase the rate at which anesthetic agent<br>
may be removed from the Wood and transported out of the body through the lungs.<br>
Hyperventilation has been used to increase the breath volume and/or rate of an<br>
individual and, thereby, to facilitate the removal of anesthetic agents from the<br>
individual's lungs. However, hyperventilation typically results in a reduced level of<br>
carbon dioxide (CO2) in blood of the individual (PaCO2). When PaCO2 levels are<br>
decreased, the brain is less likely to signal the lungs to breathe on their own and the<br>
patient remains dependent on the ventilation from an artificial respirator. See U.S.<br>
Patent 5,320,093, issued to Reamer (hereinafter "Raemer"). Additionally, the reduced<br>
PaCO2 levels that result from hyperventilation are known to cause a corresponding<br>
reduction in the rate at which blood flows through the brain, which actually decreases<br>
the rate at which the blood can carry anesthetic agents away from the brain.<br>
Rebreathing processes, in which an individual "rebreathes" previously exhaled,<br>
. CCVrich air, have been used to prevent significant decreases in PaCC&gt;2 levels during<br><br>
WO 2004/098688	PCT/US2004/012291<br>
-4-<br>
such hyperventilation. The apparatus that have been conventionally used to effect such<br>
processes, however, do not filter anesthetic agent from the exhaled air before the<br>
individual rebreathes the same. Consequently, the patient also rebreathes the<br>
previously exhaled anesthetic agent, which effectively prolongs the process of<br>
reversing the general anesthesia.<br>
The computerized system described in Raemer was designed to overcome<br>
purported deficiencies with hyperventilation and rebreathing. The system of Raemer<br>
infuses CO2 from an external source into the breathing circuit and, thus, into the<br>
individual's lungs (le., the CO2 is not rebreathed by the individual) as general<br>
anesthesia is being reversed to speed the rate of reversal and, thus, recovery of the<br>
individual from the general anesthesia. The teachings of Raemer with respect to<br>
infusion of CO2 from an external source are limited to avoidance of reintrodudng<br>
anesthetic agents into the individual's brain while increasing the individuaTs PaCO2 to<br>
a level that will facilitate reinitiation of spontaneous breathing by his or her brain as<br>
early as possible. As the technique and system that are taught in Raemer do not include<br>
increases in the breathing rate or breathing volume of an individual, they do not<br>
accelerate the rate at which an individual recovers from anesthesia.<br>
Accordingly, there are needs for processes and apparatus which increase the rate<br>
at which blood carries anesthetic agents from the brain, as well as the rate at which the<br>
lungs expel the anesthetic agents from the body in order to minimize the time required<br>
to reverse the levels of anesthetic agents in the brain to reverse the effects thereof.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention includes methods and apparatus for accelerating the rate<br>
at which an individual recovers from general anesthesia, or for reversing the effects of<br>
anesthetic agents. These methods and apparatus maintain or increase the rate at which<br>
blood flows through the individual's brain, increase the individual's rate of respiration<br>
and respiratory volume, and prevent the individual from reinhaling previously exhaled<br>
anesthetic agents.<br>
A method according to the present invention includes increasing the rate at<br>
which the individual inhales or the volume of gases inhaled by the individual, which<br>
may be effected with a ventilator, or respirator, while causing the individual to at least<br>
periodically breathe gases including an elevated fraction of CO2. This may be effected<br><br>
WO 2004/098688	PCT/US2004/012291<br>
-5-<br>
by causing the individual to rebreathe at least some of the gases that the individual has<br>
already exhaled or by otherwise increasing the amount of CO2 in gases that are to be<br>
inhaled by the individual. The rebreathed gases are filtered to at least partially remove<br>
some of the previously exhaled anesthetic agent or agents therefrom. It is currently<br>
preferred that substantially all anesthetic agents be removed from the exhaled gases<br>
prior to rebreathing thereof.<br>
An apparatus that incorporates teachings of the present invention is configured<br>
to facilitate breathing by an individual at a rapid (i.e., above-normal) rate, while<br>
maintaining CO2 levels in the blood individual's blood, thereby at least maintaining the<br>
rate at which blood flows to and through the individual's brain. Such an apparatus<br>
includes a filter to selectively remove anesthetic agents from gases that have been<br>
exhaled by the individual, as well a component that is configured to effect partial<br>
rebreathing by the individual, which is also referred to herein as a **rebreathing<br>
element," or another component which is configured to increase the levels of CO2<br>
inhaled by the individual. The rebreathing or other CO2 level-elevating component of<br>
the apparatus facilitates an increase in the rate of ventilation of the individual, while<br>
CO2 levels in blood of the individual (i.e., PaCO2) remain normal or elevated. The<br>
rebreathing or other CO2 level-elevating component further allows the patient to be<br>
mechanically ventilated using a respirator at a high volume or rate while maintaining<br>
high or normal levels of CO2.<br>
Other features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent to<br>
those of ordinary skill in the art mrough consideration of the ensuing description, the<br>
accompanying drawings, and the appended claims.<br>

BIEST MODE(S) FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
With reference to the FIG, 1, an anesthesia reversal system 10 according to the<br>
present invention, which maybe positioned along a portion of a breathing circuit 50,<br>
between an individual I and a Y connector 60, and includes a filter 20 and a rebreathing<br>
component 30. An inspiratay limb 52 and an expiratory limb 54 may be coupled to Y<br>
connector 60 and, thus, to breathing circuit 50. Notably, the inspiratory and expiratory<br>
limbs of some breathing circuits are coaxial. Nonetheless, the junction between the<br><br>
WO 2004/098688	PCT/US2004/012291<br>
-7 -<br>
inspiratory and expiratory hoses of such breathing circuits is still referred to as a "Y<br>
connector."<br>
As depicted, filter 20 is positioned near the endotracheal tube for an intubated<br>
patient or over the mouth and/or nose of an individual I when breathing through a mask<br>
or mouthpiece so as to remove exhaled anesthetic agents before they flow into the<br>
remainder of anesthesia reversal system 10, where they might otherwise be adsorbed by<br>
the surfaces of anesthesia reversal system to remove inhalation anesthetics anil be<br>
subsequently inhaled by the individual. Of course, placement of filter 20 at alternative<br>
locations of anesthesia reversal system 10 is also within the scope of the present<br>
invention, so long as filter 20 is positioned between the individual I and rebreathing<br>
component 30.<br>
Filter 20 may include a housing 22 with a proximal (relative to individual I)<br>
port 24 and a distal port 26, which, in the depicted example, are on opposite sides of<br>
filter 20. In addition, an anesthesia filter member 28 is contained within housing 22, in<br>
communication with both proximal port 24 and distal port 26.<br>
Proximal port 24 and distal port 26 may both be configured for connection to<br>
standard breathing circuit fittings. For example, proximal port 24 and distal port 26<br>
may be configured to connect to standard 15 mm or 22 mm respiratory fittings. As<br>
such, once reversal of general anesthesia or other inhaled anesthesia is desired, filter 20<br>
may be positioned along a breathing circuit 50 which is already in communication with<br>
an airway {Le., the mouth ornose, trachea, and lungs) of individual I.<br>
Anesthesia filter member 28 may comprise any type of filter which is known to<br>
selectively adsorb one or more types of anesthetic agents. By way of example and not<br>
to limit the scope of the present invention, anesthesia filter member 28 may comprise<br>
an activated charcoal, or activated carbon, filter, a crystalline silica molecular sieve, a<br>
lipid-based absorber (e.g., which operates in accordance with the teachings of U.S.<br>
Patent 4,878,388 to Loughlin et al., the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated<br>
herein in its entirety by this reference), a condensation-type filter, or any other type of<br>
filtering mechanism which captures or otherwise removes anesthetic vapors from the<br>
gases that have been exhaled by individual I. If filter member 28 comprises a<br>
paniculate material, such as activated charcoal or crystalline silica, the participate<br>
material may be contained by a porous member, a screen, or the like.<br><br>
WO 2004/098688	PCT/US2004/012291<br>
-8-<br>
As anesthesia filter member 28 communicates with both proximal port 24 and<br>
distal port 26, it will remove anesthetic agents from gases that are inhaled by<br>
individual I, as well as from gases that are exhaled by individual I.<br>
Optionally, filter 20 may also include an antimicrobial filter member 29 of a<br>
type known in the art, such as 3M FILTRETE filter media or other electrostatic<br>
polypropylene fiber based filter media. Like anesthesia filter member 28, antimicrobial<br>
filter member 29 communicates with breathing circuit 50 {e.g., by way of proximal<br>
port 24 and distal port 26 of filter 20). Accordingly, antimicrobial filter member 29 is<br>
positioned to receive substantially all of the gases that are inhaled and exhaled by<br>
individual 1 and, thus, to remove bacteria, viruses, or other pathogens from those gases.<br>
Of course, anesthesia reversal systems that include antimicrobial filters that are separate<br>
- from filter 20 are also within the scope of the present invention.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, filter 20 and rebreatning element 30 are in direct<br>
communication with one another. As will be shown in greater detail hereinafter,<br>
rebreathing element 30 may actually be a part of filter 20, rather than separate<br>
therefrom.<br>
Rebreathing element 30 may be configured to provide a volume or an amount of<br>
dead space which will maintain a particular level of CO2 in the blood (Le., PaCOa) of<br>
individual I. In the depicted example, rebreathing element 30 comprises a section 32 of<br>
expandable tubing that can be extended to increase or compressed to decrease the<br>
amount of dead space for containing previously exhaled gases which are to be<br>
rebreathed by individual I. Of course, other types of rebreathing apparatus, such as one<br>
of those (excepting the tracheal gas insufflation device) described in U.S.<br>
Patent 6,227,196, issued to On* et al., the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated<br>
herein in its entirety by this reference, or any other known type of partial rebreathing<br>
apparatus, may be.used in anesthesia reversal system 10 as rebreathing element 30.<br>
It is also within the scope of the present invention to include another element,<br>
such as a respiratory flow seasor or gas sampling port 40a therefor, or a capnometer or<br>
gas sampling port 40b therefor, as known in the art, at any position along an anesthesia<br>
reversal system 10 according to the present invention (., close to individual I,<br>
between filter 20 and rebrerfiing element 30, close to Y connector 60, etc.). For<br>
example, when gas sampling ports 40a, 40b are used, they may be of conventional<br>
configuration (e.g., for fad&amp;ating gas sampling at a rate of about 50 ml/min to about<br><br>
WO 2004/098688	PCT/US2004/012291<br>
-9-<br>
250 rnl/min), such as fittings that are configured to be disposed at an end or along the<br>
length of breathing circuit 50 or an inspiratory or expiratory limb 52,54 in<br>
communication therewith.<br>
Turning now to FIGs. 2 through 6, specific examples of anesthesia reversal<br>
systems that incorporate teachings of the present invention are shown.<br>
The embodiment of anesthesia reversal system 10' shown in FIG. 2 includes a<br>
rebreathing component 30' that comprises a section of rebreathing conduit 31', which<br>
communicates with breathing circuit 50 at two locations 34' and 35' between filter 20<br>
and Y connector 60. Rebreathing conduit 31' may include a section 32' which is<br>
volume-adjustable in a manner known in the art (e.g., by way of corrugations, etc.).<br>
One or more valves 36', flow restrictors 37', or a combination thereof may be<br>
positioned along breathing circuit 50 or rebreathing conduit 31' to control the flow of<br>
gases into and out of conduit 31'.<br>
Another embodiment of anesthesia reversal system 10", which is shown in<br>
FIG. 3, includes a rebreathing component 30" that communicates directly with a<br>
filter 20" rather than with breathing circuit 50. As shown, rebreathing component 30"<br>
may be configured as a loop of conduit 31". One or both ends 38" and 39" of<br>
conduit 31 may communicate with filter 20" at a location which is on the distal side of<br>
anesthesia filter member 28 relative to the location of individual I (FIG. 1) (e.g.y<br>
between anesthesia filter member 28 and distal port 26) such that are filtered gases<br>
before and/or after passage thereof through conduit 31". Like rebreathing<br>
component 30' (FIG. 2), rebreathing component 30" may include a volume-adjustable<br>
section 32".<br>
HG. 4 depicts another embodiment of anesthesia reversal system 10"', in which<br>
filter 20'" is configured to provide a dead space volume 30'" in which at least some<br>
carbon dioxide rich gases, are collected as individual I exhales. As shown, dead space<br>
volume 30'" is located on the distal side of anesthesia filter member 28, such that the<br>
exhaled gases that have collected therein are filtered as they flow therein and, later, as<br>
they are drawn therefrom {e.g., as individual I (FIG. 1) subsequently inhales).<br>
Yet another embodiment of anesthesia reversal system 10"" that incorporates<br>
teachings of the present invention is pictured in FIG. 5. Anesthesia reversal<br>
system 10"" is much like anesthesia reversal system 10'", which are shown in and<br>
described with reference toHG. 4. The primary difference between anesthesia reversal<br><br>
WO 2004/098688	PCT/US2004/012291<br>
-10-<br>
system 10'"' and anesthesia reversal system 10'" is that the dead space volume 30"" of<br>
anesthesia reversal system 10"", which is at least partially defied by body 22"" of<br>
filter 20"", is adjustable, for example, by enlarging or reducing the amount of space<br>
occupied by body 22"" (e.g., by the illustrated sliding motion or as otherwise will be<br>
readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art<br>
As another alternative, pictured in FIGs. 6A and 6B, an anesthesia reversal<br>
system 10'"" of the present invention may include one or more shunt lines 56'""<br>
positioned between an inspiratory limb 52'"" and an expiratory limb 54""' to provide a<br>
selectively sized dead space in the circuit. La this embodiment, inspiratory limb 52"'"<br>
and expiratory limb 54'"" act as part of the dead space. A two-way shunt valve 58'"" is<br>
positioned along each shunt line 56'"" to selectively direct the flow of inspired and<br>
expired gas.<br>
During normal or baseline breathing, as depicted in FIG. 6A, the two-way shunt<br>
valve 58'"" will be in a closed position and exhaled gases, which are represented by the<br>
shaded area, will enter the expiratory limb 54"".<br>
In order to facilitate rebreathing, as pictured in FIG. 6B, two-way shunt<br>
valve 58'"" is opened, permitting exhaled gases to fill a portion of inspiratory<br>
limb 52'"", substantially all of expiratory limb 54"'", and shunt line 56'"", all of which<br>
serve as dead space.<br>
The dead space may be rendered adjustably expandable by using expandable<br>
conduit for all or part of one or more of inspiratory limb 52'"", expiratory limb 54'"",<br>
and shunt line 56'"".<br>
Turning now to HGs. 7 and 8, use of an anesthesia reversal system 10 of the<br>
present invention in combination with various anesthesia delivery systems is shown.<br>
In FIG. 7, a circle system 70 is illustrated. Circle system 70, which includes an<br>
interconnected (e.g., in tjie configuration of a circle, or loop) inspiratory limb 52' and<br>
expiratory limb 54', Inspiratory limb 52' and expiratory limb 54' are coupled to a Y<br>
connector 60 which, in turn, is coupled to a breathing circuit 50'. Breathing circuit 50'<br>
is configured to interface with an individual I (FIG. 1) in a known manner (e.g., by<br>
intubation, with a mask, with a nasal cannula, etc.). Circle system also includes at least<br>
two one-way valves 72 and 74, which are positioned across inspiratory limb 52' and<br>
expiratory limb 54', respectively, at opposite sides of Y connector 60. One way<br>
valves 72 and 74 restrict the flow of gases through circle system 70 to a single<br><br>
WO 2004/098688	PCT/US2004/012291<br>
-11-<br>
direction, such that expired gases are prevented from flowing directly into inspiratory<br>
limb 52' and to prevent individual I from inhaling gases directly from expiratory<br>
limb 54'.<br>
Inspiratory limb 52' of circle system 70 includes at least one gas inlet 75, such<br>
as a port that facilitates coupling to an anesthesia delivery system 300, a mechanical<br>
ventilator, or a breathing bag, or which permits air from an environment external to<br>
circle system 70 {e.g., an operating room, a patient room in a hospital, etc.) to flow<br>
therein. An expiratory element 76, such as an expiratory spill valve of a known type is<br>
positioned along expiratory limb 54' of circle system 70.<br>
As shown, expiratory limb 54' and expiratory limb 52' are joined at a location<br>
which is distal relative to Y connector 60 and individual I by a carbon dioxide removal<br>
element 77, such as a soda lime canister. As one-way valve 72 prevents exhaled gases<br>
entering inspiratory limb 52', the exhaled gases are directed through expiratory limb 54'<br>
and, depending upon the positioning of a bypass valve 78 positioned along expiratory<br>
limb 54', possibly into carbon dioxide removal element 77, which reduces the amount<br>
of carbon dioxide present in such gases.<br>
Additionally, circle system 70 includes an anesthesia reversal system 10. As<br>
shown, anesthesia reversal system selectively communicates, by way of bypass<br>
valve 78, with expiratory limb 54' of circle system 70 and is positioned in parallel to<br>
carbon dioxide removal element 77. The volume of dead space that may be present<br>
within circle system 70 depends upon whether or not expiratory element 76 causes<br>
exhaled gases to remain within expiratory limb 54' and upon whether bypass valve 78<br>
is positioned to permit exhaled gases to bypass carbon dioxide removal element 77. In<br>
addition, when a mechanical ventilator is coupled to gas inlet 75, the volume of dead<br>
space within circle system TO depends upon the proximity of the gas inlet 75 to a<br>
junction 80 of anesthesia,reversal system 10 with inspiratory limb 52'.<br>
If expiratory element 76 is at least partially closed, depending upon the<br>
positioning of bypass valve 78, at least some of the gases that have been exhaled by<br>
individual I and which are flowing through expiratory limb 54' may be diverted from<br>
carbon dioxide removal element 77 into anesthesia reversal system 10. If bypass<br>
valve 78 is adjustable to more than two positions, exhaled gases may be directed into<br>
both anesthesia reversal system 10 and carbon dioxide removal element 77. Thus, it<br>
may be possible to carefullyiegulate the amounts of exhaled gases that are directed into<br><br>
WO 2004/098688	PCT/US2004/012291<br>
-12-<br>
anesthesia reversal system 10 and carbon dioxide removal element 77, providing<br>
control over the amount of carbon dioxide that is rebreathed by individual L Further, if<br>
bypass valve 78 is positioned such that the previously exhaled gases flow through<br>
anesthesia reversal system 10, the amount of carbon dioxide that remains in gases that<br>
pass through anesthesia reversal system 10 will be relatively high, while the amount of<br>
anesthesia present in such gases will be reduced by filter 20.<br>
Then, when individual I inhales or is caused to inhale, at least a portion of the<br>
gases that are inhaled {i.e., the gases that remain within breathing circuit 50' and<br>
anesthesia reversal system 10) will be previously exhaled, CO2-rich gases.<br>
As circle system 70 may itself serve as a dead space from which an individual I<br>
may be caused to rebreathe previously exhaled, carbon dioxide rich gases, an anesthesia<br>
reversal system 10 that is used in a circle system 70 may lack additional dead space,<br>
such as a rebreathing element 30.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 8, a Bain system 90 that incorporates teachings of the<br>
present invention is depicted. Bam system 90 includes a linear breathing circuit 50", a<br>
patient interface 92 located at one end 51" of breathing circuit 50", and a fresh gas<br>
inlet 94, which is configured to communicate with an anesthesia delivery system 300 of<br>
a known type, a mechanical ventilator, a breathing bag, or the environment external to<br>
Bain system 90, positioned along the length of breathing circuit 50". In addition, Bain<br>
system 90 includes an anesthesia reversal system 10 that communicates with breathing<br>
circuit 50". Anesthesia reversal system 10 is preferably positioned proximate to patient<br>
interface 92 so as to optimize the amount of anesthesia removed from the exhaled gases<br>
and, thus, rninimize the amount of anesthetic agent rebreathed by an individual I as the<br>
affects of the anesthesia are being reversed.<br>
While FIGs. 2 througfe 8 illustrate various systems that are useful for providing<br>
a dead space volume from vrtjich an individual I may rebreathe as individual I is being<br>
withdrawn from anesthesia, any other method, apparatus, or system that induces<br>
rebreathing of carbon dioxide in a mechanical breathing circuit for the purpose of<br>
reversing the affects of anesthesia on an individual is also within the scope of the<br>
present invention.<br>
Turning now to FIG. 9, an anesthesia reversal system 110 that includes a carbon<br>
dioxide infusion element 130 rather than a rebreathing component is depicted. As<br>
illustrated, carbon dioxide infusion element 130 communicates with a breathing<br><br>
WO 2004/098688	PCT/US2004/012291<br>
-13-<br>
conduit 150. A filter 120 of anesthesia reversal system 110 is also positioned along<br>
breathing conduit 150, proximate to individual I (FIG. 1), so as to reduce that the<br>
amount of anesthesia in gases that are exhaled by individual I and, thus, to minimize<br>
the amount of anesthesia that remains in any gases that are withdrawn from breathing<br>
conduit 150 and rebreathed by individual L<br>
With returned reference to FIG. 1 (although anesthesia reversal system 110<br>
shown in and described with reference to FIG. 9 may be used in a similar manner),<br>
anesthesia reversal system 10 may be used by placing the same in communication with<br>
a breathing circuit or anesthesia delivery circuit (e.g., those shown in FIGs. 7 and 8). It<br>
is currently preferred that filter 20 be positioned proximate to individual I and that<br>
rebreathing element 30 be positioned closer to Y connector 60. In the case of<br>
anesthesia recovery system 110 (FIG. 9), the position of carbon dioxide infusion<br>
element 130 relative to that of filter 120 is irrelevant<br>
A dead space (eg., in the form of the volume within a rebreathing element 30)<br>
may be adjusted by an anesthetist to provide the desired volume of dead space therein<br>
in order to facilitate rebreathing. For example, when the dead space volume is at least<br>
partially located within corrugated tubing, the dead space volume may be adjusted by<br>
extending or contracting the length of the corrugated tubing. As another example,<br>
when a fixed volume of dead space is present, or even with a volume-adjustable dead<br>
space, the amount of carbon dioxide within the dead space may be tailored by adjusting<br>
the flow of "fresh" gases, including recycled gas from which carbon dioxide has been<br>
removed. When the flow of "fresh" gases is lower than the flow of individual Ps<br>
ventilation, rebreathing of gases within the dead space may occur.<br>
Once anesthesia reversal system 10 has been positioned in communication with<br>
i a breathing circuit or anesthesia delivery system, gases that are exhaled by individual I<br>
pass into and through filter 20, which removes at least some anesthetic agents from the<br>
exhaled gases. At least a portion of the volume of the filtered, exhaled gases enters and<br>
at temporarily remains wifliin the dead space (,, rebreathing element 30). Also, by<br>
reducing levels of anesthetic agents in gases that are exhaled by individual I, filter 20<br>
may effectively reduce levels of anesthetic agents that escape into the environment<br>
(e.g.f the operating room, recovery room, atmosphere, etc.) when individual I exhales.<br>
When individual I inhales, at least a portion of the inhaled gases are drawn from<br>
the dead space (e.g., from inbreathing element 30), with any other gases being drawn<br><br>
WO 2004/098688	PCT/US2004/012291<br>
-14-<br>
from either the air or from a source of inspiratory gases that communicate with a<br>
ventilator. As the inhaled gases are drawn through breathing circuit, they pass through<br>
filter 20, where at least some of the remaining anesthetic agents therein are removed<br>
therefrom. Notably, in most anesthesia systems, very high concentrations of oxygen (&gt;<br>
90%) are used. Thus, individual I may rebreathe the same gas many times and still be<br>
sufficiently oxygenated.<br>
It is currently preferred that partial rebreathing processes (i.e., only a portion of<br>
the gases inhaled by the patient were previously exhaled, while the other portion of<br>
gases are "fresh") be used in reversing the effects of inhaled anesthesia. This is<br>
because individual I requires some oxygen during the reversal. Of course, the use of<br>
total rebreathing processes is also within the scope of the invention. The manner in<br>
which rebreathing is effected may be varied or controlled to provide the desired affects,<br>
while providing individual I with sufficient oxygen.<br>
Of course, a gas sensor and monitor 210 (e.g., an anesthetic gas monitor of a<br>
known type) that measures carbon dioxide or oxygen may be used to monitor the<br>
ventilatory gases of individual I. A respiratory flow sensor and monitor 212 may also<br>
be used to monitor the flow of ventilation of individual I. Gas concentrations may be<br>
determined by a processing element 220 (e.g., a computer processor or controller, a<br>
smaller group of logic circuits, etc:) that communicates with gas sensor and<br>
monitor 210 and flow sensor and monitor 212, as known in the art. If the carbon<br>
dioxide or oxygen levels (e.g.f blood gas content, respiratory fraction, etc.) reach<br>
undesirable levels, adjustments may be made to the dead space volume (e.g., within<br>
rebreathing element 30), or volume of rebreathed gases, to the concentration of oxygen<br>
or carbon dioxide in the other inhaled gases, or to any combination of the foregoing.<br>
Such adjustment may be made automatically, such as by processing element 220,<br>
which, of course, operates under control of appropriate programming and<br>
communicates with one or more of a ventilator, valves (e.g.t bypass valve 78 (FIG. 7))<br>
of the anesthesia reversal system 10. Alternatively, adjustment of the dead space may<br>
be effected semiautomaticaHy, such as in accordance with instructions provided by a<br>
processing element, or manually.<br>
By combining a filter 20 and an element for increasing the amount of carbon<br>
dioxide inhaled by individual I (e.g., with a rebreathing element 30 or carbon dioxide<br>
infusion element 130) in an anesthesia reversal apparatus of the present invention,<br><br>
WO 2004/098688	PCT/US2004/012291<br>
-15-<br>
ventilation of an individual I may be increased while maintaining normal to high PaCO2<br>
levels, which maintains or increases blood flow levels and, thus, the rate at which<br>
anesthetic agents may be removed from the brain as the increased ventilation improves<br>
the rate at which anesthetic agents are removed from the blood and, thus, exhaled by<br>
individual I.<br>
While much of the description provided herein focuses on the reversal of<br>
general anesthesia, it should be appreciated that the apparatus and methods of the<br>
present invention are useful for reversing the effects of any type of inhaled anesthesia,<br>
whether or not such inhaled anesthetic agents have a general anesthetic effect.<br>
Although the foregoing description contains many specifics, these should not be<br>
construed as limiting the scope of the present invention, but merely as providing<br>
illustrations of some of the presently preferred embodiments. Similarly, other<br>
embodiments of the invention may be devised which do not depart from the spirit or<br>
scope of the present invention. Features from different embodiments may be employed<br>
in combination. The scope of the invention is, therefore, indicated and limited only by<br>
the appended claims and their legal equivalents, rather than by the foregoing<br>
description. All additions, deletions and modifications to the invention as disclosed<br>
herein which fall within the meaning and scope of the claims are to be embraced<br>
