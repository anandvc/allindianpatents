BACKGROUND<br>
Throughout this specification, including any claims which follow, unless the context<br>
requires otherwise, the word "comprise," and variations such as "comprises" and<br>
"comprising," will be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated integer or step or group<br>
of integers or steps, but not the exclusion of any other integer or step or group of integers<br>
or steps.<br>
It must be noted that, as used in the specification and any appended claims, the singular<br>
forms "a," "an," and "the" include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates<br>
otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to "a pharmaceutical carrier" includes mixtures of<br>
two or more such carriers, and the like.<br>
Ranges are often expressed herein as from "about" one particular value, and/or to "about"<br>
another particular value. When such a range is expressed, another embodiment includes<br>
from the one particular value and/or to the other particular value. Similarly, when values<br>
are expressed as approximations, by the use of the antecedent "about," it will be<br>
understood that the particular value forms another embodiment.<br>

Methythioninium Chloride (MTC) (also known as Methylene Blue)<br>
Methythioninium Chloride (MTC) (also known as Methylene blue (MB); methylthionine<br>
chloride; tetramethylthionine chloride; 3,7-bis(dimethylamino) phenothiazin-5-ium chloride;<br>
C.I. Basic Blue 9; tetramethylthionine chloride; 3,7-bis(dimethylamino) phenazathionium<br>
chloride; Swiss blue; C.I. 52015; C.I. Solvent Blue 8; aniline violet; and Urolene Blue®) is<br>
a low molecular weight (319.86), water soluble, tricyclic organic compound of the following<br>
formula:<br><br>
Methythioninium Chloride (MTC) (also known as Methylene Blue), perhaps the most well<br>
known phenothiazine dye and redox indicator, has also been used as an optical probe of<br>
biophysical systems, as an intercalator in nanoporous materials, as a redox mediator, and<br>
in photoelectrochomic imaging.<br>
See, for example, Colour Index (Vol. 4, 3rd edition, 1971) and Lillie et al., 1979, and<br>
references cited therein.<br>
MTC was first described in a German Patent in 1877 (Badische Anilin- und Soda-Fabrik,<br>
1877). In that patent, MTC was synthesized by nitrosylation of dimethylaniline,<br>
subsequent reduction to form N,N-dimethyl-1,4-diaminobenzene, and subsequent<br>
oxidative coupling in the presence of hydrogen sulphide (H2S) and iron(lll) chloride<br>
(FeCI3).<br>
Bernthsen described subsequent studies of MTC and methods for its synthesis (see<br>
Bernthsen, 1885a, 1885b, 1889).<br>
Fierz-David and Blangley, 1949, also describes methods for the synthesis of MTC from<br>
dimethylaniline, as illustrated in the following scheme<br>
3<br><br><br><br>
In step (a), nitrosodimethylaniline is prepared from dimethylaniline by treatment with nitrite<br>
(NaNO2) in aqueous acid (HCI) solution. In step (b), the nitroso compound is reduced to<br>
form p-aminodimethylaniline in aqueous acid (HCI) solution using zinc dust solution. In<br>
steps (c), (d), and (e), the p-aminodimethylaniline is oxidized in aqueous acid solution with<br>
another molecule of dimethylaniline, and simultaneously a thiosulfonic acid group is<br>
introduced; the ring is then closed using manganese dioxide or copper sulfate. More<br>
specifically, a clear neutral solution of p-aminodimethylaniline is acidified (H2SO4), and a<br>
non-reducing zinc chloride solution is added (ZnCI2 with Na2Cr207). Aluminium thiosulfate<br>
(AI2(S2O3)3) and sodium thiosulfate (Na2S2O3) are added. Sodium dichromate (Na2Cr2O7)<br>
is added. The mixture is heated and aerated. Dimethylaniline is added. Sodium<br>
dichromate (Na2Cr207) is added. The mixture is heated, and becomes dark greenish-blue<br>
in colour due to the formation of the thiosulfonic acid of Bindschedler green. Manganese<br>
dioxide or copper sulfate is added, and the mixture heated, and the dye precipitates from<br>
the concentrated zinc chloride solution.<br>
Very similar synthesis methods are described in the Colour Index (Vol. 4, 3rd edition,<br>
1971), p. 4470.<br>
Masuya et al., 1992, describe certain phenothiazine derivatives, and methods for their<br>
preparation and use in photodynamic therapy of cancer and in immunoassays utilizing<br>
chemiluminescence. The compounds are prepared by routes similar to those discussed<br>
above.<br>
4<br><br>
Leventis et al., 1997, describe methods for the synthesis of certain MTC analogs, which<br>
employ phenothiazine as a starting material and which add the desired 3,7-substituents<br>
by halogenation followed by amination. The authors assert that MTC is synthesized<br>
commercially by oxidation pf N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylene diamine with Na2Cr207 in the<br>
presence of Na2S2O3, followed by further oxidation in the presence of N,N-dimethylamine.<br>
Marshall and Lewis, 1975a, describes the purification of commercial MTC and Azure B by<br>
solvent extraction and crystallisation. They assert that aqueous MTC/Azure B mixtures at<br>
a buffered pH of 9.5 can be separated by extraction with carbon tetrachloride. The carbon<br>
tetrachloride removes the Azure B while leaving the MTC in the aqueous layer. They<br>
further assert that low temperature crystallisation of MTC at a concentration of 0.25 N with<br>
hydrochloric acid removes metal contaminants. However, the organic purity analysis<br>
reported therein is based on thin-layer chromatography, which is not suitable for<br>
quantification. Also, the microanalysis for sulphated ash does not indicate a metal free<br>
sample. (The preferred technique in 1975 was atomic absorption.)<br>
Marshall and Lewis, 1975b, describes the analysis of metal contaminants in commercial<br>
thiazine dyes by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. They report 38 samples with<br>
metal concentrations that vary widely between 0.02% and 25.35% of individual samples;<br>
the metals examined were iron, potassium, sodium and zinc. They also report that other<br>
metals may be present which were not analysed. Aluminium, chromium, manganese, and<br>
copper, are all involved in synthetic procedures for MTC and are almost certain to be<br>
present. Importantly, they report large variations in the metal content of commercial<br>
samples of MTC.<br>
Lohr et al., 1975, describes the purification of Azure B by column chromatography,<br>
specifically by separation to isolate the desired product followed by ion exchange back to<br>
the chloride. They assert that other cationic dyes such as MTC can be purified by this<br>
method. However, column chromatography is not a suitable method for the purification of<br>
MTC on a large scale.<br>
Fierz-David et al., 1949, describes the synthesis of the zinc chloride double salt of MTC<br>
and the removal of zinc by chelation with sodium carbonate followed by filtration to<br>
generate zinc free methylene blue. However, the authors acknowledge that this<br>
technique cannot be used on a large scale, because the yields are poor.<br>
MTC is currently used to treat methemoglobinemia (a condition that occurs when the<br>
blood cannot deliver oxygen where it is needed in the body). MTC is also used as a<br>
medical dye (for example, to stain certain parts of the body before or during surgery);<br>
a diagnostic (for example, as an indicator dye to detect certain compounds present in<br>
urine); a mild urinary antiseptic; a stimulant to mucous surfaces; a treatment and<br>
preventative for kidney stones; and in the diagnosis and treatment of melanoma.<br>
5<br><br>
MTC has been used to treat malaria either singly (Guttmann &amp; Ehrlich, 1891) or in<br>
combination with chloroquine (Schirmer et al. 2003; Rengelhausen et al. 2004).<br>
Malaria in humans is caused by one of four protozoan species of the genus Plasmodium:<br>
P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale, or P. malariae. All species are transmitted by the bite of<br>
an infected female Anopheles mosquito. Occasionally, transmission occurs by blood<br>
transfusion, organ transplantation, needle-sharing, or congenitally from mother to fetus.<br>
Malaria causes 300-500 million infections worldwide and approximately 1 million deaths<br>
annually. Drug resistance, however is a major concern and is greatest for P. falciparum,<br>
the species that accounts for almost all malaria-related deaths. Drugs or drug<br>
combinations that are currently recommended for prophylaxis of malaria include<br>
chloroquine/proguanil hydrochloride, mefloquine, doxycycline and primaquine.<br>
MTC (under the name Virostat, from Bioenvision Inc., New York) has shown potent<br>
viricidal activity in vitro. Specifically Virostat is effective against viruses such as HIV and<br>
West Nile Virus in laboratory tests. West Nile virus (WNV) is a potentially serious illness<br>
affecting the central nervous system. The large majority of infected people will show no<br>
visible symptoms or mild flu-like symptoms such as fever and headache. About one in 150<br>
will develop severe symptoms including tremors, convulsions, muscle weakness, vision<br>
loss, numbness, paralysis or coma. Generally, WNV is spread by the bite of an infected<br>
mosquito, but can also spread through blood transfusions, organ transplants,<br>
breastfeeding or during pregnancy from mother to child. Virostat is also currently in<br>
clinical trials for the treatment of chronic Hepatitis C. Hepatitis C is a viral infection of the<br>
liver. The virus, HCV, is a major cause of acute hepatitis and chronic liver disease,<br>
including cirrhosis and liver cancer. HCV is spread primarily by direct contact with human<br>
blood. The major causes of HCV infection worldwide are use of unscreened blood<br>
transfusions, and re-use of needles and syringes that have not been adequately sterilized.<br>
The World Health Organization has declared hepatitis C a global health problem, with<br>
approximately 3% of the world's population infected with HCV and it varies considerably<br>
by region. The prevalence in the US is estimated at 1.3% or approximately 3.5 million<br>
people. Egypt has a population of approximately 62 million and contains the highest<br>
prevalence of hepatitis C in the world, estimated at over 20% of the nation's<br>
approximately 62 million people.<br>
MTC, when combined with light, can prevent the replication of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA).<br>
Plasma, platelets and red blood cells do not contain nuclear DNA or RNA. When MTC is<br>
introduced into the blood components, it crosses bacterial cell walls or viral membrane<br>
6<br><br><br>
then moves into the interior of the nucleic acid structure. When activated with light, the<br>
compounds then bind to the nucleic acid of the viral or bacterial pathogen, preventing<br>
replication of the DNA or RNA. Because MTC designed to inactivate pathogens, it has the<br>
potential to reduce the risk of transmission of pathogens that would remain undetected by<br>
testing.<br>
MTC and derivatives thereof (e.g., "diaminophenothiazinium compounds") have been<br>
found to be useful in the treatment of tauopathies (such as, for example, Alzheimer's<br>
disease) (see, for example, Wischik, C.M., et al., 1996, 2002).<br>
Oral and parenteral formulations of MTC are commercially available in the United States,<br>
usually under the name Urolene Blue®. However, these formulations contain substantial<br>
amounts of metal impurities. These impurities are highly undesirable, and many (e.g.,<br>
including Al, Cr, Fe, Cu) exceed the safety limits set by European health agencies.<br>
Consequently, there is a great need for higher purity (e.g., pharmaceutical grade purity,<br>
e.g., a purity safe for human consumption, e.g., with low or reduced metal content)<br>
diaminophenothiazinium compounds, including MTC.<br>
The inventors have developed methods for the synthesis of diaminophenothiazinium<br>
compounds (including MTC), that yield products with extremely high purity and in<br>
particular, products with extremely low levels of undesired impurities (both organic and<br>
metal) that meet (and often exceed) the safety limits set by European health agencies<br>
(e.g., the European Pharmacopoeia).<br>
Without exaggeration, MTC prepared by the methods described herein is the purest<br>
available worldwide.<br>

Synthesis Method A<br>
One important difference between known methods and the presently claimed Method A is<br>
the step of isolation and purification of the zwitterionic intermediate, 6 (IAPOZI). This step<br>
of isolation and purification gives rise to improved yield in the subsequent ring closure<br>
step (due to, inter alia, improved stability of the zwitterionic intermediate and reduced side<br>
reactions), as well as improved purity of the final diaminophenothiazinium compound. In<br>
conventional methods, the zwitterionic intermediate is not isolated, and the reaction<br>
mixture is used, unchanged, in the subsequent step.<br>
Another important difference between known methods and the presently claimed<br>
Method A is the step of Cr(VI) reduction. Cr(VI) is used (at least) in the oxidative coupling<br>
step. Residual Cr(VI) presents several serious problems. First, high levels of highly toxic<br>
contaminants such as residual Cr(VI) are unacceptable in products destined for use in<br>
pharmacy. By reducing residual Cr(VI) to Cr(lll), which is a much less toxic form,<br>
pharmaceutical standards can more easily be satisfied. Second, residual Cr(VI)<br>
destabilizes the zwitterionic intermediate and impedes the subsequent ring closure (RC)<br>
step, and thus reduces the yield of the final diaminophenothiazinium compound. By<br>
reducing residual Cr(VI) to Cr(lll), the yield of the final diaminophenothiazinium compound<br>
is greatly increased.<br>
In addition, chromium can more easily be removed when in the form of Cr(lll) than when<br>
in the form of Cr(VI). By reducing residual Cr(VI) to Cr(lll), it is possible to obtain a<br>
product with very low levels of residual chromium.<br>
Another important difference between known methods and the presently claimed<br>
Method A is the treatment step, that is, treatment of the chloride salt with one or more of<br>
sulphide (ST), dimethyldithiocarbamate (DT), carbonate (CT), ethylenediaminetetraacetic<br>
acid (EDTAT), or an organic solvent (OE). This additional step (or these additional steps)<br>
greatly improves the purity of the diaminophenothiazinium compound.<br>

formulation.<br>

interchangeably herein to mean the formation of a solid precipitate (e.g., crystals) from a<br>
solution or suspension, and that "re-" in the term "recrystallisation" does not require that<br>
the newly crystallised product was previously in a solid or crystalline form.<br>

Synthesis Method B<br>
One important difference between the known methods and the presently claimed<br>
Method B is the use of sodium sulphide (Na2S) instead of other sulphides, such as<br>
hydrogen sulphide (H2S) in the ring fusion (RF-2) step. See, for example, Michaelis et al.,<br>
1940. However, hydrogen sulphide is extremely dangerous and is both difficult and<br>
expensive to use in an industrial process. By using sodium sulphide, these<br>
disadvantages are overcome. In addition, sodium sulphide is a solid, is easier to handle,<br>
and can be weighed more easily and accurately; this permits better control of the reaction.<br>

sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of the subject in<br>
question (e.g., human) without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other<br>
problem or complication, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. Each carrier,<br>
diluent, excipient, etc. must also be "acceptable" in the sense of being compatible with the<br>
other ingredients of the formulation.<br>
The formulations may be prepared by any methods well known in the art of pharmacy.<br>
Such methods include the step of bringing into association the active compound with a<br>
carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general, the formulations<br>
are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active compound<br>
with carriers (e.g., liquid carriers, finely divided solid carrier, etc.), and then shaping the<br>
product, if necessary.<br>
The formulation may be prepared to provide for rapid or slow release; immediate,<br>
delayed, timed, or sustained release; or a combination thereof.<br>
Formulations suitable for parenteral administration (e.g., by injection), include aqueous or<br>
non-aqueous, isotonic, pyrogen-free, sterile liquids (e.g., solutions, suspensions), in which<br>
theactive ingredient is dissolved, suspended, or otherwise provided (e.g., in a liposome or<br>
other microparticulate). Such liquids may additional contain other pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable ingredients, such as anti-oxidants, buffers, preservatives, stabilisers,<br>
bacteriostats, suspending agents, thickening agents, and solutes which render the<br>
formulation isotonic with the blood (or other relevant bodily fluid) of the intended recipient.<br>
Examples of excipients include, for example, water, alcohols, polyols, glycerol, vegetable<br>
oils, and the like. Examples of suitable isotonic carriers for use in such formulations<br>
include Sodium Chloride Injection, Ringer's Solution, or Lactated Ringer's Injection.<br>
Typically, the concentration of the active ingredient in the liquid is from about 1 ng/ml to<br>
about 10 μg/ml, for example from about 10 ng/ml to about 1 μg/ml. The formulations may<br>
be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose sealed containers, for example, ampoules and<br>
vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilised) condition requiring only the<br>
addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example water for injections, immediately prior to<br>
use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile<br>
powders, granules, and tablets.<br>

Examples of Preferred Formulations<br>
One aspect of the present invention pertains to a dosage unit (e.g., a pharmaceutical<br>
tablet or capsule) comprising 20 to 300 mg of a diaminophenothiazinium compound as<br>
described herein (e.g., obtained by, or obtainable by, a method as described herein;<br>
having a purity as described herein; etc.), and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier,<br>
diluent, or excipient.<br>
In one embodiment, the dosage unit is a tablet.<br>
In one embodiment, the dosage unit is a capsule.<br>
In one embodiment, the amount is 30 to 200 mg.<br>
In one embodiment, the amount is about 30 mg.<br>
In one embodiment, the amount is about 60 mg.<br>
In one embodiment, the amount is about 100 mg.<br>
In one embodiment, the amount is about 150 mg.<br>
In one embodiment, the amount is about 200 mg.<br>
In one embodiment, the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent, or excipient is or<br>
comprises one or both of a glyceride (e.g., Gelucire 44/14 ®; lauroyl macrogol-32<br>
glycerides PhEur, USP) and colloidal silicon dioxide (e.g., 2% Aerosil 200 ®; Colliodal<br>
Silicon Dioxide PhEur, USP).<br>
Dosage<br>
It will be appreciated by one of skill in the art that appropriate dosages of the<br>
diaminophenothiazinium compound, and compositions comprising the<br>
diaminophenothiazinium compound, can vary from patient to patient. Determining the<br>
optimal dosage will generally involve the balancing of the level of therapeutic benefit<br>
against any risk or deleterious side effects. The selected dosage level will depend on a<br>
variety of factors including, but not limited to, the activity of the particular compound, the<br>
route of administration, the time of administration, the rate of excretion of the compound,<br>
the duration of the treatment, other drugs, compounds, and/or materials used in<br>
combination, the severity of the condition, and the species, sex, age, weight, condition,<br>
general health, and prior medical history of the patient. The amount of compound and<br>
route of administration will ultimately be at the discretion of the physician, veterinarian, or<br>
clinician, although generally the dosage will be selected to achieve local concentrations at<br>
the site of action which achieve the desired effect without causing substantial harmful or<br>
deleterious side-effects.<br>
Administration can be effected in one dose, continuously or intermittently (e.g., in divided<br>
doses at appropriate intervals) throughout the course of treatment. Methods of<br>
determining the most effective means and dosage of administration are well known to<br>
67<br><br>
those of skill in the art and will vary with the formulation used for therapy, the purpose of<br>
the therapy, the target cell(s) being treated, and the subject being treated. Single or<br>
multiple administrations can be carried out with the dose level and pattern being selected<br>
by the treating physician, veterinarian, or clinician.<br>
In general, a suitable dose of the active compound is in the range of about 100 ng to<br>
about 25 mg (more typically about 1 μg to about 10 mg) per kilogram body weight of the<br>
subject per day. Where the active compound is a salt, an ester, an amide, a prodrug, or<br>
the like, the amount administered is calculated on the basis of the parent compound and<br>
so the actual weight to be used is increased proportionately.<br>
In one embodiment, the active compound (e.g., MTC) is administered to a human patient<br>
according to the following dosage regime: about 100 mg, 3 times daily.<br>
In one embodiment, the active compound (e.g., MTC) is administered to a human patient<br>
according to the following dosage regime: about 150 mg, 2 times daily.<br>
In one embodiment, the active compound (e.g., MTC) is administered to a human patient<br>
according to the following dosage regime: about 200 mg, 2 times daily.<br>

65°C. The mixture was filtered. The residue was washed with water (4 x 100 cm3). The<br>
filtrate was collected. The filtrate was treated with sodium chloride (NaCI, MW 57.96, 120<br>
73<br><br>
g, 2.07 mol). The mixture was stirred until the deep blue colour disappeared. The mixture<br>
was filtered to provide crude methylthioninium chloride (MTC) as a solid (7.48 g, 29%).<br>
The crude product was optionally subjected to further treatment (e.g., with sodium<br>
sulphide, etc.), as described in Examples 9 to 13, and then optionally (further) purified by<br>
recrystallisation, as described in Examples 14 and 15.<br>
Example 7<br>
				Methylthionium Chloride (MTC)<br>
		 3-Pot Synthesis using Hydrosulfite with Isolation of Intermediate<br>
To a round bottom flask (RBF) was added /V,N-dimethylaniline (C6H5N(CH3)2, MW 121.2,<br>
20 g, 0.165 mol) and water (200 cm3) to form a heterogeneous mixture. The mixture was<br>
cooled to ~5°C. To the cooled mixture was added HCI (37%, 44 cm3) over a 10-15 minute<br>
period. To this mixture was added dropwise an aqueous solution of sodium nitrite<br>
(NaNO2, MW 69.0, 12.6 g, 0.183 mol) in water (100 cm3) over a 20-30 minute period. The<br>
resulting suspension was stirred at a low temperature (~5°C) for 1 hour. The mixture was<br>
maintained at ~5°C and HCI (37%, 44 cm3) was added over a 5-10 minute period. After<br>
an additional 5 minutes of stirring, iron fillings (Fe, MW 55.85, 22.0 g, 0.40 mol) were<br>
added over a 15-20 minute periods, in order to maintain a reaction temperature below<br>
30°C during the addition. The mixture was stirred for 2 hours at a temperature of ~10°C.<br>
The mixture was filtered. The solid residue was washed with water (20 cm3) and the<br>
filtrate collected.<br>
The filtrate was cooled to approximately 5°C within a 10-15 minute period. The filtrate<br>
was treated with a solution of sodium thiosulphate (Na2S2O3.5H2O, MW 248.2, 45.0 g,<br>
0.181 mol) in water (50 cm3) as one aliquot in a quick addition. A solution of sodium<br>
dichromate dihydrate (Na2Cr2O7.2H2O, MW 298.0, 20.0 g, 67.1 mmol) in water (80 cm3)<br>
was added dropwise over a 40 minute period. The solution was then stirred at low<br>
temperature (about 5°C) for 1 hour. A chilled (~5°C) homogenous solution of<br>
A/,/V-dimethylaniline (C6H5N(CH3)2&gt; MW 121.2, 20 g, 0.165 mol), water (20 cm3) and<br>
H2SO4 (98%, 16 g) was then added to the chilled reaction mixture as one aliquot, at once.<br>
(Preparation of the solution prior to addition: N,N-dimethylaniline and water were cooled in<br>
an ice bath to approximately 5°C, and then concentrated sulphuric acid was slowly added<br>
over a 15-25 minute period in order to prevent thermal run away of the exothermic<br>
reaction.) Then, a solution of sodium dichromate dihydrate (Na2Cr2O7.2H20, MW 298.0,<br>
52.0 g, 0.174 mmol) in water (140 cm3) was added dropwise over a 90 minute period.<br>
The reaction mixture was stirred at approximately 5CC for 2 hours. A solution of sodium<br>
hydrosulfite (Na2S2O4, MW 174.1,15.2 g, 87.2 mmol) in H2O (20 cm3) was added to the<br>
mixture as one aliquot in one quick addition. The mixture was stirred for another 10<br>
minutes (at about 5°C). The resulting green-brown suspension was filtered. The residue<br>
was washed with water (2 x 250 cm3) to provide a green solid. The solid was air-dried<br>
overnight.<br>
74<br><br>
The solid was added to an aqueous HCI solution (900 cm3, pH 2) to form a suspension.<br>
Copper (II) sulfate pentahydrate (CuSO4.5H2O, MW 249.7, 4.12 g, 16.5 mmol) was added<br>
as one aliquot in a quick addition. The temperature was increased to 85°C over a 15-20<br>
minute period. The mixture was stirred at this temperature for 1 hour. A deep blue colour<br>
was formed. The mixture was cooled to room temperature over a 30 minute period, and<br>
the mixture was filtered. (In an alternative example, the mixture was filtered at about<br>
60°C; however, the filtrate can bump under the reduced vacuum.) The residue was<br>
washed with water (2 x 200 cm3). The filtrate was collected. The filtrate was heated to<br>
65°C over a 25-30 minute period. The (hot) filtrate was treated with sodium chloride<br>
(NaCI, MW 57.96, 200 g, 3.45 mol), and allowed to cool to 22°C over a 3.5 hour period.<br>
Crystalline product was first observed after about 2.5 hours and at about 40°C. The<br>
mixture was filtered to provide crude methylthionium chloride (MTC) as a solid (On this<br>
scale: 18-24 g or 35%; on a 5 L scale: 60-65 g or &gt;30%).<br>
The crude product was optionally subjected to further treatment (e.g., with sodium<br>
sulphide, etc.), as described in Examples 9 to 13, and then optionally (further) purified by<br>
recrystallisation, as described in Examples 14 and 15.<br>

3-Pot Synthesis with Isolation of Intermediate<br>
To a round bottom flask (RBF) was added N,N-dimethylaniline (C6H5N(CH3)2, MW 121.2,<br>
10 g, 82.15 mmol), water (100 cm3), and HCI (37%, 22 cm3). The mixture was cooled to<br>
~5°C. To this mixture was added dropwise an aqueous solution of sodium nitrite (NaNO2,<br>
MW 69.0, 6.3 g, 90.8 mmol) in water (50 cm3). The resulting suspension was stirred at a<br>
low temperature (5-10cC) for 1 hour. The mixture was cooled to approximately 5°C. Iron<br>
fillings (Fe, MW 55.85, 11.0 g, 197 mmol) and HCI (37%, 22 cm3) were added in one<br>
aliquot portions. The mixture was stirred for 2 hours at a temperature below 30°C. The<br>
mixture was filtered, and the filtrate collected.<br>
The filtrate was cooled to approximately 5°C. The filtrate was treated with a solution of<br>
sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate (Na2S2O3.5H2O, MW 248.2, 22.52 g, 90.75 mmol) in<br>
water (25 cm3). A solution of sodium dichromate dihydrate (Na2Cr2O7.2H2O, MW 298.0,<br>
10.0 g, 33.6 mmol) in water (20 cm3) was added dropwise over a 20 minute period. The<br>
solution was then stirred at low temperature (about 5°C) for 1 hour. A homogenous<br>
solution of N,N-dimethylaniline (C6H5N(CH3)2, MW 121.2, 10 g, 82.15 mmol), water (10<br>
cm3) and H2SO4 (98%, 8 g) was then added to the chilled solution. Then, a solution of<br>
sodium dichromate dihydrate (Na2Cr2O7.2H2O, MW 298.0, 26.15 g, 87.7 mmol) in water<br>
(35 cm3) was added dropwise over a 25 minute period. The mixture was stirred at<br>
approximately 5°C for 2 hours. The resulting green-brown suspension was filtered. The<br>
75<br><br>
residue was washed with water (4 x 250 cm3) and tetrahydrofuran (THF) (100 cm3) to<br>
provide a green solid. The solid was air-dried overnight.<br>
The solid was added to an aqueous HCI solution (455 cm3, pH 2) of copper (II) sulfate<br>
pentahydrate (CuSO45H2O, MW 249.7, 2.06 g, 8.25 mmol). The temperature was<br>
increased to 85°C. The mixture was stirred at this temperature for 1 hour. A deep blue<br>
colour was formed. The mixture was cooled to room temperature. The mixture was<br>
filtered. The residue was washed with water (4 x 100 cm3). The filtrate was collected.<br>
The filtrate was treated with sodium chloride (NaCI, MW 57.96, 100 g, 1.73 mol). The<br>
mixture was stirred until the deep blue colour disappeared. The mixture was filtered to<br>
provide crude methylthioninium chloride (MTC) as a solid (15.3 g, 58%).<br>
The crude product was optionally subjected to further treatment (e.g., with sodium<br>
sulphide, etc.), as described in Examples 9 to 13, and then optionally (further) purified by<br>
recrystallisation, as described in Examples 14 and 15.<br>
Example 9<br>
Treatment of Crude Product with Sodium Sulphide<br>
Crude MTC product (MW 373.90, 4.5 g, -12.0 mmol) was fully dissolved in H2O (125 cm3)<br>
at 65°C. The solution was cooled to room temperature. The cooled solution was clarified<br>
by filtration to ensure complete dissolution. The solution was treated with a solution of<br>
sodium sulphide (Na2S, MW 78.04, &gt;60%, 200 mg, 1.54 mmol, 0.1 equivalent) in H2O (10<br>
cm3). The resulting mixture was stirred for 10 minutes. The mixture was filtered by<br>
vacuum filtration. The filtrate was collected. Sodium chloride (NaCI, MW 57.96, 16 g,<br>
0.276 mol) was added to the filtrate while stirring. The resulting precipitate was collected<br>
by vacuum filtration.<br>
Example 10<br>
Treatment of Crude Product with Sodium Sulphide<br>
Crude MTC product (MW 373.90, 5 g, ~13.3 mmol) was fully dissolved in H2O (230 cm3)<br>
at 60°C. The solution was cooled to room temperature. The solution was treated with a<br>
solution of sodium sulphide (Na2S, MW 78.04, &gt;60%, 135 mg, -1.0 mmol, -0.07<br>
equivalent) in H2O (20 cm3). The resulting mixture was stirred for 15 minutes. The<br>
mixture was filtered by vacuum filtration. The filtrate was collected. The pH of the filtrate<br>
was 10.5 ± 0.5. The filtrate was washed with dichloromethane (DCM) (5 x 100 cm3). The<br>
pH of the washed filtrate was adjusted from ~9.5-10.2 to 5.0. The solution was then<br>
heated to 60°C. Sodium chloride (NaCI, MW 57.96, 200 g, 3.45 mol) was slowly added to<br>
the (hot) solution. (Caution must be exercised because residual DCM may cause the<br>
solution to bump.) Slow cooling (in excess of 3.5 hours) caused methylthioninium chloride<br>
(MTC) to precipitate in a highly crystalline form. The precipitate was collected by vacuum<br>
filtration and dried in an oven at 60°C.<br>

Example 17<br>
Methylthioninium Chloride (MTC)<br>
The Synthesis, Treatment, and Recrystallisation of MTC<br>
N,N-Dimethylaniline (20.0 g, 165 mmol) was placed in the reaction vessel [V1] and stirred.<br>
To this vessel was added H2O (200 cm3) in one aliquot over 1 minute, and the<br>
heterogeneous mixture was cooled to 5°C (± 2°C) over a 15 minute period (± 5 minutes)<br>
using an ice/water bath. 37% Hydrochloric acid (44 cm3) was added over a 5 minute<br>
period (± 2 minutes) with an observable temperature rise from 4°C to 8°C (± 2°C).<br>
(Caution: exothermic reaction.) The reaction vessel was maintained at 5°C (± 2°C) for an<br>
additional 5 minutes period (+ 2 minutes) to ensure a complete homogenous mixture.<br>
Stirring was continuous throughout this process.<br>
Separately the NaNO2 solution was prepared. NaNO2 (12.6 g, 182.6 mmol) was quickly<br>
added over 1 minute to a separate flask containing stirred H2O (100 cm3). The resulting<br>
dissolving process is endothermic and a temperature drop from 20°C to 17°C (± 2°C) was<br>
observed. The complete dissolution took 5 minutes (± 2 minutes). An overall volume of<br>
approximately 110 cm3 resulted.<br>
The sodium nitrite solution was slowly added dropwise to the reaction vessel [V1] over a<br>
20 minute period (± 5 minutes) and a rise in reaction temperature from 5° to 9°C was<br>
observed during the addition. (Caution: exothermic reaction.) An orange colour was<br>
observed once the addition began. The reaction mixture was stirred for an additional<br>
60 minutes (+ 5 minutes) whilst maintaining the temperature at 5°C (± 2°C) using the<br>
78<br><br>
ice/water bath. At this stage in the reaction, an orange solution with a lighter coloured<br>
precipitate was observed. A small amount of foam was also formed.<br>
37% Hydrochloric acid (44 cm3) was added to the reaction mixture [V1] over a 5 minute<br>
period (± 2 minutes) with an observable reaction temperature rise from 5°C to 8°C.<br>
(Caution: exothermic reaction.) The reaction mixture was stirred for another 5 minutes<br>
(± 2 minutes) once addition was complete. Iron fillings (22.0 g, 0.394 mol) were added to<br>
the reaction vessel in aliquots of approximately 2 g over a period of 15 minutes<br>
(+ 5 minutes). A temperature rise from 8°C to 12°C was observed during the iron<br>
addition. (Caution: exothermic reaction.) (Caution: orange fumes are formed; gas is<br>
evolved.) The reaction mixture was stirred for an additional 120 minutes (± 10 minutes),<br>
whilst a reaction temperature of approximately 10°C (+ 2°C) was maintained using the<br>
ice/water bath.<br>
The excess iron fillings were collected by vacuum filtration over Celite® over a 5 minute<br>
period (± 2 minutes), and the remaining solid in the filter funnel was washed with H2O<br>
(20 cm3).<br>
The filtrate (a clear brown liquid) was retained and contained the desired N,N-dimethyl-p-<br>
phenylenediamine dihydrochloride salt. The total volume of filtrate was approximately<br>
400 cm3. The pH of the solution at this stage was 2.59 at 20°C. The solution was<br>
monitored using ultraviolet spectrophotometry throughout the reaction in order to confirm<br>
reaction completion and to calculate the final concentration of the N,N-dimethyl-p-<br>
phenylenediamine. Typical conversion was 82% ± 2%).<br>
The filtrate was placed in another reaction vessel [V2] and cooled to 5°C (± 2°C) over a<br>
period of 15 minutes (± 5 minutes) using an ice/water bath.<br>
Separately a solution of Na2S2O3.5H2O was prepared. Na2S2O3.5H2O (45.0 g,<br>
181.4 mmol) was added in one aliquot to stirred H2O (50 cm3) over one minute. The<br>
resulting dissolution was endothermic and a temperature drop from 22°C to 10°C was<br>
observed. This mixture was then stirred for 15 minutes (± 5 minutes) to ensure complete<br>
dissolution. An overall volume of 76 cm3 resulted.<br>
The Na2S2O3.5H2O solution was added in one aliquot over a 1 minute period to the<br>
reaction mixture in [V2]. The reaction mixture was stirred for an additional 5 minutes<br>
(± 2 minutes) while maintaining the reaction temperature at 5°C (+ 2°C).<br>
Separately a solution of Na2CrzO7.2H2O was prepared. Na2Cr207.2H20 (20.0 g,<br>
67.2 mmol) was added to stirred H2O (80 cm3) over one minute as one aliquot. The<br>
resulting dissolution was endothermic and a temperature drop from 22°C to 15°C. The<br>
mixture was then stirred for 15 minutes (± 5 minutes) to ensure complete dissolution. The<br>
79<br><br>
Na2Cr2O7.2H2O solution was added slowly to the reaction mixture in [V2] over a 30 minute<br>
period (± 5 minutes), in order to maintain a reaction temperature of 5°C to 8°C (± 2°C).<br>
(Caution: exothermic reaction.) The reaction mixture was then stirred for 60 minutes<br>
whilst maintaining the reaction temperature at 5°C (± 2°C) using an ice/water bath.<br>
Separately a solution of N,N-dimethvlaniline was prepared. N,N-Dimethylaniline (20.0 g,<br>
165 mmol) was added in one aliquot over 1 minute to a flask containing stirred H2O<br>
(20 cm3). The heterogeneous mixture was cooled to 5°C (+ 2°C) over 15 minutes (± 5<br>
minutes) using an ice/water bath, and concentrated (98%) sulphuric acid (16.0 g) was<br>
slowly added over a 25 minute period (± 5 minutes) to prevent a rapid temperature rise.<br>
A temperature rise from 3°C to 21 °C was observed. (Caution: exothermic reaction.)<br>
Upon completion of the acid addition, the mixture was stirred for a further 10 minutes<br>
(± 5 minutes) to ensure a complete homogenous mixture. This mixture was maintained at<br>
5°C (+ 2°C) until addition to the main reaction vessel [V2]. The overall volume was<br>
approximately 48 cm3.<br>
The chilled acidified aqueous N,N-dimethylaniline mixture at 5°C (± 2°C) was added to the<br>
reaction mixture in [V2] as one aliquot over a 1 minute period. The reaction mixture was<br>
then stirred for another 5 minutes (± 2 minutes) whilst being maintained at 5°C (± 2°C).<br>
No temperature changes were observed with this addition to the main reaction mixture.<br>
Separately a Na2Cr2Or2H2O solution was prepared. Na2Cr2O7.2H2O (52.0 g,<br>
174.4 mmol) was added to a flask containing stirred H2O (140 cm3) over a 1 minute<br>
period.<br>
The Na2Cr207.2H20 solution was added dropwise to the reaction mixture in [V2] over a<br>
90 minute period (± 2 minutes), resulting in a temperature rise in the reaction from 5°C to<br>
10°C (± 2°C). (Caution: exothermic reaction.) A green precipitate was formed upon<br>
addition of the Na2Cr207.2H20 solution. The reaction mixture was stirred for 120 minutes<br>
whilst being maintained at 5°C (± 2°C). The reaction mixture now resembled a dark green<br>
slurry. The thiosulphonic acid of Bindschedler Green is the green precipitate in the<br>
solution at this stage. The waste effluent (filtrate) was monitored at this point to determine<br>
the levels of chromium(VI). By titration with ammonium iron(ll) sulphate (0.1 M) in the<br>
presence of perchloric acid and sulphuric acid, the levels of Cr(VI) can be calculated so<br>
that the effluent can be treated appropriately.<br>
Separately a solution of Na2S2O4 was prepared. Na2S2O4 (15.2 g, 87.2 mmol) was added<br>
to a flask containing stirred H2O (20 cm3) in one aliquot over a 1 minute period. This<br>
mixture was stirred for an additional 30 minutes (+ 5 minutes) to ensure complete<br>
dissolution.<br>
80<br><br>
The Na2S2O4 solution was added to the reaction mixture [V2] as one aliquot over a<br>
1 minute period, during which no temperature changes were observed. After completion<br>
of this addition, the reaction mixture was left to stir for a further 5 minutes (± 2 minutes).<br>
The reaction mixture in [V2] was then filtered through a Buchner funnel under vacuum<br>
over a 30 minute period (± 5 minutes). The solid was removed from the filter funnel and<br>
placed in a new vessel with addition of fresh water (250 cm3). This mixture was<br>
vigorously stirred for 15 minutes and filtered. The solid was again removed from the filter<br>
funnel, placed in a separate vessel with fresh water (250 cm3), stirred, and filtered. All<br>
washings were discarded.<br>
The solid thiosulphonic acid of Bindschedler Green collected in the filter funnel was<br>
broken up into small pieces and placed in a new clean reaction vessel [V3].<br>
Separately H2O (900 cm3) was pH adjusted to pH 2.0 (± 0.2) using 5 cm3 (± 1 cm3) 5 M<br>
hydrochloric acid. This acidified water was then added to the reaction vessel containing<br>
the thiosulphonic acid of Bindschedler Green in [V3] over a 1 minute period. The content<br>
of this vessel [V3] was then stirred. The thiosulphonic acid of Bindschedler Green was<br>
suspended in the acidified water [V3]. To this suspension [V3] was added CuSO4.5H2O<br>
(4.0 g, 16.0 mmol) in one aliquot over a 1 minute period. No exothermic reaction was<br>
observed on this scale. The reaction vessel [V3] was then heated to 85°C (± 2°C) over a<br>
25 minute period (± 5 minutes). A blue colour was first observed at 40°C (+ 2°C). Once<br>
85°C (± 2°C) had been achieved, the reaction vessel [V3], stirring was continued at this<br>
temperature for 60 minutes. The vessel [V3] was then cooled over a 20 minute period<br>
(± 5 minutes) to 60°C (± 2°C) and the contents were filtered through a Buchner funnel<br>
under vacuum over a 20 minute period (± 5 minutes). The solid was then washed with<br>
fresh water (200 cm3). The solid waste was discarded safely. Because approximately<br>
68 g waste solid (dry weight of solid waste) was observed on a 10 g scale, approximately<br>
146 g waste solid was anticipated. The water washing and filtrate were combined and<br>
were ready for purification. The filtrate and washing contain the desired MTC in solution.<br>
The deep blue aqueous filtrate containing the MTC was heated to 65°C (± 2°C) over a<br>
25 minute period (± 5 minutes) and sodium chloride (200 g, 342 mmol) was added over a<br>
10 minute period (± 2 minutes). The solution was cooled to 25°C (± 2°C) over a<br>
360 minute period (+ 5 minutes) to yield the product as a blue green solid. (Total crude<br>
mass of 24.1 g, approximately 40%.)<br>
Alternatively: Hydrochloric acid (15 cm3, 5 M) was added to the deep blue aqueous filtrate<br>
containing the MTC, currently at 25°C, over a 10 minute period (± 2 minutes) in order to<br>
reach pH 1; this generated a suspension. The suspension was heated to 65°C (± 2°C)<br>
over a 25 minute (± 5 minutes) and was cooled to 20°C (+ 2°C) over a 360 minute period<br>
(± 5 minutes) to yield the product as a blue green solid. (Total crude mass of 24.1 g,<br>
81<br><br>
approximately 40%.) Even this relatively crude product usually has a lower metal content<br>
purer than commercially available MTC.<br>
Alternatively: The MTC was then crystallised out of solution by the slow addition of<br>
hydrochloric acid (1 M) to reach pH 1. The solid MTC was collected by filtration. Any<br>
residual MTC in the filtrate can be recovered with the addition of NaCI.<br>
The product was then subjected to treatment and organic extraction.<br>
MTC (5 g, obtained from the procedure described above) was placed in a vessel,<br>
containing water (230 cm3), and heated to 65°C (± 5°C) over a 20 minute period<br>
(± 5 minutes) with stirring. Stirring was continued at this temperature for an additional<br>
1 hour (± 10 minutes), and the reaction mixture was then cooled to 10°C (± 2°C) over a<br>
30 minute period (± 5 minutes).<br>
Separately a solution of Na2S was prepared. Sodium sulphide (135 mg) was fully<br>
dissolved in water (20 cm3) over a 10 minute period (± 5 minutes) whilst being stirred.<br>
(Sodium sulphide has a strong repugnant smell.)<br>
The cooled MTC solution at 10°C (± 2°C) was treated with the prepared sodium sulphide<br>
solution in one aliquot, at once. The combined solutions were stirred for 15 minutes<br>
(± 5 minutes) while maintaining a temperature of 10°C (± 2°C) and then the resulting<br>
precipitate was removed by filtration. (This removes the complexed metals.) The metal-<br>
free MTC is now present in solution in the filtrate liquor.<br>
The pH of the MTC filtrate was approximately 10.8, and if not, it was adjusted to have a<br>
pH of approximately 10.8 using aqeous Na2S solution. The cool MTC solution at 10°C<br>
(± 2°C) was placed in a reaction vessel equipped with an overhead mechanical stirrer<br>
attached to a shaft with a paddle as well as a run-off tap at the bottom of the flask. Once<br>
the MTC solution (filtrate liquor) was in the vessel, dichloromethane (50 cm3) (Caution:<br>
Non-flammable,volatile) is also added to the same vessel and the heterogeneous mixture<br>
was stirred for 10 minutes. (The dichloromethane is immiscible in water and forms a<br>
separate layer below the water layer containing the MTC.) The lower dichloromethane<br>
layer was run-off once separated from the aqueous MTC layer. (The interface is<br>
impossible to see; however, the DCM layer is purple and once it has come out of the tap,<br>
a clear distinction can be made between that and the dark blue/black aqueous MTC<br>
layer.) This addition of dichloromethane, 10 minute stir, and run-off of the lower layer,<br>
was repeated four more times, and the temperature was maintained at 10°C (± 2°C)<br>
throughout this extraction process. (The Azure B is removed with the DCM.) The total<br>
volume of dichloromethane was 250 cm3.<br>
The deep blue top MTC aqueous layer was now pH adjusted from 9.9 to 5.0 using 10%<br>
hydrochloric acid. The MTC solution was then heated to 65°C (+ 5°C) over a 20 minute<br>
82<br><br>
period (± 5 minutes), whilst stirred. Sodium chloride (42 g) was added to the MTC<br>
solution, followed immediately by cooling to 25°C (± 2°C) over a 360 minute period<br>
(± 5 minutes). The metal-free highly pure MTC precipitated out of solution and was<br>
recovered by filtration to give a blue green solid (4.7-4.9 g, 96% ± 2%).<br>
Alternatively: Hydrochloric acid (15 cm3, 5 M) was added to the deep blue top MTC<br>
aqueous layer over a 10 minute period (± 2 minutes) in order to reach pH 1; this<br>
generated a suspension. The suspension was heated to 65°C (± 2°C) over a 25 minute<br>
period (+5 minutes) and was cooled to 20°C (+ 2°C) over a 360 minute period<br>
(± 5 minutes) to yield metal-free highly pure MTC as a blue green solid.<br>
Alternatively: The deep blue top MTC aqueous layer was pH adjusted to between<br>
pH 3.5-4.5 and the temperature allowed to rise to 25°C. The MTC was then crystallised<br>
out of solution by slow addition of hydrochloric acid (1 M) to reach pH 1. The solid MTC<br>
was collected by filtration to yield metal-free highly pure MTC as a blue green solid. Any<br>
residual MTC in the filtrate can be recovered with the addition of NaCI.<br>
An MTC sample was prepared using the method described in Example 1. The crude<br>
product (CM-pd-378) was then crystallised using cool acid re-crystallisation as described<br>
in Example 17. The material was then further purified by organic extraction and<br>
recrystallised using HCI at 25°C, also as described in Example 17. This yielded highly<br>
pure MTC with an organic purity of 98.53% based upon HPLC analyses. The purity data<br>
are summarised in the following Table.<br><br>

Ethylthioninium Chloride (ETC) Zinc Chloride (Double Salt)<br>
Synthesis using Manganese Dioxide<br>
A stirred mixture of N,N-diethyl-p-phenylenediamine ((CH3CH2)NC6H4NH2, MW 164.25,<br>
5.0 g, 30.4 mmol) in H2O (100 cm3) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4, concentrated, "98%", 1 cm3)<br>
was treated with non-reducing zinc chloride solution (ZnCI2, MW 136.29, 7.60 g, 55 mmol,<br>
in 15 cm3 of H2O with Na2Cr2O7·2H20, MW 298.00, 100 mg, 0.3 mmol) to produce a<br>
reddish reaction mixture.<br>
Additions of a solution of AI2(SO4)3.16H2O (5.80 g, 9.2 mmol) in H2O (10 cm3); a solution<br>
of sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate (Na2S2O3·5H2O, MW 248.18, 8.0 g, 32.2 mmol) in H2O<br>
(10 cm3); and one-third of a solution of sodium dichromate dihydrate (Na2Cr2O7·2H2O,<br>

Quantitative Analysis of Metals<br>
Comparision of Obtained Product with Urolene Blue®<br>
Quantitative analysis was performed on a commercially obtained sample of Urolene<br>
Blue® as well as a sample of the high purity MTC product obtained using the methods<br>
described herein. MTC ("Obtained Product") was obtained by nitrosylation of<br>
N,N-dimethylaniline, followed by nitrosyl reduction, thiosulphonic acid formation, oxidative<br>
coupling, Cr(VI) reduction using hydrosulfite, ring closure, and chloride salt formation<br>
using cold NaCI. This gave crude MTC, which was further purified by sodium sulphide<br>
treatment, followed by chloride salt formation using cold NaCI. Analysis was performed<br>
using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) (using an Agilent 7500®<br>
instrument, with and without reaction cell mode (H2)). Samples were prepared according<br>
to the standard sample preparation protocol. 10 ppb rhodium was used as an internal<br>
standard. The data are summarized in the following table.<br><br>

As can be seen from the data, Urolene Blue® exceeds (and in some cases, greatly<br>
exceeds) the European safety limits for several metals, including Al, Cr, Fe, Cu, whereas<br>
87<br><br>
the high purity MTC product obtained using the methods described herein not only meet<br>
these standards, but have substantially lower levels of these and other metals.<br>

mixing vessel. The MTC (screened through a 600 urn sieve) and Aerosil 200 ® were<br>
added and mixed until the mixture was homogeneous. The mixture was degassed by<br>
applying a vacuum for approximately 15 minutes and then transferred to the hopper (set<br>
at a temperature of approximately 55°C) of a capsule-filling machine. Hard gelatin<br>
capsules (from Capsugel) were filled and the target fill weight checked at frequent<br>
intervals (approximately 30 minute intervals). The capsules were then transferred to a<br>
banding machine. A gelatin banding solution (gelatin in purified water) was prepared.<br>
The capsules were banded on the banding machine with inspection on-line for bubbles<br>
and incomplete seals. The capsules were then passed through a drying oven at 25 to<br>
30°C.<br>

Dated this 18th day of April 2007.<br><br>
This invention pertains generally to the field of chemical synthesis and purification, and<br>
more specifically to methods of synthesizing and purifying certain 3,7-diamino-<br>
phenothiazin-5-ium compounds (referred to herein as "diaminophenothiazinium<br>
compounds") including Methythioninium Chloride (MTC) (also known as Methylene Blue).<br>
In one embodiment, the method comprises the steps of, in order: nitrosylation (NOS);<br>
nitrosyl reduction (NR); thiosulfonic acid formation (TSAF); oxidative coupling (OC); Cr(VI)<br>
reduction (CR); isolation and purification of zwitterionic intermediate (IAPOZI); ring closure<br>
(RC); chloride salt formation (CSF); one of: sulphide treatment (ST);<br>
dimethyldithiocarbamate treatment (DT); carbonate treatment (CT);<br>
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid treatment (EDTAT); organic extraction (OE); and<br>
recrystallisation (RX). The present invention also pertains to the resulting (high purity)<br>
compounds, compositions comprising them (e.g., tablets, capsules), and their use in<br>
methods of inactivating pathogens, and methods of medical treatment and diagnosis, etc.,<br>
for example, for tauopathies, Alzheimer's disease (AD), skin cancer, melanoma, viral<br>
diseases, bacterial diseases, or protozoal diseases.</td>
