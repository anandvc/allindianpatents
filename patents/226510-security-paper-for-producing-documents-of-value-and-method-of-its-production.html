				<td>"SECURITY PAPER FOR PRODUCING DOCUMENTS OF VALUE,<br>
AND METHOD OF ITS PRODUCTION"<br>
This invention relates to a security paper for producing documents of value, such<br>
as bank notes, certificates, etc., with at least one multilayer security element having at<br>
least one visually checkable optical effect, the security element being disposed at least<br>
partly on the surface of the security paper. The invention further relates to a multilayer<br>
security element and to a document of value with such a security element. A transfer<br>
material for applying a multilayer security element to a document of value and a<br>
method for producing the transfer material and the document of value are also the sub-<br>
ject matter of the invention.<br>
There is a constant interest in protecting papers of value against forgery and un-<br>
authorized reproduction. It is becoming ever more difficult, particularly in view of to-<br>
day's copying and printing techniques, to find effective security features that at least<br>
make unauthorized reproduction or forgery clearly recognizable, if they do not actually<br>
prevent it.<br>
EP 0019 191 B1 proposes for example providing a paper of value with an inte-<br>
grated circuit in which a checkable coding is written, the communication with the inte-<br>
grated circuit preferably being effected contactlessly via antennas. The integrated cir-<br>
cuit is set in the gap of an at least partly metalized carrier foil. This foil is then lami-<br>
nated between two paper webs. Since the carrier foil is only laminated in between the<br>
two paper webs, however, there is the danger that the layers can be separated from<br>
each other relatively easily so that the plastic inlay provided with the chip can be used<br>
for possible forgeries. Further, this security element is a strictly machine-checkable<br>
security element that can only be checked by means of special detectors.<br>
Frequently used authenticity features that are very easily visually checked and<br>
very striking are optically variable security elements, for example holograms, that<br>
show different visual impressions, such as color effects or information, from different<br>
viewing angles. A paper of value with such a security element is known from EP 0 440<br>
045 A2. A bank note is described here that is provided with a label-like hologram.<br>
Since the optically variable effect of the hologram cannot be rendered by a color cop-<br>
ier, these security elements offer very good protection against color copying. However,<br><br>
However, these security elements have the disadvantage that they are very poorly<br>
checkable by machine, since the radiation reflected by the diffraction structures of the<br>
hologram must be detected at certain solid angles and the influence of stray radiation<br>
largely excluded to permit reliable ascertainment of the presence of a certain<br>
hologram. A further problem is the fluctuating signal intensity, since the latter is<br>
greatly dependent on the illumination source of the hologram. For reliable measure-<br>
ment, defined lighting conditions must therefore be ensured.<br>
To avoid this problem, it was therefore also proposed to superimpose a visually<br>
readily visible hologram with a strictly machine-readable laser transmission hologram<br>
(DE 38 40 037 C2). Readout of the machine-readable hologram can be effected only<br>
by means of a laser, the information hidden in this laser transmission hologram being<br>
projected onto a certain space coordinate in front of the document of value that is al-<br>
ready defined when the hologram is recorded. The detector must be located at this<br>
place to permit this hidden information to be recognized. However, this type of visual<br>
and machine protection for a document of value is very elaborate both to produce and<br>
to check.<br>
The invention is therefore based on the problem of proposing a document of<br>
value and a security paper with a security element having a visually checkable optical<br>
effect and also being checkable by machine, the security paper and document of value<br>
being preferably easy and cost-effective to produce.<br>
This problem is solved by the features of the independent claims. Developments<br>
are the subject matter of the subclaims.<br>
According to the invention, "security paper" designates the unprinted paper that<br>
can have not only the inventive security element but also further authenticity features,<br>
such as luminescent substances provided in the volume, a security thread or the like. It<br>
is usually present in quasi endless form and is processed further at a later time.<br>
"Document of value" refers to a document that is finished for its intended use. It<br>
may be for example a printed paper of value, such as a bank note, certificate or the<br>
like, an ID card, a passport or another document requiring protection.<br><br>
The invention will be described hereinafter with reference to the security paper.<br>
However, the advantages and embodiments apply analogously to documents of value.<br>
According to the invention, the security paper is provided with at least one multi-<br>
layer security element having an optical effect that can be easily checked visually and<br>
not rendered by copying technology, or only in falsified form. This security element is<br>
disposed at least partly on the surface of the security paper and contains at least one<br>
integrated circuit in one of its inside layers. This integrated circuit is for example a<br>
strict memory chip (ROM), a rewritable chip (EPROM, EEPROM) or a microproces-<br>
sor chip. The chips used have a thickness of 5 microns to 50 microns, preferably 10 mi-<br>
crons, and an edge length of about 0.1 millimeters to 3 millimeters, preferably 0.6 mil-<br>
limeters. On the chip there are preferably two to four contact surfaces.<br>
The optical effect of the security element can be produced by a layer containing<br>
optically variable pigments, in particular interference-layer or liquid-crystal pigments.<br>
This layer can be present all over or in the form of information. Alternatively, the se-<br>
curity element can also have a hologram, kinegram or other diffraction structure. Pref-<br>
erably, the diffraction structures are embossed into a plastic layer in the form of a re-<br>
lief structure. If the diffraction structures are to be observable in reflected light, they<br>
are combined with a reflecting layer, in particular a metal layer or a dielectric layer<br>
with a high refractive index. The reflecting layer need not be provided all over, how-<br>
ever, but can be applied in the form of a screen or any other information. In particular,<br>
it can have gaps in the form of patterns or characters. A further possibility for produc-<br>
ing a visually checkable optical effect is to use thin-film structures wherein metallic<br>
and/or dielectric layers with different refractive indexes are disposed one above the<br>
other, the layers cooperating so that different visual impressions arise at different<br>
viewing angles at least when viewed in reflected light. These different visual impres-<br>
sions are preferably different color effects.<br>
Alternatively, the optical effect can also be produced by any printed image or a<br>
metallic layer with gaps in the form of patterns, characters or the like. The metal layer<br>
itself can likewise be present in the form of characters or patterns. The use of special<br><br>
printing inks, such as luminescent inks, is also possible. Of course, a plurality of secu-<br>
rity features producing an optical effect can also be used. When a layer producing an<br>
optical effect is spoken of below, this also refers to cooperating multilayer structures,<br>
such as the abovementioned dielectric thin-film elements or combinations of a plural-<br>
ity of layers that produce different optical effects. The term "hologram" is likewise<br>
intended to stand for any diffraction structures.<br>
The inventive integrated circuit is preferably disposed between this layer having<br>
the optical effect and the security paper. It is thus protected outwardly from environ-<br>
mental influences and practically does not appear visually. It is advantageous to use<br>
integrated circuits with which communication is effected contactlessly via a coupling<br>
element. The coupling element can already be an integrated part of the integrated cir-<br>
cuit or be disposed in a layer of the security element. Integration of the coupling ele-<br>
ment into the layer structure of the security element involves the advantage that in case<br>
of attempted manipulation or forgery the circuit cannot be separated operably from an<br>
original security element or a security paper equipped therewith, for example to be<br>
incorporated into a counterfeit reproduction. The coupling element can be a folded<br>
dipole, a coil or an open dipole. To increase the effectiveness of the system, the folded<br>
dipole or the coil can also have a metalized core zone. If the coupling element is<br>
formed on the layer producing the optical effect, the filled core zone also causes the<br>
visual impression of the layer to be less disturbingly influenced by the coupling ele-<br>
ment. The read range is between about 0.1 millimeters and a few centimeters depend-<br>
ing on the type of coupling element and the selected read/write frequency, for example<br>
13.56 megahertz and 2 gigahertz.<br>
The inventive security element is preferably applied to the security paper after<br>
papermaking and is so connected with the security paper that it cannot be removed<br>
without destroying the security paper or the security element. The invention thus has<br>
the advantage that the security element does not have to be integrated into the paper-<br>
making process and is nevertheless connected with the paper of value in forgery-proof<br>
fashion. A further advantage is that the security element is protected against attempts<br>
at forgery in several respects. The optical effect of the layers facing the viewer cannot<br>
be rendered true to the original with copying machines or other reproduction tech-<br><br>
reproduction techniques, so that such attempts at forgery can already be visually<br>
recognized easily and fast. If an attempt to reproduce or imitate the optical impression<br>
of the security element should succeed, however, the forgery can nevertheless be<br>
recognized upon the machine check of the integrated circuit. Since the circuit is<br>
disposed inside the security element and covered by the layers producing the optical<br>
effect, a potential forger will not notice this additional authenticity feature and<br>
therefore not attempt to imitate it.<br>
The inventive security element is preferably formed as a multilayer self-support-<br>
ing label or as a transfer element that is connected with the security paper after its pro-<br>
duction. The contour form of the security element is freely selectable. Alternatively,<br>
the secuirity element can also be formed as a security thread. In this case, the integrated<br>
circuit and the layer producing the optical effect are disposed on a thread-shaped plas-<br>
tic substrate that is so incorporated into the paper web during papermaking that the<br>
thread passes directly to the surface of the security paper in partial areas. According to<br>
a preferred embodiment, the security thread consists of two plastic substrates between<br>
which the integrated circuit and the layer producing the optical effect are disposed.<br>
A "transfer element" refers according to the invention to a security element that<br>
is prepared on a separate carrier layer, for example a plastic foil, in the reverse order as<br>
it later comes to lie on the security paper, and then transferred to the security paper by<br>
means of an adhesive or lacquer layer in the desired contour forms. The carrier layer<br>
can be removed from the layer structure of the security element after transfer, or re-<br>
main a firm part of the security element on the layer structure as a protective layer.<br>
The individual transfer elements can be prepared on the carrier layer as separate<br>
individual elements in the contour forms to be transferred. Alternatively, the layer se-<br>
quence of the transfer elements is provided on the carrier layer in continuous form.<br>
Such carrier layers with spaced-apart individual transfer elements or a continuously<br>
extending layer structure will hereinafter be referred to as "transfer material," and the<br>
layer sequence of the security element disposed on the carrier layer as the "transfer<br>
layer."<br><br>
In the case of the continuous transfer layer, the transfer material is then con-<br>
nected with the security paper via an adhesive layer, and the adhesive layer activated<br>
via suitable embossing tools so that the transfer layer adheres to the security paper<br>
only in the activated areas. All other areas are then removed with the carrier layer. Al-<br>
ternatively, the adhesive layer can also be executed in the form of the security element<br>
to be transferred. Adhesives preferably used are hot-melt adhesives. However, any<br>
other adhesives, such as reaction lacquers, can also be used.<br>
The security element can alternatively be applied to the document of value. The<br>
embodiments and fastening possibilities described in connection with the security pa-<br>
per apply analogously in this case.<br>
Hereinafter, some preferred layer sequences of the inventive security element<br>
will be explained in more detail by the example of the transfer material.<br>
The analogous layer sequence, only in the accordingly reverse order of layers,<br>
can of course also be used for labels and security threads.<br>
In the simplest form, the transfer material consists of a carrier layer, in particular<br>
a transparent plastic foil, at least one layer producing the optical effect and at least one<br>
integrated circuit. In this embodiment the integrated circuit also contains the coupling<br>
element for communication with a read/write device.<br>
If an integrated circuit not having an integrated coupling element is used, a suit-<br>
able coupling element must be provided in the layer structure of the transfer layer of<br>
the transfer material. The transfer layer with the integrated coupling element is then<br>
preferably formed as a thin, non-self-supporting foil. This thwarts attempts at forgery<br>
that aim at detaching the original security element from a security paper, since the<br>
non-self-supporting security element is not removable without being damaged.<br>
This coupling element can be an open dipole, a folded dipole or a coil. This cou-<br>
pling element is preferably produced by suitable demetalizings in a metal layer. For<br>
this purpose the carrier layer of the transfer material, which is optionally provided with<br>
a separation layer, is provided with the layer producing the optical effect. On this layer<br><br>
layer a water-soluble or other layer soluble by means of a solvent is then printed in the<br>
form of the areas to be demetalized. In the next step, the carrier layer is metalized com-<br>
pletely on the printed side. In a last step, the soluble ink and the metalization present in<br>
these areas are removed. The integrated circuit is fastened to this layer by means of a<br>
conductive adhesive layer, for example conductive silver or an anisotropic conductive<br>
adhesive. Finally, the carrier layer is provided with an adhesive layer at least in certain<br>
areas.<br>
Alternatively, the structuring of the metal layer can also be effected by means of<br>
known etching techniques. In this connection, the carrier layer is provided directly<br>
with the all-over metalization after application of the layer producing the optical ef-<br>
fect. The metal layer is then printed with a protective lacquer layer in the form of the<br>
desired coupling element. The non-covered areas are then removed with suitable sol-<br>
vents. The protective layer can also be produced by photographic means by coating the<br>
metal layer all over with a photoresist that is then exposed and developed.<br>
According to a variant, the metallic layer forming the coupling element can be<br>
separated from the layer producing the optical effect by an insulating layer. This is<br>
necessary in particular when the layer producing the optical effect likewise has a con-<br>
ductive layer.<br>
According to a further embodiment of the invention, however, it is also possible<br>
that the metallic layer is at the same time required for the visually optical effect. If a<br>
reflection hologram is used for example, the layer producing the optical effect usually<br>
consists of an embossed lacquer layer in which the diffraction structures of the holo-<br>
gram are embossed in the form of a relief structure, and a metal layer. The carrier layer<br>
of the transfer material is first provided with the embossed lacquer layer in which the<br>
diffraction structures are embossed. This lacquer layer is then provided with a metal<br>
layer. Before the metal layer is preferably vapor-deposited, however, a soluble ink is<br>
printed on for producing the coupling element, as explained above. After metalization,<br>
the soluble ink is removed and the integrated circuit applied, as likewise described<br>
above. Here, too, the abovementioned etching techniques can alternatively be used for<br>
structuring the metal layer.<br><br>
In this embodiment, the coupling element is to be recognized visually if the em-<br>
bossed lacquer layer, which forms the outermost layer facing the viewer in the finished<br>
security element, is transparent. If this effect is undesirable, the embossed lacquer<br>
layer can be colored. Preferably, metallic pigments are used for this purpose. Alterna-<br>
tively, the security element or security paper is laminated with a foil or provided with a<br>
print that hides the optical impression of the coupling element.<br>
This variant has the additional advantage that the layers of the security element<br>
ensuring the optical effect are undetachably connected with the machine-checkable<br>
integrated circuit. Manipulations of the layers producing the optical effect thus simul-<br>
taneously influence the machine-readable module.<br>
However, the coupling element need not necessarily consist of an accordingly<br>
formed metal layer. It can also be formed by a conductive polymer layer that is accord-<br>
ingly printed for example.<br>
The connection between coupling element and chip is effected in all embodi-<br>
ments either by electrically conductive connecting elements, such as conductive adhe-<br>
sives, tin-lead solder, etc., or contactlessly, e.g. capacitively.<br>
To make sure that manipulation by punching out a circuit together with the cou-<br>
pling element from a security element or a security paper provided therewith is no-<br>
ticed, the coupling element is preferably designed to cover a large area. The resulting<br>
punched holes would already be very striking visually even to a layman as of an area<br>
assumed by the coupling element of 20 square millimeters or more.<br>
The security paper provided with the inventive security elements can then be<br>
processed into any documents of value. If bank notes are produced from the security<br>
paper for example, the security paper is usually cut into sheets with a plurality of cop-<br>
ies that can then be processed in suitable printing machines. Each copy has at least one<br>
inventive security element. In a preferred embodiment, the security element is formed<br>
as a strip extending parallel to one of the edges of a copy. This has the advantage that<br>
the security element can be transferred to the security paper in a continuous process.<br><br>
During printing, the area of the security element can also be overprinted at least<br>
partially, thereby further increasing the forgery-proofness of the document of value, in<br>
particular if a tactile steel intaglio print is used for overprinting. However, the inven-<br>
tive security paper can also be used for producing other documents of value, such as<br>
passports, shares, visas, ID cards, certificates, admission tickets, accompanying docu-<br>
ments for transportation, security labels or checks, etc. The documents of value can in<br>
turn be fastened as antiforgery elements to any products, such as CDs, perfumes,<br>
pharmaceutical products, packages of all types.<br>
The forgery-proofness of the inventive document of value can be increased even<br>
further by storing certain data relevant to the document of value in the integrated cir-<br>
cuit in checkable fashion. For example, the history of use of the document of value can<br>
be stored in the integrated circuit. With bank notes for example, information about<br>
their issue and further life can be stored, thus permitting a hitherto hardly possible<br>
evaluation of the circulation behavior of the notes. It is equally possible to store infor-<br>
mation about fitness or unfitness for circulation of bank notes.<br>
Further, it is possible to mark or block documents of value for certain applica-<br>
tions. Such marking could open up especially advantageous possibilities in dealing<br>
with blackmailing money.<br>
In a special embodiment, the integrated circuit of the security element can be ad-<br>
ditionally equipped or connected with a photosensitive sensor that is likewise con-<br>
tained in the security paper or the security element and recognizes for example inci-<br>
dent light, heat, magnetism and other properties. The measured values of such sensors<br>
are transmitted to the integrated circuit and stored there. This makes it possible for ex-<br>
ample to record each copying operation of a document as incident light and to store the<br>
number of copying operations in the integrated circuit. This offers the advantage of<br>
making it possible to distinguish between legal and illegal copies. When a legal copy<br>
is made, the user is aware that there is a corresponding sensor in the security paper so<br>
that he can then erase the information about his legal duplication using a device avail-<br>
able only to him. Illegal duplication is not erased, however. If a check is done before<br>
each copying operation of whether the corresponding memory of the integrated circuit<br><br>
the integrated circuit has an entry, further copies can be prevented. This procedure is<br>
suitable in particular for documents that are usually stored sealed from light.<br>
Alternatively, identification numbers of the individual copying machines can also<br>
be stored in the integrated circuit. This opens up the possibility that all machines used<br>
for producing copies can be identified at a later time. This can be useful when tracing<br>
forgers. Finally, copying machines can also be equipped with corresponding readers<br>
that prevent a copying operation of the document of value when reading a correspond-<br>
ing marking from the integrated circuit.<br>
The integrated circuit can further be used for storing a type of electronic stamp of<br>
an issuing authority. This is of advantage in particular with visas or passports. For this<br>
purpose it is expedient to provide each document of value with individual information.<br>
This may be simple random numbers or more complex information which can include<br>
features peculiar to the document, such as special printing tolerances, transmission<br>
properties of the paper or the like. This information can further be encoded crypto-<br>
graphically.<br>
However, the integrated circuit can also be used for protecting the legible infor-<br>
mation applied to the document of value. For example, if identification information<br>
such as a number and an indication of the issuer is entered on a document of value, the<br>
corresponding information can also be stored in the integrated circuit. Storage of this<br>
information is preferably effected in encrypted form that can only be identified with<br>
the matching counter key. Upon a check of the document of value, the information<br>
contained in the integrated circuit is compared with the information actually present<br>
legibly on the document.<br>
If communication with the integrated circuit is effected contactlessly, the han-<br>
dling of such documents is relatively simple. They can then be used for example to<br>
perform a virtually complete check in connection with goods deliveries, border cross-<br>
ings and other operations by which flows of goods are handled together with docu-<br>
ments. The invention can be used for example to check smuggling operations.<br><br>
If a microprocessor is used as an integrated circuit, information encrypted by<br>
suitable cryptographic methods can moreover be produced in the integrated circuit of<br>
the security paper or document of value and transferred to a read/write device. Any<br>
other programs or multifunctional structures can also be used. Techniques known from<br>
data processing or from the field of smart-card technology can be used here.<br>
Further examples and advantages of the invention will be explained with refer-<br>
ence to the figures of the accompanying drawings. It is pointed out that the figures are only for illustration and do not<br>
show the invention true to scale.<br>
Fig. 1 shows an inventive document of value,<br>
Figs. 2 to 5 show different embodiments of the inventive transfer material in<br>
cross section,<br>
Figs. 6a) to 6e) show different examples of the inventive coupling element.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a variant of the inventive document of value in a top view. The ex-<br>
ample shown involves bank note 1 produced from the inventive security paper. The<br>
bank note bears inventive security element 2 executed as a transfer element and ap-<br>
plied using the transfer material explained in more detail hereinafter. Bank note 1 can<br>
have additional security elements, for example security thread 3. Security thread 3 is<br>
quasi woven into the paper as a so-called "window security thread" so that it passes to<br>
the surface of the bank note in certain areas 4.<br>
Figs. 2 to 5 show different embodiments of inventive transfer material 10. Trans-<br>
fer material 10 consists fundamentally of carrier layer 5 and transfer layer 6 that is<br>
transferred to the inventive document of value at least in certain areas. In the case of<br>
security element 2 shown in Fig. 1, transfer layer 6 is detached from carrier layer 5 in<br>
the form of a square for example. Carrier layer 5 can be provided with a separation<br>
layer to guarantee defined detachment of the transfer layer. This separation layer is not<br>
shown in the figures. Any other contour forms are of course also possible, including<br>
filigree structures such as guilloches, etc. Security elements 2 frequently also have the<br>
form of strips disposed parallel to security thread 3.<br><br>
Transfer layer 6 shown in Fig. 2 consists of layer 7 producing the optical effect,<br>
integrated circuit 8 and adhesive layer 9. Since integrated circuit 8 already has an inte-<br>
grated coupling element, no further layers for communication with the integrated cir-<br>
cuit are to be provided in the layer structure of transfer layer 6. Layer 7 producing the<br>
optical effect is therefore freely selectable. However, it is preferably opaque at least in<br>
the area of integrated circuit 8 so that integrated circuit 8 is not recognizable visually.<br>
Layer 7 producing the optical effect is shown all over here and can in turn be<br>
composed of a plurality of layers. This is the case for example if it is a thin-film ele-<br>
ment, which can be composed of a plurality of dielectric layers with different refrac-<br>
tive indexes and thin metal layers. Such a layer structure produces an angle-dependent<br>
interplay of colors.<br>
Layer 7 can also be any other layer producing an optical effect, for example a<br>
printed layer containing special pigments producing an optically variable effect. For<br>
this purpose liquid-crystal pigments or other pigments exploiting interference effects<br>
are preferably used, for example IRIODINE® from the Merck company.<br>
Adhesive layer 9 serves to fasten security element 2 to the document of value. It<br>
is preferably a hot-melt adhesive layer that is activated with the aid of suitably formed<br>
hot-stamping dies. However, adhesive layer 9 can also be provided only in certain ar-<br>
eas to already define the contour form of the transfer elements to be transferred on the<br>
transfer material. According to a further embodiment, it can also be completely absent.<br>
In this case the adhesive layer is applied in the desired form to the substrate that is to<br>
be provided with a transfer element.<br>
The transfer material shown in Fig. 3 is provided with an integrated circuit not<br>
having an integrated coupling element. Transfer layer 6 therefore contains not only all-<br>
over layer 7 producing an optical effect but also metal layer 11. Metal layer 11 is ap-<br>
plied in the form of a folded dipole, as shown in Fig. 6a), and forms the coupling ele-<br>
ment for integrated circuit 8. The connection between the terminals of folded dipole 11<br>
and the contact areas of the integrated circuit is effected via conductive adhesive layer<br>
12.<br><br>
Transfer layer 6 shown in Fig. 4 has a hologram consisting of embossed layer 13<br>
and metal layer 14. Metal layer 14 ensures that the relief-like diffraction structures of<br>
the hologram can be observed in reflected light. However, metal layer 14 has spaces<br>
19. Spaces 19 are formed so as to result in coupling element 11 for integrated circuit 8.<br>
As in Fig. 3, the coupling element is formed by a folded dipole insulated from the rest<br>
of metal layer 14 by spaces 19.<br>
In this example, metal layer 14 is simultaneously part of layer 7 producing the<br>
optical effect and of integrated circuit 8. However, coupling element 11 is to be clearly<br>
recognized in a top view if embossed layer 13 is of transparent design. If this effect is<br>
not desired, embossed layer 13 can be colored with translucent colors. It is also possi-<br>
ble to use nonconductive, metallic-looking pigments that blur the optical impression of<br>
coupling element 12.<br>
Transfer layer 6 shown in Fig. 5 likewise shows a hologram combined with an<br>
integrated circuit. In the present case, reflecting layer 14 of the diffraction structure<br>
does not serve simultaneously as a communication layer for integrated circuit 8.<br>
Rather, metal layer 14 is separated from metal layer 1 7 having coupling element 11 by<br>
insulating layer 15. Nevertheless, metal layer 14 has gaps 16 in the form of characters<br>
or patterns that are well readable at least in transmitted light. These gaps form a further<br>
visual authenticity feature.<br>
Metal layer 17 containing coupling element 11 is constructed analogously to re-<br>
flecting layer 14 shown in Fig. 4. That is, it has spaces 19 that insulate coupling ele-<br>
ment 11 from the rest of the metal layer.<br>
Gaps 16 and spaces 19 in metal layers 14 and 17 can be produced in different<br>
ways. For example, the metal layers can be vapor-deposited by means of correspond-<br>
ing masks in the desired form directly on particular layer 13, 15. Alternatively, the<br>
metal layers can also be produced in a first step as all-over metal layers, which are<br>
then covered with a protective layer in the desired areas. The non-covered free areas<br>
are then removed with the aid of suitable solvents. These removed areas correspond to<br>
gaps 16 or spaces 19.<br><br>
However, the method preferably used is to print layer 13, 15 in a first step with a<br>
preferably water-soluble ink in areas 16, 19. An all-over metalization is then applied<br>
by vapor deposition. In a last step, the soluble ink and the metal layer disposed there-<br>
above are removed with a corresponding solvent so that gaps 16 or spaces 19 arise. It<br>
is likewise possible to produce gaps 16 using a different method from that for produc-<br>
ing spaces 19.<br>
The same methods can of course also be used for producing coupling element 11<br>
as shown in Fig. 3.<br>
Fig. 6 shows different embodiments of the coupling element. What is shown in<br>
each case is solely the coupling element as used for example in Fig. 3. Any further<br>
metallic surroundings possibly present, as shown in Fig. 4 and 5, have been omitted<br>
for clarity's sake,.<br>
Fig. 6a) shows a folded dipole, which can additionally be provided with a metal-<br>
lic core to increase the power of the system, as shown in Fig. 6b). Alternatively, the<br>
coupling element can also be executed as a coil with a corresponding number of turns<br>
or with a metallic core, as shown in Figs. 6c) and 6d). A further capacitively operable<br>
variant is shown in Fig. 6e). The two metallic bars act as an open dipole here. These<br>
forms of coupling elements can of course be used in all examples shown and de-<br>
scribed.<br>
As explained above, these coupling elements are preferably produced by a corre-<br>
sponding metalization or demetalizing. However, they can alternatively be produced<br>
by printing technology with the aid of conductive polymers.<br>
The layer structures of transfer material 10 shown in Figs. 2 to 5 can be trans-<br>
ferred analogously to a security thread. In this case, carrier layer 5 is replaced with a<br>
plastic foil undetachably connected with the layer structure disposed thereon. The<br>
layer structure here corresponds to transfer layers 6 shown. This security thread can be<br>
woven into the security paper analogously to security thread 3 shown in Fig. 1. How-<br>
ever, the security thread can alternatively be disposed completely on the surface of the<br>
security paper or document of value. For this purpose the surface of the plastic carrier<br><br>
carrier opposite the layer structure is coated with a suitable adhesive. Analogously, it<br>
is possible to produce the security element as a self-supporting adhesive label with any<br>
contour form.<br><br>
