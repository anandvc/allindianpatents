FIELP OF INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a method for producing a nonwoven from continuous<br>
filaments. In addition, the invention relates to a device for carrying out such a<br>
method. In is within the scope of the invention that the continuous filaments<br>
consist of a thermoplastic material. As a result of their quasi-continuous length,<br>
continuous filaments differ from staple fibres which have substantially shorter<br>
lengths of, for example, 10 to 60 mm. The continuous filaments are normally<br>
produced using a spinning device or using a spinneret.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Basically, it is known from practice to produce voluminous nonwovens known as<br>
"high loft nonwovens" using staple fibres. In this case, the fibre baling is<br>
normally bonded by hot air bonding using a continuous flow method. These<br>
nonwovens are used, inter alia, in the hygiene industry (for example, as<br>
distributor layers 'in nappies) and in filter technology. Attempts have already<br>
been made to produce comparably thick or voluminous nonwovens from<br>
continuous filaments, where multicomponent filaments with natural crimping<br>
have been used. In this case, however, filament baling or a nonwoven with an<br>
irregular or inhomogeneous structure is obtained'. This is at least partly<br>
attributable to the fact that the activation of the crimping can result in shrinkage<br>
forces which result in ripping of the filament baling or the nonwoven. The result<br>
is unacceptable products.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
However, the technical object of the invention is to provide a method for<br>
producing a nonwoven from continuous filaments whereby thick or voluminous<br>
nonwovens with a very regular or homogeneous structure can be produced. In<br><br><br>
addition, it is the technical problem of the invention to provide a corresponding<br>
device.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE<br>
INVENTION<br>
In order to solve this technical object, the invention teaches a method for<br>
producing a nonwoven from continuous filaments, wherein filaments are<br>
produced of which at least some exhibit natural crimping,<br>
wherein the filaments are deposited in the depositing region of a conveying<br>
device to form the deposited filament and wherein the deposited filament is<br>
conveyed with the conveying device in the direction of a bonding device<br>
and wherein a gas stream flowing along in the conveying direction of the<br>
deposited filament on the surface of the deposited filament is generated.<br>
In principle, single-layer or multi-layer nonwovens consisting completely of<br>
filaments with natural crimping can be produced within the scope of the<br>
invention. However, it is also within the scope of the invention to produce a<br>
single-layer nonwoven comprising a mixture of filaments having natural crimping<br>
and non-crimping filaments. In multilayer nonwovens the individual layers can be<br>
formed from filaments with natural crimping or from non-crimping filaments or of<br>
mixtures of filaments with natural crimping with non-crimping filaments.<br>
Appropriately, a multi-layer nonwoven according to the invention comprises at<br>
least one layer consisting exclusively of filaments with natural crimping or a<br>
mixture of filaments with natural crimping with non-crimping filaments.<br>
The continuous filaments are initially spun from a spinning device or from a<br>
spinneret. These filaments are then appropriately cooled. It is within the scope of<br>
the invention that the filaments are stret'ched in a stretching device. The cooling<br>
and stretching can in particular take<br><br>
place in a combined cooling and stretching device. Before<br>
the filaments are deposited in the depositing region, they<br>
are preferably guided through a diffuser. The diffuser is<br>
then arranged between the stretching device or between the<br>
combined cooling and stretching device and the depositing<br>
region. The filaments emerging from the spinning device are<br>
preferably treated by the Reicofil III method (DE-PS 196 20<br>
379) or by the Reicofil IV method (EP-OS 1 340 843).<br>
Filaments with natural crimping means in particular<br>
filaments or bicomponent/multicomponent filaments in which<br>
crimping occurs after the drafting. In this case, the<br>
crimping therefore begins as soon as the stretching forces<br>
or the air stretching forces no longer act on the<br>
filaments. In this case, the crimping can initially take<br>
place before the depositing, i.e. between the drafting<br>
device and the depositing region, in particular in a<br>
preferably provided diffuser. This crimping which takes<br>
place before the filaments are deposited is described as<br>
"primary crimping". However, the filaments with natural<br>
crimping can in particular also develop (further) crimping<br>
after deposition. This crimping which takes place after<br>
deposition is described as "secondary crimping". Filaments<br>
with natural crimping preferably means within the scope of<br>
the invention filaments having radii of curvature of less<br>
than 5 mm after deposition on the conveying device in the<br>
stress-relieved state. These filaments then exhibit<br>
corresponding crimping having the aforesaid radii of<br>
curvature over most of their length. According to a very<br>
preferred embodiment of the invention, the filaments with<br>
natural crimping are bicomponent filaments or<br>
multicomponent filaments which preferably exhibit a side-<br>
by-sido arrangement. According to, another preferred<br>
embodiment, bicomponent filaments or multicomponent<br>
filaments having an acentric core/cladding arrangement can<br>
also be used as filaments with natural crimping.<br><br><br>
It is within the scope of the invention that the method<br>
according to the invention is carried out under the<br>
condition that crimping of the filaments (with natural<br>
crimping) takes place after stretching the filaments and<br>
before depositing the filaments. This therefore comprises<br>
the aforesaid primary crimping of the filaments. It is<br>
furthermore within the scope of the invention that crimping<br>
of the filaments (with natural crimping) takes place after<br>
depositing the filaments on the conveying device. This<br>
comprises the aforesaid secondary crimping.<br>
The conveying device appropriately consists of a conveyor<br>
belt or a plurality of successively connected conveyor<br>
belts. In this case, at least one conveyor belt is<br>
configured in the depositing region of the filaments as a<br>
gas-permeable (air-permeable) or gas-permeable (air-<br>
permeable) sieve belt. Such a sieve belt in particular<br>
comprises a continuous belt guided over deflecting rollers.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the<br>
filaments are deposited on the sieve belt as a conveying<br>
device or as a component of a conveying device to form the<br>
deposited filament and the deposited filament is exposed to<br>
suction air in a suction region of the sieve belt. It is<br>
also within the scope of the invention that the suction<br>
region comprises the depositing region for the filaments<br>
and appropriately also a region after this depositing<br>
region in the conveying direction. In order to achieve the<br>
action of suction air, preferably at least one suction<br>
device is located below the sieve belt. With such a suction<br>
device air is sucked through the sieve belt so that the<br>
filament or the deposited filament on the sieve belt is, as<br>
if were, sucked. This leads to a certain stabilisation of<br>
the deposited filament. As a result of the suction action,<br>
the deposited filament has a relatively small thickness<br>
(for example, a thickness of about 2 to 3 mm). In this<br>
suction region, the deposited filament is (still) fixed and<br>
held down on the sieve belt by a suction air field to<br><br><br>
survive the relative high air speeds in the depositing<br>
region without undesirable . displacements and<br>
inhomdgeneities. When leaving the. suction region, the<br>
deposited filament jumps up, as it wefe, particularly as a<br>
result of the . secondary crimping. The deposited filament<br>
then has a substantially greater thickness (for example, a<br>
thickness of 3 cm with 40 g/m2 weight per unit area) .<br>
According to the invention, a gas stream flowing along the<br>
surface of deposited filament is generated in the conveying<br>
direction of the deposited filament. The fact that the gas<br>
stream flows along the surface of the deposited filaments<br>
means in particular that the gas stream flows parallel or<br>
substantially parallel to the surface of the deposited<br>
filament or flows parallel or substantially parallel to the<br>
surface of the conveying device or the sieve belt. It is<br>
also within the scope of the invention that the gas stream<br>
flows past the surface of the deposited filament in the<br>
conveying direction behind the suction region. The gas<br>
stream is preferably an air stream.<br>
As has been stated above, on leaving the suction region the<br>
deposited filament as it were jumps up in particular as a<br>
result of the secondary crimping and a relatively thick<br>
deposited filament is then obtained. The invention is based<br>
on the finding that this deposited filament is endangered<br>
when jumping up or in the jumped-up state firstly because<br>
shrinkage forces from the second crimping can destroy the<br>
uniformity of the deposited filament and secondly because<br>
air forces act upon the jumped-up deposited filament and<br>
can as it were open this deposited filament. These air<br>
forces result from the fact that the deposited filament is<br>
moved at the speed of the conveying device or the sieve<br>
	...<br>
belt, as it were, against standing ambient air. The<br>
invention is now based on the finding that the deposited<br>
filament can be effectively stabilised against said<br>
negative effects by the gas stream flowing along the<br><br><br><br>
surface of the deposited filament in the conveying<br>
direction. In other words, the deposited filament according<br>
to the invention is stabilised in particular in the<br>
suction-free region by a forced air flow.<br>
It is within the scope of the invention that the flow rate<br>
of the gas stream (air flow) corresponds to at least half<br>
the conveying speed of the deposited filament, preferably<br>
at least 80%, more preferably at least 90% and very<br>
preferably at least 95% of the conveying speed of the<br>
deposited filament. According to a particularly preferred<br>
embodiment, the flow rate of the gas stream (air flow)<br>
corresponds to ' at least the cbnveying speed or<br>
approximately the conveying speed of the deposited<br>
filament. According to one embodiment of the invention, the<br>
flow rate of the gas stream (air flow) is somewhat higher<br>
than the conveying speed of the deposited filament and<br>
preferably a maximum of 20%, more preferably a maximum of<br>
15% and very preferably a maximum of 10% higher than the<br>
conveying speed of the deposited filament.<br>
According to a very recommended embodiment which acquires<br>
quite particular importance within the scope of the<br>
invention, the deposited filament is bonded with at least<br>
one fluid medium in the bonding device, preferably with at<br>
least one hot fluid medium. It is at. the same time within<br>
the scope of the invention that the deposited filament is<br>
exposed to the hot fluid medium in the bonding device with<br>
the proviso that the deposited filament is pressed against<br>
the conveying direction or against a gas-permeable sieve<br>
belt. At the same time, the surface of the deposited<br>
filament is appropriately exposed to the transverse action<br>
by forces of the hot fluid medium. The deposited filament<br>
is thereby pressed towards the conveying direction or onto<br>
the sieve belt. It is also within the scope of the<br>
invention that the hot fluid medium flows through the<br>
deposited filament and the gas-permeable sieve belt. This<br><br><br>
bonding preferably takes place in a bonding chamber through<br>
which the conveying device or the sieve belt with the<br>
deposited filament is guided. The bonding is appropriately<br>
carried out as hot air bonding. The fluid medium flows in<br>
the bonding device preferably perpendicular to the surface<br>
of the deposited filament and preferably from above onto<br>
the deposited filament. At the same time, it is within the<br>
scope of the invention that the area of the deposited<br>
filament is acted upon by the fluid medium, preferably by<br>
the hot fluid medium (-i.e. not only linearly).<br>
According to a very preferred embodiment of the invention,<br>
the gas stream flowing along the surface of the deposited<br>
filament is generated by means of the fluid medium flowing<br>
in the bonding device. In other words, the fluid medium<br>
(preferably the hot air flowing there) flowing in the<br>
bonding device is the driving force for producing the gas<br>
stream flowing along the surface of the deposited filament.<br>
At the same time, it is within the scope of the invention<br>
that the gas stream flowing according to the invention is<br>
at least substantially produced by a venturi effect.<br><br>
According to another preferred embodiment of the invention,<br>
gas is blown in and/or sucked in and is deflected by means<br>
of at least one flow guiding device to the gas stream<br>
flowing along the surface of the deposited filament. The at<br>
least one flow guiding device is preferably a flow baffle<br>
or a curved flow baffle.<br>
The subject matter of the invention is also a device for.<br>
producing a nonwoven of continuous filaments which exhibit<br>
at least some natural crimping, comprising at least one<br>
spinning device for producing filaments and comprising a<br>
conveying device with a depositing region in which the<br>
filaments can be deposited to form the deposited filament,<br>
wherein furthermore a bonding device is provided for<br>
bonding the filaments and wherein at least one generating<br><br><br>
device is provided whereby a gas stream flowing along the<br>
surface of the deposited filament in the conveying<br>
direction of the deposited filament can be generated<br>
between the depositing region and the bonding device. This<br>
gas stream according to the invention preferably flows in<br>
the conveying direction behind the suction region along the<br>
surface of the deposited filament and preferably as far as<br>
the bonding device.<br>
It is within the scope of the invention that a stretching<br>
device for stretching the filaments is arranged between the<br>
spinning device and the depositing region. It is<br>
furthermore within the scope of the invention to provide a<br>
cooling device between the spinning device and the<br>
stretching device. According to one variant, a combined<br>
cooling and stretching device is used. According to a<br>
particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, a<br>
diffuser for depositing the filaments is arranged between<br>
the stretching device and the depositing region. This<br>
diffuser is particularly important within the scope of the<br>
invention. The diffuser appropriately has diverging<br>
diffuser walls towards the depositing region.<br>
The invention is based on the finding that the method<br>
according to the invention and the device according to the<br>
invention can produce thick or voluminous nonwovens which<br>
nevertheless are distinguished by homogeneous properties<br>
and a homogeneous or uniform structure. As a result,<br>
nonwovens having optimal properties and optimal quality can<br>
be produced. It should also be stressed that these<br>
nonwovens of suitable thickness and homogeneity can be<br>
reproducibly produced. It should also be stressed that with<br>
a view to the considerable advantages achieved, the method<br>
according to. the invention can be carried out with<br>
relatively little complexity and in this respect only<br>
causes relatively low costs. Existing devices can easily be<br>
retrofitted with the components according to the invention.<br><br><br>
The invention is explained in detail hereinafter with reference to drawings<br>
showing only one exemplary embodiment. Shown in schematic view:<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Fig.1 is a section through a part of a device according to the invention,<br>
Fig.2 is a section through another part of a device according to the invention,<br>
Fig.3 is a particular embodiment of the subject matter according to Fig.2 and<br>
Fig.4 is another embodiment of the subject matter according to fig.2.<br>
The figures show a device for carrying out a method for producing a nonwoven<br>
of continuous filaments, where filaments 1 are produced, of which at least some<br>
exhibit natural crimping. According to one embodiment, the nonwoven may be a<br>
single-layer nonwoven which either consists exclusively of filaments with natural<br>
crimping or of a mixture of filaments with natural crimping and non-crimping<br>
filaments. The fraction of filaments with natural crimping is preferably at least 20<br>
wt. %, more preferably at least 30 wt. %. A multi-layer nonwoven where at least<br>
one layer (as described previously) comprises filaments with natural crimping can<br>
also be produced within the scope of the method according to the invention.<br>
It can be seen from Fig.l that the device according to the invention comprises a<br>
spinning device 2 for producing the filaments 1 and appropriately a cooling<br>
chamber 3 located below the spinning device 2 into which process air can be<br>
introduced for cooling the filaments 1. Also provided is a stretching device 4 for<br>
aerodynamic stretching of the filaments 1. Preferably located below the<br>
stretching device<br><br><br>
4 and in the exemplary embodiment is a diffuser 5 which is<br>
merely shown schematically. A laying unit consisting of two<br>
diffusers connected one after the other can also be<br>
provided, for example, below the stretching device 4. A<br>
conveying device configured as an air-permeable sieve belt<br>
6 is provided underneath the diffuser 5. In a depositing<br>
region 7 of this sieve belt 6 the filaments 1 are deposited<br>
to form a deposited filament 8. In the exemplary embodiment<br>
the deposited filament 8 is formed from filaments 1 with<br>
natural crimping, the filaments 1 preferably comprising<br>
bicomponent filaments with a side-by-side arrangement.<br>
After the stretching or below the stretching device 4 a<br>
first crimping (primary crimping) of these filaments 1<br>
takes place in the diffuser 5. The deposited filament 8 is<br>
conveyed to the left in the figures in the direction of a<br>
bonding device 9 using the sieve belt 6. In the enlarged<br>
section in Fig. 2 it is shown that the deposited filament 8<br>
is constructed as a shingle-like deposit. Newly laid<br>
filaments 1 are laid . on previously deposited filaments 1<br>
and in this way as it were, a slate-like deposit is formed.<br>
In a suction region 10 of the sieve belt 6, the deposited<br>
filament 8 is exposed to suction air. In other words, air<br>
is preferably sucked from below through the sieve belt 6 by<br>
means of a suction device not shown and the filaments 1 or<br>
deposited filament 8 are thereby sucked as it were onto the<br>
sieve belt 6. A certain stabilisation of the deposited<br>
filament 8 is hereby achieved. The suction region 10<br>
extends over the depositing region 7 for the filaments 1<br>
into a region 11 located in the conveying direction after<br>
the depositing region 7. The action i of the suction air<br>
fixes and holds down the deposited filament 8 in this<br>
suction region 10 on the sieve belt 6 so that the deposited<br>
filament 8 has a relatively small thickness (for example, a<br>
thickness of 2 to 3 mm). When the deposited filament 8<br>
leaves the suction region 10 during further conveyance with<br>
the sieve belt 6, the deposited filament 8 jumps up<br><br><br>
especially as a result of further crimping (secondary<br>
crimping) and results in a deposited filament 8 having a<br>
substantially greater thickness (for example, having a<br>
thickness of about 3 cm). This "jumping up" is indicated by<br>
a corresponding increase in the thickness of the deposited.<br>
filament 8 in Figs. 2 to 4. In particular, two<br>
disadvantageous effects can be associated with the jumping-<br>
up of the deposited filament 8. Firstly, shrinkage effects<br>
of the secondary crimping can destroy the uniform structure<br>
of the deposited filament 8. In addition, air forces can as<br>
i<br>
it were open the deposited filament 8 since the. deposited<br>
filament 8 is moved at the speed of the sieve belt towards<br>
the standing ambient air. This opening can occur in<br>
particular as a result of the shingle-like deposition shown<br>
in the enlarged section in Fig. 2.<br>
i<br>
According to the invention, a gas stream flowing along the<br>
surface of the deposited filament 8 in the conveying<br>
direction of the deposited filament 8 is now formed in the<br>
area where the deposited filament 8 jumps up or in the area<br>
of the secondary crimping, as is-indicated by an arrow G in<br>
the figures. This gas stream G flows in the conveying<br>
direction of the deposited filament 8 after the suction.<br>
region 10 along the surface of the deposited filament 8.<br>
The invention is based on the finding that this gas stream<br>
G according to the invention can stabilise the jumped-up<br>
deposited filament 8 and can reliably and effectively<br>
counteract the previously described negative effects ori the<br>
deposited filament; 8. The flow rate of this gas stream G is<br>
preferably at least equal to the conveying speed of the<br>
deposited filament 8 or the sieve belt speed, or the flow<br>
rate of the gas stream G is somewhat higher than the<br>
conveying speed of the deposited filament 8 or than the<br>
sieve belt speed.<br>
The deposited filament 8 is fed into a bonding chamber 1.2<br>
with the sieve belt 6, wherein bonding of the deposited<br><br><br><br>
filament 8 with a hot fluid medium, preferably hot air<br>
bonding, takes place.'The hot fluid medium or the hot air<br>
flows from above vertically to the surface of the deposited<br>
filament 8 flat onto the deposited filament 8. This is<br>
indicated schematically by the appropriate arrows in Figs.<br>
2 to 4.<br>
Figure 3 shows a particular embodiment' for producing a gas<br>
stream G according to the invention. An upper cover 13 is<br>
provided here and the gas stream G flows between this cover<br>
13 and the sieve belt 6 or the surface of the deposited<br>
filament 8 in the direction of the bonding device 9. The<br>
cover 13 is appropriately arranged parallel or<br>
substantially parallel, to the sieve belt 6 or to the<br>
surface of the deposited filament 8. According to a<br>
preferred embodiment and in the exemplary embodiment<br>
according to Fig. 3, the gas stream G flowing along the<br>
surface of the deposited filament 8 is produced by means of<br>
the fluid medium flowing into the bonding device 9. In<br>
i<br>
other words, the fluid medium flowing into the bonding<br>
chamber 12 forms the driving force for the gas stream G.<br>
Figure 4shows another preferred embodiment. Here air is<br>
blown from above into the area of the secondary crimping<br>
(area of the jumped-up deposited filament). The blown-in<br>
gas is deflected towards the gas stream G flowing along the<br>
surface of the deposited filament 8 by means of suitably<br>
curved.flow baffles.14. The gas can also be sucked in here.<br>
Appropriately and in the exemplary embodiment, the gas<br>
stream G flows perpendicularly or substantially<br>
perpendicularly to the direction of flow of the fluid<br>
medium in the bonding device 9 or in the bonding chamber<br>
1:2. According to a preferred embodiment and in the<br>
exemplary embodiment according to the figures, only one<br>
air-permeable sieve belt 6 is provided whereby the<br>
deposited filament 8 is conveyed from the depositing region<br><br><br>
7 via the region 11 and via the region of secondary<br>
