				<td>The present invention relates to a lubricating oil composition. Background art<br>
The viscosity of petroleum products generally varies greatly with temperature change, but the temperature dependence of the viscosity of, for example, a lubricating oil for automobile is desired to be small. On this account, an ethylene/α-olefin copolymer having a viscosity index improving effect has been widely used for the lubricating oil to make the temperature dependence smaller.<br>
The lubricating oil loses flow ability at low temperatures because a wax component in the lubricating<br><br>
oil is crystallized and solidified at low temperatures. In order to lower the solidifying temperature, a pour point depressant is contained in the lubricating oil, and the pour point depressant hinders formation of three-dimensional network that is due to crystallization of the wax component in the lubricating oil, and thereby lowers the pour point of the lubricating oil.<br>
Of the low-temperature properties of the lubricating oil containing an ethylene/α-olefin copolymer and a pour point depressant, the viscosity under the conditions of a high shear rate depends upon compatibility of a lubricating oil base with the ethylene/α-olefin copolymer, while the viscosity under the conditions of a low shear rate is greatly influenced by the pour point depressant. It is known that when an ethylene/α-olefin copolymer having a specific composition is used, the effect of the pour point depressant is markedly reduced by the interaction between the copolymer and the pour point depressant (see U.S. Patent No. 3,697,429 and U.S. Patent No. 3,551,336) .<br>
Therefore, the ethylene/α-olefin copolymer added to the lubricating oil that particularly needs excellent low-temperature properties is desired not only to have an excellent viscosity index improving effect but also not to hinder the function of the pour point depressant.<br><br>
In order to prevent the interaction between the pour point depressant and the ethylene/α-olefin copolymer, use of an ethylene/α-olefin copolymer obtained by a specific polymerizing apparatus and conditions and having an ununiform composition distribution as a viscosity index improver has been proposed (see Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 228600/1985) . However, any lubricating oil having excellent low-temperature properties independent of the shear rate has not been obtained so far.<br>
Under such circumstances as described above, the present inventor has made earnest studies and has found that by the use of a specific ethylene/α-olefin copolymer, decrease of the effect of the pour point depressant caused by the aforesaid interaction is not brought about, the compatibility with the lubricating oil base at low temperatures is adjusted, and thereby a lubricating oil having excellent low-temperature properties in every shear rate region can be obtained.  Based on the finding, the present invention has been accomplished.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a lubricating oil composition that is excellent in low-temperature properties, oxidative stability, lubricity at high temperatures and saving of fuel.<br><br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION The viscosity modifier for lubricating oil and the lubricating oil composition according to the invention are described in detail hereinafter.<br>
Viscosity modifier for lubricating oil The viscosity modifier for lubricating oil according to the invention comprises a copolymer of ethylene and an α-olefin (sometimes referred to simply as an "ethylene/α-<br><br>
olefin copolymer" simply hereinafter in this specification) having the following properties.<br>
The ethylene/α-olefin copolymer has an ethylene content (E) (content of recurring units derived from ethylene) of usually 40 to 77 % by weight.  The ethylene content (E) is desired to be in the range of 65 to 77 % by weight, preferably 68 to 74 % by weight, particularly preferably 68 to 72 % by weight, or in the range of 40 to 55 % by weight, preferably 43 to 53 % by weight, particularly preferably 45 to 51 % by weight.<br>
When the ethylene content is in the above range, a lubricating oil composition having satisfactory low-temperature properties can be obtained, and besides jellying of the lubricating oil composition at low temperatures due to crystallization of the ethylene sequence portions of the ethylene/α-olefin copolymer does not take place.<br>
The ethylene content (E) in the ethylene/α-olefin copolymer can be determined by l3C-NMR in accordance with the method described in "Macromolecule Analysis Handbook" (Society of Japan Analytical Chemistry, edited by Macromolecule Analytical Research Meeting, published by Kinokuniya Shoten).<br>
Examples of the α-olefins of 3 to 20 carbon atoms include propylene, 1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene, 3-<br><br>
methyl-l-butene, 3-methyl-l-pentene, 3-ethyl-l-pentene, 4-methyl-l-pentene, 4-methyl-l-hexene, 4,4-dimethyl-l-hexene, 4,4-dimethyl-l-pentene, 4-ethyl-l-hexene, 3-ethyl-1-hexene, 1-octene, 1-decene, 1-dodecene, 1-tetradecene, 1-hexadecene, 1-octadecene and 1-eicosene.<br>
Of the α-olefins, propylene is particularly preferable. That is, the ethylene/α-olefin copolymer is preferably an ethylene/propylene copolymer.<br>
The ethylene/α-olefin copolymer for use in the invention preferably substantially consists of only constituent units derived from ethylene and constituent units derived from an α-olefin. The ethylene/α-olef in copolymer of this constitution is excellent particularly in low-temperature properties.<br>
The ethylene/α-olefin copolymer has a molecular weight, as measured in terms of a weight-average molecular weight (Mw) of polystyrene by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), of 80,000 to 400,000.  When the weight-average molecular weight (Mw) is in the above range, the ethylene/α-olefin copolymer has excellent viscosity index improvability (thickening ability), and hence a small amount of the ethylene/α-olefin copolymer suffices to obtain a specific lubricating oil viscosity. Moreover, jellying hardly takes place at low temperatures, and the shear stability is good.<br>
When the weight-average molecular weight (Mw) of the ethylene/α-olefin copolymer is in the range of 260,000 to 380,000, preferably 270,000 to 350,000, the viscosity index of the lubricating oil can be particularly improved. When the weight-average molecular weight (Mw) thereof is in the range of 100,000 to 240,000, preferably 120,000 to 240,000, the shear stability of the lubricating oil viscosity can be particularly improved.<br>
The measurement by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) is carried out under the conditions of a temperature of 140°C and a solvent of orthodichlorobenzene.<br>
The ethylene/α-olefin copolymer desirably has Mw/Mn (Mw: weight-average molecular weight, Mn: number-average molecular weight), that is an indication of a molecular weight distribution of the copolymer, of not more than 2.4, preferably not more than 2.2.  If the molecular weight distribution is not more than 2.4, the shear stability of the lubricating oil viscosity is good.<br>
The ethylene/α-olefin copolymer has a melting point (Tm), as measured by a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), of not higher than 60°C.<br>
In particular, the melting point (Tm) of the ethylene/α-olefin copolymer having an ethylene content (E) of 65 to 77 % by weight is desired to be in the range<br><br>
of 15 to 60°C, preferably 25 to 50°C, more preferably 25 to 45°C.  The melting point (Tm) of the ethylene/α-olefin copolymer having an ethylene content (E) of 40 to 55 % by weight, as measured by a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), is desired to be not higher than -20°C, preferably not higher than -25°C, more preferably not higher than -30°C.<br>
The melting point is determined by obtaining an endothermic curve by means of a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), and the temperature at the maximum peak position of the endothermic curve is taken as the melting point. More specifically, a sample is placed in an aluminum pan, heated up to 200°C at a rate of 10°C/min, maintained at 200°C for 5 minutes, cooled to -150°C at a rate of 20°C/min and then heated at a rate of 10°C/min to obtain a 2nd run endothermic curve, from which the melting point is determined.<br>
The ethylene content (E, % by weight) and the melting point (Tm, °C) as measured by DSC preferably satisfy the following relation (relational expression)<br>
(I) .<br>
3.31xE-186 &gt; Tm	(I)<br>
The relational expression (I) is a measure of composition distribution, and if the relationship between the ethylene content and the melting point is out of the<br><br>
relational expression (I), the composition distribution of the ethylene/α-olefin copolymer is widened to thereby lower the low-temperature resistance of the lubricating oil, and besides a problem of opaqueness (haze) of the lubricating oil is brought about by the presence of a high ethylene content portion.  In the present invention, the ethylene/α-olefin copolymer is preferably one obtained by copolymerizing ethylene and an α-olefin using a catalyst comprising the later-described metallocene compound and ionizing ionic compound from the viewpoint of composition distribution.<br>
The relational expression (I) as the composition distribution parameter is: preferably<br>
3.31xE-192 &gt; Tm	(I1 ) ,<br>
particularly preferably<br>
3.31xE-193 &gt; Tm	(I").<br>
When a main chain and long-chain branches are present in the ethylene/α-olefin copolymer, the proportion (V, %) of αß carbon atoms to all carbon atoms in the main chain and the long-chain branches and the ethylene content (E, % by weight) preferably satisfy the following relation (II):<br>
V 
 <br>
The αß carbon referred to herein is carbon which is secondary carbon in the main chain (or long-chain branch) of the ethylene/α-olefin copolymer and, the nearest and the second nearest tertiary carbons from which are carbon at the α-position (adjacent carbon in the main chain) and carbon at the ß-position (carbon adjacent to the α-positioned carbon in the main chain), respectively.  The "proportion (V, %) of αß carbon atoms" referred to herein means a proportion of the αß carbon atoms to all carbon atoms forming the ethylene/α-olefin copolymer. When the proportion of the αß carbon atoms satisfies the above relation (II), flowability of the lubricating oil at low temperatures can be improved. Moreover, the lubricating properties at high temperatures can also be improved. The proportion of αß carbon atoms (V, %) can be determined by measuring 13C-NMR of the copolymer and in accordance with the method described in J.C. Randall "Macromolecules" (11, 33 (1978)).<br>
Especially when film strength of an engine oil is required, the ratio (I10/l2) of a melt index of the ethylene/α-olefin copolymer as measured at 190°C under a load of 10 kg to a melt index of the copolymer as measured at 190°C under a load of 2.16 kg is desired to be in the range of 8 to 16, preferably 8.0 to 16, more<br><br>
preferably 8.0 to 16.0, still more preferably 8.0 to 13, particularly preferably 8.0 to 13.0.<br>
Especially when shear stability of an engine oil is required, the ratio (I10/l2) of a melt index of the ethylene/α-olefin copolymer as measured at 190°C under a load of 10 kg to a melt index of the copolymer as measured at 190°C under a load of 2.16 kg is desired to be not less than 5 and less than 8, preferably not less than 5.0 and less than 8.0, more preferably not less than 5.5 and less than 7.5, still more preferably not less than 5.8 and less than 7.0.<br>
The ethylene/α-olefin copolymer exhibits a high viscosity index improving effect and hardly hinder the effect of a pour point depressant when blended with a lubricating oil base.<br>
When the ethylene/α-olefin copolymer is used as a viscosity modifier, a lubricating oil capable of satisfying low-temperature property standards of the GF-3 standards, which are standards of North America Lubricating Oil Standards of the next generation, can be obtained. Whether the lubricating oil satisfies the GF-3 standards or not can be judged by measuring the later-described CCS and MRV.<br>
The ethylene/α-olefin copolymer for use as the lubricating oil viscosity modifier of the invention can<br><br>
be obtained by copolymerizing ethylene, an α-olefin of 3 to 20 carbon atoms, and if necessary, other monomers in the presence of an olefin polymerization catalyst.<br>

When the amount of the ethylene/α-olefin copolymer (B) is in the above range, a lubricating oil composition having improved viscosity and excellent flowability at low temperatures can be obtained.<br>
Such a lubricating oil composition exhibits small temperature dependence and small rise of the pour point, said rise being attributed to the interaction between the ethylene/α-olefin copolymer and the pour point depressant, and has excellent low-temperature properties in every shear rate region.

EXAMPLE<br>
The present invention is further described with reference to the following examples, but it should be construed that the invention is in no way limited to those examples.<br>
In the examples, various properties were measured in the following manner. Ethylene content (E)<br>
The ethylene content was measured in a mixed solvent of orthodichlorobenzene and benzene-d6<br>
(orthodichlorobenzene/benzene-d6 = 3/1 - 4/1, by volume) using a nuclear magnetic resonance apparatus of Japan Electron Optics Laboratory LA500 Model under the conditions of a temperature of 120°C, a pulse width of 45° pulse and a pulse repetition time of 5.5 seconds. Viscosity at 100°C (K.V.)<br>
The viscosity was measured in accordance with ASTM D 445. In the examples, adjustment was made so as to obtain K.V. of about 10 mm2/sec. Cold Cranking Simulator (CCS)<br><br>
CCS was measured in accordance with ASTM D 2602. The CCS is used to evaluate sliding properties (starting properties) at low temperatures at the crank shaft. A smaller value of CCS indicates better low-temperature properties of a lubricating oil. Mini-Rotary Viscometer (MRV)<br>
MRV was measured in accordance with ASTM D 3829 and D 4684. The MRV is used to evaluate pumping performance of an oil pump at low temperatures. A smaller value of MRV indicates better low-temperature properties of a lubricating oil. Shear Stability Index (SSI)<br>
SSI was measured in accordance with ASTM D 3945. The SSI is a measure of kinematic viscosity loss that is caused by break of molecular chain of a copolymer component in a lubricating oil when the copolymer component suffers a shear force under the sliding motion. A larger value of SSI indicates larger loss of kinematic viscosity. High Temperature High Shear Viscosity (HTHS)<br>
HTHS was measured under the conditions of 150C/lo6s-1 in accordance with ASTM D 4624. The HTHS is used to evaluate lubricating oil performance at high temperatures at a high shear rate. A larger value of<br><br>
HTHS indicates better lubricating oil performance at high<br>
temperatures.<br>
Low-temperature storage stability<br>
After a lubricating oil was cooled at -18°C for 2 weeks, flowability (appearance) of the lubricating oil was observed and evaluated as follows.<br>
AA: The lubricating oil flows.<br>
BB: The lubricating oil does not flow (in gel state)<br>

Synthesis of olefin copolymer<br>
In a 2-liter autoclave (made of SUS) equipped with a stirring blade, said autoclave having been thoroughly purged with nitrogen, 900 ml of heptane was placed at 23°C.  To the autoclave, 5 Nl of propylene and 90 ml of hydrogen were fed while rotating the stirring blade and ice cooling. Then, the autoclave was heated up to 70°C and pressurized with ethylene so that the total pressure would become 6 KG. When the internal pressure of the autoclave became 6 KG, 1.0 ml of a hexane solution of triisobutylaluminum (TIBA) (1.0 mM/ml) was forced into the autoclave with nitrogen.  Subsequently, 3 ml of the previously prepared toluene solution containing 0.016 mM (in terms of B) of triphenylcarbenium(tetrakispentafluorophenyl)borate and<br><br>
0.0004 mM of (dimethyl (t-butylamido) (tetramethyl-η5-cyclopentadienyl)silane)titanium dichloride was forced into the autoclave with nitrogen to initiate polymerization. Thereafter, for a period of 5 minutes, temperature control of the autoclave was made so that the internal temperature would become 70°C, and ethylene was directly fed so that the pressure would become 6 KG. After 5 minutes from the initiation of polymerization, to the autoclave was fed 5 ml of methanol by means of a pump to terminate polymerization, and the pressure of the autoclave was released to atmospheric pressure.  Then, 3 liters of methanol was poured into the reaction solution with stirring. The resulting polymer with the solvent was dried at 130°C and 600 Torr for 13 hours to obtain 32 g of an ethylene/propylene copolymer.  Properties of the resulting polymer are set forth in Table 1.<br>

Then, the autoclave was heated up to 80°C and pressurized with ethylene so that the total pressure would become 8 KG. When the internal pressure of the autoclave became 8 KG, 1.0 ml of a hexane solution of triisobutylaluminum (TIBA) (1.0 mM/ml) was forced into the autoclave with nitrogen. Subsequently, 3 ml of the previously prepared toluene solution containing 0.1 mM (in terms of Al) of methylaluminoxane and 0.001 mM of bis(1,3-dimethylcyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride was forced into the autoclave with nitrogen to initiate polymerization.

When the internal pressure of the autoclave became 6 KG, 1.0 ml of a hexane solution of triisobutylaluminum (TIBA) (1.0 mM/ml) was forced into the autoclave with nitrogen.  Subsequently, 3 ml of the previously prepared toluene solution containing 0.02 mM (in terms of B) of<br>
triphenylcarbenium(tetrakispentafluorophenyl)borate and 0.0005 mM of (dimethyl (t-butylamido) (tetramethyl-η5-cyclopentadienyl)silane)titanium dichloride was forced into the autoclave with nitrogen to initiate polymerization. Thereafter, for a period of 5 minutes, temperature control of the autoclave was made so that the internal temperature would become 70°C, and ethylene was directly fed so that the pressure would become 6 KG. After 5 minutes from the initiation of polymerization, to the autoclave was fed 5 ml of methanol by means of a pump<br>
to terminate polymerization, and the pressure of the autoclave was released to atmospheric pressure. Then, 3 liters of methanol was poured into the reaction solution with stirring. The resulting polymer with the solvent was dried at 130°C and 600 Torr for 13 hours to obtain 31 g of an ethylene/propylene copolymer.  Properties of the resulting polymer are set forth in Table 4.<br>
Polymerization Example 7<br>
In a 2-liter autoclave (made of SUS) equipped with a stirring blade, said autoclave having been thoroughly purged with nitrogen, 900 ml of heptane was placed at 23°C. To the autoclave, 50 Nl of propylene was fed while rotating the stirring blade and ice cooling.  Then, the autoclave was heated up to 60°C and pressurized with ethylene so that the total pressure would become 8 KG. When the internal pressure of the autoclave became 8 KG, 1.0 ml of a hexane solution of triisobutylaluminum (TIBA) (1.0 mM/ml) was forced into the autoclave with nitrogen. Subsequently, 3 ml of the previously prepared toluene solution containing 0.2 mM (in terms of Al) of methylaluminoxane and 0.002 mM of bis (1,3-dimethylcyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride was forced into the autoclave with nitrogen to initiate polymerization. Thereafter, for a period of 60 minutes,<br>
temperature control of the autoclave was made so that the internal temperature would become 60°C, and ethylene was directly fed so that the pressure would become 8 KG. After 60 minutes from the initiation of polymerization, to the autoclave was fed 5 ml of methanol by means of a pump to terminate polymerization, and the pressure of the autoclave was released to atmospheric pressure. Then, 3 liters of methanol was poured into the reaction solution with stirring. The resulting polymer with the solvent was dried at 130°C and 600 Torr for 13 hours to obtain 34 g of an ethylene/propylene copolymer.  Properties of the resulting polymer are set forth in Table 4.<br>
Polymerization Example 8<br>
In a 2-liter continuous polymerization reactor equipped with a stirring blade, said reactor having been thoroughly purged with nitrogen, 1 liter of dehydrated and purified hexane was placed. To the reactor, a hexane solution of ethylaluminum sesquichloride (Al(C2H5)1.5'Cl1.5) adjusted to a concentration of 8.0<br>
mmol/1 was continuously fed for 1 hour at a rate of 500 ml/hr. Then, to the reactor were further continuously fed a hexane solution of VO(OC2H5)Cl2 (as a catalyst)<br>
adjusted to a concentration of 0.8 mmol/1 at a rate of 500 ml/hr and hexane at a rate of 500 ml/hr. On the<br><br>
other hand, the polymer solution was continuously drawn out from the top of the polymerization reactor so that the amount of the polymer solution in the reactor would be invariably 1 liter. To the reactor were then fed ethylene at a rate of 180 1/hr and propylene at a rate of 120 1/hr using a bubbling tube. The copolymerization reaction was carried out at 35°C by circulating a cooling medium through a jacket equipped outside the polymerization reactor.<br>
Through the reaction under the above conditions, a polymer solution containing an ethylene/propylene copolymer was obtained. The polymer solution was deashed by the use of hydrochloric acid and then introduced into a large amount of methanol to precipitate the ethylene/propylene copolymer, which was then vacuum dried at 130°C for 24 hours.  Properties of the resulting polymer are set forth in Table 4.<br><br>
