				<td>INDICATOR ATTACHMENT MECHANISM<br>
AND METHOD AND APPARTUS FOR REMOVING<br>
INDICATORS FROM HANGERS<br>
This application is divided out of Patent application No.l93/Cal/96<br>
of 2.2,1996<br>
Field of the Invention: a<br>
This invention relates to<br>
molded plastic<br>
having an indicator attachment an<br>
hangers/ sucn as garment hangers and to<br>
apparatus for removing indicators from garment<br>
hangers.<br>
Background of the Invention;<br>
For purposes of displaying garments<br>
suspended on hangers in an orderly and attractive<br>
manner to the retail customer, it is often desired to<br>
affix an indicating means on the hanger in a position<br>
visible to the retail customer while the hanger is<br>
suspended on a rack. The indicating means identifies<br>
some attribute of the garment suspended from the<br>
hanger, such as size, quality, color, manufacturing<br>
data, or pattern.<br>
The provision of a readily visible size<br>
indicator on a garment hanger is now accepted by<br>
retailers as a desirable addition to a garment hanger.<br>
To accommodate the various types of hangers available<br>
in the industry numerous indicating means have been<br>
developed in a variety of shapes, sizes and materials.<br>
Similarly, hangers have been developed to accommodate<br>
a variety of different indicating means.<br>
In Australian Patent No. 638436 and<br>
corresponding U.S. Patent No. 5,388,354, assigned to<br>
the assignee of the present invention, a low-profile<br>
molded plastic indicator for a garment hanger which<br>
requires limited modification to the hook of the<br>
hanger to enable the indicator to be securely attached<br>
to the top of the hook where it is most visible is<br>
described. The improvements described in the above<br>
patents overcame the major disadvantages of one type<br>
of indicator (trapezium-shaped) described in U.S.<br>
Patent No. 4,322,902 which required a specially molded<br>
hook profile to support the indicator.<br>
The indicator according to Australian Patent<br>
No. 638436 and U.S. Patent No. 5,388,354 is also<br>
designed to enable sorting into a predetermined<br>
orientation to enable automated handling and fitting<br>
of the indicators to hangers as described in U.S.<br>
Patent Nos. 5,272,806 and 5,285,566 which are assigned<br>
to the assignee of the present invention. For these<br>
reasons, the indicator has enjoyed considerable<br>
commercial success.<br>
The indicator is retained on the hook by<br>
means of at least one abutment projecting from the<br>
hook which engages an aperture in the side wall of the<br>
indicator. While it is possible to disengage the<br>
indicator from the abutment(s) by bowing the side<br>
walls in the regions of the apertures, this is a<br>
difficult operation and often results in some damage<br>
to the indicator or to the hanger.<br>
Furthermore, it is increasingly common for<br>
customers to require that the indicator be removable<br>
from the hanger for re-use with other sized garments<br>
or re-location and the attachment mechanism described<br>
above does not readily facilitate this operation. It<br>
is, of course, equally necessary for the indicator to<br>
remain securely attached to the hanger during the<br>
usual handling operations to which the hanger is<br>
subjected in day to day use.<br>
Summary of the Invention:<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present<br>
invention to provide an improved indicator attachment<br>
mechanism which securely fastens an indicator to a<br>
hanger but which permits removal of the indicator in a<br>
simple operation that reduces the likelihood of damage<br>
to the indicator or to the hanger.<br>
The invention therefore provides a molded<br>
plastic hanger having an indicator attachment device,<br>
wherein the hanger has a hook formed with an<br>
upstanding web to be received within a downwardly<br>
opening cavity of a molded plastic indicator, and<br>
attachment means formed on the web to engage and<br>
releasably secure the indicator to the web.<br>
In one preferred embodiment of the<br>
invention, the indicator has side walls formed with at<br>
least one aperture adapted to receive the attachment<br>
means. The attachment means preferably comprises a<br>
resilient detent means which is formed in said<br>
upstanding web and has a laterally projecting portion<br>
positioned to engage the side wall aperture of the<br>
indicator to prevent removal of the indicator from the<br>
hook. The resilient detent means also enables the<br>
laterally projecting portion to be disengaged from the<br>
opening to facilitate removal of the indicator from<br>
the hook without damage to the indicator or to the<br>
hook.<br>
In use, as will be described more fully<br>
below, the laterally projecting portion is disengaged<br>
from the side wall by inserting a probe or pin through<br>
the side wall aperture to displace the laterally<br>
projecting portion from the aperture to thereby<br>
release the indicator from the hook.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment, the<br>
detent means comprises a downwardly depending leg<br>
integrally molded within a molded opening in the<br>
upstanding web and resiliently connected to the web to<br>
enable deflection of the laterally projecting portion<br>
into the plane of the web to facilitate removal of the<br>
indicator from the web.<br>
The present invention also relates to a<br>
method and apparatus for removing indicators from<br>
garment hangers.<br>
The method and apparatus of the present<br>
invention provide an extremely versatile arrangement<br>
which can accommodate virtually all types of<br>
indicators mounted on the hook of a hanger. The<br>
method and system can also accommodate a wide variety<br>
of hanger types.<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the<br>
invention to provide a system which includes: a first<br>
means for receiving an indicator affixed to a hanger;<br>
a second means for securing said hanger for removal of<br>
the indicator; actuating means for driving the first<br>
and second means upwardly and downwardly; and means<br>
for ejecting the indicator. After the indicator is<br>
ejected the first plate is driven downwardly to its<br>
lower position and the apparatus automatically repeats<br>
the operation.<br>
In one embodiment the first means includes a<br>
first plate defining a recess, such that the indicator<br>
affixed to the hanger is received by the recess. The<br>
first means preferably further includes a pin<br>
positioned to displace the indicator attachment<br>
mechanism.<br>
In operation, the actuating means drives the<br>
first plate downwardly to receive the indicator in the<br>
recess and then upwardly to remove the indicator from<br>
the hanger while the hanger is secured by the second<br>
means.<br>
The hangers with indicators affixed thereto<br>
can be lined up on a feeding rail which is slanted<br>
such that the force of gravity drives the indicator<br>
affixed to the hanger into the recess. In a preferred<br>
embodiment the second means includes an edge for<br>
holding the top region of the hanger to prevent the<br>
hanger from moving when the indicator is removed by<br>
the upward movement of the first plate. In a<br>
particularly preferred embodiment the second means<br>
includes a plate which is driven downwardly to<br>
separate the hanger undergoing the decapping process<br>
from the rest of the hangers on the feeding rail.<br>
The first plate of the present embodiment<br>
includes a milled out portion defining a recess<br>
substantially corresponding to the shape and<br>
dimensions of the indicator such that when the first<br>
plate is in its lower position gravity forces the<br>
foremost indicator into the recess. The first plate<br>
also includes a pin extending from the recess in a<br>
position corresponding to the indicator attachment<br>
mechanism on the hanger. When the indicator engages<br>
the recess of the first plate the pin thereby<br>
displaces the indicator attachment mechanism to<br>
release the indicator from the hanger. It will be<br>
noted that the pin can be positioned in any of several<br>
positions provided the configuration of the recess<br>
conforms substantially to the exterior dimensions of<br>
the indicator. Thus, the system of the present<br>
invention is easily adapted to accommodate a variety<br>
of indicator configurations.<br>
To remove the indicator from the hanger the<br>
first plate is driven upwardly by, for instance,<br>
pneumatic cylinder means, when the indicator is<br>
resting in the recess of the first plate.<br>
The system further contemplates ejection of<br>
the indicator from the recess of the first plate. In<br>
one embodiment an aperture is defined in the first<br>
plate and the ejection means generates an air blast<br>
that passes through the aperture to eject the<br>
indicator from the recess. In a preferred embodiment<br>
the second means further includes a second plate<br>
having a window through which the indicator passes<br>
upon ejection. The window can be dimensioned to<br>
accommodate a variety of indicator configurations. A<br>
discharge tube can be attached to said second plate<br>
such that upon ejection the indicator is removed from<br>
the decapping apparatus and collected in a separate<br>
device.<br>
It is also an object of the present<br>
invention to provide a device for manually removing an<br>
indicator from a hanger with an indicator attachment<br>
mechanism. In a preferred embodiment the device<br>
includes a plate with at least one recess for<br>
receiving at least a portion of the indicator. The<br>
device further includes a pin positioned within the<br>
recess such that when the indicator rests in the<br>
recess the pin releases the indicator attachment<br>
mechanism. In a particularly preferred embodiment the<br>
indicator attachment mechanism comprises a resilient<br>
detent leg as discussed above which the pin depresses<br>
to release the indicator from the hanger.<br>
The device for manually removing the<br>
indicators from hangers can include through-holes for<br>
mounting to a support such that the operator need not<br>
handle the device while manually decapping the<br>
hangers. The device can further include more than a<br>
single recess and pin such that the device can be used<br>
in more than one orientation.<br>
It is a further object of the present<br>
invention to provide a method for removing an<br>
indicator from a hanger by inserting a pin defined on<br>
a first plate into the indicator to displace the<br>
indicator attachment mechanism and thereby release the<br>
indicator from the indicator attachment mechanism.<br>
The method can be performed either manually or<br>
automatically.<br>
The automated method for removing the<br>
indicator from the garment hanger comprises: holding a<br>
plurality of hangers with indicators affixed thereto;<br>
selectively engaging one of the indicators; displacing<br>
the indicator attachment mechanism and removing the<br>
indicator from the hanger.<br>
In one embodiment the method comprises<br>
selectively engaging and receiving the indicator<br>
affixed to a hanger in a recess of a first plate;<br>
inserting a pin included in the first plate into the<br>
indicator to displace the indicator attachment<br>
mechanism, and removing said indicator from the hanger<br>
by carrying the indicator upwardly in the first plate.<br>
In a second embodiment the method further contemplates<br>
moving the first plate upwardly and aligning said<br>
recess with indicator therein with a window in a<br>
second plate and ejecting the indicator from the<br>
recess through the window into a discharge tube.<br>
Before the indicator is selectively engaged<br>
the second plate can be driven upwardly to permit the<br>
indicator affixed to the garment hanger to advance<br>
along a feeding rail and rest in the recess in the<br>
first plate and then downwardly to prevent a second<br>
indicator affixed to a second hanger in the plurality<br>
of hangers with indicators from advancing. After the<br>
indicator is disengaged from the hanger the second<br>
plate is moved upwardly to permit the second indicator<br>
affixed to the second hanger to advance.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment of<br>
the present method the step of displacing the<br>
indicator attachment mechanism contemplates depressing<br>
a resilient detent leg included in the indicator<br>
attachment mechanism with a pin on the first plate to<br>
release the indicator from the hanger.<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments:<br>
Referring now in detail to the drawings, and<br>
to the embodiments depicted in Figures 1-10, there is<br>
illustrated generally a hook 2 adapted to engage a rod<br>
or other supporting means, with an upwardly projecting<br>
web 4 extending upwardly above the top contour 2a of<br>
hook 2 that engages the rod or other supporting<br>
device. An opening 6 is defined in said upwardly<br>
projecting web 4 such that upwardly projecting web 4<br>
completely surrounds opening 6. Leg 8 descends from<br>
an upper portion 10 of the upwardly projecting web<br>
into the opening 6.<br>
Referring to Figures 1 to 4 of the drawings,<br>
Figure 1 shows a first embodiment of the hook 2 of a<br>
molded plastic garment hanger in simplified form which<br>
in practice typically includes the usual strengthening<br>
ribs 12a, 12b shown in Figure 3 around the perimeter<br>
of the hook. The hook 2 is formed with a flange 14<br>
defining a top region 16, which in a preferred<br>
embodiment is flattened and slightly larger in<br>
peripheral dimensions than the lowermost portion of an<br>
indicator 18 (shown in Figures 3, 4 and 10) having .<br>
side walls 20, 22 formed with at least one retention<br>
aperture 24, 26, as described in Australian Patent No.<br>
638436 and U.S. Patent No. 5,388,354, the contents of<br>
which are incorporated into this specification by<br>
cross-reference. The apertures 24, 26 define through-<br>
openings which facilitate stacking of the indicator 18<br>
with other indicators prior to fitting to a hanger.<br>
The upstanding web 4 extends centrally from<br>
the top region 16 of the hook 2, and in this<br>
embodiment the web 4 is shaped similarly to the shape<br>
of the cavity of the indicator 18 so as to comfortably<br>
fit within that cavity. Alternatively, the web 4 can<br>
be configured in the manner shown in Figures 5 and 6<br>
herein or Australian Patent No. 638436. In a<br>
preferred embodiment the upstanding web is narrow.<br>
The web 4 is formed with integrally molded<br>
indicator attachment means 28. In the present<br>
embodiment the indicator attachment means includes<br>
central opening 6 from the upper portion of which a<br>
resilient detent leg 8 extends downwardly terminating<br>
in a laterally projecting portion 30 configured to<br>
engage one of the apertures 24 or 26 in the side wall<br>
of the indicator 18, as shown in Figure 4 of the<br>
drawings.<br>
Since the detent leg 8 is narrow and is<br>
resiliently connected to web 4, it is easily deflected<br>
laterally by means of a probe or pin inserted into the<br>
aperture 24 or 26 which engages laterally projecting<br>
portion 30 to displace laterally projecting portion 30<br>
toward the plane of the web to clear the aperture 24<br>
or 26 and allow the indicator to be removed from the<br>
web 4. This operation can be achieved simply and<br>
quickly with little or no damage to the indicator 18<br>
or the attachment means 28. Nevertheless, while the<br>
laterally projecting portion 30 remains in the<br>
position shown in Figure 4 of the drawings, the<br>
indicator 18 will remain securely fastened to the web<br>
4 and will withstand all usual handling operations to<br>
which the hanger is usually subjected in day-to-day<br>
use.<br>
To improve the flexibility of the detent leg<br>
8, it can be reduced in thickness as shown at 200<br>
inFigure 4 of the drawings.<br>
Referring now to Figures 5, 6 and 7 of the<br>
drawings, third, fourth and fifth embodiments of the<br>
invention are shown in which the same reference<br>
numerals are used to indicate similar parts. In the<br>
embodiment of Figures 5 and 7, the resilient detent<br>
leg extends angularly from its point of attachment to<br>
the web 4, as shown most clearly in Figures 8 and 9 of<br>
the drawings, and has a shorter laterally projecting<br>
portion 30 formed at its free end. The upstanding web<br>
4 of the hook 2 is further formed with a pair of ribs<br>
34 on either side of the central semi-circular opening<br>
6 to prevent the indicator (not shown in Figures 5 and<br>
7) from being inadvertently laterally displaced to<br>
clear the laterally projecting portion 30 which<br>
engages the aperture of an indicator similar to that<br>
shown in Figure 4 of the drawings. If desired, ribs<br>
34 can be provided in the embodiment of Figures 1-4 of<br>
the drawings.<br>
Figure 6 illustrates the hook 2 of the<br>
present invention in which flange 14 is integrally<br>
formed as part of strengthening rib 12, and extends<br>
around the perimeter of the hook 2.<br>
In the present invention the upstanding web<br>
4 formed on the hook 2 of the hanger can be shaped and<br>
dimensioned similar to the shape of the cavity of the<br>
indicator 18 so as to comfortably fit within that<br>
cavity. By the same token, as depicted in Figure 5,<br>
upstanding web 4 can also be formed in the "normal"<br>
shape of the shape of the hook 2 so the hanger can be<br>
used with or without the indicator. The web can also<br>
be configured in the manner shown in Australian Patent<br>
No. 638436 and U.S. Patent No. 5,388,354 or in any<br>
other manner to accommodate the cavity dimensions of<br>
any other type of indicator, including indicators that<br>
have angled or sloping end walls to conform to the<br>
angularity of the hook design.<br>
The indicator attachment mechanism described<br>
in the above embodiments provides a particularly<br>
simple and convenient means of retaining the indicator<br>
18 on the web 4 of the hook 2 while enabling the<br>
indicator 18 to be conveniently removed in a simple<br>
operation which does not significantly damage either<br>
the indicator 18 or the hook 2 of the hanger. In this<br>
way, the disadvantages associated with the attachment<br>
mechanism described in our Australian Patent No.<br>
638436 and U.S. Patent No. 5,388,354 are overcome in a<br>
simple but innovative manner.<br>
In the preferred embodiment, the improved<br>
hanger hook of the present invention is formed of<br>
styrene which provides a clear virtually transparent<br>
hanger for maximum display of garments suspended<br>
therefrom. Alternately, the hanger could be formed<br>
from K resin, H.I. styrene, polypropylene or other<br>
suitable thermoplastic.<br>
Referring now to Figures 11-21 of the<br>
drawings, a perspective view of an automated system<br>
for removing indicators from hangers is provided.<br>
Figure 11 shows a perspective view of one<br>
embodiment of the decapping apparatus according to the<br>
present invention. A garment hanger 1 to be decapped<br>
is provided with an upstanding web 4, which extends<br>
from a top region 16 of the hook of the hanger 1. The<br>
web is formed with integrally molded indicator<br>
attachment means. The attachment means includes a<br>
central opening defined in the upper portion of the<br>
web 4 with a detent leg, which extends downwardly<br>
terminating in a laterally projecting portion 30<br>
configured to engage one of the apertures 24, 26 in<br>
the side walls of the indicator 18. In a preferred<br>
embodiment the laterally projecting portion 30 is<br>
narrow and resiliently connected to the web 4. In the<br>
embodiment depicted in Figure 11 the top region 16 is<br>
flat and has a width larger than the indicator 18. As<br>
shown more clearly in Figure 12, side wall of the<br>
indicator 18 is not aligned with the side walls of the<br>
hook of the flange. A top view of the indicator and<br>
hook of this embodiment is provided in Figure 10 which<br>
more clearly shows top region 16 of hook 2 extending<br>
beyond side walls 22 and 24 of the indicator 18. In a<br>
second preferred embodiment illustrated in Figure 16,<br>
the top region of the hook and the indicator have<br>
about the same width.<br>
The method and apparatus for removing the<br>
indicator 18 from the hangers 2 will be hereinafter<br>
described with respect to Figures 11-21. Throughout<br>
this description, the term decapping will be used to<br>
describe the removal of the indicator 18 from hanger<br>
1.<br>
As illustrated in Figure 11, the laterally<br>
extending portion 30 is easily deflected laterally by<br>
means of a pin 120 inserted in the aperture 24 of the<br>
indicator 18 which engages the laterally extending<br>
portion 30 to displace it towards the plane of the web<br>
4 to clear the aperture 24 and allow the indicator 18<br>
to be removed from the hanger 1. With the decapping<br>
apparatus of the present invention, indicators 18 can<br>
be automatically removed from their respective hangers<br>
1.<br>
In this embodiment the hanger 1 is fed to<br>
the decapping apparatus by means of a feeding rail<br>
105. The feeding rail 105 is inclined so that the<br>
hangers 1 move downwardly toward the decapping<br>
apparatus by gravity. The hangers 1 can be put onto<br>
the feeding rail 105 manually or automatically. Other<br>
means to feed hangers 1 to the decapping apparatus<br>
could comprise a screw conveyor, a belt conveyor, or<br>
any other appropriate means to carry the hangers<br>
toward the decapping apparatus.<br>
The decapping apparatus includes a front<br>
plate 106, a back plate 107 and an actuating means<br>
108. The actuating means 108 comprises an escapement<br>
valve, which is pneumatically driven and includes two<br>
rods. Each of the rods is connected to the plate 106<br>
or 107 via respective connecting means 109 and 110.<br>
Front plate 106 and back plate 107 are arranged<br>
vertically and are facing each other. In the<br>
embodiment shown in Figure 11, the two plates 106 and<br>
107 are almost quadratic, but any other appropriate<br>
shape, for example rectangular, can be used. The<br>
actuating means 108 moves the front plate 106 and the<br>
back plate 107 parallel to each other in a vertical<br>
plane. This movement is periodically repeated, so<br>
that one hanger after another can be decapped.<br>
As can be seen in Figure 11, the feeding<br>
rail 105 extends under the two plates 106 and 107.<br>
The distance between the plates 106 and 107 when said<br>
plates are in their lower positions and the feeding<br>
rail 105 is preferably such that pin 120 in its lower<br>
position will be aligned with aperture 24 of indicator<br>
18. The height of the assembly is adjusted to provide<br>
automatic operation for different styles of hanger<br>
hooks. As illustrated in Figure 11, the back plate<br>
107 is in its lower position, and the front plate 106<br>
is in its upper position. When the hanger 1 moves<br>
down the feeding rail 105 toward the decapping<br>
apparatus, the movement of the hanger 1 is stopped by<br>
the back plate 107. As shown in Figure 12, in<br>
operation, a plurality of hangers 1 are waiting in<br>
front of the decapping apparatus on the feeding rail<br>
105 in line, to be decapped one after the other.<br>
As shown in Figure 11, at the start of the<br>
decapping cycle, the back plate 107 is lowered to its<br>
lowermost position. Plate 107 has a recess 119<br>
positioned on an outer portion of the surface facing<br>
the front plate 106. Recess 119 is dimensioned to<br>
correspond to the dimensions of the indicator 18, so<br>
that when a hanger 1 is pressed against the back plate<br>
107, the indicator 18 is received in the recess 119.<br>
A pin 120 is provided on the back wall of the recess<br>
119 in a position corresponding to the aperture 24 of<br>
the indicator 18. The dimensions, such as the size<br>
and the shape of the pin 120 are selected according to<br>
the dimensions, particularly the shape and the depth,<br>
of the aperture 18, so that the pin 120 enters the<br>
aperture 18 and is able to displace the laterally<br>
projecting portion 30 of the web 4 of the hanger 1 to<br>
clear the aperture 18, and allow the indicator 18 to<br>
be removed from the hanger 1 as described above. In<br>
the preferred embodiment shown in Figure 11, the pin<br>
20 has a rectangular cross-section, but any other<br>
appropriate shape can be used, as will be described<br>
herein.<br>
At the start of the decapping cycle, the<br>
front plate 106 is raised but only needs to be raised<br>
upwardly until it no longer covers the recess 119. In<br>
other words, the amplitude of the movement of the<br>
plates 106 and 107 has to be at least the height of<br>
the recess 119, so that the indicator 18 can be<br>
received in the recess 119.<br>
After the indicator 18 is received in the<br>
recess 119 of the back plate 107, the front plate 106<br>
is moved downwardly to seat the indicator 18 firmly or<br>
at least to hold the indicator firmly in the recess 19<br>
of the back plate 107. In this position the pin 120<br>
of the back plate 107 displaces the laterally<br>
extending portion 30 of the hanger 1, to permit the<br>
release of the indicator 18 from the hanger 1. The<br>
pin 120 is long enough to fully displace the laterally<br>
extending position 30 from the recess 24 of indicator<br>
18, but is not long enough to engage the aperture 6 of<br>
hook 2. As is shown in Figure 12, the lower edge 14 6<br>
of the front plate 106 can be beveled, so that the<br>
downward movement of the front plate 106 separates<br>
hanger 1 from the rest of the hangers so that front<br>
plate 106 enters between the hangers. In the<br>
embodiment shown in Figure 12, the lower edge is<br>
beveled towards the back plate 107.<br>
As illustrated in Figure 15 when the pin 120<br>
has displaced the laterally extending portion 30 from<br>
the indicator 18, the indicator may be removed from<br>
hanger 1 when the back plate 107 is moved upwardly to<br>
its upper position, while the front plate 106 stays in<br>
its lower position. Since pin 120 of the back plate<br>
107 extends into the aperture 18 of the indicator 18,<br>
the back plate 107 carries the indicator 18 upwardly.<br>
In the embodiment shown in Figures 11-15, front plate<br>
106 engages hanger 1 and prevents the hanger 1 from<br>
also being carried upwardly. Figure 13 illustrates<br>
this situation, wherein both of the plates 106 and 107<br>
are in their lower positions and the beveled lower<br>
edge 146 of the front plate 106 holds the hanger 1<br>
down by abutting against the edge of the top region<br>
116 of the hook of the hanger 1. Consequently, the<br>
pin 120 has two functions: displacing the laterally<br>
extending portion 30 of the hanger 1 to release the<br>
indicator 18 from the hanger 1 and carrying the<br>
indicator 18 upwardly to separate the indicator 18<br>
from the hanger 1.<br>
Figure 14 shows the decapper mechanism with<br>
a second embodiment of the front plate 106. The lower<br>
edge 148 has a step-shape to hold the edge of the top<br>
region 16 down. As depicted in this embodiment and<br>
Figure 2 top region 16 is preferably flat. For<br>
clarity of illustration, Figures 13 and 14 show only<br>
the plates 106 and 107 in their lower positions, a few<br>
hangers 1 and the feeding rail 105. As illustrated in<br>
Figure 11, the front plate 106 has an aperture or a<br>
window 118 having generally the same shape as the<br>
recess 119 of the back plate 107. When the back plate<br>
107 is in its upper position and the front plate 106<br>
is in its lower position, the recess 119 and the<br>
window 118 match, so that the indicator 18 can be<br>
removed from the recess 119 through the window 118.<br>
The window 118 can have any appropriate shape, as long<br>
as the indicator 18 can pass through it.<br>
In the described embodiment, the indicator<br>
18 is removed from the recess 119 by means of an air<br>
blast. As can be seen in Figure 11, the back wall of<br>
the recess 119 has an aperture 121, which is connected<br>
to an air control means by means of a tube 127, shown<br>
in Figure 15. The air blast through the opening 121<br>
is controlled, so that, when the back plate 107<br>
reaches its upper position, and the front plate 106 is<br>
in its lower position, an air blast is generated or<br>
enabled, which pushes the indicator 18 through the<br>
window 118 of the front plate 106. The released<br>
indicator 18 passes through the window 118 of the<br>
front plate 106 and is collected by a discharge tube<br>
124, which is positioned in front of the window 118<br>
and leads the released indicator to a container 125.<br>
Upon removal of the indicator 18, hanger 1<br>
continues, as soon as the back plate 107 is moved<br>
upwardly, to slide down the feeding rail 105. As<br>
illustrated in Figure 15, hanger 1 with web 4 is<br>
moving down the feeding rail 105 after being decapped.<br>
The decapped hanger is either collected manually or<br>
automatically therefrom, for example by means of a<br>
screw conveyor. Said screw conveyor can collect<br>
decapped hangers from a plurality of feeding rails 105<br>
coming from respective decapping apparatuses.<br>
As illustrated in Figures 11 and 12, the<br>
decapping apparatus is driven pneumatically, and<br>
further comprises position control means 111, air<br>
control means 114, a first timer 116, a second timer<br>
117, and an air valve 137. The air valve 37 generates<br>
and/or controls the pressurized air, by which the<br>
decapping apparatus according to the preferred<br>
embodiment of the present invention is controlled and<br>
driven.<br>
The air valve 137, the timers 116 and 117,<br>
the actuating means 108, the air control means 40 and<br>
the position control means 111 respectively are<br>
connected by air tubes for pneumatic control. Also,<br>
the entire apparatus is held and fixed to a holding<br>
means (not shown).<br>
As shown in Figure 12, the position control<br>
means 111 comprises a first detector 112 for the<br>
position of the front plate 106 and a second detector<br>
113 for the position of the back plate 107. The first<br>
detector 112 and the second detector 113 work on a<br>
pneumatical basis and have a similar structure. First<br>
and second detectors 112 and 113 each include<br>
generally a cylindrical tube illustrated by 144 and<br>
145, respectively, and pistons 122 and 123,<br>
respectively, which are movable within each of said<br>
cylindrical tubes 144 and 146. The outer ends of<br>
pistons 122 and 123 are provided with contact plates,<br>
which are contacted by the upper sides of the front<br>
plate 106 and the back plate 107, respectively.<br>
In the upper position, the front plate 106<br>
and the back plate 107 press inwardly pistons 122 and<br>
123, respectively, and cause a pneumatic signal in the<br>
position control means 111, thereby permitting a<br>
steady control of the position and the movement of the<br>
plates 106 and 107. Figure 12 shows a cross section<br>
of the control means 111 and the plates 106 and 107,<br>
whereby the position of the plates 106 and 107 is the<br>
same as in Figure 11. Also, the discharge tube 124<br>
and a collecting container 125 for the released<br>
indicators 18 are illustrated.<br>
Figure 15 illustrates a side view of the air<br>
control means 114 and the tube plates 106 and 107.<br>
The air control means 114 comprises a third detector<br>
115 for detecting the position of the back plate 107.<br>
Third detector 115 has a cylindrical tube 149 and a<br>
piston 126, which, generally have the same shape and<br>
function as the first and second position detectors<br>
112 and 113 as described above. In Figure 15, the<br>
back plate 107 is in its upper position, and the front<br>
plate 106 is in its lower position. The back plate<br>
having released and carried a indicator 18 upwardly<br>
from hanger 1, contacts a contact plate 26 of the<br>
position detector 115 and moves the contact plate 126<br>
together with its piston into the cylindrical tube of<br>
the detector 115. This causes a pneumatic signal<br>
within the air control means 114, which enables a<br>
pressurized air blast through a tube 127, which is<br>
connected to the opening 121 of the back plate 107 by<br>
appropriate connection 128. The air blast through the<br>
opening 121 ejects the released indicator 18 through<br>
the window 118 of the front plate 106 into the<br>
discharge tube 124. The arrow in Figure 13 indicates<br>
the direction of the movement of the indicator 18.<br>
In operation, the back plate 107 moves<br>
downwardly to its lower position, which is followed by<br>
an upward movement of the front plate 106 to its upper<br>
position. The whole movement cycle is repeated<br>
periodically, so that a plurality of hangers 1 can be<br>
decapped easily and reliably in an automated process.<br>
Since one of the plates 106 and 107 is always in its<br>
respective lower position, there will be always a<br>
number of hangers 1 on the feeding rail 105 waiting to<br>
be decapped one after another, as shown in Figures 12<br>
to 15.<br>
The actuating means 108 controls the<br>
movement of the two plates 106 and 107, so that the<br>
front plate 106 cannot move upwardly when the back<br>
plate 107 is not in its lower position, and the back<br>
plate 107 cannot move upwardly when the front plate<br>
106 is not in its lower position. This ensures that<br>
the hangers to be decapped do not slide along the<br>
feeding rail 105 under the plates 106 and 107 without<br>
being decapped.<br>
The first timer 116 controls the regular<br>
cycle of the movement of the two plates 106 and 107,<br>
whereas the second timer 117 enables a repeated<br>
downward movement of the front plate 106. If, for<br>
example the hook of the hanger 1 is bent or damaged,<br>
or the indicator 18 is bent or damaged, the front<br>
plate 106 is not permitted to slide downwardly to<br>
press or hold the indicator 18 into the recess 119,<br>
since its lower edge contacts the upper edge of the<br>
indicator 18 and is therefore restricted in its<br>
downward movement. In this case, the timer 117 gives<br>
a signal to the actuating means 108 to lift the front<br>
plate 106 up again and retry to move it downwardly.<br>
This is repeated, until the indicator 18 is properly<br>
received in the recess 119 of the back plate 107 and<br>
the front plate 106 can move to its lower position<br>
without resistance. This problem can already<br>
partially be avoided by an appropriate angle or bend<br>
of the lower edge of the front plate 106, as discussed<br>
above.<br>
Figure 16 shows a cross-section of the two<br>
plates 106 and 107 in their lower positions and<br>
several hangers 1 to be decapped on feeding rail 105.<br>
These hangers 1 have a top region 16a on their hooks,<br>
which does not extend beyond the width of the<br>
indicators 18. In other words, the sidewalls of the<br>
indicators 18 are substantially even with the<br>
sidewalls of the hooks and the hangers. Therefore,<br>
the hangers 1 cannot be held down by the lower edge of<br>
the front plate 106 abutting the edge of the top<br>
region 16a, as described and shown with respect to<br>
Figures 13 and 14. Since the hangers 1 cannot be held<br>
down by the front plate 106, when the back plate 107<br>
moves upwardly, this embodiment of the invention<br>
further includes a holding means 152 which is<br>
activated to hold down the hanger 1 being decapped,<br>
while the back plate 107 is moving up. The holding<br>
means 152 is pivotable around an axis 155. In the<br>
present embodiment the holding means includes two<br>
parallel L-shaped arms 153, which are connected by a<br>
cross bar 154, as depicted in Figures 16 and 17.<br>
In the holding position, the two arms 153 of<br>
the holding means 152 extend parallel to both sides of<br>
the feeding rail 105 and the hook of the hanger 1, so<br>
that the arms 152 extend perpendicularly to the hanger<br>
1. The hanger 1 cannot move upwardly, since its upper<br>
edge abuts the lower surface of the arms 152. After<br>
the indicator 18 is removed from the hanger 1, the<br>
holding means is pivoted back to a free position<br>
(dashed lines in Figure 16), so that the decapped<br>
hanger 1 can move down the rail 105. In a different<br>
embodiment (not shown) the holding means could include<br>
a similarly shaped holding means being swung<br>
horizontally to hold the hanger 1 down.<br>
In Figures 11 to 16, the structure of the<br>
front plate 106 and the back plate 107 is only<br>
schematically shown. Figures 18 and 19 show detailed<br>
perspective views of the back plate 107 and the front<br>
plate 106, respectively.<br>
Figure 18 shows the back plate 107 in a<br>
perspective front view. The recess 119 is formed in<br>
the lower portion of a wall member 132 extending from<br>
the middle portion of the back plate 107. The recess<br>
119 can be dimensioned to accommodate the indicator 18<br>
which, as depicted, has a basically rectangular shape.<br>
The recess 119 is provided with the pin 120 and the<br>
aperture 121. The dimensions of the recess 119 are<br>
slightly larger than the dimensions of the indicator<br>
18 to be decapped, so that the indicator 18 can be<br>
oriented properly upon entering into the recess 119.<br>
This is important to ensure that the aperture 24 of<br>
the indicator 18 receives the pin 120.<br>
The recess 119 can be replaced by any other<br>
appropriate means, for example a frame or a single<br>
sidewall, as long as the pin 120 can enter into the<br>
opening 24 to release the indicator attachment<br>
mechanism to remove the indicator 18, when the<br>
indicator 18 is pressed or held against the back<br>
plate. The shape of the pin 120 in Figure 18 is<br>
basically rectangular, but can be any other<br>
appropriate shape as necessary to match opening 24.<br>
As shown in Figure 18, plate 107 has two<br>
rail or slide members 130 and 131 bolted thereto,<br>
which are positioned to each side of the wall member<br>
132 defining a space between the wall member and the<br>
rail members 130 and 131 respectively. The rail<br>
members 130 and 131 each have a generally rectangular<br>
shape with concave surfaces and extend the complete<br>
height of the back plate 107. The lower sides of the<br>
rail members 130 and 131 and the wall member 132 are<br>
connected by a common base plate 129, which extends<br>
from and over the entire length of the back plate 107.<br>
Rail or slide members 130 and 131 guide the movement<br>
of the plates 106 and 107 in connection with bearing<br>
assemblies 133, 134, 135 and 136, which are shown in<br>
Figure 15.<br>
Figure 19 shows a perspective back view of<br>
the front plate 106. The bearing assemblies 133, 134,<br>
135 and 136 each have a generally longitudinal shape<br>
and extend vertically from and over a portion of the<br>
height of the front plate 106. One pair of bearing<br>
members 133 and 134 is located to the left of the<br>
window 18, and another pair of bearing assemblies 135<br>
and 136 is located to the right of the window 118.<br>
Each pair of bearing assemblies defines a space<br>
therebetween wherein the rail or slide members 30 and<br>
31 of the back plate 107 can be inserted, when the<br>
decapping apparatus of the present invention is<br>
assembled. In other words, the rail or slide member<br>
130 is received in the space between the bearing<br>
assemblies 135 and 136, and the rail or slide member<br>
131 is received in the space between the bearing<br>
assemblies 133 and 134. This enables an exact<br>
reciprocable movement of the plates 106 and 107. In a<br>
particularly preferred embodiment slide members 133,<br>
134, 135 and 136 are a pair of roller-bearing<br>
assemblies having parallel rollers which engage rail<br>
members 130 and 131 and support the plates from either<br>
side.<br>
Figure 20 shows an enlarged perspective view<br>
of the pin 120 of the recess 119. In the preferred<br>
embodiment pin 120 has a generally rectangular shape<br>
and is sufficiently small to be able to enter into the<br>
opening 24 of the indicator 18 to be decapped. Also,<br>
the pin 120 has a height sufficient to displace the<br>
laterally extending portion 30 of the web of the<br>
hanger 1 thereby enabling the indicator 18 to be<br>
released from the hanger 1.<br>
Figure 21 shows an enlarged perspective view<br>
of a second preferred embodiment of the pin 120 of the<br>
139 with the indicator 18 from the hanger 1. In a<br>
preferred embodiment the plate 138 can define through-<br>
holes 176 for mounting the device to a support (not<br>
shown).<br>
All the variations and features explained in<br>
view of the recess 119 and the pin 120 of the back<br>
plate 107 of the decapping apparatus are also true for<br>
the recess 139 and the pin 140 of the plate 138 of the<br>
manual decapper. The pin 140 can also be configured<br>
as shown in Figures 20 and 21. In the preferred<br>
embodiment shown in Figures 22 and 23, the plate 138<br>
has a rectangular shape for ease of handling by the<br>
operator with the recess 139 being provided at a long<br>
side of the plate 138. However, in the alternative,<br>
the recess can be provided at a short side of the<br>
plate 138. Or the decapper device 138 can have<br>
further recesses, so that depending on the size and<br>
the shape of the indicator 18 to be removed multiple<br>
applications with the manual decapper of the present<br>
invention can be performed. For ease of operation the<br>
operator may chose to mount the device 138 to a<br>
support (not shown) via through-holes 176 so that it<br>
is not necessary for the operator to handle the manual<br>
device 138 but only the hangers and the removed<br>
indicators.<br>
In the embodiment shown in the Figures 22<br>
and 23, a further recess 141 is provided on one of the<br>
short sides of the rectangular plate 138. The recess<br>
141 is provided with a pin 142 positioned on the edge<br>
of the short side 143 and has no side walls. This<br>
allows the recess 141 and the pin 142 to be applied to<br>
indicator caps 18 of any configuration. In addition,<br>
the short side 143 can be curved thereby adapting to<br>
the form of the hook of the hanger 1, from which the<br>
indicator 18 is to be removed. It should be<br>
understood, that for the recess 141 and the pin 142<br>
the above-described features and variations explained<br>
in view of the recesses 119 and 139, and the pins 120<br>
and 140 are also true and applicable.<br>
Also, it should be understood that although<br>
preferred embodiments of the present invention have<br>
been described, various modifications by one skilled<br>
in the art can be made without departing from the<br>
scope of the invention as defined in the enclosed<br>
claims. Particularly, the decapping apparatus of the<br>
described embodiment is pneumatically driven.<br>
However, the decapping apparatus, namely the plates<br>
106 and 107 could also be driven by means of<br>
