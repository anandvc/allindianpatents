				<td>FAST-DISPERSING DOSAGE FORMS COiNTAlNING FISH GELATIN<br>
Technical Field<br>
This invention relates to fasc-dispersing pharmaceutical compositions. In particular, the invention relates :o freezs-dried fast-dispersing dosage forms containing fish gelatin.<br>
Backpround of the Invention<br>
Fast-dispersing dosage forms which are designed co release the active ingredient in ihe oral cavity are well known and can be used co deliver a wide range of drugs. Many such fast-dispersing dosage forms utilize gelacin as a carrier. Gelatin B, P., which is normally utilized in such formulations, is defined as a pro win obtained by partial hydrolysis of animal collagenous tissues such as skin, tendons, ligaments and bones, with boiling water. However, such mammalian derived gelacin has an unpleasant caste and thus necessitates the use of sweeteners and flavors in such fast-dispersing dosage forms 10 mask the casce of the gelatin in addition to any sweeteners  '• and flavors which may be required to mask the taste of the active ingredient. Moreover, when conventional mammalian derived gelacin is used in the production of such fast-dispersing dosage forms, ic is necessary to heac the gelatin solution co 60°C in order to effect solution. This heating step increases processing times and incurs heating costs thereby increasing the overall coses of die process,<br><br>

Published Internationa! Application No. WO 94/14422 describes a process for drying frozen discrete units in which the solvent is removed under conditions whereby the solvent is evaporated from the solid through, the liquid phase lo a gas, rather than subliming from a solid to a gas as in lyophilization. This is achieved by vacuum drying at a temperature below che equilibrium freezing point of the composition-at which point the solvent (such as water) changes phase.<br>
While the prior art is replete with methods and techniques for the preparation of rapidly dispersing dosage forms, it has failed to consider the benefits associated with the use offish gelatin, especially non-gelling, non-hydrolyzed fish gelatin, in such dosage forms.- The pharmaceutical industry would be able to avoid the use of mammalian derivad gelatin due to caste considerations. Thus, there exists the need for improved fast-dispersing dosage forms which are designed to quickly release the active ingredient in che oral cavity chat avoid the use of mammalian derived gelatin.<br><br>
Summary of the Invention	.<br>
[t has now been found that many of the problems associated with the use of mammalian-derived gelatin can be overcome if fish gelatin, especially non-gelling fish gelatin, is utilized for preparing fast-dispersing dosage forms, Surprisingly, the non-gelling form offish gelatin from sources such as cold water fish, can be advantageously used in rapidly disintegrating dosage forms. Moreover, a number of further advantages have been identified in terms of processing parameters and che qualities of the resultant product.<br>
The present invention discloses a pharmaceutical composition comprising a carrier and an active ingredienc (e.g., drug, compound, and the like) wherein the carrier is fish gelatin and the composition is in the form of a fast-dispersing dosage form which releases the active ingredient rapidly on contact with a fluid (e.g., saliva, bodily fluids, water, and the like). Preferably, the composition is designed for oral administration and releases the active ingredient rapidly in che oral cavjry. In another embodiment, the composition can be applied topically, for instance, to wet skin, or dispersed or dissolved in a liquid prior to topical or oral administration.<br>
The invention also discloses a process for preparing fast-dispersing dosage forms by freeze-drying or lyophilizing a combination of the active ingredient and fish gelatin (e.g., non-gelling fish gelatin).<br>
The invention further includes a method of using fish gelatin (e.g., non-gelling fish gelatin) in pharmaceutical compositions in fast dispersing dosage form, and in particular, freeze dried fast-dispersing dosage forms.<br><br>
En a preferred embodiment, (he composition of (he invention is a solid fast-dispersing dosage form containing a network of che active ingredient and a water-soluble or wacer-dispersible carrier comprising fish gelatin (e.g.- non-gelling fish gelatin), the network having^been obtained by subliming solvent from a composition in the solid state containing the active ingredient and a solution or dispersion of the carrier in a solvent.<br>
The fish gelatin used in accordance with tire invention is preferably obtained from cold water fish sources and is the non-gelling type offish gelatin. More preferably, the non-hydrolyzed form of non-gelling fish gelatin is used. In an alternative embodiment, spray-dried non-hydrolyzed non-gcllir.g fish gelatin can be used.<br>
Detailed Description of.che Invention<br>
The phrase "fast-dispersing dosage form" refers to compositions which disintegrate or disperse within 1 to 60 seconds, preferably I to 30 seconds, more preferably 1 co 10 seconds and parn'cularly 2 to 8 seconds, afcer being placed in contact with a fluid." The fluid is preferably that found in the oral cavity, i.e., saliva, as with oral administration. In a general context, the phrase encompasses all the previously mentioned dosage forms described herein as well as any other equivalent dosage form.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the compositions ofHhe invention are solid fast-dispersing dosage forms comprising a solid network of the active ingredient and a<br><br>
water-soluble or water-dispersible carrier containing fish gelatin. Accordingly, (he carrier is inert cowards the active ingredient, The network is obtained by subliming solvent from a composition in the solid state, the composition comprising the active ingredient and a solution of the carrier in the solvent. The dosage forms according to the invention can be prepared according to the process disclosed in Gregory ec al., U.K. Patent No. 1,548,022 using fish gelatin as the carrier.<br>
Accordingly, an initial composition (or astmixcure) comprising the active ingredient and a solution of the fish gelatin carrier in a solvent is prepared followed by sublimation. The sublimation is preferably carried out by freeze drying the composition. The composition can be contained in a mold during the freeze-drying process to produce a solid form in any desired shape. The mold can be cooled using liquid nitrogen or solid carbon dioxide in a preliminary step prior to the deposition of the composition therein. After freezing the mold and composition, they are next subjected to reduced pressure and, if desired, controlled application of heat to aid in sublimation of solvent. The reduced pressure applied in the process can be below about 4 mm Hg,-preferably below about 0.3 mm Hg. The freeze dried compositions can then be removed from the mold if desired or stored therein until later use.<br>
When the process is used with active ingredients and fish gelatin as the carrier, a solid fast-dispersing dosage form is produced having the advantages associated with the use of fish gelatin described herein. Generally, fish gelatin is categorized as being from cold water and warm water fish sources and as being of the gelling or non-gelling variety. The non-gelling variety of fish gelatin, in comparison co gelling fish<br><br>
gelacin and bovine gelacin, concains lower praline and hydroxyproline amino acid concenc. which are known to be associated ^ich cross-linking properties and gelling ability. Non-gelling fish gelacin can remain at solution concentrations of up to about 40% 25 well as in cemperacures as low as 20° C. The fish gelacin used in accordance wich the invention is preferably obtained from cold wacer fish sources and is the non-gelling cype offish gelacin. More preferably, the non-hydrolyzed form of non-gelling fish gelacin is used. In an alternative embodiment', spray-dried non-hydrolyzed non-gelling fish gelatin can be used. Fish gelacins^suicable for use in the invention can be obtained from Croda Colloids Led. (Chesire, England), for example.<br><br>

The precise quantity of active ingredient will vary according 10 ihe particular drug selected and the patient's needs. However, the active ingredient can be generally present in an amount from about 0.2% to about 95%, typically from about 1% to about 20%. by weight of the composition of the dried dosage form. The invention is further illustrated by the following Examples.<br>
EXAMPLE 1 Preparation, of a Placebo. Fast-Dispersing Dosage Form using,Fish Gelatin<br>
Spray-dried fish gelatin (4 g) and maanilol (3 g) were added to a glass beaker.<br>
-        .	/<br>
Purified water (93 g) was then added and solution effected by srirring using a magnetic follower. No heating was required. A Gilson pipette was then used to deliver 500 mg of this solution into each one of a series ofpre-formed blister pockets having a pocket diameter of about 16 mm. The blister laminate comprised PVC coated wich P VdC. The dosed units were then frozen at a temperature of-110° C in a freeze tunnel wich a residence time of 3.2 minutes and the frozen units'were then held in an upright frsezer for a time greater than 1.5 hours at a temperature of-25° C (±5° C). The units were then freeze-dried overnight with an initial shelf temperature of-10° C rising to +20° C at a pressure of 0.5 mbar. The units were checked "for moisture prior to unloading by the drying trace and by the pressurized moisture check. The resultant units had the following composition:<br><br>

COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE A<br>
Preparation of a Placgbo Fast-Dispersing Dosage Form using •    Alkaline Bovine Hide Gelatin<br>
/<br>
Alkaline bovine hide gelatin (4 g) was added to purified water (93 g) in a glass beaker and evenly heaced co 60" C while constantly stirring with a magnetic follower. Care was taken to ensure chat all the gelatin had dissolved. The mix was then cooled to 2. remperacure of 25° C by means of a water bach before the addition of mannitol (3 g). Whan the manrtitol had dissolved, stirring was continued for 1 hour at ambient conditions. This solution was then dosed into blister pockets, frozen, stored and freeze-dried as described in Example I above. The resultant unics had the following composition:<br><br>
(Table Remove)<br>
ihe following additional comparative examples were prepared using the process described in Comparative Example A.<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE B Preparation ofa Placebo Fast-Dispersing Dosage Form using Pig Skin Gelatin<br>
A fast-dispersing dosage form using pig skin gelatin was prepared in a manner similar co chat found in Comparative Example A,, and the resulranc units had the<br>

EXAMPLE!<br>
Comoarauya Tensile Strenach and Dispersion Testing<br>
The units produced in Example 1 and che Comparative Examples A through C<br>
were subjected to tensile strength and disintegration ces:s according co methods<br>
conforming co the USP monograph requirements. /Vn additional dispersion test was<br>
also cam'ed ouc Co identify any subtle differences which may not be apparent from the<br>
disintegration test.	<br>
The dispersion test was performed by^adding 500 ml volume of purified water into a glass beaker. The water was then heated to a temperature of 37° C. The units were carefully dropped onto the surface of the water and the time taken to fully disperse noted. The warer was then changed for subsequent unit testing.<br>
Results<br>
The units produced in Example \ exhibited a disintegration time of 0.85 seconds and gave a mean tensile strength value of 0.267 N mm"2. In contrast, the units produced in Comparative Example A exhibited a disintegration time of 4.28 seconds and had a mean tensile strength value of 0.408 N mm'1. The disp'ersion test confirmed these results, The units produced in Comparative Examples B and C exhibited a mean tensile strength of 0.407 N mm"2 and 0.433 N mm"2 respectively. In addition, it was noted that the units produced in Example 1 had no unpleasant smelJ or taste and a better mouth-feel than the units produced in the Comparative Examples.<br>
In particular, the units of Comparative Examples B and C were slow 10 disperse and had a gummy mouth-feel.<br>
It is apparent from the above that fasi-dispersing dosage forms produced using fish gelatin have a number of advantages over chose produced using mamrnaljan-derived gelatin. For instance, such dosage forms containing fish gelacin have a faster disintegration time, a better caste and a better mouth-feel than dosage forms containing mammalian derived gelacin. Moreover, there is no need for sweeteners and flavors to be added to mask the taste or sjmell of the gelatin since fish gelatin has an acceptable taste and smell. Thus, although some sweeteners and flavors may still be required co mask the taste of an unpalatable active ingrediam, the overall quantity of sweeteners and flavors can be greatly reduced with attendant cost benefits. In addition, since fish gelacin is soluble in cold water, che heating step, which is required when mammalian derived gelatin is used, can be omirced thereby producing cost savings in heating costs and shorter mixing times. The overall process is therefore more controllable when fish gelatin is used in place of mammalian derived gelatin, The following examples funher exemplify formulations which can be prepared using the process described in Example 1.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
Fasc-Dispenine Dosage Form using Fish Gelacin with Dextromechofphan as (he Acr.ive_In_gTgdiem<br><br>
(Table Remove)<br>
A mean Tensile strength value of 0.206 N mm2 was obcained for chese dosage forms, svith a disintegration time of 0.78 seconds.<br>
EXAMPLE 4 Fasi-Dispersing_pQsage Form using Fish Gelatin<br><br>
(Table Remove)<br>
These units had a mean Tensile strength value of 0.269 N mm2, wich a disintegration time of under 2 seconds.<br>
EXAMPLE 5 Testing of "Gelling" Fish Gejatin<br>
A formulation containing "gelling" fish sslacin was prepared and evaluated for disintegration time and mouth feel. Gelatin, mannicol and purified water were weighed into plastic vessels, The gelatin and mannitol were added co che vortex of continually stirred purified water, and the mixture was heated to a temperature of 60°C in order to effect solution of che gelatin. Once dissolved, the solution was then cooled to a temperature of about 23,4" C prior co dosing. Aliquocs of 500 mg were dosed into pre-forrned blister pockets and frozen, stored and frceze-dried.<br>
A total batch of 100 grams was prepared containing the following formulation:<br>
Ingredient	|	Amount (% by weight)<br><br>
(Table Remove)<br>
The dosage forms were analyzed for disintegration time and mouth feel. Disincegration time of che samples was measured according to USP methods, The samples had disintegration times of greater than 5 seconds. The mouth fe'el of the samples was found co be slow to disperse, "gummy" in nature, and overall unsatisfactory.<br><br>
Industrial Appiicabjlirv<br>
The pharmaceutical industry is constantly searching for improved dosage forms chac are economical co produce and avoid problems associated «/ith mammalian gelacin, The dosage forms according co the presenc invention addresses these needs and does so with superior results.<br>
The invention has bean described with reference co various specific and<br>
i<br>
preferred embodimencs and techniques. However./ ic should be understood chac many variacions and modifications can be made while remaining within the spiric and scope of the invention.<br><br><br>
