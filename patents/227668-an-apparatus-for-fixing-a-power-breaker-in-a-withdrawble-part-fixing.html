				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to an apparatus for fixing a power breaker in a<br>
withdrawable-part rack having a means for moving the power breaker relative to<br>
the withdrawable-part rack and at least one locking means, associated with the<br>
withdrawable-part rack, for the power breaker said locking means being<br>
connected to a control rod, which is arranged movably on the withdrawable-part<br>
rack, for the purpose of moving it from a latched position to an unlatched<br>
position or vice versa.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A power breaker, which can be moved into a withdrawable-part rack, is shown,<br>
for example, in DE 35 44 227 Al. In a similar manner, high-voltage power<br>
breakers in the medium-voltage range can also be moved by them being placed<br>
on a carriage, which can be moved by means of a crankshaft drive, cf. for<br>
example DE 100 06 427 C2.<br>
Power breakers, which can be inserted in a withdrawable-part rack, need to be<br>
able to be fixed in the withdrawable-part rack, in particular in the case of very<br>
high short-circuit currents, in order to be able to ensure functional reliability<br>
during operation of the power breaker. As a result of the arrangement of the<br>
current path in the power breaker, forces result which would produce a torque<br>
about the insertion shaft and would thus push the power breaker out of the<br>
withdrawable-part rack if insufficient fixing were provided. As a result, the region<br><br>
of overlap between the insertion blades of the power breaker in the isolating<br>
contact systems of the withdrawable-part rack would be reduced or eliminated.<br>
The formation of an arc associated with this may result in failure or destruction<br>
of the device.<br>
In order to be able to fix the power breaker securely in the withdrawable-part<br>
rack, it is known to latch the power breaker in the withdrawable-part rack by<br>
means of a latching apparatus. In this case, holding systems are known which<br>
lock the power breaker using relatively short lever arms. If a strong force is<br>
introduced, the power breaker accordingly tends towards tipping movements,<br>
with the result that the mentioned disadvantages occur.<br>
DE 92 12 149 Ul also discloses a device for fixing a power breaker provided with<br>
a partition plate and in which a blocking lever, which is fixed on the<br>
withdrawable-part rack, can be brought by hand into a latched or an unlatched<br>
position, and the power breaker is fixed in the latched position by means of a<br>
locking hook. The locking hook prevents a possible tipping movement of the<br>
power breaker.<br>
Analogous locking for a withdrawable-part rack equipped with means for<br>
inserting the power breaker does not, however, have to be undertaken by hand,<br>
which would then have the hidden risk of locking being forgotten.<br>
SUMMARY OF THâ‚¬ INVENTION<br>
It is therefore the object of the present invention to provide an<br><br>
apparatus for fixing a power breaker in a withdrawable-part rack, which fixes the<br>
power breaker securely in the withdrawable-part rack even in the event of very<br>
high forces and which acts automatically, that is without any additional effort on<br>
the part of the operator, when the power breaker is inserted in the<br>
withdrawable-part rack.<br>
According to the invention, this object is achieved by an apparatus for fixing a<br>
power breaker in a withdrawable-part rack having the features mentioned in<br>
claim 1. For this purpose, the control rod interacts with the means for moving<br>
the power breaker relative to the withdrawable-part rack, and the apparatus<br>
comprises a release device, which can be moved by way of the movement of the<br>
power breaker from a blocked position for the control rod to a released position<br>
for the control rod or vice versa, such that the locking means moves to the<br>
unlatched position when the power breaker is inserted and withdrawn from the<br>
withdrawable-part rack, and the control rod is held in the blocked position by the<br>
release means, and, when the power breaker is inserted in the withdrawable-<br>
part rack, the released position for the control rod for triggering the movement<br>
of the locking means to the latched position is assumed by the release means<br>
only shortly before the inserted position of the power breaker.<br>
The apparatus according to the invention for fixing a power breaker in a<br>
withdrawable-part rack advantageously makes it possible for the power breaker<br>
to be locked in a simple and secure manner. As a result of the fact that this<br>
apparatus interacts with a means for moving the power breaker relative to the<br>
withdrawable-part rack, it is particularly advantageous to fix the power breaker<br>
as a result of the movement of the power breaker into the withdrawable-part<br><br>
rack and also to unlatch the power breaker owing to the withdrawal of the power<br>
breaker from the withdrawable-part rack. This means that no additional<br>
procedures by an operator are required for fixing the power breaker. This is<br>
desirable, inter alia, since the additional latching of the power breaker could be<br>
forgotten or carried out erroneously.<br>
In one preferred embodiment, the locking means is in the form of a hook.<br>
Furthermore, the locking means is advantageously mounted on the<br>
withdrawable-part rack such that it can rotate and is arranged such that it can<br>
engage in an attachment locked on the power breaker. The bearing point is in<br>
this case selected such that, on the action of tipping forces which are produced<br>
owing to the arrangement of the current path in the power breaker, a closing<br>
moment of the locking means in the attachment of the power breaker and thus<br>
on the power breaker is always set.<br>
In one particularly preferred embodiment, the locking means is a downwardly<br>
formed hook, which engages in an insert arranged in a force-fitting manner on<br>
the power breaker and thus holds the power breaker securely in the<br>
withdrawable-part rack even in the event of high forces.<br>
The control rod is advantageously arranged on a side wall of the withdrawable-<br>
part rack and is connected in a force-fitting manner to the locking device by<br>
means of a bolt, a sliding piece and a spring. Furthermore, the control rod which<br>
is advantageously arranged such that it can move vertically has a spring applied<br>
to it which prestresses the control rod. The means for moving the power breaker<br>
relative to the withdrawable-part rack may comprise a displacement mechanism<br><br>
having a crank handle and an insertion shaft having a crankshaft journal. The<br>
release means is advantageously a transverse slide having a blocking tab which<br>
can be latched into a notch in the control rod. The transverse slide also<br>
advantageously has a spring force applied to it.<br>
In the initial position in which the power breaker is still located outside of the<br>
withdrawable-part rack, the locking means is arranged in an unlatched position.<br>
The control rod connected to the locking means is held in a blocked position<br>
using the release means.<br>
When the power breaker is inserted in the withdrawable-part rack, the release<br>
means is caused by the power breaker, only shortly before the end of the entire<br>
displacement path, to move the control rod from a blocked position to a released<br>
position. As a result, the locking means connected to the control rod is caused to<br>
be moved from its unlatched position to a latched position. As a result, the<br>
power breaker is fixed securely in the withdrawable-part rack. When the power<br>
breaker is withdrawn from the withdrawable-part rack, on actuation of the<br>
means for moving the power breaker relative to the withdrawable-part rack the<br>
control rod is moved from the released position to the blocked position. As a<br>
result, the locking means connected to the control rod is moved from its latched<br>
position to an unlatched position and releases the power breaker which was up<br>
to that point fixed. On further actuation of the means for moving the power<br>
breaker relative to the withdrawable-part rack, the now unlatched power breaker<br>
is moved out of the withdrawable-part rack. In this case, the control rod is held<br>
in the blocked position by way of the release means, and the initial position is<br>
reached.<br><br>
Further preferred refinements of the invention result from the other features<br>
mentioned in the subclaims.<br>

DETAILED	DESCRIPTION	OF THE	EXEMPLARY<br>
EMBODIMENTS<br>
Figure 1 shows a perspective illustration of an apparatus according to the<br>
invention, which is arranged on a withdrawable-part rack 10, a power breaker 12<br>
being partially inserted in the withdrawable-part rack 10. For greater clarity, only<br>
one attachment 24 of the power breaker 12 is illustrated. The apparatus for<br>
fixing the power breaker 12 in the withdrawable-part rack 10 is fixed on the side<br>
wall of the withdrawable-part rack 10 and engages, in the latched position, in the<br>
attachment 24 of the power breaker 12. In the initial position, the control rod 14<br>
is locked in a blocked position by a transverse slide 20, with the result that a<br>
locking means 16 is located in an unlatched position. The power breaker 12 is<br>
moved into the withdrawable-part rack 10 by means of a displacement<br>
mechanism, which has a crank handle 29 and an insertion shaft 30 having a<br>
crankshaft journal 32.<br>
A locking means 16 is located at this point in time in its unlatched position. The<br>
locking means 16 is in the form of a hook and is connected in a force-fitting<br>
manner to the control rod 14 by means of a bolt 18, a sliding piece 40 and a<br>
spring 22. The control rod 14 is arranged on the withdrawable-part rack 10 such<br>
that it can move vertically. Furthermore, the control rod 14 has a spring 42<br>
which applies a force, which is directed vertically downwards, to the control rod<br>
14. The vertical position of the control rod 14 is limited in this initial position by<br>
the transverse slide 20, whose blocking tab 26 engages in a notch 36 in the<br>
control rod 14 and thus prevents a further vertical downward movement of the<br><br>
control rod 14. As a result, the locking means 16 is prevented from being moved<br>
from its unlatched position to a latched position. The transverse slide 20 likewise<br>
has a spring 28 (cf. Figure 4), by means of which the transverse slide 20 is<br>
pushed in the direction of the notch 36 in the control rod 14. In the initial<br>
position, the crankshaft journal 32 is located to the side of the insertion shaft 30.<br>
By actuating the displacement mechanism, the crankshaft journal 32 is moved<br>
upwards until it is located perpendicularly over the insertion shaft 30 in the<br>
insertion guide 44. At the same time, the power breaker 12 is moved into the<br>
withdrawable-part rack 10. The control rod 14 is moved upwards by means of<br>
the crankshaft journal 32. The locking means 16 is located on a stop 34, and the<br>
spring 42 is compressed, as illustrated in figure 2.<br>
On further insertion of the power breaker 12 in the withdrawable-part rack 10,<br>
only on the last millimeters of the entire displacement path is the transverse slide<br>
20 moved from a switch foot 38 of the power breaker 12 counter to the spring<br>
force of the spring 28, with the result that the transverse slide 20 is deflected<br>
rearwards and the left-hand, upper region of the notch 36 and thus the control<br>
rod 14 is released, as illustrated in figure 3.<br>
The control rod 14 moves downwards as a result of the release with the aid of<br>
the spring force of the spring 42. The path of the control rod 14 is limited by the<br>
upper edge of the notch 36 or the crankshaft journal 32 of the insertion shaft 30,<br>
which has moved downwards again owing to the further insertion. The<br>
downward movement of the control rod 14 causes the locking means 16, which<br>
is in the form of a hook, to be brought into its end position and to engage in the<br>
attachment 24 of the power breaker 12. As a result, the power breaker 12 is<br>
fixed securely in the withdrawable-part rack 10.<br><br>
Aside from the displacement of the power breaker 12 into the withdrawable-part<br>
rack 10, no further procedures advantageously need to be performed for the<br>
purpose of fixing the power breaker 12. Furthermore, the bearing point of the<br>
locking means 16 is selected such that, on the action of tipping forces on the<br>
power breaker 12, a closing moment of the hook-shaped locking means in the<br>
attachment 24 of the power breaker 12 is always set. The hook thus falls<br>
downwards and holds the power breaker 12 securely in the withdrawable-part<br>
rack 10.<br>
In order to unlatch and remove the power breaker 12 from the withdrawable-<br>
part rack 10, the presence of play between the crankshaft journal 32 and the<br>
insertion guide 44 is utilized. Within the first rotations of the crank handle for the<br>
insertion shaft 30 on the displacement mechanism, owing to the play no<br>
movement is produced on the power breaker 12. On these rotations of the crank<br>
handle, the crankshaft journal 32 is moved slightly upwards and lifts the control<br>
rod 14 with the locking means 16 connected thereon upwards. As a result, the<br>
locking means 16 is moved from its latched position to an unlatched position.<br>
The power breaker 12 is as-a result released and can be removed from the<br>
withdrawable-part rack 10 by further rotating the crank handle. On further<br>
rotations of the crank handle on the displacement mechanism, the crankshaft<br>
journal 32 is moved further upwards in the insertion guide and displaces the<br>
power breaker 12. On the resultant upward movement of the control rod 14, the<br>
spring 42 of the control rod 14 is stressed. At the same time, the transverse slide<br>
20 is displaced, owing to the force of the spring element 28, into the notch 36 in<br>
the control rod 14 again, as illustrated in figure 2. On further rotations of the<br>
crank handle, the crankshaft journal 32 is moved downwards again in the<br><br>
insertion guide 44, the spring 42 of the control rod 14 is relieved of stress, and<br>
the control rod 14 is again located in the initial position, as illustrated in figure 1.<br>
Figure 4 shows a schematic perspective view of an apparatus according to the<br>
invention without a withdrawable-part rack. In this case, the hook-shaped<br>
locking means 16 is connected in a force-fitting manner to the control rod 14 by<br>
means of a bolt 18, a sliding piece 40 and a spring 22 and, corresponding to the<br>
abovementioned operation, engages in the attachment 24 on displacement into<br>
the latched position if the transverse slide 20 releases the control rod 14 by the<br>
blocking tab 26 becoming unlatched from the notch 36 in the control rod 14.<br>
Figures 5 and 6 show the apparatus according to the invention for illustrative<br>
purposes together with a power breaker 12, which has been completely inserted<br>
and fixed in a withdrawable-part rack 10. In both figures, the locking means 16<br>
is located in its latched position. By actuating the crank handle, the crankshaft<br>
journal 32 is moved upwards, as a result of which the control rod 14 likewise<br>
experiences a vertical upward movement. Owing to the play between the<br>
crankshaft journal 32 and the insertion guide 44 of the displacement mechanism,<br>
the power breaker 12 initially does not move. This is not possible until the<br>
control rod 14, owing to its vertical upward movement, moves the locking means<br>
16 from the latched position to the unlatched position, and, as a result, unlatches<br>
the locking means 16 from the attachment 24 of the power breaker 12 and thus<br>
the fixing is released.<br><br>
