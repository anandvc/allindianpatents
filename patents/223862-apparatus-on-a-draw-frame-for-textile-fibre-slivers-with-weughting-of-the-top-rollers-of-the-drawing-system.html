				<td>Apparatus on a draw frame for textile fibre slivers<br>
with weighting of the top rollers of the drawing<br>
system.<br>
The invention relates to an apparatus on a draw<br>
frame for textile fibre slivers with weighting of the<br>
top rollers of the drawing system of successively<br>
arranged pairs of rollers comprising a bottom and a top<br>

which is provided at the lower end of one lateral<br>
support and is secured to the machine frame by way a<br>
bearer. A pneumatic compressed air line is located<br>
inside the crosshead and the lateral supports.<br>
This invention is based on the problem of further<br>
improving the known apparatus.<br>
The invention provides apparatus on a draw frame<br>
for textile fibre slivers with weighting of the top<br>
rollers of the drawing system of successively arranged<br>
pairs of rollers comprising a bottom and a top roller,<br>
in which, during operation, the top rollers are pressed<br>
against the bottom rollers by weighted pressure<br>
elements in pressure arms, wherein two pressure<br>
elements with a common holding element are associated<br>
with each top roller and the weighting device is<br>
removable, characterised in that at each pressure arm<br>
(lla to l1d), a respective pressure element (9; 91 to<br>
94; 9a1, 9a2; 9b1, 9b2; 9c1, 9c2; 9d1, 9d2; 13a to 13d) is<br>
rotatably or pivotally mounted at a centre of rotation<br>
(10) or a pivot bearing and the pressure elements (9;<br>
91 to 94; 9a1, 9a2; 9bl, 9b2; 9cl, 9c2; 9d1, 9d2; 13a to<br>
13d) are connected with one another by a supporting<br>
element (12; 12a to 12d).<br>
The fact that the pressure elements and the<br>
pressure channel are used as supporting structural<br>
elements enables the apparatus according to the<br>
invention to be of compact construction. In<br>
particular, it savings in space can be made both in the<br>
direction of the flow of the fibre material and in<br>
headroom.<br>
The pressure element advantageously comprises a<br>
reciprocating part, for example, a ram. The ram<br>
preferably has a circular cross-section. The pressure<br>
elements are advantageously pneumatic cylinders. The<br>
pneumatic cylinder preferably has a rectangular cross-<br>
section. The width of the pneumatic cylinder is<br>

rotation or pivot bearing is advantageously mounted in<br>
the region of the lower end of the pneumatic cylinder<br>
facing the top rollers. The pneumatic cylinder<br>
preferably has a covering. The centre of rotation and<br>
pivot bearing is advantageously arranged on the lower<br>
covering of a pneumatic cylinder. The supporting<br>
element is preferably mounted in the region of the<br>
upper end of the pneumatic cylinders remote from the<br>
top rollers. The supporting element preferably forms<br>
the upper covering of the pneumatic cylinders of a<br>
pressure arm. The supporting element advantageously<br>
forms a bridge between the pneumatic cylinders of a<br>
pressure arm. The supporting element advantageously<br>
forms a crosshead for the two pneumatic cylinders. The<br>
supporting element is advantageously hollow inside.<br>
The supporting element preferably forms a compressed<br>
air channel. The pneumatic cylinders are<br>
advantageously connected to the pressure channel. The<br>
pneumatic cylinders and the supporting element<br>
preferably form a portal-form pressure arm. The<br>
supporting element advantageously accommodates<br>
electrical leads. The pressure arm is preferably<br>
arranged in the same plane as the top roller. The<br>
longitudinal axis of the supporting element is<br>
preferably arranged parallel to the longitudinal axes<br>
of the top roller. The pneumatic cylinders are<br>
advantageously arranged perpendicular to the top<br>
roller. The pneumatic cylinders are preferably<br>

With reference to Fig.l, a drawing system S of a draw frame, for<br>
example, the Trutzcheler HSR draw frame is provided. The drawing<br>
system S is designed as a 4-over~3 drawing system, that is, it<br>
comprises three<br>
bottom rollers I, II, III (I being the bottom output<br>
roller, II the middle bottom roller, III the bottom<br>
intake roller) and four top rollers 1, 2, 3, 4.<br>
Drafting of the composite sliver 5 from a plurality of<br>
fibre slivers takes place in the drawing system S. The<br>
draft is made up from the preliminary draft and the<br>
main draft, and the roller pairs 4/III and 3/II form<br>
the preliminary drafting zone and the roller pairs 3/II<br>
and 1, 2/I form the main drafting zone. The bottom<br>
output roller I is driven by the main motor (not shown)<br>
and hence determines the rate of delivery. The bottom<br>
intake and middle bottom rollers III and II<br>
respectively are driven by a variable speed motor (not<br>
shown). The top rollers 1 to 4 are pressed against the<br>
bottom rollers I, II, III by pressure elements 91 to 94<br>
(weighting device) in pressure arms lla to l1d<br>
pivotable about pivot bearings (see Figs 3 and 4), and<br>
are hence driven by way of frictional engagement. The<br>
direction of rotation of the rollers I, II, II; 1, 2,<br>
3, 4 is indicated by curved arrows. The composite<br>
fibre sliver 5, which consists of a plurality of fibre<br>
slivers, runs in direction A. The bottom rollers I,<br>
II, III are mounted in bearers 14 (see Fig. 3) which<br>
are arranged on the machine frame 15.<br>
Referring to Fig. 2, the pneumatic cylinder 9<br>
comprises an upper cover (supporting element 12) and a<br>
lower cover 13a. The pneumatic cylinder 9 forms a<br>
cylinder unit having a cylinder cavity 17 comprising<br>
two parts 17a and 17b, in which a piston 18 is guided<br>
by means of a ram 19 in a sliding bushing 20. The<br>
roller journal 4a of the pressure roller 4 passes right<br>
through an opening in a holding plate 27 and engages in<br>
a bearing 22a. The bearing 22a receiving the pressure<br>
roller 4 extends in a space between the ram 19 and the<br>
roller journal IIIa of the bottom roller III. The<br>
bearing 22a is mounted on the cover 13a1. A diaphragm<br>
16 divides the cylinder cavity 17 into pressure<br>
regions. In order to generate pressure in the upper<br>
part of the cylinder cavity 17, compressed air p1 can<br>
be admitted to this space by means of a compressed air<br>
connection 23. Air is evacuated from the lower part of<br>
the cylinder cavity 17 through a vent bore 24.<br>
Analogously, air can be evacuated from the upper part<br>
of the cylinder cavity 17 and compressed air can be<br>
admitted to the lower part of the cylinder cavity 17.<br>
In operation, after a fibre sliver 5 has been guided<br>
over the bottom rollers I, II, III, the pressure arms<br>
11 are pivoted into the working position shown in Fig.<br>
1 and fixed in this position by a fixing device (not<br>
shown), so that the pressure rollers I, II, III are<br>
able to exert pressure. Application of pressure occurs<br>
on the one hand as a consequence of each of the rams 19<br>
being located on the corresponding bearing 22, and on<br>
the other hand in that an overpressure is generated in<br>
the void above the diaphragm 16. The ram 19 therefore<br>
presses with its other end on the bearing 22, in order<br>
to generate the said clamping between the top roller 4<br>
and the bottom roller (drive roller III). The ram 19<br>
is displaceable in the direction of the arrows D, E.<br>
Referring to Fig. 3, each top roller 1 to 4 has<br>
associated with it a respective portal-form pressure<br>
arm lla, l1b, l1c, l1d, which, seen in plan view, is<br>
oriented parallel to the longitudinal axis of the<br>
respective top roller 1 to 4. The pressure arms lla to<br>
l1d are shown in the closed position. The bottom<br>
rollers I to III are mounted in bearers 14a, 14b and<br>
14c respectively, which are displaceably mounted on the<br>
machine frame 15. At the same time, two pressure<br>
elements 9 are associated with each top roller 1 to 4<br>
and are connected with one another by a common<br>
supporting element 12.<br>
According to Fig. 4, the portal-form pressure arm<br>
lla, which consists of two lateral pneumatic cylinders<br>
9a1 and 9a2 (pressure elements), a common supporting<br>
element 12a and two cover elements 13a1 and 13a2, is<br>
associated with the top roller 4. The cover elements<br>
13a1 and 13a2 are mounted at the lower ends of the<br>
pneumatic cylinders 9a1 and 9a2 and form the lower cover<br>
thereof. The supporting element 12a is mounted at the<br>
upper ends of the pneumatic cylinders 9a1 and 9a2 and<br>
forms their upper cover. Together with the top roller<br>
4, the pressure arm lla is upwardly pivoted about a<br>
pivot bearing 10 (see Fig. 5). The cover elements 13a1<br>
and 13a2 are, seen in side view, of angular (right-<br>
angled) construction, one arm of the angle covering a<br>
respective pneumatic cylinder 9a1, 9a2. The other<br>
angle arm of the cover element 13a1 is rotatably<br>
mounted in the region of its free end at the pivot<br>
bearing 10. The other angle arm of the cover element<br>
13a2 has a locking device in the region of its free<br>
end, the locking device comprising an aperture 26,<br>
through which a sliding locking rod (not shown) mounted<br>
on the machine frame 15 engages. The pressure arm lla<br>
is shown in the opened position.<br>
Referring to Fig. 5, the lower cover element 13 of<br>
the pneumatic cylinder 9 is articulated on the bearer<br>
14 by way of a pivot bearing 10 so as to rotate in the<br>
direction of the arrows B and C.<br>
Referring to Fig. 6, the supporting element 12a<br>
consists of an extruded section, for example of<br>
aluminium, which is hollow inside and the end faces of<br>
which are closed. In the end face regions there are two<br>
openings 12', 12' in a lateral wall. This creates a<br>
channel 12'', through which compressed air p is able<br>
to pass. One connection 23 for the admission of<br>
compressed air p1 is therefore sufficient, part of the<br>
compressed air flowing into the pneumatic cylinder 9a1<br>
and the remainder flowing via the channel 12'' of the<br>
supporting member 12a into the pneumatic cylinder 9a2.<br>
The pneumatic cylinders 9a1 and 9a2 have a respective<br>
connection 24 and 25 for discharge of the compressed<br>
air p and p respectively.<br>
2 3<br>
As shown in Fig.l, a central compressed air line 28 is<br>
provided, to which four branch lines 28a to 28d leading to the<br>
pneumatic cylinders 9 to 9 are connected. The compressed air<br>
1 4<br>
line 28 is connected to a compressed air source 29.<br>
The invention has been explained with reference to an example in<br>
which a pivot bearing and a lacking device are associated with<br>
each pressure arm. The invention also includes a construction in<br>
which two combined pivot bearings and locking devices are<br>
associated with a pressure arm.<br>
The apparatus according to the invention has been illustrated by<br>
way of the example of a draw frame with pneumatic weighting of<br>
the top rollers. The invention also includes a draw frame in<br>
which the top rollers are loaded mechanically, for example, by<br>
springs.<br>
As per Fig.7,7a the gantry shaped pressure arm lla is allocated<br>
to the top roller 4. (A corresponding pressure arm 11 — not<br>
represented - is allocated to the top rollers 2 to 4.) The<br>
pressure arm lla is built up as housing 30 made out of fibre<br>
glass reinforced plastic and is manufactured through pressure die<br>
casting process. The housing 30 is an integral component which<br>
is built up iniformly and the carrier item 12a covers both the<br>
bodies of the pressure items 9a and 9a (pressure cylinder),two<br>
1 2<br>
intermediate items 31a and 31b and two rotaining items 32a and<br>
32b. The carrier item 12a is built up as one sided opended up<br>
channel with some what U-shaped cross-section,in whose inside<br>
space pneumatic pipe line 34 and electric lines 35 are assembled.<br>
The opended up side of the channel 34 can be blanked off through<br>
a removable cover which is made out of fibre glass reinforced<br>
plastic, which shows somewhat U—shaped cross section and is<br>
elastic in such a way that it is fastened through press fit to<br>
the channel 33. The housing 30 is built up in preference as a<br>
single piece. The integral housing 30, which combines all the<br>
essential items of function for the retaining and loading of<br>
respective top rollers 1 to 4, may be manufactured in this way<br>
price effectively. At the same time in a simple way the entire<br>
pressure arm lla to l1d may be rotated around the pivot bearing<br>
10 and may be unlocked through the inter lacking device 26.<br>
Corresponding to Figure 8a, 8b, a pressure push-button 37 is<br>
assembled a the intermediate item 31b, which is loaded through a<br>
compression spring 38. The pressure push button may be shifted<br>
in the direction of the arrow F,G. Furthermore, a double lever<br>
39 is brought up a the intermediate item Sib which may be rotated<br>
around a pivot bearing 40 in the direction of H, I. As per<br>
Figure 8a, the right angled projecting part of the angle arm 39b<br>
engages and holds the trunion 4ib of the bearing 22b of the top<br>
roller 4. If the pressure arm 37 as per Figure 8b is pressed in<br>
direction F against the angular arm 39a of the angle lever 39,<br>
then the angular arm 39 rotates in the direction of arrow H<br>
around the pivot bearing 40, so that the angular arm 39b releases<br>
the trunion 41b. In this way, as it is represented in Figure 9b,<br>
the top roller 4 with the bearings 22a, 22b may be removed fully<br>
out of the pressure arm lla. In Figure 9a the pressure arm lla<br>
with the top roller 4 is represented in swivelled position. At<br>
the double lever 39 two recesses 43a 43b are present, in which<br>
depending on the position equivalent engages.<br>
