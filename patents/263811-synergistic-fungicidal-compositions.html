				<td>SYNERGISTIC FUNGICIDAL COMPOSITIONS<br><br>
The present invention relates to synergistic fungicidal compositions.<br><br>
In particular, the present invention relates to new synergistic compositions capable of controlling phytopa-thogens which cause considerable economic damage to agricultural crops.<br><br>
More specifically, the present invention also relates to the use of compositions comprising mixtures based on a copper (II) salt of phosphorous acid, also called phosphite or phosphonate, with at least another metallic salt of phosphorous acid and the use of compositions comprising mixtures based on a copper (11) salt of phosphorous acid, also called phosphite or phosphonate, alone or mixed with at least another salt of a metal of phosphorous acid and one or more fungicidal compounds.<br><br>
The use of salts of phosphorous acid as fungicides is generally known in literature, for example in American patent US 4,075,324.<br><br>
The Applicant has now surprisingly found that copper (II) salts of phosphorous acid are capable of exerting a considerable synergistic effect allowing a higher fungicidal activity to be obtained, than that envisaged on the basis of the activities of single components, when applied in composition with other fungicides, in addition to providing excellent anti-resistance properties.<br><br>
As resistance phenomena can arise in nature as a result of prolonged treatment with systemic fungicides, it is always important and necessary to find synergies oriented towards anti-resistance strategies.<br><br>
More specifically, the Applicant has now surprisingly found that mixtures based on copper (II) salts of phosphorous acid and one or more salts of phosphorous acid obtained from metals other than copper, have a con-sidersible synergistic effect, allowing a higher fungicidal activity to be obtained than that envisaged on the basis of the activities of single components and are capable of effectively controlling numerous diseases which can cause damage to crops of great economic interest, such as, vines, potatoes and tobacco.<br><br>
Said mixtures also have an excellent toxicological and environmental profile, as well as the advantage of having a wider range of use and allowing the dosages of use of copper and also, possibly, of phosphorous acid, to be reduced.<br><br>
Furthermore, the Applicant has surprisingly found that said mixtures of copper (II) phosphite and other metallic phosphites, in addition to copper {II) phosphite alone, in turn demonstrate a significant synergy with numerous fungicidal products, having common biological targets with those of said copper (II) salt of phosphorous acid.<br><br>
An object of the present invention therefore relates to a fungicidal composition consisting of mixtures comprising a copper (II) salt of phosphorous acid and at least another metallic salt of phosphorous acid or consisting of mixtures comprising a copper (II) salt of phosphorous acid, alone or mixed with at least another metallic salt of phosphorous acid, and one or more fungicidal compounds.<br><br>
In particular, the metallic salt of phosphorous acid can be a salt of an alkaline, alkaline-earth metal, an ammonium salt or a salt of Fe, Mn, Zn, Ni, Al, Ti or Se.<br><br>
Within the spirit of this invention, said mixtures comprising a copper (II) salt of phosphorous acid and at least another metallic salt of phosphorous acid, can be obtained either by mixing the single salts, or by co-precipitation of said salts in a reaction mixture; in both cases, in the above mixture, the copper (II) salt of phosphorous acid and the other metallic salts of phosphorous acid can be present in any proportion, solvation state, structure and crystalline lattice composition.<br><br>
The salts of an alkaline, alkaline-earth metal, ammonium salt or salts of Fe, Mn, Zn, Ni, Al, Ti or Se, of phosphorous acid can be mono- or dibasic, or they can be mixtures of these in any proportion.<br><br>
In the fungicidal compositions according to the present invention, said mixtures can also contain salts of alkaline metals in percentages not higher than 10% by weight, such as reaction exchange salts which however do not have a direct fungicidal activity.<br><br>
As already mentioned, an extension of said synergy concept is to obtain mixtures comprising a copper (II) salt of phosphorous acid alone or in a mixture with at least another metallic salt of phosphorous acid, and with other fungicidal compounds have common biological targets with those of said copper (II) salt of phosphorous acid.<br><br><br>

Preferred f-ungicidal compositions according to the present invention can be selected from<br><br><br><br>
(1)	: dosage expressed in ppm of equivalent phosphorous acid.<br>
(2)	: dosage expressed in ppm of active ingredient<br>
(3)	: dosage expressed in ppm of equivalent metallic cop per.<br><br>
The fungicidal compositions defined as mixture 1, mixture 2, mixture 3 and mixture 4 are particularly preferred.<br><br>
when they are not commercial products, the single metallic salts of phosphorous acid can be easily obtained in aqueous solution by reaction of phosphorous acid with an inorganic base such as the hydroxide or carbonate of the desired metal, or by reaction of phosphorous acid with an inorganic base, such as sodium or potassium hydroxide and the subsequent reaction with an inorganic salt, for example, chloride, bromide or sulfate of the desired metal, as described in literature in: "GMelins Handbuch Der Anorganischen Chemie" Ed. Verlag Chemie - GMBH - Weinheim,<br><br>
The fungicidal compositions according to the present invention can be prepared as follows: the mixtures comprising a copper (11) salt of phosphorous acid and at least another metallic salt of phosphorous acid are obtained by mixing the single salts or by co-precipitation of said salts in the reaction mixture.<br><br>
In this second case, the co-precipitation of the salts is effected starting from phosphites, for example sodium, potassium phosphite, by the shifting of the metallic cation M1 with a mixture, in aqueous solution, of a copper (II) salt and the other desired metallic salt, according to scheme A:<br><br><br>
wherein M1 represents- a sodium or potassium atom, X represents a halogen, such as chlorine, bromine, iodine or a sulfate group, X1 has the same meaning as X, M2 repre-sents an alkaline earth metal, an ammonium group or a Fe, Mn, Zn, Ni, Al, Ti, Se atom; p is a number greater than 0 and lower than 100 and q is equal to 100-p.<br><br>
The co-precipitation of a copper (II) salt of phos-phorous acid and a salt of an alkaline metal of phosphorous acid is effected starting from the above alkaline salt of phosphorous acid by partial shifting of the metallic cation with a suitcible copper (11) salt according to scheme B: wherein M^, X, p and q have the meanings indicated above.<br><br>
Analogously mixtures comprising, in addition to copper, two or more metals selected from those listed above, can be prepared-<br><br>
The fungicidal compositions according to the present invention comprising:<br><br>
a)	a copper (II) salt of phosphorous mixed with at least one salt of an alkaline, alkaline earth metal, an ammonium salt or a salt of Fe, Mn, Zn, Ni, Al, Ti, Se of phosphorous acid;<br><br>
b)	a copper (II) salt of phosphorous acid alone or in a mixture with at least one salt of an alkaline, alkaline earth metal, an ammonium salt, or a salt of Fe, Mn, Zn, Ni, Al, Ti, Se of phosphorous acid, and at least one of the fungicidal compounds (l)-(34);all have a high fungicidal activity with respect to numerous fungal species.<br><br>
A further object of the present invention therefore relates to the use of a composition consisting of mixtures comprising a copper (II) salt of phosphorous acid and at least another metallic salt of phosphorous acid or the use of a composition consisting of mixtures based on a copper (11) salt of phosphorous acid, alone or mixed with at least another metallic salt of phosphorous acid and one or more fungicidal compounds, in particular one or more fungicidal compounds (l}-(34), for the control of phytopathogen fungi.<br><br>
An object of the present invention also relates to a method for the control of phytopathogen fungi in agricultural crops by the application of a fungicidal composition consisting of mixtures comprising a copper (II) salt of phosphorous acid and at least another metallic salt of phosphorous acid or by the application of a composition consisting of mixtures based on a copper (II) salt of phosphorous acid alone or in a mixture with at least another metallic salt of phosphorous and one or more fungicidal compounds, in particular one or more fungicidal compounds (1) - (34) .<br><br>
