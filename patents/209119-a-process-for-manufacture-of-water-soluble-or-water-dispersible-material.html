2. HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai - 400 020, Maharashtra, India.<br><br><br>
1.  TITLE OF INVENTION  <br>
A PROCESS FOR MANUFATURE OF WATER SOLUBLE OR <br>
WATER DISPERSIABL MATERIAL<br><br>
The  following specification particularly describes and  ascertains the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br>
Granted      13-9-2004<br><br>
-1.<br>
Treatment for Fabrics<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a material comprising a benefit agent and a deposition aid for deposition of the benefit agent onto a fabric. It further relates to a method of depositing a benefit agent from solution or dispersion, onto a fabric.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The deposition of a benefit agent onto a fabric is well known in the art. In iaundry applications typical "benefit agents" include fabric softeners and conditioners, soil release polymers, sunscreens; and the like. Deposition of a benefit agent is used, for example, in fabric treatment processes such as fabric softening to impart desirable properties to the fabric substrate.<br>
Conventionally the deposition of the benefit agent may rely upon the attractive forces between the oppositely charged substrate and the benefit agent. Typically this requires the addition of benefit agents during the rinsing step of a treatment process so as to avoid adverse effects from other charged chemical species present in the treatment compositions. For example, cationic fabric conditioners are incompatible with anionic surfactants in laundry washing compositions.<br>
Such adverse charge considerations can place severe limitations upon the inclusion of benefit agents in compositions where an active component thereof is of an opposite charge to that of the benefit agent. For example, cotton is negatively charged and thus requires a positively charged benefit agent in order for the benefit agent to be<br>
2<br><br>
affinity for the cotton so as to absorb onto it. Often the substantivity of the benefit agent is reduced and/or the deposition rate of the material is reduced because of the presence of incompatible charged species in the compositions.<br>
The deterging nature of laundry wash compositions also places severe limitations upon the inclusion of neutral but hydrophobic or oily benefit agents which are not effectively deposited in the presence of surfactant.<br>
Alternatively, when deposition of a conventional benefit agent is effected by mechanisms that do not rely upon charge interaction but upon other non-covalent forces, for example soil release polymers, other problems may occur, namely where interaction of an anionic surfactant with the benefit agent can also make the materia! so negatively charged and/or soluble as to overcome the other attractive interactions.<br>
Furthermore, there is frequently another complication in achieving optimum deposition of a benefit agent onto a fabric, in that, the need for solubility of the benefit agent in the medium used to treat the substrate is in principle, incompatible with the requirement for of the benefit agent to deposit/adsorb onto the substrate.<br>
The present invention is directed towards materials for solving one or more of the above problems.<br>
WO-A-98/00500 discloses detergent compositions comprising a peptide or protein deposition aid having a high affinity for fibres or a surface, and a benefit agent attached/adsorbed to the deposition aid. However, the peptide or protein is a relatively expensive material and the need still exists to find a more cost effective alternative material as a vehicle for depositing a benefit agent.<br>
-3-<br><br>
Our unpublished copending European Patent Application No. 98300292.4 discloses polysaccharide or oligosaccharide conjugates with an attached entity (e.g. a protein or an enzyme) having a molecular weight of at least 5,000. Although the poly/oligosaccharide is capable of binding to cellulose, there is no teaching of the molecular requirements for optimising the balance between water solubility and fabric affinity.<br>
GB-A-948 678 discloses a process for dyeing and printing textiles using an aqueous preparation containing organic dyestuff residues linked by a covalent bond to high molecular weight polymers such as cellulose ethers, cellulose derivatives, starches, gums and other related naturally occurring polymers. Cellulose derivatives with a degree of substitution of 0.1 for carboxymethyi substituents are recited explicitly. However, these carboxymethyi groups and the dyestuff residues are".not "benefit agent groups" within the sense intended herein.<br>
US-A-4 668 779 discloses a gel in the form of a complex between a metallic oxide and a semi-synthetic polygalactan. This is described for use in microbiological analysis. There is no disclosure of chemical bonding between a substance and the polysaccharide and certainly no substituent group which is in any way a benefit agent group for conferring a benefit to a fabric.<br>
US-A-5 160 641 and US-A-5 540 850 disclose cellulose ether derivatives for use as anti-redeposition agents in fabric washing compositions. Substantially all of the saccharide rings are substituted. Furthermore, there is no mention of substituents which are themselves, benefit agent groups.<br>
WO-A-95/30042 discloses a gel composition for use in the manufacture of treated fabrics. It comprises a cellulose based carrier with a solvent and a material for conferring a speciality finish, e.g. waterproofing, softening or anti-static effect. However, the speciality finish agent is not bonded to the cellulosic gel Further, there is<br><br><br><br>
-4-<br>
no disclosure or suggestion of use during washing, rinsing or drying of fabric by a consumer.<br>
WO-A-98/29528 discloses cellulose ethers in which some substituents are (poly)alkoxyiated, analogues of the latter in which the (poly)alkoxylated groups are terminated with a cationic moiety in the form of a quaternary ammonium group, and cellulose ethers in which some substituents are carboxyiic acids in the salt form (i.e. the materials are essentially carboxymethylcellulose variants). As defined by the general formulae in WO-A-98/29528, none of these molecules has regions of unsubstitution, as required by the present invention.<br>
WO-A-99/14245 discloses laundry detergent compositions containing cellulosic based polymers to provide appearance and integrity benefits to fabrics. These polymers are cellulosic polymers in which the saccharide rings have pendant oxygen atoms to which substituents "R" can be hydrogen, lower alkyl or alkylene linkages terminated by carboxyiic acid, ester or amide groups. Optionally, up to five alkyleneoxy groups may¬be interspersed between the groups are the respective oxygen atom. WO-A-99/14295 discloses structures analogous to those described in WO-A-99/14245 but in one alternative, the substituents "R" together with the oxygen on the saccharide ring, constitute pendant half-esters of certain dicarboxylic acids. As described in both of these documents, none of the pendant groups is a benefit agent group.<br>
The present invention relates to materials for achieving initial solubility or dispersibility in the medium used to treat the fabric and effective deposition of one or more benefit-endowing groups thereon.<br>
Definition of the Invention<br>
Accordingly, a first aspect of the present invention provides a water-soluble or water-dispersible material for deposition onto a fabric substrate during a wash and/or rinse<br>

and/or drying process, wherein the material comprises a B1-4 -linked polysaccharide structure having at least one substituent benefit agent group and optionally, one or more other substituent groups, wherein the average degree of substitution of all substituent groups is from 0.01 to 1.2, preferably from 0.1 to 1.2, more preferably from 0.4 to 1.2, the polysaccharide structure having one or more regions with at least 3, preferably at least 4 consecutive unsubstituted saccharide rings.<br>
A second aspect of the present invention also provides a method of depositing a benefit agent onto a fabric by its incorporation in a material according to the first aspect of the invention and applying said material to the fabric.<br>
A third aspect of the present invention also provides compositions comprising a material according to the first aspect of the present invention. In particular, such compositions preferably comprise one or more surfactants.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention.<br>
The Material<br>
The material of the present invention is water-soluble or water-dispersible in nature and comprises a Gj^-linked polysaccharide structure and at least one substituent benefit agent for deposition onto a fabric during a treatment process.<br>
A polysaccharide comprises a plurality of saccharide rings which have pendant hydroxyl groups The benefit agent group(s) and optionally, any other substituent(s) can be bonded chemically to these hydroxyl groups by any means described hereinbelow. The "degree of substitution" means the average number of substituents per saccharide ring for the totality of polysaccharide molecules in the sample and is determined for all saccharide rings whether they form part of a linear backbone or are themselves pendant side groups in the polysaccharide.<br>
-6-<br><br>
Preferably, the substituent benefit agent group(s) is/are attached to the polysaccharide by a hydrolytically stable bond. That means that the bonding of the substituted benefit agent(s) should be sufficiently stable so as not to undergo substantial hydrolysis in the environment of the treatment process for the duration of that process. For example, in laundry cleaning applications, the material should be sufficiently stable so that the bond between the benefit and deposition enhancing part does not undergo hydrolysis in the wash liquor, at the wash temperature, before the benefit agent has been deposited onto the fabric.<br>
Preferably, the bond between the substituent benefit agent(s) and the polysaccharide is such that the decay rate constant (kd) of the material in an aqueous solution at 0.03 wt% of the material together with 0.1 wt% of anionic surfactant at a temperature of 40°C at a pH of 10.5 is such that k^IO"Y1.<br>
By water-soluble, as used herein, what is meant is that the material forms an isotropic solution on addition to water or another aqueous solution.<br>
By water-dispersible, as used herein, what is meant is that the material forms a finely divided suspension on addition to water or another aqueous solution.<br>
Deposition onto a substrate includes deposition by adsorption, co-crystallisation, entrapment and/or adhesion.<br>
Polysaccharide<br>
The p-l,4-linked polysaccharide structure is chosen for having an affinity for cellulose, viscose and similar fibres. Suitable such polysaccharides include cellulose, mannan and glucomannan. It may be straight or branched. Many naturally occurring polysaccharides have at least some degree of branching, or at any rate, at least some<br>
7<br><br>
saccharide rings are in the form of pendant side groups on a main polysaccharide backbone. The polysaccharide may be charged or uncharged, although uncharged types are generally preferred.<br>
The polysaccharide may be a synthetic polysaccharide, a naturally occurring polysaccharide or a modified naturally occurring polysaccharide. Preferably, it has a weight average molecular weight (Mw), as determined by GPC, of at least 1,000. In the case of naturally occurring polysaccharides, the Mw range will be typically from 100,000 to 2,000,000. For synthetic or modified naturally occurring materials, the Mw will typically be from 10,000 to 50,000.<br>
Preferably, at least 5% of the saccharide rings are in the consecutive unsubstituted region(s). Most preferably, at "east 80% of the unsubstituted region(s) contain no more than 100, especially no more than 50 consecutive unsubstituted saccharide rings. For example, no more than 50% of the saccharide rings are in such regions. Also, for example, no region may have more than 100 (more preferably more than 50) consecutive unsubstituted saccharide rings.<br>
Benefit Agent Group<br>
The benefit agent group may be any group which is used to impart desirable properties to the fabric upon which the material of the present invention is to be deposited. In practice, a material according to the present invention may comprise two or more benefit agent groups on the same molecule, either of the same kind or of different kinds.<br>
Preferably, the benefit agent group(s) is/are selected from any of the following:-<br>

It is preferred for the ester-linked quaternary ammonium compounds to contain two or more ester groups. In both monoester and the diester quaternary ammonium compounds it is preferred if the ester group(s) is a linking group between the nitrogen atom and an alkyl group. The ester groups(s) are preferably attached to the nitrogen atom via another hydrocarbyl group.<br>

More preferably, the quaternary ammonium material comprises a compound having two long chain alkyl or alkenyl chains with an average chain length equal to or greater than C14. Even more preferably each chain has an average chain length equal to or greater than C16. Most preferably at least 50°/#of each long chain alkyl or alkenyl group has a chain length of Clg. It is preferred if the long chain alkyi or alkenyl groups are predominantly linear.<br>
It is particularly advantageous if the cationic softening compound is a quaternary ammonium compound with two Cn-C22 alkyl or alkenyl groups connected to a quaternary ammonium group via at least one ester link, preferably two ester links, or else a compound with a single long chain with an average chain length greater than or equal to C2o- Examples of cationic softeners are described in US-A-4 137 180 and WO-A-93/23510.<br>
The most preferred type of ester-linked quaternary ammonium material that can be used as benefit agent group(s) is represented by the formula (A):<br>

Preferably these materials comprise small amounts of the corresponding monoester as described in US-A-4 137 180 for example 1-hardened tallow-oyloxy-2-hydroxy-3-trimethylammonium propane chloride.<br>
Another class of preferred ester-linked quaternary ammonium materials for use as benefit agent group(s) can be represented by the formula:<br>

Another preferred class of quaternary ammonium cationic fabric softening agent for use as the benefit agent group(s)is defined by formula (C)&gt;<br>
(C) <br>
where R , R and X are as hereinbefore defined.<br>
A preferred material of formula (C) is di-hardened tallow-diethyl ammonium chloride, sold under the Trademark Arquad 2HT.<br>
It is also possible to use certain mono-alkyl cationic surfactants which on their own can be used in mam-wash compositions for fabrics. Cationic surfactants that may be used include quaternary ammonium salts of the general formula R1R2R3R4N X" wherein the R groups are long or short hydrocarbon chains, typically alkyl, hydroxyalkyl or ethoxylated alkyl groups, and X is a counter-ion (for example, compounds in which R, is  a C8.C22 alkyl group, preferably a C8-C10 or C12-C14 alkyl group, R2 is a methyl group, and R3 and R4, which may be the same or different, are methyl or hydroxyethyl groups); and cationic esters (for example, choline esters).<br>
12<br><br>
If the fabric softening and/or conditioning group(s) is/are silicones, these may for example be selected from those disclosed in GB-A-1 549 180, EP-A-459 821 and EP-A-459 822. However, these silicones if used for other benefits listed under the class (b) above, can be regarded as "lubricants". Other suitable lubricants include any of those known for use as dye bath lubricants in the textile industry.<br>
Suitable photofading inhibitors of the sunscreenAJV inhibitor type are preferably molecules with an extinction co-efficient greater than 2000 1 mol" cm" at a wavelength of maximal absorption. Typically for a/sunscreen maximal absorption occurs at wavelengths of 290-370 nm, more usually 310-350 nm, especially 330-350 nm.<br>
Examples of suitable sunscreens are given in Cosmetic Science and Technology Series, Vol. 15; Sunscreens; 2nd edition; edited by Lowe, Shoath and Pathak; Cosmetics and Toiletries; Vol. 102; March 1987; pages 21-39; and Evolution of Modern Swiscreen Chemicals; pages 3-35 both by N.A. Sa2rth.<br>
In particular, suitable sunscreens include carboxylic acids or carboxylic acid derivatives, for example acrylates, cinnamates and benzoates or derivatives thereof, such as 4-methoxy cinnamate salicylates, PABA, 4-acetoxy benzoate dibenzoylmethanes, phenyl benzoimidazoles, aminobenzoates, benzotriazoles and benzophenones.<br>

Suitable fungicides include 6-acetoxy-2,4-dimethyl-m-dioxane, diiodomethyl-p-tolysulphone4,4-dimethyloxaolidine, hexahydro-l,3,5-tris(2-hydroxyethyl)-s-triazine,<br>
-13-<br><br>
sodium dimethyldithiocarbamate, sodium 2-mercaptobenzothioazole, zinc dimethyldithiocarbamate, zinc 2-mercaptobenzothiazole, sodium 2-pyridinethiol-l-oxide, sodium 2-pyridinethiol-l-oxide and N-trichloromethylthio-4-cyclohexene-l,2-dicarboximide.<br>
Suitable insect repellents include N-alkyl neoalkanamides wherein the alkyl is of 1 to 4 carbon atoms and the neoalkanoyl moiety is of 7 to 14 carbon atoms preferably N-methyl neodecanamide; N,N-diethyl meta toiuamide (DEET), 2-Hydroxyethyl-n-octyl sulphide (MGK 874); N-Octyl bicycloheptene dicarboximide (MGK 264); hexahydrodibenzofuran (MGK 11), Di-n-propyl isocinchomerate (MGK 326); 2-Ethyl-1,3-hexanediol, 2-(n-butyl)-2-ethyl-l,3-propanedioI, dimethyl phthaiate, dibutyl succinate, piperonyl butoxide, pyrethrum, Conimint, Peppermint, American spearmint, Scotch spearmint, Lemon oil, Citronella, cedanvood oil, pine oil, Limonene, carvone. Eucalyptol, Linalool, Gum Camphor, terpineol and fencholic acid.<br>
Suitable perfumes are commercially available and have an undisclosed molecular structure.<br>
Other substituents<br>
In addition to the benefit agent group(s), the materials according to the present invention optionally may also have one or more other pendant groups. Those are also taken into account when determining the degree of substitution. These may be the same or different and may for example be non-functional groups which are present as artefacts in the naturally occurring material or from the process used to obtain a synthetic or modified naturally occurring material. However, it is possible for one or more of the non-benefit agent pendant groups to be provided for other purposes, e.g. for enhancing the solubility of the molecule. Examples of solubility enhancing substituents include carboxyl, sulphonyl, hydroxy], (poly)ethyleneoxy- and/or (poly)propyleneoxy-containing groups, as well as amine groups.<br>
-  14<br><br><br>
The other pendant groups preferably constitute from 0% to 65%, more preferably from 0% to 30% (e.g. from 0% to 5%) of the total number of pendant groups. The minimum number of the other pendant groups may, for example, be 0.1% or 1% of the total. The water-solubilising groups could comprise from 0% to 100% of those other groups but preferably from 0% to 20%, more preferably from 0% to 10%, still more preferably from 0% to 5% of the total number of other pendant groups.<br>
Synthetic Routes<br>
If the benefit is attached to the deposition polysaccharide this may be chemically bonded via a linking agent. However, direct chemical bonding may also be used, as described in more detail hereinbelovv.<br>
Suitable linking agents are molecules which show a high affinity for the benefit agent group. It is preferred if the linking agent is covalently attached to the backbone of the deposition enhancing part. It is also advantageous if the linking agent is covalently bound to the benefit agent group.<br>
There are basically two general methods for preparing a water-soluble or water dispersable material comprising a J3]_4 -linked polysaccharide and a substituent benefit agent.<br>
According to one such method, the benefit agent(s) is/are grafted onto the polysaccharide.<br>
In a second alternative method, the benefit agent is grafted onto a precursor of the B1-4 -linked polysaccharide; and then the precursor is converted into the desired (modified) polysaccharide.<br>
-15<br><br>
For both methods, the general method for preparing the polysaccharide may be achieved by a number of different synthetic routes, for example:-<br>
(a)	polymerisation of suitable monomers, for example, enzymatic polymerisation of saccharides, e.g. per S. Shoda, &amp; S. Kobayashi, Makromol. Symp. 1995, 99, 179-184 or oligosaccharide synthesis by orthogonal glycosylation e.g. per H. Paulsen, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1995, 34, 1432-1434.;<br>
(b)	derivatisation of a polysaccharide chain (either naturally occurring, especially polysaccharides, especially beta-l,4-lrnked polysaccharides, especially cellulose, mannan, glucomannan, galactomannan, xyloglucan; or synthetic polymers) up to the required degree of substitution with functional groups, using a reagent (especially acid haiides, especially carboxylic acid haiides, anhydrides, carboxylic acid anhydrides, carboxylic acids, carbonates) in a solvent which either dissolves the backbone, swells the backbone, or does riot swell the backbone but dissolves or swells the product).<br><br>
(c)	hydrolysis of polymer derivatives (especially esters) down to the required degree of substitution; or<br>
(d)	a combination of any two or more of routes (a)-(c).<br>
Many suitable B1-4 -linked polysaccharides are commercially available.<br>
The degree and pattern of substitution from routes (a) or (c) may be subsequently altered by partial removal of functional groups by hydrolysis or solvolysis or other cleavage. In addition, or alternatively, the degree of polymerisation of the polysaccharide may be reduced before, during, or after the derivatisation with functional groups. For example, the relative proportions of reactants and/or the reaction time can be used to control the degree of substitution. The number of unsubstituted regions may be controlled by choice of the solvent in which the reaction(s) is/are<br><br>
16<br><br>
- 16-<br>
performed, for example exploiting the polarity of the solvent and/or the degree to which reactant are soluble or misable in it (i.e. the degree to which the reaction mixture is homogenous or heterogenous). These techniques and how to apply then will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art of polymer chemistry. The degree of polymerisation of the polysaccharide may be increased by further polymerisation or by cross linking agents before, during, or after the derivatisation step.<br>
For both of the aforementioned methods, grafting the benefit agent onto the polysaccharide can be effected either&gt;_~-.<br>
(a)	by physical attraction between the benefit agent and the polysaccharide, especially<br>
the use of a block copolymer where one block has a physical affinity for the benefit<br>
agent and the other block can undergo a chemical change during treatment which<br>
increases its affinity for the fabric; or<br>
(b)	by grafting the benefit agent onto the polysaccharide using a bond which is<br>
relatively hydroiytically stable. For example, an ester bond can be used which is more<br>
stable than the one intended to undergo the chemical change but which is not be<br>
completely stable. For example a conjugated or aromatic ester. Such grafting can be<br>
accomplished by reacting the polysaccharide or already-pre-modified polymeric<br>
backbone (especially cellulose esters, especially cellulose acetates) with a benefit-agent<br>
reagent (especially acid halides, especially carboxylic acid halides, anhydrides,<br>
carboxylic acid anhydrides, carboxylic acids, isocyanates, triazine derivatives, amines,<br>
hydrazines) in a solvent which dissolves the polysaccharide, swells the polysaccharide,<br>
or does not swell the polysaccharide (depending on whether grafting the benefit agent<br>
first or last) but dissolves or swells the final product.<br>
17<br><br>
-<br>
For the grafting, typically, radiation methods may be used, for example:-<br>
1. Grafting by mutual irradiation ( The direct radiation grafting of the benefit group onto the polysaccharide).<br>
The mutual irradiation method is the simplest radiation-chemical method for producing graft copolymers. The procedure involves the irradiation of a polymeric substrate in the presence of a benefit group-containing monomer solution, preferably in the absence of oxygen at around ambient temperature for a giving time and irradiation dose . It is known that most radiation-initiated polymerization proceeds by free radical mechanisms, and that it is initiated by the free radicals arising from the radiolysis of the either polymer or monomer , although the mutual irradiation is the most efficient method of achieve grafting.<br>
2. Grafting on to radiation - peroxided polysaccharide.<br>
In this method , the polymeric samples of polysaccharide are first irradiated, typically in the presence of air or pure oxygen atmosphere at around ambient temperature in the absence any monomer or solvent to produce peroxide or hydroperoxides linkages by gamma irradiation. Subsequently, the graft copolymerization is initiated by the free radicals produced from the thermal decomposition of peroxide or hydroperoxides linkages under heating with a benefit agent monomer in the appropriate solvent.<br>
Two different situations arise, depending on whether peroxides or hydroperoxides are formed in the irradiated polymer. Either, the peroxidation leads to peroxidized polymer or else it leads to hydroperoxides.<br>
18-<br><br>
-<br>
Grafting may also be effected by means of chemical grafting, for example using ceric ions (A. Habeish et al, J. Appl. PoIym.Sci. 1971,15, 11 24) or using other conventional radical initiators such as potassium persulphate, e.g. per R.K. Samal, et al J. Polym. Mater. 1987,4(3), 165-172.<br>
In one example hereinbelow there is described a method of producing carboxymethyl cellulose with grafted fluorescer groups. There are a number of ways one can introduce fluorescent molecules onto carboxymethylcellulose. Generally most fluorescent molecules contain an amine functionality. A simple method will be the amidation of these two molecules. If desired a water soluble coupling agent can also be employed.<br>
Another method will be via a linking group such as cyanuric chloride (2.4,6-trichloro-1,3,5-triazine) as shown below. This can be conducted by reacting SCMC with cyanuric chloride, followed by reaction with the fluorescent molecule. The reaction sequences can also be altered, i.e. reacting the fluorescent molecule with cyanuric chloride first and then reacting the adduct with SCMC. As fluorescent molecules are sensitive to light, the reaction is best to be carried out with a blacked out apparatus.<br>

Example 1 :   Preparation of carboxymethyl cellulose with pendant fluorescer groups<br>
Carboxymethylcellulose (medium viscosity) (2g) was dissolved in water (100ml) and the pH of the solution was adjusted to 5. Then in a blacked out apparatus, cyanuric chloride (Ig) was added dropwise at 5 °C over a slow stream of nitrogen. The reaction mixture was stirred for one hour at this temperature. It was then allowed to rise to ambient temperature and then an aqueous suspension of 4-4"-bis[4-amino-6-(4-carboxyethylanilino)-s-triazine-2-yl)amino]2,2"-stilbenedisulphonic acid disodium salt (a fluorescent molecule) (0.2g) was added dropwise over 5 minutes period. After the addition was complete, the temperature was raised to 40 °C and the reaction mixture was stirred overnight at this temperature. The reaction product was transferred to a blacked out crystallising dish and freeze dried. This produced a fluorescent functionalised SCMC.<br>

Precipitating the aqueous solution into ethanol purified the polymer. The precipitate was filtered off and re-dissolved in distilled water without drying. This process was repeated three times. The purified polymer was dissolved in distilled water and the solid content determined. The level of p-nitrophenyl hydrazine was determined by UV/vis spectroscopy.<br>
