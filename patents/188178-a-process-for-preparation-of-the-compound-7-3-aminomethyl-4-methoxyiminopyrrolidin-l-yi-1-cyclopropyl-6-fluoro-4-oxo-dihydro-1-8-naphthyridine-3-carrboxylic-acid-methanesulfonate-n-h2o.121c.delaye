				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a novel process for the preparation of the compound 7-(3-aminomethyl-4-methoxyiminopyrrolidin-l-yl)-l-cyclopropyl-6-flouro-4-oxo-l,4-dihydro-l, 8-nophthyridine-3-carboxylic acid methanesulfonate. nH20, pharmaceutical and veterinary compositions comprising them, and their use in antibacterial therapy.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
EP 688772 (corresponding to the Korean Patent Laid-open Publication No 96-874) discloses novel    quinoline(napthyridine)carboxylic     acid    derivatives,     including    anhydrous     7-(3-aminomethyl-4-methoxyiminopyrrrolidin-l-yl)-l-cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-4-oxo-l,4-dihydro-l,8-naphthyridine-3-carboxylic acid of formula I, having antibacterial activity. 1 (Formula Removed)<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
According       to        the        invention        there       is       provided        7-(3-aminomethyl-4 methoxyiminopyrrilidin-l-yl)-l-cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-4-oxo-l,4-dihydro-l,8-naphthyridine-3-carboxylic acid methanesulfonate.<br>
7-(3-aminonothyl-4-methoxyiminopyrrolidin-l-y1)- l-cyclopropyl-6-flu oro-4-oxo-1,4-dihydro .8-naphthyridine-3-carboxylic acid methanesulfonate (hereinafter referred to as 'the methanesulfonate') may be obtained as an anhydrate or a hydrate i.e. methanesulfonate â€¢ nll20.<br>
Hydrates of the methanesulfonate wherein n is in the range 1 to 4 are preferred. Particular hydrates of the methanesulfonate which ma\ be mentioned are those in which n is 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3. 3.5 and 4. Particularly preferred compounds are those in which n is 1.5 or 3. with n=1.5 being most preferred.<br>
The moisture content of the methanesulfonate hydrates varies with<br>
the     hydration     number     (n)     of    the     hydrated     molecule.	The<br>
methanesulfonate has a molecular weight of 485.5 thus the calculated<br>
moisture content of hydrates where n is 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5 and 4 is<br>
3.6%, 5%, 6.9%, 8$%, 10.0%, 11.5% and 12.9% respectively. However,<br>
the actual moisture content of the methanesulfonate hydrates may differ<br>
from the calculated value depending on various factors including<br>
recrystallization    conditions   and    drying    conditions.	The    observed<br>
moisture content for the methanesulfonate hydrates where n is   1.   1.5.  2. 2.5, 3, 3.5 and 4 is shown in Table 1:<br>
Table   1.<br>
(Formula Removed)  <br>
It  is possible  to  mix  methanesulfonate  hydrates  having  different<br>
moisture contents together to give materials having intermediate moisture<br>
contents, for example, a mixture of 1  hydrate and  1.5 hydrate having a<br>
moisture content of 2 to 6%; a mixture of 1.5  hydrate and 2 hydrate<br>
having a moisture content of 4 to 8%; a mixture of 2 hydrate and 2.5<br>
hydrate having a moisture content of 6 to 9%; a mixture of 1,5 hydrate<br>
and 3 hydrate having a moisture content of 4 to 11%; a mixture of 2.5<br>
hydrate and 3 hydrate having a moisture content of 8 to 11%; a mixture<br>
of 3 hydrate and 3.5 hydrate having a moisture content of 9 to 12%; or<br>
a mixture of 3.5 hydrate and 4 hydrate having a moisture content of 11<br>
to  13%, can be obtained.<br>
Preferred   methanesulfonate   hydrates   have   a   moisture   content   of from 4  to 6% or from 9 to   11%, especially a moisture content of from<br>
4  to 6%.<br>
The   methanesulfonate   has   been   observed   to   exist   as   a   stable hydrate,over a range ol hydration numbers (n).     Stability of the hydrate<br>
refers to its resistance to loss or gain of water molecules contained in the compound. The methanesulfonate hydrates maintain a constant moisture content over an extended relative humidity range. The n=3 hydrate has a constant moisture content at a relative humidity of from at least 23 to 75% and the n=1.5 hydrate has a constant moisture content at a relative humidity of from 23 to 64% (see Figure 3 and 4). In contrast, moisture absorption by the anhydrate varies with relative humidity.<br>
Both anhydrate and n=3 hydrate undergo transition to n=1.5 hydrate in aqueous suspension indicating that the latter is thermodynamically more stable. The n=1.5 hydrate is a sesquihydrate at 11 to 64% of relative humidity. Above 75% relative humidity, it takes up water over 10% and its XRD pattern changes. The new hydrate (another form of n=3; it has different physiochemical properties from the ordinary n=3 hydrate of example 2) obtained from n=1.5 hydrate at 93% relative humidity is not stable at a lower relative humidity. It converts back to n=1.5 hydrate below 75% relative humidity.<br>
Since the moisture content of the anhydrate changes readily depending on the environment e.g. relative humidity, formulation additives etc, it may require careful handling during storage or formulation, with operations such as quantifying procedures being performed in a dry room. The hydrates do not change in moisture content as easily and hence products which are stable to prolonged storage and formulation may be obtained. The hydrate can be tabletted without the addition of a binder since the water contained in the compound itself acts a binder, whereas it may not be possible to tablet the anhydrate at a similar pressure.<br>
I he present invention also provided a process for the preparation of 7-(3-aminomethyl-4-n}ethoxyiniinopyrrolidin-l-yl)-l-cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-4-oxo-1.4-dihydro-l,8-naphthyridine-3-carboxylic acid methanesulfonate and hydrates thereof which comprises reacting 7-(3-aminometh&gt; 1-4-rnethoxyiminopyrrolidin-l-yI)-I-cyclopropyI-6-fIuoro-4-oxo-I.4-dihydro-I.8-naphthyridine-3-carboxylic acid with methanesulfonic acid and crystallizing the resulting methanesulfonate from solution, and where desired or necessary adjusting the hydration of the compound.<br>
The methanesulfonate and  its hydrates  may  be prepared  by  the<br>
addition of methanesulfonic acid to the free base which may be prepared<br>
as described in EP 688772.       Preferably, 0.95 to   1.5 molar equivalents<br>
of methanesulfonic acid is added to the free base, or 1  molar equivalent<br>
of methanesulfonic acid    dissolved in a suitable solvent is added to the<br>
free base.      Suitable solvents for the preparation of the methanesulfonate<br>
and  its  hydrates  include  any  solvent  in which  the  methanesulfonate  is<br>
substantially insoluble, suitable solvents include C1-C4 haloalkanes, C1-C8<br>
alcohols and water, or mixtures thereof.        Dichloromethane, chloroform,<br>
1,2-dichloroethane.   methanol,   ethanol,   propanol   and   water,   or   mixtures<br>
thereof,   are  preferred   solvents.        If necessary,   the   free   base   may   be<br>
heated in the solvent to facilitate solution before methanesulfonic acid is<br>
added,    alternatively    the   methanesulfonic    acid    may    be   added    to   a<br>
suspension,   or   partial   suspension,   of   the   free   base   in   the   solvent.<br>
Following  addition   of the  methanesulfonic   acid   the   reaction   mixture   is<br>
preferably   allowed    to    stand    or    is   stirred    for    1    to    24    hours    at    a<br>
temperature of from  about -10  to 40'(	The  resulting  methanesulfonate<br>
is  obtained  as  a  solid  which  can  be  isolated  by   filtration  or  by   removal of the solvent under reduced pressure.<br>
Different hydrates may be obtained by altering the recrystahzation conditions used in the preparation of the methanesulfonate such conditions may be ascertained by conventional methods known to those skilled in the art<br>
The present invention also provides a process for the preparation of a hydrate of 7-(3-ammomethyl-4-methoxyiminopyrrolidin-1-yl)-1-cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-4-oxo-1,4-dihydro-1,8-naphthyridme-3-carboxylic  acid   methanesulfonate   comprising exposing the methanesulfonate anhydrate or a solvate thereof to a high relative humidity<br>
The methanesulfonate anhydrate or a solvate thereof is preferably exposed to a relative humidity of at least 75%.<br>
The methanesulfonate anhydrate or solvate thereof may be exposed to high relative humidity by passing humidified nitrogen gas through the methanesulfonate anhydrate or solvate thereof or by standing the methanesulfonate anhydrate or solvates thereof under a high relative humidity<br>
The humidified nitrogen gas used in this process, for example nitrogen gas having a humidity of at least 75% may be made by conventional methods In this process it is desirable to maintain the temperature in the range above which moisture   condensation   could   occur    Also,   particularly   in   the   large   scale<br><br>
The methanesulfonate and its hydrates exhibit the same potent<br>
antibacterial activity as the corresponding free base disclosed in HP<br>
688772. The methanesulfonate and its hydrates also exhibit desirable<br>
physicochemical properties including improved solubility and constant<br>
moisture content regardless of the ambient relative humidity when<br>
compared    to    the     free    base    and    other    salts    thereof.	The<br>
methanesulfonate  and  its hydrates  thus exhibit greater ease  of handling, quality control and formulation than the free base and other salts thereof.<br>
As mentioned above the methanesulfonate and its hydrates exhibit<br>
antibacterial activity. The methanesulfonate and its hydrates may be<br>
formulated for adminstration in any convenient way for use in human or<br>
veterinary medicine, according to techniques and procedures per se<br>
known in the art with reference to other antibiotics, and the invention<br>
therefore includes within its scope a pharmaceutical composition<br>
comprising 7-(3-aminomethy 1-4-methoxyiminopyrrolidin-1 -yl)-1 -cyclopropy1-<br>
6-fluoro-4-oxo-l,4-dihydro-l,8-naph-thyridine-3-carboxylic acid methane<br>
sulfonate and hydrates thereof together with a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
carrier   or   excipient.	The    compositions   may    be    formulated    for<br>
administration by any suitable route, such as oral, parenteral or topical application. The compositions may be in the form of tablets, capsules, powders, granules, lozenges, creams or liquid preparations, such as oral or sterile parenteral solutions or suspensions. Tablets and capsules for oral administration may be in unit dose presentation form and may contain conventional excipicnls such as binding agents, for example, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, hydroxy propyl cellulose, syrup acacia, gelatin, sorbitol, tragacanth, or polyvinylpyrrolidone; fillers, for example microcrystalline cellulose,  lactose, sugar, maize-starch, calcium phosphate.<br>
sorbitol  or glycine:  tabletting  lubricants,  for example magnesium  stearate talc,   polyethylene   glycol   or   silica:   disintegrants,    for   example   sodium starch   giycolate,  cross   linked  polyvinyl  pyrrolidone  or   potato  starch:  or acceptable  wetting  agents  such  as  sodium  lauryl  sulfate.        The  tablets may     be    coated    according    to    methods    well     known     in    normal pharmaceutical  practice.       Oral   liquid preparations  may   be  in  the  form of. for example, aqueous or oily suspensions, solutions, emulsions, syrups or elixirs, or may be presented as a dry product for reconstitution with water  or  other  suitable  vehicle  before  use.        Such   liquid  preparations may   contain   conventional   additives   such   as   suspending   agents,   for example   sorbitol,  methyl   cellulose,   glucose  syrup,   gelatin,   hydroxyethyl cellulose, caboxymethyl cellulose, aluminum stearate gel or hydrogenated edible fats; emulsifying agents, for example lecithin, sorbitan monooleate, or   acacia;   non-aqueous   vehicles   (which   may   include   edible   oils),   for example  almond  oil,  oily  esters,  glycerine,  propylene  glycol,  or  ethyl alcohol; preservatives,  for example  methyl  or propyl p-hydroxybenzoate or sorbic acid; and, if desired conventional flavouring or coloring agents. Suppositories     will     contain     conventional     suppository     base,     e.g. cocoa-butter or other glyceride.<br>
For parenteral administration, fluid unit dosage forms are prepared<br>
utilizing the compound and a sterile vehicle, water being preferred<br>
The methanesulfonate or hydrate thereof, can be either suspended or<br>
dissolved in the vehicle, depending on the vehicle and concentration<br>
used. In preparing solutions the methanesulfonate or hydrate thereof<br>
can be dissolved in water for injection and filter sterilized before filling<br>
into   a   suitable   vial   or   ampoule   and   sealing.	Advantageously,   agents<br>
such as local anaesthetic, preservative and buffering agents can be dissolved in the vehicle. To enhanced the stability, the composition can be   lyophilised   and   the   dry   lyophilised   powder   sealed   in   a   vial,   an<br>
accompanying vial of water for injection supplied to reconstitute the powder prior to use. Parental suspensions are prepared in substantially the same manner except that the methanesulfonate or hydrate thereof can be sterilized by exposure to ethylene oxide before suspension in the sterile vehicle. Advantageously, a surfactant or wetting agent is included in the composition to facilitate uniform distribution of the methanesulfonate or hydrate thereof. The methanesulfonate or hydrate thereof may also be formulated as a intramammary composition for veterinary use.<br>
The composition may contain from 0.1% to 100% by weight, preferably from 10 to 99.95% by weight, more preferably from 50 to 99.5% weight of the active ingredient measured as the free base depending on the method of administration. Where the compositions comprise dosage units, each unit will preferably contain from 50-1500 mg of the methanesulfonate or hydrate thereof as active ingredient. The dosage as employed for adult human treatment will preferably range from 100 mg to 12 g per day, depending on the route and frequency of administration. Such dosages correspond to approximately 1.5 to 170 mg/kg per day. Suitably the dosage is from 1 to 6 g per day.<br>
The daily dosage is suitably given by administering the methanesulfonate or hydrate thereof once or several times in a 24-hour period, e g. up to 400 mg maybe administered once a day, in practice, the dosage and frequency of administration which will be most suitable for an individual will vary with the age, weight and response of the patients, and there will be occasions when the physician will choose a higher or lower dosage and different frequency of administration. Such dosage regimens are within the scope of this invention.<br>
The present invention also includes a method of treating bacterial infections in humans and animals which method comprises administering a therapeutically effective amount of 7-(3-aminomethyl-4-methoxyiminopyrrilidin-l-yl)-l-cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-4-oxo-l,4-dihydro-l,8-naphthyridine-3-carboxylic acid methanesulfonate or hydrate thereof.<br>
In  further  aspect,   the  present  invention  also  provides  the  use  of 7-(3-aminomethyl-4-methoxyiminopyrrilidin-l-yl)-l-cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-4-oxo-l,4-dihydro-l,8-naphthyridine-3-carboxylic acid methanesulfonate or hydrate thereof for the manufacture of a medicament for treating bacterial infection.<br>
The methanesulfonate and its hydrates are active against a broad range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and may be used to treat a wide range of bacterial infections including those in immunocompromised patients.<br>
Amongst many other uses, the methanesulfonate and its hydrates are of value in the treatment of skin, soft tissue, respiratory tract and urinary tract infections and sexually transmitted diseases in humans. The methanesulfonate and its hydrates may also be used in the treatment of bacterial infections in animals, such as mastitis in cattle.<br>
In accordance with the present invention there is disclosed a novel process for preparation of<br>
the compound 7-(3-aminomethyl-4-methoxyiminopyrrolidin-l-yl)-cyclopropyl-6-flouro-4-oxo-<br>
1,4-dihydro-l, 8-naphthyridine-3-carboxylic acid methanesulfonate. NH2O wherein n is in the<br>
range of from 1 to 4, which comprises reacting 7-(3-aminomethyl-4-methoxyiminopyrrolidin-l-<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The solvate has a different crystal structure from the anhydrate or<br>
from the compound in which organic solvent molecules are remained<br>
without any influence on the crystal structure, and thus should be<br>
distinguished   from   them.	The   different   crystal   structure   may   result<br>
different physicochemical properties such as cryslallinity, hygroseopicity, melting point, solubility, solubilizing rate, etc. Usually the residual solvent  is  removed  by  drying under reduced  pressure  in  the  final  step.<br><br>
However,   when   the   pharmaceutically   active  compound   is  present   as   a<br>
solvate with a specific solvent, that is the solvent molecule is located in<br>
the   crystalline   structure   of the   compound,   the   solvent   molecules   may<br>
hardly be removed by drying under reduced pressure.       In some cases,<br>
the  solvents are not removed until the temperature reaches the melting<br>
point of the solvate, and therefore such an elimination process cannot be<br>
applied   to   industrial   process.	Since   only   the   medicinal   materials<br>
containing the solvent  in  an  amount  of less  than  the  permitted  limit<br>
specifically defined for the solvent are valuable, appropriate methods for<br>
removing solvent from each solvates  should be established through the<br>
study about characteristics of each solvates.<br>
The present inventors have made several experiments in order to identify the moisture content and physicochemical property of the methanesulfonate anhydrate and each hydrate, and the results are described in connection with the drawings in the following.<br>

4-dihydro-I,8-naphthyridine-3-carboxylic   acid   methanesulfonate   anhydrate<br>
at   several   relative   humidities.	Over   the   whole   range   of  relative<br>
humidity  tested, the initial moisture sorption proceeds very  speedily  at<br>
each  relative  humidity.        In  most  cases   the   equilibrium   is   achieved<br>
within 2 hours.     Figure 2 shows the isothermal moisture sorption profile<br>
of the  methanesulfonate  anhydrate   according   to   the   change   in   relative<br>
humidity at 25 "C.       The weight increment (%) of Y-axis represents the<br>
equilibrium moisture  content,   from  which   it  can   be  recognized   that  the<br>
equilibrium moisture content depends on  the  relative humidity.       Figure<br>
3  shows the equilibrium moisture content of the n=3 hydrate (which  is<br>
obtained by recrystallization from a solvent mixture of ethanol and water)<br><br>
after it is allowed to stand for 2 weeks under relative humidities in the range of 23 to 75%. The result shows that the n=3 hydrate is still more stable than the anhydrate because the hydrate maintains a moisture content of around 10% under the relative humidities tested. Figure 4 shows the isothermal moisture sorption profile of the n=1.5 hydrate. Here, it maintains a moisture content of around 5% under the relative humidity in the range of 23 to 64%. Thus, it is also identified as a stable hydrate.<br>
On   the   other   hand,   it   has   been   identified   that   the   physical property of the hydrate is very different from that of the anhydrate.<br>
For example, by comparing the powder X-ray diffraction pattern of the anhydrate in Figure 5, that of the 3 hydrate in Figure 6, and that of the  1.5 hydrate in Figure 7, it can be seen that their crystal  forms are different from each other.        In addition, the thermal analysis using Differential   Scanning   Calorimetry   shows   that   the   endothermic  peak produced by the vaporization of the water molecules contained in the 3 hydrate   begins   at   around   50  oC  and   the   exothermic  peak   by   thermal decomposition    is   observed   at   around    185    to   220oC,    whereas   the anhydrate shows only an exothermic peak at around 185 to 220oC due to the thermal decomposition without any endothermic peak(see, Figure 9). At   the   same   time,   the   thermogravimetric   analysis   shows   a   weight decrement  at  the  temperature  range oCendothermic  peak,  the  extent  of which   corresponds   to   the   moisture   content   quantified   by   Karl-Fisher mcthod(Mettler  Toledo DL37K.F Coulometer)(see. Figure  10).      Therefore, il   is  verified  thai  the  endothermic   peak  shown   in  the   DSC  analysis  is due to the evaporation of a water molecule.<br>
The present  inventors also compared  the chemical  stability  under<br><br>
heating of the hydrate with that of the anhydrate in order to identify whether or not the hydration exerts any influence on the chemical stability of the anhydrate. In this test, the anhydrate and hydrate each are kept at 70 oC for 4 weeks, and the extent of decomposition is analyzed by liquid chromatography. There resulted no difference in decomposition between the hydrate and the anhydrate, and thus it is identified that the hydrate has the same extent of chemical stability with the anhydrate.<br>
The   methanesulfonate   thus   obtained   or   its   solvate   may    be<br>
converted into a hydrate under appropriate conditions.	This process<br>
can be monitored by die change of X-ray diffraction pattern and the decrement of the amount of organic solvent in the compound. Such changes have been caused by the water molecules newly intercalated into the crystal structure.<br>
As can be seen from Figure 11, the X-ray diffraction peaks based<br>
on the solvate disappear with the passing of humidified nitrogen gas to<br>
leave the peaks based on the hydrate. This means all the solvates are<br>
converted  into  hydrates.	The  residual  solvent   is  decreased  to  the<br>
amount of less than the quantitative limit simultaneously with the change<br>
of X-ray diffraction. Figure 12 shows that the X-ray diffraction peaks<br>
based on the solvate disappear when the solvate is allowed to stand<br>
under  93%  relative  humidity.	However,  there   is  no  change  in  the<br>
X-ray diffraction pattern when the solvate is allowed to stand under<br>
relative   humidity   of   11%   or   52%(see  Figure   13).	Therefore,   it   is<br>
recognized that the change as Figure i2 occurs not by the spontaneous evaporation of the residual solvent but by the substitution of the organic solvents in the crystal by water moleuntes<br>
In preparing the hydrate according to the processes as explained above, the respective hydrates having a different hydration number can be obtained by changing conditions such as humidity, time, temperature, etc. or changing the recrystallization condition. Such conditions should be controlled differently upon considering whether the starting material is anhydrate or solvate, and what is the kind of the solvate.<br>
The present invention will be more specifically explained by the following examples and experimental examples. However, it should be understood that the examples are intended to illustrate but not to in any manner limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
Example 1: Synthesis of 7-(3-aminomethyl-4-methoxyiminopyrrol-idin-1 -y 1)-1 -cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-4-oxo-1,4-dihydro-1,8-naphthyridine-3-carbo xylic acid methanesulfonate anhydrate<br>
7-(3 - Aminomethyl-4-methyloxyiminopyrrolidin-1-y1)-1-cyclopropy1-6-<br>
fluoro-4-oxc-l,4-dihydro-l,8-naphthyridine-3-carboxylic acid (3.89g, 10<br>
mmol) was suspended in a mixture of dichloromethane and ethanol (110<br>
mâ„“,   8:2   v/v).	Methanesulfonic   acid   (0.94g,   9.8mmol)   was   added<br>
dropwise and the resulting solution was stirred for 1 hour at 0Â°C. The resulting solid was filtered, washed with ethanoi then dried to give the title compound (4.55g).<br>

Example 2: Synthesis of 7-(3-aminomethyl-4-methoxyiminopyrrol-idin-1 -yl)- l-cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-4-oxo-1.4-dihydro-1,8-naphthyridine-3-carbo xylic acid methanesulfonate n=3 hydrate<br>
A sonicator filled with water was adjusted to 40*0, sealed with a<br>
lid  and  a  nitrogen  inlet  and outlet  connected.        When the pressure  of<br>
the   dried  nitrogen   introduced  through  the   inlet  was  20psi  the  relative<br>
humidity  of the nitrogen exiting through the outlet was more than 93%.<br>
The anhydrate of Example 1 having a moisture content of 2.5% (l.Og)<br>
was introduced into a fritted filter and the humidified nitrogen produced<br>
as described above passed through the filter.        Samples were taken after<br>
0,  5,   10,  20,  30,  and  60 minutes and the moisture content measured.<br>
From  the  results  shown  in  Figure   8   it   can   be  seen  that  a  moisture<br>
content of about  10% is maintained when the humidifying procedure is<br>
carried out over about 30 minutes.      The X-ray diffraction pattern of the<br>
humidified sample was identical to that of the n=3 hydrate obtained by<br>
recrystallization.	<br>

The title compound can be prepared by two routes:<br>
Route A<br>
The anhydrate of Example 1 (l.0g) was dissolved in a mixture of water and acetone (17mâ„“. '0:7 w) The solvent was slowly evaporated in darkness leaving the title compound as a solid (0.8g).<br>
Route B<br>
The anhydrate of Example 1 (5.0g) was added to water (10mâ„“) and the mixture was heated to 45 Â°C to aid dissolution. Ethanol(20mâ„“) was added and the resulting solution stirred then allowed to stand. The resulting solid was filtered and dried under a flow of nitrogen to give the title compound (2.6g).<br>

A sonicator filled with water was adjusted to 40 oC, sealed with a<br>
lid and a nitrogen inlet and outlet connected. When the pressure of<br>
the dried nitrogen introduced through the inlet was 20psi the relative<br>
humidity of the nitrogen exiting through the outlet was more than 93%.<br>
The solvate(lg, ethanol 0.11%) of the anhydrate of Example 1 was<br>
introduced into a fritted filter and the humidified nitrogen gas prepared<br>
as   Example  2   was   passed   through	Samples   were   taken   after  40<br>
minutes, 3.5 and 6 hours, respectively. Then, the change in the amount of the residual organic solvent and X-ray diffraction pattern with the lapse of time were examined. After 3.5 hours, it was identified that the product contains the organic solvent in an amount of less than 50ppm and that the peaks based on the solvate disappear, while the peaks based on the mixture of 3 hydrate and 1 5 hydrate are newly come out.<br>
Example 5: Synthesis of the hvdrate from the 7-(3-aminomethyl-4-methy loxy iminopyrrolidin-1 -yl)-1 -cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-4-oxo-1.4-dihydro-1.8 -naphthyridine-3-carboxylic   acid   methanesulfonate   solvate(using   a   high relative humidity)<br>
Saturated aqueous potassium nitrate solution was placed in a<br>
desiccator, and accordingly the relative humidity inside the desiccator was<br>
controlled to 93%. For tests under relative humidity of 11% or 52%,<br>
desiccators containing saturated aqueous solutions of lithium chloride and<br>
magnesium  nitrate,   respectively,   were  prepared.	Into   the   desiccator<br>
having a relative humidity of 93% was introduced a solvate containing<br>
1.9% of ethanol, and into each of the desiccators having a relative<br>
humidity of 93%, 52% or 11% was introduced a solvate containing<br>
0.12% of ethanol. The solvates therein were stored not to contact the<br>
salt  solutions  aforementioned.	After  a  certain  period  of time  has<br>
passed, samples were taken and subjected to gas chromatography in order<br>
to analyze the residual solvent As a result, it was identified that both<br>
solvates which have been stored for 4 weeks under 93% relative<br>
humidity contain the organic solvent in an amount of less than 50ppm.<br>
Also, it was identified by X-ray diffraction pattern that peaks based on<br>
the solvates disappear after 4 weeks.	To the contrary,  in case the<br>
samples are stored under relative humidity of 52% or 11 %, the amount of residual organic solvent and X-ray diffraction pattern after 4 weeks are identical with those at the beginning.<br>
Example    6:     Synthesis    of    n-3    hydrates    from    the    various 7-(3-aminomethyl-4-methoxyiminopyrrolidin-l-yl)-l-cyclopropyl-6-fluroro-4-oxo-1,4-dihydro- l,8-naphthyridine-3-carboxylic        acid        methanesulfonate solvates<br>
Dried nitrogen gas and humidified nitrogen gas having a relative humidity of 78 to 84% were passed over 24 hours, respectively, through l0g of four different solvates each of which has a different kind and amount of organic solvent from the others. Then, the amount of the residual organic solvent among the sample was measured and the change in X-ray diffraction pattern was analyzed, the results of which are shown in the following Table 2. The X-ray diffraction analysis shows that the samples through which dried nitrogen gas has been passed remains as the original solvates, while the samples through which humidified nitrogen gas has been passed have the same X-ray diffraction pattern and crystallinity to those of the n=3 hydrate obtained by recrystallization.<br>
The different results from both experiments suggest that water molecules contained in the humidified nitrogen gas replace the organic solvents in the solvate. And this suggestion can also be supported by the change in X-ray diffraction pattern influenced by a relative humidity.<br>

Example7. Synthesis of the ethanolate containing ethanol 0.11%. The anhydrate of Example 1(5.0g) was added to a solvent mixture of ethanol (25ml)and water (25ml) and the mixture was heated to 50Â°C to facilitate dissolution. Then the solution was cooled slowly to -3Â°C and allowed to stand at that temperature for about 3 hours. The resulting solid was filtered and washed with a solvent mixture of ethanol and water (16.5ml, ethanol: water=20:8,v/v) to give the title compound quantitatively.<br>
Test Example  1: Moisture sorption of the anhvdrate of Example 1<br>
The   moisture    sorption    velocity    and    the    equilibrium    moisture<br>
content of die anhydrate of Example  1  was determined by means of an<br>
automatic  moisture   sorption   analyzer   (MB   300G   Gravimetric   Sorption<br>
Analyzer).       This instrument produces a specific relative humidity at a<br>
specific  temperature  and  continuously  records  the  weight  change  of a<br>
sample   due   to  sorption   or  desorption  of moisture  as   measured   by   a<br>
micro balance inside the instrument.       The anhydrate of Example  1  (16<br>
mg) was loaded onto the micro balance and the moisture contained in the<br>
sample removed under a stream of dried nitrogen    at 50 Â°C       A weight<br>
change of less than 5Âµg per 5 minutes was the criterion for complete<br>
dryness.       Thereafter,  the inner temperature was adjusted to 25 Â°C   and<br>
the sample tested at 5% intervals whilst varying the humidity from 0 to<br>
95%.       The sample was considered to have reached equilibrium when<br>
the weight change was less than 5Âµg per 5 minutes.      Figure  1  shows<br>
die moisture sorption velocity, that is the time required for the sample to<br>
reach equilibrium  at  each relative humidity.       As can  be seen  initial<br>
moisture sorption proceeded rapidly at each relative humidity tested, in<br>
most cases equilibrium was reached within 2 hours.       Figure 2 shows<br>
the   weight   increment   at   each   relative   humidity,   i.e.   the   equilibrium<br>
moisture   content.	It   is   clear   from   Figure   2   that   the   equilibrium<br>
moisture content of the anhydrate is dependent on the relative humidity.<br>
Test Example 2: Thermal analysis of the anhydrate of Example  1 and n=3 hydrate prepared in Example 2<br>
For  the   Differential   Scanning   Calori'metry,   METTLER   TOLEDO<br>
DSC821e and METTLER  TOLEDO STARe System  were  used.	The<br>
sample   (3.7mg)   was   weighed   into   the   aluminum   pan   which   was   then<br>
press sealed with an aluminum lid. Three tiny needle holes were made on the lid and the sample was tested by heating from normal temperature to 250 Â°C at a rate of 10Â°C/min. As can be seen from Figure 9, the endothermic peak due to the vaporization of the water molecules contained in the n=3 hydrate begins at around 50 oC and the exothermic peak due to the thermal decomposition is observed at around 180 to 220 oC. In contrast, the anhydrate showed only an exothermic peak due to the thermal decomposition at around 185 to 220oC without any endothermic peak.<br>
In the thermogravimetric analysis, SEIKO TG/DTA220 was used.<br>
The sample (3.8mg) was weighed into an aluminum pan and was heated<br>
from normal temperature to 250oC at a rate of l0 oC/min according to<br>
the temperature raising program.	As can be seen from Figure  10,<br>
weight decrement was observed at the temperature range of endothermic peak, the extent of which corresponds to the moisture content determined by Karl-Fisher method (Mettler Toledo DL37KF Coulometer).<br>
Test Example 3: Equilibrium moisture content determination of hydrates<br>
Six saturated aqueous salt solutions were introduced into each desiccator to control the inner relative humidity to a specific value as shown in Table 3. Then, equilibrium moisture contents of n=3 hydrate and n=1.5 hydrate of Examples 2 and 3, respectively, were determined at several relative humidities.<br>
Table 3. Saturated salt solutions inside the desiccator<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The sample (l00mg) was spread on a pre-weighed Petri dish and<br>
the total weight was accurately measured, then three of me sample were<br>
placed in each desiccator of Table 3.       The desiccators were allowed to<br>
stand at normal temperature for 7 days and then the sample was taken<br>
to be weighed.    After 13 days one of the three samples inside each<br>
desiccator was taken and the moisture content of each was measured by<br>
the thermogravimetric analysis described in Test Example 2.   Equilibrium<br>
moisture  content  at  each  relative  humidity  is  represented   in  Figure  3<br>
(n=3   hydrate)  and   Figure  4  (n=1.5   hydrate).        Figure  3   shows   that<br>
moisture content of the n=3 hydrate is maintained around   10% for the<br>
whole relative humidity range tested;    Figure 4 shows that the moisture<br>
content  of the  n=1.5   hydrate  is  maintained  around  5%  at  the  relative<br>
humidity of 23 to 64%.	Both hydrates are stable since they keep a<br>
constant  equilibrium  moisture content   regardless  of  the  relative  humidity change.<br><br>
Text Example 4: X-ray Diffraction analysis<br>
The anhydrate of Example 1,n=3 hydrate of Example 2 and n=1.5 hydrate of<br>
Example (50mg of each ) were thinly spread on the sample holder, X-ray<br>
diffraction  analysis  (35kV x 20mA  Rigaku   Gergeflex     D/max-lll   C  )were<br>
performed under the conditions listed below.<br>

Results of X-ray diffraction analyses on the anhydrate, n=3 hydrate, and the n=1.5 hydrate are shown in Figure 5,6 and 7. The diffraction patterns illustrate the difference in crystal form of these 3 compounds.<br>
According to a further aspect of the invention we provide 7-(3-aminomethyf-4 -methoxyiminopyrrolidin-1-yl)-1-cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-4-oxo-1,4-dihydro-1,8-naphthyridine-3-carboxylic acid methanesulfonate having an X-ray diffraction pattern substantially as shown in Figure 5,6 or 7.<br>

The change of crystallinity during the conversion from the solvate to the hydrate in Examples 4 and 5 was identified by X-ray diffraction analysis under the same conditions as mentioned above (see, Figure 11 to 13). Figure 11 shows the X-ray Diffraction pattern of the solvate is changed into that of the 3 hydrate (see, Example 4);Figure 12 represents the change in X-ray diffraction pattern of the solvate containing 1.9% of _<br>
ethanol before and after storage of one week, two weeks, three weeks and four weeks at 93% of relative humidity; and Figure 13 represents the change in X-ray diffraction pattern of the solvate containing 0.12% of ethanol after storage of four weeks at 93%, 52% and 11% of relative humidity, respectively(see, Example 5).<br>
Test Example 5: Chemical stability<br>
The chemical stability of the n=3 hydrate of Example 2 and the n=1.5 hydrate of Example 3 and the anhydrate of Example 1 was compared at elevated temperature in order to determine the effect on chemical stability of the extent of hydration.<br>
The anhydrate and each of the hydrates were introduced into a glass vial and maintained at 70 "C. The extent of decomposition with elapsed time was analyzed by liquid chromatography. The results obtained are shown in Table 4.<br>

As can be seen from Table 4, the n=3 hydrate and the n=1.5 hydrate both show the same degree of chemical stability as the anhydrate.<br>

The results are shown in Tables 5. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC, Âµg/mâ„“) was simply calculated simply in the ratio of weight without considering the molecular weight, and ciprofloxacin was chosen as the control.<br>
