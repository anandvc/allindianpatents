or branched as far as this is possible - including in combination with heteroatoms, such as, for<br>
example, in alkoxy.<br>
Optionally substituted radicals may be mono- or polysubstituted, where in the case of<br>
polysubstitution the substituents may be identical or different.<br>
However, the general or preferred radical definitions or illustrations given above can also be<br>
combined with one another as desired, i.e. between the respective ranges and preferred ranges. They<br>
apply to the end products and, correspondingly, to the precursors and intermediates.<br>
The preparation of the optically active phthalamides of the formula (I) according to the invention is<br>
depicted in Scheme 1. Reaction conditions for the single reaction steps are identical to the reactions<br>
described in EP-A 0 919 542 and EP-A 1 006 107 (cf. also the preparation examples below).<br>
Compounds of the formula (I) may be obtained furthermore by synthesis of the racemic analogues<br>
which racemates are subsequently resolved by customary methods, such as, for example, by<br>
chromatography of the corresponding racemates on a chiral stationary phase. In this manner, it is<br>
possible to resolve both the racemic end products or racemic intermediates into the two enantiomers.<br>
Compounds of the formula (II) (cf. Scheme 1)<br>
The compounds of formula (HI) may be obtained according to processes described in EP-A 1 418 169<br>
and EP-A 1418 163.<br>
Compounds of formula (IV) are either commercially available or can be prepared according to<br>
JP 2001335571.<br>
Compounds of formula (V) can be obtained by the process described in US 6,639,109.<br>
The active compounds are suitable for protecting plants and plant organs, for increasing the harvest<br>
yields, for improving the quality of the harvested material and for controlling animal pests, in<br>
particular insects, arachnids and nematodes, which are encountered in agriculture, in forests, in<br>
gardens and leisure facilities, in the protection of stored products and of materials, and in the hygiene<br>
sector, and have good plant tolerance and favourable toxicity to warm-blooded animals and are<br>
tolerated well by the environment. They may be preferably employed as plant protection agents. They<br>

The compounds of the formula (I) according to the invention have in particular excellent activity<br>
against caterpillars and beetle larvae.<br>
If appropriate, the compounds according to the invention can, at certain concentrations or application<br>
rates, also be used as herbicides or microbicides, for example as fungicides, antimycotics and<br>
bactericides. If appropriate, they can also be employed as intermediates or precursors for the synthesis<br>
of other active compounds.<br>
All plants and plant parts can be treated in accordance with the invention. Plants are to be understood<br>
as meaning in the present context all plants and plant populations such as desired and undesired wild<br>
plants or crop plants (including naturally occurring crop plants). Crop plants can be plants which can<br>
be obtained by conventional plant breeding and optimization methods or by biotechnological and<br>
genetic engineering methods or by combinations of these methods, including the transgenic plants<br>
and including the plant cultivars protectable or not protectable by plant breeders' rights. Plant parts<br>
are to be understood as meaning all parts and organs of plants above and below the ground, such as<br>
shoot, leaf, flower and root, examples which may be mentioned being leaves, needles, stalks, stems,<br>
flowers, fruit bodies, fruits, seeds, roots, tubers and rhizomes. The plant parts also include harvested<br>
material, and vegetative and generative propagation material, for example cuttings, tubers, rhizomes,<br>
offshoots and seeds.<br>
Treatment according to the invention of the plants and plant parts with the active compounds is<br>
carried out directly or by allowing the compounds to act on the surroundings, environment or storage<br>
space by the customary treatment methods, for example by immersion, spraying, evaporation,<br>
fogging, scattering, painting on and, in the case of propagation material, in particular in the case of<br>
seeds, also by applying one or more coats.<br>
The active compounds can be converted to the customary formulations, such as solutions, emulsions,<br>
wettable powders, suspensions, powders, dusts, pastes, soluble powders, granules, suspensionemulsion<br>
concentrates, natural and synthetic materials impregnated with active compound and<br>
microencapsulations in polymeric substances.<br>
These formulations are produced in a known manner, for example by mixing the active compounds<br>
with extenders, that is liquid solvents, and/or solid carriers, optionally with the use of surfactants, that<br>
is emulsifiers and/or dispersants, and/or foam-formers.<br>
If the extender used is water, it is also possible to employ for example organic solvents as auxiliary<br>
solvents. Essentially, suitable liquid solvents are; aromatics such as xylene, toluene or alkylnaphthalenes,<br>
chlorinated aromatics or chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons such as chlorobenzenes, chloroethylenes<br>
or methylene chloride, aliphatic hydrocarbons such as cyclohexane or paraffins, for<br>
example petroleum fractions, mineral and vegetable oils, alcohols such as butane! or glycol and also<br>
their ethers and esters, ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone or cyclohexanone,<br>
strongly polar solvents such as dimethylformamide and dimethyl sulphoxide, and also<br>
water.<br>
As solid carriers there are suitable:<br>
for example ammonium salts and ground natural minerals such as kaolins, clays, talc, chalk, quartz,<br>
attapulgfte, montmorillonite or diatomaceous earth, and ground synthetic minerals, such as highly<br>
disperse silica, alumina and silicates; as solid carriers for granules there are suitable: for example<br>
crushed and fractionated natural rocks such as calcite, marble, pumice, sepiolite and dolomite, and also<br>
synthetic granules of inorganic and organic meals, and granules of organic material such as sawdust,<br>
coconut shells, maize cobs and tobacco stalks; as emulsifiers and/or foam-formers there are suitable:<br>

98/25923), and preparations comprising insecticidal active plant extracts, nematodes, fungi or viruses.<br>
A mixture with other known active compounds, such as herbicides, fertilizers, growth regulators,<br>
safeners and/or semiochemicals is also possible.<br>
When used as insecticides, the active compounds according to the invention can furthermore be<br>
present in their commercially available formulations and in the use forms, prepared from these<br>
formulations, as a mixture with synergistic agents. Synergistic agents are compounds, which increase<br>
the action of the active compounds, without it being necessary for the synergistic agent added to be<br>
active itself.<br>
When used as insecticides, the active compounds according to the invention can furthermore be<br>
present in their commercially available formulations and in the use forms, prepared from these<br>
formulations, as a mixture with inhibitors which reduce degradation of the active compound after use<br>
in the vicinity of the plant, on the surface of parts of plants or in plant tissues.<br>
The active compound content of the use forms prepared from the commercially available formulations<br>
can vary within wide limits. The active compound concentration of the use forms can be from<br>
0.0000001 to 95% by weight of active compound, preferably between 0.0001 and 1% by weight.<br>
The compounds are employed in a customary manner appropriate for the use forms.<br>
When used against hygiene pests and pests of stored products, the active compound is distinguished<br>
by an excellent residual action on wood and clay as well as a good stability to alkali on limed<br>
substrates.<br>
As already mentioned above, it is possible to treat all plants and their parts according to the invention. In<br>
a preferred embodiment, wild plant species and plant cultivars, or those obtained by conventional<br>
biological breeding methods, such as crossing or protoplast fusion, and parts thereof, are treated. In a<br>
further preferred embodiment, transgenic plants and plant cultivars obtained by genetic engineering, if<br>
appropriate in combination with conventional methods (Genetically Modified Organisms), and parts<br>
thereof are treated. The term "parts" or "parts of plants" or "plant parts" has been explained above.<br>
Particularly preferably, plants of the plant cultivars which are in each case commercially available or<br>
in use are treated according to the invention. Plant cultivars are to be understood as meaning plants<br>
having certain properties ("traits") which have been obtained by conventional breeding, by<br>
mutagenesis or by recombinant DNA techniques. These can be cultivars, bio- or genotypes.<br>
Depending on the plant species or plant cultivars, their location and growth conditions (soils, climate,<br>
vegetation period, diet), the treatment according to the invention may also result in superaddiiive<br>
("synergistic") effects. Thus, for example, reduced application rates and/or a widening of the activity<br>
spectrum and/or an increase in the activity of the substances and compositions to be used according to<br>
the invention, better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased<br>
tolerance to drought or to water or soil salt content, increased flowering performance, easier<br>
harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvest yields, better quality and/or a higher nutritional<br>
value of the harvested products, better storage stability and/or processability of the harvested products<br>
are possible which exceed the effects which were actually to be expected.<br>
The transgenic plants or plant cultivars (i.e. those obtained by genetic engineering) which are preferably<br>
to be treated according to the invention include all plants which, in the genetic modification, received<br>
genetic material which imparted particularly advantageous useful traits to these plants. Examples of<br>
such traits are better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased tolerance<br>
to drought or to water or soil salt content, increased flowering performance, easier harvesting,<br>
accelerated maturation, higher harvest yields, better quality and/or a higher nutritional value of the<br>
harvested products, better storage stability and/or processabiliry of the harvested products. Further and<br>
particularly emphasized examples of such traits are a better defence of the plants against animal and<br>
microbial pests, such as against insects, mites, phytopathogenic fungi, bacteria and/or viruses, and also<br>
increased tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidally active compounds. Examples of transgenic<br>
plants which may be mentioned are the important crop plants, such as cereals (wheat, rice), maize, soya<br>
beans, potatoes, cotton, tobacco, oilseed rape and also fruit plants (with the fruits apples, pears, citrus<br>
fruits and grapes), and particular emphasis is given to maize, soya beans, potatoes, cotton, tobacco and<br>
oilseed rape. Traits that are emphasized are in particular increased defence of the plants against insects,<br>
arachnids, nematodes and worms by toxins formed in the plants, in particular those formed in the plants<br>
by the genetic material from Bacillus thuringiensis (for example by the genes CryIA(a), CryIA(b),<br>
CryIA(c), CryllA, CrymA, CryIHB2, Cry9c, Cry2Ab, Cry3Bb and CryBF and also combinations<br>
thereof) (hereinbelow referred to as "Bt plants"). Traits that are also particularly emphasized are the<br>
increased defence of the plants against fungi, bacteria and viruses by systemic acquired resistance<br>
(SAR), systemin, phytoalexius, elicitors and resistance genes and correspondingly expressed proteins<br>
and toxins. Traits that are furthermore particularly emphasized are the increased tolerance of the plants<br>
to certain herbicidally active compounds, for example imidazolinones, sulphonylureas, glyphosate or<br>
phosphinotricin (for example the "PAT" gene). The genes which impart the desired traits in question<br>
can also be present in combination with one another in the transgenic plants. Examples of "Bt plants"<br>
which may be mentioned are maize varieties, cotton varieties, soya bean varieties and potato varieties<br>
which are sold under the trade names YIELD GARD® (for example maize, cotton, soya beans),<br>
KnockOut® (for example maize), StarLink® (for example maize), Bollgard® (cotton), Nucotn®<br>
(cotton) and NewLeaf® (potato). Examples of herbicide-tolerant plants which may be mentioned are<br>
maize varieties, cotton varieties and soya bean varieties which are sold under the trade names Roundup<br>
Ready® (tolerance to glyphosate, for example maize, cotton, soya bean), Liberty Link® (tolerance to<br>
phosphinotricin, for example oilseed rape), BVU® (tolerance to imidazolinones) and STS® (tolerance to<br>
sulphonylureas, for example maize). Herbicide-resistant plants (plants bred in a conventional manner<br>
for herbicide tolerance) which may be mentioned include the varieties sold under the name Clearfield®<br>
(for example maize). Of course, these statements also apply to plant cultivars having these genetic traits<br>
or genetic traits still to be developed, which plants will be developed and/or marketed in the future.<br>
The plants listed can be treated according to the invention in a particularly advantageous manner with<br>
the compounds of the general formula I and/or the active compound mixtures according to the<br>
invention. The preferred ranges stated above for the active compounds or mixtures also apply to the<br>
treatment of these plants. Particular emphasis is given to the treatment of plants with the compounds<br>
or mixtures specifically mentioned in the present text.<br>

They have, for example, excellent activity against the development stages of ticks, such as, for<br>
example, Boophilus microplus, and against parasitic flies, such as, for example, Lucilia cuprina and<br>
against fleas, such as, for example, Ctenocephalides felis.<br>
The active compounds of the formula (T) according to the invention are also suitable for controlling<br>
arthropods which infest agricultural productive livestock, such as, for example, cattle, sheep, goats,<br>
horses, pigs, donkeys, camels, buffalo, rabbits, chickens, turkeys, ducks, geese and bees, other pets,<br>
such as, for example, dogs, cats, caged birds and aquarium fish, and also so-called test animals, such<br>
as, for example, hamsters, guinea pigs, rats and mice. By controlling these arthropods, cases of death<br>
and reduction in productivity (for meat; milk, wool, hides, eggs, honey etc.) should be diminished, so<br>
that more economic and easier animal husbandry is possible by use of the active compounds<br>
according to the invention.<br>
The active compounds according to the invention are used hi the veterinary sector in a known manner<br>
by entera] administration in the form of, for example, tablets, capsules, potions, drenches, granules,<br>
pastes, boluses, the feed-through process and suppositories, by parenteral administration, such as, for<br>
example, by injection (intramuscular, subcutaneous, intravenous, intraperitoneal and the like),<br>
implants by nasal administration, by dermal use in the form, for example, of dipping or bathing,<br>
spraying, pouring on and spotting on, washing and powdering, and also with the aid of moulded<br>
articles containing the active compound, such as collars, ear marks, tail marks, limb bands, halters,<br>
marking devices and the like.<br>
When used for cattle, poultry, pets and the like, the active compounds of the formula (I) can be used<br>
as formulations (for example powders, emulsions, free-flowing compositions), which comprise the<br>
active compounds in an amount of 1 to 80% by weight, directly or after 100 to 10 000-fold dilution,<br>
or they can be used as a chemical bath.<br>
It has furthermore been found that the compounds according to the invention also have a strong<br>
insecticidal action against insects which destroy industrial materials.<br>

Industrial materials in the present connection are to be understood as meaning non-living materials,<br>
such as, preferably, plastics, adhesives, sizes, papers and cards, leather, wood and processed wood<br>
products and coating compositions.<br>
Wood and processed wood products are materials to be protected, especially preferably, from insect<br>
infestation.<br>
Wood and processed wood products which can be protected by the agents according to the invention<br>
or mixtures comprising these are to be understood as meaning, for example:<br>
Building timber, wooden beams, railway sleepers, bridge components, boat jetties, wooden vehicles,<br>
boxes, pallets, containers, telegraph poles, wood panelling, wooden windows and doors, plywood,<br>
chipboard, joinery or wooden products which are used quite generally in house-building or in<br>
buildingjoinery.<br>
The active compounds can be used as such, in the form of concentrates or in generally customary<br>
formulations, such as powders, granules, solutions, suspensions, emulsions or pastes.<br>
The formulations mentioned can be prepared in a manner known per se, for example by mixing the<br>
active compounds with at least one solvent or diluent, emulsifier, dispersing agent and/or binder or<br>
fixing agent, a water repellent, if appropriate siccatives and UV stabilizers and if appropriate<br>
dyestuffs and pigments, and also other processing auxiliaries.<br>
The insecticidal compositions or concentrates used for the preservation of wood and wood-derived<br>
timber products comprise the active compound according to the invention in a concentration of<br>
0.0001 to 95% by weight, in particular 0.001 to 60% by weight.<br>
The amount of the compositions or concentrates employed depends on the nature and occurrence of<br>
the insects and on the medium. The optimum amount employed can be determined for the use in each<br>
case by a series of tests. In general, however, it is sufficient to employ 0.0001 to 20% by weight,<br>
preferably 0.001 to 10% by weight, of the active compound, based on the material to be preserved.<br>
Solvents and/or diluents which are used are an organic chemical solvent or solvent mixture and/or an<br>
oily or oil-like organic chemical solvent or solvent mixture of low volatDity and/or a polar organic<br>
chemical solvent or solvent mixture and/or water, and if appropriate an emulsifier and/or wetting<br>
agent.<br>
Organic chemical solvents which are preferably used are oily or oil-like solvents having an<br>
evaporation number above 35 and a flashpoint above 30°C, preferably above 45°C. Substances which<br>
are used as such oily or oil-like water-insoluble solvents of low volatility are appropriate mineral oils<br>
or aromatic fractions thereof, or solvent mixtures containing mineral oils, preferably white spirit,<br>
petroleum and/or alkylbenzene.<br>
Mineral oils having a boiling range from 170 to 220°C, white spirit having a boiling range from 170<br>
to 220°C, spindle oil having a boiling range from 250 to 3.50°C, petroleum and aromatics having a<br>
boiling range from 160 to 280°C, turpentine oil and the like, are advantageously employed.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, liquid aliphatic hydrocarbons having a boiling range from 180 to 210°C<br>
or high-boiling mixtures of aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons having a boiling range from 180 to<br>
220°C and/or spindle oil and/or monochloronaphthalene, preferably a-monochloronaphthalene, are<br>
used.<br>
The organic oily or oil-like solvents of low volatility which have an evaporation number above 35<br>
and a flashpoint above 30°C, preferably above 45°C, can be replaced in part by organic chemical<br>
solvents of high or medium volatility, provided that the solvent mixture likewise has an evaporation<br>
number above 35 and a flashpoint above 30°C, preferably above 45°C, and that the<br>
insecticide/fungicide mixture is soluble or emulsifiable in this solvent mixture.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, some of the organic chemical solvent or solvent mixture is<br>
replaced by an aliphatic polar organic chemical solvent or solvent mixture. Aliphatic organic<br>
chemical solvents containing hydroxyl and/or ester and/or ether groups, such as, for example, glycol<br>
ethers, esters or the like, are preferably used.<br>
Organic chemical binders which are used in the context of the present invention are the synthetic<br>
resins and/or binding drying oils which are known per se, are water-dilutable and/or are soluble or<br>
dispersible or emulsifiable in the organic chemical solvents employed, hi particular binders consisting<br>
of or comprising an acrylate resin, a vinyl resin, for example polyvinyl acetate, polyester resin,<br>
polycondensation or polyaddition resin, polyurethane resin, alkyd resin or modified alkyd resin,<br>
phenolic resin, hydrocarbon resin, such as indene-cumarone resin, silicone resin, drying vegetable oils<br>
and/or drying oils and/or physically drying binders based on a natural and/or synthetic resin.<br>
The synthetic resin used as the binder can be employed in the form of an emulsion, dispersion or<br>
solution. Bitumen or bituminous substances can also be used as binders in an amount of up to 10% by<br>
weight. DyestuSs, pigments, water-repelling agents, odour correctants and inhibitors or anticorrosive<br>
agents and the like which are known per se can additionally be employed.<br>
It is preferred according to the invention for the composition or concentrate to comprise, as the<br>
organic chemical binder, at least one alkyd resin or modified alkyd resin and/or a drying vegetable<br>
oil. Alkyd resins having an oil content of more than 45% by weight, preferably 50 to 68% by weight,<br>
are preferably used according to the invention.<br>
All or some of the binder mentioned can be replaced by a fixing agent (mixture) or a plasticizer<br>
(mixture). These additives are intended to prevent evaporation of the active compounds and<br>
crystallization or precipitation. They preferabry replace 0.01 to 30% of the binder (based on 100% of<br>
the binder employed).<br>
The plasticizers originate from the chemical classes of phthalic acid esters, such as dibutyl, dioctyl or<br>
benzyl butyl phthalate, phosphoric acid esters, such as tributyl phosphate, adipic acid esters, such as<br>
di-(2-ethylhexyl) adipate, stearates, such as butyl stearate or amyl stearate, oleates, such as butyl<br>
oleate, glycerol ethers or higher molecular weight glycol ethers, glycerol esters and ptoluenesulphonic<br>
acid esters.<br>
Fixing agents are based chemically on polyvinyl alky] ethers, such as, for example, polyvinyl methyl<br>
ether or ketones, such as benzophenone or ethylenebenzophenone.<br>
Possible solvents or diluents are, in particular, also water, if appropriate as a mixture with one or<br>
more of the abovementioned organic chemical solvents or diluents, emulsifiers and dispersing agents.<br>
Particularly effective preservation of wood is achieved by impregnation processes on a large<br>
industrial scale, for example vacuum, double vacuum or pressure processes.<br>
The ready-to-use compositions can also comprise other insecticides, if appropriate, and also one or<br>
more fungicides, if appropriate.<br>
Possible additional mixing partners are, preferably, the insecticides and fungicides mentioned in<br>
WO 94/29 268. The compounds mentioned hi this document are an explicit constituent of the present<br>
application.<br>
Especially preferred mixing partners which may be mentioned are insecticides, such as chlorpyriphos,<br>
phoxim, silafluofin, alphamethrin, cyfluthrin, cypermethrin, deltamethrin, permethrin, imidacloprid,<br>

carbamate, N-octyl-isothiazolin-3-one and 4,5-dichloro-N-octylisothiazolin-3-one.<br>
The compounds according to the invention can at the same time be employed for protecting objects<br>
which come into contact with saltwater or brackish water, such as hulls, screens, nets, buildings,<br>
moorings and signalling systems, against fouling.<br>
Fouling by sessile Oligochaeta, such as Serpulidae, and by shells and species from the Ledamorpha<br>
group (goose barnacles), such as various Lepas and Scalpellum species, or by species from the<br>
Balanomorpha group (acorn barnacles), such as Balanus or Pollicipes species, increases the fractional<br>
drag of ships and, as a consequence, leads to a marked increase in operational costs owing to higher<br>
energy consumption and additionally frequent residence in the dry dock.<br>
Apart from fouling by algae, for example Ectocarpus sp. and Ceramium sp., fouling by sessile<br>
Entomostraka groups, which come under the generic term Cirripedia (cirriped crustaceans), is of<br>
particular importance.<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that the compounds according to the invention, alone or in<br>
combination with other active compounds, have an outstanding antifouling action.<br>
