				<td>REALASED MOTION WINDING MACHINE FOR THERMOPLASTIC<br>
FIBRES<br>
The present invention relates to a device making it<br>
possible to ensure the drawing and winding of<br>
thermoplastic threads, in particular glass threads.<br>
It will be remembered that the manufacture of glass<br>
reinforcing threads is the result of a complex<br>
industrial process which involves obtaining threads<br>
from streams of molten glass flowing through spinneret<br>
orifices. These streams are drawn in the form of<br>
continuous filaments, and then these filaments are<br>
gathered together in the form of ground threads, the<br>
said threads being collected in the form of wound<br>
packages.<br>
Within the meaning of the invention, the wound packages<br>
are in the form of bobbins or, even more specifically,<br>
in the form of "cakes", these cakes being intended more<br>
particularly for reinforcing applications.<br>
Shaping in the form of a cake is carried out with the<br>
aid of winding machines which, as their name suggests,<br>
are responsible for winding at very high speed<br>
(approximately 10 to 50 meters per second) the glass<br>
threads which have previously been sized.<br>
These winding machines ensure the drawing and winding<br>
of these filaments, and the operating parameters of<br>
these winding machines, along with those of the<br>
spinneret, govern the dimensional characteristics of<br>
the thread, in particular the linear density expressed<br>
in tex (tex being the weight in grams of 1000 meters of<br>
fibers or threads).<br>
Thus, to ensure a constant linear density of the thread<br>
during the entire phase of preparation of the cake, in<br>
spite of the increase in its diameter, the speed of the<br><br>
winding member of the winding machine is controlled in<br>
such a way as to ensure a constant linear winding speed<br>
of the thread, even though its angular speed varies,<br>
this speed control being carried out by reducing the<br>
rotational speed of the spindle supporting the cake as<br>
a function of the increasing diameter of the latter.<br>
Another important parameter governing obtaining a cake<br>
of optimum quality is its capacity for being easily<br>
unwound, without the presence of loops or of disturbing<br>
knots, with friction being limited. This unwinding<br>
capacity is determined by the nature of the law of<br>
construction (determining the enlargement of the cake)<br>
which has been brought about by the winding machine<br>
during the formation of the cake. This law of<br>
construction incorporates numerous parameters, one of<br>
the most important of which is the crossing ratio,<br>
often called RC and the linear density of the thread.<br>
In order to impart a given crossing ratio to a cake,<br>
the winding machines of the prior art generate<br>
kinematics or a particular stroke in the thread from<br>
the combination of two movements. A first movement,<br>
which imparts a primary stroke to the thread, and a<br>
second movement, which imparts a secondary stroke to<br>
the thread, the first and second movements generally<br>
being applied by a single combined-movement member<br>
which is known more generally by the name of a crossing<br>
device.<br>
For practical purposes, the definition of the crossing<br>
ratio (RC) is given below:<br>
(RC) = Rotational speed of the spindle supporting and<br>
driving the cake/rotational speed of the crossing<br>
device.<br>
These known winding machines consist essentially of a<br>
frame, usually positioned underneath a spinneret, this<br><br>
frame supporting the crossing device and at least one<br>
spindle movable in rotation, this spindle being<br>
designed, on the one hand, to generate the cake and, on<br>
the other hand, to support the latter.<br>
Conventionally, a crossing device comprises a helically<br>
shaped member, this helix movable in rotation about an<br>
axis making it possible to position the thread on the<br>
rotating spindle, the movement imparted by the helix<br>
consisting essentially of an oscillating or beating<br>
movement solely over a portion of the length of the<br>
cake, this movement constituting the primary stroke.<br>
To obtain the full winding capacity, it is necessary<br>
that the helix or any other equivalent device, such as,<br>
in particular, a traveller movable linearly within a<br>
groove, can describe all or part of the length of the<br>
cake. For this purpose, in known winding machines, the<br>
helix is mounted movably in a relatively slow to-and-<br>
fro translational movement on a shaft integral with the<br>
frame and parallel to the axis of the spindle, this<br>
second translational movement imparting the secondary<br>
stroke to the thread and thus allowing it to cover all<br>
or part of the length of the cake.<br>
It will be understood that, in order to describe the<br>
entire length of the cake, the thread is displaced, to<br>
form a substantially immovable point essentially<br>
located downstream of the spinneret, in a cone, the<br>
aperture of which encompasses substantially the entire<br>
length of the cake.<br>
As regards cakes of conventional dimension and weight,<br>
these winding machines with combined primary and<br>
secondary strokes on the same axis are fully<br>
satisfactory.<br>
However, in order to anticipate the requirements as to<br>
the increase in output of the spinnerets (generally<br><br>
expressed in kg/day), which, of course, result in an<br>
increase in the dimension and weight of the cakes, it<br>
is not possible to employ these kinematics governing<br>
the correct winding of the wound package (and, above<br>
all, the subsequent optimum unwinding).<br>
In view of the increase in output of the spinnerets, it<br>
was expedient to design and develop spinnerets<br>
comprising a large number of holes (typically, several<br>
thousand) . The use of these spinnerets makes it<br>
necessary to divide the spinneret into a plurality of<br>
sheets of filaments and to combine a plurality of<br>
sheets (at least two) on the same spindle axis of a<br>
winding machine, so as thereby to carry out the drawing<br>
and winding of a plurality of cakes simultaneously.<br>
The formation of a plurality of cakes on the same<br>
spindle axis from a plurality of combined-movement<br>
crossing devices subjects the filaments coming from the<br>
same sheet and reunited within the same thread to<br>
constraints which limit the winding possibilities of<br>
current winding machines.<br>
Thus, as constraints, it may be noted that the use of a<br>
conventional crossing device (which has a combined<br>
movement, to be precise rotation at high speed and<br>
linear translation at slower speed) leads to<br>
appreciable variations in the path of the thread<br>
between the spinneret exit point and the point of<br>
application of the thread on the cake, these variations<br>
resulting in "unequal lengths" of the threads. On<br>
account of these length differences there is a risk<br>
that thread loops detrimental to unwinding are<br>
produced, and, moreover, these differences may be<br>
prejudicial to the process upstream of the winding<br>
machine.<br>
The present invention is therefore aimed at mitigating<br>
these disadvantages by proposing a winding device or<br><br>
winding machine which minimizes the differences in<br>
lengths and in tensions, this being achieved, whatever<br>
the winding capacity of the winding machine.<br>
For this purpose, the winding machine, consisting<br>
essentially of a frame, this frame comprising at least<br>
two spindles fastened to a barrel, the said spindles<br>
being, on the one hand, designed to support at least<br>
one cake, and, on the other hand, movable in rotation<br>
about a first axis substantially perpendicular to the<br>
diameter of the cake, and at least one positioning and<br>
guidance device designed to position and guide at least<br>
one thread on the rotating spindles, the said barrel<br>
being mounted movably in rotation with respect to the<br>
frame along a third axis of rotation substantially<br>
parallel to the first axis, characterized in that the<br>
spindles are mounted so as to be movable linearly along<br>
the first axis of rotation or in that the frame cooperates<br>
 with the barrel by means of an indexing device<br>
which makes it possible to control the position of the<br>
said barrel with respect to the said frame.<br>
By means of these arrangements, and, in particular, of<br>
the uncoupling of the movements between the primary<br>
stroke of the device for the positioning and guidance<br>
of the thread and the secondary stroke of the spindle,<br>
it is possible to obtain cakes having an optimum<br>
capacity for the winding and unwinding of the glass<br>
threads.<br>
This capacity for winding and unwinding the threads is<br>
optimum by continuously controlling the position and/or<br>
the angular speed of the barrel supporting the<br>
spindles, it being possible for this control to be<br>
carried out regardless of whether there is uncoupling<br>
or not between the primary stroke movements of the<br>
device for the positioning and guidance of the thread<br>
and of the secondary stroke movements of the spindle.<br><br>
In preferred embodiments of the invention, moreover,<br>
where appropriate, one and/or the other of the<br>
following arrangements may be adopted:<br>
the positioning and guidance device consists<br>
essentially of at least one helix mounted<br>
movably in rotation about the second axis,<br>
the positioning and guidance device consists<br>
essentially of at least one wheel provided with<br>
at least one groove, this groove being designed<br>
to position and guide at least one thread, the<br>
said wheel being movable in rotation about a<br>
second axis substantially parallel to the first<br>
axis,<br>
the positioning and guidance device consists<br>
essentially of at least one traveller, the said<br>
traveller being designed to position and guide<br>
at least one thread and to be displaced<br>
linearly along a second axis substantially<br>
parallel to the first axis,<br>
the indexing device is designed to modify<br>
continuously the angular position of the barrel<br>
with respect to the frame as a function of the<br>
variation in the outside diameter of the cake,<br>
so as to permanently control the path of the<br>
thread between its exit point from the<br>
positioning and guidance device and its contact<br>
point on the periphery of the cake,<br>
the spindle is actuated in rotation by means of<br>
a kinematic chain comprising a motor<br>
incorporated in the said spindle,<br>
the winding machine comprises a device for<br>
driving the thread or thread drawer consisting<br>
essentially of at least two motor-driven<br>
rollers, the driving device being fastened to<br>
the frame of the said winding machine,<br>
the winding machine comprises a straight<br>
ejector designed to position the threads at the<br>
end of the spindle,<br><br>
the winding machine comprises a thread<br>
retraction device designed to grasp and<br>
displace the threads between a first position,<br>
in which the threads are in engagement with the<br>
device for the positioning and guidance of the<br>
threads, and a second position, in which the<br>
threads are retracted from the said positioning<br>
and guidance device,<br>
the spindle and its drive motor are integral<br>
with a linear actuator, the said actuator being<br>
designed to ensure the to-and-fro movement of<br>
the said spindle,<br>
the winding machine comprises a control and<br>
command device making it possible, in<br>
particular, to ensure a regulation of speed<br>
and/or of position between the primary stroke<br>
movement of the positioning and guidance device<br>
and the secondary stroke movement of at least<br>
one of the spindles.<br>
Other characteristics and advantages of the invention<br>
may be gathered from the following description of one<br>
of its embodiments given by way of non-limiting<br>
example, with reference to the accompanying drawings in<br>
which:<br>
Figures la and lb are respectively diagrammatic<br>
front and side views of a winding machine of<br>
the invention,<br>
Figure 2 is a front view of the winding machine<br>
in the stand-by state,<br>
Figures 3a and 3b are front views of the<br>
winding machine in a start-up state,<br>
Figure 4 is a front view of the winding machine<br>
in a winding state.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of a winding machine 1 of the<br>
invention, illustrated in Figures la and lb, the latter<br>
comprises a metal frame 2 obtained by means of a<br>
mechanical-welding technique of metal elements<br><br>
previously machined or available as standard in the<br>
trade. This frame 2 comprises essentially a<br>
substantially rectangular base 3 resting on feet<br>
carefully placed so as to match the gauge or spacing of<br>
the forks of a pallet truck or of a similar handling<br>
device, in order to make it easier to install this<br>
winding machine in a fiber-drawing position.<br>
Assembled on this base is a partially cowled closed<br>
structure 4 which is intended for receiving all the<br>
components necessary for the operation of the winding<br>
machine 1. In this regard, and in a non-limiting way,<br>
this closed structure shaped as a cabinet is provided<br>
with the control and command devices necessary for the<br>
various regulations of the various members which will<br>
be described later in the present description, and with<br>
hydraulic, electrical and compressed-air networks and<br>
networks for other fluids necessary for the operation<br>
of the said members.<br>
A barrel 5 which projects laterally co-operates on the<br>
closed structure 4 This barrel 5 is mounted movably in<br>
rotation about an axis of rotation (called the third<br>
axis of rotation) and is held within one of the walls<br>
of the closed structure by means of a plurality of<br>
guide members (for example, ball-bearing ring, ballbearing<br>
 traveller). There is provision, moreover, for<br>
the motor drive of this barrel 5, so that it can<br>
describe and index a plurality of angular positions<br>
with respect to the frame 2 during the winding of the<br>
cakes.<br>
To be precise, this barrel 5 forms a spindle support<br>
assembly. In Figures la and lb, it can be seen that the<br>
barrel 5 has two spindles 6, 7, in diametrically<br>
opposed positions (it would be conceivable to have a<br>
barrel comprising at least three or four spindles, or<br>
even more, depending on the available overall size and<br>
on the capacities of the spinneret positioned<br><br>
upstream). Within the winding machine, the barrel 5<br>
makes it possible to bring a previously unloaded<br>
spindle equipped with at least one empty sleeve tube<br>
(within the meaning of the invention, a sleeve tube is<br>
a support made of plastic or of cardboard which is<br>
intended for receiving the wound package of threads or<br>
the cake) into the winding position and another spindle<br>
with its sleeve tubes full into an unloading position<br>
as a result of rotations through 180° (if the barrel<br>
comprises two spindles, as may be gathered from the<br>
examples).<br>
By means of the motor drive of the barrel 5 and of a<br>
regulation of its angular position and/or of its<br>
angular speed, for example by means of a control of the<br>
number of revolutions of the geared motor responsible<br>
for driving the barrel, this geared motor being in<br>
engagement, for example, with the barrel 5 in the<br>
region of its drive shaft by means of a connection of<br>
the gear type, it becomes possible to position the<br>
active spindle substantially in the vicinity of the<br>
thread and that the said active spindle moves back or<br>
moves away from its initial angular position during the<br>
enlargement of the cake, so as to preserve a controlled<br>
geometry.<br>
Each of the spindles 6, 7 integral with the barrel 5<br>
forms a rotating assembly designed for winding the<br>
thread onto a sleeve tube previously introduced onto<br>
the quill or spindle nose. This winding takes place<br>
along a first axis of rotation substantially parallel<br>
to the axis of rotation of the barrel 5 with respect to<br>
the structure of the frame 2. In addition to a<br>
rotational movement caused by a rotor motor<br>
incorporated in the spindle about this first axis, the<br>
spindle is designed to be capable of executing a to-<br>
and-fro stroke parallel to the first axis of rotation.<br>
This to-and-fro movement is caused by a motor-driven<br>
linear movement actuator (for example ball screw),<br><br>
integral, on the one hand, with the barrel or with the<br>
frame and, on the other hand, with the body of the<br>
spindle.<br>
Another element which is essential for the production<br>
of a cake can be seen in Figures la and lb. This is the<br>
device 8 for the positioning and guidance of the thread<br>
on the spindle 6 or 7. In this example, this is a<br>
helix. This helix is actuated in rotation by a drive<br>
member about a shaft coaxial with a second axis<br>
substantially parallel to those mentioned above. The<br>
rotational speed of the drive member of the helix is<br>
regulated as a function of the law of construction of<br>
the cake, and there is provision for these control and<br>
command devices to be incorporated within the structure<br>
2 forming a frame.<br>
Of course, if a plurality of cakes are to be produced<br>
simultaneously on the same spindle 6 or 7, the number<br>
of helices 8 will be adapted accordingly, and the helix<br>
support shaft will comprise a train of helices, the<br>
number of which will be equal to the number of cakes<br>
desired.<br>
The rotational movement of the helix results, at the<br>
thread, in an oscillating or beating movement, the<br>
amplitude and frequency of which can be set as a<br>
function of the values of the desired crossing ratio.<br>
The frequency is determined as a function of the<br>
rotational speed and the amplitude as a function of the<br>
geometry of the helix.<br>
Other devices, not illustrated in the figures, may be<br>
envisaged as a replacement for the helix. These may be<br>
a wheel provided with at least one groove, this groove<br>
being designed for positioning and guiding at least one<br>
thread, the said wheel being movable in rotation about<br>
a second axis substantially parallel to the first axis.<br><br>
There may also be a traveller, the said traveller being<br>
designed to position and guide at least one thread and<br>
to be displaced linearly along a second axis<br>
substantially parallel to the first axis.<br>
Whatever the embodiment of the device 8 for the<br>
positioning and guidance of the thread, it executes<br>
what is referred to as a primary stroke movement and<br>
functions, in terms of the regulation of speed and,<br>
where appropriate, of position, with the to-and-fro<br>
movement of the spindle 6 or 7 which constitutes what<br>
is referred to as the secondary stroke movement.<br>
According to one advantage of the invention, the<br>
primary and secondary strokes of the winding machine 1<br>
are uncoupled. It is possible to obtain a wide range of<br>
laws of construction and of crossing ratios, thus<br>
making it possible to manufacture cakes of large mass<br>
(between 25 and 50 kg or more) and with a highly<br>
accurate construction which is conducive to unwinding.<br>
According to another embodiment of the invention, it is<br>
possible to obtain particular geometries by combining,<br>
simultaneously and/or in succession, the uncoupled or<br>
coupled movements of the primary and secondary strokes,<br>
with a controlled movement in the angular position<br>
and/or in the speed of the barrel supporting the<br>
spindles.<br>
It is possible, on the winding machine which is the<br>
subject of the invention, to produce a cake which has<br>
been obtained from a single secondary stroke movement<br>
for the entire duration of winding.<br>
Other subassemblies necessary for the operation of the<br>
winding machine 1 are incorporated within the frame 2 .<br>
Thus, a thread drawer 9 is positioned in the region of<br>
the base 3 of the frame 2. A thread drawer 9 is a<br>
thread drive assembly which is used during the start-<br><br>
up, the start-up being a transient phase prior to a<br>
winding phase. For this purpose, the thread is drawn by<br>
means of a train of motor-driven rollers with smooth<br>
walls or with reliefs (the threads are delivered under<br>
operating conditions compatible with the engagement of<br>
the threads within the spindle nose during the starting<br>
of the winding phase).<br>
The winding comprises at least one rotary ejector 10<br>
and at least one straight ejector 11, these projecting<br>
laterally with respect to the closed structure 2 and in<br>
line with the barrel 5.<br>
The rotor ejector 10 or the retraction device consists<br>
of an arm articulated at one of its ends on the closed<br>
structure of the frame 2, and its free end is designed<br>
to grasp and displace the threads between a first<br>
position, in which the threads are in engagement with<br>
the device for the positioning and guidance of the<br>
thread 8 (for example, the helix), and a second<br>
position in which the threads are retracted with<br>
respect to the said positioning and guidance device 8.<br>
The angular movement of the rotary ejector 10 is<br>
carried out during the change of spindle 6 or 7<br>
(pivoting of the barrel 5 through 180°).<br>
The straight ejector 11, as its name suggests, is a<br>
substantially rectilinear arm. Projecting laterally,<br>
like the rotary ejector 10, with respect to a side wall<br>
of the closed structure of the frame 2, it can occupy<br>
two positions: a position of rest, in which it retreats<br>
from the path of the thread, and a working position, in<br>
which it holds the thread above the nose of the spindle<br>
6 or 7 during the start-up. This working position is<br>
likewise occupied during the transfer operation<br>
(rotation of the barrel, and passage from a spindle<br>
with wound cakes to a spindle with empty sleeve tubes).<br><br>
In the vicinity of the device for the positioning and<br>
guidance of the thread 8 (for example, helix) is<br>
positioned a member (which cannot be seen in the<br>
figures) for cleaning the said positioning device by<br>
sprinkling with a fluid under pressure.<br>
Figures 2, 3a, 3b, 4 illustrate the various states<br>
which the winding machine can occupy.<br>
In Figure 2, the winding machine 1 is in the stand-by<br>
state. The threads descend from the spinneret bottom<br>
and fall vertically into a reject bin. These threads<br>
escape from the winding machine in line with the<br>
spindles 6 or 7.<br>
In Figures 3a and 3b, the winding machine 1 is in the<br>
start-up state. Each of the spindles 6 or 7 is provided<br>
with empty sleeve tubes (generally two or three juxta-<br>
posed) . The operator grasps the threads which emerge<br>
from the spinneret bottom and directs them towards the<br>
thread drawer 9. The drive rollers of the thread drawer<br>
9 grip the threads and draw the threads until these are<br>
brought under conditions suitable for starting<br>
(Figure 3a).<br>
The straight ejector 11 is in the working position, in<br>
order to make it possible to engage the threads within<br>
hooks or the like present at the end and on the<br>
periphery of the nose of the spindle 6 or 7.<br>
The motor for rotating the spindle 6 or 7 provided with<br>
the sleeve tubes is started, and the control and<br>
command device for the primary and secondary strokes,<br>
and for the position of the barrel, is initialized<br>
(execution of the law of construction).<br>
At this stage, the straight ejector 11 is returned to<br>
the position of rest, and the threads are positioned<br>
directly on the sleeve tubes (refer to Figure 3b).<br><br>
Figure 4 illustrates the winding state. The spindle has<br>
reached its initial winding speed. The straight ejector<br>
11 is in the retracted position (state of rest) , and<br>
the rotary ejector 10 executes an angular movement, so<br>
as to bring the threads into contact with the device 8<br>
for the positioning and guidance of the threads (for<br>
example, helix), in such a way that it can generate its<br>
primary stroke.<br>
As the winding progresses (as the increase in thickness<br>
of threads in the region of the cakes progresses), the<br>
barrel 5 carries out an angular correction by rotation<br>
and by the indexing of its angular position about its<br>
axis, so as to move the "active" spindle - that where<br>
the winding of the device takes place - away from the<br>
periphery of the device for the positioning and<br>
guidance of the thread, so as to preserve a controlled<br>
geometry.<br>
The winding is active, and the primary stroke and<br>
secondary stroke movements, and the conrtol of the<br>
position and/or of the angular speed of the barrel, are<br>
controlled by the control and command device, so as to<br>
conform to the law of construction. This is made<br>
possible by the use of a digital technology which makes<br>
it possible to fix the position and/or speed of all of<br>
the actuators.<br><br>
