				<td>This invention relates to an apparatus for spraying a processing lubricant / solvent on the internal surface of a green tyre.<br>
The spraying is done prior to vulcanisation and this is necessary to protect the integrity of the inside tyre surface during the shaping operation which takes place during the process of vulcanisation.<br>
According to the prior art, a spray gun is employed for the purpose of spraying the processing lubricant / solvent on the internal surface of a green tyre.<br>
The problems associated with a spray gun are :<br>
(I)	clogging at the spray tip<br>
(II)	enlargement of the tip of the spray gun over prolonged use<br>
(ill) maintaining air quality, which is a difficult task <iv air filters are to be periodically cleaned and maintained in order avoid contamination by foreign particles moisture content affects the spray mixture.></iv><br>
On the other hand the apparatus proposed herein is free from the above problems.  Once the apparatus  proposed herein   is  activated,  the  spraying   operation   is automatic.<br>
Various other features of this invention will be apparent from the further description thereof given hereunder.<br>
The  apparatus  for spraying a processing  lubricant  /<br>
solvent   on  the  internal surface of  a  green  tyre,<br>
according to this invention, comprises a  motor-spindle<br>
assembly,  one end of the spindle being connected to  a<br>
disc,  the other end of the spindle being connected  to<br>
the motor; a lid  disposed above the disc; means  for<br>
•K   lowering the disc into, and raising the same out of, L<br>
green  tyre placed below the disc on a platform^  jihe<br>
j(	disc,  during  its downward pass into the  tyre /, being<br>
rotatably  driven by the motor; a tank  containing  the processing   lubricant / solvent;   and   means   for providing  a  regulated  delivery  of  the   processing lubricant / solvent  from the tank on  to  the  upper surface of the rotating disc, only  during Its downward pass, to cause the processing lubricant / solvent to be<br><br>
sprayed around the internal surface of the tyre, the disc, thereafter, on its upward pass, exitir^ the tyre.<br>
The apparatus proposed herein will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, the single Figure therein illustrating, by way of example, and not by way of limitation, one of various possible embodiments of this invention.<br>
The motor-spindle assembly is indicated by 2. A flange type motor 14 which is capable of rotating at a predetermined speed is used. One end of the spindle 13 is connected to a disc 6, the other end of the spindle being connected to the motor 14 through a flexible coup]ing.<br>
A 1 id 5 disposed above the disc is used to cover the green tyre 15 during the spraying operation, to contain the spray within the tyre. The tyre is placed below the disc on a platform 16. Guide shafts 4 guide the lid 5 during movement.<br>
Means are provided for lowering the disc into, and raising the same out of, the tyre opening, the disc, during its downward pass into the tyre being rotatably driven  by the motor 14. In the embodiment  illustrated<br><br>
such means comprise a pneumatic device 1 which, when activated, lowers the motor-spindle assembly to enable the disc to enter the tyre from the level of the upper bead 17 thereof right down to the level of the lower bead; and subsequently raises the said assembly to enable the disc to exit the tyre.<br>
A stirrer tank 9 contains the processing lubricant / solvent which Is ultimately to be sprayed on the Internal surface of the tyre. The tank Is fitted with a stirrer driven by a diaphragm motor for effectively maintaining the processing lubricant / solvent in stirred condition.<br>
Means  are  provided  for  regulated  delivery  of  the processing lubricant / solvent from the tank on to  the upper surface 18 of the disc, only  during the  downward pass of the disc 6 into the tyre opening (during which pass  the  disc is rotatably driven by  the  motor) to cause the processing lubricant / solvent to be  sprayed around the internal surface of the tyre.  On completion of this operation, the disc is caused to be raised,  by the pneumatic device 1, to exit the tyre.<br>
One  form of such means for regulated delivery  of  the<br><br>
processing  lubricant / solvent from the tank 9  on  to the  upper surface 16 of the disc,  comprises a  do.$lng pump  6 provided with  dosing valve 11 for pumping  the processing  lubricant / solvent from the  tank  to  a midget  cylinder assembly 12 which Is employed for  the circulation and delivery of the processing lubricant / solvent.   The processing lubricant / solvent Is pumped by  the  pump 8  through the sl.eilve«yl Ine 7a  Into  the midget  cylinder  assembly  12.  The  said   processing lubricant / solvent  Is  then  delivered  on  to  the rotating  disc  6  through  line  7b  by  means  of  an automatic  action of the midget cylinder  assembly  12. The processing lubricant / solvent returns to the  tank 9 through the return line 7c.<br>
As stated above, as the disc 6 is lowered and enters the tyre opening, the 1 id 5 is caused to seat itself on the upper bead of the tyre, to prevent the processing lubricant / solvent from splashing out, during the spraying operation.<br>
A foot valve 10 is provided for the processing lubricant / solvent circulation line.<br>
Guide shafts 3 are employed for the motor'splnd1e assembly for its smooth up and down movement.<br><br>
The terms and expressions in this specification are of description and not of limitation, there being no intention of excluding any equivalents of the features Illustrated and described, since various other embodiments of the apparatus proposed herein are possible without departing from the scope and ambit of this Invention.<br><br><br>
