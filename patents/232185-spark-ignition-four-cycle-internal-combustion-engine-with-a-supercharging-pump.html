				<td>[DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION]<br>
[Technical Field of the Invention] This invention relates to a spark ignition four-cycle internal combustion engine with a supercharging pump (referred to as four-cycle internal combustion engine as so-called hereinafter) structured so that air supply pressurized by a supercharging pump is supercharged to a combustion chamber not through an intake valve but though a supercharging valve.<br>
[Prior Art]<br>
Japanese Patent Publication No. Sho_63-5562 and Japanese Kokai Publication No. Hei 7-10992J) disclose a spark ignition four-cycle internal combustion engine for supercharging pressurized air supply pressurized by a supercharging pump to a combustion chamber not though an air intake valve but though a supercharging valve.<br>
In a spark ignition four-cycle internal combustion engine disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. Sho 63-5562, a built-in air intake passage of a carburetor is branched to a main air intake passage and a sub air intake passage, fuel-air mixture which passes in the main air intake passage is supplied to a combustion chamber of an internal combustion engine though a reed valve and main intake valve, on the other hand, fuel-air mixture which passes the sub air intake passage is pressurized by supercharging pump and supplied to the combustion chamber through a sub air intake valve.In a spark ignition four-cycle internal combustion engine disclosed in Japanese Patent Kokai Publication No. Hei 7-109929, each upstream of a main air intake passage and<br>
sub air intake passage which are formed in parallel is connected to an air cleaner respectively, and each downstream end of the main air intake passage and the sub air intake passage is connected respectively to the combustion chamber of an internal combustion engine through an intake valve, the main air intake passage is provided with a carburetor and the sub air intake passage is provided with a reciprocating type supercharging pump.<br>
[Problem to be Solved by the Invention] In the spark ignition four-cycle internal<br>
combustion engine disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. Sho 63-5562, because an supercharging pump is provided on a cylinder head where an intake valve is provided, and connected to a cam shaft with interposition of a transmission member, a passage volume through which the pressurized fuel-air mixture passes is not so much increased, and the response speed is high, however, the required transmission system results in a complex structure and a large-sized internal combustion engine as a whole.<br>
In the spark ignition four-cycle internal combustion engine disclosed in Japanese Patent Kokai Publication No. Hei-7-109929, because air intake is<br>
supercharged by reciprocal motion of a piston connected to a crank shaft of an internal combustion engine, the air intake passage volume of the space from a supercharging pump to the intake valve is large, and the response speed and efficiency are poor, and a large-sized supercharging pump is required to secure a certain quantity of supercharging supply because the reciprocating type supercharging pump is a single acting type pump.<br>
[Means for Solving the Problem and Effects] The present invention relates to modification of a spark ignition four-cycle internal combustion engine with a supercharging pump form which the above-mentioned problems are solved, the invention described in claim 1 provides a spark ignition four-cycle internal combustion engine with a supercharging pump having a structure in which air supply pressurized by a supercharging pump is supercharged to a combustion chamber not through an intake valve but through a supercharging valve, wherein the spark ignition four-cycle internal combustion engine with a supercharging pump has a supercharging pump driven by a intake and exhaust valve driving cam shaft supported on a cylinder head located on the axis line of the cam shaft.<br>
Because the spark ignition four-cycle internal combustion engine with a supercharging pump described in claim 1 is structured as described in claim 1, the air intake passage from the supercharging pump to the air intake valve is short, the reduced passage volume results in improved response speed and efficiency.<br>
By structuring the spark ignition four-cycle internal combustion engine with a supercharging pump of the present invention as described in claim 2, the power transmission system between the cam shaft and supercharging pump is eliminated, the elimination leads to a simplified and compact structure, and leads to a reduced cost.<br>
Further, by structuring the spark ignition four-cycle internal combustion engine with a supercharging pump of the present invention as described in claim 3, the supercharging pump can be provided near the intake and exhaust valve without interference with a valve gear driving system of an intake valve driving cam shaft, the cylinder head of an internal combustion engine is structured compact, and thus an internal combustion engine can be further made small sized.<br>
Yet further, by structuring the spark ignition four-cycle internal combustion engine with a supercharging pump of the present invention as described in claim 4, a supercharging pump can be further made small sized.<br>
By structuring the spark ignition four-cycle internal combustion engine with a supercharging pump of the present invention as described in claim 5, fuel in fuel-air mixture is dispersed homogeneously in the supercharging pump.<br>
By structuring the spark ignition four-cycle internal combustion engine with a supercharging pump of the present invention as described in claim 6, the intake period of a normal intake without supercharging is extended, and spitting due to pressurized supercharging air supply is prevented, thus trapping efficiency is greatly improved.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a spark ignition four-cycle internal combustion engine with a supercharging pump having a structure in which air supply pressurized by a supercharging pump is supercharged to a combustion chamber not through an intake valve but through a supercharging valve, said spark ignition four-cycle internal combustion engine with a supercharging pump having a supercharging pump driven by an intake and exhaust valve driving cam shaft supported on a cylinder head located on the axis line of said cam shaft<br>

As shown in FIG. 1, a soft seal member 77 made of rubber or synthetic plastics is fitted on the surface of the valve guide 22 which is exposed in the supercharging port 16 and on a stem member 19a of the supercharging valve 19 which projects from the valve guide 22, a band 77a is fitted on the peripheral surface of the soft seal member 77 to prevent<br>
the soft seal member 77 from falling.<br>
The embodiment shown in FIG. 1 to FIG. 10 is structured as described herein above, in the operation of the air-cooled overhead valve spark ignition single cylinder four-cycle internal combustion engine 1, the air intake valve 20 and the exhaust valve 21 are operated to open and close at the timing as shown in FIG. 11 during two revolution of the crank shaft 7, and also the supercharging valve 19 is driven to open and close, fuel-air mixture charged into the combustion chamber 14 by operating the air intake valve 20 to open and pressurized fuel-air mixture supercharged into the combustion chamber 14 by operating the supercharging valve 19 to open are ignited with a spark of the spark plug 15 at the timing near the top dead center, expansion of the combustion gas lowers the piston 9 to rotating-drive the crank shaft 7 with interposition of the connecting rod 12 .<br>
Because the supercharging pump 40 is directly connected to the cam shaft 25, the driving system of the supercharging pump 40 has a very simple structure.  Further, because the supercharging pump 40 is located on the end of the cam shaft 25 located opposite side to the driven sprocket 33 of the valve gear system, the structure near the cam shaft<br>
25 is simplified.<br>
Because the supercharging pump 40 is located near the combustion chamber 14 of the air-cooled overhead valve spark ignition single cylinder four-cycle internal combustion engine 1, the supercharging passage from the supercharging pump 40 to the combustion chamber 14 is greatly shortened, and the supercharging efficiency and response speed is maintained at a high level.<br>
Further as shown in FIG. 9, pressurized fuel-air mixture pressurized by the supercharging pump 40 is supplied into the combustion chamber 14 with opening of the supercharging valve 19 at the timing near the bottom dead center when an intake stroke of fuel-air mixture with opening of the air intake valve 20 is almost completed, the pressurized fuel-air mixture will not be spat from the air intake valve 20 to the upstream air intake passage, fuel-air mixture is supercharged smoothly to the air-cooled overhead valve spark ignition single cylinder four-cycle internal combustion engine 1 without increased cubic capacity, and the output can be very high.<br>
Because the supercharging pump 40 is double acting<br>
type, even if the cam shaft 25 and crank shaft 45 of the supercharging pump 40 are rotated at a rotation speed half that of the crank shaft 7 of the air-cooled overhead valve spark ignition single cylinder four-cycle internal combustion engine 1, pressurized fuel-air mixture is supercharged sufficiently into the combustion chamber 14 due to high supercharging capacity in comparison with the whole size of the supercharging pump 40.<br>
Because the supercharging pump 40 is provided with the intake lead valve 55 and the discharge lead valve 57 which are operated automatically to open and close correspondingly to the pressure difference, the structure can be simplified and made compact, and leads to a reduced cost.<br>
A tappet clearance between the supercharging valve 19 and the supercharging cam 37 is adjustable very simply and properly by moving the supercharging cam 37 in the axial direction with respect to the cam shaft 25 with replacing the shim 36 having different thickness.<br>
Further, because the seal member 77 is provided on the stem member 19a of the supercharging valve 19 and on the surface 16a of the supercharge port 16 side of the valve<br>
guide 22, pressurized fuel-air mixture in the supercharge port 16 presses the seal member 77 onto the supercharge port 16 side surface of the valve guide 22, the clearance between the stem member 19a of the supercharging valve 19 and the valve guide 22 is sealed, and leakage of fuel-air mixture is prevented. When the supercharging valve 19 is opened, the exhaust valve 21 is closed, and pressurized fuel-air mixture having a pressure higher than exhaust gas in the combustion chamber 14 is charged into the supercharge port 16, such condition prevents exhaust gas in the combustion chamber 14 from leaking into the supercharge port 16, and the seal member 77 will not be damaged due to high temperature exhaust gas.Because the supercharge port 16 and the air intake port 17 are located so that the extension line of the supercharge port and the extension line of the air intake port 17 are orthogonal in the top view and the extension lines intersect each other, fuel-air mixture is mixed homogeneously and a spark goes from the spark plug toward the intersection, such condition facilitates smooth ignition.<br>
In the embodiment shown in FIG. 1 to FIG. 10, the<br>
crank shaft 45 of the supercharging pump 40 connected directly to the cam shaft 25 is connected to the piston with interposition of the connecting rod 49, however, as shown in FIG. 12 a structure in which a small diameter member 45a of the crank shaft 45 of the supercharging pump connected directly to the cam shaft 25 is fixed in a longitudinal groove (in the direction perpendicular to the paper plane) of the piston 44 as shown in FIG. 12 may be used.<br>
Also such structure may be used for reciprocating motion of the piston to rotate the crank shaft 45.<br>
In the air-cooled overhead valve spark ignition single cylinder four-cycle internal combustion engine 1 shown in FIG. 11, the top end of the stems 20a and 21a of the air intake valve 20 and the exhaust valve 21 located on the right and left corresponds respectively to the cam tops 25a and 25b of the reference conical surface, the top end of the stem 19a of the supercharging valve 19 is brought into contact with the cam top 25c of the reference cylindrical surface, and only the cam top 25 b is adjustable in the axial direction with respect to the cam shaft 25, however, if the cam top 25a is structured so as to be adjustable in the axial direction, then the tappet clearance of the air intake valve<br>
20 and the exhaust valve 21 becomes easily adjustable.<br>
In the air-cooled overhead valve spark ignition single cylinder four-cycle internal combustion engine 1 shown in the drawings, fuel-air mixture which is formed by mixing previously air and fuel in the carburetor is supplied to the combustion chamber 14, this invention may be applied to an internal combustion engine having a structure in which only air is supplied instead of fuel-air mixture and fuel is injected directly into the combustion chamber 14.<br>
