				<td>The invention relates to an apparatus for controlling the motors tor a compressor and a blower of an air conditioner, and more particularly, to a control method and an apparatus for controlling motors of an air conditioner, the invention providing that the compressor and blower, and a converter to obtain a DC voltage necessary for an inverter to drive the compressor and blower are controlled by a single microcomputer.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART<br>
Hitherto, an air conditioner has had control means of motors to drive a<br>
compressor and blower, respectively. For example, in the driving of the<br>
motor for the compressor, a commercially available AC power is converted<br>
to a DC power and the converted DC power is converted to an arbitrary- AC<br>
voltage by	<br><br><br>
the control means and is supplied to the motor for ths com ' pressor. A capacitor input type converter is generally used as converting means for converting the AC power to the DC power. However^ since an input alternating current waveforin from the AC power becomes a distorted wave, the power factor deteriorates and a harmonics current is generated.<br>
Therefore, various converters for setting an input alterna¬ting current waveform to a sine wave of the same phase as that of an input voltage, for improving the input power fac¬tor, and for reducing the harmonics have been proposed. The air conditioner using the converter drives the motors for the compressor and blower and is controlled by a microcomputer. An example of such a control will now be described in detail with reference to Fig. 10.<br>
The control apparatus of the air conditioner comprises: a converter circuit 2 for converting a commercially available AC power 1 to a DC power; a first inverter circuit 4 for converting the output DC voltage of the converter circuit 2 to a predetermined AC voltage and supplying it to a first brushless motor 3 for,the compressor; a converter control circuit 5 for outputting an IGBT (a transistor) control si¬gnal in accordance with the input current (rectified cur¬rent), the input voltage (rectified voltage), and the output voltage in the converter circuit 2 and on/off driving an IGBT (transistor) 2a. as a switching means; a position detecting circuit 6 for detecting the position of the rotor of the first brushless motor , 3 by a terminal voltage of the brushless motor 3; a microcomputer 7 for inputting the detec¬ted position detecting signals and outputting an inverter control signal (PWM signal = pulse-width modulation signal) for on/off.controlling at least a plurality of transistors Ua, Va, Wa, Xa, Ya, and za of the first inverter circuit 4 on the basis of the inputted position detecting signals; an upper arm drive circuit 8 and a lower arm drive circuit 9 for<br><br>
inputting such a control signal and on/off driving the tran¬sistors Ua, Va, Wa, Xa, Ya, and Za; a chopping circuit 10 for chopping as desired the onportions of output drive signals of the upper arm drive circuit 8 by a chopping signal from the microcomputer 7; a switching power circuit 11 for converting the commercial AC power 1 to a predetermined DC power; a second inverter circuit 13 for converting the output DC vol¬tage of the switching power circuit 11 to a predetermined AC voltage and supplying it to a second brushless motor 12 for an outdoor side blov/er; and a brushless motor control circuit 14 for inputting position detecting signals of a rotor of the second brushless motor 12 that are generated from a Hall element 12a in the brushless motor 12, for inputting a rota¬tional speed command signal from the microcomputer 1, and for outputting an inverter control signal to turn on/off at least a transistor lid as switching means of the switching power circuit 11 and to turn on/off a plurality of transistors Ub, Vb, Wb, Xb, Yb, and Zb of the second inverter circuit 13 on the basis of the inputted position detecting signals.<br>
In addition to the IGBT 2a of the switching means, the con¬verter circuit 2 conprises a rectifying circuit 2b for recti¬fying the commercial AC power 1 to the, direct current, a reactor 2c, a diode 2d for blocking a reverse current, and a smoothing capacitor 2e. The converter circuit 2 converts the commercial AC power 1 to the DC power and supplies a prede¬termined DC voltage to the first inverter circuit 4.<br>
The first inverter circuit 4 is constructed by: an upper arm comprising the three transistors Ua, Va, and Wa for switching the connections between a positive terminal of the converter circuit 2 and three-phase windings al, bl, and cl of the first brushless motcr 3; and a lower arm comprising the three transistors Xa, Ya, and Za for. switching the connections between the 3-phase windings al, h\, and cl and a negative terminal of the converter circuit 2.<br><br>
The converter control circuit 5 comprises:'a current detec¬ting circuit; two voltage detecting circuits; an IGBT driving circuit; an exclusive-use IC for a converter control having a PWM signal generating circuit constructed by an oscillator a multiplier, a comparator,■etc.; and the like. The converter control circuit 5 detects the current by using a current sensor 5a, detects the voltage v;aveform obtained by rectify¬ing the AC voltage, detects the output DC voltage, and gene¬rates a control signal [PWM signal: shovm in Fig. 11(a)] for controlling the IGBT 2a of the converter circuit 2 by those detected current and voltage in a manner such that the input AC current from the AC power has a sine wave of the same phase as that of the input AC voltage (shown in Fig. 11(b)).<br>
The microcomputer 7 inputs the position detecting signals [shown in (a) to (c) in Fig. 12] from the position detecting circuit 6 and generates drive signals Ual, Val, Wal, Xal, Yal, and Zal shown in (d) to (i) in Fig. 12 to the upper arm drive circuit 8 and lower arm drive circuit 9 in order to turn on as desired the transistors Ua, Va, and Wa of the upper arm and the transistors Xa, Ya, and Za of the lower arm of the first inverter circuit 4 on the basis of the position detecting signals so as to rotate the first brushless motor 3, respectively.<br>
The microcomputer 7 outputs a chopping signal shown in (j) in Fig. 12 to the chopping circuit 10. The chopping circuit 10 chops a power source of the upper arm drive circuit 8 on the basis of the inputted chopping signal in order to chop as desired an output signal of, for example, the upper arm drive circuit 8 on the basis of the input chopping signal.<br>
Thus, the PW! signals Uai , Va| , and Wal in__ which the ON por¬tions of input drive signals shown in (k) to (m) in Fig. 12 were chopped are outputted from the upper arm drive circuit 8 to the transistors Ua, Va, and Wa of the upper arm of the inverter circuit 4. Signals Xa|, Yai, and Zal shown in (n) to<br><br>
(p) in Fig. 12 are outputted from the lower arm drive circuit 9 to the transistors Xa, Ya, and Za of a lower arm of the inverter circuit 4 on the basis of the input drive signals.<br>
The transistors Ua, Va, Wa, Xa, Ya, and Za of the upper and lower arms of the first inverter circuit 4 are turned on as desired by output signals of the upper arm drive circuit 8 and lower arm drive circuit 9. The connections between the positive and negative terminals of the inverter circuit 4 and the 3-phase windings al, bl, and cl of the first brushless motor 3 are switched. Thus, the DC voltage from the converter circuit 2 is converted to the AC voltage and is applied to the 3-phase windings al, bl, and cl of the first brushless motor 3. At the same time, the transistors Ua, Va, and Wa of the upper arm are choppingly driven by the output signal of the upper arm drive circuit 8 when they are turned on. There¬fore, the chopped AC voltages shown in (q) to (s) in Fig. 12 are applied to the 3-phase windings al, bl, and cl of the first brushless motor 3.     '<br>
In the microcomputer 7, the on/off ratio of the chopping<br>
signal which is supplied to the chopping circuit 10 is made<br>
variable in order to set the rotational speed of the first<br>
brushless motor 3 to a predetermined rotational speed. The<br>
on/off ratio of the chopping of AC voltages which are applied<br>
to the 3-phase windings al, bl, and cl of the first brushless<br>
motor 3 is made variable, . thereby varying the applied vol¬<br>
tages and cbhtrolling the rotation of the first brushless<br>
motor 3. .	       <br>
On the other hand, in the switching power circuit 11, the commercial AC power 1 is conyertied to the DC power by a rec¬tifying circuit 11a and a smoothing capacitor lib and a pre¬determined DC voltage is genexaied. The DC voltage is swit-ched and converted to the variable DC voltage by a trans-£onBft£v.^lc,::the trani^stcxi::ilil, a diode lie, and a smoothing<br><br>
second inverter circuit 13 comprising the six transistors Ub, Vb, Wb, Xb, Yb, and Zb.<br>
The second brushless motor 12 has therein the position detec¬ting sensor (Hall element) 12a. The Hall element 12a detects the position of a rotor of the second brushless motor 12 and generates position detecting signals shown in (a) to (c) in<br>
Fig. 13.<br>
The brushless motor control circuit 14 which receives the position detecting signals from the Hall element 12a is con¬structed by, for example, an exclusiveuse IC for brushless motor control and the like. The brushless motor control cir¬cuit 14 outputs drivesignals Ubl, Vbl, Wbl, Xbl, Ybl, and Zbl shown in (d) to (i) in Fig. 13 to the transistors Ub, Vb, Wb, Xb, Yb, and Zb of the second inverter circuit 13 on the basis of the inputted position detecting signals so as to rotate the second brushless motor 12.<br>
The transistors of the second inverter circuit 13 are rurned on as desired by those drive signals. The variable DC voltage from the switching power circuit 11 which is inputted to the inverter circuit 13 is converted to the C voltages shown in (j) to (2) in Fig. 13 and applied to 3-phase windings a2, b2, and c2 of the second brushless motor 12.<br>
Furthel", the microcomputer 7 generates a rotational. speed command signal  for the second brushless motor 12.  The brushless motor control circuit 14 which receives the rota--tional speed command signal generates. a switching signal switching control the transistor 11d of the switching power .circuit 11 shows in (m) in Fig. 13)],. The flashing motor control circuit 14 varies the on/off ratio for  above swit¬ching signal on the basis of the ingured  rotational speed command signal and varies the PC voltage that is generated by the switching power circuit 11. The rasied DC voltage is converted to the verticle AC voltage by the inverter circuit<br><br>
13 and applied to the 3-phase windings a2, b2, and c2 of the second brushless motor 12. Since the AC voltage which is applied to the 3-phase windings a2, b2, and c2 is made varia¬ble, the second brushless motor 12 is variable-speed con¬trolled.<br>
In such a conventional control method of the air conditioner as mentioned above, however, three control means such as converter control circuit 5, microcomputer 7, and brushless motor control circuit 14 are necessary in order to improve the input power factor, to control the converter circuit 2 for reducing the harmonics current, and to control the rota¬tions of the motors (first and second brushless motors 3 and 12) to drive the compressor and blower which are necessary for the air conditioner. In order to drive the second brushless motor 12, the switching power circuit 11 for vary¬ing the DC voltage and outputting is needed. Further, the control circuit and the power supply circuit of the air con¬ditioner are complicated. The number of parts is large. The reliability is deteriorated. Such three control means become a factor of an increase iin costs and size of the air condi¬tioner.<br>
In the rotation control oti the second brushless motor 12, the on/off ratio of' the switching signal is determined by only the rotational speed command Signal from the microcomputer 7. The value of the DC voltage that is outputted from the swit¬ching power circuit 11-is decided. Therefore, the rotational speed of the second brushless motor 12 fluctuates in associa¬tion with a fluctuation of the load. The actual rotational^ speed doesn't coincide with the rotational speed decided by the rotational speed command signal. Namely, there is a pro blem such that the second brushless motor 12 doesn V' Rotate in accordance with the rotational speed command signal.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide a control method and apparatus of an air conditioner, in which a converter, a compressor, and a blower of the air conditioner can be con¬trolled by a single microcomputer of the air conditioner.<br>
k control apparatus according to the invention comprises: converter means for converting an AC power to DC powsr and for converting an input AC current waveform to a sine wave of the same phase as that of an input voltage by at least swit¬ching means; a plurality of motors for driving a compressor and a blower; a plurality of inverters for converting the converted DC power to the AC power and for supplying it to the motors; and a microcomputer for controlling at least the compressor and blower of the air conditioner, wherein the control apparatus further comprises: the plurality of in¬verters which are connected in parallel and receive an output DC power from the converted; converter control means for outputting a control signal to control the switching means in accordance with at least the input AC current from the micro¬computer and the output DC voltage of the converter; and inverter control means for outputting a control signal to control the plurality of inverters. "At least" is stated before the phrase "switching means" for the reason that in. the present invention, the microcomputer outputs control signals for controlling the switching means (IGBT), and also in the prior art, the converter bontrol circuit outputs con¬trol signals for controlling the switching means (IGBT) so that the input AC current from the AC power has a sine wave, of the same phase as that of the; input AC voltage.       /<br>
With such a construction, the microcomputer execut in put/output operations from/to input/output circuits which are necessary for the air- conditionier, thereby. controlling the air conditioner. At the same time, the microcomposer genera¬tes PWM signal to turn OH-off the switching<br><br>
converter in a manner such that the input alternating current ' from the commercially available AC power is set to a sine wave having the same phase as that of the input AC voltage and the input power factor from the commercially available AC power is improved.<br>
Further, simultaneously with the above operation, the micro¬computer also generates the PVJM signal for on/off controlling the switching means of each inverter in order to inverter control each of the motors (brushless motors or induction motors) to drive the compressor and blower which are necessa¬ry for the air conditioner.<br>
Therefore, the control of the air conditioner, the control of the switching means of the converter, and the inverter con¬trol of the motors for the compressor and blower which are necessary for the air conditioner are executed by the micro¬computer as single control means.<br>
Since the output DC voltage of the converter is applied to<br>
each motor, each motor is driven by the single power circuit.<br>
Thus, the number of parts can be reduced the reliability can<br>
be improved, and the costs and size of the air conditioner<br>
	can be reduced.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
A control method and an apparatus of an air conditioner ac¬cording to the invention will now be described in detail with reference to the drawings. In the diagrams, the same and corresponding portions as those in Fig. 10 are designated by the same reference numerals and their overlapped descriptions are omitted.<br>
In Fig. 1, a control apparatus 32 of the air conditioner comprises: a current sensor 20 and a current detecting cir¬cuit 21 for detecting an input alternating current of the converter circuit 2; a voltage detecting circuit 22 to detect the output DC voltage of the converter circuit 2; a first position detecting circuit 23 having the same construction as that of the position detecting circuit 6 shown in Fig. 10, for outputting position detecting signals of the rotor of the brushless motor 3 to drive a compressor 33; a second position detecting circuit 24 for outputting position detecting si¬gnals of the rotor of the brushless motor 12 to drive a blo¬wer 34; and a microcomputer 25 for performing input/output operations v/hich are necessary to control the air conditio¬ner, for inputting a current detecting signal from the cur¬rent detecting circuit 21, a voltage detecting signal from the voltage detecting circuit 22, the position detecting signals from the fi-rst position detecting circuit 23, and the position detecting signals from th^ second position detecting circu£t"'24, for turning'on br off las desired the IGBT (tran¬sistor) 2a included in the converter circuit 2 for outputting a cont,rol signal [an inverter contirol signal (PWM signal)] in which the on ratio is varied, and for outputting: control signals (including the PWM signal); for respectively control¬ling the first and second inverter! circuits 4 and 13 in addi¬tion to the functions (function to;output the PWM signal, and the like) of the microcomputer 7 s{hown in Fig. 10; apparatus '32 further comprises first and second driving circuits 26 and 27 for respectively driving the plurality of transistors of<br><br>
the first and second inverter circuits 4. and 13 by the con¬trol signals from the microcomputer 25, and a third-driving circuit 23 to turn on/off the IGBT 2a by the PWM signal from the microcomputer 25-<br>
The operation of the control apparatus 32 of the air condi¬tioner will now be described. The microcomputer 25 controls an outdoor apparatus and generates the PWM signal for swit¬ching as desired the IGBT 2a of the converter circuit 2 to the third driving circuit 28 in accordance with the detecting signals from the current detecting circuit 21 and voltage detecting circuit 22. The microcomputer 25 also inputs the position detecting signals of the rotor of the first brushless motor 3 for the compressor 33 from the first posi¬tion detecting circuit 23 and generates control signals for controlling the six transistors Ua, Va, Wa, Xa, Ya, and 2a of the first inverter circuit 4. At the same time, the microcom¬puter 25 inputs the position detecting signals of the rotor of the second brushless motor 12 for the blower 34 from the second position detecting circuit 24 and generates control signals for controlling the six transistors Ub, Vb, Gb, Xb, Yb, and 2b of the second inverter circuit 13.<br>
The current detecting circuit 21 comprises, for example, a rectifying diode and a resistor circuit and converts the input alternating current waveform detected by the current sensor 20 to a level (voltage value) which can be inputted to the microcomputer 25.<br>
The voltage detecting circuit 22 comprises, for example: a voltage dividing resistor circuit for dropping the output DC voltage of the converter circuit 2; and a photocoupler cir¬cuit for insulating the voltage dropped analog value and converting it to digital values (H, L} and supplying them to the microcomputer 25. The voltage dividing ratio of the vol¬tage dividing resistor circuit of the voltage detecting cir¬cuit 22 is set in a manner such that when the output DC vol-<br><br>
tage of the converter circuit 2 is equal to or less than a ^redetermined value, [for-example,-300 V shown in (a) in-'Fig, 2] or less, the output of the photocoupler circuit is set to the H level, and, when the output DC voltage exceeds the predetermined value, the output of the photocoupler circuit is set to the L level. Thus, the voltage detecting signal from the voltage detecting circuit 22 is set to the H or L level. The H or L level signal is supplied to the microcompu¬ter 25.<br>
The voltage detecting circuit 22 can also output an analog value according to the difference between the output DC vol¬tage of the converter circuit 2 and a predetermined value.In this case, it is sufficient that the analog signal from the voltage detecting circuit 22 is inputted to an A/D conversion input port of the nicrocomputer 25.<br>
A control method of the converter circuit 2 used in the con¬trol apparatus 3 2 of the air conditioner will now be des¬cribed with reference to a timing chart of^ Fig. 2.<br>
First, the microconputer 25 calculates a current command ISn<br>
shown in (c) in Fig. 2 on rhe basis of data [IHn shown in (b)<br>
in Fig. 2; n is an integer] which has previously been storsd<br>
in an internal memcry, and of the detecting signal (H or L<br>
level) of the out'put DC voltage of the converter circuit 2<br>
which was inputted." the memory data IMn is a sine wave da-a<br>
(fundamental data) of the half period of the input alterna¬<br>
ting current.	/<br>
As a calculating method of the current command ISn, the tage detecting signal from the voltage detecting circuit is detected every predetermined: time [for instance zero-cross point of the input AC waveform shown in (d) Fig 2 and, when it is at the H level (300 V or less)/ predetermined mined ratio of the memory data is added to the memory data IMn .thereby incresenting the current compound<br><br>
until the voltage detecting signal is set to the L level (exceeding 300 V), the predetetmined ratio of the memory data is added to the memory data IMn, thereby increasing the cur¬rent command ISn. Then, when the voltage detecting signal changes to the L level (exceeding 300 V), the predetermined ratio of the memory data is subtracted from the memory data IMn, thereby decrementing the current command ISn. Until the voltage detecting signal is again set to the H level (300 V or less), the predetermined ratio of the memory data is con¬tinued to be subtracted, thereby decreasing the current com¬mand ISn.<br>
On the basis of the current command ISn calculated in this manner, the IGBT 2a of the converter circuit 2 is turned on or off as desired, thereby setting the output DC voltage of the converter circuit 2 to the predetermined value (300 V).<br>
The current detecting circuit 21 detects the input alterna¬ting current and supplies the current detecting signal to the microcomputer 25. The microcomputer 25 detects a current value IRn shown in (e) in Fig. 2 by the current detecting signal at times tn (tO to t9) of every predetermined time T from a. zero-cross point (tO). The zero-cross point (tO) is detected by a detecting signal from a zero-cross detecting circuit which is used for judgment of the frequency of the input alternating current or the ;like as one of the existing input/output circuits of the outdoor apparatus.<br>
The current command ISn [shown in (c) in Fig. 2) at time tn is subsequently compared with the detecting current IRn [shown in (e) in Fig. 2)]. when ISn &gt; IRn, the ON time Dn of the PWM signal to control the IGBT 2a of the converter cir¬cuit 2 is increased by only a predetermined value. When ISn

Thus, the input alternating current from the commercial ■ AC power 1 can be controlled to the sine wave having the same-phase as that of the input AC voltage as shown in (d) in Fig-2. And in this instance, as already has been described above, also the. output DC voltage of the converter circuit 2 is controlled to the predetermined value.<br>
On"the other hand, as will be obviously understood from Fig.<br>
1,	the first and second inverter circuits 4 and 13 are con¬<br>
nected in parallel with the output of the converter circuit<br>
2.	The first inverter circuit 4 drives the first brushless<br>
motor 3 for the compressor 33. The second inverter circuit 13<br>
drives the second brushless motor 12 for the blower 34. The<br>
first and second brushless motors 3 and 12 are 3-phase motors<br>
and are controlled by the single microcomputer 25 which con¬<br>
trols both the outdoor apparatus and the IGBT 2a of the con¬<br>
verter circuit 2.<br>
The second position detecting ciric^uit 24 comprises, for ex¬ample, comparator means and amplifier means; it inputs si- -qnals from three Hall elements 12a provided in the second brushless motor 12 and supplies the position detecting si¬gnals of the rotor of the second brushless motor 12 to the microcomputer 25,<br>
The second inverter circuit 13 is constructed by: an upper arm comprising the three transistors Ufa, Vfa, and Wb for swit¬ching the connections between a positive terminal of the converter circuit 2 and the 3-phase windings a2, b2, and c2 of the second brushless motor 12; and a lower arm comprising the three transistors Xb, Yb, and -Zb for switching the con¬nections between the 3-phase windings a2, b2, and c2 and a negative terminal of the converter circuit 2.<br>
In Fig. 1, the first driving circiit 26 has a construction<br>
such that the upper arm. drive circuit 8 and lower arm drive<br>
circuit a shown in fig 10 are unified.  The second driving<br><br>
circuit 27 has a construction similar to that of the driving circuit 26.<br>
A control method will now be described with reference to a timing chart of Fig. 3. First, it is assumed that the micro¬computer 25 controls the compressor 33 and blower 34 of the outdoor apparatus in accordance with commands or the like from a control apparatus of an indoor apparatus.<br>
The signals (shown in (a) to (c) in Fig, 3] from the Hall elements 12a in the second brushless motor 12 are supplied to the second position detecting circuit 24. The second position detecting circuit 24 outputs position detecting signals shown in (d) to (f) in Fig. 3 to the microcomputer 25.<br>
The microcomputer 25 turns on as desired the transistors Ub, Vb/ Wb, Xb, Yb, and Zb of the second inverter circuit 13 on the basis of the input position detecting signals so as to rotate the second tJrushless motor 12, switches the connec¬tions between the positive and negative terminals of the converter circuit 2 and the 3-phase windings a2, b2, and c2 of the second brushless motor 12, converts the DC voltages from the converter circuit 2 to the AC voltages, applies the AC voltages to the 3-phase windings a2, b2, and c2, and gene¬rates control signals U2, V2, W2, X2, Y2, and Z2 to rotate the second brushless motor 12.<br>
In this instance, the microcomputer 25 sets the ON porticns of the control signals for turning on as desired the transi¬stors Ub, Vb, and Wb of at least one of the upper and lower arms, for instance, the upper arm of the second inverter circuit 13 among the generated control signals to chopping signals of a predetermined on/off ratio for turning on/off the transistors Ub, Vb, and wb of the upper arm by a frequen¬cy higher than the frequency of the control signals in the microcomputer 25. Thus, the control signals U2, V2, and W2 [shown in (g) to (i) in Fig. 3] using the ON portions as<br><br>
chopping signals, and-the other control signals X2, Y2, and Z2 [shown in (j) to   in Fig. 3] are generated from the ^ microcomputer 25, The" generated control signals 112,' V2,'  W2 ' X2, "^2, and Z2 are supplied to the second inverter circuit 13 through the second driving circuit 27. The transistors Ub, vb, VJb, Xb, Yb, and Zb of the second inverter circuit 13 are turned on as desired. At the time when the transistors Ub Vb, and Wb of the upper arm are principally OK, they are in fact turned on/off by the chopping signals of the control signals.<br>
The DC voltages from the converter circuit 2 are converted to the AC voltages and are chopped.The AC voltages are set to predetermined voltages.AC voltages shown in (m) to (o) in Fig. 3 are applied to the 3-phase windings a2, b2, and c2 of the second brushless motor 12, so that the second brushless motor 12 is rotation-controlled.<br>
With respect to the first brushless motor 3 as well, the rotation is controlled by a method similar to that mentioned above by the microcomputer 25. The microcomputer 25 inputs the position detecting signals which are outputted from the first position detecting circuit 23 and generates control signals Ul, VI, Wl, XI, Yl, and Zl to turn on as desired the transistors Ua, Va, Wa, Xa, Ya, and' Za of the first inverter circuit 4 on the basis of the position detecting signals so as to rotate the first brushless motor 3.<br>
Among the control signals Ul, VI, Wl, Xl, Yl, and Zl, the ON portions of the control signals 'ui, VI, and Wl to turn on as desired the transistors Ua, Va,; and Wa, of at least one of the upper arm and lower arm, for example, the upper arm of the first inverter circuit 4 are set to be chopping signals of a predetermined on/off ratio to turn on/off the transi¬stors Ua, Va, and Wa bya frequency higher than the frequency of the control signals in the microcomputer 25- The microcom¬puter. 25 generates thecontrol signals Ul. VI. wi. xi. VT_<br><br>
and Zl -including the drive signals serving as chopping si¬gnals.<br>
The generated control signals Ul, VI, Wl, XI, Yl, and Zl are supplied to the first inverter circuit 4 through the first driving circuit 26. The transistors Ua, Va, wa, Xa, Ya, and Za of the first inverter circuit 4 are turned on as desired and, at the same time, the transistors Ua, Va, and Wa are chopped at the time of turn-on thereof. Thus, the DC voltage from the converter circuit 2 is converted to the AC voltages and the chopped AC voltages are applied to the 3-phase win¬dings al, bl, and cl of the first brushless motor 3, thereby rotation-controlling the first brushless motor 3.<br>
The control signals Ul, VI, Wl, XI, Yl, and Zl are the same as the signals Ual, Val, Wal, Xal, Yal, and Zal shown in Fig. 12.<br>
The rotation control in the second brushless motor 12 will now be described in detail. The microcomputer 25 calculates the rotational speed of the second brushless motor 12 on the basis of the position detecting signals [shown-in (d) to (f) in Fig. 3] inputted through an input port. As a calculating method of the rotational speed, for instance, a time interval between leading edges or trailing edges of the three inputted position detecting, signals {shown in (d) to (f) in Fig. 3] is measured thereby calculating the rotational speed.<br>
The above calculated rotational speed is compared with a predetermined rotational speed of the second brushless motor 12. When the calculated rotationa.l speed is smaller than the predetermined rotational speed, the rotational speed of the second brushless motor 12 is set to the predetermined rota¬tional speed. For this purpose, the ON times of the chopping signals of the drive signals U2, V2, and W2 of the transi¬stors ub, Vb, and Wb of the upper arm constructing the second inverter circuit 1_3 are_.increased (namely. the OFF times are<br><br>
decreased; on/off ratio is varied). Thus, the resulting AC voltages which are applied to the 3-phase windings a2/ b2,-and c2 o£ the second brushless motor 12 are raised and the rotational speed of the second brushless motor 12 is increa¬sed.<br>
When the calculated rotational speed is larger than the pre¬determined rotational speed, in order to set the rotational speed of the second brushless motor 12 to the predetermined rotational speed, the ON times of the chopping signals of the control signals U2, V2, and W2 of the transistors Ub, Vb, and Wb of the upper arm are decreased (namely, OFF times are increased; on/off ratio is varied). Thus, the resulting AC voltages which are applied to the 3-phase windings a2, b2, and c2 of the second brushless motor 12 are dropped and the rotational speed of the second brushless motor 12 is reduced.<br>
By repeating the above operations, the rotational speed of the second brushless motor 12 is variably controlled and the motor 12 is constantly rotated and controlled at a prede¬termined rotational speed.<br>
With respect to the first brushless motor 3 as well, a rota¬<br>
tion control similar to the ro,tation control of the second<br>
brushless motor 12 is executed. Therefore, the first and<br>
second brushless motors 3 and 12 are constantly rotated and<br>
controlled - at predetermined respective rotational speeds by<br>
the microcomputer.	■<br>
Fig. 4 is a schematic circuit diagram of the control appare-tus :i2 of the air conditioner showing a modified embodiment of the invention. In-t^e diagram, the same and corresponding portions as those in Fig. 1 are'designated by the sarae refe¬rence numerals and their overlapped descriptions are omitted.<br><br><br>
verter Circuit 2 and the second brushless motor 12 for the blower 34 are similar to those shown in the foregoing embodi¬ment .<br>
In Fig. 4, the control apparatus of the air conditioner has a microcomputer 31 which has the functions of the microcompu¬ter 25 shown in Fig. 1 and controls the rotation of the in¬duction motor 30 for the compressor 33.<br>
First, when the rotation of the induction motor 30 is con¬trolled, the microcomputer 31 compares a modulation wave shown in (a) in Fig. 5 with fundamental waves U, V, and W every half period Tf4 and obtains intersection points between the modulation wave and the fundamental waves U, V, and w, respectively. On the basis of the intersection points obtai¬ned, times Tu4, Tv4, and Tw4 up to the intersection points shown in (a) in Fig. 5 are obtained. On the basis of the times Tu4, Tv4, and Tw4 obtained, control signals (PWM si¬gnals) U4, X4, V4, Y4, W4, and 24 (X4, Y4, and Z4 are the signals obtained by inverting U4, V4, and W4) are generated and outputted [shown in (b) to (g) in Fig. 5].<br>
The first driving circuit 26 which received the first PWM signals U4, X4, V4, Y4, W4, and Z4 from the microcomputer 31 turns on/off the six transistors Ua,' Xa, Va, Ya, Wa, and Za constructing the first inverter circuit 4 on the basis of the .. drive signals U4, X4, V4, Y4, W4, and 24. As mentioned above, since the transistors Ua, Xa, Va, ,Ya, Ma, and Za of the first inverter circuit 4 are cn/off controlled, the output DC vol¬tage from the converter circuit 2 is converted to the 3-phase alternating currents. The 3-phase alternating currents are supplied to the 3-phase windings a3, b3, and c3 of the induc¬tion motor 30 [shown in (h) in Fig. 5], so that the induction motor 30 is rotated. _<br>
In this instance, to.set the induction motor 30 to a prede¬termined rotational speed the microcomputer 31 sets the<br><br>
fundamental waves u, V, and W to predetermined amplitudes and predetermined f requencies in accordance with the predetermin¬ed rotational speed of the induction motor 30, thereby vary¬ing the intersection points between the modulation wave and the fundamental waves U, V, and W and varying Tu4, Tv4, and Tw4 mentioned above.Thus, pulse widths (on/off timings) of the control signals (PWM signals) U4, X4, V4, Y4, W4, and Z4 are varied by such variation and are outputted from the mi¬crocomputer 31. The 3-phase alternating currents to be supp¬lied from the first inverter circuit 4 to the induction motor 30 are subsequently set to predetermined voltages and prede¬termined frequencies. The induction motor 30 is rotated at a predetermined rotational speed.<br>
The microcomputer which is used in the control apparatus of the invention will now be specifically explained. The whole construction of the first control apparatus is shown in Fig. 1.<br>
Fig. 6 is a specific constructional block diagram of signal generating means in the microcomputer 25 shown m Fig. 1. In Fig. 6, the microcomputer 25 has first to thitd signal gene¬rating means 40, 41, and 42.<br>
The third signal generating means 42 generates the third PWM signal to control the IGBT 2a of the converter circuit 2. The first and second signal generating means 40 and 41 respecti¬vely generate the first and second control signals to control the first and second inverter circuits 4 and 13 - The first and second control signals and the third PWM signal are out<br>
putted from the microcomputer 25i.<br>

I<br>
The third signal generating means 42 will now be described. The third signal generating means 42 generates the third pwM signal shown in (a) in Fig. 7. in this instance, the micro¬computer 25 sets a period Tf3 and an on  time Ton3 [shown in (a).Jin Fig. 7] of the third PWM signal into an internal memo-<br><br>
ry 42a and resets a timer counter 42b and starts. At the sane time, the microcomputer 25 set's the third PWM signal that is outputted from comparator means 42c to the H level (on).<br>
The comparator means 42c compares a count value of the timer counter 42b with Ton3 in the memory 42a.When they coincide, an output signal (third PWM signal) of the comparator means 42 ds set to the L level (off).<br>
After that, when Tf3 in the memory 42a coincides with the count value of the timer counter 42b, the timer counter 42b is reset and is restarted. At the same time, the third PWM signal that is outputted from the comparator means 42c is set to the H level (on). For such a period of time, the value of Ton3 in the memory 42a is rewritten to the ON time data of the next pulse by the microcomputer 25, so that the pulse width of the third PWM signal which is outputted changes.<br>
By repeating the foregoing processes, the third PWM signal shown in (a) in Fig. 7 is generated and is outputted from the microcomputer 25.<br>
First and second control signal generating means 40e and 41e<br>
of the first and .second signal generating means 40 and 41<br>
receive the first and second ^position detecting signals<br>
[shown in (b) to (d) in Fig. 7:] of the first and second<br>
brushless motors 3 and 12, respectively. On the basis of the<br>
position detecting signals, the ioontrol signals Ul, VI, Wl,<br>
XI, Yl, and Zl and control signal? U2, V2, W2, X2, Y2, and Z2<br>
shown in (e) to (j) in Fiq. 7 for turning on as desired the<br>
transistors Ua, Va, Wa, Xa, Ya, 2a, Ub, Vb, Wb, Xb, Yb, and<br>
Zb of the first and second inverters 4 and 13 are generated<br>
so as to rotate the first and second brushless motors 3 and<br>
12, respectively.	I<br><br><br>
and a second PWM reference signal [shown in (k) in Fig. 7] of predetermined on/off ratios are generated at frequencies ■ higher than the frequency of each of the generated control signals, respectively. In this instance, periods Tfl and Tf2 [shown in (k) in Fig. 7J of the first and second PWM referen¬ce signals are set into the memories 40a and 4la. Further, predetermined ON times Tonl and Ton2 of the first and second PWM reference signals are set into the memories 40a and 41a, respectively. The timer counters 40b and 41b are reset and started and, at the same time, the first and second PWM refe¬rence signals are set to the H level (on).<br>
In the comparator means 40c and 41c, count values of the timer counters 40b and 41b are compared with the values of the ON times Tonl and Ton2 of the first and second PWM refe¬rence signals in the memories 40a and 41a, respectively. When they coincide, the corresponding PWM reference signal is set to the L level (off).<br>
I<br>
I   :■<br>
After that, count values of the timer counters 40b and 41b are compared with values of the periods Tfl and TI2 of the first and second PWM reference signals in the-memories 40a and 41a, respectively. When they coincide, the timer counters 40b and 41b are reset and restarted. Simultaneously with it, the first and second PWM reference signals are set to the H level (on). After that, by repeating processes similar to those mentioned above, the first and second pWM reference sTgnals "are generating shown in (k) in Fig. 7].<br>
First and second PWM signal generating means 40d and	41d<br>
input the generated control signals and also input the gene¬<br>
rated first and second PWM reference signals. Among the	in¬<br>
putted control signals, the ON portions of the control	si¬<br>
gnals Ul, VI, Wl, U2, V2, and W2 to turn on as desired	the<br>
transistors Ua,Va,Wa,Ub,Vb,and wb of at least one of	the<br>
upper and lower arms, in the example, tire upper arm of	the<br>
first and second inverter circuits 4 and 13 are set to	the<br><br>
PWM signals by the first and second PWM reference signals.<br>
In the first and second PWM signal generating means 40d and 41d, the ANDs or ORs between the control signals Ul, VI, Wl, U2, V2, and W2 as PWM signals and the first and second PWM reference signals, in the example, the ANDs are obtained. In case of the second PWM signal generating means 4ld, as shown in,(e) to (n) in Fig. 7, the second control signals U2, V2, and W2 are set to the second PWM reference signal [shown in (k) in Fig. 7] only when the output signals are at the H level.<br>
Thus, the ON portions of the control signals of the upper<br>
arms of the first and second inverter circuits 4 and 13 are<br>
set to the first and second PWM reference signals, respecti-<br>
■ vely. The first and second PWM signals Ul, Vl, and Wl and U2,<br>
V2, and W2 shown in (2) to (n) in Fig. 7 in which the ON<br>
portions are set to the first and second PWH reference si¬<br>
gnals and the other first and second control signals XI, Yl,<br>
and 21 and X2, Y2, and 22 shown in (o) to (q) in Fig. 7 are<br>
generated by the first and second PWH signal generating means<br>
40d and 41d, respectively. The twelve first and se^cond output<br>
control signals generated are outputted from the microcompu¬<br>
ter 25.	'<br>
The first and second control signal generating means 40e and 41e generate the control signals to the first and second PWM signal generating neans 40d and 41d on the basis of the first and second position detecting signals, respectively.<br>
The microcomputer 2=-varies as desired the ON times Tonl and Ton2 of the first and second pWM reference signals which are set into the memories 40a and 4i,a, thereby constantly rota¬tion-controlling the first and second brushless motors 3 and 12 at predeterroined rotational speeds respectively.<br>
In the above embodiment, the periods Tfl, Tf2, and Tf3 of the <br><br>
first to third PWM signals have individually been set. Howe¬ver, two or three of those periods can be-■also-set~to a com mon period. In this case, the memories, timer counters, and comparator means can be also commonly constructed.<br>
Fig. 8 shows an example in the case where the above three periods are commonly set. As will be obviously understood from Fig. 8, first, second, and third signal generating means 50 of the microcomputer 25 comprise: a memory 50a for setting the period Tf of the PWM signal, ON time Tonl of the first PWM signal, ON time Ton2 of the second PWM signal, and ON time Ton3 of the third PWM signal; a timer counter 50b; com¬parator means 50c; first and second PWM signal generating means 50d and 50e; and first and second control signal gene¬rating means 50f and 50g.<br>
That is, the memory 50a corresponds to the memory shown in Fig. 6- The timer counter 50b corresponds to the timer coun¬ter shown in Fig. 6. The comparator means 50c corresponds to the comparator means shown in Fig. 6. The first and second PWM signal generating means 50d and 50e correspond to the first and second PWM signal generating means shown in Fig. 6. The first and second control signal generating means 50f and 50g correspond to the first and second control signal genera¬ting means shown in.Fig. 6. Since the operations of the si¬gnal generating means in such a construction are also similar - to -those mentioned above their descriptions are omitted here.<br>
r<br>
Fig. 9 is a schematic block diagram showing a construction of the signal generating means in the microcomputer 31 shown in Fig. 4. In the example a first signal generating means 60 is provided to control the induction motor 30 for the compressor "33 shown in Fig. 4. The periods of the second and third pwM signals are set to the same peTiod. Second and third signal generating means 61 for generating the second and third PWM viginals are unified  The second and third signal generating<br><br>
means 61 have a construction similar to that of the first second, and third signal generating means shown in Fig.s8-<br>
The whole construction of this second control apparatus of the air conditioner is shown in the schematic block diagram of Fig. 4. The operations are shown in the timing charts of Fig. 5.<br>
r<br>
The first signal generating means 60 of the microcomputer 31 will be first described. In the half period Tf4 of the modu¬lation wave, intersection points between the modulation wave and the fundamental waves U, V, and W are obtained [refer to (a) in Fig. 5] and the times Tu4, Tv4, and Tw4 up to the intersection points are obtained [refer to (b), (d), and (f) in Fig. 5].<br>
The microcomputer 31 sets the half period Tf4 of the modula¬tion value into a memory 60a and also sets the obtained values Tu4, Tv4, and Tw4 into the memory 60a.<br>
A timer counter 60b is reset and started.At the same time, three signals U4, V4, and W4 [refer to (b), (d), an~d (f) in Fig. 5] which are outputted from, a comparator means 60c are set to the L level.<br>
The comparator means 60c compares a count value of the timer counter 60b v/ith the values Tu4,-Tv4, and Tw4 in the memory 603, respectively. When they coincide, each output signal is inverted. When the count value of.the timer counter 60b coin¬cides with the value in the memory 60a as a half period Tf4 of the modulation wave, the comparator means 60c resets the timer counter 60b. For such a period of time, the intersec¬tion points between the modulation wave in the next half period of the modulation wave and the fundeunental waves u, V, and w are obtained in .the microcomputer 31. From the inter¬section points, the new values Tu4/ Tv4, and Tw4 are obtained<br>
- mnA   KVA  JI<ia- n eel- i nt-n the fnemorv: fioa simultaneously with></ia-><br>
reset of the timer counter 60b. The timer counter 60b is restarted.        - ■<br>
By repeating the above processes, the PWM signals U4, V4, and W4 shown in Fig. 5 are outputted from the comparator means 60c.<br>
The above three PWl signals U4, V4, and W4 are respectively<br>
inverted by inversion means 60d, 60e, and 60f and become the<br>
PWM signals X4, Y4, and Z4 shown in (c), (e), and (g) in Fig.<br>
5. The inverted signals X4, Y4, and Z4 and non-inversion<br>
signals U4, V4, and W4 are inputted to dead time generating<br>
means 50g. The dead time generating means 60g is delay means.<br>
In order to prevent that the two transistors (Ua and Xa; Va<br>
and Ya; Wa and Za) of the same phase of the first inverter<br>
circuit 4 are simultaneously turned on and the power supply<br>
is shortcircuited, for instance, the leading edges of the<br>
inputted signals U4, V4, W4, X4, Y4, and Z4 are delayed by a<br>
predetermined time, thereby ^preventing that the two transi¬<br>
stors of the same phase are simultaneously set to the H level<br>
(on).	<br>
As mentioned above, six PWH -signals U4, V4, W4, X4, ¥4, and<br>
Z4 as first control signals are generated from the first<br>
signal generating means 60 and are outputted from the micro¬<br>
computer 31.	1<br>
At the same time, in order to set the induction motor 30 to a predetermined rotational speed, the microcomputer 3 1 va-ries the fundamental waves U, V, and W to predetermined am¬plitudes and predetermined frequencies in accordance with the predetermined rotational speed, thereby varying the intersec¬tion points between the modulation wave and the fundamental waves. Thus, the values Tu4, Tv4., and Tw4 which are set into the memory 60a are varied, the pulse widths (on/off timings) of the six PWM signals are varied and outputted, and the rotational speed of the induction motor 30 is varied. thereby<br><br>
rotating the induction motor at a predetermined rotational speed. The half period-Tf4 of the modulation wave which is set into the memory 60a can be also varied as necessary.<br>
Since the second and third signal generating means 61 have already been described in Fig. 8, the description of the operations are omitted here. In this case, in Fig. 9, the memory 6la corresponds to the memory 50a shown in Fig. 8, the timer counter 61b corresponds to the timer counter 50b shov/n in Fig. 8, the comparator means 61c corresponds to the compa¬rator means 50c shown in Fig. 8, the second PWM signal gene¬rating means 61d corresponds to the second PWM signal genera¬ting means 50e shown in Fig. 8, and the second control signal generating means 61e corresponds to the second control signal generating means 50g shown in Fig. 8.<br><br><br>
