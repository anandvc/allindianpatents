SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR ENGINE SOUND CALIBRATION<br>
FIELD<br>
[0001] The present disclosure relates to calibrating an engine, and<br>
more particularly to calibrating an engine to meet engine sound objectives.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
[0003] A typical diesel engine in a motor vehicle is calibrated to meet<br>
emissions standards, power and torque requirements, and to meet fuel economy<br>
targets. Once those targets are met, the engine is then calibrated to account for<br>
sound radiated from the engine. However, by first calibrating for emissions,<br>
power, torque and fuel economy targets, the engine may have high combustion<br>
pressures and high pressure rise rates within the combustion cylinder. These<br>
pressures and rise rates can act as a dynamic forcing function on the structure of<br>
the diesel engine. This in turn can lead to the diesel engine radiating high noise<br>
levels, possibly exceeding the engine noise objectives. In addition, these high<br>
noise levels can be in excess of typical gasoline powered engine noise levels<br>
and can be aurally displeasing to the operator and passengers within the motor<br>
vehicle.<br>
[0004] Therefore, it is desirable to calibrate diesel engines by<br>
considering engine sound requirements during the calibration process.<br>
1<br><br>
Docket No. GP-309410-PTE-JK<br>
Accordingly, the present invention seeks to provide the art with a method of<br>
calibrating the engine utilizing the combustion noise of the cylinder to meet<br>
engine radiated noise and sound quality objectives.<br>
SUMMARY<br>

relationship between cylinder combustion noise and radiated engine sound.<br>
[0006] In one aspect of the present invention, the system includes the<br>
steps of setting a set of combustion parameters for the engine, detecting a<br>
combustion noise during combustion proximate to the cylinder, detecting an<br>
engine sound radiated from the engine during combustion, adjusting the<br>
combustion parameters and repeating the steps of detecting a combustion noise<br>
and detecting an engine sound, generating a relationship between the detected<br>
combustion noises and the detected engine sounds, determining a combustion<br>
noise level that correlates to a predefined engine sound threshold from the<br>
relationship, adjusting a speed of the engine and a load on the engine and<br>
repeating the previous steps to determine a combustion noise level for each<br>
engine speed and engine load setting and calibrating the engine using the<br>
combustion noise levels.<br>
[0007] In another aspect of the present invention, the system includes<br>
the step of generating a relationship between the combustion noise and the<br>
engine sound includes generating a loss function that relates the combustion<br>
noise to the engine sound.<br>

Docket No. GP-309410-PTE-JK<br>
[0008] In another aspect of the present invention the loss function is a<br>
linear or other relationship between the combustion noise and the engine sound.<br>
[0009] In still another aspect of the present invention the step of<br>
determining a combustion noise level includes entering the engine sound<br>
threshold into the loss function to calculate the combustion noise level.<br>
[0010] In another aspect of the present invention, the system includes<br>
the step of validating the engine calibration to determine the accuracy of the<br>
combustion noise levels.<br>
[0011] In another aspect of the present invention the step of calibrating<br>
the engine includes using engine exhaust emission targets, fuel economy<br>
targets, and engine performance targets with the combustion noise levels.<br>
[0012] In another aspect of the present invention the step of setting the<br>
combustion parameters includes setting at least one of, or a combination of, a<br>
fuel injection timing, exhaust gas recirculation rate, fuel rail pressure, pilot<br>
injection fuel quantity, and number of pilot injections.<br>
[0013] The present invention further provides a system for calibrating<br>
an engine, the engine having a cylinder for combustion of a fuel.<br>
[0014] In one aspect of the present invention, the system includes a<br>
dynamometer for changing a speed of the engine and a load on the engine, an<br>
engine calibration system in communication with the engine for varying a set of<br>
combustion parameters for the engine, and a noise/vibration/harshness system<br>
for detecting a combustion noise proximate to the cylinder of the engine during<br>
combustion and for detecting an engine sound radiated from the engine during<br>

combustion, the system having a controller having a first control logic for<br>
detecting the combustion noise and for detecting the engine sound for each of a<br>
set of the combustion parameters, a second control logic for generating a<br>
relationship between the combustion noise and the engine sound, a third control<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0025] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is<br>
not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses.<br>
5<br><br>
Docket No. GP-309410-PTE-JK<br>
[0026] FIG. 1 illustrates a system 10 for developing a cylinder<br>
combustion noise versus engine sound function for an engine 12 according to the<br>
principles of the present invention. In the particular example provided, the<br>
engine 12 is a combustion diesel engine, however it should be appreciated that<br>
the engine 12 may take various forms and the present invention is not limited to<br>
any one particular type of engine 12. The engine 12 includes an at least one<br>
combustion cylinder (not shown) used for combustion of a fuel. The engine 12 is<br>
in electronic communication with an engine controller 14. The engine controller<br>
14 is an electronic device having a preprogrammed digital computer or<br>
processor, control logic, memory used to store data, and at least one I/O section.<br>
The control logic includes a plurality of logic routines for monitoring,<br>
manipulating, and generating data. The engine controller 14 is operable to set<br>
various combustion parameters for the engine 12. These combustion<br>
parameters include, but are not limited to, fuel injection timing, exhaust gas<br>
recirculation rates, fuel rail pressure, pilot injection fuel quantity, and the number<br>
of pilot injections. The engine controller 14 is further operable to sense the<br>
operating parameters of the engine 12 using a plurality of sensors within the<br>
engine 12.<br>
[0027] The system 10 further includes a dynamometer 16 coupled to<br>
the engine 12. The dynamometer 16 is a device known in the art for adjusting<br>
the speed of the engine and the load on the engine. One of any kind of various<br>
dynamometers may be employed with the present invention.<br>
6<br><br>
Docket No. GP-309410-PTE-JK<br>
[0028] A noise/vibration/harshness system (NVH system) 18 is also<br>
coupled to the engine 12. The NVH system 18 is operable to measure engine<br>
sound, indicated by line 20, and cylinder combustion noise, indicated by line 22.<br>
The engine sound is the engine sound radiated through the air from the engine<br>
12 during combustion of the fuel within the cylinders. The cylinder combustion<br>
noise is the noise level at one of, or a plurality of, the combustion cylinders within<br>
the engine 12 during combustion of the fuel within the cylinders. The NVH<br>
system 18 may be further operable to measure the vibration of the engine 12. In<br>
the preferred embodiment, the cylinder combustion noise is measured using an<br>
AVL combustion noise meter, though various other kinds of sensors may be<br>
employed. The NVH system 18 further includes a controller or other electronic<br>
device having a preprogrammed digital computer or processor, control logic,<br>
memory used to store data, and at least one I/O section. The control logic<br>
includes a plurality of logic routines for monitoring, manipulating, and generating<br>
the cylinder combustion noise and engine sound data.<br>
[0029] The system 10 further includes an engine calibration system 24.<br>
The engine calibration system 24 is in electronic communication with the engine<br>
controller 14. The engine calibration system 24 is operable to vary the<br>
combustion parameters of the engine 12 by communicating with the engine<br>
controller 14.<br>
[0030] With reference now to FIG.'S 2A and 2B and continued<br>
reference to FIG. 1, a method 100 for developing a cylinder combustion noise<br>
versus engine sound function employing the system 10 is illustrated in flowchart<br>
7<br><br>
Docket No. GP-309410-PTE-JK<br>
form. The method 100 begins at step 102 where the engine calibration system<br>
24 communicates with the engine controller 14 to set the combustion parameters<br>
of the engine 12 during combustion of the fuel within the cylinders. The<br>
operating parameters include the fuel pressure within the fuel rail, fuel injection<br>
timing, exhaust gas recirculation rates, pilot injection fuel quantity, and the<br>
number of pilot injections. Various other operating parameters may be included<br>
without departing from the scope of the present invention. Also at step 102, the<br>
dynamometer 16 is used to set an initial speed of the engine 12 and an initial<br>
load on the engine 12.<br>
[0031] At step 104, the NVH system 18 detects the cylinder<br>
combustion noise proximate to the cylinder within the engine 12. The NVH<br>
system 18 records and stores the combustion noise data for the set combustion<br>
parameters and the dynamometer 16 settings.<br>
[0032] At step 106, the NVH system 18 measures the engine sound<br>
radiated through the air from the engine 12. The NVH system 18 records and<br>
stores the engine sound data for the set combustion parameters and the<br>
dynamometer 16 settings.<br>
[0033] At step 108, the engine calibration system 24 adjusts the<br>
combustion parameters of the engine 12 by communicating with the engine<br>
controller 14 in order to vary the cylinder combustion noise and radiated engine<br>
sound. Which of the combustion parameters is varied depends on the<br>
combustion mode used with the engine 12. For example, if the combustion<br>
mode is using a pre-mix charge compression ignition, then the engine calibration<br>
8<br><br>
Docket No. GP-309410-PTE-JK<br>
system 24 varies the fuel injection timing of the main injection, the fuel injection<br>
timing and quantity of the pilot injection, the exhaust gas recirculation rate, and<br>
the fuel rail pressure. If the combustion mode is using a homogeneous charge<br>
compression ignition, then the engine calibration system 24 varies the fuel<br>
injection timing of the main injection, the pilot injection fuel quantity, the number<br>
of pilot injections, the exhaust gas recirculation rate, and the fuel rail pressure.<br>
Additionally, variable geometry turbo may also be adjusted in order to vary the<br>
level of intake air during engine operating conditions. It should be appreciated<br>
that various combinations of combustion parameters may be varied without<br>
departing from the scope of the present invention.<br>
[0034] As noted above, adjusting the combustion parameters in turn<br>
alters the amount of cylinder combustion noise and the amount of engine sound<br>
radiated from the engine 12. The method 100 then repeats steps 104 and 106 at<br>
least one time to record cylinder combustion noise and engine sound for the<br>
adjusted combustion parameters.<br>
[0035] Once steps 104 and 106 have been repeated at least once for a<br>
different set of combustion parameters, a relationship between the measured<br>
cylinder combustion noise data and the measured engine sound data is<br>
generated at step 110. This relationship correlates the measured cylinder<br>
combustion noise to the measured radiated engine sound for the given set of<br>
combustion parameters and dynamometer 16 settings. In the preferred<br>
embodiment, the relationship is a loss function. The loss function is a<br>
mathematical function that describes a linear relationship between the cylinder<br>
9<br><br>
Docket No GP-309410-PTE-JK<br>
combustion noise measured at the cylinders of the engine 12 and the engine<br>
sound radiated from the engine 12. Alternatively, the loss function may describe<br>
a non-linear relationship, depending on the speed and load conditions.<br>
Additionally, a lookup table or chart may be generated and stored within the NVH<br>
system 18 that correlates the measured cylinder combustion noise data with the<br>
measured engine sound data.<br>
[0036] At step 112 an engine sound threshold is selected. The engine<br>
sound threshold is pre-defined and is a target radiated engine sound desirable<br>
for the given engine 12. The engine sound threshold is determined using a<br>
number of factors, including, but not limited to, the application the engine 12 is<br>
intended for (commercial vehicle, passenger vehicle, etc.) as well as the given<br>
engine speed and engine load settings. The engine sound threshold is stored in<br>
memory within the engine calibration system 24 or the NVH system 18.<br>
Additionally, the engine sound threshold may be stored in a lookup table.<br>
[0037] At step 114, a combustion noise level is determined from the<br>
engine sound threshold using the relationship generated at step 110. The<br>
combustion noise level is specific to the given engine speed and engine load<br>
settings. As noted above, the relationship generated at step 110 may take the<br>
form of a loss function or lookup table. Accordingly, the combustion noise levei<br>
may be determined using the loss function generated at step 110 to calculate the<br>
combustion noise level from the engine sound threshold. Alternatively, the<br>
combustion noise level may be determined by using the lookup table generated<br>
at step 110 to look up the combustion noise level corresponding to the engine<br>
10<br><br>
Docket No GP-309410-PTE-JK<br>
sound threshold. For engine threshold levels that do not correspond to the<br>
engine sound data directly measured at step 106, the combustion noise level is<br>
an extrapolation or interpolation from the cylinder combustion noise and engine<br>
sound correlation.<br>
[0038] At step 116, the dynamometer 16 changes the engine speed<br>
and engine load settings from the initial settings provided at step 102.<br>
Alternatively, the engine speed and engine load settings may be adjusted using<br>
vehicle or chassis rolls, or any other available means. The dynamometer 16 may<br>
change the speed of the engine and the load on the engine individually or<br>
simultaneously. The method 100 then repeats steps 104, 106, 108, 110, 112<br>
and 114 at least one time. For each engine speed and engine load setting that is<br>
set at step 116, the method 100 will determine a combustion noise level that<br>
correlates to the pre-defined engine sound thresholds. Preferably, the method<br>
100 will repeat steps 104 - 114 to determine a combustion noise level for a<br>
range of speed settings and a range of load settings.<br>
[0039] Once the method 100 has determined a set of combustion noise<br>
levels for each set of engine speed and engine load settings, the engine 12 is<br>
then calibrated at step 118. The calibration is performed using the combustion<br>
noise levels as accurate estimates of the pre-defined engine sound thresholds.<br>
The calibration process also uses engine exhaust emission targets, fuel economy<br>
targets, and engine performance targets along with the combustion noise levels,<br>
as will be described in further detail below. In the preferred embodiment,<br>
calibration of the engine 12 involves defining an operating range of the engine<br>
11<br><br>
Docket No. GP-309410-PTE-JK<br>
12, defining emission targets, then using the combustion noise level with the<br>
emission targets to optimize for fuel economy.<br>
[0040] At step 120, the calibration settings performed in step 118 are<br>
validated using a testing process. Any inaccuracies or problems may then be<br>
corrected by re-calibrating the engine as needed. In the preferred embodiment,<br>
the validation process involves verifying combustion noise levels and emissions<br>
targets on a steady state chassis roll, testing the transient response of the<br>
combustion noise levels, emissions targets, and performance levels, validating<br>
on an emission cycle, and then adjusting the engine 12 as needed.<br>
[0041] FIG. 3 illustrates an exemplary relationship 200 between<br>
cylinder combustion noise and engine sound generated at step 110 in FIG. 2A.<br>
The relationship 200 is illustrated graphically in a chart 202, wherein the x-axis of<br>
the chart 202 is defined as the measured combustion noise (AVL CN) near the<br>
cylinder of the engine 12 in decibels and the y-axis of the chart 202 is defined as<br>
the measured engine sound (Sound Power in decibels) radiated from the engine<br>
12. The relationship 200 provided is for a set engine speed of 1000 rotations per<br>
minute. Measured cylinder combustion noise and measured engine sound are<br>
plotted on the chart 202 and are indicated by points 204 for each of a set of load<br>
settings. In the particular example provided, load settings of 72 N-m, 108 N-m,<br>
and 215 N-m are used and indicated by separate points. A loss function 206 is<br>
then calculated from these points 204 for each load setting, as seen by the three<br>
separate lines. The loss function 206 is estimated as a linear relationship having<br>
a positive slope, but the loss function 206 is not limited to this linear relationship.<br>
12<br><br>
Docket No. GP-309410-PTE-JK<br>
Engine sound thresholds may be plotted on the relationship 200, as indicated by<br>
points 208, and a combustion noise level determined from the combustion noise<br>
corresponding on the x-axis to the engine sound threshold 208. To enhance or<br>
improve the relationship 200, adjustments that account for acoustic requirements<br>
may be made to individual data points or to the loss function 206.<br>
[0042] FIG. 4 illustrates an exemplary combustion noise level contour<br>
plot 300. The plot 300 plots the combustion noise levels for each engine speed<br>
setting and each engine load setting set at step 116 in FIG. 2A. The x-axis of the<br>
plot 300 is defined as the load settings and the y-axis of the plot 300 is defined<br>
as the engine speed settings in rotations per minute. For each combination of<br>
engine speed and engine load, a combustion noise level may be determined and<br>
included in the plot 300. This plot 300 is useful for assisting in the calibration of<br>
the engine 12 in step 118 in FIG. 2B.<br>
[0043] Turning now to FIG. 5, the step 118 of calibrating the engine<br>
and the step 120 of verification of the calibration is shown in an expanded flow<br>
chart. Calibration of the engine 12 begins as the engine 12 is coupled to the<br>
dynamometer 16. At step 402, an operating range is defined at steady state<br>
conditions wherein the engine speed and engine load are held constant. At<br>
step 404, a steady state emissions target is defined. This steady state emissions<br>
target is defined to meet emission cycle requirements.<br>
[0044] At step 406, steady state calibrations are performed to meet the<br>
combustion noise levels determined at step 114 and to meet the emissions<br>
target. Steady state calibrations are performed at predetermined engine power<br>
13<br><br>
Docket No. GP-309410-PTE-JK<br>
and engine torque amounts. Optimization for fuel economy is also performed on<br>
the engine 12. Alternatively, steps 402 - 406 may be performed during transient<br>
engine conditions wherein engine speed and engine load are continuously varied<br>
to reflect typical driving conditions. At step 408, transient condition verification is<br>
performed for emissions, fuel economy, and noise. During transient condition<br>
verification, engine speed and engine load are continuously varied. Transient<br>
condition verification is conducted in order to identify possible engine operating<br>
conditions where the target combustion noise level is exceeded. The target<br>
combustion noise may be exceeded for various reasons, for example, due to a<br>
response lag in an air handling system. Further adjustments in the calibration<br>
are applied as necessary during step 408.<br>
[0045] Verification of the calibration begins at step 410 when the<br>
assembled vehicle, including the engine 12, is placed on chassis rolls. Then, at<br>
step 412, emissions, combustion noise and fuel economy are verified for the<br>
vehicle and engine 12 on a chassis dynamometer. Any required modifications to<br>
the vehicle and the engine 12 are made at this time. At step 414, transient<br>
response of the combustion noise and the engine output is tested. At step 416,<br>
validation of the emission cycles is performed and any necessary iterations of the<br>
validation process are performed. The validation data determined at step 416 is<br>
then used in repeats of steps 402 - 408 to improve the optimization and<br>
calibration of the engine 12.<br>
