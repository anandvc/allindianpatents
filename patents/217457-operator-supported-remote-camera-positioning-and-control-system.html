				<td>OPERATOR SUPPORTED REMOTE CAMERA POSITIONING<br>
AND CONTROL SYSTEM<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to camera supports. More particularly, the invention relates to<br>
supports for remotely positioning cameras.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In cinemagraphic and other visual art endeavors, it is often desired to increase the<br>
range of viewing perspectives, to obtain various special effects and capture scenes from<br>
angles and elevations that are not available from a camera on a tripod or held by a camera<br>
man. This is particularly true in the recording of sporting events. Various systems have been<br>
developed to address these goals, including elevating and pivoting boom arms, as shown, for<br>
example, in Samuelson, U.S. Patent No. 4,849,778, and steady cam mounts for aircraft, as<br>
shown, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 4,156,512.<br>
While these approaches do increase the range of viewing angles and elevations, they<br>
often involve complicated componentry that is typically difficult to be operated by the<br>
cameraman alone and is almost certainly too large to be held and maneuvered by cameraman<br>
alone. The size of the equipment often limits access to desired viewing and recording areas.<br>
It would therefore be advantageous to provide a remote camera positioning system<br>
that is capable of being supported, operated and maneuvered by a sole cameraman.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide a camera support that is completely portable<br>
by a single operator.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide an operator supported camera system<br>
that can position the camera a substantial distance from the operator while providing<br>
positional and pointing control by the operator.<br>
It is yet another object of the invention to provide an operator supported camera<br>
system that can be readily maneuvered by the operator while maintaining image quality.<br>
It is still another object of the invention to provide an operator supported camera<br>
system that is lightweight to avoid premature operator fatigue.<br>
These and other objects of the invention are achieved by a remote camera positioning<br>
system for use and support by a sole operator. The system can include a camera; a camera<br>
positioner supporting the camera; and a monitor for viewing images generated by the camera.<br>
The monitor has attachments for mounting the monitor on an operator in the operator"s field<br>
of vision. The camera positioner has an operator interface for supporting said camera<br>
positioner and spatially maneuvering the camera through the camera positioner. The camera<br>
positioner disposes the camera out of arm"s reach at least three feet away from the operator<br>
interface. Thus, a sole operator can support, position and maneuver a camera out of arm"s<br>
reach for obtaining an expanded range of views while monitoring the camera"s views in a<br>
self-contained manner.<br>
The camera can be a video camera, and the monitor can be a video monitor.<br>
The monitor attachments can be adapted to mount the monitor to the operator"s torso, such as<br><br>
by straps, belts or the iike. Alternatively, the monitor attachments include frames, similar to<br>
glasses frames for mounting the monitor in front of the operator"s eyes.<br>
The operator interface permits the operator to support the camera positioner and to<br>
spatially maneuver the camera through the camera positioner. The operator interface can<br>
perform the functions through a combined construction, such as hand grips. Alternatively,<br>
the operator interface can include a plurality of components including a hand interface, such<br>
as grips, and a body interface, such as support straps for attachment across the operator"s<br>
chest and back.<br>
According to an aspect of the invention, the camera positioner is an elongated boom,<br>
which can be telescoping, and the operator interface includes two separated hand grip<br>
surfaces adjacent a proximal end of said boom while the camera is mounted adjacent a distal<br>
end of the boom opposite said proximal end. The operator interface is such an embodiment<br>
can further include an auxiliary support connected to the boom along its length and being<br>
adapted for securement to the operator.<br>
The auxiliary support can, for example, include a strap for mounting around the<br>
operator"s body, a biased line extending from the strap, a pulley attached to an end of the line<br>
opposite the strap; a play line along which the pulley travels; and a frame extending laterally<br>
from the boom and providing opposed terminal mounts for the play line, whereby an operator<br>
can bear a portion of the system weight while permitting free maneuverability of boom in all<br>
directions.<br>
The system can also include various camera head arrangements. For example, the<br>
system can include two camera servos for controlling the pan and tilt of the camera relative to<br>
the boom. A camera-side servo can provide an output shaft and a camera support arm<br><br>
extending transversely from the output shaft for mounting the camera. A boom-side servo<br>
can provide a second output shaft and a servo support arm extending from said second output<br>
shaft for mounting the camera-side servo. Preferably, a break-away member having a<br>
weakened portion and a planar platform to which the boom-side servo is mounted is<br>
provided. The breakaway member is removably attached to the distal end of said elongated<br>
boom to break away the camera head in the case of impact or other potentially damaging<br>
collision. The system can also include at least one hand operated controller for the camera-<br>
side servo and the boom-side servo, said controller being mounted on said boom adjacent one<br>
of said hand grip surfaces.<br>
The system can further include a power pack for supplying power to the monitor, the<br>
servos and the camera, said power pack having attachments for mounting the power pack to<br>
the operator. A video recorder for storing images generated by the camera can also be<br>
provided. The video recorder can have recorder attachments for mounting the video recorder<br>
to the operator; and image cabling for transmitting signals from the camera to the monitor,<br>
said image cabling extending along an interior of the boom; power cabling for coupling the<br>
power pack to the monitor, camera and servos; and control cabling for transmitting control<br>
signals from the controller to the servos.<br>
Thus, the invention provides a system for enabling a sole operator to independently<br>
support, maneuver and monitor a camera remotely positioned beyond arm"s reach. In this<br>
way, a wider range of views can be obtained in self-contained manner.<br><br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
A more thorough understanding of the invention can be gained from a reading of the<br>
following detailed description of embodiments of various aspects of the invention, together<br>
with a viewing of the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
FIG. 1 is a perspective view of a sports environment illustrating an application of a<br>
remote camera positioning system according to the invention;<br>
FIG. 2 is a perspective view of an operator utilizing an embodiment of a remote<br>
camera positioning system according to the invention, illustrating a body assisted support;<br>
and<br>
FIG. 3 is a perspective view of a camera head assembly for use in an embodiment of<br>
an operator supported camera system according to the invention.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention is directed to camera supports. The invention provides a camera<br>
support that can be held, maneuvered and controlled by a single operator. The camera<br>
support permits remote placement of the camera from the operator at substantial distances,<br>
permitting placement and pointing from significant heights as well as wide lateral<br>
placements. Additionally, the remote positioning provides a large range of motion of an<br>
operator supported camera system.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, an embodiment 10 of the invention can include a camera 12<br>
supported by a camera positioner, such as a boom 14. The camera positioner provides an<br>
operator interface, such as the handle region 16 of the boom 14, to enable the operator 18 to<br>
support the boom 14 and spatially maneuver the camera 12. With the boom 14, the operator<br>
18 is able, for example, to track up close the travel of a skater 20 in a half-pipe 22. This<br>
viewing perspective is made possible by a remote camera positioning system according to the<br>
invention and can be managed by a single operator.<br>
As exemplified by the boom 14, a camera positioner according to the invention<br>
disposes a camera in a region of out of the operator"s arm"s reach. This remote positioning is<br>
at least three feet from the operator interface, such as the handle region 16 of the boom 14.<br>
As used throughout this specification and the accompanying claims, the three foot<br>
distance between the operator interface and the camera position is intended to convey the<br>
remote positioning of the camera out of arm"s reach; thus, in measuring the three foot spacing,<br>
the point of reference in the operator interface region can be the point closest to the operator<br>
during use. In the case of the boom 14, the operator interface includes the grip region 24 at<br>
the very end of the boom 14 as held by the right hand of the operator 10, and the three foot<br><br>
expanse is measured from this point, rather than the more distal region gripped by the left<br>
hand of the operator 18. Of course, the boom 14 can extend well beyond this three foot<br>
distance, as shown.<br>
In FIG. 2, the embodiment is partially illustrated from the operator end. The boom 14<br>
is only partially depicted, and in reality, extends to a distal end at which a camera assembly is<br>
mounted, an example of which is shown in FIG. 4 and will be discussed later in this<br>
specification.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, a remote camera positioning system also includes a monitor for<br>
viewing images generated by the camera (not shown). According to the invention, the<br>
monitor is mounted on the operator 18 in the operator"s field of vision. Thus, a sole operator<br>
18 can support, position and maneuver a camera (not shown, see FIG. 1) out of arm"s reach<br>
for obtaining an expanded range of views while monitoring the camera"s views in a self-<br>
contained manner.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the monitor is included in an image recorder, such as<br>
videocassette recorder 26, for storing images generated by the camera. The monitor can be<br>
independent of the recorder 26, and a recorder 26 is optional; In the preferred mode,<br>
however, the monitor is a flip-up type monitor 28 mounted to the recorder 26. The preferred<br>
recorder is a DVCR, such as the Sony GV-D700, with its own high specific capacity lithium<br>
ion rechargeable battery (not shown). The recorder also preferably allows review of any takes<br>
already shot.<br>
The monitor can be mounted to the operator is a number of different ways. In one<br>
embodiment, the monitor 28 together with its associated recorder 26 is secured by a belly<br>
pack positioned at the operator"s waist. The belly pack can be, for example, a Radio Shack<br><br>
portable CD player pouch with zipper lid that accommodates the flip out monitor of the<br>
DVCR.<br>
The monitor alternatively can include video monitor goggles 30, such as Lightweight<br>
Sony PLM-A35 LCD goggles, fed with the system video signal. This arrangement allows<br>
"heads up" operation of the camera positioning system 10 without having to stare at the belly<br>
pack. This greatly eases framing of the video subject. Use of the goggles 30 in the system<br>
also allows for a lighter weight videocassette recorder without a monitor to be used.<br>
As an elongated boom 14 is used as a camera positioner, the operator interface can<br>
include hand interfaces 16 on the boom and body interfaces, such as a harness 32. For longer<br>
booms, it may be desired to provide additional stabilization and support for the increased<br>
bending moment by providing a harness 32 to utilize the operator"s body, in addition to the<br>
operator"s hands, to support the boom 14.<br>
The body interface can be arranged, as in the harness 32, to provide support to the<br>
boom 14, while the hand interface 16 is provided to primarily enable the operator to<br>
maneuver the boom and thus the camera position. Of course, the hand interface 16 can also<br>
simultaneously serve to support the boom 14, with or without the assistance of a body<br>
interface, like the harness 32.<br>
The hand interface can include two hand grips 34, 36 spaced along the length of the<br>
boom 14. The grip regions can be identified, for example, by padding, foam or the like.<br>
Designated and separate grip areas for the operator"s hands can be provided with one grip 36<br>
preferably at the end of the boom. Alternatively, a continuous region (not shown) can be<br>
provided to allow the operator to vary hand positions along the boom 14. The boom 14 could<br>
at a minimum provide no designated areas, in which case the surface of the boom 14 itself<br><br>
can serve as a hand interface.<br>
The operator body interface can be arranged in a variety of manners, so long as it<br>
provides the operator 18 with the ability to use his body beyond his hand to support the boom.<br>
The operator body interface can include an auxiliary support 38 connected to the boom 14<br>
along its length and adapted to secure to the operator 18. The auxiliary support 38 can<br>
include a strap 40 for mounting around the operator"s body. A biased line 42 extends from<br>
the strap 40 to a pulley 44. A play line 46 travels along the pulley 44, and a frame 48, made<br>
of four struts 50 extending laterally from the boom 14, provides opposed terminal mounts for<br>
the play line 46. In use, an operator 18 can bear a portion of the system weight while<br>
permitting free maneuverability of boom 14 in all directions. Lateral swings of the boom 14<br>
are permitted with the corresponding passage of the play line 46 through the pulley 44.<br>
The biased line 42 can be provided by a spring 52. The spring 52 permits flexible<br>
vertical and axial movement of the boom 14 relative to the operator 18.<br>
Alternative support arrangements can be provided, ranging from the hand based<br>
support for smaller positioners to body assisted supports for longer or heavier positioning<br>
systems. What is important is that the support enables a sole operator to support and<br>
maneuver the positioner and the associated camera without assistance.<br>
The boom 14 used in the current embodiment is a lightweight 7-section, 7-meter long<br>
fiberglass telescoping windsock pole available at many kite stores. For a 4.0 ounce camera<br>
head and an un-stiffened windsock pole, the practical length limit of this boom system is 5<br>
meters. Methods of stiffening are covered later in this specification. The thin walled circular<br>
cross-section offers the greatest stiffness per weight by concentrating all of the material as far<br>
from the neutral axis of the beam as possible.<br><br>
One source for telescoping tube sets is a telescoping fiberglass windsock pole<br>
available to consumers through Premier Kites of Hyattsville, Maryland. Of the 4 different<br>
lengths of windsock poles available from that vendor, the 22 ft length model 77922 is the best<br>
choice because of its larger tubing diameter and therefore greater stiffness. This windsock<br>
tube set comes in 7 one meter long sections, with the two thinnest sections at the tip discarded<br>
in the current embodiment. All of the tube sections of this telescoping wind sock pole are<br>
relatively thin walled with wall thickness at the ends on the order of 0.050 inches. The<br>
sections are butted for reinforcing of the friction fit contact areas when extended. The root<br>
section of this tube set has a root outside diameter of approximately 1.53 inches. Each<br>
section has approximately 0.12 inches less outside diameter than its next larger tube, and<br>
tapers approximately 0.080 inches in outside diameter along its length. The tube sets come<br>
with a thick layer of paint and primer which protects the relatively thin fiberglass wall and<br>
weighs approximately 10% the weight of the total tube set. A 7 section 22 ft. long tube as<br>
purchased weighs approximately 2.2 pounds. The cutting to length and painting of these tube<br>
sets is not tightly controlled and therefore weights and lengths are subject to significant<br>
variation from one tube set to the next.<br>
Excessive bending flexibility of the tubing can negatively affect image quality<br>
produced by the camera support system. The weight and stiffness of the tubing are therefore<br>
optimized to maximize its stiffness-to-weight ratio. First, the heavy coats of paint and primer<br>
are removed. Bundles of extremely high stiffness boron fiber are then added to each tube<br>
section at one-quarter points around its circumference. 5.6 mil boron fibers from Textron<br>
Systems of Wilmington, MA are used, with larger numbers of fibers on the root or proximal<br>
tube sections, and successively fewer fibers on farther outboard or distal tube sections. The<br><br>
sections are then coated with a very light (0.5 ounce per square yard) fiberglass cloth and<br>
epoxy. After curing, the modified tube sections are individually finished and matched for<br>
proper telescoping fit, which is necessary since the outside diameters have been altered by the<br>
boron and glass-epoxy processes. The finished weight of each tube section after this process<br>
can be kept within plus or minus 1% to 2% of the original weight. The bending stiffness of<br>
tube sections, calculated by measuring "ringing" frequencies of a tube tapped while in free<br>
fall, may be increased on the order of 15% by the above stated modification process.<br>
The hand held portion of this embodiment, ready for use in a remote camera<br>
positioning system, weighs approximately 2.26 pounds (1025 grams) at its full 16.4 foot<br>
length (5 meter) with a 4 ounce, 2 channel (pan and tilt) camera head. When the other<br>
operator supported components such as the VCR with its own battery, the boom power source<br>
and the monitor goggles are added, the total system weight is approximately 6.8 pounds<br>
(approximately 3.1 kg). This weight varies with the exact system configuration. Smaller<br>
batteries can reduce that weight half a pound or more, and shorter boom lengths also reduce<br>
the total system weight by a few to several ounces per meter.<br>
For indoor or confined space uses, shorter camera boom lengths are often necessary.<br>
The thin walled circular section telescoping windsock poles are available in shorter lengths,<br>
which have smaller diameters. The smaller diameter tubes have less bending and torsional<br>
stiffness than the longest version. Such lack of stiffness can contribute to poor image quality<br>
both in positioning and pointing error or "wobble". To maximize stiffness, the maximum<br>
diameter version of this family of telescoping booms serves as a starting point for the camera<br>
boom effort.<br>
The tube section joints are extended to a given extension preload to insure a tight fit.<br><br>
The joint is then jig-drilled in a drill press to produce a repeatable orthogonal set of holes for<br>
locking pins. Lightweight carbon fiber locking pins insure that the joints of the telescoping<br>
boom will not slip during acrobatic maneuvering or when the boom is held vertically and<br>
gravity acts to collapse the boom. The pins are ideally friction fit into the holes, and are also<br>
held in place with a rubber band or safety clip.<br>
Once the length or number of segments is determined based on the requirements of<br>
the shot, the proximal-most or largest diameter sections of the telescoping tube are used. To<br>
maximize stiffness and minimize weight, the unnecessary distal sections of the telescoping<br>
tube are removed through the proximal end of the tube to configure the boom length for the<br>
shot. The remaining sections are then pinned and the boom head is pinned into the distal tube<br>
section.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, the camera 12 is connected to the boom 14 (shown broken away)<br>
at the end remote from the operator (not shown). The embodiment includes an assembly<br>
collectively referred to as the boom head 54, including a weak link 56, a cable break-out<br>
spider 58, two servos 60, 62 for each function of pan and tilt, servo arms 64, 66 and<br>
accompanying standoffs/attachment hardware, cable strain relief and the camera 12.<br>
The weak link 56 can be provided to allow the boom head 54 breakaway from the<br>
boom 14, in potentially damaging situations, such as camera collisions with external objects.<br>
The breakaway can assist in absorbing the impact forces and reduce the possible damage to<br>
the camera or servo mechanisms.<br>
The weak link 56 is preferably a narrow tube drilled with the same hole pattern as the<br>
telescoping boom segments. The holes 68 are a relatively large fraction of the diameter of the<br>
weak link tubing 56, giving the stress concentration necessary to induce failure if any part of<br><br>
the head assembly 54 is contacted with enough force. The weak link tubing 56 can be<br>
lightweight thin walled fiberglass arrow shaft stock. The weak link tubing 56 is preferably<br>
kept to a relatively low slenderness ratio (short) to minimize bending contributions. At the<br>
end of the weak link tubing 56, a lightweight plywood plate 70 the size of the end face of a<br>
servo 60 is preferably epoxied for purposes of mounting the servo 60.<br>
A servo 60 can be mounted on this plate 70 using double sided adhesive tape to<br>
eliminate shear slippage and two lightweight nylon cable ties (not shown) to maintain a<br>
compressive load between the servo 60 and the plywood plate 70.<br>
The two servos 60, 62 are referred to as boom-side servo 60 and camera-side servo<br>
62. Each servo is preferably stripped of unnecessary weight by trimming the mounting<br>
flanges from the case and by replacing each servo"s stock 3-wire pigtail and connector with<br>
lightweight wire and connectors, for a mass reduction of approximately 10-30%. This<br>
requires de-soldering and re-soldering directly to the surface-mount-component PC<br>
amplifier/controller board found inside the servo upon disassembly, with appropriate<br>
grounding and technical protocol.<br>
The servo case itself may also be further cut to reduce mass if it has excess structural<br>
strength for the required task. The servo case screws may be cut to partial length for the same<br>
effort. Various other material removal approaches can be employed to reduce the weight of<br>
the boom head assembly.<br>
The servos 60, 62 used to point the camera 12 are preferably both Hitec 225 metal<br>
gear, aluminum output shaft servos to support the loads induced during acrobatic<br>
maneuvering. Preferably, the servos 60, 62 are equipped with rigid, fairly strong thick<br>
plastic "X" arms. For the boom-side servo 60, the "X" arm can be trimmed of two of the<br><br>
thinner and one of the thicker excess arms and extended in the remaining direction using<br>
another piece of thin lightweight plywood 72, attached with very small steel bolts, nuts, and<br>
washers using a spec limit high preload torque for maximum compressive load between the<br>
arm (not shown) and the plywood arm extension 72. The nuts are then preferably locktight<br>
fixed to assure against vibration induced loosening during servo operation and aggressive<br>
maneuvering.<br>
The arm and the extension 72 are preferably the width of the servo to be attached to<br>
them--the camera-side servo 62. The thickest of the supplied servo arms is used to increase<br>
both torsional and beam rigidity of the camera support means. A lightweight (medium to low<br>
density depending on the length) balsa standoff 74 can be glued to the end of the plywood<br>
arm extension 72, grain parallel to the standoff direction.<br>
The camera-side servo 62 is stuck to the balsa standoff 74 using double-sided<br>
adhesive tape to prevent shear slippage and held on compressively using two medium sized<br>
zip ties (not shown). The smaller of the plastic "X" arms supplied with these servos is<br>
preferably lashed to the camera 12 using small zip ties, allowing the camera 12 to be affixed<br>
to the camera-side servo 62.<br>
For the illustrated current embodiment, a lighter weight servo such as the Hitec HS85<br>
metal gear of the Hitec HS 81 metal gear would work in place of the heavier HS-225 for the<br>
camera-side servo. With the daisy chained servo configuration, the less weight the servo<br>
must support and drive, the lighter the servo that may be used, so a lighter servo may be used<br>
on the camera side of the servo chain. For a lighter camera, at 1/2 or 1/3 ounce, very light<br>
servos such in the 1/2 ounce or even 1/4 ounce weight range may be used, for a substantially<br>
lighter boom head weight in the 1 to 2 ounce range. Since the servos are sized according to<br><br>
the weight of the camera, camera weight is the major driver in the total weight of the boom<br>
head. Since camera head weight is a major driver in required boom stiffness, boom strength<br>
and therefore boom weight, the camera itself is the primary driver in the total weight of the<br>
hand held portion of the camera boom system.<br>
The camera can be a PC-17 from SuperCircuits. This is a miniature fixed focus, high depth<br>
of field, high resolution color CCD camera with a very high resolution of 450 lines and an<br>
unmodified weight of 2.5 ounces. These specifications give the camera a relatively high<br>
resolution-to-weight ratio of 180 lines-per-ounce. As new cameras continue to be developed in<br>
smaller sizes (lighter weights) and higher resolutions, the resolution-to-weight ratio may be used<br>
as one guideline for camera selection. If there is a specific resolution required for a specific<br>
application, then a camera of greater mass may be necessary. Automatic functions of the camera<br>
preferably include gain control, white balance, black balance, shutter (1/60 to 1/100,000 second),<br>
color saturation, color hue, and color luminance help keep weight to a minimum since no<br>
auxiliary components are necessary for any of these tasks. Connectors and cabling may be<br>
modified or omitted to save weight.<br>
The camera preferably comes with a stock "RCA" type video jack and a coax power<br>
connector. These two connectors can be replaced with a micro coax connector and a micro power<br>
connector, respectively., both of specialty design. Replacing both of these connectors with<br>
lightweight versions produces a weight saving of 0.4 ounces for a modified camera weight of 2.1<br>
ounces and a modified resolution-to-weight ratio of 214 lines-per-ounce. The specialty design<br>
lightweight coaxial and power connectors are described in detail in the cabling section of this<br>
specification.<br>
Another example of a good camera choice for a camera boom is the SuperCircuits PC-53XS,<br><br>
a coior camera with a resolution of 380 lines and an unmodified weight of 1/2 ounce. This<br>
camera has an unmodified resolution-to-weight ratio of 760 lines-per-ounce. This camera also<br>
comes with relatively heavy connectors compared to the weight of the camera itself. Replacing<br>
both of these connectors with lightweight versions produces a modified weight of 1/3 ounce for<br>
a modified resolution-to-weight ratio of 1140 lines-per-ounce. This relatively high resolution-to-<br>
weight ratio is offset by the practical limits of the lower resolution of this color video camera.<br>
The command and data handling system carries camera pointing commands from a controller<br>
(not shown) at the operator end to the servos 60, 62 and camera signals from the camera 14 back<br>
to the monitor (not shown, see Fig. 2). Some of the subsystem components may be located along<br>
the length of and at the distal end of the positioner, and are therefore can be of an extremely<br>
weight critical nature.<br>
With respect to cabling, there are preferably two cables that run the length of the boom 14.<br>
The first is a 4-conductor ribbon cable to carry +6 volt and +12 volt power and two servo<br>
commands from the operator controller to the camera head. The ribbon cable is stranded copper<br>
core to give as much flexibility with as little resistance as possible. For the 20 foot long ribbon<br>
cable of the 5 meter boom, 28 AWG# serves this purpose. The second cable is a very thin<br>
coaxial cable (RG-178, with an O.D. of only 0.078") to carry the camera signal back to the<br>
recorder and whose shield serves as a common ground path for all of the boom head electrical<br>
components including both servos, camera power, and video signal. The coaxial cable shield has<br>
a 2-inch long pigtail with a single sub-D connector terminal at each end to break out the common<br>
ground used by the multiple electrical components of the boom head and the multiple controllers<br>
at the proximal end of the boom. The coaxial cable shield serves as the common ground in order<br>
to minimize the number of conductors and therefore the overall weight of the full-length boom<br><br>
cable. The ribbon cable carries power for the servos and the camera, and one variable pulse<br>
width TTL position command signal for each of the two servos. The coaxial and ribbon cables<br>
have connectors at each end for modularity to facilitate trouble shooting, easy reconfiguration,<br>
maintenance and upgrades. All power cable connectors have sockets on the power source side<br>
to avoid the shorting hazard of power on exposed pins. The ribbon cable has a four-conductor<br>
section of integrated circuit socket as a connector at the distal end, strain relieved with preferably<br>
clear heat shrink tubing for ease of inspection and damage detection. Said connector is keyed<br>
visually to prevent application of incorrect voltage to the camera or the servos. The proximal end<br>
of the boom ribbon cable has a similar four-conductor section of integrated circuit pins that is<br>
similarly strain relieved and keyed.<br>
The camera boom cable connects to a "break-out spider" at the each end. The distal, or boom<br>
head, break-out spider 76 has a four-conductor section 78 from an integrated circuit socket with<br>
its pins exposed, and a grounding pigtail 80 with a sub-D pin termination, both of which are<br>
strain relieved with preferably clear heat shrink tubing for ease of inspection and damage<br>
detection. Again, the .four-conductor connector is keyed visually to prevent application of<br>
incorrect voltage to the camera or the servos. The distal break-out spider 76 also has 3-conductor<br>
"JST" type micro connectors 82 for each servo 60, 62 that deliver a ground path, a +6 volt path,<br>
and a command signal path to the servos 62, 62. The "JST" type connectors 82 are lighter than<br>
other connectors, such as the Futaba-J type, which is important since every gram saved at the<br>
distal end of the boom counts towards image stability. The distal break-out spider 76 also has<br>
a micro power connector 84 to supply a ground path and a +12 volt path to the camera 12, and<br>
a light weight 3000 micro Farad capacitor 86 between the + 6 volt servo power and the common<br>
ground to reduce/eliminate servo motor noise from the video ground path.<br><br>
An operator end breakout spider (not shown) also has a Futaba-J type power plug and a<br>
Futaba-J type servo command plug for each of the two camera pointing channels. Lightweight<br>
Futaba-J connectors allow the servo drivers or pointing controllers (not shown) to be modular<br>
and interchangeable to facilitate trouble shooting, easy reconfiguration (channel swapping),<br>
placement of servo signal reverser, maintenance and upgrades. Futaba-J connectors for the<br>
pointing controllers also allow the manual servo drivers typical of the radio controlled model<br>
hobby type to be used with lightweight connectors supplied. The proximal breakout spider has<br>
one Futaba-J type socket connector to receive a Futaba-J type power plug from the operator"s<br>
power supply.<br>
The proximal end of the coaxial boom cable has a military-specification gold plated SMB<br>
coaxial connector for durability and a de-mating force several times the weight of the coaxial<br>
cable segment coming from the operator recorder and power source. This allows for physically<br>
gymnastic motion of the operator and the boom without the coaxial cable disconnecting under<br>
its own weight.<br>
With respect to the recording and monitoring equipment and their support attached to the<br>
operator, the operator carries a belly pack with a portable digital videocassette recorder and a<br>
power source, preferably a 12-volt battery that also has a 6-vort tap. This belly pack battery is<br>
preferably a high specific capacity of 1200 mAHr Nickel Metal Hydride and is fast chargeable<br>
(high current capable) for charging convenience. The 12-volt wire from the belly pack battery<br>
preferably has an on-off switch in series so that camera power (12 volts) is switch-able. The<br>
switch has a relatively high switch force and is contained within the belly pack to prevent<br>
inadvertent switching off of the camera. The switch has a connector for charging of the 12-volt<br>
belly pack battery. The connector on the belly pack battery pigtail has the 12 volts lead in the<br><br>
signal position of the Futaba-J connector (same end as the key flange) to allow for charging with<br>
any model hobby "smart charger" or peak detection charger. The 6-volt power is always live, so<br>
when power is applied to the boom the servo controllers and the servos become active. The<br>
camera may then be switched on once pointing aliveness and functionality have been confirmed.<br>
To drive the servos and their controllers, a 6 volt battery can be used. Alternatively, a 4.8<br>
volt battery can be provided. As individual components, the servos and the controllers work fine<br>
on either. The servos are faster and higher torque at the higher voltage, and they also make the<br>
camera pointing jerky due to the limited number of digital steps in the decoded position<br>
(interpreted by the amp/controller board within the servo). This makes narrow angle lenses<br>
impractical. Too far below 4.8 volts, the logic circuitry in either the servo or the controller starts<br>
to die, as does the quality of the variable pulse-width command signal from the hand controllers<br>
by the time it travels down 20+ feet of unshielded narrow gauge ribbon cable. The solution to<br>
this problem would be to power the hand controllers in the 6-volt range, and the servos at some<br>
reduced voltage to produce slightly slower, smoother camera pointing motion.<br>
The coaxial cable from the recorder to the boom has a standard right angle video plug at the<br>
proximal end to fit into the jack on the side of the DVCR without protruding from the belly pack<br>
easily. It is slightly heavier then the boom segment of coax, with approximately 0.1" O.D. to<br>
survive wear and tear associated with being exposed.<br>
The coaxial connector between the camera and the boom cable can be hand built from a high<br>
current connector pair, a sub-D connector termination pair, and heat shrink tubing. Radio Shack<br>
part numbers (274-151) and (274-154) are the male and female sides of the coaxial shield or<br>
outer jacket, respectively. The back end of these crimp type connectors, designed to crimp the<br>
insulation of the wire, is removed to reduce weight. The mid portion of these connectors,<br><br>
designed to crimp the conductor, is trimmed to crimp the size of the coaxial cable shield to be<br>
used. The hemispherical end of the male side connector can be removed to leave an open-ended<br>
cylinder, and the trimmed edge is de-burred and smoothed.<br>
The sub-D pin and socket crimp connectors are also trimmed to remove weight by cutting<br>
off the crimp flanges designed to hold the insulation of the wire for strain relief. The mid-section<br>
of the sub-D connector terminations are crimped onto the center of the coaxial cable. The pin<br>
of the male sub-D is cut to approximately 1/3 to 1/2 of its original length to make it shorter than<br>
the shield cylinder in which it sits inside. This insures that electrical continuity of the shield (the<br>
ground path) is established before electrical contact of the positive voltage signal upon mating.<br>
Heat shrink tubing of appropriately small diameter is used as strain relief to hold the sub-D<br>
connector to the dielectric of the coaxial cable and also to insulate the cable end of the sub-D<br>
from the shield braid of the coaxial cable. This piece of heat shrink tubing should be placed onto<br>
the coaxial dielectric after pulling back the shield braid 3 to 5 mm depending on the diameter of<br>
the cable (less for the 0.070 O.D. RG-178 and more for the thicker belly pack cable) and before<br>
crimping the sub-D connector onto the center conductor of the coaxial cable.<br>
The micro coaxial connectors are arranged with both sockets on one side of the connector and<br>
both pins on the other side. The coaxial cables to be connected are often of different diameters,<br>
since it is the short camera coaxial pigtail that is to be mated with the very thin boom coaxial<br>
cable. No matter what the diameters of the two cables, strain relief, centering, relative<br>
positioning of inner and outer contacts, and of course electrical properties (continuity across the<br>
crimps and insulation between signal and shield) are the primary goals of the micro coaxial<br>
connector build-up process. The entire length of the female sub-D is covered in heat shrink<br>
tubing back to the region where the shield female will be crimped onto the shield braid. This<br><br>
tubing serves to insulate the sub-D female from the shield male connector during the mating and<br>
while mated. Then a piece of larger diameter heat shrink tubing is applied to the female sub-D<br>
connector starting where the shield male connector reaches in the mated state and ending where<br>
the female shield connector is crimped to the shield braid. This piece of heat shrink tubing<br>
shrinks to slightly larger than the inside diameter of the shield female termination, and serves to<br>
hold the inner female centered within the shield female. Continuing with the build-up of the<br>
female-female (FF) side connector, the shield female is then crimped onto the coaxial shield<br>
braid at the position along the cable such that the ends of the two female contacts are at the same<br>
station along the cable axis after a (preferred clear for inspection and damage detection) final<br>
outer heat shrink tubing section has been positioned onto the cable. Once crimped, the female<br>
shield termination is then covered and secured using the heat shrink tubing. The tubing serves<br>
as further strain relief for the female shield and keeps the otherwise exposed edges of the locking<br>
flanges of that crimp connector from scratching or damaging any fault intolerant or notch<br>
sensitive components of the camera boom system.<br>
The male-male (MM) side of the micro coaxial connector is then completed in the same<br>
fashion as the FF side. The exception is that the end of the center pin should be approximately<br>
2 or 3 mm short of the end of the male shield for reasons previously stated. The layered heat<br>
shrink tubing is used in the same fashion as in the FF side to accomplish strain relief, electrical<br>
insulation between the center conductor path and the outer shield, and to hold the inner pin<br>
centered within it"s respective shield. The MM side micro coaxial connector is also covered with<br>
clear heat shrink tubing for reasons previously stated.<br>
In the current embodiment, the servo controllers are modified Manuel Servo Drivers from<br>
Custom Electronics of Corpus Christi, TX. They are modified to provide faster signal refresh<br><br>
rates than the stock 20 msec controllers. The refresh rate is also different for each control ler used<br>
on the boom so that they don"t interfere with each other through antenna effects over the long<br>
straight run of unshielded ribbon cable which carries their signals from the proximal spider to<br>
the boom head. The potentiometers are sealed to keep out contamination. The controllers are<br>
preferably removed from their relatively heavy boxes and heat shrink covered to seal them<br>
against shorting through contact with outside objects. They can be strapped to lightweight<br>
aircraft plywood plates using medium sized lightweight nylon zip-tie fasteners and the<br>
potentiometers and centering buttons are also mounted on the same plywood plates. Over-sized<br>
knobs are preferably used on the potentiometers to facilitate a greater degree of fine control input<br>
by the operator.<br>
Each plywood plate an be screwed to a pair of lightweight model airplane muffler mounting<br>
brackets from Dave Brown products using lightweight #10 nylon nuts and bolts. The brackets<br>
can in turn be secured to the proximal segment of the boom tube using a single medium sized<br>
lightweight nylon zip-tie fastener for each bracket. Small strips of thin foam tape with single<br>
sided adhesive on the bracket side of the tape are then placed between the boom tubing and the<br>
brackets to avoid surface abrasion and otherwise eliminate sharp edge contact to the boom tubing<br>
which may induce stress concentrations and undue fatigue damage on the boom tubing.<br>
The power and servo command signal cable pigtails of the controllers are preferably 24<br>
inches long, instead of the usual 8 inch cables, to facilitate reaching to the midpoint of the<br>
proximal boom segment where they mate with the proximal break-out spider. The controller<br>
pigtails typically come with standard Futaba-J type connectors, which are lightweight and allow<br>
for ease of trouble shooting, reconfiguration (channel swapping), maintenance and upgrades.<br>
