				<td>Sewing Machine<br>
The invention relates to a sewing machine.<br>
DE 100 25 851 C1 teaches a sewing machine of the generic type which<br>
includes an arm, a base plate and a needle which is mounted in the arm for<br>
up and down reciprocation, guiding a needle thread. It further comprises a<br>
hook which is lodged in a hook-bearing case in the base plate and rotatable<br>
by a vertical hook-driving shaft for rotation in a direction of rotation, and a<br>
drivable transmission shaft which is mounted in the base plate. A step-up<br>
gear transmission, which is disposed between the transmission shaft and<br>
the hook-driving shaft, is provided for actuation of the hook-driving shaft<br>
at twice the speed of the transmission shaft. A bobbin case is mounted in<br>
the hook for free rotation relative thereto; it houses a bobbin and is pro-<br>
vided with a lifter cam and comprises a stopping rib which combines with a<br>
stopping cam that is stationary in relation to the base plate, preventing the<br>
bobbin case from rotating in the direction of rotation. A case lifter is pro-<br>
vided, comprising a lifter lever that is applicable to the lifter cam and an<br>
operating lever joined thereto non-rotatably. Provision is made for a case-<br>
lifter drive mechanism which comprises a cam with circumferential cam<br>
face. This cam is driven by the hook-driving shaft via a reduction gear at<br>
half the speed of the hook. The operating lever bears against the circumfer-<br>
ential cam face. The constructional requirements of this design are rather<br>
complicated because of the two gears.<br>
German patent 872 148 teaches a retaining mechanism for a bobbin case.<br>
The hook-driving shaft of a hook that is rotatable about a vertical axis is<br>
driven via a step-up gear by a transmission shaft, actuation of which is de-<br>
rived from the sewing-machine drive mechanism. On the transmission<br><br>
shaft, provision is made for an eccentrically disposed as a cam, driving a lifter<br>
lever for the bobbin case by way of a spring-loaded lever. The sensing lever is<br>
pivoted in dependence on the position of the eccentrically arranged cylinder,<br>
releasing or retaining the bobbin case.<br>
It is an object of the invention to embody a sewing machine of the generic type<br>
for the drive mechanism of the case lifter to operate based on especially simple<br>
and reliable means.<br>
This object is attained by the features of the invention. With case-lifter deriving<br>
directly from the front of the transmission shaft, actuation of the lifter takes<br>
place directly at the correct speed, namely that of the transmission shaft which is<br>
only half the speed of the hook. This offers the possibility of a very compact<br>
structure. On the other hand it is not necessary that the hook is disposed directly<br>
above the gearing between the hook-driving shaft and transmission shaft.<br>
Furthermore, the number of structural components is low, reducing the cost of<br>
manufacture. The mass of movable parts is likewise insignificant. Since only a<br>
single gearing is necessary, transmission of the motion is substantially free from<br>
play.<br>
Details of the invention will become apparent from the ensuing description of an<br>
exemplary embodiment, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings,<br>
in which<br>
Fig. 1 is a lateral longitudinal view of a two-thread lock-stitch sewing machine;<br><br>
Fig. 2 is an elevation of the hook-bearing case of the sewing machine<br>
seen in the direction of the arrow II of Fig. 1;<br>
Fig. 3 is a plan view of the hook-bearing case with a case lifter in accor-<br>
dance with the arrow III of Fig. 1;<br>
Fig. 4 is a side view of the cam disk of a case-lifter drive mechanism in<br>
accordance with the arrow IV of Fig. 2; and<br>
Fig. 5 is an illustration, in a coordinate system, of a development of the<br>
cam face of the cam disk.<br>
The two-thread lock-stitch sewing machine seen in Fig. 1 customarily<br>
comprises a top arm 1, a vertical standard 1 and a bottom base plate 3 of<br>
the type of a housing. An arm shaft 4 is mounted in the arm 1, with a nee-<br>
dle bar 5, together with a needle 6, being drivable thereby in up and down<br>
reciprocation. The shaft 4 further actuates a thread lever 7.<br>
The base plate 3 houses a vertical hook 8 which is a two-thread lock-stitch<br>
hook 8 driven in rotation about a vertical axis 9. A hook-driving shaft 10,<br>
which supports the hook 8 and is drivable about the axis 9, is rotatably<br>
lodged in a hook-bearing case 11 that is disposed in the base plate 3. It is<br>
driven by a transmission shaft 12 by means of a step-up gear 13. The<br>
transmission shaft 12 is driven by the arm shaft 4 by means of a synchro-<br>
nous belt drive 14. The synchronous belt drive 14 has a transmission ratio<br>
of 1:1. The step-up gear 13 is dimensioned for a transmission ratio of 1:2.<br>
This means that the hook 8 rotates twice when the arm shaft 4, respectively<br>
the transmission shaft 12, rotates once. For this to be put into practice, the<br><br>
driving bevel gear 15 that is mounted on the transmission shaft 12 has<br>
twice the number of teeth of the driven bevel gear 16 that is mounted on<br>
the hook-driving shaft 10.<br>
A needle plate 17 with a stitch hole 18 is fixed above the hook 8 on the top<br>
side of the base plate 3. The cup-shaped hook 8 comprises a beak 19 which<br>
runs directly past the needle 6 when sunk into the stitch hole 18, seizing a<br>
needle thread 20 held thereby. A bobbin case 21 is lodged in the hook 8; it<br>
is freely rotatable about the axis 9 in relation to the hook 8. The bobbin<br>
case 21, which is also open upwards, comprises a stopping rib 22 of ra-<br>
dially outward projection relative to the axis 9 and upward projection rela-<br>
tive to the needle plate 17, the rib 22 being substantially non-rotatably re-<br>
tained between two stopping cams 23, 24 that are formed on the bottom<br>
side of the needle plate 17.<br>
As seen in particular in Fig. 2, a first lateral air gap 25 is located between<br>
the first stopping cam 23 and the stopping rib 22, a top air gap 26 is located<br>
between the stopping rib 22 and the needle plate 17, and a second lateral air<br>
gap 27 is located between the stopping rib 22 and the second stopping cam<br>
24. In the central position of the stopping rib 22 seen in Fig. 2, the air gaps<br>
25, 26, 27 constitute a continuous duct.<br>
A bobbin 29. which holds an under-thread 28, is disposed in the bobbin<br>
case 21; it is retained in the bobbin case 21 by means of a releasable latch<br>
30. On its top edge, the bobbin case 21 comprises a lifter cam 31 which<br>
stands out substantially radially of the axis 9 and cooperates with a lifter<br>
lever 32. The lifter lever 32 constitutes an arm of a case lifter 33. The case<br>
lifter 33 comprises a lifter shaft 34 which is mounted in the hook-bearing<br>
case 11 for rotation or pivoting motion in a bearing 36 about a vertical axis<br><br>
35 that is parallel to the axis 9. The axial position of the shaft 34 relative to<br>
the hook-bearing case 11 is adjusted and fixed by a set collar 37.<br>
The lifter shaft 34 is part of a case-lifter drive mechanism 38. This mecha-<br>
nism comprises an axial cam disk 39 which is mounted on the shaft 12<br>
frontally upstream of the driving bevel gear 15 and adjustable by a set<br>
screw 39'; and a sensing lever 40 which bears against the axial can disk 39<br>
and is non-rotatably joined to the lifter shaft 34. The sensing lever 40 in the<br>
form of a bolt is transversely inserted into the lifter shaft 34 and adjustably<br>
fixed by a set screw 41 which is disposed in the shaft 34. By its free end,<br>
the lever 40 bears against the frontal cam face 42 of the axial cam disk 39.<br>
The sensing lever 40 is pressed against the cam face 42 by a pre-loaded<br>
helical compression spring 43. To this end, this compression spring 43<br>
bears against the sensing lever 40 on the one hand and against an adjusting<br>
screw 44 on the other, the screw 44 being provided in the hook-bearing<br>
case 11. This screw 44 serves to set the pre-load of the compression spring<br>
43 and thus the load by which the sensing lever 40 bears against the cam<br>
face 42.<br>
The lifter lever 32 is joined to the lifter shaft 34 by means of a screwed<br>
connection 45 so that accurate adjustment of the case lifter 33 relative to<br>
the lifter cam 31 is possible. As seen from Figs. 2, 3 and 4 in total, the<br>
compression spring 43 presses the lifter lever 32 in a direction towards the<br>
lifter cam 31, of course only to the extent allowed by the respective rotary<br>
position of the cam face 42.<br>
As seen in Fig. 5, the cam face 42 is curved such that the sensing lever 40,<br>
and thus the lifter lever 32, make a harmonic motion upon revolution of the<br><br>
cam disk 39. At the highest elevation of the cam face 42 - seen at the top in<br>
Fig. 4 - the maximum lift 46 of the cam face 42 is reached as seen in Fig.<br>
5. In this area, the lifter lever 32 is most remote from the lifter cam 31. In<br>
the lowermost area of the cam face 42 - plotted at the bottom in Fig. 4 -<br>
the minimum lift 47 of the cam face 42 is reached as seen in Fig. 5 i.e., in<br>
this area the lifter lever 32 rests on the lifter cam 31, moving the bobbin<br>
case 21 counter to the direction of rotation 48 of the hook.<br>
If however - as mentioned - the lifter lever 32 lifts off the lifter cam 31,<br>
the bobbin case 21 is entrained in the direction of rotation 48 by the friction<br>
between the hook 8 and bobbin case 21 until the stopping rib 22 rests on<br>
the first stopping cam 23.<br>
The fundamental mode of operation is the same as generally known for<br>
case lifters. When the lifter lever 32 does not rest on the lifter cam 31, then<br>
the stopping rib 22 of the bobbin case 21 bears against the first stopping<br>
cam 23 due to the fact that the bobbin case 21 is entrained by the hook 8 in<br>
the direction of rotation 48. In this case, the second lateral air gap 27 is<br>
enlarged as opposed to the illustration of Fig. 2, whereas the first lateral air<br>
gap 25 is closed. By the sensing lever 40 resting in the area of maximum<br>
lift 46 of the cam face 42, the lifter lever 32 is pivoted to such an extent<br>
that a gap 49 of 1 to 1.5 mm of width forms between the lifter cam 31 and<br>
the lifter lever 32. In the associated position of the hook 8 and the bobbin<br>
case 21, a thread loop that is formed by the needle thread 20 is taken by the<br>
beak 19. The under-thread 28 is guided via the latch 30 to the stitch hole<br>
18. As the hook 8 rotates, the axial cam disk 39 and the cam face 42 make<br>
a rotary motion in the direction of rotation 50, with the speed of the axial<br>
cam disk 39 corresponding to only half the speed of the hook 8.<br><br>
As the hook 8 continues rotating, the thread loop is slung around the sta-<br>
tionary bobbin case 21, which is familiar and customary. Shortly before the<br>
loop is expanded maximally by the hook 8 i.e., prior to it being slung<br>
around the stationary bobbin case 19, the sensing lever 40 reaches the area<br>
of minimum lift 47 of the cam face 42. This starts a pivoting motion of the<br>
case lifter 33 counter to the direction of rotation 48 by the load of the com-<br>
pression spring 43. In the process, the bobbin case 21 is pivoted counter to<br>
the direction of rotation 48. The stopping rib 22 is lifted off the first stop-<br>
ping cam 23. In accordance with Fig. 2 - the stopping rib 22 is moved ap-<br>
proximately centrally between the two stopping cams 23 and 24 so that the<br>
first lateral air gap 25, the top air gap 26 and the second lateral air gap 27<br>
are continuously open. The loop of the needle thread can slide unimpeded<br>
through the duct formed by the air gaps 25, 26, 27.<br>
As the hook 8 continuous rotating, the loop of the needle thread is released.<br>
By continuing rotation of the cam face 42, the sensing lever 40 is pivoted<br>
in a direction towards the maximum lift 46 thereof; the gap 49 between the<br>
lifter lever 32 and the lifter cam 31 is again opened so that the thread loop<br>
can slide unimpeded through this gap 49, combining with the bobbin thread<br>
28 to form a two-thread lock stitch.<br><br>
