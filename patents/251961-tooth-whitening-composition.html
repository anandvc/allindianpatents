				<td>The present invention is generally directed to oral compositions containing an<br>
effective amount of a stain-removing anionic surfactant. In particular, the invention is<br>
directed to oral compositions including a fatty acid salt having at least one hydroxy<br>
functionality.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Unblemished white teeth have long been considered cosmetically desirable.<br>
Unfortunately, in the absence of thorough dental cleaning, teeth can become discolored or<br>
stained from color-causing substances present in food, beverages, tobacco, and the like, and<br>
internal sources such as blood, amalgam-based fillings, and antibiotics (e.g., tetracycline).<br>
The tooth structures that are generally responsible for presenting a stained appearance<br>
are enamel, dentin, and the acquired pellicle. Tooth enamel is predominately formed from<br>
inorganic material, mostly in the form of hydroxyapatite crystals, and further contain<br>
approximately 5% organic material primarily in the form of collagen. In contrast, dentin is<br>
composed of about 20% protein including collagen, the balance existing of inorganic<br>
material, predominately hydroxyapatite crystals, similar to that found in enamel. The<br>
acquired pellicle is a proteinaceous layer present on the surface of tooth enamel which<br>
reforms rapidly after an intensive tooth cleaning.<br>
Discoloration of teeth can result from extrinsic and/or intrinsic staining. Extrinsic<br>
staining of the acquired pellicle can arise as a result of compounds, such as tannins and other<br>
polyphenolic compounds, that have become trapped in and tightly bound to the proteinaceous<br>
layer on the surface of the teeth. Discoloration from this type of staining can usually be<br>
removed by mechanical methods of tooth cleaning. In contrast, mtrinsic staining occurs<br>
when the staining compounds penetrate the enamel and even the dentin, or alternatively, such<br><br>
staining arises from sources within the tooth. Discoloration from intrinsic staining is not<br>
readily amenable to mechanical methods of tooth cleaning. Chemical methods, which utilize<br>
substances that can penetrate into the tooth structure, are usually required to elminate such<br>
discoloration.<br>
Currently, there are a number of methods for removing stains in teeth. These methods<br>
are generally based on the use of abrasives, hydrolytic agents or oxidizing agents to break<br>
down the staining material. For example, mechanical methods of tooth cleaning are known<br>
whereby the stain is mechanically abraded through the use of abrasives or polishing agents<br>
normally employed in toothpaste preparations. Typical preparations containing abrasives are<br>
toothpastes, gels or powder dentifrices, which require close contact with the teeth. Brushing<br>
and similar scrubbing or polishing action is typically required as a compliment to successful<br>
stain removal. Typical abrasives include hydrated silica, calcium carbonate, sodium<br>
bicarbonate and alumina.<br>
Hydrolytic agents including proteolytic enzymes can also be used to whiten teeth.<br>
These products are usually in the form of pastes or gels, and function to whiten teeth by<br>
removing the plaque and calculus that have been entrapped the stain.<br>
Oxidizing agents such as urea peroxide, hydrogen peroxide or calcium peroxide,<br>
represent the most common forms of whitening agents for tooth enamels. It is believed that<br>
peroxides whiten teeth by releasing hydroxyl radicals capable of breaking down the<br>
plaque/stain complex into a form that can be flushed away or removed by an abrasive.<br>
Other active stain-removing components include surface-active agents, such as<br>
anionic surfactants and chelators, which have been incorporated into stain-removing<br>
compositions because of their stain-removing properties. For example, anionic surfactants<br>
typically employed in dentifrice compositions include sodium lauryl sulfate and sodium N-<br>
lauryl sarcosinate. Furthermore, chelators, such as polyphosphates, are typically employed in<br>
dentifrice compositions as tartar control ingredients. For example, tetrasodium<br>
pyrophosphate and sodium tri-polyphosphate are typical ingredients found in such<br>
compositions.<br><br>
Unlike toothpaste, mouthwash and other dentifrice compositions, gum compositions<br>
present unique problems in delivering agents. Chewing gum compositions typically comprise<br>
a water-insoluble gum base which provides the bulk to the gum composition, but which<br>
invariably traps agents having compatibility with the gum base. Adding additional amounts<br>
of an agent is problematical because the same can have an adverse affect on the integrity,<br>
sensory and/or taste properties of the gum composition.<br>
Stain-removing gum compositions are known. For example, gum compositions<br>
including sodium tripolyphosphate and xylitol are known. Also, gum compositions are<br>
known, which include hexametaphosphate and an abrasive silica material. Moreover, a<br>
dental gum is known, which includes the following ingredients: sodium tripolyphosphate,<br>
tetrasodium pyrophosphate, a silica abrasive and zinc acetate. A whitening gum composition<br>
is also known, which includes the abrasives sodium bicarbonate and calcium carbonate, and<br>
is sold under the brand name V6Â®.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,603,920 to Rice discloses a dentifrice composition that may be used<br>
in the form of a gum. The dentifrice composition includes a silica abrasive, a chelating agent<br>
(disclosed as including a pyrophosphate salt) and a surfactant. The surfactant is disclosed as<br>
preferably being selected from sarcosinate surfactants, isethionate surfactants and tartrate<br>
surfactants. Exemplified surfactants are sodium lauryl sarcosinate and sodium lauryl sulfate.<br>
Stain-removing gum compositions are known including anionic surfactants such as<br>
fatty acid salts (see U.S. Patent Nos. 6,471,945, 6,479,071 and 6,696,044). For example,<br>
sodium stearate is a fatty acid salt employed in a gum product sold under the brand name<br>
Trident WhiteÂ®. Sodium stearate is a surfactant containing both hydropbilic and lipophilic<br>
groups. This fatty acid salt is known to solubilize stains into saliva and to loosen the stain so<br>
that they can be easily removed by brushing or salvia. It is also known to enter and break up<br>
the continuous plaque matrix, and to prevent stain build-up by interfering with the calcium<br>
bridge formation between plaque and food product. Encapsulating sodium stearate in sugar<br>
alcohols, and only loosely containing sodium stearate within the gum composition, can<br>
facilitate its release from the gum base.<br>
It would be beneficial to provide further gum compositions for cleaning teeth, which<br>
employ a stain-removing agent that can be both effectively incorporated into a chewing gum<br><br>
composition and released therefrom during chewing in a manner that provides an effective<br>
amount of the stain-removing agent(s). In particular, it would be advantageous to provide<br>
oral compositions, such as chewing gums, that include a stain-removing agent(s) that can be<br>
effectively released from a variety of gum bases, has high solubility in saliva, avoids<br>
interaction with gum ingredients (e.g. lecithin) and avoids chemical changes in acidic<br>
environments, such as fruit gums.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is generally directed to stain-removing oral compositions in<br>
which a stain-removing material has been effectively incorporated therein so that a sufficient<br>
amount is available for a stain-removing effect.<br>
In one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a stain-removing oral<br>
composition including an orally acceptable carrier and a surfactant in an effective amount to<br>
remove stains from teeth, wherein the surfactant comprises a fatty acid salt having at least<br>
one hydroxyl functionality. In some embodiments, the fatty acid salt is a salt of ricinoleic<br>
acid.<br>
The oral compositions of this invention can include, but are not limited to, any<br>
number of compositions, includmg gums, confectionary compositions, toothpastes and<br>
mouthwashes. For example, certain aspects of the present invention relate to stain-removing<br>
gum compositions.<br>
In some embodiments, the stain-removing gum composition may include a gum base<br>
and a surfactant in an effective amount to remove stains from teeth, wherein the surfactant<br>
includes a fatty acid salt having at least one hydroxyl functionality. The fatty acid salt in the<br>
stain-removing gum composition maybe a salt of ricinoleic acid.<br>
For example, in some embodiments, the invention provides a chewing gum<br>
composition including: a salt of ricinoleic acid; and a chelating agent.<br><br>
Furthermore, in some embodiments, there is provided a chewing gum composition<br>
including: a gum base; and a salt of ricinoleic acid. The gum base may also include other<br>
ingredients, such as abrasives and/or chelating agents.<br>
For example, in some embodiments, there is provided a chewing gum composition<br>
including: a gum base; a salt of ricinoleic acid; and a chelating agent.<br>
In some embodiments, there is provided a chewing gum composition including: a<br>
gum base; a salt of ricinoleic acid; a chelating agent; and an abrasive agent.<br>
Moreover, in some embodiments, there is provided a stain-removing gum<br>
composition including at least one ingestible fatty acid salt derived from an extract from the<br>
plant Ricinus spp, Euphorbiaceae. Ricinoleic acid is known to account for about 90% of the<br>
triglyceride fatty acids of castor oil from the seeds of this plant.<br>
In one particular embodiment, the invention provides a chewing gum composition<br>
including: a gum base present in amounts of about 20 to about 40% by weight of the chewing<br>
gum composition; sodium ricinoleate present in amounts of about 0.05 to about 10% by<br>
weight of the chewing gum composition; silicon dioxide present in amounts of about 0.1 to<br>
about 20% by weight of the chewing gum composition; and sodium tripolyphosphate present<br>
in amounts of about 0.1 to about 5% by weight of the chewing gum composition.<br>
Other aspects of the present invention provide methods of preparing and using the<br>
inventive stain-removing compositions herein.<br>
In some embodiments, the invention provides a method for removing stains from<br>
teeth that includes: providing an oral composition comprising an orally acceptable carrier and<br>
a fatty acid salt having at least one hydroxyl functionaUty, and contacting the teeth with the<br>
provided composition for a sufficient time to remove stains from the teeth. For example, in<br>
one embodiment, stains may be removed from teeth by chewing an effective amount of a<br>
stain-removing gum composition provided herein.<br><br>
Gum compositions provided herein can be prepared in any number of ways. For<br>
example, a fatty acid salt having at least one hydroxyl functionality may be combined with a<br>
gum base, or with a coating for the gum, or with both.<br>
In some embodiments, the present invention provides a method of preparing a stain-<br>
removing gum composition that includes: heating a gum base to soften the base; mixing the<br>
softened gum base with a fatty acid salt having at least one hydroxyl functionality to obtain a<br>
substantially homogeneous mixture; cooling .the mixture; and forming the cooled mixture into<br>
individual gum pieces. Other components, such as including, but not limited to, sweeteners,<br>
fiavorants, fillers and colorants may also be included in the gum base, as will be described in<br>
greater detail below.<br>
Furthermore, in some embodiments, the present invention provides a method of<br>
preparing a stain-removing gum composition, wherein the surfactant component is included<br>
within a coating for the gum. In one embodiment, the method includes first heating a gum<br>
base to soften the base; and mixing the softened gum base with at least one of the following<br>
components so as to obtain a substantially homogeneous mixture: elastomer, wax, emulsifier,<br>
bulking agent, filler, humectant, flavorant, colorant, dispersing agent, softener, plasticizer,<br>
preservative, warming agent, cooling agent, tooth whitening agent and sweetener. The<br>
method can further include cooling the mixture; forming the cooled mixture into individual<br>
gum pieces; and next coating the gum pieces with an aqueous coating solution including a<br>
fatty acid salt having at least one hydroxyl functionality. Again, in one form of the present<br>
invention, the fatty acid salt is a salt of ricinoleic acid.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
As used herein the transitional term "comprising," (also "comprises," etc.) which is<br>
synonymous with "including," "containing," or "characterized by," is inclusive or open-<br>
ended and does not exclude additional, unrecited elements or method steps, regardless of its<br>
use in the preamble or the body of a claim.<br>
As used herein, the term "gum compositions" is intended to include any gum<br>
compositions, including "chewing gum" and "bubble gum."<br><br>
The term "fatty acid salt" is a compound formed by replacing hydrogen in a fatty acid<br>
by a metal (or a radical that acts like a metal).<br>
"Hydroxy fatty acid salts" as used herein are fatty acid salts having at least one<br>
hydroxyl functionality. The hydroxyl group may occur at various positions in the carbon<br>
chain which can be saturated or monoenoic. The term is intended to include salts derived<br>
from polyhydroxy fatty acids, which are most frequently produced by lipoxygenase activities.<br>
The present invention is directed to compositions with stain-removing properties for<br>
producing a whitening effect on dental surfaces that are treated with the same. Such<br>
compositions are especially suitable for removing stains, which adhere to, or are entrapped in<br>
materials on, the surface of teeth and for preventing build-up of the stain entrapping material<br>
and stains on dental surfaces. The compositions of the present invention are meant to include<br>
products, which are not intentionally swallowed for purposes of systemic administration of<br>
therapeutic agents, but are retained in the oral cavity for a sufficient time to contact the dental<br>
surfaces for purposes of providing beneficial dental effects.<br>
The compositions of the present invention may be in a form selected from, for<br>
example, dentifrices including mouthwashes, mouth rinses, toothpastes, tooth powders, tooth<br>
hardeners, antiplaque compositions, dental creams, dental flosses, liquids, gels, and the like;<br>
chewing gums, including center-filled gums, and the like; and confectionaries, including<br>
mints, lozenges, and the like. In some embodiments, the compositions of the present<br>
invention are in the form of chewing gums.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, a stain-removing effective amount of a fatty<br>
acid salt having at least one hydroxyl functionality is employed in the compositions of the<br>
present invention to provide effective stain-removing activity. Applicants have discovered<br>
that fatty acid salts having at least one hydroxyl functionality improve stain-removing activity<br>
over the activity of other fatty acid salts. Moreover, relative to other fatty acid salts,<br>
Applicants have discovered that hydroxy fatty acid salts are better able to prevent build-up of<br>
stain entrapping material and stains on dental surfaces. Hydroxy fatty acid salts have a better<br>
affinity for the tooth surface, penetrate the stain/plaque faster, and bind calcium stronger<br>
because of the hydroxyl group occurring at a position in the carbon chain. This facilitates the<br>
effective removal of dental stains and allows for the formation of a film on teeth for<br><br>
preventing further stains. Hydroxy fatty acid salts have a greater solubility in saliva and less<br>
of an affinity for the gum base relative to other fatty acid salts. This allows it to solubilize the<br>
stain into the saliva and loosen it so that it is easily removed by brushing or saliva.<br>
Moreover, unlike other fatty acid salts, hydroxy fatty acid salts do not substantially interact<br>
with ingredients, such as lecithin, and have less of a tendency to change in acidic<br>
environments, such as those present in fruit gum. Significantly, hydroxy fatty acid salts, such<br>
as salts of ricinoleic acid, are also known to have antibacterial efficacy. For example, it is<br>
known to employ castor oil soap in a dentifrice composition in order to render mouth bacteria<br>
and their products harmless by treating them with the composition.<br>
In some embodiments, the stain-removing oral compositions of the present invention<br>
include the combination of a hydroxy fatty acid salt and a chelating agent. Applicants have<br>
discovered that this combination of stain-removing agents improves stain-removing activity<br>
over the activity of the individual component stain-removing agents alone. Moreover, the<br>
combination of stain-removing agents enables reduction of the amount of each of the stain-<br>
removing agents in the composition, avoiding unpleasant tastes and mouthfeel.<br>
Polyphosphates are one group of agents suitable for use in the present invention as chelators.<br>
Chelators are capable of strongly binding with metal ions, such as calcium. For example,<br>
chelating agents are able to complex calcium found in the cell walls of bacteria, a major<br>
component of plaque. Chelating agents can also disrupt plaque by removing calcium from<br>
the calcium bridges which help hold the plaque matrix together.<br>
In some embodiments, stain-removing oral compositions of the present invention<br>
include a hydroxy fatty acid salt and an abrasive agent. This combination of stain-removing<br>
agents improves stain-removing activity over the activity of the individual component stain-<br>
removing agents alone. Furthermore, the combination of stain-removing agents enables<br>
reduction of the amount of each of the stain-removing agents in the composition, avoiding<br>
unpleasant tastes and mouthfeel.<br>
In some embodiments, the stain-removing oral compositions according to the present<br>
invention include the combination of a hydroxy fatty acid salt, a chelating agent and an<br>
abrasive agent. This combination of stain-removing agents significantly improves stain-<br>
removing activity over the activity of the individual components stain-removing agents alone,<br>
and also enables reduction of the amount of each of the stain-removing agents in the<br><br>
composition. In particular, matured stains can be mechanically abraded through the use of<br>
the abrasive. Brushing, scrubbing, polishing, or chewing can compliment successful stain<br>
removal. The hydroxy fatty acid salt and the chelating agent (e.g., a polyphosphate) serve as<br>
surface-active agents. Both of these actives help to soften the pellicle film on the teeth and<br>
have the ability to penetrate the stain matrix and facilitate its removal. Moreover, a hydroxy<br>
fatty acid salt is a film-forming surfactant, which is capable of binding calcium because of its<br>
hydroxyl group. This allows it to have a better affinity for the tooth surface, to penetrate the<br>
stain/plaque faster and to form a film for preventing stain formation.<br>
The term "stain-removing effective amount" as used herein is an amount of the<br>
combination of stain-removing agent(s) disclosed herein that is sufficient to prevent,<br>
eliminate, or at least reduce, the presence of stains on dental surfaces in warm-blooded<br>
animals including humans, but low enough to avoid any undesirable side effects. This stain-<br>
removing effective amount of the combination of stain-removing agent(s) of the present<br>
invention may vary with the type and extent of the particular stain, the age and physical<br>
condition of the warm-blooded animal, including humans being treated, the duration of<br>
treatment, the nature of concurrent therapy, the specific stain-removing agent employed, and<br>
the particular carrier from which the stain-removing agent is applied.<br>
The concentration of the stain-removing agents in the composition of the present<br>
invention depends on the type of composition (e.g., toothpaste, mouthwash and rinse,<br>
lozenge, chewing gum, confectionary, and the like) used to apply the stain-removing agents<br>
to the dental surfaces, due to the differences in the efficiency of the compositions contacting<br>
the teeth and due also to the effective amount of the composition generally used. The<br>
concentration may also depend on the levels of the stains present.<br>
Except as otherwise noted, the amount of the ingredients incorporated into the<br>
compositions according to the present invention is designated as percentage by weight based<br>
on the total weight of the composition.<br>
As described above, a stain-removing oral composition of the present invention can<br>
be a gum composition, such as chewing gum composition. The chewing gum compositions<br>
of the present invention may be coated or uncoated, and be in the form of slabs, sticks,<br>
pellets, balls and the like. The composition of the different forms of the chewing gum<br><br>
compositions will be similar but may vary with regard to the ratio of the ingredients. For<br>
example, coated gum compositions may contain a lower percentage of softeners. Pellets and<br>
balls may have a chewing gum core, which has been coated with either a sugar solution or a<br>
sugarless solution to create the hard shell. Slabs and sticks are usually formulated to be softer<br>
in texture than the chewing gum core. In some cases the hydroxy fatty acid salt may have a<br>
softening effect on the gum base. In order to adjust for any potential undesirable softening<br>
effect that the surfactant active (e.g., hydroxy fatty acid salt) may have on the gum base, it<br>
may be beneficial to formulate a slab or stick gum having a firmer texture than usual (i.e., use<br>
less conventional softener than is typically employed).<br>
Center-filled gum is another common gum form. The gum portion has a similar<br>
composition and mode of manufacture to that described above. However, the center-fill is<br>
typically an aqueous liquid or gel, which is injected into the center of the gum during<br>
processing. The stain-removing agent(s) could optionally be incorporated into the center-fill<br>
during manufacture of the fill, incorporated directly into the chewing gum portion of the total<br>
gum composition, or both. The center-filled gum may also be optionally coated and may be<br>
prepared in various forms, such as in the form of a lollipop.<br>
In some embodiments of the present invention, a coated gum may be formed, wherein<br>
the stain-removing agent(s) is in at least one of the core or the coating. For example, in some<br>
embodiments, an abrasive agent is incorporated into the coating, and the surface actives (i.e.,<br>
surfactant and chelating agent) are incorporated into the gum base. By providing the abrasive<br>
in the coating, the stain is first mechanically abraded by the abrasive in combination with<br>
chewing, which requires close contact with the teeth. In particular, the abrasive tends to have<br>
a short time before it goes into solution. Whereas the abrasive continues to have a chemical<br>
effect in removing the stain after it is released from the coating into the saliva, it may be<br>
advantageous to enhance the mechanical abrasion initially by providing it in the coating<br>
layer. Furthermore, the coating provides another effective vehicle for delivering the hydroxy<br>
fatty acid salt and/or the chelating agent.<br>
It is also well within the contemplation of the present invention that the stain-<br>
removing agent(s) can be incorporated into the gum base. The gum base provides another<br>
effective vehicle for delivering stain-removing agent(s), such as the abrasives and the<br>
surface- active agents because it permits protracted contact of the stain-removing agents to<br><br>
the teeth. For example, the abrasive, surfactant and chelating agent can chemically remove<br>
the stain once released from the gum base and/or coating into saliva.<br>
Chewing gum compositions of the present invention may include a gum base and<br>
most of the other typical chewing composition components, such as sweeteners, softeners,<br>
flavorants and the like. At least one stain-removing hydroxy fatty acid salt is employed in the<br>
inventive gum compositions.<br>
In accordance with one aspect of a gum composition of the present invention, the<br>
stain-removing hydroxy fatty acid salt may be added during the manufacture of the gum<br>
composition, that is, with the sweeteners, flavorants and the like. In another aspect of the<br>
present invention, the hydroxy fatty acid salt may be added as one of the last steps in the<br>
formation of the gum composition. This process allows for the surfactant to be incorporated<br>
into the gum composition without materially binding it therein such as may occur if the stain-<br>
removing agent is mixed directly with the gum base. Thus, although the surfactant is quite<br>
soluble in saliva and can be effectively released from the gum base, by only loosely<br>
containing it within the gum composition, it is anticipated that the surfactant can be even<br>
more effectively released therefrom during a typical chewing operation. Moreover, the<br>
surfactant may be encapsulated or absorbed on a particulate substrate (for example, in a sugar<br>
alcohol, wax or polymer such as polyvinyl acetate) to further facilitate delivery, if desired.<br>
Surfactants<br>
The oral compositions of the present invention may include desirable stain-removing<br>
agent(s) as provided herein. For example, the composition may include anionic surfactants<br>
and nonionic surfactants or mixtures thereof. Anionic surfactants useful herein include<br>
water-soluble salts of hydroxy fatty acids having from 14 to 25 carbon atoms. In some<br>
embodiments, the salt includes a metal ion that can be a divalent metal ion or a monovalent<br>
metal ion. For example, the metal ion can be selected from sodium, potassium, calcium,<br>
magnesium and combinations thereof.<br>
Suitable examples of hydroxy fatty acid salts include salts of higher fatty acids, such<br>
as ricinoleic acid, castor oil and ergot oil. Ricinoleic acid accounts for about 90% of the<br>
triglyceride fatty acids of castor oil, and up to about 40% of the glyceride fatty acids of ergot<br>
oil. Other suitable hydroxy fatty acid salts include, but are not limited to, those derived from<br><br>
the following: lesquerolic acid, densipolic acid, auricolic acid and Î²-dimorphecolic acid.<br>
Combinations of hydroxy fatty acid salts may also be employed.<br>
The water-soluble salts of hydroxy fatty acids may be derived from naturally<br>
occurring fatty acids having at least one hydroxyl functionality, such as ricinoleic acid.<br>
Furthermore, the surfactants employed in the present invention or the fatty acids from which<br>
they are derived may be chemically or enzymatically modified so as to contain at least one<br>
hydroxyl functionality.<br>
The fatty acid salts may be derived from fatty acids found, for example, in animals,<br>
plants or bacteria. The polar -COOH group on short-chain fatty acids (e.g., 2-4 carbon<br>
atoms) and even medium-chain (e.g., 6 to 10 carbon atoms) is typically enough to make them<br>
soluble in water. However, as chain length increases (e.g., from 14 to 25 carbons), the fatty<br>
acid type becomes progressively less water soluble and tends to take on oily or fatty<br>
characteristics. The presence of a hydroxy group on long-chain fatty acids increases water<br>
solubility. Therefore, Applicants have found that water-soluble salts of hydroxy fatty acids<br>
having from 14 to 25 carbon atoms are useful in the compositions of the present invention. In<br>
particular, the water solubility of a hydroxy fatty acid salt allows it to solubilize an<br>
established stain into the saliva and loosens it so that it can be easily removed by chewing,<br>
brushing or saliva.<br>
In some embodiments, the inventive oral compositions can include a hydroxy fatty<br>
acid salt in combination with other anionic or nonionic surfactants. For example, other<br>
suitable surfactants may include the following anionic or non-ionic surfactants: sulfated<br>
butyl oleate, medium and long chain fatty acid esters, sodium oleate, salts of fumaric acid,<br>
potassium glomate, organic acid esters of mono- and diglycerides, stearyl monoglyceridyl<br>
citrate, succistearin, dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate, glycerol tristearate, lecithin, hydroxylated<br>
lecithin, sodium lauryl sulfate, acetylated monoglycerides, succinylated monoglycerides,<br>
monoglyceride citrate, ethoxylated mono- and diglycerides, sorbitan monostearate, calcium<br>
stearyl-2-lactylate, sodium stearyl lactylate, lactylated fatty acid esters of glycerol and<br>
propylene glycerol, glycerol-lactoesters of C8-C24 fatty acids, polyglycerol esters of C8-C-24<br>
fatty acids, propylene glycol alginate, sucrose C8-C24 fatty acid esters, diacetyl tartaric and<br>
citric acid esters of mono- and diglycerides, triacetin, sarcosinate surfactants, isethionate<br>
surfactants, tautate surfactants, pluronics, polyethylene oxide condensates of alkyl phenols,<br><br>
products derived from the condensation of ethylene oxide with the reaction product of<br>
propylene oxide and ethylene diamine, ethylene oxide condensates of aliphatic alcohols, long<br>
chain tertiary amine oxides, long chain tertiary phosphine oxides, long chain dialkyl<br>
sulfoxides and mixtures thereof.<br>
The surfactant (e.g., sodium ricinoleate), alone or in combination with other<br>
surfactants, may be present in oral compositions of the present invention in concentrations of<br>
about 0.001% to about 20% by weight of the total composition. In some embodiments, the<br>
surfactant may be present at about 0.05 to about 10% by weight of the total composition.<br>
Moreover, in some embodiments, the surfactant may be present in amounts of about 0.05 to<br>
about 2% by weight of the total composition.<br>
Chelating Agents<br>
As described above, the oral compositions of the present invention may optionally<br>
include chelating agents. Chelating agents strongly interact with metal ions, such as the<br>
calcium found in the cell walls of mouth bacteria. Chelating agents can also disrupt plaque<br>
by removing calcium from the calcium bridges which help hold this biomass intact.<br>
One group of agents suitable for use as chelating agents in the compositions of the<br>
present invention are polyphosphates. In some embodiments, the chelating agent is a<br>
phosphate salt selected from the following: pyrophosphates, triphosphates, polyphosphates,<br>
polyphosphonates and combinations thereof. The chelating agent can be a dialkali metal<br>
pyrophosphate salt, a tetra alkali polyphosphate salt or a combination thereof. For example,<br>
in some embodiments, the chelating agent can be selected from the following: tetrasodium<br>
pyrophosphate, tetrapotassium pyrophosphate, sodium tripolyphosphate and combinations of<br>
these. Other chelating agents that can be employed in the compositions of the present<br>
invention may include tartaric acid and salts thereof, citric acid and alkali metal citrates and<br>
mixtures thereof.<br>
In some embodiments, the chelating agent is present in amounts of about 0.001 to<br>
about 5% by weight of the inventive oral composition. Furthermore, in some embodiments,<br>
the chelating agent is present in amounts of about 0.5 to about 3% by weight of the oral<br>
composition.<br><br>
Abrasive Agent<br>
In some embodiments, the oral compositions of the present invention include an<br>
abrasive agent. Suitable abrasives include silicas, aluminas, phosphates, carbonates and<br>
combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the abrasive agent is a silica selected from:<br>
precipitated silica, silica gels and combinations thereof. Moreover, in some embodiments the<br>
abrasive agent is selected from the following: calcium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, sodium<br>
metaphosphate, potassium metaphosphate, tricalcium phosphate, dehydrated dicalcium<br>
phosphate and combinations thereof.<br>
The abrasive polishing material contemplated for use in the compositions of the<br>
present invention can be any material which does not excessively abrade dentin. However,<br>
silica dental abrasives have unique benefits of exceptional dental cleaning and polishing<br>
performance without unduly abrading tooth enamel or dentin.<br>
The silica abrasive polishing materials herein, as well as other abrasives, generally<br>
have an average particle size ranging between about 0.1 to about 30 microns, and preferably<br>
from about 5 to about 15 microns. The abrasive can be precipitated silica or silica gels such<br>
as the silica xerogels described in U.S. Patent No. 3,538,230 to Pader, et al. and U.S. Patent<br>
No. 3,862,307 to DiGiulio, both incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. Preferred<br>
are the silica xerogels marketed under the trade name "Syloid" by the W.R. Grace &amp;<br>
Company, Davison Chemical Division. Also preferred are the precipitated silica materials,<br>
such as those marketed by the J.M. Huber Corporation under the trade name "Zeodenf',<br>
particularly the silica carrying the designation "Zeodent 119". The types of silica dental<br>
abrasives useful in the present invention are described in'detail in U.S. Patent No. 4,340,583<br>
to Wason, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Silica abrasives described in U.S.<br>
Patent Application Serial Nos. 08/434,147 and 08/434,149, both filed May 2,1995, are also<br>
herein incorporated by reference.<br>
In some embodiments, the abrasive is present in amounts from about 0.1 to about 30%<br>
by weight of the oral composition. The abrasive agent may be more typically employed in<br>
amounts from about 0.5 to about 5% by weight of the total composition. The abrasive in the<br>
toothpaste compositions of this invention is generally present at a level of from about 0.5% to<br>
about 10% by weight of the composition. Moreover, inventive chewing gum may contain,<br>
from about 1% to about 6% of abrasive, by weight of the oral composition.<br><br>
The silica used to prepare a chewing gum composition of the present invention is<br>
differentiated by means of its oil absorption value, having oil absorption value of less than<br>
100 cc/lOOg, and preferably in the range of from 45 cc/lOOg silica to less than 70 cc/lOOg<br>
silica. Silica particularly useful in the practice of the present invention is marketed.under the<br>
trade designation SYLODENT XWA GRACE Davison Co., Columbia, DS 21044. An<br>
example of such silica is SYLODENT XWA 150, a silica precipitate having a water content<br>
of 4.7% by weight averaging from about 7 to about 11 microns in diameter, having an<br>
Einlehner Hardness of 5, a BET surface area of 390 m.sup.2/g of silica, an oil absorption of<br>
less than 70 cm.sup.3/100g of silica. This silica exhibits low abrasiveness to tooth enamel.<br>
The silica abrasive can be used as the sole abrasive in preparing a chewing gum of the<br>
present invention or in combination with other known abrasives or pohshing agents,<br>
including calcium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, sodium metaphosphate, potassium<br>
metaphosphate, tricalcium phosphate, dehydrated dicalcium phosphate, or other siliceous<br>
materials, or combinations thereof.<br>
In some embodiments, the total quantity of abrasive silica present in a chewing gum<br>
composition of the present invention is at a concentration of from about 0.1 to about 20% by<br>
weight. Moreover, in some embodiments, the total quantity of abrasive silica present in a<br>
chewing gum composition of the present invention is from about 0.5% to about 5% by<br>
weight.<br>
Orally Acceptable Carrier<br>
The compositions of the present invention include an orally acceptable carrier, in an<br>
appropriate amount to accommodate the other components of the formulation. The term<br>
"orally acceptable carrier" refers to a vehicle capable of being mixed with the active<br>
components for delivery to the oral cavity for tooth whitening and cleaning purposes, and<br>
which will not cause harm to warm-blooded animals, including humans. The orally<br>
acceptable carriers further include those components of the composition that are capable of<br>
being comingled without interaction in a manner which would substantially reduce the<br>
composition's stability and/or efficacy for dental stain-removal in the oral cavity of warm-<br>
blooded animals, including humans, in. accordance with the compositions and methods of the<br>
present invention.<br><br>
The orally acceptable carriers of the present invention can include one or more<br>
compatible solid or liquid filler diluents or encapsulating substances, which are suitable for<br>
oral administration. The carriers or excipients employed in the present invention may be in<br>
any form appropriate to the mode of delivery, for example, solutions, colloidal dispersions,<br>
emulsions, suspensions, rinses, gels, foams, powders, solids, and the like, and can include<br>
conventional components of toothpastes (including gels), mouthwashes and rinses, mouth<br>
sprays, chewing gums, lozenges, and confectionaries. Carriers suitable for the preparation of<br>
compositions of the present invention are well known in the art. Their selection will depend<br>
on secondary considerations like taste, cost, shelf stability and the like.<br>
Types of additives or ingredients, which may be included in the present compositions<br>
include one or more desirable stain-removing agents as provided herein. The inventive<br>
compositions may also include a component selected from the following: elastomers,<br>
elastomer solvents, waxes, emulsifiers, plasticizers, softeners, dispersing agents, sweeteners,<br>
flavorants, humectants, active agents, cooling agents, warming agents, tooth whitening<br>
agents, colorants, bulking agents, fillers and combinations thereof.<br>
In some embodiments, an active agent can be a fluoride compound or an antibacterial<br>
compound. For example, a known antibacterial compound is triclosan.<br>
Moreover, in some embodiments a film-forming polymer may be included in the<br>
compositions of the present invention. For example, the film-forming polymer may be a<br>
synthetic anionic polymeric polycarboxylate (SAPP), such a PVM/MA copolymer (Gantrez<br>
S-97, GAF Corp.). Such polymers are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,334,375 and<br>
5,505,933, which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. SAPP's have<br>
previously been described as being useful for dentin sensitivity reduction. Moreover, SAPP's<br>
have previously been described as antibacterial-enhancing agents, which enhance delivery of<br>
an antibacterial agent to oral surfaces, and which enhance the retention of the antibacterial<br>
agent on oral surfaces. It is well within the contemplation of the present invention that film-<br>
forming polymers, such as PVM/MA copolymer, maybe employed in the compositions of<br>
the present invention as a means of reducing stain formation.<br>
As described above, in some embodiments, the inventive composition may be a gum<br>
composition including a gum base and a surfactant, which comprises a fatty acid salt having<br><br>
at least one hydroxyl functionality. In some embodiments, the surfactant is the hydroxy fatty<br>
acid salt of ricinoleic acid.<br>
Gum compositions according to the present invention may further include a chelator,<br>
such as a polyphosphate. Suitable examples are the same as those described above.<br>
Moreover, gum compositions of the present invention may include abrasives, suitable<br>
examples of which are the same as those described above. For example, in one specific<br>
embodiment, the abrasive in the gum is a silica abrasive. A useful silica is one having an oil<br>
absorption value of less than 100 cc/100 g silica, and preferably in the range of from 45<br>
cc/100 g silica to less than 70 cc/100 g silica. A suitable silica is sold under the name<br>
SYLODENT XWA (Davison Co., Columbia, MD).<br>
In addition to the hydroxy fatty acid salts, it is also well within the contemplation of<br>
the present invention that the inventive gum compositions may further include other anionic<br>
or nonionic surfactants. Suitable examples are the same as those described above. These<br>
may be included within the gum base, for example.<br>
The gum base may be present in an amount of about 20 to about 40% by weight of the<br>
total composition. It may include any component known in the chewing gum art. For<br>
example, the gum base may include sweeteners, elastomers, bulking agents, waxes, elastomer<br>
solvents, emulsifiers, plasticizers, fillers, mixtures thereof and may include a desirable stain-<br>
removing agent(s) as provided herein.<br>
In some embodiments, the gum base may include a suitable sugar bulking agent. For<br>
example, the gum base may include a specific polyol composition including at least one<br>
polyol which is from about 30% to about 80% by weight of the gum base, and desirably from<br>
50% to about 60%. The polyol composition may include any polyol known in the art<br>
including, but not limited to maltitol, sorbitol, erythritol, xylitol, mannitol, isomalt, lactitol<br>
and combinations thereof. Lycasin which is a hydrogenated starch hydrolysate including<br>
sorbitol and maltitol, may also be used.<br>
Maltitol is a sweet, water-soluble sugar alcohol useful as a bulking agent in the<br>
preparation of beverages and foodstuffs and is more fully described in U.S. Pat. No.<br><br>
3,708,396, which disclosure is incorporated herein by reference. Maltitol is made by<br>
hydrogenation of maltose which is the most common reducing disaccharide and is found in<br>
starch and other natural products.<br>
The polyol composition which may include one or more different polyols which may<br>
be derived from a genetically modified organism ("GMO") or GMO free source. For<br>
example, the maltitol may be GMO free maltitol or provided by a hydrogenated starch<br>
hydrolysate.<br>
Some embodiments may include a polyol composition including maltitol which has a<br>
greater crystalline density than sorbitol. Other polyols which exhibit a greater crystalline<br>
density than sorbitol include xylitol and mannitol. Polyols of a greater crystalline density<br>
may be useful in center-fill gums. Specifically, a polyol of a greater crystalline density<br>
results in a structure with fewer pores, which provides less surface area for potential moisture<br>
or fluid migration into the gum region from the liquid-fill.<br>
The polyol composition may also have a sweetness of greater than about 50% of the<br>
sweetness of sucrose. Also, the polyol composition of some embodiments has a solubility of<br>
less than 67% by weight at 25Â°C and greater than about 18% by weight at 25Â°C<br>
The polyol composition may include particles of a variety of sizes. Specifically, the<br>
average particle size of the polyol composition ranges from about 30 microns to about 600<br>
microns, more specifically from about 30 microns to about 200 microns.<br>
The elastomers (rubbers) employed in the gum base will vary greatly depending upon<br>
various factors such as the type of gum. base desired, the consistency of gum composition<br>
desired and the other components used in the composition to make the final chewing gum<br>
product. The elastomer may be any water-insoluble polymer known in the art, and includes<br>
those gum polymers utilized for chewing gums and bubble gums. Illustrative examples of<br>
suitable polymers in gum bases include both natural and synthetic elastomers. For example,<br>
those polymers which are suitable in gum base compositions include, without limitation,<br>
natural substances (of vegetable origin) such as chicle, natural rubber, crown gum, nispero,<br>
rosidinha, jelutong, perillo, niger gutta, tunu, balata, guttapercha, lechi capsi, sorva, gutta kay,<br>
and the like, and mixtures thereof. Examples of synthetic elastomers include, without<br><br>
limitation, styrene-butadiene copolymers (SBR), polyisobutylene, isobutylene-isoprene<br>
copolymers, polyethylene, polyvinyl acetate and the like, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The amount of elastomer employed in the gum base may vary depending upon<br>
various factors such as the type of gum base used, the consistency of the gum composition<br>
desired and the other components used in the composition to make the final chewing gum<br>
product. In general, the elastomer will be present in the gum base in an amount from about<br>
10% to about 60% by weight of the gum region, desirably from about 35% to about 40% by<br>
weight.<br>
When a wax is present in the gum base, it softens the polymeric elastomer mixture<br>
and improves the elasticity of the gum base. The waxes employed will have a melting point<br>
below about 60Â°C, and preferably between about 45Â°C. and about 55Â°C. The low melting<br>
wax may be a paraffin wax. The wax may be present in the gum base in an amount from<br>
about 6% to about 10%, and preferably from about 7% to about 9.5%, by weight of the gum<br>
base.<br>
In addition to the low melting point waxes, waxes having a higher melting point may<br>
be used in the gum base in amounts up to about 5%, by weight of the gum base. Such high<br>
melting waxes include beeswax, vegetable wax, candelilla wax, carnuba wax, most petroleum<br>
waxes, and the like, and mixtures thereof.<br>
In addition to the components set out above, the gum base may include a variety of<br>
other ingredients, such as components selected from elastomer solvents, emulsifiers,<br>
plasticizers, fillers, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The gum base may contain elastomer solvents to aid in softening the elastomer<br>
component. Such elastomer solvents may include those elastomer solvents known in the art,<br>
for example, terpinene resins such as polymers of alpha-pinene or beta-pinene, methyl,<br>
glycerol and pentaerythritol esters of rosins and modified rosins and gums such as<br>
hydrogenated, dimerized and polymerized rosins, and mixtures thereof. Examples of<br>
elastomer solvents suitable for use herein may include the pentaerythritol ester of partially<br>
hydrogenated wood and gum rosin, the pentaerythritol ester of wood and gum rosin, the<br>
glycerol ester of wood rosin, the glycerol ester of partially dimerized wood and gum rosin,<br><br>
the glycerol ester of polymerized wood and gum rosin, the glycerol ester of tall oil rosin, the<br>
glycerol ester of wood and gum rosin and the partially hydrogenated wood and gum rosin and<br>
the partially hydrogenated methyl ester of wood and rosin, and the like, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The elastomer solvent may be employed in the gum base in amounts from about 2% to about<br>
15%, and preferably from about 7% to about 11%, by weight of the gum base.<br>
The gum base may also include emulsifiers which aid in dispersing any immiscible<br>
components into a single stable system. The emulsifiers useful in this invention include<br>
glyceryl monostearate, lecithin, fatty acid monoglycerides, diglycerides, propylene glycol<br>
monostearate, and the like, and mixtures thereof. The emulsifier may be employed in<br>
amounts from about 2% to about 15%, and more specifically, from about 7% to about 11%,<br>
by weight of the gum base.<br>
The gum base may also include plasticizers or softeners to provide a variety of<br>
desirable textures and consistency properties. Because of the low molecular weight of these<br>
ingredients, the plasticizers and softeners are able to penetrate the fundamental structure of<br>
the gum base making it plastic and less viscous. Useful plasticizers and softeners include<br>
lanolin, palmitic acid, oleic acid, stearic acid, sodium stearate, potassium stearate, glyceryl<br>
triacetate, glyceryl lecithin, glyceryl monostearate, propylene glycol monostearate, acetylated<br>
monoglyceride, glycerine, and the like, and mixtures thereof. Waxes, for example, natural<br>
and synthetic waxes, hydrogenated vegetable oils, petroleum waxes such as polyurethane<br>
waxes, polyethylene waxes, paraffin waxes, microcrystalline waxes, fatty waxes, sorbitan<br>
monostearate, tallow, propylene glycol, mixtures thereof, and the like, may also be<br>
incorporated into the gum base. The plasticizers and softeners are generally employed in the<br>
gum base in amounts up to about 20% by weight of the gum base, and more specifically in<br>
amounts from about 9% to about 17%, by weight of the gum base.<br>
Plasticizers also include are the hydrogenated vegetable oils and include soybean oil<br>
and cottonseed oil which may be employed alone or in combination. These plasticizers<br>
provide the gum base with good texture and soft chew characteristics. These plasticizers and<br>
softeners are generally employed in amounts from about 5% to about 14%, and more<br>
specifically in amounts from about 5% to about 13.5%, by weight of the gum base.<br><br>
Anhydrous glycerin may also be employed as a softening agent, such as the<br>
commercially available United States Pharmacopeia (USP) grade. Glycerin is a syrupy liquid<br>
with a sweet warm taste and has a sweetness of about 60% of that of cane sugar. Because<br>
glycerin is hygroscopic, the anhydrous glycerin maybe maintained under anhydrous<br>
conditions throughout the preparation of the chewing gum composition.<br>
Although softeners maybe present to modify the texture of the gum composition, they<br>
may be present in reduced amounts as compared to typical gum compositions. For example,<br>
they may be present from about 0.5 to about 10% by weight based on the total weight of the<br>
composition, or they may not be present in the composition, since the surfactant active can<br>
act as a softener.<br>
The gum base of this invention may also include effective amounts of bulking agents<br>
such as mineral adjuvants which may serve as fillers and textural agents. Useful mineral<br>
adjuvants include calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate, durnina, aluminum hydroxide,<br>
aluminum silicate, talc, tricalcium phosphate, dicalcium phosphate, calcium sulfate and the<br>
like, and mixtures thereof. These fillers or adjuvants maybe used in the gum base<br>
compositions in various amounts. Preferably the amount of filler, when used, will be present<br>
in an amount from about 15% to about 40%, and desirably from about 20% to about 30%, by<br>
weight of the gum base.<br>
A variety of traditional ingredients may be optionally included in the gum base in<br>
effective amounts such as coloring agents, antioxidants, preservatives, flavoring agents, and<br>
the like. For example, titanium dioxide and other dyes suitable for food, drug and cosmetic<br>
applications, known as F. D. &amp; C. dyes, may be utilized. An anti-oxidant such as butylated<br>
hydroxytoluene (BHT), butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), propyl gallate, and mixtures<br>
thereof, may also be included. Other conventional chewing gum additives known to one<br>
having ordinary skill in the chewing gum art may also be used in the gum base.<br>
Some embodiments extend to methods of making the gum compositions. The manner<br>
in which the gum base components are mixed is not critical and is performed using standard<br>
techniques and apparatus known to those skilled in the art. In a typical method, an elastomer<br>
is admixed with an elastomer solvent and/or a plasticizer and/or an emulsifier and agitated for<br>
a period of from 1 to 30 minutes. The remaining ingredients, such as the low melting point<br><br>
wax, are then admixed, either in bulk or incrementally, while the gum base mixture is<br>
blended again for 1 to 30 minutes.<br>
The gum composition may include amounts of conventional additives selected from,<br>
but not limited to, the following: sweetening agents (sweeteners), plasticizers, softeners,<br>
emulsifiers, waxes, fillers, bulking agents (carriers, extenders, bulk sweeteners), mineral<br>
adjuvants, flavoring agents (flavors, flavorings), coloring agents (colorants, colorings),<br>
antioxidants, acidulants, thickeners, medicaments, and the like, and mixtures thereof. Some<br>
of these additives may serve more than one purpose. For example, in sugarless gum<br>
compositions, a sweetener, such as maltitol or other sugar alcohol, may also function as a<br>
bulking agent.<br>
The plasticizers, softening agents, mineral adjuvants, waxes and antioxidants<br>
discussed above, as being suitable for use in the gum base, may also be used in the chewing<br>
gum composition. Examples of other conventional additives which may be used include<br>
emulsifiers, such as lecithin and glyceryl monostearate, thickeners, used alone or in<br>
combination with other softeners, such as methyl cellulose, alginates, carrageenan, xanthan<br>
gum, gelatin, carob, tragacanth, locust bean, and carboxy methyl cellulose, acidulants such as<br>
malic acid, adipic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, fumaric acid, and mixtures thereof, and<br>
fillers, such as those discussed above under the category of mineral adjuvants.<br>
In some embodiments, the gum region may also contain a bulking agent. Suitable<br>
bulking agents may be water-soluble and include sweetening agents selected from, but not<br>
limited to, monosaccharides, disaccharides, polysaccharides, sugar alcohols, and mixtures<br>
thereof; randomly bonded glucose polymers such as those polymers distributed under the<br>
tradename POLYDEXTROSE by Pfizer, Inc., Groton, Conn.; isomalt (a racemic mixture of<br>
alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-l,6-mannitol and alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-l,6-sorbitol manufactured<br>
under the tradename PALATINIT by Suddeutsche Zucker), maltodextrins; hydrogenated<br>
starch hydrolysates; hydrogenated hexoses; hydrogenated disaccharides; minerals, such as<br>
calcium carbonate, talc, titanium dioxide, dicalcium phosphate; celluloses; and mixtures<br>
thereof.<br>
Suitable sugar bulking agents include monosaccharides, disaccharides and<br>
polysaccharides such as xylose, ribulose, glucose (dextrose), mannose, galactose, fructose<br><br>
(levulose), sucrose (sugar), maltose, invert sugar, partially hydrolyzed starch and corn syrup<br>
solids, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Suitable sugar alcohol bulking agents include sorbitol, xylitol, mannitol, galactitol,<br>
maltitol, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Suitable hydrogenated starch hydrolysates include those disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos.<br>
25,959, 3,356,811,4,279,931 and various hydrogenated glucose syrups and/or powders<br>
which contain sorbitol, hydrogenated disaccharides, hydrogenated higher polysaccharides, or<br>
mixtures thereof. Hydrogenated starch hydrolysates are primarily prepared by the controlled<br>
catalytic hydrogenation of corn syrups. The resulting hydrogenated starch hydrolysates are<br>
mixtures of monomelic, dimeric, and polymeric saccharides. The ratios of these different<br>
saccharides give different hydrogenated starch hydrolysates different properties. Mixtures of<br>
hydrogenated starch hydrolysates, such as LYCASIN, a commercially available product<br>
manufactured by Roquette Freres of France, and HYSTAR, a commercially available product'<br>
manufactured by Lonza, Inc., of Fairlawn, N. J., are also useful.<br>
The sweetening agents used may be selected from a wide range of materials including<br>
water-soluble sweeteners, water-soluble artificial sweeteners, water-soluble sweeteners<br>
derived from naturally occurring water-soluble sweeteners, dipeptide based sweeteners, and<br>
protein based sweeteners, including mixtures thereof. Without being limited to particular<br>
sweeteners, representative categories and examples include:<br>
(a)	water-soluble sweetening agents such as dihydrochalcones, monellin, steviosides,<br>
glycyrrhizin, dihydroflavenol, and sugar alcohols such as sorbitol, mannitol, maltitol, and L-<br>
aminodicarboxylic acid aminoalkenoic acid ester amides, such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat.<br>
No. 4,619,834, which disclosure is incorporated herein by reference, and mixtures thereof;<br>

(e)	protein based sweeteners such as thaumaoccous danielli (Thaumatin I and H).<br>
The intense sweetening agents may be used in many distinct physical forms well-<br>
known in the art to provide an initial burst of sweetness and/or a prolonged sensation of<br>
sweetness. Without being limited thereto, such physical forms include free forms, such as<br>
spray dried, powdered, beaded forms, encapsulated forms, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Desirably, the sweetener is a high intensity sweetener such as aspartame, sucralose,<br>
and acesulfame potassium (Ace-K).<br>
In general, an effective amount of sweetener may be utilized to provide the level of<br>
sweetness desired, and this amount may vary with the sweetener selected. The amount of<br>
sweetener may be present in amounts from about 0.001% to about 3%, by weight of the gum<br>
composition, depending upon the sweetener or combination of sweeteners used. The exact<br>
range of amounts for each type of sweetener may be selected by those skilled in the art.<br><br>
The flavoring agents which may be used include those flavors known to the skilled<br>
artisan, such as natural and artificial flavors. These flavorings may be chosen from synthetic<br>
flavor oils and flavoring aromatics and/or oils, oleoresins and extracts derived from plants,<br>
leaves, flowers, fruits, and so forth, and combinations thereof. Nonlimiting representative<br>
flavor oils include spearmint oil, cinnamon oil, oil of wintergreen (methyl salicylate),<br>
peppermint oil, clove oil, bay oil, anise oil, eucalyptus oil, thyme oil, cedar leaf oil, oil of<br>
nutmeg, allspice, oil of sage, mace, oil of bitter almonds, and cassia oil. Also useful<br>
flavorings are artificial, natural and synthetic fruit flavors such as vanilla, and citrus oils<br>
including lemon, orange, lime, grapefruit, and fruit essences including apple, pear, peach,<br>
grape, strawberry, raspberry, cherry, plum, pineapple, apricot and so forth. These flavoring<br>
agents may be used in liquid or solid form and may be used individually or in admixture.<br>
Commonly used flavors include mints such as peppermint, menthol, spearmint, artificial<br>
vanilla, cinnamon derivatives, and various fruit flavors, whether employed individually or in<br>
admixture.<br>
Other useful flavorings include aldehydes and esters such as cinnamyl acetate,<br>
cinnamaldehyde, citral diethylacetal, dihydrocarvyl acetate, eugenyl formate, p-<br>
methylamisol, and so forth may be used. Generally any flavoring or food additive such as<br>
those described in Chemicals Used in Food Processing, publication 1274, pages 63-258, by<br>
the National Academy of Sciences, may be used. This publication is incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
Further examples of aldehyde flavorings include but are not limited to acetaldehyde<br>

In some embodiments, the flavoring agent may be employed in either liquid form<br>
and/or dried form. When employed in the latter form, suitable drying means such as spray<br>
drying the oil may be used. Alternatively, the flavoring agent may be absorbed onto water<br>
soluble materials, such as cellulose, starch, sugar, maltodextrin, gum arabic and so forth or<br>
may be encapsulated. The actual techniques for preparing such dried forms are well-known.<br>
In some embodiments, the flavoring agents may be used in many distinct physical<br>
forms well-known in the art to provide an initial burst of flavor and/or a prolonged sensation<br>
of flavor. Without being limited thereto, such physical forms include free forms, such as<br>
spray dried, powdered, beaded forms, encapsulated forms, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The amount of flavoring agent employed herein may be a matter of preference subject<br>
to such factors as the type of final chewing gum composition, the individual flavor, the gum<br>
base employed, and the strength of flavor desired. Thus, the amount of flavoring may be<br>
varied in order to obtain the result desired in the final product and such variations are within<br>
the capabilities of those skilled in the art without the need for undue experimentation. In gum<br>
compositions, the flavoring agent is generally present in amounts from about 0.02% to about<br>
5%, and more specifically from about 0.1% to about 2%, and even more specifically, from<br>
about 0.8% to about 1.8%, by weight of the chewing gum composition.<br>
Coloring agents may be used in amounts effective to produce the desired color. The<br>
coloring agents may include pigments which may be incorporated in amounts up to about<br>
6%, by weight of the gum composition. For example, titanium dioxide may be incorporated<br>
in amounts up to about 2%, and preferably less than about 1%, by weight of the gum<br>
composition. The colorants may also include natural food colors and dyes suitable for food,<br>
drug and cosmetic applications. These colorants are known as F.D.&amp; C. dyes and lakes. The<br>
materials acceptable for the foregoing uses are preferably water-soluble. Illustrative<br>
nonlimiting examples include the indigoid dye known as F.D.&amp; C. Blue No.2, which is the<br>
disodium salt of 5,5-indigotindisulfonic acid. Similarly, the dye known as F.D.&amp; C. Green<br>
No.l comprises a rriphenylmethane dye and is the monosodium salt of 4-[4-(N-ethyl-p-<br>
sulfomumbenzylarrmio)diphenylmethylene]-[1-(N-ethyl-N-p-sulfoniumbenzyl)-delta-2,5-<br>
cyclohexadieneimine]. A full recitation of all F.D.&amp; C. colorants and their corresponding<br>
chemical structures may be found in the Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology,<br><br>
3rd Edition, in volume 5 at pages 857-884, which text is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Suitable oils and fats usable in gum compositions include partially hydrogenated<br>
vegetable or animal fats, such as coconut oil, palm kernel oil, beef tallow, and lard, among<br>
others. These ingredients when used are generally present in amounts up to about 7%, and<br>
preferably up to about 3.5%, by weight of the gum composition.<br>
Some embodiments may include a method for preparing the gum compositions,<br>
including both chewing gum and bubble gum compositions. The chewing gum compositions<br>
may be prepared using standard techniques and equipment known to those skilled in the art.<br>
The apparatus useful in accordance with some embodiments comprises mixing and heating<br>
apparatus well known in the chewing gum manufacturing arts, and therefore the selection of<br>
the specific apparatus will be apparent to the artisan.<br>
Li some embodiments, a method of preparing a stain-removing gum composition<br>
includes heating a gum base to soften the base and then mixing the softened gum base with a<br>
fatty acid salt having at least one hydroxyl functionality so as to obtain a substantially<br>
homogeneous mixture. The method further includes cooling the mixture and forming the<br>
cooled mixture into individual gum pieces. The hydroxy fatty acid salt may be a salt of<br>
ricinoleic acid, such as sodium ricinoleate. Further ingredients may be mixed into the<br>
softened gum base. For example, one or more of the following may typically be added:<br>
bulking agent, filler, humectant, flavorant, colorant, dispersing agent, softener, plasticizer,<br>
preservative, warming agent, cooling agent, tooth whitening agent and sweetener.<br>
In some embodiments, gum pieces may be coated with an aqueous coating<br>
composition, which may be applied by any method known in the art. The coating<br>
composition may be present in an amount from about 25% to about 35% by weight of the<br>
total gum piece, more specifically about 30% by weight of the gum piece.<br>
The outer coating may be hard or crunchy. Typically, the outer coating may include<br>
sorbitol, maltitol, xylitol, isomalt, and other crystallizable polyols; sucrose may also be used.<br>
Flavors may also be added to yield unique product characteristics. Moreover, the outer<br>
coating may include one or more of the stain-removing agents provided herein.<br><br>
The coating, if present, may include several opaque layers, such that the chewing gum<br>
composition is not visible through the coating itself, which can optionally be covered with a<br>
further one or more transparent layers for aesthetic, textural and protective purposes. The<br>
outer coating may also contain small amounts of water and gum arabic. The coating can be<br>
further coated with wax. The coating may be applied in a conventional manner by successive<br>
applications of a coating solution, with drying in between each coat. As the coating dries it<br>
usually becomes opaque and is usually white, though other colorants may be added. A polyol<br>
coating can be further coated with wax. The coating can further include colored flakes or<br>
speckles.<br>
If the composition comprises a coating, it is possible that one or more oral care actives<br>
can be dispersed throughout the coating. This may be preferred if one or more oral care<br>
actives is incompatible in a single phase composition with another of the actives.<br>
Moreover, it is well within the contemplation of the present invention that providing<br>
one or more of the stain-removing agents in the coating can enhance the stain-removing<br>
efficacy of the total composition. For example, as described above, the mechanical abrasion<br>
may be initially enhanced by providing the abrasive in the coating layer. Chemical cleaning<br>
effects are also enhanced as a result.<br>
Furthermore, the hydroxy fatty acid salt can be included in one or more of the<br>
chewing gum regions such as the coating, the gum base or both. Additionally, the hydroxy<br>
fatty acid salt can be added at different stages of the manufacture, alone or as a premix with<br>
other components. For example, in some embodiments, the method for preparing a stain-<br>
removing gum composition includes heating a gum base to soften the base; and mixing the<br>
softened gum base with at least one of the following: elastomer, wax, emulsifier, bulking<br>
agent, filler, humectant, flavorant, colorant, dispersing agent, softener, plasticizer,<br>
preservative, warming agent, cooling agent, tooth whitening agent and sweetener to obtain a<br>
substantially homogeneous mixture. The method also involves cooling the mixture; forming<br>
the cooled mixture into individual gum pieces; and coating the gum pieces with an aqueous<br>
coating solution including a fatty acid salt having at least one hydroxyl functionality. The<br>
hydroxy fatty acid salt may be a salt of ricinoleic acid. One or more other ingredients may be<br>
included in the coating composition, such as including, but not limited to, the following: gum<br>
arabic, flavorant, colorant, sweetener, bulking agent, filler, anti-adherent compound,<br><br>
dispersing agent, moisture absorbing compound, warming agent, cooling agent and film-<br>
forming agent.<br>
The coating may be formulated to assist with increasing the thermal stability of the<br>
gum piece and preventing leaking of a liquid fill if the gum product is a center-filled gum. In<br>
some embodiments, the coating may include a gelatin composition. The gelatin composition<br>
may be added as a 40% by weight solution and may be present in the coating composition<br>
from about 5% to about 10% by weight of the coating composition, and more specifically<br>
about 7% to about 8%. The gel strength of the gelatin may be from about 130 bloom to about<br>
250 bloom.<br>
Additives, such as physiological cooling agents, throat-soothing agents, spices,<br>
warming agents, tooth-whitening agents, breath-freshening agents, vitamins minerals,<br>
caffeine, drugs and other actives may be included in any or all portions of the chewing gum<br>
composition. Such components may be used in amounts sufficient to achieve their intended<br>
effects.<br>
With respect to cooling agents, a variety of well known cooling agents may be<br>
employed. For example, among the useful cooling agents are included menthol, xylitol,<br>
menthane, menthone, menthyl acetate, menthyl salicylate, N,2,3-trimethyl-2-isopropyl<br>
butanamide (WS-23), N-ethyl-p-menthane-3-carboxamide (WS-3), menthyl succinate, 3,1-<br>
menthoxypropane 1,2-diol, among others. These and other suitable cooling agents are further<br>
described in the following U.S. patents, all of which are incorporated in their entirety by<br>
reference hereto: U.S. 4,230,688 and 4,032,661 to Rowsell et al.; 4,459,425 to Amano et al.;<br>
4,136,163 to Watson et al.; and 5,266,592 to Grub et al. These cooling agents maybe present<br>
in one or more of the outer gum coatings, the gum region surrounding the liquid fill, the<br>
liquid fill per se, or in any combination of those three gum areas. Cooling agents, when used<br>
in the outer coating composition for the gum, are generally present in amount of 0.01 % to<br>
about 1.0%. When used in the other portions of the gum, such as the gum region or the<br>
center fill, they may be present in amounts of about 0.001 to about 10% by weight of the total<br>
chewing gum'piece.<br>
Warming components may be selected from a wide variety of compounds known to<br>
provide the sensory signal of warming to the user. These compounds offer the perceived<br><br>
sensation of warmth, particularly in the oral cavity, and often enhance the perception of<br>
flavors, sweeteners and other organoleptic components. Among the useful warming<br>
compounds included are vanillyl alcohol n-butylether (TK-1000) supplied by Takasago<br>
Perfurnary Company Limited, Tokyo, Japan, vanillyl alcohol n-propylether, vanillyl alcohol<br>
isopropylether, vanillyl alcohol isobutylether, vanillyl alcohol n-aminoether, vanillyl alcohol<br>
isoamyleather, vanillyl alcohol n-hexyleather, vanillyl alcohol methylether, vanillyl alcohol<br>
ethyleather, gingerol, shogaol, paradol, zingerone, capsaicin, dihydrocapsaicin,<br>
nordihydrocapsaicin, homocapsaicin, homodihydrocapsaicin, ethanol, isopropol alcohol, iso-<br>
amylalcohol, benzyl alcohol, glycerine, and combinations thereof.<br>
The features and advantages of the present invention are more fully shown by the<br>
following examples which are provided for purposes of illustration, and are not to be<br>
construed as limiting the invention in any way.<br><br>
EXAMPLES<br><br>
Experimental<br>
Chewing gum compositions A, B, C, D and E shown in Table 1 above and Table 2<br>
below were prepared by conventional methods. Compositions A, B and C are comparative<br>
compositions; and compositions D and E are compositions of the present invention. The<br>
method of preparing the compositions involved heating a gum base sufficiently to soften the<br>
base without adversely affecting the physical and chemical make-up of the base. The molten<br>
gum base and fillers were then added to the mixing kettle. The sugar alcohols, glycerin,<br>
flavor, sweeteners, chelating agent, abrasive and surfactant (sodium ricinoleate or sodium<br><br>
stearate) were added with mixing to obtain a substantially homogeneous mixture, with the<br>
surfactant component added last. The mixture was then discharged from the mixing kettle<br>
and rolled and scored into a desired piece by conventional techniques.<br>
To evaluate the whitening efficacy of Chewing Gums A, B, C, D and E, a mechanical<br>
instrument, which was developed by Kleber et al.1 to simulate the human mastication of<br>
chewing gum, was used. For testing, a specimen block with one enamel square was placed in<br>
both the upper and lower tooth holders of the instrument. 15 ml of freshly prepared modified<br>
artificial human saliva2 (no amino acid was added) was placed in the reservoir and<br>
approximately 3 grams of the test chewing gum (i.e. 2 pellets) was placed between the<br>
repositioning paddles directly over the lower tooth specimens. Then the mastication motor<br>
was started and the chewing gums were chewed for 60 minutes.<br>
Stained bovine teeth were prepared by Indiana-Purdue University. The average<br>
L*a*b* color scores for the extrinsic stain on the teeth at baseline were well balanced for<br>
each color factor before treatment. All bovine teeth used in this experiment had a value of<br>
AE
Squares of dental enamel 4 mm on a side were cut, using a diamond cutting disk, from<br>
bovine permanent incisors. Using a mold, four of the enamel squares were embedded in clear<br>
polyester casting resin to provide 1.5 cm square blocks with the labial surfaces exposed. The<br>
top surface of the polyester blocks were ground flush with the leveled labial surfaces of the<br>
enamel squares by means of a dental model trimmer. The surface was then smoothed by<br>
hand-sanding on 400 grit emery paper using water as the lubricant until all grinding marks<br>
were removed. Finally, the top surface of the blocks was hand-polished to a mirror finish<br>
using a water slurry of GK1072 calcined kaolin (median particle size = 1.2 microns) on a<br>
cotton cloth. The finished specimens were examined under a dissecting microscope and<br>
discarded if surface imperfections were observed.<br>
In order to render the polished tooth surfaces more similar to natural teeth and<br>
promote the formation of stain on the enamel, the specimens were etched for 60 seconds in<br>

gums. J. Dent Res 60:109-114,1981.<br>

0.2 M HC1 followed by a final etch with. 1% phytic acid for 60 seconds. Theii the specimens<br>
were rinsed with deionized water and attached to the staining apparatus.<br>
The tooth staining apparatus was designed to provide alternate immersion into the<br>
staining broth and air-drying of the specimens. The apparatus consisted of an aluminum<br>
platform base which supported a Teflon rod (3/4-inch in diameter) connected to an electric<br>
motor, which by means of a speed reduction box, rotated the rod at a constant rate of 1.5 rpm.<br>
Threaded screw holes were spaced at regular intervals along the length of the rod. The tooth<br>
specimens were attached to the rod by first gluing the head of a plastic screw to the back of<br>
the specimen, then screwing the tooth onto the rod. Beneath the rod was a removable 300 ml<br>
capacity trough which held the tooth staining broth.<br>
The staining broth was prepared by adding 1.02 g of instant coffee, 1.02 g of instant<br>
tea, and 0.75 g of gastric mucin to 250 ml of sterilized trypticase soy broth. Approximately<br>
50 ml of a 24-hour stain-promoting Micrococcus luteus culture was also added to the stain<br>
broth. The apparatus, with the enamel specimens attached and the staining broth in the<br>
trough, was then placed in an incubator at 37Â°C with the specimens rotating continuously<br>
through the staining broth and air. The staining broth was replaced once every 24 hours for<br>
ten consecutive days. With each broth change, the trough and specimens were rinsed and<br>
tooth brushed with deionized water to remove any loose deposits. On the eleventh day, the<br>
staining broth was modified by the addition of 0.03 g of FeCl3 6H2O, and this was continued<br>
with daily broth changes until the stain on the specimens was sufficiently dark (L*
Then, the specimens were removed from the staining broth, brushed thoroughly with<br>
deionized water, and refrigerated in a humidor until used.<br>
Procedures<br>
In preparation for treatment, the baseline L*a*b* stain scores of the tooth specimens<br>
were determined and used to stratify the teeth into balanced groups of 8 specimens each. A<br>
mechanical instrument with a flow system to simulate the human mastication was used to<br>
treat the tooth specimens with the test chewing gum. For testing, a specimen block with<br>
enamel squares was placed in both the upper and lower tooth holders of the instrument.<br>
An artificial saliva (pH 7.3) was placed in the reservoir. Approximately 1.5 grams of<br>
test chewing gum (i.e. 2 tablets) was placed between the repositioning paddles directly over<br><br>
the lower tooth specimen. Then the mastication motor was started and the two specimen<br>
blocks with the enamel squares were treated with the chewing gums for 5 minutes. This<br>
treatment procedure was repeated for 12 consecutive times (a total of 60 minutes of<br>
treatment) in order to simulate 4 times/day usage for 3 days. Fresh gums and artificial saliva<br>
were used for each 5-minute treatment period. Following the 12th treatments, the specimens<br>
were rinsed, allowed to dry for 30 minutes, and color reading made. After the final stain<br>
measurements, the specimens were pumiced using a dental hand piece in order to clean all<br>
residual stain off of the teeth, then color readings were taken again. This final procedure<br>
provided a value for each specimen that: represented the maximum amount of stain that<br>
potentially could be removed by the test chewing gum or the saliva.<br>
The color of the extrinsic stain on the bovine teeth was measured by taking diffuse<br>
reflectance absorbance readings with a Minolta spectrophotometer. Absorbance<br>
measurement over the entire visible color spectrum were obtained using the CIELAB color<br>
scale. This scale quantifies color according to 3 parameters, L* (lightness-darkness scale); a*<br>
(red-green chroma); and b* (yellow-blue chroma). In order to obtain reproducible readings,<br>
, the stained enamel specimens were allowed to air-dry at room temperature for 60 minutes<br>
before measurements were made. Measurements were conducted by aligning the center of<br>
the 4 mm square segment of stained enamel directly over the 3 mm diameter targeting<br>
aperture of the Minolta spectrophotometer. An average of 3 absorbance readings using the<br>
L*a*b* scale were taken for each specimen.<br>
The overall change in the color of the stained teeth was calculated using the CIELAB<br>
equation AE = [(ÎL*)2 + (Îa*)2 + (Îb*)2]l/2. The individual components of the L*a*b* scale<br>
represent the specific changes in the whiteness (L*), red-green color (a*), and yellow-blue<br>
color (b*). The ÎE (i.e., dE) value for each composition tested is shown in Table 2 below,<br>
and summarizes the overall change for each color factor (ÎL*, Îa*, and Îb*). This value<br>
represents the ability of a test chewing gum to remove stain and whiten teeth, wherein the<br>
greater the number, the better its ability to remove stains and whiten teeth.<br><br><br>
As shown in Table 2, Inventive Compositions D and E were able to remove stains and<br>
whiten teeth better than the comparative Compositions A, B and C.<br>
Example 2 - Coated Chewing Gum Composition - Surfactant in the Coat<br><br>
In the present example, the hydroxy fatty acid surfactant (sodium ricinoleate) is in the<br>
coat. An inventive gum composition is prepared by conventional methods to form<br>
Composition F in. Table 3. Briefly, a gum base is softened with heating. The molten gum<br>
base and filler are added to the mixing kettle and mixing is commenced. The sugar alcohols,<br>
glycerin, chelating agent (sodium tripolyhosphate), abrasive agent (silicon dioxide), flavors<br>
and high intensity sweetener mixture, are added m portions to obtain a substantially<br><br>
homogeneous mixture. The mixture is then discharged from the mixing kettle, and formed<br>
into cores by conventional techniques.<br>
The cores are placed into a coating pan and broken into individual pieces as<br>
necessary. A sugarless solution containing 70% by weight of maltitol, as well as titanium<br>
dioxide, gum arable and water is heated to between 70Â°C and 80Â°C. The solution is sprayed<br>
onto the gum core pieces in layers and allowed to dry between sprays while the coating pan is<br>
continually rotating to ensure a smooth even coat of the gum cores.<br>
The coating is built up to about 8% by weight of the final pellet weight. Ace-K is<br>
then added and men covered with another layer of the above-mentioned coating solution and<br>
then allowed to dry.<br>
After the high intensity sweetener layer is dried, sodium ricinoleate and a flavorant<br>
are added in alternating layers until all of the respective materials are added with each layer<br>
being allowed to dry before the next layer is applied. The coating process is continued with<br>
the coating solution until the coat comprises 24% by weight of the final pellet weight. .<br>
The coating is then topped with a conventional finishing solution until a shell weight<br>
of 25% by weight is obtained. The pellets are then polished in a polishing pan with candelilla<br>
wax in a conventional manner.<br><br>
Example 3 - Coated Chewing Gum Composition - Abrasive in the Coat<br><br>
In the present example, the abrasive agent is present in the coat. An inventive gum<br>
composition is prepared by conventional methods to form Composition G in Table 4.<br>
Briefly, a gum base is softened with heating. The molten gum base and filler are added to the<br>
mixing kettle and mixing is commenced. The sugar alcohols, glycerin, chelating agent<br>
(sodium tripolyphosphate), surfactant (hydroxy fatty acid salt), flavors and high intensity<br>
sweetener mixture are added in portions to obtain a substantially homogeneous mixture. The<br>
mixture is then discharged from the mixing kettle, and formed into cores by conventional<br>
techniques.<br>
The cores are placed into a coating pan and broken into individual pieces as<br>
necessary. A sugarless solution containing 70% by weight of maltitol, as well as titanium<br>
dioxide, gum arabic and water is heated to between 70Â°C and 80Â°C. The solution is sprayed<br>
onto the gum core pieces in layers and allowed to dry between sprays while the coating pan is<br>
continually rotating to ensure a smooth even coat of the gum cores.<br><br>
The coating is built up to about 8% by weight of the final pellet weight. Ace-K is<br>
then added and then covered with another layer of the above-mentioned coating solution and<br>
then allowed to dry.<br>
After the high intensity sweetener layer is dried, the abrasive agent (silicon dioxide)<br>
and a flavorant are added in alternating layers until all of the respective materials are added<br>
with each layer being allowed to dry before the next layer is applied. The coating process is<br>
continued with the coating solution until the coat comprises 24% by weight of the final pellet<br>
weight.<br>
The coating is then topped with a conventional finishing solution until a shell weight<br>
of 25% by weight, is obtained. The pellets are then polished in a polishing pan with candelilla<br>
wax in a conventional manner.<br>
Example 4 - Pressed Mint Products<br>
A composition for forming a pressed mint product in accordance with the present<br>
