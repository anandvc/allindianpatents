The present invention also relates to a process for the preparation of the above said novel compounds, their derivatives, their analogs, their tautomeric forms, their stereoisomers, their polymorphs, their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, their pharmaceutically acceptable solvates, and pharmaceutical compositions containing them.<br>
15	The compounds of general formula (I) are useful in lowering elevated levels of cholesterol (TC),<br>
low-density lipoproteins (LDL), triglycerides, free fatty acids, glucose, insulin and the like; while increasing high-density lipoproteins, which results in beneficial effect in the mammals.<br>
The compounds of the general formula (I) lower or modulate triglyceride levels and/or cholesterol levels and/or low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and raise HDL plasma levels and hence are useful in<br>
20 combating different medical conditions, where such lowering (and raising) is beneficial. Thus, it could be used in the treatment and/or prophylaxis of obesity, hyperlipidaemia, hypercholesteremia, hypertension, atherosclerotic disease events, vascular restenosis, diabetes and many other related conditions.<br>
The compounds of general formula (I) are useful to prevent or reduce the risk of developing atherosclerosis, which leads to diseases and conditions such as artereosclerotic cardiovascular diseases,<br>
25 stroke, coronary heart diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, peripheral vessel diseases and related disorders. These compounds of general formula (I) are useful for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of metabolic disorders loosely defined as Syndrome X. The characteristic features of Syndrome X include initial insulin resistance followed by hyperinsulinemia, dyslipidemia and impaired glucose tolerance. The glucose intolerance can lead to non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM, Type 2 diabetes),<br>
30 which is characterized by hyperglycemia, which if not controlled may lead to diabetic complications or metabolic disorders caused by insulin resistance. Diabetes is no longer considered to be associated only<br><br>
with glucose metabolism, but it affects anatomical and physiological parameters, the intensity of which vary depending upon stages/duration and severity of the diabetic state. The compounds of this invention are also useful in prevention, halting or slowing progression or reducing the risk of the above mentioned disorders along with the resulting secondary diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, like 5 arteriosclerosis, atherosclerosis; diabetic retinopathy, diabetic neuropathy and renal disease including diabetic nephropathy, glomerulonephritis, glomerular sclerosis, nephrotic syndrome, hypertensive nephrosclerosis and end stage renal diseases, like microalbuminuria and albuminuria, which may be result of hyperglycemia or hyperinsulinemia.<br>

10      cognitive functions in dementia, and in the treatment and/or prophylaxis of disorders such as psoriasis,<br>
polycystic  ovarian  syndrome   (PCOS),   cancer,   osteoporosis,   leptin  resistance,   inflammation   and<br>
inflammatory bowel diseases, xanthoma, pancreatitis, myotonic dystrophy, endothelial cell dysfunction<br>
and hyperlipidemia.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are useful in the treatment of the diseases mentioned herein,<br>
15      alone    or    in    combination    one    or   more    hypoglycemic,    antihyperglycemic,    hypolipidaemic,<br>
hypolipoproteinemic agents, antioxidants, antihypertensives, such as HMG CoA reductase inhibitor,<br>
fibrate,   statins,    glitazones,    sulfonyl   ureas,    insulin,    cc-glycosidase    inhibitors,    nicotinic   acid,<br>
cholestyramine, cholestipol or probucol, and the like.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
20	Hyperlipidaemia has been recognized as the major risk factor in causing cardiovascular diseases due<br>
to atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis and other such peripheral vascular diseases affect the quality of life of a large population in the world. The emphasis during the therapy is laid on lowering the elevated plasma LDL cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein and plasma triglycerides in order to prevent or reduce the risk of occurrence of cardiovascular diseases.  The details of etiology in atherosclerosis and coronary artery<br>
25 diseases is discussed by Ross and Glomset [New Engl. J. Med., 295, 369-377 (1976)]. Plasma cholesterol is generally esterified with various serum lipoproteins and numerous studies suggest an inverse relation between serum HDL-cholesterol level and risk for occurrence of cardiovascular disease. Many studies have suggests an increased risk of coronary artery diseases (CAD) due to elevated LDL and VLDL-cholesterol levels [Stampfer et al, N. Engl. J. Med., 325, 373-381(1991)]. The other studies illustrate<br>
30 protective effects of HDL against progression of atherosclerosis. Thus, HDL has become a crucial factor in treating diseases with increased levels of cholesterol [Miller et. al., Br. Med. J. 282, 1741-1744(1981); Picardo et al, Arteriosclerosis, 6, 434-441 (1986); Macikinnon et al, J. Biol. Chem. 261, 2548-2552 (1986)].<br>
Diabetes is associated with a number of complications and also affects a large population. Usually,<br>
35      the disease is closely associated with other diseases such as obesity, hyperlipidemia, hypertension and<br>
2<br><br>
angina. It is a well recognized that improper treatment aggravates impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance, leading to frank diabetes. Further, patients with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes often have raised triglycerides and low HDL-cholesterol concentrations and therefore, have greater risk of cardiovascular diseases. The present therapy mostly includes sulfonylureas and biguanides along with 5 insulin. This drug therapy have limitations such as mild to severe hypoglycemia, which may lead to coma or in some cases may lead to death. The later mainly results due to unsatisfactory glycaemic control. The recent addition of thiazolidinediones, drugs having insulin-sensitizing action. Thiazolidinediones are prescribed alone or in combination with other anti-diabetic agents like troglitazone, rosiglitazone and pioglitazone. These are useful in treating diabetes, affects lipid metabolism but are suspected to have 10 tumor-inducing potential and cause hepatic dysfunction, which may lead to liver failure. Further, serious undesirable side-effects have occurred in animal and/or human studies including cardiac hypertrophy, hema dilution and liver toxicity in a few glitazones progressing to advanced human trials. The drawback is considered to be idiosyncratic. Presently, there is need for a safe and an effective drug, to treat insulin resistance, diabetes and hyperlipidemia.<br>
15	Obesity is another major health problem being associated with increased morbidity and mortality. It<br>
is a metabolic disorder, in which excess of fat is accumulated in the body. Although, its etiology is unclear, the general feature includes excess of calorie intake than it is consumed. Various therapies such as dieting, exercise, appetite suppression, inhibition of fat absorption etc. have been used to combat obesity. However, more efficient therapies to treat this abnormality is essential as obesity is closely<br>
20 related to several diseases such as coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes, gout, osteoarthritis, hyperlipidaemia and reduced fertility. It also leads to social and psychological problems.<br>
Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor (PPAR) is a member of the steroid/ retinoid/ thyroid hormone receptor family. PPARoc, PPARy and PPAR8 have been identified as subtypes of PPARs. Extensive reviews regarding PPAR, their role in different diseased conditions are widely published<br>
25 [Endocrine Reviews, 20(5), 649-688 (1999); J. Medicinal Chemistry, 43(4), 58-550 (2000); Cell, 55, 932-943 (1999); Nature, 405, 421-424 (2000); Trends in pharmacological ScL, 469-473 (2000)]. PPARy activation has been found to play a central role in initiating and regulating adipocyte differentiation [Endocrinology 135, 798-800, (1994)] and energy homeostasis, [Cell, 83, 803-812 (1995); Cell, 99, 239-242 (1999)]. PPARy agonists would stimulate the terminal differentiation of adipocyte precursors and<br>
30 cause morphological and molecular changes characteristic of a more differentiated, less malignant state. During adipocyte differentiation, several highly specialized proteins are induced, which are being involved in lipid storage and metabolism. It is accepted that PPARy activation leads to expression of CAP gene [Cell biology, 95, 14751-14756, (1998)], however, the exact link from PPARy activation to changes in glucose metabolism and decrease in insulin resistance in muscle has not been clear. PPARa is<br>
35      involved in stimulating [3-oxidation of fatty acids [Trends Endocrine. Metabolism, 4, 291-296 (1993)]<br>
3<br><br>
""resulting in plasma circulating free fatty acid reduction [Current Biol., 5, 618-621 (1995)]. Recently, role of PPARy activation in the terminal differentiation of adipocyte precursors has been implicated in the treatment of cancer. [Cell, 79, 1147-1156 (1994); Cell, vol. No., 377-389 (1996); Molecular Cell, 465-470 (1998); Carcinogenesis, 1949-1953 (1998); Proc. Natl. Acad Sci., 94, 237-241 (1997); Cancer 5 Research, 58, 3344-3352 (1998)]. Since PPARy is expressed in certain cells consistently, PPARy agonists would lead to nontoxic chemotherapy. There is growing evidence that PPAR agonists may also influence the cardiovascular system through PPAR receptors as well as directly by modulating vessel wall function [Med. Res. Rev., 20 (5), 350-366 (2000)].<br>
PPAR a agonists have been found useful in the treatment of obesity (WO 97/36579). Dual PPAR a 10      and y agonists have been suggested to be useful for Syndrome X (WO 97/25042). PPAR y agonists and HMG-CoA  reductase   inhibitors  have   exhibited   synergism   and  indicated  the  usefulness  of the combination in the treatment of atherosclerosis and xanthoma (EP 0753 298).<br>
Leptin is a protein when bound to leptin receptors is involved in sending satiety signal to the<br>
hypothalamus.     Leptin  resistance  would therefore  lead to  excess  food  in-take,  reduced  energy<br>
15      expenditure, obesity, impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes.    It has been reported that insulin<br>
sensitizers lower plasma leptin concentration [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 93, 5793-5796 (1996): WO<br>
98/02159)].<br>
A number of compounds have been reported to be useful in the treatment of hyperlipidemia,<br>
hypercholesterolemia and hyperglycemia   [US 5,306,726, US 5,985,884, US 6,054,453, EP 90 3343,<br>
20      PCT publications Nos. WO 91/19702, WO 94/01420, WO 94/13650, WO 95/03038, WO 95/17394, WO<br>
96/04260, WO 96/04261, WO 96/33998, WO 97/25042, WO 97/36579, WO 98/28534, WO 99/08501,<br>

A few P-aryl-oc-hydroxypropanoic acids, their derivatives, and their analogs have been reported to be useful in the treatment of hyperglycemia and hypercholesterolemia. Some of such compounds described 25      in the prior art are outlined below :<br>
