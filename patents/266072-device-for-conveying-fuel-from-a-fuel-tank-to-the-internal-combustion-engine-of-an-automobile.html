				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>Prior art devices have a sucking jet pump, which is placed inside a storage reservoir and which delivers fuel from a supply reservoir and into the storage reservoir via a suction opening located in the bottom of the storage reservoir. A filter cloth is situated upstream from the suction opening and filters out dirt particles contained in the fuel inside the supply reservoir so that these particles can not impair the operability of valves situated downstream from the suction opening. A drawback exists in that the filter cloth becomes increasingly stopped up when filtering highly impure fuel whereby resulting in an increasing loss in pressure so that, with the same delivery capacity of the delivery pump, increasingly less fuel is delivered into the storage reservoir. The inventive device provides an alternative particle precipitation that has a higher holding capacity for particles than that of the prior art. The invention provides that a number of chambers (24), which are open toward the storage reservoir (2) and which serve for the precipitation of dirt particles contained in the fuel, are placed on and/or inside the bottom (23) of the storage reservoir (2) on the inner side (19) facing the delivery pump (16). The delivery pump (16) is arranged in such a manner that the fuel coming out of the delivery pump (16) flows over the chambers (24).</td>

Device for conveying fuel from a fuel tank to the internal combustion engine of an automobile<br>
State of the Art of Technology<br>
The invention is based on a device according to the generic description of the main claim. Already a device for conveying of fuel is known from the parent document US 5,080,077, with a suction jet pump provided in a storage tank, which conveys fuel through an intake suction opening in a bottom of the storage tank from a reservoir into the storage tank. A filter fabric is located upstream of the intake suction opening which filters out the dirt particles contained in the fuel of the reservoir, so that this cannot negatively influence the functional ability of the valves located downstream of the suction inlet opening, The disadvantage is that the filter fabric under heavy impure fuel gets clogged increasingly and as a result generates an increasing pressure loss; so much so by identical efficiency of the suction jet pump progressively lesser fuel is conveyed into the storage tank.<br>
Advantages of the invention<br>
The invention based device with the distinguishing characteristics of the main claim, in contrast, has the advantage that in a simple manner an alternative separation of the dirt particles from the fuel of the reservoir is proposed, in that on and/or in the bottom of the storage tank at an inner side facing the conveyor pump several chambers open towards the storage tank are visualized for the<br><br>
purpose of separating the dirt particles contained in the fuel, where the conveyor pump is arranged such that the fuel exiting from the conveyor pump over-fills the chamber.<br>
Advantages, further designs and improvements of the device indicated in the main claim are possible through the measures enumerated in the sub-claims.<br>
What is especially advantageous is if the chambers in the flow direction of the fuel exiting from the conveyor pump are arranged one after the other, because, in this manner, the particles are more efficiently separated in the chambers.<br>
Further advantage is if additionally the chambers are arranged side by side seen from the flow direction of the fuel exiting from the conveyor pump, because in this way the separation effect is still more improved.<br>
The advantage is still greater if the chambers are created through the walls projecting from the bottom of the storage tank, because this design can be manufactured especially easily and cost-effectively through injection moulding.<br>
Further advantage is if the chambers are formed through at least two guide-walls, which are connected with one another through several separation walls running transverse to the flow direction, because this design makes it especially possible to manufacture in a simple and cost-effective manner through injection moulding.<br>
What is further more advantageous is if the storage container represents one of the guide walls, because in this way it is guaranteed that nearly the entire fuel exiting from the reservoir flows across the chambers and would be cleaned off their dirt particles.<br><br>
It is advantageous if the height of the guide walls and /or the separation walls measured in axial direction of the storage tank increases in the flow direction of the fuel exiting from the conveyor pump because in this manner the separation effect is improved.<br>
In accordance with an advantageous design the conveyor aggregate is a suction jet pump<br>
It is further more advantageous if the conveyor aggregate is arranged in such a manner that the fuel jet exiting from an outlet of the conveyor aggregate in the fuel tank meets at a slant on the circumference wall of the fuel container because in this way the fuel jet flow is not fragmented but nestles on the circumference wall and flows along it. As a result, almost the entire fuel quantity flows past the chambers with the result that an adequate cleaning of the fuel is guaranteed.<br>
Drawing<br>
A design example of the invention is illustrated in a simplified version in the drawing and further explained in the following description:<br>
Figure 1 shows a schematic view of the invention based device and<br>
Figure 2 a storage container with a conveyor pump.<br>
Description of the design example<br>
Figure 1 shows schematically a device for conveying of fuel.<br><br>
The device for instance, serves to convey of fuel from a reservoir 1 in a storage tank 2 and from there to an internal combustion engine 4 of an automobile through a conveyor aggregate 3.<br>
In the reservoir 1 the storage container 2 is located and the conveyor aggregate 3 in the storage container 2. The conveyor aggregate 3 is for instance, a flow pump of a squeeze-out pump.<br>
The pot-shaped storage container 2 for instance, stocks adequately large fuel, so thart a fuel supply of the IC engine 4 is ensured through the conveyor aggregate 3, even if, for instance, through a rolling turn and the resultant splash movements of the fuel in the reservoir 1 no fuel is conveyed to the storage container 2.<br>
The conveyor aggregate 3 sucks for instance through a pre-filter type and a suction line 6 fuel from the storage container 2 and conveys the fuel through an outlet 7 in a pressure line 8, leading to the IC engine 4. The pre-filter 5 protects the device in the downward flow of the pre-filter 5 against large dirt particles in the fuel.<br>
In the pressure line 8 a check /non-return valve 9 is visualized and a main filter 10 in the downward flow of the check valve. The check valve 9 prevents the fuel flowing back in the storage container 2, under a switched-off conveying equipment 3 from the pressure line 8 downstream flow of the check valve 9, after upstream flow of the check valve 9 through the conveyor aggregate 3 the suction line 6 and the pre-filter 5. The main filter 10 filters the fine dirt particles contained in the fuel and thus protects for instance the fuel injection valve of the IC engine from blockage.<br>
When the excess pressure line 13 branches from the pressure line 8, downstream of the man filter 10, in which a pressure regulating valve 14 is visualized.   If the pressure in the pressure line 8 exceeds the pre-determined<br><br>
valve/the pressure regulating valve 14 opens and allows the fuel from the pressure line 8 to flow back into the fuel storage container 2 to remove the excess power line 13. In this way, pressure in the pressure line 8 decreases again below the pre-determined pressure and the pressure regulating valve 14 shuts again.<br>
Downstream of the conveyor aggregate 3 and upstream of the non-return valve 9, a dry pipeline 15 branches from the pressure line 8, which for instance serves to supply and push forward fuel to a conveyor pump, for instance, a so-called suction jet pump 16, from the pressure line 8. The suction jet pump 16 can also be explicitly supplied by fuel from the excess pressure line 13 or from a reverse flow line (not illustrated) re-directed from the IC engine 4 in the reservoir 1. In order that the fuel storage container 2 is not sucked empty by the conveyor aggregate 3, the suction jet pump 16 conveys fuel from the reservoir 1 through a suction opening 7 in the fuel storage container 2. The sucked fuel is conveyed, together with the so-called drive jet of the drive line 15 in the fuel storage container 2. In the drive line 15 for instance, a throttle element 21 is visualized in order to specify and to restrict the volume jet flowing from the drive line 15. In order to ensure that th4e throttle element 21 cannot get blocked, an additional pre-filter 22 is visualized in the drive line 15 upward flow of the throttle element 21.<br>
A suction jet pump is for instance known from document DE 198 56 298 C1 where its contents are explicitly supposed to form part of disclosure of this application.<br>
The fuel storage container 2 is for instance designed pot-shaped with an axis 20 (figure 2) and has a surface - bottom 23. The suction jet pump 16 is for instance provided on the surface bottom 23.<br><br>
Under the state of art of technology the fuel sucked through the suction openin 17 is cleaned off of dirt particles through the filter. This filter get clogged increasingly with the result that the pressure loss of the filter also increases and under identical efficiency of the suction jet pump progressively lesser fuel is sucked in the fuel storage tank 2. Under the following invention, this filter can be dispensed with, in that an alternative separation of the dirt particles is visualized. In this way, the pressure loss in the area of the suction opening 17 remains constant, so that under identical performance efficiency of the suction jet pump 16, same quantity of fuel is always conveyed into the fuel storage container 2.<br>
According to the invention, on and /or in the surface bottom 23 or the fuel storage container 2 on the inner side 19 facing the suction jet pump 16, several chambers 24 are visualized for separating the dirt particles contained in the fuel of the reservoir 1. The chambers 24 are designed on their upper side opposite to the surface bottom 23, open towards the fuel storage tank 2. The shape of the chambers 24 is optional. The suction jet pump 16, according to the invention is located in such a manner that the fuel exiting from the suction jet pump 16 in the fuel storage container 2 overflows the chambers 24.<br>
The chambers 24 are arranged in a flow direction 26 of the fuel exiting from the suction jet pump 16 in the fuel storage container 2 one after the other. It can also be planned that additional chambers 24 can also be arranged side by side, when seen in this flow direction 26. The chambers 24 are for instance arranged one after the other in a partial circular shape; however, they can even be placed in a straight line or in any other optional form in series. The chambers 24 are for instance created through walls 25 projecting from the bottom surface 23 of the fuel storage container 2. In a different design the chambers 24can even be created through indentations /deepening in the bottom 23.<br><br>
The fuel directed from the suction jet pump 16 in the fuel storage container 2 through the chambers 24 is slowed down through the chambers 24. The chambers 24 represent for the flow a dead water area in which turbulence / whirl develop. In the process, the dirt particles contained in the fuel directed through the chambers 24 are separated, for instance through the slowing down of the flow and the development of turbulence in the chambers 24 as a result of their inertia, and settle down on the surface of the individual chambers 24. The volumes of the chamber 24 is designed such that there is an adequately large capacity for accepting dirt particles, and the chambers do not get completely filled-up within the medium life-time of a vehicle. The capacity of the chambers is significantly larger as against the filtering solutions of the state of art of technology.<br>
Figure 2 shows a section of the device according to figure 1 in which however only the fuel storage tank, the suction jet pump and the chambers are illustrated.<br>
Under the device as per figure 2, components which are similar or functionally similar to those of the device according to figure 1, are identified with the same reference numbers.<br>
In the design example illustrated in figure 2, the chambers 24 are created through for instance two dyed walls 28 at a distance from one another, between which several separation walls 30 running transverse to the flow direction 26 and at a distance to each other are arranged, which for instance, join the guide walls 28 with one another. The guide walls 28 are for instance arch-shaped and run at least approximately in the same direction. The guide walls can however have an explicitly optional shape. The separation walls 30 extend in axial direction with reference to the axis 20 of the fuel storage container / pot 2 for instance up to the surface bottom 23 of the container 2, so that chambers separated from one another are created.<br><br>
The chambers 24 for instance, are radially so arranged towards the outer witn reference to the axis 20 that they border at a circumference wall 29 of the container 2. In this manner the chambers 24 are restricted radially towards the outer by the container 2, which represents together with the circumference wall 29 one of the guide walls 28. The other guide wall 28 is arranged radially towards the inner of the circumference wall 29 and is at a distance to it.<br>
The height of the guide walls 28 measured in axial direction with reference to the axis 20 of the fuel storage tank 2 is for instance larger than the height of the separation walls 30 measured in the same direction; this can however also be the same. The part of the guide walls 28 upper half of the separation walls 30 serves to guide the flow of the fuel exiting from the suction jet pump 16, passing over the chambers 24.<br>
In the design as per figure 2, the height of the separation walls 30 arranged one after the other, in the flow direction 26 increases from one separation wall 30 to the next. Moreover, the height of the radial inner guide wall 28 in the flow direction 26 for instance increases continuously. The height of the separation walls 30 and at least one guide wall 28 can however be also constant in the flow direction 26, or even decrease.<br>
The suction jet pump 16 has an inlet 33 for the fuel of the drive line 15 and an outlet 34, also known as mixing channel, in the fuel storage tank 2. Through the intersection opening 17 at the bottom floor 23 fuel is sucked from the reservoir into the suction jet pump 16 which lands in the fuel storage tank 2 together with the fuel of the drive line 15 through outlet 34, and subsequently flows through between the guide walls 28 through the chambers 24.<br>
The suction jet pump 16 is for instance so located that the fuel jet exiting from the outlet 34 it is directed towards the chamber 24, where the outlet 34 of the suction jet pump 16 is proposed as near as possible to the chambers 24.  This way it is<br><br>
guaranteed that the entire quantity of fuel sucked from the reservoir 1 flows through the chambers 24 and cleaned off the dirt particles. Moreover the suction jet pump 16 for instance is so arranged that the fuel jet exiting from the outlet 34 is directed with a slant to the circumference wall 29 so that it nestles on the circumference wall 29 of the fuel storage container 2, flows along the wall 29 between the guide walls 28 and overflows the separation walls 30 with the chambers 24.<br><br><br><br>
