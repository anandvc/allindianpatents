Dry Powder Inhalation for Pulmonary Delivery and<br>
Manufacturing Method Thereof<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a dry powder inhalation for pulmonary delivery<br>
with improved pulmonary delivery performance and a manufacturing method thereof In<br>
particular, the present invention pertains to a dry powder inhalation for pulmonary<br>
delivery showing excellent pulmonary delivery performance which is obtained by coating<br>
a fine biologically active substance in crystal form with a specific electrostatic<br>
aggregation-inhibiting substance, and a manufacturing method thereof<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Inhalation administration has been widely used in the past as a therapeutic<br>
administration route for local disease in the lung, such as asthma, because it is possible to<br>
deliver directly to the lungs biologically active substance particles that have been made<br>
very fine. The powder particles that are handled in the field of inhalations are for the<br>
purpose of pulmonary (bronchial, bronchiolar, alveolar) delivery and therefore, are<br>
extremely fine (10 µm or smaller) when compared to powders and pharmaceutical<br>
preparations that are generally handled in the field of oral agents (several ten µm to<br>
several hundred µm). Nevertheless, such fine powder particles induce adhesion and<br>
aggregation between particles and dispersibility in the gas phase deteriorates. Therefore,<br>
there is concern that there will not be sufficient pulmonary delivery. Moreover, even if<br>
good pulmonary delivery performance is obtained, it is desirable in terms of quality<br>
assurance that adhesion and aggregation do not occur over time during storage.<br>
In recent years there has been an abundance of studies of pulmonary delivery<br>
formulations with inhalations of peptides and proteins the purpose of which is systemic<br>
absorption, that is, absorption into the blood. Nevertheless, although absorptivity is<br>
excellent with inhalation administration, these powder particles are extremely fine and<br>
thus, the biologically active substance dissolves quickly and the excellent absorption by<br>
the pulmonary mucosa that follows results in the time for which the drug effects of the<br>
biologically active substance act being short. There are therefore cases in which frequent<br>
administration is inevitable. Furthermore, there are concerns over the occurrence of<br>
systemic adverse effects in the case of biologically active substances that display<br>
extremely strong effects because of this excellent absorptivity.<br>
Consequently, there is a demand in the development of powder inhalations for<br>
pharmaceutical preparations that not only improve pulmonary delivery performance of<br>
dry powder inhalations for pulmonary delivery containing a biologically active substance,<br>
but also are very safe, have excellent stability over time, and, depending on the case, can<br>
be given sustained-release performance in order to prolong the time for which they are<br>
effective in accordance with the biologically active substance that is used.<br>
There have been various attempts in the past aimed at improving pulmonary<br>
delivery performance. Mokhtar et al. prepared sustained-release microspheres for<br>
inhalation using polylactic acid, which is a base with in vivo degradability, and report on<br>
their pulmonary delivery performance, and the like ([non-patent reference 1 ] Int. J.<br>
Pharm. 175, 135-145 (1998)). Moreover, an invention is reported relating to a particle<br>
system for pulmonary delivery containing biodegradable particles with tap density, which<br>
is an indicator of bulk density when packed by tapping, of less than 0.4 g/cm3, wherein<br>
mass-average diameter is between 5µm and 30 µm (patent reference 1] International<br>
Publication Pamphlet No. W098/31346 (corresponds to Japanese Patent Application,<br>
National Publication 2001-526634)). In particular, it is disclosed that particle<br>
aggregation is avoided and pulmonary delivery performance is improved as a result of<br>
making sufficiently light paiticles by designing particles having a specific tap density and<br>
a specific average diameter in order to produce particles having a specific aerodynamic<br>
diameter. In addition, it also contends that release of biologically active substance inside<br>
the lungs can be controlled and that sustained release performance is enhanced by adding<br>
cholesterol.<br>
Nevertheless, although these microspheres for inhalation show good pulmonary<br>
delivery performance, a process whereby the biologically active substance is dissolved is<br>
used and therefore, there is concern that the biologically active substance will not retain<br>
its stability, leading to aggregation and the like, of microparticles over time and a<br>
reduction in pulmonary delivery performance. Furthermore, according to the latter<br>
Specification, particularly the results of in vitro dissolution tests shown in Figure 6, the<br>
composition of this technology shows the release all at once of 40% or more of the<br>
biologically active substance in the early stages after starting the test and therefore, there<br>
is also room for improvement in terms of providing sustained release performance<br>
because sufficiently controlled dissolution is not realized.<br>
A microparticle composition for pulmonary delivery which contains biologically<br>
active substance and biodegradable substance, is made from biocompatible particles, and<br>
has the properties of a tap density of less than 0.4g/cm3, a geometric particle diameter of<br>
5 to 30 µm, and an aerodynamic particle diameter of 1 to 5 µm is disclosed as another<br>
technology ([patent reference 2] International Publication Pamphlet WO 97/44103<br>
(corresponds to Japanese Patent National Publication 2000-511189)). As with the above-<br>
mentioned invention, there is a need for improved stability with this invention as well<br>
because a process whereby the biologically active substance is dissolved is used.<br>
Moreover, an invention relating to the use of a surfactant in the production of a<br>
drug for pulmonary delivery is disclosed. This drug comprises multiple porous fine<br>
structures that have been made into an aerosol using an inhalation device for presentation<br>
of an aerosol drug comprising a biologically active agent, and this aerosol drug is an<br>
administration form that is [administered] to the nose or part of the airway of the lungs of<br>
a patient requiring at least this aerosol drug ([patent reference 3] International Publication<br>
Pamphlet WO 99/16419 (corresponds to Japanese Patent National Publication 2001-<br>
517691). It is disclosed that by means of this invention it is possible to present a powder<br>
that has stable dispersibility, reduces attraction between particles, and shows relatively<br>
low cohesive force suitable for use of powder inhalations with a hollow or porous fine<br>
structure with the standard particle diameter and low bulk density. Nevertheless, special<br>
manufacturing methods and manufacturing conditions, including the addition of volatile<br>
substances, are necessary in order to realize such a porous fine structure as this aerosol<br>
drug. In addition, there is the concern that this drug will be amoiphous because of the<br>
manufacturing method whereby the drug is dissolved and there are concerns over not<br>
only [problems] with stability of the drug itself during storage under harsh conditions, but<br>
also aggregation between particles.<br>
As previously mentioned, various attempts have been made to improve<br>
pulmonary delivery performance of powder particles in the field of powder inhalations,<br>
but there is still room for improvement of dry powder inhalations for pulmonary delivery<br>
that can be prepared by a simple method and are very safe, have excellent stability over<br>
time, show excellent pulmonary delivery performance, and depending on the case, can be<br>
given sustained-release performance in accordance with the biologically active substance<br>
that is used.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
In light of these conditions, the inventors performed intense research in order to<br>
overcome the above-mentioned problems and as a result, they discovered that when a<br>
specific electrostatic aggregation-inhibiting substance having a phase transition<br>
temperature and/or melting point of 40°C or higher, such as cholesterol or hydrogenated<br>
lecithin, is selected and a fine biologically active substance powder in crystal form is<br>
coated with the above-mentioned specific substance, cohesiveness of the particles<br>
themselves is improved over powder particles containing a crystalline biologically active<br>
substances that has not been coated, or that have been coated with the above-mentioned<br>
specific substance but contain a biologically active substance that is not in crystal form,<br>
and therefore, good pulmonary delivery performance is obtained and excellent pulmonary<br>
delivery performance is realized even after storage over time under high-temperature<br>
conditions. Furthermore, the present invention was successfully completed upon<br>
discovering that when, of these specific substances, a hydrophobic substance is used, the<br>
coated particles show sustained dissolution whereby by means of the dissolution test<br>
method discussed later, dissolution during the early stages of the test is sufficiently<br>
controlled.<br>
Although the mechanism by which pulmonary delivery performance is markedly<br>
improved by the present invention is not yet clear, it is estimated that by coating the<br>
biologically active substance in crystal form with the above-mentioned specific substance,<br>
biologically active substance is not exposed where the powder particles contact one<br>
another and adhesion between powder particles is reduced. Moreover, with regard to<br>
sustained release performance, it is estimated that because there is less biologically active<br>
substance that contacts the dissolution test fluid when compared to technology with<br>
which amorphous biologically active substance is exposed (matrix technology that<br>
includes an amorphous biologically active substance), a more hydrophobic environment<br>
is made and penetration by dissolution test fluid is delayed, and the like, resulting in the<br>
realization of sustained release. It is estimated that dissolution of biologically active<br>
substance is controlled during the early stages when dissolution tests are started because<br>
biologically active substance in amorphous form is not exposed.<br>
Dissolution usually is fast due to an increase in surface area when the particles ai-e<br>
fine and it was a completely unexpected finding that sustained release can be realized,<br>
and stability and pulmonary delivery performance can also be realized even if a<br>
biologically active substance in crystal form is used.<br>
Incidentally, a powder inhalation obtained by making a drug into fine [particles]<br>
in a state of being suspended in an aqueous polymer solution together with lubricant and<br>
then spray drying is disclosed ([patent reference 3] Japanese Kokai Patent No. 11-79985).<br>
By means of the technology in question, lubricant is adhered to the drug with polymer so<br>
that lubricant is scattered over the surface of the drug and as a result, there is a reduction<br>
in the amount that deposits on the powder dispersing device and dispersibility in the gas<br>
phase is improved. The amount of this lubricant is 1 to 3 wt% and therefore, this is<br>
different from the technical means of the present invention, the purpose of which is to<br>
coat the biologically active substance. Moreover, it is essential to use a polymer<br>
substance as the adhesion base in the technology in question. The<br>
hydroxypropylcellulose, and the like, that is used does not decompose in vivo and<br>
therefore, there is also concern over accumulation in the lungs.<br>
That is, the present invention pertains to<br>

temperature of 40°C or higher, it is obtained by coating the biologically active substance<br>
with this [biocompatible] substance, and it has a geometric particle diiuiieter of 0.5 to 8<br>
µm.<br>
The "fine" biologically active substance used in the present invention means a<br>
biologically active substance particle that has been made into fine [particles] with a<br>
geometric particle diameter of 0.5 µm to 8 µm, preferably 0.5 µm to 5 µm, further<br>
preferably 0.5 µm to 3 µm.<br>
The "geometric particle diameter" here represents the average particle diameter of<br>
the primary particles of the powder. It can be found by, for instance, determining Feret's<br>
diameter, which is a constant-direction diameter that is obtained by three-dimensional<br>
random arrangement of particles and measurement of particle dimension in a constant<br>
direction. Feret's diameter can be obtained by determining the maximum dimension of a<br>
particle in a constant direction. In the present invention it means the value that is<br>
obtained from the average when Feret's diameter of 100 particles is determined with an<br>
image magnified 2000 X under an electron microscope (JSM-5400, JEOL, Ltd.).<br>
"Crystal form" means that the biologically active substance of the present<br>
invention is present as crystals and it can also include the morphology where a part of this<br>
substance is present in amorphous form. "A part" means approximately a weight ratio of<br>
0% to approximately 30%, preferably approximately 0% to approximately 15%, further<br>
preferably approximately 0% to approximately 10%, per total weight.<br>
Moreover, "melting point" in the present invention means in particular the<br>
temperature when the substance in the solid phase maintains equilibrium with the liquid<br>
phase, and "phase transition temperature" means the temperature at which a substance<br>
changes to a different phase, for instance, the temperature at which there is transition<br>
from the solid phase to the liquid phase, or the glass transition temperature. They are<br>
entered as "melting point and/or phase transition temperature" because there are<br>
substances that have both a melting point or a phase transition temperature. For instance,<br>
phosphatidylcholine (melting point of approximately 235°C, phase transition temperature<br>
of-15 to 1-7°C) is excluded. The substance in question is excluded when its melting<br>
point and/or phase transition temperature is 40°C or lower.<br>
The "biocompatibility" in the present invention means a substance that is present<br>
in vivo or a pharmaceutically acceptable substance that dissolves and decomposes in vivo.<br>
Examples are those entered in the Japanese Pharmacopoeia (14th edition, Hirokawa<br>
Shoten), Dictionary of Pharmaceutical Additives (Nominating Committee, Evaluation<br>
and Registration Division, Pharmaceutical Affairs Bureau, Ministry of Health and<br>
Welfare, Japan Pharmaceutical Additives Association, editors), USP, EP, and Inactive<br>
Ingredient Guide (by Drug Information Resources), and those used as fillers for<br>
inhalations and injections are particularly ideal examples.<br>
The "electrostatic aggregation-inhibiting substance" in the present invention<br>
means, for instance, a substance that, when coated on a fine biologically active substance<br>
in crystal form, produces a powder with an electrostatic charge of between 0 and 3x10-9<br>
Q as determined by the Faraday gauge method described in the test examples given later.<br>
The "coated" in the present invention means that the fine biologically active<br>
substance is coated with electrostatic aggregation-inhibiting substance. That is, in the<br>
present invention both the embodiment where all of the biologically active substance is<br>
coated with the above-mentioned [electrostatic aggregation-inhibiting] substance and the<br>
embodiment where a part of [the biologically active substance] is coated [with the above-<br>
mentioned electrostatic aggregation-inhibiting substance] are defined as "coated." The<br>
case where biologically active, substance in crystal form is dispersed and supported in the<br>
above-mentioned [electrostatic aggregation-inhibiting] substance (so-called matrix) can<br>
also be included in the "coated" of the present invention. However, it does not include<br>
the embodiment of a matrix that contains amorphous biologically active substance. The<br>
above-mentioned embodiments that are obtained differ with the particle diameter of the<br>
biologically active substance in crystal form that is used and therefore, each of the above-<br>
mentioned embodiments that comprise biologically active substance in crystal form can<br>
also be contained in the composition that is obtained.<br>
The "pulmonary delivery performance (respirable fraction)" in the present<br>
invention means the ratio of particles capable of aerodynamic pulmonary delivery.<br>
"Aerodynamic" means the properties of particles in air. Specifically, "pulmonary<br>
delivery performance (respirable fraction)" means the ratio of particles trapped on each<br>
plate with a cut off diameter within a range of 0.43 to 5.80 µm when determined in<br>
accordance with the cascade impactor method (U.S. Pharmacopoeia, 24th edition).<br>
Moreover, it means the ratio of powder that has reached Stage 2 when determined in<br>
accordance with the twin impinger method (US Pharmacopoeia, 23rd edition). In<br>
particular, "excellent pulmonary delivery performance" in the present invention means a<br>
percentage improvement as defined below of 30% or greater.<br>
Percentage improvement (%) =<br>
Respirable fraction of composition of present invention -<br>
Respirable fraction of comparative control /<br>
Respirable fraction of comparative, control x 100<br>
The "excellent stability" in the present invention means that aggregation of<br>
particles is not seen, even with storage of the dry powder inhalation for pulmonary<br>
delivery of the present invention under specific conditions, for instance, 40°C, and the<br>
like, or there is no reduction in the respirable fraction.<br>
The present invention will now be described in further detail.<br>
Geometric particle diameter of the biologically active substances submitted for<br>
production of the composition of the present invention is approximately 0.5 to<br>
approximately 8 |im, preferably approximately 0.5 µm to approximately 5 µm, further<br>
preferably approximately 0.5 µm to approximately 3 µm.<br>
Moreover, geometric particle diameter of the dry powder inhalation for<br>
pulmonary delivery of the present invention is preferably approximately 0.5 to<br>
approximately 8 µm further preferably approximately 0.5 µm to approximately 5 µm. In<br>
addition, the optimum geometric particle diameter is 0.5 to 3 µm. There is no difference<br>
between the geometric particle diameter of the biologically active substance and the<br>
geometric particle diameter of the dry powder inhalation for pulmonary delivery because<br>
the embodiment is either one where all of the biologically active substance is coated by<br>
very thin film of electrostatic aggregation-inhibiting substance, one where only a part of<br>
the biologically active substance is covered, or an embodiment that contains both of the<br>
above-mentioned embodiments.<br>
The composition of the present invention is an embodiment wherein fine<br>
biologically active substance in crystal form is coated with a biocompatible, electrostatic<br>
aggregation-inhibiting substance. A structure wherein fine biologically active substance<br>
in crystal fonn is coated with one or more biocompatible, electrostatic aggregation-<br>
inhibiting substances, a structure wherein fine biologically active substance in crystal<br>
form is coated in multilayers with multiple biocompatible, electrostatic aggregation-<br>
inhibiting substances, and a structure wherein multiple fine biologically active substances<br>
in crystal form are coated with a biocompatible, electrostatic aggregation-inhibiting<br>
substance are given as examples. Furthermore, it is also possible to submit combinations<br>
of several of the above-mentioned compositions with different structures at the<br>
appropriate ratio in order to accomplish the desired pulmonary delivery performnance.<br>
Moreover, it is also possible to submit a mixture of large particles (hereafter<br>
referred to as carrier) represented by lactose with a geometric particle diameter of 20 µm<br>
or larger, which are generally used in the field of inhalations, and biologically active<br>
substance in crystal form that has been coated with one or more biocompatible,<br>
electrostatic aggregation-inhibiting substance. The lactose microparticles Pharmatose<br>
325M (geometric average particle diameter of approximately 60 µm) made by DMV is<br>
given as a specific example of a carrier that is generally used in the field of inhalations.<br>
The biocompatible, electrostatic-aggregation inhibiting substance that is used in<br>
the present invention is a substance that is present in vivo or a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable substance that dissolves and decomposes in vivo, and is a biocompatible<br>
powder that inhibits electrostatic aggregation. Lipids, fatty acids and their esters,<br>
surfactants, polyethylene glycol, amino acids, and the like are given. Phospholipids,<br>
terpenoids, fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene glycol, polyethylene<br>
glycol, and amino acids can be given as specific examples. These are substances with a<br>
melting point and/or phase-transition temperature of 40°C or higher. If this temperature<br>
is lower than 40°[C], the substance will be difficult to handle during manufacture and it<br>

The amount of biologically active substance in crystal form that is added is<br>
usually the therapeutic effective amount or prophylactic effective amount selected as<br>

There are no set standards, but, for instance, 0.05 to 99.95 wt%, preferably 0.05 to 99.5<br>
wt%, further preferably 0.05 to 99 wt%, particularly 0.05 to 95 wt%, of the total<br>
composition can be selected.<br>
There are no particular limits to the method of inhalation administration of the<br>
composition of the present invention. As with ordinary inhalations, the composition of<br>
the present invention can be filled in an appropriate capsule or blister and inhaled with an<br>
appropriate inhalation device. The composition of the present invention can also be<br>
dispersed in an appropriate solvent and inhaled through a nebulizer. Moreover, it can be<br>
dispersed in a propellant gas, such as chlorine-free hydrofluorocarbon, etc., capable of<br>
liquefaction under pressurization and inhaled as a popular MDI (meter dose inhaler).<br>
A powder capable of pulmonary delivery after dispersion using an inhalation<br>
device, etc., should be selected as the pharmaceutical preparation form of the<br>
composition of the present invention. That is, it should take on the state of a<br>
pharmaceutical preparation at the time of administration that becomes microparticles that<br>
can be present as a powder or primary particles by any means. For instance, the powder<br>
of the present invention can take on the state of a granulated product popular in the field<br>
of solid agents in order to further improve fluidity of a powder that is to be filled in a<br>
capsule. Moreover, it can also take on the state wherein an appropriate amount of the<br>
composition of the present invention is mixed with a carrier.<br>
Conventional methods of solid formulation can be used for formulation of the<br>
composition of the present invention, and it can be used in combination with one and/or<br>
two or more additives used in the past as needed, as long as it is within a range that has<br>
no effect on intrapulmonary delivery properties of this [composition]. Binders, extenders.<br>
fillers, lubricants, flavorings, fragrances, etc., can be given as this type of additive.<br>
Specifically, lactose, mannitol, fructose, glucose, fumaric acid, starch, and gelatin are<br>
given as examples of binders, and lactose, maltose, mannitol, xylitol, glycine, aspartic<br>
acid, starch, gelatin, dextran, and citric acid are given as examples of fillers. Lactose,<br>
starch, gelatin, fumaric acid, and phosphoric acid can be given as specific examples of<br>
lubricants, and lactose, maltose, mannitol, fructose, xylitol, and citric acid can be given as<br>
specific examples of flavorings.<br>
"Within a range that has no effect on pulmonary delivery performance" means<br>
that pulmonary delivery performance of the initial composition is not compromised.<br>
Furthermore, the binder that can be used in the present invention is not used for<br>
the purpose of adhering the electrostatic adhesion-inhibiting agent of the present<br>
invention to the biologically active substance.<br>
The composition of the present invention can be prepared by a simple<br>
manufacturing method. For instance, a composition can be made by suspending a<br>
biologically active substance in crystal form, which has been brought to a geometric<br>
particle diameter of 5 |im or smaller, in an appropriate solvent in which has been<br>
dissolved a biocompatible, electrostatic aggregation-inhibiting substance, such as<br>
cholesterol, and the like, and spray drying this suspension with a spray dryer and the like<br>
in order to remove the solvent. A conventional method can be used as the method of<br>
manufacturing particles with a geometric particle diameter of 5 µm or smaller. The<br>
method of manufacturing microparticles by micropulverization with a jet mill or<br>
microfluidizer and the like, a spray dryer, or means that employ a supercritical fluid such<br>
as carbon dioxide (supercritical fluid method) can be used.<br>
An organic solvent such as ethanol or methanol, water, a supercritical fluid such<br>
as CO2, and the like can be given as appropriate solvents that dissolve the biocompatible,<br>
electrostatic aggregation-inhibiting substance. Of these solvents, one that will not<br>
dissolve the biocompatible substance but will dissolve the electrostatic aggregation-<br>
inhibiting substance is selected in accordance with the biologically active substance.<br>
Moreover, even if the solvent is one that will dissolve both the biologically active<br>
substance and electrostatic aggregation-inhibiting substance, it is also possible to dissolve<br>
the electrostatic aggregation-inhibiting substance only by mixing different solvents,<br>
mixing a supercritical fluid and solvent, or adjusting the conditions, and the like. It<br>
should not be interpreted that the manufacturing method of the present invention is<br>
limited to these manufacturing methods.<br>
Next, the method of manufacturing the dry powder inhalation for pulmonary<br>
delivery of the present invention will be described.<br>
The biologically active substance in crystal form is pulverized under a<br>
pulverization air pressure of 5.0 b and a feed air pressure of 5.5 b with a jet mill<br>
pulverization device (Spiral Jet Mill 50AS of Hosokawa Micron Corp.) to prepare<br>
microparticles with a geometric particle diameter of 5 µm or smaller. Next, after<br>
dissolving, for instance, cholesterol (The Liposome Co., Inc.) in a mixture of ethanol and<br>
purified water, this jet mill-pulverized microparticles are added and ultrasound treated for<br>
five minutes to prepare a suspension. This suspension is spray dried under suitable<br>
conditions with, for instance, a spray dryer (for instance, DL-41 of Yamato Scientific Co.,<br>
Ltd.) to obtain the dry powder inhalation for pulmonary delivery of the present invention.<br>
Whether or not the biologically active substance is in crystal form can be<br>
confinned using a method such as X-ray analysis or differential scanning calorimetry<br>
(DSC).<br>
The present invention provides marked results in that it is possible to present by a<br>
simple method a dry powder inhalation for pulmonary delivery that is made from a<br>
biologically active substance in crystal form and a biocompatible, electrostatic<br>
aggregation-inhibiting substance and that has excellent safety, stability, and pulmonary<br>
delivery performance.<br>
Moreover, it is also possible to provide sustained release performance that is<br>
appropriate for the properties of the biologically active substance by selecting [the<br>
appropriate] hydrophobic substance.<br>

Comparative Example 7.<br>
First, 2.4 g of compound A (free form) jet mill-pulverized product (geometric<br>
particle diameter of 2.2 µm) were added to a mixture of 0.6 g of dipalmitoyl<br>
phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) (Nippon Fine Chemical Co., Ltd.), 400 g of ethanol, and<br>
197 g of purified water and heated and ultrasound treated for five minute to obtain a<br>
suspension with a solid concentration of 0.5 w/w%. This solution was spray dried with a<br>
spray dryer (DL-41 of Yamato Scientific Co., Ltd.) at a spraying liquid feed rate of 4<br>
g/min, atomizing air of 3 kgf/cm2, drying air of 0.8 m3/min, and inlet temperature of 65°C<br>
to obtain a powder for inhalation.<br>
Comparative Example 8<br>

Test 1. Observation of dry powder inhalations for pulmonary delivery and powders for<br>
inhalation under scanning electron microscope<br>
The dry powder inhalations for pulmonary delivery of Examples 1 through 5 and<br>
7, 8, 9 and 12 and powders for inhalation that were prepared in Comparative Examples 1<br>
through 3 and 5 and 6 were observed under a scanning election microscope (JSM-5400 of<br>
JEOL, Ltd.). Geometric particle diameter of all of the compositions and powders was 0.5<br>
to 5 µm, and was a particle diameter appropriate for powders for inhalation.<br>
Table 1. Geometric particle diameter of dry powder inhalations for pulmonary delivery<br>
and powders for inhalation<br>
Table 1<br>
Test 2. Electrostatic charge and performance of pulmonary delivery of dry powder<br>
inhalations for pulmonary delivery and powders for inhalation<br>
The electrostatic charge of dry powder inhalations for pulmonary delivery<br>
prepared in Examples 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9 and 12 and the powders for inhalation prepared in<br>
Comparative Examples 1, 2 and 6 was determined by the Faraday gauge method. The<br>
electrostatic charge of 1 g after vigorously shaking and the compositions and powders in<br>
an IWAKI polypropylene centrifugation tube (Asahi Technoglass) was determined with<br>
an electrostatic charge meter (KQ-431B of Kasuga Electric Works Ltd.)<br>
Furthermore, the respirable fraction was determined in accordance with the<br>
cascade impactor method (U.S. Pharmacopoeia, 24th edition). An appropriate amount of<br>
powder for inhalation was filled in an HPMC No. 2 capsule and charged in an inhalation<br>
device (JethalerTM of Unisia Jecs Co., Ltd.). Weight of the particles trapped on plates<br>
with cut-off diameters of 0.43 to 5.80 µm when the device was attached to the cascade<br>
impactor and air was drawn (28.3 ml/min, 10 sec) was determined. Total particle weight<br>
on each plate with the above-mentioned cut-off diameters to the amount filled in the<br>
capsule is served as the respirable fraction.<br>
Table 2. Results of electrostatic charge and respirable fraction of dry powder inhalations<br>
for pulmonary delivery and powders for inhalation<br>
Table 2<br>
The electrostatic charge of the dry powder inhalations for pulmonary delivery coated with<br>
an electrostatic aggregation-inhibiting substance was markedly reduced and their<br>
pulmonary delivery performance was significantly improved when compared to the<br>
uncoated powders for inhalation of the comparative examples (Table 2). Moreover, a<br>
good respirable fraction of 20% or higher was seen with an electrostatic charge of<br>
between 0 and 3 x 10-9Q.<br>
Test 3. Performance of pulmonary delivery of dry powder inhalation for pulmonary<br>
delivery produced using lactose carrier<br>
Respirable fraction of the dry powder inhalation for pulmonary delivery of<br>
Example 10 and the powder for inhalation prepared in Comparative Example 4 was<br>
determined by the twin impinger method (U.S. Pharmacopoeia, 23rd edition). An<br>
appropriate amount of the dry powder inhalation for pulmonary delivery was packed in<br>
an HPMC No. 2 capsule and charged in an inhalation device (Jethaler™ of Unisia Jecs<br>
Co., Ltd.). The amount of Compound A delivered to Stage 2 when air was drawn (60<br>
ml/min, 4 sec) from the device with the twin impinger was determined by HPLC. The<br>
amounts delivered to Stage 2 in contrast to the amount filled in the capsule served as the<br>
respirable fraction.<br>
Table 3. Results of the respirable fraction of powders for inhalation produced by mixing<br>
with lactose caiTier<br>
Table 3<br>
As shown in Table 3, surface-modified powders showed a high respirable fraction in<br>
comparison to biologically active substance microparticles that had not been surface-<br>
modified, even in the case of powders for inhalation that had been made using a carrier.<br>
It appears that in Comparative Example 4, there was very strong adhesive force of the<br>
biologically substance active microparticles to the carrier surface and that the respirable<br>
fraction was low because the biologically active substance particles could not be detached<br>
from the carrier surface during powder dispersion with the inhalation device. On the<br>
other hand, it appears that adhesive force to the carrier was reduced with the composition<br>
in Example 10 by surface modification of the biologically active substance microparticles,<br>
improving [particle] separation and dispersibility.<br>
Test 4. Results of stability tests during storage under harsh conditions (Example 4 vs<br>
Comparative Example 3)<br>
Appropriate amounts of both the dry powder inhalation for pulmonary delivery<br>
coated with hydrogenated lecithin having a phase transition temperature of 55°C<br>
(Example 4) and the powder for inhalation coated with egg yolk lecithin having a phase<br>
transition temperature of-15°C (Comparative Example 3) were filled into HPMC No. 2<br>
capsules and the state after storage for one week at 40°C was observed under a scanning<br>
electron microscope (SEM) (JSM-5400 of JEOL, Ltd.). As shown in Figure 1, there were<br>
no changes in the microparticles before storage and after storage with the dry powder<br>
inhalation for pulmonary delivery coated with hydrogenated lecithin having a phase<br>
transition temperature of 55°C. But, as shown in Figure 2, aggregation of microparticles<br>
occurred after storage at 40°C with the powder for inhalation coated with egg yolk<br>
lecithin, which has a phase transition temperature lower than 40°C.<br>
Test 5. Crystal state of dry powder inhalation for pulmonary delivery and powder for<br>
inhalation (Example 1 vs. Comparative Examples 1 and 5)<br>
The crystal state of the dry powder inhalation for pulmonary delivery and powder<br>
for inhalation was observed by the powder X-ray diffraction method, An appropriate<br>
amount of Compound A (free form) powder for inhalation that had been made by jet mill<br>
pulverization (Comparative Example 1) was charged in a powder X-ray diffraction<br>
device (RINT-1400 of Rigaku Denki) and determined under determination conditions<br>
(tube: Cu, tube voltage: 40 kV, tube cunent: 40 mA, scanning speed: 3.0°/min,<br>
wavelength: 1.54056 A). As shown in Figure 3, a peak based on the crystals of<br>
Compound A (free form) is seen, confirming a crystal state.<br>
When the dry powder inhalation for pulmonary delivery of Compound A jet mill-<br>
pulverized composition coated with cholesterol (Example 1) was similarly tested, the<br>
same peak as in Comparative Example 1 was seen, as shown in Figure 4, confirming that<br>
there are no changes in the crystal state, even with coating with cholesterol. Furthermore,<br>
when tests were performed by a powder for inhalation consisting of Compound A and<br>
cholesterol (Comparative Example 5), a peak derived from Compound A crystals was not<br>
seen, as shown in Figure 5, and [therefore] Compound A was present in amorphous form<br>
in the composition.<br>
Test 6. Results of stability tests during storage under harsh conditions (Example 1 vs.<br>
Comparative Example 5)<br>
The dry powder inhalation for pulmonary delivery of crystalline Compound A<br>
coated with cholesterol (Example 1) and the powder for inhalation of amorphous<br>
Compound A dispersed in cholesterol (Comparative Example 5) were stored for seven<br>
days at 40°C and 75% [RH]. The state before and after storage was observed under a<br>
scanning electron microscope (SEM) (JSM-5400 of JEOL, Ltd.). As shown in Figure 6,<br>
there were no changes in the morphology of the microparticles before storage and after<br>
storage, and there were hardly any changes in particle diameter as well, with the dry<br>
powder inhalation for pulmonary delivery of crystalline biologically active substance<br>
coated with cholesterol substance (Example 1). On the other hand, as shown in Figure 7,<br>
aggregation between particles occurred and there was the marked increase in particle<br>
diameter after storage under harsh conditions with the powder for inhalation consisting of<br>
amorphous biologically active substance (Comparative Example 5).<br>
Furthermore, an appropriate amount of each composition was filled in an HPMC<br>
No. 2 capsule and their respirable fraction was determined by the cascade impactor<br>
method (U.S. Pharmacopoeia, 24th edition) as in Test 2.<br>
Table 4. Stability during storage under harsh conditions<br>
Table 4<br>
As shown in Table 4, even after storage under harsh conditions, the dry powder<br>
inhalation for pulmonary delivery wherein a crystalline biologically active substance has<br>
been coated with cholesterol (Example 1) showed a low reduction in its respirable<br>
fraction and good pulmonary delivery performance. On the other hand, after storage<br>
under harsh conditions, the powder for inhalation made from amorphous biologically<br>
active substance (Comparative Example 5) showed a marked reduction in its respirable<br>
fraction that reflects an increase in particle diameter and was therefore inappropriate as<br>
an inhalation.<br>
Test 7: In vitro dissolution test method and results of dissolution tests of sustained-<br>
release dry powder inhalation for pulmonary delivery and powder for inhalation<br>
Test results<br>
The dissolution profile of compound A from the sustained-release dry powder<br>
inhalations for pulmonary delivery and powders for inhalation that were prepared in<br>
Examples I through 5 and 7 and Comparative Examples 1, 7, and 8 were evaluated using<br>
the Muranishi suppository release test device Desolise [transliteration] TDS-30P<br>
(Toyama Sangyo Co., Ltd.). The test conditions are as follows:<br>
Dissolution test fluid: 250 ml phosphate buffer with pH of 7 containing 0.2%<br>
Tween 80<br>
Liquid volume on donor side: 2 ml<br>
Agitation speed: 100 rpm<br>
Artificial membrane: Filter paper No. 1 (Advantec Toyo Kaisha, Ltd.)<br>
Dissolution tests of the dry powder inhalations for pulmonary delivery that were<br>
prepared in Examples 1 through 5 and 7 and Comparative Examples 1, 7 and 8 were<br>
conducted. There was continuous dissolution of the dry powder inhalations for<br>
pulmonary delivery that were obtained by coating compound A fine powder in crystal<br>
form with a hydrophobic base, with the respective dissolution rate of biologically active<br>
substance 30 minutes and 120 minutes after starting dissolution test being 13% and 28%<br>
in Example 1, 9% and 29% in Example 2, 18% and 46% in Example 3, 16% and 42% in<br>
Example 4, and 20% and 39%) in Example 7. On the other hand, there was fast<br>
dissolution of the uncoated composition in crystal form (Comparative Example 1,<br>
dissolution rate of biologically active substance 30 minutes and 120 minutes after starting<br>
test of 32% and 66%, respectively) and amorphous composition (Comparative Example 8,<br>
dissolution rate of biologically active substance 30 minutes and 120 minutes after starting<br>
test of 41% and 75%, respectively). Moreover, dissolution could not be controlled<br>
sufficiently with the dry powder inhalation for pulmonary delivery coated with the<br>
hydrophilic substance polyethylene glycol 4000 (Example 5, dissolution rate of<br>
biologically active substance 30 minutes and 120 minutes after starting test of 26% and<br>
57%, respectively). Furthermore, of the phospholipids, continuous dissolution was<br>
realized with the dry powder inhalation for pulmonary delivery coated with hydrogenated<br>
lecithin (Example 4), with the dissolution rate of biologically active substance 30 minutes<br>
and 120 minutes after starting the test being 16% and 42%, respectively, but dissolution<br>
could not be sufficiently controlled with the dry powder inhalation for pulmonary<br>
delivery coated with DPPC (Comparative Example 7), with the dissolution rate of<br>
biologically active substance 30 and 120 minutes after starting the test being 40% and<br>
65%, respectively. These results were completely unexpected findings.<br>
