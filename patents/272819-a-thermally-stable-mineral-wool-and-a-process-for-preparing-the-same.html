For information purposes only<br>
MINERAL WOOL, INSULATING PRODUCT AND PRODUCTION METHOD<br>
The present invention relates to the field of<br>
artificial mineral wools. It relates more particularly<br>
to mineral wools intended for manufacturing thermal<br>
and/or acoustic insulation materials or soilless<br>
cultivation substrates, and especially to thermally<br>
stable mineral wools intended for applications in which<br>
temperature resistance is important.<br>
These mineral wools are capable of playing an important<br>
role in the fire resistance of structural systems into<br>
which they are incorporated.<br>
The invention relates more particularly to mineral<br>
wools of the rock wool type, that is to say those in<br>
which the chemical compositions involve a high liquidus<br>
temperature and great fluidity at their fiberizing<br>
temperature, combined with a high glass transition<br>
temperature.<br>
Conventionally, this type of mineral wool is fiberized<br>
by what are termed "external" centrifugal processes,<br>
for example of the type of those using a cascade of<br>
spinning wheels supplied with molten material by a<br>
static delivery device, as described for example in<br>
Patent EP-0 465 310 or Patent EP-0 439 385.<br>
The fiberizing process termed "internal" centrifugal<br>
process, that is to say one making use of spinners<br>
rotating at high speed and pierced by orifices, is, in<br>
contrast, conventionally reserved for fiberizing<br>
mineral wool of the glass wool type, having broadly a<br>
composition relatively rich in alkali metal oxides and<br>
a low alumina content, a lower liquidus temperature,<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
the viscosity of the wool at the liquidus temperature<br>
being higher than that of rock wool or basalt wool.<br>
This process is described for example in Patent<br>
EP-0 189 354 or Patent EP-0 519 797.<br>
However, technical solutions allowing the internal<br>
centrifugal process to be adapted to the fiberizing of<br>
rock wool have recently been developed, especially by<br>
modifying the composition of the constituent material<br>
of the spinners and of their operating parameters. For<br>
more details on this subject, the reader may refer<br>
especially to patent WO 93/02977. Such adaptation<br>
consequently makes it possible to combine properties<br>
that hitherto have only been inherent to one or other<br>
of the two types of wool, namely rock wool or glass<br>
wool. Thus the rock wool obtained by an internal<br>
centrifugal process is of a quality comparable to that<br>
of glass wool, with a lower content of unfiberized<br>
particles than in conventionally obtained rock wool.<br>
However, it retains the two key advantages associated<br>
with its chemical nature, namely a low chemical<br>
material cost and a high temperature resistance.<br>
Two approaches are therefore now possible for<br>
fiberizing rock wool, the choice of one or other<br>
depending on a number of criteria, including the<br>
required level of quality for the intended application<br>
and that of industrial and economic feasibility.<br>
Added to these criteria has been, for a few years, that<br>
of a biodegradability of the mineral wool, namely its<br>
capability of rapidly dissolving in a physiological<br>
medium, with a view to preventing any potential<br>
pathogenic risk associated with the possible<br>
accumulation of the finest fibers in an organism by<br>
inhalation.<br>
Furthermore, a large number of mineral wool<br>
applications use the remarkable thermal stability<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
property that certain mineral wool compositions have.<br>
In particular, it is known that the thermal stability<br>
of mineral wool obtained from iron-enriched slag or<br>
basalt is known.<br>
The thermal stability of mineral wool is in particular<br>
essential for permitting its use in fire-resistant<br>
construction systems. One of the key points of fire<br>
resistance lies in the capability of the fiber blanket<br>
not collapsing (and in thus retaining its thermal<br>
insulation properties), this capability stemming from<br>
the fact that the fibers undergo no creep or sintering.<br>
Patent application WO 01/68546 discloses a mineral wool<br>
made thermally stable by the simultaneous use of a<br>
particular glass composition and of a phosphorus<br>
compound capable of reacting above 100°C with the<br>
fibers to form a refractory coating that limits both<br>
creep and sintering of the fibers.<br>
The phosphorus compounds described in that application<br>
are phosphates or polyphosphates, mainly ammonium or<br>
sodium phosphates or polyphosphates. These compounds,<br>
deposited with the binder on the surface of the fibers,<br>
react above 100°C with the surface of the fibers,<br>
releasing acid compounds, such as phosphoric acid<br>
and/or phosphoric anhydride, which react, depending on<br>
the particular chemical composition of the fibers, with<br>
the alkaline-earth ions of said fibers to form the<br>
above mentioned refractory coating on their surface.<br>
It appears that the implementation of the above<br>
invention is not without drawbacks in use. The<br>
phosphates disclosed in application WO 01/68546 are<br>
slightly sensitive, on the one hand, to moisture (when<br>
in the polyphosphate state) and, on the other hand, to<br>
temperature. The release of acid compounds at<br>
relatively low temperature seems to be prejudicial to<br>
adhesion between the fibers and the resin-based binder<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
(the resin of which is polymerized in an oven at<br>
temperatures of about 200°C) , and seems to be the<br>
origin of a reduction in the mechanical properties of<br>
the end product and above all in the long-term<br>
stability of said mechanical properties.<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to<br>
obviate the aforementioned drawbacks by improving the<br>
chemical composition of the fibers that mineral wool of<br>
the rock wool type contains, so as to give them the<br>
capability of being fiberized by the internal<br>
centrifugal process, improved mechanical and ageing<br>
properties, good thermal stability and good solubility<br>
properties in a physiological medium.<br>
The subject of the invention is a thermally stable<br>
mineral wool capable of dissolving in a physiological<br>
medium, which comprises fibers whose constituents are<br>
mentioned below, in the following percentages by<br>
weight :<br>
SiO2	35-60%, preferably 39-55%<br>
A12O3	12-27%, 	 16-25%<br>
CaO	0-35%, 	 3-25%<br>
MgO	0-30%, 	 0-15%<br>
Na2O	0-17%, 	 6-12%<br>
K2O	0-17%, 	 3-12%<br>
R20 (Na2O + K2O) 10-17%, 	 12-17%<br>
P2O5	0-5%, 	 0-2%<br>
Fe2O3	0-20%,<br>
B2O3	0-8%, 	 0-4%<br>
TiO2	0-3%,<br>
and which also includes at least one phosphorus<br>
compound capable of reacting at a temperature below<br>
1000°C with said fibers in order to form a coating on<br>
the surface of said fibers, said compound having a<br>
content, expressed by weight of phosphorus atoms<br>
varying from 0.0005%, especially more than 0.01% to 1%,<br>
but especially less than 0.5% of the total mass of the<br>
fibers, a phosphorus compound being a molecule in which<br><br>
- 5 -<br>
the phosphorus atom(s) is (are) linked to at least one<br>
carbon atom, directly or via an oxygen atom.<br>
Preferably, each phosphorus compound is a molecule in<br>
which the phosphorus atom(s) is (are) linked to at<br>
least one carbon atom, directly or via an oxygen atom-.<br>
Within the context of the present invention, the<br>
expression "thermally stable mineral wool" or "mineral<br>
wool having a thermal stability" is defined as being<br>
capable of exhibiting temperature resistance, that is<br>
to say capable of not slumping substantially when it is<br>
heated, especially up to temperatures of at least<br>
1000°C.<br>
In particular, a mineral wool is considered to be<br>
thermally stable if it meets the criteria defined by<br>
the draft standard "insulating materials: Thermal<br>
stability" as proposed by NORDTEST (NT FIRE XX-NORDTEST<br>
REMISS No. 1114-93).<br>
This test defines a procedure for determining the<br>
thermal stability of a specimen of insulating material<br>
at a temperature of 1000°C. A specimen of insulating<br>
material (measuring especially 25 mm in height by 25 mm<br>
in diameter) is introduced into a furnace but allows<br>
the slump of the specimen to be observed as a function<br>
of the temperature to which the specimen is exposed.<br>
The temperature of the furnace is increased at 5°C per<br>
minute from room temperature up to at least 1000°C.<br>
This draft standard defines an insulating material as<br>
being thermally stable if a specimen of this material<br>
slumps no more than 50% of its initial thickness before<br>
a temperature the 1000°C is reached.<br>
The coating formed on the surface of the high-<br>
temperature fibers has the remarkable property of being<br><br>
- 6 -<br>
refractory and thus retarding the slump of a specimen<br>
of fibers of the selected composition, heated to<br>
temperatures that may be up to 1000°C.<br>
The or each phosphorus compound may be a single<br>
molecule, that is to say, may contain' only one<br>
phosphorus atom.<br>
The phosphorus compound according to the invention may<br>
then be characterized in that the single phosphorus<br>
atom is directly linked only to oxygen or hydrogen<br>
atoms, that is to say, is linked to at least one carbon<br>
atom only by means of an oxygen atom. It may be, as an<br>
example, a mono-, di- or tri-phosphoric ester, or<br>
unsubstituted phosphonic or phosphinic esters, the<br>
carbon-based groups of these esters being alkyl, aryl,<br>
alkenyl, alkynyl, acyl or hydroxyalkyl compounds, which<br>
may possibly be of oligomeric or polymeric nature<br>
and/or contain one or more heteroatoms chosen from N, 0<br>
or S.<br>
It may alternatively be characterized in that the<br>
single phosphorus atom is directly linked to at least<br>
one carbon atom. It may be at least partially<br>
substituted phosphonic or phosphinic esters or acids<br>
(that is to say in which at least one of the hydrogen<br>
atoms linked to the phosphorus atom is substituted by a<br>
carbon-based substituent). The phosphorus compound in<br>
this case could equally be a mono-, di- or tri-<br>
phosphoric oxide. The various carbon-based groups of<br>
these compounds are alkyl, aryl, acyl or hydroxyalkyl<br>
compounds, which may possibly be of oligomeric or<br>
polymeric nature and/or contain one or more heteroatoms<br>
chosen from N, 0 or S.<br>
The or each phosphorus compound according to the<br>
invention is, however, preferably a molecule made up of<br>
several identical or different unitary compounds such<br>
as described previously, linked together by covalent<br><br>
- 7 -<br>
bonds. The phosphorus compound is then preferably an<br>
oligomer or polymer molecule, that is to say, that its<br>
structure may be represented as repeating constituent<br>
units. The number of these constituent units is<br>
advantageously between 2 and 100, especially 2 and 50,<br>
or even between 2 and 10. In the case of a molecule<br>
containing several phosphorus atoms, the key condition,<br>
in accordance with which the phosphorus atoms are<br>
linked to a carbon atom, must be seen as signifying<br>
that the large majority of the phosphorus atoms respect<br>
this condition, it being understood that, in a large<br>
molecule, the fact that a small fraction of the<br>
phosphorus atoms do not meet this condition is unable<br>
to substantially change the manner in which the<br>
technical problem is solved.<br>
It may thus be a compound in which the majority (or<br>
even all) of the phosphorus atoms are linked together<br>
by an oxygen atom, for example phosphoric or phosphonic<br>
polyester-type compounds.<br>
It is, however, more advantageous that the majority (or<br>
even all) of the phosphorus atoms be linked together<br>
via a carbon-based entity. The phosphorus compound then<br>
contains preferably a majority of phosphorus atoms<br>
linked together by a group comprising at least one<br>
carbon atom, this latter which may be linked directly<br>
or by means of an oxygen atom to at least one of the<br>
phosphorus atoms. Such a preferred compound may be<br>
represented according to the general formula (1) below:<br><br><br>
- 8 -<br>
- n is between 1 and 100, preferably between 1 and<br>
50, especially between 2 and 10; and<br>
the substituents R1 to R4 are identical or<br>
different, predominantly carbon-based entities,<br>
preferably of possibly branched alkyl, aryl, acyl or<br>
hydroxyalkyl type, which may possibly be of oligomeric<br>
or polymeric nature and/or contain one or more<br>
heteroatoms chosen from N, 0, S or P. It is preferable<br>
that at least one of these substituents, especially the<br>
substituent R1, contains an oxygen atom linked to the<br>
phosphorus atom of the main chain.<br>
If two of the substituents contain an oxygen atom<br>
linked to the phosphorus atom of the main chain, the<br>
phosphorus compound is advantageously a phosphonic<br>
polyester-type oligomer or polymer of general formula<br>
(2) below:<br><br>
When all the substituents contain an oxygen atom linked<br>
to the phosphorus atom of the main chain, another<br>
family of preferred phosphorus compounds is made up of<br>
phosphoric polyacid- or polyester-type oligomers or<br>
polymers of general formula (3) below:<br><br>
For these last two types of compounds:<br>
the chain length n is between 1 and 100,<br>
preferably between 1 and 50, especially between 2 and<br>
10;<br><br>
-9-<br>
- the substituents R2 and R5 to R8 are identical or<br>
different, predominantly carbon-based entities,<br>
preferably of possibly branched alkyl, aryl, acyl or<br>
hydroxyalkyl type, which may possibly be of oligomeric<br>
or polymeric nature and/or contain one or more<br>
heteroatoms chosen from N, 0, S or P. The number of<br>
carbon atoms in each substituent is advantageously<br>
between 1 and 15, especially between 2 and 10. A. large<br>
number of carbon atoms has in fact the disadvantage of<br>
generating a large quantity of carbon-based residues at<br>
the time of a temperature rise, whereas too small a<br>
number of carbon atoms may result in too easy a<br>
hydrolysis. The substituents R6 to R8 may also be<br>
hydrogen atoms or a neutralizing base for the<br>
phosphoric acid.<br>
When the chain length n is equal to 1, it is possible<br>
that the R5 and R6 groups be linked together covalently,<br>
thus forming a cyclic molecule. When n is greater than<br>
1, some R5, R6 or R7 groups may be linked together<br>
covalently. A preferred phosphorus compound is thus the<br>
product sold under the trademark AMGARD© CT or CU by<br>
Rhodia. It is a mixture of two cyclic phosphonic esters<br>
of CAS numbers 41203-81-0 and 42595-45-9 respectively.<br>
The first one is a phosphonic ester according to the<br>
formula (2) with n=l, all the R2 and R7 groups being<br>
methyl groups, the R5 and R6 groups being linked<br>
together to form a single alkyl group having 6 carbon<br>
atoms. The second one is an ester of the same type,<br>
with however n=2, all the R2 groups being methyl<br>
groups, the two R5 groups being respectively linked to<br>
the R6 and R7 groups to form two C6 alkyl groups.<br>
The oligomeric or polymeric phosphorus compounds,<br>
presented thus far as linear or cyclic chains, may also<br>
be crosslinked networks, the various predominantly<br>
carbon-based substituents being able to be themselves<br>
linked to at least one other phosphorus atom, for<br>
example when these substituents are polyols or<br><br>
- 10 -<br>
polyacids.<br>
The latter compounds may in particular be obtained by<br>
esterification or transesterification reactions between<br>
acids or esters, that are phosphonic and phosphoric<br>
respectively, and polyols (in particular diols),<br>
polyacids (in particular diacids) or else epoxy<br>
compounds. Within this scope, molasses (a by-product of<br>
sugar refining) are a particularly attractive source of<br>
polyols or diols due to their low cost. 1; appeared<br>
that the phosphorus compounds according to the<br>
invention were able to be obtained by reaction between<br>
molasses and the phosphoric or phosphonic acids or<br>
esters, this reaction which may even be carried out by<br>
simultaneously spraying the two products on the fibers.<br>
Phosphorus-based starches may also be employes.<br>
The mineral wool according to the invention ion may<br>
advantageously comprise a mixture of several phosphorus<br>
compounds such as described previously.<br>
The point that is common to these compounds, which<br>
could be termed "organophosphorus compounds", is the<br>
presence of carbon-based compounds within the<br>
phosphorus chain itself, which seems to bo the origin<br>
of the "blocking" of acid compounds, such at phosphoric<br>
acid, for temperatures below 200°C and therefore of the<br>
stability of these compounds against the effects of<br>
temperature and moisture.<br>
The phosphorus compound according to the invention is<br>
preferably present in an amount greater than or equal<br>
to 0.05%, especially 0.1%, and less than or equal to<br>
2%, especially 1%. This quantity corresponds to the<br>
mass of phosphorus compounds relative to the total mass<br>
of fibers.<br>
Considering the mass of phosphorus in there types of<br>
compounds, the mass content of phosphorus atoms<br><br>
- 11 -<br>
relative to the mass of fibers is advantageously<br>
between 0.0005% to 1%, especially greater than or equal<br>
to 0.01% and even 0.1% and less than or equal to 0.5%.<br>
The observed coating may be continuous on the surface<br>
of a fiber and its thickness is especially between 0.01<br>
and 0.05 urn.. Crystallization of a composition close to<br>
that of the coating may also be observed locally on the<br>
surface of the fibers and may reach thicknesses of<br>
around 0.1 to 0.5 m.<br>
According to one advantageous embodiment of the<br>
invention, the coating that can form on the surface of<br>
the mineral wool fibers potentially consists of an<br>
alkaline-earth metal phosphate.<br>
Coatings are thus obtained in which the composition is<br>
close to that of crystals of the alkaline-earth metal<br>
orthophosphate or pyrophosphate type, the melting point<br>
of which is known to be above 1000°C.<br>
Advantageously, the alkaline-earth metal phosphate that<br>
can form on the surface of the mineral wool fibers is a<br>
lime phosphate.<br>
Lime phosphates, especially orthophosphates	(Ca3(PO4)2,<br>
or pyrophosphate (Ca2P2O7) , are known to be	refractory<br>
and these compounds have melting points of	1670°C and<br>
1230°C respectively.<br>
As described in application WO 01/68546, a cooperative<br>
effect is observed between the fibers that form the<br>
subject of the selection of the above constituents and<br>
the phosphorus compounds. It may be considered that the<br>
phosphorus compound releases, at high temperature (but<br>
below 1000°C), phosphoric acid and/or phosphoric<br>
anhydride, which starts to react with the fibers of the<br>
composition according to the invention. In the case of<br>
these compositions, the high alkaline metal content<br><br>
- 12 -<br>
that they have may act as a compensator for the charge<br>
of aluminum, which is also present at high contents.<br>
Thus these are compositions in which the atomic<br>
mobility of the alkaline-earth metals is greater than<br>
that of these elements in other glass compositions.<br>
These relatively mobile alkaline-earth metals are then<br>
capable of reacting with the phosphoric acid or<br>
phosphoric anhydride to form a refractory compound,<br>
especially an alkaline-earth metal phosphate, and thus<br>
make it possible to ensure that the mineral wools<br>
according to the invention exhibit excellent thermal<br>
stability.<br>
Thermally stable mineral wool capable of being<br>
dissolved in a physiological medium is thus obtained.<br>
In the rest of the text, the term "composition" will<br>
refer to the ranges of the constituents of the fibers<br>
of the mineral wool, or of the glass intended to be<br>
fiberized in order to produce said fibers. Any<br>
percentage of a constituent of the composition must be<br>
understood to be a percentage by weight, and the<br>
compositions according to the invention may include up<br>
to 5%, especially 3%, of compounds considered as<br>
unanalyzed impurities, as is known in this kind of<br>
composition.<br>
According to	a variant of	the invention, the<br>
composition of the mineral wool is as follows:<br>
SiO2	• 39-55%,	preferably 40-52%<br>
A12O3	16-27%, 	 16-25%<br>
CaO	3-35%, 	 10-25%<br>
MgO	0-15%, 	 0-10%<br>
Na2O	0-15%, 	 6-12%<br>
K2O	0-15%, 	 3-12%<br>
R2O (Na2O	+ K2O) 10-17%, 	 12-17%<br>
P2O5	0-5%, 	 0-2%<br>
Fe2O3	0-15%,<br>
B2O3	0-8%, 	 0-4%<br><br>
- 13 -<br>
TiO2	0-3%,<br>
MgO being between 0 and 5%, especially between 0 and 2%<br>
when R2O13.0%.<br>
By selecting such a composition it is possible to<br>
combine the whole series of advantages, especially by<br>
varying the many complex roles that a number of its<br>
specific constituents play.<br>
Specifically, it has been found that the combination of<br>
a high alumina content, of between 16 and 27%,<br>
preferably greater than 17% and/or preferably less than<br>
25%, especially less than 22%, for a sum of network-<br>
forming elements, namely silica and alumina, of between<br>
57 and 75%, preferably greater than 60% and/or<br>
preferably less than 72%, especially 70%, with a high<br>
quantity of alkali metals (R2O: sodium and potassium)<br>
between 10 and 17%, with MgO between 0 and 5%,<br>
especially between 0 and 2%, when R2O13.0%, makes it<br>
possible to obtain glass compositions possessing the<br>
remarkable property of being fiberizable within a very<br>
wide range of temperatures and imparting biosolubility<br>
in acid pH on the fibers obtained. According to<br>
embodiments of the invention, the alkali metal content<br>
is preferably greater than 12%, especially 13.0% and<br>
13.3%, and/or preferably less than 15%, especially less<br>
than 14.5%.<br>
This compositional range proves to be particularly<br>
beneficial as it has been observed, contrary to<br>
received opinion, that the viscosity of the molten<br>
glass does not decrease significantly with an increase<br>
in alkali metal content. This remarkable effect makes<br>
it possible to increase the difference between the<br>
temperature corresponding to the viscosity for<br>
fiberizing and the liquidus temperature of the phase<br>
that crystallizes, and thus to considerably improve the<br>
fiberizing conditions and especially makes it possible<br>
to fiberize a new family of biosoluble glasses by<br><br>
- 14 -<br>
internal centrifugation.<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention, the<br>
compositions have an iron oxide content of between 0<br>
and 5%, especially greater than 0.5%, and/or less than<br>
3%, especially less than 2.5%. Another embodiment is<br>
obtained with compositions that have an iron oxide<br>
content of between 5 and 12%, especially between 5 and<br>
8%, thereby making it possible to obtain fire-resistant<br>
mineral wool blankets.<br>
Advantageously, the compositions according to the<br>
invention satisfy the relationship: (Na2O + K2O)/A12O3) &gt;<br>
0.5, preferably (Na2O + K2O) / A12O3) &gt; 0.6, especially<br>
(Na2O + K2O) / A12O3) &gt; 0.7, which appears to favor the<br>
temperature corresponding to the viscosity for<br>
fiberizing higher than the liquidus temperature being<br>
obtained.<br>
According to a variant of the invention, the<br>
compositions according to the invention preferably have<br>
a line content of between 10 and 25%, especially<br>
greater than 12%, preferably greater than 15%, and/or<br>
preferably less than 23%, especially less than 20% and<br>
even less than 17%, combined with a magnesia content of<br>
between 0 and 5%, preferably with less than 2%<br>
magnesia, especially less than 1% magnesia, and/or a<br>
magnesia content greater than 0.3%, especially greater<br>
than 0.5%.<br>
According to another variant, the magnesia content is<br>
between 5 and 10% for a line content between 5 and 15%,<br>
and preferably between 5 and 10%.<br>
By adding P2O5, which is optional, with contents of<br>
between 0 and 3%, especially greater than 0.5% and/or<br>
less than 2%, makes it possible to increase the<br>
biosolubility in neutral pH. Optionally, the<br>
composition may also contain boron oxide, which may<br><br>
- 15 -<br>
help to improve the thermal properties of the mineral<br>
wool, especially by tending to lower its thermal<br>
conductivity coefficient in the radiative component and<br>
also to increase the biosolubility in neutral pH. It<br>
may also include TiO2 in the composition, optionally,<br>
for example up to 3%. Other oxides, such as BaO, SrO,<br>
MnO, Cr2O3, ZrO2 and SO3 may be present in the<br>
composition, with a total content not exceeding 5%,<br>
preferably about 3 or 2%, and even 1%. These various<br>
oxides may be intentionally added to the composition<br>
according to the invention, but in general they are<br>
present as inevitable impurities resulting from the<br>
batch materials, from the refractory materials in<br>
contact with the glass, or from the refining agents<br>
employed to reduce the amount of gaseous inclusions in<br>
the mass of molten glass.<br>
According to one particularly preferred embodiment of<br>
the invention, the mineral wool comprises fibers whose<br>
constituents are mentioned below, in the	following<br>
percentages by weight:<br>
SiO2	39-55%, preferably	40-52%<br>
A12O3	16-27%, 		16-26%<br>
CaO	6-20%, 		8-18%<br>
MgO	0-5%, 		1-4.9%<br>
Na2O	0-15%, 		2-12%<br>
K2O	0-15%, 		2-12%<br>
R2O (Na2O + K2O) 10-14.7%, 		10-13.5%<br>
P2O5	0-3%, especially	0-2%<br>
Fe2O3 (total iron) 1.5-15%, 		3.2-8%<br>
B2O3	0-2%, preferably	0-1%<br>
TiO2	0-2%, 		0.4-1%.<br>
These compositions by themselves have a remarkably<br>
improved high-temperature behavior.<br>
It would seem that this composition range makes it<br>
possible for crystallization seeds to be nucleated at<br>
low temperature, these seeds causing the appearance or<br><br>
- 16 -<br>
the growth of crystals at a sufficiently low<br>
temperature at which the softening or sintering of the<br>
material is not yet able to be effective. It may be<br>
considered that, by crystallizing components more<br>
fusible than the overall glass composition, the<br>
viscosity of the residual glass increases and the<br>
surface forces involved for sintering are no longer<br>
high enough to prevail over the viscous cohesion<br>
forces.<br>
Preferably, the alumina is present in an amount of 17<br>
to 25.5%, especially 20 to 25%, in particular 21 to<br>
24.5% and especially around 22 to 23 or 24% by weight.<br>
Advantageously, good refractoriness may be obtained by<br>
adjusting the magnesia content, especially to at least<br>
1.5%, in particular 2%, especially greater than or<br>
equal to 2.5% or 3%. A high magnesia content is<br>
conducive to a low-temperature crystallizing effect<br>
that opposes the lowering of viscosity generally<br>
observed at high temperature, and therefore prevents<br>
the material from sintering.<br>
One advantageous composition selection consists in<br>
providing the required minimum amount of magnesia, this<br>
being greater the lower the amount of alumina.<br>
Thus, when the alumina is present in an amount of at<br>
least 22% by weight, the amount of magnesia is<br>
preferably at least 1%, advantageously around 1 to 4%,<br>
preferably 1 to 2% and in particular 1.2 to 1.6%. The<br>
alumina content is preferably limited to 25% in order<br>
to preserve a sufficiently low liquidus temperature.<br>
When the alumina is present in a lower amount, for<br>
example around 17 to 22%, the amount of magnesia is<br>
preferably at least 2%, especially around 2 to 5%.<br>
The lime is advantageously present at contents of<br>
between 9.5 and 20%, preferably between 10 and 18% and<br><br>
- 17 -<br>
even more preferably from 11 to 16%.<br>
The total amount of lime and magnesia may<br>
advantageously be around 14 to 20%, especially 15 to<br>
19%.<br>
The total amount of alkaline-earth metal oxides (lime,<br>
magnesia, barium oxide and strontium oxide) is<br>
preferably between 10 and 20%, especially from 12 to<br>
18%.<br>
The amount of silica is advantageously around 35 to<br>
50%, especially 37 to 48% and more particularly 39 to<br>
4 4%, by weight.<br>
Depending on the embodiments of the invention, the<br>
alkali metal oxide content is preferably less than or<br>
equal to 13.2%, or even 13.0%, especially around 10 to<br>
12.5% and in particular 10.2 to 12% or Jess.<br>
Sodium oxide and potassium oxide may each be present in<br>
an amount of 3 to 9% by weight.<br>
Within this range of alkali metal oxide contents, it<br>
proves advantageous to choose a ratio of the alkali<br>
metal oxide content to alumina content such that the<br>
R2O/Al2O3 molar ratio is less than 1, in particular less<br>
than 0.9, especially at most 0.8 and in particular at<br>
most 0.75.<br>
When the molar ratio is greater than 0.9, it is<br>
preferable for the magnesia content to be high enough<br>
to produce a low-temperature crystallizing effect, for<br>
example at least 2%, or at least 2.5%, otherwise<br>
excessively low glass transition temperatures would be<br>
obtained, with a deleterious effect on the behavior at<br>
very high temperature.<br>
An R2O/Al2O3 molar ratio of less than 0.9 produces a<br>
favorable effect on refractoriness, in particular at<br><br>
- 18 -<br>
low temperature, and therefore on the softening point<br>
and the sintering temperature.<br>
However, within this composition range a sufficiently<br>
large difference is maintained between the temperature<br>
corresponding to the viscosity for fiberizing and the<br>
liquidus temperature of the phase that crystallizes -<br>
thus giving good fiberizing conditions.<br>
The iron oxide present in the composition has a<br>
positive impact on the nucleation of growth of seeds at<br>
low temperature, while still limiting the liquidus.<br>
However, its amount is preferably limited so as not to<br>
adversely affect biosolubility in acid medium. In a<br>
preferred embodiment of the invention, the compositions<br>
have iron oxide contents of between 2 and 6%,<br>
preferably around 3 to 6%.<br>
The titanium oxide provides a very noticeable effect on<br>
the nucleation at high and low temperature of spinels<br>
within the glassy matrix. A content of the order of 1%<br>
or less may prove to be advantageous.<br>
P2O5 may be used, at contents of between 0 and 3%,<br>
especially between 0.1 and 1.2%, to increase the<br>
biosolubility at neutral pH.<br>
Other oxides, such as BaO, SrO, MnO, Cr2O3 and ZrO2, may<br>
be present in the composition, with a maximum total<br>
content of 5%, or even 2%, and even 1%.<br>
The difference between the temperature corresponding to<br>
a viscosity of 102'5 poise (decipascal.second) , denoted<br>
by T1og2.5, and the liquidus of the crystallizing phase,<br>
denoted by Tliq, is preferably at least 10°C. This<br>
difference, Tlog2.5 - Tiiq, defines the "working range"<br>
for the compositions of the invention, that is to say<br>
the temperature range within which fiberization is<br>
possible, most particularly by an internal centrifugal<br><br>
- 19 -<br>
process. This difference is preferably at least 20 or<br>
30°C, and even more than 50°C, especially more than<br>
100°C.<br>
The compositions according to	the invention have high<br>
glass transition temperatures,	especially above 600°C.<br>
Their annealing temperature,	denoted by Tannealing, is<br>
especially above 600°C.<br>
As mentioned above, the mineral wool exhibits a<br>
satisfactory level of biosolubility especially at acid<br>
pH. It thus has in general a rate of dissolution,<br>
especially measured on silica, of at least 30 and<br>
preferably at least 40 or 50 ng/cm2 per hour measured<br>
at pH 4.5 using a method similar to that described in<br>
the NF T 03-410 standard.<br>
Another very important advantage of the invention<br>
relates to the possibility of using inexpensive batch<br>
materials to obtain the composition of these glasses.<br>
These compositions may especially result from the<br>
melting of rock, for example of the phonolite type,<br>
with an alkaline-earth metal carrier, for example<br>
limestone or dolomite, if necessary supplemented with<br>
iron ore. By this means, a moderate-cost alumina<br>
carrier is obtained.<br>
This type of composition, with a high alumina content<br>
and a high alkali metal oxide content, may<br>
advantageously be melted in fired glass furnaces or<br>
electric glass furnaces.<br>
The subject of the invention is also a process for<br>
obtaining mineral wool according to the invention,<br>
which includes a step of fiber-forming followed by a<br>
step of supplying, especially by spraying or<br>
impregnation of a solution, at least one phosphorus<br>
compound onto the surface of said fibers.<br><br>
- 20 -<br>
The subject of the invention is also a thermal and/or<br>
acoustic insulation product comprising at least one<br>
mineral wool according to the invention.<br>
The invention also relates to the use of the mineral<br>
wool described above in fire-resistant structural<br>
systems.<br>
The expression "fire-resistant structural systems" is<br>
understood to mean systems generally comprising<br>
assemblies of materials, especially based on mineral<br>
wool and metal plates, that can effectively retard the<br>
propagation of heat and also provide protection against<br>
flames and hot gases and maintain mechanical strength<br>
during a fire.<br>
Standardized tests define the degree of fire<br>
resistance, expressed especially as the time needed for<br>
a given temperature to be reached on the opposite side<br>
of the structural system that is exposed to a heat flux<br>
generated, for example, by the flames of a burner or by<br>
an electric furnace.<br>
A structural system is considered to exhibit<br>
satisfactory fire resistance if it is able in<br>
particular to meet the requirements of one of the<br>
following tests:<br>
fire door test: tests on mineral fiber boards,<br>
as defined in the German standard DIN 18 089 - Part 1<br>
(or equivalent);<br>
- fire behavior of building materials and<br>
elements, as defined in the German standard DIN 4102<br>
(or equivalent). In particular, the standard DIN 4102 -<br>
Part 5 is considered for full-scale tests so as to<br>
determine the fire resistance class, and/or the<br>
standard DIN 4102 - Part 8 for tests on specimens with<br>
a small test bed; and<br>
normalized test OMI A 754 (18) (or equivalent),<br>
which describes the general fire resistance test<br><br>
- 21 -<br>
requirements for "marine"-type applications, especially<br>
for ship bulkheads. These tests are carried out on<br>
large specimens, with 3 m by 3 m furnaces. Mention may<br>
be made, for example, of the case of a steel deck on<br>
which the required performance in the case of a fire on<br>
the insulation side is to meet the thermal insulation<br>
criterion for at least 60 minutes.<br>
Other details and advantageous features will become<br>
apparent from the description below of nonlimiting<br>
preferred embodiments.<br>
Table 1 below gives the compositions of the fibers, in<br>
percentages by weight, of sixty examples.<br>
The "impurities" line corresponds to the inevitable<br>
impurities resulting from the batch materials, from the<br>
refining agents or from the refractory materials in<br>
contact with the molten glass, treated globally. Only<br>
their total content is indicated, purely by way of<br>
indication, as neither their content, in general less<br>
than 2%, or even less than 1%, nor their nature affect<br>
the way in which the examples according to the<br>
invention solve the stated problem.<br>
The compositions according to these examples can be<br>
fiberized by an internal centrifugal process,<br>
especially according to the teaching of the<br>
aforementioned Patent WO 93/02977.<br>
Their working ranges, defined by the difference<br>
T1Og2.5 - Tliq, are largely positive, especially greater<br>
than 50°C, or even 100°C and even greater than 150°C.<br>
The liquidus temperatures are relatively low,<br>
especially not exceeding 1200°C and even 1150°C.<br>
The temperatures (Tlog2.5) corresponding to viscosities<br>
of 102.5 poise are compatible with the use of<br><br>
 - 22 -<br>
centrifugal spinners for high-temperature fiberizing,<br>
especially under the operating conditions described in<br>
Application WO 93/02977.<br>
The preferred compositions are in particular those in<br>
which T1Og2.5 is less than 1350°C, preferably less than<br>
1300°C.<br>
Table 1 also indicates the annealing temperature<br>
(expressed in °C) and the rate of dissolution of the<br>
fibers at pH 4.5 (expressed in ng/cm2.h). The latter<br>
quantity, measured according to the protocol indicated<br>
in standard NF T 03-410, is greater than 30 ng/cm2.h.<br>
To illustrate the present invention, various phosphorus<br>
compounds were added during the fiberizing process, by<br>
spraying them, in a zone located after the zone in<br>
which the fibers are attenuated from the molten glass<br>
and before the zone in which the mineral wool is<br>
collected. The term "adjuvants" refers to the compounds<br>
added in this spraying zone, which adjuvants may be<br>
supplied simultaneously or separately.<br>
The composition of example 45 of Table 1 was fiberized<br>
by the internal centrifugal process with or without the<br>
presence of various phosphorus-based compounds, in<br>
order to obtain mineral wool blankets, and the results<br>
of mechanical thermo stability tests are given in<br>
Table 2.<br>
In these tests, the adjuvant comprises a resin-based<br>
binder and, in certain examples, a phosphorus compound<br>
added to this binder and sprayed at the same time as<br>
the latter.<br>
The resin-based binders, well-known in the mineral wool<br>
field, have the function of giving the fiber blanket<br>
the desired mechanical strength. Within the context of<br>
the present tests, a standard binder based on a phenol-<br><br>
- 23 -<br>
formaldehyde resin and urea has been employed. Other<br>
types of sizing composition, in particular those that<br>
are formaldehyde-free, may, of course, also be used,<br>
alone or in mixtures. They may be for example:<br>
-	compositions based on an epoxy resin of the<br>
glycidyl ether type and a non-volatile amine hardener<br>
(described in Application EP-A-0 369 848), which may<br>
also comprise an accelerator chosen from imidazoles,<br>
imidazolines and mixtures thereof;<br>
compositions comprising a carboxylic polyacid<br>
and a polyol, preferably combined with a catalyst of<br>
the alkali metal salt of a phosphorus-containing<br>
organic acid type (described in Application EP-A-0 990<br>
727);<br>
compositions comprising one or more compounds<br>
incorporating a carboxylic functional group and/or a<br>
-hydroxyaikylamide functional group (described in<br>
Application WO-A-93/36368);<br>
-	compositions incorporating either a carboxylic<br>
acid and an alkanolamine, or a resin previously<br>
synthesized from a carboxylic acid and from an<br>
alkanoiamine, and a polymer containing a carboxylic<br>
acid group (described in Application EP-A-1 164 163);<br>
sizing compositions prepared in two steps<br>
consisting in mixing an anhydride and an amine under<br>
reactive conditions until the anhydride is<br>
substantially dissolved in the amine. and/or has reacted<br>
with it, then in adding water and terminating the<br>
reaction (described in Application EP-A-1 170 265) ;<br>
-	compositions containing a resin that comprises<br>
the polymer-free reaction product of an amine with a<br>
first anhydride and a second anhydride that is<br>
different from the first (described in Application EP-<br>
A-1 086 932);<br>
compositions containing at least one<br>
polycarboxylic acid and at least one polyamine;<br>
-	compositions comprising copolymers of carboxylic<br>
acid and of monomers containing alcohol functional<br>
groups such as described in Application US 2005/038193;<br><br>
- 24 -<br>
and<br>
-	compositions comprising polyols and polyacids or<br>
polyanhydrides such as maleic acid, described for<br>
example in Patent WO 2005/87837 or in Application<br>
US 6 706 808.<br>

Aminoplast type resins (melamine-formaldehyde or urea-<br>
formaldehyde) may also be used within the scope of. the<br>
invention.<br>
Comparative example A contained no phosphorus compounds<br>
and there formed only the resin-based binder as<br>
adjuvant.<br>
In the case of the other examples, six different<br>
phosphorus compounds were employed. The first three<br>
were mineral phosphates or polyphosphates quite similar<br>
to those described in application WO 01/68546 and were<br>
employed in comparative examples B, C and D. These were<br>
the following:<br>
sodium metaphosphate. Comparative example B<br>
contained 0.2% thereof;<br>
-	a flame retardant with the trade name "EXOLIT AP<br>
4 62" produced by Clariant GmbH. Based on a ammonium<br>
polyphosphate and melamine, it is especially used to<br>
improve the fire resistance of polymers (polyurethanes,<br>
epoxy resins) and has a very low water solubility.<br>
Comparative example C contained 0.2% thereof; and<br>
-	a flame retardant with the brand name "FR CROS<br>
489" sold by Buddenheim (CAS No. 68333-79-9) . This<br><br>
- 25 -<br>
product is an ammonium polyphosphate containing 64%<br>
phosphorus expressed in P2O5 form. Comparative example D<br>
contained 0.2% thereof.<br>
The other three phosphorus compounds were<br>
"organophosphorus" compounds employed within the<br>
context of the present invention. These were the<br>
following:<br>
-	a flame retardant with the trade name "EXOLIT OP<br>
550" produced by Clariant GmbH. Based on a phosphoric<br>
polyester type oligomer, it is especially used as an<br>
agent for protecting polyurethanes against: fire.<br>
Examples E, F and G according to the invention<br>
respectively contained 0.3%, 0.5% and 0.7% of it<br>
relative to the total mass of fibers; and<br>
-	a flame retardant with a brand name "EXOLIT OP<br>
560" produced by Clariant GmbH. Based on an oligomer of<br>
the phosphonic polyester type, it is employed in<br>
particular as an agent for protecting polyurethanes<br>
against fire. Example H according to the invention<br>
contained 0.5% thereof; and<br>
-	a flame retardant with the trade name "FYROL<br>
PNX" sold by Akzo Nobel, containing 19% of P2O5. It; is a<br>
phosphoric polyester type oligomer of formula (3) in<br>
which n varies between 2 and 20, R6, R7 and RB are ethyl<br>
groups and R5 is an ethylene group (CAS number 184538-<br>
58-7). Example I according to the invention contained<br>
0.8% of it.<br>
These three compounds contain phosphorus atoms and<br>
carbon-containing entities, in particular of the alkyl<br>
type, in their main chain.<br>
Among other examples of phosphorus compounds according<br>
to the invention are the products BUDIT 341 or 3118F<br>
sold by Buddenheim. The mixture of cyclic phosphonic<br>
esters sold under the trademark AMGARD© CT or CU by<br>
Rhodia is also particularly interesting. This product,<br>
used as a fire retardant for polyester-based textiles,<br><br>
- 26 -<br>
has in fact a higher stability than the product EXOLIT<br>
OP 550 at the temperature of the oven, and thus makes<br>
it possible to obtain better mechanical properties<br>
before aging. Its P2O5 content is about 20%.<br>
Table 2 gives, for all of these tests, the initial<br>
mechanical strength of the mineral wool products<br>
obtained and the loss of their mechanical strength (as<br>
a relative percentage) after ageing in an autoclave at<br>
105°C under a pressure of 1.5 bar for 15 minutes, and<br>
for some of these tests the slump at 1000°C, according<br>
to the draft standard "insulating materials: thermal<br>
stability" mentioned above.<br>
The mechanical strength was measured before and after<br>
autoclave ageing by tensile tests carried out on<br>
specimens in the form of rings cut from the fibrous<br>
products with a density of 14 kg/m3. According to this<br>
test, two pins were introduced into the center of the<br>
ring and moved apart at a constant rate until the<br>
specimen broke. This strength, expressed in N/g,<br>
corresponds to the force at break divided by the mass<br>
of the specimen. The test was repeated on twenty<br>
specimens, the average of the results obtained being<br>
indicated in the table.<br><br>
- 27 -<br>
Table 2<br><br>
These results clearly show that the addition of<br>
phosphorus compounds such as those described in the<br>
prior art (examples B, C and D) do not improve the<br>
initial mechanical strength properties or degrade them<br>
(upon leaving the oven) and also greatly degrade the<br>
variation in these properties over time compared with<br>
the case in which no phosphorus compound was added<br>
(example A).<br>
In contrast, the use of the phosphorus compounds within<br>
the context of the present invention, on the one hand,<br>
improves the initial mechanical properties of the<br>
product and, on the other hand, either does not degrade<br>
the variation in these properties after accelerated<br>
ageing (examples F, H and I) or even improves them<br>
(examples E and G) .<br>
Without wishing to be tied by any scientific theory,<br>
the beneficial effect of adding the compounds according<br>
to the invention seems to be due to the absence of acid<br>
compounds being liberated, such as phosphoric acid<br>
and/or phosphoric anhydride, during the oven treatment<br>
for curing the resin of the binder and during the<br>
accelerated ageing treatment on the end product. This<br>
is because it seems that the liberation of acid<br>
compounds causes the adhesion between the binder and<br><br>
- 28 -<br>
the glass fibers to be reduced and/or attacks the<br>
surface of the fibers. It has also been demonstrated<br>
independently of the present invention that the<br>
addition of a base (such as MgO) as additional adjuvant<br>
makes it possible to neutralize the acids formed during<br>
this binder curing step and offers advantages with<br>
regard to the variation in mechanical properties over<br>
time of the products thus formed.<br>
The beneficial effect of all these types of phosphates<br>
(comparative example B or examples E and I according to<br>
the invention) on the thermal stability is also<br>
confirmed, the slump at 1000°C being reduced by at<br>
least a factor of two compared with that of fibers<br>
without phosphate compounds.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
