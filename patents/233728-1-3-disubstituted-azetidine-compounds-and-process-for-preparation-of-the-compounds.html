the invention also provides a compound of formula la or Ib in free or pharmaceuticaUy acceptable salt form for use as a pharmaceutical. The agents of the invention act as CCR-3 receptor antagonists, thereby inhibiting the infiltration and activation of inflammatory cells, particularly eosinophils, and inhibiting allergic response. Tlie inhibitory properties of agents of the invention can be demonstrated in the following assay:<br>
In this assay the effect of agents of the invention on the binding of human eotaxin to human CCR-3 is determined- Recombinant cells expressing human CCR-3 are captured by wheatgerm agglutinin (WGA) polyvinyltoluidene (PVT) SPA beads (available from Amersham), through a specific interaction between the WGA and carbohydrate residues of glycoproteins on the surface of the cells. [12SI]-human eotaxin (available from Amersham) binds specifically to CCR-3 receptors bringing the ["^-human eotaxin in dose proximity to the SPA beads. Emitted a-particles from the [125I]-human eotaxin excite^ by its proximity, the fluorophore in the beads and produce light. Free [125I]-human eotaxin in solution is not in close proximity to the scintillant and hence does not produce light. The scintillation count is therefore a measure of the extent to which the test compound inhibits binding of the eotaxin to the CCR-3.<br>
Preparation of Assay Buffer: 5.96 g HEPES and 7.0 g sodium chloride are dissolved in distilled water and 1M aqueous CaCb (1 ml) and 1M aqueous MgCb (5 ml) are added. The pH is adjusted to 7.6 with NaOH and the solution made to a final volume of 1 L using distilled water. 5 g bovine serum albumin and 0.1 g sodium azide are then dissolved in the solution and the resulting buffer stored at 4°C. A Complete™ protease inhibitor cocktail tablet (available from Boehringer) is added per 50 ml of the buffer on the day of use.<br>
Preparation of Homogenisation Buffer: Tris-base (2.42 g) is dissolved in distilled water, the pH of the solution is adjusted to 7.6 with hydrochloric acid and the solution is diluted with distilled water to a final volume of 1 L The resulting buffer is stored at 4°C. A Complete™ protease inhibitor cocktail tablet is added per 50 ml of the buffer on the day of use.<br>
Preparation of membranes: Confluent rat basophil leukaemia (RBL-2H3) cells stably expressing CCR3 are removed from tissue culture flasks using enzyme-free cell dissociation buffer and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline. The cells are centrifuged (800 g, 5 minutes), the pellet resuspended in ice-cold homogenisation buffer using 1 ml homogenisation buffer per gram of cells and incubated on ice for 30 minutes. The cells are homogenised on ice with 10 strokes in a glass mortar and pestle. The homogenate is centrifuged (800 g, 5 minutes,<br><br>
WO 2005/026113	PCT/EP2004/010260<br>
4°C), the supernatant further centrifuged (48,000 g, 30 minutes, 4°C) and the pellet redissolved in Homogenisation Buffer containing 10% (v/v) glyceroL The protein content of the membrane preparation is estimated by the method of Bradford (Anal Biocbem. (1976) 72:248) and aliquots are snap frozen and stored at-80°C<br>
The assay is performed in a final volume of 250 pi per well of an Optiplate™ microplate (ex Canberra Packard). To selected wells of.the microplate are added 50 pi of solutions of a test compound in Assay Buffer containing 5 % DMSO (concentrations from 0.01 nM to 10 pM). To determine total binding, 50 pi of the Assay Buffer containing 5 % DMSO is added to other selected wells. To determine non-specific binding, 50 pi of 100 nM human eotaxin (ex R&amp;D Systems) in Assay Buffer containing 5 % DMSO is added to further selected wells. To all wells are added 50 pi [U5I]-Human eotaxin (ex Amersham) in Assay Buffer containing 5 % DMSO at a concentration of 250 pM (to give a final concentration of 50 pM per well), 50 pi of WGA-PVT SPA beads in Assay Buffer (to give a final concentration of 1.0 mg beads per well) and 100 pi of the membrane preparation at a concentration of 100 pg protein in Assay Buffer (to give a final concentration of 10 pg protein per well). The plate is then incubated for 4 hours at room temperature. The plate is sealed using TopSeal-S™ sealing tape (ex Canberra Packard) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting scintillations are counted using a Canberra Packard TopCount™ scintillation counter, each well being counted for 1 minute. The concentration of test compound at which 50% inhibition occurs (IC50) is determined from concentration-inhibition curves in a conventional manner.<br>
"The compounds of the Examples hereinbelow generally have IC50 values below 1 \xM in the above assay. For instance, the compounds of Examples 1,19,25, 31, 73, 94 and 131 have IC50 values of 0.278, 0.002, 0.820, 0.117, 0.136, 0.124 and 0.096 pM respectively.<br>
Most of the compounds of the Examples exhibit selectivity for inhibition of CCR-3 binding relative to inhibition of binding of the aipha-1 adrenergic receptor. Some of the compounds e.g. those of Example 19 and 31, are also histamine HI antagonists.<br>
The inhibitory properties of agents of the invention on binding of the alpha-1 adrenergic receptor can be determined in the following assay:<br>
Cerebral cortices from male Sprague-Dawley rats (175-200 g) are dissected and homogenised in 10 volumes of ice cold 0.32 M sucrose (containing 1 mM MgCb dihydrate and lmM<br><br>
WO 2005/026113	PCT/EP2004/010260<br>
K2HPO4) widi a glass/Teflon homogeniser. The membranes are centrifuged at 1000 x g for 15 miN, the pellet discarded and the centrifugation repeated. The supernatants are pooled and centrifuged at 18,000 x g for 15 minutes. The pellet is osmotically shocked in 10 volumes of water and kept on ice for 30 minutes. The suspension is centrifuged at 39,000 x g for 20 minutes, resuspended in Krebs-Henseleit buffer pH 7.4 (1.17 mM MgSCU anhydrous, 4.69 mM KC1, 0.7 mM K2HPO4 anhydrous, 0.11 M Nad, 11 mM D-glucose and 25 mM NaHCO3) containing 20 mM Tris, and kept for 2 days at -20°C. The membranes are then thawed at 20-23°C, washed three times with Krebs-Henseleit buffer by centrifugation at 18,000 x g for 15 minutes, left overnight at 4°C and washed again three times. The final pellet is resuspended with a glass/Teflon homogeniser in 125 ml/100 membranes in die same buffer. A sample is taken to determine the protein concentration (using the Bradford Assay with gamma globulin as the standard) and the remainder aliquoted and stored at -80°C.<br>
The resulting membranes are subjected to a radioligand binding assay. The assay is conducted in triplicate using 96 well plates containing P5IJ-HEAT (Amersham) (40 pM, Ka: 58.9 ± 18.7 pM), unlabelled test compound and membrane (57.1 Jig/ml) to yield a final volume of 250 \J&amp; (assay buffer containing 50 mM Tris-base and 0.9% (w/v) NaCl, pH 7.4). The plates are incubated at 37°C for 60 minutes, after which rapid vacuum filtration over Whatman™ GF/C 96 well filter plates is carried out. Each plate is then washed three times with 10ml of ice cold assay buffer using a Brandel Cell harvester (Gaithersburg, MD). Following drying of the plates for 3 L at 50°C, 40 \d of Microscint 20 is added to each well, the plates incubated at room temperature for a further 20 minutes and die retained radioactivity quantified in a Packard TopCountNXI™ scintillation counter.<br>
Stock solutions of test compounds are dissolved initially in 100 % DMSO and diluted with assay buffer to die required concentrations to yield 1 % (v/v) DMSO. TTie concentration of test compound at which 50% inhibition occurs (IC50) is determined from concentration-inhibition curves in a conventional manner.<br>
Having regard to their inhibition of binding of CCR-3, agents of die invention are useful in the treatment of conditions mediated by CCR-3, particularly inflammatory or allergic conditions. Treatment in accordance with the invention may be symptomatic or prophylactic<br>
Accordingly, agents of the invention are useful in die treatment of inflammatory or obstructive airways diseases, resulting, for example, in reduction of tissue damage, bronchial hyper-<br><br>

reactivity, remodelling or disease progression. Inflammatory or obstructive airways diseases to which the present invention is applicable include asthma of whatever type or genesis including both intrinsic (non-allergic) asthma and extrinsic (allergic) asthma, mild asthma, moderate asthma, severe asthma, bronchitic asthma, exercise-induced asthma, occupational asthma and asthma induced following bacterial or viral infection. Treatment of asthma is also to be understood as embracing treatment of subjects, e.g. of less than 4 or 5 years of age, exhibiting wheezing symptoms and diagnosed or diagnosable as "wheezy infants*, an established patient category of major medical concern and now often identified as incipient or early-phase asthmatics. (For convenience this particular asthmatic condition is referred to as "wheezy-infant syndrome**.)<br>
Prophylactic efficacy in the treatment of asthma will be evidenced by reduced frequency or severity of symptomatic attack, e.g. of acute asthmatic or bronchoconstrictor attack, improvement in lung function or improved airways hyperreactivity. It may further be evidenced by reduced requirement for other, symptomatic therapy, Le. therapy for or intended to restrict or abort symptomatic attack when it occurs, for example anti-inflammatory (e.g. cortico-steroid) or bronchodilatory. Prophylactic benefit in asthma may in particular be apparent in subjects prone to "morning dipping". "Morning dipping" is a recognised asthmatic syndrome, common to a substantial percentage of asthmatics and characterised by asthma attack, e.g. between the hours of about 4 to 6 am, i.e. at a time normally substantially distant form any previously administered symptomatic asthma therapy.<br>
Other inflammatory or obstructive airways diseases and conditions to which the present invention is applicable include acute lung injury (ALI), acute/adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), chronic obstructive pulmonary, airways or lung disease (COPD, CO AD or COLD), including chronic bronchitis or dyspnea associated therewith, emphysema, as well as exacerbation of airways hypenreactivity consequent to other drug therapy, in particular other inhaled drug therapy. The invention is also applicable to the treatment of bronchitis of whatever type or genesis including, e.g., acute, arachidic, catarrhal, croupus, chronic or phthinoid bronchitis. Further inflammatory or obstructive airways diseases to which the present invention is applicable include pneumoconiosis (an inflammatory, commonly occupational, disease of the lungs, frequently accompanied by airways obstruction, whether chronic or acute, and occasioned by repeated inhalation of dusts) of whatever type or genesis, including, for example, aluminosis, anthracosis, asbestosis, chalicosis, ptilosis, siderosis, silicosis, tabacosis and byssinosis.<br><br>
