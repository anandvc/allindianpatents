				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a mechanical differential so as to make vehicle operation efficient in different operating conditions. More particularly, the present invention relates to a non-slipping/ skidding automatic differential lock. BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART REFERENCES<br>
It is known art, an axle (5) with a wheel (7) affixed to each end may be driven by a power source to propel a vehicle in a substanually straight line. However, when making either a left or right turn, the wheel (7) on the outer end of the axle (5) travels a greater distance than the wheel (7) on the inner end of the axle (5), causing the outer wheel to rotate faster than the inner wheel as shown in figure 3. This generally leads to twisting of the axle (5), and often results in wheel hop and/or axle breakage. Differentials having a single input member, which drive two output members in a manner that permit the speeds of each of the output members to differ have been known. Differentials emerged from the need to have both output wheels (7) of a driven axle (5) to rotate at different speeds. Typical current day differentials still remain quite similar to the first known successful differential, invented in 1827 by Onesiphore Pecqueur, a Frenchman. Today's differentials have an propeller shaft (1) as input that meshes with a crown gear/ wheel (2), as in the earlier differential by Pecqueur. The crown gear/ wheel (2) drives a housing/ casing (4) that carries bevel toothed pinions/ gears (3), which mesh with left and right side axle (5) that power the left and right wheels (7), respectively conventional available mechanical differential as shown in figure l.This conventional art distributes power from propeller shaft (1) to both wheels (7), through a set of bevel toothed pinions/ gears (3), in accordance with the operating mode. The conventional differential operates in following three different operating modes.<br>
1.	When vehicle (6) is moving on a straight road, both wheels (7) rotate at the same speed, causing the pinions/ gears (3) to remain stationary with respect to each other in the rotating housing/ casing (4), the conventional mechanical differential distribute power equally to both axles (5) and in turn wheels (7) as shown in figure 2. Reason for equal or approximately equal distribution of torque is the same number of rpm traveled by both wheels (7).<br>
2.	While vehicle (6) is negotiating a turn, the pinions/ gears (3) allow the axles (5) &amp; wheels (7) to rotate at different speeds, by rotating at their respective axes in the rotatable housing/ casing (4). Outer wheel (7) has to travel more number of turns as<br>
compared to inner wheel (7) as shown in figure 1(A) and 3. The conventional art<br>
differential distributes power unequally to both wheels (7), despite being outer wheel<br>
with higher rpm.<br>
3.   When turning or while going straight, conventional mechanical differential perform<br>
well till the road is not slippery. Consequendy, if one of the driven wheel (7) rotates<br>
on ice or mud, the wheel on the ice or mud spins, while torque to the wheel (7) not<br>
on the ice or mud is reduced. And the slipping rotational speed achieved will be in<br>
inverse proportion to the bearing friction and traction from ground. This condition<br>
increases   the  risk  of a  motor vehicle  having  such  a   differential  of becoming<br>
immobilized on substantially slippery. In extreme condition the wheel will dig a<br>
trench and vehicle will be trapped<br>
Now the conventional differential is explained in construction. It is also described that how<br>
it fails in certain conditions. It is explained with reference to figure 1(A) and 4. The propeller<br>
shaft (1) transmits power from engine to crown gear/ wheel (2). Crown gear/ wheel (2) is<br>
attached to whole differential assembly with housing/ casing (4) and driving pin (14). Then<br>
the power is transmitted as torque to axle (5) shafts and wheels (7) with help of pair of bevel<br>
pinions/ gears (3). This arrangement allows the vehicle to go on straight roads or curves.<br>
•	While vehicle(6) is moving on a straight road, both wheels(7) rotate at the same speed, causing the pinions/ gears (3) to remain stationary with respect to each other in the rotating housing/ casing, the conventional mechanical differential distribute power equally to both wheels as shown in figure2. Reason for equal or approximately equal distribution of torque is the same number of rpm of both wheels i.e. N1=N2. Torque from the propeller shaft(l) is split into two substantially equal components, which are distributed substantially equally to the left and right wheels(7) surfaces. In this case, the bevel pinions/ gears (3) only revolve around the axis A as shown in figure 4.<br>
•	While vehicle(6) is negotiating a turn, the pinions/ gears (3) allow the wheels(7) to rotate at different speeds, by rotating at their respective axes in the rotatable housing/ casing(4). Outer wheel(7) has to travel more number of turns as compared to inner wheel(7). The conventional art differential distributes power unequally to both \vheels(7), outer wheel with higher r.p.m. as shown in figure 2 with Nl&gt;/
pinions/ gears (3) not only revolve around the axis A but also rotate around the axis B as shown in figure 5.<br>
While turning or while going straight, conventional mechanical differential perform<br>
well till the road is not slippery. Consequently, if one of the driven wheels(7) rotates<br>
on ice or mud, the wheel(7) on the ice or mud spins, while torque to the wheel(7) not<br>
on the ice or mud is reduced. And the slipping rotational speed achieved will be in<br>
inverse proportion to the bearing friction and traction from ground ieN1&gt;&gt;&gt;/
N2 as shown in figure 1(A), 2 and 5. This condition increases the risk of a motor<br>
vehicle having such a differential of becoming immobilized on substantially slippery.<br>
In extreme condition the wheel will dig a trench and vehicle will be trapped<br>
Considering above cases, when motor vehicle travels in a curvilinear direction, such as when<br>
the vehicle turns left or right, or travels in a direction other than a straight line e.g. on dry<br>
pavement, a relatively small speed difference occurs between the left and right wheels.<br>
However, when the vehicle travels on ice, snow, or through mud, the differential speed<br>
between the left and right wheels increases substantially beyond the relatively small speed<br>
difference which occurs between the wheels on dry pavement. In this instance "differential<br>
locking" is desirable otherwise the vehicle may become immobilized. On the other hand,<br>
differential locking is not desirable in normal driving situations since locking the differential<br>
adversely affect directional control of the vehicle and accelerates tyre wear.<br>
Following known conventional arts for above deficiency of differential are available but each<br>
has its own limitation which still leaves the differential handicapped for entire operations.<br>
Four wheel drives: A manual transmission for a four-wheel drive vehicle transmits power to<br>
a front drive shaft for driving front wheels and to a rear drive shaft for driving rear wheels<br>
through a propeller shaft. A plurality of shift gear trains are formed by dnve gears mounted<br>
on an input shaft, driven gears meshing with the drive gears and mounted on an output shaft<br>
arranged  below  the input  shaft  and  clutches.  The  output  shaft is  hollowed inside  to<br>
incorporate  the   front  drive  shaft  therein.  An intermediate  shaft is  rotatablv,  coaxially<br>
disposed with the input shaft and is driven by the output shaft through a connection gear<br>
tram. The intermediate shaft is coaxially connected with a transfer unit from which power is<br>
distributed to the front drive shaft through another connection gear train and at the same<br>
time to the rear drive shaft. In thus layouted transmission, a large thrust load is applied to<br>
bearings for supporting the output shaft. As a result, not only the beanngs are needed to be<br>
up-sized, a large power loss generates in the bearings due to the large thrust load applied thereto. Hence, this type of the manual transmission has a difficulty in enhancing an efficiency of power transmission. On the other hand, lubrication oil is accommodated in the transmission case in order to lubricate meshing surfaces of the gears and sliding surfaces of the shafts. When a vehicle travels, the lubrication oil is splashed by rotating gears and is supplied to required parts of the transmission. In case where the power distribution apparatus is coaxially disposed with the output shaft as described above, the power transmission apparatus is positioned at the lower part of the transmission. Hence, since the lubrication oil is agitated, while a large part of the power distribution apparatus is dipped in under the static oil level, a larger agitation resistance is exerted on the output shaft. This drive has two differentials, one for each axle. It has high manufacturing and maintenance cost. In most of cases vehicle has to be stationary before vehicle is to be driven in 4WD.In many vehicles it is to be used at slow speed and at soft or loose ground. Some manufacturer provides auto engage also but at higher costs. This solution to afore said problem of differential differs totally form the above said invention, it being incorporating set of two/three differentials.<br>
Differential lock: It is common in heavy vehicles. It is very cheap but is to be engaged after vehicle is stationary. It can not be used on hard road as it will break the differential.. It is not a proactive measure and sometimes it is too late for a trapped vehicle.<br>
As disclosed in US Patent No. 6780137 (Langenfield) A differential lock mechanism for use in a vehicle and having a cam mechanism that may be actuated by the vehicle user. As disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6038506 (Diekhans) For automatically controlling a differential lock in drive axles of a motor vehicle, an arrangement has a lock coupling, an actuator for actuating the lock coupling, a plurality of rotary speed sensors associated with wheels of the vehicle for forming the rotary speed signal, a control unit for receiving the rotary speed signals and forming a control signal for controlling the actuator. As disclosed in US Patent No. 5601508(Kuzevanov) A locking device for a bevel gear differential having an insert mounted on its own axis which is also the axis of the planet bevel. The insert is situated between the opposing bevel gears and has teeth which engages with those of the bevel wheels and when the bevel wheels are displace relative to each other, the insert executes reciprocal motion along the axis of the pinions/ gears . Various ways of<br>
creating resistance in the motion of the insert is disclosed which limits the relative angular<br>
velocity of the bevel wheels as they rotate.<br>
As disclosed in U.S.Patent No.4943 269 (Smith) The differential lock is having a clutch<br>
mechanism surrounding the gear case at a position axially adjacent the annular gear member,<br>

member;<br>
As disclosed in U.S.  Patent No.  4715248(Gant)An improved mechanism  for delivering<br>
motive power to the wheel-tire units on a land vehicle, comprising a differential having two<br>
operating modes, namely a "locked" mode and an "unlocked" mode.<br>

hydraulically-operated differential lock operated by a solenoid valve. Energization of the<br>
solenoid valve is controlled by a circuit.<br>
As   disclosed   in   U.S.   Patent   No   4043224(Quick)A   differential   having   a   mechanical<br>
differential lock for use in a motor vehicle. The lock includes a plurality of pins carried on a<br>
clutch collar for sliding through openings in the differential housing to selectively engage<br>
peripheral grooves on one of the side gears of the differential to lock the differential for<br>
synchronous rotation of the side gears of the differential<br>
As disclosed in U.S. Patent No 5125 876(Hirota)To realize a small-sized differential gear<br>
provided  with   both   differential  limiting  and  locking   functions   simultaneously  without<br>
markedly modifying the conventional differential case, the differential gear comprises a<br>

thrust forces to engage said limit multiplate clutches into engagement and further locking the<br>
differential   function;   and   actuator   for   actuating   the   lock   clutch   from   outside   of the<br>
differential case.<br>
All of the above said patents are using clutches, actuators, hydraulic oil drive, pinion with<br>
teeth in  between   the  two  bevel  gears   or   friction  mechanisms,  all   of which  differs  in<br>
construction and function from above said invention<br>
Limited slip differential:.<br>
Limited slip differentials (LSD) have been developed to overcome the above mentioned<br>
shortcomings of a conventional differential, and work on various pnnciples, but generally are<br>
all intended to limit the speed difference or "slip" between the left and right driven wheels.<br>
Such limited slip differentials generally limit the speed differentiation or "slip" between the<br>
driven wheels, so that some of the torque being delivered by the input gear is transferred<br>
from the wheel that slips to the wheel that has more traction, and, therefore, aids in moving<br>
the vehicle in the preferred direction<br>
Mechanical limited slip differentials have been disclosed. U.S. Pat. No. 4,516,443 (Hamano<br>
et al) and U.S. Pat. No. 4,939,953 (Yasui) disclose mechanical limited slip differentials, each<br>
having a set of clutches connected to a housing/ casing, which alternate with another set of<br>
clutches attached to one or two side gears. The clutches are kept in contact by a preloaded<br>
spring, through which both wheels are always contacted to some extent.<br>
Parallel-axis limited slip differentials have been disclosed. U.S. Pat. No. 5,244,440 (Ichiki et<br>
al)  discloses  a parallel-axis  differential  having a plurality of pinions, in which  friction<br>
produced by meshing and rubbing of the pinions provides slip limitation. U.S. Pat. No.<br>
5,302,159 (Dye et al) discloses a parallel-axis differential in which friction produced by end<br>
thrust of pinions and side gears to a housing/ casing, resulting from specific helical tooth<br>
angles, provides slip limitation.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 3,292,456 (Saari) and U.S. Pat. No. 3,738,192 (Belansky), and European Patent<br>
No.    130806A2   (Quaife)    disclose   parallel-axis   differentials    having   pinions   that   are<br>
continuously meshed in a circumferential manner, which provide slip limitation, resulting<br>
from an increase in frictional surfaces at tooth meshing points and between pinions and<br>
housing/ casing.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 3,251,244 (Nickell), U.S.  Pat. No. 4,272,993 (Kopich), and U.S. Pat. No.<br>
5,083,987 (Korner et al) disclose parallel-axis differentials having pinions in pairs, in which<br>
meshing teeth also function as pumps, and the resistance to pumping action provides slip<br>
limitation.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 4,630,505 (Williamson) also discloses a parallel-axis differential, which also<br>
functions as a pump, in which the resistance to pumping action provides slip limitation, the<br>
side     gears      being     internally      toothed,     instead     of     having     external      toothing.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,232,410 (Yanai) and U.S. Pat. No. 5,162,024 (Toshiba) disclose limited slip differentials that use pumping resistance for slip limitation. Piston pumps are used instead of gear pumps, as seen in the parallel-axis differentials described above..<br>
Vehicle drive train couplings using the resistance to pumping action have been disclosed. U.S. Pat. No. 3,869,013 (Pagdin et al) and U.S. Pat. No. 5,456,642 (Frost) disclose vehicle drive train couplings, using resistance to pumping action of gear pumps to transmit torque across the couplings.<br>
Limited slip differentials having viscous couplings have been disclosed. U.S. Pat. No. 4,869,129 (Hazebrook) and U.S. Pat. No. 5,162,023 (Kwoka) disclose viscous couplings attached to a housing/ casing and an output member. The coupling units have stacks of alternating discs immersed in a viscous fluid medium. The presence of speed difference between left and right wheel causes the alternating discs to rotate at different speeds, shearing along the fluid medium between the stacks of the alternating discs. U.S. Pat. No. 4,012,968 (Kelbel) and U.S. Pat. No. 5,611,746 (Shaffer) disclose limited slip differentials that limit the slip above a predetermined differential speed. The devices have clutches that are engaged by fluid pressure.<br>
However, most of these limited slip differentials do not limit the speed difference between the driven wheels adequately at a substantially large speed differential or slip between the driven wheels. Limited slip differentials have valves, clutches, pistons or other special components that add to the complexity and cost of production. It has high cost due to frequent repair of clutch. It makes an axle assembly complicated. In extreme cases, more force is applied to the wheel which has lost its grip, whole purpose being defeated Different limited slip differentials have heretofore been known. However, none of the limited slip differentials adequately satisfies these aforementioned needs and are using clutches which makes them different in construction and function as compared to above said invention. For the foregoing reasons, there is a need for a self locking/ nonskidding differential which limits the speed differentiation between the driven wheels and which increases torque to the non-slipping wheel, as the rotational speed difference between the slipping wheel and the non-slipping wheel increases. The rate of increase of the torque to the non-slipping wheel should increase, as the speed difference between the slipping wheel and the non-slipping wheel increases. Such self locking/nonslipping differentials should be inexpensive, durable, long lasting, sturdy, easy to manufacture and install, either as an original equipment item or<br>
as a retrofit, be capable of having a substantially similar form factor and size as original<br>
equipment items, be easy to maintain, and require a minimum of maintenance. The self<br>
locking/nonslipping differential should also be compatible with anti-lock braking systems,<br>
two, four, and multiple drive vehicles, and be useable in vehicle and other applications.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The main object of present invention is to provide a non-slipping/ skidding automatic<br>
differential lock.<br>
The object of this invention is to make a device for obviating the above said defects,<br>
drawbacks simultaneously lowering the manufacturing cost, maintenance cost and keeping<br>

and limited slip differential.<br>

The invention consists of two bevel pinions/ gears (8), two elements(10) and a spring, housing/ casing(12).<br>
The above said bevel pinions/ gears (8) has two inverted T shaped recesses(9) ,180° apart on its base as shown in figure 6 by third angle projection. These recesses(9) are made in such a way that they accommodate the element(10) and spring. The above said element(lO) is as shown in figure8 by third angle projection. Its triangular shape is responsible for the proactive nature of the invention The above said bevel pinions/ gears (8) and element (10) are arranged with help of spring as shown in figure 1(B) and 8 . The above said housing/ casing(4) has two protrusions(13) as shown in figure 9.The above said housing/ casing is shown in figure 9 at two sections DD' and CC'. The triangular shape of the above said new housing protrusion (13) is also responsible for its proactive nature. The whole assembly of the present invention is shown as complete assembly in figure 10. The bevel pinions/ gears (8) is mounted on driving pin(14) and the driving pin(14) is fitted in the housing/ casing(4) as is fitted in the conventional differential.<br>
Now the working of differential of the present invention is explained in detail under various conditions. It is also described that how it does not fails in certain conditions. According to this invention, vehicle is equipped with anti-skidding/ slipping and self locking automatic mechanism, the said mechanism being housed inside the differential assembly itself. Above said mechanism is activated just before the vehicle start skidding or digging into a trench. Once vehicle is out of danger of slipping, above-mentioned mechanism is deactivated. Above said mechanism remains deactivated during normal maneuvering of vehicle. The propeller shaft(l) transmits power from engine to crown gear/ wheel(2). Crown gear/ \vheel(2) is attached to set of bevel gears/ pinions with housing/ casing(4)and driving pm(14). Then the power is transmitted as torque to axle shafts(5) and wheels(7) with help of bevel pinions/ gears (8).<br>
Therefore, the present invention provides a non slipping/skidding automatic differential providing positive locking or positive drive in differential, said differential comprising a housing (12) having protrusions (13) being driven by crown gear/ wheel; a pair of counter-positioned bevel gears (8) having elements (10) and disposed within said housing (12); and said elements (10) being inserted and placed within horizontal slots (9) of the bevel gear using a spring (11) such that just before slipping/ skidding said elements and protrusion interacts with each other.<br>
In another embodiment of present invention, the protrusions and elements is triangular shape, which is responsible for proactive nature of the differential.<br>
In another embodiment of present invention, the horizontal slots are T shaped recesses. In another embodiment of present invention, the bevel gear is mounted on a driving pin (14), said driving pin is fitted in the said housing/ casing.<br>
In another embodiment of present invention, the housing and the driving pin are attached to the crown gear/ wheel (2).<br>
In another embodiment of present invention, the crown gear/ wheel (2) is attached to a propeller shaft (1), said propeller shaft transmitting power from engine to the crown gear/ wheel (2).<br>
In another embodiment of present invention, the bevel gears (8) are meshed with a left and right side axle (5) powering the left and right wheels (7) respectively.<br>
In another embodiment of present invention, while negotiating a curve the element is pushed outward under the action of centrifugal force but its travel is restricted by the spring. In another embodiment of present invention, just before skidding/ slipping, the element is pushed outward under the action of centrifugal force and interacts with the protrusion.<br>
• While going on straight roads both left and right wheels get equal traction/ resistance so both rotate at same r.p.m : In this case ,above said bevel gear(8) will not rotate about dnving pin(14) i.e. axis B but revolve around axis A in order to distribute the torque to axles(5) as shown in figure 1(B) and 10. As a result of which no centrifugal force acts on element (10) and it will be held in its posiuon as shown in figures 10,11,12. So, differential will act satisfactorily while vehicle is moving on a straight road. In this condition, there is no interaction between protrusion and element.<br>
•	While negotiating a curve, traction/ resistance on inner wheel (7) is more than outer wheel (7) so both wheels have different rotational speeds, hence the distance traveled by them is also different as shown in figure 1(B) and 3. In this case ,above said bevel pinions/ gears (8) will rotate about driving pin(14) i.e. axis B as well as revolve around axis A in order to distribute the torque, as shown in figure 10. As a result of which centrifugal force acts on element(lO). Under the action of centrifugal force, T shaped element(lO) is pushed outwards, but its travel is restricted by a spnng. In this case rpm of bevel gear(8) is such that the element(8) is subjected to centrifugal force 
•	Now considering the above said art in condition of slip or skid when one wheel (7) loses its grip on road due to oil, grease, ice or mud. The wheel (7), which is slipping, is getting least traction/ resistance from ground. So its rpm goes on increasing with increased throtde but vehicle keeps on slipping or skidding, because wheel having grip on ground is not getting enough torque. In this case above said bevel pinions/ gears (8) rotates at very high rpm around the driving pin(14) that is around axis B. So above said element(lO) is acted upon by centrifugal force which is more in magnitude as compared to the spnng force. Due to centrifugal force greater than spring force the above said element will move to extreme radial outward position as shown in figure 16 and 17. At this position above said element (10) will mesh with above said housing protrusion (13).The design of above said protrusion(13) and above said (10) element is such that they will not disengage with minor vanation of rpm ,once interlocked, which is shown in figure 18. This locking of above said bevel pinions/ gears (8) and housing/ casing(12) will lock left and right wheels(7) and propeller shaft(l) ,which results in equal distribution of torque to both wheels(7). So the wheel(7) with better grip on road or more traction/ resistance on road also gets torque i.e. vehicle will not skid or slip. When vehicle has crossed the oily/greasy/ice patch, the relative motion between two wheels(7) is reduced hence centntugal force <spnng force acting on elements resulting in pusing the towards driving pins. hence inter locking is broken as shown figure interlocking acts advance due to element and housing casing triangular shape.></spnng>
deactivation is also delayed due to specific shape of protrusions and elements. This characteristic of the present invention gives advantage to driver as the above said invention is acnvated just before vehicle starts skidding.<br>
The mathematical analysis of above said is to determine the mass of the element of the<br>
present invention.<br>
This parameters is critical as above said element (10) has to mesh with above said housing<br>
protrusion (13) only when vehicle is skidding and not when vehicle is turning.<br>
Design parameters can be determined as follows:<br>
Referring to figure 3, consider a vehicle of width 't', with wheel radius V moving on a road<br>
with velocity 'V on a curve of radius 'R'<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
While going on straight road<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
While going on curve<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Relative angular velocity between two wheels<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
This is the relative velocity between outer and inner wheel. Or we can say that for a unit time, distance covered by outer wheel with respect to inner wheel is<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The number of turns taken bv outer wheel as compared to inner wheel is<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The above said bevel pinions/ gears (8) are in direct contact with the wheel axle(5). So they will also rotate in proportion to the relative angular velocity of the wheels(7) or the number of turns per unit time of wheel and bevel pinions/ gears (8) will be proportional. Let the gear ratio of axle(5) and bevel pinions/ gears (8) is       = g Then the number of turns taken by bevel pinions/ gears (8) is<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
And angular acceleration of the bevel pinions/ gears (8) is<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
When above said bevel pinions/ gears (8) rotate at angular acceleration αb, the above said element (10) will revolve around driving pin(14). Due to shape of the above said recess(9) above said element(10) will be subjected to only normal component of angular acceleration. The explanation to normal component is mentioned herebelow:<br>
Consider a particle moving along a curve. When the particle moves from one point to second point, the change of velocity may be obtained by drawing the vector triangle. The side of triangle representing the velocity of the particle can be resolved into two mutually perpendicular components, one in the direction of the tangent and other in the direction perpendicular to the tangent.<br>
Since the change of the velocity of the particle has two mutually perpendicular components, therefore the acceleration of a particle moving along a circular path has the following two components:<br>
1.	Tangential component of acceleration is the acceleration of particle at any instant<br>
moving along circular path, in a direction tangential to that instant.<br>
2.	Normal component of the acceleration is the acceleration of the particle at any<br>
instant and directed in perpendicular direction to the tangent. This acceleration   is<br>
also called radial acceleration.<br>
Therefore, said element (10) will be subjected to only normal component of angular acceleration.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
R, t, g, r being constant due to fixed construction and operating parameters of vehicle, the above equation is reduced to<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The above said element(lO) is subjected to two kinds of forces, first is the force due to normal component of angular acceleration and second is the force due to spring. So forming the force equation for the above said element<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
In order to engage the above said element (10) and the above said protrusion (13) of the housing/ casing(12) in such a way that they are interlocked only during slipping and not during turning, at first we find position of equilibrium<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
Considering that above said element(10) is engaged at outer periphery of bevel pinions/ gears (8), factor 'q' is also fixed, outer periphery being the position at which maximum of acceleration acts on the element. And fixing the distance of above said protrusion(13) i.e. = x from driving pin, the above equation reduces to<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
Depending upon the availability of spring k is also fixed<br>
So mass of the above said element (10) and its dimensions can also be calculated.<br>
