DISULFIDE DYES, COMPOSITION COMPRISING THEM AND METHOD OF DYEING HAIR<br>
SulfidG dves<br>
The present invention relates to novel sulfide dyes, compositions thereof, to processes for their preparation and to their use for the dyeing of organic materials, such as keratin fibers, wool, leather, silk, cellulose or polyamides, especially keratin-containing fibers, cotton or nylon, and preferably hair, more preferably human hair.<br>
It is known, for example, from WO 95/01772 that cationic dyes can be used to dye organic material, for example keratin, silk, cellulose or cellulose derivatives, and also synthetic fibers, for example polyamides. Cationic dyes exhibit very brilliant shades. A disadvantage is their unsatisfactory fastness to washing.<br>
R. S. Asquith, P. Carthew and T. T. Francis describe in JSDC from May 1973, pages 168-172 that ortho-azo disulfide dyes do not lead to covalent bonding with keartin fiber of wool, and that para-azo disulfide dyes underwent only at high concentration some covalent bindings with wool.<br>
The actual technical problem of the present invention was to provide dyes that are distinguished by deep dying having good fastness properties with respect to washing, light, shampooing and rubbing.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a method of dyeing keratin-containing fibers, comprising treating the fiber with at least one sulfide dye of formula<br><br>
R1 and R2 each independently from each other are a residue of an organic dye;<br>
Y1 and Y2 each independently from each other are unsubstituted or substituted, straight-chain or branched, interrupted or uninterrupted -C1-C4oalkylene-; -C5-C10cycloalkylene-; C5-C10arylene; or-C6-C10arylene-C1-C10alkylene)-;<br>

if n is 1,<br>

with the proviso that the method does not comprise treating the fiber with an enzyme of the<br>
type of a protein disuifidisomerase (EC 5.3.4.1).<br>
Preferably Y1 and Y2 are unsubstituted or substituted straight-chain or branched interrupted or uninterrupted af-C5-C10cycloalkylene- or -C1-C10alkylene.<br>
