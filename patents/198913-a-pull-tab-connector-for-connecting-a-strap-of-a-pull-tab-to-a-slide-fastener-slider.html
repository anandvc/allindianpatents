DETAILED DESCRIPTION QF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The principle of the present invention is particularly-useful when applied to a pull-tab connector for a slide fastener slider, various preferred embodiments of which will now be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
The pull-tab connector of the present invention basically comprises, as shown in FIG. 1, a generally U-shaped bracket 1, and a connecting ring 7 projecting from an outer surface of a central frame 5 of the U-shaped bracket 1 and adapted to be attached to a slider body S. Opposite side frames 6 of the U-shaped bracket 1 have a pair of horizontal rectangular slots<br>
8	at their respective centers and a pair of circular pivot holes<br>
9	near at their respective free ends.<br>
A strap-turning bar 2 in the form of a cylindrical rod has at opposite ends a pair of pivots 10 to be received in the respective slots 8 of the opposite side frames 6 and is thereby slidably and rotatably supported by the opposite side frames 6 . Likewise a strap-insertion bar 3 of a square-cross-section has at opposite ends a pair of pivots 12 to be received in the respective pivot holes 9 of the opposite side frames 6 and is thereby rotatably supported by the opposite side frames 6 . The strap-insertion bar 3 has a rectangular strap-insertion<br><br>
through-hole 11 extending over the majority of its entire length so that the strap 4 may be inserted through the strap-insertion through-hole 11 as described later.<br>
The pull-tab connector, with the strap-turning and strap-insertion bars 2, 3 being supported between the opposite side frames 6 of the U-shaped bracket, is manufactured simultaneously by die-casting of metal such as aluminum alloy or zinc alloy. Alternatively, the pull-tab connector may be molded by injection molding using thermoplastic synthetic resin, such as polyamide, polyacetal, polypropylene or polybutylene-telephthalate, instead of metal.<br>
The steps in which the strap 4 in the form of a flat strip is threaded through the U-shaped bracket 1 will now be described with reference to FIGS,. 3A through 3D. Firstly a leading end of the flat strap 4 is inserted through the through-hole 11 of the strap-insertion bar 3 and is then inserted through the space between the strap-turning bar 2 and the central frame 5 of the U-shaped frame 1 from the upper side of the strap-turning bar 2 as shown in FIG. 3B. At that time, the strap-insertion bar 3 is pivotally moved or tilted toward the strap-turning bar 2 as shown in FIG. 3B. Then the leading end of the strap 4 is inserted through the through-hole 11 of the strap-insertion bar 3 after turning around the strap-turning bar 2 as shown in FIG. 3C. Finally, the leading end of the strap 4 is drawn outwardly from the strap-insertion bar<br><br>
3 until it comes into vertical alignment with its trailing end, whereupon the two aligned ends of the strap 4 are drawn further to pull the strap-turning bar 2 toward the strap-insertion bar 3 by the strap loop, thus tightening the strap 4. In the meantime, the connector ring 7 is attached to the slider body S. Thus the pull tab of FIG. 2 has been completed.<br>
FIG. 4 shows another pull-tab connector according to a second embodiment. This embodiment is identical with the first embodiment of FIG. 1 except that a strap-turning bar 2 is fixed at opposite ends as shown in FIG. 3D to opposite side frames 6 of a modified U-shaped bracket 1 of the connector, which is devoid of a longitudinal slot in each of the side frame 6 . A strap- insertion bar 3 has at opposite ends a pair of pivot's 12 which are rotatably received ii;i the respective pivot holes 9 of the opposite side frames 6. Also the strap-insertion bar 3 has a rectangular strap-insertion through-hole 11 extending over the majority of its entire length so that the strap 4 may be inserted through the strap-insertion through-hole 11. A connecting ring 7 projects from an outer surface of a central frame 5 of the U-shaped bracket 1 for being attached to the slider body S. The steps of threading the strap 4 through the U-shaped bracket 1 are substantially similar to that of the first embodiment, which are discussed in connection with FIGS. 3A through 3D.<br>
FIG. 5 shows still another pull-tab connector according<br><br>
to a third embodiment. This embodiment is identical with the first embodiment of FIG. 1 except that both of the strap-turning bar 2 and the strap-insertion bar 3 are fixed at opposite ends to opposite side frames 6 of a modified U-shaped bracket 1 of the connector, which is devoid of a slot and the pivot hole in either side frame 6. Likewise the first embodiment, the strap-insertion bar 3 has a rectangular strap-insertion through-hole 11 extending over the majority of its entire length so that the strap 4 may be inserted through the strap-insertion through-hole 11. A connecting ring 7 projects from an outer surface of a central frame 5 of the U-shaped bracket 1 for being attached to the slider body S. The steps of threading the strap 4 through the U-shaped bracket 1 are substantially similar to tlat of the first embodiment, which are discussed in connection with FIGS. 3A through 3D. FIG. 6 shows still another pull-tab connector according to a fourth embodiment, which is suitable for use with a round strap. This embodiment is differentiated from the first embodiment of FIG. 1 in that a modified U-shaped bracket 1 has a pair of parallel bearing lugs 14 projecting from an outer surface of a central frame 5 of the U-shaped bracket 1. A connecting ring 7 to be attached to the slider body S is pivotally supported on the bearing lugs 14 by a pair of pivots 16 projecting from opposite ends of a ring neck 15 of the ring 7. The pivots 16 are rotatably received in respective pivot<br><br>
holes 13 of the bearing lugs 14.<br>
Regarding the remaining structure of the pull-tab connector of this embodiment is identical with the first embodiment of FIG. 1 except for the strap-turning bar 2 and the strap-insertion bar 3. Namely, in this embodiment, the strap-turning bar 2 of a rectangular cross section has a pair of laterally spaced small-width rectangular though-holes 17 through which the round strap 4 is to be inserted. On the other hand, the strap-insertion bar 3 has a modified rectangular strap-insertion through-hole 11, which is slightly larger in size than the through-holes 17 of the strap-turning bar 2, so that the round strap 4 may be inserted through the strap-insertion through-hole 11. Also the strap-insertion through-hole 11 is smaller in width than that of the first embodiment and is located at a position toward the center as compared to the through-holes 17 of the strap-turning bar 2 so that the inserted round strap 4 is avoided from being laterally displaced or spread apart. Alternatively, either the through-holes 17 of the strap-turning bar 2 or the strap-insertion through-hole 11 may be circular or oval.<br>
The steps in which the round strap 4 is threaded through the U-shaped bracket 1 of this embodiment will now be described with reference to FIG. 7. Firstly a leading end of the round strap 4 is inserted through the strap-insertion through-hole 11 of the strap-insertion bar 3 and through one of the two<br><br>
through-holes 17 of the strap-insertion bar 3 as the strap-turning bar 2 and the strap-insertion bar 3 are angularly moved. Then the leading end of the round strap 4 is inserted through the other through-hole 17 of the strap-turning bar 2, turning around the inter-hole portion of the strap-turning bar 2, and is inserted again through the through-hole 11 of the strap-insertion bar 3. Finally, the leading end of the round strap 4 is drawn outwardly from the strap-insertion bar 3 until it comes into lateral alignment with its trailing end, whereupon the aligned opposite ends of the round strap 4 are pulled away from the pull-tab connector to complete the assembling of the pull tab as shown in FIG. 7.<br>
FIG. 8 shows a clamp member 20 as a fastener for clamping the opposite ends of the strap 4 tlireaded through the U-shaped bracket 1 as shown in FIG. 9. The clamp member 20 is composed of a base 21 and a holder plate 22 for clamping the opposite ends of the strap 4 between them. The holder plate 22 has a pair of resilient angled legs 25 while the base 21 has a pair of catch holes 24 engageable with the angled legs 25 in a snap action when the holder plate 22 and the base 21 are pressed toward each other to assume a closed posture as shown in FIG. 9. Further, the base 21 has a recess 23 for receiving the opposite ends of the strap 4 and a plurality of spikes 26 on a bottom of the recess 23 for biting into the opposite ends of the strap 4 when the strap ends are clamped between the base<br><br>
21	and the holder plate 22.<br>
FIG. 10 is a perspective view similar to FIG. 9, but showing a modified clamp member 20. In this modified clamp member 20, the contact surfaces of the base 21 and the holder plate 22 are identical, and the base 21 and/or the holder plate<br>
22	have/has on its outer surface a plurality of lines of lateral<br>
grooves so that the pull tab can be gripped by fingers without<br>
skidding.<br>
