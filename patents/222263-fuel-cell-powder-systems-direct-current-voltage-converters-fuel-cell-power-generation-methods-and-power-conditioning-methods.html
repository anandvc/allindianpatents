				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The invention in general relates to electronic energy meters. More specifically the present invention relates to prepayment electronic energy meters and methods for operating the same.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Recovery of charges from the consumers of electricity is a major challenge that the electricity suppliers face, especially in the third world countries. In many countries the commercial arrangement of electricity supply is based on the supplier of the electricity selling electrical energy to consumers and charging them subsequent to the sale on the basis of the amount of electricity consumed. There exists a huge disproportion between the billed consumption and the actual payment in lieu thereof received by the electricity suppliers. This has eventually resulted in problems in revenue collection and huge arrears of electricity bills. In order to address this issue, there has been research and development in the field of electrical energy meters. However, the focus of such research has been thus far, to configure electric energy meters to tap the amount of energy flow with utmbst precision.<br>
In order to address the problems faced by rampant power theft prevalent in developing and the less developed countries, it is important to explore the possibility of bringing in a paradigm shift in the concept of selling electricity. This conceptual change could address the possibility of quantifying electrical energy at the time of purchase thereof by a consumer using an electronic energy meter..<br>
Related Art<br>
Electronic energy meters are known and are commercially used. Also known in the art are prepayment electronic energy meters. United States Patent No.<br>
6,529,883 titled "Prepayment Energy Metering System with Two-Way Smart Card Communications" to Yee et al. discloses an energy metering system and a provision for two way secure communication of data through the use of a smart card, which conveys data from the utility service provider to the customers terminal and also conveys information from the customers terminal back to the utility.<br>
United States Patent No. 4,731,575 titled "Prepayment Metering System Using Encoded Purchase Card" to Joseph W. Sloan discloses a prepayment utility metering apparatus, which uses encoded purchase cards to transfer purchase information from the utility billing office to the consumer's premises.<br>
United States Patent No. 3,778,637 titled "Apparatus for Supplying a Predetermined Quantity of Electric Power" discloses the use of a prepayment chip, which is inserted into a receptacle in order to enable a measured quantity of electricity to be supplied to the user, hi advance of the discontinuation of service, which occurs when the measured amount of power is used up, an alarm system is activated. A fuse in each chip is melted for the purpose of precluding reuse of the chip. It has also been proposed that a utility meter unit be supplied with a stack of bills. At the end of each month, the meter unit would print and dispense a bill for mailing by the customer to the utility company along with a check for the indicated amount.<br>
United States Patent No. 4,240,030 titled 'Intelligent Electric Utility Meter' to Batemann et al. discloses an electric utility meter equipped with special circuitry and components, which work in conjunction with an inserted card having an encodable medium included in it to regulate the supply of electricity to the home or other structure to which electricity is to be provided. The unit operates in one of two modes, as determined by an internal switch. In the prepayment mode, the card has encoded upon it a credit for a predetermined amount of electricity. When the card is inserted, the unit senses and adds this credit to the present allocation of<br>
electricity, which has been determined by prior cards. As the card is removed, the encoding upon it is erased by the unit so as to prevent its reuse. Power is automatically shut off when the prepaid amount of electricity runs out. In the postpayment mode, when a special postpayment type encodable card is inserted into the unit, the amount of electricity utilized during the current payment period is-encoded on the card. The card is then mailed to the utility company either with a check or as the basis of a future billing.<br>
Systems of the type described above have been developed to address the above-mentioned issues. However, the present invention differs from the known prior art configurations disclosed above.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
It is the principal aspect of the present invention to configure a prepayment electronic energy meter having a main switch compartment configured to receive power from the supply mains for the functioning of the system, an energy controller configured to receive the communication card and execute the predetermined instructions in the communication card, an electronic energy meter configured to receive and measure the quantity of energy received by the system, and a communication card configured to possess specific predetermined instructions encrypted in it. The prepayment electronic energy meter is configured to receive a predetermined quantity of energy units upon receiving instructions from the communication card.<br>
It is also an aspect of the present invention to configure a main switch compartment having an external power supply indicator configured to indicate the<br>
supply of power to the consumers installation, an auxiliary backup battery with<br>
recharging module configured to provide power in the event of any disruption of power to the energy controller, main switch configured to draw the power from the main supply and a solenoid switch configured for switching the main switch 'ON'<br>
or 'OFF'. The main switch compartment is configured to receive power from the supply mains for the functioning of the system.<br>
It is also an aspect of the present invention to configure an energy controller having plurality of display lamps indicating the availability of power to the energy controller and the commencement of operation by the energy controller, ..a-microprocessor controller configured to operationally control the working of the prepayment electronic energy meter, a metering unit with a plurality of display windows configured to display the availability of energy units and the units th'at have been consumed at the installation, a memory configured to record all the activities performed by the energy controller, a LED module configured to display all activities in a sequential log, a service port configured to retrieve the information saved in the memory, a communication card housing with a display lamp configured to receive the communication card and indicate the recognition of the communication card by the energy controller, a communication interface configured to control the interaction and establishment of the contact between the communication card, the communication card housing and the microprocessor controller, a card reader/writer in conjunction with the encryption energy controller and the microprocessor energy controller, which encrypts the date/and time of the commencement of operation of the energy controller on the communication card, a magnetic circuit control configured to control the operation of the main switch, a relay switch configured to control the operation of the solenoid switch and in turn the main switch for drawing the power from the supply mains. The energy controller is configured to receive the communication card and execute the predetermined instructions in the communication card.<br>
It is also an aspect of the present invention to provide for a microprocessorbased communication card with the encrypted instructions for controlling the operations of the electronic energy meter<br>
It is further an aspect of the present invention to provide for a predetermined quantity of energy units to the consumer's location. The communication card, according to the encrypted instructions in it, would let the assigned quantum of energy to flow from the supply to the energy controller. The energy controller is also operated with the help of a microprocessor instructing the energy controller to accept the commands from the communication card.<br>
In another aspect of the invention the card is encrypted with special recognition code which the electronic energy controller can recognize and perform accordingly. The communication card also carries encrypted data energy purchased from supplier.<br>
In yet another aspect of the present invention, the electronic energy controller is enabled with a housing to receive the card in it.

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiment<br>
Fig 1 illustrates the block diagram of the prepayment electronic energy meter (100). The system comprises of a main switch compartment (110) in communication with the energy controller (120), which is operationally connected with the communication card (140). The energy controller (120) further is also in communication with an electronic energy meter (130) installed at the consumer's location. The communication card (140) in conjunction with the energy controller (120) controls the operation and functioning of the other components embodying the prepayment electronic energy meter (100).<br>
Fig 2 illustrates a schematic block diagram of the interaction of the various components of the prepayment electronic energy meter (100). The main switch compartment (110) has an external power supply indicator (150) to indicate the availability of supply, an auxiliary backup battery with recharging module (160) for the energy controller (120) in the event of any disruption of power to the energy controller (120), a main power switch (170) to draw the power in from the supply mains and a solenoid switch (180) for switching the main switch (170) 'ON'/OFF'.<br>
The energy controller (120) has display lamps (190) to indicate the supply in the energy controller (120) and display lamp (200) indicating the operation of-the<br>
energy controller. A microprocessor-based energy controller (210) operationally controlling the working of the prepayment electronic energy meter (100). A metering unit (220) having display window (230) displays the units of energy consumed and the display window (240) displays the units of energy yet to be used by the consumer. A memory (250) to record all the activities performed by the energy controller (120) with the date and time of the operation to be transferred to the LED module (260), which is operationally connected to the microprocessor-based energy controller (210) and the details logged in the memory can be extracted through the service port (270). A spring type communication card housing (280) to receive the communication card (140) and has a contact pad to establish electrical contact with the communication card (140). A communication interface (290) controls the interaction and establishment of the contact between the communication card (140), the communication card housing (280) and the microprocessor-based energy controller (210). The communication card housing (280) further has a display lamp (300). As soon as the communication is established between the communication card (140), energy controller (120) and the communication card housing (280), the display lamp (300) glows. A card reader/ writer (310) in conjunction with the encryption energy controller (320) and the microprocessor-based energy controller (210) encrypts the date and time of the commencement of operation of the energy controller (120) on the communication card (140). A magnetic circuit control (330) controls the operation of the main switch (170). The energy controller (120) is operationally connected to the electronic energy meter (130). The communication card (140) is inserted inside the communication card housing (280) in the energy controller (120). The electrical pad at the underside of the communication card (140) establishes contact with the energy controller 120 through a two-way communication interface (290). The interaction establishes recognition of identity between communication card (140) and energy controller (120). A display lamp (300) lights up at communication card housing (280) signifying the establishment. If not, both the communication card (140) and the energy controller (120) remain inert. The secret identity code of the energy controller (120) is encrypted by the<br>
supplier at the time of it's installation at consumer's installation to facilitate prepayment scheme, having matched with the encrypted code on the communication card (140), command is issued to energy controller (120) to energize the relay switch (340) for the solenoid switch (180) to switch ON the main switch (170) to draw power in. A display lamp (190) in the energy controller (120) will glow signifying that supply is available inside energy controller (120). Communication card (140) commands commencement of operation to allow the purchased units into the electronic energy meter (130) through to consumer's installation. The energy controller (120) in conjunction with the card reader/writer (310) and the encryption energy controller (320) encrypts the date and time of commencement of operation on the communication card (140). The. communication card (140) transfers the encrypted energy account into the display window (230) in the metering unit (220). The energy controller (120) switches 'ON' display lamp (200) designating the commencement of the operation in the energy controller (120). The electronic energy meter (130) starts recording energy flowing through it. The metering unit (220) commences to deduct energy, so passed, from the units recorded in the display window (230) earlier transferred by the communication card (140), showing the balance units yet to pass through. The display window (230) shows units actually consumed at any given time.<br>
In case of power failure, both the energy controller (120) and the communication card (140) will remain inactive till the supply failure lasts but will resume interaction from the stage last the command had been executed before interruption. The electronic energy meter (130) will cause units to pass through till such time when at a pre-set value of energy to be delivered, the energy controller (120) will cause the display lamp (190) to blink, warning the consumer that energy being supplied is nearing exhaustion. When energy being supplied is about to exhaust the display lamp (200) also starts blinking till the very end of supply. This predetermined amount as percentage of purchased units is encrypted in the communication card at the time of manufacture. This display lamp (190) continues to blink till the very end of supply of the available units. At the end of the supply<br>
units, the energy controller (120) erases recognition code on the communication card (140) to prevent it from further operation to become inert. Thereafter, the display lamp on the communication card housing (300) switches OFF, indicating, that the communication card (140) is rendered inert. The display window (240) shows zero units and the energy controller (120) in conjunction with the card reader/writer (310) and the encryption controller (320) encrypts the date and time on the communication card (140). The energy controller (120) switches the main switch (170) 'OFF' by causing the relay switch (340) to energize the solenoid switch (180) to pull the switch down to the OFF position. The communication card will be ejected out of the spring loaded-communication card housing (280) by pressing the button.<br>
Fig 3 illustrates the flow chart explaining the process flow for the operation of the prepayment electronic energy meter (100). The process starts with the insertion of the communication card (140) in the communication card housing (280) as shown in (350). If the recognition code as encrypted on the communication card matches with the identity code on the energy controller (120) shown in (360), the display lamp (300) on the communication card housing (280) is 'ON' (380), else no indication light on the communication card housing (280), shown in (370). The memory (250) then commences the Log Operation (390) and the data can be extracted through the service port (270) shown in (400). The magnetic circuit is then energized (410) and the main switch (170) in 'ON' (420) and thereafter the energy controller (120) receives supply (430). The date and time of commencement of operation is encrypted on the communication card (140) and the units are transferred to the energy controller (120) shown in (440). The display lamp (190) on the energy controller (120) is 'ON' (450). The energy controller (120) checks whether the balance units are more than 0 (460). If the units are more than 0, the electronic energy meter (130) starts receiving the units (470). If the supply is interrupted from the supply mains (480), the communication card (140) and the energy controller (120) stops further action (500). If the supply is. not interrupted, one unit is added to each unit passing through the electronic energy<br>
meter (130) and the consumed units are displayed in the display window (230) in the energy controller (120) shown in (490) and also one unit is subtracted from the balance units left and the balance units are displayed in the display window (240) of the energy controller (120). A preset percentage of units is set in the energy, controller (120) which checks the balance units available and if the balance units greater than the preset percentage of energy, the units are delivered to the energy controller (120), and the power supply continues (510) otherwise, the display lamp (190) showing the power supply on the energy controller (120) starts blinking (520). Another preset unit percentage is set in the energy controller (120), wherein when the balance units available are less than this preset units percentage (540), the display lamp (190) indicating the energy controller's operation (120) starts blinking. And when the balance units are no more available, the recognition code is defaced (560) from the communication card (140) and the main switch (170) is switched 'OFF' (570). The date and time of completion of the operation is encrypted on the communication card (140) shown in (580). The display lamp (300) on the communication card housing (280) is switched 'OFF' (590) and the card is removed (600).<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
