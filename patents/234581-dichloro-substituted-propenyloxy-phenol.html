The following are production examples for the intermediate compounds of the general formula [IV], [V] or [VI].<br>
Intermediate Production Example 1: Production of intermediate compound 1)<br><br>
A reaction vessel was charged with 25.5 g of hydroquinone monobenzyl ether, 17.9 g of benzoyl chloride, 0.50 g of tetrabutylammonium bromide and 100 ml of toluene, to which 78.6 g of 10% potassium hydroxide solution was slowly added dropwise, while stirring under ice cooling. After 24 hours, the reaction mixture was made weakly acidic by the addition of 20% hydrochloric acid, and the deposited crystals were collected by filtration. The crystals thus obtained were successively washed with 10% hydrochloric acid and water, and dried, which afforded 38 g of 4-benzyloxyphenyl benzoate (98% yield).<br>
A reaction vessel was charged with 38 g of 4-benzyloxyphenyl benzoate and 500 ml of ethanol, and the air in the vessel was replaced with nitrogen. Then, 1.0 g of 10% palladium carbon was added thereto, and the nitrogen in the vessel was replaced with hydrogen, followed by vigorous stirring at room temperature for 24 hours. The hydrogen in the vessel was replaced with nitrogen, after which the reaction mixture was filtered though celite, and the filtrate was concentrated, which afforded 24.5 g of 4-hydroxyphenyl benzoate (94% yield).<br>
A reaction vessel was charged with 24.5 g of 4-hydroxyphenyl benzoate and 500 ml of carbon tetrachloride, to which a solution of 24.8 g of t-butyl hypochlorite dissolved in 20 ml of carbon tetrachloride was slowly added dropwise, while stirring under ice cooling. After 24 hours, the reaction mixture was poured into water, followed by phase separation. The organic layer (i.e., carbon tetrachloride layer) was washed with water, dried with anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and concentrated to obtain a crude product. The crude product was subjected to silica gel chromatography, which afforded 29.5 g of 3,5-dichloro-4-hydroxyphenyl benzoate (91% yield).<br>
A reaction vessel was charged with 1.54 g of 3,5-dichloro-4-hydroxyphenyl benzoate, 0.83 g of potassium carbonate, 1.53 g of 4-fluoro-3-phenoxybenzyl bromide, and 10 ml of N,N-dimethylformamide, followed by stirring at room temperature for 5 hours.  The reaction mixture was poured into water, and extracted twice with 50 m of diethyl ether.  The combined ether layer was washed with water, dried with anhydrous<br><br>
magnesium sulfate, and concentrated to obtain a crude product. The crude product was subjected to silica gel chromatography, which afforded 2.32 g of 3,5-dichloro-4-(4-fluoro-3-phenoxybenzyloxy)phenyl benzoate (88% yield).<br>
A reaction vessel was charged with 1.36 g of 3,5-dichloro-4-(4-fluoro-3-phenoxybenzyloxy)phenyl benzoate and 10 ml of methanol, to which 4.2 g of 10% potassium hydroxide solution was slowly added dropwise under ice cooling. After stirring for 1 hour, the reaction mixture was made weakly acidic by the addition of 10% hydrochloric acid, and extracted twice with 50 ml of diethyl ether under salting out. The combined ether layer was washed with water, dried with anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and concentrated to obtain a crude product. The crude product was subjected to silica gel chromatography, which afforded 0.97 g of 3,5-dichloro-4-(4-fluoro-3-phenoxybenzyl-oxy)phenol (91% yield), m.p. 144.8°C.<br>
Intermediate Production Example 2: Production of intermediate compound 2)<br>
A mixture of 2.27 g of 4-benzoyloxy-2,6-dichlorophenol, 1.29 g of 2-chloro-benzyl chloride, 1.21 g of potassium carbonate and 50 ml of N,N-dimethylformamide was stirred at 80°C for 6 hours. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, poured in ice water, and extracted twice with 50 ml of diethyl ether. The combined ether layer was washed with water, and dried with anhydrous magnesium sulfate, followed by removal of the solvent by distillation under reduced pressure. The residue was subjected to silica gel chromatography, which afforded 2.87 g of l-benzoyloxy-4-(2-chlorobenzyl-oxy)-3,5-dichlorobenzene (88% yield).<br>
To a mixture of 2.87 g of l-benzoyloxy-4-(2-chlorobenzyloxy)-3,5-dichloro-benzene and 100 ml of methanol was added dropwise 5.1 g of 10% (w/w) aqueous potassium hydroxide solution, while stirring at room temperature. After stirring at room temperature for 6 hours, the reaction mixture was made weakly acidic by the addition of 10% hydrochloric acid, and the methanol was removed by distillation under reduced pressure. The residue was extracted twice with 100 ml of ethyl acetate. The combined ether layer was washed with water, and dried with anhydrous magnesium sulfate,<br><br>
followed by removal of the solvent by distillation under reduced pressure. The residue was subjected to silica gel chromatography, which afforded 1.17 g of 4-(2-chlorobenzyl-oxy)-3,5-dichlorophenol (55% yield), m.p. 108.3°C.<br>
Intermediate Production Example 3: Production of intermediate compound 264)<br>
A mixture of 27 g of 2-ethyl-6-methylaniline, 36 ml of concentrated sulfuric acid and 100 ml of water was stirred at a temperature of 0-5°C, to which a solution of 16.1 g of sodium nitrite dissolved in 50 ml of water was added dropwise. Then, 150 g of cold water, 1.5 g of urea and 150 g of ice were added thereto.<br>
This aqueous solution was added dropwise to a mixture of 100 ml of sulfuric acid, 100 ml of water and 150 g of sodium sulfate, while heating to 135°C under stirring. At the same time, the mixture was subjected to steam distillation. After completion of the addition, an aqueous solution obtained by the steam distillation was subjected to salting out with sodium chloride, dried with anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and concentrated to obtain a crude product. The crude product was subjected to silica gel chromatography, which afforded 16 g of 2-ethyl-6-methylphenol (59% yield).<br>
