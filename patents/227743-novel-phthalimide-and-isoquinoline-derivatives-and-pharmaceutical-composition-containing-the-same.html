Related Applications<br>
This application claims priority under 35 USC ยง119(e) to US<br>
Provisional Application Serial Nos. 60/285,745, filed April 23, 2001 and 60/338,955,<br>
filed December 10, 2001, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention is directed to novel substituted phthalimide and<br>
isoquinoline derivatives, and the use of such derivatives as therapeutic agents. These<br>
compounds have been discovered to have anti-angiogenic activity.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Inappropriate angiogenesis is the cause or an aggravating factor in<br>
numerous disease states. For example, age related macular degeneration (ARMD)<br>
refers to a condition that steals away central vision but leaves peripheral (side) vision<br>
intact. This disease can be present in several forms and affects approximately 1 out of<br>
5 individuals over the age of 65 and 1 out of 4 over the age of 75. That represents<br>
approximately 20 million Americans.<br>
There are two forms of macular degeneration: dry macular<br>
degeneration and wet macular degeneration. The dry form, in which the cells of the<br>
macula slowly begin to break down, is diagnosed in 90 percent of macular<br>
degeneration cases. It may occur in one eye or both. The wet form, although it only<br>
accounts for 10 percent of the cases, results in 90 percent of the blindness. As the wet<br>
form worsens, patients begin to have abnormal blood vessels growing behind the<br>
macula. These vessels are very fragile and will leak fluid and blood (hence 'wet'<br>
macular degeneration), causing rapid damage to the macula. As of yet no specific<br>
pharmacological treatments are available.<br>
The wet form of ARMD and other ocular diseases caused by the<br>
formation of new blood vessels (neovascularization) are among the leading causes of<br>
blindness. Thus there is a great need for the discovery of new drugs to treat such<br>
ocular diseases. One approach is to administer pharmaceutical anti-angiogenic agents<br>
to prevent the inappropriate neovascularization.<br>
Novel anti-angiogenic compounds also have utility as anti-cancer<br>
agents. Malignancies are characterized by the growth and spread of tumors. One<br>
important factor in the progression of this disease is angiogenesis, a complex process<br>
in which capillary blood vessels grow in an ordered sequence of events. Once a tumor<br>
has started, every increase in tumor cell population must be preceded by an increase in<br>
new capillaries that converge on the tumor and supply the cells with oxygen and<br>
nutrients. Tumors may thus remain harmless and confined to their tissue of origin, as<br>
long as an accompanying angiogenic program is prevented from being activated.<br>
Since the angiogenesis-dependent step in tumor progression is shared by solid tumors<br>
of all etiologies, the ability to inhibit rumor-associated angiogenesis is a promising<br>
approach in combating cancer.<br>
A substantial body of experimental evidence supports the hypothesis<br>
that tumor angiogenesis is fundamental for the growth and metastasis of solid tumors<br>
[Folkman, J. Natl. Cancer Inst., Vol. 82, pp. 4-6 (1989); N. Weidner, et a!., Amer. J.<br>
Pathol., Vol. 143, pp. 401-409 (1993)]. Indeed, the majority of solid tumors are not<br>
even clinically detectable until after the occurrence of neovascularization, whose<br>
induction in solid tumors is mediated by one or more angiogenic factors.<br>
Furthermore, angiogenesis is also important in a number of other<br>
pathological processes, including arthritis, psoriasis, diabetic retinopathy, chronic<br>
inflammation, scleroderma, hemangioma, retrolental fibroplasia and abnormal<br>
capillary proliferation in hemophiliac joints, prolonged menstruation and bleeding,<br>
and other disorders of the female reproductive system.<br>
Accordingly, there is a need for compounds that have activity as anti-<br>
angiogenic agents and can be safely administered to patients to treat angiogenic-<br>
associated diseases. The present invention relates to a composition, comprising an<br>
anti-angiogenic compound, for use in treating angiogenic-associated diseases, as well<br>
as malignancies, including inhibition of primary tumor growth, tumor progression and<br>
metastasis. More particularly, the present invention is directed to thalidomide<br>
derivatives and their use as anti-angiogenic compositions.<br>
Thalidomide was originally prescribed as a sedative, however its use<br>
was discontinued when it was found to be a potent teratogen, causing serious birth<br>
defects, especially affecting limb development. The dysmelia (limb defects) seen with<br>
thalidomide is proposed to be caused by an inhibition of blood vessel growth in the<br>
developing fetal limb bud. Although this affect is vasculogenic (affecting the<br>
formation of a capillary bed), studies have demonstrated that thalidomide is also anti-<br>
angiogenic (affecting the formation of new blood vessels from sprouts of pre-existing<br>
vessels). Thalidomide is relatively nontoxic, when taken by nonpregnant adults and is<br>
now in phase 2 clinical trials as a potential anti-cancer agent as well as a treatment for<br>
vascular eye diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, retinopathy of prematurity, and<br>
macular degeneration.<br>
Thalidomide has been reported by Folkman, et. al. (PNAS, 91(9):4082-<br>
5, 1994) as having significant anti-angiogenic efficacy. The effects of thalidomide on<br>
corneal angiogenesis induced by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), has been<br>
reported (Kruse et al, Graefes Archive for Clinical &amp; Experimental Ophthalmology.<br>
236(6):461-6, 1998). In Kruse et al, corneal neovascularization was induced in<br>
rabbits by an intrastromal pellet loaded with 500 or 750 ng VEGF. Animals receiving<br>
two daily feedings of 200 mg/kg of thalidomide, responded with statistically<br>
significant inhibition (P 
treatment. This observation indicates that thalidomide has a significant anti-<br>
angiogenic effect against VEGF-induced ocular neovascular growth.<br>
Thalidomide has also demonstrated inhibitory effects on angiogenesis<br>
in the basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) induced rabbit corneal micropocket assay<br>
and orally in mice models (Joussen et al. Graefes Archive for Clinical &amp; Experimental<br>
Ophthalmology, 237(12):952-61, 1999 and Kenyon et al., Experimental Eye Research.<br>
64(6):971-8, 1997). Thalidomide and a thalidomide analog (cc-1069) have been<br>
reported to inhibit the in vitro proliferation of endothelial cells, (cells which make up<br>
the vascular system). The results of this study revealed a significant decrease in<br>
endothelial cell proliferation in cultures treated with thalidomide and/or cc-1069.<br>
Taken together, these data support a strong correlation between the anti-angiogenjc<br>
potential and inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation for thalidomide.<br>
Studies reveal that the S(-)-enantiomer of thalidomide has the strongest<br>
anti-angiogenic activity in both VEGF-induced and bFGF-induced corneal<br>
neovascularization. This enantioselective preference lends support to a possible<br>
receptor mediated mechanism. The present invention is directed to a novel series of<br>
thalidomide analogs and the use of such analogs as inhibitors of angiogenesis. More<br>
particularly, the thalidomide analogs of the present invention lack the piperidine-2,6-<br>
dione moiety of thalidomide.<br>

In accordance with one embodiment the thalidomide derivative<br>
compounds of the present invention can be formulated as pharmaceutical<br>
compositions by combining the compounds with one or more pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carriers. These formulations can be administered by standard routes. In<br>
general, the combinations may be administered by the topical, transdermal, oral, rectal<br>
or parenteral (e.g., intravenous, subcutaneous or intramuscular) route. In addition, the<br>
combinations may be incorporated into biodegradable polymers allowing for sustained<br>
release of the compound, the polymers being implanted in the vicinity of where drug<br>
delivery is desired, for example, at the site of a tumor. Biodegradable polymers<br>
suitable for use with the present invention are known to the skilled practitioner and<br>
are described in detail, for example, in Brem et al., J. Neurosurg. 74:441-446 (1991).<br>
In addition to the use of such pharmaceutical compositions as anti-<br>
angiogenic compounds, the thalidomide derived compounds and corresponding<br>
compositions also have utility as sodium channel blockers, calcium channel blockers,<br>
contraceptives, anti-inflammatory agents and anti-cancer agents. In one embodiment<br>
a composition comprising a thalidomide derivative of the present invention is used to<br>
treat age related macular degeneration.<br>
In accordance with one embodiment the present composition are<br>
administered either orally or parenterally. When administered orally, the compounds<br>
are administered as a liquid solution, powder, tablet, capsule or lozenge. The<br>
compounds can be used in combination with one or more conventional<br>
pharmaceutical additives or excipients used in the preparation of tablets, capsules,<br>
lozenges and other orally administrable forms. When administered parenterally, and<br>
more preferably by intravenous injection, the derivatives of the present invention can<br>
be admixed with saline solutions and/or conventional IV solutions.<br><br>
The dosage of the active compound will depend on the condition being<br>
treated, the particular compound, and other clinical factors such as weight and<br>
condition of the human or animal and the route of administration of the compound. It<br>
is to be understood that the present invention has application for both human and<br>
veterinary use. For oral administration to humans, a dosage of between approximately<br>
0.1 to 300 mg/kg/day, preferably between approximately 0.5 and 50 mg/kg/day, and<br>
most preferably between approximately 1 to 10 mg/kg/day, is generally sufficient.<br>
It should be understood that in addition to the active anti-angiogenic<br>
compounds, the compositions of the present invention may include other agents<br>
conventional in the art including solubilizing agents, inert fillers, diluents, excipients<br>
and flavoring agents.<br>
In accordance with one embodiment, diseases associated with corneal<br>
neovascularization can be treated by administering a composition comprising a<br>
compound having the general structure:<br>
wherein R1 is selected from the group consisting of H, halo, alkyl, haloalkyl,<br>
-NR5R6, hydroxy and alkoxy;<br>
R2 is selected from the group consisting of<br>
R8 is selected from the group consisting of H and alkyl, or R3 and R8 taken<br>
together, can form with the adjacent ring, an optionally substituted C5-C6 cycloalkyl or<br>
C5-C6 aromatic ring;<br>
R10 and R11 are independently selected from the group consisting of H, halo,<br>
C1-C4 haloalkyl, -NR5R7, hydroxy and C1-C8 alkoxy or R10 and R11 taken together, can<br>
form with the adjacent ring, an optionally substituted C5-C6 cycloalkyl or optionally<br>
substituted C5-C6 aromatic ring;<br>
R5 and R7 are independently H, or C1-C4 alkyl;<br>
RI2 is selected from the group consisting of H, halo and C1-C8 alkoxy;<br>
m is an integer ranging from 0-4; and<br>
R6 is C1-C8 alkyl. In one embodiment the compound has the general structure<br>
wherein R1 is H or halo; and<br>
R2 is selected from the group consisting of<br>
wherein R10 and R11 are independently H, halo or C1-C4 alkoxy, R1 and Rl2 are<br>
H, and R6 is C1-C6 alkyl.<br>
Another disease which can be treated according to the present<br>
invention is rheumatoid arthritis. It is believed that the blood vessels in the synovial<br>
lining of the joints undergo angiogenesis. In addition to forming new vascular<br>
networks, the endothelial cells release factors and reactive oxygen species that lead to<br>
pannus growth and cartilage destruction. The factors involved in angiogenesis may<br>
actively contribute to, and help maintain, the chronically inflamed state of rheumatoid<br>
arthritis.<br>
The thalidomide derived compounds of the present invention are also<br>
anticipated to have use in treating a wide variety of diseases or conditions that are<br>
related to angiogenesis, including diabetic retinopathy, retinopathy of prematurity,<br>
corneal graft rejection, neovascular glaucoma and retrolental fibroplasia, epidemic<br>
keratoconjunctivitis, Vitamin A deficiency, contact lens overwear, atopic keratitis,<br>
superior limbic keratitis, pterygium keratitis sicca, sjogrens, acne rosacea,<br>
phylectenulosis, syphilis, Mycobacteria infections, lipid degeneration, chemical bums,<br>
bacterial ulcers, fungal ulcers, Herpes simplex infections, Herpes zoster infections,<br>
protozoan infections, Kaposi sarcoma, Mooren ulcer, Terrien's marginal degeneration,<br>
mariginal keratolysis, trauma, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus, polyarteritis,<br>
Wegeners sarcoidosis, Scleritis, Steven's Johnson disease, pemphigoid radial<br>
keratotomy, and corneal graph rejection. Diseases associated with retinal/choroidal<br>
neovascularization that can also be treated according to the present invention and<br>
include, but are not limited to, diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration, sickle cell<br>
anemia, sarcoid, syphilis, pseudoxanthoma elasticum, Pagets disease, vein occlusion,<br>
artery occlusion, carotid obstructive disease, chronic uveitis/vitritis, mycobacteria!<br>
infections, Lyme's disease, systemic lupus erythematosis, retinopathy of prematurity,<br>
Eales disease, Bechets disease, infections causing a retinitis or choroiditis, presumed<br>
ocular histoplasmosis, Bests disease, myopia, optic pits, Stargarts disease, pars<br>
planitis, chronic retinal detachment, hyperviscosity syndromes, toxoplasmosis, trauma<br>
and post-laser complications.<br>
Example 1<br>
Molecular modeling was used to facilitate the design of a novel series<br>
of isoquinolines. Initially, a one carbon addition to the imide ring was considered to<br>
prepare compounds of the general structure:<br>
Conformational analysis of this phthalimide analog, docked in the crystal structure of<br>
polyADP-ribose polymerase, revealed the conformational similarity of the proposed<br>
structural mimic with phthalimides. With this in mind, the synthesis of two initial<br>
series of analogs was proposed as a preliminary set of synthetic targets.<br>
These compounds represent first generation analogs which investigate important<br>
structure and enantioselective relationships for isoquinolines. The synthesis of<br>
mimics 1-10 is outlined in Scheme 1 and represents reasonable literature reported<br>
organic transformations. The utility of this synthetic scheme allows for the insertion<br>
of a large diversity of functional groups. Furthermore the synthetic design allows for<br>
the straightforward synthesis of enantiomerically pure final products through the<br>
addition of selected chiral amino acids.<br>
Scheme I. Synthetic Scheme for Analogs in this Study<br>
Example 2<br>
Additional compounds were prepared wherein the piperidine-2,6-dione moiety<br>
of thalidomide is replaced with a rigid or open ring structure having the general<br>
structure:<br>
wherein R22 is aryl and R23 is H, C1-C12 alkyl, C2-C12 alkenyl or C2-Cl2 alkynyl, or R22<br>
and R23 together with the intervening carbons form an aryl. The synthetic schemes<br>
used to prepare these compounds is as follows:<br>
Synthesis of 2-Indan-5-yl-l,3-dioxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-isoindole-5-carboxylic acid<br>
These compounds will be evaluated for their ability to inhibit corneal<br>
neovascularization and endothelial cell proliferation.<br>
Example 3<br>
Endothelial cell proliferation assay.<br>
The human vascular endothelial cells (HUVECS) were cultured to<br>
peri-confluence (80%) in 20% serum and treated with thalidomide (standard) or its<br>
analog (40-400 ยตM). After 20 h, [3H]-thymidine (2 ยตCi/ml) was added to the culture<br>
medium for 2-4 h. The [3H]-thymidine incorporation was stopped with ice-cold PBS<br>
(3 washes) and the cells were incubated with cold 10% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) for<br>
10 min at 4ยบC. The cells were further incubated with TCA at room temperature for<br>
10 mm and washed three times with PBS. The cells were solubilized overnight with<br>
1N NaOH and neutralized with an equivalent amount of 1N HC1 before radioactivity<br>
was determined. The anti-proliferative activity of thalidomide or its analog was<br>
computed as a percent inhibition of HUVECS mitogenic response to 20% serum (fetal<br>
calf serum).<br>
Evaluation of thalidomide for inhibition of the incorporation of 3H-<br>
thymidine into endothelial cells reveal this compound to have an IC50 of 200 ยตM.<br>
Preliminary IC50 data for the first panel of compounds reveal four compounds (5, 29,<br>
32 and 50) to have 2-4 times greater potency than thalidomide in inhibiting 3H-<br>
thymidine incorporation into endothelial cells (See Table 1). This structure activity<br>
relationship (SAR) establishes that the piperidine-2,6-dione moiety is not needed for<br>
increased inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation.<br>
