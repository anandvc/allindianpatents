[Document]      Specification<br>
[Title of the lnventionl LEAD ROUTE GUIDANCE SYSTEM, PORTABLE ROUTE LEAD GUIDANCE DEVICE, AND PROGRAM<br>
[Technical Field]<br>
The present invention relates to a lead route guidance system that uses such a portable route lead guidance device that is capable of providing route guidance, as a mobile telephone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), and a personal notebook computer. More particularly, the invention relates to a lead route guidance system, a portable route lead guidance device, and a program that are capable of providing lead route guidance even when the position of a portable terminal is indeterminable.<br>
[Related Art]<br>
In recent years there has been remarkable development in mobile telephones and other portable terminals. Whereas previously mobile telephones were simply terminal devices for telephone calls, they have come to be used as general portable terminal devices that perform data communication by connecting to various servers via networks such as the Internet, and the popularity of portable terminals has become extremely high. In particular, the trend is such that in what is termed the third generation of mobile telephones, all models will carry positioning units — such as global positioning system (GPS) receivers that determine position by receiving signals from GPS satellites - now carried by only some mobile telephones.<br>
The positioning technology for the current position of a portable terminal utilizing a built-in GPS receiver has already been in use for car navigation systems and communication navigation systems, and the positioning accuracy has been improved. However, since the reception of signals from GPS satellites is an essential prerequisite, it is not so suitable for the use in underground malls as well as inside the buildings under the present situation.<br>
As for the technology to identify the position of a portable terminal without<br><br>
relying on GPS, for example, Patent Document 1 (JP-A-2002-109679) discloses such a positional information providing system. This is a positional information providing system that provides information to a traveler, constituting a traveler's path within a specific area as a passage network by using a physical means set on roads, and providing passage network nodes and terminal points with an information communication means that allows a radio communication access. Further, in this system, each of the information communication means of the nodes and terminal points of the passage network and of the traveler has a unique independent number. Independent signals corresponding to the independent numbers are transmitted to a central processing unit, and processed appropriately to create a positional information database of the traveler. Then, this system provides the traveler's positional information to the traveler or to a third person via the Internet, utilizing the positional information database.<br>
Patent Document 2 (JP-A-2003-344093) discloses a route guidance system that provides route guidance to a portable terminal at places where the reception of GPS signals is impossible such as underground malls. Thus, this route guidance system is to enable an operator as a pedestrian to recognize the current position properly and to understand a route to his/her destination easily, even at places where the recognition of the current position is difficult such as underground malls. This route guidance system is constituted by a route searching section for searching an underground route based on map data, a route guidance data creating section for creating guidance data to guide through the searched underground route based on the map data and guidance signboard data, and a transmission data creating section for creating transmission data for displaying character strings of guidance signboards on a display screen based on the created guidance data.<br>
Further, Patent Document 3 (JP-A 2004-20345) also discloses a guidance device that obtains data from a guidance signboard.<br>
[Patent Document 11 JP-A-2002-109679 [Patent Document 21 JP-A-2003-344093 [Patent Document 3]   JP-A-2004-20345<br><br>
[Disclosure of the Invention] [Problems to be Solved]<br>
The related-art methods, however, require the provision of some sort of device on paths in order to obtain the current position from a communication means such as a terminal point or to obtain the current position likewise from a signboard. It is feasible to provide such devices within a limited area, but it is impractical to provide such devices in all paths accessible in terms of cost and management.<br>
Further, in general, when a user walks, he/she walks looking ahead towards the direction of travel and seldom walks looking at both sides of the path to confirm. However, as a route guidance image on an information display screen of a portable terminal shows the current position, what are shown in the route guidance image are such landmarks as buildings and signboards on both sides of the user, rather than the landmarks in front of the user following his/her line of vision. This causes the user to be confused and to take a wrong way by turning at an intersection behind a landmark.<br>
In view of the above mentioned problems, the present invention provides a lead route guidance system, a portable route lead guidance device, and a program that provide a route guidance display that ensures the user not to cause any confusion by the difference between the user's line of vision and the route guidance image, as to solve a first technical problem.<br>
The present invention also provides a lead route guidance system, a portable route lead guidance device, and a program that enable guidance without making mistakes on a route even in the situation where obtaining positional information by GPS is impossible, as to solve a second technical problem.<br>

The lead position detecting means KC16 detects a lead position on the route farther ahead of the current position of the user, in order to lead the user carrying the mobile telephone 1 on the route, based on the output signal from the GPS device and the judging of walking. KC16A: Lead position storage means<br>
The lead position storage means KC16A stores the lead position.   At the start of the route guidance, the current position of the user (the starting point) is stored as the lead position. KC16B: Lead speed setting means<br>
The lead speed setting means KC16B has a lead speed storage means KC16B1 and a staircase judging means KC16B2, and sets, according to the user's walking, a moving speed (a lead speed) of the lead position that moves irrelevant to the current position of the user.

Fig. 4 is an illustration of a moving distance across a staircase.<br><br>
m_;ibi5i: JLeaci speea storage means<br>
The lead speed storage means KC16B1 stores the lead speed. The lead speed storage means KC16B1 of the first embodiment stores a value of 84 m/min. that is 5% faster than the general user's walking speed of 80 m/min. as the lead speed for a normal path (the normal lead speed), and stores a value of 42 m/min. that is one half the normal lead speed as the lead speed for a staircase (the staircase lead speed). In Fig. 4, as for the data of a route network used in route searching, when a route (a link) is a staircase, a projected distance on the horizontal plane (length U in Fig. 4), instead of the actual distance of the route (length L in Fig. 4), is registered as a distance cost (a route link distance). Thus, for the staircase section of the route, when the moving distance is calculated using the normal lead speed, the lead position (and the current position) is apt to move too fast and an error gets to be increased. In general, when the user walks on a staircase, his/her walking pitch tends to become a little faster, but strides become shorter than that in a normal path. Therefore, the lead speed storage means KC16B1 of the first embodiment stores the speed of one half (1/2) the normal lead speed as the staircase lead speed. In the first embodiment, the staircase lead speed is set to 1/2 of the normal lead speed, but it is possible to set to an appropriate value, such as 1/3, not limited to 1/2. Also, the normal lead speed is set to the speed 5% faster than the general walking speed, but it is possible to set to any arbitrary values, not limited to this, such as 10% faster, and is also possible to set a lead speed based on the actual walking speed of the user derived from integrating the acceleration data.<br>

When it is instructed to execute<br><br>
updating by the user entry,  while the lead position updating is  suspended, it executes (resumes) updating the lead position.<br>
KC16C1: Lead position moving distance calculating means<br>
The lead position moving distance calculating means KC16C1 calculates the moving distance of the lead position along the route when walking is detected, based on walking time (the duration of time to judge walking, 0.5 seconds in the first embodiment) and the lead speed set by the lead speed setting means KC16B. KC16D: Lead position update instruction judging means<br>

A guidance point judging means KC17 has a guidance distance calculating means KC17A, a guidance point approach judging means KC17B, and a guidance point arrival judging means KC17C, and judges, based on the data for guidance points of the route guidance data, whether the lead position has approached or arrived at a guidance point or not.<br>
KC17A: Guidance distance calculating means<br>
The guidance distance calculating means KC17A calculates the distance from the lead position to the next guidance point on a route. KC17B: Guidance point approach judging means<br>
The guidance point approach judging means KC17B judges whether the distance to the guidance point has become less than a predefined approach judging distance or not. The guidance point approach judging means KC17B of the first embodiment stores a value of 100 m as the approach judging distance. The approach judging distance is not limited to 100 m, and it is possible to set at values such as 50 m, 300 m and so on. Also, the approach judging distance is not limited to have one single value, and it is possible to have a plurality of values (50 m, 100 m, 150 m, etc.) and to change the notifying methods (displaying image, flashing signal, driving the vibration motor, etc.) according to the distance values. KC17C: Guidance point arrival judging means<br><br>
The guidance point arrival judging means KC17C judges whether the lead position has arrived at a guidance point, thus the distance to the guidance point has become 0 (or less), or not.<br>

In ST42, the spectral analysis interval timer TMO is set at the spectral analysis interval tO.   Then, the process moves no to ST43.<br>
In ST43, whether the spectral interval timer TMO has suspended counting or not is judged.    In case of No (N), ST43 is repeated.   In case of Yes (v<br><br>
process moves on to ST44.<br>
In ST44, the spectrum analysis is performed by the fast Fourier transform (FFT) after calculation of the magnitude of acceleration based on the acceleration data stored.    Then, the process moves on to ST45.<br>
In ST45, from the result of the FFT analysis, whether the spectrum that has the spectral intensity at or over the spectral intensity threshold Ns within the frequency range of 1 to 4 Hz is judged. In case of Yes (Y), the process moves on to ST46.   In case of No (N), the process moves on to ST47.<br>
In ST46, it is judged that the user has walked, thus walking is detected. Then, the process moves on to ST48.<br>
In ST47, it is judged that the user is not walking and stops. Then, the process moves on to ST48.<br>
In ST48, whether an input to terminate the navigation program (the route lead guidance program) has been entered or not is judged. In case of No (N), the process moves on to ST42. In case of Yes (Y), the walk detecting process shown in Fig. 10 is terminated.<br>
(Operation of the first embodiment)<br>
Fig. 11 is an example graph of the acceleration data measured on the mobile telephone while the user is walking carrying the portable terminal of the first embodiment, with the acceleration on the vertical axis and the time on the horizontal axis.<br>
Fig. 12 is a graph of the spectral analysis result of the acceleration data in Fig. 11, with the spectral intensity on the vertical axis and the spectral value on the horizontal axis.<br>
In Figs. 11 and 12, with the portable navigation system (the route lead guidance system) S of the first embodiment configured as described, when the user walks carrying the mobile telephone 1 while the route lead guidance program is running, the cyclic acceleration in the direction of three axes of X-axis, Y-axis and Z-axis are detected by the three-axis acceleration sensor SNl. The cyclic acceleration data detected by the acceleration sensor SNl are sampled at a sampling frequency of 64 Hz (refer to Fig. 11).   Then, when the spectral analysis of<br><br>
the total acceleration that is the magnitude of acceleration on the three-axis directions (refer to Fig. 11) for a duration of 0.5 seconds is made by the fast Fourier transform (FFT), as indicated in Fig. 12, the result of the spectral analysis obtained shows strong spectral intensities at frequencies of 2 Hz and 3 Hz. When such a result is obtained, it is judged that the user has walked, thus the mobile telephone 1 detects walking.<br>
In the step ST19 in Fig. 9 (the walk detecting process in Fig. 10), when walking is detected, the lead position is updated irrelevant to the current position of the user. At this time, as the lead speed is set faster than the general user's walking speed, the lead icon 23a moves ahead of the current position of the user along the route (refer to Fig. 5A). Therefore, as the lead icon 23a moves ahead of the user, buildings and the like ahead of the route are displayed in the route guidance image 24, thus the user can confirm them. This method makes the user less likely to get confused from the difference between the line of his/her vision and the route guidance image 24.<br>
When the lead position approaches a guidance point such as corners, foot and head of stairs and so on, the guidance icon 28 is indicated giving the guidance to the user (refer to Fig. 5B). While the lead icon 23a is moving, selecting the "STOP" toggle key (the moving toggle key image 29a), when the user feels that the lead position and the current position are too far apart, makes it shift from the status indicated in Fig. 5B to the status indicated in Fig. 5C, updating the moving lead icon 23a to the standby lead icon 23b and stopping the movement of the lead icon 23 (refer to ST20 in Fig. 9). At this time, as the toggle key image 29 has been updated to the "GO toggle key (standby toggle key image 29b) automatically, selecting the toggle key by the user makes it change from the status indicated in Fig. 5C to the status indicated in Fig. 5B (refer to ST32 and such in Fig. 9) resuming the movement of the lead icon 23. Thus, in the route lead guidance system of the first embodiment, as to stop or to resume the movement of the lead icon 23 is instructed by the same input action of selecting the toggle key, the user can easily make the instructions. Since the lead icon 23 and the toggle key image 29 differ between the moving and standing by states, the user can easily confirm if<br><br>
the route lead guidance is in progress or in standby (the lead position is being updated or not).<br>
In Figs. 5D to 5F, when the lead position moves along the route and arrives at a guidance point such as corners, foot and head of stairs and such, the lead icon 23 stops moving automatically (refer to ST29 and such in Fig. 9). Thus, the lead icon 23 arrives at the guidance point earlier and waits for the user. When the user confirms the guidance point and enters to the select "GO" toggle key (the standby toggle key image 29b) as he/she approaches or arrives at the guidance point, updating the lead position is resumed and the lead icon 23a moves on towards the next guidance point. Therefore, with the route lead guidance system of the first embodiment, as it suspends updating the lead position automatically at every guidance point, and resumes moving the lead icon 23 according to the user entry, it allows the user to confirm the guidance point and it reduces the occasion where the lead position and the current position of the user become too far apart as the lead icon 23a moves too much.<br>
As the route lead guidance system S of the first embodiment updates the lead position by detecting walking of the user, the route guidance can be given even in underground and inside the buildings and the like where the reception of the GPS radiowave is impossible. Further, as the route lead guidance system S of the first embodiment does not require devices for obtaining the current position within the buildings as in the case of the related art, it makes it easy to implement and reduces the costs required for the equipment.<br>
As the route lead guidance system S of the first embodiment updates the lead position by detecting walking of the user, it prevents the occasion where the lead position and the current position of the user become too far apart as the lead position moves on its own while the user is standing still.<br>
[Industrial Applicability] (Modification examples)<br>
The preferred embodiment of the present invention has been described above.    However, the present invention is not limited to the preferred embodiment,<br><br>
and various modifications can be made within the spirit and scope of the claims of the present invention.<br>
For example, in the first embodiment, although the portable route guidance device with the GPS device has been described, the invention is also applicable to the portable route guidance device without the GPS device.<br>
In the first embodiment, although only the lead position is detected and the current position of the user is not detected, it is also possible to detect the current position of the user and add the current position icon for indicating the current position on the route guidance image 24 in addition to the lead icon 23. In this case, for instance, when the lead position becomes too far apart from the current position (300 m or more apart, for example), it can be configured to automatically suspend updating the lead position until the current position comes closer to some extent to the lead position.<br>
Further, the portable route guidance device of the present invention is not limited to the mobile telephone 1, but it is applicable to portable devices (the portable route guidance device) such as a PDA and a personal notebook computer. In addition to these, this function can also be implemented on a portable music player (a headphone stereo, MP3 player, and such) and the like.<br>
In the first embodiment, the delivery of the map data and the search of routes have been done by the communication with the portable navigation data delivery server 7. However, when the data storage capacity and the processing speed of the portable route guidance device are sufficient enough, the portable route guidance device can store the whole map data and search routes, allowing the communication with the portable navigation data delivery server 7 to be omitted. Conversely, it can also be configured for the mobile telephone 1 to perform the detecting of walking and for the portable navigation data delivery server 7 to perform updating of the lead position, the guidance point approach and arrival, and the creation of route guidance images and so on, so that the route guidance images transmitted from the portable navigation data delivery server 7 to be displayed on the mobile telephone 1.<br>
In the first embodiment, although the moving distance has been calculated<br><br>
based on the lead speed and the walking time, not limited to this, it is possible to calculate the moving distance based on the stride (a moving distance of the lead position per step) and the number of steps that has been counted by detecting the peaks of vibrations from the acceleration data. Instead, by storing the plural number of lead speeds for walks at a quick pace, at a slow pace and so on, it is possible to select the walk speed to use depending on the spectrum value detected by the spectral analysis. Conversely, it is also possible to use the normal lead speed only. For example, it is possible to calculate the moving distance by setting the walk speed at a value of 60 m/min. when the most powerful spectrum value is found at 1.5 Hz or less and at the value of 100 m/min. when the most powerful spectrum is found at 3 Hz or more. It is also possible to configure it to input the lead speed directly by the user or to configure it to input the walk speed so that the lead speed is set at a value of 10% more than the walk speed entered.<br>
In the first embodiment, the specific values such as the value of sampling frequency, the duration for storing acceleration data, the value of spectral intensity threshold are not limited to the values indicated above, and they can be changed.<br>
Further, in the first embodiment, although the walking spectrums fw for detecting walking have been set in a frequency range of 1 to 4 Hz, not limited to this range, it can be set at 2 Hz when it is not required to detect walking at a quick pace and a slow pace, and set in a range of 1.5 to 2.5 Hz when it is not required to detect walking at a quick pace.<br>
In the first embodiment, the walk detecting storage means KC4 is described as the module having the acceleration data storage means KC4A, the spectral analysis means KC4C, the analysis result storage means KC4D, and the walk judging means KC4E. However, the acceleration data storage means KC4A, the spectral analysis means KC4C, and such can be configured as a separate module. In this case, the walk detecting means KC4 should be configured to obtain necessary information from the module having the acceleration data storage means KC4A, the spectral analysis means KC4C, and such.<br>
In the first embodiment, although the lead icons are switched for updating and for suspending updating, it is possible to use the same icon for both.   Also, the<br><br>
lead icon is not limited to the human-shaped image, and it is possible to use any arbitrary lead images.<br>
Further, in the first embodiment, as for the lead position update instruction image, the toggle key images that automatically switche between "STOP" and "GO" sequentially at every entry are used. However, it is not limited to this. For example, while showing both images of "STOP" and "GO", it is possible to process only one side and not to process the other when the input is entered.<br>
In addition, in the first embodiment, while the route lead guidance on the route including a staircase is described, the invention is also applicable to the route lead guidance including an escalator, an elevator and other transfer means where the detection of walking is rather difficult. For example, at first, the route lead guidance to the floor where an access to an escalator and such is located is performed, and when the lead position arrives at the access to the escalator (a guidance point), the toggle key is switched from "STOP" to "GO". When the user gets off the escalator and such and selects to enter the "GO" toggle key, the route lead guidance of the floor where the user has got off the escalator can be performed. As a result of this, the route lead guidance can be performed even when the transfer means such as an escalator are used.<br>
In the first embodiment, although the lead position is suspended updating when arriving at a guidance point, the position can be continuously updated. Further, although updating of the lead position is executed and suspended according to the instruction of the user entry, this configuration can also be omitted.<br>
In the first embodiment, although walking is detected by using the three-dimensional acceleration sensor, not limited to this, it is possible to detect walking using two-dimensional acceleration sensors or other configurations that can detect walking.<br>
Further, in the first embodiment, although the guidance icon is displayed when approaching a guidance point, not limited to this, it is also possible to notify the user the lead position has approached or arrived at the guidance point by any arbitrary methods such as flashing signals, driving the vibration motor, playing back sound effects, or the combination thereof.<br><br>
Also, the guidance  displayed on the display screen 11 can be configured by contents such as animations and movies, besides the still images. To playback such guidance icons, when the route lead guidance device 1 is a mobile telephone, for example, the application platform called Macromedia Flash Player of Macromedia can be used.<br>
