3.   PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br><br>
                             Ball joint, preferably for use in motor vehicles <br>
                                                    Description <br>
The invention relates to a ball joint, preferably for use in motor vehicles, in particular in the region of the chassis of motor vehicles, with a ball joint housing having a joint orifice, a ball pin disposed in the ball joint housing extending through the joint orifice on which a shaft is formed, with a bearing ring disposed on the shaft of the ball pin and a seal element which is disposed between the bearing ring and a connecting component surrounding the shaft of the ball pin, of the type outlined in the introductory part of claim 1.<br>
With ball joints, it is usually necessary to ensure that the joint parts are able to move relative to one another without functioned restrictions, at least during a predetermined period of usage for the relevant type of ball joint. At the same time, it is necessary to ensure a satisfactory seal against outside influences, in particular to prevent ingress by foreign bodies and moisture. Bearing rings disposed on the ball pin of the ball joint are used for this purpose, to which the pin-side seal labyrinth of a sealing bellows can be sealingly affixed.<br>
In this connection, a ball joint for motor vehicles is known from patent specification DE-OS 37 05 847, which has a sealing collar made from an elastically deformable material between the housing of the ball joint and a ball pin supporting the ball joint. A bearing ring adhered to the ball pin is inserted between the bearing surface of the sealing collar and the ball pin, which positively engages with the bearing surface of the sealing collar.<br>
With this solution, the seal in the region of the bearing ring is achieved by providing the bearing ring with a coating of an elastic material.<br>
Another ball joint is known from patent specification DE 103 00 678 Al, which essentially comprises a ball pin and a ball pan for retaining the head of the ball pin with a bearing inserted in between.  The ball joint also has a retaining ring<br><br>
comprising a cylindrical part which is mounted on an external peripheral surface of the shaft of the ball pin and a flange, which stands proud of one end of the cylindrical part of the retaining ring and moves into intimate contact with a fixing bead of a sleeve.<br>
In the context of this teaching, the region in which the retaining ring is mounted on the shaft of the ball pin is filled with a sealing means which, being a liquid, penetrates recesses in this region.<br>
The underlying objective of the invention is to improve a ball joint so that its functional capability is preserved for relatively long periods, irrespective of the specific structural shape of the joint, without being detrimentally affected by the occurrence of corrosion in the region of the ball pin.<br>
This objective is achieved by the invention on the basis of a ball joint of the type described above, due to the fact that the sealing element used to seal the shaft of the ball pin is provided in the form of an elastically and/ or plastically deformable profiled body, the effective cross-section of which not acted on by forces is bounded by a continuously extending, curved contour which is subjected to a deformation in the fitted state, as a result of which at least a part region of the contour lies against the adjoining regions to be sealed.<br>
The advantage of the invention is that, as a result of the ability of the profiled body to deform elastically and/or plastically, its material properties and geometric design in particular, such as the contour of the cross-section, are specifically selected so that the required sealing action is achieved depending on the fitted position and the initial tension acting on the profiled body.<br>
In order to achieve a selective sealing function of the sealing element provided in the form of a profiled body, the elastically and/or plastically deformable profiled body proposed by the invention has a profiled base body and seal segments. The relevant<br>
3<br><br>
seal segment is therefore specifically adapted to the sealing function to be achieved, due to the way it is disposed on and joined to the profiled base body, amongst other things. Accordingly, at least some of the seal segments preferably extend in an essentially radial direction by reference to the profiled base body.<br>
To enable the deflection behaviour of the seal segments to be controlled as a function of use, if necessary to obtain a response behaviour based on a specific number of seal segments, transition regions may be provided for joining the profiled base body to the seal segments, the shape and material of which are selected so that the seal segment adjoining the respective transition region is elastically deflected due to initial tension.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the profiled body has a connecting surface, by means of which the profiled body is connected to an adjoining component.<br>
The adjoining component is preferably the bearing ring to be disposed on the ball pin of the ball joint. This being the case, the profiled body may be joined to the bearing ring by vulcanisation or by adhesion.<br>
It is also possible to position the profiled body on the shaft of the ball pin or on the bearing ring in preparation for mounting the ball joint. The profiled body can expediently be positioned as a result of a radial widening thereof by means of a positive and/or non-positive connection on the relevant component.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the invention, the bearing ring has a radially extending flange, against which at least one seal segment of the profiled body lies due to initial tension. In addition or as an alternative to this, at least one seal segment of the profiled body may lied pre-tensioned against the radially outer end face of the flange of the bearing ring, thereby enabling a redundant seal system to be achieved on this basis.<br>
4<br><br>
In order to achieve defined elasticity and sealing properties, the profiled body may have strengthening elements in the form of strip-shaped or rounded material, the purpose of which is to strengthen the core structure of the transition regions to the seal segments and the seal segments themselves.<br>
The invention will be explained in more detail below on the basis of an example of an embodiment illustrated in the appended drawings.<br>
Of these:<br>
Fig. 1	is a diagram showing an overall view of an articulated connection in<br>
the form of a ball joint with a profiled body as proposed by the invention,<br>
Figs. 2-4         are diagrams illustrating the detail X indicated in Fig. 1 with profiled bodies in the fitted and hence initially tensioned state, which are respectively different from one another in terms of their cross-sectional contour, and<br>
Fig. 5	is a diagram in section illustrating other profiled bodies which are not<br>
pre-tensioned.<br>
The articulated connection schematically illustrated in Fig. 1 is a known ball joint with which the skilled person will be familiar. The explanation of the structure of the ball joint can therefore be limited to the most important elements.<br>
The ball joint essentially comprises a ball pin 1, a bearing shell 2 and a housing 3 at least partially enclosing the ball pin 1 and bearing shell 2. The ball joint is sealed in the transition region from the housing 3 to the ball pin 1 by means of a sealing bellows 4, which is held in the sealing position by means of a bearing ring 5, a round clamping ring 6 and a flat clamping ring 7, permitting a change in the relative bearing position of the ball pin 1 with respect to the housing 3.<br>
5<br><br>
The housing 3 is in turn made from two parts and comprises a housing base body 8 and a closure cover 9 which closes the housing 3 on the side remote from the ball pin 1 when the ball pin 1 is inserted in the housing base body 8.<br>
The ball pin 1 has a conically extending shaft 10 which is connected in a positive and non-positive fit to a connecting component 11 and supports the bearing ring 5, which in turn is provided in the form of a base web 12 lying on the shaft 10 of the ball pin 1 and a flange 13 extending at an angle with respect to the base web 12.<br>
The flange 13 of the bearing ring 5 and a reference surface 14 of the connecting component 11 are at least partially separated by a pre-tensioned seal element provided in the form of a profiled body 15. Since the sealing action of the profiled body 15 occurs at a radial distance from the peripheral surface of the shaft 10 of the ball pin 1, the ball pin 1 is effectively protected against corrosion.<br>
Figures 2 to 4 illustrate different profiled bodies 15, both in the tension-free state and in the pre-tensioned position fitted in the ball joint. They each comprise a profiled base body 16 with transition regions 17 which are adjoined by seal segments 18. The seal segments 18 determine the continuously extending contour 19 of the sealing cross-section of the profiled body 15 relevant to the sealing action. In the case of the profiled body 15 illustrated in Fig. 2, for example, a particularly efficient sealing action is achieved due to the fact that the two seal segments 18 lying radially towards the outside form a first barrier created between the flange 13 of the bearing ring 5 and the reference surface 14 of the connecting component 11, and a multiple redundancy is achieved due to a third and fourth seal segment 18 lying pre-tensioned against the shaft 10 of the ball pin 1 in a sealing arrangement.<br>
The shaft 10 of the ball pin 1 is sealed by profiled bodies 15 provided with seal segments 18 essentially due to a compression or deflection of the relevant seal segment 18 under the effect of force and by the presence of transition regions 17 due to a deflection of the seal segments 18 as a result of the elastic properties of the<br>
6<br><br>
transition regions 17.<br>
In the case of the elongate profiled body 15 illustrated in Fig. 3, the seal segments 18 are designed with a large volume so that a seal segment 18 sits flat in abutment with the shaft 10 of the ball pin 1 on the one hand and the seal segment 18 lying opposite it engages round the flange 13 of the bearing ring 5 and moves into abutment with the end face 20 of the flange 13, on the other hand.<br>
Within the scope of the invention, therefore, irrespective of the embodiment chosen, seal segments 18 of different designs can be combined on a profiled body 15 in order to achieve the desired sealing effect at the respective sealing position of the seal segment 18 and obtain a redundant seal system due to the co-operation of the seal segments 18.<br>
The specific feature of the profiled body 15 illustrated in Fig. 4 resides in the fact that the transition regions 17 merge into the profiled base body 16 and into the seal segments 18 with a continuously extending radius of curvature so that the elastic properties of the profiled base body 16 play a part in determining the sealing action of the profiled body 15 as a whole.<br>
Fig. 5 illustrates a selection of other preferred cross-sectional shapes of profiled bodies 15, which enable an efficient sealing action to be achieved. Shapes are chosen which selectively incorporate seal segments 18 and transition regions 17 to the profiled base body 16 as well as others whereby seal segments 18 can be omitted depending on the application for which the profiled body 15 will be used. Depending on the specific application and the desired sealing effect, the profiled body 15 may be provided with strengthening elements 21 within the scope of the invention.<br>
As a result of the seal elements provided in the form of profiled bodies proposed by the invention, the most appropriate seal element can be selected in each case<br>
