APPARATUS  AND METHOD FOR FACILITATING THE TRANSMISSION  OF VAPOUR PART1CLES DIRECTLY INTO A NASAL PASSAGE<br>
RELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an apparatus and method for facilitating the transmission of vapour particies directly into a nasal passage.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Aromatherapy is the use of essences of plante processed as essential oite for therapeutic benefits such as, for example, attaining faalance in a human body, enhancing the immunity System, preventing or minrmizing ftlnesses, calming nerves, enhancing attention spans, and so forth. It is incorrect to generalise aromatherapy to be sotely reliant on the sense of smell. This is because each essential oil has a unique combination of constituents which interact with the body. It is this interaction with the constituents that provides the beneficial efforts for the body.<br>
At the moment, common techniques used for aromatherapy are:<br>
•	Massaging of essential oil onto desired body part(s);<br>
•	Hot/Cold Compress: Application of a compress to the desired body part(s) with appropriate amounts of essential oils added to the compress maintained at a preferred temperature;<br>
•	Inhaling essential oils by vaporizing the oils using hot water in a basin or bowl;<br>
•	Inhaling essential oils by vaporizing the oils using aroma burners;<br>
•	Taking baths with drops of essential oils added to the water; and<br>
•	Direct inhalation from an absorbent materiai with drops of essential oils added.<br>
It is widely acknowledged that direct inhalation of essential oils is the best way of reaping the benefits of aromatherapy. Methods of vaporization mentioned above do not maximize the amount of essential oils being vaporized and, consequently,<br><br>
inhaled. There is signfficant wastage of essential oils when such methods are employed. As such, the amount of essential oils required must be increased, consequently increasing the cost incurred. Unfortunately, in order to make aromatherapy more economical, impure essential oils augmented with synthetic ingredients are used. Such pracöces are more often than not detrimental to health due to the inhaiation of synthetic substances.<br>
Furthermore, nasal inhaiation provides more rapkJ effecöveness as compared to digestive, oral Inhalation or dermal compress as the acöve ingredients are passed straight to the lungs where they are absorbed directly into the Wood stream.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
There is provided an apparatus for facilitating the transmtssion of vapour particles directly into a nasal passage, including: at ieast one structural member, and at least one absorbent member at each end of the at least one structural member for containing a liquid able to be evaporated to form the vapour particles. Preferably, there are at least two studs positioned at intermediate positions between the ends of the at least one structural member.<br>
Preferably, the at least one absorbent member is made from a material selected from: sponge, fabric, cotton, paper, wood, absorbent polymers and so forth. It is most preferable that the structural member is made from a material selected from: copper, aluminum, iron, steei, ductile polymers and so forth. The structural member may preferably be coated with a material selected from: PVC, Silicon, latex, vinyl, nitrile, synthetic potymer, and so forth.<br>
•<br>
It is preferable that the at least one absorbent member is located within a holder. The holder may preferably have a perforated disc in its inner rim. The holder may also.have a solid disc in its inner rim. The absorbent member may be in a shape selected from: dtsc-shaped, spherical-shaped, pyramid-shaped, polygonakshaped, hemispherical-shaped, and so forth. The absorbent member may be used to<br><br>
contain liquid seiected from: essential oils, or liquid medication. The liquid medication rnay be of the type typically introduced via nasal drops/sprays.<br>
There is also provided an apparatus for fadlitafing the transmission of vapour parücles direcöy into a nasal passage, induding: at teast one structural memben and at least one absorbent member enveloping the at least one structural member for containing a liquid able to be evaporated to form the vapour paröcles.<br>
There is aiso provided a method for the transmission of vapour paröcles dfcBctiy into a nasai passage usmg the aforementioned apparatus, and a method for the transmission of medication directly into a nasal passage using the aforementioned apparatus.<br>

The structural rnember 22 may have at ieast two studs 30 positioned at intermediate positions between the first 26 and second 28 ends of the structural rnember 22. The absorbent mernbers 50 may be formed from materials, such as, for exampie, sponge, fabric, cotton, paper, absorbent potymers and so forth; and in dlfferent shapes, such as, for exampie, spherical-shaped, pyramid-shaped, polygonal-shaped, hemispherical-shaped, and so farih. The absorbent mernbers 50 may be soaked wrth Bquid content such as, for exampie, essenfial oits, and liquid medication. The liquid medication may be typicaiy rrtroduced via nasal drops/sprays. The apparatus 20 is used in an identical manner as the preferred embodiment of the present fnvention.<br>
Refemng to Rgure 6, there is shown another alternative embodiment of the apparatus 20. The apparatus 20 may also indude a structural rnember 22 with nostrfl phjgs 52 located along a length of the structural rnember 22 from an intermediate position to the first end 26 and a second end 28 respectively. The structural rnember 22 may be made from materials such as, for exampie, copper, aluminum, iron, steel, ductile polymers and so forth. The structural rnember 22 may have at Ieast two studs 30 positioned at intermediate positions between the first 26 and second 28 ends of the structural rnember 22. Disc-like absorbent mernbers 34 may be rnserted into the nostril plugs 52. Plug 52 may have a disc (not shown) fitted in the inner rim 54 of the plug 52. The disc may be perforated to allow the passage of air orrt may be a solid disc. The disc-like absorbent rnember 34 may be placed into the plug 52. The absorbent rnember 34 may fit and conform to the inner rim 54 of the plug 52 and rest against the disc. The absorbent mernbers 34 may be formed from materials, such as, for exampie, sponge, fabric, cotton, paper, absorbent polymers and so forth. The absorbent mernbers 50 may be soaked with liquid content such as, for exampie, essential oils, and liquid medication. The liquid medication may be typically introduced via nasal drops/sprays. The apparatus 20 is used in an identical manner as the preferred embodiment of the present invention.. However, thrs embodiment of the apparatus 20 may be less readily accepted as the<br><br>
^1<br>
users' would have the appearance of flared nostrils, and may be uncomfortable to<br>
the user.<br>
Referring to Figure 7, there is shown yet another alternative emtxxfiment of the apparatus 20. Figure 7a shows the apparatus 20 being bent prior to being placed into the nostrils of a user. Figure 7b shows the apparatus 20 prior to being bent The apparatus 20 may have a structural member 22 envetoped by an absorbent member 56. The structural member 22 may be made from materiais such as, för example, copper, aluminum, iron, steel, ductfle polymers and so forth, The absorbent member 56 may be soaked with liquid content such as, for exampie, essentiai oils, and liquid medication. The liquid medicaüon may be typicaly introduced via nasal drops/sprays. The absorbent member 56 may have an adhestve side 58 and a non-adhesive side 60. The adhesive side 58 may be used to adhere the apparatus 20 to the central nasal bone. The apparatus 20 may be bent into a U-shape with each end in each nostril with the adhesive side 58 adhering to the central nasal bone for anchorage to the central nasal bone. The non-adhesive side 60 may be exposed for the drculation of arr on the absorbent member 56.<br>
Figure 8 shows the apparatus 20 when in use. A second end 28 of the structural member 22 is placed in one nostril 32 of a user 100 and the first end 26 of the structural member 22 is placed in the other nostril of the user 100. The structural member 22 may be bent by gripping studs at intermediate positions (not shown) between the first 26 and second 28 ends of the structural member 22. This aliows for various sizes and shapes of noses, and for various sizes and Separation of nostrils. The structural member 22 may be bent such that holder 24 does not cause discomfort to the user 100, and the apparatus 20 does not fall out from the nose of the user 100. Each holder 24 should have at least one absorbent member 34 soaked with liquid content such as, for example, essentiai oils, and liquid medication. The liquid medication may be typically introduced via nasal drops/sprays. When the apparatus 20 is placed in such a position, the normal breathing of the user 100 would allow for the transmission of vapour particles into a nasal passage. The apparatus 20 may also be used to reduce the effect of foul<br><br>
smells in environments such as, for exampie, in washrooms, wet markets, vehicle exhaust emissions, smoking areas, sewage areas, rubbish Clearing areas, and so forth. Due to the smail size of the apparatus 20, coupled wfth the eliminating of the buming of essential oils, or extemal devices, it can be used anywhere and at any time. Given that the transmission of vapour partides is directly into the nasal passage of the user 100, discomfort is minimized to people surrounding the user 100 with sensitive noses, and who dislike the smel of the 6qiid content in the absorbent members 34.<br>
Most essential oüs are anti-septic to some degree. Hence, when the apparafeis 20 is employed in the nostril 32 of the user 100, air may be cteansed befbre entering the nasal passage and, subsequenöy, the respiratory system.<br>
Apparatus 20 may also be used to introduce medication through inhalaöon. There may be a way to use the apparatus 20 to aid smokers trying to qurt smoking through the use of appropriate essential oils that may simuiate the effects of nicotine or nicotine itself.<br>
Figures 9 and 10 show a variant of the embodiment of Rgure 2. Here, the holder 24 has a top rim 92 through which the absorbent member 34 may pass. Each holder 24 also has an arcuate slot 90 extending around a part of the skJe wall of the holder 24, and through which the absorbent member 34 may also pass. There may be one or more slots 90 around the holder 24. Depending on the number and location of the slots, the absorbent member 34 may be passed into the holder 24 in the direction of one of the arrows a, b, c, or d.<br>
Whiist   there   has   been   described    in   the   foregoing   description   preferred embodiments of the present invention, it will be understood by those skilled in the • technology concemed that many variations or modifications may be made to details of design or construction wrthout departing from the present rnvention.<br>
