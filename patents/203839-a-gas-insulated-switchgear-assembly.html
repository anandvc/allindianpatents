				<td>Description<br>
Gas-insulated switchgear assembly having a three-phase busbar system<br>
The invention relates to a gas-insulated switchgear assembly having busbars for a three-phase busbar system, in particular for medium-voltage technology, and having a number of circuit breakers (which can be controlled via switch disconnectors), and panel or cable connections, corresponding to the number of poles to be switched.<br>
Gas-insulated switchgear assemblies of the type defined initially are known, inter alia, from the Company document from Siemens AG, "Mittelspannunqsanlaqen" [medium-voltage systems], Catalogue HA 35.11, pages 16,17 and 21. Both in single busbar systems and in double busbar systems, the busbars are in this case each arranged in separate gas areas which are located one behind the other and are themselves each connected to a further gas area, located underneath, for the respective switch disconnector and circuit breaker. Depending on the requirement, the switchgear assemblies are provided with circuit breakers for connection of panel or cable connections.<br>
Furthermore, a gas-insulated switchgear assembly ' is likewise known from DE 198 09 839 Al, which has gas-filled containers and in each of which a number of busbars are accommodated, together with their three-position switches, in a single container. The circuit breakers which are located underneath and are arranged, in the same way, with a number of them in a further container, are electrically conductively connected to the busbars via so-called gas-tight module coupling devices, with the number of module coupling devices depending on the number of poles to be connected. Switchgear assemblies having<br>
-2-<br>
a number of switch panels are designed with a modular structure, together with the module coupling devices. The object on which the invention is based is to considerably increase the extent of modularization for such gas-insulated switchgear assemblies, while at the same time reducing the required volume. In this case, one particular aim is to simplify the capability to expand the switchgear assembles, while restricting to a minimum  the  gas  work  when  replacing  individual functional elements.<br>
According to the invention, this is achieved by the following features,<br>
1.1  each busbar system is accommodated in a hermetically sealed busbar module within a busbar area of the switchgear assembly,<br>
1.2  the busbars are arranged horizontally in the busbar module and vertically in the outer area of it,<br>
1.3  the busbar module can be connected by means of screw couplings for panel expansion,<br>
1.4  each circuit breaker is accommodated in a circuit breaker module inside the switchgear assembly, and<br>
1.5  each busbar module is electrically conductively connected to the corresponding circuit breaker module by means of a module coupling.<br>
The compact, triangular arrangement of the busbars in the hermetically sealed busbar module reduces virtually to a minimum extent the space requxred for accommodation of the busbars in the common busbar area of the switchgear assembly. In comparison to known switchgear assemblies, the switch panel or panels is or are in this way considerably shortened, so that a correspondingly smaller physical volume is required. Furthermore, the effort required to replace the hermetically sealed busbar module in the event of a defect  is  considerably  simplified,  thus  noticeably<br>
- 3 -<br>
GR 2000 P 13914 WO<br>
reducing the time,<br>
duration of the interruption for the power supply and<br>
distribution.<br>
The  use  of  screw  couplings  allows  the  switchgear<br>
assemblies to be expanded in a simple manner, without<br>
any additional complexity, when required.<br>
In the case of the double busbar systems as claimed in patent  claim  2,  these" and  further  advantages  are evident to a greater extent in comparison to known switchgear  assemblies.  This  is  because  the  double busbar system itself is formed from two busbar modules, which  are  arranged  mirror-image  symmetrically  with respect to one another, are approximately of the same type, are likewise each hermetically sealed, and are arranged interleaved (?) inside the busbar area of the switchgear  assembly.  In  conjunction with  the  screw couplings, which can be used in a flexible manner, the use of the individual welded hermetically sealed busbar modules makes it possible to expand the switchgear assembly by the addition of additional switch panels, without having to take the switchgear assembly out of use.<br>
Furthermore, the interleaved arrangement of the busbar modules, which are otherwise arranged mirror-image symmetrically with respect to one another, allows the drive kinematics of the three-positioned switches, which are functionally linked to the busbars, for both busbar modules to be equipped in an identical manner, and to be operated from the front face of the switchgear assembly.<br>
With the same arrangement of the busbar modules, the circuit breaker module for longitudinal couplings in single busbar systems can also be used for longitudinal and transverse coupling springs for double busbar systems. This results in a considerable reduction in the number of assembly variants, furthermore resulting<br>
- 4 -<br>
GR 2000 P 13914 WO<br>
in economic, cost-effective production.<br>
The invention will be explained in more detail using an<br>
exemplary  embodiment,  which  is  illustrated  in  the<br>
figures, in which:<br>
Figure 1 shows a side view of the gas-insulated switchgear assembly with those components which are essential to the invention, and<br>
Figure 2  shows a front view of the same system<br>
The side view in Figure 1 shows the gas-insulated switchgear assembly with a three-phase double busbar -system which, in the common busbar area SR, is equipped with the busbar modules SM1 and SM2, which are opposite one another with mirror-image symmetry and are arranged interleaved. This illustration shows, particularly clearly, that the space requirement for the busbars, which are not annotated, within the busbar modules in the busbar area SR is very small.<br>
In that the switch disconnectors TS..., which are generally in the form of three-position switches and are controlled by the disconnector drive TA associated with them all, are accommodated in a known manner in the common busbar area SR, which is sealed in a gas-tight manner of the top of the busbar cover SA. The circuit breaker modules LS. . . are provided in the circuit breaker area LR, which is immediately adjacent underneath, and they are electrically conductively connected to the corresponding switch disconnectors TS... by means of the module couplings MK... associated with the poles.<br>
The figure furthermore indicates that the outputs of the circuit breaker modules LS... are passed via the corresponding cable connection KA into the cable connection area KR, from where the panel and/or cable connections, which are not illustrated, are installed.<br>
- 5 -<br>
GR 2000 P 13914 WO<br>
Figure 2, which shows an approximately transparent front view of the switchgear assembly, illustrates in particular the busbars SM1 and SM2 which, if required, can be connected at the side by means of the screw couplings SK... for panel expansion to the first and second busbars SS1,2. Furthermore, the functional breakdown of the switchgear assembly into the busbar area SR, circuit breaker LR and cable connection area KR is shown in particular, and the parallel electrical connection of the two busbar modules SM1,2 to the single associated circuit breaker module LS... for the double busbar system by means of the module couplings MK... can be seen.<br>
