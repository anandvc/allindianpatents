PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention,  and the manner in which it is  to be  performed : -<br><br><br>
ENGLISH TRANSLATION VERIFICATION<br>
CERTIFICATE u/r. 20(3)(b)<br>
I, Mr. HIRAL CHANDRAKANT JOSHI, an authorized agent for the applicant, OERLIKON TEXTILE GMBH &amp; CO. KG do hereby verify that the content of English translation of certified German Priority claiming 10 2007 028 650.5 dated June 21st 2007 thereof is correct and complete.<br>
HIRAL CHANDRAKANT JOSHI AGENT FOR OERLIKON TEXTILE GMBH &amp; CO. KG<br><br>
The invention relates to a device with the features of the preamble of claim 1.<br>
It has been known for a long time, in particular for automatic winding machines, within closed transporting circuits, to transport the cops being used as the delivery bobbin and produced in a ring spinning machine, as well as empty tubes or also partially wound tubes, by means of transporting plates. The cops or tubes are in the process placed upright on arbours of these transporting plates. The transporting plates stand with their base plate, substantially during the entire transportation, on moved transporting belts, which entrain them by frictional engagement. The closed transporting circuits have a plurality of transporting loops, which either lead into the individual winding heads or to specific treatment devices. Cop preparation mechanisms, tube clearing mechanisms, creeling mechanisms etc. should be mentioned, for example, as treatment devices. For example, as a function of the winding state of the respective tube, the transporting plate carrying it is branched off to a tube removal mechanism and a cop loading mechanism, a tube clearing mechanism or directly to a preparation mechanism.<br>
Lever-like .deflectors are generally arranged at the branch-offs and block one of the two paths for the transporting plates. As a result, the transporting plate is deflected into the remaining path where it is taken over by frictional engagement by the transporting belt which runs there (for example see DE 34 34 576 C2). This branch-off form meets problems when the throughput of the transporting plates is very high and this is the case, in particular, at main transporting sections of long winding machines. The take over by means of frictional engagement does not always take place with the speed required, so hold-ups and even jams may occur in the distribution of the transporting plates between the transporting plates and the fixed guide means or the deflector itself during the adjustment movement thereof. This problem can be improved slightly by additional advanced controlled stoppers. However, this is no remedy for the throughput.<br>
-2-<br><br>
To avoid intervention into the transporting path by means of deflectors, also proposed according to the prior art, such as, for example, by DE 40 11 797 C2, are switchable electromagnets, which deflect the base plates of the transporting plates provided with a ferromagnetic ring at branch-offs, from their straight transporting path into a transporting path that branches off.<br>
These known mechanism thus have the common drawback that in the case of a transporting deflector a jam and. therefore back pressure may occur or the positive running of the desired branching off of the transporting plates in the case of an electromagnetic deflector is not high enough to provide absolute functional reliability, so tracking of the transporting plates by means of additional sensors may become necessary.<br>
It is furthermore known from DE 33 08 171 C2 to make part of the transporting path itself, that transports the transporting plates by frictional engagement, pivotable and to selectively connect it to various transporting sections located downstream. A clocked supply the transporting plates to this pivotable transporting section is also essential here as before the supply of a new transporting plate to this pivotable transporting path, the complete transfer of the previous transporting plate to the subsequent transporting sections has to be completed. The transfer itself i$ again time-critical due to the frictional transfer into the new transporting section.<br>
It is known, for example, from DE 42 17 307 Al, to provide a transporting disc in the region of a cop preparation mechanism, by means of which transporting disc the transporting plates carrying the cops can be supplied stepwise to the individual preparation stations.<br>
It is known from EP 1 110 898 A2, to forcibly supply transporting plates to a cop delivery mechanism by means of a transporting disc, which has recesses. Clocking adapted to the mode of operation of the cop delivery. device is also carried out by means of this.<br>
-,3-<br><br>
The object of the invention is to provide a distribution mechanism, which has high functional reliability at a high operating speed.<br>
This object is achieved according to the invention by the characterising features of claim 1.<br>
Developments are described in the dependent claims 2 to 5.<br>
The distribution mechanism according to the invention, by means of a guide element, which is firstly arranged at the end of a first transporting path, grasps a transporting plate transported thereto in order to then forcibly positively supply it, in other words actively by means of the guide element, to one of two emanating transporting paths. As the distribution mechanism thus transports the transporting plate into the new transporting path, without a transporting means of the new transporting section being necessary for the removal, a very short clock time, a reliable transfer and the avoidance of jams are the result. The supply depends with regard to its speed only on the transporting speed of the distribution mechanism.<br>
The direction of rotation of the distribution mechanism is determined by a control mechanism, which has a connection to the drive of the distribution mechanism. An arrangement of this type is, for example, arranged following a remaining cop recognition mechanism. If an empty tube is recognised by the remaining cop recognition mechanism, this transporting carrier, which carries the empty tube, is transported in the' direction of a tube removal mechanism and then transported onward to a cop loading mechanism. However, if the remaining cop recognition mechanism recognises that thread remnants are still present, the transporting plate with the remaining cop is supplied to a tube clearing mechanism. Alternatively, there may also be a supply to a cop preparation mechanism if the thread remnant is still adequately large. For this   purpose, however, a further device according to the invention located downstream, which is activated by the same remaining cop recognition mechanism, could also be positioned.<br>
-4-<br><br>
Advantageously, the distribution mechanism consists of a transporting disc with pocket-like recesses arranged at the same, angular spacings. These recesses form the guide elements. A transporting plate arriving on the first transporting path is conveyed into the recess by the conveying mechanism of this transporting path to then be entrained by the rotating transporting disc. The lateral limitation of the recess pushes the transporting plate completely into the proper transporting path.<br>
As the distribution mechanism transports transporting plates in the two directions to satisfy its distribution function, the recesses advantageously have a symmetrical shape.<br>
The transporting plates are generally guided along their transporting paths on a stand arranged between their base plate and an arbour. At this height, the distribution mechanism or transport disc also advantageously engages on the transporting plates.<br>
The transporting disc advantageously has, between the guide elements, a stop edge for transporting plates following on the first transporting path to stop a transporting plate which has already been transported up. As a result, an additional stop or separating mechanism can be dispensed with. If the stop edge has a radial spacing which remains substantially constant with respect to the pivot point of the transporting disc, the waiting transporting plate remains standing in its waiting position until a new recess is opened due to the rotation of the transporting disc. This may be significant, in particular, if a plurality of transporting plates are stacked up, which then also.remain in their rest position. Consequently, the required torque of the transporting disc can be sensibly limited.<br>
The invention will be described in more detail below with the aid of an embodiment. The figure shows a cutout of a transporting section of an automatic winding machine, which contains a branch-off, which follows a remaining cop recognition mechanism.<br>
-5-   <br><br>
Transporting plates 1, which have a base plate 2, a stand 3 and an arbour 4, are transported in various transporting loops in a winding machine of this type. The transporting paths of these transporting plates are also limited by guide plates 8, 9 and 10 in the region of the branch-off shown. The guide plates are arranged at a height such that they can in each case guide the stand 3 of the transporting plates T with their edges. The base plates 2 of the transporting plates 1 stand along the transporting paths 5, 6 and 7 on transporting belts running in the direction of the arrows shown with their upper run. Transporting plates 1, which have been rejected from the respective winding mechanisms, not shown, arrive on the transporting path 5. They carry empty tubes, remaining cops or full cops, also not shown here. In the event of complete unwinding, this involves an empty tube. If the cop has not been complete unwound, as, for example, it was no longer possible to grasp the beginning of the thread after a thread break at the winding head, this involves a remaining cop. Likewise, due to faulty preparation, the thread start may not have been grasped right at the beginning, so a full cop arrives at the remaining cop recognition mechanism 17.<br>
The remaining cop recognition mechanism 17 may be a mechanical mechanism, with which, for example, a rake-like sensor brushes over the tube surface and is held up due to a residual winding on its path. This is then used as a signal that the tube is not empty. There are also the most varied optical mechanisms to determine thread remnants on the tube. These are not to be further described here as they are not the subject of the invention.<br>
The remaining cop recognition mechanism 17 is connected via a line 17' to a control mechanism 16. This control mechanism 16 in turn controls the motor 15, which drives the transporting disc 11 by means of a shaft 12.<br>
If the remaining cop recognition mechanism 17 recognises an empty tube, a command goes via the line 17' to the control mechanism 16 to activate the motor in such a way that the transporting disc 11 rotates clockwise through 90°.<br>
-6-<br><br>
However, as can be seen in the present case, two further transporting plates are also present between the remaining cop recognition mechanism 17 and the transporting plate 1 arranged in a recess 13. The information regarding the direction of rotation can then always be allocated to the cop respectively arranged in the recess 13, for example, by means of a slide register.<br>
As can be seen from the view of the figure, in the design of the transporting elements shown, no additional stop mechanism is required. However, the movement sequences should be matched to one another in such a way that the remaining cop recognition mechanism has to have ended the tube control before the transporting disc 11 starts. With the start of the transporting disc 11, the transporting plate 1 following the transporting plate 1 transported in the recess 13 migrates with its stand 3 against the stop edge 14 of the transporting disc 11 where it remains until it can enter the next free recess 13. Once it has run into the next recess 13, the next but one transporting plate 1 is stopped in the position shown. It thus forms the stopper for the next transporting plate 1. Once this has arrived, the remaining cop recognition mechanism. 17 starts the scanning of the tube positioned in front of it if a sensor, not shown, has recognised the arrival/presence of a transporting plate 1 or a tube arranged thereon in front of the remaining cop recognition mechanism 17, and on ending of the scanning, signals the clearance to switch the transporting disc 11 onward. Alternatively, it would be conceivable for the remaining cop recognition mechanism 17 to have its own stopper so the clocking of the remaining cop recognition mechanism 17 would be completely independent of the clocking of the transporting disc 11.<br>
If the first transporting plate 1 positioned in the first transporting section 5 is a transporting plate 1 with an empty tube, the transporting disc is rotated clockwise, so this transporting plate 1 with the empty tube can be supplied on the transporting path 7 to a tube removal mechanism and later to a cop loading mechanism. On the other hand, if the transporting plate positioned in the recess 13 carries a tube with a more or less large thread remnant, the transporting disc 11<br>
-7-<br><br>
is rotated anticlockwise, so the transporting plate 1 arrives in the transporting path 6, on which a tube clearing mechanism or a cop preparation mechanism is then arranged.<br>
In the rest position shown of the transporting disc 11 it can be seen that the guide elements 13 remaining at the output-side transporting paths 6 and 7, are completely immersed under the guide plate 10. This means that the forced guiding by the entrainers 13 has gone so far that even if by means of the transporting means in the output-side paths 6 and 7, onward transportation of the respective transporting plate does not take place, for example in the event of a brief stoppage of the transporting belt, the distribution mechanism can be further operated even in the opposite direction. However, even if the entrainers 13 were not completely immersed under the guide plate 10, forced guidance would be provided to such an extent that a reliable transfer is ensured by the transporting means of the output-side transporting path.<br>
The exemplary branch-off described can be positioned at the most varied points of the transporting circuit for the transporting plates 1, at which, according to predeterminable criteria, a branch-off into different transporting paths is required. The reliability and the high transporting speed of this mechanism are seriously advantageous.<br>
