				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to new methods for the preparation of metallocene<br>
catalyst components based on carbon-bridged cyclopentadienyl-fluorenyl ligands.<br>
It is possible to develop catalyst systems that are able to produce different types of<br>
polymer such as isotactic, syndiotactic or atactic. It is however desirable that the<br>
selected catalyst produces predominantly an isotactic or syndiotactic polymer with<br>
very little atactic polymer. C2- or C1-symmetric metallocene catalysts are known to<br>
produce isotactic polyolefins. For example, C2 symmetric bis-indenyl type<br>
zirconocenes can produce high molecular weight high melting temperature isotactic<br>
polypropylene. The preparation of this metallocene catalyst is however costly and<br>
time-consuming. Most importantly, the final catalyst consists of a mixture of racemic<br>
and meso isomers in an often unfavourable ratio. The meso stereoisomer has to be<br>
separated to avoid the formation of atactic polypropylene during the polymerisation<br>
reaction.<br>
EP-A-0426644 relates to syndiotactic copolymers of olefins such as propylene<br>
obtainable using as a catalyst component isopropyl (fluorenyl)(cyciopentadienyl)<br>
zirconium dichloride. Syndiotacticity, as measured by the amount of syndiotactic<br>
pentads, rrrr was found to be 73-80%.<br>
EP 747406 relates to the polymerisation of an olefin monomer to form a<br>
syndiotactic/isotactic block polyolefin, particularly a block polypropylene. A<br>
component of the polymerisation catalyst was a 3-trimethyisily! cyclopentadienyl-9-<br>
fluorenyl zirconium or hafnium dichloride having an isopropylidene or<br>
diphenylmethylidene bridge.<br><br>
EP-A-577581 discloses the production of syndiotacfic poiypfopylenes using<br>
metaiiocene catalysts having fiuorenyl groups substituted in positions 2 and 7 and an<br>
unsubstituted cyclopentadienyl ring,<br>
EP-A-0419677 describes the production of syndiotactic polypropylene with an object<br>
to produce resin compositions having high stiffness when moulded. Metallcene<br>
catalysts such as isopropyl(cyclopentadienyl-1-fiuorenyl) zirconium dichloride were<br>
used in the production of the polypropylene. However the molecular weight, melting<br>
point and syndiolacticity of these products were relatively low.<br>
There is a need to develop new catalyst systems capable to provide polymers with<br>
improved properties and efficient methods for preparing them.<br>
It is an aim of the present invention to provide catalyst systems for the preparation of<br>
polymers having high molecular weight<br>
it is also an aim of the present invention to prepare polymers having a high melting<br>
temperature.<br>
it is another aim of the present invention to prepare impact copolymers having<br>
improved impact properties.<br>
It is a further aim of the present invention to prepare the catalyst systems capable to<br>
provide these improved polymers.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for preparing a catalyst<br>
component of general formula<br>
Ra2C (3,6-Rb2-Flu) (2-Rc-4-Rd-C5H2) MQ2<br><br>
wherein Ra2C is a mono-carbon bridge and wherein either both Ra arehydrogen or one Ra<br>
is hydrogen and the other Ra is phenyl groups with or without substituents, such as herein <br>
described, or both Ra are phenyl groups with substituents, such as herein described, <br>
wherein Rb, Rc and Rd are each independently selected from H or alky having from 1 to<br>
12 carbon atoms or aryl groups with or without substituents, such as herein described,<br>
with the restriction that they are not all simultaneously hydrogen,<br>
wherein M is a metal from Group 4 of the Periodic Table and<br>
wherein Q is halogen or alkyl having from 1 to 12 carbon atoms, and<br>
with the restriction that<br>
when Rc is alkyl group and one Ra is unsubstituted phenyl group, the other Ra is<br>
hydrogen,<br>
when Rc is alkyl group and one Ra is substituted phenyl group, the other Ra may be<br>
hydrogen or the same or another substituted phenyl group and the substituents are<br>
electron withdrawing groups, such as herein described,<br>
that when Rc is hydrogen, each Ra is independently selected form H or, with or without<br>
substituents, such as herein described, phenyl group,<br>
said process comprising:<br>
a) reaction by nucleophilic addition, in a solvent, of the group (Ra2C-2-Rc-4- Rd -fulvene)<br>
with the group [3,6-Rb2-Flu]- [M]+;<br>
b)	hydrolysis and separation of the resulting ligand;<br>
c)	deprotonation of the Iigand of step b) with R'M" to prepare a di-anion iigand, wherein<br>
R' is an alkyl having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms and wherein M" is Li, Na or K;<br>
d)	salt metathesis reaction in a solvent of the di-anion Iigand of step c) with MQ4;<br>
e)	isolation of the catalyst component.<br>
In a preferred embodiment according to the present invention in the bridge Ra2C,<br>
one Ra is unsubstituted phenyl and the other Ra is H.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, both Ra in the bridge are substituted phenyl<br>
groups. The substituents on the phenyl groups preferably are electron withdrawing<br>
groups that can be selected from halogen, more preferably F or CI, or from CX3<br>
wherein X is a halogen, more preferably F, preferably F or from NO2. The<br>
substituents on the phenyl groups can be located at position 4 in the case of a single<br><br>
substituent, or at positions 3 and 5 for 2 if there are 2 substituents. Preferably both<br>
phenyls have the same substitution pattern. Possible substituents to the "aryl groups"<br>
are "halogen or CX3", wherein X is halogenf or C1-C6 alkyl.<br>
Throughout this description, the positions are labelled as represented below.<br><br>
Preferably, both Rb are the same and are alkyl having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms,<br>
more preferably they both are tert-butyi.<br>
Preferably Rc is H or methyl.<br>

The solvent of steps a) and d) may be the same or different and are hydrocarbon,<br>
preferably selected from pentane, toluene, tetrahydrofuran (THF) or diethyl ether<br>
(Et2O). Preferably they are the same and it is H2O. Without Wishing to be bound by a<br>
theory, it is believed Et2O stabilises a transition state of the nucleophilic addition<br><br>
reaction including bulky constrained reagents. The reaction of step a) is carried out<br>
at a temperature of from 0 to 60 °C, preferably at room temperature for a period of<br>
time of from 6 to 24 hours, preferably of about 12 hours.<br>
Any activating agent having an ionising action known in the art may be used for<br>
activating the metallocene component- For example, it can be selected from<br>
aluminium-containing or boron-containing compounds. The aluminium-containing<br>
compounds comprise aluminoxane, alkyl aluminium and/or Lewis acid.<br>

wherein n is 1-40, preferably 10-20, m is 3-40, preferably 3-20 and R is a C1-C8 alkyl<br>
group and preferably methyl.<br>
Suitable boron-containing activating agents that can be used comprise a<br>
triphenylcarbenium boronate such as tetrakis-pentafluorophenyl-borato-<br>
triphenylcarbenium as described in EP-A-0427696, or those of the general formula<br><br>
[L'-H] + [B Ar1 Ar2 X3 X4]- as described in EP-A-0277004 (page 6, line 30 to page 7,<br>
line 7).<br>
The catalyst system can also be supported. The support if present can be a porous<br>
mineral oxide, advantageously selected from silica, alumina and mixtures thereof.<br>
Preferably it is silica.<br>
Alternatively, an activating support can be used.<br>
The catalyst system of the present invention can be used in the polymerisation of<br>
ethylene and alpha-olefins. It is preferably used to prepare highly isotactic propylene<br>
homopolymers having a high weight average molecular weight of at least 500 kDa,<br>
preferably at least 700 kDa, a high melting temperature of more than 150 °C,<br>
preferably Of more than 160 °C, and an mmmm of more than 95.<br>
It can also be used to prepare ethylene-propylene rubber (EPR) having an ethylene<br>
content of from 8 to 15 wt%, a high weight average moiecuiar weight of at least 500<br>
kDa, preferably at least 700 kDa, and a melt flow index MFI of from 2 to 10 dg/min.<br>
The melt flow index is measured following the method of standard test ASTM D 1238<br>
under a load of 2.16 kg and at a temperature of 230 oC. The EPR obtained in the<br>
present invention is characterised by excellent impact properties. It can be used in<br>
all applications that require elastomers with excellent thermoplastic properties.<br>

Schlenk techniques or in a glovebox. Solvents were distilled from Na/benzophenone<br>
(tetrahydrofuran (THF), diethyl ether (Et2O)) and Na/K alloy (toluene, pentane) under<br>
nitrogen, they were thoroughly degassed and stored under nitrogen. Deuterated<br>
solvents (benzene-d6, toluene-d8, THF-d8; &gt;99.5% D, Deutero GmbH) were vacuum-<br>
transferred from Na/K alloy into storage tubes. Chloroform-d1 and CD2CI2 were kept<br>
