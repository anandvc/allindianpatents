				<td>The invention relates to a data processing apparatus/for data processing an<br>
audio signal, to a data processing method, a transmitter comprising the data processing<br>
apparatus, a transmitter in the form of a recording apparatus, a record carrier, to second data<br>
processing apparatus for reconverting an input signal into a replica of the audio signal, to a receiver comprising the second data processing apparatus, to a receiver in the form of a<br>
reproducing apparatus and to a transmission signal comprising a data compressed residual<br>
bitstream signal.<br>
Data processing an audio signal is well known in the art. Reference is<br>
made in this respect to EP-A 402,973, document D1 in the list of related documents. The<br>
document describes a subband coder, in which an audio signal is A/D converted with a<br>
specific sampling frequency, such as 44.1 kHz, and the resulting samples in the form of eg.<br>
24 bits wide words of the audio signal, are supplied to a subband splitter filter. The subband<br>
splitter filter splits the wideband digital audio signal into a plurality of relatively narrow band<br>
subband signals. Using a psycho acoustic model, a masked threshold is derived and blocks of<br>
samples of the subband signals are subsequently quantised with a specific number of bits per sample for each block of the subband signals, in response to said masked threshold, resulting<br>
in a significant data compression of the audio signal to be transmitted. The data compression<br>
carried out is based on "throwing away" those components in the audio signal that are<br>
inaudible and is thus a lossy compression method. The data compression described in<br>
document D1 is a rather intelligent data compression method and requires a substantial<br>
number of gates or instructions, when realized in hard or software respectively, so that it is<br>
expensive. Moreover, the subsequent expansion apparatus also requires a substantial number<br>
of gates or instructions, when realized in hardware or software respectively.<br>
The invention aims at providing a data processing apparatus for<br>
processing an audio signal such that it can be data compressed by a lossless coder in a<br>
relatively simple way. Further, the invention aims at providing a corresponding data<br>
processing apparatus for reconverting the processed bitstream signal into a replica of the<br>
audio signal.<br>
The data processing apparatus in accordance with the invention comprises<br>
input means for receiving the audio signal,<br>
conversion means for carrying out a conversion on the audio signal so as to<br>
obtain a 1-bit bitstream signal, the conversion means comprising sigma-delta<br>
modulator means,<br>
prediction means for carrying out a prediction step on a signal so as to obtain a<br>
predicted bitstream signal,<br>
signal combination means for combining the bitstream signal and the predicted<br>
bitstream signal so as to obtain a residual bitstream signal, and<br>
output means for supplying the residual bitstream signal.<br>
The invention is based on the following recognition. Bitstream signals take up a considerable amount of capacity. To illustrate this: in a current proposal for a new<br>
standard for an optical audio disk, the disk will contain two channels of bitstream converted<br>
audio signals, sampled at 64.fs, where fs= 44.1 kHz. This corresponds to a rate four times<br>
higher than a current CD audio disk. As discussed in an earlier filed but not yet published<br>
patent application no. 96202807.2 in the name of applicant, document D7 in the list of<br>
related documents that can be found at the end of this description, already low complexity<br>
lossless coding algorithms, such as fixed Huffman table coding, are able to reduce this<br>
capacity to a certain extent. Experiments have revealed that even higher lossless compression<br>
ratios can be obtained using more sophisticated, more complex algorithms, such as Lempel-<br>
Ziv.<br>
Mainly in audio/speech coding, linear prediction is known to be a<br>
powerful technique. By removing redundancy from a speech/audio signal prior to<br>
quantization, the entropy of signal after quantization can be significantly reduced. The signals<br>
at the input and output of a predictor are either in a floating point or a multi bit<br>
representation.<br>
In lossless coding of bitstream signals, the complexity of the algorithm,<br>
especially at the decoder side is of importance. However, generally, the performance of the<br>
lossless coding algorithm is closely related to its complexity.<br>
In accordance with the invention, prediction is used on bitstream signals,<br>
ie. signals with only two different representation symbols, either "0" or "1". This has the<br>
advantage of an increase of lossless compression performance, for only a marginal extra<br>
complexity.<br>
Experiments have revealed that already a third order prediction has<br>
considerable effect on the statistics of the resulting signal. By means of prediction, as a<br>
preprocessing step, prior to data compression, the probability of a "1"-bit can be brought<br>
down from 50 % to about 20 %. The effect of this is that the output of the apparatus in<br>
accordance with the invention contains long runs of "zeroes", which can be exploited by<br>
simple Huffman coding or run-length coding.<br>
The audio signal can be applied in analog form or in digital form. When A/D<br>
converting, in accordance with the invention, an analog audio signal with a 1-bit A/D<br>
converter (also named: bitstream converter or sigma-delta modulator), the audio signal to be<br>
A/D converted is sampled with a frequency which is generally a multiplicity of the frequency<br>
of 44.1 kHz or 48 kHz. The output signal of the 1-bit A/D converter is a binary signal,<br>
named bitstream signal. When the audio signal is supplied in digital form, sampled at eg.<br>
44.1 kHz, the samples being expressed in eg. 16 bits per sample, this digital audio signal is<br>
oversampled with a frequency which is again a multiplicity of this sampling frequency of<br>
44.1 kHz (or 48 kHz), which results in the 1-bit bitstream signal.<br>
Converting an audio signal into a 1-bit bitstream signal has a number of<br>
advantages. Bitstream conversion is a high quality encoding method, with the possibility of a<br>
high quality decoding or a low quality decoding with the further advantage of a simpler<br>
decoding circuit. Reference is made in this respect to the publications "A digital decimating<br>
filter for analog-to-digital conversion of hi-fi audio signals", by J.J. van der Kam, document<br>
D2 in the list of related documents, and "A higher order topology for interpolative<br>
modulators for oversampling A/D converters", by Kirk C.H. Chao et al, document D3 in the<br>
list of related documents.<br>
1-bit D/A converters are used in CD players, as an example, to reconvert<br>
the bitstream audio signal into an analog audio signal. The audio signal recorded on a CD<br>
disk is however not data compressed, prior to recording on the disk.<br>
It is well known in the art that the resulting bitstream signal of the 1-bit<br>
A/D converter is, roughly said, a random signal which has a "noisy-like" frequency<br>
spectrum. Such types of signals are hard to data compress.<br>
Surprisingly, however, it was established that applying a prediction step,<br>
prior to data compression, eg. using a lossless coder, a significant data reduction could be<br>
obtained, in spite of the noisy character of the bitstream signal from the 1-bit A/D converter<br>

Figure 1 shows an embodiment of the data processing apparatus in<br>
accordance with the invention, comprising an input terminal 1 for receiving the audio signal.<br>
In the present example, the audio signal is an analog audio signal. The input terminal 1 is<br>
coupled to an input 2 of a 1-bit A/D converter 4, also called: sigma-delta modulator. An<br>
output 6 of the 1-bit A/D converter 4 is coupled to an input 8 of a prediction unit 10 as well<br>
as to a first input 40 of a signal combination unit 42. An output 12 of the prediction unit 10<br>
is coupled to a second input 44 of the signal combination unit 42, an output 48 of which is<br>
coupled to an output terminal 14.<br>
The 1-bit A/D converter 4 is adapted to carry out a 1-bit A/D conversion<br>
on the audio signal so as to obtain a bitstream signal which is supplied to the output 6. To<br>
that purpose, the A/D converter 4 receives a sampling frequency equal to N.fs via an input<br>
16. fs is a frequency equal to eg. 32 kHz, 44.1 kHz or 48 kHz and N is a large number,<br>
such as 64. The audio signal is sampled in the A/D converter 4 with a sampling frequency of<br>
eg. 2.8224 MHz (64 x 44.1 kHz). The bitstream signal appearing at the output 6 of the A/D<br>
converter thus has a bitrate of 2.8224 MHz.<br>
The prediction means 10 are adapted to carry out a prediction step on the<br>
bitstream signal applied to its input 8 so as to obtain a predicted bitstream signal at its output<br>
12. The signal combination means 42 is adapted to combine the bitstream signal applied to<br>
its input 40 and the predicted bitstream signal applied to its input 44 so as to obtain a residue<br>
bitstream signal which is supplied to its output 14.<br>
Figure 17a shows a frequency spectrum of the bitstream signal present at<br>
the output 6 of the A.D converter 4, for an input signal in the form of a 5 kHz sinusoid,<br>
sampled with a sampling frequency of 2.8224 MHz. The spectrum thus shows frequencies<br>
between 0 Hz and 1.4 MHz. Figure 17b shows part of the spectrum shown in figure 17a,<br>
namely that part between 0 Hz and 100 kHz, so as to more clearly show the 5 kHz sinusoid<br>
comprised in the bitstream signal. Clearly visible is the noise-like character of the bitstream<br>
signal, especially in the higher frequency region, which seems to imply that carrying out a<br>
prediction step on the said signal, with a subsequent signal combination of the predicted<br>
version of the bitstream signal and the bitstream signal so as to obtain said residual signal<br>
will not result in a substantial amount decrease in entropy of the residual signal, such<br>
decrease of entropy of the residual signal, compared to the input signal of the prediction unit<br>
being the general aim of a prediction unit.<br>
Contrary to this, investigations have made clear that a significant decrease<br>
in entropy of the residual bitstream signal can be obtained by carrying out a prediction step,<br>
in spite of the noisy-like character of the bitstream signal.<br>
The prediction unit 10 can have any form, and could comprise a FIR filter<br>
or an IIR filter, where the coefficients of the filter are chosen (or derived) such, that the<br>
output signal of the prediction unit 10 is the predicted version of the bitstream signal.<br>
Another embodiment of the prediction unit 10 will be further explained with<br>
reference to figure 2 and 3. Figure 2 shows a part of the prediction unit 10, which comprises<br>
a three bit shift register 20 having an input coupled to the input 8 of the prediction unit 10.<br>
Upon the application of three clock pulses (not shown) to the shift register 20, three<br>
subsequent bits X1, X2, X3 of the bitstream signal applied to the input 8 are shifted into the shift<br>
register 20. A detector 22 present having an input 24 coupled to the input 8 of the<br>
prediction unit 10. The detector detects the bit value of the next bit x4 directly following the<br>
three subsequent bits xl, x2,x3 in the bitstream signal. Further, a counter 26 is present which<br>
counts the number of times that a "0" bit follows a specific three bit bit sequence xl, x2, x3<br>
and the number of times that a "1" bit follows that same specific three bit bit sequence. This<br>
is done for all the eight possible 3-bit bit sequences x1, x2, x3.<br>
Explained in a different way. Assume that the three bit sequence "100" is<br>
stored in the shift register 20 and that the detector 34-detects the next bit x4 to be "0". As a<br>
result, the number N4,0 in the column 28 is increased by one. Upon the next clock pulse<br>
applied to the shift register 20, the 3-bit word stored in the shift register 20 now equals<br>
"000". Assume that the next bit x4 now equals T. As a result, the number N0,1 in the<br>
column 30 is increased by one.<br>
This procedure is continued for a relatively large portion of the bitstream<br>
signal. When the portion of the bitstream signal has been processed in this way, the columns<br>
28 and 30-are filled with numbers Ni,0, Ni,1, which indicate the number of occurrences of a<br>
"O"-bit or T-bit respectively as the next bit following the i-th 3-bit sequence given in column<br>
32, where i runs from 0 to 7 in the present example.<br>
Next, a predicted binary value x4" is derived from the numbers in the<br>
columns 28 and 30 for each of the 3-bit sequences x1, x2, x3 in the column 32, by taking that<br>
binary value (either "0" or "1") that resulted in the highest of the count number Ni,0 and Ni,1<br>
for the i-th bit sequence in column 32. As an example, if N4,0 equals 78 and N4,1 equals<br>
532, the predicted bit x4" in response to the occurrence of the 3-bit bit sequence "100" is<br>
chosen equal to " 1". A conversion table can thus be derived comprising the columns 32 and<br>
34, so that for each of the eight possible 3-bit sequences stored in the shift register 20, a<br>
corresponding predicted bit x4" can be generated. In the situation where equal count values<br>
Ni,0 and Ni,1 have been derived for a three bit bitsequence i, one can choose one of the two<br>
binary values "0" or " 1" at random as the value for the predicted bit.<br>
It should be noted here, that two counters for each 3-bit bit combination<br>
are used to count the numbers of "zeroes" and "ones" following said 3-bit bit combination. In<br>
spite of this, one could use only one counter which is capable of counting up upon the<br>
occurrence of a "zero" bit following the 3-bit bit combination and counting down in response<br>
to the occurrence of a "one" bit following the 3-bit bit combination. If the count value at the<br>
end of the test procedure is higher than at the beginning of the test procedure, the predicted<br>
bit will be chosen "zero". If the count value appears to be lower than the count value at the<br>
beginning of the test procedure, the predicted bit will be chosen "one".<br>
If the signal to be processed is substantially time invariant, it may occur<br>
that, upon deriving a conversion table from a next portion of the bitstream signal, the same<br>
predicted values x4" will be obtained. In such case, it suffices to derive the conversion table<br>
once. For bitstream signals having varying properties, it may be required to each time derive<br>
the conversion table from a subsequent portion of the bitstream signal and to predict that<br>
portion of the bitstream using its own derived conversion table.<br>
Figure 3 shows a further elaborated version of the prediction unit 10<br>
together with the signal combination unit 42. The input 8 of the prediction unit 10 is coupled<br>
to a first input 40 of a signal combination unit 42. An output 46 of the conversion means<br>
26", which comprises the conversion table derived in the way explained above with reference<br>
to figure 2, is coupled to a second input 44 of the signal combination unit 42, an output 48<br>
of which is coupled to the output 14 of the data processing apparatus. The signal combination<br>
unit 42 can be in the form of an EXOR, but the combination unit 42 may be of a different<br>
construction, such as an EXNOR.<br>
In response to a 3-bit bit sequence x1, x2, x3 stored in the shift register 20,<br>
the conversion unit 26" supplies the bit x4" at its output 46. This bit x4" is a prediction of the<br>
bit x4 present at the inputs of the shift register 20 and the combination unit 42. The<br>
combination unit 42 combines the bits x4 and x4" so as to obtain a residual bit. Upon a<br>
subsequent clock signal (not shown) the bit x4 present at the input of the shift register 20 is<br>
shifted into the shift register 20, so that a new 3-bit bit sequence is stored in the shift register<br>
20. The conversion unit 26" generates a new prediction bit x4" in response to this new 3-bit<br>
bit sequence stored in the shift register 20. The signal combination unit 42 combines this new<br>
prediction bit x4" with the new bit x4 now present at the input 40 so as to obtain a new<br>
residual bit. In this way, a residual bitstream signal is obtained.<br>
Assume that the combination unit 42 is an EXOR, the residual signal has<br>
the following property. Assume that both the bits x4 and x4" are the same, that is, either "0"<br>
or "1". The residual bit supplied by the EXOR is "0". Assume now that the bits x4 and x4"<br>
are not equal to each other. As a result, a " 1" bit is generated as a residual bit by the EXOR<br>
42. The occurrence of the T bits in the residual signal are thus a measure for the errors<br>
between the predicted bitstream signal applied to the input 44 of the combination unit 42 and<br>
the bitstream signal applied to the input 40.<br>
Figure 4 shows an embodiment of a recording apparatus comprising the<br>
data processing apparatus shown in figure 1, which may include the prediction unit shown in<br>
figure 3. The recording apparatus further comprises a data compression unit 150 for data<br>
compressing the residual bitstream signal into a data compressed residual bitstream signal and<br>
a write unit 50 for writing the data compressed residual bitstream signal in a track on the<br>
record carrier 52. In the present example, the record carrier 52 is a magnetic record carrier,<br>
so that the write unit 50 comprises at least one magnetic head 54 for writing the residual<br>
bitstream signal in the record carrier 52. The record carrier may however be an optical<br>
record carrier, such as a CD disk or a DVD disk.<br>
Figure 5 shows an embodiment of a transmitter for transmitting an audio<br>
signal via a transmission medium TRM, comprising the data processing apparatus as shown<br>
in figure 1, which may include the prediction unit shown in figure 3. The transmitter again<br>
comprises the data compression unit 150 and further comprises a transmission unit 60 for<br>
applying the data compressed residual bitstream signal to the transmission medium TRM.<br>
The transmission unit 60 could comprise an antenna 62.<br>
Transmission via a transmission medium, such as a radio frequency link<br>
or a record carrier, generally requires an error correction encoding and a channel encoding<br>
carried out on the data compressed residual signal to be transmitted. Figure 6 shows such<br>
signal processing steps carried out on the data compressed residual signal for the recording<br>
arrangement of figure 4. The recording arrangement of figure 6 therefore comprise an error correction encoder 56, well known in the art, and a channel encoder 58, also well known in<br>
the art.<br>
It has been said above that, in some applications, it suffices to use a fixed<br>
conversion table to process the bitstream signal. Upon reconverting the residual bitstream<br>
signal into a replica of the original bitstream signal, also a fixed conversion table suffices. In<br>
an application where, for subsequent portions of the bitstream signal each time a<br>
corresponding conversion table needs to be determined, to generate the residual bitstream<br>
signal, it will be required to use the same conversion tables for the portions in question upon<br>
reconverting the residual bitstream signal into the replica of the original bitstream signal. In<br>
such situation, it may be required to transmit side information representative of the<br>
conversion tables used for the various subsequent portions together with the residual signal so<br>
as to enable the reconversion upon reception.<br>
As a further example, if it appears that it suffices to use only two<br>
conversion tables in the processing apparatus of figure 1, such side information could simply<br>
be a selection signal, selecting one of the two conversion tables. A corresponding<br>
reconversion apparatus could comprise the two conversion tables as well, and the selection<br>
signal could be used to select one of the two conversion tables so as to reconvert the residual<br>
bitstream signal into the replica of the original bitstream signal.<br>
It should however be noted that, when having derived a conversion table<br>
for a portion of the bitstream signal, it is not absolutely necessary to transmit side<br>
information corresponding to this conversion table to a reconverter apparatus. The<br>
reconverter apparatus may generate the conversion table by itself. The prediction unit in the<br>
reconversion apparatus will have a low prediction accuracy in the beginning, but will "learn"<br>
itself so as to obtain a prediction conversion table, which will be substantially identical to the<br>
conversion table used in the transmitter apparatus.<br>
Figure 7 shows a schematic embodiment of a second data processing<br>
apparatus in accordance with the invention, which is capable of reconverting the residual<br>
bitstream signal into the replica of the original bitstream signal. The apparatus has an input<br>
terminal 70 for receiving the residual bitstream signal, as supplied by the data processing<br>
apparatus of figure 1. The input terminal 70 is coupled to a first input 86 of a signal<br>
combination unit 88, which has an output 76 coupled to an input 72 of a prediction unit 74 as<br>
well as to an input 78 of a 1-bit D/A converter 80. An output 98 of the prediction unit 74 is<br>
coupled to a second input 101 of the signal combination unit 88. An output 82 of the D/A<br>
converter 80 is coupled to an output terminal 84.<br>
The apparatus of figure 7 receives the residual bitstream via its input 70,<br>
which is supplied to the input 86 of the signal combination unit 88. The signal combination<br>
unit 88 combines the residue bitstream signal received via its input 86 with a predicted<br>
bitstream signal received via its input 101 so as to obtain a reconverted bitstream signal, and<br>
to supply the reconverted bitstream signal to its output 76. The prediction unit 74 carries out<br>
a prediction step on the reconverted bitstream signal so as to obtain said predicted bitstream<br>
signal at its output 98. The D/A converter unit 80 carries out a D/A conversion on the<br>
reconverted bitstream signal so as to obtain the replica of the original audio signal, which is<br>
supplied to the output terminal 84.<br>
The prediction unit 74 can have any form, and could comprise a FIR filter or<br>
an IIR filter, where the coefficients of the filter are chosen (or derived) such, that the output<br>
signal of the prediction unit 74 is the predicted version of the bitstream signal.<br>
Another embodiment of the prediction unit 74 will be further explained with<br>
reference to figure 8. The input 72 of the prediction unit 74 is coupled to an input 92 of a<br>
three bit shift register 94. The three outputs of the three bit positions in the shift register 94<br>
are coupled to corresponding inputs of a conversion unit 96. The conversion unit 96<br>
comprise the conversion table discussed and explained above with reference to the figures 2<br>
and 3. An output 98 of the conversion unit 96 is coupled to a second input 101 of the signal<br>
combination unit 88. The signal combination unit 88 can be in the form of an EXOR, but the<br>
combination unit 88 may be of a different construction, such as an EXNOR. It will be clear<br>
that, if the signal combination unit 42 of figure 3 is an EXOR, the signal combination unit 88<br>
of figure 8 must be an EXOR as well, in order to regenerate a replica of the original<br>
bitstream signal.<br>
In response to a 3-bit bit sequence x1, x2, x3 stored in the shift register 94,<br>
the conversion unit 96 supplies the bit x4" at its output 98, in the way explained above with<br>
reference to the figures 2 and 3. This bit x4" is a prediction of the bit x4 that will be supplied<br>
upon the next clock pulse by the combination unit 88 and stored as the new bit x3 in the most<br>
right storage position of the shift register 94. The residual bit present at the input 86 of the<br>
combination unit 88 is combined with the predicted bit x4" so as to obtain the replica of the<br>
original bit x4 in the original bitstream signal. When the residual bit is "0", which meant that<br>
a correct prediction was carried out in the apparatus of figure 1 and 3, the combination of<br>
the residual bit with the predicted bit x4" results in the bitvalue of the bit x4" to appear at the<br>
output 76 of the combination unit 88. When the residual bit is "1", which meant that an<br>
incorrect prediction was carried out in the apparatus of figure 1 and 3, the combination of<br>
the residual bit with the predicted bit x4" results in the inverse bitvalue of the bit x4" to<br>
appear at the output 76 of the combination unit 88. In both cases, a correct replica of the bit<br>
x4 will appear at the output 76 of the combination unit 88.<br>
Upon a subsequent clock signal (not shown) the bit x4 present at the input<br>
of the shift register 94 is shifted into the shift register 94, so that a new 3-bit bit sequence is<br>
stored in the shift register 94. The conversion unit 96 generates a new prediction bit x4" in<br>
response to this new 3-bit bit sequence stored in the shift register 94. The signal combination<br>
unit 88 combines this new prediction bit x4" with the next residual bit in the residual<br>
bitstream signal applied to the input 86 so as to obtain a replica of the next bit x4 in the<br>
bitstream signal. In this way, the replica of the bitstream signal is obtained.<br>
Figure 9 shows the data processing apparatus of figure 7 incorporated in a<br>
reproduction apparatus. The reproducing apparatus further comprises a data expansion unit<br>
162 for data expanding the data compressed residual bitstream signal so as to obtain a replica<br>
of the original residual bitstream signal and a read unit 100 for reading the data compressed<br>
residual bitstream signal from a track on the record carrier 52. In the present example, the<br>
record carrier 52 is a magnetic record carrier, so that the read unit 100 comprises at least<br>
one magnetic head 102 for reading the data compressed residual bitstream signal from the<br>
record carrier 52. The record carrier may however be an optical record carrier, such as a<br>
CD disk or a DVD disk.<br>
Figure 10 shows an embodiment of a receiver for receiving an audio<br>
signal via a transmission medium TRM, comprising the data processing apparatus as shown<br>
in figure 7. The receiver further comprises the data expansion unit 162 and a receiving unit<br>
105 for receiving the data compressed residual bitstream signal from the transmission<br>
medium TRM. The receiving unit 105 could comprise an antenna 107.<br>
As has been explained above, transmission via a transmission medium,<br>
such as a radio frequency link or a record carrier, generally requires an error correction<br>
encoding and a channel encoding carried out on the data compressed residual signal to be<br>
transmitted, so that a corresponding channel decoding and error correction can be carried out<br>
upon reception. Figure 11 shows the signal processing steps of channel decoding and error<br>
correction carried out on the received signal, received by the reading means 100 for the<br>
reproducing arrangement of figure 9. The reproducing arrangement of figure 11 therefore<br>
comprise a channel decoder 110, well known in the art, and an error correction unit 112,<br>
also well known in the art, so as to obtain a replica of the data compressed residual bitstream<br>
signal.<br>
It has also been said above that, in some applications, it suffices to use a<br>
fixed conversion table to process the bitstream signal in the apparatus of the figures 1 and 3.<br>
Upon reconverting the residual bitstream signal into a replica of the original bitstream signal,<br>
also a fixed conversion table suffices, so that no side information needs to be transmitted to<br>
the processing apparatus of the figures 7 and 8. In an application where, for subsequent<br>
portions of the bitstream signal each time a corresponding conversion table needs to be<br>
determined in the apparatus of the figures 1 and 3, to generate the residual bitstream signal,<br>
it will be required to use the same conversion tables for the portions in question upon<br>
reconverting the residual bitstream signal into the replica of the original bitstream signal in<br>
the apparatus of the figures 7 and 8. In such situation, it will be required to transmit side<br>
information representative of the conversion tables used for the various subsequent portions<br>
together with the residual signal so as to enable the reconversion upon reception. As an<br>
example, this side information thus needs to be recorded on the record carrier 52, such as in<br>
the application where the apparatus of the figures 1 and 3 is accommodated in a recording<br>
apparatus and the apparatus of the figures 7 and 8 is incorporated in a reproducing apparatus<br>
of the figure 9 or 11, and be reproduced from said record carrier upon reproduction.<br>
If it appears that it suffices to use only two conversion tables in the<br>
processing apparatus of figure 1, such side information could simply be a selection signal,<br>
selecting one of the two conversion tables. A corresponding reconversion apparatus could<br>
comprise the two conversion tables as well, and the selection signal could be used to select<br>
one of the two conversion tables so as to reconvert the residual bitstream signal into the<br>
replica of the original bitstream signal.<br>
The embodiments described above are based on the prediction of 1 bit<br>
(x4") following a sequence of three subsequent bits (x1, x2, x3) in the bitstream signal. In<br>
general, the prediction unit can be capable of predicting from n subsequent bits in the<br>
bitstream signal m prediction bits, said m prediction bits being predicted versions of m<br>
subsequent bits in the bitstream signal following said n subsequent bits in the bitstream<br>
signal, where n and m are integers larger than zero.<br>
Figure 12 shows an example how to derive a conversion table which is<br>
capable of predicting one or two prediction bits from a sequence of four consecutive bits<br>
x1,x2,x3,x4 in the bitstream signal. Figure 12 shows a part of another prediction unit 10,<br>
which comprises a four bit shift register 20" having an input coupled to the input 8 of the<br>
prediction unit 10. Upon the application of four clock pulses (not shown) to the shift register<br>
20", four subsequent bits x1,x2,x3,x4 of the bitstream signal applied to the input 8 are shifted<br>
into the shift register 20". A detector 22" is present having an input 24 coupled to the input 8<br>
of the prediction unit 10. The detector 22" detects the bit value of the next two bits x5,x6<br>
directly following the four subsequent bits x1,x2,x3,x4 in the bitstream signal. Further, a<br>
counter 26" is present which counts the number of times that a "0" bit follows a specific four<br>
bit bit sequence x1,x2,x3,x4, the number of times that a "1" bit follows that same specific<br>
four bit bit sequence, the number of times that a two bit bitsequence "00" follows that same<br>
specific four bit bit sequence x1,x2,x3,x4, the number of times that a two bit bitsequence "01"<br>
follows that same specific four bit bit sequence, the number of times that a two bit<br>
bitsequence "10" follows that same specific four bit bit sequence x1,x2,x3,x4 and the number<br>
of times that a two bit bitsequence "11" follows that same specific four bit bit sequence. It<br>
should be noted here, that the 2-bit bit combination "b1,b2" will be expressed such that the<br>
first bit b1 is the bit x5, where the second bit b2 is the bit x6.<br>
Suppose that the detector 22" has detected that the two bits x5,x6 equal<br>
"01". As a result, the counter 26" increases the count value Ni,0 in the column 28" by one<br>
and the count value Ni,3 in the column 30" by one, where i runs from 0 to 15 and<br>
corresponds to the i-th four bit bitsequence given in the column 32" of the table in figure 12.<br>
Next, upon the application of a number of P clock pulses to the apparatus<br>
of figure 12, where P need not necessarily be equal to 2, but may be larger, another 4-bit<br>
bitsequence x1,x2,x3,x4 of the bitstream signal is stored in the shift register 20". The detector<br>
22" detects the bit values of the next two bits x5,x6 in the bitstream signal following the said<br>
4-bit bitsequence. Suppose, the next two bits equal "11". As a result, the counter 26"<br>
increases the count value Ni,1 in the column 29 by one and the count value Ni,5 in the<br>
column 31 by one, where i corresponds to the four bit bitsequence stored in the shift register<br>
20", which is assumed to be the i-th four bit bitsequence given in the column 32" of the table<br>
in figure 12.<br>
This procedure is repeated a plurality of times, so that for all the sixteen<br>
possible 4-bit bit sequences x1,x2,x3,x4 the count values Ni,0 to Ni,5 have been obtained. The<br>
count values Ni, n to Ni, 5 indicate the number of occurrences of the one bit and two bit<br>
bitsequences following the i-th 4-bit sequence given in column 32".<br>
Next, either a predicted binary value x5" or a predicted 2 bit binary<br>
sequence x5"x6" is derived, based upon the count values in the columns 28", 29, ... to 31, for<br>
each of the 4-bit sequences x1,x2,x3,x4 in the column 32.<br>
Suppose that the count value Ni,0 or the count value Ni,1 of the six count<br>
values Ni,0 to Ni,5 for the i-th 4 bit bitsequence in column 32" is substantially larger than all<br>
the others. In such situation, one can decide to choose the "0" bit or "1" bit, respectively, as<br>
the prediction bit x5". Suppose that Ni,0 and Ni,2 do not differ very much and are larger than<br>
the other four count values. In such situation, one could decide to choose the bit combination<br>
"00" as the prediction bits x5",x6" for the i-th bitsequence.                           In this way, the<br>
conversion table obtained can thus comprise a column 33 which may comprise either a one<br>
bit value as a prediction bit for predicting the bit following a specific 4-bit bit sequence in<br>
the bitstream signal, or a 2-bit binary word as a 2-bit prediction word for predicting the 2-bit<br>
word following another specific 4-bit bit sequence in the bitstream signal.<br>
Figure 13 shows schematically another embodiment of the data processing<br>
apparatus for data processing an audio signal, which comprises a conversion unit 130 in the<br>
form of a conversion table, such as the one explained with reference to figure 12. That<br>
means that the conversion table comprises the columns 32" and 33 given in figure 12, so that<br>
upon the receipt of a specific 4-bit bit sequence x1,x2,x3,x4, as given in column 32", a<br>
specific prediction bit x5 or two specific prediction bits x5,x6 will be generated at the output<br>
131 of the conversion unit 130.<br>
The functioning of the apparatus of figure 13 is as follows. In response to<br>
a specific 4-bit bitsequence stored in the shift register 20" the conversion unit 130 generates,<br>
as an example a one bit word, equal to T. This is the case when a 4-bit sequence "0000" is<br>
stored in the shift register 20". The column 33 shows that upon such 4-bit sequence, see<br>
column 32" in the table of figure 12, a T bit is predicted, see the column 33 in the table of<br>
figure 12. The predicted bit x5" is supplied to the input 44 of the combination unit 42 in<br>
which the predicted bit x5" is combined with the real bit x5 in the bitstream present at the<br>
input 40. Next, upon one clock pulse, generated by a central processing unit 132, the<br>
information in the shiftregister 20" is shifted one position to the left, so that the bit x5 is now<br>
stored in the most right storage location of the shift register 20". Suppose, this bit was indeed<br>
a "1" bit, as predicted.<br>
Next, the conversion unit converts the 4-bit sequence "0001" stored in the<br>
shift register 20" into a 2-bit word "01", see the columns 32" and 33 in the table of figure 12,<br>
which 2-bit word is supplied to the output 131. The central processing unit 132 now<br>
generates two clock pulses so that the 2-bit prediction word "01" can be combined in the<br>
combination unit 42 with the actual bits x5,x6 in the bitstream signal. The two clock pulses<br>
also result in a shift by two positions to the left in the shift register 20" so that the shift<br>
register has the values "0" and "1" stored in the positions in the shift register 20", indicated<br>
by x2 and x2, and the actual bits x5 and x6 mentioned above are now stored as the new bits<br>
x3 and x4 in the shift register 20". Thus, upon predicting one bit, the central processing unit<br>
132 generates one clock pulse, after which a subsequent prediction step is carried out,<br>
whereas, upon predicting a 2-bit word, the central processing unit 132 generates two clock<br>
pulses before a subsequent prediction step is carried out.<br>
Suppose that, for subsequent portions of the bitstream signal, a<br>
corresponding conversion table is derived first, eg. in the way explained above with<br>
reference to figure 12, it is desired to transmit the conversion table together with the residual<br>
bitstream signal so as to enable reconversion upon reception of the residual bitstream signal.<br>
Figure 13 shows a connection 135 between the prediction unit 26"" and the central<br>
processing unit 132. Via this connection, the conversion table derived in the way described<br>
with reference to figure 12 can be supplied to the central processing unit 132 and<br>
subsequently supplied to an output 137 for transmission together with the residual bitstream<br>
signal via the transmission medium<br>
Figure 14 shows a corresponding apparatus for reconverting the residual<br>
bitstream signal supplied by the apparatus of figure 13. The apparatus of figure 14 shows a<br>
large resemblance with the apparatus of the figures 7 and 8, in the sense that the signal<br>
combination unit 88 and the D/A converter 80 are the same as the a signal combination unit<br>
and the D/A converter respectively of figure 7. The input 72 of the prediction unit 74" is<br>
coupled to an input 92 of a four bit shift register 94". The four outputs of the four bit<br>
positions in the shift register 94" are coupled to corresponding inputs of a conversion unit<br>
96". The conversion unit 96" comprise the conversion table discussed and explained above<br>
with reference to the figure 12. An output 98 of the conversion unit 96" is coupled to a<br>
second input 101 of the signal combination unit 88.<br>
In response to a 4-bit bitsequence x1,x2,x3,x4 stored in the shift register<br>
94", the conversion unit 96" supplies either a 1-bit x5" at its output 98 or a 2-bit word<br>
x5",x6", in the way explained above with reference to figure 12. This bit x5" is a prediction<br>
of the bit x5, given by the conversion table 96", that will be supplied upon the next clock<br>
pulse by the combination unit 88 and stored as the new bit x4 in the most right storage<br>
position of the shift register 94". The residual bit present at the input 86 of the combination<br>
unit 88 is combined with the predicted bit x5" upon the clock pulse generated by the central<br>
processing unit 140, so as to obtain the replica of the original bit x5 in the original bitstream<br>
signal. When the residual bit is "0", which meant that a correct prediction was carried out in<br>
the apparatus of figure 13, the combination of the residual bit with the predicted bit x5"<br>
results in the right of the bit x5" to appear at the output 76 of the combination unit 88 as the<br>
bit x5. When the residual bit is "1", which meant that an incorrect prediction was carried out<br>
in the apparatus of figure 13, the combination of the residual bit with the predicted bit x5"<br>
results in the inverse right of the bit x5" to appear at the outpu 76 of the combination unit 88<br>
as the bit x5. In both cases, a correct replica of the bit x5 will appear at the output_76 of the<br>
combination unit 88.<br>
The 2-bit prediction x5",x6" is a prediction of the 2-bit word x5,x6,<br>
generated by the conversion table 96", that will be supplied upon the next two clock pulses of<br>
the central processing unit 140 by the combination unit 88 and stored as the new 2-bit word<br>
x3,x4 in the two most right storage positions of the shift register 94". Two residual bits<br>
present at the input 86 of the combination unit 88 are combined with the predicted 2-bit word<br>
x5",x6" so as to obtain the replica of the original 2-bit word x5,x6 in the original bitstream<br>
signal. When the two residual bits are "0,0", which meant that a correct prediction was<br>
carried out in the apparatus of figure 13, the combination of the residual bits with the<br>
predicted bits x5",x6" results in the right of the two bits x5",x6" to appear at the output 76 of<br>
the combination unit 88 as the bits x5,x6. When the residual bits were "1,1", which meant<br>
that an incorrect prediction was carried out in the apparatus of figure 13 on both the bits x5<br>
and x6, the combination of the two residual bits with the predicted bits x5",x6" results in the<br>
inverse bitvalues of the bits x5",x6" to appear at the output 76 of the combination unit 88 as<br>
the bits x5,x6. When one of the two residual bits is "1" and the other is "0", this means that<br>
one of the prediction bits is wrong and should be inverted in order to obtain two correct bits<br>
x5,x6. In all cases, a correct replica of the 2-bit word x5,x6 will appear at the output 76 of<br>
the combination unit 88.<br>
In the situation where, for subsequent portions of the bitstream signal, a<br>
corresponding conversion table is derived first in the apparatus of figure 13, eg. in the way<br>
explained above with reference to figure 12, it is desired to transmit the conversion table<br>
together with the residual bitstream signal so as to enable reconversion upon reception of the<br>
residual bitstream signal in the apparatus of figure 14. Figure 14 therefore shows an input<br>
terminal 142 for receiving the conversion table. The input terminal 142 is coupled to the<br>
central processing unit 140, which has a connection 144 with the prediction unit 96". Via this<br>
connection, the conversion table can be supplied to the prediction unit 96".<br>
It has been said earlier that a data compression step is carried out on the<br>
residual bitstream signal prior to transmission. Preferably, a data compression using a<br>
lossless coder is carried out. Lossless coders have the advantage that they can data compress<br>
the audio signal in such a way that, after data expansion by a lossless decoder, the original<br>
audio signal can be reconstructed in a substantially lossless way. That means that there is<br>
substantially no loss of information after compression-expansion. Lossless coders can be in<br>
the form of a variable length coder. Variable length coders are well known in the art.<br>
Examples of such variable length coders are Huffman coders, arithmetic coders and Lempel-<br>
Ziv coders. Reference is made in this respect to the publications "A method for the<br>
construction of minimum-redundancy codes" by D.A. Huffman, document D4 in the list of<br>
related documents, "An introduction to arithmetic coding" by G.G. Langdon, document D5 in<br>
the list of related documents, and "A universal algorithm for sequential data compression" by<br>
J. Ziv et al, document D6 in the list of related documents.<br>
Figure 15 shows an embodiment in which the apparatus of figure 1 is<br>
followed by a data compression unit 150, such as a lossless coder. The data compressed<br>
residual bitstream signal is recorded on an optical record carrier 156 by means of an optical<br>
recording unit 154.<br>
Figure 16 shows the corresponding reproduction from the optical record<br>
carrier 156. The apparatus shown in figure 16 comprises a data expansion unit 162, such as a<br>
lossless decoder, that carries out a data expansion step on the data compressed residual<br>
bitstream signal. The regenerated residual bitstream signal is supplied to the input 70 of the<br>
apparatus of figure 7.<br>
A further modification of the embodiment of figure 1 is as follows. In this<br>
modification, the prediction unit 10 is coupled between the output of the signal combination<br>
unit 42 and the input 44 of the signal combination unit 42. In this modification, the predicted<br>
version of the bitstream signal is derived by the prediction unit from the residual signal,<br>
supplied by the signal combination unit 42. This modification is shown in figure 18, which is<br>
in fact identical to the circuit construction of the prediction unit and the signal combination<br>
unit shown in figure 7.<br>
In an equivalent way, a further modification of the embodiment of figure 7 is as<br>
follows. In this modification, the prediction unit 74 is coupled between the input terminal 70<br>
and the input 101 of the signal combination unit 88. In this modification, the predicted<br>
version of the bitstream signal is derived by the prediction unit from the residual signal,<br>
supplied to the processing apparatus via the terminal 70. This modification is in fact identical<br>
to the circuit construction of the prediction unit and the signal combination unit shown in<br>
figure 1.<br>
A further improvement of the data processing apparatus can be obtained by a<br>
specific embodiment of the prediction unit, such as the prediction unit 10 in figure 1. In this<br>
specific embodiment, the prediction unit 10 is provided with an integrator for integrating the<br>
input signal, which is a representation of the bitstream signal, in the sense that the input<br>
signal has -1 and +1 representation values to represent the "0" and "1" bits in the bitstream<br>
signal. The integrator simply sums all the representation values, so its instantaneous output is<br>
the cumulative sum of all -1 and +1 values it has received. What the prediction unit in fact<br>
does, is to generate a pseudo audio signal and the predicted bit for the bitstream signal to be<br>
supplied to the output 12 is derived from this pseudo audio signal in the following way.<br>
The predictor derives from the last n sample values of the pseudo audio signal<br>
generated by the integrator a prediction value for the next sample of the pseudo audio signal.<br>
Next the value of the last sample of the pseudo audio signal generated is compared with the<br>
predicted value of the next sample. If, viewed along an amplitude axis, the value of the last<br>
sample of the pseudo audio signal is smaller than the prediction value of the next sample, it<br>
is concluded that the next predicted bit in the predicted bitstream signal corresponds to the<br>
+ 1 value (or logical "1") and when the value of the last sample of the pseudo audio signal is<br>
larger than the prediction value of the next sample, it is concluded that the next predicted bit<br>
in the bitstream signal corresponds to the -1 value (or logical "0"). The predicted bits are<br>
supplied to the output of the prediction unit 10 as the predicted bitstream signal.<br>
The predicted value of the next sample can be obtained by approximating the<br>
last n (which eq equals 40) samples of the pseudo audio signal with a straight line. It will be<br>
understood that more sophisticated approximation procedures (filter techniques) are equally<br>
well possible to predict the next sample value. In such situation, as said earlier, filter<br>
coefficients for such filters should be derived for the signal on a frame basis and transmitted<br>
so as to enable a corresponding decoding on the receiver side.<br>
Another data processing apparatus is shown in figure 19. In the data processing<br>
apparatus of figure 19, the bitstream signal is supplied to the input 44 of the signal<br>
combination unit 42, and via a prediction filter 10" and a quantizer Q to the input 40 of the<br>
signal combination unit 42. The apparatus is further provided with a data compression unit<br>
150" which comprises an entropy encoder 154 and a probability determining unit 156. In the<br>
present example, the entropy encoder 154 is in the form of an arithmetic coder for encoding<br>
the residual bitstream signal into a data compressed residual bitstream signal in response to<br>
probability values p supplied to its input 192. The probability determining unit 156<br>
determines a probability value indicating the probability that a bit in the residual bitstream<br>
signal supplied by the combination unit 42 has a predetermined logical value, such as "1".<br>
This probability value, denoted p in figure 19, is supplied to the arithmetic coder 154 so as<br>
to enable the data compression of the residual bitstream signal in the arithmetic coder 154.<br>
The determining unit 156 determines this probability value from the output signal of the<br>
prediction filter 10". This is different from what one would expect when using an arithmetic<br>
coder in the data compression unit 150, such as in figure 4 or 15, for compressing the<br>
residual bitstream signal. When using an arithmetic coder in the compression unit 150, the<br>
probability unit 156 would derive the probability value from the residual bitstream signal<br>
itself. In the embodiment of figure 19, however, the probability determining unit 156 derives<br>
the probability value from the output signal generated by the prediction filter 10". This has<br>
an advantage, in that a higher compression ratio can be obtained with the arithmetic coder<br>
154. The arithmetic coder 154 can data compress the residual bitstream signal on a frame<br>
basis.<br>
The functioning of the apparatus of figure 19 is as follows. The prediction filter<br>
10" realizes a prediction filtering on the bitstream signal so as to obtain a multi bit output<br>
signal. The multi bit output signal has a plurality of levels within a range of eg. +3 and -3.<br>
A quantizer Q receives the multi bit output signal and generates a bitstream signal therefrom,<br>
eg. by allocating a bit of "1" logical value if the multi bit output signal has a positive value<br>
and allocating a bit of "0" logical value if the multi bit output signal has a negative value.<br>
Further, for each of a plurality of subintervals in the value range of the multi bit output<br>
signal, it is determined what the probability is that the corresponding bit in the residual<br>
signal is eg. a "1" bit. This can be realized by counting the number of "ones" and "zeroes"<br>
occurring in the residual bitstream signal during a specific time interval, when the multi bit<br>
output signal falls in one of such ranges. The probabilities thus obtained for the various<br>
values in the multi bit output signal is subsequently supplied as the probability signal p to the<br>
arithmetic coder 154. The data compressed residual bitstream signal is supplied by the<br>
arithmetic coder 154 to an output line 158, for transmission via a transmission medium<br>
TRM.<br>
Figure 20 shows a corresponding data processing apparatus for decoding the<br>
data compressed residual bitstream signal, received via the transmission medium TRM. The<br>
data processing apparatus of figure 20 comprises an entropy decoder 172, which receives the<br>
data compressed residual bitstream signal via an input 174. In the present example, the<br>
entropy decoder 172 is in the form of an arithmetic decoder that carries out an arithmetic<br>
decoding step on the data compressed bitstream signal under the influence of a probability<br>
signal p, supplied to an input 176 so as to generate a replica of original residual bitstream<br>
signal which is supplied to an output 178. The replica is supplied to an input 86 of the signal<br>
combination unit 88. The signal combination unit 88 further receives a predicted version of<br>
the bitstream signal via the input 101 and generates the replica of the original bitstream<br>
signal at its output 76. The output 76 is coupled via a prediction filter 74" and a quantizer Q<br>
to the input 101 of the signal combination unit 88. The functioning of the prediction filter 74"<br>
and the quantizer Q can be identical to the functioning of the prediction filter 10" and the<br>
quantizer Q in figure 19, that is: the prediction filter 74" derives its filter coefficients from<br>
the input signal it receives via its input 72. In another embodiment, the prediction filter 74"<br>
receives the filter coefficients from side information received via the transmission medium<br>
TRM from the encoder apparatus of figure 19, as will be explained below.<br>
Further, a probability supply unit 180 is present for supplying the probability<br>
signal p to the arithmetic decoder 172. The probability signal p can be obtained in different<br>
ways. One way is, to derive the probability signal p from the output signal of the prediction<br>
filter 74", in the same way as the probability determining unit 156 determines then<br>
probability signal p from the prediction filter 10" in figure 19. In such situation, the supply<br>
unit 180 in figure 20 can be identical to the determining unit 156 in figure 19, and the supply<br>
unit 180 has an input coupled to the output of the prediction filter 74". Another way of<br>
generating the probability signal p, is by using side information received via the transmission<br>
medium TRM, as will be explained hereafter.<br>
Side information can be generated by the apparatus of figure 19 for<br>
transmission to the apparatus of figure 20. Such side information can include the filter<br>
coefficients for the filter 10" that are determined on a frame by frame basis, which<br>
coefficients are transmitted to the filter 74" for setting the correct filter characteristic of the<br>
filter 74". Further, the apparatus of figure 19 can generate parameters that describe the<br>
conversion of the multi bit output signal of the prediction filter 10" into the probability signal<br>
p. Such parameters are also included in the side information and transmitted to the supply<br>
unit 180, so as to enable the regeneration of the probability signal p in the apparatus of<br>
figure 20.<br>
In the above described embodiments of the figures 19 and 20, it is explained<br>
how the probability signal p can be derived from the multi bit output signal from the<br>
prediction filter 10" and 74" respectively. It should however be noted that the application of<br>
an arithmetic coder is also possible in data processing apparatuses that derive the predicted<br>
signal in a different way. Reference is made in this respect to the embodiments shown in<br>
figure 1, where the prediction unit 10 is in the form as disclosed in the figures 2 or 12. Now<br>
another way of deriving the probability signal p is required. It will be clear that, in the<br>
embodiments of the prediction unit as shown in figures 2 and 12, the probability signal p can<br>
be derived from the count numbers derived in the detector 22 and 22" respectively.<br>
The entropy encoder used in the embodiment of figure 19 is adapted to encode<br>
the residual bitstream signal using a probability signal in order to obtain the data compressed<br>
residual bitstream signal. One of such entropy encoder is the arithmetic coder described<br>
above. One other type of such entropy coder is, as an example, the well known finite state<br>
coder. The entropy decoder used in the embodiment of figure 20 is adapted to decode the<br>
data compressed residual bitstream signal using a probability signal in order to obtain a<br>
replica of the residual bitstream signal. One of such entropy decoder is the arithmetic<br>
decoder described above. One other type of such entropy decoder is, as an example, the well<br>
known finite state decoder.<br>
Whilst the invention has been described with reference to preferred<br>
embodiments thereof, it is to be understood that these are not limitative examples. Thus,<br>
various modifications may become apparent to those skilled in the art, without departing<br>
from the scope of the invention, as defined by the claims. When the audio signal is supplied<br>
in digital form, such as sampled at 44.1 kHz and the samples being expressed in eg. 16 bits,<br>
the A/D converter means are adapted to oversample the digital audio signal with eg. the<br>
frequency of 64 x 44.1 kHz so as to obtain the 1-bit bitstream signal which is supplied to the<br>
prediction unit 10.<br>
Further, as regards the conversion tables, such as the one shown and described<br>
in figure 12, the following can be said. In the phase of deriving the conversion table, it may<br>
occur that, as an example, the count values are such that the bit sequences 0,0,0,0 and<br>
0,0,1,0 result in the same prediction bit(s), that the bit sequences 0,0,0,1 and 0,0,1,1 result<br>
in the same prediction bit(s), that the bit sequences 0,1,0,0 and 0,1,1,0 result in the same<br>
prediction bit(s), that the bit sequences 1,0,0,0 and 1,0,1,0 result in the same prediction<br>
bit(s), the bit sequences 1,1,0,0 and 1,1,1,0 result in the same prediction bit(s), that the bit<br>
sequences 1,0,0,1 and 1,0,1,1 result in the same prediction bit(s), that the bit sequences<br>
1,1,0,1 and 1,1,1,1 result in the same prediction bit(s), and that the bit sequences 0,1,0,1<br>
and 0,1,1,1 result in the same prediction bit(s). In this situation, the bit x3 is in fact a don"t<br>
care bit and the prediction bit(s) x4 or x4,x5 can be predicted from the bit combination<br>
x1,x2,x4 alone.<br>
Further, the invention lies in each and every novel feature or combination of<br>
features.<br>
