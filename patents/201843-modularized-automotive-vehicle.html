BACKGROUND^QF JEHE,JMVENTieW<br>
1.	Field of the Invention:<br>
The present invention relates to a modularized automobile vehicle such as a modularized motorcycle or a modularized three-wheeled motor vehicle which comprises a plurality of interconnected modules having respective functions.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art:<br>
The general vehicle production system has a single production line where parts are assembled on vehi¬cle bodies while the vehicle bodies are being delivered along the production line.<br>
However, the vehicle production system as it is employed by a complete car manufacturer is disadvanta¬geous in that a large number of parts to be assembled are involved, many workers are required, and the inventory control of parts is tedious and time-consuming.  In view of such drawbacks of the conventional vehicle production system, efforts have been made to develop a system in which parts manufacturers assemble parts into modules and deliver the modules to a complete car manufacturer, and the complete car manufacturer assembles the modules into complete cars.<br>
Recently, some vehicles which have been devel¬oped and put to practical use have electric energy<br><br>
sources including fuel cells and storage batteries for generating propulsive energy in view of the limited availability of petroleum in the future and the growing recognition of environmental protection.<br>
Fuel cells and storage batteries mounted as energy sources instead of gasoline engines on vehicles are manufactured by dedicated manufacturers. If power modules incorporating fuel cells and storage batteries are manufactured by such dedicated manufacturers, then the vehicles can efficiently be assembled by complete car manufacturers.<br>
One conventional arrangement for manufacturing modularized automobile vehicles is disclosed in Japanese laid-open patent publication No. 10-59233. According to the disclosed system, a front suspension module, a front frame module, and a rear frame module are assembled on a power train module.<br>
Specifically, a power train module is complet¬ed by assembling parts including a muffler and a stand on a power unit having an engine along a power train module line.<br>
According to the conventional system, one wire harness is prepared for an entire motorcycle, and then attached to one of a front frame module and a rear frame module.  For manufacturing the motorcycle, various mod¬ules thereof are assembled together, and the wire harness is connected to necessary parts.<br><br>
The conventional module assembling scheme suf¬fers various problems-  According to the first problem, since the parts including the muffler and the stand are assembled one by one on the power unit along the power module line, the number of steps involved in the assem¬bled process is large, making it difficult to change the power module line to manufacture a different motorcycle type.<br>
The second problem is that parts associated with a handle are assembled in the front suspension mod¬ule.  Since it is customary to assemble a handle after a stem component of the front suspension module is inserted in the head pipe of a motorcycle frame, it is not prefer¬able to incorporate the handle in one module from the standpoint of the production line layout.<br>
The third problem is that because the wire harness of an entire motorcycle is attached to one mod¬ule, if the wire harness is attached to the rear frame module, then it will be necessary in a final assembling step to insert the wire harness into a pipe of the front frame module or fix the wire harness to the pipe of the front frame module.<br>
The fourth problem resides in the complexity of a process of connecting a throttle cable.  In motorcy¬cles, the throttle grip is turned to increase or reduce the rotational speed of the engine.  Specifically, an an¬gular movement of the throttle grip is transmitted<br><br>
through a throttle cable to the valve in a carburetor to adjust the opening of the valve to vary the rotational speed of the engine.  It is also necessary to change the amount of lubricating oil supplied to the engine depend¬ing on the rotational speed of the engine.<br>
Heretofore, when the throttle grip is turned, the angular movement of the throttle grip is transmitted through a single cable having an end connected to the throttle grip and a branch cable branched from the single cable to the carburetor valve and an oil pump for simul¬taneously operating the carburetor valve and the oil pump.<br>
When assembling the motorcycle, an end of the branch cable is connected to the carburetor valve and the other end thereof is connected to the oil pump, so that the angular movement of the throttle grip can be trans¬mitted simultaneously to the carburetor valve and the oil pump.<br>
However, it is an extremely complex process to connect the ends of the branch cable to the carburetor valve and the oil pump because the connections need to be made in narrow spaces.  Particularly since the amount of oil supplied from the oil pump is required to depend on the rotational speed of the engine, an oil adjusting process for adjusting the play of the branch cable needs to be performed when the end of the branch cable is con¬nected to the oil pump.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a modularized automobile vehicle which will solve the problems of the conventional modularized automobile vehicle production system.<br>
A modularized automotive vehicle provided by the present invention to solve the first problem of the conventional modularized automobile vehicle production system comprises a plurality of interconnected modules for performing respective functions, each of the modules being constructed of a plurality of parts, one of the modules comprising a power train module having a power unit, a stand unit constructed of interconnected parts, and a muffler unit constructed of interconnected parts, the stand unit and the muffler unit being assembled on the power unit.<br>
The power train module comprises a rear wheel unit, a rear cushion unit, and an air cleaner unit which are assembled on the power unit. With this arrangement, the number of assembling steps in assembly lines can be reduced.<br>
A modularized automotive vehicle provided by the present invention to solve the second problem of the conventional modularized automobile vehicle production system comprises a plurality of interconnected modules for performing respective functions, each of the modules being constructed of a plurality of parts, the modules<br><br>
including at least a handle module, a front suspension module, a front frame module, a power train module, and a rear frame module.<br>
With the handle module separated from the front suspension module, the inventory control of parts and the assembly line layout have an increased degree of freedom and are made highly efficient.  The number of as¬sembling steps in a power train module line is reduced, making it easy to modify the power train module line for the manufacture of different vehicle types.<br>
A frame module assembly may be divided into two or three frame modules in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle.  If divided into three frame modules, the modularized automotive vehicle further comprises an in¬termediate frame module disposed between the front frame module and the rear frame module.  The intermediate frame module facilitates adjustment of the entire length of the frame module assembly, and allows the number of frame variations to be increased.<br>
The intermediate frame module may comprise an intermediate frame and a main stand assembled thereon. While the main stand may be attached to a power train such as an engine, the efficiency of an assembling proc¬ess is increased if the main stand is attached to the in¬termediate frame module.<br>
The modules should preferably have joints joined by common joining members according to a common<br><br>
joining process.  If common bolts are used as the common joining members to join the joints and tightened from one side (from above) of the modules, the advantages offered by the modularized automotive vehicle are maximized.<br>
The various modules are constructed according to specific examples given below.<br>
The handle module comprises a handle unit, a rear handle cover unit, and a front handle cover unit, the handle unit comprising a handle with a throttle cable and a brake cable part assembled thereon, the rear handle unit comprising a rear handle cover with a meter unit and electric components including a starter switch, a horn switch, and a direction indicator switch assembled thereon, the front handle cover unit comprising a front handle cover with a head light and a pair of direction indicators assembled thereon.<br>
The front suspension unit comprises a front fork unit having a stem component with bearing races press-fitted therein, a pair of front cushion units, and a front wheel.<br>
The front frame module comprises a front frame unit having a head pipe with bearing races press-fitted therein, and a front stay unit having a front cover stay with electric components including a regulator and a horn assembled thereon.<br>
The power train module comprises a power unit, and a rear wheel unit, a muffler unit, a main stand unit.<br><br>
a rear cushion unit, and an air cleaner unit which are assembled on the power unit.<br>
The rear frame module comprises a rear frame unit having a rear frame with a hanger bushing press-fitted therein, an engine hanger, and a rear bracket unit having a tank bracket with a rear fender and a fuel tank assembled thereon.<br>
A modularized automotive vehicle provided by the present invention to solve the third problem of the conventional modularized automobile vehicle production system comprises a plurality of interconnected modules for performing respective functions, and a plurality of wire harnesses associated respectively with the modules, each of the harnesses having a connector connected to the wire harness associated with an adjacent one of the mod¬ules.<br>
With the above arrangement, when one of the modules of the modularized automotive vehicle is replaced in its entirety with another module, it is not necessary to make tedious and time-consuming adjustments with re¬spect to the other module for the connection of the wire harnesses.<br>
A modularized automotive vehicle provided by the present invention to solve the fourth problem of the conventional modularized automobile vehicle production system comprises a throttle grip, a carburetor, an oil pump, and a divided throttle cable for transmitting mo-<br><br>
tion of the throttle grip to the carburetor and the oil pump, the divided throttle cable comprising a first branch cable having an end connected to the carburetor and an opposite end connected to a connector, a second branch cable having an end connected to the oil pump and an opposite end connected to the connector, and a single cable having an end connected to the throttle grip and an opposite end connected to the connector.<br>
The above structure is effective to eliminate a cable connecting process in narrow spaces and a process of adjusting the oil pump.<br>
The above and other objects, features, and ad¬vantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which preferred embodi¬ments of the present invention are shown by way of illus¬trative example.<br>

As shown in FIG. 6, the modularized automotive vehicle may comprise three frame modules, i.e., the front frame module M3, the rear frame module M2, and an inter¬mediate frame module M6.<br><br>
In FIG. 6, the rear frame module M2 comprises a luggage box of FRP, and the intermediate frame module M6 is positioned between the rear frame module M2 and the front frame module M3.<br>
The rear frame module M2, the front frame mod¬ule M3, and the intermediate frame module M6 are fastened together by common bolts so that they can be intercon¬nected from one side of these modules.<br>
With the three frame modules employed, if the rear frame module M3 is available in three types, the front frame module M3 in three types, and the intermedi¬ate frame module M6 in three types, then a total of 27 vehicle types can be manufactured.<br>
As shown in FIG. 7, the front suspension mod¬ule M4 comprises a front fork unit 60 having a stem com¬ponent 60a with bearing races press-fitted therein, a pair of front cushion units 61, and a front wheel 62.<br>
As shown in FIG. 8, the handle module M5 com¬prises a handle unit 70, a rear handle cover unit 71, and a front handle cover unit 72.  The handle unit 70 com¬prise a handle 70a with a throttle cable and a brake ca¬ble part 70b assembled thereon.  The rear handle cover unit 71 comprises a rear handle cover 71a with a meter unit 71b and electric components including a starter switch, a horn switch, a direction indicator switch, etc. assembled thereon.  The front handle cover unit 72 com-<br><br>
prises a front handle cover 72a with a head light 72b and a pair of direction indicators 72c assembled thereon.<br>
The relationship between wire harnesses and the modules will be described below with reference to FIG. 9.  Conventional motorcycles employ a continuous wire harness.  However, according to the present inven¬tion, the handle module M5 has a wire harness Wl for sup¬plying electric energy to the electric components includ¬ing the starter switch, the horn switch, the direction indicator switch, etc.  The wire harness Wl is terminated by a connector 81 attached to an end thereof.<br>
The front frame module M3 has a wire harness W2 for supplying electric energy to the electric compo¬nents 45b. The wire harness W2 is terminated by a con¬nector 82 attached to an end thereof.<br>
The rear frame module M2 has a wire harness W3 which is terminated by a connector 83 attached to an end thereof.<br>
Each of the front suspension module M4 and the power train module Ml has no wire harness as they are not modules designed with wire harnesses.<br>
A divided throttle cable will be described be¬low with reference to FIGS. 10 and 11.  The divided throttle cable comprises a single cable 91 having an end connected to a throttle grip G and a modularized assembly 92.<br><br>
The modularized assembly 92 comprises a first branch cable 94 having an end connected to a valve in a carburetor 93, a second branch cable 96 having an end connected to an oil pump 95, and a connector 98 to which the other ends of the first branch cable 94 and the sec¬ond branch cable 96 are connected.<br>
The second branch cable 96 has an outer sheath fixed to a stay 95 which is not part of the modularized assembly 92.<br>
The connector 98 has a slit 98a slightly wider than an inner core 91a of the single cable 91, and a re¬cess 98b in which a distal end 91b of the inner core 91a is fitted.  The inner core 91a is inserted into the con¬nector 98 through the slit 98a, and pulled to fit the distal end 91b into the recess 98b, thereby connecting the single cable 91 and the first and second branch ca¬bles 94, 96 to each other.<br>
The connector 98 is not limited to the illus¬trated structure, but may be of any design insofar as it allows the first and second branch cables 94, 96 and the single cable 91 to be connected to each other in one op¬eration.<br>
The connector 98 and the joined ends of the single cable 91 and the first and second branch cables 94, 96 are housed in a tubular cover 99.  Though the tu¬bular cover 99 is not a requirement, it is effective to reliably prevent the single cable 91 and the first and<br><br>
second branch cables 94, 96 from being disconnected from each other.<br>
For assembling the modularized assembly 92 on the carburetor 93 and the oil pump 95 mounted on the en¬gine, the first branch cable 94 and the second branch ca¬ble 96 whose other ends are connected to the connector 98 are prepared.<br>
Then, a cap top of the carburetor 93 is re¬moved, and the carburetor valve is taken out.  The end of the first branch cable 94 remote from the connector 98 is connected to the carburetor valve, which is then put back into place, and then the cap top is fastened.<br>
The end of the second branch cable 96 remote from the connector 98 is connected to the oil pump 95, and a cable nut is removed.  The second branch cable 96 is set on the stay 97, and a lock nut is tightened with play adjusted to adjust the oil pump 95.<br>
After the modularized assembly 92 thus assem¬bled on the carburetor 93 and the oil pump 95, the engine is mounted on a motorcycle frame.  By this time, the first branch cable 94 and the carburetor valve have been connected to each other, the second branch cable 96 and the oil pump 96 have been connected to each other, and the oil pump 95 has been adjusted.  Therefore, the actual work needed is to connect the single cable 91 and the connector 98 to each other and attach the tubular cover 99.<br><br>
After the above modules are assembled and com¬pleted along their respective lines, they are lowered to the respective positions on the main module line 7 by the lifters 6.  The modules are then installed on the power train module Ml long the main module line 7.<br>
While the modules may be assembled in a facto¬ry of a complete car manufacturer, they may be assembled in dedicated manufacturers and delivered to a factory of a complete car manufacturer where they may be installed on power train modules.<br>
Although certain preferred embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described in de¬tail, it should be understood that various changes and modifications may be made therein without departing from the scope of the appended claims.<br><br><br>
