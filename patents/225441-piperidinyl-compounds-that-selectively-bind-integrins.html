				<td>PIPERIDINYL COMPOUNDS THAT SELECTIVELY BIND INTEGRINS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This application claims benefit of provisional patent application serial number<br>
60/404,239, filed on 16 August 2003, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein.<br>
This invention relates to novel compounds and methods for use in treating an<br>
intcgrin mediated disorder. More particularly, this, invention relates to piperidinyl<br>
compounds that selective bind integrin receptors and methods for treating an integrin<br>
mediated disorder.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Integrins arc a family of transmembrane receptors, each of which is composed<br>
of a pair of heterodimeric, noncovalently associated glycoproteins, designated as a and<br>
ß chains. The a subunit contains heavy and light chains as part of its extracellular<br>
domain, with 3-4 divalent-cation binding sites; the light chain also contains<br>
transmembrane and intracellular domains. The ß-subunit contains a large extracellular<br>
domain, as well as transmembrane and int'acellular domains. Integrins arc cell surface<br>
receptors, which bind to extracellular matrix adhesive proteins such as fibrinogen,<br>
libronectin, vitronectin and osteopontin. These transmembrane glycoproteins are<br>
classified by the ß subunits. The ß3 class of integrin family has received the most<br>
attention in recent drug discovery efforts (W.J. Hoekstra, Current Medicinal Chemistry,<br>
1998, 5, 195), however, the ß5 class has also become a focus of attention. Some of the<br>
disease states that have been associated with a strong ß3 and ß5 intcgrin component in<br>
their etiologies are thrombosis (integrin a2bß3 also called GPIIb/IIIa); unstable angina<br>
(GPIIb/IIIa); restenosis (GPIIb/IIIa and integrin av(33); arthritis, vascular disorders or<br>
osteoporosis (avß3); tumor angiogenesis, multiple sclerosis, neurological disorders,<br>
asthma, vascular injury or diabetic retinopathy (avß3 or avß5) and tumor metastasis<br>
(avß3). See S.A. Mousa, et al, Emerging Therapeutic Targets, 2000, 4(2) 148-149:<br>
and W.H. Miller, et al., Drug Discovery Today, 2000, 5(9), 397-40. Antibodies and/or<br>
low-molecular weight compound antagonists of avß3 have shown efficacy against these<br>
respective disease states in animal models (J. Samanen, Current Pharmaceutical<br>
Design, 1997, 3 545-584) and thereby offer promise as therapeutic agents. Several<br>
patents have described compounds that could interact with these integrins. For<br>
example, United States Patents 5,919,792 B1, 6,211,191 Bl, and WO 01/96334 and<br>
WO 01/23376 describe avß3 and (avß5 integrin receptor antagonists.<br>
The present invention provides a new class of piperidinyl compounds, which<br>
selective bind to (33, (35 or dual integrin receptors (e.g. avß3 and av(35) for the treatment<br>
of a wide variety of integrin mediated disease states.<br>

The compounds of the present invention may also be present in the form of<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts. For use in medicine, the salts of the compounds of<br>
this invention refer to non-toxic "pharmaceutically acceptable salts" (Ref. International<br>
J. Pharm., 1986, 33, 201-217; J. Pharm.Sci, 1977 (Jan), 66, 1, 1). Other salts may,<br>
however, be useful in the preparation of compounds according to this invention or of<br>
their pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Representative organic or inorganic acids<br>
include, but are not limited to, hydrochloric," hydrobromic, hydriodic, perchloric,<br>
sulfuric, nitric, phosphoric, acetic, propionic, glycolic, lactic, succinic, maleic, fumaric,<br>
malic, tartaric, citric, benzoic, mandelic, methanesulfonic, hydroxyethanesulfonic,<br>
benzenesulfonic, oxalic, pamoic, 2-naphthalenesulfonic, p-toluenesulfonic,<br>
cyclohexanesulfamic, salicylic, saccharinic or trifluoroacetic acid. Representative<br>
organic or inorganic bases include, but are not limited to, basic or cationic salts such as<br>
benzathine, chlorpprocaine, choline, diethanolamine, ethylenediamine, meglumine,<br>
procaine, aluminum, calcium, lithium, magnesium, potassium, sodium and zinc.<br>
The present invention includes, within its scope prodrugs of the compounds of<br>
this invention. In general, such prodrugs will be functional derivatives of the<br>
compounds which are readily convertible in vivo into the required compound. Thus, in<br>
the methods of treatment of the present invention., the term "administering" shall<br>
encompass the treatment of the various disorders described with the compound<br>
specifically disclosed or with a compound which may not be specifically disclosed, but<br>
which converts to the specified compound in vivo after administration to the subject.<br>
Conventional procedures for the selection and preparation of suitable prodrug<br>
derivatives are described, for example, in "Design of Prodrugs", ed. H. Bundgaard,<br>
Elsevier, 1985.<br>
Where the compounds according to this invention have at least one chiral<br>
center, they may accordingly exist as cnantiomers. Where the compounds possess two<br>
or more chiral centers, they may additionally exist as diastereomers. Where the<br>
processes for the preparation of the compounds according to the invention give rise to<br>
mixtures of stereoisomers, these isomers may be separated by conventional techniques<br>
such as preparative chromatography. The compounds may be prepared in racemic form<br>
or as individual enantiomers or diasteromers by either stereospecific synthesis or by<br>
resolution. The compounds may be resolved into their component enantiomers or<br>
diasteromers by standard techniques. It is to be understood that all stereoisomers,<br>
racemic mixtures, diastereomers and enantiomers thereof are encompassed within the<br>
scope of the present invention.<br>
During any of the processes for preparation of the compounds of the present<br>
invention, it may be necessary and/or desirable to protect sensitive or reactive groups on<br>
any of the molecules concerned. This may be achieved by means of conventional<br>
protecting groups, such as those described in Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry,<br>
ed. J.F.W. McOmie, Plenum Press, 1973; and T.W. Greene &amp; P.G.M. Wuts, Protective<br>
Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1991. The protecting groups may be<br>
removed at a convenient subsequent stage using methods known in the art.<br>
Furthermore, some of the crystalline forms for the compounds may exist as<br>
polymorphs and as such are intended to be included in the present invention. In<br>
addition, some of the compounds may form solvates with water (i.e., hydrates) or<br>
common organic solvents and such solvates are also intended to be encompassed within<br>
the scope of this invention.<br>
As used herein, the following underlined terms are intended to have the<br>
following meanings:<br>
The term "Ca-b" (where a and b are integers referring to a designated number of<br>
carbon atoms) refers to an alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, alkoxy or cycloalkyl radical or to the<br>
alkyl portion of a radical in which alkyl appears as the prefix root containing from a to<br>
b carbon atoms inclusive. For example, C1-3 denotes a radical containing 1, 2 or 3<br>
carbon atoms.<br>
The term "alkyl" refers to an optionally substituted saturated or partially<br>
unsaturated, branched, straight-chain or cyclic monovalent hydrocarbon radicals<br>
derived by the removal of one hydrogen atom from a single carbon atom of an alkane<br>
molecule, thus forming the point of attachment. The term "alkenyl" refers to an<br>
optionally substituted partially unsaturated branched or straight-chain monovalent<br>
hydrocarbon radical having at least one carbon-carbon double bond and derived by the<br>
removal of one hydrogen atom from a single carbon atom of an alkene molecule, thus<br>
forming the point of attachment. The radical may be in either the cis or trans<br>
conformation about the double bond(s). The term "alkynyl" refers to an optionally<br>
substituted partially unsaturated branched or straight-chain monovalent hydrocarbon<br>
radical having at least one carbon-carbon triple bond and derived by the removal of one<br>
hydrogen atom from a single carbon atom of an alkyne molecule, thus forming the point<br>
of attachment. The term "alkoxy" refers to an optionally substituted saturated or<br>
partially unsaturated, branched, straight-chain monovalent hydrocarbon radical derived<br>
by the removal of the hydrogen atom from the single oxygen atom of an allcane, alkene<br>
or alkyne molecule, thus forming the point of attachment. An alkyl alkenyl, alkynyl or<br>
alkoxy radical is optionally substituted within the radical or on a terminal carbon atom<br>
(for a chain) with that amount of substituents allowed by available saturated valences.<br>
The term "-C1-8alkyl(Rx)" (where x is an integer referring to a designated<br>
substitutent group) refers to an Rx substituent group which may be substituted within an<br>
alykl chain, on a terminal carbon atom and may be similarly substituted on an alkenyl,<br>
alkynyl or alkoxy radical with a designated amount of substituents where allowed by<br>
available chemical bond valences. The term "-C1-8alkyl(Rx)" refers to an Rx substituent<br>
group which may also be directly substituted on a pointof attachment without an alkyl<br>
linking group (wherein Co is a placeholder for the Rx- substituent with a direct bond to<br>
the point of attachment).<br>
The term "cycloalkyl" refers to saturated or partially unsaturated cyclic<br>
monovalent hydrocarbon radical consistent with the definitions of alkyl, alkanyl,<br>
alkenyl and alkynyl. Specifically included within the definition of cycloalkyl are fused<br>
polycyclic ring systems in which one or more rings are aromatic and one or more rings<br>
are saturated or partially unsaturated (it being understood that the radical may also<br>
occur on the aromatic ring). For example, the cycloalkyl groups are saturated or<br>
partially unsaturated or monocyclic alkyl radicals of from 3-8 carbon atoms (derived<br>
from a molecule such as cyclopropane, cyclobutane, cyclopentane, cyclohexane or<br>
cycloheptane); saturated or partially unsaturated fused or benzofused cyclic alkyl<br>
radicals of from 9 to 12 carbon atoms; or, saturated or partially unsaturated fused or<br>
benzo fused tricyclic or polycyclic alkyl radicals of from 13 to 20 carbon atoms.<br>
The term "heterocyclyl" refers to a saturated or partially unsaturated cyclic alkyl<br>
radical in which one or more carbon atoms are independently replaced with the same or<br>
different heteroatom. Specifically included within the definition of heterocyclyl are<br>
fused polycyclic ring systems in which one or more rings are aromatic and one or more<br>
rings are saturated or partially unsaturated (it being understood that the radical may also '<br>
occur on the aromatic ring). Typical heteroatoms to replace the carbon atom(s) include,<br>
but are not limited to, N, O, S and the like. For example, the heterocyclyl group is a<br>
saturated or partially unsaturated five membered monocyclic alkyl ring of which at least<br>
one member is replaced by a N, O or S atom and which optionally contains one<br>
additional O atom replacing an additional member of the alkyl ring or one additional N<br>
atom replacing a member of the alkyl ring; a saturated or partially unsaturated six<br>
membered monocyclic alkyl ring of which one, two or three members of the alkyl ring<br>
are replaced by a N atom and optionally one member of the alkyl ring is replaced by a O<br>
or S atom or two members of the alkyl ring are replaced ,by O or S atoms; a saturated or<br>
partially unsaturated 5-6 membered heterocylic ring as previously defined fused to a<br>
heteroaryl as hereinafter defined; a saturated, partially unsaturated or benzofused nine<br>
or 10 membered bicyclic alkyl wherein at least one member of the ring is replaced by<br>
N, O, or S atom and which optionally one or two additional members of the bicyclic<br>
alkyl are replaced by N, O or S atoms; or, a saturated, partially unsaturated or<br>
benzofused 11 to 20 membered polycyclic alkyl of which at least one member is<br>
replaced by a N, O or S atom and which optionally one, two or three additional<br>
members of the polycyclic alkyl are replaced by N atoms. Examples of saturated or<br>

The term "aryl" refers to a monovalent aromatic hydrocarbon radical derived by<br>
the removal of one hydrogen atom from a single carbon atom of an aromatic ring<br>
system, thus forming the point of attachment for the radical. For example, the aryl<br>
group is derived from an unsaturated aromatic monocyclic ring system containing 5 to 6<br>
carbon atoms (such as phenyl, derived from benzene); an unsaturated aromatic bicyclic<br>
ring system containing 9 to 10 carbon atoms (such as naphthyl, derived from<br>
naphthalene); or, an unsaturated aromatic tricyclic ring system containing 13 to 14<br>
hydrogen carbon atoms (such as anthracenyl, derived from anthracene). The term<br>
"aromatic ring system" refers to an unsaturated cyclic or polycyclic ring system having<br>
an "aromatic" conjugated p electron system. Specifically excluded from the definition<br>
of aryl are fused ring systems in which one or more rings are saturated or partially<br>
unsaturated. Typical aryl groups include, but are not limited to, anthracenyl,<br>
naphthalenyl, azulenyl, benzenyl and the like<br>
The term "heteroaryl" refers to a monovalent heteroaromatic radical derived by<br>
the removal of one hydrogen atom from a single atom of a heteroaromatic ring system,<br>
thus forming the point of attachment for the radical. The term "heteroaromatic ring<br>
system" refers to an aromatic ring system in which one or more carbon atoms are each<br>
independently replaced with a heteroatom. Typical heteratoms to replace the carbon<br>
atoms include, but are not limited to, N, O, S, and the like; Specifically excluded from<br>
the definition of heteroaromatic ring system are fused ring systems in which one or<br>
more rings are saturated or partially unsaturated. For example, the heteroaryl group is<br>
derived from a heteroaromatic monocyclic ring system containing five members of<br>
which at least one member is a N, O or S atom and which optionally contains one, two<br>
or three additional N atoms; a heteroaromatic monocyclic ring system having six<br>
members of which one, two or three members are an N atom; a heteroaromatic fused<br>
bicyclic ring system having nine members of which at least one member is a N, O or S<br>
atom and which optionally contains one, two or three additional N atoms; a<br>
heteroaromatic fused bicyclic ring system having ten members of which one, two or<br>
three members are a N atom; a heteroaromatic fused tricyclic ring system containing 13<br>

The term "independently" means that when a group is substituted with more<br>
than one substituent that the substituents may be the same or different. The term<br>
"dependently" means that the substituents are specified in an indicated combination of<br>
structure variables.<br>
Under standard nomenclature rules used throughout this disclosure, the terminal<br>
portion of the designated side chain is described first followed by the adjacent<br>
functionality toward the point of attachment. Thus, for example, a "phenylC1-<br>
6alkylamidoC1-6alkyl" substituent refers to a group of the formula:<br><br>
A substituent's point of attachment may also be indicated by a dashed line to<br>
indicate the point(s) of attachment, followed by the adjacent functionality and ending<br>
with the terminal functionality such as, for example, __-(C1-6)alkyl-carbonyl-NH-(C1-<br>
6)alkyl-phenyl.<br>
It is intended that the definition of any substituent or variable at a particular<br>
location in a molecule be independent of its definitions elsewhere in that molecule. It is<br>
understood that substituents and substitution patterns on the compounds of this<br>
invention can be selected by one of ordinary skill in the art to provide compounds that<br>
are chemically stable and that can be readily synthesized by techniques known in the art<br>
as well as those methods set forth herein.<br>
Integrins are a widely expressed family of calcium or magnesium dependent a or<br>
ß heterodimeric cell surface receptors, which bind to extracellular matrix adhesive<br>
proteins such as fibrinogen, fibronectin. vitronectin and osteopontin. The integrin<br>
receptors are transmembranc glycoproteins (GP's) known for their large extracellular<br>
domains and are classified by at least 8 known ß subunits and 14 a subunits (S. A.<br>
Mousa, et al., Emerging Theraupeutic Targets, 2000, 4, (2), 143-153).<br>
For example, the ß1 subfamily has the largest number of integrins wherein the<br>
various a subunits associate with various ß subunits: ß3, ß5, ß6 and ß8 (S. A. Mousa, et<br>
al., Emerging Theraupeutic Targets, 2000, 4, (2), 144-147). Some of the disease states<br>
that have a strong avß3, avß5 and aIIbß3 (also referred to as GPIIb/IIIa) integrin<br>
component in their etiologies are unstable, angina, thromboembolic disorders or<br>
atherosclerosis (GPIIb/IIIa); thrombosis or restenosis (GPIIb/IIIa or avß3); restenosis<br>
(dual avß3/GPHb/IIIa); rheumatoid arthritis, vascular disorders or osteoporosis (avß3);<br>
tumor angiogenesis, tumor metastasis, tumor growth, multiple sclerosis, neurological<br>
disorders, asthma, vascular injury or diabetic retinopathy (avß3 or avß5); and,<br>
angiogenesis (dual avß3/avß5) (S. A. Mousa, et al.. Emerging Theraupeutic Targets,<br>
2000, 4, (2), 148-149; W. H. Miller, et al., Drug Discovery Today 2000, 5 (9), 397-407;<br>
and, S. A. Mousa, et al., Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents?, 1999, 9 (9), 1237-1248). The ß3<br>
subunit has received significant attention in recent drug discovery efforts. (W. J. Hoekstra,<br>
Current Medicinal Chemistry 1998, 5, 195). Antibodies and/or low-molecular weight<br>
compound antagonists of avp3 have shown efficacy in animal models (J. Samanen,<br>
Current Pharmaceutical Design 1997, 3, 545) and, thereby, offer promise as medicinal<br>
agents.<br>
Integrin antagonists have typically been designed after the bioactive arginine-<br>
glycine-aspartate (RGD) conformation of peptides derived from the primary ligand<br>
vitronectin. The RGD motif is the general cell attachment sequence of many<br>
extracellular matrix, blood and cell surface proteins, as half of the approximately 20<br>
known integrins bind the RGD-containing adhesion ligands. To discover RGD<br>
peptides with integrin selectivity, peptides with both restricted conformations and<br>
alterations of flanking residues have been studied. In particular, the structural<br>
requirements for interaction of the RGD sequence with GPIIb/IIIa and the inhibitory<br>
potential of a series of nonpeptidic mimetics on platelet aggregation and interactions<br>
with the extracellular matrix have been described (D. Varon, et al., Thromb.<br>
Haemostasis, 1993, 70(6), 1030-1036). Iterative synthesis of cyclic and alicyclic<br>
peptides and computer modelling have provided potent, selective agents as a platform<br>
for nonpeptide av (as in avß3) integrin antagonist design.<br>
Integrin antagonists have been implicated as useful for inhibiting bone<br>
resorption (S.B. Rodan and G.A. Rodan, Integrin Function In Osteoclasts, Journal of<br>
Endocrinology, 1997, 154: S47-S56). In vertebrates, bone resorption is mediated by the<br>
action of cells known as osteoclasts, large multinucleated cells of up to about 400 mm<br>
in diameter that resorb mineralized tissue, chiefly calcium carbonate and calcium<br>
phosphate. Osteoclasts are actively motile cells that migrate along the surface of bone<br>
and can bind to bone, secrete necessary acids and proteases, thereby causing the actual<br>
resorption of mineralized tissue from the bone. More specifically, osteoclasts are<br>
believed to exist in at least two physiological states, namely, the secretory state and the<br>
migratory or motile state. In the secretory state, osteoclasts are flat, attach to the bone<br>
matrix via a tight attachment zone (sealing zone), become highly polarized, form a<br>
ruffled border and secrete lysosomal enzymes and protons to resorb bone. The<br>
adhesion of osteoclasts to bone surfaces is an important initial step in bone resorption.<br>
In the migratory or motile state, osteoclasts migrate across bone matrix and do not take<br>
part in resorption until they again attach to bone.<br>
Integrins are involved in osteoclast attachment, activation and migration. The<br>
most abundant integrin receptor on osteoclasts (e.g., on rat, chicken, mouse and human<br>
osteoclasts) is the avß3 integrin receptor, which is thought to interact in bone with<br>
matrix proteins that contain the RGD sequence. Antibodies to avß3 block bone<br>
resorption in vitro, indicating that this integrin plays a key role in the resorptive<br>
process. There is increasing evidence to suggest that avß3 ligands can be used<br>
effectively to inhibit osteoclast mediated bone resorption in vivo in mammals.<br>
The current major bone diseases of public concern are osteoporosis,<br>
hypercalcemia of malignancy, osteopenia due to bone metastases, periodontal disease,<br>
hyperparathyroidism, periarticular erosions in rheumatoid arthritis, Paget's disease,<br>
immobilization-induced osteopenia and glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis. All of<br>
these conditions are characterized by bone loss, resulting from an imbalance between<br>
bone resorption, i.e. breakdown and bone formation, which continues throughout life at<br>
the rate of about 14% per year on the average. However, the rate of bone turnover<br>
differs from site to site; for example, it is higher in the trabecular bone of the vertebrae<br>
and the alveolar bone in the jaws than in the cortices of the long bones. The potential<br>
for bone loss is directly related to turnover and can amount to over 5% per year in<br>
vertebrae immediately following menopause, a condition that leads to increased fracture<br>
risk.<br>
In the United States, there are currently about 20 million people with detectable<br>
fractures of the vertebrae due to osteoporosis. In addition, there are about 250,000 hip<br>
fractures per year attributed to osteoporosis. This clinical situation is associated with a<br>
12% mortality rate within the first two years, while 30% of the patients require nursing<br>
home care after the fracture. Individuals suffering from all the conditions listed above<br>
would benefit from treatment with agents that inhibit bone resorption.<br>
Additionally, avß3 ligands have been found to be useful in treating and or<br>
inhibiting restenosis (i.e. recurrence of stenosis after corrective surgery on the heart<br>
valve), atherosclerosis, diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration and angiogencsis<br>
(i.e. formation of new blood vessels) and inhibiting viral disease.<br>
Moreover, it has been postulated that the growth of tumors depends on an<br>
adequate blood supply, which in turn is dependent on the growth of new vessels into the<br>
tumor; thus, inhibition of angiogencsis can cause tumor regression in animal models<br>
(Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 1991, 12th ed.). Therefore, avß3<br>
antagonists, which inhibit angiogenesis can be useful in the treatment of cancer by<br>
inhibiting tumor growth (Brooks et al., Cell, 1994, 79, 1157-1164). Evidence has also<br>
been presented suggesting that angiogenesis is a central factor in the initiation and<br>
persistence of arthritic disease and that the vascular integrin avß3 may be a preferred<br>
target in inflammatory arthritis. Therefore, avß3 antagonists that inhibit angiogenesis<br>
may represent a novel therapeutic approach to the treatment of arthritic disease, such as<br>
rheumatoid arthritis (C.M. Storgard, et al., Decreased Angiogenesis and Arthritic<br>
Disease in Rabbits Treated With an avp3 Antagonist, J. Clin. Invest, 1999, 103, 47-<br>
54).<br>
Inhibition of the avß5 integrin receptor can also prevent neovascularization. A<br>
monoclonal antibody for avß5 has been shown to inhibit VEGF-induced angiogenesis<br>
in rabbit cornea and the chick chorioallantoic membrane model (M.C. Friedlander, et<br>
al., Science, 1995, 270, 1500-1502). Thus, avp5 antagonists are useful for treating and<br>
preventing macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, cancer and metastatic tumor<br>
growth.<br>
Inhibition of av integrin receptors can also prevent angiogenesis and<br>
inflammation by acting as antagonists of other ß subunits, such as avß6 and avß8<br>
(Melpo Christofidou-Solomidou, et al., Expression and Function of Endothelial Cell on<br>
Integrin Receptors in Wound-Induced Human Angiogenesis in Human Skin/SCID 25<br>
Mice Chimeras, American Journal of Pathology, 1997, 151, 975-83; and, Xiao-Zhu<br>
Huang, et al., Inactivation of the Integrin ß6 Subunit Gene Reveals a Role of Epithelial<br>
Integrins in Regulating Inflamnation in the Lungs and Skin, Journal of Cell Biology,<br>
1996, 133,921-28).<br>
An antagonist to the av integrin can act to inhibit or minimize adhesions that<br>
result from either wounding or surgical adhesions. Post-surgical adhesions result as an<br>
anomaly of the wound healing process. Cell adhesion and the migration of fibroblasts<br>
are major players in this process. Trauma caused by the wounding, a surgical<br>
procedure, normal tissue manipulation in surgery, or bleeding during a surgical<br>
procedure can act to disrupt the peritoneum and expose the underlying stroma leading<br>
to the release of inflammatory mediators and an increase in capillary permeability.<br>
Inflammatory cells are subsequently liberated and the formation of a fibrin clot ensues.<br>
Adhesions are formed and intensify as fibroblasts and inflammatory cells continue to<br>
infiltrate this extracellular matrix rich in fibrin. The extracellular matrix is composed<br>
of adhesive proteins which act as ligands for the av integrin. To inhibit post-surgical<br>
adhesion development, application of an av antagonist could be parenteral,<br>
subcutaneous, intravenous, oral, topical or transdermal. The av integrin antagonist can<br>
be administered before, during or after a surgical procedure. When administered during<br>
a surgical procedure the antagonists can be administered by aerosol, in a pad, gel, film,<br>
sponge, solution, suspension or similar suitable pharmaceutically acceptable earner to<br>
the area in which the surgery is performed.<br>

As will be understood by those skilled in the art, the appropriate doses of<br>
chemotherapeutic agents will be generally around those already employed in clinical<br>
therapies wherein the chemotherapeutics arc administered alone or in combination with<br>
other chemotherapeutics. By way of example only, agents such as cisplatin and other<br>
DNA alkylating are used widely to treat cancer. The efficacious dose of cisplatin used<br>
in clinical applications is about 20 mg/m2 for 5 days every three weeks for a total of three Courses. Cisplatin is not absorbed orally and must therefore be delivered via<br>
injection intravenously, subcutaneously, intratumorally or intrapcritoneally. Further<br>
useful agents include compounds that interfere with DNA replication, mitosis and<br>
chromosomal segregation. Such chcmotherapeutic agents include adriamycin<br>
(doxorubicin), etoposide, verapamil or podophyllotoxin and the like and are widely<br>
used in clinical settings for tumor treatment. These compounds are administered<br>
through bolus injections intravenously at doses ranging from about 25 to about 75<br>
mg/m2 at 21 day intervals (for adriamycin) or from about 35 to about 50 mg/m2 (for<br>
etoposide) intravenously or at double the intravenous dose orally. Agents that disrupt<br>
the synthesis and fidelity of polynucleotide precursors such as 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) are<br>
preferentially used to target tumors. Although quite toxic, 5-FU is commonly used via<br>
intravenous administration with doses ranging from about 3 to about 15 mg/kg/day.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention includes a method for administering a<br>
compound of the present invention in combination with radiation therapy. As used<br>
herein, "radiation therapy" refers to a therapy that comprises exposing the subject in<br>
need thereof to radiation. Such therapy is known to those skilled in the art. The<br>
appropriate scheme of radiation therapy will he similar to those already employed in<br>
clinical therapies wherein the radiation therapy is used alone or in combination with<br>
other chemotherapeutics.<br>
An aspect of the present invention includes a method for administering a<br>
compound of the present invention in combination, with a gene therapy or for use of a<br>
compound of the present invention as a gene therapy means. The term "gene therapy"<br>
refers to a therapy targeting angiogenic endothelial cells or tumor tissue during tumor<br>
development. Gene therapy strategies include the restoration of defective cancer-<br>
inhibitory genes, cell transduction or transfection with antisense DNA (corresponding<br>
to genes coding for growth factors and their receptors) and the use of "suicide genes."<br>
The term "gene therapy means" refers to the use of a targeting vector comprising a<br>
combination of a cationic nanoparticlc coupled to an av-targeting ligand to influence<br>
blood vessel biology; whereby genes are selectively delivered to angiogenic blood<br>
vessels (as described in Hood, J.D., et al. Tumor Regression by Targeted Gene Delivery<br>
to the Neovasculature, Science, 2002, 28 June, 296, 2404-2407).<br>
Another aspect of the present invention includes a method for treating or<br>
ameliorating an av integrin mediated neoplasin in a subject in need thereof comprising<br>
administering to the subject an effective amount of a gene therapy combination product<br>
comprising a compound of Formula (1) or composition thereof and a gene therapeutic<br>
agent; wherein the product is delivered or "seeded" directly to a neoplasm or the<br>
microenvironment thereof by antagonizing the av integrin receptors of the neoplasm or<br>
microenvironment thereof.<br>
The term "delivered or 'seeded' directly to a neoplasm" includes using a<br>
compound of Formula (I) or composition thereof as a gene therapy means whereby the<br>
compound or composition thereof functions as a targeting agent which directs the<br>
conjugate to its intended site of action (i.e., to neoplastic vascular endothelial cells or to<br>
tumor cells). Because of the specific interaction of the av integrin inhibitor as a<br>
targeting agent and its corresponding av integrin receptor site, a compound of this<br>
invention can be administered with high local concentrations at or near a targeted av<br>
integrin receptor, or subtype thereof, thus treating the av integrin mediated disorder<br>
more effectively.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention includes a method for administering a<br>
compound of the present invention in combination with an immunotherapy. As used<br>
herein, "immunotherapy" refers to a therapy targeted to a particular protein involved in<br>
tumor development via antibodies specific to such protein. For example, monoclonal<br>
antibodies against vascular endothelial growth factor have been used in treating<br>
cancers.<br>
An aspect of the present invention includes a method for tumor imaging in a<br>
subject in need thereof comprising advantageously coadministering to the subject an<br>
effective amount of a compound of Formula (I) or composition thereof; wherein the<br>
compound or composition thereof is conjugated with and delivers a non-invasive tumor<br>
imaging agent to a tumor or to the microenvironment around the tumor.<br>
The terms "conjugated with" and "delivers a non-invasive tumor imaging agent"<br>
refers to a compound of Formula (I) or composition thereof bound to an imaging agent<br>
by a conjugation means known to those skilled in the art; wherein the compound or<br>
composition thereof acts as a targeting agent for antagonizing the av integrin receptors<br>
of a neoplasm or the microenvironment thereof; and, wherein the conjugation means<br>
facilitates and selectively delivers the imaging agent to the neoplasm or the<br>
microenvironment thereof (as described in PCT Application WO00/35887,<br>
WO00/35492, WO00/35488 or WO99/58162). The term "imaging agent," including<br>
but not limited to Technetium99, refers to imaging agents known to those skilled in the<br>
art. The term "conjugation means," including but not limited to appending a compound<br>
to a linking group followed by conjugation with an imaging agent chelating group,<br>
refers to means known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Coronary angioplasty is a highly effective procedure used to reduce the severity<br>
of coronary occlusion; however, its long-term success is limited by a high rate of<br>
restenosis. Vascular smooth muscle cell activation, migration and proliferation is<br>
largely responsible for restenosis following angioplasty (Ross, R., Nature, 1993, 362,<br>
801-809).<br>
An aspect of the present invention includes a method for use of av integrin<br>
inhibitor compound of Formula (I) or composition thereof for treating or ameliorating<br>
arterial and venous restenosis; wherein the compound is impregnated on the surface of<br>
a therapeutic device. The term "therapeutic device" refers to, and is not limited to, an<br>
angioplasty balloon, arterial stent, venous stent, suture, artificial joint, implanted<br>
prosthesis or other like medical devices, thus targeting drug delivery to a neoplasm.<br>
An aspect of the present invention includes a composition comprising a<br>
compound of Formula (I), or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in association<br>
with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Compositions contemplated within this<br>
invention can be prepared according to conventional pharmaceutical techniques. A<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier may also (but need not necessarily) be used in the<br>
composition of the invention.<br>
The term "pharmaceutically acceptable" refers to molecular entities and<br>
compositions that do not produce an adverse, allergic or other untoward reaction when<br>
administered to an animal, or a human, as appropriate. Veterinary uses are equally<br>
included within the invention and "pharmaceutically acceptable" formulations include<br>
formulations for both clinical and/or veterinary use.<br>
The composition may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of<br>
preparation desired for administration including, but not limited to, intravenous (both<br>
bolus and infusion), oral, nasal, transdermal, topical with or without occlusion, and<br>
injection intraperitoneally, subcutaneously, intramuscularly, intratumorally or<br>
parenterally, all using forms well known to those of ordinary skill in the pharmaceutical<br>
arts. The composition may comprise a dosage unit such as a tablet, pill, capsule,<br>
powder, granule, sterile parenteral solution or suspension, metered aerosol or liquid<br>
spray, drop, ampoule, auto-injector device or suppository; for administration orally,<br>
parenterally, intranasally, sublingually or rectally or by inhalation or insufflation.<br>
Compositions suitable for oral administration include solid forms such as pills, tablets,<br>
caplets, capsules (each including immediate release, timed release and sustained release<br><br>
formulations), granules and powders; and, liquid forms such as solutions, syrups,<br>
elixirs, emulsions and suspensions. Forms useful for parenteral administration include<br>
sterile solutions, emulsions and suspensions. Alternatively, the composition may be<br>
presented in a form suitable for once-weekly or once-monthly administration; for<br>
example, an insoluble salt of the active compound, such as the decanoate salt, may be<br>
adapted to provide a depot preparation for intramuscular, injection, In preparing the<br>
compositions in oral dosage form, one or more of the usual pharmaceutical carriers may<br>
be employed, including necessary and inert pharmaceutical excipients, such as water,<br>
glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents, syrup and the<br>
like; in the case of oral liquid preparations, carriers such as starches, sugars, diluents,<br>
granulating agents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like may be<br>
employed.<br>
The dosage unit (tablet, capsule, powder, injection, suppository, measured liquid<br>
dosage and the like) containing the pharmaceutical compositions herein will contain an<br>
amount of the active ingredient necessary to deliver a therapeutically effective amount<br>
as described above. The composition may contain from about 0.001 mg to about 5000<br>
mg of the active compound or prodrug thereof and may be constituted into any form<br>
suitable for the mode of administration selected for a subject in need.<br>
An aspect of the present invention contemplates a therapeutically effective<br>
amount in a range of from about 0.001 mg to 1000 mg/kg of body weight per day.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention includes a range of from about 0.001 to about<br>
500 mg/kg of body weight per day. A further aspect of the present invention includes a<br>
range of from about 0.001 to about 300 mg/kg of body weight per day. The compounds<br>
may be administered according to a dosage regimen of from about 1 to about 5 times per<br>
day and still more preferably 1, 2 or 3 times a day.<br>
For oral administration, the compositions are preferably provided in the form of<br>
tablets containing, 0.01,0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 10.0, 15.0, 25.0, 50.0, 100, 150, 200,<br>
250 and 500 milligrams of the active ingredient for the. symptomatic adjustment of the<br>
dosage to the patient to be treated. Optimal dosages to be administered may be readily<br>
determined by those skilled in the art and will vary depending factors associated with<br>
the particular patient being treated (age, weight, diet and time of administration), the<br>
i<br>
severity of the condition being treated,, the compound being employed, the mode of<br>
administration and the strength of the preparation., The use of either daily administration or post-periodic dosing may be employed.<br>
For preparing solid compositions such as tablets, the principal active ingredient<br>
is mixed with a pharmaceutical carrier, e.g. conventional tableting ingredients such as<br>
corn starch, lactose, sucrose, sorbitol, talc, stearic acid, magnesium stearatc, dicalcium<br>
phosphate or gums and other pharmaceutical diluents, e.g. water, to form a solid<br>
preformulation composition containing a homogeneous mixture of a compound of the<br>
present invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. When referring to<br>
these preformulation compositions as homogeneous, it is meant that the active<br>
ingredient is dispersed evenly throughout the composition so that the composition may<br>
be readily subdivided into equally effective dosage forms such as tablets, pills and<br>
capsules. This solid preformulation composition is then subdivided into unit dosage<br>
forms of the type described above containing from 0.001 to about 5000 mg of the active<br>
ingredient of the present invention. The tablets or pills of the composition can be<br>
coated or otherwise compounded to provide a dosage form affording the advantage of<br>
prolonged action. For example, the tablet or pill can comprise an inner dosage and an<br>
outer dosage component, the latter being in the form of an envelope over the former.<br>
The two components can be separated by an enteric layer that serves to resist<br>
disintegration in the stomach and permits the inner component to pass intact into the<br>
duodenum or to be delayed in release. A variety of material can be used for such<br>
enteric layers or coatings, such materials including a number of polymeric acids with<br>
such materials as shellac, acetyl alcohol and cellulose acetate.<br>
For oral administration in the form of a tablet or capsule, the active drug<br>
component can be optionally combined with an oral, non-toxic pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable inert carrier such as ethanol, glycerol, water and the like. Moreover, when<br>
desired or necessary, suitable binders; lubricants, disintegrating agents and coloring<br>
agents can also be incorporated into the mixture. Suitable binders include, without<br>
limitation, starch, gelatin, natural sugars such as glucose or beta-lactose, corn sweeteners,<br>
natural and synthetic gums such as acacia, tragacanth or sodium oleate, sodium stearate,<br>
magnesium stearate, sodium benzoate, sodium acetate, sodium chloride and the like.<br>
Disintegrators include, without limitation, starch, methyl cellulose, agar, bentonite,<br>
xanthan gum and the like.<br>
The liquid forms in which the compound of formula (I) may be incorporated for<br>
administration orally or by injection include, aqueous solutions, suitably flavored<br>
syrups, aqueous or oil suspensions and flavored emulsions with edible oils such as<br>
cottonseed oil, sesame oil, coconut oil or peanut oil, as well as elixirs and similar<br>
pharmaceutical vehicles. Suitable dispersing or suspending agents for aqueous<br>
suspensions, include synthetic and natural gums such as tragacanth, acacia, alginate,<br>
dextran, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, polyvinyl-pyrrolidonc or<br>
gelatin. The liquid forms in suitably flavored suspending or dispersing agents may also<br>
include the synthetic and natural gums, for example, tragacanth, acacia, methyl-cellulose<br>
and the like. For parenteral administration, sterile suspensions and solutions are desired.<br>
Isotonic preparations that generally contain suitable preservatives arc employed when<br>
intravenous administration is desired.<br>
As is also known in the art, the compounds may alternatively be administered<br>
parenterally via injection of a formulation consisting of the active ingredient dissolved<br>
in an inert liquid carrier. The injectable formulation can include the active ingredient<br>
mixed with an appropriate inert liquid carrier. Acceptable liquid carriers include<br>
vegetable oils such as peanut oil, cottonseed oil, sesame oil and the like, as well as<br>
organic solvents such as solketal, glycerol and the like. As an alternative, aqueous<br>
parenteral formulations may also be used. For example, acceptable aqueous solvents<br>
include water, Ringer's solution and an isotonic aqueous saline solution. Further, a<br>
sterile non-volatile oil can usually be employed as a solvent or suspending agent in the<br>
aqueous formulation. The formulations are prepared by dissolving or suspending the<br>
active ingredient in the liquid carrier such that the final formulation contains from<br>
0.005 to 10% by weight of the active ingredient. Other additives including a<br>
preservative, an isotonizer, a solubilizer, a stabilizer and a pain-soothing agent may<br>
adequately be employed.<br>
Advantageously, compounds of Formula (I) may be administered in a single daily<br>
dose, or the total daily dosage may be administered in divided doses of two, three or four<br>
times daily. Furthermore, compounds of the present invention can be administered in<br>
intranasal' form via topical use of suitable intranasal vehicles, or via transdermal routes,<br>
using those forms of transdermal skin patches well known to those of ordinary skill in<br>
that art. To be administered in the form of a transdermal delivery system, the dosage<br>
administration will, of course, be continuous rather than intermittent throughout the<br>
dosage regimen.<br>
Because of their ease of administration, tablets and capsules represent ah<br>
advantageous oral dosage unit form, wherein solid pharmaceutical carriers are<br>
employed. If desired, tablets may be sugarcoated or enteric-coated by standard<br>
techniques. If desired, tablets may be sugar coated or enteric coated by standard<br>
techniques. For parcnterals, the carrier will usually comprise sterile water, though other<br>
ingredients, for example, for purposes such as aiding solubility or for preservation, may<br>
be included. Injectable suspensions may also be prepared, in which case appropriate<br>
liquid carriers, suspending agents and the like may be employed.<br>
The compositions of the present invention also include a composition for slow<br>
release of the compound of the invention. The composition includes a slow release<br>
carrier (typically, a polymeric carrier) and a compound of the invention. In preparation<br>
for slow release, a slow release carrier, typically a polymeric carrier and a compound of<br>
the invention are first dissolved or dispersed in an organic solvent. The obtained<br>
organic solution is then added into an aqueous solution to obtain an oil-in-water-type<br>
emulsion. Preferably, the aqueous solution includes surface-active agent(s).<br>
Subsequently, the organic solvent is evaporated from the oil-in-water-type emulsion to<br>
obtain a colloidal suspension of particles containing the slow release carrier and the<br>
compound of the invention. Slow release biodegradable carriers are also well known in<br>
the art. These are materials that may form particles that capture therein an active<br>
compound(s) and slowly degrade/dissolve under a suitable environment (e.g., aqueous,<br>
acidic, basic, etc) and thereby degrade/dissolve in body fluids and release the active<br>
compound(s) therein. The particles are preferably nanoparticles (i.e., in the range of<br>
about 1 to 500 nm in diameter, preferably about 50-200 nm in diameter and most<br>
preferably about 100 nm in diameter).<br>
The present invention also provides methods to prepare the pharmaceutical<br>
compositions of this invention. A compound of Formula (I) as the active ingredient is<br>
intimately admixed with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional<br>
pharmaceutical compounding techniques, which carrier may take a wide variety of<br>
forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. In preparing the<br>
compositions in oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be<br>
employed. For solid oral dosage forms, suitable carriers and additives include starches,<br>
sugars, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the<br>
like. For liquid oral preparations, suitable carriers and additives include water, glycols,<br>
oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents and the like.<br>
Additionally, liquid forms of the active drug component can be combined in suitably<br>
flavored suspending or dispersing agents such as the synthetic and natural gums,<br>
including for example, tragacanth, acacia, methyl-cellulose and the like. Other<br>
dispersing agents that may be employed include glycerin and the like.<br>
An antibody targeting agent includes antibodies or antigen-binding fragments<br>
thereof, that bind to a targetable or accessible component of a tumor cell, tumor<br>
vasculature or tumor stroma. The "targetable or accessible component" of a tumor cell,<br>
tumor vasculature or tumor stroma, is preferably a surface-expressed, surface-accessible<br>
or surface-localized component. The antibody targeting agents also include antibodies<br>
or antigen-binding fragments thereof, that bind to an intracellular component that is<br>
released from a necrotic tumor cell. Preferably such antibodies are monoclonal<br>
antibodies or antigen-binding fragments thereof that bind to insoluble intracellular<br>
antigen(s) present in cells that may be induced to be permeable or in cell ghosts of<br>
substantially all tumor or normal cells, but are not present or accessible on the exterior<br>
of normal living cells of a mammal.<br>
As used herein, the term "antibody" is intended to refer broadly to any<br>
immunologic binding agent such as IgG, IgM, IgA, IgE, F(ab')2, a univalent fragment<br>
such as Fab', Fab, Dab, as well as engineered antibodies such as recombinant<br>
antibodies, humanized antibodies, bispecific antibodies and the like. The antibody can<br>
be either the polyclonal or the monoclonal, although a monoclonal antibody is<br>
preferred. There is a very broad array of antibodies known in the art that have<br>
immunological specificity for the cell surface of virtually any solid tumor type (see a<br>
Summary Table on monoclonal antibodies for solid tumors in U.S. patent 5,855,866,<br>
Thorpe, et al). Methods are known to those skilled in the art to produce and isolate<br>
antibodies to be used as targeting agents against tumors (U.S. patent 5,855,866,<br>
Thorpe); and, U.S. patent 6,342,219 (Thorpe)).<br>
Non-antibody targeting agents include growth factors that bind specifically to<br>
the tumor vasculature and other targeting components such as annexins and related<br>
ligands. In addition, a variety of other organic molecules can also be used as targeting<br>
agents for tumors, examples are hyaluronan oligosaccharides which specifically<br>
recognize Hyaluronan-binding protein, a cell surface protein expressed during tumor<br>
cell and endothelial cell migration and during capillary-like tubule formation (U.S.<br>
Patent 5,902,795 (Toole, et al.)) and polyanionic compounds, particularly polysulphated<br>
or polysulphonated compounds such as N- and O-sulfated polyanionic polysaccharides,<br>
polystyrene sulfonate and other polyanionic compounds (as described in U.S. Patent<br>
5,762,918 (Thorpe) which selectively bind to vascular endothelial cells.<br>
Techniques for conjugating a therapeutic moiety to antibodies are well known<br>
(Amon, et al., Monoclonal Antibodies For Immunotargeting Of Drugs In Cancer<br>
Therapy, Monoclonal Antibodies And Cancer Therapy, Reisfeld, et al. (eds,), pp. 243-<br>
56 (Alan R. Liss, Inc. 1985); Hellstrom, et al., Antibodies For Drug Delivery,<br>
Controlled Drug Delivery (2nd Ed.), Robinson, et al. (eds.), pp. 623-53 (Marcel<br>
Dekker, Inc. 1987); Thorpe, Antibody Carriers Of Cytotoxic Agents In Cancer Therapy: A Review, Monoclonal Antibodies '84: Biological And Clinical Applications, Pinchera,<br>
et al. (eds.), pp. 475-506 (1985). Similar technique's can also be applied to attach<br>
compounds of the invention to non-antibody targeting agents. Those skilled in the art<br>
will know or be able to select methods in the art for forming conjugates with non-<br>
antibody targeting agents, such as oligopeptides, polysaccharides or other polyanionic<br>
compounds.<br>
Although any linking moiety that is reasonably stable in blood can be used to<br>
link the compound of the invention to the targeting agen,t, those with biologically-<br>
releasable bonds and/or selectively cleavable spacers or linkers are preferred.<br>
"Biologically-releasable bonds" and "selectively cleavable spacers or linkers" refers to<br>
those linking moieties which have reasonable stability in the circulation and are<br>
releasable, cleavable or hydrolyzable only or preferentially under certain conditions,<br>
(i.e., within a certain environment or in contact with a particular agent). Such bonds<br>
include, for example, disulfide and trisulfide bonds and acid-labile bonds (as described<br>
in U.S. Patent 5,474,765 and 5,762,918) and enzyme-sensitive bonds, including peptide<br>
bonds, esters, amides, phosphodiesters and glycosides (as described in U.S. Patent<br>
5,474,765 and 5,762,918). Such selective-release design features facilitate sustained<br>
release of the compounds from the conjugates at the intended target site.<br>
The therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention conjugated<br>
to a targeting agent depends on the individual, the disease type, the disease state, the<br>
method of administration and other clinical variables. The effective amount is readily<br>
determinable using data from an animal model. Experimental animals bearing solid<br>
tumors are frequently used to optimize appropriate therapeutically effective amounts<br>
prior to translating to a clinical environment. Such models are known to be very<br>
reliable in predicting effective anti-cancer strategies. For example, mice bearing solid<br>
tumors are widely used in pre-clinical testing to determine working ranges of<br>
therapeutic agents that give beneficial anti-tumor effects with minimal toxicity.<br>
The present invention further provides a composition that comprises an<br>
effective amount of the compound of the invention conjugated to a targeting agent and<br>
a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. When proteins such as antibodies or growth<br>
factors, or polysaccharides are used as targeting agents, they are preferably administered<br>
in the form of injectable compositions. The injectable antibody solution will be<br>
administered into a vein, artery or into the spinal fluid over the course of from about 2<br>
minutes to about 45 minutes, preferably from about 10 to about 20 minutes. In certain<br>
cases, intradermal and intracavitary administration are advantageous for tumors<br>
restricted to areas close to particular regions of the|Skin and/or to particular body<br>
cavities. In addition, intrathecal administrations may be used for tumors located in the<br>
brain.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention includes a method for treating or<br>
disorders related to av integrin expression (in particular, restenosis, intimal hyperplasia<br>
or inflammation in vessel walls) in a subject in need thereof comprising administering<br>
to the subject by controlled delivery a therapeutically effective amount of a compound<br>
of Formula (I) or composition thereof coated onto an intraluminal medical device (in<br>
particular, a balloon-catheter or stent). Such devices are useful to prevent the<br>
occurrence of restenosis by inhibiting av integrin activity and thus preventing<br>
hyperproliferation of the endothelium.<br>
The term "intraluminal medical device" refers to any delivery device, such as<br>
intravascular drug delivery catheters, wires, pharmacological stents and endoluminal<br>
paving. The scope of the present invention includes delivery devices comprising an<br>
arterial or venous stent having a coating or sheath which elutes or releases a<br>
therapeutically effective amount of an instant compound. The term "controlled<br>
delivery" refers to the release of active ingredient in a site-directed and time dependent<br>
manner. Alternatively, the delivery system for such a device may comprise a local<br>
infusion catheter that delivers the compound at a variably controlled rate.<br>
The term "stent" refers to any device capable of being delivered by a catheter.<br>
A stent is routinely used to prevent vascular closure due to physical anomalies such as<br>
unwanted inward growth of vascular tissue due to surgical trauma. A stent often has a<br>
tubular, expanding lattice-type structure appropriate to be left inside the lumen of a duct<br>
to relieve an obstruction. The stent has a lumen wall-contacting surface and a lumen-<br>
exposed surface. The lumen-wall contacting surface is the outside surface of the tube<br>
and the lumen-exposed surface is the inner surface of the tube. The stent material may<br>
be a polymeric, metallic or a combination polymeric-metallic material and can be<br>
optionally biodegradable.<br>
Commonly, a stent is inserted into the lumen in a non-expanded form and are<br>
then expanded autonomously, or with the aid of a second device in situ. A typical<br>
method of expansion occurs thr.ough the use of a catheter-mounted angioplastry balloon<br>
which is inflated within the stenosed vessel or body passageway in order to shear and<br>
disrupt the obstructions associated with the wall components of the vessel and to obtain<br>
an enlarged lumen. Self-expanding stents as described in pending U.S. Patent<br>
application 2002/0016625 Al (Falotico, et al.) may also be utilized. The combination<br>
of a stent with drugs, agents or compounds which prevent inflammation and<br>
proliferation may provide the most efficacious treatment for post-angioplastry<br>
restenosis.<br>
Compounds of the present invention can be incorporated into or affixed to the<br>
stent in a number of ways. A solution of the compound of the invention and a<br>
biocompatiblc material or polymer may be incorporated into or onto a stent in a number<br>
of ways. For example, a solution of an instant compound may be sprayed onto the stent<br>
or the stent may be dipped into the solution and, in each case, allowed to dry. Another<br>
coating method electrically charges a solution of an instant compound to one polarity<br>
and charges the stent to the opposite polarity. In this manner, the solution and stent will<br>
be attracted to one another. Another method coats the stent with a solution of an instant<br>
compound using supercritical temperature and pressure conditions. Coating the stent<br>
using supercritical conditions reduces waste and allows more control over the thickness<br>
of the coat may be achieved. The compound is usually only affixed to the outer surface<br>
of the stent (the surface which makes contact with the tissue), but for some compounds,<br>
the entire stent may be coated.<br>
A combination product comprising a therapeutically effective amount of an<br>
instant compound coated on the stent and on or in a layer or layers of a polymer coating<br>
wherein the polymer coating controls the release rate of the drug may be used when the<br>
effectiveness of the drug is affected. Accordingly., the compound may be released from<br>
the stent over a period of at least about 6 months; in another aspect, over a period of<br>
about 3 days to about 6 months; and, in another aspect over a period of about 7 to about<br>
i<br>
30 days. Any number of non-erodible,, biocompatible polymeric materials may be used<br>
for the polymer coating layer or layers in conjunctipn with the compound of the<br>
invention.<br>
In one illustration, the compound is directly incorporated into a polymeric<br>
matrix, such as the polymer polypyrrole and subsequently coated onto the outer surface<br>
of the stent. Essentially, the compound elutes from the matrix by diffusion through the<br>
polymer molecules. Stents and methods for coating drugs on stents are discussed in<br>
detail in PCT application WO 96/32907. In another aspect, the stent is first coated with<br>
as a base layer comprising a solution of the compound, ethylene-co-vinylacetate and<br>
polybutylmethacrylate. The stent is then further coated with an outer layer comprising<br>
polybutylmethacrylate. The outlayer acts as a diffusion barrier to prevent the<br>
compound from eluting too quickly and entering the surrounding tissues. The thickness<br>
of the outer layer or topcoat determines the rate at which the compound elutes from the<br>
matrix. Stents and methods for coating are discussed in detail in pending U.S. Patent<br>
application 2002/0016625 Al.<br>
It is important to note that different polymers may be utilized for different<br>
stents. For example, the above-described ethylene-co-vinylacetate and<br>
polybutylmethacrylate matrix works well with stainless steel stents. Other polymers<br>
may be utilized more effectively with stents formed from other materials, including<br>
materials that exhibit superelastic properties such as alloys of nickel and titanium or<br>
shape-retentive polymeric materials that "remember" and return to their original shape<br>
upon activation at body temperature.<br>
Methods for introducing a stent into a lumen of a body are well known. In an<br>
aspect of this invention, a compound-coated stent is introduced using a catheter. As<br>
will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art, methods will vary slightly based<br>
on the location of stent implantation. For coronary'stent implantation,1 the balloon<br>
catheter bearing the stent is inserted into the coronary artery and the stent is positioned<br>
at the desired site. The balloon is inflated, expanding the stent. As the stent expands,<br>
the stent contacts the lumen wall. Once the stent is positioned, the balloon is deflated<br>
and removed. The stent remains in place with the lumen-contacting surface bearing the<br>
compound directly contacting the lumen wall surface. Stent implantation may be<br>
accompanied by anticoagulation therapy as needed.<br>
Optimum conditions for delivery of the compounds for use in the stent of the<br>
invention may vary with the different local delivery systems used, as well as the<br>
properties and concentrations of the compounds used. Conditions that may be<br>
optimized include, for example, the concentrations of the compounds, the delivery<br>
volume, the delivery rate, the depth of penetration of the vessel wall, the proximal<br>
inflation pressure, the amount and size of perforations and the fit of the drug delivery<br>
catheter balloon. Conditions may be optimized for inhibition of smooth muscle cell<br>
proliferation at the site of injury such that significant arterial blockage due to restenosis<br>
does not occur, as measured, for example, by the proliferative ability of the smooth<br>
muscle cells or by changes in the vascular resistance or lumen diameter. Optimum<br>
conditions can be determined based on data from animal model studies using routine<br>
computational methods.<br>
The compounds of the present invention can also be administered in the form of<br>
liposome delivery systems, such as small unilamellar vesicles, large unilamellar<br>
vesicles and multilamellar vesicles. Liposomes containing delivery systems as well<br>
known in the art are formed from a variety of phospholipids, such as cholesterol,<br>
stearylamine or phosphatidylcholines.<br>

formation of a propargylic alcohol Compound D3. The alkyne Compound D3 was<br>
selectively reduced to a cis-olefin Compound D4 under hydrogenolysis conditions using<br>
Lindlar's catalyst in pyridine. Condensation of the allylic alcohol Compound D4 with<br>
an Ra substituted 3-chloro-3-oxopropionate Compound D5 in the presence of a base<br>
such as TEA, DIEA or the like resulted in the formation of a mixed ester Compound<br>

suitable base such as sodium hydride, potassium hydride, LDA or the like gave rise to<br>
an intermediate silyl ketene acetal which rearranged upon heating in a suitable solvent<br>
such as THF or Et2O to a mixed ester Compound D7. Decarboxylation of the ester<br>
Compound D7 to form Compound D8 was accomplished upon heating Compound D7<br>
