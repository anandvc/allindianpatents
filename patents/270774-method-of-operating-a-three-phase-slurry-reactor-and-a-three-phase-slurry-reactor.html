				<td>THIS INVENTION relates to a method of operating a three-phase slurry<br>
reactor and to a three-phase slurry reactor.<br>
Considerable risk is encountered When technology is scaled up from pilot<br>
plant scale to commercial plant seals in order to reap the benefits of economy of scale.<br>
Three-phase slurry reactors typically exhibit scale-dependent macro-mixing effects and<br>
the aforementioned risk is thus applicable when three-phase slurry reactors are scaled<br>
up. It will thus be an advantage If a method can be found which can significantly reduce<br>
the risk associated with upscalling of three-phase slurry reactors. !n addition, reactor<br>
designs in which the mixing patterns inside the reactor can be more readily modelled or<br>
predicted from experimentation have the benefit trial the extent of usually undesirable<br>
back-mixing can be limited thereby potentially allowing an optimal combination of<br>
desirable plug-flow characteristics (usually good productivity and good selectivity) and<br>
well-mixed characteristics (often required for desirable solids distribution and even<br>
temperature profiles).<br>
A solution that has been proposed is to create zones in the reactor that<br>
effectively mimic the behaviour of a reactor with a smaller characteristic diameter. In<br>
this mariner the behaviour of tha large scale reactor can be predicted to some extent,<br>
since it effectively consists of the sum of s number of smaller reactors of effectively pilot<br>
plant scale. However, one is still largely dependent on working within the bounds of the<br>
macro-mixing patterns that are established in the reactor with a smaller characteristic<br>
diameter. It would thus be an advantage if a method can be found that allows designers<br>
additional degrees of freedom to, at least to some extent, control the mixing patterns<br>
that are established in a three-phase slurry reactor.<br>
2<br><br>
Three-phase slurry readers are commonly used for highly exothermic<br>
reactions due to their excellent heat removal characteristics. However, with the<br>
introduction of ever more active catalysts and more intensive use of reactor volume,<br>
even the heat removal ability of three-phase slurry reactors is being tested.<br>
In light of what has been said before, it will thus be an advantage if a method<br>
can be found which significantly reduces the risk associated with upscaling of three-<br>
phase slurry reactors by allowing the designer additional degrees of freedom to exert<br>
some control over the mixing patterns in the reactor, white simultaneously increasing<br>
the heat removal ability of the reactor.<br>
The Applicant is aware of US 6,375,921 which relates to a bubble column for<br>
counter-current operations using perforated trays. This document discloses that it may<br>
be possible to use plate heat exchangers inside the bubble column. US 6,375,921<br>
however provides no teaching regarding the problem of upscaling of three-phase slurry<br>
reactors with continuous vertically extending slurry bodies.<br>
The Applicant is also aware of WO 02/096835. This document discloses a<br>
process for the conversion of synthesis gas to higher hydrocarbons in a slurry body,<br>
High shear mixing is used so that a reactor in which the process is used, can be<br>
regarded as a continuous stirred tank reactor, WO 02/096835 provides no teaching<br>
regarding the problem of upscaling of three-phase slurry reactors with continuous<br>
vertically extending slurry bodies operating in plug flow fashion.<br>
According to one aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of<br>
operating a three-phase slurry reactor, the method Including<br>
feeding at a low level at least one gaseous reactant into a vertically extending<br>
slurry body of solid particles suspended In a suspension liquid, the slurry body being<br>
contained in a plurality of vertically extending horizontally spaced slurry channels inside<br>
a common reactor shell, the slurry channels being defined between vertically extending<br>
horizontally spaced divider walls or plates and each slurry channel having a height,<br>
width and breadth such that the height and breadth are much larger than the width;<br>
3<br><br>
allowing the gaseous reactant to react as it passes upwardly through the slurry<br>
body present in the slurry channel thereby to form non-gaseous and/or gaseous<br>
product;<br>
allowing gaseous product and/or unreacted gaseous reactant to disengage from<br>
the slurry body in a head space abova the slurry body;<br>
withdrawing gaseous product and/or unreacted gaseous reactant from the head<br>
space; and<br>
if necessary, maintaining the slurry body at a desired level by withdrawing slurry or<br>
suspension liquid, including non-gaseous product if present, or by adding slurry or<br>
suspension liquid.<br>
The method may include allowing slurry to pass downwardly from a high level<br>
in the slurry body to a lower level thereof, using one or more downcomer zones or<br>
downcomers inside the reactor shell.<br>
At least some of the slurry Channels may be in slurry flow communication<br>
above upper ends of the slurry channels.<br>
The divider walls or plates of at least some of the slurry channels may<br>
separate said slurry channels from adjacent heat transfer medium flow spaces. The<br>
method may include passing a heat transfer medium through the heat transfer medium<br>
flow spaces to exchange heat In indirect relationship with the slurry body present in the<br>
slurry channels.<br>
Heat transfer surfaces of the reactor, such as those of the divider walls or<br>
plates, may optionally be shaped or textured to increase their heat transfer surface area<br>
or to improve heat transfer coefficients compared to those of smooth divider walls or<br>
plates. The shaping or texturing may include, amongst other methods known to<br>
persons skilled in the art, the uae of dimpled, ribbed or finned walls or platss.<br>
According to a second aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of<br>
operating a three-phase slurry reactor, the method including<br>
feeding at a low level at least one gaseous reactant into a vertically extending<br>
slurry body of solid particles suspended in a suspension liquid, the slurry body being<br>
4<br><br>
contained in a plurality of vertically extending horizontally spaced slurry channels inside<br>
a common reactor shell, at least some of the slurry channels being in slurry flow<br>
communication above open upper ends of the slurry channels and at least some of the<br>
slurry channels being defined by walls separating the slurry channels from a heat<br>
transfer medium flow space or spaces;<br>
allowing the gaseous reactant to react as It passes upwardly through the slurry<br>
body present in the slurry channels, thereby to form a non-gaseous and/or a gaseous<br>
product;<br>
passing a. heat transfer medium through the heat transfer medium flow space or<br>
spaces to exchange heat in indirect relationship with the slurry body present in the<br>
slurry channels;<br>
allowing slurry to pass downwardly from a high level in the slurry body to a lower<br>
level thereof, using one or more downcomer zones or downcomers inside the reactor<br>
shell;<br>
allowing gaseous product and/or unreacted gaseous reactant to disengage from<br>
the slurry body in a head space above the slurry body;<br>
withdrawing gaseous product and/or unreacted gaseous reactant from the head<br>
space; and<br>
if necessary, maintaining the slurry body at a desired level by withdrawing slurry or<br>
suspension liquid, including non-gaseous product if present, or by adding slurry or<br>
suspension liquid.<br>
The slurry channels are preferably isolated from each other between their<br>
open upper ends and open lower ends, and are preferably separated from each other<br>
by heat transfer medium flow spaces. In other words, the method preferably includes<br>
preventing slurry flow communication at all elevations between the open upper ends,<br>
and lower ends of the slurry channels, so that the slurry channels are discrete, defining<br>
completely Individualised reaction chambers.<br>
The slurry channels used in the method according to the second aspect of<br>
the invention may be defined by vertically extending tubes between tube sheets, with<br>
the heat transfer medium flow space being defined between the tubs sheets and<br>
surrounding the tubes. The tubes typical ly have diameters of at least about 10 cm.<br>
5<br><br>
instead, the slurry channels may' be defined by vertically extending<br>
horizontally spaced divider wails or plates, with heat transfer medium flow spaces also<br>
being defined between vertically extending horizontally spaced divider wails or plates, at<br>
least some of the slurry channels being separated from adjacent heat transfer medium<br>
flow spaces by common or shared divider walls or plates.<br>
The divider walls or plates may be parallel to each other, defining slurry<br>
channels and heat transfer medium flow spaces with a height, width and breadth such<br>
that the height and breadth are typically much larger than the width. In other words,<br>
each divider wait has a height and a breadth which are substantial, a relatively small<br>
thickness and is spaced relatively closely from an adjacent divider wall, thereby defining<br>
vertically extending paralleltptpedal channels or spaces with one dimension much<br>
smaller than the other two dimensions.<br>
Haat transfer surfaces of the reactor, such as those of the divider walls or<br>
plates or tubes, may optionally be shaped or textured to increase their heat transfer<br>
surface area or to improve heat transfer coefficients compared to those of smooth<br>
divider walls or smooth cylindrical tubes. The shaping or texturing may include,<br>
amongst other methods known to persons skilled in the art, the use of dimpled, ribbed<br>
or finned walls or plates or tubes.<br>
When the slurry channels are defined by divider walls, the slurry and heat<br>
transfer medium may be present In slurry channels and hast transfer medium flow<br>
spaces that are arranged alternately. Each slurry channel may thus be -flanked by, or<br>
sandwiched between, two heat transfer medium How spaces, except possibly for radially<br>
outer slurry channels.<br>
The downward flow of slurry in the downcomer zones or downcomers may be<br>
sufficiently high that there is substantially no downward flow of slurry in the slurry<br>
channels.<br>
While it is believed that the method can, at least in principle, have broader<br>
application, it is envisaged that the solid particles will normally be catalyst particles for<br>
catalysing the reaction of the gaseous reactant or gaseous reactants into a liquid<br>
6<br><br>
product and/or a gaseous product. The suspension liquid will normally, but not<br>
necessarily always, be liquid product, with liquid phase or slurry thus being withdrawn<br>
from the slurry body to maintain the slurry body at a desired level.<br>
Furthermore, while jt is also believed that, in principle, "the method can have<br>
broader application, it is envisaged that it will have particular application in hydrocarbon<br>
synthesis where the gaseous reactants are capable of reacting catalytically<br>
exothermically in the slurry body to form liquid hydrocarbon product and, optionally,<br>
gaseous hydrocarbon product. In particular, the reaction or hydrocarbon synthesis may<br>
be FIscher-Tropsch synthesis, with the gaseous reactants being in the form of a<br>
synthesis gas stream comprising mainly carbon monoxide and hydrogen, and with both<br>
liquid and gaseous hydrocarbon products being produced and the heat transfer medium<br>
being a cooling medium, e.g, bo tier feed water.<br>
For hydrocarbon synthesis, the slurry channels will typically have a height of<br>
at least 0.5 m, preferably at bast 1 m, more preferably at least 2 m, but may even be<br>
4 m or higher. The slurry channels will typically have a width of at least 2 em, preferably<br>
at least 36 cm, more preferably at least 5 cm. The width of the slurry channels will<br>
typically not exceed BO cm, more preferably the width will not exceed 25 cm, more<br>
preferably the width will not exceed 13 cm. The slurry channels will typically have a<br>
breadth in the range of approximately 0.2 m to 1 m. The reactor shell will typically have<br>
a diameter of at least 1 m, preferably at least 2.5 m, more preferably at least 5 m, but<br>
one should note that an object of the invention is to neutralise the effect of reactor<br>
diameter on the reactor behaviour.<br>
As will be appreciated, each slurry channel, whether defined between divider<br>
walls or defined by a tube, functions independently from the reactor shell and can be<br>
configured to function to a large extent independently from other slurry channels.<br>
Design and testing of a single slurry channel or a small subgroup of slurry channels on<br>
a pilot scale is feasible, with scale-up to s commercial scale reactor comprising a<br>
plurality of the slurry channels then becoming quite easy and being less risky, provided<br>
scale-dependent macro-mixing effects are managed property.<br>
7<br><br>
Furthermore, when downcomers or downcomer zones are employed with a<br>
sufficient downward slurry flow such that there is substantially no downward flow of<br>
slurry in the slurry channels, the establishment of a macro-mixing pattern, other than<br>
that dictated by the defined downflow and upflow zones, over the reactor is practically<br>
Impossible.<br>
The method may include cooling the gas from the head space to condense<br>
liquid product, e.g. liquid hydrocarbons and reaction water, separating the liquid product<br>
from the gases to provide a tall gas, and recycling at bast some of the tail gas to the<br>
slurry body as a recycle gas stream.<br>
Vertically extending, horizontally disposed reactor zones may be defined<br>
Inside the reactor shell, where each horizantally disposed reactor zone includes a<br>
plurality of slurry channels and optionally one or more heat transfer medium flow<br>
spaces. The method may include preventing slurry flow communication between<br>
adjacent vertically extending, horizontally disposed reactor zones and at all elevations<br>
between upper and lower open ends of the slurry channels in a horizontally disposed<br>
reactor zone. This may be achieved, for example, by providing the horizontally<br>
disposed reactor zones with vertically extending side walls, or by arranging the divider<br>
walls in adjacent horizontally disposed reactor zones at perpendicular angles so that an<br>
end divider wall in one of the horizontally disposed reactor zones In effect forms a side<br>
wall for the adjacent horizontally disposed reactor zone.<br>
The method may Include containing the slurry body in vertically spaced<br>
reactor zones each Including a plurality of slurry channels and optionally one or more<br>
heat transfer medium flow spaces. An intermediate slurry zone may bo defined<br>
between vertically spaced reactor zones.<br>
The method may include feeding at least one gaseous stream into sn<br>
intermediate zone between two vertically spaced reactor zones. The gaseous stream<br>
may be a recycle gas stream. If desired, the gaseous stream may be fed such that a<br>
portion of the cross-sectional area of the reactor is not gassed with the gaseous stream.<br>
8<br><br>
One or more of the downcomer zones or downcomers may extend from at or<br>
above the open upper ends of the slurry channels, or slurry channels in an upper<br>
vertically spaced reactor zone, to at or below open lower ends of the slurry channels, or<br>
slurry channels in a bottom vertically spaced reactor zone.<br>
instead, one or more of the downcomer zones or downcomers may extend<br>
from at or above the open upper ends of the slurry channels of a vertically spaced<br>
reactor zone, to at or below open lower ends of the slurry channels of said vertically<br>
spaced reactor zone, often into an intermediate zone below said vertically spaced<br>
reactor zone. A lower or higher vertically spaced reactor zons may include a similar<br>
downcomer zone or downcomer, Which may be staggered In plan view from the<br>
downcomer zone or downcomer in the vertically spaced reactor zone above or below, or<br>
Which may be in register with the downcomer zone or downcomer In the vertically<br>
spaced reactor zone above or below.<br>
If desired, s downcomer zone may include a heat transfer medium flow<br>
space or spaces, and/or a fitter to separate solid particles from the suspension liquid.<br>
Allowing slurry to pass downwardly in a downcomer zone or downcomer may<br>
include preventing or inhibiting gaseous reactant or reactants from entering the<br>
downcomer zone, e.g. by providing a baffle, and/or It may include degassing tine slurry<br>
in the downcomer zone or downcomer, e.g. by providing a degasser at an upper end of<br>
the downcomer zone or downcomer.<br>
The method may include allowing slurry flow communication between<br>
horizontally disposed reactor zones in one or more of the intermediate zones, and/or in<br>
the bottom of the reactor below the open lower ends of slurry channels.<br>
The method may include limiting the axial mixing of the solid particles over<br>
the entire reactor length. This can be achieved through the selection of vertically<br>
spaced reaction zones and downcomers spanning the length of a single reaction zor.e.<br>
According to a third aspect of the invention, there is provided a three-phasa<br>
slurry reactor, the reactor including<br>
9<br><br>
a reactor shell containing a plurality of vertically extending horizontally spaced<br>
slurry channels which, in use. will contain a slurry of solid particles suspended in a<br>
suspension liquid, the slurry channels being defined between vertically extending<br>
horizontally spaced divider walls or plates and each slurry channel having a height,<br>
width and breadth such that the height and breadth are much larger than the width;<br>
a gas inlet in the reactor shell for introducing a gaseous reactant or gaseous<br>
reactants into the reactor; and<br>
a gas outlet in the shell for withdrawing gas from a head space in the shell above<br>
the slurry channels.<br>
At least some of the divider walls or plates may define heat transfer medium<br>
flow spaces or channels. The heat transfer medium flow channels may also have a<br>
height, breadth and width such that the height and breadth are much larger than the<br>
width.<br>
Heat transfer surfaces of the reactor, such as those of this divider walls or<br>
plates, may optionally be shaped or textured to increase their heat transfer surface area<br>
or to improve heat transfer coefficients. The shaping or texturing may include, amongst<br>
other methods known to persons skilled In the art, the use of dimpled, ribbed or finned<br>
walls or plates.<br>
The channels may be as hereinbefore described.<br>
The slurry channels are thus located In a slurry zone inside the reactor shell.<br>
The slurry zone may have a normal slurry level above open upper ends of the slurry<br>
channels so that at least some of the slurry channels may be in slurry flow<br>
communication shove their open upper ends.<br>
The reactor may include one or more downcomer zones or downcomers, in<br>
use through which slurry can pass from a high level in the slurry zone to a lower level<br>
thereof.<br>
According to a fourth aspect of the invention, there is provided a three-phase<br>
slurry reactor, the reactor including<br>
10<br><br>
a reactor shell containing a plurality of vertical ty extending horizontally spaced<br>
slurry channels which, in use. will contain a slurry of solid particles suspended in a<br>
suspension liquid, the slurry channels being located in a slurry zone inside the -reactor<br>
shell which has a normal slurry level above open upper ends of the slurry channels so<br>
that ai least some of the slurry channels are In slurry flow communication above their<br>
open ends;<br>
a heat transfer medium flow space or spaces defined by walls of the slurry<br>
channels separating the slurry channels from the heat transfer medium flow space or<br>
spaces so that in use heat transfer in indirect heat transfer relationship can taks place<br>
between slurry in the slurry channels and a heat transfer madium in the heat transfer<br>
medium How space or spaces;<br>
ons or more downcomer zones or downcomers through which slurry can pass<br>
from a high level in the slurry zone to a lower level thereof;<br>
a gas inlet in the reactor shell for Introducing a gaseous reactant or gaseous<br>
reactants into the reactor;<br>
a gas outlet in the shell for withdrawing gas from a head space in the shell above<br>
the slurry channels; and<br>
if necessary, a liquid Inlet for adding or withdrawing slurry or suspension liquid to<br>
or from the reactor.<br>
At least some of the slurry channels may be in slurry flow communication<br>
below open lower ends of the slurry channels. The slurry channels may have walls<br>
configured to prevent slurry flow from or into the slurry channels other than through<br>
open upper and lower ends of the slurry channels. In other words: the walls typically<br>
prevent radial or transverse slurry flow between slurry channels, so that the slurry<br>
channels are completely Individualised reaction chambers.<br>
The slurry channels In the reactor according to the fourth aspect of the<br>
invention may be defined by Vertically extending tubes between tube sheets, With the<br>
heat transfer medium flow space being defined between the tubes sheets and<br>
surrounding the tubes. The tubes typically have diameters of at least about 10 cm.<br>
Instead, the slurry channels may be defined by vertically extending<br>
horizontally spaced divider walls or plates, with the heat transfer medium flow spaces<br>
11<br><br>
also being defined between vertically extending horizontally spaced divider walls or<br>
plates, at least some slurry channels being separated from adjacent heat transfer<br>
medium flow spaces by common or shared divider walls or plates.<br>
The divider walla or plate3 may be parallel to each other, defining slurry<br>
channels and heat transfer medium flow spaces as hereinbefore described. Typically,<br>
the divider walls or plates correspona with chords of the circular cylindrical reactor shell,<br>
when seen in plan view.<br>
When the slurry channels are defined by divider walls, the slurry channels<br>
and heat transfer medium flow spaces may be alternately arranged. Each slurry<br>
channel may thus be flanked by, or sandwiched between, two heat transfer medium<br>
flow spaces, except possibly for radially outer slurry channels.<br>
Heat transfer surfaces of the reactor, such as those of the divider walls or<br>
plates or tubes, may optionally be shaped or textured to increase their heat transfer<br>
surface area or to improve heat transfer coefficients compared to those of smooth<br>
divider walls or smooth cylindrical tubes. The shaping or texturing may include,<br>
amongst other methods known to persons skilled In the art, the use of dimpled, ribbed<br>
or finned wails or plates or tubes.<br>
The slurry channels, optionally together with one or more heat transfer<br>
medium flow spaces, may be grouped together in reactor modules or sub-reactors.<br>
Sub-reactors may be horizontally disposed across the cross-sectional area of the<br>
reactor shell. A sub-reactor may have vertically extending side walls separating It from<br>
an adjacent horizontally spaced sub-reactor. The vertically extending side wall may be<br>
configured to prevent slurry flow communication between adjacent horizontally disposed<br>
sub-reactors at all elevations between upper and lower open ends of the slurry channels<br>
of the adjacent horizo ntally disposad sub-reactors,<br>
The slurry channels of horizontally disposed or horizontally spaced adjacent<br>
sub-reactors may each have a breadth axis, when the slurry channels are defined by<br>
divider walls or plates, with the breadth axes of the slurry channels of adjacent<br>
horizontally disposed sub-reactors being parallel, instead, the breadth axes of adjacent<br>
12<br><br>
horizontally disposed sub-reactors may be perpendicular. In such an embodiment, an<br>
end divider wall of a sub-reactor may thus form a side wall separating the sub-reactor<br>
from a horizontally disposed adjacent sub-reactor.<br>
The reactor may include reactor modules or sub-reactors which are vertically<br>
spaced, with the open upper ends of the slurry channels of a lower sub-reactor or sub-<br>
reactors being below the open lower ends of the slurry channels of an upper sub-reactor<br>
or sub-reactors.<br>
The reactor may Include; an intermediate zone between upper sub-reactor(s)<br>
and lower sub-reactor(s). The intermediate zone may bo in flow communication with<br>
slurry channels of an upper sub-reactor or sub-reactors and with slurry channels of a<br>
lower sub-reactor or sub-reactors, in other words, transverse or horizontal flow or<br>
mixing of slurry in the intermediate zone may be allowed by having the intermediate<br>
zone free of barriers which would prevent transverse flow between open ends of slurry<br>
channels opening out into the intermediate zone.<br>
The reactor may include a gas inlet into an Intermediate zone between upper<br>
and lower sub-reactors. The gas Inlet may be a recycle gas inlet. The gas inlet may be<br>
configured to introduce gas only into a portion of the cross-sectional area of the reactor<br>
shell. In other words, the gas Inlet may be arranged In use to gas only a selected cross-<br>
sectional region of the reactor, e.g. only certain sub-reactors or certain slurry channels.<br>
One or more downcomer zones or downcomers may extend from at or above<br>
the open upper ends of the slurry channels, or the slurry channels of an upper sub-<br>
reactor, to at or below open lower ends of the slurry channels, or slurry channels of a<br>
lower sub-reactor.<br>
Instead, one or more of the downcomer zones or downcomers may extend<br>
from at or above the open upper ends of the slurry channels in a sub-reactor, to at or<br>
below open lower ends of the slurry channels of said sub-reactor, often into an<br>
intermediate ZONE below said sub-reactor Downcomer zones or downcamers of<br>
vertically spaced sub-reactors may be staggered in plan view, or may be in register.<br>
13<br><br>
A downcorner or downcomer zone may be defined by slurry channels<br>
adapted to function as a downcomer or downcomer zone. Such an adapted slurry<br>
channel may have or may be associated with a gassing prevention device, e.g. a baffle,<br>
or it may have or it may be associated with a degasser at an upper end thereof.<br>
A downcomer zone or downcomer may include a heat transfer medium flow<br>
space or spaces and/or it may include a filter.to separate solid particles from<br>
suspension liquid.<br>
The heat transfer medium flow spaces, when in the form of channels, are<br>
close-ended, and are provided with heat transfer medium inlet and outlet arrangements.<br>
The heat transfer medium inlet and outlet arrangements may open out into the channels<br>
through their dosed ends, i.e. axially or vertically, or the heat transfer medium flow<br>
channels or spaces may be in flow communication transversely or horizontally,<br>
reminiscent of a plate heat exchanger in which every second flew space is In flow<br>
communication, whilst being sealed from intervening flow spaces.<br>

Referring to Figure 1 of the drawings, reference numeral 10 generally<br>
indicates one embodiment of a three-phase slurry reactor in accordance with the<br>
invention. The reactor 10 includes a reactor shell 12 which houses a plurality of<br>
vertically extending, horizontally spaced parallel divider walls or plates 14. The plates<br>
14 define a plurality of slurry channels 16.<br>
The shell 12 is circular cylindrical and the plates 14 correspond with or fall on<br>
chords of the shell 12, when viewed in plan. Each slurry channel 16 has a relatively<br>
small width, la. the spacing between the plates 14, compared to its height and its<br>
breadth, where its breadth Is taken along an axis perpendicular to the page on which<br>
the drawing is shown.<br>
Although not shown in the drawings, at least some of the divider walls or<br>
plates 14 may be shaped or textured to increase their heat transfer surface area or to<br>
improve heat transfer coefficients. The shaping or texturing may Include, amongst other<br>
methods known to persons skilled tn the art, the use of dimpled, ribbed or Finned wails<br>
or plates.<br>
The reactor 10 also includes a gas inlet 18 leading into a sparger<br>
arrangement 20 below the slurry channels 16. A gas outlet 22 is provided which i$ In<br>
flow communication with a head space 24 above the slurry channel 16, A liquid outlet<br>
15<br><br>
26 leads from a bottom of the reactor 10. below the slimy channels 16, but can be at<br>
any convenient level.<br>
The reactor 10 has a slurry zone extending from the bottom of the reactor 10<br>
to a normal slurry level Indicated by reference numerals 28 and 30. As can be seen in<br>
Figure 1, the normal slurry level 28 can thus either be below the open upper ends of the<br>
slurry channels 16, or the normal slurry level 30 may be above the open upper ends of<br>
the slurry channels 16, thereby In use completely submerging the platea 14.<br>
 In a slurry reactor such as the reactor 10, there would be limited or<br>
substantially no interaction between the slurry channels 16 where they open out into the<br>
bottom of the reactor 10. Reaction spaces, defined by the slurry channels 16, are<br>
essentially two-dimensional and if the slurry channels are operated essentially<br>
independent of each other the dependency upon the diameter of the reactor shell 12<br>
largely or completely disappears. This facilitates scale-up, as a representative unit,<br>
consisting of one or a few slurry channels, can be studied separately and independently<br>
from commercial scale reactor dimensions.<br>
When the plates 14 are not fully submerged In the slurry body, la. when th9<br>
normal slurry level is the level 26, the reactor 10 essentially behaves as a stack of<br>
parallel, vertically extending two-dimensional three-phase slurry columns. Differences<br>
between these two-dimensional columns and conventional three-dimensional columns,<br>
relating to mixing, gas hold-up and heat and mass transfer, may be used<br>
advantageously.<br>
For fully submerged plates 14, when the normal slurry level is indicated by<br>
the level 30, even more opportunities present themselves. .A slurry circulation flow<br>
pattern over the slurry channels 15 can be established, allowing for better plug flow<br>
characteristics for the phases in the slurry channels 16, a more uniform solids<br>
distribution throughout the slurry and higher heat transfer coefficients (reactors with heat<br>
transfer arrangements will be discussed in more detail later on).<br>
Referring to Figure 2 of the drawings, reference numeral 100 generally<br>
indicates another embodiment of a three-phase slurry reactor In accordance with the<br>
16<br><br>
invention. The reactor 100 is similar to the reactor 10 in many respects and the same<br>
reference numerals are thus used to indicate the same or similar parts or features,<br>
unless otherwise indicated In the reactor 100, heat transfer msdium channels 32 are<br>
also defined between some of the plates 14. The heat transfer medium channels 32<br>
have closed lower ends and upper ends, but are in flow communication with each other<br>
at their ends and wtth, heat transfer medium inlet and outlet arrangements (not shown).<br>
In use, heat transfer medium can thus be passed through the s heat transfer medium<br>
channels 32, either upwardly or downwardly.<br>
The slurry channels 16 and the heat transfer medium channels 32 are<br>
arranged alternately, so that each slurry channel 16 is flanked by or sandwiched<br>
between two heat transfer medium channels 32, except possibly for radially outer slurry<br>
channels 16, depending on the particular construction of the reactor 100.<br>
in the reactor 100, the slurry channels 16 and the heat transfer medium<br>
channels 32 are grouped into an upper group, defining an upper plate bank or sub-<br>
reactor 34 and a lower group defining a lower plate bank or sub-reactor 36. The upper<br>
sub-reactor 34 is vertically spaced from the lower sub-reactor 36 so that the open lower<br>
ends of the slurry channels 16 of the upper sub-reactor 34 are above the open upper<br>
ends of the slurry channels 16 of the lower sub-reactor 36. Between the upper sub-<br>
reactor 34 and the lower sub-reactor 36 an intermediate zone 38 is defined. A gas inlet,<br>
which Is a recycle gas inlet and which Is indicated by reference numeral 40 enters the<br>
intermediate zone 3B from two diagonally opposed sides of the reactor 100. Each<br>
recycle gas Wet 40 is associated with a sparger arrangement 42.<br>
A downcomer 44 with a degasser 46 is provided centrally in the reactor shell<br>
12 and extends from above the. open upper ends of the slurry channel 16 of the upper<br>
sub-reactor 34 to below the open lower ends of the slurry channels 16 of the upper sub-<br>
reactor 34, i.e. into the intermediate, zone 38. Between the reactor shell 12 and the<br>
plates 14 of the lower sub-reactor 36, an annular downcomer zone 48 is defined. As<br>
will be noticed, the sparger arrangements 42 are configured not to gas the downcomsr<br>
44 and the sparger arrangement 18 is configured not to gas the downcomer zone 43.<br>
As will be appreciated, the downcomer 44 is in effect staggered relative to th3<br>
17<br><br>
downcomer zone 48, ensuring a slurry recycle or redistribution flow as indicated by the<br>
arrows 50.<br>
The reactor 100 in principle rs suitable for many processes requiring a three-<br>
phase slurry reactor and requiring heat transfer to or from the slurry. However, only one<br>
use, namely hydrocarbon synthesis, will now be described.<br>
In use, fresh synthesis gas comprising mainly carbon monoxide and<br>
hydrogen as gaseous reactants, is fed into the bottom of the reactor 100 through the<br>
gas inist 18 and the sparger arrangement 20. By means of the sparger arrangement<br>
20, the synthesis gas is uniformly distributed throughout the slurry present in the bottom<br>
of the reactor 100. Simultaneously, a recycle gas stream (typically cooled) comprising<br>
typically hydrogen, carbon monoxide, methane and carbon dioxide is returned to the<br>
reactor 100 through the recycle gas Inlets 40 and the sparger arrangements 42. All of<br>
the recycle gas stream may bo fed into the Intermediate zone 38 by means of the<br>
recycle gas inlets 40 or, If desired, a portion of the recycle gas stream may be returned<br>
to the bottom of the reactor 100, by means of the gas inlet 18.<br>
By means, of the sparger arrangements 42, the slurry channels 16 of the<br>
upper sub-reactor 34 are specifically targeted with recycle gas, end the downcomer 44<br>
is avoided. By using the recycle gas inlets 40, it is thus possible to allow a portion of the<br>
recycle gas to bypass the slurry located in the portion of the reactor 100 below the<br>
sparger arrangements 42. in this fashion, the overall gas hold-up in the reactor 100 can<br>
be reduced, thereby surprisingly increasing the reactor capacity.<br>
The gaseous reactants, comprising the fresh synthesis gas and any recycle<br>
gas, pass upwardly through a slurry body 52 which occupies the slurry channels 16 of<br>
the upper and lower sub-reactors 34, 36 and which extends from the bottom of the<br>
reactor 100 to the level 30. The slurry body 52 comprises Fischer-Tropsch catalyst<br>
particles, typically an iron- or cobalt-based catalyst, suspended in liquid product (mostly<br>
wax). The slurry body 52 is controlled to have the slurry level 30 above the open upper<br>
ends of the slurry channels 16 of the upper sub-reactor 34 and above the degasssr 46.<br>
18<br><br>
As the synthesis gas bubbles through the slurry body 52, the gaseous<br>
reactants therein react catalytically and exothermically to form liquid product, which thus<br>
forms part of the slurry body 52. From time to time, or continuously, slurry or liquid<br>
phase including liquid product is withdrawn through the liquid outlet 26, with the slurry<br>
level 30 Thereby being controlled. The catalyst particles are separated from the liquid<br>
product In a suitable internal or external separation system, e.g. using filters (not<br>
shown). If the separation system is located externally to the reactor 100, an additional<br>
system (not shown) to return the separated catalyst particles to the reactor 100 is then<br>
provided.<br>
The fresh synthesis feed gas and the recycle gas are introduced into the<br>
reactor 100 at a rate sufficient to agitate and. suspend all of the catalyst particles inside<br>
the reactor 100 without settling. The gas flow rate will be selected depending on the<br>
slurry concentration, catalyst density, suspending medium density and viscosity, and<br>
particular particle size used. Suitable gas flow rates include, for example, from about 5<br>
cm/s to about 50 enVs. However, gas velocities up to about S5 cm/s have been tested<br>
in bubble columns. The use of higher velocities has the disadvantage that it is<br>
accompanied by a higher gas hold-up in the reactor leaving relatively less space to<br>
accommodate the catalyst-containing slurry. Whatever gas flaw rate is however<br>
selected, It should be sufficient to avoid particle settling and agglomeration in the<br>
reactor 100.<br>
Some slurry continuously passes downwardly through the downcomer 44<br>
and the downcomer zone 48 as indicated by the arrows 50, thereby to achieve<br>
redistribution of catalyst particles within the slurry body 52 and to promote uniform heat<br>
redistribution throughout the slurry body 52. As will be appreciated, depending on the<br>
arrangement of the downcomers or downcomer zones, slurry redistribution over<br>
selected vertically extending regions of the reactor 100 is possible.<br>
The reactor 10a is operated such that the slurry body 52 in the slurry<br>
channels 16 is in a heterogeneous or churn-turbulant flow regime and comprises a<br>
dilute phase consisting of fast-rising larger bubbles of gaseous reactants and gaseous<br>
product which traverse the slurry body 52 virtually in plug flow fashion and a dense<br>
phase which comprises liquid product, solid catalyst particles and entrained smallar<br>
19<br><br>
bubbles of gaseous reactants and gaseous product. By means of the use of the slurry<br>
channels 16, the plug flow behaviour of the entire reactor 100 is promoted, since each<br>
slurry channel 16 has a high aspect ratio when height and width are considered, which<br>
is well in excess of the aspect ratio of the reactor shell 12.<br>
Preferably, the downflow rate of slurry in downcomer zones 44 and 48 is<br>
sufficiently high, that there is substantially no downward flow of slurry in the slurry<br>
channels 16. In this manner, the establishment of a macro-mixing pattern other than<br>
downward in ths downcomer zones 44 and 4S and upwards !n the slurry channels 16 is<br>
largely precluded.<br>
"The slurry body 52 is present in alternate, open-ended, slurry channels 16 in<br>
the upper sub-reactor 34 and the lower sub-reactor 3B. Boiler feed water as cooling<br>
medium is circulated through the clossed-ended heat transfer medium channels 32 to<br>
remove the heat of the exothermic reactions. As will be appreciated, the plates 14<br>
provide large heat transfer surface areas for removing heat 1rom the slurry body 52 by<br>
means of Indirect heat transfer to the boiler feed water.<br>
Light hydrocarbon products, such as a C20 land below fraction are withdrawn<br>
from the reactor 100 through the gas outlet 22 and passed to a separation unit (not<br>
shown). Typically, the separation unit comprises a series of coolers and a vapour-<br>
liquid separator and may optionally include further coolers and separators and possibly<br>
also a cryogenic unit for removal of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, methane and carbon<br>
dioxide from the C20 and below hydrocarbon fraction, other separation technologies<br>
such as membrane units, pressure swing adsorption units and/or units for the selective<br>
removal of carbon dioxide may be employed. The separated gases comprising<br>
nitrogen, carbon monoxide and other gases are compressed and recycled by means of<br>
a compressor tnot shown) to provide the recycle gas stream. Condensed liquid<br>
hydrocarbons and reaction water are withdrawn from tha separation unit for further<br>
working-up.<br>
It is to be appreciated that, although the reactor 100, as illustrated, allows for<br>
the recycle of gas to the reactor 100, it is not necessarily so that a recycle gas stream<br>
will be employed in alt embodiments.<br>
20<br><br>
As a result of the presence of the plates 14, no slurry flow communication is<br>
possible between the slurry channels 18, at all elevations between their open upper<br>
ends and their open tower ends. However, above the open upper ends of the slurry<br>
channels 16 of the upper sub-reactor 34, there is no restriction on the flow of slurry.<br>
Similarly, in the intermediate zone 38 and below the open lower ends of the slurry<br>
channels 16 of. the lower sub-reactor 36 there is no restriction on the How of slurry.<br>
A three-phase slurry reactor in accordance with the invention may Include a<br>
plurality of horizontally disposed reader modules or sub-reactors, which will thus be at<br>
the same elevation inside the reactor shell 12 but disposed across the cross-sectional<br>
area of the reactor shell 12.. In Figures 3 and 4, a few of these horizontally disposed<br>
reactor modules or sub-reactors or plate banks are shown and Indicated by reference<br>
numeral 60. Associated with the sub-reactors 60, are downcomer zones indicated by<br>
reference numeral 62. A sparger arrangement 64 is provided below the sub-reactors 60<br>
and downcomer zones 62.<br>
As will be noted, the downcomer zones 62 also include a plurality of vertically<br>
extending divider walls or plates 14 in the same fashion as the sub-reactors 60.<br>
However, the sparger arrangement 64 does not gas the downcomer zones 62, allowing<br>
the zones 62 to function as downcomers and not as sub-reactors or risers.<br>
Like the sub-reactors 60, the downcomer zones 62 have slurry channels and.<br>
heat transfer medium channels which are alternately arranged.<br>
In Figures 3 and 4, the height of the sub-reactors 60 and the downcomer<br>
zones 62 are shown as being equal. It Is however to be appreciated that they can be<br>
different in height, width and channel breadth.<br>
As indicated by the crossed arrows 61 In Figure 4, there is no slurry<br>
exchange between the sub-reactors 60 or between the sub-reactors 60 and the<br>
downcomer zones 62, except above the open upper ends of the slurry channels and<br>
below the lower open ends of the slurry channels.<br>
21<br><br>
The parallel plates of a sub-reactor or plate bank may define channels 18<br>
with open sides, as shown in Figure 13. or the sub-reactors may havs side walls 63 as<br>
shown in Figure 14. When the sides of the channels 16 are closed by side wails S3, as<br>
shown in Figure 14, there can be no interaction between the slurry in the Channels 16 of<br>
one such sub-reactor with the siuny in the channels 16 of an adjacent sub-reactor,<br>
unless apertures are provided in the side walls 63. Naturally, side walls may enclose<br>
more than one sub-reactor or plate bank.<br>
When two sub-reactors are arranged with their plates 14 parallel, as shown in<br>
Figure 15, and In the absence of side walls, slurry in the channels 16 of one sub-reactor<br>
can interact with ths slurry in the channels 16 of the adjacent sub-reactor. When ths<br>
plates 14 of adjacent sub-reactors are perpendicular, as shown in Figure 16, the end<br>
plate of one sub-reactor in effect defines a side wall, preventing interaction between<br>
slurry in the channels 16 of the two sub-reactors.<br>
Referring to Figure 5 of the drawings, upper sub-reactors 34 and lower sub-<br>
reactors 36 as weli as two downcomers or downcomer zones 62 are shown. Two<br>
sparger arrangements 64, one below the upper sub-reactors 34 and one below the<br>
lower sub-reactors 36, are also shown. In the reactor layout shown in Figure 5, the<br>
downcomers or downcomer zones 62 extend from the upper open ends of the slurry<br>
channels of the upper sub-reactors 34 through the intermediate zone 33 to below the<br>
open lower ends of the lower sub-reactors 36 and in fact to below the lower sparger<br>
arrangement 64. With this arrangement, large scale axial circulation of slurry In a<br>
Known and controlled pattern can be achieved. It Is also possible to allow tor limited<br>
slurry exchange between adjacent sub-reactors 34,a and 34.b or 36.a and 36, b. As will<br>
be appreciated, the slurry channels can be designed to have a desired heat transfer<br>
surface area, hydraulic diameter, etc. If desired, additional gas sparging can be<br>
installed in between vertically spaced sub-reactors, in the intermediate zone 38 and<br>
internal filtration devices can be instated in the Intermediate zone 38 or in one of the<br>
downcomers or downcomer zones 62. One advantage of placing internals such as<br>
filters in a downcomer or downcomer zone Is the reduced gas hold-up and relatively<br>
high velocities encountered in a downcomer rone. By selecting the locations of the<br>
downcomers or downcomer zones 62 and placing them in particular positions on the<br>
cross-sectional area of the reactor sh3ll 12, large scale slurry circulation can be<br>
severely Influenced to achieve desired objects.<br>
22<br><br>
Downcomers or downcomer zones can be helpful in levelling the solids hold-<br>
up profile and temperature profile over the height of a three-phase slurry reactor. At the<br>
same time, however, they indues axial mixing, which sometimes may not be desirable.<br>
By design, the axial mixing can be promoted (resulting in a Kind of rissr-downcomer<br>
mode of operation) or ft can be suppressed in order to promote plug flow characteristics<br>
for the reactor.<br>
Figures 6 to 9 show various embodiments of three-phase slurry reactors in<br>
accordance with the invention, with various downcomer arrangements. In Figure B, the<br>
reactor has four vertically spaced sub-reactors or plate banks, with no downcomer. In<br>
Figure 3, it is shown that a top to bottom downcomer, extending linearly axially through<br>
the sub-reactors or plate banks, can be. employed. Figure 8 illustrates how<br>
downcomers in each sub-reactor or plate bank can be arranged so that the<br>
downcomers, when viewed in plan, are staggered between upper and lower sub-<br>
reactors or plate banks. Figure 9 illustrates a three-phase slurry reactor with divider<br>
walls or plates extending substantially the entire length of the reactor, from a bottom<br>
region to a head space region, with a single downcomer extending from the head space<br>
to the bottom region.<br>
Various arrangements of downcomers or downcomer zones are shown in<br>
Figures 17 to 20 in which the downcomers or downcomsr zones are Indicated by<br>
reference numeral 70, In Figure 17, The downcomer zones 70 are distributed across the<br>
cross-sectional area of the reactor shell 12. In Figure 18, the downcomer zone 70 is<br>
adjacent the reactor shell 12, being roughly annular in plan view. The downcomer zone<br>
70 in Figure 19 is against one side of the reactor shell 12 and in Figure 20, the<br>
downcomer zone 70 Is centrally located,<br>
By means of the arrangement selected for the sub-reactors and downcomer<br>
or downcomer zones, ft fs possible to allow or prevent slurry flow interaction between<br>
different upflow zones in the reactor (defined by the slurry channels), and to prevent or<br>
deny interaction between these upflow zones and downflow zones {defined by the<br>
downcomers or downcomer zones). Thus, in a reactor such as the reactor 100, at a<br>
particular elevation such as the elevation indicated by reference numeral 72 in Figure 2,<br>
23<br><br>
many configurations are possible, some of which are shown in Figurea 21 to 28 of the<br>
drawings.<br>
In Figure 21, the downflow zones 70 are against the sides of the reactor shell<br>
12. Each sub-reactor, indicated by reference numeral 74 has side walls, thereby<br>
preventing slurry interaction between the sub-reactors 74, and between the sub-<br>
reactors 74 and the downflow zones 70.<br>
The sub-reactors 74 in Figure 22 do not have side walls and the slurry<br>
channels of adjacent sub-reactors 74 are parallel. The slurry in these slurry channels<br>
can thus interact In contrast, in Figure 23, the slurry channels of adjacent sub-reactors<br>
74 are arranged perpendicularly. The individual sub-reactors 74 do not have side walls,<br>
although the group of twenty-five sub-reactors has a side wall 76. The sub-reactors 74<br>
are spaced slightly, allowing limited slurry interaction between adjacent sub-reactors 74<br>
but with the perpendicular arrangement of the plates preventing a more free slurry<br>
interaction between adjacent sub-reactors 74. No slurry interaction is allowed between<br>
the upflow zones, i.e. the sub-reactors 74 and the downcorner zones 70,<br>
In Figure 24, the sub-reactors 74 are all provided with side wells and the<br>
downcomer zones 70 are. distributed. There is thus no slurry interaction between the<br>
sub-reactors 74, or between the sub-reactors 74 and the downcomer zones 70. In<br>
contrast, in Figure 25, the sub-reactors 74 do not have side walls and the downcomer<br>
zones 70 are only adjacent the shell 12. Substantial slurry interaction between the sub-<br>
reactors 74, and between the sub-reactors 74 and the downcomer zones 70 can take<br>
place. In Figure 26, the sub-reactors 74 are again without side walls, but many are<br>
arranged with their slurry channels perpendicular to the slurry channels of adjacent sub-<br>
reactors 74. Although there will thus be some interaction between adjacent sub-<br>
reactors 74 and between the sub-reactors 74 and the downcomer zones 70, the slurry<br>
interaction will be more limited than in the case of the reactor shown In Figure 25.<br>
Figure 27 shows a reactor similar to the reactor shown in Figure 26, but In<br>
the case of the reactor of Figure 27, the downcomer zones 70 are disposed across the<br>
cross-sectional area of the reactor.<br>
24<br><br>
in Figure 28, tha downcomer zone 70 Is located against one side of the<br>
reactor shell 12. "There is limited slurry Interaction between the sub-reactors 74 as a<br>
result of the slight spacing between the sub-reactors 74, although they ara arranged at<br>
perpendicular angles, A barrier or side wall 76 substantially prevents slurry interaction<br>
between the slurry in the sub-reactors 74 and the slurry in, the downcomer zone 70.<br>
Various gas sparging strategies are shown in Figures 10 to 12. in Figure 10,<br>
the gas is introduced in two stages, a portion of the gas entering a bottom region of the<br>
reactor and another portion of the gas entering an intermediate zone between two sub-<br>
reactors or plats banks. In Figures 11 and 12, the gas spargers are shown in<br>
combination with downcomers or downcomer zones. As can be dearly seen, it is<br>
possible to gas only a portion of the cross-sectional area of the reactor, in both the<br>
bottom and in the intermediate zones.<br>
The method and apparatus of the present invention therefore allow for much<br>
reduced risk when upscaling slurry flow reactor designs, since the formation of macro-<br>
scals mixing patterns are largely prevented by the presence of slurry channels. In<br>
addition, and especially for designs including downcomers or downcomer zones, the<br>
reaction zone consists of a number of slurry channels in which a known upward<br>
superficial liquid flow rate end a known upward superficial gas velocity exist. These<br>
Slurry channels are amenable to piloting and modelling, giving the designer a greater<br>
degree of control over the large scale reactor mixing patterns. Furthermore, the slurry<br>
channels are formed by heat exchanger surfaces. This leads to much improved heat<br>
removal ability for these designs over standard designs in which serpentine cooling coils<br>
are employed. Not only is the available heat removal surface area increased, but also<br>
more uniformly spread over the reactor.<br>

1.	A method of operating a three-phase slurry reactor, the method including<br>
feeding at a low level through a shell of the reactor at least one gaseous reactant<br>
into a vertically extending slurry body of solid particles suspended in a suspension<br>

spaced slurry channels inside said reactor shell which is a common reactor shell, the<br>
slurry channels being defined between vertically extending horizontally spaced divider<br>
