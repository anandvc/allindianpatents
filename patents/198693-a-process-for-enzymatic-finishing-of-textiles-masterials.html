				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a process for enzymatic finishing of textiles materials.<br>
Poly(ethylene terephthalate) fibers accounts for the main part of the polyester applied by the textile industry. The fibers are produced by e.g. poly-condensation of terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol, and drawing of fibers from a melt. During these processes, at high temperatures, cyclic oligomers, in particular cyclic tri (ethylene terephthalate), are forme-d in and on the fibers.<br>
Cyclic oligomers tend to give fabrics with a content of poly(ethylene terephthalate) fibers a grayish appearance. This is due to deposits of cyclic oligomers on the surface of the fabric, which is particularly outspoken after high temperature wet processes like HT (high temperature) dyeing. The cyclic oligomers are difficult to remove and may even be resistant to an alkaline post treatment [cf. G. Valk et al.; Melliand Textilberichte 1970 5 504-508] . Therefore, to be effective, the alkaline treatment has to be severe, which results in a significant loss of fiber material. Also, organic extraction of the cyclic oligomers is a technical possibility, but not industrially feasible.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an- object of the present invention to provide an enzymatic process *" for removal of cyclic oligomers of poly(ethylene terephthalate), in particular cyclic tri(ethylene<br><br>
terephthalate), by which process the cyclic oligomers are enzymatically hydrolyzed to linear fragments, which can then be removed under gentle conditions, or which may even be leftover. Thus the process of the invention avoids the need for harsh chemicals or organic extraction.<br>
Accordingly,  the  invention  provides  a  process  for      enzymatic  hydrolysis  of  cyclic  oligomers  of  poly(ethylene terephthalate), which process comprises subjecting the cyclic oligomer  to  the  action  of  one  or  more  carboxylic  ester hydrolases.<br>
DETAILED DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a process for enzymatic hydrolysis of cyclic oligomers of poly(ethylene terephthalate). More specifically the invention provides a process for enzymatic hydrolysis of cyclic oligomers of poly(ethylene terephthalate), which process comprises subjecting the cyclic oligomer to the action of one or more carboxylic ester hydrolases, in particular lipolytic and/or biopolyester hydrolytic enzyme(s). In the context of this invention a biopolyester is a polyester of biological origin.<br>
The process of the invention may in particular be applied to yarns or fabrics with a content of poly(ethylene terephthalate) fibers, during which process the content of cyclic oligomers, which were formed as byproducts during synthesis and processing of the fibers, becomes eliminated or at least significantly reduced.<br>
Polyester Fabrics<br>
Poly(ethylene terephthalate) is synthesized by condensation, drawn into fibers from a melt, possibly cut to stables, possibly mixed with other fiber types, and spun to yarn. The yarn is dyed and knitted into cloth or made into carpets, or the yarn is woven into fabric and dyed. These processes can be followed by finishing (post treatment) steps.<br><br>
During synthesis and drawing, cyclic oligomers of poly(ethylene terephthalate) are formed on and in the fibers. These cyclic oligomers are partly deposited on machinery, partly staying on/in the fibers, which turns out to give an undesirable grayish appearance of the final fabric or carpet.<br>
Cyclic oligomers can be removed by organic extraction, but such a process is not industrially feasible due to cost and problems in handling and regeneration of large quantities of organic solvents. Cyclic oligomers can also be removed by an alkaline post scouring step, but to be effective the alkaline treatment has to be severe and results in significant loss of fiber material, too.<br>
According to the present invention, removal of cyclic oligomers, in particular cyclic triraers, can be accomplished by hydrolysis with one or more hydrolytic enzymes. The enzyme breaks the ring structure of the cyclic oligomer by hydrolyzing an ester bond. The resulting product creates less of a problem, because it can be removed under gentle conditions or even leftover in the product.<br>
The enzymatic treatment does not have the disadvantages valid for organic extraction and alkaline post scouring, in particular is does not require large quantities of organic solvent to be involved, and there is no significant loss of fiber material.<br>
The process of the invention is readily applicable in the textile industry as it can be carried out using existing wet processing apparatus, such as in a beam dyer, a Pad-Roll, a Jigger/Winch, a J-Box, or Pad-Steam types of apparatus. The process preferably takes place during the finishing (post "  treatment) step.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the process of the invention may be accomplished on cyclic oligomers of poly(ethylene terephthalate) present on and/or in fibers or in yarn or fabric made (or partially made) from poly(ethylene terephthalate) i fibers. Thus, the polyester yarn or fabric may be any yarn or fabric that is made from pure poly(ethylene terephthalate), or that is made from blends of poly(ethylene terephthalate) fibers<br><br>
and any other material conventionally used for making yarns or fabrics.<br>
Thus, in a preferred embodiment, the invention provides a process for enzymatic treatment of polyester fibers, which process comprises subjecting the polyester fiber or fabric to the action of one or more carboxylic ester hydrolases, in particular lipolytic and/or biopolyester hydrolytic enzyme(s).<br>
The polyester fabric may be any fabric or fabric blend comprising polyester. Preferably the fabric comprises more than 50% (w/w) of polyester, in particular more than 75% (w/w) of polyester, more than 90% (w/w) of polyester, or more than 95% (w/w) of polyester. In a most preferred embodiment, the process of the invention is applied to fabrics or textiles or yarns consisting essentially of poly(ethylene terephthalate) polyester material, i.e. pure poly(ethylene terephthalate) polyester material.<br>

EXAMPLE 1<br>
In this example eleven different enzymes with lipolytic and/or biopolyester hydrolytic activity are examined for their activity towards cyclic oligomers of poly(ethylene terephthalate). The cyclic oligomers are obtained from polyester fabric by Soxhlet extraction with 1,4-dioxane.<br>
The eleven enzymes tested in this example are:<br>
Bacillus   pumilus    lipase  (obtained as described in WO<br>
91/16422) ;<br>
Bacillus  stearothermophilus  lipase (obtained as described<br>
in JP 64/744992);<br>

lipase (obtained as described in EP 305,216); Recombinantly produced guinea pig lipase (rGPL) (obtained as described in WO 93/00426);<br>
Humicola  insolens  cutinase (actually a lipase also having cutinase activity,  obtained from the strain Humicola<br><br>
insolens    DSM 1800  as described in Example 2 of US<br>
4,810,414) ;<br>
Aspergillus     aculeatus     pectin  methyl  esterase  (PME;<br>
obtained as described in WO 94/25575); and<br>
Aspergillus   aculeatus   acetyl esterase (AE; obtained as<br>
described in WO 95/02689) .<br>
The substrate solution is incubated with the hydrolytic enzyme preparation in an agar gel containing phenol-red. 1000 ml agar gel is prepared from 17 g Agarose type 2 medium EEO (Sigma, A-6877) , 3 g NaNOj, 1 g K^HPO^, 0.5 g KCl, 1 ml 1% (w/v) FeSO^, and 50 ml 0.4 g/1 phenol-red solution, pH adjusted to 8.0-8.5.<br><br><br><br>
The substrate solution, 15 jxl tributyrine or cyclic oligomers, is poured into plug holes in the agar, and the • aqueous enzyme solution is mixed into the substrate solution. If the enzyme is capable of hydrolyzing the substrate, then acids are formed and diffuse into the gel, where the pH indicator phenol-red turns from red to yellow.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
In this example a lipolytic and biopolyester hydrolytic enzyme [Humicola insolens cutinase derived from the strain Humicola insolens DSM 1800 as described in WO 96/13580) is examined for activity towards cyclic tri(ethylene terephthalate). The cyclic trimer is obtained from polyester fabric by Soxhlet extraction with 1,4-dioxane, and is further purified by ethanol and 1,4-dioxane washes.<br>
A mixture of the following composition is incubated at 3 0°C for 16 hours:<br>
0.25 ml glycylglycine buffer, 0.2 M pH 8.5<br>
2.50 ml de-ionized water<br>
0.25 ml cyclic trimer, 5.0 mM in 1,4-dioxane<br>
62.5 fig of enzyme<br>
The reaction is stopped by adding 5.0 ml 1,4-dioxane, and the mixture is analyzed on a reverse phase HPLC, ODS (octa dodecyl silicate) column eluted with acetonitrile and pH 3.0 phosphate-buffer. Detection of the reaction products is carried out spectrophotometrically at 24 0 nm, at which wavelength the terephthalic acid and terephthalate derivatives adsorb.<br><br><br>
In this example 56% of the cyclic tri (ethylene terephthalate) is degraded under the given conditions by the cutinase  from Humicola     insolens,      yielding  four  detectable<br>
degradation products.<br>
Following this experiment three of these products have been  identified  as  ethylene  bis(terephthalic  acid)  ester (iyiW=342) , terephthalic acid mono {2-hydroxyethyl) ester (MW=210) and terephthalic acid (]yiW=166) .<br><br><br>
