				<td>METHOD FOR THE PRODUCTION OF A SELF-LUBRICATING POLYMER<br>
MATERIAL FOR SEALING ELEMENTS<br>
The pre,sent invention relates to a method for the<br>
production of a self-lubricating polymer material for<br>
sealing elements.<br>
In particular, the present invention relates to a method<br>
for producing a polymer material with lubricating<br>
microcapsules incorporated into the polymer matrix, which<br>
material is suitable for producing sealing elements in<br>
reciprocating compressors.<br>
As is known, reciprocating compressors are equipped with<br>
a piston which is moved axially within a cylinder in<br>
order to compress a gas. Generally, the piston of<br>
reciprocating compressors is equipped with annular<br>
sealing elements arranged coaxially relative to the axis<br>
of the piston and the cylinder and accommodated in a seat<br>
formed in the side wall of the piston itself.<br>
These piston sealing rings are subject to wear as they<br>
slide along the cylindrical cavity.<br>
With the aim of restricting the wear rate thereof,<br>
specific non-metallic materials are used which exhibit<br>
sealing properties, ease of handling, a low modulus of<br>
elasticity and a coefficient of dynamic friction.<br>
Non-metallic materials which are particularly suitable as<br>
constituents of sealing elements are polyetherether<br>
ketone (PEEK), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and<br>
polybutadiene-styrene (PBS).<br>
It has, however, been found that sealing elements made<br>
from these resins have a tendency to undergo permanent<br>
deformation if subjected to stress for extended periods.<br>
In particular, under operating conditions of elevated<br>
pressure and temperature, sealing elements of<br>
conventional resin not only degrade prematurely, but are<br>
also subject to permanent deformation along the dividing<br>
line to an extent such as to impair the compression seal.<br>
In order to prevent these disadvantages from occurring, a<br>
novel plastics material based on a self-lubricating<br>
polymer matrix in which are dispersed microcapsules<br>
filled with a lubricating fluid has been developed and is<br>
the subject of a copending patent application in the name<br>
of Nuovo Pignone.<br>
The polymer matrix of this plastics material is made from<br>
a polymer material which is resistant to wear and<br>
elevated temperatures, typically a linear aromatic<br>
polyketone such as PEEK," which optionally contains<br>
fillers or fibres: to increase its mechanical strength or<br>
.thermal conductivity.<br>
The polymer materials on which this novel plastics<br>
material are based exhibit elevated softening points and<br>
the behaviour thereof is thus little influenced by<br>
temperature conditions. The microcapsules incorporated<br>
into said base polymers are conventionally produced by<br>
means of in situ polymerisation processes, which<br>
typically use a shell of polyoxymethylene urea (PMU) , or<br>
by means of prilling processes. The raicrocapsule shells<br>
are generally made from a material having a relatively<br>
low softening temperature. The fluid lubricant<br>
incorporated in the microcapsules generally has a low<br>
heat capacity.<br>
In order to prevent the lubricating fluid or capsules<br>
from burning, low processing temperatures or rapid<br>
heating and cooling cycles are used.<br>
However, conventional methods for the production of these<br>
polymer materials are not without disadvantages, which<br>
primarily occur when low processing temperatures are<br>
used.<br>
Occurrence of these disadvantages is primarily<br>
attributable to reduced fusion of the pellets during<br>
compression moulding operations.<br>
Moreover, it has been found that if, during the<br>
production process for these polymer materials,<br>
temperatures are raised in order to produce fused or<br>
tacky pellets, the polymer deforms or burns.<br>
When conventional production methods are used to produce<br>
this novel material, the polymer matrix and microcapsules<br>
containing the lubricating fluid segregate during or at<br>
the end of the injection moulding phase.<br>
In particular, it has been found when producing said<br>
novel plastics material that, during the injection<br>
moulding phase, the problem of segregation of the two<br>
components (the polymer and the microcapsules containing<br>
lubricating fluid) is primarily attributable to the<br>
wettability and contamination of the microcapsule shell.<br>
Consequently, use of the novel self-lubricating polymer<br>
materials containing microcapsules may currently be<br>
restricted by the problems encountered during the<br>
production ;thereof using currently available methods.<br>
One of the general objects of the present invention is to<br>
overcome or to limit substantially the occurrence of the<br>
disadvantages of the prior art which are encountered in<br>
the production of polymer materials incorporating<br>
lubricating microcapsules.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
method for producing a polymer material containing<br>
lubricating microcapsules which is simple to perform and<br>
entails low production costs.<br>
A further object of the invention is to provide a method<br>
for producing polymer materials for sealing elements<br>
provided with lubricating microcapsules in which the<br>
risks of segregation of the polymer phase and the<br>
microcapsules are minimised.<br>
It has now surprisingly been found that it is possible to<br>
produce a plastics material provided with a polymer<br>
matrix with incorporated lubricating microcapsules by<br>
pulverising a polymer material by means of cooling to<br>
cryogenic temperatures and mixing the pulverised polymer<br>
with microcapsules containing a lubricating fluid. When<br>
the mixture of pulverised polymer and microcapsules is<br>
moulded,., a self-lubricating polymer material is obtained<br>
which is usable as a base component for sealing elements,<br>
such as the compression rings for reciprocating<br>
compressor pistons.<br>
In the light of the above-stated and other objects which<br>
will emerge more clearly below, a first aspect of the<br>
present invention accordingly provides a method for the<br>
production of a self-lubricating polymer material<br>
comprising the stages:<br>
cooling a polymer material to cryogenic<br>
temperatures, preferably using liquid nitrogen, to<br>
yield a crumbly, frozen polymer material,<br>
crushing said crumbly polymer material to yield an<br>
ultrafine polymer powder,<br>
adding microcapsules containing a lubricating fluid<br>
to said ultrafine powder to produce a polymer<br>
mixture in which the lubricating microcapsules are<br>
dispersed,<br>
moulding said polymer mixture, advantageously by<br>
means of compression or injection moulding.<br>
Polymer materials usable for the purposes of the present<br>
invention- include polyketones and in particular aromatic<br>
polyketones, among which polyetherether ketone (PEEK) is<br>
preferred.<br>
For the purposes of- the present invention, the phrase<br>
"lubricating microparticles containing a lubricating<br>
fluid" is intended to mean encapsulated lubricating<br>
particles and multiparticles, homogeneous fluids or<br>
encapsulated lubricating multilayer materials and in<br>
general lubricating agents incorporated in microcapsules.<br>
Lubricating agents usable in the method of the invention<br>
are lubricating oils, such as for example organic,<br>
natural or synthetic oils.<br>
Particularly suitable oils are lubricating oils which are<br>
low in acidity and resistant to elevated temperatures.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the lubricating oil<br>
incorporated into said microcapsules exhibits viscosity<br>
values within the range between 20 and 250 cSt, measured<br>
at a temperature of approx. 40°C.<br>
The microcapsules used for the purposes of the present<br>
invention may be spherical, symmetrical or irregularly<br>
shaped.<br>
According to one embodiment, said microcapsules have an<br>
average diameter" within the range between 5 and 500<br>
microns, preferably between 20 and 260 microns.<br>
Advantageously, "said microcapsules comprise a shell of<br>
wax or of a polymer material, preferably polyoxymethylene<br>
urea, which is abbreviated as PMU.<br>
The microcapsules may also contain additives to enhance<br>
lubricating action.<br>
In particular, it is also possible to include additives<br>
to improve sliding between friction surfaces, such as for<br>
example microelements such as zinc, boron and mixtures<br>
thereof.<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention, the<br>
pulverised polymer is mixed with a quantity of<br>
lubricating microcapsules of between 1 and 30 wt.%.<br>
The lubricating fluid may be incorporated into said<br>
microcapsules using various microencapsulation<br>
technologies, such as dry spraying, prilling,<br>
coacervation, in situ polymerisation and with soft<br>
alginate beads.<br>
The various encapsulation methods for the lubricating<br>
fluid are used depending upon the required dimensions of<br>
the lubricating particles and upon the ultimate use of<br>
the self-lubricating material.<br>
Using the dry spraying process, for example, it is<br>
possible to encapsulate the lubricant fluids in capsules<br>
of dimensions as small as 5-30 microns.<br>
In the prilling process, which is usually used to produce<br>
capsules of dimensions between 1 and 100 microns, the<br>
lubricant fluid to be encapsulated is first of all<br>
introduced into a molten wax or other polymer matrix,<br>
then sprayed into droplets which subsequently solidify on<br>
cooling. The microcapsules produced in this manner act as<br>
a shell for the lubricant contents. Microcapsules<br>
produced by prilling release the lubricant under pressure<br>
or, if desired, by selecting polymers with an appropriate<br>
melting point, after exposure to a predetermined<br>
temperature.<br>
Using coacervation, the lubricating fluid may also be<br>
enclosed in microcapsules of a diameter within the range<br>
between 25 and approx. 300 microns.<br>
In simple coacervation, the walls of the capsules are<br>
typically made from gelatine, polyvinyl alcohol,<br>
methylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone and other polymers.<br>
In complex coacervation, the capsule walls are produced<br>
using systems based on gelatine-acacia copolymers.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment/ the microcapsules<br>
are produced by in situ polymerisation which makes it<br>
possible to produce a strong polymer shell, preferably of<br>
urea-formaldehyde copolymer (PMU), around the drop of<br>
lubricating' liquid. Encapsulation in a PMU shell is<br>
typically an emulsion process, in which an emulsion of<br>
the material to be encapsulated is prepared in an aqueous<br>
solution.<br>
By way of example, it is also possible to use<br>
microcapsules containing lubricant produced using the<br>
method described in US patent 5,112,541 for the purposes<br>
of performing the method of the present invention.<br>
According to another embodiment of the invention, it is<br>
possible to use surface treatments to improve wettability<br>
close to the surface of the microcapsules with the aim of<br>
minimising segregation phenomena which may occur during<br>
the injection moulding phase.<br>
According to another aspect, the present invention<br>
provides a method for producing an intermediate of the<br>
above-described process, said method comprising the<br>
stages:<br>
providing a base polymer material,<br>
cooling a said base polymer material to cryogenic<br>
temperatures, preferably using liquid nitrogen, to<br>
yield a crumbly polymer material,<br>
pulverising said crumbly polymer material to obtain<br>
an ultrafine polymer powder.<br>
The resultant ultrafine polymer powder is an intermediate<br>
product which may be used to produce self-lubricating<br>
polymer materials by means of moulding.<br>
The features and advantages of the method of the present<br>
invention will emerge more clearly from the following<br>
description, which is provided by way of non-limiting<br>
example, with reference to the attached diagram, in<br>
which:<br>
Figure 1 shows four bar charts (1-4) which summarise the<br>
results of comparative testing of wear stated in terms of<br>
a wear coefficient as factor K (in3min/ft/lb/hr) x109;<br>
(shaded column 2 and dotted column 4) and of coefficient<br>
of friction, stated in p (clear columns 1 and 3).<br>
Columns 1-4 show the comparative behaviour data arising<br>
from sliding of:<br>
1) a polymer designated Ultem 1000 (columns 1 and 2), a<br>
standard product of General Electric and<br>
2) a polymer material based on Ultem 1000 with<br>
microcapsules incorporated at a rate of 10 wt.%<br>
(columns 3 and 4), produced according to one<br>
embodiment of the method of the invention (clear<br>
columns);<br>
against tempered steel.<br>
The microcapsules incorporated into the Ultem 1000 resin<br>
contain a low viscosity oil according to one embodiment<br>
of the invention.<br>
The wear tests whose results are summarised in the bar<br>
charts were performed under conditions which provide a<br>
sliding speed of 300 ft/min (1.524 m/s), a pressure load<br>
of 200 psi (13.8 bar) and a test duration of 20 hours<br>
"run-in" and 80 hours "steady state".<br>
On the basis of the results from the tests performed, it<br>
is clear that the wear rate against steel of the plastic<br>
Ultem 1000 incorporating microcapsules produced according<br>
to an embodiment of the method of the invention, is<br>
reduced by a good three orders of magnitude, while<br>
friction" is reduced by one order of magnitude, relative<br>
to the prior art resin Ultera 1000.<br>
The following Example is provided merely by way of<br>
illustration of the present invention and should<br>
accordingly not be taken to restrict the scope of<br>
protection, which is defined by the attached claims.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
A PEEK polymer material was dried in a vacuum kiln at a<br>
temperature within the range between 65 and 70°C for a<br>
period of approx. 8 hours.<br>
Microcapsules containing a lubricating oil, which had<br>
previously been produced by means of in situ<br>
polymerisation, were added to the polymer powder in a<br>
ratio of 10 wt.%.<br>
The mixture of polymer powder and microcapsules was then<br>
compression moulded using a closed mould in order to<br>
permit uniform heating and pressurisation of the polymer<br>
material. The moulded and cooled material was pressurised<br>
to values of between 1.5 and 2.5 t to expel air from the<br>
mould.<br>
The mould used was placed in a preheated press. The<br>
temperature of the press depended upon the melting point<br>
of the thermoplastic polymer with reduced load (e.g. 100<br>
kg) .<br>
The mould reached approx. 80-90% of the predetermined<br>
press temperature before the load was applied.<br>
The load was applied to values of between 250 and 1500 kg<br>
with time and load increments for a total period of<br>
approx. 10-15 minutes. The final load was maintained<br>
while the mould was allowed to cool to ambient<br>
temperature.<br>
