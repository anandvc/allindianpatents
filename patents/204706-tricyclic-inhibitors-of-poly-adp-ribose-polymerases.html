COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10]<br>
"TRICYCLIC INHIBITORS OF POLY[ADP-RIBOSE] POLYMERASES"<br>
AGOURON PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.,.a California corporation of 10350 North Torrey Pines Road, La NJolla,,. California 92037, United States of America and CANCER RESEARCH CAMPAIGN TECHNOLOGY LIMITED, of 5 Alfred Place, London WC1E 7EB, United Kingdom,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional  Application No. 60/152,142, filed August 31, 1999.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention pertains to compounds that inhibit poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases, thereby retarding the repair of damaged DNA strands, and to methods of preparing such compounds. The invention also relates to the use of such compounds in pharmaceutical compositions and therapeutic treatments useful for potentiation of anti¬cancer therapies, inhibition of neurotoxicity consequent to stroke, head trauma, and neurodegenerative diseases, and prevention of insulin-dependent diabetes.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs), nuclear enzymes found in almost all eukaryotic cells, catalyze the transfer of ADP-ribpse units from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) to nuclear acceptor proteins, and are responsible for the formation of protein-bound linear and branched homo-ADP-ribose polymers. Activation of PARP and resultant formation of poly(ADP-ribose) are induced by DNA strand breaks, e.g., after exposure to chemotherapy, ionizing radiation, oxygen free radicals, or nitric oxide (NO). The acceptor proteins of poly(ADP-ribose), including histones, topoisomerases, DNA and RNA polymerases, DNA ligases, and Ca2+- and Mg2+-dependent endonucleases, are involved in maintaining DNA integrity.<br>
Because this cellular ADP-ribose transfer process is associated with the repair of DNA strand breakage in response to DNA damage caused by radiotherapy or chemotherapy, it can contribute to the resistance that often develops to various types of cancer therapies. Consequently, inhibition of PARP may retard intracellular DNA repair and enhance the antitumor effects of cancer therapy. Indeed, in vitro and in vivo data show that many PARP inhibitors potentiate the effects of ionizing radiation or<br><br>
cytotoxic drugs such as DNA methylating agents.    Thus, inhibitors of the PARP enzyme are useful as adjunct cancer chemotherapeutics.<br>
PARP inhibitors are additionally useful in therapy of cardiovascular diseases. Ischemia, a deficiency of oxygen and glucose in a part of the body, can be caused by an obstruction in the blood vessel supplying that area or a massive hemorrhage. Two severe forms, heart attack and stroke, are major killers in the developed world. CeD death results directly and also occurs when the deprived area is reperfused. PARP inhibitors are being developed to treat ischemia/reperfusion injuries. See, e.g., Zhang, "PARP inhibition: a novel approach to treat ischemia/reperfusion and inflammation-related injuries," Emerging Drugs: The Prospect for Improved Medicines (1999), Ashley Publications Ltd. Inhibition, of PARP has been shown to protect against myocardial ischemia and reperfusion injury (Zingarelli et al., "Protection against myocardial ischemia and reperfusion injury by 3-aminobenzamide, an inhibitor of poly (ADP-ribose) synthetase," Cardiovascular Research (1997), 36:205-215).<br>
Inhibitors of the PARP enzyme are also useful inhibitors of neurotoxicity consequent to stroke, head trauma, and neurodegenerative diseases. After brain ischemia, the distribution of cells with accumulation of poly(ADP-ribose), that is, the areas where PARP was activated, correspond to the regions of ischemic damage (Love et al., "Neuronal accumulation of poly(ADP-ribose) after brain ischaemia," Neuropathology and Applied Neurobiology (1999), 25:98-103). It has been shown that inhibition of PARP promotes resistance to brain injury after stroke (Endres et al., "Ischemic Brain Injury is Mediated by the Activation of Poly(ADP-Ribose)Polymerase," J. Cerebral Blood Flow Metab. (1997), 17:1143-1151; Zhang, "PARP Inhibition Results in Substantial Neuroprotection in Cerebral Ischemia," Cambridge Healthtech Institute's Conference on Acute Neuronal Injury: New Therapeutic Opportunities, Sept. 18-24, 1998, Las Vegas, Nevada).<br>
The activation of PARP by DNA damage is believed to play a role in the cell death consequent to head trauma and neurodegenerative diseases, as well as stroke. DNA is damaged by excessive amounts of NO produced when the NO synthase enzyme is activated as a result of a series of events initiated by the release of the neurotransmitter glutamate from depolarized nerve terminals (Cosi et al., "Poly(ADP-<br><br>
Ribose) Polymerase Revisited: A New Role for an Old Enzyme: PARP Involvement in Neurodegeneration and PARP Inhibitors as Possible Neuroprotective Agents," Ann. N.Y. Acad. ScL (1997), 825:366-379). Cell death is believed to occur as a result of energy depletion as NAD+ is consumed by the enzyme-catalyzed PARP reaction.<br>
Parkinson's disease is an example of a neurodegenerative condition whose progression may be prevented by PARP inhibition. Mandir et al. have demonstrated that mice that lack the gene for PARP are "dramatically spared" from the effects of exposure to l-methyl-4-phenyl-l,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), a neurotoxin that causes parkinsonism in humans and animals (Mandir et al., "Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase activation mediates l-methyl-4-phenyl-l,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced parkinsonism," Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA (1999), 96:5774-5779). MPTP potently activates PARP exclusively in dopamine-containing neurons of the substantia nigra, the part of the brain whose degeneration is associated with development of parkinsonism. Hence, potent PARP inhibitors may slow the onset and development of this crippling condition.<br>
Furthermore, inhibition of PARP should be a useful approach for treatment of conditions or diseases associated with cellular senescence, such as skin aging, through the role of PARP in the signaling of DNA damage. See, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,589,483.<br>
PARP inhibition is also being studied at the clinical level to prevent development of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in susceptible individuals (Saldeen et al., "Nicotinamide-induced apoptosis in insulin producing cells in associated with cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase," Mol. Cellular Endocrinol. (1998), 139:99-107). In models of Type I diabetes induced by toxins such as streptozocin and alloxan that destroy pancreatic islet cells, it has been shown that knock-out mice lacking PARP are resistant to cell destruction and diabetes development (Pieper et al., "Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, nitric oxide, and cell death," Trends Pharmacolog. Sci. (1999), 20:171-181; Burkart et al., "Mice lacking the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase gene are ^resistant to pancreatic beta-cell destruction and diabetes development induced by streptozocin," Nature Medicine (1999), 5:314-319). Administration of nicotinamide, a weak PARP inhibitor and a free-radical scavenger, prevents development of diabetes in<br><br>
a spontaneous autoimmune diabetes model, the non-obese, diabetic mouse (Pieper et al., ibid). Hence, potent and specific PARP inhibitors may be useful as diabetes-prevention therapeutics.<br>
PARP inhibition is also an approach for treating inflammatory conditions such as arthritis (Szabo et al., "Protective effect of an inhibitor of poly(ADP-ribose) synthetase in collagen-induced arthritis," Portland Press Proc. (1998), 15:280-281; Szabo, "Role of Poly(ADP-ribose) Synthetase in Inflammation," Eur. J. Biochem. (1998), 350(1): 1-19; Szabo et al., "Protection Against Peroxynitrite-induced Fibroblast Injury and Arthritis Development by Inhibition of Pdly(ADP-ribose) Synthetase," Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA (1998), 95(7):3867-72).<br>
The PARP family of enzymes is extensive. It has recently been shown that tankyrases, which bind to the telomeric protein TRF-1, a negative regulator of telomere length maintenance, have a catalytic domain that is strikingly homologous to PARP and have been shown to have PARP activity in vitro. It has been proposed that telomere function in human cells is regulated by poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation. PARP inhibitors have utility as tools to study this function. Further, as a consequence of regulation of telomerase activity by tankyrase, PARP inhibitors should have utility as agents for regulation of cell life-span, e.g., for use in cancer therapy to shorten the life¬span of tumor cells, or as anti-aging therapeutics, since telomere length is believed to be associated with cell senescence.<br>
Various competitive inhibitors of PARP have been described. For example, Banasik et al. ("Specific Inhibitors of PoIy(ADP-Ribose) Synthetase and Mono(ADP-Ribosyl)transferase," J. Biol. Chem. (1992) 267:1569-1575) examined the PARP-inhibiting activity of over one hundred compounds, the most potent of which were 4-amino-l,8-naphthalimide, 6(5H)-phenanthridone, 2-nitro-6(5H)-phenanthridone, and 1,5-dihydroxyisoquinoIine. Griffin et al. reported the PARP-inhibiting activity for certain benzamide compounds (U.S. Patent No. 5,756,510; see also "Novel Potent Inhibitors of the DNA Repair Enzyme Poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP)," Anti-Cancer Drug Design (1995), 10:507-514), benzimidazole compounds (International Publication No. WO 97/04771), and quinalozinone compounds (International Publication No. WO 98/33802).    Suto et al. reported PARP inhibition by certain<br><br>
dihydroisoqumoline compounds ("Dihydroisoquinolines: The Design and Synthesis of a New Series of Potent Inhibitors of Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase," Anti-Cancer Drug Design (1991), 7:107-117). Griffin et al. have reported other PARP inhibitors of the quinazoline class ("Resistance-Modifying Agents. 5. Synthesis and Biological Properties of Quinazoline Inhibitors of the DNA Repair Enzyme Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase (PARP)," J. Med. Chem. (1998) 41:5247-5256). International Publication Nos. WO 99/11622, WO 99/11623, WO 99/11624, WO 99/11628, WO 99/11644, WO 99/11645, and WO 99/11649 describe various PARP-inhibiting compounds. Furthermore, certain tricyclic PARP inhibitors are described in commonly owned U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/115,431, filed January 11, 1999, in the name of Webber et al., the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein.<br>
Nonetheless, there is still a need for small-molecule compounds that are active PARP inhibitors, especially those that have physical, chemical, and pharmacokinetic properties desirable for therapeutic applications.<br>

For example, PARP activity may be inhibited in mammalian tissue by administering such an agent.<br>
"Treating" or "treatment" is intended to mean mitigating or alleviating an injury or a disease condition in a mammal, such as a human, that is mediated by the inhibition of PARP activity, such as by potentiation of anti-cancer therapies or inhibition of neurotoxicity consequent to stroke, head trauma, and neurodegenerative diseases.

The invention also provides therapeutic interventions appropriate in disease or injury states where PARP activity is deleterious to a patient. For example, the tricyclic compounds of the invention are useful for treating cancer, inflammation, the effects of heart attack, stroke, head trauma and neurodegenerative disease, and diabetes.<br>
One treatment method involves improving the effectiveness of a cytotoxic drug and/or radiotherapy administered to a mammal in the course of therapeutic treatment, comprising administering to the mammal, an effective amount of a PARP-inhibiting agent (compound, pharmaceutically acceptable salt, prodrug, active metabolite, or solvate) in conjunction with administration of the cytotoxic drug (e.g., topotecan, irinotecan, temozolimide) and/or radiotherapy. The agents of the invention preferably have a cytotoxicity potentiation activity corresponding to a PF50 of greater than 1 in the cytotoxicity potentiation assay.<br>
The PARP-inhibiting agents may also be advantageously used in a method for reducing neurotoxicity consequent to stroke, head trauma, and neurodegenerative diseases in a mammal by administering a therapeutically effective amount of an inventive agent to the mammal.<br>

Moreover, the agents may also be used in a method for treating cardiovascular disease in a mammal, comprising administering to the mammal a therapeutically effective amount of a PARP-inhibiting agent. More particularly, a therapeutic intervention method provided by the present invention is a cardiovascular therapeutic method for protecting against myocardial  ischemia and reperfusion  injury in a<br><br>
mammal, comprising administering to the mammal an effective amount of a compound<br>
of formula I, n, or HI or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, prodrug, active metabolite,<br>
or solvate thereof.<br>
The activity of the inventive agents as inhibitors of PARPactivity may be<br>
"X	<br>
measured by any of the suitable methods known or available in the art, including by in<br>
vivo and in vitro assays. An example of a suitable assay for activity measurements is<br>
the PARP enzyme inhibition assay described herein.<br>
Administration of the compounds of the formula I, n, or HI, and their pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs, salts, active metabolites, and solvates may be performed according to any of the generally accepted modes of. administration available in the art. Illustrative examples of suitable modes of administration include intravenous, oral, nasal, parenteral, topical, transdermal, and rectal delivery. Oral and intravenous delivery are preferred.<br>
An inventive agent may be administered as a pharmaceutical composition in any pharmaceutical form recognizable to the skilled artisan as being suitable. Suitable" pharmaceutical forms include solid, semisolid, liquid, or lyophilized formulations, such as tablets, powders, capsules, suppositories, suspensions, liposomes, and aerosols. Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may also include suitable excipients, diluents, vehicles, and carriers, as well as other pharmaceutically active agents [including other PARP-inhibiting agents), depending upon the intended use.<br>
Acceptable methods of preparing suitable pharmaceutical forms of the compositions are generally known or may be routinely determined by those skilled in the art. For example, pharmaceutical preparations may be prepared following conventional techniques of the pharmaceutical chemist involving steps such as mixing, granulating, and compressing when necessary for tablet forms, or mixing, filling, and dissolving the ingredients as appropriate to give the desired products for intravenous, oral, parenteral, topical, intravaginal, intranasal, intrabronchial, intraocular, intraaural, and/or rectal administration.<br>
Solid or liquid pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents, vehicles, or<br>
/ excipients may be employed in the pharmaceutical compositions.   Illustrative solid<br>
carriers include starch, lactose, calcium sulphate dihydrate, terra alba, sucrose, talc,<br><br>

The carrier or diluent may include a suitable prolonged-release material, such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate, alone or with a wax. When a liquid carrier is used, the preparation may be in the form of a syrup, elixir, emulsion, soft gelatin capsule, sterile injectable liquid (e.g., solution), or a nonaqueous or aqueous liquid suspension.<br>
A dose of the pharmaceutical composition contains at least a therapeutically effective amount of a PARP-inhibiting agent (i.e., a compound of formula I, n, or EI, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, prodrug, active metabolite, or solvate thereof), and preferably contains one or more pharmaceutical dosage units. The selected dose may be administered to a mammal, for example, a human patient, in need of treatment of a condition mediated by inhibition of PARP activity, by any known or suitable method of administering the dose, including: topically, for example, as an ointment or cream; orally; rectally, for example, as a suppository; parenterally by injection; or continuously by intravaginal, intranasal, intrabronchial, intraaural, or intraocular infusion. A "therapeutically effective amount" is intended to mean the amount of an agent that, when administered to a mammal in need thereof, is sufficient to effect treatment for injury or disease condition mediated by inhibition of PARP activity. The amount of a given agent of the invention that will be therapeutically effective will vary depending upon factors such as the particular agent, the disease condition and the severity thereof, the identity of the mammal in need thereof, which amount may be routinely determined by artisans.<br>
It will be appreciated that the actual dosages of the PARP-inhibiting agents used in the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention will be selected according to the properties of the particular agent being used, the particular composition formulated, the mode of administration and the particular site, and the host and condition being treated. Optimal dosages for a given set of conditions can be ascertained by those skilled in the art using conventional dosage-determination tests. For oral / administration, e.g., a dose that may be employed is from about 0.001 to about 1000 mg/kg body weight, with courses of treatment repeated at appropriate intervals.<br><br>
Synthetic Processes:<br>
The PARP-inhibiting agents of the invention may be synthesized according to the processes described below, such as the one of the following general processes.<br>
General Process A<br><br>
II<br>
In this process, an ortho-substituted-aniline (la) is alkylated to an N-substituted intermediate (Ha), which can be further converted to cyclic ketone (Ilia). The ketone (THa) can be transformed to a compound of formula I via alternative routes. When Q is a nitro group, it can be reduced to the corresponding amine and further used in a reaction with an acid chloride to provide tricyclic ketone intermediate (TVa). Ring expansion of (TVa) yields a tricyclic amide with formula I (Y = N, X = O), which may be further derivatized. A more preferred and alternative route for the conversion of a<br><br>
ketone (Ilia) to I (Y = N) or II (Z = O, S) involves first performing the ring expansion step to yield intermediate amide (Va), followed by reduction of the nitro group and cyclization with an acid chloride, aldehyde, or any reagent used to form a urea or thiourea. The product formed may also be further derivatized. For intermediate (Ilia) when Q is an appropriate leaving group, however, it can be transformed to an acetylene derivative (Va) where Q is GC-Ri, which is further converted to I (Y = CH). The product formed may also be further derivatized. General Process B<br><br>
Under this reaction scheme, an indoline (lb) is alkylated to the N-substituted intermediate (lib), which is further converted to tricyclic ketone (mb). The tricyclic ketone (nib) is exposed to conditions for ring expansion and oxidized to yield compounds of formula I (Y = CH), which may be further derivatized.<br>
General Process C<br><br>
In this process, a nitro-anthranilic acid (Ic) or nitro-isotoic anhydride (He) is transformed to an intermediate amino acylbenzamide (Die). This intermediate is further transformed to the ortho-nitro cyclic imine (IVc). The imine and nitro functionalities are concomitantly reduced! followed by cyclization  with  an  acid<br><br>
/<br>
chloride, aldehyde, or reagent used to form a urea or thiourea yielding compounds of formula I (Y = N) or H (Z = 0, S).<br>
General Process D<br><br>
II<br>
Compounds of formula I (Y = N) or n (Z = O, S) can also be prepared via an alternative route from intermediate Va (Q = NO2). Nitro-anthranilic acid (Ic) is first converted to nitro-benzoic acid ester (Id), where X is a halide or an appropriate leaving group, followed by cyclization to Va with an appropriate ethylenediamine.<br>
More particularly, the following reaction schemes are useful in the preparation of the illustratedcompounds of the invention.<br><br><br>
Scheme 1:<br>
In this scheme, 2-nitroaniline A (R40 = H, F) is N-alkylated with acrylonitrile to yield B. The nitrile group of B is hydrolyzed to carboxylic acid C, which is subjected to Friedel-Craft-type intramolecular cyclization conditions to form ketone D. Nitro-ketone D is reduced to the diamino-ketone G, which undergoes cyclization to H (R1 = aryl, alkyl) when exposed to an acid chloride or aldehyde. Tricyclic ketone H can be transformed via a Schmidt-type reaction with NaN3 and acid to tricyclic lactam I. Alternatively and preferable, nitro-ketone D is first transformed to tricylic lactam E via the Schmidt reaction, reduced to diamino-lactam F, and further exposed to an acid chloride, aldehyde, CS2, thiophosgene, thiocarbonyl diimidazole or equivalent reagent to form I (R1 = aryl, alkyl, SH). Diamino-lactam F may also be converted to tricyclic lactam J when exposed to phosgene, carbonyl diimidazole or equivalent reagent. In all cases, I may be optionally modified at R1.<br><br><br>
Scheme la: Alternative Route to intermediate E<br>
In this scheme, 3-nitroanthranilic acid Z (R40 = H) is converted to methyl ester FF (R40 = H). Diazotization of the amino group of FF (R40 = H) and halogenation transforms it into bromide GG (R40 = H). The cyclic lactam E (R40 = H) is formed by displacement of the bromide and subsequent cyclization with ethylene diamine.<br>
Scheme 2:<br><br>
Here, 2-iodoaniline K is N-alkylated with (3-propiolactone to yield L, which is subjected to Friedel-Craft-type intramolecular cyclization conditions to form ketone M. Iodo-ketone M is transformed to iodo-lactam N via a Schmidt-type reaction with NaN3 and acid. Intermediate N is converted to the corresponding substituted acetylene O, where R1 is aryl, alkyl, H or -Si(alkyl)3, using a metal-catalyzed reaction, typically employing both palladium and copper(I). Tricyclic lactam P is formed by further exposing acetylene O to a metal-catalyzed reaction, typically using palladium.   P is<br><br>
optionally modified at R1 and R<br><br>
10<br><br><br>
Scheme 3:<br>
In this scheme, indoline Q is N-alkylated with acrylonitrile to yield R. The nitrile group of R is hydrolyzed to carboxylic acid S, which is subjected to Friedel-Craft-type intramolecular cyclization conditions to form ketone T. Tricyclic ketone T is exposed to Schmidt-type ring-expansion reaction conditions with NaN3 and acid to form tricyclic lactam U. Intermediate U is oxidized to produce V, which can then be further modified. For example, V can be halogenated or formylated to W, where R10 = I, CHO. In all cases W is optionally modified at R10. Product W may also be halogenated to product X, where the formula variable X is iodine. Product X can be transformed via a metal-catalyzed reaction (typically with palladium as catalyst) into a number of different tricyclic lactams P where R1 is aryl, etc. P may be optionally modified at R1 and R10<br><br><br><br>
Scheme 4:<br><br><br>
In this scheme, 3-nitroanthranilic acid Z (R40 = H) is converted sequentially to intermediate amide AA and cyclic imine BB, which are usually not isolated, but further subjected to hydrogenation to form cyclic diamino-lactam CC where R7 or R8 is H, alkyl, or aryl. When CC (one of R7 and R8 must be H) is further exposed to an acid chloride, aldehyde, CS2, thiophosgene, thiocarbonyl diimidazole or equivalent reagent, tricyclic lactam DD is formed (R1 = aryl, alkyl, SH; R7 or R8 = H, alkyl, or aryl.). Diamino-lactam CC may also be converted to tricyclic lactam EE when exposed to phosgene, carbonyl diimidazole or equivalent reagent. In all cases DD and EE are optionally modified at R1, R7, and/or R8. Examples<br>

PARP Enzyme Inhibition AssaYI<br>
The PARP enzyme-inhibiting activities of the compounds were assayed as described by Simonin et al. (J. Biol. Chem. (1993), 268:8529-8535) and Marsischky et al. (J. Biol. Chem. (1995), 270:3247-3254) with minor modifications as follows. Samples (50 uL) containing 20 nM purified PARP protein, 10 ug/mL DNAse I-activated calf thymus DNA (sigma), 500 uM NAD+, 0.5 uCi [32P]NAD+, 2% DMSO, an&amp; various concentrations oi test comptfcmrj^ ^vere incubated in sampie "antfer (5ti mM Tris pH 8.0, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM tris(carboxyethyl)phosphineHCl) at 25°C for 5 minutes. Under these conditions, the reaction rate was linear for times up to 10 minutes. The reaction was stopped by the addition of an equal volume of ice-cold 40%<br><br>
trichloroacetic acid to the samples, which were then incubated on ice for 15 minutes. The samples were then transferred to a Bio-Dot microfiltration apparatus (BioRad), filtered through Whatman GF/C glass-fiber filter paper, washed 3 times with 150 u.L of wash buffer (5% trichloroacetic acid, 1% inorganic pyrophosphate), and dried. [32P]ADP-Ribose incorporation into the acid-m;uluble material was quantitated using a Phosphorlmager (Molecular Dynamics) and ImageQuant software. Inhibition constants (Ki) were calculated by non-linear regression analyses using the velocity equation for competitive inhibition (Segel, Enzyme Kinetics: Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-State Enzyme Systems, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York (1975), 100-125). In the case of tight-binding inhibitors, 5 nM enzyme was used and the reaction was incubated at 25°C for 25 minutes. Kj values for tight-binding inhibitors were calculated using the equation described Sculley et al. {Biochim. Biophys. Acta (1986), 874:44-53).<br>
Cytotoxicity Potentiation Assay.<br>
A549 cells (ATCC, Rockville, MD) were seeded into 96-well cell culture plates (Falcon brand, Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) 16 to 24 hours before experimental manipulation. Cells were then treated with a test compound (or a combination of test compounds where indicated) each at a concentration of 0.4 uM for either 3 days or 5 days. At the end of treatments, relative cell number was determined either by MTT assay or SRB assay. For the MTT assay, 0.2 ug/nl of MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazoI-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) was added to each well of a plate, and the plate was incubated in a cell-culture incubator for 4 hours. Metabolized MTT in each well was solubilized in 150 fil of DMSO (Sigma Chemical Co.) with shaking and quantified with a Wallac 1420 Victor plate reader (EG&amp;G Wallac, Gaithersburg, MD) at 540 nm. For the SRB assay, cells were fixed with 10% trichloroacetic acid (Sigma Chemical Co) for an hour at 4°C. After extensively washing, fixed cells were stained for 30 minutes with 0.4% sulforhodamine B (SRB, Sigma Chemical Co.) in 1% acetic acid (Sigma Chemical Co).  Unbound SRB was washed away with 1% acetic acid. Then the cultures were<br><br>
air-dried, and bound dye was solubilized with 10 mM unbuffered Tris base (Sigma Chemical Co) with shaking. The bound dye was measured photometrically with the Wallac Victor plate reader at 515 nm. The ratio of the OD (optical density) value of a compound-treated culture to the OD value of a mock-treated culture, expressed in percentage, was used to quantify the cytotoxicity of a compound. The concentration at which a compound causes 50% cytotoxicity is referred to as IC50. To quantify the potentiation of the cytotoxicity of topotecan or temozolomide by test compounds, a dimensionless parameter PF50 is used and is defined as the ratio of the IC50 of topotecan or temozolomide alone to the IC50 of topotecan or temozolomide in combination with a test compound. For the compounds of the invention, PF50 values were determined by testing with topotecan.<br>
