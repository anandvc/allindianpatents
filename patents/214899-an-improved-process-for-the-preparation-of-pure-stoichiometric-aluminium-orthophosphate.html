				<td>This invention relates to an improved process for the prepa¬ration of pure stoichioroetric aluminium Orthophosphate useful as catalyst, catalyst support and as an ingredient for the prepara¬tion of Radiation sensitive phosphate glasses.<br>
In the case of heterogeneous catalysis of chemical  reaction<br>
aluminium Orthophosphate (A1PO4 ) refered here in after as alumini-<br>
um phosphate, is well known through its acid-base properties either as a catalyst or a catalyst support. However its acidic or base character varies with the variation of its A1:P:0 = 1:1:4 stoichiometry. In fact, stoichiometric aluminium phosphate where A1:P:0 = 1:1:4, is more an acidic catalyst than a basic catalyst and can be used to prepare nitrided aluminium phosphate (A1PON) which is a strongly basic catalyst.<br>
In ceramic field on the other hand, pure aluminium phosphate is used in making various radiation sensitive glasses like Radio photoluminescence glasses, laser glasses etc. The sensitivity to radiation of such glasses is also found to be dependent on the purity as well as A1:P stoichiometry of the aluminium phosphate used.<br>
So pure stoichiometric aluminium phosphate is a widely demad-ing material all over the world. Unfortunately, most of the com¬mercially available aluminium phosphates are not stoichiometric even in respect of A1:P ratio and are frequently found to contain<br>
aluminium metaphosphate [AlfPO3 )3 ], free aluminum (Al2 O3 ) etc.  as<br><br>
impurities.<br><br>
The methods which are presently used for the preparation of stoichiometric aluminium phosphate are (1) a method due to Stephen T. Wilson etal disclosed in an U.S. Patent No 4310440 and (2) a controlled reaction method using alkene oxide, recently reported in a paper in the Journal "High Temp Chem Processes" I (1992) P-157.<br>
In the  first method aluminium phosphate crystals  stuffed<br>
o with organic amines are hydrothermally grown at 100-300 C from a<br>
gel  formed by adding an organic templating agents  like  organic amines  or quarternary ammonium salts to a mixture of  an  active<br>
form of alumina (Al2 O3 ), Orthophosphoric acid (H3 PO4 ) and water.<br><br>
The  'pH' of the mixture is kept in between 5-8.  Pure  aluminium<br>
phosphate  (microporous)  are then obtained by calcining the<br>
stuffed crystals at 400-600o C.<br>
In the second method amorphous and highly dispersed aluminium phosphate is prepared by slowly adding suitable amount of propyl-<br>
ene oxide to a vigorously stirred A1C1 ,6H O/H PO   (M)  mixture<br><br>
cooled to 0o C. After standing several hours, the transperent gel<br>
is thoroughly washed with propanol-2, dried and calcined in the<br>
 temperature range 500-800oC.<br>
However, the major disadvantages of the existing methods described above are (1) they are very expensive and (2) tedious.<br>
Therefore, the main objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of stoichiometric aluminium phosphate which is simpler and less expensive compared<br><br>
to the existing methods.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an improved process for the preparation of stoichiometric aluminum orthophosphate (AlPO4) useful as acid-base catalyst, which comprises:<br>
a)	preparing a homogeneous solution of a water soluble aluminum salt as herein<br>
described in the concentration range of 0.2 - 0.5 M in deionised water,<br>
b)	preparing a homogeneous solution of a water soluble phosphate salt as herein<br>
described in the concentration range of 0.2 - 0.5 M in deionised water,<br>
c)	preparing a homogeneous mixture of the above two solution keeping aluminum<br>
cation and phosphate anion concentration ratio 1:1 in the total mixture,<br>
d)	precipitating the aluminum phosphate gel out of the mixture by controlling the pH<br>
of the mixture at pH ~ 6 by adding a buffer such as herein described,<br>
e)	washing the gel repeatedly first with deionized water and then with a water<br>
miscible organic solvent as herein described,<br>
f)	removing the absorbed water out of the gel as far as practicable by washing with a<br>
dry water-miscible organic solvent as herein described,<br>
g)	drying the material to obtain the product.<br>
Aluminum salt used may be chosen out of aluminum trichloride (AlCl3), aluminum sulphate A l2(SO4)3, aluminum nitrate Al (NO3)3 and the like.<br>
The water soluble phosphate salt used may be selected from sodium dihydrogen phosphate NaH2PO4 disodium hydrogen phosphate Na2HPO4, potassium dihydrogen phosphate KH2PO4, ammonium dihydrogen phosphate NH4H2PO4 and the like. The buffer solution used may be chosen from known buffers like sodium dihydrogen phosphate ± citric acid, sodium acetate + acetic acid, potassium dihydrogen phosphate + sodium hydroxide and the like. The organic solvent used for washing and dehydrating aluminum phosphate gel may be selected from dry methanol, ethanol, acetone, glycerol and the like.<br>
The drying may be affected by keeping the product in a desicator. The yield of the stoichiometric aluminum phosphate was found to be in between 60-70% depending on the ingredients used.<br>
The product is an amorphous powder and can be converted into its various crystalline variety by heat treatment.<br>
The details of the invention is described in the examples given below which are provided by way of illustration only and should not be construed to limit the scope of the invention.<br>
Example - 1<br>
Stoichiometric aluminum phosphate can be prepared by making a homogeneous mixture of 0.3 (M) aqueous deionised solution of aluminum trichloride and 0.3 (M) aqueous deionised solution of potassium dihydrogen phosphate in a ratio such that the Al (+3) cation and PO4 (-3) anion content in the mixture becomes 1:1,<br>
then precipitating out the aluminium phosphate gel through controlling the pH of the mixture around pH ≈ 6 using a buffer of  potassium dihydrogen phosphate and sodium hydroxide.<br>
The precipitate is repeatedly washed with deionised water and then with methanol and finally filtered off. The gel may be further dehydrated by washing with pure dry acetone and keeping in desiccator. The product is highly dispersed and stoichiomet¬ric, yield 65%.<br>
Example -2<br>
Stoichiometric aluminium phosphate can also be prepared by using a 2:1 mixture respectively of 0.2(M) aqueous (deionised) solution of disodium hydrogen posphate and 0.2 (M) aqueous solu¬tion of aluminium sulphate and precipitating the aluminium phos¬phate gel by controlling the pH of the mixture around pH^e with the help of a buffer of sodium acetate and acetic acid.<br>
The precipitated gel is repeatedly washed with deionised water and the analytical grade acetone and finally filtered off. The material is then further dehydrated by repeatedly washing with dry acetone and keeping in desiccator. The product is perfectly stoichiometric and shows all desired properties, yield 60%.<br>
Example - 3<br>
Stoichiometric aluminium phosphate may be prepared also by using a 1:1 homogeneous mixture of 0.5(M) acqueous (deionised) solution of ammonium dihydrogen phosphate and 0.5(M) aqueous (deionised) solution of aluminium nitrate and precipitating out the aluminium phosphate gel by controlling the pH at around pH 6<br>
with the help of a buffer of sodium dihydrogen phosphate  and citric acid.<br>
The precipitated gel similar to the previuos methods is washed repeatedly with deionised water and then with pure acetone and filtered under suction and finally dehydrated by washing with dry acetone and keeping in a desiccator. The product in this case is also found to be highly dispersed and stoichiometric yield 71%.<br>
