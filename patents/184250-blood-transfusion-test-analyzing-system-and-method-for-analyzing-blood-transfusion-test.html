				<td>[Detailed Explanation of the Invention]<br>
[Technological Field of the Invention]<br>
This invention relates to a blood transfusion test<br>
analyzing system and a method for examining adaptability of<br>
blood transfusion before blood is transfused to a patient in a<br>
facility such as a hospital.<br>
[0002]<br>
[Prior Art]<br>
It is necessary to perform various tests including an ABO<br>
blood typing test in order to avoid agglutination of blood or<br>
laky blood occurred by an antigen-antibody reaction between<br>
patient's blood and provided blood when blood is transfused to<br>
a patient in a hospital.<br>
[0003]<br>
Especially, when irregular antibodies should be<br>
identified, it is checked up whether agglutination occurs or<br>
not between blood to be examined and plural kinds of reagent<br>
red blood cells after selecting the plural kinds of reagent<br>
red blood cells based on the reference to an antigen profile<br>
"table 'Based on the result of the checkup, other kinds of<br>
reagent red blood cells are selected and used for identifying<br>
irregular antibodies. Conventionally, such an antigen profile<br>
table is printed on a paper attached to a group of plurality<br>
of kinds of reagent red blood cells when it is sold. A person<br>
such as a clinical test technician selects an appropriate<br>
combination of kinds of reagent red blood cells referring to<br>
the antigen profile based on his or her experience.<br>
[0004]<br>
However, selection of an appropriate combination of kinds<br>
of reagent blood cells is a troublesome work. Sometimes, the<br>
selection must be performed in a short period at the facility.<br>
P'urther, a decision of the test performed by a person depends<br>
on the individual differences. Therefore, it is difficult to<br>
accurately perform an objective identification of antibodies.<br>
[0005]<br>
[Problem to be solved]<br>
As explained above, a blood test for blood transfusion is<br>
very troublesome and it is difficult to make an objective<br>
judgement of blood test accurately.<br>
[0006]<br>
The present invention is made in view of the above<br>
explained points. Accordingly, the object of the present<br>
invention is to provide a blood test analyzing system which<br>
aids a test technician so that the technician can easily<br>
perform decisions concerning a blood transfusion test such as<br>
antibody identification.<br>
[0007]<br>
[Means for Solving Problem]<br>
In order to accomplish the above object, the blood<br>
transfusion test analyzing system according to the present<br>
invention comprises: a center station having an antigen<br>
profile information of reagent red blood cells and a local<br>
station installed at a facility where a blood transfusion test<br>
is performed by using the reagent red blood cells, the local<br>
station being connected to the center station via a data<br>
transmission line; wherein the center station includes antigen<br>
profile information inputting means for inputting antigen<br>
profile information of reagent red blood cells to be<br>
distributed to the facility and an antigen profile data<br>
transferring means for transferring the input antigen profile<br>
information to the local station via the data transmission<br>
line; and Wherein the local station includes an antigen<br>
profile information receiving means for receiving the antigen<br>
profile information transferred from the center station, a<br>
storing means for storing the antigen profile information<br>
received by the antigen profile information receiving means, a<br>
blood transfusion test result inputting means for inputting a<br>
result of a blood transfusion test performed by using the<br>
reagent red blood cells and a blood transfusion test analyzing<br>
means for analyzing the blood transfusion test based on the<br>
result of the blood transfusion test and the antigen profile<br>
information stored in the storing means.<br>
[0C08]<br>
Further, a method for analyzing a blood transfusion test<br>
using reagent red blood cells according to the present<br>
invention comprises the steps of: transmitting antigen profile<br>
information concerning the reagent red blood cells from a<br>
center station having the antigen profile information to a<br>
local station installed at a blood transfusion test facility<br>
via a data transmission line; receiving the antigen profile<br>
information at the local station via the data transmission<br>
line; carrying out a blood transfusion test at the blood<br>
transfusion test facility using the reagent red blood cells;<br>
and analyzing the blood transfusion test at the local station<br>
based on the antigen 'profile information received by the local<br>
station and a result of the blood transfusion test.<br>
[0009]<br>
[embodiments of the present invention]<br>
Next, embodiments of the present invention are explained<br>
in detail with reference to the drawings.<br>
Fig, 1 is a figure showing a structure of the blood<br>
transfusion test system according to an embodiment of the<br>
present invention. In this Fig., reference numeral 100 denotes<br>
a center station which inputs antigen profile information and<br>
which transmits the antigen profile information via a public<br>
telephone line 300, 200a and 200b respectively denote a<br>
facility station which receives the antigen profile<br>
information transmitted by the center station 100. The center<br>
station 100 includes a host computer 110, terminal computer<br>
120a and a terminal computer 120b. Printers 130a, 130b are<br>
connected to the terminal computers 120a, 120b respectively. A<br>
modem 150 is connected to the host computer 110 so that the<br>
host computer can communicate with an external apparatus. A<br>
bar code reader 140 is connected to the terminal computer<br>
120b. The host computer 110 includes a main frame portion 111<br>
in which a CPU is mounted, and a hard disk 112.<br>
[0010]<br>
On the other hand, facility stations 200a and 200b,<br>
installed at facilities such as a hospital are connected to<br>
the public telephone line 300. In Fig. 1, only two facility<br>
stations are illustrated. However, it is possible that more<br>
than two facility stations are connected to the public<br>
telephone line 300. Here, only the functions of the facility<br>
stations 200a is explained as an example because the facility<br>
stations 200a and 200b are substantially the same. The<br>
facility station 200a includes a terminal computer 201a, a<br>
printer 202a connected to the terminal computer 201a, a bar<br>
code reader 203a and a modem 204a which is connected to the<br>
public telephone line 300. The reference numeral 205a denotes<br>
an image processing apparatus which inputs an image of a test<br>
reaction of the a reagent cassette.<br>
[0011]<br>
Fig. 2 is an illustrative figure showing operations of<br>
the distribution of the reagent red blood cells or reagent<br>
cassettes to each of the facilities and the transferring of<br>
antigen profile information of the reagent red blood cells and<br>
reagent cassettes performed by the center station 100. As<br>
shown in Fig. 2, reagent red blood cells and reagent cassettes<br>
are delivered to the facilities such as a hospital and the<br>
information concerning reagent blood cells and reagent<br>
cassettes are stored in reagent red blood cell data base which<br>
is structured in the hard disk 112 of the host computer 110 of<br>
the center station 100. The kinds of the antigen composition,<br>
lot numbers, doner numbers of the reagent blood cells, which<br>
are used for antibody screening and for antibody<br>
identification, are registered in this reagent blood cell data<br>
base. The antigen profile information is manually input by a<br>
person with reference to an antigen profile table printed on a<br>
paper. The same antigen profile is input based on the same<br>
antigen profile table plurality of times and a supervisor<br>
confirms the input antigen profile information, thereby<br>
accurate information can be obtained. The information<br>
concerning the reagent red blood cells including the antigen<br>
profile information is automatically transmitted to the<br>
facilities to which the reagent red blood cells or reagent<br>
cassettes are delivered via the modem 150 and the public<br>
telephone line 300 at a predetermined time during night for<br>
example. The information concerning the reagent red blood<br>
cells should be reached to the facility prior to the arrival<br>
ot the reagent red blood cells to the facility. When a<br>
malfunction occurs in transmitting the information concerning<br>
the reagent red blood cells, a list of the pieces of<br>
information which have not properly been transmitted to the<br>
facilities is displayed on a display screen of the host<br>
computer 110. In addition, a procedure of re-transmitting the<br>
information is performed. The information concerning reagent<br>
red blood cells including the antigen profile is stored in a<br>
floppy disk and the floppy disk is sent to the facilities<br>
which do not have a communication device such as a modem. The<br>
floppy disk may be sent even to the facilities having a<br>
Communication device as a security measure in case a<br>
Communication cannot be made due to the malfunction of the<br>
communication network or a trouble of the modem. The<br>
operations of the facility station 200a can be performed on-<br>
line from the center station 100. Namely, remote maintenance<br>
of data base and so forth can be executed.<br>
[0012]<br>
Next, the operations of the facility station 200a<br>
installed in a hospital and so forth will be explained.<br>
Fig. 3 is a figure illustrating the operations of the<br>
facility station 200a. As shown in Fig. 3, analysis of the<br>
test result for a patient and administration of the history of<br>
the test result are performed based on the information<br>
concerning the reagent red blood cells v/hich are transmitted<br>
by the center station 100. Blood tests include an ABD blood<br>
typing 'test, DAT (Direct Anti-globulin Test), an Rh-hr factor<br>
test, an irregular antibody test, a cross-matching test and an<br>
antibody identification test. There tests will be explained in<br>
detail later.<br>
[0013]<br>
The facility station 200a receives the information<br>
concerning the reagent red blood cells including the antigen<br>
profile information transmitted by the center station 100 or<br>
the facility station 200a receives a floppy disk containing<br>
the information concerning the reagent red blood cells<br>
including the antigen profile information. The necessary<br>
information is extracted from the reagent red blood cell<br>
information and is stored in the reagent red blood cell data<br>
base. As a test specimen reception and registration procedure,<br>
patient (recipient of blood) information and test specimen<br>
information are registered. In addition, requested test items<br>
are set. Further-, the reagent cassettes are reserved to use.<br>
The information concerning the reagent cassettes is input by<br>
reading a bar code with the bar code reader 203a.<br>
[0014]<br>
Fig. 4 is a figure showing an outlook of an example of a<br>
reagent cassette 400. As shown in this Fig., columns 401 to<br>
406 are provided on the reagent cassette 400. Anti-A serum,<br>
anti-B serum and anti-D serum are sealed into the columns 401<br>
to 403 respectively. Different phosphoric acid buffers are<br>
sealed into columns 404 to 406 respectively. An ID number for<br>
specifying the reagent cassette 400, an ID number for<br>
specifying anti serums sealed into the columns 401 to 406 and<br>
other ID numbers are recorded as bar code information. In<br>
using this reagent cassette 400 the state of the<br>
agglutination after centrifugals force is' applied to the<br>
reagent cassette 400 after red blood: cells as test specimens<br>
are put into the columns 401 to 406 indicates a result of the<br>
test. Glass beads which are minute particles are sealed into<br>
the columns 401 to 406 in order to make the state of the<br>
agglutination clearer. Namely, agglutinated red blood cells<br>
are captured by glass beads which show a filtering effect. On<br>
the other hand, non-agglutinated red blood cells subsides at<br>
the bottoms of the columns 401 to 406 by passing through the<br>
glass beads.<br>
[0015]<br>
A reagent cassette 500 shown in Fig. 5 is similar to the<br>
reagent cassette 400. However, polyspecific coombs serum<br>
(mixture of anti-IgG serum, anti-C3b serum and anti-C3d serum)<br>
is sealed into the columns 501 to 506. A result of the test<br>
can be found by observing the state of agglutination after<br>
reagent red blood ceils and blood of a patient are poured in<br>
the columns. A bar code 510 is printed on the surface of the<br>
reagent cassette 500, which is similar to the bar code 410<br>
illustrated in Fig. 4.<br>
[0016]<br>
Namely, the information about the reagent cassettes is<br>
input by reading the bar codes 410 and 510 with the bar code<br>
reader 203a at. the facility station 200a. As a test result of<br>
a specimen test at the facility station 200a, the result of<br>
the test using the reagent cassette 400 or 500, i.e.,,. each<br>
state of agglutination of the columns 40l to 406 of the<br>
reagent cassette 400 and of the columns 501 to 506 of the<br>
reagent cassette 500 is input by eye sight of a test<br>
performing person. Alternatively, each state of agglutination<br>
may be input automatically by an image processing apparatus<br>
205a having a CCD camera for example. In this case, the image<br>
processing apparatus 205a takes an image of the columns and<br>
inputs the state of agglutination of the columns by image<br>
processing. The image processing apparatus 205a makes a<br>
decision of a test result using an image processing algorithm<br>
working based on change of colors in the columns 401 to 406<br>
and 501 to 506. The decision of the test result is transferred<br>
to the terminal computer 201a. By inputting test results as<br>
explained above, a judgement of a result of an ABD typing<br>
test, DAT (Direct Anti-globulin test), an Rh-hr factor test<br>
and a cross-matching test are performed. The results of the<br>
specimen tests are stored in patient information data base and<br>
specimen information data base. Retrieval of the information<br>
stored in each data base is possible. In the patient<br>
information data base, patient information is stored with<br>
patient IDs for specifying patients. In the specimen<br>
information data base, specimen information is stored with<br>
specimen IDs for specifying specimens. An elimination method<br>
is applied to the antigen profile information included in<br>
reagent red blood cell information based on the input states<br>
of agglutination of the columns 401 to 406 and 501 to 506 of<br>
the reagent cassettes 400 and 500, thereby antibody whose<br>
existence seems to be likely and antibody whose existence<br>
cannot be denied are displayed. In addition, probabilities of<br>
the identified antibodies are calculated and displayed.<br>
Further, when supplemental reagent blood cells are necessary<br>
to identify antibodies, A list of proposed kinds of reagent<br>
blood cells is displayed based on the antigen profile<br>
information.<br>
[0017]<br>
Next, the operations of the facility station 200a will be<br>
explained more in detail. Fig. 6 is a flowchart showing the<br>
operations at the time of the initiation. The program runs on<br>
the Windows NT which is an operating system of Microsoft<br>
cooperation. As shown in this figure, a password for opening<br>
Windows NT is input (step ST601), and a password for Data<br>
Management Program (DMP) is input (step ST602) . When these<br>
passwords are in conformity with the stored passwords<br>
respectively, a main menu is displayed (step ST603) . When the<br>
reagent red blood cell reception procedure is selected in the<br>
main menu, the sequence shifts to this procedure (step ST604).<br>
VJhen the specimen reception procedure is selected in the main<br>
menu, the sequence shifts to this procedure (step ST605) . When<br>
the result input procedure is selected in the main menu, the<br>
sequence shifts--to.-this procedure (step ST606). When the<br>
identification procedure is selected in the main menu, the<br>
sequence shifts to this procedure (step ST607). The detailed<br>
explanations of steps ST604 to ST607 will be explained later.<br>
When the utility is selected in the main menu (step ST608),<br>
either a data base maintenance procedure or a document<br>
printing procedure can be selected. When the data base<br>
maintenance procedure is selected, the sequence shifts to this<br>
procedure (step ST609). When the document printing procedure<br>
is selected (step ST610), one among blood transfusion history-<br>
retrieval (step ST611), test result retrieval (step ST612) and<br>
patient information retrieval (step ST613) can be selected. In<br>
these retrievals, after inputting retrieval conditions (step<br>
ST614), the retrieval is performed and the result of the<br>
retrieval is displayed (steps ST615, ST616). When the result<br>
should be printed on a paper (step ST617), the retrieved data<br>
are printed on a paper (step ST618). On the other hand, it is<br>
not necessary to print the retrieved data on a paper, the<br>
sequence shifts back to step ST614. In step ST619, when the<br>
document printing procedure is terminated, the sequence shifts<br>
back to step ST603 where the main menu of the data management<br>
program is displayed. When "quit" is selected at the step<br>
ST603 (step ST620), the sequence shifts back to the main menu<br>
of the Windows NT.<br>
Fig. 7 is a flowchart showing the operations of the step<br>
ST604 of Fig. 6 in greater detail. At first, when the reagent<br>
red blood cells are received, either the reagent red blood<br>
cell information stored in a distributed floppy disk (steps<br>
ST701 ST702) or the reagent red blood cell information<br>
received via the modem 204a (step ST703) is selected to read.<br>
Next, when transmission date of reagent red blood cell<br>
information for the received reagent red blood cells and lot<br>
numbers are selected (steps ST704, ST705), selection for the<br>
registration is performed (step ST706). When the registration<br>
is executed, the whole procedure is terminated and the<br>
sequence shifts back to the main menu of the data management<br>
program.<br>
[0019]<br>
Fig. 8 is a flowchart showing the operations of the step<br>
ST605 of Fig. 6 in greater detail. At first, when a new<br>
specimen is to be registered (step ST801), a patient ID is<br>
input and information including the name of the patient and<br>
birth date of the patient is registered (steps ST802, ST803),<br>
a specimen ID is input and specimen information as to whether<br>
anti-coagulant is included or not for example is input (step<br>
ST805) and requested items for the test is input (step ST806).<br>
On the other hand, in a case where information of the specimen<br>
which has been registered should be added, a patient ID is<br>
 input (step ST808) . When the patient information should be<br>
added or changed, registering procedure for the patient<br>
information is performed (steps ST809, ST810). Next,<br>
registration of a specimen ID is performed (step ST811) and<br>
the sequence shifts to the input procedure for requested test<br>
items (step ST806). Subsequently, registration procedure for<br>
reagent cassette to be used is performed (steps ST812 to<br>
ST815). If it is not necessary to add or change other<br>
information (steps ST816 to ST817), when the whole procedures<br>
should be terminated, the sequence shifts back to the main<br>
menu. On the other hand, when the whole procedures should not<br>
be terminated, the sequence shifts back to the step ST605<br>
(step ST818). When patient information is not to be added or<br>
changed, a specimen ID is input (step ST819) and specimen<br>
information is input (step ST820). Further, the registration<br>
procedure of requested items for the test and the registration<br>
procedure of the reagent cassette are performed (steps ST821<br>
to ST825).<br>
[0020]<br>
Fig. 9 is a flowchart showing the operations of the step<br>
ST606 of Fig. 6 in greater detail. At first, IDs of the<br>
reagent cassettes are input manually or with the bar code<br>
reader (steps ST901 and ST902). The information concerning the<br>
reagent cassettes is stored in the reagent cassette data base<br>
with reagent cassette IDs so that the information can be<br>
retrieved. If the reagent cassette has already been<br>
registered, a specimen information input window is displayed<br>
(step ST903) and results of the tests are input (step ST904).<br>
When the results are not registered, judgements of blood tests<br>
including ABD, Rh-hr, DAT blood tests are made (steps ST906).<br>
The judging operations of these tests are explained later in<br>
greater detail. As a result of these blood tests, when an<br>
abnormal reaction occurs (step ST907), possible causes are<br>
displayed. Abnormal patterns in each of the tests and causes<br>
of the abnormal patterns are related to each other and stored<br>
in the abnormal cause data base structured in the hard disk of<br>
the computer 201a at the facility station 200a and the<br>
possible causes are displayed after retrieving the possible<br>
causes from the abnormal cause data base (ST908). When the<br>
input results of the tests are registered at step ST905 or<br>
when it is decided that no abnormalities occur at step ST907,<br>
the information is input as to whether there are the reagent<br>
cassettes which have not been input or not (step ST909). If<br>
there is such a reagent cassette, the sequence shifts back to<br>
the step ST901. On the other hand, if the reagent cassette<br>
which has not been input does not remain, a special dialog<br>
window is displayed (step ST910). In this window, one among<br>
dialog windows for cross-matching and irregular antibody, and<br>
antibody identification initial window can be selected (step<br>
ST912). The step of inputting test results can be reached from<br>
the specimen reception and registration window (step ST913)<br>
through the display of specimen information window (step<br>
ST913). Namely, an input of cassette ID is performed by<br>
selecting a cassette ID from cassette IDs in the pull-down<br>
list on the specimen reception and registration window (step<br>
ST915). Thereafter, the sequence shifts to-the step ST904<br>
where the test results can be input.<br>
[0021]<br>
-Fig. 10 is a figure showing a window for inputting<br>
results of specimen tests. As shown in the center portion of<br>
this figure, results of each columns are input and registered.<br>
The results of the tests are indicated as one of "0", "W+",<br>
"1+", "2+", "3+", "4+" respectively depending on the degree of<br>
the states of agglutination.<br>
[0022]<br>
Figs. 11 and 12 are flowcharts showing the detailed<br>
operations of antibody identification procedure in the step<br>
ST607 of Fig. 6. After a specimen ID is input from the main<br>
menu (step STll0l) or the sequence shifts from a test result<br>
input window (step ST1102), identification mode is input (step<br>
ST1103). Thereafter, selection of reagent red blood cells to<br>
be used and identification are performed using an elimination<br>
method (steps ST1104 to ST1106). This identification procedure<br>
is performed mainly for the purpose of screening irregular<br>
antibodies. Therefore, a few kinds of reagent red blood cells<br>
are used for identification. In this case, coincidence of<br>
likely antibody pattern is obtained at the step ST1107, an<br>
antibody existence probability value (p-value) is calculated<br>
and meaning of the probability and mathematical expression for<br>
this calculation are displayed (steps ST1108 and ST1109). When<br>
the coincidence of likely antibody pattern is not obtained,<br>
causes of the fact that there are no coincidence of likely<br>
antibody pattern are displayed (step STlllO).<br>
[0023]<br>
Next, when "continue" is selected (step STllll), the<br>
selection of the reagent red blood cells to be used is<br>
performed (step ST1112). In this selection, plural kinds of<br>
reagent red blood cells stored in the facility are displayed<br>
so that a test performing person can select some kinds of<br>
reagent red blood cells. Therefore, this eases the selection<br>
of reagent red blood cells. A test is performed by using the<br>
selected reagent red blood cells and judgement of<br>
identification of antibody is performed with an elimination<br>
method (steps ST1113 and ST1114). Further, when coincidence of<br>
likely antibody pattern is obtained at the step ST1115,<br>
antibody existence probability value (p-value) is calculated<br>
and meaning of the probability and mathematical expression for<br>
this calculation are displayed (steps ST1116 and ST1117). When<br>
the coincidence of likely antibody pattern is not obtained,<br>
causes of the fact that there are no coincidence of likely<br>
antibody pattern are displayed (step ST1118)<br>
[0024]<br>
Next, when "continue" is selected (step ST1119), whether<br>
or not antigen typing 'is to be performed or not is selected<br>
(step ST1120). When the antigen typing is selected to perform,<br>
antigen typing to the antigen corresponding to the antibody<br>
whose existence is not denied and the result of the antigen<br>
typing is input (step ST1121). Taking this result of the<br>
antigen typing into account, identification of antibodies is<br>
performed (step ST1122). In this case, if a certain antigen<br>
.which corresponds to antibody whose existence cannot be denied<br>
is identified, the existence of the antibody is practically<br>
denied. Further, when coincidence of likely antibody pattern<br>
is obtained at the step ST1123, antibody existence probability<br>
value (p-value) is calculated and meaning of the probability<br>
and mathematical expression for this calculation are displayed<br>
(steps ST1124 and ST1125). When the coincidence of likely<br>
antibody pattern is not obtained, causes of the fact that<br>
there are no coincidence of likely antibody pattern are<br>
displayed (step ST1126).<br>
[0025]<br>
Next, when "continue" is selected (step ST1127), a<br>
selection of reagent red blood cells to be used is performed<br>
(step ST1128). In selection procedure of reagent red blood<br>
cells to be used, a proposed combination of plural kinds of<br>
reagent red blood cells is displayed, which include kinds of<br>
the reagent red blood cells which show positive to only one of<br>
antibodies which cannot be eliminated and kinds of the reagent<br>
red blood cells which show negative to the antibodies which<br>
cannot be eliminated. A test performing person selects reagent<br>
red blood cells among the proposed combination and a test is<br>
carried out using the selected reagent blood cells. Therefore,<br>
this eases the selection of reagent blood cells to be used<br>
next. The result of the test using the selected reagent red<br>
blood cells is input (step ST1129). A judgement of the test is<br>
performed using an elimination method (steps ST1130 and<br>
ST1131). In this case, coincidence of likely antibody pattern<br>
is obtained (step ST1132), antibody existence probability<br>
value (p-value) is calculated and meaning of the probability<br>
and mathematical expression for this calculation are displayed<br>
(steps ST1133 and ST1134). When the coincidence of likely<br>
antibody pattern is not obtained, causes of the fact that<br>
there are no coincidence of likely antibody pattern and<br>
reasons why the judgement cannot be possible are displayed<br>
(steps ST1135 and ST1136). The sequences from the step ST1134<br>
and from the step ST1136 shift to the step ST1137 where the<br>
result of antibody identification is stored and the whole<br>
procedure is terminated.<br>
[0026]<br>
Fig. 13 is a figure showing a window where antibody<br>
identification is performed referring to antigen profile<br>
(antigram (trademark)) with an elimination method. As shown in<br>
the lower portion of the figure, antibodies whose existence is<br>
considered to be likely and antibodies whose existence cannot<br>
be denied are displayed with probability values.<br>
[0027]<br>
Fig. 14 is a figure showing a window where antibody<br>
identification is performed using supplemental reagent red<br>
blood,cells after the antibody identification indicated in<br>
Fig. 13 is completed. As shown in Fig. 14, antibodies whose<br>
existences are considered to be likely and antibodies whose<br>
existences cannot be denied are different from those indicated<br>
in Fig. 13. Further, in the current window indicated in Fig.<br>
14, how the probability of existence of E antibody is<br>
calculated is displayed. Namely, probability of identification<br>
of antibody is calculated based on the mathematical expression<br>
indicated at the bottom line of the current window of Fig. 14.<br>
[0028]<br>
Fig. 15 is a flowchart showing the operations of the ABO<br>
typing which is a test among the blood tests of the step ST906<br>
of Fig. 9. As shown in Fig. 15, it is judged whether the<br>
reaction is normal or abnormal for each of the forward test<br>
and backward test of the ABO typing test (steps ST1501, ST1502<br>
and ST1503). Further, it is judged whether the result of the<br>
forward test and the result of the backward test are<br>
coincident or not for all combinations of the tests (steps<br>
ST1504 to ST1507). The forward test is defined to be a test of<br>
patient's blood cells. Namely, in the forward test, anti-A<br>
serum (B type serum) and anti-B serum (A type serum) are used<br>
for determining the existence of A antigen and B antigen on<br>
the surfaces of the blood cells of the patient. The backward<br>
test is defined to be a test of patient's serum. Namely, in<br>
the backward test, standard A type red blood cells and<br>
standard B type red blood cells are used for determining the<br>
existenue of anti-A and anti-B antibodies included in the<br>
patient's serum (step ST1508). Only when both the forward test<br>
and the backward test show a normal reaction and the result of<br>
the forward test is identical to that of the backward test,<br>
the judgement of ABO typing becomes definite (step ST1508). On<br>
the other hand, when the result of the forward test is not<br>
identical to that of the backward test, the judgement is<br>
suspended (steps ST1509 and ST1511) and major causes of<br>
inconsistency of the forward test and backward test are<br>
displayed (step ST1513). At least one of the forward test and<br>
backward test does not show a normal reaction although the<br>
results of the forward test and backward test are consistent,<br>
the result is decided to be provisional (steps ST1510 and<br>
ST1512) and major causes of the fact that an abnormal reaction<br>
occurs are displayed (step ST1514).<br>
[0029]<br>
Fig. 16 is a flowchart showing operations of the<br>
judgement of the Rho (D) test which is a test among the blood<br>
tests of the step ST906 of Fig. 9. In this test, blood having<br>
D antigen is classified as Rh(+) and blood not having D<br>
antigen is classified as Rh(-). As shown in Fig. 16, when the<br>
reaction of the anti-D column of the reagent cassette shows<br>
positive (step ST1601), the reaction is strongly positive<br>
(step ST1602) and the reaction of the control column is<br>
negative (step ST1603), the test of Rho (D) is decided to be<br>
positive (step ST1604) However, when strongly positive<br>
reaction is not: obtained at the step ST1602 and the reaction<br>
of the control column shows negative (step ST1605), the<br>
judgement of the test is decided to be provisionally positive<br>
(step ST1605) and major causes of the fact that a weak<br>
reaction occurs (step ST1607). When the reaction of the anti-D<br>
column shows negative (step ST1601) and the reaction of the<br>
control column shows negative (step ST1608), the judgement of<br>
this test is decided to be provisionally negative (step<br>
ST1609), necessity of performing Du test is displayed (step<br>
ST1610) and the sequence shifts to step ST1607 where major<br>
causes of the fact that a weak reaction occurs are displayed.<br>
When the reaction of control column shows positive at the<br>
steps ST1603, ST1605 and ST1608, the judgement of the Rho (D)<br>
test is decided to be impossible (step ST1611) and major<br>
causes of the fact that a reaction of the control column<br>
(autologous control) shows positive are displayed (step<br>
ST1612).<br>
[0030]<br>
Fig. 17 is a flowchart showing the operations of the<br>
judgement of the Rh-hr test which is a test among the blood<br>
tests of the step ST906 of Fig. 9. When the reaction of the<br>
Rh-hr test column shows normal (step ST1701 ) and the reaction<br>
of the control column shows negative (step ST1702), the<br>
judgement of the Rh-hr test is decided to be definite (step<br>
ST1703) and Rh phenotype and blood type ratio appeared among<br>
Japanese are displayed (step ST1704). When the reaction of the<br>
Rh-hr /test column does not show normal and the reaction of the<br>
control column shows negative (step ST1705), the result of the<br>
Rh-hr test is decided to be provisional (step ST1706) and<br>
provisional Rh phenotype is displayed (step ST1707) with major<br>
causes of the fact that a weak reaction occurs (step ST1708).<br>
When the reaction of the control column shows positive at the<br>
steps ST1702 or ST1705, judgement of result of the Rh-hr test<br>
is decided to be impossible (steps ST1709 and ST1710) and<br>
major causes of the fact that reaction of the control column<br>
(autologous control) shows positive are displayed (step<br>
ST1711).<br>
[0031]<br>
Fig. 18 is a flowchart showing the operations of the<br>
judgement of the Direct Anti-globulin Test (DAT) which is a<br>
test among the blood tests of the step ST905 of Fig. 9. The<br>
direct anti-globulin test is a test for determining whether<br>
antigen-antibody reaction has occurred inside a patient's body<br>
or not. When the reaction of the column of the reagent<br>
cassette showt.i positive (step ST1801), the reaction of the<br>
control column is taken into consideration. When the reaction<br>
of the control column shows negative (step ST1802), the direct<br>
anti-globulin test is decided to be positive (step ST1803).<br>
Thereafter, a warning to carry out an elution test is<br>
displayed (step ST1804). When the test is to be terminated<br>
(step ST1805), the sequence shifts back to the main menu. When<br>
the test should continue, the sequence shifts to the step<br>
ST1801. When the reaction of the control column shows positive<br>
at the step ST1802, the judgement of the result of the test is<br>
suspended (step ST1806). Thereafter, at least one of a test<br>
using polyspecific coombs serum and a test using IgG coombs<br>
serum shows positive (step ST1807), the sequence shifts to<br>
step ST1804 and a warning to carry out an elution test is<br>
displayed. When both of the test using polyspecific coombs<br>
serum and the test using IgG coombs serum show negative, the<br>
sequence shifts to the step ST1805 where it is decided whether<br>
DAT should be terminated or not. On the other hand, when the<br>
reaction of the column of the reagent cassette shows negative<br>
at step ST1801, the reaction of the control column is taken<br>
inot consideration. When the reaction of the control column<br>
shows nagative (step ST1808), the direct anti-globulin test is<br>
decided to be negative (step ST1809) and the sequence shifts<br>
to the step ST1805. On the other hand, when the reaction of<br>
the control column shows positive at the step ST1808, the<br>
judgement of the result of the direct anti-globulin test is<br>
suspended (step ST1810), major causes of the fact that<br>
reaction of the control column shows positive are displayed<br>
(step ST1811) and the sequence shifts to the step ST1805.<br>
[0032]<br>
In order to determine whether the antigen-antibody<br>
reaction has occurred in the past or it is occurring now, a<br>
monospecific cassette and polyspecific cassette are used.<br>
Fig. 19 is a flowchart showing the operations of the<br>
judgement of the cross-matching test which is selected at the<br>
cross-matching and irregular antibody dialog window displayed<br>
at step ST911 of Fig. 9. The cross-matching test is a test for<br>
determining whether agglutination occurs or not by causing an<br>
antigen-antibody reaction in a cassette, which could occur<br>
inside a patient's body when blood for transfusion and<br>
patient's blood are mixed.<br>
[0034]<br>
At first, it is determined whether there is a control<br>
(autologous control) or not in this cross-matching test (step<br>
ST1901). This is previously set by the configuration of the<br>
program run at the facility station 200a. When there is an<br>
autologous control and a main test shows positive (step<br>
ST1902), the result of the autologous control is taken into<br>
consideration. When the result of the autologous control shows<br>
positive (step ST1903), causes of the fact that the result of<br>
the autologous control shows positive are displayed (step<br>
ST1904) and the sequence shifts back to the main menu. When<br>
the result of the autologous control shows negative at the<br>
step ST1903, the whole procedure is terminated directly and<br>
the sequence shifts back to the main menu. Further, the result<br>
of the main test shows negative and the result of the<br>
autologous control shows positive (step ST1905), the sequence<br>
shifts to the step ST1904 and causes of the fact that the<br>
result of the control shows positive are displayed. When the<br>
result of the control shows negative at the step ST1905, the<br>
sentence meaning that the accuracy of the cross-matching test<br>
is limited is displayed (step ST1906), a certificate of cross-<br>
matching test is printed out by the printer 202a of the<br>
facility station 200a (step ST1907), the whole procedure is<br>
terminated and the sequence shifts back to the main menu. On<br>
the other hand, when there is not an autologous control at<br>
step ST1901, if the result of the main test shows positive<br>
(step ST1908), the whole procedure is terminated, and if the<br>
result shows negative, the sequence shifts to step ST1906, the<br>
sentence meaning that the accuracy of the cross-matching test<br>
is limited is displayed and a certificate of the cross-<br>
matching test is printed out (step ST1907).<br>
[0035]<br>
Fig. 20 is a flowchart showing the operations of the<br>
judgement of the irregular antibody test which is selected at<br>
the cross-matching and irregular antibody dialog window<br>
displayed at step ST911 of Fig. 9. The irregular antibody test<br>
(screening) is a test for detecting antibodies included in the<br>
serum of the blood of a donor, a patient and a pregnant woman,<br>
in advance at a high sensitivity, which may cause transfusion<br>
side effects and neonate laky blood illness by using O type<br>
red blood cells whose antigen profile has already been known.<br>
Whether agglutination occurs or not is investigated using the<br>
reagent red blood cells and patient's serum. When<br>
agglutination occurs, identification of the antibody is<br>
At first, it is determined whether there is an autologous<br>
control or not in this irregular antibody test (step ST2001).<br>
This is previously set by the configuration - of the program run<br>
at the facility station 200a. When there is an autologous<br>
control and a main test shows positive (step ST2002), the<br>
result of the autologous control is taken into consideration.<br>
When the result of the autologous control shows positive (step<br>
ST2003), causes of the fact that the result of the autologous<br>
control shows positive are displayed (step ST2004).<br>
Thereafter, the instruction to carry out an elution<br>
identification test is displayed (step ST2005), the whole<br>
procedure is terminated and the sequence shifts back to the<br>
main menu. When the result of the autologous control shows<br>
negative at step ST2003, the instruction to carry out an<br>
antibody identification procedure is displayed (step ST2006)<br>
and the sequence shifts back to the main menu. Further, the<br>
result of the main test shows negative at step ST2002 and the<br>
result of the autologous control shows positive (step ST2007),<br>
the sequence shifts to the step ST2004 where causes of the<br>
fact that the result of the autologous control shows positive<br>
are displayed. When the result of the autologous control shows<br>
negative at step ST2007, a sentence meaning that there is a<br>
possibility of pseudo-positive is displayed (step ST2008), the<br>
V7hole procedure is terminated and the sequence shifts back to<br>
the mein menu. On the other hand, when there is not an<br>
autologous control at step ST2001 and the result of the main<br>
test shows positive (step ST2009), an instruction to carry out<br>
an antibody identification procedure is displayed (step<br>
ST2010), ..the whole procedure is terminated and the sequence<br>
shifts back to the main menu. When the result shows negative<br>
at step ST2009, the sequence shifts to step ST2008 where the<br>
possibility of pseudo-negative is displayed.<br>
[0037]<br>
