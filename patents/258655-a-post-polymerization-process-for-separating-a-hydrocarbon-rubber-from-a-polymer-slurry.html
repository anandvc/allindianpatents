				<td>PHASE SEPARATION PROCESS UTILIZING A HYDROFLUOROCARBON<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
[0001]	This disclosure relates to a hydrocarbon-rubber composition, and<br>
methods for separating diluent and unreacted monomers from a solution comprising a hydrocarbon-rubber dissolved in a hydrocarbon solvent. In particular, this disclosure relates to the use of a hydrofluorocarbon diluent as a phase separating agent to separate monomers such as C4-C7 isoolefins from mixtures such as butyl rubber dissolved in a C5-C10 hydrocarbon solvent. This disclosure also relates to methods for preparing a rubber cement from a solution comprising a hydrocarbon-rubber dissolved in a hydrocarbon solvent and a diluent by addition of a hydrofluorocarbon phase separating agent to produce a polymer rich rubber cement phase and a diluent rich phase.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002]	Isoolefin polymers, and in particular, hydrocarbon-rubbers, may be<br>
prepared in carbocationic polymerization processes. See, e.g.. Organic Chemistry,<br>
SIXTH EDITION, Morrison and Boyd, Prentice-Hall, 1084-1085, Englewood Cliffs,<br>
New Jersey 1992, and K. Matyjaszewski, ed. Cationic Polymerizations, Marcel<br>
Dekker, Inc., New York, 1996. The catalyst system for producing hydrocarbon-<br>
rubbers typically includes two components- an initiator and a Lewis acid.<br>
Examples of Lewis acids include AICI3 and BF3. Examples of initiators include<br>
Bronsted acids such as HC1, RCOOH (wherein R is an alkyl group), and PLO.<br>
During the polymerization process, in what is generally referred to as the initiation<br>
step, the isoolefin, e.g., isobutylene, reacts with the Lewis acid/initiator pair to<br>
produce a carbenium ion. Following the initiation step, additional monomer units<br>
add to the formed carbenium ion in what is generally referred to as the<br>
propagation step. These steps typically take place in a diluent or in a solvent.<br>
[0003]	Industry   has   generally   accepted  widespread   use   of a   slurry<br>
polymerization process to produce hydrocarbon-rubbers, using methyl chloride (MeCl)  as the  diluent.   Typically, the diluent  used  in slurry  polymerization<br>
processes consists essentially of methyl chloride. Methyl chloride is employed for a variety of reasons, including the ability of methyl chloride to dissolve the monomers and the aluminum) chloride catalyst of the reaction mixture, but not dissolve the hydrocarbon-rubber polymer product of the polymerization process. Methyl chloride also has a suitable freezing point to permit low temperature polymerization, typically at temperatures less than or equal to -90Â°C. Methyl chloride also has a suitably low, boiling point to allow for effective separation of the hydrocarbon-rubber polymer from the diluent. A slurry polymerization process using methyl chloride as the diluent also offers the advantage of a hydrocarbon-rubber polymer concentration of approximately 26% to 37% by volume in the reaction mixture, as opposed to a concentration of only about 8% to 12% in a solution polymerization process, wherein the hydrocarbon-rubber polymer is at least partially dissolved in a solvent. Reaction mixtures using methyl chloride as a diluent also have a relatively low viscosity, enabling the heat of polymerization formed during the polymerization reaction to be removed effectively by surface heat exchange.<br>
[0004]	Typical commercial reactors used to produce hydrocarbon-rubber<br>
in a slurry polymerization process include well mixed vessels with a volume of about 10 to 30 liters, wherein the circulation of the reaction mixture is often provided by a pump impeller. An example of such a reactor includes a continuous flow stirred tank reactor ("C.FSTR") as described in U.S. Patent No. 5,417,930, which is incorporated by reference herein. For purposes herein, a reactor suitable for use in a slurry polymerization process to produce rubber is referred to in general as a "reactor" or as a "butyl reactor". In these reactors, slurry is circulated through tubes of a heat exchanger by a pump, while boiling ethylene on the shell side provides cooling, the slurry temperature being determined by the boiling ethylene temperature, the required heat flux and the overall resistance to heat transfer. On the slurry side, the heat exchanger surfaces progressively accumulate polymer, inhibiting heat transfer, which would tend to cause the slurry temperature to rise. This often limits the practical slurry concentration that can be used in most reactors from 26 to 37 volume % relative to the total volume of the slurry, diluent, and unreacted monomers. The subject of polymer accumulation<br>
has been addressed in several patents (such as U.S. Patent No. 2,534,698, U.S. Patent No. 2,548,415, and U.S. Patent No. 2,644,809). However, these patents have unsatisfactorily addressed the myriad of problems associated with polymer particle agglomeration for , implementing a desired commercial process. Additionally, Thaler, W.A., Buckley, Sr., D.J., High Molecular-Weight, High Unsaturation Copolymers of Isobutylene and Conjugated Dienes, 49(4) Rubber Chemical Technology, 960 (1976), discloses, inter alia, the cationic slurry polymerization of copolymers of isobutylene with isoprene (butyl rubber) and with cyclopentadiene in heptane.<br>
[0005]	However, there are a number of problems associated with the<br>
polymerization in methyl chloride, for example, the tendency of the polymer particles in the reactor to agglomerate with each other and to collect on the reactor wall, heat transfer surfaces, impeller(s), and the agitator(s)/pump(s). The rate of agglomeration increases rapidly as reaction temperature rises. Agglomerated particles tend to adhere to and grow and plate-out on all surfaces they contact, such as reactor discharge lines, as well as any heat transfer equipment being used to remove the exothermic heat of polymerization, which is critical since low temperature reaction conditions must be maintained.<br>
[0006]	Other polymerization processes and/or downstream processing of<br>
polymers are carried out in a vehicle which is a solvent for both the monomers to be polymerized and the polymer formed. In such "solvent polymerization processes", the separation of the.polymer from the vehicle is generally an energy intensive step where the separation of the polymer from the solvent is carried out by steam stripping or other suitable solvent evaporation techniques. This is an energy intensive process. It has long been recognized that substantial economies in polymer processes could be achieved if the energy requirements of the solvent-polymer separation step could be minimized.<br>
[0007]	It is well known that many solvent-polymer solutions are stable<br>
over a limited temperature range and can be caused to separate into a solvent rich and polymer rich phase by heating or cooling. Upon heating, these solutions exhibit a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) above which separation of the polymer from the solvent system will occur. This separation results in the<br>
formation of two distinct phases, one a solvent rich phase, the other a polymer rich phase. These phase separation phenomena are generally pressure dependent, and the two phase systems can be made to revert to a homogeneous single phase by isothermally increasing the pressure of the system above a critical value which depends upon the composition of the solution and the molecular weight of the polymer. The LCST for polyisobutylene (PIB) was disclosed in Bardin, J.-M.; Patterson, D. Polymer 1969, 10, 247, the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
[0008]	The LCST is that temperature above which a solution will separate<br>
into two distinct phases, a solvent rich phase and a solute rich phase. The separation phenomenon can also occur at a second lower temperature termed the Upper Critical Solution Temperature (UCST). Below the UCST a two phase separation again occurs. The measurement of LCST and UCST end points are made at the vapor pressure of the solution. The prior art teaches a number of methods of utilizing the LCST as a means for causing a polymer solution to separate into a polymer rich phase and a solvent rich phase. Illustrative prior art processes which have utilized the LCST phenomenon in polymer separation processes include those described in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,553,156; 3,496,135; and 3,726,843. These prior art processes are disadvantageous in that a significant amount of heat energy is required to raise the temperature of the solution to affect the desired separation.<br>
[0009]	U.S. Pat. No. 4,319,021  is directed to an improvement in the<br>
foregoing phase separation prpcesses which permits the use of lower separation<br>
temperatures. The technique described in this patent includes the addition of a low<br>
molecular weight hydrocarbon to the polymer solution. Suitable low molecular<br>
weight hydrocarbons are the C2-C4 alkenes and alkanes, which are utilized at<br>
about 2 to about 20 weight percent (wt%). While this improved process<br>
substantially reduces the phase separation temperature, heating is still required in<br>
order to affect the desired separation. Separation processes utilizing the UCST are<br>
also disadvantageous because of the need to further cool the solutions.<br>
[0010}	U.S. Patent No. 4,946,940 is directed to a phase separation process<br>
wherein a temperature independent phase separation is reportedly caused to occur<br>
in a polymer solution by introducing into the polymer solution a critical amount of<br>
a phase separation agent. Below the critical concentration of the phase separation<br>
agent, the mixture exhibits a normal, lower critical solution temperature<br>
("LCST"). Compounds useful as phase, separation agents in the practice of this<br>
disclosure include CO2, C1-C4 alkanes, C2-C4 alkenes, C2-C4 alkynes, hydrogen,<br>
nitrogen and its various oxides, helium, neon, CO and mixtures thereof.<br>
[0011]	In such methods, a sufficient amount of a phase separation agent<br>
(PSA) is introduced into the polymer solution so that the solution, under appropriate pressures, can separate out a polymer rich phase at all temperatures between the LCST and the UCST (as determined using the pure polymer-solvent system, essentially free of the PSA.) The consequent phase separation results in a polymer rich phase and a solvent rich phase. Where methane is used as the PSA, under appropriate conditions for hydrocarbon polymers, the solvent rich phase comprises about 80% or more by volume of the total system and is substantially free of polymer.<br>
[0012]	There is need for a process technique which would allow for the<br>
economies of the afore described slurry preparation process along with the ease of separation and economies associated with phase separation of a solvent polymerization process to be carried out at or near the polymerization reaction exit temperature. In that way, little or no additional heat input would be required to affect the separation. Heretofore, such idealized, improved processes have not been achieved.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0033]	Various  specific  embodiments,  versions  and  examples  of the<br>
present disclosure will now be described, including preferred embodiments and definitions that are adopted herein for purposes of understanding the claimed invention. For determining infringement, the scope of the "invention" will refer to any one or more -of the appended claims, including equivalents thereof, and elements or limitations that are equivalent to those recited.<br>
[0034]	For purposes of this disclosure and the claims thereto, the terms<br>
"hydrocarbon-rubber polymer", "hydrocarbon-rubber composition",<br>
"hydrocarbon-rubber", and "rubber" are used interchangeably herein, and refer to<br>
elastomers or elastomenc compositions of polymers consistent with the ASTM<br>
Dl 566-06 definition. Examples of hydrocarbon-rubber comprise polymer(s)<br>
and/or co-polyrner(s) ol isobutylene, isoprene, para-methyl slyrene, or a<br>
combination thereof. In preferred embodiments, hydrocarbon-rubber polymers<br>
include poly isobutylene homopolymers, isobutylene-isoprene (butyl rubber)<br>
copolymers, isobutylene and para-methylstyrene copolymers, star-branched butyl<br>
rubber terpolymers, and the like. Further examples of hydrocarbon-rubber<br>
comprise halogenated polymer(s) and/or halogenated co-polymer(s) of<br>
isobutylene, isoprene, para-methyl styrene, or a combination thereof.<br>
[0035]	The term "catalyst system" refers to and includes any Lewis acid(s)<br>
or other metal complex(es) used to catalyze the polymerization of the olefinic monomers to produce hydrocarbon-rubber polymers, as well as at least one initiator, and optionally other catalyst component(s).<br>
[0036]	The phrase "suitable polymerization conditions" relates to the<br>
selection of polymerization conditions and components, well within the ability of<br>
those skilled in the art, which are necessary ,to obtain the production of a desired polymer in light of process parameters and component properties. There are numerous permutations of the slurry polymerization process to produce hydrocarbon-rubber polymers, as well as numerous variations in the polymerization components available to produce a hydrocarbon-rubber having one or more desired attributes.<br>
[0037]	The phrase "polymer slurry" refers to a reactor effluent comprising<br>
any gas, vapor, liquid, or combination thereof of the slurry after polymerization. The polymer slurry includes the hydrofluorocarbon diluent or mixture of diluents, solvents, the unreacted monomers, as well as other components in the feed or catalyst systems, and the hydrocarbon rubber polymer. Of course, the catalyst system or catalyst system components are present only to the extent they are present after polymerization. The polymer slurry may also refer to a hydrocarbon rubber polymer Jispeised within a hydrofluulocarbon diluent, whether or not the polymer slurry is a direct reaction product.<br>
[0038]	The phrases "rubber cement" and "hydrocarbon-rubber cement"<br>
are used interchangeable herein, refers to rmxture(s) made from rubber mixed in a solvent such as hexane, heptane or benzene. The mixture(s) further comprises diluent(s), catalyst, and/ir unreacted mononmr(s).<br>
[0039]	Diluent means a diluting or dissolving agent. Hydrofluorocarbon<br>
diluent is specifically defined to include particular hydrofluorocarbons that can act as solvents for the Lewis Acid, other metal complexes, initiators, monomers or other additives in a process to produce hydrocarbon-rubber, but in which the hydrocarbon-rubber produced is not readily soluble. In the practice of this disclosure, the diluent does not alter the general nature of the components of the polymerization medium, i.e., the components of the catalyst system, monomers, etc. However, it is recognized that interactions between the diluent and reactants may occur. In preferred embodiments, the diluent does not react with the catalyst system components, monomers, etc. to any appreciable extent. Additionally, and unless otherwise specified, the term diluent may include mixtures of at least two or more diluents.<br>
[0040]	The term "retrofit" as used herein means to provide (a process, a<br>
manufacture, a plant, or a factory, for example) with parts, devices, or equipment not in existence or available at the time of original manufacture and/or to install or fit (a process, a facility, or a reactor, for example) for use in or on an existing structure of an existing solution cationic polymerization plant or an existing slurry cationic polymerization plant.<br>
[0041]	Various other terms used herein include a reactor, which is defined<br>
as any container(s) in which a chemical reaction occurs. As used herein, the new numbering scheme for the Periodic Table Groups are used as in CHEMICAL AND ENGINEERING NEWS, 63(5), 27 (1985). Polymer may be used to refer to homopolymers, copolymers, interpolymers, terpolymers, etc. Likewise, a copolymer may refer to a polymer comprising at least two monomers, optionally with other monomers.<br>
[0042]	When a polymer is referred to as comprising a monomer, the<br>
monomer is present in the polymer in the polymerized form of the monomer or in the derivative form of the monomer. Likewise, when catalyst components are described as comprising neutral stable forms of the components, it is well understood by one skilled in the art, that the ionic form of the component is the form that reacts with the monomers to produce polymers.<br>
[0043]	Allcyl refers to a paraffinic hydrocarbon group having from 2 to 20<br>
carbon atoms, which may be derived from the corresponding alkane by dropping one or more hydrogens from the formula, such as, for example, a methyl group (CH3) which is derived from methane (CH4), or an ethyl group (CH3CH2) which is derived from ethane (CH3CH3), and the like.<br>
[0044]	Aryl refers to a hydrocarbon group comprising 5 to 20 carbon<br>
atoms, that forms a conjugated ring structure characteristic of aromatic compounds such as, for example, benzene, naphthalene, phenanthrene, anthracene, and the like, which possess alternating double bonding ("unsaturation") within its structure. An aryl group is thus a group derived from an aromatic compound by dropping one or more hydrogens from the formula such as, for example, phenyl, or C6H5.,<br>
[0045]	The term "substituted functional group(s)" refers to replacement of<br>
at least one hydrogen atom on the functional group (e.g., alkyl, alkene, alkyne, aryl) by at least one substituent selected from, for example, halogen (chlorine, bromine, fluorine, or iodine), amino, nitro, sulfoxy (sulfonate or alkyl sulfonate), thiol, alkylthiol, and hydroxy 1; alkyl, straight or branched chain having 1 to 20 carbon atoms which includes methyl, ethyl, propyl, tert-butyl, isopropyl, isobutyl, etc.; alkoxy, straight or branched chain alkoxy having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, and includes, for example, methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, isopropoxy, butoxy, isobutoxy, secondary butoxy, tertiary butoxy, pentyloxy, isopentyloxy, hexyloxy, heptryloxy, octyloxy, nonyloxy, and decyloxy; haloalkyl, which means straight or branched chain alkyl having 1 to 20 carbon atoms which is substituted by at least one halogen.<br>
[0046]	The term "essentially homogeneous liquid phase" refers to a liquid<br>
phase wherein at least 99 wt% of the material is in a single liquid phase Accordingly, an essentially homogeneous liquid phase need not comprise a single phase, but may include less than 1 wt% of solids including various components, which are not fully dissolved in the liquid phase.

[0063]	The   temperature   at   which   the   hydrocarbon-rubber   slurry   is<br>
produced may be less than -20Â°C, preferably less than -40Â°C, with less than -50Â°C being more preferred.<br>
[0064]	The  order  of contacting  the   monomer  feed-stream,   catalyst,<br>
initiator, and diluent may vary from one embodiment to another. For a more information regarding polymerization processes, see, for example, International Application Nos. PCT/US03/40903 and PCT/US03/40340. Selection of the Hydrofluorocarbon Diluent<br>
[0065]	Hydrofluorocarbons are preferably used as diluents in the present<br>
disclosure, alone or in combination with other hydrofluorocarbons or in<br>
combination with other solvents, diluents, and the like. For purposes of this<br>
disqlosure and,.the claims thereto, hydrofluorocarbons ("HFC's" or "HFC") are<br>
defined to be saturated or unsaturated compounds consisting essentially of<br>
hydrogen, carbon and fluorine, provided the HFC comprises at least one carbon<br>
atom, at least one hydrogen atom and at least one fluorine atom.<br>
[0066]	The method of the instant invention relies on the discovery that the<br>
amount of the HFC diluent that leads to liquid-liquid phase separation of a solution comprised of a hydrocarbon-rubber, a hydrocarbon solvent and an HFC<br><br>
diluent is significantly less than that required for chlorinated hydrocarbon diluents such as methyl chloride. Suitable HFC diluents of the present disclosure may be characterized as phase separating agents when put in contact with a solution of a hydrocarbon rubber dissolved in a hydrocarbon solvent. In addition, the catalyst and monomers utilized in formation of the hydrocarbon-rubber polymer are preferably soluble in the HFC diluent, while the hydrocarbon-rubber is preferably essentially insoluble in the HFC diluent.<br>
[0067]	Preferably the HFC diluent is a gas at 25Â°C and 101.3 kPa-a of<br>
pressure. Below a particular pressure, unique to each diluent -polymer-solvent system, the system can be caused to separate into distinct phases. Isothermal increases in pressure reverse the phenomenon and result in a homogeneous system.<br>
[0068]	The HFC diluent of the present disclosure is thus selected such that<br>
upon contact of the hydrocarbon-rubber slurry with the hydrocarbon solvent, separation of the phases occurs over a temperature range that encompasses the UCST and LCST, as determined for a solvent-polymer system, free of monomers, the HFC diluent, and other extraneous compounds.<br>
[0069]	In certain embodiments, the diluent comprises hydrofluorocarbons<br>
represented by the formula: CxHyFz wherein x is an integer from 1 to 1O, alternatively from 1 to 9, alternatively from 1 to 8, alternatively from 1 to 7, alternatively from, 1 to 6, alternatively from 1 to 5, alternatively from 1 to 4, alternatively from 1 to 3, most preferably 2 carbon atoms, wherein y is at least 1 and z is at least 1.<br>

and mixtures thereof and including mixtures of saturated HFC's described above.<br>
[0072]	The diluent may also comprise a blend comprising one or more of<br>
the above HFC diluents in combination with one or more substituted or unsubstituted alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, or a combination thereof, each comprising from 1 to 10 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to 5 carbon atoms, with 1 to 3 carbon atoms being most preferred.<br>
[0073]	In an embodiment, the diluent may comprise a blend with methyl<br>
chloride wherein such blend comprises 5 to 90 weight percent of methyl chloride based on the combined weight of the methyl chloride and the HFC present in the mixture, alternatively between 5 and 80 weight %, alternatively between 5 and 70 weight % , alternatively between 5 and 60 weight %, alternatively between 5 and 50 weight percent, alternatively between 5 and 40 weight percent, alternatively between 5 and 30 weight percent, alternatively between 5 and 20 weight% and alternatively between 5 and 10 weight %.<br>
[0074]  . , In another embodiment, the polymer slurry of the present<br>
disclosure is preferably essentially free of methyl chloride, wherein essentially<br>
free is defined as wherein methyl chloride is not intentionally added to the<br>
polymer slurry, however, methyl chloride may exist as a trace impurity, for<br>
example, less than 1 wt%, preferably less than 0.5 wt%, more preferably with less<br>
than 0.05 wt% in various solvents, Feactants, and other components of the system.<br>
[0075]	In another embodiment the HFC's are used in combination with<br>
one or more gases inert to the polymerisation such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen, hydrogen, argon, neon, helium, krypton, xenon, and/or other inert gases. Preferred<br>
gases include carbon dioxide and/or nitrogen. Preferably, inert gases are in predominate liquid phase at entry to the reactor.<br>
[0076]	The HFC diluent is typically present at 1 to 100 volume % based<br>
upon the total volume of the diluents in the hydrocarbon-rubber slurry,<br>
alternatively between 5 and 100 volume %, alternatively between 10 and 100<br>
volume %, alternatively between 15 and 100 volume %, alternatively between 20<br>
and 100 volume %, alternatively between 25 and 100 volume %, alternatively<br>
between 30 and 100 volume %, alternatively between 35 and 100 volume %,<br>
alternatively between 40 and 100 volume %, alternatively between 45 and 100<br>
volume %, alternatively betwe'en'50 and 100 volume %, alternatively between 55<br>
and 100 volume %, alternatively between 60 and 100 volume %, alternatively<br>
between 65 and 100 volume %, alternatively between 70 and 100 volume %,<br>
alternatively between 75 and 100 volume %, alternatively between 80 and 100<br>
volume %, alternatively between 85 and 100 volume %, alternatively between 90<br>
and 100 volume %, alternatively between 95 and 100 volume %, alternatively<br>
between 97 and 100 volume %, alternatively between 98 and 100 volume %, and<br>
alternatively between 99 and 100 volume %. In a preferred embodiment the HFC<br>
diluent is selected from the group consisting of 1,1-difluoroethane, 1,1,1-<br>
trifluoroethane, and 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane and mixtures thereof.<br>
[0077]	While the method of this disclosure will generally be carried out at<br>
a pressure which is at or above the pressure at which the HFC diluent separates from the HFC diluent-polymer-solvent combination, known in the art as the bubble point line, it may also be advantageously carried out at lower pressures when a relatively small vapor phase comprising the HFC diluent can be present. For â  separation to occur, the pressure will be at ranges where either the liquid/liquid or liquid/liquid/ vapor phases are formed. As used in the specification and claims, the term "bubble point pressure" means the vapor pressure of the HFC-Polymer-solvent system at1 a particular temperature. The "bubble point line" may be represented by a plot of pressure vs. temperature, which is the locus of the bubble point pressures for such a system.<br>
[0078]	The amount of HFC diluent required to achieve phase separation<br>
upon combination of the hydrocarbon-rubber slurry with the hydrocarbon solvent<br>
is a function of the solvent, the type of hydrocarbon rubber polymer present (e.g., the polymer molecular weight, molecular weight distribution, the rubber composition, and the composition and purity of the HFC diluent. Accordingly, no specific value exists for all situations. However, the hydrofluorocarbon diluent is preferably present in the hydrocarbon-rubber slurry such that upon combination with a hydrocarbon solvent, the HFC diluent preferably accounts for at least 10 wt% of the total amount of materials present in the combination of the hydrocarbon-rubber slurry with the hydrocarbon solvent. In an embodiment, the HFC preferably accounts for at least 15 wt%, preferably at least 20 wt%, preferably at least 25 wt%, preferably at least 30 wt%, preferably at least 35 wt%, preferably at least 40 wt%, preferably at least 45 wt%, preferably at least 50 wt%, of the total amount of materials present in the combination of the hydrocarbon-rubber slurry with the hydrocarbon,solvent.<br>
[0079]	The required amount of the HFC diluent may also be determined<br>
relative to a preferred amount of hydrocarbon solvent present as required for a<br>
given amount of hydrocarbon-rubber. In making such a determination,<br>
compositions of polymer solution (the hydrocarbon-rubber dissolved in the<br>
hydrocarbon solvent) and the HFC diluent are prepared and the temperatures and<br>
pressures at which phase separation occurs are measured. These techniques are<br>
well known in the art and readily accomplished by the experienced practitioner.<br>
For example, a small amount of HFC diluent is dissolved in a polymer solution of<br>
given composition. The solution is cooled until turbidity first appears. This<br>
temperature is the UCST for the prepared composition. The solution may then be<br>
heated until turbidity appears. This temperature is the LCST. These measurements<br>
are repeated with increasing concentrations of the HFC diluent to produce a phase<br>
diagram which indicates increasing UCST and decreasing LCST as the<br>
concentration of HFC diluent increases. At or above the critical concentration, the<br>
USCT and LCST are equal and phase separation occurs at all temperatures<br>
provided the pressure is below me critical pressure of tne system.<br>
[0080]	The minimum critical concentration is obtained by plotting UCST<br>
and LCST versus HFC-diluent concentration. The point of coincidence of the UCST and LCST in such a plot defines the minimum critical concentration.<br>
[0081]	While polymer separation processes are generally considered in the<br>
context of solution and/or slurry polymerization processes, it is often necessary to affect such separations in processes other than polymerization processes. For example, butyl rubber is halogenated by first dissolving the finished polymer in hexane, halogenating the polymer and subsequently recovering the polymer. The separation process of this disclosure is equally applicable to such a separation. Solvents<br>
[0082]	The  hydrocarbon  solvent  may  comprise  C1-C10  hydrocarbons.<br>
Hydrocarbon solvents of the present disclosure are preferably selected such that the intended amount of hydrocarbon rubber present in the hydrocarbon-rubber slurry is soluble in the amount of solvent present at the temperatures at which the slurry is contacted with the solvent ;111ustrativa non-limiting examples of the hydrocarbon solvents which can be used in the practice of this disclosure include linear, branched or cyclic C5 -C8 hydrocarbons. They include the isomers of pentane, hexane, heptane, octane, benzene, toluene, xylene, cyclohexane or mixtures thereof.<br>

Ultra Low Benzene type hexane (ULB hexane), which is a preferred grade of hexane consists essentially of a mixture of C6 isomers, namely n-hexane,      2-methylpentane,     3-methylpentane,     methylcyclopentane,     and<br>
cyclohexane. The exact balance of these isomers in ULB hexane varies from refinery to refinery. Separation Process<br>
[0084]	In   an  embodiment  of the   present  disclosure,   a  process   for<br>

comprises less than 80 wt%, preferably less than 70 wt%, preferably less than 60 wt%, preferably less than 50 wt%, preferably less than 40 wt%, preferably less than 30 wt%, preferably less than 20 wt%, preferably less than 15 wt%, preferably less than 10 wt%, preferably less than 5 wt.%, preferably less than 1 wt.% of the hydrofluorocarbon diluent present (based on the total weight of the hydrofluorocarbon diluent present in the polymer slurry). Most preferably, the second essentially homogeneous liquid phase comprises essentially all of the hydrocarbon-rubber present,-,essentially all of the hydrocarbon solvent present,<br>
and   essentially   none   of  the   unreacted   monomers,   the   catalyst,   and   the<br>
hydrofluorocarbon diluent present in the system.<br>
[0092]	Depending on the temperature and the pressure, a vapor phase may<br>
also be formed comprising or consisting essentially of the hydrofluorocarbon<br>
diluent.<br>
[0093]	The process  of this disclosure  may  also  include  the  step  of<br>
removing at least a portion of the hydrocarbon solvent from the second essentially<br>
homogeneous liquid phase to produce a hydrocarbon-rubber cement, or to remove<br>
essentially all of the hydrocarbon solvent to isolate the hydrocarbon-rubber.<br>
[0094]	The process of this disclosure may further comprise a step of<br>
adjusting the temperature, the pressure, and/or the weight fraction of the diluent in<br>
the resulting mixture to introduce phase-separation of the resulting mixture to<br>
produce a first essentially homogeneous liquid phase and a second essentially<br>
homogeneous liquid phase. The temperature may be adjusted from about -100 to<br>
about 160Â°C.<br>
[0095]	The process of this disclosure can be carried out in either a batch or<br>
continuous manner; however, a continuous process is generally preferred for<br>
economic reasons. The preferred procedure in obtaining polymer separation by<br>
utilizing this disclosure is as follows:<br>
1.	The hydrocarbon-rubber polymer slurry in an HFC diluent is contacted with a hydrocarbon solvent to dissolve the polymer at a minimum pressure of at least the vapor pressure of the resulting solution. Agitation may be desirable to obtain rapid dissolution. Turbulence in a flowing stream can provide the necessary agitation. The polymer slurry may be contacted with the hydrocarbon solvent at a pressure high enough to maintain the system as a one phase system.<br>
2.	Phase separation is allowed to occur. Where elevated pressures are used to maintain a single phase, it is necessary to reduce the pressure in order to achieve the two phase condition. The polymer phase may then be recovered by decanting, by gravity settling, by liquid/liquid centrifugation, or other suitable means.<br>
3.	The pressure may then be reduced on the light, solvent rich phase<br>
to vaporize the HFC diluent and residual monomers contained therein. Heating or cooling of the solvent rich phase to assist in the recovery of the particular HFC diluent, unreacted monomers, catalyst, and the like may also be desirable. The recovered HFC diluent and solvent, after purification, if needed, can now be reused in step 1.<br>
[0096]	The advantages of this disclosure may be more readily appreciated<br>
with reference to the following examples.<br>

[0100]	This disclosure described herein may be used in the manufacture<br>
polymers useful in wide variety of applications. The low degree of permeability to gases accounts for the largest uses of these polymers, namely inner tubes and tire innerliners. These same properties are also of importance in air cushions, pneumatic springs, air bellows, accumulator bags, and pharmaceutical closures. The thermal stability of the polymers of this disclosure make them ideal for rubber<br>
tire-curing bladders, high temperature service hoses, and conveyor belts for hot<br>
material handling.<br>
[0101]	The polymers exhibit high damping and have uniquely broad<br>
damping and shock absorption ranges in both temperature and frequency. They<br>
are useful in molded rubber parts and find wide applications in, automobile<br>
suspension bumpers, auto exhaust hangers, and body mounts.<br>
[0102]	The polymers of the instant invention are also useful in tire<br>
sidewalls and tread compounds. In sidewalls, the polymer characteristics impart<br>
good ozone resistance, crack cut growth, and appearance. The polymers of this<br>
disclosure may also be blended. Properly formulated blends with high diene<br>
rubbers that exhibit phase co-continuity yield excellent sidewalls. Improvements<br>
in wet, snow, and ice skid resistances and in dry traction without compromises in<br>
abrasion resistance and rolling resistance for high performance tires can be<br>
accomplished by using the polymers of the instant invention.<br>
[0103]	Blends of the polymers of this disclosure with thermoplastic resins<br>
are used for toughening of these compounds. High-density polyethylene and<br>
isotactic polypropylene are often modified with 5 to 30 wt % of polyisobutylene.<br>
In certain applications, the instant polymers provide for a highly elastic compound<br>
that is processable in thermoplastic molding equipment. The polymers of the<br>
instant invention may also be blended with polyamides to produce other industrial<br>
applications.<br>
[0104]	The  polymers  of the  instant  invention may  also  be  used  as<br>
adhesives, caulks, sealants, and glazing compounds. They are also useful as<br>
plasticizers in rubber formulations with butyl, SBR, and natural rubber. In linear<br>
low density polyethylene (LLDPE) blends, they induce cling to stretch-wrap<br>
films. They are also widely employed in lubricants as dispersants and in potting<br>
and electrical cable filling materials.<br>
[0105]	In certain applications, the polymers of this disclosure make them<br>
also  useful  in  chewing-gum,  as  well  as  in  medical  applications  such  as<br>
pharmaceutical stoppers, and the arts for paint rollers.<br>

[0108]	In the current invention, the phase- behavior of butyl rubber<br>
cements were determined on polymer solutions prepared from solvent mixtures of<br>
ULB hexane (ultra-low-benzene hexanes, obtained from ExxonMobil Chemical<br>
Co.) and comparative methyl chloride (obtained from Air Products) or  1,1-<br>
difluoroethane (152a, Technical Propellants) or 1,1,1,2-tetrafluroethane (134a, obtained from National Refrigerants or DuPont). Methyl chloride, 152a and 134a are generically referred to as the phase separating agent (PSA) or the diluent in the description for the purposes of teaching the method by which example data was collected. The experimental errors for all the experimental data collected were within Â±2.5% of the experimental data.<br>
[0109]	The, buty! rubber used for all experiments was a commercially<br>
available 268 grade or a 2222 grade from ExxonMobil Chemical Co. The 268 rubber was prepared for the measurements by dissolving it into hexane and filtering the resulting soiutiou to remove insoluble additives. 0.2 wt.% of BHT was added to this solution as a stabilizer for the experiments described below. The hexane was removed by evaporatipn. The polymer was finally dried in a vacuum oven at 45Â°C. The 268 rubber so prepared was then dissolved in a sufficient amount of ULB hexane to reach the predetermined concentration for individual experiments.<br>
[0110]	Alternatively, the 2222 grade of butyl was obtained and used as a<br>
solution or cement in ULB hexane at a concentration of 23 to 29 wt%. The actual concentration was predetermined for individual experiments. The cement was used as received.<br>
[0111]	Two different types of experiments were run which differed in the<br>
equipment used, the method of sample preparation and the handling of the solutions in order to make phase behavior observations. In the first set of experiments, a known amount of 268 butyl rubber was added to a 20 ml scintillation vial. To this vial was added a volume of ULB hexane specified by the desired final composition. The rubber was completely dissolved in this solvent. The solution was transferred into a dry box and subsequently cooled to a temperature below the boiling point of the phase separating agent (or diluent). At this lower temperature, the required amount of diluent was added as a liquid. The sealed vial was sealed, warmed to room temperature and then mixed completely. The sample was equilibrated at the desired final temperature for at least 2 hours before an observation was made. For the purposes of clarity, this procedure is described in detail for one example composition.<br>
[0112]	To a 20 ml scintillation vial was added 1.50 grams of butyl rubber<br>
followed by 10.0 ml of ULB hexane. The polymer was allowed to completely dissolve before completing the next steps. The polymer solution was then transferred into the dry box and the solution subsequently cooled to -60Â°C whereupon 1.30 ml of liquid 134a was added to the vial. The container was sealed and warmed to room temperature. The contents were mixed by occasionally shaking the vial over the next 2 hours. At that time, the phase behavior was determined (one o-r two phases). The volumes of the two phases were determined by marking the height of the two phases on the side of the vial. Once the contents of the vial were emptied, water was added to the appropriate mark and the volume of water measured by pouring'it mtd a graduated cylinder/<br>
[0113]	The compositions were recorded graphically on a ternary phase<br>
diagram with compositions observed to be one phase plotted as closed circles (â¢) and compositions observed to be two phases plotted as closed squares (â ). Diagrams were constructed for measurements at 25Â°C and -15Â°C using 134a as the HFC diluent. These plots are shown in Figures 1 and 2.<br>
[0114] The second set of experiments were conducted in a 400 ml Parr vessel equipped with two opposing glass windows in the cylindrical vessel's body. In these experiments, the rubber was dissolved at room temperature into an appropriate amount of ULB hexane to prepare solution with an initial rubber concentration of 25 to 36 wt.%. The initial concentration was chosen such that the final rubber concentration in the solution would be between 16 and 24 wt.% after adding diluent for each composition in the series, consistent with commercial practices in the art. The vessel was assembled for the experiment by first loading the rubber and the ULB hexanc. The vessel was sealed and the contents stirred until all the rubber was dissolved. The listed diluent was then loaded into the vessel from a sample cylinder containing the required amount of diluent under pressure at room temperature. The sample cylinder was originally loaded by adding a known amount of liquid diluent at a temperature below the boiling point of the diluent. The sample cylinder was sealed and warmed to room temperature. The mass of diluent transferred into the Parr vessel was determined by weighing the cylinder before and after the transfer. The Parr vessel was then heated with<br>
stirring until the solution turned cloudy. The LCST and the UCST were each determined by thermally equilibrating around the cloud point until the LCST (or the UCST) could be determined to within 2Â°C. In Figure 3, the entire phase curve from the UCST to the LCST are determined using MeCl (CH3C1), 134a (1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane) and a 1:1 blend of MeCl and 152a (1,1-difluoroethane). The data are listed in Table 2.<br><br>
