The present application claims priority of the Chinese patent application No. 20061014665.9,<br>
entitled "Method and System for Transmitting DHCP Message via PPP Link and Obtaining<br>
Configuration Information", and filed with the Chinese Patent Office on November 13, 2006, the<br>
whole contents of which are incorporated in the present application by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the field of communications, and more particularly to a<br>
communication technology based on point-to-point protocols.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
3G is the abbreviation for the 3rd Generation, indicating mobile communication technology<br>
of the third generation. In comparison with analog mobile communication technology of the first<br>
generation, digital mobile communication technologies such as Global System for Mobile<br>
Communications (GSM) and Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) of the second generation, 3G<br>
generally means the new generation mobile communications system that combines wireless<br>
communication with such multimedia communications as the Internet. It is possible through 3G to<br>
process a plurality of media forms such as images, music, and video streams, and provide a plurality<br>
of information services including webpage browsing, teleconference, and electronic business.<br>
The network side in a 3G system includes a base station controller and base stations. Each<br>
base station receives user device signals within its range of management, and sends the processed<br>
signals collectively to the base station controller via a transmission pathway. The base station<br>
controller centrally processes the information sent from the base stations, and transmits the processed<br>
information to the user devices through the base stations.<br>
To reduce cost of the base station controller during deployment of the network, it usually<br>
requires a base station controller to provide large-area coverage. The base station controller connects<br>
and controls multiple base stations, the base stations connected thereto may be as far as hundreds of<br><br>
kilometers away from the base station controller, and the base stations themselves may be distanced<br>
relatively far from one another.<br>
In view of these requirements, it is necessary to establish a maintenance channel through<br>
which base stations are remotely accessed and maintained in an efficient and convenient manner.<br>
Protocol of the maintenance channel is referred to as Transmission Control Protocol/Internet<br>
Protocol (TCP/IP).<br>
The maintenance channel of an IP Radio Access Network (RAN) is as shown in Fig. 1. To<br>
ensure the logic separation of functions of the devices, the base station provides an access IP, namely<br>
IP employed in specific services, and maintenance IP. The main purpose for establishing a<br>
maintenance channel lies in the necessity to acquire the address and relevant configuration of the<br>
maintenance IP.<br>
The following is a brief introduction to Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP),<br>
Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP), Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), and Point-to-Point<br>
Protocol (PPP).<br>
RARP stands for the Reverse Address Resolution Protocol that obtains the IP address through<br>
Medium Access Control (MAC) address; it is an early mode for automatically obtaining IP addresses<br>
and has been subsequently replaced by BOOTP or DHCP.<br>
BOOTP is a relatively old system boot protocol mainly used to obtain IP addresses and<br>
initiation filenames from a server during booting up of a diskless workstation.<br>
DHCP stands for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol that is an evolution of BOOTP and<br>
extends BOOTP from two aspects: one aspect is to enable a computer to obtain all configuration<br>
information it requires in one message, namely a protocol that transmits configuration information;<br>
and the other aspect is to allow the computer to quickly and dynamically obtain IP addresses, namely<br>
a mechanism for dynamically assigning IP addresses.<br>
PPP is a commonly employed IP link layer protocol, especially in the case transmission<br>
bearing is El. The negotiation process of PPP is divided into Link Control Protocol (LCP)<br><br>
negotiation and Network Control Port (NCP) negotiation, of which NCP is Internet Protocol Control<br>
Protocol (IPCP) negotiation with regard to the IP protocol, and it is possible for this negotiation<br>
process to assign IP addresses of PPP.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Various embodiments of the present invention are directed to providing a method and a<br>
system for transmitting DHCP message via a PPP link and obtaining configuration information.<br>
Accordingly, an embodiment of the present invention provides a method for transmitting a<br>
dynamic host configuration protocol DHCP message via a point-to-point protocol PPP link. The<br>
method includes: transmitting, by an end of the PPP link, a DHCP message to be broadcast to a peer<br>
end via the PPP link upon the receipt of the DHCP message to be broadcast; and filling an identifier<br>
capable of being used for uniquely identifying the device using the PPP link, as a hardware address in<br>
the DHCP message transmitted via the PPP link, when it is necessary to fill the hardware address in<br>
the DHCP message transmitted via the PPP link.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention provides a method for obtaining configuration<br>
information. The method includes: requesting, by a subordinate device, a superior device for<br>
configuration information via a DHCP message on a PPP link between the subordinate device and<br>
the superior device; setting, by the superior device which uses the PPP link, an identifier capable of<br>
being used for uniquely identifying the subordinate device in the DHCP message; and transmitting in<br>
accordance with the identifier capable of being used for uniquely identifying the subordinate device<br>
which uses the PPP link, by the superior device, the requested configuration information to the<br>
subordinate device via another DHCP message on the PPP link between the superior device and the<br>
subordinate device.<br>
Still another embodiment of the present invention provides a method for obtaining<br>
configuration information, comprising: carrying, by a superior device, configuration information in<br>
at least one predetermined negotiation parameter of Internet Control Protocol (IPCP) message when<br>
the superior device and a subordinate device connected thereto via a serial link perform IPCP layer<br>
negotiation; and transmitting, by the superior device, the configuration information to the<br>
subordinate device.<br><br>
Another embodiment of the present invention provides a system for obtaining configuration<br>
information. The system includes a superior device and a subordinate device connected to each other<br>
via a PPP link.<br>
The subordinate device includes a module adapted to request the superior device for<br>
configuration information on the PPP link via a DHCP message.<br>
The superior device includes a module adapted to transmit to the subordinate device<br>
configuration information on the PPP link via a DHCP message.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention includes a system for obtaining configuration<br>
information. The system includes: a superior device and a subordinate device connected to each<br>
other by a serial link.<br>
The superior device includes a module adapted to carry configuration information in at least<br>
one predetermined negotiation parameter of an IPCP message, and transmit the configuration<br>
information to the subordinate device via a PPP link established between the superior device and the<br>
subordinate device based on IPCP layer negotiation.<br>
The subordinate device includes a module adapted to receive the IPCP message via the PPP<br>
link between the superior device and the subordinate device, and obtain configuration information<br>
from at least one predetermined negotiation parameter of the IPCP message.<br>
As can be seen from the technical solutions of the embodiments according to the present<br>
invention, the end of the PPP link replaces the hardware address required in the DHCP message with<br>
an identifier capable of being used for uniquely identifying the device that uses the PPP link to<br>
satisfy the requirements of DHCP on broadcasting and hardware address, so as to make it possible to<br>
support DHCP on the PPP link and transmit DHCP broadcasting message directly via the PPP link.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS<br>
To make more apparent the inventive objectives, technical solutions and advantages of the<br>
present invention, the present invention is described in greater detail below with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>
Some solutions related to the present invention are firstly presented as follows.<br>
Solution 1:<br>
The base station makes use of the NCP protocol of the PPP link to negotiate and obtain the<br>
network layer address.<br>
As the inventors of the present invention have found, the addresses obtainable by using NCP<br>
in such a solution are limited, as it is only possible to obtain the addresses of the home end and the<br>
party end, while it is impossible to obtain other device parameters such as the IP address of the<br>
maintenance channel, the internal maintenance network segment of the device, and channel<br>
parameters, etc., and static configuration is required for those parameters. If static configuration is<br>
performed, manual labor is needed to maintain at the remote device, thus greatly increasing<br>
operational amount. In addition, there is only one address obtainable by using NCP, and access<br><br>
address and maintenance address of the device cannot be set as different values.<br>
Solution 2:<br>
The base station makes use of ordinary DHCP to obtain information of the maintenance<br>
channel.<br>
As the inventors found in such a solution, DHCP can currently merely support automatic<br>
configuration on an Ethernet medium, while it cannot support acquisition of configuration<br>
information on serial links such as PPP, and can hence not be applied in links such as El/Tl. This is<br>
so because DHCP requires broadcasting function, while PPP does not support the broadcasting<br>
function. Moreover, it is necessary to fill hardware address of the device, such as Medium Access<br>
Control (abbreviated as "MAC") address, in a part of DHCP messages, while PPP does not contain<br>
hardware address. But El/Tl are very common transmission approaches in 3G RAN, and the above<br>
defect therefore leads to restrictions in use of DHCP in RAN.<br>
As should be explained, the PPP link as referred to in the embodiment of the present<br>
invention is a generic concept including various links employing protocols in the PPP protocol<br>
family, such as the Multi Link Point to Point Protocol (MLPPP) link and Point to Point Protocol over<br>
Ethernet (PPPoE).<br>
An embodiment of the present invention relates to a technical solution of transmitting a<br>
DHCP message on a PPP link, as well as a technical solution of obtaining configuration information<br>
of a device on the PPP link via the DHCP message.<br>
Structure of the system for obtaining configuration information is as shown in Fig. 2,<br>
including a superior device and a subordinate device connected via the PPP link to each other.<br>
The subordinate device includes a module adapted to request the superior device for<br>
configuration information on the PPP link via the DHCP message, and the superior device includes a<br>
module adapted to transmit the configuration information to the subordinate device on the PPP link<br>
via the DHCP message. The PPP link between the superior and subordinate devices may be<br>
established on any serial line, including, but not limited to, RS232 serial port, El, Tl, Jl, E3, T3, etc.<br><br>
The process that the subordinate device obtains configuration information from the superior<br>
device is as shown in Fig. 3.<br>
A PPP link is established between the superior and subordinate devices in Block 301.<br>
Specifically, the PPP link may be provided on the subordinate device by default, so that the<br>
subordinate device can automatically request for PPP connection on such serial lines as El.<br>
In response to the request for PPP connection on such a serial line as El, the superior device<br>
assigns such information as interface and IP address to the subordinate device by means of the<br>
standard NCP protocol of PPP.<br>
The PPP link is established between the superior and subordinate devices through the above<br>
process. This process may be omitted if there has already been a PPP link between the superior<br>
device and subordinate device.<br>
When the PPP link is successfully established between the subordinate device and the<br>
superior device, the procedure goes to Block 320, in which the subordinate device requests the<br>
superior device for configuration information on the PPP link via the DHCP message.<br>
Subsequently the procedure goes to Block 330, in which the superior device transmits the<br>
configuration information to the subordinate device on the PPP link through the DHCP message.<br>
Both Block 320 and Block 330 involve transmitting the DHCP message on PPP. The existing<br>
DHCP can generally be supported by the Ethernet link only. DHCP cannot be supported on the PPP<br>
link mainly because of the following two aspects: 1) DHCP needs broadcast, whereas there is no<br>
broadcasting function on the PPP link; 2) DHCP requires hardware address, and the hardware<br>
address in the Ethernet link is the MAC address, whereas there is no MAC address in the PPP link.<br>
Accordingly, when the DHCP message is transmitted on the PPP link, it is necessary to extend DHCP<br>
to certain extent. Frame structure of a prior art DHCP is as shown in Table 1.<br><br><br>
The embodiment of the present invention solves the problem concerning support of DHCP by<br>
PPP with the following method.<br>
When an end of the PPP link receives a DHCP message to be broadcast, it transmits the<br>
DHCP message to a peer end via the PPP link.<br>
When it is necessary for the hardware address (chaddr) to be filled in the DHCP message<br>
transmitted via the PPP link, an identifier capable of being used for uniquely identifying the device,<br>
which uses the PPP link, is filled in the DHCP message as the hardware address.<br>
When the DHCP server assigns IP address to the device, the identifier capable of being used<br>
for uniquely identifying the device in the DHCP message is bound with the IP address assigned to the<br>
device.<br>
The identifier capable of being used for uniquely identifying the PPP link includes one of the<br>
following:<br>
a marker preset in the device, which can be set by other protocols and is preferably unique in<br><br>
a link number of the PPP link of superior device, suitable for the case in which there is only<br>
one DHCP client device on each PPP link; and<br>
a physical port serial number of the PPP link.<br>
When the identifier capable of being used for uniquely identifying the device that uses the<br>
PPP link is filled as the hardware address in the DHCP message, it can be filled by the device located<br>
at a side of the PPP link transmitting the DHCP message, or can also be filled by the device located at<br>
a side of the PPP link receiving the DHCP message, or can also be filled on both sides. The solution<br>
of filling on both sides is good in compatibility in the case that devices of different manufactures are<br>
combined to deploy the network and there is no need to worry that relevant information fails to be<br>
input in the devices of other factories at the peer end as required by the current manufacturer.<br>
An embodiment of DHCP interactive process on the PPP link is shown in Fig. 4, wherein<br>
definition of the DHCP message can be found in standard protocols such as RFC 1541.<br>
At 410, the subordinate device sends out DHCP DISCOVER message on the PPP link<br>
already established. The IP address of the subordinate device itself is filled in the address of the<br>
current PPP port.<br>
The process goes to 420, in which the superior device receives the DHCP DISCOVER<br>
message on the PPP link, and fills in the PPP link identifier upon receipt.<br>
The superior device assigns the maintenance IP address in accordance with an IP address<br>
assigning algorithm and bind the assigned maintenance IP address with the hardware address (in this<br>
embodiment, a PPP link identifier) in the DHCP DISCOVER message, and then transmits DHCP<br>
OFFER message to the subordinate device via the PPP link. Server address in the message can be<br>
filled with the address of one end of the PPP link and client address in the message can be filled with<br>
the address of the other end of the PPP link; alternatively, server address and client address in the<br>
message   may not be filled at all.<br><br>
The process subsequently goes to 430, in which the subordinate device receives the DHCP<br>
OFFER message, and then sends DHCP request message to request the superior device for<br>
configuration information.<br>
Going then to 440, the superior device receives the request from the subordinate device,<br>
sends DHCP ACK message to the subordinate device, and the configuration information, for<br>
example, the maintenance IP address, of the device can be carried in the extended options of DHCP.<br>
Alternatively, it is also possible to carry the configuration information of the device by means of<br>
other fields of DHCP response, such as the fields of sname or the fields of file.<br>
The present embodiment does not put specific requirements on the superior and subordinate<br>
devices. By way of an example, the superior device may be a base station controller, and the<br>
subordinate device may be a base station. Setup of the base station can be accomplished by defining<br>
the OPTION field of the DHCP frame to obtain the addresses of the maintenance IP and the access IP<br>
all at once.<br>
The type of Option employed in one concrete example is 43, as shown in Table 2; specific<br>
contents of self-defined Option fields are as shown in Table 3.<br><br><br><br>
The base station can obtain all configuration information required by the maintenance<br>
channel all at once through the DHCP process on PPP, so that it is possible to automatically obtain<br>
configuration information of the device via PPP on such serial links as El/Tl, thus it can greatly<br>
reduce the operational amount of manual maintenance, allow good compatibility of protocols, make<br>
full use of support from the currently available DHCP protocols, and enable the use of existent<br>
DHCP management and maintenance tools.<br>
As a preferred solution in the present embodiment, the base station obtains all configuration<br>
information required by the maintenance channel all at once, but the embodiments of the present<br>
invention is not limited thereto, as it is also possible to accomplish transmission of the configuration<br>
information in several times, and only a part of the configuration information is transmitted in each<br>
DHCP process.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention makes improvement over the above<br>
embodiment. The system for obtaining configuration information as proposed in the above<br>
embodiment includes a superior device and a subordinate device connected to each other via a PPP<br>
link, of which the subordinate device includes a module adapted to request the superior device for<br>
configuration information on the PPP link via a DHCP message, and the superior device includes a<br>
module adapted to transmit to the subordinate device configuration information on the PPP link via a<br>
DHCP message. The PPP link of the superior and subordinate devices can be established on any<br><br>
serial line, which includes, but is not limited to, RS232 port, El, Tl, Jl, E3, T3, etc.<br>
In addition, the superior device and/or the subordinate device can further include a module<br>
adapted to add an identifier of the PPP link to the DHCP message upon transmission of the DHCP<br>
message for requesting the configuration information from the subordinate device to the superior<br>
device.<br>
The superior device may further include a module adapted to transmit to the subordinate<br>
device configuration information corresponding to the identifier of the PPP link via a DHCP message,<br>
according to the identifier of the PPP link in the DHCP message from the subordinate device for<br>
requesting the configuration information.<br>
The process of obtaining the configuration information is described below.<br>
When the superior device and/or the subordinate device transmit(s) the DHCP message<br>
carrying the configuration information requested by the subordinate device from the superior device,<br>
an identifier capable of being used for uniquely identifying the PPP link is added to the DHCP<br>
message.<br>
The superior device transmits configuration information corresponding to the identifier<br>
capable of being used for uniquely identifying the PPP link to the subordinate device via the DHCP<br>
message.<br>
For example, when the superior device receives the DHCP DISCOVER message, it fills the<br>
hardware address with the PPP link number in the DHCP DISCOVER message in accordance with<br>
the PPP link of the DHCP DISCOVER message, finds out the corresponding configuration<br>
information in accordance with the PPP link number, and carries the configuration information to the<br>
subordinate device via the DHCP ACK message.<br>
By employing the assignment strategy of binding the configuration information of the<br>
subordinate device with the PPP link number, it is possible to achieve correlation between the<br>
configuration information of the device and the physical location of the PPP link, so that there is no<br>
need for maintenance operation during replacement of devices in the original site or change of<br><br>
locations of the original device, and the configuration information of the device can be automatically<br>
obtained in accordance with the physical location. Thus, during configuration of the whole network,<br>
once central device nodes are configured, all subordinate nodes can automatically obtain<br>
configuration information, thereby greatly reducing configuration conflict and the operational<br>
amount of configuration.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention involves the technical solution of obtaining<br>
configuration information of the device on the PPP link via the DHCP message.<br>
Structure of the system for obtaining configuration information is as shown in Fig. 2. It<br>
includes a superior device and a subordinate device connected to each other via a serial link, which<br>
includes, but is not limited to, RS232 port, El, Tl, Jl, E3, T3, etc.<br>
Both the superior and subordinate devices include modules adapted to establish the PPP link<br>
via IPCP layer negotiation.<br>
The superior device further includes a module adapted to carry configuration information in<br>
at least one predetermined negotiation parameter of an IPCP message, and transmit the configuration<br>
information to the subordinate device via the PPP link between the superior device and the<br>
subordinate device.<br>
The subordinate device further includes a module adapted to receive the IPCP message via<br>
the PPP link between the superior device and the subordinate device, and obtain configuration<br>
information from at least one predetermined negotiation parameter in the IPCP message.<br>
Like the case in the previous embodiment, this embodiment does not put specific<br>
requirements on the superior and subordinate devices. By way of an example, the superior device<br>
may be a base station controller, the subordinate device may be a base station, and the configuration<br>
information may be required by the maintenance channel of the base station.<br>
The superior and subordinate devices of the system adapted to obtain configuration<br>
information may not include the module adapted to establish the PPP link through IPCP layer<br>
negotiation, but at this time a PPP link capable of being used for communication is required between<br><br>
the superior device and the subordinate device.<br>
As shown in Fig. 5, the superior and the subordinate devices firstly perform LCP layer<br>
negotiation. IPCP layer negotiation is performed after LCP layer negation is finished. During IPCP<br>
layer negotiation, the superior device carries the configuration information in at least one<br>
predetermined negotiation parameter of the IPCP message and transmits the information to the<br>
subordinate device.<br>
IPCP layer negotiation includes the following steps.<br>
The subordinate device sends a negotiation initiating message to the superior device.<br>
Upon receipt of the negotiation initiating message, the superior device carries such<br>
negotiation parameter options as Primary DNS Server Address, Primary NBNS Server Address,<br>
Secondary DNS Server Address, and Secondary NBNS Server Address in the message in response to<br>
the subordinate device, and carries in these negotiation options the configuration information<br>
required by the subordinate device.<br>
Upon receipt of the negotiation options, the subordinate device obtains the configuration<br>
information from the parameter options of Primary DNS Server Address, Primary NBNS Server<br>
Address, Secondary DNS Server Address, and Secondary NBNS Server Address, and replies a<br>
response message ACK.<br>
Upon receipt of ACK, the superior device sends a negotiation completion message to the<br>
subordinate device.<br>
In order to avoid misuse of the address during docking with the general PPP interface device,<br>
a special IP address or a special rule can be agreed upon for definition and authentication. For<br>
instance, 172.168.89.89 can be used as a special Primary DNS Server Address indicating that what is<br>
carried is the configuration information of the maintenance channel.<br>
The method of address verification can also be used to verify Primary DNS Server Address<br>
(or any other negotiation address) and Secondary DNS Server Address by certain rules, for instance,<br><br>
an invariant special numerical value can be set as the difference of subtracting Secondary DNS<br>
Server Address from Primary DNS Server Address, so as to achieve the objective of making sure<br>
what is transmitted is the configuration information of the maintenance channel.<br>
If it is found that the obtained information does not conform to the predetermined rules, it<br>
will be decided not to use the negotiation options, at which time the subordinate device can sent out a<br>
NACK response to the corresponding options.<br>
In this embodiment the superior device may carry the configuration information through<br>
negotiation parameters which are not used during IPCP layer negation to achieve automatic<br>
configuration of the subordinate device. Such a solution has wide application, and may use standard<br>
protocols, and modification may be made on the protocol configuration without modifying the<br>
protocols themselves. In practical application, a subordinate device configured in this way can be<br>
docked with a superior device carrying configuration information, and can also be docked with an<br>
ordinary PPP peer end device.<br>
As can be seen from the technical solutions of the embodiments of the present invention, the<br>
end of the PPP link replaces the hardware address required in the DHCP message with an identifier<br>
capable of being used for uniquely identifying the device that uses the PPP link to satisfy the<br>
requirements of DHCP on broadcasting and hardware address, so as to make it possible to support<br>
DHCP on the PPP link and transmit DHCP broadcasting message directly via the PPP link.<br>
The identifier capable of being used for uniquely identifying the device that uses the PPP link<br>
can be a marker of the device, and can also be a link number of the PPP link. The implementation<br>
mode thereof is very flexible.<br>
The base station can obtain all configuration information required by the maintenance<br>
channel all at once through the DHCP process on the PPP link, so that it is possible to automatically<br>
obtain configuration information of the device via PPP on such serial links as El/Tl, greatly reduce<br>
the operational amount of manual maintenance, allow good compatibility of protocols, make full use<br>
of support from the currently available DHCP protocols, and enable the use of existent DHCP<br>
management and maintenance tools.<br><br>
By using the link number of the PPP link as the identifier capable of being used for uniquely<br>
identifying the device that uses the PPP link, and by employing the assignment strategy of binding<br>
the configuration information of the subordinate device with the PPP link number, it is possible to<br>
achieve correlation between the configuration information of the device and the physical location of<br>
the PPP link, so that there is no need for maintenance operation during replacement of devices in the<br>
original site or change of locations of the original device, because these can be automatically<br>
obtained. Thus, during configuration of the whole network configuration is only needed on the<br>
central device nodes, and all subordinate nodes may automatically obtain configuration information,<br>
thereby greatly reducing configuration conflict and the work of configuration.<br>
The superior device may carry the configuration information through negotiation parameters<br>
usually not used during IPCP layer negation to achieve automatic configuration of the subordinate<br>
device. Such a solution has wide application, and can use standard protocols, and modification may<br>
be made on the protocol configuration without modifying the protocols themselves. In practical<br>
application, a subordinate device configured may be docked with a superior device that carries<br>
configuration information, and may also be docked with an ordinary PPP peer end device.<br>
Although the present invention has been illustrated and described with reference to<br>
exemplary embodiments in the present invention, it should be understood to persons skilled in the art<br>
that various variations and modifications can be made to the present invention both in form and in<br>
details without departing from the principle and scope of the present invention.<br>
To be noted, the present invention may also be adapted to computer program for carrying out<br>
the above mentioned method and computer readable record medium having the computer program<br>
thereon. The computer readable record medium may include computer readable floppy disk, hard<br>
disk, semiconductor memory, CD-ROM, DVD, Magnetic Optical (MO) and other mediums.<br><br>
