				<td>PPAR ACTIVATORS BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to peroxisome proliferator activator receptor (PPAR) agonists, in particular, PPARa agonists, pharmaceutical compositions containing such agonists and the use of such agonists to treat atherosclerosis, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, diabetes, obesity, osteoporosis and Syndrome X (also known as metabolic syndrome) in mammals, including humans.<br>
Atherosclerosis, a disease of the arteries, is recognized to be the leading cause of death in the United States and Western Europe. The pathological sequence leading to atherosclerosis and occlusive heart disease is well known. The earliest stage in this sequence is the formation of "fatty streaks" in the carotid, coronary and cerebral arteries and in the aorta. These lesions are yellow in color due to the presence of lipid deposits found principally within smooth-muscle cells and in macrophages of the intima layer of the arteries and aorta. Further, it is postulated that most of the cholesterol found within the fatty streaks, in turn, gives rise to development of the "fibrous plaque," which consists of accumulated intimal smooth muscle cells laden with lipid and surrounded by extra-cellular lipid, collagen, elastin and proteoglycans. These cells plus matrix form a fibrous cap that covers a deeper deposit of cell debris and more extracellular lipid. The lipid is primarily free and esterified cholesterol. The fibrous plaque forms slowly, and is likely in time to become calcified and necrotic, advancing to the "complicated lesion," which accounts for the arterial occlusion and tendency toward mural thrombosis and arterial muscle spasm that characterize advanced atherosclerosis.<br>
Epidemiological evidence has firmly established hyperlipidemia as a primary risk factor in causing cardiovascular disease (CVD) due to atherosclerosis. In recent years, leaders of the medical profession have placed renewed emphasis on lowering plasma cholesterol levels, and low density lipoprotein cholesterol in particular, as an essential step in prevention of CVD. The upper limits of "normal" are now known to be significantly lower than heretofore appreciated. As a result, large segments of Western populations are now realized to be at particularly high risk. Additional independent risk factors include glucose intolerance, left ventricular hypertrophy, hypertension, and being of the male sex. Cardiovascular disease is especially prevalent among diabetic subjects, at least in part because of the existence of multiple independent risk factors in this population. Successful treatment of<br><br>
hyperlipidemia in the general population, and in diabetic subjects in particular, is therefore of exceptional medical importance.<br>
In spite of the early discovery of insulin and its subsequent widespread use in the treatment of diabetes, and the later discovery of and use of sulfonylureas, biguanides and thiazolidenediones, such as troglitazone, rosiglitazone or pioglitazone, as oral hypoglycemic agents, the treatment of diabetes could be improved. The use of insulin typically requires multiple daily doses. Determination of the proper dosage of insulin requires frequent estimations of the sugar in urine or blood. The administration of an excess dose of insulin causes hypoglycemia, with effects ranging from mild abnormalities in blood glucose to coma, or even death. Treatment of non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (Type II diabetes, NIDDM) usually consists of a combination of diet, exercise, oral hypoglycemic agents, e.g., thiazolidenediones, and in more severe cases, insulin. However, the clinically available hypoglycemic agents can have side effects that limit their use. In the case of insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (Type I), insulin js usually the primary course qf^ therapy.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In general the compounds of the present invention can be made by processes, which include processes analogous to those known in the chemical arts, particularly in light of the description contained herein. Certain processes for the manufacture of the compounds of the present invention are provided as further<br><br>
features of this invention and are illustrated by the following reaction schemes. Other processes are described in the experimental section.<br>
As an initial note, in the preparation of the Formula I compounds, it is noted that some of the preparation methods useful for the preparation of the compounds described herein may require protection of remote functionality (e.g., primary amine, secondary amine, carboxyl in Formula I precursors). The need for such protection will vary depending on the nature of the remote functionality and the conditions of the preparative methods and can be readily determined by one of ordinary skill in the art. The use of such protection/deprotection methods is also within the ordinary skill in the art. For a general description of protecting groups and their use, see T.W. Greene, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis. John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1991.<br>
For example, in the reaction schemes below, certain Formula I compounds contain primary amines or carboxylic acid functionalities, which may interfere with reactions at other sites of the molecule if left unprotected. Accordingly, such functionalities may be protected by an appropriate protecting group, which may be removed in a subsequent step. Suitable protecting groups for amine and carboxylic acid protection include those protecting groups commonly used in peptide synthesis (such as N-t-butoxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, and 9-fluorenylmethylenoxycarbonyl for amines and lower alkyl or benzyl esters for carboxylic acids) which are generally not chemically reactive under the reaction conditions described and can typically be removed without chemically altering other functionality in the Formula I compound.<br>

Enantiomers can be separated by, for example, chiral HPLC methods or converting the enantiomeric mixture into a diastereomeric mixture by reaction with an<br>
appropriate optically active compound (e.g. alcohol), separating the diastereomers and converting (e.g. hydrolyzing) the individual diastereomers to the corresponding pure enatiomoers. Also, an enantiomeric mixture of the Formula I compounds or an intermediate in their synthesis, which contain an acidic or basic moiety, can be separated into their corresponding pure enantiomers by forming a distereomeric salt with an optically pure chiral base or acid (e.g. 1-phenyl-ethyl amine or tartic acid) and separating the diastereomers by fractional crystallization followed by neutralization to break the salt, thus providing the corresponding pure enantiomers.

A lipase inhibitor can serve as the second compound in the combination therapy aspect of the present invention. A lipase inhibitor is a compound that inhibits the metabolic cleavage of dietary triglycerides into free fatty acids and monoglycerides. Under normal physiological conditions, lipolysis occurs via a two-step process that involves acylation of an activated serine moiety of the lipase enzyme. This leads to the production of a fatty acid-lipase hemiacetal intermediate, which is then cleaved to release a diglyceride. Following further deacylation, the        -lipase-fatty acid intermediate is cleaved, resulting in free lipase, a monoglyceride and a fatty acid. The resultant free fatty acids and monoglycerides are incorporated into bile acid-phospholipid micelles, which are subsequently absorbed at the level of the brush border of the small intestine. The micelles eventually enter the peripheral circulation as chylomicrons. Such lipase inhibition activity is readily determined by those skilled in the art according to standard assays (e.g., Methods Enzymol. 286: 190-231).<br>
Pancreatic lipase mediates the metabolic cleavage of fatty acids from triglycerides at the 1- and 3-carbon positions. The primary site of the metabolism of<br><br>
" ingested fats is in the duodenum and proximal jejunum by pancreatic lipase, which is usually secreted in vast excess of the amounts necessary for the breakdown of fats in the upper small intestine. Because pancreatic lipase is the primary enzyme required for the absorption of dietary triglycerides, inhibitors have utility in the treatment of obesity and the other related conditions. Such pancreatic lipase inhibition activity is readily determined by those skilled in the art according to standard assays (e.g., Methods Enzymol. 286:190-231).<br>
Gastric lipase is an immunologically distinct lipase that is responsible for approximately 10 to 40% of the digestion of dietary fats. Gastric lipase is secreted in response to mechanical stimulation, ingestion of food, the presence of a fatty meal or by sympathetic agents. Gastric lipolysis of ingested fats is of physiological importance in the provision of fatty acids needed to trigger pancreatic lipase activity in the intestine and is also of importance for fat absorption in a variety of physiological and pathological conditions associated with pancreatic insufficiency. See, for example, C.K. Abrams, et al., Gastroenterology, 92,125 (1987). Such gastric lipase inhibition activity is readily determined by those skilled in the art according to standard assays (e.g., Methods Enzymol. 286:190-231).<br>

Any glucosidase inhibitor can be used in combination with a Formula I compound of the present invention. A glucosidase inhibitor inhibits the enzymatic hydrolysis of complex carbohydrates by glycoside hydrolases, for example amylase or maltase, into bioavailable simple sugars, for example, glucose. The rapid metabolic action of glucosidases, particularly following the intake of high levels of carbohydrates, results in a state of alimentary hyperglycemia which, in adipose or diabetic subjects, leads to enhanced secretion of insulin, increased fat synthesis and a reduction in fat degradation. Following such hyperglycemias, hypoglycemia frequently occurs, due to the augmented levels of insulin present. Additionally, it is known chyme remaining in the stomach promotes the production of gastric juice, which initiates or favors the development of gastritis or duodenal ulcers. Accordingly, glucosidase inhibitors are known to have utility in accelerating the passage of carbohydrates through the stomach and inhibiting the absorption of glucose from the intestine. Furthermore, the conversion of carbohydrates into lipids of the fatty tissue and the subsequent incorporation of alimentary fat into fatty tissue deposits is accordingly reduced or delayed, with the concomitant benefit of reducing or<br><br>
\ preventing the deleterious abnormalities resulting therefrom. Such glucosidase<br>
inhibition activity is readily determined by those skilled in the art according to standard assays (e.g., Biochemistry (1969) 8: 4214).<br>
A generally preferred glucosidase inhibitor includes an amylase inhibitor. An amylase inhibitor is a glucosidase inhibitor that inhibits the enzymatic degradation of starch or glycogen into maltose1.

Osteoporosis is a systemic skeletal disease, characterized by low bone mass and deterioration of bone tissue, with a consequent increase in bone fragility and susceptibility to fracture. In the U.S., the condition affects more than 25 million people and causes more than 1.3 million fractures each year, including 500,000 spine, 250,000 hip and 240,000 wrist fractures annually. Hip fractures are the most serious consequence of osteoporosis, with 5-20% of patients dying within one year, and over 50% of survivors being incapacitated.<br><br>
The elderly are at greatest risk of osteoporosis, and the problem is therefore predicted to increase significantly with the aging of the population. Worldwide fracture incidence is forecasted to increase three-fold over the next 60 years, and one study has estimated that there will be 4.5 million hip fractures worldwide in 2050.<br>
Women are at greater risk of osteoporosis than men. Women experience a sharp acceleration of bone loss during the five years following menopause. Other factors that increase the risk include smoking, alcohol abuse, a sedentary lifestyle and low calcium intake.<br>

Other estrogen agonist/antagonists are described in U.S. patent 4,133,814 (the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference). U.S. patent 4,133,814 discloses derivatives of 2-phenyl-3-aroyl-benzothiophene and 2-phenyl-3-aroylbenzothiophene-1 -oxide.<br>
Other anti-osteoporosis agents, which can be used as the second agent in combination with a Formula I compound of the present invention, include, for example, the following: parathyroid hormone (PTH) (a bone anabolic agent);         :ii parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretagogues (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 6,132,774), particularly calcium receptor antagonists; calcitonin; and vitamin D and vitamin D analogs.<br>
The starting materials and reagents for the above described Formula I compounds of the present invention and combination agents, are also readily available or can be easily synthesized by those skilled in the art using conventional methods of organic synthesis. For example, many of the compounds used herein, are related to, or are derived from compounds in which there is a large scientific interest and commercial need, and accordingly many such compounds are commercially<br><br>
available or are reported in the literature or are easily prepared from other commonly available substances by methods which are reported in the literature.<br>
Some of the Formula I compounds of the present invention or intermediates in their synthesis have asymmetric carbon atoms and therefore are enantiomers or diastereomers. Diasteromeric mixtures can be separated into their individual diastereomers on the basis of their physical chemical differences by methods known Eerse^, for example, by chromatography and/or fractional crystallization. Enantiomers can be separated by, for example, chiral HPLC methods or converting the enantiomeric mixture into a diasteromeric mixture by reaction with an appropriate optically active compound (e.g., alcohol), separating the diastereomers and converting (e.g., hydrolyzing) the individual diastereomers to the corresponding pure enantiomers. Also, an enantiomeric mixture of the Formula I compounds or an intermediate in their synthesis which contain an acidic or basic moiety may be separated into their compounding pure enantiomers by forming a diastereomeric salt with an optically pure chiral base or acid (e.g., 1-phenyl-ethyl amine or tartaric acid) and separating the diasteromers by fractional crystallization followed by neutralization to break the salt, thus providing the corresponding pure enantiomers. All such isomers, including diastereomers, enantiomers and mixtures thereof are considered as part of the present invention. Also, some of the compounds of the present invention are atropisomers (e.g., substituted biaryls) and are considered as part of the present invention.<br>
More specifically, the Formula I compounds of the present invention can be obtained by fractional crystallization of the basic intermediate with an optically pure chiral acid to form a diastereomeric salt. Neutralization techniques are used to remove the salt and provide the enantiomerically pure compounds. Alternatively, the Formula I compounds of the present invention may be obtained in enantiomerically enriched form by resolving the racemate of the final compound or an intermediate in its synthesis (preferably the final compound) employing chromatography (preferably high pressure liquid chromatography [HPLC]) on an asymmetric resin (preferably Chiralcel™ AD or OD (obtained from Chiral Technologies, Exton, Pennsylvania)) with a mobile phase consisting of a hydrocarbon (preferably heptane or hexane) containing between 0 and 50% isopropanol (preferably between 2 and 20 %) and between 0 and 5% of an alkyl amine (preferably 0.1% of diethylamine). Concentration of the product containing fractions affords the desired materials.<br><br>
Some of the Formula I compounds of the present invention are acidic and they form a salt with a pharmaceutically acceptable cation. Some of the Formula I compounds of the present invention are basic and they form a salt with a pharmaceutically acceptable anion. All such salts are within the scope of the present invention and they can be prepared by conventional methods such as combining the acidic and basic entities, usually in a stoichiometric ratio, in either an aqueous, non-aqueous or partially aqueous medium, as appropriate. The salts are recovered either by filtration, by precipitation with a non-solvent followed by filtration, by evaporation of the solvent, or, in the case of aqueous solutions, by lyophilization, as appropriate. The compounds can be obtained in crystalline form by dissolution in an appropriate solvent(s) such as ethanol, hexanes or water/ethanol mixtures.<br>
Those skilled in the art will recognize that some of the compounds herein can exist in several tautomeric forms. All such tautomeric forms are considered as part of the present invention. For example all enol-keto forms of the compounds of Formula I of the present invention are included in this invention.<br>
In addition, when the Formula I compounds of the present invention form hydrates or solvates they are also within the scope of the present invention.<br>
The Formula I compounds of the present invention, their prodrugs and the salts of such compounds and prodrugs are all adapted to therapeutic use as agents that activate peroxisome proliferator activator receptor (PPAR) activity in mammals, particularly humans. Thus, it is believed the compounds of the present invention, by activating the PPAR receptor, stimulate transcription of key genes involved in fatty acid oxidation and also those involved in high density lipoprotein (HDL) assembly (for example apolipoprotein Al gene transcription), accordingly reducing whole body fat and increasing HDL cholesterol. By virtue of their activity, these agents also reduce plasma levels of triglycerides, VLDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and their associated components in mammals, particularly humans, as well as increasing HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein Al. Hence, these compounds are useful for the treatment and correction of the various dyslipidemias observed to be associated with the development and incidence of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease, including hypoalphalipoproteinemia and hypertriglyceridemia.<br>
Given the positive correlation between triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, and their associated apolipoproteins in blood with the development of cardiovascular, cerebral vascular and peripheral vascular diseases, the Formula I compounds of the present<br><br>
invention, their prodrugs and the salts of such compounds and prodrugs, by virtue of their pharmacologic action, are useful for the prevention, arrestment and/or regression of atherosclerosis and its associated disease states. These include cardiovascular disorders (e.g., angina, cardiac ischemia and myocardial infarction) and complications due to cardiovascular disease.<br>
Thus, given the ability of the Formula I compounds of the present invention, their prodrugs and the salts of such compounds and prodrugs to reduce plasma triglycerides and total plasma cholesterol, and increase plasma HDL cholesterol, they are of use in the treatment of diabetes, including impaired glucose tolerance, diabetic complications, insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome, as described previously. In addition, the Formula I compounds are useful for the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome. Also, the Formula I compounds are useful in the treatment of obesity given the ability of the Formula I compounds of this invention, their prodrugs and the salts of such compounds and prodrugs to increase hepatic fatty acid oxidation.<br>
The utility of the Formula I compounds of the present invention, their prodrugs and the salts of such compounds and prodrugs as medical agents in the treatment of the above described disease/conditions in mammals (e.g. humans, male or female) is demonstrated by the activity of the compounds of the present invention in one or more of the conventional assays and in vivo assays described below. The in vivo assays (with appropriate modifications within the skill in the art) can be used to determine the activity of other lipid or triglyceride controlling agents as well as the compounds of the present invention. Thus, the protocols described below can also be used to demonstrate the utility of the combinations of the agents (i.e., the compounds of the present invention) described herein. In addition, such assays provide a means whereby the activities of the Formula I compounds of the present invention, their prodrugs and the salts of such compounds and prodrugs (or the other agents described herein) can be compared to each other and with the activities of other known compounds. The results of these comparisons are useful for determining dosage levels in mammals, including humans, for the treatment of such diseases. The following protocols can of course be varied by those skilled in the art.<br>

[1] GST/ PPAR LBD Expression. The human PPARa LBD (amino acids 235-507) is fused to the carboxy terminus of glutathione S-transferase (GST) in pGEX-6P-1 (Pharmacia, Piscataway, N.J.). The GST/PPARoc LBD fusion protein is expressed in BL21[DE3]pLysS cells using a 50 uM IPTG induction at room temperature for 16 hr (cells induced at an Aeooof ~0.6). Fusion protein is purified on glutathione sepharose 4B beads, eluted in 10 mM reduced glutathione, and dialyzed against 1x PBS at 4°C. Fusion protein is quantitated by Bradford assay (M:M. Bradford, Analst. Biochem. 72:248-254; 1976), and stored at -20°C in 1x PBS containing 40% glycerol and 5 mM DTT.<br>
[2] FRET Assay. The FRET assay reaction mix consists of 1x FRET buffer (50 mM Tris-CI pH 8.0, 50 mM KCI, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 1 mM EDTA, and 2 mM DTT) containing 20 nM GST/ PPARa LBD, 40 nM of SRC-1 peptide (amino acids 676-700, 5'-long chain biotin-CPSSHSSLTERHKILHRLLQEGSPS-NH2, purchased from American Peptide Co., Sunnyvale, CA), 2 nM of europium-conjugated anti-GST antibody (Wallac, Gaithersburg, MD), 40 nM of streptavidin-conjugated APC (Wallac), and control and test compounds. The final volume is brought to 100 ul with water and transferred to a black 96-well plate (Microfuor B, Dynex (Chantilly, VA)). The reaction mixes are incubated for 1 hr at 4°C and fluorescence is read in Victor 2 plate reader (Wallac). Data is presented as a ratio of the emission at 665 nm to the emission at 615nm.<br><br>
Assessment of lipid-modulating activity in mice<br>
[1] Triglyceride lowering. The hypolipidemic treating activity of the compounds of the present invention can be demonstrated by methods based on standard procedures. For example, the in vivo activity of these compounds in decreasing plasma triglyceride levels may be determined in hybrid B6CBAF1/J mice.<br>
Male B6CVAF1/J mice (8-11 week old) are obtained from The Jackson Laboratory and housed 4-5/cage and maintained in a 12hr light/12hr dark cycle. Animals have ad lib. access to Purina rodent chow and water. The animals are dosed daily (9 AM) by oral gavage with vehicle (water or 0.5% methyl cellulose 0.05% Tween 80) or with vehicle containing test compound at the desired concentration. Plasma triglycerides levels are determined 24 hours after the administration of the last dose (day 3) from blood collected retro-orbitally with heparinized hematocrit tubes. Triglyceride determinations are performed using a commercially available Triglyceride E kit from Wako (Osaka, Japan).<br>
[2] HDL cholesterol elevation. The activity of the compounds of the present invention for raising the plasma level of high density lipoprotein (HDL) in a mammal can be demonstrated in transgenic mice expressing the human apoAl and CETP transgenes (HuAICETPTg). The transgenic mice for use in this study are described •previously in Walsh et al., J. Lipid Res. 1993, 34: 617-623, Agellon et al., J. Biol. Chem. 1991, 266: 10796-10801. Mice expressing the human apoAl and CETP transgenes are obtained by mating transgenic mice expressing the human apoAl transgene (HuAITg) with CETP mice (HuCETPTg).<br>
Male HuAICETPTg mice (8-11 week old) are grouped according to their human apo Al levels and have free access to Purina rodent chow and water. Animals are dosed daily by oral gavage with vehicle (water or 0.5% methylcellulose 0.05% Tween 80) or with vehicle containing test compound at the desired dosed for 5 days. HDL-cholesterol and human apoAl are determined initially (day 0) and 90 minutes post dose (day 5) using methods based on standard procedures. Mouse HDL is separated from apoB-containing lipoproteins by dextran sulfate precipitation as described elsewhere (Francone etal., J. Lipid. Res. 1996, 37:1268-1277). Cholesterol is measured enzymatically using a commercially available cholesterol/HP Reagent kit (Boehringer MannHeim, Indianapolis, IND) and spectrophotometrically quantitated on a microplate reader. Human apoAl is<br><br>
measured by a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay a\s previously described (Francone et al., J. Lipid. Res. 1996, 37:1268-1277).<br>
Measurement of glucose lowering in the ob/ob mouse<br>
The hypoglycemic activity of the compounds of the present invention can be determined by the amount of test compound that reduces glucose levels relative to a vehicle without test compound in male ob/ob mice. The test also allows the determination of an approximate minimal effective dose (MED) value for the in vivo reduction of plasma glucose concentration in such mice for such test compounds.<br>
Five to eight week old male C57BL/6J-ob/ob mice (obtained from Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) are housed five per cage under standard animal care practices. After a one-week acclimation period, the animals are weighed and 25 microliters of blood are collected from the retro-orbital sinus prior to any treatment. The blood sample is immediately diluted 1:5 with saline containing 0.025% sodium heparin, and held on ice for metabolite analysis. Animals are assigned to treatment groups so that each group has a similar mean for plasma glucose concentration. After group assignment, animals are dosed orally each day for four days with the vehicle consisting of either (1) 0.25% w/v methyl cellulose in water without pH<br>
V<br>
adjustment; or (2) 0.1% Pluronic® P105 Block Copolymer Surfactant (BASF Corporation, Parsippany, NJ) in 0.1% saline without pH adjustment. On day 5, the animals are weighed again and then dosed orally with a test compound or the vehicle alone. All compounds are administered in vehicle consisting of either. (1) 0.25% w/v methyl cellulose in water; (2) 10% DMSO/0.1% Pluronic® in 0.1% saline without pH adjustment; or 3) neat PEG 400 without pH adjustment. The animals are then bled from the retro-orbital sinus three hours later for determination of blood metabolite levels. The freshly collected samples are centrifuged for two minutes at 10,000 x g at room temperature. The supernatant is analyzed for glucose, for example, by the Abbott VP™ (Abbott Laboratories, Diagnostics Division, Irving, TX) and VP Super System® Autoanalyzer (Abbott Laboratories, Irving, TX), or by the Abbott Spectrum OCX™ (Abbott Laboratories, Irving, TX) using the A-Gent™Glucose-UV Test reagent system (Abbott Laboratories, Irving, TX) (a modification of the method of Richterich and Dauwalder, Schweizerische Medizinische Wochenschrift, 101: 860 (1971)) (hexokinase method) using a 100 mg/dl standard. Plasma glucose is then calculated by the equation: Plasma glucose (mg/dl)=Sample value x 8.14 where 8.14 is the dilution factor, adjusted for plasma hematocrit (assuming the hematocrit is 44%).<br><br>
The animals dosed with vehicle maintain substantially unchanged hyperglycemic glucose levels (e.g., greater than or equal to 250 mg/dl), animals treated with compounds having hypoglycemic activity at suitable doses have significantly depressed glucose levels. Hypoglycemic activity of the test compounds is determined by statistical analysis (unpaired t-test) of the mean plasma glucose concentration between the test compound group and vehicle-treated group on day 5. The above assay carried out with a range of doses of a test compound allows the determination of an approximate minimal effective dose (MED) value for the in vivo reduction of plasma glucose concentration.<br>
Measurement of insulin, triqlvceride. and cholesterol levels in the ob/ob mouse<br>
The compounds of the present invention are readily adapted to clinical use as hyperinsulinemia reversing agents, triglyceride lowering agents and hypocholesterolemic agents. Such activity can be determined by the amount of test compound that reduces insulin, triglycerides or cholesterol levels relative to a control vehicle without test compound in male ob/ob»mice.<br>
Since the concentration of cholesterol in blood'is closely related to the development of cardiovascular, cerebral vascular or peripheral vascular disorders, the compounds of the present invention, by virtue of their hypocholesterolemic action, prevent, arrest and/or regress atherosclerosis.<br>
Since the concentration of insulin in blood is related to the promotion of vascular cell growth and increased renal sodium retention, (in addition to the other actions, e.g., promotion of glucose utilization) and these functions are known causes of hypertension, the compounds of the present invention, by virtue of their hypoinsulinemic action, prevent, arrest and/or regress hypertension.<br>
Since the concentration of triglycerides in blood contributes to the overall levels of blood lipids, the compounds of the present invention, by virtue of their triglyceride lowering and/or free fatty acid lowering activity prevent, arrest and/or regress hyperlipidemia.<br>
Free fatty acids contribute to the overall level of blood lipids and independently have been negatively correlated with insulin sensitivity in a variety of physiologic and pathologic states.<br>
Five to eight week old male C57BL/6J-ob/ob mice (obtained from Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) are housed five per cage under standard animal care practices and fed standard rodent diet ad libitum. After a one-week acclimation<br><br>
period, the animals are weighed and 25 microliters of blood are collected from the retro-orbital sinus prior to any treatment. The blood sample is immediately diluted 1:5 with saline containing 0.025% sodium heparin, and held on ice for plasma glucose analysis. Animals are assigned to treatment groups so that each group has a similar mean for plasma glucose concentration. The compound to be tested is administered by oral gavage as an about 0.02% to 2.0% solution (weight/volume (w/v)) in either (1) 10% DMSO/0.1% Pluronic® P105 Block Copolymer Surfactant (BASF Corporation, Parsippany, NJ) in 0.1% saline without pH adjustment or (2) 0.25% w/v methylcellulose in water without pH adjustment. Alternatively, the compound to be tested can be administered by oral gavage dissolved in or in suspension in neat PEG 400. Single daily dosing (s.i.d.) or twice daily dosing (b.i.d.) is maintained for 1 to, for example, 15 days. Control mice receive the 10% DMSO/0.1% Pluronic® P105 in 0.1% saline without pH adjustment or the 0.25% w/v methylcellulose in water without pH adjustment, or the neat PEG 400 without pH adjustment.<br>
Three hours after the last dose is administered, the animals are sacrificed and blood is collected into 0.5 ml serum separator tubes containing 3.6 mg of a 1:1 weight/weight sodium fluoride: potassium oxalate mixture. The freshly collected samples are centrifuged for two minutes at 10,000 x g at room temperature, and the serum supernatant is transferred and diluted 1:1 volume/volume with a 1TIU/ml aprotinin solution in 0.1% saline without pH adjustment.<br>
The diluted serum samples are then stored at -80°C until analysis. The thawed, diluted serum samples are analyzed for insulin, triglycerides, free fatty acids and cholesterol levels. Serum insulin concentration is determined using Equate® RIA INSULIN kits (double antibody method; as specified by the manufacturer) available from Binax, South Portland, ME. The interassay coefficient of variation is 
 <br>
100 and 300 mg/dl standards. Serum free fatty acid concentration is determined utilizing a kit from WAKO (Osaka, Japan), as adapted for use with the Abbott VP™ and VP Super System® Autoanalyzer (Abbott Laboratories, Irving, TX), or the Abbott Spectrum CCX™ (Abbott Laboratories, Irving, TX). Serum insulin, triglycerides, free fatty acids and total cholesterol levels are then calculated by the equations: Serum insulin (uU/ml) = Sample value x 2; Serum triglycerides (mg/dl) = Sample value x 2; Serum total cholesterol (mg/dl) = Sample value x 2; Serum free fatty acid (n-Eq/l) = Sample value x 2; where 2 is the dilution factor.<br>
The animals dosed with vehicle maintain substantially unchanged, elevated serum insulin (e.g., 275 uU/ml), serum triglycerides (e.g., 235 mg/dl), serum free fatty acid (1500 mEq/ml) and serum total cholesterol (e.g., 190 mg/dl) levels. The serum insulin, triglycerides, free fatty acid and total cholesterol lowering activity of the test compounds are determined by statistical analysis (unpaired t-test) of the mean serum insulin, triglycerides, or total cholesterol concentration between the test compound group and the vehicle-treated control group.<br>
Measurement of energy expenditure in rats<br>
As would be appreciated by those skilled in the relevant art, during increased energy expenditure, animals generally consume more oxygen. In addition, metabolic fuels such as, for example, glucose and fatty acids, are oxidized to CO2 and H2O with the concomitant evolution of heat, commonly referred to in the art as thermogenesis. Thus, the measurement of oxygen consumption in animals, including humans and companion animals, is an indirect measure of thermogenesis. Indirect calorimetry is commonly used in animals, e.g., humans, by those skilled in the relevant art to measure such energy expenditures.<br>
Those skilled in the art understand that increased energy expenditure and the concomitant burning of metabolic fuels resulting in the production of heat may be efficacious with respect to the treatment of, e.g., obesity.<br>
The ability of the Formula I compounds of the present invention to generate a thermogenic response can be demonstrated according to the following protocol: This in vivo screen is designed to evaluate the efficacy of compounds that are PPAR agonists, using as an efficacy endpoint measurement of whole body oxygen consumption. The protocol involves: (a) dosing fatty Zucker rats for about 6 days, and (b) measuring oxygen consumption. Male fatty Zucker rats having a body weight range of from about 400 g to about 500 g are housed for from about 3 to<br><br>
about 7 days in individual cages under standard laboratory conditions prior to the initiation of the study. A compound of the present invention and a vehicle is administered by oral gavage as a single daily dose given between about 3 p.m. to about 6 p.m. for about 6 days. A compound of the present invention is dissolved in vehicle containing about 0.25 % of methyl cellulose. The dosing volume is about 1 ml.<br>
About 1 day after the last dose of the compound is administered, oxygen consumption is measured-using an open circuit, indirect calorimeter (Oxymax, Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH 43204). The Oxymax gas sensors are calibrated with N2 gas and a gas mixture (about 0.5 % of CO2, about 20.5 % of O2, about 79 % of N2) before each experiment. The subject rats are removed from their home cages and their body weights recorded. The rats are placed into the sealed chambers (43 x 43 x 10 cm) of the Oxymax, the chambers are placed in the activity monitors, and the air flow rate through the chambers is then set at from about 1.6 L/min to about 1.7 L/min. The Oxymax software then calculates the oxygen consumption (mL/kg/h) by the rats based on the flow rate of air through the chambers and the difference in oxygen content at the inlet and output ports. The activity monitors have 15 infrared light beams spaced about one inch apart on each axis, and ambulatory activity is recorded when two consecutive beams are broken, and the results are recorded as counts.<br>
Oxygen consumption and ambulatory activity are measured about every 10 min for from about 5 h to about 6.5 h. Resting oxygen consumption is calculated on individual rats by averaging the values excluding the first 5 values and the values obtained during time periods where ambulatory activity exceeds about 100 counts.<br>
In Vivo Atherosclerosis Assay<br>
Anti-atherosclerotic effects of the compounds of the present invention can be determined by the amount of compound required to reduce the lipid deposition in rabbit aorta. Male New Zealand White rabbits are fed a diet containing 0.2% cholesterol and 10% coconut oil for 4 days (meal-fed once per day). Rabbits are bled from the marginal ear vein and total plasma cholesterol values are determined from these samples. The rabbits are then assigned to treatment groups so that each group has a similar mean ±SD for total plasma cholesterol concentration, HDL cholesterol concentration and triglyceride concentration. After group assignment, rabbits are dosed daily with compound given as a dietary admix or on a small piece of gelatin<br><br>
based confection. Control rabbits receive only the dosing vehicle, be it the food or the gelatin confection. The cholesterol/coconut oil diet is continued along with the compound administration throughout the study. Plasma cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglyceride values can be determined at any point during the study by obtaining blood from the marginal ear vein. After 3-5 months, the rabbits are sacrificed and the aortae are removed from the thoracic arch to the branch of the iliac arteries. The aortae are cleaned of adventitia, opened longitudinally and then stained with Sudan IV as described by Holman et. al. (Lab. Invest. 1958, 7, 42-47). The percent of the surface area stained is quantitated by densitometry using an Optimas Image Analyzing System (Image Processing Solutions; North Reading MA). Reduced lipid deposition is indicated by a reduction in the percent surface area stained in the compound-receiving group in comparison with the control rabbits.<br>
Administration of the compounds of the present invention can be via any method which delivers a compound of this invention systemically and/or locally. These methods include oral routes, parenteral, intraduodenal routes, etc. Generally, the compounds of this invention are administered orally, but parenteral administration (e.g., intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous or intramedullary) may be utilized, for example, where oral administration is inappropriate or where the patient is unable to ingest the drug.<br>
In general an amount of a compound of the present invention is used that is sufficient to achieve the therapeutic effect desired (e.g., lipid lowering).<br>
In general an effective dosage for the Formula I compounds of the present invention, their prodrugs and the salts of such compounds and prodrugs is in the range of about 0.001 to about 100 mg/kg/day, preferably about 0.005 to about 5 mg/kg/day.<br>
A dosage of the combination pharmaceutical agents to be used in conjuction with the PPAR agonists is used that is effective for the indication being treated. Such dosages can be determined by standard assays such as those referenced above and provided herein. The combination agents may be administered simultaneously or sequentially in any order.<br>
For example, typically an effective dosage for HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors is in the range of about 0.01 to about 100 mg/kg/day.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are generally administered in the form of a pharmaceutical composition comprising at least one of the compounds of<br><br>
this invention together with a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle, diluent or carrier. Thus, the compounds of the present invention can be administered individually or together in any conventional oral, parenteral, rectal or transdermal dosage form.<br>
For oral administration a pharmaceutical composition can take the form of solutions, suspensions, tablets, pills, capsules, powders, and the like. Tablets containing various excipients such as sodium citrate, calcium carbonate and calcium phosphate are employed along with various disintegrants such as starch and preferably potato or tapioca starch and certain complex silicates, together with binding agents such as polyvinylpyrrolidone, sucrose, gelatin and acacia. Additionally, lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, sodium lauryl sulfate and talc are often very useful for tabletting purposes. Solid compositions of a similar type are also employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules; preferred materials in this connection also include lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols. A preferred formulation is a solution or suspension injan oil, for example olive oil, Miglyol™ or Capmul™,Jn a soft gelatin capsule. Antioxidants may be added to prevent long term degradation as appropriate. When aqueous suspensions and/or elixirs are desired for oral administration, the compounds of the present invention can be combined with various sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents, emulsifying agents and/or suspending agents, as well as such diluents as water, ethanol, propylene glycol, glycerin and various like combinations thereof.<br>
For purposes of parenteral administration, solutions in sesame or peanut oil or in aqueous propylene glycol can be employed, as well as sterile aqueous solutions of the corresponding water-soluble salts. Such aqueous solutions may be suitably buffered, if necessary, and the liquid diluent first rendered isotonic with sufficient saline or glucose. These aqueous solutions are especially suitable for intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous and intraperitoneal injection purposes. In this connection, the sterile aqueous media employed are all readily obtainable by standard techniques well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
For purposes of transdermal (e.g., topical) administration, dilute sterile, aqueous or partially aqueous solutions (usually in about 0.1% to 5% concentration), otherwise similar to the above parenteral solutions, are prepared.<br>
Methods of preparing various pharmaceutical compositions with a certain amount of active ingredient are known, or will be apparent in light of this disclosure, to<br><br>
those skilled in this art. For examples of methods of preparing pharmaceutical compositions, see Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences. Mack Publishing Company, Easter, Pa., 19th Edition (1995).<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions according to the present invention may contain 0.1%-95% of the compound(s) of the present invention, preferably 1%-70%. In any event, the composition or formulation to be administered will contain a quantity of a compound(s) according to the present invention in an amount effective to treat the disease/condition of the subject being treated, e.g., atherosclerosis.<br>
Since the present invention has an aspect that relates to the treatment of the disease/conditions described herein with a combination of active ingredients, which may be administered separately, the invention also relates to combining separate pharmaceutical compositions in kit form. The kit comprises two separate pharmaceutical compositions: a compound of Formula I of the present invention, a prodrug thereof or a salt of such compound or prodrugs and a second compound as described above. The kit comprises means for containing the separate compositions such as a container, a divided bottle or a divided foil packet. Typically the kit comprises directions for the administration of the separate components. The kit form is particularly advantageous when the separate components are preferably administered in different dosage forms (e.g., oral and parenteral), are administered at different dosage intervals, or when titration of the individual components of the combination is desired by the prescribing physician.<br>
An example of such a kit is a so-called blister pack. Blister packs are well known in the packaging industry and are being widely used for the packaging of pharmaceutical unit dosage forms (tablets, capsules, and the like). Blister packs generally consist of a sheet of relatively stiff material covered with a foil of a preferably transparent plastic material. During the packaging process, recesses are formed in the plastic foil. The recesses have the size and shape of the tablets or capsules to be packed. Next, the tablets or capsules are placed in the recesses and the sheet of relatively stiff material is sealed against the plastic foil at the face of the foil which is opposite from the direction in which the recesses were formed. As a result, the tablets or capsules are sealed in the recesses between the plastic foil and the sheet. Preferably the strength of the sheet is such that the tablets or capsules can be removed from the blister pack by manually applying pressure on the recesses<br><br>
whereby an opening is formed in the sheet at the place of the recess. The tablet or capsule can then be removed via said opening.<br>
It may be desirable to provide a memory aid on the kit, e.g., in the form of numbers next to the tablets or capsules whereby the numbers correspond with the days of the regimen which the tablets or capsules so specified should be ingested. Another example of such a memory aid is a calendar printed on the card, e.g., as follows "First Week, Monday, Tuesday, ...etc.... Second Week, Monday, Tuesday,..." etc. Other variations of memory aids will be readily apparent. A "daily dose" can be a single tablet or capsule or several pills or capsules to be taken on a given day. Also, a daily dose of a compound of the present invention can consist of one tablet or capsule while a daily dose of the second compound can consist of several tablets or capsules and vice versa. The memory aid should reflect this.<br>

NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian XL-300 (Varian Co., Palo Alto, California), a Bruker AM-300 spectrometer (Bruker Co., Billerica, Massachusetts) or a Varian Unity 400 at ambient temperature.  Chemical shifts are expressed in parts per million (8) relative to residual solvent as an internal reference. The peak shapes are denoted as follows: s, singlet; d, doublet; dd, doublet of doublets, t, triplet, q, quartet; m, multiplet; brs=broad singlet; 2s, two singlets. Atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) mass spectra in alternating positive and negative ion mode were obtained on a Fisons Platform II Spectrometer, Fisons Instruments Manchester U.K.). Chemical ionization mass spectra were obtained on a Hewlett-Packard 5989 instrument (Hewlett-Packard Co., Palo Alto, California) (ammonia ionization, PBMS). Where the intensity of chlorine or bromine-containing ions are described, the expected intensity ratio was observed (approximately 3:1 for ^Cl/^CI-containing ions and 1:1 for ^Br/^Br-containing ions) and the intensity of only the lower mass ion is given.  Optical rotations were determined on a Perkin-Elmer 241 polarimeter (Perkin-Elmer Instruments, Norwaik, CT) using the sodium D line (X = 589 nm) at the<br><br>
indicated temperature and are reported as follows [a]Dtemp, concentration (c = g/100 ml), and solvent.<br>
Column chromatography was performed with either Baker Silica Gel (40 urn) (J.T. Baker, Phillipsburg, N.J.) or Silica Gel sn (*=M Sciences, Gibbstown, N J.) in glass columns or in Flash 40 (Biotage, Dyar Corp. Charlottesville, VA) columns under low nitrogen pressure. Radial Chromatography was performed using a Chromatron (model 7924T, Harrison Research, Palo Alto, CA). Unless otherwise specified, reagents were used as obtained from commercial sources. Dimethylformamide, 2-propanol, tetrahydrofuran, toluene and dichloromethane used as reaction solvents were the anhydrous grade supplied by Aldrich Chemical Company (Milwaukee, Wl). Microanalyses were performed by Schwarzkopf Microanalytical Laboratory, Woodside, NY. The terms "concentrated" and "evaporated" refer to removal of solvent at 5-200 mm of mercury pressure on a rotary evaporator with a bath temperature of less than 45°C. Reactions conducted at "0-20°C" or "0-25°C" were conducted with initial cooling of the vessel in an insulated ice bath which was then allowed to warm to room temperature. The abbreviation "min" and "h" stand for "minutes" and "hours" respectively. The abbreviation "it" stands for "room temperature." Other abbreviations, which would be readily understandable to one of ordinary skill in the art, are used, such as the following: "N2" stands for nitrogen; "CH2CI2" stands for dichloromethane; THF" stands for tetrahydrofuran; "NaHCO3" stands for sodium bicarbonate.<br>
