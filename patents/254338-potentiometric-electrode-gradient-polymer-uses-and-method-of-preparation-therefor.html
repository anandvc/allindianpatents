The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br>
1<br><br>
The present invention relates to the field of potentiometric electrodes, gradient polymers and electrical or sensing components comprising said gradients. It also relates to methods for preparing potentiometric electrodes and gradient polymers.<br>
BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION<br>
Potentiometric electrodes have widespread applications in the fields of biology, chemistry, and medicine. They are used for detecting and measuring the concentration of ion species in solution, the best known example being the pH-meter. The operating principles are well known.<br>
Potentiometric electrodes can also be used as sensors to detect analytes. Analyte may be any desired target that has a corresponding ionophore that is capable of specifically interacting with target substances of interest. Examples of analytes include organic acids, amines, amino alcohols and pharmaceutical drugs. Such electrodes combined with suitable ionophores are capable of detecting a corresponding analyte. The applications of potentiometric electrodes are numerous, including biomedical research, clinical testing, obtaining drug data, industrial pollution testing, food testing and chemical-process control.<br>
At present, there is a strong drive towards application of electrochemical sensing of ionizable substances in miniaturized techniques, such as capillary electrophoresis, and microchip arrays.<br>
Potentiometric electrodes coupled to separation methods (e.g. High Performance Liquid Chromatography, "HPLC") are practically non-existing. However, such methods can give access to many interesting substances which are available in minute quantities only, and often in admixture with other substances. For these applications, sensors with low specificity are required, in contrast to batch techniques in which high specificity is required.<br>
Patent application EP 0 767 372 A1 discloses a substrate electrode comprising an epoxy resin (or polyester-, or polyimide resin) cylinder containing carbon fibers. A classical poly (vinylchloride) (PVC) -based potentiometric membrane is coated on this substrate electrode.<br>
2<br><br>
The authors made a sophisticated design to optimize the membrane - substrate electrode contact,<br>
Patent application EP 0 684 466 A2 discloses a substrate electrode which is a solid conductor or semiconductor. It is coated with a classical PVC/plasticiser/ionophore mixture, plus an additional conductive polymer.<br>
Patent application EP 0 300 662 A2 discloses a conventional coated wire potentiometric electrode which is optimized for the measurement of cationic and anionic surfactants.<br>
Patent application U.S. 5,552,032 describes a chloride (or generally, a halide ion) sensitive potentiometric electrode. It is a variant of the potentiometric sensors based on silver halide crystal electrode materials.<br>
A problem with potentiometric electrodes of the prior art is the lack of stability (potential drift), mechanical robustness and sensitivity. Their life span is unpredictable, so requiring regular financial expenditure in the form of maintenance on the part of the owner. Furthermore, they are unsuitable for use in HLPC detection and Capillary Electrophoresis (CE) detection, dissolution testing of pharmaceuticals, wherein their behaviour is difficult to predict, and some designs cannot be used with the ion-pairing agent frequently used in HPLC and CE separations or with the detergents used in dissolution testing.<br>
There is clearly a need for a new potentiometric electrode, suitable for use in sensing analytes which overcomes the problems of the prior art.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a potentiometric electrode for detecting analytes in a sample<br>
comprising<br>
- a sensing body made substantially from polymeric material comprising:<br>
-	electrically conducting particles, which increase in concentration away from a sample contact surface,<br>
-	ionophore molecules, which increase in concentration towards the sample contact surface, and<br>
-	an electrical connection which passes proximal to said electrically conducting<br>
particles.<br>
Thus, one embodiment of the present invention is an analyte-selective potentiometric electrode having a sample contact surface, said electrode being substantially formed from polymeric material, said polymeric material comprising:<br>
-	electrically conducting particles, which increase in concentration away from the sample contact surface,<br>
-	ionophore molecules capable of binding to said analyte, which increase in concentration towards the sample contact surface, and<br>
-	an electrical connection which passes proximal to said electrically conducting<br>
particles.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention is a gradient polymer present in an electrode of the present invention.<br>
According to one embodiment of the present invention a gradient polymer is substantially formed from polymeric material comprising two surfaces, said polymeric material comprising:<br>
-	electrically conducting particles, which decrease in concentration away from one surface,<br>
-	ionophore molecules which decrease in concentration away from the other surface,<br>
13<br><br>
-	optionally an electrical connection which passes proximal to said electrically<br>
conducting particles.<br>
According to one embodiment of the present invention a gradient polymer is substantially formed from polymeric material comprising two surfaces, said polymeric material comprising:<br>
-	electrically conducting particles, which decrease in concentration away from both<br>
surfaces,<br>
-	optionally electrical connection(s) which  passes  proximal to said electrically<br>
conducting particles.<br>
An electrode or gradient polymer according to the invention, which comprises polymeric material throughout has been found by the inventors to be extremely mechanically robust and sensitive. Furthermore, such an electrode or gradient polymer is suitable for use in HPLC, CE and pharmaceutical applications such as dissolution testing and retains its sensitivity during very long operations. In the area of dissolution testing, the inventors have found that the robust potentiometric electrode performs more reliably than the presently widely used spectroscopic UV fiber-optics sensors. The electrode or gradient polymer does not have a separate and distinct membrane comprising ionophore molecules. Instead, the part of the electrode or gradient polymer comprising ionophore molecules is part of the polymeric material of the body, and the electrode or gradient polymer is one piece. Furthermore, the electrode or gradient polymer is more robust and the inventors have found it is free of abrupt changes in potential which can occur at unpredictable intervals with conventional "coated-wire" electrodes. When it is described that the concentration of a ionophore or electrically conducting particle increases or decreases, it means such change is not abrupt but is gradual or progressive. As elaborated below, the change in concentration of ionophore or electrically conducting particle is a gradient over distance in respect of the longitudinal body or in respect of the sample contact surface. It is mechanically more stable because there is no abrupt interface between the ionically conducting part and the electronically conducting part.<br>
The sensing body of the electrode comprises the gradient polymer, said gradient having a variety of applications including use in a flow cell, a dissolution sensor, battery, variable resistor, variable capacitor, pressure sensor and solvent or lipophilic molecular sensor.<br>
14<br><br>
One embodiment of the present invention is an electrode or gradient polymer as disclosed herein wherein the electrical connection is made of any conducting metal such as silver, platinum, gold, aluminium.<br>
Another embodiment the present invention is an electrode or gradient polymer as disclosed herein wherein the electrical connection is made of copper. The use of copper provides good conductivity and is inexpensive. Because an electrode or gradient polymer of the invention can avoid the use of precious metal such as gold, silver or platinum, said electrode provides for a very low cost device.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention is an electrode or gradient polymer as disclosed herein, wherein polymeric material is any polymeric material which is in the rubber state, or which is brought into this state by the addition of plasticiser. Examples of such materials include poly(n-butylacrylate), poly(butylacrylate), cross-linked poly(butylacrylate), polycarbonate, polystyrene, polymethylmethacrylate, poly(vinylchloride-co-vinylacetate-co-vinylalcohol), polysiloxane, DC 200 silicon oil, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), or high molecular weight PVC or a combination of two or more thereof.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention is an electrode or gradient polymer as disclosed herein, wherein polymer is polyvinyl chloride (PVC). The inventors have found that PVC provides good strength and is compatible with the electrically conducting particles and ionophores of the electrode or polymer gradient.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention is an electrode or gradient polymer as disclosed herein, wherein the polymer comprises poly(butylacrylate). The electrode may comprise poly(butylacrylate), or poly(butylacrylate) in combination with PVC. The inventors have found that provides good adhesive properties for the construction of the electrode and is compatible with the electrically conducting particles and ionophores of the electrode.<br>
The region of polymeric material comprising ionophore molecules (Figure 1,11) is also known herein the membrane, while the remainder of the polymeric material (Figure 1, 10), which comprises electrically conducting particles is also known as the conducting composite.<br>
15<br><br>
According to one aspect of the invention, the membrane region comprises more plasticiser than the conducting composite region.

Other electrically conducting particles suitable for use according to the invention include, but are not limited to electropolymerised materials (or any other ion electron converter) such as oxidized polypyrole and its derivatives, oxidized polythiophenes and polyaniline, noble metals, gold or platinum.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention is an electrode or gradient polymer as disclosed herein, wherein the electrically conducting particles are of one type (e.g. all graphite powder). Another embodiment of the present invention is an electrode as disclosed herein, wherein the<br>
17<br><br>
electrically conducting particles are of more than one type. For example, an electrode may comprise electrically conducting particles of graphite powder and gold.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention is an electrode or gradient polymer as disclosed herein, wherein an ionophore molecule is any molecule suitable for non-covalent binding to the analyte of interest. According to one embodiment of the invention, an ionophore specifically binds to an analyte. According to one embodiment of the invention, an ionophore specifically binds to a group of related analytes. By recognizing one analyte, or a groups of analytes, an ionophore according to the invention enables the specific qualitative and/or quantitative detection of said analytes in the presence of other substances.<br>
An analyte as used herein is the substance of interest which is detectable using an electrode or gradient polymer of the invention. To be useful in the invention, the analyte is ionizable i.e. it can form cations and/or anions. For example, an analyte may be a cation present in a liquid, in a gel, on a surface, in a sample etc. According to the invention, an analyte or a family of related analytes binds specifically to an ionophore present in an electrode or gradient polymer of the invention.<br>
A sample according to the invention is any in which an analyte is capable df being present i.e., in which an analyte is ionisable. A sample may take the form of, for example, a liquid, a vapour, a gel, a vapour, a semi-solid, a liquid film, a moisture film, a suspension, a colloid, an heterogenous mixture, an homologous mixture, etc. Examples of samples include, but are not limited to food-stuffs, drinks, bodily fluids, drinking water, waste water, environmental specimens, chemical-production samples, chemical samples, biological samples etc. *<br>
According to one aspect of the invention, the analyte is present as an ion pair in the electrode or gradient polymer, particularly in membrane region.<br>
lonophores may be any of the art, including tetra (p-chloro)phenylborate (TCPB) for cationic analytes, and methyltridodecylammoniumchloride (MTDDACI) for anionic analytes. Other ionophores are any molecular recognition compound which can be made soluble in the lipophilic electrode material or gradient polymer, and insoluble in a hydrophilic sample. Examples synthesized by applicants for the determination of organic acids are given in Figure<br>
18<br><br>
11. Other ionophores known in the art suitable for use in the present invention include those mentioned in Buhlmann et al. Chemical Reviews 1998 Vol. 98 No 4 p 1650-1687 which is incorporated herein by reference. Other ionophores known in the art suitable for use in the present invention include calixarenes (e.g. Figure 11 compounds 11,12 and 15) crown ethers (e.g. Figure 11 compounds 16, 17, 18 and 21) cyclodextrins (e.g. Figure 11 compound 19) phosphoryl derivates (e.g. Figure 11 compound 20) and antibiotics (e.g. Figure 11 compounds 13 and 14). Improved solubility characteristics may be obtained by incorporating a lipophilic "tail" into the molecular recognition compound.<br>
The sensitivity and selectivity of potentiometric electrodes of the art for the determination of organic ionizable analytes is largely determined by the lipophilicity of the analyte. Best results are obtained with analytes having large positive log P values, wherein P is the distribution coefficient of the analyte over a n-octanol/water two phase system. Most organic acids from the food and drinks industry have low (negative) log P values, and will, therefore, be difficuK targets. The inventors have found that a combination of the electrode or gradient polymer as described herein, and a group of urea- or azamacrocycle-based ionophores as shown in Figure 11 allows the detection of such lipophilic analytes, thereby enabling important analyses to be performed in batch and in HPLC modes.<br>
According to one aspect of the invention, an ionophore is based on a ureum derivative or on an azamacrocycle, and is any selected from the group consisting of compounds 1 to 10 in Figure 11.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention is an electrode or gradient polymer as disclosed herein, wherein the concentration of ionophore is a gradient across the longitudinal body of the electrode or gradient polymer. The concentration of ionophore is highest towards one surfaces when a single gradient is present. When two gradient polymers are disposed 'back to back' as mentioned below, the concentration ionophore is highest towards the midpopint. One aspect of the invention is an electrode or gradient polymer as disclosed herein, wherein the maximum concentration of ionophore in the membrane region is 0.1 to 20 %, 0.1 to 10 %, 0.1 to 9 %, 0.1 to 8 %, 0.1 to 7 %, 0.1 to 6 %, 0.1 to 5 %, 0.1 to 4 %, 0.1 to 3 %, 0.1 to 2 %, 0.1 to 1 %, and is preferably 1 %, most preferably 1 to 2% ionophore. For the determination of organic acids, this ionophore is any one of the molecules from Figure 11. These surface-<br>
19<br><br>
active receptor molecules largely increase the detectability for organic acids. MTDDACI is added in a 0.2% ratio to obtain good ionic conductivity.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention is an electrode or gradient polymer as disclosed herein, where the ionophores comprise a single ionophore (e.g. the ionophores are all compound 1 of Figure 11). Another embodiment of the present invention is an electrode as disclosed herein, wherein the ionophores are an heterogenous mix of at least two ionophores. For example, an electrode may comprise a mixture of compound 1 and 2 shown in Figure 11.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention is an electrode or gradient polymer as disclosed herein, wherein the minimum concentration of ionophore in the membrane region is 0 to 0.09 %, 0 to 0.08 %, 0 to 0.07 %, 0 to 0.05 %, 0 to 0.025 %, and is preferably 0 % ionophore.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention is an electrode or gradient polymer as disclosed herein, wherein the electrical connection does not pass through a zone of ionophore particles.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the ionophore molecules and the electrically conducting particles mix in a transition region between the zone of minimum concentration of ionophore molecules and the zone of minimum concentration of electrically conducting particles.<br>
According to an aspect of the invention, the transition region has a depth of less than or equal to 10, 50,100, 200, 300,400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900,1000 or 3000 micrometers, or a value in the range between any two of the aforementioned depths. The depths may be in the range of 10 to 1000 micrometer, 50 to 500 micrometer, 100 to 400 micrometers, 200 to 300 ,100 to 200 and 50 to 100 micrometers and preferably less than or equal to 200 micrometers.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, the nearest boundary of the transition region is located between 1 and 400, 10 and 400 micrometer, 50 and 300 micrometers, 70 and 200 micrometers and preferably 100 micrometers from the sample contact surface.<br>
In this transition region, a conversion of ionic-to-electronic conductivity takes place more efficiently. According to another aspect of the invention, the depth of the transition region<br>
20<br><br>
and/or the distance of its boundary from the sample contact surface is such that ionic-to-electronic conductivity takes place efficiently.<br>
The gradient polymer and electrode as described herein, comprises a gradient of electrically conducting particles and ionophores present in the electrode forms a continuous transition from one functional layer to another. This transition can be of any type including linear, exponential or curved as shown in Figures 3a, 3b and 3c respectively . The gradient may be continuous. Alternatively, the gradient may not be completely continuous, but may progress in discrete steps (Figure 4) which follow a linear (Figure 4a), exponential (Figure 4b) or S-profile (Figure 4a), for example. The gradient may be symmetrical or non-symmetrical (e.g. Figure 5 shows a non symmetrical gradient).<br>
The gradient between the conducting composite and the membrane secures a mechanically strong adherence of the membrane to the conductor. The gradient from the pure composite to the pure membrane spans typically 200 micrometers, but it can vary from 10 to 1000 micrometers. The inventors have observed that branches of composite (graphite/PVC) can extend into the membrane (PVC, DOS and ions), isolated particles of graphite extend far into the membrane even in regions near to the surface. Due to the extreme low concentration of these particles in these regions, they do not reduce dramatically the impedance of the electrode. A microscopy photograph of the membrane isolator gradient is shown in Figure 7. From this, the inventors deduced a concentration distribution in the gradient shown in Figure 6. For this distribution a linear variation of concentration was presumed, however the other presented models could also apply.<br>
Within an electrode or gradient polymer of the present invention, other gradients may be present depending on the material used to make the isolator. Besides the gradient between conducting composite and a gradient membrane, there may be a gradient between the isolator and the membrane and a gradient between the isolator and the conductor. For each of these gradients there may be different gradient profiles for each component.<br>
The gradient between the isolator and the membrane secures a mechanically strong adherence of the membrane to the insulator. Furthermore this gradient has a higher impedance than the membrane and prevents any short-circuit. The gradient from the pure<br>
21<br><br>
isolator to the pure membrane spans typically 200 micrometers, but it can vary from 10 to 1000 micrometers. From the microscopy photograph of the membrane isolator gradient in Figure 7 we deduced a concentration distribution in the gradient shown in Figure 5. For this distribution a linear variation of concentration was presumed, however the other presented models could also apply.<br>
The gradient between the isolator and conducting composite is similar to the previous gradients, and is an unintended result of the electrode production as described above. The gradient may evolve from a graphite concentration equal to or greater than 90, 80, 70, 60, 50, 40, 30, or 20% (or a value in the range between any of the two aforementioned values) to a concentration of 0% in the isolator. The concentration of PVC may evolve from a concentration equal to or less than 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, or 80% (or a value in the range between any of the two aforementioned values) to a concentration equal to or less than 90, 95, or 100% in the isolator. Preferably, the concentration gradient evolves from 60 % graphite 40% PVC to 0 % graphite 100% PVC. The length of this gradient is smaller, and can vary from 1 to 100 micrometers but can be larger.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the electrode or gradient polymer further comprises a housing (also known herein as an isolator). The housing encloses at least part of a longitudinal body of the polymeric material. The housing leaves the sample contact surface at least partly exposed. Said housing may serve a number of purposes, for example, one or more of the following:<br>
-	to physically protect the sensing portion when present in an electrode,<br>
-	to provide a reaching means for the sensing portion when incorporated into an electrode,<br>
-	to insulate the electrical connection.<br>
The housing may be constructed from any insulating material such as glass, PVC, polycarbonate, polypropylene etc. It is preferably made of PVC. The use of a PVC housing and solvent during preparation of the electrode leads to an isolator-membrane gradient and a isolator conductor composite gradient as described above, owning a solublisation of part of the housing by the solvent.<br>
22<br><br>
Another embodiment of the present invention is an electrode or gradient polymer as disclosed herein, wherein the housing is a cylindrical jacket.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the polymeric material is cylindrical in shape.<br>
A cylindrical shape of the electrode or gradient polymer allows an electrode so formed to have an sample contact surface which is circular, so matching the shape of commonly available containers such as micro well plates. Furthermore, this allows the housing of the electrode to be cylindrical, permitting an efficient strength/weight use of housing materials.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the sample contact surface of an electrode, or one or both said surfaces of gradient polymer is circular. The may be between 0.1 and 5 mm, 0.1 and 4 mm, 0.1 and 3 mm, 0.1 and 2 mm, and preferably 3mm.<br>
The inventors have found that an electrode or gradient polymer of the present invention with the lack of an interface provides a mechanically more robust construction which unexpectedly, has enhanced the sensitivity and conductivity properties which are more predictable in daily use.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention is a chromatographic flow cell comprising an electrode or gradient polymer of the present invention.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention is a dissolution electrode comprising an electrode or gradient polymer of the present invention. The inventors have found that a potentiometric electrode made according to the present electrode has a very low drift, and which is predictable (Figure 8). These properties allow measurements to be made inline - i.e. the electrode registers continuously and in real time the concentration changes of the dissolution media; the electrode does not leave the dissolution media during dissolution. This contrasts to potentiometric electrodes of the prior art in which samples are taken out and measured, or the electrode is intermittently introduced into the dissolution solution. Besides the normal calibration curves, additional calibration techniques can be applied to the present electrode or gradient polymer. The measurement of the end concentration is very sensitive to drift; this problem can be suppressed by single point calibration or standard<br>
23<br><br>
addition. Single point calibration usually performed soon after completion of the dissolution by placing the electrode in a known concentration of analyte. This enables the correction of the calibration values for the occurred drift by simple subtraction and interpolation. A known amount of analyte may also be added after completion of the dissolution (standard addition). Since the increase in voltage is proportional to the start concentration and the amount added, the end concentration can be deduced. This also enables the calibration values to be corrected for the occurred drift by simple subtraction and interpolation.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention is a chromatographic flow cell as disclosed herein, further comprising a means to spray eiuent against the electrode or gradient polymer surface. Said configuration is a so called "wall-jet".<br>
The inventors have found that a flow cell according to the invention obviates the main problem with classical flow-cells which is the unpredictable occurrence of high internal resistances. These come from air bubbles sticking to the working electrode, or from reference electrodes with clogged membranes. Both causes are difficult to detect in classical flow cells. Classical cells have to disassembled, and even then, the cause of misfunction is not evident. Furthermore, re-assembling the flow-cell will generally not remove the problem. The latter phenomena make present electrochemical detection impractical for users. The inventors have found that no such phenomena occur with the flow-cell of the present invention. A flow cell according to the invention operates at zero pressure, allows immediate visual inspection of air bubble formation at the electrode, and convenient and effective removal of such in seconds. The reference electrode can also be removed in seconds time. The construction of the flow-cell is such that an industrial standard reference electrode can be plugged in - no-specially constructed reference electrode is needed.<br>
The gradient polymer described herein may comprise two surfaces and a longitudinal body, cylinder, for example, comprising two circular ends and a longitudinal body is a typical sha of construction of gradient polymer. The gradient polymer as already described above r comprise electrically conducting particles increasing in concentration towards one surf and ionophore molecules increasing in concentration towards the other surface. A gra polymer may also comprise two surfaces in which electrically conducting particles decre? concentration towards the midpoint of both surfaces.<br>
24<br><br>
The gradient polymer can be implemented into a device wherever a transition between ionic and electrical conductivity is needed. A gradient polymer may thus be implemented, for example, into batteries.<br>
It may also be implemented as a variable resistor or variable capacitor. In this construction the component is essentially two gradients 'back to back', in which electrically conducting particles decrease in concentration towards the midpoint of both surfaces. The end surfaces of the components comprise a maximum concentration of electrically conducting particles, which reduce in concentration towards the centre (midpoint) of the component. For example, the gradient may run from one end from 60% graphite to 0% graphite in the centre and increases back to 60% at the other end, this profile being shown in Figure 9). The central area may be in the rubber phase at or below room temperature and may contain ions and/or ionophores.<br>
The gradient polymer may also be implemented into a pressure sensor. For such sensor, again two 'back to back' gradients are formed in which electrically conducting particles decrease in concentration towards the midpoint of both surfaces. For example, the gradient may run at one end from 40% PVC 60% graphite to 66% DOS, 44% PVC, 0% graphite in the centre (midpoint) to 40% PVC 60% graphite at the other end. When this gradient is compressed, the capacitance and conductivity varies in proportion to the pressure applied. Hence, a capacitance and/or impedance based pressure sensor is obtained, lonphores may be present or absent in the central area.<br>
The gradient polymer as described in the above embodiments may also by implement into a solvent or lipophilic molecular sensor. Such sensor based on the swelling properties of the gradient. Many solvents become trapped in the gradient polymer and cause swelling of the rubber phase. This characteristic affects the conductivity and capacitance of the sensor. Both properties can be used to determine the solvent concentration. The same system can be used for measurement of detergents and molecules with high log P (&gt;1). These molecules can be in the solution or gas phase.<br>

This allows the electrode so formed to have an sample contact surface which is circular, so matching the shape of commonly available containers such as micro well plates. Furthermore, this allows the housing of the electrode to be cylindrical, permitting an efficient strength/weight use of housing materials. According to an aspect of the invention, the mold may be the housing of the electrode.<br>
The suspension of step (a) may be provided to the mold in one single application, or by consecutive rounds of applying and drying until the desired amount of suspension has been added. The drying may be performed at room temperature or elevated temperature (e.g. higher than 20, 25, 30, 35,40,45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85 or 90 deg C, or a value in the range between any of the two aforementioned temperatures).

The gradient is formed by the dissolving of the composite of step (c) or (d) by the solution of step (d1). Using this procedure, one obtains a gradient layer (transition region) of between 10 and 1000 micrometers in depth.<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
The invention is illustrated by means of the following non-limiting examples<br>
1a. Preparing an electrode (A).<br>
A composite material forming the substantial part of the electrode was made by preparing a<br>
suspension of graphite particles and PVC in THF (tetrahydrofuran). The composite material<br>
was provided onto a copper electrode by evaporating the suspension thereon. After drying<br>
the composite material, the electrode was extended by the addition of ionophore-containing<br>
layers as follows.<br>
Several mixtures were prepared, each containing a different ionophore.<br>
-	A mixture containing compounds 1 to 4 as ionophore comprised 1% compound, 0.2% methyltridodecylammonium chloride (MTDDACI), 33% PVC and 65.8% plasticiser as the final layer contacting the sample.<br>
-	The mixtures based on compounds 5-8 and 10 comprised 1% ionophore, 33% PVC, and 66% plasticiser as the final layer contacting the sample.<br><br>
-	A mixture incorporating compound 9 comprised 1% ionophore, 27% PVC and 72% plasticiser as the final layer contacting the asample.<br>
-	A mixture based on MTDDACI as an ionophore contained 6% MTDDACI, 33% PVC and 61% plasticiser as the final layer contacting the sample.<br>
The anion-sensitive electrodes were conditioned with the running eluent in the LC system until a stable baseline was obtained (few hours).<br>
1b. Preparing an electrode (Alternative B).<br>
An electrode suitable for use in HPLC potentiometric sensing is made of a PVC cylinder (1 x 5 cm) with a central hole of 3mm diameter (see, for example, Figure 1). One side of the hole is sealed by a copper rod. The other side of the hole is filled with conducting composite of 60% graphite and 40% PVC:<br>
1)	A suspension of 60% graphite and 40% high molecular weight PVC in THF (1/3 ratio / solid THF) is prepared by mixing and stirring.<br>
2)	The hole is filled with the suspension of step (1).<br>
3)	The suspension is dried by room or elevated temperature.<br>
4)	Step 2 and 3 are repeated until the hole is completely filled.<br>
36<br><br>
•mmmrnmm<br>
5)       The surplus of graphite/PVC composite is removed by grinding and polishing.<br>
The membrane and the gradient are prepared as described:<br>
1)	65% DOS, 32 % PVC and 2% TCPB are mixed in a 100mg quantity.<br>
2)	This mixture is dissolved in 1 ml THF<br>
3)	One drop (25 ul) is deposed onto the cylinder.<br>
4)	THF is evaporated at room temperature (~5 mm).<br>
5)	Step 3 and 4 are repeated at least three times (in total).<br>
Note: the gradient is formed by dissolving of the composite (60% graphite 40% PVC) in the membrane/THF solution. Using the described procedure one obtains a ± 200um layer in which the concentration of DOS and ions gradually decreases and the concentration of PVC and graphite gradually increases. After hydration one obtains a working electrode.<br>
Life span in HPLC applications<br>
The life span of two electrodes was tested by continuous exposure to a flow of distilled water at a flow rate of 1 ml/mm. At regular intervals the quality of the electrodes was tested by HPLC experiments. These consisted of the separation and potentiometric detection of 6 amines (methyl-, ethyl-, propyl-, butyl-, pentyl- and hexylamine) on a universal cation column (4.6x1 00 Alltech) with a 1mM HN03 5% Acetonitrile eluent. After 4 months and 127 liters of distilled water, the quality of the electrodes was still acceptable for routine potentiometric measurements. The studied time span is equivalent with 1 year of use with a workload of 40 hours/week at a 1 ml/mm flow rate.<br>
1c. Preparing an electrode (Alternative C)<br>
The electrodes for HPLC applications may be adapted to the specific needs of the dissolution application.<br>
The electrodes for use in dissolution applications are prepare as described in Example 1b. The PVC cylinder is glued onto a hollow glass tube with a diameter of 3 mm. In order to protect the glue from the samples, a silicon tube is positioned over the glass PVC transition.<br>
37<br><br>
In order to obtain reproducible measurements in batch (dissolution) the analyte is present as ion pair in the electrode membrane. In order to obtain this ion pair there are three possible procedures:<br>
1)	Introduction of the ion pair by adding it to the membrane components during fabrication (step 1 of membrane preparation).<br>
2)	Adding the analyte to the membrane mixture during step 1 or 2 of membrane preparation.<br>
3)	Post production formation of the ion pair: the ion pair is formed by direct contact of the electrode with a solution of the analyte (e.g. 30 mg/900m1 dapoxetune/0. 1M HC1). During this process the analyte is extracted from the solution into the electrode, and the ion pair is formed in situ. This process takes typically up to 5 hours.<br>
Life Span in dissolution applications<br>
The experimental data enables us to deduce a live span of ~ 6 months for the electrodes in<br>
dissolution applications.<br>
1d. Preparing an electrode (Alternative D)<br>
Alternative preparation of the composite. A uniform composite can be obtained by following method:<br>
1)	A suspension of 60% graphite and 40% high molecular weight PVC in THF (1/3 ratio solid/THF) is prepared by mixing and stirring.<br>
2)	The mixture is injected in distilled water and precipitates.<br>
3)	The precipitate is reduced in size by blending.<br>
4)	The precipitate is filtered and dried.<br>

39<br><br>
The mixture (with our without THF) is applied onto the paste of step 1). The construction is degassed by vacuum. The electrode is heated to 150-200 deg C; the temperature depends on the ratio base/curing agent. After hydration one obtains a working electrode.<br>

E. Journal of the Chemical Society-Chemical Communications 1989, 1521-23. Its N-hexaoctylderivative was obtained as follows: The solution of the hydrochloride salt of the hexa-aza compound (0.40 g, 0.62 mmol) and K2C03 (5 g) in 200 ml dry acetonitrile was stirred for 24 h under nitrogen blanket. A solution of n-octylbromide (0.78 g, 4 mmol) in 50 ml of dry acetonitrile was added dropwise to the stirred mixture. A catalytic amount of tetrabutylammonium iodide (0.15 g) was added and the mixture was refiuxed for two days. The warm mixture was filtered. The solvent was removed in vacuo to give a brownish oil to which 100 ml of sodium hydroxide solution (pH = 12) and 100 ml of chloroform were added. The water phase was extracted several times with additional portions of 100 ml<br>

4.	Instrumentation<br>
Liquid chromatography was performed using a Spectra Physics 8810 isocratic pump, a Valco injector (10 uL loop), column 125x4 mm filled with reversed- phase Lichrospher 100-5 RP-8, (Merck), eluent 1 mM H3P04. The flow-rate was 0.5 mL min"1. The column outlet was directed perpendicularly towards the sensitive membrane of the coated - wire electrode in a flow-cell (Zielinska, D.; Poels, I.; Pietraszkiewicz, M.; Radecki, J.; Geise, H. J.; Nagels, L. J. Journal of Chromatography A 2001, 915, 25-33). The distance from the LC tubing outlet to the electrode was 100 pm. The membrane potential was measured against an Orion 800500 Ross® reference electrode using a high impedance (1013 Q) amplifier. The detection signals were recorded on a PC 1000 data acquisition system from Thermo Separation Products.<br>
5.	Potentiometric detection of organic acids.<br>
A set of 7 (mostly dicarboxylic) acids were used as test substances. These acids are widely found in nature, and in the food/beverage industry. These acids are quite hydrophilic, with log P values mostly lower than (-1) (see Table 1). Membranes, whose components display lipophilic character, have the tendency to be unsensitive to hydrophilic analytes. The choice of the ionophore host molecules is essential. Molecules forming the strongest complex with the ionophore are detected most sensitively.<br>

conditions as upper tracing, injection of commercial lager pills beer after filtration on a 0.45 Mm filter. The electrode coating used contained 33.8% PVC, 66% o-NPOE, 0.2% MTDDACI, and 1% ligand 3.<br>
All components were detected very sensitively, the highest sensitivity being obtained for malonic acid: peak nr. 2 is due to 120 pg. The detection limit for this acid is in the low picogram range. The lower tracing presents a chromatogram of an injected beer sample (lager pills, no cleanup except filtration over a 0.45 urn filter, no dilution, 10 pL injection) in the same conditions. Tartaric- (1) and lactic- (4) acid could be identified.<br>
Figure 13 shows a HPLC chromatogram recorded using a coated-wire electrode incorporating ligand 9 and TOTM. The compound 9, of dendrimeric type, is tightly packed with urea units. Injected concentration: 1x10"5M, peak identification: (1) tartaric acid, (2) malonic acid, (3) malic acid, (4) lactic acid, (5) citric acid, (6) fumaric acid, (7) succinic acid. Electrodes based on compound 9 were less sensitive but showed preference for citric acid (peak 5 in the chromatogram of figure 13).<br>
Figure 14 shows chromatograms obtained using a coated-wire electrode incorporating ligand 10 and TOP as plasticiser. in case of the compound 10, there is only one carbamoyl group available. Trace A) Injected concentration: 1x 10"5 M, peak identification: (1) tartaric acid, (2) malonic acid, (3) malic acid, (4) citric acid, (5) fumaric acid, (6) succinic acid. Trace B) Injected concentration and peak identification: (1) 5x10"4 M tartaric acid, (2) 2x1 O^M malonic acid, (3) 2x10^* M malic acid, (4) 5x10* M lactic acid, (5) 5x10-4 M citric acid, (6) 5x10"6 M fumaric acid, (7) 5x10"4 M succinic acid. Electrodes based on this compound, are very sensitive for fumaric acid (Figure 14).<br>
Table 1 lists detection limits (in pmol injected) of the 7 organic acids, obtained with the chromatographic system described in Example 4, with different ionophores in the potentiometric detector.<br>

Acid		Minimum amount of acid (pmol) required, for detection in electrodes, comprising compound (cmpd) numbers below<br>
		Cmpdl	Cmpd2	Cmpd3	Cmpd4	Cmpd5	Cmpd6	MTDDACI<br>

Table 1:	detection limits (in pmol injected) of electrodes for 7 organic acids.	<br>
Comparing the data obtained for electrodes incorporating the quaternary salt MTDDACI, where only electrostatic interactions occur, it is clear that extra interactions originating from compounds, makes the membranes much more sensitive.<br>
Thus for malonic acid detected on membranes modified by open chain urea (1-4) and macrocyclic compound 8 the detection limit is down to 1 pg (see Table 1). This is two orders of magnitude lower than for MTDDACI based electrodes. All other acids were also detected sensitively, at injected concentrations varying from 4x10"6 to 2x10"5 M.<br>
With hexaamine ionophores possessing alkyl chains, (compounds 5 to 7, Figure 11), detection limits are drastically reduced compared with MTDDACI-based electrodes for 4 of the 7 acids (tartaric, malonic, malic, citric), with the most drastic reduction for malonic acid. All the azamacrocycles with lipophilic alkyl chains display very similar selectivities and detection limits, regardless the size of the macrocyclic cavity (compounds 5 to 7).<br>
Malonic acid, as monoanion, can interact with ionophores electrostatically and by hydrogen bonding (Menif, R.; Martell, A. E. Journal of the Chemical Society-Chemical Communications 1989, 1521-23). Moreover, this acid is less hydrophilic (except of fumaric acid) than other analytes.<br>
The best results for compound 10 were observed for fumaric acid (see Figure 14), but the level of detection of other acids was worse than that for MTDDACI. The compound 10 possesses only one large lipophilic tail with a functional group. Probably, the macrocyclic unit<br>
45<br><br>
does not lie at the membrane-water interface. This could lead to diminished electrostatic interactions of the acids with the compound at the interface.<br>
Generally, detection limits were in the order malonic- (best detected) 
6.	Calibration curves<br>
Figure 15 shows calibration curves obtained for three acids, with an electrode comprising the octaazamacrocycle compound (compound 7). In batch techniques, potentiometric detectors are always used in that part of the calibration curve where the signal (mV) is linearly related to log(Canaiyte). The calibration curve from Figure 15 shows a linear relationship between the signal (peak height or area) and the analyte concentration.<br>
The correlation is high, i.e. p = 0.99999 (n = 5) for malonic acid and at least 0.97 (n = 4) for all other acids listed in Table 1 (not all data are plotted in Figure 15). When used in HPLC conditions, the classical methodology of potentiometry has to be somewhat adapted to the situation. With a potentiometric sensor which continuously monitors the signal, one can work in the lower part of the calibration curve. It has been shown theoretically (De Backer, B. L; Nagels, L. J. Analytical Chemistry 1996,68,4441-45), that in this part of the calibration curve, a linear relationship should be expected between the injected concentration, and the peak area (or peak height). For all acids from Table 1, this linearity was obtained in the 1 to 100 uM region.<br>
7.	Long-term stability of the electrodes.<br>
Electrodes containing the azamacrocyclic compounds 5 and 7 had an operational lifetime (continuous use in chromatographic conditions) of at least 3 months. Their calculated high log P values were 20.6 and 16.7, respectively. Electrodes containing azamacrocyclic compound 6 with a significantly lower logP of 9.18 had a reduced operational lifetime of a few weeks. The minimal lipophilicity log P, required for ionophore-containing electrodes with a lifetime of<br>
46<br><br>
30x24 (days)x(h) upon exposure to an aqueous solution is generally estimated to be around 10. Electrodes containing the open chain urea compounds 1 to 4 also had operational lifetimes in the order of 2 weeks. The log P values of compounds 1 to 4 are 25.4, 10.1, 9.6 and 18.6 respectively.<br>
10 synthetic ligands were tested and compared as ionophores in electrode membranes which are responsive to carboxylic acids. All these ligands largely improved (in comparison to MTDDACI) detection limits for the HPLC determination of the di- and tricarboxylic acids. The highest sensitivities were obtained for the open-chain urea compound 3. Compound 7 combines high sensitivity with long operational lifetime.<br>
8. Application in "Dissolution testing" of pharmaceutical drugs.<br>
Determining the rate of dissolution of an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) from a dosage form is an important quality indicating test in the pharmaceutical industry. Potentiometric sensors can be very useful in this respect. Classical UV detection systems allow only a very limited concentration range to be measured as the useful linear dynamic range of a UV detector is limited (0-2 absorbance units). The output signal of a UV detector gets saturated because the detector's response is linearly related to the concentration of the dissolved substance. Potentiometric sensors have the advantage that their response is dependent on the logarithm of the concentration. This means that if one gets good signals at the low concentration side, even very high concentrations can be monitored without saturating the sensor output voltage. Such behaviour can be seen in Figure 16. Moreover, potentiometric sensors do not suffer from factors limiting the use of spectroscopic methods such as effects of flow cell dimensions, turbidity, and the presence of undissolved particles and of air bubbles.<br>
Dissolution of 8 mg galantamine (spherical particles in capsules marked "reminyl CR") in 100 ml 0.001 M HCI was monitored by a potentiometric electrode of the present invention. The HCI solution was stirred continuously with a magnetic stirring bar. In Figure 17, curve B shows the output signal of the potentiometric sensor. The signal was monitored versus a reference electrode which was also hanging in the HCI solution. Curve A was calculated from curve B using the smoothed data from Figure 16. It shows the concentration versus time<br>
47<br><br>
behavior of the basic drug galantamine. The electrode used contained PVC, tetra (p-chloro)phenylborate (TCPB) as an ionophore, and DOS as a plasticiser.<br>
The observed response profile gives a good description of the dissolution behaviour. The potentiometric electrode of the invention also allows measurements to be done in media which damage the coated wire type electrodes (e.g. media containing detergents).<br>
