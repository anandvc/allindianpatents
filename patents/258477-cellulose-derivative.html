DESCRIPTION CELLULOSE DERIVATIVE TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention, relates to a cell-ulose derivative, a manufacturing method thereof and an adhesion barrier,<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
The adhesion of a living tissue occurs through its bonding to another tissue when the surface of a damaged organ is regenerated. Therefore, various adhesion barriers comprising a polysaccharide such as cellulose which is a biocompatible material are proposed to prevent adhesion after an operation.<br>
For example, an adhesion barrier which is an aqueous solution of carboxymethyl cellulose is proposed (Am J Surg. 169, 154-159 (199S) ) . However, this adhesion barrier cannot exhibit an adhesion inhibition effect to the full due to its low retention properties in vivo.<br>
Therefore, many attempts are being made to modify a polysaccharide by various methods or make it water-insoluble.<br>
For example, adhesion barriers prepared by modifying hyaluronic acid and carboxymethyl cellulose with carbodiimide are proposed (JP-A 5-508161, JP-A 6-508169, Fertil Steril. S6.   904-910 (1996), J Am Coll Surg. 183, 297-306 (1996)) . zvn adhesioH barrier comprising a cellulose I  derivative obtained by substituting the hydrogen atom of cellulose with a specific substituent is further proposed (JP-A 1-301624) . It is also proposed to use a composite material of carboxymethyl cellulose and a polyether as an adhesion barrier (US Patent NO. 5,906,997, US Patent No.<br><br>
6,017,301, US Patent No. 6,024,140). It is further proposed to use a cellulose derivative prepared by making soluble cellulose hardly soluble in water through an acid treatment as an adhesion barrier (wOOl/34214 pamphlet). JP-A 2004-51531 proposes an adhesion barrier containing carboxymethyl cellulose which had been made hardly soluble in water- The adhesion barrier.is siobstantially in a sponge or film form.<br>
US Patent No. 5,064,817'discloses a reaction for obtaining a phospholipase A2 inhibitor composition by reacting carboxymethyl cellulose having a low molecular weight and phosphatidylethanolamine in a water solvent.<br>
Not relating to an adliesion barrier, as means of chemically crosslinking a polysaccharide, it is proposed that carboxymethyl cellulose should be crosslinked by glyoxal (JP-A 10-251447), Further, a composition prepared by mixing carboxymethyl cellulose with a polyvalent metal ion is proposed (JP-A 63-37143) . It is also proposed that hyaluronic acid should be crosslinked by bisepoxide (JP-A 7-97401) , It is further proposed that hyaluronic acid should be crosslixiked by divinyl sulfone (US Patent No. 4,582,865, US Patent No. 4,605,691). It is further proposed that hyaluronic acid should be crosslinked by formaldehyde or divinyl sulfone (JP-A 60-130601). JP-A 2003-518167 discloses a water-insoluble biocompatible gel prepared by reacting a polyanionic polysaccharide with an activator in an aqueous solution containing a water-compatible organic solvent and gives carboxymethyl cellulose as an example of the polyanionic polysaccharide. I       All of the above proposals still have room to study as for adhesion preventing effect, handling properties and safety.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a cellulose derivative which is useful as an adhesion barrier. It is another object of the present invention to provide a cellulose derivative which has a suitable elastic modulus and viscosity and is useful as an adhesion barrier, when it forms a gel. It is still another object of the present invention to provide a gelled adhesion barrier which has excellent retention properties in vivo. It is a further object of the present invention to provide an adhesion barrier which has excellent handling properties, it is a still further object of the present invention to provide a method of manufacturing the cellulose derivative.<br>
The inventors of the present invention have conducted intensive studies to improve an adhesion preventing effect by modifying cellulose with a material having excellent safety to increase its viscosity so as to improve its retention properties in vivo. As a result, the inventors of the present invention have found that a cellulose derivative having a suitable elastic modulus and viscosity and useful as an adhesion barrier can be obtained by substituting the carboxyl group of carboxymethyl cellulose with phosphatidyl ethanolamine which is a substance derived from a living body. The present invention has been accomplished based on this finding.<br>
That is, the present invention is a cellulose derivative having a molecular weight of 5 x 10^ to 5 x 10*" and comprising a repeating unit represented by the following formula (1):<br><br><br><br>
(d) {X in the formula (c) is an alkali metal, and R'* and R^ in the formula (d) are each independently an alkyl group or alkenyl group having 10 to 28 carbon atoms, with the proviso that when the equivalents of (a), (b), (c) and (d) are represented by E (a) , E(b), E(c) andE(d), respectively, E{b) + E(c) -I- E(d)= 0.3 to 3 and E(d)/{E(b) + E (c) + E (d) } = 0.001<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION <cellulose derivative><br>
The present invention is a cellulose derivative having a molecular weight of 5 x 10-* to 5 x lO*' and composed of a repeating unit represented by the following formula (1)*<br><br>
in the formula (1) , R\ R=^ and R^ are each independently selected from the group consisting of the following formulas (a) , (b) , (c) and (d) .<br><br>
In the formula (c) , X is an alkali metal. Examples of the alkali metal include sodium, potassium and lithium.<br>
In the formula (d) , R^ and R^ are each independently an alkyl group or alkenyl group having 10 to 28 carbon atoms.<br><br>
Both R^ and R^ are preferably an alkenyl group having 10 to 20 carbon atoms. Both R^ and R^ are more preferably an oleyl group.<br>
When the equivalents of (a)/ (b), (c) and (d) are represented by E (a) , E(b), E(c) and E (d) , respectively, the total of E(a) , E(b) , E(c) and E(d) is 3. The total of E(b) , E (c) and E (d) is 0 - 3 to 3, preferably 0,5 to 2 / more preferably 0,6 to 1.5. That is, the total of E(b), E(c) and E(d) is the number of substituents represented by the formulas (b) , (c) and (d) when the total number of the substituents R^, R^ and R^ in the repeating unit of the cellulose represented by the formula (l) is 3 equivalents. The ratio of E(b) and E(c) is not particularly limited,<br>
E(d)/{E(b) + E(c) + E(d)} is 0.001 to 1, preferably 0.01 to 1,<br>
E(d)/{E(b) -t- E(c)} is preferably 0.01 to 1, more preferably 0-1 to 1. ■<br>
By controlling the amount of the introduced substituent derived from the phosphatidyl ethanolamine represented by the formula (d), the form of the cellulose derivative can be made gelled or solid. For instance, when E(d)/{E(b) -f' E(c)} is 0.01 to 1 equivalent, the cellulose derivative forms a gel and when it is more than 1 equivalent, the hydrophobic nature of the cellulose derivative becomes high, insoluble matter is produced, a gel is hardly formed, and the cellulose derivative becomes solid.<br>
By controlling the amount of the introduced group of the formula (d), the viscoelasticity and retention properties of the obtained gelled or solid cellulose derivative can be changed. For example, as the amount of the group of the formula (d) introduced into the carboxymethyl cellulose increases, a gel having higher viscosity and elastic modulus is obtained and a gel and a solid having higher retention properties are obtained.<br><br>

The weight average molecular- weight of the cellulose derivative is 5 x 10^ to 5 x 10"'; preferably 5 x lO'^ to 5 x 10^, more preferably 5 x 10'* to 1 x 10*^. The weight average molecular weight of the cellulose derivative increases because the groups of the formulas (b) and (c) in the carboxymethyl cellulose represented by the following formula (1-a) is substituted by the group represented by the formula (d) . That is, the molecular weight increases from that of the carboxymethyl cellulose before the reaction by the modification of the phosphatidyl ethanolamine represented by the formula (2).<br><method of manufacturing cellulose derivative><br>
The cellulose derivative can be manufactured by dissolving (i) components (X). and (Y) in (ii) a ratio that the amount of the component (Y) becomes o. l to lOO equivalents based on 100 equivalents of the total of E(b) and E(G) of tlie component (X) in (iii) a mixed-solvent of water and an organic solvent, having a water content of 20 to 70 vol%r and reacting them in the presence of a catalyst, (component (X))<br>

When the equivalents of (a), (b) and (c) are represented by E (a) , E (b) and E (c) , respectively, the total of E (a) , E (b) and E(c) is 3. The total of E (b) and E{c) is 0,3 to 3, preferably 0,5 to 1.5, more preferably 0-6 to 1.0, That is, the total of E(b) and E(c) is the number of substituents represented by the formulas (b) and (c) when the total number of the substituents R^, R^ and R^ in the component (X) is 3.<br>
The weight average molecular weight of the component (X) is S X 10^ to 5 X loS preferably 5 x 10^ to 5 x loS more preferably 5 x 10* to 1 x 10^.<br>
The component (X) can be manufactured by dissolving pulp (cellulose) in a sodium hydroxide solution, etherifying it with monochloroacetic acid (or a sodium salt) and purifying it.<br>
The structural formula of the preferred carboxymethyl cellulose is the following formula (3) below, and the substitution position of the carboxymethyl group in the cellulose skeleton is preferably the C-6  position.<br><br><br>
  (2)<br>

The phosphatidyl ethanolamine is a safe substance derived from a living body and can enhance hydrophobic nature interaction between the molecules of a cellulose derivative*<br><br>
Therefore, the cellulose derivative of the present invention becomes a hydrogel or a water-insoluble molded product due to the hydrophobic interaction. (reaction)<br>
The component (X) and the component (Y) are reacted with each other in a ratio that the amount of the component (Y) becomes 0,1 to 100 equivalents, preferably 5 to 60 equivalents, more preferably 10 to 50 equivalents based on 100 equivalents of the total of E (b) and E (c) of the component (X) . When the amount of the component (Y) is smaller than, 0 .1 equivalent, the formed cellulose derivative does not form a hydrogel. When the amount is larger than 10 0 equivalents, the hydrophobic nature of the formed cellulose derivative becomes high, insoliible matter is produced, a hydrogel is hardly formed, and the obtained cellulose derivative shows insolubility in an aqueous medium.<br>
The components (X) and (Y) are dissolved in a mixed solvent of water and an organic solvent, having a water content of 20 to 7 0 vol%, and reacted with each other in the presence of a catalyst.<br>
The catalyst is preferably a carboxyl group activator or a coupling agent. Examples of the catalyst include N-hydroxysuccinimide, p-nitrophenol, N-hydroxybenzotriazole, N-hydroxypiperidine, N-hydroxysuccinamide and 2,4,5-trichlorophenol. Examples of the coupling agent include<br>

Examples of the dioxane include l, 4-dioxane and l, 3 -dioxane. Examples of the dioxolan include 1,3-dioxolan,<br>
The reaction temperature is preferably 0 to 60°C. To suppress the formation of a by-product, the reaction is preferably carried out at 0 to lO^C, The reaction environment is preferably a weak acidic environment. It is more preferably at a pH of 6 to 7, <gelled adhesion barrier><br>
The adhesion barrier of the present invention contains a cellulose derivative represented by the formula (1).<br>
The gelled adhesion barrier of the present invention is a hydrogel which contains 0.1 to 5.0 parts by weight, preferably 0.3 to 2.0 parts by weight, more preferably 0.5 to 1.5 parts by weight of the cellulose derivative represented by the formula (1) based on 100 parts by weight of water.<br>
When E(d)/{E(b) + E{c)} is 0.001 to 1 equivalent, the cellulose derivative represented by the formula (1) forms a gel and when E (d) / {E (b) -t- E (c) } is larger than 1 equivalent, the hydrophobic nature of the cellulose derivative becomes high and insoluble matter is produced, thereby making it difficult to form a gel, E(d) /{E{b) + E(c) } of the cellulose derivative represented by the formula (1) is preferably 0.01<br><br>
to 1,<br>
As £or the preferred physica.1 properties of the gel, when the content of a polymer in water is 0.1 to 5 %, the gel has such viscoelasticity that it does not flow down when a vessel containing the gel is inclined, can be easily deformed when it is touched with an apparantus such as metal spatula and can be easily applied to an affected part.<br>
As for the preferred viscoelasticity of the gel/ when the complex elastic modulus of the gel is measured with a viscoelasticity measuring device called rheometer at a polymer concentration in water of 1 wt%, a temperature of 37*C and an angular velocity of 10 rad/sec, it is preferably 100 dyn/cm^ or more, more preferably 200 dyn/cm^ or more.<br>
As E(d)/{E(b) + E(c)} becomes larger, the retention properties of the gel improve, thereby making it possible to exhibit an adhesion preventing effect for a long time. In this respect, JT-(d) /{E(b) -*• E(c) } is preferably 0 .3 or more* That is, E(d)/{E(b) -^ E(c)} of the gelled adhesion barrier of the present invention is preferably 0.3 to 0,8.<br>
It is conceivable that components other than water contained in the adhesion barrier include a coupling agent used as the catalyst, by-products such as urea formed by the predetermined chemical reaction of the condensing agent, a carboxyl group-containing activator, unreacted phosphatidyl ethanolamine, contaminants contained in each stage of the reaction, and ions used for the control of pH. It is preferred that the contents of all of the compounds should be reduced to such low levels that a foreign matter reaction is not perceived when they are introduced into the living body. <solid adhesion barrier><br>
When E(d)/{E(b) -v  E(c)} of the cellulose derivative exceeds 0*5, the hydrophobic nature of the cellulose derivative becomes high, insoluble matter is formed, and the<br><br>
cellulose derivative becomes solid. E(d)/{B(b) + E(c)} of the solid adhesion barrier of the present invention is preferably more than 1 and 5 or less.<br>
Even when the solid adhesion barrier of the present invention is insoluble in an aqueous medium/ if it enters the living body, it can be swollen with a body fluid to change into a gel. The aqueous medium means water, physiological saline, buffer fluid or an aqueous solution containing alcohol. The term ^'insoluble' means that the cellulose derivative stays in the living body for a certain period of time, dissolves gradually and is adsorbed into the living body in the end.<br>
The solid adhesion barrier can be manufactured by molding the cellulose derivative by a freeze dry, dry film formation, wet film formation, electrostatic spinning, solidification spinning/ span bonding, melt blowing or flash spinning method. As for the shape of the solid adhesion barrier, it may be porous like sponge, nonwoven cloth or a film. The solid adhesion barrier may be used as an adhesion barrier for tissues after an operation or skin moisturizing agent.<br>

Comparative Example 1<br>
10 mg of CMCNa was dissolved in 990 mg of ion exchange water to measure the viscoelasticity of the resulting product in the same manner as in Example 1. The results are shown in Table 3.<br><br><br><br><br>
Example 4<br>
The ceca of reits as intraperitoneal adhesion models were caused to bleed petechially and returned into their abdominal cavities, and a hydrogel (1 mL) o£ the cellulose derivative prepared in Example 1 was applied to the abrasion parts of 10 rats. After 29 days, the abdominal parts of the rats were cut open under anesthesia with pentobarbital sodium to check the degree of intraperitoneal adhesion with the naked eye and score it.<br>
Example 5<br>
The procedure of Example 4 was repeated except that a hydrogel (1 mL) of the cellulose derivative prepared in Example 2 was used to check the degree of intraperitoneal adhesion with the naked eye and score it.<br>
Comparative Example 2<br>
The procedure of Example 4 was repeated except that a hydrogel (1 mL) was not applied to the abrasion parts to ;  check the degree of intraperitoneal adhesion with the naked eye and score it.<br>
The intraperitoneal adhesion score of each case was expressed by mean value ± standard error (mean ± S.E.). A<br><br>
Wilcoxoii rank total test wae made on the groups of Examples 4 and 5 and Comparative Example 2, The SAS (Trademark Registration) System Release 8 .2 (TS2M0) for Windows (of SAS Institute Inc.) was used as statistical software and the EXSAS Version 7,10 (of Arm Co., Ltd.) was used as its cooperative system.<br>
