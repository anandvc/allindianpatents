COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10)<br>
COSMETIC COMPOSITION<br>
HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House,  165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br><br>
The  following   specification   particularly  describes  the   nature   of  the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br><br><br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to transparent, storage stable, pourable liquid cosmetic compositions that contain a substantial amount of water and oil for topical application to skin and hair. In particular, the invention relates to transparent, storage stable, pourable liquid cosmetic compositions having a viscosity of from 10 cP to 200 cP.<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART<br>
In many countries, oiling of hair (primarily with vegetable oils) is a common practice. It is also a common practice to apply the oil onto skin. Oil helps in the styling of hair. Oil is also believed to have nutritive and beneficial effects on skin and hair.<br>
Transparency is an important cue for non-adulteration of cosmetic oil and is a consumer desired attribute. Oils containing benefit agents are also desired by consumers. However, many benefit agents (such as vitamins, colorants and proteins) are water soluble or hydrophilic in nature and cannot be incorporated in oils since the oil loses its clarity and transparency.<br>
It would be thus advantageous to provide for liquid cosmetic compositions which appear like oil, which can be easily applied to skin and/or hair and which offer the benefits of oils as well as benefits due to water-soluble functional ingredients. One of the ways of achieving this is by incorporating water in the oil. It is required that the water should be the dispersed phase in the oil in order to retain the advantageous properties of oil. Additionally, it will then be possible to incorporate water soluble benefit agents in these liquid cosmetic compositions.<br>
However, it is required that the liquid cosmetic composition be transparent in nature as transparency in hair and skin oils is perceived as a cue for purity by consumers. Further, the compositions are required to be storage stable as<br><br><br>
compositions comprising water and oil are known to phase separate on storage.<br>
Transparent compositions where water is dispersed in a continuous oil phase are known in the prior art.<br>
Thus,<br>
-WO 9426234 (IBAH Inc.) describes water -in- oil microemulsions containing up to 5 % by wt. water for use as lip balm. The oil is preferably triglyceride and the nonionic surfactant used to obtain the microemulsion is chosen from methyl glucoside derivatives, polyglycerol esters, triglycerol monooleate, monoglycerides and ethoxylated derivatives.<br>
JP 2015015A2 (Kanebo Ltd.) discloses a liquid oily cosmetic having transparency, excellent appearance, storage stability and providing moisture retention, flexibility and moist feeling after application. The formulation contains 3-6 % water and contains a hydrophilic nonionic emulsifier, i.e., polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate.<br>
WO 9302665 (SmithKline Beecham Corporation) relates to a stable, water-in-oil microemulsion that comprises a lipophilic phase, a low HLB (hydrophilic lipophilic balance) surfactant, a high HLB surfactant, an aqueous phase and a water soluble therapeutic agent. The invention provides for microemulsions that have a water content of less than 10%. Further the microemulsion does not use lecithin as a surfactant.<br>
WO 0032153 (University of Nottingham) describes fragrance releasing compositions comprising water-in-oil microemulsion droplets wherein the droplets have low water activity and contain the fragrance. The microemulsions disclosed have about 3% water and more than 80% oil. The compositions may include co-surfactants like short chain alcohols. Lecithin is disclosed as a surfactant.<br><br><br>
US 6004580 (Leiras Oy) deals with pharmaceutical oil-in-water or bi-continuous microemulsions comprising oil, water, a surfactapt and a drug. Up to 10% oil is used to form the microemulsions. Lecithin is used as a surfactant to form these microemulsions. The microemulsions are in the form of gels.<br>
US5298240 (Wella) pertains to a hair care composition in the form of a microemulsion gel containing a) from 5 to 20 percent by weight of nonionic surfactants with an HLB-value of from 5 to 12 or mixtures of the nonionic surfactants, the mixtures having HLB-values of from 6 to 10; b) from 5 to 20 percent by weight of at least one oil; c) from 0.5 to 10 percent by weight of at least one cationic surfactant; and d) from 50 to 89.5 percent by weight water. The said microemulsion is an oil-in-water microemulsion.<br>
Thus, the prior art does not disclose liquid cosmetic compositions comprising oil and more than 10% water. The likely reason for this is that increasing the amount of water would result in non-transparent compositions with poor storage stability.<br>
The present inventors now disclose transparent and storage stable liquid cosmetic compositions comprising oil, at least 10% water, one or more emulsifiers comprising at least 80% lecithin and a co-emulsifier, wherein the oil is the continuous phase. The liquid cosmetic compositions of the invention retain many of the advantageous properties of hair or skin oil, and are capable of being topically applied to skin and/or hair. Both oil and water soluble benefit agents can be incorporated in the liquid cosmetic composition of the invention. The liquid cosmetic compositions are also cooling to the touch.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
!t is an object of the invention to provide for a transparent, storage stable, pourable liquid cosmetic composition comprising oil and at least 10% water that shows the attributes of a hair or skin oil.<br><br><br>
It is a further object of the invention to provide for a transparent, storage stable, pourable liquid cosmetic composition comprising oil and at least 10% water that is cooling to the touch.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide for a transparent, storage stable liquid cosmetic composition comprising oil and at least 10% water that will uniformly coat the surface of the hair.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

METHOD OF MAKING THE TRANSPARENT. STORAGE STABLE COMPOSITION<br>
The method of the making transparent, storage stable composition is as known in the conventional art. Oil (e.g., coconut oil, paraffin oils etc.) and emulsifier are first mixed to form a solution/ homogeneous mixture. The co-emulsifier and water are subsequently added to the solution/homogeneous mixture to obtain the transparent, storage stable liquid cosmetic composition that is a single phase. The mixing can be carried out by conventional means.<br>
If present, water and/or oil-insoluble impurities that reduce the clarity of the composition, are separated by centrifugal action or by filtration.<br>
Reference is made in the examples to accompanying figures.<br><br><br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1<br>
Phase diagrams were determined to obtain water-in-oil transparent, storage stable liquid cosmetic compositions containing coconut oil, water, liquid soybean lecithin and isopropanol (IPA).<br>
Figure 1 represents the phase diagram for (Coconut Oil-Water-liquid soybean lecithin-lsopropanol) at 25 °C wherein the oil to water ratio is 1:1. The figure provides the single-phase (transparent) region and the ratio of soybean lecithin liquid/lPA needed to obtain the transparent, storage stable state.<br>
Using the ratio of soybean lecithin liquid/lPA as obtained from Figure 1, a ternary phase diagram of water, coconut oil and soybean lecithin liquid/lPA (ratio: 78/22) was obtained and is given in Figure 2. The formulation of the transparent, storage stable liquid compositions of the invention forming a single phase are obtained from Figure 2 (unshaded region). In Figure 2, E and co-E stand for emulsifier and co-emutsifier respectively.<br>
Figure 3 is a phase diagram of a (paraffin oil/water/soybean lecithin liquid/1-propanol) system. The paraffin oil (LLPO) is a randomly branched<br>
hydrocarbon. The (0,0) point of the graph represents LLPO:(Water+1-propanol) = 1:1. The single phase, transparent liquid cosmetic compositions are obtained from the unshaded region of the phase diagram. The concentration of 1-propanol in water is given in weight fraction.<br>
The phase diagrams (Figures 1, 2 and 3) clearly indicate that single-phase, transparent, storage stable liquid cosmetic compositions of suitable characteristics are only formed within the range and composition defined by the invention.<br>
The formulation details of transparent, storage stable liquid cosmetic compositions within and outside the invention are presented in Table 1 and 2.<br><br><br><br><br>

The liquid cosmetic compositions of the invention are transparent in the temperature region of 5 to 60 °C. However compositions containing coconut oil (examples 1-4) are opaque at temperatures of 24 °C and below due to the inherent property of coconut oil. On heating to a temperature &gt;24 °C, the liquid cosmetic compositions are transparent up to 60 °C.<br>
Transparency<br>
The transparency of the liquid cosmetic compositions of Examples A-E, Examples 1-5 as well as coconut oil and LLPO were determined. The sample was taken in a quartz cuvette of 1 cm path length. Light transmittance (%T) was measured at 650 nm using a Carry 50 UV-Visible Spectrometer. The wavelength of 650 nm was chosen for measurement as absorption bands due to lecithin were observed at wavelengths less than 600 nm. The sample temperature was 25 degrees centigrade. The higher the percent transmittance, the greater the transparency of the liquid composition. The results are presented in Table 3.<br>

The data presented in Table 3 shows that the examples outside the invention provide for opaque liquid cosmetic compositions. Examples relating to the invention provide for transparent liquid cosmetic compositions with a transparency similar to that of pure oils like coconut oil or paraffin.<br>
Spreadability<br>
Experiments were performed to determine the spreadabiiity of the transparent, storage stable liquid cosmetic compositions on hair fibres. 10 to 20 microlitres of coconut oil and the composition of Example 4 was brought in contact with a single strand of hair fibre, tied on to a microscope stage.<br>
The transferred oil film immediately formed pearl-like droplets on the hair fibre. Equilibrium contact angle of the droplets was measured on a Zeiss Microscope.<br>
Equilibrium contact angles for the pure coconut oil and Example 4 were found to be 20 and 10 degree respectively. Lower contact angle for the composition of the invention indicates its better spreadabiiity on hair fibre as compared to conventional hair oil.<br>
Thus the present invention provides for a transparent, storage stable liquid cosmetic composition comprising a large amount of water and oil and having better spreadabiiity. The compositions of the invention are suitable for use as hair oil and show attributes similar or superior to conventional hair oils.<br><br><br>
