				<td>The present invention relates to a group of unique diazabicycio alkane derivatives having<br>
interesting neurokinin-NKi receptor antagonistic activity. 5<br>
The invention also relates to a method for the preparation of the novel compounds, and to pharmaceutical compositions containing a pharmacologically active amount of at least one of these compounds as an active ingredient.<br>
From the European patent application EP 0655442 piperazine derivatives with neurokinin antagonistic activity are known. Novel piperazine derivatives sharing this biological activity were disclosed in EP 0899270 which describes a series of 2-(3-indolylmethyl)-1 -benzoyl-4-[(2-(benzylamino)ethyl)   aminocarbonyl)]   piperazine derivatives having N«! antagonistic activity.<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that piperazine derivatives are also NKT anta¬gonists when the piperazine ring and it"s N-4 substituent are fused to yield 1,4-diaza-bicyclo[4.3.0]nonane,   1,4-diazabicyclo[4.4.0]decane or   1,4-diazabicyclo-[4.5.0]undecane derivatives.<br>
The invention relates to compounds of the general formula (1)<br><br>
-R1      represents phenyl, 2-indolyl, 3-indolyl, 3-indazolyl or benzo[b]thiophen-3-yl, which groups may be substituted with halogen or alkyl (1-3C),<br>
-R2 and R3 independently represent halogen, H, OCH3, CH3 and CF3,<br><br>
-R4 R5and R6 independently represent H, OH, 0-alkyl(1-4C), CH2OH, NH2, dialkyl(1-3C)N, pyrrolidin-1-yl, piperidin-1-yl, morpholin-4-yl or morpholin-4-yl substituted witfi one or two methyl or methoxymethyl groups, nnorpholin-4-ylamino, morpholin-4-yimethyl, imidazol-l-yl, thiomorpholin-4-yl, 1,1-dioxo-<br>
tlnionnorpholin-4-yl or 3-oxa-8-azabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-8-yl; R4* and R5getlier<br>
may represent a keto, a 1,3-dioxan-2-yl or a 1,3-dioxolan-2-yl group,<br>
X	represents eitiier O or S,<br>
n	lias the value of 1, 2 or 3,<br>
a	is the asymmetrical carbon atom 8a, 9a or 10a when n equals 1, 2 or 3<br>
respectively,<br>
and pharmacologically acceptable salts thereof.<br>
All compounds having formula (1) in which the substituents on the asymmetrical 15 carbon atoms 3 and "a", as well as on the potentially asymetrical carbon atoms 6 and 7, are in either the R-configuration or the S-configuration belong to the invention.<br>
Also prodrugs, i.e. compounds which when administered to humans by any known route, are metabolised to compounds having formula (1), belong to the invention. In particular this relates to compounds in which R4, R5 or R6 represent a hydroxy or hydroxymethyl-group,   a   typical   example   being   3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl-[6-hydroxymethyl-3-(1H-indol-3-ylmethyl)-hexahydropyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrazin-2-yl]-methanone (compound 1 and it"s enantiomers, see below). Such compounds can be esterified to yield compounds which can be metabolized to compounds having formula (1).<br>
The invention particularly relates to compounds having formula (1) wherein R1 is 3-indolyl, R2 and R3 are CF3 groups in the 3 and 5 positions, X represents a keto group, n has the value of either 1 or 2, and "a", R"4, R5 and R6 have the meanings given 30     above, and including all possible stereo-isomers as outlined above.<br>
Even more preferred are compounds of the invention as described above, wherein R4 or R6 represents or contains either a morpholino or a hydroxymethyl group, R5 is hydrogen and which stereochemistry is 3R 35<br>
The compounds having formula (1) and their salts can be obtained according to at least one of the following methods known for compounds of this type.<br><br>
The compounds of the present invention in which n = 1 and R4 and R5 are hydrogen may be prepared by the general route outlined in Scheme 1.<br><br>
Thus the dicarboxylic acid diester I (prepared analogously to the method of G. Cignnarella, G. Nathansohn J. Org. Chem., 1961, 26, 1500) can be coupled to an appropriately protected amino acid under standard peptide coupling procedures as described in M. Bodanszky, A. Bodanszky The Practice of Peptide Syntfiesis, Springer-Verlag, 1994; ISBN: 0-387-57505-7, to afford amide II. The protective group in II (given in formula II as "PG") can be removed using known procedures (T.W. Greene, P.G.M, Wuts Protective groups in organic synthesis, 3rd ed., John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1999). Subsequent cyclisation gives the substituted diketopiperazine III, use of a chiral amino acid would result in the formation of diastereomers and these can be separated at this stage using standard chromatographic methods. Reduction of III with an active hydride reagent such as lithium aluminum hydride leads to an amino alcohol, which can be acylated with an appropriate acid chloride, under conditions that are generally known in the art, to afford IV. Conversion of the alcohol to an appropriate leaving group, such as a methanesulfonate, and subsequent reaction<br><br>
with an amine affords compounds V. Details of compounds synthesized by this route are given in example 1, below.<br>
Ester prodrugs of compounds IV could be obtained by acylation with acid chlorides in a solvent such as acetonitrile in the presence of a base such as dlisopropylethyl-amine, at temperatures between 20°C and 80""C (see example 6, below).<br>
The compounds of the invention in which n = 1 and R6 = H may be prepared by the general route outlined in Scheme 2. Thus reaction of an amino acid ester with an appropriately protected 4-hydroxyproline derivative under standard peptide coupling procedures as described in M. Bodanszky, A. Bodanszky The Practice of Peptide Synttiesis, Springer-Verlag, 1994; ISBN: 0-387-57505-7 afforded dipeptide VI. The protective group in VI can be removed using known procedures (T.W. Greene, P.G.M. Wuts Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3"" ed., John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1999). Subsequent cyclisation affords the substituted diketopiperazine VII, this reaction may be realized by stirring in a mixture of acetonitrile and piperidlne. Protection of the hydroxygroup of VII as a silyl ether, by standard methods such as those described in T.W. Greene, P.G.M. Wuts Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1999, and subsequent reduction with an active hydride reagent such as lithium aluminum hydride leads to amino alcohols like VIII. Compounds of formula VIII can be acylated with an appropriate acid chloride, under standard conditions, to afford IX. Conversion of the alcohol to an appropriate leaving group, such as a methanesulfonate, and subsequent reaction with an amine affords compounds X. Details of compounds synthesized by this route are given in example 2, below.<br><br><br>
The compounds of the present invention in which n = 2 and R6 = H may be prepared by the general route outlined in Scheme 3. Thus reaction of an amino acid ester with 5-oxo-piperidine-1,2-dicarboxylic acid 1-benzyl ester (H.C. Beyerman, P. Boekee f?ee/. Trav. Chim. Pays-Bas, 1959, 78, 648) under standard peptide coupling 5 procedures as described in M. Bodanszky, A. Bodanszky The Practice of Peptide Syntfiesis, Springer-Verlag, 1994; ISBN: 0-387-57505-7 afforded dipeptides XI, use of a chiral amino acid would result in the formation of diastereomers and these can be separated at this (or a later) stage using standard chromatographic methods. Protection of the ketone in XI as a cyclic or acyclic ketal, such as those described in<br>
T.W. Greene, P.G.M. Wuts Protective Groups in Organic Synttiesis, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1999, yields compounds of formula XII, in which A and B represent a cyclic or acyclic ketal. This reaction can be conducted following conventional methods that are generally known in the art. Removal of the benzyloxycarbonyl group under reductive conditions (H2, Pd/C) in a solvent such as methanol, followed by acid catalyzed cyclisation afforded diketopiperazines of formula XIII. Reduction of XIII with an active hydride reagent such as lithium aluminum hydride leads to an amine, which can be acylated with an appropriate acid chloride, under conditions that are generally known in the art, to afford XIV. Hydrolysis of the ketal to form XV can be done by methods as described in T.W. Greene, P.G.M. Wuts Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1999. Reductive amination of XV with a suitable amine, in a solvent such   as   1,2-dichloroethane,   with   a   reducing   agent such   as   sodium triacetoxyborohydride, affords compounds of the formula XVI. Alternatively XVI can be prepared from XV by reduction of the ketone with a reducing agent such as sodium triacetoxyborohydride in a solvent such as acetic acid to the alcohol XVII. The alcohol can be transformed into a leaving group (L) such as chloro, bromo, or methanesulfonate, under conditions generally known in the art, to give XVIII. Substitution of the leaving group in XVIII with a suitable amine, in a solvent such as acetonitrile affords compounds of formula XVI. Details of compounds synthesized by this route are given in examples 3, 4 and 5, below.<br><br><br>
Intermediates VIII (scheme 2), XIII (scheme 3) and XVIII (scheme 3) are novel compounds. The invention also relates to these novel compounds.<br>
Suitable acid addition salts can be formed with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid and nitric acid, or with organic acids such as citric acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, tartaric acid, acetic acid, trifluoro acetic acid, benzoic acid, p-toluene sulphonic acid, methanesulphonic acid and naphthalene sulphonic acid.<br>
The compounds of the invention of the general formula (1), as well as the salts thereof, have NKi antagonistic activity and show a good bioavailability. They are useful in the treatment of disorders in which neurokinins which interact with NKi receptors, e.g. neurokinin-1 (= Substance P) are involved, or that can be treated via manipulation of those systems. For instance in acute and chronic pain, emesis,<br><br>
inflammatory diseases such as meningitis, arthritis, asthma, psoriasis and (sun)burns; gastro-intestinal disorders, in particular irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn"s disease), ulcerative colitis; bladder or Gl tract hypermotility disorders, urinary tract inflammation; allergic responses such as 5 eczema and rhinitis; cardio¬vascular disorders such as hypertension, atherosclerosis, edema, angina, cluster headache and migraine; cutaneous diseases such as urticaria, lupus erythematosus and pruritus; respiratory disorders including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchospams, bronchopneumonia, bronchitis, respiratory distress syndrome and cystic fibrosis; various neoplastic diseases;<br>
psychiatric and/or neurological disorders such as schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders; mood disorders such as bipolar I disorders, bipolar II disorders and unipolar depressive disorders like minor depression, seasonal affective disorder, postnatal depression dysthymia and major depression; anxiety disorders including panic disorder (with or without agoraphobia), social phobia, obsessive compulsive disorder (with or without co-morbid chronic tic or schizotypal disorder), posttraumatic stress disorder and generalized anxiety disorder; substance related disorders, including substance use disorders (like dependence and abuse) and substance induced disorders (like substance withdrawal); pervasive development disorders including autistic disorder and Rett"s disorder; attention deficit and disruptive behavior disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; impulse control disorders like agression, pathological gambling; eating disorders like anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, obesity; sleep disorders like insomnia; tic disorders like Tourette"s disorder; restless legs syndrome; disorders characterized by impairment of cognition and memory such as Alzheimer"s disease, Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease, Huntington"s disease, Parkinson"s disease and neurorehabilitation (post-traumatic brain lesions)<br>
The NK1 antagonistic properties of the compounds of the invention were tested using the methods outlined below. 30<br>
Pharmacological Methods<br>
Receptor Binding for human NKi Receptors<br>
Affinity of the compounds for human NKi receptors was assessed using radio¬receptor binding assays. Membrane preparations were prepared from Chinese Hamster Ovarium fibroblast (CHO) cells in which the human NKT receptor was stably expressed. Membranes were incubated with [3H]-substance P in the absence or the<br><br>
presence of specified concentrations of the compounds, diluted in a suitable buffer in presence of peptidase inhibitor for 10 min at 25°C. Separation of bound radioactivity from free was done by filtration over Whatman GF/B glass fiber filters with two 5 sec washings. Bound radioactivity was counted by liquid scintillation counting using a 5 Betaplate counter. Measured radioactivity was plotted against the concentration of the displacing test compound and displacement curves were calculated by four-parameter logistic regression, resulting in IC50 values, i.e. that concentration of displacing compound by which 50% of the radioligand is displaced. Affinity pK, values were calculated by correcting the IC50 values for radioligand concentration and its 10 affinity for the human NKT receptor according to the Cheng-Prusoff equation:<br>
pKi=-log[IC5o/(1+S/Kd)]<br>
in which the IC50 is as described above, S is the concentration [3H]-substance P used 15     in the assay expressed in mol/l, and Kd is the equilibrium dissociation constant of [3H]-substance P for human NKT receptors (in mol/l).<br>
cAMP measurements<br>
The effects of test compounds at formation of cyclic AMP (cAMP) was assessed<br>
using CHO fibroblast cells, stably expressing cloned human NKT receptors. In addition to coupling to phospholipase C, human NKT receptors are also able to stimulate adenylate cyclase, which converts ATP into cAMP. For tests, cells were cultured in 24-well plates. Prior to experiments, medium was replaced by serum-free oc-DMEM culture medium, containing f H]-adenine which is taken up by the cells and<br>
converted sequentially into radiolabeled adenosine, AMP, ADP and ultimately into radiolabeled ATP. After 2 hrs, cells were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) in presence of 1 mM isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX; inhibitor of phospho¬diesterases that hydrolyse cAMP into AMP). Subsequently, cells were stimulated by 10 nM substance P in absence or presence of test compounds in appropriate<br>
dilutions in PBS/IBMX for 20 min. After stimulation, medium was aspirated and cells were extracted by 5% trichloroacetic acid. Radiolabeled ATP and cAMP were recovered from the extracts using sequential column chromatography. Extracts were separated by ion-exchange chromatography over DOWEX 50WX4 columns, allowing the recovery of ATP. Columns were subsequently put on top of aluminum oxide<br>
columns and eluted with water. Recovery of cAMP was performed by eluting the aluminum oxide columns with 100 mM imidazole (pH 7.4). Both ATP and cAMP<br><br>
fractions were counted for radioactivity using liquid scintillation counting and conversion ratios were calculated as:<br>
v = [cAMP] * 100% / ([ATP] + [cAMP]). Concentration-response relationships were constructed by plotting cAMP conversion against compound concentration and IC50 values were calculated by four-parameter logistic regression. Antagonist potencies (pAa) values were calculated using:<br>
PA2=IC50/(1+[SP]/EC50)<br>
in which the IC50 of the test compound was obtained from concentration-effect relationships, [SP] is the concentration of substance P (in mol/l; typically 10 nM), and the EC50 is the potency of substance P at human cloned NKT receptors.<br>
NKi agonist -induced gerbil Foot-Tapping<br>
The ability of NIC, antagonists to antagonise foot-tapping induced by centrally administered NKI agonists has been demonstrated (Rupniak and Williams, 1994 (Eur. J. Pharmacol. 265:179); Bristow and Young, 1994 (Eur. J. Pharmacol. 254: 245)). Therefore, we have used this model to assess the in vivo activity of the compounds of the invention.<br>
60 min prior to anaesthesia with N2O (0.8L/min), halothane (3%) and O2 (0.8 L/min) male gerbils (40-60 g; Charles River) received an injection of vehicle or test compound (p.o.). Upon successful narcosis the anaesthetic was adjusted to N2O (0.6L/min), halothane (1.5%) and O2 (0.6 L/min) and a midline scalp incision made. GR 73632 was infused into the cerebroventricular space (AP - 0.5mm, L -1.2 mm, and vertical -4.5mm from bregma). Following recovery from anaesthesia (about 3-4 min) the foot tapping response was recorded for 5 minutes. The predefined criterion for antagonism of this response was defined as inhibition of foot tapping for &gt; 5 min.<br>
The compounds of the invention have a high affinity for NKT receptors with pKrValues &gt; 7.0 in the binding assay described above. The compounds of the invention are also active in the cAMP assay, their pA2-values being in line with their pKrValues. Some 35 of the compounds belonging to the invention penetrate the blood brain barrier as is evident from their activity in the neurokinin-agonist induced gerbil foot tapping assay. This property makes them useful in the treatment of CNS disorders.<br><br>
The invention is further illustrated by means of the following specific examples.<br>
Example 1 (see scheme 1)<br>
Step 1: To a mixture of fra/7s-pyrrolidine-2,5-dicarboxylic acid diethyl ester hydrochloride (4.2 g) and A"^-carbobenzyloxy-D-tryptophan (10.0 g) in acetonitrile (200 mL) was added 1,3-diisopropylcarbodiimide (2.6 mL) and subsequently 4-dimethylaminopyridine (-20 mg). The resulting mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature, then diisopropylethylamine (2.5 mL) was added and stirring was continued for another day. The reaction was quenched with NaOH (aq, 2N) and extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was dried (Na2S04), filtered, and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified by flash chromatography (SiOa, MTBE) to afford a mixture of {2R,5R,2"R) and (2S,5S,2"R) 1-[2-benzyloxycarbonyl-amino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propionyl]-pyrrolidine-2,5-dicarboxylic acid diethyl ester (8.25 g, 90%). R, 0.62 (EtOAc) (Intermediates 1 and 2).<br>
Step 2: A mixture of {2R,5R,2"R) and (2S,5S,2"R) 1-[2-benzyloxycarbonylamino-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)-propionyl]-pyrrolidine-2,5-dicarboxylic acid diethyl ester (8.5 g), palladium on carbon (10%, -250 mg), and ethanol (250 mL) was hydrogenated with<br>
H2 (1 atm.) overnight. The catalyst was removed by filtration over Celite and the remaining solution was concentrated in vacuo. The resulting two diastereomers could be separated by flash chromatography (SiOa, CH2CI2/MeOH/NH40H 95:4.5:0.5) to afford (3f?,6S,8aS)-3-(1 H-lndol-3-ylmethyl)-1,4-dioxo-octahydro-pyrrolo[1,2-a]pyra-zine-6-carboxylic acid ethyl ester (2.3 g) and (3R,6R,8aR)-3-(1H-lndol-3-ylmethyl)-<br>
1,4-dioxo-octahydro-pyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrazine-6-carboxylic acid ethyl ester (1.75 g) (Intermediates 3 and 4).<br>
Step 3: To a suspension of lithium aluminium hydride (1.2 g) in THF (50 mL) was added    a    solution    of   (3f?,6R,8aft)-3-(1H-lndol-3-ylmethyl)-1,4-dioxo-octahydro-<br>
pyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrazine-6-carboxylic acid ethyl ester (1.75 g) in THF (50 mL). The resulting mixture was heated under reflux for 3 hours, then a mixture of water (3 mL) and THF (30 mL) was added drop-wise followed by 50% sodium hydroxide (aq, 0.5 mL), and heating under reflux was continued for 2 hours. After cooling to room temperature diisopropylethylamine    (4    mL)   and   3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)benzoyl<br>
chloride (2.4 mL) were added and stirring was continued overnight. Ethyl acetate was added and the mixture extracted with sodium bicarbonate (5% aq. soln.). The organic layer was dried (Na2S04), filtered, and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was<br><br>
purified by flash chromatography (SiOz, CH2Cl2/MeOH/NH40H 95:4.5:0.5) to afford 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl-[(3f?,6R,8aR)-6-hydroxymethyl-3-(1H-indol-3-ylmethyl)-hexahydropyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrazin-2-yl]-methanone (1,49 g). MH* 526; Rf 0.20 (EtOAc) (compound 1). 5<br>
Step 4: A mixture of (3,5-bls(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-[(3R,6R,8aR)-6-hydroxymethyl-3-(1 H-<br>
indol-3-ylmethyl)-hexahydropyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrazin-2-yl]-methanone	(1.30	g),<br>
