AMINE COMPOUNDS AND CURABLE COMPOSITIONS DERIVED THEREFROM<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION The present invention relates generally to amine compounds that find particular use in the sol-gel preparation of curable, high abrasion-resistant coating compositions. The present invention further relates to methods of making such amine compounds, curable compositions comprising the amine compounds, methods of curing such compositions and the cured products derived therefrom.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
High abrasion-resistant coating compositions find use in a wide variety of coatings applications. Because such compositions form coatings which tend to . increase the hardness and abrasion resistance of substrates, they are desirable for use in protecting the surfaces of said substrates. For example, high abrasion resistant coating compositions are used in the manufacture of transparent articles, including building windows, aircraft windows, eyeglasses, and lenses, to prevent dulling, pitting and scratching of the surfaces thereon. Additionally, high abrasion resistant coating compositions are used to help metal substrates, such as those made from aluminum, maintain physical and structural qualities.<br><br>
A useful class of such high abrasion resistant coating compositions are those derived via sol-gel procedures. Traditionally, such coating compositions have been produced by reacting one or more inorganic alkoxysilane compounds to form a curable composition comprising a network of siloxane bonded (-Si-O-Si-) moieties.<br>
More recently, alkoxysilated amine compounds have been used in conjunction with inorganic compounds to form high abrasion resistant coating compositions via sol-gel procedures. For example, U.S. Patent Nos. 5,316,855 and 5,371,261, issued to Wilkes et al, disclose the use of alkoxysilylated organic compounds containing urea (-NH-C(O)-NH-) and/or urethane (-NH-C(O)-O-) bonds in the preparation of sol-gel derived curable compositions. Such organic compositions are reacted with metal alkoxide or semi-metal alkoxide compounds to form curable compositions.<br>
The present inventors have discovered that the use of organic compounds containing urea (-NH-C(O)-NH-) and/or urethane (-NH-C(O)-O-) bonds in curable compositions is disadvantageous for several reasons. For example, one disadvantage is that organic compounds containing urea and urethane moieties are susceptible to hydrolysis. The hydrolysis of such compounds in the water-alcohol borne sol-gel compositions leads to "dangling" side groups, which lowers the abrasion resistance of the resulting coatings. In addition, the hydrolysis raises the pH of such compositions which, in turn, shortens gelling time and reduces the shelf life of the compositions.<br><br>
Recognizing these and other drawbacks of the prior art, the present inventors have perceived a need for new, stable alkoxysilated organic compouds for use in a variety of applications, especially sol-gel coatings applications. These and other objects are achieved by the present invention as described below.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to a family of alkoxysilated amine compounds which find particular use in the preparation of coating compositions, especially those formed via sol-gel techniques, for use in various coatings applications. The amine compounds of the present invention overcome the disadvantages of the prior art by incorporating hydrolytically stable moieties which, when forming curable compositions, can be more readily exposed to water without risk of reduced shelf life. Moreover, the amine compounds of the present invention can be used to prepare curable compositions and coatings/films having longer shelf lives and greater abrasion resistance than those of the prior art.<br>
According to one aspect of the present invention, provided are compounds produced by a process comprising the step of reacting an amine reactant with an epoxide reactant to form a hydrolytically stable carbon-nitrogen bond therebetween, wherein at least one of the amine or epoxide reactants comprises a terminal alkoxysiyl group. In preferred embodiments, the compounds provided by the present invention are compounds described by the formula 1 below.<br><br><br>

a,	c, e, f h, j, 1 and p are independently 0 or 1;<br>

Accordingly, the curable compositions of the present invention comprise at least one amine produced by a process comprising the step of reacting an amine reactant with an epoxide reactant to form a hydrolytically stable carbon-nitrogen bond therebetween. In preferred embodiments, the curable compositions of the present invention comprise at least one amine compound of formula (1).<br>
The curable compositions of the present invention are useful in the manufacture of abrasion-resistant coatings. Therefore, yet another aspect of the present invention is a method for producing a substrate having an abrasion-resistant coating comprising the steps of:<br>
(a) applying a layer of the curable composition of the invention onto a substrate; and (b) curing the curable composition on the substrate.<br><br>
The inventive method produces articles of manufacture having abrasion-resistant coatings. Therefore, still another aspect of the-present invention is a substrate having an abrasion-resistant coating produced via the method of the present invention.<br>
The curable compositions comprising amine compounds of the present invention may be cured to form films. Therefore, the present invention also includes the films produced by curing the curable compositions comprising at least one amine compound .of the present invention.<br>

Examples of suitable secondary amine functional silane compounds include 3-(N-methylamino)propyltrimethoxysilane, 3-(N-ethylamino)propyltrimethoxysilane, and the like. Such compounds are generally available commercially (for example,3-(N-methylamino)propyltrimethoxysilane and 3-(N-ethylamino)propyItrimethoxysilane from Gelest Inc.) and many of such compounds are known in the literature and are obtainable by art-recognized procedures.<br>

Furthermore, the amount of reagents used is preferably an amount effective to achieve a greater than about 50%, preferably greater than 70%, and more preferably at least about 90% conversion of the amine starting material to desired product. For example, in certain preferred processes in which<br><br>
the epoxide-containing compound is triphenylolmethyl triglycidyl ether (3 epoxy groups per molecule) and the secondary amine functional silane is 3-(N-methyIamino)propyltriethoxy5ilane (one -NH per molecule), the mole ratio of 3-(N-methylamino)propyltriethoxysilane to triphenylolmethyl triglycidyl ether is preferably from about 2:1 to about 3:1, more preferably from about 2.5:1 to abou 3:1, and even more preferably from about 2.8:1 to about 2.9:1.<br>
In addition to the amine functional silane and epoxy compounds, the reaction mixture preferably includes a suitable lower alcohol solvent. Examples of suitable lower alcohol solvents are methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, and the like. In preferred embodiments of the present invention, the solvent is ethanol. The amount of alcohol solvent used is preferably greater than about 30wt% by weight of the reaction mixture. For most applications, a 50wt% ethanol solvent is effective in prohibiting undesirable system gelati6n. Accordingly, in especially preferred embodiments, the reaction mixture of the present invention comprises at least about 50wt% ethanol.<br>
Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the conditions under which the reaction occurs, including the temperature, pressure and period of reaction, will depend on numerous factors, including the particular starting reagents used and the desired reaction yield.

For such embodiments, the reaction pressure is preferably from about 1 atmosphere(atm) to about 10 atm, more preferably from about 1 atm to about 2 atm, and even more preferably from about 1 atm to about 1.2 atm. Also, for such embodiments, the reaction time is preferably from about 1 to about 20 days depending on the reaction temperature.

Any suitable amounts of present amine compounds, alkyltrialkoxysilanes and tetraalkoxysilanes can be used in the practice of the present invention. Those of skill in the art will be readily able to determine the amounts of compounds to be used for various applications according to the present invention. Generally, the present amine<br><br>
comprises from about 0.5 to about 40 weight % of the compostion. Preferably, the amine comprises from about 2 to about 30 weight % of the compostion, and more preferably 6 to about 20weight %. Generally, the tetraalkoxysilane comprises from about 0 to about 40 weight % of the compostion, preferably, from about 5 to about 30 weight % of the compostion, and more preferably 10 to about 30 weight %. Furthermore, the alkyltrialkoxysilane comprises from about 0 to about 40 weight % of the compostion, preferably, from about 2 to about 30 weight % of the compostion, and more preferably 5 to about 20 weight %.<br>
The curable compositions of the present invention may further comprise other compounds used traditionally in sol-gel curable compositions including water, lower alcohol solvents, and/or acid or base catalysts. Suitable lower alcohols for use in the present invention include Cx-C5 alcohols, such as, for example, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, 2-methoxyethanol, 2-ethoxyethanol, methoxy-2-propanol, and the like. Preferred lower alcohols include ethanol and methoxy-2-propanol. Suitable acid catalysts include a number of volatile strong acids, such as, for example, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, and the like. In preferred embodiments the acid catalyst comprises hydrochloric acid. Suitable bases include, for example, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, and the like. In certain preferred embodiments, the amount of base added is a relatively small, preferably trace, amount. Additionally, in certain embodiments of the present invention, the amine moiety of the present amine<br><br>
compounds acts as a base catalyst in the curable compositions of the present invention.<br>
Those of skill in the art will be readily able to determine the amounts of water and lower alcohol for use in various applications of the present invention. Generally, the amount of alcohol used in compositions of the present invention is from about 5 to about 50 weight% of the composition, preferably, from about 10 to about 50 weight%, and even more preferably, from about 25 to about 40 weight %. The amount of water used is generally from about 1 to about 50 weight % of the composition, preferably, from about 5 to about 40 weight %, and even more preferably, from about 20 to about 35 weight%. Furthermore, after hydrolysis and condensation, the overall solids concentration of the compositions are from about 5 wt% to about 50 wt%, preferably from about 15 wt% to about 30 wt %, and even more preferably from about 18 wt% to about 25 wt%.<br>
The curable compositions of the present invention may further comprise other additives or compounds used traditionally in sol-gel curable compositions including: UV stabilizers and surfactants (for use, for example, as flow controlling agents). For example, the use of UV stabilizers and the use of polysiloxane-polyether surfactants in sol-gel preparations are described in U.S. Patent No. 6,072,018 and U.S. Patent No. 4,277,287, respectively, incorporated herein by reference.<br>
According to certain preferred embodiments, the curable compositions of the present invention are prepared via sol-gel hydrolysis and co-hydrolysis reactions of<br><br>
the present amine compound and other optional alkoxysilyl or hydroxysilyl group-containing compounds. Procedures for sol-gel hydrolysis and co-hydrolysis reactions are known and involve, generally, reacting in a solvent, under acidic or basic conditions, compounds having alkoxysilyl or hydroxysilyl groups to form siloxane (-Si-O-Si-) bonds via silanol-silanol or silanol-alkoxysilane condensations.<br>
While those of skill in the art will be readily able to adapt known sol-gel procedures for use in the present invention, applicants have discovered that curable compositions formed according to certain preferred embodiments of the present invention, wherein the composition comprises at least one present amine compound, at least one alkyltrialkoxysilane and at least one tetraalkoxysilane, have a surprisingly enhanced shelf life when the amine and tetraalkoxysilane are co-hydrolyzed in a first step, followed by co-hydrolysis of the alkyltrialkoxysilane compound with the pre-hydrolyzed present amine and tetraalkoxysilane mixture. In such preferred embodiments, the first step is performed under either acidic or basic conditions. The first step of the hydrolysis may be performed under acidic conditions by adding an amount of acid greater than the amount necessary to neutralize all of the amine groups present in the composition from the present amine compounds. If no acid, or an amount of acid insufficient to neutralize of the amine groups present in the composition, is used, the first step of the hydrolysis may occur under basic conditions.<br><br>
The second step is performed subsequently by adding the alkyltrialkoxysilane compound to the hydrolyzed mixture with sufficient acid to bring thexeaction pH to from about 1 to about 6 and preferably from about 3 to about 5. Although applicants do not wish to be bound by or to any theory of operation, it is believed that within the pH range of 3-5, the amine groups of the present amine compounds are mostly protonated by the acid to form ammonium ions. The ammonium ions tend to deter silanol or alkoxysilane groups in the same or adjacent clusters from approaching each other and collapsing into dense particles. The ammonium ions further deter excessive cluster growth which may lead to premature and undesirable system gelation. Upon heating during the curing process, the ammonium ions are converted back to amine groups thus catalyzing further silanol-silanol and silanol-alkoxysilane condensations.<br>
It is further believed that the presence of the tetralkoxysilane and alkyltrialkoxysilane components may slow gelation of present compositions. Such components tend to react with the relatively large present amine compounds first to form compound clusters having silanol/alkoxysilane groups which have lower reactivity in acidic medium. As a result, the probability of reaction between two compound clusters decreases.<br>
Coating applications<br>
The compositions of the present invention are useful in a number of applications, such as, for example, high technology areas as instrument panels, optical<br><br>
devices and equipment, coatings, laminates, films and glazing materials. Coatings derived from compounds of the present invention may be applied, for example, to nonporous continuous substrates, such as those of plastics, paints, metals and the like; polymer substrates, including, but not limited to, those comprising bisphenol-A polycarbonate, polymethylmethacrylate), poly(diethylene glycol diallylcarbonate), and the like; metal substrates comprising, for example, aluminum, copper, brass, stainless steel and the like; as well as other substrates, tojmpart to them improved abrasion resistance or resistance against damage in corrosive environments. In certain preferred embodiments of the present invention, the compositions of the present invention may be used as glazing materials for building windows, automobiles, trains, and airplanes, as well as, polymeric prisms and lenses for optical instruments and eyeglasses.<br>
As mentioned above, other aspects of the present invention provide a process for producing a coated substrate and the coated substrate derived therefrom. Generally, the method involves applying the curable composition of the invention onto a substrate and curing the curable composition on the substrate.<br>

in certain preferred embodiments, it is desirable to clean the substrate prior to the coating step to avoid the incorporation of impurities" intoiJie coating layer and at the substrate/coating interface. Any of a "wide range of cleaning materials can be used to clean the substrate according to the present invention. For example, metal surfaces may be cleaned using liquids, such as acetone, 2-propanoI and the like, or may be polished or sanded. Polymeric substrates may be cleaned using degreasing liquids such as 2-propanol and the like.<br>
Additionally, according to certain preferred embodiments, adhesion-promoting substances may be applied to the substrate to promote better adhesion between the substrate and the coating material. For example, primers such as 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane and the like may be used. The substrate may also be pretreated via plasma treatment processes, known in the art, to enhance the adhesion of the coating to the substrate.<br>
In certain preferred embodiments, the curable composition is cured by exposing the composition to heat. As will be readily appreciated, the composition may be cured using an oven or by exposure to another heat source. While the preferred embodiment involves heat-curing the curable composition, one skilled in the art will appreciate that many variations of the method within the scope of the claims is possible depending on the nature of the curable composition. For example, if desired, the curing of the curable composition may be accelerated using microwave treatment procedures known in the art.<br><br>
The present invention also provides for a coating or film formed by curing a curable composition of the present invention.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
In order that the invention may be more readily understood, reference is made to the following examples which are intended to be illustrative of the invention, but are not intended to be limiting in scope.<br>
In the following Examples, the abrasion ruuouuiww ux mc ratings is evaluated using two types of Taber tests. The first is a 1000-cycle Taber test (ASTM D 4060) involving a pair of CS10F wheels, 500 g load per wheel. Square substrates (4 in x 4 in x 1/16 in) of bisphenol-A polycarbonate are used as substrates for the tests. The haze (ASTMD 1044 and ASTMD 1003) increase of the substrate after the Taber test is used as an index for the abrasion resistance of the coating.<br>
The second type of Taber test involves 500 cycles of abrasion using a pair of CS10 wheels (a harsher type than CS10F), 500g load per wheel. In this test, both the haze and transparency of the wear track with respect to the unabraded regions are used as indices for abrasion resistance. The transparency is measured using a Shimadzu CS-9000 UV-VIS scanner by scanning a 420 nm light beam (0.1x10 mm2 in size) across the wear track. The difference of the absorbance between the wear track and unabraded regions is measured and then converted to the transparency value.<br><br>
Example 1<br>
