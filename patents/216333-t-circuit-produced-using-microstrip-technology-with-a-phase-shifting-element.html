				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to T-circuits<br>
produced using microstrip technology and comprising a<br>
phase-shifting element that gives a given phase shift,<br>
the T-circuit operating in broadband.<br>
The present invention applies in particular to<br>
the field of broadband antenna networks. In this type<br>
of network, the width of the frequency band is often<br>
limited by the bandwidth of the elemental radiating<br>
element and by the bandwidth of the supply network.<br>
This is particularly the case when use is made of a<br>
phase shift in the excitation of the radiating<br>
elements. This type of phase shift is used in<br>
particular when the radiating elements produced, for<br>
example using printed technology, are excited using the<br>
well-known technique of sequential rotation. For<br>
networks of radiating elements of the above type, the<br>
supply network is usually produced using microstrip<br>
technology and consists of at least one T-circuit<br>
connected via microstrip lines and elbows to the<br>
various radiating elements. The supply network thus<br>
distributes the energy to each of the radiating<br>
elements. In order for these radiating elements to be<br>
excited with the desired phase, bits of line are added<br>
on one side of the T-circuit or circuits. However, this<br>
phase shift is valid only for a narrow frequency band.<br>
The behaviour of the microstrip lines of the<br>
T-circuits and of the elbows is actually well known to<br>
those skilled in the art and provides an explanation<br>
for the operation over a narrow frequency band.<br>
In the case of microstrip lines, a length of<br>
microstrip line introduces a phase shift = bL where L<br>
is equal to the length of the line and b is the phase<br>
constant. In a known way, b depends on the substrate,<br>
on the frequency and on the width of the microstrip<br>
line. Its value is given by:<br>
b = 2p/?g<br>
where ?g = ?0/vereff,<br>
?g being the guided wavelength.<br>
In this formula, er is the effective dielectric<br>
constant and depends on the width of the line, on the<br>
height of the substrate on which the line is produced, ,<br>
on the thickness of the metallization, on the<br>
dielectric constant of the substrate and on the<br>
wavelength, and ?0 is the wavelength in a vacuum<br>
(associated with the frequency). This therefore<br>
explains why the lines do not have the same phase for<br>
different frequencies.<br>
As is known, a T-circuit like the one depicted<br>
in Figure 1, has equivalent line lengths between port 1<br>
and port 2 and between port 1 and port 3. As a result,<br>
the value Ang(S21) - Ang(S31) = 0, irrespective of the<br>
working frequency.<br>
In addition, in a supply network produced using<br>
microstrip technology, use is also made of elbowed<br>
lines which, among other things, allow for changes in<br>
direction so that energy can be supplied to the<br>
radiating element. In terms of phase shift, it is<br>
possible to find a length of elbow equivalent to the<br>
length of a line. Thus, the phase shift of an elbow is<br>
equal to = belbow x Lelbow,<br>
where belbow is the phase constant in the elbow<br>
and<br>
Lelbow is the electrical length in the elbow.<br>
As depicted in Figure 2, T-circuits comprising<br>
a phase-shifting element have already been produced in<br>
the prior art. These circuits are based on the<br>
principle of a T-circuit with lines of identical length<br>
L2 on each side of the exit from the T and followed by<br>
elbowed lines comprising bits of line L1 of identical<br>
length. The circuit will display a phase difference<br>
Ang(S31) - Ang(S21) = 0, regardless of the frequency,<br>
if the length of the lines between port 1 and port 2<br>
and between port 1 and port 3 is the same. As a result,<br>
in order to introduce a phase shift of a given value,<br>
for example of 180°, between the exit ports 2 and 3,<br>
all that is required is for one of the lines to be<br>
lengthened by a length L such that bL = 180°. This can<br>
be done using bits of line on each side of an elbow, of<br>
a length such that = 180° and -1 this representation is centry to that provided in fig.2= 0°, as depicted<br>
in Figure 2. However, all of the simulations carried<br>
out on such a T-circuit show that this condition is<br>
valid only for the central frequency and that the phase<br>
shift of 180° is no longer obtained when this central<br>
frequency is departed from.<br>
Thus, the object of the present invention is<br>
therefore to propose a T-circuit produced using<br>
microstrip technology comprising a phase-shifting<br>
element such that the T-circuit can operate over a<br>
large frequency band.<br>
In consequence, a subject of the present<br>
invention is a T-circuit produced using microstrip<br>
technology with two branches of identical length L2<br>
comprising a phase-shifting element producing a given<br>
phase shift by extending one of the branches, the<br>
T-circuit operating in broadband, characterized in that<br>
it comprises at least one elbow extending the branch<br>
without the phase-shifting element and in that the<br>
length L2 is equal to a multiple of ?g/2 where ?g is<br>
the guided wavelength.<br>
In this case, the phase-shifting element is<br>
formed by a microstrip line of length L = /b where b<br>
is the phase constant, b being calculated as mentioned<br>
hereinabove. As a preference, the phase-shifting<br>
element is extended by a line element of length<br>
L"1 = L1 + Lelbow and the elbow is extended by a line<br>
element of length L1, these elements for example<br>
allowing connection to radiating elements.<br>
According to another feature of the present<br>
invention, the phase-shifting element is formed of an<br>
elbow of a length such that a phase shift of /2 is<br>
distributed on each side of the elbow. In this case,<br>
each elbow is extended by a line element of identical<br>
length L1 for connection, for example, to a radiating<br>
element.<br>
The present invention also relates to a supply<br>
circuit for a broadband antenna network produced using<br>
microstrip technology, characterized in that it<br>
comprises at least one T-circuit exhibiting the<br>
characteristics described hereinabove.<br>
Other characteristics and advantages of the<br>
present invention will become apparent upon reading<br>

In the figures, the same elements carry the<br>
same references.<br>
A first embodiment of a T-circuit with a<br>
phase-shifting element according to the present<br>
invention will be described first of all with reference<br>
to Figures 3 to 6.<br>
As depicted in Figure 3, the T-circuit with a<br>
phase-shifting element comprises, in this instance,<br>
just one elbow. More specifically, the T-circuit<br>
consists of a branch 1 comprising an entry port P1 and<br>
two perpendicular branches 2, 3 of the same length L2.<br>
According to the present invention, the length L2 is<br>
chosen so that it is a multiple of ?g/2 where ?g is<br>
equal to the guided wavelength in the branches produced<br>
using microstrip technology.<br>
As depicted in Figure 3, the branch 3 is<br>
extended by an elbow 4 which itself is extended by a<br>
line element 5 of length L1 to reach the exit port P2.<br>
On the other hand, the other branch 2, according to the<br>
present invention, is extended by a line element 6<br>
giving a phase shift of O, then by a line element 7 of<br>
length L1 + Lelbow so as to arrive at the port P3. Line<br>
element 6 has a length L" such that L" = /b. In the<br>
embodiment depicted in Figure 3, according to the<br>
present invention, the elbow 4 is placed on the side of<br>
the shortest arm and the length L2 has to be a multiple<br>
of ?g/2.<br>
The advantages of such a structure will become<br>
apparent following simulations carried out using<br>
commercially available software such as IE3D or<br>
HPESSOF, these simulation results being depicted in<br>
Figures 4, 5 and 6. These simulations were carried out<br>
by producing the T-circuit with a phase-shifting<br>
element on a Rogers 4003 substrate having an er of 3.38,<br>
a height equal to 0.81 mm, a tangent ? of 0.0022 and<br>
T = 17.5 micrometres. In this case, the width of the<br>
50 ohm line used for the simulations was W = 1.5 mm.<br>
A T-circuit with a phase-shifting element with<br>
one elbow, in which the variation in the phase shift of<br>
the T with the phase-shifting element with one elbow is<br>
compared with a line of length L such that bL = 180°,<br>
is depicted in Figure 4. In this case, it can be seen<br>
that the variation in phase is equal to 23° rather than<br>
30° over a bandwidth of between 11 and 13 GHz.<br>
Figures 5 and 6 depict the variation in phase<br>
shift of a phase-shifting T with one elbow designed<br>
according to other rules. Thus, in Figure 5, the elbow<br>
is not placed on the same side as the arm 3, as<br>
depicted in Figure 3, but in place of the line<br>
element , the branch 3 being extended by a line<br>
element of the type of the element 7. In this case, it<br>
can be seen that the phase shift of the T-circuit is<br>
more or less identical to that of the line at 180°.<br>
Figure 6 depicts the case of a T-circuit with a<br>
phase-shifting element with one elbow in which the<br>
length of each branch L2 is other than ?g/2. The<br>
results of the simulation show that the variation in<br>
phase shift with frequency exceeds the phase shift of a<br>
line of length 180°.<br>
Another embodiment of a T-circuit with a<br>
phase-shifting element according to the present<br>
invention will now be described with reference to<br>
Figures 7, 8, 9 and 10. In this case, as depicted in<br>
Figure 7, the T-circuit comprises two elbows 40, 70.<br>
More specifically, the circuit in Figure 7 comprises an<br>
entry branch 10 to the T, connected to the entry<br>
port 10 and two perpendicular branches 20,30 which,<br>
according to the present invention, have the same<br>
length L2 equal to a multiple of ?g/2.<br>
As depicted in Figure 7, the branch 30 is<br>
extended by an elbow 40 and a line element 50 of<br>
length L1 to arrive at an exit port P20. On the other<br>
hand, the branch 20 is extended by an elbow 70 preceded<br>
and followed by line elements 60 and 80 which make it<br>
possible to obtain the phase shift . According to the<br>
present invention, the elements 60 and 80 are produced<br>
in such a way as to give each a phase shift identical<br>
to /2. Furthermore, the element 80 is extended by a<br>
line element 90 of length L1 arriving at a port P30.<br>
Simulations have been carried out in the same<br>
way as the simulations carried out with the first<br>
embodiment. Thus, Figure 8 depicts the variation in<br>
phase shift of a T-circuit as a function of frequency,<br>
according to the above embodiment. In this case, the<br>
variation in phase shift of a T-circuit with a<br>
phase-shifting element comprising two elbows is<br>
compared with a line of length L such that bL = 180°.<br>
In this case, the variation in phase is now only<br>
about 14° as opposed to 30° over a bandwidth from 11 to<br>
13 GHz.<br>
Figure 9 depicts a T-circuit with a<br>
phase-shifting element with two elbows, in which the<br>
phase shift is not distributed evenly. As depicted in<br>
Figure 9, it may be seen that, in this case, the<br>
variation in the phase shift is approximately identical<br>
to the variation in phase shift of a line at 180°.<br>
Figure 10 simulates the case of a T-circuit<br>
with a phase-shifting element and two elbows in which<br>
the length of the two branches 20, 30 is not equal to<br>
?g/2. It may be seen in this case that the variation in<br>
phase shift with frequency is greater than the phase<br>
shift of a line of length 180°.<br>
Figures 11 and 12 depict two exemplary<br>
applications using T-circuits with phase-shifting<br>
element such as those described hereinabove.<br>
Figure 11 depicts a printed antenna network<br>
with a supply circuit using a T-circuit with a<br>
phase-shifting element according to the present<br>
invention. More specifically, this is a four-patch<br>
network with printed patches 100, 101, 102, 103<br>
connected to a supply circuit produced using microstrip<br>
technology. The network of the four patches<br>
100, 101, 102, 103 is connected to each branch of the T<br>
as follows: the two patches 100, 101 are connected by<br>
line elements of identical length 1 to a point C and<br>
the two patches 102, 103 are connected by line elements<br>
of identical length 1 to a point C. These points C and<br>
C form the ports P20 and P30 of a supply circuit<br>
consisting of a T-circuit with a phase-shifting element<br>
with two elbows as described hereinabove. This supply<br>
circuit therefore comprises a T with two branches of<br>
length L2 = ?g/2, one of the branches L2 being extended<br>
by a line element of length L1 as far as the point C<br>
while the other branch L2 is extended by an elbow with<br>
a phase shift of 90° distributed evenly on each side of<br>
the elbow, then by a line element L1 as far as the<br>
point of connection C".<br>
According to another embodiment, the present<br>
invention may be used as depicted in Figure 12 with<br>
patch networks mounted in the known way in sequential<br>
rotation. More specifically, the printed antennas<br>
network comprises four patches 200, 201, 202, 203<br>
connected in pairs with a first T-circuit with two<br>
elbows which is produced as described hereinabove, the<br>
two T-circuits being connected by an additional<br>
T-circuit with two elbows to an excitation source. More<br>
specifically, the patches 200 and 201 are connected<br>
together by a T-circuit with a phase-shifting element,<br>
giving a phase shift of 90° between the wave received<br>
by the patch 200 and the wave received by the patch<br>
201. The same is true of the patches 202 and 203. This<br>
circuit therefore comprises two branches of length L4<br>
equal to a multiple of ?g/2, the branch connecting to<br>
the patch 200 being extended after an elbow by a line<br>
element L3 while the other branch L4 is extended into<br>
line elements around the elbow, produced in such a way<br>
as to give a phase shift of 45° on each side, then by a<br>
line element L3. In the same way, the patch 203 is<br>
connected to the entry of the T by a line element<br>
L3 then, after an elbow, by the branch L4 of<br>
length ?g/2 while the patch 202 is connected by a line<br>
element L3 followed by an elbow with line elements that<br>
give an evenly distributed phase shift of 45° and a<br>
branch of length L4 equal to ?g/2. The two T-circuits<br>
described are connected to the excitation circuit by<br>
another T-circuit comprising line elements L1 followed<br>
by a branch L2 of length equal to a multiple of ?g/2 on<br>
one side and a line element L1 followed by an elbow<br>
giving an evenly distributed phase shift of 90° on each<br>
side of the elbow and a branch of length L2 = ?g/2. As<br>
a result, a phase shift of 180° is obtained between the<br>
waves sent on the T-circuit supplying the patches 200<br>
and 201 and the T-circuit supplying the patches 202 and<br>
203.<br>
The present invention can also be applied to<br>
other types of network such as phased networks and<br>
makes it possible to envisage networks attuned to a<br>
greater bandwidth than can be achieved with known<br>
circuits.<br>
