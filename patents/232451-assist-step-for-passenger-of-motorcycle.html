				<td>[DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION]<br>
[0001]<br>
[Technical Field OF the Invention] The present invention relates to an assist step for two passengers of a motorcycle.<br>
[0002]<br>
In general, a motorcycle for two passengers has a double-seat for a drive and a fellow passenger and moreover driver's steps on which a drive can put his legs thereon at the former part of body and assist steps on which a fellow passenger can put her legs thereon at the rear part of body.<br>
The assist step has been modified many times so that a fellow passenger can take a seat in comfortable attitude..  For example, such modifications are realized by the technique described in the refe rences, (1) Japanese Patent Publication No. Hei 6~ 13307, "Assist Foot Step of A Scooter Type Motorcycle" and by the technique (2) that an assist foot step is further provided at the rear part of the bar type assist step. [0003]<br>
According to Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 of the official gazette, the technique (1) teaches that a front stage 16A corresponding to the height of the upper edge of the rear wheel 32 is provided to the rear frame pipe 16 (corresponding to the same reference ntimeral in the official gazette, it is also true hereinafter), and the falling type assist foot steps 66a, 66b (corresponding to the assist step) are fixed to the area near the rear part of this front stage 16A via the brackets 68a, 68b. The assist foot steps 66a, 66b are formed in the shape of a bar (pirion step) and it can be fallen along the lower edge of the rear cover 48 for the accommodation when no fellow passenger is taking a seat. [0004]<br>
The technique (2) teaches a motorcycle for two passengers in such a structure that an assist foot step which is almost rectangular in the plan view is provided at the rear part of the bar type assist step on which a fellow passenger can put her leg and moreover the side elevation of body is covered up to the area in the vicinity of the assist foot step with a cover member-[0005]<br>
[Problems to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
The techniques (1) and (2) suggest that the bar type assist steps and assist foot steps are provided to a body frame made of steel pipe material.<br>
In these years, many kinds of motorcycle are manufactured, in which so-called a monocock type frame is introduced as the body frame.  In such a monocock frame, the steep plate is pressed so that the major cross-section of the body frame becomes hollow section formed by a thin plate.<br>
However, when the bar type assist step, assist foot step and cover member formed by the techniques (1) and (2) are fitted to the monocock type frame, it is not so easy to widely cover the side elevation of the body with a cover member while assuring rigidity of the fitting portions and thereby the fitting structure is considerably complicated.<br>
[0006]	;<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an assist step for passenger of motorcycle which can attach the bar type assist,step, foot step and cover member to the monocock type frame with a simplified structure and also can cover the side elevation of the body in a wide area with the cover member.<br>
[0007]<br>

Fig. 2 is a side view of the motorcycle of the present invention.  The motorcycle 1 is designed as the motorcycle for two passengersr which is composed of a body frame 2,  a  front wheel 21, a rear wheel 22, a' swing arm 23 for supporting the rear wheel 22, a 2-cycle forcible air-cooling type engine 24 and a seat 25, etc. The swing arm 23 is an arm member which is supported to swing vertically with the swing arm supporting part 8 of the body frame 2.  The seat 25 is designed as a double-<br><br>
seat enabling both driver and fellow passenger to take<br>
their seats.<br>
[0009]<br>
The body frame 2 is a so-called a monocock type frame wherein the steep plate is pressed to form a steel pipe so that the major cross-section becomes the hollow section formed by a thin plate.<br>
In more details, the body frame 2 is composed of a head pipe (steering head) 3 made of a steel pipe, a front fork 4 operationally supported by this head pipe 3, a handle 5 coupled with this front fork 4, a center frame (main pipe) 6 made of steel pipe and extended to the rear lower part from the head pipe 3 and a rear frame 7 made of steel plate and is provided continuously from the lower end of this center frame 6-[0010]<br>
Namely, the center frame 5 is extended in the rear lower side up to the swing arm supporting part 8 from the head pipe 3 and the rear frame 7 rises in the rear upper side from the swing arm supporting part 8. The upper end 9 of the rising part is provided with a seat 25 and the upper part of the rear cushion (damper) 26-  The rear cushion 26 suspends the rear part of the<br>
swing arm 23 to the upper end part 9 of the rising part of the rear frame 7.<br>
The front wheel 21 is suspended by the lower end part of the front fork 4. [00ll]<br>
The numeral 31 designates a handle cover covering the handle 5; 32, a front fender covering the upper part of the front wheel 21;  33, a rear fender covering the upper part of the rear wheel 22;  34, a bar type step on which a driver puts on his leg;  35, a shift pedal;  36, a chain cover;  37, a battery box; 38, a main stand. [0012]<br>
Here, the rear frame 7 is provided with an assist step 40, which is composed of a bracket 41 for step, a bar type assist step (pirion step) 42, a cover member 43 and an assist foot step 44.<br>
In more detail, the rear frame 7 attaches, at its swing arm supporting part 8, the bracket 41 for step which is extended to the rear side to become narrower and is formed almost in triangular shape in the side view and the frame 41 for bracket attaches, at its rear part, the bar type assist step 42.  Moreover, the rear frame 7 has a structure that the cover member 43<br>
covering the side elevation Of the body is dropped from the left side (front side in this figure) of the upper end part 9 of the rising part. [0013]<br>
Here, the assist foot step 44 is attached between the rear end part of the bracket 41 for step and the lower end part of the cover member 43.  Thereby, the side elevation of the body is covered, with the cover member 43, up to the area in the vicinity of the bar type assist step 42 and in the vicinity of the assist foot step 44.  Therefore, almost upper half of the rear wheel 22 is covered with the cover member 43. [0014]<br>
Fig. 2 is a cross-sectional view along the<br>
line 2-2 showing a structure of cross-section of the<br>
swing arm supporting part 8. The right half of the rear<br>
frame 7 is omitted.	.<br>
The swing arm supporting part 8 and the assist supporting part 12 at the lower side of the swing arm supporting part 8 have the structure that the supporting members 13, 16 are provided, by the welding, through right and left side walls of the rear frame 7.<br>
The supporting member 13 made of steel pipe of the swing arm supporting part 8 allows insertion of a<br><br>
bolt 14 and this bolt 14 supports at its left end part the pivot 23a of the swing arm 23 to swing and moreover fixes at its external side the bracket 41 for step made of steel plate with a nut 15.  The supporting member 16 made of steel rod of the assist supporting part 12 fixes at its left end part the bracket 41 for step with a bolt 17.<br>
Thereby, the bracket 41 for step can be attached at its base part in the two position in vertical. [0015]<br>
Pig. 3 is a cross-sectional view along the line 3-3 of Fig. 1, showing the cross-sectional structure fitting the cover member 43 to the upper end part 9 of the rising part of the rear frame 7.  The right half of the rear frame 7 is omitted.<br>
The upper end part 9 of the rising part of the rear frame 7 indicated by a virtual line fixes at its left side surface a support 18 with the welding and the upper bracket 45 of the upper part of the cover.member 43 is fixed to the cover member 43 with a bolt 19. [0016]<br>
Fig- 4 is an assembling perspective view of an assist step in relation to the present invention.  The<br><br>
cover member 43 plays a role of a protection screen which prevents catching of a part of body and cloth by the rear wheel when a fellow passenger takes the seat 25 (refer to Fig. 1).  For example, many rod bars 43b ... (... indicates plurality) are extended in the frame 43a formed by a pipe.<br>
The assist foot step 44 explained above is formed almost in the rectangular shape which is elongated in the front and rear direction of the body. For example, many rod bars 44b ... are extended in the frame 44a made of a pipe. [0017]<br>
Fig. 5 is a disassembled perspective view of the assist step in relation to the present invention. The bracket 41 for step is provided with a bar type assist step 42 at the rear part and is further provided with a bolt 46 at the rear end part.  The reference numeral 47 designates a nut.<br>
The assist foot step 44 fixes its front end part to the bracket 41 for step with a bolt 46 and also fixes its rear end part to the U-shaped hanger 48 provided at the lower end part of the cover member 43 with a bolt 48. [0018]<br>
Next, operation of the assist step 40 in the structure explained above will then be explained by referring to Fig. 1.<br>
In the rear frame 7 completed as the monocock type frame, the swing arm supporting part 8 for supporting the swing arm 23 and the upper end part 9 of the rising part for fitting the rear cushion 26 have higher rigidity than that of the other part because heavier loads are applied thereon.<br>
The assist step 40 provides, in coupling with each other, the bracket 41 for step, assist foot step 44 and cover member 43 by making use of the swing arm supporting part 8 and upper end part 9 of the rising part having a higher rigidity.<br>
Therefore, the bar type assist step 42 and assist foot step 44 may be attached without providing a complicated structure to the rear frame 7 to give a higher rigidity and moreover the side elevation of the body can be covered with the cover member 43 in the wider area.<br>
[0019]<br>
In the embodiment of the present invention, the body frame 2 is characterized in the monocock type frame, which comprehends a structure, for example.<br><br>
formed only with a steel plate, in addition to the structure completed by steel plate and steel pipe.<br>
Moreover, the bracket 41 for step, bar type assist step 42, cover member 43 and assist foot step 44 are not limited only to the structure where these are arranged in the left side of the body of a motorcycle 1 and these may also be arranged, for example, to the right side of the body or both sides of the body.<br>
When the bracket 41 for step, cover member 43 and assist foot step 44 are arranged only in the right or left side of the body, a fellow passenger can take the seat 25 from the sideway and put her leg on the assist foot step 44,<br>
Moreover, when the bracket 41 for step, bar type assist step 42, cover member 43 and assist foot step 44 are provided in both sides of the body, a fellow passenger can take the seat 25 by crossing over the body and puts her legs on the bar type assist steps 42 and assist foot steps 44.<br>
[0020]<br>
Since the bracket 41 for step is coupled, at its rear end part, with the upper end part 9 of the rising part of the rear frame 7 via the cover member 43 and assist foot step 44, it is not limited to the<br>
structure that the base end part is fixed at two positions of the swing arm supporting part 8 and the assist supporting part 12 and it sufficiently plays the role of the bracket even when it is fixed only to the swing arm supporting part 8.<br>
In addition, the swing arm supporting part 8 and the bracket 41 for step are not limited to the structure that these are fitted with only one bolt and may be fitted with a plurality of bolts and moreover these may also be fitted by riveting or welding, in place of using a bolt.<br>
[0021]<br>
Moreover, it is desirable that the bracket 41 for step is completed almost in the triangular shape in its side view because a load is centralized to the base part, but it is not limited to this shape when consideration is taken for the rigidity.  The bracket 41 for step is not limited to a plate material and may be formed, for example, with angled steel. [0022]<br>
[Effect of the Invention]<br>
With the structure explained above, the present invention provides the following effects.In the invention of the claim 1, a bracket for<br>
step which is extended to the rear part to become<br>
thinner and is formed in almost the triangular shape in<br>
the side view is attached to the swing arm supporting<br>
part, a bar type assist step is fitted to the rear part<br>
of the bracket for step, meanwhile a cover member<br>
covering the side elevation of the body is dropped from<br>
the upper end part of the rising part and an assist foot<br>
step which is formed almost in the rectangular shape in<br>
the plan view is attached between the lower end part of<br>
the cover member and the rear end part of said bracket<br>
for step, in view of covering the side elevation of the<br>
body up to the vicinity of the bar type assist step and<br>
the vicinity of the assist foot step with the cover<br>
member, thereby the bar type assist step and assist foot<br>
step can be attached by making use of the swing arm<br>
supporting part and upper end part of the rising part<br>
having a higher rigidity among the monocock type £rarae<br>
and the side elevation of the body can be covered with<br>
the cover member in a wide area. [Description of the Reference Numerals]<br>
