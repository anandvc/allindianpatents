				<td>DIBENZYL  AMINE  DERIVATIVES  AS   CETP   INHIBITORS<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to dibenzyl amine compounds and derivatives, pharmaceutical compositions containing such compounds and their use to elevate certain plasma lipid levels, including high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesteroi and to lower certain other plasma lipid levels, such as low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol and triglycerides and accordingly to treat diseases which are affected by tow levels of HOL cholesterol and/or high levels of LOL-cholesterol and triglycerides, such as atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases in certain mammals (i.e., those which have CETP in their plasma), including humans.<br>
Atherosclerosis and its associated coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of mortality in the industrialized world. Despite attempts to modify secondary risk factors (smoking, obesity, lack of exercise) and treatment of dyslipidemia with dietary modification and drug therapy, coronary heart disease (CHD) remains the most common cause of death in the U.S., where cardiovascular disease accounts for 44% of all deaths, with 53% of these associated with atherosclerotic coronary heart disease.<br>
Risk for development of this condition has been shown to be strongly correlated with certain plasma lipid levels. While elevated LDL-C may be the most recognized form of dyslipidemia, it is by no means the only significant lipid associated contributor to CHD. Low HDL-C is also a known risk factor for CHD (Gordon, D.J., et al.,: "High-density Lipoprotein Cholesterol and Cardiovascular Disease", Circulation, (1989), 79: 8-15).<br>
High LDL-cholesterol and triglyceride levels are positively correlated, while high levels of HDL-cholesterol are negatively correlated with the risk for developing cardiovascular diseases. Thus, dyslipidemia is not a unitary risk profile for CHD but may be comprised of one or more lipid aberrations.<br>
Among the many factors controlling plasma levels of these disease dependent principles, cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) activity affects all three. The role of this 70,000 dalton plasma glycoprotein found in a number of animal species, including humans, is to transfer cholesteryl ester and triglyceride between lipoprotein particles, including high density lipoproteins (HDL), low density lipoproteins (LDL), very low density lipoproteins (VLDL), and chylomicrons. The net result of CETP activity is a lowering of HDL cholesterol and an increase in LDL cholesterol. This effect on lipoprotein profile is believed to be pro-atherogenic, especially in subjects whose lipid profile constitutes an increased risk for CHD.<br>
No wholly satisfactory HDL-elevating therapies are on the market today. Niacin can significantly increase HDL, but has serious toleration issues which reduce compliance. Fibrates and the HMG CoA reductase inhibitors raise HDL-C, but in some patients, the result is an increase of modest porportions (-10-12%). As a result, there is an unmet medical need for an approved therapeutic agent that elevates plasma HDL levels, thereby reversing or slowing the progression of atherosclerosis.<br>
Thus, although there are a variety of anti-atherosclerosis therapies, there is a continuing need and a continuing search in this field of art for alternative therapies.<br>

Before the present compounds, compositions and methods are disclosed and described, it is to be understood that this invention is not limited to specific synthetic methods of making that may of course vary. It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting.<br>
The present invention also relates to the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of compounds of the present invention. The acids which are used to prepare the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the aforementioned base compounds of this invention are those which form non-toxic acid addition salts, (i.e.. salts containing pharmacologically acceptable anions, such as the hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, nitrate, sulfate, bisulfate, phosphate, acid phosphate, acetate, lactate, citrate, acid citrate, tartrate, bitartrate, succinate, maleate, fumarate, gluconate, saccharate, benzoate, methanesulfonate, ethanesulfonate, benzenesulfonate, p-toluenesulfonate and pamoate (i.e.. 1,1'-methylene-bis-(2-hydroxy-3- naphthoate)) salts.<br>
The invention also relates to base addition salts of the compounds of the present invention. The chemical bases that may be used as reagents to prepare pharmaceutically acceptable base salts of those compounds of the present invention that are acidic in nature are those that form non-toxic base salts with such compounds. Such non-toxic base salts include, but are not limited to those derived from such pharmacologically acceptable cations such as alkali metal cations (e.g., potassium and sodium) and alkaline earth metal cations (e.g.. calcium and magnesium), ammonium or water-soluble amine addition salts such as N-methylglucamine-(meglumine), and the lower alkanolammonium and other base salts of pharmaceutically acceptable organic amines.<br>
The chemist of ordinary skill will recognize that certain compounds of this invention will contain one or more atoms which may be in a particular stereochemical or geometric configuration, giving rise to stereoisomers and configurational isomers. All such isomers and mixtures thereof are included in this invention. Hydrates and solvates of the compounds of this invention are also included.<br>
Where the compounds of the present invention possess two or more stereogenic centers and the absolute or relative stereochemistry is given in the name, the designations R and S refer respectively to<br>
each stereogenic center in ascending numerical order (1, 2, 3, etc.) according to the conventional IUPAC number schemes for each molecule. Where the compounds of the present invention possess one or more stereogenic centers and no stereochemistry is given in the name or structure, it is understood that the name or structure is intended to encompass all forms of the compound, including the racemic form.<br>
The compounds of this invention may contain olefin-like double bonds. When such bonds are present, the compounds of the invention exist as cis and trans configurations and as mixtures thereof. The term "cis" refers to the orientation of two substituents with reference to each other and the plane of the ring (either both "up" or both "down"). Analogously, the term "trans" refers to the orientation of two substituents with reference to each other and the plane of the ring (the substituents being on opposite sides of the ring).<br>
Alpha and Beta refer to the orientation of a substituent with reference to the plane of the ring. Beta is above the plane of the ring and Alpha is below the plane of the ring.<br>
This invention also includes isotopically-labeled compounds, which are identical to those described by formula I, except for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by one or more atoms having specific atomic mass or mass numbers. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, fluorine, and chlorine such as 2H, 3H, 13C, 14C, 15N, 1aO, 17O, 18F, and 38Cl respectively. Compounds of the present invention, prodrugs thereof, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds or of the prodrugs which contain the aforementioned isotopes and/or other isotopes of other atoms are within the scope of this invention. Certain isotopically-labeled compounds of the present invention, for example those into which radioactive isotopes such as 3H and 14C are incorporated, are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated (i.e., 3H), and carbon-14 (i.e., 14C), isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium (i.e., 2H), can afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements and, hence, may be preferred in some circumstances. Isotopically labeled compounds of this invention and prodrugs thereof can generally be prepared by carrying out the procedures disclosed in the schemes and/or in the Examples below, by substituting a readily available isotopically labeled reagent for a non-isotopically labeled reagent.<br>

may be prepared by acidic or basic hydrolysis of a compound of Formula 5, for example with a suitable acid such as sulphuric acid. The compound of Formula 6 may also be prepared from the Formula 5 compounds by partial reduction, for example with an aluminum hydride reagent such as diisobutylaluminum hydride (DIBAL) in a suitable reaction inert solvent such as THF at a temperature between -78Â°C and 25Â°C.<br>
As shown in Scheme 1, compounds of Formula 3 may be prepared by reduction of the compounds of Formula 2 with a suitable reducing agent such as lithium aluminium hydride (LAH), or borane-tetrahydrofuran complex in a reaction inert solvent such as dioxan, diethyl ether or THF.

Alternatively, compounds of Formula 15 may be prepared from compounds of Formula 13 by a variety of methods well known to those skilled in the arts. For example in the case where A is an optionally substituted aromatic ring it is often possible to use the appropriate halogen derivative of A and displace the halogen with the secondary amine of the Formula 13 compound generally in the presence of a base.

The reaction proceeds via formation of an imine which may be facilitated by a dehydrating agent such as 4A molecular sieves in toluene at a temperature between 20Â°C and 111Â°C, preferably 100Â°C-111Â°C, followed by removal of the solvent. Alternatively a titanium compound, preferably titanium tetraisopropoxide, may be employed preferably in the absence of a solvent at room temperature. The imine is then reduced in a suitable reaction inert solvent, preferably ethanol, with a suitable hydride reducing agent, preferably sodium borohydride, at a temperature between 0Â°C and 80Â°C, preferably 20Â°C-50Â°C.<br>

Alternatively compounds of Formula 13 may be prepared by alkylation of compounds of Formula 7 with an alkyl halide of Formula 12 using a suitable base such as triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine.<br>
potassium carbonate, sodium hydride or potassium tert-butoxide, preferably potassium tert-butoxide in a suitable reaction inert solvent such as THF, methylene chloride or dioxane, preferably THF, at a temperaturebetween -40Â°C and 40Â°C, preferably 0-30Â°C.<br>
Compounds of Formula 17 wherein R11 and R12 are as defined above may be prepared from compounds of Formula 16 by the addition of a Grignard reagent R11MgBr such as ethyl or isopropyl magnesium bromide in a suitable reaction inert solvent such as toluene or THF followed by quenching with methanol. The intermediate imine thus obtained is then treated with a suitable reducing agent such as sodium borohydride in methanol to give the compound of Formula 17. The nitrile of Formula 16 may be prepared from the halide of Formula 15, preferably a bromide, by reaction with copper(l) cyanide in a suitable reaction inert solvent such as dimethylformamide or N-methylpyrrolidinone, preferably DMF, at a temperature between 100Â°C and 170Â°C, preferably 170Â°C.<br>

In another aspect of this invention a compound of Formula I in which R   is H may be obtained from a compound of Formula 18A by addition of a Grignard reagent such as ethyl or isopropyl magnesium bromide in a suitable inert solvent such as toluene.

R.; Yannakopoulou, K.; Lue, P.; Rasala, D.; Urogdi, L. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I, 1989, 2, 225-233).<br>
Additionally, compounds of Formula I may be prepared by conversion of aldehydes of Formula 18 to the corresponding compounds of Formula 18B in which Z is OH, by reaction with Grignard reagents R11MgBr such as ethyl or isopropyl magnesium bromide, or fluoroalkylsilanes in the presence of a fluoride source, followed by oxidation to the corresponding ketone of Formula 18C and subsequent reductive amination with the desired amine BH under conditions readily determined by one skilled in the art. In an alternative procedure the compounds of Formula 18B in which Z is OH may be activated for example by reaction with methanesulfonyl chloride in a reaction inert solvent such as methylene chloride in the presence of a suitable base such as triethylamine to give a compound of Formula 18B in which Z is mesyloxy. Alternatively activation may be achieved by conversion to the corresponding halides by a variety of halogenating agents well known to those skilled in the art (for example as described in L.A.

As an initial note, in the preparation of compounds, it is noted that some of the preparation methods useful for the preparation of the compounds described herein may require protection of remote functionality (e.g., primary amine, secondary amine, carboxyl in intermediates). The need for such protection will vary depending on the nature of the remote functionality and the conditions of the preparation methods. The need for such protection is readily determined by one skilled in the art. The use of such protection/deprotection methods is also within the skill in the art. For a general description of protecting groups and their use, see T.W. Greene, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis. John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1991.<br>
For example, in the reaction schemes, certain compounds contain primary amines or carboxylic acid functionalities which may interfere with reactions at other sites of the molecule if left unprotected. Accordingly, such functionalities may be protected by an appropriate protecting group which may be removed in a subsequent step.   Suitable protecting groups for amine and carboxylic acid protection include those protecting groups commonly used in peptide synthesis (such as N-t-butoxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, and 9-fluorenylmethylenoxycarbonyl for amines and lower alkyl or benzyl esters for carboxylic acids) which are generally not chemically reactive under the reaction conditions described and can typically be removed without chemically altering other functionality in the compound.<br>
Prodrugs of the compounds of the present invention may be prepared according to methods known to those skilled in the art. Exemplary processes are described below.<br>
Prodrugs of this invention where a carboxyl group in a carboxylic acid of the compounds is replaced by an ester may be prepared by combining the carboxylic acid with the appropriate alkyl halide in the presence of a base such as potassium carbonate in an inert solvent such as dimethylformamide at<br>

Alternatively the acid is combined with an appropriate alcohol as solvent in the presence of a catalytic amount of acid such as concentrated sulfuric acid at a temperature of about 20 to l000C, preferably at a reflux, for about 1 hour to about 24 hours. Another method is the reaction of the acid with a stoichiometric amount of the alcohol in the presence of a catalytic amount of acid in an inert solvent such as toluene or tetrahydrofuran, with concomitant removal of the water being produced by physical (e.g., Dean-Stark trap) or chemical (e.g., molecular sieves) means.<br>
Prodrugs of this invention where an alcohol function has been derivatized as an ether may be prepared by combining the alcohol with the appropriate alkyl bromide or iodide in the presence of a base such as potassium carbonate in an inert solvent such as dimethylformamide at a temperature of about 0 to 100Â°C for about 1 to about 24 hours. Alkanoylaminomethyl ethers may be obtained by reaction of the alcohol with a bis-(alkanoylamino)methane in the presence of a catalytic amount of acid in an inert solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, according to a method described in US 4,997,984.

Examples of ACAT inhibitors include compounds such as Avasimibe (Pfizer), CS-505 (Sankyo) and Eflucimibe (Eli Lilly and Pierre Fabre).<br>
A lipase inhibitor may be used in the combination therapy aspect of the present invention. A lipase inhibitor is a compound that inhibits the metabolic cleavage of dietary triglycerides or plasma phospholipids into free fatty acids and the corresponding glycerides (e.g. EL, HL, etc.). Under normal physiological conditions, lipolysis occurs via a two-step process that involves acylation of an activated serine moiety of the lipase enzyme. This leads to the production of a fatty acid-lipase hemiacetal intermediate, which is then cleaved to release a diglyceride. Following further deacylation, the lipase-fatty acid intermediate is cleaved, resulting in free lipase, a glyceride and fatty acid. In the intestine, the resultant free fatty acids and monoglycerides are incorporated into bile acid-phospholipid micelles, which are subsequently absorbed at the level of the brush border of the small intestine. The micelles eventually enter the peripheral circulation as chylomicrons. Such lipase inhibition activity is readily determined by those skilled in the art according to standard assays (e.g., Methods Enzymol. 286: 190-231).<br>
Pancreatic lipase mediates the metabolic cleavage of fatty acids from triglycerides at the 1- and 3-carbon positions. The primary site of the metabolism of ingested fats is in the duodenum and proximal jejunum by pancreatic lipase, which is usually secreted in vast excess of the amounts necessary for the breakdown of fats in the upper small intestine. Because pancreatic lipase is the primary enzyme required for the absorption of dietary triglycerides, inhibitors have utility in the treatment of obesity and the other related conditions. Such pancreatic lipase inhibition activity is readily determined by those skilled in the art according to standard assays (e.g.. Methods Enzymol. 286: 190-231).<br>
Gastric lipase is an immunologically distinct lipase that is responsible for approximately 10 to 40% of the digestion of dietary fats. Gastric lipase is secreted in response to mechanical stimulation, ingestion of<br>
food, the presence of a fatty meal or by sympathetic agents. Gastric lipolysis of ingested fats is of physiological importance in the provision of fatty acids needed to trigger pancreatic lipase activity in the intestine and is also of importance for fat absorption in a variety of physiological and pathological conditions associated with pancreatic insufficiency. See, for example, C.K. Abrams, et al., Gastroenterology, 92,125 (1987). Such gastric lipase inhibition activity is readily determined by those skilled in the art according to standard assays (e.g., Methods Enzymol. 286: 190-231).<br>
A variety of gastric and/or pancreatic lipase inhibitors are known to one of ordinary skill in the art. Preferred lipase inhibitors are those inhibitors that are selected from the group consisting of lipstatin, tetrahydrolipstatin (orlistat), valilactone, esterastin, ebelactone A, and ebelactone B.

Any glucosidase inhibitor can be used in combination with a compound of the present invention. A glucosidase inhibitor inhibits the enzymatic hydrolysis of complex carbohydrates by glycoside hydrolases, for example amylase or maltase, into bioavailable simple sugars, for csxample, glucose. The rapid metabolic action of glucosidases, particularly following the intake of high levels of carbohydrates, results in a state of alimentary hyperglycemia which, in adipose or diabetic subjects, leads to enhanced secretion of insulin, increased fat synthesis and a reduction in fat degradation. Following such hyperglycemias, hypoglycemia frequently occurs, due to the augmented levels of insulin present. Additionally, it is known chyme remaining in the stomach promotes the production of gastric juice, which initiates or favors the development of gastritis or duodenal ulcers. Accordingly, glucosidase inhibitors are known to have utility in accelerating the passage of carbohydrates through the stomach and inhibiting the<br>
absorption of glucose from the intestine. Furthermore, the conversion of carbohydrates into lipids of the fatty tissue and the subsequent incorporation of alimentary fat into fatty tissue deposits is accordingly reduced or delayed, with the concomitant benefit of reducing or preventing the deleterious abnormalities resulting therefrom. Such glucosidase inhibition activity is readily determined by those skilled in the art according to standard assays (e.g., Biochemistry (1969) 8: 4214).<br>
A generally preferred glucosidase inhibitor includes an amylase inhibitor. An amylase inhibitor is a glucosidase inhibitor that inhibits the enzymatic degradation of starch or glycogen into maltose. Such amylase inhibition activity is readily determined by those skilled in the art according to standard assays (e.g., Methods Enzymol. (1955) 1: 149). The inhibition of such enzymatic degradation is beneficial in reducing amounts of bioavailable sugars, including glucose and maltose, and the concomitant deleterious conditions resulting therefrom.<br>

Osteoporosis is a systemic skeletal disease, characterized by low bone mass and deterioration of bone tissue, with a consequent increase in bone fragility and susceptibility to fracture. In the U.S., the<br>
condition affects more than 25 million people and causes more than 1.3 million fractures each year, including 500,000 spine, 250,000 hip and 240,000 wrist fractures annually. Hip fractures are the most serious consequence of osteoporosis, with 5-20% of patients dying within one year, and over 50% of. survivors being incapacitated.<br>
The elderly are at greatest risk of osteoporosis, and the problem is therefore predicted to increase significantly with the aging of the population. Worldwide fracture incidence is forecasted to increase threeÂ¬fold over the next 60 years, and one study has estimated that there will be 4.5 million hip fractures worldwide in 2050.<br>
Women are at greater risk of osteoporosis than men. Women experience a sharp acceleration of bone loss during the five years following menopause. Other factors that increase the risk include smoking, alcohol abuse, a sedentary lifestyle and low calcium intake.<br>

All of the above refences are hereby incorporated by reference herein.<br>
The starting materials and reagents for the above described compounds, are also readily available or can be easily synthesized by those skilled in the art using conventional methods of organic synthesis. For example, many of the compounds used herein, are related to, or are derived from compounds in which there is a large scientific interest and commercial need, and accordingly many such compounds are commercially available or are reported in the literature or are easily prepared from other commonly available substances by methods which are reported in the literature.<br>
Some of the compounds of this invention or intermediates in their synthesis have asymmetric carbon atoms and therefore are enantiomers or diastereomers. Diasteromeric mixtures can be separated into their individual diastereomers on the basis of their physical chemical differences by methods known per se, for example, by chromatography and/or fractional crystallization. Enantiomers can be separated by, for example, chiral HPLC methods or converting the enantiomeric mixture into a diastereomeric mixture by reaction with an appropriate optically active compound (e.g., alcohol), separating the diastereomers and converting (e.g., hydrolyzing) the individual diastereomers to the corresponding pure enantiomers. Also, an enantiomeric mixture of the compounds or an intermediate in their synthesis which contain an acidic or basic moiety may be separated into their corresponding pure enantiomers by forming a diastereomic salt with an optically pure chiral base or acid (e.g., 1-phenyl-ethyl amine, dibenzyl tartrate or tartaric acid) and separating the diasteromers by fractional crystallization followed by neutralization to break the salt, thus providing the corresponding pure enantiomers. All such isomers, including diastereomers, enantiomers and mixtures thereof are considered as part of this invention for all of the compounds of the present invention, including the compounds of the present invention. Also,<br>
some of the compounds of this invention are atropisomers (e.g., substituted biaryls) and are considered as part of this invention.<br>
More specifically, the compounds of this invention may be obtained in enantiomerically enriched form by resolving the racemate of the final compound or an intermediate in its synthesis, employing chromatography (preferably high pressure liquid chromatography [HPLC]) on an asymmetric resin (preferably Chiralcelâ¢ AD or OD (obtained from Chiral Technologies, Exton, Pennsylvania)) with a mobile phase consisting of a hydrocarbon (preferably heptane or hexane) containing between 0 and 50% isopropanol (preferably between 2 and 20 %) and between 0 and 5% of an alkyl amine (preferably 0.1% of diethylamine). Concentration of the product containing fractions affords the desired materials.<br>
Some of the compounds of this invention are acidic and they form a salt with a pharmaceutically acceptable cation. Some of the compounds of this invention are basic and they form a salt with a pharmaceutically acceptable anion. All such salts are within the scope of this invention and they can be prepared by conventional methods such as combining the acidic and basic entities, usually in a stoichiometric ratio, in either an aqueous, non-aqueous or partially aqueous medium, as appropriate. The salts are recovered either by filtration, by precipitation with a non-solvent followed by filtration, by evaporation of the solvent, or, in the case of aqueous solutions, by lyophilization, as appropriate. The compounds can be obtained in crystalline form by dissolution in an appropriate solvents) such as ethanol, hexanes or water/ethanol mixtures.<br>
In addition, when the compounds of this invention form hydrates or solvates they are also within the scope of the invention.<br>
The compounds of this invention, their prodrugs and the salts of such compounds and prodrugs are all adapted to therapeutic use as agents that inhibit cholesterol ester transfer protein activity in mammals, particularly humans. Thus, the compounds of this invention elevate plasma HDL cholesterol, its associated components, and the functions performed by them in mammals, particularly humans. By virtue of their activity, these agents also reduce plasma levels of triglycerides, VLDL cholesterol, Apo-B, LDL cholesterol and their associated components in mammals, particularly humans. Moreover, these compounds are useful in equalizing LDL cholesterol and HDL cholesterol. Hence, these compounds are useful for the treatment and correction of the various dyslipidemias observed to be associated with the development and incidence of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease, including coronary artery disease, coronary heart disease, coronary vascular disease, peripheral vascular disease, hypoalphalipoproteinemia, hyperbetalipoproteinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, familial-hypercholesterolemia, low HDL and associated components, elevated LDL and associated components, elevated Lp(a), elevated small-dense LDL, elevated VLDL and associated components and post-prandial lipemia.<br>
Further, introduction of a functional CETP gene into an animal lacking CETP (mouse) results in reduced HDL levels (Agellon, LB., et al: J. Biol. Chem. (1991) 266: 10796-10801.) and increased susceptibility to atherosclerosis.(Marotti, K.R., et al: A/art/re (1993) 364: 73-75.). Also, inhibition of CETP<br>
activity with an inhibitory antibody raises HDL-cholesterol in hamster (Evans, G.F., et al: J. of Lipid Research (1994) 35: 1634-1645.) and rabbit (Whitlock, M.E, et al: J. Clin. Invest. (1989) 84: 129-137). Suppression of increased plasma CETP by intravenous injection with antisense oligodeoxynucleotides against CETP mRNA reduced atherosclerosis in cholesterol-fed rabbits (Sugano, M., et al: J. of Biol. Chem. (1998) 273: 5033-5036.) Importantly, human subjects deficient in plasma CETP, due to a genetic mutation possess markedly elevated plasma HDL-cholesterol levels and apolipoprotein A-l, the major apoprotein component of HDL. In addition, most demonstrate markedly decreased plasma LDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein B (the major apolipoprotein component of LDL. (inazu, A., Brown, M.L., Hesler, C.B., et al.: N. Engl. J. Med. (1990) 323: 1234-1238.)<br>
Given the negative correlation between the levels of HDL cholesterol and HDL associated lipoproteins, and the positive correlation between triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, and their associated apolipoproteins in blood with the development of cardiovascular, cerebral vascular and peripheral vascular diseases, the compounds of this invention, their prodrugs and the salts of such compounds and prodrugs, by virtue of their pharmacologic action, are useful for the prevention, arrestment and/or regression of atherosclerosis and its associated disease states. These include cardiovascular disorders (e.g., angina, ischemia, cardiac ischemia and myocardial infarction), complications due to cardiovascular disease therapies (e.g., reperfusion injury and angioplastic restenosis), hypertension, elevated cardiovascular risk associated with hypertension, stroke, atherosclerosis associated with organ transplantation, cerebrovascular disease, cognitive dysfunction (including, but not limited to, dementia secondary to atherosclerosis, transient cerebral ischemic attacks, neurodegeneration, neuronal deficient, and delayed onset or procession of Alzheimer's disease), elevated levels of oxidative stress, elevated levels of C-Reactive Protein, Metabolic Syndrome and elevated levels of HbA1C.<br>
Because of the beneficial effects widely associated with elevated HDL levels, an agent which inhibits CETP activity in humans, by virtue of its HDL increasing ability, also provides valuable avenues for therapy in a number of other disease areas as well.<br>
Thus, given the ability of the compounds of this invention, their prodrugs and the salts of such compounds and prodrugs to alter lipoprotein composition via inhibition of cholesterol ester transfer, they are of use in the treatment of vascular complications associated with diabetes, lipoprotein abnormalities associated with diabetes and sexual dysfunction associated with diabetes and vascular disease. Hyperlipidemia is present in most subjects with diabetes mellitus (Howard, B.V. 1987. J. Lipid Res. 28, 613). Even in the presence of normal lipid levels, diabetic subjects experience a greater risk of cardiovascular disease (Kannel, W.B. and McGee, D.L 1979. Diabetes Care 2, 120). CETP-mediated cholesteryl ester transfer is known to be abnormally increased in both insulin-dependent (Bagdade, J.D., Subbaiah, P.V. and Ritter, M.C.  1991. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 21, 161) and non-insulin dependent diabetes (Bagdade. J.D., Ritter, M.C, Lane, J. and Subbaiah. 1993. Atherosclerosis 104, 69). It has been suggested that the abnormal increase in cholesterol transfer results in changes in lipoprotein composition, particularly for VLDL and LDL, that are more atherogenic (Bagdade, J.D., Wagner, J.D.,<br>
Rudel, L.L, and Clarkson, T.B. 1995. J. Lipid Res. 36, 759). These changes would not necessarily be observed during routine lipid screening. Thus the present invention will be useful in reducing the risk of vascular complications as a result of the diabetic condition.<br>
The described agents are useful in the treatment of obesity and elevated cardiovascular risk associated with obesity. In both humans (Radeau, T., Lau, P., Robb, M., McDonnell, M., Ailhaud, G. and McPherson, R., 1995. Journal of Lipid Research. 36 (12):2552-61) and nonhuman primates (Quinet, E., Tall, A., Ramakrishnan, R. and Rudel, L., 1991. Journal of Clinical Investigation. 87 (5):1559-66) mRNA for CETP is expressed at high levels in adipose tissue. The adipose message increases with fat feeding (Martin, L J., Connelly, P. W., Nancoo, D., Wood, N., Zhang, Z. J., Maguire, G., Quinet, E., Tall, A. R., Marcel, Y. L. and McPherson, R., 1993. Journal of Lipid Research. 34 (3):437-46), and Is translated into functional transfer protein and through secretion contributes significantly to plasma CETP levels. In human adipocytes the bulk of cholesterol is provided by plasma LDL and HDL (Fong, B. S., and Angel, A., 1989. Biochimica et Biophysica Acta. 1004 (1):53-60). The uptake of HDL cholesteryl ester is dependent in large part on CETP (Benoist, F., Lau, P., McDonnell, M., Doelle, H., Milne, R. and McPherson, R., 1997. Journal of Biological Chemistry. 272 (38):23572-7). This ability of CETP to stimulate HDL cholesteryl uptake, coupled with the enhanced binding of HDL to adipocytes in obese subjects (Jimenez, J. Gâ Fong, B., Julien, P., Despres, J. P., Rotstein, L., and Angel, A., 1989. International Journal of Obesity. 13 (5):699-709), suggests a role for CETP, not only in generating the low HDL phenotype for these subjects, but in the development of obesity itself by promoting cholesterol accumulation. Inhibitors of CETP activity that block this process therefore serve as useful adjuvants to dietary therapy in causing weight reduction.<br>
CETP inhibitors are useful in the treatment of inflammation due to Gram-negative sepsis and septic shock. For example, the systemic toxicity of Gram-negative sepsis is in large part due to endotoxin, a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) released from the outer surface of the bacteria, which causes an extensive inflammatory response. Lipopolysaccharide can form complexes with lipoproteins (Ulevitch, R.J., Johnston, A.R., and Weinstein, D.B., 1981. J. Clin. Invest 67, 827-37). In vitro studies have demonstrated that binding of LPS to HDL substantially reduces the production and release of mediators of inflammation (Ulevitch, R.J., Johhston, A.R., 1978. J. Clin. Invest. 62, 1313-24). In vivo studies show that transgenic mice expressing human apo-Al and elevated HDL levels are protected from septic shock (Levine, D.M., Parker, T.S., Donnelly, T.M., Walsh, A.M., and Rubin, A.L. 1993. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 90, 12040-44). Importantly, administration of reconstituted HDL to humans challenged with endotoxin resulted in a decreased inflammatory response (Pajkrt, D., Doran, J.E., Koster, F., Lerch, P.G., Arnet, B., van der Poll, T., ten Cate, J.W., and van Deventer, S.J.H. 1996. J. Exp. Med. 184, 1601-08). The CETP inhibitors, by virtue of the fact that they raise HDL levels, attenuate the development of inflammation and septic shock. These compounds would also be useful in the treatment of endotoxemia, autoimmune diseases and other systemic disease indications, organ or tissue transplant rejection and cancer.<br>
The utility of the compounds of the invention, their prodrugs and the salts of such compounds and prodrugs as medical agents in the treatment of the above described disease/conditions in mammals (e.g. humans, male or female) is demonstrated by the activity of the compounds of this invention in conventional assays and the in vitro assay described below. The in vivo assay (with appropriate modifications within the skill in the art) may be used to determine the activity of other lipid or triglyceride controlling agents as well as the compounds of this invention. Such assays also provide a means whereby the activities of the compounds of this invention, their prodrugs and the salts of such compounds and prodrugs (or the other agents described herein) can be compared to each other and with the activities of other known compounds. The results of these comparisons are useful for determining dosage levels in mammals, including humans, for the treatment of such diseases.<br>
The following protocols can of course be varied by those skilled in the art.<br>
The hyperalphacholesterolemic activity of the compounds can be determined by assessing the effect of these compounds on the action of cholesteryl ester transfer protein by measuring the relative transfer ratio of radiolabeled lipids between lipoprotein fractions, essentially as previously described by Morton in J. Biol. Chem. 256, 11992, 1981 and by Dias in Clin. Chem. 34, 2322, 1988.<br>
CETP IN VITRO ASSAY<br>
The following is a brief description of assays of cholesteryl ester transfer in 97% (whole) or diluted human plasma (in vitro) and animal plasma (ex vivo): CETP activity in the presence or absence of drug is assayed by determining the transfer of 3H-labeled cholesteryl oleate (CO) from exogenous tracer HDL or LDL to the nonHDL or HDL lipoprotein fraction in human plasma, respectively, or from 3H-labeled LDL to the HDL fraction in animal plasma. Labeled human lipoprotein substrates are prepared similarly to the method described by Morton in which the endogenous CETP activity in plasma is employed to transfer 3H-CO from phospholipid liposomes to all the lipoprotein fractions in plasma. 3H-labeled LDL and HDL are subsequently isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation at the density cuts of 1.019-1.063 and 1.10-1.21 g/ml, respectively.<br>
For the 97% or whole plasma activity assay, 3H-labeled HDL is added to plasma at 10-25 nmoles CO/ml and the samples incubated at 37Â° C for 2.5-3 hrs. Non-HDL lipoproteins are then precipitated by the addition of an equal volume of 20% (wt/vol) polyethylene glycol 8000 (Dias). The samples are centrifuged 750 g x 20 minutes and the radioactivity contained in the HDL-containing supernatant determined by liquid scintillation counting. Introducing varying quantities of the compounds of this invention as a solution in dimethylsulfoxide into human plasma, before addition of the radiolabeled cholesteryl oleate, and comparing the amounts of radiolabel transferred compared to incubations containing no inhibitor compounds allows the cholesteryl ester transfer inhibitory activities to be determined.<br>
When a more sensitive assay is desirable, an in vitro assay using diluted human plasma is utilized. For this assay, 3H-labeled LDL is added to plasma at 50 nmoles CO/ml and the samples incubated at 37Â° C for 7 hrs.   Non-HDL lipoproteins are then precipitated by the addition of potassium<br>
phosphate to 100 mM final concentration followed by manganese chloride to 20 mM final concentration. After vortexing, the samples are centrifuged 750 g x 20 minutes and the radioactivity contained in the HDL-containing supernatant determined by liquid scintillation counting. Introducing varying quantities of the compounds of this invention as a solution in dimethylsulfoxide into diluted human plasma, before addition of the radiolabeled cholesteryl oleate, and comparing the amounts of radiolabel transferred compared to incubations containing no inhibitor compounds allows the cholesteryl ester transfer inhibitory activities to be determined. This assay has been adapted to run in microtiter plate format with liquid scintillation counting accomplished using a Wallac plate reader.<br>
Alternatively, the CETP inhibitory activity of compounds can be determined using microtiter plate-based fluorescent transfer assays where the CETP-dependent transfer of a self-quenching cholesteryl ester analog (Bodipy-CE) from human ApoAI-containing emulsion particles to the endogenous lipoproteins in plasma is monitored.<br>
Fluorescent Bodipy-CE donors are prepared by drying down 14 mg of PC, 1.6 mg triolein and 3.5 mg of BODIPY-CE at 60Â°C in a vacuum oven and then hydrating the lipids at 80Â°C in 12 ml of PBS by probe sonication (at 25% of full power setting) for 2 min under a stream of N2. The lipid mixture is then cooled to 45Â°C and 5 mg (0.125 ?M) of human apolipoprotein Al (from Biodesign, Saco ME) is added, and again sonicated (at 25% of full power) for 20 min at 45Â°C , pausing after each minute to allow the probe to cool. The resulting emulsion is spun for 30 min at 3000 x g to remove metal probe fragments and then adjusted to 1.12 gm/ml with sodium bromide and layered below a solution of NaBr 1.10 g/ml (16 ml) and subjected to density gradient ultracentrifugation for 24 hours at 50,000-x g to remove unincorporated apolipoprotein Al and small dense particles that remain at the bottom of the gradient. The more buoyant emulsion particles are collected from the top of the gradient and dialyzed in 6 liters (2 changes) of PBS/0.02% azide, and diluted to the appropriate concentrations prior to use.<br>
The CETP-dependent transfer of fluorescent CE analog is monitored in incubations containing the fluorescent human-apolipoprotein Al-containing donor particles, and a source of CETP and acceptor lipoproteins which in these cases are present in diluted human plasma. Bodipy CE fluorescence in the donor particles in the unincubated donor particles is quenched, and the CETP-dependent transfer of Bodipy CE to acceptor particles results in an increase in fluorescence.<br>
When a high sensitivity assay is desired, compounds in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide are tested in a 2.5% plasma 384-well microtiter plate assay.   One microliter of compound in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide is added to wells containing 20 ul of 3.75% human plasma (diluted with PBS) using a clonemaster solution transfer device. Transfer is initiated via the addition of 10 ul of 7.5% donors (also diluted with PBS). Following mixing, each plate is taped or placed in a Matripress plate stacker to avoid evaporation and incubated overnight at room temp. (16-20 hrs). Fluorescence is determined on a fluorescent plate reader, 485/530 nm filters, 505 nm dichroic filter. Note that depending upon liquid handling capabilities the intermediate dilutions of plasma and fluorescent donors and the aliquot size of those dilutions can be adjusted as necessary.<br><br>
When a lower sensitivity assay is desired compounds are tested in a 20% plasma assay that is conceptually similar to the 2.5% assay. Two microliters of compound are added to dry, 96-well, half-area microtiter plates followed by 48 ul of 40% human plasma (diluted in PBS) and 50 ul of 40% donor solution. The fluorescent intensity is monitored after 3 hr incubation at room temperature. In the case of either the 2.5% or the 20% assay, the percent inhibition of CE transfer by compound is calculated by comparing to wells containing fluorescent donors and plasma but no compound.<br>
CETP IN VIVO ASSAY<br>
Activity of these compounds in vivo can be determined by the amount of agent required to be administered, relative to control, to inhibit cholesteryl ester transfer activity by 50% at various time points ex vivo or to elevate HDL cholesterol by a given percentage in a CETP-containing animal species. Transgenic mice expressing both human CETP and human apolipoprotein Al (Charles River, Boston, MA) may be used to assess compounds in vivo. The compounds to be examined are administered by oral gavage in an emulsion vehicle containing 20% (v:v) olive oil and 80% sodium taurocholate (0.5%). Blood is taken from mice retroorbitally before dosing, if a predose blood sample is desirable. At various times after dosing, ranging from 4h to 24h, the animals are sacrificed, blood obtained by heart puncture, and lipid parameters measured, including total cholesterol, HDL and LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides. CETP activity is determined by a method similar to that described above except that 3H-cholesteryl oleate-containing LDL is used as the donor source as opposed to HDL. The values obtained for lipids and transfer activity are compared to those obtained prior to dosing and/or to those from mice receiving vehicle alone.<br>
PLASMA LIPIDS ASSAY<br>
The activity of these compounds may also be demonstrated by determining the amount of agent required to alter plasma lipid levels, for example HDL cholesterol levels, LDL cholesterol levels, VLDL cholesterol levels or triglycerides, in the plasma of certain mammals, for example marmosets that possess CETP activity and a plasma lipoprotein profile similar to that of humans (Crook et al. Arteriosclerosis 10, 625, 1990). Adult marmosets are assigned to treatment groups so that each group has a similar mean Â±SD for total, HDL, and/or LDL plasma cholesterol concentrations. After group assignment, marmosets are dosed daily with compound as a dietary admix or by intragastric intubation for from one to eight days. Control marmosets receive only the dosing vehicle. Plasma total, LDL VLDL and HDL cholesterol values can be determined at any point during the study by obtaining blood from an antecubital vein and separating plasma lipoproteins into their individual subclasses by density gradient centrifugation, and by measuring cholesterol concentration as previously described (Crook et al. Arteriosclerosis 10, 625, 1990).<br>
IN VIVO ATHEROSCLEROSIS ASSAY<br>
Anti-atherosclerotic effects of the compounds can be determined by the amount of compound required to reduce the lipid deposition in rabbit aorta. Male New Zealand White rabbits are fed a diet<br>
containing 0.2% cholesterol and 10% coconut oil for 4 days (meal-fed once per day). Rabbits are bled from the marginal ear vein and total plasma cholesterol values are determined from these samples. The rabbits are then assigned to treatment groups so that each group has a similar mean Â±SD for total plasma cholesterol concentration, HDL cholesterol concentration, triglyceride concentration and/or cholesteryl ester transfer protein activity. After group assignment, rabbits are dosed daily with compound given as a dietary admix or on a small piece of gelatin based confection. Control rabbits receive only the dosing vehicle, be it the food or the gelatin confection. The cholesterol/coconut oil diet is continued along with the compound administration throughout the study. Plasma cholesterol values and cholesteryl ester transfer protein activity can be determined at any point during the study by obtaining blood from the marginal ear vein. After 3-5 months, the rabbits are sacrificed and the aortae are removed from the thoracic arch to the branch of the iliac arteries. The aortae are cleaned of adventitia, opened longitudinally and then analyzed unstained or stained with Sudan IV as described by Holman et al. (Lab. Invest. 195S, 7, 42-47). The percent of the lesioned surface area is quantitated by densitometry using an Optimas Image Analyzing System (Image Processing Systems). Reduced lipid deposition is indicated by a reduction in the percent of lesioned surface area in the compound-receiving group in comparison with the control rabbits.<br>
ANTIOBESITY PROTOCOL The ability of CETP inhibitors to cause weight loss can be assessed in obese human subjects with body mass index (BMI) â¥ 30 kg/m2. Doses of inhibitor are administered sufficient to result in an increase of â¥ 25% in HDL cholesterol levels. BMI and body fat distribution, defined as waist (W) to hip (H) ratio (WHR), are monitored during the course of the 3-6 month studies, and the results for treatment groups compared to those receiving placebo.<br>
IN VIVO SEPSIS ASSAY<br>
In vivo studies show that transgenic mice expressing human apo-AI and elevated HDL levels are protected from septic shock. Thus the ability of CETP inhibitors to protect from septic shock can be demonstrated in transgenic mice expressing both human apo-AI and human CETP transgenes (Levine, D. M., Parker, T.S., Donnelly, T. M., Walsh, A. M. and Rubin, A.L, 1993. Proc. Natl. Acad. Set. 90, 12040-44). LPS derived from E coli is administered at 30mg/kg by i.p. injection to animals which have been administered a CETP inhibitor at an appropriate dose to result in elevation of HDL. The number of surviving mice is determined at times up to 48h after LPS injection and compared to those mice administered vehicle (minus CETP inhibitor) only.<br>
IN VIVO BLOOD PRESSURE ASSAY In vivo rabbit model<br>
Methods: New Zealand White male rabbits (3-4 kg) are anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (30 mg/kg, i.v.) and a surgical plane of anesthesia is maintained by a continuous infusion of sodium pentobarbital (16 mg/kg/hr) via an ear vein catheter. A tracheotomy is performed through a ventral midline cervical incision and the rabbits are ventilated with 100% oxygen using a positive pressure<br>
ventilator. Body temperature is maintained at 38.5Â°C using a heating pad connected to a YSI temperature controller model 72 (Yellow Springs Instruments, Yellow Springs, MD). Ruid-filled catheters are placed in the right jugular vein (for intravenous drug administration) and in the right carotid artery for arterial pressure monitoring and for blood gas analysis using a model 248 blood gas analyzer (Bayer Diagnostics, Norwood, MA). The ventilator is adjusted as needed to maintain blood pH and pCO2 within normal physiological ranges for rabbits. Arterial pressure is measured using a strain gauge transducer (Spectromed, Oxnard, CA), previously calibrated using a mercury manometer, positioned at the level of the heart and connected to the arterial catheter. Arterial pressure signals are digitized at 500 Hz and analyzed using a Po-Ne-Mah Data Acquisition System (Gould Instrument Systems, Valley view, OH) to obtain mean arterial pressure and heart rate values. Baseline values are collected when mean arterial pressure and heart rate have stabilized. The test compound is then administered either as a subcutaneous (SC) bolus or as an intravenous (IV) infusion. For subcutaneous (SC) dosing the test compound can be dissolved in an appropriate vehicle such as 5% ethanol in water (5% EtOH : 95% H2O), while for intravenous dosing the test compound can be dissolved in an appropriate vehicle such as 0.9% normal saline. Arterial pressure and heart rate are monitored continuously for 4 hours following dosing of the test compound or for the duration of a continuous 4 hour infusion of the test compound. Blood is sampled after dosing or during the infusion of the test compound to determine plasma concentrations of the test compounds. In vivo primate model<br>
Methods: Adult M. fascicularis primates (6-8 kg) that have been previously instrumented with subcutaneous vascular access ports in the descending thoracic aorta and conditioned to sit quietly in specially designed primate-restraining chairs are used. All primates are fasted for 12-18 hours prior to the experiment. On the day of the experiment with the primates restrained in the chairs, a strain gauge pressure transducer (Spectromed, Oxnard, CA), previously calibrated using a mercury manometer, is positioned at the level of the heart and connected to the vascular access port to measure arterial pressure. The primates are allowed to acclimate to the chair for at least one hour. Arterial-pressure signals are digitized at 500 Hz and continuously recorded throughout the experiment and analyzed using a Po-Ne-Mah Data Acquisition System (Gould Instrument Systems, Valley View, OH) to obtain the measurements of mean arterial pressure and heart rate. Baseline values are collected when the primates are sitting calmly and when mean arterial pressure and heart rate have stabilized. The test compound is then administered as a subcutaneous (SC) bolus of a solution of the test compound in an appropriate vehicle such as 5% ethanol in water (5% EtOH : 95% H20). The solution of test compound or vehicle is filtered through a 0.22 micron filter prior to injection and a typical dosing volume is 0.2 ml/kg. Arterial pressure and heart rate are monitored continuously for 4 hours following dosing of the test compound and are recorded at selected time intervals for data comparison (vehicle vs test compound). Blood samples (1.5 ml) are withdrawn to determine plasma concentrations of the test compound and withdrawn blood is immediately replaced with 0.9% sterile saline to maintain blood volume.<br>
Administration of the compounds of this invention can be via any method which delivers a compound of this invention systemically and/or locally. These methods include oral routes, parenteral, intraduodenal routes, etc. Generally, the compounds of this invention are administered orally, but parenteral administration (e.g., intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous or intramedullary) may be utilized, for example, where oral administration is inappropriate for the target or where the patient is unable to ingest the drug.<br>
In general an amount of a compound of this invention is used that is sufficient to achieve the therapeutic effect desired (e.g., HDL elevation).<br>
In general an effective dosage for the compounds of this invention is about 0.001 to 100 mg/kg/day of the compound, a prodrug thereof, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of said compound or of said prodrug. An especially preferred dosage is about 0.01 to 10 mg/kg/day of the compound, a prodrug thereof, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of said compound or of said prodrug.<br>
A dosage of the combination pharmaceutical agents to be used in conjuction with the CETP inhibitors is used that is effective for the indication being treated.<br>
For example, typically an effective dosage for HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors is in the range of 0.01 to 100 mg/kg/day. In general an effect dosage for a PPAR modulator is in the range of 0.01 to 100 mg/kg/day.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are generally administered in the form of a pharmaceutical composition comprising at least one of the compounds of this Invention together with a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle, diluent or carrier as described below. Thus, the compounds of this invention can be administered individually or together in any conventional oral, parenteral, rectal or transdermal dosage form.<br>
For oral administration a pharmaceutical composition can take the form of solutions, suspensions, tablets, pills, capsules, powders, and the like. Tablets containing various excipients such as sodium citrate, calcium carbonate and calcium phosphate are employed along with various disintegrants such as starch and preferably potato or tapioca starch and certain complex silicates, together with binding agents such as polyvinylpyrrolidone, sucrose, gelatin and acacia. Additionally, lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, sodium lauryl sulfate and talc are often very useful for tabletting purposes. Solid compositions of a similar type are also employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules; preferred materials in this connection also include lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols. A preferred formulation is a solution or suspension in an oil, for example, a vegetable oil, such as olive oil; triglycerides such as those marketed under the name, Miglyolâ¢; or mono- or digiycerides such as those marketed under the name, Capmulâ¢, for example, in a soft gelatin capsule. Antioxidants may be added to prevent long-term degradation as appropriate. When aqueous suspensions and/or elixirs are desired for oral administration, the compounds of this invention can be combined with various sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents, emulsifying agents and/or<br>
suspending agents, as well as such diluents as water, ethanol, propylene glycol, glycerin and various like combinations thereof.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions comprising a solid amorphous dispersion of a cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitor and a concentration-enhancing polymer are described in International Publication Nos. WO 02/11710 and WO 03/000238, which are hereby incorporated by reference herein. Self-emulsifying formulations of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitors are described in International Publication No. WO 03/000295, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein. Methods for depositing small drug crystals on excipients are set forth in the literature, such as in J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 1987, 39:769-773, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein.<br>
For purposes of parenteral administration, solutions in sesame or peanut oil or in aqueous propylene glycol can be employed, as well as sterile aqueous solutions of the corresponding water-soluble salts. Such aqueous solutions may be suitably buffered, if necessary, and the liquid diluent first rendered isotonic with sufficient saline or glucose. These aqueous solutions are especially suitable for intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous and intraperitoneal injection purposes. In this connection, the sterile aqueous media employed are all readily obtainable by standard techniques well-known to those skilled in the art<br>
For purposes of transdermal (e.g.,topical) administration, dilute sterile, aqueous or partially aqueous solutions (usually in about 0.1% to 5% concentration), otherwise similar to the above parenteral solutions, are prepared.<br>
Methods of preparing various pharmaceutical compositions with a certain amount of active ingredient are known, or will be apparent in light of this disclosure, to those skilled in this art For examples of methods of preparing pharmaceutical compositions, see Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences. Mack Publishing Company, Easter, Pa., 15th Edition (1975).<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention may contain 0.1%-95% of the compound(s) of this invention, preferably 1%-70%. In any event, the composition or formulation to be administered will contain a quantity of a compound(s) according to the invention in an amount effective to treat the disease/condition of the subject being treated, e.g., atherosclerosis.<br>
Since the present invention has an aspect that relates to the treatment of the disease/conditions described herein with a combination of active ingredients which may be administered separately, the invention also relates to combining separate pharmaceutical compositions in kit form. The kit comprises two separate pharmaceutical compositions: a compound of the present invention, a prodrug thereof or a salt of such compound or prodrug and a second compound as described above. The kit comprises means for containing the separate compositions such as a container, a divided bottle or a divided foil packet. Typically the kit comprises directions for the administration of the separate components. The kit form is particularly advantageous when the separate components are preferably administered in different dosage forms (e.g., oral and parenteral), are administered at different dosage intervals, or when titration of the individual components of the combination is desired by the prescribing physician.<br>
An example of such a kit is a so-called blister pack. Blister packs are well known in the packaging industry and are being widely used for the packaging of pharmaceutical unit dosage forms (tablets, capsules, and the like). Blister packs generally consist of a sheet of relatively stiff material covered with a foil of a preferably transparent plastic material. During the packaging process recesses are formed in the plastic foil. The recesses have the size and shape of the tablets or capsules to be packed. Next, the tablets or capsules are placed in the recesses and the sheet of relatively stiff material is sealed against the plastic foil at the face of the foil which is opposite from the direction in which the recesses were formed. As a result, the tablets or capsules are sealed in the recesses between the plastic foil and the sheet. Preferably the strength of the sheet is such that the tablets or capsules can be removed from the blister pack by manually applying pressure on the recesses whereby an opening is formed in the sheet at the place of the recess. The tablet or capsule can then be removed via said opening.<br>
It may be desirable to provide a memory aid on the kit, e.g., in the form of numbers next to the tablets or capsules whereby the numbers correspond with the days of the regimen which the tablets or capsules so specified should be ingested. Another example of such a memory aid is a calendar printed on the card, e.g., as follows "First Week, Monday, Tuesday, ...etc.... Second Week, Monday, Tuesday,..." etc. Other variations of memory aids will be readily apparent. A "daily dose" can be a single tablet or capsule or several pills or capsules to be taken on a given day. Also, a daily dose of compounds of the present invention can consist of one tablet or capsule while a daily dose of the second compound can consist of several tablets or capsules and vice versa. The memory aid should reflect this.<br>
In another specific embodiment of the invention, a dispenser designed to dispense the daily doses one at a time in the order of their intended use is provided. Preferably, the dispenser is equipped with a memory-aid, so as to further facilitate compliance with the regimen. An example of such a memory-aid is a mechanical counter which indicates the number of daily doses that has been dispensed. Another example of such a memory-aid is a battery-powered micro-chip memory coupled with a liquid crystal readout, or audible reminder signal which, for example, reads out the date that the last daily dose has been taken and/or reminds one when the next dose is to be taken.<br>
The compounds of this invention either alone or in combination with each other or other compounds generally will be administered in a convenient formulation. The following formulation examples only are illustrative and are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>

The following examples are put forth so as to provide those of ordinary skill in the art with a disclosure and description of how the compounds, compositions, and methods claimed herein are made and evaluated, and are intended to be purely exemplary of the invention and are not intended to limit the scope of what the inventors regard as their invention. Unless indicated otherwise, percent is percent by weight given the component and the total weight of the composition, temperature is in Â°C or is at ambient temperature, and pressure is at or near atmospheric.   Commercial reagents were utilized without further purification. Room or ambient temperature refers to 20-25 Â°C. All non-aqueous reactions were run under a nitrogen atmosphere for convenience and to maximize yields. Concentration in vacuo means that a rotary evaporator was used. The names for the compounds of the invention were created by the Autonom 2.0 PC-batch version from Beilstein Informationssysteme GmbH (ISBN 3-89536-976-4) or by ChemdrawÂ® Ultra, CambridgeSoft Corporation, Cambridge MA.   The chemical structures depicted may be only exemplary of the general structure or of limited isomers, and not include specific stereochemistry as recited in the chemical name. Some of the examples are prepared in a racemic form and a procedure for resolving the racemate into individual enantiomers is described. In certain cases the absolute stereochemistry of these enantiomers is not determined however both are within the scope of this invention. In these cases the order of presentation of the enantiomeric structures does not imply any relationship to their chromatographic order of separation.<br>
NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Unity 400 (Varian Co., Palo Alto, CA) NMR spectrometer at ambient temperature. Chemical shifts are expressed in parts per million (5) relative to an external standard (tetramethylsilane). The peak shapes are denoted as follows: s, singlet; d, doublet, t, triplet, q, quartet, m, multiplet with the prefix br indicating a broadened signal. The coupling constant (J) data given have a maximum error of Â±0.41 Hz due to the digitization of the spectra that are acquired. Mass spectra were obtained by (1) atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) in alternating positive and negative ion mode using a Fisons Platform II Spectrometer or a Micromass MZD Spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK) or (2) electrospray ionization in alternating positive and negative ion mode using a Micromass MZD Spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK) with a Gilson LC-MS interface (Gilson Instruments, Middleton, Wl), (3) a QP-8000 mass spectrometer (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) operating in positive or negative single ion monitoring mode, utilizing electrospray ionization or<br>
