				<td>inductive Sensor<br>
The present invention relates to an inductive sensor having an electric coil subassembly<br>
according to the preamble of claim 1.<br>
Inductive sensors are used, for example, for sensing speeds of revolution of vehicle wheels,<br>
possibly, in order to generate input signals for vehicle anti-lock braking systems. A known<br>
sensor for sensing speeds of revolution is described in, for example, EP 0 384 014 B1.<br>
In sensors of the general type under consideration, the coil wire usually must be routed to two<br>
electric terminals, which are formed from sheet metal strips, for example, in order to achieve<br>
sufficient mechanical stability. To take advantage of available installation space, the coil<br>
wire itself is made from relatively thin wire, which is therefore susceptible to breakage. In<br>
such sensors, therefore, the coil subassembly is coated at least partly with an injection-<br>
molding compound in order to increase its mechanical stability. The area of the wire ends<br>
extending out of the coil winding to the terminals is usually also coated in the same operation.<br>
Because of different thermal expansion coefficients of the wire material, such as copper, and<br>
of the injection-molding compound, stresses and strains between the wire and the compound<br>
can develop during temperature fluctuations, and in the case of extremely frequent<br>
temperature fluctuations, may lead to damage to the wire ends led out of the coil winding to<br>
the terminals.<br>
The object of the present invention is therefore to provide an improved inductive sensor with<br>
respect to thermal fatigue resistance.<br>
 <br>
This object is achieved by the embodiment of the present invention specified in claim 1.<br>
Improvements and advantageous configurations of the invention are specified in the<br>
additional claims.<br>
By means of the present invention, the thermal fatigue resistance of an inductive sensor can<br>
be improved considerably in a simple and cost-effective manner, specifically, by providing a<br>
barrier for the injection-molding compound. Experiments have shown that the number of<br>
temperature-change cycles can be increased immediately by a factor of five by the present<br>
invention.<br>
The barrier is disposed between the wire end guided out of the coil winding and the point of<br>
injection of the injection-molding compound during the injection-molding operation, so that<br>
the injection-molding compound does not encounter the wire end directly during the<br>
injection-molding operation, but, rather, is first diverted by the barrier and, after having<br>
passed the barrier, encounters the wire end in a different flow direction than in the case of a<br>
sensor without a barrier. According to advantageous embodiments of the present invention,<br>
once the injection-molding compound has solidified in the region of the wire end extending<br>
out of the coil winding, or in other words after it has passed the barrier, it has lower density<br>
than in the other regions provided with compound. According to a further advantageous<br>
embodiment, the molecular orientation of the injection-molding compound that has solidified<br>
in the region of the wire end led out of the coil winding runs predominantly perpendicular to<br>
the wire end. Experiments have shown that the materials usually used as injection-molding<br>
compounds have a smaller thermal expansion coefficient in the direction of their molecular<br>
 <br>
orientation than in other directions. Thus, the perturbing influence of the thermal expansion<br>
coefficient of the injection-molding compound can be largely compensated for by the<br>
deflection of the compound by means of the barrier.<br>
The present invention will be explained in detail hereinafter and further advantages will be<br>
pointed out on the basis of the accompanying drawings, wherein:<br>
Fig. 1	shows an embodiment of the inventive sensor in longitudinal section, and<br>
Fig. 2	shows an electric coil subassembly in side view, and<br>
Fig. 3	shows the coil subassembly according to Fig. 2 in an overhead view, and<br>
Figs. 4 to 6	show various steps during manufacture of the inventive sensor, and<br>
Figs. 7 to 9	show further embodiments of the barrier, and<br>
Fig. 10	shows a further embodiment of the inventive sensor, and<br>
Fig. 11	shows a plate-shaped barrier, and<br>
Fig. 12	shows a still further embodiment of the inventive sensor.<br>
In the figures, like reference numerals are used for corresponding parts.<br>
Fig. 1 depicts a first embodiment of the inventive sensor as a longitudinal section. The sensor<br>
is provided with an electric coil subassembly (1, 2, 3) including a coil former (2) on which<br>
there is wound an electric coil winding (1) of wire. A first and a second wire end (6, 7)<br>
extend from coil winding (1) to electric terminal points (15, 16) and are electrically connected<br>
 <br>
to these terminal points, for example by soldering or welding. Terminal points (15, 16) are<br>
electrically connected to terminal elements (17, 18) or are formed in one piece therewith.<br>
Terminal elements (17, 18) are used for connecting the sensor electrically to an electronic<br>
evaluating unit, such as the control unit of a vehicle anti-lock braking system. As an<br>
example, terminal elements (17, 18) are made of sheet-metal strips or square wire.<br>
Electric terminal points (15, 16) are disposed in a region (3) of coil former (2) that extends<br>
beyond coil winding (1) in longitudinal direction of coil subassembly (1,2, 3). In this region<br>
(3) there are also located guide elements (4, 5), which are used for fastening and guiding the<br>
wire end out of coil winding (1). Guide elements (4, 5) are preferably provided with a<br>
tangentially open guide contour for receiving the wire end. The guide contour can be formed,<br>
for example, as a lateral longitudinal slit in guide element (4, 5); so, guide elements (4, 5) can<br>
have a substantially L-shaped cross section.<br>
A permanent magnet (9) as well as a shouldered pole pin (8) of material having good<br>
magnetic conductivity are disposed inside coil subassembly (1, 2, 3). In the embodiment<br>
according to Fig. 1, pole pin (8) is disposed with its narrow end in the region surrounded by<br>
coil winding (1). The other regions of pole pin (8) as well as permanent magnet (9) are<br>
disposed outside the region surrounded by coil winding (1). By virtue of this arrangement,<br>
high efficiency or, in other words, high sensitivity of the sensor is achieved. However, the<br>
present invention is not restricted to this type of arrangement of permanent magnet and pole<br>
pin, and can also be used advantageously with other arrangements.<br>
During manufacture of the sensor, its structural elements described above are coated with an<br>
<br>
 <br>
injection-molding compound (12) in an injection-coating die described in greater detail<br>
hereinafter. A thermoplastic, especially a polyamide material, can be used as the injection-<br>
molding compound. The coated components are better protected against mechanical damage<br>
and moisture than they would be without the coating. A further increase of mechanical<br>
strength can be achieved by using compounds that are reinforced with glass beads and/or with<br>
glass fibers. A further substantial increase in mechanical stability is possible in particular by<br>
means of reinforcement with glass fibers. The injection-molding coating has the further<br>
advantage that the pole pin (8) as well as the permanent magnet (9) are fixed thereby.<br>
The coated components are disposed in a pot-like housing (13). As an example, housing (13)<br>
can be formed as a deep-drawn metal part. Housing (13) is encapsulated in moisture-proof<br>
manner by an encapsulating piece (14), which is pressed interlockingly into housing (13), and<br>
which is open at only one end. According to an alternative configuration, instead of a<br>
separate encapsulating piece (14), the space provided therefor is filled substantially with<br>
injection-molding compound (12) and a ring-shaped seal (19) between the compound and<br>
housing (13) is provided for sealing, as illustrated by the partial section in Fig. 12. In order to<br>
form the annular space for receiving seal (19) in compound (12), a complementary contour is<br>
provided in the die to be used for the injection-molding operation.<br>
Barriers (10, 11) are provided in region (3) of the coil former, and are disposed between wire<br>
end (6, 7) led out of coil winding (1) and the point of injection of compound (12) during the<br>
injection-molding operation. The arrangement and principle of action of barriers (10, 11) is<br>
discussed in greater detail hereinafter.<br>
<br>
 <br>
Fig. 2 shows coil subassembly (1, 2, 3) before the injection-molding operation has been<br>
performed but after coil winding (1) has been mounted. Compared with the sectional diagram<br>
of Fig. 1, coil subassembly (1, 2, 3) is illustrated in a view turned by one quarter of a<br>
revolution around the longitudinal axis, so that barriers (11) as well as guide element (5) are<br>
visible in overhead view. The further barrier (10) as well as the further guide element (4) are<br>
located on the back side of region (3) and for this reason are not visible in Fig. 2.<br>
Fig. 3 shows coil subassembly (1, 2, 3) according to Fig. 2 in an overhead view in the<br>
direction of region (3) of coil former (2). In this view, barriers (10, 11) conceal guide<br>
elements (4, 5), which for this reason are indicated by broken lines. As is evident, however,<br>
wire ends (6, 7) are guided in respective longitudinal slits of guide elements (4, 5). Also<br>
evident is the substantially L-shaped cross section of guide elements (4, 5).<br>
Fig. 4 illustrates coil subassembly (1, 2, 3) according to Fig. 2 after it has been introduced<br>
into an injection-molding die (40). Pole pin (8) as well as permanent magnet (9) are already<br>
located in the interior of coil former (2). Die (40) is provided with a receiving opening for<br>
coil subassembly (1,2, 3), the inside dimensions of this opening being matched to the inside<br>
dimensions of housing (13). Fig. 5 illustrates the beginning of the injection-molding<br>
operation. The liquid injection-molding compound is symbolized by arrows (50), which<br>
represent the flow direction of the compound. As is evident, barriers (10, 11) cause<br>
deflection of the flow direction of the compound, initially away from wire ends (6, 7) located<br>
behind barriers (10, 11). Behind the respective barriers, the injection-molding compound<br>
then flows in substantially perpendicular direction toward wire end (6, 7), which is routed<br>
along guide element (4, 5). The two streams of compound formed because of barriers (10,<br>
<br>
 <br>
11), at the left and right thereof, then meet one another in the region of wire end (6, 7) routed<br>
along guide element (4, 5). As a result, a lower density of the compound in the region of<br>
terminal points (15, 16) and of wire ends (6, 7) routed outside coil winding (1) can be<br>
achieved. In these regions, moreover, the molecular orientation of the injection-molding<br>
compound after solidification is predominantly perpendicular to wire ends (6, 7).<br>
Fig. 6 shows the finished subassembly with cured compound (12). This subassembly can<br>
now be removed from die (40) and disposed in housing (13).<br>
In Figs. 7 to 9, region (3) of coil former (2) is illustrated respectively in perspective partial<br>
sections. Fig. 7 shows a first embodiment of barrier (11), as was already illustrated for the<br>
sensor according to Fig. 1. The embodiment of barrier (11) according to Fig. 7 is provided<br>
with a substantially rectangular cross section having a rounded end at the outer end of barrier<br>
(11). The radius of the rounded end is preferably matched to the inside radius of housing<br>
(13).<br>
Fig. 8 shows a second embodiment of barrier (11), which compared with the embodiment<br>
according to Fig. 7 is expanded by a rib (80) oriented in longitudinal direction of coil<br>
subassembly (1, 2, 3). Rib (80) provides reinforcement of barrier (11). Furthermore, rib (80)<br>
favorably influences the course of the flow of the injection-molding compound during the<br>
injection-molding operation, to the effect that further improvement of the thermal fatigue<br>
resistance of the sensor can be achieved.<br>
The embodiment of barrier (11) according to Fig. 9 is provided with a guide contour (90) that<br>
<br>
 <br>
has radial and tangential ramps and is disposed on the side facing away from coil winding (1).<br>
Guide contour (90) produces a further improvement of the course of the flow of the<br>
injection-molding compound and, as a result, a further improvement of the thermal fatigue<br>
resistance of the sensor.<br>
It should be understood that the foregoing discussion is applicable to the other barrier (10)<br>
also.<br>
Fig. 10 illustrates a second embodiment of the inventive sensor in longitudinal section. In<br>
contrast to the embodiment according to Fig. 1, a plate-like barrier (100) is provided<br>
according to Fig. 10, instead of barriers (10, 11). As illustrated in Fig. 10, plate-like barrier<br>
(100) may be formed as a separate component, which is disposed above region (3) of coil<br>
former (2). However, barrier (100) may also be formed in one piece with coil former (2).<br>
Fig. 11 shows plate-like barrier (100) in a perspective view. Fig. 11 shows an embodiment of<br>
barrier (100) as a substantially square plate with rounded corners, wherein the corner radii are<br>
matched to the inside radius of housing (13). The inside radius of housing (13) is indicated in<br>
Fig. 11 by line (101). Barrier (100) is provided with openings (102, 103) through which<br>
terminal elements (17, 18) can be led. Also provided is a passage opening (104), through<br>
which the injection-molding compound can reach permanent magnet (9) and pole pin (8)<br>
during the injection-molding operation.<br>
During the injection-molding operation using barrier (100), the injection-molding compound<br>
flows past the outside thereof, specifically through openings (105, 106, 107, 108) between<br>
barrier (100) and die (40), these openings having the shape of segments of a circle because of<br>
<br>
 <br>
the square outside contour of barrier (100). Moreover, the injection-molding compound<br>
flows through passage opening (104) to permanent magnet (9) and pole pin (8) and fixes<br>
them.<br>
<br>
