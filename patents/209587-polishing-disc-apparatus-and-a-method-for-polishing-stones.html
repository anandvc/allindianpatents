AN APPARATUS AND A METHOD FOR POLISHING STONES Technical field<br>
The present invention relates to an apparatus and a method for polishing stones. The present invention particularly relates to an apparatus with a polishing disc equipped with central and peripheral polishing bricks for polishing stones and a hard bed to act as surface for said stones while polishing. The present invention also relates to a method of polishing stones having stepped portions and perforated edges to provide smooth, planar and polished stones with sharp edges. Background and prior art<br>
Any commercial, industrial or residential buildings have floors that are made up of stones or some other similar hard surface. Stones such as marble, Cuddapah Stones (Cuddapah is a name of a place in the State of Andhra Pradesh in India, which is famous for this type of slab stones) and granite are some examples of hard material that are commonly used for flooring. The stones used for flooring is polished either before or after laying of the stones.<br>
In a conventional way of polishing stones, a rotary abrasive tool is used to polish a rough stone by placing the stone on a polishing bed. The polishing bed basically is a sand bed made of ordinary sand and covered by a gunny bag. The polishing machine having a polishing disc is placed on the stone for polishing. The polishing discs are of smaller diameters (approximately 10 Vi inches) with lesser number of polishing surfaces or pads or bricks embedded on them. The polishing disc of a polishing machined generally comprises five polishing bricks and the diameter of the polishing disc is approximately 10.5 inches. In order to obtain polished stones, generally three types of polishing abrasive pads or bricks are used depending upon the various stages of polishing. The first type polishing bricks or pads is used for the application of rough or initial polishing coat, a second type for the application of medium polishing coat and the third type for the application of final polishing coat. Once the polishing disc is placed on the rough stone to be polished, the first stage polishing or initial stage of polishing is performed which is referred to as rough coat. After the first rough coat is performed the polishing stones or bricks or pads are changed to apply the second polish, which is generally referred to as medium coat. Thereafter, the polishing stones are changed to provide a final coat which results in a smooth surface of the stone. Subsequent to the completion of all the three coats of polishing; finally the stone is edge-cut to the required size using an edge cutting machine.<br><br>
However, by adopting the above known methods or machines it is not possible to obtain a polished stone with a perfectly levelled surface due to the uneven surface of the polishing bed, since the polishing bed is made of ordinary loose sand, which fails to maintain a perfectly levelled or planar surface not only due to the weight of the stone but also due to the continuous vibration of the machine. It is also difficult to obtain perfectly planar surfaces during polishing as resuh of the existence of unlevelled and stepped up regions on the back surface of the stones. In known methods, loose sand is used in the making of a polishing bed because loose sand held in gunny bag fills the gap of the unleveled stone back face, and thus helps to hold the stone firmly and prevents the breakage of the stone. However, the limitation is that the soft bed cannot stop the vibration of the stone. In order to prevent this vibration, if a harder plain or levelled surface is used instead of loose sand, the gap-filling on the back side of the stone will not occur and as a result the stone will vibrate even more than when used in bed made of loose sand resulting in breakage of the stone.<br>
Therefore, laying of the stones (on site) the floor is not perfectly levelled resulting in the edges of the individual stones undulating. To overcome this disadvantage, the floor has to be repolished thereby increasing the expenses. The edges of the stone after edge-cutting using the conventional method are perforated edges and are not sharp edges. This results in a wide joint, which decreases the aesthetic look of the floor.<br>

Detailed description of the invention<br>
The description of the invention is now made by referring to the accompanied<br>
diagrams. It is noted, however that the appended drawings illustrate only typical<br>
embodiment of this invention and is therefore not to be considered limiting of its<br>
scope, for the invention may admit to other equally effective embodiments.<br>
Referring initially to Fig  1, which depicts polishing apparatus of the present<br>
invention. The polishing apparatus is run by an electrical motor (2). The rotary motion<br>
of the electrical motor (2) is transmitted to the rotating shaft (8) through a pulley (3)<br>
and a V-belt (4). The height of the polishing end of the machine is adjusted by means<br><br>
of a screw (1) provided to adjust the height of the polishing apparatus. A power switch (5) is provided to control the turn-on or turn-off modes of the polishing apparatus. A handle (6) is provided to manoeuvre the polishing apparatus, to change the polishing disc and to hold the apparatus while polishing is in progress. The bottom end of the rotating shaft (8) with a hole at the center is provided for an easy flow of water and also the place to attach polishing disc. A water supply pipe (7) is provided to the apparatus to provide a constant water supply that is needed during the polishing process. A hook (9) is provided to hold the handle (6) of the polishing apparatus when the apparatus is not in use.<br>
Now by specifically referring to Figs 2 &amp; 3 in addition to Fig 1, the polishing apparatus of the present invention comprises a pair of base plates (10 &amp; 12) equipped with a plurality of housing means. The housing means are in the form of hollow cavities. Said base plates (10 &amp; 12) are operably connected to each other to form central (12) and peripheral base plates (10). A plurality of abrasive pads acting as polishing means (11) disposed within the hollow cavities of the peripheral and central base plates (10 &amp; 12). In the present invention a suitable abrasive pads or stones used are for various stages of polishing (rough and smooth). The polishing means used in the apparatus of the present invention are polishing stones selected from emery coated bricks. The polishing means (11) are in the form of polishing stones that are substantially bean-shaped. However, it is within the purview of this invention to use any such compatible shapes such as triangle-shaped polishing stones. By adopting the apparatus of the present invention, stones of type natural stone, mosaic tiles (Mosaic tiles are made of cement and pieces of natural stones) can be used for polishing. The polishing means (11) of the peripheral base plate (10) are disposed with intervening gaps. A plurality of central polishing means, similar to that of the peripheral disposed inside the hollow housing of the central base plate (12). However, the central polishing means (13) are disposed without any intervening gaps among them. The size of the base plates can be adjusted according to the size of the stone to be polished. The diameter of the base plate (10) is about 17 inches, which can be varied subject to the size of a stone. The size of the base plate depends on the required size of the stone. If the size of the stone for instance is 10" x 10", a base having plate diameter of lO'^-lOVi" is used. For a bigger size of a stone, for example, between ir'xH" to 30x30*', a base plate of diameter ranging between 10-22" is used. A hollow circular member is disposed in the middle area of the central base plate (12) to<br><br>
provide locking means. The locking means comprises a key way on the on the central base plate (12) which is lock-integrated with rotating shaft (8) of the polishing machine. Fig 3 shows the top view of the base plate (16) which is lock-integrated with the rotating shaft (8) of the polishing apparatus.<br>
Fig 4 depicts a hard bed (14) that is used in the present invention to place the stone for polishing. The hard bed (14) is a metallic frame supported by vertical legs. This hard bed (14) is of a variable size and is adjustable. The hard bed (14) disposed in proximity to the polishing disc is used to place on it the selected stone for polishing. The size and shape of the variable hard bed (14) corresponds to the size and shape of the stone to be polished. The hard bed (14) consists of height-adjusting devices (15), such as air pressure devices and screw devices. These height-adjusting devices (15) are disposed on the four comers of the hard bed (14) to suitably adjust the height of the stone so that the surface level of the stone is even. In the present invention as an exemplary embodiment screw devices are used as height adjusting devices. However, it is within the purview of this invention to use any compatible height adjusting devices including air pressure devices for the adjusting the height of the hard bed (14). However, a conventional soft bed is used for initial polishing of the stone. In another embodiment of the present invention, a hard bed for polishing stones with uneven surfaces is adopted, said hard bed comprising; a metallic frame as means for disposing the stone to be polished, a plurality of vertical legs to support the metallic frame and a plurality of height adjusting members in the form of screw devices and air pressure devices disposed on said legs to adjust the height and the surface level of the stones.<br>
The present invention also provides a method of smooth polishing of stones by using the apparatus of the present invention is disclosed. According to the method of the present invention, initially a rough stone of suitable size is selected which needs polishing. This stone (17) is first placed on the soft bed, which is a sand covered by a gunny bag (18). Most of the rough stone slabs (17) are generally not fully leveled in either the front or the back side, due to their natural occurrence. If the upper surface of the stone needs to be approximately leveled, an adjustment has to be provided at the back of the stone. Therefore a soft bed (19) is used. After placing on the soft bed initial rough polishing of the stone is done by selectively using the abrasive pads of the polishing apparatus.<br><br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the peripheral and central polishing bricks<br>
are emery coated.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention said emery coated bricks are bean-shaped or triangle-shaped, preferably bean-shaped.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention said peripheral polishing bricks are disposed with intervening gaps. In further embodiment of the present invention the soft bed is a sand covered with a<br>
gunny bag.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the size and shape of the variable hard bed corresponds to the size and shape of the stone.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention the hard bed consists of high-adjusting apparatus, preferably screws, disposed on the four comers of the hard bed to suitably adjust the height of the stone.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the size of the stone for polishing is in the range of IO"xlO"-30"x30".<br>
The present invention also provides for a method of polishing stones using the apparatus of the present invention. Initially the edge-cutting of the rough-polished stones is performed using a conventional edge-cutting machine. This edge-cutting of the rough-polished stones results in razor-sharp edges of the stone. After edge-cutting, the edge-cut and rough polished stone is placed on the hard bed (14) of the apparatus of the present invention. The hard bed (14) has height adjusting devices (15) which are preferably screws are disposed to adjust the surface level of the stone and ensure vibration free polishing of the stone. A suitable air pressure device can also used in place of screws as height adjustment devices. The hard bed (14) is a metallic frame. The size and shape of the hard bed (14) is variable and corresponds to the size and shape of the stone. After placing the stone on the hard bed (14), a medium-polishing is performed on the edge-cut and rough-polished stone. This medium-polishing results in an edge-cut and medium polished stone. Thereafter a soft-polishing is performed on the edge-cut and medium-polished stone. This soft-polishing ultimately results in a smooth, even and polished stone with sharp edges.<br>
