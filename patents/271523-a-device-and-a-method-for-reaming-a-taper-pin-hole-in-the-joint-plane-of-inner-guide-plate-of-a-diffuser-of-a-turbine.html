				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a device and method for reaming a taper pin<br>
hole in the joint plane of inner guide plate of a diffuser of a turbine.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Inner guide plate of a diffuser in the range of 210 MW to 500 MW, is one of the<br>
main component of low pressure turbine. One main turbine consists of three<br>
turbines modules, viz. high pressure turbine, intermediate pressure turbine and<br>
low pressure turbine. The low pressure turbine, like other turbines, is<br>
manufactured by fabricating it in two parts when each part is being machined<br>
separately. Facing operation of the' Joint plane face by piano milling both halves<br>
is carried out keeping necessary machining allowances. Then holes on upper half<br>
are drilled. Holes on parting flange of lower half are transfer marked from holes<br>
drilled in upper half and subsequently drilling and tapping operation are carried<br>
out. The upper half and lower half is then joined with fasteners. Reaming of<br>
taper pin holes at joint plane are then done. Dowel pins are fitted in these<br>
reamed holes to avoid dislocation of two halves during subsequent finish<br>
machining on a vertical boring machine. Because of this aspect, reamed holes<br>
are very important from quality andj accuracy of size point of view.<br>
The location of taper pin holes aie in such a position that it is not possible to<br>
carry out drilling and reaming operation on any conventional machine. As this<br>
part is of complicated design and joint plane is inside the outer ring and outside<br><br>
the inner ring of inner guide plate, the reaming operation has to be done<br>
manually by applying pressure screw technology.<br>
In the prior art, a temporary threaded piece is welded on the inner guide plate<br>
body and pressure screw is used to apply pressure during reaming using ratchet<br>
handle manually. As this temporary threaded piece is to be welded on job, it has<br>
to be shifted to another section/area for welding that results in delays. Moreover,<br>
it is very difficult to align the axis of the threaded piece and pressure screw with<br>
joint plane taper pin holes as there is no flexibility available for adjustment after<br>
welding. Hence, aligning of pin hole, reamer and pressure screw in one straight<br>
line is very difficult to achieve resulting variation in pin hole size that required<br>
enlarged or deviated taper pin. It means new pins are required to be made<br>
suiting to this holes. This obviously affects the interchangeability. Surface finish<br>
is also found to be poor. The whole process takes lot of time. Finally the welded<br>
piece is required to be removed and subsequent fettling and grinding is required<br>
to be done.<br>
Accordingly there exists a need to find a method of reaming the taper pin holes<br>
which can eliminates the disadvantages of prior art.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an object of the invention to propose a device and method for<br>
reaming taper pin holes at joint plane of inner guide plate of a diffuser of a<br>
turbine which is capable of aligning the pin hole, reamer and pressure screw in a<br>
straight line.<br><br>
Another object of invention is to propose a device and method for reaming taper<br>
pin holes at joint plane of inner guide plate of a diffuser of a turbine which is<br>
capable of producing accurate ream«d holes for required size of dowels.<br>
A still another object of the invention is to propose a device and method for<br>
reaming taper pin holes at joint plane of inner guide plate of a diffuser of a<br>
turbine which reduces the cycle time of operation.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE<br>
INVENTION<br>
Inner guide plate (1) of a diffuser in the range of 210 MW to 500 MW of a low<br>
pressure turbine is manufactured by fabrication in two parts (A,B) which are then<br>
machined to make those parts ready for assembling together by fasteners (2).<br>
First, the joint planes (C) of the two fabricated unit are faced on a piano milling<br>
as per marking by distributing machining allowances uniformly. Three holes on<br>
upper half (12) for insertion of a cylindrical stem and for reaming and for<br>
fastening are made. These holes are then marked on the lower half (13) after<br><br>
clamping the two parts properly by the fastener so that markings are not<br>
disturbed. Similar drill holes are then made on the lower half (13). Tapping of<br>
one hole for example with M48 is th«2n done. Joining of upper half and lower half<br>
is done using for example M48 fastener (2) in the tapped hole. As shown in fig.2<br>
the device (2a) consists of a stem (:$) for example of 75 mm dia milled flat for a<br>
length for example 200 mm to avoid fouling of the ratchet handle (6) during<br>
rotation manually. The total length of the stem (3) for example is 525 mm<br>
having reduced thread dia (10,11) i:or example of M20 and M36 threads at the<br>
two ends of the length of the stem (3). The sliding block (4) is for example of<br>
length 160 mm, width 60 mm and height 30 mm has a slot of width for example<br>
22 mm and length 100 mm to accommodate the threaded dia of the stem (3)<br>
and such that the threaded dia has room to be manoevured for adjustment along<br>
the length of the slot. The stem of the device is then fixed in one of the other<br>
two holes as shown in fig.l by for example M36 nut and washer. The other end<br>
of the stem (3) is fixed with a sliding block (4) assembled in slot (14). The slot<br>
(14) is for adjustment in alignmen: of pin hole (9), reamer (8) and pressure<br>
screw (5). The sliding block (4) has a threaded hole (13) above the slot (14) for<br>
the provision of a pressure screw (5). This sliding block (4) can be aligned with<br>
pin hole axis very easily and manual reaming can be done with a reamer (8) and<br>
ratchet handle (6) while pressure screw (5) fixed in the threaded hole (15) giving<br>
a constant pressure on the reamer provides a constant support and alignment.<br>
As shown in fig (2) the device (2a) has a built in sliding block (4) that can be<br>
adjusted as per requirement and p'oper alignment of the reamer (8) with the<br>
pressure screw (5) and the hole (9) to be reamed is ensured. Since the taper pin<br>
hole location (9), reamer (8) and pressure screw (5) are all in one line, an<br>
accurate hole (9) with required quality and surface finish is achieved. This<br>
process gives no scope for any devicition in hole size and shape. Time and labour<br>
taken by this process is very less compared to earlier one. Earlier the two units<br>
used to be joined by fasteners while in the present invention, using a stem (3) in<br>
place of one of the fasteners alorg with sliding block (4) has enhanced the<br><br>
quality of the hand reaming operaton. The cylindrical stem (3) and the sliding<br>
block (4) has given the process much rigidity and scope of adjustment for<br>
alignment. After the reamed hole being produced as per drawing, the taper<br>
dowel pins are fitted in the hole to make the unit ready for final finish machining<br>
on a vertical boring machine. As the device (2a) is clamped with the job, it gives<br>
high degree of rigidity. For producing the reamed taper pin hole (9), the device<br>
(2a) is placed in position with the stem (3) locked on the body at the joint face<br>
by a nut (7) in one side and clamped with the sliding block (4) on the other side<br>
after passing through a slot (14) on the block (4). The reamer (8) is placed on<br>
the drilled hole (9) to be reamed ensuring the correct alignment with the<br>
pressure screw (5) engaged with the reamer when a continuous pressure is<br>
applied on the shank of the reamer (8) during reaming operation providing a<br>
constant support to the reamer (8), The rachet handle (6) holds the reamer (8)<br>
and is rotated to give a rotational motion to the reamer (8) inside the drilled hole<br>
(9) to produce finally the reamed taper pin hole of required size and finish.<br><br>
