CONTROL APPARATUS OF GENERATOR FOR VEHICLE;<br>
SUZUKI MOTOR CORPORATION, A CORPORATION ORGANIZED AND EXISTING UNDER THE LAWS OF JAPAN, WHOSE ADDRESS IS 300, TAKATSUKA-CHO, MINAMI-KU, HAMAMATSU-SHI, SHIZUOKA-KEN, JAPAN.<br><br>
THE	FOLLOWING	SPECIFICATION<br>
PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br><br><br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The invention relates to a control apparatus of a power generator for a vehicle and, more particularly, to a control apparatus of a generator for a vehicle, in which a charge/discharge current of a battery which is charged by the generator is properly managed and a fuel consumption amount of the vehicle having an engine for driving the generator is reduced.<br>
Prior Art<br>
As a vehicle, there is a vehicle having a control apparatus of a generator for the vehicle, having: the generator (alternator) which is driven by a mounted engine; a battery which is charged by the generator; and current detecting means for detecting a charge/discharge current of the battery, wherein a generation voltage of the generator is controlled on the basis of a value of the detected charge/discharge current. According to the control apparatus of the generator for the vehicle, the generation voltage of the generator is controlled to an adjustment voltage by a regulator provided for the generator and electric powers are properly supplied to various kinds of electric loads, thereby properly charging the battery.<br>
According to JP-A-2006-94662 (Patent Document 1), there is a control apparatus for controlling the generator by using the alternator having the regulator which can vary the adjustment voltage. According to the control by the control apparatus, an operating mode of the vehicle is distinguished and the adjustment voltage of the regulator is set in accordance with the operating mode. The operating mode in the control apparatus denotes a state upon idling and a state upon normal running other than the idling. As exceptional processes for a relation between the operating mode and the adjustment voltage, conditions such as power generating ratio, engine rotational speed, and the like are provided. As such a type of control apparatus, a control apparatus which executes the forced power generating operation upon deceleration called a multi-regenerative power generation has also been proposed.<br><br>
Patent No. 3250261 (Patent Document 2) describes a control apparatus in which current control is made only upon idling and voltage control is made upon running, thereby preventing an over-charge of the battery.<br>
According to JP-A-2007-074815 (Patent Document 3), there is a control apparatus in which an adjustment voltage is adjusted based on a battery temperature from a viewpoint of battery protection.<br>
According to the Patent Documents 1 to 3 cited above and JP-A-2002-354704 (Patent Document 4), the control is made mainly to prevent the over-charge of the battery. As such a kind of control apparatus of the generator for the vehicle, a control apparatus in which management of the charge and discharge is made in order to obtain a fuel economy effect for the purpose of preventing the over-charge has also been proposed.<br>
Furthermore, as a control apparatus of the generator for the vehicle in the related art, there is a control apparatus in which an adjustment voltage of a regulator is switched to the two high and low levels and a control voltage is controlled at the two stages (refer to Fig. 17).<br>
According to the control apparatus of the generator for the vehicle disclosed in each of JP-A-2004-274842 (Patent Document 5) and JP-A-2005-348526 (Patent Document 6), there is such a problem that when the adjustment voltage of the regulator is switched to the low voltage side, charges corresponding to an amount of an electric load which is used in the vehicle are discharged as they are, so that there is a risk that a load on the battery increases, and such a countermeasure as to stop the control is necessary in dependence on the amount of the electric load.<br>
On the other hand, similar control can be also made even by the method whereby the adjustment voltage of the regulator is continuously varied like a control apparatus of the generator for the vehicle disclosed in each of Patent Documents 1 to 4. However, even if the adjustment voltage is merely instructed, whether the battery is actually charged or discharged is unclear. There is such a problem that even if the correction by the temperature or the like is made, how the battery acts is not certainly recognized.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An objective of the invention is to realize control of a generator which is not influenced by an electric load amount or a charge state of a battery.<br>
Another objective of the invention is to reduce a fuel consumption amount without setting the battery into an over-charge state.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a control apparatus of a generator for a vehicle, comprising: the generator; a battery which is charged by the generator; and current detecting means for detecting a charge/discharge current of the battery, wherein the control apparatus further has voltage control means for setting a different target charge/discharge current value every running condition of the vehicle, setting a feedback correction value according to a difference between a value of the target charge/discharge current and a value of the charge/discharge current detected by the current detecting means, and controlling a generation voltage of the generator in accordance with the feedback correction value.<br>
According to the control apparatus of the generator for the vehicle of the invention, since the target charge/discharge current value is set every running condition and the generation voltage of the generator is controlled so as to obtain the target charge/discharge current value, the control of the generator which is not influenced by the electric load amount or the charge state of the battery can be realized.<br>
Thus, according to the control apparatus of" the generator for the vehicle of the invention, the power generation amount suppressing control for reducing the fuel consumption amount without setting the battery into the over-charge state can be realized.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
In Fig. 1, a control apparatus 1 of a generator for a vehicle has: an alternator 2 as a generator which is driven by an engine of the vehicle and generates an electric power; a battery 3 as a storage battery which is charged by the alternator 2; and voltage control means 4. In the control apparatus 1, an output terminal of the alternator 2 is connected to a plus (+) terminal 6 of the battery 3 by a first power line 5. A second power line 7 branched from a middle point of the first power line 5 is connected to the voltage control means 4. A minus (-) terminal 8 of the battery 3 is connected to the ground by a third power line 9.<br>
A first fuse 10, an ignition switch 11, and a second fuse 12 are sequentially arranged on the second power line 7 branched from the first power line 5 in the direction from the battery 3 side toward the voltage control means 4 side. An electric load 14 is connected to the second power line 7 between the first fuse 10 and the ignition switch 11 by a fourth power line 13. A starter motor 16 is connected to the second power line 7 between the second fuse 12 and the voltage control means 4 by a fifth power line 15.<br>
The alternator 2 has: a regulator 17 which can vary an adjustment voltage; a C terminal 18 to which an instruction signal of the adjustment voltage is inputted; and an FR terminal 19 from which a signal indicative of a ratio of the present power generation amount to the maximum power generation amount of the alternator 2 is outputted. The C terminal 18 is connected to the voltage control means 4 by a first signal line 20. The FR terminal 19 is connected to the voltage control means 4 by a second signal line 21.<br>
The battery 3 is provided with: a battery temperature sensor 22 for detecting a temperature of the battery 3; an a current sensor 23 as current detecting means for<br><br>
detecting the charge/discharge current of the battery 3. The battery temperature sensor 22 is connected to the voltage control means 4 by a third signal line 24. The battery temperature sensor 22 is provided for the purpose of monitoring the battery temperature so that the discharging operation of the battery 3 is not executed in a temperature environment in which current receiving performance deteriorates. The current sensor 23 is connected to the voltage control means 4 by a fourth signal line 25. The current sensor 23 is provided for the third power line 9 connected to the minus (-) terminal 8 of the battery 3 in order to manage the charge and discharge of the battery 3.<br>
Various kinds of sensors 26 for controlling the engine are connected to the voltage control means 4 by a fifth signal line 27. Various kinds of switches 28 for controlling the engine are connected to the voltage control means 4 by a sixth signal line 29. Another signal unit 30 for controlling the engine is connected to the voltage control means 4 by a seventh signal line 31.<br>
As various sensors 26, for example, there are a water temperature sensor of the engine, an intake air temperature sensor, and an intake pressure sensor and engine information is inputted to the voltage control means 4 from those sensors. The various switches 28 are electric load switches (ELSW). As electric load switches, for example, there are a light switch, a blower switch, a rear defogger switch, a seat heater switch, a power window switch, and the tike. Information of the electric load which can be operated by the user is inputted from those switches.<br>
As another signal unit 30, there are an acceleration pedal opening degree sensor and a throttle valve opening degree sensor. If an idle switch is formed in a software manner by information which is inputted from the acceleration pedal opening degree sensor and the throttle valve opening degree sensor, detection signals of those sensors are used. When there is actually an input of an idle switch signal, its input signal is used.<br>
A crank angle sensor and a cam angle sensor are also included in the another signal unit 30 because the voltage control means 4 uses information of an engine rotational speed.<br>
Further, since the voltage control means 4 uses information of a vehicle speed, a shift range, and a brake switch, component parts (vehicle speed sensor and the like)<br><br>
regarding them are also similarly included in the another signal unit 30. The information of the brake switch is used as a will of deceleration (absence of brake pedal depression = coasting: do not want to decelerate, presence of brake pedal depression = deceleration: there is a will to stop).<br>
If the above information is derived from an external controller, its communication (CAN, LIN, various kinds of serial communication, and the like) is also included as a target in the another signal unit 30.<br>
As voltage information which is used by the voltage control means 4, one of a terminal voltage of the battery 3, an input voltage of the voltage control means 4, and an output terminal voltage of the alternator 2 is selected. If the terminal voltage of the battery 3 is selected as voltage information, since a power line (second power line 7) is directly connected to the voltage control means 4, a protecting relay which is activated in an interlocking relational manner with the main relay (ignition switch 11) is added. The voltage information can be used as it is.<br>
When the input voltage which is supplied to the voltage control means 4 is used as voltage information, since the voltage control means 4 is connected to the downstream side of a branch point from the battery 3 to the various electric loads 14, there is a case where the input voltage does not indicate the actual battery voltage information. In the case of using the input voltage as voltage information, there is a possibility that a voltage drop allowance due to wirings changes depending on a magnitude of a current flowing on the wirings although the apparatus is reasonable because there are no surplus additional parts and lines.<br>
Although there is such a problem that when there is a large electric load and the voltage drop increases, a deviation between the battery voltage and the control voltage increases, a correction of such a deviation will be described hereinafter.<br>
In the case of using the voltage of the alternator 2, it is desirable that the alternator 2 itself has such a function and if communication can be made, its information is used. Although dedicated voltage wirings can be also provided, in such a case, it is preferable to use a construction in which the protecting relay is provided in a manner similar to the case of using the terminal voltage of the battery 3.<br><br>
The voltage control means 4 receives the information from the battery temperature sensor 22, current sensor 23, various sensors 26, various switches 28, and another signal unit 30 and outputs a duty signal to the C terminal 18 (port for instructing the adjustment voltage) of the alternator 2. The alternator 2 which received the duty signal outputs the adjustment voltage which has been preset in a circuit of the regulator 17 in correspondence to a duty. The regulator 17 controls the generation voltage of the alternator 2 to the adjustment voltage.<br>
The control apparatus 1 of the generator for the vehicle has: the alternator 2 which is driven by the engine; the battery 3 which is charged by the alternator 2; and the current sensor 23 detecting the charge/discharge current of the battery 3. By the voltage control means 4, the different target charge/discharge current value is set every running condition (running mode) of the vehicle, the feedback correction value is set according to a difference between the target charge/discharge current value and a value of the charge/discharge current detected by the current detecting means, and the generation voltage of the alternator 2 is controlled to the adjustment voltage in accordance with the feedback correction value so that the value of the charge/discharge current detected by the current sensor 23 is equal to target charge/discharge current value.<br>
When the running mode is the power generation cutting mode upon running, the voltage control means 4 sets the target charge/discharge current value to such a value that the charge/discharge state of the battery 3 is controlled in the discharging direction as compared with that in the normal control mode<br>
Upon execution of a power generation cutting mode upon running, when an accumulation discharge amount exceeds a set value, th£ voltage control means 4 stops the execution.<br>
Further, when the running mode is a charge suppressing mode upon idling and a charge suppressing mode upon running, the voltage control means 4 sets the target charge/discharge current value to such a value that a charge/discharge state of the battery is controlled in a discharging direction as compared with that in a normal mode and that the charge/discharge state of the battery is controlled in a charging direction as compared with that in the power generation cutting mode upon running.<br><br>
Moreover, the voltage control means 4 is set so that it can preferentially execute the mode in order of the power generation cutting mode upon running, the charge suppressing mode upon idling, the charge suppressing mode upon running, the regenerating mode, and the normal mode.<br>
Subsequently, the operation of the embodiment will be described.<br>
In the control apparatus 1 of the generator for the vehicle, the charge/discharge current of the battery 3 is detected (monitored) by the current sensor 23 and the adjustment voltage of the regulator 17 provided for the alternator 2 is feedback controlled for the target charge/discharge current value allocated to each specified running condition (running mode).<br>
First, the control apparatus 1 inputs the target charge/discharge current value and adjusts the adjustment voltage of the regulator 17 while monitoring the charge/discharge current value detected by the current sensor 23 so that it is converged to the target value. Thus, upon discharging (power generation cutting mode upon running), the control apparatus 1 can assure a predetermined discharge amount without being influenced by the electric load 14. In the case where the user wants to suppress the charge as in the idling (charge suppressing mode upon idling), the control apparatus 1 can certainly feedback control the voltage to a power generation voltage in which the charge/discharge current does not actually exist.<br>
Consequently, the control apparatus 1 can obtain a predetermined fuel economy effect without being influenced by the state of the electric load 14 or the battery 3 and can prevent an over-discharge of the battery 3.<br>
The control apparatus 1 of the generator for the vehicle classifies the running mode as a running condition of the vehicle into five modes and sets them as shown in Fig. 2.<br>
(1) Power generation cutting mode upon running in which a large target discharge is set in a mode in which the time is limited like a state of a starting acceleration or a state during the acceleration.<br><br>
(2)	Charge suppressing mode upon idling in which it is difficult to predict an end time<br>
like a state of the idling operation or the like (as compared with the case of the starting<br>
acceleration or the case during the acceleration).<br>
(3)	Regenerating mode in which a forced charge is performed in order to cut a<br>
deceleration fuel.<br>
(4)	Charge suppressing mode upon running in which the charge to the battery 3 is also suppressed in a state where an off-idle state is held even after the power generation cutting mode upon running was continued for a predetermined time.<br>
(5)	Another normal (non-control) mode<br>
In the above five running modes, as shown in Fig. 2, a target charge/discharge current, a target charge/discharge voltage, and a priority are set every mode. The priority denotes that the mode having the high priority is preferentially activated. In Fig. 2, for example, when the control of the charge suppressing mode upon idling having the priority 2 is made, if the control of the power generation cutting mode upon running having the priority 1 is activated, the control of the charge suppressing mode upon idling is finished in order to preferentially make the control of the power generation cutting mode upon running. A power generating efficiency in the running mode of each of the power generation cutting mode upon running, charge suppressing mode upon idling, and regenerating mode is lower than that in the normal mode.<br>
In Fig. 2, the target charge/discharge current (0 + a) in the charge suppressing mode upon idling denotes that 0 ampere is set as a basic value in the charge suppressing mode upon idling and in the discharging direction, a slight amount of current is permitted. The target charge/discharge current (0 - p) in the charge suppressing mode upon running denotes that 0 ampere is set as a basic value in the charge suppressing mode upon running and in the charging direction, a slight amount of current is permitted.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, the voltage control means 4 shifts the running mode on the basis of the FR information, the battery current, the engine information including a vehicle speed, an engine rotational speed, a water temperature, an intake air temperature, on/off states of the electric load switches, and the like, the battery<br><br>
temperature, and the battery voltage.   In Fig. 3, the values of the voltage and current written are reference values and an a value and a p value are arbitrary constants.<br>
The voltage control means 4 controls so as to shift the running mode as follows. That is, in the power generation cutting mode upon running, when a time-out occurs (a control time exceeds a set time) in the on state of the acceleration, the running mode is shifted to the charge suppressing mode upon running. When the time-out occurs (the control time exceeds the set time) or the acceleration is OFF, the mode is shifted to the normal mode. When the throttle valve is OFF and the fuel cut upon deceleration occurs, the mode is shifted to the regenerating mode.<br>
The voltage control means 4 controls so as to shift the running mode as follows. That is, in the charge suppressing mode upon idling, when the throttle valve is turned on and a timer is in a valid state (the control time lies within the set time), the running mode is shifted to the power generation cutting mode upon running. When a shift range changes from D to N (D -* N) and the vehicle speed rises, the mode is shifted to the normal mode.<br>
The voltage control means 4 controls so as to shift the running mode as follows. That is, in the regenerating mode, when the fuel cut is finished, the running mode is shifted to the normal mode. When the operation is shifted to the idle state, the mode is shifted to the charge suppressing mode upon idling. When the throttle valve is turned on and the timer is in the valid state (the control time lies within the set time), the mode is shifted to the power generation cutting mode upon running and is shifted to the charge suppressing mode upon running.<br>
The voltage control means 4 controls so as to shift the running mode as follows. That is, in the charge suppressing mode upon running, when the time-out occurs (the control time exceeds the set time) or when the vehicle speed decreases to the set value or less, the running mode is shifted to the normal mode and is shifted to the regenerating mode.<br>
The voltage control means 4 controls so as to shift the running mode as follows. That is, in the normal mode, When the throttle valve is turned on and the timer is in the valid state (the control time lies within the set time), the running mode is shifted to the<br><br>
power generation cutting mode upon running. When the operation is shifted to the idle state, the mode is shifted to the charge suppressing mode upon idling.<br>
Among the above five running modes, the power generation cutting mode upon running, the charge suppressing mode upon idling, and the charge suppressing mode upon running are used by selecting at least one or more of the following prerequisite conditions (1)to (9).<br>
(1) Inputs/outputs (including communication) which are used in the control are normal.<br>
(2) A time necessary to collect a starting current has already elapsed.<br>
An object of this condition is set in order to make the operations accompanied with the discharge independent, respectively. Thus, an influence on the control apparatus 1 by the starting discharge can be reduced (however, when the time has passed, even if the discharged current is not fully collected, the control is enabled).<br>
The starting current is very large and if it is intended to actually measure the starting current by the ordinary current sensor, it is necessary to switch the range to the normal range. In the case of the switchable current sensor, after the collection was confirmed, this condition may be skipped.<br>
In the case of using a method whereby the starting current is obtained based on experiment values (the starting current at each engine water temperature is preliminarily decided), even when the discharged current has been collected by the charge current of the current sensor 23, the above condition may be skipped.<br>
(3)	A forced charging time after the start has already elapsed.<br>
By instructing the user to charge for a predetermined period of time from the start before the discharge is started, a risk of discharge can be reduced.<br>
(4)	The water temperature of the engine lies within a proper range.<br>
As indirect information, the water temperature information in the control can be substituted for the battery temperature. Even if the water temperature lies within the proper range, the battery temperature does not always lie within a proper range. Therefore, by combining it with, for example, the intake air temperature, an outside air<br><br>
temperature (in this case, battery temperature) presuming logic as disclosed in JP-A-2005-016466 filed by the same applicant of the present invention may be developed.<br>
In high load and heat harmful conditions, a limitation may be added lest a voltage fluctuation exerts an influence on another system.<br>
(5)	The intake air temperature of the engine lies within a proper range.<br>
Since the intake air temperature is environment information in a manner similar to the case where the water temperature is the engine information, the intake air temperature is information which can take a rapid countermeasure as compared with the factor such as battery (liquid) temperature or (engine) water temperature in which a specific heat is also high and a response speed is low.<br>
A damage to the battery 3 by a temperature change due to a sudden decrease in atmospheric temperature (change in weather, change in elevation above sea level by the mountain climbing) can be reduced.<br>
(6)	Electric load switch (ELSW) conditions are OFF.<br>
In this control, although the magnitude of the electric load does not exert an influence on the discharge amount, in the case of the light, blower, and the like, there is a possibility that unpleasant flickering or sound quality change is given to the user by a voltage change. Therefore, this control is not made in a state where the light or blower is ON (electric load switch conditions are ON).<br>
(7)	The discharge amount lies within a proper range.<br>
This condition is provided in order to prevent the over-discharge, that is, to assure the starting performance. In order to prevent the over-discharge of the battery 3, the discharge amount is managed and whether or not its value is proper is discriminated. (Discharge amount management)<br>
(8)	The vehicle speed lies within a proper range.<br>
As a using method of the vehicle speed, a region excluding a racing at a high vehicle speed and during the stop of the vehicle is a target region. When the vehicle speed is out of the proper range, the high speed side, that is, a situation where the<br><br>
vehicle is cruising, a situation where the vehicle is running at a high load, or the like is presumed. In such a situation, the average engine rotational speed is also high, it is suitable for collection, and a situation where the vehicle uses a large amount of fuel at the high load is also presumed. A situation where the vehicle cannot run in a fuel economy mode or the like is presumed. Therefore, such a case is a exceptional target region.<br>
(9) The battery temperature lies within a proper range.<br>
The battery temperature is a parameter regarding the current receiving performance of the battery 3. When the battery temperature is out of this range, it is presumed that it is difficult to collect the discharged current.<br>
With respect to the condition (7) "The discharge amount ties within a proper range (discharge amount management)" as one of the above prerequisite conditions, it is managed as shown in Fig. 4. When the discharge amount is assumed to be ZDCHG, the discharge amount can be obtained by the following equation.<br>
ZDCHG - max (lower limit value, initial value ZDCHGO<br>
+ accumulation current amount 2DCHGCUL<br>
+ starting discharge current ZDCRK)<br>
The initial value ZDCHGO is set as follows.<br>
•	When the battery 3 is connected, the discharge amount is initialized to a certain fixed value.<br>
•	When the ignition switch 11 is ON, ZDCHGO is set to 0 (ZDCHGO = 0) in the cases other than the case where specific conditions are satisfied.<br>
The accumulation current amount ZDCHGCUL is calculated by the following calculating method.<br>
(1) ZDCHG &gt; lower limit value XDCHGMIN<br>
(for example: lower limit value = -1%)<br><br>
When the discharge amount ZDCHG is located on the discharge side than the lower limit value (1%), the accumulation current amount is calculated by accumulating the charge/discharge current detected by the current sensor 23 to the previous accumulation value.<br>
(-1%) denotes that the current amount corresponding to 1% of a battery capacitance has been accumulated to the initial value toward the charge side. A minus sign indicates the charging direction.<br>
(2)	ZDCHG 
The value obtained when the discharge amount has reached the lower limit value is maintained.<br>
(3)	ZDCHG &gt; upper limit value XDCHGMAX<br>
(for example: upper limit value = +1%)<br>
When the discharge amount exceeds the upper limit value, the power generation cutting mode upon running is inhibited. However, the accumulation of the discharge amount is continued.<br>
This is because since the state on the discharge side is one of permission/inhibition requirements for discriminating whether or not the power generation cutting mode upon running is executed, the accurate value is necessary.<br>
(+1%) denotes that the current amount corresponding to 1% of the battery capacitance has been accumulated to the initial value toward the discharge side. A plus sign indicates the discharging direction.<br>
The starting discharge current ZDCRK is set as follows.<br>
•	The current value which is added per one time of the engine start after the starting was finished.<br>
•	The current value is corrected according to the starting water temperature.<br>
Subsequently, the control will be described.<br><br>
First, the control of the power generation cutting mode upon running, the charge suppressing mode upon idling, and the charge suppressing mode upon running among the above five running modes will be described.<br>
The activating and finishing conditions of the power generation cutting mode upon running are set as follows.<br>
•	Activating conditions<br>
(1) All of the items selected as conditions among the foregoing prerequisite conditions<br>
(1)	to (9) are satisfied.<br>
(2)	As a trigger condition, an opening degree of an acceleration pedal changes from a state less than a predetermined opening degree to the predetermined opening degree or more. (An electric throttle valve or the like may be used as a throttle valve condition. If the apparatus is equipped with an electric throttle system, a signal on the throttle valve side may be used.)<br>
(3)	A predetermined time or longer has elapsed from the end of the previous control. (Continuous input prevention)<br>
•	Finishing conditions<br>
(1)	One of the prerequisite conditions is satisfied.<br>
(2)	The control was continued for a predetermined time. (Time out)<br>
(3)	A predetermined time or longer does not elapse from the end of the previous<br>
control.<br>
The activating and finishing conditions of the charge suppressing mode upon idling are set as follows.<br>
•	Activating conditions<br>
(1) All of the items selected as conditions among the foregoing prerequisite conditions (1) to (9) are satisfied.<br><br>
(2) [Selecting conditions] This mode is activated under the idle switch condition or the vehicle speed condition (vehicle speed = 0 is certainly contained and an upper limit is set). (When the vehicle speed condition is selected, the idle switch condition is unnecessary.)<br>
•	Finishing conditions<br>
(1)	The activating conditions are not satisfied.<br>
(2)	The power generation cutting mode upon running is activated. (In the case of<br>
using the vehicle speed condition, since the speed condition overlaps with that of the<br>
power generation cutting mode upon running, a priority is allocated.)<br>
The activating and finishing conditions of the charge suppressing mode upon running are set as follows.<br>
•	Activating conditions<br>
(1) The case where the power generation cutting mode upon running is finished without being shifted to the charge suppressing mode upon idling or the regenerating mode. (State where the time-out of the power generation cutting mode upon running has occurred in the acceleration ON state.)<br>
•	Finishing conditions<br>
(1)	The power generation cutting mode upon running, charge suppressing mode upon<br>
idling, and regenerating mode are satisfied.<br>
(2)	The charge suppressing mode upon running has elapsed for a predetermined<br>
time. (Time-out)<br>
(3)	The vehicle speed decreases. (In a situation where the acceleration is ON and the<br>
vehicle speed is low, when the "selecting condition" in the activating conditions of the<br>
charge suppressing mode upon idling is the vehicle speed, the mode is shifted to the<br>
charge suppressing mode upon idling in association with the decrease in vehicle speed.<br>
When the idle switch is selected as "selecting condition", the mode is shifted to the<br>
normal mode.)<br><br>
The control of each of the power generation cutting mode upon running, the charge suppressing mode upon idling, and the charge suppressing mode upon running has a common control flow as shown in Fig. 5.<br>
In Fig. 5, when the control is started in the power generation cutting mode upon running, the charge suppressing mode upon idling, or the charge suppressing mode upon running (step 100), a duty output CDUTY for instructing the adjustment voltage which is inputted to the C terminal 18 of the alternator 2 is set to an initial value (102). Whether or not an initial adjustment voltage holding time has elapsed is discnminated (104).<br>
If NO in the discrimination (104), the counting of the initial adjustment voltage holding time is continued. If YES in the discrimination (104), feedback control is made (106).<br>
In the feedback control (106), a duty output CDUTY(n) is obtained by the following equations.<br>
CDUTY(n) = CLIP (upper limit value, CDUTY(n-l) +<br>
gradual excitation amount KCDUTY,<br>
lower limit value) KCDUTY = proportional gain GCDUTY * feedback deviation<br>
correction coefficient T_GAIN_P (current<br>
difference Al) Al = charge/discharge current measurement value<br>
- instruction center current ICNTR<br>
(+ side denotes the discharge)<br>
The obtained duty output CDUTY(n) is inputted to the C terminal 18 of the alternator 2. The adjustment voltage of the regulator 17 is feedback controlled to the instruction center current (target charge/discharge current value).<br><br>
Whether or not the mode conditions are maintained during the feedback control (106) is discriminated (108). If YES in this discrimination (108), the feedback control according to the present control mode is continued. If NO in this discrimination (108), the present control mode is finished (110). After completion of the present control mode, the mode is shifted to another control mode according to the conditions.<br>
The expression in the flowchart of Fig. 5,<br>
CLIP (upper limit value, CDUTY(n-l) + gradual<br>
excitation amount KCDUTY, lower limit value)<br>
denotes that the following processes are executed. That is.<br>
(1)	When CDUTY(n-l) + gradual excitation amount KCDUTY<br>
&gt; upper limit value, - upper limit value<br>
(2)	When lower limit value 
excitation amount KCDUTY 
→ CDUTY(n-l) + gradual excitation amount KCDUTY<br>
(3)	When CDUTY(n-l) + gradual excitation amount KCDUTY<br>
The gradual excitation amount is a component adapted to gradually increase/decrease the power generation amount of the alternator 2.<br>
The proportional gain GCDUTY in the equation in the flowchart of Fig. 5 is set, for example, as follows.<br>
The proportional gain GCDUTY is obtained by the following equation.<br>
The gradual excitation amount KCDUTY = proportional gain<br>
GCDUTY * feedback deviation correction<br><br>
coefficient T GAIN P<br>
Although the proportional gain GCDUTY is a constant, the feedback deviation correction coefficient T_GAIM_P is expressed as a table having a dead zone. As shown in Figs. 6 and 7, the feedback deviation correction coefficient T_GAIN_P is set in such a manner that, for example, a difference (Al = ±2A) between the actual current and the target charge/discharge current is set to the dead zone and a value on the charge side and a value on the discharge side are obtained so as to sandwich the dead zone.<br>
A method of setting the feedback deviation correction coefficient is not limited to that shown in Fig. 6 but, for example, the feedback is separated into ascent and descent and individual tables as shown by the following expressions may be formed. In this case, each portion corresponding to the dead zone is set to a feedback end threshold value.<br>
•	If Al &gt; 2A, KCDUTY(+) = gradual excitation amount on the ascent side, KCDUTY(-) = 0<br>
•	If Al 
•	In other cases, the present value is maintained.<br>
As shown in the right side portion in Fig. 8, the target charge/discharge current in the power generation cutting mode upon running is set to a position (10 [A]) for the purpose of discharging. In the power generation cutting mode upon running, the adjustment voltage of the regulator 17 is adjusted so that the discharge amount of a predetermined value can be assured (without being influenced by the electric load amount). When the target charge/discharge current is set to about a loadless current (for example, 10A), the actual current, Al (current difference), feedback deviation correction coefficient, and a tendency of CDUTY are as shown in Fig. 9.<br>
In order to suppress the charge to the battery 3, the target charge/discharge current in each of the charge suppressing mode upon idling and the charge suppressing mode upon running is set to a target current around 0 [A] as a center as shown in a<br><br>
center portion in Fig. 8. In the charge suppressing mode upon idling and the charge suppressing mode upon running, the voltage is adjusted to the adjustment voltage of the regulator 17 so that the target charge/discharge current = 0 [A] in order to suppress the charge (improve the fuel economy). When the target charge/discharge current is set to 0 [A], the actual current, Al (current difference), feedback deviation correction coefficient, and tendency of CDUTY are as shown in Fig. 10.<br>
Subsequently, the control of the regenerating mode among the above five running modes will be described.<br>
The activating and finishing conditions of the regenerating mode are set as follows.<br>
•	Activating conditions<br>
(1)	The power generation cutting mode upon running and the charge suppressing mode upon idling are not activated. (It is specified so that the priority condition of the charge suppressing mode upon running is lower than that of the regenerating mode.)<br>
(2)	Fuel cut upon deceleration. (A delay time may be included after the mode was recovered from the fuel cut.)<br>
•	Finishing condition<br>
(1) The activating conditions are not satisfied.<br>
Brake conditions are added and the regenerating mode is branched into a voluntary regeneration (strong regeneration) and an involuntary regeneration (weak regeneration) as follows.<br>
•	Branching conditions of the weak regeneration<br>
(1) After the regeneration activating conditions were satisfied, a brake is never turned on.<br>
•	Branching conditions of the strong regeneration<br>
(1) Other than the branching conditions of the weak regeneration mentioned above<br><br>
When the regenerating mode was once set into the strong regeneration, it is not returned to the weak regeneration. This is because it is necessary not to execute the sudden power generation so that the deceleration which the user does not intend is not performed and, at the same time, if it becomes necessary to accelerate again due to a decrease in coasting time, there is a possibility that it becomes a negative factor as a fuel economy effect.<br>
In the regenerating mode, the present duty output is obtained on the basis of the proportional gain in the regenerating mode, the feedback deviation correction coefficient, and a full-open duty output. The obtained duty output is inputted to the C terminal 18 of the alternator 2 and the adjustment voltage of the regulator 17 is feedback controlled for the target charge/discharge current value.<br>
At the time of the strong regeneration, the feedback control can be also used in order to limit the current. For example, in order to use the target charge/discharge current as a limitation current, as shown in a left side portion in Fig. 8, by giving the target charge/discharge current of, for example, -30 [A] (minus denotes the charge side), the control of the regenerating mode can be handled in a manner similar to the foregoing three types of control (the power generation cutting mode upon running, the charge suppressing mode upon idling, and the charge suppressing mode upon running). When the target charge/discharge current is set to about the loadless current (for example, -30A), the actual current, Al (current difference), feedback deviation correction coefficient, and tendency of CDUTY are as shown in Fig. 11.<br>
However, an initial value, a holding time of the initial value, and the like are unnecessary and a gain adapted to realize the short-time collection is set as shown in Figs. 12 and 13. As shown in Figs. 12 and 13, the feedback deviation correction coefficient T_GAIN_P is set in such a manner that, for example, when the difference between the actual current and the target charge/discharge current is equal to or less than -30A (Al = -30A or (ess), the adjustment voltage is limited and, when it is equal to or more than -20A, the adjustment voltage is raised.<br>
Further, the control of the normal mode among the above five running modes will be described.<br>
The normal mode indicates the following states.<br><br>
(1)	A high-rotating state where the power generating efficiency is high, a high-vehicle-speed state in which a possibility that the vehicle cruises is high, and a state where it is an object to collect the starting current and to maintain starting performance and it is a main object to charge the battery from a viewpoint of battery protection.<br>
(2)	Non-control state due to various kinds of abnormal stages.<br>
The normal mode indicates states other than the foregoing four modes from a moment when the ignition switch 11 has been turned on. Among those states, the normal mode is classified into several states. When the normal mode is regarded as a mode in a state where the power generation control is inoperative, the normal mode is classified into a state where the ignition switch 11 is ON, a state where the engine is started, and a state where the power generation control is inoperative (the engine is operating) and is controlled as follows.<br>
(1)	The ignition switch 11 is turned on. (engine stop)<br>
The initial value of CDUTY is given and the gradual exciting operation is not executed.<br>
(2)	When the engine is started.<br>
The initial value of CDUTY is allocated again according to the water temperature upon starting. When the water temperature sensor detects an abnormal state, the initial value given upon turn-on of the ignition switch 11 is used.<br>
(3)	When the engine is operating. (Modes other than the above four modes)<br>
Only in the control of the normal mode, the gradual exciting operation is executed toward the target "voltage".<br>
As mentioned above, the control apparatus 1 of the generator for the vehicle sets the target charge/discharge current value every running made and controls the duty output CDUTY to the C terminal 18 of the alternator 2 so as to obtain the target charge/discharge current value while monitoring the charge/discharge current value detected by the current sensor 23, thereby duty controlling the adjustment voltage of the regulator 17.   The CDUTY value is obtained by adding the gradual excitation amount<br><br>
KCDUTY to the previous CDUTY value. KCDUTY is obtained by multiplying the proportional gain GCDUTY by the feedback deviation correction coefficient T_GAIN_P which changes according to the charge/discharge current. The feedback deviation correction coefficient is set every running mode.<br>
Thus, as shown in Fig. 14, the control apparatus 1 variably controls the control voltage in accordance with the normal mode, the charge suppressing mode upon idling, the power generation cutting mode upon running, the regenerating mode, and the charge suppressing mode upon running. In the control, the control voltage is controlled so as to become 14.0V in the normal mode, 12.8 to 13.2 V in the charge suppressing mode upon idling, 12.0 to 12.8 V in the power generation cutting mode upon running, 14.0 to 15.0 V in the regenerating mode, and 12.6 to 13.2 V in the charge suppressing mode upon running, respectively.<br>
The transition from the regenerating mode to the charge suppressing mode upon idling by the control apparatus 1 will now be described. As shown in Fig. 15, when the vehicle which is activating the power generation cutting mode upon running starts the deceleration at time t1, the control apparatus 1 finishes the power generation cutting mode upon running and activates the regenerating mode. After the fuel cut upon deceleration was finished at time t2t when time t3 at which a delay time after the recovery has elapsed comes, the control apparatus 1 finishes the regenerating mode and activates the charge suppressing mode upon running.<br>
After that, when the apparatus enters a feedback inhibition interval at time t4, the control apparatus 1 finishes the charge suppressing mode upon running and activates the charge suppressing mode upon idling. Even if the apparatus enters a current feedback interval at time t5, since there are no changes in the conditions, the activation of the charge suppressing mode upon idling is maintained.<br>
The target charge/discharge voltage and the battery voltage coincide for a time interval until time t3 after the halfway of the activation of the power generation cutting mode upon running (for example, 14.5V). The target charge/discharge voltage drops by one stage (13.2V) at time t3 and further drops (13.0V) at time t4, and this value is maintained. The target charge/discharge voltage is feedback controlled to a certain width (interval from 12.8V to 13.2V) after time t5.<br><br>
The battery voltage drops gently (13.2V or more) at time t3, further drops gently (13.0V or more) at time t4, and is converged to a certain width (interval from 12.8V to 13.2V) after time t5.<br>
As mentioned above, according to the control apparatus 1 of the generator for the vehicle, the target charge/discharge current value is set every running mode by the voltage control means 4 and the generation voltage of the alternator 2 is controlled so as to obtain the target charge/discharge current value. Therefore, the control of the alternator 2 which is not influenced by the electric load amounts or the charge state of the battery 3 can be realized. Thus, the control apparatus 1 of the generator for the vehicle can realize the generation amount suppression control for reducing the fuel consumption amount without setting the battery 3 into the over-discharge state.<br>
When the running mode is the power generation cutting mode upon running, the voltage control means 4 can set the target charge/discharge current value to such a value that the charge/discharge state of the battery 3 is controlled in the discharging direction as compared with that in the normal mode. Thus, as a running conditions, since the control apparatus 1 of the generator for the vehicle has the power generation cutting mode upon running in which the discharge current value of the battery 3 is controlled to a value which is slightly set to the discharge side as compared with that in the normal mode, the load of the alternator 2 can be reduced and the load amount to the engine can be reduced.<br>
If the accumulation discharge amount exceeds the set value upon execution of the power generation cutting mode upon running, the voltage control means 4 stops the execution. Thus, since the control apparatus 1 of the generator for the vehicle does not execute the power generation cutting mode upon running in the state where an influence is exerted on the life of the battery 3, the reliability of the charge/discharge system is not deteriorated.<br>
Further, when the running mode is the charge suppressing mode upon idling and the charge suppressing mode upon running, the voltage control means 4 sets the target charge/discharge current value to such a value that the charge/discharge state of the battery 3 is controlled in the discharging direction as compared with that in the normal mode and that the charge/discharge state of the battery is controlled in the charging<br><br>
direction as compared with that in the power generation cutting mode upon running. Thus, just after the power generation cutting mode upon running was executed or even in the charge suppressing mode upon idling, the control apparatus 1 of the generator for the vehicle makes such control that the battery 3 is not actively set into the charge state. Therefore, an amount of load which is applied to the engine can be reduced and the fuel consumption amount can be decreased.<br>
Furthermore, the voltage control means 4 is set so that it can preferentially execute the mode in order of the power generation cutting mode upon running, the charge suppressing mode upon idling, the charge suppressing mode upon running, the regenerating mode, and the normal mode. Thus, since the control apparatus 1 of the generator for the vehicle preferentially executes such control that the reduction amount of the fuel consumption amount is large, as a whole power generating system, the effective fuel consumption amount reducing function can be provided.<br>
In the above embodiments, although the control by the charge/discharge current is not made in the normal mode, the feedback control by the current value can be also made by using the normal mode as a part of the control. In the case of making the feedback control by the current value by using the normal mode as a part of the control, the target charge/discharge current is set as shown in Fig. 16. In this case, such control can be accomplished by making the target charge/discharge current function as a current limitation in a manner similar to the example of the current control in the regenerating mode.<br>
The normal mode differs from the regenerating mode with respect to the following points: (1) a gradual exciting speed is set to a slightly low speed, (2) the target voltage is set to the same value or to a slightly low voltage, and (3) the limitation current is set to a slightly small value.<br>
Thus, the control apparatus 1 realizes the control of the alternator 2 which is not influenced by the electric load amount or the charge state of the battery 3 while including the normal mode and can realize the power generation amount suppressing control for reducing the fuel consumption amount without setting the battery 3 into the over-discharge state.<br><br>
