				<td>This invention relates to a process for the preparation of a low fat snack - like Chakli. Deep fat products are valued for their crisp and crunchy texture and are prepared from cereals and cereal-pulse mixtures. Generally their manufacture involves some form of extrusion of the cereal-pulse dough followed by frying. In many developed countries they are usually prepared by high-pressure extrusion to achieve high degree of expansion. In India they are made by forming extrusion (or sheeting by rollers) optionally with addition of some leavening agents followed by deep-frying in oil leading to a crisp product. Sometimes cereal doughs are cooked, extruded and dried. However these are to be fried for becoming crunchy/crisp products. Sometimes pre cooking and also post cooking of the dough is also required for certain extruded products. These products can be prepared by baking or frying without using complex high-pressure extrusion apparatus. Another class of snack foods made in India is from a non-gelatinized, non-extruded dough baked on a pan, like Khakra and horse gram papads.<br>
A few processes available for the production of snack products in different countries are described.<br>
The reference may be made to US patent US 4770891, 1988, wherein an expanded fried cereal-based snack product was prepared from a dough by mixing of partially gelatinized, pre-gelatinized and ungelatinized cereal flour or starch. The dough was sheeted, cut into pieces and fried in hot oil. The drawback of this process is that it is a high fat snack and can not be stored for long.<br>
The reference may be made to US 4623550, 1983. The process is given below. An expanded fried cereal-based snack product is prepared from a dough consisting essentially of (1) a low water-absorbing component (LOWAC) comprising one or more raw or partially gelatinised cereal flours comprising about 20% to about 80%, by weight, of the total dry solids; (2) a high water-absorbing component (HIWAC) comprising one or more pregelatinized cereal starches or flours comprising from about 10% to about 35% ,. by weight, of the total dry solids: and (3) a starch component comprising one or more ungelatinized starches comprising from about 10% to about 40% by weight, of the total dry solids. The dry solids are mixed with water to form a dough having a moisture content from about 35% to about 50% by weight of the dough. The dough is then sheeted and cut into a dough piece which is fried in hot cooking oil to form a fried snack that expands about 1.4 to about 2.5 times during frying, producing a snack of uniform expansion and low fat content. The drawback of the process is that it is a high fat snack and cannot be stored for long.<br>
The reference may be made to US patent US 4560569, 1985, wherein a dough-based fried snack food was formulated. He improved the dough transfer, sheeting and cutting of the dough by adding a small amount of lecithin-in-water suspension to the formulation of the dough. The drawback of the process is that potato flakes, corn flakes and wheat flakes are the essential ingredients not the grain flour as such. Moreover it is a fried product; so, it is a high fat snack. It is not a ready-to-fry product.<br>
The reference may be made to US patent US4221842, 1980, wherein a fried potato snack was prepared.   Dough with acetylated mono glyceride as a binder was extrusion-cooked at a fairly<br>
high-temperature to get a ribbon shaped product, which .then cooked and dried for one day and fried. The drawback of this process is that it is a complicated process and use of costly equipment such as extruder cooker.<br>
The reference may be made to US patent US 4151307, 1979, wherein a fried starch containing snack product was produced from a dough of cereal flour-and / or starch and tempeh, which was then shaped and the shaped pieces were deep fat fried. The drawback of this process lies in high fat content of the fried snack.<br>
The reference may be made to US patent US 4126706, 1978, wherein a dough comprising of corn or potato solids was extrusion cooked and formed dough ribbon. The ribbon was then fried in hot oil to make corn chips like product. The drawbacks of the process lie in the steps of high temperature and pressure extrusion cooking which makes the process high cost investment and moreover, it is a high fat snack.<br>
The reference may be made to US patent US 4124727. 1978 wherein a nutritionally balanced protein snack food was prepared from legume seeds selected from the group consisting of the genus Phaseolus, the genus Pisum, the genus Vigna, the genus Lens, the genus Cicer, and the genus Soja and cereal flours. After cooking the legume seeds, mashed and mixed with cereal flours and extrude the dough to form sheet, cut it into pieces and frying in edible oil. The drawback of the process lies in the step of long time soaking of the legume seeds. Another limitation is that it is a high fat snack product.<br>
The reference may be made to US patent US 4096791, 1978. wherein an apparatus for preparing a chip type snack is disclosed. The apparatus for making chip type snack products was comprising (a) mixing means (b) sheeting means (c) cutting means (d) frying means (e) transporting means (f) molding means (g) severing means and (h) conveying means. The drawback of this process is that it is just to provide the apparatus for making chips not the formulation or way of making the chips.<br>
The reference may be made to Narasimha, H.V., Ananthachar, T.K., Gopal, M.S. and Desikachar, H.S.R. 1974 (Suitability of raw and steamed cereal grains for making deep fried<br>
4<br>
preparations. J.Food Sci and Technol, 11:76-78.) wherein they have studied for suitability of different cereal grains for making crisp deep fried products and the effect of steam treatment on the same. The observation has been made use of for developing mixes for Chakli and Muchorai to prepare deep fat fried snack but not for low fat products.<br>
The reference may be made to US patent US 3911142, 1975, wherein a process for preparing a protein snack food was described. A ready-to-eat snack food from soy protein, whey and potato flakes mixing with wheat flour was made to form a mass, shaping the mass into pieces and baking or frying to produce the desired product. It is essentially a wheat product of cookie type and the sequences of processing steps differ from the one presented.<br>
The reference may be made to US patent IJS 393,7848, 1,976 wherein a method and apparatus for preparing a chip type snack is disclosed. A dough from dehydrated potato material and water was sheeted and cutting into a ribbon, which then fried in oil, and fracturing the ribbon across the<br>
narrow portions to provide fabricated fried potato chips. It is a deep fat fried potato product. So it is a high fat snack and very different from the one presented here.<br>
The reference may be made to US patent US 3925563, 1975, wherein an extruded puffed snack product was prepared from potato granules and corn grits by extrusion cooking and expanding, which then cutting into pieces, toasting and enrobing the pieces with an edible oil and salt. The drawback of the process is that it needs costly equipment or machinery, like expanded extruder, oil enrober.<br>
The reference may be made to US patent US 3883671, 1975 wherein a blister free potato snack has been prepared by wetting the surfaces of dough pieces prior to frying. The drawback of the process lie in the critical processing steps like dipping, spraying, and steaming. Moreover it is a high fat snack.<br>
The reference may be made to US patent US 3864505, 1975 wherein a crisp snack food was prepared from a dough of potato mixed with other cereal, sheeting the dough and frying in oil and shaping the dough pieces before they fried dough becomes rigid.
