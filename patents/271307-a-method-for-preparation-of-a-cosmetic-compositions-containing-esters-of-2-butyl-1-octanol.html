				<td>Cosmetic compositions containing esters of 2-butyl-1-octanol<br><br>
Field of the invention<br><br>
The invention relates to the use of esters of 2-butyl-1-octanol in cosmetic and/or pharmaceutical preparations, and to specific esters and processes for their preparation.<br><br>
Prior art<br><br>
In the area of cosmetic emulsions for skincare and hair care, a large number of requirements are imposed by the consumer: apart from the cleaning and care effects, which determine the intended use, value is placed on such differing parameters as highest possible dermatological compatibility, good refatting properties, elegant appearance, optimum sensory impression and storage stability.<br><br>
Besides a series of surface-active substances, preparations which are used for the cleaning and care of the human skin and the hair generally comprise in particular oil bodies and water. The oil bodies/emollients used are, for example, hydrocarbons, ester oils, and vegetable and animal oils/fats/waxes. In order to meet the high market requirements with regard to sensory properties and optimum dermatological compatibility, new oil bodies and emulsifier mixtures are continuously being developed and tested. The use of ester oils in cosmetics has been known for a long time. On account of their importance, new processes for their preparation are also continuously being developed. In particular branched ester oils impart a “lighter” skin feel and are therefore being intensively investigated. The use of 2-methyl-1,3-propanediol monoesters is, for example, the subject of DE 101 60 681, the use of 2-methyl-1,3-propanediol diesters is described in DE 101 60 682.<br><br>
It was an object of the present invention to provide novel ester oils that are preferably liquid at 20°C for cosmetic applications which have an improved profile with regard to the sensory properties (lightness, “nongreasy skin feel”, softness, spreadability, absorption, distributability, oiliness) and can be incorporated into a large number of cosmetic formulations. In this connection, the hydrolysis stability of the esters and also the ability of the esters to be formulated at a low pH were also of interest. Furthermore, it should be possible to incorporate the esters both into W/O and also into O/W formulations. Furthermore, the esters should be compatible in particular with crystalline UV filters, pigments, antiperspirants salts and silicones. Surprisingly, it has been found that esters of 2-butyl-1-octanol lead to sensorily light products. Some of these esters are described by Knothe G., JAOCS, Vol 78, No 5, 2001, pp 537-540. The esters described therein are described as possible additives for biodiesel.<br><br>
Description of the invention<br><br>
The invention provides the use of esters of 2-butyl-1-octanol with C2-C36-carboxylic acids - or C2-C36-dicarboxylic acids with the exception of 2-butyloctyl 2-butyloctanoate, 2-butyloctyl 2-butyldecanoate, 2-butyloctyl 2-hexyldecanoate, 2-butyloctyl 2-octyldodecanoate in cosmetic and/or pharmaceutical preparations.<br><br>
Surprisingly, esters of 2-butyl-1-octanol are particularly well suited for cosmetic formulations, in particular for formulations for which a “light” skin feel is important. The esters can be very readily incorporated into various formulations. Depending on the chain length, branching and number of double bonds, liquid substance mixtures are obtained which are accordingly suitable as oil bodies or consistency regulators. According to the invention, it is possible to use a single 2-butyl-1-octyl C2-C36-carboxylic acid ester or 2-butyl-1-octyl C2-C36-dicarboxylic acid ester or any mixture thereof.<br><br>
The invention further provides the use of esters of 2-butyl-1-octanol with linear C2-C36-carboxylic acids - or C2-C36-dicarboxylic acids in cosmetic and/or pharmaceutical preparations.<br><br>
The invention further provides the use of esters of 2-butyl-1-octanol with C2-C36-carboxylic acids - or C2-C36-dicarboxylic acids as oil bodies in cosmetic and/or pharmaceutical preparations.<br><br>
The invention further provides the use of esters of 2-butyl-1-octanol with C2-C36-carboxylic acids - or C2-C36-dicarboxylic acids with the exception of 2-butyloctyl 2-butyloctanoate, 2-butyloctyl 2-butyldecanoate, 2-butyloctyl 2-hexyldecanoate, 2-butyloctyl 2-octyldodecanoate as oil bodies in cosmetic and/or pharmaceutical preparations.<br><br>
The invention provides in particular the use of esters of 2-butyl-1-octanol with C2-C36-carboxylic acids - or C2-C36-dicarboxylic acids in cosmetic and/or pharmaceutical preparations for the wetting or impregnation or coating of utility wipes and/or hygiene wipes which are used for body cleaning and/or for body care.<br><br>
The terms “2-butyl-1-octanol” and “2-butyloctanol” are used synonymously in the present description, as are the prefixes “2-butyl-1-octyl” and “2-butyloctyl”.<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, esters are used whose total carbon number is less than or equal to 24, preferably less than or equal to 22.<br><br>

Nonionic emulsifiers<br><br>
The group of nonionic emulsifiers includes, for example:<br><br>
(1)	Addition products of from 2 to 50 mol of ethylene oxide and/or 1 to 20 mol of propylene oxide onto linear fatty alcohols having 8 to 40 carbon atoms, onto fatty acids having 12 to 40 carbon atoms and onto alkylphenols having 8 to 15 carbon atoms in the alkyl group.<br>
(2)	C12-C18-fatty acid mono- and diesters of addition products of from 1 to 50 mol of ethylene oxide onto glycerol.<br>
(3)	Sorbitan mono- and diesters of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids having 6 to 22 carbon atoms and ethylene oxide addition products thereof.<br>
(4)	Alkyl mono- and oligoglycosides having 8 to 22 carbon atoms in the alkyl radical and their ethoxylated analogs.<br>
(5)	Addition products of from 7 to 60 mol of ethylene oxide onto castor oil and/or hydrogenated castor oil.<br>
(6)	Polyol and in particular polyglycerol esters, such as, for example, polyol poly-12-hydroxystearates, polyglycerol polyricinoleate, polyglycerol diisostearate or polyglycerol dimerate. Likewise suitable are mixtures of compounds from two or more of these substance classes.<br>
(7)	Addition products of from 2 to 15 mol of ethylene oxide onto castor oil and/or hydrogenated castor oil.<br>
(8)	Partial esters based on linear, branched, unsaturated or saturated C6-C22-fatty acids, ricinoleic acid, and 12-hydroxystearic acid and polyglycerol, pentaerythritol, dipentaerythritol, sugar alcohols (e.g. sorbitol), alkyl glucosides (e.g. methyl glucoside, butyl glucoside, lauryl glucoside), and also polyglucosides (e.g. cellulose), or mixed esters, such as, for example, glyceryl stearate citrate and glyceryl stearate lactate.<br>
(9)	Polysiloxane-polyalkyl-polyether copolymers and corresponding derivatives.<br>
(10)	Mixed esters of pentaerythritol, fatty acids, citric acid and fatty alcohol and/or mixed esters of fatty acids having 6 to 22 carbon atoms, methylglucose and polyols, preferably glycerol or polyglycerol.<br><br>
The addition products of ethylene oxide and/or of propylene oxide onto fatty alcohols, fatty acids, alkylphenols, glycerol mono- and diesters, and also sorbitan mono- and diesters of fatty acids or onto castor oil are known, commercially available products. These are homolog mixtures whose average degree of alkoxylation corresponds to the ratio of the quantitative amounts of ethylene oxide and/or propylene oxide and substrate with which the addition reaction is carried out. Depending on the degree of ethoxylation, they are W/O or O/W emulsifiers. C12/18-Fatty acid mono- and diesters of addition products of ethylene oxide onto glycerol are known as refatting agents for cosmetic preparations.<br><br>
Particularly highly suitable and mild emulsifiers according to the invention are polyol poly-12-hydroxystearates and mixtures thereof, which are sold, for example, under the names “Dehymuls? PGPH” (W/O emulsifier) or “Eumulgin? VL 75” (mixture with coco glucosides in the weight ratio 1:1, O/W emulsifier) or Dehymuls? SBL (W/O emulsifier) from Cognis Deutschland GmbH. In this connection, reference may be made in particular to the European Patent EP 0 766 661 B1. The polyol component of these emulsifiers can be derived from substances which have at least two, preferably 3 to 12 and in particular 3 to 8, hydroxyl groups and 2 to 12 carbon atoms.<br><br>
Suitable lipophilic W/O emulsifiers are in principle emulsifiers with an HLB value of from 1 to 8, which are summarized in numerous tables and are known to the person skilled in the art. Some of these emulsifiers are listed, for example, in Kirk-Othmer, “Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology”, 3rd edition, 1979, volume 8, page 913. For ethoxylated products, the HLB value can also be calculated according to the following formula: HLB = (100 – L):5, where L is the weight fraction of the lipophilic groups, i.e. of the fatty alkyl or fatty acyl groups in percent by weight, in the ethylene oxide adducts.<br><br>
From the group of W/O emulsifiers, partial esters of polyols, in particular of C4-C6-polyols, such as, for example, partial esters of pentaerythritol or sugar esters, e.g. saccharose distearate, sorbitan monoisostearate, sorbitan sesquiisostearate, sorbitan diisostearate, sorbitan triisostearate, sorbitan monooleate, sorbitan sesquioleate, sorbitan dioleate, sorbitan trioleate, sorbitan monoerucate, sorbitan sesquierucate, sorbitan dierucate, sorbitan trierucate, sorbitan monoricinoleate, sorbitan sesquiricinoleate, sorbitan diricinoleate, sorbitan triricinoleate, sorbitan monohydroxystearate, sorbitan sesquihydroxystearate, sorbitan dihydroxystearate, sorbitan trihydroxystearate, sorbitan monotartrate, sorbitan sesquitartrate, sorbitan ditartrate, sorbitan tritartrate, sorbitan monocitrate, sorbitan sesquicitrate, sorbitan dicitrate, sorbitan tricitrate, sorbitan monomaleate, sorbitan sesquimaleate, sorbitan dimaleate, sorbitan trimaleate, and technical-grade mixtures thereof are particularly advantageous. Suitable emulsifiers are also addition products of from 1 to 30, preferably 5 to 10 mol of ethylene oxide onto the specified sorbitan esters.<br><br>
Depending on the formulation, it may be advantageous to additionally use at least one emulsifier from the group of nonionic O/W emulsifiers (HLB value: 8 – 18) and/or solubilizers. These are, for example, the ethylene oxide adducts already mentioned in the introduction which have a correspondingly high degree of ethoxylation, e.g. 10 – 20 ethylene oxide units for O/W emulsifiers and 20 – 40 ethylene oxide units for so-called solubilizers. According to the invention, particularly advantageous O/W emulsifiers are Ceteareth-12 and PEG-20 stearate. Suitable solubilizers are preferably Eumulgin? HRE 40 (INCI: PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil), Eumulgin? HRE 60 (INCI: PEG 60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil), Eumulgin? L (INCI: PPG 1 PEG 9 Laurylglycolether), and also Eumulgin? SML 20 (INCI: Polysorbate-20).<br><br>
Nonionic emulsifiers from the group of alkyl oligoglycosides are particularly skin-friendly and therefore preferably suitable as O/W emulsifiers. C8-C22-Alkyl mono- and oligoglycosides, their preparation and their use are known from the prior art. Their preparation takes place in particular by reacting glucose or oligosaccharides with primary alcohols having 8 to 22 carbon atoms. With regard to the glycoside radical, both monoglycosides, in which one cyclic sugar radical is glycosidically bonded to the fatty alcohol, and also oligomeric glycosides with a degree of oligomerization up to preferably about 8 are suitable. The degree of oligomerization here is a statistical average value which is based on a homolog distribution customary for such technical products. Products which are available under the name Plantacare? comprise a glucosidically bonded C8-C16-alkyl group on an oligoglucoside radical whose average degree of oligomerization is 1 to 2. The acyl glucamides derived from glucamine are also suitable as nonionic emulsifiers. According to the invention, preference is given to a product which is sold under the name Emulgade? PL 68/50 by Cognis Deutschland GmbH and is a 1:1 mixture of alkyl polyglucosides and fatty alcohols. According to the invention, a mixture of lauryl glucoside, polyglycerol-2 dipolyhydroxystearate, glycerol and water, which is commercially available under the name Eumulgin? VL 75, can also be used advantageously.<br><br>
Suitable emulsifiers are also substances such as lecithins and phospholipids. Examples of natural lecithins which may be mentioned are the cephalins, which are also referred to as phosphatidic acids and are derivatives of 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphoric acids. By contrast, phospholipids are usually understood as meaning mono- and preferably diesters of phosphoric acid with glycerol (glycerol phosphates), which are generally classed as fats. In addition, sphingosines and/or sphingolipids are also suitable.<br><br>
Surfactants b-2)<br><br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the preparations according to the invention comprise at least one surfactant. Surface-active substances which may be present are anionic, nonionic, cationic and/or amphoteric or zwitterionic surfactants. In surfactant-containing cosmetic preparations, such as, for example, shower gels, foam baths, shampoos etc., at least one anionic surfactant is preferably present.<br><br>
The compositions according to the invention comprise the surfactant(s) in an amount of from 0 to 40% by weight, preferably 0 to 20% by weight, preferably 0.1 to 15% by weight and in particular 0.1 to 10% by weight, based on the total weight of the composition.<br><br>
Typical examples of nonionic surfactants are fatty alcohol polyglycol ethers, alkylphenol polyglycol ethers, fatty acid polyglycol esters, fatty acid amide polyglycol ethers, fatty amine polyglycol ethers, alkoxylated triglycerides, mixed ethers and mixed formals, optionally partially oxidized alk(en)yl oligoglycosides and glucoronic acid derivatives, fatty acid N-alkylglucamides, protein hydrolyzates (in particular wheat-based vegetable products), polyol fatty acid esters, sugar esters, sorbitan esters, polysorbates and amine oxides. If the nonionic surfactants comprise polyglycol ether chains, these can have a conventional homolog distribution, but preferably have a narrowed homolog distribution.<br><br>
Zwitterionic surfactants is the term used to refer to those surface-active compounds which carry at least one quaternary ammonium group and at least one –COO(-) or  SO3(-) group in the molecule. Particularly suitable zwitterionic surfactants are the so-called betaines, such as the N-alkyl-N,N-dimethylammonium glycinates, for example cocoalkyldimethylammonium glycinate, N-acylaminopropyl-N,N-dimethylammonium glycinates, for example cocoacylaminopropyldimethylammonium glycinate, and 2-alkyl-3-carboxylmethyl-3-hydroxyethylimidazoline having in each case 8 to 18 carbon atoms in the alkyl or acyl group, and cocoacylaminoethylhydroxyethylcarboxymethyl glycinate. A preferred zwitterionic surfactant is the fatty acid amide derivative known under the INCI name Cocamidopropyl Betaine.<br><br>
Likewise suitable, particularly as cosurfactants, are ampholytic surfactants. Ampholytic surfactants are understood as meaning those surface-active compounds which, apart from a C8-C18-alkyl or acyl group in the molecule, contain at least one free amino group and at least one –COOH or –SO3H group and are capable of forming internal salts. Examples of suitable ampholytic surfactants are N-alkylglycines, N-alkylpropionic acids, N-alkylaminobutyric acids, N-alkyliminodipropionic acids, N-hydroxyethyl-N-alkylamidopropylglycines, N-alkyltaurines, N-alkylsarcosines, 2-alkylaminopropionic acids and alkylaminoacetic acids having in each case about 8 to 18 carbon atoms in the alkyl group. Particularly preferred ampholytic surfactants are N-cocoalkylaminopropionate, cocoacylaminoethylaminopropionate and C12-18-acylsarcosine.<br><br>
Anionic surfactants are characterized by a water-solubilizing, anionic group such as, for example, a carboxylate, sulfate, sulfonate or phosphate group and a lipophilic radical. Skin-compatible anionic surfactants are known to the person skilled in the art in a large number from relevant handbooks and are commercially available. These are in particular alkyl sulfates in the form of their alkali metal, ammonium or alkanolammonium salts, alkyl ether sulfates, alkyl ether carboxylates, acyl isethionates, acyl sarcosinates, acyltaurines with linear alkyl or acyl groups having 12 to 18 carbon atoms, and sulfosuccinates and acyl glutamates in the form of their alkali metal or ammonium salts.<br><br>
Cationic surfactants which can be used are in particular quaternary ammonium compounds. Preference is given to ammonium halides, in particular chlorides and bromides, such as alkyltrimethylammonium chlorides, dialkyldimethylammonium chlorides and trialkylmethylammonium chlorides, e.g. cetyltrimethylammonium chloride, stearyltrimethylammonium chloride, distearyldimethylammonium chloride, lauryldimethylammonium chloride, lauryldimethylbenzylammonium chloride and tricetylmethylammonium chloride. Furthermore, the very readily biodegradable quaternary ester compounds, such as, for example, the dialkylammonium methosulfates and methylhydroxyalkyldialkoyloxyalkylammonium methosulfates sold under the trade name Stepantex? and the corresponding products of the Dehyquart? series, can be used as cationic surfactants. The term “ester quats” is generally understood as meaning quaternized fatty acid triethanolamine ester salts. They can impart a particular soft feel to the compositions according to the invention. These are known substances which are prepared by the relevant methods of organic chemistry. Further cationic surfactants that can be used according to the invention are the quaternized protein hydrolyzates.<br><br>
Wax component b-3)<br><br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the preparations according to the invention comprise at least one wax component. The compositions according to the invention comprise the wax component(s) in an amount of from 0 to 40% by weight, in particular from 0 to 20% by weight, preferably 0.1 to 15% by weight and in particular 0.1 to 10% by weight, based on the total weight of the composition.<br><br>
The term wax is generally understood as meaning all natural or synthetically obtained substances and substance mixtures with the following properties: they are of solid to brittly hard consistency, coarse to finely crystalline, transparent to opaque and melt above 30°C without decomposition. Even a little above the melting point, they are of low viscosity and not thread-drawing and exhibit a highly temperature-dependent consistency and solubility. According to the invention, it is possible to use a wax component or a mixture of wax components which melt at 30°C or above.<br><br>
According to the invention, waxes which can be used are also fats and fat-like substances with wax-like consistency provided they have the required melting point. These include, inter alia, fats (triglycerides), mono- and diglycerides, natural and synthetic waxes, fatty alcohols and wax alcohols, fatty acids, esters of fatty alcohols and fatty acids, and fatty acid amides or any desired mixtures of these substances.<br><br>
Fats are understood as meaning triacylglycerols, i.e. the triple esters of fatty acids with glycerol. Preferably, they comprise saturated, unbranched and unsubstituted fatty acid radicals. These may be mixed esters, i.e. triple esters of glycerol with various fatty acids. So-called hydrogenated fats and oils obtained by partial hydrogenation can be used according to the invention and are particularly suitable as consistency regulators. Vegetable hydrogenated fats and oils are preferred, e.g. hydrogenated castor oil, peanut oil, soybean oil, colza oil, rapeseed oil, cottonseed oil, soybean oil, sunflower oil, palm oil, palm kernel oil, linseed oil, almond oil, corn oil, olive oil, sesame oil, cocoa butter and coconut fat.<br><br>
Inter alia, the triple esters of glycerol with C12 C60-fatty acids and in particular C12-C36-fatty acids are suitable. These include hydrogenated castor oil, a triple ester of glycerol and a hydroxystearic acid, which is commercially available, for example, under the name Cutina HR. Glycerol tristearate, glycerol tribehenate (e.g. Syncrowax HRC), glycerol tripalmitate or the triglyceride mixtures known under the name Syncrowax HGLC are likewise suitable, with the proviso that the melting point of the wax component or of the mixture is 30°C or above.<br><br>
According to the invention, wax components which can be used are in particular mono- and diglycerides and mixtures of these partial glycerides. Glyceride mixtures that can be used according to the invention include the products Novata AB and Novata B (mixture of C12 C18-mono-, di- and triglycerides) and Cutina MD or Cutina GMS (glycerol stearate) marketed by Cognis Deutschland GmbH &amp; Co. KG.<br><br>
Fatty alcohols which can be used according to the invention as wax component include the C12-C50-fatty alcohols. The fatty alcohols can be obtained from natural fats, oils and waxes, such as, for example, myristyl alcohol, 1-pentadecanol, cetyl alcohol, 1-heptadecanol, stearyl alcohol, 1-nonadecanol, arachidyl alcohol, 1-heneicosanol, behenyl alcohol, brassidyl alcohol, lignoceryl alcohol, ceryl alcohol or myricyl alcohol. According to the invention, saturated, unbranched fatty alcohols are preferred. However, unsaturated, branched or unbranched fatty alcohols can also be used according to the invention as wax component provided they have the required melting point. According to the invention, it is also possible to use fatty alcohol cuts as are produced during the reduction of naturally occurring fats and oils, such as, for example, bovine tallow, peanut oil, colza oil, cottonseed oil, soybean oil, sunflower oil, palm kernel oil, linseed oil, castor oil, corn oil, rapeseed oil, sesame oil, cocoa butter and coconut fat. However, it is also possible to use synthetic alcohols, e.g. the linear, even-numbered fatty alcohols of the Ziegler synthesis (alfols) or the partially branched alcohols from the oxo synthesis (dobanols). According to the invention, C14-C22-fatty alcohols, which are marketed, for example, by Cognis Deutschland GmbH under the name Lanette 16 (C16-alcohol), Lanette 14 (C14-alcohol), Lanette O (C16/C18-alcohol) and Lanette 22 (C18/C22-alcohol) are particularly preferably suitable. Fatty alcohols give the compositions a drier skin feel than triglycerides and are therefore preferred over the latter.<br><br>
Wax components which can be used are also C14-C40 fatty acids or mixtures thereof. These include, for example, myristic acid, pentadecanoic acid, palmitic acid, margaric acid, stearic acid, nonadecanoic acid, arachic acid, behenic acid, lignoceric acid, cerotic acid, mellissic acid, erucic acid and elaeostearic acid, and substituted fatty acids, such as, for example, 12-hydroxystearic acid, and the amides or monoethanolamides of the fatty acids, this list being exemplary and nonlimiting in character.<br><br>
According to the invention, it is possible to use, for example, natural vegetable waxes, such as candelilla wax, carnauba wax, japan wax, esparto grass wax, cork wax, guaruma wax, rice germ oil wax, sugar cane wax, ouricury wax, montan wax, sunflower wax, fruit waxes such as orange waxes, lemon waxes, grapefruit wax, bayberry wax, and animal waxes, such as, for example, beeswax, shellac wax, spermaceti, wool wax and uropygial fat. Within the context of the invention, it may be advantageous to use hydrogenated or hardened waxes. Natural waxes that can be used according to the invention also include the mineral waxes, such as, for example, ceresin and ozokerite or the petrochemical waxes, such as, for example, petrolatum, paraffin waxes and microwaxes. Wax components which can be used are also chemically modified waxes, in particular the hard waxes, such as, for example, montan ester waxes, sasol waxes and hydrogenated jojoba waxes. Synthetic waxes which can be used according to the invention include, for example, wax-like polyalkylene waxes and polyethylene glycol waxes. Vegetable waxes are preferred according to the invention.<br><br>
The wax component can likewise be selected from the group of wax esters of saturated and/or unsaturated, branched and/or unbranched alkane carboxylic acids and saturated and/or unsaturated, branched and/or unbranched alcohols, from the group of esters of aromatic carboxylic acids, dicarboxylic acids, tricarboxylic acids and hydroxycarboxylic acids (e.g. 12-hydroxystearic acid) and saturated and/or unsaturated, branched and/or unbranched alcohols, and also from the group of lactides of long-chain hydroxycarboxylic acids. Examples of such esters are the C16-C40-alkyl stearates, C20-C40-alkyl stearates (e.g. Kesterwachs K82H), C20-C40-dialkyl esters of dimer acids, C18-C38-alkylhydroxystearoyl stearates or C20-C40-alkyl erucates.
