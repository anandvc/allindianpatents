				<td>METHOD FOR PRODUCTION OF SINGLE- AND MULTI-LAYER<br>
MICROCAPSULES<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to methods of microencapsulation of active ingredients such as agents having biological activity, odor agents and color agents for topical applications. The microcapsules obtained according to the provided methods are single-layer or multi-layer, preferably double-layer, microcapsules, that maintain the original activity of the encapsulated agents and enable controlled release of the active ingredient only when applied topically.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The art of microencapsulation has been the object of considerable attention in recent years in view of the increased necessity to maintain a reactive substance in an inert stage until the time it is required to perform a given function. Microencapsulation provides a number of benefits, the most outstanding being the capability of microcapsules to protect sensitive substances against chemical and physical degradation, to allow separation of substances which are harmful upon contact with each other, to mask an original odor, color or taste of a substance, to control dispersibility of substances, and to prevent undesirable release of an encapsulated substance to the formulation that contains it.<br>
Microcapsules are available usually in powder form and consist of spherical particles, which contain an encapsulated (entrapped) substance. The spherical particle usually consists of a polymeric shell and the encapsulated substance is located within the shell. The polymeric shell is frequently applied as a wall-forming material and serves as a membrane for the encapsulated substance. This membrane may be semi-permeable or degradable, and therefore it allows the microcapsule to be an efficient tool for controlled release applications.<br><br>
Microencapsulation itself has various advantages. Microcapsules protect sensitive substances from degradation processes and provide means for controlled release of desired active substances. It also enables the conversion of liquids to powders and is used to isolate substances that are otherwise detrimental when in contact with each other.<br>
Numerous techniques for microencapsulation are available depending on the nature of the encapsulated substance and on the type of polymer used. A widely used method for encapsulation of water-insoluble substances such as some vitamins, drugs and oils within water-insoluble polymers is the solvent removal method. Generally in such a process the desired polymer is dissolved in a suitable organic solvent. This action is followed by addition of the desired substance to be encapsulated. This substance is either dissolved or dispersed in the organic solvent. The resulting organic solution or dispersion is dispersed in an aqueous phase to obtain an oil-in-water emulsion where oily microparticles are dispersed in the aqueous phase. Upon complete removal of the solvent from the microparticles, the microcapsules are formed.<br>
Several patents describe methods of removing the solvent. US Patent No. 4,384,975 describes the removal of the solvent by vacuum distillation. In GB 1,394,780 the removal of the solvent is done by evaporation. In US 3,891,570, the removal of the polymer solvent is carried out by heating the aqueous dispersion or by reducing its pressure. In US 3,737,337 the removal of the organic solvent is done by extraction with water, however it is limited to certain solvent systems.<br>
Microencapsulation is suitable for a large variety of materials including drugs, vitamins and food supplements, since this process is easily adaptable by varying the solvents and/or the polymers. Some microencapsulation technologies may yield microcapsules having desirable size, spherical shape and smooth surface - properties important for controlled release, for chemical stability of the core material, and homogeneous delivery of stable active substances to the target area.<br>
A basic prerequisite for this process is the use of a solvent that is able to efficiently dissolve the biologically active substance to be encapsulated as well as<br><br>
the wall-forming material. This solvent has to be only partially soluble in water, giving rise to emulgation of an organic phase in a continuous water phase. Chlorinated solvents such as dichloromethane and chloroform as well as glycols or their mixtures with other solvents have been widely used since they facilitate the microencapsulation process.<br>
However, all the microencapsulation technologies based on solvent systems such as chlorinated solvents are not applicable and are quite inappropriate for food, cosmetics, pharmaceutical, dental and oral products, since they do not meet FDA and other regulations due to the presence of residual amounts of chlorinated solvents in the microcapsules. Simple vacuum or heat drying do not result in a sufficiently low chlorinated solvent content so as to meet FDA regulations, thus creating an essential necessity for a method for encapsulating vitamins, food supplements, oils or Pharmaceuticals by the solvent removal technique.<br>
US Patent No. 6,599,627 discloses a solvent exchange method in order to obtain single-wall microcapsules of Pharmaceuticals. The described method is based on an exchange of water and a non-chlorinated organic solvent such as acetic acid, ethyl acetate, methyl acetate, or ethyl formate to form a biodegradable poly(lactic acid-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) shell around an aqueous drug core. All these solvents meet the FDA regulations.<br>
WO 01/35933 of the same Applicant discloses a method for microencapsulation of substances by the solvent removal method using non-chlorinated solvents.<br>
Few patents disclose techniques for obtaining multi-wall microspheres and microcapsules by various coating processes, which do not apply the solvent removal method, or apply spray-drying technique in the case of volatile organic solvents. US Patent No. 3,429,827 describes coating of the inner microcapsules with a second polymer shell by spray-drying or interfacial condensation methods. US Patent No. 4,861,627 describes a single-step method for preparation of multi-wall microspheres from a mixture of any two or three polymers selected from polyanhydrides, polyorthoesters, poly(lactic acid), polystyrene, polyamides,<br><br>
polybutadiene, polyurethanes, and copolymers, which are not soluble in each other but are soluble in a volatile organic solvent. The mixture is suspended in an aqueous solution followed by slow spray-drying of volatile solvent, creating microspheres with an inner core formed by one polymer and an outer layer formed by a second polymer. US Patent Nos. 5,985,354, 6,511,749 and 6,528,035 disclose preparation of multi-wall polymer microspheres by a similar technique, from hydrophilic, water-soluble polymers that are not soluble in each other at a particular concentration and temperature but have a positive spreading coefficient in solution. US Patent No. 5,795,570 describes the formation of a second semi-permeable membrane, which is made of polysaccharide gum such as an alkali metal alginate, comprising core microcapsules. More specifically, US Patent Publication No. 2003/0222378 discloses microencapsulation of a series of paraffin compounds with an interfacial polymerization process to form double-shell microcapsules with relatively low shell permeability. The inner shell is formed by a reaction between poly(propylene glycol) and bifunctional polyisocyanates, and the outer shell by a reaction between bifunctional polyisocyanates and polyamines that are added to the continuous aqueous phase.<br>
In summary, none of the methods known in the art meets the growing market requirements for a considerable protection factor of the encapsulated substance against oxidation and/or degradation and for the ability to control the release of the encapsulated substance. Hence, there is still a need for an advanced method for stable encapsulation of active substances that simultaneously affords control of its release from the microcapsules.<br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES<br>
Figs. 1A-1B illustrate the effectiveness of protection of Retinol from oxidation when encapsulated in single-layer or double-layer microcapsules of the invention in comparison to non-encapsulated Retinol. Measurements of oxidation kinetics were tested at 25°C (Fig. 1A) and at 40°C (Fig. IB).<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The term "microcapsule", as used herein, refers to a spherical microparticle consisting of a polymeric shell serving as a wall-forming material and an encapsulated active substance located within the shell. This term is distinct from microspheres, which consist of spherical homogeneous granules of the active substance dispersed in a polymer and are, in strict sense, spherically empty particles.<br>
The term "single-layer microcapsule" refers to a microcapsule consisting of a single polymeric shell and the encapsulated active substance located within the shell in the center of the microcapsule.<br>
The term "inner core microcapsule" refers to a single-layer microcapsule as defined above when within a double-layer or multi-layer microcapsule.<br>
The term "multi-layer microcapsule" refers to a microcapsule consisting of an inner core microcapsule and one or more outer polymeric shells. The term "double-layer microcapsule" refers to a microcapsule consisting of the inner core microcapsule coated with a second polymeric shell. In the course of the microencapsulation, the core microcapsules are introduced to the polymer-<br><br>
plasticizer solution or polymer-mineral dispersion, and promote the formation of "embryo" shells, which are converted to a structured solid shell of double-layer microcapsules.<br>
The term "wall-forming polymer" typically refers to a polymer or a combination of two or more different polymers as defined herein, which form a component of the external wall or layer or shell of the microcapsules.<br>
The term "polymer shell" refers to a polymer layer containing the wall-forming polymer and, optionally, further components such as a plasticizer and/or a mineral. The term "polymer-plasticizer shell" refers to a polymer shell containing a plasticizer. The term "polymer-mineral shell" refers to a polymer shell containing a mineral.<br>
The term "composite double-layer or multi-layer microcapsule" refers to a microcapsule in which the inner or outer shell is a polymer-mineral shell.<br>
The term "powdered modified core microcapsule" refers to the inner core microcapsule or the double-layer or multi-layer microcapsule treated with a material able to modify the morphology of the surface of microcapsule and to increase the specific surface area (SSA) of the outer microcapsule's shell up to a level that enables building of a next polymer-plasticizer or polymer-mineral shell on said modified outer shell due to increased adhesion between the two shells.<br>
The term "partially miscible in water", when referring to an organic solvent, should be understood as relating to the property of being able to be dissolved in water in concentrations lower than a certain critical concentration, while the concentration thereof increases above a certain critical value there is phase separation and the water and the organic solvent form two separate phases. An example of such an organic solvent is ethyl acetate or ethyl formate.<br>
The term "saturated" should be understood as referring to a solution that contains the organic solvent in a concentration about the critical value or slightly below, namely, a saturated solution contains a concentration of the organic solvent close to the maximal concentration before phase separation occurs. However, the term "saturated" should not be understood in a limiting fashion in that, at times, also<br><br>
a solution containing less than 90%, and at times even about 80% of the critical concentration may be considered as saturated for the purpose of the invention. The emulsifier used in stage (b) may either be a priori dissolved in the aqueous solution or may be added to the aqueous solution simultaneously or after mixing of the organic solution therewith.<br>
The term "agitation" should be understood as referring to steering, shaking, vibrating and in general to any process whereby mechanical energy is transferred to the liquid to cause some turbulence in the liquid.<br>
The terms "active ingredient" or "active substance" are used herein interchangeably and refer to the material located within the inner core microcapsule, which material may include one or more agents having biological activity, an odor agent or a color agent, and may include non-active ingredients such as an anti-oxidant, a plasticizer, a carrier, etc.<br>
The term "topical application" as used herein refers to external application to the skin, mucous membranes, teeth, hair, scalp. The term "compositions for topical application" includes compositions in any form such as ointment, paste, cream or lotion intended for skin care, skin supplement, sun care, baby care, hair care, oral hygiene (e.g., toothpaste, moutwash), pharmaceutical compositions for topical application, and similar compositions.<br>
The microencapsulation methods of the present invention are based on the solvent removal method.<br>
In one aspect, the present invention relates to a method for the production of microcapsules for topical application, wherein the microcapsules consist of a core made of an encapsulated active ingredient and one or more shells of the same or different wall-forming polymer(s), said method comprising the steps of:<br>
(a) dissolving or dispersing the active ingredient, optionally together with an antioxidant, a plasticizer or both, in an organic solvent of a kind that is partially miscible with water and is capable of dissolving or dispersing said substance, together with a wall-forming polymer selected from the group consisting of a polyacrylate, a polymethacrylate, low molecular weight poly(methyl methacrylate)-<br><br>
co-(methacrylic acid) (1:0.16), poly(ethyl acrylate)-co( methyl methacrylate)-co-(trimethylammmonium-ethyl methacrylate chloride) (1:2:0.1), poly(butyl methacrylate)-co-(2-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate)-co-(methyl methacrylate) (1:2:1), poly(styrene)-co-(maleic anhydride), a copolymer of octylacrylamide, cellulose ethers, cellulose esters and poly(ethylene glycol)-Woc£-poly(propylene glycol)-Woc£-poly(ethylene glycol), to form an organic solution or dispersion;<br>
(b)	preparing an aqueous continuous phase saturated with said organic solvent<br>
and comprising an emulsifier;<br>
(c)	while agitating, pouring the organic solution or dispersion obtained in (a)<br>
into the aqueous continuous phase obtained in (b), to form an emulsion;<br>
(d)	adding an excess amount of water to the emulsion obtained in (c) to<br>
initiate  extraction  of the organic solvent from  the  emulsion,  and  optionally<br>
incubating   for   further   extraction   of   the   solvent   and   formation   of   solid<br>
microcapsules(hereinafter "the core microcapsules");<br>
(e)	either (i) isolating the core microcapsules, washing with water and drying,<br>
or (ii) immersing the core microcapsules into an aqueous solution of alcohol,<br>
separating   the   core   microcapsules   and   drying,   thus   obtaining   single-layer<br>
microcapsules; and<br>
(f)	if desired, treating the surface of the core single-layer microcapsules<br>
obtained in (e) with a material that modifies the morphology of the core surface,<br>
increases the specific surface area and facilitates the adhesion of an additional<br>
polymeric shell,<br>
and repeating steps (a) to (e) to form double-layer microcapsules, or repeating steps (a) to (f) to add two or more additional layers around the core microcapsule, thereby obtaining multi-layer microcapsules.<br>
When the method is stopped in step (e), single-layer microcapsules are obtained, as described in WO 01/35933. These single-layer microcapsules are not part of the present invention. If a plasticizer is added in step (a), the obtained single-layer microcapsules have an outer polymer-plasticizer shell, and these single-layer microcapsules are encompassed by the present invention.<br><br>
The single-layer microcapsules of the invention can effectively protect active ingredients such as vitamins, oils, natural extracts, essential oils, color agents such as pigments and colorants, odor agents such as fragrances, and Pharmaceuticals for topical application such as antibiotics.<br>
In one embodiment, the active ingredient of the single-layer microcapsules is a plant or herbal oil such as Evening Primrose Oil, Borage Oil, Sea Buckthorn Oil (also known as Hippophae Oil) and Tea Tree Oil.<br>
In another embodiment, the active ingredient of the single-layer microcapsules is an antibiotic such as, but not limited to, a macrolide antibiotic selected from Erythromycin, Clarithromycin and Azithromycin.<br>
The invention also provides single-layer microcapsules for oral hygiene having an outer polymer-plasticizer shell obtained by the method of the invention, wherein the wall-forming polymer is ethyl cellulose and the active ingredient is a vitamin such as Retinol Palmitate or Tocopherol or a plant oil such as Hippophae Oil or Tea Tree Oil.<br>
The microcapsules of the invention are effective in the protection of unstable and/or volatile substances and in the masking of colors and malodor. The effectiveness of protection/masking by single-layer microencapsulation depends on the chemical structure, molecular weight and physical properties of the microencapsulated active ingredient. For some active substances used in topical compositions, the known methods of single-layered microencapsulation do not provide an adequate protection from degradation and/or masking effects. For such actives, a double- or multi-layered microencapsulation may be required in order to obtain an effective protection and/or masking of original odor/color of the target substance for encapsulation.<br>
Thus, in another aspect, the present invention relates to a method for the production of multi-layer microcapsules for topical application consisting of an inner core microcapsule comprising an active substance within a wall-forming polymer shell, and one or more outer shells of the same or different wall-forming polymers coating the inner core microcapsule.<br><br>
In general, the method for the preparation of multi-layer microcapsules according to the present invention consists of four main stages:<br>
(i) preparation of the inner core microcapsules by the solvent removal method as described above for the single-layer microcapsules, using one or more appropriate wall-forming polymers;<br>
(ii) treatment of the surface of said core microcapsules with a material that modifies the morphology of the core microcapsule surface and increases its specific surface area, thus obtaining powdered modified inner core microcapsules that facilitate the adhesion of a next polymeric layer;<br>
(iii) preparation of double-layer microcapsules by coating the powdered modified inner core microcapsules obtained in stage (ii) with either a polymer-plasticizer shell, thus obtaining double-layer microcapsules, or a polymer-mineral shell, thus obtaining composite double-layer microcapsules; and<br>
(iv) repeating stages (ii) and (iii) to form additional layers around the core microcapsules according to the desired number of layers.<br>
Thus, in one embodiment, the present invention relates to a method for the production of multi-layer microcapsules for topical application, wherein the microcapsules consist of an inner core microcapsule which contains an active ingredient located within a wall-forming polymer shell and one or more outer shells of the same or different wall-forming polymer coating the inner core microcapsule, said method comprising the steps of:<br>
(a) dissolving or dispersing the active ingredient, optionally together with an antioxidant, a plasticizer or both, in an organic solvent of a kind that is partially miscible with water and is capable of dissolving or dispersing said substance, together with a wall-forming polymer selected from the group consisting of a polyacrylate, a polymethacrylate, low molecular weight poly(methyl methacrylate)-c'o-(methacrylic acid) (1:0.16), poly(ethyl acrylate)-co-(methyl methacrylate)-co-(trimethylammmonium-ethyl methacrylate chloride) (1:2:0.1), poly(butyl methacrylate)-co-(2-dimethylarninoethyl methacrylate)-co-(methyl methacrylate) (1:2:1), poly(styrene)-co(maleic anhydride), copolymer of octylacrylamide,<br><br>
cellulose ethers, cellulose esters and poly(ethylene glycol)-6/oc£-poly(propylene glycol)-Woc£-poly(ethylene glycol), to form an organic solution or dispersion;<br>
(b)	preparing an aqueous continuous phase saturated with said organic solvent<br>
and comprising an emulsifier;<br>
(c)	while agitating, pouring the organic solution or dispersion obtained in (a)<br>
into the aqueous continuous phase obtained in (b), to form an emulsion;<br>
(d)	adding an excess amount of water to the emulsion obtained in (c) to<br>
initiate  extraction  of the  organic  solvent  from  the  emulsion,  and  optionally<br>
incubating for further extraction of the solvent and formation of solid microcapsules<br>
(hereinafter "the inner core microcapsules");<br>
(e)	either (i) isolating the inner core microcapsules, washing with water and<br>
drying, or (ii) immersing the core microcapsules into an aqueous solution of alcohol,<br>
separating the core microcapsules and drying;<br>
(f)	treating the surface of the dried inner core microcapsules obtained in (e)<br>
with a material that modifies the morphology of the surface, increases its specific<br>
surface area and facilitates the adhesion of an additional polymer shell, thus<br>
obtaining microcapsules powdered with  said  material  (hereinafter "powdered<br>
modified inner cores");<br>
(g) dissolving or dispersing a wall-forming polymer with a plasticizer or a mineral in an organic solvent of a kind that is partially miscible with water, to form a polymer-plasticizer solution or polymer-mineral dispersion;<br>
(h) preparing an aqueous continuous phase saturated with said organic solvent and comprising an emulsifier;<br>
(i) while agitating, pouring the polymer-plasticizer solution or polymer-mineral dispersion obtained in step (g) into the aqueous continuous phase obtained in step (h), to form a polymer-plasticizer emulsion or a polymer-mineral suspo-emulsion;<br>
(j) while agitating, immersing the powdered modified inner cores obtained in step (f) into the polymer-plasticizer emulsion or polymer-mineral suspo-emulsion<br><br>
obtained in step (i), forming a multi-component emulsion or a new suspo-emulsion, in which a formation of "embryo" shells around said core microcapsules is initiated;<br>
(k) while stirring, either (i) adding an excess amount of water to the multi-component emulsion or the new suspo-emulsion obtained in step (j), or (ii) pouring the multi-component emulsion or the new suspo-emulsion obtained in step (j) into water, and incubating the system for extraction of the organic solvent from said multi-component emulsion or suspo-emulsion, and conversion of the "embryo" shell into a solid polymer wall and formation of double-layer microcapsules;<br>
(1) separating the obtained double-layer microcapsules from water and drying the wet capsules, thereby isolating double-layer microcapsules as a free flowing powder; and<br>
(m) if desired, repeating steps (0 to (1) to form one or more additional layers around the double-layer microcapsules, thereby obtaining multi-layer microcapsules.<br>
In step (a) of the method of the invention, an organic solvent that is capable of dissolving or dispersing the active ingredient and the wall-forming materials is chosen. The solvent should be inactive with the dissolved material and can be selected from a variety of solvents such as ethyl acetate, ethanol, ethyl formate or other appropriate solvents approved by the FDA, or their mixtures. In a preferred embodiment, the solvent is ethyl acetate or its mixture with ethanol.<br>
The active substance to be encapsulated by the present method, either a solid or a liquid, is then dissolved or dispersed in the organic solvent to form an organic solution or dispersion. If necessary (i.e., the active substance is sensitive to oxidation), an antioxidant such as butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), or a mixture thereof, can be added at this stage for encapsulation with the active substance.<br>
In order to control the physical properties and level of elasticity of the final microcapsules, it is a preferred embodiment to add at this stage also a plasticizer, such as tricaprylin, trilaurin, tripalmitin, triacetin, triethyl citrate, acetyltriethyl citrate, isopropyl myristate, paraffin oil, or a mixture thereof.<br><br>
The wall-forming material, which may consist of one or more of said polymers defined in step (a), is then dissolved and/or dispersed in the organic solution/dispersion. In preferred embodiments, the wall forming polymer is ethyl cellulose, poly(methyl methacrylate)-co-(methacrylic acid) (1:0.16), poly(ethyl acrylate)-co-(methyl methacrylate)-co-(trimethylammonium-ethyl methacrylate chloride) (1:2:0.1), or a mixture thereof.<br>
In step (b), an aqueous continuous phase is saturated by the same or different organic solvent (or mixture of solvents) used at the first stage. An appropriate emulsifier is added to the aqueous phase. Such an emulsifier may be selected from polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), sodium lauryl sulfate, lauryl phosphate, ethoxylated sorbates such as Tween-80, polyglycerol and poly (ethylene glycol), and their esters and ethers, or a mixture thereof. Said added emulsifier should be chosen and adapted to the system in such a way that it does not separate from water after the organic solvent is added in the next stage. It is advisable to adjust specifically the pH of the aqueous phase according to active substance and solvent properties.<br>
In step (c), the organic solution/dispersion obtained in the first step, which contains the active substance and the wall-forming material, is poured into the aqueous continuous phase saturated with the organic solvent used in the first step, forming an emulsion. The pouring is done with agitation and the agitation is continued for a further period of time. The rate of mixing, type of mixer, and its duration affect, among other factors, the size of the formed droplets. The size of the formed droplets constitutes the basis for the final size of the microcapsules. It may be from 1 to 300 microns and may be controlled and tailored according to the intended use of the microcapsules, for example, preferably about 20-40 micron for topical application and 10-20 micron for dental application. Other factors responsible for the size of the formed droplets are the ratio of water to organic phase, temperature, quantity and kind of emulsifier.<br>
In step (d), water is added to the emulsion formed in the previous step, for extracting the organic solvent. Preferably, the quantity of the water added is 10-30 times higher than the whole quantity of the organic solvent in the mixture. The most<br><br>
preferable ratio for optimal removal of the organic solvent is 20:1 (V/V water: solvent). Following the addition of the water, the mixture is incubated and agitated for several minutes up to a point where the main amount of the organic solvent is extracted into the water and equilibrium is reached. Typically, it takes 3 to 10 up to 15 minutes to reach equilibrium. Upon the gradual removal of the organic solvent, a solid polymer shell is formed surrounding the droplets of emulsion, thus enveloping all the ingredients (active substance, antioxidant, plasticizer), which are insoluble in the obtained solvent system (water with trace of organic solvent), inside of the formed solid core microcapsules. The formed microcapsules are then separated by sedimentation, filtration or centrifugation, subsequently washed with water and dried (step e).<br>
The residue of ethyl acetate and similar solvents in raw materials for topical/dental products should meet the relevant regulations (FDA, Colipa, CTFA, etc.). It is necessary to remove the trace amounts of the organic solvent from the obtained microcapsules up to the limited level. In order to remove trace amounts of the solvent, the present invention presents an effective extraction technique. As defined in alternative step (e), the microcapsules obtained after filtration can be immersed in a 5% solution of ethanol in water for 2-12 hours, thereby causing the trace of organic solvent to be extracted from the microcapsules.<br>
In step (f), the dried inner core microcapsules are treated with a material, e.g. silicon dioxide, boron nitride, magnesium silicate, that modifies the surface of the core microcapsules, changes its morphology, increases the specific surface area (SSA) (at least by 1.5 times), thus obtaining powdered modified inner core microcapsules. The modified surface of the inner core microcapsules increases its adhesion properties, which are suitable for the next layer formation at this step.<br>
In step (g), a wall-forming polymer-plasticizer material for the next polymeric layer (herein designated "polymer-plasticizer shell") is prepared by dissolving or dispersing the same wall-forming polymer(s) of step (a) or different wall-forming polymer(s) with a plasticizer (the same or different as defined above in step (a)) in an organic solvent partially miscible with water such as ethyl acetate<br><br>
or its mixture with ethanol. At this stage, an anti-oxidant may be added to the polymer-plasticizer solution.<br>
In an alternative, in step (g), a wall-forming polymer-mineral material for the next polymeric layer (herein designated "polymer-mineral shell") is prepared by dissolving or dispersing the same wall-forming polymer(s) of step (a) or different wall-forming polymer(s) with at least one mineral that is compatible with the method such as a-modification of boron nitride, magnesium silicate, potassium, sodium, magnesium hydroalumosilicate, mica (and) magnesium myristate, or preferably, titanium dioxide in any of its mineral forms anatase, rutile, brookite or a mixture thereof, or titanium dioxide (and) magnesium myristate, in an organic solvent as defined above. Elefore addition of the mineral, a plasticizer and/or an emulsifier such as Tween-80 can be added to the polymer solution.<br>
Step (h) is a repetition of step (b), in which an aqueous continuous phase is saturated by the same organic solvent (or mixture of solvents) used in step (g) and an appropriate emulsifier, e.g., PVA, is added to the aqueous phase.<br>
Step (i) is a repetition of step (c), in which the polymer-plasticizer solution or polymer-mineral dispersion obtained in step (g) is poured into the aqueous continuous phase of step (h), under agitation, in the presence of an emulsifier (and an antioxidant, if the active ingredient is sensitive to oxidation), to form a polymer-plasticizer emulsion or polymer-mineral suspo-emulsion, respectively.<br>
In step (j), the powdered cores microcapsules of step (f) are immersed in the polymer-plasticizer emulsion or polymer-mineral suspo-emulsion of step (i), thus forming a multi-component emulsion or a new suspo-emulsion, respectively, whereby a formation of "embryo" shells around the core microcapsules is initiated.<br>
In step (k), while stirring, either an excess amount of water is added to the multi-component emulsion or to the new suspo-emulsion obtained in the previous step, or the multi-component emulsion or the new suspo-emulsion is poured into water, optionally containing an emulsifier, preferably PVA, for extraction of the organic solvent from said multi-component emulsion or suspo-emulsion. Preferably, the quantity of water is 10-30 folds compared to the whole quantity of organic<br><br>
solvent. This step is carried out under stirring and incubation for extraction of the solvent and formation of the microcapsules by conversion of the "embryo" shell into a solid polymer wall around the core microcapsule, thus obtaining double-layer microcapsules. The incubation period depends on the desirable size of microcapsules to be obtained.<br>
The double-layer microcapsules are then immersed in an aqueous solution of ethanol (as in step (e) above), in order to remove residual amounts of the organic solvent, separated from the water, e.g., by sedimentation, filtration or centrifugation, and dried. Prior to drying, if desired, the microcapsules may be washed with water and/or water-ethanol solution again in order to remove traces of solvent. For this purpose, the final microcapsules after filtration are immersed in an aqueous solution of 5% ethanol for a period of 2 - 12 hours.<br>
In this way, double-layer microcapsules are obtained. If additional layers are desired, these microcapsules are subjected to a specific surface treatment aimed to increase the polymer adhesion and then additionally coated with one or more outer shells, as described in steps (f) to (1). The outer shell typically has a less porous and smoother spherical surface as compared to the core single-layer microcapsules, and therefore it provides a better protection for the encapsulated active substance. This system enables a controlled release of the encapsulated agent only upon pressing and rubbing the microcapsule on the skin, scalp, teeth or gums.<br>
According to the present invention, the active ingredient to be encapsulated may be an agent having biological activity, an odor agent or a color agent.<br>
The agent having biological activity may be selected from vitamins, natural extracts, individual compounds isolated from natural sources, essential oils, and pharmaceutical agents for topical applications.<br>
The vitamins that can be encapsulated according to the invention include the vitamins A, B, C, D, E, F, K, P, or mixtures thereof.<br>
In one embodiment, the vitamin is vitamin A, either in its free form as Retinol or in its ester form as Retinol Palmitate. The most useable form of the vitamin is Retinol, the active form in the body. Retinol is an anti-oxidant vitamin<br><br><br>
used as nutritional factor and also as an active ingredient of topical/dental products. The activity of one 1U (International Unit) of vitamin AI (equivalent to a USP unit) is 0.3 ug of all-trans Retinol. Retinol can be used for topical treatment oflchthyosis vulgaris (an inherited skin disorder characterized by cornification of the skin) and common acne, and in anti-aging and rejuvenation formulations. However, Retinol (an unsaturated alcohol) is a small and unstable molecule and undergo chemical degradation/oxidation due to its high potential for chemical reactions with other molecules and should be stabilized before using it as an active ingredient in compositions. In order to enjoy the beneficial effects of Retinol and meet the shelf-life needed for topical/dental! compositions, this active principle should be protected from oxidation. Encapsulation of Retinol by the single- or double-layered encapsulation method of the invention with an appropriate shell provides an effective solution for its stabilization and protection. The Retinol microcapsules of the invention are highly compatible with all types of topical/dental formulations and can be used in various applications including, without limiting, dental products, anti-aging products (creams, lotions, serums and masks), skin regeneration formulations, nourishing and moisturizing creams and anti-acne products.<br>
In another embodiment, the vitamin is vitamin C (ascorbic acid), used in recent years as an active ingredient of cosmetics. Due to its antioxidant properties, it is considered to confer both antioxidant and photoprotection to skin against free radical attack and UV ray damage. However, Vitamin C is easily oxidized and, upon storage, exposure to light, oxygen, moisture and/or high temperature, undergoes rapid degradation. It is unstable in aqueous solution, even under neutral pH and at room temperature. The microencapsulation of Vitamin C according to the present invention permits its use as active ingredient in cosmetic composition for use as moisturizing cream, anti-aging cream, anti-wrinkle cream, sunscreen cream, and for stimulating collagen production.<br>
In another embodiment, the vitamin is vitamin E, preferably as a-tocopherol. Tocopherols (Vitamin E) are well-known for their antioxidant properties making vitamin E one of the most widely consumed vitamins. However, vitamin E in its<br><br>
ester form (e.g., tocopherol acetate) is only effective as antioxidant to the formulation, but not to the skin. To be effective as antioxidant to the skin, a-tocopherol has to be used, but it is inherently unstable. The microcapsules of the invention preferably contain stable 25±1% a-tocopherol, and can be used in various types of cosmetic formulations such as sunscreen products, shampoos, conditioners, hair gels, liquid make-up and make-up tissue remover, and release about 95-97% of Vitamin E directly onto the skin/scalp upon application.<br>
In a further embodiment, the vitamin is vitamin F, a mixture of unsaturated fatty acids essential for skin health and functionality, also known as Essential Fatty Acids (EFA; linoleic acid and alpha-linolenic acid.). Vitamin F oxidizes rapidly when incorporated in cosmetic formulation. The microencapsulation according to the invention offers a stable, active and odorless system of Vitamin F suitable for incorporation into moisturizing creams, anti-aging agents and anti-dryness serums. The microcapsules of the invention preferably contain stable 14±o.2% linolenic and linoleic free fatty acids a-tocopherol<br>
In another embodiment, the vitamin is Rutin (quercetin-3-rutinoside or vitamin PI), one of the most active natural flavanoids, highly effective as an antioxidant and free radical scavenger and in the treatment of cellulite due to its ability to control cross-linking of collagen synthesis. Rutin is widely applied in dermatological and cosmetic products due to its beneficial effects on the appearance of healthy skin and is well known for its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and ability to strengthen and modulate the permeability of the walls of the blood vessels including capillaries. However, when incorporated into cosmetic formulations in its non-encapsulated form, Rutin tends to react with other ingredients and oxidizes quickly, resulting in change of the original color of the formulation and loss of its original biological activity. In order to maintain its potent biological activity and prevent its oxidation in cosmetic formulations, Rutin should be stabilized. The Rutin microcapsules of the present invention, developed specifically for topical application in order to stabilize the Rutin, preferably contain a high concentration (about 7%) of pure Rutin Hydrate from plant source.<br><br><br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the active ingredient having biological activity is a natural extract. In cosmetics, a natural extract is assumed to mean ingredients of botanical origin. To be truly natural it must be extracted from the relevant part of the plant without undergoing any significant chemical change. This definition includes plant oils. Any herbal extract or plant oil used for topical application, for example in the cosmetic industry, can be used according to the invention, but preferred herbal extracts and plant oils for encapsulation according to the invention include Licorice root extract, Grape Seed extract, Borage oil, Evening Primrose oil and Hippophae oil.<br>
In one preferred embodiment of the invention, the natural extract is Grape Seed extract (GSE). GSE contains a high content of proanthocyanidins (also known as Oligomeric Proanthocyanidin Complexes or OPCs), a class of nutrients that belong to the flavonoid family and are potent antioxidants and free radical scavengers, reducing the harmful effects of UV radiation. In topical use, a great advantage of OPCs is a substantial increase in blood circulation at the sub-epitopical  level and an improvement of intracellular membrane exchange of micronutrients. The proanthocyanidins (OPCs), however, are not stable and oxidize rapidly due to temperature and  light influence or cross-reactions with other ingredients of topical formulation. The brown color developed in the final product is a result of OPCs oxidation. Encapsulation of GSE according to the present invention prevents oxidative degradation and brown color development, since the polymeric microcapsule walls prevent interaction of Grape Seed extract with other ingredients of the formulation, as well as guarantees the maximum release of OPCs from capsules on the skin upon application with maximum biological affect. The microcapsules    of   the    present    invention    contain    natural    GSE    rich    in proanthocyanidins (min. 95% OPC), preferably about 6% GSE, have a uniform spherical shape with an average size of about 40 microns, and increase the stability and shelf-life of the OPCs, maintain its original activity, and prevents the oxidation and color development in the cosmetic formulation. They are thus indicated as an active ingredient for incorporation in anti-aging creams, in after-sun creams for<br><br>
reduction of skin erythema, in moisturizing and revitalizing products, and in facial sunscreens for prevention of UV-induced lipid oxidation in skin.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the natural extract is Licorice root extract rich in Glabridin, a flavanoid known for its beneficial effects on the skin due to its anti-inflammatory   and   antioxidant   properties.    In   addition,   Glabridin   has whitening/lightening  and  anti-spot properties,   probably  due  to  inhibition  of tyrosinase and melanin synthesis. However, this extract tends to oxidize easily, resulting in a loss of Glabridin's original whitening activity. Moreover, Glabridin, as a flavanoid, is sensitive to pH changes and this factor is the reason for extreme instability of Glabridin in topical formulations, resulting in loss of its original activity and in the development of a dark brown color in formulations. The microcapsules of the present invention contain  Licorice root extract rich in Glabridin. The product is standardized by a content of 4% Glabridin, which is protected by the microcapsules. These microcapsules provide stable lightening/ whitening agent, prevent oxidation of the Glabridin, thereby guaranteeing original activity of Glabridin and providing a longer shelf life of the end product; prevent development of brown color in formulations; are highly stable in a wide pH range; are freely dispersible in all types of cosmetic formulations; and provide a unique control release of the extract only upon application onto the skin. The Licorice Extract microcapsules of the  invention are, therefore,  indicated as an active ingredient in whitening creams and lotions, age-defying creams and serums, anti-spots treatment formulations and lightening hand creams.<br>
In another embodiment, the natural extract is Borage oil, rich in essential fatty acids such as linoleic acid, gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), oleic acid and others, in their triglyceride form, and one of the most concentrated natural forms of GLA. Borage oil is not stable and its active components undergo degradation. The microcapsules of the invention contain about 25% odorless encapsulated Borage oil with increased stability and shelf-life, maintain the GLA in its non-degraded active form, prevent development of distinct malodor during storage of the product, prevent skin irritation, and afford controlled release of high percentage of Borage<br><br>
oil directly to the skin. These microcapsules are indicated as an active ingredient for incorporation in moisturizing creams (especially for dry skin), anti-aging creams, repair formulations, hand creams, and lip-gloss and lip-protecting products.<br>
In another embodiment, the natural extract is Evening Primrose oil (EPO), rich in essential fatty acids such as linoleic acid, gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), oleic acid and others, in their triglyceride form. EPO is not stable and its active components undergo degradation. The microcapsules of the invention contain about 25% odorless encapsulated EPO with increased stability and shelf-life, maintain the GLA in its non-degraded active form, prevent development of distinct malodor during storage of the product, prevent skin irritation, and afford controlled release of high percentage of EPO directly to the skin. These microcapsules are indicated as an active ingredient for incorporation in moisturizing creams (especially for dry skin), anti-wrinkle formulations, repair formulations, hand creams, whitening products, lip-gloss and and lip-protecting products.<br>
In another embodiment, the natural extract is Sea Buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides) oil. This oil contains a unique mix of functional ingredients including a high concentration of carotenoids, palmitoleic acid, sito-sterols and derivatives of vitamins A and E, and is not stable. The microcapsules of the invention contain about 25% encapsulated natural Hippophae oil with increased stability and are indicated for incorporation as an active ingredient in anti-aging products, skin treatment formulations, e.g. after peeling, shaving, burns, etc., sunscreen products, eye-zone formulations, and after-sun products.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention, the active substance to be encapsulated is an individual compound isolated from a natural source such as, but not limited to, a coumarin, a chalcone or a flavonoid selected from the group consisting of flavans, flavanols, flavonols, flavones, flavanones, isoflavones, anthocyanidins, and proanthocyanidins.<br>
It should be understood that an active ingredient used in the present invention may belong to more than one category as defined herein. Thus, Rutin,<br><br>
defined above as Vitamin P, is a flavonoid, as well Glabridin of the Licorice root extract and the proanthocyanidins of the Grape Seed extract.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention, the active substance to be encapsulated is an essential oil. Essential oils are a class of volatile oils extracted from plants, fruits or flowers by steam, distillation or solvent extraction. Examples of essential oils that can be encapsulated according to the invention include Basil Essential Oil, Eucalyptus Essential Oil, Geranium Essential Oil, Grapefruit Essential Oil, Lemon Essential Oil, Peppermint Essential Oil, Tea Tree oil, or mixtures thereof.<br>
In one preferred embodiment, the essential oil is Tea Tree oil, an essential oil<br>
with a fresh camphoraceous odor, extracted from the leaves of the tree Melaleuca<br>
alternifolia. The oil has anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral and<br>
antiparasitic properties. Tea Tree oil is beneficial in softening, regenerating and<br>
purifying the skin and scalp, in healing burns, disinfecting wounds and for treating<br>
spots and insect stings and bites. It is effective against fungal infections such as<br>
candidiasis, vaginal infections, fungal nail infections and for hemorrhoids. As a bath<br>
additive it may control bacteria in spas and pools. It is also known to reduce<br>
hypertrophic scarring and dandruff hair. Tea Tree Oil components include  1-<br>
terpinen-ol, responsible for most of the antimicrobial actions,   1,8-cineole, gamma<br>
terpinene, p-cymene and other terpenes. Tea Tree Oil is not stable and oxidizes and<br>
loses its original activity when incorporated in cosmetic formulations in its naked<br>
form, may cause skin irritation and has a very strong original odor due to its<br>
volatility.   The   microcapsules   of the   invention   contain   about   5%   odorless<br>
encapsulated Tea Tree Oil with increased stability and shelf-life, preventing<br>
oxidation of unstable compounds and development of Tea Tree Oil's strong<br>
malodor in the formulation, and afford controlled release of high percentage of Tea<br>
Tree Oil directly to the skin/scalp. These microcapsules are indicated as an active<br>
ingredient for incorporation in facial care formulations for sensitive and delicate<br>
skin, personal hygiene products and shampoos for damaged and delicate hair, and<br>
anti-dandruff shampoos.<br><br>
In an additional embodiment of the invention, the active ingredient to be encapsulated is a pharmaceutical agent for topical applications, e.g. an antibiotic such as, but not limited to, a macrolide antibiotic selected from Erythromycin, Azithromycin or Clarithromycin. Clarithromycin is a semi-synthetic macrolide antibiotic used to treat certain infections caused by bacteria, such as pneumonia, bronchitis, and infections of the ears, lungs, sinuses, skin, and throat. It also is used to  prevent disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC)  infection in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Clarithromycin is used orally, but   expanding   its   use   for   topical   application   opens   new   possibilities   for administration of this highly potent antibacterial agent with less tolerated drugs such as the tretinoins. Clarithromycin, as many other antibiotics, is very sensitive to degradation due to hydrolysis in water-containing formulations. The Clarithromycin microcapsules of the present invention are specifically developed for topical use and protect the antibiotic from degradation once used in water-containing formulations. In  another embodiment of the  invention, the active  ingredient to be encapsulated is an odor (usually a pleasant odor) agent selected from the group consisting  of fragrances,   perfumes,   essential   oils   and  compounds  extracted therefrom, and volatile natural and synthetic compounds. These agents can be used to impart a pleasant odor to the cosmetic formulation and/or to mask an undesired odor of other components of the formulation.<br>
Agents with odor properties are widely used in topical products. Typically, these agents such as fragrances, perfumes and other volatile materials suffer from instability under specific conditions such as pH of the formulation or they crossreact with other ingredients of the formulation. For these reasons, it is necessary to encapsulate this type of ingredients. The microcapsules of the invention containing a fragrance have been developed specifically in order to solve the above-mentioned problems.<br>
In one preferred embodiment, the volatile compound is Menthol, a monocyclic terpene alcohol obtained from peppermint oil or other mint oils, or prepared synthetically by hydrogenation of thymol. Menthol is a white crystal with<br><br>
a characteristic refreshing mint odor, which provides cosmetic formulations with a fresh sensation, cooling effect, calming qualities and short-term relief. However, Menthol, as a volatile ingredient, has a tendency to evaporate and to change the original content/odor of the formulation. In addition, it is difficult to disperse Menthol homogeneously in cosmetic formulations and usually requires predispersion with ethanol. The precipitation of Menthol from the formulations, its original strong characteristic odor and its potential cross-linking with other ingredients, are reasons that difficult its use in topical/dental products. The odorless Menthol microcapsules of the present invention contain about 10% Menthol. They protect the Menthol from oxidation and maintain its original activity after incorporation into cosmetic formulations. They mask Menthol's characteristic odor while maintaining the original smell, preventing it from reacting with other ingredients in the formulation and providing a long lasting sensation/cooling effect upon application on skin. The microcapsules are homogeneously dispersed in cosmetic formulations without requiring the use of alcohol and are, therefore, indicated as an ingredient for oral hygiene care, e.g. toothpastes, mouth rinses, sunscreen products, cooling after-sun lotions, calming creams and refreshing pre- and after-shave products.<br>
In an additional embodiment of the invention, the active ingredient to be encapsulated is a color agent selected from the group consisting of organic and inorganic pigments, colorants and color agents from natural source.<br>
The color agents that can be used according to the invention include the pigments Carmine, Iron Oxides, Titanium dioxide, and Chrome Oxide/Hydroxide, the colorants D&amp;C Red 21 Aluminum Lake, D&amp;C Red 7 Calcium Lake, D&amp;C Green 6 Liposoluble, and Aluminium Blue #1 (Indigo Carmine Lake). In one preferred embodiment, the pigment is Titanium dioxide (used to lighten other pigments and to lend opacity to formulations) in any one of its mineral forms anatase, brookite or rutile, or mixtures thereof. In another preferred embodiment, the color agent is Iron Oxides, the most widely used of the inorganic pigments, in any of the 3 basic colors - red, black and yellow iron oxides, or mixtures thereof.<br><br>
From these 3 oxides and the addition of Titanium dioxide, any shade of brown (skin tones) can be achieved.<br>

dioxide, boron nitride, magnesium silicate, potassium, sodium, magnesium hydroalumosilicate, mica (and) magnesium myristate, titanium dioxide (and) magnesium myristate, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The active ingredient encapsulated within the double-layer microcapsules may consist of one or more than one active ingredient or said active ingredient may be in mixture with an additive, e.g. an antioxidant.<br>

The present invention affords the production of uniform microcapsules containing a high loading of the active ingredients. The microcapsules are spherical in shape and are suitable, among many other applications, for cosmetic, dermatological, baby care and oral hygiene applications. The microcapsules can be effectively used in topical applications due to the unique ability of the capsules' walls to soften upon rubbing or pressing, e.g. onto the skin or scalp, when used topically, thereby releasing 95-97% of the active ingredient onto the target area.
