butanoi, t-amyl alcohol and tetrahydrofuran.<br>
In the above definitions, unless otherwise stated, an alkyi chain or cycloalkyl<br>
ring may branched or unbranched.<br>
The compound of formula (I) may be isolated and purified by conventional techniques.  For example, when (I) is produced in the form of a salt, by neutralisation of the optionally prediluted reaction mixture, followed by collection of the product by filtration/extraction and optional crystallisation thereof.<br>
Alternatively, the compound of formula (I) may be conveniently isolated and/or purified by standard chromatographic procedures.<br>
The compound of formula (II) required for the preparation of the compound of formula (I) may be obtained by the route depicted in the following reaction scheme using conventional procedures.<br>
SCHEME<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
Thus the compound of formula (IV) may be prepared by chlorosulphonylaticn of 2-ethoxybenzoic acid, i.e. the compound of formula (III). Typically, (III) is added to an ice-cooled mixture of about 1 mol. equiv. of thionyl chloride and about 4 moi. equivs. of chlorosulphonic acid, whilst maintaining the reaction temperature below 25OC; the reaction is then allowed to continue at room temperature until complete<br>
Conversion of (IV) to the compound of formula (V) is achieved by N-sulphonylation of 1-methylpiperazine and may be conducted in a one-step or two-step procedure. In a one-step procedure, about 2.3 mol. equivs. of 1-methylpiperazine are added to an aqueous suspension of (IV) at about 10°C, whilst maintaining the reaction temperature below 20°C; the temperature of the resulting reaction mixture is then held at about 10°C. Alternatively, the quantity of 1-methylpiperazine can be reduced to about 1.1 mol. equiv. by employing about 1 moi. equiv. of sodium hydroxide as auxiliary base.  In a two-step procedure, a solution of (IV) in a suitable solvent, e.g. acetone, is added to a mixture of about a 10% excess of 1-methylpiperazine and about a 10% excess of a suitable acid acceptor, e.g. a tertiary bass; such as triethylamine, whilst maintaining the reaction temperature below 20°C.  When triethylamine is employed as auxiliary basc, an intermediate hydrochloride-triethyiamine double salt of (V), identified as the compound of formula (VA), is isolated. This salt may be transformed to (V) by treatment with water.<br>
A convenient alternative route to (V) is to employ a C1-C4 alkyl 2-ethoxybenzoate (obtained by conventional esterification of (III)) as the chlorosulphonylation substrate, followed by treatment of the resulting sulphonyl chloride with 1-methylpiperazine as described above, then subsequent standard hydrolysis of the ester group.  Other synthetic options for obtaining (V) from salicylic acid and its derivatives will be apparent to the person skilled in the art<br>
Coupling of (V) with the compound of formula (VII) may be achieved by any of the plethora of amide bond-forming reactions well known to those skilled in the<br>
art.  For example, the carboxylic acid function of (V) is first of all activated usinq about a 5% excess of a reagent such as N,N'- carbonyldiimidazole in a suitable solvent, e.g. ethyl acetate, at from about room temperature to about 80°C followed by reaction of the intermediate imidazolide with (VII) at from about 20 to about 60°C.<br>
The aminopyrazole (VII) is obtainable by conventional reduction of the corresponding nitropyrazole (VI), e.g. using palladium-catalysed hydrogenation in a suitable solvent such as ethyl acetate. The resulting solution of (VII) may be used directly, after filtration, in the coupling reaction with (V).<br>
The cyclisation reaction of (II) to provide the compound of formula (I) has been achieved in yields of up to 95%. Thus the over-all yield of (I) based on the benzoic acid derivative (III) as starting material, depending on whether the one-step or two-step sulphonylation procedure is used, can be as high as 51.7% or 47.8% respectively. This compares very favourably with the process disclosed in EP-A-0463756 in which the over-all yield of (!) from 2-ethoxybenzoyl chloride (anc thus from (III) also, assuming that the acid chloride derivative can be generated quantitatively therefrom) is 27.6%.  In an alternative comparison, the over-ai! via-,:: of (l) based on the nitropyrazole (VI) can be as high as 85.2% in the presently disclosed process whilst, in the process disclosed in EP-A-0463756, the over-all yield of (I) from (VI) is 23.1%.<br>
Clearly then, the alternative process to (I) disclosed hereinbefore can be considerably more efficient and advantageous than that previously disclosed, and the intermediates of formulae (II), (V) and (VA) also form part of the invention.<br>
Alternatively, the cyclisation of a compound of formula (II) to a compound of formula (I) may be conducted under neutral or acidic conditions.<br>
Under neutral conditions, the compound of formula (II) is heated, optionally in the presence of a solvent and/or optionally in the presence of a dehvdratina agent and/or mechanical water-removal system, e.g. a Dean-Stark apparatus<br>
A suitable solvent may be selected from the group consisting of 1,2-dichlorobenzene, dimethyl sulphoxide, sulpholane, N-methylpyrroiidin-2-one and pyrrolidin-2-one, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Preferably the solvent is 1,2-dichlorobenzene, sulpholane or N-methylpyrrolidin-2-one.<br>
A suitable dehydrating agent may be selected from the group consisting of anhydrous potassium carbonate, anhydrous sodium carbonate, anhydrous magnesium sulphate, anhydrous sodium sulphate, phosphorus pentoxide and molecular sieves.<br>
Preferably the dehydrating agent is molecular sieves.<br>
Preferably also, the reaction is carried out at from 180 to 220°C for from 0.5 to 72 hours.<br>
Under acidic conditions, the cyclisation is carried out by reaction of a compound of formula (II) with a protic acid or Lewis acid, optionally in the presence of a solvent.<br>
A suitable protic acid may be selected from the group consisting of an inorganic acid, an organo-suiphonic acid, an organo-phosphonic acid and an organo-carboxylic acid.<br>
Preferably the protic acid is concentrated sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid or p-toluenesulphonic acid.<br>
A suitable Lewis acid may be selected from the group consisting of boron trifluoride, boron trichloride, boron tribromide, aluminium chloride, aluminium bromide, silicon tetrachloride, silicon tetrabromide, stannic chloride, stannic bromide, phosphorus pentachloride, phosphorus pentabromide, titanium tetrafluoride, titanium tetrachloride, titanium tetrabromide, ferric chloride, zinc fluoride, zinc chloride, zinc bromide, zinc iodide, mercuric chloride, mercuric bromide and mercuric iodide.<br>
Preferably the Lewis acid is boron trifluoride, aluminium chloride, silicon tetrachloride, stannic chloride, titanium tetrachloride, ferric chloride or zinc • chloride'.<br>
A suitable solvent may be selected from the group consisting of a C5-C12 alkane, a C5-C8 cycloalkane, a C1-C12 alkanoic acid, a C1-C4 alkanol, aC1-C9 alkanone, a C5-C12 alkyl ether, 1,2-dimethoxyethane, 1,2-diethoxyethane, diglyme, tetrahydrofuran, 1,4-dioxan, benzene, toluene, xylene, chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene, nitrobenzene, dichloromethane, dibromomethane, 1,2-dichloroethane, acetonitrile, dimethyl sulphoxide, sulpholane, dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, N-methylpyrrolidin-2-one and pyrrolidin-2-one, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Preferably the solvent is glacial acetic acid, tetrahydrofuran, 1,4-dioxan or chlorobenzene.<br>
Preferably also, the reaction is carried out at from 65 to 210°C for from 6 to 300 hours.<br>
The syntheses of the compound of formula (I) and the intermediates thereto are described in the following Examples and Preparations.  In cases where the compound of formula (I) was not isolated and (if necessary) purified, the yields ':hereof were determined, and reaction mixtures analysed, by quantitative thin layer chromatography (TLC), using Merck silica gel 60 plates and toluene:methylated spirit:0880 aqueous ammonia mixtures as solvent systems, and/or high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), using Gilson equipment with a 15 cm reverse phase C18 column and triethy!amine:phosphoric acid buffer in aqueous acetonitrile:methano! mixtures as mobile phases.<br>

Characteristic chemical shifts (5) are given in parts-per-millicn downfield from tetramethylsiiane using conventional abbreviations for designation of significant peaks: e.g. s, singlet; d, doublet; t, triplet; q, quartet; h, hextet; m, multiplet; br, broad.<br>
