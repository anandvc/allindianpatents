REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Patent Application No. 09/429,609, filed October<br>
29, 1999, currently pending, which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Patent Application No.<br>
08/817,368, filed July 17, 1997, now U.S. Patent No. 6,023,665, which is the U.S. national stage<br>
of PCT International Application No. PCT/SE94/00968, filed October 14,1994, published April<br>
25, 1996, as WO 96/12265 Al. The disclosures of the parent applications are hereby<br>
incorporated by reference in their entireties into the present disclosure.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to systems for locating, identifying and tracking objects. More<br>
particularly, it related to aircraft location, identification and docking guidance systems and to<br>
ground traffic control methods for locating and identifying objects on an airfield and for safely<br>
and efficiently docking aircraft at such airport.<br>
Description of Related Art<br>
In recent years there has been a significantly increased amount of passenger, cargo and<br>
other aircraft traffic including take offs, landings and other aircraft ground traffic. Also, there<br>
has been a marked increase in the number of ground support vehicles which are required to off<br>
load cargo, provide catering services and on going maintenance and support of all aircraft. With<br>
that substantial increase in ground traffic has come a need for greater control and safety in the<br>
docking and identification, of aircraft on an airfield.<br>
Exemplary of prior art systems which have been proposed for detecting the presence of<br>
aircraft and other traffic on an airfield are those systems disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,995,102;<br>
European Patent No. 188 757: and PCT Published Applications WO 93/13104 and WO<br>
93/15416.<br>
However, none of those systems have been found to be satisfactory for detection of the<br>
presence of aircraft on an airfield, particularly, under adverse climatic conditions causing<br>
diminished visibility such as encountered under fog, snow or sleet conditions. Furthermore, none<br>
of the systems disclosed in the prior references are capable of identifying and verifying the<br>
specific type of an approaching aircraft. Still further, none of the prior systems provide adequate<br>
techniques for tracking and docking an aircraft at a designated stopping point such as an airport<br>
loading gate. Also, none of the prior systems have provided techniques which enable adequate<br>
calibration of the instrument therein.<br>
The system disclosed in the above-cited parent application seeks to overcome the above-<br>
noted problems though profile matching. Light pulses from a laser range finder (LRF) are<br>
projected in angular coordinates onto the airplane. The light pulses are reflected off the airplane<br>
to detect a shape of the airplane or of a portion of the airplane, e.g., the nose. The detected shape<br>
is compared with a profile corresponding to the shape of a known model of airplane to determine<br>
whether the detected shape corresponds to the shape of the known model.<br>
However, that system has a drawback. Often, two or more models of airplanes have nose<br>
profiles so similar that one model is often misidentified as another. In particular, in adverse<br>
weather, many echoes are lost, so that profile discrimination becomes decreasingly reliable.<br>
Since the models are similar but not identical in body configuration, a correct docking position<br>
for one can cause an engine on another to crash into a physical obstacle.<br>
Thus, it has been a continuing problem to provide systems which are sufficiently safe and<br>
reliable over a wide range of atmospheric conditions to enable detection of objects such as<br>
aircraft and other ground traffic on an airfield.<br>
In addition, there has been a long standing need for systems which are not only capable<br>
of detecting objects such as aircraft, but which also provide for the effective identification of the<br>
detected object and verification of the identity of such object, for example, a detected aircraft<br>
with the necessary degree of certainty regardless of prevailing weather conditions and magnitude<br>
of ground traffic.<br>
There has also been a long standing, unfulfilled need for systems which are capable of<br>
accurately and efficiently tracking and guiding objects such as incoming aircraft to a suitable<br>
stopping point such as an airport loading gate. In addition, the provision of accurate and<br>
effective calibration techniques for such systems has been a continuing problem requiring<br>
resolution.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It will be readily apparent from the above that a need exists in the art for a more accurate<br>
identification of aircraft.<br>
It is therefore a primary object of the invention to distinguish among multiple models of<br>
aircraft with identical or almost identical nose shapes.<br>
It is a further object of the invention to improve the detection of aircraft so as to avoid<br>
accidents during aircraft docking.<br>
To achieve the above and other objects, the present invention identifies aircraft in a two-<br>
step process. First, the profile matching is performed as known from the above-identified parent<br>
application. Second, at least one aircraft criterion matching is performed. In the aircraft criterion<br>
matching, a component of the aircraft, such as the engine, is selected as a basis for distinguishing<br>
among aircraft. The displacement of that component from another, easily located component,<br>
such as the nose, is determined in the following manner. An inner volume in which the engine<br>
is expected is defined, and an outer volume surrounding the inner volume is also defined. The<br>
LRF is directed at the inner and outer volumes to produce echoes from both volumes. A ratio<br>
is taken of the number of echoes in the inner volumes to the number of echoes in both volumes.<br>
If that echo exceeds a given threshold, the engine is determined to be present in the inner volume,<br>
and the aircraft is considered to be identified. If the identification of the aircraft is still<br>
ambiguous, another aircraft criterion, such as the tail, can be detected.<br>
The aircraft criteria chosen for the second phase of the identification are physical<br>
differences that can be detected by a laser range finder. An example of such a criterion is the<br>
position, sideways and lengthwise, of an engine in relation to the aircraft nose. To consider an<br>
aircraft identified, the echo pattern must not only reflect a fuselage of correct shape. It must also<br>
reflect that there is an engine at a position, relative to the nose, where the expected aircraft does<br>
have an engine. Other examples of criteria that can be used are the position of the main gear, the<br>
position of the wings and the position of the tail.<br>
The matching is preferably done only against the criteria specific for the expected aircraft<br>
type. It would be very time consuming to match against the criteria of all other possible types.<br>
Such matching would have to be against every type of aircraft that may land at a specific airport.<br>
For each gate there is a defined a stopping position for each aircraft type that is planned<br>
to dock at that gate. There might be a safety risk for any other type to approach the gate. The<br>
stopping position is defined so that there is a sufficient safety margin between the gate and the<br>
aircraft to avoid collision. The stopping position for each aircraft type is often defined as the<br>
position of the nose gear when the door is in appropriate position in relation to the gate. There<br>
is a database in the system where the distance from the nose to the nose gear is stored for each<br>
aircraft type. The docking system guides the aircraft with respect to its nose position and stops<br>
the aircraft with its nose in a position where the correct type will have its nose gear in the correct<br>
stop position. If the wrong type is docked and if it has its wings or engines closer to the nose than<br>
the correct type, there is a risk of collision with the gate.<br>
During the aircraft criteria phase, all aircraft criteria specified for the expected aircraft<br>
type can be checked. If an aircraft has a profile that can be used to discriminate it from any other<br>
type, which is rarely the case, the profile will be the only aircraft criterion. Otherwise, another<br>
criterion such as the position of the engine is checked, and if the identification is still ambiguous,<br>
still another criterion such as the position of the tail is checked.<br>
The LRF is directed to obtain echoes from the inner and outer volumes. If the ratio of<br>
the number of echoes from within the inner volume to the number of echoes from within both<br>
volumes is larger than a threshold value, the aircraft is identified as having an engine at the right<br>
position, and that specific criterion is thus fulfilled. The ratio of the echo numbers is. however,<br>
just an example of a test used to evaluate the presence of an engine at the right position or to<br>
determine whether the echoes come from some other source, e.g., a wing. In cases in which that<br>
is the only criterion, the aircraft is considered to be identified. Otherwise, the other specified<br>
criteria (e.g., the height of the nose of the aircraft or evaluation of another aircraft criterion) have<br>
to be fulfilled.<br>
If necessary, several characteristics, such as the tail, gears, etc., can be used to identify<br>
one specific type. The inner and outer volumes are then defined for each geometrical<br>
characteristic to be used for the identification. The exact extension of the volumes is dependent<br>
on the specific aircraft type and so is the threshold value.<br>
A further identification criterion is the; nose height. The nose height is measured so as<br>
to allow the horizontal scan to be placed over the tip of the nose. The measured nose height is<br>
also compared with the height of the expected aircraft. If the two differ by more than 0.5 m, the<br>
aircraft is considered to be of wrong type, and the docking is stopped. The value 0.5 m is given<br>
by the fact that the ground height often varies along the path of the aircraft which makes it<br>
difficult to measure with higher accuracy.<br>
The invention lends itself to the use of "smart" algorithms which minimize the demand<br>
on the signal processing at the same time as they minimize the effect of adverse weather and bad<br>
reflectivity of aircraft surface. The advantage is that low-cost microcomputers can be used,<br>
and/or computer capacity is freed for other tasks, and that docking is possible under almost all<br>
weather conditions.<br>
One important algorithm in that respect is the algorithm for handling of the reference<br>
profiles. The profile information is stored as a set of profiles. Each profile in the set reflects the<br>
expected echo pattern for the aircraft at a certain distance from the system. The position of an<br>
aircraft is calculated by calculating the distance between the achieved echo pattern with the<br>
closest reference profile. The distance interval between the profiles in the set is chosen so short<br>
that the latter calculation can be made using approximations and still maintain the necessary<br>
accuracy. Instead of using scaling with a number of multiplications, which is a demanding<br>
operation, simple addition and subtraction can be used.<br>
Another important algorithm is the algorithm for determining an aircraft"s lateral<br>
deviation from its appropriate path. That algorithm uses mainly additions and subtractions and<br>
only very few multiplications and divisions. The calculation is based on areas between the<br>
reference profile and the echo pattern. As those areas are not so much affected by position<br>
variationsor absence of individual echoes the algorithm becomes very insensitive to disturbances<br>
due to adverse weather.<br>
The calibration procedure enables a calibration check against an object at the side of the<br>
system. The advantage is that such a calibration check is possible also when no fixed object is<br>
available in front of the system. In most cases, there are no objects in front of the system that can<br>
be used. It is very important to make a calibration check regularly. Something might happen to<br>
the system, e.g., such that the aiming direction of the system is changed. That can be due to an<br>
optical or mechanical error inside the system or it can be due to a misalignment caused by an<br>
external force such as from a passing truck. If that happens, the system may guide an aircraft to<br>
a collision with objects at the side of its appropriate path.<br>
Another useful aspect of the present invention is that it can easily be adapted to take into<br>
account the yaw angle of the aircraft. The yaw angle is useful to know for two reasons. First,<br>
knowledge of the yaw angle facilitates accurate docking of the aircraft. Second, once the yaw<br>
angle is determined, the profile is rotated accordingly, for more accurate matching.<br>
In the verification process it is determined whether certain geometric characteristics, such<br>
as an engine, are present in a certain position, e.g., relative to the nose. If the aircraft is directed<br>
at an angle towards the docking guidance system (DGS), which is often the case, that angle has<br>
to be known, in order to know where to look for the characteristics. The procedure is as follows:<br>
1. Convert the polar coordinates (angle, distance) of the echoes to Cartesian coordinates<br>
(x,y)-<br>
2. Calculate the yaw angle.<br>
3. Rotate the echo profile to match the yaw angle calculated for the aircraft.<br>
4. Determine the existence of the ID characteristics.<br>
The yaw angle is typically calculated through a technique which involves finding<br>
regression angles on both sides of the nose of the aircraft. More broadly, the geometry of the part<br>
of the aircraft just behind the nose is used. Doing so was previously considered to be impossible.<br>
Still another aspect of the invention concerns the center lines painted in the docking ara.<br>
Curved docking center lines are painted as the correct path for the nose wheel to follow, which<br>
is not the path for the nose. If a DGS does not directly measure the actual position of the nose<br>
wheel, the yaw angle is needed to calculate it based on measured data, such as the position of the<br>
nose. The position of the nose wheel in relation to the curved center line can then be calculated.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Reference is now made to Figures 1-22 and Tables I-II, in which like numerals designate<br>
like elements throughout the several views. Throughout the following detailed description,<br>
numbered stages depicted in the illustrated flow diagrams are generally indicated by element<br>
number in parenthesis following such references.<br>
Referring to Fig. 1, the docking guidance systems of the present invention generally<br>
designated 10 in the drawings provide for the computerized location of an object, verification of<br>
the identity of the object and tracking of the object, the object preferably being an aircraft 12.<br>
In operation, once the control tower 14 lands an aircraft 12, it informs the system that a plan is<br>
approaching gate 16 and the type of aircraft (i.e., 747, L-1011, etc.) expected. The system 10<br>
then scans the area in front of the gate 16 until it locates an object that it identifies as an airplane<br>
12. The system 10 then compares the measured profile of the aircraft 12 with a reference profile<br>
for the expected type of aircraft and evaluates other geometric criteria characteristic of the<br>
expected aircraft type. If the located aircraft does not match the expected profile and the other<br>
criteria, the system informs or signals the tower 14 and shuts down.<br>
If the object is the expected aircraft 12, the system 10 tracks it into the gate 16 by .<br>
displaying in real time to the pilot the distance remaining to the proper stopping point 29 and the<br>
lateral position 31 of the plane 12. The lateral position 31 of the plane 12 is provided on a<br>
display 18 allowing the pilot to correct the position of the plane to approach the gate 16 from the<br>
correct angle. Once the airplane 12 is at its stopping point 53, that fact is shown on the display<br>
18 and the pilot stops the plane.<br>
Referring to Fig. 2, the system 10 includes a Laser Range Finder (LRF) 20, two mirrors<br>
21, 22, a display unit 18, two step motors 24, 25, and a microprocessor 26. Suitable LRF<br>
products for use herein are sold by Laser Atlanta Corporation and are capable of emitting laser<br>
pulses and receiving the reflections of those pulses reflected off of distant objects and computing<br>
the distance to those objects.<br>
The system 10 is arranged such that there is a connection 28 between the serial port of<br>
the LRF 20 and the microprocessor 26. Through that connection, the LRF 20 sends measurement<br>
data approximately every 1/400th of a second to the microprocessor 26. The hardware<br>
components generally designated 23 of the system 20 are controlled by the programmed<br>
microprocessor 26. In addition, the microprocessor 26 feeds data to the display 18. As the<br>
interface to the pilot, the display unit 18 is placed above the gate 16 to show the pilot how far the<br>
plane is from its stopping point 29. the type of aircraft 30 the system believes is approaching and<br>
the lateral location of the plane 31. Using thait display, the pilot can adjust the approach of the<br>
plane 12 to the gate 16 to ensure the plane is on the correct angle to reach the gate. If the display<br>
18 shows the wrong aircraft type 30, the pilot can abort the approach before any damage is done.<br>
That double check ensures the safety of the passengers, plane and airport facilities because if the<br>
system tries to dock a larger 747 at a gate where a 737 is expected, it likely will cause extensive<br>
damage.<br>
In addition to the display 18, the microprocessor 26 processes the data from LRF 20 and<br>
controls the direction of the laser 20 through its connection 32 to the step motors 24, 25. The<br>
step motors 24,25 are connected to the mirrors 21,22 and move them in response to instructions<br>
from the microprocessor 26. Thus, by controlli ng the step motors 24,25, the microprocessor 26<br>
can change the angle of the mirrors 21, 22 and aim the laser pulses from the LRF 20.<br>
The mirrors 21, 22 aim the laser by reflecting the laser pulses outward over the tarmac<br>
of the airport. In the preferred embodiment, the LRF 20 does not move. The scanning by the<br>
laser is done with mirrors. One mirror 22 controls the horizontal angle of the laser while the<br>
other mirror 21 controls the vertical angle. By activating the step motors 24, 25, the<br>
microprocessor 26 controls the angle of the mirrors and thus the direction of the laser pulse.<br>
The system 10 controls the horizon! al mirror 22 to achieve a continuous horizontal<br>
scanning within a ±10 degree angle in approximately 0.1 degree angular steps which are<br>
equivalent to 16 microsteps per step with the Escap EDM-453 step motor. One angular step is<br>
taken for each reply from the reading unit, i.e., approximately every 2.5 ms. The vertical mirror<br>
21 can be controlled to achieve a vertical scan between +20 and -30 degrees in approximately<br>
0.1 degree angular steps with one step every 2.5 ms. The vertical mirror is used to scan vertically<br>
when the nose height is being determined and when the aircraft 12 is being identified. During<br>
the tracking mode, the vertical mirror 21 is continuously adjusted to keep the horizontal scan<br>
tracking the nose tip of the aircraft 12.<br>
Referring to Fig. 3, the system 10 divides the field in front of it by distance into three<br>
parts. The farthest section, from about 50 meters out, is the capture zone 50. In that zone 50, the<br>
system 10 detects the aircraft"s nose and makes a rough estimate of lateral and longitudinal<br>
position of the aircraft 12. Inside the capture zone 50 is the identification area 51. In that area,<br>
the system 10 checks the profile of the aircraft 12 against a stored profile 51. In that area, the<br>
system 10 checks the profile of the aircraft 12 in that region, related to a predetermined line, on<br>
the display 18. Finally, nearest to the LRF 20 is the display or tracking area 52. In the display<br>
area 52, the system 10 displays the lateral and longitudinal position of the aircraft 12 relative to<br>
the correct stopping position with its highest degree of accuracy. At the end of the display area<br>
52 is the stopping point 53. At the stopping point 53, the aircraft will be in the correct position<br>
at the gate 16.<br>
In addition to the hardware and software, the system 10 maintains a database containing<br>
reference profiles for any type of aircraft it might encounter. Within that database, the system<br>
stores the profile for each aircraft type as a horizontal and vertical profile reflecting the expected<br>
echo pattern for that type of aircraft.<br>
Referring to Table I, the system maintains the horizontal profile in the form of a Table<br>
I whose rows 40 are indexed by angular step and whose columns 41 are indexed by distance from<br>
the stopping position for that type of aircraft. In addition to the indexed rows, the table contains<br>
a row 42 providing the vertical angle to the nose of the plane at each distance from the LRF a<br>
row 44 providing the form factor, k, for the profile and a row 45 providing the number of profile<br>
values for each profile distance. The body 43 of the Table I contains expected distances for that<br>
type of aircraft at various scanning angles and distances from the stopping point 53.<br>
Theoretically, the 50 angular steps and the 50 distances to the stopping point 53 would<br>
require a Table I containing 50 x 50, or 2500, entries. However, Table I will actually contain far<br>
fewer entries because the profile will not expect a return from all angles at all distances. It is<br>
expected that a typical table will actually contain between 500 and 1000 values. Well known<br>
programming techniques provide methods of maintaining a partially full table without using the<br>
memory required by a full table.<br>
In addition to the horizontal profile, the system 10 maintains a vertical profile of each<br>
type of aircraft. That profile is stored in the same manner as the horizontal profile, except that<br>
its rows are indexed by angular steps in the vertical direction and its column index contains fewer<br>
distances from the stopping position than the horizontal profile. The vertical profile requires<br>
fewer columns because it is used only for identifying the aircraft 12 and for determining its nose<br>
height, which take place at a defined range of distances from the LRF 20 in the identification area<br>
51. Consequently, the vertical profile stores only the expected echoes in that range without<br>
wasting data storage space on unneeded values.<br>
The system 10 uses the previously described hardware and database to locate, identify<br>
and track aircraft using the following procedures:<br>
Referring to Figs. 4A and 4B, the software running on the microprocessor performs a<br>
main routine containing subroutines for the calibration mode 60, capture mode 62 and docking<br>
mode 400. The microprocessor first performs the calibration mode 60, then the capture mode<br>
62 and then the docking mode 400. Once the aircraft 12 is docked, the program finishes. Those<br>
modes are described in greater detail as follows:<br>
Calibration Mode<br>
To ensure system accuracy, the microprocessor 26 is programmed to calibrate itself in<br>
accordance with the procedure illustrated in Fig. 5 before capturing an aircraft 12 and at various<br>
intervals during tracking. Calibrating the system 10 ensures that the relationship between the<br>
step motors 24,25 and the aiming direction is known. The length measuring ability of the LRF<br>
20 is also checked.<br>
Referring to Fig. 6, for calibration, the system 10 uses a square plate 66 with a known<br>
position. The plate 66 is mounted 6 meters from the LRF 20 and at the same height as the LRF<br>
20.<br>
To calibrate, the system sets (a,p) to (0,0), causing the laser to be directed straight<br>
forward. The vertical mirror 22 is then tilted such that the laser beam is directed backwards to<br>
a rear or extra mirror 68 which redirects the beam to the calibration plate 66. (100) The<br>
microprocessor 26 then uses the step motors 24. 25, to move the mirrors 21,22 until it finds the<br>
center of the calibration plate 66. Once it finds the center of the calibration plate 66, thg<br>
microprocessor 26 stores the angles (acp, ßcp) at that point and compares them to stored expected<br>
angles. (102) The system 10 also compares the reported distance to the plate 66 center with a<br>
stored expected value. (102) If the reported values do not match the stored values, the<br>
microprocessor 26 changes the calibration constants, which determine the expected values, until<br>
they do. (104, 106) However, if any of those values deviate too much from the values stored at<br>
installation, an alarm is given. (108)<br>
Capture Mode<br>
Initially, the airport tower 14 notifies the system 10 to expect an incoming airplane 12<br>
and the type of airplane to expect. That signal puts the software into a capture mode 62 as<br>
outlined in Fig. 7. In capture mode 62, the microprocessor 26 uses the step motors 24, 25 to<br>
direct the laser to scan the capture zone 50 horizontally for the plane 12. That horizontal scan<br>
is done at a vertical angle corresponding to the height of the nose of the expected type of aircraft<br>
at the midpoint of the capture zone 50.<br>
To determine the correct height to scan, the microprocessor 26 computes the vertical<br>
angle for the laser pulse as:<br>
ßf=arctan[(H-h)//f]<br>
where H = the height of the LRF 20 above the ground, h = the nose height of the expected<br>
aircraft, and /f = the distance from the LRF 20 to the middle of the capture zone 50. That<br>
equation results in a vertical angle for the mirror 21 that will enable the search to be at the correct<br>
height at the middle of the capture zone 50 for the expected airplane 12.<br>
Alternatively, the system 10 can store in the database values for P/for different types of<br>
aircraft at a certain distance. However, storing ßr limits the flexibility of the system 10 because<br>
it can capture an aircraft 12 only a single distance from the LRF 20<br>
In the capture zone 50 and using that vertical angle, the microprocessor 26 directs the<br>
laser to scan horizontally in pulses approximately 0.1 degree apart. The microprocessor 26 scans<br>
horizontally by varying a. the horizontal angle from a center line starting from the LRF 20,<br>
between ±amax, a value defined at installation. Typically, amax is set to 50 which, using 0.1 degree<br>
pulses, is equivalent to 5 degrees and results in a 10 degree scan.<br>
The release of the laser pulses results in echoes or reflections from objects in the capture<br>
zone 50. The detection device of the LRF 20 captures the reflected pulses, computes the distance<br>
to the object from the time between pulse transmission and receipt of the echo, and sends the<br>
calculated distance value for each echo to the microprocessor 26. The micro processor 26 stores,<br>
in separate registers in a data storage device, the total number of echoes or hits in each 1 degree<br>
sector of the capture zone 50. (70) Because the pulses are generated in 0.1 degree intervals, up<br>
to ten echoes can occur in each sector. The microprocessor 26 stores those hits in variables<br>
entitled sa where a varies from 1 to 10 to reflect each one degree slice of the ten degree capture<br>
zone 50.<br>
In addition to storing the number of hits per sector, the microprocessor 26 stores, again<br>
in a data storage device, the distance from the LRF 20 to the object for each hit or echo. Storing<br>
the distance to each reflection requires a storage medium large enough to store up to ten hits in<br>
each 1 degree of the capture zone 50 or up to 100 possible values. Because, in many cases, most<br>
of the entries will be empty, well known programming techniques an reduce those storage<br>
requirements below having 100 registers always allocated for those values.<br>
Once that data is available for a scan, the microprocessor 26 computes the total number<br>
of echoes, ST in the scan by summing the sa"s. The microprocessor 26 then computes SA/S, the<br>
largest sum of echoes in three adjacent sectors. (72) In other words, SY is the largest sum of (Sa-1,, <br>
Sa, Sa+1)-<br>
Once it computes SMand SI the microprocessor 26 determines whether the echoes are<br>
from an incoming airplane 12. If SMis not greater than 24, no airplane 12 has been found and <br>
the microprocessor 26 returns to the beginning of the capture mode 62. If the largest sum of <br>
echoes, SM is greater than 24 (74), a "possible" airplane 12 has been located. If a "possible" <br>
airplane 12 has been located, the microprocessor checks if SA/S T is greater than 0.5 (76), or the<br>
three adjacent sectors with the largest sum contain at least half of all the echoes received during<br>
the scan.<br>
If SM /SM is greater than 0.5, the microprocessor 26 calculates the location of the center <br>
of the echo. (78, 82) The angular location of the center of the echo is calculated as:<br>
a, = av + (Sa+1 - Sa-1)/(Sa-2 + Sa + Sa+1.,)<br>
where Sa is the Sa that gave SM and txv is the angular sector that corresponds to that Sa. <br>
The longitudinal position of the center of the echo is calculated as<br><br><br>
where the /avi are the measured values, or distances to the object, for the pulses that returned an<br>
echo from the sector av and where n is the total number of measured values in that sector. (78,<br>
82) Because the largest possible number of measured values is ten, n must be less than or equal<br>
to ten.<br>
However, if S M/ST 
close range. If the cause is an aircraft at close range, that aircraft is probably positioned fairly<br>
close to the centerline so it is assumed that at should be zero instead of the above calculated<br>
value and that /, should be the mean distance given by the three middle sectors. (80) If the<br>
distance distribution is too large, the microprocessor 26 has not found an airplane 12 and it<br>
returns to the beginning of the capture mode 62. (81).<br>
After calculating the position of the aircraft 12, the system 10 switches to"docking mode<br>
400.<br>
Docking Mode<br>
The docking mode 400 illustrated in Figs. 4A and 4B includes four phases, the tracking<br>
phase 84, the height measuring phase 86, the profile recognition phase 404, and the aircraft<br>
criteria phase 408. In the tracking phase 84, the system 10 monitors the position of the incoming<br>
aircraft 12 and provides the pilot with information about axial location 31 and distance from the<br>
stopping point 53 of the plane through the display 18. The system 10 begins tracking the aircraft<br>
12 by scanning horizontally.<br>
Referring to Fig. 8, during the first scan in tracing phase, the microprocessor 26 directs<br>
the LRF 20 to send out laser pulses in single angular steps, a or, preferably, at 0.1 degree<br>
intervals between (a, - ap - 10) and (a, + ap + 10), where a, is determined during the capture<br>
mode 62 as the angular position of the echo center and ap is the largest angular position in the<br>
current profile column that contains distance values.<br>
After the first scan, a is stepped back and forth with one step per received LRF value<br>
between (as - ap - 10) and (as + ap + 10), where as is the angular position of the azimuth<br>
determined during the previous scan.<br>
During the tracking phase 84, the vertical angle ß is set to the level required for the<br>
identified craft 12 at its current distance from the LRF 20 which is obtained from the reference<br>
profile Table I. The current profile column is the column representing a position less than but<br>
closer to /,.<br>
The microprocessor 26 uses the distance from the stopping point 53 to find the vertical<br>
angle for the airplane"s current distance on the profile Table I. During the first scan, the<br>
distance, lo calculated during the capture mode 62, determines the appropriate column of the<br>
profile Table I and thus the angle to the aircraft 12. For each subsequent scan, the<br>
microprocessor 26 uses the ß in the column of the profile Table I reflecting the present distance<br>
from the stopping point 53. (112)<br>
Using the data from the scans and the data on the horizontal profile Table I, the<br>
microprocessor 26 creates a Comparison Table II. The Comparison Table II is a two dimensional<br>
" table with the number of the pulse, or angular step number, as the index 91, i, to the rows. Using<br>
that index, the following information, represented as columns of the table, can be accessed for<br>
each row: lt 92, the measured distance to the obj ect on that angular step; /k 93, the measured value<br>
compensated for the skew caused by the displacement (equal to I, minus the quality sm, the total<br>
displacement during the last scan, minus the quality i times sp, the average displacement during<br>
each step in the last scan, i.e., lr(sm-isp)); di 94, the distance between the generated profile and<br>
the reference profile (equal to x,y, the profile value for the corresponding angle at the profile<br>
distance j minus Iki); a, 95, the distance the nose of the aircraft and the measuring equipment<br>
(equal to rj50, the reference profile value at zero degrees, minus d,); ac 96, the estimated nose<br>
distance after each step (equal to a^, the nose distance at the end of the last scan, minus the<br>
quantity i times sp); ad, the difference between the estimated and measured nose distance (equal<br>
to the absolute value of ^ minus a,.); and Note 97 which indicates the echoes that are likely<br>
caused by an aircraft.<br>
During the first scan in the tracking phase 84. the system 10 uses the horizontal profile<br>
column representing an aircraft position, j, less than but closest to the value of/,. For each new<br>
scan, the profile column whose value is less; than but closest to (a - sm ) is chosen where am is<br>
the last measured distance to the aircraft 12 and sm is the aircraft"s displacement during the last<br>
scan. Additionally, the values of the profile are shifted sideways by as to compensate for the<br>
lateral position of the aircraft. (112)<br>
During each scan, the microprocessor 26 also generates a Distance Distribution Table<br>
(DDT). That table contains the distribution of a si value as they appear in the Comparison Table<br>
II. Thus, the DDT has an entry representing the number of occurrences of each value of a; in the<br>
Comparison Table II in 1 meter increments between 10 to 100 meters.<br>
After every scan, the system 10 uses the DDT to calculate the average distance a,,,, to the<br>
correct stopping point 53. The microprocessor 26 scans the data in the DDT to find the two<br>
adjacent entries in the DDT for which the sum of their values is the largest. The microprocessor<br>
26 then flags the Note 97 column in the Comparison Table II for each row containing an entry<br>
for aj corresponding to either of the two DDT rows having the largest sum. (114)<br>
The system 10 then determines the lateral deviation of offset. (116) The microprocessor<br>
26 first sets:<br>
2d = a,max - amin<br>
where amax and amin are the highest and lowest a values for a continuous flagged block<br>
of di values in the Comparison Table II. Additionally, the microprocessor 26 calculates:<br>
for the upper half of the flagged dj in the block and:<br>
___Y2= Sd1<br>
for the lower half of the block. Using Y, and Y2 "a" 116 is calculated as:<br>
a - k x (Y, - Y, )/d2<br>
where k is given in the reference profile. If "a" exceeds a given value, preferably set to one, it<br>
is assumed that there is a lateral deviation approximately equal to "a". The /i- column of the<br>
Comparison Table II is then shifted "a" steps and the Comparison Table II is recalculated. The<br>
process continues until "a" is smaller than an empirically established value, preferably one. The<br>
total shift, as, of the I, column is considered equal to the lateral deviation or offset. (116) If the<br>
lateral offset is larger than a predetermined value, preferably set to one, the profile is adjusted<br>
sideways before the next scan. (118, 120)<br>
After the lateral offset is checked, the microprocessor 26 provides the total sideways<br>
adjustment of the profile, which corresponds to the lateral position 31 of the aircraft 12, on the<br>
display 18. (122)<br>
The microprocessor 26 next calculates the distance to the nose of the aircraft, am<br>
an, = S(flagged aj)/N<br>
where N is the total number of flagged a;. From a,,,, the microprocessor 26 can calculate the<br>
distance from the plane 12 to the stopping point 53 by subtracting the distance from the LRF 20<br>
to the stopping point 53 from the distance of the nose of the aircraft. (124)<br>
Once it calculates the distance to the stopping point 53, the microprocessor 26 calculates<br>
the average displacement during the last scan, sm. The displacement during the last scan is<br>
calculated as:<br>
where am-1, and a,,, belong to the last two scans. For the first scan in tracking phase 84, Sm is set<br>
to O.<br>
The average displacement during each step is calculated as:<br>
Sp.Sm/P<br>
where P is the total number of steps for the last scan cycle.<br>
The microprocessor 26 "will inform the pilot of the distance to the stopping position 53<br>
by displaying it on the display unit 18, 29. By displaying the distance to the stopping position<br>
29, 53 after each scan, the pilot receives constantly updated information in real time about how<br>
far the plane 12 is from stopping.<br>
If the aircraft 12 is in the display area 52, both the lateral 31 and the longitudinal position<br>
29 are provided on the display 18. (126, 128) Once the microprocessor 26 displays the position<br>
of the aircraft 12, the tracking phase ends.<br>
Once it completes the tracking phase, the microprocessor 26 verifies that tracking has not<br>
been lost by checking that the total number of rows flagged divided by the total number of<br>
measured values, or echoes, in the last scan is greater than 0.5. (83) In other words, if more that<br>
50% of the echoes do not correspond to the reference profile, tracking is lost. If tracking is lost<br>
and the aircraft 12 is greater than 12 meters from the stopping point, the system 10 returns to the<br>
capture mode 62. (85) If tracking is lost and the aircraft 12 is less than or equal to 12 meters from<br>
the stopping point 53, the system 10 turns on the stop sign to inform the pilot that it has lost<br>
tracking. (85, 87)<br>
If tracking is not lost, the microprocessor 26 determines if the nose height has been<br>
determined. (13) If the height has not yet been determined, the microprocessor 26 enters the<br>
height measuring phase 86. If the height has already been determined, the microprocessor 26<br>
checks to see if the profile has been determined (402).<br>
In the height measuring phase, illustrated in Fig. 9, the microprocessor 26 determines the<br>
nose height by directing the LRF 20 to scan vertically. The nose height is used by the system<br>
to ensure that the horizontal scans are made across the tip of the nose.<br>
To check the nose height, the microprocessor 26 sets ß to a predetermined value ßmax and<br>
then steps it down in 0.1 degree intervals once per received/reflected pulse until it reaches ßmin,<br>
another predetermined value. ßmax and ßmax are set during installation and typically are -20 and<br>
30 degrees respectively. After ß reaches ßmin the microprocessor 26 directs the step motors, 24,<br>
25 up until it reaches ßmax. That vertical scanning is done with a set to as, the azimuth position<br>
of the previous scan.<br>
Using the measured aircraft distance, the microprocessor 26 selects the column in the<br>
vertical profile table closest to the measured distance. (140) Using the data from the scan and<br>
the data on the vertical profile table, the microprocessor 26 creates a comparison table shown<br>
herein as Table II. Table II is a two dimensional table with the number of the pulse, or angular<br>
step number, as an index 91, i, to the rows. Using that index, the following information,<br>
represented as columns of the table, can be accessed for each row: I, 92, the measured distance<br>
• to the object on that angular step, lsi 93, the measured value compensated for the skew caused by<br>
the displacement (equal to li; minus the quantity Sm, the total displacement during the last scan,<br>
minus the quantity i times sp, the average displacement during each step in the last scan), d1 94,<br>
the distance between the generated profile and the reference profile (equal to rii, the profile value<br>
for the corresponding angle at the profile distance j, minus /ki), a; 95. the distance between the<br>
nose of the aircraft and the measuring equipment equal to rj50, the reference profile value at zero<br>
degrees, minus dj), ac 96, the estimated nose distance after each step (equal to am, the nose<br>
distance at the end of the last scan, minusthe jquantityi,times Sp),ad the.difference: between the<br>
estimated and measured nose distance (equal to the absolute value of a1, minus ae), and Note 97<br>
which indicates echoes that are likely caused by an aircraft 12.<br>
During each scan the microprocessor 26 also generates a Distance Distribution Table<br>
(DDT). That table contains the distribution of ai; values as they appear in Table II. Thus, the<br>
DDT has an entry representing the number of occurrences of each value of ai in Table II in 1<br>
meter increments between 10 to 100 meters.<br>
After every scan, the system 10 uses the DDT to calculate the average distance, am, to the<br>
correct stopping point 53. The microprocessor 26 scans the data in the DDT to find the two<br>
adjacent entries in the DDT for which the sum of their values is the largest. The microprocessor<br>
26 then flags the Note 97 column in Table II for each row containing an entry for a,-<br>
corresponding to either of the two DDT rows having the largest sum. (142)<br>
Once it completes the calculation of the average distance to the correct stopping point 53,<br>
the microprocessor 26 calculates the average displacement during the last scan, sm. The<br>
displacement during the last scan is calculated as:<br>
sm = am-1 - am<br>
where am-1 and am belong to the last two scans. For the first scan in tracking phase 84, sm is set<br>
to 0. The average displacement sp during each step is calculated as:<br>
sp = sm/P<br>
where P is the total number of steps for the last scan cycle.<br>
Calculating the actual nose height is done by adding the nominal nose height,<br>
predetermined height of the expected aircraft when empty, to the vertical or height deviation.<br>
Consequently, to determine the nose height, the system 10 first determines the vertical or height<br>
deviation (144) vertical deviation is calculated by setting;<br>
2d = ßmax - ßmin<br>
where ßmax and ßmin are the highest and lowest ß value for a continuous flagged block of di; values<br>
in the Comparison Table II. Additionally, the microprocessor 26 calculates:<br>
Y1 = 14<br>
for the upper half of the flagged di in the block and;<br>
for the lower half of the block. Using Y, and Y2 , "a" is calculated as<br>
a = k x (Y, - Y,)/d2<br>
where k is given in the reference profile. If "a" exceeds a given value, preferably one, it is<br>
assumed that there is a vertical deviation approximately equal to "a". The 1; column is then<br>
shifted "a" steps, the Comparison Table II is re-screened and "a" recalculated. That process<br>
continues until "a" is smaller than the given value, preferably one. The total shift, ßss of the li<br>
column is considered equal to the height deviation. (144) The ßi values in the vertical<br>
Comparison Table II are then adjusted as ßj + ?ßj where the height deviation ?ßj is:<br>
?ßj = ßsx(aniß + as)/(aj + as)<br>
and where amß is the valid am value when ßs was calculated.<br>
Once the height deviation is determined, the microprocessor 26 checks if it is bigger than<br>
a predetermined value, preferably one. (146) If the deviation is larger than that value, the<br>
microprocessor 26 adjusts the profile vertically corresponding to that offset. (148) The<br>
microprocessor 26 stores the vertical adjustment as the deviation from the nominal nose height.<br>
(150) The actual height of the aircraft is the nominal nose height plus the deviation.<br>
If the nose height is determined, or once the height measuring phase 86 is run, the<br>
microprocessor 26 enters the identification phase illustrated in Fig. 10. (133, 88) In the:<br>
identification phase 88, the microprocessor 26 creates a Comparison Table II to reflect the results<br>
of another vertical scan and the contents of the profile table. (152, 154). Another vertical scan<br>
is performed in the identification phase 88 because the previous scan may have provided<br>
sufficient data for height determination but not enough for identification. In fact, several scans<br>
may need to be done before a positive identification can be made. After calculating the vertical<br>
offset 156, checking that it is not too large (158) and adjusting the profile vertically<br>
corresponding to the offset (160) until the offset drops below a given amount, preferably one, the<br>
microprocessor 26 calculates the average distance between marked echoes and the profile and<br>
the mean distance between the marked echoes and that average distance. (162)<br>
The average distance dm between the measured and corrected profile and the deviation<br>
T from that average distance are calculated after vertical and horizontal scans as follows:<br>
dm = Idi/N<br>
T-Sldi- dm|/N<br>
If T is less than a given value, preferably 5, for both profiles, the aircraft 12 is judged to be of the<br>
correct type provided that a sufficient number of echoes are received. (164) Whether a sufficient<br>
number of echoes is received is based on;<br>
N/size &gt; 0.75<br>
where N is the number of "accepted" echoes and "size" is the maximum number of value:,<br>
possible. If the aircraft 12 is not of the correct type, the microprocessor turns on the stop sign<br>
136 and suspends the docking mode 400.<br>
If the profile is determined (402), or once the profile determination phase is run (404),<br>
the microprocessor 26 determines whether the aircraft criterion is determined (406). If not, the<br>
aircraft criterion phase 408, which is illustrated in figs.l 1 and 12, is run.<br>
In order for the criterion to be fulfilled, echoes must be returned from the location where<br>
there is an engine on the expected aircraft. As there is some measurement uncertainty, there<br>
might be echoes that actually come from the engine but appear to come from outside the engine.<br>
Therefore, there must be defined a space Vi, called the inner volume or the active volume, around<br>
the engine, such that echoes from within Vi are considered to come from the engine. Fig. 12<br>
shows a sample Vi around an engine 13 of an airplane 12.<br>
An engine is characterized in that for a horizontal scan there is a reflecting surface<br>
surrounded by free space. In order to be able to discriminate between an engine and, e.g., a wing,<br>
there must be defined another space Vo around the engine where there must be no or very few<br>
echoes. The space Vo is called the outer volume or the passive volume. Fig. 12 also shows a<br>
sample Vo around Vi.<br>
The engine is defined by its coordinates (dx, dy, dz) for the center of the engine front<br>
relative to the nose and by its diameter D. Those parameters are stored in a database for all<br>
aircraft types.<br>
Vi and Vo are defined by the extension sideways (x-direction) and lengthwise (z-<br>
direction) from that engine center. The vertical position of the engine is given as (nose height +<br>
dy).<br>
For an engine on the wing, Vi and Vo are defined, by the following ranges of coordinates:<br>
Vi:<br>
x-direction: ±(D/2 + 1 m)<br>
z-direction: + 3 m, - 1 m<br>
Vo:<br>
x-direction: ±2 m from Vi<br>
z-direction: ±1.5 m from Vi<br>
For tail engines the definition is the same except for Vo in the x-direction, which is given<br>
by + 2 m from Vi. Otherwise echoes from the fuselage could fall within Vo and the<br>
criterion would not be fulfilled.<br>
Finally, the criterion is<br>
Vi/(Vi + Vo) &gt; 0.7<br>
The threshold value 0.7 in the criterion is determined empirically. So are the limits given above<br>
for Vi and Vo. At the moment those values are chosen so that unnecessary ID failures are<br>
avoided and they are different only dependent on if the engine is on the wing or on the tail. As<br>
docking data is accumulated they will be adjusted, probably different for different aircraft types,<br>
to achieve better and better discrimination.<br>
The aircraft criteria phase 408 applies the above principles as shown in the flow chart of<br>
Fig. 11. When the aircraft criteria phase starts, the LRF is directed toward the engine or other<br>
selected aircraft criterion in step 1102. In step 1104, the number of echoes in Vi is found, and<br>
in step 1106, the number of echoes in Vo is found. In step 1108, it is determined whether<br>
Vi/(Vi+Vo) exceeds the threshold value. If so, the aircraft criterion is indicated as met (OK) in<br>
step 1110. Otherwise, the aircraft criterion is indicated as unmet (not OK) in step 1112.<br>
If the aircraft criterion has been determined (406), or once the aircraft criterion phase is<br>
complete (408), the microprocessor 26 determines whether the aircraft 12 has been identified.<br>
(410). If the aircraft 12 has been identified, the microprocessor 26 checks whether the aircraft<br>
12 has reached the stop position. (412). If the stop position is reached, the microprocessor 26<br>
turns on the stop sign, whereupon the system 10 has completed the docking mode 400. (414)<br>
If the aircraft 12 has not reached the stop position, the microprocessor 26 returns to the tracking<br>
phase 84.<br>
If the aircraft 12 is not identified, the microprocessor 26 checks whether the aircraft 12<br>
is less than or equal to 12 meters from the stopping position 53. (416) If the aircraft 12 is not<br>
more than 12 meters from the stopping position 53, the system 10 turns on the stop sign to<br>
inform the pilot that the identification has failed. (418) After displaying the stop sign, the<br>
system 10 shuts down.<br>
If the aircraft 12 is more than 12 meters from the stopping point 53, the microprocessor<br>
26 returns to the tracking phase 84.<br>
In one possible implementation, the nominal distance (longitudinal and lateral) from the<br>
nose to the engine is used as the aircraft criterion. In that implementation, docking is stopped<br>
if the nose-to-engine distance, as measured in step 408, is more than two meters shorter than that<br>
for the expected aircraft. If the difference is within two meters, it may still be possible to accept<br>
an aircraft of the wrong type safely. In the latter case, if the safety margin between the engine<br>
and a structure of the airport gate is three meters for the correct type of aircraft, the safety margin<br>
for the other type of aircraft is still at least one meter. Tests have shown that the engine position<br>
can be located to within about ± 1 meter and that the nose height can be determined to within ±<br>
0.5 meter.<br>
Fig. 13 shows the nominal nose to engine distance of an aircraft 12. The distance from<br>
the aircraft"s nose to its engine 13 is of particular concern, since the engine 13 is in such a<br>
position that misidentification can result in a collision between the engine 13 and a component<br>
of the gate. Also shown are forward and backward tolerance limits for the position of the engine<br>
13 that define the forward and backward extentS of Vi.<br>
Fig. 34 shows an application of the identification procedure described above and in<br>
particular shows what may happen if the system is set up for a selected aircraft 12A, but another<br>
aircraft 12B attempts to dock at that gate. If a type of aircraft 12B different from the selected<br>
aircraft 12A is accepted into the gate, the aircraft 12B will be stopped with the nose in the same<br>
position in which the nose of the selected aircraft 12A would be stopped. As a result, the safety<br>
margin, which is the distance from the engine to the closest component of the gate, such as the<br>
bridge 15. is different between the aircraft 12A and 12B if the nose-to-engine distances of those<br>
aircraft are different. As can be seen from Fig. 14, the safety margin for the aircraft 12B is equal<br>
to the safety margin for the aircraft 12A minus the difference in nose-to-engine distances. If, for<br>
example, the safety margin for the aircraft 12A is 3 m, and the nose-to-engine distance for the<br>
aircraft 12B is 3.5m shorter than that for the aircraft 12A, the engine 13B of the aircraft 12B will<br>
collide with the bridge 15. Therefore, if all aircraft types for which the nose-to-engine distance<br>
is too small in comparison with that for the selected aircraft 12A are stopped, i.e., not accepted<br>
into the gate, the safety margin can always be kept at an acceptable level.<br>
A situation in which the aircraft is at an angle relative to the DGS 10 will now be<br>
considered. As shown in Fig. 15A, a first aircraft 12D can be aligned correctly relative to the<br>
DGS 10, whereas a second aircraft 12D can deviate from the correct alignment by a yaw angle<br>
Y- A very high-level description of the technique used in such a situation is that the yaw angle<br>
of the aircraft is determined, and the profile is rotated to match that yaw angle.<br>
Fig. 15 shows a flow chart of the technique. In step 1502, the polar coordinates of the<br>
echoes returned from the aircraft are converted to Cartesian coordinates. In step 1504, the yaw<br>
angle is calculated. In step 1506, the echo profile is rotated. In step 1508, the ID characteristics<br>
are detected in the manner already described.<br>
Step 1502 is carried out in the following manner. The echo coordinates received from<br>
the aircraft are converted from polar coordinates (afrf) to Cartesian coordinates (Xj,yj) with the<br>
origin in the nose tip (anosernose) and with the y-axis along the line from the laser unit through the<br>
nose tip as follows:<br>
Xj - rj sinaj<br>
yj = Tj COSa.J - rnose.<br>
Step 1504 is carried out in a manner which will be explained with reference to Figs. 16<br>
and 17. Fig. 16 is a diagram showing the geometry of the regression lines on either side of the<br>
nose tip. Fig. 17 is a flow chart showing steps in the algorithm.<br>
The algorithm is based on regression lines, calculated for echoes in a defined region<br>
behind the nose tip. If there are a sufficient number of echoes on both sides of the nose, then the<br>
yaw angle is calculated from the difference in angle between the regression lines. If only the<br>
regression line for one side of the nose can be calculated, e.g. due to the yaw angle, then the yaw<br>
angle is calculated from the difference in angle between that regression line and the<br>
corresponding part of the reference profile.<br>
In step 1702, the echo coordinates are converted to Cartesian coordinates (xfyj) in the<br>
manner described above. In step 1704, the approximate coordinates of the nose tip are<br>
calculated.<br>
In step 1706, the echoes are screened in the following manner. Echoes not representative<br>
for the general shape of the echo picture are removed before the angle of the echo picture is<br>
calculated. The echo screening starts from the origin (the pointed out nose tip) and removes<br>
both echoes if an echo at next higher angular step is at the same or shorter distance.<br>
In step 1708, for each echo, the distance Rm tothe nose tip is calculated as<br>
In step 1710, for each side of the nose tip, the echoes are selected for which R are larger<br>
than Rmm, which is a constant (in the order of 1 - 2 m) defined specifically for each aircraft type.<br>
In step 1712, the following mean values are calculated:<br>
where n = the number of echoes &gt; Rmin on a respective side, and the subscript right or left<br>
identifies the respective side to which a particular quantity applies.<br>
In step 1712, each regression line"s angle vreg to they axis is calculated as:<br>
The subscript mean should be read as leftmean or rightmean in accordance with whether the<br>
angle is calculated on the left or right side of the nose.<br>
The. yaw angle y is calculated in the following manner. In step 1714, it is determined<br>
whether the number n of echoes on both sides of the nose is greater than a predetermined value<br>
TV, e.g., 5. If so, then in step 1718, y is calculated as<br>
Y = (yreglefi+yreglefi)/2,<br>
where yreglefi, and vregrighl are the angles calculated for the left and right sides of the nose using the<br>
procedure of step 1712. On the other hand, if the n 
profile is used for the calculation. In step 1720, the side and segment of the profile are identified<br>
which correspond to the side where n&gt;N In step 1722, the angle yreglefi is calculated for that<br>
segment using the procedure of step 1712. Then y is calculated in step 1718 as y = (yreglefi - vreg).<br>
Once the yaw angle is calculated, then, in step 1506, the echo profile is rotated<br>
accordingly. More specifically, the echo profile is converted from one Cartesian coordinate<br>
system (x,y) to another (w,v) which has the same origin but is rotated by an angle equal to the yaw<br>
angle y, as shown in Fig. 18. The rotation of the echo profile will now be described with<br>
reference to Figs. 18 and 19.<br>
In step 1902, the approximate coordinates of the nose tip are calculated. In step 1904,<br>
the echo coordinates are converted from polar to Cartesian coordinates (xp yi) with the nose tip<br>
as the origin of the coordinate system. The technique for doing so has been described above.<br>
In step 1906, the echo coordinates are converted from the (x,y) coordinate system to the (w,v)<br>
coordinate system, as shown in Fig. 18, through the following formulae:<br>
ui, = xi, cos y + yt sin y;<br>
vi, — -Xj sin y +yi cos y.<br>
The echo coordinates as thus rotated are used to identify the aircraft in the manner<br>
described above.<br>
It will now be described how to set parameters defining center lines (CL"s), curved as<br>
well as straight, with reference to Figs. 20-22. One docking system can handle several center .<br>
lines with the technique to be described.<br>
The CL is specified as a piecewise linear curve, where a,/ are coordinates (a — sideways,<br>
/-lengthways) for the breaking points and are used as the defining parameters. The number of<br>
coordinates used is chosen with respect to required positioning accuracy. A straight CL is thus<br>
defined by the coordinates of two points (e.g. at the clip distance and at a stop position). The<br>
number of coordinates required for a curved CL depends on its radius.<br>
The microprocessor 26 is used in the CL setting mode of step 2002. in which the CI."s<br>
arc mapped in the microprocessor. A CL to be defined is selected from a menu. One or more<br>
calibration poles with known height and a top which is easily recognised in the calibration<br>
picture arc placed on different positions on that CL. For each pole, the height of the pole is typed<br>
in, and the top of the pole as appearing in the calibration picture is clicked. The a and /<br>
coordinates for the pole are automatically entered in the table for that CL. The procedure is<br>
repeated for each pole. The coordinates for the various poles arc ordered in the table by their /<br>
values. The number of poles needed depends on the type of CL, with a straight CL needing only<br>
two and a curved CL needing more.<br>
The calculation of the offset of the nose from the nose wheel will now be discussed. The<br>
CL is normally given as the ideal nosc-wheel track, but the guidance given to the aircraft is<br>
normally based on the nose position. That means, in case of a curved CL, that either the CL<br>
coordinates must be converted to nose-coordinates, or the nose position must be converted to<br>
nose-wheel position. The latter is chosen, which means that the yaw angle (v,,u) of the aircraft is<br>
determined in step 2004 in the manner described above.<br>
The nosc-wheel position (awlv) is calculated in step 2006 as follows:<br>
a- • a. + /„„ x sin vnu AL ? Lnw x cos O (in rad.)<br>
l - 1n + lnw~ x cos vNN<br>
where<br>
an /m: measured position of the nose;<br>
lnw: nosc-wheel distance; and<br>
vrvi: estimated yaw angle of aircraft.<br>
The offset of the no.se wheel from the CL is calculated in step 2008 as follows:<br>
Offset = a, - a,r +¦ (/„ - /,)(aal,a)""(/../ - /.)<br>
where<br>
a, /, is the CL-coordinatc pair with /.-value just below /,,; and<br>
a.,.,, I,., is the ("I.-coordinate pair with /,-value just above /„.<br>
The calculations of step 2006 will now be explained with reference to Fig. 21, in which:<br>
/„„: nosc-wheel distance<br>
v: estimated yaw angle of aircraft<br>
x: estimated sideways position of nose-wheel<br>
a,.w an, + x/(/n +lnw /nw x cos v) (in rad.)<br>
lwn /n + /nw x cos v<br>
x — lmm x sin v<br>
The calculations of step 2008 will now be explained with reference to Fig. 22, in which<br>
Xo/y0 represents the estimated position of the nose wheel and xj y, represents the breaking points<br>
in the picccwisc-lincar model of a curved CL. The "real" offset from the CL is the distance<br>
measured in a rip.ht angle to the CL. An approximation of that distance is the distance measured<br>
in a right angle to the laser beam from the docking system. That distance corresponds to the<br>
value (xm - x0) in Fig. 22. As the absolute value of the offset not is important, that approximation<br>
is used. From Fig. 22, it follows that<br>
Offset - (xm - x0) = x1, - x0 + (y0 - y,)(x,,, -x,)/(y,., - y,).<br>
While a preferred embodiment of the present invention has been set forth in detail above,<br>
those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that other embodiments can be realized within the<br>
scope of the invention. For example, while the aircraft criterion phase 408 is disclosed as using<br>
the ratio Vi/(Vi +-Vo). the difference Vi-Vo could be used instead. Also, the specific numerical<br>
ranges disclosed above should be considered to be illustrative rather than limiting. Those skilled<br>
in the art will be able to derive other numerical ranges as needed to adapt the invention to other<br>
models ofaircraft or to the .specific needs of various airports. Furthermore, while regression lines<br>
are a useful technique for determining the yaw angle, any other technique can be used.<br>
Therefore, the present invention should be construed as limited only by the appended claims.<br>
