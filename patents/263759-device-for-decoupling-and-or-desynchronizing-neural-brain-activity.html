The invention relates to a device for decoupling and/or<br>
desynchronizing neural brain activity, as claimed in<br>
the preamble of claim 1.<br>
A pathologically synchronous brain activity which can<br>
have its origin, for example, in the basal ganglia-, can<br>
also produce a synchronization in the following areas<br>
such as, for example, the motor cortex, as a driving<br>
force. This secondary synchronization is significantly<br>
involved in generating the pathological symptoms. The<br>
invention relates to a device which allows the driving<br>
pathological activity to be decoupled from the<br>
following areas by which means a great reduction in the<br>
pathological symptoms can be effected. In a further<br>
embodiment, the device according to the invention can<br>
also be used for desynchronizing, i.e. for suppressing<br>
a rhythmic collective activity or, respectively,<br>
collective firing of the neurons of the pathologically<br>
synchronous nerve cell populations, which are called<br>
driving populations.<br>
In patients with neurological or psychiatric diseases,<br>
e.g. Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, dystonia or<br>
compulsive diseases, nerve cell populations are<br>
pathologically active, e.g. excessively synchronous, in<br>
defined areas of the brain, e.g. the thalamus and the<br>
basal ganglia. In this case, a large number of neurons<br>
form synchronous action potentials; the neurons<br>
involved are firing excessively synchronously. In the<br>
healthy person,<br><br>
in contrast, the neurons are firing qualitatively<br>
differently in these brain regions, e.g. in an<br>
uncorrelated manner. The pathologically synchronous<br>
brain activity changes the neural activity in other<br>
brain regions, e.g. in areas of the cerebral cortex<br>
such as the primary motor cortex. The pathologically<br>
synchronous activity then forces its rhythm onto the<br>
cerebral cortex areas in the area of the thalamus and<br>
of the basal ganglia so that, finally, the muscles<br>
controlled by these areas develop pathological<br>
activity, e.g. a rhythmic trembling (tremor).<br>
In patients who can no longer be treated by medicaments,<br>
a depth electrode is implemented unilaterally or<br>
bilaterally depending on the symptoms and on whether the<br>
disease occurs unilaterally or bilaterally. In this<br>
arrangement, a cable leads under the skin from the head<br>
to the so-called generator which comprises a control<br>
device with a battery and is implanted underneath the<br>
skin, for example in the area of the clavicle. A<br>
continuous stimulation with a high-frequency periodic<br>
sequence (pulse train with a frequency of &gt; 100 Hz) of<br>
single pulses, e.g. rectangular pulses, is carried out<br>
via the depth electrodes. This method has the aim of<br>
suppressing the firing of the' neurons in the target<br>
areas. The effective mechanism on which the standard<br>
depth stimulation is based has not yet been explained<br>
sufficiently. The results of a number of studies<br>
indicate that the standard depth stimulation acts like a<br>
reversible lesion, i.e. like a reversible elimination of<br>
the tissue. The standard depth stimulation suppresses<br>
the firing of the neurons in the target regions and/or<br>
the associated brain areas.<br><br>
The disadvantageous feature of this form of stimulation<br>
is that the energy consumption of the generator is very-<br>
high so that the. generator and its battery must<br>
frequently be operatively replaced after only<br>
approximately one to three years. It is even more<br>
disadvantageous that the continuous high-frequency<br>
stimulation, as an. unphysiological (unnatural) input in<br>
the area of the brain, e.g. the thalamus or the. basal<br>
ganglia, respectively, can lead to an adaptation of the<br>
nerve cell populations affected in the course of a few<br>
years. To achieve the same stimulation result, it is<br>
then necessary to stimulate with a higher stimulus<br>
amplitude due to this adaptation. The greater the<br>
stimulus amplitude, the greater the possibility that<br>
side effects occur due to the stimulation of<br>
neighboring areas - such as dysarthria (speech<br>
disturbances), disesthesia (in some cases very painful<br>
abnormal sensations), cerebellar ataxia (inability to<br>
stand securely without aid) or schizophrenic symptoms<br>
etc. These side effects cannot be tolerated by the<br>
patient. In these cases, the treatment, therefore,<br>
loses its effectiveness after a few years.<br>
In other stimulation methods as described, for example,<br>
in DE 102 11 766 Al, it is proposed that stimuli are<br>
applied in the respective target region controlled by<br>
requirement. It is the aim of these methods and these<br>
devices, to not simply suppress the pathologically<br>
synchronous firing as in the case of the standard depth<br>
stimulation but to bring it closer to the physiological<br>
uncorrelated firing pattern. By this means, the current<br>
consumption is to be reduced, on the one hand, and, on<br>
the other hand, the energy input into the tissue is to<br>
be reduced by the demand-controlled stimulation in<br>
comparison with the standard depth stimulation.<br>
The abovementioned stimulation methods require the use<br>
of one or more depth electrodes which represents a high<br>
operative effort and a high risk of complications such<br><br>
as, e.g. possible brain tissue damage or brain bleeding<br>
during the implantation of the depth electrodes<br><br>
for the patient. However, this risk should be reduced<br>
with a view to successfully healing the patient and<br>
reducing side effects.<br>
It is an object of the invention, therefore to create a<br>
device for decoupling and/or desynchronizing neural<br>
brain activity by means of which patients with<br>
pathologically synchronized brain activity can be<br>
treated mildly and efficiently. In this context, an<br>
adaptation to an unphysiological permanent stimulus<br>
should be prevented. Longwinded calibration processes<br>
should be prevented and the stimulation should also be<br>
successful when the main frequency component of the<br>
pathologically rhythmic activity is subject to great<br>
fluctuations. Furthermore, the device should achieve<br>
permanent decoupling and/or desynchronization, and<br>
transient stimulation-related unphysiological states<br>
should be largely avoided. The device according to the<br>
invention does not require additional demand control<br>
which, as described in section 6.3, can be optionally<br>
added, which is why it is technically easily<br>
implemented and only low demands are made on the<br>
complexity of the control electronics and thus also<br><br>
1.	It requires a time-consuming calibration procedure<br>
which is typically longer than 30 minutes.<br>
2.	Due to the time-consuming calibration procedure, the<br>
effect of the desynchronizing stimulation, according<br>
to DE 102 11 766.7, cannot be utilized for the<br>
intraoperative selection of the most suitable target<br>
point for the depth electrode. To achieve this, the<br>
effect of the desynchronizing stimulation according<br>
to DE 102 11 766.7 would have to be tested<br>
separately for different target points which would<br>
require separate calibration for each target point;<br>
this would prolong the duration of an electrode<br>
implantation unreasonably for the patient.<br>
3.	When great fluctuations occur in the network<br>
characteristics, i.e. fluctuations in the parameters<br>
which describe the activity of the nerve cell<br>
population such as, e.g. synaptic intensities and<br>
firing weights, recalibration is necessary. It is<br>
then disadvantageous that no therapeutic effect can<br>
be achieved during the calibration.<br>
4.	Since the desynchronizing stimulation according to<br>
DE 102 11 766.7 only has an effect if the frequency<br>
of the neuron population to be desynchronized is not<br>
subject to great fluctuations, it cannot be applied<br>
in diseases with short-term periods of<br>
pathologically excessive synchronous activity with<br>
greatly varying frequency, for example in the case<br>
of epilepsy.<br>
Disadvantages of the demand-controlled desynchronizing<br>
stimulation methods according to DE 103 18 071.0-33<br>
result from the following fact: to desynchronize a<br>
synchronized nerve cell population by means of an<br>
electric stimulus,<br><br>
multielectrode stimulation is performed. A . high-<br>
frequency pulse train or a low-frequency pulse train of<br>
short duration is applied to the individual electrodes.<br>
This leads to a phase resetting of the stimulated<br>
neuron population. The times at which stimulation is<br>
applied via the different electrodes are selected in<br>
such a manner that an equidistant phase shift is<br>
produced between the neural subpopulations associated<br>
with the stimulation electrodes. After such a stimulus<br>
imparted over a number of electrodes has ended, a<br>
complete desynchronization occurs automatically due to<br>
the pathologically increased interaction between the<br>
neurons.<br>
This method has the advantage of fast calibration and<br>
ruggedness with respect to fluctuations of the<br>
parameters and this stimulation method can thus also be<br>
used in cases in which only brief periods of<br>
synchronous activity with greatly varying frequency<br>
occur. Nevertheless, method DE 103 18 071.0-33 also has<br>
great disadvantages:<br>
1. The essential factor in the method filed in<br>
DE 103 18 071.0-33 is the repeated and possibly<br>
demand-controlled application of a total stimulus.<br>
The stimulated tissue resynchronizes between the<br>
total stimuli. This leads to the nerve population to<br>
be desynchronized alternating between two<br>
unphysiological states: an N-cluster state, where N<br>
represents the number of electrodes to be used for<br>
the stimulation, and a transient state of<br>
resynchronization. The population to be<br>
desynchronized is thus never in the desired state of<br>
desynchronization for any length of time<br><br>
but this has to be the aim in order to reduce the<br>
disease-related symptoms and the stimulation-related<br>
side effects.<br>
2. The demand control filed in DE 103 18 071.0-33 needs<br>
a complex control system which has complicated<br>
control electronics and, of necessity, higher energy<br>
consumption.<br>
The abovementioned. stimulation methods use single<br>
pulses, high-frequency and low-frequency pulse trains<br>
as stimulation signals which modulate the dynamics -<br>
particularly the phase dynamics - of the stimulated<br>
neurons, e.g. bring the neuron population to be<br>
desynchronized into an N-cluster state by means of a<br>
phase reset. The stimulation pulse trains are<br>
constructed without using the inherent dynamics of the<br>
neuron population to be desynchronized and, in this<br>
sense, are foreign and unphysiological signals for the<br>
neuron population to be -desynchronized. To suppress the<br>
pathological symptomatic, the stimulus pulse trains<br>
must be applied with high intensity which leads to the<br>
adaptation of the neuron population to be<br>
desynchronized to the unphysiological stimuli and<br>
possible side effects to be effected.<br>
The method described in DE 103 18 071.0 "Device for<br>
treating patients by time-delayed multielectrode<br>
stimulation of the brain" also has disadvantages:<br>
1. At least two electrodes must be used for the<br>
stimulation.<br><br>
2. The electrodes mus.t be constructed essentially as<br>
depth electrodes which results in a higher risk,<br>
e.g. of brain tissue damage during the implantation<br>
of the depth electrodes for the patient.<br>
The abovementioned stimulation methods require the use<br>
of one or more depth electrodes which represents a high<br>
operative effort and a high risk of complications such<br>
as, e.g. possible brain tissue damage or brain bleeding<br>
during the implantation of .the depth electrodes for the<br>
patient. However, this risk should be reduced with a<br>
view to successfully healing the patient and reducing<br>
side effects.<br>
It is an object of the invention, therefore to create a<br>
device for decoupling and/or desynchronizing neural<br>
brain activity by means of which patients with<br>
pathologically synchronized brain activity can be<br>
treated mildly and efficiently. In this context,, an<br>
adaptation to an unphysiological permanent stimulus<br>
should be prevented. Longwinded calibration processes<br>
should be prevented and the stimulation should also be<br>
successful when the main frequency component of the<br>
pathologically rhythmic activity is subject to great<br>
fluctuations. Furthermore, the device should achieve<br>
permanent decoupling and/or desynchronization, and<br>
transient stimulation-related unphysiological states<br>
should be largely avoided. The device according to the<br>
invention does not require additional demand control<br>
which, as described in section 6.3, can be optionally<br>
added, which is why it is technically easily<br>
implemented and only low demands are made on the<br>
complexity of the control electronics and thus also<br><br>
on the current consumption. The stimulation device<br>
according to the invention is intended to operate in a<br>
current-saving manner so that the batteries of the<br>
stimulator implanted in a patient need to be replaced<br>
operatively less frequently. Since an implantation of<br>
preferably only one electrode is necessary and since<br>
this electrode is implanted in a following and thus<br>
possibly more easily accessible brain area such as,<br>
e.g. an epicortical electrode in the area of the motor<br>
cortex, the device according to the invention<br>
represents a considerable improvement in comparison<br>
with the abovementioned methods of depth brain<br>
stimulation. This is because the brain stimulation does<br>
not require a depth electrode - particularly in a<br><br>
particular embodiment of the device according to the<br>
invention, so that there is no risk of intraoperative<br>
bleeding due to an injury to an artery.<br>
On the basis of the preamble of claim 1, the object is<br>
achieved, according to the invention, by the features<br>
specified in the characterizing clause of claim 1. By<br>
using the measured and processed activity of the neuron<br>
population to be decoupled and/or to be desynchronized<br>
as a feedback stimulation signal, see section 3, the<br>
object is surprisingly achieved in that the neurons are<br>
in each case influenced in their activity by the<br>
stimulation with the feedback stimulation signal by<br>
means of an electrode, in such a manner that a complete<br>
decoupling and/or desynchronization of the neutron<br>
population to be decoupled from the driving<br>
pathological neuron population occurs surprisingly as a<br>
result of" which the symptoms are surprisingly<br>
suppressed in a patient. In a further embodiment of the<br>
device according to the invention as described in<br>
section 8, the device can also be used, for example,<br>
for desynchronizing the driving neuron population. In<br>
this embodiment, the measured and processed neural<br>
activity of the driving neuron population is applied as<br>
feedback stimulation signal via the stimulation<br>
electrode so that a direct or indirect stimulation of<br>
the driving neuron population with the feedback<br>
stimulation signal occurs. By this means, the neuron<br>
population to be desynchronized is influenced in such a<br>
manner that a complete desynchronization occurs<br>
surprisingly, as a result of which the disease-related<br>
symptoms are suppressed. For this purpose, the device<br>
according to the invention comprises a control system 4<br>
which receives the measurement signal of the sensors 3<br>
or of the sensors 3 and generates from this signal a<br>
^ stimulation signal<br><br>
and applies it to the electrode 2 as stimulation<br>
stimulus.<br>
The device according to the invention operates in a<br>
current-saving manner so that batteries implanted in<br>
the patient need to be replaced less frequently.<br>
The device according to the invention enables the<br>
effect achieved intraoperatively by means of the<br>
decoupling stimulation to be used for selecting the<br>
most suitable target point for the electrode. When<br>
using a depth brain electrode as electrode 2, a test<br>
stimulus and/or derivation of the feedback signal is<br>
first carried out in mm steps with the device according<br>
to the invention in the area. of the anatomically<br>
precalculated target point during the implantation of<br>
the electrode. The target point at which the best<br>
therapeutic effect can be achieved is selected as<br>
target point for the permanent implantation.<br>
Apart from the abovementioned diseases which exhibit<br>
frequently persistent pathologically synchronous<br>
activity with relatively constant frequency, diseases<br>
can also be treated in which pathologically synchronous<br>
activity only occurs intermittently (occurring for<br>
short times) . A main indication is the treatment of<br>
epilepsies which can no longer be treated by<br>
medicaments. The device according to the invention can<br>
effect a suppression of the symptoms, for example, in<br>
the illnesses Parkinson's disease, essential tremor,<br>
dystonia, epilepsy, depression and compulsive diseases.<br>

The device according to figure 1 comprises an isolating<br>
amplifier 1 which is connected to an electrode 2 and at<br>
least one sensor 3 for detecting physiological<br>
measurement signals. The electrode 2 used can be, for<br>
example, an epicortical electrode or brain electrode.<br>
The isolating amplifier is also connected to a unit 4<br>
for signal processing and control which is connected to<br>
an optical transmitter for the stimulation 5. The<br>
optical transmitter 5 is connected via optical<br>
waveguides 6 to an optical receiver 7 which is<br>
connected to a stimulator unit 8 for signal generation.<br>
The stimulator unit 8 for signal generation is<br>
connected to an electrode 2. At the input area of the<br>
electrode 2 into the isolating amplifier 1, a relay 9<br>
or transistor is located. The unit 4 is connected via a<br>
line 10 to a telemetry transmitter 11 which is<br>
connected to a telemetry receiver 12 which is located<br>
outside the device to be implanted and to which a means<br>
for displaying, processing and storing the data 13 is<br>
connected. The sensors 3 used can be, for example,<br>
epicortical electrodes, brain electrodes or peripheral<br>
electrodes.<br>
The electrode 2 can be any electrode which is known to<br>
the expert and which is suitable for the<br><br>
application according to the invention. In the wider<br>
sense of the invention, an electrode, therefore, is an<br>
object which can apply the stimuli according to the<br>
invention.<br>
The electrode 2 is, for example, at least two wires to<br>
the ends of which a potential difference is applied for<br>
the purpose of stimulation. It can be a macro or a<br>
microelectrode. As an alternative, the electrode 2 can<br>
also be a single wire. In this case, a potential<br>
difference is applied between a single wire and the<br>
metallic part of the housing of the generator for the<br>
purpose of stimulation. Additionally, but not<br>
mandatorily, a potential difference can be measured via<br>
the electrode 2 in order to register neural activity.<br>
In a further embodiment, the electrode 2 can also<br>
consist of more than two single wires which can be used<br>
both for determining a measurement signal in the brain<br>
and for the stimulation.<br>
In the case where the electrode 2 comprises more than<br>
two wires, at least one of these wires can also act as<br>
sensor 3 so that in this case, an embodiment is present<br>
in which in the electrode 2 and the sensor 3 are<br>
combined in a single component. The wires of the<br>
electrode 2 can have different lengths so that they can<br>
penetrate into different brain depths. If the electrode<br>
2 consists of n wires, where n is an integral number of<br>
greater than 2, stimulation can be effected via at<br>
least one pair of wires, any subcombination of wires<br>
being possible in forming the pair. A stimulation can<br>
also be performed between one of the n wires and the<br>
metallic part of the housing of the generator. Apart<br>
from this component, sensors 3 not -constructionally<br>
combined with the electrode 2 can also be additionally<br>
present.<br><br>
By way of example and illustratively, the neural<br>
activity is measured by the device according to the<br>
invention in a first step by means of the sensors. In a<br>
second step, the stimulation signal is generated by a<br>
further processing of the measured signal, e.g. by<br>
delaying the neural activity in time and possibly by<br>
filtering and/or amplifying it. The stimulation<br>
stimulus generated from this stimulation signal is then<br>
used for stimulation in a third operating step via an<br>
implanted electrode. As a consequence of this<br>
stimulation, decoupling and/or desynchronization of the<br>
pathological activity occurs in the stimulated tissue.<br>
Details of the operation of the device according to the<br>
invention are explained in section 1.<br>
As described in section 6, the device according to the<br>
invention can be implemented in various embodiments of<br>
the temporal control of the stimulus application. The<br>
variants of the temporal control of stimulus<br>
application are permanent, repetitive and demand-<br>
controlled stimulus application.<br>
The permanent stimulus application according to the<br>
invention is a simple embodiment of the device<br>
according to the invention which operates without<br>
additional demand control and applies stimuli<br>
permanently as described in section 6.1. The permanent<br>
stimulus application thus represents an easily<br>
implemented embodiment of the device according to the<br>
invention. At the same time, a good decoupling and/or<br>
desynchronizing effect' of the permanent stimulation<br>
occurs due to the self-regulating demand control<br>
according to the invention, described in section 5,<br>
with little energy input into the population to be<br>
decoupled or the population to be.desynchronized.<br><br>
In the repetitive stimulus application according to the<br>
invention, the device according to the invention has a<br>
control system which is programmed in such a manner<br>
that it applies the stimulation stimulus to the<br>
electrode 2 only during particular time intervals.<br>
There is no stimulation outside these time intervals.<br>
The control unit 4 is programmed in such a manner,<br>
therefore, that, in the embodiment of the repetitive<br>
stimulation described in section 6.2, a stimulation<br>
signal is generated with a duration calculated by the<br>
control unit 4 at times determined by the control unit<br>
4, for example following one another periodically, and<br>
is delivered to the electrode 2. As in the case of<br>
permanent stimulus application, the self-regulating<br>
demand control of the stimulation signal according to<br>
section 5 also occurs in the repetitive stimulus<br>
application.<br>
In the demand-controlled stimulus application according<br>
to the invention, the device according to the invention<br>
has an additional demand control as described in<br>
section 6.3. For this purpose, the device according to<br>
the invention is preferably equipped with means for<br>
detecting the occurrence and/or the instance of the<br>
pathological features in the signals of the electrode 2<br>
and/or in the sensors 3 and/or in the neural activity<br>
processed. Depending on the occurrence and the instance<br>
of pathological features, a stimulus signal is<br>
delivered to the electrode . 2 in the embodiment of the<br>
demand-controlled stimulus application described in<br>
section 6.3 so that a stimulation of the brain tissue<br>
is effected. By this means, the pathological neural<br>
activity in the neuron population is decoupled and/or<br>
desynchronized and thus brought closer to the natural<br>
physiological state. The, pathological activity differs<br>
from the healthy activity by a characteristic change in<br>
its pattern and/or<br><br>
its amplitude and/or its frequency content and/or in<br>
its variation with time. The means for detecting the<br>
pathological pattern are a computer which processes the<br>
measured signals of the electrode 2 and/or of the<br>
sensor 3 and compares them with data stored in the<br>
computer. The computer has a data medium which stores<br>
data. These can be used as part of the calibration<br>
and/or control according to sections 6 and 7. The<br>
control unit 4 can comprise, for example, a chip or<br>
another electronic device . with comparable computing<br>
power.<br>
The control unit 4 is programmed in such a manner that,<br>
in the embodiment of the demand-controlled stimulus<br>
application described in section 6.3, a stimulus is<br>
generated and delivered to the electrode 2 in a<br>
stimulation interval predetermined by the control unit<br>
4. Overall, all parameters relevant to the respective<br>
procedure of the device according to the invention, for<br>
the type and intensity of the stimuli and their time<br>
delay and information relating to the electrode-related<br>
application and also the measurement values relevant<br>
for the demand-controlled operation and determined by<br>
the sensors 3, or parameters derived therefrom, are to<br>
be stored.<br>
The control unit 4 controls the electrode 2 preferably<br>
in the following manner: the control data are forwarded<br>
by the control unit 4 to an optical transmitter for the<br>
stimulation 5, which drives the optical receiver 7 via<br>
the optical waveguide 6. The optical coupling of<br>
control signals into the optical receiver 7 results in<br>
DC isolation of the control unit 4 from the electrode<br>
2. This means that injection of interference signals<br>
from the unit for signal processing and control 4 into<br>
the electrode 2 is prevented. The optical receiver<br><br>
7 to be considered is, for example, a photocell. The<br>
optical receiver 7 forwards the signals input via the<br>
optical transmitter for the stimulation 5 to the<br>
stimulator unit 8. Selective stimuli are then forwarded<br>
via the stimulator unit 8 to the target area in the<br>
brain via the electrode 2. In the case where<br>
measurements are also made via the electrode 2, a relay<br>
9 is also driven via the optical receiver 7 from the<br>
optical transmitter for the stimulation 5 which<br>
prevents interference signals from being injected. The<br>
relay 9 or the transistor ensures that the neural<br>
activity can be measured again immediately after each<br>
stimulus without the isolating amplifier being<br>
overdriven. The DC isolation does not mandatorily have<br>
to be reproduced by optically coupling in the control<br>
signals and, instead, other alternative control systems<br>
can be used. These can be, for example, acoustic links,<br>
for example in the ultrasonic range. Interference-free<br>
control can also be achieved, for example, by using<br>
suitable analog or digital filters.<br>
Furthermore, the device according to the invention is<br>
preferably connected to means for displaying and<br>
processing the measurement and/or stimulation signals<br>
and for saving data 13 via the telemetry receiver 12.<br>
In this arrangement, the unit 13 can have the methods<br>
for data analysis mentioned below.<br>
Furthermore, the device according to the invention can<br>
be connected to an additional reference database via<br>
the telemetry receiver 13 in order to monitor, for<br>
example, the correct operation of the device and<br>
possibly make the control mechanisms described in<br>
section 7.2 more efficient by modification of the<br>
parameters.<br><br>
In section 1, the mechanism of stimulation is explained<br>
in detail. Definitions of the most important terms can<br>
be found in section 2. The operating steps from the<br>
measurement of the neural activity via their processing<br>
up to the generation of the stimulation signal are<br>
explained in section 3. The spatial arrangement of the<br>
electrode and sensors is the subject matter of section<br>
4 . Section 5 deals with the self-regulating demand<br>
control of the stimulation signals. In sections 6 and<br>
7, the control of the stimulus application and the<br>
calibration and adaptation of the stimulation<br>
parameters is described. In section 8, examples and<br>
other possible uses and embodiments of the device are<br>
explained. The advantages of the device according to<br>
the invention are listed in section 9.<br>
1 Mechanism of stimulation<br>
The method according to the invention and the device<br>
can be used for decoupling, the driven neuron population<br>
from the driving neuron population. The driving neuron<br>
population can also be desynchronized. This relation is<br>
shown in figure 4.<br>
This is done by applying stimuli by means of an<br>
electrode, which are generated by measuring neural<br>
activity and, after any processing steps which may<br>
exist which preferably also include a time delay,<br>
converting it into a stimulation signal and further<br>
into a stimulation stimulus and applying it so that a<br>
decoupling and/or desynchronization surprisingly<br>
occurs. As described in section 3.1, the driven nerve<br>
cell population 2 is stimulated in the decoupling<br>
procedure (figure 4). In the desynchronizing procedure.,<br>
the driving<br><br>
neuron population 1 is stimulated. Using the device<br>
according to the invention and the stimulation method<br>
according to the invention, the nerve cell population<br>
to be decoupled is directly brought into a decoupled<br>
and desynchronized state or the population to be<br>
desynchronized is desynchronized. The desired state,<br>
that is to say the complete decoupling and/or<br>
desynchronization occurs typically during a few periods .<br>
of the neural activity, frequently in less than one<br>
period. The necessity of permanent or repetitive<br>
stimulation typically exists since the nerve cell<br>
population to be decoupled and/or to be desynchronized,<br>
according to experience, resynchronizes again due to<br>
the illness and/or due to the coupling, after the<br>
stimulation has been switched off. Since, according to<br>
the invention, the stimulation is directly associated<br>
with the neural activity, the amplitude of the<br>
resulting stimulation influence, i.e. the sum of the<br>
coupling and stimulation, on the neuron population to<br>
be decoupled or to be desynchronized is automatically<br>
minimized after successful decoupling and/or<br>
desynchronization. This is made possible due to the<br>
fact that the feedback stimulation signal, that is to<br>
say the processed neural activity, is used as<br>
stimulation stimulus, i.e. the extent of<br>
synchronization, and thus of the coupling, permanently<br>
controls the intensity and form of the stimulation<br>
signal. The stimulation signal applied compensates for<br>
the force of the external coupling and/or the internal<br>
synchronization so that the amplitude of the resultant<br>
stimulation influence on the neuron population to. be<br>
decoupled or to be desynchronized is minimized and<br>
their neural activity approaches closer to the natural<br>
physiological state. This process works for a large<br>
range of modifiable stimulation parameters such as, for<br>
example, stimulation period T, thfe time delay and the<br><br>
intensity, does not need any elaborate calibration and<br>
has a large error tolerance. Furthermore, the energy<br>
input into the tissue to be decoupled or to be<br>
desynchronized is minimized due to the direct<br>
relationship between the neural activity and<br>
stimulation patterns which allows fewer side effects to<br>
be expected.<br>
In the text which follows, the device according to the<br>
invention and its operation will be explained by way of<br>
example.<br>
The device according to the invention and the control<br>
system are equipped with means which can perform all<br>
steps of the treatment method according to the<br>
invention. With the method steps disclosed, means for<br>
carrying out the method step will also be disclosed<br>
implicitly. The method steps thus at the same time<br>
represent the functionalized device features.<br>
According to the invention, an electrode- is introduced<br>
into a brain area or - in the case of an epicortical<br>
electrode - attached to a brain area. This brain area<br>
is preferably selected in such a manner that it is<br>
connected directly or indirectly to one or more brain<br>
regions or belongs directly to one •of these regions<br>
which are responsible for forming the disease pattern<br>
or are driven by the pathological activity.<br>
In this context, the electrode delivers in its<br>
environment an electrical signal which produces a<br>
decoupling and/or a desynchronization directly in its<br>
environment or in another area conducted away via a<br>
nerve fiber bundle. To produce decoupling and/or<br>
desynchronization, the neural activity measured and<br>
processed, preferably delayed in time, is used as<br>
stimulation signal, see section 3. The device<br><br>
according to the invention therefore has a control<br>
system which drives the electrode 2 in such a manner<br>
that it effects a decoupling and/or a desynchronization<br>
in its closer environment and/or in another brain area<br>
by forwarding the stimulation via a fiber bundle.<br>
According to the invention, the electrode is driven<br>
with stimulation stimuli which are formed from the<br>
measured and processed neural activity with preferably<br>
a time delay of an integral multiple of T/2. T is the<br>
stimulation period and essentially approximates, as<br>
described below, the period of the rhythmic neural<br>
activity of the driving or driven neuron population. If<br>
the stimulating electrode 2 is not located in the area<br>
to be decoupled and to be desynchronized, the<br>
propagation time between the stimulus location and the<br>
location of the neuron population influenced by it must<br>
be taken into consideration when driving such an<br>
electrode 2. This is described in section 7.3.<br>
Surprisingly, this stimulation results in a decoupling<br>
and desynchronization of the entire neuron population<br>
to be decoupled and/or a desynchronization of the<br>
neuron population to be desynchronized which is<br>
associated with a suppression of the pathological<br>
symptoms. If the electrode 2 is located outside the<br>
area to be decoupled and to be desynchronized, effects<br>
of indirect stimulation must be taken into<br>
consideration as described in section 7.3.<br>
Using the novel method and the novel device, the aim of<br>
suppressing the pathological symptoms is achieved in a<br>
qualitatively different way in comparison with the<br>
above-mentioned prior art. Instead of suppressing the<br>
neural activity of the pathologically synchronous nerve<br>
cell population with a strong stimulation stimulus, the<br>
pathologically synchronous driving nerve cell<br>
population is simply desynchronized<br><br>
or another neuron population driven by the pathological<br>
activity is decoupled from this force and<br>
desynchronized which leads to a suppression of the<br>
pathological symptoms. The physiological activities of<br>
the individual neurons are not influenced. During this<br>
process, the neural activity processed according to<br>
section 3.3 is used at the location of the stimulus.<br>
The decoupling and/or desynchronization occurring<br>
surprisingly is supported by the interaction between<br>
the neurons in the driven area. This makes use of an<br>
active mechanism which is responsible for the<br>
pathological synchronization. Illustratively, the<br>
energy of the system to be influenced is used for<br>
achieving a therapeutic effect with minimum<br>
intervention. The best results are obtained if the<br>
stimulation stimuli are used which are generated from<br>
the stimulation signals whose time delays correspond to<br>
the integral multiple of half the stimulation period T.<br>
The stimulation period T approximates the period of the<br>
pathological activity. However, treatment successes are<br>
also achieved if the time delays of the stimuli<br>
delivered by the electrode 2 contain other time delays.<br>
In such a case, for example, at least a partial<br>
decoupling and/or desynchronization is produced.<br>
However, the more the time delays selected approach<br>
multiples of half the period of the pathological<br>
activity, the better will be the treatment results.<br>
2 Definition of terms<br>
Neural activity:<br>
The description of the mechanism of the device<br>
according to the invention is essentially based on the<br>
term of neural<br><br>
activity. The neural activity of the neuron population<br>
to be decoupled and/or of the neuron population to be<br>
desynchronized (see terms of the driving and driven<br>
populations) is measured, stored and, according to<br>
section 3.3, processed and used as feedback stimulation<br>
signal as a result of which the self-regulating demand<br>
control according to the invention is implemented. In<br>
the text which follows, the measured neural activity of<br>
the neuron population to be decoupled and/or of the<br>
neuron population to be desynchronized is understood to<br>
be a signal which reproduces the development with time<br>
of the activity of the neuron population to be<br>
decoupled and/or of the neuron population to be<br>
desynchronized. For example, local field potential can<br>
reproduce the development with time of the activity of<br>
the neuron population to be decoupled and/or of the<br>
neuron population to be desynchronized. The neural<br>
activity can be measured preferably directly in the<br>
area to be decoupled and/or in the area to be<br>
desynchronized but it is also possible to measure an<br>
activity associated with the neural activity of the<br>
area to be decoupled and/or of the area to be<br>
desynchronized, for example of another brain area, for<br>
example of the motor cortex and/or the pre-motor cortex<br>
or the activity of a muscle group to be controlled by<br>
the area to be decoupled and/or the area to be<br>
desynchronized. In a further embodiment of the device<br>
according to the invention, neural activities can be<br>
measured and combined at various locations in order to<br>
obtain an adequate representation of the neural<br>
activity of the neuron population to be decoupled<br>
and/or of the neuron population to be desynchronized.<br>
These quantities associated'with the neural activity of<br>
the area to be decoupled and/or of the area to be<br>
desynchronized will also be called neural activity in<br>
the text which follows and are comprised in this term.<br><br>
Rhythm:<br>
A rhythm is understood to be the rhythmic, that is to<br>
say approximately periodic neural activity which can be<br>
produced as a consequence of a pathologically excessive<br>
synchronous activity of nerve cells. A rhythm can occur<br>
for a short time or persist for a long time.<br>
Period:<br>
A central term for the device according to the<br>
invention is the period of the rhythmic neural activity<br>
which is used as time reference for the application of<br>
the stimulation stimuli. Adaptation of the stimulation<br>
period T, as described, for example, in section 7.2.1,<br>
preferably has the effect that the period of the<br>
rhythmic neural activity corresponds to the stimulation<br>
period T.<br>
Driving population:<br>
The driving population is understood to be the nerve<br>
cell population which generates the pathologically<br>
synchronous neural activity or reproduces the<br>
pathologically synchronous activity of a subordinate<br>
area. The driving population can forward the<br>
pathologically synchronous activity to the driven<br>
population (figure 4) . The pathological rhythm of the<br>
driving neuron population is produced (1) with<br>
involvement of essentially the entire driving neuron<br>
population and/or (2) in a part of the driving neuron<br>
population and/or (3) in a third neuron population<br>
different from the driving and driven neuron<br>
populations, which drives the driving neuron<br>
population. In case of (3), the driving neuron<br>
population itself is a driven neuron population. The<br>
driving neuron population is also called the population<br>
to be desynchronized<br><br>
or area to be desynchronized. The driving nerve cell<br>
population is not tied to atomical boundaries. Instead,<br>
it can also be understood to be at least one component<br>
consisting of the group of:<br>
-	at least one part of at least one anatomical area,<br>
-	at least one complete anatomical area.<br>
Driven population:<br>
Driven population is understood to be the nerve cell<br>
population which is influenced directly or indirectly<br>
via the driving population . (figure 4). Direct<br>
influencing means influencing via fibers which connect<br>
the two populations directly - i.e. without<br>
interposition of another population. Indirect<br>
influencing means influencing via at least one<br>
interposed population. The nerve cell population which<br>
is influenced by the driving population is also called<br>
the neuron population to be decoupled or area to be<br>
decoupled. The area to be decoupled is not tied to<br>
anatomical boundaries. Instead, it can also be<br>
understood to be at least one component consisting of<br>
the group of:<br>
-	at least a part of at least one anatomical area,<br>
-	at least one complete anatomical area.<br>
The connection of the areas of nucleus subthalamicus -<br>
globus pallidus exterior, which, due to the disease,<br>
act as pacemakers and can generate a pathologically<br>
rhythmic synchronous activity, can be used as an<br>
example of a driving neuron population. The synchronous<br><br>
activity generated controls the neural activity of the<br>
cerebrum area, e.g. of the motor cortex which can here<br>
be called the driven population and is also connected<br>
to muscles and controls their activity.<br>
Decoupling stimulation:<br>
A decoupling stimulation in the sense of the invention<br>
is understood to be a stimulation which minimizes the<br>
pathologically driving effect of the driving neuron<br>
population on the driven neuron population to such an<br>
extent that it no longer plays a role functionally -<br>
that is to say for the instancing of the symptoms.<br>
Target population:<br>
In the text which follows, the target population is<br>
understood to be the nerve cell population stimulated<br>
directly by an implanted stimulation electrode. A<br>
target population is stimulated directly by an<br>
electrode implanted in it or close to it. The<br>
populations to be decoupled and/or to be desynchronized<br>
are stimulated either directly or indirectly.<br>
Direct stimulation:<br>
In this case, the stimulation electrode 2 is located<br>
directly in the area to be decoupled or in the area to<br>
be desynchronized. This electrode 2 influences the<br>
target population which is located in the area to be<br>
decoupled or in the area to be desynchronized.<br>
Indirect stimulation:<br>
In this case, the area to be decoupled or the area to<br>
be desynchronized is not stimulated directly by means<br>
of the stimulation electrode 2. Instead, a target<br>
population or a fiber bundle which is functionally<br>
closely connected<br><br>
to the area to be decoupled or the area to be<br>
desynchronized is stimulated by the electrode 2. In<br>
this process, the stimulation effect on the area to be<br>
decoupled or the area to be desynchronized is conducted<br>
away preferably via anatomical connections. For the<br>
indirect stimulation, the term target area will be<br>
introduced as generic term for target population and<br>
fiber bundle. Of the term target area, the neuron<br>
population functionally closely connected to the area<br>
to be decoupled or the area to be desynchronized, and<br>
the connecting fiber bundle are to be understood in the<br>
text which follows which are stimulated directly by the<br>
implanted electrode 2 .<br>
Time delay:<br>
The device according to the invention forwards signals<br>
to the stimulation electrode 2 which, according to<br>
section 3.2, can correspond to measured and possibly<br>
processed neural activity (= feedback stimulation<br>
signal) at an earlier time. This time shift will be<br>
called time delay in the text which follows and<br>
represents an important stimulation parameter<br>
associated with the stimulation period T, which<br>
corresponds to the period of rhythmic neural activity.<br>
Feedback stimulation signal:<br>
Feedback stimulation signal or stimulation signal is<br>
understood to be the signal which represents the<br>
measured and processed neural activity and is used as<br>
basis for the stimulation stimuli. The processing steps<br>
can be carried out, for example, as described in<br>
section 3.3. The stimulation signal is composed of the<br>
processed neural activity and used for stimulating the<br>
brain area to be decoupled or the brain area to be<br>
desynchronized. Performing<br><br>
the feedback stimulation, signal, it may be necessary to<br>
generate measurement signals by multiple processing<br>
steps, which are possibly independent of one another,<br>
with different processing parameters (particularly<br>
different time delays) which are then e.g. added and/or<br>
multiplied and/or divided and/or subtracted and/or<br>
calculated by means of other nonlinear functions, for<br>
forming the actual stimulation signal. From the<br>
feedback stimulation signals, stimulation stimuli are<br>
generated and then applied to the target population by<br>
means of the electrode.<br>
Resultant stimulation influence<br>
The resultant stimulation influence on the neuron<br>
populations to be decoupled or the neuron populations<br>
to be desynchronized is understood to be the sum of the<br>
external forces applied to the population to be<br>
decoupled and/or to be desynchronized. According to<br>
section 3.1, in one embodiment of the device according<br>
to the invention, the driven neuron population is<br>
decoupled from the driving neuron population by means<br>
of direct or indirect stimulation. In this case, the<br>
resultant stimulation influence on the population to be<br>
decoupled is the sum of the stimulation signal and of<br>
the driving force of the coupling to the driving<br>
population. In another embodiment of the device<br>
according to the invention, the driving, population to<br>
be desynchronized is desynchronized by means of the<br>
stimulation. The resultant stimulation influence on the<br>
population to be desynchronized is here only the<br>
stimulation signal. Due to the self-regulating demand<br>
control described in section 5, the amplitude of the<br>
resultant stimulation influence on the neuron<br>
population to be decoupled or the neuron population to<br>
be desynchronized<br><br>
is automatically minimized after successful decoupling<br>
and/or desynchronization.<br>
3 Stimulation method and form of stimulus<br>
3.1 Decoupling and desynchronizing method<br>
A pathologically synchronous neuron population in a<br>
brain area can act as driving force on another<br>
following neuron population due to rhythmic activity.<br>
This can result in an interaction scheme in the form of<br>
"driving population - driven population" between the<br>
populations as is shown diagrammatically in figure 4.<br>
If the driving force is strong enough, the driven<br>
neuron population will also become synchronized which<br>
can produce the pathological symptoms. This occurs when<br>
the driven population drives the muscles-as is the case<br>
in the premotor cortex or motor cortex.<br>
As described in section 1, it is the aim of the' device<br>
according to the invention and of the stimulation<br>
methods according to the invention to desyn'chronize the<br>
pathologically synchronous neural activity which allows<br>
the suppression of the symptoms to be expected. In the<br>
case of the decoupling stimulation mode, the driven<br>
neuron population 2 is decoupled from the driving<br>
population 1, and desynchronized, or, in the case of<br>
the desynchronizing stimulation mode, the driving<br>
neuron population 1 is desynchronized, for this<br>
purpose.<br>
In the decoupling stimulation mode, the driven neuron<br>
population 2 is stimulated directly or indirectly<br>
according to sections 3.4 and 4.1 by means of a<br>
stimulation electrode. The stimulation produces a<br>
decoupling of the neuron population from the driving<br>
neuron population 1 which results in a<br>
desynchronization of the population 2.<br><br>
In the desynchronizing stimulation mode,, the driving<br>
neuron population 1 is stimulated directly or<br>
indirectly by means of a stimulation electrode. By<br>
means of this stimulation, population 1 is<br>
desynchronized so that its driving force on the<br>
population 2 disappears. The latter is also<br>
desynchronized as a result of which the pathological<br>
symptoms are suppressed. If population 2 synchronizes<br>
itself, it must be desynchronized directly like a<br>
driving neuron population.<br>
According to section 5, a self-regulating demand<br>
control of the stimulation signal occurs in the two<br>
above-mentioned stimulation methods, wherein the<br>
resultant stimulation influence on the stimulated<br>
neuron population is automatically minimized. According<br>
to section 2, the resultant stimulation influence on<br>
the driven neuron population in the decoupling<br>
stimulation mode is the sum of the stimulation signal<br>
and of the driving force of the driving population. In<br>
the desynchronizing stimulation method, the resultant<br>
stimulation influence on the driving neuron population<br>
is exclusively the influence of the stimulation signal.<br>
In the text which follows, an embodiment of the device<br>
according to the invention is described by way of<br>
example, namely the decoupling stimulation mode in<br>
which the neuron population to be decoupled is<br>
decoupled from the driving neuron population by means<br>
of direct or indirect stimulation. The further<br>
embodiments of the device according to the invention<br>
are described in section 8.<br>
3.2 Measuring the neural activity<br>
The variation with time of the neural activity of the<br>
area to be decoupled and/or of the driving area can be<br>
measured directly and/or indirectly via the sensors 3.<br><br>
In the case of an indirect measurement, the variation<br>
with time of the activity of a muscle group influenced<br>
by the area to be decoupled and/or of the driving area<br>
and/or the variation with time of the activity of a<br>
neuron population associated with the area to be<br>
decoupled and/or the driving area is measured.<br>
The sensors 3 (see figure 1) are located in- the brain<br>
and/or outside the brain. In the brain, they are<br>
positioned in the area to be decoupled and/or the<br>
driving area and/or in at least one other area<br>
functionally connected thereto. Outside the brain, the<br>
sensors 3 are located on body parts which are connected<br>
to the pathologically synchronized neural activity,<br>
e.g. as electrodes in a trembling muscle. The measured<br>
signals of the neural activity of the neuron<br>
populations, for example of the muscular activity<br>
(which is also called neural activity, see section 2)<br>
are processed and stored in a unit for signal<br>
processing 4. The measuring, processing and storing can<br>
be carried out permanently- or at discrete time<br>
intervals. In the latter case, the duration and/or the<br>
intervals of the discrete measuring intervals are<br>
determined by a deterministic and/or stochastic<br>
algorithm.<br>
3.3 Processing the neural measurement signals<br>
The measurement signals stored in the unit for signal<br>
processing 4 are then processed in order to be<br>
available as feedback stimulation signals. The<br>
following processing steps can be applied:<br>
1. The measured neural activity can be filtered, e.g.<br>
the neural activity can be band-pass filtered. The<br>
filtering may be necessary if, apart from the<br><br>
disease-related activity, non-disease-related<br>
activity is measured via sensor 3, for example from<br>
other neuron populations. Since the disease-related<br>
activity typically occurs in a frequency range<br>
which differs from the frequency range of the non-<br>
disease-related activity, the activity is<br>
preferably determined in the disease-related<br>
frequency range in this case. This is achieved, for<br>
example, by means of a frequency analysis.<br>
Similarly, it may be necessary to perform a wavelet<br>
analysis and/or a Hilbert transformation and/or<br>
filtering in the time domain.<br>
2.	If the neural activity of the neuron population to<br>
be decoupled and/or of the neuron population to be<br>
desynchronized is measured via a number of sensors<br>
3, the measured neural activities can be combined<br>
linearly and/or nonlinearly. For example, the<br>
measured neural signals are multiplied, divided,<br>
added and/or subtracted with one another or with<br>
themselves and/or transformed by means of other<br>
nonlinear functions.<br>
3.	The measured neural activity is delayed in time.<br>
The time delays used for this purpose are defined<br>
in section 3.4 and also take into consideration the<br>
position of the stimulation electrode with respect<br>
to the neuron population to be decoupled, according<br>
to section 7.3. In addition, the time delays can be<br>
adapted preferably during the stimulation according<br>
to section 7.2.1 and 7.2.2.<br>
4.	The measured neural activity is amplified. The<br>
measured neural activity is typically less by a few<br>
orders of magnitude than the stimulation<br><br>
amplitudes which, according to experience, lead to<br>
a stimulation effect. For this reason,<br>
. amplification must be carried out which can be<br>
adapted during the stimulation according to section<br>
7.2.3.<br>
5.	The measured neural activity is time-coded. Since<br>
signals with large gradients have a great effect on<br>
the neural dynamics, the measured neural activity<br>
is coded, for example, in the form of pulse trains<br>
or low- or high-frequency pulse trains- consisting<br>
of short rectangular pulses. To enhance the effect<br>
of the stimulation, other coding methods can also<br>
be used.<br>
6.	The polarity of the neural activity is changed.<br>
7.	The neural activity is transformed linearly and/or<br>
nonlinearly. This can be done, e.g. with the aid of<br>
the Hilbert and/or Fourier and/or wavelet<br>
transformation.<br>
8.	The maximum amplitude of the stimulation signal is<br>
limited.<br>
9.	The measured neural activity is transformed in such<br>
a way that stimulation signals are produced whose<br>
net charge input is essentially zero.<br>
10.	The measured neural activity is used directly as<br>
feedback stimulation signal.<br>
The processed neural activity, i.e. the feedback<br>
stimulation signal, is determined by applying at least<br>
one component of the above-mentioned processing steps.<br>
For example, the stimulation signals can be generated<br>
from the measured neural activity using always the same<br>
processing steps. As well, the set of<br><br>
treatment steps and/or their parameters can be varied<br>
in time by a deterministic and/or stochastic and/or<br>
combined stochastic/deterministic algorithm.<br>
3.4 Form of the stimulation stimulus<br>
A stimulation stimulus is understood to be a stimulus<br>
which is applied via the electrode 2 and acts in a time<br>
interval. To form a stimulation stimulus, the feedback<br>
stimulation signals, that is to say the neural activity<br>
processed according to section 3.3, are used. To<br>
generate stimulation stimuli, the stimulation signals<br>
are, for example, multiplied, divided, added and/or<br>
subtracted with one another and/or with themselves<br>
and/or transformed by means of other nonlinear<br>
functions.<br>
The time delays used during the processing of the<br>
neural activity are specified, for example, as<br>
fractions of the period of the oscillatory neural<br>
activity to be decoupled and/or driving neural activity<br>
and are preferably essentially a multiple of one Nth of<br>
the period, where N is a small integral number, for<br>
example 2. The time delays of the stimulation signals<br>
can also be selected, e.g., to be greater than the<br>
stimulation period T. The device according to the<br>
invention also provides the possibility of using a<br>
number of preferably different time delays for forming<br>
the stimulation stimulus. The resultant time-delayed<br>
feedback stimulation signals can be combined linearly<br>
and/or nonlinearly to form a stimulation stimulus.<br>
For this purpose, the device according to the invention<br>
has means which apply the electrical stimulation<br>
stimulus described in the manner described. The means<br>
are the electrode 2, a control system 4 which delivers<br>
control signals to the electrode 2 for delivering these<br>
stimuli. Furthermore<br><br>
sensors 3 and the unit for signal processing 4 which<br>
receives the neural activity and prepares it for<br>
further use as stimulation stimulus. A stimulation<br>
stimulus is preferably generated, the net charge input<br>
of which is essentially zero.<br>
For example, the electrode 2 can be driven with the<br>
same stimulation stimulus in the form of the same<br>
processed neural activity according to section 3.3. The<br>
electrode 2 can also be driven with different<br>
stimulation signals and/or combinations of the<br>
stimulation signals and/or by means of different<br>
transformations and/or combinations of the stimulation<br>
signals.<br>
The order and/or the type and/or the energy input<br>
and/or the parameters of stimuli can be determined by<br>
means of a deterministic and/or stochastic and/or<br>
combined stochastic/deterministic algorithm.<br>
The time delays and/or polarity and/or application<br>
period and/or intensity of the stimulation stimulus,<br>
used in the processing steps, see section 3.3, can be<br>
varied systematically or randomly controlled, that is<br>
to say in accordance with a deterministic or stochastic<br>
rule. For this purpose, the device according to the<br>
invention has a control system which is programmed in<br>
such a manner that it deterministically and/or<br>
stochastically activates the time delays and/or the<br>
polarity and/or the application period and/or the<br>
intensity of the processing steps of the stimulation<br>
stimulus.<br>
By varying the time delays and/or the polarity and/or<br>
the application period and/or the intensity within the<br>
processing steps of the stimulation signal, adaptation<br>
processes in the neuron populations which<br><br>
produce an increase in the stimulation intensity in<br>
order to achieve the same therapeutic effect, can be<br>
prevented.<br>
4 Spatial arrangement of the electrode and sensors<br>
4.1	Stimulation electrode<br>
An electrode 2 is preferably used for the stimulation.<br>
In the case where the electrode 2 is positioned in the<br>
nerve cell population to be decoupled, the electrode<br>
should be arranged preferably in such a manner that the<br>
electrode can be used for stimulating the entire nerve<br>
cell population to be decoupled. This can be achieved<br>
by geometric positioning of the electrode. For example,<br>
the electrode 2 can be positioned in the center of the<br>
area to be decoupled.<br>
In the case where the electrode 2 is not positioned in<br>
the nerve cell population to be decoupled, stimulation<br>
is applied in a target area which differs from the area<br>
to be decoupled in this form of stimulation. The<br>
indirect stimulation can then be applied by stimulation<br>
of a neuron population which differs from the nerve<br>
cell population to be decoupled and/or by stimulating a<br>
fiber bundle connected to the nerve cell population to<br>
be decoupled.<br>
4.2	Number of sensors<br>
The mechanism of the device according to the invention<br>
essentially consists in that, as described in section 1<br>
and 3, the measured and processed neural activities of<br>
the neuron population to be decoupled and/or of the<br>
driving neuron population are applied again as<br>
stimulation. The sensors 3 are one of the . most<br>
important components<br><br>
of the device according to the invention and can be<br>
positioned either outside the neuron population to be<br>
decoupled and the driving neuron population or<br>
preferably directly in the neuron population to be<br>
decoupled and/or the driving neuron population, as<br>
described in section 3.2. Only one sensor 3 is<br>
preferably used for detecting the activity of the<br>
neuron population to be decoupled and/or of the driving<br>
neuron population. As a result, the number of sensors<br>
to be implanted is kept as small as■possible in order<br>
to prevent unnecessary tissue damage and, especially,<br>
brain bleeding during the implantation. However, two or<br>
more sensors can also be used, for example, in order to<br>
reconstruct the neural activity of the neuron<br>
population to be decoupled and/or of the driving neuron<br>
population much more completely as combination of the<br>
measured activities.<br>
Furthermore, possible brain damage caused by the<br>
implantation is reduced further or avoided, and the<br>
stimulation effect is improved, by combining at least<br>
one sensor 3 and stimulation electrode 2 in one<br>
electrode to be implanted.<br>
In the case where the sensors 3 are all positioned in<br>
the nerve cell population to be decoupled and/or the<br>
driving nerve cell population, the sensors 3 should be<br>
arranged preferably in such a manner that a large<br>
proportion of the nerve cell population to be decoupled<br>
and/or of the driving nerve cell population can be<br>
covered by means of the sensors. This can be achieved<br>
with a geometric arrangement of the sensors with regard<br>
to the tissue to be decoupled and/or the driving<br>
tissue. In the case of arrangement with only one sensor<br>
3, the latter can be located, for example, in the<br>
center of the tissue. In the case of arrangements .with<br>
a number of sensors, the sensors can be arranged, for<br>
example, in a symmetric manner.<br><br>
In the case where at least one of the sensors 3 is not<br>
positioned in the nerve cell population to be decoupled<br>
and the driving nerve cell population, an activity<br>
associated with the neural activity of the neuron<br>
population to be decoupled and/or the driving neuron<br>
population is measured in at least one area different<br>
from the area to be decoupled and the driving area in<br>
this form of activity measurement. As described in<br>
section 3.2, the indirect measurement can be effected<br>
by measuring the activity of a neuron •population<br>
different from the nerve cell population to be<br>
decoupled and the driving nerve cell population and/or<br>
of a fiber bundle and/or of a body part which is<br>
connected to the nerve cell population to be<br>
decoupled/the driving nerve cell population.<br>
5 Self-regulating demand control of the stimulation<br>
signal<br>
One of the most important characteristics of the<br>
mechanism of the device according to the invention is a<br>
self-regulating demand control of the stimulation<br>
signal. The self regulation described occurs due to the<br>
fact that the stimulation stimuli consist of the neural<br>
activity processed. In the case of a more intensive<br>
synchronous activity in the area, to be decoupled and/or<br>
of a coupling with the driving population of the area<br>
to be decoupled, a great variance of the measured<br>
neural activity must be expected as is known to the<br>
expert. This leads directly to a stimulation,, time<br>
delayed in accordance with the invention, with<br>
increased stimulation amplitude. According to the<br>
invention, and illustratively, the force of the applied<br>
stimulation signal compensates for the force of the<br>
internal synchronization and/or the coupling with the<br>
driving population of the area to be decoupled,<br>
resulting in decoupling and desynchronization<br><br>
of the population to be decoupled. As a result, the<br>
amplitude of the resultant stimulation influence on the<br>
population to be decoupled, i.e. the sum of the<br>
stimulation and coupling, is independently minimized.<br>
After decoupling and. desynchronization has been<br>
achieved, a neural activity of little variance is<br>
expected as a result of which the stimulation signals<br>
are influenced directly and are independently adapted.<br>
If a new coupling and/or resynchronization again<br>
occurs, the device according to the invention<br>
automatically takes into account the increased demand<br>
for decoupling and/or desynchronizing stimulation in<br>
that the greater variance of the neural activity leads<br>
to a stronger stimulation stimulus being formed. This<br>
represents' a self-regulating demand control of the<br>
device according to the invention.<br>
The mechanism forming the basis of the self-regulating<br>
demand control acts in all embodiments of the device<br>
according to the invention, described in greater detail<br>
in the text which follows.<br>
6 Control of the stimulus application<br>
The temporal control of the stimulus application is<br>
understood to be an embodiment of the device according<br>
to the invention which is preferably programmed in<br>
advance, the stimulation stimulus being applied in a<br>
particular way by means of the stimulator unit 8. The<br>
variants of the temporal control of the stimulus<br>
application are permanent, repetitive and demand-<br>
controlled stimulation application. In addition, a<br>
manual demand control can be implemented, for example<br>
for a stimulus application carried out by the patient<br>
or the doctor.<br><br>
6.1	Permanent stimulus application<br>
In the permanent stimulus application, the device<br>
according to the invention has a control system which<br>
is programmed in such a manner that it performs a<br>
continuous application of the stimulation stimulus at<br>
the electrode 2. The permanent .stimulus application<br>
represents the simplest, and easily implemented<br>
embodiment of the device according to the invention. At<br>
the same time, the permanent stimulation produces a<br>
good decoupling and de-synchronizing effect with little<br>
energy input into the population to be decoupled due to<br>
the self-regulating demand control according to the<br>
invention, described in section 5.<br>
During the permanent stimulus application, the<br>
intensity parameters can be adapted in accordance with<br>
section 7.2.3. Similarly, the time parameters<br>
stimulation period T and/or time delay - can be.adapted<br>
during the permanent stimulation in accordance with<br>
section 7.2.1 and 7.2.2 in combination with an<br>
adaptation of the stimulation intensity or<br>
independently thereof.<br>
6.2	Repetitive stimulus application<br>
In the repetitive stimulus application, the device<br>
according to the invention has a control system which<br>
is programmed in such a manner that it performs" an<br>
application of the stimulation stimulus at the<br>
electrode 2 only during particular time intervals.<br>
There is no stimulation outside these time intervals.<br>
In the repetitive stimulus application, the stimulation<br>
stimulus can be imparted strictly periodically in time<br>
or nonperiodically in time. In this embodiment, the<br>
device according to the invention has a control system<br>
which is programmed in such a manner that it controls<br>
the time intervals between the stimulation intervals<br>
and/or the duration of the intervals periodically<br>
and/or non-periodically. A temporally non-periodic<br>
sequence of the stimulation<br><br>
stimulus can be generated by a stochastic and/or<br>
deterministic and/or combined stochastic/deterministic<br>
algorithm in order to achieve the desired decoupled and<br>
desynchronized state of the population to be decoupled.<br>
Analogously, in the text which follows, a combination<br>
of deterministic and stochastic rules is understood to<br>
be a functional relationship in which deterministic and<br>
stochastic terms are functionally linked to one<br>
another, e.g. by addition and/or multiplication.<br>
The stimulation and measuring intervals can be arranged<br>
to overlap or to occur at the same time or separated in<br>
time. During the repetitive stimulus application, the<br>
intensity parameters can be adapted according to<br>
section 7.2.3. Similarly, the time parameters<br>
stimulation period T and/or time delays - can be<br>
adapted during the repetitive stimulation according to<br>
section 7.2.1 and 7.2.2, in combination with an<br>
adaptation of the stimulation intensity or<br>
independently thereof.<br>
6.3 Demand-controlled stimulus application<br>
In the demand-controlled stimulus • application, the<br>
device according to the invention has a control system<br>
which is programmed in such a manner that it performs<br>
the switching-on and -off of the stimulation stimulus<br>
in accordance with the particular states of the neuron<br>
population to be decoupled and/or the driving neuron<br>
population. For this purpose, the control unit 4 uses<br>
the measurement signals and/or the stimulation signals<br>
for detecting a pathological feature. The stimulation<br>
is switched on, for example as described in the text<br>
which follows.<br>
The activity of the neuron population to be decoupled<br>
and/or of the driving population is measured via the<br>
sensor 3. The neural activity is forwarded to the unit<br>
4 for signal processing and/or control which, among<br>
other things,<br><br>
acts as means for detecting a pathological feature. As<br>
soon as the unit 4 for signal processing and/or control<br>
detects a pathological feature in the neural activity,<br>
the application of a stimulation stimulus is started.<br>
As soon as the pathological feature disappears due to<br>
the effect of the stimulation applied, the stimulation<br>
is preferably switched off. The device according to the<br>
invention therefore comprises in one possible<br>
embodiment as unit 4 for signal processing and/or<br>
control, a computer which contains a data medium which<br>
carries the data of the disease pattern and compares it<br>
with the measurement data. Data of the disease pattern<br>
are understood to be parameters and measurement<br>
variables of relevance to the stimulation, for example<br>
the instantaneous frequency of the neural activity<br>
measured via the sensor 3, of the threshold value<br>
necessary for the procedure of the demand-controlled<br>
stimulus application, the stimulation parameters which<br>
specify the stimulus intensity. A pathological feature<br>
is understood to be, for example, a disease-related<br>
synchronization of the neuron population to be<br>
decoupled/of the driving neuron population and can be<br>
recognized by the following characteristics of the<br>
neural activity:<br>
a) If via the sensor 3, it is exclusively or<br>
predominantly the pathological activity of the<br>
neuron population to be decoupled and/or of the<br>
driving neuron population which is measured as, e.g.<br>
in the direct measurement described in section 3.2<br>
and section 4.2, the neural activity is used<br>
directly for determining whether the amplitude of<br>
the neural activity exceeds a threshold value. In a<br>
preferred embodiment, the device according to the<br>
invention is therefore equipped with means for<br>
detecting a value of the amplitude of the neural<br>
activity which corresponds to the threshold value.<br>
In<br><br>
this case, the neural activity itself and/or its<br>
amount and/or its amplitude is preferably compared<br>
with the threshold value. In this embodiment, the<br>
means for detecting the threshold value can be<br>
programmed in such a manner that it compares, for<br>
example, the neural activity itself and/or its<br>
amount and/or its amplitude with the threshold<br>
value. The amplitude is determined either in a<br>
simple version by determining the amount of the<br>
signal and/or with band-pass filtering and/or<br>
Hilbert transformation and/or wavelet analysis. In'<br>
this case, the unit 4 for signal processing is<br>
programmed in such a manner that it can perform a<br>
determination of the amount of the signal and/or<br>
band-pass filtering and/or Hilbert transformation<br>
and/or a wavelet analysis. The neural activity or<br>
its amount is especially preferably used since the<br>
calculation of the amplitude means a distinctly<br>
higher computational effort and the amplitude cannot<br>
be determined on a single measurement value of the<br>
neural activity but must be determined in a<br>
sufficiently large time interval known to the expert<br>
which can slightly delay the detection of the<br>
pathological feature.<br>
If, in addition to this pathological activity of the<br>
neuron population to be decoupled and/or the driving<br>
neuron population, non-disease-specific activity is<br>
additionally measured via the sensor 3, for example<br>
from other neuron populations as, e.g. in the<br>
indirect measurement described in sections 3.2 and<br>
4.2, a further algorithmic step must be inserted in<br>
the analysis of the neural activity. Since the<br>
disease-specific activity occurs typically in a<br>
frequency range which differs from the frequency<br>
range of the<br><br>
non-disease-specific activity, it is sufficient for<br>
this purpose to preferably perform an estimation of<br>
the activity in the disease-specific frequency<br>
range. The frequency of the disease-specific<br>
activity is determined, for example, by determining<br>
the difference of successive trigger points. Trigger<br>
points are points such as maxima, minima, turning<br>
points and zero transitions. This analysis is<br>
preferably performed in a sliding time window,<br>
forming the . mean value of a number of temporal<br>
differences which increases the stability. As an<br>
alternative, the frequency can also be estimated<br>
with the spectral estimating methods known to the<br>
expert and other frequency estimators such as, e.g.<br>
with the aid of a Fourier analysis. For this<br>
purpose, the device according to the invention, in a<br>
particular embodiment, has means for estimating the<br>
activity in the disease-specific frequency range<br>
such as spectral estimating methods, Fourier and/or<br>
wavelet analysis etc. This is implemented, for<br>
example, by means for performing a frequency<br>
analysis. For example, the spectral energy in the<br>
disease-specific frequency range can be determined<br>
in a sliding window. As an alternative, the<br>
amplitude in the disease-specific frequency range<br>
can be determined, after band-pass filtering, by<br>
determining the maximum of the band-pass-filtered<br>
signal or by determining the mean value of the<br>
amount of the band-pass-filtered signal and/or by<br>
Hilbert transformation and/or by wavelet analysis.<br>
For this purpose, the device according to the<br>
invention has, for example, means for band-pass<br>
filtering the amplitude and means for determining<br>
the maximum of the band-pass filtered signal and/or<br>
means for determining the mean value of the amount<br>
of the band-pass filtered<br><br>
signal and/or means for performing a Hilbert<br>
transformation and/or a wavelet analysis.<br>
In the case of demand-controlled stimulus application,<br>
the same stimulation stimulus is always used, for<br>
example. The stimulation period T is preferably<br>
adapted, as described in section 7.2.1 to the<br>
instantaneous frequency of the neuron population to be<br>
decoupled and/or of the neuron population to be driven.<br>
When the pathological feature is present, a stimulus is<br>
then applied with a stimulation period T adapted to the<br>
instantaneous frequency. Similarly, the time delays can<br>
be adapted according to section 7.2.2 and/or the<br>
intensity of this stimulus remains preferably constant.<br>
However, the intensity parameters can also be modified<br>
in accordance with the stimulation effect as in section<br>
7.2.3.<br>
6.3.1 Determining the demand<br>
There are at least two reasons why there is no<br>
unambiguous relation between the instance of the<br>
pathological feature and the instance of the disease-<br>
specific symptoms. On the one hand, the distance of the<br>
sensor 3 from the area to be decoupled and/or the<br>
driving area in which the neural activity to be<br>
measured is generated results in a change in the<br>
amplitude in the disease-specific frequency range. On<br>
the other hand, a particular instance of the disease-<br>
specific feature, that is to say the instance of the<br>
rhythmic activity in the disease-specific frequency<br>
range, is not unambiguously associated with the<br>
disease-specific symptoms. Since the disease-specific<br>
rhythm has effects on complex neural networks in the<br>
brain which, in addition, typically do not . obey simple<br>
linear dynamic rules, there are no unambiguous<br>
relations between disease-specific rhythm and the<br>
instance of symptoms. If, for example, the disease-<br>
specific rhythm does not sufficiently correspond<br><br>
to the biomechanically determined natural frequency of<br>
an extremity, the tremor caused by the disease-specific<br>
rhythm is distinctly less than if the disease-specific<br>
rhythm resonates with the biomechanically predetermined<br>
natural frequency of the extremity.<br>
The characteristics such as, e.g. the dominant<br>
frequency and the amplitude of the measured neural<br>
activity lie in a range of experience known to the<br>
expert. The value of the instance of the disease-<br>
specific feature of the neural activity measured via<br>
sensor 3 is called the threshold, the transgression of<br>
which typically gives rise to the occurrence of<br>
symptoms, for example of the tremor. The threshold is a<br>
parameter which must be selected for the embodiment of<br>
the demand-controlled stimulus application described in<br>
section 6.3. The device according to the invention,<br>
therefore, comprises means for detecting a threshold<br>
value in the form of the control unit 4. The method of<br>
demand-controlled stimulus application according to the<br>
invention achieves the advantage that the effectiveness<br>
of the device according to the invention does not<br>
critically depend on the choice of threshold but a<br>
large error tolerance with respect to the choice of<br>
threshold is given which lies, for example, within a<br>
range of up to 50% of the maximum instance of the<br>
disease-specific feature. The choice of threshold is<br>
determined either intraoperatively or preferably in- the<br>
first case after the operation by measuring the neural<br>
activity via sensor 3 with determination of the<br>
instance of the disease-specific feature and comparison<br>
with the instance of the symptoms, e.g. the intensity<br>
of the trembling.<br>
In a less preferred embodiment of the demand-controlled<br>
stimulus application, the threshold is taken to be<br><br>
a representative value, for example the mean value of a<br>
collective of threshold values measured in patients. In<br>
a preferred embodiment, the choice of threshold is<br>
checked in essentially regular intervals, for example<br>
during half-yearly controls.<br>
In the embodiments of the permanent and repetitive<br>
stimulation with demand-controlled stimulus intensity,<br>
described in sections 6.1 and 6.2, no threshold value<br>
detection is necessary.<br>
The three stimulation methods described above can be<br>
used preferably in different combination with the<br>
methods for adapting the stimulation parameters,<br>
described in section 7.2.<br>
All three stimulation methods have in common the<br>
inherent self-regulating demand control according to<br>
the invention. The direct dependence of the stimulation<br>
signal on the neural activity measured necessitates a<br>
self-regulating demand control, described in section 5,<br>
as a result of which the energy input into the<br>
population to be decoupled is minimized. This self-<br>
regulating demand control acts independently of the<br>
implementation of the additional demand control<br>
described in section 6.3 and of the calibration and<br>
control of the parameters as described in section 7.<br>
7 Calibration and adaptation of the parameters<br>
In the text which follows, it is assumed that the<br>
electrode 2 is located in the neuron population to be<br>
decoupled. The case where the electrode is located<br>
outside the neuron population to be decoupled is<br>
considered separately at the end of the section. A<br>
calibration and adaptation,<br><br>
can be performed for the following parameters of the<br>
device according to the invention., for example: the<br>
frequency of the stimulation signals, the reciprocal of<br>
which corresponds to the stimulation period, the time<br>
delays of the stimulation signals and the intensity of<br>
the stimulation stimulus.<br>
7.1 Stimulation parameters at the beginning of the<br>
stimulation<br>
7.1.1 Frequency, stimulation period<br>
Choice of frequency without previous operation of the<br>
device: the frequency range of the pathological neural<br>
activity is known to the expert for the respective<br>
disease patterns (Elble R.J. and Roller W.C. (1990):<br>
Tremor, John Hopkins University Press, Baltimore). Of<br>
this frequency range, the mean value can be preferably<br>
taken. As an alternative, the value of the frequency to<br>
be expected in relation to age and sex can be used<br>
instead.<br>
For a successful operation of the device according to<br>
the invention, it is not necessary that the frequency<br>
initially predetermined corresponds to the frequency of<br>
the activity of the neuron population to be decoupled<br>
or of the activity of the driving neuron population,<br>
actually present. The control of the stimulation period<br>
T described at 7.2.1 functions even when an initial<br>
value is used which deviates greatly from the correct<br>
frequency value. Deviates greatly means that the value<br>
can also be too large or too small by a factor of at<br>
least 10. As an alternative, it is thus also possible<br>
to preferably begin with a frequency value which lies<br>
within the frequency range typical of the disease and<br>
known to the expert. The value of the frequency at the<br>
beginning of the stimulation can also be preferably<br>
obtained by individual adaptation to the respective<br>
patient. This can be achieved, for example, by a<br>
measurement of the neural activity and estimation<br><br>
of the dominant frequency of the activity of the neuron<br>
population to be decoupled and/or the driving neuron<br>
population as described in section 6.3, in preparation<br>
for the stimulation.<br>
Choice of frequency with previous operation of the<br>
device: the starting value for the frequency is<br>
selected to be the mean value of the frequency during<br>
the preceding operation of the device.<br>
In both cases, that is to say with and without previous<br>
operation of the device, the stimulation period T is<br>
calculated as the reciprocal of the starting value of<br>
the frequency.<br>
7.1.2	Time delays<br>
The time delays of the stimulation signals are<br>
preferably determined after a first determination of<br>
the stimulation frequency or of the stimulation period<br>
T, respectively. The time delays are preferably<br>
selected as fractions of the stimulation period T, e.g.<br>
T/2. Preferably, time delays can also be selected which<br>
correspond to a multiple of fractions of the<br>
stimulation period T and possibly exceed the<br>
stimulation period T. The adaptation of the time delays<br>
described in section 7.2.2 also works in the case<br>
described above in which at least some of the time<br>
delays of the feedback stimulation signals from which<br>
the stimulation stimuli are generated are different<br>
and/or exceed the stimulation period T.<br>
7.1.3	Intensity<br>
The starting values of the stimulation parameters which<br>
determine the intensity of the stimulation stimulus<br>
(e.g. amplification of the feedback stimulation signal)<br>
are determined in accordance with the experimental<br>
values known to the expert (e.g. maximum amplitude<br>
10 V). The control of the intensity<br><br>
described at 7.2.3 also works if a starting value is<br>
used which greatly differs from the most advantageous<br>
intensity value. Differs greatly means that the value<br>
can also be too large by at least a factor of 10<br>
(preferably maximum amplitude 10 V) or too small. As an<br>
alternative, it is thus also possible to preferably<br>
begin with an intensity value which lies within the<br>
range known to the expert. In particular, it is<br>
preferred to begin a stimulation with small values of<br>
intensity, for example .maximum amplitude of 0.5V, of<br>
the stimulation signal in order to thus possibly reduce<br>
the side effects of the stimulation. If there is a<br>
necessity to use a stronger stimulation signal, the<br>
intensity can be increased in small steps as described<br>
in section 7.2.3.<br>
The starting values for frequency and intensity can<br>
thus be predetermined and, in particular, do not need<br>
to be determined as part of a time consuming<br>
calibration.<br>
7.2 Adaptation of the stimulation parameters<br>
7.2.1 Adaptation of the stimulation period T<br>
In the area to be decoupled and/or in the driving area<br>
and/or an area functionally closely connected thereto,<br>
the neural activity is measured which, after<br>
processing, is used as stimulation signal. For example,<br>
in Parkinson's disease, apart from a measurement via<br>
the sensors 3 directly in the area to be decoupled<br>
and/or in the driving area, the activity can also be<br>
measured in a following area, e.g. the premotor cortex<br>
via epicortical sensors. In a time window with a length<br>
specified below, the dominant mean period is<br>
determined. For this purpose, different algorithms can<br>
be used. For example,- the stimulation period T can be<br>
adapted<br><br>
to the instantaneous period of the neuron population to<br>
be decoupled and/or the driving neuron population. For<br>
example, the instantaneous period can be determined as<br>
the time difference between two successive maxima of<br>
the measured neural activity. As well, for example, the<br>
mean frequency of the neural activity can be estimated<br>
first and the stimulation period T can be determined as<br>
reciprocal of the mean frequency. If not only disease-<br>
specific activity is measured via the sensor 3, the<br>
disease-specific activity must first be extracted via<br>
band-pass filtering of the frequency range specific to<br>
the disease for this type of frequency estimation. As<br>
an alternative, for example, the frequency can be<br>
determined via the frequency estimators mentioned in<br>
section 6.3. The time window used for this frequency<br>
estimation has a length which can be open towards upper<br>
values and corresponds to, for example 10000 periods,<br>
preferably 1000 periods, particularly preferably 100<br>
periods of the pathological activity, but also to other<br>
arbitrary values.<br>
7.2.2 Adaptation of the time delays<br>
As described in sections 3.4 and 7.1.2, the time delays<br>
of the stimulation signals are preferably selected as<br>
fractions of the stimulation period T. During the<br>
stimulation, the time delays can be fixed, for example,<br>
or preferably adapted to the stimulation period adapted<br>
in accordance with section 7.2.1. To be able to achieve<br>
an optimum decoupling and/or desynchronization with<br>
little resultant stimulation influence, the time delays<br>
of the stimulation signals are varied preferably during<br>
the stimulation by a deterministic or stochastic and/or<br>
combined stochastic/deterministic algorithm. For this<br>
purpose, the device according to the invention<br>
comprises means in the form of the control unit 4 which<br>
allow the time delays of the<br><br>
stimulation signals to be varied during the<br>
stimulation. Furthermore, the time delays . can be<br>
varied, for example, not only within a stimulation<br>
period, but also as part of a number of. periods. In<br>
this case, the stimulation signal corresponds to the<br>
neural activity which has been measured at a time<br>
earlier by a few periods.<br>
7.2.3 Adaptation of the intensity<br>
The neural activity which represents the activity of<br>
the neuron population to be decoupled and/or of the<br>
driving neuron population is measured by a sensor 3.<br>
This neural activity is forwarded to unit 4 for signal<br>
processing and/or control. The unit 4 for signal<br>
processing and/or control performs a permanent or<br>
repetitive or demand-controlled stimulation according<br>
to section 6, wherein the intensity of the stimulation<br>
stimulus applied at the respective time depends on the<br>
instance of the pathological feature in the neural<br>
activity. For this purpose, the intensity of the<br>
stimulation stimulus can be preferably adapted. In this<br>
embodiment, the device comprises a control system which<br>
is programmed in such a manner that it varies the<br>
amplification of the measurement signals in accordance<br>
with section 3.3 for controlling the stimulus<br>
intensity. The relation between the stimulus intensity<br>
and instance of the pathological feature can be<br>
controlled either manually or automatically in<br>
dependence on the stimulation result. In a time window<br>
of freely selectable, preferably constant lengths which<br>
ends in a constant time interval before the respective<br>
stimulus, the instance of the pathological feature is<br>
determined in the following manner:<br>
a) In the case where exclusively or predominantly	the<br>
pathological activity to be decoupled and/or	the<br>
driving pathological activity is measured via	the<br>
sensor 3, the amplitude<br><br>
corresponds to the instance of the synchronization<br>
of the neuron population to be decoupled. The<br>
amplitude thus represents the pathological feature.<br>
The amplitude can then be estimated via the<br>
determination of the maximum of the signal or via<br>
the mean value of the amount of the signal or with<br>
band-pass filtering and/or with Hilbert<br>
transformation and/or wavelet analysis. The first<br>
two variants (determination of the maximum of the<br>
signal or determination of the mean value of the<br>
amount of the signal) are used especially preferably<br>
since the calculation of the amplitude by means of<br>
Hilbert transformation and/or wavelet analysis means<br>
a distinctly higher computational effort and their<br>
accuracy depends on the correct selection of<br>
algorithmic parameters,<br>
b) If, in addition to the disease-specific activity,<br>
non-disease-specific activity, for example from<br>
other neuron populations, is measured via the sensor<br>
3, the neural activity cannot be applied directly<br>
for estimating the instance of • the pathological<br>
feature. Since the disease-specific activity occurs<br>
typically in a frequency range which differs from<br>
the frequency range of the non-disease-specific<br>
activity, the activity is preferably estimated in<br>
the disease-specific frequency range in this case.<br>
This is implemented, for example, by a frequency<br>
analysis. For example, the spectral energy in the<br>
disease-specific frequency range can be determined.<br>
As an alternative, after band-pass filtering, the<br>
amplitude can be determined by determining the<br>
maximum of the band-pass filtered signal or by<br>
determining the mean value of the amount of<br><br>
the signal and/or with Hilbert transformation and/or<br>
with wavelet analysis.<br>
If the desired effect is not achieved, that is to say<br>
if the population to be decoupled is not adequately<br>
decoupled and thus the pathological feature of the<br>
neural activity is not shifted below the threshold<br>
value, the maximum intensity of the stimulus is slowly<br>
increased up to a maximum value rigidly predetermined<br>
for safety reasons, for example 5 V (e.g. in steps of<br>
0.5 V per 50 periods) . For this purpose, the device<br>
according to the invention has a control system which<br>
detects a change in the neural activity and, when the<br>
change in the neural activity disappears, adapts the<br>
stimulating signals towards upper values. After approx.<br>
20 successful periods of stimulation, the device can<br>
begin to slowly correct the maximum intensity of the<br>
stimulus (e.g. in steps of 0.5 V per 50 periods) to<br>
lower values for as long as the stimulation result is<br>
still present. During this process, the stimulation<br>
result is determined as described above. The control<br>
system is programmed in such a manner that it detects<br>
the change in neural activity and thus the stimulation<br>
result. The maximum stimulus intensity is preferably<br>
controlled on a time scale between 10 and 1000 periods<br>
of the neural activity in such a manner that the neuron<br>
population to be decoupled is adequately decoupled and<br>
desynchronized.<br>
Independently of the value of the stimulation intensity<br>
defined above, the amplitude of the resultant<br>
stimulation influence on the neuron population to be<br>
decoupled is automatically minimized due to the<br>
characteristics, described in section 5, of the<br>
stimulation mechanism of the device according to the<br>
invention after successful decoupling.<br><br>
7.3 Stimulation parameters for the case where the<br>
electrode 2 is not located in the neuron<br>
population to. be decoupled<br>
As in the case described of an electrode 2 not located<br>
in the neuron population to be decoupled, the neuron<br>
population to be decoupled is influenced via an<br>
indirect stimulation as described in section 4.1. Since<br>
in the case of an indirect stimulation, the conduction<br>
times between the stimulated target population, on the<br>
one hand, and the population, to be decoupled, on the<br>
other hand, can be of different magnitude in each case,<br>
the respective conduction times are first measured<br>
before the decoupling stimulation is carried out. For<br>
this purpose, a stimulus is applied via the stimulation<br>
electrode 2 and the response to the stimulus is<br>
measured via the sensors 3 placed in the neuron<br>
population to be decoupled. This is carried out L-<br>
times, where L is typically a small integral number of<br>
up to, for example, 200. From this, the mean conduction<br>
time is preferably estimated in the following manner:<br>
The duration between the beginning of the application<br>
of the stimulus via the electrode 2 and the first<br>
maximum of the response to the stimulus or of the<br>
amount of the response to the stimulus x(k) is<br>
determined for each individual stimulus application. In<br>
x(k), the index k stands for the kth applied stimulus.<br>
From this, the mean duration between stimulus beginning<br>
and stimulus response is then determined separately for<br>
the stimulation electrode 2 via which the stimulation<br>
is indirectly applied, in accordance with the following<br>
formula 1:<br><br>
where L is the number of the stimuli applied via the<br>
stimulation electrode 2.<br><br>
For the stimulation, the conduction time f determined<br>
in this manner is taken into consideration in the<br>
following manner:<br>
If, in the case of direct stimulation of the neuron<br>
population to be decoupled, a stimulus would be applied<br>
with a time delay t via the stimulation electrode 2, in<br>
the case of indirect stimulation the stimulus is<br>
imparted with a time delay t-F via the stimulation<br>
electrode 2, where t must be greater than f which can<br>
be achieved in accordance with section 7.2.2.<br>
The determination of the stimulation parameters at the<br>
beginning of the stimulation, and the control<br>
mechanisms during the stimulation, are carried out<br>
completely analogously as described in sections 7.1 and<br>
7.2, taking into consideration the conduction times f<br>
as described above.<br>
8 Examples and other embodiments of the device<br>
8.1 Examples<br>
For example, the following stimulus can be delivered<br>
via the electrode:<br>
1.	Via the electrode, a stimulation stimulus is applied<br>
which consists of two components: the feedback<br>
stimulation signal, i.e. the processed neural<br>
activity, where the stimulation signal is offset in<br>
time by T/2, where T is the mean period of the<br>
oscillations of the neuron population to be<br>
decoupled. The non-time-delayed processed neural<br>
activity is added to this signal. Together, they<br>
form the stimulation stimulus, see figure 2.<br>
2.	Via the electrode, a signal is applied which<br>
consists of three components: the processed and non-<br>
time-delayed neural activity is • squared and<br>
multiplied by a neural activity time delayed by T/2<br>
and processed, where T is the period<br><br>
of the rhythm of the driving neuron population, see<br>
figure 3.<br>
The effect of the stimulation on the population to be<br>
decoupled becomes apparent in a reduction in the<br>
amplitude of the neural activity measured, see figure<br>
2a and 3a, where the firing pattern of the neurons<br>
distinctly differs from the firing pattern in the<br>
pathological state, see figure 2b and 3b. This<br>
stimulation influence is also reflected in the extent<br>
of synchronization of the neuron population to be<br>
decoupled, see figure 2c and 3c which represents a<br>
confirmation that desynchronization of the population<br>
to be decoupled is occurring. In this process, the<br>
amplitude of the resultant stimulation influence, i.e.<br>
of the sum of coupling and stimulation, is<br>
automatically reduced and minimized due to the self-<br>
regulating demand control of the stimulation signal,<br>
described in section 5, see figure 2d and 3d.<br>
Furthermore, there is no influence on the inherent<br>
dynamics of the neurons during the stimulation which<br>
confirms that the inherent frequencies of the neuron<br>
population are distributed in figure 2e and 3e.<br>
Inherent frequencies are understood to be the<br>
frequencies of the neurons in the state without<br>
interaction and without stimulation. This confirms that<br>
optimum decoupling and desynchronization of the neuron<br>
population to be decoupled has occurred due to the<br>
stimulation according to the invention and the<br>
population has thus returned into its normal functional<br>
state which allows a considerable reduction in the<br>
disease-related symptoms to be expected.<br>
For example, three different control mechanisms of the<br>
stimulus application, described in section 6, are used<br>
for stimulating by means of which preferably a demand-<br>
controlled, and thus energy-saving and mild stimulation<br>
(avoiding side effects) is made possible as described<br>
in section 7:<br><br>
1.	Permanent stimulus application: stimulation is<br>
applied permanently, preferably with adaptation of<br>
the stimulation period. Directly after application<br>
of the stimulation, decoupling and desynchronization<br>
of the neuron population to be decoupled occurs.<br>
This minimizes the amplitude of the neural activity<br>
measured. At the same time, the amplitude of the<br>
resultant influence of stimulation on the population<br>
to be decoupled is minimized due to the mechanism of<br>
self-regulating demand control described in section<br>
5. After the stimulation has been switched off, a<br>
resynchronization may occur after a short time due<br>
to the pathological interaction between . the<br>
populations.<br>
2.	Repetitive stimulus application, preferably with<br>
demand-controlled stimulus intensity: stimulation is<br>
applied repeatedly. In this process, the intensity<br>
of the stimuli is adapted to the intensity of the<br>
synchronization of the neuron population: the<br>
stronger the coupling and/or synchronization, the<br>
stronger the coordinated stimulus will be.<br>
In this variant, x/2 can be preferably selected<br>
instead of T/2 as time delay, where T is the period<br>
of the rhythm without stimulation and x is the<br>
period enforced on the rhythm by stimulation. In<br>
other words: 1/x is the frequency of the stimulation<br>
signal with which the individual stimuli are<br>
applied. As a result, the only critical stimulation<br>
parameter is forced onto the system: instead of<br>
determining this parameter in a suitable manner as<br>
part of an elaborate calibration, it is dictated by<br>
the stimulation. In addition, this form of demand-<br>
controlled stimulation makes use of the<br>
circumstances that the neurons in the affected areas<br>
have a (pathological) tendency<br><br>
for periodically firing or bursting (rhythmic<br>
production of bursts of action potentials). For this<br>
reason, an entrainment of the neural activity of the<br>
neuron population to be decoupled can be achieved<br>
with respect to the enforced frequency.<br>
3. Demand-controlled stimulus application (i.e. demand-<br>
controlled choice of starting and end times of the<br>
stimulation) of the stimulation stimulus: if the<br>
synchronization of the nerve cell population exceeds<br>
a threshold, value, the next stimulus is delivered<br>
via the electrode as described in section 6.3.<br>
In all three control methods described by way of<br>
example above, a self-regulating demand control,<br>
described in section 5, necessitates minimization of<br>
the energy input into the population to be decoupled.<br>
In this process, the only important stimulation<br>
parameters, the stimulation period T and thus the time<br>
delays, can be preferably adapted by measuring the<br>
frequency of the nerve cell population in the neuron<br>
population to be decoupled and/or the driving neuron<br>
population or another nerve cell population closely<br>
connected thereto.<br>
The possibility exists of combining a number of<br>
stimulation electrodes in one stimulation electrode to<br>
be implanted, e.g. by positioning the stimulation<br>
contacts at different distances from the end of the<br>
electrode. This makes it possible to achieve a<br>
stimulation of the area to be decoupled which is as<br>
comprehensive as possible.<br>
8.2 Other embodiments of the device<br>
The device according to the invention can also be used<br>
for desynchronizing a pathologically synchronous neuron<br>
population. In this embodiment of the<br><br>
device according to the invention, a pathologically<br>
synchronous neuron population, e.c . the driving neuron<br>
population to be desynchronized, is desynchronized by<br>
means of stimulation with the feedback stimulation<br>
signal according to the invention,. The characteristics<br>
of the device described above and the stimulation<br>
methods for decoupling the neuron population to be<br>
decoupled also apply to this embcdiment of the device<br>
with the modification that the stimulation is applied<br>
in the neuron population to' be desynchronized.<br>
If the aim is desynchronization, this can be achieved<br>
by means of an arrangement of the stimulation electrode<br>
2 according to section 4.1. A direct and indirect<br>
arrangement of the sensors 3 is also possible. In this<br>
case, the sensors 3 must be arranged in such a manner<br>
that a detection of the neural activity of the area to<br>
be desynchronized is possible. The details of this<br>
arrangement correspond to the details described in<br>
section 4.2 wherein the activity to be desynchronized<br>
is now measured. The pathologically synchronous<br>
activity of the neuron population to be desynchronized<br>
is measured directly and/or indirectly and processed<br>
according to section 3. This generates a stimulation<br>
signal which is used as basis for the stimulation<br>
stimuli. The stimulation stimuli generated are applied<br>
to the area to be desynchronized by means of a<br>
stimulation electrode so that direct or indirect<br>
stimulation of the population to be desynchronized<br>
occurs according to section 3 and 4.1 and the driving<br>
population is desynchronized according to the invention<br>
and the pathological symptoms are suppressed. If<br>
present, the driving coupling to the driven neuron<br>
population is' also decoupled automatically due to the<br>
desynchronization of the driving population, i.e. due<br>
to the<br><br>
desynchronization of the driving neuron population, the<br>
pathological drive of the driven neuron population<br>
disappears. Due to the relationship of the stimulation<br>
signal with the neural activity of the neuron<br>
population to be desynchronized, the amplitude of the<br>
resultant influence of the stimulation on the<br>
population to be desynchronized, i.e. the amplitude of<br>
the stimulation signal in the present case (see section<br>
2), is automatically minimized as described in<br>
section 5.<br>
The arrangement of the electrode and sensors adapted to<br>
the aim of the stimulation according to section 4, all<br>
three control methods of .controlling the stimulus<br>
application according to section 6, and the calibration<br>
and adaptation of the parameters according to section 7<br>
can also be used for the embodiment of the device<br>
according to the invention described.<br>
The device can also be used for decoupling a neuron<br>
population which is driven by a non-synchronous<br>
pathological neuron population. Furthermore, the device<br>
can be used for decoupling a population which is driven<br>
by a pathological activity and itself exhibits a non-<br>
pathological synchronous activity in the decoupled<br>
case. In this case, the arrangement of the electrode<br>
and sensors are identical with the arrangements<br>
described in section 4. The detection and processing of<br>
the neural activity is also effected in accordance with<br>
section 3.<br>
Furthermore, the device can be used for eliminating or<br>
suppressing the coupling of a non-pathological area.<br>
This could be used, e.g. in the examination of the<br>
interaction of neuron populations. The detection and<br>
processing of the neural activity and<br><br>
the arrangement of the electrode and sensors occurs<br>
here in accordance with sections 3 and 4.<br>
If, as mentioned in the introduction, a bilateral<br>
stimulation is necessary for decoupling the<br>
pathological activity, stimulation is preferably<br>
applied bilaterally with two individual devices or with<br>
one device according' to the invention designed for this<br>
purpose which can forward signals to at least two<br>
stimulation electrodes.<br><br>
9 Advantages<br>
The device according to the invention has a number of<br>
advantages in comparison with existing devices, e.g.<br>
DE 103 18 071.0-33 "Device for desynchronizing neural<br>
brain activity":<br>
1.	The main advantage of the device according to the<br>
invention consists in that a physiological stimulus,<br>
namely the feedback stimulation signal, that is to<br>
say the measured and processed neural activity of<br>
the neuron population to be decoupled and/or of the<br>
neuron population to be desynchronized is used for<br>
the stimulation. As a result, the self-regulating<br>
demand control of the stimulation signal, described<br>
in section 5, occurs which minimizes the energy<br>
input into the neuron population to be.decoupled or<br>
into the neuron population to be desynchronized and<br>
leads to slight side effects.<br>
2.	Due to the self-regulating stimulation signals<br>
according to section 5, the operation of the device<br>
according to the invention saves energy since both<br>
an energy-saving signal is used for the stimulation<br>
due to the demand-controlled stimulation signals and<br>
energy saving can be expected in the control devices<br>
according to the invention necessary for the<br>
stimulation control. As a result, the intervals<br>
between the necessary battery changes which are<br>
exhausting for the patient can be longer..<br>
3.	The embodiment of repetitive or permanent<br>
application with demand-controlled stimulus<br>
intensity is particularly advantageous since no<br>
threshold needs to be detected in this method. As a<br>
result, this embodiment can be implemented by means<br>
of much more simple algorithms. Correspondingly,<br>
their<br><br>
software or hardware implementation is much less<br>
complex.<br>
4 . In the case of permanent and repetitive stimulation<br>
with demand-controlled stimulus intensity and direct<br>
stimulation of the neuron population to be decoupled<br>
or of the neuron population to be desynchronized, no<br>
calibration is necessary, i.e. it is not necessary<br>
to perform a series of test stimuli in which the<br>
stimulation parameters are systematically varied,<br>
which leads to a reduced duration of the<br>
calibration.<br>
5.	Of great advantage overall is the general tolerance<br>
and ruggedness of the device according to the<br>
invention compared with the estimation of the<br>
parameters such as intensity, stimulation period and<br>
time delays.<br>
6.	By using only one electrode, the operative<br>
complexity, and thus the risk of complication during<br>
the operation, is considerably reduced for the<br>
patient. As a result, the device according to the<br>
invention provides a much gentler stimulus<br>
application.<br>
7.	Since the area to be decoupled is preferably located<br>
close to the surface of the brain, e.g. in the motor<br>
cortex, the access to the areas to be stimulated is<br>
much easier and with less risk, e.g. without depth<br>
implementation of the stimulation electrode.<br>
8.	The device can also be used for decoupling, non-<br>
pathological activity and thus provides a novel and<br>
important possibility for examining the interaction<br>
of neural populations in the brain.<br>
The lack of time-consuming calibration and the<br>
stability of the effect even with relatively great<br>
frequency fluctuations - particularly in method 1 of<br>
controlling the stimulus application<br><br>
(permanent stimulation, see section 6.1) - has<br>
important consequences.<br>
1.	The stimulation result can be checked immediately<br>
even intraoperatively during replacement of the<br>
electrode. As a result, the finding of the suitable<br>
target points can be clearly improved. The previous<br>
demand-controlled methods need calibration which<br>
lasts longer than 30 minutes per electrode. This<br>
cannot be carried out intraoperatively and cannot be<br>
expected of the patient (who is not anesthetized).<br>
2.	The new stimulation methods can also be used in<br>
neurological or psychiatric diseases in which the<br>
pathological rhythms have greatly fluctuating<br>
frequencies. In particular, the new methods can also<br>
be . used for decoupling rhythms occurring<br>
intermittently (i.e. for short periods). The result<br>
is that the new stimulation methods can be used in<br>
far more diseases, especially also in the case of<br>
epilepsies.<br>
Using the device according to the invention, the<br>
following diseases or symptoms can be treated with the<br>
new stimulation method by decoupling suitable brain<br>
areas.<br>
In all neurological or psychiatric diseases in which<br>
pathological neural synchronization plays a role<br>
relevant for the instance of the disease-specific<br>
symptoms, for example: Parkinson's disease, essential<br>
tremor, dystonia, compulsive diseases, tremor in<br>
multiple sclerosis, tremor as a consequence of a stroke<br>
or other tissue damage, for example tumorous tissue<br>
damage, for example in the area of the thalamus and/or<br>
of the basal ganglia, choreoathetosis and epilepsy,<br>
this enumeration not being intended to be restrictive.<br><br>
In the standard method currently used, continuous high-<br>
frequency stimulation, the following target areas are<br>
used, for example:<br>
Nucleus subthalamicus in the case of Parkinson's<br>
disease or the thalamus in the case of tremor-dominant<br>
Parkinson's disease, for example the nucleus ventralis<br>
intermedius thalami.<br>
In the case of essential tremor, the thalamus, for<br>
example the nucleus ventralis intermedius thalami.<br>
In the case of dystonia and choreoathetosis, the globus<br>
pallidum internum, in the case of epilepsy, the nucleus<br>
subthalamicus, the cerebellum, thalamic core regions,<br>
for example the nucleus ventralis intermedius thalami,<br>
or the nucleus caudatus.<br>
In the case of compulsive diseases, the capsula interna<br>
or the nucleus accumbens.<br>
In the device according to the invention, for example,<br>
the target areas listed above for the respective<br>
diseases and/or areas coupled thereto can be selected.<br>
Because the device according to the invention either<br>
does not need calibration or the calibration can be<br>
carried out very rapidly, the possibility exists to<br>
test as part of the electrode implantation alternative<br>
target areas in which the decoupling effect and/or the<br>
desynchronizing effect of the device according to the<br>
invention can be developed even better.<br>
The invention also comprises a control system which<br>
controls the operation of the device according to the<br>
invention as specified, and the use of the device and<br>
of the control system for treating the diseases<br>
Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, dystonia,<br>
compulsive diseases, choreoathetosis, tremor in<br>
multiple sclerosis, tremor as a consequence of a stroke<br>
or of other tissue damage, for example tumorous tissue<br>
damage, for example in the area of the thalamus and/or<br>
of the basal ganglia, and epilepsy.<br><br>
The device according to the invention can be used both<br>
as implant for permanent therapy of the above-mentioned<br>
neurological and psychiatric diseases and for<br>
intraoperative target diagnostics, i.e.<br>
intraoperatively finding the optimum target point for<br>
the electrode implantation.<br><br>
We claim:<br>
1. A device for decoupling and/or desynchronizing neural brain activity, comprising:<br>
at least one sensor (3) for measuring at least one signal which reproduces the<br>
development in time of activity of a neuron population to be decoupled and/or of a<br>
neuron population to be desynchronized;<br>
one electrode (2) with at least one electrode surface; and<br>
a control system (4) comprising an input to receive the measurement signals of the<br>
sensor, a processor to process the measurement signals, and an output to feed the<br>
processed measurement signals as stimulation signals into the electrode in order to<br>
decouple and/or to desynchronize the neuron population, the processing of the<br>
measurement signals consisting of one or more of band-pass filtering the measurement<br>
signals to generate stimulation signals which are band-pass filtered with respect to the<br>
measurement signals, delaying the measurement signals to generate stimulation signals<br>
which are time delayed with respect to the measurement signals, amplifying the<br>
measurement signals to generate stimulation signals which are amplified with respect<br>
to the measurement signals, and changing the polarity of the measurement signals to<br>
generate stimulation signals having a polarity opposite to the measurement signals.<br><br><br><br>
