A PROCESS OF PREPARING IMATINIB AND IMATINIB PREPARED THEREBY<br>
The present invention is concerned with a process of preparing imatinib, either as the free base or as acid addition salts thereof, and also such imatinib free base and imatinib acid addition salts prepared by the process of the present invention.<br>
Imatinib is the international non-proprietary name for N-{5-[4-(4-methyl piperazine methyl)-benzoylamido]-2-methylphenyl}-4-(3-pyridyl)-2-pyrimidine amine.<br>
EP 0564409 describes the preparation of imatinib and the use thereof, especially as an anti-tumour agent In particular, Example 21 describes the preparation of imatinib free base. There is no specific preparation of an imatinib salt in EP 0564409.<br>
The synthesis of imatinib mesylate is described in WO 99/03854. WO 99/03854 describes preparation of imatinib mesylate from imatinib free base, the preparation of the latter being referred to above mentioned EP 0564409.<br>
The prior art synthesis of imatinib in EP 0564409 involves reduction of (2-methyl-5-mtiophenyl)-6-pyridin-3-yl-l,6-dihydro-pyrimidme-2-yl)-amine of formula (TV) to yield N-(2-memyl-5-ammophenyl-4-(3-pyridyl)-2-pyiinudine amine of formula (II), followed by amidation involving N-(2-memyl-5-ammophenyl-4-(3-pyridyl)-2-pyrimidine amine of formula (II) with 4-(4-methyl-piperazino methyl)benzoyl chloride of formula (IIIa). In the prior art processes described in EP 0564409, the reduction reaction is usually carried out in presence of palladium catalyst under hydrogenation conditions. The condensation is carried out in presence of a base, such as pyridine, triemylamine or the like. The benzoyl chloride of formula (IIIa) is usually obtained as the dihydrochloride and used as such for the amidation step, and further an equivalent of hydrochloric acid is released during the reaction of N-(2-memyl-5-aminophenyl-4-(3-pyridyl)-2-pyrimidine amine of formula (H) with the benzoyl<br>
chloride of formula (IlIa). Hence, a person skilled in the art would be expected to use a base<br>
as a scavenger for the acid released during the reaction and also to neutralize the benzoyl<br><br>
WO 2004/074502<br><br>
PCT/GB2004/000018<br><br>
3<br>
chloride of formula (IIIA) prior to reaction with N-(2-methyl-5-aminophenyl-4-(3-pyridyl)-2-pyrimidine amine of formula (II).<br>
We have found the above reaction as described in the above mentioned prior art to be unsatisfactory, whereby the reduction by hydrogenation involved large volumes of solvent, took long hours and gave a low yield (40 - 45%). The condensation reaction was also slow, gave rise to undesirable side products, and involved tedious work-up procedures. Use of a solvent such as pyridine in the last step was found to be undesirable, since it was difficult to remove residual traces thereof from the final product. Due to the additional purification steps required for removal of impurities in the process, the yield of the product was found to be low.<br>
We have,-now found a surprisingly simple process for the preparation of imatinib, which process provides an improved reduction step of (2-methyl-5-nitrophenyl)-6^pyridin-3-yl-l,6-dmydro-pyrirrddine-2-yl)-amine of formula (IV) to N-(2-methyl-5-aminophenyl-4-(3-pyridyl)-2-pyrirnidine amine of formula (II) and an improved amidation step of N-(2-methyl-5-arnmophenyl-4-(3-pyridyl)-2-pyrimidine amine of formula (II) with a benzoyl halide of formula (III), which preparation overcomes the problems associated with the prior art method.<br>
There is provided by the present invention, therefore, a process of preparing imatinib, either as the free base or as an acid addition salt, which process comprises reacting N-(2-methyl-5-aminophenyl-4-(3-pyridyl)-2-pyrimidine amine of formula (II) with a 4-(4-methyI-piperazino methyl)benzoyl halide of formula (III)<br><br><br>
in the presence of an inert organic solvent, so as to yield a hydrohalide salt of imatinib of formula (I) where n represents 1, 2 or 3 and Hal represents bromo, chloro fluoro or iodo (in particular bromo or chloro, and especially chloro), either in anhydrous or hydrated form (in particular a hydrobromide or hydrochloride, and especially a hydrochloride), which can as desired optionally be further converted either to the free base or a further acid addition salt A specific hydrochloride salt of imatinib of formula (I) prepared according to the present invention is imatinib trihydrochloride monohydrate.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, therefore, there is provided a process of preparing imatinib, either as the free base or as an acid addition salt, which process comprises reacting N-(2-methyl-5-ammophenyl-4-(3-pyridyl)-2-pyrimidine amine of formula (II) with 4-(4-methyl-piperazino methyl)benzoyl chloride of formula (IIIa)<br><br><br>
in the presence of an inert organic solvent, so as to yield an imatinib hydrohalide salt which is a hydrochloride salt of imatinib of formula (la) where n represents 1, 2 or 3, either in anhydrous or hydrated form, which can as desired optionally be further converted either to the free base or a further acid addition salt. A specific hydrochloride salt of imatinib of formula (la) prepared according to the present invention is imatinib trihydrochloride monohydrate.<br>
There is also provided by the present invention a hydrohalide salt of imatinib of formula (I) either in anhydrous or hydrated form<br><br>

Suitably a hydrohalide salt of imatinib of formula (I), in particular a hydrobromide or hydrochloride salt of imatinib, and especially a hydrochloride salt of imatinib of formula (la), substantially as hereinbefore described can be employed as an intermediate in the preparation of imatinib free base or a further acid addition salt of imatinib, such as imatinib mesylate substantially as hereinafter described in greater detail.<br>
By "inert organic solvent" is meant an organic solvent, which under the reaction conditions of a process according to the present invention, does not enter into any appreciable reaction with either the reactants or the products. A suitable inert organic solvent for use in a process according to the present invention can be selected from the group consisting of dimethylformamide, dimethyl acetamide, N-methyl pyrrolidone, sulfolane, diglyme dioxane, tetrahydrofuran and other inert organic solvents known in the art A particularly suitable inert organic solvent for use in the above process according to the present invention is dimethylformamide.<br>
It will be appreciated from the above that the above process step does not employ a scavenger base for the reaction as is taught by the prior art, but is carried out under mild conditions whereby very little by-products are produced in the reaction. The work-up of the above process step is very easy and the product is filtered from the reaction mass as a hydrohalide salt of formula (I). The isolation of imatinib as a hydrohalide salt is a method of purification of the product Furthermore, the above process is suitable for large-scale production and is economical to operate.<br>
In the case where a hydrohalide salt of imatinib of formula (I), especially a hydrochloride salt of imatinib of formula (la), is converted to imatinib free base employing a process according to the present invention, suitably the imatinib hydrohalide salt of formula (I) can be treated with a suitable base so as to yield imatinib free base. A process according to the present invention may further comprise converting a hydrohalide salt of imatinib of formula (I), especially a hydrochloride salt of imatinib of formula (la), to a further acid addition salt of imatinib suitably by treatment of imatinib free base prepared as above, with an appropriate amount of an acid. Preferably methane sulphonic acid is employed so as to yield imatinib mesylate by a process according to the present invention.<br><br>

ABSTRACT<br>
A process of preparing imatinib, either as the free base or as an acid addition salt, which process comprises reacting N-(2-methyl-5-aminophenyl-4-(3-pyridyl)-2-pyrimidine amine of formula (II) with a 4-(4-methyl-piperazino methyl) benzoyl halide of formula (III) in the presence of an inert organic solvent, so as to yield a hydrohalide salt of imatini formula (I) where n represents 1, 2 or 3 and Hal represents bromo, chloro fluoro or iodo, either in anhydrous or hydrated form, which can as desired optionally be further conve either to the free base or a further acid addition salt. The present invention is also concerned with imatinib prepared according to the above process.<br></td>
