Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to the communication field, and in particular, to a<br>
charging test technology.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
With the diversification of communication services, the communication charging<br>
system, also named as Billing System (BS) is more and more complex to fulfill the<br>
flexible tariff policies and tariff packages and the compatibility between the tariff<br>
packages.<br>
Currently, the charging standards commonly applied by network operators include:<br>
time-based charging, traffic-based charging, and monthly flat rate.<br>
Time-based charging means that a switch which controls the call connection records<br>
the number of the calling party and the number of the called party, and the start time and<br>
the end time of the conversation to generate a bill; and the BS performs charging<br>
according to the time recorded in the bill. Traffic-based charging means that a network<br>
management system records the data traffic on a port, and uses the data traffic as a basis<br>
for charging. Monthly flat rate means that an operator charges a user a fixed monthly fee<br>
according to the provided services, and that the monthly fee varies with the type of the<br>
service activated for the user.<br>
In the existing communication network operation mode, if a new tariff needs to be<br>
added to the existing network, the correctness of the tariff of a new service is a top<br>
concern of the network operator. Therefore, it is essential to verify and test the correctness<br>
of the tariff of a new service.<br>
When the tariff of a new service is under test, the charging resources of the existing<br>
network need to be shared with the existing network subscribers, and it is difficult for the<br>
 <br>
BS to predict the correctness of the tariff of the new service. Therefore, from the<br>
perspective of the system security, the tariff of a new service is generally predicted<br>
through a set of standby devices or verification devices in addition to a set of dialing test<br>
devices. Specifically, the new service corresponding to the tariff is subscribed to on a<br>
standby device, and the tariff is validated in advance; and the dialing test device sends a<br>
charging request to verify whether the charging is correct on the standby device. After the<br>
verification succeeds, the new service and the corresponding tariff are imported into the<br>
existing network.<br>
The method for predicting the tariff of a new service in the prior art has at least the<br>
following defects: A set of standby devices and dialing test devices need to be configured<br>
and maintained, thus leading to high costs; in the prediction process, the tariff of the new<br>
service is validated in advance, or the time of the dialing test device is adjusted to<br>
implement the verification, thus making the time control inflexible in the verification; the<br>
standby devices and dialing test devices used in the prediction may differ from the actual<br>
BS in the network, and consequently, the prediction result is different from the result<br>
generated after the new service is launched in the existing network, and the charging is<br>
incorrect after the new service and the tariff are applied to the existing network.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
A charging test method and a charging device are provided in embodiments of the<br>
present invention so that a tariff rule to be validated in the future may be tested on the<br>
existing network device.<br>
A charging test method provided in an embodiment of the present invention includes:<br>
receiving a charging message; if a charged number in the received charging<br>
message is a test number, modifying the charging time in the charging message to be<br>
within the valid period of a tariff rule under test; and<br>
 <br>
using the tariff rule under test to perform charging for the charging message in<br>
which the charging time is modified.<br>
A charging device provided in an embodiment of the present invention includes:<br>
a receiving unit, adapted to receive a charging message;<br>
a judging unit, adapted to judge whether a charged number in the charging<br>
message received by the receiving unit is a test number;<br>
a modifying unit, adapted to modify the charging time in the charging message<br>
to be within the valid period of a tariff rule under test if the judging unit determines<br>
that the charged number is a test number; and<br>
a charging unit, adapted to use the tariff rule under test to perform charging for<br>
the charging message modified by the modifying unit.<br>
Compared with the prior art, the embodiments of the present invention bring the<br>
following benefits:<br>
After a charging message is received, if the charged number in the received charging<br>
message is a test number, the charging time in the charging message is modified to be<br>
within the valid period of the tariff rule under test, namely, modified to a virtual time; the<br>
existing network device automatically locates the tariff rule under test according to the<br>
virtual time, and uses the tariff rule under test to perform charging for the message.<br>
Therefore, it is not necessary to maintain a set of standby test devices for testing the tariff<br>
rule which will be validated in the future, and the costs of purchasing and maintaining the<br>
devices are reduced. Moreover, because the test is performed on the existing network<br>
device directly, smooth transition of the tariff rule is achieved. The implementation of the<br>
test mode is convenient and flexible because the test mode does not need to validate the<br>
tariff rule under test in advance or adjust the time of the dialing test device.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
To make the technical solution, objectives and merits of the present invention clearer,<br>
the following describes the embodiments of the present invention in detail with reference<br>
to accompanying drawings.<br>
As shown in FIG 1, a charging test method is provided in an embodiment of the<br>
present invention. In this embodiment, the correspondence between the tariff rule under<br>
test and the valid period of the tariff rule is stored beforehand.<br>
In step 101, the BS receives a charging message which carries a charged number and<br>
charging time.<br>
In step 102, the BS judges whether the charged number in the received charging<br>
message is a test number; if such is not the case, the process is ended; and, if such is the<br>
case, the process proceeds to step 103. For example, a test number set may be configured<br>
in the BS beforehand. If the charged number in the received charging message is included<br>
in the test number set, it is determined that the charged number is a test number, and the<br>
process proceeds to step 103.<br>
In step 103, the BS modifies the charging time in the charging message to be within<br>
the valid period of the tariff rule under test.<br>
In step 104, the tariff rule under test is used to perform charging for the charging<br>
message in which the charging time is modified. The charging time in the charging<br>
 <br>
message is modified to a virtual time. The existing network device can automatically<br>
locate the tariff rule under test according to the virtual time, and use the tariff rule under<br>
test to perform charging for the message. Therefore, it is not necessary to maintain a set of<br>
standby test devices for testing the tariff rule which will be validated in the future, and the<br>
costs of purchasing and maintaining the devices are reduced. Moreover, because the test is<br>
performed on the existing network device directly, smooth transition of the tariff rule is<br>
achieved. The implementation of the test mode is convenient and flexible because the test<br>
mode does not need to validate the tariff rule under test in advance or adjust the time of<br>
the dialing test device. Moreover, this test is implemented in a real network environment<br>
in the prior art, and the real time scenario is simulated through setting of virtual time, thus<br>
bringing a vivid test effect and high accuracy.<br>
A charging test method is provided in another embodiment of the present invention.<br>
In this embodiment, the correspondence between the tariff rule under test and the valid<br>
period of the tariff rule needs to be stored beforehand. A test number set is configured in<br>
the BS of the existing network. The corresponding test time is configured for each test<br>
number in the test number set. The test time falls within the valid period of the tariff rule<br>
under test; that is, the test time is a virtual time. In this way, it is practicable to test whether<br>
the charging based on the tariff rule is accurate at different time in the future, and the<br>
covered time range is wider, and the test accuracy is higher. FIG. 2 shows a flowchart of<br>
the charging test method.<br>
In step 201, the BS receives a charging message. Each charging message carries the<br>
following information: charged number, origin charging start time, also named "Event<br>
Origin Start Time", and origin charging end time, also named "Event Origin End Time".<br>
The origin charging start time and the origin charging end time are collectively called<br>
"charging time in the charging message".<br>
In step 202, after receiving the charging message, the BS obtains the charged number<br>
from the message, and searches the test number set for the charged number carried in the<br>
 <br>
charging message. In this way, the BS judges whether the charged number is a test number.<br>
This judgment mode is very simple and convenient. If the charged number is found in the<br>
test number set, it indicates that the charged number is a test number, and the process<br>
proceeds to step 204; otherwise, the process goes to step 203, in which the charging is<br>
performed for the charging message according to the charging method of the existing<br>
network.<br>
In step 204, the BS judges whether the charging message is an "Initial" message. If<br>
such is the case, the process proceeds to step 205; otherwise, the process goes to step 206.<br>
Specifically, for a complete charging process, an "Initial" message needs to be sent to the<br>
BS at the beginning of the conversation; in the conversation process, an "Update" message<br>
may be sent to the BS periodically; and, at the end of the conversation, a "Terminate"<br>
message is sent to the BS. Therefore, the charging message received by the BS in step 204<br>
may be any of the foregoing three messages. In this step, it is necessary to judge the<br>
received message to facilitate the subsequent operations.<br>
In step 205: The charging message received by the BS is "Initial". In the<br>
preprocessing of the charging message, the BS modifies the origin charging start time of<br>
the charging message to the test time corresponding to the test number in the test number<br>
set, called virtual charging start time, also named "Event Charged Start Time". The BS<br>
calculates the difference between the origin charging start time prior to the modification<br>
and the virtual charging start time subsequent to the modification, and the difference is an<br>
test interval, also named "Event Test Interval". Afterward, the BS adds this difference to<br>
the origin charging end time to obtain the virtual charging end time, also named "Event<br>
Charged End Time". This time falls within the valid period of the tariff rule under test.<br>
Because different test time is configured in the test number set, the charging time in the<br>
charging message may be modified to different time within the valid period of the tariff<br>
rule under test, and the time control for the charging message is more flexible, and the test<br>
for the tariff rule is more comprehensive.<br>
 <br>
If the charging message is not "Initial" but another message subsequent to the<br>
"Initial" message, for example, "Update" and/or "Terminate", the process proceeds to step<br>
206.<br>
In step 206, in the process of preprocessing the charging message, the charging time<br>
in the charging message is modified to be within the valid period of the tariff rule under<br>
test, namely, modified to the virtual time, according to the difference calculated in step<br>
205.<br>
Specifically, the foregoing difference is added to the origin charging start time and<br>
the origin charging end time of the charging message to obtain the virtual charging start<br>
time and the virtual charging end time of the charging message. This mode simulates the<br>
time of receiving the charging message in a future conversation more vividly, and brings a<br>
more accurate test effect.<br>
In step 207, the BS may calculate out the charging duration according to the virtual<br>
charging start time and the virtual charging end time of the charging message calculated in<br>
step 205 or step 206, search out the tariff rule under test from the correspondence<br>
according to the modified virtual charging start time, and performs charging for the<br>
charging message in this test according to the tariff rule under test and the charging<br>
duration. This test is implemented in a real network environment in the prior art, and the<br>
real time scenario is simulated through setting of virtual time, thus bringing a vivid test<br>
effect and high accuracy. Moreover, the existing network device automatically locates the<br>
tariff rule under test according to the virtual time, and uses the tariff rule under test to<br>
perform charging for the message. Therefore, it is not necessary to maintain a set of<br>
standby test devices for testing the tariff rule which will be validated in the future, and the<br>
costs of purchasing and maintaining the devices are reduced.<br>
In this embodiment, after the system finishes processing the "Initial" message,<br>
"Update" message and "Terminate" message sent by the existing dialing test device, the<br>
online verification of the tariff of the future product is completed.<br>
 <br>
A charging test method is provided in another embodiment of the present invention.<br>
This charging test method is similar to that shown in FIG. 2, and differs in that: In the<br>
embodiment shown in FIG 2, after receiving the "Initial" message, the BS calculates the<br>
difference between the origin charging start time prior to modification and the virtual<br>
charging start time subsequent to modification; after receiving the "Update" or<br>
"Terminate" message subsequently, the BS adds the difference to the origin charging start<br>
time and the origin charging end time of the two messages to obtain the virtual charging<br>
start time and the virtual charging end time. In this embodiment, however, the BS stores<br>
the virtual charging end time of the previous charging message; after receiving the next<br>
charging message, the BS uses the virtual charging end time of the previous charging<br>
message as the virtual charging start time of the next charging message directly, and<br>
calculates the difference between the virtual charging start time of the next message<br>
subsequent to modification and the origin charging start time prior to modification. The<br>
BS adds the difference to the origin charging end time of the charging message to obtain<br>
the virtual charging end time of the charging message. This BS repeats this process to<br>
obtain the virtual time of every charging message.<br>
Specifically, after receiving the "Initial" message, the BS modifies its origin charging<br>
start time and origin charging end time in the way illustrated in FIG. 2, and stores the<br>
virtual charging end time subsequent to the modification. After receiving the second<br>
charging message which may be an "Update" or "Terminate" message, the BS assigns the<br>
stored value to the virtual charging start time of the second charging message to ensure<br>
that the virtual charging start time of the second charging message is equal to the virtual<br>
charging end time of the first charging message. Moreover, the BS calculates the<br>
difference between the origin charging start time of the second charging message and the<br>
virtual charging start time subsequent to modification, and then adds the difference to the<br>
origin charging end time of the second charging message to obtain the virtual charging end<br>
time of the second charging message. In this way, the virtual charging end time is stored,<br>
 <br>
and is assigned to the virtual charging start time of the next charging message. This<br>
process is repeated. After the system finishes processing the "Initial" message, "Update"<br>
message and "Terminate" message sent by the existing dialing test device, the online<br>
verification of the tariff of the future product is completed.<br>
The charging test in the embodiments of the present invention is implemented<br>
through processing of the "Initial", "Update" and "Terminate" messages sent by the<br>
existing dialing test device. Evidently, the charging test is performed on the existing<br>
network device, and smooth transition of the tariff rule is achieved. The implementation of<br>
the test mode is convenient and flexible because the test mode does not need to validate<br>
the tariff rule under test in advance or adjust the time of the dialing test device.<br>
A charging device is provided in another embodiment of the present invention. As<br>
shown in FIG 3, the charging device includes a receiving unit 31, a judging unit 32, a<br>
modifying unit 33, and a charging unit 34. First, the receiving unit 31 receives a charging<br>
message. The judging unit 32 judges whether the charged number in the charging message<br>
received by the receiving unit 31 is a test number. If the judging unit 32 determines that<br>
the charged number in the received charging message is a test number, the modifying unit<br>
33 modifies the charging time in the charging message to be within the valid period of the<br>
tariff rule under test, namely, modifies the charging time to virtual time. Afterward, the<br>
charging device automatically locates the tariff rule under test according to the virtual time,<br>
and the charging unit 34 uses the tariff rule under test to perform charging for the charging<br>
message modified by the modifying unit 33. Therefore, it is not necessary to maintain a set<br>
of standby test devices for testing the tariff rule which will be validated in the future, and<br>
the costs of purchasing and maintaining the devices are reduced. Moreover, because the<br>
test is performed on the existing network device directly, smooth transition of the tariff<br>
rule is achieved. The implementation of the test mode is convenient and flexible because<br>
the test mode does not need to validate the tariff rule under test in advance or adjust the<br>
time of the dialing test device.<br>
 <br>
Moreover, the charging device further includes a storing unit 35 for storing the test<br>
number set and the test time corresponding to each test number in the test number set. The<br>
test time falls within the valid period of the tariff rule under test.<br>
Specifically, the judging unit 32 judges whether the charged number in the charging<br>
message received by the receiving unit 31 is a number in the test number set stored by the<br>
storing unit 35. If such is the case, the judging unit determines that the charged number is<br>
a test number; otherwise, the judging unit determines that the charged number is not a test<br>
number. After the judging unit 32 determines that the charged number is a number in the<br>
test number set, the judging unit instructs the modifying unit 33 to modify the charging<br>
time of the charging message according to the test time corresponding to the test number<br>
in the test number set.<br>
To sum up, in the embodiments of the present invention, after a charging message is<br>
received, if the charged number in the received charging message is a test number, the<br>
charging time in the charging message is modified to be within the valid period of the<br>
tariff rule under test, namely, modified to virtual time; the existing network device<br>
automatically locates the tariff rule under test according to the virtual time, and uses the<br>
tariff rule under test to perform charging for the message. Therefore, it is not necessary to<br>
maintain a set of standby test devices for testing the tariff rule which will be validated in<br>
the future, and the costs of purchasing and maintaining the devices are reduced. Moreover,<br>
because the test is performed on the existing network device directly, smooth transition of<br>
the tariff rule is achieved. The implementation of the test mode is convenient and flexible<br>
because the test mode does not need to validate the tariff rule under test in advance or<br>
adjust the time of the dialing test device.<br>
This test is implemented in a real network environment in the prior art, and the real<br>
time scenario is simulated through setting of virtual time, thus bringing a vivid test effect<br>
and high accuracy.<br>
 <br>
A test number set is set in the BS. If the charged number in the received charging<br>
message is included in the test number set, it is determined that the charged number is a<br>
test number. This mode is simple and convenient.<br>
Each test number in the set corresponds to different test time. The test time falls<br>
within the valid period of the tariff rule under test. In this way, it is practicable to test<br>
whether the charging based on the tariff rule is accurate at different time in the future, and<br>
the covered time range is wider, and the test accuracy is higher.<br>

within the valid period of a tariff rule under test in the process of preprocessing the<br>
charging message.<br>
8.	A charging device, characterized in comprising:<br>
a receiving unit, adapted to receive a charging message;<br>
a judging unit, adapted to judge whether a charged number in the charging message<br>
received by the receiving unit is a test number;<br>
a modifying unit, adapted to modify the charging time in the charging message to be<br>
within the valid period of a tariff rule under test if the judging unit determines that the<br>
charged number is a test number; and<br>
a charging unit, adapted to use the tariff rule under test to perform charging for the<br>
charging message modified by the modifying unit.<br>
9.	The charging device of claim 8, characterized in further comprising:<br>
a storing unit, adapted to store a test number set,<br>
wherein the judging unite is further adapted to judge whether the charged number in<br>
the charging message received by the receiving unit is a number in the test number set<br>
stored in the storing unit; if the charged number is in the test number set, the judging unit<br>
determines that the charged number is a test number; otherwise, the judging unit<br>
determines that the charged number is not a test number.<br>
10.	The charging device of claim 9, characterized in that, the storing unit is further<br>
adapted to store the test time corresponding to each test number in the test number set; the<br>
test time falls within the valid period of the tariff rule under test; and<br>
 <br>
the modifying unit is further adapted to modify the charging time of the charging<br>
message according to the test time corresponding to the test number in the test number set.<br>
 <br>
<br>
A charging test method and a charging device are provided. The charging test method<br>
includes: receiving a charging message; if a charged number in the received charging<br>
message is a test number, modifying the charging time in the charging message to be<br>
within the valid period of a tariff rule under test, namely, modifying the charging time to<br>
virtual time; and performing charging for the message through an existing network device<br>
according to the virtual time by using the tariff rule under test. The method further<br>
includes: configuring a test number set; if the charged number in the received charging<br>
message is included in the test number set, determining that the charged number is a test<br>
number. With the present invention, the tariff rule to be validated in the future is tested on<br>
the existing network device.<br>
