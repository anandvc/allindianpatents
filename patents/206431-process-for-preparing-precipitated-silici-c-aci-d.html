				<td>The present invention relates to precipitated silicic acids, a process for their preparation, and their use in rubber mixtures.<br>
It is known to incorporate precipitated silicic acids into rubber mixtures (see Wolff, Kautschuk, Gummi, Kunstst. 7 (1988) p.674).  Precipitated silicic acids have to be readily dispersible when used in rubber mixtures.  A poor dispersibility is often the reason why precipitated silicic acids are not used in tyre mixtures.<br>
Document WO 95/09128 discloses precipitated silicic acids that can be used in tyres.  Their use in tyre carcasses is however not mentioned.<br>
On account of the more stringent requirements of the tyre industry, even the improved dispersion of this precipitated silicic acid is no longer sufficient for use in tyre treads.<br>
WO 96/30304 describes a precipitated silicic acid that can be dispersed in tyre treads.<br>
Using the known precipitated silicic acid described in WO 96/30304 it is possible to achieve a reduction in the rolling resistance of the tyre by 20 - 30% compared to tyres filled with carbon black.  This corresponds to a saving in fuel of ca. 5%.<br>
Different tyre constituents contribute in various proportions to the rolling resistance of an automobile tyre:<br><br>
2<br><br>
Tread:	50%<br>
Belt:	20%<br>
Carcase:	10%<br>
Side wall:	10%<br>
Tyre bead:	5%<br>
Inner layer:	5%<br>
In a lorry tyre the proportion of the individual tyre segments to the rolling resistance differs from the distribution in an automobile tyre:<br><br>
Tread:	30%<br>
Belt:	20%<br>
Carcase:	24%<br>
Side wall:	10%<br>
Tyre bead:	16%<br>
This distribution of the proportions contributing to the rolling resistance shows that in automobile tyres 50% and in lorry tyres even up to 70% of the rolling resistance is due to structural parts of the tyre carcase.  Up to now carbon black has overwhelmingly been used as active filler in tyre carcasses.<br>
The invention relates to the development of precipitated silicic acids for use in tyre carcasses, with the aim of achieving a further considerable reduction in the rolling resistance.  The prerequisite for the use of precipitated silicic acids in tyre carcasses is their easy dispersibility.<br>
Some sections of the automobile industry demand that the rolling resistance be reduced by approximately a further<br>
10%.  Up to now it has not been possible to achieve this.<br><br>
3<br>
Lorry tyre customers are in addition asking for an increase in the service life of lorry tyres.  The use of precipitated silicic acids according to the invention is also meeting this request, combined with a reduction in the amount of heat generated.<br>
The present invention provides a precipitated silicic acid that is characterised by an A12O3 content of 0.2 to 5.0 wt.% and a wk coefficient of less than 3.4.<br>
The precipitated silicic acid according to the invention may have a BET surface of 80 to 180 m2/g.<br>
The precipitated silicic acid according to the invention may have a CTAB surface of 80 to 139 m2/g.<br>

which is characterised in that alkali silicate is reacted with mineral acids and aluminium sulfate solution at temperatures of 60 - 95Â°C at a pH of 7.0 - 11.0 while stirring continuously, the reaction is continued until a solids concentration of 40 g/1 - 110 g/1 is achieved, the pH is adjusted to a value between 3 and 5, and the precipitated silicic acid is filtered off, washed, then dried and optionally ground or granulated.<br><br>

In a particular modification the addition of water glass, aluminium sulfate solution and sulfuric acid may be discontinued for 30 - 90 minutes and then continued.<br>
In a preferred embodiment commercially available sodium water glass (modulus 3.2 - 3.5) may be reacted with sulfuric acid at a pH between 7.5 and 10.5, some of the sodium water glass being added beforehand to adjust the pH in the reaction vessel.  The addition of water glass and sulfuric acid is maintained over a period of up to 120 minutes, wherein in a particular modification the addition may be discontinued for 30 - 90 minutes, following which the reaction mixture may be acidified to pH 3 - 5, filtered, washed and dried.<br>
In order to achieve a particularly good dispersibility the simultaneous addition of sodium water glass and sulfuric acid preferably takes place over a period of between 40 and 90 minutes.  The surface of the silicic acid can be adjusted via the precipitation duration.<br>
Chamber filter presses or membrane filter presses or band filters or rotary filters or automatic membrane filter presses or two of the filters in combination may be used for the filtration.<br>

The silanes listed in Table 1 may preferably be used:<br><br>
Table 1<br>
Silane<br><br>
* limited availability<br><br>
10<br>
The modification with organosilanes may be carried out in mixtures of 0.5 to 50 parts, referred to 100 parts of precipitated silicic acid, in particular 2 to 15 parts, referred to 100 parts of precipitated silicic acid, wherein the reaction between the precipitated silicic acid and organosilane may be carried out during the preparation of the mixture (in situ) or outside (pre-modified) by spraying and then tempering the mixture, or by mixing the silane and the silicic acid suspension, followed by drying and tempering.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention<br>
bis(triethoxysilylpropyl) tetrasulfane (trade name Si 69 of<br>
Degussa AG) may be used as silane.<br>
The precipitated silicic acid according to the invention may be incorporated as reinforcing filler into vulcanisable rubber mixtures in amounts of 2 to 200 parts, referred to 100 parts of rubber, as powder, microbeads or granules, with or without silane modification.<br>
The addition of one or more of the aforementioned silanes to the rubber mixture may take place together with the silicic acids according to the invention, the reaction between the filler and silane occurring during the mixing process at elevated temperatures (in situ modification) or in an already pre-modified form (for example DE-PS 40 04 781) , in other words both reaction partners are reacted outside the actual preparation of the mixture.<br>
A further possibility is to modify the precipitated silicic acids with organosilanes in mixtures of 0.5 to 50 parts, referred to 10 0 parts of precipitated silicic acid, in particular 2 to 15 parts, referred to 100 parts of precipitated silicic acid, wherein the reaction between the precipitated silicic acid and organosilane is carried out<br><br>
11<br>
during the preparation of the mixture (in situ) or outside the preparation, by spraying followed by tempering the mixture, or by mixing the silane and the silicic acid suspension followed by drying and tempering.<br>
In addition to mixtures that contain as fillers exclusively the silicic acids according to the invention, with and without organosilanes according to formulae I to III, the rubber mixtures may in addition be filled with one or more fillers having a greater or lesser reinforcing effect.  For example a blend of carbon blacks (for example furnace, gas, flame, acetylene carbon blacks) and the silicic acids according to the invention, with and without silane, as well as of natural fillers, for example clays, silica chalks, further known and commercially available silicic acids, and the silicic acids according to the invention, may be used.<br>
The blend ratio is governed in this case, as in the metering of the organosilanes, according to the property spectrum to be achieved in the finished rubber mixture. The ratio of the precipitated silicic acids according to the invention to the other aforementioned fillers may be 5 - 95%.<br>
In addition to the silicic acid according to the invention, the organosilanes and other fillers, the elastomers form a further important constituent of the rubber mixture.  The silicic acids according to the invention may be used in all types of rubber crosslinkable with accelerators/sulfur, as well as rubbers crosslinkable with peroxides.  Elastomers that may be mentioned in this connection are natural and synthetic elastomers, oil-extended or not, as individual polymers or blends with other rubbers, for example natural rubbers, butadiene rubbers, isoprene rubbers, butadiene-styrene rubbers, in particular SBR, produced by means of<br><br>
12<br>
solution polymerisation, as well as butadiene-acrylonitrile rubbers, butyl rubbers, and terpolymers of ethylene, propylene and unconjugated dienes.  The following additional rubbers are also suitable for rubber mixtures with the aforementioned rubbers:<br>
Carboxyl rubbers, epoxide rubbers, trans-polypentenamers, halogenated butyl rubbers, 2-chloro-butadiene rubbers, ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymers, ethylene-propylene copolymers, and optionally also chemical derivatives of natural rubber as well as modified natural rubbers.<br>
Further additives such as plasticisers, stabilisers, activators, pigments, anti-oxidants and processing aids may be used in the conventional amounts.<br>
The precipitated silicic acids according to the invention, with and without silane, may be used in all rubber applications, particularly in tyres, above all in tyre carcasses, but also for example in conveyor belts, seals, V-belts, hoses, shoe soles, etc.<br>
The precipitated silicic acid according to the invention may furthermore be used in battery separators, in silicone rubber, and as supporting silicic acid.<br>
In order to achieve a good property spectrum in a polymer mixture, the dispersion of the precipitated silicic acid in the matrix, i.e. the polymer, is of decisive importance.<br>
It has been found that the wk coefficient is a measure of the dispersibility of a precipitated silicic acid.<br>
The wk coefficient is determined as follows:<br><br>
13<br>
The measurement is based on the principle of laser diffraction, a CILAS granulometer 1064 L being used for the measurement.<br>
To carry out the determination 1.3 g of the precipitated silicic acid is added to 25 ml of water and treated for 4M minutes with ultrasound at 100 W (90% pulsed).  The solution is then transferred to the measuring cell and treated for a further minute with ultrasound.<br>
The detection is performed during the ultrasound treatment using two lasers diodes arranged at different angles to the sample.  The laser beams are diffracted according to the principle of light diffraction.  The resultant diffraction pattern is evaluated with a computer.  The method enables the particle size distribution to be determined over a wide measurement range (ca. 4 0 nm - 500  m) .<br>
An essential point in this connection is that the energy supplied by the ultrasound simulates the energy supplied by mechanical forces in industrial mixing equipment used in the tyre industry.<br>
The results of the measurements of the particle size distribution of precipitated silicic acids according to the invention and of comparison silicic acids are shown in Figs. 1-6.<br>
The curves show a first maximum in the particle size distribution in the range around 1.0 - 100 urn, and a further maximum in the range 
 <br>
14<br>
that proportion of silicic acid particles that have been comminuted during the ultrasound treatment.  These very-small particles can be dispersed extremely well in rubber mixtures.<br>
The wk coefficient denotes the ratio of the peak height of the non-degradable particles (B), whose maximum is in the range 1.0 - 100  m (B1), to the peak height of the degraded particles (A), whose maximum is in the range 
The schematic diagram according to Fig. 7 illustrates these relationships.<br>
The wk coefficient is thus a measure of the "degradability" (= dispersibility) of the precipitated silicic acid.  It is found that a precipitated silicic acid is more easily dispersible the smaller the wk coefficient, i.e. the more particles that are degraded during incorporation into rubber.<br>
The silicic acids according to the invention have wk coefficients 
The dispersibility of a precipitated silicic acid is expressed by the dispersion coefficient D.  This is measured according to the following formula:<br><br>
15<br>
Sum of particle area/image area x 10 000 x Medalia factor<br>
D[%] =        	<br>
Filler volume x image area<br>
Filler volume/100 + 0.78<br>
Medalia factor =	<br>
2<br>
The evaluation is carried out by light microscopy at 150 x magnification on polished sections of the vulcanisates. Particles of size larger than 28 urn were evaluated as non-dispersible particles.  40 images were evaluated.<br>
