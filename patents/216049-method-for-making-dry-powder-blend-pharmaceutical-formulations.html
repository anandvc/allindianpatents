				<td>METHOD FOR MAKING DRY POWDER BLEND<br>
PHARMACEUTICAL FORMULATIONS<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
This invention is in the field of pharmaceutical formulation comprising microparticles<br>
and particulary a method for making dry powder blend pharmaceutical formulations.<br>
Microencapsulation of therapeutic and diagnostic agents is known to be a useful<br>
tool for enhancing the controlled delivery of such agents to humans or animals. For<br>
these applications, microparticles having very specific sizes and size ranges are,needed<br>
in order to effectively deliver these agents. Microparticles, however; may tend to<br>
agglomerate during their production and processing, thereby undesirably altering the<br>
effective size of the particles, to the detriment of the microparticle formulation's<br>
performance and/or reproducibility. Agglomeration depends on a variety of factors,<br>
including the temperature, humidity, and compaetion forces to which the microparticles<br>
are exposed, as well as the particular materials and methods used in making the<br>
microparticles. It therefore would be useful to deagglomerate the microparticles. post<br>
production and/or the microparticle dry powder formulations-using a process that do es<br>
not substantially affect the size and morphology of the microparticle as originally<br>
formed. Such a process preferably should be simple and operate af ambient conditions<br>
to minimize equipment and operating costs and to avoid degradation of pharmaceutical<br>
agents, such as thermally labile drugs.<br>
Microparticle production techniques typically require the use of one or more<br>
aqueous or organic solvents. For example, an organic solvent can be combined with,<br>
and then removed from, a polymeric matrix material in the process of forming<br>
polymeric microparticles by spray drying. An undesirable consequence, however, is<br>
that the mi crop articles often retain solvent residue. It is highly desirable to minimize<br>
these solvent residue levels in pharmaceutical formulations." It therefore would be<br>
advantageous to develop a process that enhances solvent removal from microparticle<br>
formulations.<br>
Similarly, it would be desirable to reduce moisture levels in microparticle-<br>
formulations, irrespective of the source by which the moisture is introduced, in order to<br>
decrease caking, increase flowabiliry, and improve storage stability of the formulation.<br>
For example, an aqueous solvent can be used to dissolve or disperse an excipient to<br>
facilitate mixing of the excipient with microparticles, after which the aqueous solvent is<br>
removed. It therefore would be advantageous to develop a process that enhances<br>
moisture removal from microparticle formulations.<br>
Excipients often are added to the microparticles and pharmaceutical agents in<br>
order to provide the microparticle formulations with certain desirable properties or to<br>
enhance processing of the microparticle formulations. For example, the excipients can<br>
facilitate administration of the microparticles, minimize micropanicle agglomeration<br>
upon storage or upon reconsritution, facilitate appropriate release or retention of the<br>
active agent, and/or enhance shelf life of the product. Representative types of these<br>
excipients include osmotic agents, bulking agents, surfactants, preservatives, wetting<br>
agents, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents, binders, disintegrants, glidants,<br>
and lubricants. It is important that the process of combining these excipients and<br>
microparticles yield a uniform blend. Combining these excipients with the<br>
microparticles can complicate production and scale-up; it is not a trivial matter to-make<br>
such microparticle pharmaceutical formulations, particularly on a commercial scale.<br>
Laboratory scale methods for producing microparticle pharmaceutical<br>
formulations may require several steps, which may not be readily or efficiently<br>
transferred to larger scale production. Examples of these steps include dispersing the<br>
microparticles, size classification of the microparticles, drying and/or lyophilizing<br>
them, loading them with one or more active agents, and combining them with one or<br>
more excipient materials to form a homogenous product ready for packaging. Some<br>
process steps such as freezing the microparticles (e.g., as part of a solvent removal<br>
process) by the use of liquid nitrogen are expensive and difficult to execute in a clean<br>
room for large volume operations. Other process steps, such as sonication, may require<br>
expensive custom made equipment to perform on larger scales. It would be<br>
advantageous to develop pharmaceutical formulation production methods to eliminate,<br>
combine, or simplify any of these steps.<br>
It therefore would be desirable to provide deagglomerated microparticle<br>
pharmaceutical formulations having low residuals. It would be particularly desirable<br>
for dry forms of the microparticle formulation to disperse and suspend well upon<br>
reconsritution, providing an injectable formulation. It would be desirable for dry forms<br>
of the microparticle formulation to disperse well in the dry form, presiding an inhalable<br>
formulation. It would be desirable for dry forms of the microparticle formulation to<br>
disperse well upon oral administration, providing a solid oral dosage form.<br>
WO 0189492 discloses a blend of formoterol fumanete dehydrate and lactose<br>
monohydrate which is mincronised in a spiral jet mill. This milled blend was then mixed<br>
with micronized budesonide, jet millad to deagglomerate, and then spheronized to<br>
agglomerates:<br>
WO 9615814 discloses making of hollow microcapsules that are useful to enhance ultro<br>
sound imaging. WO 9615814 teaches that agglomeration of the microcapsules can be<br>
ninimized by "milling" the microcapsules with or inert excipient using a Fritsch<br>
centrifugal bin mill or air inpact jet mill. However, this reference fails to teach jet milling<br>
the powder blend to deagglomerete while substantially maintaining the size of the<br>
individual microparticles.<br>
WO 9953501 discloses using a jet mill to micronize particles and reduce their size. Its<br>
examples suggest jet milling to reduce the size of particles.<br>
WO 0243701 discloses a method making composite active particles for use in<br>
pharmaceutical formulations by co-milling active particles with additive particles where<br>
preferably, the milling is not jet milling (micronisation).<br>
There are different approaches in the prior art referred above for either trying to prevent<br>
particles agglomeration in dry powder pharmaceutical formulations and/or for trying to<br>
deagglomerate them once formed.<br>
It would be desirable to provide a method for both deagglomerating<br>
microparticulate pharmaceutical formulations and reducing residual moisture (and/or<br>
solvent) levels in these formulations, using a process that does not substantially affect<br>
the size and morphology of the microparticle as originally formed. It would also be<br>
desirable to provide methods for making uniform blends of deagglomerated<br>
microparticles and excipients, preferably without the use of an excipient solvent. Such<br>
methods desirably would be adaptable for efficient, commercial scale production.<br>
The present invention provides a method of making a dry powder blend pharmaceutical<br>
formulation that enables the deagglomeration of drug microparticles in the blend without<br>
detrimentally impacting the microparticle size. This enables one to enhance content<br>
uniformity of the dry powder pharmaceutical confrontion which is very important in the<br>
production of dry powder drug formulations. The method also advantageously reduces<br>
residual moisture, which improves stability and handling of the dry powder and reduces<br>
the organic solvent levels in the microparticles.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
Improved methods have been developed for making pharmaceutical<br>
formulations comprising deagglomerated microparticles and for making blends of<br>
microparticles and excipients that have enhanced content uniformity. Jet milling<br>
advantageously breaks up microparticle agglomerates. The reduction of microparticle<br>
agglomerates leads to improved suspendability for injectable dosage forms, improved<br>
dispcrsibiliry for oral dosage forms, or improved aerodynamic properties for inhalable<br>
dosage forms Moreover, jet milling beneficially lowers residual moisture and solvent<br>
levels in the microparticles, leading to better stability and handling properties for the<br>
dry powder pharmaceutical formulations.<br>
As used herein, the terms "comprise, 'comprising," "include," and "including"<br>
are intended to be open, non-limiting terms, unless the contrary is expressly indicated.<br>
I. The Microparticle Formulations<br>
The formulations include microparticles comprising one or more pharmaceutical<br>
agents such as a therapeutic or a diagnostic agent, and optionally one or more<br>
excipients. In one embodiment, the formulation is a uniform dry powder blend<br>
comprising microparticles of a pharmaceutical agent blended with larger microparticles<br>
of an excipient.<br>
A. Microparticies<br>
As used herein, the term '"microparticle" includes microspheres and<br>
microcapsuies, as well as microparticies, unless otherwise specified Microparticles<br>
may or may not be spherical in shape. Microcapsuies are defined as microparticles<br>
having an outer shell surrounding a core of another material, in this case, the<br>
pharmaceutical agent. The core can be gas. liquid, gel. or solid. Microsphercs can be<br>
solid spheres, can be porous and include a sponge-like or honeycomb structure formed<br>
by pores or voids in a matrix material or shell, or can include a single internal void in a<br>
matrix material or shell.<br>
In one embodiment, the microparticles is formed entirely of the pharmaceutical<br>
agent. In another embodiment, the microparticle has a core of pharmaceutical agent<br>
encapsulated in a shell. In another embodiment, the pharmaceutical agent is<br>
interspersed within the shell or matrix. In another embodiment, the pharmaceutical<br>
agent is uniformly mixed within the material comprising the shell or matrix.<br>
Optionally, the microparticies can be blended with one or more excipients.<br>
1. Size and Morphology<br>
As used herein, the terms "size" or "diameter" in reference to microparticies<br>
refers to the number average particle size, unless otherwise'specified. An example of<br>
an equation that can be used to describe the number average particle size is shown<br>
below:<br><br>
where n = number of particles of a given diameter (d).<br>
As used herein, the term "volume average diameter" refers to the volume<br>
weighted diameter average. An example of an equation that can be used to describe the<br>
volume average diameter is shown below:<br><br>
where n = number of particles of a given diameter (d).<br><br>
As used herein, the term "aerodynamic diameter" refers to the equivalent<br>
diameter of a sphere with density of 1 g/mL were it to fall under gravity with the same<br>
velocity as the particle analyzed. The values of the aerodynamic average diameter for<br>
the distribution of particles are reported. Aerodynamic diameters can be determined on<br>
the dry powder using an Aerosizer (TSI), which is a time of flight technique, or by<br>
cascade impaction, or liquid impinger techniques.<br>
Particle size analysis can be performed on a Coulter counter, by light<br>
microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, laser<br>
diffraction methods, light scattering methods or time of flight methods. Where a<br>
Coulter method is described, the powder is dispersed in an electrolyte, and the resulting<br>
suspension analyzed using a Coulter Multisizer II fitted with a 50-um aperture tube.<br>
The jet milling process described herein deagglomerates agglomerated<br>
microparticles, such that the size and morphology of the individual microparticles is<br>
substantially maintained. That is, a comparison of the microparticle size before and<br>
after jet milling should show a volume average size reduction of at least 15% and a<br>
number average size reduction of no more than-75%.<br>
In the formulations, the microparticles preferably have a number average size<br>
between about 1 and 20 µm. It is believed that the jet milling processes will be most<br>
useful in deagglomerating microparticles having a volume average diameter or<br>
aerodynamic average diameter greater than about 2 µm. In one embodiment, the<br>
microparticles have a volume average size between 2 and 50 µm. In another<br>
embodiment, the microparticles have an aerodynamic diameter between 1 and 50 µm.<br>
The microparticles are manufactured to have a size (i.e., diameter) suitable for<br>
the intended route of administration. Particle size also can affect RES uptake. For<br>
intravascular administration, the microparticles preferably have a number average<br>
diameter of between 0.5 and 8 µm. For subcutaneous or intramuscular administration,<br>
the microparticles preferably have a number average diameter of between about 1 and<br>
100 µm. For oral administration for delivery to the gastrointestinal tract and for<br>
application to other lumens or mucosal surfaces (e.g., rectal, vaginal, buccal, or nasal),<br>
the microparticles preferably have a number average diameter of between 0.5 µm and 5<br>
mm. A preferred size for administration to the pulmonary system is an aerodynamic<br>
diameter of between 1 and 5 µm, with an actual volume average diameter (or an<br>
aerodynamic average diameter) of 5 µm or less.<br>
In one embodiment, the microparticles comprise microsphercs having voids<br>
therein. In one embodiment, the microspheres have a number average size between 1<br>
and 3 µm and a volume average size between 3 and 8 µm.<br>
i In another embodiment, jet milling increases the crystallinily or decreases the<br>
amorphous content of the drug within the microspheres as assessed by differential<br>
scanning calorimetry.<br>
2. Pharmaceutical Agents<br>
The pharmaceutical agent is a therapeutic, diagnostic, or prophylactic agent.<br>
The pharmaceutical agent is sometimes referred to herein generally as a "drug" or<br>
"active agent." The pharmaceutical agent may be present in an amorphous state, a<br>
crystalline state, or a mixture thereof. The pharmaceutical agent may be labeled with a<br>
detectable label such as a fluorescent label, radioactive label or an enzymatic or<br>
chromatographically detectable agent.<br>
A wide variety of therapeutic, diagnostic and prophylactic agents can be loaded<br>
into the microparticles. These can be proteins or peptides, sugars, oligosaccharides,<br>
nucleic acid molecules, or other synthetic or natural agents. Representative examples<br>
of suitable drugs include the following categories and examples-of drugs and alternative<br>
forms of these drugs such as alternative salt forms, free acid forms, free base forms, and<br>
hydrates:<br>
analgesics/antipyretics (e.g., aspirin, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, naproxen sodium,<br>
buprenorphine, propoxyphene hydrochloride, propoxyphene napsylate, mcperidine<br>
hydrochloride, hydromorphone hydrochloride, morphine, oxycodone, codeine,<br>
dihydrocodeine bitarrrate, pentazocine. hydrocodone bitarrrate, Ievorphanol, diflunisal.<br>
trolamine salicylate, nalbuphine hydrochloride, mefenamic acid, butorphanol, choline<br>
salicylate, butalbital, phenyltoloxamine citrate, and meprobamate);<br>
antiasthmatics (e.g., ketotifen and traxanox);<br>
antibiotics (e.g., neomycin, streptomycin, chloramphenicol, cephalosporin, ampicillin,<br>
penicillin, tetracycline, and ciprofloxacin);<br>
antidepTessants (e.g., nefopam, oxypertine, doxepin, amoxapine, trazodone,<br>
amitriptyline, maprotiline, phenelzine, desipramine, nortriptyline, tranylcypromine,<br>
fluoxetine, imipramine, imipramine pamoate, isocarboxazid, ftimipramine, and<br>
protriptyline);<br><br><br>
antineoplastics (e.g., cyclophosphamide. actinomycin, bleomycin. daunorubicin,<br>
doxorubicin. epirubicin, mitomycin, methotrexate, fluorouracil, carboplatin, carmustine<br>
(BCNU), methyl-CCNU, cisplatin, etoposide, camptothecin and derivatives thereof,<br>
phenesterine, paclitaxel and derivatives thereof, docetaxel and derivatives thereof,<br>
vinblastine, vincristine, tamoxifen, and piposulfan);<br>

embodiment, the gas is a biocompatible or pharmacologically acceptable fluorinated<br>
gas, as described, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 5,611,344 to Bernstein et al. The<br><br>
term "gas" refers to any compound that is a gas or capable of forming a cas at the<br>
temperature at which imaging is being performed. The gas may be composed of a<br>
single compound or a mixture of compounds. Perfluorocjrbon gases are preferred:<br>

3. The Shell Material<br>
The shell material can be a synthetic material or a natural material. -The Shell<br>
material can be water soluble or water insoluble. The microparticles can be formed of<br>
non-biodegradable or biodegradable materials, although biodegradable materials are<br>
preferred, particularly for parenteral administration. Examples of types of shell<br>
materials include polymers, amino acids, sugars, proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids.<br>
Polymeric shell materials can be degradable or non-degradable, erodible or non-<br>
erodible. natural or synthetic. Non-erodible polymers may be used for oral<br>
administration. In general, synthetic polymers are preferred due to more reproducible<br>
synthesis and degradation. Natural polymers also may be used. Natural biopolymers<br>
that degrade by hydrolysis, such as polyhydroxybutyrate, may be of particular interest.<br>
The polymer is selected based on a variety of performance factors, including the time<br>
required for /';; vivo stability, i.e., the time required for distribution to the site where<br>
delivery is desired, arjd the time desired for delivery. Other selection factors may<br>
include shelf life, degradation rate, mechanical properties, and glass transition<br><br>
temperature of the polymer.<br>
Representative synthetic polymers are poly(hydroxy acids) such as poly(lactie<br>
acid), poly(glycolic acid), and poly(lactic acid-co-glycolic acid), poly(lactide).<br>
poly(glycolide), poly(lactide-co-glycolide), polyanliydrides, polyorthoesiers.<br>

esters, nitro celluloses, methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose,<br>
hydroxy-propyl methyl cellulose, hydroxybutyl methyl cellulose, cellulose acetate,<br>
cellulose propionate, cellulose acetate butyrate, cellulose acetate phthalate,<br>
carboxyethyl cellulose, cellulose triacetate, and cellulose sulphate sodium salt jointly"<br>
referred to herein as "synthetic celluloses"), polymers of acrylic acid, methacrylic acid<br>
or copolymers or derivatives thereof including esters, poly(methyl methacrylate),<br>
poly(ethyl methacrylate), poly(butylmethacrylate), poly(isobutyl methacrylate),<br>
poly(hexylmethacrylate), poly(isodecyl methacrylate), poly(lauryl methacrylate)<br>
poly(phenyl methacrylate), poiy(methyl acrylate), poly(isopropyl acrylate),<br>
poly(isobutyl acrylate), and poly(octadecyl acrylate) (jointly referred to her'ein'as<br>
"polyacrylic acids"), poly(butyric acid), poly(valeric acid), and poly(lactide-co-<br>
caprolactone), copolymers and blends thereof. As used herein, "derivatives" include<br>
polymers having substitutions, additions of chemical groups, for example, alky],<br>
alkylene, hydroxylations, oxidations, and other modifications routinely made by those<br>
skilled in the art.<br>
Examples of preferred biodegradable polymers include polymers of hydroxy<br>
acids such as lactic acid and glycolic acid, and copolymers with PEG, polyanhydrides,<br>
poly(ortho)esters, polyurethanes, poly(butyric acid), poly(valeric acid), poly(lactide-co-<br>
caprolactone), blends and copolymers thereof.<br>
Examples of preferred natural polymers include proteins such as albumin and<br>
prolamines, for example, zein, and polysaccharides such as alginate, cellulose and<br>
polyhydroxyalkanoates, for example, polyhydroxybutyrate. The in vivo stability of the<br><br><br>
matrix can be adjusted during the production by using polymers such as polylactide-co-<br>
glycolide copolymerized with polyethylene glyco! (PEG). PEG. if exposed or. the<br>
external surface, may extend the time these materials circulate post inrravascular<br>
administration, as it is hydrophilic and has been demonstrated to mask RES<br>
(reticuloendothelial system) recognition.<br>
Examples of preferred non-biodegradable polymers include ethylene vinyl<br>
acetate, poly(meth)acrylic acid, polyamides, copolymers and mixtures thereof.<br>
Bioadhcsive polymers can be of particular interest for use in targeting of<br>
mucosal surfaces (e.g.. in the gastrointestinal tract, mouth, nasal cavity. Inns, vagina,<br>
and eye). Examples of these include polyanhydrides. polyacrylic acid, poly(methyl<br>
methacrylates), poly(ethyl mcthacrylates), poly(butylmethacrylate), poly(isobulyl<br>
methacrylate), poly(hexylmethacrylate). poly(isodecyl methacrylate), poly(lauryl<br>

mixtures. Amino acids that can be used include glycinc. arginine, histidine, threonine,<br>
asparagine, aspartic acid, serine, glutamate, proline, cysteine, methioniue, valine,<br>
leucine, isoleucine, rryptophan, phenylalanine, tyrosine, lysine, alanine, and glutamine.<br>
The amino acid can be used as a bulking agent, or as an anti-crystallization agent for<br>
drugs in the amorphous state, or as a crystal growth inhibitor for drugs in the crystalline<br>
state or as a wetting agent. Hydrophobic amino acids such as leucine, isoleucine,<br>
alanine. glucine, valine, proline. cysteine, methionine, phenylalanine, tryptophan are<br>
more likely to be effective as anticrystallization agents or crystal growth inhibitors. In<br>
addition, amino acids can serve to make the shell have a pH dependency that can be<br>
used to influence the pharmaceutical properties of the shell such as solubility, rate of<br>
dissolution or wetting.<br>
The shell material can be the same or different from the excipient material, if<br>
present. In one embodiment, the excipient can comprise the same classes or types of<br>
material used to form the shell. In another embodiment, the excipient comprises one or<br>
more materials different from the shell material. In this latter embodiment, the<br>
excipient can be a surfactant, wetting agent, salt, bulking agent, etc. In one<br><br><br>
embodiment, the formulation comprises (a) microparticles that have a core of a drug<br>
and a shell comprising a sugar or ammo acid, blended with (b) another sugar or amino<br>
acid that functions as a bulking or tonicity agent.<br>
B. Excipients<br>
The term "excipient" refers to any non-active ingredient of the formulation<br>
intended to facilitate delivery and administration by the intended route. For example,<br>
the excipient can comprise proteins, amino acids, sugars or other carbohydrates,<br>
starches, lipids, or combinations thereof. The excipient may enhance handling,<br>
stability, aerodynamic properties, and dispersibility of the active agent.<br>
In preferred embodiments, the excipient is a dry powder (e.g., in the form of<br>
microparticles,) which is blended with drug microparticles. Preferably, the excipient<br>
microparticles are larger in size than the pharmaceutical microparticles. In one<br>
embodiment, the excipient microparticles have a volume average size between about 10<br>
and 500. µm, preferably between 20 and 200 µm, more preferably between 40 and 100<br>
µm.<br>
Representative amino acids that can be used in the drug matrices include both<br>
naturally occurring and non-naturally occurring amino acids. The amino acids-can be<br>
hydrophobic or hydrophilic and may be D amino acids, L amino acids or racemic<br>
mixtures. Amino acids that can be used include glycine, arginine, histidine, threonine,<br>
asparagine, aspartic acid, serine, glutamate, proline, cysteine, methionine, valine,<br>
leucine. isoleucine, tryptophan, phenylalanine, tyrosine, lysine, alanine, glutamine. The<br>
amino acid can be used as a bulking agent, as a wetting agent, or as a crystal growth<br>
inhibitor for drugs in the crystalline state. Hydrophobic amino acids such as leucine,<br>
isoleucine, alanine, glucine, valine, proline, cysteine, methionine, phenylalanine,<br>
tryptophan are more likely to be effective as crystal growth inhibitors. In addition,<br>
amino acids can serve to make the matrix have a pH dependency that can be used to<br>
influence the pharmaceutical properties of the matrix, such as solubility, rate of<br>
dissolution, or wetting.<br>
Examples of excipients include pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and<br>
bulking agents, including sugars such as lactose, mannitol, trehalose, xylitol, sorbitol,<br>
dextran, sucrose, and fructose. These sugars may also serve as wetting agents. Other<br>
suitable excipients include surface active agents, dispersants, osmotic agents, binders,<br>
disintegrants, glidants, diluents, color agents, flavoring agents, sweeteners, and<br><br><br>
lubricants. Examples include sodium desoxycholate; sodium dodecylsulfate;<br>
polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters, e.g., potyoxyethylene 20 sorbitan<br>
monolaurate (TWEEN™ 20), polyoxyethylene 4 sorbitan monolaurate (TWEEN™ 21),<br>
polyoxyethylene 20 sorbitan monopalmitate (TWEEN™ 40), polyoxyethylene 20<br>
sorbitan monooleate (TWEEN™ 80); polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers, e.g.,<br>
polyoxyethylene 4 lauryl ether (BRIJ™ 30), polyoxyethylene 23 lauryl ether (BRII™<br>
35), polyoxyethylene 10 oleyl ether (BRIJ™ 97); polyoxyethylene glycol esters, e.g.,<br>

sodium starch glycolate. Examples of glidants include colloidal silicon dioxide and<br>
talc. Examples of diluents include dicalcium phosphate, calcium sulfate, lactose,<br>
cellulose, kaolin, mannitol, sodium chloride, dry starch and powdered sugar. Examples<br>
of lubricants include talc, magnesium stearate, calcium stearate, stearic acid,<br>
. hydrogenated vegetable oils, and polyethylene glycol.<br>
The amounts of excipient for a particular formulation depend on a variety of<br>
factors and can be selected by one skilled in the art. Examples of these factors include<br>
the choice of excipient, the type and amount of drug, the microparticle size and<br>
morphology, and the desired properties and route of administration of the final<br>
formulation.<br>
In one embodiment for injectable microparticles, a combination of mannitol and<br>
TWEEN™ 80 is blended with polymeric microspheres. In one case, the mannitol is<br>
provided at between 100 and 200 % w/w, preferably 130 and 170 % w/w,<br>
microparticles, while the TWEEN™ 80 is provided at between 0.1 and 10 % w/w,<br>
preferably 3.0 and 5.1 % w/w microparticles. In another case, the mannitol is provided<br>
with a volume average particle size between 10 and 500 µm.<br>
In another embodiment, the excipient comprises binders, disintegrants, glidants,<br>
diluents, color agents, flavoring agents, sweeteners, lubricants, or combinations thereof<br>
for use in a solid oral dosage form. Examples of solid oral dosage forms include<br>
capsules, tablets, and wafers.<br><br>
II. Methods of Making the Microparticle Formulations<br>
The pharmaceutical formulations are made by a process that includes forming a<br>
quantity of microparticles comprising a pharmaceutical agent and having a selected size<br>
and morphology; and then jet milling the microparticles effective to deagglomerate the<br>
agglomerated microparticles while substantially maintaining the size and morphology<br>
of the individual microparticles. That is, the jet milling step deagglomerates the<br>
microparticles without significantly fracturing individual microparticles. The jet<br>
milling step can advantageously reduce moisture content and residual solvent levels in<br>
the formulation, can improve the suspendability and wettability of the dry powder<br>
formulation (e.g., for better injectability), and give the dry powder formulation<br>
improved aerodynamic properties (e.g., for better pulmonary deliver}').<br>
In one embodiment, the process further (and optionally) includes blending the<br>
microparticles with one or more excipients, to create uniform blends of microparticles<br>
and excipients in the dry state. Preferably, the blending is conducted before the jet<br>
milling step. If desired, however, some or all of the components of the blended<br>
formulation can be jet milled before being blended together. Additionally, such blends<br>
can be further jet milled again to deagglomerate the blended microparticles.<br>
One specific embodiment of the process is illustrated in FIG. 1. In this<br>
embodiment, microspheres are produced by spray drying in spray dryer 10. The<br>
microspheres are then blended with excipients in blender 20. Finally, the blended<br>
microsphcres/excipients are fed to jet mill 30, where the microspheres are<br>
deagglomerated and residual solvent levels reduced. The moisture level in the<br>
microsphere formulation also can be reduced in the jet milling process. In addition, the<br>
content uniformity of the blended microspheres/excipientscan be improved over that of<br>
the non-jet milled blended microspheres/excipients.<br>
The processes described herein generally can be conducted using batch,<br>
continuous, or semi batch methods.<br>
Microparticle Production<br>
The microparticles can be made using a variety of techniques known in the art.<br>
Suitable techniques include spray drying, melt extrusion, compression molding, fluid<br>
bed drying, solvent extraction, hot melt encapsulation, phase inversion encapsulation,<br>
and solvent evaporation.<br><br><br>
In the most preferred embodiment, the micronarticles arc produced by spray<br>
drying. See. e.g., U.S. Patents No. 5,853.69S to Srraub et al.; No. 5.611.344 to<br>
Bernstein et al.; No. 6.395,300 to Straub et al.; and No. 6.223,455 to ("nickering HI. et<br>
ai. For example, the microparticles can be produced by dissolving a pharmaceutical<br>
agent and/or shell material in an appropriate solvent, (and optionally dispersing a solid<br>
or liquid active agent, pore forming agent (e.g., a volatile salt), or other additive into the<br>
solution containing the pharmaceutical agent and/or shell material) and then spray<br>
drying the solution, to form microparticles. As defined herein, the process of "spray<br>
drying" a solution containing a pharmaceutical agent and or shell material refers to a<br>
process wherein the solution is atomized to form a fine mist and dried by direct contact<br>
with hot carrier gases. Using spray drying equipment available in the art, the solution<br>
containing the pharmaceutical agent and/or shell material may be atomized intoa<br>
drying chamber, dried within the chamber, and then collected via a cyclone at the outlet<br>
of the chamber. Representative examples of types of suitable atomization devices<br>
include ultrasonic, pressure feed, air atomizing, and rotating disk. The temperature may<br>
be varied depending on the solvent or materials.used.. The temperature of the inlet and<br>
outlet ports can be controlled to produce the desired products. The size of the <br>
particulates of pharmaceutical agent and/or shell material is a function of the nozzle<br>
used to spray the solution of pharmaceutical agent and/or shell material, nozzle<br>
pressure, the solution and atomization flow rates, the pharmaceutical agent and/or shell<br>
material used, the concentration of the pharmaceutical agent and/or shell material, the<br>
type of solvent, the temperature of spraying (both inlet and outlet temperature), and the<br>
molecular weight of a shell material such as a polymer or other matrix material.<br>
Generally, the higher the molecular weight, the larger the particle size, assuming the<br>
concentration is the same (because an increase in molecular weight generally increases<br>
the solution viscosity). Microparticles having a target diameter between 0.5 and 500<br>
µm can be obtained. The morphology of these microparticles depends, for example, on<br>
the selection of shell material, concentration, molecular weight of a shell material such<br>
as a polymer or other matrix material, spray flow, and drying conditions.<br>
Solvent evaporation is described by Mathiowitz, et al., J. Scanning Microscopy,<br>
4:329 (1990); Beck, et al., Fertil Steril, 31:545 (1979); and Benita, et al., J. Pltarm.<br>
Sci., 73:1721 (19S4). In this method, a shell material is dissolved in a volatile-organic<br>
solvent such as methylenc chloride. A pore forming agent as a solid or as a liquid may<br><br>
be added to the solution. The pharmaceutical agent can be added as either a solid or<br>
solution to the shell material solution. The mixture is sonicated or homogenized and<br>
the resulting dispersion or emulsion is added to an aqueous solution that may contain a<br>
surface active agent (such as TWEEN™20, TWEENTM80. polyethylene glycol. or<br>
polyvinyl alcohol), and homogenized to form an emulsion. The resulting emulsion is<br>
stirred until most of the organic solvent evaporates, leaving microparticlcs. Several<br>
different polymer concentrations can be used (e.g., 0.05-0.60 gmL) Micropanicles<br>
with different sizes (1-1000 µm) and morphologies can be obtained by this method.<br>
This method is particularly useful for shell materials comprising relatively stable<br>
polymers such as polyesters.<br>
Hot-melt microencapsulation is described in Mathiowitz, et al., Reactive<br>
Polymers. 6:275 (1987). In this method, a shell material is first melted and then mixed<br>
with a solid or liquid pharmaceutical agent. A pore forming agent as a solid or in<br>
solution may be added to the melt. The mixture is suspended in a non-miscible solvent<br>
(e.g., silicon oil), and, while stirring continuously, heated to 5 °C above the melting<br>
point of the shell material. Once the emulsion is stabilized, it is cooled until the shell<br>
material particles solidify. The resulting microparticles are washed by decantation with<br>
a shell material non-solvent, such as petroleum ether, to give a frre flowing powder.<br>
Generally, microparticles with sizes between 50 and 5000 µn are obtained with this<br>
method. The external surfaces of particles prepared with this technique are usually<br>
smooth and dense. This procedure is used to prepare microparticles made of polyesters<br>
and polyanhydrides. However, this method is limited to shell materials such as<br>
polymers with molecular weights between 1000 and 50,000. Preferred polyanhydrides<br>
include polyanhydrides made of biscarboxyphenoxypropanc and sebacic acid with<br>
molar ratio of 20:80 (P(CPP-SA) 20:80) (MW 20,000) and poly(fumaric-co-sebacic)<br>
(20:80) (MW 15,000).<br>
Solvent removal is a technique primarily designed for shell materials such as<br>
polyanhydrides. In this method, the solid or liquid pharmaceutical agent is dispersed or<br>
dissolved in a solution of a shell material in a volatile organic solvent, such as<br>
mcthylene chloride. This mixture is suspended by stirring in an organic oil (e.g., silicon<br>
oil) to form an emulsion. Unlike solvent evaporation, however, this method can be<br>
used to make microparticles from shell materials such as polymers with high melting<br><br><br>
points and different molecular weights. The external morphology of particles produced<br>
with this technique is highly dependent on the type of sheli material used.<br>
Extrusion techniques can be used to make microparticles. In this method,<br>
microparticles made of shell materials such as gel-type polymers, such as<br>
polyphosphazene or polymethylmethacrylate, are produced by dissolving the shell<br>
material in an aqueous solution, suspending if desired a pore forming agent in the<br>
mixture, homogenizing the mixture, and extruding the material through a microdroplet<br>
forming device, producing microdroplets that fall into a slowly stirred hardening bath of<br>
an oppositely charged ion or polyelectrolyte solution. The advantage of these systems<br>
is the ability to further modify the surface of the hydrogel microparticles by coating<br>
them with polycationic polymers, like polylysine, after fabrication. Microparticle size<br>
can be controlled by using various size extruders or atomizing devices.<br>
Phase inversion encapsulation is described in U.S. Patent No. 6,143,211 to.<br>
Mathiowitz, et al. By using relatively low viscosities and/or relatively low shell .<br>
material concentrations, by using solvent and nonsolvent pairs that are miscible and by<br>
using greater than ten fold excess of nonsolvent, a continuous phase of nonsolvent with<br>
dissolved pharmaceutical agent and/or shell material can be rapidly introduced into the<br>
nonsolvent. This causes a phase inversion and spontaneous formation of discreet<br>
microparticles, typically having an average particle size of between 10 nm and 10 urn.<br>
Jet Milling<br>
As used herein, the terms "jet mill" and "jet milling" include and refer to the use<br>
of any type of fluid energy impact mills, including spiral jet mills, loop jet mills, and<br>
fluidized bed jet mills, with or without internal air classifiers. As used herein, jet<br>
milling is a teclinique for substantially deagglomerating microparticle agglomerates that<br>
have been produced during or subsequent to formation of the microparticles, by<br>
bombarding the feed particles with high velocity air or other gas, typically in a spiral or<br>
circular flow. The jet milling process conditions are selected so that the microparticles<br>
are substantially deagglomerated while substantially maintaining the size and<br>
morphology of the individual microparticles, which can be quantified as providing a<br>
volume average size reduction of at least 15% and a number average size reduction of<br>
no more than 75%. The process is characterized by the acceleration of particles in a gas<br>
stream to high velocities for impingement on other particles, similarly accelerated.<br>
A typical spiral jet mill is illustrated in FIG. 2. The jet mill 50 is shown in<br><br><br>
cross-section. Microparticles (blended or unblended) are fed into feed chute 52, and<br>
injection gas is fed through one or more ports 56. The microparticles are forced<br>
through injector 54 into deagglomeration chamber 58. The microparticles enter an<br>
extremely rapid vortex in the chamber 58, where they collide with one another and with<br>
chamber walls until small enough to be dragged out of a central discharge port 62 in the<br>
mill by the gas stream (against centrifugal forces experienced in the vortex). Grinding<br>
gas is fed from port 60 into gas supply ring 61. The grinding gas then is fed into the<br>
chamber 58 via a plurality of apertures; only two 63a and 63b are shown.<br>
Deagglomerated, uniformly blended, microparticles are discharged from the mill 50.<br>
The selection of the material forming the bulk of the microparticles and the<br>
temperature of the microparticles in the mill are among the factors that affect<br>
deagglomeration. Therefore, the mill optionally can be provided with a temperature<br>
control system. For example, the control system may heat the microparticlesy rendering<br>
the material less brittle and thus less easily fractured in the mill, thereby minimizing<br>
unwanted size reduction. Alternatively, the control system may need to cool the<br>
microparticles to below the glass transition or melting temperature of the material, so<br>
that deagglomeration is possible.<br>
In one embodiment, a hopper and feeder are used to control introduction of dry<br>
powder materials into the jet mill, providing a constant flow of material to the mill.<br>
Examples of suitable feeders include vibratory feeders and screw feeders. Other means<br>
known in the art also can be used for introducing the dry powder materials into the jet<br>
mill.<br>
In one operation method, the microparticles are aseptically fed to the jet mill via<br>
a feeder, and a suitable gas, preferably dry nitrogen, is used to feed and grind the<br>
microparticles through the mill. Grinding and feed gas pressures can be adjusted based<br>
on the material characteristics. Preferably, these gas pressures are between 0 and 10<br>
bar, more preferably between 2 and 8 bar. Microparticle throughput depends on the<br>
size and capacity of the mill. The milled microparticles can be collected by filtration<br>
or, more preferably, cyclone.<br>
It was discovered that jet milling the microparticles not only deagglomerates the<br>
microparticles, but also can lower the residual solvent and moisture levels in the<br>
microparticles. Thus, a single process step was found to provide both deagglomeration<br>
and moisture/solvent reduction. To achieve reduced residual levels, the<br><br>
injection/grinding gas preferably is a low humidity gas, such as dry nitrogen. In one<br>
embodiment, the injection/grinding gas is at a temperature less than 100 oC (e.g, less<br>
than 75 °C, less than 50 °C. less than 25 °C etc.).<br>
It was also found that by jet milling the microparticles (or a microparlicle-<br>
comprising dry powder blend) to deagglomerate them.it improved the dispersibility of<br>
the niicroparticles. As used herein, the term "dispcrsibility includes the suspendability<br>
of a powder (e.g.. a quantity or dose of microparticles) within a liquid, as well as the<br>
aerodynamic properties of such a powder or such microparticles. Accordingly, the term<br>
'improved dispersibility" refers to a reduction of particle-particle interactions of the<br>
micropaiticles of a powder within a liquid or a gas.<br>
In another embodiment, jet milling the microparticles can induce transformation •<br>
of the drug within the microparticles from an at least partially amorphous Term to a less<br>
amorphous form (i.e., a more crystalline form). This advantageously provides the drug<br>
in a more stable form.<br>
Blending<br>
In a preferred embodiment, dry uniform microparticle blends are produced.<br>
. That is, the dcagglomerated microparticles can be blended with another material, such<br>
as an excipient material, a (second) pharmaceutical agent, or a combination thereof. Jet<br>
milling can advantageously enhance the content uniformity of a dry powder blend.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the excipient or pharmaceutical agent is in the form<br>
of a dry powder. In one embodiment, the methods for deagglomerating further include<br>
blending microparticles with one or more other materials having a larger particle size<br>
than that of the microparticles.<br>
In one embodiment, a blend is made by deagglomerating microparticles<br>
comprising a first pharmaceutical agent, and then blending these microparticles (in one<br>
or more steps) with one or more excipient materials and with a second pharmaceutical<br>
agent. In a second embodiment, a blend is made of two or more pharmaceutical agents,<br>
without an excipient material. For example, the method could include deagglomerating<br>
microparticles comprising a first pharmaceutical agent, and then blending these<br>
microparticles with a second pharmaceutical agent. Alternatively, niicroparticles<br>
comprising the first pharmaceutical agent could be blended with microparticles<br>
comprising the second pharmaceutical agent, and the resulting blend could then be<br>
deagglomerated.<br><br>
The blending can be conducted in one or more steps, in a continuous, batch, or<br>
semi-batch process. For example, if two or more cxeipients are used, they can be<br>
blended together before, or at the same time as. being blended with the microparticles<br>
Generally, there arc two approaches for adding excipients to micropaarticles: wet<br>
addition and dry addition. Wet addition typically involves adding an aqueous solution<br>
of the excipient to the microparticles. The microparticles are then dispersed by mixing<br>
and may require additional processing such as sonication to fully disperse the<br>
microparticles. To create the dry dispersion, the water must be removed, for example,<br>
using methods such as lyophilization. It would be desirable to eliminate the wet<br>
processing, and thus use dry addition. In dry addition, the excipients are added to the<br>
microparticles in the dry state and the components are blended using standard dry. solid<br>
mixing techniques. Dry blending advantageously eliminates the need to dissolve or<br>
disperse the excipient in a solvent before combining the excipient with the<br>
microparticles and thus eliminates the need to subsequently remove that solvent. This<br>
is particularly advantageous when the solvent removal step would otherwise require<br>
lyophilization, freezing, distillation, or vacuum drying steps.<br>
Content uniformity of solid-solid pharmaceutical blends is critical. Jet milling<br>
can be conducted on the microparticles either before and/or after blending, to enhance<br>
content uniformity. In a preferred embodiment, the microparticles are Wended with one<br>
or more excipients of interest, and the resulting blend is then jet milled to yield a<br>
uniform mixture of deagglomerated microparticles and excipient.<br>
Jet-milling advantageously can provide improved wetting and dispersibility<br>
upon reconstitution. In addition, the resulting microparticle formulation can provide<br>
improved injectability, passing through the needle of a syringe more easily.<br>
Jet-milling advantageously can provide improved dispersibility of the dry<br>
powder, which provides for improved aerodynamic properties for pulmonary,<br>
administration.<br>
In another embodiment, the jet-milled microparticles or jet-milled blends of<br>
microparticles/excipient can be further processed into a solid oral dosage form, such as<br>
a power-filled capsule, a wafer, or a tablet. Jet-milling advantageously can provide<br>
improved wetting and dispersibility upon oral dosing as a solid oral dosage form<br>
formed from jet-milled microparticles or jet-milled microparticle/excipient blend.<br><br>
The blending can be carried out using essentially any technique or device<br>
suitable for combining the microparticles with one or more other materials (e.g.,<br>
excipients), preferably to achieve uniformity of blend. For example, the blending<br>
process can be performed using a variety of blenders. Representative examples of<br>
suitable blenders include V-blenders, slant-cone blenders, cube blenders, bin blenders,<br>
static continuous blenders, dynamic continuous blenders, orbital screw blenders,<br>
planetary blenders, Forberg blenders, horizontal double-arm blenders, horizontal high<br>
intensity mixers, vertical high intensity mixers, stirring vane mixers, twin cone mixers,<br>
drum mixers, and tumble blenders. The blender preferably is of a strict sanitary design<br>
required for pharmaceutical products.<br>
Tumble blenders are preferred for batch operation. In one embodiment,<br>
blending is accomplished by aseptically combining two or more components -(which<br>
can include both dry components and small portions of liquid components) in a suitable<br>
container. The container may, for example, be a polished, stainless steel or a glass<br>
container. The container is then sealed and placed (i.e., secured) into the tumble<br>
blender (e.g., TURBULA™, distributed by Glen Mills Inc., Clifton, NJ, USA, .and<br>
made by Willy A. Bachofen AG, Maschinenfabrik, Basel, Switzerland) and then mixed<br>
at a specific speed for an appropriate duration. (TURBULA™ lists speeds of 22, 32,<br>
46, 67, and 96 rpm for its model T2F, which has a 2L basket and a maximum load of 10<br>
kg.) Durations preferably are between about five minutes and.six hours, more<br>
preferably between about 5 and 60 minutes. Actual operating parameters will depend,<br>
for example, on the particular formulation, size of the mixing vessel, andquantity of<br>
material being blended.<br>
For continuous or semi-continuous operation, the blender optionally may be<br>
provided with a rotary feeder, screw conveyor, or other feeder mechanism for controlled<br>
introduction of one or more of the dry powder components into the blender.<br>
Other Steps in the Formulation Process<br>
The blended and jet milled product may undergo additional processing.<br>
Representative examples of such processes include lyophilization or vacuum drying to<br>
further remove residual solvents, temperature conditioning to anneal materials, size<br>
classification to recover or remove certain fractions of the particles (i.e., to optimize the<br>
size distribution), compression molding to form a tablet or other geometry, and<br>
packaging. In one embodiment, oversized (e.g., 20 µm or larger, preferably 10 µm or<br><br>
larger) microparticles are separated from the microparricles of interest. Some<br>
formulations also may undergo sterilization, such as by gamma irradiation.<br>
III. Applications for Using the Microparticle Formulations<br>
In preferred embodiments, the microparticle formulations are administered to a<br>
human or animal in need thereof, for the delivery of a therapeutic, diagnostic, or<br>
prophylactic agent in an effective amount. The formulations can be administered in dry<br>
form or dispersed in a physiological solution for injection or oral administration. The<br>
dry form can be aerosolized and inhaled for pulmonary administration. The route of<br>
administration depends on the pharmaceutical agent being delivered.<br>
The microparticle formulations containing an encapsulated imaging agent may<br>
be used in vascular imaging, as well as in applications to detect liver and renal diseases,<br>
in cardiology applications, in detecting and characterizing tumor masses and tissues,<br>
and in measuring peripheral blood velocity. The microparticles also can be linked with<br>
ligands that minimize tissue adhesion or that target the microparticles to specific<br>
regions of the body in vivo as known in the art.<br>
The invention can further be understood with reference to the following non-<br>
limiting examples.<br>
Examples<br>
Blending and jet milling experiments were carried out, combining PLGA<br>
microspheres, TWEEN™ 80 (Spectrum Chemicals, New Brunswick, NJ), and mannitol<br>
(Spectrum Chemicals). TWEEN™ 80 is hereinafter referred to as "TweenSO." Dry<br>
blending was carried out based on the following relative amounts of each material: 39<br>
mg of PLGA microspheres, 54.6 mg of mannitol, and 0.16 mg of TweenSO.<br>
A TURBULA™ inversion mixer (model: T2F) was used for blending. An<br>
Alpine Aeroplex Spiral Jet Mill (model: 50AS), with dry nitrogen gas as the injector<br>
and grinding gases, was used for de-agglomeration. Four blending processes were<br>
tested, and three different jet mill operating conditions were tested for each of the four<br>
blending processes, as described in Examples 1-4.<br>
In all of the studies, the dry powder was fed manually into the jet mill and hence<br>
the powder feed rate was not constant. It should be noted that although the powder<br>
feeding was manual, the feed rate was calculated to be approximately 1.0 g/min. for all<br>
of the studies. Feed rate is the ratio of total material processed in one batch to the total<br>
batch time. Particle size measurement of the jet milled samples, unless otherwise<br><br>
indicated, was conducted using a Coulter Multisizer II with a 50 µm aperture. Where<br>
aerodynamic particle size is reported, the analysis was performed using an Aerosizer<br>
(TSI, Inc.).<br>
The PLGA microspheres used in Examples I -4 originated from the same batch<br>
("Lot A"). The microspheres were prepared as follows: A polymer emulsion was<br>
prepared, composed of droplets of an aqueous phase suspended in a continuous<br>
polymer/organic solvent phase. The polymer was a commercially obtained<br>
poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) (50:50), and the organic solvent was methylene<br>
chloride. The resulting emulsion was spray dried at a flow rate of 150 mL/min with an<br>
outlet temperature of 12 °C on a custom spray dryer with a drying chamber.<br>
The PLGA microspheres used in Example 5 were from Lot A as described<br>
above and from Lot B and Lot C, which were prepared as follows: Lot B: An emulsion<br>
was created as for Lot A, except that the polymer was provided from a different<br>
commercial source. The resulting emulsion was spray dried at a flow rate of 200<br>
mL/min with an outlet temperature of 12 °C on a custom spray dryer with a drying<br>
chamber. Lot C: An emulsion was created in the same manner as for Lot B, except that<br>
the resulting emulsion was spray dried at a flow rate of 150 mL/min. Table A below<br>
provides information describing the spray drying conditions and bulk microspheres<br>
made thereby.<br><br>
Example 1: Jet Milling of PLGA Microspheres/Excipienr Blend<br>
(Made by Dry/Dry Two-Step Blending)<br>
Blending was conducted in two dry steps. In the first step, 5.46 g of mannitol<br>
and 0.16 g of Tween80 were added into a 125 mL glass jar. The jar was then set in the<br>
TURBULA™ mixer for 15 minutes at 46 min-1. In the second step, 3.9 g of PLGA<br>
microspheres were added into the glass jar containing the blended mannitol and<br>
Tween80. The jar was then set in the TURBULA™ mixer for 30 minutes at 46 min-1.<br><br>
A dry blended powder was produced. The dry blended powder was then fed manually<br>
into a jet mill for particle deagglomeration. Three sets of operating conditions for the<br>
jet mill were used, as described in Table 1.<br><br>
The resulting jet milled samples were analyzed for particle size. For comparison, a<br>
representative sample of mannitol (pre blending and jet milling), and a control sample<br>
(blended but not jet milled) were analyzed. The Coulter Multisizer II results are shown<br>
in Table 2.<br><br>
By comparing the data of the control sample and jet milled.samples, it can be inferred<br>
that the jet milling provides significant particle deagglomeralion. As the grinding air<br>
pressure was increased, Xn stayed nearly constant, but Xv decreased.<br>
Example 2: Jet Milling of PLGA Microspheres/Excipient Blend<br>
Made by Wet/Dry Two-Step Blending<br>
Blending was conducted in two steps: one wet and one dry. In the first, step,<br>
mannitol and Tween80 were blended in liquid form. A 500 mL quantity of<br>
Tween80/mannitol vehicle was prepared from TweenSO, mannitol, and water. The<br>
vehicle had concentrations of 0.16 % Tween80 and 54.6 mg/mL mannitol. The vehicle<br>
was transferred into a 1200 mL Virtis glass jar and then frozen'with liquid nitrogen.<br>
The vehicle was frozen as a shell aTound the inside of the jar in 3.0 minutes, and then<br>
subjected to vacuum drying in a Virtis dryer (model: FreezeMobile 8EL) at 31 mTorr<br><br>
for 115 hours. At the end of vacuum drying, the vehicle was in the form of a powder,<br>
believed to be the Tween80 homogeneously dispersed with the mannitol. In the second<br>
step, 3.9 g of PLGA microspheres were added into the glass jar containing (the blended<br>
mannitol and TweenSO. The jar was then set in the TURBUL.A™ mixer for 30 minutes<br>
at 46 min-1 A dry blended powder was produced. The dry blended powdet was then<br>
fed manually into a jet mill for particle deagglomeration. Three sets of operating<br>
conditions for the jet mill were used, as described in Table 3.<br><br>
The resulting jet milled samples were analyzed for particle size. For comparison, a<br>
control sample (blended but not jet milled) was similarly analyzed. The Coulter<br>
Multisi/er II results are shown in Table 4.<br>
Again, by comparing the data of the control sample and jet milled samples, it can be<br>
inferred that the jet milling provides significant panicle deagglomcration.<br>
Example 3: Jet Milling of PLGA Microsphercs/Excipient Blend<br>
Made by One-Step Dry Blending<br>
In an attempt to reduce the blending time even further, a single blending step<br>
was tested. First, 5.46 g of mannitol was added into a 125 mL glass jar. Then 0.16 g of<br>
Tween80 and 3.9 g of PLGA microspheres were added iuto the jar. The jar was then<br>
set in the TURBULA™ mixer for 30 minutes at 46 min-1. A dry blended powder was<br>
produced. The dry blended powder was fed manually into a jet mill for particle<br>
deagglomeration. Three sets of operating conditions for the jet mill were used, as<br>
described in Table 5.<br><br>
The resulting jet milled samples were analyzed for particle size. For comparison, a<br>
control sample (blended but not jet milled) was similarly analyzed. The Coulter<br>
Multisizer II values are shown in Table 6.<br><br>
Again, by comparing the data of the control sample and jet milled samples, it can be<br>
inferred that the jet milling provides significant particle deagglomcration.<br>
Example 4: Jet Milling of PLGA Microspheres/Excipient Blend<br>
(Made by One-Step Dry Blending - Higher Speed)<br>
In an attempt to reduce the blending time even further, a single blending step<br>
was tested using an increased blending speed for the TURBULA™ mixer as compared<br>
to the speed used in Example 3. First, 5.46 g of mannitol was added into a 125 mL<br>
glass jar. Then 0.16 g of Tween80 and 3.9 g of PLGA microspheres were added into<br>
the jar. The jar was then set in the TURBULA™ mixer for 30 minutes, with the<br>
blending speed was set at 96 min-1. A dry blended powder was produced. The dry<br>
blended powder was fed manually into a jet mill for panicle deagglomeration. Three<br>
sets of operating conditions for the jet mill were used, as described in Table 7.<br><br>
The resulting jet milled samples were analyzed for particle size. For comparison, a<br>
control sample (blended but not jet milled) was similarly analyzed. The Coulter<br>
Mulrisizer II results are shown in Table S.<br><br><br>
Again, by comparing the data of the control sample and jet milled samples, it can be<br>
inferred that the jet milling provides significant particle deagglomeration.<br>
Example 5: Effect of Jet Milling on Microsphere Residual Moisture Level<br>
and Microsphere Morphology<br>
Moisture content of PLGA microspheres was measured by Karl Fischer<br>
titration, before and after jet milling. A Brinkman Metrohm 701 KF Titrinio titrator<br>
was used, with chloroform-methanol (70:30) as the solvent and Hydranl-Componsite 1<br>
as the titrant. The PLGA microspheres all were produced by spray drying as described<br>
in the introduction portion of the examples, and then jet milled using the conditions<br>
shown in Table 9. The grinding pressure was provided by ambient nitrogen at a<br>
temperature of approximately 18 to 20 °C. The results are shown in Table 10.<br><br>
The data in Table 10 show that a substantial reduction in moisture level occurred.<br>
Because moisture levels in excess of 10% can render the powder formulation unstable<br>
and not easily handled, jet milling appears to provide a highly useful and unexpected<br>
ancillary benefit. That is, along with the deagglomeration, jet milling converted the<br><br>
material into one that is more useable, more stable, and more easily handled.<br>
FIGS. 3A-B show SEM images taken before and after jet milling (3.6 bar<br>
injection pressure, 3.1 bar grinding pressure, sample 5.1 from Table 9), which indicate<br>
that the microsphere morphology remains intact. In particular, FIG. 3 A is an SEM of<br>
pre-milled microspheres, which clearly shows aggregates of individual particles, while<br>
FIG. 3B is an SEM of post-milled microspheres, which do not exhibit similar<br>
aggregated: clumps. In addition, the overall microsphere structure remains intact, with<br>
no signs of milling or fracturing of individual spheres. This indicates that the jet milling<br>
is deagglomerating or deaggregating the microparticles, and is not actually fracturing<br>
and reducing the size of the individual microparticles.<br>
Example 6: Effect of Jet Milling on Blend Residual Moisture Level<br>
Blends were prepared as described in Example 1, and moisture levels were<br>
measured as described in Example 5. Table 11 shows the moisture level of the dry<br>
blend of microspheres (Lot A), mannitol, and TweenSO, as measured before jet milling<br>
(control) and after jet milling, with grinding gas at a temperature of 24 °C.<br><br>
The results demonstrate that the moisture content of the dry blended material was<br>
reduced by jet milling, by about 80%. Increasing the grinding pressures did not<br>
significantly decrease the moisture content further.<br>
Example 7: Effect of Jet Milling on Residual Organic Solvent Level.<br>
Residual methylene chloride content of PLGA microspheres was measured by<br>
gas chromatography before blending and jet milling and then after jet milling.. The<br>
porous PLGA microspheres (from Lot A described in Example 1) were blended with<br>
mannitol at 46 rpm for 30 minutes and then jet milled (injection pressure 3.9 bar,<br>
grinding pressure 3.0 bar, and air temperature 24 °C). The assay was run on a Hewlett<br>
Packard model 5890 gas chromatograph equipped with a head space autosampler and<br><br>
an electron capture detector. The column used was a DBWa as column (30 m x 0.25 mm<br>
ED, 0.5 µm film thickness). Samples were weighed into a head space vial, which was<br>
then heated to 40 °C. The head space gas was transferred to the column at a column<br>
flowrate of 5 mL min, and then subjected to a 40 °C to 180 °C thermal gradient. The<br>
results are shown in Table 12.<br><br>
The results demonstrate that a substantial reduction in the level of residual methylene<br>
chloride can be achieved by jet milling the microparticle dry blend formulations.<br>
