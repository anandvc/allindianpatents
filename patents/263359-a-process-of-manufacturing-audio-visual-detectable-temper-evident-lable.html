1.   TITLE OF THE INVENTION		<br>
"Audio/Visual    detectable    and    tamper    evident	label    stock	for<br>
authentication" and the method of manufacturing the	same.	<br>
2.  APPLICANTS		<br>
(a) Name       :  PRS Solutions Private Limited		<br>
(b) Nationality :  Indian		<br>

India		<br>
The following specification particularly describes the	invention and the<br>
manner in which it is to be performed		<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to "Audio/Visual detectable and tamper evident label stock for authentication" and the process of manufacturing the same. It is a heat destructible, solvent destructible label stock which cannot be tampered by any mechanical and /or chemical means without leaving evidence of tampering and is additionally detectable by means of an audio signal / indication as well as visual signal / indication when checked with non-contact special device/s helping to identify and/or verify the authenticity of the seal. Audio/Visual detectable and tamper evident label stock for authentication is designed for security labels with dual function of detecting authenticity of seal as well as tampering.<br>
The product of this invention provides to a manufacturer and/or an end customer with the advantage of 'seal of genuineness' of the product for enabling him to protect the value of his brand/product /franchise and prevent the fraudsters and counterfeiters from illegal, unauthorized and unintended use of the product. The product of this invention also helps to maintain the reputation and goodwill attached to the products / brands.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART<br>
Pressure sensitive adhesive labels are most commonly used as tamper evident seals for brand protection and authentication as they are convenient to produce at a lesser cost as compared to other authentication devices. Such seals are available in the form of printed labels and are commonly made using holograms, low strength security papers which would come off in bits and pieces when attempted to be<br><br><br>
removed from the substrate. Technology involved to make these labels to work also as a means for authentication includes a) printing with security inks which are visible only under specified light source such as ultraviolet or infrared radiations, b) printing with hidden messages readable only with the aid of certain specified devices, c) printing with inks changing colour with change of viewing angle or with application of heat, d) provision of watermarks, fluorescent fibers, barcodes etc. However, low strength security paper based labels as well as those using holographic films could be easily removed without leaving evidence of tampering by the application of heat, commonly available solvents and/or use of sharp tools which cuts the adhesive layer without destructing the paper or film substrates.<br>
All these drawbacks necessitated the usage of label which would be tamper evident, destruct on exposure to heat, destructible with the aforementioned common liquids at the same time should be easily dispensable to allow easy application.<br>
A 'heat sensitive, solvent sensitive, tamper evident, multi purpose security label' provides the much desired properties of tamper evidence as the labels made do not come out in a single piece once properly adhered to any substrate by any means of tampering such as use of heat, solvent, sharp tools etc. The labels made out of stocks can serve the dual function of 'tamper evidence' and 'authentication' when printed with security inks visible under ultraviolet and/or infrared radiations, hidden messages readable with special devices, colour changing inks, watermarks, barcodes etc. and/or laminated with holographic films. However, such means of authentication is only possible by visual aids and sometime by change of angle of the object on which such label is adhered to. In practical industrial applications,<br><br><br>
such as utility meter seals, situations always do not support such requirements of visual detection under specified light and/or angle.<br>
Labels currently used for authentication by non contact detectors include Bar codes or Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology. Bar codes are in widespread use as a means carrying information on management of articles in marketing, distribution, and production processes. A bar code containing encoded information is placed on the object which may be read by use of a bar code reader or scanner which uses an optical method to read the bar code. The bar code reader illuminates the symbol and senses light reflected from the regions of differing light reflectivity to detect the relative widths and spacing of the regions and derive the encoded information. For effective use of bar code labels it is very essential to ensure that reader is placed exactly on the bar code.<br>
Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is being used increasingly as a means to identify goods at a distance, without requiring physical contact or even line of sight access to the goods. A typical RFID system has a passive label having circuitry printed therein and a separate RFID reader. The label transmits encoded data on a selected frequency and the Radio Frequency signals generated by these labels can be read at a short distance from the receiving deivce. The data is then transmitted to a host computer for processing. One advantage of RFID labels is that line of sight is no longer required to read the label. Using radio frequencies enables these labels to be read even when line of sight is not present between the label and the reader. However, RFID labels are costly as they use expensive inks and require specialized devices and computers to read and interpret the signal.<br><br><br>
One of the objectives of the present invention is to develop a label stock which provides an evidence of tampering when removed or attempted to remove from any adhered substrate by use of heat, solvent and/or mechanical means.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to develop a label stock which can be printed with security inks and/or laminated with holographic films to provide evidence of authenticity when checked under specified light source and/or angle.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to develop a label stock which can be used for making seals having tamper evidence features and at the same time facilitates the verification of authenticity without additional step of printing by means of audible sound from a reasonable distance by use of special devices in a cost effective manner.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the process of manufacturing of audio/visual detectable and tamper evident label stock suitable for making printed labels which can be used as 'seal of genuineness' by brand owners to prevent counterfeiting and loss of revenue. The label stock disclosed in the present invention is destructible with heat and solvent and is fragile enough to prevent removal in single piece by use of any sharp tool, and generates a sound by reflecting back invisible radiations to a laserlR generating device. This label stock is print-receptive and can be easily printed with water based printing inks, invisible and other security inks available in the market and/or with serial numbers and bar codes for further security.<br><br><br>
The present invention describes the process of manufacturing "Audio/Visual detectable and tamper evident label stock for authentication" which can be used for making both tamper evident labels and authentication seals without use of any printing step and can be either (I) transparent or (II) opaque/coloured/metallic luster such as Silver, Bronze etc.<br>
(I) In one of the preferred embodiment of manufacturing transparent label stock (Figure 1), the following steps are involved:<br>
(a)	blending of thermoplastic Acrylic polymer with a vinylic<br>
copolymer in ratios of 10:3 to 10:1 and aromatic solvent<br>
to form a paste;<br>
(b)	mixing of pigments which are capable of converting particular wavelengths of Infra red radiations to wavelength in the visible region of specified colour such as Green and also generating a sound by reflecting back invisible radiations to a laserlR generating device in the paste obtained above;<br>
(c)	coating of the said paste obtained in (b) above on a double sided silicone resin coated substrate by conventional method of coating followed by drying using conventional drying equipment to form a film of uniform thickness preferably in the range of 60 to 120 microns;<br>
(d)	coating of a rubber based high tack adhesive on another double sided silicone resin coated substrate followed by drying using conventional coating and drying equipment and lamination of adhesive coated substrate with the film obtained in step (c) above to convert the film into a self-<br><br><br>
adhesive label stock form and removal of double sided<br>
   silicone resin coated substrate on which the said film was<br>
  formed in  step  (c)  above  by rewinding on  mechanical<br>
  rewinders     to  get audio/visual  detectable  and  tamper<br>
         evident label stock branded as SURETUNE;<br>
[II]    In another possible embodiment of manufacturing opaque /<br>
 coloured / metallic luster label stock (Figure 2), the following steps<br>
are involved:<br>
a)	blending of combination of thermoplastic Acrylic polymer with a vinylic copolymer in ratios of 10:3 to 10:1 and aromatic solvent to form a paste;<br>
b)	blending of suitable quantity of pigment such as Titanium-dioxide, Aluminium powder, pearlescent pigments, Titanium -dioxide or Tin oxide coated mica flakes etc. either alone or in combination in the paste obtained above;<br>
c)	mixing of pigments which are capable of converting particular wavelength of Infra red radiations to a wavelength in the visible region of specified colour such as Green and also generating a sound by reflecting back invisible radiations to a laserlR generating device in the paste obtained above;<br>
d)	coating of the said paste obtained in (c) above on a double sided silicone resin coated substrate by conventional method of coating equipment followed by drying using conventional drying equipment to form a film of uniform thickness preferably in the range of 80 to 115 microns;<br>
e)	coating of a rubber based high tack adhesive on a double sided silicone resin coated substrate followed by drying of the adhesive by use of conventional coating and drying equipment and lamination of adhesive coated substrate with film obtained in step (d) above to convert the film into a self-adhesive label<br><br><br>
stock form and removal of double sided silicone resin coated substrate on which film was formed in step (d) above by rewinding on mechanical rewinders to get audio/visual detectable and tamper evident label stock for authentication branded as SURETUNE.<br>
The film formed by this invention has a special property of being strong enough to facilitate dispensing in its final (label) form at the same time strength low enough to prevent its removal from the substrate without tearing in the end product form.<br>
The pigments used to incorporate the audio detecting properties are inorganic pigments and have the capability of converting radiations of specific wavelengths generated by laserlR generating devices into the wavelengths in the visible region of specified colour such as Green, and which when captured through a special device generates output of very low voltage current. These currents then get amplified and are directed to a audio generating device such as a speaker to produce audible sound. The preferred loading of pigment may be in the range of 0.1 to 10 percent of the film weight The distance of detection depends on the concentration of pigment loading i.e. higher the loading longer the range in which sound can be detected<br>
The high tack rubber based adhesive used in the present invention is manufactured by blending various materials including but not limited to natural and/or synthetic rubbers, tackifying resins of natural/synthetic type, pigments, antioxidants etc. This blend is then dispersed in solvents such as hydrocarbon/ aromatic solvents to form a compound of proper consistency to facilitate coating and texture commensurate to the coating equipment. This high tack adhesive of<br><br><br>
the present invention includes a tackifier which can be formed of hydrocarbon resins, rosin and rosin derivatives, polyterpenes, coumarone-indene resins, any compatible conventional tackifier or mixtures thereof and mineral oils which are used as plastisizers.<br>
The high tack rubber based adhesive in this invention is formulated using above components and in suitable ratio so as to give a peel adhesion higher than the breaking strength of the film on which it is coated and is capable of adhering to regular substrates as well as low energy surfaces like polypropylene, polyethylene etc.<br>
The material used for the double sided silicone resin coated substrate could be papers like Glassine, Kraft, polycoated papers or polymeric films like Polyester, Polyethylene, Polypropylene.<br>
The "Audio/Visual detectable and tamper evident label stock for authentication" thus obtained is utilized as the base material for making the audio detectable temper evident labels. For achieving this, audio detectable tamper evident multi purpose label stock for authentication (SURTUNE) is slit in to desired length and width by conventional slitting methods.<br>
