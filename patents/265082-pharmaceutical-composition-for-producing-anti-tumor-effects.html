				<td>Field of the invention<br>
The present invention is related to the field of biotechnology, the pharmaceutical industry and in particular with the production of a composition capable of inhibit the growth of tumoral cells. This composition contains polypeptides fragments from Serralisins, obtained from the degradation of the intact protein, which have a higher antiproliferative activity that the whole serralisin molecules. Said fragments belong to the C-terminal of the serralisins, from the internal metionine of the sequence to the end of the molecule, and the combination of the same with prodigiosins enhance the anti-tumoral effect of this composition. Prior art<br>
Cancer chemotherapy has been traditionally directed to the inhibition of cancer cells proliferation. Nevertheless, in the last years the interest in antitumoral products that induce apoptosis, has increase because cancer has been establish as a pathology related to a relative deficiency in apoptosis, instead of an excess of proliferation.<br>
Bacteria or their extracts have been used for cancer treatment for almost 100 years. The must quoted report is from the physician and surgeon William B. Coley from the Memorial Hospital in New Cork city call Sloan-Kettering Memorial Hospital. He observed that many of his patient with several types of cancer experience tumor regression after been infected by pathogenic bacteria. (Coley, W. B. 1991 -reprinted from 1893-. Clin. Orthop. 262:3). Resistance to tumors on patients or animals infected was attributed to the concomitant cell mediated antitumoral immunity (Paglia, P. and Guzman, C. A. 1998. Cancer immunol. Immunother. 46:88). The idea that a pathogenic bacterial or protozoan infection could activate cancer regression through the activation of the innate or adaptative immunity has been recently questioned by Hunter et al. (Hunter, C. A., Yu, D., Gee, M., Ngo, C. V., Sevignani, C., Goldschmidt, M., Golovkina, T. V., Evans, S., Lee, W. F. and Thomas-Tekhonenko, A. 2001. J. Immunol. 166:5878). They demonstrated that the tissues infected by T. Gondii produce some soluble antiangiogenic factors that<br><br>
avoid the formation of blood vessels in the tumors, which could be of potential therapeutic interest. This process of formation of new capillaries known as angiogenesis, has became an important focus of attention for the implementation of new therapies for cancer and their metastases. The search for antiangiogenic factors is the foundation of new anticancer therapeutic strategies (Folkman, J. 2003. Seminars in Cancer Biology. 13:159). Recently the use of anaerobic bacteria as chemotherapeutic and selective antivascular agents has resulted in a significative regression of subcutaneous (sc) tumors in mice. This treatment is named combined bacteriolytic therapy (COBALTO) (Dang, L. H., Bettegowda, C., Huso, D.L., Klnzler, K.W. and Vogelstein, B. 2001. Proc Natl Arad Sci USA. 98: 15155). Nevertheless, live bacteria produce important toxicity and collateral reactions that limit their use against human cancer.<br>
In the last years, some reports has appear that indicate that anaerobic bacterias release redox proteins that induce tumor cells apoptosis (Yamada, T., Goto, M., Punj, V., Zaborina, 0. and Chen, M.L. 2002. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 99: 14088; Goto, M., Yamada, T., Kimbara, K., Horner, J., Newcomb, M., Gupta, T.K. and Chakrabarty, A. M. 2003. Mol Microbiol. 47:549). It has been postulated that redox proteins could be included in a group of soluble proteins that were secreted by prokaryotic cells ancestors, and their functions could have been the elimination of ancestral eukaryotic cells (Punj, V. and Chakrabarty, A. M. 2003. Cellular Microbiology. 5:225). In general little is known about the production of soluble secreted factors by these prokaryotic organisms that could act in an specific manner on cancer cells, causing their death and concomitantly, the tumor regression. Serratia marcescens is a facultative anaerobic bacteria. From some of its strains some preparations have been obtained with antitumoral properties, the most studied are: [a] ImuVert® (Budagov, R.S. and Ulianova, L.P. 2001. Radiats Biol Radioecol Russian. 41:38), a preparation of ribosomal membranes that activate the patient's immune system; [b] the Serratial protease Mr 56,000 (Wu, J., Akaike, T., Hayashida, K., Okamoto, T., Okuyarna, A. and Maeda, H. 2001. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 92:439), which induce the cells death by necrosis depending on the expression of a-2<br><br>
macroglobuline; and [c] the prodigiosins, a family of pigments that act as immunesupressors and anticancerigens through the induction of apoptosis (Montaner, B and Perez Tomas, R. 2003. Curr Cancer Drug Targets. 3:57; Perez Tomas, R. y Montaner, B. 2003. Histol Histopathol. 18:379). We have obtained non-proteolytic fragments of serralisins with higher cytotoxic activity than the entire molecules. This allows to combine these fragments with low doses of prodigiosine, lowering the toxicity reported for the pigment and increasing the antiproliferative effect on tumoral cells.<br>
Detail description of the invention.<br>
The compositions of this invention are able to inhibit the growth of tumoral cells and are formed by polypeptyde fragments of serralisins, with higher antiproliferative effect than the entire serralisins molecules, which can be combined with prodigiosines that enhance their antitumoral effect. In this invention is described the obtention of the MG2327 preparation, were coexist both polypeptides and prodigiosins, that have a wide spectrum of cytotoxic activity on malignant cell lines, with selective effect on transformed tumoral cells and specifically on cells activated for their growth. The sensibility study on different cell lines, tumoral or not, demonstrate that normal cell lines are only slightly sensitive to the MG2327 preparation, while cells derived from melanoma, laringela carcinoma, fibrosarcomes, hepatocarcinomes and cervico-uterine carcinoma (positive or not for human papilloma virus) are very sensitives. The carcinomas of haematopoyetical origin are less sensitive. HUVEC cells activated for their growth are more sensitive to MG2327 that those no activated. MG2327 preparation is able to act specifically on factor expressed or over expressed during the process of cell division. These factors constitute therapeutical targets against cancer or other diseases of proliferative origins. Furthermore, these factors also constitute targets for the early diagnosis of diseases originated by an excess of proliferation, or by the not controlled proliferation of differentiated or non-differentiated cells. Controlled release formulations containing these molecules could be directed to these proliferating targets acting in a specific manner upon them; because normal cells are more resistant to its action.<br><br>
In order to demonstrate the antitumoral activity of the MG2327 preparation BALB/c mice were challenged with an intraperitoneal inoculation of tumor cells CB Hep.1 of myeloid origin able to cause ascitic murine tumors (Fontirrochi, G., Duenas, M., Fernandez de Cossio, M.E., Fuentes, P., Perez, M., Mainet, D., Ayala, M., Gavilondo, J.V. and Duarte, C.1993. Biotecnol Aplic. 10: 24-30). After 10 days, mice were injected intraperitonealy with MG2327 preparation or PBS. The 60% of the animals treated with 1 mg/kg survived, while only the 25% of the control were alive 45 days after the beginning of the treatment (Fig. 8). Total tumoral regression was observed in the treated survivors, showing a healthy condition, while in the controls, the tumors progress forming big solid masses and mice showed a deterioration of the general condition.<br>
BALB/c mice bearing tumors of myeloid origin treated with one dose of 1 mg/kg of weight of the MG2327 preparation survived with total regression. This same dose increases the survival with a significant reduction of tumor volume in BALB/c mice bearing a tumor originated by E6/E7 transformed fibroblast. MG2327 protect BALB/c mice from the implant of myeloid tumors.<br>
The MG2327 preparation was obtained as a result of the optimization of the culture conditions to produce antiproliferative molecules. MG2327 preparation was obtained as result of the optimization of the culture conditions to produce anti-proliferative moleculas, which constituye one protector agent against the implant and development of maligns tumors, in this manner as inductor of the production of anti-proliferative, apoptotic y anti-angiogenic moleculas in normal and tumors cells, that could be used advantageous in the profilaxis and therapy of the cancer.moreover of other diseases related with this events. CMIB 4202 strain over-express solubles proteins in the range of 45-50 y 20-30 kDa (50 y 25 kDa by SDS-PAGE, with one determination coefficient of 0.984). the fraction of 25 KDa, name as p25, showed a dosis-dependiente potent anti-proliferative activity in the experiment perform with the HEp-2 cellular line incubate with EDTA, while that la 50 KDa fraction name as p50, non inhibit the growing. However, to incube p50 fraction withn 5 uM ZnaSCU showed anti-proliferative activity,but less than potent that p25 fraction, the ICso of the p25 and p50 fractions were 0.48 nM y 16 nM, respectively.<br><br>
The isolated of proteic biomolecules with anti-proliferative effect (polipeptides and prodigiosin)was performed in the present invention, by only one chromatografic step: ionic interchange using a discontinue gradient of NaCI. It used one DEAE o QAE Sepharosa Fast Flow matriz, equilibrate with 50 mM of phosphate buffer, pH 8.00. The elution was performed with one discontinue gradient of NaCI: 50 mM of phosphate buffer -0.1 M NaCI, pH 8.00; 50 mM of phosphate buffer-0.2 M NaCI, pH 8.00; 50 mM -2 M NaCI, pH 8.00 and finally was elute the pigment fraction absorbed to the matrix a la matriz with absolute ethanol to 70 %. The results confirm that proteic component preparation of 25 kDa have highest than capacity that proteic component of 50 kDa of the same preparation, to inhibit the growing of cells tumors, and both present in vitro biologic activity of independent form. Fragments of several molecular size provoked the degradation of p50, that included fragments of 25 kDa. The increased of degradation of p50 was obtained with high temperatura, and the generation of p25 was proportional with this increase of temperature, while that decreased the p50. The anti-p50 policlonals antibody, obtained in sheep, recognized to p25 in Western Blot assay, therefore the p25 fue originate as product of the degradation of the p50 protein. The products of degradation proporcionally increased with antiproliferative activity of products of degradation: This results confirm that the p50 autolisis is able of produce fragments of degradation with antiproliferative activity most potent that original molecule p50 . Moreover the p25 protein also induce total regression of malign tumors of mieloide source. The fragments of p50 can be genetically conjugate, by some already known methodology of antibody fragments and generate inmunotoxins useful to treatment of proliferative etiology disease Also this fragment alone or combined, with other proteic moleculas maybe employe as carrier from inner of celulas orspecififc receptors. The fragment of p50 also can to expose itself to external medium of liberation system adjusted, to maintain a directional control from targets specific.<br>
The proteolitic activity of p50 was inhibit with 7 mM de EDTA.and was demostrate that p50 is a metalloprotease, identified to mass spectrometre, belonging to Serralisins family.<br><br>
, The major similarity was founded in species with identifier PRZN_SERSP and PRZN_SERMA in the data base of Swissprot proteins. p25 protein purify by chromatography non present enzimatic activity and this corespond with the non catalytic of Serralisins carboxil-terminal region<br>
The proteic components and the prodigiosin was formulated in one same composition that increased signicantly (p
Obtention of the composition that containing polipeptidics fragments derivated of the Serralisinas, with increased anti-proliferative effect, with respect to Serralisins integral moleculas, and the Serralisins-Prodigiosinas fragments combination which selectively potent biological activity of the composition. Adicionally, these polipeptidic fragments have apoptotic effect over cancerigenas celulas. This apoptotic effect involved to rnitochondrias, microtubules and DMA, fragmentation amplifying to program celular death signal, used losses doses of this compoisition. This events also were observed with combinated composition of polypeptide and prodigiosin.<br>
Anti-angiogenic effect of MG2327 and anti-proliferative polipeptides fragments were evalute by the method of formation of tubular structure in matrigel.Non citotoxic concentration of MG2327 and their fraction p25 y p50 were incubed with human microvasculature endothelial celulas (HMEC). The final result it evalued considering the tubular structure length formed and the number of interconexion between them. For this used Pro Express 4.5 Image- program. The result confirm that the treatment with MG2327 composition explain that treatment with protein and their antiproliferative polipeptides inhibit of form significative (p
 <br>
Apoptotic, anti-angiogenic activity and the selectivity maintain one of them characteristic most important of the object composition of this invention, by it potential therapeutic and protector against the cancer. The combination of fragments Serralisins and prodigisins family was demonstrated that are most potent and selective that of form independent as cancerigens. These polypeptides can be used in the obtention of recombinat toxins and immunotoxins to the profilaxis and cancer therapies, or others diseases related with proliferation of endothelial and transformed celulas. These polipeptides and it possible combination with prodigiosins are son applied to pharrmaceutica industry to obtention of vacunales preparados, terapeutics or diagnostic of use human or animal against cancer and other patologies of kind proliferative that are highly selective and them have one ample espectrum of action.<br>

Figure 1. The interaction of S. marcescens with tumoral cells CB Hep.1 generates bacterial strains with high antiproliferative capacity and with modified protein expression. A- Cell survival. After 72 hours, cell survival was estimated by the MTT method. The strain CMIB 4202 showed a strong antiproliferative effect on the human tumoral cells HEp-2, while the effect of the SM1995 strain was very weak. These results were the average of tree independent experiments using four replies per sample. B- SDS-PAGE electrophoresis (silver stainning).

Figure 2. Antiproliferative activity of the 25 and 50 kDa fractions on the cell line HEp-2. Cell viability was determined by the MTT method and expressed in percents respect to the control cells. The fractions werew recovered from SDS gels (stained with zinc-imidazol) and renaturalized. The fraction around 25 kDa showed a strong antiproliferative activity (ICso 0.35 nM/mL), while p50 was unable to inhibit the growth. When Zn4SO2 5 uM was added to the p50, an increase in the antiproliferative activity was observed (IC50 45 nM/mL) although inferior to that of the p25. The curves were generated from the mean values of five independent experiments and are plotted with the correspondent standard deviation (SD).<br><br>

EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1.   Obtention of the strain CM IB 4202.<br>
In order to obtain bacterial strains producers of antitumoral molecules, the wild type Serratia Marcescens SM1995 isolated from the ventral surface of BALB/c mice was mixtured with the tumoral cells CBHEp.1 (Aleman, M.R., Valdes, R., Perez, M., Ibarra, N., Reyes, B., Gonzalez, M., Mendoza, O., Padilla. S., Agraz, A. and Rodriguez, M. P. 2000. Biopharm 13:48-52) and were inoculated intraperitonelly in BALB/c mice, previously inoculated 10 days before with heavy liquid petrolate. Eigth days after the inoculation of the cells mixtures, ascitic extractions were performed every 2 days. The kinetics of tumor growth was analyzed and the microbiologycal control was performed to the ascitis of each animal presenting tumor regression. The isolated bacteria were grown in different media and culture conditions. The culture supernatants were steril filtered using membrane filters of 0.22um and their toxicity was evaluated on CBHEp.1 cells. The strain with higher cytotoxicity was deposited with the accession number CMIB4202 in the Collection of Microorganism with Biotechnological Importance of the Center of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Habana city, Cuba. CMIB4202 and its parental strain SM1995, were cultured in parallel in 5L fermenters, in peptone-glycerol media at 28 °C. The steril filtrate of CMIB 4202 evidence a dose dependent activity while the one from SM1995 has only a little activity on the human cancer cell line HEp-2 (Fig.1 A) in the anti-prolifferative assay using the MTT method (Skehan, P., Storeng, R., Scudiero, D., Monks, A., Mcmahon, J., Vistica, D., Warren, J. T., Bokesch, H., Kenney, S. and Boyd, M. R. 1990, J. Natl. Cancer. Inst. 82:1107).<br>
The strain CMIB 4202 over-expressed soluble proteins in the ranges of 45-50 y 20-30 kDa (50 y 25 kDa as determined by SDS-PAGE, with a coefficient of determination of 0.984), Fig. 1B.<br>
The p25 fraction recovered from the bands presented in SDS gels stained with zinc-imidazole (Hardy, E., Santana, H., Sosa, A., Hernandez, L., Fernandez-Padron, C. and Castellanos-Serra, L. 1996. Analytical Biochemistry. 240:150) showed a strong antiproliferative dose dependent activity in HEp-2, while the p50 fraction do not inhibit the cell growth.<br><br>
Nevertheless, when p50 was incubated with 5 uM Zn2SO4 showed antiproliferative activity but lower as the observed for p25 (Fig. 2). The IC5o of the fractions p25 and p50 were 0.48 nM and 16 nM, respectively. With the objective of compare the ability of both strains to express the proteins, a factorial ANOVA was applied. The value of the probability of interaction was not significant (p= 0.93). Furthermore, the probability of both principal effects Por otro lado, la probabilidad de ambos efectos principales mostro que ambas proteinas son expresadas en cantidades significativamente diferentes (P =0.01) y que la cantidad es fuertemente dependiente de la cepa (P =0.0004).

EXAMPLE 3. Characterization of the antiproliferative activity of the MG2327 preparation "in vitro".<br>
For the characterization of the antiproliferative activity of MG2327 "in vitro" a panel of human cell lines was evaluated (table 1). A total of 2000 cells, except for PBMC (20000), were seeded in 96 wells culture wells, and different concentrations of MG2327 were added. After 72 hours, the number of survival cells was estimated by addition of MTT (Skehan, P., Storeng, R., Scudiero, D., Monks, A., Mcmahon, J., Vistica, D., Warren, J. T., Bokesch, H., Kenney, S. and BOYD, M. R. 1990. J Natl Cancer Inst. 82:1107). The soluble formazan products were detected at 540 nm in a multiscan plate reader. MG2327 showed a wide range of cytotoxic activity against the analyzed human cell lines. The IC50 was in the |jg/mL range. Table 1. Cells and culture media used on the "in vitro" study<br><br>

*FBS: Fetal Bovine Serum<br>
MG2327 selectivity was compared to the commertial drug Doxorrubicine (DXR) using the HT1080 cell line (from a fibrosarcoma) and primary fibroblasts. The antiproliferative assay used was described above. Serial dilutions of DXR and of the MG2327 preparation were applied from 10 ug/mL and a five point curve was generated. The mortality ratio was calculated for each point as the relation between the mortality percent for HT1080 and the mortality percent for the primary fibroblasts. The higher differences were detected at the lower concentrations tested (MG2327 9:1, DXR 1.7:1). MG2327 was very selective at concentrations below 2 ug/mL. HEp-2 cells originated from a laryngeal carcinoma are very resistance to the antitumorals used in clinic as compared to the other cell lines analyzed. For this reason, we used it as a model for the "in vitro" studies of the effects of the MG2327 preparation. A comparison of the cytotoxicity curves generated for HEp-2 cells treated with known antitumoral drugs, showed similar results (40 %) of proliferation at 3 ug/mL for MG2327 preparation, Cisplatin (CDDP), Doxorubicine (DXR), Vincristine (VC), Vinvlastine (VB) and Taxol (TX) (p&gt; 0.05, test de ANOVA). In the same conditions other antitumorals like Ara C, Metotrexate (MTC), Bleomicine (Bleo) y Ciclophosfamide (CPA), do not showed effect. CDDP is one of the antitumorals authorized by the FDA for the treatment of laryngeal cancer, and the analysis of the survival curves for MG2327 preparation and CDDP showed similar values for the IC10, ICso and<br>
ICgo<br>
The sensibility study of the different cancerigenas cellular lines o non cancerigenas(Fig. 4) showed that normal cellular lines are little sensity to.whyle that melanoma, carcinoma laringeo, fibrosarcoma, hepatocarcinoma, y carcinomas Cervico-uterinos (carrier of the virus of the humano papiloma virus ), are very sensity. The carcinomas of de origen hematopoyetic source are less sensity. The celulas HUVEC activity to it growing are most sensity to the MG2327preparation that the non activates<br>
The result previous showed that the preparation MG2327 have ample espectrum of citotoxic action over malign celulas lines, with selective effect with effect on tumors/transformed and activate celulas to it growing.<br>
EXAMPLE 4 Antitumor activity of the MG2327 preparation.<br>
To demonstrate the antitumoral activity of the MG2327 preparation we employed BALB/c mice, that were implanted intraperitoneally (i.p.) with CB Hep.1 tumor cells, of myeloid origin, able to give rise to murine ascitic tumors (Fontirrochi, G., Duenas, M., Fernandez de Cossio, M.E., Fuentes, P., Perez, M., Mainet, D., Ayala, M., Gavilondo, J.V. and Duarte, C.1993. Biotecnol Aplic. 10: 24-30), After 10 days, mice were injected i.p. with MG2327 or PBS. Sixty percent of the animals treated with 1 mg/kg of weight survived, while only 25 percent of the controls lived to 45 days after initiated treatment (Fig. 5). Total tumor regression was observed in all treated surviving animals, that showed a healthy state, while in the controls the tumors progressed forming large solid masses, and the animals exhibited a unhealthy general state.<br>
BALB/c mice bearing a tumor of fibroblasts transformed with E6/E7 increased their survival after being treated with the MG2327 preparation, showing a significant reduction of tumor volume.<br>
Also, to evaluate the antitumoral activity of MG232, a model of cancer associated to the human papilloma virus (HPV16) developed by Hernandez et al. (Hernandez, P., Merina, N., Lopez-Ocejo, O. and Arana, M. J. 2000. Biochem Biophys Res Commun.270:119-124) was used. Two groups of BALB/c mice were inoculated subcutaneously (s.c.) with 2x106 3T316 cells in the left ventral zone. After 48 hours, a dose of 0.75 mg/kg of weight of MG2327 or PBS was ministered s.c., near the primary cell inoculation in the control group, daily measurements were done with a caliper. The tumor volume was calculated using the standard formula V= 0.52 x a2 x b , where a is width and b is the length of the horizontal perimeter of the tumor (Hernandez, P., Merina, N., Lopez-Ocejo, O. and Arana, M. J. 2000. Biochem Biophys Res Commun.270:119-124). Behavior is shown in Fig. 6.<br>
The differences in the time of tumor development were statiscally significant (p=0.0054) between the treated and non-treated animals. The study of the relationship time:treatment with the ANOVA test showed that the same magnitude of difference doesn't maintain between the treated and non treated groups; this indicated the existence of a difference related to the treatment applied to the animals.<br>
When a Wilcoxon test was applied for the paired data to the measurements between days 21 and 45 of each group, we detected a significant increase of tumor volume for the control group (p=0.043), not being this the case for the treated group (Fig. 6A). To analyze the existence of significant differences between the groups in each moment of evaluation, we applied a Mann-Whitney U test that detected significant differences, exception made of the first point (p
The mice of the control group died between days 45 and 64 due to the tumor implantation, while the animals in the treated group started to die in day 52, with a 20% survival that maintained in time (170 days), Fig. 6B.<br>
Adjusting the survival data to a Bayesian hierarchy model (Weibull regression with 500 iterations) we obtained a statistically significant difference (p= 0.02447), that was confirmed when it was shown that the confidence intervals for the average survival time were totally exclusive.<br>

The polissacaride fraction (tr = 6.85 min) was separated in Aminex gel HPX 87-N chromatography (dimensiones: 300 x 7.8 mm, flujo: 0.5 ml/min).Was utilized patterns of fructose tr = 13.15 min., glucose tr = 12.12 min., dissacaride tr = 9.40 min., trissacaride tr = 8.24 min., polissacaride tr = 7.01 rnin. The pigment fraction was separated mediated a butilo TSK column of the MERCK equilibrated with phosphate 20 mM, pH=7, where remain retained into matriz, subsequently was elute employment absolute ethanol. Abssortion spectrum (ethanol 100 % a pH 5.00) of the product obtained showed a band with maximum 470 y 490 nm and a maximum peak in 537 nm, that<br>
correspond with characteristic describe of the monomers and dimer of the, respectively, with reported anti-proliferative activity (Perez-Tomas, R. and Montaner, B. 2003 Histol. Histopathol. 18: 379-385; Montaner, B., and Perez Thomas, R. 2003. Curr Cancer Drug Targets. 3:57-65). The polissacaride isolated non showed inhibit effect, while that fraction correspond to prodigiosin showed dose-dependent anti-proliferative activity.<br>

Anti-p50 obtaining in sheep was utilized to know the relation between p25 y p50. MG2327 was to apply to SDS-PAGE gel al 12 % and with a Imidazol-Zinc stanning (Hardy, E., Santana, H., Sosa, A., Hernandez, L, Fernandez-Padron, C. and Castellanos-Serra, L. 1996. Analytical biochemistry. 240:150-152). Aproximately the proteins bands de 50 y 25 kDa, (Fig. 9) were cut, renaturalized in gel and applied to SDS-PAGE. These were transfer to nitrocelulosa membrane and the Western Blot was to realize. The anti-p50 policlonal antibody recognized to p25 and degradation of p50 the sizes moleculares were estimated with marked of prestaining molecular weigh (Bio-Rad).

The proteic fraccions obtained in the chromatography describe in the Example 6 were assay with this method. P50 showed proteolytic activity that was inhibit with 7 mM de EDTA, therefore this result a metaloprotease. p25 no showed enzymatic activity, Fig. 12. The method of the cimogeno using gelatine as sustrate (Vacca, A., lurlaro, M., Ribatti, D., Minischetti, M., Nico, B., Ria, R., Pellegrino, A. and Dammacco, F. 1999. Blood. 94:4143-4155) was employed to verify the proteolytic activity of p50 and p25. Moreover was analized the enzymatic capacity of the degradation of p50. In this assay the protein p50 obtained by the chromatography describe in the Example 6 showed enzymatic activity. The proteic band fraction of the gel to the height of 25 kDa (from MG2327) showed proteolytic activity; whyle that p25 obained by chromatography no showed this activity.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 12. Identification of anti-proliferative polypeptides of 25 kDa from MG2327.<br>
To the identification of proteins with anti-proliferative activity present in the band of 25 kDa, was cleaved the SDS-PAGE gel (describe in thel Example 8) with MG2327 applied. The band was incubed during 5 min en 1 ml of Tris/HCI (100 mM pH 8.5) buffer until that had totally transluced. the band was cleaved in small cube of nearly 1 mm3, absorbing with acetonitrilo, rehydrated in a smallest volume of bicarbonate of ammonium (25 mM) containing trypsin or LEP to a concentrattion of 12.5 ng/uL. The digestion in gel was incubed to 37 °C by 18 h in a thermostatic mingler<br>
The peptides resultants of the LEP digestion was analyzed by MALDI-MS. The monoisotopic ions of the signals most intense was introduced in the Propound program to the identification of the interest protein in the secuency data base Although we no performed none taxonomic restrictcion during the search in the data base , the 50 kDa protease of Serratia marcescens EC 3.4.24.40 was alienable as the of major similitude. Four peptides (51-57, 58-66, 67-80 and 81-90) ownership to the N-terminal region and one (402-409) ownership to C-terminal region of the protein. The molecular size EC 3.4.24.40 delay of the presents in the band analized (nearly 25 kDa, estimated by SDS-PAGE). These finding suggest that the band of 25 kDa contain two fragments co-migrate of 25 kDa with like to protein of 50 kDa EC 3.4.24.40 belonging to Serralisin family.<br>
To confirm this hypotesis, was development of the 25KDa band of the protein.a tryptic digestion. The ESI-MS espectrum of the peptides removed was deconvolute and the signals most intensity were introduced in the Profound program The way out showed the same protein previously identify (EC 3.4.24.40).The sequence cover of the tryptic digestion (21 %) was major that the before digestion (10 %). The sequence cover map proved seven peptides that que coincided very good with some of the tryptic fragments PRZN_SERMA/PRZN_SERSP of the proteins. Five of them (28-41, 58-66, 67-80, 81-90 and 163-171) corresponded to the N-terminal region, while that the remainder two peptide (351-373 and 374-393) correspond to the C-terminal region These results not only corroborate the prior identification of<br><br>
the protein, but that the map cover suggest the presence of two co-migrates fragments of 25 kDa of the identify protein as PRZN_SERMA/PRZN_SERSP, in the analized.band<br>
The ESI-MS/MS espectrum correspond to peptides of the N- y C-terminal regions of the previously mentioned proteins were explained handly and the parcials sequences were removed by its identification, Table 3.<br>

The methods employed and results obtained we concluded that in the 25 kDa band analized exist one mixture of proteins that have fragments with similitude PRZN_SERMA/PRZN_SERSP of the proteins N and C-terminal.<br>
EXAMPLE 13. Identification of the p50.<br>
To identify the protein p50 with anti-proliferative activity, the proteic fraction correspond to the 50 kDa protein obtained of the protocol of purification describe in the Example 6 ,was digested with Lys-C endoproteinase. The identification of the peptides was performed by means of sequenciation by automatized Edman Degradacion and a JMS HX- 110 doble sector masses spectrometre, with FAB cannon. These results and the aligned realized by el Swissprot and PIR software was concluded that such protein to means of to<br>
Serralisin's family with 50 kDa molecular weight The major similitude was found to the species with PRZN_SERSP y PRZN_SERMA identificators in the Swissprot bank. The molecular mass of all peptides analized by mass spectrometer coincided with the expect teorics amount to peptides of these digesting proteins with Lys-C endoproteinase.<br>
EXAMPLE 14. Identification of the purified p25 by chromatography. To identify the 25 kDa protein with anti-proliferative,apoptotic and anti-angiogenic activity, the purified p25 by DEAE chromatography describe in the Example 6 was applied to SDS-PAGE. The proteina band was washed during five minutes with 500 uL of water.after was off colour with a citric acid solution 100 mM, subsequently was newly washed with MilliQ water, cut in small cube aproximately of 1 mm3. After, it addition acetonitrilo until it's deshidratation and excess was eliminated. The gel cubes were dehydrated totally in a evaporative centrifuge and subsequently rehydrated in a amonium bicarbonate solution (50 mM) that contained trypsin to a concentration of 12.5 ng/uL After were incubed in a mingler thermostated during 30 minutes to 37 °C overnight<br>
The peptides were passively avoid to add 20 uL of an amonium bicarbonate solution and additional incubation to 37 °C during 45 minutes. The peptides were removed by the use of ZipTipc-is ™ and subsequently it acidulous the mixture reaction to add 5 |jL of free formic acid and was removed newly the peptides by the used of the ZipTipcis ™. The peptides adherent to the ZipTipci8 ™ were whased constantly with a de formic acid solution to 5 % and subsequently avoid in a volume de 2-3 uL of a 60 % acetonitrilo solucion that contained a 1 %.formic acid<br>
The peptide created during the digestion were loaded in ones borosilicate capillars needles cover in gold introducing in the ionization fountain of the ortogonal geometric hibrido mass espectrometre equipment with a (QTOF-2™) nanospray fountain.<br>
ESI-MS mass spectrum were adquired in a range 350-2000 Da during 1 second. The signals most intense were selected to it's posterior ESI-MSMS sequence The collision gas employee was the argon and it used a collision<br>
energy appropriate to produce a extensive fragmentation of the peptides selected, that will allow it identification unequivocal in the data bases. The ESI-MS espectum were deconvoluted and exported in a DTA format and import in the MASCOT programa to the identification of the protein in SWISSPROT and NCBInr data bases mediate the stategy of the Peptide Mass Fingerprint (PMF). To an exact identification of the protein it used a calibration inward to employe a peptide autoproteolitic of the trypsin and it fixed an error of 0.05 Da, to realice search of the peptides observed in the spectrum and it selected those signals that had an greater intensity to 10 % of the intensity of the base peak.<br>
Four peptides presents in the band analized were sequenced by ESI-MSMS (Tabla 4). These peptides PRZN_SERMA/PRZN_SERSP of the proteins concerning to the C-terminal region (indicate in red in the sequency of Table 6), previously identified in the anterior Examples.<br>

EXAMPLE 16. MG2327-induced apoptosis.<br>
MG2327 induces apoptosis on mieloma X63 cells, involving fragmented DNA<br>
and including mitochondria and microtubules.<br>
For determining the kind of tumoral cell death, murine mieloma P3X63Ag8<br>
cells (2*107) were treated in vitro with MG2327 at 22 ug/mL Treated and<br>
untreated   cells   were   prepared   for   ultrastructural   transmission   electron<br>
microscopy studies at different times, and genomic DNA was extracted for<br>
DNA laddering assay.<br>
DNA fragmentation was assessed  by 2 % agarose gel electrophoresis.<br>
Apoptosis   frequently   involves   cellular   DNA   laddering   of   180-200   bp,<br>
representative of inter-nucleosomal distances (Soldatenkov, V. A., Prasad, S.,<br>
Voloshin, Y,, and Dritschilo, A. 1998. Cell Death Differ. 5:307-12). As shown<br><br>
in  figure  13,  a  significant increase was observed  of oligonucleosomes,<br>
correlated to morphological changes in culture and corroborated by electron<br>
microscopy<br>
Inter-nucleosomal fragmentation was preceded by morphological signs of<br>
apoptosis detected by optical microscopy. Moreover, micrographs showed a<br>
altered citoplasmic organelles (mitochondrion, 2h), also preceding chromatin<br>
condensation (4h) and internucleosomal fragmentation (6h).<br>
MG2327 affects microtubules and the ultrastructural organization of mitochondria, increasing P3X63Ag8 cells' apoptosis.<br>
Untreated cells showed a typical mitochondrial ultrastructure: clearly visible mitochondrial cristae and a mitochondrial matrix of higher density, evenly distributed all over the cytoplasm (Fig. 14A).<br>
Cells treated with MG2327 showed increased size mitochondria, a lower matriz density and heavily affected cristae morphology (Fig. 14B-E). These ultrastructural changes mostly indicate disfunctional organelles.<br>
Moreover, we observed extensive cytoplasmic vacuoles, also regarding the endoplasmic reticulum as mitochondria and nuclear structure, 2 hrs after treatment (Fig. 14B).<br>
Different morphological changes were observed in the nuclei at 6 hr treatment (chromatin condensing, merging and laddering). In the late phase apoptosis micrograph (8 hr) of P3X63Ag8 cells treated with MG2327, chromatin appeared compact (Fig. 14F). Budding was not detected at any time.<br>
Interestingly, mitochondria on P3X63Ag8 cells treated for 2 hr were clustered at cytoplasmic membrane periphery (Fig. 14B-E), resulting from microtubule disruption and interfered mitochondria transport along this organelle. (Schatten'<br>
H., and Lewis, M.L. 2001   Acta Astronaut. 49:399-418Figures 14C and D show greater mitochondria, also bearing condensed structures attached to the inner mitochondrial membranes. These structures would have been generated by successive cristae fusion. MG2327 could generate apoptosis by cytochrome c release into the cytosol after mitochondrial outer membrane swelling while increasing in size, followed by caspase activation and apoptosis (Green, D.R. and Reed, J.C. 1998. Science.<br><br>
28:1309-1312. Review).<br>
Without increasing in size, cytochrome c could also be completely and quickly released from damaged cristae of the mitochondrion to the cytosol, through junctions between the intermembrane space and cristae after fusion (Scorrano, L., Ashiya, M., Buttle, K., Weiler, S., Oakes, S.A., Mannella, C.A. and Korsmeyer, S.J. 2002. Dev Cell. 2:55-67). The process described significantly amplified apoptosis signals generated by MG2327 into cells.<br>
Example 17. P25 and P50 induce apoptosic<br>
To discern the role of p25 and p50 in the apoptotic events induced by MG2327, they were individually administered to P3X63Ag8 cells at different concentrations and analized by electron microscopy. In all cases, chromatin condensing, damaged mitrocondria cristae and clustered mitocondria were detected. Indeed, apoptosis induction by MG2327 is linked to the effect of these two proteins.<br>

Development of tubular structures in mathgel<br>
Human micro-vasculature-derived human endotelial cells (HMEC) were assessed for endothelial cord formation on matrigel (Crum R, Szabo S, Folkman J. 1985. Science. 230:1375-8; Vacca, A., Ribatti, D., Presta, M., Minischettti, M., lurlaro, M, Ria, R, Albini, A, Bussolino, F. and Dammaacco, F. 1999. Blood 93:3064) after culture under non-cytotoxic MG2327 and p25 and p50 concentrations (Sanz, L., Pascual, M., Munoz, A., Gonzalez, M.A., Salvador CH, Alvarez-Vallina L. 2002. Microvascular Research 63:335-339). Results considered the length of tubular structures and the number of interconnections between them, as calculated by using the Image-Pro Express 4.5 package. They indicated a significant inhibition (p
Example 19. Indirect effect of MG2327 on proliferating cells.<br><br>
MG2327 protects Balb/c mice from myeloid tumor implants.<br>
For analyzing the protective activity of MG2327 against implanted tumors, Balb/c mice were inoculated (i.p.) with 1 mg/ml of this antitumoral preparation under different immunization schedules. Three doses were administered, one dose every week, and two doses every week during three weeks with at least three days between doses. A negative control group was inoculated with 1X PBS. Two millions of P3X63Ag8 myeloma cells were inoculated i.p. to the experimental groups (treated and control) 150 days after the first dose (5 months after). All mice from the negative control group died during the first 25 days, meanwhile 100% of the treated animals survived without tumors. (Fig. 16).<br>
EXAMPLE 20 The C-terminal domain of other Serralisins has also cytotoxic effect, without proteolytic activity.<br>
The ATCC14756 strain was cultivated under similar conditions as the CMIB4202 strain according to Example 2 and its culture supernatants were processed as described in Example 6. In both preparations we observed proteins at the levels of 50 kDa that eluted with 50 mM phosphate-0.2 M NaCI, pH 8.00. These proteins showed enzymatic activity that was inhibited with 10 mM of EDTA and recovered with 5 uM Zn2SO4. Both proteins were digested chemically with CNBr and the digestion pattern was similar, generating similar fragments of approximately 25 kDa, corresponding to the C-terminus of p50, from the internal methionine in the sequence to the end of the molecule.<br>
The fragments obtained from the digestion were renatured with a change in buffer through dialysis for 48 hours. The biological activity of these fragments was tested in the cytotoxicity assay described here, using HEp.2 cells that were incubated for 72 hours in their presence. The fragments produced by the digestion, and lacking proteolytic activity, in the presence of 5 mM EDTA, presented a higher cytotoxic activity that was dose-dependent, approximately 2.5 times over that of the complete p50 molecule. These fragments, once their<br><br>
sequences are known, can also be obtained by chemical synthesis or by recombination techniques.<br>
EXAMPLE 21 Combination of fragments of Serralisins with antibodies or antibody fragments.<br>
The polypeptidic fragments obtained in Examples 6 and 20 were chemically conjugated with the monoclonal antibody CB/ior-CEA.1 (Tormo B et al. APMIS 97:1073-1080,1989), with its variable regions, and with the antibody fragment obtained via recombinant DNA technology from its sequence (diabody) (patent WO 03/093315). The conjugated biomolecules were assayed on the human tumor cell lines LoVo (ATCC CCL-229), AsPC-1 (ATCC CRL-1682) and LS 174T (ATCC CL-188), all expressing CEA in culture, through an anti-proliferation assays similar to the one described in Example 3. The conjugated fragments were used at cytotoxic concentrations equivalent to those of un-conjugated fragments, with a dose-dependent response, while with the un-conjugated molecules no anti-proliferation response was observed. It was shown that the conjugated fragments were bound to CEA on the cells, using procedures as cell-ELISA, and indirect immunofluorescence (patent WO 03/093315). These results demonstrate that the conjugates described here can be used for the therapy and diagnosis of cancer.<br>
