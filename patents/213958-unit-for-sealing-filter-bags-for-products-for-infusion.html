				<td>UNIT FOR SEALING FILTER BAGS FOR PRODUCTS FOR INFUSION<br>
Technical field<br>
The present invention relates in general to unit for sealing filter bags for products for infusion<br>
and in particular to an ultrasound unit for sealing lengths of filter paper.<br>
We refer in particular to the sealing process performed in machines for making filter bags or<br>
sachets containing a product for infusion such as tea, camomile and the like.<br>
Background Art<br>
Prior art machines for making filter bags from a web of filter paper comprise a plurality of<br>
stations, including a station for feeding a web of filter paper, a folding station and a first station for<br>
longitudinally sealing the folded web to form a continuous tubular wrapping of filter paper and<br>
preferably for transversally sealing the continuous tubular wrapping to form a succession of filter bags<br>
of substantially flattened shape.<br>
The longitudinal and transversal sealing station comprises a specially shaped upper roller with<br>
tracks for longitudinally and transversally sealing the continuous tubular wrapping of filter paper. The<br>
seals may be made by heat sealing means or, in the solutions of the latest generation, by sonotrodes,<br>
positioned in contact with the product to be sealed.<br>
In practice, the sonotrode is the transducer element that converts the power supply into<br>
vibrations that are discharged onto the product to be sealed.<br>
Current sealing units based on sonotrodes usually comprise a pair of sonotrodes placed side by<br>
side to enable both seals to be made. The sonotrodes are positioned so that they face the roller and are<br>
mounted on a rigid structure so as to keep the gap between each sonotrode and the filter paper as<br>
constant as possible.<br>
Indeed, the applicant has found that the relative position between the<br>
emitting surface of the sonotrode and the product <br>
supporting surface constitutes a fundamental variable for good sealing quality.<br>
Current sealing units based on sonotrodes, however, involve highly rigid systems of supports<br>
with a multiplicity of sensors and devices for controlling the force applied to the sonotrodes which<br>
make it extremely difficult to keep this relative position firm and constant.<br>
Indeed, the system is unsuitable for very thin materials such as filter paper since the rigidity of<br>
the supports and the high number of external control variables for maintaining the distance between<br>
the sonotrode and the product create vibrations resulting in distances that are larger than acceptable<br>
for a good quality" seal and slowing down sealing operations themselves on account of control and<br>
feedback between the sonotrodes and the control systems.<br>
In this context, references are made to DE 19536881, US 6592711, JP 2004123150 which do<br>
not disclose that the sealing sonotrode means are arranged in sealing position under the roller. By<br>
contrast, DE 19536881 and US 6592711 disclose that the sealing sonotrode means are arranged in<br>
sealing position over the roller, whilst JP 2004123150 discloses that the sealing sonotrode means are<br>
arranged in sealing position on the side of the roller.<br>
The feature of positioning the sonotrode means under the roller , as suggested by the present<br>
invention, solves the objective technical problem of providing a more stable working of the machine,<br>
since, the weight of the sonotrode means aims to maintain the sonotrodes away from the roller<br>
(downwards), so avoiding accidental and undesired shocks between the sonotrode means and the<br>
roller (for example, due to vibration of the sonotrode).<br>
None of the aforesaid prior art documents (DE 19536881, US 6592711, JP 2004123150) are<br>
suitable for solving said objective technical problem, since, DE 19536881 and US 6592711 teach<br>
away from the solution of the problem (the weight of the sonotrode means tends to push them and<br>
shock against the roller. In US 6592711, even if it provides damping means for reducing vibrations,<br>
shocks can occur, since, the weight of the sonotrodes tend to push them towards the roller and JP<br>
2004123150 does not have a useful action of weight of the sonotrode means to prevent said shocks<br>
(the sonotrodes move horizontally).<br>
It would be also kindly appreciated that such considerations are not linked to a necessary<br>
heavy weight of the sonotrode, since, even a low-weight sonotrode can reach the same advantages. In<br>
fact, irrespective of the exact value of the sonotrode"s weight, the latter tends anyway to push the<br>
sonotrode away from the roller in the case that the sonotrode is mounted under the roller, and<br>
therefore, a very useful effect is achieved and any hammer-effect on the roller, due to vibrations of<br>
the sonotrode, is avoided.<br>
Both DE 19536881 and US 6592711 refer to the welding of thermoplastic material whilst the<br>
present invention, as discussed hereinafter, refers to the welding of a continuous web of filter paper.<br>
It is known that sheets or webs of thermoplastic material (for example, those for plastic<br>
folders as commonly used) have a thickness that is greater than the thickness of the filter paper<br>
commonly used for making filter bags of sachets. Consequently, different technical problems arise<br>
when processing the two types of material. Such different problems involve important implicit<br>
technical differences between corresponding unit for sealing, which involve, for example, differences<br>
in the distance between the sonotrode and the product or differences in the rigidity of the unit or,<br>
even more, differences in the length of the stroke movement of the sonotrode towards and away from<br>
the roller.<br>
In particular, the technical problem underlying the instant invention is that the rigidity of the<br>
supports and the high number of external control variables for maintaining the distance between the<br>
sonotrode and the product create vibrations resulting in distances that are larger than acceptable for a<br>
good quality seal and slowing down sealing operations themselves on account of control and<br>
feedback between the sonotrodes and the control system. Such a technical problem can be considered<br>
as avoiding disengagement between the filter paper which is very thin and the sonotrode.<br>
DE 19536881 does not face such a technical problem, since, it does not disclose means for<br>
reducing vibration of the sonotrode.<br>
US 6592711 faces the technical problem of making the sonotrode correctly follow, with<br>
constant pressure, the surface of the web to be welded. Furthermore, US 6592711, does not disclose<br>
the processing of a filter paper, which is thinner than a thermoplastic web.<br>
The present invention therefore has an object to overcome the above mentioned drawback<br>
through a unit that enables the sealer sonotrode to apply a substantially constant contact force on the<br>
product to be sealed, while at the same time allowing high operating speeds and reducing costs.<br>
Disclosure of the invention<br>
According to the invention, this object is achieved by a unit for sealing filter bags for products<br>
for infusion, the unit comprising at least : a shaped revolving roller with circumferential and radial<br>
tracks that act as guides to make longitudinal and transversal contact seals on a web of filter paper<br>
folded onto itself and moving under the roller, characterized by using : sealing sonotrode means<br>
arranged in sealing position under the roller and close to the moving web in such a way as to form a<br>
tubular web of filter paper with a succession of substantially flattened filter bags formed on it; said<br>
sealing sonotrode means being caused to be operated upon by fluid-driven means designed to control,<br>
through appropriate means, the variable constituted by the contact force and / or the distance between<br>
the sealing means and the roller.<br>
Description of the drawinqs<br>
The technical characteristics of the invention, with<br>
reference to the above aims, are clearly described in the claims<br>
below and its advantage are apparent from the detailed<br>
description which follows, with reference to the accompanying<br>
drawings which illustrate a preferred embodiment of the invention<br>
provided merely by way of example without restricting the scope of<br>
the inventive concept, and in which:<br>
- Figure 1 is a front view, with some parts cut away and<br>
others in cross section, of an ultrasound unit for sealing lengths<br>
of filter paper according to the invention;<br>
- Figure 2 is a side view, with some parts cut away and other<br>
parts in cross-section, of the unit of Figure 1;<br>
- Figure 3 is a schematic top plan view, with some parts cut<br>
away and other parts in cross-section, of the unit of Figure l.<br>
Detailed description of the preferred embodiments of the invention<br>
With reference to the accompanying drawings, in particular<br>
Figure 1, the unit according to the invention is used to seal<br>
filter bags for products for infusion.<br>
More specifically, the unit, which is denoted in its<br>
entirety by the numeral l, may be used to make longitudinal and<br>
transversal seals on a web of filter paper 5 (drawn with a dashed<br>
line) unwound from a roll of filter paper and folded onto itself<br>
at a suitable station (neither of these being illustrated in the<br>
accompanying drawings).<br>
The unit 1 essentially comprises:<br>
- a shaped revolving roller 2 with circumferential and radial<br>
tracks 3 and 4 that act as guides to make a longitudinal and<br>
transversal contact seal on a web 5 of filter paper folded onto<br>
itself and moving under the roller 2 (see arrow A), using<br>
- sealing sonotrode means 6 arranged in sealing position<br>
under the roller 2 and close to the moving web 5 in such a way as<br>
to form a tubular web of filter paper with, a succession of<br>
substantially flattened filter bags formed on it.<br>
Still with reference to Figure 1, the sealing sonotrode<br>
means 6 are operated upon by fluid-driven means 7 designed to<br>
control, through appropriate means 8, the variable constituted by<br>
the contact force and/or the distance between the sealing means 6<br>
and the roller 2.<br>
More specifically, the fluid-driven means 7 may consist of<br>
at least one pneumatic cylinder 7c linked at one end to a fixed<br>
lower frame 9 (forming part of the machine) and at the other end<br>
to the upper portion of the sealing sonotrode means 6.<br>
As illustrated in Figures 2 and 3/ the sealing sonotrode<br>
means 6 are two separate sonotrode units 6a and 6b mounted side by<br>
side in such a way as to perform two separate sealing operations,<br>
resulting in a longitudinal seal (made by the unit 6a) " and a<br>
transversal seal (made by the unit 6b), acting in conjunction with<br>
respective plates 6c, 6d that come into contact with the passing<br>
product and with the aforementioned tracks 3 and 4.<br>
The first sonotrode 6a is in constant contact with the web 5<br>
against a circumferential track 3 on the roller 2, whilst the<br>
second sonotrode 6b is spaced from the web 5 and makes a<br>
transversal each time one of the radial tracks 4 passes.<br>
The sonotrode units 6a and 6b are supported by a plate 10<br>
that is linked to a shaft 11 protruding from the fixed frame 9.<br>
The fluid-driven means 7 preferably comprise two cylinders 7c and<br>
7d linked at the top to the plate 10 in such a way that the first<br>
cylinder 7c permits adjustment of the contact force on the first<br>
sonotrode 6a that makes the longitudinal seal on the web 5, and<br>
the second cylinder 7d permits adjustment of the gap between the<br>
working end of the other sonotrode 6b and the respective<br>
transversal sealing track 4 facing the sonotrode 6b.<br>
The aforementioned means 8 for controlling the cylinders 7c<br>
and 7d may consist of a respective pressure switch 8a designed to<br>
vary the contact force and/or the distance of the sonotrode units<br>
6a, 6b.<br>
It will be understood that the invention can be modified and<br>
adapted in several ways without thereby departing from the scope<br>
of the inventive concept. Moreover, all the details of the<br>
invention may be substituted by technically equivalent elements.<br>
