LAUNDRY TREATMENT COMPOSITIONS<br>
HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Murnbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br>
WO 2005/118761<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/005121<br><br>
LAUNDRY TREATMENT COMPOSITIONS<br>
Technical Field<br>
5	The present invention relates to compositions comprising        modified polysaccharides and sugar polyesters. These compositions are suitable, for example, for use as laundry treatment compositions or as components thereof. Laundry treatment compositions containing compositions according to <br>
10  the invention, provide softening benefits to fabric.  The<br>
invention further relates to a method of depositing a sugar     polyester from solution or dispersion, onto a substrate by means of such a composition.<br>
15  Background of the Invention<br>
 Compositions which are capable of imparting softening to substrates such as fabric, hair and skin are well known in <br>
the art.  To date, silicones and related compounds are <br>
20  widely used as softening agents.<br>
However, despite its excellent softening properties, <br>
silicone has a number of inherent disadvantages associated with it, hence the need exists for new softening compounds <br>
25  that don't have the disadvantages of silicones.<br>
In the context of laundry products, the low biodegradable nature of silicone is a notable disadvantage and one which increases in significance as environmental legislation <br>
30	continues to get tougher.  Therefore, to find alternatives<br>
    to silicone which are more biodegradable is a widely sought<br><br>
WO 2005/118761<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/005121<br><br>
-  2   -<br>
after goal.  Another problem often encountered when using silicones as softeners in laundry is that although they <br>
increase the soft feel of a fabric they decrease the <br>
fabric's absorbency.  A decrease in the absorbency <br>
5	properties of a fabric means that its ability to take up water decreases - this is particularly problematic for towels and is strongly disliked by the consumer.  Further, cost reduction is an ever present goal across the industry and cheaper alternatives to silicones as softeners are thus <br>
10   sought after.<br>
The improvement of these aspects without a consequential loss in softening capability is clearly desirable.<br>
15  Prior Art<br>
WO-A-00/18861 provides a water-soluble or water-dispersible polysaccharide which comprises: a deposition enhancing part (the polymeric backbone - which in the case of cellulose<br>
20  shows self-recognition properties) and a benefit agent group, which may be a softening agent, attached to the. deposition enhancing part by a hydrolytically stable bond. During a treatment process the material undergoes a chemical change which does not involve the hydrolytically stable bond<br>
25  but by which the affinity of the material onto the substrate is increased.  A preferred material, is cellulose mono acetate (CMA).  This molecule has an affinity for cotton due to the self-recognition properties of cellulose and is soluble due to the presence of acetate groups.  The acetate<br>
30  groups hydrolyse in aqueous solution causing the deposited cellulose to remain on a cellulosic substrate.  Manufacture<br><br>

of CMA involves excessive esterification of the -OH groups of the cellulose and then hydrolysis of some of the esters to attain the desired degree of esterification.<br>
5  Our UK patent application no. GB 0121148 discloses a<br>
substituted b1-4 linked polysaccharide such as cellulose<br>
mono-acetate with one or more independently selected silicone chains covalently attached to it as the benefit agent.<br>
10<br>
While the molecules of GB 0121148 are relatively expensive, it has been found that the covalently-linked silicone chains may be used to emulsify droplets of a further portion of silicone to enhance the deposition of that material.<br>
15<br>
Our UK patent application no GB 0123380 discloses a laundry treatment composition comprising a composition similar to that of GB 0121148 in combination with a non-covalently bonded silicone which is, for example, emulsified in the<br>
20  same composition.  This enables relatively large quantities of silicone to be deposited without an excessive on-cost for the formulator.<br>
Our co-pending patent application, GB 0313900, discloses a 25  non-hydrolysable polysaccharide, with a textile benefit<br>
    species bonded thereto by a hydrolytically stable bond.  A             further benefit species may also be present.  Silicone is <br>
both preferred and exemplified as both benefit species. Despite the above-mentioned advances, the need remains to <br>
30  further improve upon such deposition systems.  It is<br>
advantageous to reduce cost, improve the biodegradability of<br><br>

   It has now surprisingly been found that compositions <br>

   Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
 As set out above, the composition of the present invention <br>
 comprises a polysaccharide which is water-soluble or water<br>
5   dispersible in nature and which has a' hydrophobic agent,<br>
 "which is attached to the polysaccharide by a hydrolytically <br>
  stable, bond,/and which in a preferred embodiment is a<br>
     silicone.  The composition further comprises a sugar<br>
     polyester (SPE).  The SPE may or may not be chemically <br>
10	bonded to the polysaccharide.  Furthermore, some of the SPE<br>
   may be- chemically bonded to the polysaccharide,, whilst some <br>
   is not.<br>
      The invention will be described below, in respect of various <br>
15    embodiments.'<br>
For the sake of" clarity, the term- "modified polysaccharide" as used herein means the polysaccharide...having the hydrophobic, agent bonded thereto.<br>
2 0<br><br>
2 5<br><br>
The polysaccharide<br>
The water-soluble or dispersable polysaccharide is a b-i,4-1 inked polysaccharide having an affinity for cellulose.<br>
The polysaccharide may be hydrolysable or non-hydrolysable<br><br>
By hydrolysable polysaccharide is meant' that the      polysaccharide- contains a deposition enhancing" group which <br>
30  undergoes a chemical change under conditions (including<br>

WO 2005/118761<br><br>

temperature) of use to increase the affinity of the                  polysaccharide for a substrate.  In those embodiments of the invention intended for aqueous treatment of substrates, such as in a wash liquor, these conditions can include elevated Ph<br>
5	and/or temperatures above ambient.  By non-hydrolysable   polysaccharide is meant that the polysaccharide does not<br>
    contain such a deposition enhancing group.<br>
By an increase in the affinity of the polysaccharide for a <br>
10	substrate (such as a textile fabric) upon a chemical change, <br>
is meant that at some time during the treatment process, the    amount of material that has been deposited is greater when <br>
the chemical change is occurring or has occurred, compared to    when the chemical change has not occurred and is not <br>
15	occurring, or is occurring more slowly, the comparison being   made with all conditions being equal except for that change <br>
in the conditions which is necessary to affect the rate of    chemical change.<br>
  20   By water-soluble, as used herein, is meant is that the<br>
material forms an isotropic solution on addition to water or    another aqueous solution.<br>
By water-dispersible, as used herein, is meant is that the<br>
25   material forms a finely divided suspension on addition to   water or another aqueous solution.<br>
Deposition onto a substrate includes deposition by adsorption, co-crystallisation, entrapment and/or adhesion. <br>

The polysaccharide may be straight or branched.  Many <br>
naturally occurring polysaccharides have at least some <br>
degree of branching, or at any rate at least some saccharide rings are in the form of pendant side groups on a main<br>
 5    polysaccharide backbone.<br>
A polysaccharide comprises a plurality of saccharide rings which have pendant hydroxyl groups.  In the preferred polysaccharides of the present invention, at least some of<br>
10     these hydroxyl groups are independently substituted by, or replaced with, one or more other substituents, at least one being a hydrophobic agent.  In our preferred class of materials the hydrophobic agent is a silicone chain.  The "average degree of substitution" for a given class of<br>
15     substituent means the average number of substituents of that     class per saccharide ring for the totality of polysaccharide molecules in the sample and is determined for all saccharide rings.<br>
20     Deposition enhancing groups<br>
By deposition enhancing group is meant a group which      undergoes a chemical change under conditions of use to <br>
increase the affinity of the polysaccharide for a substrate. 25     The deposition enhancing group is attached to the<br>
   polysaccharide agent group by means of a chemical bond.<br>
The average degree of substitution of these pendant groups    which undergo the chemical change is preferably from 0.1 to<br>
30     3 (e.g. from 0.3 to 3), more preferably from 0.1 to 1 (e.g.         from 0.3 to 1).<br><br>
WO 2005/118761	PCT/EP2005/005121<br>
-   9   -<br>
The chemical change which causes the increased substrate   affinity is preferably caused by hydrolysis, perhydrolysis<br>
  or bond-cleavage, optionally catalysed by an enzyme or <br>
  another catalyst.  Hydrolysis of substituent ester-linked <br>
5   groups is typical.<br>
By ester linkage is meant that the hydrogen of an -OH group,     present on the polysaccharide backbone, has been replaced by<br>
   a substituent such as R'-CO-, R'SO2- etc to form a<br>
10	carboxylic acid ester, sulphonic acid ester (as appropriate)<br>
   etc together with the remnant oxygen attached to the <br>
   saccharide ring.  In some cases, the group R' may for <br>
   example contain a heteroatom, e.g. as an -NH- group attached <br>
   to the carbonyl, sulphonyl etc group, so that the linkage as<br>
15 a whole could be regarded as a urethane etc linkage.<br>
However, the term ester linkage is still to be construed as      encompassing these structures.  Thus, the deposition <br>
  enhancing groups have the general formula (I) :-<br>
20	-OR<br>
where the oxygen is the remnant oxygen from the -OH group attached to the saccharide ring, and<br>
25  where the R groups are independently selected from groups of formulae: -<br><br>

PCT/EP2005/005121<br><br><br><br><br>

wherein each R is independently selected from C1-20<br>
(preferably C1-6) alkyl, C2-20 (preferably C2-6) alkenyl (e.g. vinyl) and C5-7 aryl (e.g. phenyl) any of which is optionally substituted by one or more substituents independently <br>
10  selected from C1-4 alkyl, C1-12 (preferably C1-4) alkoxy,   hydroxyl, vinyl and phenyl groups;<br>
each R2 is independently selected from hydrogen and groups R1 as hereinbefore defined;<br>
15<br>
R3 is a bond or is selected from C1-4 alkylene, C2-4 alkenylene and C5_7 arylene (e.g. phenylene) groups, the carbon atoms in any of these being optionally substituted by one or more substituents independently selected from C3.-12 (preferably Ci_<br>
20  4) alkoxy, vinyl, hydroxyl, halo and amine groups;<br><br>
WO 2005/118761<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/005121<br><br>
-   11   -<br>
each R4 is independently selected from hydrogen, counter<br><br>
cations such as alkali metal (preferably Na) or  CCa or    Mg,<br>
and groups R1 as hereinbefore defined;  and<br>
5	groups R which together with the oxygen atom forming the linkage to the respective saccharide ring forms an ester or <br>
    hemi-ester group of a tricarboxylic- or higher <br>
    polycarboxylic- or other complex acid such as citric acid, <br>
    an amino acid, a synthetic amino acid analogue or a protein; 10<br>
any remaining R groups being selected from hydrogen and other substituents.<br>
Some of the R groups may optionally have one or more <br>
15   structures, for example as hereinbefore described.  For<br>
example, one or more R groups may simply be hydrogen or an alkyl group.<br>
Preferred groups which undergo the chemical change may for <br>
20	  example be independently selected from one or more of <br>
   acetate, propanoate, trifluroacetate, 2-(2-hydroxy-l-        oxopropoxy) propanoate, lactate, glycolate, pyruvate, <br>
crotonate, isovalerate cinnamate, formate, salicylate, carbamate, methylcarbamate, benzoate, gluconate, <br>
25	methanesulphonate, toluene, sulphonate, groups and hemiester groups of fumaric, malonic, itaconic, oxalic, maleic, <br>
  succinic, tartaric, aspartic, glutamic, and malic acids.<br>
Particularly preferred such groups are the monoacetate,<br>
30   hemisuccinate, and 2-(2-hydroxy-l-oxopropoxy)propanoate.       The term "monoacetate" is used herein to denote those<br><br>
WO 2005/118761<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/005121<br><br>
-   12   -<br>
acetates with the degree of substitution of less than 1 and greater than 0.4 on a cellulose or other b-1,4 polysaccharide backbone.<br>
5	   Cellulose esters of hydroxyacids can be obtained using the   acid anhydride in acetic acid solution at 20-30°C and in any case below 50°C.  When the product has dissolved the liquid is poured into water (b.p. 316,160).  Tri-esters can be converted to secondary products as with the triacetate.<br>
10  Glycollic and lactic ester are most common.<br>
Cellulose glycollate may also be obtained from cellulose<br>
chloracetate (GB-A-320 842) by treating 100 parts with 32<br>
parts of NaOH in alcohol added in small portions.<br>
15<br>
An alternative method of preparing cellulose esters consists<br>
in the partial displacement of the acid radical in a<br>
cellulose ester by treatment with another acid of higher<br>
ionisation constant (FR-A-702 116).  The ester is heated at<br>
20  about 100°C with the acid which, preferably, should be a   solvent for the ester.  By this means cellulose acetate-oxalate, tartrate, maleate, pyruvate, salicylate and phenylglycollate have been obtained, and from cellulose tribenzoate a cellulose benzoate-pyruvate.  A cellulose<br>
25  acetate-lactate or acetate-glycollate could be made in this way also.  As an example cellulose acetate (10 g.) in dioxan (75 ml.) containing oxalic acid (10 g.) is heated at 100°C for 2 hours under reflux.<br>
30  Multiple esters are prepared by variations of this process. A simple ester of cellulose, e.g. the acetate, is dissolved<br><br>
WO 2005/118761<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/005121<br><br>
-   13   -<br>
in a mixture of two (or three) organic acids, each of which<br>
 has an ionisation constant greater than that of acetic acid (1.82 x 10"5) .  With solid acids suitable solvents such as propionic acid, dioxan and ethylene dichloride are used.  If <br>
5    a mixed cellulose ester is treated with an acid this should have an ionisation constant greater than that of either of the acids already in combination.<br>
     A cellulose acetate-lactate-pyruvate is prepared from <br>
10   cellulose acetate, 40 per cent, acetyl (100 g.) ,   in a bath <br>
of 125 ml. pyruvic acid and 125 ml. of 85 per cent, lactic         acid by heating at 100°C for 18 hours.  The product is <br>
soluble in water and is precipitated and washed with ether-       acetone. M.p. 230-250°C. <br>
15<br>
Other Substituents<br>
As well as the hydrophobic agent and optional deposition enhancing groups, pendant groups of other types may<br>
20  optionally be present, i.e. groups which do not confer a<br>
softening benefit and which do not undergo a chemical change to enhance substrate affinity.  Within that class of other groups is the sub-class of groups for enhancing the solubility of the material (e.g. groups which are, or<br>
25  contain one or more free carboxylic acid/salt and/or sulphonic acid/salt and/or sulphate groups).<br>
Examples of solubility enhancing substituents include carboxyl, sulphonyl, hydroxyl, (poly)ethyleneoxy- and/or <br>
30  (poly) propyleneoxy-containing groups, as well as amine   groups.<br><br>

The other pendant groups preferably comprise/from 0% to 65%, <br>
more preferably from 0% to 10% of the total number of <br>
pendant groups. The water-solubilising groups could<br>
comprise' from 0% to 100% of those other groups but <br>
5	  preferably from 0% to 20%, more preferably from 0% to 10%, <br>
still more preferably from 0% to 5% of, the total number of <br>
other pendant groups.<br>
A preferred group of polysaccharides (locust bean gum, for <br>
10	example) have pendant galactose or other sugar residues which make them" effectively more water dispersible/soluble than<br>

By chemically bonded is meant the SPE is attached by a chemical bond (such as a covalent bond or an ionic bond) to the polysaccharide.<br>
5    That sugar polyester which is not chemically bonded to the polysaccharide may be bonded thereto by a physical bond (such as hydrogen bonds, van der waal forces, hydrophobic interactions, electrostatic interactions, etc).<br>
10  In the embodiment of the invention where some SPE is bonded to the polysaccharide by a chemical bond and some is not, the ratio of sugar polyester which is bonded to the polysaccharide by a chemical bond to that sugar polyester which is not bonded by a chemical bond is in the range of<br>
15  from 1:1000 to 1:1 and preferably from 1:200 to 1:4.<br>
The sugar polyester is preferably selected from the group   consisting of sucrose polyesters, glucose polyesters and cellobiose polyesters, and is most preferably a sucrose <br>
20  polyester.<br>
Preferably, the ratio of the polysaccharide with the      hydrophobic agent bonded thereto to the SPE is in the range of from' 1:200 to 1:5 and most preferably from around 1:20 to <br>

The Hydrophobic Agent<br>
The hydrophobic agent is one that renders the material more surface active than the polysaccharide alone.  By surface <br>
5   active is meant that the material tends to accumulate at oil/water interfaces and lower their surface tension.<br>
The hydrophobicity should not be so great as to prevent the dissolution or dispersion of the polysaccharide in water. <br>
10<br>
The hydrophobic agent is preferably selected from the group consisting of silicone, hydrocarbon and hydrophobic polymer. In one embodiment the hydrophobic agent is a silicone.<br>
15   The hydrophobic agent is attached to the polysaccharide by a stable bond.  That means that the bonding of the hydrophobic agent should be sufficiently stable so as not to undergo hydrolysis during processing or on storage prior to use or in the environment of the treatment process for the duration<br>
20   of that process.  For example, in laundry cleaning<br>
applications, the bond between the hydrophobic agent and polysaccharide should be sufficiently stable so that it does not undergo hydrolysis in the wash liquor, at the wash temperature, before the SPE has been deposited onto the<br>
25  fabric.<br>
Preferably, the bond between the hydrophobic agent and the<br>
polysaccharide is such that the decay rate constant (kd) of<br>
the material in an aqueous solution at 0.01 wt% of the <br>
30   material together with 0.1 wt% of anionic surfactant at a temperature of 4 0°C at a pH of 10.5 is such that<br><br>

Suitable non-ionic surfactants include the (poly)-alkoxylated analogues of saturated or unsaturated fatty alcohols, for example, having from 8 to 22, preferably from 9 to 18, more preferably from 10 to 15 carbon atoms on<br>
15  average in the hydrocarbon chain thereof and preferably on average from 3 to 11, more preferably from 4 to 9 alkyleneoxy groups.  Most preferably, the alkyleneoxy groups are independently selected from ethyleneoxy, propyleneoxy and butylenoxy, especially ethyleneoxy and propylenoxy, or<br>

It  should be noted    that the modified polysaccharide is<br>
frequently not a pure material due to incomplete conversion    and the ratio of the material as made to the emulsifying agent is typically around 3:1.<br>
15  Further, in any such composition (especially emulsion<br>
components) the weight ratio of SPE to emulsifying agent is from 100:1 to 2:1, preferably from 60:1 to 5:1, more preferably around 33:1 (where the modified polysaccharide is not the sole emulsifying agent).<br>

An especially preferred bleach system comprises a peroxy bleach compound (preferably sodium percarbonate optionally together with a bleach activator), and a transition metal bleach catalyst as described and claimed in EP 458 397A, EP                               5  458 398A and EP 509 787A (Unilever).<br>
Bleach systems may comprise transition metal catalyst systems such as those disclosed in WO9965905; WO0012667; WO0012808; WO0029537, and, WO0060045.  These catalyst systems have the              10  advantage that they require no added peroxyl compounds and can work, directly or indirectly, using atmospheric oxygen.<br>
The compositions according to the invention may also contain one or more enzyme(s).  Suitable enzymes include the                          15  proteases, amylases, cellulases, oxidases, peroxidases and lipases usable for incorporation in detergent compositions.<br>

Proteolytic enzymes or proteases of various qualities and            25  origins and having activity in various pH ranges of from 4-12<br>
are available and can be used in the instant invention.<br>
Examples of suitable proteolytic enzymes are the subtilisins<br>
which are obtained from particular strains of B. Subtilis B.<br>
licheniformis, such as the commercially available subtilisins 30  Maxatase (Trade Mark), as supplied by Genencor International<br><br>

The combination of non-cellulose polysaccharides and 20  cellulase enzymes is particularly useful, as these enzymes exhibit reduced activity against this class of polysaccharides, as compared to their activity against cellulose.  Cellulase is known to be useful and is used in laundry products for de-fuzzing and colour brightening.<br>
 25<br>
The compositions of the invention may contain alkali metal (preferably sodium) carbonate, in order to increase detergency and ease processing.  Sodium carbonate may suitably be present in amounts ranging from 1 to 60 wt%,                                30  preferably from 2 to 40 wt%.  However, compositions<br><br>

The detergent composition when diluted in the wash liquor (during a typical wash cycle) will typically give a pH of the wash liquor from 7 to 10.5 for a main wash detergent.<br>
25  Particulate detergent compositions are suitably prepared by spray-drying a slurry of compatible heat-insensitive ingredients, and then spraying on or post-dosing those ingredients unsuitable for processing via the slurry.  The skilled detergent formulator will have no difficulty in<br>
30  deciding which ingredients should be included in the slurry and which should not.<br><br>

Processes using high-speed mixer/granulators are disclosed, for example, in EP 340 013A, EP 367 339A, EP 390 251A and EP 420 317A (Unilever).<br>
15  Liquid detergent compositions can be prepared by admixing the essential and optional ingredients thereof in any desired order to provide compositions containing components in the requisite concentrations.  Liquid compositions according to the present invention can also be in compact<br>
20  form which means it will contain a lower level of water compared to a conventional liquid detergent.<br>
Product Forms<br>
25  Product forms include powders, liquids, gels, tablets, any of which are optionally incorporated in a water-soluble or water dispersible sachet.  The means for manufacturing any of the product forms are well known in the art.  If the composition comprising the modified polysaccharide and SPE<br>
30  is to be incorporated in a powder (optionally the powder to be tableted), and whether or not pre-emulsified, it is<br><br>

In the following examples where percentages are mentioned, this is to be understood as percentage by weight.  In the following tables where the values do not add up to 100 these are to be understood as parts by weight. 5<br>
Example 1 - Synthesis of cellulose monoacetate (CMA) with grafted silicone<br>
Monocarboxydecyl terminated polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)<br>
10  source (Molecular weight 5,000: 1.5 g, 0.23 mmols) was<br>
dispersed in dimethylacetamide (10 cm3) by vigorous stirring under nitrogen.  Carbonyldiimidazole (37 mg, 0.23 mmols) was then added and the dispersion heated with stirring to 70°C under nitrogen for two hours.  A solution of cellulose<br>
15  monoacetate (DS 0.58; 1 g, 5.3 mmol equivalents based on primary hydroxyl groups) in dimethylacetamide (10 cm3) was then added and stirring and heating was continued for a further 20 hours.  Following this time the mixture was filtered and the filtrate added to vigorously stirred<br>
20  acetone to give a white precipitate.  This precipitate was filtered off, washed with acetone and dried under vacuum to give a white polymer (1.01 g) .  From the aH NMR of the polymer (after hydrolysis with 20% DC1 in D20 for two hours at 80°C) and normalising the integration of the anomeric<br>
25  protons to unity and the acetate group to 0.58 the<br>
integration of the Si-CH3 group (at 0.0 ppm) gives an overall degree of substitution (DS) of siloxane groups of 0.0015. This material is hereinafter referred to as "Polymer A".<br>

Example 2 - Preparation of Locust Bean Gum with Grafted Silicone<br>
Lithium chloride (27 g) was dissolved in anhydrous dimethyl 5  sulfoxide (300 cm3) with heating (150°C) and stirring under nitrogen.  Once the lithium chloride was dissolved the solution was cooled to 120 °C before slowly adding locust bean gum (3.5 g) over a period of 20 minutes with vigorous stirring.<br>
10<br>
The viscous solution thus obtained was then further cooled to 70 °C and carbonyl diimidazole (54 mg, 0.5 mmols) was added and stirring and heating was continued for a further two hours.  Diaminopropyl terminated polydimethylsiloxane<br>
15  (3,000 mwt, 1 g, 0.33 mmols) was then added and the solution stirred with heating for 18 hours.<br>
The solution was cooled to room temperature before adding drop-wise to vigorously stirred acetone (3 litres) to 20  precipitate the polymer.  The suspension was centrifuged to isolate the product which was then washed with acetone (2 x 200 cm3) before drying under vacuum (40°C) overnight to give an off-white solid (3.1 g).<br>
25  From the 2H NMR of the hydrolysed product (heated to 1 hour at 70°C in 20% DC1/D20) the degree of substitution of PDMS groups to sugar units was found to be 5.3 x 10~4.  This material is hereinafter referred to as "Polymer B".<br><br>

This rinse step was repeated one more time after which, the rinse liquor was decanted from the pots, the cloths gently squeezed by hand to remove excess water and the fabrics dried flat                       5  overnight under ambient conditions.  Each condition was run in duplicate.<br>
The quantity of SPE deposited onto the fabrics during the wash was then determined as follows.  Each fabric piece was                  10  cut into three and the individual pieces weighed.  Each<br>
fabric piece was added to a bottle containing 50 cm of<br>
tetrahydrofuran (THF) and the deposited SPE extracted with the aid of ultrasonication for five minutes.  The amount of SPE extracted was determined by gel permeation chromatography<br>
15  (GPC) using a PLgel 3um 100A column with THF eluent and an evaporative light scattering detector ELS 1000 light scattering detector.  The area under the elution peak for the SPE was calculated by integration of the trace and this area was used to calculate the concentration of SPE in the THF<br>
20  solution from the extraction by comparison to a calibration curve produced using SPE in THF standards.  The results from the three portions of cloth were used to calculate an average value for the amount of SPE deposited on the fabric expressed as milligrams of SPE deposited per gram of fabric.
