FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to new optically pure l-N-alkylamino-l-phenyl-2-(l-pyrrolidinyl)propane hydrochlorides (formula-1) and process for their preparation via formation of novel intermediate 1 -chloro-1 -phenyl-2-(l -pyrrolidinyl)propane hydrochloride (formula-2) by chlorination of l-phenyl-2-(l-pyrrolidinyl)propane-l-ol hydrochloride (formula-3) with thionyl chloride followed by reaction with excess of alkyl amine .<br><br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Amination reactions constitute an important class of regiospecific substitution reactions in view of their impact on the mechanistic and synthetic organic chemistry as well as their commercial applications. Optically pure l-N-alkylamino-l-phenyl-2-(l-pyrrolidinyl)propanes belong to the family of 1,2-diamines. The products of a-amination such as diamines and triamines and their derivatives are known to have vital applications such as chelating agents in radiopharmaceuticals [J. Org. Chem., Vol. 54, pp.1940-1943 (1989)], precursors of aza-macrocycles (Lehn , Ace. Chem. Res., Vol. 11, pp. 49-57,1978) and in medicinal chemistry (Kasina, J. Med. Chem., Vol. 29, pp. 1933-1940, 1986). They also play a vital role as chiral auxiliaries in a variety of asymmetric transformations involving chiral phosphonamides, [J. Am. Chem, Soc, Vol. 106, pp. 5754-5756. (1984)] Lewis acids, metal enolates [(Corey J. Am. Chem. Soc, Vol. Ill, pp. 5493-5495. 1989)], dienophiles (Tetrahedron Lett., Vol. 28, pp. 2681.1987) and transition metal reagents (Bull. Chem. Soc.Jpn., pp. 2012-2015. 1980).<br>
N-Alkylated derivatives of (1 R,2 S)-(-)-ephedrine, (1 R,2R)-(")-pseudo-ephedrine and (IR, 2S)-(-) norephedrine are excellent substrates for regiospecific a-amination reactions via the intermediacy of reactive a-halo or a-ester derivatives such<br><br>
as mesylates, tosylates etc. These substitution reactions could be with sodium azide, amines, imides, thiols, thiolactic acid, n-hydroxyphthalimide and diphenylphosphine to give, in each case, a single isomer.<br>
The methods for preparing the vicinal diamines are rather limited, particularly when other sensitive functionalities are present elsewhere in the molecule. Olefins react with azide anion oxidatively to form vicinal diazides (Fristad , J. Org. Chem., Vol. 50, pp. 3647-3649 (1985), Moriarty 1986, Becker 1980). The reduction of these diazides to diamines is prone to alternative reactions and requires careful selection of reductants. Another drawback of the use of azides is their possible explosiveness.<br>
J.Org.Chem.,Vol. 54, pp.1940-1943 (1989) describes the use of the readily available and inexpensive l,3-diamino-2-propanols as starting materials for the synthesis of diamines.<br>
J.Org.Chem., Vol. 57, pp. 1663-1671 (1992) highlights methods of synthesis for amines and triamines for use as ligands in organocopper conjugate addition reactions with ephedrine and pseudoephedrine as starting aminoalcohols. The |3-hydroxy tertiary amines were prepared by alkylation of (IR, 2S)-(-)-ephedrine, (lR,2R)-(-)-pseudo-ephedrine with a-chloro-N, N-dimethylacetamide. These P-hydroxy tertiary amines were mesylated in-situ with methanesulphonyl chloride in THF in presence of triethylamine and then treated with various amines and the corresponding diamines were isolated. Treatment of the mesylate in-situ with sodium azide gave the corresponding azide, which on reduction with lithium aluminium hydride gave the triamine .<br>
Organic Syntheses, Coll.Vol.lO, p.556 , Vol. 77, p. 12.(2000)describes the method for preparing diamine by N,N-bis alkylation of norephedrine with 1,4-dibromobutane and subsequent double inversion of the benzylic stereogenic centre in N-pyrrolinylnorephedrine. Thus, treatment of (1 R,2S)-norephedrine with 1,4-dibromobutane, tetra-butylammonium iodide and sodium carbonate in refiuxing THF for 48 h followed by mesylation and reaction with methylamine gave the expected diamine (lR,2S)-l-N-methyl-l-phenyl-2-N-pyrrolidinylpropanamine in 83% overall yield as the<br><br>
only diastereoisomer as confirmed by1H NMR. The other diastereoisomer was prepared by a similar approach in 84% yield from (IS, 2R)-norephedrine.<br>
J.Org.chem., Vol .26, pp.3507-3509 reports synthetic procedure for (IS, 2S)-norpseudoephedrine hydrochloride involving Mitsunobu cyclisation and conversion to the required (IS, 2S)-1-N-methyl-l-phenyl-2-N-pyrrolidinylpropanamine. The structure of the propanamine was confirmed by H and   C NMR.<br>
Tetrahedron; Asymmetry, Vol. 10, pp. 4175-4182 (1999) describes the use of (IR, 2S)-l-N-methyl-l-phenyl-2-N-pyrrolidinylpropanamine as chiral base.<br>
Tetrahedron: Asymmetry, Vol. 14, pp. 1995-2004, (2003) reports synthesis of (R*,R*)-benzyl-(1, 2'-diphenyl-2-pyrrolidin-l-yl-ethyl)amine in a four step synthetic sequence starting from 1,2-diphenylethene with a low but significant enantioselectivity<br>
(15%) and yield of 82%.<br>
Another report by Peters and co-workers (Org. Lett., Vol. 7, pp. 4137-4140, 2005) highlights a four-step synthetic sequence starting from (-)-ephedrine and (+)-pseudo-ephedrine by converting the amino alcohols to the corresponding sulfamidates followed by hydrazinolysis giving rise to the chiral diamines<br>
Amedj Kouth and co-workers (Chem. Eur. J., Vol. 7, pp. 4368-4377, 2001) have reported improved stereoselectivity by using chiral lithium amide of (lR,2S)-l-N-methyl-l-phenyl-2-pyrrolidinylpropanamine in place of lithium diisopropylamide as a bulk base in catalytic deprotonatiom Synthesis of S-cyclohex-2-en-l-ol in 93% enantiomeric excess from cyclohexene oxide in 96% chemical yield has also been reported by these authors.<br>
Chem. Commun., pp.1521-1522. (2000) describes the role of 1-N-methyl-l-phenyl-2-pyrrolidinylpropanamine as a chiral catalyst. Reaction of epoxide with the lithium amide derived from racemic l-N-methyl-l-phenyl-2-pyrrolidinylpropanamine in cyclopentane resulted in diastereomeric product in 89%yield.<br>
Keeping in view the importance of chiral di and triamines in development of new drugs and also in various other fields as mentioned above, it is aimed to develop a<br><br>
simple one pot synthesis for 1 -N-alkylamino-1 -phenyl-2-( 1 -pyrrolidinyl)propane hydrochlorides via formation of intermediate 1 -chloro-1 -phenyl-2-( 1 -pyrrolidinyl) propane hydrochloride from l-phenyl-2-(l-pyrrolidinyl)propan-l-ol hydrochloride.<br>

Another objective of the present invention is to provide processes for the preparation of the above-mentioned new compounds which involves the initial alpha-chlorination of 1-phenyl-2-(l-pyrrolidinyl)propane-l-ol hydrochloride to obtain the chloro derivative at carbon-1, namely, 1 -chloro-1 -phenyl-2-( 1 -pyrrolidinyl)propane hydrochloride. The chloro compound is then subjected to nucleophilic substitution reactions at carbon -1 with excess of alkyl amines to yield chiral 1 -N-alkylamino-1 -phenyl-2-( 1 -pyrrolidinyl) propane hydrochlorides. This process involves two Walden inversions leading to the retention of configuration with the same stereochemistry in the final product as in the starting molecule.<br><br>

Then the methylamine 40ml (37%, 1.16mol) was added slowly to the reaction mixture followed by maintenance at 15-201'C for 6 h. After the completion of the reaction as indicated by HPLC, the reaction mixture was concentrated under vacuum.<br>

After the completion of the reaction as indicated by HPLC, the reaction mixture was concentrated under vacuum.<br>
The residue obtained was taken up in ethyl acetate as solution, cooled to 0-5 °C and oxalic acid was added till pH became 3.0-4.0. Reaction mass was allowed to stand for half an hour and the precipitate obtained was filtered and recrystallised from acetone. The solid was dried at 40-45 °C under vacuum.<br><br>

(IS, 2S)-l-Chloro-l-phenyl-2-(l-pyrrolidinyl)propane hydrochloride(10g ,0.039 mol) was added to 50mL of ethanol taken in a three-necked 500mL round-bottom flask and stirred well at 15-20 °C. Then the required cyclohexylamine (13.5g, 0.136mol) was added slowly to the reaction mixture followed by maintenance at 15-20 °C for 6 h. After the completion of the reaction as indicated by HPLC, the reaction mixture was concentrated under vacuum.<br>
The residue obtained was taken up in ethyl acetate as solution, cooled to 0-5 °C and dry HCl gas was bubbled through it.
