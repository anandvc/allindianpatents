				<td>PHOTO-ACTIVATED PRO-FRAGRANCES<br>
The present invention relates to a method for delivering an accord to a situs. Particularly, the present invention relates to photo-labile pro-accord conjugates, which are capable of<br>
releasing a fragrance raw material accord in a sequence of chemical reaction steps beginning with<br>
a photo-activated release of an oxygen-containing pro-fragrance compound. The conjugates are<br>
useful in formulating fragrance delivery systems. The conjugates of the present invention are<br>
capable of delivering any type of fragrance raw material.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Pro-fragrances and pro-accords have been used to enhance the delivery of fragrance raw materials and to sustain their duration. Typically pro-fragrances and pro-accords deliver alcohol, ketone, aldehyde, and ester fragrance raw materials via substrates which are hydrolyzed by one or more mechanisms, inter alia, the acidic pH of skin, nascent moisture.<br>
Fragrances or odors not only provide a pleasant aesthetic benefit, but also serve as a signal. For example, foods, which have soured or are no longer edible, may develop smells, which are repulsive and send a signal that they are no longer palatable. Therefore, the delivery of an aroma sensory signal is also a benefit, which a pro-fragrance can provide.<br>
However, pro-fragrances and pro-accords typically rely on the break down of a chemical species not based on accidental circumstance but on deliberate execution. There are currently no fragrance or odor releasing compounds which involve release of fragrances by way of a controlled chemical cascade initiated by exposure to electromagnetic radiation, inter alia, UV light. The present invention provides a means for delivering a fragrance or an accord wherein the delivery of said fragrance or said accord is instigated by exposure to light.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention meets the aforementioned need in that it has been surprisingly discovered that a fragrance accord can be delivered by photo-activated pro-accord conjugates. The photo-labile conjugates of the present invention are activated by the exposure of the conjugates to electromagnetic radiation, which is the first step in a chemical cascade resulting in the ultimate release of a fragrance raw material. The first step m the cascade involves photochemical fragmentation of a chemical bond between an oxygen atom contained within a fragrance precursor portion and a photochemically activated triggering unit.<br><br>
The conjugates of the present invention can be deposited onto fabric which is then stored, inter alia, kept in a drawer, closet, and when worn or used at a later time, is exposed to electromagnetic radiation which begins the cascade releasing the pro-accord.<br>
The first aspect of the present invention relates to a photo-activated pro-accord conjugate having the formula:<br><br>

A)	delivering to a situs a photo-activated pro-accord conjugate according to the<br>
present invention;<br>
said pro-accord capable of releasing one or more fragrance raw materials; and<br>
B)	exposing said pro-accord to electromagnetic radiation capable of initiating release<br>
of said fragrance raw materials.<br>
These and other objects, features, and advantages will become apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art from a reading of the following detailed description and the appended claims. All percentages, ratios and proportions herein are by weight, unless otherwise specified.<br>
All temperatures are in degrees Celsius (Â° C) unless otherwise specified. All documents cited are in relevant part, incorporated herein by reference.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to the surprising discovery that a perfume raw material accord can be delivered by a photo-activated pro-accord conjugate. The compounds of the present invention are stable to aqueous conditions until photo-fragmentation. Previous pro-accords were compounds, which were capable of delivering fragrance raw material accords via a one step break down of a pro-accord molecule. Said molecules were susceptible to pre-mature breakdown if the release was kinetically rapid, or thermodynamically favored in the presence of nascent moisture. The compounds of the present invention are conjugates, which comprise an aldehyde or ketone in a releasable form; as an acetal, thioacetal, or an aminal. Li one embodiment, the acetal formed comprises a fragrance raw material alcohol. In addition, the photo-labile moiety, the adduct which initiates breakdown of the conjugate when exposed to electromagnetic radiation, may be a perfume raw material component itself, for example, coumarin is widely used in perfumes.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention the term "phqto-labile unit" is defined herein as "a unit, which upon exposure to electromagnetic radiation acts to begin the cascade of chemical transitions which ultimately release the fragrance raw material or fragrance accord." In some embodiments of the present invention, for example, aminal forms of the conjugates wherein an amine is released, it may be advantageous that the released amine compound does not interfere with the aesthetic quality or character of the released fragrance raw material or accord. In the<br><br>
presence of light, the photo-labile unit serves to trigger the chemical reaction or reaction cascade that ends with the ultimate release of one or more fragrance raw materials.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention the term "Pro-fragrance unit" is defined herein as "That portion of the photo-labile pro-fragrance conjugate, which gives rise to the fragrance compound or pro-fragrance compound as a result of exposure of the photo-labile pro-fragrance conjugate to electromagnetic radiation or light."<br>
For the purpose of the present invention the term "pro-accord conjugate" is defined herein as "a chemical species, which by undergoing one or more chemical transformations results in the release of one or more fragrance compounds." Fragrance compounds and fragrance raw materials are terms, which refer to the final "perfume" ingredients, which are delivered and are used interchangeably herein. What is meant herein by the term "chemical transformation" includes conversion to a species of different molecular formula by any means, inter alia, hydrolysis, photolysis, thermolysis, autoxidation, addition, elimination and substitution reactions, as well as conversion to a species with the same molecular formula, but having an altered chemical orientation, i.e., isomerized.<br>
The chemical cascade, which begins the release of a fragrance raw material, may be controlled by requiring a certain wavelength of electromagnetic radiation to be present to initiate the release sequence. For example, "outside light", which typically comprises the full range of UV light, may be required to initiate the release of the fragrance precursor.<br>
Mixtures of fragrance materials are known by those skilled in the art of fragrances and perfumes as "accords". The term "accord" as used herein is defined as "a mixture of two or more 'fragrance raw materials', which are artfully combined to impart a pleasurable scent, odor, essence, or fragrance characteristic". For the purposes of the present invention, some conjugates which comprise one or more embodiments of the present invention may release only one fragrance raw material, however, these materials are also referred to as photo-activate pro-accords. For the purposes of the present invention "fragrance raw materials" are herein defined as compounds having a molecular weight of at least 100 g/mol and which are useful in imparting an odor, fragrance, essence, or scent either alone or in combination with other "fragrance raw materials".<br>
One important aspect of the present invention, which leads to many embodiments, relates to the admixing of conjugates that are comprised of aesthetically related fragrance raw materials. These aspects and embodiments will be detailed further herein below. Photo-Activated Pro-Accords<br>

The chains may be acyclic; alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, and the like, or cyclic, for example, cyclohexyl, or bicyclo[2.2.1]heptanyl. The term hydrocarbyl also encompasses any type of chain branching of the units such that the total number of carbon atoms in said chain is from 1 to 20. Hydrocarbyl units may be aromatic or non-aromatic.<br>
Heterocarbyl: The term "heterocarbyl" is used herein throughout the specification to mean a unit comprising from 3 to 20 carbon atoms wherein at least one atom in the main chain, or ring is a heteroatom.

EMBODIMENTS<br>
The following are additional non-limiting embodiments of the present invention. Skin Conditioning Lotions<br>
An example of a skin care composition of the present invention comprises an ester having a total number of carbon atoms in excess of about 28, for example lauryl laurate, lauryl myristate, myristyl myristate, behenyl caprate, cetearyl palmitate, behenyl stearate, more preferably cetearyl palmitate and cetyl stearate.<br>
The present compositions in addition to the esters described herein above, contain an emollient material in an amount such that the amount of ester plus emollient is from about 0.2%,<br><br>
preferably from about 4% to about 25%, preferably to about 18% of the total composition. One function of the emollient is to ensure that the ester is plasticized sufficiently to allow it to be in a film-like state on the skin. The emollient in the present compositions is selected from the group consisting of fatty alcohols, esters having fewer than about 24 total carbon atoms (e.g. isopropyl palmitate), branched chain esters having greater than about 24 total carbon atoms (e.g. cetearyl octonate), squalane, liquid or solid paraffins, mixtures of fatty acids and squalane, mixtures of fatty acids and liquid or solid paraffins and mixtures thereof. The aforementioned esters, those having fewer than 24 carbon atoms or branched and having more than 24 carbon atoms, if used as an emollient should preferably be used in an mount-equal to about a third of the long chain ester. The particular emollient selected depends in part on the particular ester selected since proper plasticization, as indicated above, is desired. The emollient for the esters having more than 28 carbon atoms is preferably selected from the group consisting of squalane, liquid or solid paraffins and mixtures of fatty alcohols with squalane or paraffins. Typical fatty alcohols and fatty acids useful in the present compositions include those having from 12-22 carbon atoms such as ceryl alcohol, myristyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol, stearic acid and palmitic acid. Paraffins include, for example, mineral oil, petrolatum and paraffin wax. It is preferred that distilled water be used in the present compositions.<br>

(e)	Polyalkylenes such as hydrogenated polyisobutene and polyethylene; and<br>
(f)	Sterols such as cholesterol and phytosterol.<br>
These optional oil phase materials may comprise up to about 80% of the oil phase, preferably up to about 35%. When used at these levels, the optional components do not impair the occlusive nature of the compositions and add to the composition's total cosmetic performance.<br>
Water Phase Components<br><br>
The water phase of the compositions may contain many different materials including:<br>
(a)	Humectants, such as sorbitol, glycerine, propylene glycol, alkoxylated glucose and hexanetriol at a level of from about 1% to about 20%.<br>
(b)	Thickening agents such as carboxyvinyl polymers, ethyl cellulose, polyvinyl alcohol, carboxymethyl cellulose, vegetable gums and clays such as Veegum.RTM. (magnesium aluminum silicate, R. T. Vanderbilt, Inc.) at a level of from about 0.01% to about 6%;<br>
(c)	Proteins and polypeptides at a level of from about 0.1% to about 3%;<br>
(d)	Preservatives such as the methyl, ethyl, propyl and butyl esters of hydroxybenzoic acid (Parabens-Mallinckrodt Chemical Corporation) EDTA and imidazolidinyl urea (Germall 115-Sutton Laboratories) at a level of from about 0.2% to about 2.5%; and<br>
(e)	An alkaline agent such as sodium hydroxide to neutralize, if desired, part of the fatty acids or thickener which may be present.<br>
All of the percentages of these additional water phase components are of the total composition.<br>
The present compositions may also contain agents suitable for aesthetic purposes such as dyes. The compositions of the present invention are preferably substantially free of materials that adversely affect their performance. Therefore, such things as polyethylene glycols are preferably present only at levels below about 1% of the total composition. The pH of the present compositions is preferably in the range of about 7.5-10.<br>
METHOD OF MANUFACTURE The compositions which comprise the skin lotion embodiments of the present invention generally have a lotion consistency and may be in the form of oil-m-water or water-in-oil emulsions with the former being preferred because of their more pleasing cosmetic properties. The compositions of the present invention are preferably made by the method comprising the steps of;<br>
a)	preparing the oil phase;<br>
b)	preparing the water phase; and<br>
c)	adding the oil phase to the water phase.<br>
Step (a) is carried out by heating the oil phase materials to a temperature of about 75Â° C to about 100Â° C. Step (b) is carried out by heating the water phase materials to a temperature about the same as that of the oil phase. The emulsion is formed by slowly adding the oil phase prepared in step (a) to the water phase prepared in step (b) with stirring. The pro-accords which comprise the fragrance delivery system or other ingredients may be added to the phase in which they are soluble prior to the mixing of the two phases or added directly to the mixed water and oil phases.<br><br>
In addition to the fragrance-containing compositions for use on human skin, the pro-accords of the present invention are also suitable for use in any odor controlling or fragrance mediating application. An example of this odor control capacity is animal litter and odor control articles useful in lining the cages, stalls, and other living areas of domesticated animals. For example, U.S. 5,339,769 Toth et al, issued August 23,1994 describes a process for making an absorbent composition, which can well accommodate the pro-accord materials of the present invention.<br>
An example of a suitable litter material which comprises the pro-accords of the present invention can be formed by the following process.<br>
A Glatt fluid bed granulator is charged with 1,0000 g of bentonite clay (90 % of the particles being greater than 420 microns) and 10 g of a cellulose ether (Methocel â¢ K15M Premium, a cellulose ether having a viscosity of 15,000 centipoise (cps) as a 2 % aqueous solution). The granulator is started and the product temperature is brought up to about 40Â° C (outlet temperature). When the outlet temperature reaches about 40Â° C, atomized water is sprayed onto the moving powders within the granulator. During the granulation process, inlet air temperature is maintained at 70Â° C to 80Â° C; air atomization pressure is 28-35 psi; and the spraying cycle is for 45 seconds with a 15 second shaking time.<br>
The clay/cellulose ether agglomerates swell over time. The water hydrates the cellulose ether polymer, which produces adhesion to form the granule. At this time it is more advantageous to introduce the pro-accord materials and other aesthetic fragrances. The formation of the granule promotes aggregation of the small sized particles of the inert substrate, e.g. clay particles of about 50 to 600 microns. The formation of a granule significantly reduces the quality of dust in the final product while the litter forms an agglomerate when wetted.<br>
In an alternative embodiment of the clay-based litter box articles/pro-accord admixture, once the clay particles have been formed, a concentrated solution, or a carrier alcohol-based admixture of the pro-accords may be delivered to the surface of the granule by a suitable means.<br><br>
A deodorant gel stick of the present invention having the composition given below, and being essentially free of water, is prepared as follows.<br>
