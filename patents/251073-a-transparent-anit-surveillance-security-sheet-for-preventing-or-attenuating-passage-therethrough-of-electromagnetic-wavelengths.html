				<td>A SYSTEM AND METHODS FOR FILTERING ELECTROMAGNETIC VISUAL, AND MINIMIZING ACOUSTIC TRANSMISSIONS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to a system and method for filtering electromagnetic and visual transmissions, and for minimizing acoustic transmissions for security purposes. More specifically, the invention provides a system and method to prevent unauthorized data collection and information exchange from or within buildings (such as through windows, doorways, other fenestration, or openings) or otherwise prevent such unauthorized data collection and information exchange from, for example, computer monitors or screens, personal digital assistants, and local area networks.<br>
Discussion of Related Art<br>
Electromagnetic radiation of various frequencies is radiated from many devices used in a wide range of facilities including homes, workplaces such as offices, manufacturing and military installations, ships, aircraft and other structures. Examples of such devices include computers, computer monitors, computer keyboards, radio equipment, communication devices, etc. If this radiation escapes from the facility, it can be intercepted and analyzed for the purpose of deciphering data associated with or encoded in the escaped radiation. For example, technology exists for reconstructing the image appearing on a computer monitor in a building from a remote location outside the building or from a location within a building by detecting certain wavelength frequencies from the monitor screen even if the monitor screen is not in view from the remote location. This is accomplished by known techniques wherein certain frequencies of light from the monitor screen, even after being reflected from various surfaces inside the building or room where the monitor is located, escape and are intercepted and analyzed<br><br>
by an eavesdropper in another location outside the building or room where the monitor is located. Obviously, the ability of an eavesdropper to intercept such radiation constitutes a significant security risk, which is desirably eliminated from facilities where secrecy is essential.<br>
Although walls, such as brick, masonry block or stone walls may effectively prevent the escape of light frequencies from a facility, radio frequencies pass through walls that are not properly grounded to prevent such passage. Moreover, windows or other openings allow the passage of radiation to the outside where it can be intercepted, and permit entry of various forms of radiation, such as laser beams, infrared, and radio frequencies, into the facility. As a result, sensitive or secret data may be gathered from within the structure.<br>
Indeed, the United States Government has long been concerned by the fact that electronic equipment, such as computers, printers, and electronic typewriters, give off electronic emanations. The TEMPEST (an acronym for Transient Electromagnetic Pulse Emanation Standard) program was created to introduce standards that would reduce the chances of leakage of emanations from devices used to process, transmit, or store sensitive information. This is typically done by either designing the electronic equipment to reduce or eliminate transient emanations, or by shielding the equipment (or sometimes a room or entire building) with copper or other conductive materials. Both alternatives can be extremely expensive.<br>
The elimination of windows and other openings from a structure would obviously minimize the above-noted security risk. The disadvantages of a windowless or enclosed structure, however, are self-evident. It would be highly desirable, therefore, to prevent the escape of radiation associated with data through windows, doorways, or other openings while allowing other radiation to pass there-through so that the enjoyment of the visual effects provided by such openings can be obtained without an undue security risk.<br><br>
In addition to the security risks associated with the passage of certain wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation, acoustic transmission through a window, door or other opening also poses a security risk. It would be of additional benefit if transmission of both acoustic and the aforementioned electromagnetic radiation through openings could be minimized or avoided while preserving the visual benefits provided thereby.<br>
The need for reducing the undesirable effects of the sun—its heat, excessive energy usage, glare, and ultraviolet (UV) radiation—has led to the development of solar control window films. Solar control window films are thin polyester sheets, which are mounted on the glass windows of buildings and automobiles via an adhesive. It is said that such films are effective in providing comfort, visibility, and increased energy efficiency.<br>
In the current workplace or home environment, however, there is a need for more protection than solar control films can provide. For example, it is important to protect the work product of an individual, business, or other entity from unauthorized data collection through the glass windows or other openings of their offices. The conventional solar control films described above are, for the most part, incapable of rejecting the wide range of frequencies used for such unauthorized data and information exchange.<br>
Given the importance of security in today's competitive marketplace, a system that could preserve the privacy of the workplace is very desirable. Such a system would provide both comfort and security, which in turn can bring about many benefits, including increased productivity and the preservation of confidentiality in both the public and private sectors.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a system and method for filtering electromagnetic, visual, and minimizing acoustic transmissions bv using a combination of filters which substantially obviates one or more of the problems due to the limitations and disadvantages of the related art. The invention further provides a system and methods whereby a combination of films has a shielding effectiveness which attenuates the transmission of radio frequency wavelengths there-through and provides effective filtering of UV and IR light with good visible light transmission (VLT) without undesirable color characteristics.<br>
To achieve these and other advantages and in accordance with the purpose of the present invention, as embodied and broadly described, the system and methods of the present invention include a combination of electromagnetic radiation filters, such as selective radiation absorbers and/or selective radiation reflectors. These may be part of a window. The system and methods according to the invention have, however, non-exclusionary applications; the invention can be interposed between glass surfaces or applied to every type of glazing. The system and methods according to the invention can also be used for free standing product application for computer screens, monitors and other stand-alone devices. Further, the system and methods according to the invention may be configured to form a separate covering, which may be placed over computer screens, monitors and other stand-alone devices. The example of windows discussed herein is employed for convenience and is not intended to be limiting as to surface application.<br>
The radiation filters of the combination may be individual or combined layers plied to a window in any sequence so that light, which passes through the window, passes through the radiation filters used in the combination. The radiation filters may be applied on any surface of the glazing (i.e., glass or other transparent material used for windows) of the window to form a multilayered structure of the filters on the glazing. It<br><br>
is not essential for all the layers to be contiguous to each other on one surface of the glazing. Instead, the filters may be distributed in any manner over or in the glazing of a window so as to prevent the passage of the wavelengths which would pose a security risk if they were allowed to pass through the window. For example, one filter may be on one surface of a glass pane while the remaining filters may be distributed as a single or multilayer structure on another surface of the glass layer (e.g., glass pane) or the filters may be distributed on any of the surfaces of a plurality of glass layers of a window (e.g., a multi-glazed window structure such as a double or triple glazed window structure).<br>
In addition, any or all of the filters may be used in conjunction with a conventional glass interlayer such as the glass interlayer used in conventional safety glass which comprises a plastic interlayer such as polyvinylbutyral (PVB) interposed between two glass layers. The filters may be incorporated in, deposited on, or laminated to or within the interlayer in which case the filters will be within the glazing of the window.<br>
Each filter of the combination of filters is advantageously in the form of an individual layer or coating, but this is not essential. In the case of filters which are absorbers (filters which use a particular dye, metal, metal salt or pigment to absorb a desired wavelength or range of wavelengths), the entire combination of absorbers or a portion of the combination may be in the form of a mixture of dyes, metal, metal salt or pigments in a single layer as a coating or may be incorporated in a component of the window such as in the polyvinylbutyral interlayer used in safety glass or in an adhesive layer used to adhere film, sheets or the like to the glass. It is also possible to incorporate one or more of the absorbers as a mixture in a film or sheet attached to the window or as layers applied to or coated onto a film or sheet. The PVB layer or the adhesive layer may include electrically conductive panicles therein in an amount to render the PVB or the adhesive conductive.<br><br>
The film or sheet may be any of the films or sheets used to make conventional solar control films. An example of a film used for this purpose includes, polyethylene terephthalate (PET), but others may be used as well.<br>
When a film or sheet is used in combination with glass, it is not essential for the entire combination of filters to be in or on the film or sheet. For example, one or more filters may be associated with the film or sheet as described above while any remaining filters may be connected to the glass as described above or vice versa. It is also possible to include a layer which comprises a mixture of absorbers with another layer which is a different filter to make the desired combination. For example, two absorbers such as dyes or pigments of the combination may be used as a mixture as two filters of the combination, and another filter of the combination may be in the form of a distinct layer or coating such as a metal reflecting or absorbing layer.<br>
Moreover, it is not essential for the entire combination of filters to be distributed on the same surface. For example, one or more of the filters may be applied to the glazing of a window while remaining filters may be applied to computer screens or monitors, personal digital assistants, or other stand-alone devices.<br>
It is also not essential for the combination of filters to be attached to a surface of a window, computer screen or monitor, personal digital assistant or other stand-alone device. For example, the combination of filters may be configured to form a separate covering, which may be soft and pliable, such as a bag. In this embodiment the combination of filters may be advantageously attached to a clear or transparent flexible substrate (e.g., PET sheet or film) which may be configured into the shape of a bag. When configured as a separate covering such as a bag, the combination of filters may be placed over computer screens or monitors, personal digital assistants, or other standalone devices, may be easily used and removed, and preferably may be disposable. Alternatively, the separate covering may be in the form of a tent or sheet, thereby covering an entire workstation, such as an outdoor or mobile workstation.<br><br>
Any coatings, layers, films, sheets, lamina or the like used in this invention may be applied to a component of the window (e.g., the glass or interlayer component) by techniques which are conventional and well known to those skilled in the an. For example, metal layers may be applied by conventional sputtering techniques or evaporative coatings techniques. Any of the various layers may be adhered to the glass by means of conventional adhesives.<br>
Although glass is described herein as the typical material which is used to make a window, it is to be understood that other clear or transparent materials which are useful for making windows may be substituted for the glass. For example hard plastics such as polycarbonate, plexiglass, acrylic plastic, etc., may be used as a substitute for the glass.<br>
In view of the above, it will be appreciated by one skilled in the art that the required combination of filters may be associated with the window in any manner or sequence providing they are configured to prevent passage of the critical wavelengths there-through for achieving the above-described security feature. Optionally additional conventional components or layers may be applied to the window to improve the aesthetics and/or visual characteristics of the window or to provide additional solar control, anti-reflection or radiant heat exclusion or safety and security characteristics in accordance with known techniques.<br>
The desired effect of the present invention (i.e., filtering the passage of certain wavelengths through the window) can be achieved with any type of light filter or light valve which prevents the passage of the selected wavelengths. Thus, for example, the light filters or light valves used in this invention may be any of the absorbers described above or any other type of light filter or light valve such as a wavelength selective reflective layer or any combination of different types of light filters and light valves. For example, light absorbers may be combined with reflective layers.<br><br>
It will be appreciated that the filters used in this invention are selective with respect to the wavelengths being filtered and thus the glazing remains sufficiently transparent for use as a window. Sufficient transparency is achieved by allowing visible light transmission of at least 1 %, although higher visible light transmission of at least about 25 - 30% is preferred, with 50%-70% being more preferred.<br>
The combination of filters are advantageously connected to a transparent substrate and are configured so as to exclude the passage of the selected wavelengths therethrough, such as by absorption and/or reflection of the selected wavelengths. Thus, uncoated or exposed areas, which would permit the passage of the selected wavelengths, should be avoided.<br>
Although the filters are connected to the substrate, each filter does not have to be directly connected to the substrate. In other words, the connection of a filter layer may be made by connecting the filter layer to another filter layer which was previously connected to the substrate so that one filter layer is connected to the substrate via another filter layer. For example, when two filter layers are located on one side of the substrate, one filter layer is directly connected to the substrate while the other filter layer is connected to the substrate via the first filter layer (i.e., indirectly connected). The same applies in instances where more than two filter layers are connected to one side of the substrate. In other words, being connected to the substrate in this invention is intended to cover both direct and indirect connections. Also, when a filter is formed by mixing or impregnating absorbents such as dyes or pigments into a component, the filter comprised of dye and/or pigment is considered in the context of this invention as being connected to the component.<br>
Instead of coating the filter as a layer on the substrate, the filter may be connected to the substrate by a lamination process wherein a previously formed filter layer is laminated onto the substrate either directly or indirectly.<br><br>
The substrate may be the glazing of the window or may be a flexible transparent sheet (e^, plastic sheets such as PET) which is then connected to the glazing. A portion of the combination of filters may be connected to the glazing and another portion of the combination of filters may be connected to one or more flexible transparent sheets, which are connected to the glazing. Alternatively the flexible transparent substrate with the combination of filters attached thereto may be configured as a bag to contain a computer screen or monitor, personal digital assistant or other stand alone device placed therein. Preferably the bag is sealed or tightly closed with the computer screen or monitor, digital assistant or other stand alone device therein so that the wavelengths to be filtered will not escape from the bag. The flexible substrate with the combination of filters attached thereto may also be configured as a tent for temporary field applications so that personnel and the computer screen or monitor, etc., may be inside the tent. In use the tent should cover the personnel and equipment inside to prevent leakage of the wavelengths which are to be filtered.<br>
All of the filters do not have to be applied to a single substrate. For example, in a multi-glazed window, the combination of filters may be distributed on one or more of the glass sheets of the glazing either as a coating or layer on the glass and on one or more sheets connected to the glass.<br>
At least one of the filters may be advantageously electrically conductive to inhibit the passage of radio waves through the window.<br>
The substrate may include other conventional solar control elements such as light absorbing layers, anti-reflecting layers, or reflectors thereon.<br>
The system and method may also be used as a Glass-fragmentation Safety Film and, as such, may be used to minimize flying glass fragments in real world situations. To accomplish this objective the flexible sheet may include one or more layers which inhibit glass fragments from becoming dangerous flying projectiles when the window<br><br>
breaks due to explosion, implosion, or due to force from a projectile. A suitable layer for this purpose is polyester film (e.g., PET) or other flexible clear film. For example a 7 mil thick PET film is adequate for this purpose. The PET film may be adhered to the film containing the combination of filters with an adhesive (e.g., a pressure sensitive adhesive such as a acrylic pressure sensitive adhesive or any of the other adhesives described herein). A suitable acrylic pressure sensitive adhesive includes Gelva 263 available from UCB Inc. which includes 8% by weight of benzophenone type UV absorber for light stability. The pressure sensitive adhesive may be coated at a rate of 4 lbs. per ream coat rate.<br>
The film used to provide glass fragmentation protection should be located on the glass surface of a window which is in the interior of the building to prevent glass fragments from causing injury to occupants in the building.<br>
The invention encompasses an improved combination of filters which provides high visible light transmission and low electrical resistance (less than 4 ohms/square) for enhanced attenuation of electromagnetic interference (EMI) and enhanced attenuation of radio frequency interference (RFI) as well as effective filtering of UV and IR light. Some embodiments of the improved combination of filters provided by this invention are particularly useful for shields which are applied to plasma display screens and other display screens which emit large amounts of EMI/RFI, UV light or IR light. The shields provide the monitor with a security feature which is useful for preventing unauthorized surveillance of the display screen.<br>
The invention also provides for the selection of various combinations of filters to customize the anti-surveillance security features to suit a particular need. This is because the combination of filters which affords the highest level of anti-surveillance security typically produces light transmission characteristics which are not aesthetically pleasing when used on a window. Not everyone needs such a high level of security which would necessitate compromising visual aesthetics.  For many applications, e.g., business and<br><br>
home use, it may be desirable to provide an acceptable level of security for many applications without compromising visual aesthetics.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION AND PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.<br>
As noted above, the light filters may be sequenced or distributed in any manner. Figure 1 illustrates an embodiment wherein film layers 1, 2 and 3 (which are light filters<br><br>
used in the present invention) are connected to one side of substrate 4. Figure 2 illustrates an alternative embodiment wherein film layers 1 and 2 are connected to one side of the substrate 4 while film layer 3 is connected to the other side of substrate 4. In a further embodiment illustrated in figure 3, the window glazing which serves as the substrate comprises two separate spaced-apart glass sheets 5 and 6. Film layers 1 and 2 are attached to either side of glass sheet 5 while film layer 3 is attached to glass sheet 6. Film layer 3 in figure 3 may be attached to either side of sheet 6. In a further embodiment illustrated in figure 4, the substrate upon which the films are connected may be a standard safety glass which includes PVB interlayer 7 interposed between glass sheets 5 and 6. Film layers 3 and 2 are connected to glass sheet 5 and film layer 1 is connected to glass sheet 6. It is also possible to connect any or all of film layers 1, 2 and 3 to PVB interlayer 7.<br>
The above described versatility concerning the sequence and distribution of a combination of three light filters used in the present invention is also applicable to other embodiments of the invention which use less or more than 3 light filters in the combination.<br>
One of the light filters of the combination may be a metal or a metal stack comprising an electrically conductive metal layer which is optionally interposed between two nickel/chrome alloy layers. The electrically conductive metal layer preferably has at least the electrical conductivity of aluminum or higher, and more preferably has at least the electrical conductivity of copper or higher. Most preferably the electrically conductive metal is copper. The nickel chrome alloy is utilized to provide corrosion protection for the electrically conductive metal and may be omitted if the anti-corrosion benefit is not desired. Other anti-corrosion metals or metal alloys such as stainless steel may be substituted for one or both the nickel/chrome alloy layers. It is also possible to provide the nickel/chrome alloy or an anti-corrosion metal or metal alloy on only one side of the electrically conductive metal layer. The nickel/chrome alloy layers may include a Hastelloy alloy or an Inconel alloy, which are well known to those skilled in<br><br>
the art.   An example of a Hastelloy alloy includes Hastelloy C276. which has the characteristics shown in table 1.<br><br><br><br><br>
An example of an Inconel alloy includes Inconel 600 which has the characteristics 5      shown in table 2.<br><br><br><br><br>
Another light filter which may be used in this invention includes a heat reflecting film. The heat reflecting film may be a sputtered metal/oxide stack described in U.S. Patent No. 6,007,901 on a polyester (PET) film with UV absorbers dyed into it at 2.4 absorbance manufactured by the dyeing process described in U.S. Patent No. 6,221,112. The disclosures of the aforementioned U.S. Patent Nos. 6,007,901 and 6,221,112 are incorporated herein by reference. Alternatively any of the heat reflecting metal/oxide stacks described herein may be coated onto any component of window glazing to thereby eliminate the need of a plastic film. In other words the metal/oxide stack may be deposited onto any component of window glazing (e.g., coated directly or indirectly onto the glass of window glazing) without first coating the metal/oxide stack onto a film (e.g.,<br><br>
polyester film) and then adhering the metal/oxide coated film onto the window glazing.<br>
Any of the heat reflecting films which are well known to those skilled in the an may be used in this invention. Such heat reflecting films generally comprise multiple stacks of discrete layers which are deposited onto a substrate such as a plastic film or glass. Each stack has in sequence a thin film of dielectric material (e.g., metal oxide) and a heat reflecting metal such as silver, gold, copper or alloys thereof. Substantially transparent conductive metal compounds (e.g., metal oxides) such as indium tin oxide may be used as the dielectric.<br>
The heat reflecting film may comprise in sequence; (a) a substantially transparent substrate; (b) a first outer dielectric layer; (c) an infrared reflecting metal layer; (d) a color correcting metal layer comprising a metal different from the infrared reflecting metal layer; (e) a protective metal layer comprising a metal different from the infrared reflecting metal layer and different from the color correcting layer; (f) one or more subcomposite layers each comprising: (i) a subcomposite inner dielectric layer; (ii) a subcomposite infrared reflecting metal layer; (iii) a subcomposite color correcting metal layer comprising a metal different from the subcomposite infrared reflecting metal layer; and (iv) a subcomposite protective metal layer comprising a metal different from the subcomposite infrared reflecting metal layer and different from the subcomposite  color  correcting   layer;   and   (g)   a   second   outer  dielectric   layer.<br>
The dielectric layers are typically indium oxide, indium zinc oxide, indium tin oxide or mixtures thereof. However other metal oxides may be substituted for the above-mentioned oxides. Suitable oxides for use as the dielectric layer include metal oxides having an index of refraction in the range of 1.7-2.6. The thickness of the outside dielectric layers is typically between about 0.15 quarter wave optical thickness and about 1 quarter wave optical thickness.<br>
The infrared reflecting metal layers are typically silver, gold, copper or alloys thereof and are laid down in a thickness of between 7 nm and about 25 run. The color<br><br>
correcting metal layers preferably have a refractive index between about 0.6 and about 4 and an extinction coefficient for light in the visible range between about 1.5 and about 7. The color correcting metal layers most preferably consist essentially of indium.<br>
The protective metal layers are made from a metal whose oxide is substantially-optically non-absorbing, such as aluminum, titanium, zirconium, niobium, hafnium, tantalum, tungsten and alloys thereof. The protective metal layers typically have a thickness between about 1 nm and about 5 nm.<br>
The heat reflecting film may also be a composite comprising in sequence: (a) a substantially transparent substrate; (b) a first outer dielectric layer; (c) an infrared reflecting metal layer; (d) a color correcting metal layer comprising a metal different from the infrared reflecting metal layer; (e) a protective metal layer comprising a metal different from the infrared reflecting metal layer and different from the color correcting layer; (f) a second outer dielectric layer; and (g) a substantially transparent top layer comprising a substantially transparent glass or polymeric material.<br>

Finally, it is preferable that the layers of the heat reflecting film be so assembled so that the composite transmits and reflects visible light in "neutral colors" or "slightly blueish or sreenish" transmission colors. Transmissions which are neutral in color are those which transmit visible light in equal intensities throughout the visible spectrum. Light transmitted with a slightly blueish or slightly greenish tint is light whose components with wave lengths in the 380-580 nm range are slightly higher in intensity than other wave lengths.<br>

A preferred heat reflector film for use in this invention is made by sputter coating the following sequence of layers onto a PET film with UV absorbers dyed into it at 2.4 absorbance:<br>
a first layer of indium tin oxide about 30 nm thick coated on said PET film,<br>
a first layer of silver/copper alloy about 9 nm thick (92.5 wt. % Ag and 7.5 wt.<br>
% Cu) coated on said first layer of indium tin oxide,<br>
a layer of indium metal about 3 nm thick coated on said first silver/copper alloy,<br>
a first layer of titanium metal about 1 nm thick coated on said indium,<br>
a layer of indium tin oxide about 80 nm thick coated on said titanium,<br>
a second layer of silver/copper alloy about 9 nm thick (92.5 wt. % Ag and 7.5<br>
wt. % Cu) coated on said indium tin oxide,<br>
a layer of indium metal about 2 nm thick coated on said second silver/copper<br>
alloy,<br>
a second layer of titanium metal about 1 nm thick coated on said 2 nm layer of<br>
indium, and a second layer of indium tin oxide about 30 nm thick coated on<br>
said second layer of titanium.<br>
The layer of titanium functions as a protective sacrificial layer which prevents oxidation of the indium metal layer during the sputter coating of the indium tin oxide<br>
layer.<br>
Alternatively the PET film may be eliminated and the above sequence of layers may be coated onto a component (e.g., glass) of window glazing.<br>
The above preferred heat reflector has a sheet resistance which is less than 17 ohms/square.<br>
Some embodiments of the invention utilize the metal or metal stack which comprises an electrically conductive metal such as copper optionally interposed between the two nickel/chrome layers as well as the heat reflecting sputtered metal/oxide stack.<br><br>
When both of these filters are employed, they may be replaced by a filter having the electromagnetic filtering properties of the XIR-70 film or the XIR-75 film shown in table 3. The XIR-70 and XIR-75 films have an IR transmission at wavelengths between 780 run and 2500 nm of no more than 50%, and preferably of less than 20%, and more preferably of about 15%. XIR-70 and XIR 75 films are commercially available from Southwall Technologies. XIR-70 film and the XIR-75 films are well known components of glass tint used in original equipment laminated automotive glass. Table 3 shows the characteristics of this type of tinted glass and, more particularly, table 3 shows the properties of XIR-70 film and XIR-75 film which may be used in the present invention as part of the overall combination of filters. An example of the XIR film may be about 2 mil. thick; have a visible light transmittance of about 60-70%, a visible reflectance (exterior) of about 9%; a total solar transmittance of about 46%; and a solar reflectance (exterior) of about 22%. The surface resistance of an exemplitive XIR-70 film used in this invention is about 6.0 ohms/square.<br>
Preferably the XIR-70 or XIR-75 film further includes an electrically conductive metal layer (e.g., copper or silver) to produce a sheet resistance which is less than 4 ohms/square.<br><br><br>
In a preferred embodiment, an improved anti-surveillance devices and system may be obtained by replacing the aforementioned metal stack (nickel chrome alloy/copper/nickel chrome alloy) and the heat reflecting metal/oxide stack with a high visible light transmission/low resistance (less than 4 ohms/square) filter in the combination of filters.<br>
Most broadly the high visible light transmission/low resistance (less than 4 ohms/square) filter is a stack which is either an IR reflecting metal layer sandwiched between two dielectric layers or a dielectric layer sandwiched between two IR reflecting metal layers. The above-noted stack is coated onto a component of window glazing or onto a transparent plastic sheet such as PET.<br>
The dielectric of each of the dielectric layers in the aforementioned stack has an index of refraction in the range of about 1.35 to about 2.6. Preferably the dielectric is a metal oxide dielectric having an index of refraction in the range of about 1.7 to about 2.6.<br>
The above-described high visible light transmission/low resistance (less than 4 ohms/square) filter is preferably a Ag/Ti stack or a Ag/Au stack as described below.<br>
The Ag/Ti stack may be a multilayered structure containing the following sequence of layers coated (preferably sputter coated) onto a component of window glazing or onto a transparent plastic sheet which is preferably polyethylene terephthalate (PET):<br>
1.	a layer of indium tin oxide which is preferably 30 nm thick<br>
2.	a silver IR reflecting layer which is preferably about 9 nm thick<br>
3.	a protective sacrificial layer of titanium about 1 nm thick<br>
4.	a layer of indium tin oxide which is preferably about 70 nm thick<br>
5.	a silver IR reflecting layer preferably about 9 nm thick<br>
6.	a protective sacrificial layer of titanium preferably about 1 nm thick<br>
7.	an indium tin oxide layer preferably about 70 nm thick<br><br>
8.	a silver IR reflecting layer preferably about 9 nm thick<br>
9.	a protective sacrificial layer of titanium preferably about 1 nm thick<br>
10.	a layer of indium tin oxide preferably about 30 nm thick<br>
The indium tin oxide layers in the Ag/Ti stack has an index of refraction of about 2.0. The thickness of the silver layers may be adjusted to achieve the desired ohms per square for the above-described multilayered strucrure. The above-described multi-layered structure has a sheet resistance which is less than 4 ohms per square.<br>
Preferably the Ag/Ti stack has a sheet resistance which is less than 2.5 ohms/square. An Ag/Ti stack having a sheet resistance less than 2.5 ohms/square is exemplified by a stack containing the following sequence of layers sputtered onto a component of window glazing or onto a transparent plastic sheet which is preferably PET:<br>
1.	a coating of indium tin oxide about 30 nm thick,<br>
2.	a silver IR reflecting layer which is about 11 nm thick,<br>
3.	a protective sacrificial layer of titanium about 1 nm thick,<br>
4.	a layer of indium tin oxide about 75 nm thick,<br>
5.	a silver IR reflecting layer which is about 13 nm thick,<br>
6.	a protective sacrificial layer of titanium about 1 nm thick,<br>
7.	an indium tin oxide layer about 70 nm thick,<br>
8.	a silver IR reflecting layer about 11 nm thick,<br>
9.	a protective sacrificial layer of titanium about 1 nm thick, and<br>
10.	a layer of indium tin oxide which is about 30 nm thick.<br>
The Ag/Ti stack having the lower sheet resistance of less than 2.5 ohms per square provides lower electrical resistance, higher IR rejection at the 800 and above nm range with a visible light transmission of 70%. Using the Ag/Ti stack having a sheet resistance which is less than 2.5 ohms/square, results in a filter which is less dark, more conductive and which provides greater IR rejection compared to the filter containing the<br><br>
nickel-chrome alloy/copper/nickel-chrome alloy layered structure with the metal/oxide heat reflecting film.<br>
The protective sacrificial layer of titanium will be oxidized to TiOz when the indium tin oxide layers are deposited to thereby prevent the indium tin oxide layer from<br>
oxidizing the silver.<br>
The layers used in the Ag/Ti and Ag/Au stack may be sputter coated using any conventional sputter coating technique. For example the indium tin oxide layer in the Ag/Ti sputtered stack may be sputtered in an argon and oxygen environment and the metals in the Ag/Ti stack may be deposited in a pure argon environment.<br>
The above described Ag/Ti stack has a visible light transmission (VLT) of about 65-69% T550 (i.e. percentage of VLT measured using light having a wavelength of 550nm).<br>
The Ag/Au stack is also a multilayered structure coated (preferably sputter coated) onto a component of window glazing or onto a clear plastic sheet such as PET and preferably contains the following sequence of layers:<br>
1.	A layer of indium tin oxide (ITO) preferably about 30 nm thick<br>
2.	a silver IR reflecting layer preferably about 9 nm thick<br>
3.	a layer of gold about 1 nm thick<br>
4.	an ITO layer preferably about 70 nm thick<br>
5.	a silver IR reflecting layer preferably about 9 nm thick<br>
6.	a layer of gold preferably about 1 nm thick<br>
7.	an ITO layer preferably about 70 nm thick<br>
8.	a silver IR reflecting layer preferably about 9 nm thick<br>
9.	a gold layer preferably about 1 nm thick<br>
10.	an ITO layer preferably about 30 nm thick<br><br>
The ITO layers in the above-described Ag/Au stack has a refractive index of about 2.0. The thickness of the silver layers may be varied to regulate the ohms per square for the above-described multilayered structure. The above-described multilayered structure has a sheet resistance which is less than 4 ohms per square.<br>
The gold layers in the Ag/Au stack serve as a protective layer for the silver, but unlike the corresponding Ti layers in the Ag/Ti stack, the gold layers are not oxidized.<br>
The ITO may be sputtered in an argon and oxygen environment while the metals may be deposited in a pure argon environment.<br>
In both of the above described Ag/Ti and Ag/Au stacks, layer 1 (the first ITO layer) is first sputter coated onto a component of window glazing or onto the clear plastic sheet and the remaining layers 2-10 are sequentially sputter coated in the order indicated above.<br>
In both of the above described Ag/Ti and Ag/Au stacks, any or all of the indium tin oxide layers may be substituted with any dielectric layer having an index of refraction in the range of about 1.35 to about 2.6, preferably a metal oxide dielectric having an index of refraction in the range of about 1.7 to about 2.6.<br>
Another filter which may be used in the combination of filters is an IR absorbing filter which is a layer comprising an IR absorbing substance such as a layer of LaBe (lanthanum hexaboride) or other IR absorbing material such as antimony tin oxide. A preferred IR absorbing filter contains a combination of LaBe and antimony tin oxide. The IR absorbing material is preferably in the form of nanoparticles incorporated into a coating material such as adhesive or hardcoat material. Nanoparticles are particles havine an averaee Darticle diameter of 200 nm or less. Dreferablv less than 100 nm.<br><br>
Examples of suitable IR absorbing filters include the IR absorbing filters described in United States published patent application no. US 2002/0090507 A1 and WO 02/41041 A2, the specifications of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The IR absorbing filters described in WO 02/41041 A2 and US 2002/0090507 A1 are optically active film composites which include a layer of resin binder having a thickness of less than 6 microns and a pencil hardness of at least 2H, preferably 3H, and include nanoparticles of at least one metallic compound absorbing light having a wavelength in the range of 1000-2500 nm and nanoparticles of a second metallic compound which is an inorganic compound and which absorbs light having a wavelength in the range of 700-1100 nm. Preferably the composite has a visible light transmission of at least 50% and a percent TSER of at least 35 %, and more preferably has a visible light transmission of at least 70%. For a composite having a visible light transmission in the range of 50-60% the percent TSER may be between 50-65 %.<br>
Pencil hardness is measured according to ASTM D3363-92a.<br>
Visible light transmission is calculated using CIE Standard Observer (CIE 1924 1931) and D65 Daylight.<br>
The percent TSER is the percentage total solar energy rejection which is calculated from optical and heat rejection properties of coated film measured on a Varian Analytical Cary 5 Spectrophotometer in accordance with ASTM E903-82, the absorption and transmission data being analyzed using parameters described by Perry Moon in the Journal of the Franklin Institute, Volume 230, pp. 583-618 (1940).<br>
Preferably one metallic compound is antimony tin oxide (ATO), indium tin oxide (ITO), or tin oxide.<br><br>
Preferably said one metallic compound is ATO and the layer contains 30-60% by weight of ATO, preferably 50-60% by weight of ATO.<br>
The second compound may be modified ITO as described in U.S. patent no. 5,807,511 and/or at least one of a metal hexaboride taken from the lanthanum series of the periodic table. The preferred hexaborides are La, Ce, Pr. Nd, Gb, Sm, and Eu with La being the most preferred option. The layer contains a maximum of 3% by weight of the second metallic compound, preferably less than 2% and more preferably between 0.5-2%.<br>
The binder may be a thermoplastic resin such as an acrylic resin, a thermosetting resin such as an epoxy resin, an electron beam curing resin, or preferably a UV curable resin which may be an acrylate resin of the type disclosed in U.S. patent no. 4,557,980, or preferably a urethane acrylate resin.<br>
The layer of resin binder may be coated to a transparent polymeric film substrate, preferably a polyester film which is more preferably PET film. The infrared blocking layer forms a hardcoat for the film substrate which is particularly advantageous and may cut out a further processing step during composite film manufacture. The PET film may be coated with an adhesive for fixing the film composite to the substrate used in this invention. The PET film and/or adhesive may include at least one UV radiation absorbing material to block out substantially all UV radiation to less than 1 % weighted UV transmission. Weighted UV transmission is derived from measurements made in accordance with ASTM E-424 and as modified by the Association of Industrial Metallisers, Coaters &amp; Laminators (AIMCAL). The above-mentioned IR absorption filter composites have low visible reflectivity of less than 10% and have excellent weatherability with no loss of absorption properties and holding color, after 1500 hours in a Weatherometer.<br><br>
The IR absorbing filter may include a transparent substrate coated with a layer of resin having a thickness of less than 6 microns and which contains nanoparticles of ATO and nanoparticles of a second metallic compound which is an inorganic compound which absorbs light having a wavelength in the range of 700-1100 nm and a second transparent substrate located on the layer of resin so that the layer of resin is sandwiched between the two substrates.<br>
Another filter which may be used in the combination of filters is a UV screening film. The UV screening film is advantageously a weatherable PET UV screening film which is preferably a PET film with UV absorbers dyed into it in an amount to produce at least 2.4 optical density (OD) absorbance. A suitable PET film includes the film manufactured by the dyeing process described in U.S. patent no. 6,221,112. One or two of the UV screening films may be used in the present invention. Instead of using a UV screening film, the UV absorbers may be incorporated into or on a component of window glazing.<br>
Conventional museum grade film comprises the combination of two layers of the aforementioned UV screening film. Thus, the museum grade film may be substituted for any of the embodiments of this invention which include two UV screening films in the overall combination of filters.<br>
The museum grade film has the wavelength transmission properties of figure 11. The museum grade film exhibits an increasing percentage of light transmission beginning about 380 nanometers as shown in figure 11. In one embodiment, the museum grade film exhibits light transmission percentages for various wavelengths as shown below in table 4.<br><br><br>
A film having the properties shown in figure 11 and in table 4 may have a percent light transmission at 320 nm and 380 nm which is less than 1 % of the transmission at 550 nm. In addition, the percent light transmission at 480 nm may be less than 50% of the transmission at 550 nm.<br>
A flexible transparent sheet made in accordance with this invention may also be used to minimize acoustic transmissions from a building by carefully applying the film to the window with an adhesive while making certain that no visible air bubbles are formed between the flexible sheet and the glazing of the window. The term "visible air bubbles" used herein means air bubbles which are visible without any magnification (i.e., visible to the naked eye). It has been discovered that when the transparent flexible sheet lies over an air bubble, the flexible sheet behaves like the diaphragm of a loudspeaker. This causes unwanted transmission of sound waves. Avoiding these bubbles minimizes the transmission of the sound waves through the window.<br>
The combination of filters used in this invention should cover the surface area of the entire window glazing or otherwise should be configured to minimize the passage of the selected wavelengths there-through unless the combination of filters is being used as a bag or tent. Thus, when the filters are applied to the glazing by adhering a flexible transparent sheet thereto, the flexible transparent sheet having the light filters thereon should be carefully positioned so that there are no gaps or unprotected areas on the glazing. In an embodiment, a single transparent flexible sheet having the filters thereon is employed to avoid seams between the edges of the flexible sheets on the glazing of a<br><br>
window. The avoidance of seams is beneficial because seams allow leakage of the wavelengths which the present invention seeks to avoid. This leakage through the seams occurs even when the edges of the flexible sheets are butted against one Another and even when the edges overlap one another.<br>
There is also a potential for leakage of the wavelengths around the periphery of the flexible sheet adjacent to the window frame. Turning to figure 5, leakage around the periphery may be minimized by applying an opaque electrically conductive sealant 22 around the periphery so that any gap 23 between the sheet 24 and the window frame 25 may be masked by the sealant. Thus, the sealant would cover any exposed portions of the glazing not covered by the sheet. Figure 5 illustrates sheet 24 adhered to glazing 26 of a standard window. The sealant may be neutral curing to avoid unwanted chemical interaction with the sheet. An example of suitable sealant includes a silicone elastomer, such as Dow Corning 995 Silicone Structural Adhesive.<br>
Preferably the flexible sheet is sized to avoid all gaps between sheet 24 and window frame 25. However it is not humanly possible to avoid all gaps between sheet 24 and window frame 25 due to small irregularities on the edges of sheet 24 and window frame 25. Thus sheet 24 should be sized so that the entire periphery of sheet 24 is in substantial contact with window frame 25. Substantial contact as used herein means as much contact as is humanly possible given the small irregularities on the edges of sheet 24 and window frame 25.<br>
A first combination of filters used in the present invention comprises the above described low resistant sputtered stack (either the Ag/Ti or the Ag/Au stack or the stacks having the sequence: dielectric layer/IR reflecting metal layer/dielectric layer or the sequence: IR reflecting metal layer/dielectric layer/IR reflecting metal layer) in combination with one or two UV screening films. An example of the first improved combination of filters is illustrated in figure 6.<br><br>
Turning to figure 6, this embodiment of the invention includes layers 27-32. Laver 27 is an adhesive for adhesivelv securing the multilavered structure to slazine of a window or to the display screen of a plasma monitor or other type of display screen.<br>
Layer 28 is a UV screening film.<br>
Layer 29 is either the Ag/Ti or the Ag/Au low resistance (less than 4 ohms/square, preferably less than 2.5 ohms per square) sputtered stack as described<br>
herein.<br>
Layer 30 is a laminating adhesive.<br>
Layer 31 is either a clear film or a UV screening film.<br>
Layer 32 is an optional hardcoat layer.<br>
The above-described first combination offers high visible light transmission and high EMI/RFI shielding attenuation. Thus the first combination may be applied to glazing of a window using adhesive layer 27 or may be adhered to the display screen of a plasma monitor or other display screen which emits large amounts of EMI/RFI, UV or IR.<br>
The embodiment shown in figure 6 may be assembled using conventional film making, coating and laminating procedures. For example Ag/Ti stack of layer 29 is formed on film 28 by conventional sputtering and hardcoat layer 32 is applied onto layer 31 using conventional hardcoating techniques either before or after lamination of the remaining layers. The entire multilayered structure is assembled into a laminate using conventional laminating adhesives and adhesive layer 27 is applied using conventional adhesive coating technology.<br><br>
A second combination of filters comprises the above-described Ag/Ti or the Ag/Au low resistance sputtered stack or the stacks having the sequence: dielectric layer IR reflecting metal layer/dielectric layer or the sequence: IR reflecting metal layer/dielectric layer/IR reflecting metal layer, the above-described IR absorbing layer which preferably comprises LaB6 and antimony tin oxide, and one or two UV screening films.  An example of the second improved combination is illustrated in figure 7.<br>
Turning to figure 7, this embodiment of the invention includes layers 27-33. Layers 27-32 may be the same material as layers 27-32 of figure 6. Layer 33 in figure 7 is the aforementioned IR absorbing layer which preferably comprises LaBe and antimony tin oxide.<br>
The second combination of filters such as the combination of filters exemplified in figure 7 provides improved IR rejection at the near IR wavelength range due to the incorporation of layer 33 therein. In addition, the second combination provides high EMI/RFI shielding attenuation and provides standard and high UV rejection. Standard UV rejection is provided by the embodiments of figures 6 and 7 wherein layer 31 is a clear film. Higher UV rejection is obtained when layer 31 is the UV screening film in the embodiment shown in figures 6 and 7.<br>
The example illustrated by figure 7 may be adhered to window glazing or to a plasma display screen or other type of display screen which emits large amounts of EMI/RFI or which emits large amounts of UV or IR light.<br>
The embodiment shown in figure 7 may be assembled using the same conventional film making, coating and laminating procedures as described for the embodiment of figure 6 but which further includes coating a layer of IR absorbing material (e.g., a layer comprising LaBe and antimony tin oxide) onto film 31.<br><br>
A third combination of filters utilized in this invention comprises the previously described sputtered metal or metal stack (electrically conductive metal such as copper optionally sandwiched between two corrosion protection layers), a heat reflecting sputtered stack (the previously described sputtered metal/oxide stack) and the UV screening material of layer 28 used in the example illustrated in figure 6. The third improved combination of filters is exemplified in figure 8 which includes the sequence of layers 27, 28, 30, 36, 30, 37, 30, 31 and 32. Layers 27, 28. 30, 31 and 32 in figure 8 are the same material as the corresponding numbered layers in the embodiment illustrated in figure 6. Layer 36 is the nickel/chrome alloy-copper-nickel/chrome alloy stack described herein. Preferably the nickel/chrome alloy is Hastelloy C276 alloy or the Inconel 600 alloy. Specific examples of Hastelloy C276 and Inconel 600 are described below:<br>
Hastelloy C276 having the following mechanical properties: UTI tensil psi: 106,000; yield psi: 43,000; elong. % 71.0; and having the following chemical analysis:<br><br><br>
Inconel 600 having the following mechanical properties: UTI tensil psi: 139,500; yield psi 60,900; elong. % 44.0; hardness: Rb85; and having the following chemical analysis:<br>

Layer 37 is a heat reflecting film. The heat reflecting film of layer 37 preferably includes a sputtered metal/oxide stack (described in U.S. patent no. 6,007,901) on a 1 mil. clear weatherable polyester (PET) film. The polyester film has UV absorbers dyed into it at at least 2.4 optical density absorbance. The film may be dyed using the dyeing process described in U.S. patent no. 6,221,112. Other films with UV screening capability may be used in place of the aforementioned UV screening film.<br>
The embodiment shown in figure 8 is assembled using the same conventional techniques employed in making the embodiments of figures 6 and 7. In particular, layer 36 is made by sputter coating the metal stack (copper layer interposed between two nickel/chrome alloy layers) onto a transparent plastic film such as a 1 mil PET film. Layer 37 is formed by sputter coating the metal-oxide stack onto a 1 mil clear weatherable PET film with UV absorbers dyed into it to produce at least 2.4 optical density absorbance. Layers 36 and 37 along with films 28 and 31 are laminated together using the laminating adhesive layers 30, and adhesive layer 27 is applied using conventional adhesive coating technology. Optional hardcoat layer 32 may be applied to<br><br>
film 31 using conventional hardcoat coating techniques either before or after lamination of the remaining layers.<br>
Each of the embodiments of the invention illustrated in Figures 6-8 advantageously includes a temporary release liner which covers an exposed surface of adhesive layer 27. Figure 9 illustrates the location of release liner 38 secured to adhesive layer 27. Reference numeral 39 in Figure 9 represents the various layers located below adhesive layer 27 in the embodiments shown in Figures 6-8. Removal of release liner 38 exposes adhesive layer 27 and thereby allows the combination of filters to be adhesively secured to a desired substrate 40 such as the glazing of a window or the screen of a computer monitor as illustrated in Fig. 10. A mechanical fastener may be used in place of an adhesive for securing the various embodiments of the invention to the screen of a computer monitor.<br>
The release liner 38 used in the various embodiments of this invention may be any conventional release liner known to those skilled in the art. For example, the release liner may be a 1 mil PET film with a silicone release coating thereon. Any suitable silicone release coating may be used, such as a tin catalyzed silicone release which has about 10 grams per inch release characteristic. Non-silicone release formulations may be substituted for the silicone release layer.<br>
The adhesive layer 27 used in the various embodiments of this invention may be any adhesive known to those skilled in the art for attaching a plastic sheet to glass. Pressure sensitive adhesives are particularly suitable for this purpose. A non-pressure sensitive adhesive which may be used is advantageously a clear distortion free adhesive such as a functional polyester based adhesive having siloxane functionality which provides a strong bond to glass.<br>
An example of a pressure sensitive adhesive includes an acrylic solvent based pressure sensitive adhesive which is applied at about 10 lb./ream coat weight.   The<br><br>
pressure sensitive adhesive of layer 27 may include 4% by weight of a UV absorber such as a benzotriazole UV absorber. Such a pressure sensitive adhesive is commercially available as National Starch 80-1057. Other adhesives or adhesive types may be substituted for the PSA adhesive as can other types of UV absorbers. It should be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the an that these UV absorbers function as stabilizers, and may be added to the present invention to protect the adhesive from deterioration (e.g., deterioration caused by sunlight). These stabilizers, however, are not required to practice the invention.<br>
The adhesive layer such as layer 27 may be omitted if the combination of filters is in the form of a flexible bag or a tent.<br>
Layer 28 used in the various embodiments of this invention is a weatherable PET UV screening film which is preferably a PET film with UV absorbers dyed into it at at least 2.4 optical density (OD) absorbance. A suitable PET film for layer 28 includes the film manufactured by the dyeing process described in U.S. Patent No. 6,221,112. Other films with similar UV screening capability may be substituted for the above-described film used in layer 28.<br>
The thickness of the PET film used to make layer 28 may be varied. For example, the film used in layer 28 in Figures 6 and 7 is desirably 1 mil thick to provide sufficient support for other layers used in the overall structure. The thickness of layer 28 in Figure 8 may be 0.5 mil thick.<br>
The low resistance sputtered stack of layer 29 used in the various embodiments of this invention may be either the Ag/Ti or the Ag/Au stack as described herein or a similar configuration on a PET clear substrate. The low resistance stack provides higher visible light transmission.<br><br>
The laminating adhesive layer 30 used in the various embodiments of the invention may be any conventional laminating adhesive including pressure sensitive adhesives known to those skilled in the an of the technological area of this invention. A useful laminating adhesive includes any conventional polyester adhesive with an isocyanate cross-linker added thereto. An example of such a laminating adhesive is Rohm and Haas1 Adcote 76R36 adhesive with catalyst 9H1H. The adhesive may be applied at 1-1.5 lb. per ream coat weight. Other laminating adhesives may be substituted for the above-noted polyester-type adhesive.<br>
Layer 31 used in the various embodiments of this invention is a clear plastic film such as clear PET which is optionally provided with a UV screening capability as described above with respect to layer 28. Thus, the clear PET layer 31 is preferably a clear PET film which optionally has UV absorbers dyed into it at at least 2.4 OD absorbance. The thickness of the PET film used in layer 31 may be varied. For example, the PET film used in layer 31 of Figures 6 and 8 may be 0.5 mil thick. The PET of layer 31 in Figure 7 may be 0.5 or 1 mil thick. Also, layer 31 in Figure 8 is clear PET film without UV absorbers dyed into it. The PET of layer 31 in Figures 6 and 7 may be either the clear PET without the UV absorbers dyed into it or may be the clear PET with UV absorbers dyed into it at at least 2.4 OD absorbance. The "2.4 absorbance" referred to herein is measured at 358 nm wavelength.<br>
The hardcoat layer 32 used in the various embodiments of this invention may be formed from any of the hardcoat materials described herein or from any other conventional hardcoat material. Layer 32 used in the various embodiments of this invention is preferably 1-2 microns thick. The hardcoat is used to protect the combination of filters from damage and therefore the hardcoat may be omitted when the combination of filters is in a protected area where damage is not likely to occur. A suitable hardcoat composition includes the hardcoat described in U.S. patent no. 4,557,980; the specification of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br><br>
Layer 33 used in the various embodiments of this invention is the aforementioned IR absorbing layer which preferably comprises LaBa and antimony tin oxide as a coating or film.<br>
Layer 36 used in the various embodiments of this invention may be a 1 mil PET film or a functionally equivalent plastic film with a sputtered heat reflecting-conductive metal stack coating made up of a copper layer interposed between two nickel/chrome alloy layers. Layer 36 has a visible light transmission of about 35 %. The nickel/chrome alloy layers are preferably Hastelloy C276 or Inconel 600. Layer 36 which includes the film with the metal stack deposited thereon, preferably has a sheet resistance which is less than 8 ohms per square.<br>
Layer 37 used in the various embodiments of this invention is a heat reflecting film which preferably includes the above-described sputtered metal/oxide stack (described in U.S. Patent No. 6,007,901) on a 1 mil clear weatherable polyester (PET) film. The polyester film has UV absorbers dyed into it at at least 2.4 OD UV absorbance (2.4 OD UV absorbing PET). The film may be dyed using the dyeing process described in U.S. patent no. 6,221,112. Other films with similar UV screening capability may be used in place of the aforementioned UV screening film.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, two spaced apart filter combinations are utilized in combination with a window glazing unit to provide enhanced security. For example, a film comprising a combination of filters may be adhered to each side of a glazing unit (e.g., glass or plastic glazing) or one film comprising a combination of filters may be adhered to each of two spaced apart transparent sheets of a glazing unit. Alternatively, two spaced apart films each of which comprises a combination of filters may be spaced apart within the space located between two spaced apart transparent sheets of a glazing unit.<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment of the spaced apart filter combinations, each of the filter combinations are embedded (preferably completely embedded) within a PVB interlayer of a glazing unit which includes at least one PVB layer interposed between two transparent sheets of glazing material (e.g., glass or plastic). More preferably one filter combination is embedded in a first PVB interlayer and another filter combination is embedded in a second PVB interlayer spaced apart from the first PVB interlayer. An example of this more preferred embodiment is illustrated in figures 12 and 13.<br>
The embodiment depicted in figure 12 includes front and rear surfaces 49 and 50, glass layers 41, 42 and 43 with PVB interlayer 44 interposed between glass layers 41 and 42 and PVB interlayer 45 interposed between glass layers 42 and 43. The PVB layers 44 and 45 fill the gap between the glass sheets and include films 47 and 48 embedded therein. Films 47 and 48 comprise any of the above-described filter combinations as a component thereof. Preferably each edge 46 of films 47 and 48 lie within the PVB so that the edges are not exposed to water, oxygen or other corrosive or harmful environmental conditions. The edges, being embedded within the PVB interlayer, thereby produce a "picture frame" configuration as shown in figure 13 wherein the edge 46 of film 47 (and likewise edge 46 of film 48) is spaced apart from the edge 51 of the entire structure.<br>
The PVB layers are conventionally used in window manufacturing and serve to adhere the glass sheets to form a laminate which functions as a safety glass. The PVB layers used in this invention may be substituted with other similar plastic laminating layers such as polyurethane. The preferred glass layers may be substituted with other window glazing materials such as polycarbonate and polyacrylics. Thus the embodiment depicted in figure 12 may use alternating layers of glass, polycarbonate and polyacrylic instead of the three glass layers.<br>
Another embodiment of the invention which utilizes two spaced apart filter combinations is illustrated in figure 15.  The embodiment shown in figure 15 is glazing<br><br>
for a window and includes therein two spaced apart films 47 and 48 which comprise any of the filter combinations described herein. Layer 54 adhesively secures film 47 to film 48. Layer 54 may be a conventional safety glass interlayer such as PVB or the like. Alternatively layer 54 may be an adhesive layer. An adhesive layer is advantageously used in place of the PVB for layer 54 in situations where the spacing between films 47 and 48 is smaller than the smallest spacing which would be permitted when PVB is used to adhesively secure films 47 and 48. This is because PVB generally requires a relatively thick application to form layer 54 whereas adhesives can be applied in thin layers to produce a narrow spacing between films 47 and 48 and the thickness of the adhesive can be adjusted to regulate the spacing.<br>
The PVB or adhesive of interlayer 54 may be electrically conductive. Electrical conductivity may be achieved by any known technique such as by the incorporation of electrically conductive particles therein.<br>
The embodiment shown in figure 15 also includes conventional interlayers 55 and<br>
56 made of PVB or the like and elass sheets 57 and 58 on the outer surfaces thereof.<br>
&gt;~-<br>
Figure 14 depicts an embodiment of the invention which includes a glass substrate connected to any of the filter combinations of the invention with a glass fragmentation safety film adhered thereto. In figure 14 reference numeral 52 represents the combination of a glass substrate connected to any of the filter combinations of the invention and reference numeral 53 represents a flexible plastic film such as PET film adhesively secured to the combination 52.<br>
The embodiments described herein include instances where the filters or combination of filters are applied onto a film such as a plastic film which in turn is adhered to window glazing. However it is within the scope of this invention to omit the film or films used for any filter or combination of filters and apply the filter or combination of filters onto or within a component of window glazing.<br><br><br><br>
