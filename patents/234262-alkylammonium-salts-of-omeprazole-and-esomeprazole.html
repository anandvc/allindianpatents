				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to novel salts of 5-methoxy-2-[[(4-methoxy-3,5-dimethyl-2-pyridinyl)-methyl]sulfinyl]-lH-benzimidazole or salts of the single enantiomers thereof in a pure and isolated form. Specifically, it relates to alkylammonium salts of the compounds, more specifically primary alkylammonium salts of the compounds. The present invention also relates to processes for preparing certain alkylammonium salts of omeprazole and esomeprazoie in a pure and isolated fonn and pharmaceutical compositions containing them.<br>
Background of the invention and prior art<br>
The compound 5-methoxy-2-[[(4-methoxy~3.5-dimethyI-2-pyridinyl)methyl]sulfinyl]-1H-benzimidazole, having the generic name omeprazole, and therapeutically acceptable salts thereof, are described in EP 0 005 120.<br>
Omeprazole is a sulfoxide and a chiral compound, wherein the sulphur atom being the stereogenic center. Thus, omeprazole is aracemic mixture of its two single cnantiomers, the R- and S-enantiomer of omeprazole, herein referred to as R-omeprazxole and S-omeprazole, the latter have the generic name esomeprazoie. The absolute configuration of the enantiomers of omeprazole has been determined by an X-ray study of an N-alkylated derivate of the R-enantiomer.<br>
Omeprazole and esomeprazoie are proton pump inhibitors, and are useful as antiulcer agents, in a more general sense, omeprazole and esomeprazoie may be used for prevention and treatment of gastric add related diseases in mammals  and especially in man.<br><br>
Specific alkaline salts of omeprazole are disclosed in EP 0 124 495. Herein, quaternary ammonium salts and guanidine salts of orneprazole are disclosed. Document WO 97/41114 discloses processes for preparing magnesium salt of benzimidazoles, including magnesium salt of orneprazole. However, no salts of orneprazole prepared from primary amines are mentioned in these documents.<br>
Certain salts of the single enantiomers of orneprazole and their preparation are disclosed in WO 94/27988, for instance, quaternary ammonium salts of esomeprazole are mentioned. However, no salts employing primary, secondary or tertiary amines are disclosed or suggested. The described salts of esomeprazole have improved pharmacokinetic and metabolic properties, which will give an improved therapeutic profile such as a lower degree of interindividual variation. WO 96/02535 and WO 98/54171 disclose preferred processes for preparing esomeprazole and salts thereof.<br>
In the formulation of drug compositions, it is important for the active pharmaceutical ingredient to be in a form in which it can be conveniently handled and processed. This is of importance, not only from the point of view of obtaining a commercially viable manufacturing process, but also from the point of view of subsequent manufacture of pharmaceutical formulations (e.g. oral dosage forms such as tablets) comprising the active pharmaceutical ingredient.<br>
Further, in the manufacture of oral pharmaceutical compositions, it is important that a reliable, reproducible and constant plasma concentration profile of the active pharmaceutical ingredient is provided following administration to a patient.<br>
Chemical stability, solid state stability, and "shelf life" of the active pharmaceutical ingredient are important properties for a pharmaceutical active compound. The active pharmaceutical ingredient, and compositions containing it, should be capable of being effectively stored over appreciable periods of time, without exhibiting a significant change in the physico-chemical characteristics of the active pharmaceutical ingredient, e.g. its<br>
chemical composition, density, hygroscopicity and solubility. Thus, in the manufacture of commercially viable and pharmaceutically acceptable drug compositions, it is important, wherever possible, to provide the active pharmaceutical ingredient in a substantially crystalline and stable form.<br>

X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) analysis was performed on samples of tert-butylammonium salt of omeprazole and on samples of tert-butylammoniumsalt of esomeprazole, according to standard methods, for example, those described in Giacovazzo,. C. et al. (1995), Fundamentals of Crystallography, Oxford University Press; Jenkins, R. and Snyder, R. L. (1996), Introduction to X-Ray Powder Diffractometry, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York; Bunn, C. W. (1948), Chemical Crystallography, Clarendon Press, London; or Klug, H. P. &amp; Alexander, L. E. (1974), X-ray Diffraction Procedures, John Wiley and Sons, New York. X-ray analyses were performed using a Siemens D5000 diffractometer.<br>
The compounds of the invention are characterized by the positions and intensities of the peaks in the X-ray powder diffractogram, as well as by the unit cell parameters. Furthermore, the compounds of the invention could be characterized by H1 -NMR, IR, FTIR and Raman spectroscopy.<br>
In a further aspect, the present invention provides processes for the preparation of alkylammoniumsalts of omeprazole and of esomeprazole. Suitable processes for the salt formation are temperature induced crystallisation, fast crystallisation at elevated    temperature, slow crystallisation at room temperature, thermal recrystallisation, and crystallisation by evaporation.<br>
In a further aspect, the present invention provides processes for the preparation of alkylammonium salts of omeprazole and of esomeprazole, which comprises the following steps: omeprazole or esomeprazole is either dissolved or formed in situ in a suitable solvent, such as acetonitril or tert-butyl methyl ether. The alkylamine is added during<br>
stirring. A precipitate of the salt compound is formed and the precipitate is separated by filtration. The obtained compound is washed with a solvent and the obtained crystals are dried.<br>
A further aspect of the invention is that a crystallisation of the product provides that the salt can be quickly and easily filtered off and dried, and thus decreasing the time of processing: The addition of an alkylamine can easily and conveniently be performed on a large scale since alkylamines preferred for performing the present invention are liquids having low viscosity. Furthermore, during the process, any excess of the alkylamine is easily removed by drying since use of alkylamines having low boiling point is preferred. Therefore, the alkylamine used in the reaction can be added in excess, which is of considerable advantage in full-scale production.<br>
Still a further aspect of the invention is that the novel compounds may be of interest as intermediates in the synthesis of other compounds such as magnesium salts of omeprazole<br>
and of esomeprazole, which are the pharmaceutically active components in products with<br>
the tradenames LosecÂ®    MUPSÂ®    and NexiumÂ®  . During the synthesis of the active<br><br>
component for NexiumÂ®   i.e. the magnesium salt of esomeprazole, a titanium catalyst may<br>
be used in the oxidation step prior to the salt formation steps. The synthesis usually proceeds with the formation of monovalent salt of esomeprazole by adding a monovalent hydroxide or alkoxide. This monovalent salt of esomeprazole, such as sodium or potassium salts, is thereafter converted to the magnesium salt. Insoluble inorganic titanium salts, such as titanium oxid, are being formed when strong bases such as sodium or potassium alkoxides are being added to a solution of titanium catalysts. Using an alkylamine as a salt forming agent rather than using a sodium- or potassium-containing base avoids the risk of inorganic titanium salts being co-precipitated with the desired salt. Even, if the titanium-catalyst may react with the alkylamine, a soluble complex of the alkylamine and titanium may be formed, which may stay in the solution while filtering off the desired alkylammonium salt of the benzimidazole compound.<br>
As synthetic intermediate salts, alkylammonium salts of omeprazole and esomeprazole obtainable from easily removable amines are desired. In previous known processes for producing salts of esomeprazole (described in WO 96/02535 and WO 98/54171) an exchange of the metal ion is performed. For example, in the process for producing magnesium salt of esomeprazole, an intermediate salt consisting of the potassium salt of esomeprazole is formed which may result in residues of potassium ions as impurity ions in the desired, magnesium salt of esomeprazole.<br>
By preparing and using the alkylammoniumsalts as intermediate salts, undesired<br>
components are avoided in the final product, i.e. the magnesium salt, as alkylamine is<br>
being released during the addition of a magnesium source. Liberated alkylamine can then<br>
be removed either by drying the magnesium salt in vacuum or by washing the magnesium<br>
salt.	<br>
The compounds of the invention are surprisingly easily soluble in water. This property is of great advantage, for instance when an i.v.-formulation should be prepared. Solutions containing the dissolved and ionised alkylammonium salt of omeprazole or alkylammonium salt of esomeprazole have a lower pH than corresponding solutions made from the previously known alkali-salts of omeprazole and of esomeprazole. A less basic solution is advantageous for i.v. administration.<br>
The examplified iert-butylammonium salts of omeprazole and esomeprazole, respectively, are in crystalline forms. They exhibit advantageous properties, such as convenient handling as well as chemical and solid-state stability. The products obtained according to the present invention are well-defined crystalline products. Such crystalline products give an easily processability during the manufacture of suitable dosage forms. A crystalline product is easy to handle during milling, filtering and tableting. The procedures have high reproducibility. Also, the stability is improved when a well-defined crystalline form of the compound is obtained. These properties are of great value considering dosage forms such as e.g. tablets.<br>
The compounds of the invention are effective as a gastric acid secretion inhibitor, and are useful as an antiulcer agent. In a more general sense, they can be used for prevention and treatment of gastric-acid related conditions in mammals and especially in man, including e.g. reflux esophagitis, gastritis, duodenitis, gastric ulcer and duodenal ulcer. Furthermore, they may be used for treatment of other gastrointestinal disorders where gastric acid inhibitory effect is desirable e.g. in patients on NSAID therapy, in patients with Non Ulcer Dyspepsia, in patients with symptomatic gastro-esophageal reflux disease, and in patients with gastrinomas. The compounds of the invention may also be used in patients in intensive care situations, in patients with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding, pre- and postoperatively to prevent aspiration of gastric acid, to prevent and treat stress ulceration and asthma, and for improvement of sleep. Further, the compounds of the invention may be useful in the treatment of psoriasis as well as in the treatment of Helicobacter infections and diseases related to these. The compounds of the invention may also be used for treatment of inflammatory conditions in mammals, including man.<br>
For the avoidance of doubt, by "treatment" is meant to include the therapeutic treatment as well as the prophylaxis, of a condition.<br>
Any suitable route of administration may be employed for providing the patient with an effective dosage of the alkyl ammonium salt of omeprazole or esomeprazole, according to the invention. For example, peroral or parenteral formulations and the like may be employed. Dosage forms include capsules, tablets, dispersions, suspensions and the like.<br>
It is further provided a pharmaceutical composition comprising the compounds according to the invention, as active ingredient, in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent or excipient and optionally other therapeutic ingredients. Compositions comprising other therapeutic ingredients are especially of interest in the treatment of Helicobacter infections. The invention also provides the use of the compounds in the manufacture of a medicament for use in the treatment of a gastric-acid related condition<br>
and a method of treating a gastric-acid related condition which method comprises administering to a subject suffering from said condition a therapeutically effective amount of the compounds according to the invention.<br>
The composition of the invention includes compositions suitable for peroral or parenteral administration. The most preferred route is the oral route. The compositions may be conveniently presented in unit dosage forms, and prepared by any methods known in the art of pharmacy.<br>
In the practice of the invention, the most suitable route of administration as well as the magnitude of a therapeutic dose of the compounds according to the invention in any case will depend on the nature and severity of the disease to be treated. The dose, and dose frequency, may also vary according to the age, body weight and response of the individual patient. Special requirements may be needed for patients having Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, such as a need for higher doses than the average patient. Children and patients with liver diseases generally will benefit from doses that are somewhat lower than average. Thus, in some conditions it may be necessary to use doses outside the ranges stated below, for example long-term treatments may request lower dosage. Such higher and lower doses are within the scope of the present invention. Such daily doses may vary between 5 mg to 300 mg.<br>
In general, a suitable oral dosage form of the compound of the invention may cover a dose range from 5 mg to 300 mg total daily dose, administered in one single dose or equally divided doses. A preferred dosage range is from 10 mg to 80 mg.<br>
The compound of the invention may be combined as the active component in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional techniques, such as the oral formulations described in WO 96/01623 and EP 0 247 983, the disclosures of which are hereby as a whole included by reference.<br>
Combination preparations comprising the compounds of the invention and other active ingredients may also be used..Examples of such active ingredients include, but are not limited to anti-bacterial compounds, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, antacid agents, alginates and prokinetic agents.<br>
The examples below will further illustrate the preparation of the compound of the invention, according to different process routes and including new intermediates. These examples are not intended to limit the scope if the invention as defined hereinabove or as claimed below..<br>
