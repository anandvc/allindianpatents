				<td>Priority is hereby claimed to the Chinese Patent Application No. 200710006885.6 filed<br>
February 2, 2007 and the Chinese Patent Application No. 200710105889.X filed June 1,2007,<br>
which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to GSM network interface technology, particularly to a<br>
method, a device and a system for establishing a bearer for a GSM network.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
In a conventional Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) network system,<br>
the Base Station Controller (BSC) side is required to convert the wireless side voice from<br>
compressed codes (such as HR/FR/EFR codes) to non-compressed G.711 codes. The Media<br>
Gateway (MGW) on the core network side is required to convert the non-compressed G.711<br>
codes to Adaptive Multi-Rate (AMR) compressed codes. Furthermore, the MGW is required<br>
to convert the bearer mode between TDM bearer on one side and IP bearer on the other side.<br>
In order to realize these conversions, a Trans coder and Rate Adaption Unit (TRAU) or a<br>
Trans Coder (TC) is typically inserted in the BSC of the GSM network system, and a TC is<br>
inserted in the MGW, for corresponding conversions of voice codes and bearer modes. Such<br>
conversions may lower voice quality, waste a lot of costly TC resources, and increase<br>
equipment costs. At the same time, since G.711 coding is used in the A interface, each path<br>
of the calls occupies a bandwidth of 64k, causing a waste of long-distance transmission<br>
resources from the BSC to the MGW.<br>
To save the TDM transmission resource between the BSC and the MGW, an<br>
improved method presently proposed is to move the TRAU from the BSC side to the MGW<br>
side to collocate the TRAU with the MGW, and an Ater interface is provided between the<br>
BSC and the TRAU for transmitting voice and data in format of TRAU frames. Since each<br>
call of the Ater interface occupies a bandwidth of only 16k, four calls may be multiplexed<br>
into one TDM slot, saving the valuable long-distance transmission resource between the BSC<br>
and the MGW.<br>
Although the improved method mentioned above solves the problem of wasting the<br>
long-distance transmission resource between the BSC and the MGW, TCs are still required to<br>
 <br>
be inserted in both the TRAU and the MGW for the conversion of bearer modes, which also<br>
suffers voice quality deterioration and TC resource wasting due to multiple code conversions.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
An embodiment of the present invention provides a method for establishing a bearer<br>
for a GSM network to improve voice quality.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention provides a base station control device to<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
In order to make the objects, technical solutions and advantages of the present<br>
invention clearer, a detailed description of the present invention is provided below with<br>
reference to the figures and embodiments.<br>
The GSM system defined by the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)<br>
standardization organization mainly consists of three parts: a Mobile Switching Subsystem<br>
(MSS), a Base Station Subsystem (BSS) and a Mobile Station (MS). Fig. 1 is a diagram<br>
illustrating the GSM network architecture in the application scenario of a method<br>
embodiment of the present invention. As shown in Fig. 1, the system includes an MSS, a BSS<br>
and an MS. The MSS implements the main switching functions of GSM, and at the same time<br>
manages subscriber data and a database required for mobility. The MSS also manages<br>
communications between GSM mobile subscribers and communications between a GSM<br>
mobile subscriber and a subscriber of another communication network. The MSS includes a<br>
Mobile Switching Center (MSC) server and an MGW. The BSS includes a BSC and a Base<br>
Transceiver Station (BTS). The BSC interfaces with the wireless network and is responsible<br>
for the management of the wireless network and wireless resources. The BSC is also<br>
responsible for managing the establishment, the connection and the releasing of calling/called<br>
MSs and BTS wireless connections on the calling/called side, providing functions such as<br>
voice coding, code type conversion and rate adaptation. The BTS performs conversion<br>
between the BSC and the wireless channel, and performs wireless transmission over the air<br>
interface between the BTS and MSs and realizes related control functions.<br>
 <br>
The interface between the BTS and the BSC is an Abis interface that transmits GSM<br>
voice and data messages with Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) codes and Channel Codec<br>
Unit (CCU) protocol frames. Each CCU channel occupies a bandwidth of 16k. Voice coding<br>
formats include Half Rate (HR), Full Rate (FR) and Enhanced Full Rate (EFR) coding. The<br>
interface between the BSS and the MSC server is an A interface. On the side of the MGW<br>
where the MGW is connected with the BSC, the A interface between the BSC and the MGW<br>
is an MGW wireless side end point that transmits voice and data with TDM G.711 protocol.<br>
The coding method is G.711 and each call occupies a bandwidth of 64 kbps.<br>
On the MSS side, the MSC server and the MGW use a mode of 3GPP R4 in which the<br>
bearer and the control are separated. All signaling controls are processed by the MSC server,<br>
and all bearers are processed by the MGW. An Nb interface is used between the MGW and<br>
another MGW. The coding method is typically AMR coding. An Internet Protocol (IP)<br>
transmission mode is used to increase transmission efficiency and save bandwidth. An Nc<br>
interface is used between the MSC server and the MGW. An A interface is used between the<br>
MSC server and the BSC for the bearing of messages such as messages about user's<br>
connection requests and messages about disconnection commands by transmitting the Base<br>
Station Subsystem Application Part (BSSAP) signaling. After being processed by the BSC,<br>
the messages are sent to the BTS. The BSSAP messages are defined by the GSM08.08<br>
specification. An Nc interface is used between the MSC server and another MSC server to<br>
solve the problem of separate call controls and bearer controls using the Bearer Independent<br>
Call Control (BICC) protocol. The bearing of call control signaling on various networks is<br>
proposed for applications of telephone services, which may provide good transparency for<br>
implementing services of existing circuit-switched telephone networks in NGN.<br>
Fig. 2 is a diagram illustrating the improved GSM network structure on the<br>
calling/called side in the application scenario of the method embodiment of the present<br>
invention. As shown in Fig. 2, an Ater interface is used between the BSC and the TRAU to<br>
transmit voice and data in format of TRAU frames. The original interfaces and bearer modes<br>
between the TRAU and the MGW remain unchanged. Since each call at the Ater interface<br>
occupies only a bandwidth of 16k, four calls may be multiplexed into one TDM slot, hence<br>
saving the valuable long-distance transmission resources between the BSC and the MGW.<br>
Embodiments of the present invention may effectively mitigate the wasting of TC<br>
resources and achieve full path or half path TrFO for the telephone channel by realizing the<br>
 <br>
IP-based A interface between the BSC and the MGW and directly transmitting wireless side<br>
compressed voice codes such as HR/FR/EFR codes.<br>
The present invention proposes a system for establishing a bearer for a GSM network.<br>
Changing interfaces of the GSM network into IP-based interfaces includes establishing an IP<br>
bearer and implementing code type negotiation. Media services and signaling are transmitted<br>
through the IP bearer, and the problem of voice quality deterioration due to the transcoding<br>
TC is solved.<br>
Fig. 3 is a diagram illustrating the system structure of the GSM network with IP-based<br>
interfaces according to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to Fig.3, the<br>
system includes an MS, a BTS, a BSC, an MSC server and an MGW.<br>
The MS is configured to transmit a call request message carrying information about<br>
the code types it supports to the BSC and receive a message returned by the MSC server<br>
indicating that the call is being processed.<br>
The BTS is configured to transparently transmit the call request message sent by the<br>
MS and the message sent by the MSC server indicating that the call is being processed.<br>
The BSC is configured to establish an IP bearer with the MGW and implement code<br>
type conversion, receive the call request message transmitted by the MS, transparently<br>
transmit it to the MSC server, receive and forward the message transmitted by the MSC<br>
server indicating that the call is being processed; and receive an assignment message<br>
transmitted by the MSC server. If the interface between the BSC and the MGW is determined<br>
to be an A interface, the IP address and the port number of the wireless side of the MGW is<br>
obtained and the IP address and the port number of its own are assigned for the call, and an IP<br>
bearer is established.<br>
If the interface between the BSC and the MGW is determined to be an Ater interface,<br>
the establishment of the Ater interface channel between the BSC and the MGW is negotiated<br>
using in-band signaling of the bearer plane through TRAU signaling (the in-band signaling<br>
between the BSC and the MGW may be established in advance). The IP address and the port<br>
number assigned for the call by the MGW are acquired and the IP address and the port<br>
number of its own are assigned for the call. The MGW acquires the IP address and the port<br>
number assigned for the call by the BSC via the Ater interface channel and an IP bearer is<br>
established. Alternatively, the Ater interface between the BSC and the MGW is simulated as<br>
an A interface, and the BSC receives the assignment message, acquires the IP address and the<br>
 <br>
port number of the wireless side of the MGW and assigns the IP address and the port number<br>
of its own of the Ater interface side for the call, and an IP bearer is established.<br>
An assignment message transmitted by the MSC server is received. A code type is<br>
selected according to priority list of the code type or its own policy, and the code type<br>
selected by the BSC is fed back to the MSC server through an assignment response message.<br>
If the selected code type is consistent with the code type with the highest priority in the<br>
priority list of the code type, the TrFO in this segment is realized and the transparent<br>
transmission of media stream is accomplished; otherwise, a message for changing the code<br>
type is received from the MSC server and code type conversion between the code type<br>
selected by the BSC and the code type required by the MSC server is performed.<br>
The MSC server separates the bearer and the control, and is configured to: process the<br>
signaling control part, transmit IP bearer information such as the IP address and the port<br>
number by extended BSSAP signaling, receive the call request message transmitted by the<br>
MS, extract information about the code type in the call request message, find the intersection<br>
with the code types it supports, and establish the priority list of the code type; transmit a<br>
message to the MS indicating that the call is being processed, transmit a message to the<br>
MGW for adding a wireless side end point, and receive the response message returned by the<br>
MGW; transmit or receive a message carrying the priority list of the code type information to<br>
or from other MSC servers, and accomplish code type negotiation for realizing TrFO;<br>
transmit an assignment message to the BSC, and receive an assignment response message<br>
containing information about the selected code type transmitted from the BSC; perform code<br>
type negotiation and transmit a bearer and code type modify message to the MGW, where the<br>
bearer and code type modify message carries the IP address and the port number information<br>
assigned for the call by the BSC; and distribute the message for changing the code type to the<br>
BSC or the MGW as necessary, if the code type conversion function is realized at the BSC.<br>
The MGW is configured to: establish an IP bearer with the BSC and perform code<br>
type conversion, receive a message for adding a wireless side end point transmitted by the<br>
MSC server, transmit the response message containing the IP address and the port number<br>
assigned for the call to the MSC server, receive the bearer and code type modify message<br>
transmitted by the MSC server, acquire the IP address and the port number assigned for the<br>
call by the BSC, and establish an IP bearer; modifies the code type for the corresponding end<br>
point as instructed by the message.<br>
 <br>
In the system shown in Fig.3, the MGW(s) may be a same MSW or may be different<br>
MGWs. When the MGWs are different MGWs, the process of establishing the IP bearer<br>
connection for the A interface between the BSC on the other side and the MGW is similar to<br>
that of the system shown in Fig. 3, and the description of the process will not be repeated.<br>
Also, the MSC server(s) may be a same MSC server or may be different MSC servers.<br>
When the MSC servers are different MSC servers, an Nc interface is used between the MSC<br>
servers and an Nb interface is used between the MGWs. The MSC server at the calling side<br>
transmits initialization (IAM) information to the MSC server at the called side, and the MSC<br>
server at the called side returns IP bearer information to establish an IP bearer between the<br>
Nb interface side of the MGW at the calling side and the Nb interface side of the MGW at the<br>
called side. The BICC and the IP Bearer Control Protocol (IPBCP) may be referred to for<br>
details. The process of establishing the IP bearer connection between the wireless side of the<br>
MGW and the BSC on both the calling side and the called side is similar to the process of<br>
establishing the IP bearer connection between the wireless side of the MGW and the BSC on<br>
either the calling side or the called side, in which code type negotiation is required for the<br>
establishment of TrFO and the establishment of the IP bearer. The difference is that: if both<br>
sides are IP bearers, a full path TrFO negotiation for voice channel is required to be<br>
performed; but if only one side is an IP bearer, only a voice channel with half path TrFO may<br>
be established.<br>
In Fig. 3, the assignment response message should include information such as<br>
information about the code type selected by the BSC, the IP address and the port number<br>
assigned for the call by the BSC.<br>
In practical applications, alternatively, code type negotiation and modifying may be<br>
performed after the establishment of the IP bearer by the BSC with the MGW. The specific<br>
process is described as follows.<br>
First, base station control devices such as the BSC remove the TRAU encapsulation<br>
(i.e., the processing of TRAU termination) of the received wireless side data to obtain<br>
payload data after voice compression coding. After that, the payload data after voice<br>
compression coding is encapsulated in IP packets, passed to the MGW via the A interface<br>
between the BSC and the MGW. The MGW continues to perform service transmission<br>
processing.<br>
In the implementation of the process of removing TRAU encapsulation described<br>
above, the voice compression coding method of the current frame may be obtained according<br>
 <br>
to a certain bit in it. After that, the data is subject to corresponding processing according to<br>
the acquired coding method. For example, for the FR coding method, an FR voice of 20 ms<br>
has exactly 260 bits and Dl through D260 are the final voice compression coded payload<br>
data. For the EFR coding method, the non-EFR coded voice data for Cyclic Redundancy<br>
Check (CRC) in the 260 bits need to be removed to obtain the final 244 bits of data<br>
corresponding to the EFR voice of 20 ms, and so on.<br>
In practical applications, after the MGW receives the voice compression coded<br>
payload data (i.e., payload data after compressed coding) transmitted via IP packets by the<br>
BSC, at least one of the following two treatments may further be carried out:<br>
(1)	determining whether the compression coding method used for the voice<br>
compression coded payload data is the same as the compression coding method used on the<br>
receiving end side of the data (the Nb interface or the A interface on the other side); and<br>
(2)	determining whether the encapsulation method used for the voice compression<br>
coded payload data is the same as the encapsulation method used on the receiving end side of<br>
the data.<br>
In the determinations described above, if the determination result is positive, the data<br>
is directly passed to the receiving end of the data. Otherwise, at least one of the compression<br>
coding method and the encapsulation method of the data that is determined to be different is<br>
converted into the compression coding method and/or the encapsulation method used on the<br>
receiving end side and then transmitted to the receiving end.<br>
In order for the MGW to be able to identify and determine the compression coding<br>
method used for the voice compression coded payload data, the corresponding processing<br>
may be as follows. First, the BSC transmits the compression coding method used for the<br>
received voice compression coded payload data to the MSC server. After that, the MSC<br>
server transmits the compression coding method used for the data to the MGW, so that the<br>
MGW knows the corresponding compression coding method.<br>
Furthermore, in order for the MGW and BSC to learn the bearer information of the<br>
received data, the bearer information used for the transmitted data may also be transmitted to<br>
the MSC server by the BSC, and transmitted by the MSC server to the MGW. The bearer<br>
information used for the transmitted data may alternatively be transmitted to the MSC server<br>
by the MGW, and transmitted by the MSC server to the BSC.<br>
The service transmission processes provided in embodiments of the present invention<br>
includes a service transmission process in the Second Generation Mobile Communication<br>
 <br>
System and a service transmission process between the Second and the Third Generation<br>
Mobile Communication Systems, which will be described respectively in the following.<br>
In the Second Generation Mobile Communication System, for single rate coding,<br>
service transmission between the MGW on the calling user side and the MGW on the called<br>
user side is not realized with a user plane encapsulation method. In other words, the user<br>
plane encapsulation operation is not conducted at the MGW.<br>
In the Second Mobile Communication System and the Third Generation Mobile<br>
Communication System, if a single rate coding is used between the MGW at the calling user<br>
side and the MGW at called user side, service transmission between the two MGWs is not<br>
realized with the user plane encapsulation method. In other words, the user plane<br>
encapsulation operation is not conducted at the MGW. If a multiple rate coding is used, the<br>
service transmission is realized with the user plane encapsulation method. In other words,<br>
corresponding user plane encapsulation operation needs to be carried out at the MGW.<br>
In the processing described above, a Real-time Transmission Protocol (RTP)<br>
encapsulation method is used for the service transmission between the BSC and the MGW.<br>
An example is as follows, in which the Abis interface between the BTS and the BSC<br>
is a TDM bearer. At the BSC, only the conversion from TDM bearer to IP bearer and the<br>
termination of TRAU, i.e., the processing of removing TRAU encapsulation, are performed,<br>
without transcoding. In other words, transmitted between the BSC and the MGW are the<br>
GSM compression coded data. The corresponding compression coding method may be HR<br>
coding, FR coding, EFR coding or AMR (adaptive rate) coding. In the BSC, the GSM<br>
compressed coded voice payload is encapsulated as RTP messages and transmitted to the<br>
MGW. No codec conversion TC needs to be remained any longer in the BSC.<br>
Fig. 4 is a diagram illustrating the architecture of the BSC according to an<br>

an IP bearer, and transmit an assignment response message containing the IP address and the<br>
port number assigned for the call by the equipment to a transmitting unit; and<br>
 <br>
a transmitting unit, configured to receive and transmitting the assignment response<br>
message.<br>
After receiving the assignment message, the processing unit may further select a code<br>
type according to the priority order in a priority list of the code type or a preset policy and<br>
transmit the selected code type in the assignment response message to the MSC server via the<br>
transmitting unit.<br>
In practical applications, the BSC may also be configured to remove the TRAU<br>
encapsulation of the received wireless side data to obtain the voice compression coded<br>
payload data and encapsulate the voice compression coded payload data in IP packets. It may<br>
also be configured to transmit information about the compression coding method used for<br>
transmitting data in user plane and/or bearer information to the MSC server and the MSC<br>
server transmits information about the compression coding method and/or the bearer<br>
information of the data to the MGW. At the same time, it may also receive information about<br>
the compression coding method and/or the bearer information transmitted by the MGW via<br>
the MSC server.<br>

information used for the data passed by the MGW from the MGW via the MSC server.<br>
 <br>

In practical applications, the Transcoder and Rate Adoption Unit, the terminating unit<br>
and the data encapsulating unit may also be included in the processing unit as sub-units of the<br>
processing unit.<br>
In practical applications, the processing unit may further include a code converting<br>
module for converting code types according to the code change message distributed by the<br>
Mobile Switching Center Server.<br>

bearer and code type modify message, acquire the IP address and the port number assigned<br>
for the call by the BSC, and establish the IP bearer with the BSC; and<br>

encapsulations removed after acquiring IP packets via the A interface between the base<br>
station control device and the Media Gateway. It may further communicate with the MSC<br>
server to acquire the compression coding method information from the MSC server which is<br>
received from the BSC and learn the corresponding compression coding method. And, it<br>
transmits the bearer information used for the locally transmitted data to the MSC server to<br>
transmit the bearer information to the BSC via the MSC server. That is, it reports the bearer<br>
information assigned for the call by the MGW at the wireless side end point to the MSC<br>
server, and the bearer information is then distributed to the BSC to allow each of the MGW<br>
and the BSC to establish a bearer between them after acquiring the bearer information from<br>
each other.<br>

determining whether the compression coding method and/or encapsulation method used for<br>
the data in the IP packets are the same as the compression coding method and/or<br>
encapsulation method used on the receiving end side of the data. If the compression coding<br>
methods and/or encapsulation methods are the same, the IP packets are directly transmitted to<br>
the data transmitting unit. Otherwise, the IP packets are transmitted to the conversion<br>
processing unit. That is, the MGW may select to determine at least one of the compression<br>
coding method and the encapsulation method used for corresponding data between two sides<br>
of the MGW to perform a corresponding conversion processing according to the<br>
determination result.<br>
Optionally, the MGW may further include at least one of a compression coding<br>

Based on the system shown in Fig. 3, seven embodiments are illustrated below to<br>
describe in detail specific implementations of applications of the present invention during the<br>
implementation of the GSM network with IP-based interfaces. In the diagrams showing<br>
system structures of the seven embodiments of the present invention, broken lines denote<br>
signaling information and solid lines denote bearer information.<br>
Embodiment 1<br>
Fig. 9 is a diagram illustrating the structure of the GSM network with an IP-based A<br>
interface in the first embodiment of the present invention. By taking BTS, BSC, MSC server<br>
and the MGW included on the calling side as an example, the present embodiment illustrates<br>
 <br>
that the transcoding TC is arranged on the BSC side and the A interface is IP-based. The IP-<br>
based A interface on the called side is similar to that on the calling side and will not be<br>
described in detail. Referring to Fig. 9, the interface between the BTS and the BSC is an Abis<br>
interface, and the interface between the BSC and the MGW is an A interface. On the side of<br>
the MGW where the MGW is connected with the BSC is the MGW wireless side end point.<br>
The interface between the MGW and the MSC server is an Mc interface.<br>
The A interface control plane is based on the Signal Transmission (Sigtran) protocol<br>
specified in standards. In the present embodiment, in order to realize the IP-based A interface,<br>
it is required to extend the function of the management of the IP-based voice resources of the<br>
A interface control plane and to extend necessary BSSAP information. For example, the<br>
extended BSSAP message has the ability to transmit IP bearer information such as IP<br>
addresses and port numbers.<br>
The MS initiates a call containing information on code types supported, which is<br>
transmitted transparently via the BTS. The BSC receives the call request message and<br>
transmits it to the MSC server via BSSAP signaling. The MSC server acquires information<br>
about the code types supported by the calling side, finds the intersection with the code types<br>
supported by the MSC server, and forms a priority list of the code type. The MSC server<br>
transmits a message for adding a wireless side end point to the MGW via the Mc interface.<br>
The MGW receives the message for adding a wireless side end point, assigns an IP address<br>
and a port number for the call, and returns a response message for the IP address and the port<br>
number assigned for the call by the MGW to the MSC server via the Mc interface. The MSC<br>
server receives the response message from the MGW. The MSC server transmits the<br>
assignment message containing the IP address, the port number assigned for the call by the<br>
MGW and the priority list of the code type of the MSC server to the BSC via BSSAP<br>
signaling. The BSC receives the assignment message, assigns the IP address and the port<br>
number of its own side for the call and initiates the establishment of the IP bearer. At the<br>
same time, the BSC selects code types according to the priority list of the code type<br>
information or its own policy, and returns an assignment response message containing<br>
information about the code type selected by the BSC and the IP address and the port number<br>
assigned for the call by the BSC to the MSC server. The MSC server receives the assignment<br>
response message, acquires from the message the IP address and the port number assigned for<br>
the call by the BSC and transmits a bearer and code type modify message to the MGW<br>
wireless side end point. The MGW wireless side end point may establish an IP bearer with<br>
 <br>
the BSC once it acquires the IP address and the port number assigned for the call by the BSC.<br>
At the same time, the MSC server receives the assignment response message, acquires the<br>
code type selected by the BSC from the message, places the code type selected by the BSC<br>
on the calling side at the first position in the priority list of the code type and then transmits<br>
the priority list of the code type to the MSC server on the called side. In the backward<br>
transmission process, the code types of the end points related to the MGWs in the path is<br>
indicated or changed to the optimum code type, namely the code type selected by the BSC.<br>
The MSC server on the called side distributes the acquired priority list of the code type to the<br>
BSC on the called side. If the BSC on the called side supports the code type selected by the<br>
BSC on the calling side, and selects the optimum code type, a full path TrFO voice channel is<br>
realized. Otherwise, the BSC on the called side feeds back the selected code type to the MSC<br>
server on the called side with an assignment response message. The MSC server on the called<br>
side then distributes a message for changing the code type to the BSC on the called side or to<br>
the BSC on the calling side via the MSC server on the calling side. The BSC on the called<br>
side, the MGW on the called side, the BSC on the calling side or the MGW on the calling<br>
side conducts conversion between the code type selected on the calling side and that selected<br>
on the called side after receiving the message for changing the code type.<br>
If between the MGW on the called side and the BSC on the called side is a TDM<br>
bearer, and the BSC on the called side supports the code type selected by the BSC on the<br>
calling side and selects the optimum code type, the MSC server on the called side distributes<br>
a bearer format conversion message to the MGW on the called side on which a bearer format<br>
conversion from IP to TDM is accomplished. Here, the MSC server on the called side returns<br>
the negotiated code type to the MSC server on the calling side and TrFO may be realized on<br>
the called side. Otherwise, if the BSC on the called side does not support the code type<br>
selected by the BSC on the calling side, the MSC server on the called side selects one code<br>
type from the code types supported by the BSC on the calling side according to certain rules,<br>
returns the selected code type to the MSC server on the calling side and distributes the<br>
selected code type to the MGW on the called side with a code type modify message. The<br>
code type conversion and the bearer format conversion from IP to TDM are achieved at the<br>
same time at the MGW on the called side. Similarly, if between the MGW on the calling side<br>
and the BSC on the calling side is a TDM bearer, the code type conversion and the bearer<br>
format conversion from IP to TDM are achieved at the same time at the MGW on the calling<br>
side. However, the code type negotiation processes between MSC servers are different. The<br>
 <br>
MSC server on the calling side indicates that the code type selected by the BSC on the called<br>
side should be returned in the message sent to the MSC server on the called side. Therefore<br>
the MSC server on the called side passes information about the code type selected by the<br>
BSC on the called side to the MSC server on the calling side and modifies the code types of<br>
the end points related to the MGW in the path into the code type selected by the BSC on the<br>
called side. Then the MSC server on the calling side distributes information about the code<br>
type selected by the BSC on the called side to the end points of the Nb interface of the MGW<br>
on the calling side, namely end points on both sides of the core network. Thus it is ensured<br>
that code types are the same for all IP bearer parts and TC is inserted into only the TDM to IP<br>
conversion point.<br>
Fig. 10 is a diagram illustrating the hierarchical structure of the protocol stack of the<br>
signaling plane and the bearer plane of the A interface of the system shown in Fig. 9<br>
according to the embodiment of the present invention. Referring to Fig. 10, the bottom layer<br>
of the A interface signaling plane protocol stack is a Media Access Control (MAC) layer. If<br>
the protocol of the physical layer is not a hundred-megabit or gigabit Ethernet but a Packet<br>
Over SONET/SDH/GE (Gigabit Ethernet) (POS) point-to-point protocol or IP over E1, the<br>
bottom layer is a Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) layer. From here up, the second layer is an IP<br>
layer, the third layer is a Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) layer, the fourth layer<br>
is an M3 User Adaptation (M3UA) layer, the fifth layer is a Skinny Client Control Protocol<br>
(SCCP) layer and the top layer is a BSSAP layer. Signaling is transmitted sequentially among<br>
the layers. In the present embodiment, the BSSAP protocol of the BSSAP layer and the<br>
function of the management of the IP-based voice resources need to be extended accordingly.<br>
If the IP interface is a hundred-megabit or gigabit Ethernet, the bottom layer of the A<br>
interface bearer plane protocol stack is an MAC layer. If the IP interface is a POS interface or<br>
an IP over E1 interface, the bottom layer is a PPP layer. From here up, the second layer is an<br>
IP layer, the third layer is a User Data Protocol (UDP) layer, and the fourth layer is a Real-<br>
time Transmission Protocol (RTP) layer. The bearer information is transmitted sequentially<br>
among the layers.<br>
In practical applications, voice frames based on IP protocol may also be transmitted<br>
by changing the original TDM bearer of the Abis interface between the BTS and the BSC to<br>
an IP bearer. This can further lower the time delay caused by the network bearer conversion<br>
and increase utilization ratio of the transmission resources.<br>
 <br>
Also, MSC servers at the calling and called side in the embodiment may be a same<br>
MSC server or may be different MSC servers. When the MSC servers are different MSC<br>
servers, after acquiring the code type selected by the corresponding BSC, the MSC server on<br>
one side negotiates coding with the MSC server on the other side. If there is no any consistent<br>
code type which both the two sides accept, TC is inserted only in the BSC on one side for<br>
transcoding.<br>
As seen from the above-described embodiments of the present invention, an IP bearer<br>
is established at the A interface between the BSC and the MGW through the MSC server,<br>
which effectively decreases the number of conversions of voice coding formats and even<br>
eliminates the necessity of such a conversion, decreases the delay of voice transmission,<br>
increases the quality of voice transmission and saves TC resources. At the same time, since<br>
an IP bearer is used, valuable long-distance transmission resources between the BSC and the<br>
MGW are saved. For example, in the existing GSM network system, up to 4 TCs are required<br>
between the BSCs on the calling and called sides for the conversion of different code types<br>
and bearers. After the IP bearer is established at the A interface, no or only 1 TC is required<br>
between the BSCs on the calling and called sides for the conversion of code types and no<br>
bearer conversion is needed. If the Abis interface is further changed to be IP bearer, no bearer<br>
conversion is needed along the entire call path between the MSs on the calling and called<br>
sides.<br>
In the first embodiment described above, TCs are disposed on the BSC side. In<br>
practical applications, TCs may alternatively be disposed on the MGW side and an IP bearer<br>
is implemented for the A interface. In the case that TCs are disposed on the MGW side,<br>
TRAU frames may be terminated at the BSC side or at the MGW side. Specific<br>
implementations will be explained below in connection with the second and third<br>
embodiments respectively.<br>
Embodiment 2<br>
Fig. 11 is a diagram illustrating the structure of a GSM network with an IP-based A<br>
interface in the second embodiment of the present invention. In the present embodiment, the<br>
BTS, BSC, MSC server and the MGW included on the calling side are taken as an example.<br>
The MSC servers and the MGWs on the calling side and the called side may be the same<br>
MSC server and the same MGW, respectively. TCs are disposed on the MGW side and<br>
 <br>
TRAU frames are terminated at the BSC side. That is, between the BSC and the MGW is an<br>
A interface which realizes IP bearer, and the encapsulation and transmission of services to be<br>
transmitted are realized using an IP-based encapsulation method between the BSC and the<br>
MGW. For example, services to be transmitted such as compression coded voice services are<br>
encapsulated in IP messages, IP-based User Data Protocol messages or IP-based RTP<br>
messages.<br>
The A interface control plane is based on the Sigtran protocol bearer specified in<br>
standards. The resources management function of the IP voice bearer needs to be extended.<br>
The BSSAP information is extended to enable the extended BSSAP information to transmit<br>
IP bearer information such as IP addresses and port numbers. The A interface service plane<br>
utilizes an IP bearer.<br>
The establishment of IP bearer connection at the A interface of the system shown in<br>
Fig. 11 is similar to that of Fig. 9 with the difference that code type conversions are all<br>
performed at the MGW instead of the BSC. After the BSC selects a code type, the BSC<br>
incorporates the information on the code type selected by the BSC into the assignment<br>
response message of the MSC server via BSSAP signaling and the MSC server is in charge of<br>
code type negotiation. If the BSC on the called side supports the code type selected by the<br>
BSC on the calling side, and the optimum code type is selected, TrFO of the voice channel is<br>
realized. Otherwise, the MSC server on the called side receives the assignment response<br>
message of the BSC on the called side and distributes the code type selected by the BSC on<br>
the called side to the MGW wireless side end point on the called side via a code type modify<br>
command through the Mc interface. Alternatively, the MSC server on the called side<br>
forwards the code type selected by the BSC on the called side to the MSC server on the<br>
calling side. The MSC server on the calling side distributes the code type selected by the BSC<br>
on the called side to the Nb side end point of the MGW on the calling side via a code type<br>
change command. After receiving the command, the MGW compares the code type with that<br>
selected by the BSC on the calling side. If they are not the same, TCs are inserted.<br>
The hierarchical structure of protocol stack on the A/Ater interface signaling plane is<br>
the same as that shown in Fig. 10.<br>
If only one side of the A interface on the calling/called sides is IP-based while the<br>
other side is of TDM, the code type conversion always occurs at the MGW of which the A<br>
interface is of TDM. The specific implementation is similar to that of the first embodiment.<br>
 <br>
Similarly, the original TDM bearer at the Abis interface between the BTS and the<br>
BSC may also be replaced with an IP bearer to further reduce the time delay caused by<br>
network bearer conversion and increase utilization ratio of transmission resources.<br>
In the case that TCs are disposed on the MGW side and TRAU frames are terminated<br>
on the BSC side, an embodiment of the present invention also provides detailed<br>
implementation solutions for the A interface, Nb interface and Mc interface, which will be<br>
described one by one below.<br>
I. Voice Protocol Stack at the A interface<br>
Fig. 12 is a diagram illustrating the voice message encapsulation structure at the Abis<br>
interface according to the second embodiment of the present invention. Referring to Fig. 12,<br>
no matter whether the Abis interface is based on IP or TDM, the TRAU in the BSC uniformly<br>
encapsulates voice messages at the Abis interface into an RTP encapsulation format without<br>
any user plane (UP), which includes from bottom to top an MAC or PPP protocol layer, an IP<br>
layer, an UDP layer, an RTP layer and a payload layer.<br>
The corresponding bottom layer is an MAC layer for an FE (Fast Ethernet) or a GE<br>
(Gigabit Ethernet) interface and is a PPP layer for a POS and IP over El interface.<br>
For a coding method of EFR, FR or HR, the Payload layer of the corresponding top<br>
layer bears the payload of the voice messages. For its specific byte order encapsulation<br>
format, the encapsulation method defined in the European Telecommunications Standards<br>
Institute (ETSI) standard (ETSI ts_101318) may be used. For the AMR coding method, since<br>
it is a variable rate voice coding with a process of adjusting in-band voice rate, the<br>
encapsulation method defined in the Internet Engineering Task Force Request For Comments<br>
(IETF RFC3267) standard is used for the corresponding Payload layer.<br>
In embodiments of the present invention, to be in accordance with TRAU, the packet<br>
time for voice service may be uniformly set as 20 ms specifically.<br>
Taking GSM as an example, the coding methods often used include EFR, FR, HR or<br>
AMR. Each of the clock rates for EFR and FR is 8000 Hz. The Payload Type (PT) for FR is a<br>
static 3. The PT for EFR is dynamic (96-127).<br>
In the case of FR coding method, corresponding processing is relatively simple due to<br>
the static PT.<br>
 <br>
In the case of EFR coding method, due to the PT of EFR coding for A interface, the<br>
BSSAP signaling needs to be extended so that the PT of EFR between the BSC and the<br>
MGW is negotiated between the MSC server and the BSC. Alternatively, the corresponding<br>
PT is preconfigured at the MSC server and then distributed to the BSC and the MGW via the<br>
BSSAP message and the Mc message. Alternatively, the corresponding PT (with its value<br>
ranging 96-127) is determined by configurations on the BSC and the MGW and it is enough<br>
to keep both sides the same.<br>
For other coding methods such as HR, it may be implemented with reference to the<br>
PT determining method described above, for example, being consistent with EFR or using a<br>
dynamic PT, for which detailed description is omitted.<br>
Definitions of PT values corresponding to different coding methods and data services<br>
may be the following values specifically:<br>
FR:3;<br>
EFR: 96-127;<br>
HR: 96-127;<br>
AMR: 96-127;<br>
DATA(data service): 96-127;<br>
RED(redundancy): 96-127;<br>
For each of the EFR, HR, AMR or data services, the data redundancies are all<br>
dynamic PTs with specific values collectively distributed to the MGW and the BSC by the<br>
MSC server.<br>
Corresponding PTIME (packet time): 20ms.<br>
DTX (Discontinuous transmission): Both the BSS and the MGW need support.<br>
II. Implementation of the Mc interface<br>
The MSC server provides the bearer information of the A interface to the MGW via<br>
the Mc interface.<br>
Specifically, the BSC reports its own bearer information such as the IP address and<br>
the port number to the MSC server via the extended BSSAP message, and the MSC server<br>
distributes the bearer information from the BSC and the code type negotiation result to the<br>
MGW. At the same time, the MSC server further receives the bearer information of MGW<br>
transmitted from the MGW and distributes it to the BSC.<br>
 <br>
For different coding methods, the SDP (Session Description Protocol) message of the<br>
bearer information distributed by the MSC server is defined as follows:<br>
(1)FR coding<br>
c= IN IP4 10.10.10.1;<br>
m=audio 49120 RTP/AVP 3;<br>
a=ptime:20;<br>
Where c refers to the connection information, m refers to the media name and the<br>
transmission address and a=ptime refers to the packet time.<br>
(2)	EFR coding<br>
c= IN IP4 10.10.10.1;<br>
m=audio 49120 RTP/AVP 98;<br>
a=rtpmap:98 GSM-EFR/8000;<br>
a=ptime:20;<br>
Where a=rtpmap refers to the media attribute lines, namely coding name.<br>
(3)	HR coding<br>
c= IN IP4 10.10.10.1;<br>
m=audio 49120 RTP/AVP 98;<br>
a=rtpmap:98 GSM-HR/8000;<br>
a=ptime:20;<br>
(4)	AMR coding<br>
See detailed definition in RFC3267.<br>
c= IN IP4 10.10.10.1;<br>
m=audio 49120 RTP/AVP 97;<br>
a=rtpmap:97 AMR/8000/1;<br>
a=fmtp:97 mode-set=0,2,5,7;<br>
a=maxptime:20;<br>
(5)	Data service<br>
c= IN IP4 10.10.10.1;<br>
m=DATA 49120 RTP/AVP 97;<br>
SERVER ensures that the above PTs are different from each other.<br>
III. Implementation of the Nb interface<br>
 <br>
The corresponding PT is negotiated by the Nb interface using the IPBCP.<br>
To realize TRFO, the processing at the Nb interface should be kept consistent with<br>
that at the A interface as much as possible. For a 2G to 2G call, the encapsulation method<br>
without UP is used whether it is a single rate coding or a multiple rate coding. For a 2G to 3G<br>
call, an encapsulation method consistent with that at A interface is used for single rate coding<br>
and an encapsulation method with UP is used in the case that both 2G and 3G use the AMR<br>
coding.<br>
(1)	Calling procedure for single rate coding/decoding<br>
Fig. 13 is a diagram illustrating a 2G to 2G calling procedure according to the second<br>
embodiment of the present invention. Referring to Fig. 13, the call from BSC1 to BSC2 is an<br>
intra-office call and the call from BSC1 to BSC3 is an inter-office call. Whether intra- or<br>
inter-office call, the UP encapsulation method is not used for single rate coding/decoding<br>
(HR/FR/EFR). Instead, a mode in which voice messages are directly encapsulated with RTP<br>
messages is used.<br>
Fig. 14 is the first diagram illustrating the architecture of the user plane protocol stack<br>
at the Nb interface according to the second embodiment of the present invention. Referring<br>
now to Fig. 14, which is a single rate coding payload encapsulation method corresponding to<br>
Fig. 13. There are from bottom to top: an MAC or PPP protocol layer, an IP layer, an UDP<br>
layer, an RTP layer and a Payload layer. The Payload layer may include data of HR, FR or<br>
EFR coding method specifically.<br>
(2)	Multiple rate coding/decoding<br>
Fig. 15 is a diagram illustrating a networking structure of interworking 2G and 3G<br>
according to the second embodiment of the present invention. Fig. 16 is the second diagram<br>
illustrating the architecture of the user plane protocol stack at the Nb interface according to<br>
the second embodiment of the present invention. Referring now to Fig.15, which shows also<br>
a 2G to 2G call between BSC1 and BSC2. When the AMR coding/decoding is adopted, the<br>
corresponding encapsulation format is the encapsulation method specified by the RFC3267<br>
shown in Fig. 16 rather than the UP encapsulation format.<br>
The call between BSC1 and RNC1 and the call between RNC2 and BSC2 in Fig. 15<br>
are 2G to 3G calls. For a 2G to 3G call, in the case that AMR coding/decoding is used, the<br>
corresponding UP encapsulation method is shown in Fig. 17. Fig. 17 is the third diagram<br>
illustrating the architecture of the user plane protocol stack at the Nb interface according to<br>
the second embodiment of the present invention. Different from Fig. 16, the AMR Payload in<br>
 <br>
Fig. 17 is the payload of AMR. When the subscriber of 2G is the calling party, the UP<br>
direction at the Nb interface close to 2G side is CN/Outgoing (outgoing direction of the core<br>
network). When the subscriber of 2G is the called party, the UP direction at the Nb interface<br>
close to 2G side is CN/lncoming (incoming direction of the core network). That is, the MGW<br>
on the 2G side is required to accomplish the conversion from the AMR encapsulation method<br>
without UP (A interface) to the AMR encapsulation method with UP.<br>
After the A interface becomes IP-based, if the inter-office Nb interface uses the AMR<br>
mode with UP, the bearer information at the Nb interface for negotiation at the Nb interface<br>
with the IPBCP is as follows:<br>
c=INIP4.192.168.153.21;<br>
m=audio 764 RTP/AVP 96;<br>
a=ptime:20;<br>
a=rtpmap:96 VND.3GPP.IUFP/16000.<br>
After the A interface becomes IP-based, if the Nb interface does not use the AMR<br>
mode with UP, the IPBCP negotiation may be subject to but not limited to the following<br>
extensions respectively according to coding methods and data service types:<br>
(1)	For a 2G to 2G call, if the inter-office Nb interface uses AMR without UP of<br>
RFC3267 method, the bearer information negotiated with the IPBCP is:<br>
c=INIP4 192.168.153.21;<br>
m=audio 764 RTP/AVP 96;<br>
a=ptime:20;<br>
a=rtpmap:96 AMR/8000/1;<br>
(2)	If RF coding is used between offices, with its PT being a static PT, the bearer<br>
information negotiated with the IPBCP is:<br>
c=IN IP4 192.168.153.21;<br>
m=audio 764 RTP/AVP 3;<br>
a=ptime:20;<br>
(3)	If EFR coding is used between offices, the PT is a dynamic PT and the bearer<br>
information negotiated with the IPBCP is:<br>
c=IN IP4 192.168.153.21;<br>
m=audio 764 RTP/AVP 97;<br>
a=ptime:20;<br>
a=rtpmap:96 GSM-EFR/8000;<br>
 <br>
(4)	If HR coding is used between offices, the PT is a dynamic PT and the bearer<br>
information negotiated with the IPBCP is:<br>
c=IN IP4 192.168.153.21;<br>
m=audio 764 RTP/AVP 97;<br>
a=ptime:20;<br>
a=rtpmap:96 GSM-HR/8000;<br>
(5)	For an inter-office data service with UP of 5ms, the bearer information negotiated<br>
with the IPBCP is:<br>
c=INIP4 192.168.153.21;<br>
m=audio 764 RTP/AVP 96;<br>
a=ptime:5;<br>
a=rtpmap:96 VND.3GPP.IUFP/16000;<br>
(6)	For an inter-office G.711 data service of 20ms, the bearer information negotiated<br>
with the IPBCP is:<br>
c=IN IP4 192.168.153.21;<br>
m=audio 764 RTP/AVP 0;<br>
a=ptime:20;<br>
or:<br>
c=IN IP4 192.168.153.21;<br>
m=audio 764 RTP/AVP 8;<br>
a=ptime:20.<br>
It should be noted that the specific IP address and the port number information in the<br>
SDP information above are only examples and may vary in practical applications. If the load<br>
type PT information of the RTP is dynamic PT in range of 96~127, it may vary similarly in<br>
practical applications.<br>
In embodiments of the present invention, the data encapsulation format at the Nb<br>
interface may specifically be the following. For 2G to 2G data services, 20 ms packaging is<br>
used and the mode of RFC2198 standard is used for redundancy. For 2G to 3G data services,<br>
the G.711 encapsulation method with UP of 5ms is used.<br>
Embodiment 3<br>
 <br>
Fig. 18 is a diagram illustrating the system structure for the implementation of the IP-<br>
based Ater interface in the GSM network according to the third embodiment of the present<br>
invention. Fig. 18 is different from Fig. 11 in that, the TRAU frames transmitted by the<br>
system shown in Fig. 18 are terminated at the MGW side. In other words, the interface<br>
between the BSC and the MGW corresponds to the Ater interface in the original GSM system.<br>
Since TRAU frames are terminated at the MGW side, the interface between the BSC<br>
and the MGW is an Ater interface. And the A interface in the original GSM system has<br>
shrunk into inside the MGW. Sigtran bearer is used for the A interface signaling. IP bearer<br>
mode is used for the Ater interface signaling. Signaling between the BSC and the MSC server<br>
may be communicated directly via IP or may be forwarded via IP by the MGW. There are<br>
two ways for the MSC server to control the establishment of the circuit of the IP bearer plane<br>
of the Ater interface:<br>
(1)	The MSC server does not control the establishment of the circuit of the IP bearer<br>
plane of the Ater interface. With the in-band signaling mode of the bearer plane, the MGW<br>
and the BSC negotiate to establish an Ater interface channel via TRAU signaling. The MGW<br>
acquires the voice code type of the BSC by resolving the TRAU frames of the Ater interface<br>
and compare it with the code type of core network. If the code types are not consistent with<br>
each other, a TC is inserted for conversion of voice coding.<br>
(2)	The MSC server controls the establishment of the circuit of the IP bearer plane of<br>
the Ater interface. The resource management function of IP voice bearer mode and<br>
information related to the IP bearer of the BSSAP protocol are extended and the Ater<br>
interface is simulated as an A interface in the original system. The establishment of the circuit<br>
of the IP bearer plane of the Ater interface is similar to that of Fig. 9. The difference lies in<br>
that, after the MGW and the BSC establish IP bearer, the MSC server acquires the code type<br>
selected by the BSC and then distributes it to the end point of the MGW corresponding to the<br>
BSC side, hence ensuring that the code type on the BSC side is consistent with the code type<br>
of the end point of the MGW corresponding to the BSC. Then the MGW compares code<br>
types on both sides for consistence. If they are consistent, TrFO of voice channel is realized.<br>
Otherwise, a TC is inserted for transcoding.<br>
Compared with Fig. 10, the fifth TRAU layer is added in the protocol stack of the<br>
A/Ater interface bearer plane of the system shown in Fig. 18.<br>
 <br>
As can be seen from the above-described embodiments, neither TRAU frame<br>
processing nor conversion of voice coding is required at the BSC, only the transparent<br>
transmission of TRAU frames is performed.<br>
In the first, second and third embodiments described above, the transmitted TRAU<br>
frames are terminated by the BSC or the MGW. Further, TRAU frames may also be canceled<br>
throughout the network, that is, IP-based voice frames are output directly at the BTS.<br>
The specific implementations will be described below with the fourth and fifth<br>
embodiments respectively.<br>
Embodiment 4<br>
Fig. 19 is a diagram illustrating the structure of the IP-based GSM network according<br>
to the fourth embodiment of the present invention. As shown in Fig. 19, the establishment of<br>
IP bearer connection between the BSC and the MGW is similar to that of Fig. 9. The BSSAP<br>
protocol needs to be extended as necessary for transmitting IP bearer information such as the<br>
IP address and the port number. If the code type on the MGW side of the calling side BSC is<br>
inconsistent with that on the called side of the called side BSC, a TC is inserted on the MGW<br>
side for transcoding. After the IP bearer connection is established, the BTS outputs IP-based<br>
voice frames, such as IP/UDP/RTP/VOICE messages and the BSC receives the voice frames<br>
to forward them to the MGW.<br>
In the above-described embodiment, since bearer mode conversion is not required, the<br>
time delay of transmission is decreased and the quality of voice transmission is enhanced.<br>
Further, in the above-described embodiment, after the IP bearer connection is<br>
established, the BSC may alternatively not participate in the forwarding of voice frames, and<br>
voice frames are communicated directly between the BTS and the MGW, which further<br>
decreases the time delay caused by the voice frames forwarding at the BSC and saves the<br>
processing capacity of the BSC, which is described specifically in the fifth embodiment.<br>
Embodiment S<br>
Fig. 20 is a diagram illustrating the structure of the IP-based GSM network according<br>
to the fifth embodiment of the present invention. The BSC communicates signaling with the<br>
BTS and the MSC server via a signaling channel such as Link Access Procedure on the D<br>
 <br>
channel (LAPD) and a BSSAP, respectively, and does not participate in the forwarding of<br>
voice frames on bearer plane. In the present embodiment, in order to establish the bearer<br>
connection between the BTS and the MGW, the BSSAP protocol and the LAPD protocol<br>
need to be extended with respect to IP bearer information. The establishment of the bearer<br>
connection is similar to that of Fig. 9. The difference is as follows. The BSC receives the<br>
assignment message and acquires the IP bearer information and then transmits it to the BTS<br>
via LAPD signaling. The BTS acquires the IP address and the port number assigned for the<br>
call by the MGW wireless side and assigns the IP address and the port number of its own side<br>
BTS for the call. The BTS reports the IP bearer information (the IP address and the port<br>
number) assigned for the call to the BSC. The BSC then transmits the IP address and the port<br>
number assigned by the BTS carried in the assignment response message to the MSC server.<br>
The MSC server then indicates them to the MGW. The BTS and the MGW may establish the<br>
bearer if both of them know the IP address and the port number of each other. The code type<br>
used by the BTS, i.e. the selected code type carried in the assignment response message by<br>
the BSC, is completely controlled by the BSC. The MSC server distributes the BTS code type<br>
selected by the wireless side to the MGW to ensure that the code type of the wireless side end<br>
point of the MGW is always consistent with the code type used by the BTS. The MSC server<br>
conducts code type negotiation for the full path of the voice channel. If the negotiation<br>
succeeds, TrFO is realized. If the negotiation fails, the MGW on the calling side or the MGW<br>
on the called side is selected into which a TC for code type conversion is inserted.<br>
In practical applications, the MS may also switch among different BTSs. The BSC<br>
transmits notifications to the MSC server to notify the MSC server of the new IP addresses<br>
and the port numbers of the BTSs. The MSC server receives the notifications, distributes<br>
notifications for changing the bearer of the MGW and accomplishes bearer switching.<br>
The sixth and seventh embodiments are set forth below to explain the signaling<br>
control procedure of the present invention.<br>
Embodiment 6<br>
Fig. 21 is a diagram illustrating the signaling procedure of arranging a TC at the BSC<br>
side according to an embodiment of the present invention. In the present embodiment, the TC<br>
is disposed at the BSC, the BSC converts voice coding, and the IP bearer connection is<br>
 <br>
established at the calling party. Referring to Fig.21, the procedure includes the following<br>
steps.<br>
In step 211, the MS initiates a call that is forwarded to the MSC server via the BTS<br>
and the BSC.<br>
In step 212, the MSC server returns a message to the MS, indicating that the call<br>
request is being processed.<br>
In step 213, the MSC server transmits a message to the MGW for adding a wireless<br>
side end point.<br>
In steps 211-213, the call request message received by the MSC server contains<br>
information about the code types supported by the MS itself. An intersection between the<br>
code types and code types supported by the MSC server is found to form a priority list of the<br>
code type and a wireless side end point is added at the MGW via the Mc interface.<br>
In step 214, the MGW receives the message for adding a wireless side end point and<br>
returns a response message.<br>
In this step, the MGW receives the message for adding a wireless side end point,<br>
assigns an IP address and a port number for the call, and the response message includes the IP<br>
address and the port number assigned for the call by the MGW.<br>
In step 215, the MSC server receives the response message and transmits an<br>
assignment message to the BSC. The message contains the IP address and the port number<br>
assigned for the call by the MGW and the MSC server priority list of the code type.<br>
In step 216, the BSC receives the assignment message, returns an assignment<br>
response message containing the assigned IP bearer information and the selected code type.<br>
In this step, the BSC receives the response message, acquires the IP address and the<br>
port number assigned by the MGW for the call, assigns the IP address and the port number of<br>
its own side for the call and initiates the establishment of the IP bearer at the same time.<br>
Selecting a code type by the BSC to be used by itself may be selecting a code type according<br>
to the order of priority in the priority list of the code type provided by the MSC server or<br>
according to its own policy. The BSC returns an assignment response message to the MSC<br>
server which contains the code type selected by the BSC and the IP address and the port<br>
number assigned by the BSC for the call. The MSC server initiates code type negotiation for<br>
the full voice channel call via the following steps.<br>
The BSC selects a code type and transmits the code type information to the MSC<br>
server. The MSC server passes backwardly the code type selected by the BSC and places the<br>
 <br>
code type selected by the BSC on the calling side at the first position of the priority list of the<br>
code type for distributing to the BSC on the called side. If the BSC on the called side<br>
supports and selects the code type selected by the BSC on the calling side, a full path TrFO<br>
voice channel may be realized. Otherwise, the code type selected by the BSC on the called<br>
side is inconsistent with the priority order in the MSC server priority list of the code type,<br>
code type conversion needs to be performed at the BSC on the called side. For example, the<br>
calling party assigns FR/EFR, and the BSC on the calling side selects FR. The MSC server on<br>
the calling side passes the FR backwardly. The called MS supports HR/FR/EFR. The MSC<br>
server on the called side distributes FR/HR/EFR to the BSC on the called side. If the BSC on<br>
the called side selects FR, then the code type selected by the BSC on the calling side is<br>
consistent with the preferred code type recommended by the MSC server on the calling side,<br>
and a full path TrFO voice channel may be realized without inserting any TC for code type<br>
conversion. If the BSC on the called side selects HR which is fed back to the MSC server on<br>
the called side via the assignment response message. The MSC server on the called side finds<br>
out that TrFO cannot be realized in its own segment through analysis and judgment and<br>
distributes a code type modify message to the BSC on the called side to instruct the BSC on<br>
the called side to implement code type conversion between FR and HR.<br>
In practical applications, after the IP bearer connection is established, if the BSC<br>
needs to change the selected code type due to reasons such as wireless network capacity, the<br>
BSC changes the selected code type by itself and reports it to the MSC server, and a code<br>
type re-negotiation is initiated. The process is similar to the code type negotiation during the<br>
call establishment. The difference is that, the case in which the MSC server on the called side<br>
passes preferred code type to the MSC server on the calling side may occur. After the code<br>
type of the BSC on one side changes, the TrFO of the full voice channel may be broken.<br>
However, it is possible that the original non-TrFO call becomes a TrFO call through re-<br>
negotiation.<br>
Embodiment 7<br>
Fig. 22 is a diagram illustrating the signaling procedure of arranging a TC at the<br>
MGW side according to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to Fig.22, the<br>
procedure includes the following steps.<br>
 <br>
In step 221, the MS initiates a call that is forwarded to the MSC server via the BTS<br>
and the BSC.<br>
In step 222, the MSC server returns a message to the MS, indicating that the call<br>
request is being processed.<br>
In step 223, the MSC server transmits a message to the MGW for adding a wireless<br>
side end point.<br>
In steps 221-223, the call request message received by the MSC server contains<br>
information about the code types supported by the MS itself, an intersection between the code<br>
types and code types supported by the MSC server is found to form a priority list of the code<br>
type and a wireless side end point is added at the MGW via the Mc interface.<br>
In step 224, the MGW receives the message for adding a wireless side end point and<br>
returns a response message.<br>
In this step, the MGW receives the message for adding a wireless side end point,<br>
assigns an IP address and a port number for the call, and the response message includes the IP<br>
address and the port number assigned by the MGW for the call.<br>
In step 225, the MSC server receives the response message and transmits an<br>
assignment message to the BSC which contains the IP address and the port number assigned<br>
by the MGW for the call and the MSC server priority list of the code type.<br>
In step 226, the BSC receives the assignment message and returns an assignment<br>
response message.<br>
In this step, the BSC receives the assignment message, acquires from the assignment<br>
message the IP address and the port number assigned by the MGW for the call, assigns the IP<br>
address and the port number of its own party for the call and establishes the IP bearer.<br>
Selecting a code type by the BSC used by itself may be selecting a code type according to the<br>
order of priority in the priority list of the code type provided by the MSC server or according<br>
to its own policy. An assignment response message containing information about the code<br>
type selected by the BSC and the IP address and the port number assigned for the call by the<br>
BSC is transmitted to the MSC server.<br>
In step 227, the MSC server receives the assignment response message, acquires the<br>
information on the IP address and the port number assigned by the BSC for the call, generates<br>
a bearer and code type modify message and transmits it to the wireless side end point of the<br>
MGW.<br>
 <br>
In step 228, the wireless side end point of the MGW receives the IP bearer<br>
information and the code type modify message, performs corresponding processing and<br>
returns a response message.<br>
In this step, once the MGW obtains the wireless side IP bearer information specified<br>
by the BSC, the MGW may initiate the establishment of bearer to the BSC/BTS on the<br>
wireless side. The wireless side end point of the MGW receives the code type modify<br>
message, modifies the code type of the end point according to the code type instructed in the<br>
message and returns a response message to the MSC server.<br>
The processing of signaling on the called side is similar to that on the calling side.<br>
The code type of the wireless network side end point of the BSC is to be ensured consistent<br>
with the code type of the BSC side end point of the MGW by the code type modify message.<br>
The MGW is only required to compare the code types of the Nb interface and the A/Ater<br>
interface for determining their consistence. If the code types are inconsistent, code type<br>
converting TCs are inserted; otherwise, no code type converting TC is inserted and a full path<br>
or half path TrFO voice channel is realized.<br>
After the IP bearer connection is established, the BSC initiates a code type change<br>
request when code types are required to be changed or switched. After changing the code<br>
types of end points corresponding to all MGWs, the MSC server transmits code type change<br>
response message to the BSC. The BSC changes code types.<br>
In the embodiments of the present invention, by using IP transmission between the<br>
BSS and the MSS, the object of saving transmission resources may be achieved with the<br>
packet multiplexing feature of IP. In practical applications, the transmission efficiency may<br>
be further increased with relevant techniques such as Compressed Real-Time Protocol<br>
(CRTP), Real-Time Protocol Multiplexing (RTP Multiplex), Point to Point Protocol<br>
Multiplex (PPPMUX) and IP header multiplex.<br>

further in details in connection with the above preferred embodiments. It is understood that<br>
exemplary embodiments provided above are only preferred embodiments of the present<br>
