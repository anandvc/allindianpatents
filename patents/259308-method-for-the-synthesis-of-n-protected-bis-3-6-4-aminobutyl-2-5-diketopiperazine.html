				<td>RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] The present application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. § 119(e) to United States Provisional Patent Application Number 60/603,340 filed August 20, 2004.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] This invention is generally in the field of chemical synthesis. More particularly it is related to improved syntheses of A/-protected bis-3,6-[4-aminobutyl]-2,5-diketopiperazines.<br>
BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION<br>
[0003] Drug delivery has been a persistent challenge in the pharmaceutical arts, particularly when a drug is unstable and/or poorly absorbed at the locus in the body to which it is administered. One such class of drugs includes 2,5-diketopiperazines having the general structure of Formula 1.<br>
(Figure Remove) [0004] These 2,5-diketopiperazines have been shown to be useful in drug delivery, particularly those bearing acidic R groups (see for example U.S. Patent Nos. 5,352,461 entitled "Self-assembling diketopiperazine drug delivery system;" 5,503,852 entitled "Method for making self-assembling diketopiperazine drug delivery system;" 6,071,497 entitled "Microparticles for lung delivery comprising diketopiperazine;" and 6,331,318 entitled "Carbon-substituted diketopiperazine delivery system," each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all that it teaches regarding diketopiperazines and diketopiperazine-mediated drug delivery). Diketopiperazines can be formed into particles that incorporate a drug or particles to which a drug can be adsorbed. The combination of a drug and a diketopiperazine can impart improved drug stability. The particles can be<br>
administered by various routes of administration. As dry powders these particles can be delivered to specific areas of the respiratory system, depending on particle size. The particles can be made small enough for incorporation into intravenous suspension dosage forms. Oral delivery is also possible using a suspension, or as particles pressed into tablets or contained in a capsule. These diketopiperazines can also facilitate absorption of the associated drug.<br>
[0005] A conventional step in synthesis of 2,5-diketopiperazines includes the preparation of A/-protected bis-3,6-[4-aminobutyl]-2,5-diketopiperazine by thermal condensation of lysine. Conventional commercial manufacturing processes utilize (A/-benzyloxycarbonyl)-lysine (Cbz-L-lysine) to produce bis-3,6-[(/V-benzyloxycarbonyl)-4-aminobutyl]-2,5-diketopiperazine (DKP1). This process entails heating Cbz-L-lysine in m-cresol for 18-22 hours at 160°C-170°C, and provides DKP1 in an average yield of about 47.5% after recrystallization from glacial acetic acid.<br>
[0006] Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide improved methods of synthesis for diketopiperazines.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0007] The present invention provides methods for the synthesis of diketopiperazines using catalysts such that faster reaction times and higher yields are achieved compared to conventional step(s)/method(s). Utilizing the catalyst of the present invention, phosphorus pentoxide, in a cyclocondensation reaction, provides for the synthesis of diketopiperazines of higher yield and higher purity in shorter reaction times over that of conventional step(s)/method(s).<br>
[0008] The present invention provides a method for the synthesis of A/-protected bis-3,6-[4-aminobutyl]-2,5-diketopiperazine comprising the step of heating a solution of e-amino protected lysine in the presence of a catalyst selected from the group consisting of sulfuric acid (HaSC^), phosphoric acid (HaPO^, and phosphorus pentoxide ^Os).<br>
[0009] One embodiment of the present invention provides a method for the synthesis of A/-protected bis-3,6-[4-aminobutyl]-2,5-diketopiperazine wherein the e-amino protected lysine is (/V-benzyloxycarbonyl)-lysine (Cbz-L-lysine) and the<br>
product is bis-3,6-[(/\/-benzyloxycarbonyl)-4-aminobutyl]-2,5-diketopiperazine (DKP1).<br>
[0010] Another embodiment of the present invention provides a method for the synthesis of A/-protected bis-3,6-[4-aminobutyl]-2,5-diketopiperazine wherein the solution is heated to a target temperature of about 160°C to 170°C. This target temperature is preferably achieved in about 4 to 6 hours.<br>
[0011] In yet another embodiment of the present invention a method for the synthesis of A/-protected bis-3,6-[4-aminobutyl]-2,5-diketopiperazine comprising the step of heating a solution of e-amino protected lysine in the presence of a catalyst is provided wherein synthesis is substantially complete within about 10 hours of reaching a target temperature. More preferably, the synthesis is substantially complete within about 8 hours, 6 hours, 4 hours, 3 hours, or 2 hours of reaching a target temperature. Most preferably, the synthesis is substantially complete within about 1.5 hours of reaching a target temperature.<br>
[0012] Another embodiment of the present invention provides a method for the synthesis of A/-protected bis-3,6-[4-aminobutyl]-2,5-diketopiperazine comprising the step of heating a solution of an e-amino protected lysine, such as (N-benzyloxycarbonyl)-lysine (Cbz-L-lysine), in the presence of a catalyst, such as phosphorus pentoxide, wherein synthesis has a yield of greater than 50%.<br>
[0013] Another embodiment of the present invention provides a method for the synthesis of A/-protected bis-3,6-[4-aminobutyl]-2,5-diketopiperazine in the presence of the catalyst phosphorus pentoxide the concentration of phosphorus pentoxide is about 5% to 10%.<br>
[0014] These and other objects, advantages and features of the invention will be more fully understood and appreciated by reference to the written specification.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0023] The present invention provides methods for the synthesis of diketopiperazines using catalysts such that faster reaction times and higher yields are achieved compared to conventional step(s)/method(s). Utilizing the catalyst of the present invention, phosphorus pentoxide, in a cyclocondensation reaction, provides for the synthesis of diketopiperazines of higher yield and higher purity in shorter reaction times over that of conventional step(s)/method(s).<br>
[0024] The conventional synthesis of diketopiperazines useful in drug delivery, such as 2,5-diketo-3,6-di(4-fumary!aminobutyl)piperazine (fumaryl diketopiperazine, FDKP), commonly begins from the thermal cyclocondensation of e-amino protected lysine, for example (A/-benzyloxycarbonyl)-lysine (Cbz-L-lysine) (see FIGs. 1 and 2). The uncatalyzed reaction is lengthy, 18-33 hours, with yields under 50% and in some cases as little as 25%. Such lengthy reactions and relatively low yields lead to undesirably low reactor throughput in industrial applications.<br>
[0025] It is appreciated that others have used phosphorous pentoxide (P2O5) as a catalyst and polyphosphoric acid as the solvent to prepare diketopiperazines. For examples see J. Am. Pharm. Assoc, 1957, 46:391-3, Galinsky et al. wherein the authors describe using polyphosphoric acid with P2O5 for the preparation of glycine, alanine, leucine, isoleucine and phenylalanine diketopiperazines; see also ARKIVOC 2001 (ii) p. 122-134, Kappe et al. wherein the synthesis of Biginetli dihyropyrimidones using P2O5 (as the polyphosphate ester) as a cyclocondensation/dehydration reagent is described. Additionally see J. Org. Chem., 1961, 26:2534-6, Erlanger, "Phosphorus pentoxide as a reagent in peptide synthesis." Described therein is P2Os (with butanol diethyl hydrogen phosphite) used as a reagent for making a linear dipeptide from protected amino acid fragments. However, it was surprisingly discovered by the present inventors that the reaction conditions and solvents described in the above cited references resulted in degradation of the (A/-benzyloxycarbonyl)-lysine starting material and thus were incompatible with the teachings of the present invention. Thus, a catalyst that could speed the reaction and generate higher yields was sought.<br>
[0026] One embodiment of the present invention includes the incorporation of a catalyst Into the above-noted reaction to increase the speed of the reaction and to generate higher yield percentages of the present invention. The three following reagents were evaluated for their usefulness as catalysts for this dehydrative cyclocondensation reaction: sulfuric acid (HeSC^), phosphoric acid (HaPC^), and phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5) using m-cresol as a solvent. The term "substantially complete" as used herein with regard to the synthesis of the present invention refers to at least about 80% of the starting material being consumed within the prescribed time period. Reactions were carried out with each of the potential catalysts. The consumption of Cbz-L-lysine and the appearance of bis-3,6-[(A/-benzyloxycarbonyl)-4-aminobutyl]-2,5-diketopiperazine (DKP1) were monitored by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) at time points throughout this reaction. At selected time points DKP1 was isolated and its yield calculated.<br>
[0027] The presence of sulfuric acid as a catalyst resulted in a yield of about 35%, which is within the range of the uncatalyzed reaction. However, this 35% yield was achieved in only 4 hours (see FIG. 3) as compared to the conventional<br>
uncatalyzed reaction times of from about 18 hours to about 33 hours to achieve a similar reaction yield percentage.<br>
[0028] The phosphoric acid catalyzed reaction was substantially complete in that it had consumed at least about 80% of the Cbz-L-lysine by about three hours. The DKP1 was stable when evaluated within 4 hours of the reaction and the yield was found to be about 55% (see FIG. 4).<br>
[0029] The phosphorus pentoxide catalyzed reaction had consumed about 90% of the Cbz-L-lysine by 1 hour and consumed almost all of the Cbz-L-lysine by about 1.5 hours. At this point, the yield was determined to be about 60% (see FIG. 5). Thus, all three catalysts significantly increased the speed of the reaction; and phosphoric acid and phosphorous pentoxide also increased the yield percentage (see FIG. 6 and Table 1).<br>

(Table Remove) [0030] Solvents suitable for use in the reactions of the present invention include, but are not limited to, m-cresol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, toluene, xylenes and equivalents known to those skilled in the art. Additionally, as will be apparent to persons skilled in the art, various solvents have different boiling temperatures and polarity and therefore reaction temperatures and reaction times may vary between solvents.<br>

Example 1<br>
Phosphorus Pentoxide Catalyzed Synthesis of 3.6-bisf4-(A/-benzvloxvcarbonvl)aminopropvl1-2.5-diketopiperazine (DKP1)<br><br>
(Figure Remove) [0031] A 4-neck 1-L, round-bottom flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, thermocouple temperature readout/controller, nitrogen gas inlet, and short-path distillation apparatus was charged with 100 g of Cbz-ornithine, 7.5 g of phosphorus pentoxide, and 300 ml of m-cresol. The stirrer and nitrogen purge were started. The slurry was heated to 165°C ± 5°C. After formation of a complete solution (approximately 30-60 minutes), the mixture was held at 165°C for an additional 60 minutes. The heating mantle was removed and the solution cooled to 50°C. A quench solution was prepared in a 2000-mL beaker consisting of an 80:20 mixture of methanohwater (1000 mL). The warm reaction solution was poured into the stirring methanol (MeOH) solution and the resulting suspension stirred for 30 minutes. The suspension was filtered through a medium porosity sintered glass funnel and the filter cake washed sequentially with 250 mL MeOH, 250 mL deionized water, and 2 x 250 mL MeOH. The isolated product was dried overnight in a vacuum oven (50°C, 30 inches of mercury). The crude product was recrystallized from acetic acid and dried in a vacuum oven to give 58.5 g (63%) of the desired diketopiperazine.<br>

Example 2 Phosphorus-Pentoxide Catalyzed Synthesis of DKP1 II<br>
[0032] A 1-L round bottom flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, short-path distillation apparatus, a thermocouple temperature read-out/controller, and a nitrogen inlet was charged with Cbz-L-lysine (100 g), m-cresol (200 g) and phosphorus pentoxide (7.5 g). The reaction mixture was stirred, heated to a target temperature of 165°C, and held at temperature for 1.5 hours. See FIG. 7.<br>
[0033] After completion of the heating period, the reaction solution was allowed to cool to room temperature (22-25°C) and quenched with a solution of deionized water (100 ml) and MeOH (400 ml_). The resulting suspension was stirred for 30-60 minutes and then filtered through a medium porosity sintered glass funnel. The filter cake was washed sequentially with 250 mL MeOH, 2 x 250 mL deionized water, and 2 x 250 ml MeOH.<br>
[0034] The wet cake was dried in a vacuum oven at 50°C. The recovered material was analyzed by HPLC and recrystallized from glacial acetic acid (3 ml/gram of crude product) according to the following procedure. The crude dry DKP1 in acetic acid was heated to reflux in an Erlenmeyer flask equipped with a thermometer and a reflux condenser with nitrogen head and outlet connected to a caustic scrubber. After 5 to 10 minutes (to ensure that complete dissolution occurred), the heat was removed and the mixture cooled to a temperature of less than 100°C. Deionized water (1 ml/gram of crude product) was added to the flask and the resulting suspension was cooled to room temperature with stirring over a period of 6-18 hours. The precipitated solid was filtered through a medium porosity sintered glass funnel and washed with deionized water (3 x 100 ml) and acetone (3 x 100 mL). The recrystallized wet cake was dried at 50°C in a vacuum oven.<br>
Example 3 Optimization of Phosphorus Pentoxide Catalyzed Synthesis of DKP1<br>
[0035] The dehydrative coupling and cyclization of Cbz-L-lysine to form DKP1 was evaluated as a function of reaction heating time and PaOs charge. Reactions were carried out using 5%, 7.5% or 10% PaOs (wt/wt based on Cbz-L-lysine) with various heating times (Table 2). The data indicated that yield and purity were maximized using 7.5% PaO5.<br>
[0036] Subsequent experiments were designed to identify optimal conditions for the 7.5% phosphorus pentoxide catalyzed conversion of Cbz-L-lysine to DKP1. Additionally, these reactions were monitored for the disappearance of Cbz-L-lysine. FIG. 5 shows data obtained from a study in which the Cbz-L-lysine/cresol/P2O5 (7.5%) reaction mixture was monitored for DKP1 formation for 3 hours. During this time the reaction temperature was maintained at 165°C ± 5°C. Aliquots (3 mL) were removed at specified times throughout the reaction, quenched with deionized water/methanol, and the product isolated by filtration. HPLC analysis of these samples suggested that the yield of DKP1 reached a maximum after heating for 1 to 3 hours (Table 2). After 4 hours at 165°C ± 5°C, a 7-8% decrease in DKP1 yield was observed.<br>
[0037] Having identified 1-3 hours as the optimal reaction time, several reactions (100 g scale) were conducted to measure isolated DKP1 yields within this time period. FIG. 8 shows that the maximum DKP1 isolated yield (60.9%) was obtained after 1.5 hours. HPLC analysis showed this material to be &gt;99.5% DKP1. This reaction was repeated with comparable results, namely DKP1 (100.0 area %) was isolated in a 60.3% yield. The reaction was also performed using heat ramps of 4 hours and 6 hours to simulate the large volume heating times. These reactions gave yields of 59.6% and 63.1%, respectively (Table 2).<br>
(Table Remove) [0038] The optimized conditions (7.5% P2O5, 165°C, 1.5 hours) were then demonstrated twice at the 5-L scale. Again a 4-hour and a 6-hour ramp were employed to simulate the heating profile employed in production volumes. Both reactions reproduced the results obtained at the 1-L scale. The reactions have overall yields of 58.9% and 58.4% with purity comparable to the current process (99.8%).<br>
