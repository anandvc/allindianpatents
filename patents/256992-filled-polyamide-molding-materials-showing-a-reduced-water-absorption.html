COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See section 10, Rule 13]<br>
FILLED	POLYAMIDE	MOLDING<br>
MATERIALS    SHOWING    A    REDUCED WATER ABSORPTION;<br>
EMS-CHEMIE AG., A CORPORATION ORGANIZED AND EXISTING UNDER THE LAWS OF SWITZERLAND, WHOSE ADDRESS IS REICHENAUERSTRASSE, CH-7013 DOMAT/EMS, SWITZERLAND.<br>
THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br><br><br>
Description<br>
The present invention relates to filled polyamide molding materials, in particular polyamide molding materials with medium filler content, which are producible from a polyamide blend and for example by compounding with chopped or endless fibers on twin-screw extruders, and showing a combination of reduced water absorption and good mechanical properties, which results in very good dimensional stability and reduced variation of the electrical properties of the produced molded part such as antenna housings of stationary or mobile communication devices.<br>
The thermoplastic polyamide molding materials according to the present invention are suitable for manufacturing molded parts and other semi-finished or finished parts, which are producible for example by extrusion, injection molding, pressing, direct process or direct compounding, respectively, wherein the compounded polyamide molding material is directly processed by injection molding or other shaping methods.<br>
Finally, the present invention relates to the use of filled polyamide molding materials for manufacturing antenna housings for stationary or mobile communications devices. These molded parts have a significantly reduced variation of the electrical properties, i.e. the transmission or reception performance varies slightly with variable ambient humidity.<br>
Filled polyamide blends play an increasing role in the field of technical construction materials, because they have good mechanical properties. Fields of application are, for example, internal and external parts in the automotive sector and in the field of other means of transport, housing material for appliances and equipment for telecommunications, consumer electronics, household appliances, mechanical engineering, heating systems and mounting parts for installations.<br>
The particular advantage of filled polyamides is the exceptionally good bonding between polymer matrix and fillers, especially concerning reinforcing fibrous fillers. However, due to high water absorption, the dimensional stability of molded parts produced thereof does not meet all requirements.<br><br><br>
In the following, such polymers are to be understood as polyamides in the present application, which have basic building blocks that are held together by amide bonds (-NH-CO-) and which are producible by polycondensation or polymerization of monomers, such as dicarboxylic acids, dicarboxylic acid halides, diamines, aminocarboxylic acids and/or lactames. They may be homopolymers or copolyamides. The average molecular weight of the polyamides should be more than 5,000, preferably more than 10,000.<br>
EP 0 441 423 Bl describes polyamide resin compositions with good mechanical properties and relatively low values of water absorption containing necessarily polyamide 46, and an aliphatic polyamide with a ratio of CH2/NHCO groups of 6 to 11 in the polyamide backbone and an amorphous polyamide with a Tg of more than 100Â°C and optionally fillers. The values for water absorption indicated in EP 0 441 423 Bl do not yet show the equilibrium value, since it was only stored 24 h, however the lowest value is about 2.6%.<br>
EP 0 728 812 Al describes thermoplastic molding materials from partly aromatic and amorphous copolyamides which optionally contain fibrous and other particulate fillers and rubber-elastic polymers. These molding materials shall have improved mechanical properties and shall be suitable for long-term usage at high temperatures, and shall also have good solution and oil resistance. EP 0 728 812 Al does not use aliphatic polyamides as basic polyamide A), but partly aromatic copolyamides which necessarily comprise terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid, hexamethylene diamine and a cycloaliphatic diamine. Concerning water absorption of the molding materials, no information is given.<br>
EP 0 400 428 Al describes thermoplastic molding materials from partly aromatic copolyamides, optionally aliphatic polyamides with adipic acid as monomer and optionally caprolactam. The thermoplastic molding materials according to EP 0 400 428 Al shall have a good overall spectrum of mechanical properties, in particular high toughness levels. EP 0 400 428 Al does not use aliphatic polyamides as basic polyamide A), but partly aromatic copolyamides which necessarily comprise 6T units and caprolactam and/or 66 units. Concerning water absorption of the molding materials, no information is given.<br><br><br>
Therefore, it is the object of the present invention, to provide polyamide molding materials with low water absorption and good mechanical properties, resulting in very good dimensional stability and significantly reduced variation of the electrical properties of the manufactured molded parts.<br>
This object is achieved by the polyamide molding materials according to claim 1, with a polyamide matrix of a blend of polyamide 613 and/or polyamide 614 and/or polyamide 615 and/or polyamide 616 and/or polyamide 617 and/or polyamide 618 (A) and a copolyamide 6I/6T or polyamide 61 (B), respectively, and at least one fibrous or particulate filler (C), selected from the group consisting of glass fibers, carbon fibers, metal fibers, aramid fibers, whiskers, talc, mica, silicates, quartz, titanium dioxide, wollastonite, kaolin, silicic acids, magnesium carbonate, magnesium hydroxide, chalk, grounded or precipitated calcium carbonate, lime, feldspar, barium sulfate, permanent magnetic or magnetizable metals or alloys, glass balls, hollow glass balls, hollow spheroidal silicate fillers, natural layered silicates, synthetic layered silicates and mixtures thereof.<br>
Due to the low water absorption, the molded parts made from polyamide molding materials according to the present invention have very good dimensional stability and decreased variation in the electrical properties compared to molding materials based on polyamide 6 or polyamide 66.<br>
Therefore, the present invention relates to filled polyamide molding materials with low water absorption and good mechanical properties based on polyamide 613, polyamide 614, polyamide 615, polyamide 616, polyamide 617, polyamide 618, of a blend, consisting essentially of the following components:<br>
(A)	at least one aliphatic polyamide from the group consisting of polyamide 613, polyamide 614, polyamide 615, polyamide 616, polyamide 617, polyamide 618, or mixtures thereof,<br>
(B)	polyamide, build up from<br>
(b1)     60 to 100 wt.-parts units, preferably 60 to 80 wt.-parts units, more<br><br><br>
preferably 67 wt.-parts units, derived from isophthalic acid (I) in combination with hexamethylene diamine (6) in almost equimolar ratio, (b2)     0 to 40 wt.-parts units, preferably 20 to 40 wt.-parts units, more preferably 33 wt.-parts units, derived from terephthalic acid (T) in combination with hexamethylene diamine (6) in almost equimolar ratio,<br>
wherein the wt.-parts of the components (bi) and (b2) totals 100 wt.-parts, and at least one filler component (C):<br>
(C) 	selected from the group consisting of glass fibers, carbon fibers, metal fibers, aramid fibers, whiskers, talc, mica, silicates, quartz, titanium dioxide, wollastonite, kaolin, silicic acids, magnesium carbonate, magnesium hydroxide, chalk, grounded or precipitated calcium carbonate, lime, feldspar, barium sulfate, permanent magnetic or magnetizable metals or alloys, glass balls, hollow glass balls, hollow spheroidal silicate fillers, natural layered silicates, synthetic layered silicates and mixtures thereof,<br>
wherein the weight percents of the components (A) to (C) totals 100%, and<br>
wherein the components (A), (B) and (C) fulfill the following conditions:<br>
(A) + (B):	80 to 20 wt.-%,<br>
weight ratio (A) / (B):	60/40   to   90/10,   preferably   70/30   to   85/15,   more<br>
preferably 70/30 to 80/20, most preferably 75/25,<br>
(C):	20  to  80  wt.-%,  preferably  21   to  70  wt-.%,  more<br>
preferably 31 to 64 wt.-%,<br>
wherein the polyamide molding materials optionally comprise usual additives (D) in addition to the components (A) to (C), and wherein their amount is in addition to the sum of the components (A) to (C).<br>
Furthermore, the present invention relates to a method for manufacturing polyamide molding materials on normal compounding machines at cylinder temperatures of 260Â°C to 320Â°C, wherein the polymeric portion is melted first and then fillers are dosed.<br><br><br>
The molding materials according to the present invention can be used to manufacture molded parts, preferably injection molded parts, more preferably for manufacturing antenna housings of stationary and mobile communication devices. These molded parts have inter alia good dimensional stability, small change in permittivity (er) and loss angle (tan d), and good hydrolytic stability due to low water absorption.<br>
In the dependent claims more favorable embodiments of the present invention are contained.<br>
Needle-like single crystals of metals, oxides, borides, carbides, nitrides, polytitanate, carbon etc. mostly with polygonal cross-section are regarded to be whiskers, e.g. potassium titanate whiskers, aluminum oxide whiskers, silicon carbide whiskers. Whiskers generally have a diameter of 0.1 to 10 \im and a length in the range of mm to cm. Additionally, they have a high tensile strength. Whiskers can be produced by deposition from the gas phase on solids (VS mechanism), or from a three-phase system (VLS-mechanism).<br>
The glass fibers have a diameter of 5 to 20 urn, preferably of 5 to 15 um and more preferably of 5 to 10 urn. The glass fibers preferably have circular, oval, elliptical or rectangular cross section.<br>
Preferably, glass fibers, especially oval, elliptical or rectangular with non-circular cross section ("flat glass fibers") may be used in molding materials according to the present invention. These molding materials have advantages concerning strength and toughness, especially in the transverse direction, in the molded parts manufactured from the molding materials.<br>
Preferably, the glass fibers are consisting of E glass. The glass fibers may be added as endless fibers or as chopped glass fibers, wherein the fibers may be equipped with a suitable sizing system and an adhesive agent or an adhesive agent system, e.g. based on silane.<br>
For example, carbon black and/or carbon nanotubes may be used as antistatics in the molding<br><br><br>
materials according to the present invention.<br>
Using carbon black may also improve the black coloring of the molding material.<br>
Kaolins, serpentine, talc, mica, vermiculite, illite, smectite, montmorillonite, hectorite, double hydroxides or mixtures thereof may be used as layered silicates in the molding materials according to the present invention. The layered silicates may be surface treated or untreated.<br>
Antioxidants, antiozonants, light stabilizers, UV stabilizers, UV absorbers or UV blockers may be used in the molding materials according to the present invention as stabilizers and anti-aging agents, respectively.<br>
The aliphatic polyamide A) has a relative viscosity between 1.4 and 2.5, preferably 1.5 and 2.1 (0.5 wt.-% solution in m-cresol, 20Â°C).<br>
Polyamide 614 or polyamide 618 or their mixture is preferably used as aliphatic polyamide A), more preferably polyamide 614 is used.<br>
An even greater toughness can be achieved by using special thin glass fibers with a diameter below 10 um.<br>
The preparation of the polyamide molding materials according to the present invention can be effected on customary compounding machines, such as, for example, single-screw or twin-screw extruders or screw kneaders. As a rule, the polymeric fraction is first melted and the filler can be introduced at a subsequent point of the extruder, for example, by means of a side feeder. If more than one filler is used, it may be added at the same point or at various points of the extruder. The compounding is preferably effected at set barrel temperatures of 260Â°C to 320Â°C. However, the polymer portion and the fillers may also be dosed into the feeder<br><br>
 together.<br>
The polyamide molding materials according to the present invention may also be manufactured by the known methods for producing long-fiber reinforced rod-like granules, particularly by using a pulltrusion method, wherein the endless fiber strand (roving) is completely soaked with the polymer melt, and subsequently cooled and cut. The long-fiber reinforced rod-like granules obtained thereby can be processed to molded parts using the normal processing procedures; especially good properties of the molded part can be obtained using gentle processing methods.<br>
The glass fibers, which are used as roving in an alternative according to the present invention have a diameter of 10 to 20 um, preferably of 12 to 18 um, wherein the cross-section of the glass fibers is circular, oval, elliptical or angular.<br>
According to the present invention, E glass fibers are especially used as chopped glass fibers, or as endless fibers (roving). However, all other glass fiber types, such as A, C, D, M, S, R glass fibers or any mixtures thereof or mixtures with E glass fibers may be used.<br>
The polymer strand made from molding materials according to the present invention may be processed to granules by all known granuling methods, such as strand granuling, wherein the strand is cooled in a water bath and subsequently cut. At a filler content of more than 60 wt.-% underwater granuling and underwater hot cut off, respectively, should be used to improve the quality of the granules, wherein the polymer melt is directly pressed through a nozzle hole and granuled by a rotating knife in a water stream.<br>
The molding materials according to the present invention can be processed at cylinder temperatures of 260Â°C to 320Â°C, wherein form temperatures of 60Â°C to 130Â°C have to be chosen depending on the filler content of the molding materials.<br>
Another alternative for producing molding materials according to the present invention is mixing of granules with e.g. different matrices and/or fillers to form a dryblend, which will<br><br><br>
then be processed further. For example, starting from the components (A) and/or (B) and the fillers (C), and optionally the additive (D), respectively, a compound may be produced in granular form and these granules may then be mixed to form a dryblend, optionally adding additional quantities of granular component (A) and/or (B). The such produced dryblend will then be processed.<br>
The homogenized granular mixture (dryblend) is processed in a processing machine, for example a screw injection molding machine, to reinforce molded parts and/or hollow bodies, wherein further quantities of granules of component (A) and/or (B) may be added.<br>
Processing of a dryblend tends to result in better mechanical properties. However, mixing of the dryblends generates an additional manufacturing step, which increases the cost of the product and thus lowers the economic efficiency. Moreover, vibration during transport may result in demixing, due to density differences and/or size differences of the various types of granules.<br>
The molded parts made from the molding materials according to the present invention are used for producing interior and exterior parts, preferably with large requirements for dimensional accuracy, preferably in an environment with varying humidity, for example, in the fields of electrics, furniture, sports, engineering, sanitation and hygiene, medicine, energy and propulsion technology, automobiles and other means of transportation or housing materials for equipment and devices for telecommunication, in particular antenna housings for mobile or stationary communication devices, consumer electronics, household appliances, machinery, heating, or fastening parts for installations or for containers and ventilation parts of all kinds.<br>
A preferred use of the molding materials according to the present invention is the production of antenna housings for mobile or stationary communication devices. Due to the significantly reduced water absorption, the molded part and/or the housing has a significantly reduced variation of electrical properties. As described above, the electrical properties comprise, for example, permeability of electromagnetic radiation, permittivity (er), or loss angle (tan d).<br><br><br>
 The water absorption results in a weakened signal due to increasing the permittivity.<br>
The following examples illustrate the present invention without limiting it.<br>

ABSTRACT<br>
The present invention relates to filled polyamide molding materials, in particular polyamide molding materials with medium filler content, which are producible from a polyamide blend and for example by compounding with chopped or endless fibers on two-screw extruders, and have a combination of reduced water absorption and good mechanical properties, which results in very good dimensional stability and reduced variation of the electrical properties of the produced molded part, such as an antenna housings of stationary or mobile communication devices.<br>
The thermoplastic polyamide molding materials according to the present invention are suitable for manufacturing molded parts and other semi-finished or finished parts, for example by extrusion, injection molding, pressing, direct process or direct compounding, respectively, wherein the compounded polyamide molding material is directly processed by injection molding or other shaping methods.<br></td>
