THE PATENTS ACT 1970 [39 OF 1970]<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION [See Section 10]<br>
COMPAGNIE GENERALE DES ESTABLISSEMENTS MICHELIN-MICHELIN 8s CIE, a French company., 12, Cours Sablon, F-6304"0 Clermond-Ferrand, Cedex 09, France<br>
The   following   specification   particularly   describes   the   nature   of  the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br>
15-6-2004<br><br>
CROWN REINFORCEMENT FOR A TYRE<br>
The invention relates to a tyre with radial carcass reinforcement anchored in each bead to at least one bead wire, and comprising a crown reinforcement formed 5      by at least two so-called working plies, superposed and made of wires or cables which are parallel to each other in each ply and are crossed from one ply to the other, forming angles of at most 45° in absolute value with the circumferential direction of the tyre.<br>
10      French Application FR 2 728 510 relates to a tyre as described above, and more particularly to a "heavy vehicle"-type tyre, the ratio of the height above rim H to the maximum axial width S of which is at most 0.60. Said application, in order to improve the life of the<br>
15      crown reinforcement of such a tyre, and also the<br>
regularity of wear of the tread thereof, advocates an architecture of the crown reinforcement characterised by the combined presence in said reinforcement of an axially continuous ply of inextensible cables forming<br>
20      an angle of at least 60° with the circumferential<br>
direction of the tyre, and a ply of metallic elements oriented substantially parallel to the circumferential direction, arranged radially between the two working crown plies.<br>
25     The object of such an architecture is to reduce the operating temperatures at the edges of the working plies, the width of the additional ply of circumferential cables being less than the widths of the working plies.<br>
30      Some current tyres, called "highway" tyres, are<br>
intended to travel at high speed and on longer and longer journeys, owing to the improvement in the road network and the growth of the motorway network<br>
^—™—
 <br>
2<br>
throughout the world.  All the conditions under which such a tyre is required to travel without doubt make it possible to increase the number of kilometres travelled, the wear of the tyre being less, but on the 5      other hand the endurance of the latter and in<br>
particular of the crown reinforcement is adversely affected.  The lack of endurance relates both to the fatigue resistance of the crown plies, and in particular the resistance to separation between ends of<br>
10      plies, and to the fatigue resistance of the cables of the portion of carcass reinforcement located beneath the crown reinforcement, the first deficiency being greatly influenced by the operating temperature at the edges of the working plies, whether travelling in a<br>
15      straight line or under drift.<br>
The problems referred to above have been satisfactorily solved by specifying the methods of application of the principle of architecture described above.  Thus French application FR 2 744 955 claims and describes a tyre<br>
20      with radial carcass reinforcement, of an H/S form ratio of at least 0.60, and having a crown reinforcement comprising at least two working crown plies of inextensible cables, crossed from one ply to the other, forming angles of between 10° and 45° with the<br>
25      circumferential direction, and, in the absence of any ply formed of inextensible cables forming an angle greater than 45° with the circumferential direction, an additional, axially continuous, ply formed of metallic elements oriented substantially parallel to the<br>
30      circumferential direction, placed radially between the working plies, and the axial width of which is at least 1.05 times the axial width of the widest working crown ply, and preferably at least 1.1 times the width of said widest working crown ply.<br><br>
3<br>
Although the problems relating to the separation between working plies and the fatigue resistance of the carcass reinforcement cables would appear to be solved, if the operating temperatures are greatly reduced, 5      whatever the form ratio of the tyre, on the other hand prolonged travel under drift of the tyres thus constructed and having a form ratio of at most 0.60 causes fatigue failure of the cables of the additional ply, and more particularly of the edges of said ply to 10      occur, whether or not the so-called triangulation ply is present.<br>
The object of the invention is to obtain, for the tyre in question, the best possible compromise between the different qualities which the reinforcements of such a<br>
15      tyre must possess, namely the fatigue resistance of all the reinforcement elements of the reinforcement plies, the resistance to separation between plies, as low as possible an operating temperature, and not forgetting the lowest possible weight of the tyre and industrial<br>
20      cost price.<br>
The tyre according to the invention, having a radial carcass reinforcement, a crown reinforcement comprising at least two working crown plies of inextensible reinforcement elements, crossed from one ply to the<br>
25      other ply, forming angles of between 10° and 45° with the circumferential direction, and an additional, axially continuous, ply formed of metallic reinforcement elements which is placed radially between the working plies, and the axial width of which is at<br>
30      least 1.1 times the axial width of the widest working crown ply, is characterised in that the reinforcement elements of the additional ply are continuous, inextensible, substantially radial metallic elements.<br><br>
4<br>
The additional ply advantageously has a substantially zero meridian curvature, and is separated from the first and second working plies by the necessary profiled members, of substantially triangular shape. 5      "Substantially zero meridian curvature" of said ply is to be understood to mean a curvature, the radius of which is at least 2.00 times the equatorial radius of curvature of said ply.<br>
"Inextensible cable" is to be understood to mean a 10      cable, for instance a steel cable, which has a relative elongation of less than 0.5%, measured at 10% of its breaking load.<br>
Substantially radial metallic elements are elements which form angles within the range of +85°, -85° around 15      0° with the circumferential direction.<br>
The crown reinforcement according to the invention will advantageously be finished off by a so-called protective crown ply, formed of elastic metal cables made of steel, oriented relative to the circumferential 20      direction at an angle substantially equal to the angle formed by the cables of the radially outermost working crown ply, and the axial width of which is at least equal to the axial width of the radially outermost working ply.<br>
25      Whatever the solution described above, the crown<br>
reinforcement may also be finished off, radially to the inside between the carcass reinforcement and the radially inner working ply closest to said carcass reinforcement, by a so-called triangulation ply of<br>
30      inextensible reinforcement elements, forming with the<br>
circumferential direction an angle greater than 60° and of the same direction as that of the angle formed by the reinforcement elements of the ply radially closest<br><br>
5<br>
to the carcass reinforcement.  Said triangulation ply may have an axial width less than said widest working ply, which, in the crown reinforcement in question, is radially closest to the carcass reinforcement.  Said 5      triangulation ply may also advantageously have an axial width greater than the width of the widest working ply.<br>
The characteristics and advantages of the invention will be better understood with reference to the following description, which refers to the drawing, 10      illustrating in non-limitative manner an example of embodiment, and in which:<br>
-   Figure 1 shows a diagram, viewed in meridian<br>
section, of a crown reinforcement according to the invention,<br>
15      -   Figure 2 shows a diagram of a second variant of a crown reinforcement according to the invention.<br>
The tyre P, of dimension 385/55.R.22.5 X, has an H/S form ratio of 0.55, H being the height of the tyre P on its mounting rim and S its maximum axial width.  Said<br>
20      tyre P comprises a radial carcass reinforcement (1) anchored in each bead to at least one bead wire, forming an upturn, and formed by a single ply of metal cables.  This carcass reinforcement (1) is hooped by a crown reinforcement (3), formed radially from the<br>
25      inside to the outside<br>
by a first working crown ply (32) formed of inextensible metal cables made of steel, oriented by an angle a, equal in the case illustrated to 18°,<br>
30      -   surmounting the first working crown ply (32), by an additional ply (33) formed of inextensible<br><br>
metallic elements made of steel, said elements<br>
being oriented at an angle of 90° relative to the<br>
circumferential direction, and the axially outer<br>
edges of the first working crown ply being<br>
5	separated from the additional ply (33) of radial<br>
elements by profiled members (4) of substantially<br>
triangular cross-section, the thickness e2 of<br>
rubber between the ply (32) and the ply (33),<br>
measured at the axially outer end of the ply (32),<br>
10	being substantially equal to 2 mm,<br>
then by a second working crown ply (34) formed of<br>
metal cables identical to those of the first ply<br>
(32) , and forming an angle /3, opposed to the angle<br>
a and, in the case illustrated, equal to said<br>
15	angle a of 18° (but possibly being different from<br>
said angle a), with the circumferential direction,<br>
and finally by a final ply (35) of so-called elastic metal cables made of steel, oriented relative to the circumferential direction by an<br>
20	angle y of the same direction as the angle /? and<br>
equal to said angle /3   (but possibly being different therefrom), this last ply being a so-called protective ply, and so-called elastic cables being cables having a relative elongation<br>
25	of at least 4% upon rupture.<br>
The axial width l32  of the first working ply (32) is equal to 0.75 times the maximum axial width SQ of the centre section of the carcass reinforcement (1), namely 290 mm, which, for a tyre of conventional shape, is 30      very much less than the width of the tread, which is equal in the case in question to 325 mm.  The axial width L34 of the second working ply (34) is substantially equal to the width l32   since it is 286 mm.  The axial width L33 of the additional ply (33)<br><br>
7<br>
is equal to 320 mm, which represents 0.827 SQ.  In actual fact, the width L33 of the additional ply (33) is very much greater than the width L32 (L34) of the widest working ply.  The final crown ply (35), referred to as 5      a protective ply, has a width   which is very slightly greater than the width L34 of the working crown ply (34), namely 300 mm.<br>
The secant modulus of extension of the working ply (32) or of the working ply (34), which are identical in the<br>
10      present case, since they are formed of the same non-hooped 14.28 metal cables made of steel which are inextensible and continuous over the entire width of the ply, said cables being arranged with the same pitch, that is to say with the same space between<br>
15      cables (measured perpendicular to said cables), is<br>
preferably greater than 5000 daN/mm2 at 0.4% relative elongation, and in the case in question equal to 5500 daN/mm2.  As for the additional ply (33) , its secant modulus of compression for a relative<br>
20      contraction of 0.4% is preferably between 0.33 and 0.66 times its modulus of extension for a relative elongation of the same size.  In the case in question, the ply (33) is formed of hooped 27.23 metal cables made of steel.<br>
25      The tyre illustrated in Figure 2 differs from the tyre of Figure 1 by the addition of a so-called triangulation ply (31), arranged radially to the inside between the carcass reinforcement (1) and the radially inner working ply (32) closest to said carcass<br>
30      reinforcement (1).  Said triangulation ply (31) is formed of inextensible metal cables made of steel, forming with the circumferential direction an angle S of 65° of the same direction as that of the angle a formed by the reinforcement elements of the working ply<br>
35      (32) radially closest to the carcass reinforcement (1).<br><br>
