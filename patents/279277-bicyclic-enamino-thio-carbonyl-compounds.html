The compounds of the general formula (II) can be obtained by methods known from the literature (for example EP 0539588 Al) according to reaction scheme II<br>

Suitable starting materials (A-1) for preparing the compounds of the general formula (II) are tetronic acids (B, Q = oxygen, E-R3 = CH-R3 (Said, A. Speciality Chemicals Magazine (1984), 4(4), 7-8; Rao, Y. S. Chem. Rev. (1976), 76, 625-694; Tejedor, D.; Garcia-Tellado, F. Org. Preparations and Procedures International (2004), 36, 35-59; Reviews); B represents sulphur and Q represents oxygen: thiotetronic acids (Thomas, E. J. Special Publication - Royal Society of Chemistry (1988), 65 (Top. Med. Chem.), 284-307, Review), B represents methylene and Q represents oxygen: cyclopentane-l,3-diones (Schick, Hans; Eichhom, Inge. Synthesis (1989), (7), 477-492, Review).<br>
Further suitable starting materials (A-2) for preparing the compounds of the general formula (II) are secondary amines (D1 = optionally substituted carbon), N,0-disubstituted hydroxylarnines (D1 = oxygen) or N,N'-disubstituted hydrazines (D1 = optionally substituted nitrogen). These starting materials can be obtained by methods known from the literature (cf., for example, S. Patai 'The Chemistry of Amino Group", Interscience Publishers, New York, 1968).<br>
Some aminoxy compounds acting as starting components for the compounds (A-2; D = oxygen) are commercially available, and they can be obtained by known methods. A general route for preparing aminoxy compounds consists, for example, in reacting a hydroxylamine derivative which has a protective group (PG) on nitrogen (for example R" and R'" together: phthaloyl, isopropylidene, a-hydroxybenzylidene group) with a compound R1V-LG (O-alkylation; Rlv represents optionally substituted alkyl) in a diluent, followed by removal of the respective protective group. In compound R'V-LG, R'v is as defined above and LG represents a nucleofugic leaving group, for example aliphatically or aromatically substituted sulphonyloxy, e.g. methanesulphonyloxy (MesO = mesyloxy), salts of sulphonic acid, pαrα-toluenesulphonyloxy (TosO = tosyloxy), and furthermore also, for example, halogen, in particular bromine, chlorine or iodine (cf. O-alkylation). The preparation of aminoxy compounds is shown in reaction scheme III below:<br>
Scheme III<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
lternatively, when hydroxy compounds (Rlv-OH) are used, it is possible, for example, to carry out an intramolecular dehydratization reaction. Particularly suitable for this purpose is a variant of the Mitsunobu reaction (O. Mitsunobu et al., Synthesis 1981, 1-28) where the hydroxyl compound is reacted with N-prolected hydroxylamine derivatives, such as, for example, jV-hydroxyphthalimide, N-hydroxy-5-norbornene-2,3-dicarboximide or ethyl acethydroxamate, and, for example, triphenylphosphine and diethyl N,N'-azodicarboxylate.<br>
The release of the aminoxy compounds can be carried out under conditions known from the literature, expediently in the following manner: the hydrazinolysis is preferably carried out in a diluent, for example alcohol, at boiling point. The hydrolysis is preferably carried out in an aqueous, aqueous-alcoholic or alcoholic solution by heating for a number of hours. If R" and R'" together represent an iospropylidene group, acidic hydrolysis may be employed, and if R" and R'" together represent an a-hydroxybenzylidene group or R'" represents a carbethoxy group, either alkaline or acidic hydrolysis may be employed.<br>
For preparing the starting materials (A-2), it is advantageous to react, for example, compounds of the general formulii (A-3) in which A is as defined above and LG represents a suitable leaving group (for example chlorine, bromine, iodine, O-tosyl, O-mesyl) with compounds of the general formula (A-4), in which R represents the radical (D1)-Z-(D2)-R4 in which D1, D2 and R4 are as defined further above, if appropriate in the presence of diluents and if appropriate in the presence of the basic reaction auxiliaries mentioned in preparation process 2 (cf. scheme III).<br>

However, alternatively and in certain cases it is also possible to prepare starting materials (A-2) in which R1 represents hydrogen from the corresponding aldehydes (A-CHO) and the compounds (A-4) by reductive animation (cf. Houben-Weyl, Methoden der Organischen Chemie [Methods of Organic Chemistry!, Vol. XI/1, Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart, p. 602).<br>
General routes for preparing the starting materials (A-3) are shown in reaction scheme IV.<br>

Some of the compounds (A-3, R1 = hydrogen) are commercially available, some are known, or they can be obtained by known methods (for example 2-chloro-5-chloromethyl-l,3-thiazole: DE3 631 538 (1988), EP 446 913 (1991), EP 780 384 (1997), EP 775 700 (1997), EP 794 180 (1997), WO 9 710 226 (1997); 6-chloro-3-chloromethylpyridine: DE 3 630 046 Al (1988), EP 373 464 A2 (1990), EP 373 464 A2 (1990), EP 393 453 A2 (1990), EP 569 947 Al (1993); 6-chloro-3-bromomethylpyridine: I.

Chem. 65, 7718-7722 (2000); 2-methyl-3-chloromethylpyridine: EP 302 389 A2 (1989); 2-trifluoromethyl-3-chloromethyl-pyridine: WO 2004082616 A2 (2004); 3-chloro-6-chloromethylpyridazine: EP 284 174 Al (1988); 2-chloro-5-pyrazinylmethyl chloride: J. Heterocycl. Chem. 23, 149-151 (1986); 2-chloro-5-pyrazinylmethyl bromide: JP 05 239 034 A2 (1993).<br>
Methyl-substituted aromatic or heterocyclic compounds (A-CH3) cau be converted, for example, by oxidation into corresponding aromatic or heterocyclic carboxylic acids (A-COOH, for example 5-fluoro-6-bromonieotinic acid: F. L. Setliff, G. O. Rankin, J. Chem. Eng. Data (1972), 17, 515-516; 5-chloro-6-bromonicotinic acid and 5,6-dibromonicotinic acid: F. L. Setliff et al., J. Chem. Eng. Data (1981), 26, 332-333; 5-iodo-6-bromonicotinic acid: F. L. Setliff et al., J. Chem. Eng. Data (1978), 23, 96-97; 5-fluoro-6-iodonicotinic acid and 5-bromo-6-iodonicotinic acid: F.L. Setliff et al., J. Chem. Eng. Data (1973), 18, 449-450; 5-chloro-6-iodonicotinic acid: F. L. Setliff, J. E. Lane J. Chem. Eng. Data (1976), 21, 246-247) or carboxylic esters (for example methyl 5-methyl-6-fluoronicotinate: WO 9833772 Al, 1998; methyl 5-methyl-6-bromonicotinate: WO 9730032 Al, 1997). Also described in the prior art is the synthesis of formyl group-containing aromatic or heterocyclic compounds (A-CHO, for example 6-chloro-3-formyl-5-methylpyridine: DE 4429465 Al, 1996) from non-cyclic starting components; this can be achieved, for example, by 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition (for example: 5-chloromethyl-3-bromoisoxazole: P. Pevarello, M. Varasi Synth. Commun. (1992), 22, 1939-1948).<br>
The aromatic or heteroaromatic cyclic carboxylic acids (A-COOH) or alkylcarbonyl compounds (A-CO-R1; R1 = alkyl) can then be converted by methods known from the literature into the corresponding aromatic or heterocyclic hydroxyalkyl compounds (A-CH(R')-OH; Rl = H, alkyl) which are then converted by methods known from the literature into activated aromatic or heterocyclic hydroxymethyl compounds (A-CH(R')-LG, LG = O-tosyl, O-mesyl) or aromatic or heterocyclic halomethyl compounds (A-CH(R')-LG, LG = Hal). The latter can also be obtained from the corresponding methyl group-containing aromatic or heterocyclic compounds (A-CH3) using suitable halogenating agents known from the literature. Examples for this procedure which may be mentioned are the synthesis of the halomethyl-substituted heterocycles: 5-chloromethyl-2-methylpyrimidine (U. Eiermann et al., Chem. Ber. (1990), 123, 1885-9); 3-chloromethyl-5-bromo-6-chloropyridine, 3-bromo-5-iodo-6-chloropyridine (S. Kagabu et al., J. Pestic. Sci. (2005), 30, 409-413).<br>
Starting materials (A-10) in which A represents a 5,6-disubstituted pyrid-3-yl radical can also be obtained by methods known from the literature. Suitable starting materials known from the literature are, for example, the 6-halo-substituted 5-nitro-p-picolines (A-5) which can be modified<br>
 <br>
according to known literature procedures, as shown in reaction scheme V.<br>
X, Y = halogen, for example fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine LG = halogen, O-mesyl, O-tosyl,<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
The reduction of the nitro group in 6-halo-substituted 5-nitro-P-pieolines (A-5), for example, gives 6-halo-substituted 5-amino-p-picolines (A-6, for example 5-amino-6-chloro-(3-picoline and 5-amino-6-bromo-P-picoline: Setliff, F. L. Org. Preparations and Preparations Int. (1971), 3, 217-222; Kagabu, S. et ill. J. Pestic. Sci. (2005), 30, 409-413). Subsequent diazotization and Sandmeyer reaction (C. F. H. Allen, J. R. Thirtle, Org. Synth., Coll. Vol. Ill, 1955, p. 136) allows the introduction of halogen substituents in the 5-position (A-7, for example 5-fluoro-6-chloro-P-picoline and 5-fluoro-6-bromo-p-picoline: Setliff, F. L. Org. Preparations and Preparations Int. (1971), 3, 217-222; 5-iodo-6-chloro-p-picoline: Kagabu, S. et al. J. Pestic. Sci. (2005), 30, 409-413; 5,6-dichloropicoline: Setliff, F. L.; Lane, J. E. J. Chem. Engineering Data (1976), 21, 246-247). The oxidation of the methyl group in the 5,6-disubstituted P-picolines (A-7) then leads to the corresponding 5,6-disubstituted nicotinic acids (A-8, for example 5-fluoro-6-chloronicotinic acid and 5-fluoro-6-bromonicotinic acid: Setliff F. L., Rankin G. O. J. Chem. Engineering Data (1972), 17, 515-516; 5-bromo-6-fluoronicotinic acid, 5-bromo-6-chloronicotinic acid and 5-bromo-6-bromonicotinic acid: F. L. Setliff J. Chem. Engineering Data (1970), 15, 590-591; 5-chloro-6-bromonicotinic acid and 5-iodo-6-bromonicotinic acid: Setliff, F. L., Greene, J. S. J. Chem. Engineering Data (1978), 23, 96-97; also known is 5-chloro-6-trifluoromethylnicotinic acid: F. Cottet et al., Synthesis (2004), 10, 1619-1624), which can be converted in the presence of reducing agents into the corresponding hydroxymethylated pyridines (A-9) (for example 5-bromo-6-chloro-3-hydroxymethylpyridine: Kagabu, S. et al., J. Pestic. Sci. (2005), 30, 409-413).<br>
In 6-chloro-5-nitrouicotinic acid (A-8, X=C1, Y=N02; Boyer, J. H.; Schoen, W., J. Am. Chem. Soc.  (1956),  78,  423-425),  it is possible to  form,  by reduction,  6-chloro-3-hydroxymethyl-<br>
5-nitropyridine (A-9, X=C1, Y=N02; Kagabu, S. et al., J. Med. Chem. (2000), 43, 5003-5009) which is then reduced to give 6-chloro-3-hydroxymethyl-5-aminopyridine (A-9, X=C1, Y=NH2; Kagabu, S. et al., J. Med. Chem. (2000), 43, 5003-5009) and, via diazotization and reaction with hydroxylamine, converted into 6-chloro-3-hydroxymethyl-5-azidopyridine (A-9, X=C1, Y=N3; Kagabu, S. et al., .1. Med. Chem. (2000), 43, 5003-5009). Subsequent halogenation with thionyl chloride gives 6-chloro-3-chloromethyl-5-azidopyridine (VII, X=C1, Y=N3, LG=C1; Kagabu, S. et al., J. Med. Chem. (2000), 43, 5003-5009).<br>
Alternatively, halogenation of the methyl group in the 3-position of (A-7) gives the compounds (A-10) in which LG represents halogen (for example: 3-bromomethyl-6-chloro-5-fluoropyridine, 3-bromomethyl-6-chloro-5-iodopyridine: Kagabu, S. et al. J. Pestic. Sci. (2005), 30, 409-413). When 6-halo-subslituted 5-nitro-p-picolines (A-7; Y=N02) are used, there may be initial halogenation of the methyl group in the 3-position (for example 3-bromomethyl-6-chloro-5-nitropyridine: Kagabu, S. et al., J. Pestic. Sci. (2005), 30, 409-413). If appropriate, the nitro group may also be reduced at a later stage in the reaction sequence.<br>
Also known from the literature is the introduction of substituents in the 5-position (for example Y=N3) of compounds (A-10) in which LG represents jV-morpholino. This radical can subsequently easily be replaced by halogen (LG=Hal) (cf. S. Kagabu et al., J. Med. Chem. 2000, 43, 5003-5009; reaction conditions; ethyl chloroformate, tetrahydrofuran, 60°C).<br>
In general, it is possible to replace halogen atoms in the vicinity of the pyridine nitrogen by other halogen atoms or hulogenated groups such as, for example, trifluoromethyl (transhalogenation, for example: chlorine for bromine or iodine; bromine for iodine or fluorine; iodine for fluorine or trifluoromethyl). Thus, a further alternative synthesis route entails exchange of the halogen atom (for example X=C1) in the 6-position of the pyrid-5-yl radical (for example in A-8 where X, Y=C1; 5,6-dichloronicotinic acid: Setliff, F. L.; Lane, J. E. J. Chem. Engineering Data (1976), 21, 246-247) for another halogen atom, for example iodine or fluorine (for example: A-8 where X=I; 5-bromo-6-iodonicotinic acid and A-8 where X=F; 5-bromo-6-fluoronicotinic acid: Setliff, F. L.; Price, D. W. J. Chem. Engineering Data (1973), 18, 449-450). However, this transhalogenation may also, if appropriate, be carried out later in suitable compounds of the general formula (I).<br>
In general, it is advantageous to carry out the preparation process 1 according to the invention in the presence of diluents, if appropriate, and in the presence of basic reaction auxiliaries, if appropriate.<br>
Diluents are advantageously employed in such an amount that the reaction mixture remains readily stirable during the entire process. Suitable diluents for carrying out the process 1 according to the<br>

In general, it is advantageous to carry out the first reaction step of the preparation process 2 according to the invention in the presence of diluents, if appropriate, and in the presence of basic reaction auxiliaries, if appropriate.<br>
Preferred diluents lor carrying out the first reaction step of the preparation process according to the invention are nitriles, such as acetonitrile, propionitrile, butyronitrile, isobutyronitrile, benzonitrile, m-chlorobenzonitrile, particularly preferably acetonitrile.<br>
It is, of course, also possible to use mixtures of the solvents and diluents mentioned for the first reaction step of the preparation process 2 according to the invention.<br>
Preferred basic reaction auxiliaries for carrying out the first reaction step of the preparation process 2 according to the invention are tertiary amines, such as triethylamine, trimethylamine, tribenzylamine, triisopropylamine, tributylamine, tricyclohexylamine, triamylamine, trihexylamine, N-methylpyrrolidine or N-ethyI-N-isopropylpropane-2-amine, in particular N-ethyl-N-isopropylpropano-2-amine.<br>
The reaction time is from 10 minutes to 48 hours. The reaction is carried out at temperatures between -100°C and +140°C, preferably between -90°C and 120°C, particularly preferably between -80°C and 100°C. In principle, the reaction can be carried out under atmospheric pressure. The reaction is preferably carried out at atmospheric pressure or at pressures of up to 15 bar and, if appropriate, under an atmosphere of protective gas (nitrogen, helium or argon).<br>
For carrying out the second reaction step of the preparation process 2 according to the invention, the compound is subjected to an intramolecular cyclization in the presence of an acidic reaction auxiliary, if appropriate in the presence of a diluent.<br>
Here, suitable acidic reaction auxiliaries are virtually all mineral acids, organic acids or Lewis acids. The mineral acids preferably include hydrohalic acids, such as hydrofluoric acid, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid or hydroiodic acid, and also sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid, phosphorus acid, nitric acid, and the Lewis acids preferably include aluminium(III) chloride, boron trifluoride or its etherate, titanium(V) chloride, tin(V) chloride.

The intramolecular cyclization is preferably carried out in the presence of an organic carboxylic acid, for example acetic acid.<br>
After the reaction has gone to completion, the entire reaction mixture is concentrated. The products obtained after work-up can be purified in a customary manner by recrystallization, distillation under reduced pressure or column chromatography (cf. also the Preparation Examples).<br>
The compounds of the general formula (la) in which D'-Z-D2 as a group represents -CH2-C(=CH2)-CH2- (cf. for example, preparation process 2, scheme VI) can be converted, for example, by methods known from the literature (cf. reaction steps [A]-[F]) into compounds of the general formulae (lb) to (Ig) in which D'-Z-D2 as a group represents -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- (lb), -CH2-COH(CH2-OH)-CH2- (Ic), -CH2-CO-CH2- (Id), -CH2-CH(OH)-CH2- (Ie), -CH2-C(Hal)2-CH2-(If) and -CH2-CH(Hal)-CH2- (Ig) (reaction scheme IX).<br>

(Scheme Removed)<br>
In reaction step [A], the unsaturated compounds of the general formula (la) in which D'-Z-D2 as a group represents -CH2-C(=CH2)-CH2- can be converted in the presence of suitable hydrogenation catalysts into saturated compounds of the formula (lb) (D'-Z-D2 = -CI l2-CH(CH3)-CH2-).<br>
Suitable catalysts for carrying out the catalytic hydrogenation are all customary hydrogenation catalysts, such as, for example, platinum catalysts (platinum plate, platinum sponge, platinum black, colloidal platinum, platinum oxide, platinum wire, etc.), palladium catalysts (for example palladium sponge, palladium black, palladium oxide, palladium/carbon, colloidal palladium, palladium/barium sulphate, palladium/barium carbonate, palladium hydroxide, etc.), nickel catalysts, for example reduced nickel, nickel oxide, Raney-nickel etc.), ruthenium catalysts, cobalt catalysts (for example reduced cobalt, Raney-cobalt, etc.), copper catalysts (for example reduced<br>
<br>
copper, Raney-coppcr, Ullmann-copper, etc.). However, preference is given to using noble metal catalysts, such as, for example, platinum and palladium or ruthenium catalysts, if appropriate on a suitable support, such as, for example, on carbon or silicon, rhodium catalysts, such as, for example, tris(triphenylphosphine)rhodium(I) chloride in the presence of triphenylphosphine.<br>
It is, of course, also possible to considerably increase the proportion of an isomer in the isomer mixture or even to suppress completely the formation of a further isomer by using a "chiral hydrogenation catalyst", for example with chiral diphosphine ligands, for example (2S,3S)-(-)-2,3-bis(diphenylphosphino)butane [(S,S)-Chiraphos] (N. K. Roberts in "Catalytic Aspects of Metal Phosphine Complexes", ACS Washington, p. 337 (1982)) or (R)-(+)-2,T- or (S)-(-)-2,2'-bis(diphenylphosphino)-l,l'-binaphthalene [R(+)-BINAP and S(-)-BINAP, respectively] (cf. A. Miyashita et al. Tetrahedron 40, 1245 (1984)).<br>

Here, the compounds of the formula (1c) (D'-Z-D2 = -CH2-COH(CH2-OH)-CH2-) can be isolated as intermediates.<br>
A large number of different oxidizing agents are known to be suitable for the oxidation/cleavage of a methylene grouping (cf. cleavage of (i) with formation of (Hi) and (iv) according to reaction steps [B] and [C] in reaction scheme X) (cf., for example, oxidizing agents in: Comprehensive Organic Transformations; R. C. Larock, Wiley-VCH, 1999; the literature cited on pages 1213-1215; Methods for the Oxidation of Organic Compounds; A. H. Haines, Academic Press 1985; chapter 3.4, page 117; Houbel-Weyl Methoden der Organischen Chemie, Vol. VII/2b Ketones part II, Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart, 1976, page 1287).<br>
Scheme X<br>
 <br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
This can be followed by an oxidative cleavage (i.e. cleavage of (i) with formation of (Hi) and (iv)), for example in the presence of ozone (cf. March's Advanced Organic Chemistry, Reactions, Mechanisms, and Structure, (Eds. M. B. Smith, J. March), 5th Edition, Wiley-Interscience Publication, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. 2001, page 1522 and page 1525) and with reaction mixtures in which ozone is used, such as, for example, in ozone/hydrogen with palladium/carbon, ozone/zinc or ozone/iodide and acetic acid, ozone dimethyl sulphide, ozone/thiourea, ozone/tri(n-butyl)phosphine [n-Bu3P], ozone/triphenylphosphine, ozone/trimethyl phosphite [(MeO)3P], ozone/pyridine, in the presence of permanganates, such as potassium permanganate, potassium permanganate and silica gel, in a mixture of potassium permanganate/aluminium/water, in the presence of periodates, such as sodium periodate and a catalytic amount of potassium permanganate, sodium periodate and a catalytic amount of ruthenium(III) chloride hydrate, sodium periodate and a catalytic amount of ruthenium dioxide, sodium periodate and a catalytic amount of osmium(VIII) oxide or sodium periodate and a catalytic amount of osmium(VIII) oxide/N-methylmorpholine.<br>
The oxidation/cleavage of a methylene group may also proceed via a 1,2-diol structure (Ic; cf. ii) (cf. cleavage of (ii) with formation of (Hi) and (iv)) in reaction scheme X). Numerous different oxidizing agents are known to be suitable for this purpose (cf., for example, March's Advanced Organic Chemistry, Reactions, Mechanisms, and Structure, (Eds. M. B. Smith, J. March), 5th Edition, Wiley-Interscience Publication, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. 2001, page 1519; Houbel-Weyl Methoden der Organischen Chemie, volume Vl/la Alcohols parti, Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart, 4. edition, 1979, page 592; Methods for the Oxidation of Organic Compounds; A. H. Haines, Academic Press 1985; chapter 3.2, page 73). The 1,2-diol structure may be cleaved, for example, even under mild reactions conditions in the presence of metal acetates, such as, for example, lead tetruacetate or periodic acid. Also known are acidic dichromates (cf. Chromium<br>

However, the oxidizing agents may also be attached to polymers (cf. Review: McKillop, Young Synthesis 401-422 (1979)). In this manner, both chromic acids and permanganates have been used as oxidizing agents. Also known are numerous phase-transfer reactions with permanganates, chromic acids (Tetrahedron Lett. 4167 (1977), Landini etal. 134 (1979)) and ruthenium tetroxide (Morris, Kiely J. Org.

H. de Koning, W.N. Houben-Weyl, Methoden der Organischen Chemie, Vol. E 21, Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart, p. 1953 and the literature cited therein). It is, of course, also possible to use a "borohydride resin", for example "Borohydride on Amberlite® IRA-406", for the hydrogenation (cf. A. R. Sande et al. Tetrahedron Lett. 25, 3501 (1984)).<br>

Preferred diluents for carrying out the halogenation are, corresponding to the process 2 mentioned further above, nitriles, such as acetonitrile, propionitrile, butyronitrile, isobutyronitrile, benzonitrile, m-chlorobenzonitrile.<br>
It is, of course, also possible to use mixtures of the solvents and diluents mentioned for the process<br>
according to the invention.<br>
However, preferred diluents for carrying out the preparation process according to the invention are nitriles, such as acetonitrile, propionitrile or butyronitrile.<br>
The halogenation of compounds of the general formula (I) is carried out by reacting these in the presence of basic reaction auxiliaries with suitable halogenating agents.<br>
The reaction time is from 10 minutes to 48 hours. The reaction is carried out at temperatures between -10°C and +100°C, preferably between 0°C and 60°C, particularly preferably between 10°C and room temperature.<br>
After the reaction has gone to completion, the entire reaction mixture is concentrated. The products obtained after work-up can be purified in a customary manner by recrystallization, distillation under reduced pressure or column chromatography (cf. also the Preparation Examples).<br>
To prepare the compounds of the general formula (I) in which R2 represents formyl, it is alternatively and according to the invention also possible to react compounds of the general formula (I) in which R2 represents hydrogen according to suitable methods allowing, according to reaction step [L], the introduction of the formyl group (cf. reaction scheme XVI and Preparation Examples).<br>
A suitable method for introducing the formyl group is, for example, the Vilsmeier reaction (cf. Houben-Weyl, Methoden der Organischen Chemie, vol. VII/1, Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart, p. 30; L. N. Ferguson Chem. Rev. (1946), 38, 230). Here, it is possible to use N,-methylformanilide, .N,-methyl- or N,N-dimethylformamide and phosphoryl chloride or alternatively N,N-dimethylthioformamide and phthalic anhydride.<br>
In reaction step [L|, for introducing the formyl group in the absence of an inert organic diluent, preference is given to using a mixture of N,N-dimethylformamide and phosphoryl chloride (cf. also the Preparation Examples).<br>
To prepare the compounds of the general formula (I) in which E represents CH-alkyl, it is alternatively and according to the invention also possible to react compounds of the general formula (I) in which E represents CH in the presence of basic auxiliaries with suitable alkylating agents, according to reaction scheme (XVII).<br>

(Scheme Removed)<br>
In the compounds of the formula (I) required as starting materials for carrying out the C-alkylation, A, B, E, Z, Q, D1, D2, R1 and R2 are as defined further above, the substituent R2 represents hydrogen.<br>
The compounds of the general formula (1) can be obtained by the preparation processes 1 to 4 mentioned above.<br>
In general, it is advantageous to carry out the C-alkylation in the presence of diluents. Diluents are advantageously employed in such an amount that the reaction mixture remains readily stirable during the entire process. Suitable diluents for carrying out the C-alkylation are all organic solvents which are inert under the reaction conditions.<br>
Preferred diluents for carrying out the C-alkylation are ethers, such as methyl tert-butyl ether, butylether, n-butyl ether, anisole, phenetol, cyclohexyl methyl ether, diisopropyl ether, diisobutyl ether, diisoamyl ether, ethylene glycol dimethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, dichlorodiethyl ether and polyethers of ethylene oxide and/or propylene oxide.<br>
It is, of course, also possible to use mixtures of the solvents and diluents mentioned for the process according to the invention.<br>
However, preferred diluents for carrying out the process according to the invention are ethers, such as methyl tert-butyl ether, or cyclic ethers, such as tetrahydrofuran and dioxane.<br>
The C-alkylation of compounds of the formula (I) is carried out by reaction with suitable alkylating agents in the presence of basic reaction auxiliaries.<br>
The reaction time is from 10 minutes to 48 hours. The reaction is carried out at temperatures between -100°C and +20°C, preferably between -90°C and 10°C, particularly preferably between -80°C and 0°C.<br>
After the reaction lias gone to completion, the entire reaction mixture is concentrated. The products obtained after work-up can be purified in a customary manner by recrystallization, distillation under reduced pressure or column chromatography (cf. also the Preparation Examples).<br>
If appropriate, the compounds of the formula (I) can be present in different polymorphic forms or as a mixture of different polymorphic forms. Both the pure polymorphs and the polymorph mixtures are provided by the invention and can be used according to the invention.<br>

RLO (Rickettsia-like organisms). If appropriate, they can also be employed as intermediates or precursors for the synthesis of other active compounds.<br>
The active compounds can be converted to the customary formulations, such as solutions, emulsions, wettable powders, water- and oil-based suspensions, powders, dusts, pastes, soluble powders, soluble granules, granules for broadcasting, suspension-emulsion concentrates, natural materials impregnated with active compound, synthetic materials impregnated with active compound, fertilizers and microencapsulations in polymeric substances.<br>
These formulations are produced in a known manner, for example by mixing the active compounds with extenders, that is liquid solvents and/or solid carriers, optionally with the use of surfactants, that is emulsifiers and/or dispersants and/or foam-formers. The formulations are prepared either in suitable plants or else before or during the application.<br>
Suitable for use as auxiliaries are substances which are suitable for imparting to the composition itself and/or to preparations derived therefrom (for example spray liquors, seed dressings) particular properties such as certain technical properties and/or also particular biological properties. Typical suitable auxiliaries are: extenders, solvents and carriers.<br>
Suitable extenders are, for example, water, polar and nonpolar organic chemical liquids, for example from the classes of the aromatic and non-aromatic hydrocarbons (such as paraffins, alkylbenzenes, alkylnaphthalenes, chlorobenzeiies), the alcohols and polyols (which, if appropriate, may also be substituted, etherified and/or esterified), the ketones (such as acetone, cyclohexanone), esters (including fats and oils) and (poly)ethers, the unsubstituted and substituted amines, amides, lactams (such as N-alkylpyrrolidones) and lactones, the sulphones and sulphoxides (such as dimethyl sulphoxide).<br>
If the extender used is water, it is also possible to employ, for example, organic solvents as auxiliary solvents. Essentially, suitable liquid solvents are: aromatics such as xylene, toluene or alkylnaphthalenes, chlorinated aromatics and chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons such as chlorobenzenes, chloroethylenes or methylene chloride, aliphatic hydrocarbons such as cyclohexane or paraffins, for example petroleum fractions, mineral and vegetable oils, alcohols such as butanol or glycol and also their ethers and esters, ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone or cyclohexanone, strongly polar solvents such as dimethyl sulphoxide, and also water.<br>
Suitable solid carriers are:<br>
for example, ammonium salts and ground natural minerals such as kaolins, clays, talc, chalk, quartz, attapulgite, montmorillonite or diatomaceous earth, and ground synthetic minerals, such as finely<br>
divided silica, alumina and silicates; suitable solid carriers for granules are: for example, crushed and fractionated natural rocks such as calcite, marble, pumice, sepiolite and dolomite, and also synthetic granules of inorganic and organic meals, and granules of organic material such as paper, sawdust, coconut shells, maize cobs and tobacco stalks; suitable emulsifiers and/or foam-formers are: for example, nonionic and anionic emulsifiers, such as polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene fatly alcohol ethers, for example alkylaryl polyglycol ethers, alkylsulphonates, alkyl sulphates, arylsulphonates and also protein hydrolysates; suitable dispersants are nonionic and/or ionic substances, for example from the classes of the alcohol-POE- and/or -POP-ethers, acid and/or POP-POE esters, alkyl aryl and/or POP- POE ethers, fat- and/or POP-POE adducts, POE- and/or POP-polyol derivatives, POE- and/or POP-sorbitan- or -sugar adducts, alkyl or aryl sulphates, alkyl- or arylsulphonates and alkyl or aryl phosphates or the corresponding PO-ether adducts. Furthermore, suitable oligo- or polymers, for example those derived from vinylic monomers, from acrylic acid, from EO and/or PO alone or in combination with, for example, (poly)alcohols or (poly)amines. It is also possible to employ lignin and its sulphonic acid derivatives, unmodified and modified celluloses, aromatic and/or aliphatic sulphonic acids and their adducts with formaldehyde.<br>
Tackifiers such as carboxymethylcellulose and natural and synthetic polymers in the form of powders, granules or latices, such as gum arabic, polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinyl acetate, as well as natural phospholipids such as cephalins and lecithins, and synthetic phospholipids, can be used in the formulations.<br>
It is possible to use colorants such as inorganic pigments, for example iron oxide, titanium oxide and Prussian Blue, and organic dyestuffs, such as alizarin dyestuffs, azo dyestuffs and metal phthalocyanine dyestuffs, and trace nutrients such as salts of iron, manganese, boron, copper, cobalt, molybdenum and zinc.<br>
Other possible additives are perfumes, mineral or vegetable, optionally modified oils, waxes and nutrients (including trace nutrients), such as salts of iron, manganese, boron, copper, cobalt, molybdenum and zinc.<br>
Stabilizers, such as low-temperature stabilizers, preservatives, antioxidants, light stabilizers or other agents which improve chemical and/or physical stability may also be present.<br>
The formulations generally comprise between 0.01 and 98% by weight of active compound, preferably between 0.5 and 90%.<br>
The active compound according to the  invention  can be used  in  its commercially available<br>
formulations and in the use forms, prepared from these formulations, as a mixture with other active compounds, such as insecticides, attractants, sterilizing agents, bactericides, acaricides, nematicides, fungicides, growth-regulating substances, herbicides, safeners, fertilizers or semiochemicals.<br>

A mixture with other known active compounds, such as herbicides, fertilizers, growth regulators, safeners, semiochemicals, or else with agents for improving the plant properties, is also possible.<br>
When used as insecticides, the active compounds according to the invention can furthermore be present in their commercially available formulations and in the use forms, prepared from these formulations, as a mixture with synergists. Synergists are compounds which increase the action of the active compounds, without it being necessary for the synergistic agent added to be active itself.<br>
When used as insecticides, the active compounds according to the invention can furthermore be present in their commercially available formulations and in the use forms, prepared from these formulations, as a mixture with inhibitors which reduce degradation of the active compound after use in the environment of the plant, on the surface of parts of plants or in plant tissues.<br>
The active compound content of the use forms prepared from the commercially available formulations can vary within wide limits. The active compound concentration of the use forms can be from 0.00000001 to 95% by weight of active compound, preferably between 0.00001 and 1% by weight.<br>
The compounds are employed in a customary manner appropriate for the use forms.<br>
 <br>
All plants and plant parts can be treated in accordance with the invention. Plants are to be understood as meaning in the present context all plants and plant populations such as desired and undesired wild plants or crop plants (including naturally occurring crop plants). Crop plants can be plants which can be obtained by conventional plant breeding and optimization methods or by biotechnological and genetic engineering methods or by combinations of these methods, including the transgenic plants and including the plant cultivars protectable or not protectable by plant breeders' rights. Plant parts are to be understood as meaning all parts and organs of plants above and below the ground, such as shoot, leaf, flower and root, examples which may be mentioned being leaves, needles, stalks, stems, flowers, fruit bodies, fruits, seeds, roots, tubers and rhizomes. The plant parts also include harvested material, and vegetative and generative propagation material, for example cuttings, tubers, rhizomes, offshoots and seeds.<br>
Treatment according to the invention of the plants and plant parts with the active compounds combinations is carried out directly or by allowing the compounds to act on the surroundings, habitat or storage spuce by the customary treatment methods, for example by immersion, spraying, evaporation, fogging, scattering, painting on, injection and, in the case of propagation material, in particular in the case of seeds, also by applying one or more coats.<br>
Treatment according to the invention of the plants and plant parts with the active compound combinations is carried out directly or by allowing the compounds to act on the surroundings, habitat or storage space by the customary treatment methods, for example by immersion, spraying, evaporation, fogging, scattering, painting on and, in the case of propagation material, in particular in the case of seeds, also by applying one or more coats.<br>
The mixtures according to the invention are particularly suitable for treating seed. Here, the combinations according to the invention mentioned above as preferred or particularly preferred may be mentioned as being preferred. Thus, a large part of the damage to crop plants which is caused by pests occurs as early as when the seed is attacked during storage and after the seed is introduced into the soil, during and immediately after germination of the plants. This phase is particularly critical since the roots and shoots of the growing plant are particularly sensitive and even minor damage can lead to the death of the whole plant. Protecting the seed and the germinating plant by the use of suitable compositions is therefore of particularly great interest.<br>
The control of pests by treating the seeds of plants has been known for a long time and is subject-matter of continuous improvements. However, the treatment of seed frequently entails a series of problems which cannot always be solved in a satisfactory manner. Thus, it is desirable to develop methods for protecting the seed and the germinating plant which dispense with the additional<br>
 <br>
application of crop protection agents after sowing or after the emergence of the plants. It is furthermore desirable to optimize the amount of active compound employed in such a way as to provide maximum protection for the seed and the germinating plant from attack by pests, but without damaging the plant itself by the active compound employed. In particular, methods for the treatment of seed should also take into consideration the intrinsic insecticidal properties of transgenic plants in order to achieve optimum protection of the seed and the germinating plant with a minimum of crop protection agents being employed.<br>
The present invention therefore in particular also relates to a method for the protection of seed and germinating plants from attack by pests, by treating the seed with a composition according to the invention. The invention likewise relates to the use of the compositions according to the invention for the treatment of seed for protecting the seed and the germinating plant from pests. Furthermore, the invention relates to seed which has been treated with a composition according to the invention so as to afford protection from pests.<br>
One of the advantages of the present invention is that the particular systemic properties of the compositions according to the invention mean that treatment of the seed with these compositions not only protects the seed itself, but also the resulting plants after emergence, from pests. In this manner, the immediate treatment of the crop at the time of sowing or shortly thereafter can be dispensed with.<br>
A further advantage is the synergistically increased insecticidal activity of the compositions according to the invention in comparison with the insecticidal individual active compound, which exceeds the total of the activity of the two active compounds when applied individually. Also advantageous is the synergistically increased fungicidal activity of the compositions according to the invention in comparison with the respective individual active compound, which exceeds the total of the activity of the active compound when applied individually. This makes possible an optimization of the amount of active compound employed.<br>
Furthermore, it must be considered as advantageous that the mixtures according to the invention can also be employed in particular in transgenic seed, the plants arising from this seed being capable of expressing a protein directed against pests. By treating such seed with the compositions according to the invention, certain pests can be controlled merely by the expression of the, for example, insecticidal protein, and additionally be protected by the compositions according to the invention against dumage.<br>
The compositions according to the invention are suitable for protecting seed of any plant variety as already mentioned above which is employed in agriculture, in the greenhouse, in forests or in<br>
 <br>
<br>
horticulture. In particular, this takes the form of seed of maize, peanut, canola, oilseed rape, poppy, soya beans, cotton, beet (for example sugar beet and fodder beet), rice, sorghum and millet, wheat, barley, oats, rye, sunflower, tobacco, potatoes or vegetables (for example tomatoes, cabbage plants). The compositions according to the invention are likewise suitable for treating the seed of fruit plants and vegetables as already mentioned above. The treatment of the seed of maize, soya beans, cotton, wheat and canola or oilseed rape is of particular importance.<br>
As already mentioned above, the treatment of transgenic seed with a composition according to the invention is also of particular importance. This takes the form of seed of plants which, as a rule, comprise at least one heterologous gene which governs the expression of a polypeptide with in particular insecticidal properties. In this context, the heterologous genes in transgenic seed may be derived from microorganisms such as Bacillus, Rhizobium, Pseudomonas, Serratia, Trichoderma, Clavibacter, Glomus or Gliocladium. The present invention is particularly suitable for the treatment of transgenic seed which comprises at least one heterologous gene orignating from Bacillus sp. and whose gene product shows activity against the European corn borer and/or the corn root worm. It is particularly preferably a heterologous gene derived from Bacillus thuringiensis.<br>
In the context of the present invention, the composition according to the invention is applied to the seed either alone or in a suitable formulation. Preferably, the seed is treated in a state which is stable enough to avoid damage during treatment. In general, the seed may be treated at any point in time between harvest and sowing. The seed usually used has been separated from the plant and freed from cobs, shells, stalks, coats, hairs or the flesh of the fruits.<br>
When treating the seed, care must generally be taken that the amount of the composition according to the invention applied to the seed and/or the amount of further additives is chosen in such a way that the germination of the seed is not adversely affected, or that the resulting plant is not damaged. This must be borne in mind in particular in the case of active compounds which may have phytotoxic effects at certain application rates.<br>
As already mentioned above, it is possible to treat all plants and their parts according to the invention. In a preferred embodiment, wild plant species and plant cultivars, or those obtained by conventional biological breeding methods, such as crossing or protoplast fusion, and parts thereof, are treated. In a further preferred embodiment, transgenic plants and plant cultivars obtained by genetic engineering methods, if appropriate in combination with conventional methods (Genetically Modified Organisms), and parts thereof are treated. The terms "parts", "parts of plants" and "plant parts" have been explained above.<br>
 <br>
Particularly preferably, plants of the plant cultivars which are in each case commercially available or in use are treated according to the invention. Plant cultivars are to be understood as meaning plants having novel properties ("traits") which have been obtained by conventional breeding, by mutagenesis or by recombinant DNA techniques. These can be cultivars, bio- or genotypes.<br>
Depending on the plant species or plant cultivars, their location and growth conditions (soils, climate, vegetation period, diet), the treatment according to the invention may also result in superadditive ("synergistic") effects. Thus, for example, reduced application rates and/or a widening of the activity spectrum and/or an increase in the activity of the substances and compositions which can be used according to the invention, better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to water or soil salt content, increased flowering performance, easier harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvest yields, higher quality and/or a higher nutritional value of the harvested products, better storage stability and/or processability of the harvested products are possible, which exceed the effects which were actually to be expected.<br>
The transgenic plants or plant cultivars (obtained by genetic engineering) which are preferably to be treated according to the invention include all plants which, by virtue of the genetic modification, received genetic material which imparted particularly advantageous, useful traits to these plants. Examples of such traits are better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to water or soil salt content, increased flowering performance, easier harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvest yields, higher quality and/or a higher nutritional value of the harvested products, better storage stability and/or processability of the harvested products. Further and particularly emphasized examples of such traits are a better defence of the plants against animal and microbial pests, such as against insects, mites, phytopathogenic fungi, bacteria and/or viruses, and also increased tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidally active compounds. Examples of transgenic plants which may be mentioned are the important crop plants, such as cereals (wheat, rice), maize, soya beans, potatoes, sugar beet, tomatoes, peas and other vegetable varieties, cotton, tobacco, oilseed rape and also fruit plants (with the fruits apples, pears, citrus fruits and grapes), and particular emphasis is given to maize, soya beans, potatoes, cotton, tobacco and oilseed rape. Traits that are emphasized are in particular increased defence of the plants against insects, arachnids, nematodes and slugs and snails by virtue of toxins formed in the plants, in particular those formed in the plants by the genetic material from Bacillus thuringiensis (for example by the genes CrylA(a), CrylA(b), CrylA(c), CryllA, CryUIA, CryIIIB2, Cry9c, Cry2Ab, Cry3Bb and CrylF and also combinations thereof) (referred to hereinbelow as "Bt plants"). Traits that are also particularly emphasized are the increased defence of the plants against fungi, bacteria and viruses by systemic acquired resistance (SAR), systemin,<br>
 <br>
<br>
phytoalexins, elicitors and resistance genes and correspondingly expressed proteins and toxins. Traits that are furthermore particularly emphasized are the increased tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidally active compounds, for example imidazolinones, sulphonylureas, glyphosate or phosphinotricin (for example the "PAT" gene). The genes which impart the desired traits in question can also be present in combination with one another in the transgenic plants. Examples of "Bt plants" which may be mentioned are maize varieties, cotton varieties, soya bean varieties and potato varieties which are sold under the trade names YIELD GARD® (for example maize, cotton, soya beans), KnockOut® (for example maize), StarLink® (for example maize), Bollgard® (cotton), Nucotn® (cotton) and NewLeaf® (potato). Examples of herbicide-tolerant plants which may be mentioned are maize varieties, cotton varieties and soya bean varieties which are sold under the trade names Roundup Ready® (tolerance to glyphosate, for example maize, cotton, soya bean), Liberty Link® (tolerance to phosphinotricin, for example oilseed rape), IMI® (tolerance to imidazolinones) and STS® (tolerance to sulphonylureas, for example maize). Herbicide-resistant plants (plants bred in a conventional manner for herbicide tolerance) which may be mentioned include the varieties sold under the name Clearfield® (for example maize). Of course, these statements also apply to plant cultivars having these genetic traits or genetic traits still to be developed, which plant cultivars will be developed and/or marketed in the future.<br>
The plants listed can be treated according to the invention in a particularly advantageous manner with the compounds of the general formula I and/or the active compound mixtures according to the invention. The preferred ranges stated above for the active compounds or mixtures also apply to the treatment of these plants. Particular emphasis is given to the treatment of plants with the compounds or mixlures specifically mentioned in the present text.<br>
