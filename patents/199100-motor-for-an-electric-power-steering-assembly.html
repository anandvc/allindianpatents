				<td>4. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a motor for an electric power steering assembly for assisting the steering force of an automotive steering wheel. 2. Description of the Related Art<br>
Figure 3 is a aoss-section of the internal construction of an electric power steering assembly (hereinafter "electric motor") described in Japanese Patent Laid Open No. 2000-224822, and Figure 4 is an enlargement of part of Figure 3.<br>
The electric motor includes: a cylindrical yoke (not shown); four permanent magnets (not shown) composed of ferrite spaced circumferentially and secured inside the yoke; a shaft 4 disposed inside the yoke by means of bearings so as to be able to rotate fi-eely; an armature 5 secured to the shaft 4; a commutator 7 comprising a plurality of segments 6 secured to an end portion of the shaft 4; four brushes (not shown) spaced equidistantly and placed in contact with the surface of the commutator 7 by the elastic force of springs (not shown); and an equalizer main body 10 secured to the shaft 4 between the armature 5 and the commutator 7.<br>
The armature 5 includes: a core 12 having twenty-two slots 11 extending in the axial direction; and a winding 14 constructed by winding wiring 13 into the slots 11 by a lap winding method.<br>
The equalizer main body 10 is assembled by altemately stacking terminals 16, which are eleven equalizing members, and composed of copper plate or the like, with eleven insulating plates 17 on a basel 5 composed of phenolic resin.<br>
Each of the terminals 16 has a pair of equalizing portions 16a extending radially outwards in opposite directions. The equalizing portion 16a is bent along a hook 18 and electrically connected with the hook 18 at a total of twenty-two places such that those segments 6 which should have equal electric potential with each other<br><br>
are connected through the terminal 16.<br>
Figure 5 is a set of diagrams and graphs of magnetic attraction and torque ripples acting on an amiature 5 having four poles, a lap winding, and twenty-two slots which the present inventas obtained by magnetic field analysis.<br>
As can be seen from the figure, in the case of a 22-slot lap-wound armature, the total magnetic attraction acting on the armature is also zero and operating noise due to rotational vibrations does not arise.<br>
Figure 6 is a front elevation of a brush holder of another conventional electric motor, Figure 7 is a side aoss-section taken along line Vll-Vll in Figure 6, wherein parts with the same as or corresponding to those of Figure 3 above have the same numbering.<br>
The electric motor includes: a cylindrical yoke; a magnets secured inside the yoke; a shaft 4 supported by means of bearings inside the yoke so as to be able to rotate freely; an armature 5 secured to the shaft 4; a commutator 7 secured to an end portion of the shaft 4; a brush holder 20 secured to a housing 22 having hole through which the shaft 4 passes by means of a screw 23; a grommet 24 engaged elastically in the concave portion 22a of the housing 22; and a lead wire 25 passing through the grommet 24.<br>
The bmsh holder 20 includes a base 27 constructed by insert molding a conductor 26; four holder portions 28 composed of metal secured to the base 27; a brush 30 held within each holder portion 28 with the brush 30 placed in contact with the commutator 7 by the elasticity of a spring 29; and a pigtail 40 having one end thereof connected the brush 30, and the other end thereof connecting with a connection 26a of the conductor 26.<br>
In the above electric motor, external current leads in by the lead wire 25, is supplied to the armature 5 via the conductor 26, the pigtails 40 and brushes 30. As a result, the armature 5 is rotated together with the shaft 4 due to electromagnetic action.<br>
In the case of lap winding, there are problems in that differences arise in the<br><br>
electromotive forces induced among the circuits of the winding 14 of the armature 5 due to the irrfluence of imbalances in the electromagnetic circuit of the yoke, eccentricities in the armature 5, nonuniform electric currents flowing through the brushes 9, engineering errors, etc., giving rise to circulating currents within the armature 5 flowing through the brushes 9. As a result, the commutating action of the brushes deteriorates, leading to increases in temperature, shortened working life, inaeases in torque ripples in the brushes 9 and the commutator 7 vi/hich accompany an inaease in commutation spari<s generated by the bmshes with combined effects thereof inaeasing operating noise.></s>
The conventional electric motors described above are provided with the equalizing members to prevent the above problems.<br>
As can be seen from Figure 5, in the case of a 4-pole 22-slot lap-wound armature, torque ripples (peak to peak or p-p) represented by the ratio of vertical variance in the torque wave to the total torque are 0.876 percent, the value of the torque ripples (p-p) is comparatively small. However, one problem has been that the armature 5 vibrates due to the torque ripples, to aeate operating noise.<br>
In the second conventional electric motor, one problem has been that the brush holder 20 is fixed to the housing 22 by being screwed to housing 22 with the saew 23 passing through a saew hole 31 formed in the housing 22. That is, as there is some clearance between the saew 23 and the loose hole 32 formed in the base 27, the brush holder 20 can be displaced from ifs proper position by the clearance, making contact between the brush 30 and the commutator 7 uneven, causing the performance of the electric motor to deteriorate, and shorting the wori<ing life of the brush and increasing noise.></ing>
Further, in the second conventional electric motor, another problem has been that since each of the pigtails 40 has a different bent shape, making contact between each of the brushes 30 and the commutator 7 uneven. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br><br>

The armature 5 includes: a core 12 having twenty-two slots extending in the axial direction; and a winding 14 constructed by winding wiring into the slots by a lap winding method.<br><br>
Further, segments that should have equal electric potential are electrically connected with each other by an equalizing member (not shown). That is, one end portion of the equalizing member passes through a slot of the core12, extends as far as the end face of the core 12 away from the commutator 7, then makes a U-tum at the end face, passes through another slot, extends as far as the hook 18 of the segment 6, and is finally engaged at the hook 18.<br>

Therefore, the contact condition of brushes to the commutator is more uniform, reducing the occurrence of vibrations and noise due to sliding of the brushes.<br>
Furthermore, an electric power steering assembly according to another aspect of the present invention includes: a yoke; a magnetic field portion composed of four poles secured to an inner wall of the yoke; a shaft disposed within the yoke so as to rotate freely; an armature secured to the shaft having a winding constructed by lap winding a wiring into twenty-two slots formed on an outer circumferential surface of a core so as to extend in the axial direction thereof; a commutator comprising a plurality of segments secured to an end of the shaft; an equalizing member connecting those of the segments that should have equal electric potential with each other; a concave housing having a hole through which the shaft passes; a plurality of brushes placed in contact with the commutator; a brush holder having a plurality of holders for<br><br>
