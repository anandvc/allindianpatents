				<td>LIQUID-COOLED ROTOR ASSEMBLY FOR A SUPERCHARGER<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]	The present invention relates to a liquid-cooled rotor assembly for a<br>
compressor or supercharger assembly.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	Roots-type and screw-type positive displacement compressors are<br>
employed in industrial and automotive applications. The compressor or supercharger<br>
may be operatively connected to an internal combustion engine to increase the volume<br>
of intake air communicated to the internal combustion engine thereby increasing the<br>
volumetric efficiency thereof. The supercharger typically includes two interleaved and<br>
counter-rotating rotors each of which may be formed with a plurality of lobes to convey<br>
intake air for subsequent introduction to the internal combustion engine. The efficiency<br>
of the supercharger is dependent on the running clearances between each of the two<br>
rotors and a housing within which the two rotors are rotatably supported.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003]	A rotor assembly for a supercharger assembly is provided. The rotor<br>
assembly includes at least one lobe defining at least one cavity. The at least one cavity<br>
is configured to contain a fluid, such as oil or coolant, operable to cool the at least one<br>
lobe.<br>
[0004]	In one embodiment, the rotor assembly includes a rotatable shaft member<br>
and the at least one lobe is operatively connected to the shaft member. The shaft<br>
member defines a feed passage operable to communicate the fluid to the at least one<br>
cavity. The shaft member further defines a return passage operable to exhaust the fluid<br>
from the at least one cavity. The feed passage is positioned generally along an axis of<br>
rotation of the shaft member, while the return passage is positioned generally adjacent<br>
j<br>
 <br>
<br>
<br>
to the outer periphery of the shaft member. A supercharger incorporating the rotor<br>
assembly is also disclosed.<br>
[0005]	The above features and advantages and other features and advantages of<br>
the present invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description of the<br>
best modes for carrying out the invention when taken in connection with the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0006]	Figure 1 is a schematic perspective view of a supercharger assembly<br>
configurned for use with an internal combustion engine;<br>
[0007]	Figure 2 is a perspective view of a first and second rotor assembly for use<br>
within the supercharger assembly of Figure 1;<br>
[0008]	Figure 3 is a non-planar or revolved cross sectional view, taken along 3-3<br>
of Figure 2, of two adjacent lobes of the first rotor assembly; and<br>
[0009]	Figure 4 is a non-planar or revolved cross sectional view, similar to that of<br>
Figure 3, of an alternate embodiment of the first rotor assembly of Figures 1-3.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0010]	Referring to the drawings wherein like reference numbers correspond to<br>
like or similar components throughout the several figures, there is shown in Figure 1 a<br>
compressor or supercharger assembly, generally indicated at 10. The supercharger<br>
assembly 10 includes a housing 12. The housing 12 defines an inlet passage 14<br>
configured to induct intake air, represented as arrow 16, into the supercharger assembly<br>
10. The housing 12 further defines an outlet passage 18 configured to exhaust the intake<br>
air 16 from the supercharger assembly 10.<br>
[0011]	A rotor cavity 20 is defined by the housing 12 and is configured to contain<br>
a first end second rotor assembly 22 and 24, respectively, rotatably disposed therein. The<br>
first and second rotor assemblies 22 and 24 are interleaved and counter-rotating with<br>
respect to each other. The first rotor assembly 22 includes a plurality of lobes 26<br>
extending radially outward in a clockwise twisting helical shape, as viewed from the<br>
 <br>
inlet passage 14, while the second rotor assembly 24 includes a plurality of lobes 28<br>
extending radially outward in a counter-clockwise twisting helical shape, as viewed<br>
from the inlet passage 14. The first and second rotor assemblies 22 and 24 cooperate to<br>
convey intake air 16 from the inlet passage 14 to the outlet passage 18. The first and<br>
second rotor assemblies 22 and 24 are rotatably supported within the rotor cavity 20 by<br>
respective first and second shaft member 30 and 32.<br>
[0012]	During operation of the supercharger assembly 10, the first and second<br>
rotor assemblies 22 and 24 cooperate to convey intake air 16 from the inlet passage 14<br>
to the outlet passage 18. The temperature of the intake air 16 tends to increase as the<br>
intake air 16 is transferred from the inlet passage 14 to the outlet passage 18, thereby<br>
forming a thermal gradient along the longitudinal axis of the first and second rotors 22<br>
and 24. As a result, the degree of thermal expansion of the first and second rotor<br>
assemblies 22 and 24 will increase during operation of the supercharger assembly 10,<br>
thereby increasing the likelihood of "scuff". Scuff is defined as metal transfer as a<br>
result of the first and second rotor assemblies 22 and 24 contacting one another or the<br>
housing 12. Scuff occurs when the running clearances, i.e. the clearance dimension<br>
between the lobes 26 and 28 and the housing 12 when the supercharger assembly 10 is<br>
operating, reaches zero causing an interference condition and material transfer between<br>
the first and second rotor assemblies 22 and 24 and the housing 12.<br>
[0013]	A cooling system 34, such as a loop or a simple tank, is schematically<br>
depicted in Figure 1 and is operable to cool or extract heat energy from the lobes 26<br>
and 28 of the first and second rotor assemblies 22 and 24 during the operation of the<br>
supercharger assembly 10. By cooling the lobes 26 and 28, the thermal expansion of<br>
the first and second rotor assemblies 22 and 24 can be minimized thereby reducing the<br>
likelihood of scuff. Additionally, the cooling system 34 enables tighter running<br>
clearances between the first and second rotor assemblies 22 and 24 and the housing 12<br>
since the dimensional stability of the lobes 26 and 28 during operation of the<br>
supercharger assembly 10 is improved. The cooling system 34 includes a source 35 of<br>
fluid 36, such as oil from a gear case (not shown) of the supercharger assembly 10, or<br>
 <br>
coolant from a liquid-to-air supercharger intercooler (not shown) or the engine (not<br>
shown), or a completely separate fluid circuit; however, those skilled in the art will<br>
recognize other fluids that may be used within the cooling system 34 while remaining<br>
within the scope of that which is claimed. A pump 38 is in fluid communication with<br>
the source 35 and is operable to communicate the fluid 36 under pressure to feed<br>
passages 40 and 42 defined by respective first and second shaft members 30 and 32 to<br>
effect cooling of the first and second rotor assemblies 22 and 24. Annular grooves 41<br>
and 43 are partially defined by the respective first and second shaft members 30 and 32.<br>
The annular grooves 41 and 43 are operable to return the fluid 36 to the source 35.<br>
[0014]	Referring to Figure 2, there is shown a perspective view of the first and<br>
second rotor assemblies 22 and 24 illustrating in greater detail the generally helical<br>
shape of the lobes 26 and 28. Additionally, the feed passages 40 and 42 and the<br>
annular grooves 41 and 43.<br>
[0015]	The structure and operation of the first and second rotor assemblies 22<br>
and 24 will be discussed in greater detail with reference to Figure 3. Although only the<br>
first rotor assembly 22 is shown in Figure 3, it should be understood that the same<br>
general structure may be employed with the second rotor assembly 24. Referring to<br>
Figure 3 and with continued reference to Figure 1, there is shown a non-planer cross<br>
sectional view of the first rotor assembly 22. The section is taken along 3-3 of Figure 2<br>
and generally rotates with the helix angle of lobes 26. The first shaft member 30 is<br>
rotatable about an axis of rotation, indicated at A. The feed passage 40 extends<br>
generally along the axis of rotation A and is in communication with a generally radially<br>
extending passage 42 defined by the first shaft member 30. The radially extending<br>
passage 42 is in communication with a cavity 44 defined by the lobe 26. Although only<br>
one radially extending passage 42 is shown in Figure 3, it should be understood that<br>
each of the cavities 44 defined by lobes 26 are in communication with a respective<br>
radially extending passage 42. The lobes 26 and the first shaft member 30 cooperate to<br>
define a generally annular passage 46. The annular passage 46 extends axially along<br>
the first shaft member 30 and is in communication with a return passage 48 defined by<br>
 <br>
the first shaft member 30. The return passage 48 extends generally axially along the<br>
outer periphery of the first shaft member 30.<br>
[0016]	During operation of the supercharger assembly 10 of Figure 1, the<br>
cooling system 34 provides fluid 36, indicated as arrows in Figure 3, to the feed<br>
passage 40. The fluid 36 is forced radially outward, through the radially extending<br>
passage 42, and into the cavity 44. The fluid 36 is at least partially forced radially<br>
outward by the centrifugal forces exerted thereon by the rotation of the first shaft<br>
member 30. Subsequently, the fluid 36 travels the length of the cavities 44 to extract<br>
heat energy and thereby cool the lobes 26 of the first rotor assembly 22. The fluid 36,<br>
having traveled the length of the lobes 26, is exhausted into the generally annular<br>
passage 46 where the fluid is communicated to the return passage 48 for later<br>
communication to the cooling system 34. The annular groove 41 is defined by the first<br>
shaft member 30 and is operable to facilitate the exhausting of fluid 36 from the return<br>
passage 48.<br>
[0017]	By cooling the lobes 26 and 28, the running clearances between the lobes<br>
26 and 28 and the housing 12 may be minimized while reducing the likelihood of scuff.<br>
Therefore, the operating efficiency of the supercharger assembly 10 may be increased<br>
by maintaining the temperature of lobes 26 and 28 within predetermined limits. It<br>
should be understood that with certain configurations of the first rotor assembly 22 and<br>
operating speeds of the supercharger assembly 10, the pump 38 may not be necessary<br>
since the feed passage 40 is centrally located along the axis of rotation A of the first<br>
shaft member 30, while the return passage 48 is provided on the outer periphery of the<br>
first shaft member 30. As such, the centrifugal forces exerted on the fluid 36 by the<br>
rotation of the first shaft member 30 may be sufficient to enable the pumping of the<br>
fluid 36 through the first rotor assembly 22 in lieu of the pump 38. The first and<br>
second rotor assemblies 22 and 24 may have helical-type, screw-type, or straight-type<br>
configurations for lobes 26 and 28 while remaining within the scope of that which is<br>
claimed. As stated hereinabove, the lobes 26 and 28 of the first and second rotor<br>
assemblies 22 and 24 have a generally helical shape; as such, the fluid 36 is pumped<br>
 <br>
through the cavities 44 during rotation of the first and second rotor assemblies 22 and<br>
24.<br>
[0018]	Referring to Figure 4, there is shown an alternate embodiment of the<br>
first rotor assembly 22 of Figures 1 through 3, generally indicated at 22A. The first<br>
rotor assembly 22A is similar to the first rotor assembly 22; however the cavity 44 is<br>
formed by cross drilling lobes 26A. Plugs 50, such as cup plugs or ball bearings, are<br>
mounted to the lobes 26A and are operable to prevent leakage of fluid 36 from the<br>
cavity 44 during operation of the first rotor assembly 22A. By cross-drilling the lobes<br>
26A, a conventional, i.e. non liquid-cooled rotor assembly may be adapted to a liquid<br>
cooled rotor assembly. Additionally, cavities 44 may be easier to form within certain<br>
rotor shapes, such as helix shapes, by cross drilling as opposed to investment casting or<br>
other casting methods.<br>
[0019]	In operation of the first rotor assembly 22A, the fluid 36 is<br>
communicated to the feed passage 40 and is subsequently communicated to the cavities<br>
44 via the radially extending passages 42. As with the first rotor assembly 22 of Figure<br>
3, the fluid 36 travels the length of the cavities 44 to extract heat energy and thereby<br>
cool the lobes 26A of the first rotor assembly 22A. The fluid 36, having traveled the<br>
length of the lobes 26A, is exhausted into the return passage 48 for later communication<br>
to the cooling system 34 via the annular groove 41.<br>
[0020]	Although the discussion has focused on the application of the supercharger<br>
assembly 10 to an internal combustion engine, those skilled in the art will recognize other<br>
applications of the supercharger 10 such as a compressor for industrial application,<br>
compressor for fuel cell applications, etc. While the best modes for carrying out the<br>
invention have been described in detail, those familiar with the art to which this invention<br>
relates will recognize various alternative designs and embodiments for practicing the<br>
invention within the scope of the appended claims.<br>
