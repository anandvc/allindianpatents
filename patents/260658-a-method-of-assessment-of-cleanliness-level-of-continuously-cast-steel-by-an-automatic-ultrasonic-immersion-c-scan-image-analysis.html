FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method to assess cleanliness level of<br>
continuously cast steel by an automatic ultrasonic immersion c - scan image<br>
analysis.<br>
More specifically the present invention relates to assessment of non-metallic<br>
inclusions / pores, pinholes / blow holes, segregation etc. in continuously cast<br>
steel.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In recent years, there has been a tremendous increase in the production of<br>
continuously cast steel, since the process of continuous casting is a faster<br>
method of steel casting from liquid steel at reduced production cost when<br>
compared with the conventional ingot route of casting. However, at the same<br>
time, more attention has been paid to improve product quality with respect to<br>
overall cleanliness level in order to improve reliability of the finished products,<br><br>
which has led to production of continuously cast product of high quality. A clean<br>
steel greatly affect many physical and mechanical properties like fatigue life,<br>
machinability and corrosion resistance. Superclean steel with respect to<br>
macroscopic oxide inclusions are a prerequisite for improved surface finish and<br>
prolonged lifetime of components as well as for the application of increasingly<br>
stringent forming processes. Presence of macro-inclusions can generate sliver<br>
defects during cold rolling for thinner gauge steel strips and can also become the<br>
reason for wire breakage during wire drawing for very thin sections.<br>
Traditional methods of measuring cleanliness level of steel is to measure its total<br>
oxygen which does not provide information about the size, location and<br>
distribution of more harmful macro-inclusions. Without the complete knowledge<br>
of such inclusions, quality control and process improvements can hardly be<br>
achieved. In order to achieve clean steel, steel producers have invested their<br>
major capital into metallurgical facilities. The process improvements made" due to<br>
installation of such facilities must be backed up by a reliable steel cleanliness<br>
evaluation technique.<br><br>
It is a common practice in most of the steel plants to measure Total Oxygen in<br>
steel samples as an indicator of cleanliness level in steel. However, in this<br>
technique very small quantity of sample is required which is not sufficient to<br>
assure the whole lot of heat. At the same time, sample preparation also takes a<br>
lot of time and corrective actions are delayed.<br>
Most of the total oxygen content in steel as measured by chemical methods is<br>
present in the form of non-metallic inclusions. The backscattered signals from<br>
these inclusions can be quantified in numbers and can be correlated with Total<br>
Oxygen content of steel. The present invention relates to correlations found<br>
using an ultrasonic technique using X' scan automatic immersion system with<br>
image analysis software to assess cleanliness level in continuously cast steel<br>
samples taken by a special sampler from liquid steel containers like<br>
ladles/tundishes/moulds etc.<br>
This technique provides larger volume inspection (compared with total oxygen<br>
and optical microscopic measurements to assess cleanliness in steel samples)<br>
and information about the steel defects like non-metallic inclusions/pores etc. in<br>
cast solidified samples taken from containers holding liquid steel using specific<br>
sampler.<br><br>
The back-scattered signals from non-metallic inclusions/pores etc. are displayed<br>
as echoes in 'A' scan with different amplitudes depending on their sizes and<br>
locations. A large number of 'A' scan data produces 'C scan display when the<br>
sample is scanned in both X and Y directions with specific incremental distances<br>
in these directions for capturing and storing them for further amplitude/image<br>
analysis with the help of an image analysis software.<br>
Good correlations were found between the counts of ultrasonic back scattered<br>
signals from non-metallic inclusions/pores etc of amplitudes beyond a threshold<br>
value and Total Oxygen content of steel during scanning the sample with specific<br>
incremental distances AX and AX equal to 0.2 mm. Using 15 mm diameter<br>
focused beam probe of frequencies 5 and 10 MHz, these correlations were<br>
developed. The correlations between ultrasonic counts and Total Oxygen were<br>
found to be better in case of 10 MHz frequency when compared with that of 5<br>
MHz frequency. These ultrasonic counts were found to be well correlated with<br>
the number of heats cast through BOF vessels, Sequence No. of heats poured<br>
into the Tundish and Feo+MnO content of the LF slag using 5 MHz focused beam<br>
probe.<br><br>
Presence of non-metallic inclusions / cracks, pin holes/blow holes, segregation<br>
etc.<br>
makes the continuously cast product inferior in quality. The sources of non-<br>
metallic inclusions in continuously cast steels are listed below :<br>
A.	Exogeneous Inclusions originate owing to the following reasons:<br>
•	Entrapment of slag<br>
•	Entrapment of mould powder<br>
•	Wear of ladle refractories etc.<br>
B.	Endogeneous Inclusions originate owing to the following reasons:<br>
•	Entrapment of deoxidation products<br>
•	Oxidation of metal stream if it is not shrouded<br>
Steel producers are making efforts continuously to improve the steel making<br>
processes in order to reduce these inclusions. The following processes are being<br>
adopted to achieve this objective in continuous casting of steel slabs.<br>
1. Secondary Metallurgy<br>
•	Tapping technique and ladle treatment<br>
•	RH (Ruhrsthat Heraeus) degassing and Ca treatment<br>
•	Titanium deoxidation<br><br>
2.	Tundish Metallurgy<br>
•	Tundish size, steel level and mode of operation<br>
•	Flow control devices in Tundish<br>
•	Start of casting and ladle change<br>
3.	Submerged Entry Nozzles (SEN) and Mould<br>
•	Flow of metal in mould<br>
•	SEN variants<br>
•	Electro Magnetic Breaks (EMBR)<br>
•	Sequence length<br>
4. Geometry of Continuous Slab Casters<br>
•	Influence of the vertical segment.<br>
The effectiveness of these process changes in order to improve the steel<br>
cleanliness should be measured very carefully. The following methods have<br>
been used to assess non-metallic inclusions and other flaws in CC steel:<br>
1.	Visual Inspection of Macro-etch<br>
2.	Sulphur Print Evaluation<br>
3.	Magnetic Particle Inspection<br><br>
4.	Dye Penetration Test<br>
5.	Total Oxygen Measurement<br>
6.	Insoluble Aluminium Analysis<br>
7.	Microscopic Evaluation<br>
8.	Radioactive labeling<br>
9.	Eddy Current<br>
10.	Ultrasonic Testing<br>
The methods 1 and 2 are the most common methods which are followed by<br>
many steel producers. These methods require consumption of chemicals (acids)<br>
which pollutes the environment with more hazardous fumes. Visual<br>
interpretations of the results are prone to human errors. Sulphur print<br>
evaluation and etching has problems with low sulphur heats. Moreover, the<br>
results of these two methods are confined to the XY plane only and through<br>
thickness volumetric information is missing.<br>
Methods 3, 4 and 9 are conventional NDT (Non Destructive Testing) methods<br>
which are again confined to surface/subsurface only. In method 8 hazardous<br>
radioactive elements need to be handled. The information generated through<br>
this process is limited to the surface.<br><br>
Methods 5 and 6 involve chemical analysis methods in which small size samples<br>
are taken from liquid steel. However, this method does not provide accurate<br>
information in the solidified steel (distribution and location wise).<br>
Microscopic evaluation methods examine a very small spot on the sample<br>
surface. This method is time consuming, tedious and requires a large number of<br>
samples for accurate judgment. Moreover, chances of missing macro-inclusions<br>
are high. These are more detrimental than micro-inclusions. The inclusions<br>
generally detected in this case are in micro levels.<br>
Many steel plants follow Mannesman Inclusion Detection 'MIDAS' method for<br>
quantifying macro-inclusions using ultrasonic 'C scan immersion technique. This<br>
method needs special cross hot rolling of the samples cut from the cast slabs.<br>
Sample preparation takes a lot of time and the results are delayed.<br>
The present invention is mainly focused on developing a method using ultrasonic<br>
"C scan image analysis for correlating counts of ultrasonic back scattered signals<br>
from non-metallic inclusions/pores etc having amplitudes beyond a threshold<br>
value with Total Oxygen content of steel. Unlike 'MIDAS' method, steel samples<br><br>
are the cast samples taken from the Ladles/Tundishes/Moulds containing liquid<br>
steel. These samples need not require rolling or forging and can be prepared<br>
within short time; only cutting, grinding or polishing is required with both flat<br>
surfaces parallel. Some good correlations have also been shown between<br>
ultrasonic counts and (Feo+Mno) in slag; ultrasonic counts and Seq. No. of Heats<br>
in Tundish etc.<br>
OBJECTIVE OF THE INVENTION<br>
Objective of the invention are:<br>
•	To develop an improved method of assessing cleanliness level in steel<br>
(particularly macro-inclusions) using Ultrasonic 'C scan image analysis<br>
software.<br>
•	To find correlation between the ultrasonic parameter (ultrasonic counts)<br>
using computer controlled Automatic 'C' Scan Immersion and Image<br>
Analysis System and Total Oxygen content of steel, thus replacing Total<br>
Oxygen measurement in steel samples as a measure of steel cleanliness<br>
on obtaining good correlation between ultrasonic counts.<br><br>
•	To develop an improved method of assessing cleanliness level in steel<br>
(particularly macro-inclusions) using 'Ultrasonic 'C' scan image analysis<br>
software.<br>
•	To find correlation between the ultrasonic parameter (ultrasonic counts)<br>
using computer controlled Automatic 'C' Scan Immersion and Image<br>
Analysis System and the factors responsible for making steel dirty like,<br>
Seq.no. of heats in tundish, No. of heats poured in Tundish and FeO+MnO<br>
in slag etc. so that corrective actions can be taken to improve cleanliness<br>
level in steel.<br>
•	To ensure cleanliness level in larger volume of steel at faster speed with<br>
quick corrective actions.<br>
•	To replace Slime Extraction method of macro-inclusion detection and<br>
measurement in steel, followed in some steel plants which is a very long<br>
time taking process.<br>
•	To help operational people to reduce non-metallic inclusions in "steel and<br>
hence reduction in some of the rolling defects like slivers in auto grade of<br>
steels like IF grade and wire breakages during wire drawing to very thin<br>
cross sections due to presence of macro-inclusions.<br><br>
• To ensure the products sent to the customers free from harmful<br>
macroinclusions which may cause further processing problems at their<br>
end.<br>
The present invention has overcome the drawbacks of earlier methods for<br>
cleanliness assessment in steel samples. The special features of the proposed<br>
invention are quick and large volume inspection and ability to catch macro-<br>
inclusions which are really troublesome in further processing of the thin gauge<br>
products.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
25 mm diameter and 100 mm long cylindrical steel cast samples were taken by a<br>
special sampler device by plunging it deeper (approx. 300 mm below the liquid<br>
steel surface) into the liquid steel from Ladle Furnace as well as from Tundish.<br>
25 mm dia. and 15.0 mm thick samples were cut from these samples and were<br>
ground with mirror finish to thickness 14.8 mm and parallel faces on which<br>
ultrasonic measurements were made. The ultrasonic scanning using 5 MHz &amp; 10<br>
MHz focused beam probe (with 38.1 mm focal length in water) was done on the<br>
mirror finish face with incremental distances AX = AY = 0.2 mm. Water path for<br>
testing the sample was calculated using relation:<br><br>
where,<br>
Sw = Water path,<br>
Sf = Focal distance in water,<br><br>
Sm = Sound path in test material,<br>
Cw = Sound velocity in water,<br>
Cm = Sound velocity in test material<br>

Instrument's Labview.<br>
Results of 5 MHz, 15 mm dia. focused beam probe :<br>
Total ultrasonic counts in all the samples were measured considering the various<br>
backscattered signal amplitudes on arbitrary scale and various pixel sizes in grey<br>
mode presentation of the C- Scan image.<br><br>
1. As shown in Fig.2, Ultrasonic counts of amplitudes 0.40-0.50 (a.u) Vs Total<br>
Oxygen graph plot reveals a second order polynomial equation y = - 1.0121x2 +<br>
80.532x - 994.94 where x and y are Total Oxygen in ppm and ultrasonic counts<br>
respectively. Correlation coefficient was found to be R2 = 0.5705.<br>
2.	As shown in Fig.3, Ultrasonic counts Vs (FeO+MnO) in slag graph plot reveals<br>
a trend line equation y = 2 E - 06 X 6752 where x and y are (FeO+MnO) in<br>
slag and ultrasonic counts respectively. Correlation coefficient was found to<br>
be R2 =0.7103. Ultrasonic counts were the numbers of backscattered signals<br>
from the inclusions with areas 0.04-0.44 mm2 (as measured from the pixels).<br>
3.	As shown in Fig.4, Ultrasonic counts Vs No. of heats poured in tundish graph<br>
plot reveals a second order polynomial equation y = -11.8 X2+ 111.98x - 69.408,<br>
where x and y are No. of heats in tundish and ultrasonic counts respectively.<br>
Correlation coefficient was found to be R2 =0.8769. Ultrasonic counts were<br>
measured in the same manner as mentioned in point 2.<br><br>
4. As shown in Fig.5, Ultrasonic counts Vs Sequence no. of heats in tundish<br>
graph plot reveals a trend line equation y = 2E-32 X 20-768, where x and y are<br>
No. of heats in tundish and ultrasonic counts respectively. Correlation<br>
coefficient was found to be R2 = 0.903. Ultrasonic counts were measured in<br>
the same manner as mentioned in point 2<br>
Results of 10 MHz, 15 mm dia. Focused beam probe :<br>
The same samples were tested with 10 MHz focused beam probe. In this case,<br>
ultrasonic backscattered signal amplitudes were arbitrarily cateqorized in 3<br>
levels; 1.1-1.2 level-1, 0.55-0.65 level-2 and 0.40-0.50 level-3. The results are as<br>
given below:<br>
1. As shown in Fig.6, Ultrasonic counts level-1 Vs Total Oxygen graph plot<br>
reveals a second order polynomial y = -0.6763 X2 + 59.624 X - 671.91 where<br>
x and y are Total Oxygen in ppm and ultrasonic counts level-1 respectively.<br>
Correlation coefficient was found to be R2 =0.9464.<br><br>
2.	As shown in Fig.7, Ultrasonic counts level-2 Vs Total Oxygen graph plot<br>
reveals a second order polynomial y = -1.8228 X2 + 156.88 x - 2702 where x<br>
and y are Total Oxygen in ppm and ultrasonic counts level-2 respectively.<br>
Correlation coefficient was found to be R2 =0.8568.<br>
3.	As shown in Fig.8, Ultrasonic counts level-3 Vs Total Oxygen graph plot<br>
reveals a second order polynomial y = -1.1333 X2 + 87.791 x - 1239.1, where x<br>
and y are Total Oxygen in ppm and ultrasonic counts level-3 respectively.<br>
Correlation coefficient was found to be R2= 0.2768.<br><br>
4.	As shown in Fig.9, Ultrasonic total counts (level-l+ level-2+ level-3) Vs Total<br>
Oxygen graph plot reveals a second order polynomial y = -3.6325 X 2 + 304.29 x<br>
- 4613 where x and y are Total Oxygen in ppm and ultrasonic total counts<br>
respectively. Correlation coefficient was found to be R2 = 0.8932.<br>
5.	As shown in Fig. 10 -12, the bar chart shows decrease in ultrasonic counts with<br>
decrease in total oxygen content of the samples 8075, 8074 and 8073. The<br>
trend was same for both samples taken at RH as well as at caster.<br><br>
6.	Fig. 13 shows the variation in defect/inclusion size distribution in caster<br>
samples as well as RH degassed samples. On arbitrary scale coarse, medium<br>
and fine size defects/inclusions were of 1-3, 3-5 and 5-7 pixel sizes<br>
respectively in ultrasonic C scan image plot.<br>
7.	Fig.14-19 illustrates ultrasonic C scan images indicating increase in ultrasonic<br>
counts with increase in no. of Heats made in BOF Vessel, Seq. No. in tundish,<br>
No. of Heats poured in tundish, FeO+MnO in slag and Total Oxygen in LF and<br>
Caster samples.<br>
Inclusion severity levels and size analysis results using 5 MHz focused<br>
beam probe:<br>
Inclusion severity levels were categorized into 8 levels according to the<br>
amplitudes of the backscattered signals e.g. Level-1( 0.2-0.4), Level-2 (0.4-0.5),<br>
Level-3 (0.55-0.65), Level-4 (0.75-0.85), Level-5 (0.85-0.95), Level-6 (1.0-1.2),<br>
