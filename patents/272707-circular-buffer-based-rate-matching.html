CIRCULAR BUFFER BASED RATE MATCfflNG<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001]	This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent application<br>
Serial No. 60/908,402 entitled "A METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR CIRCULAR BUFFER BASED RATE MATCHING" which was filed March 27, 2007. The entirety of the aforementioned application is herein incorporated by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
I.	Field<br>
[0002]	The following description relates generally to wireless communications,<br>
and more particularly to utilizing circular buffer based rate matching for transferring data in a wireless communication system.<br>
II.	Bach^round<br>
[0003]	Wireless communication systems are widely deployed to provide various<br>
types of communication; for instance, voice and/or data can be provided via such wireless communication systems. A typical wireless communication system, or network, can provide multiple users access to one or more shared resources (e.g., bandwidth, transmit power, ...). For instance, a system can use a variety of multiple access techniques such as Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM), Time Division Multiplexing (TDM), Code Division Multiplexing (CDM), Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), and others.<br>
[0004]	Generally,   wireless   multiple-access   communication   systems   can<br>
simultaneously support communication for multiple access terminals. Each access terminal can communicate with one or more base stations via transmissions on forward and reverse links. The forward link (or downlink) refers to the communication link fi-om base stations to access terminals, and the reverse link (or uplink) refers to the communication link fi-om access terminals to base stations. This communication link can be established via a single-in-single-out, multiple-in-single-out or a multiple-in-multiple-out (MIMO) system.<br><br>
071243<br>
[0005]	Wireless communication systems oftentimes employ one or more base<br>
stations that provide a coverage area. A typical base station can transmit multiple data streams for broadcast, multicast and/or unicast services, wherein a data stream may be a stream of data that can be of independent reception interest to an access terminal. An access terminal within the coverage area of such base station can be employed to receive one, more than one, or all the data streams carried by the composite stream. Likewise, an access terminal can transmit data to the base station or another access terminal.<br>
[0006]	Recently, turbo code, which is a high performance error correction code,<br>
has been developed to enhance data transfer over limited-bandwidth communication<br>
links in the presence of data corrupting noise. The turbo code can be utilized by any<br>
wireless communication apparatus (e.g., base station, access terminal, ...) for encoding<br>
data to be transmitted by that respective wireless communication apparatus. A turbo<br>
code encoder can integrate parity bits vnih systematic bits (e.g., payload data, ...),<br>
which increases an overall number of bits to be transmitted by the wireless<br>
communication apparatus (e.g., if X bits are inputted to the turbo code encoder, then<br>
approximately 3X bits can be outputted from the turbo code encoder).<br>
[0007]	The overall number of coded bits outputted from the turbo code encoder<br>
to be transported over a channel, however, can differ from a number of bits that the wireless communication apparatus is able to send upon the channel (e.g., the number of bits that the wireless communication apparatus is able to send can be a fimction of an assignment, a property or characteristic of the wireless communication apparatus and/or a wireless communication environment in general, ...). For instance, the wireless communication apparatus may be unable to transport all of the coded bits since the number of coded bits can exceed the number of bits that the wireless communication apparatus is able to send upon the channel. Pursuant to another illustration, the number of coded bits can be less than the number of bits that the wireless communication apparatus is able to send upon the channel. Thus, rate matching can be performed to alter the number of coded bits to be sent over the channel to match the number of bits that the wireless cominunication apparatus is able to send upon the channel; more particularly, rate matching can puncture bits (e.g., delete bits) to decrease the rate (e.g., when the number of coded bits is greater than the number of bits that can be sent upon the channel) or repeat bits to increase the rate (e.g., when the number of coded bits is<br><br>
071243<br>
less than the number of bits that can be sent upon the channel). By way of example, when the number of coded bits is approximately 3X bits (e.g., based upon X bits being inputted to the turbo code encoder) and the approximately 3X bits exceeds the number of bits that can be sent upon the channel, then fewer than 3X bits can be transmitted from the wireless communication apparatus upon performing rate matching. Conventional rate matching techniques (e.g., such as rate matching in R99, R5, R6, ...), however, can be complicated and primarily intended for transport channel multiplexing. For instance, these common rate matching techniques can involve several complicated stages of puncturing or repetition and bit-collection algorithms.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0008]	The   following   presents   a   simplified   summary   of  one   or   more<br>
embodiments in order to provide a basic understanding of such embodiments. This summary is not an extensive overview of all contemplated embodiments, and is intended to neither identify key or critical elements of all embodiments nor delineate the scope of any or all embodiments. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts of one or more embodiments in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.<br>
[0009]	In accordance with one or more embodiments and corresponding<br>
disclosure thereof, various aspects are described in connection with facilitating employment of circular buffer based rate matching. Encoded block(s) that include systematic, parity 1, and parity 2 bits can be generated using turbo code. Bit type can be identified to separate bits into distinct groups. Systematic bits can be interleaved together to generate a randomized sequence of systematic bits, parity 1 bits can be interleaved together to yield a randomized sequence of parity 1 bits, and parity 2 bits can be interleaved together to output a randomized sequence of parity 2 bits.

The randomized sequence of systematic bits can be inserted into a circular buffer, and upon inserting the entire sequence, the interlaced parity bits can be inserted into the circular buffer (e.g., until reaching capacity). Bits inserted into the circular buffer are transmitted.<br>
[0010]	According to related aspects, a method that facilitates rate matching in a<br>
wireless communication environment is described herein.   The method can include<br><br>
071243<br>

Additionally, the method can comprise transmitting the bits inserted into the circular buffer.<br>
[0011]	Another aspect relates to a wireless communications apparatus.   The<br>

Further, the wireless communications apparatus can include a processor, coupled to the memory, configured to execute the instructions retained in the memory.<br>
[0012]	Yet another aspect relates to a wireless communications apparatus that<br>
enables employing rate matching in a wireless communication environment. The wireless communications apparatus can include means for interleaving systematic bits collected from at least one encoded block outputted by an encoder. Further, the v^reless communications apparatus can include means for interleaving parity 1 bits collected from the at least one encoded block. Moreover, the wireless communications apparatus can comprise means for interleaving parity 2 bits collected from the at least one encoded block. Additionally, the wireless communications apparatus can include means for interlacing the interleaved parity 1 bits and the interleaved parity 2 bits.<br><br>
071243<br>
[0013]	Still another aspect relates to a machine-readable medium having stored<br>
thereon machine-executable instructions for identifying systematic bits, parity 1 bits, and parity 2 bits from at least one encoded block outputted by an encoder; assembling the identified systematic bits in a first collection, the identified parity 2 bits in a second collection and the identified parity 2 bits in a third collection; interleaving the collected systematic bits together to generate a randomized sequence of systematic bits; interleaving the collected parity 1 bits together to generate a randomized sequence of parity 1 bits; interleaving the collected parity 2 bits together to generate a randomized sequence of parity 2 bits; interlacing the randomized sequence of parity 1 bits and the randomized sequence of parity 2 bits in an alternating manner to yield an interlaced sequence of parity 1 and 2 bits; inserting the randomized sequence of systematic bits into a circular buffer foUov^ed by the interlaced sequence of parity 1 and 2 bits; and transmitting the bits inserted into the circular buffer.<br>
[0014]	In   accordance   with   another   aspect,   an   apparatus   in   a   wireless<br>
communication system can include a processor, wherein the processor can be configured to segregate systematic bits, parity 1 bits, and parity 2 bits into distinct groups. Further, the processor can be configured to interleave the systematic bits, the parity 1 bits, and the parity 2 bits within the respective, distinct groups. Moreover, the processor can be configured to interlace the interleaved parity 1 bits with the interleaved parity 2 bits. The processor can additionally be configured to insert the interleaved systematic bits into a circular buffer followed by the interlaced and interleaved parity 1 and parity 2 bits. Also, the processor can be configured to transmit the bits inserted into the circular buffer.<br>

The term "article of manufacture" as used herein is intended to encompass a computer program accessible from any computer-readable device, carrier, or media. For example, computer-readable media can include but are not limited to magnetic storage devices (e.g., hard disk, floppy disk, magnetic<br><br>
071243<br>
strips, etc.), optical disks {e.g., compact disk (CD), digital versatile disk (DVD), etc.),<br>

Additionally, various storage media described herein can represent one or more devices<br>
and/or other machine-readable media for storing information. The term "machine-<br>
readable mediiim" can include, without being limited to, wireless channels and various<br>
other media capable of storing, containing, and/or carrying instruction(s) and/or data.<br>
[0030]	Referring now to Fig.  1, a wireless communication system  100 is<br>
illustrated in accordance with various embodiments presented herein. System 100 comprises a base station 102 that can include multiple antenna groups. For example, one antenna group can include antennas 104 and 106, another group can comprise antennas 108 and 110, and an additional group can include antennas 112 and 114. Two antennas are illustrated for each antenna group; however, more or fewer anteimas can be utilized for each group. Base station 102 can additionally include a transmitter chain and a receiver chain, each of which can in turn comprise a plurality of components associated with signal transmission and reception (e.g., processors, modulators, multiplexers, demodulators, demultiplexers, antennas, etc.), as will be appreciated by one skilled in the art.<br>
[0031]	Base station 102 can communicate with one or more access terminals<br>
such as access terminal 146 and access terminal 122; however, it is to be appreciated that base station 102 can communicate with substantially any number of access terminals similar to access terminals 116 and 122. Access terminals 116 and 122 can be, for example, cellular phones, smart phones, laptops, handheld conmiunication devices, handheld computing devices, satellite radios, global positioning systems, PDAs, and/or any other suitable device for communicating over wireless communication system 100. As depicted, access terminal 116 is in communication with antennas 112 and 114, where antennas 112 and 114 transmit information to access terminal 116 over a forward link 118 and receive information from access terminal 116 over a reverse link 120. Moreover, access terminal 122 is in communication with antennas 104 and 106, where antennas 104 and 106 transmit information to access terminal 122 over a forward link 124 and receive information from access terminal 122 over a reverse link 126. In a frequency division duplex (FDD) system, forward link 118 can utilize a different frequency band than that used by reverse link 120, and forward link 124 can employ a different frequency band than that employed by reverse link 126,<br><br>
071243<br>
for example. Further, in a time division duplex (TDD) system, forward link 118 and reverse link 120 can utilize a common frequency band and forward link 124 and reverse link 126 can utilize a common frequency band.<br>
[0032] ,	Each group of antennas and/or the area in which they are designated to<br>
communicate can be referred to as a sector of base station 102. For example, antenna groups can be designed to communicate to access terminals in a sector of the areas covered by base station 102. In communication over forward links 118 and 124, the transmitting antennas of base station 102 can utilize beamforming to improve signal-to-noise ratio of forward links 118 and 124 for access terminals 116 and 122. Also, while base station 102 utilizes beamforming to transmit to access terminals 116 and 122 scattered randomly through an associated coverage, access terminals in neighboring cells can be subject to less interference as compared to a base station transmitting through a single anterma to all its access terminals.<br>
[0033]	Base station 102, access terminal 116, and/or access terminal 122 can be<br>
a transmitting wireless communication apparatus and/or a receiving wireless<br>
communication apparatus at a given time. When sending data, the transmitting wireless<br>
communication apparatus can encode data for transfer. More particularly, the<br>
transmitting wireless communication apparatus can have (e.g., generate, obtain, retain in<br>
memory, ...) a certain number of information bits to be sent over a channel to the<br>
receiving wireless communication apparatus. Such information bits can be included in a<br>
transport block of data (or a plurality of transport blocks) that can be segmented to yield<br>
a plurality of code blocks. Further, each of the code blocks can be encoded by the<br>
transmitting wireless communication apparatus using a turbo code encoder (not shown).<br>
The turbo code encoder can output an encoded block for each of the code blocks<br>
inputted thereto. The encoded blocks outputted by the turbo code encoder can each<br>
include three elements: systematic bits, parity 1 bits, and parity 2 bits.<br>
[0034]	The  transmitting wireless  communication apparatus  can  employ  a<br>
circular buffer based rate matching algorithm that allows for simplification as compared to conventional techniques (e.g., even in the presence of multiple code blocks and transport blocks). More particularly, circular buffer based rate matching can be effectuated by the transmitting wireless communication apparatus collecting systematic bits of all encoded blocks yielded from a transport block. Further, the collected systematic bits can be interleaved together to yield a first set of bits for sending over a<br><br>
071243<br>
10<br>
channel. Moreover, the parity 1 bits and the parity 2 bits of all encoded blocks yielded from the transport block can be collected. Upon being collected, the parity 1 bits can be interleaved together. Also, upon being collected, the parity 2 bits can be interleaved together. Thereafter, the interleaved parity 1 bits and the interleaved parity 2 bits can be interlaced together in an alternating manner to yield a second set of bits for sending over the channel. The first and second set of bits can be mapped to wrap around a circular buffer; however, the claimed subject matter is not so limited as use of any type of mapping is contemplated. The transmitting wireless communication apparatus can then transmit bits from the first set {e.g., the systematic bits) over the channel. After transmission of the first set of bits, the transmitting wireless communication apparatus can transmit bits fi:om the second set over the channel.<br>
[0035]	By separating the systematic bits fi-om the parity 1 and parity 2 bits,<br>
circular buffer based rate matching allows for transferring systematic bits prior to<br>
transmitting parity bits. Thus, under high code rate conditions where a large number of<br>
systematic bits are to be transmitted in a given time period, circular buffer based rate<br>
matching can yield improved performance as compared to conventional techniques<br>
(e.g., R99 rate matching, R5 rate matching, R6 rate matching, ...), while performance<br>
can be similar for circular buffer based rate matching and conventional rate matching<br>
techniques under low code rate conditions. More particularly, under high code rate<br>
conditions, the transmitting wireless communication apparatus may be unable to<br>
transmit all bits of the encoded blocks. Thus, puncturing (e.g., deleting) of bits can be<br>
performed for rate matching purposes to reduce the number of bits for communication.<br>
In association with puncturing of bits, the transmitting wireless communication<br>
apparatus preferentially selects systematic bits for transmission; thus, if possible, all<br>
systematic bits from the encoded blocks are transferred via the channel, and if additional<br>
bits can be transmitted, then a subset of parity 1 and parity 2 bits are transmitted upon<br>
the channel. Further, when a low code rate is utilized, all systematic bits and all parity 1<br>
and parity 2 bits fi-om the encoded blocks can be transferred upon the channel.<br>
[0036]	Now turning to Fig. 2, illustrated is a system 200 that performs rate<br>
matching utilizing a circular buffer based algorithm in a wireless communication environment. System 200 includes a wireless communication apparatus 202 that is shown to be transmitting data via a chaimel. Although depicted as transmitting data, wireless communication apparatus 202 can also receive data via the channel (e.g.,<br><br>
071243<br>
11<br>
wireless communication apparatus 202 can concurrent transmit and receive data,<br>
wireless communication apparatus 202 can transmit and receive data at differing times,<br>
a combination thereof, ...)• Wireless communication apparatus 202, for instance, can be<br>
a base station (e.g., base station 102 of Fig. 1, ...), an access terminal (e.g., access<br>
terminal 116 of Fig. 1, access terminal 122 of Fig. 1,...), or the like.<br>
[0037]	Wireless communication apparatus 202 can include a turbo code encoder<br>
204 (e.g., encoder, ...) that encodes data to be transferred from wireless communication apparatus 202. Turbo code encoder 204 utilizes a high-performance error correction code to optimize information transfer over a limited-bandwidth cormection link in the presence of data-corrupting noise. The input to the turbo code encoder 204 can be one or more code blocks. For example, a transport block can be segmented into M code blocks (e.g., code block 0, code block 1, ..., code block M-1), where M can be substantially any integer, and these M code blocks can be utilized as input to turbo code encoder 204. Turbo code encoder 204 can output M encoded blocks (e.g., encoded block 0, encoded block 1, ..., encoded block M-1) based upon the M code blocks inputted thereto. Further, each of the M encoded blocks outputted by turbo code encoder 204 can correspond to a respective inputted one of the M code blocks (e.g., encoded block 0 can be generated based upon code block 0, encoded block 1 can be yielded based upon code block 1, ..., encoded block M-1 can be generated based upon code block M-1).<br>
[0038]	The M encoded blocks outputted by turbo code encoder 204 can each<br>
include three elements: systematic bits, parity 1 bits, and parity 2 bits. The following provides an example pertaining to one of the M encoded blocks, and it is to be appreciated that the other encoded blocks can be substantially similar. Systematic bits of the encoded block can include payload data. Parity 1 bits of the encoded block can comprise parity bits for the payload data; these parity bits can be generated by turbo code encoder 204 employing a recursive systematic convolution code (RSC code). Further, parity 2 bits of the encoded block can include parity bits for a known permutation of the payload data; these parity bits can be yielded by turbo code encoder 204 using an RSC code.<br>
[0039]	The turbo code utilized by turbo code encoder 204 can be a 1/3 turbo<br>
encoding fiinction. Thus, an input of X bits (e.g., X bits included in the M code blocks) to turbo code encoder 204 can yield approximately 3X bits as an output (e.g..<br><br>
071243<br>
12<br>
approximately 3X bits in the M encoded blocks, 3X+12 bits, ...).   However, wireless<br>
communication apparatus 202 may be unable to send these 3X bits over the channel.<br>
Thus, wireless communication apparatus 202 can employ rate matching to convert firom<br>
these 3X bits down to a lesser number of bits for transfer via the channel.<br>
[0040]	It is contemplated that turbo code encoder 204 can obtain any number of<br>
code blocks as input. For instance, a greater number of code blocks can yield a larger stream of systematic bits, a larger stream of parity 1 bits, and a larger stream of parity 2 bits. Regardless of the size of each of these streams outputted fi-om turbo code encoder 204, wireless communication apparatus 202 can process this output pursuant to the following.<br>
[0041]	Wireless communication apparatus 202 can further include a bit type<br>
separator 206 that divides bits outputted by turbo code encoder 204 into disparate collections. Bit type separator 206 can recognize a type of each of the bits outputted by turbo code encoder 204; thus, bit type separator 206 can determine whether a bit is a systematic bit, a parity 1 bit, or a parity 2 bit. For example, bit type separator 206 can utilize a priori knowledge of operation of turbo code encoder 204 to decipher a type of each of the bits; following this example, turbo code encoder 204 can output systematic bits, parity 1 bits, and parity 2 bits in a predetermined order that can be known by bit type separator 206. Thus, bit type separator 206 can leverage such knowledge to identify systematic bits, parity 1 bits, and parity 2 bits. Upon identifying bit type, bit type separator 206 can collect systematic bits in a first group, parity 1 bits in a second group, and parity 2 bits in a third group.<br>
[0042]	Moreover,   wireless  communication  apparatus  202  can  include  an<br>
interleaver 208 that interleaves bits for transmission. Interleaver 208 can randomly arrange bits that are interleaved together; thus, Y bits inputted to interleaver 208 in a first sequence can be outputted by interleaver 208 as a randomized, second sequence of the Y bits, where Y can be any integer. For instance, interleaving can protect a transmission again burst errors. By way of illustration, interleaver 208 can be a Quadratic Permutation Polynomial (QPP) Interleaver; however, the claimed subject matter is not so limited. The systematic bits collected in the first group by bit type separator 206 can be interleaved together by interleaver 208 to arrange such bits in a non-contiguous manner. The interleaved systematic bits in the randomized sequence can be denoted as a first set of bits for transmission over a channel. Interleaver 208 can<br><br>
071243<br>
13<br>
also interleave together parity 1 bits assembled in the second group by bit type separator 206. Further, interleaver 208 can interleave together parity 2 bits collected in the third group by bit type separator 206. Although one interleaver 208 is depicted, it is contemplated that wireless communication apparatus 202 can include more than one interleaver, each of which can be substantially similar to interleaver 208 {e.g., one interleaver can interleave systematic bits while a second interleaver can interleave parity 1 bits and parity 2 bits, a first interleaver can interleave systematic bits, a second interleaver can interleave parity 1 bits, and a third interleaver can interleave parity 2 bits, ...).<br>
[0043]	Wireless communication apparatus 202 can also include an interlacer 210<br>
that interlaces the interleaved parity 1 bits with the interleaved parity 2 bits. Interlacer 210 can create a second set of bits for transmission over the channel from the interleaved parity 1 bits and the interleaved parity 2 bits. Interlacer 210 organizes the interleaved parity 1 bits and the interleaved parity 2 bits according to a specific ordering; namely, interlacer 210 can alternate between interleaved parity 1 bits and interleaved parity 2 bits. Thus, the output (e.g., the second set of bits for transmission over the chaimel) from interlacer 210 can be a sequence that alternates between an interleaved parity 1 bit and an interleaved parity 2 bit (e.g., every other bit is a parity 1 bit, every other bit is a parity 2 bit, ...). Utilization of interlacer 210 causes parity bits outputted by turbo code encoder 204 to be treated differently as compared to systematic bits outputted by turbo code encoder 204.<br>
[0044]	Wireless  communication apparatus 202  can additionally  include a<br>
mapper 212 and a transmitter 214. Mapper 212 can insert the first set of bits for transmission yielded by interleaver 208 and the second set of bits for transmission outputted by interlacer 210 into a circular buffer. For instance, the circular buffer can be a fixed size buffer. Thus, mapper 212 can first wrap bits from the first set (e.g., interleaved systematic bits) arovmd the circular buffer. Thereafter, mapper 212 can wrap bits from the second set (e.g., interleaved parity 1 bits and interleaved parity 2 bits interlaced in an alternating fashion) around the circular buffer. Although use of a circular buffer is described, it is to be appreciated that mapper 212 can employ any mapping of bits in the first set and the second set. Further, transmitter 214 can thereafter transfer bits in circular buffer over the channel.   Transmitter 214 can, for<br><br>
071243<br>
14<br>
example, transmit the bits in the circular buffer (or in any other mapping utilized by<br>
mapper 212) to a disparate wireless communication apparatus (not shown).<br>
[0045]	The circular buffer based rate matching described herein can involve<br>
using one interleaver during Hybrid Automatic Repeat-Request (HARQ) bit insertion<br>
into the buffer (e.g., for Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA)).   In<br>
contrast, conventional rate matching techniques oftentimes use an additional channel<br>
interleaver, which can increase complexity associated with such techniques.<br>
[0046]	The following example is provided for illustration purposes, and it is to<br>
be appreciated that the claimed subject matter is not so limited. According to this example, wireless communication apparatus 202 can input 1000 bits (e.g., from code blocks 0 to M-1, ...) to turbo code encoder 204. Turbo code encoder 204 can process the 1000 bits and output approximately 3000 bits. The 3000 bits can include 1000 systematic bits, 1000 parity 1 bits, and 1000 parity 2 bits. Bit type separator 206 can identify a type of each of the 3000 bits and group the 1000 systematic bits, the 1000 parity 1 bits, and the 1000 parity 2 bits into separat? collections. Moreover, interleaver 208 can randomly interleave the 1000 systematic bits together to yield a first set of bits for transmission. Further, interleaver 208 can randomly interleave the 1000 parity 1 bits together. Additionally, interleaver 208 can randomly interleave the 1000 parity 2 bits together. Thereafter, interlacer 210 can combine the randomly interleaved 1000 parity 1 bits and the randomly interleaved 1000 parity 2 bits in an alternating manner (e.g., parity 1 bit, parity 2 bit, parity 1 bit, parity 2 bit, ...) to generate a second set of bits for transmission, where the second set of bits includes 2000 bits. Moreover, mapper 212 can insert bits into a circular buffer. According to an example, 2000 bits can be transmitted by wireless communication apparatus 202 (e.g., 2000 bits can be inserted into the circular buffer). Thus, mapper 212 can insert the 1000 interleaved systematic bits from the first set into the circular buffer (e.g., mapper 212 can start at a particular location of the circular buffer and clockwise (or counterclockwise) add the sequence of 1000 interleaved systematic bits, ...). Additionally, mapper 212 can insert a first 1000 bits from the 2000 bits included in the second set into the circular buffer (e.g., mapper 212 can continue adding the sequence of 1000 parity bits to the circular buffer in a similar manner from an end of the sequence of interleaved systematic bits, ...); hence, the remaining 1000 bits need not be inserted into the circular buffer by mapper 212 (e.g., since the circular buffer can be frill).  Further, fransmitter 214 can send the 2000<br><br>
071243<br>
15<br>
bits included in the circular buffer over the channel. By utilizing system 200, the 1000 systematic bits can all be transferred by transmitter 214 since the systematic bits can be preferentially treated as compared to the parity bits (e.g., systematic bits can be considered to be more important than parity bits). Moreover, 500 parity 1 bits and 500 parity 2 bits can be transferred with the remaining resources (e.g., equal weighting can be provided for both parity 1 bits and parity 2 bits, ...). Although the aforementioned describes utilization of equal weighting for parity 1 bits and parity 2 bits, it is to be appreciated that any xmequal weighting between parity 1 bits and parity 2 bits can be employed.<br>
[0047]	Moreover,  system  200  supports  sending multiple  transport blocks.<br>
Accordingly, if multiple transport blocks are present, rate matching can be done on a per transport block basis.<br>
[0048]	Referring to  Fig.  3,  illustrated  is  an example  schematic  300  for<br>
employing a circular buffer based rate matching algorithm. At 302, a transport block can be inputted. The transport block can be segmented into M code blocks (e.g., code block 0 304, code block 1 306, ..., code block M-1 308), where M can be any integer. The M code blocks can be inputted to turbo coder 310 to yield M encoded blocks (e.g., encoded block 0 312, encoded block 1 314, ..., encoded block M-1 316). Each of the encoded blocks 312-316 can be generated as a function of a respective one of the code blocks 304-308. Each of the encoded blocks 312-316 yielded from the turbo coder 310 can include systematic bits, parity 1 bits, and parity 2 bits. According, encoded block 0 312 can include systematic bits 0 318, parity 1 bits 0 320, and parity 2 bits 0 322, encoded block 1 314 can include systematic bits 1 324, parity 1 bits 1 326, and parity 2 bits 1 328, ..., and encoded block M-1 316 can include systematic bits M-1 330, parity 1 bits M-1 332, and parity 2 bits M-1 334.<br>
[0049]	Thereafter, each type of bits can be identified and grouped.    Thus,<br>
systematic bits 0 318, systematic bits 1 324, ..., systematic bits M-1 330 can be recognized as systematic bits and assembled into a first group. Parity 1 bits 0 320, parity 1 bits 1 326, ..., parity 1 bits M-1 332 can be identified as parity 1 bits and collected into a second group. Moreover, parity 2 bits 0 322, parity 2 bits 1 328,..., and parity 2 bits M-1 334 can be recognized as parity 2 bits and assembled into a third group.<br><br>
071243<br>
16<br>
[0050]	Systematic bits 318, 324, and 330 can be inputted to an interleaver 336 to<br>
randomize a sequence thereof Further, parity 1 bits 320, 326, and 332 can be inputted to an interleaver 338 to randomize a sequence thereof Moreover, parity 2 bits 322, 328, and 334 can be inputted to an interleaver 340 to randomize a sequence thereof As shown, separate interleavers 336, 338, and 340 can be utilized for systematic bits 318, 324, and 330, parity 1 bits 320, 326, and 332, and parity 2 bits 322, 328, and 334. According to another illustration (not shown), a common interleaver can be employed for systematic bits 318, 324, and 330, parity 1 bits 320, 326, and 332, and parity 2 bits 322, 328, and 334. Pursuant to a fiuther example, interleaver 336 can interleave systematic bits 318, 324, and 330, while a disparate interleaver (not shown) can interleave parity 1 bits 320, 326, and 332 together and can interleave parity 2 bits 322, 328, and 334 together (e.g., interleaving of parity 1 bits and parity 2 bits can be separate from each other).<br>
[0051]	The output of interleaver 336 can be the randomized sequence of<br>
systematic bits 342. Moreover, the output of interleavers 338 and 340 can be interlaced together in an alternating manner to yield a sequence of parity 1 and 2 bits 344. The sequence of systematic bits 342 and the sequence of parity 1 and 2 bits 344 can thereafter be inserted into a circular buffer 346. For example, the sequence of systematic bits 342 can first be inserted into the circular buffer 346, and the sequence of parity 1 and 2 bits 344 can thereafter be inserted into the circular buffer 346 utilizing any remaining space. Thus, filling of the circular buffer 346 can begin at a particular location with the sequence of systematic bits 342 and proceed clockwise (or counterclockwise) to fill a first section 348 of the circular buffer 346. If the sequence of systematic bits 342 is able to be inserted completely into the circular buffer 346, then the sequence of parity 1 and 2 bits 344 can begin to be inserted in remaining sections 350 and 352 of the circular buffer 346. Although shown as being separate fi-om each other, it is contemplated that sections 350 and 352 can be substantially similar to each other and/or can be combined into one common section (not shown) of the circular buffer 346. The sequence of parity 1 and 2 bits 344 can continue to be inserted around the circular buffer 346 until the end of such sequence 344 is reached or the buffer 346 has no available space remaining.<br>
[0052]	Referring to Figs. 4-6, methodologies relating to effectuating circular<br>
buffer based rate matching in a wireless communication environment are illustrated.<br><br>
071243<br>
17<br>
While, for purposes of simplicity of explanation, the methodologies are shown and described as a series of acts, it is to be understood and appreciated that the methodologies are not limited by the order of acts, as some acts can, in accordance with one or more embodiments, occur in different orders and/or concurrently with other acts from that shown and described herein. For example, those skilled in the art will understand and appreciate that a methodology could alternatively be represented as a series of interrelated states or events, such as in a state diagram. Moreover, not all illustrated acts can be required to implement a methodology in accordance with one or more embodiments.<br>
[0053]	With reference to Fig. 4, illustrated is a methodology 400 that facilitates<br>
rate matching in a wireless communication environment. At 402, systematic bits, parity<br>
1	bits, and parity 2 bits from an encoder (e.g., turbo coder, ...) can be separated into distinct groups. For instance, a transport block can be split into a plurality of code blocks. A turbo code can be applied to each of the plurality of code blocks to yield a plurality of encoded blocks. The encoded blocks outputted by the turbo code can each include systematic bits, parity 1 bits, and parity 2 bits. Moreover, each of these bit types can be recognized to enable the bits to be separated into the distinct groups. At 404, the systematic bits, the parity 1 bits, and the parity 2 bits can be interleaved within the respective, distinct groups. The systematic bits can be interleaved together to randomize an ordering of the systematic bits, the parity 1 bits can be interleaved together to randomize an ordering of the parity 1 bits, and the parity 2 bits can be interleaved together to randomize an ordering of the parity 2 bits; thus, three randomized orderings can be yielded (e.g., one each for the systematic bits, the parity 1 bits, and the parity 2 bits). At 406, the interleaved parity 1 bits can be interlaced with the interleaved parity 2 bits. For example, the randomized ordering of parity 1 bits and the randomized ordering of parity 2 bits can be combined in an alternating fashion where each bit in the interlaced output alternates between being a parity 1 bit or a parity<br>
2	bit. According to another illustration, any disparate, pre-defined pattern can be used to combine the randomized ordering of parity 1 bits with the randomized ordering of parity 2 bits. At 408, the interleaved systematic bits can be inserted into a circular buffer followed by the interlaced and interleaved parity 1 and parity 2 bits. Thus, the interleaved systematic bits can be preferentially selected for inclusion in the circular buffer.  Moreover, upon all systematic bits being inserted into the circular buffer, the<br><br>
071243<br>
18<br>
interlaced parity 1 and parity 2 bits can be incorporated into the circular buffer using any available resources. At 410, the bits inserted into the circular buffer can be transmitted. Thus, for example, if all systematic bits and a portion of the parity 1 and 2 bits fit in the circular buffer, these incorporated bits can be transferred via a channel while a remainder of the parity 1 and 2 bits can be excluded from being sent; however, if all systematic bits as well as all parity 1 and 2 bits fit in the circular buffer, then all such bits can be sent via the channel.<br>
[0054]	Turning to Fig. 5, illustrated is a methodology 500 that facilitates<br>
preferentially treating systematic bits in connection with circular buffer based rate matching in a wireless communication environment. At 502, systematic bits from at least one encoded block outputted by an encoder (e.g., a turbo coder, ...) can be identified. For instance, the systematic bits can be recognized utilizing a priori knowledge of a format for encoded blocks yielded from the encoder. At 504, the identified systematic bits can be collected. At 506, the collected systematic bits can be interleaved together to generate a randomized sequence of the systematic bits. At 508, the randomized sequence of the systematic bits can be transmitted prior to transmission of parity bits included in the at least one encoded block outputted by the encoder. For instance, the parity bits can include parity 1 bits and parity 2 bits. The randomized sequence of the systematic bits, for instance, can be inserted into a circular buffer prior to inclusion of the parity bits.<br>
[0055]	Now referring to Fig. 6, illustrated is a methodology 600 that facilitates<br>
employing rate matching using a circular buffer in a wireless communication environment. At 602, parity 1 bits and parity 2 bits can be identified from at least one encoded block outputted by an encoder (e.g., a turbo coder, ...). The parity 1 bits and the parity 2 bits, for example, can be recognized using a priori knowledge of a format for encoded blocks generated from the encoder. At 604, the identified parity 1 bits can be assembled in a first collection and the identified parity 2 bits can be assembled in a second collection. At 606, the collected parity 1 bits can be interleaved together to generate a randomized sequence of the parity 1 bits. At 608, the collected parity 2 bits can be interleaved together to generate a randomized sequence of the parity 2 bits. At 610, the randomized sequence of the parity 1 bits and the randomized sequence of the parity 2 bits can be interlaced in an alternating manner to yield an interlaced sequence of parity 1 and 2 bits. According to another illustration, any disparate, pre-defined pattern<br><br>
071243<br>
19<br>
can be used to combine the randomized sequence of the parity 1 bits with the randomized sequence of the parity 2 bits. At 612, at least a portion of the interlaced sequence of parity 1 and 2 bits can be transmitted using resources available subsequent to transfer of an entire sequence of systematic bits included in the at least one encoded block outputted by the encoder.<br>
[0056]	It will be appreciated that, in accordance with one or more aspects<br>
described herein, inferences can be made regarding employing circular buffer based rate<br>
matching. As used herein, the term to "infer" or "inference" refers generally to the<br>
process of reasoning about or inferring states of the system, environment, and/or user<br>
from a set of observations as captured via events and/or data. Inference can be<br>
employed to identify a specific context or action, or can generate a probability<br>
distribution over states, for example. The inference can be probabilistic-that is, the<br>
computation of a probability distribution over states of interest based on a consideration<br>
of data and events. Inference can also refer to techniques employed for composing<br>
higher-level events from a set of events and/or data. Such inference results in the<br>
construction of new events or actions from a set of observed events and/or stored event<br>
data, whether or not the events are correlated in close temporal proximity, and whether<br>
the events and data come from one or several event and data sources.<br>
[0057]	According to an example, one or methods presented above can include<br>
making inferences pertaining to deciphering a bit type (e.g., systematic, parity 1, parity 2). By way of further illustration, an inference can be made related to determining how to combine (e.g., interlace) the parity 1 and parity 2 bits; as such, differing weightings for each of the parity bit types can be assigned based upon such inference, for example. It will be appreciated that the foregoing examples are illustrative in nature and are not intended to limit the number of inferences that can be made or the manner in which such inferences are made in conjunction with the various embodunents and/or methods described herein.<br>
[0058]	Fig.  7 is an illusfration of an access terminal 700 that facilitates<br>
performing circular buffer based rate matching in a wireless communication system. Access terminal 700 comprises a receiver 702 that receives a signal from, for instance, a receive anteima (not shown), and performs typical actions thereon (e.g., filters, amplifies, dovraconverts, etc.) the received signal and digitizes the conditioned signal to obtain samples.    Receiver 702 can be, for example, an MMSE receiver, and can<br><br>
071243<br>
20<br>
comprise a demodulator 704 that can demodulate received symbols and provide them to a processor 706 for channel estimation. Processor 706 can be a processor dedicated to analyzing information received by receiver 702 and/or generating information for transmission by a transmitter 716, a processor that controls one or more components of access terminal 700, and/or a processor that both analyzes information received by receiver 702, generates information for transmission by transmitter 716, and controls one or more components of access terminal 700.<br>
[0059]	Access terminal 700 can additionally comprise memory 708 that is<br>
operatively coupled to processor 706 and that can store data to be transmitted, received data, and any other suitable information related to performing the various actions and functions set forth herein. Memory 708 can additionally store protocols and/or algorithms associated with circular buffer based rate matching.<br>
[0060]	It will be appreciated that the data store (e.g., memory 708) described<br>
herein can be either volatile memory or nonvolatile memory, or can include both<br>
volatile and nonvolatile memory. By way of illustration, and not limitation, nonvolatile<br>
memory can include read only memory (ROM), programmable ROM (PROM),<br>
electrically programmable ROM (EPROM), electrically erasable PROM (EEPROM), or<br>
flash memory. Volatile memory can include random access memory (RAM), which<br>
acts as external cache memory. By way of illustration and not limitation, RAM is<br>
available in many forms such as synchronous RAM (SRAM), dynamic RAM (DRAM),<br>
synchronous DRAM (SDRAM), double data rate SDRAM (DDR SDRAM), enhanced<br>
SDRAM (ESDRAM), Synchlink -DRAM (SLDRAM), and direct Rambus RAM<br>
(DRRAM). The memory 708 of the subject systems and methods is intended to<br>
comprise, without being limited to, these and any other sxoitable types of memory.<br>
[0061]	Receiver 702 is fiirther operatively coupled to an interleaver 710 and/or<br>
an interlacer 712, which can be substantially similar to interleaver 208 of Fig. 2 and interlacer 210 of Fig. 2. Moreover, although not shown, it is contemplated that access terminal 700 can include a turbo code encoder substantially similar to turbo code encoder 204 of Fig. 2, a bit type separator substantially similar to bit type separator 206 of Fig. 2, and/or a mapper substantially similar to mapper 212 of Fig. 2. Interleaver 710 can interleave systematic bits included in encoded block(s) together to yield a first randomized sequence of systematic bits. This first randomized sequence of systematic bits can thereafter be mapped to a circular buffer (e.g., inserted into the circular buffer.<br><br>
071243<br>
21<br>
...). Moreover, interleaver 710 can interleave parity 1 bits together and can interleave<br>
parity 2 bits together. Interlacer 712 can thereafter create a second randomized<br>
sequence including interleaved parity 1 and parity 2 bits interlaced amongst each other<br>
in an alternating manner. Moreover, this second randomized sequence of interlaced and<br>
interleaved parity 1 and parity 2 bits can be incorporated into the circular buffer such<br>
that bits from the first randomized sequence are transmitted first followed by bits fi-om<br>
the second randomized sequence. Access terminal 700 still fiirther comprises a<br>
modulator 714 and a transmitter 716 that transmits the signal to, for instance, a base<br>
station, another access terminal, etc. Although depicted as being separate fi-om the<br>
processor 706, it is to be appreciated that interleaver 710, interlacer 712 and/or<br>
modulator 714 can be part of processor 706 or a number of processors (not shown).<br>
[0062]	Fig. 8 is an illustration of a system 800 that facilitates performing<br>
circular buffer based rate matching in a wireless communication environment. System 800 comprises a base station 802 {e.g., access point, ...) with a receiver 810 that receives signal(s) from one or more access terminals 804 through a plurality of receive antennas 806, and a transmitter 822 that transmits to the one or more access terminals 804 through a transmit antenna 808. Receiver 810 can receive information from receive antennas 806 and is operatively associated with a demodulator 812 that demodulates received information. Demodulated symbols are analyzed by a processor 814 that can be similar to the processor described above with regard to Fig. 7, and which is coupled to a memory 816 that stores data to be transmitted to or received from access terminal(s) 804 (or a disparate base station (not shown)) and/or any other suitable information related to performing the various actions and fimctions set forth herein. Processor 814 is fiirther coupled to an interleaver 818 that generates a randomized sequence of systematic bits, generates a randomized sequence of parity 1 bits, and generates a randomized sequence of parity 2 bits. For instance, the systematic bits, the parity 1 bits, and the parity 2 bits can be included in at least one encoded block outputted by a turbo code encoder.<br>
[0063]	Interleaver 818 can be operatively coupled to an interlacer 820 that<br>
combines the randomized sequence of parity 1 bits and the randomized sequence of parity 2 bits to yield an interlaced, randomized sequence of parity 1 and 2 bits. For instance, interlacer 820 can alternate between parity 1 bits and parity 2 bits in an outputted sequence of parity 1 and 2 bits yielded therefrom.   Moreover, although not<br><br>

shown, it is contemplated that base station 802 can include a turbo code encoder<br>
substantially similar to turbo code encoder 204 of Fig. 2, a bit type separator<br>
substantially similar to bit type separator 206 of Fig. 2, and/or a mapper substantially<br>
similar to mapper 212 of Fig. 2. Interleaver 818 and interlacer 820 (and/or a mapper<br>
(not shown)) can provide data to be transmitted to a modulator 822. For example, the<br>
data to be transmitted can be bits wrapped around a circular buffer. Following this<br>
example, the randomized sequence of systematic bits can be wrapped around the<br>
circular buffer first, and then the interlaced, randomized sequence of parity 1 and 2 bits<br>
can be wrapped around the circular buffer. Thus, depending upon resource availability,<br>
a portion or all of the systematic bits can be transmitted. Further, if all of the systematic<br>
bits are transmitted, then a portion or all of the parity 1 and 2 bits can be transmitted.<br>
Modulator 822 can multiplex the frame for transmission by a transmitter 826 through<br>
anteima 808 to access terminal(s) 804. Although depicted as being separate from the<br>
processor 814, it is to be appreciated that interleaver 818, interlacer 820 and/or<br>
modulator 822 can be part of processor 814 or a number of processors (not shown).<br>
[0064]	Fig. 9 shows an example wireless communication system 900.    The<br>
wireless communication system 900 depicts one base station 910 and one access terminal 950 for sake of brevity. However, it is to be appreciated that system 900 can include more than one base station and/or more than one access terminal, wherein additional base stations and/or access terminals can be substantially similar or different from example base station 910 and access terminal 950 described below. In addition, it is to be appreciated that base station 910 and/or access terminal 950 can employ the systems (Figs. 1-2, 7-8, and 10) and/or methods (Figs. 4-6) described herein to facilitate wireless communication there between.<br>
[0065]	At base station 910, traffic data for a number of data sfreams is provided<br>
from a data source 912 to a transmit (TX) data processor 914.    According to an<br>
example, each data stream can be transmitted oyer a respective antenna.    TX data<br>
processor 914 formats, codes, and interleaves the traffic data sfream based on a<br>
particular coding scheme selected for that data stream to provide coded data.<br>
[0066]	The coded data for each data stream can be multiplexed with pilot data<br>
using orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) techniques. Additionally or alternatively, the pilot symbols can be frequency division multiplexed (FDM), time division multiplexed (TDM), or code division multiplexed (CDM).   The pilot data is<br><br>
071243<br>
23<br>
typically a known data pattern that is processed in a known manner and can be used at access terminal 950 to estimate channel response. The multiplexed pilot and coded data for each data stream can be modulated (e.g., symbol mapped) based on a particular modulation scheme (e.g., binary phase-shift keying (BPSK), quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK), M-phase-shift keying (M-PSK), M-quadrature amplitude modulation (M-QAM), etc.) selected for that data stream to provide modulation sjonbols. The data rate, coding, and modulation for each data stream can be determined by instructions performed or provided by processor 930.<br>
[0067]	The modulation symbols for the data streams can be provided to a TX<br>
MIMO processor 920, which can further process the modulation symbols (e.g., for OFDM). TX MIMO processor 920 then provides NT modulation symbol streams to NT transmitters (TMTR) 922a through 922t. In various embodiments, TX MIMO processor 920 applies beamforming weights to the symbols of the data streams and to the antenna from which the symbol is being transmitted.<br>
[0068]	Each transmitter 922 receives and processes a respective symbol stream<br>
to provide one or more analog signals, and further conditions (e.g., amplifies, filters,<br>
and upconverts) the  analog  signals  to  provide  a modulated  signal  suitable  for<br>
transmission over the MIMO channel. Further, NT modulated signals from fransmitters<br>
922a through 922t are transmitted from NT antennas 924a through 924t, respectively.<br>
[0069]	At access terminal 950, the transmitted modulated signals are received by<br>
NR antermas 952a through 952r and the received signal from each antenna 952 is provided to a respective receiver (RCVR) 954a through 954r. Each receiver 954 conditions (e.g., filters, amplifies, and downconverts) a respective signal, digitizes the conditioned signal to provide samples, and fiirther processes the samples to provide a corresponding "received" symbol stream.<br>
[0070]	An RX data processor 960 can receive and process the NR received<br>
symbol streams from NR receivers 954 based on a particular receiver processing technique to provide NT "detected" symbol streams. RX data processor 960 can demodulate, deinterleave, and decode each detected symbol stream to recover the traffic data for the data stream. The processing by RX data processor 960 is complementary to that performed by TX MIMO processor 920 and TX data processor 914 at base station 910.<br><br>
071243<br>
24<br>
[0071]	A processor 970 can periodically determine which available technology<br>
to utilize as discussed above.    Further, processor 970 can formulate a reverse link<br>
message comprising a matrix index portion and a rank value portion.<br>
[0072]	The reverse link message can comprise various types of information<br>
regarding the communication link and/or the received data stream. The reverse link<br>
message can be processed by a TX data processor 938, which also receives traffic data<br>
for a number of data streams from a data source 936, modulated by a modulator 980,<br>
conditioned by transmitters 954a through 954r, and transmitted back to base station 910.<br>
[0073]	At base station 910, the modulated signals from access terminal 950 are<br>
received by antennas 924, conditioned by receivers 922, demodulated by a demodulator 940, and processed by a RX data processor 942 to extract the reverse link message transmitted by access terminal 950. Further, processor 930 can process the extracted message to determine which precoding matrix to use for determining the beamforming weights.<br>
[0074]	Processors 930 and 970 can direct (e.g., control, coordinate, manage,<br>
etc.) operation at base station 910 and access terminal 950, respectively.   Respective<br>
processors 930 and 970 can be associated with memory 932 and 972 that store program<br>
codes and data.   Processors 930 and 970 can also perform computations to derive<br>
frequency and impulse response estimates for the uplink and downlink, respectively.<br>
[0075]	In an aspect, logical chaimels are classified into Control Channels and<br>
Traffic Channels. Logical Control Chaimels can include a Broadcast Control Channel (BCCH), which is a DL channel for broadcasting system control information. Further, Logical Control Chaimels can include a Paging Control Channel (PCCH), which is a DL channel that transfers paging information. Moreover, the Logical Control Channels can comprise a Multicast Control Channel (MCCH), which is a Point-to-multipoint DL channel used for transmitting Multimedia Broadcast and Multicast Service (MBMS) scheduling and control information for one or several MTCHs. Generally, after establishing a Radio Resource Control (RRC) connection, this channel is only used by UEs that receive MBMS (e.g., old MCCH+MSCH). Additionally, the Logical Control Channels can include a Dedicated Control Channel (DCCH), which is a Point-to-point bi-directional channel that transmits dedicated control information and can be used by UEs having a RRC connection. In an aspect, the Logical Traffic Channels can comprise a Dedicated Traffic Channel (DTCH), which is a Point-to-point bi-directional channel<br><br>
071243<br>
25<br>
dedicated to one UE for the transfer of user information. Also, the Logical Traffic Chaimels can include a Multicast Traffic Channel (MTCH) for Point-to-multipoint DL channel for transmitting traffic data.<br>
[0076]	In an aspect, Transport Channels are classified into DL and UL.   DL<br>
Transport Channels comprise a Broadcast Chaimel (BCH), a Downlink Shared Data<br>
Channel (DL-SDCH) and a Paging Channel (PCH). The PCH can support UE power<br>
saving (e.g., Discontinuous Reception (DRX) cycle can be indicated by the network to<br>
the UE, ...) by being broadcasted over an entire cell and being mapped to Physical layer<br>
(PHY) resources that can be used for other control/traffic channels. The UL Transport<br>
Channels can comprise a Random Access Channel (RACH), a Request Channel<br>
(REQCH), a Uplink Shared Data Channel (UL-SDCH) and a plurality of PHY channels.<br>
[0077]	The PHY channels can include a set of DL channels and UL channels.<br>
For example, the DL PHY channels can include: Common Pilot Channel (CPICH); Synchronization Channel (SCH); Common Control Channel (CCCH); Shared DL Control Channel (SDCCH); Multicast Control Channel (MCCH); Shared UL Assignment Channel (SUACH); Acknowledgement Chaimel (ACKCH); DL Physical Shared Data Channel (DL-PSDCH); UL Power Control Channel (UPCCH); Paging Indicator Channel (PICH); and/or Load Indicator Channel (LICH). By way of further illustration, the UL PHY Channels can include: Physical Random Access Channel (PRACH); Channel Quality Indicator Channel (CQICH); Acknowledgement Channel (ACKCH); Antenna Subset Indicator Channel (ASICH); Shared Request Channel (SREQCH); UL Physical Shared Data Channel (UL-PSDCH); and/or Broadband. Pilot Channel (BPICH).<br>

[0081]	With reference to Fig. 10, illustrated is a system 1000 that enables<br>
employing rate matching in a wireless communication environment. For example, system 1000 can reside at least partially within a base station. According to another illustration, system 1000 can reside at least partially within an access terminal. It is to be appreciated that system 1000 is represented as including functional blocks, which can be ftmctional blocks that represent fimctions implemented by a processor, software, or combination thereof (e.^., firmware). System 1000 includes a logical grouping 1002 of electrical components that can act in conjunction. For instance, logical grouping 1002 can include an electrical component for interleaving systematic bits collected from at least one encoded block outputted by an encoder 1004. Further, logical grouping 1002 can comprise an electrical component for interleaving parity 1 bits collected from the at least one encoded block 1006. Moreover, logical grouping 1002 can include an electrical component for interleaving parity 2 bits collected from the at least one encoded block 1008. Logical grouping 1002 can also include an electrical component for interlacing the interleaved parity 1 bits and the interleaved parity 2 bits 1010. For example, the interleaved systematic bits can be wrapped around a circular buffer first and the interlaced parity 1 and 2 bits can be wrapped aroimd the circular buffer thereafter. Following this example, the bits wrapped around the circular buffer can be fransmitted via a channel, while remaining bits not included in the circular buffer can be<br><br>

27<br>
excluded from being transmitted. Additionally, system 1000 can include a memory 1012 that retains instructions for executing functions associated with electrical components 1004, 1006, 1008, and 1010. While shown as being external to memory 1012, it is to be imderstood that one or more of electrical components 1004, 1006, 1008, and 1010 can exist within memory 1012.<br>
