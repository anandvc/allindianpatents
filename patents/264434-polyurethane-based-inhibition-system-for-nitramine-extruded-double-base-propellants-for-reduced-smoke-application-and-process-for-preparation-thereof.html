				<td>Field of Invention<br>
This invention relates to an inhibition system for nitramine extruded double base<br>
propellants and a process for preparation thereof wherein inhibition system<br>
comprises of inhibitor composition and a formulation for chemical coating for<br>
nitramine containing extruded double base propellants with low signature<br>
features.<br>
Background and prior arts<br>
To achieve a definite pattern of propellant burning polymeric materials are applied on surface of propellant. Nitramine propellant is a low signature propellant. For low signature application of missile, apart from propellant, the inhibitors too are required to have minimum smoke/solid particles in rocket exhaust. Release of smoke/solid particles in exhaust reveals the launch location of the missile and in the case of optically guided missiles, the smoke masks the radiation coming from missile leading to the loss of control of the missile. Nitramine extruded double base (EDB) propellants basically comprise of nitrocellulose, nitroglycerine and nitramine such as cyclotrimethyl trinitramine (RDX) as high-energy materials in addition to other additives.<br>
There are number of inhibition systems known in the art for double base propellants. However, a few inhibitor materials are known in the art for nitramine based propellants, however with following disadvantages.<br>
Inhibition formulations for nitramine based cast composite modified double base propellants known in the art are based on hydroxy- terminated polybutadiene (HTPB), di-isocyanates, carbon black, antimony trioxide etc.<br>
The above inhibition systems known in the art have the disadvantage of producing high smoke density and hence are not suitable for propellants selected for low signature application.<br>
Inhibition formulation for nitramine containing extruded double base propellants having low signature feature is not known in prior art.<br>
Objects of the present invention<br>
The primary object of the present invention is to provide a polyurethane based inhibition system as a combination of an inhibitor composition and a formulation for chemical coating to nitramine based extruded double base (EDB) propellant, which exhibits extreme temperature operational capability.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a polyurethane based inhibition system with low smoke level for nitramine EDB propellant.<br>
Still another object of the invention is to provide a polyurethane based inhibition system, which has good mechanical properties for nitramine EDB propellant.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a polyurethane based inhibition system suitable for machining to achieve desired shape and configuration.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide polyurethane based inhibition system for Nitramine EDB propellant, which exhibits extreme temperature operational capability from -30°C to +55°C.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a formulation for chemical coating for nitramine EDB propellants, which minimizes plasticizer migration from propellant to inhibitor.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is to provide a polyurethane based inhibition formulation and a chemical coating for nitramine EDB propellants which has shelf life of a minimum of 8 years.<br>
Statement of the Invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to an inhibitor formulation for nitramine extruded double based propellant comprises polyether polyol, aliphatic di-isocyanate, melamine and ferric acetyl acetonate.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
In view of the low signature application, present invention consists of inhibitor formulation and chemical coating for nitramine extruded double base propellants, which yields low smoke and withstands extreme environmental test conditions. The formulation uses polyether polyol as resin, isophorone di-isocyanate (IPDI) as curative and melamine as filler. A curing catalyst viz. ferric acetyl acetonate (FeAA) is used. The propellant on which this inhibitor formulation is to be applied is coated with an adduct of 1,2,6 - hexanetriol (HT) and hexamethylene di-isocyanate (HMDI). This adduct formulation substantially minimizes plasticizer, migration between propellant and inhibitor and improves the shelf life of inhibited propellants.<br>

Still another embodiment of the present invention the inhibition system based on<br>
polyurethane for nitramine extruded double base propellants is prepared by the<br>
process consisting of following steps:<br>
a)        Preparation of Inhibition Composition:<br>
1.	47.6 to 71.5% of polyether polyol mixed with 12.38 to 18.56% by weight of curative preferably aliphatic di-isocyanate. Polyether polyol taken has viscosity between 1000 and 1200 cp, functionality between 3.0 and 3.5 and hydroxyl value (mg of KOH/g) between 130 and 140. Curator isophorone diisocyanate is taken with purity higher than 98%. The mixture is stirred well for about 5 minutes.<br>
2.	To the mixture of polyol and curator, 20-30% of melamine as filler is added in small fractions and stirring is continued for about 15 - 20 minutes. The mixture is de-aerated for 10-15 minutes. To the mixture 0.005- 0.01 part of ferric acetyl acetonate (FeAA) is added as a catalyst and stirring is continued for about 5 minutes. The inhibition material thus prepared is de-aerated for 5-7 minutes (
(b)	Preparation of formulation of chemical coating<br>
An adduct is prepared by mixing 25-30 parts by weight of 1, 2, 6-hexanetriol (HT) with 94-113 parts by weight of hexamethylene diisocyanate (HMDI). The reaction is carried out in dichloromethane solvent (450-550 ml) in presence of catalyst, wherein the catalyst is di-butyl tin dilaurate (DBTL) in a concentration in the range of 0.02 -0.03%.<br>
(c)	Method of application of coating and inhibition composition:<br>

The adduct coated propellants thus prepared are inhibited with the inhibition formulation using Vacuum Casting Technique. The inhibited grains are then cured and machined to the required dimensions.<br>
The invention will now be illustrated with a working example, which is intended to illustrate the working of the invention and is not intended to be taken restrictively to imply any limitation on the scope of the present invention.<br><br>
Example:<br>
The present invention is illustrated by the following examples, which are set forth to illustrate the present invention and are not to be construed as limiting thereof.<br>
59.52% by weight polyether polyol is taken into mixing vessel and 15.47% by weight Isophorone di-isocyanate (IPDI) is added. The mixture is stirred well for 5-10 minutes. To the mixture of Polyol and curator 25 parts by weight of melamine is added in installments under stirring. Stirring is continued for further 15-20 minutes. The mixture is de-aerated for 10-15 minutes. Ferric acetylaetonate catalyst 0.008 part is added and mixture is stirred well for 5 minutes and de-aerated (
A coat of adduct prepared form HT and HMDI in dichloromethane is given on propellant surface and dried at 50 ± 2 °C for 2 hours. The inhibitor composition is cast over the propellant assembled in a mould under vacuum (
Cured inhibitor is also characterized for bond strength, mechanical properties, and glass transition temperature and smoke density measurement. Plasticizer migration is estimated by dipping adduct coated cured inhibitor samples in desensitized nitroglycerine (NG) for 72 hours at ambient. Shelf life of the inhibited propellant is assessed by accelerated storage trials at elevated temperature of 50 ± 2 °C. Inhibited grains were subjected to static evaluation at ambient, hot (+55°C) and cold (-30°C) conditions. P-t profiles obtained were as per prediction of desired performance. More than 95% transmission was achieved<br>
in visible and IR region for this inhibitor formulation. Based on accelerated storage trials, minimum shelf life of 8 years was assigned for inhibited propellants.<br>
