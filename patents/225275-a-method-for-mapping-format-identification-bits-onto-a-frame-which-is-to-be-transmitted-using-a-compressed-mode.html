Method for mapping format identification bits onto a<br>
frame which is to be transmitted using a compressed<br>
mode<br>
The present invention relates to a method for mapping<br>
format identification bits, that is to say so-called<br>
TFCI bits, onto a frame to be transmitted, in<br>
particular onto a compressed frame to be transmitted<br>
using the so-called compressed mode <br>
Mobile radio technology is subject to rapid<br>
development. At the moment, work is being carried out<br>
on the standardization of the so-called UMTS Mobile<br>
Radio Standard (^Universal Mobile Telecommunication<br>
System') for third-generation mobile radios.<br>
Information to be transmitted via a mobile radio<br>
channel is normally transmitted in the form of a pre-<br>
defined frame and time slot structure. A UMTS frame<br>
comprises 15 time slots "slots", with specific system<br>
information also being transmitted as well as the<br>
actual data within each frame. This system information<br>
includes, in particular, a known pilot bit sequence or<br>
training sequence, which the respective receiver can<br>
use to estimate the channel impulse response of the<br>
respective mobile radio channel, power control<br>
information in the form of one or more TPC bits<br>
(Transmit Power Control), whose contact is used to<br>
control the transmission power of the respective<br>
receiver, and format identification information in the<br>
form of so-called TFCI bits (Transport Format<br>
Combination Indicator).<br>
On the basis of the current status of UMTS<br>
standardization, a TFCI code word is provided for each<br>
UMTS frame, comprising ten initially uncoded bits which<br>
are then coded using a second-order (32, 10) subcode of<br>
the Reed-Muller code, and are thus mapped onto a total<br>
of 32 bits. Of these 32 bits, bit nos. 0 and 16 are<br>
then punctured in the normal mode (in the normal mode<br>
or non-compressed mode), so that the TFCI code word now<br>
comprises only 30 TFCI bits, which are then mapped or<br>
distributed uniformly with two TFCI bits in each case<br>
onto the individual time slots in the corresponding<br>
UMTS frame.<br>
These are allocated in such a way that the two most<br>
significant TFCI bits in the TFCI code word are<br>
allocated to the time slot no. 0 which is transmitted<br>
first within the UMTS frame, and the two least<br>
significant bits are allocated to the time slot no. 14,<br>
which is transmitted last within the frame. The more<br>
significant TFCI bit is then transmitted before the<br>
less significant TFCI bit within the individual time<br>
slots. The mapping or allocation of the TFCI bits in<br>
the TFCI code word onto or to the individual time slots<br>
in a frame is also referred to as mapping.<br>
The term "puncturing" for the purposes of the present<br>
application also includes the removal or non-<br>
transmission of specific bits, in particular also the<br>
last bits.<br>
In addition to normal transmission of information in<br>
uncompressed form, a compressed mode is also provided<br>
for data transmission. In the compressed mode, the<br>
information in the respective frame is transmitted in<br>
compressed form, in order in this way to artificially<br>
produce a transmission gap, during whose duration the<br>
absence of transmitted information can be used, for<br>
example, for intermediate-frequency measurements in<br>
order to prepare for handover processes etc.<br>
In the compressed mode, at least eight time slots must<br>
still be left free per frame. The 30 TFCI bits must in<br>
consequence be distributed between the remaining time<br>
slots in the compressed mode. In order to allow this,<br>
the time slot format of the uplink control channel<br>
DPCCH (Dedicated Physical Control Channel) and of the<br>
downlink control channel DPCCH, as well as that of the<br>
downlink data channel DPDCH (Dedicated Physical Data<br>
Channel) must be matched.<br>
In this context, various time slot formats have been<br>
proposed for the uplink DPCCH control channel for the<br>
compressed mode and these can be summarized by the<br>
table shown in Figure 4, in which the number NTFCi of<br>
TFCI bits transmitted per time slot and the total<br>
number D of TFCI bits transmitted per frame are in each<br>
case shown for a different number of time slots or<br>
slots transmitted per frame in the compressed mode.<br>
Corresponding proposals for time slot formats for the<br>
downlink in the compressed mode have also been made,<br>
which can be summarized by the tables shown in Figure<br>
5A and Figure 5B where Figure 5A relates to a spread<br>
factor of between 128 and 512 being used for the<br>
corresponding channelization codes or spread codes,<br>
while Figure 5B relates to spread factors of between 4<br>
and 64. Analogously to Figure 4, these tables each show<br>
the number NTfci of TFCI bits transmitted per time slot<br>
and the total number D of TFCI bits transmitted per<br>
frame for a different number of time slots or slots<br>
transmitted per frame in the compressed mode, with a<br>
distinction also being drawn in this case between Type<br>
A and Type B transmission.<br>
Since it is desirable to use a standard time slot<br>
format for each frame, situations may occur - as is<br>
indicated by the individual values for D in Figure 4<br>
and Figures 5A/B - in which more TFCI points are<br>
available in each frame than are actually required for<br>
the 30 TFCI bits.<br>
For the uplink, that is to say for transmission from a<br>
mobile part to a base station, it has thus been<br>
proposed that selected TFCI bits be repeated in the<br>
compressed mode, that is to say that they be<br>
reiterated, in order to fill the excess TFCI points,<br>
with, in particular, those bits which are sent<br>
immediately after the transmission gap that occurs in<br>
the compressed mode being repeated at free TFCI points<br>
for this purpose, in order that the repetition is<br>
carried out as effectively as possible. The reason for<br>
this is based on the fact that the transmission power<br>
control is very uncertain immediately after the<br>
transmission gap, so that the probability of a<br>
transmission being subject to interference is highest<br>
immediately after the transmission gap, so that these<br>
bits should be repeated, if possible. The repeated bits<br>
can in this case be determined by means of the<br>
following algorithm, where Ck denotes the TFCI bits, dk<br>
denotes the repeated bits, D denotes the number of TFCI<br>
points available in total in the frame, and E denotes<br>
the index or the position of that TFCI point which<br>
immediately follows the transmission gap in the<br>
compressed mode:<br><br>
The bits are allocated to the individual time slots in<br>
the compressed frame in a descending sequence, with the<br>
TFCI bits Ck being transmitted first, followed by the<br>
repeated bits dk, that is to say the bit C29 (Most<br>
Significant Bit (MSB) in the TFCI code word) being<br>
transmitted as the first bit in the TFCI code word,<br>
while d0 is transmitted as the last bit in the TFCI<br>
code word.<br>
For the downlink, that is to say for transmission from<br>
a base station to a mobile part, it has in contrast<br>
been proposed to fill the free or excess TFCI points<br>
with so-called DTX bits {Discontinuous Transmission<br>
Bits) in the compressed mode. A DTX bit in this case<br>
corresponds to a bit which is not transmitted, that is<br>
to say a bit whose energy is zero. A transmission pause<br>
with a time duration of one DTX bit is thus inserted at<br>
each of the appropriate points in the relevant time<br>
slots.<br>
Against the background of the prior art described<br>
above, the present invention is based on the object of<br>
proposing a method for mapping TFCI bits onto a frame<br>
which is to be sent in a compressed mode, which makes<br>
it possible to improve the transmission power and the<br>
transmission reliability without any additional<br>
complexity.<br>
According to the invention, this object is achieved by<br>
a method having the features of claim 1. The dependent<br>
claims each define advantageous and preferred<br>
embodiments of the present invention.<br>
According to the invention it is proposed that the<br>
excess TFCI points be filled by repetition of the TFCI<br>
bits following the transmission gap, but with these<br>
TFCI bits being repeated in the reverse sequence. This<br>
procedure is worthwhile since it can be assumed that<br>
those TFCI bits which are sent after the transmission<br>
gap have a lower bit error rate as the distance from<br>
the transmission gap increases. For this reason, it is<br>
better to repeat those TFCI bits which have the highest<br>
bit error rate owing to their proximity to the<br>
transmission gap in a time slot which is as far away<br>
from the transmission gap as possible.<br>
The present invention is based on the knowledge that,<br>
in the compressed mode, the transmission gap interferes<br>
with the power control, which stabilizes only as the<br>
distance from the transmission gap increases. The<br>
filling of additional TFCI points with TFCI bits (in<br>
the uplink and/or downlink) or DTX bits (in the<br>
downlink) is optimized on the basis of this fact.<br>
Furthermore, the invention and exemplary embodiments of<br>
the present invention are based on the knowledge that<br>
it is better to send the previously punctured TFCI bits<br>
than to repeat TFCI bits which were sent in poor power<br>
control conditions.<br>
The invention will be explained in more detail in the<br>
following text using preferred exemplary embodiments<br>
and with reference to the attached drawing.<br>
Figure 1 shows a simplified block diagram of an<br>
arrangement for coding, puncturing and mapping TFCI<br>
bits onto a UMTS frame which is to be sent using the<br>
so-called compressed mode, which arrangement can be<br>
used in a transmitting apparatus according to the<br>
invention,<br>
Figure 2 shows an illustration to explain the mapping<br>
of the TFCI bits onto a UMTS frame,<br>
Figure 3 shows an illustration to explain various<br>
exemplary embodiments of the present invention relating<br>
to the compressed mode,<br>
Figure 4 shows a table listing various known time slot<br>
formats for a UMTS frame transmitted via an uplink<br>
connection in the compressed mode, and<br>
Figures 5A and 5B show tables listing various known<br>
time slot formats for a UMTS frame transmitted via a<br>
downlink connection in the compressed mode.<br>
Before describing in any more detail the various<br>
exemplary embodiments according to the invention, the<br>
fundamental design of an arrangement for mapping TFCI<br>
bits onto a UMTS frame, as shown in Figure 1, will be<br>
explained first of all. A (32, 10) coder 1 is supplied<br>
with uncoded TFCI bits, which are to be mapped onto the<br>
respective UMTS frame. In principle, the number of<br>
uncoded TFCI bits is variable and is defined by means<br>
of appropriate signaling at the start of a connection.<br>
However, if there are less than ten uncoded TFCI bits,<br>
the corresponding TFCI word is filled with zeros to<br>
make a total of ten bits, with the more significant<br>
bits being set to zero in this case. This ensures that<br>
the (32, 10) coder 1 is always supplied with a TFCI<br>
word having ten TFCI bits.<br>
The (32, 10) coder 1 codes the TFCI word supplied to it<br>
using a second-order (32, 10) subcode of the so-called<br>
Reed-Muller code. The corresponding (31-10) coder 1 is<br>
in this case structured such that the TFCI code word<br>
emitted from the (32, 10) coder 1 is formed by a linear<br>
combination (controlled by the uncoded TFCI bits) of<br>
ten different basic sequences.<br>
The TFCI code word which is emitted from the (32, 10)<br>
coder 1 and which now comprises 32 bits is then<br>
supplied to a puncturing unit 2, in which the bit no. 0<br>
and the bit no. 16 are punctured, that is to say they<br>
are removed from the TFCI code word. The punctured TFCI<br>
code word resulting from this thus now has only 30 TFCI<br>
bits.<br>
The 30 TFCI bits are supplied to a unit 3 whose task is<br>
to assign these bits in the normal mode (that is to say<br>
for uncompressed transmission) or in the compressed<br>
mode (that is to say for compressed transmission) to<br>
the individual time slots or slots in the respective<br>
UMTS frame (see Figure 2).<br>
As has already been described, the 30 TFCI bits in the<br>
normal mode are distributed uniformly between the 15<br>
time slots in the respective UMTS frame, with the two<br>
most significant TFCI bits no. 29 and no. 28 being<br>
mapped onto the time slot no. 0 which is transmitted<br>
first in time, while the two least significant bits no.<br>
1 and no. 0 are mapped onto the time slot no. 14 which<br>
is transmitted last within the frame.<br>
Exactly the same configuration of TFCI bits to be<br>
transmitted can, of course, also be achieved in another<br>
way. For example, the numbering of the bits is purely a<br>
conventional question, and the MSB and LSB could also<br>
be defined in a different sequence. Furthermore, the<br>
puncturing operations do not need to relate to the bit<br>
nos. 0 and 16, since other bits may also be punctured.<br>
On the basis of another method of representation, the<br>
elements of the masks used for the Reed-Mueller code<br>
may also be reorganized so that the bits to be<br>
punctured may be placed at any desired points, in<br>
particular even at the end of the TFCI code word. All<br>
these alternative, equivalent forms of representation<br>
are likewise within the scope of the present invention,<br>
even if they are not mentioned explicitly in the<br>
following text.<br>
However, in the compressed mode and as shown in Figure<br>
3, there is a transmission gap in the corresponding<br>
frame, in which no information is transmitted. In the<br>
example shown in Figure 3, this transmission gap covers<br>
the time slots no. 6-8. As has already been described,<br>
this means that the time slot format must be adapted<br>
appropriately, so that, in certain of these adapted<br>
formats, there are more available TFCI points than TFCI<br>
bits (see also Figure 4 and Figures 5A/5B).<br>
In the following text, various options for filling<br>
these excess TFCI points are proposed both for the<br>
uplink and for the downlink, and the exemplary<br>
embodiments proposed in the following text for the<br>
uplink, can also be used for the downlink. Furthermore,<br>
the individual exemplary embodiments may also be<br>
combined with one another.<br>
First of all, a number of exemplary embodiments of the<br>
present invention for the uplink will be explained in<br>
the following text.<br>
According to a first exemplary embodiment, in the<br>
situation where there are more TFCI points than TFCI<br>
bits available in the compressed mode, it is proposed<br>
that the excess TFCI bits should not be filled<br>
immediately by repetition, but that the TFCI points<br>
which are still unfilled should first of all be filled<br>
with the bits no. 0 and no. 16, which were originally<br>
punctured by the puncture unit 2, in the original TFCI<br>
code word. These two bits are preferably placed at the<br>
end of the corresponding UMTS frame. Only after these<br>
bits have been mapped onto the UMTS frame are the TFCI<br>
points which still remain free filled by repetition,<br>
and this is carried out analogously to the prior art<br>
described initially such that the 30 bits in the TFCI<br>
code word are mapped onto the TFCI points which are<br>
transmitted first in time, while the repeated bits are<br>
allocated to the later TFCI points in the frame.<br>
This procedure results in a change to the previously<br>
proposed algorithm for determining the additional TFCI<br>
bits dk as follows, where E denotes the index of the<br>
TFCI point which immediately follows the transmission<br>
gap, ck, where k = 0...29, denotes the 30 TFCI bits in<br>
the punctured TFCI code word, C30 and C31 denotes the<br>
two originally punctured bits no. 6 and no. 16 in the<br>
TFCI code word emitted from the coder 1, and D denotes<br>
the number of TFCI points in the entire frame:<br><br>
For the example shown in Figure 3, this results in the<br>
following procedure for mapping the TFCI bits onto the<br>
respective frame. Since the transmission gap covers<br>
three time slots, only twelve time slots are sent, so<br>
that, on the basis of the table shown in Figure 4,<br>
three TFCI bits should be transmitted in each time<br>
slot, with a total of 36 TFCI bits being transmitted in<br>
the entire frame.<br>
According to the algorithm described above, the TFCI<br>
bits C29 to C12 are initially distributed between the<br>
first time slots no. 0 to no. 5 and the TFCI bits C11 to<br>
Co are initially distributed between the next time<br>
slots no. 9 to no. 12. Thus, once all the TFCI bits in<br>
the punctured TFCI code word have been allocated, the<br>
TFCI bits c11 , C10, C09 are repeated in time slot no.<br>
13, and the originally punctured TFCI bits C30 and C31<br>
are mapped onto the last time slot no. 14, with the<br>
TFCI bit C08 also being repeated in the time slot no.<br>
14.<br>
This procedure is advantageous since it is better to<br>
send the previously punctured bits in the TFCI (32, 10)<br>
code word than to repeat bits which have been sent in<br>
poor conditions, in terms of power control, owing to<br>
the transmission gap which exists in the compression<br>
mode.<br>
The exemplary embodiment described above can also be<br>
modified such that the originally punctured bits are<br>
not placed in the last time slot in the UMTS frame but<br>
are sent directly after the transmission gap. Further-<br>
more, as in the prior art, the TFCI bits which then<br>
immediately follow the transmission gap are repeated.<br>
This procedure has the advantage that those bits which<br>
are normally punctured in any case are sent at the TFCI<br>
points whose transmission conditions are "poor".<br>
Based on the example shown in Figure 3 and according to<br>
this exemplary embodiment, the TFCI bits C29 to C12 are<br>
initially distributed between the first time slots no.<br>
0 to no. 5. The TFCI points in the time slot no. 9 are<br>
filled with the originally punctured bits C30 and C31 as<br>
well as the TFCI bit C11. The TFCI bits C10 to c2 are<br>
assigned to the time slots no. 10 to 12. The time slot<br>
no. 13 is filled by the TFCI bits c01 and c0. Those TFCI<br>
points which are then still available in the time slots<br>
no. 13 and no. 14 are filled, as has already been<br>
described above, by the TFCI bits which immediately<br>
follow the transmission gap, so that bit C30 is repeated<br>
in time slot no. 13, and the bits C31, c11, c10 are<br>
repeated in the time slot no. 14.<br>
It may be expected that those TFCI bits which are sent<br>
after the transmission gap have a lower bit error rate<br>
as their distance from the transmission gap increases,<br>
since the power control can stabilize once again as the<br>
distance from the transmission gap increases. A further<br>
good option for filling the available TFCI points in the<br>
compressed mode is to repeat those TFCI bits which are<br>
transmitted immediately after the transmission gap and<br>
which have the greatest error probability in that time<br>
slot which is furthest away from the transmission gap.<br>
It is thus advantageous to repeat those TFCI bits which<br>
immediately follow the transmission gap in the reverse<br>
sequence (and not in the same sequence, as before).<br>
The algorithm described initially for determining the<br>
repeated bits dk in consequence change as follows:<br><br>
For the example shown in Figure 3, this means that the<br>
TFCI bits C29 to C12 are initially distributed between<br>
the first time slots no. 0 to no. 5, and the TFCI bits<br>
c11 to Co are initially distributed between the next<br>
time slots no. 9 to no. 12. Thus, once all the TFCI<br>
bits in the punctured TFCI code word have been<br>
allocated, those TFCI bits which then immediately<br>
follow the transmission gap are repeated in the reverse<br>
sequence in order to fill those TFCI points which are<br>
still free, that is to say the TFCI bits Co6, C07, C08<br>
are repeated in the time slot no. 13, and the TFCI bits<br>
C09, C10, C11 are repeated in the time slot no. 14.<br>
It is particularly advantageous for this exemplary<br>
embodiment to be combined with the first exemplary<br>
embodiment, that is to say for the two originally<br>
punctured TFCI bits c3o and C31 to be sent in the last<br>
time slot, while those TFCI bits which immediately<br>
follow the transmission gap are repeated in the reverse<br>
sequence in order to fill the free TFCI points. The<br>
following algorithm is therefore used to determine how<br>
the TFCI points dk are filled:<br><br>
For the example shown in Figure 3, this means that the<br>
TFCI bits c29 to C12 are initially distributed between<br>
the first time slots no. 0 to no. 5 and the TFCI bits<br>
c11 to Co are additionally distributed between the next<br>
time slots no. 9 to no. 12. Thus, once all the TFCI<br>
bits in the punctured TFCI code word have been<br>
allocated, those TFCI bits which then immediately<br>
follow the transmission gap are repeated in the reverse<br>
sequence, and the originally punctured bits C30 and C31<br>
are sent in the last time slot in order to fill the<br>
TFCI points which are still free, that is to say the<br>
TFCI bits C08/ C09, C10 are repeated in the time slot no.<br>
13, while the originally punctured TFCI bits c3o and C31<br>
as well as the repeated TFCI bit en are assigned to the<br>
time slot no. 14.<br>
As has already been described, the TFCI bits in the<br>
TFCI (32, 10) code word, which has been punctured<br>
twice, are usually distributed between the first TFCI<br>
points in the respective frame in the compressed mode,<br>
while those TFCI points which are then still available<br>
are filled by repetition. If at least 32 TFCI points<br>
are available, depending on the format respectively<br>
chosen for the compressed mode (see Figure 4), there is<br>
a further option for filling the TFCI points in which<br>
the entire unpunctured (32, 10) code word can be sent<br>
immediately, and in which any TFCI points which are<br>
still free are only then filled by repetition. In this<br>
case, the TFCI code word supplied from the coder 1<br>
would retain its original length and sequence since -<br>
as indicated by dashed lines in Figure 1 - no<br>
puncturing is carried out.<br>
For the example shown in Figure 3, this means that the<br>
TFCI bits C30 to C15, C31 and C14 are initially<br>
distributed between the first time slots no. 0 to no.<br>
5, and the TFCI bits C13 to C02 are initially<br>
distributed between the next time slots no. 9 to no.<br>
12. In this case, it should be noted that C30 denotes<br>
the bit no. 0 and c3i denotes the bit no. 16 in the<br>
unpunctured TFCI code word emitted from the coder 1<br>
(Figure 2 shows only the punctured TFCI code word).<br>
Those TFCI bits C01 and c0 which still remain are sent<br>
first of all in the time slot no. 13. Those TFCI points<br>
which are then still free in the time slot no. 13 and<br>
in the time slot no. 14 are filled by repetition, in<br>
which case the previously described exemplary<br>
embodiments can be used once again for the repetition.<br>
In the present situation, those TFCI bits which<br>
immediately follow the transmission gap are once again<br>
repeated, so that the TFCI bit ci3 is repeated in the<br>
time slot no. 13, while the TFCI bits C12 to C10 are<br>
repeated in the time slot no. 14.<br>
In the following text, exemplary embodiments of the<br>
present invention for filling those TFCI points for the<br>
downlink which are available in the compressed mode<br>
will be explained first of all.<br>
As has already been explained, so-called DTX bits can<br>
be used for this purpose.<br>
Within the scope of the present invention, it is now<br>
proposed that these DTX bits should not be distributed<br>
between those TFCI points which still remain at the end<br>
of the respective frame after transmission of the<br>
punctured TFCI code word, but that these DTX bits<br>
should be transmitted immediately after the<br>
transmission gap that occurs in the compressed mode.<br>
This means that as many DTX bits as there are excess<br>
TFCI points in the frame are transmitted immediately<br>
after the transmission gap. The remaining TFCI points<br>
in the frame are filled with the bits of the punctured<br>
TFCI code word.<br>
This procedure has the advantage that the DTX bits are<br>
used for those TFCI points in which the probability of<br>
transmission being subject to interference is greatest,<br>
owing to the proximity to the transmission gap.<br>
If, as is shown in Figure 3, a frame is transmitted<br>
with a transmission gap covering three time slots, this<br>
means (by way of example for a spread factor of 256)<br>
according to the table shown in Figure 5A that four<br>
TFCI points are available in each time slot (the<br>
downlink frame structure is assumed to be of Type A) .<br>
On the basis of the exemplary embodiment described<br>
above, the TFCI bits c2g to cO6 in the punctured TFCI<br>
code word are accordingly distributed between the time<br>
slots no. 0 to no. 5. 16 DTX bits are sent in the time<br>
slots no. 9 to no. 12, while two DTX bits are sent<br>
first of all in the time slot no. 13, followed by the<br>
TFCI bits c05 and c04 • Finally, the remaining TFCI bits<br>
C03 to c0 in the punctured TFCI code word are sent in<br>
the last time slot no. 14.<br>
Should there be fewer time slots after the transmission<br>
gap than the number required for the DTX bit, those DTX<br>
bits which cannot be transmitted after the transmission<br>
gap can be allocated to the time slots before the<br>
transmission gap. In this case, they may in principle<br>
be distributed in any desired way, in which case it is<br>
advantageous to distribute the DTX bits as uniformly as<br>
possible. As a further embodiment variant, only some of<br>
the DTX bits may also be inserted immediately after the<br>
transmission gap, with the remaining DTX bits being<br>
allocated to the other time slots before and after the<br>
transmission gap. This is particularly advantageous<br>
when more time slots are available after the<br>
transmission gap than are required for stabilization of<br>
the power control.<br>
One specific embodiment variant of the invention<br>
provides for 30 bits of the TFCI code word to be mapped<br>
initially onto the frame to be transmitted, in the<br>
compression mode. Furthermore, two originally punctured<br>
bits or two bits which are not intended to be<br>
transmitted in the normal mode (during normal operation<br>
and in the uncompressed mode) are mapped onto the frame<br>
to be transmitted. If, particularly in the uplink, the<br>
number of format identification points available in the<br>
corresponding compressed frame exceeds the limit of 32<br>
format identification points, then TFCI bits are mapped<br>
repeatedly onto the frame to be transmitted; in<br>
particular, those TFCI bits which are sent shortly<br>
after the transmission gap are mapped repeatedly onto<br>
the frame to be transmitted (they are repeated). This<br>
repeated mapping is in this case carried out in<br>
particular in reverse sequence to that in which these<br>
TFCI bits were first mapped.<br>
If, particularly in the downlink, the number of format<br>
identification points available in the corresponding<br>
compressed frame exceeds the limit of 32 format<br>
identification points, then DTX bits are mapped<br>
repeatedly onto the frame to be transmitted.<br>
Finally, it should be mentioned once again that the<br>
exemplary embodiments described above with reference to<br>
the uplink can in principle also be used for the<br>
downlink. Furthermore, the present invention has been<br>
described above on the basis of the use in a mobile<br>
radio transmitter. The invention may, of course, also<br>
be extended, however, to mobile radio receivers, which<br>
shall be designed appropriately for reception and<br>
evaluation of a signal which is processed according to<br>
the invention and is then transmitted.<br>
