				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a novel stitching machine useful for the manufacture of mats/mattresses from non-conventional materials. The present invention particularly relates to a device for bonding loose fibres especially agro based materials. The novel stitching machine of the present invention may be a single or a multineedle stitching machine using single thread chainstitch for stitch bonding of loose fibre of coir and other bio-degradable agro-based waste material.<br>
The mat manufactured using the stitching machine of the present invention may be used as geo-textile to prevent soil erosion and land slide of hill slope. The stitching machine of the present invention provides stitch bonding which stabilizes or arrests the loose fibres sandwitched between lower and upper scrims of cloth, through the mechanism of chain stitch.<br>
The main usages of this invention is to provide stitch bonding to produce the following special purpose mats/mattresses.<br>
a)	The mats/mattresses manufactured using the stitching machine of the present<br>
invention may be used as geo-textile to prevent soil erosion and landslide of hill slope<br>
in which case the mats/mattresses shall be made out of bio-degradable agro-based<br>
waste.<br>
b)	The mattresses manufactured using the stitching machine of the present invention<br>
may be used as bed mattress (throw away type) in hospitals for communicable diseases<br>
and orthopedic patients.<br>
c)	Sandwitch-textiles made of jute-waste/other fibrous waste for shock absorbing<br>
rubberised pads in the field of sports may also be produced out of the stitching<br>
machine of the present invention.<br>
The prior art search reveals that there is no specific stitching machine available which is capable of producing special purpose mats/mattrresses from bio-degradable agro-waste material.<br>
Although there are several single/multi-needle stitching machines available, including industrial sewing machines, none of these are capable of stitch bonding of agrowaste<br><br>
material to produce mats/mattresses. Moreover, all industrial sewing machines are high speed machines which are suitable for stitching conventional materials and have been found to be unsuitable for stitch bonding of nonconventional materials such as bio-degradable agro-based waste materials.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a novel stitching machine useful for the manufacture of mats/mattresses from non-conventional materials which obviates the drawbacks as stated above.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a device for bonding loose fibres of agrowaste type materials for the production of mats/mattresses useful as geotextiles suitable to prevent landslides.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a device which can produce packaging mats for protecting consumer durables during transportation.<br>
Still another object of this invention is to provide devicce which can produce hospital as well as domestic mattress from a non-conventional agro-based material.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a device for the production of sport-cushion mattresses.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to invent a device which can produce straight pattern for chain stitch.<br>
In the drawings accompanying this specification fig.l shows the schematic view of the special type needle wherein the piercing end (1) of the needle is provided with a hook (2) and hinged latch (3) mechanism capable of closing the hook opening and a stem (4) for holding.<br>
In fig 2 of the drawings, the side view of the stitching machine is shown wherein the various parts are: Needle (1,2,3,4) Thread Fork (5)<br>
Guide Rollers (6) for feeding the material to be stitched.<br>
Spiked Chain conveyor mechanism (7,8)<br>
Horizontal Table (9) having pressure pad support,<br>
Indexing Mechanism (10) for providing intermittent movement to the sprocketed<br>
chain mechanism.Thread bobbin(l 1) mounted on stand.<br>
In fig 3 of the drawings the top view of an embodiment of a multi-needle stitching machine of the present invention is shown wherein the various parts are:<br>
Thread fork mounted movable sliding/follower bar (12) Needle holding frame (13) with vertical reciprocating mechanism Motor Gearbox assembly (14)<br>
The machine of the present invention essentially consists of following important modules:<br>
(I) Needle holding Frame with vertical reciprocating mechanism<br>
(ii) Thread fork mounted movable sliding/follower bar (iii) Spiked chain conveying mechanism<br>
 (iv) Horizontal table with pressure pad support<br>
The needle bar assembly consists of a frame (13) made of suitable material which holds plurality of needles at a required pitch distance. This nedle is special hook and latch type (Fig.l) which forms stitch loop. The needle bar with the plurality of needles clamped on it, moves up and down with the help of two swing levers attached to two grove cams mounted on the driving shaft which gets its motion from the electric motor through belt drive, reduction gear box (14)and chain drive. The follower bar assembly consists of a sliding bar(12) swingingly fitted with one or more thread fork (5) for plurality of special type of needles. The function of a thread fork is to hold and guide the thread coming from the bobbin (11) and move the thread such that it wraps around the needle(l,2,3) when the needle is at its top most position. As the thread is caught by the needle during its downward movement, the thread fork will return to its initial position. The required trajectory of movement of the thread<br>
Forks is achieved by means of plurality of cams fixed on the machine frame called thread bar, a pneumatic cylinder, a control valve and a plate cam fixed on the driving shaft.<br>
The spiked chain conveying (7, 8) system is used for intermittent movement of the mattress on the horizontal table (9), the amount of movement being equal to the specified distance between the seams along the length of the mattress. The stitches are formed when the mattress remains stationery. Loose threads of the stitches get tightened during the matters movement. A pairs of intermittently driven feed rollers (6)provides support to the raw mattress at its entry to the machine. Prior to entry into the set of rollers (5) the biowaste/equivalent fibres are uniformly distributed to a specified thickness in between two jute or equivalent support cloth scrim and folded at the two edges. The intermittent feed motion of the mat is caused by linear indexing of the plurality of spiked chains positioned below the mat. The spiked chains get their intermittent feed movement from the indexing mechanism (10 coupled to the driving shaft.<br>
The horizontal table (9) with pressure pad support is used to provide support to the mattress during stitching.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a A novel stitching machine useful for the manufacture of mats/mattresses from the non-conventional materials, cheracterised by one or more needle (s) (1,2,3,4) having a piercing end (1) with a hook (2), hinged latch (3) for closing the hook opening and a holding stem (4), the said holding stem of needle (s) being fixed by means on to a needle frame (13) for vertical reciprocating movement so as to enable thread fork (s) (5) to insert into the said hook (s) (2) by means of a thread fork mounted sliding/follower bar (12) a thread fed from a thread bobbin (s) (11) mounted on a stand above the said needle (s), the said needle (s) movement mechanism being adjustably fixed on to a main frame in such a manner so as to allow piercing of the threaded needle (s) through the material to be stitched being fed through plurality of guide roller (s) on to a horizontal table (9) having an intermittently movable spiked chain(s) conveyor mechanism (7,8), the said movements being powered by means of a motor gear box assembly (14).<br>
In an embodiment of the present inventions the horizontal table (9) being provided with pressure pad support having magnet(s) fixed onto it for closing needle hook latch(es) in the downward stroke.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the intermittent movement of the spiked chain conveyor mechanism (7,8) being provided by means of a conventional indexing mechanism (10).<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention scrim folding means being provided prior to the guide rollers.<br>
The electric motor drives the input shaft of a reduction gear box(14) through a pair of a pulleys and V-belts. A chain sprocket driving arrangement is provided in between the output end of the gear box and the drive shaft. The drive shaft is supported on two journal bearings fitted on the frames situated at left and right ends of the machine. An additional central support is also provided for the support of the long drive shaft. Two groove cams and one plate cam are mounted on the drive shaft. The indexing mechanism(l0) is also coupled to the drive shaft. The uniform rotational movement of the drive shaft is converted to reciprocating vertical movement of the needle bar(13) through the oscillating movement of the swing levers. The swing levers are pivoted on two brackets fitted to the left and right frames. The needle bar movement is guided along the frames with the help of guides which can be adjusted for required clearance. When the upward movement of the needle bar takes place, the indexing mechanism does not rotate as the indexing crank remains out of engagement with the indexing wheel.<br>
When the needle bar reaches the top most position, immediately then the plate cam (fixed on the left end of the drive shaft) triggers the control valve which opens and allows air to enter into the air cylinder. As a result, the piston moves the follower bar(12) to the extreme right position. The movement of the follower bar results in the forward movement of each thread fork(5) by the desired distance by means of wedge cams. The needle bar will dwell for some time at its top position followed by its downward movement. As the needle bar comes down to a certain distance, the control<br>
valve will close and the flow of air to the cylinder will be cut off. The piston along with the follower bar will slowly return to the initial position by means of a return spring. The speed of return movement can be adjusted by the throttle valve fitted on the cylinder. As the needle bar comes down, each needle will catch the thread and reach the bottom most position below the table(9). During downward movement of the needle, the needle latch(3) will come across a magnet fixed on the pressure pad and close which thereby prevents the displacement of the thread out of the needle. As the needle reaches the bottom, the indexing crank will get engaged with the indexing wheel and move all the chains(7) fitted with spikes. The chains(7) are fitted on sprockets(8) mounted on the conveyer shafts which are again mounted on suitable brackets fitted to the machine frames. At the bottom position, the needle bar will again dwell for sometime. The indexing wheel has multiple slots and hence, the movement will take place accordingly. The same cycle will repeat for each rotation of the drive shaft.<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration of the present invention and should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
Example-1<br>
The machine of the present invention with multiple needles was used to make mattress from paddy straw. The paddy straw was cut into small lengths of approximately 50 mm each and then spread on to a jute scrim uniformly. This was covered with another jute scrim and then all the open edges were stitched. The mat thus produced was stitch bonded on the machine of the present invention.<br>
Example-2<br>
The machine of the present invention was also similarly used to stitch bond a mat of approximately 25 mm thickness made out of coir fibres cut into short pieces of approximately 50 mm length.<br>
The same machine can be used to manufacture items of varying thicknesses less than 2 inches with stitches of variable lengths and variable spacings in between the rows of stitches.<br>
The main advantages of the present invention are :<br>
1. Mechanised method of bonding the loose fibres with the cloth/jute/plastic scrims to produce a mat/mattress.<br>
1. Simple method of bonding by chain stitch so that the fibres remain firmly in position to get a hard but flexible mattress.<br>
3.	Simple operation - even an unskilled operator with little training can operate the<br>
machine.<br>
4.	The machine consists of simple mechanism making it highly reliable and easily<br>
maintainable.<br>
5.	Automation/sequence control is achieved mechanically through simple cams<br>
resulting in consistent performance and trouble free operation.<br>
6.	The machine is of modular construction making assembly and dismantling of the<br>
components easy.<br>
7.	Rate of production can be increased reasonably by changing the speed ratio<br>
between the motor and gear box.<br>
8.	Mattress of any thickness less than 2 inches can be accommodated easily.<br>
9.	Effective utilisation of agrobased waste.<br><br>
10.	High value added variety of products for environmental, industrial and domestic<br>
use.<br>
11.	The same bonding technology can be used for the manufacture of low cost bed<br>
mattresses using agro-waste e.g. paddy straw, wheat straw etc. This machine can also<br>
be used for manufacturing packaging mats for protecting consumer durables during<br>
transportation.<br><br><br><br>
