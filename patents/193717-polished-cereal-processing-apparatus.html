				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for processing polished cereal such as polished rice to obtain no-bran cereal such as no-bran rice which requires no washing before cooking.<br>
2.	Description of Related Art<br>
Processed polished rice, i.e., no-bran rice which requires no wash before cooking is going to be brought into the market. The no-bran rice is obtained by removing bran including an aleurone layer which remains in grooves or concaves on grain surfaces of polished rice after subjected to polishing by a polishing machine. As a method of manufacturing the no-bran rice, there are known a method in which the polished rice as material is subjected to polishing in water for a minute time and then dehydrated to be dried, a method in which the polished rice is polished by a grinding brush to remove the remaining bran,<br>
and a "granular material mixing/stirring" method in which granular material as adhesive agent such as amyloid and grinded grain is mixed and stirred with the polished rice so that the granular material captures the remaining bran.<br>
FIG. 8 shows a polished rice processing apparatus 100 having a polished rice processing section 200 according to the "granular material mixing/stirring" method, as proposed in Indian Patent Application No. 316CAL2001. The polished rice processing section 200 includes a wet processing device 400 for softening the bran remaining on the surfaces of the material polished rice by stirring the material polished rice while adding moisture thereto, a thermal-<br>
-1A-<br><br>
adhesion material processing device 500 for adding pre-heated granular material to the polished rice so that the granular material captures the softened remaining bran, and a separating/drying device 600 for separating the processed polished rice from the granular material to obtain no-bran rice. The granular material separated by the separating/drying device 600 is collected and reprocessed by a granular material reprocessing section 300 for recycling and fed back to the thermal-adhesion material processing device 500.<br>
The granular material having predetermined granularity smaller than granularity of the material polished rice is used in the polished rice processing apparatus of the granular material mixing/stirring type so as to enable the separation of the processed polished rice from the granular material on the basis of the granularity by the separating/drying section 600 and also to effectively capture the bran remaining on the material polished rice. If the granular material separated by the separating/drying device 600 is directly fed back to the thermal-adhesion material processing device 500, size of the granular material gradually increases by the bran captured on the surface of the granular material, to make the separation of the processed polished rice and the granular material by the separating/drying section 600 incomplete to rise a problem of immixture of the granular material in the processed polished rice.<br>
Therefore, so as to recycle the granular material, it has been required to provide the granular material recycling section 300 as follows. The granular material recycling section 300 comprises a sifting device 700 for shifting the granular material separated by the separating/drying device 600 into a plurality of granularities, an abrading device 800 for abrading the bran from the surfaces of the granular material by passing a pair of rollers rotating in opposite directions, a drying device 900 for heating and drying the granular material with<br>
- 2 -<br><br>
the bran removed from the surfaces of the granular material by the abrading device 800 and the sifting device 700, and a conveying device 910 for feeding back the processed granular material to the thermal-adhesion material processing device 500. The granular material after processed by the granular material recycling section 300 having regulated granularity is securely separated from the processed polished rice by the separating/drying device 600 of the polished rice processing section 200.<br>
However, since the granular material recycling section 300 comprises the sifting device 700, the abrading device 800, the drying device 900 and the conveying device 910 to be separately installed, the size of the polished rice processing apparatus 100 has to be large.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to reduce a size of the granular material regeneration section to thereby make a whole size of the polished rice processing apparatus small.<br>
The polished cereal processing apparatus of the present invention comprises: a polished cereal processing section for removing bran remaining on<br>
surfaces of polished cereal by mixing granular material, such as herein described, with the polished cereal so that the remaining bran is captured by the granular material, and separating the polished cereal with bran removed and the granular material with bran<br>
captured; and a granular material reprocessing section for reprocessing the granular material with bran captured and feeding back the reprocessed granular material to the polished cereal processing section for recycling the granular material. The granular material reprocessing section includes a screen tube for<br>
- 3 -<br><br>
separating the granular material within a predetermined granularity range and a removing roller arranged to rotate in the screen tube for removing the bran captured on surfaces of the granular material fed into the screen tube.<br>
With the above arrangement, the bran captured on surfaces of the granular material is effectively removed by the rotation of the removing roller and the granular material with bran removed to have granularity within a predetermined range is separated by the screen tube and fed back to the polished cereal processing section for recycling the granular material. Since it is unnecessary to provide the abrading device and the sifting device in the prior art in the granular material reprocessing section, the granular material reprocessing section is made small.<br>
The cereal may be rice, wheat, barley corn, etc. As the granular material, edible granular material obtained by processing starch, such as cassava, to be pre-gelatinized and dried to form into small balls having predetermined uniform granularity such as pearl tapioca, and also grinded cereal such as grinded rice can be preferably used.<br>
The polished cereal processing section may comprise: a wet processing device for stirring the polished cereal while adding moisture thereto so as to soften the bran remaining on surfaces of the polished cereal; a thermal-adhesion material processing device for mixing and stirring the polished cereal processed by said wet processing device with preheated granular material so as to remove the softened bran on the surfaces of the polished cereal to be captured by the granular material; and a separating/drying device for drying the surfaces of the polished cereal processed by said thermal-adhesion material processing device and separating the polished cereal from the granular material. In the case of adopting the polished cereal processing section of above arrangement, the<br>
- 4 -<br><br>
granular material reprocessed by the granular material reprocessing section is fed back to the thermal-adhesion material processing device.<br>
By adopting the above arrangement of the polished cereal processing section, the softened bran remaining on the surfaces of the polished cereal is gelatinized immediately after touching with the preheated granular material (thermal-adhesion material) mixed and stirred with the polished cereal in the thermal-adhesion material processing device and is adhered to be captured by the granular material and removed from the surface of the polished rice with the aid of transfer of the moisture of the bran to the granular material. Then, the polished cereal with the bran removed and the granular material with bran removed are dried and separated by the separating/drying device.<br>
The granular material reprocessing section may comprise: a granular material regulating device for regulating the granularity of the granular material by removing the bran captured on the surfaces of the granular material; a drying device for drying the granular material regulated by the granular material regulating device, and a conveying device for conveying the regulated granular material to the polished cereal processing section.<br>
The bran captured on the surfaces of the granular material is removed by the removing roller and the removed bran and the granular material with bran removed are screened by the screen tube in the granular material regulating device. The screened granular material is dried by the drying device and conveyed to the polished cereal processing section. The granular material conveyed to the polished cereal processing section is suitable for reuse since it has regulated granularity and has heated by hot air supplied in the drying device.<br>
The granular material regulating device may comprise: an inlet for supplying the granular material into the screen tube; an outlet for discharging<br>
- 5 -<br><br>
granular material which has not passes through meshes of the screen tube; and a rotary shaft arranged in the screen tube for supporting the removing roller at an upstream side near the inlet and a discharge screw for feeding granular material remaining in said screen tube towards said outlet at a downstream side near the outlet. The meshes of the screen tube have a first mesh size to prevent the granular material of a predetermined granularity from passing through in a first region around the removing roller and a second mesh size to allow the granular material of the predetermined granularity to pass through in a second region around the discharge screw.<br>
The bran removed from the granular material by the rotation of the removing roller passes through the meshes in the first region having a first mesh size to be separated, and the granular material with bran removed to have the granularity within the predetermined range passed through the meshes in the second region having the second mesh si2e to be separated.<br>
The granular material regulating device may further comprise a feed screw fixed on the rotary shaft in the vicinity of the inlet to feed the granular material into the screen tube. In this case, the first region of meshes of said screen tube may extend to cover at least a part of the feed screw, so as to discharge fine grinded particles, etc. mixed in the granular material through meshes of the screen tube before the granular material reaches the removing<br>
roller.<br>
The granular material discharged from the outlet may be fed back to the<br>
Met so that the granular material with bran insufficiently removed is subjected to the removing action of the removing roller again to improve yield of reprocessing of the granular material.<br>
The removing roller may comprise a stirring roll having protrusions on<br>
- 6 -<br><br>
an outer circumference thereof for stirring the granular material in the screen tube. In this case, it is preferable that the screen tube has a polygonal cross section to improve effectiveness of removal action of the bran by the stirring roll.<br>
Alternatively, the removing roller may comprise an abrading roll for abrading the granular material in the screen tube. In this case, it is preferable that the screen tube has a circular cross section.<br>
The drying device may comprise a hot air generator and a blowing fan for supplying hot air blow, and the conveying device may comprise a conveying pipe communicating with the drying device and the polished cereal processing section for conveying the granular material regulated by the granular material regulating device to the polished cereal processing section by the hot air blow supplied from the drying device. With this structure, the regulated granular material is dried and heated by the hot air blow supplied from blowing fan while being conveyed in the conveying pipe by the hot air blow.<br>

An operation of the polished rice processing apparatus 1 will be described in detail.<br>
First, the polished rice processing section 2 will be explained. Material polished rice is supplied into the screw cylinder 11 from the supply cylinder 8 of the wet processing device 4. While supplying the material polished rice, moisture of approximately 5% of the material polished rice by weight is added to the material polished rice by the mist sprayed from the spray nozzle 13 arranged at the supply cylinder 8. The polished rice with moisture added is fed by rotation of the screw blade 11 and stirred by rotation of the stirring vanes 12 while being fed towards the distal end portion of the screw cylinder 7. In the stirring and feeding of the polished rice, bran remaining on grain surfaces of the polished rice absorbs the supplied moisture to be softened. A part of the bran is removed from the grain surfaces of the polished rice.<br>
The polished rice with the softened bran and the bran removed from the polished rice are fed into the screw cylinder 14 of the thermal-adhesion material<br>
- 15 -<br><br>
processing device 5 through the outlet cylinder 9 of the wet processing device 4. At the same time, the granular material stored in the hopper 14a is supplied into the screw cylinder 14 at the proximal portion thereof at a predetermined ratio of mixture (for example, 50% in weight). The granular material stored in the hopper 14a of the thermal-adhesion material processing device 5 has been dried and heated by the drying device 46 of the granular material reprocessing section 3 and has a temperature of 70°C-100°C.<br>
The granular material has high moisture-retaining, high moisture-absorbing and high adhesive characteristics. It is preferable to use edible granular material, such as pearl tapioca, obtained by processing starch, such as cassava, to be pre-gelatinized and dried to form into small balls having hardness of 2-5 kgf/cm2 and predetermined uniform granularity. Further, grinded cereal such as grinded rice as edible material can be adopted as the granular material.<br>
The granular material, the polished rice with the softened bran and the bran removed from the polished rice are stirred and mixed in the screw cylinder 14 by the stirring vanes 18 while being fed towards the distal end portion of the screw cylinder 14 by the screw blade 17.<br>
The bran remaining on the grain surface of the polished rice is gelatinized immediately after touching with the heated granular material and is adhered to be captured by the granular material and removed from the grain surface of the polished rice with the aid of transfer of the moisture of the bran to the granular material. The bran already removed from the grain surfaces of the polished rice is also captured by the granular material.<br>
The polished rice with bran removed and the granular material with bran captured are fed into the screen cylinder 25 of the separating/drying device 6 through the outlet cylinder 15 and are fed towards the distal end portion of the<br>
- 16 -<br><br>
screen cylinder 19 by the screw blade 22 and stirred by the stirring vanes 24. At the same time, dry air is supplied from the air supply opening 26 to dry the polished rice and the granular material. The granular material with bran captured falls through meshes of the screen cylinder 25 to be separate from the polished rice with bran removed. The polished rice with bran removed (no-bran rice) is fed to the processed polished rice outlet 20 and discharged outside.<br>
Function of the granular material reprocessing section 3 will be described referring to FIG. 3. The granular material separated from the processed polished rice by the separating/drying device 6 is supplied to the supply tank 33 of the granular material reprocessing device 45 by the conveyer 33a. The granular material supplied from the supply tank 33 is fed to a position of the screen tube 3 8 having the first mesh size by the rotation of the feed screw 30 and fine particles mixed in the granular material fall through meshes of the first mesh size of the screen tube 38 and removed. When the granular material reaches the removing roller 34, the granular material is stirred by the protrusions 42b of the stirring roll 42 which is rotating in the counterclockwise direction so that the bran captured on the grain surfaces of the granular material is separated and removed from the grain surfaces by friction acting between respective grains and pressing force against inner faces of the screen tube 38, in the case of removing roller 34 in the form of the stirring roll 42 and the screen tube 38 in the form of polygonal prism as shown in FIG. 4. With the rotation of the stirring roll 42 in the counterclockwise direction, pressure at a fixed position in a chamber between the screen tube 38 and the stirring roll 42 gradually increases by variation of thickness of the cylindrical body 42 a and suddenly decreases immediately after the protrusion 42b passes. This variation of pressure provides sufficient stirring effects on the granular material in the<br>
- 17 -<br><br>
chamber between the screen tube 38 and the stirring roll 42.<br>
In the case of the removing roller 34 in the form of the abrading roll 43 and the screen tube 38' in the form of cylinder, as shown in FIG. 5, the bran adhered on the grain surfaces are separated and removed mainly by abrasion in contact with the abrading roll 43 rotating in the clockwise or the counterclockwise direction. In the above examples, the removing roller 34 is rotated at 300-800 r.p.m. with the rotary shaft 29 and the pressure of approximately 2Ggf/cm2 is applied to the granular material between the screen tube 38' and the removing roller 34.<br>
The bran removed from the grain surfaces of the granular material falls through the meshes of the first mesh size of the screen tube 38' and corrected by the outlet funnel 40 to be discharged from the granular material reprocessing device 45 and packaged for specific use.<br>
The granular material with bran removed is fed to a position of the discharge screw 36 and screened by the screen tube 39 having the second mesh size so that grains under the predetermined granularity fall through the screen tube 39 and corrected by the funnel 41. The granular material remaining in the second screen tube 39 is fed to the outlet 35 and fed back to the supply tank 33 by the conveyer 35a since removal of the bran on the surfaces of these grains by the separating roll 34 is insufficient.<br>
The granular material corrected by the outlet funnel 41 is conveyed by the conveyer 46a to the storage tank 48 of the drying device 46 shown in FIG. 6. The granular material in the storage tank 48 gradually flow down, to enter into the granular material flowing paths 52 by the periodical rotation of the rotary valves 55. The hot air of 100°C-120°C supplied to the hot air supplying chamber 53 lows through the grains of the granular material in the granular<br>
- 18 -<br><br>
material flowing paths 52 and discharged out of the drying device 46 through the air discharge openings 54a. The granular material in the granular material flowing paths 52 flows down while receiving the hot air to be dried and enters into the slant portion 56 by the rotary valves 55, taking approximately ten minutes , The granular material collected by the slant portion 56 is fed out of the drying device 46 by the bottom screw 57 and conveyed by the conveying device 47 to the thermal-adhesion material processing device 5 at the temperature of approximately 100°C. It takes approximately one hour for the granular material to pass through the storage tank 48 and the hot air drying part 49. New granular material is fed into the storage tank 48 from the granular material supplement device 65 to be used in mixed with the reprocessed granular material.<br>
In the case of adopting the hot air conveying device 64 as a combination of the drying device for drying the granular material and the conveying device for conveying the dried granular material, the hot air of 100° C-120° C is supplied to the conveying pipe 63 from the hot air blower 62 for blowing and conveying the granular material. The granular material fed into the conveying pipe 63 through the rotary valve 59 is blown and conveyed by the hot air to be dried while conveying in the conveying pipe 63. The granular material when fed to the thermal-adhesion material processing section 5 has a temperature of approximately 100°C. With this hot air conveying device 64, the drying device 46 as shown in FIG. 6 is made unnecessary and the polished rice processing apparatus 1 can be further reduced in size.<br>
According to the above-described polished rice processing apparatus of the present invention, the bran captured on surfaces of the granular material is effectively removed and the granular material with the bran removed to have<br>
- 19 -<br><br>
predetermined granularity suitable for recycling is obtained by screening by the granular material regulating device of the granular material reprocessing section, to make it unnecessary to provide an abrading device and a sifting device which have been conventionally required to arrange separately. Thus, the granular material reprocessing section is downsized to reduce the whole size of the polished rice processing apparatus.<br>
