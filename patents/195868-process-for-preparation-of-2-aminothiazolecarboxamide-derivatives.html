2-bromo-N-( α -cyano-2-thenyl)acetamide(2.6g, O.Olmol) were dissolved in methanol(20m(0- And then triethylamine(1.5g, 0.02mol) was introduced therein, and the mixture was stirred at the temperature of 60°C for 7 hours.<br>
After the reaction was completed, the solvent was removed by distillation under reduced pressure to produce a brown solid. The solid was recrystallized from the mixture solution of ethanbl and water (v/v=l/l) to give the title compound(2.0g, O.Olmol) in a yield of 60%.<br>
1H NMR (CDC13) : δ7.38(1H, d), 7.30(1H, d), 7.01(1H, t), 6.44(1H, d), 6.00(1H, d), 5.49(1H, s, br), 3.61(1H, m), 2.91(2H, q), 1.27(9H, m)<br>
