				<td>The present invention relates to a process for polymerizing ethylenlcally unsaturated monomers, and the use of 1-alkoxy-polyalkyi piperidine derivatives for controlled polymerization. The intermediate N-oxyi derivatives, a composition of the N-oxyl derivatives with ethylenlcally unsaturated monomers and a free radical initiator X.<br>
The compounds of the present invention provide polymeric resin products having low polydispersity. The polymerization process proceeds with enhanced monomer to polymer conversion efficiency. In particular, this invention relates to stable free radical- mediated polymerization processes which provide homopolymers, random copolymers, block copolymers, muitiblock copolymers, graft copolymers and the like, at enhanced rates of polymerization and enhanced monomer to polymer conversions.<br>
Polymers or copolymers prepared by free radical polymerization processes inherentiy have broad molecular weight distributions or polydispersities which are G6nerally higher than about four. One reason for this is that most of the free radical initiators have half lives that are relatively long, ranG1ng from several minutes to many hours, and thus the polymeric chains are not ail initiated at the same time and the initiators provide growing chains of various lengths at any time during the polymerization process. Another reason is that the propagating chains in a free radical process can react with each other in processes known as combination and disproportionation, both of which are irreversibly chain-terminating reaction processes. In doing so, chains of varying lengths are terminated at different times during the reaction process, resulting in resins consisting of polymeric chains which vary widely in length from very small to very larG6 and which thus have broad polydispersities. If a free radical polymerization process is to be used for producing narrow molecular weight distributions, then all polymer chains must be initiated at about the same time and termination of the growing polymer-chains by combination or disproportionation processes must be avoided.<br>
Conventional radical polymerization reaction processes pose various significant problems, such as difficulties in predicting or controlling the molecular weight, the polydispersity and<br><br>
the modality of the polymers produced. These prior art polymerization processes produce polymers having broad polydispersities and in some instances, low polymerization rates . Furthermore, free radical polymerization processes in bulk of the prior art are difficult to control because the polymerization reaction is strongly exothermic and an efficient heat removal in the highly viscous polymer is mostly impossible. The exothermic nature of the prior art free radical polymerization processes often severely restricts the concentration of reactants or the reactor size upon scale-up.<br>
Due to the above mentioned uncontrollable polymerization reactions, G6l formation in conventional free radical polymerization processes are also possible and cause broad molecular weight distributions and/or difficulties during filtering, drying and manipulating the product resin.<br>
US-A-4 581 429 to Solomon et al., issued April 8,1986, discloses a free radical polymeriza¬tion process which controls the growth of polymer chains to produce short chain or oligo-meric homopolymers and copolymers, including block and graft copolymers. The process employs an initiator having the formula (in part) R"R" N-O-X, where X is a free radical species capable of polymerizing unsaturated monomers. The reactions typically have low conversion rates. Specifically mentioned radical R"R"N-O groups are derived from 1,1,3,3 tetraethylisoindoline, 1,1,3,3 tetrapropylisoindoline, 2,2,6,6 tetramethylpiperidine, 2,2,5,5 tetramethylpyrrolidine or di-t-butylamine. However, the sugG6sted compounds do not fulfill all ^ requirements. Particularly the polymerization of acrylates does not proc^eec^fast eriough and/or the monomer to polymer conyersion is not as high as desired.<br>
Recently other attempts to develop new polymerization regulators have been published. WO 98/4408 and WO 98/30601 disclose heterocyclic compounds suitable for controlled polymerization processes. WO 98/13392 discloses open chain alkoxyamines which are derived from NO gas or from nitroso componds.<br>
EP-A-J735g52 discloses a method for preparing thermoplastic polymers of narrow poly¬dispersities by free radical-initated polymerization, which comprises adding a free radical initiator and a stable free radical aG6nt to the monomer compound.<br>
This method has the disadvantaG6 that uncontrollable recombinations of initiator radicals may occur immediately after their formation, thus producing variable ratios between initiator<br><br>
radicals and stable free radicals. Consequently in some cases there is no good control of the polymerization process.<br>
There is therefore still a need for polymerization processes for the preparation of narrow polydispersity polymeric resins with defined molecular weights using the economical free radical polymerization techniques. These polymerization processes will also control the /physical properties of the polymers such as viscosity, hardness, G6l content, processability, clarity, high gloss, durability, and the like.<br>
The polymerization processes and resin products of the present invention are useful in many<br>
applications, including a variety of specialty applications, such as for the preparation of block<br>
copolymers which are useful as compatibilizing aG6nts for polymer blends, or dispersing<br>
aG6nts for coating systems or for the preparation of narrow molecular weight resins or	A^^^<br>
oligomers for use in coating technoloG1es and thermoplastic films or as toner resins and liquid immersion development ink resins or ink additives used for electrophotographic       " imaG1ng processes.<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that it is possible to overcome the afore mentioned shortcomings of the prior art by providing a polymerizable composition containing specifjc initiator compounds. Polymerization of the composition results in a polymer or copolymer of narrow polydispersity and a high monomer to polymer conversion even at relatively low temperatures and at short reaction times, making the polymerization process particularly suitable for industrial applications. The resulting copolymers are of high purity and in many cases colorless, therefore not requiring any further purification.<br>

More preferably the scission of the O-C bond is effected by heating and takes place at a temperature of between 50°C and 160°C.<br><br>
The process may be carried out in the presencejof an organic solvent or in the presence of water or in mixtures of organic solvents and water. Additional cosolvents or surfactants, such as glycols or ammonium salts of fatty acids, may be present. Other suitable cosolvents are described hereinafter.<br>
Preferred processes use as little solvents as possible, In the reaction mixture it is preferred to use more than 30% by weight of monomer and initiator, particularly preferably more than 50% and most preferrably more than 80%.<br>
If organic solvents are used, suitable solvents or mixtures of solvents are typically pure alkanes (hexane, heptane, octane, isooctane), hydrocarbons (benzene, toluene, xylene), fialogenated hydrocarbons (chlorobenzene), alkanols (methanol, ethanol, ethylene glycol, ethylene glycol monomethyl ether), esters (ethyl acetate, propyl, butyl or hexyl acetate) and   ethers (diethyl ether, dibutyl ether, ethylene glycol dimethyl ether), or mixtures thereof.<br>
The aqueous polymerization reactions can be supplemented with a water-miscible or hydrophilic cosolvent to help ensure that the reaction mixture remains a homogenep,us single phase throughout the monorner conversion. Any water-soluble or water-miscible cosolvent may be used, as long as the aqueous solvent medium is effective in providing a solvent system which prevents precipitation or phase separation of the reactants or polymer products until after all polymerization reactions have been completed. Exemplary cosolvents useful in the present invention may be selected from the group consisting of aliphatic alcohols, glycols, ethers, glycol ethers, pyrrolidines, N-alkyI pyrrolidinones, N-alkyI pyrrolidones, polyethylene glycols, polypropylene glycols, amides, carboxylic acids and salts   thereof, esters, organosulfides, sulfoxides, sulfones, alcohol derivatives, hydroxyether derivatives such as butyl carbitol or celiosolve, amino alcohols, ketones, and the like, as well as derivatives thereof and mixtures thereof. Specific examples include methanol, ethanol, propanol, dioxane, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, diethylene glycol, glycerol, dipropylene glycol, tetrahydrofuran, and other water-soluble or water-miscible materials, and mixtures thereof. When mixtures of water and water-soluble or water-miscible organic liquids are selected as the aqueous reaction media, the water to cosolvent weight ratio is typically in the range of about 100:0 to about 10:90.<br>
The process is particularly useful for the preparation of block copolymers.<br><br><br>
Block copolymers are, for example, block copolymers of polystyrene and polyacrylate (e.g., poiy(styrene-co-acrylate) or poly(styrene-co-acrylate-co-styrene). They are usefull as adhesives or as compatlbilizers for polymer blends or as polymer toughening aG6nts. Poly(methylmethacrylate-co- acrylate) diblock copolymers or poly(methylacrylate-co-acrylate-co-methacrylate) triblock copolymers) are useful as dispersing aG6nts for coating systeme, as coating additives (e.g. rheoloG1cal aG6nts, compatlbilizers, reactive diluents) or as resin component in coatings(e.g. high solid paints) Block copolymers of styrene, (meth)acrylates and/or acrylonitrile are useful for plastics, elastomers and adhesives.<br>
Furthermore, block copolymers of this invention, wherein the blocks alternate between polar monomers and non-polar monomers, are useful in many applications as amphiphilic surfactants or dispersants for preparing highly uniform polymer blends, he (co)polymers of the present invention may have a number averaG6 molecular weight om 1 000 to 400 000 g/mol, preferably from 2 000 to 250 000 g/mol and, more preferably, om 2 000 to 200 000 g/mol. When produced in bulk, the number averaG6 molecular weight lay be up to 500 000 (with the same minimum weights as mentioned above). The number veraG6 molecular weight may be determined by size exclusion chromatography (SEC), G6l ermeation chromatography (GPC), matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization mass Dectrometry (MALDI-MS) or, if the initiator carries a group which can be easily distinguished om the monomer(s), by NMR spectroscopy or other conventional methods.<br>
he polymers or copolymers of the present invention have preferably a polydispersity of from 0 to 2, more preferably of from 1.1 to 1.9 and most preferably from 1.2 to 1.8.<br>
1US, the present invention also encompasses in the synthesis novel block, multi-block, star, adient, random, hyperbranched and dendritic copolymers, as well as graft or copolymers.<br>
ie polymers prepared by the present invention are useful for following applications:<br>
ihesives, deterG6nts, dispersants, emulsifiers, surfactants, defoamers, adhesion pro-oters, corrosion inhibitors, viscosity improvers, lubricants, rheology modifiers, thickeners, osslinkers, paper treatment, water treatment, electronic materials, paints, coatings, photo-aphy, ink materials, imaG1ng materials, superabsorbants, cosmetics, hair products, preser-itives, biocide materials or modifiers for asphalt, leather, textiles, ceramics and wood.<br><br>
Because the present polymerizaton is a "living" polymerization, it can be started and stopped practically at wjll Eurtherrriore, the polymer product retains the functional alkoxyamine group allowing a continuation of the polymerization in a living.matter. Thus, in one embodiment of :his invention, once the first monomer is consumed in the initial polymerizing step a second Tionomer can then be added to form a second block on the growing polymer chain in a second polymerization step. Therefore it is possible to carry out additional polymerizations with the same or different monomer(s) to prepare multi-block copolymers, furthermore, since this is a radical polymerization, blocks can be prepared in essentially any )rder. One is not necessarily restricted to preparing block copolymers where the sequential )olymerizing steps must flow from the least stabilized polymer intermediate to the most stabilized polymer intermediate, such as is the case in ionic polymerization. Thus it is )ossible to prepare a multi-block copolymer in which a polyacrylonitrile or a poly(meth)-icrylate block is prepared first, then a styrene or butadiene block is attached thereto, and so )n.<br>
urthermore, there is no linking group required for joining the different blocks of the present )lock copolymer. One can simply add successive monomers to form successive blocks.<br>
 plurality of specifically designed polymers and copolymers are accessible by the present ivention, such as star and graft (co)polymers as described, inter alia, by C. J. Hawker in nG6w.

B) Polymerizations using compounds of Table 1 or their N-0. precursors as initiators<br>
G6neral remarks:<br>
Solvents and monomers are distilled over a Vigreux column under argon atmosphere or under vacuum, shortly before being used.<br>
To remove oxyG6n all polymerization reaction mixtures are flushed before polymerization with argon and evacuated under vaccum applying a freeze-thaw cycle. The reaction mixtures are then polymerized under argon atmosphere.<br>
At the start of the polymerization reaction, all starting materials are homoG6neously dissolved.<br>
Conversion is determined by removing unreacted monomers from the polymer at 80°C and 0.002 torr for 30j7iinutes , weighing the remaining polymer and subtract the weight of the initiator.<br>
