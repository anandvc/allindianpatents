				<td>Field of invention<br>
The present  invention relates to a process for the preparation of inactivated plant lipases . More particularly, the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of inactivated wheat germ and rice bran lipases using selected biomolecules.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
The rice grain contains 2-3% fat, most of which is concentrated in the embryo or germ and in the outer seed layers. Milling of rice separates the germ and bran layers from the endosperm and concentrates the fat in the residue commonly known as "bran" which contains 10-26% oil. Although rice bran has considerable potential as a contributor to world oil supply, it is seldom considered in the list of edible oil raw material sources.<br>
Rice bran oil is seen as a superior oil, rich in vitamins and low in ingredients responsible for cholesterol. Rice bran oil can play a significant role in augmenting India's domestic vegetable oil supply. Despite being a leader in rice production, India still has a long way to go in the recovery of good quality rice bran to produce food-grade oil. If properly harnessed, rice bran - an important byproduct of the rice milling industry - can be used to augment the domestic edible oil supply. The prime draw back of rice bran as a source of edible oil is associated with its deterioration in storage, principally, as a result of hydrolysis of oil by lipolytic enzymes present in the bran. The lipolytic activity is observed as soon as the bran is removed from the rice and lipolysis continues with prolonged storage , yielding high levels of free fatty acids in the oil, which becomes unsuitable for processing to an edible oil. In India, time delay between milling<br><br>
and oil extraction is responsible for increases of the free fatty acid content from 2.5-3.0% in the freshly milled bran to beyond 10% which results in high refining losses. Therefore, a number of approaches have been employed to arrest the lipolysis in the bran and the process termed "stabilization of rice bran" uses cumbersome and very expensive methods. Several designs such as chemical, mechanical and thermal, have been attempted. The investigation of the effect of heating or drying and the effect of different relative humidities on the storage of rice bran have shown that rice bran can be stored for periods of at least four months without excessive increase in the content of free fatty acids.<br>
An increase in the moisture content of predried bran causes a rapid increase in the free fatty acid content of the oil. Another approach to combat this problem is sterilization of bran at elevated temperatures and moistures to retard the action of the enzyme sufficiently to permit the storage of the bran with no rise in free fatty acid for reasonable lengths of time . A practical solution to the stabilization of rice bran is to store the material at low temperature. Other methods to stabilize rice bran like gamma irradiation or chemicals or microwave heating generally have not been successful.<br>
Studies also have shown that methanol at 2% v/w and concentrated HCI spray could not arrest the release of free fatty acid from the rice bran oil in comparison to other organic solvents and mineral acids. In addition, the methanol or HCI in the presence of metal ions did not influence the oil content of rice bran during storage. There are also reports that Fe3+ and Ni2+ could be effectively used to arrest the release of free fatty acids in rice bran and thus contribute to improving the edible oil quality of rice bran oil. However, the feasibility of using metal ion and/or solvent-treated rice bran<br><br>
in the processing of food for human consumption is rather difficult in the absence of any metabolic study. Therefore, many a times, enzymes such as lipase which are undesirable in food systems need to be inactivated and hence the improved methods of stabilization of rice bran for the production of food-grade rice bran oil.<br>
In the case of wheat, the lipase activity is found to be located in the bran component of the grain(75-80%) and significant activity was also present in the germ(20-25%) . The presence of lipase activity is of both economic and nutritional importance due to its role in the oxidative rancidity. The major cause of this deterioration is thought to be due to the degradation of cereal lipids. In wheat, this appears to be initiated by the lipase-catalysed hydrolysis of triacylglycerols to unesterified fattyacids with increasing storage time.<br>
Lipases ( triacylglycerol acyl hydrolases, EC 3.1.1.3 ) constitutes one of the structurally less characterized families of hydrolases. The natural substrates of lipases are triacylglycerols having very low solubility in water. They hydrolyze the ester bonds in tri, di and monoacylglycerols, although some are known to degrade fairly broad range of compounds containing an ester linkage.<br>
Lipase activity has been identified in a wide range of oilseeds. In oilseeds, containing 20-50% lipids(mainly triacylglycerols) as storage material, it is obvious that lipase action is essential in germination when reserve(insoluble) triacylglycerols are converted to soluble sugars which can be transported to the growing embryos to supply carbon and energy.<br>
Oil seed lipases from diverse plant species exhibit differences in their substrates, pH optimum ,and reactivity towards sulfhydryl reagents, hydrophobicity and subcellular<br><br>
location. Seed lipase from a certain plant species is relatively specific for the native triacylglycerols or triacylglycerol containing the major fatty acids of the storage triacylglycerols of the same species.With the exception of castorbean lipase, the lipase activities are very minimal or absent in ungerminated seeds and are found to increase after germination. In rapeseed and mustard seed, the lipase is more active in germinated seed as compared to ungerminated seed. True lipases, which attack the fatty acyl linkage of water-insoluble triacylglycerols, are known to occur in oilseeds and grains. In postgerminative growth, the oil reserve is rapidly mobilized to provide energy and skeletons for the growth of the embryo. The triacylglycerols are localized in subcellular glyoxysomal membrane and contains an acyl hydrolyze/true lipase. In seeds where the lipase is found in subcellular compartments other than the lipid bodies, the enzymes still have to come in contact with membrane of the lipid bodies during catalysis. Fatty acids liberated due to the action of lipolytic enzymes are water-insoluble and its removal from the lipid bodies is of prime importance and essential for the continuation of the lipdlysis in the plant. There are several possible mechanisms for the transport of fatty acids. The important among them is the membrane flow mechanism. The fatty acids are released by the action of lipases on the lipid body membrane and flow along the membrane by a simple diffusion through the contact junction of the two organelles due to a concentration gradient to the membrane of the glyoxysome, similar to the one proposed for the mamalian systems. The physiological role of the glyoxisomal lipase in lipolysis has not been substantiated but still there exists a possibility that it is involved in the transport of fatty acids. Lipase activity plays an important role in the germination and postgermination growth of oilseeds where stored<br><br>
triacylglycerols are used in the first reaction of the gluconeogenic pathway. In tissues other than leaves, alterations of membrane lipids occur in development and differentiation such as during seed maturation and germination and fruit ripening. The released free fatty acids which are the source of rancidity as in the case of rice bran , from the enzymatic reaction may undergo oxidation catalyzed by oxidases to produce volatile and nonvolatile metabolites that may be of normal nature.<br>
All lipases consists of a catalytic triad of His-Ser- Asp/Glu, reminiscent of serine proteases. The defining characteristic of lipases is the phenomenon termed " interfacial activation " which is caused by a change of its conformation resulting from adsorption. Many industrial fronts have shifted towards utilizing this enzyme for a variety of reaction of immense importance in dairy, pharmaceutical, agrochemical and industries due to its efficiency to catalyze a variety of esterification and transesterification reaction.<br>
Biomolecules, such as chlorogenic acid(CGA) ,caffeic acid(CA) and quinic acid(QA) play a significant role in many biological and metabolic processes like inhibition of lipoxygenase activity in prostaglandin metabolism, inhibition of retinoic acid 5,6- epoxidation and hydroxyl radical formation, antiviral activity and interaction with DNA. These multifunctional nature of the above selected biomolecules show that they act differently depending upon the biological processes. CGA is present in large quantities in coffee, tea and in many oil seeds in complex with proteins, and is rapidly converted to CA and QA by breakage of the ester bond between them. The CA moiety is more dominant and the principle active group in CGA which has been shown with the<br>
intestinal motility action in rats induced by these compounds. The result of this work is analyzed from the point of view of stabilization or destabilization effect on lipases.<br>
Reference may be made to O'Connor. J, Harwood, J.L . Solubilization and purification of membrane-bound lipases from wheat flour. J. Cereal. Sci. 16, 141-152(1992), wherein the effect of a variety of metal ions and enzyme inhibitors on lipase preparations were evaluated, with a view to suggesting a means of controlling their activities and showed, the addition of 100 mM NaCI to whole flour samples caused a 55% reduction in total -lipese activity, whilst treatment of flour with 100 mM NaCI before solubilization caused a complete loss in activity. However the drawback of the invention was inhibitor used at very high concentration.The influence of addition of 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10µ M of benzoic and cinnamic acids and selected phenolic acids like salicylic, p-hydroxybenzoic, gentisic, protocatechuic, vanillic, syringic, o-coumaric, p-coumaric, caffeic, ferulic, sinapic on the activity of pancreatic lipase was examined in vitro. The strongest inhibition activities were observed with caffeic, ferulic and benzoic acid, while sinapic and gentisic acids produced the lowest inhibition( Karamac M and Amarowicz R, 1996. Inhibition of pancreatic lipase by phenolic acids-Examination in vitro. Z Naturforsch., 51(11-12), 903-905).<br>
The inhibitory effect of caffeic acid analogues isolated from Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix were examined and found that the free radical 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl(DPPH) inhibited by the polymers of caffeic acid is more than caffeic acid.<br>
The strongest activity was displayed by two tetramers, lithospermic acid B and its Mg 2+ salt. The inhibitory effect of caffeic acid derivatives revealed that the o-dihydroxyl group was the most important active structure of caffeic acid derivatives for scavanging of free radicals. The saturated group connected to the aromatic ring has slightly higher inhibitory activity against the DPPH radical than an unsaturated group( Chen C.P., Yokozawa T and Chung H Y. 1999. Inhibitory effect of caffeic acid analogues isolated from Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix against 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical. Exp Toxicol Pathol 51(1), 59-63).The chlorogenic acid was found to be the inhibitor on the basis of UV and mass spectra and comparison with a standard sample. The inhibition of caffeic acid was also checked in 8-OH-dg formation in animal organs, an oxygen radical forming carcinogen,4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide( kasai H, Fukada, . S, Yamaizumi, Z, Sugie, S and Mori H. 2000. Action of chlorogenic acid in vegetables and fruits as an inhibitor of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine formation in vitro and in a Rat carcinogenis Model. Food and Chemical Toxicology, 38, 467-471).The haematin and haemoglobin-catalysed retinoic 5,6-epoxidation were inhibited by chlorogenic acid and caffeic acid suggesting that the o-hydroquinone moiety of chlorogenic acid and caffeic acid is essential to the inhibition of the epoxidation. However caffeic acid does not inhibit the formation of retinoic acid radicals but does inhibit the step of conversion of retinoic acid radical into the 5,6-epoxide( Iwahashi, H,<br>
Negoro, Y, Ikeda.A, Morishita,H and Kido.R. 1986. Inhibition of chlorogenic acid of haematin-catalysed retinoic acid 5,6-epoxidation. Biochem. J. 239, 641-646).<br>
A, chlorogenic acid, which is an ester of caffeic acid and quinic acid, inhibited the N-nitrosation of a 2,3-diaminonaphthalene by the N-nitrosating agent produced by nitrite in acidic solution. Caffeic acid was also inhibited the N-nitrosation. The observations showed that the mechanism by which chlorgenic acid inhibited N-nitrosation of 2,3 -diamino-naphthalene is due to its ability to scavenge the nitrosating agent, nitrogen sesquioxide and inhibition is effective not only in protecting against oxidative damage but also in inhibiting potentially mutagenic and carcinogenic reactions( Kono Y, Shibatg H, Kodama Y and sana Y 1995 The supressinn of the N- niuoing reactic: chlorogenic acid . Biochem. J. 312, 94 - 3).<br>
Polyphenols and their relate	oounds inhibit    overall fonnation oi    '3-<br>
hydroperoxide ctadecadienoic acid,(HPLC-ESR) derived radicals in the reaction mixture of 13-(HPLC-ESR) in ferrous ions were examined by ESR . On the other hand the high performance quid chromatography- electron spin resonance(HPLC-ESR) and the high performance liquid chromatography- electron spin resonance -mass spectrometries(HPLC-ESR-MS) showed that caffeic acid inhibited the formation of octanoic acid radical and pentyl radical and results showed that the chelation of ferrous ion is responsible to the inhibitory effects of the polyphenols( Iwahashi, H. 2000. Some polyphenols inhibit the formation of pentyl radical and octanoic acid radical in the<br>
reaction mixture of linoleic acid hydroperoxide with ferrous ions. Biochem. J. 345, 265-273).<br>
There is lot of information available on the inhibition by biomolecules and chlorogenic acid in particular. But the information on the inhibition of plant lipases by biomolecules is meagre.<br>

The reaction mixture was checked for remaining enzyme activity by pH-stat method using Mettler Toledo DL12 titrator titrating against 0.05M NaOH . Respective blank solutions where the enzyme was inactivated by the addition of distilled alcohol was also used. The remaining activity was expressed as microequivalents of alkali consumed per mg of protein per hour.<br>
The novelty and the uniqueness of the process of the invention is the inactivation of both wheat germ lipase and rice bran lipase using selected biomolecules such as chlorogenic acid and caffeic acid.<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration of the present invention and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.   EXAMPLE -1  (Example Removed)<br><br>
In order to understand the effect of biomolecules on the activity of plant lipases such as wheat germ lipase and rice bran lipase , experiments were carried out at various concentrations of biomolecules.<br>
The activity of wheat germ lipase in the presence of chlorogenic acid was checked at 1;50 mole to mole ratio of protein to ligand using 4ml of the 5% substrate and 10 µl of 0.1 M CaCI2.<br>
The analysis of the data showed that the enzyme was found to loss 10% of initial activity in presence of 1:50 mole to mole ratio of protein to ligand.<br>
