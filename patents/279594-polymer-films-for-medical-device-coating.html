RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001]  This application claims the benefit of priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 60/940,365 filed May 25, 2007 and U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 60/979,375 filed October 11, 2007. The disclosure of these applications are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]  Medical devices often must be shielded from interacting with body fluids in vivo. For example, for devices that are electrical in nature, for example, such as pacemakers and other "active" implants for sensing, delivery of therapeutics and/or active control of various bodily functions should be protected.<br>
[0003] One prevalent method used to provide this protection is to weld the device inside a titanium or other biocompatible metal "can." Another method to provide the shield necessary to protect a medical device from interaction with bodily fluids in vivo is polymer coating the device. Polymer coating such "active" implants has significant technical challenges and limitations which have made polymer coatings relatively unsuccessful as a means of sealing the devices.<br>
[0004]  For example, one limitation of traditional coating processes in providing a seal is that traditional polymer coating processes (e.g. dip, spray, etc.) all require the use of a solvent-based system. Exposing the device to a solvent causes problems in the device. Furthermore, there are inherent challenges with effective drying of solvent-based polymer coatings.<br>
[0005]  Solvent-less coating processes (e.g. vapor deposition, plasma deposition, dry powder coating, etc.) also have limitations in providing seals to active devices. Solvent-less coating processes all require very aggressive conditions that could damage the device - such as elevated temperatures to cure a dry powder coated device.<br>
[0006] Additionally, for most current coating technologies, solvent-based and solvent-less, it is often difficult to achieve coatings of uniform thicknesses and prevent the occurrence of defects (e.g. bare spots, webs, pools, clumps). As the size of the substrate decreases, and as the mechanical complexity increases, it grows increasingly difficult to uniformly coat all surfaces of a substrate. Supplemental steps, therefore, are sometimes necessary to assure proper coating, including, for example, multiple coating steps and/or drying between or after the coating steps (in solvent-based systems). [0007]  Conventional polymer films likewise have limitations in providing a seal. Conventional polymer films are known to be quite ineffective barriers to the transport of gaseous materials. While this is especially true of small molecule gases, the problem extends to providing a barrier to water vapors and other gases that could deleteriously effect an electrical biomedical implant.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0008]  A cost-effective, easy to apply polymer-based coatings and coating methods to seal a substrate, where the collection process on the substrate is efficient, the coating produced is conformal, substantially defect-free and uniform, and the composition of the coating can be regulated and controlled is provided herein. The method and coatings provide a seal which is impermeable and/or imperveous to gas and/or fluid. The seal can be applied to a variety of substrates, including, but not limited to, implantable medical devices that are electrical in nature such as pacemakers and other "active" implants, which can shield the substrates from interacting with body fluids in vivo. [0009] The present invention relates to coatings and methods for depositing a coating comprising a polymer and a impermeable dispersed solid onto a substrate. Provided herein are novel, easy to apply, polymer-based coatings and coating methods to seal and, thereby, shield, for example, medical devices that are electrical in nature such as pacemakers and other "active" implants from interacting with body fluids in vivo in a manner that disrupts the substrate's (e.g. active medical device's) intended functions and/or proper functioning, if any, or in a manner that has unintended consequences within and/or to the patient. Provided herein are novel, easy to apply, polymer-based coatings and coating methods to seal, for example, implantable medical devices that are electrical in nature such as pacemakers and other "active" implants and, thereby, shield the body from degradation products, leachants, and extractables from the medical device. The coatings and methods provided herein result in a collection process on the substrate that is efficient, a conformal, substantially defect-free, and uniform coating, and a regulatable and controllable coating composition. The coating structures and methods provided herein not only avoid the problems of polymer coatings (solvent-based, and solvent-less), but they also improve the barrier properties of polymer films for use as a seal upon, for example, biologically implanted devices.<br>
[0010] Provided herein is a method for electrostatic capture of polymer particles upon a substrate followed by sintering of these particles by exposure to compressed gasses. The coating methods used, including e-RESS, e-SEDS, and/or eDPC are free from elevated temperatures, solvent exposure, plasma environments, and other challenges associated with traditional polymer coating methods. [0011]  In some embodiments, a coating comprising electrostatically captured polymer particles (generated by eRESS, eSEDS or eDPC) with either concurrent or sequential captured impermeable particles (by eDPC, eRESS, eSEDS) on a medical implant substrate. A method is also provided for electrostatically capturing polymer particles (generated by eRESS, eSEDS or eDPC) with either concurrent or sequential capturing impermeable particles (by eDPC, eRESS, eSEDS) on a medical implant substrate. Following electrostatic capture of the impermeable particles and the polymer, the method comprises sintering the medical implant substrate with a compressed gas at conditions adequate to cause flow of the polymer particles into a continuous film on the substrate.<br>
 [0012] The polymers that could be used in the coatings or methods provided herein are all solution or thermally processible polymers (e.g. acrylates, olefins, fluoropolymers, urethanes, etc.). For example, a polymer (or polymers) could be used with known biocompatibility and high resistance to chemical degradation such as polymers of fluorinated olefins. The impermeable particles that could be used in this coating method includes all inorganic particles that can be obtained in the micron and/or sub-micron size range (for example, various compositions of clay, metal-oxides, ceramics, etc.) [0013]  In one embodiment, a polymer coating is sufficient to provide the requisite sealing properties. In another embodiment, the coating would contain a polymer continuous phase with particles embedded therein. The existence and distribution of the particles cases an increase in the barrier properties of the film to small molecules and gases by blocking diffusion pathways. [0014] In some embodiments, the surface of the particles is chemically modified to provide greater dispersion and incorporation into the polymer film. In some embodiments of the method for coating, the method comprises chemically modifying the surface of the particles to provide greater dispersion and incorporation into the polymer film. For example in the case of a highly polar particle (e.g. clay, Si02, Ti02, etc.) in a highly non-polar polymer (e.g. polymeric fluorinated olefins), the process comprises binding or bonding a non-polar chemistry to the surface of the particle prior to incorporation into the powder-coating and sintering process.<br>
[0015] Also, provided herein are stacked polymer films with an intervening impermeable layer which could provide similar protection for sensitive devices in vivo without the difficulty associated with welding metal cans around the device. In some embodiments, polymers to be used in the processes and in the coatings provided herein are inherently hydrophobic, thereby greatly reducing the likelihood of penetration of biological fluids. For example, fluoropolymers as a class yield high surface energy surfaces that meet this requirement. However, surfaces created from such polymers in some cases act as membranes through which water vapor transport can occur. Thus, in some embodiments, a second layer that can trap any water vapor that might permeate the fluoropolymer membrane is provided. In some embodiments, the method comprises depositing a hydrophilic polymer layer such as a silicon based polymer over the initial fluoropolymer layer. Silicon based polymers can be designed to possess differing degrees of hydrophilicity and therefore trap any water vapor that might permeate the fluoropolymer layer membrane. In some embodiments, the silicon-based polymer is reduced to native silicon and metallized with titanium. In some embodiments, a third layer of fluoropolymer is deposited to encapsulate the silicon based polymer layer between the fluropolymer layers. In some embodiments, the coating comprises multiple alternating layers of fluoropolymers and silicon based polymers. In some embodiments, the method comprises alternating multiple layers of the silicon based polymer and the fluropolymer.<br>
[0016] In some embodiments, the coating is designed to remain impermeable and/or impervious to gas and/or fluid for at least as long as the expected life span (e.g., period of time inside a subjects body) of the device and/or substrate it coats.<br>
[0017] One aspect of the invention provides methods for depositing a coating comprising a polymer and impermeable dispersed solid on a substrate, comprising discharging at least one impermeable dispersed solid in dry powder form through a first orifice; discharging at least one polymer in dry powder form through a second orifice; depositing the polymer and/or impermeable dispersed solids onto said substrate, wherein an electrical potential is maintained between the substrate and the impermeable dispersed solid and/or polymer particles, thereby forming said coating; and sintering said coating under conditions that do not substantially affect the substrate. In some embodiments, the impermeable dispersed solid is dispersed uniformly on all exposed surfaces of the substrate. In some embodiments, the impermeable dispersed solid is impermeable and/or impervious to gas. In some embodiments, the impermeable dispersed solid is impermeable and/or impervious to fluid. In some embodiments, the impermeable dispersed solid is impermeable and/or impervious to biological material.<br>
[0018]  In some embodiments, the impermeable dispersed solid comprises nanoparticles, such as, for example, a polyurethane adhesive nanocomposite (organically modified montmorillonite and polyurethane). In some embodiments, the oxygen transmission rate across the coating is at most about 1%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, or 70%. In some embodiments the water vapor permeation through the coating is at most about 1%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, or 70%. In referring to transmission rate or permeation, "about" refers to variations of .01% to .1%, or 1% to 5%.<br>
[0019]  Although the size, resistivity and moisture content of the polymer and impermeable dispersed solid may vary widely based on the conditions used, desired particle sizes are typically in the range of 0.01 um - 2500 um, and more preferably in the range of 0.01 urn - 100 um, resistivity is typically in the range of from about 106fim to about 1024Qm and moisture content is less than 5% by weight. In one embodiment of the invention the molecular weight range of the polymer is from about 5,000 a.u. to about 100,000 a.u.<br>
|0020]  In other embodiments, the first and second orifices are provided as one single orifice wherein the impermeable dispersed solid and polymer may be mixed together prior to discharging. In yet other embodiments the impermeable dispersed solid and polymer particles may be discharged simultaneously or in succession. In another embodiment of the invention the method further comprises discharging a third dry powder comprising a second impermeable dispersed solid whereby a coating comprising at least two different impermeable dispersed solids is deposited on said substrate. In certain other embodiments of the invention the impermeable dispersed solid is prepared by milling, jet-milling, granulation, spray drying, crystallizing or fluidizing.<br>
[0021]  In a further embodiment the impermeable dispersed solid and/or the polymer becomes electrostatically charged prior to deposition, and the substrate may be electrically grounded. In a preferred embodiment, the substrate is electrostatically charged. In some embodiments the polymer and impermeable dispersed solid are discharged using a gas based propellant, which typically<br>
comprises carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, chlorofluorocarbons, helium, nitrogen, compressed air, argon, or volatile hydrocarbons with a vapor pressure greater than 750 Torr at 20°C, and is preferably carbon dioxide.<br>
[0022] In one embodiment of the invention the impermeable dispersed solid comprises at least one drug. In another embodiment of the invention the ratio of impermeable dispersed solid to polymer is from about 1:1000 to about 3:10. In some embodiments, the amount of impermeable dispersed solid will depend on the particular dispersed solid being employed, the type of substrate, and the medical condition being treated.<br>
[0023]  Yet another aspect of the invention provides methods for depositing a coating comprising a polymer and a impermeable dispersed solid on a substrate, comprising discharging at least one impermeable dispersed solid in a therapeutically desirable morphology in dry powder form through a first orifice; forming a supercritical or near supercritical fluid mixture that includes at least one supercritical fluid solvent and at least one polymer and discharging said supercritical or near supercritical fluid solution through a second orifice under conditions sufficient to form solid particles of the polymer; depositing the polymer and/or impermeable dispersed solids onto said substrate, wherein an electrical potential is maintained between the substrate and the impermeable dispersed solids and/or polymer particles, thereby forming said coating and sintering said coating under conditions that do not substantially disrupt the substrate's (e.g. active medical device's) intended functions and proper functioning, if any, or that have unintended consequences within and/or to the patient once implanted.<br>
[0024]  Each of the above methods may be carried out from about 0°C to about 80°C and from about 0.1 atmospheres to about 73 atmospheres, in either open or closed vessel. In some embodiments, the substrate is a biomedical implant which may be a. a stent (e.g., vascular stents), electrode, catheter, lead, implantable pacemaker, implantable cardioverter, a housing for an implantable pacemaker, a housing for an implantable defibrillator, a housing for an implantable cardioverter, sensor, drug delivery device, therapy delivery device, device comprising telemetry capability, device comprising electrical impulses, diagnostic device, measurement device, joint, screw, rod, ophthalmic implant, femoral pin, bone plate, graft, anastomotic device, perivascular wrap, suture, staple, shuntsfor hydrocephalus, dialysis graft, colostomy bag attachment device, ear drainage tube, lead for pace makers and implantable cardioverters and defibrillators, vertebral disk, bone pin, suture anchor, hemostatic barrier, clamp, screws, plate, clip, vascular implant, tissue adhesive, sealant, tissue scaffolds, shunts, opthalmic implant, prosthetic, shunt, urologic implant, reproductive anatomy device, gastrologic device, neurologic lead, neurologic device, various types of dressings (e.g., wound dressings), bone substitutes, intraluminal devices, and vascular supports.<br>
[0025]  In some embodiments of the invention the thickness of said coating is from about 1 to about 100um, preferably about lOum, and the variation in the thickness along said coating is within 0.5um, within 0.25um, within O.lum or within 10% of the total thickness of said coating, within 5% of the<br>
total thickness of said coating, or within 2.5% of the total thickness of said coating. In yet other<br>
embodiments, the impermeable dispersed solid is positioned at a selected distance from top of said<br>
coating. In further embodiments, the impermeable dispersed solid is positioned at about midway<br>
between the top of said coating and the substrate surface. In other embodiments of the invention the<br>
variability in the amount of impermeable dispersed solid deposited on said substrate is 20% or less,<br>
15% or less, 10% or less, 5% or less, for a batch of substrates coated at the same time. Preferably the<br>
variability is 5% or less.<br>
[0026]  In yet other embodiments of the invention, the methods further comprise depositing a top layer<br>
on said coating wherein said top layer is a polymer film. In some embodiments, the polymer film has a<br>
thickness of 0.5 to 10 microns, and can be deposited by an eRESS or eSEDS, or a eDPC process. In<br>
yet other embodiments, the polymer film is formed by depositing a single polymer and for example by<br>
depositing substantially pure PBMA.<br>
[0027]  The invention further relates to the use of a supercritical solution comprising a second fluid in<br>
its supercritical state.<br>
[0028]  In some embodiments, the addition of a second fluid in its supercritical state is to act as a<br>
fiammability suppressor. In other embodiments, a second fluid is used, wherein said second fluid has<br>
critical parameters lower than the first fluid's critical parameters, and therefore lowers the critical<br>
properties of the mixture/solution enabling access to the mixture supercritical state.<br>
[0029] In some embodiments the supercritical solution comprises isobutylene. In other embodiments,<br>
the supercritical fluid comprises isobutylene and carbon dioxide as a second fluid.<br>
[0030]  Other embodiments of the invention provide a way to dissolve two polymers in a supercritical<br>
solvent. In some embodiments said two polymers are PEVA and PBMA. In other embodiments, a<br>
supercritical solution comprising two polymers is used to create a RESS spray of the polymers<br>
generating -10 to 100 nm particles of each polymer. In further embodiments, PEVA and PBMA are<br>
dissolved in a supercritical solvent that further comprises CO2 to act as a fire suppressor in the event of<br>
an ignition source causing a fire.<br>
A method of preparing a coated substrate comprising: providing a substrate; depositing on said<br>
substrate at least one layer comprising a polymer, wherein the layer substantially seals the substrate;<br>
wherein the layer is substantially impermeable to a gas; the layer is substantially impermeable to a<br>
fluid; and/or the layer is substantially impervious to a biological material.<br>

[0036] Applicants specifically intend that all United States patent references cited herein be incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.<br>
[0037] The present invention relates to coatings and methods for depositing a coating comprising a polymer and a impermeable dispersed solid onto a substrate. Provided herein are novel, easy to apply, polymer-based coatings and coating methods to seal and, thereby, shield, for example, implantable medical devices that are electrical in nature such as pacemakers and other "active" implants from interacting with body fluids in vivo in a manner that disrupts the medical device's intended functions and proper functioning, or in a manner that has unintended consequences within and/or to the patient. Provided herein are novel, easy to apply, polymer-based coatings and coating methods to seal, for example, implantable medical devices that are electrical in nature such as pacemakers and other "active" implants and, thereby, shield the body from degradation products, leachants, extractables from the medical device. The coatings and methods provided herein result in a collection process on the substrate that is an efficient, conformal, substantially defect-free, and uniform coating, and a regulatable and controllable coating composition. The coating structures and methods provided herein not only avoid the problems of polymer coatings (solvent-based, and solvent-less), but they also<br>
improve the barrier properties of polymer films for use as a seal upon, for example, biologically implanted devices.<br>
[0038]  Provided herein is a composite material coating containing polymer to provide increased barrier properties for gases such as water vapor, and method of creating such coating. [0039]  Provided herein is a composite material coating containing polymer plus a impermeable dispersed solid to provide increased barrier properties for gases such as water vapor, and method of creating such coating.<br>
[0040]  Provided herein is the a method for electrostatic capture of polymer particles upon a substrate followed by sintering of these particles by exposure to compressed gasses. The coating methods used, including e-RESS, e-SEDS, and/or eDPC are free from elevated temperatures, solvent exposure, plasma environments, and other challenges associated with traditional polymer coating methods. [0041]  In some embodiments, a coating comprising electrostatically captured polymer particles (generated by eRESS, eSEDS or eDPC) alone or optionally with either concurrent or sequential captured impermeable particles (by eDPC, eRESS, eSEDS) on a medical implant substrate. A method is also provided for electrostatically capturing polymer particles (generated by eRESS, eSEDS or eDPC) alone or with either concurrent or sequential capturing impermeable particles (by eDPC, eRESS, eSEDS) on a medical implant substrate. Following electrostatic capture of the polymer and optionally impermeable particles, the method comprises sintering the medical implant substrate with a compressed gas at conditions adequate to cause flow of the polymer particles into a continuous film on the substrate.<br>
[0042] The polymers that could be used in the coatings or methods provided herein are all solution or thermally processible polymers (e.g. acrylates, olefins, fluoropolymers, urethanes, etc.). For example, a polymer (or polymers) could be used with known biocompatibility and high resistance to chemical degradation such as polymers of fluorinated olefins. The impermeable particles that could be used in this coating method includes all inorganic particles that can be obtained in the micron and/or sub-micron size range. For example various compositions of clay, metal-oxides, ceramics, etc. [0043] The resulting film would contain a polymer continuous phase optionally with particles embedded therein. The existence and distribution of the particles causes an increase in the barrier properties of the film to small molecules and gases by blocking diffusion pathways. [0044] In some embodiments of the coating, the surface of the particles is chemically modified to provide greater dispersion and incorporation into the polymer film. In some embodiments of the method for coating, the method comprises chemically modifying the surface of the particles to provide greater dispersion and incorporation into the polymer film. For example in the case of a highly polar particle (e.g. clay, Si02, Ti02, etc.) in a highly non-polar polymer (e.g. polymeric fluorinated olefins), the process comprises binding or bonding a non-polar chemistry to the surface of the particle prior to incorporation into the powder-coating and sintering process.<br>
 [0045] Provided herein are stacked polymer films with an intervening impermeable layer which could provide similar protection for sensitive devices in vivo without the difficulty associated with welding metal cans around the device. In some embodiments, polymers to be used in the processes and in the coatings provided herein are inherently hydrophobic, thereby greatly reducing the likelihood of penetration of biological fluids. For example, fluoropolymers as a class yield high surface energy surfaces that meet this requirement. However, surfaces created from such polymers in some cases act as membranes through which water vapor transport can occur. Thus, in some embodiments, a second layer that can trap any water vapor that might permeate the fluoropolymer membrane is provided. In some embodiments, the method comprises depositing a hydrophilic polymer layer such as a silicon based polymer over the initial fluoropolymer layer. Silicon based polymers can be designed to possess differing degrees of hydrophilicity and therefore trap any water vapor that might permeate the fluoropolymer layer membrane. In some embodiments, the silicon-based polymer is reduced to native silicon and metallized with titanium.<br>
[0046]  In some embodiments, a highly absorbent material is used as the water-vapor trapping material. In some embodiments, the highly absorbent material comprises a hydrophilic polymer. In some embodiments, highly absorbent material comprises a superabsorbent polymer. [0047] In some embodiments, a third layer of fluoropolymer is deposited to encapsulate the silicon based polymer layer between the fluropolymer layers. In some embodiments, the coating comprises multiple alternating layers of fluoropolymers and silicon based polymers. In some embodiments, the method comprises alternating multiple layers of the silicon based polymer and the fluropolymer. [0048]  In some embodiments, the coating is designed to remain impermeable for at least as long as the expected life span of the device and/or substrate it coats.<br>
[0049]  One aspect of the invention provides methods for depositing a coating comprising a polymer and impermeable dispersed solid on a substrate, comprising discharging at least one impermeable dispersed solid in dry powder form through a first orifice; discharging at least one polymer in dry powder form through a second orifice; depositing the polymer and/or impermeable dispersed solids onto said substrate, wherein an electrical potential is maintained between the substrate and the impermeable dispersed solid and/or polymer particles, thereby forming said coating; and sintering said coating under conditions that do not substantially affect the substrate. In some embodiments, the impermeable dispersed solid is dispersed uniformly on all exposed surfaces of the substrate. [0050] In some embodiments, the impermeable dispersed solid comprises a nanoparticle, such as, for example, a polyurethane adhesive nanocomposite (organically modified montmorillonite and polyurethane). In some embodiments, the oxygen transmission rate across the coating is at most about 1%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, or 70%. In some embodiments the water vapor permeation through the coating is at most about 1%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, or 70%.

[0052] Although the size, resistivity and moisture content of the polymer and impermeable dispersed solid may vary widely based on the conditions used, desired particle sizes are typically in the range of 0.01 um - 2500 um, and more preferably in the range of 0.01 urn - 100 um, resistivity is typically in the range of from about 106Qm to about 1024Qm and moisture content is less than 5% by weight.

In a preferred embodiment, the substrate is electrostatically charged. In some embodiments the polymer and impermeable dispersed solid are discharged using a gas based propellant, which typically comprises carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, chlorofluorocarbons, helium, nitrogen, compressed air, argon, or volatile hydrocarbons with a vapor pressure greater than 750 Torr at 20°C, and is preferably carbon dioxide.<br>
[0055] In one embodiment of the invention the impermeable dispersed solid comprises at least one drug. In another embodiment of the invention the ratio of impermeable dispersed solid to polymer is from about 1:1000 to about 3:10. In some embodiments, the amount of impermeable dispersed solid<br>
will depend on the particular dispersed solid being employed, the type of substrate, and the medical condition being treated.<br>
[0056]  Yet another aspect of the invention provides methods for depositing a coating comprising a polymer and a impermeable dispersed solid on a substrate, comprising discharging at least one a impermeable dispersed solid in a therapeutically desirable morphology in dry powder form through a first orifice; forming a supercritical or near supercritical fluid mixture that includes at least one supercritical fluid solvent and at least one polymer and discharging said supercritical or near supercritical fluid solution through a second orifice under conditions sufficient to form solid particles of the polymer; depositing the polymer and/or impermeable dispersed solids onto said substrate, wherein an electrical potential is maintained between the substrate and the impermeable dispersed solids and/or polymer particles, thereby forming said coating and sintering said coating under conditions that do not substantially disrupt the substrate's (e.g. implantable active medical device's) intended functions and proper functioning, if any, or that have unintended consequences within and/or to the patient once implanted.<br>
[0057j  Each of the above methods may be carried out from about 0°C to about 80°C and from about 0.1 atmospheres to about 73 atmospheres, in either open or closed vessel. In some embodiments, the substrate is a stent (e.g., vascular stents), electrode, catheter, lead, implantable pacemaker, implantable cardioverter, a housing for an implantable pacemaker, a housing for an implantable defibrillator, a housing for an implantable cardioverter, sensor, drug delivery device, therapy delivery device, device comprising telemetry capability, device comprising electrical impulses, diagnostic device, measurement device, joint, screw, rod, ophthalmic implant, femoral pin, bone plate, graft, anastomotic device, perivascular wrap, suture, staple, shuntsfor hydrocephalus, dialysis graft, colostomy bag attachment device, ear drainage tube, lead for pace makers and implantable cardioverters and defibrillators, vertebral disk, bone pin, suture anchor, hemostatic barrier, clamp, screws, plate, clip, vascular implant, tissue adhesive, sealant, tissue scaffolds, shunts, opthalmic implant, prosthetic, shunt, urologic implant, reproductive anatomy device, gastrologic device, neurologic lead, neurologic device, various types of dressings (e.g., wound dressings), bone substitutes, intraluminal devices, and vascular supports..<br>

In yet other embodiments, the impermeable dispersed solid is positioned at a selected distance from top of said coating. In further embodiments, the impermeable dispersed solid is positioned at about midway between the top of said coating and the substrate surface. In other embodiments of the invention the variability in the amount of impermeable dispersed solid deposited on said substrate is 20% or less,<br>
15% or less, 10% or less, 5% or less, for a batch of substrates coated at the same time. Preferably the variability is 5% or less.<br>
[0059]  In yet other embodiments of the invention, the methods further comprise depositing a top layer on said coating wherein said top layer is a polymer film. In some embodiments, the polymer film has a thickness of 0.5 to 10 microns, and can be deposited by an eRESS or eSEDS, or a eDPC process. In yet other embodiments, the polymer film is formed by depositing a single polymer and can be formed by depositing substantially pure PBMA.<br>
[0060] The invention further relates to the use of a supercritical solution comprising a second fluid in its supercritical state.<br>
[0061] In some embodiments, the addition of a second fluid in its supercritical state is to act as a flammability suppressor. In other embodiments, a second fluid is used, wherein said second fluid has critical parameters lower than the first fluid's critical parameters, and therefore lowers the critical properties of the mixture/solution enabling access to the mixture supercritical state. [0062]  In some embodiments the supercritical solution comprises isobutylene. In other embodiments, the supercritical fluid comprises isobutylene and carbon dioxide as a second fluid. [0063]  Other embodiments of the invention provide a way to dissolve two polymers in a supercritical solvent. In some embodiments said two polymers are PEVA and PBMA. In other embodiments, a supercritical solution comprising two polymers is used to create a RESS spray of the polymers generating -10 to 100 nm particles of each polymer. In further embodiments, PEVA and PBMA are dissolved in a supercritical solvent that further comprises C02 to act as a fire suppressor in the event of an ignition source causing a fire.<br>
[0064]  One aspect of the invention entails the deposition of the a impermeable dispersed solid as dry powders, using electrostatic capture to attract the powder particles to the substrate. Dry powder spraying is well known in the art, and dry powder spraying coupled with electrostatic capture has been described, for example in US Patents 5,470,603 6,319,541 or 6,372,246. The deposition of the polymer can be performed in any number of standard procedures, as the morphology of the polymer, so long as it provides coatings possessing the desired properties (e.g. thickness, conformity, defect-free, uniformity), and are free from elevated temperatures, solvent exposure, plasma environments, and other challenges associated with traditional polymer coating methods. [0065] The second step of the coating process involves taking the substrates that have been coated with impermeable dispersed solids and polymers and subjecting them to a sintering process that takes place under conditions free from elevated temperatures, solvent exposure, plasma environments, and other challenges associated with traditional polymer coating methods. The sintering process as used in the current invention refers to the process by which the co-deposited impermeable dispersed solid -polymer matrix become fused and adherent to the substrate by treatment of the coated substrate with a compressed gas, compressed liquid, or supercritical fluid that is a non-solvent for the polymers and the impermeable dispersed solid(s), but a plasticizing agent for the polymer. The sintering process takes<br>
place under conditions (e.g. mild temperatures), and using benign fluids (e.g. supercritical carbon dioxide) which will not affect the active substrate or its subsequent function, if any. [0066] One aspect of the invention is the combination of two or more of the e-DPC, e-RESS and e-SEDS spraying techniques.<br>
[0067]  A specific aspect of the invention involves the dry powder spraying of impermeable dispersed solid, in a preferred particle size, into the same capture vessel as a polymer that is also dry powder sprayed, whereby the spraying of the impermeable dispersed solid and the polymer is sequential or simultaneous.<br>
[0068]  In some embodiments, the invention involves the e-DPC spraying of the impermeable dispersed solid, into the same capture vessel as a polymer that is sequentially or simultaneously sprayed by the eRESS spray process. In some embodiments, the invention involves the e-DPC spraying of the impermeable dispersed solid, into the same capture vessel as a polymer that is sequentially or simultaneously sprayed by the eSEDS spray process. In some embodiments, the invention involves the e-DPC spraying of the impermeable dispersed solid, into the same capture vessel as a polymer that is sequentially or simultaneously sprayed by the eDPC spray process. [0069] In some embodiments, the invention involves the e-RESS spraying of the impermeable dispersed solid, into the same capture vessel as a polymer that is sequentially or simultaneously sprayed by the eRESS spray process. In some embodiments, the invention involves the e-RESS spraying of the impermeable dispersed solid, into the same capture vessel as a polymer that is sequentially or simultaneously sprayed by the eSEDS spray process. In some embodiments, the invention involves the e-RESS spraying of the impermeable dispersed solid, into the same capture vessel as a polymer that is sequentially or simultaneously sprayed by the eDPC spray process. [0070] In some embodiments, the invention involves the e-SEDS spraying of the impermeable dispersed solid, into the same capture vessel as a polymer that is sequentially or simultaneously sprayed by the eRESS spray process. In some embodiments, the invention involves the e-SEDS spraying of the impermeable dispersed solid, into the same capture vessel as a polymer that is sequentially or simultaneously sprayed by the eSEDS spray process. In some embodiments, the invention involves the e-SEDS spraying of the impermeable dispersed solid, into the same capture vessel as a polymer that is sequentially or simultaneously sprayed by the eDPC spray process. [0071] Any combination of the above processes is contemplated by this aspect of the invention. [0072] In further aspects of the invention the substrates that have been coated with impermeable dispersed solid and polymers, as described in the above embodiments are then subjected to a sintering process. The sintering process takes place under conditions free from elevated temperatures, solvent exposure, plasma environments, and other challenges associated with traditional polymer coating methods, and refers to a process by which the co-deposited impermeable dispersed solid-polymer matrix, becomes fused and adherent to the substrate. This is achieved by treating the coated substrate with a compressed gas, compressed liquid or supercritical fluid that is a non-solvent for the polymers,<br>
the impermeable dispersed solids, but a plasticizing agent for the polymer. The sintering process takes place under conditions (e.g. mild temperatures), and using benign fluids (e.g. supercritical carbon dioxide) which will not affect the active substrate or its subsequent function, if any. Other sintering processes, which do not affect the active substrate or its subsequent function, if any may also be contemplated by the present invention.<br>
Definitions<br>
[0073]  As used in the present specification, the following words and phrases are generally intended to have the meanings as set forth below, except to the extent that the context in which they are used indicates otherwise.<br>
[0074] "Substrate" as used herein, refers to any surface upon which it is desirable to deposit a coating comprising a polymer or a mix of polymer with or without impermeable dispersed solid, or hydrophobic polymers and a water-vapor-trapping material, wherein the coating process does not substantially disrupt the substrate's (e.g. implantable active medical device's) intended functions and/or proper functioning, if any, or in a manner that has unintended consequences within and/or to the patient. Biomedical implants are of particular interest for the present invention; however the present invention is not intended to be restricted to this class of substrates. Those of skill in the art will appreciate alternate substrates that could benefit from the coating process described herein, such as temporary implantable devices, diagnostic tests or kits.<br>
[0075]  "Biomedical implant" as used herein refers to any implant for insertion into the body of a human or animal subject, including but not limited to a stent (e.g., vascular stents), electrode, catheter, lead, implantable pacemaker, implantable cardioverter, a housing for an implantable pacemaker, a housing for an implantable defibrillator, a housing for an implantable cardioverter, sensor, drug delivery device, therapy delivery device, device comprising telemetry capability, device comprising electrical impulses, diagnostic device, measurement device, joint, screw, rod, ophthalmic implant, femoral pin, bone plate, graft, anastomotic device, perivascular wrap, suture, staple, shuntsfor hydrocephalus, dialysis graft, colostomy bag attachment device, ear drainage tube, lead for pace makers and implantable cardioverters and defibrillators, vertebral disk, bone pin, suture anchor, hemostatic barrier, clamp, screws, plate, clip, vascular implant, tissue adhesive, sealant, tissue scaffolds, shunts, opthalmic implant, prosthetic, shunt, urologic implant, reproductive anatomy device, gastrologic device, neurologic lead, neurologic device, various types of dressings (e.g., wound dressings), bone substitutes, intraluminal devices, and vascular supports, etc. [0076] The implants may be formed from any suitable material, including but not limited to organic polymers (including stable or inert polymers and biodegradable polymers), metals, inorganic materials such as silicon, and composites thereof, including layered structures with a core of one material and one or more coatings of a different material.<br>
 [00771 Subjects into which biomedical implants of the invention may be applied or inserted include both human subjects (including male and female subjects and infant, juvenile, adolescent, adult and geriatric subjects) as well as animal subjects (including but not limited to dog, cat, horse, monkey, etc.) for veterinary purposes.<br>
[0078] In a preferred embodiment the biomedical implant is an implantable pacemaker, cardioverter or defibrillator, or another active device or any implantable (permanent or temporary) device requiring sealing to prevent gas or fluid permeation.<br>
[0079]  "Active" or "Active medical device" as used herein refers to medical devices that are electrical in nature, such as pacemakers and other medical devices for sensing, delivery of therapeutics and/or active control of various bodily functions.<br>
[0080] "Medical device" as used herein can refer to biological implants as defined herein active or inactive. A medical device may be permanently implantable, temporarily implantable, entirely implantable (such as, for example, an implantable defibrillator), partially implantable (such as, for example, a sensing drainage catheter) and/or can refer to devices used on or in a patient during a diagnostic or therapeutic procedure, including during an invasive surgery or during a minimally invasive surgery. A medical device includes any instrument, apparatus, appliance, material or other article, whether used alone or in combination, including any software necessary for its proper application intended by the manufacturer to be used for human beings for the purpose of: diagnosis, prevention, monitoring, treatment or alleviation of disease, alleviation of pain, diagnosis, monitoring, treatment, alleviation of or compensation for an injury or handicap, investigation, replacement or modification of the anatomy or of a physiological process, control of conception, and which does not achieve its principal intended action in or on the human body by pharmacological, immunological or metabolic means, but which may be assisted in its function by such means. For example, an insulin pump implanted in a diabetic person which dispenses insulin stored in the pump into the patient's blood based upon glucose levels sensed by the pump is a medical device (and is an active medical device and a biological implant).<br>
[0081] "Biological material" as used herein can refer a biological material in gas or fluid state including small solid particles.<br>
[0082] "Defect" as used herein can refer to, but is not limited to: surface topology variability, such as a clump, a web, or a pool; a through-layer deficiency, such as a bare spot, a fracture, a crack, a pin hole, a thin spot, a blemish; or a under-layer defect, such as a bubble between layers, a bubble beneath a layer, matter trapped beneath a layer or between layers of coating which is not a part of the substrate or of the layer(s), such as dust, liquid, gas, or particulate, An under-layer defect might affect the seal of a substrate device. For example, an under-layer water vapor bubble might act as a sink for diffusion of water vapor, making an active device more prone to interacting with the vapor and/or potentially with body fluids in vivo in a manner that disrupts the substrate's (e.g. active device's) intended functions and/or proper functioning, if any, or in a manner that has unintended consequences within<br>
and/or to the patient. Likewise, any other defect (through-layer, or surface topology variability) which allows gas or fluids to interact with the substrate can potentially result in disruption of the substrate's (e.g. active device's) intended functions and/or proper functioning, if any, or in a manner that has unintended consequences within and/or to the patient (such as, for a non-limiting example, freeing leachables, and/or creating or releasing degradation products or extractables from the device and into the body of the patient).<br>
[0083]  "Conformal coating", "conformally coated", or "conformably coated" as used herein can refer to a protective covering that conforms to the configuration of the objects coated. A covering that is conformal covers susbtantially all surfaces with a uniform layer. For example, a coating layering process may confomally coat a device with a 10 micron coating (of a layer or of layers) plus or minus 10%, which results in a 10 micron plus or minus 10% coating on every external surface of the device that is at least about 20 microns apart from another external surface of the device (external surfaces of the device that are closer may appear to have thicker coatings as the coatings on of the two nearby surfaces join).<br>
[0084]   "Seal" or "Substantially seal" as used herein can refer to coating that substantially shields a substrate from interacting with materials (fluids, gases, solids), in a manner that disrupts the substrate's intended functions and/or proper functioning, if any, or in a manner that has unintended consequences within and/or to the patient. As used herein, the term(s) can refer to coating that substantially shields transmission of degradation products, leachants, and extractables from the substrate past and/or through the coating. Seals on a substrate can be applied to electronic circuitry to act as protection for the circuitry against, for example, moisture, dust, chemicals, and/or temperature extremes. Similarly, seals can be applied to devices to act as protection against, for example, moisture, dust, chemicals, leachants, extractable components (extractables) and/or degradation products, from passing from the device through the coating layer(s). A seal, therefore can be a oneway and/or two-way barrier to moisture, dust, chemicals, leachants, degradation products, and/or other material (fluid or gas), including biologic material. The one-way barrier can be a barrier in either direction, a barrier to allowing material to contact the substrate, or a barrier to allowing material to pass from the substrate through the coating for example to the blood stream of a subject. For example, a medical device that is electrical in nature such as a pacemaker and/or another "active" implant body fluids in vivo can be substantially sealed by a coating and, thereby, substantially shielded from interacting with materials (fluids, gases, solids), in a manner that disrupts the substrate's intended functions and/or proper functioning, if any, or in a manner that has unintended consequences within and/or to the patient. Medical devices that are not electrical in nature (or not primarily electrical in nature) may also be sealed as provided herein. "Substantially" where used herein with respect to sealing or seals, can mean at least about one of 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, 99.5% 99.6%, 99.7%, 99.8%, 99.9%, 99.95%, 99.99%, and 99.995% sealed. "About" where used herein with respect to sealing or seals percentages, can mean variability of .1 to .5%, or 1-5%. "Substantially" where used<br>
herein with respect to sealing or seals, can also or alternatively mean a seal that passes a coating visual inspection, an adhesion test, a chemical resistance test, and/or a coating fatigue test, device fatigue in an in vitro test, device fatigue in a simulated in vivo environment test, a resistance test in a simulated in vivo environment Examples of such tests include, but are not limited to, ASTM D6677, ASTM D3359, ASTM D4541, ASTM D2197, ASTM D2370, ASTM D5179, ASTM D4145, ASTM 4146, ASTM F1854-01.<br>
[0085]  "Polymer" as used herein, refers to a series of repeating monomeric units that have been cross-linked or polymerized. Any suitable polymer can be used to carry out the present invention. It is possible that the polymers of the invention may also comprise two, three, four or more different polymers. In some embodiments, of the invention only one polymer is used. In some preferred embodiments a combination of two polymers are used. Combinations of polymers can be in varying ratios, to provide coatings with differing properties.

1.01, 1.02, 1.03, 1.05, 1.06, 1.07, 1.08,1.09,2.00,2.01,2.02,2.03,2.04,2.05,2.06,2.07,2.08,2.09, 2.10, 2.11, 2.12, 2.13, 2.14, 2.15, 2.16, 2.17, 2.18, 2.19, 2.20, 2.21, 2.22, 2.23, 2.24, 2.25, 2.26, 2.27, 2.28, 2.29, 2.30, 2.31, 2.32, 2.33, 2.34, 2.35, 2.36, 2.37, 2.38, 2.39, 2.40 grams per cubic centimeter (g/cc). In referring to bulk density, "about" refers to variations of .001 to .005, or of 0.005 to 0.01 grams per cubic centimeter (g/cc).<br>
[0088]  "Polyolefin" as used herein can refer to a polymer prepared by the addition polymerization of one or more unsaturated monomers which contain only carbon and hydrogen atoms. Examples of such polyolefins include polyethylene, polypropylene, poly(l-butene), poly(2-butene), poly(l-pentene), poly(2-pentene), poly(3-methyl-l-pentene), poly(4-methyl-l-pentene), and the like. In addition, such term is meant to include blends of two or more polyolefins and random and block copolymers prepared from two or more different unsaturated monomers.<br>
[0089]  "Compressed fluid" as used herein refers to a fluid of appreciable density (e.g., &gt;0.2 g/cc) that is a gas at standard temperature and pressure. " Supercritical fluid", "near-critical fluid", "near-supercritical fluid", "critical fluid", "densified fluid" or "densified gas" as used herein refers to a compressed fluid under conditions wherein the temperature is at least 80% of the critical temperature of the fluid and the pressure is at least 50% of the critical pressure of the fluid.

[0092] "Rapid Expansion of Supercritical Solutions" or "RESS" as used herein involves the dissolution of a polymer into a compressed fluid, typically supercritical C02, followed by rapid expansion into a chamber at atmospheric pressure. The rapid expansion of the supercritical fluid solution through a small opening, with its accompanying decrease in density, reduces the dissolution capacity of the fluid and results in the nucleation and growth of polymer particles. [0093]  "Solution Enhanced Dispersion of Supercritical Solutions" or "SEDS" as used herein involves a spray process for the generation of polymer particles, which are formed when a compressed fluid (e.g. supercritical fluid, preferably supercritical C02) is used as a diluent to a vehicle in which a<br>
polymer dissolved, (one that can dissolve both the polymer and the compressed gas). The mixing of the compressed fluid diluent with the polymer-containing solution may be achieved by encounter of a first stream containing the polymer solution and a second stream containing the diluent compressed fluid, for example, within one spray nozzle or by the use of multiple spray nozzles. The solvent in the polymer solution may be one compound or a mixture of two or more ingredients and may be or comprise an alcohol (including diols, triols, etc.), ether, amine, ketone, carbonate, or alkanes, or hydrocarbon (aliphatic or aromatic) or may be a mixture of compounds, such as mixtures of alkanes, or mixtures of one or more alkanes in combination with additional compounds such as one or more alcohols, (e.g., from 0 or 0.1 to 5% of a Q to C,5 alcohol, including diols, triols, etc.). See for example US Patent No. 6,669,785. The solvent may optionally contain a surfactant, as also described in (for example) US Patent No. 6,669,785.<br>
[0094] In one embodiment of the SEDS process, a first stream of fluid comprising a polymer dissolved in a common solvent is co-sprayed with a second stream of compressed fluid. Polymer particles are produced as the second stream acts as a diluent that weakens the solvent in the polymer solution of the first stream. The now combined streams of fluid, along with the polymer particles, flow out of the nozzle assembly into a collection vessel. Control of particle size, particle size distribution, and morphology is achieved by tailoring the following process variables: temperature, pressure, solvent composition of the first stream, flow-rate of the first stream, flow-rate of the second stream, composition of the second stream (where soluble additives may be added to the compressed gas), and conditions of the capture vessel. Typically the capture vessel contains a fluid phase that is at least five to ten times (5-1 Ox) atmospheric pressure.<br>
[0095] "Electrostatically charged" or "electrical potential" or "electrostatic capture" as used herein refers to the collection of the spray-produced particles upon a substrate that has a different electrostatic potential than the sprayed particles. Thus, the substrate is at an attractive electronic potential with respect to the particles exiting, which results in the capture of the particles upon the substrate, i.e. the substrate and particles are oppositely charged, and the particles transport through the fluid medium of the capture vessel onto the surface of the substrate is enhanced via electrostatic attraction. This may be achieved by charging the particles and grounding the substrate or conversely charging the substrate and grounding the particles, or by some other process, which would be easily envisaged by one of skill in the art of electrostatic capture.<br>
[0096] "Electrostatic Rapid Expansion of Supercritical Solutions" or "e-RESS" or "eRESS" as used herein refers to Electrostatic Capture as described herein combined with Rapid Expansion of Supercritical Solutions as described herein.<br>
[0097] "Electrostatic Solution Enhanced Dispersion of Supercritical Solutions" or "e-SEDS" or "eSEDS" as used herein, refers to Electrostatic Capture as described herein combined with Solution Enhanced Dispersion of Supercritical Solutions as described herein.<br>
 [00981 "Electrostatic Dry Powder Coating" or "e-DPC" or "eDPC" as used herein refers to Electrostatic Capture as described herein combined with Dry Powder Coating. e-DPC deposits material (including, for example, polymer or impermeable dispersed solid) on the device or other substrate as dry powder, using electrostatic capture to attract the powder particles to the substrate. Dry powder spraying ("Dry Powder Coating" or "DPC" ) is well known in the art, and dry powder spraying coupled with electrostatic capture has been described, for example in US Patents: 5,470,603; 6,319,541; or 6,372,246.<br>
[0099]  "Open vessel" as used herein refers to a vessel open to the outside atmosphere, and thus at substantially the same temperature and pressure as the outside atmosphere.<br>
[00100] "Closed vessel" as used herein refers to a vessel sealed from the outside atmosphere, and thus may be at significantly different temperatures and pressures to the outside atmosphere. Examples<br>
[00101] The following examples are given to enable those skilled in the art to more clearly understand and to practice the present invention. They should not be considered as limiting the scope of the invention, but merely as being illustrative and representative thereof. [00102] Example 1:<br>
[00103] A biocompatible fluoropolymer or other hydrophobic biocompatible polymer is dissolved in an appropriate supercritical solvent such as carbon dioxide. This solution is maintained in a syringe pump or other pressure vessel and transferred to a spraying vessel that is maintained above the compressed gas's critical pressure and temperature as modified by the solute. The device or other substrate to be coated is held such that it can placed at an electrical potential relative to a nozzle through which the compressed gas solution is to be sprayed (10 kV, for example, with the device held at 5 kV and the nozzle held at -5kV). The electrical field between the device and the nozzle is designed to be homogenous and constant. The polymer solution is expanded through the restrictor nozzle by electrostatic rapid expansion of a supercritical solution (e-RESS), thereby coating the device with a fine film controllable in both thickness and conformality. Subsequent processing in the gas in its uncompressed state further reduces the volume of the film increasing its conformality. A second layer is deposited consisting of a silicon based polymer in the same manner as the first polymer layer. Alternatively, this polymer could be deposited as a dry dispersed solid using e-DPC or from solution in a compressed gas solvent. This silicon based polymer is selected so that it traps any water vapor that permeates the fluoropolymer layer. Finally, the polymer stack is completed by deposition of another layer of fluoropolymer using the e-RESS process and processed to reduce its volume (processing in the gas in its uncompressed state to further reduce the volume of the film and increase its conformality). [00104) Example 2<br>
[00105] A biocompatible fluoropolymer or other hydrophobic biocompatible polymer is dissolved in an appropriate supercritical solvent such as carbon dioxide. This solution is maintained in a syringe<br>
pump or other pressure vessel and transferred to a spraying vessel that is maintained above the compressed gas's critical pressure and temperature as modified by the solute. The device or other substrate to be coated is held such that it can placed at an electrical potential relative to a nozzle through which the compressed gas solution is to be sprayed (10 kV, for example, with the device held at 5 kV and the nozzle held at -5kV). The electrical field between the device and the nozzle is designed to be homogenous and constant. The polymer solution is expanded through the restrictor nozzle by electrostatic rapid expansion of a supercritical solution (e-RESS), thereby coating the device with a fine film controllable in both thickness and conformality. Subsequent processing in the gas in its uncompressed state further reduces the volume of the film increasing its conformality. A second layer of carbonaceous material is deposited by e-DPC. A quantity of carbonaceous material is loaded as a plug into a chamber. The quantity of material initially loaded is dependent upon the desired coating mass and is a function of the potential at which the device or other substrate is held and the backpressure placed on the plug. A valve is rapidly opened through which the material expands creating an aerosolized cloud which coats the device or other substrate as a dry powder. This coating is immediately followed with a second fluoropolymer coating and undergoes the same volume reducing process as the initial layer (processing in the gas in its uncompressed state to further reduce the volume of the film and increase its conformality).<br>
