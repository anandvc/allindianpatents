				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The following description of the background of the<br>
invention is provided to aid in understanding the invention<br>
but is not admitted to be prior art to the invention.<br>
Cellular signal transduction is a fundamental<br>
mechanism whereby external stimuli regulating diverse<br>
cellular processes are relayed to the interior of cells.<br>
One of the key biochemical mechanisms of signal<br>
transduction involves the reversible phosp.horylation of<br>
proteins, which enables regulation of the activity of<br>
mature proteins by altering their structure, and function.<br>
The best characterized protein kinases in eukaryotes<br>
phosphorylate proteins on the alcohol moiety of serine,<br>
threonine, and tyrosine residues. These kinases largely<br>
fall into two groups, those specific for phosphorylating<br>
serine and threonine, and those specific for<br>
phosphorylating tyrosine. Some kinases, referred to as<br>
"dual specificity" kinases, are able to phosphorylate on<br>
tyrosine as well as serine/threonine residues.<br>
Protein kinases can also be characterized by their<br>
location within the cell. Some kinases are transmembrane<br>
receptor proteins capable of binding ligands external to<br>
the cell membrane. Binding the ligands alters the receptor<br>
protein kinase's catalytic activity. Others are non-<br>
receptor proteins lacking a transmembrane domain. Non-<br>
receptor protein kinases can be found in a variety of<br>
cellular compartments from the inner-surface of the cell<br>
membrane to the nucleus.<br>
Many kinases are involved in regulatory cascades where<br>
their substrates may include other kinases whose activities<br>
are regulated by their phosphorylation state. Ultimately<br>
the activity of a downstream effector is modulated by<br>
phosphorylation resulting from activation of such a<br>
pathway.<br>
The serine/threonine kinase family includes members<br>
that regulate many steps of signaling cascades, including<br>
cascades controlling cell growth, migration,<br>
differentiation, gene expression, muscle contraction,<br>
glucose metabolism, cellular protein synthesis, and<br>
regulation of the cell cycle.<br>
An example of a non-receptor protein kinase that<br>
phosphorylates protein targets on serine and threonine<br>
residues is RAF. RAF modulates the catalytic activity of<br>
other protein kinases, such as the protein kinase that<br>
phosphorylates and thereby activates mitogen activated<br>
protein kinase (MAPK). RAF itself is activated by the<br>
membrane anchored protein RAS, which in turn is activated<br>
in response to ligand activated tyrosine receptor protein<br>
kinases such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and<br>
platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR). The<br>
biological importance of RAF in controlling cellular events<br>
is underscored by the finding that altered forms of RAF can<br>
cause cancer in organisms. Evidence for importance of RAF<br>
in malignancies is provided in Monia et al., 1996, Nature<br>
Medicine 2: 668, incorporated herein by reference in its<br>
entirety including all figures and tables.<br>
In an effort to discover novel treatments for cancer<br>
and other diseases, biomedical researchers and chemists<br>
have designed, synthesized, and tested molecules that<br>
inhibit the function of protein kinases. Some small<br>
organic molecules form a class of compounds that modulate<br>
the function of protein kinases. Examples of molecules<br>
that have been reported to inhibit the function of protein<br>
kinases are bis monocyclic, bicyclic or heterocyclic aryl<br>
compounds (PCT WO 92/20642), vinylene-azaindole derivatives<br>
(PCT WO 94/14808), 1-cyclopropyl-4-pyridyl-quinolones (U.S.<br>
Patent No. 5,330,992), styryl compounds (U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,217,999), styryl-substituted pyridyl compounds (U.S.<br>
Patent No. 5,302,606), certain quinazoline derivatives (EP<br>
Application No. 0 566 266 A1) , seleoindoles and selenides<br>
(PCT WO 94/03427), tricyclic polyhydroxylic compounds (PCT<br>
WO 92/21660), and benzylphosphonic acid compounds (PCT WO<br>
91/15495).<br>
The compounds that can traverse cell membranes and are<br>
resistant to acid hydrolysis are potentially advantageous<br>
therapeutics as they can become highly bioavailable after<br>
being administered orally to patients. However, many of<br>
these protein kinase inhibitors only weakly inhibit the<br>
function of protein kinases. In addition, many inhibit a<br>
variety of protein kinases and will therefore cause<br>
multiple side-effects as therapeutics for diseases.<br>

I. Methods for Screening Compounds that Modulate<br>
Serine/Threonine Protein Kinase Function<br>
The methods of the present invention provide means for<br>
modulating the function of both receptor and cytosolic<br>
serine/threonine protein kinases. These methods provide<br>
umeans of modulating the enzymes both in vitro and in vivo.<br>
For in vitro applications, the methods of the invention<br>
relate in part to method of identifying compounds that<br>
modulate the function of serine/threonine protein kinases.<br>
Thus, in a first aspect, the invention features a<br>
method of modulating the function of a serine/threonine<br>
protein kinase with an azabenzimidazole-based compound.<br>
The azabenzimidazole compound is optionally substituted<br>
with organic groups. The method comprises comprises<br>
contacting cells expressing the serine/threonine protein<br>
kinase with the compound.<br>
The term "function" refers to the cellular role of a<br>
serine/threonine protein kinase. The serine/threonine<br>
protein kinase family includes members that regulate many<br>
steps in signaling cascades, including cascades controlling<br>
cell growth, migration, differentiation, gene expression,<br>
muscle contraction, glucose metabolism, cellular protein<br>
synthesis, and regulation of the cell cycle.<br>
The term "modulates" refers to the ability of, a<br>
compound to alter the function of a protein kinase. A<br>
modulator preferably activates the catalytic activity of a<br>
protein kinase, more preferably activates or inhibits the<br>
catalytic activity of a protein kinase depending on the<br>
concentration of the compound exposed to the protein<br>
kinase, or most preferably inhibits the catalytic activity<br>
of a protein kinase.<br><br>
The term "catalytic activity", in the context of the<br>
invention, defines the rate at which a protein kinase<br>
phosphorylates a substrate. Catalytic activity can be<br>
measured, for example, by determining the amount of a<br>
substrate converted to a product as a function of time.<br>
Phosphorylation of a substrate occurs at the active-site of<br>
a protein kinase. The active-site is normally a cavity in<br>
which the substrate binds to the protein kinase and is<br>
phosphorylated.<br>
The term "substrate" as used herein refers to a<br>
molecule phosphorylated by a serine/threonine protein<br>
kinase. The substrate is preferably a peptide and more<br>
preferably a protein. In relation to the protein kinase<br>
RAF, preferred substrates are MEK and the MEK substrate<br>
MAPK.<br>
The term "activates" refers to increasing the cellular<br>
function of a protein kinase. The protein kinase function<br>
is preferably the interaction with a natural binding<br>
partner and most preferably catalytic activity.<br>
The term "inhibit" refers to decreasing the cellular<br>
function of a protein kinase. The protein kinase function<br>
is preferably the interaction with a natural binding<br>
partner and most preferably catalytic activity.<br>
The term "modulates" also refers to altering the<br>
function of a protein kinase by increasing or decreasing<br>
the probability that a complex forms between a protein<br>
kinase and a natural binding partner. A modulator<br>
preferably increases the probability that such a complex<br>
forms between the protein kinase and the natural binding<br>
partner, more preferably increases or decreases the<br>
probability that a complex forms between the protein kinase<br>
and the natural binding partner depending on the<br>
concentration of the compound exposed to the protein<br>
kinase, and most preferably decreases the probability that<br>
a complex forms between the protein kinase and the natural<br>
binding partner.<br>
The term "complex" refers to an assembly of at least<br>
two molecules bound to one another. Signal transduction<br>
complexes often contain at least two protein molecules<br>
bound to one another. For instance, a protein tyrosine<br>
receptor protein kinase, GRB2, SOS, RAF, and RAS assemble<br>
to form a signal transduction complex in response to a<br>
mitogenic ligand.<br>
The term "natural binding partner" refers to<br>
polypeptides that bind to a protein kinase in cells.<br>
Natural binding partners can play a role in propagating a<br>
signal in a protein kinase signal transduction process. A<br>
change in the interaction between a protein kinase and a<br>
natural binding partner can manifest itself as an increased<br>
or decreased probability that the interaction forms, or an<br>
increased or decreased concentration of the protein<br>
kinase/natural binding partner complex.<br>
A protein kinase natural binding partner can bind to a<br>
protein kinase's intracellular region with high affinity.<br>
High affinity represents an equilibrium binding constant on<br>
the order of 10"6 M or less. In addition, a natural<br>
binding partner can also transiently interact with a<br>
protein kinase intracellular region and chemically modify<br>
it. Protein kinase natural binding partners are chosen<br>
from a group that includes, but is not limited to, SRC<br>
homology 2 (SH2) or 3 (SH3) domains, other phosphoryl<br>
tyrosine binding (PTB) domains, guanine nucleotide exchange<br>
factors, protein phosphatases, and other protein kinases.<br>
Methods of determining changes in interactions between<br>
protein kinases and their natural binding partners are<br>
readily available in the art.<br>
The term "serine/threonine protein kinase" refers to<br>
an enzyme with an amino acid sequence with at least 10%<br>
amino acid identity to other enzymes that phosphorylate<br>
proteins on serine and threonine residues. A<br>
serine/threonine protein kinase catalyzes the addition of<br>
phosphate onto proteins on serine and threonine residues.<br>
Serine/threonine protein kinases can exist as membrane<br>
bound proteins or cytosolic protins.<br>
The term "contacting" as used herein refers to mixing<br>
a solution comprising an azabenzimidazole compound of the<br>
invention with a liquid medium bathing the cells of the<br>
methods. The solution comprising the compound may also<br>
comprise another component, such as dimethylsulfoxide<br>
(DMSO), which facilitates the uptake of the<br>
azabenzimidazole compound or compounds into the cells of<br>
the methods. The solution comprising the azabenzimidazole<br>
compound may be added to the medium bathing the cells by<br>
utilizing a delivery apparatus, such as a pipet-based<br>
device or syringe-based device.<br>
The term "azabenzimidazole-based compound" refers to<br>
an azabenzimidazole organic compound substituted with<br>
chemical substituents. Azabenzimidazole compounds are of<br>
the general structure:<br>
The term "substituted", in reference to the invention,<br>
refers to an azabenzimidazole compound that is derivatized<br>
with any number of chemical substituents.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the invention relates to<br>
the method of modulating the function of a serine/threonine<br>
protein kinase, where the protein kinase is RAF.<br>
The RAF protein kinase phosphorylates protein targets<br>
on serine or threonine residues. One such protein target<br>
is the protein kinase (MEK) that phosphorylates and<br>
consequently activates mitogen activated protein kinase<br>
(MAPK). RAF itself is activated by the membrane-bound<br>
guanine triphosphate hydrolyzing enzyme RAS in response to<br>
mitogen-stimulated receptor protein tyrosine kinases, such<br>
as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and platelet-<br>
derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR).<br>
The methods of the present invention can detect<br>
compounds that modulate the function of the RAF protein<br>
kinase in cells. RAF phosphorylates a protein kinase (MEK)<br>
which in turn phosphorylates mitogen-activated protein<br>
kinase (MAPK). Assays that monitor only the<br>
phosphorylation of MEK by RAF are not sensitive because the<br>
phosphorylation levels of MEK are not significant. To<br>
overcome this sensitivity dilemma, the phosphorylation of<br>
both MEK and MAPK are followed in the assays of the present<br>
invention. The MAPK phosphorylation signal amplifies the<br>
MEK phosphorylation signal and allows RAF-dependent<br>
phosphorylation to be followed in assays, such as enzyme-<br>
linked immunosorbant assays. In addition, the assay of the<br>
invention is performed in a high throughput format such<br>
that many compounds can be rapidly monitored in a short<br>
period of time.<br>
In another aspect, the invention describes a method of<br>
identifying compounds that modulate the function of<br>
serine/threonine protein kinase, comprising the steps of<br>
contacting cells expressing the serine/threonine protein<br>
kinase with the compound, and monitoring an effect upon the<br>
cells.<br>
The term "monitoring" refers to observing the effect<br>
of adding the compound to the cells of the method. The<br>
effect can be manifested in a change in cell phenotype,<br>
cell proliferation, protein kinase catalytic activity, or<br>
in the interaction between a protein kinase and a natural<br>
binding partner.<br>
The term "effect" describes a change or an absence of<br>
a change in cell phenotype or cell proliferation. "Effect"<br>
can also describe a change or an absence of a change in the<br>
catalytic activity of the protein kinase. "Effect" can<br>
also describe a change or an absence of a change in an<br>
interaction between the protein kinase and a natural<br>
binding partner.<br>
A preferred embodiment of the invention relates to the<br>
method of identifying compounds that modulate the function<br>
of serine/threonine protein kinase, where the effect is a<br>
change or an absence of a change in cell phenotype.<br>
The term "cell phenotype" refers to the outward<br>
appearance of a cell or tissue or the function of the cell<br>
or tissue. Examples of cell phenotype are cell size<br>
(reduction or enlargement), cell proliferation (increased<br>
or decreased numbers of cells), cell differentiation (a<br>
change or absence of a change in cell shape), cell<br>
survival, apoptosis (cell death), or the utilization of a<br>
metabolic nutrient (e.g., glucose uptake). Changes or the<br>
absence of changes in cell phenotype are readily measured<br>
by techniques known in the art.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the invention relates<br>
to the method of identifying compounds that modulate the<br>
function of serine/threonine protein kinase, where the<br>
effect is a change or an absence of a change in cell<br>
proliferation.<br>
The term "cell proliferation" refers to the rate at<br>
which a group of cells divides. The number of cells<br>
growing in a vessel can be quantified by a person skilled<br>
in the art when that person visually counts the number of<br>
cells in a defined volume using a common light microscope.<br>
Alternatively, cell proliferation rates can be quantified<br>
by laboratory apparatae that optically or conductively<br>
measure the density of cells in an appropriate medium.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the invention relates<br>
to the method of identifying compounds that modulate the<br>
function of serine/threonine protein kinase, where the<br>
effect is a change or an absence of a change in the<br>
interaction between the serine/threonine protein kinase<br>
with a natural binding partner.<br>
The term "interaction", in the context of the<br>
invention, describes a complex formed between a protein<br>
kinase's intracellular region and a natural binding partner<br>
or compound. The term "interaction" can also extend to a<br>
complex formed between a compound of the invention with<br>
intracellular regions and extracellular regions of the<br>
protein kinase under study. Although a cytosolic protein<br>
kinase will have no extracellular region, a receptor<br>
protein kinase will harbor both an extracellular and an<br>
intracellular region.<br>
The term "intracellular region" as used herein refers<br>
to the portion of a protein kinase which exists inside a<br>
cell. The term "extracellular region" as used herein<br>
refers to a portion of a protein kinase which exists<br>
outside of the cell.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the invention relates to<br>
the method of identifying compounds that modulate the<br>
function of serine/threonine protein kinase that further<br>
comprises the following steps:(a) lysing the cells to<br>
render a lysate comprising serine/threonine protein kinase;<br>
(b) adsorbing the serine/threonine protein kinase to an<br>
antibody; (c) incubating the adsorbed serine/threonine<br>
protein kinase with a substrate or substrates; and (d)<br>
adsorbing the substrate or substrates to a solid support or<br>
antibody. The step of monitoring the effect on 'the cells<br>
comprises measuring the phosphate concentration of the<br>
substrate or substrates.<br>
The term "lysing" as used herein refers to a method of<br>
disrupting the integrity of a cell such that its interior<br>
contents are liberated. Cell lysis is accomplished by many<br>
techniques known to persons skilled in the art. The method<br>
is accomplished preferably by sonication or cell sheering<br>
techniques and more preferably by detergent techniques.<br>
The term "antibody" as used herein refers to a protein<br>
molecule that specifically binds a protein kinase. An<br>
antibody preferably binds to one class of protein kinase<br>
and more preferably specifically binds to the RAF protein<br>
kinase.<br>
The term "specifically binds" as used herein refers to<br>
an antibody that binds a protein kinase with higher<br>
affinity than another protein kinase or cellular protein.<br>
An antibody that specifically binds to a protein kinase<br>
will bind a higher concentration of the specific protein<br>
kinase than any other protein kinase or cellular protein.<br>
The term "adsorbing" as used herein refers to the<br>
binding of a molecule to the surface of an antibody or<br>
solid support. Examples of solid supports are chemically<br>
modified cellulose, such as phosphocellulose, and nylon.<br>
Antibodies can be linked to solid supports using techniques<br>
well known to individuals of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
See, e.g., Harlo &amp; Lane, Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual,<br>
1989, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories.<br>
The term "measuring the phosphate concentration" as<br>
used herein refers to techniques commonly known to persons<br>
of ordinary skill in the art. These techniques can involve<br>
quantifying the concentration of phosphate concentrations<br>
within a substrate or determining relative amounts of<br>
phosphate within a substrate. These techniques can include<br>
adsorbing the substrate to a membrane and detecting the<br>
amount of phosphate within the substrate by radioactive<br>
measurements.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the invention relates<br>
to the method of identifying compounds that modulate the<br>
function of serine/threonine protein kinase that further<br>
comprises the following steps: (a) lysing the cells to<br>
render a lysate comprising RAF; (b) adsorbing the RAF to an<br>
antibody; (c) incubating the adsorbed RAF with MEK and<br>
MAPK; and (d) adsorbing the MEK and MAPK to a solid support<br>
or antibody or antibodies. The step of measuring the<br>
effect on the cells comprises monitoring the phosphate<br>
concentration of said MEK and MAPK.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the invention relates to<br>
the method of identifying compounds that modulate the<br>
function of serine/threonine protein kinase, where the<br>
azabenzimidazole-based compound has a structure set forth<br>
in formula I, II, or III as defined herein or any of the<br>
subgroups thereof set forth herein.<br>
The term "compound" refers to the compound or a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester, amide, prodrug,<br>
isomer, or metabolite, thereof.<br>
The term "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" refers to<br>
a formulation of a compound that does not abrogate the<br>
biological activity and properties of the compound.<br>
Pharmaceutical salts can be obtained by reacting a compound<br>
of the invention with inorganic or organic acids such as<br>
hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric<br>
acid, phosphoric acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic<br>
acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, salicylic acid and the like.<br>
The term "prodrug" refers to an agent that is<br>
converted into the parent drug in vivo. Prodrugs may be<br>
easier to administer than the parent drug in some<br>
situations. For example, the prodrug may be bioavailable<br>
by oral administration but the parent is not, or the<br>
prodrug may improve solubility to allow for intravenous<br>
administration.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the invention relates<br>
to the method of identifying compounds that modulate the<br>
function of serine/threonine protein kinase, where the<br>
azabenzimidazole-based compound has a structure set forth<br>
in formula I, II, or III, where the azabenzimidazole<br>
compound is selected from the group consisting of SABI<br>
compounds.<br>
The term "SABI compounds" refers to the group of<br>
azabenzimidazole-based compounds having a structure set<br>
forth in formula A or B, and numbered A-l through A-198 in<br>
the following table:<br>
In another aspect, the invention features a method of<br>
preventing or treating an abnormal condition in an organism<br>
by administering a compound of the invention, as specified<br>
herein by formula I, II, or III, with any of the<br>
constraints provided herein, to an organism.<br>
The term "organism" relates to any living entity<br>
comprising at least one cell. An organism can be as simple<br>
as one eukaryotic cell or as complex as a mammal. In<br>
preferred embodiments, an organism refers to humans or<br>
mamals.<br>
The term "preventing" refers to the method of the<br>
invention decreasing the probability, or eliminating the<br>
possibility, that an organism contracts or develops the<br>
abnormal condition.<br>
The term "treating" refers to the method of the<br>
invention having a therapeutic effect and at least<br>
partially alleviating or abrogating the abnormal condition<br>
in the organism.<br>
The term "therapeutic effect" refers to the inhibition<br>
of cell growth causing or contributing to an abnormal<br>
condition. The term "therapeutic effect" also refers to<br>
the inhibition of growth factors causing or contributing to<br>
the abnormal condition (e.g. cancer). A therapeutic effect<br>
relieves to some extent one or more of the symptoms of the<br>
abnormal condition. In reference to the treatment of a<br>
cancer, a therapeutic effect refers to one or more of the<br>
following: (a) a reduction in tumor size; (b) inhibition<br>
(i.e., slowing or stopping) tumor metastasis; (c)<br>
inhibition of tumor growth; and (d) relieving to some<br>
extent one or more of the symptoms associated with the<br>
abnormal condition. Compounds demonstrating efficacy<br>
against leukemias can be identified as described herein,<br>
except that rather than inhibiting metastasis, the<br>
compounds may instead slow or decrease cell proliferation<br>
or cell growth.<br>
The term "abnormal condition" refers to a function in<br>
the cells or tissues of an organism that deviates from<br>
their normal functions in that organism. An abnormal<br>
condition can relate to cell proliferation, cell<br>
differentiation, or cell survival.<br>
Aberrant cell proliferative conditions include cancers<br>
such as fibrotic and mesangial disorders, abnormal<br>
angiogenesis and vasculogenesis, wound healing, psoriasis,<br>
diabetes mellitus, and inflammation.<br>
Aberrant differentiation conditions include, but are<br>
not limited to neurodegenerative disorders, slow wound<br>
healing rates, and tissue grafting techniques.<br>
Aberrant cell survival conditions relate to conditions<br>
in which programmed cell death (apoptosis) pathways are<br>
activated or abrogated. A number of protein kinases are<br>
associated with the apoptosis pathways. Aberrations in the<br>
function of any one of the protein kinases could lead to<br>
cell immortality or premature cell death.<br>
Cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival are<br>
phenomena simply measured by methods in the art. These<br>
methods can involve observing the number of cells or the<br>
appearance of cells under a microscope with respect to time<br>
(for example, days).<br>
The term "administering" relates broadly to the<br>
provision to an organism and more specifically to a method<br>
of incorporating a compound into cells or tissues of an<br>
organism. The abnormal condition can be prevented or<br>
treated when the cells or tissues of the organism exist<br>
within the organism or outside of the organism. Cells<br>
existing outside the organism can be maintained or grown in<br>
cell culture dishes. For cells harbored within the<br>
organism, many techniques exist in the art to administer<br>
compounds, including (but not limited to) oral, parenteral,<br>
dermal, injection, and aerosol applications. For cells<br>
outside of the organism, multiple techniques exist in the<br>
art to administer the compounds, including (but not limited<br>
to) cell microinjection techniques, transformation<br>
techniques, and carrier techniques.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the invention relates to a<br>
method of preventing or treating an abnormal condition in<br>
an organism, where the azabenzimidazole-based compound has<br>
a structure set forth in formula I, II, or III as defined<br>
herein or any of the subgroups thereof set forth herein.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the invention relates<br>
to a method of preventing or treating an abnormal condition<br>
in an organism, where the azabenzimidazole compound is<br>
selected from the group consisting of SABI compounds.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the invention relates<br>
to a method of preventing or treating an abnormal condition<br>
in an organism, where the organism is a mammal.<br>
The term "mammal" refers preferably to such organisms<br>
as mice, rats, rabbits, guinea pigs, and goats, more<br>
preferably to monkeys and apes, and most preferably to<br>
humans.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the invention relates<br>
to a method of preventing or treating an abnormal condition<br>
in an organism, where the abnormal condition is cancer or a<br>
fibrotic disorder.<br>
In yet another preferred embodiment, the invention<br>
relates to a method of preventing or treating an abnormal<br>
condition in an organism, where the cancer is selected from<br>
the group consisting of lung cancer, ovarian cancer, breast<br>
cancer, brain cancer, intra-axial brain cancer, colon<br>
cancer, prostate cancer, sarcoma, Kaposi's sarcoma,<br>
melanoma, and glioma.<br>
In still another preferred embodiment, the invention<br>
relates to a method of preventing or treating an abnormal<br>
condition in an organism, where the method applies to an<br>
abnormal condition associated with an aberration in a<br>
signal transduction pathway characterized by an interaction<br>
between a serine/threonine protein kinase and a natural<br>
binding partner.<br>
The term "signal transduction pathway" refers to the<br>
propagation of a signal. In general, an extracellular<br>
signal is transmitted through the cell membrane to become<br>
an intracellular signal. This signal can then stimulate a<br>
cellular response. The term also encompases signals that<br>
are propagated entirely within a cell. The polypeptide<br>
molecules involved in signal transduction processes are<br>
typically receptor and non-receptor protein kinases,<br>
receptor and non-receptor protein phosphatases, nucleotide<br>
exchange factors, and transcription factors.<br>
The term "aberration", in conjunction with a signal<br>
transduction process, refers to a protein kinase that is<br>
over- or under-expressed in an organism, mutated such that<br>
its catalytic activity is lower or higher than wild-type<br>
protein kinase activity, mutated such that it can no longer<br>
interact with a natural binding partner, is no longer<br>
modified by another protein kinase or protein phosphatase,<br>
or no longer interacts with a natural binding partner,<br>
 The term "promoting or disrupting the abnormal<br>
interaction" refers to a method that can be accomplished by<br>
administering a compound of the invention to cells or<br>
tissues in an organism. A compound can promote an<br>
interaction between a protein kinase and natural binding<br>
partners by forming favorable interactions with multiple<br>
atoms at the complex interface. Alternatively, a compound<br>
can inhibit an interaction between a protein kinase and<br>
natural binding partners by compromising favorable<br>
interactions formed between atoms at the complex interface.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the invention relates<br>
to a method of preventing or treating an abnormal condition<br>
in an organism, where the serine/threonine protein kinase<br>
is RAF.<br>

The term "pharmaceutical composition" refers to a<br>
mixture of an azabenzimidazole compound of the invention<br>
with other chemical components, such as diluents or<br>
parriers . The pharmaceutical composition facilitates<br>
administration of the compound to an organism. Multiple<br>

well as stabilize the biologically active form of the<br>
compound. Salts dissolved in buffered solutions are<br>
utilized as diluents in the art. One commonly used<br>
buffered solution is phosphate buffered saline because it<br>
mimics the salt conditions of human blood. Since buffer<br>
salts can control the pH of a solution at low<br>
concentrations, a buffered diluent rarely modifies the<br>
biological activity of a compound.<br>

The summary of the invention described above is non-<br>
limiting and other features and advantages of the invention<br>
will be apparent from the following description of the<br>
preferred embodiments, and from the claims.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present invention is directed in part towards<br>
methods of modulating the function of serine/threpnine<br>
protein kinases with azabenzimidazole-based compounds. In<br>
addition, the invention relates in part to methods for<br>
identifying compounds that modulate the function of<br>
serine/threonine protein kinases. The methods incorporate<br>
cells that express a serine/threonine protein kinase, such<br>
as RAF.<br>
RAF is a non-receptor protein kinase that is recruited<br>
to the cell membrane when it binds to activated RAS, a<br>
guanine triphosphate hydrolyzing enzyme. RAS is activated<br>
when an activated receptor protein tyrosine kinase, such as<br>
EGFR or PDGFR, bind to an adaptor protein, GRB2, and a<br>
guanine nucleotide exchange factor, SOS. SOS removes<br>
guanine diphosphate from RAS, replaces it with guanine<br>
triphosphate, and thereby activates RAS. RAS then binds<br>
RAF and consequently activates RAF. RAF may then<br>
phosphorylate other protein targets on serine and threonine<br>
residues, such as the kinase (MEK) that phosphorylates and<br>
consequently activates mitogen-activated protein kinase<br>
(MAPK). Thus, RAF serves as an intermediary controlling<br>
factor in mitogen-activated signal transduction.<br>
Due to the important regulatory role of RAF in cells,<br>
modifications to the amino acid sequence of RAF can alter<br>
its function and consequently modify cellular behavior.<br>
RAF's role in cell proliferation is underscored by the<br>
observation that mutations to RAF's amino acid sequence<br>
have been associated with tumors and cancers. Because the<br>
mutations to RAF that give rise to cancer in cells lead to<br>
RAF molecules that display unregulated catalytic activity,<br>
inhibitors of RAF may alleviate or even abrogate the cell<br>
proliferation that leads to cancer in these cells.<br>
Methods of the present invention can detect compounds<br>
that modulate the function of the protein kinase RAF in<br>
cells. RAF phosphorylates a protein kinase (MEK) which in<br>
turn phosphorylates mitogen-activated protein kinase<br>
(MAPK). Assays that monitor only the phosphorylation of<br>
MEK by RAF are not sensitive because the phosphorylation<br>
levels of MEK are not significant. To overcome this<br>
sensitivity dilemma, the phosphorylation of both MEK and<br>
MAPK are followed in the assays of the present invention.<br>
The MAPK phosphorylation signal amplifies the MEK<br>
phosphorylation signal and allows RAF-dependent<br>
phosphorylation to be followed in enzyme-linked<br>
immunosorbant assays. In addition, the assay of the<br>
invention is preferrably performed in a high throughput<br>
format such that many compounds can be rapidly monitored in<br>
a short period of time.<br>
The methods of the present invention have identified<br>
compounds that inhibit the function of the RAF protein<br>
kinase. These compounds are azabenzimidazole-based<br>
derivatives. Although azabenzimidazole-based derivatives<br>
have been tested for their ability to inhibit enzymes<br>
involved with nucleotide synthesis in bacteria, many of<br>
these compounds have not yet been significantly explored<br>
with respect to protein kinase inhibition.<br>
Because RAF exhibits significant amino acid homology<br>
to other serine/threonine protein kinases, the<br>
azabenzimidazole-based compounds of the invention may<br>
likely inhibit serine/threonine protein kinases other than<br>
RAF. Thus, the methods of the invention also relate to<br>
serine/threonine protein kinases other than RAF, including<br>
receptor and non-receptor serine/threonine protein kinases.<br>
The methods of the invention also pertain to other<br>
compounds that modulate RAF function in cells as the high<br>
throughput aspect of the methods allows a wide array of<br>
molecules to be tested in a short period of time.<br>
Therefore, the methods of the invention can identify<br>
existing molecules not disclosed in the present invention<br>
that modulate STK function.<br>
I. Biological Activity of Azabenzimidazole—Based<br>
Compounds<br>
Azabenzimidazole-based compounds of the present<br>
invention were tested for their ability to inhibit RAF<br>
protein kinase function. The biological assays and results<br>
of these inhibition studies are reported herein. The<br>
methods used to measure azabenzimidazole-based compound<br>
modulation of protein kinase function are similar to those<br>
described in U.S. Application Serial No. 08/702,232, by<br>
Tang et al., and entitled "Indolinone Combinatorial<br>
Libraries and Related Products and Methods for the<br>
Treatment of Disease," (Lyon &amp; Lyon Docket No. 221/187),<br>
filed August 23, 1996, with respect to the high throughput<br>
aspect of the method. The 08/702,232 application is<br>
incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, including<br>
any drawings.<br>
II. Target Diseases to be Treated by Azabenzimidazole-<br>
Based Compounds<br>
The methods, compounds, and pharmaceutical.<br>
compositions described herein are designed to inhibit cell<br>
proliferative disorders by modulating the function of the<br>
RAF protein kinase. Proliferative disorders result in<br>
unwanted cell proliferation of one or more subsets of cells<br>
in a multicellular organism resulting in harm to the<br>
organism. The methods, compounds, and pharmaceutical<br>
compositions described herein may also be useful for<br>
treating and preventing other disorders in organisms, such<br>
as disorders related to premature cell death (i.e.,<br>
neurological diseases) or inflammation. These disorders<br>
may be a result of RAF molecules that function<br>
inappropriately or a result of RAF-related protein kinase<br>
molecules that function inappropriately.<br>
Alterations in the function of the RAF protein kinase<br>
or protein kinases related to RAF can lead to enhanced or<br>
decreased cell proliferative conditions evident in certain<br>
diseases. Aberrant cell proliferative conditions include<br>
cancers, fibrotic disorders, mesangial disorders, abnormal<br>
angiogenesis and vasculogenesis, wound healing,psoriasis,<br>
restenosis, and inflammation.<br>
Fibrotic disorders relate to the abnormal formation of<br>
the cellular extracellular matrix. An example of a<br>
fibrotic disorder is hepatic cirrhosis. Hepatic cirrhosis<br>
is characterized by an increased concentration of<br>
extracellular matrix constituents resulting in the<br>
formation of a hepatic scar. Hepatic cirrhosis can cause<br>
diseases such as cirrhosis of the liver.<br>
Mesangial cell proliferative disorders occur due to<br>
the abnormal proliferation of mesangial cells. Mesangial<br>
proliferative disorders include various human renal<br>
diseases, such as glomerulonephritis, diabetic nephropathy,<br>
malignant nephrosclerosis, thrombotic microangiopathy<br>
syndromes, transplant rejection, and glomerulopathies.<br>
Preferred types of cancers that may be treated by the<br>
methods and compounds of the invention are lung cancer,<br>
ovarian cancer, breast cancer, brain cancer, intra-axial<br>
brain cancer, colon cancer, prostate cancer, Kaposi's<br>
sarcoma, melanoma, and glioma. Evidence that the compounds<br>
and methods of the invention can effectively be utilized to<br>
stem and reverse the proliferation of cancer cells is<br>
provided herein by reference.<br>
Angiogenic and vasculogenic disorders result from<br>
excess proliferation of blood vessels. Blood vessel<br>
proliferation is necessary in a variety of normal<br>
physiological processes such as embryonic development,<br>
corpus luteum formation, wound healing and organ<br>
regeneration. However, blood vessel proliferation is also<br>
essential in cancer tumor development. Other examples of<br>
blood vessel proliferative disorders include arthritis,<br>
where new capillary blood vessels invade the joint and<br>
destroy cartilage. In addition, blood vessel proliferative<br>
diseases include ocular diseases, such as diabetic<br>
retinopathy, where new capillaries in the retina invade the<br>
vitreous, bleed and cause blindness. Conversely, disorders<br>
related to the shrinkage, contraction or closing of blood<br>
vessels, such as restenosis, are also implicated in adverse<br>
regulation of protein kinases.<br>
Moreover, vasculogenesis and angiogenesis are<br>
associated with the growth of malignant solid tumors and<br>
metastasis. A vigorously growing cancer tumor requires a<br>
nutrient and oxygen rich blood supply to continue growing.<br>
As a consequence, an abnormally large number of capillary<br>
blood vessels often grow in concert with the tumor and act<br>
as supply lines to the tumor. In addition to supplying<br>
nutrients to the tumor, the new blood vessels embedded in a<br>
tumor provide a gateway for tumor cells to enter the<br>
circulation and metastasize to distant sites in the<br>
organism. Folkman, 1990, J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 82:4-6.<br>
Inappropriate RAF activity can stimulate cell<br>
proliferative disorders. Molecules specifically designed<br>
to modulate the function of the RAF protein kinase have<br>
been shown to inhibit cellular proliferation.<br>
Specifically, antisense nucleic acid molecules, which are<br>
designed to both bind to message RNA encoding the RAF<br>
protein kinase and block translation from that message,<br>
effectively reversed transformation of A54 9 cells in vitro.<br>
Monia et al., 1996, Nature Medicine 2: 688, incorporated<br>
herein by reference in its entirety including all figures<br>
and tables. A54 9 cells are human malignant cells.<br>
These RAF-targeted antisense studies provide evidence<br>
that the azabenzimidazole molecules of the invention, which<br>
modulate the function of the RAF protein kinase, can stem,<br>
and likely reverse, the proliferation of malignant cells in<br>
an organism. These azabenzimidazole compounds can be<br>
tested in the in vitro methods provided herein by example.<br>
Furthermore, the azabenzimidazole compounds may be tested<br>
for their effect upon tumor cells in vivo by the xenograft<br>
methods also provided herein by example.<br>
There exist at least two ways in which inappropriate<br>
RAF activity can stimulate unwanted cell proliferation of a<br>
particular type of cells: (1) directly stimulating growth<br>
of the particular cell, or (2) increasing vascularization<br>
of a particular area, such as tumor tissue, thereby<br>
facilitating growth of the tissue.<br>
The use of the present invention is facilitated by<br>
first identifying whether the cell proliferation disorder<br>
is RAF driven. Once such disorders are identified,<br>
patients suffering from such a disorder can be identified<br>
by analysis of their symptoms using procedures well known<br>
to physicians or veterinarians of ordinary skill in the<br>
art. Such patients can then be treated as described<br>
herein.<br>
Determining whether the cell proliferation disorder is<br>
RAF driven may be accomplished by first determining the<br>
level of RAF activity occurring in the cell or in a<br>
particular location in a patient's body. For example, in<br>
the case of cancer cells the level of one or more RAF<br>
activities may be compared for non-RAF driven cancers and<br>
RAF driven cancers. If the cancer cells have a higher<br>
level of RAF activity than RAF driven cancers, preferably<br>
equal to or greater than RAF driven cancers, then they are<br>
candidates for treatment using the described RAF-modulating<br>
methods and compounds of the invention.<br>
In the case of cell proliferative disorders arising<br>
due to unwanted proliferation of non-cancer cells, the<br>
level of RAF activity is compared to that level occurring<br>
in the general population (e.g., the average level<br>
occurring in the general population of people or animals<br>
excluding those people or animals suffering from a cell<br>
proliferative disorder). If the unwanted cell<br>
proliferation disorder is characterized by a higher RAF<br>
level than occurring in the general population then the<br>
disorder is a candidate for treatment using the described<br>
RAF modulating methods and compounds of the invention.<br>
III. Pharmaceutical Compositions and Administration of<br>
Azabenzimidazole-Based Compounds<br>
Methods of preparing pharmaceutical formulations of<br>
the compounds, methods of determining the amounts of<br>
compounds to be administered to a patient, and modes of<br>
administering compounds to an organism are disclosed in<br>
U.S. Application Serial No. 08/702,232, by Tang et al., and<br>
entitled "Indolinone Combinatorial Libraries and Related<br>
Products and Methods for the Treatment of Disease," (Lyon &amp;<br>
Lyon Docket No. 221/187), filed August 23, 1996, and<br>
International patent publication number WO 96/22976, by<br>
Buzzetti et al., and entitled "Hydrosoluble 3-Arylidene-2-<br>
Oxindole Derivatives as Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors,"<br>
published August 1, 1996, both of which are incorporated<br>
herein by reference in their entirety, including any<br>
drawings. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that<br>
such descriptions are applicable to the present invention<br>
and can be easily adapted to it.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The examples below are non-limiting and are merely<br>
representative of various aspects and features of the<br>
present invention. The examples describe methods for<br>
synthesizing compounds of the invention and methods for<br>
measuring an effect of a compound on the function of the<br>
RAF protein kinase.<br>
The cells used in the methods are commercially<br>
available. The nucleic acid vectors harbored by the cells<br>
are also commercially available and the sequences of genes<br>
for the various protein kinases are readily accessible in<br>
sequence data banks. Thus, a person of ordinary skill in<br>
the art can readily recreate the cell lines in a timely •<br>
manner by combining the commercially available cells, the<br>
commercially available nucleic acid vectors, and the<br>
protein kinase genes using techniques readily available to<br>
persons of ordinary skill in the art.<br>

SYNTHETIC PROCEDURES<br>
Compound A-90: 2-Methoxycarbonylamino- (6-phenylmercapto.-3H-<br>
imidazo [4,5—b] pyridine<br>
2-amino-3-nitro-6-(phenylmercapto)pyridine was<br>
prepared by heating 2-amino-6-chloro-3-nitropyridine (84.0<br>
g, 0.484 mol) and sodium thiophenolate (Fluka) (72.0 g,<br>
0.545 mol) in 2-propanol (1500 mL) under reflux for 2<br>
hours. After cooling to room temperature the suspension<br>
was diluted with water (100 ml), the solid was collected by<br>
vacuum filtration, washed with water and 2-propanol, and<br>
dried at 50°C under vacuum to give 109.1 g (95 % yield) of<br>
2-amino-3-nitro-6-(phenylmercapto)pyridine, m.p. 148-152<br>
°C).<br>
2,3-Diamino-6-(phenylmercapto)pyridine was prepared by<br>
hydrogenating 2-amino-3-nitro-6-(phenylmercapto)pyridine<br>
(107.1 g, 0.433 mol) under 5 atm of H2 in the presence of<br>
30 g of Raney-Ni in 1200 mL of 2-propanol at 70°C. After 4<br>
hours (29.1 L of hydrogen) the reaction mixture was cooled<br>
to 4°C while stirring continuously. The precipitate was<br>
collected by vacuum filtration, washed with 2-propanol and<br>
dried at 50°C under vacuum. The combined filtrates were<br>
concentrated under reduced pressure and recrystallized from<br>
2-propanol. After washing the hydrogenation apparatus<br>
twice with 1000 mL of THF, evaporation under reduced<br>
pressure and recrystallization from 2-propanol, the<br>
precipitate was collected and dried at 50°C under vacuum to<br>
give 80.4 g (87.1 % yield) of 2,3-diamino-6-<br>
(phenylmercapto)pyridine, m.p. 119-122°C).<br>
2-Methoxycarbonylamino-6-phenylmercapto-3H-<br>
imidazo [4, 5-b]pyridine was prepared by adding methyl<br>
chloroformate (34 mL, 0.44 mol) dropwise to a cold (5-15°C)<br>
solution of S-methylisothiouronium sulphate (53 g, 0.19<br>
mol) (Aldrich) in 68 mL of water while the temperature was<br>
kept below 20°C. Afterwards, aqueous sodium hydroxide (116<br>
g, 25% NaOH) was added carefully and a white precipitate<br>
occured. After 20 minutes, water (210 mL) was added and<br>
the pH adjusted to 4.0 with acetic acid (glacial, 34 mL) .<br>
To this mixture a solution of 2,3-diamino-6-<br>
(phenylmercapto)pyridine (37.8 g, 0.174 mol) in 210 mL of<br>
ethanol was added dropwise and heated to 85-90°C for 2<br>
hours. After cooling the reaction mixture overnight, the<br>
precipitate was isolated by filtration, washed with warm<br>
water (1000 mL), dried and recrystallized from acetic acid<br>
and ethanol at 4 °C. The precipitate was collected by<br>
filtration, washed with methanol and dried at 50°C under<br>
vacuum to give 30 g (57.4 % yield) of 2-<br>
methoxycarbonylamino-6-phenylmercapto-3H-imidazo[4,5-<br>
b]pyridine, m.p. 269-274 °C (dec).<br>
Compound A-3: 2-Methoxycarbonylamino- (6-phenoxy-3H-<br>
imidazo [4,5-b]pyridine<br>
By substituting sodium phenolate in place of sodium<br>
thiophenolate in Example A-90, the identical process gives<br>
2-methoxycarbonylamino-(6-phenoxy-3H-imidazo[4,5-<br>
b]pyridine, m.p. &gt;280 °C (dec).<br>
Compound A-4: 2-Ethoxycarbonylamino—6-phenoxy-3H-<br>
imidazo [4,5-b]pyridine<br>
By substituting ethyl chloroformate in place of methyl<br>
chloroformate in Example A-3, the identical process gives<br>

Procedure<br>
All of the following steps were conducted at room<br>
temperature unless specifically indicated.<br>
1. ELISA plate coating: ELISA wells are coated with<br>
100 (aLof Sheep anti mouse affinity purified antiserum (1<br>
µg/100 µL coating buffer) over night at 4 °C. ELISA plates .<br>
can be used for two weeks when stored at 4 °C.<br>
2. Invert the plate and remove liquid. Add 100 µL<br>
of blocking solution and incubate for 30 min.<br>
3. Remove blocking solution and wash four times with<br>
wash buffer. Pat the plate on a paper towel to remove<br>
excess liquid.<br>
4. Add 1 µg of antibody specific, for RAF-1 to each<br>
well and incubate for 1 hour. Wash as described in step 3.<br>
5. Thaw lysates from RAS/RAF infected Sf9 cells and<br>
dilute with TBST to 10 µg/100 µL. Add 10 µg of diluted<br>
lysate to the wells and incubate for 1 hour. Shake the<br>
plate during incubation. Negative controls receive no<br>
lysate. Lysates from RAS/RAF infected Sf9 insect cells are<br>
prepared after cells are infected with recombinant<br>
baculoviruses at a MOI of 5 for each virus, and harvested<br>
48 hours later. The cells are washed once with PBS and<br>
lysed in RIPA buffer. Insoluble material is removed by<br>
centrifugation (5 min at 10 000 x g). Aliquots of lysates<br>
are frozen in dry ice/ethanol and stored at - 80 °C until<br>
use.<br>
6. Remove non-bound material and wash as outlined<br>
above (step 3).<br>
7. Add 2 µg of T-MEK and 2 µg of His-MAEPK per well<br>
and adjust the volume to 40 µL with kinase buffer. Methods<br>
for purifying T-MEK and MAPK from cell extracts are<br>
provided herein by example.<br>
8. Predilute compounds (stock solution 10 mg/mL<br>
DMSO) or extracts 20 fold in TBST plus 1% DMSO. Add 5 µL<br>
of the prediluted compounds/extracts to the wells described<br>
in step 6. Incubate for 20 min. Controls receive no drug.<br>
9. Start the kinase reaction by addition of 5 µL ATP<br>
mix; Shake the plates on an ELISA "plate shaker during<br>
incubation.<br>
10. Stop the kinase reaction after 60 min by addition<br>
of 30 µL stop solution to each well.<br>
11. Place the phosphocellulose mat and the ELISA<br>
plate in the Tomtec plate harvester. Harvest and wash the<br>
filter with the filter wash solution according to the<br>
manufacturers recommendation. Dry the filter mats. Seal<br>
the filter mats and place them in the holder. Insert the<br>
holder into radioactive detection apparatus and quantify<br>
the radioactive phosphorous on the filter mats.<br>
Alternatively, 40 µL aliquots from individual wells of<br>
the assay plate can be transferred to the corresponding<br>
Positions on the phosphocellulose filter mat. After air-<br>
drying the filters, put the filters in a tray. Gently rock<br>
the tray, changing the wash solution at 15 min intervals<br>
for 1 hour. Air-dry the filter mats. Seal the filter mats<br>
and place them in a holder suitable for measuring the<br>
radioactive phosphorous in the samples. Insert the holder<br>
into a detection device and quantify the radioactive<br>
phosphorous on the filter mats.<br>
IC50 values were measured according to the protocol<br>
for the following azabenzimidazole-based compounds in the<br>
RAF-1 ELISA assay:<br>
An IC50 value is the concentration of the azabenzimidazole-<br>
based inhibitor required to decrease the maximum amount of<br>
phosphorylated target protein or cell growth by 50%. The<br>
IC50 values measured in the RAF-1 phosphorylation assay are<br>
depicted in Table 1:<br>
EXAMPLE 3: PURIFICATION OF MAPK AND MEK<br>
The MAPK and MEK proteins are readily expressed in<br>
cells by sublconing a gene encoding these proteins into a<br>
commercially available vector that expresses the proteins<br>
with a poly-Histidine tag. Genes encoding these proteins<br>
are readily available from laboratories' that normally work<br>
with these proteins or by cloning these genes from cells<br>
containing cDNA libraries. The libraries are readily<br>
commercially available and a person skilled in the art can<br>
readily design nucleic acid probes homologous to cDNA<br>
molecules encoding MEK or MAPK from the nucleic acid<br>
sequences of MEK and MAPK, available in multiple gene data<br>
bases such as Genbank. The cloning of a gene can be<br>
accomplished in a short time period using techniques<br>
currently available to persons skilled in the art.<br>
Purification of the MEK and MAPK proteins from cell<br>
extracts can be accomplished using the following protocol,<br>
which is adapted from Robbins et al., 1993, J. Biol. Chem.<br>
268: 5097-5106:<br>
1. Lyse cells by sonication, osmotic stress, or<br>
French Press techniques readily available to persons<br>
skilled in the art. An appropriate sonication buffer is<br>
provided below.<br>
2. Equilibrate a solid support which is conjugated<br>
with nickel or cobalt with the equilibration buffer<br>
disclosed below. The poly-histidine tag specifically binds<br>
to the nickel and cobalt atoms on the solid support.<br>
Equilibration can be achieved by washing the resin three<br>
times with a volume of the equilibration buffer equal to<br>
ten times the volume of the solid support. The solid<br>
support is readily available to persons of ordinary skill<br>
in the art.<br>
3. Add the cell lysate to the solid support and<br>
equilibrate in a vessel for a period of time.<br>
Alternatively, the solid support can be packed within a<br>
protein chromatography column and the lysate may be flowed<br>
through the solid support.<br>
4. Wash the solid support with the wash buffer<br>
disclosed below.<br>
5. Elute the MEK or MAPK protein from the solid<br>
support with an amount of elution buffer (provided below)<br>
that removes a significant portion of the protein from the<br>
solid support.<br>
