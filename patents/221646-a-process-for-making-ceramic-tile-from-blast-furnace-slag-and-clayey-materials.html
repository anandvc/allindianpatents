				<td>The present invention relates to a process for making ceramic tiles from Mast furnace slag and clayey materials for use such as floor tile, wall tile and kitchen table top. The main application of the Mast furnace slag based floor tiles are in the field of consumer product where non-porous, decorative and hygienic surfaces are required ki a residential, office or public places and chemical plants particularly in toilets and kitchens, acid handling units and in hospitals and medical centres. High thermal shock resistance of the material suggests its use as kitchen table top and in similar situations. The present day method of making ceramic tiles essentially consists of using clay, quartz, flux and minor ingredients including colouring agents for which reference may be made to P. Mishra, "Production of mono-line glazed ceramic floor tiles" in Trans, fad. Ccram. Soc., vol. 46(2), 60-62(1987) or clay, fly ash and cinder mixtures for which reference may be made to S. Chakrabarti, S. Ghosh, M. Das and A. Kumar "Development of floor tiles from Oangetic Silt based Common clay, fly ash and cinder mixture" in Indian journal of Engineers, Annual number 92 leading to a product that requires glazing over its surface to reduce moisture absorption as well as to impart decoration to the article, fa all the conventional processes the main drawbacks may be listed as follows.<br>
1. The process uses raw materials of depleting reserve. 2. Compositional variations of products are necessary for different applications.<br>
3.	Physical  properties  like  abrasion   resistance,  thermal  shock<br>
resistance and impact resistance are low.<br>
4.	Articles requires glazing thus increases the cost of production.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for making ceramic tiles from blast furnace slag and clayey materials for use as floor tiles, wall tile and kitchen table top which obviates the drawbacks as detailed above.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to use an industrial waste, blast furnace slag, as one of the major raw materials.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to make a product that suits different purposes.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to make a product with better physical properties.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to impart glossiness to one surface of the article without glazing. Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for making ceramic tile from blast furnace slag and clayey materials which comprises grinding water quenched granulated iron blast furnace slag such as herein described, sieving through 100 mesh BS, mixing by conventional manner the obtained slag material with<br>
clayey matter selected from common clay, china clay, fire clay, purophillite and talc, wherein weight proportion of slag material to clayey material is in the range of 90 : 10 to 10 : 90, producing a slurry from the obtained mixture, filtering the slurry through a 100 mesh BS, drying the filtered slurry at a temperature in the range of 110+5°C to get dried lump, disintegrating the dried lump by passing through 60 mesh, adding water in the range of 3 - 10 wt%, a binder preferably polyvinyl alcohol, carboxymethyl cellulose in the range of 0.02 to 0.2 wt%, granulating the dried lumps passing through 20 mesh BS and keeping for a period in the range of 6 to 24 hrs. for ageing, pressing the moistened granules to form tiles under a pressure in the range of 150 - 250 kg/cm2, drying the green tiles at a temperature in the range of 110 + 5°C to reduce the moisture content of the tiles to below 0.5%, firing the tiles at a temperature in the range of 950°C to 1300°C for a period in the range of 2 - 4 hours and polishing one side of the fired tile.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the water quenched granulated blast furnace slag used may be such as obtained directly from iron making units as water quenched blast furnace slag or unquenched blast furnace slag directly obtained from the steel plant and re melting the same and quenched.<br><br>
The details of the present inveuton are given below.<br>
a)	Water quenched granulated blast fumace slag or remelted blast furnace stag is<br>
washed with water.<br>
b)	Washed material from step 'a1 is ground by known process such as pot milling, ball<br>
c)	Milled Material from step 'b' is sieved through 100 BS.<br>
d)	Material obtained in step 'c1 is mixed Ground quenched granulated slag/re melted<br>
slag is mixed with clayey matter in wide ranging compositions such as 90wt.% slag and<br>
10wt.% clayey matter to 10 wt.% slag and 90wt.% clayey matter.<br>
e)	The mixed material described in step 'd' is milled in pot null with water for a period<br>
in the range of 2-12 hours.<br>
f)	The shiny produced in step V is passed through 100 mesh BS<br>
g)	The shiny produced in step T is dried at 110 ± 5nC to diyitess.<br>
h) The dried lump produced in step 'g' is disintrigrated and passed through 60 mesh BS and moistened with wate in the range of 3-10 wt.% water and binder in the range of 0.02 - 0.2 wt.% of total solid content and granulated by known method such as passing through 20 mesh BS and kept for a period hi the range of 6-24 hi*, for ageing.<br>
i) The aged material is pressed to form tiles of desired dimensions under a pressure in<br>
the range of 150-2 50 Kg/cm* pressure.<br>
j) The pressed tiles are dried at 110±5°C to reduce moisture content below 0.5%.<br>
k) The dried tiles are fired at a temperature in the range of 950 - 1300°C for a period<br>
in the range of 2-4 hours.<br>
1) One side of the tile is polished.<br>
The process of the present invention can be used to produce ceramic tics from blast furnace slag and clayey materials for use as floor tiles, wall tile and kitchen table top . Blast furnace slag contains silica, alumina and calcium oxides as principal constituents which ranges in 25-40% , 5-35% and 30-50% by weight respectively. Magnesium oxide content may vary from 1-25% by weight. The composition depends on the source and process of iron making. Unquenched slag contains crystalline phases gehlinite(2CaO.Al2O3 SiO2) and akermanite (2CaO. MgO. 2 SiO2) along with Merwinite (3CaO. MgO. 2 SiO2) and di calcium silicate (2 CaO. SiOj) However, quenched material is principally glass (70-95%) of large viscosity at fusion range, hi corporation of clay in the original batch composition results in overall increase in silica and reduction of alumina and lime.<br>
