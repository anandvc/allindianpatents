				<td>DYING OR BLEACHING APPARATUS FOR YARN WOUND ON REELS OR SIMILAR PACKAGES.<br>
The present invention refers to a dying or bleaching<br>
apparatus for yarn wound on reels or similar packages.<br>
Traditional dying or bleaching apparatuses for yarn<br>
consist of a vertical boiler, equipped with a pump and<br>
devices for the reversible circulation of a treatment<br>
liquid. Such apparatuses have a universal use since<br>
they are suitable for receiving material holders for<br>
the different possible packages of yarn.<br>
Specifically  just  for  reels  or  similar  packages,<br>
special apparatuses consisting of a series of small<br>
horizontal boilers, arranged one next to the other or<br>
one. on top of the other, so as to form a parallelepiped<br>
structure are alternatively used.<br>
Each of these small boilers can receive a reel holder<br>
shaft which usually has a tubular structure. Such a<br>
shaft,  for constructive cost-effectiveness, generally<br>
carries from ten to twelve reels,  according to the<br>
length of their perforated support.<br>
These apparatuses,  with respect  to the  traditional<br>
ones, have the advantage of operating with a very short<br>
soaking  ratio  and  moreover  they  need  neither  an<br>
installation space nor a hoist to move it.<br>
However, they have a series of problems regarding dying<br><br>
quality, practicality of the reel loading and unloading operations, and moving the reel holder shafts in general.<br>
Indeed, the operator must slot in the reels one above the other on the individual shafts arranged with their axis vertical. Since the small boilers are horizontal, to slot in such shafts, which are loaded with reels and are therefore very heavy, it is first of all necessary to position them with their axes horizontal on a trolley.<br>
Such shafts are very long due to the large number of reels which they receive and they essentially consist of a perforated tube. Such a tube has a base hole and is perforated, on its surface, in a differentiated manner along its length in order to try to make the passage of the liquid uniform on the individual reels arranged n said shafts.<br>
Nevertheless, abundantly and uniformly wetting the large number of reels arranged on the shafts presents substantial difficulties; moreover, it is very probable that some reels have a substantially different density to the others, thus contributing to unevening the wetting passage.<br>
For this reason and for others inherent to the circulation system of the dying liquid, these apparatuses are not advised for dying very compact<br><br>
reels, for example those with cotton or viscose yarn, in particular fine yarns intended for fabrics or knitted fabrics of a single colour.<br>
They are, therefore, complex apparatuses, with an irrational and unpractical liquid circulation, which require many manipulations of the yarn; moreover, they are expensive, they are difficult and expensive to automate, and in particular they are not very reliable in dying.<br>
It is, therefore, clear that, apart from the advantage of  the  reduction  of  the  soaking  ratio,  these apparatuses certainly do not represent current dying industry expectations for a dying or bleaching device for yarn wound on reels or similar packages. If the environmentally-friendly aspect is gained thanks to the short  soaking  ratio  with  which  the  aforementioned apparatuses operate, there is a lack in the aspects regarding the reduction of yarn manipulations, in order to reduce the impact of the workforce costs, and those linked to practicality, operative flexibility, ease of automation and above all the possibility of treating any fibre with absolute confidence.<br>
As far as the manipulations are concerned, it is useful to recall  that which the  complete operating cycle foresees.  It  comprises  the  loading of  the  reels, slotted one above the other, on the individual shafts<br><br>
arranged vertically, the rotation of these shafts until a horizontal position is reached/  transferring these shafts onto a loading trolley which carries the shafts in a horizontal position, positioning and clamping the trolley  to  the  structure  of  the  dying  apparatus, pushing the shafts into the individual small boilers, detaching  and  removing  the  loading  trolley,  dying treatment  in  the  small  boilers,  repositioning  and clamping the trolley to the structure of the apparatus, removing the shafts from the individual small boilers, detaching the  trolley,  repositioning  the  individual shafts vertically, removing the reels from the shafts, dipping the reels in a water-draining apparatus, water-draining treatment to drain the maximum possible amount, of water from the reels, removing the reels from the water-draining apparatus,  loading the reels on the shafts of the trolley for the dryer, introducing the trolley into the dryer, drying the reels, removing the trolley with the end load of treated and dried reels. It is therefore clear how the modern dying industry needs apparatuses which allow a reduction,  if not elimination, of the manipulations of yarn in some steps of the aforementioned productive cycle, simplifying it with a consequent reduction in the production costs. Another requirement, which is urgently demanded by the market, should be added to the above, that being an<br><br>
ever more flexible use of these apparatuses, understood in the sense of being able to use them not just at full capacity but also/ according to requirements, partly full, and this, of course, with a virtually constant soaking ratio.<br>
The purpose of the present invention is that of realising a dying or bleaching apparatus for yarn wound on reels or similar packages, which allows the manipulations to be carried out to be minimised as far as possible.<br>
Another purpose of the present invention is that of realising a dying or bleaching apparatus for yarn wound on reels or similar packages, which guarantees good treatment  results,  with  a  uniform  and  abundant treatment liquid passage in each package. Another purpose of the present invention is that of realising a dying or bleaching apparatus which uses a very short soaking ratio,  reducing atmospheric and environmental pollution and energy costs accordingly. Yet another purpose of the present invention is that of realising a dying or bleaching apparatus which allows a good flexibility of use, maintaining a constant soaking ratio as the load of material to be treated varies. A further purpose of the present invention is that of realising a particularly simple and functional dying or bleaching apparatus at a contained cost.<br><br>
These purposes according to the present invention are achieved by realising a dying or bleaching apparatus for yarn wound on reels or similar packages/ as outlined in claim 1.<br>
Further characteristics are foreseen in the dependent claims.<br>
The  characteristics  and  advantages  of  a dying  or bleaching apparatus for yarn wound on reels or similar packages,  according  to  the  present  invention  shall become clearer from the following description, given as an example and not for limiting purpose, referring to the attached schematic drawings in which: figure 1 is a side elevational section view of a dying or  bleaching  apparatus  for  yarn  wound  on  reels, according to the present invention,  consisting of a plurality of small vertical treatment boilers, arranged on a circumference and each containing a reel holder shaft;<br>

figure 7 shows a. plan view from above of the apparatus of figure 1 without the cover, where the plurality of small boilers can be seen, the axes of which are arranged on a single circumference.<br>
Before anything else it must be said that only those parts of a dying apparatus which are essential for a complete understanding of the invention are illustrated in the drawings and shall be described hereafter,<br><br>
whereas all accessories, such as command and control equipment, which can be realised in a traditional manner which are well known in the prior art have been left out.<br>
Moreover, reference shall always be made to a dying apparatus, but it is to be understood that it could also concern apparatuses for bleaching or for other treatments.<br>
With reference to the figures, a dying apparatus, with a short soaking ratio, equipped with a plurality of small vertical boilers 15 is shown wholly indicated with 10.<br>
Such an apparatus 10 comprises a cylinder-shaped structure 65 with a vertical axis, rested on supports 22. On the inside of such a structure 65, near to the two bases of the cylinder, a lower ring 66 and an upper ring 67 are welded which support a plurality of small cylinder-shaped treatment boilers 15 with a vertical axis, the axes of which are arranged on a single inner circumference of the structure 65, concentric with its axis, as can be seen in figure 7.<br>
The small cylindrical boilers 15 are equipped with a base 48 and are open at the top. They are closed through a series of circular covers 11, mounted on an annular covering structure 50, and arranged with the centres on a single circumference. Such a circumference<br><br>
is the same as the one on which the axes of the small boilers 15 are arranged.<br>
The annular structure 50 is supported at its centre by an end of a lever 51, pivoted with a pin 43. The lever 51 is actuated by a flip-over cylinder 20, applied to the other end. Moreover, the structure 50 is axially equipped with a cylinder 21.<br>
A device for circulating a dying liquid, according to the direction indicated by arrows 46, is foreseen. The device comprises in order, as seen in figure 4, an outer pump 16, a heat exchanger 17 for cooling and heating the liquid, and a flow inverter 60 arranged on the axis of the apparatus 10. The flow inverter 60 is connected to each small boiler 15 with two pipings 70 and 70'.<br>
The base 48 of each small boiler 15 is equipped at the centre with a cylindrical sump 49. The sump, at a lower end, is connected to the piping 70. On the other end, on the other hand, it terminates with inverted cone-shaped seats 25'.<br>
Such seats host a conical lower end 25, which can be seen in figure 2, of reel holder shafts 13, on which reels 12 to be treated are slotted. In the case of figure 2 the reels 12 are wound on conical perforated supports and are separated by spacer disks 26. In the case of reels 12 wound on special cylindrical<br><br>
perforated supports the disks 26 can also be left out. Figure 2 shows a circular device 14 for moving all of the  shafts  13  arranged  around  the  circumference/ comprising a structure 32 which carries attachments for locking all the shafts 13, each consisting of a pair of small pistons 27, or of other known systems, which push two pincers 28 in correspondence with a grooved upper end 23 - which can be seen in figures 3a and 3b - of the shaft 13.<br>
In figure 3a and 3b a detail of a lock of a cover 11 on an upper edge of a small boiler 15 is shown. On each cover 11 locking and centring devices of the shafts 13 are foreseen. Such devices consist of a pin 30, equipped with a spring 31, which terminates with a conical seat 29, suitable for receiving the shaft 13 which terminates on top with a countersink 24. In figure 4 a diagram of a treatment liquid circulation is shown, with small boilers 15 of the apparatus 10 alternately filled with reel holder shafts 13.  The small boilers 15 which do not contain the shafts 13 are shut off from the circulation through valves 55 and 55' which intercept the tubes 70 and 70'.<br>
Figure 5 shows, under a crane 35, a dying line consisting of a trolley 36 which carries a series of shafts 13, arranged on a circumference, of the dying apparatus 10, of a centrifugal water draining apparatus<br><br>
with beehive hoists or perforated tubes 37 and of a drier with a chamber having a circular section 38. In figures 6a, 6b and 6c other embodiments of the dying line are shown, in which, in addition with respect to figure 5, a traditional drier with a chamber having a rectangular section 40,  a traditional water draining apparatus  41,  and  a  rectangular  trolley  42  which carries a series of fixed shafts, should be noted. The  reels  12  to  be  dyed,  wound  on  the  conical perforated supports, are slotted into the shafts 13, separated by disks 26. These shafts 13 are positioned on the trolley to then,  all together,  through the device 14, be loaded into the dying apparatus 10. In particular, said shafts 13 are positioned in the small boilers 15, which, as can be seen in figure 1, have an inner diameter which is slightly greater than the maximum diameter of the reels 12.<br>
The circumferential series of seats 25' are sized to receive the conical lower ends 25 of the shafts 13. Advantageously, a series of shafts 13, in the example in the figure there are twenty, can be positioned simultaneously, to fill all of the small boilers 15, by using the moving device 14.<br>
Such a device 14 has a circular structure 32 which comprises a series of pairs, one for each shaft 13, of small pistons 27, or. other known means, arranged along<br><br>
the same circumference as the one which passes through the centre of the small boilers 15. The small pistons 27 can be actuated to clamp or release the grooved upper end 23 of the shafts 13 themselves, through the pincers 28,  connected through levers to the small pistons 27, which can engage in the grooved ends 23. As can be seen in figure 5, the device 14 clamps all of the shafts 13 arranged around the circumference for example on the trolley 36, on the same circumference as the one which passes through the centre of the small boilers 15, and lowers them from above into the dying apparatus through the crane 35.<br>
Once the shafts 13 are inserted in the seats 25' , the covering structure 50 is closed with two distinct movements, actuated by the two cylinders 20 and 21. The cylinder 20 actuates a flip-over of the lever 51 about the pin 43, into a position indicated in figure 3a.<br>
Then the cylinder 21 carries out the axial lowering of the structure 50 which carries the individual covers 11, so as to allow a simultaneous closing of all of the small boilers 15 of the apparatus 10. In this step the locking of the shafts 13 in their positions also takes place. This is carried out through devices formed by the pins 30, which terminate with conical seats 29: when closed, shown in figure 3b, said conical seats 29<br><br>
are forced by the compressed springs 31 towards the upper countersink 24 of the shafts 13/ thus obtaining the locking and also the centring, thanks to their conical shape.<br>
The mechanical and airtight closing of the small boilers 15 is carried out by locking the individual covers 11 at the upper edges 44 through known means. As can be clearly seen in figure 1, the inside of the small boilers 15 has practically no dead zones when the shafts 13 are arranged in it.<br>
Alternatively, partial loads of the dying apparatus 10 are possible, using just a part of the small boilers 15 and shutting off the empty small boilers 15 from the liquid circulation, through the valves 55 and 55' . Different partially loaded situations are thus obtained.<br>
After the quoted closing of the covers 11, the small boilers 15 are filled with the dying liquid. Through the outer pump 16 a circulation of the liquid is promoted, also with the possibility of inverting the direction of the flow in the tubes 70 and 70' through the inverter 60.<br>
The inverter 60 is fed by a piping 19, coming from the heat exchanger 17. Such an inverter 60 is equipped with a known device for addressing the flow inside the boilers 15 through the tubes 70 or 71, according to the<br><br>
desired circulation direction. The flow then crosses the boilers 15 and, through the tubes 71 or 70, respectively, returns to the inverter 60, from which it proceeds towards the pump 16, through a piping 18. The dying liquid is heated or cooled through the heat exchanger 17.<br>
With the dying apparatus 10 it is also possible to rationalise production. Regarding this, in figure 5 and figure 6a a dying line is represented which foresees a trolley 36 where the shafts 13  are circumferentially arranged with the reels to be treated. These shafts 13 are picked up by the crane  35 which lowers  them, through the moving device 14, into the dying apparatus 10. After the cycle in the apparatus 10, the series of shafts 13 is picked up by the moving device 14 and is lowered into the centrifugal water draining apparatus 37,  which  can  be  with  a  beehive  hoist  or  with perforated tubes,  of a suitable  size  to host  the circumferential series of shafts 13. At the end of this step,  the moving device 14 picks up the series of shafts 13 and lowers them into the drier 38, which has a chamber with a circular section of a suitable size for hosting the circumferential series of shafts 13, where the process is completed.<br>
Alternatively,  in  figure  6b  the  production  line includes, with respect to figure 6a,  instead of the<br><br>
drier with a chamber having a circular section 38, a traditional drier 40 with a chamber having a rectangular section, for which reason, at the exit from the centrifugal water draining apparatus 37, the circumferential series of shafts 13 is picked up by the moving device 14 and is rested on a trolley 36, which is then taken into the drier 40.<br>
In another alternative,  in figure 6c the production line includes, with respect to figure 6a, a traditional water draining apparatus 41 and a traditional drier 40 with a chamber having a rectangular section, for which reason,  at the exit of the dying apparatus 10,  the circumferential series of shafts 13 is picked up by the moving device 14 and is rested upon a trolley 36. From the trolley 36 the individual reels 12 are withdrawn from the shafts 13 and are positioned, manually or mechanically,   in  the  traditional  water  draining apparatus 41. At the end of the water-draining step the individual  reels  12  are  picked up  and  arranged, manually or mechanically, on a trolley 42, which is then taken into the traditional drier 40 with a chamber having a rectangular section, to conclude the treatment process.<br>
It  should be  noted  that  the  engineering  solution realised in figure 6a is of course the optimal one, because it reduces the manipulations of the reels 12 in<br><br>
the production cycle to the minimum.<br>
The  advantage  which  characterises  this  particular embodiment of the dying apparatus with a plurality of small vertical boilers is that of receiving the reels to be dyed on individual removable reel holder shafts, arranged on a single circumference. Such shafts can all be removed simultaneously through a circular device with pneumatic pincers, or another known means,  and which can therefore be positioned, without intermediate manipulations,   firstly  in  the  centrifugal  water draining apparatus with a beehive hoist or perforated tubes and then in the drier with a circular chamber. For this last drying operation, it is very important that the residual humidity of the yarn after the water draining is uniform in all the reels and this, in the case of the apparatus of the present invention,  is guaranteed by the fact that the reel holder shafts are arranged on a single circumference, a thing which is not possible in traditional apparatuses or in those with horizontal small boilers.<br>
A  further  advantage  is  the  rationalisation  of production, since the manual transfer operations of the reels from the dying apparatus to the water draining apparatus, and from here to the drier are eliminated. In practice,  therefore,  the entire batch is dyed, centrifuged    and    dried    without    intermediate<br><br>
manipulations of the reels.<br>
Regarding this, the arrangement of the reel holder shafts on a single circumference simplifies enormously the possible automation with robots of the initial loading operation and of the final unloading of the individual reels from the shafts.<br>
The use of the apparatus also with empty small boilers, in a number from two up to about half of the total (arranged symmetrically with respect to the centre to allow a subsequent balanced use of the shafts in the centrifugal  water  draining  apparatus),  allows  the maximum  productive   capacity   to   be   fractioned, maintaining the soaking ratio virtually constant: the operative flexibility is therefore at its maximum. Finally,   to   treat   large   batches,   apparatuses constructed with a modular structure can be realised, combining or twinning many dying apparatuses according to the present invention.<br>
Moreover, the dying apparatus object of the present invention, still keeping the essential special characteristics of traditional apparatuses, that is working totally full and with inversion of the direction of the circulation liquid, not only substantially reduces its soaking ratio, but furthermore improves its dying capability. This has been made possible thanks to the innovative<br><br>
arrangement, vertical and circumferential, of the small dying boilers, which practically have no dead zones. The  reduction  of  the  soaking  ratio  leads  to  the simultaneous  reduction in water,  energy,  steam and chemical  product   consumption   and   in  polluting atmospheric and environmental discharges. Moreover, the treatment times are reduced since, with the same flow rate of the pump and with the same heat exchange   surface   with   respect   to   traditional apparatuses, due to the substantial reduction in the bath volume, increase its cycles per minute as well as its temperature rise gradient, and thus in theory, and compatibly with the characteristic lifetime curves of dyes,  the  treatment  times  reduce.  Moreover,  the increase in the cycles per minute also involves an improvement of the dying capabilities.<br>
The dying apparatus thus conceived is susceptible to modifications and variants, all covered by the invention; moreover, all of the details can be replaced by technically equivalent elements. In practice, the materials used, as well as the sizes, can be whatever-according to the technical requirements.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
