				<td>DIMENSIONALITY STABLE SOLID RINSE AID<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Mechanical warewashing machines have been common in the institutional<br>
and household environments for many years. Such automatic warewashing machines<br>
clean dishes using two or more cycles which can include initially a wash cycle<br>
followed by a rinse cycle, but may also utilize soak, pre-wash, scrape, sanitizing,<br>
drying, and additional wash cycles. Rinse agents are conventionally used in<br>
warewashing applications to promote drying and to prevent the formation of spots.<br>
In order to reduce the formation of spotting, rinse agents have commonly<br>
been added to water to form an aqueous rinse that is sprayed on the dishware after<br>
cleaning is complete. The precise mechanism through which rinse agents work is<br>
not established. One theory holds that the surfactant in the rinse agent is absorbed<br>
on the surface at temperatures at or above its cloud point, and thereby reduces the<br>
solid-liquid interfacial energy and contact angle. This leads to the formation of a<br>
continuous sheet which drains evenly from the surface and minimizes the formation<br>
of spots. Generally, high foaming surfactants have cloud points above the<br>
temperature of the rinse water, and, according to this theory, would not promote<br>
sheet formation, thereby resulting in spots. Moreover, high foaming materials are<br>
known to interfere with the operation of warewashing machines.<br>
In some cases, defoaming agents have been used in an attempt to promote<br>
the use of high foaming surfactants in rinse aids. In theory, the defoaming agents<br>
may include surfactants with a cloud point at or below the temperature of the rinse<br>
water, and would thereby precipitate out and modify the air/liquid interface and<br>
destabilize the presence of foam that may be created by the high foaming surfactants<br>
in the rinse water. However, in many cases, it has been difficult to provide suitable<br>
combinations of high foaming surfactants and defoamers to achieve desired results.<br>
For example, for certain high foaming surfactants, it has often been necessary to<br>
provide defoaming agents that are chemically quite complicated. For example,<br>
Published International Patent Application No. W089/11525 discloses an ethoxylate<br>
defoamer agent that is capped with an alkyl residue.<br>
A number of rinse aids are currently known, each having certain advantages<br>
and disadvantages. There is an ongoing need for alternative rinse aid compositions,<br>
especially alternative rinse aid compositions that are environmentally friendly (e.g.,<br>
biodegradable), and that essentially include components that are suitable for use in<br>
food service industries, e.g. GRAS ingredients (generally recognized as safe by the<br>
USFDA, partial listing available at 21 C.F.R. §§ 184).<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
A solid rinse agent composition of the present invention includes a<br>
solidification system including sodium sulfate and urea, and sheeting agent<br>
including one or more alcohol ethoxylates. The solid rinse aid composition may<br>
advantageously be formulated to phosphate-free and aminocarboxylate-free, as well<br>
as containing only ingredients generally recognized as safe (GRAS) for human<br>
consumption.<br>
In at least some embodiments, the solid rinse aid may generally include a<br>
sheeting agent component comprising one or more alcohol ethoxylates that include<br>
an alkyl group that includes 12 or fewer carbon atoms and is a solid at room<br>
temperature. For example, in some embodiments, the rinse aid can include a<br>
sheeting agent component including one or more alcohol ethoxylates having the<br>
general formula:<br>
R-O-(CH2CH2O)n-H<br>
wherein R is a (C1-C12) alkyl group, and n is an integer in the range of 1 to 100. The<br>
rinse aid can also include an effective amount of defoamer component configured<br>
for reducing the stability of foam that may be created by the alcohol ethoxylate in an<br>
aqueous solution.<br>
Some embodiments of the inventive solid rinse aid composition also include<br>
a GRAS preservative system for acidification of the solid rinse aid including sodium<br>
bisulfate and organic acids. In at least some embodiments, a use solution of the<br>
solid rinse aid has a pH that is less than pH 4, and often less than pH 2.<br>
Some example methods, including heating and vigorous mixing are<br>
described for processing the rinse aid compositions, generally include the steps of<br>
combining the sheeting component, defoamer, sodium sulfate, urea, and, if desired,<br>
any other suitable additives so as to produce the rinse aid. These steps are followed<br>
by casting, extruding, or the like to form solid product.<br>
The rinse aid can be provided as a concentrate or as a use solution. The rinse<br>
aid concentrate is typically provided in a solid form. In general, it is expected that<br>
the concentrate will be diluted with water to provide the use solution that is then<br>
supplied to the surface of a substrate. The use solution preferably contains an<br>
effective amount of active material to provide reduced water solids filming in rinse<br>
water. It should be appreciated that the term "active materials" refers to the<br>
nonaqueous portion of the use solution that functions to reduce spotting and water<br>
solids filming.<br>
Some example methods for using the rinse aid generally include the step of<br>
providing the rinse aid, mixing the rinse aid into an aqueous use solution, and<br>
applying the aqueous use solution to a substrate surface.<br>

A solid rinse agent composition of the present invention includes a<br>
solidification system including sodium sulfate and urea, and sheeting agent<br>
including comprising one or more alcohol ethoxylates. The solid rinse aid<br>
composition may advantageously be formulated to phosphate-free and<br>
aminocarboxylate-free, as well as containing only ingredients generally recognized<br>
as safe (GRAS) for human consumption.<br>
The invention provides a solid rinse aid composition including effective<br>
amounts of a solidification system including sodium sulphate and urea. The<br>
combination of sodium sulfate and urea has been found to add to performance of the<br>
solid rinse aid, at least by functioning as solidification agents. The combination of<br>
sodium sulfate and urea may also function as builders. The solid rinse aid<br>
composition typically has a melt point greater than 110°F and is dimensionally<br>
stable.<br>
The solid rinse aid generally includes an effective amount of sheeting agent<br>
including one or more alcohol ethoxylates that include an alkyl group that includes<br>
12 or fewer carbon atoms. Preferably, one or more of the alcohol ethoxylates are<br>
solid at room temperature. For example, in some embodiments, the rinse aid<br>
sheeting agent including one or more alcohol ethoxylates having the general<br>
formula:<br>
R-O-(CH2CH2O)n-H<br>
wherein R is a (C1-C12) alkyl group, and n is an integer in the range of 1 to 100.<br>
The rinse aid also generally includes an effective amount of defoamer<br>
component configured for reducing the stability of foam that may be created by the<br>
alcohol ethoxylate in an aqueous solution.<br>
Some embodiments of the inventive solid rinse aid composition also include<br>
a novel GRAS preservative system for acidification of the solid rinse aid including<br>
sodium bisulfate and organic acids. In at least some embodiments, the solid rinse<br>
aid has pH of 2.0 or less and the use solution of the solid rinse aid has a pH of at<br>
least pH 4.0.<br>
Typically, the solid rinse aid is formulated to include components that are<br>
suitable for use in food service industries, e.g., GRAS ingredients, a partial listing is<br>
available at 21 CFR 184. In some embodiments, the solid rinse aid is formulated to<br>
include only GRAS ingredients. In other embodiments, the solid rinse aid is<br>
formulated to include GRAS and biodegradable ingredients. In addition, the solid<br>
rinse aid may be formulated to be environmentally friendly by excluding phosphates<br>
and aminocarboxylates.<br>
The solid rinse aid compositions may also include other functional agents<br>
and active ingredients that will vary according to the type of rinse aid composition<br>
being manufactured in the solid matrix formed by the sodium sulfate and urea. The<br>
invention further provides methods for making solid rinse aid compositions,<br>
including effective amounts of sodium sulphate and urea in combination with<br>
alcohol ethoxylate sheeting agent.<br>
The rinse aid composition is provided as a solid. Typically, the solid rinse<br>
aid is provided as a solid block or pellet. It is expected that blocks will have a size<br>
of at least about 5 grams, and can include a size of greater than about 50 grams. For<br>
the purpose of this application the term "solid block" includes extruded pellet<br>
materials having a weight of 50 grams up through 250 grams, an extruded solid with<br>
a weight of about 100 grams or greater or a solid block rinse aid having a mass<br>
between about 1 and 10 kilograms.<br>
Solidification Agents<br>
The rinse aid composition includes an effective amount of a combination of<br>
sodium sulfate and urea for solidification. In general, an effective amount of<br>
effective amount of sodium sulfate and urea is considered an amount that acts with<br>
or without other materials to solidify the rinse aid composition. Typically, the<br>
combined amount of sodium sulfate and urea in a solid rinse aid composition is in a<br>
range of 18 to 70% by weight of the solid rinse aid composition, with 3-24 wt%<br>
sodium sulfate and 15-50 wt% urea. In other embodiments, the combined amount of<br>
sodium sulfate and urea is in a range of 10 to 50 wt%, with 5-18 wt% sodium sulfate<br>
and 5-45 wt% urea. In some instances, the combined amount of sodium sulfate and<br>
urea in a range of 20 to 37% by weight of the rinse aid composition, with 10-16 wt%<br>
sodium sulfate and 16-27 wt% urea. Sodium sulfate and urea are commercially<br>
available.<br>
The rinse aid composition hardens into solid form due to the chemical<br>
reaction of the ingredients with the sodium sulfate and urea. The solidification<br>
process may last from a few minutes to about four hours, depending, for example, on<br>
the size of the cast or extruded composition, the ingredients of the composition, the<br>
temperature of the composition, and other like factors. Typically, the rinse aid<br>
composition of the present disclosure exhibits extended mix time capability. Often,<br>
the cast or extruded composition "sets up" or begins to harden to a solid form within<br>
1 minute to about 3 hours. For example, the cast or extruded composition "sets up"<br>
or begins to harden to a solid form within a range of 1 minute to 2 hours. In some<br>
instances, the cast or extruded composition "sets up" or begins to harden to a solid<br>
form with a range of 1 minute to about 20 minutes.<br>
Water<br>
The solid rinse aid (i.e. solid concentrate) includes water. The warewashing<br>
composition can include water. Water many be independently added to the rinse aid<br>
composition or may be provided in the rinse aid composition as a result of its<br>
presence in an aqueous material that is added to the rinse aid composition. For<br>
example, materials added to the rinse aid composition include water or may be<br>
prepared in an aqueous premix available for reaction with the solidification agent<br>
component(s). Water introduced in the rinse aid composition during formation of<br>
the rinse aid composition may be removed or become water of hydration. Typically,<br>
water is introduced into the rinse aid composition to provide the detergent<br>
composition with a desired viscosity prior to solidification, and/or to provide a<br>
desired rate of solidification, and/or as a processing aid.<br>
In the solid rinse aid composition, the amount of water shall be in the range<br>
of 1 to 15 wt%, often in the range of 3 to 14 wt%, but may be 3-6 wt% water, or 6 to<br>
11 wt% water, or even 11 to 14 wt% water. It should be additionally appreciated<br>
that the water may be provided as deionized water or as softened water.<br>
Sheeting Agent<br>
The solid rinse aid composition includes sheeting agent. The sheeting agent<br>
of the solid rinse aid composition includes an effective amount of one or more<br>
alcohol ethoxylate compounds. Typically, the sheeting agent of the solid rinse aid<br>
composition includes an effective amount of one or more alcohol ethoxylate<br>
compounds that include an alkyl group that has 12 or fewer carbon atoms.<br>
Typically, the blend of one or more alcohol ethoxylate compounds in the sheeting<br>
agent is a solid at room temperature, for example by having a melting point equal to<br>
or greater than 100 °F, often greater than 110°F, and frequently in the range of<br>
110°F to 120°F. In at least some embodiments, alcohol ethoxylate compounds may<br>
each independently have structure represented by Formula I:<br>
R-O-(CH2CH2O)n-H (I)<br>
wherein R is a (C1-C12) alkyl group and n is an integer in the range of 1 to 100. In<br>
some embodiments, R may be a (C8-C12) alkyl group, or may be a (C8-C10) alkyl<br>
group. Similarly, in some embodiments, n is an integer in the range of 10-50, or in<br>
the range of 15-30, or in the range of 20-25. In some embodiments, the one or more<br>
alcohol ethoxylate compounds are straight chain hydrophobes.<br>
In at least some embodiments, the sheeting agent includes at least two<br>
different alcohol ethoxylate compounds each having structure represented by<br>
Formula I. In other words, the R and/or n variables of Formula I, or both, may be<br>
different in the two or more different alcohol ethoxylate compounds present in the<br>
sheeting agent. For example, the sheeting agent in some embodiments may include<br>
a first alcohol ethoxylate compound in which R is a (C8-C10) alkyl group, and a<br>
second alcohol ethoxylate compound in which R is a (C10-C12) alkyl group. In at<br>
least some embodiments, the sheeting agent does not include any alcohol ethoxylate<br>
compounds that include an alkyl group that has more than 12 carbon atoms. In some<br>
embodiments, the sheeting agent includes only alcohol ethoxylate compounds that<br>
include an alkyl group that has 12 or fewer carbon atoms.<br>
In some embodiments where, for example, the sheeting agent includes at<br>
least two different alcohol ethoxylate compounds, the ratio of the different alcohol<br>
ethoxylate compounds can be varied to achieve the desired characteristics of the<br>
final composition. For example, in some embodiments including a first alcohol<br>
ethoxylate compound and a second alcohol ethoxylate compound, the ratio of<br>
weight-percent first alcohol ethoxylate compound to weight-percent second<br>
compound may be in the range of about 1:1 to about 10:1 or more. For example, in<br>
some embodiments, the sheeting agent can include in the range of about 50% weight<br>
percent or more of the first compound, and in the range of about 50 weight percent<br>
or less of the second compound, and/or in the range of about 75 weight percent or<br>
more of the first compound, and in the range of about 25 weight percent or less of<br>
the second compound, and/or in the range of about 85 weight percent or more of the<br>
first compound, and in the range of about 15 weight percent or less of the second<br>
compound. Similarly, the range of mole ratio of the first compound to the second<br>
compound may be about 1:1 to about 10:1, and in some embodiments, in the range<br>
of about 3:1 to about 9:1.<br>
In some embodiments, the alcohol ethoxylates used in the sheeting agent can<br>
be chosen such that they have certain characteristics, for example, are<br>
environmentally friendly, are suitable for use in food service industries, and/or the<br>
like. For example, the particular alcohol ethoxylates used in the sheeting agent may<br>
meet environmental or food service regulatory requirements, for example,<br>
biodegradability requirements.<br>
Some specific examples of suitable sheeting agents that may be used include<br>
an alcohol ethoxylate combination including a first alcohol ethoxylate wherein R is a<br>
C10alkyl group and n is 21 (i.e. 21 moles ethylene oxide) and a second alcohol<br>
ethoxylate wherein R is a C12 alkyl group and again, n is 21 (i.e. 21 moles ethylene<br>
oxide). Such a combination can be referred to as an alcohol ethoxylate C10-12, 21<br>
moles EO In some particular embodiments, the sheeting agent may include in the<br>
range of about 85 wt. % or more of the C10 alcohol ethoxylate and about 15 wt. % or<br>
less of the C12 alcohol ethoxylate. For example, the sheeting agent may include in<br>
the range of about 90 wt. % of the C10 alcohol ethoxylate and about 10 wt. % of the<br>
C12 alcohol ethoxylate. One example of such an alcohol ethoxylate mixture is<br>
commercially available from Sasol under the tradename NOVEL II 1012-21.<br>
Alcohol ethoxylate surfactants are also described in U.S. Application Serial No.<br>
10/703,042, assigned to Ecolab, herein incorporated by reference.<br>
The sheeting agent can comprise a very broad range of weight percent of the<br>
entire composition, depending upon the desired properties. For example, for<br>
concentrated embodiments, the sheeting agent can comprise in the range of 1 to<br>
about 10 wt.-% of the total composition, in some embodiments in the range of about<br>
5 to about 25 wt.-% of the total composition, in some embodiments in the range of<br>
about 20 to about 50 wt.-% of the total composition, and in some embodiments in<br>
the range of about 40 to about 90 wt.-% of the total composition. For some diluted<br>
or use solutions, for example, aqueous use solutions, the sheeting agent can<br>
comprise in the range of 5 to about 60 ppm of the total use solution, in some<br>
embodiments in the range of about 50 to about 150 ppm of the total use solution, in<br>
some embodiments in the range of about 100 to about 250 ppm of the total use<br>
solution, and in some embodiments in the range of about 200 to about 500 ppm of<br>
the total use solution.<br>
Pefoamer Component<br>
The rinse aid composition can also include an effective amount of defoamer<br>
component configured for reducing the stability of foam that may be created by the<br>
alcohol ethoxylate sheeting agent in an aqueous solution. Any of a broad variety of<br>
suitable defoamers may be used, for example, any of a broad variety of nonionic<br>
ethylene oxide (EO) containing surfactants. Many nonionic ethylene oxide<br>
derivative surfactants are water soluble and have cloud points below the intended<br>
use temperature of the rinse aid composition, and therefore may be useful defoaming<br>
agents. In addition, where the solid rinse aid composition is preferred to be<br>
biodegradable, the defoamers are also selected to be biodegradable.<br>
While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that suitable nonionic<br>
EO containing surfactants are hydrophilic and water soluble at relatively low<br>
temperatures, for example, temperatures below the temperatures at which the rinse<br>
aid will be used. Tt is theorized that the EO component forms hydrogen bonds with<br>
the water molecules, thereby solublizing the surfactant. However, as the<br>
temperature is increased, these hydrogen bonds are weakened, and the EO<br>
containing surfactant becomes less soluble, or insoluble in water. At some point, as<br>
the temperature is increased, the cloud point is reached, at which point the surfactant<br>
precipitates out of solution, and functions as a defoamer. The surfactant can<br>
therefore act to defoam the sheeting agent component when used at temperatures at<br>
or above this cloud point.<br>
The cloud point of nonionic surfactant of this class is defined as the<br>
temperature at which a 1 wt-% aqueous solution. Therefore, the surfactant and/or<br>
surfactants chosen for use in the defoamer component can include those having<br>
appropriate cloud points that are below the intended use temperature of the rinse aid.<br>
Those of skill and the art, knowing the intended use temperature of the rinse aid, will<br>
appreciate surfactants with appropriate cloud points for use as defoamers.<br>
For example, there are two general types of rinse cycles in commercial<br>
warewashing machines. A first type of rinse cycle can be referred to as a hot water<br>
sanitizing rinse cycle because of the use of generally hot rinse water (about 180° F).<br>
A second type of rinse cycle can be referred to as a chemical sanitizing rinse cycle<br>
and it uses generally lower temperature rinse water (about 120° F). A surfactant<br>
useful as a defoamer in these two conditions is one having a cloud point less than the<br>
rinse water temperature. Accordingly, in this example, the highest useful cloud<br>
point, measured using a 1 wt-% aqueous solution, for the defoamer is approximately<br>
180° F or less. It should be understood, however, that the cloud point can be lower<br>
or higher, depending on the use locus water temperature. For example, depending<br>
upon the use locus water temperature, the cloud point may be in the range of about 0<br>
to about 100° C. Some examples of common suitable cloud points may be in the<br>
range of about 50° C to about 80°C, or in the range of about 60° C to about 70° C.<br>
Some examples of ethylene oxide derivative surfactants that may be used as<br>
defoamers include polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene block copolymers, alcohol<br>
alkoxylates, low molecular weight EO containing surfactants, or the like, or<br>
derivatives thereof. Some examples of polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene block<br>
copolymers include those having the following formulae:<br><br><br>
wherein EO represents an ethylene oxide group, PO represents a propylene oxide<br>
group, and x and y reflect the average molecular proportion of each alkylene oxide<br>
monomer in the overall block copolymer composition. In some embodiments, x is<br>
in the range of about 10 to about 130, y is in the range of about 15 to about 70, and x<br>
plus y is in the range of about 25 to about 200. It should be understood that each x<br>
and y in a molecule can be different. In some embodiments, the total<br>
polyoxyethylene component of the block copolymer can be in the range of at least<br>
about 20 mol-% of the block copolymer and in some embodiments, in the range of at<br>
least about 30 mol-% of the block copolymer. In some embodiments, the material<br>
can have a molecular weight greater than about 400, and in some embodiments,<br>
greater than about 500. For example, in some embodiments, the material can have a<br>
molecular weight in the range of about 500 to about 7000 or more, or in the rang of<br>
about 950 to about 4000 or more, or in the range of about 1000 to about 3100 or<br>
more, or in the range of about 2100 to about 6700 or more.<br>
Although the exemplary polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene block<br>
copolymer structures provided above have 3-8 blocks, it should be appreciated that<br>
the nonionic block copolymer surfactants can include more or less than 3 or 8<br>
blocks. In addition, the nonionic block copolymer surfactants can include additional<br>
repeating units such as butylene oxide repeating units. Furthermore, the nonionic<br>
block copolymer surfactants that can be used according to the invention can be<br>
characterized hetero-polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene block copolymers. Some<br>
examples of suitable block copolymer surfactants include commercial products such<br>
as PLURONIC® and TETRONIC® surfactants, commercially available from BASF.<br>
For example, PLURONIC® 25-R4 is one example of a useful block copolymer<br>
surfactant commercially available from BASF, that is biodegradable and GRAS<br>
(generally recognized as safe).<br>
It is believed that one skilled in the art would understand that a nonionic<br>
surfactant with an unacceptably high cloud point temperature or an unacceptably<br>
high molecular weight would either produce unacceptable foaming levels or fail to<br>
provide adequate defoaming capacity in a rinse aid composition.<br>
The defoamer component can comprise a very broad range of weight percent<br>
of the entire composition, depending upon the desired properties. For example, for<br>
concentrated embodiments, the defoamer component can comprise in the range of 1<br>
to about 10 wt.-% of the total composition, in some embodiments in the range of<br>
about 5 to about 25 wt.-% of the total composition, in some embodiments in the<br>
range of about 20 to about 50 wt.-% of the total composition, and in some<br>
embodiments in the range of about 40 to about 90 wt.-% of the total composition.<br>
For some diluted or use solutions, the defoamer component can comprise in the<br>
range of 5 to about 60 ppm of the total use solution, in some embodiments in the<br>
range of about 50 to about 150 ppm of the total use solution, in some embodiments<br>
in the range of about 100 to about 250 ppm of the total use solution, and in some<br>
embodiments in the range of about 200 to about 500 ppm of the use solution.<br>
The amount of defoamer component present in the composition can also be<br>
dependent upon the amount of sheeting agent present in the composition. For<br>
example, the less sheeting agent present in the composition may provide for the use<br>
of less defoamer component. In some example embodiments, the ratio of weight-<br>
percent sheeting agent component to weight-percent defoamer component may be in<br>
the range of about 1:5 to about 5:1, or in the range of about 1:3 to about 3:1. Those<br>
of skill in the art will recognize that the ratio of sheeting agent component to<br>
defoamer component may be dependent on the properties of either and/or both<br>
actual components used, and these ratios may vary from the example ranges given to<br>
achieve the desired defoaming effect. Defoamer components are also described in<br>
U.S. Application Serial No. 10/703,042, assigned to Ecolab, herein incorporated by<br>
reference.<br>
Water<br>
The solid rinse aid composition includes water. Solidification of the solid<br>
rinse aid composition with sodium sulfate and sodium bisulfate accommodates<br>
higher water levels than conventional rinse aid solidification relying on PEG or urea.<br>
Water many be independently added to the solid rinse aid composition or may be<br>
provided in the solid rinse aid composition as a result of its presence in an aqueous<br>
material that is added to the solid rinse aid composition. Typically, sodium bisulfate<br>
is combined with water or other aqueous materials prior to completing addition of<br>
other materials. For example, materials added to the solid rinse aid composition<br>
include water or may be prepared in an aqueous premix available for reaction with<br>
the solidification agent component(s). Typically, water is introduced into the solid<br>
rinse aid composition to provide the detergent composition with a desired viscosity<br>
prior to solidification, and to provide a desired rate of solidification.<br>
In general, it is expected that water may be present as a processing aid and<br>
may be removed or become water of hydration. It is expected that water may be<br>
present in the solid composition. In the solid composition, it is expected that the<br>
water will be present in the solid rinse aid composition in the range of between 2<br>
wt.% and 15 wt.%. For example, water is present in embodiments of the solid rinse<br>
aid composition in the range of between 2 wt.% to about 12 wt.%, or further<br>
embodiments in the range of between 3 wt.% and about 10 wt.%, or yet further<br>
embodiments in the range of between 3 wt.% and 4 wt.%. It should be additionally<br>
appreciated that the water may be provided as deionized water or as softened water.<br>
The components used to form the solid composition can include water as<br>
hydrates or hydrated forms of the binding agent, hydrates or hydrated forms of any<br>
of the other ingredients, and/or added aqueous medium as an aid in processing. It is<br>
expected that the aqueous medium will help provide the components with a desired<br>
viscosity for processing. In addition, it is expected that the aqueous medium may<br>
help in the solidification process when is desired to form the concentrate as a solid.<br>
Additional Functional Materials<br>
As indicated above, hydrated sodium sulfate and hydrated sodium bisulfate<br>
can be used to form a solid rinse aid composition that may contain other functional<br>
materials, in addition to the sheeting agent component and the defoamer component,<br>
that provide the desired properties and functionality to the solid composition.<br>
Functional materials include a material that when dispersed or dissolved in a use<br>
solution, provides a beneficial property in a particular use. Examples of such a<br>
functional material include chelating/sequestering agents; bleaching agents or<br>
activators; sanitizers/anti-microbial agents; activators; builder or fillers; anti-<br>
redeposition agents; optical brighteners; dyes; odorants or perfumes; preservatives;<br>
stabilizers; processing aids; corrosion inhibitors; fillers; solidifiers; hardening agent;<br>
solubility modifiers; pH adjusting agents; humectants; hydrotropes; or abroad<br>
variety of other functional materials, depending upon the desired characteristics<br>
and/or functionality of the composition. In the context of some embodiments<br>
disclosed herein, the functional materials, or ingredients, are optionally included<br>
within the solidification matrix for their functional properties. Some more particular<br>
examples of functional materials are discussed in more detail below, but it should be<br>
understood by those of skill in the art and others that the particular materials<br>
discussed are given by way of example only, and that a broad variety of other<br>
functional materials may be used.<br>
Preservatives<br>
The solid rinse aid composition may also include effective amounts of<br>
preservatives. Often, overall acidity and/or acids in the solid rinse aid composition<br>
and the use solution serves a preservative and stabilizing function.<br>
Some embodiments of the inventive solid rinse aid composition also include<br>
a GRAS preservative system for acidification of the solid rinse aid including sodium<br>
bisulfate and organic acids. In at least some embodiments, the solid rinse aid has pH<br>
of 2.0 or less and the use solution of the solid rinse aid has a pH of at least pH 4.0.<br>
Typically, sodium bisulfate is included in the solid rinse aid composition as an acid<br>
source. In certain embodiments, an effective amount of sodium bisulfate and one or<br>
more other acids are included in the solid rinse aid composition as a preservative<br>
system. Suitable acids include for example, inorganic acids, such as HC1 and<br>
organic acids. In certain further embodiments, an effective amount of sodium<br>
bisulfate and one or more organic acids are included in the solid rinse aid<br>
composition as a preservative system. Suitable organic acids include sorbic acid,<br>
benzoic acid, ascorbic acid, erythorbic acid, citric acid, etc... Generally, effective<br>
amounts of sodium bisulfate with or without additional acids are included such that a<br>
use solution of the solid rinse aid composition has a pH that shall be less than pH<br>
4.0, often less pH 3.0, and may be even less than pH 2.0.<br>
In other embodiments, the solid rinse aid composition includes<br>
sanitizers/anti-microbial agents, in addition to or in alternative the preservative<br>
system described above. Suitable sanitizers/anti-microbial agents are described<br>
below.<br>
Chelating/Sequestering Agents<br>
The solid rinse aid composition may also include effective amounts of<br>
sodium sulfate and sodium bisulfate to function as chelating/sequestering agents,<br>
also referred to as builders. In addition, the rinse aid may optionally include one or<br>
more additional builders as a functional ingredient. In general, a chelating agent is<br>
a molecule capable of coordinating (i.e., binding) the metal ions commonly found in<br>
water sources to prevent the metal ions from interfering with the action of the other<br>
ingredients of a rinse aid or other cleaning composition. The chelating/sequestering<br>
agent may also function as a threshold agent when included in an effective amount.<br>
In some embodiments, a solid rinse aid can include in the range of up to about 70 wt.<br>
%, or in the range of about 1-60 wt. %, of a chelating/sequestering agent.<br>
Often, the solid rinse aid composition is also phosphate-free and/or amino-<br>
carboxylate-free. In embodiments of the solid rinse aid composition that are<br>
phosphate-free, the additional functional materials, including builders exclude<br>
phosphorous-containing compounds such as condensed phosphates and<br>
phosphonates.<br>
Suitable additional builders include polycarboxylates. Some examples of<br>
polymeric polycarboxylates suitable for use as sequestering agents include those<br>
having a pendant carboxylate (--CO2) groups and include, for example, polyacrylic<br>
acid, maleic/olefin copolymer, acrylic/maleic copolymer, polymethacrylic acid,<br>
acrylic acid-methacrylic acid copolymers, hydrolyzed polyacrylamide, hydrolyzed<br>
polymethacrylamide, hydrolyzed polyamide-methacrylamide copolymers,<br>
hydrolyzed polyacrylonitrile, hydrolyzed polymethacrylonitrile, hydrolyzed<br>
acrylonitrile-methacrylonitrile copolymers, and the like.<br>
In embodiments of the solid rinse aid composition which are not<br>
aminocarboxyate-free may include added chelating/sequestering agents which are<br>
aminocarboxylates. Some examples of aminocarboxylic acids include, N-<br>
hydroxyethyliminodiacetic acid, nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA),<br>
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), N-hydroxyethyl-ethylenediaminetriacetic<br>
acid (HEDTA) (in addition to the HEDTA used in the binder),<br>
diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA), and the like.<br>
In embodiments of the solid rinse aid composition which are not phosphate-<br>
free, added chelating/sequestering agents may include, for example a condensed<br>
phosphate, a phosphonate, and the like. Some examples of condensed phosphates<br>
include sodium and potassium orthophosphate, sodium and potassium<br>
pyrophosphate, sodium tripolyphosphate, sodium hexametaphosphate, and the like.<br>
A condensed phosphate may also assist, to a limited extent, in solidification of the<br>
composition by fixing the free water present in the composition as water of<br>
hydration.<br>
In embodiments of the solid rinse aid composition which are not phosphate-<br>
free, the composition may include a phosphonate such as 1-hydroxyethane-1,1-<br>
diphosphonic acid CH3C(OH)[PO(OH)2 ]2; aminotri(methylenephosphonic acid)<br>
N[CH2 PO(OH)2 ]3 ; aminotri(methylenephosphonate), sodium salt<br><br>
2-hydroxyethyliminobis(methylenephosphonic acid) HOCH2 CH2 N[CH2 PO(OH)2<br>
]2; diethylenetriaminepenta(methylenephosphonic acid) (HO)2 POCH2 N[CH2 CH2<br>
N[CH2 PO(OH)2]2 ]2; diethylenetriaminepenta(methylenephosphonate), sodium salt<br>
C9 H(28-x) N3 NaxO15P5 (x=7); hexamethylenediamine(tetramethylenephosphonate),<br>
potassium salt C10 H(28-x)N2KxO12P4 (x=6);<br>
bis(hexamethylene)triamine(pentamethylenephosphonic acid)<br>
(HO2)POCH2N[(CH2)6 N[CH2 PO(OH)2]2]2; and phosphorus acid H3PO3. In some<br>
embodiments, a phosphonate combination such as ATMP and DTPMP may be used.<br>
A neutralized or alkaline phosphonate, or a combination of the phosphonate with an<br>
alkali source prior to being added into the mixture such that there is little or no heat<br>
or gas generated by a neutralization reaction when the phosphonate is added can be<br>
used.<br>

Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Third Edition, volume 5, pages 339-366 and<br>
volume 23, pages 319-320, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference<br>
herein.<br>
Bleaching Agents<br>
The rinse aid can optionally include bleaching agent. Bleaching agent can be<br>
used for lightening or whitening a substrate, and can include bleaching compounds<br>
capable of liberating an active halogen species, such as Cl2, Br2, -OCl- and/or -OBr-,<br>
or the like, under conditions typically encountered during the cleansing process.<br>
Suitable bleaching agents for use can include, for example, chlorine-containing<br>
compounds such as a chlorine, a hypochlorite, chloramines, of the like. Some<br>
examples of halogen-releasing compounds include the alkali metal<br>
dichloroisocyanurates, chlorinated trisodium phosphate, the alkali metal<br>
hypochlorites, monochloramine and dichloroamine, and the like. Encapsulated<br>
chlorine sources may also be used to enhance the stability of the chlorine source in<br>
the composition (see, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,618,914 and 4,830,773, the<br>
disclosures of which are incorporated by reference herein). A bleaching agent may<br>
also include an agent containing or acting as a source of active oxygen. The active<br>
oxygen compound acts to provide a source of active oxygen, for example, may<br>
release active oxygen in aqueous solutions. An active oxygen compound can be<br>
inorganic or organic, or can be a mixture thereof. Some examples of active oxygen<br>
compound include peroxygen compounds, or peroxygen compound adducts. Some<br>
examples of active oxygen compounds or sources include hydrogen peroxide,<br>
perborates, sodium carbonate peroxyhydrate, phosphate peroxyhydrates, potassium<br>
permonosulfate, and sodium perborate mono and tetrahydrate, with and without<br>
activators such as tetraacetylethylene diamine, and the like. A rinse aid composition<br>
may include a minor but effective amount of a bleaching agent, for example, in<br>
some embodiments, in the range of up to about 10 wt. %, and in some embodiments,<br>
in the range of about 0.1 to about 6 wt. %.<br>
Sanitizers/Anti-Microbial Agents<br>
The rinse aid can optionally include a sanitizing agent. Sanitizing agents<br>
also known as antimicrobial agents are chemical compositions that can be used in a<br>
solid functional material to prevent microbial contamination and deterioration of<br>
material systems, surfaces, etc. Generally, these materials fall in specific classes<br>
including phenolics, halogen compounds, quaternary ammonium compounds, metal<br>
derivatives, amines, alkanol amines, nitro derivatives, analides, organosulfur and<br>
sulfur-nitrogen compounds and miscellaneous compounds.<br>
It should also be understood that active oxygen compounds, such as those<br>
discussed above in the bleaching agents section, may also act as antimicrobial<br>
agents, and can even provide sanitizing activity. In fact, in some embodiments, the<br>
ability of the active oxygen compound to act as an antimicrobial agent reduces the<br>
need for additional antimicrobial agents within the composition. For example,<br>
percarbonate compositions have been demonstrated to provide excellent<br>
antimicrobial action. Nonetheless, some embodiments incorporate additional<br>
antimicrobial agents.<br>
The given antimicrobial agent, depending on chemical composition and<br>
concentration, may simply limit further proliferation of numbers of the microbe or<br>
may destroy all or a portion of the microbial population. The terms "microbes" and<br>
"microorganisms" typically refer primarily to bacteria, virus, yeast, spores, and<br>
fungus microorganisms. In use, the antimicrobial agents are typically formed into a<br>
solid functional material that when diluted and dispensed, optionally, for example,<br>
using an aqueous stream forms an aqueous disinfectant or sanitizer composition that<br>
can be contacted with a variety of surfaces resulting in prevention of growth or the<br>
killing of a portion of the microbial population. A three log reduction of the<br>
microbial population results in a sanitizer composition. The antimicrobial agent can<br>
be encapsulated, for example, to improve its stability.<br>
Some examples of common antimicrobial agents include phenolic<br>
antimicrobials such as pentachlorophenol, orthophenylphenol, a chloro-p-<br>
benzylphenol, p-chloro-m-xylenol. Halogen containing antibacterial agents include<br>
sodium trichloroisocyanurate, sodium dichloro isocyanate (anhydrous or dihydrate),<br>
iodine-poly(vinylpyrolidinone) complexes, bromine compounds such as 2-bromo-2-<br>
nitropropane-1,3-diol, and quaternary antimicrobial agents such as benzalkonium<br>
chloride, didecyldimethyl ammonium chloride, choline diiodochloride, tetramethyl<br>
phosphonium tribromide. Other antimicrobial compositions such as hexahydro-<br>
1,3,5-tris(2-hydroxyethyl)-s- -triazine, dithiocarbamates such as sodium<br>
dimethyldithiocarbamate, and a variety of other materials are known in the art for<br>
their antimicrobial properties. Example antimicrobial agents include a blend of<br>
methylchloroisothiazolinone and methylisothiazolinone, available from Rohm and<br>
Haas under the tradename KATHON.<br>
In embodiments of the solid rinse aid composition which are phosphate-free,<br>
and/or aminocarboxylate-free, and also include an anti-microbial agent, the anti-<br>
microbial is selected to meet those requirements. Embodiments of the solid rinse aid<br>
composition which include only GRAS ingredients, may exclude or omit anti-<br>
microbial agents described in this section.<br>
In some embodiments, the rinse aid composition comprises, an antimicrobial<br>
component, such as blends of methylchloroisothiazolinone and<br>
methylisothiazolinone, in the range of up to about 10 % by wt. of the composition,<br>
in some embodiments in the range of up to about 5 wt. %, or in some embodiments,<br>
in the range of about 0.01 to about 3 wt. %, or in the range of 0.05 to 1% by wt of<br>
the composition.<br>
Activators<br>
In some embodiments, the antimicrobial activity or bleaching activity of the<br>
rinse aid can be enhanced by the addition of a material which, when the composition<br>
is placed in use, reacts with the active oxygen to form an activated component. For<br>
example, in some embodiments, a peracid or a peracid salt is formed. For example,<br>
in some embodiments, tetraacerylethylene diamine can be included within the<br>
composition to react with the active oxygen and form a peracid or a peracid salt that<br>
acts as an antimicrobial agent. Other examples of active oxygen activators include<br>
transition metals and their compounds, compounds that contain a carboxylic, nitrile,<br>
or ester moiety, or other such compounds known in the art. In an embodiment, the<br>
activator includes tetraacetylethylene diamine; transition metal; compound that<br>
includes carboxylic, nitrile, amine, or ester moiety; or mixtures thereof.<br>
In some embodiments, an activator component can include in the range of up<br>
to about 75 % by wt. of the composition, in some embodiments, in the range of<br>
about 0.01 to about 20% by wt, or in some embodiments, in the range of about 0.05<br>
to 10% by wt of the composition. In some embodiments, an activator for an active<br>
oxygen compound combines with the active oxygen to form an antimicrobial agent.<br>
In some embodiments, the rinse aid composition includes a solid, such as a<br>
solid flake, pellet, or block, and an activator material for the active oxygen is<br>
coupled to the solid. The activator can be coupled to the solid by any of a variety of<br>
methods for coupling one solid cleaning composition to another. For example, the<br>
activator can be in the form of a solid that is bound, affixed, glued or otherwise<br>
adhered to the solid of the rinse aid composition. Alternatively, the solid activator<br>
can be formed around and encasing the solid rinse aid composition. By way of<br>
further example, the solid activator can be coupled to the solid rinse aid composition<br>
by the container or package for the composition, such as by a plastic or shrink wrap<br>
or film.<br>
Fillers<br>
The rinse aid can optionally include a minor but effective amount of one or<br>
more of a filler which does not necessarily perform as a rinse and/or cleaning agent<br>
per se, but may cooperate with a rinse agent to enhance the overall capacity of the<br>
composition. Some examples of suitable fillers may include sodium chloride,<br>
starch, sugars, C1 -C10 alkylene glycols such as propylene glycol, and the like. In<br>
some embodiments, a filler can be included in an amount in the range of up to about<br>
20 wt. %, and in some embodiments, in the range of about 1-15 wt. %. Sodium<br>
sulfate is conventionally used as inert filler. However, surprisingly, sodium sulfate<br>
was found to function in solidification in combination with urea.<br>
Anti-Redeposition Agents<br>
The rinse aid composition can optionally include an anti-redeposition agent<br>
capable of facilitating sustained suspension of soils in a rinse solution and<br>
preventing removed soils from being redeposited onto the substrate being rinsed.<br>
Some examples of suitable anti-redeposition agents can include fatty acid amides,<br>
fluorocarbon surfactants, complex phosphate esters, styrene maleic anhydride<br>
copolymers, and cellulosic derivatives such as hydroxyethyl cellulose,<br>
hydroxypropyl cellulose, and the like. A rinse aid composition may include up to<br>
about 10 wt. %, and in some embodiments, in the range of about 1 to about 5 wt. %,<br>
of an anti-redeposition agent.<br>
Dyes/Odorants<br>
Various dyes, odorants including perfumes, and other aesthetic enhancing<br>
agents may also be included in the rinse aid. Dyes may be included to alter the<br>
appearance of the composition, as for example, FD&amp;C Blue 1 (Sigma Chemical),<br>
FD&amp;C Yellow 5 (Sigma Chemical), Direct Blue 86 (Miles), Fastusol Blue (Mobay<br>
Chemical Corp.), Acid Orange 7 (American Cyanamid), Basic Violet 10 (Sandoz),<br>
Acid Yellow 23 (GAF), Acid Yellow 17 (Sigma Chemical), Sap Green (Keyston<br>
Analine and Chemical), Metanil Yellow (Keystone Analine and Chemical), Acid<br>
Blue 9 (Hilton Davis), Sandolan Blue/Acid Blue 182 (Sandoz), Hisol Fast Red<br>
(Capitol Color and Chemical), Fluorescein (Capitol Color and Chemical), Acid<br>
Green 25 (Ciba-Geigy), and the like.<br>
Fragrances or perfumes that may be included in the compositions include, for<br>
example, terpenoids such as citronellol, aldehydes such as amyl cinnamaldehyde, a<br>
jasmine such as C1S-jasmine or jasmal, vanillin, and the like.<br>
Additional Hardening/Solidification Agents/Solubility Modifiers<br>
Typically, sodium sulfate and urea are used for solidification of the solid<br>
rinse aid composition. However, in some embodiments, one or more additional<br>
hardening agents may be included in the solid rinse aid composition, in addition to<br>
the sodium sulfate and urea, if desired. Examples of hardening agents include an<br>
amide such stearic monoethanolamide or lauric diethanolamide, or an alkylamide,<br>
and the like; a solid polyethylene glycol, or a solid EO/PO block copolymer, and the<br>
like; starches that have been made water-soluble through an acid or alkaline<br>
treatment process; various inorganics that impart solidifying properties to a heated<br>
composition upon cooling, and the like. Such compounds may also vary the<br>
solubility of the composition in an aqueous medium during use such that the rinse<br>
aid and/or other active ingredients may be dispensed from the solid composition<br>
over an extended period of time. The composition may include a secondary<br>
hardening agent in an amount in the range of up to about 30 wt%. In some<br>
embodiments, secondary hardening agents are may be present in an amount in the<br>
range of 5-25 wt%, often in the range of 10 to 25 wt% and sometimes in the range of<br>
about 5 to about 15 wt-%.<br>
Additional Sheeting Aids<br>
The composition can optionally include one or more additional rinse aid<br>
components, for example, an additional wetting or sheeting agent components in<br>
addition to the alcohol ethoxylate component discussed above. For example, water<br>
soluble or dispersible low foaming organic material capable of aiding in reducing<br>
the surface tension of the rinse water to promote sheeting action and/or to aid in<br>
reducing or preventing spotting or streaking caused by beaded water after rinsing is<br>
complete may also be included. Such sheeting agents are typically organic<br>
surfactant like materials having a characteristic cloud point. Surfactants useful in<br>
these applications are aqueous soluble surfactants having a cloud point greater than<br>
the available hot service water, and the cloud point can vary, depending on the use<br>
locus hot water temperature and the temperature and type of rinse cycle.<br>
Some examples of additional sheeting agents can typically comprise a<br>
polyether compound prepared from ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, or a mixture in<br>
a homopolymer or block or hetero-copolymer structure. Such polyether compounds<br>
are known as polyalkylene oxide polymers, polyoxyalkylene polymers or<br>
polyalkylene glycol polymers. Such sheeting agents require a region of relative<br>
hydrophobicity and a region of relative hydrophilicity to provide surfactant<br>
properties to the molecule. Such sheeting agents can have a molecular weight in the<br>
range of about 500 to 15,000. Certain types of (PO)(EO) polymeric rinse aids have<br>
been found to be useful containing at least one block of poly(PO) and at least one<br>
block of poly(EO) in the polymer molecule. Additional blocks of poly(EO), poly<br>
(PO) or random polymerized regions can be formed in the molecule. Particularly<br>
useful polyoxypropylene polyoxyethylene block copolymers are those comprising a<br>
center block of polyoxypropylene units and blocks of polyoxyethylene units to each<br>
side of the center block. Such polymers have the formula shown below:<br><br>
wherein m is an integer of 20 to 60, and each end is independently an integer of 10<br>
to 130. Another useful block copolymer are block copolymers having a center block<br>
of polyoxyethylene units and blocks of polyoxypropylene to each side of the center<br>
block. Such copolymers have the formula:<br><br>
wherein m is an integer of 15 to 175, and each end are independently integers of<br>
about 10 to 30. For solid compositions, a hydrotrope may be used to aid in<br>
maintaining the solubility of sheeting or wetting agents. Hydrotropes can be used to<br>
modify the aqueous solution creating increased solubility for the organic material. In<br>
some embodiments, hydrotropes are low molecular weight aromatic sulfonate<br>
materials such as xylene sulfonates and dialkyldiphenyl oxide sulfonate materials.<br>
Functional Polydimethylsiloxones<br>
The composition can also optionally include one or more functional<br>
polydimethylsiloxones. For example, in some embodiments, a polyalkylene oxide-<br>
modified polydimethylsiloxane, nonionic surfactant or a polybetaine-modified<br>
polysiloxane amphoteric surfactant can be employed as an additive. Both, in some<br>
embodiments, are linear polysiloxane copolymers to which polyethers or<br>
polybetaines have been grafted through a hydrosilation reaction. Some examples of<br>
specific siloxane surfactants are known as SILWET® surfactants available from<br>
Union Carbide or ABIL® polyether or polybetaine polysiloxane copolymers<br>
available from Goldschmidt Chemical Corp., and described in U.S. Pat. No.<br>
4,654,161 which patent is incorporated herein by reference. In some embodiments,<br>
the particular siloxanes used can be described as having, e.g., low surface tension,<br>
high wetting ability and excellent lubricity. For example, these surfactants are said<br>
to be among the few capable of wetting polytetrafluoroethylene surfaces. The<br>
siloxane surfactant employed as an additive can be used alone or in combination<br>
with a fluoroehemical surfactant. In some embodiments, the fluorochemical<br>
surfactant employed as an additive optionally in combination with a silane, can be,<br>
for example, a nonionic fluorohydrocarbon, for example, fluorinated alkyl<br>
polyoxyethyllene ethanols, fluorinated alkyl alkoxylate and fluorinated alkyl esters.<br>
Further description of such functional polydimethylsiloxones and/or<br>
fiuorochemical surfactants are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,880,088; 5,880,089; and<br>
5,603,776, all of which patents are incorporated herein by reference. We have found,<br>
for example, that the use of certain polysiloxane copolymers in a mixture with<br>
hydrocarbon surfactants provide excellent rinse aids on plasticware. We have also<br>
found that the combination of certain silicone polysiloxane copolymers and<br>
fluorocarbon surfactants with conventional hydrocarbon surfactants also provide<br>
excellent rinse aids on plasticware. This combination has been found to be better<br>
than the individual components except with certain polyalkylene oxide-modified<br>
polydimethylsiloxanes and polybetaine polysiloxane copolymers, where the<br>
effectiveness is about equivalent. Therefore, some embodiments encompass the<br>
polysiloxane copolymers alone and the combination with the fluorocarbon surfactant<br>
can involve polyether polysiloxanes, the nonionic siloxane surfactants. The<br>
amphoteric siloxane surfactants, the polybetaine polysiloxane copolymers may be<br>
employed alone as the additive in the rinse aids to provide the same results.<br>
In some embodiments, the composition may include functional<br>
polydimethylsiloxones in an amount in the range of up to about 10 wt-%. For<br>
example, some embodiments may include in the range of about 0.1 to 10 wt-% of a<br>
polyalkylene oxide-modified polydimethylsiloxane or a polybetaine-modified<br>
polysiloxane, optionally in combination with about 0.1 to 10 wt-% of a fluorinated<br>
hydrocarbon nonionic surfactant.<br>
Humectant<br>
The composition can also optionally include one or more humectants. A<br>
humectant is a substance having an affinity for water. The humectant can be<br>
provided in an amount sufficient to aid in reducing the visibility of a film on the<br>
substrate surface. The visibility of a film on substrate surface is a particular concern<br>
when the rinse water contains in excess of 200 ppm total dissolved solids.<br>
Accordingly, in some embodiments, the humectant is provided in an amount<br>
sufficient to reduce the visibility of a film on a substrate surface when the rinse<br>
water contains in excess of 200 ppm total dissolved solids compared to a rinse agent<br>
composition not containing the humectant. The terms "water solids filming" or<br>
"filming" refer to the presence of a visible, continuous layer of matter on a substrate<br>
surface that gives the appearance that the substrate surface is not clean.<br>
Some example humectants that can be used include those materials that<br>
contain greater than 5 wt. % water (based on dry humectant) equilibrated at 50%<br>
relative humidity and room temperature. Exemplary humectants that can be used<br>
include glycerin, propylene glycol, sorbitol, alkyl polyglycosides, polybetaine<br>
polysiloxanes, and mixtures thereof. In some embodiments, the rinse agent<br>
composition can include humectant in an amount in the range of up to about 75%<br>
based on the total composition, and in some embodiments, in the range of about 5<br>
wt. % to about 75 wt. % based on the weight of the composition. In some<br>
embodiments, where humectant is present, the weight ratio of the humectant to the<br>
sheeting agent can be in the range of about 1:3 or greater, and in some embodiments,<br>
in the range of about 5:1 and about 1:3.<br>
Other Ingredients<br>
A wide variety of other ingredients useful in providing the particular<br>
composition being formulated to include desired properties or functionality may also<br>
be included. For example, the rinse aid may include other active ingredients, such as<br>
pH modifiers, buffering agents, cleaning enzyme, carriers, processing aids, or others,<br>
and the like.<br>
Additionally, the rinse aid can be formulated such that during use in aqueous<br>
operations, for example in aqueous cleaning operations, the rinse water will have a<br>
desired pH. For example, compositions designed for use in rinsing may be<br>
formulated such that during use in aqueous rinsing operation the rinse water will<br>
have a pH in the range of about 3 to about 5, or in the range of about 5 to about 9.<br>
Liquid product formulations in some embodiments have a (10% dilution) pH in the<br>
range of about 2 to about 4. Techniques for controlling pH at recommended usage<br>
levels include the use of buffers, alkali, acids, etc., and are well known to those<br>
skilled in the art.<br>
Processing and/or Manufacturing of the Composition<br>
The invention also relates to a method of processing and/or making the solid<br>
rinse aid composition. The solid rinse aid composition is generally provided as a<br>
solid concentrate, e.g., block. In general, it is expected that the solid rinse aid<br>
composition will be diluted with water to provide the use solution that is then<br>
supplied to the surface of a substrate, for example, during a rinse cycle. The use<br>
solution preferably contains an effective amount of active material to provide<br>
reduced water solids filming in high solids containing water.<br>
The solid rinse aid composition can be processed and formulated using<br>
conventional equipment and techniques. The desired amount of the sheeting agent<br>
component and the defoamer component is provided, along with sodium sulfate,<br>
sodium bisulfate, and any other optional ingredients, such as one or more additional<br>
solidification agents. The components are vigorously admixed and heated, typically<br>
in the range of 100 to 140 °F. The vigorous admixing and heating may be<br>
performed in a TEKMAR mixer or an extruder system or other similar equipment.<br>
The complete mixture is subsequently extruded into the desired form or cast into a<br>
mold, cooled or chilled. Molded forms may be removed from the molds or remain<br>
in the container (i.e. mold)<br>
It should be understood that compositions and methods embodying the<br>
invention are suitable for preparing a variety of solid compositions, as for example, a<br>
cast, extruded, molded or formed solid pellet, block, tablet, and the like. In some<br>
embodiments, the solid composition can be formed to have a weight of 50 grams or<br>
less, while in other embodiments, the solid composition can be formed to have a<br>
weight of 50 grams or greater, 500 grams or greater, or 1 kilogram or greater. For<br>
the purpose of this application the term "solid block" includes cast, formed, or<br>
extruded materials having a weight of 50 grams or greater. The solid compositions<br>
provide for a stabilized source of functional materials. In some embodiments, the<br>
solid composition may be dissolved, for example, in an aqueous or other medium, to<br>
create a concentrated and/or use solution. The solution may be directed to a storage<br>
reservoir for later use and/or dilution, or may be applied directly to a point of use.<br>
The various liquid materials included in the rinse aid composition are<br>
adapted to a solid form by incorporating into the composition sodium sulfate and<br>
urea, optionally accompanied by one or more organic and inorganic solidifying<br>
materials. Other examples of casting agents include polyethylene glycol, and<br>
nonionic polyethylene or polypropylene oxide polymer. In some embodiments,<br>
polyethylene glycols (PEG) are used in melt type solidification processing by<br>
uniformly blending the sheeting agent and other components with PEG at a<br>
temperature above the melting point of the PEG and cooling the uniform mixture.<br>
In some embodiments, in the formation of a solid composition, a mixing<br>
system may be used to provide for continuous mixing of the ingredients at high<br>
enough shear to form a substantially homogeneous solid or semi-solid mixture in<br>
which the ingredients are distributed throughout its mass. In some embodiments, the<br>
mixing system includes means for mixing the ingredients to provide shear effective<br>
for maintaining the mixture at a flowable consistency, with a viscosity during<br>
processing in the range of about 1,000-1,000,000 cP, or in the range of about<br>
50,000-200,000 cP. In some example embodiments, the mixing system can be a<br>
continuous flow mixer or in some embodiments, an extruder, such as a single or<br>
twin screw extruder apparatus. A suitable amount of heat may be applied from an<br>
external source to facilitate processing of the mixture.<br>
The mixture is typically processed at a temperature to maintain the physical<br>
and chemical stability of the ingredients. In some embodiments, the mixture is<br>
processed at temperatures in the range of about 100 to 140 °F. In certain other<br>
embodiments, the mixture is processed at temperatures in the range of 110-125 ° F.<br>
Although limited external heat may be applied to the mixture, the temperature<br>
achieved by the mixture may become elevated during processing due to friction,<br>
variances in ambient conditions, and/or by an exothermic reaction between<br>
ingredients. Optionally, the temperature of the mixture may be increased, for<br>
example, at the inlets or outlets of the mixing system.<br>
An ingredient may be in the form of a liquid or a solid such as a dry<br>
particulate, and may be added to the mixture separately or as part of a premix with<br>
another ingredient, as for example, the sheeting agent, the defoamer, an aqueous<br>
medium, and additional ingredients such as a hardening agent, and the like. One or<br>
more premixes may be added to the mixture.<br>
The ingredients are mixed to form a substantially homogeneous consistency<br>
wherein the ingredients are distributed substantially evenly throughout the mass.<br>
The mixture can be discharged from the mixing system through a die or other<br>
shaping means. The profiled extrudate then can be divided into useful sizes with a<br>
controlled mass. Optionally, heating and cooling devices may be mounted adjacent<br>
to mixing apparatus to apply or remove heat in order to obtain a desired temperature<br>
profile in the mixer. For example, an external source of heat may be applied to one<br>
or more barrel sections of the mixer, such as the ingredient inlet section, the final<br>
outlet section, and the like, to increase fluidity of the mixture during processing. In<br>
some embodiments, the temperature of the mixture during processing, including at<br>
the discharge port, is maintained in the range of about 100 to 140 °F.<br>
The composition hardens due to the chemical or physical reaction of the<br>
requisite ingredients forming the solid. The solidification process may last from a<br>
few minutes to about six hours, or more, depending, for example, on the size of the<br>
cast or extruded composition, the ingredients of the composition, the temperature of<br>
the composition, and other like factors. In some embodiments, the cast or extruded<br>
composition "sets up" or begins to hardens to a solid form within about 1 minute to<br>
about 3 hours, or in the range of about 1 minute to about 2 hours, or in some<br>
embodiments, within about 1 minute to about 20 minutes.<br>
In some embodiments, the extruded solid can be packaged, for example in a<br>
container or in film. The temperature of the mixture when discharged from the<br>
mixing system can be sufficiently low to enable the mixture to be cast or extruded<br>
directly into a packaging system without first cooling the mixture. The time<br>
between extrusion discharge and packaging may be adjusted to allow the hardening<br>
of the composition for better handling during further processing and packaging. In<br>
some embodiments, the mixture at the point of discharge is in the range of about 100<br>
to 140 °F. In certain other embodiments, the mixture is processed at temperatures in<br>
the range of 110-125 ° F. The composition is then allowed to harden to a solid form<br>
that may range from a low density, sponge-like, malleable, caulky consistency to a<br>
high density, fused solid, concrete-like solid.<br>
An example cast solid rinse aid of the present invention may be prepared as<br>
follows: solvate the sodium bisulfate in aqueous solution, add sheeting agent(s),<br>
defoamer(s), and heat while admixing to maintain as a liquid, e.g., 100-140° F. Add<br>
urea and TEKMAR the mixture (e.g., vigorously mix). Add sodium sulfate,<br>
continue mixing, cast into a form. Additional ingredients, such as acid preservatives<br>
and dyes may be added at any stage prior to final mixing with sodium sulfate. Chill<br>
the form and pop-out the solid rinse aid composition.<br>
In an alternative example, a liquid premix is prepared by heated admixing of<br>
water, sodium bisulfate, sheeting agent(s), and surfactant(s) and separate preparation<br>
of a powder premix of acids, sodium sulfate, and urea. The powder premix is<br>
admixed into the heated liquid premix, for example using an extruder. The final<br>
product is extruded and cooled.<br>
Packaging System<br>
The solid rinse aid composition can be, but is not necessarily, incorporated<br>
into a packaging system or receptacle. The packaging receptacle or container may<br>
be rigid or flexible, and include any material suitable for containing the<br>
compositions produced, as for example glass, metal, plastic film or sheet, cardboard,<br>
cardboard composites, paper, or the like. Rinse aid compositions may be allowed to<br>
solidify in the packaging or may be packaged after formation of the solids in<br>
commonly available packaging and sent to distribution center before shipment to the<br>
consumer.<br>
For solids, advantageously, in at least some embodiments, since the rinse is<br>
processed at or near ambient temperatures, the temperature of the processed mixture<br>
is low enough so that the mixture may be cast or extruded directly into the container<br>
or other packaging system without structurally damaging the material. As a result, a<br>
wider variety of materials may be used to manufacture the container than those used<br>
for compositions that processed and dispensed under molten conditions. In some<br>
embodiments, the packaging used to contain the rinse aid is manufactured from a<br>
flexible, easy opening film material.<br>
Dispensing/Use of the Rinse Aid<br>
The rinse aid can be dispensed as a concentrate or as a use solution. In<br>
addition, the rinse aid concentrate can be provided in a solid form or in a liquid<br>
form. In general, it is expected that the concentrate will be diluted with water to<br>
provide the use solution that is then supplied to the surface of a substrate. In some<br>
embodiments, the aqueous use solution may contain about 2,000 parts per million<br>
(ppm) or less active materials, or about 1,000 ppm or less active material, or in the<br>
range of about 10 ppm to about 500 ppm of active materials, or in the range of<br>
about 10 to about 300 ppm, or in the range of about 10 to 200 ppm.<br>
The use solution can be applied to the substrate during a rinse application,<br>
for example, during a rinse cycle, for example, in a warewashing machine, a car<br>
wash application, or the like. In some embodiments, formation of a use solution can<br>
occur from a rinse agent installed in a cleaning machine, for example onto a dish<br>
rack. The rinse agent can be diluted and dispensed from a dispenser mounted on or<br>
in the machine or from a separate dispenser that is mounted separately but<br>
cooperatively with the dish machine.<br>
For example, in some embodiments, liquid rinse agents can be dispensed by<br>
incorporating compatible packaging containing the liquid material into a dispenser<br>
adapted to diluting the liquid with water to a final use concentration. Some<br>
examples of dispensers for the liquid rinse agent of the invention are<br>
DRYMASTER-P sold by Ecolab Inc., St. Paul, Minn.<br>
In other example embodiments, solid products, such as cast or extruded solid<br>
compositions, may be conveniently dispensed by inserting a solid material in a<br>
container or with no enclosure into a spray-type dispenser such as the volume SOL-<br>
ET controlled ECOTEMP Rinse Injection Cylinder system manufactured by Ecolab<br>
Inc., St. Paul, Minn. Such a dispenser cooperates with a warewashing machine in<br>
the rinse cycle. When demanded by the machine, the dispenser directs a spray of<br>
water onto the cast solid block of rinse agent which effectively dissolves a portion of<br>
the block creating a concentrated aqueous rinse solution which is then fed directly<br>
into the rinse water forming the aqueous rinse. The aqueous rinse is then contacted<br>
with the dishes to affect a complete rinse. This dispenser and other similar<br>
dispensers are capable of controlling the effective concentration of the active portion<br>
in the aqueous rinse by measuring the volume of material dispensed, the actual<br>
concentration of the material in the rinse water (an electrolyte measured with an<br>
electrode) or by measuring the time of the spray on the cast block. In general, the<br>
concentration of active portion in the aqueous rinse is preferably the same as<br>
identified above for liquid rinse agents. Some other embodiments of spray-type<br>
dispenser are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,826,661, 4,690,305, 4,687,121, 4,426,362<br>
and in U.S. Pat. Nos. Re 32,763 and 32,818, the disclosures of which are<br>
incorporated by reference herein. An example of a particular product shape is<br>
shown in FIG. 9 of U.S. Patent Application No. 6,258,765, which is incorporated<br>
herein by reference.<br>
In some embodiments, the rinse aid may be formulated for a particular<br>
application. For example, in some embodiments, the rinse aid may be particularly<br>
formulated for use in warewashing machines. As discussed above, there are two<br>
general types of rinse cycles in commercial warewashing machines. A first type of<br>
rinse cycle can be referred to as a hot water sanitizing rinse cycle because of the use<br>
of generally hot rinse water (about 180° F). A second type of rinse cycle can be<br>
referred to as a chemical sanitizing rinse cycle and it uses generally lower<br>
temperature rinse water (about 120° F).<br>
In some embodiments, it is believed that the rinse aid composition of the<br>
invention can be used in a high solids containing water environment in order to<br>
reduce the appearance of a visible film caused by the level of dissolved solids<br>
provided in the water. In general, high solids containing water is considered to be<br>
water having a total dissolved solids (TDS) content in excess of 200 ppm. In certain<br>
localities, the service water contains total dissolved solids content in excess of 400<br>
ppm, and even in excess of 800 ppm. The applications where the presence of a<br>
visible film after washing a substrate is a particular problem includes the restaurant<br>
or warewashing industry, the car wash industry, and the general cleaning of hard<br>
surfaces. Exemplary articles in the warewashing industry that can be treated with a<br>
rinse aid according to the invention include dishware, cups, glasses, flatware, and<br>
cookware. For the purposes of this invention, the terms "dish" and "ware" are used<br>
in the broadest sense to refer to various types of articles used in the preparation,<br>
serving, consumption, and disposal of food stuffs including pots, pans, trays,<br>
pitchers, bowls, plates, saucers, cups, glasses, forks, knives, spoons, spatulas, and<br>
other glass, metal, ceramic, plastic composite articles commonly available in the<br>
institutional or household kitchen or dining room. In general, these types of articles<br>
can be referred to as food or beverage contacting articles because they have surfaces<br>
which are provided for contacting food and/or beverage. When used in these<br>
warewashing applications, the rinse aid should provide effective sheeting action and<br>
low foaming properties. In addition to having the desirable properties described<br>
above, it may also be useful for the rinse aid to be biodegradable, environmentally<br>
friendly, and generally nontoxic. A rinse aid of this type may be described as being<br>
"food grade".<br>
The above description provides a basis for understanding the broad meets<br>
and bounds of the invention. The following examples and test data provide an<br>
understanding of certain specific embodiments of the invention. The invention will<br>
be further described by reference to the following detailed examples. These<br>
examples are not meant to limit the scope of the invention. Variation within the<br>
concepts of the invention is apparent to those skilled in the art.<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1 -- Solid Rinse Aid Compositions<br>
Each of the formulations, A through F, according to the present<br>
invention includes the combination Sodium Sulfate and urea for solid formation<br>
with defoamer (Polyoxypropylene polyoxyethylene Block copolymer) and a<br>
sheeting agent (solid alcohol ethoxylates), as well as sufficient acid (sorbic, benzoic<br>
and sodium bisulfate) acting as effective preservative. Example formulas D and F<br>
are also GRAS and biodegradable. In contrast, the conventional solid rinse aid uses<br>
propylene glycol and urea at lower water content water for solidification.<br><br>
The alcohol ethoxylates used in the formulas above are solid (C10-C16) linear<br>
alcohol ethoxylates available under the tradename NOVEL II 1012GB-21, from<br>
Sasol. LDO-97 and DO-97 are tradenames of polyoxypropylene polyoxyethylene<br>
block copolymers available from Huntsman Chemical. PLURONIC 25R2 is a<br>
tradename of BASF Wyandotte and consists of a block copolymer of ethylene oxide<br>
and propylene oxide. The polydimethylsiloxones used in the formulas above are<br>
dimethicone propyl PG-Betaine, 30% available from Degussa under the tradename<br>
Abil B 9950.<br>
The preservative in the comparative example is a blend of<br>
methylchloroisothiazolinone and methylisothiazolinone available from Rohm and<br>
Haas under the tradename KATHON.<br>
The water, solid alcohol ethoxylates (NOVEL II 1012GB-21), PO/EO block<br>
copolymers (LDO-97, DO-97, PLURAFAC) and polydimethylsiloxones (ABIL) are<br>
combined, heated to 115-120°F to melt the solid alcohol ethoxylates, and mixed for<br>
20 minutes. The elevated temperature of the mixture is maintained throughout the<br>
mixing process. The dyes are added to the mixture, with mixing continuing for an<br>
additional 15 minutes. The sorbic acids, benzoic acids, urea and bisulfate are added<br>
to the mixture, which is maintained by 115-120°F, and mixture for a further 10<br>
minutes. The sulfate is added using a TEKMAR mixer/homogenizer available from<br>
Tekmar Co. Cincinnati, OH while bringing the temperature up to about 120°F to<br>
avoid premature solidification of the product. The product is vigorously mixed in a<br>
TEKMAR mixer/homogenizer for 30 minutes. The processed product is formed<br>
into solid blocks, for example by feeding into containers of appropriate size and<br>
allowed to cool.<br>
The conventional solid rinse aid presented for comparison includes linear<br>
alcohol C12-15, 12 mole ethoxylate available under the tradename NEODOL 25-12<br>
from Shell Chemical. The preservative is a chloromethylisothiazolin mixture<br>
available under the tradename KATHON CG-ICP.<br>
Example 2 -- Stable Form Formation Assessment.<br>
In this example, a series of tests were run to compare the foam<br>
profiles of several of the raw materials (i.e. sheeting agents and defoamers) by<br>
themselves, in certain combinations with each other, and in combination with<br>
selected solid, rinse aids of the present invention as well as a conventional solid rinse<br>
aid. The formulations are provided in Example 1. The foam level and foam stability<br>
was read after one minute of agitation and again after 5 minutes of agitation. This<br>
test was done at 140°F under 6 atmospheres of pressure in a Glewwe Foam Testing<br>
Machine, with 50 ppm of active agent added, at an Ecolab Inc. facility. Stable foam<br>
was defined as foam that remains for several minutes after agitation is stopped.<br>
Partially stable foam was defined as foam that breaks slowly within a minute.<br>
Unstable foam was defined by foam that breaks rapidly (i.e., breaks in less than 15<br>
seconds). The results of the tests are shown in Table 2.<br><br>
Example 3 - Sheeting Performance<br>
In this example, sheeting ability during warewashing of a solid rinse<br>
aid of the present invention and a conventional rinse aid are tested. The ingredients<br>
for Formulation C of the present invention and the conventional rinse aid are<br>
provided in Example 1. For the sheeting evaluation, a number of warewash<br>
materials were exposed to the rinse aid formulations during a series of 30 second<br>
cycles using 150°F -160°F water. The warewash materials used for the evaluation<br>
were a china dinner plate, a glass panel or slide, a 10 oz. glass tumbler, a melamine<br>
dinner plate, a stainless steel butter knife, and a stainless steel panel or slide. These<br>
warewash materials were meticulously cleaned prior to the test and then soiled with<br>
a solution containing a 0.2% hotpoint soil, which is a mixture of powder milk and<br>
margarine. The amount of each rinse aid formulation that was used during the wash<br>
cycles was quantified in Tables 2 and 3 as parts per million surfactant.<br>
Immediately after the warewash materials were exposed to the rinse aid<br>
formulations, the appearance of the water draining off of the individual warewash<br>
materials (sheeting) was examined and evaluated. Tables 5-13 show the results of<br>
these tests. In Tables 2-3, the sheeting evaluation is indicated by either a dotted line<br>
(---) signifying no sheeting, the number "one" (1) signifying pin point sheeting, or a<br>
plus sign (+) signifying complete sheeting. The test was complete when all of the<br>
warewash materials were completely sheeted.<br><br>
In this example, a solid rinse aid composition including the components in<br>
the weight percents listed in Table 1 was formed using an extrusion technique in lieu<br>
of TEKMAR mixing.<br>
The above specification, examples and data provide a description of the<br>
manufacture and use of the composition of the invention. Many solid rinse aid<br>
compositions of the invention can be made without departing from the spirit and<br>
scope of the invention, which resides in the claims hereinafter appended.<br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
1. A solid rinse aid composition comprising:<br>
sodium sulfate;<br>
urea;<br>
water;<br>
sheeting agent comprising one or more alcohol ethoxylates; and<br>
defoamer component comprising a polymer compound including one<br>
