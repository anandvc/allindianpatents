TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
MANUFACTURE OF COMPOSITES BY A FLEXIBLE INJECTION PROCESS<br>
USING A DOUBLE OR MULTIPLE CAVITY MOLD<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001]	The present invention generally relates to the manufacture of<br>
composite parts. More specifically, the present invention is concerned with the<br>
manufacture of a composite part by injection of a liquid phase throughout a<br>
porous solid phase.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	Composite materials are generally considered engineering<br>
materials made from two or more components. One component is often a fiber<br>
or porous solid phase, generally called the strengthened which gives the<br>
material its tensile strength, while another component is often a resin or liquid<br>
phase, generally called the matrix, which binds the strengthener together and<br>
renders the composite material generally either stiff and rigid or deformable as<br>
a whole.<br>
[0003]	Several processes used in the. manufacture of composite<br>
parts consist of impregnating the strengthener with the matrix, which may be a<br>
polymer, (a resin) or any material that is liquid at the injection temperature.<br>
Variants of this family of processes are now grouped, under the generic term<br>
LGM or Liquid Composite Molding. Although they are used principally for the<br>
manufacture of polymer matrix composite parts, LCM processes are also<br>
encountered in biomedical and electronics applications, for example when<br><br>
WO 2005/000566	PCT/CA2004/000959<br>
2<br>
injecting a polymer to insulate microelectronic circuits. A molten metal may be<br>
injected instead of a polymer resin in order to manufacture metal matrix<br>
composite parts.<br>
[0004]	Polymer matrix composite manufacturing processes may be.<br>
separated into several categories:<br>
[0005]	Contact molding process<br>
[0006]	This manual method generally uses a half-mold on which the<br>
dry strengthener is set in layers that are impregnated by hand.<br>
[0007]	Autoclave process<br>
[0008]	The composite part is generally manufactured by hand from<br>
pre-impregnated strengthened and then cured in an autoplave. This method is<br>
widely used in aeronautics, most notably in the military sector. However, its<br>
cost remains generally high.<br>
[0009]	RTM (Resin Transfer Molding) process<br>
[0010]	The matrix in its liquid state is generally injected throughout a<br>
strengthener confined in a rigid mold. Liquid injection in the RTM process may<br>
be carried out at ambient temperature or at a higher temperature by heating<br>
either the injected liquid, the mold or both.<br>
[0011 ]	VARTM (Vacuum Assisted Resin Transfer Molding) process<br>
[0012]	A vacuum is generated inside the mold in order to facilitate<br><br>
WO 2005/000566	PCT/CA2004/000959<br>
3<br>
and accelerate matrix injection.<br>
[0013]	CRTM (Compression Resin Transfer Molding) process<br>
[0014]	Also   called   injection-compression,   the   CRTM   process<br>
generally consists of opening slightly the gap between the mold halves during<br>
injection to accelerate the liquid flow, after which the part is consolidated and<br>
sized to specification by lowering the press on the molds or one of the mold<br>
halves on the other.<br>
[0015]	VARI (Vacuum Assisted Resin Infusion) processes<br>
[0016]	The strehgthener is generally arranged beneath a plastic film<br>
or elastic membrane, creating a compartment which may be placed under<br>
vacuum. The liquid then infuses into the strengthener by gravity.<br>
[0017]	RTM Light process<br>
[0018]	This variant combines the advantages of deforming one<br>
boundary of the moid, as in the VARI process, with an imposed injection<br>
pressure, as in the RTM process. The mold consists of one or two thin metal or<br>
composite shells, which may be deformed under the pressure of injection. A<br>
first vacuum usually ensures closure of the mold, while a second vacuum is<br>
generated inside the cavity to accelerate injection.<br>
[0019]	Other variants<br>
[0020]	Numerous other variants of the LCM processes exist, which<br>
may be associated with one or another of the previously described main<br><br>
WO 2005/000566	PCT/CA2004/000959<br>
4<br>
categories. For example, the VEC injection process uses reservoirs containing<br>
a non-compressible fluid to strengthen the walls of a mold that are not in<br>
contact with the part. Preferential flow channels may also be created by various<br>
means in an outer layer of the strengthener (SCRIMP process), in one of the<br>
mold walls or inside the cavity, in order to facilitate liquid infusion or injection.<br>
[0021]	The quality of parts manufactured by contact molding is<br>
generally lower on average than that of injected parts. Labor costs are<br>
considerable as well, since each layer of the strengthener must be precisely<br>
positioned in the cavity and the laminate impregnated by hand. During<br>
impregnation by the liquid, air bubbles are often entrapped . inside the<br>
composite part. This constitutes the principal problem with contact molding and<br>
explains notably the large variations observed in part weight. A second<br>
disadvantage stems from the difficulty of ensuring constant part thickness and<br>
uniform fiber content, two critical parameters that govern the quality and<br>
mechanical properties of the composite part. Finally, another problem arises<br>
from increasingly strict government regulations concerning toxic gases or<br>
vapors generated during open moid manufacturing.<br>
[0022]	LCM   processes   based  on  the   use   of  closed   molds<br>
significantly eliminate most gaseous emissions during manufacturing.<br>
Conventional liquid injection molding is done using two rigid half-molds: the<br>
base generally designates the bottom portion of the mold, which remains<br>
immobile and the punch designates the top portion, which is raised in order to<br>
open the mold and free the part at the end of the manufacturing cycle. Between<br>
these two half-molds lies a cavity in which the strengthener is arranged and into<br>
which the injection occurs.<br>
[0023]	The RTM process and its variants VARTM and CRTM are<br>
generally appropriate for the manufacture of structural composite parts, but<br><br>
WO 2005/000566	PCT/CA2004/000959<br>
5<br>
constant thickness remains difficult to achieve because of the non uniform<br>
shrinkage of the resirt during the cure. It is not always easy to eliminate porosity<br>
completely in injected parts, even by creating vacuum in the cavity before<br>
injection. Finally, the biggest difficulty is associated with the injection time,<br>
which is generally too long for strengtheners with high fiber content (i.e., more<br>
than 50%).<br>
[0024]	Overall,   average  surface  appearance,   low  geometrical<br>
precision of the parts and limits regarding fiber content and injection time all<br>
reduce the range of applications of RTM process and its derived processes<br>
such as heated RTM, VARTM and injection-compression (CRTM). One<br>
constraint peculiar to CRTM process should also be mentioned. In general, the<br>
punch closes along a vertical axis, which results in practically no compression<br>
of the strengthener in the vertical zones of the cavity, while maximal pressure is<br>
exerted in the horizontal zones. This problem, in addition to difficulties inherent<br>
to the complexity of the process and risks of air entrapment during the<br>
compression phase, significantly limit the applications of CRTM process. It<br>
should be noted that compression of one half-mold over the other may also be<br>
performed by zones, but this significantly complicates the manufacturing of the<br>
mold.<br>
[0025]	Recently, new vacuum impregnation processes (VARI) have<br>
been introduced, which present the advantage of not requiring a cover mold. In<br>
these so-called liquid aspiration infusion processes, the strengthener is stiil<br>
arranged in the mold cavities, but' is then covered with an impermeable<br>
membrane sealed to the outer edges of the mold. The air inside the cavity<br>
formed between the membrane and the mold may then be evacuated using a<br>
vacuum pump. Atmospheric pressure then compacts the strengthener, while<br>
the liquid flows from an external source into the strengthener-filled cavity under<br>
vacuum. In this type of VARI process, liquid infusion into the strengthener is<br><br>
WO 2005/000566	PCT/CA2004/000959<br>
6<br>
carried out under vacuum at low flow rate under the single effect of static<br>
pressure due to gravity. The inclusion of air bubbles is thus eliminated, solving<br>
one of the problems encountered in other injection variants. However, the effect<br>
of gravity generally introduces non uniformity into the impregnation of the<br>
strengthener for large parts. In spite of the apparent simplicity of VARi<br>
processes, problems persist because the flow of the viscous matrix, such as for<br>
example resin, is difficult through strengtheners of low permeability. The fiber<br>
contents and dimensional accuracy of parts infused by VARI process are<br>
generally lower than the levels that may be accommodated by RTM process.<br>
Since resistance to resin penetration increases with the distance to be crossed,<br>
portions of certain parts may remain dry while excesses of resin accumulate in<br>
other zones.<br>
[0026]	In  order to  resolve these  problems,  variants  of  these<br>
processes have been recently developed, which artificially increase local<br>
permeabilities in the strengthener and thus decrease filling time. These include<br>
resin-dispersing permeable felts on one surface of the strengthener, networks<br>
of tubes to distribute the liquid matrix flow throughout the cavity, preferential<br>
flow channels or grooves incorporated into the surface of the mold and so on.<br>
All of these methods pose particular problems. The use of felt leads to<br>
increased waste of material, which is incompatible with mass production.<br>
Networks of tubes and flow channels generate practical development<br>
difficulties, which can be overcome only at the expense of generally costly trial<br>
periods. Finally, infusion still remains excessively slow compared to injection.<br>
The pressure gradient driving liquid penetration is much greater in an injection<br>
process than the infusion gradient which cannot exceed ambient atmospheric<br>
pressure minus the residual pressure inside the cavity under vacuum.<br><br>

[0026.1]	As another example, Wassenberg in DE199,26,896 teaches<br>
about a moi impregnation apparatus including a two-part moid configured and<br>
sized as to be sealingly mounted to one another with a flexible membrane in<br>
between. One of the molds receives the strengthener and the other one is<br>
provided with a series of channel for receiving the membrane when vacuum is<br>
provided in the apparatus, generating thereby less restriction during<br>
impregnation of the strengthener. In this apparatus however, no controlling fluid<br>
is provided for controlling the impregnation of the matrix by the strengthener.<br>
[0026.2]	As a further example, Cauchois et, al. in FR2.828.130 teach<br>
about a moid impregnation apparatus and method. The apparatus includes a<br>
two-part mold configured and sized as to be sealingly mounted to one another<br>
with a membrane in between. One of the molds receives the strengthener and<br>
the other one is provided with an access to a chamber defined between the<br>
latter mold and the membrane, providing thereby means for compressing, with<br>
air in an autoclave, the membrane and consequently, the strengthener on the<br>
other side of the membrane. In this apparatus however, the compaction by air<br>
is provided after the impregnation of the matrix by the strengthener for<br>
evacuating the excess of matrix already impregnated in the strengthener.<br><br>

OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0027]	An object of the present invention is therefore to provide a<br>
mold and a method of using the mold which allows to rapidly and efficiently<br>
inject under pressure the liquid matrix required to manufacture the composite<br>
part, without having to wait for complete impregnation of the strengthener.<br>
[0028]	A further object of the present invention is therefore to<br>
provide a mold and a method of using the mold which allows controlling the<br>
progression of the matrix flow front through the strengthener to increase the<br>
composition, geometrical and mechanical quality of the composite part during<br>
the various manufacturing steps.<br>
[0029]	Another further object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
mold and a method of using the moid which allows producing one or more than<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0073]	Generally  stated,  the  present  invention   relates  to  the<br>
manufacture of a composite material by injecting in a mold assembly a<br>
generally liquid phase, called the matrix, throughout a strengthener that is in a<br>
generally solid phase with a method of-injection that favors an efficient<br>
impregnation of the matrix in the strengthener. The matrix is generally a resin,<br>
such as for example a thermoset or a thermoplastic polymer or a liquid metal,<br>
and the strengthener is a fibrous, granular or any other type of porous material.<br>
Examples of commonly used thermoset polymers include epoxy, polyester,<br>
vinylester or phenolic resins, and examples of commonly used liquid metals<br><br>
WO 2005/000566	PCT/CA2004/000959<br>
15<br>
include aluminum or magnesium. The process of injection of the matrix into the<br>
strengthener is often used for the manufacture of composite parts. For<br>
example, a polymer, a metallic or a ceramic matrix may be reinforced by glass,<br>
carbon, kevlar, metal, ceramic or other strengtheners. In the case of fibrous<br>
strengthened, cloths or mats made of glass fiber, carbon, kevlar, aramide,<br>
natural fibers are generally used. The range of applications for such composite<br>
parts manufactured by such a process covers, amongst others, the field of<br>
transport vehicles (marine, automotive, aeronautical) and may also be used in<br>
the sport, biomedical and electronics sectors.<br>
 [0074]	The illustrative embodiment of Figure 1  shows a mold<br>
assembly 30 used in the injection of a matrix into the strengthener for the<br>
manufacture of composite parts. The mold assembly 30 is generally rigid and<br>
includes a base mold 32, a cover mold 34 and a deformable member, show in<br>
the illustrative embodiment as a membrane 36.<br>
[0075]	The base mold 32 is illustrated in more details in Figures 2, 3<br>
and 4 and includes a strengthener chamber 38 which is defined by a contact<br>
wall 40 and by peripheral walls 42. When in use, the strengthener chamber 38<br>
is generally so configured as to receive a strengthener and to provide the<br>
space into which the matrix is injected to manufacture the composite part.<br>
[0076]	The base mold 32 and its strengthener chamber 38 are<br>
generally designed to the dimensions of the strengthener to be injected with the<br>
matrix. It is easily understandable to the skilled reader that in the Figures, the<br>
base mold 32 is presented with a configuration adapted to receive a flat<br>
rectangular strengthener plate, but can be configured to suit various shapes of<br>
strengthener or a combined strengthener with a foamed core.<br>
[0077]            The base mold 32 further includes an evacuation outlet 44<br><br>
WO 2005/000566	PCT/CA2004/000959<br>
16<br>
and an injection inlet 46. The evacuation outlet 44 extends from the<br>
strengthener chamber 38 to the external surface of the base mold 32, and is so<br>
configured as to be connected to a vacuum source (not shown) to generate<br>
suction or vacuum in the strengthener chamber 38. More than one evacuation<br>
outlet 44 may be included in the base mold 32 and each of them may be<br>
connected to more than one vacuum source (not shown).<br>
[0078]	The injection inlet 46 extends through the base mold 32 with<br>
a first end being so configured as to be mounted to a matrix source (not shown)<br>
and with a second end in communication with the strengthener chamber 38. In<br>
the illustrative embodiment, the second end includes a diffusion passage 50<br>
extending along any desired path in the strengthener chamber 38 to maximize<br>
the diffusion of the matrix therein. Of course, more than one injection inlets 46<br>
may be provided around the strengthener chamber 38 or at its periphery.<br>
[0079]	The shoulder 47 of the base mold 32 includes grooves 48<br>
which are represented, as an example, as having a generally triangular cross-<br>
section which helps to hold the membrane 36 and to sealingly mount the cover<br>
mold 34 to the base mold 32. Optionally, additional standard molding elements,<br>
such as for examples o-ring sealants, tubes, guides, or demolding devices (not<br>
shown) may be added to facilitate mold closure and mold opening.<br>
[0080]	Turning now to Figures 5 and 6, the cover mold 34 includes a<br>
compression chamber 52 which is defined by a compression wall 54 and by<br>
peripheral walls 56. When in use, the compression chamber 52 is so configured<br>
as to receive a fluid or pressure means and has a geometry which is generally<br>
determined by the configuration of the part to be molded, as will be further<br>
described hereinbelow.<br>
[0081]	The cover mold 34 further includes a fluid control aperture 58<br><br>
WO 2005/000566	PCT/CA2004/000959<br>
17<br>
and a vent 60. The fluid control aperture 58 extends from the external surface<br>
of the cover mold 34 to the compression chamber 52, and is so configured as<br>
to be connected to a pressurized fluid source (not shown) to provide pressure<br>
in the compression chamber 52. More than one fluid control aperture 58 may<br>
be included in the cover mold 34 and each of them may be connected to more<br>
than one pressurized fluid source (not shown).<br>
[0082]	In the embodiment shown in Figure 6, a single fluid control<br>
aperture 58 is extending in the cover mold 34 in a direction which is generally<br>
along the direction of the injection inlet 46 in the base mold 32.<br>
[0083]	The vent 60 also extends from the compression chamber 38<br>
 to the external surface of the cover mold 34, and is so configured as to expel<br>
the fluid contained in the compression chamber 52. Alternatively, the vent 60 is<br>
connected to a vacuum source (not shown) to selectively provide suction or a<br>
partial vacuum in the compression chamber 52, or includes valves (not shown)<br>
to regulate the flow of fluid in the compression chamber 52. More than one vent<br>
60 may be included in the cover mold 34.<br>
[0084]	The shoulder 61 of the cover mold 34 includes ridges 62<br>
which are so configured as to cooperate with the grooves 48 of the base mold<br>
32 and are represented, as an example, as having a generally triangular cross-<br>
section. The assembly of the ridges 62 and grooves 48 generally extends<br>
around the shoulders 47, 61, in the periphery of the molds 32, 34 to help hold<br>
or locate the membrane 36, to mount the base mold 32 and the cover mold 34<br>
together and fo seal the chambers 38,52.<br>
[0085]	In Figure 6, the mold assembly 30 contains the strengthener<br>
66 in the chamber 38 of the base mold 32. When mounted together, the cover<br>
mold 34 and the base mold 32 delimit a gap 64 which includes the two<br><br>
WO 2005/000566	PCT/CA2004/000959<br>
18<br>
chambers 38,52 separated by the membrane 36.<br>
[0086]	.   The gap 64 is shown in Figure 6 as having a total thickness<br>
or height h, including the compression chamber 52 having a thickness or height<br>
hi and the strengthener chamber 38 having a thickness or height hs. The height<br>
h is adjusted as a function of the thickness of the strengthener being injected<br>
with the matrix, in order to control the filling of the strengthener by the matrix,<br>
as will be further explained hereinbelow. Also the variations of the height h<br>
allow the manufacture of composite parts of variable thickness.<br>
[0087]	The membrane 36 is provided in a cavity or gap defined by<br>
the strengthener chamber 38 and the compression chamber 52. The<br>
membrane 36 is generally a thin impermeable layer such as a plastic film, an<br>
elastic membrane, or a generally deformable foam not necessarily having a<br>
uniform thickness, or any type of material impermeable to the matrix used.<br>
Alternatively, the membrane 36 may be permeable to gas only.<br>
[0088]	The membrane 36 is sufficiently flexible to be deformed<br>
under pressure induced in the chambers 38,52, such that the height hf and the<br>
height hs are variable. As will be described hereinafter, this has the effect of<br>
facilitating the impregnation of the matrix in the strengthener. The deformation<br>
of the membrane 36 is nevertheless limited by the thickness h of the gap 64<br>
which, as mentioned hereinabove, is not necessarily uniform.<br>
[0089]	The surface finish of the contact wall 40 depends on the<br>
desired surface appearance for the composite part to manufacture. Usually, the<br>
base mold 32 is made of metal, but it can also be made of any material<br>
normally used to manufacture injection molds, for example, an epoxy /<br>
aluminum foam or a multi-layer composite mold. The surface finish of the<br>
compression wall 54 does not generally need to be of the same quality as that<br><br>
WO 2005/000566	PCT/CA2004/000959<br>
19<br>
of the contact wall 40 of the base mold 32 since most of the times, the<br>
compression wall 54 is not directly touching the strengthener, but usually<br>
indirectly in communication with the strengthener via the membrane 36.<br>
[0090]	In operation, the mold assembly 30 is used to manufacture a<br>
composite part by injecting the matrix throughout the strengthener 66. For<br>
clarity purposes, the manufacturing process will now be described with<br>
reference to a composite plate formed with the following steps: laying of the<br>
strengthener; placement of the membrane; closure of the mold assembly;<br>
application of vacuum to the strengthener chamber, injection of the matrix;<br>
injection of the controlling fluid;' compaction of the composite part; solidification<br>
of the part; and ejection from the mold assembly.<br>
Laving of the strenqthener<br>
[0091]	As illustrated in Figure 7, the strengthener 66 is first<br>
positioned in the chamber 38 of the base mold 32. This strengthener 66 is<br>
generally the "skeleton" of the composite material, as opposed to the matrix<br>
provided by injection.to impregnate and fill the strengthener 66. Under<br>
atmospheric pressure Pa, the free thickness of the generally non-compacted<br>
strengthener 66 is denoted as n0.<br>
Placement of the membrane<br>
[0092]	As shown in Figure 8, the membrane 36 is positioned on the<br>
base mold 32 in order to cover the strengthener 66 and over the grooves 48.<br>
As stated hereinabove, the base mold 32 and the membrane 36 generally<br>
delimit the strengthener chamber 38 adapted to receive the strengthener 66.<br><br>
WO 2005/000566	PCT/CA2004/000959<br>
20<br>
Closure of the mold assembly<br>
[0093]	From Figure 9, the cover mold 34 is fitted to the base mold 32<br>
via the ridges 62 and grooves 48 assembly in order to seal the strengthener<br>
chamber 38 and the compression chamber 52 with the strengthener 66 located<br>
in the strengthener chamber 38.<br>
Application of vacuum to the strenathener chamber<br>
[0094]	Optionally,  pressure in the strengthener chamber 38 is<br>
changed to facilitate the manufacture of the composite material. As seen in<br>
Figure 10, the pressure in the strengthener chamber 38 is set at a vacuum<br>
pressure Pv, which is generally lower than atmospheric pressure Pa.To change<br>
the pressure in the chamber 38, a vacuum source such as for example a<br>
vacuum pump is generally used through a connection to the evacuation outlet<br>
44 in the base mold 32 (see arrow 45).<br>
[0095]	In   this   case,   the   resulting   pressure   applied   to   the<br>
strengthener 66, that is, the ambient atmospheric pressure Pa minus the<br>
vacuum pressure Pv, generally compresses the strengthener 66 to a thickness<br>
hi which is less than h0.<br>
Injection of the liquid<br>
[0096]	In Figure 11, a predetermined quantity of matrix 70 is injected<br>
in the chamber 38 via the injection inlet 46 (see arrow 71). At first, a portion of<br>
the matrix 70 generally impregnates a fraction of the strengthened total<br>
volume 72 near where it is injected, and moves in the strengthener 66 with a<br>
matrix flow front 76. The matrix flow front 76 gradually moves along a<br><br>
WO 2005/000566	PCT/CA2004/000959<br>
21<br>
propagation direction generally defined from the injection inlet 46 to the<br>
evacuation outlet 44.<br>
[0097]	After injection, a portion of the matrix 70 impregnates a<br>
fraction of the strengthened total volume 72 and another portion of the matrix<br>
called free matrix generates a deformation zone 74 by swelling the membrane<br>
36 which deforms and occupies a portion of the compression chamber 52. The<br>
free matrix is generally the injected matrix 70 which has permeated across the<br>
strengthener or when the matrix infiltrates on the sides of the strengthened<br>
generally between the strengthener 66 and the strengthener chamber 38.<br>
[0098]	Alternatively, the free matrix swells the membrane 36 to<br>
significantly fill the compression chamber 52. Also alternatively, the deformation<br>
zone 74 is generated by tine varying thickness of the strengthener 66 saturated<br>
by the matrix and which, as a result, deforms the membrane 36.<br>
[0099]	Due to the injection of the matrix 70, the thickness hi of the<br>
strengthener chamber 38 generally increases, up to the maximal value h<br>
corresponding to the height of the gap 64.<br>
[0100]	Once the predetermined quantity of matrix 70 has been<br>
injected Into the strengthener chamber 38, the matrix injection inlet 46 is<br>
closed, the fluid control aperture 58 is generally obstructed by the swollen<br>
portion of the membrane 36, while the vent 60 allows evacuation of the air<br>
contained in the compression chamber 52 (see arrow 61).<br>
[0101]	Injection of the controlling fluid<br>
[0102]	The controlling fluid may be either a gas or more generally an<br><br>
WO 2005/000566	PCT/CA2004/000959<br>
22<br>
incompressible liquid such as water, oil or any other liquid meeting specified<br>
requirements. As seen in Figure 12 the fluid 78 is injected in the compression<br>
chamber 52, through the control aperture 58 (see arrow 59), at a temperature<br>
7/and a pressure Pf.<br>
[0103]	The pressure applied by the controlling fluid 78 on the<br>
membrane 36 progressively reduces the deformation of the membrane 36,<br>
compacts the strengthener 66 and forces both the matrix which is already in the<br>
impregnated strengthener volume 72 and the free matrix in the deformation<br>
zone 74 along its longitudinal extension.<br>
[0104]	This step has the effect of bringing the penetration of the<br>
matrix toward the un-impregnated strengthener volume 80 and enables to<br>
control the progression of the matrix flow front 76 through the strengthener 66<br>
.  along the propagation direction.<br>
[0105]	By heating the controlling fluid 78 and/or the base mold 32,<br>
the temperature inside the strengthener chamber 38 is regulated. Usually,<br>
higher temperatures generally decrease the viscosity of the matrix 70 and<br>
facilitate its penetration into the strengthener 66. Increasing the controlling fluid<br>
temperature 7} also generally facilitates the progression of the matrix flow front<br>
76 through the strengthener 66.<br>
[0106]	Compaction of the composite part<br>
[0107]	As seen in Figure 13, when the compression chamber 52 is<br>
filled by the controlling fluid 78, pressure is increased up to a compaction<br>
pressure Pc in order to compress the impregnated strengthener 72 via the<br>
membrane 36. This step generally completes the impregnation of the<br><br>
WO 2005/000566	PCT/CA2004/000959<br>
23<br>
strengthener 66, increases its saturation, brings the strengthener to a given<br>
thickness h and helps to maintain the contact of the impregnated strengthener<br>
72 with the base mold 32.<br>
[0108]	Indeed, since the application of the compaction pressure Pc is<br>
isotropic (i.e. in all directions), the impregnated strengthener 72 is generally<br>
. compacted uniformly, regardless of its geometrical particularities. Furthermore,<br>
it is possible to maintain the compaction pressure Pc during the cure and/or<br>
solidification phase, as will be discussed in more details in the next step, to<br>
increase the saturation of the injected part and help impart the surface finish of<br>
the contact wall 40 to the injected part.<br>
[0109]	The compaction pressure Pc being generally greater than<br>
atmospheric pressure, the final thickness h of the molded part may be<br>
controlled and parts with greater fiber contents can be manufactured. It should<br>
be noted that the compaction pressure Pc nevertheless remains below the level<br>
that would cause permanent deformation of the cover mold 34. Accordingly, the<br>
cover mold 34 is designed to withstand the compaction pressure Pc.<br>
[0110]	Cure and/or Solidification of the part<br>
[0111]	The base mold 32 is brought to the desired temperature for<br>
the cure and/or solidification of the part 82 by means of thermal resistors 84,<br>
schematically illustrated in Figure 14, or by any other suitable heating system<br>
or cooling system (not shown). The thermal resistors 84 are so configured as to<br>
radiate heat to the base mold 32 to provide means for regulating the<br>
temperature of the contact wall 40 of the mold 32.<br>
[0112]	During this phase, the compaction pressure Pc applied in the<br><br>
WO 2005/000566	PCT/CA2004/000959<br>
24<br>
compression chamber 52 helps provide a generally continuous contact of the<br>
composite part 82 with the contact wail 40 of the base moid 32. This contact<br>
has the effect of providing the part 82 with a generally conformed reproduction<br>
of the geometrical and surface finish of the contact wall 40, and is further<br>
optionally used in conjunction with a heating or cooling of the fluid 78, as stated<br>
hereinabove.<br>
[0113]	During the cure and/or solidification of the composite part, the<br>
mold helps to provide a generally continuous contact of the injected part 82<br>
with the contact wall 40 which minimizes the surface waviness and roughness<br>
of the part 82 on its surface adjacent to the contact wall 40. These phenomena<br>
sometimes result from polymerization shrinkage in the case of heat-cured<br>
polymers, or from matrix contraction during cooling or solidification of the part<br>
82.<br>
[0114]	The mold assembly 30 therefore helps to control the cure<br>
and/or the solidification of the injected part 82 such that its generated surface<br>
appearance is of a generally better quality, since the surface of the injected part<br>
82 that is adjacent to the base mold 32 optimally reproduces the finish quality<br>
of the contact wall 40. This cure and/or solidification step also helps to solidify<br>
the matrix and to control matrix cross-linking and/or micro-structure, which are<br>
the physico-chemical phenomena generally occurring during cure and/or<br>
solidification, in general, cure and/or solidification determines some physico-<br>
chemical properties of the composite part 82 such as for example mechanical<br>
resistance, anti-wear properties and so on.<br>
[011.5]	Depending on the properties desired for the composite part<br>
82 as well as the means available, the cure method alternatively uses ultra-<br>
violet (UV) light. In this case, the base moid 32, the cover mold 34 and the<br>
membrane 36 are transparent to this type of radiation.<br><br>
WO 2005/000566	PCT/CA2004/000959<br>
25<br>
[0116]	Ejection from the mold assembly<br>
[0117]	Once the cure and/or solidification  are completed, the<br>
temperature of the base mold 32 is lowered by shutting off the thermal resistor<br>
elements 84 and/or by using a cooling system (not shown) so configured as to<br>
decrease the temperature in the strengthener chamber 38.<br>
[0118]	In the example shown in Figure 15, ejection of the controliing<br>
fluid 78 (see arrow 81) by cold air injected at the vent 60 (see arrow 83)<br>
contributes at the same time to the cooling of the part 82 before its removal<br>
from the mold assembly 30. The fluid 78 is therefore evacuated from the<br>
compression chamber 52 by pump means (not shown) connected to the vent<br>
60 and expelled at the fluid control aperture 58. The cooling of the composite<br>
part 82 is also alternatively achieved by conduction of cold through the base<br>
mold 32 and the cover mold 34.<br>
[0119]	Once this fluid evacuation is completed, the moid assembly<br>
30 is opened by removing the cover mold 34 from the base mold 32, as shown<br>
in Figure 16. At that stage, the composite part 82 is still enclosed in the<br>
strengthener chamber 38 by the membrane 36 and has a composite thickness<br>
h2. The membrane 36 is then removed (see arrow 85) from the base mold 32<br>
containing the composite part 82, as shown in Figure 17.<br>
[0120]	Next, by means of usual methods of de-molding such as for<br>
example compressed air jets or mechanical ejectors (not shown), the<br>
composite part 82 is extracted from the base mold 32, as illustrated in Figure<br>
18 (see arrow 87). In general, de-molding is facilitated by the use of a releasing<br>
agent applied to the contact wall 40 and the peripheral walls 42 of the base<br>
mold 32 prior to placing the strengthener therein.<br><br>
WO 2005/000566	PCT/CA2004/000959<br>
26<br>
[0121]	According to the present invention, the mold assembly 30<br>
may be optionally configured by pre-determining the optimal thickness h of the<br>
gap 64 defined by the chambers 38, 52. This gap 64 may be determined by<br>
means of a computer simulation that helps to achieve optimal impregnation rate<br>
conditions throughout the strengthener 66, while generally minimizing the filling<br>
time.<br>
[0122]	Optionally, the total thickness h of the gap 64 does not need<br>
to be uniform along the dispersion of the strengthener 66 in the strengthener<br>
chamber 38. Indeed, a variable and adjustable thickness h helps to provide a<br>
more uniform control over the matrix progression in some portions of the<br>
strengthener 66 and allows injecting strengthened of non uniform thickness.<br>
[0123]	For example, the adjustability of thickness h is used in cases<br>
where the strengthened permeability characteristics need to be regulated or<br>
changed locally during injection, in cases where the final thickness of the<br>
composite part is not uniform, in cases where divergent or convergent flow<br>
zones exists within the strengthener chamber 38 or in cases where inserts (not<br>
shown) are included in the gap 64 or mounted on the base mold 32 and the<br>
cover mold 34.<br>
[0124]	 Also optionally, the mold assembly 30 including the base<br>
mold 32, the cover mold 34 and the membrane 36 is further provided with a<br>
means for achieving dynamic consolidation of. the liquid-saturated strengthener<br>
as in the VRTM (Vibration Resin Transfer Molding) variation of the RTM<br>
process for example, or by transmitting the mechanical vibration energy directly<br>
to the fluid.<br>
[0125]	If dynamic consolidation is used as in the VRTM process<br>
during the "compaction of the part" step described hereinabove, the vibration so<br><br>
WO 2005/000566	PCT/CA2004/000959<br>
27<br>
imposed on the impregnated strengthener 66 contributes to expel the residual .<br>
gaseous phase which is sometimes entrapped in the pores of the fibrous<br>
strengthener at the end of the compaction phase, before total solidification of<br>
the matrix.<br>
[0126]	Also optionally and as introduced in the steps of "Injection of<br>
the controlling fluid" and "Solidification of the part", heating and cooling systems<br>
may be included into the mold assembly 30. The heating and cooling systems<br>
generally involve one or both molds 32, 34 or the controlling fluid 78 during the<br>
manufacture of the composite part and may be achieved by heat transfer such<br>
as for example conduction, convection and radiation.<br>
[0127]	A mold assembly and a method of using the mold assembly<br>
according to various embodiments of the present invention will now be<br>
described with respect to Figures 19 to 32. For concision purposes, only the<br>
differences between the mold assemblies and processes of the various<br>
following embodiments and the mold assembly and process illustrated in<br>
Figures 1 to 18 will be described hereinbelow.<br>
[0128]	A mold assembly 130 and a process of manufacturing a<br>
composite part according to a second embodiment of the present invention are<br>
illustrated in Figure 19.<br>
[0129]	In this embodiment, the mold assembly 130 includes a<br>
deformable member, show in the illustrative embodiment as a membrane 136<br>
and a deformable element 131. The deformable element 131 is provided in the<br>
compression chamber 152 and has the effect of generally reducing the volume<br>
of controlling fluid injected into the compression chamber 152 via the fluid<br>
control aperture 158 and ejected via the vent 160.<br><br>
WO 2005/000566	PCT/CA2004/000959<br>
28<br>
[0130]  The deformable element 131 is generally porous and made<br>
from elastic material such as, for example, a foam polymer or any other type of<br>
open or closed-pore material. By being machined on its surface facing the<br>
strengthener 166, the deformable element 131 helps impose a shape on the<br>
composite part being manufactured. The other surface of the deformable<br>
element 131 faces the compression wall 154 of the cover mold 134.<br>
[0131]	In operation, when injected in the mold assembly 130 by an<br>
orifice in the cover mold (not shown), the deformable element 131 occupies a<br>
certain volume of the compression chamber 152 while still facilitating, due to its<br>
deformability, the flow of the matrix 170 through the strengthener 166.<br>
[0132]	Once the matrix 170 injection is completed, a minimized<br>
quantity of controlling fluid 178 is then injected into the compression chamber<br>
152 to control the penetration of the matrix 170 into the strengthener 166. The<br>
pressure applied to the fluid 178 is transmitted to the strengthener 166 through<br>
the deformable element 131. In the case of closed-pore deformable elements<br>
131, the fluid control aperture 158 and the vent 160 are in communication with<br>
the membrane 136 via the deformable element 131. Injection of the controlling<br>
fluid 178 may generate a film (not shown) in the compression chamber 152,<br>
either between the deformable element 131 and the compression wall 154 or<br>
between the membrane 136 and the deformable element 131.<br>
[0133]	Alternatively, a series of grooved channels (not shown) are<br>
machined on the surface of the deformable element 131 that is closest to the<br>
strengthener 166 to participate in transmitting pressure to the strengthener 166.<br>
In that case, the membrane 136 deforms in operation and cooperates with the<br>
grooves (not shown) of the deformable element 131.<br>
[0134]	It is to be noted that the deformable element 131, instead of<br><br>
WO 2005/000566	PCT/CA2004/000959<br>
29<br>
being shaped, is also alternatively injected directly into the cavity created by the<br>
base mold 132 and the cover mold 134 via the fluid control aperture 158. The<br>
mold 132 would nevertheless already have to contain a first strengthener 166 In<br>
order for the injected deformable element 131 to take the imprint of the<br>
strengthener 166.<br>
[0135]	In this  embodiment generally,  if the  membrane  136 is<br>
removed, the placement or the injection of the deformable element 131 in the<br>
compression chamber 152 may be used to produce a composite sandwich part<br>
with the deformable element 131 as core, in that case, a strengthener 166 is<br>
placed next to the deformable element 131 and the controlling fluid 178 is<br>
replaced by the matrix 170.<br>
[0136]	A mold assembly 230 and a process of manufacturing a<br>
composite part according to a third embodiment of the present invention are<br>
illustrated in Figures 20 and 21.<br>
[0137]	In this embodiment, the strengthener 266 is located in the<br>
base mold 232 and covered with the membrane 236 under which a vacuum<br>
may be drawn. The cover mold 234 includes a compression chamber 252<br>
.    which allows pressurizing at greater than atmospheric pressure, with the aid of<br>
either a gas or a liquid.  <br>
[0138]	The cover mold  234  needs  not be  machined  in  the<br>
compression chamber 252 and may include compartmentalized portions (not<br>
shown) delimited by the compression wall 254 which are so configured as to be<br>
independently movable toward the compression chamber 252 and the<br>
strengthener 266.<br><br>
WO 2005/000566	PCT/CA2004/000959<br>
30<br>
[0139]	In operation, the strengthener 266 is first pressurized by<br>
compressed gas injected in the compression chamber (see arrow 259), by<br>
incompressible fluid or by a combination of incompressible fluid and<br>
pressurized tubes, which will further be described hereinbelow. The<br>
compressed gas generally compresses the strengthener 266 and controls the<br>
membrane 236 deformation during injection. If the cover mold 234 includes<br>
compartmentalized portions (not shown), they may be positioned at various<br>
levels with respect to the membrane 236 to control the deformation of the<br>
membrane 236 after injection of the matrix in the strengthener 266 and via the<br>
pressure exerted on the compressed gas or control fluid.<br>
[0140]	With the  incompressible fluid,  isotropic compression  is<br>
exerted on the strengthener 266. Due to the non-compressibility of the fluid<br>
278, local deformations of the membrane 236 in the saturated zone of the<br>
strengthener 266 generally imply a deformation in the opposite direction and of<br>
equivalent volume in the non-saturated zone of the strengthener 266.<br>
[0141]	With the combination of an incompressible fluid 278 and<br>
pressurized tube 235 extending in the compression chamber 252, as illustrated<br>
in Figure 21, a controllable isotropic pressure is exerted on the strengthener<br>
266 and the compression chamber 252 by a tube 235 provided into specific<br>
locations above the strengthener 266. The tube 235 is deformable under<br>
pressure and includes at least one tube closable on both extremities. At least<br>
one extremity of the tube 235 is mounted through the cover mold 234 for<br>
operability while composite parts are being manufactured.<br>
[0142]	In operation, the pressure of the control fluid 278 is controlled<br>
by changing the pressure in the tube 235. By deforming under pressure while<br>
injected by a fluid source 278a, the tube 235 either directly physically<br>
compresses the membrane 236 and the strengthener 266 or indirectly<br><br>
WO 2005/000566	PCT/CA2004/000959<br>
31<br>
compresses the membrane 236 and the strengthener 266 via the pressure<br>
exerted on the control fluid 278 in the compression chamber 252.<br>
[0143]	It should be noted that in the second embodiment, the<br>
temperature in the compression chamber 252 may also be modified and<br>
controlled via the pressurization fluid. With the use of the tubes 235, the<br>
heating and cooling of the strengthener 266 may be achieved through the<br>
incompressible fluid, while the tubes 235 provide means for evacuating or<br>
dissipating a certain amount of heat or cold from the mold assembly 230.<br>
[0144]	A mold assembly 330 and a process of manufacturing a<br>
composite part according to a fourth embodiment of the present invention are<br>
illustrated in Figures 22 to 25.<br>
[0145]	In this embodiment, the cover mold 334 includes a machined<br>
or imprinted channel network on the compression wall 354 which faces the<br>
strengthener 366 when the cover'mold 334 is mounted on the base mold 332.<br>
The network is so configured as to allow the matrix to spread over an optimized<br>
surface of the strengthener 366, before using the controlling fluid 378.<br>
[0146]	The network includes a plurality of passages 339 which are<br>
shown in the illustrative embodiment as a generally rectangular grid or a set of<br>
channels including longitudinal passages 339a and transversal passages 339b.<br>
The distance between the compression wall 354 and the membrane 336 is<br>
sufficiently small to limit the space in which the matrix flows above the<br>
strengthener 366.<br>
[0147]	It is to be noted however that the geometry of the network,<br>
including the shape and configuration of the passages 339, is generally<br><br>
WO 2005/000566	PCT/CA2004/000959<br>
32<br>
designed to adapt to the part to manufacture, in order to favor matrix<br>
penetration into specified zones and zones of complex shape of the<br>
strengthener 366 and to minimize the average movement of the matrix from the<br>
time it is injected in the mold assembly 330 to the moment it impregnates the<br>
strengthener 366. Generally, the passages 339 are of dimensions such that<br>
they can receive a significant portion of the amount of matrix 370 required to<br>
wet the strengthener 366 completely. Optionally, the transversal passages<br>
339b are generally extending in alignment with the diffusion passages 350 and<br>
at least one longitudinal passage 339a is generally extending in alignment with<br>
an injection inlet 346.<br>
[0148]	In operation and during injection of the pressurized matrix<br>
370 via the injection inlet 346 (see arrow 371) and the diffusion passages 350<br>
(only one shown), a portion of the strengthened total volume 372 is<br>
impregnated by the matrix. The free matrix generates the deformation zone 374<br>
and deforms the membrane 336 which mates with the passages 339 of the<br>
network, expelling the excess of air from the cover mold 334 through the vents<br>
360 (see arrow 361), as seen in Figure 24.<br>
[0149]	From Figure 25, it is shown that the injection of the controlling<br>
fluid 378 via the fluid control aperture 358 (see arrow 359) propagates in the<br>
passages 339 and above the membrane 336 to force the free matrix into the<br>
strengthener 366 and favor a complete impregnation of the strengthener in the<br>
composite part 382.<br>
[0150]	A mold  assembly 430 and a process of manufacturing a<br>
composite part according to a fifth embodiment of the present invention are<br>
illustrated in Figures 26 to 28.<br>
[0151]	In this embodiment, the mold assembly 430 allows the<br><br>
WO 2005/000566	PCT/CA2004/000959<br>
33<br>
simultaneous manufacture of several composite parts using a base mold 432<br>
and a plurality of rigid frame assemblies 441a, 441b, 441c, 441 d, 441 e so<br>
configured as to define a plurality of superimposed double-chamber layers.<br>
Each layer includes a strengthener chamber 438a, 438b, 438c, 438d, 438e, a<br>
respective membrane 436a, 436b, 436c, 436d, 436e and a respective<br>
compression chamber 452a, 452b, 452c, 452d, 452e.<br>
[0152]	In the illustrative embodiment, each frame assemblies 441a,<br>
441 b, 441 c, 441 d, 441 e includes a separator 443 made of metal or of a more or<br>
less rigid foam, defining on one side the contact wall 440 and on the other side<br>
the compression wall 454 as described hereinabove. On the side of each<br>
compression wall 454, at least one fluid control aperture 458 and at (east one<br>
vent 460 extend through each frame assemblies 441 a, 441 b, 441 c, 441 d, 441 e..<br>
Also, on the side of each contact wall 440, at least one injection inlet 446 and at<br>
least one evacuation outlet 444 extend through each frame assemblies 441 a,<br>
441b, 441c, 441 d, 441 e. The base mold 432 and the frame assemblies 441a,<br>
441b, 441c, 441 d, 441 e are mounted or stacked one on top of the other as<br>
described hereinabove.<br>
[0153]	In the illustrative embodiment of Figure 26, the last frame<br>
assembly 441 e includes a cover reinforcement 434a which is mounted over its<br>
separator 443 to provide for additional rigidity and integrity of the mold<br>
assembly 430 during the manufacturing of the composite parts. Alternatively,<br>
as illustrated in Figures 27 and 28, the last frame assembly 441 e is replaced by<br>
a cover mold 434b' which has a similar configuration as the previously<br>
described cover molds.<br>
[0154]	In operation, each strengthener 466a, 466b, 466c, 466d,<br>
466e is placed in one strengthener chamber 438a, 438b, 438c, 438d, 438e and<br>
impregnated with matrix injected via the injection inlets 446 of each frame<br><br>
WO 2005/000566	PCT/CA2004/000959<br>
34<br>
assemblies 441a, 441b, 441c, 441 d, 441 e, as illustrated in Figure 27. The<br>
matrix 470 is optionally injected simultaneously into all strengthener chambers<br>
438a, 438b, 438c, 438d, 438e, or with a delay between each sequential<br>
injection of matrix in the strengthened.<br>
[0155]	The controlling fluid 478 is then injected into the compression<br>
chambers 452a, 452b, 452c, 452d, 452e via the fluid control apertures 458<br>
(see arrows 459). The excess of fluid contained In the compression chambers<br>
452a, 452b, 452c, 452d, 452e Is expelled via the vents 460 (see arrows 461).<br>
The principle of matrix flow front 476 progression and the movement of the<br>
membranes 436a, 436b, 436c, 436d, 436e due to the free matrix in the<br>
deformation zone 474 remains the same, as described in the previous<br>
embodiments and for each layer of the mold assembly 430. Injection of the fluid<br>
478 proceeds until the latter compression chamber 452e has been completely<br>
filled.<br>
[0156]	As seen in Figure 28, each composite part 482e is then<br>
compressed between the separator 443 on one side and the membrane 336e<br>
pressurized by the controlling fluid 478 on the other side. This step therefore<br>
provides a generally similar degree of compression for all composite parts,<br>
which are at the same time more protected against the risk of defects due to<br>
warping, since each face of the strengthener generally sees a similar<br>
compression force.<br>
[0157]  For the cure and/or the solidification step, the base mold 432<br>
is brought to the desired temperature as in the general case. Once initiated, the<br>
polymerization of the liquid matrix is generally accompanied by heat<br>
dissipation, which participates in upward heat flux diffusion, such that this<br>
exothermic polymerization reaction occurring in the base mold 432 initiates the<br>
cure of the composite part located in the frame assembly immediately above.<br><br>
WO 2005/000566	PCT/CA2004/000959<br>
35<br>
The composite parts are therefore sequentially cured in the stack of frame<br>
assemblies 441a, 441b, 441c, 441 d, 441 e.<br>
[0158]    .	The energy used to heat any lower frame assembly is<br>
generally transferred from one layer to the next one rather than being used for<br>
cure only a single composite part. It should be noted that heating elements are<br>
optionally included in the vicinity of compression chambers 452a, 452b, 452c,<br>
452d, 452e or in intermediate combinations of frame assemblies 441a, 441b,<br>
441 c, 441 d, 441 e to accelerate the cure process.<br>
[0159]	A mold assembly 530 and a process of manufacturing a<br>
composite part according to a sixth embodiment of the present invention are<br>
illustrated in Figures 29 to 33.<br>
[0160]	In this embodiment, the mold assembly 530 includes a base<br>
mold 532, a cover mold 534 and a plurality of frame assemblies 541a, 541b,<br>
541c, 541 d. The number of frame assemblies 541a, 541b, 541c, 541 d varies<br>
depending on the number of parts to be manufactured simultaneously.<br>
[0161]	The mold assembly 530 is also provided with injection inlets<br>
546 and evacuation outlets 544 in order to allow injection of the matrix over the<br>
strengthened 566a, 566b, 566c, 566d as well as evacuation of air and excess<br>
matrix. In the illustrative embodiment, the evacuation outlet 544 and the<br>
injection inlet 546 are extending through the plurality of frame assemblies 541a,<br>
541b, 541c, 541 d that are stacked on the base mold 532 and covered by the<br>
cover mold 534.<br>
[0162]	When mounted one on top of the other as described<br>
hereinabove, the base mold 532, and the plurality of frame assemblies 541a,<br><br>
WO 2005/000566	PCT/CA2004/000959<br>
36<br>
541b, 541c, 541 d define a stacking chamber 545 in which layers of<br>
.strengtheners 566a, 566b, 566c, 566d, separators 543a, 543b, 543c and the<br>
cover mold 534 are to be alternatively placed one on top of the other.<br>
[0163]	The separators 543a, 543b, 543c participate in providing the<br>
shape during the manufacture of the composite parts and include on one side a<br>
machined compression wall 554 and on the other side, a machined contact wall<br>
540. The compression wall 554 faces the contact wall 540 of the base mold<br>
532 or the contact wall 540 of the separator located just below.<br>
[0164]	The separators 543a, 543b, 543c are made from sufficiently<br>
compressible material to allow themselves to generally deform upon injection of<br>
matrix into the strengtheners 566a, 566b, 566c, 566d, but sufficiently rigid at<br>
the same time to transmit the effect of the pressure of the matrix injected into<br>
' one strengthener to neighboring strengtheners in the stacking chamber 545.<br>
[0165] • The cover mold 534 includes a compression wall 554 facing<br>
the contact wall 540 of the separator 543c located below and a punch 547<br>
adapted to compress via the cover mold 534 the strengtheners 566a, 566b,<br>
566c, 566d and the separators 543a, 543b; 543c contained between the base<br>
mold 532 and the cover mold 534. The shapes of the contact walls 540 and the<br>
compression walls 554 are so configured as to define the composite part to<br>
manufacture.<br>
[0166]	Using this mold assembly 530, several replicates of a same<br>
part may be obtained during one manufacturing process, without significantly<br>
diminishing the final composite part quality. This process may also be adapted<br>
to the mass production of structural parts, since the surface finish obtained by<br>
this approach on one side of the composite part is generally less critical and<br>
does not have to be of the same quality as for the parts manufactured by the<br><br>
WO 2005/000566	PCT/CA2004/000959<br>
37<br>
other embodiments described hereinabove using a compression chamber, a<br>
strengthener chamber and a membrane.<br>
[0167]	.    In operation, the first strengthener 566a is slidably placed<br>
over the base mold 532 and laterally held in place by the first frame assembly<br>
541 a. The first separator 543a is then placed above the first strengthener 566a.<br>
This procedure is repeated the number of times necessary to obtain the desired<br>
number of composite parts, then the stack of strengtheners 566a, 566b, 566c,<br>
566d and separators 543a, 543b 543c are covered with the cover mold 534.<br>
[0168]	As seen in the illustrative embodiment of Figure 30, the<br>
method includes a successive injection of the matrix 570 into the strengtheners<br>
566a, 566b, 566c, 566d via the injection inlets 546, with a slight delay between<br>
each injection.<br>
[0169]	The matrix 570 is injected (see arrows 571) under pressure<br>
into the first strengthener 566a, which brings about a deformation of the first<br>
separator 543a, as described hereinabove. Since no significant force opposes<br>
the movement of the first separator 543a, the latter presses the second<br>
strengthener 566b along the same direction.<br>
[0170]	The matrix flow front 576a progresses along the strengthener<br>
566a. After the matrix flow front 576a reaching an optimized progression in the<br>
strengthener 566a, injection begins in the second, strengthener 566b. The<br>
matrix 570 injected under pressure produces the same effect as described in<br>
the previous paragraph for the first injection, and generally deforms the<br>
. separators located above 543b and beneath 543a the second strengthener<br>
566b. The first strengthener 566a is thus generally compressed over the<br>
distance of propagation of the matrix flow front 576b into the second<br>
strengthener  566b.  All  the  other  injections  of  matrix  in  subsequent<br><br>
WO 2005/000566	PCT/CA2004/000959<br>
38<br>
strengtheners are performed in a similar manner.<br>
[0171]	The last strengthener 566d has the particularity of not<br>
allowing the matrix under pressure injected therethrough to deform the rigid<br>
cover mold 534 located above the strengthener 566d. As a result, the matrix<br>
570 compresses the layers of strengthener 566a, 566b, 566c located<br>
underneath.<br>
[01721	The impregnation of the matrix in the strengthened 566a,<br>
566b, 566c, 566d and the progression of the matrix flow front 576a, 576b,<br>
576c, 576d are thus regulated by the pressure applied by the contact wall 540<br>
on the strengtheners 566a, 566b, 566c, 566d and generally corresponds to the<br>
pressure applied on the strengthener located above. During this impregnation<br>
step, the excess of fluid or gas in the vicinity of strengtheners 566a, 566b,<br>
566c, 566d or the excess of matrix may be expelled via the evacuation outlet<br>
544 (see arrows 545).<br>
[0173]	The compaction step generally increases the fiber content of<br>
the composite parts manufactured and improves the reproducibility of the parts<br>
manufactured in a stack according to this embodiment. This step is usually<br>
performed by applying a compression force to the cover mold 534 via the<br>
punch 547 (see arrow 549), as illustrated in Figure 31. The stiffness of the<br>
separators 543a, 543b, 543c is generally sufficient to cause compaction of the<br>
impregnated strengtheners 582a, 582b, 582c, 582d, in compliance with the<br>
geometry of the separators 543a, 543b, 543c. For this reason, the crushing of<br>
the separators 543a, 543b, 543c remains generally minimal.<br>
[0174]	. In this embodiment, the consolidation of the composite parts<br>
582a, 582b, 582c, 582d generally occurs in one direction, which is not<br>
necessarily a direction normal to the surfaces of the composite parts 582a,<br><br>
WO 2005/000566	PCT/CA2004/000959<br>
39<br>
582b, 582c, 582d. In the previous embodiments, the compaction of the parts is<br>
usually performed by the controlling fluid proving a compression loading normal<br>
to the surface of the composite part.<br>
[0175]	However, a controlling fluid 578 may be optionally injected<br>
between the cover mold 534 provided or not with a membrane covering the last<br>
strengthener 582d. Alternatively, as illustrated in Figure 33, each strengthener<br>
566a, 566b, 566c, 566d is covered with a membrane 536 so configured as to<br>
interact with a controlling fluid injected simultaneously between each separator<br>
543a, 543b, 543c. in.these cases, the controlling fluid can be injected either<br>
into a porous separator 543a, 543b, 543c, or as illustrated in Figure 33, directly<br>
between the separators 543a, 543b, 543c and an added membrane covering<br>
the strengtheners 582a, 582b, 582c, 582d.<br>
[0176]	Also alternatively, the membrane 536 is inserted between the<br>
separators 543a, 543b, 543c and the strengtheners 582a, 582b, 582c, 582d,<br>
such that the controlling fluid can still be injected either into the porous<br>
separators 543a, 543b, 543c, or directly between the separators 543a, 543b,<br>
543c and the strengtheners 582a, 582b, 582c, 582d.<br>
[0177]	The cure step generally corresponds to the cure step<br>
described in the fourth embodiment of the present invention. As shown in<br>
Figure 32 of the illustrative embodiment, the compression force is maintained<br>
on the mold assembly 530 during the cure and/or the solidification step which<br>
more particularly involves cure and/or solidification of the first composite part<br>
582a followed by the subsequent cure and/or solidification of the remaining<br>
composite parts 582b, 582c, 582d (see arrow 551). Once cure is completed, a<br>

WO 2005/000566	PCT/CA2004/000959<br>
40<br>
composite part according to a seventh embodiment of the present invention are<br>
illustrated in Figure 34.<br>
[0179]	In this embodiment, the mold assembly 630 includes a<br>
porous medium 653 provided in the compression chamber 652 of the cover<br>
mold 634 which generally controls or reduces the speed at which the fluid<br>
injected from the fluid control aperture 658 to the vent 660 progresses in the<br>
compression chamber 652. Alternatively, the porous medium is replaced by a<br>
granular medium such as for example sand or by a fibrous medium.<br>
[0180]	The porous medium 653 is a generally deformable element<br>
131 which in operation, allows the passage of the fluid through itself, but its<br>
porous composition significantly helps to control or restrain the propagation of<br>
the flow of control fluid. In some instances, depending on the physical<br>
properties of the strengthened of the chemical properties of the matrix, of the<br>
nature of the control fluid and on the pressure and temperature conditions while<br>
the mold assembly 630 is in operation, the flow propagation of control fluid may<br>
need to be controlled with respect to the flow propagation of the matrix in the<br>
strengthened<br>
[0181]	For instance, a control fluid flowing in the compression<br>
chamber 652 from the fluid control aperture 658 to the vent 660 generally<br>
provides an efficient and non-uniform compression of the membrane 636 in the<br>
region swollen by the free matrix so as to facilitate the flow of the free matrix<br>
toward the strengthener. By having a porous medium 653 in the compression<br>
chamber 652, the propagation of the control fluid in the compression chamber<br>
652 may be delayed such that the control fluid flow front (not shown) does not<br>
go beyond the matrix flow front, in order to efficiently help impregnate the<br>
strengthener with the matrix.<br><br>

departing from the spirit and nature of the subject invention as defined in the<br>
appended claims.<br><br>
