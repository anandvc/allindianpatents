THE PATENTS ACT 1970<br>
[39 OF 1970]<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10, Rule 13]<br>
"A SECONDARY BATTERY CHARGING DEVICE"<br>
HONDA GIKEN KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA, a corporation of Japan, 1-1, Minamiaoyama 2-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br>
fe 5 APR 2006<br><br>
electrode material for an anode and suited for charging the secondary battery.<br>
[0002] [Prior Art]<br>
In the charging device of the prior art, as disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. Hei6-315233, in order to compensate the defects of a charge end decision based on the changing rate of a terminal voltage and a charge end decision based on the changing rate of a battery temperature thereby to prevent a drop in the battery lifetime and an erroneous decision of the charge end, as might otherwise be caused by an overcharge, the full charge (of 100 %) has been decided by using both the changing rate of the terminal voltage of the battery and the changing rate of the temperature as parameters.<br>
[0003]<br>
When the charge of the battery is completed in a fully charged state, a nickel-cadmium cell or a nickel-hydrogen cell adopting a nickel oxide as an electrode material for the anode can be suppressed from such a rise in its internal pressure as might otherwise be caused by an oxygen gas to be emitted from the anode just before the full charge. It is, therefore, unnecessary to consume the oxygen gas on the cathode surface by the local cell reaction. It is accordingly unnecessary to adopt the so-called "charge reserve", in which the capacity of the cathode is made larger than that of the anode, so that<br>
3<br><br>
the battery can be small-sized.<br>
[0004] [Problems to Be Solved by the Invention]<br>
The aforementioned prior art (i.e., Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. Hei6-315233 ) has to monitor not only the terminal voltage of the battery but also the battery temperature and is therefore troubled by a problem that the charging device is complicated and large-sized. Even if the changing rate of the battery temperature is added to the parameters for deciding the charge end based on the changing rate of the terminal voltage, moreover, there is another problem that a precise decision of the charge end is still difficult.<br>
[0005]<br>
An object of the invention is to solve the aforementioned problems of the prior art and to provide a secondary battery charging method and device which can reduce the size of a secondary battery adopting a nickel oxide as an electrode material for an anode thereby to charge sufficient charge with a simple construction.<br>
[0006] [Means for Solving the Problems]<br>
In order to achieve the aforementioned object, according to the present invention, there is provided a secondary battery charging device adopting a nickel oxide as an electrode material for an anode, characterized by comprising: charging<br>
4<br><br>
voltage detecting means for detecting the terminal voltage of a secondary battery being charged; quadratic changing rate detecting means for detecting the change in the changing rate of said terminal voltage; and charge ending means for ending the charge when the change in said changing rate is lower than a predetermined reference changing rate.<br>
[0007]<br>
The changing rate of the changing rate of the charging voltage of the battery, i.e., the quadratic changing rate represents the amount of charge of the battery. Especially just before the full charge at the second half of the charge, the changing rate of the charging voltage turns its rising rate from positive to negative. If the charge is ended when the quadratic changing rate of the charging voltage lowers to the predetermined reference changing rate, therefore, the charge can be ended before the emission of oxygen from the anode becomes vigorous, merely by monitoring the terminal voltage of the battery. In other words, the charge end of the secondary battery can be precisely decided with the simple construction. As a result, the secondary battery can be reduced in the cathode capacity so that the battery can be small-sized.<br>
[0008] [Embodiments of the Invention]<br>
The present invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.  Fig. 1 is a block<br>
5<br><br>
diagram showing a charging device according to one embodiment of the invention, and Fig. 2 is a diagram for explaining a mechanism for deciding a charge end in the invention.<br>
[0009]<br>
According to our experimental results, the emission of an oxygen gas from the anode is especially activated just before the full charge (i.e., at about 97% of the fully charged state) in the second half of the charge, so that the changing rate<br>
AV/At of a charging voltage Vch turns negative from a positive one, as illustrated in Fig. 2. If this transition point (or time t2) can be detected, therefore, the charge can be interrupted just before the full charge, and the emission of oxygen from the anode can be suppressed while retaining the charge of about 97% of the full charge.<br>
[0010]<br>
In the embodiment, therefore, noting the changing rate of the changing rate AV/At of the charging voltage Vch, that is, the quadratic changing rate A(AV)/A(At), the charge is ended when the quadratic changing rate A(AV)/A(At) becomes substantially zero. Depending upon the temperature or degradation of the battery, however, the quadratic changing<br>
rate A(AV)/A(At) can be substantially zero, as illustrated in Fig. 2, even just before the intrinsic transition point (or time tl). In the embodiment, therefore, the temperature and the degradation of the battery are also employed as the<br>
6<br><br>
parameters for detecting the charge end so that only the transition point<br>
just before the full charge may be detected without fail.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a secondary battery charging device adopting a nickel oxide as an electrode material for an anode, comprising:<br>
charging   voltage   detecting   means   for   detecting   the   terminal<br>
voltage of a secondary battery being charged,<br>
quadratic changing rate detecting means for detecting the change<br>
in the changing rate of said terminal voltage,<br>
charge ending means for ending the charge when the change in<br>
said   changing  rate   is  lower  than   a  predetermined  reference<br>
changing rate, and<br>
a second half charging voltage operating means for determining a second half charging voltage or the terminal voltage at the time when the secondary battery being charged is close to a fully charged state, as functions of the degradation state and the temperature of said battery,<br>
wherein said charge ending means ends the charge when the<br>
terminal voltage of the secondary battery being charged is higher<br>
than said second half charging voltage and when the change in<br>
the   changing   rate   of  said   terminal  voltage   is   lower   than   a<br>
predetermined reference changing rate.<br>

[0011]<br>
In Fig. 1, a charging current generator 11 outputs a charging current Ich for charging a secondary battery 12. A voltage detector 14 detects the charging voltage Vch. A voltage changing rate detector 15 detects the time changing<br>
rate Av/At of the charging voltage Vch. A quadratic changing rate detector 16 detects the time quadratic changing rate<br>
A(AV)/A(At) of the aforementioned time changing rate AV/At. A comparator 17 compares the aforementioned quadratic changing<br>
rate A(AV)/A(At) and a reference value Vref, and outputs the comparison result to a charge end decider 25.<br>
[0012]<br>
The aforementioned reference value Vref is preset to a quadratic changing rate, at which the charge of the secondary battery 12 corresponds to about 97 % of the full charge, and can be exemplified by "0" or a value corresponding to "0".<br>
[0013]<br>
A temperature sensor 2 0 detects the temperature Teh of the secondary battery 12.  A temperature changing rate<br>
detector 21 detects the time changing rate AT/At of the battery temperature Teh. A comparator 22 compares the aforementioned<br>
temperature changing rate AT/At and the reference value Tref,<br>
9<br><br>
and outputs the comparison result to the charge end decider 25. The battery temperature Teh rises abruptly just before the full charge, as illustrated in Fig. 2. In the embodiment, therefore, the aforementioned reference value Tref is set to 0.2 °C/sec, and it is decided that the state is just before the full charge, when the temperature changing rate AT/At exceeds the reference value Tref.<br>
[0014]<br>
A current detector 13 detects the aforementioned charging current Ich. A Vcut calculator 18 calculates a terminal voltage (i.e., a second half charging voltage) Vcut corresponding to 90 to 95 % of the theoretical full charge state further before (97 %) of the full charge of the battery, on the basis of the following Formula (1). Here, a coefficient<br>
a indicates the internal resistance coefficient of the secondary battery and ranges within 0.001 to 0.01.   A<br>
coefficient (3 indicates a temperature coefficient relating to the internal resistance of the secondary battery and ranges<br>
within 0.01 to 0.1. A coefficient y  indicates a degradation coefficient relating to the internal resistance of the secondary battery and ranges within 0 to 0.2. [0015]<br>
Vcut = 1.4 + (Ich - 1.6)cc + (25 - Teh)(3 + y<br>
(1).<br>
[0016]<br>
10<br><br>
A comparator 19 compares the aforementioned second half charging voltage Vcut and the present charging voltage Vch, and outputs the comparison result to the charge end decider 25.<br>
[0017]<br>
The charge end decider 25 decides the continuation or end of the charge on the basis of the individual comparison results of the aforementioned comparators 17, 19 and 22, and instructs the aforementioned charging current generator 111 the charge end when the charge is to be ended.<br>
[0018]<br>
Here will be described the actions of the aforementioned first embodiment with reference to the flow chart of Fig. 3. When the charge is started, the terminal voltage of the secondary battery is detected at Step SI as the charging voltage Vch by the aforementioned voltage detector 14. At Step S2, the charging current ich is detected by the aforementioned current detector 13.<br>
[0019]<br>
At Step S3, the second half charging voltage Vcut is calculated at the aforementioned Vcut operator on the basis of the aforementioned Formula (1). At Step S4, the aforementioned charging voltage Vch and the second half charging voltage Vcut are compared at the comparator 19. If the charging voltage Vch exceeds the second half charging<br>
11<br><br>
voltage Vcut, the routine advances to Step S5 to decide the charge end.<br>
[0020]<br>
At Step S5, the surface temperature Teh of the secondary battery 12 is detected by the aforementioned temperature sensor<br>
20. At Step S6, the changing rate AT/At of the battery temperature Teh is calculated at the aforementioned temperature changing rate detector 21 on the basis of the present battery temperature Teh and the preceding battery<br>
temperature. At Step SI, the temperature changing rate AT/At is compared at the comparator 22 with the reference value Tref.<br>
If the temperature changing rate AT/At exceeds the reference value Tref, the routine advances to Step S8 to decide the charge end.<br>
[0021]<br>
At Step S8, the changing rate Av/At of the charging voltage Vch is calculated at the aforementioned changing rate detector 15 on the basis of the present charging voltage Vch and the preceding charging voltage. At Step S9, the changing rate A(AV)/A(At) of the aforementioned changing rate AV/At is calculated at the quadratic changing rate detector 16 . At Step<br>
S10, the quadratic changing rate A(AV)/A(At) of the charging voltage and the reference value Vref are compared at the comparator 17. [0022]<br>
12<br><br>
If the quadratic changing rate A(AV) /A(At) is not smaller than reference value Vref, it is decided that the state is not just before the full charge yet, and the routine advances to Step Sll. At Step Sll, the charging voltage Vch is detected again, and the routine of Steps S8 to S10 is repeated. If the<br>
quadratic changing rate A(AV)/A(At) is smaller than the reference value Vref, on the contrary, it is decided that the state is just before the full charge, and the routine advances to Step S12. At Step S12, the charge end decider 25 decides the charge ending timing and instructs the aforementioned charging current generator 11 the termination of charge.<br>
[0023]<br>
According to the embodiment, the charge of the secondary battery can be precisely ended just before the full charge so that the emission of oxygen from the anode can be suppressed to prevent the degradation of the cathode.<br>
[0024]<br>
When the charge is ended just before the fully charged state as in the embodiment, the amount of charge is less than that of the case in which the full charge is made as in the prior art while allowing an overcharge. In the embodiment, however, the charge can be ended before the oxygen emission from the anode becomes vigorous, so that any charging reservation for compensating the gradual reduction in the cathode capacity need not be retained.  Therefore, the<br>
13<br><br>
additional ratio of the cathode capacity to the anode capacity can be made smaller than that of the prior art so that the charging capacity itself of the battery can be made more than that of the prior art.<br>
[0025]<br>
Figs. 4 and 5 are diagrams showing such relations between the anode capacity and the cathode capacity of the secondary battery as are suited for the individual charging devices of the embodiment and the prior art.<br>
[0026]<br>
The prior art has found it difficult to decide the charge end precisely and it liable to have a larger degree of overcharge. As illustrated in Fig. 5, therefore, the theoretical capacity of the cathode has been set to a value corresponding to 1.6 times as large as that of the anode capacity while estimating the increase/decrease in the capacity due to the local cell reaction.<br>
[0027]<br>
However, the charging capacity of the battery is determined in its rate by the anode. Even if the cathode capacity is exclusively increased, therefore, the result is that the battery is only large-sized without any increase in the charging capacity. As illustrated in Fig. 5, more specifically, the cathode capacity is about 6.1 A, but the charging capacity of the battery is just 3 . 7 A, as corresponding<br>
14<br><br>
to the anode capacity. In the prior art, therefore, the battery can be charged up to the fully charged state, but the charging capacity obtained is lower than the total capacity of the anode and the cathode.<br>
[0028]<br>
According to the embodiment, on the contrary, the oxygen emission from the anode can be suppressed to reduce the gradual decrease of the cathode capacity. Therefore, the cathode capacity may be about 1.2 times as large as the value 1.0 of the anode capacity, so that the increase of the cathode capacity to the anode capacity can be made smaller. Where the total capacity of the anode and the cathode is 9.7 A as in Fig. 5, the anode capacity can be increased up to 4 . 5 A in the embodiment so that a larger charging capacity than that of the prior art can be retained even the charge is ended before the full charge (about 97 % of the full charge) . In another aspect, according to the embodiment, a charging capacity equivalent to that of the prior art can be obtained from a smaller battery than that of the prior art so that the battery can be small-sized.<br>
[0029]<br>
Here has been described the foregoing embodiment in which the charge is ended on condition that the quadratic changing rate of the charging voltage Vch is lower than the reference<br>
value Vref, when the changing rate AT/At of the battery temperature Teh exceeds the reference value Tref and when the<br>
15<br><br>
charging voltage Vch exceeds the second half charging voltage Vcut. However, the charge may be ended only on condition that the quadratic changing rate of the charging voltage Vch is lower than the reference value Vref.<br>
[0030]<br>
Alternatively, the charge end may be decided either on<br>
the basis of the changing rate AT/At of the battery temperature Teh and the quadratic changing rate of the charging voltage Vch or on the basis of the second half charging voltage Vcut and the quadratic changing rate of the charging voltage Vch. Moreover, the charge may be ended on condition not that the<br>
changing rate AT/At of the battery temperature Teh exceeds the reference value Tref but that the battery temperature Teh exceeds the reference value.<br>
[0031]<br>
[Effects of the Invention]<br>
According to the present invention, there are achieved the following effects.<br>
[0032]<br>
(1) According to the invention, the charge can be ended before the emission of oxygen from the anode becomes vigorous, merely by monitoring the terminal voltage of the battery. In short, the charge end can be precisely decided with the simple construction.<br>
[0033]<br>
16<br><br>
(2) According to the invention, the charge of the secondary battery can be precisely ended just before the full charge so that the oxygen emission from the anode can be eliminated to prevent the degradation of the cathode.<br>
[0034]<br>
According to the invention, the degradation of the cathode can be prevented to make the cathode capacity of the battery smaller than that of the prior art so that the anode capacity can be accordingly increased. It is, therefore, possible to make the charging capacity itself of the battery bigger than that of the prior art or to achieve a charging capacity equivalent to that of the prior art with a smaller battery than that of the prior art.<br>
[0035]<br>
(4) According to the invention, the charge end can be decided only on the basis of the terminal voltage of the battery thereby to simplify the charging circuit and to reduce the size and weight of the same.<br>
