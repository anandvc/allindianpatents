Flow directing insert for a reactor chamber<br>
The present invention relates to a flow direcling insert in a reactor<br>
chamber in a reactor, which reactor chamber has a mainly square-<br>
5     shaped cross-section and has an inlet at one corner of the chamber and<br>
an outlet at a another corner of the chamber. At least one of the walls of<br>
the reactor chamber consists of a solid heat conductive material or a<br>
membrane.<br>
10     Conventional reactors for carrying through different kinds of chemical<br>
reactions in a batch-wise manner have usually been in the shape of a<br>
vessel of a suitable dimension into which the reactants are poured and<br>
allowed to react during a predetermined reaction time. The vessel is<br>
usually provided with mixing means. If it is necessary to heat or cool the<br>
15     reactants the vessel may have been provided with a heating or cooling<br>
mantle or healing or cooling coils, which are immersed in the reactants.<br>
The heat transfer characteristics of such an arrangement is poor as well<br>
as the mixing.<br>
20     Another type of reactor making it possible to carry through reactions<br>
continuously consists of tube reactors comprising tubes of suitable length,<br>
through which the reactants are made to flow. Such an arrangement<br>
gives possibility to control the holding time especially at turbulent<br>
conditions, if the reactants should be heated or cooled, the tube may be<br>
25     surrounded by a shell, through which heating or cooling medium is forced<br>
to flow.<br>
In the latest time plate reactors often called micro-reactors for carrying<br>
through catalytic reactions have been presented to the market. These<br>
30     micro reactors are often used in connection with fuel cells. Such a micro-<br><br>
2<br>
reactor is described for example in EP 1 091 800, which shows a<br>
compact, catalytic reactor built up of piled textured plates forming reaction<br>
spaces and heat-bearing spaces. The texture may be in the form of<br>
channels aiming at a good distribution of the reaction liquid.<br>
5<br>
This type of reactors may also be used on a larger scale.<br>
Flow directing inserts are known in many connections in order to divide a<br>
flow and to ensure that the flow direction constantly is changed. These<br>
10     inserts consist of different kinds of packing material, which is available in<br>
different materials and configurations. WO 01/94006 describes an<br>
example of a tube reactor of this kind with reaction tubes with modular<br>
packing that create turbulence in order to promote fluid flow through the<br>
packing material.<br>
15<br>
The present invention aims at providing a reactor chamber with a flow<br>
directing insert which makes it possible to get a precise hydrodynamic<br>
control of the flow conditions for the reactants which are to pass the<br>
reactor chamber. This goal is obtained in that the insert comprises a<br>
20     number of units arranged in rows, which units together with the walls of<br>
the chamber define a changel for a fluid, which channel extends from a<br>
first side of the chamber to a second side of the chamber and back again<br>
to the first side backwards and forwards a number of times and that the<br>
units are arranged such that the fluid is forced to flow between the units in<br>
25     a serpentine path. The insert according to the invention, which forces the<br>
fluid to change flow direction frequently, brings about turbulent flow<br>
conditions that efficiently prevent the occurrence of layers of fluid flowing<br>
at different flow rates and no stagnant zones are found. High mixing rates<br>
are obtained and a narrow distribution of the residence tine is obtained.<br>
30<br><br>
3<br>
The fluid reactants passing the channel may be pure liquids, mixtures of<br>
liquids, liquids with particles or liquids with dissolved or free gas.<br>
The insert may have a square-shaped form and a square-shaped cross-<br>
5     section. The length of each row in the insert may be considerably larger<br>
than the distance between two opposite waifs in the reactor chamber.<br>
The mentioned opposite walls may one or both consist of a heat<br>
conductive material, which make it possible to let a cooling or heating<br>
fluid pass outside the channel. One of the walls or both may alternatively<br>
10     consist of a membrane of a suitable pore size making it possible to let a<br>
formed product or products pass the membrane. Combinations of walls of<br>
these kinds may also be possible.<br>
The square-shaped insert may if so is desired be rolled to a tube or in a<br>
16     spiral In such a case the walls of the reactor chamber must ot course be<br>
given the same shape.<br>
The units in the flow directing insert of the invention is with advantage<br>
designed such that each unit has one plane surface intended to abut one<br>
20     wall of the reactor chamber or the plane side of another unit in a<br>
tightening manner. The unit has an extension that is less than the<br>
distance between two opposite walls in the reactor chamber.<br>
The flow directing insert is advantageously built up in such a way that<br>
25     each row of units is separated from an adjacent row of units by delimiting<br>
means, which abuts the walls of the reactor chamber in a tightening way.<br>
The reaction chamber may be arranged such that the fluid flows through<br>
the reaction chamber by the action of gravity, that is the inlet to the<br>
chamber may be situated above the outlet,  it is of course also possible to<br>
30     make the fluid pass through the chamber driven by pump drive, which<br><br>
4<br>
means that the in- and outlet to the chamber are situated on the same<br>
level.<br>
The unite in the flow directing insert have with advantage a side opposite<br>
5     to the plane surface with a softly bended shape, for example a cylindrical<br>
shape, in this manner there is obtained very favourable flow conditions.<br>
In a flow directing insert according to the invention there is<br>
advantageously a connection between two adjacent rows of units in the<br>
10     reactor chamber, which is obtained in that there is an opening between<br>
one end of a row and a reactor wall and also between the next row of<br>
units and the same reactor wall. In this way the fluid may flow from one<br>
row to the other in the created empty space,<br>
15     The flow directing insert may contain at least two units in at least two<br>
rows one adjacent the other which are arranged such that an opening in a<br>
cylindrical part of one unit co-operating with an opening in the delimiting<br>
means together with an opening in the cylindrical part of a second unit<br>
form a passage extending through a part of the insert or through the<br>
20     whole insert. Such passages give a possibility to create a connection<br>
between an inlet at one end of the reactor chamber and the flow of fluid<br>
anywhere in the reactor chamber. The passages may be used for<br>
injecting a liquid or gas reactant into the flow of fluid. They may also be<br>
used for taking samples or measuring for example temperature or<br>
25     pressure. If so is desired a cooiing or heating medium may be conducted<br>
through the formed passages.<br>
The flow directing insert containing a desired number of rows and<br>
delimiting means is with advantage manufactured in one piece.<br><br>
5<br>
Depending on the desired material in the insert it may for example be<br>
manufactured by moulding, pressing, milling or by casting.<br>
The flow directing insert containing a number of units and limits may<br>
5     alternatively be produced in pieces of column shape, which together form<br>
the insert. This may be necessary if the units have a softly bended form<br>
also close to the plane surface.<br>
One especially suitable material for manufacturing the insert consists of<br>
10     polyethere therketone, PEEK. Other materials may be carbon, glass or<br>
metal.<br>
The flow controlling insert according to the invention will be further<br>
described with reference to the attached drawings which show two<br>
15     examples of embodiments of the flow directing insert. These<br>
embodiments have been chosen as examples only.<br>

FjgL 15 shows how ten units in three rows form a part of an insert.<br>
Fig, 16 shows an insert Jocated In a reaction chamber in a plate seen<br>
both from the front and from the back.<br>
Fig. 17 shows a perspective view of a part of an example of a reactor with<br>
10     a reactor chamber containing inserts according to the invention.<br>
In fig. 1 there is shown a single unit 1 seen from one side, which unit 1<br>
together with similar units arranged in rows form an insert for a reactor<br>
chamber. The unit 1 has a plane surface 2 and upper and lower square-<br>
15     shaped limits 3, 4.<br>
The, unit 1 has a cylindrical part 5 on its side opposite to the plane surface<br>
as may be seen in fig. 2. which shows a cross-section of the unit,<br>
2Q     In fig. 3 the unit 1 is seen from the side. As may be seen in fig. 2 and 3<br>
there is formed a free space 6 within the unit limited by the extension of<br>
the limits 3 and 4. This free space is intended for the fluidT which shall<br>
pass the reactor chamber.<br>
25     In fig. 4 there is shown how nine units 1 are arranged in relation to each<br>
other in order to form the insert for the reactor chamber. As may be seen<br>
In fig. 4 the nine units shown in the figure are arranged such that the<br>
plane surface of the first and third units in every row are turned at the<br>
same side, whereas the second unit m each row is turned 180 D irt<br>
3D     relation to the first and third unit In this way the plane surfaces of the<br><br>
7<br>
units define an area (surface), which together with the walls of the reactor<br>
chamber (not shown here) form a meander shaped channel for the fluid.<br>
The fluid flows through the free spaces 6 between the units and between<br>
the cylindrical part 5 of the unite and the walls of the reaction chamber.  In<br>
5     order to bring the fluid to flow in the formed channel it is of course<br>
necessary that the plane surface of the units abuts the adjacent wall such<br>
that no fluid may by-pass the channel. The upper 3 and lower 4 limits of<br>
the unrts 1 define alone and together delimiting means between the rows.<br>
10     In these drawings the rows of the insert are built up of single units. If so is<br>
desired it is of course possible to build up an insert containing units,<br>
where two units turn their plane surfaces against each other. This gives<br>
an efficient distribution of the flow at the cost of the possibility to<br>
accurately control the residence time distribution in the chamber.<br>
15<br>
In fig. 5 there is shown two units intended to be arranged in rows adjacent<br>
to each other. Both these units have an opening 7 in the cylindrical part of<br>
the unit that extends through the unit from the upper 3 to the lower 4 limit.<br>
With such an arrangement it is possible to connect an inlet at one end of<br>
20     the reactor chamber such that a flow of injected fluid is added to a flow of<br>
the first fluid at any desired point in the reactor chamber. The connection<br>
is established in that a unit with an opening 7 also has an opening<br>
anywhere in the surface of the cylindrical part of the unit, which two<br>
openings are connected somewhere in the unit It is also possible to have<br>
25     a number of units with openings in a number of adjacent rows such that<br>
there is, formed a passage, which extends all the way through the insert.<br>
In fig. 6 there is shown a cross-section of a number of units 1 provided<br>
with openings 7. The individual limits 4 of the units form together the<br>
30     delimiting means 8. At the right end of the figure there is a cavity 9 in the<br><br>
8<br>
delimiting means 8. This cavity 9 makes it possible for the fluid to flow<br>
from one row of units to an adjacent row of units.<br>
Fig 7, shows three rows of units provided with openings 7. As may be<br>
5     seen in the drawing (he uppermost delimiting means 8 extends somewhat<br>
longer to the right than the next delimiting means. This space<br>
corresponds to the cavity 9 shown in figure 6. A fluid, which is to flow<br>
through the reactor chamber (no walls are shown in this figure), enters<br>
the reaction chamber through an inlet (not shown) situated in close<br>
10     vicinity to the left end of the uppermost row of units. The fluid then flows<br>
in a serpentine path in the free space 6 between the units, until it reaches,<br>
the right end of the uppermost row. Due to the cavity 9 the fluid may then<br>
pass to the next row and flow through the free space between the units<br>
from right to left. As may be seen in the figure there is a corresponding<br>
15     cavity in the third delimiting means 8, giving the fluid the possibility to<br>
enter the third row of units, in this drawing the insert is shown standing.<br>
Of course it is just as possible that the insert is arranged in a reactor<br>
chamber, which is horizontal,<br>
20     In fig. 8 it is shown how an insert comprising a block of units 1 moulded in<br>
one piece may be arranged in a reactor chamber. The reactor chamber<br>
surrounds a space in the shape of an elongated square. In the drawing,<br>
which. only shows a small section of the reactor chamber, there is shown<br>
line farmer wall 10 of the chamber and the side walls 11, 12. The front<br>
25     wall of the reactor chamber has been omitted for sake of clarity. In the<br>
drawing it is seen haw the fluid arrives from the right end of the chamber<br>
and flows in a serpentine path in the channel, which is defined by the<br>
units and the walls of the chamber. The cavity 9 formed between the<br>
insert and the side wall 12 makes it possible for the fluid to pass on to the<br>
30     adjacent lower row.<br><br>
9<br>
In fig. 9 there is shown an embodiment of a unit with slightly different form<br>
giving another kind of Insert. The unit 11 is seen from one side and has<br>
also upper and tower limits 31 and 41. In fig. 10 there is shown a cross,<br>
section of the unit 11 . As may be seen in the drawing the unit 11 has a<br>
5     plane surface 2' and a cylindrical part 51. There is a softly bended<br>
change-over from the cylindrical part to the plane part. The upper and<br>
lower limits 31 and 41 have the shape of a truncated triangle with two<br>
parallel sides. As may be seen in fig ,11 there is a space 6 in front of the<br>
cylindrical part 51 of the unit.<br>
10<br>
In fig. 12 there is seen how the units may be arranged in order to form a<br>
part of the insert intended to be used in the reactor chamber, every<br>
second unit being turned 180° in relation to the other unit. The part of<br>
the insert shown in fig. 12 may, as is shown in fig.13, be built up of<br>
15     columns 13, which are manufactured in one piece comprising a desired<br>
number of units.<br>
In fig. 14 there is shown a cross-section of a number of units I1 in a row.<br>
The plane surfaces 21 of the units are intended to abut on the walls of the<br>
20     reactor chamber in a tightening manner, in the drawing it is seen how the<br>
softly bended parts of the units 11 close to the plane surface 21 together<br>
with the cylindrical part of the units form a serpentine channel.<br>
In fig. 15 there is shown a perspective view of three rows of units with ten<br>
25     units in each, in this figure there is seen how the upper and lower limits of<br>
the units co-operate to form plane upper and lower surfaces which form<br>
the delimiting means separating the rows. It is also seen how the plane<br>
surfaces 21 form a plane area with small openings 14. The walls of the<br>
reaction chamber should abut on this plane area (surface) in a tightening<br><br>
10<br>
manner and form a limitation for the channel, which is obtained between<br>
the units.<br>
In fig, 16 the insert 15 iS shown within a reactor chamber 16. The reactor<br>
5     chamber is situated in a square-shaped opening in a rectangular plate 17.<br>
The reactor chamber is limited by the edges of the square-shaped<br>
opening and of thin plates or membranes situated behind and in front of<br>
the plate 17. (The thin plates or membranes are not shown in fig. 16.) At<br>
one end of the chamber there is an inlet 16 for the fluid, which shall pass<br>
10     the reactor chamber and at another end of the reactor chamber there is<br>
an outlet 19 for the fluid.<br>
A part of a reactor containing three reactor chambers 16 is shown in<br>
fig. 17. The walls 20, 21 surrounding the reactor chambers consist in this<br>
15     embodiment of thin plates of a heat conductive material. Membranes<br>
may, if so is suitable, be used instead of thin plates on one or both sides<br>
of the reactor chamber. At both sides of the reactor chamber there are<br>
channels 22 through which a cooling or heating fluid may flow. The<br>
channels 22 are on their other side delimited by walls 23. Between the<br>
20     channels for cooling or heating fluid are transition plates 24. The reaction<br>
chambers 16, the channels for cooling or heating rnedium and the<br>
transitions plates are surrounded on both sides by frame plates 25 and<br>
the package is held together by bolts 26. There is an inlet pipe 27 at one<br>
end of the reactor and a corresponding hole in the frame plates 25 and<br>
25     the walls surrounding the channels for cooling or heating medium. The<br>
fluid, which shall pass the reactor chamber, enters through the inlet pipe<br>
27 and the mentioned holes and arrives to the inlet 18 of the reactor<br>
chamber 16.<br><br>
11<br>
The fluid then flows in a serpentine path between the units in the first<br>
uppermost row, then through the next row and further on until all the rows<br>
in the first reaction chamber have been passed. The fluid then passes<br>
noles in the lower end of the reactor (not shown) and enters the second<br>
5     reactor chamber, in this the fluid is forced to flow from .one side of the<br>
reactor chamber to the other side between the units in row after row<br>
upwards until it reaches the row on the top. There is outlet 19 from the<br>
reactor chamber through which the fluid may pass on through the holes in<br>
the walls 21, 23 and through an opening 23 in the transition plate 24.<br>
10     In this embodiment the reactor chambers are connected In series.<br>
Of course it is also possible to connect the reactor chambers in parallel if<br>
so is desired.<br>
Instead of having heating or cooling channels on both sides of a reactor<br>
15     chamber it is also possible to separate two reactor chambers from each<br>
other by a membrane. With such an arrangement with a heating or<br>
cooling channel, a reactor chamber, a membrane, a reactor chamber and<br>
a heating or cooling channel arranged beside each other a first reaction<br>
may take place in the first reaction chamber and one component,<br>
20     originally present or formed during the reaction, may pass the membrane<br>
for a further reaction or heating or cooling.<br>
In the embodiments shown in the drawings all the units in an insert are of<br>
the same size and shape. Of course it is possible within the scope of the<br>
25     invention to use units of a smaller or thicker extension in one or a number<br>
of rows, or in only a part of a row. The upper or tower limits may be made<br>
thicker, which of course alters the size of the channel Such a reduction of<br>
the size of the channel may bring about an increase in the flow rate,<br>
which may be of advantage.<br>

5. Flow directing insert according to claims 1-4, characterized in<br>
that a connection between two adjacent rows of units (1/1) in the reactor<br>
chamber is obtained in that there is an opening (9) between one end of a<br>
row and a reactor side and also between the next row of units and the<br>
5     same reactor side, such that the fluid may flow from one row to the other<br>
in the created empty space.<br>
6. Flow directing insert according to claims 1-5, characterized in<br>
that at least two units (1,1) in at least two rows one adjacent the other<br>
10     are arranged such that an opening (7) in the cylindrical part of one unit is<br>
co-operating with an opening in the delimiting means (6) together with an<br>
opening (7) in the cylindrical part of the second unit gives a possibility to<br>
create passages between an intet at one end of the reactor chamber and<br>
a flow path anywhere in the reactor chamber or through said chamber.<br>
15<br>
7.  Flow directing insert according to claims 1-7, characterized in<br>
that a number of rows of units (1) and delimiting means (8) are produced<br>
in one piece.<br>
20     8.  Flow directing insert according to claims 1-7, characterized In<br>
that 3 number of units (11) and limits (3.4) are produced in one piece as a<br>
column.<br>
9,  Flow directing insert according to any of claims 1-8, characteri-<br>
25      zed in that the insert is manufactured in polyetheretherketone (PEEK),<br>
carbon, glass or metal.<br>
10. Reactor provided with at least one reactor chamber containing a flow<br>
directing insert according to any of the preceding claims.<br><br>
A flow directing insert for a reactor chamber in a reactor has a mainly<br>
square-shaped cross-section. The chamber has an inlet at one end of the<br>
5     chamber and an outlet at the other end of the chamber and at least one.<br>
of the walls of the reactor chamber consists of a hest conductive material<br>
or of a membrane. The insert comprises a number of units arranged in<br>
rows, which units together with the wails of the chamber define a channel<br>
for a fluid. The channel extends from a first side of the chamber to a<br>
10     second side of the chamber and back again to the first side backwards<br>
and forwards a number of  times. The units are arranged such that the<br>
fluid is forced to flow between the units in a serpentine path.<br>
A reactor comprises at least one reactor chamber containing a flow<br>
15     directing insert as described above.<br></td>
