				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to compositions, in either liquid or granular form, for use in laundry applications, wherein the compositions comprise certain cyclic amine based polymer, oligomer or copolymer materials in combination with hydrophobically modified carboxy methyl cellulose. This combination imparts appearance and integrity benefits to fabrics and textiles laundered in washing solutions formed from such compositions.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is, of course, well known that alternating cycles of using and laundering fabrics and textiles, such as articles of worn clothing and apparel, will inevitably adversely affect the appearance and integrity of the fabric and textile items so used and laundered. Fabrics and textiles simply wear out over time and with use. Laundering of fabrics and textiles is necessary to remove soils and stains which accumulate therein and thereon during ordinary use. However, the laundering operation itself, over many cycles, can accentuate and contribute to the deterioration of the integrity and the appearance of such fabrics and textiles.<br>
Deterioration of fabric integrity and appearance can manifest itself in several ways. Short fibers are dislodged from woven and knit fabric/textile structures by the mechanical action of laundering. These dislodged fibers may form lint, fuzz or "pills" which are visible on the surface of fabrics and diminish the appearance of newness of the fabric. Further, repeated laundering of fabrics and textiles, especially with bleach-containing laundry products, can remove dye from fabrics and textiles and impart a faded, worn out appearance as a result of diminished color intensity, and in many cases, as a result of changes in hues or shades of color.<br>
Given the foregoing, there is clearly an ongoing need to identify materials which could be added to laundry detergent products that would associate themselves with the fibers of the fabrics and textiles laundered using such detergent products and thereby reduce or minimize the tendency of the laundered fabric/textiles to deteriorate in appearance. Any such detergent product additive material should, of course, be able to benefit fabric appearance and integrity without unduly interfering with the ability of the laundry detergent to perform its fabric cleaning<br>
function. The present invention is directed to the use of a mixture of certain cyclic amine based polymer, oligomer or copolymer materials and hydrophobically modified carboxy methyl cellulose (CMC) in laundry applications that perform in this desired manner.<br>

In its method aspect, the present invention relates to the laundering or treating of fabrics<br>
and textiles in aqueous washing or treating solutions formed from effective amounts of the detergent comnositions described herein, or formed from the individual components of such compositions. Laundering of fabrics and textiles in such washing solutions, followed by nnsing and drying, imparts fabric appearance benefits to the fabric and textile articles so treated. Such benefits can include improved overall appearance, pill/fuzz reduction, antifadmg, improved abrasion resistance, and/or enhanced softness. It has been surprisingly determined that the a mixture of cyclic amine based polymers, oligomers or copolymers and hydrophobically modified cellulosic based polymers or oligomers according to this invention imparts fabric appearance and integrity benefits that are greater than the benefits achieved by a corresponding amount of either component by itself.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
As noted, when fabric or textiles are laundered in wash solutions which comprise the mixture of cyclic amine based polymers, oligomers or copolymers and hydrophobically modified cellulosic based polymers or oligomers of the present invention fabric appearance and integrity are enhanced. The mixture of cyclic amine based polymers, oligomers or copolymers and hydrophobically modified cellulosic based polymers or oligomers can be added to wash solutions by incorporating them into a detergent composition, a fabric softener or by adding them separately to the washing solution. The mixture of cyclic amine based polymers, oligomers or copolymers and hydrophobically modified cellulosic based polymers or oligomers are described herein primarily as liquid or granular detergent additives but the present invention is not meant to be so limited. The mixture of cyclic amine based polymers, oligomers or copolymers and hydrophobically modified cellulosic based polymers or oligomers, detergent composition components, optional ingredients for such compositions and methods of using such compositions, are described in detail below. All percentages are by weight unless other specified.<br>
A) Cyclic amine Based Polymer. Oligomer or Copolymer Materials<br>
An essential component of the compositions of the present invention comprises one or<br>
more cyclic amine based polymer, oligomer or copolymer.   Such materials have been found to<br>

solutions formed from detergent compositions which contain a mixture of cyclic amine based<br>
polymers, oligomers or copolymers and hydrophobically modified cellulosic based polymers or oligomers fabnc treatment matenals. Such fabric appearance benefits can include, for example, improved overall appearance of the laundered fabrics, reduction of the formation of pills and fuzz, protection against color fading, improved abrasion resistance, etc. The cyclic amine based fabnc treatment matenais used in the compositions and methods herein can provide such fabnc appearance benefits with acceptably little or no loss in cleaning performance provided by the laundry detergent compositions into which such materials are incorporated.<br>
The cyclic amine based polymer, oligomer or copolymer component of the compositions herein may comprise combinations of these cyclic amine based materials.

As will be apparent to those skilled in the art, an oligomer is a molecule consisting of only a few monomer units while polymers comprise considerably more monomer units. For the present invention, oligomers are defined as molecules having an average molecular weight below about 1,000 and polymers are molecules having an average molecular weight of greater than about 1,000.

More preferably, such cellulosic based fabric treatment materials will comprise from about 0.5% to about 4% by weight of the detergent compositions, most preferably from about 0.75% to about 3%. However, as discussed above, when used as a washing solution additive, i.e. when the cellulosic based fabric treatment component is not incorporated into a detergent composition, the<br>

The "Degree of Substitution" for group RC, which is sometimes abbreviated herein "DSRc", means the number of moles of group RC components, wherein Z is H or M, that are substituted per anhydrous glucose unit, wherein an anhydrous glucose unit is a six membered ring as shown in the repeating unit of the general structure above. The requirement that Z be H or M is necessary to insure that there are a sufficient number of carboxy methyl groups such that the resulting polymer is soluble. It is understood that in addition to the required number of RC components wherein Z is H or M, there can be, and most preferably are, additional RC components wherein Z is a group other than H or M.<br>

The term "cleaning-effective amount" refers to any amount capable of producing a cleaning, stain removal, soil removal, whitening, deodorizing, or freshness improving effect on  substrates such as  fabrics.     In practical  terms  for  current commercial preparations, typical amounts are up to about 5 mg by weight, more typically 0.01 mg to 3 mg, of active enzyme per gram of the detergent composition.   Stated otherwise, the compositions herein will typically comprise from 0.001% to 5%, preferably 0.01%-1% by weight of a commercial enzyme preparation.  Protease enzymes are usually present in such commercial preparations at levels sufficient to provide from 0.005 to 0.1 Anson units (AU) of activity per gram of composition.   Higher active levels may be desirable in highly concentrated detergent formulations.<br>
Cellulases usable herein include those disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,435,307, Barbesgoard et al., March 6, 1984, and GB-A-2.075.028; GB-A-2.095.275 and DE-OS-2.247.832. CAREZYME® and CELLUZYME® (Novo) are especially useful. See also WO 9117243 to Novo.<br>

Any polymer backbone can be used as long as the amine oxide polymer formed is water-soluble and has dye transfer inhibiting properties. Examples of suitable polymeric backbones are polyvinyls, polyalkylenes, polyesters, polyethers, polyamide, polyimides, polyacrylates and mixtures thereof. These polymers include random or block copolymers where one monomer type is an amine N-oxide and the other monomer type is an N-oxide. The amine N-oxide polymers typically have a ratio of amine to the amine N-oxide of 10:1 to 1:1,000,000. However, the number of amine oxide groups present in the polyamine oxide polymer can be varied by appropriate copolymerization or by an appropriate degree of N-oxidation. The polyasmine oxides can be obtained in almost any degree of polymerization.<br>
Typically, the average molecular weight is within the range of 500 to 1,000,000; more preferred 1,000 to 500,000; most preferred 5,000 to 100,000.<br>

The detergent compositions according to the present invention can be in liquid, paste or granular form. Such compositions can be prepared by combining the essential and optional components in the requisite concentrations in any suitable order and by any conventional means. The forgoing description of uses for the mixture of cyclic amine based polymers, oligomers or copolymers and hydrophobically modified cellulosic based polymers or oligomers defined herein are intended to be exemplary and other uses will be apparent to those skilled in the art and are intended to be within the scope of the present invention.<br>
Granular compositions, for example,  are generally made by combining base granule ingredients, e.g., surfactants, builders, water, etc., as a slurry, and spray drying the resulting slurry to a low level of residual moisture (5-12%). The remaining dry ingredients, e.g., granules of the  essential  mixture of cyclic  amine  based  polymers,  oligomers  or copolymers  and hydrophobically modified cellulosic based polymers or oligomers, can be admixed in granular powder form with the spray dried granules in a rotary mixing drum. The liquid ingredients, e.g., solutions of the essential mixture of cyclic amine based polymers, oligomers or copolymers and hydrophobically  modified  cellulosic  based  polymers  or  oligomers,  enzymes,  binders  and perfumes, can be sprayed onto the resulting granules to form the finished detergent composition. Granular compositions according to the present invention can also be in "compact form", i.e. they may have a relatively higher density than conventional granular detergents, i.e. from 550 to 950 g/1.   In such case, the granular detergent compositions according to the present invention will contain a lower amount of "inorganic filler salt", compared to conventional granular detergents; typical filler salts are alkaline earth metal salts of sulphates and chlorides, typically sodium sulphate; "compact" detergents typically comprise not more than 10% filler salt.<br>
Liquid detergent compositions can be prepared by admixing the essential and optional ingredients thereof in any desired order to provide compositions containing components in the requisite concentrations. Liquid compositions according to the present invention can also be in<br>
"compact form", in such case, the liquid detergent compositions according to the present invention will contain a lower amount of water, compared to conventional liquid detergents. Addition of the mixture of cyclic amine based polymers, oligomers or copolymers and hydrophobically modified cellulosic based polymers or oligomers to liquid detergent or other aqueous compositions of this invention may be accomplished by simply mixing into the liquid solutions the desired mixture of cyclic amme based polymers, oligomers or copolymers and hydrophobically modified cellulosic based polymers or oligomers.<br>
The methods and compositions heretofore disclosed may also be applied towards the production of particles that may be used as one of the component detergent granules in a granular detergent composition.<br>
G) Fabnc Laundenng Method<br>
The present invention also provides a method for laundering fabrics in a manner which imparts fabnc appearance benefits provided by the mixture of cyclic amine based polymers, oligomers or copolymers and hydrophobically modified cellulosic based polymers or oligomers used herein. Such a method employs contacting these fabrics with an aqueous washing solution formed from an effective amount of the detergent compositions hereinbefore described or formed from the individual components of such compositions. Contacting of fabrics with washing solution will generally occur under conditions of agitation although the compositions of the present invention may also be used to form aqueous unagitated soaking solutions for fabnc cleaning and treatment.<br>
Agitation is preferably provided in a washing machine for good cleaning. Washing is preferably followed by drying the wet fabnc in a conventional clothes dryer. An effective amount of a high density liquid or granular detergent composition in the aqueous wash solution in the washing machine is preferably from about 500 to about 7000 ppm, more preferably from about 1000 to about 3000 ppm.<br>
H) Fabric Conditioning and Softening<br>
The mixture of cyclic amine based polymers, oligomers or copolymers and hydrophobically modified cellulosic based polymers or oligomers hereinbefore described as components of the laundry detergent compositions herein may also be used to treat and condition fabrics and textiles in the absence of the surfactant and builder components of the detergent composition embodiments of this invention. Thus, for example, a fabric conditioning composition compnsing only the mixture of cyclic amine based polymers, oligomers or copolymers and hydrophobically modified cellulosic based polymers or oligomers themselves, or comprising an aqueous solution of the mixture of cyclic amine based polymers, oligomers or copolymers and hydrophobically modified cellulosic based polymers or oligomers, may be added during the rinse cycle of a conventional home laundering operation in order to impart the desired fabric appearance and ;ntegrity benefits hereinbefore described.<br>
