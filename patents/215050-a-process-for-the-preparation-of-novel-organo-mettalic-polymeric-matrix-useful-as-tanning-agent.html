				<td>reported by Schade et al (The Leather Manufacturer, p-11, July 1991) to be better compared to the phenol based systems for resisting discolouration of leather. But the major limitation associated with this type of syntan is the inadequate filling characteristics due to low molecular weights.<br>
Equi-molar quantities of urea and formaldehyde under favourable conditions give thermosetting type of resins. These resins loose their aqueous solubility when molecular weight is raised to 500 - 600 Daltons. Urea can also cross link with methylol compounds to give rise to carbamide linkages resulting in light fast syntans.<br>
The poor uptake of chromium in tanning has resulted in wide scale ecological concerns and economic loss. Chromium exhaustion can be improved by external exhaust aids based on long chain aliphatic dicarboxylates and aromatic polycarboxylates. But they not only require long tanning periods but also suffer from disadvantages of non-uniform distribution of chromium and difficulties in dyeing.<br>
Aluminium(lll) being a d째 metal does not enjoy ligand field stablisation advantages of d3 system like Cr(lll). Under proper ligating conditions and by proper manipulations of the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital - Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO-LUMO) energy gaps, Al(lll) can be made to behave like pseudo transitional metal. This is best possible with the use of hydroxy acids as ligating agents. Despite being transition metals, Ti(IV) and Zr(IV) are d째 systems. Proper ligation is the key to the use of these metal<br>
ions in tanning. Zirconium(IV) is often not used as solo tannages, partly because of its indifferent effectiveness at raising the shrinkage temperature and partly because of the acidity of the salts. The vulnerability to hydrolysis of Zr-salt has meant that they must be applied at high concentration and at pH 
There have been several reports on the use of sulphate salts of aluminium, zirconium and titanium in tanning. In 1907 Garelli (Journal of Society of Leather Technologists and Chemists, 42, 351, 1958) reported the use of zirconium in tanning. Sommerville reported the preparation of a 50% basic zirconyl sulphate corresponding to Zr(OH)2SO4 (Journal of Society of Leather Technologists and Chemists, 38, 347,1954). Somerville later on patented (US Patent No 1,940,610) in 1941 a basic salt approximating to Zr(H)2SO4.Na2SO4, which was reported to be an effective tanning agent and was then commercially available as Zircotan N. Ranganathan and Reed (Journal of Society of Leather Technologists and Chemists, 42, 59, 1958) reported that the addition of acetic, lactic, formic, sulphanilic and gluconic acids helped in sufficiently masking zirconium. Hans et ak(US Patent No US4049379) patented complex salts having zirconium and aluminium as central atoms and oxo, hyd/oxy organic acids and sulphate ligands. Max (US<br>
Patent No US 3953163) and Alain et al (US Patent No US5264000) reported the use of arylsulphones and lithium salts and ethylenediaminetetraacetic<br>
acid as complexing agents for zirconium. Alain(US Patent No US 48306212% reported that aqueous compositions of sulphonated phenols, amines and metal (zirconium, aluminium, chromium and iron) could be used in tanning. Richard patented (US Patent No US 3966902)) polymeric complexes containing a monomer, metal ion, hydrophilic functional groups like hydroxyl, carboxyl or amino groups for using as tanning agents.<br>
Though many products based on metal ions like chromium, aluminium, titanium, zirconium and iron have been reported, they lack the ability to withstand pH conditions of above 5.5 as described by Prof E Heidemann(Fundamentals of Leather Manufacture, Chapter 11, Eduard Roether KG publications 1st edition, 1993). Further when white/pastel shades are needed, phenolic compounds need be avoided to prevent discolouration. When any metal ion is discharged into the environment in large quantities, it generates great ecological concerns and hence the tanning agents need to have an active ingredient which could give near zero wastage of the metal salt.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of novel organo-metallic polymeric matrix for industrial applications, which obviates the drawbacks stated above.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to exploit the charge transfer interaction between the metal ion and various organic ligands capable of<br>
having charge transfer interactions with the metal ion, thus enabling the reduction of HOMO-LUMO gap and reducing the lability of the metal-ligand bond.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to develop organo-metallic polymeric matrix which, when used in tanning, would resist discolouration of leather on ageing.<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to develop an organo-metallic polymeric matrix which resists precipitation of metal ion above pH value of 5.5.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to develop a product which when used in tanning gives an exhaustion of more than 95% of the metal salt employed.<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to provide novel organo-metallic polymeric matrix for industrial applications, particularly in tanning industry.<br>
Accordingly the  present invention  provides     a  process  for the preparation of novel organo-metallic polymeric matrix useful as tanning agent, which comprises i)        sulphonating   an   aromatic   hydrocarbon,   preferably   naphthalene,<br>
anthraxcene, at 110 - 180째C for 1 - 3 hrs in conventional way,<br>
wherein the amount of sulphuric acid used for sulphonation is 3 - 5<br>
moles per mole of the aromatic hydrocarbon,<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of novel organo metallic polymeric matrix useful as tanning agent. This matrix has potential use particularly as a self-tanning as well as a retanning agent for leather processing in tanning industry.<br>
Conventional chrome tanning practices lack adequate filling of leather and give rise to an uptake of 50 - 60% of chromium offered. For providing filling action synthetic tanning agents (syntans) are used. The conventional syntans, hitherto known, are mostly anionic in nature and are usually derived from sulphonated phenols and other aromatic compounds. As reported by Prof. S.S. Dutta (Principles of Leather Manufacture, Chapter 10, ILTA publication, 3rd. edition, 1985), the first syntan was prepared by Stiasny by condensing phenol/cresol sulphonic acid with formaldehyde and later the Novolac type of syntan was prepared by sulphonating the condensed product of unsulphonated phenol/cresol and formaldehyde. The molecular weights of these syntans can be suitably adjusted by adduct formation. Gunther et al (US Patent No US 432 5890) and Albert et al (US Patent No US 400 0996) observed adequate filling in retanning of leather by using phenol - formaldehyde and phenol - sulphonic acid - urea formaldehyde condensates respectively . Kanthimathi et al ( Leather Science, 32/(3), 59, 1985) reported that photo- oxidation of phenolic constituents leading to discolouration of leather and poorer uptake of anionic dyes are some to the associated demerits of such products . Naphthalene sulphonic acid systems have been<br>
ii) adding organic ligand such as herein defined, to the mixture as formed in step (i), at 40 - 60째C, wherein the amount of organic ligand used is 0.1-10 moles per mole of the aromatic hydrocarbon,<br>
iii)       treating the reaction mixture, as formed either in step (i) and (ii), with  A2<br>
formaldehyde at 45 - 70째C over a period of 20 - 40 min, iv)       condensing the reaction mixture, as formed in step (iii), with a water<br>
  Compmising urea and formaldehyde at ratio (:) at 45 - 70째C for a period of 20-60 min,<br>
v)        complexing the condensate, as formed in step (iv) with organic ligand<br>
and a metal salt as described herein, at a temperature in the range of<br>
50 - 95째C, for a period of 1 - 5 hrs, vi)       neutralizing the reaction mixture by known method to pH 2 - 4 at 30 -<br>
50째C, vii)      drying the filtrate of the reaction mixture, as formed in step (vi), by<br>
known method for 3-60 sec at a temperature in the range of 130-<br>
260째C to get novel organo-metallic polymeric matix.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the aromatic hydrocarbon used may be such as naphthalene, anthracene.<br>

In still another embodiment of the present invention, the molecular weight of the water-soluble adduct may be in the range of 500 to2000 Daltons.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, pH of the water-soluble adduct may be in the range of 3 to 6.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the metal used for anchoring to the organic polymeric matrix may be such as zirconium, titanium, iron, aluminium, chromium.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the salt of the metal may be in the form such as sulphate, chloride, oxychloride either individually or in combination.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the amount of metal salt used may be 2-10 moles per mole of the aromatic hydrocarbon.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides novel organo-metallic polymeric matrix prepared by the process described above.<br>
An aromatic hydrocarbon is sulphonated using sulphuric acid at a molar ratio ranging from 1:3 to 1:5 over a period of 1-3 hrs at a temperature in the range of 110-180째 C. Conventional masking agent, calculated as 0.1-0.4 mole per mole of the aromatic hydrocarbon is added as an optional step at 40-60째C to the reaction mixture, which is then treated with formaldehyde amounting maximum to a molar ratio of 1:1 with respect to the aromatic hydrocarbon at a temperature range of 45-70째 C over a period of 20-40 min.<br>
0.5- 2% w/v, of Urea - formaldehyde adduct of molecular weight in the range of 500 to 2000 Daltons, prepared separately by a conventional method using urea and formaldehyde in a molar ratio of maximum 1:1, is condensed with the above mass at45-70째C for a period of 20-60 min.<br>
0.5-10 moles of complex forming agent per mole of the aromatic hydrocarbon is then added to the condensate, which is treated with a metal salt calculated as 1:2 to 1:10 in terms of molar ratio based on the moles of aromatic hydrocarbon used The reaction is continued for 1-5 hrs at a temperature in the range of 50-95째 C.<br>
The reaction mixture is then cooled to a temperature of 30-50째C and the pH is adjusted in the range of 2.0-4.0 by known method.<br>
The resulting reaction mixture is filtered in a conventional way and the final slurry is dried by known method for 3-60 sec at a temperature in the range of 130-260째C.<br>
The novelty of the present invention lies in selecting the starting material and in providing a process to prepare an organic polymeric matrix with ligating sites capable of anchoring metal ion, thereby forming a complex organo-metallic polymeric matrix , which is, unlike the conventional tanning/retanning agents, resistant to precipitation upto a much higher pH value of 10, facilitating higher neutralisation during the post tanning operation in leather processing.<br>
