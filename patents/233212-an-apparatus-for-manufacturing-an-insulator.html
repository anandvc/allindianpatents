				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to an apparatus for manufacturing an insulator and more particularly to an apparatus for use with the method for manufacturing an electrical insulator.<br>
Today, there are a number of different methods for manufacturing an electrical insulator for high voltages. The majority of these electrical insulators are today made in porcelain. One alternative to porcelain can be a hollow insulator that consists of a tube, preferably made of a composite material, an attachment flange at each end of the insulator and, as outer insulation, a coating, commonly of silicone rubber. Another electrical insulator can comprise a solid rod with an added outer insulation, commonly silicon rubber. In the text below, the terms tube/rod are designated body.<br>
It is known that to manufacture an electrical insulator of the type described above, a silicon coating in the form of an inverted T-shaped-profile is wound in a screw-like fashion around a ready-made body. The coating is wound from one end of the body in a screw-like fashion so that one edge of the T-shaped profile comes to lie against the other edge of the T-shaped profile on the next turning. One problem with the known insulator is that of achieving a tight fit when attaching the inverted T-shaped profile against the body, especially with regard to the tightness between the joints of adjacent turns of the finished profile. One way of trying to solve these problems is describing in FR-A1-2 726 684, which describes a method for manufacturing such an electrical insulator. In this case, the silicon rubber material is extruded from a nozzle at a distance from the body and is thereafter wound around the body. The profile is shaped so that the edges of the lips of the T-shaped profile are beveled, so that when correctly wound, the edge of the profile of the subsequent turns lies inwards over the adjacent edge of the previous turn. A pressing tool then presses together the joints between each of the following winding turns to achieve sufficient tightness between the joints.<br>
In spite of the intended improvements with the method according to the French patent application named above, the risk that insulating problems could arise at the joints of adjacent windings still remains, and in the final analysis, these can cause the insulant to lose its insulating properties. One problem that can arise is that the silicone does not extend all the way up against the flange, which can give rise to partial discharges at the flange and that can then cause an electrical flash-over. Another problem with previous techniques is that one could get trapped air between the wound profile and the body. Moisture can force its way into these air pockets, which can lead to the insulator loosing its insulating ability.<br><br>
According to the known method for the manufacture of a spirally wound insulator the silicone rubber profile is extruded in a linear line at a distance from the body, after which it is wound around the body.<br>
When the profile is wound around the body, the outermost radial sections are exposed to stretching. This stretching can result in part in tension remaining in the material, and in part in deformities in the profile during winding.<br>
The objective of the present invention is to achieve a new method that, by means of a simple manufacturing process, achieves an insulator including a body, with a  very homogeneous and reliable exterior coating of the body, yet that is nevertheless very cost-efficient.<br>
Another objective is to achieve a method that eliminates cavities and trapped air between the applied material and the body, as well as at possible flanges at the ends of the body.<br>
A further objective of the invention is to achieve an apparatus for manufacturing an insulator in accordance with the method according to the invention.<br>
As such, the method according to the invention includes the manufacture of an electrical insulator including a body and a coating of insulating material arranged on the body, whereby the coating is applied to the body in a screw-like or helical-like fashion where the coating is molded by extrusion directly at the body. Thus, a good adhesion bond is obtained with the outer surface of the body, and, additionally, a homogeneous joint with the adjacent turn is also obtained. In this way, a very homogenous coating with good adherence to the body is achieved. This method prevents the occurrence of trapped air pockets.<br>
The invention even includes an apparatus for manufacturing an insulator that includes a nozzle for extruding an insulating material to be applied onto a body, and an apparatus for displacing the mutual positions of the nozzle and the body, and where the body is arranged to form an additional complementary part to the extrusion nozzle.<br><br>
Accordingly, there is provided a method for manufacturing an electrical insulator including a body and a coating of insulating material arranged on the body whereby the coating is applied onto the body in a screw-like form or a helical-like form, characterised in that the coating is moulded directly on the body by extrusion.<br>
Accordingly, there is also provided an apparatus for manufacturing an insulator comprising a nozzle for extruding an insulating material for application to a body and a device for the mutual displacement of the body and nozzle wherein the body is arranged to form a complementary part of the extrusion nozzle.<br>
The invention will now be described in greater detail in the form of a non-limiting embodiment example illustrated with the help of the enclosed drawings, where fig. 1 schematically show a cross-section through a body in the form of a tube, and an equivalent longitudinal cross-section through part of a nozzle for extruding a profile of insulating material at the position of the nozzle for applying this onto the tube, fig.2 shows schematically an end view of the nozzle, seen from the left in fig. 1, showing the application of the profile of insulating material onto the tube, fig. 3 shows schematically a<br><br>
perspective view of an apparatus according to the invention including a device for rotating the tube during the application of the profile of insulating material:, and fig. 4 shows schematically a section cut through a pan of an electrical insulator.<br>
Fig. 1 thus shows a cross-section through a body 1 in the form of a rube, preferably made of a polymer material, particularly a cross-linked hardened plastic or a rubber mixture. The body 1 is supported on a stand (not shown) and Can be rotated around this stand. The rotation of the body 1 is suitably achieved with a ball and socket screw, pulley or similar, that is nevertheless described in more detail below in connection with fig. 3. When rotated by a ball and socket screw, the body can be displaced in its longitudinal direction and in relation to an extrusion machine.<br>
Fig. 1 also shows the front end of an extrusion nozzle 2 that is connected to an extrusion machine (not shown). The extrusion machine can be any suitable known type. The lower end of the nozzle is cut off to form a cut-away section 3 that can be cup-shaped or at an inclined plane at an angle to the longitudinal extension of the nozzle 2, and similarly to the direction for feeding the material through the nozzle, whereby the cut-away section has a radius that essentially matches the radius of the body 1 against which the nozzle 2 will be used. To obtain the intended thickness of the layer of insulation on the body, the nozzle is essentially positioned at a distance from the surface of the body 1 that is the same as the intended thickness of this layer, probably less that 20 mm from this and preferably less than 7 mm, and it is significant for the invention that ihe extruded material can be applied to the body 1 with a pressure for achieving a good adhesion to it. In addition, nozzle 2 has, as is evident from fig. 2, an opening 4 in the direction of the feed, that essentially has the shape of an inverted T to form the desired profile on the material that is extruded through the nozzle. The extruded material can nevertheless also have other shapes, such as, for example, a flat coating without a projecting profile or a profile with two or more projecting sheds, where the sheds can be arranged with different heights in relation to each other.<br>
When material is extruded through nozzle 2, the body 1 is rotated, as will be described in greater detail in connection with fig. 3, and, with the help of the ball and socket screw, a displacement of the body in an axial direction can take place, so that during one complete rotation, the body 1 is displaced in an axial direction a distance that is equivalent to the width of the extruding insulating material S at its bottom 5a, i.e. that part that lies against the  surface of the body 1. Fig. 2 suggests the appearance of the profile 5 of a preceding turn and shows the nozzle in the end view, It is thus evident that nozzle 2 does<br><br>
not just have a cup-shaped cut-away section 3 in its lower part, but thai; it also has a section open in the axial direction of the body, namely in the direction that faces against the material already applied in an earlier turn. As is evident from fig. 2. the nozzle has a profile visible on the left-hand side of the drawing seen in the figure that forms a limitation 6 for the left-hand lip of the inverted T-shaped profile, and that extends in against the contact with the body 1. This open section is also found in the right-hand part of the figure and where the lower surface 7, also called open side section,of the nozzle extends further out than the newly extruded part of this lip of the T-shaped profile is intended to do in order to lie up against the upper pan of the already extruded inverted T-sliaped profile of the previous turn. During extrusion, the material thus has the possibility to flow out or float out along the body and come in contact with the insulating material already applied during the previous turn. Thanks to, among other things, the pressure that is formed in the gap between the body 1 and the extruding nozzle 2, a very homogeneous coating is achieved, whereby screw-formed or helical-formed moulding that is free of joints is obtained. To restrict the area for the flow of the extruded material out along the body, the profile of the nozzle that is located to the left in the figure can have an adjustable blade (not shown) that can be displaced radially against the body for essentially coming in contact with the body and comprising a second outer limitation of the possibility of the material to flow out along the surface of the body. As is suggested in the figure, the nozzle 2 is also cut off at the side 8 on the right so as not to affect the projecting pan of the profile 5 on the previously applied rum.<br>
As mentioned above, nozzle 2 is designed with a cut-away section to connect closely with the body 1 at which the nozzle is to be used. Preferably the nozzle 2 is provided with an open side section 7 against a layer of the insulating material that has been previously applied onto the body 1 so that when it is extruded, the applied layer forms a complementary part to the extrusion nozzle. A closing-off device can be arranged in the nozzle to control the flow in the different parts of the nozzle. In this way, a larger flow can, for example, be arranged in the outer radius of the nozzle. An insulater with a small radius can thus be produced without deformities and without the occurrence of internal tension. The height of the profile can be greater than the diameter of the bady. For example, a relation between profile height and body diameter of up to 5:1  can be achieved on an insulator. The nozzle can also be provided with heating or cooling devices to allow the possibility of adapting the viscosity of the extruded material to the deiiired flow properties.<br><br>
Several extrusion machines can also be coupled to the nozzle to allow, for example, the core of the applied material to be in one material and the outer layer in another material.<br>
Fig. 3 shows schematically the apparatus for rotating and displacing the body 1 during the application of the outer coating. The body 1 is supported on a moveable carrier that is suggested schematically. The body 1 is joined to a ball nut miming along a ball screw for supporting the body. A linear unit is arranged parallel with the ball screw and body, on which a driving device including, for example a motor and gearing (not shown) can be displaced parallel with the ball screw and together with the body I. The motor drives the gearing whose projecting axle 9 is fitted with a toothed belt wheel 10 that drives a transmission belt 11 that in turn drives an equivalent toothed belt w'fieel 12 joined to the supporting device for the body 1, so that when the motor rotates, it can, with the help of the transmission belt, rotate the body and, at the same time, even accomplish the axial displacement of not only the body 1 but also the driving unit. The driving unit can be joined with the body's stand via a carrier to achieve displacement together with this.<br>
To change the pitch of the screw or helical moulding of the profile on the body, it is sufficient to exchange the toothed belt wheels 10, 12 on the gearing and/or the supporting device of the body, or alternatively, change the pitch of the ball screw. In this way, changing the pitch is relatively easy to accomplish.<br>
The costing is suitably extruded onto the body 1 during: the mutual rotation and transverse displacement between the body 1 and the extrusion nozzle 2. It is not necessary that the tody 1 rotates while the extrusion nozzle 2 remains stationary, In certain cases, it can be more appropriate to design the apparatus so that it is the extrusion nozzle 2 that rotates around a stationary body, or one that is possibly moving in its longitudinal direction only.<br>
It can even be considered unnecessary that any direct drive for rotating the body 1 is needed, even in those cases where the body is to be rotated, as the rotation of the body could even be accomplished by the force of reaction from the extruded material.<br>
The extrusion nozzle 2, and suitably even the whole or part of the extrusion device, are suitably supported on an adjustable manipulator such as, for example, a robot arm, so that it can easily be set-up in relation to the body. If the body does not have a constant thickness  it is especially advantageous if the nozzle can  be set-up in relation to the body not only in regards to distance but also to the angle of inclination<br>
Although the drawings only show the body and the parts that interact with it in an essentially horizontal position, the body can, according to the invention, also be<br><br>
suitable to arrange standing in an essentially vertical position with tbe interacting parts modified accordingly.<br>
Fig. 4 shows part of a helical profile 5 that has been wound in position, where the dielectric conductor, for example, an optical conductor 13 such as an optical fibre, runs on the inside of the applied coating material, for the transport of energy. During the application of the method according to the invention, it is very easy to embed such a dielectric conductor in the coating material. Prior to the extrusion, this dielectric conductor is applied in a screw-like fashion around the outside of the tube, and when the extrusion takes place directly and under pressure on the surface of the tube, the dielectric conductor is embedded in the coating material as this flows around it. The dielectric conductor can without problem be wound in a screw-like fashion on the body 1 with any chosen pitch.<br>
As the extrusion of the material takes place directly against the rotating body under a pressure between the nozzle and the body, a good spreading-out or flow of the material is achieved, which gives good adhesion and also eliminates cavities and trapped pockets of air between the material and the body. In this description, the use of the term "moulded" against the body, is intended to mean that it is applied to and formed on the body. To maintain the correct viscosity of the extruded material at the moment it comes into contact with the body, it can be appropriate for the nozzle to be heatable to adjust the temperature of the extruded material. Thus, the nozzle mav include a device for adjusting the temperature of the extruded material. The main advantage of the method according to the invention is that the coating and the possible profile can be formed while they are still soft, which gives good adhesive properties and an homogeneous coating,<br>
In the invention above, the body has been described as being composed of a composite material, but it is possible to use other types of bodies in insulating materials. Such material be in the form o£ for example, thermoplastic bodies, ceramic bodies, or combinations of these or other types of bodies. The bodies can be mute of a rod shape, a tube, hollow bodies or bodies with a variable geometric shape, such as a truncated cone, etc. The nozzle can be arranged so that it is continuously directable on the body.<br>
The description has mainly stated that the material suitable to extrude and be used to form the screw or helically moulded coating should be of silicone rubber, but even other insulating materials with similar properties can naturally also be considered, e.g. thermoplastics, EFDM or a ceramic. A silicone rubber material used can, for example, include aluminium trihydrate as a filler to give improved creeping distance and altered viscosity.<br><br>
Similarly, it is described above that it is the body and the driving unit that are displaced during the screw or helical moulding of the body, but it is also possible to instead allow the extrusion machine to be the part that moves, in which case, the extrusion machine is connected by some suitable means to the ball screw or a suitable manipulator, so that when the body is being rotated, it brings about a mutual displacement between the body and the extrusion nozzle, which is the essential aspect for accomplishing a screw or helical silicons rubber profile on the body.<br>
Following the manufacture of an insulator according to the method described above, the insulator can be hardened or vulcanised, which can, for example, occur during heat treatment for 51 hours at 130°C.<br>
With the method according to the invention, a coating can be moulded onto bodies with very small diameters, for example, down to as little as about 20 mm diameter, which makes the method applicable for manufacturing a diverse range of different types of insulator.<br>
The present invention also includes an apparatus for performing the said method for manufacturing an insulator, including a nozzle for the extrusion of an insulating material to be applied on to a body, and an apparatus for mutually displacing the body and the nozzle between one another, and where the body is designed to form a complementary part to the extrusion nozzle.<br>
