THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED:-<br><br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[001] The present invention relates to methods of treating central nervous system (CNS) disorders using (lR,4S)-trans 4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-l,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1 -napthalenamine; (\S,4R)-trans 4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1 -napthalenamine and the four isomers of JV-[4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-l,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalen-1-yl] formamide.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
[002] Clinicians recognize a distinction among central nervous system illnesses, and there have been many schemes for categorizing mental disorders. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Ed, Text Revision, (hereinafter, the "DSM-IV-TR™"), published by the American Psychiatric Association, and incorporated herein by reference, provides a standard diagnostic system upon which persons of skill rely. According to the framework of the DSM-IV-TR™, the CNS disorders of Axis I include: disorders diagnosed in childhood (such as, for example, attention deficit disorder or "ADD" and attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder or "ADHD") and disorders diagnosed in adulthood. CNS disorders diagnosed in adulthood include (1) schizophrenia and psychotic disorders; (2) cognitive disorders; (3) mood disorders; (4) anxiety related disorders; (5) eating disorders; (6) substance related disorders; (7) personality disorders; and (8) "disorders not yet included" in the scheme.<br>
[003] Of particular interest to the present invention are adulthood disorders of DSM-IV-TR™ categories (1) through (7) and sexual disorders, currently classified in category (8). Mood disorders of particular interest include depression, seasonal affective disorder and bipolar disorder. Anxiety related<br><br>
disorders of particular interest are agoraphobia, generalized anxiety disorder, phobic anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), panic disorder, acute stress disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, premenstrual syndrome, social phobia, chronic fatigue disorder, perimenopause, menopause and male menopause.<br>
[004] In general, treatment for psychoses, such as schizophrenia, for example, is quite different than treatment for mood disorders. While psychoses are treated with D2 antagonists such as olanzapine (the "typical" and "atypical" antipsychotics), mood disorders are treated with drugs that inhibit the neuronal reuptake of monoamines, in particular, serotonin (5-HT), norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA).<br>
[00S] Common therapeutic agents for mood disorders include, but are not limited to, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI's), including fluoxetine, citalopram, nefazodone, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, and sertraline.<br>
[006] Sertraline, whose chemical name (lS,4S)-c/s 4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-N-methyl-l-napthalenamine, is approved for the treatment of depression by the United States Food and Drug Administration, and is available under the trade name ZOLOFT® (Pfizer Inc., NY, NY, USA). In the human subject, sertraline has been shown to be metabolized to (lS,4S)-c/s 4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-l,2,3,4-tetrahydro-l-napthalenamine, also known as desmethylsertraline or norsertraline. Desmethylsertraline has been described as "not contributing significantly to the serotonergic action of sertraline" Ronfield et al., Clinical Pharmacokinetcs, 32:22-30 (1997). Reports from Hamelin et al., Clinical Pharmacology &amp; Therapeutics, 60:512 (1996) and Serebruany et al., Pharmacological Research, 43:453-461 (2001), have stated that norsertraline is "neurologically inactive".    These statements appear to be<br><br>
based on results observed in serotonin-induced syndrome and ptosis in mouse models in vivo, whereas the original Pfizer research papers suggested on the basis of data in vitro that desmethylsertraline was a selective serotonin uptake inhibitor. Koe et al, JPET, 226:686-700 (1983). Sanchez et al, Cellular and Molecular Neurobiology, 19: 467 (1999), speculated that despite its lower potency, desmethylsertraline might play a role in the therapeutic effects of sertraline but, there is presently no evidence in the literature to support this theory.<br>
[007] The primary clinical use of sertraline is in the treatment of depression. In addition, United States Patent 4,981,870 discloses and claims the use of sertraline and norsertraline, as well as (\R,4S)-trans 4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-N-methyl-l-napthalenamine and (\S,4R)-trans 4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-l,2,3,4-tetrahydro-N-methyl-l-napthalenamine for the treatment of psychoses, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis and inflammation. The receptor pharmacology of the individual (\S,4R) and (\R,4S) enantiomers of trans 4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-l,2,3,4-tetrahydro-N-methyl-l-napthalenamine is described by Welch etal, J. Med Chem., 27:1508-1515 (1984).<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
[008] It has now been discovered that (lR,4S)-trans 4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-l-napthalenamine ~(P) and (\S,4R)-trans 4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-l,2,3,4-tetrahydro-l-napthalenamine (Q) are useful in the treatment of CNS-related disorders that are modulated by monoamine activity, and produce diminished side effects as compared to the current standards of treatment. Treatable CNS disorders include, but are not limited to, mood disorders (e.g., depression), anxiety disorders (e.g., OCD), behavioral disorders (e.g., ADD and ADHD), eating disorders, substance abuse disorders and sexual<br><br>
function disorders. The compounds are also useful for the prophylaxis of migraine.<br>
10091   Compounds P and O are represented by the formulae:<br><br><br><br><br>
[0010] In one aspect, the present invention relates to a method for treating CNS<br>
disorders, which involves the administration of a therapeutically effective amount of P or Q, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of either. [0011] In another aspect, the invention relates to trans- 4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-l-napthalenamine of the formula (PQ):<br><br>
[0012] In another aspect, the invention relates to a process for preparing 4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-l,2,3,4-tetrahydro-l-napthalenamine, which involves:<br>
(a) reacting 4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3,4-dihydro-l-naphthalenone with an excess of formic acid and formamide to provide N-[4-(3,4-dichloro phenyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalen-1 -yl]formamide; and<br><br>
(b) hydrolyzing	the	N-[4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-l,2,3,4-tetrahydro<br>
naphthalen-l-yl]formamide with aqueous acid, and thereby yielding 4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1 -napthalenamine.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
[0013] The present invention provides several embodiments of a method for treating one or more CNS disorders. The method encompasses administering pure P or pure Q, or any mixture thereof. Administration of either compound or any combination thereof, including the racemic mixture of trans isomers, results in a broad therapeutic profile and avoidance of side effects that are associated with an imbalance among the distribution of activity between norepinephrine, serotonin and dopamine receptors.<br>
[0014] Preparation of compounds of the present invention is illustrated below in Scheme 1 and its accompanying narrative.<br><br>
Scheme 1<br><br><br><br>
[0015] In the compound<br><br>
C|	of Scheme 1,<br><br>
^R 3<br>
R is       R , wherein R , R and R3 are each independently alkyl.   In a preferred embodiment of the compounds, R is tert-butyl.<br><br>
[0016] N-[4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalen-1 -yl]formamide, the  intermediate  in  the   synthesis   shown  in   Scheme   1,   exists  in  four stereoisomeric forms:<br><br>
NHCHO	NHCHO<br><br>
[0017] When	A44KM^cMorophenyl)-l,2,3,4-tefrahydronaphthalen-l-<br>
yl]formamide is synthesized from achiral starting materials via non-stereoselective syntheses, all four isomers will be produced. The mixture can be readily separated into a racemic cis diastereomer and a racemic trans diastereomer by means, such as recrystallization or chromatography on achiral media, that rely on chemical and physical differences.<br>
[0018] The trans diastereomer, represented as E below, is a 1:1 mixture of A and B. When E is hydrolyzed, PQ is produced; when A is hydrolyzed, P is produced; when B is hydrolyzed, Q is produced. The cis diastereomer, represented as F below, is a 1:1 mix of C and D.<br><br>
[0019] The graphic representations of racemic, ambiscalemic and scalemic or enantiomerically pure compounds used herein are taken from Maehr, J^Chem, Ed., 62:114-120 (1985): solid and broken wedges are used to denote the absolute configuration of a chiral element; wavy lines indicate disavowal of any stereochemical implication which the bond it represents could generate; solid and broken bold lines are geometric descriptors indicating the relative configuration shown but not implying any absolute stereochemistry; and wedge outlines and dotted or broken lines denote enantiomerically pure compounds of indeterminate absolute configuration.<br><br>
[0020] Thus, formula PQ above indicates any mbcture of the individual isomers P and Q, which share the trans relative configuration. Clearly, the most convenient mixture is the 1:1 racemate. When a single enantiomer is to be employed, it is preferred that the mixture include greater than 90% of the desired enantiomer, more preferably greater than 95%, and most preferably, greater than 98%. The percentages refer to the optical purity of the single enantiomer.<br>
[0021] According to the present invention a therapeutically effective amount of A^-[4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-l,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthide«-l-yl]formarnide, which may be a pure isomer or a mixture of any or all of A, B, C and D, may also be administered to a person a need of therapy<br>
[0022] Disorders treatable with the compounds of the present invention include, but are not limited to: depression, bipolar disorder, chronic fatigue disorder, seasonal affective disorder, agoraphobia, generalized anxiety disorder, phobic anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), panic disorder, acute stress disorder, social phobia, posttraumatic stress disorder, premenstrual syndrome, menopause, perimenopause and male menopause.<br>
[0023] Depression, for example, is characterized by changes in mood, and by feelings of intense sadness or pessimistic worry. Symptoms include insomnia, anorexia, CNS slowing, as well as a loss of drive, enthusiasm, and libido.<br>
[0024] Studies have shown that an increase in body monoamine levels, especially an increase in the level of norepinephrine, appears to reduce the symptoms associated with the aforementioned disorders. Thus, the compounds of the present invention are believed to provide their therapeutic activity by simultaneously blocking the reuptake of norepinephrine, serotonin and dopamine.<br><br>
[0025] In addition to their beneficial therapeutic effects, compounds of the present invention provide the additional benefit of avoiding one or more of the adverse effects associated with conventional mood disorder treatments. Such side effects include, for example, insomnia, breast pain, weight gain, extrapyramidal symptoms, elevated serum prolactin levels and sexual dysfunction (including decreased libido, ejaculatory dysfunction and anorgasmia).<br>
[0026] The compounds of the present invention are also effective for treating disruptive behavior disorders, such as attention deficit disorder (ADD) and attention deficit disorder / hyperactivity (ADHD), which is in accordance with its accepted meaning in the art, as provided in the DSM-IV-TR™. These disorders are defined as affecting one's behavior resulting in inappropriate actions in learning and social situations. Although most commonly occurring during childhood, disruptive behavior disorders may also occur in adulthood.<br>
[0027] The term ADD, as used herein, includes both attention deficit disorder and attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and is used in accordance with its accepted meaning in the art, which is defined in the DSM-IV-TR™. Accordingly, as used herein, the term attention deficit disorder includes ADHD: DSM-IV-TR™ categories 314.xx (which includes 314.01, 314.00 and 314.9); conduct disorder: DSM-IV-TR™ categories 312.xx (which includes 312.81, 312.82 and 312.89, as well as 312.9 - disruptive behavior disorder); and oppositional defiant disorder: DSM-IV-TR™ category 313.81. The skilled artisan will recognize that there are alternate nomenclatures, nosologies, and classification systems for pathological conditions and that these systems evolve with medical scientific progress.<br><br>
[0028] Methylphenidate (RITALIN®; Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, East Hanover, NJ, USA) is typically the drug of choice for the treatment and/or prevention of ADD. Tricyclic antidepressants (such as, for example, imipramine), caffeine, dextroamphetamine, and other psychostimulants (such as, for example, pemoline) are less preferred alternatives to methylphenidate. Common side effects of methylphenidate include sleep disturbances, depression or sadness, headache, stomachache, suppression of appetite, elevated blood pressure, and, with large continuous doses, a reduction of growth. Accordingly, alternate means of treating or preventing attention deficit disorders would be of great benefit. Due to their strong dopaminergic component, compounds of the present invention not only provide effective treatment of disruptive behavior disorders, but also, avoid many of the adverse effects associated with conventional treatments.<br>
[0029] The term "treating" when used in connection with the foregoing disorders means amelioration, prevention or relief from the symptoms and / or effects associated with these disorders and includes the prophylactic administration of a compound of formula P or Q, a mixture thereof, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of either, to substantially diminish the likelihood or seriousness of the condition.<br>
[0030] Compounds of the present invention are also effective for treating eating disorders. Eating disorders are defined as a disorder of one's appetite or eating habits or of inappropriate somatotype visualization. Eating disorders include, but are not limited to, anorexia nervosa; bulimia nervosa, obesity and cachexia.<br>
[6031] Compounds of the invention are also effective for treating cerebral function disorders. The term cerebral function disorder, as used herein, includes cerebral function disorders involving intellectual deficits, and may be<br><br>
exemplified by senile dementia, Alzheimer's type dementia, memory loss, amnesia / amnestic syndrome, epilepsy, disturbances of consciousness, coma, lowering of attention, speech disorders, Parkinson's disease and autism.<br>
[0032] The compounds of formulae P and Q are also effective for treating sexual dysfunction in both males and females. Disorders of this type include, for example, erectile dysfunction and orgasmic dysfunction related to clitoral disturbances.<br>
Compounds of the present invention are also useful in the treatment of substance abuse, including for example addiction to cocaine, heroin, nicotine, alcohol, anxiolytic and hypnotic drugs, cannabis (marijuana), amphetamines, hallucinogens, phenylcyclidine, volatile solvents, and volatile nitrites. Nicotine addiction includes nicotine addiction of all known forms, such as, for example, nicotine addiction resulting from cigarette, cigar and / or pipe smoking, as well as addiction resulting from tobacco chewing. In this respect, due to their activity as norepinephrine and dopamine uptake inhibitors, the compounds of the present invention function in a manner similar to that of buproprion (ZYBAN®, GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA), by reducing the craving for the nicotine stimulus. As a benefit beyond the therapeutic activity of buproprion, however, the compounds of the present invention provide an additional serotonergic component.<br>
[0033] Compounds of the present invention are also effective in the prophylaxis of migraine<br>
[0034] The magnitude of a prophylactic or therapeutic dose of a compound of formula A-F, P or Q will vary with the nature and severity of the condition to be treated and the route of administration. The dose, and perhaps the dose frequency, will also vary according to the age, body weight and response of<br><br>
the individual patient. In general, the total daily dose ranges of compounds of the present invention will be from about 25 mg per day to about 1000 mg per day, preferably about 100 mg per day to about 600 mg per day, in single or divided doses.<br>
[0035] It is further recommended that children, patients over 65 years old, and those with impaired renal or hepatic function, initially receive low doses and that the dosage be titrated based on individual responses and blood levels. It may be necessary to use dosages outside these ranges in some cases, as will be apparent to those in the art. Further, it is noted that the clinician or treating physician knows how and when to interrupt, adjust or terminate therapy in conjunction with individual patient's response.<br>
[0036] Any suitable route of administration may be employed. For example, oral, rectal, intranasal, and parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, and intravenous) routes may be employed. Dosage forms can include tablets, troches, dispersions, suspensions, solutions, capsules and patches.<br>
[0037] Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention include as active ingredient, a single compound, or a mixture of compounds, of formula A-F, P or Q, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of P or Q, together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and, optionally, with other therapeutic ingredients.<br>
[0038] The term "pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof refers to salts prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic acids including inorganic acids and organic acids. Exemplary acids that form pharmaceutically acceptable salts with the amines of the invention, and that may be used in the compositions of the present invention are acetic acid, benzenesulfonic (besylate) acid, benzoic acid, isethionic acid, camphorsulfonic acid, citric acid,<br><br>
ethenesulfonic acid, fumaric acid, gluconic acid, glutamic acid, hydrobromic acid, hydrochloric acid, lactic acid, maleic acid, malic acid, mandelic acid, methanesulfonic acid, mucic acid, nitric acid, pamoic acid, pantothenic acid, phosphoric acid, succinic acid, sulfuric acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid and tartaric acid. The hydrochloric acid salt is particularly preferred.<br>
[0039] Compositions suitable for oral, rectal, and parenteral administration are encompassed by the present invention. A preferred route of administration is oral. The compositions may be conveniently presented in unit dosage form and prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. Preferred unit dosage formulations are those containing a therapeutically effective dose, or an appropriate fraction thereof, of the active ingredient(s).<br>
[0040] The compositions of the present invention will also include a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The carrier may take a wide variety of forms, depending on the route desired for administration, for example, oral or parenteral (including intravenous). In preparing the composition for oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed, such as, water, glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, and coloring agents in the case of oral liquid preparation, including suspension, elixirs and solutions. Carriers such as starches, sugars, microcrystalline cellulose, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders and disintegrating agents may be used in the case of oral solid preparations such as powders, capsules and caplets, with the solid oral preparation being preferred over the liquid preparations. Preferred solid oral preparations are tablets or capsules, because of their ease of administration. If desired, tablets may be coated by a standard aqueous or nonaqueous techniques. Oral and parenteral sustained release dosage forms may also be used.<br><br>
[0041] Oral syrups, as well as other oral liquid formulations, are well known to those skilled in the art, and general methods for preparing them are found in any standard pharmacy school textbook, for example Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy. Chapter 86 of the 19th edition of Remington entitled "Solutions, Emulsions, Suspensions and Extracts" describes in complete detail the preparation of syrups (pages 1503-1505) and other oral liquids.<br>
[0042] Similarly, sustained release formulation is well known in the art, and Chapter 94 of the same reference, entitled "Sustained-Release Drug Delivery Systems," describes the more common types of oral and parenteral sustained-release dosage forms (pages 1660-1675.) The relevant disclosure of each of these chapters is incorporated herein by reference. Because they reduce peak plasma concentrations, as compared to conventional oral dosage forms, controlled release dosage forms are particularly useful for providing therapeutic plasma concentrations while avoiding the side effects associated with high peak plasma concentrations that occur with conventional dosage forms.<br>
[0043] Synthesis of 2-methyl-propane-2-sulfinic acid [4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-i,2,3,4-tetrahydro-naphthalen-y-yl]-amide (tetralone t -butanesulfinimine): To a solution of 4-((3,4-dicholorophenyl)-3,4-dihydro-l-naphthalenone (12 g) in THF (40 mL) was added (^H-butanesulfinamide (5.2 g) and Ti(OEt)4 (85 mL 20%) in EtOH. The reaction mixture was heated to 60°C for 13 h. The reaction mixture was cooled to it, and poured into a brine solution (100 mL) with stirring. The suspension was then added to EtOAc (300 mL) and stirred for 10 min. The suspension was filtered and the filtrate was concentrated to ca 50 mL. One hundred milliliters of EtOAc was added and the organic phase was separated and concentrated to give a crude reaction mixture. The final products were isolated from the crude products by careful flash column<br><br>

[0051] The compounds of the invention were tested for their inhibition of functional uptake of serotonin (5-HT), norepinephrine (NE), or dopamine (DA), in synaptosomes prepared from rat whole brain, hypothalamus, or corpus striatum, respectively. Compounds were tested initially at 10 uM in duplicate, and if &gt;50% inhibition of uptake was observed, they were tested further at 10 different concentrations in duplicate in order to obtain full inhibition curves. IC50 values (concentration inhibiting control activity by 50%) were then determined by nonlinear regression analysis of the inhibition curves and tabulated below.<br><br>
EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS FOR MONOAMINE UPTAKE ASSAYS<br>
Serotonin functional uptake assay<br>
[0052] Characterization of serotonin uptake is performed using synaptosomes isolated in a 0.32M sucrose buffer from a male Wistar rat cortex. The uptake of radiolabeled serotonin by synaptosomes (100 ug of proteins/point) is allowed by incubating them in a deep well for 15 min at 37°C in presence of test compounds and [Tfl5-hydroxytryptamine (O.luCi/point).<br>
[0053] Synaptosomes and [ H]5-hydroxytryptamine are prepared in a Krebs buffer pH 7.4 containing 25 mM NaHC03, 11 mM glucose and 50 uM ascorbic acid. This incubation buffer is oxygenated during 5 minutes before incubation. Basal control is incubated for 15 minutes at 4°C in order to avoid any uptake. Following this incubation the uptake is stopped by filtration through an "unifilter 96-wells GFB Packard plate" washed with Krebs buffer containing 25 mM NaHC03 in order to eliminate the free [TTJ5-hydroxytryptamine. The radioactivity associated to the synaptosomes retained onto the unifilter corresponding to the uptake is then measured with a microplate scintillation counter Topcount, Packard using a scintillation liquid microscint 0, Packard.<br>
[0054] The reference compound is unipramine tested at 10 concentrations ranging<br>
11	5<br>
from 10" M to 10" M in order to obtain an IC50 value. See, Perovics and Mixller, "Pharmacological profile of hypericum extract: effect on serotonin uptake by postsynaptic receptors," Arzeim. Forsch. /DrugRes., 45:1145-1148 (1995).<br><br>
Dopamine functional uptake assay<br>
[0055] Characterization of dopamine uptake is performed using synaptosomes isolated at Cerep in a 0.32 M sucrose buffer from a male Wistar rat striatum. The uptake of radiolabelled dopamine by synaptosomes (20 jag of proteins/point) is allowed by incubating them for 15 minutes at 37°C in presence of test compounds and [ H]-dopamine (O.ljiCi/point). The experiment is performed in a deep well. Synaptosomes and [ H]-dopamine are prepared in a Krebs buffer pH 7.4 containing 25 mM NaHC03, 11 mM glucose and 50 uM ascorbic acid. This incubation buffer is oxygenated during 5 minutes before incubation. Basal control is incubated for 15 minutes at 4°C in order to avoid any uptake. Following this incubation the uptake is stopped by filtration through an "unifilter 96-wells GFB Packard plate" washed with Krebs buffer containing 25 mM NaHC03 in order to eliminate free [ H]-dopamine. The radioactivity associated to the synaptosomes retained onto the unifilter corresponding to the uptake is then measured with a microplate scintillation counter Topcount, Packard using a scintillation liquid microscint 0, Packard. The reference compound is GRB12909 tested at 8 concentrations ranging from 10" M to 10 M in order to obtain an IC50 value. See, Jankowsky et al., "Characterization of sodium-dependent [ H]GBR-12935 binding in brain: a radioligand for selective labeling of the dopamine transport complex," J. Neurochem, 46:1272-1276 (1986).<br>
Norepinephrine functional uptake assay<br>
[0056] Characterization of norepinephrine uptake is performed using synaptosomes isolated at Cerep in a 0.32 M sucrose buffer from a male Wistar rat hypothalamus. The uptake of radiolabeled norepinephrine by synaptosomes (100 ug of proteins/point) is allowed by incubating them for 20 minutes at<br><br>
37°C in presence of test compounds and f H]-norepinephrine (0.1u€i/point). The experiment is performed in a deep well.<br>
[0057] Synaptosomes and [ H]-norepinephrine are prepared in a Krebs buffer pH 7.4 containing 25 mM NaHCC&gt;3, 11 mM glucose and 50 uM ascorbic acid. This incubation buffer is oxygenated during 5 minutes before incubation. Basal control is incubated for 20 minutes at 4°C in order to avoid any uptake. Following this incubation the uptake is stopped by filtration through an "unifilter 96-wells GFB "Packard plate washed with Krebs buffer containing 25 mM NaHC03 in order to eliminate the free [ H]-norepinephrine. The radioactivity associated to the synaptosomes retained onto the unifilter corresponding to the uptake is then measured with a microplate scintillation counter Topcount, Packard using a scintillation liquid microscmt 0, Packard.<br>
[0058] The reference compound is imipramine tested at 13 concentrations ranging from 10" M to 10" M in order to obtain an IC50 value. See, Perovics and Muller, "Pharmacological profile of hypericum extract: effect on serotonin uptake by postsynaptic receptors," Arzeim. Forsch. /DrugRes., 45:1145-1148 (1995).

[0059] As shown in Table 1, P and Q exhibit similar inhibitory potency on the<br>
neuronal uptake of NE, DA, and 5HT. Currently, the therapeutic approach to<br>
treating affective disorders in man is the selective inhibition of a single<br>
monoamine uptake mechanism or the dual inhibition of two of these molecular<br>
targets. The equipotent inhibition of the neuronal uptake of NE, DA and 5HT<br>
provides the clinician with the ability to more effectively treat affective<br>
disorders and eating disorders by elevating all of the monoamine levels in the<br>
brain simultaneously and over the same dose-range without the need to titrate<br>
separate drugs. For those CNS disorders that are presently treated with<br>
dopaminergic, norepinephrine or mixed DA-NE uptake inhibitors (e.g. OCD,<br>
ADD,  ADHD,   sexual dysfunction and  substance abuse),  the equipotent<br>
inhibition of the neuronal uptake of NE, DA and 5HT provides more effective<br>
treatment by adding the serotonergic effect.<br>
