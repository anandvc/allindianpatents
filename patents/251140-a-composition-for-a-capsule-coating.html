				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a composition for capsule coating containing a<br>
 gelatin, a capsule coating, and a capsule using the same.<br>
The present invention claims priority on Japanese Patent Application No.<br>
2004-223745 filed on July 30,2004, and Japanese Patent Application No. 2005-129968<br>
filed on April 27, 2005, the content of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002]<br>
In the field of food and drugs, gelatin capsules using gelatin for the coating<br>
thereof are usually used in terms of safety, rapid solubility inside the body, and the like.<br>
However, cross-linking caused by interaction between a gelatin molecule and at least one<br>
of filled contents and decomposed matter thereof tends to cause a decrease in the coating<br>
solubility of gelatin capsules, which influences the bioavailability of active ingredients.<br>
This problem significantly occurs when the filled contents include galenicals, higher<br>
unsaturated fatty acids such as DHA, EPA, or the like, unsaturated fatty acid<br>
residue-containing oils and fats, minerals, mineral-containing yeasts, vitamin C, and the<br>
like, in particular.<br>
In order to solve the above-mentioned problem, (1) the addition of amino acids,<br>
citric acids, tartaric acids, or fumaric acids to gelatin coating (Patent Document 1 and<br>
Patent Document 2), (2) the addition of pullulan and polypeptide to gelatin coating<br>
(Patent Document 3), and the like have been proposed.<br>
[0003]<br>
Moreover, it is known as a general problem of a soft capsule that the adhesion<br>
thickness of a coating joined portion cannot be sufficiently obtained when the capsule is<br>
formed, and so the strength of the capsule becomes insufficient. Therefore, leakage of<br>
the contents of the capsule, rupture of the capsule, or the like is caused.<br>

DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
[Problems to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
[0004]<br>
However, the above-mentioned prior arts (1) and (2) have not yet resulted in<br>
sufficient prevention of the decrease in the coating solubility.<br>
Also, the effects of the improvement in the strength of the soft capsule are not<br>
necessarily sufficient.<br>
The present invention has been achieved in view of the above-mentioned<br>
circumstances, and has as an object thereof to provide a composition for a capsule<br>
coating which can highly suppress the decrease in the coating solubility over time, and<br>
can particularly give a sufficient capsular strength in the case of a soft capsule, and<br>
provide a capsule coating and a capsule using the same.<br>
[Means for Solving the Problems]<br>
[0005]<br>
The inventors of the present invention found that the above-mentioned problem<br>
can be solved by formulating an inositol phosphate into a capsule coating, and thus<br>
arrived at the present invention.<br>
[0006]<br>
That is, a composition for capsule coating according to the <br>
characterized by containing a gelatin (A) and an inositol phosphate (B) represented by the<br>
general formula: C6O6H12-n,(H2PO4)n (in the formula, n represents an integer from 1 to 6).<br>
A capsule coating according to the present invention is characterized by<br>
containing a gelatin (A) and an inositol phosphate (B) represented by the general<br>
formula C5O6H12-n (H2PO3)„ (in the formula, n represents an integer from 1 to 6). In the<br>
capsule coating according to the present invention, it is preferable that the component (B)<br>
contain an inositol hexaphosphate.<br>
[0007]<br>
A capsule according to the present invention is characterized by including the<br>
capsule coating according to the present invention. The capsule according to the present<br>
invention is particularly effective when a filled content thereof contains at least one<br>
selected from the group consisting of galenicals, unsaturated fatty acids, unsaturated fatty<br>
acid residue-containing oils and fats, minerals, mineral-containing yeasts, and vitamin C.<br>
Also, it is preferable that the capsule according to the present invention has a filled<br>
content containing at least one selected from the group consisting of phospholipids,<br>
amino sugars, and organic acids. Moreover, the capsule according to the present<br>
invention is particularly effective in the case of a soft capsule.<br>
10008]<br>
The capsule according to the present invention may be a soft capsule.<br>
A production method of the soft capsule is characterized by including a<br>
production step of the composition for capsule coating containing at least a gelatin (A)<br>
and an inositol phosphate (B) represented by the general formula:C6O6H12-n,(H2PO3)n(in<br>
the formula, n represents an integer from 1 to 6), and an encapsulation step in which the<br>
capsule coating is produced from the composition for capsule coating and a content to be<br>
filled in the capsule is interposed between the capsule coating followed by conducting<br>
pressure bonding.<br>
Also, the above-mentioned production method may further include a step of<br>
preparing the content to be filled containing at least one selected from the group<br>
consisting of phospholipids, amino sugars, and organic acids, <br>
[Effects of the Invention] <br>
[0009] <br>
According to the present invention, a composition for capsule coating which<br>
can highly suppress the decrease in gelatin-coating solubility over time, and can<br>
particularly impart a sufficient capsular strength in the case of a soft capsule, as well as a<br>
capsule coating and a capsule using the same can be provided.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
[0010]<br>
In the following, the present invention will be explained in detail.<br>
"Composition for capsule coating and capsule coating"<br>
The composition for the capsule coating according to the present invention is a<br>
composition used for producing a capsule coating, and is characterized by containing at<br>
least a gelatin (A) and an inositol phosphate (B) represented by the general formula:<br>
C6O6H12-n(H2PO3)n (in the formula, n represents an integer from 1 to 6).<br>
The capsule coating according to the present invention is characterized by<br>
containing the gelatin (A) and the inositol phosphate (B) represented by the general<br>
formula:C6O6H12-n(H2PO3)n (in the formula, n represents an integer from 1 to 6).<br>
The inventors of the present invention found that addition of the inositol<br>
phosphate to the gelatin coating significantly prevents the decrease incoating solubility<br>
over time, that is, the decrease caused by, for example, cross-linking generated by<br>
interaction between a gelatin molecule and filled contents or decomposed matter thereof,<br>
and, in the case of a soft capsule, the addition causes joined portions of coating to be<br>
bonded with a sufficient thickness. Therefore, the addition can impart a sufficient<br>
capsular strength and prevent leakage of the content from the joined portions of the<br>
coating, the rupture of the capsule, or the like.<br>
[0011]<br>
The gelatin (A), which is a main component, is not particularly limited, and<br>
well-known gelatins used for general capsules, such as acid-treated gelatins, alkali-treated<br>
gelatins, amphoterically-treated gelatins, chemically-modified gelatins, or the like may be<br>
used. These may be used alone or in combination with two or more kinds thereof.<br>
The gelatin is extracted after hydrolyzing a collagen, and, as a hydrolytic agent,<br>
the "acid-treated gelatin" uses an acid such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, or the like,<br>
the "alkali-treated gelatin" uses alkalis such as lime or the like, and the<br>
"amphoterically-treated gelatin" uses both the acid and the alkali. Moreover, the<br>
"chemically-modified gelatin" is one obtained by reacting an amino group of the gelatin<br>
with an orgamc acid such as succinic acid, phthalic acid, or the like. Among them, the<br>
acid-treated gelatin and the alkali-treated gelatin are preferably used.<br>
[0012]<br>
The inositol phosphate (B) is one represented by the above-formula, and<br>
examples thereof include inositol monophosphate, inositol diphosphate, inositol<br>
triphosphate, inositol tetraphosphate, inositol pentaphosphate, and inositol hexaphosphate<br>
(phytic acid), each of which has 1 to 6 phosphate groups inserted therein (n=l to 6).<br>
These may be used alone or in combination with two or more kinds thereof.<br>
Among them, it is preferable to use as the component (B) inositol phosphates<br>
having 3 to 6 phosphate groups (n=3 to 6), and particularly phytic acid having 6<br>
phosphate groups (n=6); because effects of preventing the decrease in the solubility and<br>
increasing strength are excellently exhibited.<br>
[0013]<br>
The amount of the inositol phosphate (B) added is not particularly limited.<br>
However, when the amount of the component (B) is extremely low, effects obtained by<br>
adding the component (effects of preventing the decrease in solubility and increasing the<br>
strength) may not be sufficiently exhibited. On the other hand, when the amount is<br>
extremely high, particularly in the case of the soft capsule, the decrease in capsular<br>
strength or adhesion between capsules may be caused by decreasing the pH of the coating<br>
or relatively decreasing the amount of gelatin. Accordingly, it is preferable that the<br>
amount of the inositol phosphate (B) contained in the capsule coating be 0.05 to 15% by<br>
mass, more preferably 1 to 10% by mass, and even more preferably 2 to 8% by mass,<br>
with respect to the amount of the gelatin (A).<br>
[0014]<br>
In addition to the component (A) and the component (B), various additives<br>
generally used for capsule coatings, such as, for example, plasticizers such as glycerin or<br>
sorbitol for components other than the component (B), such as amino acids, citric acids,<br>
or the like, antiseptics, coloring agents such as dyes or titanium oxide, organic acids, or<br>
the like may be contained in the composition for capsule coating and the capsule coating<br>
according to the present invention, as needed.<br>
[0015]<br>
The composition for capsule coating can be produced by mixing and dissolving<br>
the components (A) and (B), and further various additives, as needed, in water at room<br>
temperature or while heating.<br>
[0016]<br>
In brief explanation, the capsule coating can be produced by making the<br>
composition for capsule coating into a film, forming the film into a predetermined shape,<br>
and then drying. Although the content of water contained in the capsule coating after<br>
drying is not particularly limited, 5 to 20% by mass, particularly 7 to 15% by mass is<br>
preferable.<br>
The time for forming the capsule coating and filling the content thereof is<br>
determined depending on the type of the capsule. Although the present invention is<br>
applicable for both soft capsules and hard capsules, the soft capsules are particularly<br>
preferable.<br>
The "soft capsule" is produced by formulating a plasticizer such as glycerin,<br>
sorbitol, or the like, encapsulating a content to be filled by a film-like capsule coating<br>
which is relatively soft with increased plasticity, and forming it into a predetermined<br>
shape at the same time as or after encapsulating the content (encapsulation forming).<br>
The "hard capsule" is produced by directly filling a content to be filled into a capsule<br>
coating which is manufactured into a predetermined shape with relative hardness in<br>
advance, or by slightly conducting shape forming after filling the content.<br>
[0017]<br>
The present invention is particularly effective in the case of the soft capsule<br>
which relatively tends to generate cross-linking caused by interaction between a gelatin<br>
molecule and the filled content or decomposed matter thereof.<br>
In the case of the soft capsule, the capsule can be produced by, for example,<br>
processing the composition for capsule coating into a film using a rotatory type soft<br>
capsule filler, supplying the film into a roll-metal mold from both left and right sides<br>
thereof, inserting while pressing a content to be filled into it just before punching it out<br>
into a predetermined shape, conducting shape forming, and drying.<br>
In i:he case of the hard capsule, an immersion method in which a stainless-steel<br>
mold-pin is immersed in an immersion fluid prepared by dissolving a gelatin in purified<br>
water while stirring and adding inositol phophate to the solution, and the mold-pin is<br>
rotated in order to be dried can be used, for example.<br>
[0018]<br>
This composition for capsule coating and the capsule coating according to the<br>
present invention can significantly prevent the decrease in the solubility of the gelatin<br>
coating over time by formulating inositol phosphate (B), and, particularly, when the<br>
capsule coating is applied to a soft capsule, a sufficient strength can be further given by<br>
increasing the thickness of the joined portion of the capsule coating.<br>
The technology of the present invention enables the use of conventional<br>
methods without a change in the production of a capsule except that inositol phosphate<br>
(B) is added to a conventional coating composition, and therefore, is preferable.<br>
[0019]<br>
"Capsule"<br>
A capsule according to the present invention is characterized by including the<br>
above-mentioned capsule coating of the present invention. Although the capsule may<br>
be either a soft capsule or a hard capsule as described above , the soft capsule is<br>
particularly preferable.<br>
The form of the filled content is not particularly limited, and it may be a liquid,<br>
suspension, paste, powder, granular, or the like. In the case of the granular, coating may<br>
be formed using a coating agent.<br>
[0020]<br>
The capsule of the present invention can be used for various applications such<br>
as pharmaceuticals, quasi-drugs, health foods, general foods, cosmetics, or the like, and<br>
the constitution of the filled content is arbitrarily determined depending on the<br>
application of the capsule.<br>
In ihe present invention, formulation of inositol phosphate (B) into the capsule<br>
coating can significantly inhibit the decrease in the coating solubility over time, and,<br>
particularly, when the capsule coating is applied to a soft capsule, the thickness of the<br>
joined portion of the capsule coating can be increased, so a sufficient strength can be<br>
further given and effects can be exhibited in spite of the constitution of the filled content.<br>
Moreover, the inventors of the present invention have found that when at least<br>
one selected from the group consisting of phospholipids, amino sugars, and organic acids<br>
is added to the tilled content, effects exhibited by the filled content on the capsule coating<br>
decrease, so Ihe coating solubility can be further prevented from decreasing over time.<br>
[0021]<br>
The "phospholipid" is not particularly limited, and examples thereof include<br>
phosphatidyl serine, phosphatidylcholine (lecithin), phosphatidylinositol,<br>
phosphatidylethanolamine (cephalin), phosphatidylcardiolipin, phosphatidic acid,<br>
sphingomyelin, derivatives thereof, and the like. These may be used alone or in<br>
combination with two or more kinds thereof.<br>
Among them, phosphatidylethanolamine and derivatives thereof are preferable<br>
in view of their excellent effects of preventing the decrease in solubility. Examples of<br>
the derivatives of phosphatidylethanolamine include a monoacyl type (lyzo type), alkenyl<br>
type, N-methyl type and N, N-dimethyl type in which base portions are methylated,<br>
N-acyl type, rand the like, of a phosphatidylethanolamine that is a diacyl type.<br>
As phospholipid-containing products containing at least one of the<br>
above-mentioned phospholipids, soybean phospholipid (soybean lecithin), yolk<br>
phospholipid (yolk lecithin), and the like are commercially available, and these are easily<br>
obtained and exhibit excellent effects, and so are preferably used. These may be<br>
purified products or crudely purified products, and also may be hydrogenated products or<br>
powdered products.<br>
[0022]<br>
The "amino sugar" is not particularly limited, and saccharides containing an<br>
amino group such as glucosamine, N-acetyl glucosamine, galactosamine, N-acetyl<br>
galactosamine, N-acetyl neuraminic acid, and the like, or polymers of glucosamine can<br>
be used, for example. Specific examples thereof include compounds having a structure<br>
in which a hydroxyl group of the saccharide is replaced with an amino group, such as<br>
chitosan and the derivatives thereof, polygalactosamine and derivatives thereof.<br>
Examples of chitosan and the derivatives thereof include low-molecular-weight chitosan,<br>
high-molecular-weight chitosan, chitosan oligosaccharide, and the like, and all those<br>
obtained by deacetylating chitins are preferably used. The amino sugars may be used<br>
alone or in combination with two or more kinds thereof.<br>
[0023]<br>
The "organic acid" is not particularly limited, and examples thereof include<br>
amino acids such as tryptophan, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, glycine, phenylalanine,<br>
arginine, lysine, and the like, citric acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, lactic<br>
acid, malic acid, inositol phosphate, and the like. These may be used alone or in<br>
combination with two or more kinds thereof.<br>
Among them, inositol phosphate and citric acid are preferable in view of their<br>
excellent inhibitory effects against the decrease in the solubility. As inositol phosphate,<br>
although the above-mentioned ones may be used, phytic acid is preferably used, in<br>
particular.<br>
[0024]<br>
As described above, the filled content may contain at least one selected from<br>
the group consisting of phospholipids, amino sugars, and organic acids, and the case in<br>
which phospholipids and organic acids are contained is particularly preferable.<br>
Although the amount of these added is not particularly limited, an extremely small<br>
addition cannot demonstrate sufficient effects due to the addition, while an extremely<br>
large addition relatively decreases the amount of an active ingredient of pharmaceuticals<br>
or the like. Accordingly, it is preferable that the total amount of an addition with respect<br>
to the total amount of the filled content be 0.05 to 20% by mass, more preferably 0.1 to<br>
10% by mass, and even more preferably 0.5 to 10% by mass.<br>
[0025]<br>
Although the present invention can exhibit effects in spite of the constitution of<br>
the filled content, it is particularly effective when the filled content contains at least one<br>
selected from the group consisting of galenicals, unsaturated fatty acids, unsaturated fatty<br>
acid residue-containing oils and fats, minerals, mineral-containing yeasts, and vitamin C,<br>
because these significantly decrease the solubility of gelatin coating in the prior art.<br>
[0026]<br>
The term "galenicals" refers to those used in raw materials for pharmaceuticals<br>
(including Qiinese medicinal drugs and folk medicines), perfumery, or spices, without<br>
modification or after being simply processed or prepared by, for example, cutting,<br>
crushing, and drying a part or all of an animal, a plant, or a mineral without changing the<br>
nature thereof. In the capsule, the galenicals may be used in the form of powder,<br>
extract, essence, tincture, or the like.<br>

The filled content may include at least one of these galenicals.<br>
The present invention is particularly effective when the filled content includes<br>
rosemary, citrus, blueberry, bilberry, propolis, Panaxnotoginseng, Panaxginseng,<br>
Agaricus, Phellinus linteus, shiitake mushroom, Ganoderma lucidum, and essences<br>
thereof, because the effect of preventing the decrease in coating solubility is significant.<br>
[0028]<br>
Although the "unsaturated fatty acid" is not particularly limited, the present<br>
invention is particularly effective when the filled content contains a long-chain<br>
unsaturated fatty acid having at least 14 carbon atoms, and more preferably 14 to 22<br>
carbon atoms, because the effect of preventing the decrease in coating solubility is<br>
significant.<br>
Examples of the long-chain unsaturated fatty acid having at least 14 carbon<br>
atoms include DHA (docosahexaenoic acid), EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid), linoleic acid,<br>
arachidonic acid, oleic acid, pinolenic acid, sciadonic acid, Jinoiperon acid, columbinic<br>
acid, conjugated linoleic acid, eleostearic acid, octadecenoic acid, octadecadienoic acid,<br>
docosenoic acid, ricinoleic acid, a-linolenic acid, y-linolenic acid, behenic acid, and the<br>
like. The filled content may contain at least one of these unsaturated fatty acids. The<br>
present invention is particularly effective when the filled content contains DHA and/or<br>
EPA.<br>
The unsaturated fatty acid may be formulated in the form of an isolated product<br>
of the unsaturated fatty acid or oil containing the same.<br>
[0029]<br>
The phrase "unsaturated fatty acid residue-containing oils and fats" refers to<br>
oils and fats in which at least one of fatty acid residues composing the oils and fats is an<br>
unsaturated fatty acid residue.<br>
Examples of the oils containing at least one of the unsaturated fatty acid<br>
residue-containing oils and fats include vegetable oils such as soybean oil, rape seed oil,<br>
rice bran oil, cotton seed oil, sesame oil, sunflower oil, mustard oil, safflower oil, corn<br>
oil, peanut oil, olive oil, palm oil, coconut oil, and the like, and animal oils such as fish<br>
oil, whale oil, beef tallow, lard, milk fat, and the like. The filled content may contain at<br>
least one of these oils.<br>
The present invention is particularly effective when the filled content contains a<br>
fish oil, because many unsaturated fatty acids (DHA and EPA) described above are also<br>
contained in the unsaturated fatty acid residue-containing oils and fats, and the effect of<br>
preventing the decrease in coating solubility is significant.<br>
[0030]<br>
The "mineral" is not particularly limited, and it refers to an inorganic substance<br>
that is useful from a nutritional standpoint. Examples thereof include calcium,<br>
phosphorus, iron, sodium, potassium, magnesium, zinc, selenium, copper, and the like.<br>
Among them, the present invention is particularly effective when calcium, phosphorus,<br>
iron, magnesium, zinc, selenium, or copper is contained, because use of polyvalent<br>
elements as a. content filled in a conventional capsule significantly causes the<br>
insolubilization of the coating thereof, but the insolubilization can be inhibited in the<br>
capsule of the present invention. These may be used as inorganic or organic salts used<br>
for common foods.<br>
[0031]<br>
The "mineral-containing yeast" is not particularly limited, and examples thereof<br>
include magnesium-containing yeasts, zinc-containing yeasts, selenium-containing<br>
yeasts, iron-containing yeasts, copper-containing yeasts, and the like. The<br>
mineral-containing yeast is one in which a mineral is incorporated in the yeast body.<br>
[0032]<br>
The filled content may arbitrarily contain, in addition to the above-mentioned<br>
components, additives generally used for pharmaceuticals, food, or the like, such as<br>
excipients, bonding agents, disintegrators, stabilizers, dispersants, coloring agents,<br>
flavoring compounds, medium-chain fatty acid monoglycerides, medium-chain fatty acid<br>
triglycerides, polyethylene glycols, surfactants (glycerin fatty acid esters, or the like),<br>
antioxidants (vitamin E, astaxanthin, catechin, or the like), or the like, as needed.<br>
[0033]<br>
Since the capsule of the present invention includes the capsule coating of the<br>
present invention, the decrease in solubility over time is significantly prevented, and<br>
particularly in the case of a soft capsule, a sufficient strength is given to the capsule.<br>
Paiticularly, formulation of at least one selected from the group consisting of<br>
phospholipids, amino sugars, and organic acids in the filled content can further prevent<br>
the decrease in solubility, and is preferable.<br>
[Examples]<br>
[0034]<br>
In ihe following, although test examples with respect to the present invention<br>
will be mentioned, the present invention is not limited to these.<br>
Effect of Inhibiting Decrease in Coating Solubility<br>
"Test Example 1" (Examples 1-1, 1-2 and Comparative Examples 1-1 to 1-3)<br>
(Preparation of Gelatin Coating)<br>
100 g of gelatin and 45 g of glycerin were added to 100 g of purified water to<br>
make them absorb water and swell, followed by dissolving them at approximately 80°C<br>
to prepare a gelatin solution. To this solution, each organic acid of which the kind and<br>
content are indicated in Table 1 (the concentration shown in the table represents the<br>
concentration (% by mass) with respect to the total amount of composition) was added,<br>
mixed, and then deaerated under reduced pressure to prepare a composition for capsule<br>
coating.<br>
Each obtained composition was poured into a TLC plate, uniformly spread to a<br>
thickness of 1 mm, and then dried at 30°C for 24 hours to obtain a film-like gelatin<br>
coating having a moisture content of approximately 9%. The coating obtained in each<br>
example was cut into a 1 cm x 1 cm piece, and used for the following evaluation.<br>
[0035]<br>
(Evaluation)<br>
15 ml of DHA (fish oil) was poured in a screw tube, into which two pieces of<br>
each gelatin coating piece prepared in the respective example were immersed, and stored<br>
at 50°C. After one or two day(s), the gelatin coating pieces were taken out, and the<br>
content adhered to the pieces was removed, followed by putting the pieces in 200 ml of<br>
hot water at 60°C and stirring them with a stirrer bar for 2 minutes. The pieces were<br>
visually observed in the state of repose, and evaluated in accordance with the following<br>
criteria.<br>
Criteria for Evaluation<br>
(-): The gelatin coating pieces were completely dissolved, and undissolved<br>
pieces thereof were not recognized.<br>
(i): Undissolved pieces were slightly recognized.<br>
(+): Undissolved pieces were recognized in small amounts.<br>
(-H-): Undissolved pieces were recognized in medium amounts.<br>
(-+-+): Undissolved pieces were recognized in large amounts.<br>
(+-+-+-): The gelatin coating pieces were not dissolved at all, and completely<br>
insolubilized.<br>
[0036]<br>
(Results)<br>
Results are shown in Table 1.<br>
In Comparative Examples 1-1 to 1-3, the gelatin coating was completely<br>
insolubilized after two days, while in Examples 1-1 and 1-2 in which inositol<br>
hexaphosphate (phytic acid) was added, the gelatin coating was completely dissolved<br>
even after two days. Accordingly, it was apparent that addition of inositol<br>
hexaphosphate significantly prevented the decrease in solubility of the gelatin coating<br>
over time.<br>
[0037]<br><br>
[0038]<br>
"Test Example 2" (Examples 2-1 to 2-13)<br>
(Preparation of Soft Capsule)<br>
Each composition for the capsule coating composed of 45% by mass of gelatin,<br>
18% by mass of glycerin, inositol phosphate of the kind in an amount as indicated in<br>
Table 2 (the concentration shown in the table represents the concentration (% by mass)<br>
with respect to the total amount of respective composition), and water (the remnant) was<br>
produced in the same way as that of Test Example 1, followed by deaerating and being<br>
kept for 10 hours to use for producing capsules.<br>
Each component of which the kind and content are indicated in the same table<br>
was filled using a rotatory type soft capsule filler (Oval Type 5). After filling, each<br>
capsule coating was dried at 27°C under 50% or lower humidity till the moisture content<br>
in the capsule coating became 8% and so a soft capsule was prepared.<br>
[0039]<br><br>
Effect of Giving Strength to Capsule<br>
"Test Example 3" (Example 3 and Comparative Example 3)<br>
(Preparation of Gelatin Coating and Soft Capsule)<br>
A gelatin solution (A) composed of 45% by mass of gelatin, 18% by mass of<br>
glycerin, 1% by mass of inositol hexaphosphate (phytic acid), and 36% by mass of water,<br>
and a gelatin solution (B) composed of 45% by mass of gelatin, 18% by mass of glycerin,<br>
and 37% by mass of water were each prepared, dissolved at 80°C, deaerated, and then<br>
kept for about 10 hours. Each gelatin coating with a thickness of 0.90 mm was formed<br>
from the gelatin solution (A) or (B) using a rotatory type soft capsule filler (Oval Type<br>
5), into which 300 mg of DHA (fish oil) was filled to prepare soft capsules. The<br>
capsules were evaluated as described below.<br>
[0041]<br>
(Evaluation)<br>
Immediately after starting to fill each, filled capsules No. 1, No. 4, and No. 7<br>
(front, middle, back) were sampled from capsule filler metal molds No. 1 to No. 7, and<br>
each content thereof was removed therefrom, followed by cutting in round slices to<br>
measure the thickness of the thinnest portion of the joined portion thereof using a<br>
microscope with a scale for comparison. Moreover, after operating the filler for 1 hour<br>
using the respective gelatin solution, filled capsules were sampled in the same way as<br>
described above, and the thickness of the thinnest portion of the joined portion thereof<br>
was measured for evaluation. Next, the adhesion ratio was calculated from the<br>
thickness of the joined portion for evaluation.<br>
[0042]<br>
(Results)<br>
Results are shown in Table 3 and Table 4.<br>
In comparison with Comparative Example 3 in which the capsules were<br>
produced using the gelatin solution (B), Example 3 in which the capsules were produced<br>
using the gelatin solution (A) containing inositol hexaphosphate (phytic acid)<br>
demonstrated a high adhesion ratio and it was confirmed that the strength of the capsules<br>
increased.<br>
