The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in<br>
which it is to be performed<br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The   present   invention   relates   to   the   premix   pharmaceutical   formulation   comprising<br>
anhydrous lanthanum carbonate.<br>
The present invention relates to a stable pharmaceutical formulation comprising anhydrous<br>
lanthanum carbonate and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and/or excipients and the<br>
process for the preparation of pharmaceutical formulation comprising anhydrous lanthanum<br>
carbonate.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Hyperphosphatemia is a particular problem of patients with chronic renal insufficiency or chronic kidney disease (CKD). Approximately 70% of patients with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on renal dialysis therapy require treatment for hyperphosphatemia. This condition can lead to severe bone problems and metastatic calcification of skin and major organs and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Elevated phosphate levels are treated using a combination of dietary restrictions and phosphate-binding agents.<br>
Another problem of patients with chronic renal insufficiency is secondary hyperparathyroidism. It is also important in patients with chronic renal insufficiency to avoid and treat secondary hyperparathyroidism,<br>
Certain forms of lanthanum carbonate have been used to treat hyperphosphatemia in patients with renal failure (see, e.g., JP 1876384).<br>
Japanese Published Patent Application Number 62-145024 (Asahi Chemical Ind. KK) discloses that rare earth carbonates, bicarbonates or organic acid compounds may be used as phosphate binding agents. The application relates to the use of lanthanum carbonate, although in the tests described, cerium organic acid salts and carbonate gave better phosphate ion extraction than lanthanum carbonate. The patent application does not disclose the use of anhydrous lanthanum carbonate as phosphate binding agent.<br>
United States Patent Number 5,968,976 describes the use of La2(C03)3.xH20, where x has a value of 3 to 6, for the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of hyperphosphataemia by administration into the gastrointestinal tract. The patent discloses that phosphate binding capacity of lanthanum carbonate hydrate having 3 to 6 water molecules is better and quicker than the other hydrates, specifically octahydrate and monohydrate. The patent does not<br><br>
suggest the use of anhydrous lanthanum carbonate in the composition and for the treatment of hyperphosphataemia.<br>
United States Patent 7,381,428 describes the stabilized lanthanum carbonate compositions comprising a monosaccharide or disaccharide as stabilizing agent, and to the treatment of subjects having hyperphosphatemia by administering a pharmaceutical composition containing a therapeutically effective amount of a stabilized lanthanum carbonate. The patent discloses that the lanthanum carbonate has a tendency to degrade to lanthanum hydroxycarbonate due to moisture and heat and can be stabilized using monosaccharide or disaccharide as stabilizer in the composition.<br>
The inventors of the present invention have found that the use of monosaccharides or disaccharides as the stabilizing agent increases the bulk of the formulation as they are to be used in higher amount. The use of higher amount of the excipients leads to the higher tablet weight and for a drug product like lanthanum carbonate having very high dose i.e. 1700mg the tablet weight goes upto 4gm or 5gms. This decreases patient compliance and increases the cost of the formulation.<br>
United States Patent Application 2008/0125394 relates to a continuous slow release oral pharmaceutical compositions of substances capable of binding phosphorus, which when administered during fasting periods provides an improved treatment of hyperphosphatemia by binding the phosphorous secreted in the saliva and other gastric secretions. The patent application does not disclose the use of anhydrous lanthanum carbonate in the immediate release oral pharmaceutical composition.<br>
United States Patent 7,465,465 describes a pharmaceutical formulation in a tablet or in a powder form comprising a pharmaceutically effective amount of a lanthanum compound produced by dry granulation or direct compression process. The patent discloses that with the drugs having a specific hydration status, granulating with water or solvents and drying is not advisable as this can affect the hydration status of the drug.<br>
The prior art as discussed above discloses the use of direct compression and dry granulation for the preparation of tablet formulation comprising lanthanum carbonate to maintain the hydration status of lanthanum carbonate and to avoid decarboxylation. But, the direct compression and dry granulation processes are very difficult for a drug having high proportion in the dosage form.<br><br>
PCT application WO2007/115973 relates to the alimentary or dietary component comprising phosphate binding agents. The patent application does not suggest the use of anhydrous lanthanum carbonate in the composition.<br>
PCT application WO2006/050314 relates to a method for reducing serum phosphate in a subject in need thereof comprising administering once per day to said subject a phosphate binder, wherein the phosphate binder has a phosphate binding capacity of at least 52 mmole. The patent application further relates to a once-per-day phosphate binder formulation that is substantially equivalent to the standard formulation requiring three times per day dosing for controlling serum phosphate.<br>
PCT application WO2006/044657 relates to compositions and formulations of phosphate binders that can be used for the treatment of diseases such as End Stage Renal Disease and Chronic Renal Insufficiency. Specifically, it is directed to compositions comprising lanthanum-based compounds such as lanthanum carbonate hydroxides and lanthanum oxycarbonates, which bind phosphate and can be formulated to provide for a reduced pill burden relative to other phosphate binders. The patent application does not suggest the use of anhydrous lanthanum carbonate in the composition.<br>
PCT application WO2004/016553 relates to rare earth metal compounds of porous nature. The patent application further relates to the method of making the rare earth metal compounds and methods of using said rare earth metal compounds. The patent application specifically relates to the lanthanum oxychloride, anhydrous lanthanum oxycarbonate, and hydrated lanthanum oxycarbonate having porous structure and improved phosphate binding capacity. The patent application does not suggest the use of anhydrous lanthanum carbonate in the composition.<br>
PCT application WO2009/118760 relates to stable, solid oral pharmaceutical composition comprising Lanthanum carbonate having more than 6 molecules of water per molecule of lanthanum carbonate and pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or diluents, wherein said carrier or diluent excludes monosaccharide/s or disaccharide/s, such that the composition has comparable in-vitro dissolution profile similar to that of Fosrenol®. The patent application discloses the use of various other diluents such as microcrystalline cellulose in the composition. The patent application does not suggest the use of anhydrous lanthanum carbonate in the composition.<br><br>
Indian patent application IN2475/CHE/2007 relates to stabilized lanthanum carbonate composition comprising lanthanum carbonate in low hydration state having less than 3 molecules of water and aminoacid as diluent/stabilizer. The application discloses the stabilized high drug loaded pharmaceutical composition comprising lanthanum carbonate in low hydration state having less than three molecules of water and aminoacid as diluent/stabilizer. The applicant discloses the use of aminoaxids as the essential component i.e. diluent or stabilizer for getting the stabilized lanthanum carbonate composition. There is no enabled disclosure for lanthanum carbonate composition without the use of aminoacid as diluent/stabilizer.<br>
Lanthanum carbonate has a tendency to degrade to lanthanum hydroxycarbonate and lanthanum oxycarbonates. This process is accelerated by moisture and heat. There is a need in the art to prevent this degradation because current regulatory requirements preclude detectable decarboxylated products of lanthanum carbonate for administration to patients.<br>
There exists an unmet need of stabilized pharmaceutical formulation comprising anhydrous lanthanum carbonate and pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and/or excipients.<br>
The inventors of present invention have surprisingly found that Lanthanum Carbonate formulation can be stabilized without the use of monosaccharide or disaccharide or amino acids which is substantially free of lanthanum hydroxycarbonate or other related impurities in the final formulation.<br>
SUMMARY:<br>
The present invention relates to a stable pharmaceutical formulation comprising a therapeutically effective amount of anhydrous lanthanum carbonate and pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and/or excipients, with the proviso that the said formulation is substantially free of monosaccharides or disaccharides. The stable pharmaceutical formulation of said invention is also substantially free of amino acids and/or stabilizers.<br>
The present invention also relates to processes for the preparation of anhydrous lanthanum carbonate as well as for the pharmaceutical formulation comprising this anhydrous lanthanum carbonate.<br>
Further, it relates to use of this formulation for the treatment of a disease or disorder in a subject in need thereof comprising administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of the formulation of the present invention.<br><br>
The formulation of present invention is such that it contains anhydrous lanthanum carbonate as an active ingredient instead of the hydrated lanthanum carbonate of the marketed product Fosrenol®, but still has higher stability, comparable dissolution profile &amp; higher in vitro phosphate binding capacity in contrast to the belief in the art that it is not possible to have such a stable &amp; efficacious formulation using anhydrous lanthanum carbonate.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS:<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The present invention refates to a sta6fe pharmaceutic  formulation comprising anhydrous lanthanum carbonate and pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and/or excipients. The present invention relates to a stable pharmaceutical formulation comprising anhydrous lanthanum carbonate and pharmaceutically  acceptable carrier and/or excipients, with the proviso that the said formulation is substantially free of monosaccharides or disaccharides.<br>
The present invention further relates to the stable pharmaceutical formulation comprising anhydrous lanthanum carbonate and pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and/or excipients, with the proviso that said formulation are substantially free of monosaccharides or disaccharides, wherein the formulation is prepared by wet granulation.<br>
The present invention further relates to the stable pharmaceutical formulation comprising anhydrous lanthanum carbonate and pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and/or excipients, with the proviso that said formulation is substantially free of monosaccharides or disaccharides, wherein the formulation is prepared by wet granulation.<br>
The present invention further relates to the stable pharmaceutical formulation comprising anhydrous lanthanum carbonate and pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and/or excipients, with the proviso that said formulation is substantially free of monosaccharides or disaccharides, wherein the composition is substantially free of aminoacid.<br><br>
The present invention further relates to the stable pharmaceutical formulation comprising anhydrous lanthanum carbonate and pharmaceutically  acceptable carrier and/or excipients, with the proviso that said formulation is substantially free of monosaccharides or disaccharides, wherein the composition is substantially free of stabilizer.<br>
Prior arts as discussed above discloses the lanthanum carbonate compositions with the use of aminoacid and stabilizers which contributes to the total weight of the formulation and thus increases the total weight of the composition. Inventors of the present invention have found a stable lanthanum carbonate formulation comprising anhydrous lanthanum carbonate which is substantially free of stabilizer and aminoacid. The moisture content of the stabilizers and aminoacid or the hydrophilic behavior of the stabilizers and aminoacid can affect the stability of the lanthanum carbonate in the formulation. The use of anhydrous lanthanum carbonate in the composition which is substantially free of stabilizers and aminoacid helps in achieving the stable formulation and the total weight of the formulation is also reduced leading to increased patient compliance and reduced cost because of smaller dosage form.<br>
The present invention further relates to the stable pharmaceutical formulation comprising anhydrous lanthanum carbonate and pharmaceutically  acceptable carrier and/or excipients, with the proviso that said formulation is substantially free of monosaccharides or disaccharides, wherein the total weight of the formulation is less than 60% of the total weight of the marketed formulation of lanthanum carbonate (Fosrenol®).<br>
The present invention further relates to the stable pharmaceutical formulation comprising anhydrous lanthanum carbonate and pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and/or excipients, wherein the formulation comprises atleast 65% w/w of anhydrous lanthanum carbonate, with the proviso that said formulation is substantially free of monosaccharides or disaccharides.<br>
Prior art discloses lanthanum carbonate tablet formulation having 10-40% of elemental lanthanum and having the tablet weight ranging between lgm for 250mg strength to 4.2gms for l000mg strength. The higher tablet weight decreases the patient compliance and also increases the cost of the tablet because of the use of high amount of excipients.<br>
The present invention further relates to the stable pharmaceutical formulation comprising anhydrous lanthanum carbonate and pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and/or excipients, wherein the formulation comprises atleast 65% w/w of anhydrous lanthanum carbonate, with<br><br>
the proviso that said formulation is substantially free of monosaccharides or disaccharides, wherein the composition is substantially free of aminoacid.<br>
The present invention further relates to the stable pharmaceutical formulation comprising anhydrous lanthanum carbonate and pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and/or excipients, wherein the formulation comprises atleast 65% w/w of anhydrous lanthanum carbonate, with the proviso that said formulation is substantially free of monosaccharides or disaccharides, wherein the composition is substantially free of stabilizer.<br>
The present invention further relates to the stable pharmaceutical formulation comprising anhydrous lanthanum carbonate and pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and/or excipients, wherein the formulation comprises atleast 65% w/w of anhydrous lanthanum carbonate, with the proviso that said formulation is substantially free of monosaccharides or disaccharides, wherein the total weight of the formulation is less than 60% of the total weight of the marketed formulation of lanthanum carbonate (Fosrenol®).<br>
The present invention further relates to the stable pharmaceutical formulation comprising anhydrous lanthanum carbonate and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and/or excipients, wherein the formulation comprises anhydrous lanthanum carbonate and binder in the ratio of 4:1 to 70:1 w/w.<br>
The inventors of the present invention have found that the ratio of anhydrous lanthanum carbonate and binder is very critical for getting good quality product i.e. less friable and stable formulation of anhydrous lanthanum carbonate. For a drug having high dose the selection of binders and the ratio of drug to binder significantly affects the strength of the formulation. The inventors of the present invention have found that the use of anhydrous lanthanum carbonate and binder in the ratio of 4:1 to 70:1 w/w provides the formulation with higher strength, lesser friability, and improved stability.<br>
The present invention also relates to a premix composition comprising anhydrous lanthanum carbonate and pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and/or excipients. The present invention further relates to a premix composition comprising anhydrous lanthanum carbonate and pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and/or excipients with the proviso that the said composition is substantially free of monosaccharide or disaccharide.<br>
The present invention also relates to a premix composition comprising anhydrous lanthanum carbonate and pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and/or excipients, wherein the composition<br><br>
comprises atleast 65% w/w of anhydrous lanthanum carbonate, with the proviso that said composition is substantially free of monosaccharides or disaccharides.<br>
The present invention further relates to a pharmaceutical formulation comprising a premix composition and pharmaceutically acceptable external excipients wherein the formulation comprises atleast 65% w/w of the premix composition.<br>
Inventors of the present invention have found that the preparation of lanthanum carbonate formulation with prior art method requires large amount of excipients to form a stable dosage form. The dosage form prepared by the prior art methods provide coarser particles of the lanthanum carbonate which leads to segregation of particles during the dry mixing before compression. The coarser particles also lead to the slower phosphate binding as compared to the finer or porous particles. Inventors of the present invention have found that the anhydrous lanthanum carbonate formulation prepared by the process of the present invention provides lanthanum carbonate particles of lesser bulk density and of porous nature, resulting in increased surface area and hence faster phosphate binding.<br>
Inventors of the present invention have surprisingly found that the reaction temperature condition is the critical parameter for getting the desired hydration levels of lanthanum carbonate and the stirring conditions during the reaction is the critical parameter for achieving the desired particle size of lanthanum carbonate.<br>
Anhydrous lanthanum carbonate particles according to the present invention are prepared by simple chemical reaction process under the controlled temperature and stirring conditions. Anhydrous lanthanum carbonate particles of the present invention are prepared by reacting lanthanum chloride with sodium carbonate under constant stirring at about 1-1000 rpm and at the temperature range of about -10 to 20°C. Inventors of the present invention have found that the reaction conducted at -10 to 20°C and with the constant stirring at about 1-1000 rpm results in anhydrous lanthanum carbonate particles with lower bulk density and hence faster phosphate binding due to increased surface area too.<br>
The bulk density of the resulting anhydrous lanthanum carbonate ranges between 0.05 to 0.5 g/ml, preferably 0.1 to 0.3 g/ml.<br>

In an aspect, the present invention also relates to a stable pharmaceutical formulation comprising a therapeutically effective amount of anhydrous  lanthanum  carbonate and<br><br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and/or excipients, with the proviso that the said formulation does not contain monosaccharides or disaccharides.<br>
The anhydrous lanthanum carbonate formed from the reaction of reactants produces anhydrous lanthanum carbonate in the dispersion. The particle size of the anhydrous lanthanum carbonate in the dispersion phase ranges from l00nm to 100 μm<br>
Inventors of the present invention have surprisingly found that the selection of surface stabilizer and the ratio of reactants to surface stabilizer, during dispersion stage greatly affect the particle size of the anhydrous lanthanum carbonate in dispersion phase and the bulk density of the powder. Use of surface stabilizer during the dispersion phase prevents aggregation of particles at dispersion phase and granulation. It further reduces the bulk density of the powder and thereby providing more surface area for rapid binding of phosphate ions.<br>
It is found that the use of reactants to surface stabilizer ratio ranging from 0.3:1 to 300:1 in the dispersion phase results in more uniform and stable dispersion of the lanthanum carbonate. The use of the specific ratio of reactants to surface stabilizer also results in the porous particles of the anhydrous lanthanum carbonate in the granules and hence increases the surface area for phosphate binding.<br>
In yet another aspect the stable pharmaceutical formulation of the present invention results in faster phosphate binding. The phosphate ions released from the food product will bind immediately with the lanthanum ions resulting in less chance of phosphate ions getting absorbed in the blood.<br>

In the present invention, the granulation step results in particles that are free flowing and have good characteristics for tableting. The term "free flowing" means ease of handling as in, for example, measuring, introducing into packages, or feeding into tableting or encapsulating equipment. Free flowing materials exhibit low cohesion and have the ability to keep moving consistently under the force of gravity without any applied agitation.<br>
Flow properties of a formulation may be evaluated by a number of methods known in the art. One way of characterizing formulation properties of a powdered material is by bulk density measurements. Carr's Compressibility Index is a simple test to evaluate flowability by comparing both the initial and final (tapped) bulk volumes and the rate of packing down.<br>
Compressibility Index (%) - [(tapped density-initial density)/tapped density]Х 100<br>
Granules prepared in the present invention, have a Carr's Compressibility Index of less than about 35%; more preferably less than about 30%; even more preferably less than about 25%.<br>
The Hausner ratio is defined in the Metals Handbook, Vol. 7, 9th Ed. p. 285 (1984) as the tap density divided by the bulk density where the densities are in common units of measure. The Hausner ratio is a number that is correlated to the flowability of a powder or granular material.<br>
The granules prepared in present invention have a Hausner ratio of less than 1.35, preferably less than 1.25.<br>
The tablets prepared from the granulation of the present invention exhibit acceptable physical characteristics including good friability and hardness. The resistance of a tablet to chipping, abrasion, or breakage under conditions of storage and transportation depends on its friability. The desired hardness may vary, depending on factors such as tablet size and shape.<br><br>
The lanthanum carbonate formulation can be orally administered to subjects in accordance with this invention in dosage forms varying from about 125 to about 2000 mg lanthanum carbonate as elemental lanthanum per meal. A typical dosage for an adult can be, e.g., 375 mg-6000 mg daily. More preferably, the dosage is 375-3750 mg/day. The dose can be divided and taken with each meal, for example a 250, S00, 750, or 1000 mg elemental lanthanum per tablet, e.g., three times per day. Serum plasma levels can be monitored weekly and dosages can be modified until an optimal serum phosphate level is reached. Administration may be conducted in an uninterrupted regimen; such a regimen may be a long term regimen, e.g., a permanent regimen, for treating chronic conditions.<br>
The lanthanum carbonate formulations can be orally administered, for example, in the form of tablets, capsules, chewable formulations, or the like. Frequently, due to their renal problems, subjects with hyperphosphatemia need to limit their liquid intake. Therefore, a lanthanum carbonate formulation that can be taken with no or limited amounts of liquid is desirable. For example, a lanthanum carbonate formulation, in the form of, e.g., beads, chewed or crushed tablets, powder, or sieved granules, may be sprinkled on food.<br>
It will be understood that the type of lanthanum carbonate formulation and the duration of the treatment will vary depending on the requirements for treatment of individual subjects. The precise dosage regimen will be determined by the attending physician or veterinarian who will, inter alia, consider factors such as body weight, age a nd specific symptoms. The physician or veterinarian may titrate the dosage of lanthanum carbonate administered to a subject to determine the correct dosage for treatment. For example, a physician can measure phosphate levels in a patient, prescribe a particular lanthanum carbonate dosage to the patient for a week, and evaluate after the week if the dosage is appropriate by remeasuring phosphate levels in the patient.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition of the present invention can be administered to the animals, including companion animals in an amount effective to mitigate hyperphosphatemia.<br>

G exhibits comparative release with the marketed formulation and formulation F is exhibiting<br>
faster dissolution than that of the marketed lanthanum carbonate preparation (Fosrenol®).<br>
Example-6<br>
Comparative phosphate binding studies: Example 1, formulations G of Table-7 and<br>
Fosrenol®<br><br>
The anhydrous lanthanum carbonate of example 1 and tablet formulation G of table-7 were compared with the marketed lanthanum carbonate formulation (Fosrenol®) for phosphate binding capacity.<br>
Procedure: Standard stock solution of Phosphate ions was prepared with final concentration of 50 mg/L of phosphate ion. At 0 time point weighed quantity of lanthanum carbonate powder from different formulations (all passed through 100 mesh) were added to Phosphate ion solution under stirring condition. Lanthanum binding to phosphate ions was allowed for 1, 3, 5, 10, 30, and 60 minutes. After stipulated time intervals free phosphate ions were measured using Quantofix® Phosphate Kit. Table-9<br><br>
