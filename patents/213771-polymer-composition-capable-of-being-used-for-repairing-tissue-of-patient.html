				<td>POLYMER COMPOSITION CAPABLE OF BEING USED FOR REPAIRING<br>
TISSUE OF PATIENT<br><br>
BACKGROUND  OF THE  INVENTION<br>
(a)	Field of the  Invention<br>
The invention relates to a polymer composition capable of being used for repairing tissue of patient, and method of its application to improve the repair and to regenerate cartilaginous  tissues   and other tissues  including  without limitation     meniscus,      ligament,      tendon,      bone,      skin, cornea,   periodontal   tissues,    abscesses,   resected  tumors,<br>
and ulcers.<br>
(b)	Description of Prior Art<br>
1), The Cartilage Repair Problem:<br>
Cartilage: Structure, Function, Development, Pathology<br>
Articular cartilage covers the ends of bones in diarthroidial joints in order to distribute the forces of locomotion to underlying bone structures while simultaneously providing nearly frictionless articulating interfaces. These properties are furnished by the extracellular matrix composed of collagen types II and other minor collagen components and a high content of the proteoglycan aggrecan. In general, the fibrillar collagenous network resists tensile and shear forces while the highly charged aggrecan resists compression and interstitial fluid flow. The low friction properties are the result of a special molecular composition of the articular surface and of the synovial fluid as well as exudation of interstitial fluid during loading onto the articular surface (Ateshian, 1997; Higaki et al., 1997; Schwartz and Hills, 1998).<br>
Articular cartilage is formed during the development of long bones following the condensation of prechondrocytic mesenchymal cells and induction of a phenotype switch from predominantly collagen type I to collagen type II and aggrecan (Hall, 1983; Pechak et al., 1986). Bone is formed from cartilage when chondrocytes<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
hypertrophy and switch to type X collagen expression, accompanied   by   blood   vessel   invasion,   matrix calcification,  the appearance of osteoblasts and bone matrix  production.  In  the  adult,  a  thin  layer  of articular cartilage remains on the ends of bones and is sustained by chondrocytes through synthesis, assembly and turnover  of  extracellular  matrix  (Kuettner,  1992) . Articular cartilage disease arises when fractures occur due to physical trauma or when a more gradual erosion, as is characteristic of many forms of arthritis, exposes subchondral  bone  to  create  symptomatic  joint  pain (McCarty and Koopman,  1993).  In addition to articular cartilage, cartilaginous tissues remain in the adult at several body sites such as the ears and nose, areas that are often subject to reconstructive surgery.<br>
2) Cartilage Repair: The Natural Response<br>
Articular cartilage has a limited response to injury in the adult mainly due to a lack of vascularisation and the presence of a dense proteoglycan rich extracellular matrix (Newman, 1998; Buckwalter and Mankin, 1997; Minas and Nehrer, 1997). The former inhibits the appearance of inflammatory and pluripotential repair cells, while the latter emprisons resident chondrocytes in a matrix non-conducive to migration. However, lesions that penetrate the subchondral bone create a conduit to the highly vascular bone allowing for the formation of a fibrin clot that traps cells of bone and marrow origin in the lesion leading to a granulation tissue. The deeper portions of the granulation tissue reconstitute the subchondral bone plate - while the upper portion transforms into a fibrocartilagenous repair tissue. This tissue can temporarily possess the histological appearance of hyaline cartilage although not its mechanical properties<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
(Wei et al., 1997) and is therefore unable to withstand the  local  mechanical  environment  leading  to  the appearance of degeneration before the end of the first year post-injury. Thus the natural response to repair in adult  articular  cartilage  is  that  partial  thickness lesions have no repair response  (other than cartilage flow and  localized  chondrocyte  cloning)  while  full-thickness lesions with bone penetration display a limited and failed response. Age, however, is an important factor since  full  thickness  lesions  in  immature  articular cartilage heal better than in the adult (DePalma et al., 1966; Wei et al., 1997) and superficial lacerations in fetal articular cartilage heal completely in one month without any involvement of vasculature or bone-derived cells (Namba et al., 1998).<br>
3) Current Approaches for Assisted Cartilage Repair<br>
Current clinical treatments for symptomatic cartilage defects involve techniques aimed at: 1) removing surface irregularities by shaving and debridement 2) penetration of subchondral bone by drilling, fracturing or abrasion to augment the natural repair response described above (i.e. the family of bone-marrow stimulation techniques) 3) joint realignment or osteotomy to use remaining cartilage for articulation 4) pharmacological modulation 5) tissue transplantation and 6) cell transplantation (Newman, 1998; Buckwalter and Mankin, 1997) . Most of these methods have been shown to have some short term benefit in reducing symptoms (months to a few years) , while none have been able to consistently demonstrate successful repair of articular lesions after the first few years. The bone marrow-stimulation techniques of shaving, debridement, drilling, fracturing and abrasion athroplasty permit temporary relief  from  symptoms  but  produce  a  sub-functional<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
fibrocartilagenous tissue that is eventually degraded. Pharmacological modulation supplying growth factors to defect sites can augment natural repair but to date insufficiently so (Hunziker and Rosenberg, 1996; Sellers et al. , 1997) . Allograft and autograft osteochondral tissue transplants containing viable chondrocytes can effect a more successful repair but suffer from severe donor limitations (Mahomed et al., 1992; Outerbridge et al., 1995).<br>
4) Bone-Marrow Stimulation<br>
The family of bone marrow-stimulation techniques include debridement,  shaving,  drilling, microfracturing and  abrasion  arthroplasty.  They  are  currently  used extensively in  orthopaedic clinical practice  for the treatment of focal lesions of articular cartilage that are full-thickness, i.e. reaching the subchondral bone, and are limited in size, typically less than 3cm2 in area. Use of these procedures was initiated by Pridie and others (Pridie, 1959; Insall, 1967; DePalma et al., 1966) who reasoned that a blood clot could be formed in the region of an articular cartilage lesion by violating the cartilage/bone interface to induce bleeding from the bone into  the  cartilage  defect  that  is  avascular.  This hematoma could then initiate the classical cascade of wound healing events that leads to successful healing or at least scarring in wounds  of vascularized tissues (Clark,  1996).  Variations  of  the  Pridie  drilling technique  were  proposed  later  including  abrasion arthroplasty (Childers and Ellwood, \ 1979; Johnson, 1991) and microfracturing (Rodrigo et al., 1993; Steadman et al.,   1997).   Abrasion  arthroplasty  uses  motorised instruments to grind away abnormally dense subchondral bone to reach a blood supply in the softer deeper bone. The microfracture technique uses a pick, or an awl, to<br><br>
-5 -<br>
pierce the subchondral bone plate deep enough (typically 3-4 mm), again to reach a vascular supply and create a blood clot inside the cartilage lesion. Practitioners of the microfracture technique claim to observe a higher success rate than drilling due to the lack of any heat-induced necrosis and less biomechanical destabilisation of the  subchondral bone plate with numerous  smaller fracture  holes  rather than large  gaps in  the  plate producing  by  drilling  (Steadman  et  al.,  1998).  Yet another related technique for treating focal lesions of articular  cartilage  is  mosaicplasty  or  osteochondral autograft  transplantation  (OATS)  where  cartilage/bone cylinders  are transferred from a peripheral  "unused" region of a joint to the highly loaded region containing the cartilage lesion (Hangody et al., 1997).<br>
There  ¦ is   no   universal   consensus   among orthopaedists on which type of articular cartilage lesion should receive which type of treatment. There is also a lack of rigorous scientific studies that demonstrate the efficacy of these treatments for particular indications. Thus the choice of treatment for cartilage lesions is largely  dependent  on  the  training,  inclinations  and personal experience of the practitioner. Reasons for this lack  of  consensus  are  multifold  but  include  the variability in the type of lesion treated and a variable if not uncontrolled success in the formation of a "good quality" blood clot. Some of the problems associated with forming a good quality blood clot with these procedures are 1) the uncontrolled nature of the bleeding coming from the bone, which never fills up the cartilage lesion entirely 2) platelet mediated clot contraction occurring within minutes of clot formation reduces clot size and could detach it from surrounding cartilage (Cohen et al., 1975) 3) dilution of the bone blood with synovial fluid or circulating arthroscopy fluid and 4) the fibrinolytic<br><br>
_ 6 _<br>
or clot dissolving activity of synovial fluid (Mankin, 1974). Some of these issues were the motivation behind some studies where a blood clot was formed ex vivo and then cut to size and packed into a meniscal defect   (Arnoczky  et  al.,  1988)  or  an  osteochondral  defect (Palette  et  al.,  1992) .  Something  similar  to  the classical  wound healing  cascade  then  ensued  to  aid healing of the defect. This approach did clearly provide more filling of the defect with repair tissue, however the quality of the repair  tissue was generally not acceptable, being predominantly fibrous and mechanically insufficient.  Some probable  reasons  for a  less  than satisfactory repair tissue with this approach are 1) continued platelet mediated clot contraction 2) the lack of viability of some blood components due to extensive ex vivo manipulation and 3) the solidification of the clot ex vivo which precludes good adhesion to all tissue surfaces  surrounding the cartilage  defect  and limits defect filling. In summary, current clinical procedures practised by orthopaedists for treating focal lesions of articular cartilage mostly depend on the formation of a blood clot within the lesion. However the ability to form a good quality blood clot that fills the lesion and contains  all  of  the  appropriate  elements  for  wound healing (platelets, monocytes, fibrin network etc) in a viable   state   produces   inconsistent   and   often unsatisfactory outcomes. One of the embodiments of the present invention ameliorates this situation by providing a composition and method for delivering these blood borne wound healing elements in a full-volume non-contracting matrix to an articular cartilage lesion.<br>
5) Biomaterials and Growth Factors<br>
Several   experimental   techniques   have   been proposed to repair cartilage lesions using biomaterials<br><br>
- 7 -<br>
and growth factors,  sometimes each alone but often in combination. The analogy with the above-described family of  bone-marrow  stimulation  techniques  is  clear.  The fibrin scaffold of the blood clot could be replaced with a prefabricated biomaterial scaffold and the natural mitogenic and chemotactic factors in the blood clot could be replaced with user-controlled quantities and species of soluble elements such as recombinant growth factors. Examples of this approach include the use of fibrin glues to deliver recombinant proteins such as insulin-like-growth factors  {Nixon et al. ,  1999}  and transforming growth  factors  (Hunziker  and  Rosenberg,  1996).  Other biologies have been combined with generic biomaterials such as polylactic acid (PLA) , polyglycolic acid {PGA}, collagen  matrices  and  fibrin  glues  including  bone morphogenetic proteins  {Sellers et al.,  1997; Sellers, 2000;   Zhang  et  al.   Patent  WO  00/44413,   2000), angiotensin-like peptides  {Rodgers and Dizerega, Patent WO 00/02905, 2000), and extracts of bone containing a multiplicity of proteins  called bone  proteins  or BP (Atkinson,  Patent  WO  00/48550,  2000).  In  the  latter method/ BP soaked collagen sponges needed to be held in the cartilage defect using an additional fibrin/thrombin based adhesive, creating a rather complex and difficult to  reproduce  wound  healing  environment.  Coating  the biomaterial with fibronectin or RGD peptides to aid cell adhesion and cell migration has been done (Breckke and Coutts, US Patent 6,005,161, 1999). Some previous methods have combined bone-marrow stimulation with post-surgical injection of growth hormone in the synovial space with ' limited success  (Dunn and Dunn,  US  Patent  5,368,051, 1994). Specific biomaterials compositions have also been proposed  such as mixtures  of  collagen,  chitosan and glycoaminoglycans (Collombel et al., US Patent 5,166,187, 1992; Suh et al. , Patent WO 99/47186, 1999) , a crushed<br><br>
- 8 -<br>
cartilage and bone paste  (Stone,  US Patent 6,110,209, 2000),   a   multicomponent   collagen-based   construct (Pahcence et al., US Patent 6,080,194, 2000) and a curable chemically reactive methacrylate-based resin (Braden et al., US Patent 5,468/787, 1995). None of these approaches has reached the clinic due to their inability to overcome some of the following problems 1) lack of retention and adherence of the biomaterial in the cartilage defect 2) lack  of  sustained release  of  active  forms  of these molecules  at  effective  concentrations  over  prolonged periods of time 3) multiple and uncontrolled biological activities of the delivered molecules 4) cytotoxicity of acidic   degradation   products   of   PGA   and   PLA   5) inappropriate degradation  kinetics  or immunogencity of the carrier biomaterial and 6)  undesirable systemic or ectopic affects (calcification of organs) of the active biologies.   The  successful  implementation  of  these approaches awaits the solution to some or all of these issues.<br>
6) Cell Transplantation<br>
Techniques involving cell transplantation have provoked much recent interest due to their ability to enhance cartilage repair by introducing into articular defects, after ex vivo passaging and manipulation, large numbers of autologous chondrocytes (Grande et al., 1989; Brittberg et al., 1994 and 1996; Breinan et al., 1997), allogenic chondrocytes (Chesterman and Smith, 1968; Bently and Greer, 1971; Green, 1977; Aston and Bently, 1986; Itay et al., 1987; Wakatini et al., 1989; Robinson et al., 1990; Freed et al., 1994; Noguchi et al., 1994; Hendrickson et al., 1994; Kandel et al., 1995; Sams and Nixon, 1995; Specchia et al., 1996; Frankel et al., 1997; Hyc et al. 1997; Kawamura et al., 1998), xenogenic chondrocytes (Homminga et al., 1991), perichondrial cells<br><br>
- 9 -<br>
(Chu et al., 1995; Chu et al., 1997), or autogenic and allogenic  bone  marrow-derived  mesenchymal  stem  cells (Wakatini et al., 1994; Butnariu-Ephrat, 1996; Caplan et al. , 1997; Nevo et al., 1998) . The cell transplantation approach possesses some potential advantages over other cartilage repair tecniques in that they 1)  minimise additional cartilage and bone injury, 2) reduce reliance on donors by ex vivo cell production,  3)  could mimic natural biological processes of cartilage development, and 4) may provide tailored cell types to execute better repair. One technique using autologous chondrocytes is in the public domain and is commercially available having been used in several thousand US and Swedish patients (http://www.genzyme.com). In this technique chondrocytes are  isolated  from a  cartilage  biopsy  of  a  non-load bearing area, proliferated during several weeks, and re-introduced into the cartilage lesion by injection under a sutured and fibrin-sealed periosteal patch harvested from the patient's tibia. Knowledge of its efficacy has been questioned (Messner and Gillquist, 1996; Brittberg, 1997; Newman, 1998) and is unfortunately not known due to the lack of completion of an FDA requested controlled and randomised clinical trial. Recent animal studies indicate that  the  injected  passaged  autologous  chondrocytes contribute very little to the observed healing and that the outcome is similar to that obtained using bone-marrow stimulation  (Breinan et al. ,  1997 and Breinan et al. , 2000) . Thus the surgical preparation of the defect could be the main factor inducing repair, in this procedure as well. Nonetheless, due to the enormous potential benefit of cell transplantation, a large number of patents have been granted in the past two years to protect aspects of autologous chondrocyte processing (Tubo et al., US Patent 5,723,331, 1998; Villeneuve, US Patent 5,866,415, 1999) , as well as the use and preparation of adipocytes (Mueller<br><br>
- 10 -<br>
and Thaler, US Patent 5,837,235, 1998; Halvorsen et al., Patent EP 1  077 253,  2001),  hematopoeitic precursors (Peterson and Nousek-Goebl, US Patent 6,200,606, 2001), amniotic membrane cells (Sackier, 1997) , mesenchymal stem cells (Caplan and Haynesworth, US Patent 5,811,094, 1998; Naughton and Naughton, Patent US 5,785,964, 1998; Naughton and Willoughby, US Patent 5,842,477, 1998; Grande and Lucas, US Patent 5,906,934, 1999; Johnstone and Yoo, US Patent 5,908,784,   1999) ,   and   general   techniques   using chondrocytes/fibroblasts    and    their    progenitors, epithelial  cells,   adipocytes,   placental  cells  and umbilical cord blood ceils  (Purchio et al.,  US Patent 5,902,741, 1999), all for use in cartilage repair.<br>
7) The Cell Delivery Problem<br>
Cell  transplantation  for  assisted  cartilage repair necessarily involves a technique to deliver and retain viable and functional transplanted cells at the site of injury. When cells are grown ex vivo with or without a support matrix, press-fitting may be used by preparing an implant that is slightly larger than the defect and forcing it therein (Aston and Bentley 1986; Wakatini et al., 1989; Freed et al., 1994; Chu et al., 1997;  Frankel et al.,  1997;  Kawamura et  al.,  1998). Press-fitting necessitates the use of a tissue that is formed ex vivo and thus not optimised for the geometric, physical, and biological factors of the site in which it is implanted.  Suturing or tacking the implant can aid retention  (Sams and Nixon,  1995)  although sutures are known to be an additional injury to the articular surface inducing yet another limited repair process (Breinan et al.,  1997).  Biological glues have been attempted with limited success {Kandel et al., 1995; Jurgenson et al., 1997). When the implant is not amenable to press fitting, such as with contracting collagen gels or fibrin clots,<br><br>
_ 1 1 _<br>
implanted, often a sutured patch of periosteum or another similar tissue is used to retain the implant material within the defect site (Grande et al., 1989; Brittberg et al., 1994; Grande et al., 1989; Brittberg et al., 1996; Breinan et al., 1997). Such a technique may benefit from an ability of  the periosteum to stimulate cartilage formation (O'Driscoll et al., 1988 and 1994), but suffers again from the introduction of sutures and the complex nature of the operation involving periosteal harvesting and arthrotomy. Cells have also been delivered to deep full thickness defects using a viscous hyaluronic acid solution (Robinson et al., 1990; Butnariu-Ephrat, 1996). As with cell sources for cartilage repair, there are several - recently published patents for delivery vehicles in cartilage repair ranging from gel matrices (Griffith et al., 1998; Caplanet al., 1999), to sutures and fibres (Vacant! et al. ,  1998; Vacant! and Langer,  1998a and 1998b) ,  to  screw  type  devices  (Schwartz,  1998),  and magnetic  systems  (Halpern,  1997).  Taking together the above,  current cell delivery techniques for cartilage repair are clearly not optimal. A desirable cell delivery vehicle would be a polymeric solution loaded with cells which solidifies when in j ected into the defect site, adheres and fills the defect, and provides a temporary biodegradable   scaffold   to   permit   proper   cell differentiation  and the synthesis  and assembly of a dense,   mechanically  functional  articular  cartilage extracellular matrix.<br>
8) Repair of other tissues including meniscus, ligament, tendon, bone, skin, cornea, periodontal tissues, abscesses, resected tumours, and ulcers<br>
Natural and assisted repair of musculoskeletal and other tissues are very broad fields with numerous complex biological processes and a wide variety of approaches to accelerate the repair process (as in bone<br><br>
- 12 -<br>
repair), aid it in tissues that have little intrinsic repair capacity (as in cartilage repair) , and to reduce scarring (as in burn treatments) (Clark, 1996) . Although differences certainly occur in the biological elements and processes involved, the global events in (non-fetal) wound repair are identical. These include the formation of a blood clot at the site of tissue disruption, release of chemotactic and mitogenic factors  from platelets, influx of inflammatory cells and pluripotential repair cells, vascularisation, and finally the resolution of the repair process by differentiation of repair cells their synthesis  of  extracellular  matrix  components.  In  a successful  repair  outcome  the  specific local  tissue environment  and  the  specific  local  population  of pluripotential repair cells will lead to the formation of the correct type of tissue, bone to replace bone, skin to replace skin etc. Given the similarity of the general elements  in  the  tissue  repair  process,  it  is  not surprising that approaches to aid repair in one tissue could also have some success in aiding repair in other tissues. This possibility becomes much more likely if the method and  composition to aid repair is based upon augmenting some aspect of the natural wound healing cascade without significantly deviating from this more or less  optimised  sequence  of  events.  In  the  present invention particular composition and methods are proposed to  provide  a  more  effective,  adhesive,  and  non-contracting blood clot at the site of tissue repair. Examples , and  preferred  embodiments  are  shown  for cartilage repair; one of the most difficult tissues to repair. However application of the composition and method o and modifications  thereof,  conserving the' same  basic principles,  to aid repair of other tissues including meniscus,   ligament,   tendon,   bone.,   skin,   cornea,<br><br>
- 13 -<br>
periodontal  tissues,  abscesses,  resected tumours,  and ulcers, are obvious to those who are skilled in the art.<br>
9) Use of Chitosan in Pharmaceuticals, Wound Healing, Tissue Repair and as a Hemostatic agent<br>
Chitosan,  which  primarily  results  from  the alkaline deacetylation of chitin, a natural component of shrimp  and  crab  shells,  is  a . family  of  linear polysaccharides  that  contains  1-4  linked  glucosamdne (predominantly) and N~acetyl-glucosamine monomers (Austin et  al. ,  1981) .  Chitosan  and  its  amino-substituted derivatives    are   pH-dependent,    bioerodible    and biocompatible cationic polymers that have been used in the  biomedical  industry for  wound healing  and  bone induction  (Denuziere et al.,  1998; Muzzarelli et al., 1993 and 1994), drug and gene delivery (Carreno-Gomez and Duncan,  1997; Schipper et al., 1997; Lee et al., 1998; Bernkop-Schnurch and Pasta, 1998) and in scaffolds for cell growth and cell encapsulation {Yagi et al,  1997, Eser Elcin et al., 1998; Dillon et al., 1998; Koyano et al., 1998; Sechriest et al., 2000; Lahiji et al 2000; Sun et al., 2000) . Chitosan is termed a mucoadhesive polymer (Bernkop-Schnurch and Krajicek, 1998) since it adheres to the mucus layer of the gastrointestinal epithelia via ionic and hydrophobic interactions, thereby facilitating peroral  drug  delivery.  Biodegradability  of  chitosan occurs via its susceptibility to enzymatic cleavage by chitinases  (Fukamizo and Brzezinski,  1997),  lysozymes (Sashiwa  et  al.,  1990),  cellulases   (Yalpani  and Pantaleone, 1994), proteases (Terbojevich et al., 1996), and  lipases  (Muzzarelli  et  al.,  1995) .  Recently, chondrocytes have been shown to be capable of expressing chitotriosidase (Vasios et al., 1999), th'e human analogue of chitosanase; its physiological role may be in the degradation  of  hyaluronan,  a  linear  polysaccharide possessing some similarity with, chitosan since it is<br><br>
- 14 -<br>
composed of disaccharides  of N-acetyl-glucosamine  and glucuronic acid.<br>
Chitosan   has   been   proposed   in   various formulations,  alone  and  with  other  components,   to stimulate repair of dermal, corneal and hard tissues in a number  of  reports  (Sail  et  al.,  1987;  Bartone  and Adickes, 1988; Olcamoto et al., 1995; Inui et al., 1995; Shigemasa and Minami, 1996; Ueno et al., 1999; Cho et al-,  1999; Stone et al., 2000; Lee et al., 2000)  and inventions  (Sparkes and Murray, Patent 4,572,906,. 1986; Mosbey,  Patent 4,956,350,  1990; Hansson et al-. Patent 5,894,070, 1999; Gouda and Larm, Patent 5,902,798, 1999; Drohan et  al.,  Patent 6,124,273,  2000;  Jorgensen  WO 98/22114, 1998). The properties of chitosan that are most commonly cited as beneficial for the wound repair process are  its biodegradability,  adhesiveness,  prevention  of dehydration and as a barrier to bacterial invasion. Other properties  that have also been claimed are its  cell activating and chemotractant nature (Peluso et al., 1994; Shigemasa  and Minami,  1996;  Inui  et  al-,  1995)  its hemostatic activity (Malette et al- , 1983; Malette and Quigley, Patent 4,532,134, 1985) and an apparent ability to limit fibroplasia and scarring by promoting a looser type of granulation tissue (Bartone and Adickes,  1988; Stone et al. , 2000) . Although a general consensus about the beneficial effects of chitosan in wound healing is apparent, its exact mechanism of action is not known, nor is the most effective means of its application, i.e. as a powder, suspension, sponge, membrane, solid gel etc. Part of the reason for the ambiguity in its mechanism of action could be that many previous studies used chitosan that  was not chemically defined  (acetyl  content  and distribution, molecular weight) and of unknown purity. . The interesting hemostatic potential of chitosan has also led to its direct application to reduce bleeding at<br><br>
- 15 -<br>
grafts and wound sites (Malette et al., 1983; Malette and Quigley, Patent 4,532,134, 1985). Some studies claim that the hemostatic activity of chitosan derives solely from it's ability to agglutinate red blood cells  (Rao and Sharma, 1997) while others believe its polycationic amine character can activate platelets to release thrombin' and initiate the classical coagulation cascade thus leading to its use as a hemostatic in combination with fibrinogen and purified autologous platelets (Cochrum et al. Patent 5,773,033,  1998).  In  the  context  of  the  present invention, it is important to note in these reports and inventions a complete lack of any example where blood was mixed   with   chitosan   in   solution   and   applied therapeutically  to  aid  tissue  repair  through  the formation of a chitosan containing blot clot at the repair site.<br>
One technical difficulty that chitosan often presents is a low solubility at physiological pH and ionic strength, thereby limiting its use in a solution state. Thus typically, dissolution of chitosan is achieved via the protonation of amine groups in acidic aqueous solutions having a pH ranging from 3.0 to 5.6. Such chitosan solutions remain soluble up to a pH near<br>
6.2	where neutralisation of the amine groups  reduces<br>
interchain electrostatic repulsion and allows attractive<br>
forces of hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic and van der Waals<br>
interactions to cause polymer precipitation at a pH near<br>
6.3	to  6.4.  A  prior  invention  (Chenite  Patent  WO<br>
99/07416; Chenite et al., 2000) has taught that admixing<br>
a polyol-phosphate dibasic salt (i.e. glycerol-phosphate)<br>
to an aqueous solution, of chitosan can increase the pH of<br>
the  solution  while  avoiding  precipitation.  In  the<br>
presence of these particular salts, chitosan solutions of<br>
substantial concentration  (0.5-3%)  and high molecular<br>
weight (&gt; several hundred kDa) remain liquid, at low or<br><br>
  - 16 -<br>
room temperature, for a long period of time with a pH in a physiologically acceptable neutral region between 6.8 and 7.2. This aspect facilitates the mixing of chitosan with cells in a manner that maintains their viability. An additional    important   property    is    that    such chitosan/polyol-phosphate   (C/PP)   aqueous   solutions solidify or gel when heated to an appropriate temperature that allows the mixed chitosan/cell  solutions  to be injected into body sites where, for example cartilage nodules can be formed in subcutaneous spaces in nude mice (Chenite et al., 2000). It is important to note that some other studies have retained chitosan in a soluble state at physiological pH but these studies necessitated the reduction of either chitosan concentration (to 0.1% in Lu et al Biomaterials 1999) or of chitosan molecular weight and  degree  of  deacetylation  (to ' ~350kD  and  50%  in respectively in Cho  et  al  Biomaterials,  1999)  Other studies  have  also  shown  that  chitosan  presents  a microenvironment  that  supports  the  chondrocyte  and osteoblast phenotype (Suh et al., 2000; Lahiji et al., 2000; Seichrist et al., 2000) however these studies were not based on liquid chitosan in a form that could be mixed   with   cells   and   inj ected.    Finally   NN-dicarboxylmethyl chitosan sponges have been soaked with BMP7 and placed into osteochondral defects of rabbits (Mattioli-Belmonte,  1999).  Here  again  some  improved histochemical   and   immunohistochemical   outcome   was observed, however, incomplete filling of the defect with repair tissue and a significant difficulty in retaining the  construct  within  the  defect  appeared  to  be insurmountable problems. The present invention overcomes these issues and'.presents several novel solutions for the delivery of compositions for the repair of cartilage and other tissues.<br><br>

10) Summary of Prior Art<br>
In summary of prior art for assisted cartilage repair, it may be said that many techniques to improve the very limited natural repair response of articular cartilage have been proposed and experimentally tested. Some of these techniques have achieved a certain level' of acceptance in clinical practice but this has mainly been so due to the absence of any practical  and clearly effective  method  of  improving  the  repair  response compared to that found when the family of bone marrow stimulation  techniques  is  applied.  This  invention addresses and solves several of the main problematic issues in the use of cells and blood components to repair articular  cartilage.  One  main  obstacle  towards  the development of an effective cartilage repair procedure is the absence of a composition and method to provide an appropriate macromolecular environment within the space requiring cartilage growth  (cartilage defect or other site requiring tissue bulking or reconstruction).  This macromolecular  environment  or  matrix. should  1)  be amenable  to  loading  with  active  biological  elements (cells, proteins, genes, blood, blood components) in a liquid state 2) then be injectable into the defect site to fill the entire defect or region requiring cartilage growth   3)   present   a   primarily   nonproteinaceous environment  to limit cell adhesion and cell-mediated contraction  of  the matrix,  both  of which  induce  a fibrocytic cellular phenotype (fibrous tissue producing) ¦ rather    than    chondrocytic    cellular    phenotype (cartilaginous  tissue  producing)  and which  can  also disengage the matrix from the walls of the defect 4) be cytocompatible, possessing physiological levels of pH and osmotic pressure and an absence of any cytotoxic elements 5) be degradable but present for a sufficiently long time to allow included biologically active elements to fully<br><br>
- 18 -<br>
reconstitute a cartilaginous tissue capable of supporting mechanical load without degradation. In addition it is obvious to those skilled in the art that such a combination of characteristics . could be applied with minimal modifications towards the repair of other tissues such as meniscus, ligament, tendon, bone, skin, cornea, periodontal tissues, abscesses, resected tumors, and ulcers.<br>
It would be highly desirable to be provided with a new composition for use in repair and regeneration of cartilaginous tissues.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
When combined with blood or blood components the polymer could be in an aqueous solution or in an aqueous suspension,  or in a particulate state,  the essential characteristics of the polymer preparation being that 1) it is mixable with blood or selected components of blood, 2) that the resulting mixture is inj ectable or can be placed at or in a body site that requires tissue repair, regeneration, reconstruction or bulking and 3) that the mixture  has  a  beneficial  effect  on  the  repair, regeneration, reconstruction or bulking of tissue at the site of placement.<br>
A preferred embodiment is  shown  in Example  5 where a solution of the natural polysaccharide, chitosan, was used at a concentration 1.5% w/v and in 0.135 moles/L disodium glycerol phosphate buffer at pH - 6.8.  This solution was mixed with peripheral rabbit blood at a ratio of 1 part polymer solution to 3 parts blood. The polymer/blood mixture was then injected into a surgically prepared articular cartilage defect in the rabbit where it solidified within 5 minutes  (Fig. 22) . Histological observations of the healing process revealed a stimulated repair that resulted in hyaline cartilage after 6-8 weeks (Fig.  24).  Control defects that did not receive the "polymer/blood mixture were incompletely healed or healed with non-functional fibrous or fibrocartilagenous tissue (Fig. 24) . This example demonstrates that the use of a polymer/blood  mixture  can  result  in  more  effective healing and greater functionality of repaired tissue than simply  inducing bleeding at the  wound site.  Trivial modifications of this invention are evident to those skilled in the art. Other polymers and other formulations<br><br>
- 26 -<br>
of polymers or polymer blends may be substituted for the chitosan  solution  providing  they  retain  the  three characteristics  cited in the  previous paragraph.  And clearly, this approach may be trivially applied to the repair of tissues other than cartilage such as meniscus, ligament,   tendon,   bone,   skin,   cornea,  periodontal tissues,   abscesses,   resected  tumors,   and  ulcers. Applications in tissue bulking and reconstruction . are also evident.<br>
We  present  examples  and  evidence  to  teach possible mechanisms of action of this invention including 1)   inhibition   of   the   typical   platelet-mediated contraction of a blood clot by mixing blood with the polymer  prior  to  solidification  (Fig.  17)  2)  the resulting maintained full-volume scaffold and therefore better defect filling for tissue repair  (Fig.  18)  3) adherence of the solidified polymer/blood mixture to the surrounding tissues  (Fig. 22A)  4)  a slower release of chemotactic  and  mitogenic  protein  factors  from  the polymer/blood mixture than from a simple blood clot (Fig. 21) 5) maintenance of leukocyte and platelet viability in the polymer blood/mixture (Fig. 20) and 6) provision of a polysaccharide environment in the repair site that is more conducive to cartilage formation than is a purely proteinaceous  matrix   (Figs  2-6,   8-10,   24) .   These phenomena are demonstrated to occur in our examples. Their  demonstration  does  not,  however,  reject  the possibility that other important events occur such as those involving the kinetics of cellular degradation of the  polymer,  and  binding/concentration  of  endogenous factors by the chitosan.<br>
A second preferred embodiment of this invention is shown in Examples 1 and 2 where a thermogelling chitosan solution was used to deliver primary chondrocytes  to  subcutaneous  regions in mice  or  -to<br><br>
- 27 -<br>
culture chambers in vitro. In this case the absence of blood components necessitates a gelling capability on the part of the chitosan solution alone, and this property is endowed via a particular preparation of the chitosan solution  using  glycerol  phosphate  and  other  similar buffers. In our examples we demonstrate that the polymer solution may be mixed with cells and the polymer/cell solution injected in vivo or in vitro whereupon it gels, maintaining functionality and viability of  the  cells (Figs  1-11) .  The  cells  may  be  resuspended  in  a physiological buffer,  or other cell carrier suspension such as cellulose in an isotonic buffer, prior to mixing with the chitosan solution. We show data demonstrating the formation of cartilage tissue in vitro (Figs 2-6) and in  vivo  (Figs  8-11)  when  primary  chondrocytes  are  inj ected   with   this   polymer   solution.   Trivial modifications and extensions of this embodiment of the invention are also evident to those skilled in the art where,  for example,  other cell types .may be used and concentrations of the chitosan and the buffer may be changed to achieve the same result.<br>
The present invention will be more readily understood by referring to the following examples, which are given to illustrate the invention rather than to limit its scope.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Mixing of thermogelling chitosan solution with primary chondrocytes for in vitro growth of cartilage<br>
Chitosan (0.22g, 85% deacetylated) as an HC1 salt powder was sterilized by exposure to ultraviolet radiation in a biological laminar flow hood and then dissolved in 7.5 ml H20 resulting in a pH near 5.0. D(+)-glucosamine (0.215g, MW 215.6) was dissolved in 10 ml of 0.1M NaOH and filter sterilized using a 22 urn pore size<br><br>
- 28 -<br>
disk filter. Glycerol phosphate (0.8g, MW 297 including 4.5 mole water per mole glycerol phosphate) was dissolved in 2.0 ml of H2O and filter sterilized using a 22pm pore size disk filter. 2.25 ml of the glucosamine solution was added  drop-by-drop  under  sterile  conditions  to  the chitosan solution with agitation at a temperature of 4°C. Then 1 ml of the glycerol phosphate solution was added under the same conditions. This final solution is still a liquid and remains so for an extended period (i.e. days) if the temperature is kept low, i.e. near 4°C. The pH of this solution is physiological at 6-8 and the osmolarity is also physiological, around 376 mOsm/kg-fkO. It is of critical importance to retain these two parameters within the limits required to maintain cell viability.  These limits vary with cell type but are generally 6.6 
The above solution in the liquid state at 4°C was mixed with enzymatically isolated primary chondrocytes<br><br>
- 29 -<br>
(Buschmann et al., 1992) and then poured into a plastic culture dish (Figs. 1A to IF) . In Fig. 1A, a cell pellet is resuspended and admixed (Fig. IB) into the' liquid chitosan gel solution at 4 °C. In Figs. 1C and ID, the liquid solution is poured into a tissue culture petri and allowed to solidify at 37°C for 30 minutes, after which the solid gel with cells is washed with DMEM, and discs cored using a biopsy punch. In Fig. IE, 1000 um pore mesh grids are placed in 48-well plates. In Fig. IF, the chitosan gel discs with cells are placed in culture in individual wells.<br>
A gel harboring cells formed after a 20 minute incubation at 37 °C.  Using a biopsy punch, 6 mm diameter 1 mm thick discs were cored from the gel and placed in culture  for  up  to  3  weeks.  Discs  were  cultured individually  in  48-well  tissue  culture  plates  with sterile nylon 1000 uM meshes beneath to allow media access to all surfaces.   Over 90% of the encapsulated cells were viable immediately after encapsulation,  and throughout the culture period (Figs. 2A to 2C) .  Samples were incubated in calcein AM and ethidium homodimer-1 to reveal  live  (green)  and dead  (red)  cells.    Freshly isolated chondrocytes (Fig. 2A) were encapsulated in the gel,  solidified and tested immediately  for viability (Fig. 2B), or after 20 days of culture in the gel (Fig. 2C) .    Fig.  2C  shows  cells  with typical  chondrocyte morphology from the middle of the gel.<br>
Several distinct cell types exhibited the same high degree of viability after encapsulation and cell culture, including Rat-1, COS, 293T, and de-differentiated bovine articular chondrocytes, confirming that the gelation process maintained cell viability, and could thus be used to deliver cells in vivo by injection. Toluidine blue staining  of the gel with cells after 22 days of culture revealed a metachromatic ring of.staining<br><br>
- 30 -<br>
surrounding encapsulated primary chondrocytes, indicating the build-up of proteoglycan, or GAG, which was beginning to fuse between closely adjacent cells (Fig. 3D). These regions  also  stained  with  antibodies  raised  against aggrecan, type II collagen and link protein. The chitosan gel matrix was also found to bind Toluidine blue (Fig. 3C).  This  property  enabled  to  observe  the  lattice structure  of  the  gel,  after  employing  an  aldehyde fixation.  Interestingly,  the pericellular ring of GAG observed  around  the  chondrocytes  contained  little chitosan matrix,  the  latter  appearing  to  have  been degraded  by  chondrocyte-produced  factors  (Fig.  3D) . Primary calf chondrocytes were encapsulated in chitosan gel at 2xlO7 primary chondrocytes per ml and cultured as 6 mm discs for up to 20 days.  Primary calf chondrocytes were encapsulated and cultured in 2% agarose and analyzed in parallel. Day 0 and day 20. cultures were processed by paraffin  sectioning  and  toluidine  blue  staining  for agarose gel cultures (Figs. 3A and 3B) and chitosan gel cultures (Figs. 3C and 3D).  At day=0, nuclei stain dark blue (Figs. 3A and 3C) whereas accumulated pericellular GAG stains metachromatic blue-violet  (Figs. 3B and 3D, large   arrows).   These   pericellular  ' regions   were immunopositive for aggrecan, collagen (II) and cartilage link protein. At a magnification of 4 OX in Fig.  3E, quantitative biochemical analysis of GAG present at days 0, 14, and 20 of culture using the DMMB assay revealed a similar, accumulation of GAG in chitosan gel compared with agarose gel.<br>
RNA analysis of type II collagen and aggrecan mRNA expressed by the encapsulated chondrocytes revealed high levels at 14 and 22 days of culture (Fig. 4, lanes 4 and 5) that were comparable to those levels observed in articular chondrocytes in cartilage (Fig. 4, lane 6). A mixture of antisense 3ZP-labeled RNA probes complementary<br><br>
- 31 -<br>
to bovine type II collagen, aggrecan, and GAPDH was hybridized with tRNA (lane 1), or total RNA, from bovine kidney {lane 2), from primary chondrocytes (107/ml) cultured in chitosan gel for 0 days {lane 3) 14 days (lane 4) or 20 days (lane 5), or adult bovine articular cartilage (lane 6) . Samples were treated with RNase A and Tl, then submitted to electrophoresis and autoradiography. Protected bands showing the presence of individual transcripts are as indicated. The maintenance of the chondrocyte phenotype in the chitosan/glycerol-phosphate gel is shown by the continued expression of aggrecan and type II collagen.<br>
Western analysis of proteins produced by encapsulated cells showed an accumulation of cartilage matrix link protein between 2 and 3 weeks in culture (Fig. 5) . Total proteins were extracted, separated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with antisera recognizing vimentin, PCNA, the C-propeptide of type II collagen, or cartilage link protein. Samples analyzed include chitosan gel with no cells (lane 1) , bovine kidney (lane 2), duplicate samples of primary chondrocytes (107/ml) cultured in chitosan gel at day=0 (lanes 3 and 4), day-14 (lanes 5 and 6), or day-20 (lanes 7 and 8) , 2-week calf articular cartilage (lane 9), or adult bovine cartilage (lane 10) . 'Results show the accumulation of cartilage-specific proteins CP2 and link at 14 and 20 days, as well as the persistence of PCNA expression through culture day 20, as a marker for cell proliferation.<br>
Discs containing primary bovine articular chondrocytes were mechanically evaluated at days 4 and 13 of culture using uniaxial unconfined compression stress relaxation tests. By comparing to control gels with no cells, a significant, cell-dependent degree of stiffening was observed even at day 4 and became much more dramatic at day 13 (Fig. 6) .  Discs (~5mm diameter) from days 4,<br><br>
- 32 -<br>
13  and  19  of  culture  were  mechanically  tested  in unconfined compression by applying 5 ramps of 10% the disk thickness  (~1.5mm)  during 10 seconds and holding that  displacement  during subsequent  stress  relaxation (the 2nd ramp from 10-20% is shown in the graph). The gel discs without cells displayed a weak behavior while cell-laden gels became evidently stiffer with time in culture and more characteristically viscoelastic, like articular cartilage.<br>
By  analyzing  these  data  with  a  composite poroelastic model (Soulhat et al., 1999) a doubling of the non-fibrillar matrix modulus {2.5-&gt;5kPa) was found, a 5x increase in the fibrillar matrix modulus (100-&gt;500kPa) was also found together with a near lOOx reduction in hydraulic permeability (5-&gt;0.08 x 10-12 N-s/m4)  due to the presence of primary chondrocytes in these gels during only 13 days of culture in vitro. Taken together, these results   demonstrate   that   the   chitosan   gel   is cytocompatible   and   cytodegradable,   conducive   to maintenance of the chondrocyte phenotype, and permits the elaboration of a neo-cartilage matrix with a significant increase in mechanical stiffness in vitro.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Mixing of thermogelling chitosan solution with primary chondrocytes and subcutaneous injection for In vivo<br>
growth of cartilage<br>
To demonstrate that this in situ gelling system can be employed in animals, athymic mice (CD1 nu/nu) were subjected to dorsal, subcutaneous injections of 100 to 300 ul of chitosan gel described in Example 1, containing 10 million calf articular chondrocytes per ml (Fig. 7). A cell pellet of primary calf chondrocytes was admixed with liquid chitosan gel at 4 °C to achieve a concentration of 1 to 2 x 107 cells/ml, and injected in liquid form as 100<br><br>
- 33 -<br>
ul subcutaneous dorsal implants in anesthetized nude mice. In situ gelling was apparent by palpation 5 to 10 minutes post-injection.<br>
Control  mice  were  similarly  inj ected  with chitosan gel alone. A palpable gel was formed within 10 minutes of injection. Implants were recovered at 21, 48, and  63  days  post-injection.  Toluidine  blue  staining revealed the gross production of GAG-rich extracellular matrix by the implants containing cells (Fig. 8A) . No GAG accumulation was seen in implants of chitosan gel alone (Fig. 8B) .  Primary calf chondrocytes at 2 x 107 cells/ml liquid chitosan gel were injected in liquid form as 100 ul  subcutaneous dorsal implants in anesthetized  nude mice.  Control mice received 100 ?l subcutaneous dorsal implants of liquid chitosan gel alone.   48 days after injection,  implants  were harvested  and processed  for paraffin   histology   and   toluidine   blue   staining. Metachromatic violet staining reveals the accumulation of GAG in the implant with chondrocytes (Fig. 8A) . No GAG accumulation is detected in the implant with chitosan gel only (Fig. 8B) .<br>
Cartilage-specific mRNA expression, collagen type II and aggrecan, was detected in the in vivo implants with primary chondrocytes at day 48 post-injection (Fig. 9).<br>
No type II collagen or aggrecan expression was detected in implants of chitosan gel alone (Fig. 9) . A mixture of antisense 32P-labelled RNA probes complementary to bovine type II collagen, aggrecan, and GAPDH were hybridized with tRNA (lane 1), or total RNA, from bovine kidney (lane 2), from day=48 in vivo nude mouse implants with chitosan gel only (lane 3) or day=48 in vivo implants of chitosan gel with primary chondrocytes at 2 x 107 cells/ml (lane 4) , or adult bovine articular cartilage (lane 5) .   Samples were treated with RNase A<br><br>
- 34 -<br>
and Tl, then submitted to electrophoresis and autoradiography. Protected bands showing the presence of individual transcripts are as indicated. The maintenance in vivo of the chondrocyte phenotype in the chitosan/glycerol-phosphate gel is shown by the expression of aggrecan and type II collagen.<br>
Cartilage-specific proteins were detected in in vivo implants with primary chondrocytes from days 48 and 63  post-injection  (Fig.  10).    No  cartilage-specific proteins were detected in implants with chitosan gel only (Fig. 10) . Total proteins were extracted, separated by SDS-PAGE,  and immunoblotted with antisera  recognizing vimentin, PCNA, the C-propeptide of type II collagen, or cartilage  link  protein.    Samples  analysed  include chitosan gel with no cells (lane 1), bovine kidney (lane 2) , two distinct in vivo nude mouse implants of chitosan gel only at day 63 (lanes 3 and 4), of in vivo implants of chitosan gel with 2 x 107 calf chondrocytes per ml gel at days  48  (lane  5)  or  day  63  (lane  6) ,  2-week  calf cartilage (lane 7), or adult bovine cartilage (lane 8). Results  show  the  accumulation  of  cartilage-specific extracellular matrix proteins CP2 and link, in only those chitosan gel implants carrying chondrocytes.  The acronym PCNA means "proliferating cell nuclear antigen".    CP refers to type 2 collagen C pro-peptide and link refers to cartilage link protein.<br>
The in vivo implants with no cells had a pasty consistency, whereas the implants with cells could be cored into 3 to 5 mm discs and subjected to mechanical testing to reveal a high mechanical stiffness not found in an in vitro disc without cells (Fig. 11) . These data indicate that chondrocytes can be delivered in situ, via injection, with the chitosan thermogelling solution as a carrier. The injected chondrocytes remain viable, and synthesize  and  assemble  significant  levels  of  a<br><br>
- 35 -<br>
proteoglycan-rich extracellular matrix that stiffens over time to form a functional cartilaginous tissue.  In Fig. 11, primary calf chondrocytes at 2 x 107 cells /ml liquid chitosan gel were injected in liquid form as 100 ul subcutaneous dorsal implants in anesthetized nude mice. Control mice received 100 ?l subcutaneous dorsal implants of liquid chitosan gel alone.  48 days after injection, implants were harvested. Implants of chitosan gel only had  a  paste-like  consistency,  and  could  not  be mechanically tested.  Implants with primary chondrocytes had the appearance of cartilage, and a 3 mm biopsy was cored from the center of the implant,  and tested in unconfined compression using 2.5% thickness compression with a relaxation criteria of 0.05g/min. The equilibrium modulus at 20% and 50% compression offset is shown for the 48 day implant containing cells compared to a control disk left in vitro during a 42 day period. The in vivo grown chondrocyte laden gel has developed substantial mechanical stiffness during 48 days due to the synthesis and assembly of a functional cartilage matrix (Fig. 8A).<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
Adhesion of fchermogelling chitosan solution to cartilage<br>
and bone surfaces<br>
One of the most significant advantages of this chitosan thermogelling formulation for cartilage repair is its ability to conform and adhere to irregular cartilage defects and other irregularly shaped cavities in the body that require tissue repair, regeneration, reconstruction or bulking. Many current tissue repair procedures suffer drastically in this respect. Chitosan-glycerol phosphate liquid gel without cells was delivered ex vivo to porcine femoral condylar intra-chondral (not involving bone) defects. Disc-shaped defects in the articular cartilage were created using a biopsy punch<br><br>
- 36 -<br>
(Fig. 12A) and the chitosan solution described in Example 1 was injected into these defects and allowed to solidify in an incubator  at  37 °C.  The articulating cartilage surface was opposed and simulated joint motions were performed after which the gel was observed to remain in the  cartilage  defect  (Fig.  12B) .  The  gel  not  only remained  in  the  defect  but  also  adhered  to  the surrounding bone  and cartilage surfaces  and did  not contract.  In  Figs. 12A and 12B, liquid chitosan gel was deposited  in  6 mm  diameter  full-thickness  cartilage defects (Fig. 12A) and allowed to solidify at 37°C for 30 minutes in a humidified incubator.   The joint was then closed, and joint motion simulated for several minutes. The chitosan gel adhered to and was retained in all of the defects after simulated joint motion (Fig. 12B) .<br>
In vivo filling of intrachondral defects was also performed  on  the  patellar  groove  of  rabbits.  A rectangular (4mm x 5mm) defect was created by shaving off cartilage down to the harder calcified cartilage layer with a microsurgical knife.  Several microfracture holes were  introduced  using  a   16-gauge  needle.      The thermogelling chitosan solution described in Example 1 was injected into this defect and allowed to solidify for 5 minutes (Fig. 13A) and the rabbit knee joint sutured up. The rabbit was allowed to ambulate freely and the following day it was euthanised and the treated knee j oint prepared for histological analysis (Fig. 13B).  A live New Zealand White rabbit was anesthetized, and a 3 x 4 mm chondral-only defect created in the trochlea of the ¦ femoral patellar groove.   Several microfracture holes were  introduced  with  a. 16  gauge  needle.    Liquid thermogelling chitosan was loaded into the defect and allowed to gel for 5 minutes in situ (Fig. 13A) .   The joint was closed, and the rabbit allowed to recover with<br><br>
- 37 -<br>
unrestricted motion for 24 hours before sacrifice and joint dissection (Fig. 13B).<br>
Histological  analysis  (Fig.  14)  revealed  the retention of this thermogelling chitosan gel in the very thin cartilage layer of the rabbit  (only about 0.8mm thick). The gel adhered firmly to surrounding bone and cartilage tissue, demonstrating good retention, thereby enabling its use as an injectable thermogelling polymer delivery vehicle for the repair of cartilage and other tissues.  The joint and defect shown in Fig. 13B (filled with thermogelling chitosan, and residing 24 hours in vivo) was fixed,  embedded in LR White plastic resin, sectioned,  and stained with Toluidine Blue. A cross-section of the defect reveals retention of the chitosan gel in situ, as well as adherence to cartilage and bone surfaces in the defect.<br>
EXftMPLE 4<br>
Preparation, mixing and in vitro solidification of<br>
blood/polymer mixture<br>
Several distinct mixing methods were employed to admix blood with an agueous polymer solution (Fig. 15A) . Blood and polymer are admixed in a recipient, resulting in a homogenous liquid blend of blood and polymer.<br>
In general, 3 volumes blood was mixed with 1 volume of 1.5% polysaccharide in an isotonic and iso-osmolaric solution. In the case of chitosan gel, 1.5% chitosan was dissolved in 70mM HC1 and 135mM ?-glycerol phosphate. In the first blood/polymer mixing method, one, Icc syringe was loaded with 7-50 ?l whole peripheral blood, and a second Icc syringe was loaded with 250 ul liquid polymer solution. The syringes were, interconnected, and mixed by pumping the two phases back-and-forth 40 times, until apparently homogenous. In the second mixing method, 625 ul of liquid polymer solution<br><br>
- 38 -<br>
was deposited in a 2. Oml cryovial (Corning) with several 3mm-6mm steel balls.   The  cryovial was  filled  with 1.875ml whole blood, the cap screwed on, and the vial shaken vigorously for 10 seconds.  In the third mixing method, 2ml of liquid polymer solution was deposited in a sterile  12ml glass  borosilicate vial  (InterGlass  5cc serological vial). The vial closed with a rubber stopper and metal crimper, and a 25ml air vacuum was drawn in. the vial with a 10ml syringe and 20^gauge needle.   Using proper  phlebotomy  techniques,  peripheral  blood  from either rabbit artery, or human or equine vein was drawn into a sterile 10ml syringe.   A 20-gauge needle was attached to the syringe, and inserted through the rubber stopper of the vial. 6ml of peripheral blood was admitted to the vial.  The vial was vortex mixed for 10 seconds at full speed.   Following any of these mixing techniques, the  resulting  mixture  was  deposited  into  a  4  ml borosilicate glass vial at room temperature, a plastic vial at 37°C, or an agarose well (Figs. 15B and 15C) , or an articular cartilage defect ex vivo.  As a control, the same treatment was performed with peripheral whole blood only.   As another control, a vacutainer vial of EDTA-treated blood was drawn to measure CBC and platelet number.   All blood samples tested displayed normal CBC and  platelet  counts  for  the  respective  species. Regardless of the species, the prepared blood/polymer, solidified and adhered strongly to the walls of the glass vial within 2.5 to 18 minutes after mixing (Fig. 16) . Mixed whole peripheral blood solidified in general more slowly  compared  to  blood/chitosan  gel  (Fig.   16) . Separate  samples  of  blood,  with  or  without  liquid chitosan gel,  were mixed and solidification time was measured by the number of minutes elapsed between mixing, and achieving ( a solid adherent mass in the original mixing vial, or secondary recipient.<br><br>
Testing of additional  blood/polymer  solutions, including   blood/hyaluronic   acid,   blood/hydroxyethyl cellulose,  and  blood/alginate,  revealed  that  these mixtures  also  solidify  in  a  time  period  that  is comparable  to blood  alone  (Fig.  17A) .  Here  it  was concluded that admixture of chitosan liquid gel  into whole peripheral blood accelerates clot formation,  and that blood/chitosan gel solidification time is acceptable for clinical application.   Contraction was tested on mixed fresh peripheral rabbit blood,  or rabbit blood mixed with PBS or various 1.5% polysaccharide solutions including chitosan in glycerol phosphate buffer*   Fresh blood without mixing was also analyzed.   A heparin blood/chitosan in glycerol phosphate buffer mixture was also analyzed.  500 ul of each sample was deposited into a 4 ml glass tube at 37°C.  At distinct time points, all excluded plasma was removed from each tube and weighed, to determine the amount of clot contraction.  All samples except   blood/chitosan   glycerol   phosphate   mixtures contracted   to   30-50%   of   their   original   volume. Blood/chitosan mixtures contracted minimally maintaining approximately 90% of their initial volume.<br>
To test for the degree of contraction of solidified blood/polymer mixes relative to coagulated whole blood, a clot contraction test was performed on an array of blood/polymer samples, using several controls (Figs. 17A, 17B and 17C) . One group of controls consisted of non-agitated whole peripheral blood, or agitated whole peripheral blood, or whole peripheral blood agitated 3 : 1 (volume : volume) with phosphate-buffered saline. These samples were compared with experimental samples containing 3 volumes whole peripheral blood agitated with 1 volume of distinct 1.5% polysaccharide solutions dissolved in PBS (alginate, hydroxyethyl cellulose,  or hyaluronic acid).   Another<br><br>
- 40 -<br>
sample consisted of 3 volumes whole peripheral blood mixed with 1 volume chitosan-glycerol phosphate solution. At intervals up to 18 hours after solidification,  the excluded  serum  for  each  condition  was  measured  in triplicate, as an indication of degree of contraction. Samples with peripheral blood, ±PBS, contracted to 30% of the original mass (Fig. 17A). Peripheral blood admixed with   the   polysaccharides   alginate,   hydroxyethyl cellulose, or hyaluronic acid contracted to 40%-50% of the original mass  (Fig. 17A).   The blood/chitosan gel samples showed negligible contraction, with contraction to 90% of the original mass (Fig. 17A).  The heparinised blood/chitosan gel samples also resisted contraction, to 85% of the original mass (Fig. 17A) . From these data it was   concluded   that   blood/chitosan   gel   resists contraction,  and provides a more space-filling fibrin scaffolding inside the cartilage defect.   In Figs. 17B and 17C, samples shown include blood (1), or mixed blood (2) , blood/PBS (3) , blood/chitosan in glycerol-phosphate (4) ,  heparin  blood/chitosan  (5),  blood/alginate  (6), blood/hydroxyethyl cellulose  (7),  and blood/hyaluronic acid (.8) .<br>
To test whether anti-coagulated blood could be used to generate blood/polysaccharide in situ solidifying implants, 3 volumes of blood treated with 1.5 mM EDTA, 0.38% citrate,  acid-0.38% citrate dextrose,  or sodium heparin  (Becton  Dickinson)  was  mixed with  1  volume chitosan-glycerol phosphate solution. Chitosan-glycerol-phosphate solution was able to reverse heparin-  (Fig. 18), EDTA-, and citrate-mediated anti-coagulation. 1.5% chitosan  in  glycerol-phosphate  solution,  or  three distinct 1.5% polysaccharide solutions, were admixed at a ratio of 1 volume polysaccharide solution, to 3 parts whole peripheral blood.   500 ?l of each sample was deposited in a glass borosilicate tube and allowed to<br><br>
- 41 -<br>
solidify -for 60 minutes at 37°C. Different polysaccharides include hyaluronic acid-PBS (1), hydroxyethyl cellulose-PBS (2) , alginate-PBS (3), and chitosan-glycerol phosphate (4) . As a control, heparin blood only was analyzed (5) . After 60 minutes, the tubes were laid horizontally and photodocumented. Only the mixture of chitosan-glycerol phosphate and heparinised blood became solid.<br>
Other heparin blood/polysaccharide mixtures using hydroxyethyl cellulose,  alginate,  or hyaluronic  acid, failed to solidify (Fig. 18) .   From these data it was concluded  that  blood/chitosan  in  situ  solidifying implants can be generated using anti-coagulated blood.<br>
Histological  sections  of  solid  blood/polymer samples showed that mixtures were homogenous, that red blood  cells  did  not  hemolyse  after  mixing  or solidification, and that platelets became activated and were functional  (as evidenced by the generation of a dense fibrin network)  (Figs. 19A to 19C).  A solidified mixture of blood/chitosan was fixed, embedded in LR White plastic, sectioned, and stained with Toluidine Blue.  (In Fig. 19A, at 20x magnification, global homogeneous mixing is  apparent.  .  In  Fig.  19B,  at  lOOx  magnification, intermixed  pools  of  red  blood  cells  and  chitosan hydropolymer is apparent.   At 2000x magnification  (by environmental electron scanning microscopy) the presence of fibrin fiber network throughout the blood/chitosan composite is evident.<br>
Some leukocytes remained viable a number of hours following mixing and solidification (Fig. 20) . Peripheral whole blood was mixed with chitosan gel and allowed to solidify. In Fig. 20A, 60 minutes post-solidification, the plug was placed in viability stain with calcein AM/ethidium homodimer-1 to reveal live white blood cells (green cells, large arrows), live platelets<br><br>
- 42 -<br>
(green cells, small arrows), and dead white blood cells (red nuclei). In Fig. 20B, a distinct sample was fixed at 180 minutes post-solidification,  embedded in LR-White, and  submitted  to  Transmission  Electron  Microscopy. Active phagocytosis by peripheral monocytes (arrow head), reflecting cell viability, is evident in TEM micrographs at 3 hours post-mixing and solidification.<br>
An analysis of the total serum proteins lost from either blood or blood/chitosan following solidification was performed.  Equal volumes of blood, or blood/chitosan gel were solidified in agarose wells.   The discs were transferred  to  individual  wells  of  a  48-well plate containing 1 ml PBS and incubated at 37 °C for 3 hours. The  discs  were  successively  changed into  fresh  PBS solution at 37°C at 4, 5, 7, and 19 hours.   PBS washes were lightly centrifuged to remove any cells prior to analysis.  Several discs were extracted for total protein after 3 or 19 hours in PBS.  Total proteins present in the discs, or PBS washes, were analysed by SDS-PAGE and total protein stain with Sypro Orange.   Serum proteins were  released  more  slowly  more  sustained  from  the blood/chitosan samples compared with blood samples (Fig. 21) .  These data suggest that blood and platelet-derived proteins involved in wound healing are released in a more sustained and prolonged manner from blood/chitosan-filled defects, compared with blood clot-filled defects. Solid discs  of  blood/chitosan  gel,  or  blood  only,  were generated from 150 ?l initial liquid volume.  Resulting discs  were  washed in  1  ml  PBS  for  3  hours,  then transferred successively at 4, 5, 7, and 19 hours for a total of four additional 1 ml PBS washes. After 3 or 19 ' hours of washing,  representative discs were extracted with GuCl to solubilise total retained proteins. Soluble proteins were precipitated from equal volumes of GuCl extracts or PBS washes, separated on SDS-PAGE gels, and<br><br>
- 43 -<br>
stained for total proteins using Sypro Orange. Comparatively, more proteins were retained in the blood/polymer discs than the blood discs throughout the 19 hour wash period- Comparatively, a slower and more prolonged release of serum proteins into the PBS washes was seen for blood/chitosan than blood over the 19 hour wash period.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
Preparation, mixing and injection of blood/polymer mixture to improve healing of articular cartilage defects<br>
Chondral  defects  with  perforations  to  the subchondral  bone  were  treated with  a  peripheral blood/chitosan-glycerol  phosphate  mixture  that   was delivered as a liquid, and allowed to solidify in situ (Figs.  22A to  22C) .    In Fig.  22A,  a full-thickness cartilage defect, 3x4 mm square, was created in the femoral patellar groove of an adult (more than 7 months) New Zealand White rabbit.  Four, 1 mm diameter microdrill holes were pierced to the bone,  until bleeding was observed.  In Fig. 22B, liquid whole blood was mixed at a ratio of 3 volumes blood to 1 volume chitosan in glycerol phosphate solution, and deposited to fill the defect.  In Fig. 22C, after 5 minutes in situ, the blood/chitosan implant appeared to solidify.  The capsule and skin were sutured,  and  the  animal  allowed  to  recover  with unrestricted motion.<br>
A similar treatment in human patients is schematized in Fig. 22D, where prepared cartilage defects receive an arthroscopic injection of liquid blood/polymer that solidifies in situ. Alternatively, an arthroscopic injection of liquid polymer is mixed with bone-derived blood at the defect site (Fig. 22E) . In Fig. 22D, the patient blood is mixed with the polymer ex vivo, and delivered to a prepared defect by arthroscopic injection.<br><br>
- 44 -<br>
or (Fig. 22E) the polymer is delivered arthroscopically or during open knee surgery and mixed at the defect site with patient blood issuing from the defect.<br>
As  a  proof-of-concept  study,  the  effects  of blood/chitosan gel  treatment  were  tested  in  rabbits. Adult,  skeletally mature New Zealand White rabbits  (7 months  and  older)  were  anesthetized,  with  xylazine-ketamine followed by isofluorene/oxygen gas anesthesia. The trochlea of the femoral patellar groove was exposed by a parapatellar incision and patellar displacement.  A full-thickness cartilage defect, up to 4 x 5 mm, in the trochlea of the femoral patellar groove,  was produced with a microsurgical knife.   Four,  4 mm deep,  1 mm diameter bone-penetrating holes were generated by either microdrill with constant irrigation with 4°C PBS, or by puncture with a custom-made awl and hammer.  The defect was flushed with PBS,  and depending on the degree of bleeding, up to 200 ul of sterile epinephrine (2ug/ml) in  phosphate buffered saline was injected into the bleeding holes.  The cartilage defect was covered with a sterile gauze  soaked with PBS.   Rabbit peripheral blood was removed  from the  central  artery  of  the  ear with a vacutainer™ needle and untreated, siliconized glass 4cc vacutainer™ vials from Becton Dickison.<br>
In one treatment, 750 ?l blood was drawn into a sterile Icc syringe. A second syringe holding 250pl of chitosan-glycerol phosphate solution (1.5% chitosan/70 mM HC1/135 mM p-glycerol phosphate) was interconnected with the blood-containing syringe with a sterile plastic connector. The syringes were pumped back-and-forth 40' times. The mix was drawn into one syringe, to which a 20-gauge needle was attached. After purging half of the mix, one drop (about 25ul) was deposited into the defect. In a separate treatment, 2 ml blood was added to a polypropylene  cryovial  tube  containing  667  ul  1.5%<br><br>
- 45 -<br>
chitosan/70 mM HC1/135 mM {3-glycerol phosphate and 6 sterile 3.2mm diameter stainless steel beads.   The tube was capped, and shaken for 10 seconds, rigorously (around 40 to 50 actions).   The resulting liquid blood/chitosan mix was removed from the vial with a sterile Ice syringe, and a 20g needle was attached to the syringe.   After purging 200ul from the syringe, one drop (about 25 ?l) was  deposited  to  fill  the  cartilage  defect.    The blood/chitosan mixture was allowed to solidify for 5 minutes, after which the capsule and skin were sutured, and the wound disinfected.  Rabbits were sacrificed at 1 week (n=l, male) or at 51 or 56 days {n~2,  1 male, 1 female).   Joints were fixed,  decalcified,  embedded in LR/White plastic, sectioned, and stained with Toluidine Blue.    Blood/chitosan-treated  defects  at  1  week  of healing  revealed  large  numbers  of  chemotactic  cells migrating towards the blood/chitosan-filled zone  (Fig. 23A).     Untreated  defects  had  a  relatively  weak chemotactic response {Fig. 23B) towards the blood clot at the top of the defect.  A chondral defect with microdrill holes was created in both femoral patellar grooves of an adult New Zealand White rabbit, one of which was filled with blood/chitosan gel, and another left untreated.  One week after healing, the joints were fixed, processed in LR-White, and Toluidine blue stained.  At 2 to 3 mm below the surface of the cartilage, a large number of cells migrating towards the defect filled with blood/chitosan were evident  (Fig. 23A), whereas fewer migrating cells were seen at the same region of the untreated defect {Fig. 23B).<br>
After 5 to 8 weeks healing, the blood/chitosan-treated defect was filled with hyaline repair tissue in 2 rabbits (1 male, 1 female)(Fig. 24A). This blood/chitosan-based repair tissue had the appearance of hyaline, GAG-rich cartilage repair tissue.   The repair<br><br>
- 46 -<br>
tissue   from   untreated,   or   blood-only   treated microfracture   defects,   had   the   appearance   of fibrocartilage  (Fig.  24B).   There was no histological evidence  pf  blood/chitosan  or  blood clot  persisting within the  defect  site at or beyond 3  weeks  post-delivery.   A chondral defect with microdrill holes was created in both femoral patellar grooves of an adult New Zealand White rabbit,  one of which was  filled  with blood/chitosan gel, and another left untreated.  At 51 or 56 days after healing, the joints -were fixed, processed in LR-White, and Toluidine blue stained.   In Fig. 24A, repair tissue from the blood/chitosan-treated defect had the  appearance  of  metachromatically  staining  hyaline cartilage,  which adhered to the defect surfaces,  and filled the defect.  In Fig. 24B, repair tissue from the untreated defect had the appearance of fibro-cartilage, with practically no metachromatic staining for GAG, and only partial defect filling.<br>
While  the  invention  has  been  described  with particular reference to the illustrated embodiments, it will be understood that numerous modifications thereto will appear to those skilled in the art. Accordingly, the above description and accompanying drawings ¦ should be taken as illustrative of the invention and not in a limiting sense. For example, we have demonstrated that mixing  chitosan  in  solution  with  blood  allows  the formation of polymer/blood clot that does not contract significantly,   demonstrates   a   slowed   release   of chemotactic and mitogenic blood proteins, maintenance of blood cell viability, and a dramatically improved repair of articular cartilage defects. It is obvious to those skilled in the art that the chitosan solution could be prepared differently to achieve the same result. Examples include:  1)  altered chitosan concentration and mixing ratio with blood 2) altered choice of aqueous solution by<br><br>
- 47 -<br>
changing buffer type and species concentration 3)  an aqueous  suspension  of   chitosan  aggregates   4)   a particulate chitosan powder combined with a proper mixing technique to distribute these particle throughout the blood and partly dissolve them Other polymers may be used such as 1) another polysaccharide like hyaluronan if its anti-coagulant effect is overcome by formulating it in a procoagulating state  (such as by using a  low concentration or combining it with thrombin)  and 2)  a protein polymer such as polylysine or collagen could be used to achieve similar effects.  Although it  is not believed  that  these  latter  approaches  will  be  as successful   as  our  preferred  embodiment,   due  to immunogenicity, toxicity,  and cell adhesion/contraction effects, these and other formulations are considered part of  the  present  invention  since  they  possess  the characteristics of the polymer preparation of the present invention being that 1)  it is mixable with blood or selected  components  of  blood,  2)  that  the  resulting mixture is injectable or can be placed at or in a body site   that   requires   tissue  repair,   regeneration, reconstruction or bulking and 3) that the mixture has a beneficial   effect   on   the   repair,   regeneration, reconstruction or bulking of  tissue  at  the  site  of placement.<br>
