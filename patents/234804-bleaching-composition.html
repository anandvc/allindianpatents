FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to the enhancement of bleaching compositions that are substantially devoid of peroxyl species.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
The use of bleaching catalysts for stain removal has been developed over recent years.  The recent discovery that some catalysts are capable of bleaching effectively in the absence of an added peroxyl source has recently become the focus of some interest, for example: WO9965905; WO0012667; WO0012808; WO0029537, and, WO0060045.<br>
The shelf life of a product may be regarded as the period of time over which the product may be stored whilst retaining its required quality.  A satisfactory shelf life is in many instances a crucial factor for the success of a commercial product.  A 'product with a short shelf life generally dictates that the product is made in small batches and is rapidly sold to the consumer.  It is also a concern to the owners of a brand, with a short shelf life that the consumer uses the product within the shelf life otherwise the consumer may be inclined to change to a similar product of another brand.   In contrast a similar product with a long shelf life may be made in larger batches, held as stock for a longer period of time and the period of time that a consumer stores the<br><br>

THE BLEACH CATALYST<br>
Recently we have found that oily stains are bleached in the presence of selected transition metal catalysts in the absence of an added peroxyl source.  The bleaching of an oily stain in the absence of an added peroxyl source has been attributed to oxygen derived from the air. Whilst it is true that bleaching is effected by oxygen sourced from the air the route in which oxygen plays a<br><br>
WO 2004/111171<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/004799<br><br>
-   9   -<br>
part is becoming understood.  In this regard, the term "air bleaching" is used.<br>
We have concluded from our research that bleaching of a chromophore in an oily stain is effected by products formed by adventitious oxidation of components in the oily stain.  These products, alkyl hydroperoxides, are generated naturally by autoxidation of the oily stain and the alkyl hydroperoxides together with a transition metal catalyst serve to bleach chromophores in the oily stain. Alkyl hydroperoxides (ROOH) are generally less reactive that other peroxy species, for example, peracids (RC(O)OOH), hydrogen peroxide (H202), percarbonates and perborates.  In this regard, the phrase "for bleaching a substrate with atmospheric oxygen" is synonymous with "for bleaching a substrate via atmospheric oxygen" because it is the oxygen in the air that provides the bleaching species used by catalyst to bleach the substrate stain.<br>
The bleach catalyst per se may be selected from a wide range of transition metal complexes of organic molecules (ligands). In typical washing compositions the level of the organic substance is such that the in-use level is from 0.05 uM to 50 mM, with preferred in-use levels for domestic laundry operations falling in the range 1 to 100 uM.  Higher levels may be desired and applied in industrial textile bleaching processes. Suitable organic molecules (ligands) for forming complexes and complexes thereof are found, for example in:<br><br>

An example of a preferred catalyst is a transition metal complex of MeN4Py ligand (N,N-bis(pyridin- 2-yl-methyl)-1,1-bis(pyridin-2-yl)-1-aminoethane).<br>

BALANCE CARRIERS AND ADJUNCT INGREDIENTS<br>
These are generally surfactants, builders, foam agents, anti-foam agents, solvents, and enzymes.  The use and amounts of these components are such that the bleaching composition performs depending upon economics, environmental factors and use of the bleaching composition.<br>
The air bleach catalyst may be used in a detergent composition specifically suited for stain bleaching purposes, and this constitutes a second aspect of the invention. To that extent, the composition comprises a surfactant and optionally other conventional detergent ingredients. The invention in its second aspect provides an enzymatic detergent composition which comprises from 0.1 - 50 % by weight, based on the total detergent composition, of one or more surfactants. This surfactant<br><br>
WO 2004/111171<br><br>
PC77EP2004/00479!)<br><br>
-   13   -<br>
system may in turn comprise 0 - 95 % by weight of one or more anionic surfactants and 5 to 100 % by weight of one or more nonionic surfactants. The surfactant system may additionally contain amphoteric or zwitterionic detergent compounds, but this in not normally desired owing to their relatively high cost. The enzymatic detergent composition according to the invention will generally be used as a dilution in water of about 0.05 to 2%.<br>
In general, the nonionic and anionic surfactants of the surfactant system may be chosen from the surfactants described "Surface Active Agents" Vol. 1, by Schwartz &amp; Perry, Interscience 1949, Vol. 2 by Schwartz, Perry &amp; Berch, Interscience 1958, in the current edition of "McCutcheon1s Emulsifiers and Detergents" published by Manufacturing Confectioners Company or in "Tenside-Taschenbuch", H. Stache, 2nd Edn., Carl Hauser Verlag, 1981.<br>
Suitable nonionic detergent compounds which may be used include, in particular, the reaction products of compounds having a hydrophobic group and a reactive hydrogen atom, for example, aliphatic alcohols, acids, amides or alkyl phenols with alkylene oxides, especially ethylene oxide either alone or with propylene oxide. Specific nonionic detergent compounds are C6-C22 alkyl phenol-ethylene oxide condensates, generally 5 to 25 EO, i.e. 5 to 25 units of ethylene oxide per molecule, and the condensation products of aliphatic Ca-CiB primary or secondary linear or branched alcohols with ethylene oxide, generally 5 to 40 EO.<br><br>
WO 2004/111171<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/004790<br><br>
-   14   -<br>
Suitable anionic detergent compounds which may be used are usually water-soluble alkali metal salts of organic sulphates and sulphonates having alkyl radicals containing from about 8 to about 22 carbon atoms, the term alkyl being used to include the alkyl portion of higher acyl radicals. Examples of suitable synthetic anionic detergent compounds are sodium and potassium alkyl sulphates, especially those obtained by sulphating higher Ce-Cis alcohols, produced for example from tallow or coconut oil, sodium and potassium alkyl C9-C20 benzene sulphonates, particularly sodium linear secondary alkyl C10-C15 benzene sulphonates; and sodium alkyl glyceryl ether sulphates, especially those ethers of the higher alcohols derived from tallow or coconut oil and synthetic alcohols derived from petroleum. The preferred anionic detergent compounds are sodium C11-C15 alkyl benzene sulphonates and sodium C12-C18 alkyl sulphates. Also applicable are surfactants such as those described in EP-A-328 177 (Unilever), which show resistance to salting-out, the alkyl polyglycoside surfactants described in EP-A-070 074, and alkyl monoglycosides.<br>
Preferred surfactant systems are mixtures of anionic with nonionic detergent active materials, in particular the groups and examples of anionic and nonionic surfactants pointed out in EP-A-34 6 995 (Unilever). Especially preferred is surfactant system that is a mixture of an alkali metal salt of a Ci6-Ci8 primary alcohol sulphate together with a C12-C15 primary alcohol 3-7 EO ethoxylate.<br><br>
WO 2004/111171<br><br>

-   15   -<br>
The nonionic detergent is preferably present in amounts greater than 10%, e.g. 25-90% by weight of the surfactant system. Anionic surfactants can be present for example in amounts in the range from about 5% to about 40% by weight of the surfactant system.<br>
One skilled in the art will appreciate that some adventitious peroxyl species may be in the composition nevertheless it is most preferred that the bleaching composition of the present invention has less that 1%, preferably less than 0.1%, most preferably less than 0.01%, of a peroxyl species present.  These adventitious peroxyl are predominantly alkyl hydroperoxides formed by autoxidation of the surfactants.<br>
The detergent composition may take any suitable physical form, such as a powder, granular composition, tumble dryer sheet, tablets, a paste or an anhydrous gel.<br>
The composition may contain additional enzymes as found in WO 01/00768 Al page 15, line 25 to page 19, line 29, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference.<br>
Builders, polymers and other enzymes as optional ingredients may also be present as found in WO0060045.<br>
Suitable detergency builders as optional ingredients may also be present as found in WO0034427.<br><br>

The composition of the present invention may be used for laundry cleaning, hard surface cleaning (including cleaning of lavatories, kitchen work surfaces, floors, mechanical ware washing etc.). As is generally known in the art, bleaching compositions are also employed in waste-water treatment, pulp bleaching during the manufacture of paper, leather manufacture, dye transfer inhibition, food processing, starch bleaching, sterilisation, whitening in oral hygiene preparations and/or contact lens disinfection.<br>
In the context of the present invention, bleaching should be understood as relating generally to the decolourisation of stains or of other materials attached to or associated with a substrate.  However, it is envisaged that the present invention can be applied where a requirement is the removal and/or neutralisation by an oxidative bleaching reaction of malodours or other undesirable components attached to or otherwise associated with a substrate.  Furthermore, in the context of the present invention bleaching is to be understood as being restricted to any bleaching mechanism or process that does not require the presence of light or activation by light.<br>
LIQUID FORMULATION<br>
The present invention has particular utility for liquid formulations because in contrast to a solid heterogeneous mixture in a liquid formulation the contact between individual components are more intimate and hence more<br><br>
WO 2(104/111171<br><br>
PCT/EP2O04/O04799<br><br>
-   17   -<br>
susceptible to degradation due to interaction of components.<br>
There are many commercial liquid formulations for detergents and rinse conditioners or other liquid products that may be enhanced by conferring a bleaching ability to the liquid formulation.  As will be evident to one skilled in the art the present invention is applicable to known liquid formulations and liquid formulations to be developed.<br>
The level of the catalyst in a commercial bleaching composition is from 0.0001 to 0.6 wt/wt %, preferably 0.001 to 0.15 wt/wt %, most preferably 0.01 to 0.1 wt/wt %.  We have found that the level of catalyst is optimum between 0.03 to 0.09 wt/wt % in the commercial bleaching composition.<br>
The present invention extends to both isotropic and complex liquid compositions and formulations a brief discussion of which follows.  Some isotropic formulations are termed 'micro-emulsion' liquids that are clear and thermodynamically stable over a specified temperature range. The 'micro-emulsion' formulation may be water in oil, or oil in water emulsions. Some liquid formulations are macro-emulsions that are not clear and isotropic. Emulsions are considered meta-stable. Concentrated, clear compositions containing fabric softening actives have been disclosed in WO 98/08924 and WO 98/4799, both Procter &amp; Gamble.  Such compositions comprise biodegradable fabric conditioners.  However, both disclose<br><br>

compositions comprising water miscible solvents that do not form water-in-oil micro-emulsions.  Clear fabric conditioning compositions have also been disclosed in EP 730023 (Colgate Palmolive), WO 96/19552 (Colgate Palmolive), WO 96/33800 (Witco Co.), WO 97/03170 (Procter &amp; Gamble), WO 97/03172 (Procter &amp; Gamble), WO 97/03169 (Procter &amp; Gamble), US 5492636 (Quest Int.) and US 5427697 (Procter &amp; Gamble). Liquid formulations of the present invention may contain for example; monoethoxy quats; AQAs and bis-AQAs; cationic amides; cationic esters; amino/diamino quats; glucamide; amine oxides; ethoxylated polyethyleneimines; enhancement polymers of the form linear amine based polymers, e.g. bis-hexamethylenetriamine; polyamines e.g. TETA, TEPA or PEI polymers.<br>
The liquid may be cotained within a sachet as found in WO02/068577.<br>
The following is an example of a liquid bleaching composition to which an organic substance which forms a complex with a transition metal for bleaching a substrate with atmospheric oxygen may be added together further antioxidant if required.  The perfume composition as found in the following example comprising at least 0.01 wt % of an ketonic perfume.<br><br>
