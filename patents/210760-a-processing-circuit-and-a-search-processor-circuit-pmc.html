				<td>A processing circuit and a search processor circuit<br>
The present invention concerns a processing circuit for recognition and comparison of complex patterns in high-speed data streams, particularly for use in search engines for search and retrieval of data stored in structured or unstructured databases, and wherein the processing circuit forms a node in a network of such processing circuits; and a search processor circuit comprising a multiprocessor unit P,, with tree structure for recognition and comparison of complex patterns in high speed data streams, particularly for use in search engines for search and retrieval of data stored in structured or unstructured databases, wherein the multiprocessor unit Pn comprises processing circuits Pi according to claim 1, and wherein the multiprocessor unit ?â€ž forms a circuit realized as a binary or superbinary tree with n+1 levels SQ, Si,...Sn and degree k = 2"", wherein m is a positive integer larger or equal to 1, and a superbinary tree defined by k &gt; 2.<br>
The present invention realizes a search processor circuit on the basis of a multiprocessor unit with a plurality of processing circuits. In a search operation a stream of data is carried in steps through the processing circuits of the search processor circuit and for each step the data which currently are in the chip, are compared with some pattern or other which may be coded as a bit string and beforehand input to the processing circuits.<br>
For searching information <br> large data streams, something which for instance will be topical for search engines for data communication networks of a type such as Internet or Intranet, for monitoring the content of data streams and for retrieval of data in large structured and unstructured databases, there have in recent years been developed dedicated processors. The reason is that recognition and retrieval of information in the above-mentioned fields are critical operations which do not lend themselves to an effective realization with the use of common data processors. Basically search and retrieval of patterns in large data volumes are suited to massively parallel solutions, using a large number of processing elements which simultaneously search in the same or different data segments. By use of a massive parallelism it will be possible to handle a large number of queries or searches simultaneously. For the search it has been proposed to use special<br><br>
search languages which has sufficient power of expression to describe features of the information searched.<br>
In the art there are known processors which use a comparison of strings of data or symbols. As an example of prior art in that connection there may be referred to international published specification WO 94/09443 with the title "Non-numeric coprocessor". Further has the company Paracel Inc. developed a data processing unit called Fast Data Finder (FDF) which is particularly adapted for analysing similarities between data. FDF uses a pattern matching technology which can detect an exact match, but may also be able to find distant similarities, something which may be useful in gene research and text searching.<br>
Further there are from US patent No. 5 553 272 (Ranganathan &amp; al.) known a linear systolic array processor for computing the edit distance between two strings over a given alphabet. This computation is based on a coding scheme which reduces the number of bits which are necessary to represent a state in the computation. The systolic array processor has been given an architecture which does not constrain the length of the strings which can be compared and uses simple basic cells which only need to communicate with the nearest cell neighbour, such that it is very well suited for VLSI implementation.<br>
A disadvantage with the known dedicated search processors is that they do not offer a sufficiently advanced functionality to handle very complex search queries. Another disadvantage is that they to a greater extent are based on a circuit architecture which only with difficulty can offer a functionality of this kind without being unnecessary complicated.<br>
An attempt to solve this problem is known from US patent No. 4860201 (Stolfo &amp; al.) which discloses a parallel processing device structured as a binary tree, where a large number of processors, each with its own I/O unit, are used. Generally Stolfo &amp; al. discloses a computer with a large number of processors connected in a binary tree structure such that each processor apart from those which form respectively the root and the leaves of the tree, has a single parent processor and two child processors. The processors work typically synchronously with data which are transmitted to them from a parent processor and communicate the results further to the nearest following processors. At the same time the child processors of a parent processor can<br><br>
also communicate with each other. According to Stolfo &amp; al. each node forms a processing element which comprises a processor in a real sense, a read/write memory or a random access memory and an I/O means. The I/O means provides interfaces between each processing element and its parent and child processing elements such that a substantial improvement is obtained in the speed whereby data are transmitted through the binary tree structure. As the binary tree structure has a processing element in every node, the processing device generally will comprise 2""-l processing elements, i.e. 1023 processing elements if the binary tree is realized with n = 10 levels. In a preferred embodiment this prior art parallel processing device has a clock frequency of 12 MHz which in case a tree with 1023 processors is used, each processor having an average instruction cycle time of 1,8 j^s, offers a processing performance of about 570 million instructions per second.<br>
A binary parallel processor of this kind can be well suited for handling partitionable data processing problems, for instance searching in large information volumes. A partitionable search problem can be defined as a problem where a query about relation between an object x and and object set corresponds to a repeated use of a commutative and associative a binary operator b which has an identity, and a primitive search query q which is applied between a new object x and each element f in the set F. One has then a partitionable search problem when the logic function OR is combined with the primitive query "is x equal to f" applied between the object x an each element f in F. As stated in Stolfo &amp; al., a problem which consists of answering a query about a set F, can be answered by combining the queries applied to arbitrary subsets of F. The problem is in other words partitionable and well-suited for rapid execution by parallel processing. The set F is partitioned in a number of arbitrary subsets equal to the number of available processors. The primitive query q is then applied in parallel on each processor between the unknown x which is communicated to all processors and the locally stored element f in the set F. The result is then arbitrarily combined in parallel by log2N repetitions of the operators b, a number of computations on N/2 adjoining pairs of processors first being performed and then a corresponding number of computations on N/4 pairs of processors with the results from the first computations. The operations are thus moving during the processing to overlying levels in the binary tree, in other words<br><br>
from child processors to the parent processor etc. and are repeated in parallel on each level.<br>
From Indian patent application IN/PCT/2001/00562CHE which belongs to the present applicant, there is known a digital processing device which is suited for processing digital data signal structures, where the data signal structures comprise repetitive sequences and/or nested patterns. This processing device is generally configured as a regular tree with n+1 levels So, Si,.--Sn and of degree k. This architecture provides a number of advantages compared with that which is disclosed in the above-mentioned US patent No, 4860201 and may in one embodiment be used for realizing a multiprocessor architecture based on a regular binary tree of degree 2 or a superbinary tree for degree 2"", where m is a positive integer greater than 2, such that a superbinary tree for instance will have the degree 4, 8, 16...etc. A binary or superbinary architecture of this kind will similarly to the that proposed in US patent 4860201 be able to handle partitionable search problems in an effective manner.<br>
The main object of the present invention is thus to provide a search processor circuit which with basis in the general multiprocessor architecture as disclosed in the applicant"s above-mentioned international patent application can be realized with a multiprocessor architecture which avoids the above-mentioned disadvantages with dedicated search processors, but which simultaneously also will be able lo provide a far better processing and device economy than that which is the case with the parallel processor as disclosed in US patent No. 4860201.<br>
Further it is an object of the invention to provide a processing circuit which can be used for realizing a multiprocessor unit in a search processor circuit and effectively perform search by comparison of patterns.<br>
Finally it is also an object of the invention to provide a search processor circuit whose architecture not only allows it to handle binary partitionable search problems with appropriate functionality, but also lends itself to implementation with varying degree of integration by means of available circuit solutions known in the field of microelectromcs. Particularly it is in that connection the object that it can be realized in the form of a<br><br>

This is, however, not of essential importance on this level and can easily be changed.<br><br>
A search processor circuit according to the invention is built with a large number of kernel processors in the form of comparator units. Basic comparator units is shown in fig. 2. The register X here only contains the byte X which currently is shifted to the comparator and the register A contains the byte a which x shall be compared to. As evident from fig. 2 four comparisons can take place simullaneousiy, viz. x = a, x &gt;a, x ?^a, x 
How a matching of a repetitive pattern takes place, can be described by the example below with reference to figs. 4a-e.<br>
Fig. 4a - an "a" is shifted into the first comparator unit. None of the comparators show a match.<br>
Fig. 4b - a "b" is shifted in and still there is no match.<br>
Fig. 4c - another "b" is shifted in and the two last units have a match, while the first unit does not. As the two last units had a match, this now requires that the units shall remember that this match must be maintained as long as the middle umt has a match, even though the last unit does not have one.<br><br>
Fig. 4d - several "b"s are shifted in and the match is maintained as described for fig. 4c. If another character besides "b" was shifted into the middle unit, the matches would both have been cleared.<br>
Fig, 4e - a "c" is shifted into the first unit and all three units are now set to indicated a match. A pattern of the form "ab+c" has now been found.<br>
If this method shall be used to repeat patterns consisting of more than a single character, the memory must be connected with a group of comparator units matching the pattern. This shall be described below.<br>
In order that a method as described above shall allow the matching of repeated occurrences of patterns which are longer than a single byte, for instance of the length n it is necessary to keep track whether a match is found of each of the n possible starting points. This can be achieved by connecting n flip-flops and letting the memory bits be shifted thereto as new bytes are shifted into the units. The output from the last flip-flop will then indicate whether or not a match occurred n positions earlier. An example where patterns of two characters are matched is shown in fig, 5. Here Â£[;]" is the actual result from the comparisons, E[i--1] is the result from the next comparator unit used for implementing a sequence control, while E\"i\ is the new result where repeated matching is allowed if the signal m,- is set. The signal sc indicates whether the sequence control should have been used at all. If sc is not set, the matching of multiple patterns will not take place. If it should be possible to vary the length of the patterns which shall be repeated, a scheme like the one shown in fig. 6 can be used. Here a multiplexer is used for selecting the output after the /"th flip-flop, where i is the length of the pattern to match. The use of this method will, however, not be necessary, such this will be described below.<br>
A unit which implements the sequence control necessary to achieve matching of repetitive occurrences of patterns is shown in fig. 7. This unit can be supposed to be placed together with a set of comparator units and the necessary number of D flip-flops. The multiplexer is used to decide whether multiple occurrences of patterns are allowed. The inputs and the outputs can be described as follows:<br><br>
res[i] ":	The res[i] " signal is a result from the comparison with the<br>
repeatable pattern.<br>
The sc signal specifies whether the sequence control shall be used as described in a preceding section. If ^c is set, the unit will only give a positive result if also the next unit also has a positive result. If it is not set, the result from this unit will be independent from the others and repetitive matching will not be allowed.<br>
res[i-\]:       The signal res[i-\] takes the result from the next unit and is used to implement sequence control.<br>
ffoiulQâ– "	The signa] ffa,â€ž[i] takes the output from the last flip-flop through<br>
which the memory bits pass.<br>
ff,,,:	The signal_^â€ž is to be given as the input to the first fiip-flop<br>
through which the memory bits pass.<br>
resfij:	resfij gives the new result from this unit. If the sequence<br>
control is not used and sc is not set, then this will be equal to resfi] ", otherwise, it will be set \ires[i-\] is true, and res[i] " is true, or if repetitive patterns are allowed, ifffoui/ij  is set.<br>
ffot,r[i+^j-     "^^^Jfouifi+"^J input gives the output from the flip-flops of the<br>
preceding element. This makes it possible to connect comparator units for matching repetitive patterns with varying lengths.<br>
In fig. 8 the sequence control unit is shown together with the comparator unit in fig. 2 and allows repetition of the character matched by the comparator unit. Here a single D flip-flop is used to represent the memory and this D flip-flop is hence set if the following conditions are true:<br>
â€¢	Repetitive occurrences of patterns matched by these units shall be allowed.<br>
â€¢	There is a simultaneous match for this unit and the following.<br>
â€¢	All bytes shifted into this unit after the previous conditions becoming true, have been matches.<br>
sc.<br><br>
For this to work, ihe output from the unit which allows multiple occurrences of the matching pattern, must be used to indicate the results for both this unit and the preceding one. In order to generalize the function, sequence control is always used together with multiple pattern matching, as was described above. The unit will in other words only give a positive result if the preceding one also does.<br>
In addition to the matching or repetitive patterns as described in the preceding sections, it can also be of interest to match strings where parts of the pattern is optional. This would take place in an analog manner and can be described by the following example with reference to figs. 9a-c.<br>
Fig. 9a	- An "a" is shifted into the first unit. None of the units have a<br>
match.<br>
Fig. 9b	- A "c" is shifted in and there is now a match on the first unit.<br>
The middle unit shall now remember this.<br>
Fig. 9c	- The characters are shifted to the right and there is now a match<br>
on the last unit. Since there also was same match on the middle unit one character ago, the units have now matched the string ac .<br>
In order for this to take place the sequence control must function in opposite direction than which was the case when repeated patterns were matched.<br>
There shall now be described a tree structure for distributing data to the comparator units. As a data distribution tree a complete balanced binary tree as shown in fig. 10 is used. On each internal node in the tree 3 a multiplexer decides whether two subtrees shall receive the same data elements in parallel or whether they shall receive the elements sequentially. A simple implementation of the binary data distribution tree in fig. 10 is shown in fig. 11.<br>
It is now possible to take another look at the matching of occurring repetitive and skipped patterns, as described above. The processing circuit shown in fig, 8 is used for generating the tree structure in fig. 11, and repeated and skipped patterns shall now be matched on several levels. In order to simplify<br><br>
this, it will be assumed that this only will be allowed for individual characters or for the whole tree which consists of eight processing circuits.<br>
There are now basically six different modes of operation for this tree:<br>
â€¢	No sequence control is employed - the results of each from eight processing circuits are independent.<br>
â€¢	Plain sequence control is used - only the result from the processing circuit 0 will be used and this will be positive only if all eight comparator units have matches.<br>
â€¢	Repetitive matches are allowed for one or several of the comparator units,<br>
â€¢	Skipped matches are allowed for one or several of the comparator units.<br>
â€¢	Repetitive matches are allowed for the whole tree.<br>
â€¢	Skipped matches are allowed for the whole tree.<br>
The first of the above-mentioned points are handled by the processing circuit as shown in fig. 8, the fourth by an analog element for skipping patterns. The last two, however, requires that another sequence control unit, as shown in fig. 7, is used for the whole tree. As can be seen in this figure, the correct number of flip-flops must be available for this unit. The numher of flip-flops which shall be used must be equal to the number of characters in the pattern which shall be repeated, but this may vary from one to eight depending on the configuration of the multiplexers which defines the tree. A solution similar to the one in fig. 6 is evident, but this will make the programming of the circuit more complicated and more error prone, as the number of characters which is to be repeated essentially is set twice, once in the definition of the tree and once in the multiplexer which selects the result from the correct flip-flop. Fortunately a more elegant solution can be obtained by using the flip-flops which already are present in the processing circuits in the tree. As the number of characters in the tree at any given time is given by the data flow, the multiplexers that are used for data distribution, can also be used for routing the memory bits through the correct number of flip-flops. An implementation of this is shown in fig. 12, and as the same flip-flops are used for repetitions on two possible levels, the pattern can be<br><br>
repeated on one of the levels at a time. It should be remarked that repetitive patterns on several levels simultaneously will not be possible by using this method in any case, as the length of the repeatable string will vary. Another complication is that each processing circuit requires results from the preceding comparator unit in order to implement the sequence control, but this will be described below.<br>
It is now possible to extend the tree structure. As shown in fig. 13 a total number of 32 kernel processors or comparator units is used and allows repetitions on a single processing circuit, on a group of eight processing circuits, or on the whole tree. - The same reasoning also applies to the skipping of patterns.<br>
Basically it is two practical ways of collecting the results from a data gathering tree and as described in the preceding section. The most natural is to use another binary tree where the results are combined at each internal node. This, however, has a number of disadvantages, as it makes it impossible to perform certain operations such as requiring that a definite number of processing circuits shall have matches. If the number of processing circuits is relatively small, it will be possible to use a look-up-table LUT. This will, however, be problematic when repeated matches are allowed, as matching is not defined for a part of the tree. These two methods shall be described in the sections below, followed by a discussion of their advantages and disadvantages. First shall be described how results are gathered with the use of a binary tree.<br>
Given the results from two processing circuits it is a natural way of combining them to perform one of the logic operations AND and OR. It may also be advantageous to be able to select only one of the results and ignore the other. A unit which performs this operation is shown in fig. 14 and shali in the following be denoted as a selector. Such units can now be combined in a binary tree and provide a single result from a group of processing circuits, as shown in fig, 15, It will also be possible to use a binary tree for comparing strings alphabetically or numerically, something which will be described in the following. The problem which is mentioned above, namely obtaining the result of the comparison of the character before and after the one being processed by the current processing circuit, can now be dealt with. Firstly,<br><br>
only the preceding or the following results will be necessary at any given time, as the matching of both repeated and skipped patterns cannot be performed simultaneously. This implies, due to the sequence control used, that the result-gathering tree can be configured such that it either selects the right or (eft results for arbitrary processing circuits which looks at different characters. The result for any subtree of Â« units can be found Â« levels up in the result gathering tree. If several units look at the same character, will secondly their preceding and following results also be the same. These results can be found by using the same multiplexers for controlling the data flow, such that a result only is passed on to any neighbouring units which look at the same character.<br>
Fig. 16 shows how the embodiment can be completed with the use of this method. It is important to note that the same set of multiplexers are now used for three different purposes, viz. distributing the data, routing the memory bits through the right number of flip-flops and for providing the results from comparisons of the preceding and following characters.<br>
A simple way of combining a result from the different processing circuits is the use of a look-up table (LUT). It is then possible to specify any requirements to the different processing circuits, including counting the number of matches, and as long a reasonable small tree is used, the size of the look-up table LUT shall not be too large. With eight comparator units it is necessary to set 2   = 256 bits and this will be manageable. A possible implementation of the data distribution tree with LUT is given in fig. 17. The main disadvantage by using this method is that repetitive occurrences of patterns cannot be matched unless this takes place on the level of a single processing circuit or for the whole tree. This is due to the fact that with a LUT there will not be defined any combined results for a character which is examined by 2n units, but this is necessary in order that the sequence control shall work.<br>
In certain situations it can be desirable to maintain hits for a longer time period, i.e. when a match has been found, the positive result will be maintained for a certain number of characters after the actual match. This can be used to perform searches where matches for several patterns shall be found within certain distances of each other. A simple implementation of this<br><br>
is shown in fig. 18. Here some numerical value n is stored in a register and when a match is found, this value is shifted into the counter. The final result is thus maintained at a positive value until the counter reaches 0 and any match will thus have a latency of Â« characters. This latency is called the hit latency.<br>
Based on the above, it is evident that the use of trees and LUTs in order to gather results both have advantages and disadvantages. The tree method makes matching of repetitive patterns easy, but allows only specific logic functions while the LUT method allows all possible functions, but makes matching of repetitive patterns more cumbersome.<br>
The obvious solution is hence to use both methods as this gives the user the possibility to choose the best method in each case, but this leads to additional overhead. Another possibility is to use different methods in different parts of the tree. For instance the tree method can be used of low levels, where repeated patterns are most desirable, and a LUT on higher levels, where counting the number of hits for different patterns can be desirable, or alternatively both methods at low levels and only LUTs at high levels.<br>
Textual data are often divided into a set of non-overlapping documents and when searches are performed on such documents, it is usually undesirable to retrieve matches that span several documents. Jt is hence necessary with some method or other to avoid this. Ignoring the data distribution tree, fig. 19 illustrates the basic operation of a search processor circuit for matching of patterns ("Pattern Matching Chip" (PMC)). Each processing circuit is here supposed to work with only a single character in the text. The document separation can now be handled with use of the setup shown in fig. 20. Here a special pattern-matching unit placed at the beginning of the data path searches for a tag which indicates the beginning of a new document and a signal which indicates this, is passed along together with the data to each processing circuit. Given this signal, the processing circuits can reset all latencies which may be set. This signal is also passed further onto the result selectors and the look-up tables LUTs which gather the results, such that positive result are accepted only when they occur within the same document.<br>
Given the pattern matching capabilities which are described in the above, there are still two problems that must be solved.<br><br>
â€¢	The number of hits shall be sufficiently limited for the receiving system to handle.<br>
â€¢	It must be possible to handle different queries simultaneously in different part of the data distribution tree.<br>
These two issues are related and will be discussed in the following.<br>
Limiting the number of hits shall first be described. As facilities for returning hits from the pattern matching chip to a host processor probably shall have a limited capacity and the hits often arise in groups, it is necessary with some method or other to limit the number of hits. There are two obvious solutions to this problem:<br>
â€¢	Report only one hit for some number of adjacent characters.<br>
â€¢	Report only one hit for each document.<br>
The natural choice is to use both these methods. Fig. 21 shows how this can be done. The flip-flop D keeps track of whether hits are reported within the current hit range, and the first input on the multiplexer MUX is chosen if all hits shall be reported. In addition, a counter could be used to count the number of hits, such that this number is returned instead if the actual hits.If only one hit per document is reported, then this count will be the number of documents with hits.<br>
Now shall the management of multiple queries be discussed. It can be a great advantage if the pattern matching chip (the search processor circuit) is able to handle several simultaneous queries. As the number of processing circuits which is necessary for single queries likely will vary greatly, it should be possible to configure this individually. One practical way of doing this is to let a part of the data distribution tree set up an individual query. The problem with this is that a very large number of results, 2Â«-l for n processing circuits, must be returned to the receiving system, i.e. for 512 processing circuits the numheT of possible results will be 2-512-1=1023, something which usually is regarded as too large. The most natural way of limiting this number is to set a lower limit for the number of processing circuits, which shall be used for a single query. A reasonable choice is here 16 and with 512 circuits this gives 2~-l = 63 possible results, which is an acceptable number. Fig. 22 shows<br><br>
schematically these possible results, as the boxes on the lower level of the tree consist of 16 processing circuits (or comparator units). When this is combined with the method described in the preceding section, a hit limitation unit could be included for each possible result. As it, however, never will be more than -^ simultaneous queries, this number of circuits will be sufficient. For this to work, it is necessary with several hit limitation units to take the results from the number of possible queries, as these queries must be chosen such that none can be active simultaneously. Fig. 23 shows how this can be done, as the possible query points in black here have their own hit limitation unit while only the white query points distribute their results as shown by the arrows. In addition it is necessary to set a bit for each of the possible queries in order to indicate whether the result in question actually represents an independent query.<br>
Now a detailed description of a processing circuit according to the invention shall be given. The processing circuit can be regarded as a module of the search processors and hence be described as search module. The detailed description will refer to Verilog codes for the separate units, as these codes as mentioned are given in tables of an appendix appended to the description.<br>
The processing circuit or the search processor circuit includes a clock and the Verilog code for this clock is shown in table Al of the appendix and the clock signal CLK is in any case given to respectively the comparator unit and the D flip-flops in the processing circuit or to all comparator units and D flip-flop in the search processor circuit. This is trivial and the provision of the clock and the clock signal lines is hence not shown.<br>
The kernel processor or the comparator unit is shown in fig.24. It , of course, corresponds to the kernel processor or comparator unit in fig. 2. The register 6 contains as before the byte x which presently is shifted into the unit and the register 7 contains the byte a which x shall be compared with. As it can be seen from fig.24, four comparisons can be performed, viz. x = a, x &gt;a, x i^a, X 
 <br><br>
The latency unit LAT is shown in fig. 26 and is used for delaying a positive binary value res_ for a certain number of cycles. The register 9 contains the latency and the counter 8 is used for counting down from the time when a positive result is registered, res gives the modified result signal and the "        signal _reset resets the counter to 0. The Verilog code which implements the<br><br>
latency unit LAT is shown in table A4 of the appendix and an explanation of the interface given by its inputs and outputs is evident from table 3.<br><br>
The document management unit DOC is shown in fig. 27. It is used for letting the search processor circuit keeping track of various documents. The three comparator units or a suffix thereof are set to match a tag indicating a new document and the signal doc is set equal to 0 when this tag appears. The figure is slightly modified, as when less than three characters are used in a tag, the comparator unit or units farthest to the left shall not influence the result. The latency shall be set equal to the number of characters in the tag, viz 1 to 3. The Verilog code which implements this unit is given in table A5 of the appendix and an explanation ofthe interface given by its inputs and outputs is evident from table 4.<br><br><br>
The look-up table unit LUT with 8 inputs is shown in fig. 28. res gives the result. The Verilog code for the look-up table unit is given in table A6 of the appendix, while an explanation of the interface given by its inputs and outputs is evident from table 5.<br><br><br>
The sequence control unit SC is used for realizing the following three possibility:<br>
â€¢	Requiring that the preceding or a succeeding processing circuit or comparator unit reports a match before allowing the current to report a match.<br>
â€¢	Allowing matching of patterns where certain parts of the pattern may be missing.<br>
â€¢	Allowing matching of patterns where certain parts of the pattern may be<br>
repeated.<br>
The sequence control unit SC is placed together with a processing circuit which can be a single kernel processor or comparator unit or a group of processing circuits as well as a set of flip-flops. The number of flip-flops shall be equal the number of characters matched by the processing circuit. This is shown in fig. 29. A sei^uence control unit SC can hence be implemented as shown in fig. 30. Here three result values and values from the present and previous flip-flops are used as inputs and a new result value is output. It is now quite simply a matter of specifying the behaviour of the sequence control unit SC which is purely combinatorial.<br>
Truth tables for five cases, viz. no sequence control, forward sequence control, backward sequence control, matching of repeated patterns and matching of skipped patterns are respectively shown in the tables 6-10,<br><br><br><br>
Even if it is not shown in the tables, the output^_oÂ«; in the first three cases shall be set equal to the output from the flip-flops in a previous processing circuit for allowing flip-flop values to flow through parts of the system. Based on the appended truth value tables, the symbolic forms shown in table 11 are easily derived. The resulting sequence control unit is shov/n in fig. 30 and the multiplexer here chooses between 5 operation modes, numbered from right to left and from top to bottom as shown in table 11.<br><br><br><br>
The result selector RS is used for combining two result values from processing circuits or other results selectors. The following operations shall be supported:<br>
â€¢	Using only the first result.<br>
â€¢	Using only the second result.<br>
â€¢	Performing the boolean operation AND on two results.<br>
â€¢	Performing the boolean operation OR on two results.<br>
â€¢	Performing the operation 
â€¢	Performing the operation &gt; over a set of processing circuits.<br>
The first four operations can be handled directly, the others are more complicated. Fig. 31 shows an example of how it is possible to match all strings alphabetically/numerically larger than 1990. To start with selector RS2; if the character which is matched by the ngthmost processing unit and which is the leftmost digit in the number that is being matched, is larger than 1, this means that the whole number is larger and this will be the result. In this example they ar equal and the other processing circuits decide. Selector RS2 thus returns equality. Selector RSI once again follows the same principle. Here the second selector RS2 returns equality, while the first selector RSI returns that the value is larger and this is the result from RSI. Sflpntnr RS3 doRs the same and resturns that a number greater than 1990 has<br><br>
been found. For cases where alphabetic a!/numerical comparisons are made is res given as res = eq2res\ Â± eqlresl.<br>
Based on the above features, the result selector implemented will look as shown m fig. 32. The multiplexer MUX4 selects between the five operation modes; selects first result, selects the second result and performs the AND operation on results, performs the OR operation on results and performs string comparison.<br>
The Verilog code which implements this unit is shown in table A8 of the appendix and an explanation of the interface given by its inputs and outputs are evident from table 13. The document signals are now used together with the document management unit to avoid acceptance of results which cross document borders.<br><br>
The processing circuit according to the invention is shown in fig. 33. It consists of at least one comparator unit COM, one latency unit LAT, D flip-flops 2,4, a sequence control unit SC and a result selector RS. A block<br><br>
version of the processing circuit with inputs and outputs is shown in fig.34. The Verilog code which implements the processing circuit is given in table A9 of the appendix, and an explanation of the interface given by its inputs and outputs is evident from table 14.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
A data tree, i.e. a search processor circuit PMC according to the invention in the form of a multiprocessor unit Pn is shown in fig,35. The multiprocessor unit IS configured as a tree and consists therein of eight processing units Pn_|, a sequence control unit SC, a latency unit LAT and a LUT. The circuit Pn or the data tree which may be denominated as "TreeS" has precisely the same interface as the processing circuits and this means that each processing circuit in the tree can be replaced by a tree of this kind, such that the tree can consist of any number of levels. This again implies that the data tree shall comprise a number of nested circuits P^.^, such that each circuit on an underlying level S^.q is nested in a circuit on the overlying level S|,.q+], if the data tree itself forms the highest level, namely the level Sâ€ž and q e{l,2,,--,ni. If the tree is a regular tree, e.g. a binary tree, the processing circuit Pâ€ž.q on a level will map the processing circuit Pn-q+i on the overlying level S|]-qM recursively and in case of a binary tree of course with a mapping factor of 2. As the general search problem, as mentioned in the introduction, can be regarded as a binary partitionable problem, it is of course nothing against managing a partitioning problem of this kind with for instance a tree where the degree is not 2, but 4,8, 16 etc., a circumstance which here is called superbinary. Generally one has the degree k = 2"", where m for superbinary trees are an integer greater than 1, in other words k &gt; 2. In a recursive mapping the mapping factor is of course r = k. The tree in fig, 35 may for instance be regarded as a processor with two levels S|, S2, as the first level comprises the eight processing circuits Pi which then again for instance each corresponds to the processing circuit in fig. 33, and consequently each comprises only one kernel processor or one comparator element COM.The kernel processors are thus the leaf nodes of the tree and forms the zeroth level So in the tree, realized by the circuits Po on the zeroth level in the tree, while the processing circuit P] comprises a kernel processing unit Po and a logic element E, represented by the remaining components in the processing circuit in fig. 33. On the level S2 the circuit is identical with the search processor itself and this then in addition to the eight processing circuits Pi on<br><br>
the level S] itself comprises a logic unit E substantially comprising the mentioned sequence control unit SC, a latency unit LAT and a LUT. Such described the multiprocessor unit P^ in fig. 35 becomes a symmetric and balanced reduced tree, as each processing circuit Pi only comprises a single comparator unit. It is, however, nothing against that the search processor circuit or the treeS is realized as a regular unreduced tree of degree 8 and then the eight processing circuits Pi, on the first level each would comprise eight kernel processors or comparator units Po, such that it will be 64 in total. If the tree is extended with yet a level and regularity kept, the zeroth level So would come out with 512 kernel processors or comparator units, the first level Si with 64 processing circuit P|, the second level Sj with 8 processing circuits Pi and the search processor unit circuit would be made up of the circuit Vi on the level S3. The Verilog code which implements the ireeS as shown in fig. 35 is given in the table AlO of the appendix and an explanation of the interface of the search processing circuit as given by its inputs and output is evident from table 15.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
If the search processor for instance is realized with, respectively 64 or 512 kernel processors, the search processor can very well be realized as a nested circuit in the form of a regular tree with the mapping factor 8, but can also be realized directly as respectively a tree64 or a tree512. In any case the Verilog code for a search processor with 64 kernel processors shown in table Al 1 of the appendix, while the Verilog code for a search processor with 512 kernel processors is shown in table A12 of the appendix.<br><br>
The hit management unit HIT is shown in fig. 36. The flip-flop is here used to keep track of whether the next unit shall be reported or not. The Verilog code which implements the hit management unit is shown in table A13 of the appendix and an explanation of the interface given by its inputs and outputs )        is evident in table 16.<br><br>
How respectively the document management unit DOC and the hit management unit HIT is provided in a search processing circuit PMC in the form of a multiprocessor unit ?â€ž or a treeS as shown in fig.35 is evident from the appended fig. 37. For reasons of clarity is only the connection between DOC and HIT and the multiprocessor unit shown in fig 37, while the remaining signal lines have been left out. It will there be seen that the search processor circuit PMC in addition to the multiprocessor unit Pp here comprises a document management unit DOC which via a data output is connected with respectively the sequential and the parallel data input on the multiprocessor unit Vâ€ž and via a document output with the sequential document input on the multiprocessor unit P^. Further, the search processor circuit PMC also comprises "Ak = 2*""" = 2^"" = 4 hit management units<br><br>
HITl-4 connected with respectively result outputs and document outputs on the processing circuits P^_i, each hit management unit HIT via a result output being connected with respective result outputs in the interface of the search processor circuit, A hit management unit is in addition schematically shown in fig. 21 and discussed in connection therewith. Further, the provision of the hit management unit HIT in a search processor circuit PMC realized as a multiprocessor circuit with tree structure shown in fig. 23, and there has in connection with this figure already been described how the hit management unit can be used for reporting results from multiple questions. It shall hence not be treated more closely here. It shall, however, be remarked that hit management units only are provided in the black nodes, while the white nodes in fig. 23 distributes their results as shown with the arrows.<br>
It is thus on the input of two of the hit management units as shown in fig. 37 provided one respective two multiplexers.<br>
In a practical implementation on a circuit chip the search processor circuit PMC according to the invention preferably will be realized as a superbinary tree with k for instance equal to 2 , 2"" or 2^ and hence appear as a superbinary tree with a balanced reduction on the zeroth level. This again implies that the multiprocessor unit P,i becomes equal to P2 and forms respectively a trecS with 8 processor units P|, or a tree64 with 64 processing units Pi or a tree512 with 512 processing units P| which in their turn each comprises a single comparator unit COM. On the zeroth level is hence the tree reduced. Then also the logic unit E in each processing circuit Pi can be realized with only one single sequence control unit SC, apart from flip-flops, the multiplexer MUXl, the latency unit LAT and the result selector RS.<br>
Finally it shall be remarked that the multiprocessor unit P,, in the search processor circuit PMC according of the invention forms a special case of multiprocessor architectures based on tree networks of arbitrary degree and with an arbitrary number of levels, such these are disclosed in the above-mentioned Indian patent application No. IN/PCT/2001/00562CHE (Halaas &amp; a!.) which belongs to the present applicant and which derives priority from NO patent application No. 19984746 of 9 October 1998. A particular feature of a multiple processor architecture of this kind is that the single data processors only is provided on the zeroth levels in the tree<br><br>
structure or correspond to the processing circuits on the first level in the tree structure if the tree is a reduced tree. If the reduction is symmetric and balanced on the zeroth level So, the circuit is additionally generated recursively on overlying levels S;, ...Sâ€ž by the processing circuit Pi on the level Si- Such circuits can be implemented with particularly good economy to handle data processing problems with arbitrary degree of partitioning, the classical search problem of course, being a generally binary partitionable data processing problem..<br>
With basis in Halaas &amp; al, a kernel processor Po hence formally will correspond to the connection in fig.8 and comprises in addition to the processor proper the comparator unit COM, a latency unit LAT, a sequence control SC, the necessary number of flip-flops 2, 4 and logic gates 1, 3 as shown in fig, 38. for each comparator unit COM it must, of course, be provided a sequence control unit SC, cf fig. 29, The processing circuit P| in fig,  33 could thus in reality comprise two or possibly more comparator units with a logic unit E provided with the corresponding number of sequence control units SC, The interface of a circuit PQ with a comparator unit COM which formally is the kernel processor proper 17 and a sequence control unit SC will then be given by the inputs and the outputs of the circuits such they are evident from table 17,<br><br><br><br>
In practice the search processor circuit PMC according to the present invention is implemented as an integrated circuit chip solution and preferably this is realised as a superfainary tree where the processing circuits P| on the level S| has only a single comparator COM. All actual processing (search and matching operations) then take place on this level. An implementation where the search processor circuit F^ = Pi, i.e. formally with 3 levels, forms a superbinary tree with for instance 512 processing circuits Pi, further provides an extremely good degree of exploitation of the circuit chip.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
