3.   PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br><br>
New combinations and new use of selected pharmaceutically active compounds Field of application of the invention The invention relates to new dfe of certain selected tricyclic imidazo [1,2-a] pyridine compounds in the prevention or treatment of medicament caused gastrointestinal teases and/or medicament associ- ated gastrointestinal disorders, to new use of said compounds in combination therapy, and to new combinations comprising said selected tricyclic imidazo [1,2-a] pyridine compounds. Known technical background Tricyclic imidazo [1,2-a] pyridine compounds are known from prior art as reversible proton pump inhibi- tors and acid pump antagonists. The use of tricyclic imidazo [1, 2-a] pyridine compounds in the prevention or treatment of medicament caused gastrointestinal diseases is known from a variety of prior art documents such as, for example, the international applications WO 9842707, WO 0017200, WO 0026217, WO 0063211, WO 0172756, WO 0172755, WO 0172757, WO 0234749, WO 03014120, WO 03014123, WO 03016310 and WO 03091253. Abovementioned international applications describe tricyclic imidazo [1, 2-a] pyridine compounds which are said to exhibit a marked inhibition of gastric acid secretion and an excellent gastric and intestinal protective action. In this connection, abovementioned international applications teach also the utiliza- bility of these compounds particularly in the prevention or treatment of gastrointestinal inflammatory diseases and lesions which are caused by medicaments. In particular, abovementioned international applications disclose in a specific way the utilizability of tricyclic imidazo [1, 2-a] pyridine compounds in the prevention or treatment of stomach ulcers, duodenal ulcers or medicament related functional gas- tropathy, which are caused by certain antiinflammatories and antirheumatics. The international application WO 02/069968 describes the use of generically disclosed and stereo- chemically undefined tricyclic imidazo [1,2-a] pyridine compounds, which are substituted in 3-position with a hydroxy-1-4C-alkyl radical on the imidazo ring, in the prevention of gastric ulcer induced by certain medicaments. International application WO 02/069968 also claims combinations comprising said medicaments and generically disclosed and stereochemically undefined tricyclic imidazo [1,2- pyridine compounds, which are said to be useful in the prevention of medicament induced gastric ulcer. J. J. Kaminski et al., J. Med. Chem. 1985, 28,876-892, describe the cytoprotective properties of cer- tain imidazopyridines. There is still a severe need in the art of having drugs with good tolerance on the gastrointestinal sys- tern.<br>
Description of the invention Surprisingly and unanticipatedly, it has now been found that certain purposively selected, specifically disclosed and stereochemically predominantly well-defined tricyclic imidazo [1,2-a] pyridine com- pounds, which are described in greater detail below, have, as a first aspect (aspect 1) of the present invention, advantageous gastro-protective action against certain medicaments (such as, for example, those medicaments mentioned below in the description of this invention, especially antiinflammatoriies and antirheumatics, and/or, in particular, those medicaments which cause erosive changes and/or lesions in the gastrointestinal system) and/or are well useful and effective in prevention or treatment of gastrointestinal disorders associated with certain medicaments indicated below and/or are particularly useful and effective in prevention or treatment of gastrointestinal diseases caused by certain medica- ments selected from the group consisting of NSAIDs (non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs), COX-2 (cydooxygenase 2) inhibitors, NO-NSAIDs (nitric oxide releasing NSAID), bisphosphonates and corti- costeroids, in particular caused by certain medicaments selected from the group consisting of NSAIDs, COX-2 inhibitors, NO-NSAIDs and bisphosphonates; and/or can be used, as a second aspect (aspect 2) of the present invention, in combination therapy of diseases and/or disorders which can be treated, ameliorated or prevented with said certain medicaments mentioned above in aspect 1, particularly with those medicaments selected from the group consisting of NSAIDs (non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs), COX-2 (cydooxygenase 2) inhibitors, NO-NSAIDs (nitric oxide releasing NSAID), bisphospho- nates and corticosteroids, whereby said combination therapy is characaterized by improved gastroin- testinal safety and tolerance compared to monotherapy. Unexpectedly it has been found in this context, that the gastrointestinal safety and tolerability of a combination or composition comprising (a) at least one tricyclic imidazo [1,2-a] pyridine compound as defined herein, and (b) an agent selected from the group consisting of NSAIDs, COX-2 inhibitors, NO- NSAIDs, bisphosphonates and corticostereoids is greater than that can be achieved with said agent (b) alone, i. e. greater than the gastrointestinal safety and tolerability of a monotherapy using only said agent (b) unpartnered with said tricyclic imidazo [1, 2-a] pyridine compound (a). Within the scope of this invention, the term"selected, specifically disclosed and sterochemically well defined tricyclic imidazo [1, 2-a] pyridine compounds'Yefers in a first embodiment (embodiment a) of the present invention to those tricyclic imidazo [1,2-a] pyridine compounds, which are selected from a group consisting of those tricyclic imidazo [1,2-a] pyridine compounds which are specifically disclosed and/or individualized and/or claimed in the following patent applications and patents: WO 9842707, WO 0017200, WO 0026217, WO 0063211, WO 0172756, WO 0172755, WO 0172757, WO 0234749, WO 03014120, WO 03014123, WO 03016310 and WO 03091253, and which are not substituted by a hydroxy-1-4C-alkyl radical bonded on the imidazo ring; and/or to those compounds which are mentioned expressis verbis in the list A below; and to the salts, solvates and solvates of the salts of these compounds.

Within the scope of this invention,"inflammatory diseases"which may be mentioned are gastrointesti- nal inflammatory diseases such as, for example, inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, irrita- ble bowel syndrome, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and ulcerative colitis, or non- gastrointestinal inflammatory diseases, in particular arthritis, including but not limited to rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and juvenile arthritis ; or asthma, bronchitis and skin related disorders such as psoriasis, eczema, burns and dermatitis. "Inflammation associated disorders"which may be mentioned are, for example, pain (bbth chronic and acute), migraine, fever and headaches. Furthermore, the person skilled in the art knows on the base of his/her expert knowledge which dis- eases, disorders or conditions can be treated, ameliorated or prevented by NSAIDs, COX-2 inhibitors, NO-NSAIDs, bisphosphonates or corticosteroids. Illustratively, as examples may be mentioned in this connection by way of example, without being restricted thereto, inflammatory, rheumatic or pain dis- eases. According to the present invention, agents selected from the group consisting of NSAIDs, CQX-2 in- hibitors, NO-NSAIDs, bisphosphonates and corticosteroids can be combined beneficially with agents selected from the group consisting of certain tricyclic imidazo [1,2-a] pyridine compounds mentioned in the description of this invention to enhance or to improve safety and tolerability of the monotherapy, i. e. the monotherapy using only said agents selected from the group consisting of NSAIDs, COX-2 inhibitors, NO-NSAIDs, bisphosphonates and corticosteroids unpartriered with said tricyclic imi- dazo [1,2-a] pyridine compounds, by redcucing the risk of adverse effects, such as medicament- associated gastrointestinal disorders or medicament-caused gastrointestinal diseases, associated con- ventionally with the monotherapy. In this context, the skilled person knows therefore on the base of his/her expert knowledge and/or on the base of the diclosure of the present invention which diseases, disorders or conditions convention- ally treated, ameliorated or prevented monotherapeutically with NSAIDs, COX-2 inhibitors, NO- NSAIDs, bisphosphonates or corticosteroids can be now beneficially treated, ameliorated or prevented co-therapeutically, i. e. with the combination therapy according to the present invention. In more detail, the combination therapy according to this invention can be applied to treat diseases, disorders or conditions which can originally be treated, ameliorated or prevented by NSAIDs and/or COX-2 inhibitors, such as, for example, inflammatory diseases (in particular all kind of arthritis includ- ing rheumatoid arthritis or degenerative joint diseases including osteoarthritis) or inflammation associ- ated disorders, and/or particularly symptoms caused by arthritis, such as inflammation, swelling, stiff- ness and joint pain, or other kinds of pain or painful conditions, such as e. g. gout attacks; bursitis, tendonitis, touthache, migraine, lower back and neck pain, myositis, sprains, strains or other injuries, or symptoms associated with influenza or other viral infections or common cold. As further diseases, disorders or conditions, which can be treated, ameliorated or prevented by NSAIDs and/or, particularly, COX-2 inhibitors within the combination therapy according to this inven- tion, can be mentioned, without being restricted thereto, neuropathic pains, (inflammatory) liver dis- eases, stroke, epilepsy, dysmenorrhoea, ophthalmic diseases, cognitive disorders such as dementia, particularly degenerative dementia (such e. g. Alzheimer's disease) or, in more particular, cellular and neoplastic transformation and metastatic tumour growth, such e. g. certain cancerous diseases, for example colonic cancer and prostate cancer, or cancer associated with overexpression of HER-2/neu (e. g. breast cancer), or adenomatous colorectal polyps (and to reduce herewith the risk of developing colon cancer), or other conditions mediated by COX-2 (such as, e. g. conditions mediated by COX-2 overexpression during carcinogenesis). As diseases, disorders or conditions, which can be treated, ameliorated or prevented by bisphospho- nates within the combination therapy according to this invention, can be mentioned, without being restricted thereto, disorders associated with abnormal bone resorption such as, for example, osteopo- rosis, multiple myeloma or metastatic bone diseases (e. g. prostata, lung or breast cancer related), or tumor-induced hypercalcemia. Oral corticosteroids can be used, for example, to treat autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, in- eluding asthma, bursitis, Crohn's disease, tendinitis, ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, and lupus, and skin conditions, such as eczema and psoriasis. They can also be used to reduce inflammation associated with severe allergic reactions and to prevent organ rejection following transplant surgery. 1141WOORD01 20044110 56 Furthermore, the present invention provides also a teaching to broaden the primary therapeutic use of NSAIDs, COX-2 inhibitors, NO-NSAIDs, bisphosphonates or corticosteroids originally restricted due to risk of medicament caused gastrointestinal diseases. It is to be understood, that this broadened therapeutic use is also encompassed within the scope of this invention. A further aspect of this invention is the combination of the abovementioned (pharmaceutical) composi- tions, pharmaceutical products, formulations, combinations, commercial packages or kits according to the invention with pharmaceuticals which inhibit acid secretion, such as, for example, H2 blockers (e. g. cimetidine, ranitidine), H*/K'ATPase inhibitors (e. g. omeprazole, pantoprazole), or furthermore with so-called peripheral anticholinergics (e. g. pirenzepine, telenzepine) and also with gastrin antagonists with the aim of increasing the main action in an additive or superadditive sense and/or eliminating or decreasing the side effects. Within the meaning of this invention the terms"use","administration","coadministration"or"adminis- tering"refer preferably to oral application. However in some cases, parenteral (e. g. intravenious), rectal or percutaneous application can be also advantageous. The dosage of the active compounds is in a customary order of magnitude comparable with the monodosagea, whereby, due to the additive and/or superadditive synergism of the single effects, the relevant doses of the active compounds in the combined dosage can be reduced compared to norm, or whereby-while maintaining the customary doses of the single components-a<br>
                                                                                               17<br><br>
surprisingly higher and prolonged effect is obtained. The person skilled in the art is aware on the base of his expert knowledge of the total daily dosage<br>
ke NSAIDs, the COX-2 inhibitors, the NO-NSAIDs, the bisphosphonates or the corticosteroids which are comprised in the abovementioned armaceutical) compositions, pharmaceutical products, for- mulatons, combinations, preparations, commercial packages or kits according to this invention. Said total daily dosage can vary within a wide range. For example, in the case of Diclofenac the daily doses are in a range from 100-2000 ug/kg.in general, it has proven advantageous in human medicine to administer said selected tricyclic imi- dazo [1,2-a] pyridine compounds in the case of oral administration in a daily dose from approximately 0.01 to approximately 20, preferably 0.05 to 5, in particular 0.1 to 1.5, mg/kg of body weight, if appro- priate in the form of several, preferably 1 to 4, individual doses to achieve the desired result. In the case of parenteral treatment, similar or (in particular in the case of intravenous administration of the active compounds), as a rule, lower doses can be used. The optimal dose and manner of administration of the active compounds necessary in each case can easily be determined by any person skilled in the art on the basis of his/her expert knowledge. The person skilled in the art is familiar, on the basis of his/her knowledge, with carriers, diluents, adjuvants, auxiliaries or excipients which are suitable for the desired pharmaceutical compositions, formulaflons and/or preparations. Beside solvents, gel-forming agents, suppository bases, tablet auxiliaries and other active carriers, it is possible to use, for example, antioxidants, dispersants, emulsifiers, anti- foams, flavor corrigents, preservatives, solubilizers, colorants or, in particular, permeation promoters and complexing agents (e. g. cyclodextrines). In medicines, the active compounds are preferably employed in the form of tablets, coated tablets, capsules, suppositories, patches, emulsions, suspensions, gels or solutions, the active compound content advantageously being between 0.1 and 95%. Thus, for example with regard to the desired mode and site of action, the person skilled in the art can develop, on the basis of his/her knowledge, by appropriate choice of the excipients and the auxiliaries different galenic forms precisely tailored to the active ingredient (s) (such as, for example, retard forms or gastric acid resistant forms). A medicament or a pharmaceutical composition according to this invention can refer to a composition comprising both the said tricyclic imidazo [1,2-a] pyridine compound and the other active ingredient in a fixed combination (fixed unit dosage form), or a medicament pack comprising the two active ingredi- ents as discrete separate dosage forms. In case of a medicament pack comprising the two active in- gredients, the active ingredients are preferably packed into blister cards which are suited for improving compliance. Each blister card preferably contains the medicaments to be taken on one day of treatment. If the medicaments are to be taken at different times of day, the medicaments can be disposed in different sections on the blister card according to the different ranges of times of day at which the medicaments are to be taken (for example morning and evening or morning, midday and evening). The blister cavi- ties for the medicaments to be taken together at a particular time of day are accommodated in the respective range of times of day. The various times of day are, of course, also put on the blister in a clearly visible way. It is also possible, of course, for example to indicate a period in which the medicaments are to be taken, for example stating the times. The daily sections may represent one line of the blister card, and the times of day are then identified in chronological sequence in this column.<br>
Medicaments which must be taken together at a particular time of day are placed together at the ap- propriate time on the blister card, preferably a narrow distance apart, allowing them to be pushed out of the blister easily, and having the effect that removal of the dosage form from the blister is not for- gotten.

Examples These experiments were done according to the procedure described in principle by Shay et al. Gas- troenterology 1945, 5, 43-61, modified by Okabe et al. Jp. J. Pharmacol. 1974,24, 363-371. Rats wfire deprived of food 24 hours prior to the experiment with free access to water. After a midline abdominal incision under short isoflurane (Abbott no. B506) anaesthesia, the pylorus was ligated and the test substance or-regarding the control group-the vehicle (physiological saline) were given in-traduodenaiiy in 2.5 ml/kg body weight. The abdomen was closed and 100 mg/kg of acetylsalicylic acid [ASA (Merck no. 85); suspended in 10 mi/kg of 1% Na^carboxymethylcellulose C1000P (Hoechst no. E0842965) solution] were administered orally. 4 hours after ligation, the stomach was carefully excised under isoflurane anaesthesia (keeping the esophagus closed with a vessel forceps), opened along the greater curvature, and the gastric contents were removed. The animals were then sacrificed by atlas dislocation. The mucosa was flushed with saline and the stomach pinned on a styropor plate. The length and width of each gastric lesion was determined with a stereo-microscope using a 10-fold magnification. Each lesion was classified using the following score system: (Length + width)/2 = point no lesion = 0 0.1-1.4 mm = 1 1.5-2. 4 mm = 2 2.5-3.4 mm = 3 3.5-4.4 mm = 4 4.5-5. 4 mm = 5 25. 5mm =6 The sum of all points per animal represents the individual lesion index. Conditions under which the animals were kept: Groups of 4 female rats per cage (Macrolon cage Milt) were kept at about 22°C and a relative humid- ity of 50-60%. They were fed ad libitum with NAFAG feed No. 9439 (NAFAG AG, CH-9200 Gossau, Switzerland) and had free access to water. Food was withdrawn 24 h before start of the experiment. Exemplary substance preparation : (7R, 8R, 9R)-8-Hydroxy-7- (2-methoxyethoxy)-2, 3-dimethyl-9-phenyl-7, 8,9,10-tetrahydro-imidazo [1, 2-h]- [\\ 7] naphthyridine was dissolved in DMSO and 0.1 N HCI immediately before the start of the exped- ment. The solution was further diluted with physiological saline and administered to the animals in a constant volume of 2.5 ml/kg body weight<br>
