Field of invention<br>
The present disclosure relates to the field of electro-mechanical engineering. The present invention more specifically relates to thermal management in miniaturized electrical and electromagnetic relay devices.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
In the field of enclosed miniaturized electrical or Electromechanical devices, it is generally required that temperatures inside the enclosure does not rise above a maximum allowable level. Since all devices produce heat  some more than others, thermal issues are very important to the electrical enclosure designer.<br>
PCB based miniaturized electromechanical devices produce heat during use and need cooling to prevent the increase of temperature in the device as well as the surrounding environment from becoming very high. Some devices like relays transformers and inductors also have winding or coil and the heat generated in these windings must also be dissipated. Moreover as the windings are wound coated with an insulating material, the heat dissipation is generally poor. Internally it must either transfer across several layers of insulation or along the winding conductive path and into the wiring or bussing connected to the device. None of these heat flow paths are particularly efficient.<br>
Heat dissipation becomes increasingly important when miniaturized electromagnetic devices operate at high power levels. High temperatures generated by these devices limit the power levels at which they can operate. This is especially true in high power density equipment operating in high ambient temperature or in applications where active cooling is required. Heatsinks are known for cooling electronic equipment, but are generally only useful for removing heat from exposed surfaces of a device. Typically, these heat sink devices physically contact with components on a substrate such as a circuit board and are constructed of a thermally conductive material, such as metal (e.g., copper or aluminum).<br>
Since all electrical devices produce heat, some more than others, thermal issues are very important to the electrical enclosure designer. Such heat, however, is detrimental to many electrical components such as integrated circuits or optical devices.<br>
 <br>
In many instances the physical size of the enclosure must be increased to accommodate the desired number of devices, or reduce the number of electrical devices inside the enclosure in order to maintain a temperature below the maximum allowable rise. Added constraints like small available thermal volume, hermetical sealing and negligible buoyancy effect, compactness of the product add to the problems of the thermal management of the electromagnetic devices. Therefore, it would be desirable to develop a relatively simple thermal management system that would permit the electrical devices to be enclosed in the smallest or most efficient electrical enclosure without exceeding the maximum allowable temperature rise.<br>
A novel and inventive way of thermal management in the electromagnetic devices with hollow structures that use pyrolytic graphite, is provided as the apt solution herein. The novel use of pyrolytic graphite with a specific inventive design of the structure is found be manage heat and lower the temperature of the electromagnetic device.<br>
Summary of the invention:<br>
Thermal pyrolytic graphite [TPG] has its origin of usage in the spacecraft industry since the last decade. Carbon products are anisotropic and as a function of their molecular structure that they can conduct 3-4 times that of copper. This thermal conduction behavior is enhanced further with the process of annealing it [Annealed TPG is called as APG[K=1700W/mK]].<br>
The present disclosure defines an electromagnetic device for improved thermal management, the device comprising a conductor and a casing, wherein it comprises atleast one structure comprising plurality of coaxial hollow members one within the other, the alternate coaxial members being mounted perpendicularly on the conductor and the other coaxial members being mounted perpendicularly on a plate on the internal surface of the casing. Such hollow coaxial members upon getting assembled are placed within each other without physically touching and transfer heat effectively through radiation and convection i.e., the heat available at the coaxial member that is mounted on<br>
 <br>
the conductor side is convected as well as radiated into hollow coaxial member that protrudes from the casing side. This is due to the arrangement that one coaxial member during assembly protrudes into the hollow portion of another. In small volume electromechanical devices, such structures transferring heat through radiation and convection is found to be highly feasible. The structures and plates are made of TPG material.<br>
In another embodiment of the disclosure an electromagnetic device for improved thermal management is defined. The device comprising an input leg, a output leg and a third leg for fixing the device on a circuit board, wherein plates mounted in perpendicular to the input or output leg and the plates being parallel to each other, the alternate plates being mounted on the input leg and the other plates being mounted with the output leg, all the plates being mounted on the third leg. These plates<br>

Detailed description of the invention;<br>
Heat tends to move from a high-temperature region to a low-temperature region. This heat transfer may occur by the mechanisms of conduction, convection and radiation. Heat conduction or thermal conduction is the spontaneous transfer of thermal energy through matter, from a region of higher temperature to a region of lower temperature, and acts to equalize temperature differences. It is also described as heat energy transferred from one material to another by direct contact.<br>
 <br>
Heat convection is a due to the presence of an intermediate fluidic medium such as air, which remove the heat from the source as a function of its properties such as velocity, viscosity, density, thermal conductivity, thermal storage capacity etc.<br>
Thermal radiation is electromagnetic radiation emitted from the surface of an object that is due to the object's temperature. If an object is hotter than its surroundings it emits more radiation than it absorbs, and tends to cool.<br>
Thermal pyrolytic graphite [TPG] has its origin of usage in the spacecraft industry since the last decade. Carbon products are anisotropic and as a function of their molecular structure they can conduct 3-4 times that of copper. This thermal conduction behavior is enhanced further with the process of annealing it [Annealed TPG is called as APG [K=1700W/mK]].<br>
However this kind of conduction behavior is anisotropic i.e., Kx = 1700 W/mK; Ky = 1700 W/mK; Kz = 20 to 50 W/mK]. Those TPG sheets act as the features that diffuse the I^R heat energy available in the conductor portion of the electromechanical devices based on their high thermal conductivity. The thermal conduction of TPG is 3-4 times that of copper.<br>
In the  conduction governing  equation i.e.,  Fourier's  formulae  Q=KA  [dT/dx], K<br>
dramatically increases that the thermal diffusion is quite high. Also as the diffusion<br>
increases, the I R heat is available over a larger cross sectional area that the convection as<br>
well as radiation efficiencies also proportionately increase. To explain, in the governing<br>
equations for convection and radiation<br>
Q = h A [dT]<br>
Q=EAF,-2 [Ts^-Ta^]<br>
A is directly proportional to Q that thermal efficiency increases considerably with this<br>
innovation.<br>
 <br>
In fig 1, the electromagnetic device is accordance to the preset invention is described. The electromagnetic device like a relay has a conductor (1) and casing (2). This device is mounted on to the circuit board or for that matter any other board. A plurality of structures (4) in accordance to the present invention is shown. This structure comprises of plurality of coaxial members that is made of high conduction materials such as Pyrolytic Graphite, especially Thermal Pyrolytic Graphite (TPG) or Annealed Pyrolytic Graphite (APG). Further the internal of the casing is provided with a Sheet (3) of Pyrolytic Graphite that is extended and grounded on the circuit board.<br>
The invention can be practiced by means of at least one structure is present which has at least one member. However in the present embodiment the invention is explained by means of plurality of structures and each structure having three coaxial members. The members are spaced at a predetermined uniform distance thus avoiding contact between the members.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the legs of the electromagnetic device which enables the device to be placed on the circuit board (15) are provided plates for heat dissipation. The plates are of uniform size and are placed at a predetermined uniform distance from each other. This distance is calculated with respect to the device used and thus may vary with each device.<br>
Fig 2 describes the device and shows the three legs namely the input leg (11), the output leg (12) and the third leg (13). The plates (14) are mounted perpendicular to the legs and the plates are parallel to each other, thus avoiding contact between the plates. The alternate plates (141,143,145) are mounted on the input leg and supported with the third leg. The remaining plate (142,144) are mounted in perpendicular to the output leg and also supported on the third leg.<br>
This design of plates (141-145) allows for radiation of heat from members. The plates mounted on the legs dissipate heat by conduction as they are in contact with the on the legs. These plates are parallel to the other members and thus they dissipate heat through radiation. Further the sheets mounted on the input leg are not in contact with the input leg<br>
 <br>
and similarly the coaxial members mounted on the sheet are not in contact with the conductor. This is to prevent any grounding and shorting of the device.<br>
It is clear that the plates which are mounted on the input leg are not in contact with the output legs and similarly the plates mounted on the output legs are touching the input legs.<br>
Fig 3 shows the cross section side view of the present invention. The sectional side view with the structure is also shown. This clearly shows the coaxial members mounted on the conductor are at a specified distance from the high conduction plate and the coaxial members mounted on the high conduction plate. Similarly the coaxial members mounted on the high conduction plate on the casing are at a distance from the conductor and the coaxial members mounted on the conductor. Therefore though the coaxial members are placed one within each other they do not touch any other coaxial member.<br>
Fig 4 &amp; 5 describes the cross-section view of the present invention clearly defining the structure (4) on the conductor and the casing respectively. The structures can be of rectangular, square, circular or triangular cross section as shown in the figure 4 «&amp; 5. They may be or other shapes which can be easily construed and designed by any person skilled in the art. The different cross sections are shown here on the single device, however they may be manufactured as a single or a combination of different structural cross-section on an electromagnetic device. Further the invention contains three coaxial members.<br>
Figure 4 shows the members mounted on the conductor surface. The alternate members (21,23) are mounted on the conductor surface. The present invention is defined by three coaxial members (21,22,23), therefore in the present invention the first and the third member is mounted on the conductor. The present invention can also be practiced with any number of coaxial members per structure as suitable for the device. It is preferred to use but the alternate members are mounted on the conductor. However it is preferred to include the larger number of members on the conductor side. E.g. if the structure contains 5 coaxial members, the first third and fifth members are mounted on the conducting surface.<br>
 <br>
Fig 5 shows the members mounted on the sheet formed with the internal surface of the casing. The remaining coaxial members (22) that were not mounted on the conducting surface are mounted on the sheet.<br>
This design of coaxial members allows for convection and radiation of heat along members. The members mounted on the conductor dissipate heat by conduction as they are in contact with the on the conductor. The alternate members are parallel to the other members and thus they dissipate heat through convection and radiation. Since the members are not in contact with each other, the convection and radiation occurs through air between them. This effects in faster cooling of the conductor through both conduction and radiation. Further the coaxial members mounted on the conductor are not in contact with the sheet. Similarly the coaxial members mounted on the sheet are not in contact with the conductor. This is to prevent any grounding and shorting of the device.<br>
When a prototype was built using this concept design, temperature reduction of 20% i.e 16-17'C was evident even in a very small air volume. The ambient temperature was kept as a constant at 25'C in all trials. Thus it is proved that the present design provides a high reduction of heat.<br>
The description of the disclosed embodiments is provided to enable any person skilled in the art to make or use the present disclosure. Various modifications to these embodiments will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art, and the generic principles defined herein may be applied to other embodiments without departing from the spirit or scope of the disclosure. Thus, the present disclosure is not intended to be limited to the embodiments shown herein but is to be accorded the widest scope consistent with the principles and novel features disclosed herein.<br>
