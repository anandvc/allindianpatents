Power Generator Unit composed of a Generator and<br>
a Piston internal Combustion Engine as the Drive<br>
The invention relates to a power generator unit composed of a generator<br>
and a piston interna! combustion engine as the drive, particularly<br>
composed of a synchronous generator and a diesel engine, with<br>
permanent magnets arranged in the rotor of the generator, in the area of<br>
the poles, for its excitation, and a rotor winding in the stator.<br>
Such a power generator unit, combined with a pump unit, is described in<br>
DE 19721527.<br>
Permanently excited electrical machines usually possess permanent<br>
magnets that consist of one piece per pole. In the known generator, each<br>
permanent magnet possess the shape of a cylinder mantle segment,<br>
which borders the air gap formed with the stator, in the region of the<br>
poles.<br>
Such permanent magnet shells are not easy to produce in economically<br>
efficient manner, at least not in a size that is suitable for generators with<br>
an output of more than five kVA. The installation of such one-piece<br>
permanent magnets is only possible in the non-magnetized state,<br>
because of the great magnetic forces that preclude any normal handling.<br>
Magnetization must then be performed on the completely assembled<br>
rotor, which is a complicated process. During the transport of such large<br>
permanent magnets, there is also the risk of breakage, because of their<br>
brittle material properties.<br>
In contrast, the present invention is based on the task of creating an<br>
economically efficient solution for fitting the rotor of the generator, in<br><br>
the power generator unit mentioned initially, for the purpose of magnetic<br>
excitation of the generator and, in particular, of avoiding the	<br>
aforementioned disadvantages.<br>
This task is accomplished, with regard to the production of the permanent<br>
magnets as well as with regard to their installation in the rotor of a power<br>
generator unit as stated initially.<br><br>
Because the permanent magnets are formed by a plurality of relatively<br>
small magnet elements, according to a proposal of the invention, on the<br>
one hand, it becomes possible to produce them in economically efficient<br>
manner. Such elements are not only easy to transport and easy to<br>
produce in the magnetized state, but can also be installed in simple<br>
manner. For this purpose, they are individually arranged in suitable<br>
holder pockets of the rotor, next to one another in the circumference<br>
direction, with their poles aligned the same way. These pockets are<br>
structured to be open on one or both sides, viewed in the axial direction,<br>
so that it is possible to fit the magnet elements into them from one or both<br>
faces of the rotor. Holder pockets structured to be continuous in the axial<br>
direction and open make it possible, as an advantageous embodiment,<br>
for the magnet elements to be arranged in at least two rows, in the axial<br>
direction, in the holder pockets. In this connection, there is the possibility<br>
of adapting the magnetic flow to be achieved to any desired design, by<br>
way of the magnet elements, by choosing their size and shape, number,<br>
and arrangement accordingly. For this purpose, the magnet elements<br>
can be arranged more or less close to one another; they can be arranged<br>
in one or in two or even in several rows, in the axial direction. In<br><br>
connection with their size, the radial thickness, which significantly<br>
determines the density of the magnetic flow, must be taken into particular<br>
consideration. In contrast, the length and the width of the magnet<br>
elements are non-critical for the magnetic resistance. Instead, the latter<br>
is dependent not only on the radial dimension of the magnet elements,<br>
but also even more on their number, i.e. on the arc length of the holder<br>
pockets fitted with magnet elements. In addition, the level of the exciter<br>
voltage can also be easily changed in that a small number of magnet<br>
elements with the same size and shape is moved, so that more or less<br>
large gaps between adjacent magnet elements are formed. These can<br>
be filled with replacement pieces made of plastic, if necessary, which take<br>
on the* role of filling the space.<br>
As far as the shape of the magnet elements is concerned, it can be<br>
practical to determine their length in accordance with the axial dimension<br>
of the rotor, e.g. in that the axial width of the rotor corresponds to a<br>
multiple, e.g. about twice the length of a magnet element.<br>
With regard to their cross-section structure, the magnet elements can be<br>
structured as ring segments or rectangular, for example. In the latter<br>
case, it is advantageous if the radial inside surfaces of the holder pockets<br>
are structured in polygon shape, adapted to the segments, so that the<br>
block-shaped magnet elements rest against the polygon surfaces with<br>
their large surfaces, in each instance.<br>
To improve the installation of the magnet elements, an advantageous<br>
further development consists of the fact that at least on the inside surface<br><br>
of the holder pockets that lies opposite the circumference wall, ribs are<br>
provided that run axially and define the distances between adjacent<br>
magnet elements.<br>
The magnet elements are held in place in their installation position, in<br>
each instance, as a result of the great magnetic forces. However, it can<br>
also be practical to attach the magnet elements on the inside surface of<br>
the holder pockets by gluing them in place, in addition, or to cover the<br>
holder pockets with corresponding lids made of metal or plastic at their<br>
faces that lie axially opposite.<br>
Also to simplify the installation, or for considerations of statics, it can be<br>
practical to divide the holder pockets into individual drawers that each<br>
correspond to approximately the cross-section of a magnet element, by<br>
means of partitions that run axially.<br>
The magnet elements are arranged in the rotor of the generator. In this<br>
connection, the rotor can be structured as an externa! rotor, according to<br>
the invention. Vice versa, however, the rotor with the magnet elements<br>
can also be structured as an internal rotor, where the rotor winding is then<br>
located in the stater, which is arranged on the outside.<br>
In order to prevent the edge-side magnet elements from becoming<br>
unusable as a result of magnetic reversal in the case of a so-called surge<br>
short-circuit, a deflection of the magnetic flow is provided, according to<br>
the invention, in such a way that the holder pockets are extended in the<br>
circumference direction, on both sides, going beyond the magnet<br>
element, in each instance. This prevents the permanent magnets from<br>
being demagnetized.<br><br>
With the holder pockets for the magnet elements provided according to<br>
the invention, there is the possibility of simple installation of the magnet<br>
elements, which can be positioned almost without any force, as a result of<br>
the magnetic ground. In addition, it can be practical to use a magnetic<br>
field influence during installation; for this purpose, it can be provided,<br>
according to another proposal according to the invention, that a stator is<br>
positioned inside the rotor during installation, to which current is applied<br>
during the installation, in such a way that positioning of the magnet<br>
elements can take place essentially without any force. In this way,<br>
installation difficulties resulting from strong repulsion forces between the<br>
magnet elements are avoided. With this interaction of the structure of the<br>
holder pockets, on the one hand, and fitting them with permanent<br>
magnets in the form of small magnet elements, on the other hand, an<br>
economically efficient way was found to implement such power generator<br>
units with a permanently excited synchronous generator.<br>
In the following, an exemplary embodiment of the invention will be<br>
explained on the basis of the accompanying drawing. This shows:<br>
Fig. 1 an axial cross-section through a motor/generator unit according to<br>
Section l-l of Fig. 2,<br>
Fig. 2 a view of the stator and the rotor of the motor generator unit<br>
according to Section ll-ll of Fig. 1,<br>
Fig. 3 a partially axial view of the stator, on a larger scale, corresponding<br>
to Fig. 2,<br><br>
Fig. 4 a three-dimensional portion of the rotor with permanent magnets,<br>
and<br>
Fig. 5 a view of the voltage regulator according to Section V-V of Fig. 1.<br>
The electrical machine forming a power generator as shown in Fig. 1 to 3<br>
relates to a unit composed of a drive motor and a synchronous generator.<br>
Preferably, a diesel engine is used as the drive motor, but only the<br>
connection-side end of its crankshaft 1 is shown with a broken line. On<br>
the face of the crankshaft 1, a fan wheel 2 is attached by means of<br>
screws 3. The fan wheel 2 possesses blades 4 to produce an air flow in<br>
accordance with arrow S1, for cooling the motor, where the inflowing air<br>
according to arrow S2 corresponds to the cooling air flowing out of the<br>
generator housing after generator cooling. As shown in Fig. 1, the<br>
generator housing lid 9 that is provided on the (current) outflow side<br>
possesses intake openings for the cooling air that flows in according to<br>
arrows L In order for this cooling air flow to achieve its full cooling effect<br>
in the generator housing 8, the protective hood 14 possesses one or<br>
more inlet openings for the cooling air, with an appropriate size (not<br>
shown).<br>
A connection housing 5 on the motor side encloses the space in which<br>
the fan wheel 2 is housed, radially to the outside; it is open on both sides<br>
and, on its side opposite the motor, possesses a ring flange 6 with<br>
threaded bores for screwing in attachment screws 7 for connecting the<br>
cylindrical generator housing 8, where it is practical if the latter is made of<br><br>
sheet metal, in which flange the housing is clamped in place on both<br>
faces, over a flat area. The attachment screws 7 are arranged resting<br>
against the inside of the generator housing 8, distributed over its<br>
circumference, and pass through the entire housing length. On the<br>
outflow side, the left end of the generator housing 8 in the drawing, a<br>
generator housing lid 9 is provided, which has an inside lid ring 10 with<br>
spokes that project radially inward, to which the stator 11 of the generator<br>
is attached. With their outflow-side ends, the shafts of the attachment<br>
screws 7 project through bores in the generator housing lid 9; at their free<br>
threaded ends 12, screw bolts 13 are screwed on, which serve to attach<br>
the generator housing 8 to the generator housing lid 9 as well as to attach<br>
the protective hood 14 by means of short screws 15; these are screwed in<br>
from the outside, through corresponding bores in the protective hood 14,<br>
into threaded bores of the facing ends of the screw bolts 13. The<br>
protective hood 14 covers the related free end of the generator housing<br>
lid 9 from the outside, with its edge segment 16 that forms the open end.<br>
While eight attachment screws 7 are provided according to the present<br>
embodiment, distributed over the circumference, six stator screws 17 are<br>
sufficient to attach the stator to the inside lid ring 10, which screws are<br>
passed through bores of the sheet-metal package of an outside stator<br>
part 19 and are screwed into the lid ring 10 via spacer sleeves 20<br>
between the inside lid ring 10 and the facing side of the outside stator part<br>
19. In this way, the outside stator part 19 is fixed firmly in place on the<br>
housing, where the sheet-metal package that forms the outside stator part<br>
19 is secured together by the stator screws 17.<br><br>
The sheet-metal package that forms an inside stator part 21 is arranged<br>
on a hollow shaft 24, so as to rotate with it. The hollow shaft 24 is<br>
connected with a torsion rod 46 that is arranged in the shaft axis with pre-<br>
stress, via its end cap 60. It is mounted to rotate on bearing bushings 47<br>
in bearing flanges 26 of sheathing plates 22, which are arranged on<br>
opposite faces of the sheet-metal package. The end of the torsion rod 46<br>
that lies opposite the end cap 60 is fixed in place on the housing via a<br>
rigid rod support 44. Its attachment eye 61 is seated on a screw 62,<br>
which secures the sheet-metal package of the iron yoke 42 together. The<br>
sheathing plates 22 cover a control air gap ^between the inside stator<br>
part 21 and the outside stator part 19. Since the sheet-metal package<br>
that forms the inside stator part 21 is therefore seated on the hollow shaft<br>
24 so as to rotate with it, it also performs its rotation for the purpose of the<br>
desired constant regulation of the generator voltage. Adjustment of the<br>
inside stator part 21 relative to the outside stator part 19 for the purpose<br>
of regulating the generator voltage will be described in further detail<br>
below.<br>
The view according to Fig. 2 shows not only the contour of the sheet-<br>
metal package that forms the rotor 29, but also the contour of the sheet-<br>
metal packages that form the stator, which packages have cut-outs 38 to<br>
hold the winding wires of the rotary current winding 28 of the generator, in<br>
the region of the outside stator part 19; it does not show the insulation<br>
plate 25 shown in Fig. 1, which was left out in order to improve the view.<br>
The outside stator part 19 is attached to the inside lid ring 10 shown in<br>
Fig. 1, by means of stator screws 17 passed through bores 39 in its<br>
sheet-metal package. In accordance with the selected section line, one<br><br>
can also see the spacer sleeves 20, which support the sheet-metal<br>
package of the outside stator part 19 against the inside lid ring 10.<br>
Three holding screws 27 serve to center the inside stator part 21 within<br>
the outside stator part 19, by means of lateral sheathing plates 22, in the<br>
bearing flanges 26 of which the hollow shaft 24 is mounted with the<br>
sheet-metal package of the inside stator part 21.<br>
The sheathing plates 22 are also covered by an insulation plate 25, in<br>
each instance, towards the outside, in the region of the control air gap 23,<br>
which serves to provide electrical insulation of the rotary current winding<br>
28 of the generator, as well as of three holding screws 27 arranged<br>
distributed over the circumference, from the sheathing plate 22. The<br>
holding screws 27 run through bores in the sheet-metal package that<br>
forms the outside stator part 19. They are insulated from the sheet-metal<br>
package by means of insulation sleeves, and center the inside stator part<br>
21 relative to the outside stator part 19 via the sheathing plates 22.<br>
The stator 11 is surrounded by the rotor 29, which is also composed of a<br>
sheet-metal package, which is secured by means of clamping screws 30,<br>
which are screwed into corresponding threaded bores of the fan wheel 2<br>
with a motor-side threaded end 31. Support sleeves 32 pushed onto the<br>
clamping screws 30 are secured between the fan wheel and the related<br>
side of the rotor 29. In this way, the rotor 29 is connected with the fan<br>
wheel 2 so as to rotate with it. On its inside circumference, it forms a<br>
narrow air gap 33, with a width of approximately 2 mm, relative to the<br>
stator 11. In addition, the rotor 29 has approximately cylindrical pockets<br><br>
according to Fig. 4, a cavity 48 is provided at the end of the cut-out in<br>
which the magnet elements 35 are seated. Without this cavity 48, the<br>
extraordinarily great flow density in this region would result in magnetic<br>
reversal in the case of a surge short-circuit of the generator, and therefore<br>
in destruction of the outside magnet element 35. By structuring the cavity<br>
48 with a defined magnetic ground 49, this magnetic reversal can be<br>
prevented. The cavity 48 is formed by an extension of the inside<br>
circumference wall 50 of the pockets 34 and a bridge 51 adjacent to the<br>
pole gap 52, through which the magnetic ground 49 runs. Ribs 53 that<br>
run axially on the insides of the pockets 34 define the distances between<br>
the magnet elements 35.<br>
Fig. 3 shows an enlarged portion of Fig. 2, to make the illustration more<br>
clear, where parts that agree with one another are designated with the<br>
same reference symbol. Insulation plate 25 and sheathing plate 22,<br>
which serves to position the inside stator part 21, are indicated with<br>
reference lines at the outside and inside contour in Fig. 3, in each<br>
instance. The bearing bushing 47 is shown from the face side. In a<br>
portion 38 of the outside stator part 19, winding wires of the rotary current<br>
winding 28 are shown in cross-section.<br>
The changeable control air gap 23 between the outside stator part 19 and<br>
the inside stator part 21 is essentia! for the principle of functioning of the<br>
voltage regulation of the generator. The circumference surfaces of the<br>
inside stator part 21 that are adjacent to the control air gap 23, on the one<br>
hand, and those of the outside stator part 19, on the other hand, are<br>
structured with three segments over the circumference, where the three<br>
individual segments have projecting circumference segments that run<br><br>
34 that go through in the axial direction, and run within two pole<br>
segments, into which magnet elements 35 in the form of narrow ingot-<br>
shaped rods are inserted from both sides, specifically, in the present<br>
example, as is evident from Fig. 2, two rows often magnet elements 35,<br>
in each instance, arranged next to one another, which are responsible for<br>
the magnetic excitation of the generator. In the region of the pockets 34,<br>
the inner contour line 36 of the circumference wall 50 of the rotor 29,<br>
which delimits the pockets 34 radially towards the inside, forms the<br>
narrow air gap 33, together with the outer contour line 37 of the stator 11.<br>
Bores 40 in the rotor plates serve for installation of a starter (not shown).<br>
In accordance with Fig. 2 and 4, the magnet elements 35 are pushed into<br>
the pockets 34 axially, so that they form the two poles lying next to one<br>
another, distributed in polygon shape. The subdivision of the permanent<br>
magnets for the poles into small magnet elements 35 allows them to be<br>
produced in economically efficient manner; their installation is greatly<br>
facilitated by means of a suitable magnetic ground 49, because in this<br>
way the mutual repulsion of adjacent magnet elements 35 is practically<br>
eliminated. The individual magnet elements 35 can be pushed into the<br>
pockets 34 practically without any force. In this connection, no special<br>
attachment of the magnet elements 35 is required, since they are held in<br>
the axial direction by their magnetic forces during operation, and are<br>
supported in the pockets, viewed in the radial direction, so that they can<br>
easily withstand the centrifugal forces that occur during operation.<br>
In the three-dimensional representation of the magnet arrangement<br><br>
approximately in screw shape, deviating from the circular shape. For<br>
example, the control air gap 23 becomes narrower, if one turns the inside<br>
stator part 21 relative to the outside stator part 19, in the clockwise<br>
direction, in accordance with the arrow U (Fig. 2), starting from the<br>
position shown with broken lines, where the end position is reached<br>
approximately at a path of rotation in accordance with the angle w. In this<br>
end position, the control air gap 23 is the smallest it can be.<br>
By turning the inside rotor part 21 relative to the outside rotor part 19, the<br>
geometry of the control air gap 23 and therefore the magnetic resistance<br>
in the stator 11 are changed. This circumstance is utilized in the present<br>
permanently excited synchronous machine to regulate the voltage. By<br>
changing the magnetic flew as described, it is possible to regulate the<br>
induced voltage, where there is a direct proportionality between the latter<br>
and the magnetic flow. Because of the fact that the inside stator part 21<br>
is seated on a hollow shaft 24 with a pre-stressed torsion rod 46, torsion<br>
forces that counteract the force effects of the magnetic field on the inside<br>
stator part 21 are mobilized, so that the rotation of the inside stator part<br>
21 relative to the outside stator part 19 that is applied for the purpose of<br>
voltage regulation can take place almost without force, using a rotary<br>
magnet 41. However, this presumes that the torsion pre-stress is<br>
adapted to the magnetic resetting force.<br>
The rotary magnet 41 shown in Fig. 1 and 5 is arranged on the inside of<br>
an iron yoke 42, which carries a winding 43 controlled by the generator<br>
terminal voltage. In this connection, voltage variations at the generator<br>
winding result in a rotation of the rotary magnet 41, and thereby cause the<br>
desired constant regulation of the voltage by means of a relative rotation<br>
between the two stator parts. In accordance with Fig. 1, the rotary<br>
magnet 41 is over-mounted on the related end of the hollow shaft 24,<br>
which in turn is connected to rotate with the inside stator part 21. The<br>
rotary magnet 41 is seated centered on a bearing segment 45 at the end<br>
of the hollow shaft 24, and is pressed against a shoulder of the hollow<br><br>
shaft 24 there. Preferably, the rotary magnet 41 with the related yoke 42<br>
are each formed from sheet metal.<br>
In accordance with Fig. 5, the electrical circuit for activation of the rotary<br>
magnet 41 is also drawn in. The winding 43, which is affixed at one of the<br>
poles of the iron yoke 42, is applied to the terminal voltage U1, U2 of the<br>
f generator winding 28. In this connection, the magnetic flow is directly<br>
proportional to the induced voltage and controls the rotation of the rotary<br>
magnet 41 and also of the inside stator part 21, via the hollow shaft 24,<br>
causing the geometry of the control air gap 23 and therefore the magnetic<br>
resistance in the stator 11 to be changed. The result is simple regulation<br>
of the terminal voltage of the generator, independent of the power factor<br>
