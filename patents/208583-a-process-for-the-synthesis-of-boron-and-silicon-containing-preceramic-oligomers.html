This  invention relates to a process for the  synthesis of boron and silicon containing preceramic oligomers.<br>
Ceramic  materials  are  widely used  in   aerospace environments particularly in fabricating heat engines, high speed cutting tools and  electronic sensors operable under extreme environmental  conditions.   Advanced  ceramic materials  which provide  oxidation resistant coatings are preferred in  aerospace industry.    However,   inherent    brittleness   and   difficult processing  conditions of many ceramics limit the scope of  their application  in this field.  Organometallic polymers  that  yield ceramics on pyrolysis are now considered as a viable  alternative to  conventional  ceramics.   These polymers may be drawn  into fibres, moulded to form any desired shape, dissolved in  solvents and  applied as coatings on substrates of choice and may then  be subjected  to  pyrolysis  to  obtain  corresponding  ceramic  end products.   These  polymers find use as binders  to  conventional ceramic  powders which are difficult to sinter  and  as  matrix resins  for  making ceramic matrix composites and  for  obtaining ultrafine  ceramic  powders.   Idealy, the polymer  chosen  as  a ceramic precursor must be meltable or soluble in organic solvents and must yield a high ceramic residue on  pyrolysis.<br>
Over the last two decades, many preceramic polymers have been developed from SiC, B4C Si3N4, Si-C-N, and BN. Ceramic fibres, coatings, components and matrix composites are made using these polymers.  Considerable interest is now shown in<br><br>
muIticomponent ceramics as they possess improved thermomechanical properties when  compared to single component  ceramic  systems. However,  multicomponent  ceramic  materials  are  difficult   to synthesise by the conventional high temperature synthesis such as solid  state  reaction due to the  thermodynamic  instability  of their  solid  solutions.   On  the  other  hand,   multicomponent ceramics  can  be synthesised in the form  of  matastable  single phase   solid   solutions  through  the  polymer  to  ceramic transformation    route.      Boron   and   silicon    containing multicomponent  ceramics are reported to have high thermal  shock resistance,   oxidation  resistance  and   high   crystallization temperature.   Synthesis of preceramic polymers containing  boron and silicon are known in the art.  Major impediments involved  in the  existing  synthetic  processes  of  preceramic  oligomers containing boron and silicon are the high cost of components  and low  ceramic residue.  Preceramic polymers yielding high  ceramic residues are preferred as the volatiles evolved during  pyrolysis are  lower  when  compared  to  polymers  yielding  low   ceramic residues.   Reduction in the yield of volatiles during pyrolysis reduces  the porosity of the final ceramic product.   Considering this* it is clear that a high ceramic yielding polymer having low volatile  content  is preferred  over  a  low ceramic  yielding prepolymer.  Conventional processes for synthesising silicon  and boron preceramic polymers involve high reaction temperatures.<br>
The  objective  of  this invention  is  to   develop  a process  for synthesising boron and silicon  preceramic  polymers<br><br>
avoiding the above discussed drawbacks. Boric acid which is a cheap source of boron when compared with other sources boron is used as one of the starting materials. It is surprisingly found that use of boric acid as a starting material has definite advantages over other aspects also. Preceramic oligomers preparedd from boric acid yields very high ceramic residues. Reaction temperature is also considerably lower when compared with the other known synthetic processes where a temperature of 1200Â° or more is often required.<br>
Boric   acid   is  polycondensed  with   substituted alkoxysilanes  in  a high boiling organic  solvents  to produce preceramic  oligomer.   The molar ratio of boric  acid  to  the alkoxysilane monomer may vary from 3:1 to 1:3.  Solvents used may be selected from diglyme, dioxane, n-butyl ether or a mixture  of two or more of these solvents.  The proportion of the solvents in the mixture is not particularly relevant.  The preferred  solvent is diglyme.  The solvent to monomer ratio may vary from 0.5  to 2.0 by weight.  Alkoxysilane may be substituted mono, di or  tri substituted  alkyl,  alkenyl,  aryl,  styrylalkyl,   cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl&gt; cyclopentadienyl, acryloxyalkyl or methacryloxyalkyl. Alkoxysilane may have more than one of the  above  substituents. Alkoxy groups may be methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy or butoxy.   Alkyl groups may be methyl, ethyl, propyl, or isopropyl.  Aryl groups may be phenyl or tolyl group and the alkenyl groups may be vinyl, allyl and butenyl groups.  Alkoxysilanes may be substituted with<br><br>
cyclopenty1,   cyclohexyl,   cyclohexenyl,   cyclohenyl    ethyl, cyolopentadienyl  propyl  trialkoxysilnes.   Some  examples  of substituted  alkoxysilanes are  acryloxyalkyl,  methacryloxyalkyl trialkoxysilane,  di(acryloxyalkyl)  or di  (methacryloxy  alkyl) dialkoxysilane,     di(methacryloxylalkyl)      dialkoxysilane, di(methacryloxyl   alkyl) dialkoxysilane,  tri(acryloxyalkyl)  or tri(methacryloxyalkyl) alkoxysilane.  The styrylalkyl substituted alkoxysilanes  are  styrylethyltriaIkyIsilane,   di(styrylethyl) dialkoxysilane or tri (styrylethylalkoxysilane.  A mixture of two or more of these substituted monomers may be used in any desired porportion.  Polycondensation takes place at a temperature  range of   100   to   160Â°C,   An   inorganic    acid   selected   from hydrochloricacid, sulphuric acid, nitric acid or phosphoric  acid is  used as a catalyst.  The preferred catalyst may be  added  in the  range of 0.1 to 2% by wt of the monomers.  The  reaction  is carried out for a period of 3-5 hours.  Alkyl alcohol produced as a  by-product during the polycondensation reaction  is  distilled off during the reaction.  The oligomer produced may be  separated from  the organic solvent medium by distillation of  the  solvent and may be stored in an inert atmosphere.<br>
The process for the synthesis of boron and silicon containing preceramic oligomers according to this invention comprises copolycondensation of boric acid with at least one substituted alkoxysilane monomer in the presence of an inorganic acid catalyst under known polymerisation conditions and isolating the resultant ologomer from the reaction mixture by known means.<br><br>
The oligomer may be converted into ceramics by heating in an inert atmosphere to a temperature of 900Â° or above. Ceramic components may be prepared from these oligomers by dissolving in a suitable organic solvents and admixing with a nonoxide ceramic powder. Nonoxide ceramic powder may be selected from SiC, Si3N4 , B4C TiC or TiN or mixtures thereof. On removal of the solvent by drying under vacuum at 80 - 100Â°C for about 30 hours, on oligomers-non-xide-ceramic blend is obtainedd which may be cast into a green body of any desired shape. This green body may be converted into a ceramic components by heating in a tubular furnace at a heating rate of 2.5%Â°C/min to 1400Â°C.<br>
The  following  non-limitive  examples   illustrates illustrates the process of synthesising the preceramic oligomers.<br>
Example 1:<br>
A mixture of 57.14g (o.30 mol) of vinyltriethoxysilane, 9.27g (0.15mol) boric acid, 50 ml of diglyme and 1 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid is taken in a three necked round bottom flask equipped with mechanical stirrer and an inlet and an outlet for nitrogen. The contents of the flask are heated under a flow of nitrogen in an oil bath at a temperature of about 150Â°C under stirring for a period of three hours. The reaction mixture is then allowed to cool and ethanol formed as a by-product is distilled off solvent digylm is distilled thereafter under reduced pressure to obtain a colourless residue which  is dried<br><br>
under vaccum at 60Â°C for about 10 hours. The oligomer is obtained in 75 to 85% of the theoretical yield and is stored in a dessioator in nitrogen atmosphere.<br><br>
Example 2<br>
A mixture containing 57.7g of phenyltrimethoxysilane, 9.27g of boric acid, 50 ml of diglyme and 1 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acidd is heated and the steps detailed in Example I is carried out. The resultant polymer is found to be stable upto 400Â°C in an atmosphere of nitrogen. This preceramic polymer yields about 67 to 70% of ceramic residue when heated to 900Â°C or above.<br>
