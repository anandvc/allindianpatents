				<td>METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR MANUFACTURING A JACK OR HYDRAULIC,<br>
PNEUMATIC OR OLEPKEUMATIC CYLINDER.<br>
The present invention substantially relates to the method and<br>
an apparatus for manufacturing a jack or hydraulic, pneumatic or<br>
oleopneumatic cylinders. More specifically, the invention relates<br>
to a method for "closing" cylinder? by means of mechanical<br>
"rolling".<br>
Currently, the manufacturing of jacks and hydraulic, pneumatic<br>
or oleopneumatic cylinders provides welding the: bottom and the head<br>
to the tubular body of the cylinder itself, with evident labor and<br>
processing costs, as well as problems of inner tensions of the<br>
materials caused by the high temperatures locally reached during<br>
the welding procedures.<br>
Other processes used for closing cylinders., such as for<br>
example coining and lamination, have shown serious drawbacks due<br>
both to the presence of not-in-tolerance crackings in the plastic<br>
deformation area which cause a production wast.e of about 20%, and<br>
to the dishomogeneity of the plastic deformation with consequent<br>
failure in locking and mechanical sealing involving a production<br>
waste of about 70%.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to improve the<br>
implementing procedures, more precisely the step of closing<br>
hydraulic, pneumatic and oleopneumatic cylinders. This has been<br>
achieved, according to the invention, by providing a process which<br>
provides the elimination of welding and threading procedures, by<br>
replacing them with a particular processing of plastic deformation<br>
implemented by means of mechanical rolling.<br><br>
Means for implementing the above mentioned method are also<br>
object of the present invention.<br>
The inventive concept underlying the invention is to perform<br>
the "closing" of a cylinder or jack without threading and/or<br>
welding procedures in order to join the head and the bottom to the<br>
tubular body of the jack itself.<br>
These procedures are easily and cheaply implemented by means<br>
of a particular locking/closing method which performs a "plastic"<br>
deformation controlled by a rolling process implemented by a<br>
specific apparatus.<br>
According to the invention, in order to eliminate said<br>
drawbacks a mechanical rolling is provided implemented by a roiling<br>
machine equipped with a special, preferably multiroller, shaping<br>
head allowing to drastically reduce processing waste.<br>
A better understanding of the invention will take place with<br>
the following description and by referring to the accompanying<br>
drawings which illustrate a preferred embodiment, by way of<br>
example.<br>
In the accompanying drawings :<br>
figure 1 schematically shows an exploded view of the<br>
components of a jack according to the invention;<br>
figure 2 schematically shows the jack of fig. 1 already<br>
assembled and cLosed, ready to be used;<br>
figure 3 is a perspective view illustrating the multiroller<br>
head during the processing implementing the plastic deformation;<br><br>
figure 4 shows a second way for obtaining the<br>
plastic deformation according to the invention;<br>
figure 5 is a tridimensional section showing an<br>
exploded view of the end part of the jack head after<br>
the deformation; and<br>
figure 6 is a low-enlarged photographic image of<br>
the section.<br>
The present invention allows eliminating, in the<br>
procedures for manufacturing jacks and hydraulic,<br>
pneumatic and oleopneumatic cylinders, the threading<br>
and welding mechanical procedures by replacing them<br>
with a particular rolling procedure.<br>
As it is know, a jack (figures 1 and 2) is<br>
constituted by a bottom 1, a liner or tube 4, a piston<br>
2, a rod 3 and a head 5.<br>
The bottom 1 and the head 5 must, be fastened in an<br>
irremovable way to the liner 4: the first one; operating<br>
as closing member of the cylinder or the jack itself,<br>
the second one as member allowing the sliding of the<br>
rod 3 pushed by the used liquid or gas. The rod 3, in<br>
turn, is obviously integral with the piston 2.<br>
The latter, which is free to slide inside the<br>
liner or tube 4, is hydraulically or pneumatically<br>
sealed with one or more preferably ring-like (O-ring)<br>
gaskets G inserted in specific grooves 6 arranged on<br>
the piston 2 itself.<br>
The same system of gaskets G and grooves 6 is<br>
utilized to guarantee the seal between the rod 3 and<br>
the head 5, as well as for the seal between bottom 1<br>
and liner 4 and between head 5 and liner 4.<br>
As it was already mentioned, in order to<br><br>
manufacture a jack several different methods are<br>
currently used utilizing two different techniques to<br>
join the head to the tube and the bottom to the tube:<br>
threading and welding. In practice, both techniques can<br>
be used both to fasten the bottom to the tube and the<br>
head to the tube, or more frequently the welding for<br>
anchoring the bottom to the tube and the threading for<br>
anchoring the head to the tube.<br>
The welding procedure, in particular, apart from<br>
the time required for the implementation thereof,<br>
causes a stress to the tube 4 and deforms it, by<br>
reducing the average life time of the cylinder or the<br>
jack itself.<br>
The rolling procedure according to the invention<br>
is performed by means of the above-mentioned mechanical<br>
rolling machine equipped with a special shaping<br>
multiroller head which, by properly acting on the tube,<br>
implements in an uniform, reproducible way and without<br>
crackings, a predetermined plastic deformation allowing<br>
the perfect mechanical seal in the coupling between<br>
tube 4 and bottom 1 and between tube 4 and head 5. To<br>
this purpose, the bottom and the head are equipped with<br>
at least a respective outer annular groove 7 wherein<br>
the deformed area of the tube 4 fits.<br>
As shown by figure 2, the innermost groove 6 of<br>
the bottom 1 and that of the head 5 act as seat for the<br>
gasket G of appropriate material which guarantees the<br>
hydraulic or pneumatic seal, whereas the respective<br>
outer grooves 7 are apt to receive the material of the<br>
tube 4 which is "shifted" by plastic deformation with<br>
the mechanical rolling processing which is described.<br><br>
Said plastic deformation of the tube or liner 4,<br>
in fact, forms an outer annular groove and a<br>
corresponding inner ring projecting in radial direction<br>
towards the axis of the tube itself, which ring,<br>
indeed, is apt to insert into a corresponding annular<br>
groove 7 arranged both on the bottom 1 and on the head<br>
5.<br>
Advantageously, the utilized mechanical processing<br>
guarantees a uniform contact, inside the grooves 7,<br>
between the tube 4 and the components (bottom 1 and<br>
head 5) fastened at the ends thereof.<br>
The processing quality has been checked by means<br>
of scan electron microscopy analysis on several tube<br>
samples. SEM observations have involved the outer<br>
surface, the inner surface and the manufact section<br>
which has been prepared for the observation with<br>
metallographic techniques. The survey has demonstrated<br>
that there are crackings only on the outer surface in<br>
very small quantities and they are limited to a depth<br>
lower than 10-20m; the inner surfaces do not have<br>
crackings. In figure 6 a low-enlarged image of a<br>
section of the junction area between tube and bottom or<br>
head is shown, made according to the Longitudinal axis<br>
of the tube itself.<br>
The mechanical rolling procedures are performed by<br>
anchoring the preassembled cylinder to the special<br>
shaping multiroller head TM implementing the closing<br>
procedure. The procedure can take place in cold and/or<br>
hot status, with variable pressures in a very wide<br>
range and with likewise very variable revolution speeds<br>
of the shaping rollers R1: said several parameters,<br><br>
upon setting up the production, have to be fastened according to<br>
sizes and thicknesses of the tube 4, features of the constituting<br>
material, etc.<br>
The time for performing each rolling procedure var ies from few<br>
seconds to a maximum of 50-60 seconds.<br>
With respect to the solutions adopted up to now, the process<br>
which is described advantageously allows to securely anchor the<br>
bottom 1 and the head 5 to the tube 4 by reducing the production<br>
waste from values higher than 70% to values lower than 0,1".<br>
It is also to be pointed out that, the experimental data<br>
on a prototype production of 2000 pieces have demonstrated an<br>
absolute reproducibility of the rolling processing with respect to<br>
the structural homogeneity of the involved tube area, to the<br>
dimensional reproducibility of the generated plastic deformation,<br>
to the complete and homogeneous "filling-up" of the locking seat 7<br>
(fig.6). These conditions guarantee an optimum mechanical and<br>
hydraulic seal.<br>
With the tests performed on the manufactured prototypes it has<br>
been found out that both :he mechanical and hydraulic seal are<br>
better than the current products available on the market.<br>
Furthermore, the average Life of the product obtained<br>
according to the invention is longer than that of the currently<br>
known cylinders and jacks, since with the process so far described<br>
the liner 4 is not subjected to deformations on allowances with the<br>
other components since no welding procedure has been performed.<br>
From the operating point of view, the "rolling" process<br>
so far described is performed as follows : a<br><br>
special shaping multiroller head TM of a rolling<br>
machine is positioned at the area of the tube or liner<br>
4 wherein the plastic deformation must occur which<br>
generates the outer annular groove 7 thereto an inner<br>
annular jut of the liner itself corresponds, which<br>
radially projects towards the axis of the tube 4.<br>
Once in position, the shaping rollers R1 are<br>
approached in an uniform and gradual way to the tube 4,<br>
along a radial direction.<br>
During the approaching step to the tube 4, the<br>
rollers Rl symmetrically move in radial direction with<br>
respect to the cylinder and also have the same<br>
simultaneous rotating motion. In this way, once in<br>
contact with the tube 4 which is free to rotate about<br>
its own axis integrally with the bottom 1 and/or the<br>
head 5 positioned inside thereof, the: rolling machine<br>
causes to the same, by means of an adequate pressure of<br>
the shaping rollers Rl, a localized and predetermined<br>
annular plastic deformation (in cold or hot status).<br>
The rotating motion of the rollers Rl and, by the<br>
dragging effect, of the tube 4 (in opposite direction<br>
with respect to the rollers) makes such processing<br>
easier, by making optimum and constant the material<br>
shifting towards the inside of the corresponding groove<br>
7 of the bottom 1 and/or of the head 5 by performing<br>
the locking thereof. Figure 5 shows an exploded view<br>
wherein the deformation subjected by the tube 4 at the<br>
head 5 is clearly seen.<br>
Such procedure avoids the cracking formation both<br>
outside and inside the tube 4 and allows an integral<br>
lock between tube and end components, without radial<br><br>
and/or axial slacks.<br>
From what said, it is clear that the process which<br>
is described substantially comprises the steps of:<br>
1.	Placing the gaskets G inside the corresponding<br>
annular grooves 6 arranged on the bottom 1;<br>
2.	Inserting the bottom 1 in the predetermined position<br>
thereof at one end of the liner 4 of the jack;<br>
3.	Positioning the multiroller head TM at the above-<br>
mentioned first end of the tube 4;<br>
4.	Contemporaneously approaching the shaping rollers R1<br>
to the outer cylindrical surface of the tube 4 and<br>
performing the plastic deformation by means of<br>
rolling;<br>
5.	Taking the shaping rollers Rl away from the<br>
cylinder;<br>
6.	Placing the gaskets G inside the corresponding<br>
annular grooves 6 arranged on the piston 2 integral<br>
with the rod 3;<br>
7.	Placing the gaskets G inside the corresponding<br>
annular grooves 6 arranged on the outer and inner<br>
cylindrical surface of the head 5;<br>
8.	Inserting the piston 2 inside the tube 4 as well as<br>
the head 5, already inserted onto the rod 3, in its<br>
predetermined position at a second end of the liner<br>
4 of the jack;<br>
9.	Repeating the steps 3 to 6 with respect to the<br>
above-mentioned second end.<br>
Obviously, it is also possible to exchange the<br>
sequence of steps to fasten first the head 5 and then<br>
the bottom 1.<br>
Furthermore, it has just to be noted that it is<br><br>
also possible to provide two multiroller heads TM which<br>
contemporarily act on the two ends of the cylinders 4,<br>
after having placed the parts to be fastened and the<br>
piston 2 with the rod 3 into the corresponding correct<br>
positions, already equipped with gaskets G.<br>
In the embodiment example just illustrated (fig.<br>
3) , the multiroller head TM prefex-ably provides three<br>
shaping rollers R1 placed at 12 0° to make the apparatus<br>
self-centering, which guarantee an absolutely uniform<br>
and symmetrical distribution of loads and stresses, by<br>
reducing to the minimum the deformations and inner<br>
tensions which could create asymmetry and/or cracks.<br>
Anyway, it is clear that a number of rollers lower<br>
or higher than three can also be used.<br>
At last, a variant of the present invention shown<br>
in figure 4, provides replacing the multiroller head TM<br>
by a shaping-ring matrix Ml.<br>
With respect to the preceding solution, the<br>
plastic deformation is performed by a shaping ring<br>
constituted by two half-rings (matrixes) Ml, shaped on<br>
the inside, which gradually approach, by rotating at<br>
predetermined speed, to the tube 4 of the cylinder, by<br>
implementing the wished plastic deformation.<br>
An additional variant of the head which, performs<br>
the plastic deformation according to the invention, as<br>
alternative to the shaping rollers (Rl), provides a<br>
single shaping roller (Rl) and one or more thrust<br>
rollers to counterbalance the stresses generated by the<br>
plastic deformation.<br>
The present invention has been described by<br>
referring to an embodiment and some variants thereof,<br><br>
but it is clear that any person skilled in the art could apply<br>
modifications and/or replacements equivalent from the technical<br>
and/or operating point of view, however comprised within the<br>
protective scope of the present industrial invention.<br><br>
