Glucosamine (NAG) is a generic and can be used for other ligands such as sialic acid,<br>
galactose and mannose.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Carbohydrates exhibit molecular diversity and wide structural variations, which<br>
makes carbohydrates alternative ligands for competitive binding to inhibit the<br>
infections. Sharon et al., (Science, 246:227-234,1989) reported carbohydrate portions<br>
of glyco-conjugate molecules to be an important entity in biology. One of the major<br>
advantage of carbohydrate modification may be that it can impart change in physical<br>
characteristics such as solubility, stability, activity, antibody recognition and<br>
susceptibility to enzyme.<br>
Carbohydrates can be incorporated in polymer chain and can be utilized for binding to<br>
the receptors. Thereby, the polymers can be coupled with the other polymers<br>
containing ligands to impart multivalent effect.<br>
Carbohydrates play a crucial role in biological phenomena and therefore such<br>
molecules have attracted the attention of chemists and biochemists. These<br>
biomolecules are ubiquitous, figuring prominently in various processes such as cell<br>
differentiation, cell growth, inflammation, viral and bacterial infection, tumorigenesis<br>
and metastasis (Rouhi A.,M., C &amp; EN, Sept 23,62-66,1996).<br>
Infections caused by bacteria and virus are a result of host receptor interactions. The<br>
foremost step for the infection is the adhesion of the ligands present on the infectious<br>
microbe to the receptors of the host cells. Adhesion and interactions have to be strong<br>
for a successful infection. If the adhesion is not adequate then normal defense<br>
mechanism can intercept this process. Viruses and bacteria for example interact with<br>
certain saccharides of the host cell. Bacteria express a large number of lectins and are<br>
used to adhere to glycocalyx of the host cell through a multivalent interactions.<br>
Agglutination of erythrocytes is a case in point.<br>
Many alterations and modifications of the naturally occurring O / N-glycosidic<br>
sugars are being reported and is an area of prime interest to the chemist and<br>
biochemist.<br>
Carbohydrates are usually linked to other moieties such as lipids or proteins.<br>
Belvilacqua et al., (Science, 243:1160,1989) have demonstrated the role of<br>
carbohydrates along with proteins and nucleic acids as a primary biological<br>
information carriers.<br>
Recently few reports have been published to justify the use of carbohydrates in<br>
therapeutics for human, as they can play crucial role in prevention of viral and<br>
bacterial infections. Krepinsky et al. (United States Patent 6,184,368, 2001) suggested<br>
the application of carbohydrates in preventing the infections. Mandeville, et al.<br>
(United States Patent, 5,891,862,1999) reported the use of polyvalent polymers<br>
containing carbohydrates for the treatment of rotavirus infection<br>
Polyvalent molecules bind to the receptor molecules through multiple contacts, which<br>
results in strong binding. However, the synthesis of ligands is critical and involves<br>
multiple steps. The polyvalent interactions can be maximized by incorporation of<br>
ligands optimally tailored based on the understanding of the binding between the<br>
ligand and the host receptor. The enhanced interactions are important especially when<br>
the ligands are expensive e.g. sialic acid.<br>
The inventors of the present invention have also observed that interactions can be<br>
enhanced by 1) appropriate incorporation of the ligand 2) incorporation of spacer<br>
chain and 3) steric stabilization / exclusion using polymers.<br>
Spaltenstein et al., (J.Am.Chem. Soc., 113:686,1991) reported increased interaction<br>
between the receptor and ligand due to plurality of binding ligands and the receptors<br>
on the host surface. This was illustrated by the influenza virus hemagglutinin, which<br>
binds to neuraminic acid on the cell surface, which has a greater affinity for its<br>
receptor when a polyvalent structure is presented.<br>
Protein carbohydrate interactions are of low affinity. If relative density and spatial<br>
arrangement of ligands incorporated is optimized, then the binding can be<br>
substantially enhanced. The enhanced interaction between molecular conjugate with a<br>
specific binding site of biomolecule also finds applications in affinity separations,<br>
drug delivery and biotechnology.<br>
Design of high affinity protein carbohydrate binding systems can provide an<br>
alternative strategy for the treatment of infectious diseases e.g. influenza and<br>
rotavirus. This has the advantage as such agents will not have pathogen resistance to<br>
antibiotics and drugs. A new approach to treat influenza is based on the principle of<br>
inhibition of virus to the host cells. The inhibitors like sialic acid anchored to<br>
polymeric or liposomal carriers have been reported in the past.<br>
Since monovalent interactions of natural oligosaccharides are weak, they need to be<br>
used in large quantities for an effective treatment. This problem can be overcome by<br>
synthesizing polyvalent carbohydrate molecules (Zopf, D., Roth, S. Lancet 347, 1017,<br>
1996). The concept is attractive since it would provide a non-toxic therapeutic to a<br>
wide range of human diseases. But synthesis of such compounds is critical and<br>
requires knowledge of the host-cell binding mechanism.<br>
Polymeric ligands that bind to the virus more powerfully than the Red Blood Cells<br>
will prevent the influenza infection. Similar binding is also involved in rotavirus<br>
infections. (Mandeville, et al. United States Patent 6,187,762, 2001)<br>
Advantage of carbohydrate modification lies in that it may impart change in physical<br>
characteristics such as solubility, stability, activity, antibody recognition and<br>
susceptibility to enzyme.<br>
Sigal, et al., demonstrated (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 118:16, 3789-3800,1996)<br>
haemagglutination prevention by saccharides multivalent glycoconjugates, which bind<br>
to the bacterial lectins and thus inhibit bacterial adhesion. Damschroder et al. (United<br>
States Patent 2,548,520,1951) demonstrated high molecular weight preformed<br>
polymers conjugated with unsaturated monomers or proteins. Synthesis of high<br>
molecular weight materials of this kind generally requires temperatures up to 100 ° C.<br>
Such high temperatures are not well tolerated by most of the proteins as they are<br>
thermolabile. Thus the methods described are unsuitable for producing polymers of<br>
biologically active molecules.<br>
Carbohydrates can be used as functionalized ligands by incorporation into polymer<br>
backbone. The copolymers containing NAG and macromer containing polyvalent<br>
NAG form a multivalent conjugate.<br>
Multivalent copolymers of varied length and density will be useful for receptor ligand<br>
interactions of biological origin. Various chemical and chemoenzymetic methods<br>
have been reported in the past for the preparation of di- and trivalent ligands,<br>
dendrimers, and high molecular weight polymers but have proven to be complicated<br>
to synthesize.Thus, there is necessity of a simple methodology to obtain multivalent<br>
ligands and polymers of varying chain length. Mammen,M., and Whitesides,G.,M.,<br>
demonstrated that (J.Med.Chem.38:21,4179-90,1995) agglutination of erythrocytes<br>
caused by influenza virus could be prevented by use of polyvalent sialic acid<br>
inhibitor. Moreover, they suggested two favorable mechanisms for inhibition between<br>
the surfaces of virus and erythrocytes 1) high-affinity binding through polyvalency<br>
and 2) steric stabilization. This novel approach is a model for pathogen-host<br>
interactions.<br>
Sigel, et al.(J.Am.Chem.Soc. 118:16,3789-3800,1996) prepared polymers containing<br>
sialoside and evaluated the efficiency of inhibition of influenza virus in terms of<br>
inhibition constants (Kj).Although the authors observed that the extent of inhibition<br>
and minimum inhibition concentration decreased with increase in polymer molecular<br>
weight and sialic acid content, it was also noted that not all sialic acid ligands were<br>
involved in binding with the virus. This clearly indicates need of tailoring the polymer<br>
structure so that higher fraction of ligands is involved in binding.<br>
Spevak et al. (J. Am. Chem. Soc., 115,1146-1147, 1993) reported the polymerized<br>
liposomes containing C-glycosides of sialic acid, which were potent inhibitors of<br>
influenza virus. Moreover the authors demonstrated that the infection was inhibited<br>
more effectively when the ligand bearing monomer was polymerized.<br>
Various methods have been reported in the past to synthesize multivalent ligands such<br>
as ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP). ROMP has been used to generate<br>
defined, biologically active polymers by Gibson et al., (Chem. Comm., 1095-<br>
1096,1997) and Biagini et al., (Polymer, 39, 1007-1014,1998).<br>
Recent advancements in the field of glycoscience have demonstrated enhanced<br>
binding between carbohydrate ligands and specific receptors as a result of the cluster<br>
effect. These interactions are result from intrinsic properties of such ligands.<br>
Various methods have been reported in the past for the synthesis of glycoconjugate<br>
oligomers and the clusters for the receptor binding activity. Nishimora, et al.<br>
(Macromolecules, 27, 4876-4880,1994) synthesized sugar homopolymer clusters from<br>
aery lam idoalkyl glycosides of7V-Acetyl-D-Glucosamine. On addition of the polymer<br>
clusters, binding to WGA was enhanced.<br>
Various methods for the preparation of random, block or graft copolymers containing<br>
jV-isopropyl acrylamide monomer are reported in the past. e.g. a number of monomers<br>
including butyl methacrylate, W-isopropyl methacrylamide and dextran sulfate have<br>
been polymerized with 7V-isopropyl acrylamide to prepare random copolymers.<br>
Hoffman et al. (J. Biomater. Sci., Polym. Ed., 4(5), 545 (1993) synthesized carboxyl<br>
terminated poly(yV-isopropyl acrylamide) oligomers, which were reacted with<br>
biopolymers to form thermo-reversible polymer-enzyme conjugates.<br>
Therefore, the objective of the present work is to synthesize copolymers containing<br>
polyvalent ligand for enhanced interactions with the substrates.<br>
Chitosan is linear, binary heteropolysaccharide and consists of 2-aceta amido-2-<br>
deoxy - p-D-glucose (GlcNAc; A-unit) and 2-amino 2-deoxy-p-D-glucose (GlcNAc,<br>
D-unit). The active site of lysozyme comprises subsites designated A-F. Specific<br>
binding of chitosan sequences to lysozyme begins with binding of the NAG units in<br>
the subsite C . Moreover, there is a need to synthesize ligands similar to repeat units<br>
of chitosan which will not be hydrolyzed by lysozyme. Moreover natural ligands<br>
derived from glucose are susceptible to microbial growth. The copolymers reported<br>
here are stable than chitin and chitosan reported earlier.<br>
In our another study entitled "Oligomers and Preparation Thereof'(Copending<br>
application No.), the applicants have shown that the oligomers of NAG in which the<br>
NAG groups are juxtaposed to one another, bind more effectively to lysozyme as<br>
reflected in values of binding constant (Kb) and the inhibition concentrations I50 In<br>
the conventional technique of free radical copolymerization the distribution of<br>
monomers along the polymer chain depends upon the values of the monomer<br>
reactivity ratios which are determined primarily by the intrinsic structure of the<br>
monomer. Consequently the distribution of the NAG units in the copolymers<br>
comprising monomers bearing NAG cannot be tailored at will using conventional<br>
copolymerization techniques.<br>
To overcome this problem the applicants have devised a novel strategy to ensure that<br>
the copolymers prepared using conventional free radical polymerization technique<br>
will always contain sequences of NAG units in juxtaposition.<br>
The applicants have further demonstrated that copolymers containing various<br>
carbohydrates including NAG units as macromers, bind to lysozyme more strongly as<br>
evidenced by values of Kb and inhibit lysozyme more efficiently as evidenced by<br>
values of I so- Thus the present invention provides copolymers various carbohydrates<br>
including NAG for a biomolecular target and method for preparation thereof.<br>
The approach described to prepare copolymers of various carbohydrates including<br>
NAG is simple and can be used to synthesize other macromeric ligands such as sialic<br>
acid which bind to influenza virus and rotavirus. Such copolymers may be even used<br>
as antiinfective agents both for prevention and treatment of diseases. Moreover,<br>
resultant copolymers reported are thermoprecipitating polymers which maybe used<br>
for the recovery of biomolecules such as lysozyme and lectins.<br>
The copolymers various carbohydrates including NAG conjugated to polyvalent<br>
ligands may also further be used in the treatment of bacterial or viral infections, and<br>
are expected not to cause drug resistance.<br>
The approach described herein is a generic one and can be extended to other systems<br>
as well for example sialic acid.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides methods for the preparation of copolymers containing<br>
various carbohydrates including polyvalent ./V-Acetyl Glucosamine (NAG). The<br>
copolymers in this invention are prepared by free radical polymerization method,<br>
which is convenient and simple. In the process of copolymerization reported here<br>
result in juxtaposition arrangement of polyvalent ligand sequences. Thus, the<br>
copolymers provide improved binding and inhibition in term of binding constant (Kb)<br>
and inhibition concentration (I50) respect. Copolymers reported here can be used for<br>
prevention of viral infections and recoveries of biomolecules.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the copolymers containing various carbohydrates<br>
including NAG for applications in medicine and biotechnology. Another aspect of the<br>
present invention is to use copolymers for enhanced interactions with biomolecules.<br>
It is possible to prepare either water-soluble or water-insoluble polymers by changing<br>
the chemical composition of the monomers, which may impart various chemical and<br>
physical properties, e.g. water-soluble monomers such as 7V-isopropyl acrylamide<br>
(NIPA) may be homopolymerized to form water-soluble homopolymers.<br>
Many polymers such as polysaccharides and polyacrylics which are water insoluble<br>
are being used in the biochemistry, affinity chromatography and immunoassays as<br>
solid-phase supports with passively adsorbed or covalently linked antibodies.<br>
A further aspect of the present invention is to prepare copolymers comprising a<br>
polyvalent carbohydrate ligands.<br>
The term "copolymer" means any polymer prepared by using acrylic or methacrylic<br>
acid, acryloyl or methacryloyl chloride, glycidyl acrylate or methacrylate, glycerol<br>
acrylate or methacrylate, allyl chloride; hydroxy-lower-alkyl-acrylates, such as 2-<br>
hydroxyethyl methacrylate or 3-hydroxypropyl methacrylate, and amino-loweralkylacrylates,<br>
such as 2-amino-ethyl methacrylate with polymerizable polyvalent<br>
ligands containing NAG, sialic acid or mannose. Monomers, which are soluble in<br>
water or water/polar organic solvent mixtures, are particularly preferred.<br>
A "polyvalent ligand" means any polymer containing ligands W-Acetyl Glucosamine,<br>
mannose, galactose and sialic acid, fructose, ribulose, erythrolose, xylulose, psicose,<br>
sorbose, tagatose, glucopyranose, fructofuranose, deoxyribose, galactosamine,<br>
Sucrose, lactose, isomaltose, maltose, cellobiose, cellulose and amylase. Polyvalent ligands are soluble in water or water/polar organic solvent mixtures are preferred NAG is derived from chitosan which is a lineqr, binary heteropolysaccharide and consists 2-acetaamido-2-deoxy - ß-D-glucose (GlcNAc ; A-unit) and 2-amino 2-deoxy-ß-D-gIucose (GlcNAc, D-umt). Chitosan is a powerful natural ligand, which binds to lysozyme through the NAG residues. But is suffers from three major limitations) Chitosan is insoluble at neutral pH, which limits many applications. 2) Chitosan undergoes the transglycosylation and mutarotation, which substantially reduces its activity and efficiency 3) Chitosan is hydrolyzed by lysozyme.<br>
Accordingly the object of present invention is to provide a simply and novel process for the preparation of copolymers comprising carbohydrates including polyvalent NAG, which exhibit multivalent interactions. The merits of the approach have been highlighted using NAG as an illustration.<br>

acrylamide (NIPA) and Acryloyl 6-Amino Caproic Acid Poly.Acryloyl N-Acetyl<br>
Glucosamine (Macromer)<br>
4 gm of AMsoprpopyl acrylamide (NIPA) and 0.5 gm of Acryloyl 6-Amino Caproic<br>
Acid Poly.Acryloyl jV-Acetyl Glucosamine (Macromer) was placed in a reactor and<br>
dissolved in 25 ml distilled water and stirred continuously. The resulting mixture was<br>
nitrogen purged and 1 % ammonium per sulphate was added as initiator. 1 % TEMED<br>
was used as accelerator. The copolymerization was carried 30 ° C for 4 hrs. Polymer<br>
was precipitated in diethyl ethyl and reprecipitated to remove unreacted monomer.<br>
Vacuum dried the polymer at room temperature.<br>
Example 3<br>

under nitrogen purging by addition of 1% (w/w) of ammonium per sulfate as a<br>
initiator and 1% v/w of TEMED (accelerator) for 4 hours. The polymer obtained was<br>
precipitated in diethyl ether. The polymer was reprecipitated with diethyl ether and<br>
dried under vacuum at room temperature.<br>
Example 4<br>
This example describes estimation of binding constant (Kb ) for copolymers<br>
containing NAG incorporated as monomer and macromer by fluorescence<br>
spectrophotometric method and the enhancement resulting from conjugation with<br>
monomers and monomer containing spacer.<br>
Fluorescence spectra of lysozyme were recorded on a Perkin Elmer LS-50 B<br>
luminescence spectrophotometer. Excitation frequency was 285 nm. Solutions of<br>
lysozyme and 7V-Acetyl Glucosamine were prepared in 0.066 M phosphate buffer pH<br>
6.2, containing 0.0154 M sodium chloride and 0.008 M sodium azide. 0.1 milliliter of<br>
lysozyme 80 jag /ml was mixed with solution containing different ligand<br>
concentration in a 2 ml capacity 10 mm square quartz cells maintained at 18 ° C.<br>
Phosphate buffer was added to make the volume to 2 ml. The fluorescence intensities<br>
of the solutions were measured, relative to the solutions containing enzymes and<br>
buffer mixtures of the identical concentrations reference. The relative fluorescence<br>
intensity of lysozyme saturated with solution containing different ligand<br>
concentration, FQC, was extrapolated from the experimental values by plotting I/ (Fo-<br>
F) against 1/[S] where F is the measured fluorescence of a solution containing enzyme<br>
with given substrate concentration [S] and F0 is the fluorescence of the solution of<br>
enzyme alone (Chipman et al., J. Biol. Chem., 242-19, 4388-4394,1967). The highest<br>
concentration of polymer substrates was used when enzyme was saturated more than<br>
85 %.<br>
The binding constant for Copolymers of NIP A and Ac.NAG are summarized in Table<br>
1 . wherein, polymers containing 42 mole % NAG has binding constant 2.05 x 10 5,<br>
which shows 2556 folds enhancement to NAG (5.24 xlO2).<br>
The binding constant for Copolymers of NIPA and Macromer are summarized in<br>
Table 2 wherein, polymers containing 17 % moles NAG has binding constant 2.45 x<br>
105, which shows 2138 folds enhancement to NAG (5.24 xlO2).<br>
Example 5<br>
This example describes the estimation of inhibition of lysozyme by copolymers.<br>
Micrococcus lysodeikticus is a substrate for the enzyme lysozyme. Relative binding of<br>
copolymers was estimated by using a procedure reported by Neuberger and Wilson<br>
(1967).<br>
1.5 % w/v stock solutions of copolymer was prepared in 0.0066 M phosphate buffer<br>
pH 6.2 containing 0.0154 m sodium chloride and 0.008 M sodium azide. One<br>
milliliter of stock solution containing different copolymer concentration was mixed<br>
with 1.6 ml of 78 |^g/ml of Micrococcus lysodeikticus in a 3-ml capacity glass cuvette.<br>
The mixture was incubated for 5 minutes at 20 ° C. To this mixture 0.1 ml of<br>
lysozyme (27 jig/ml) was added and mixed thoroughly. The relative absorbance at<br>
450 nm (A 450) was recorded for 30 seconds. A blank reading without the copolymer<br>
was noted and the change in the absorbance per second was calculated. Then relative<br>
inhibition was calculated.<br>
The relative inhibition of lysozyme in terms of I so has decreased to 0.0026 for<br>
oligomer of molecular weight 638 and is almost 28000 folds lower to NAG. The<br>
inhibition for macromer is 0.00268 mM, which shows more than 27,000 folds<br>
decrease to NAG (74 mM). The I max increased from 55.29 to 94.1.(Table 3).<br>
The relative inhibition of lysozyme in terms of I 50 for copolymers of NIPA and<br>
Ac.NAG NAG has decreased to 0.0057 mM for 42 mole % NAG. I 50 decreased<br>
almost 13700 folds lower to NAG. The I max increased from 55.29 to 72.50. (Table 4).<br>
The relative inhibition of lysozyme in terms of I 50 for copolymers of NIPA and<br>
Macromer has decreased to 0.000120 mM for 40 % mole NAG. 150 decreased almost<br>
6,166,66 folds lower to NAG. The I max increased from 55.29 to 89.65 (Table 5).<br>
