Polymers have replaced metals, glass, ceramics and papers in packaging, automobiles, building construction, electronics, electrical equipment, furniture, pipes and heavy industrial equipments. In a nutshell, from agriculture to transport and aerospace to food packaging, the use of plastics has become an integral part of our daily life. Polymers, all natural and synthetic, in common use, are susceptible to thermal/ photo-oxidative degradation upon exposure to natural and artificial weathering. The deterioration of these polymeric materials is mainly due to the UV portion of sunlight reaching the earth surface. The net result of degradation is the loss in the molecular weight and macroscopic physical properties. In order to avoid this loss different types of photo-stabilizers have been devised that protect the polymeric substrate from detrimental effect of light. The compatible and mobile light stabilizers usually prove to be the best choice to attain the desired photostability. Most of these stabilizers are commercially available and are successfully employed, single and/or in combination with other stabilizers for the polymer stabilization. Researchers have even attempted to study the combined effect of screeners, quenchers, ultraviolet absorbers and thermal stabilizers. An ample literature on the synthesis and application of these photostabilizers is available to date. Depending upon the type of combination, the effect of the stabilizers can be synergistic and antagonistic. The efficacy of the stabilizer depends on many factors viz. type of combination, proportion of additive, compatibility with the polymer and molecular weight of the stabilizer. Hindered amine light stabilizer (HALS) and benzotriazole based UV absorbers are known to<br><br>
work in synergism and there is no literature on the synthesis of the coupled derivatives of HALS and UV absorbers. Keeping in view, all the above-mentioned requirements we have designed and synthesized a novel HALS coupled to an UV absorber. Following patents and literature provide information about synthesis of the photo-stabilizers and the photo-stabilization efficiencies of HALS and UV absorbers solely in presence of each other. JP 2000119260: April 2000, US 5977219 A2: November 1999, JP 4263874 A2 September 1999, EP 924248 Al: June 1999, US 5739348 A: April 1998, W0 9739052 Al: October 1997, US 5362881 A November 1994, US 5086097 A4 February 1994, Polym. Photochem., 5, 351 (1984), Polym. Degrad. Stab., 8, 133 (1984) and Polym. Degrad. Stab.32,71 (1991). The process for the synthesis of compound having formula (II) has been disclosed in our co-pending patent No. (Foreign Appl. 09/749,277). Moreover, an online search using SCIFINDER and CHEMICAL ABSTRACT search engines didn't reveal any molecule similar to that, we have claimed over here.<br>
The objective of the present invention is therefore, to provide a process for the preparation of novel Tinuvin P-Hindered Amine Light Stabilizer (TP-HALS) derivatives, which can fulfill the above-mentioned prerequisites. Moreover, this class of combination of HALS and benzotriazole are known to be compatible with polyolefins, polycarbonate, polystyrene and diene-elastomers and can even be added in an additive proportion to obtain desired photo-stability of various other polymers.

Example 1<br>
Synthesis of 2-(2'-tert-butyldimetylsilyIoxy-5'-bromomethylphenyl) benzotriazole<br>
This compound was synthesized strictly under dry and inert reaction conditions. In a 100 mL capacity RB, 2-(2'-hydroxy-5'-bromomethyl phenyl) benzotriazole (3.0 gms, 0.00986M) was taken along with imidazole (2.1 gm, 0.0295 M) and applied an inert atmosphere using Argon gas. Added 10 ml of dry pyridine and agitated the reaction mixture for 20-60 min. The reaction mixture becomes very thick and difficult to stir. To this mixture, tert-butyl dimethyl silyl chloride (5.2 g, 0.0345 M) was added under inert condition and continued agitating the reaction mixture for 10-14 hrs. After checking the TLC for the completion of the reaction, the pyridine from the RB was evaporated to dryness under vacuum. The contents of the RB were consequently dissolved in 15 mL dichloromethane. The insoluble mass was filtered off and the mother liquor was evaporated under vacuum to give (a semi crystalline rust colored compound) 2-(2'-tert-butyl-di-metylsilyloxy-5'-bromomethylphenyl)benzotriazole. The crude product weighed 3.30 gms to give 80 % yield. The crude compound was purified using column chromatography employing a suitable solvent system. The yield of the pure compound was 76 % and its m.p. = 162-164° C.<br><br>
Example 2 Synthesis of 2-[2'-tert-butyldimetylsilyloxy-5'-methyIeneoxy(( 1", 2", 2", 6", 6"-pentamethyl —4"- piperidinyl) phenyl )benzotriazole<br>
This compound was synthesized strictly under dry and inert reaction conditions. The compound 2-(2'-tert-butyl-di-metylsilyloxy-5'-bromomethylphenyl)benzotriazole (2.1 gms, 0.00501 M) was taken in one 25 mL capacity RB and dissolved in 8 mL dry dimethylformamide (DMF) under Argon atmosphere with stirring. In an another two necked RB, l,2,2,6,6-pentamethyl-4-piperidinol (1.0356 gm, 0.00601 M) and sodium hydride (0.3 gms, 0.01252 M) were taken and dissolved in 6 mL dry DMF with stirring under Argon atmosphere. This reaction mixture was agitated for almost 60 min and then cooled to 4-8 °C. To this reaction mixture added the contents of the first RB gradually over a period of 30-60 min. This reaction mixture was further agitated for 2-4 hrs followed by refluxing the same for a period of 2-4 hrs. The contents of the RB were cooled to room temperature and further agitated for 4-6 hrs at room temperature. The solvent in the RB was evaporated under reduced pressure and the solid mass in the RB was dissolved in 15 mL water and repeatedly extracted with dichloromethane (4x10 mL). Dichloromethane was then evaporated under vacuum at 38 °C over a rotavapor to give pale yellow colored crystalline product 2-[2'-tert-butyldimetylsilyloxy-5'-methyleneoxy((l", 2", 2", 6", 6"-pentamethyl4"-piperidinyl) phenyl )benzotriazole. The TLC showed very little amount of unreacted starting material. The crude yield was 2.22gms (87%). The product was purified by rectystalization technique using an appropriate organic solvent to get (83 %) yield of pure product.<br><br>
Example 3 Synthesis of 2-[2'-hydroxy-5'-methyleneoxy(( 1", 2", 2", 6", 6"-pentamethyl -4"-piperidinyl) phenyl )benzotriazole<br>
The compound 2-[2'-tert-butyldimetylsilyloxy-5'-methyleneoxy(( 1", 2", 2", 6", 6"-pentamethyl—4"- piperidinyl) phenyl )benzotriazole (2.0 g, 0.003937 M) was taken in an RB with a tetrabutyl ammonium fluoride [ 4.71 mL, 0.004724 M (1.0 M solution in THF)] and agitated the reaction mixture at room temperature for 1-3 hrs under anhydrous conditions, followed by addition of 10 mL water and extracting the product in DCM (4x10 mL). The solvent was dried with anhydrous magnesium sulfate after neutralization with anhydrous potassium carbonate. Evaporating the solvent gave the product 2-[2'-tert-butyldimetylsilyloxy-5'-methyleneoxy (( 1", 2", 2", 6", 6"-penta methyl -4"-piperidinyl) phenyl )benzotriazole with a crude yield of 1.39 gms. (90 %). The process of the present invention has four distinct merits:<br>
1)	The process is an economic.<br>
2)	The process comprises of commonly available organic reagents and mild reaction conditions.<br>
3)	High yield (&gt; 75 %) can be achieved very easily.<br>
4)	Reaction can be carried out via very facile route with very simple and moderate reaction conditions.<br><br><br><br><br>
