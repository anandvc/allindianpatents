				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Diaphragm electrolyte cells are predominantly used in the world-wide production1 of<br>
chlorine, about 45 million tons per year. Production of chlorine is carried out in<br>
electrolytic cells of different types; among these, the diaphragm electrolytic cell, by<br>
means of which about 22 million tons of chlorine per year are produced, has a great<br>
relevance.<br>
A diaphragm electrolytic cell is generally composed of four main parts, as known to the<br>
experts in the art: a copper anodic base, lined with a protective titanium sheet, an<br>
anodic package, consisting of a multiplicity of anodes disposed in parallel rows and<br>
secured to said base, a carbon steel cathodic body, comprising a plurality of cathodes<br>
upon which a porous diaphragm is deposited, secured to a current distributor and<br>
disposed in parallel rows so that they can be intercalated to the above anodes according<br>
to a so-called "finger-type" geometry, and a cover, usually of chlorine-resistant plastic<br>
material provided with the nozzles for feeding the brine and discharging the product<br>
chlorine.<br>
In consideration of the high number of installed cells (about 25000 world-side), of the<br>
high amount of energy involved in their operation (about 60 millions of MWh/year) and<br>
of the continuous increase in the cost of electricity, the cell diaphragm technology has<br>
been, in the course of the years, remarkably improved. Among the many technological<br>
innovations which offered the major contributions for decreasing the energy<br>
consumption, the following must be noticed:<br>
the replacement of the traditional graphite anodes with box-shaped<br>
perforated metallic anodes (the so-called "box" type anodes) made of<br>
titanium, coated with electrocatalytic material based on noble metals and/or<br>
oxides thereof.<br>
The replacement of fixed sized "box" anodes with the so-called "expandable<br>
anodes", as disclosed in US 3,674,676, allowing for the reduction of the<br>
interelectrodic gap.<br>
- the suppression of the above interelectrodic gap through the introduction,<br>
within the expandable anodes, of means for exerting a pressure between the<br>
anodes and the diaphragm, as disclosed in US 5,534,122<br>
- the evolution of the expandable anode through the introduction of the double<br>
expander, as disclosed in US 5,993,620, whereto a lower ohmic drop is<br>
associated.<br>
It may be observed that the cited innovations are all directed to improve the<br>
performances in terms of energetic consumption, by means of either an<br>
increase of the electrocatalytic activity, or an optimisation of the electrode<br>
structure, or again through the reduction of the interpolar gap and the increase<br>
in the mass transfer (lower bubble effect and higher electrolyte circulation)<br>
obtained through small modifications which do not imply a substantial redesign<br>
of the cell structure and thus of easy implementation and reduced costs.<br>
Other solutions proposed in the past provide a modification of the cell, and in<br>
particular of the cathodic package, directed to increase the electrodic surface<br>
thereby decreasing the current density at a given applied total current, and as a<br>
consequence the cell voltage and the overall energetic consumption.<br>
A further issue of present great relevance is given by the need of increasing the<br>
electric load and thus the production; such need is often in contradiction with<br>
the lack of a suitable area allowing the installation of additional electrolytic cells.<br>
In the co-pending unpublished International Application PCT/EP 02/10848, a<br>
solution allowing the increase of the cell active surface with the same projected<br>
area is disclosed, by means of the construction of a cell made of a plurality of<br>
vertically overlaid modules provided with the conventional interdigitated anodes.<br>
This solution is in itself promising, although entailing quite substantial<br>
investment costs.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a new diaphragm electrolytic<br>
cell overcoming the drawbacks of the prior art.<br>
In particular, it is an object of the present invention to provide a diaphragm<br>
electrolytic cell comprising a multiplicity of overlaid modules of anodes and<br>
cathodes, the anodes of at least part of the modules allowing for a substantial<br>
reduction of the construction cost.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention consists of a diaphragm electrolytic cell made of a lower module<br>
and of an upper module or a multiplicity of upper modules vertically overlaid<br>
thereto, wherein the upper modules are provided with generally U- <br>
shaped anodes, comprising two vertical major surfaces fixed to a horizontal<br>
current collector, housing the corresponding cathodes within.<br>
The two vertical major surfaces of the anodes may be part of a single folded<br>
surface; they are preferably foraminous, to allow the circulation of the<br>
electrolyte, and are preferably provided with an electrocatalytic coating for<br>
chlorine evolution.<br>
In order to facilitate the understanding of the invention, reference will be made<br>
to the attached figures, which are not to be intended as limiting the invention<br>
itself, whose domain is solely limited by the appended claims.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 shows a diaphragm electrolytic cell of the prior art, according to the<br>
teaching of the co-pending non published International Application PCT/EP<br>
02/10848. The illustrated cell consists of two vertically overlaid modules, an<br>
upper module (100) and a lower module (200), according to the most common<br>
embodiment; it is intended that the upper module (100) may be replaced by a<br>
plurality of vertically stacked upper modules, as disclosed in the cited co-<br>
pending application. The lower module (200) comprises a copper anode base<br>
(1), lined with a titanium protective sheet (not evidenced) whereto a plurality of<br>
anodes (3) is secured in parallel rows, by means of current collecting stems (4)<br>
intercalated to the cathodes (5). The surface of the anodes is preferably made<br>
of a grid of perforated sheet or rhomboidal-shaped expanded sheet coated with<br>
an electrocatalytic material. The cathodic package consists of a box (6) with<br>
open top and bottom, known as cathodic body, with a current distributor (30),<br>
provided with a plurality of cathodes (5) fixed inside, secured in correspondence<br>
of the external surface thereof. The cathodes (5), known as fingers, are shaped<br>
as tubular boxes with a flat elongated cross-section and are arranged in parallel<br>
rows intercalated to the rows of anodes (3); the two ends of the cathodes (5)<br>
are connected with a manifold (7) running along the four sides of the box (6).<br>
The cathode is made for example of an iron perforated sheet or mesh, with the<br>
diaphragm deposited on the external surface thereto, facing the anode. The<br>
diaphragm has the purpose of separating the anodic compartment from the<br>
cathodic one avoiding the mixing of the two gases and of the solutions;<br>
originally it was made of polymer modified asbestos, but the technological<br>
evolution has led to the adoption of composite asbestos-free diaphragms. The<br>
diaphragm may also consist of an ion-exchange membrane or other<br>
semipermeable material. The upper module (100) also comprises anodic and<br>
cathodic packages, substantially with the same construction materials as in the<br>
lower module (200) but in most of the cases of lower height. The upper anodic<br>
package is comprised of a frame (15), acting as the upper anodic base and<br>
ensuring for the mechanical support and the current distribution for the relevant<br>
anodes (16). The frame (15) is made of a titanium sheet provided with holes or<br>
slots, suitably dimensioned for putting the two anodic compartments in direct<br>
fluid communication. The anodes (16) of the upper module are vertically fixed to<br>
the frame, in transversal rows, generally with the same pitch as in the lower<br>
module. The anodes (16) of the upper module, fixed to the frame (15) by means<br>
of dowel screws (18), often have a lower height. The upper eathodic body is<br>
made of a box (19), having the same design and construction materials as that<br>
of the lower module and a height depending on that of the upper anodic<br>
package; the upper cathodic body is welded along the internal walls of the box<br>
(19) to a plurality of cathodes (20) arranged in parallel rows. Each finger,<br>
shaped as an elongated tubular box, is in communication with a manifold (21)<br>
positioned along the sides of the box (19). The main features of the cathodes<br>
and diaphragms of the upper module are equivalent to those of the lower<br>
module. The frame (15) and the anode base (1) are reciprocally connected by<br>
means of external conductors (not shown in the figure); the box (6) and the box<br>
(19) are also connected in a similar way. The cell cover (8), which is made a of<br>
plastic chlorine-resistant material, is provided with a chlorine gas outlet (9) and<br>
a brine inlet (10). The cell is connected to a direct current supply by means of<br>
bus bars. As known to the experts in the art, the cell operates as follows: the<br>
feed brine enters the cell through the inlet nozzle (10) placed on the cell cover<br>
and is distributed through pipe (23) to the base (1) of the lower anodic<br>
compartment, subsequently rising to the top surface thereof and overflowing<br>
through the slots of the frame (15) into the anodic space of the box (19). The<br>
chlorine disengaged in the lower anodic compartment follows the same path<br>
and leaves through the outlet nozzle (9) on the cover (8). The chloride-depleted<br>
electrolyte, driven by the pressure corresponding to the hydraulic head between<br>
the anolyte and catholyte, permeates through the diaphragm entering the upper<br>
(20) and lower (5) cathodic fingers. Hydrogen leaves the upper (21) and lower<br>
(7) cathodic compartments respectively through nozzles (25) and (11),<br>
connected in parallel to the hydrogen manifold (26). The alkali produced in the<br>
upper cathodic compartment (21) leaves through nozzle (27), and enters the<br>
lower cathodic chamber (7) through pipe (28) and nozzle (29), where it is mixed<br>
with°the alkali produced therein, then leaving the cell through the hydraulic head<br>
(12). The level of the cathodic liquor is normally adjusted so that a sufficient gas<br>
chamber is always maintained in the lower cathodic compartment (7);<br>
consequently, the upper compartment (21) works exclusively as a gas chamber<br>
and electrolysis takes place only by direct contact between the solution<br>
percolating onto the diaphragm and the cathode. To establish such condition in<br>
a reliable fashion, the pipe (28) must obviously have a sufficient large diameter<br>
in order to remain substantially full of hydrogen, so that the two cathodic<br>
compartments (7) and (21) are subjected to an identical pressure.<br>
Figure 2 shows a particular embodiment of the anode of the invention, which is<br>
conceived in a completely different manner with respect to the prior art anodes, with or<br>
without expander. As it can be observed, the anode structure is given by an electrodic<br>
surface (13), folded and open on one side to allow the insertion of a cathode,<br>
preferably consisting of a foraminous sheet or a mesh or, as an alternative, of a<br>
juxtaposition of foraminous elements such as sheets or meshes. The anode has a single<br>
curvature (14), its profile thereby assuming a U-shaped geometry, other shapes of the<br>
said profile being possible without departing from the scope of invention. At the base of<br>
the anode, in correspondence of the curvature (14), a current collector (150) provided<br>
with a preferably threaded stem (160) is welded or otherwise secured. The current<br>
collector (150) is horizontal instead of vertical as it would be the case of the prior art, as<br>
this allows the internal volume of the anode to be hollow and completely available for<br>
the insertion of the corresponding cathode. In principle, both the anodes of the upper<br>
module (100) and of the lower module (200) could be realized according to the<br>
embodiment of figure 2. However, the cell construction illustrated in figure 1 derives, in<br>
most of the case, from a retrofitting of an older diaphragm cell wherein the upper<br>
module is overlaid to the lower one in a second time, as disclosed in the co-pending<br>
International Application PCT/EP 02/10848. The anodes of the lower module (200) have<br>
therefore, in most of the cases, a geometry according to the prior art. Also when a<br>
complete replacement of the electrodes of the lower module is carried out, the<br>
advantage of employing the anode of figure 2 is partially counteracted by the fact that<br>
the anodes (3) of the lower module (200) are usually quite high (for instance 800 mm);<br>
the lack of an internal current collector may entail, in this case, substantial ohmic<br>
penalties thus lowering the faradaic yield. The anodes (16) of the upper module (100)<br>
have conversely a much reduced typical height (for instance 160 mm, as specified in the<br>
cited International Application PCT/EP 02/10848), and conducting the electric current<br>
along their whole height without resorting to internal current collectors is therefore a<br>
negligible issue. For this reason, in a preferred embodiment, the cell of the invention<br>
makes use of the anodes of figure 2 only for the upper module (100).<br>
In another embodiment, the cell of the invention makes use of such anodes also<br>
for the lower module (200), counteracting the increase in the ohmic drop along<br>
the electrode height with additional vertical current collectors (not shown),<br>
secured to the external surfaces of the anodes. The optional additional titanium-<br>
lined copper current collectors, secured externally and not internally, are much<br>
easier to remove and restore, contributing in a sensible manner to reduce the<br>
costs of reactivation.<br>
Fixing the current collectors to the anodes externally instead of internally also<br>
offers an additional benefit: when the catalytic coating is periodically<br>
deactivated, the anode must be in fact subjected to a reactivation, preceded by<br>
an etching treatment in hot concentrated hydrochloric or sulphuric acid. After<br>
applying the catalytic ink, the anode must be treated in oven at about 500°C.<br>
During these treatments, the bimetallic contact between the copper core of the<br>
state-of-the-art current collector and the relevant titanium lining would be<br>
seriously damaged by distortion phenomena, the previous detachment of the<br>
current collector and ?1s subsequent restoring after the treatment being<br>
therefore required. With the illustrated anode however, the horizontal current<br>
collector can be entirely made of titanium, with little prejudice in terms of ohmic<br>
drops, therefore no problems arise during the heat treatment of reactivation.<br>
Figure 3 shows a second particular embodiment of the anode of the invention,<br>
whose conception is not too far from the anode of figure 2. Once more, its<br>
structure is open allowing the cathode to be housed within; in this case,<br>
however, the electrodic surface (13) is formed by two distinct elements,<br>
disposed in the vertical position and secured to the current collector (150) in<br>
correspondence of one edge (17). The nature of the electrodic surface (13) is<br>
fundamentally equivalent to the one described for the previous embodiment; the<br>
use of foraminous elements such as sheets or meshes, or juxtapositions<br>
thereof, is preferred.<br>
Figure 4 is a sketch of a side view of a possible configuration of an upper<br>
module (100), according to the best mode of carrying out the invention; the<br>
same configuration could be used for the lower module (ZOO), without departing<br>
from the scope of the invention. The particular shape of the anode (16), with an<br>
open upper part and the interior free of obstacles, may be exploited for housing<br>
the cathode (20) within, so that the reduction of the electrode pitch is virtually<br>
limited by the sole thickness of the cathode (20). The adjacent anodes, in fact,<br>
can be very close to each other ad even in mutual contact, as they are<br>
maintained at the same electric potential. The figure shows also constraint<br>
elements (31), applied to adjacent pairs of anodes, that are used to open wide<br>
the latter under elastic regime so as to facilitate the insertion of the cathodes<br>
during the assembly (figure 4A); figure 4B shows how, upon completing the<br>
assembly and removing the constraint elements, the anodic surface moves<br>
back to the natural position, with the two vertical sides facing the diaphragm-<br>
coated major surfaces of the corresponding cathode (20). In figure 4, the anode<br>
(16) has an open upper part, but it is clearly possible to assemble the anodes<br>
upside down, with an open lower part. It is also possible to provide an assembly<br>
procedure that doesn't make use of constraint elements, or that utilises the<br>
same in a different fashion, without departing from the scope of the invention.<br>
The constructive solution illustrated in figure 4 easily allows an increase of<br>
active surface of 30-50% for the relevant module and for a given projected<br>
surface.<br>
In the description and claims of the present application, the word "comprise"<br>
and its variation such as "comprising" and "comprises" are not intended to<br>
exclude the presence of other elements or additional components.<br>
