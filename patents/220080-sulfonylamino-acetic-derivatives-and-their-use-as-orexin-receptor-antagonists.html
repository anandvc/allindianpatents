ACTELION 26A/OR4<br>
Sulfonvlamino-acetic acid Derivatives<br>
The present invention relates to novel sulfonylamino-acetic acid derivatives of the general formula (I) and their use as pharmaceuticals. The invention also concerns related aspects including pharmaceutical compositions containing one or more compounds of formula I, and especially their use as orexin receptor antagonists.<br>
The orexins (hypocretins) comprise two neuropeptides produced in the hypothalamus: the orexin A (OX-A) (a 33 aminoacid peptide) and the orexin B (OX-B) (a 28 aminoacid peptide) (Sakurai T. et al9 Cell, 1998, 92, 573-585). Orexins are found to stimulate food consumption in rats suggesting a physiological role for these peptides as mediators in the central feedback mechanism that regulates feeding behavior (Sakurai T. et aL9 Cell, 1998, 92, 573-585). On the other hand, it was also proposed that orexins regulate states of sleep and wakefulness opening potentially novel therapeutic approaches for narcoleptic patients (Chemelli R.M. et al&gt; Cell, 1999, 98, 437-451). Two orexin receptors have been cloned and characterized in mammals which belong to the G-protein coupled receptor superfamily (Sakurai T. et al9 Cell, 1998, 92, 573-585), the orexin-1 receptor (OXi) which is selective for OX-A and the orexin-2 receptor (OX2) which is capable to bind OX-A as well as OX-B.<br>
Orexin receptors are found in the mammalian host and may be responsible for many pathologies including, but not limited to, depression; anxiety; addictions; obsessive compulsive disorder; affective neurosis; depressive neurosis; anxiety neurosis; dysthymic disorder; behaviour disorder; mood disorder; sexual dysfunction; psychosexual dysfunction; schizophrenia; manic depression; delerium; dementia; severe mental retardation and dyskinesias such as Huntington's disease and Tourette syndrome; feeding disorders such as anorexia, bulimia, cachexia and obesity; diabetes; appetite/taste disorders; vomiting/nausea; asthma; cancer; Parkinson' s disease; Cushing' s syndrome/disease; basophil adenoma; prolactinoma; hyperprolactinemia; hypopituitarism; hypophysis tumor/adenoma; hypothalamic diseases; inflammatory bowel disease; gastric diskinesia; gastric ulcus; Froehlich's syndrome; adrenohypophysis disease; hypophysis disease; pituitary growth hormone; adrenohypophysis hypoftmction; adrenohypophysis hyperfunction; hypothalamic hypogonadism; Kallman's syndrome (anosmia, hyposmia);<br><br>
functional or psychogenic amenorrhea; hypopituitarism; hypothalamic hypothyroidism; hypothalamic-adrenal dysfunction; idiopathic hyperprolactinemia; hypothalamic disorders of growth hormone deficiency; idiopathic growth deficiency; dwarfism; gigantism; acromegaly;-disturbed biological and circadian rhythms; sleep disturbances associated with deseases such as neurological disorders, neuropathic pain and restless leg syndrome; heart and lung diseases, acute and congestive heart failure; hypotension; hypertension; urinary retention; osteoporosis; angina pectoris; myocardinal infarction; ischaemic or haemonhagic stroke; subarachnoid haemorrhage; ulcers; allergies; benign prostatic hypertrophy; chronic renal failure; renal disease; impaired glucose tolerance; migraine; hyperalgesia; pain; enhanced or exaggerated sensitivity to pain such as hyperalgesia, causalgia, and allodynia; acute pain; burn pain; atypical facial pain; neuropathic pain; back pain; complex regional pain syndrome I and II; arthritic pain; sports injury pain; pain related to infection e.g. by HIV; post-chemotherapy pain; post-stroke pain; post-operative pain; neuralgia; conditions associated with visceral pain such as irritable bowel syndrome, migraine and angina; urinary bladder incontinence e.g. urge incontinence; tolerance to narcotics or withdrawal from narcotics; sleep disorders;-sleep apnea; narcolepsy; insomnia; parasomnia; jet-lag syndrome; delayed or advanced sleep phase syndrome; sleep related dystonias; and neurodegerative disorders including nosological entities such as disinMbition-dementia-parkinsonism-amyotrophy complex; pallido-ponto-nigral degeneration epilepsy, seizure disorders including febrile seizures and other hyperthermia disorders; and other diseases related to orexin.<br>
Up to now some low molecular weight compounds are known which have a potential to antagonise either specifically OXi or 0X2, or both receptors at the same time. In WO 99/09024, WO 99/58533, WO 00/47576, WO 00/47577 and WO 00/47580 formerly SmithKline Beecham reported phenylurea, phenylthiourea and cinnamide derivatives as OXi selective antagonists. More recently WO 01/85693 from Banyu Pharmaceuticals has been published wherein N-acyltetrahydroisoquinoline derivatives are disclosed.   2-Amino-methylpiperidine   derivatives   (WO   01/96302),   3-aminomethyl-<br>
s<br>
morpholine derivatives (WO 02/44172) and N-aroyl cyclic amines (WO 02/89800, WO 02/90355, WO 03/51368 and WO 03/51871) have been suggested by formerly SmithKline Beecham as orexin receptor antagonists. Related compounds are disclosed in WO 03/02559, WO 03/02561, WO 03/32991, WO 03/41711, WO 03/51872 and WO 03/51873.   In  WO  03/37847  formerly  SmithKline  Beecham reported benzamide<br><br>
derivatives as orexin receptor antagonists. International patent applications WO 01/68609 and WO 02/51838 disclose 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline and novel benzazepine derivatives as orexin receptor antagonists. The novel compounds of the present invention belong to an entirely different class of low molecular weight compounds as compared to all prior art orexin receptor antagonists so far published.<br>
The present invention comprises sulfonylamino-acetic acid derivatives which are non-peptide antagonists of the human orexin receptors, in particular the human orexin-2 receptor. These compounds, therefore, are of potential use in the treatment of disturbed homeostasis and eating disorders (e.g. bulimia, obesity, food abuse, compulsive eating or irritable bowel syndrome), as well as disturbed sleep/wake schedule, sleep disorders (e.g. insomnias, apneas, dystonias) or stress-related diseases (e.g. anxiety, mood and blood pressure disorders) or any other disease related to orexin dysfunction.<br>
WO 00/50391 discloses certain sulfonamide derivatives as modulators of the production of amyloid p-protein. WO 02/32864 discloses certain sulfanilide derivatives useiiil in the treatment of diseases mediated by oxytocin and/or vasopressin.<br>

The present invention further encompasses different morphological forms, e.g. crystalline forms, of compounds of general formula (I) and their salts and solvation complexes. Particular heteromorphs may exhibit different dissolution properties, stability profiles, and the like, and are all included in the scope of the present invention.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) might have one or several asymmetric centres and<br>
.can be present in the form of optically pure enantiomers, mixtures of enantiomers such as,<br>
for example, racemates, optically pure diastereoisomers, mixtures of diastereoisomers,<br>
diastereoisomeric racemates or mixtures of diastereoisomeric racemates and the meso-<br>
forms.<br>
Preferred compounds as described above have IC50 values below 100 nM, particularly preferred compounds have IC50 values below 20 nM which have been determined with the FLIPR (Fluorometric Imaging Plates Reader) method described in the beginning of the experimental section.<br>
The compounds of formula (T) and their pharmaceutically usable salts can be used for the treatment of diseases or disorders where an antagonist of a human orexin receptor is required such as obesity, diabetes, prolactinoma, narcolepsy, insomnia, sleep apnea, parasomnia, depression, anxiety, addictions, schizophrenia and dementia or any other disease related to orexin dysfunction.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) and their pharmaceutically usable salts are particularly useful for the treatment of disturbed homeostasis and eating disorders (e.g. bulimia, obesity, food abuse, compulsive eating or irritable bowel syndrome), as well as disturbed sleep/wake schedule, sleep disorders (e.g. insomnias, apneas, dystonias), stress-related diseases (e.g. anxiety, mood and blood pressure disorders), or any other disease related to orexin dysfunction.<br><br>
The compounds of formula (I) and their pharmaceutically usable salts can be used as medicament (e.g. in the form of pharmaceutical preparations). The pharmaceutical preparations can be administered enterally, such as orally (e.g. in the form of tablets, coated tablets, dragees, hard and soft gelatine capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions), nasally (e.g. in the form of nasal sprays) or rectaily (e.g. in the form of suppositories). However, the administration can also be effected parenterally, such as intramuscularly or intravenously (e.g. in the form of injection solutions), or topically, e.g. in the form of ointments, creams or oils.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) and their pharmaceutically usable salts can be processed with pharmaceutically inert, inorganic or organic adjuvants for the production of tablets, coated tablets, dragees, and hard gelatine capsules. Lactose, corn starch or derivatives thereof talc, stearic acid or its salts etc. can be used, for example, as such adjuvants for tablets, dragees, and hard gelatine capsules. Suitable adjuvants for soft gelatine capsules, are, for example, vegetable oils, waxes, fats, semi-solid substances and liquid polyols, etc. Suitable adjuvants for the production of solutions and syrups are, for example, water, polyols, saccharose, invert sugar, glucose, etc. Suitable adjuvants for injection solutions are, for example, water, alcohols, polyols, glycerol, vegetable oils, etc. Suitable adjuvants for suppositories are, for example, natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats, semi-solid or liquid polyols, etc.<br>
Morever, the pharmaceutical preparations can contain preservatives, solubilizers, viscosity-increasing substances, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, sweeteners, colorants, flavorants, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffers, masking agents or antioxidants. The compounds of formula (I) may also be used in combination with one or more other therapeutically useful substances. Examples are anorectic drugs like fenfluramine and related substances; lipase inhibitors like orlistat and related substances; antidepressants like fluoxetine and related substances; anxiolytics like alprazolam and related substances; sleep-inducers like zopiclone and related substances; or any other therapeutically useful substance.<br>
The dosage of compounds of formula (I) can vary within wide limits depending on the disease to be controlled, the age and the individual condition of the patient and the<br><br>
mode of administration, and will, of course, be fitted to the individual requirements in each particular case. For adult patients a daily dosage of about 1 mg to 1000 mg, especially about 50 mg to about 500 mg, comes into consideration.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations conveniently contain about 1 - 500 mg, preferably 5 - 200 mg of a compound of formula (T).<br>
The compounds of general formula (T) of the present invention are prepared according to the general sequence of reactions outlined in the schemes below, wherein A, B, R1, R2 are as defined in formula (T) above. As the case may be any compound obtained with one or more optically active carbon atom may be resolved into pure enantiomers or diastereomers, mixtures of enantiomers or diastereomers, diastereomeric racemates and the meso-forms in a maimer known per se.<br>
The compounds obtained may also be converted into a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof in a manner known per se.<br>

Compound libraries are prepared by multiple parallel synthesis using solution phase chemistry.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) have been prepared by following one out of three possible synthetic pathways. The first pathway starts with the reaction of an amine B-NH2 with an a-bromoacetamide, which might be synthesised starting from bromoacetyl bromide and an amine NHR!(CH2R2) either in situ or separately. In a second step the respective aminoacetamide was reacted with a sulfonyl chloride A-S02C1 (Scheme 7).<br><br>

The second synthetic route starts with the reaction of an amine B-NH2 with a sulfonyl chloride A-SQ2CI. From the intermediate sulfonamides the target molecules can be obtained by reaction with the respective a-bromoacetamide (Scheme 2).<br><br>
In a third pathway a sulfonamide is synthesized starting from an amine B-NH2 and a sulfonyl chloride A-SO2CI. The obtained sulfonamide is transformed to a t-butyl- or methyl acetate derivative by reaction with either tert-butyl bromoacetate or methyl bromoacetate. rhe ester is hydrolyzed and the obtained acid is coupled with an amine NHR (CEfeR ) to jive the desired amide (Scheme 3).<br><br><br><br>

HEPES, 5 mM probenecid (Sigma) and 3 \JM of the fluorescent calcium indicator fluo-3<br>
AM (1 mM stock solution in DMSO with 10% pluronic acid) (Molecular Probes) was<br>
added to each well.<br>
The 96-well plates were incubated for 60 min at 37° C in 5% CO2. The loading solution<br>
was then aspirated and cells were washed 3 times with 200 jil HBSS containing 2.5 mM<br>
probenecid, 0.1% BSA, 2 mM HEPES. 100 pi of that same buffer was left in each well.<br>
Within the Fluorescent Imaging Plate Reader (FLIPR, Molecular Devices), antagonists<br>
were added to the plate in a volume of 50 pi, incubated for 20 min and finally 100 JLXI of<br>
agonist was added. Fluorescence was measured for each well at 1 second intervals, and the<br>
height of each fluorescence peak was compared to the height of the fluorescence peak<br><br>
induced by 10 nM orexin-A with buffer in place of antagonist. For each antagonist, IC50 value (the concentration of compound needed to inhibit 50 % of the agonistic response) was determined. Selected compounds are displayed in Table L<br><br>
