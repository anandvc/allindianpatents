				<td>METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR PLACING A LONG DISTANCE CALL<br>
BASED ON A VIRTUAL PHONE NUMBER<br>
RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims priority from, and is a continuation-in-part of, US<br>
Patent Serial No. 10/774,689, filed February 10, 2004, the contents of which arc<br>
fully incorporated by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to placing calls. More specifically, the present<br>
invention relates optionally to a method, system, and apparatus for enabling a call,<br>
particularly a long-distance call, with an unproved cost structure, a non-locationlinked<br>
identifier, or an improved user-convenience.<br>
2, Description of the Related Art<br>
Traditional telephone systems employ a mix of local carriers (telephone<br>
service providers) and long distance carriers (telephone service providers spanning<br>
geographic distances). Local carriers connect calls within a given small geographic<br>
region (a defined local region). Local carriers are spread throughout the world, in<br>
different nations, geographic regions, and on different continents. Long distance<br>
carriers carry calls between local carriers.<br>
In conventional long distance systems, telephone lines connect a home or<br>
office directly to a "wire center" or a "communication center" are referred to<br>
generally herein as a central office unless otherwise described in context with an<br>
adaptive system. A central office (CO) has one or more switches, which route or<br>
direct telephone calls from one destination to another. A central office (CO) is<br>
conventionally understood as a telephone company building where subscriber lines<br>
are joined to complex switching equipment for connecting to others, either locally or<br>
long distance. See, Newton's Telecom Dictionary, by Harry Newton, 20th Ed., CMP<br>
Books, March 2004. Sometimes, a central office (CO) includes multiple switching<br>
exchanges and may be very large, and other times a central office (CO) may refer to<br>
a single telephone switch, depending upon context. Central offices (CO) are<br>
typically connected by a "trunk line", which is broadly termed a communication line<br>
between two or more switching systems or PBXs (Private Branch Exchange).<br>
Telephone numbers typically include an area code, and in the United States, a<br>
seven digit telephone number. The seven-digit telephone number includes a threedigit<br>
central office (CO) number, and a four-digit central office extension. The<br>
three-digit central office number directs conventional calls to a particular central<br>
office. Once the conventional call reaches the desired central office, the four-digit<br>
extension directs the call to the telephone line that is served by that central office.<br>
Area codes are typically used for long distance phone calls, as discussed<br>
below.<br>
Local telephone calls within a small geographic region (or "geographicumbrella")<br>
are often completed within a single central office location. In this<br>
configuration, the same central office often serves outgoing calls within the same<br>
geographic region, all under the geographic-umbrella of the local carrier. The<br>
central office connects the incoming call to the local destination number. Where the<br>
geographic region is slightly larger, two or more central offices, connected by a<br>
trunk, may process the call still under the umbrella of the local carrier. Employing<br>
this conventional system, a destination receives an outbound call from the first<br>
central office (CO), and then directs this call along trunk lines to an appropriate<br>
destination based upon the dialed phone number.<br>
Each area code corresponds to a particular group of central offices. In<br>
conventional use, when a call-originator dials an area code and then the seven-digit<br>
telephone number, the initial central office (CO) scrutinizes the dialed number and<br>
accesses a database. Where the dialed number is located within a Local Transport<br>
Access Area (LATA) or a service, the call is directed to the appropriate central<br>
office.<br>
A LATA is typically a contiguous geographic area. Where the dialed<br>
number is outside the LATA, the local central office (CO) access a database to<br>
determine which long distance service provider a user (identified by the calloriginating<br>
number) has selected to connect the call. The local service provider then<br>
switches the call to select lines that are connected to the identified long distance<br>
companies nearest switch, often referred to as a point of presence (POP). Once the<br>
long distance carrier receives the call, the long distance carrier accesses its own<br>
database and analyzes the called number to rout the call across the long distance<br>
provider's nearest POP located closest to the called-number. In operation, the POP<br>
conventionally functions to route the long distance call to a local central office (CO)<br>
nearest the identified destination phone. Once the long distance call is at the local<br>
central office (CO), the local service provider completes the call as discussed above.<br>
Unfortunately, long distance and local phone companies incur costs for<br>
various physical equipment systems, switching calls, and generally maintaining their<br>
physical equipment and training their employees. Each costs is eventually passed on<br>
to a consumer.<br>
In a conventional billing system, a call-originator pays a basic fixed fee for<br>
unlimited local calls. Unlike local calling, during "long distance calling," calls are<br>
transferred from a first local telephone company, to a long distance telephone<br>
company, and then back to a second (distant) local telephone company. As a<br>
consequence, since each switch transfer may incur a cost, multiple switching longdistance<br>
calling is more expensive than a local call. As an additional detriment, in<br>
conventional billing systems, long distance calls are frequently charged to the call<br>
originator on a "per minute" basis and may vary over the distance called. For<br>
example, long distance calls between countries may be higher than long distance<br>
calls within a given country.<br>
In sum, the negative aspects of the present long distance calling<br>
(telecommunication) system include variable charging, charging on a per-minute<br>
basis, and higher costs.<br>
As broadly described, ALI or Automatic Location Information systems<br>
enable users, working with a database, to associate a known physical location with a<br>
known telephone number. See, Newton's Telecom Dictionary, by Harry Newton,<br>
20th Ed., CMP Books, March 2004. All information is commonly employed in<br>
Emergency 911 systems or Enhanced 911 systems to allow managers to facilitate<br>
prompt service arrive during emergency situations.<br>
ANI, or Automatic Number Identification information, provides for<br>
transmission through a Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) of a Billing<br>
Number (BN) of an originating party. Unlike CLID (Calling Line Identification),<br>
ANI delivers the number of the calling party and cannot be normally blocked by a<br>
calling party without extensive effort. See, Newton's Telecom Dictionary, by Harry<br>
Newton, 20th Ed., CMP Books, March 2004.<br>
In sum, conventional identification systems exist, for example "Caller ID"<br>
and "Caller Location" type systems, that enable a called party to identify who the<br>
caller is and where a caller is located using conventional ALI and ANI information.<br>
It is often convenient, for business or other reasons, to rninimize or<br>
manipulate the information available to a call-receiver or a call-originator.<br>
In a first example, for personal vanity reasons, a call-originator may desire to<br>
advertise as having a famous but increasingly rare telephone area code (for example<br>
a "212" New York City area code), and may be physically located in New Jersey<br>
(for example a "201" Fair Lawn, NJ area code). Using conventional methods, the<br>
call-originator is forced by a local telephone service provider to place calls providing<br>
a "201" ALI/ANI information set that is accessible using conventional methods to<br>
the call-receiver, and the call-receiver is similarly forced to give out the "201" area<br>
code number to receive incoming calls.<br>
In a second example, for business reasons particularly for international<br>
business, a call originator may desire to advertise as having the same famous and<br>
rare telephone area code (the "212" New York City area code), and may also be<br>
physically located at the "201" Fair Lawn, NJ area code. Again, using conventional<br>
methods, the call-originator is forced by the local telephone service provider to place<br>
calls providing a "201" ALI/ANI information set that is accessible to the callreceiver,<br>
and the call-receiver is similarly forced to give out the "201" area code<br>
number to receive incoming calls.<br>
In a third example, for personal security reasons, a call-originator may desire<br>
to mislead or misdirect someone trying to determine the call-originator's actual local<br>
telephone service call number and thereby their actual physical location via linked<br>
databases. In this example, a call-originator exposed to physical danger if identified<br>
as placing a call from an identifiable ALI/ANI data set, may wish to mislead a callreceive<br>
from his true physical location. Similarly, a celebrity may wish to have a<br>
phone number that is not tied to a true physical location, or and so<br>
As a consequence, presently known systems and methods for placing calls,<br>
particularly long distance calls, include at least one of the following detriments:<br>
1. Variation in cost between local and long distance calls. Such<br>
variation in costs is deleterious to both personal and business<br>
financial planning.<br>
2. Variation in cost during a single call.<br>
a. For example, under certain plans, a long distance call begun<br>
before O5:59pm may be charged at a first rate/minute, while the<br>
remaining portion of the call (after 06:00pm) is charged at a<br>
second rate/minute.<br>
3. Imposition of local, state and other jurisdiction taxes.<br>
4. Imposition of variable fee surcharges.<br>
5. Inability to block originating call location and address information.<br>
6. Inability to disguise an originating call number or location.<br>
7. Inability to select a preferred originating call number that is not<br>
otherwise geographically available.<br>
8. Inability to select a preferred originating call number that promotes a<br>
marketing goal.<br>
Therefore it is recognized that a need exists for a method, system, or an<br>
apparatus that is capable of responding to at least one of the detriments noted above.<br>
OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a method, system, or<br>
apparatus that responds to at least one of the needs noted above.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide an a method or system<br>
that enables a reduction in call charges for placing a long distance call based on a<br>
virtual phone number.<br>
In one alternative aspect, the present invention broadly relates to a system for<br>
transmitting information between at least two points, comprising: a first intermediate<br>
point operatively connected to at least one originating point to receive a virtual<br>
identifier, wherein the virtual identifier is convertible into at least one physical<br>
number, a second intermediate point capable of communicating with the first<br>
intermediate point over a computer network, at least one destination point<br>
operatively connected to the second intermediate point, wherein the second<br>
intermediate point is selectably determined based on its proximity to the at least one<br>
destination point.<br>
In another alternative aspect, the present invention optionally relates to a<br>
method for transmitting information between two or more points, comprising the<br>
steps of:: receiving a virtual number at a first intermediate point from at least one<br>
originating point, converting the received virtual number into at least one physical<br>
number, determining a second intermediate point based on the at least one physical<br>
number, determining at least one destination point based on the at least one physical<br>
number, and transmitting information between the at least one originating point and<br>
the at least one destination point.<br>
According to an alternative embodiment of the present invention there is<br>
provided a method for transmitting information between two or more points. The<br>
information that is received can be, for example, a telephone call. The method<br>
comprises at least one step of receiving a virtual number from at least one point on<br>
an originating network at a first intermediate point on a computer network. Then,<br>
based on the virtual number, and other factors described, at least a second<br>
intermediate point on the computer network is determined. The first and second<br>
intermediate points are preferably capable of communicating over the computer<br>
network.<br>
Once the second intermediate point is determined, a connection is established<br>
between the second intermediate point and a further point on a destination computer<br>
network, based on information related to the virtual number entered at the<br>
originating network. The first and second intermediate points then enable the point<br>
on the originating network and the point on die destination network to communicate.<br>
This communication, optionally and alternatively, may include steps involving<br>
converting information from the originating and destination networks into a selected<br>
form suitable for ready transmission over the computer network.<br>
In another alternative and adaptive embodiment, the virtual number may<br>
optionally include an area code designation that is within a local calling area of the<br>
designated point on the originating network. The point on the originating network<br>
may optionally be a telephone, but other alternative and adaptive points are<br>
envisioned. For example, the virtual number assigned to the first and second<br>
intermediate points, wherein the first and second intermediate points may be servers,<br>
allow communication between the originating point and the destination point based<br>
on a routing table.<br>
In another alternative and exemplary embodiment of a selected aspect of the<br>
present invention, data is preferably transmitted over a computer network based on<br>
data packets, and data transmitted over at least one of an originating and destination<br>
network is transmitted by analog signals enabling ready interface with historic<br>
telecommunication systems. In another selected exemplary embodiment, and to aid<br>
a communication convenience between an originating user and a destination user, at<br>
least one of the first and second intermediate points is capable of converting analog<br>
signals to digital signals that can be organized into data packets and vice versa.<br>
In another alternative and exemplary embodiment of a selected aspect of the<br>
present invention, the present invention comprises an apparatus or system for<br>
transmitting information between at least two points. The system or apparatus<br>
including at least one point on an originating network that is capable of<br>
communicating with a first intermediate point based on at least one virtual number.<br>
Optionally included, is at least one point on a destination network capable of<br>
communicating with a second intermediate point, based upon the virtual number.<br>
In another alternative and exemplary embodiment of a selected aspect of the<br>
present invention, the selected point on the originating network and the destination<br>
point on the destination network are preferably telecommunication devices<br>
(including, for example, telephones, computers, personal hand-held-devices, and<br>
others), and the first and second intermediate points may be servers or groups of<br>
servers. A computer network is operatively connected between the first and second<br>
servers allowing the telecommunications devices to operatively communicate. The<br>
servers are preferably capable of converting information from the telecommunication<br>
devices into a form conveniently suitable for transmission over the computer<br>
network.<br>
In the embodiment noted above, the virtual number can include, for example<br>
a designated area code that is within the local calling area of the originating<br>
telecommunications device and any additional identifiers usable by a call processing<br>
system to ensure smooth connection. The virtual number assigned to the first and<br>
second servers enables communication between the originating and destination<br>
telecommunication devices (frequently referred to as, but not limited to telephones,<br>
routing systems, etc.). The first and second servers allow this communication based<br>
upon a call routing table or routing data assemblies that are preferably in ready<br>
communication with the selected server.<br>
In another alternative and exemplary embodiment of a selected aspect of the<br>
present invention, data from the telecommunications device (optionally here a<br>
telephone) is transmitted initially as analog signals and is thereafter converted to<br>
digital data transmitted over a computer network based on divisible data packets. As<br>
a consequence, the servers noted herein may, but are not required to, include the<br>
system capacity to convert analog to digital signals and digital to analog signals.<br>
This capacity may also enable the transmission of digital data as data packets. Those<br>
skilled in the art of designing electronic systems should recognize that a conetworked,<br>
but physically separate device or system, may enable this conversioncapacity<br>
and data packet operability without departing from the scope and spirit of<br>
the present invention.<br>
The above, and other objects, features and advantages of the present<br>
invention will become apparent from the following description read in conduction<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
In view of the above, the present invention seeks to remedy at least one of the<br>
needs noted above.<br>
Increasingly, phone companies are using computer networks such as the<br>
Internet, to transport long distance calls from one destination to another.<br>
Transferring voice calls over a data network is typically accomplished by converting<br>
analog human-voice signals into data packets. This is often, but not necessarily<br>
accomplished using an industry system known as Voice-over-Internet-Protocol<br>
(VoIP). Transporting calls over computer networks allows local phone companies to<br>
bypass long distance carriers, and as an additional benefit, because computer<br>
network infrastructures are already in place, the cost of transporting calls over<br>
computer networks is greatly minimized.<br>
Among other aspects, the present invention provides optional methods,<br>
systems, and supporting apparatus for minimizing or managing the costs of long<br>
distance calls by transmitting data (including voice or video related data) over<br>
computer networks. In one embodiment, the present invention provides a method<br>
and apparatus for transmitting voice information between originating and destination<br>
points. The originating and destination points may include, but are not limited to<br>
telecommunication devices including telephones of all types, fax machines, pagers,<br>
computers, two way radios, cellular telephones and telephones operatively connected<br>
to the public switched telephone network (PSTN). In one alternative embodiment,<br>
one of the originating and destination points is a telephone operatively connected to<br>
the PSTN. The originating and destination points are separated such that each<br>
network is operatively connected to its own intermediate point. The two<br>
intermediate points, which are preferably operatively connected by a computer<br>
network, allow the two users (originating and destination) to communication based<br>
on a virtual number assigned to at least one of the users telecommunication devices,<br>
as will be described.<br>
As area code of the virtual number is preferably within a local calling area of<br>
the originating telecommunication device (phone, etc.) In one embodiment<br>
(discussed below); a virtual number is assigned to a destination phone. Using this<br>
system, the assignment information is stored in a memory, and can be readily<br>
referenced to determine which "destination telephone number" (or destination<br>
address) a virtual number is assigned to. Operatively connecting a memory to one or<br>
both of the two intennediate points allows any delay between receiving a<br>
number/address and determining its destination to be minimized.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment, when a virtual number is received by a first<br>
intennediate point, the "call" may be routed from the first intennediate point to a<br>
second intermediate point within the local calling area of the destination telephone.<br>
The second intennediate point then directs the call to the destination telephone. As a<br>
result of one alternative embodiment of the present invention, two intermediate<br>
points can direct a call to any destination number, regardless of the distance between<br>
the two telephones. This benefit allows a user to access (connect to for seeking) a<br>
telephone using only a local virtual phone number despite the physical location of<br>
the destination telephone. As a consequence, one embodiment of the present<br>
invention enables the reduction of cost for a long distance call.<br>
It should be understood, that information may be transmitted on the<br>
originating and destination networks in any manner known to those skilled in the<br>
telecommunications or telephony arts. This may include, but is not limited to,<br>
information in analog, digital, or other format. Additionally, any type of information<br>
may be transmitted between the points of the originating and destination networks.<br>
This may include, but is not limited to voice, data, or facsimile transmissions.<br>
The phrase "routing table", as used broadly herein, may also be adaptively<br>
referred to as a "data table" or a "data assembly" that, as needed, includes a capacity<br>
to keep track of preferred routs by employing a user definable list of steps serving as<br>
treatment instructions for calls, call routing, and selecting supportive routing<br>
precursor steps. See, Newton's Telecom Dictionary, by Harry Newton, 20th Ed.,<br>
CMP Books, March 2004. Routing tables are often contained within a memory<br>
system in an electronic router device, or some other internetworking device, that<br>
keeps track of routs, electronic instructions, and in some cases metrics including<br>
preferences associated with those routs, related to particular network destinations.<br>
The phrase "router" or "router device" as used herein may be understood to<br>
refer broadly to a routing system and a switching device or switch depending upon<br>
the particular context- In a classical understanding a "router system" or "routing<br>
device" may be a simple class 5 switch that direct calls based on incoming<br>
information and preset instructions. In a more complex understanding, a router or<br>
routing system may represent combined hardware and software devices enabling a<br>
connective interface between two "networks" based upon a variable degree of<br>
intelligent programming, including for instance destination addresses, minimum<br>
route distances, operational logic, etc. See, Newton's Telecom Dictionary, by Harry<br>
Newton, 20th Ed., CMP Books, March 2004. For example, in some embodiments, a<br>
selected router system/apparatus may comprise a processor device, such as a<br>
computer, or may be modified to interpret phone numbers and convert voice signals<br>
into data packets. In other adaptive embodiments, a router device may comprise a<br>
stand-alone server or a proxy server, depending upon the related context.<br>
The phrase "telephony" as inclusively used herein refers to the art of<br>
transmitting voice, and optionally data, video, or other signals over a distance greater<br>
"than what can be transmitted by shouting." See, Newton's Telecom Dictionary, by<br>
Harry Newton, 20th Ed., CMP Books, March 2004. The phrase "telephony" is<br>
related to the phrase telecommunications and has been used interchangeably in past<br>
years. Telecommunications has been broadly defined as the art and science of<br>
"communicating" over a distance via the switching of signals (electronic, optical, or<br>
otherwise). See also, Newton's Telecom Dictionary, by Hany Newton, 20* Ed.,<br>
CMP Books, March 2004. Thus, while the present disclosure discusses placing a<br>
voice-call, more is intended, and as used herein the phrases telephony or<br>
telecommunications are not to be interpreted rcstrictively, but instead broadly to<br>
encompass more than just voice communications transferred over a distance.<br>
In one adaptive embodiment of the present invention, two selected routing<br>
devices (routers, switches, etc.) are distributed at differing geographic regions. Each<br>
routing device is operatively connected to a computer system such that they are<br>
capable of communicating with each other. Each of the routing devices may have a<br>
different construction and differing level of sophistication, and each is also<br>
operatively connected to one or more originating or destination networks to receive<br>
and process telephone calls.<br>
Routing systems and devices are broadly included within a "gateway<br>
concept" or simply "gateway," as will be described and facilitate signal transfer as<br>
noted herein. Very broadly, a gateway is an entrance and exit to a communications<br>
network or between two disparate communications networks, and may include<br>
operating software and various hardware constructs working together as a system.<br>
Often a gateway includes some type of signal conditioner to remove unwanted signal<br>
noise and impose controlling characters. Very broadly, a gateway concept describes<br>
a system that connects two or more otherwise incompatible networks. See,<br>
Newton's Telecom Dictionary, by Harry Newton, 20th Ed., CMP Books, March<br>
2004. Thus, gateway constructs, gateway concepts, or gateway systems, particularly<br>
on data networks often perform code or protocol conversions, access data tables,<br>
preset instructions, etc. and generally make communication happen between<br>
otherwise incompatible networks.<br>
One embodiment of a gateway construct is described below as enabling<br>
connection and communication transfer between different networks according to<br>
variable, but understood, communication protocols. Thus, in alternative<br>
embodiments, a routing device within a gateway concept is capable of acting as an<br>
interface between a first and a second network system and may be employed as an<br>
access aid between computer networks. In some cases, a routing device may even<br>
provide a gateway between a conventional central office and a computer network. In<br>
any case, as discussed below, the present embodiment envisions the need to convert<br>
data into a format capable of transmission over one or more computer networks.<br>
In another alternative embodiment of the present invention, a routing device<br>
receives and interprets a virtual number (address) transmitted from an originating<br>
network. After processing a phone number to determine it's further destination, the<br>
routing device connects to another communication device (for example a second<br>
routing device or other gateway device), to connect to a destination network. Once a<br>
connection is established between he originating and destination routers, the<br>
originating router device converts voice data into data packets using a pre-selected<br>
protocol (for example VoIP, or VoP). Preferably, the process of converting the<br>
voice signals into data packets is performed on a real-time, continuous basis. Each<br>
router device can also be capable of converting, the data packets back into voice data<br>
on a real-time, continuous basis. Nothing herein shall constrain the operation of a<br>
routing device, and such a conversion need not be performed by the routing device<br>
and may be performed elsewhere within the communication schemes.<br>
Data conversion on a real-time, continuous basis allows data to be<br>
transmitted between the originating and destination networks, and the computer<br>
network(s) with a substantially minimal amount of delay. This provides the<br>
advantage of allowing the originating and destination users to communication with<br>
substantially minimal audible distortion. This also allows the two users to<br>
communicate over a long distance while minimizing the cost of the call.<br>
Reference will now be made in relative detail to several embodiments of the<br>
invention that are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible,<br>
same or similar reference numerals are used in the drawings and the description to<br>
refer to the same or like parts or steps. The drawings are in simplified form and are<br>
not to precise scale, nor are connections physical but are merely visually<br>
representative for purposes of discuss. For purposes of convenience and clarity only,<br>
directional terms, such as top, bottom, up, down, over, above, and below may be<br>
used with respect to the drawings. These and similar directional terms should aot be<br>
construed to limit the scope of the invention in any manner. The words "connect,"<br>
"couple," and similar terms with their inflectional morphemes do not necessarily<br>
denote direct and immediate connections, but also include connections through<br>
mediate elements or devices.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 1, in one alternative and adaptive embodiment of the<br>
present invention, an outbound VOIP call system 180 begins with a call placed by a<br>
VOEP subscriber employing a VOIP telecommunications device 171.<br>
Telecommunications device 171, is shown as but not limited to a VOIP subscriber<br>
phone 171, and includes an electronic address identifier linked to at least one "Virtual<br>
number" supplied by the VOIP service provider. Here, the address identifier is a<br>
numerical series and may include a known or random key (or keys) associated with a<br>
specific device 171, allowing ready identification by call processing system 161, as<br>
will be discussed. As will be discussed, call processing system 161 includes the<br>
electronic address identifier for device 171.<br>
As will also be later discussed, the VOIP subscriber may acquire one or more<br>
virtual numbers 172 assigned to or electronically linked to that address identifier<br>
within a controlling system linked to device 171. For a first example, a VOIP<br>
subscriber may acquire and link with device 171 a virtual number having a desired<br>
area code for New York City (212-XXX-XXXX), Washington D.C. (703-XXXXXXX),<br>
etc. As will be discussed in more detail below, by acquiring a series of<br>
desired virtual area code numbers each linked with device 171 and call processing<br>
system 161, the VOIP subscriber enables persons making local inbound calls from a<br>
selected area code to experience a local call via the PSTN, and pay only local<br>
charges.<br>
The VOIP subscriber for device 171 may additionally contract with the VOIP<br>
service provider to acquire a virtual toll free (area code 800) number or a customized<br>
virtual fixed-fee line (area code 900) for business or personal reasons. In sum, one<br>
skilled in the telecommunications art should recognize that VOIP subscriber 171<br>
may acquire a wide range of desired "virtual" phone numbers 172, each<br>
electronically linked through internet/computer network 162, with call processing<br>
system 161, via a series of internet broad band lines 163 that service providers<br>
license or otherwise operate with.<br>
As should be additionally understood by those skilled in the art, as depicted<br>
in Fig. 1, VOIP subscriber device 171 is directly linked to continuous computer<br>
network 162 (Internet) for all communication. As a consequence, a local or long<br>
distance connection to the PSTN is unnecessary for device 171. In sum, the present<br>
system or apparatus removes or de-links device 171 from the PSTN, allowing all<br>
communication to occur through Internet broadband lines 163 at substantially lower<br>
costs.<br>
While the present invention envisions broad band lines 163 to be those lines<br>
capable of "high speed" traffic; for example co-axial cable, Cat 5, DSL lines, Fire<br>
Wire, etc, this list is not exclusive, nor is it limited to "physical" lines. It is also<br>
envisioned that broad band lines 163 may be replaced by a wide variety of wireless<br>
connection systems (electromagnetic wave based communication systems) enabling,<br>
for example, device 171 to be a suitably programmed cellular device capable of<br>
wireless communication. In fact, it should be recognized by those skilled in the art<br>
that each communication pathway described herein is merely representative, is not<br>
limited to "physical" lines and may adapt to include alternative communication<br>
technologies as they are developed (for example, cellular technology, wireless<br>
technology, radio frequency technology, etc.)<br>
As described, an outbound call is generated by device 171, and passes<br>
through Internet linked communication pipelines 163, and potentially through one or<br>
more individual transfer nodes (not shown) to call processing system 161. Call<br>
processing system 161 conducts data and organizational mapping to identify a<br>
desired ultimate "real phone" number (or a "virtual phone" number for a second<br>
VOIP subscriber). Call processing system 161 is feature focused, and enables the<br>
subscriber to coordinate how calls may be placed and received. Call processing<br>
system 161 also includes the capacity to receive inbound calls directed to the entire<br>
series of additional numbers 172, and direct those calls to subscriber device 171, as<br>
will be discussed in more detail below.<br>
One principal benefit of the present system, employing call processing<br>
system 161, is that it functions to mask the actual geographic location of device 171,<br>
and mask the "number" of device 171. As a consequence, a subscriber employing<br>
outbound call system 180 places outbound calls using only an electronic "address<br>
identifier" within the call processing system 161, and this may be electronically<br>
crafted to reflect a desired result. Thus, for example, a subscriber located in New<br>
York may place an outbound "call" using device 171 over broadband<br>
communication lines 163 and computer network 162 to reach call processing system<br>
161 that thereafter masks the subscriber's actual location and actual 'Virtual<br>
number" for device 171, by employing any desired identifier.<br>
An "address identifier" as discussed may be "00.010011. . . ." or any other<br>
desired identifier created by the VOIP service provider, and a number of different<br>
"virtual numbers" may be electronically linked to that address identifier within the<br>
computer and data system within call processing system 161.<br>
As discussed herein, a "Virtual number" (broadly meaning a representative<br>
address identifier, typically a series of numbers or symbols) is assigned to an<br>
electronic location and may be, but is not required to be, linked to a geographic<br>
destination within a communication system.<br>
In many ways, a virtual number (virtual phone number) serves as an alias for,<br>
and directs calls to, physical device 171, but the virtual number is not physically<br>
"tied" to device 171. The virtual phone number does not exist, other than as an<br>
address, on an originating or destination network or a physical device as was the<br>
case in the previously described PSTN networks. As a consequence, calls placed to<br>
or from a virtual phone number do not require routing through a physical device on<br>
the originating or destination network, but instead are routed to the virtual number's<br>
mapped addressed identifier linked to device 171. As a consequence the complexity<br>
of call routing is substantially reduced, and costs are similarly minimized. As a<br>
similar consequence, calls directed to virtual number may be automatically directed<br>
to a replacement device 171 or a listed series of devices (not shown) allowing ready<br>
broadcasting of a single call to many devices 171 (for example a single "call" may<br>
be directed to a VOIP phone, a cellular phone, a pager, a PBX, all depending upon<br>
various programmed features).<br>
In another example, here a small business, device 171 maybe a PBX (private<br>
branch exchange) within a building, wherein the PBX includes one or more<br>
additional switches for managing multiple outgoing VOIP based calls. PBX devices<br>
may be simple switches, switch systems, or may be complex computerized<br>
management systems with voice and data transfer systems and a myriad of features,<br>
In either case, "device" 171 has a one ore more address identifier known to call<br>
processing system 161 enabling easy electronic connection.<br>
As the outbound call progresses from device 171 and passes through call<br>
processing system 161 for mapping or directing the outbound call to a desired end<br>
location. Depending upon the mapped "location" for an outbound call made, call<br>
processing system 161 selects a desired broadband connection 163 to direct the<br>
outbound call to a desired end location "physical phone number " 177,167,173 on<br>
the PSTN via a selected gateway concept 174 to a local carrier partner (telephone<br>
company) over a local facility connection system 168 (shown only once) managing<br>
local junctions 165 and the "physical phone number."<br>
Gateway concept 174 and PSTN 175, both labeled local junctions 165, are<br>
collectively to be understood as cooperative systems enabling transmission from<br>
respective lines 163, commonly through a local server (not shown) that receives and<br>
constructs the broadband signal within a selected gateway concept 174 and transmits<br>
the same to the respective linked PSTN 175.<br>
For descriptive purposes, local facility connection systems 168 (only one<br>
shown) as discussed herein broadly includes systems enabling respective local<br>
junctions 165, to receive a broadband signal from call processing system 161, within<br>
gateway concept 174 and retransmit that signal over PSTN 175 to a desired<br>
destination physical number 167,176,173, as shown.<br>
As also shown, a central office 169 (shown only once), is positioned within<br>
connection system 168 at a variable position depending upon a particular location,<br>
electronic and software configuration and design. Despite previous narrower uses,<br>
as used herein "central office" is a very broad and inclusive term used descriptively<br>
to enable receipt of an outbound call, from call processing system 161 and<br>
transmission of that call to physical numbers 167,176,173 via respective subscriber<br>
lines 166. Subscriber lines 166 join physical numbers to a respective central office.<br>
Those skilled in the art should recognize that as used herein central office<br>
169 may be a complex wiring center containing a variety of switching exchanges, a<br>
single switch, or a more complex exchange including broadband receiving servers<br>
and transfer interchanges for linking to the PSTN without departing from the scope<br>
of the present invention or being offensive to common usage. See, Newton's<br>
Telecom Dictionary, by Harry Newton, 20th Ed., CMP Books, March 2004, noting<br>
that "Central Office " is an ambiguous term spanning a single or multiple series of<br>
buildings or physical locations, and a wide range of equipment and functional<br>
aspects, including but not limited to a complex multi-local telecommunications<br>
nexus for an entire region or city.<br>
As a consequence of this diverse range of scope, and for illustrative purposes<br>
only, central office 169 is shown spanning from PSTN 175 to a portion of gateway<br>
concept 174. In one expansive example, central office 169 may include multiple<br>
servers and other devices (not shown) within gateway concept 174, for receiving a<br>
broadband signal via line 163, and interpreting and transporting that signal to various<br>
switches and converter systems (not shown) out to a respective PSTN. In a second<br>
narrower example, central office 169 may be simplified and may not include servers<br>
for receiving signals (the servers would be separately managed within gateway<br>
concepts 174), In this second example, central office 169 would only involve a<br>
respective PSTN 175 and send the outbound signal over subscriber line 166. Thus,<br>
Fig. 1 is to be understood as illustrative only of the concept of enabling an outbound<br>
call from a VOIP device to a long distance "physical number" without the<br>
requirement of paying long distance fees.<br>
Due to the innovative aspects of the present invention, an outbound call from<br>
VOIP device 171 is transmitted via computer network 162 to one or more call<br>
processing systems 161. The outbound call is then routed via Internet broadband<br>
lines 163 to a selected or mapped local facility connection 168 within a local calling<br>
range of a desired physical number 167,173,176.<br>
As also noted, an outbound call may be directed to an international (outside<br>
the US) phone number. Using the present system, call processing system 161<br>
receives the call from device 171, recognizes the international phone number and<br>
directs the call as necessary to an international facility connection 164 for connection<br>
to a local telephone number 177.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, two alternatives exist for transmitting the broadband<br>
signal to international facility connection 164. In a first alternative, call processing<br>
system 161 is informed that international facility connection 164 includes server<br>
capacity to directly receive a broadband signal via a connection with broadband line<br>
163, and as a consequence routs the digital broadband signal directly to international<br>
facility 164 (shown as dashed line joining facility 164 and broadband line 163). As a<br>
consequence, this first alternative enables international facility connection 164 to<br>
receive what seems to be a "local" call via the Internet and its server despite any<br>
geographic distance, and as a result costs are substantially reduced for the call<br>
originator.<br>
In a second alternative, call-processing system 161 is informed that<br>
international facility connection 164 does not include server capacity to directly<br>
receive a broadband signal over internet/computer network broadband lines 163. As<br>
a consequence, in this second alternative embodiment, the outbound call signal is<br>
routed along broadband line 163 to a domestic server in gateway concept 174 at a<br>
domestic facility connection. The outbound call signal is then directed along<br>
common non-broadband lines/conventional telecommunication lines from domestic<br>
gateway concept 174 to international facility 164 (shown as dashed line joining<br>
facility 164 to gateway concept 174. In this manner, the local telecommunication<br>
facility or connection 16S, including gateway concept 174, and "hands off' the<br>
international call using conventional telecommunication call lines or trunk lines.<br>
In either alternative for international access, the outbound long distance call<br>
from device 171 ultimately reaches foreign "real number" 177 without traveling the<br>
conventional telecommunications networks. As result, the present system achieves a<br>
substantial cost savings while enabling call processing system 161 to mask the<br>
originating VOIP address identifier completely, replace it with a selected virtual<br>
number 172, or provide a random identifier.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 2 an inbound call system 181, depicts &amp; call from a<br>
non-VOIP user having a "physical" phone number or a "physical" address 183 to a<br>
VOIP subscriber 193 employing a "virtual number" or series of virtual numbers<br>
similar to virtual numbers 172 shown previously in Fig. 1, and discussed above.<br>
As an inbound caJl is made from physical number 182, the call passes over<br>
subscriber line 184 to the PSTN 185 as a local call for connection to broader<br>
gateway concept 182A. As discussed above, gateway concept 182A includes a<br>
capacity to receive and transmit data over a series of broadband connections between<br>
call processing system 191 and PSTN 185, as shown. While a the broad operation of<br>
a gateway concept was discussed above, and is again incorporated herein, the<br>
functionality of the gateway concept is the guiding factor, namely enabling a<br>
connection from a physical number 183 or subscriber line 184 on the PSTN 185, to<br>
call processing system 191.<br>
In the present embodiment, gateway concept 182A includes a central office<br>
186 visualized as connecting a local server 188 via lines 187 to switches within<br>
central office 186. As discussed, local server 188 enables receipt, transmission, and<br>
retransmission of packetized data 189 over Internet connections/computer networks<br>
190, 192 in a manner well know to those skilled in the arts of digital transfer. As<br>
suggested above, it is additionally envisioned, that one optional system construction<br>
incorporates local server 188 within an expansively understood central office 186,<br>
allowing central office 186 to now interact directly between Internet 190 and PSTN<br>
185.<br>
In the present embodiment, VOIP device 193 is assigned a virtual number as<br>
an address identifier (for example a New York City phone number 212-XXXXXXX)<br>
by a VOIP service provider (not shown). This virtual number is known to<br>
call processing system 191, which enables inbound calls received from computer<br>
network 190 to be mapped directly to virtual number 193. It will be recognized, that<br>
the actual physical location of VOIP device 193 may be anywhere, including a local<br>
geographically distant from New York City.<br>
Here, an inbound caller, calling from a physical number 183 for example<br>
located within a local-call-region of the virtual number, makes only a local call over<br>
subscriber line 184 to the local PSTN 185 (for example area code (212)) and hence<br>
incurs only local call charges for calling device 193 however geographically distant.<br>
After receiving the physical call from number 183 and local PSTN, the<br>
gateway concept 182A enables the local telecommunications company to convert the<br>
physical number into data and transmit it to call processing system 191, where the<br>
digitized number is mapped to the address identifier for VOIP device 193.<br>
In this manner, broadly an inbound call may be made using any of a series of<br>
virtual numbers assigned to a VOIP subscriber, most conveniently and cheaply by<br>
selecting a local-call virtual number. The call is linked through a common series of<br>
class 4 or class 5 switches with gateway concept 182A, where the real physical<br>
number is converted to an identifier identified with the call-receiver's VOIP service<br>
provider and transmitted to call processing system 191. Call processing system 191<br>
links this digital identifier to the VOIP subscriber/customer and the list of VOIP<br>
customer address identifiers and transmits the digital call to device 193. As a<br>
consequence, a local call made from a "physical" number incurs only local phone<br>
charges and may reach a VOIP subscriber's addressed device anywhere in the world<br>
(either "local" or "long distance")<br>
Referring now to Fig. 3, a communications system 194 describes a<br>
communication pathway between a first VOIP subscriber's device 199 to a second<br>
VOIP subscriber's device 199A, wherein the VOIP service provided to each device<br>
originates from different providers operating different protocols and addressing<br>
identifying formats.<br>
In this system, as discussed earlier, a call is made from device 199 through<br>
computer network 198 to a first service provider's call processing system 197, and<br>
thereafter employs a gateway concept 196 to reach the PSTN 195. The call is then<br>
directed from PSTN 195 through a second gateway concept 196A to the second<br>
service provider's call processing system 197 over computer network 198A and<br>
finally to VOIP device 199A.<br>
This present system allows low cost and reasonably effective transmission<br>
between devices 199, 199A, but still requires the use of the telecommunications<br>
industry PSTN 195 as an interface. As a consequence, communications system 194<br>
enables the beneficial use of a variety of "virtual numbers" for vanity, business, or<br>
other reasons and also eliminates long distance call charges.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 4, an alternative and adaptive communications system<br>
200 removes the PSTN requirement noted in Fig. 1, and allows a session border<br>
controller 202 to convert diverse protocols from different VOIP provider's call<br>
processing centers 201, 201'. For example, a first call originator using virtual phone<br>
numbers and device 205 accesses first call processing center 201 using computer<br>
network 203. First call processing center 201 employs SEP (session initiation<br>
protocols), one of the emerging standards for setting up telecommunications,<br>
particularly real-time communications over the Internet. Second call processing<br>
center 201' employs a second non-similar protocol (HTTP - hypertext transfer<br>
protocol, HTTPS - hypertext transfer protocol secure, etc.). As a consequence,<br>
session border controller 202 includes a capacity to convert one service provider's<br>
protocol into another protocol without unduly slowing a call transmission and<br>
increasing costs. This solution, the use of a session border controller 202 enabling<br>
protocol conversions protects computer networks 203, 204, and call processing<br>
centers 201,201', while enabling all the benefits noted above.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 5, an exemplary system according to another<br>
alternative embodiment of the present invention includes a user 101 placing a call to<br>
a user 103 employing VOIP. As noted, user 101 dials a "virtual number" assigned to<br>
user 103 (for example number 202-424-XXXX), which is a local call for user 101<br>
The call accesses a routing device or routing system 105 that accesses a routing data<br>
assembly 107 to understand where and how to respond to the "virtual number"<br>
assigned to user 103. As shown, a decision is made to access telecommunications<br>
network 111, where network 111 often employs a computer network to access<br>
multiple connections based on addressed routing information including the address<br>
identifier for user 103 and routing device 109. As noted, routing device 105 may<br>
include a complete routing system or series of communications elements depending<br>
upon design. Once routing information is obtained<br>
When information i$ provided to routing device 109, routing device 109<br>
accesses a routing data assembly 113 to confirm the identity and "address identifier"<br>
of user 103 and enables a direct connection to user 103.<br>
In one unusual situation, user 103 physically moves their connection to<br>
computer network 111 to a new physical location 160. For example, user 103 moves<br>
from Seattle to Paris, thereby employing a different network access portal. When<br>
user 103, now shown in location 160 as user 103', reconnects to computer network<br>
111, a new "address location" is created at a call processing center (not shown) for<br>
connecting device or system 109'. In this system, routing device 105 transfers a call<br>
through network 111 to router 109. When the call is transferred from device 105 to<br>
device 109, the virtual numbers of their equivalents are included in the transmitted<br>
information. When the call reaches device 109, device communicates with database<br>
113 to determine a preferred address the virtual number is assigned to. Based on this<br>
communication, device 109 determines that the destination number is, for example<br>
732-528-XXXX, which corresponds to user 103. A connection is then established<br>
between device 109 and user 103. This connection may include, but is not limited to<br>
a connection via selected internet protocols. Once this connection is established,<br>
users 101 and 103 may communicate without incurring typical long distance<br>
charges. Employing this system, user 103 may transport their VOIP device<br>
geographically to new location 160 and employ all the unique benefits noted above.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 6, a diagram showing an exemplary embodiment of<br>
one alternative aspect of the present invention enables multiple virtual numbers,<br>
commonly local area call phone numbers, to reach a geographically distant location<br>
at local calling prices. As shown, a plurality of multiple virtual numbers 201,150<br>
may be assigned to a virtual address identifier 152 for a VOIP subscriber 103 having<br>
a connection to the Internet via connecting network and routing device 109. In<br>
conjunction with the understanding from Fig. 5, each routing device may be<br>
accessed using a plurality of known virtual numbers. Each virtual number<br>
preferably allowing an originating user (for example user 101) to dial a number<br>
within their local area code to access a designated destination user 103, 103.' As<br>
shown in Fig. 6, multiple users may communication, simultaneously or<br>
independently, with user 103 via device 109 which may be configured to receive<br>
virtual calls from a plurality of lines 201,150 and rout each one to address identifier<br>
152.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 7, in another exemplary embodiment of the present<br>
invention, one or more virtual numbers may be assigned to multiple physical<br>
numbers 301. In other words, a virtual number may be used to call more than one<br>
physical number 301, individually or simultaneously. These calls may be directed to<br>
assigned physical numbers 301 (numbers 155, 156, 157) in any desired manner,<br>
either individually in series, or broadcast in parallel.<br>
In one example, a virtual number 303 may be assigned such that server<br>
device or routing device 109 rings physical devices 301 all at once, or one at a time.<br>
Information regarding the order, sequence, timing, and other preferences relating to<br>
call routing may be stored in data assembly described as data system 113.<br>
In another example, if all of the devices ring at the same time, the call is<br>
routed to the number that answers first, if each number rings one at a time, a user<br>
103 has the option of rolling the call to the next number in a random or pre-selected<br>
order. For example, where user 30] employs a virtual number 157 to a VOIP<br>
device, a physical pager number 156, and a cellular number 155, each may be rung<br>
simultaneously or in a selected order, according to user preferences.<br>
One convenient aspect of the present invention is understood when a virtual<br>
number, assigned to a specific physical device (VOIP device, cellular, pager, real<br>
phone, computer, etc.) via a call processing system is easily changed upon a user's<br>
request. This type of "re-addressing" may be done quickly with minimal effort via<br>
simple Internet based programming or voice command.<br>
In sum, the present embodiments and inventions noted above respond to at<br>
least one of the needs earlier noted by providing at least one solution to making a<br>
long distance call, or any call linked with a virtual number at a. substantially lower<br>
cost by minimizing or avoiding several of the steps provided by the existing PSTN<br>
network.<br>
As an additional benefit, the present invention discloses the capacity to<br>
broadcast calls to multiple devices in a pre-selected manner, and in other<br>
embodiments to receive multiple calls directed to a single address identifier<br>
simultaneously or in a selected priority.<br>
In the claims, means- or step-plus-function clauses are intended to cover the<br>
structures described or suggested herein as performing the recited function and not<br>
only structural equivalents but also equivalent structures. Thus, for example,<br>
although a nail, a screw, and a bolt may not be structural equivalents in that a nail<br>
relies on friction between a wooden part and a cylindrical surface, a screw's helical<br>
surface positively engages the wooden part, and a bolt's head and nut compress<br>
opposite sides of a wooden part, in the environment of fastening wooden parts, a<br>
nail, a screw, and a bolt may be readily understood by those skilled in the art as<br>
equivalent structures.<br>
Having described at least one of the preferred embodiments of the present<br>
invention with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be understood that<br>
the invention is not limited to those precise embodiments, and that various changes,<br>
modifications, and adaptations may be effected therein by one skilled in the art<br>
without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention as defined in the<br>

one destination point further comprises the step of establishing a<br>
communication path between the at least one destination point and the<br>
second intermediate point.<br>
6. A system for transmitting information between at least two points,<br>
comprising:<br>
a first intermediate point operatively connected to at least one<br>
originating point to receive a virtual identifier, wherein the virtual identifier<br>
is converted into at least one physical number;<br>
a second intermediate point capable of communicating with the fust<br>
intermediate point over a computer network;<br>
at least one destination point operatively connected to the second,<br>
intermediate point, wherein the second intermediate point is determined<br>
based on its proximity to the at least one destination point.<br>
7. The system according to claim 6, wherein the virtual identifier comprises an<br>
area code identifer, wherein the area code is within a local calling area of the at<br>
least one originating point.<br>
8 The system according to claim 6, wherein information is transmitted over the<br>
computer network based on packets.<br>
9 The system according to claim 6, wherein information is transmitted to and<br>
from the originating and destination points based on analog signals.<br>
