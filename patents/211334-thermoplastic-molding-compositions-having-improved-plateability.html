"THERMOPLASTIC    MOLDING    COMPOSITIONS    HAVING    IMPROVED PLATEABILITY"<br>
BAYER CORPORATION,  of  100 Bayer Road,  Pittsburgh,  Pennsylvania 15205, United States of America,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br>
GRANTED<br>

THERMOPLASTIC MOLDING COMPOSITIONS HAVING IMPROVED PLATEABILITY<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention is ducted to A uv^moplasilc maiding composition, which contains ABS and polycarbonate and to articles molded therefrom, and more particularly to metal plated articles molded therefrom.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
A thermoplastic molding composition containing a major amount of polycarbonate and a lesser amount of butadiene based graft polymer is disclosed. The inventive composition is especially suited for the preparation of a molded article wherein at least some of its surface is metallized by #n electroless plating process. The thus plated article is characterized in its improved heat resistance and excellent adhesion of its<br>
metal plating.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Thermoplastic molding composition containing polycarbonates and ABS polymers have been known for some time, see for example DE-A 1 170 141 which describes the favorable processing properties of such molding compositions. Also relevant are U.S. Patents 3,130,177, 3,162,695 and 3,852,393 and British Patent No   1,253,226.<br>
Also known are thermoplastic molding compositions containing polycarbonate and acrylate based plating modifiers (U.S. Patent 4,828,921) or ABS which are suitable for electroless metal plating.  In general, the polycarbonate content in these compositions is kept low as it has long been recognized that the presence of polycarbonate in relatively high amounts is the cause of difficulties in electroless metal-plating (see U.S. Patents 5,198,096 and 5,087,524). On the other hand, the heat resistance of the composition is directly related to the polycarbonate level. Blends containing a higher content of polycarbonate feature better thermal<br><br>
performance. The art has long sought a molding composition that would combine good heat resistance with good plating characteristics. The composition of the present invention addresses this goal. Special procc-aes i"r electroless plating of polycarbonate have been described in U.S. Patents 5,087,524 and 5,198,096.<br>
Processes for electroless plating have been disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,125,649 and in the Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and Technology, Vol. 8, both incorporated by reference herein.<br>

average particle diameter (d50 value) of 0.05 to 0.5 microns.<br>
	The first graft polymer of the inventive composition is well known in<br>
the art and is commercially available. A general description of such graft polymers is included in "Methoden der Organischen Chemie" (Houben Weyl), Vol. 14/1, Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart 1961, pages 393-406 and in C. B. Bucknall, "Toughened Plastics", Appl. Science Publishers,      London, 1977, incorporated herein by reference. Suitable graft polymers have been disclosed in U.S. Patents 3,564,077; 3,644,574 and 3,919,353, which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Particularly preferred first graft polymers C may be obtainable by grafting of at least one (meth)acrylate and/or acrylonitrile and/or styrene as the first grafted phase onto a first graft base containing butadiene polymer having a gel content of at least 50% by weight (as measured in toluene), the degree of grafting (the degree of grafting is the weight ratio of graft monomers grafted on to the graft base and the monomers which were not grafted and is dimc-nsionless) being between 0.15 and 10. In addition to butadiene units, the graft base may contain up to 50% by weight, based on the weight of the butadiene units, of other ethylenically unsaturated monomers, such as styrene, acrylonitrile, esters of acrylic or methacrylic acid containing 1 to 4 carbon atoms in the alcohol component (such as methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate), vinyl esters and/or vinyl ethers The preferred graft base contains only polybutadiene.<br>
Since the graft monomers do not have to be completely grafted onto the graft base in the grafting reaction, the first graft polymer C in the context of the invention is also understood to include products which are obtained by polymerization of the graft monomers in the presence of the graft base.<br><br>
The average particle sizes (d 50) is the diameter above which 50%<br>
by weight of the particles and below which 50% by weight of the particles<br>
lie. It may be determined by uitracentrifuge measurement (W. Scholtan, H.<br>
Lange, Kolloid Z. und Z. Polymere 250 (1972), 782-796).<br>
The gel content of the graft base may be determined in dimethyl<br>
formamide. (M. Hoffmann, H. Kromer, R. Kuhn, Polymeranalytik I und II,<br>
Georg Thieme-Verlag. Stuttgart, 1977).<br>
The first graft polymer may be produced by known methods, such<br>
as bulk, suspension, emulsion or bulk suspension polymerization,<br>
preferably by emulsion polymerization.<br>
The average particle size (d 50) of the first graft polymer component<br>
C of the present invention is about 0.05 to 0.5 microns, preferably 0.1 to<br>
0.4 microns.<br>
Component D<br>
Component D, a second graft polymer is present in an amount of 1<br>
to 15 parts by weight.<br>
It contains 78 to 95 percent of a graft phase D. 1 and 5 to 22 percent<br>
of a graft base D.2, the percents being relative to the weight of the second<br>
graft polymer. The graft phase D.1 comprise<br>
D. 1.1   65 to 85 percent relative to the weight or the graft phase of at least one member selected from the group consisting of styrene. alpha-methyl styrene, nucleus-substituted styrene, Ci,8 alky! methacrylate and C,.s aikvl acrylate, and<br>
D. 1.2   15 to 35 percent relative to the weight of the graft phase of at least one member selected from the group consisting of acrylonitrile, methacryionitrile, C,.8 alkyl methacrylate, Ci-s alkyl acrylate. maleic anhydride. C1-4 alkyl substituted maleic imide and phenyl-N-substituted maleic imide.<br>
and where said second graft base comprise a non-crosslinked elastomer<br>
selected from the group consisting of polybutadiene and copolymers of<br>
butadiene with at least one member selected from the group consisting of<br>
styrene, isoprene and C4-8 alkyl acrylate having a weight average<br><br>
molecular weight of 50,000 to 250,000 g/mole and where the second graft polymer has a weight,average particle diameter of 0.6 to 20 microns;<br>
in a preferred embodiment, the graft phase contains 80 to 94 percent of D. 1.1 and 6 to 20 percent of D.1.2. In a further preferred embodiment, the graft base D.2 is present at an amount of 8 to 18 percent relative to the weight of the second graft polymer.<br>
The second graft polymer of the invention, Component D, is largely similar to component C with a few important differences as these are noted above. This second graft polymer is also well known in the art and is commercially available. This graft has been extensively described in the literature, for instance in, "Methoden der Organischen Chemie" (HouDenWeyl), Vol. 14/1, Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart, 1961, which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Particularly preferred second graft polymer D may be obtainable by grafting of at least one (meth)acrylate and/or acrylonitrile and/or styrene as the grafted phase onto a graft base containing butadiene polymer. In addition to butadiene units, the graft base of Component D may contain up to 50% by weight, based on the weight of the butadiene units, of other etnylenically unsaturated monomers, such as styrene, isoprene or C4_g alkyl acrylate. The preferred graft base contains only polybutadiene or poly (butadiene-styrene) copolymer.<br>
Since the graft monomers do not have to be completely grafted onto the graft base in the grafting reaction, the graft polymer D is also understood to include products which are obtained by polymerization of the graft monomers in the presence of the graft base<br>
The weight average particle size of the second graft polymer, component D, of the present invention is about 0.6 to 20.0 microns, preferably 0.6 to 5 microns, most preferably 0.6 to 1.6 microns<br>
The second graft polymer may be produced by known methods, such as suspension, bulk or mass graft polymerization. A preferred method entails mass or suspension graft polymerization of the<br><br>
comonomers of the grafted phase, for instance, styrene and acrylonitrile, in the presence of polybutadiene.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, Component D contains 10 to 16% by weight of graft base, which contains only polybutadiene. The weight average molecular weight (GPC) of the free SAN in the styrene/-acrylonitrile graft polymer is in the range from 50,000 to 150,000 and the crafted polybuta j"-ne has a weigh- average partic: ; ;ize in the rang^ A from 0.6 to 1.6 microns. Component E<br>
Component E of the inventive composition is a wax which melts below 400 °C Waxes suitable in the practice are well known and are available in commerce. Chemically, these are compounds which are esters of a high molecular weight fatty acid with a high molecular weight alcohol, including mixtures of such esters. The molecular weight, weight average, or, where applicable, formula of the suitable waxes is in the range of 300 to 5000 g/mole. The alcohol component of the ester group is selected from among aliphatic, linear or branched, mono, bi-, or polyfunctional alcohols with more than two carbon atoms, preferably 3 to 22 carbon atoms, the acid component being mono-, di-, or polyfunctional aliphatic acids with more than 3 carbon atoms, preferred more than 5 carbon atoms. These compounds are known and are widely used as additives to polymeric molding compositions for their release function. Preferred compounds are the reaction products of C4 to C8 alcohols and C1-8 to C1-8 acids. Examples of preferred type esters are butylstearate, butyladipate and dioctyladipate.<br>
Component E is present in the inventive composition in an amount of 0.1 to 4 parts per 100 resin of the total of A, B, C and D.<br>
In addition, the composition of the invention may advantageously contain other additives such as plasticizers, antioxidants, plating additives. silicone oil, stabilizers, flame-retardants, fibers, mineral fibers, mineral fillers, dyes, pigments and the like.<br><br>
The preparation of the inventive composition follows conventional procedures which are well known in the art. Usually, however, they are extrusion blended or compounded in a high intensity blender such as a Banbury Mixer or twin-screw extruder.<br>
The invention is now described with reference to the following examples which aie for the purples  onlv and are not intended to imply any limitation on the scope of the invention.<br>
EXAMPLES COMPONENTS USED:<br>
Polycarbonate - A linear polycarbonate based on bisphenol A having a meit viscosity of 4.5 grams per 10 minutes at 300°C with 1.2 kg load;ASTMD 1238.<br>
ABS-1 and ABS-2 - prepared by the graft emulsion polymerization of styrene and acrylonitrile in a weight ratio of S/AN of about 70:30 in the presence of polybutadiene. ABS-1 and ABS-2 contained, respectively, 60 and 38 percent by weight of polybutadiene. The weight average molecular weights of the ungrafted SAN polymer fraction (GPC per ASTM Method D 3536-76) were respectively 80,000 and 100,000 g/mole. The ABS poiymer is recovered from the emulsion by conventional coagulation, filtration and washing    The grafted polybutadiene has an average particle size of 0.3 to 0.2 micrometer measured as a d50 value measured by Photon Correlation Spectroscopy using a Brookhaven Instrument Company BI-90 Particle Size.<br>
ABS-3 — prepared by the graft suspension polymerization of styrene and acrylonitrile in a weight ratio of 72:28 in the presence of polybutadiene.<br>
ABS-3 contains 14% by weight of polybutadiene. The weight average molecular weight determined by GPC of the free SAN in the styrene/acrylonitrile graft polymer was 110,000 g/mole and the grafted polybutadiene had an average particle size of 0.8 microns<br><br>
SAN-1 — a copolymer of styrene and acrylonitrile made by continous   polymerization. The copolymer contains 75.5 weight % styrene and 24.5 weight % ac"vlcnitrile.<br>
Each of the exemplified compositions contained 0.2 parts of butyl stearate per 100 resin of the total of A, B, C and D.<br>
An extrusion process physically blended the components of the polymer blends of each example This was carried out in a 34 mm Leistritz twin-screw extruder (24:1 L:D screw; 250 revolutions per minute; at 260° C). A commercial antioxidant having no criticality in the present context was included in the compositional makeup at a level of 0.1% by weight. The die temperature was 260°C. The extruded material is passed through a water bath and peiletized<br>
The peiletized material is then injection molded into specimens for testing.<br>
Electroless plating was carried out by the process described below : Specimens tested for peel strength were prepared in the following manner:<br>
Chromic Acid/Sulfuric Acid Etching—10 minutes at 68°C<br>
Dead Rinse	1 minute<br>
