Field of in)ention<br>
The present in)ention relates to compounds mat are inhibitors of the 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase Type 1 enzyme. The present in)ention further relates to the use of inhibitors of 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase Type 1 enzyme for the treatment of non-insulin dependent type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, obesity, lipid disorders, metabolic syndrome and other diseases and conditions that are mediated by excessi)e glucocorticoid action.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Insulin is a hormone that modulates glucose and lipid metabolism. Impaired action of insulin (i.e., insulin resistance) results in reduced insulin-induced glucose uptake, oxidation and storage, reduced insulin-dependent suppression of fatty acid release from adipose tissue (i.e., lipolysis) and reduced insulin-mediated suppression of hepatic glucose production and secretion. Insulin resistance frequently occurs in diseases that lead to increased and premature morbidity and mortality.<br>
Diabetes mellitus is characterized by an ele)ation of plasma glucose le)els (hyperglycemia) in the fasting state or after administration of glucose during a glucose tolerance test "While this disease may be caused by se)eral underlying factors, it is generally grouped into two categories, Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes, also referred to as Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ("IDDM"), is caused by a reduction of production and secretion of insulin. In type 2 diabetes, also referred to as non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, or NIDDM, insulin resistance is a significant pathogenic factor in the de)elopment of hyperglycemia. Typically, the insulin le)els in type 2 diabetes patients are ele)ated (i.e., hyperinsulinemia), but mis compensatory increase is not sufficient to o)ercome the insulin resistance. Persistent or uncontrolled hyperglycemia in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus is associated with increased incidence of macro)ascular and/or micro)ascular<br>
effects.<br>
Glitazones (i.e., 5-benzylthiazolidine-2,4-diones) are a newer class of compounds used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. These agents may reduce insulin resistance in multiple tissues, thus lowering blood glucose. The risk of hypoglycemia may also be a)oided. Glitazones modify the acti)ity of the Peroxisome Proliferator Acti)ated Receptor ("PPAR") gamma subtype. PPAR is currently belie)ed to be the primary therapeutic target for the main mechanism of action for the beneficial effects of these compounds. Other modulators of the PPAR family of proteins are currently in de)elopment for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and/or dyslipidemia. Marketed glitazones suffer from side effects including bodyweight gain and peripheral edema.<br>
Additional treatments to normalize blood glucose le)els in patients with diabetes mellitus are needed. Other therapeutic strategies are being explored. For example, research is being conducted concerning Glucagon-Like Peptide 1 ("GLP-1") analogues and inhibitors of Dipeptidyl Peptidase I) ("DPP-I)") that increase insulin secretion. Other examples include: Inhibitors of key enzymes in)ol)ed in the hepatic glucose production and secretion (e.g., Eructose-l,6-bisphosphatase inhibitors) and direct modulation of enzymes in)ol)ed in insulin signaling (e.g., Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase-lB, or "FTP-IB").<br>
Another method of treating or prophylactically treating diabetes mellitus includes using inhibitors of 11-p-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase Type 1 (1 Ip-HSDl). Such methods are discussed in J.R. Seckl et al., Endocrinology, 142: 1371-1376,2001 and references cited therein. Glucocorticoids are steroid hormones that are potent regulators of glucose and lipid metabolism. Excessi)e glucocorticoid action may lead to insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, increased abdominal obesity and hypertension. Glucocorticoids circulate in the blood in an acti)e form (i.e., cortisol in humans) and an inacti)e form (i.e., cortisone in humans). 11P-HSD1, which is highly expressed in li)er and adipose tissue, con)erts cortisone to cortisol leading to higher local concentration of cortisol. Inhibition of 1 Ip-HSDl pre)ents or decreases the tissue specific amplification of glucocorticoid action thus imparting beneficial effects on blood pressure and glucose- and lipid-metabolism.<br>
Thus, inhibiting 1 Ip-HSDl benefits patients suffering from non-insulin dependent type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, obesity, lipid disorders, metabolic syndrome and other diseases and conditions mediated by excessi)e glucocorticoid action.<br>
complications including atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, peripheral )ascular disease, stroke, nephropathy, neuropathy and retinopathy.<br>
TnsuHn resistance, e)en in the absence of profound hyperglycemia, is a component of the metabolic syndrome. Recently, diagnostic criteria for metabolic syndrome ha)e been established. To qualify a patient as ha)ing metabolic syndrome, three out of the fi)e following criteria must be met: ele)ated blood pressure abo)e 130/85 mmHg, fasting blood glucose abo)e 110 mg/dl, abdominal obesity abo)e 40" (men) or 35" (women) waist circumference and blood lipid changes as defined by an increase in triglycerides abo)e 150 mg/dl or decreased HDL cholesterol below 40 mg/dl (men) or 50 mg/dl (women). It is currently estimated that 50 million adults, in the US alone, fulfill these criteria. That population, whether or not they de)elop o)ert diabetes mellitus, are at increased risk of de)eloping the macro)ascular and micro)ascular complications of type 2 diabetes listed abo)e.<br>
A)ailable treatments for type 2 diabetes ha)e recognized limitations. Diet and physical exercise can ha)e profound beneficial effects hi type 2 diabetes patients, but compliance is poor. E)en in patients ha)ing good compliance, other forms of therapy may be required to further impro)e glucose and h'pid metabolism.<br>
One therapeutic strategy is to increase insuun le)els to o)ercome insulin resistance. This may be achie)ed through direct injection of insulin or through stimulation of the endogenous insulin secretion hi pancreatic beta cells. Sulfonylureas (e.g., tolbutamide and glipizide) or meglitinide are examples of drugs that stimulate insulin secretion (i.e., insuun secretagogues) thereby increasing circulating insulin concentrations high enough to stimulate insulin-resistant tissue. Howe)er, insulin and insulin secretagogues may lead to dangerously low glucose concentrations (i.e., hypoglycemia). In addition, insulin secretagogues frequently lose therapeutic potency o)er time.<br>
Two biguanides, metformin and phenformin, may impro)e insulin sensiti)ity and glucose metabolism hi diabetic patients. Howe)er, the mechanism of action is not well understood. Both compounds may lead to lactic acidosis and gastrointestinal side effects (e.g., nausea or diarrhea).<br>
Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (e.g., acarbose) may delay carbohydrate absorption from the gut after meals, which may hi turn lower blood glucose le)els, particularly in the postprandial period. Like biguanides, these compounds may also cause gastrointestinal side<br>

Biological Data: Measurement of Inhibition Constants;<br>
The ability of test compounds to inhibit human llp-HSD-1 enzymatic acti)ity in )itro was e)aluated in a Scintillation Proximity Assay (SPA). Tritiated-cortisone substrate, NADPH cofactor and titrated compound were incubated with truncated human 1 lp-HSD-1 enzyme (24-287AA) at room temperature to allow the con)ersion to cortisol to occur. The reaction was stopped by adding a non-specific 11 p)HSD inhibitor, l'8p-glycyrrhetinic acid. The tritiated cortisol was captured by a mixture of an anti-cortisol monoclonal antibody and SPA beads'coated with anti-mouse antibodies. The reaction plate was shaken at room temperature and the radioacti)ity bound to SPA beads was then measured on a p-scintillation counter. The 11-PHSD-1 assay was carried out in 96-well microtiter plates in a total )olume of 220 pi To start the assay, 188 pi of master mix which contained 17.5 nM 3H-cortisone, 157.5 nM cortisone and 181 mM NADPH was added to the wells. In order to dri)e the reaction in the forward direction, 1 mM G-6-P was also added. Solid compound was dissol)ed in DMSO to make a 10 mM stock followed by a subsequent 10-fold dilution with 3% DMSO in Tris/EDTA buffer (pH 7.4). 22 p.1 of titrated compounds was then added in triplicate to the substrate. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 10 pi of O.lmg/ml E.coli lysates o)erexpressing llp-HSD-1 enzyme. After shaking and incubating plates for 30 minutes at room temperature, reactions were stopped by adding 10 pi of 1 mM glycyrrhetinic acid. The product, tritiated cortisol, was captured by adding 10 pi of 1 pM monoclonal anti-cortisol antibodies and 100 ul SPA beads coated with anti-mouse antibodies. After shaking for 30 minutes, plates were read on a liquid scintillation counter Topcount. Percent inhibition was calculated based on the background and the maximal signal. Wells that contained substrate without compound or enzyme were used as the background, while the wells that contained substrate and enzyme without any compound were considered as maximal signal. Percent of inhibition of each compound was calculated relati)e to the maximal signal and IC50 cur)es were generated. This assay was applied to 1 lp-HSD-2 as well, whereby tritiated cortisol and NAD* were used as substrate and cofactor, respecti)ely.<br>

Metabolic Stability Incubation conditions:<br>
Metabolic stability screen: each substrate (10 uM) was incubated with microsomal protein (0.1 - 0.5 mg/ml) in 50mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) in 48-Well plate. The enzyme reaction was initiated by the addition of ImM NADPH, then incubated at 37°C in a Forma Scientific incubator (Marietta, OH, USA) with gentle shaking. The reactions were quenched by the addition of 800 ul of ACN/MeOH (1:1, )/)), containing 0.5 pM of internal standard (IS), after 30 min incubation. Samples were then filtered by using Capti)a 96-Well Filtration ()arian, Lake Forest, CA, USA) and analyzed by LC/MS (mass spectrometry). Li)er microsomal incubations were conducted in duplicate. LC/MS analysis:<br>
The parent remaining in the incubation mixture was determined by LC/MS. The LC/MS system consisted of an Agilent 1100 series (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany) and API 2000 (MDS SCffiX, Ontario, Canada). A Luna C8(2) (50 x 2.0 mm, particle size 3 jam, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) was used to quantify each compound at ambient temperature. The mobile phase consisted of (A): 10 mM NELAC (pH 3.3) and (B): 100% ACN and was deli)ered at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. Elution was achie)ed using a linear gradient of 0-100% B o)er 3 min, then held 100% B for 4 min and returned to 100% A in 1 min. The column was equilibrated for 7 min before the next injection.<br>
The peak area ratios (each substrate o)er IS) at each incubation time were expressed as the percentage of the ratios (each substrate o)er IS) of the control samples (0 min incubation). The parent remaining in the incubation mixture was expressed as the percentage of the )alues at 0 min incubation. The percentage turno)er is calculated using the following equation (%tumo)er = 100%turno)er - %parent remaining) and is recorded as the percentage turno)er in the Table 2.<br>

Compounds A, B and E contain a substituted adamantane, whereas the adamantane ring of compound EE is unsubstituted. The microsomal, metabolic, stability data in Table 2 demonstrates that substituted adamantane compounds of the present in)ention may exhibit an increase in metabolic stability compared to unsubstituted adamantane compounds which may lead to longer in )i)o half li)es and pharmacokmetic ad)antages o)er unsubstituted<br>
Glucocorticoids are steroid hormones that play an important role hi regulating multiple physiological processes in a wide range of tissues and organs. For example, glucocorticoids are potent regulators of glucose and lipid metabolism. Excess glucocorticoid action may lead to insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, )isceral obesity and hypertension. Cortisol is the major acti)e and cortisone is the major inacti)e form of glucocorticoids in humans, while corticosterone and dehydrocorticosterone are the major acti)e and inacti)e forms in rodents.<br>
Pre)iously, the main determinants of glucocorticoid action were thought to be the circulating hormone concentration and the density of glucocorticoid receptors hi the target tissues. In the last decade, it was disco)ered that tissue glucocorticoid le)els may also be controlled by 1 1 p-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases enzymes (1 1 B-HSDs). There are two 1 1 P-HSD isozymes which ha)e different substrate affinities and cofactors. The 1 lp-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases type 1 enzyme (1 lp-HSD-1) is a low affinity enzyme with Km for cortisone hi the micromolar range that prefers NADPH/NADP* (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) as cofactors. 1 1 P-HSD- 1 is widely expressed and particularly high expression le)els are found hi li)er, brain, lung, adipose tissue and )ascular smooth muscle cells. In )itro studies indicate mat 1 1 P-HSD- 1 is capable of acting both as a reductase and a dehydrogenase. Howe)er, many studies ha)e shown that it is predominantly a reductase in )i)o and hi intact cells. It con)erts inacti)e 1 1-ketoglucocorticoids (i.e., cortisone or<br>
dehydrocorticosterone) to acti)e 11-hydroxyglucocorticoids (i.e., cortisol or corticosterone) and therefore amplifies the glucocorticoid action in a tissue-specific manner.<br>
With only 20% homology to llp-HSD-l,the llp-hydroxysteroiddehydrogenases type 2 enzyme (11P-HSD-2) is a NAD+-dependent, high affinity dehydrogenase with a Km for cortisol in the nanomolar range. 11 P-HSD-2 is found primarily in mineralocorticoid target tissues, such as kidney, colon and placenta. Glucocorticoid action is mediated by the binding of glucocorticoids to receptors, such as mineralocorticoid receptors and glucocorticoid receptors. Through binding to its receptor, the main mineralocorticoid aldosterone controls the water and salts balance in the body. Howe)er, the mineralocorticoid receptors ha)e a high affinity for both cortisol and aldosterone. 11 P-HSD-2 con)erts cortisol to inacti)e cortisone, therefore pre)enting the non-selecti)e mineralocorticoid receptors from being exposed to high le)els of cortisol. Mutations in the gene encoding 11 P-HSD-2 cause Apparent Mineralocorticoid Excess Syndrome (AME), which is a congenital syndrome resulting hi h)pokaleamia and se)ere hypertension. AME Patients ha)e ele)ated cortisol le)els in mineralocorticoid target tissues due to reduced 11 P-HSD-2 acti)ity. The AME symptoms may also be induced by administration of 11 P-HSD-2 inhibitor, glycyrrhetinic acid. The acti)ity of 11 P-HSD-2 in placenta is probably important for protecting the fetus from excess exposure to maternal glucocorticoids, which may result in hypertension, glucose intolerance and growth retardation. Due to the potential side effects resulting from 11 P-HSD-2 inhibition, the present in)ention describes selecti)e llp-HSD-1 inhibitors.<br>
Glucocorticoid le)els and/or acti)ity may contribute to numerous disorders, including Type K diabetes, obesity, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and hypertension. Administration of the compounds of the present in)ention decreases the le)el of cortisol and other 1 lp-hydroxysteroids in target tissues, thereby reducing the effects of glucucocrticoid acti)ity in key target tissues. The present in)ention could be used for the treatment, control, amelioration, pre)ention, delaying the onset of or reducing the risk of de)eloping the diseases and conditions that are described herein.<br>
Since glucocorticoids are potent regulators of glucose and lipid metabolism, glucocorticoid action may contribute or lead to insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, )isceral obesity and hypertension. For example, cortisol antagonizes the insulin effect in li)er resulting in reduced insulin sensiti)ity and increased gluconeogenesis.<br>
Therefore, patients who already ha)e impaired glucose tolerance ha)e a greater probability of de)eloping type 2 diabetes in the presence of abnormally high le)els of cortisol. Pre)ious studies (B. R. Walker et al., J. of Clin. Endocrinology and Met, 80:3155-3159,1995) ha)e demonstrated that administration of non-selecti)e 1 lp-HSD-1 inhibitor, carbenoxolone, impro)es insulin sensiti)ity in humans. Therefore, administration of a therapeutically effecti)e amount of an 1 lp-HSD-1 inhibitor may treat, control, ameliorate, delay, or pre)ent the onset of type 2 diabetes.<br>
Administration of glucocorticoids in )i)o has been shown to reduce insulin secretion in rats (B. Billaudel et al., Horm. Metab. Res. 11: 555-560,1979). It has also been reported that con)ersion of dehydrocorticosterone to corticosterone by 1 lp-HSD-1 inhibits insulin secretion from isolated murine pancreatic P cells. (B. Da)ani et al., J. Biol. Chem., 275: 34841-34844,2000), and that incubation of isolated islets with an 1 lp-HSD-1 inhibitor impro)es glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (H Orstater et al., Diabetes Metab. Res. Re).. 21:359-366,2005). Therefore, administration of a therapeutically effecti)e amount of an 11P-HSD-1 inhibitor may treat, control, ameliorate, delay, or pre)ent the onset of type 2 diabetes by impro)ing glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in the pancreas.<br>
Abdominal obesity is closely associated with glucose intolerance (C. T. Montaque et al., Diabetes, 49: 883-888,2000), hyperinsulinemia, hypertriglyceridemia and other factors of metabolic syndrome (also known as syndrome X), such as high blood pressure, ele)ated YLDL and reduced HDL. Animal data supporting the role of 11 p-HSD-1 in the pathogenesis of the metabolic syndrome is extensi)e (Masuzaki, et al.. Science. 294:2166-2170,2001; Paterson, J.M., et al.; Proc Natl. Acad. ScL USA. 101:7088-93,2004; Montague and O'Rahilly. Diabetes. 49:883-888,2000). Therefore, administration of a therapeutically effecti)e amount of an 11 P-HSD-1 inhibitor may treat, control, ameliorate, delay, or pre)ent the onset of obesity. Long-term treatment with an 11 p-HSD-1 inhibitor may also be useful in delaying the onset of obesity, or perhaps pre)enting it entirely if the patients use an 1 ip-HSD-1 inhibitor in combination with controlled diet, exercise, or in combination or sequence with other pharmacological approaches.<br>
By reducing insulin resistance and/or maintaining serum glucose at normal concentrations and/or reducing obestity compounds of the present in)ention also ha)e utility in the treatment and pre)ention of conditions that accompany Type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance, including the metabolic syndrome or syndrome X, obesity, reacti)e hypoglycemia,<br>
and diabetic dyslipidemia.<br>
11P-HSD-1 is present in multiple tissues, including )ascular smooth muscle, where local glttcocorticoid le)els that are thought to increase insulin resistance, leading to reductions in nitric oxide production, and potentiation of the )asoconstricti)e effects of both catecholamines and angiotensin E (M. Pirpiris et al., Hypertension, 19:567-574,1992, C. Kernel et al., Steroids, 58:580-587,1993, B, R. Walker and B. C. Williams, dan. Sci. 82:597-605,1992; Hodge, G. et al Exp. Physiol 87:1-8,2002. High le)els of cortisol in tissues where the mineralocorticoid receptor is present may lead to hypertension, as obser)ed in Cushing's patients (See, D. N. Orth, N. Engl. J. Med. 332:791-803,1995, M. Boscaro, et al, Lancet, 357:783-791,2001, X. Bertagna, et al, Cushing's Disease. In: Melmed S., Ed. The Pituitary. 2nd ed. Maiden, MA: Blackwell; 592-612,2002). Transgenic mice o)erexpressing 11 p-HSD-1 in li)er and fat are also hypertensi)e, a phenotype belie)ed to result from glucocorticoid acti)ation of the renin angiotensin system (Paterson, J.M. et al, PNAS. 101: 7088-93,2004; Masuzaki, H. et al, J. Clin. In)est 112: 83-90,2003). Therefore, administration of a therapeutically effecti)e dose of an 1 lp-HSD-1 inhibitor may treat, control, ameliorate, delay, or pre)ent the onset of hypertension.<br>
Cushing's syndrome is a life-threatening metabolic disorder characterized by sustained and ele)ated glucocorticoid le)els caused by the endogenous and excessi)e production of cortisol from the adrenal glands. Typical Cushingoid characteristics include central obesity, diabetes and/or insulin resistance, moon face, buffalo hump, skin thinning, dyslipidemia, osteoporosis, reduced cogniti)e capacity, dementia, hypertension, sleep depri)ation, and atherosclerosis among others (Principles and Practice of Endocrinology and Metabolism. Edited by Kenneth Becker, Lippincott Williams and Wilkins Pulishers, Philadelphia, 2001; pg 723-8). The same characteristics can also arise from the exogenous administration of high doses of exogenous glucocorticoids, such as prednisone or dexamethasone, as part of an anti-inflammatory treatment regimen. Endogenous Cushings typically e)ol)es ftom pituitary hyperplasia, some other ectopic source of ACTH, or from an adrenal carcinoma or nodular hyperplasia. Administration of a therapeutically effecti)e dose of an 11 P-HSD-1 inhibitor may reduce local glucocorticoid concentrations and therefore treat, control, ameliorate, delay, or pre)ent the onset of Cushing's disease and/or similar symptoms arising from glucocorticoid treatment.<br>
11 P-HSD-1 is expressed in mammalian brain, and published data indicates that<br>
ghicocorticoids may cause neuronal degeneration and dysfunction, particularly in the aged (deQuer)sin etal.\ Hum Mol Genet. 13: 47-52,2004; Belanoffef al. J. PsychiatrRes. 35: 127-35,2001). E)idence in rodents and humans suggests that prolonged ele)ation of plasma glucocorticoid le)els impairs cogniti)e function that becomes more profound with aging. (Issa, AM. et al. J. Neurosci. 10:3247-54,1990; Lupien, S J et al. Nat Neurosci. 1: 69-73, 1998; Yau,JX.W.etal/¥oc NatlAcadSci USA. 98: 4716-4712,2001). Thekkapatefa/ has recently shown that 11J3-HSD-1 mRNA is expressed in human hippocampus, frontal cortex and cerebellum, and that treatment of elderly diabetic indi)iduals with the non-selecti)e HSD1/2 inhibitor carbenoxolone impro)ed )erbal fluency and memory (Proc Natl AcadSci USA. 101: 6743-9,2004). Additional CNS effects of glucocorticoids include glucocorticoid-induced acute psychosis which is of major concern to physicians when treating patients with these steroidal agents (Wolkowitzef a/.; Ann NY AcadSci. 1032: 191-4,2004). Conditional mutagenesis studies of the glucocorticoid receptor in mice ha)e also pro)ided genetic e)idence mat reduced glucocorticoid signaling in the brain results in decreased anxiety (Tranche, F. et al. (1999) Nature Genetics 23:99-103). Therefore, it is expected that potent, selecti)e llp-HSD-1 inhibitors would treat, control, ameliorate, delay, or pre)ent the onset of cogniti)e decline, dementia, steroid-induced acute psychosis, depression, and/or anxiety.<br>
In Cushing's patients, excess cortisol le)els contributes to the de)elopment of hypertension, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and obesity, conditions characteristic of metabolic syndrome (Orth, D.N. et al N. Engl. J. Med. 332:791-803,1995; Boscaro, M. et al., Lancet, 357:783-791,2001, Bertagna, X. et al, Cushing's Disease. In: Melmed S., Ed. The Pituitary. 2nd ed. Maiden, MA: Blackwell; 592-612,2002). Hypertension and dyslipidemia are also associated with de)elopment of atherosclerosis. 11J3-HSD-1 knockout mice are resistant to the dyslipidemic effects of a high fat diet and ha)e an impro)ed lipid profile )s wild type controls (Morton N.M. et al, JBC, 276:41293-41300,2001), and mice which o)erexpress llp-HSD-1 in fat exhibit the dyslipidemic phenotype characteristic of metabolic syndrome, including ele)ated circulating free fatty acids, and triclylgerides (Masuzaki, H., et al Science. 294:2166-2170,2001). Adrninistration of a selecti)e 110-HSD-1 inhibitor has also been shown to reduce ele)ated plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids in mice on a high fat diet, and significantly reduce aortic content of cholesterol esters, and reduce progression of atherosclerotic plaques in mice (Hermanowski-)osalka, A et al.<br>
J.Exp.Med. 202: 517-27,2005). The administration of a therapeutically effecti)e amount of an 11P-HSD-1 inhibitor would therefore be expected to treat, control, ameliorate, deky, or pre)ent the onset of dyslipidemia and/or atherosclerosis.<br>
Glucocorticoids are known to cause a )ariety of skin related side effects including 3km thimg, and impairment of wound healing (Anstead, G. Ad) Wound Care. 11: 277-85,1998; Beer, et al; )itam Horm. 59: 217-39,2000). llp-HSD-1 is expressed in human skin fibroblasts, and it has been shown that the topical treatment with the non-selecti)e HSD1/2 inhibitor glycerrhetinic acid increases the potency of topically applied hydrocortisone in a skin )asoconstrictor assay (Hammami, MM, and Siiteri, PK. J. Clin. Endocrinol Metab. 73:326-34,1991). Ad)antageous effects of selecti)e llp-HSD-1 inhibitors such as B)T.2733 on wound healing ha)e also been reported (WO 2004/11310). High le)els of glucocorticoids inhibit blood flow and formation of new blood )essels to healing tissues. In )itro and in )i)o models of angiogenesis ha)e shown that systemic antagonism with the glucocorticoid receptor RU-486 enchances angiogenesis in subcutaneous sponges as well as in mouse myocardium following coronary artery ligation (Walker, et al, PNAS, 102: 12165-70,2005). 1 lp-HSD-1 knockout mice also showed enhanced angiogenesis in )itro and in )i)o within sponges, wounds, and infarcted myocardium. It is therefore expected that potent, selecti)e 11 p-HSD-1 inhibitors would treat, control, ameliorate, delay, or pre)ent the onset of skin thinning and/or promote wound healing and/or angiogenesis.<br>
Although cortisol is an important and well-recognized anti-inflammatory agent (J. Baxer, Pharmac. Ther., 2:605-659,1976), if present in large amount it also has detrimental effects, hi certain disease states, such as tuberculosis, psoriasis and stress hi general, high glucocorticoid acti)ity shifts the immune response to a humoral response, when in fact a cell based response may be more beneficial to patients. Inhibition of 11 P-HSD-1 acti)ity may reduce glucocorticoid le)els, thereby shifting the immuno response to a cell based response. (D. Mason, Immunology Today, 12:57-60,1991, G. A, W. Rook, Baillier's Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 13:576-581,1999). Therefore, administration of llp-HSD-1 specific inhibitors could treat, control, ameliorate, delay, or pre)ent the onset of tuberculosis, psoriasis, stress, and diseases or conditions where high glucocorticoid acti)ity shifts the immune response to a humoral response.<br>
One of the more significant side effects associated with topical and systemic<br>
glucocorticoid therapy is glaucoma, resulting in serious increases in intraocular pressure, with the potential to result in blindness (Armaly et al.; Arch OpkthdlmoL 78: 193-7,1967; Stokes etal; In)est Ophthabnol )is Sd. 44: 5163-7,2003;). The cells that produce the majority of aqueous humor in the eye are the nonpigmented epithelial cells (NPE). These cells ha)e been demonstrated to express llp-HSD-1, and consistent with the expression of llp-HSD-1, is the finding of ele)ated ratios of cortisolrcortisone in the aqueous humor (Rauz et al.. In)est Ophthcdmol )is Sd. 42: 2037-2042,2001). Furthermore, it has been shown that patients who ha)e glaucoma, but who are not taking exogenous steroids, ha)e ele)ated le)els of cortisol )s. cortisone in their aqueous humor (Rauz et al. QJM. 96: 481-490,2003.) Treatment of patients with the nonselecti)e HSD1/2 inhibitor carbenoxolone for 4 or 7 days significantly lowered intraocular pressure and local cortisol generation within the eye (Rauz etal.;QJM. 96: 481-490,2003.). It is therefore expected that potent, selecti)e llp-HSD-1 inhibitors would treat, control, ameliorate, delay, or pre)ent the onset of glaucoma.<br>
Glucocorticoids (GCs) are known to increase bone resorption and reduce bone fonnationin mammals (Turner et al. Caldf Tissue Int. 54: 311-5,1995; Lane, NBet al. MedPediatrOncol. 41: 212-6,2003). llp-HSD-lmRNA expression and reductase acti)ity ha)e been demonstrated in primary cultures of human osteoblasts in homogenates of human bone (Bland et al; J. Endocrinol. 161:455-464,1999; Cooper et al.; Bone, 23: 119-125, 2000). In surgical explants obtained from orthopedic operations, llp-HSD-1 expression in primary cultures of osteoblasts was found to be increased approximately 3-fold between young and old donors (Cooper et al.; J. Bone AGner Res. 17: 979-986,2002). Glucocorticoids, such as prednisone and dexamethasone, are also commonly used to treat a )ariety of inflammatory conditions including arthritis, inflammatory bowl disease, and asthma. These steroidal agents ha)e been shown to increase expression of 1lp-HSD-1 mRNA and acti)ity in human osteoblasts (Cooper ef al.; J. Bone Miner Res. 17: 979-986, 2002). These studies suggest mat 11 P-HSD-1 plays a potentially important role in the de)elopment of bone-related ad)erse e)ents as a result of excessi)e glucocorticoid le)els or acti)ity. Bone samples taken from healthy human )olunteers orally dosed with the non-selecti)e HSD1/2 inhibitor carbenoxolone showed a significant decrease in markers of bone resorption (Cooper ef al.; Bone. 27: 375-81,2000). It is therefore expected mat potent, selecti)e 11 p-HSD-1 inhibitors would treat, control, ameliorate, delay, or pre)ent the onset of conditions of glucocorticoid-induced or age-dependent osteoporosis'<br>
