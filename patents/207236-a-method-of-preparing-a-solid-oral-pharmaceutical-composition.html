New Oral Formulation<br>
The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition, in particular to a composition for administering active agents which are poorly soluble in aqueous mecia and/or which are acid sensitive. More particularly, the present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition for administering active agents acting on the gastro-intestinal system. The present invention also relates to a process for manufacturing such compositions. The term "pharmaceutical" also covers veterinary use.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions containing active agents which are poorly soluble in aqueous media and/or acid sensitive are difficult to manufacture. One of the problems that may occur concerns adsorption of the active agent on the process equipment during the manufacturing process. Due to the poor solubility of such active agents it is also difficult to obtain pharmaceutical compositions which upon administration have a good dissolution rate. As a further problem, active agents may be degraded, e.g.. chemically, during a manufacturing prccess using acidic conditions or during the storage of the composition.<br>
The present invention provides compositions and processes which avoids or minimise one or more of the above problems.<br>
We have now surprisingly found that it is possible to produce a pharmaceutical composition for administering of active agents which are poorly soluble in aqueous media, e.g., pure water, and/or acid sensitive, and which upon administration has good dissolution properties, a good bioavailability and is surprisingly efficacious.<br>
The present invention provides in one aspect a solid oral pharmaceutical composition, e.g., a tablet, comprising an active agent which is poorly soluble in aqueous media, and/or acid sensitive, and a disintegrant, e.g., a super-disintegrant, which is present in an amount of at least 15% by weight based on the total weight of the composition.<br>
By "poorly soluble" is meant an active agent having a solubility in aqueous media more than 0.001% and less than 10%, e.g., less than 1 %, e.g., less than 0.1%, e.g., less than 0.05%, e.g., less than 0.02%, at room temperature, e.g., 25°C.<br><br>
Ey "acid sensitive" is meant an active agent which under even slightly acidic conditions, e.g., at pH 6, may be transformed to a significant extent in a degradation product, e.g., by chemical degradation, which may have no or changed activity, e.g., within 2 hours. Examples of compounds are known in the art and may be ascertained by routine experimentation.<br>
Bv "disintecrant" is meant a substance or mixture of substance added to a solid pharmaceutical composition, e.g., a tablet, to facilitate its break-up or disintegration after administration in order that the active ingredient is released from the composition as efficiently as possible to allow for its rapid dissolution (see e.g. "Remington's Pharmaceutical Science"1 18th edition (1990), The Theory and Practice of Industrial Pharmacy' Lachman et al. Lea &amp; Febiger (1970)).<br>
We have also found difficulties on producing stable commercially acceptable formulations, e.g., tablets, of compounds such as those disclosed in EP505322 (herein incorporated by reference) and which are useful as 5-HTa receptcr agonists or partial agonists.<br>
A preferred 5-H74 partial agonist disclosed in 5P505322 is Tegasercd (3-{5-methcxy-1H-<br>
. J&gt; ■<br>
;ndcl-3-yl-methylene)-N-pentylcarbazimidamide) (example 13) of formula<br><br>
which is referred hereinafter as Compound A, or a pharmaceutical^ acceptable salt form thereof, e.g., the hydrogen maleate (hereinafter Timf) salt. Compound A has a solubility of about 0.02% at 25°C in water and is acid sensitive. We have found that compositions may be produced which give good absorption even in the stomach. We have also found that Compound A may be adsorbed by certain excipients so that its dissolution upon administration may be substantially reduced.<br><br>
Little has been published in detail en 5-HT4 receptor agonists, partial agonists or antagonists bicpharmaceutical properties, e.g., their site of action is not known.<br>
The present invention provides in a further aspect pharmaceutical compositions allowing a complete dissolution cf 5-nT4 receptor agonists, partial agonists or antagonists, e.g., Compound A, when administered ic humans, e.g., patients, in need thereof. These compositions allow a good bioavailability and are surprisingly efficacious. Moreover, they are stable and weil reproducible. A process for their preparation is also provided.<br>
Active agents which may be used in compositiens according to the present invention are more generally those acting en the gastro-lntestinal system, e.g., serotonergic active agents, e.g., full agonists, partial agonists and antagonists of 5-HT4 receptcrs to the extent they are pooriy soluble and/or acid sensitive. They are preferably in salt form, e.g., hydrogen maleate or hydrochloride, and may be in free form.<br>
The 5-HT4 receptor is a cloned species cf the serotonin receptor family which comprises at least 14 distinct G protein-coupled receptors (the receptor iencphcre of the 5-HT3 subtype excluded). Four splice variants of the human receptor, 5-HT4A , 5-HT4B . 5-HT4c , and 5-r.Tcc, have been identified which differ in the length and sequence of the protein's C terminus (Elcndel et al.( FE3S Letters (1SS7) **2:465-474; Blondel et al., J, Neurcchem. (1SS8) 70: 2252-2261). Biochemical characterisation of 5-HT4 receptors revealed a positive coupiing to adenylyi cyclase. 5-HT4 receptor expression in man has been found in the brain, the gut, the atria, the urinary bladder and kidneys.<br>
Compounds capable of acting on the serotonin receptor are substituted benzamides, e.g.,<br>
cisapride, renzacride, zaccpride, ciebopride, cinitapride, mesapride, lintoprice,<br>
metocicpramide, or benzoic esters, e.g., RS 23597-190, SB 2G4070, SB ^207710, or<br>
aminoguanidines, zacopride, prucalopride, SB 205149, SC 53116, RS 67333, RS 67506,<br>
BIMU 1, BIMU 8, (S)-RS 56532, Tropisetron, Alosetron, GR113808, GR125487,<br>
SB 207266, RS 23597, RS 39604, RS 100235, DAU 6285, SC 53606, 3-(5-hydroxy-7-<br>
methyl-1H-indGl~3-yl-        methyIene)-N-pentyl-N-methyl-caitazimidamide^	indazpIe-3-<br>
carboxamides, 2-oxobenzamidazoIe-3-carboxamides (as disclosed in EP 908 459 which is herein incorporated by reference) etc.<br><br>
5-HT.t receptor agonists are considered as compounds which can activate 5-HTi receptors under quiescent/resting conditions (complete or partial activation). As 5-H74 receptor full agonists or partial agonists one may cite (S)-zacopride, cisapride, prucaiopride. SB 205149, SC53115, RS 67333, RS 67506, EIMU1, EIMU 3, (S)-RS 56532 and Compound A, particularly its hydrogen maieate salt.<br>
5-HT4 receptor antagonists are considered as compounds which do not activate 5-HT4 receptors but act as inhibitors of agonists at 5-HT4 receptors. As 5-HT4 receptor antagonists one may cite GR 113808, GR 125487, S3 203186, SB 204070, S3 207266, RS 23597, RS 39604, RS 100235, DAU 62S5, SC 53606, 3-(5-hydroxy-7-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl-methyleneJ-N-pentyl-N-methyl-carfcazimidamide.<br>
5-HT4 receptor-agonists are useful for the prevention and treatment of gastro-intestinai motility disorders, e.g., Irritable Ecwei Syndrome (IBS), Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD), Functional Dyspepsia (FD) and Post Operative Ileus (POI).<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the composition of the invention comprises 20 to 60%. e.g., 30 to 50%, e.g. 40% by weight cf cisintecrant based on the total weight of the composition. We have observed that the use cf such a high percentage of disintegrant further improves the dissolution rate in aqueous media, but also prevents the active agent from adsorbing en excipients.<br>

Preferably, the disintegrant is crospovidone which is preferably water insoluble. Preferably it rapidly exhibits high capillary cr pronounced hydration capacity with little tendency :c gel formation. Preferably the panicle size is from about 1 to 5G0 micrcmeters. Preferred panicle size distribution is less than -100 micrometers, e.g., for Poiyplasdone XL3, less than SO micrometers, e.g., less than 7- micrometers for, e.g., Poiyplasdone XL-1C<s approximately greater than micrometers and maximum of micrcmeters in size for e.g. kollicon cl3. a preferred crcspcvidcne is poiyplasdone xl with density about g cr></s>

Other conventional excipients which may optionally be present in the composition'of the invention include preservatives, stabilisers, anti-adherents or silica flew conditioners or giidants, e.g., silicon dioxide (e.g., Sylcid'3, Aeros.T3) as well as FD&amp;C colours such as ferric oxides.<br>
Other excipients disclcsed in the literature, as for instance in Fiedlers "Lexicon e'er Hiifstoffe", 4th Edition, ECV Aulendcrf 19S6 and "Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients3 Wade and Weller Ed.(1994), the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference, may be used in the pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention.<br>
The invention is particularly useful fcr pharmaceutical compositions containing an active agent, e.g., an 5H74 receptor agonist, partial agonist or antagonist, e.g., compound A, e.g., the hydrogen maleate salt, which is present in an amount within the range of from about 0.2% to about 20%,'e.g. 0.5 to 15%, and preferably from about 1% to about 10% by weight of the composition.<br>
A preferred composition cf the invention may comprise from about 0.5 to about 15% by weight of active agent, e.g.. a 5H7* receptor agonist, e.g., compound A, e.g., the hydrogen maieate salt, from 20 tc 60% by weight of disintegrant, e.g., crcspovidone, from 1 to about 20% by weight of a lubricant, e.g., mcncgiycerylstearate, from 0.1 to about 10% by weight of a surfactant, e.g., pclcxalkcl, from about 10 to 50% by weight of a diluent, e.g., lactose, and from 1 to 10% by weight cf a binder, e.g., hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (e.g. HPMC-3). From 1 to 10% by weight cf PEG may also be added.<br>
The weight ratio cf the active agent tc the disintegrant may be from 1:1 to 1:400, e.g., 1:5 to 1:100,1:8 to 1:50, e.g., 1:16 to 1:20.<br>
In a further aspect the present invention provides a pharmaceutical oral, e.g., tablet, composition comprising one of the active agents cited above, e.g., a 5-HT4 agonist, partial agonist or antagonist, e.g., Tegaserod, said composition having dissolution characteristics in water or in USP buffers pH 6.8 and 7.5 of:<br><br><br><br>
For example a ccmpcsiticn according to the invention, e.g., comprising Tegssercd as the active agent, may have dissolution characteristics in water or in US? buffers pH 6.3 and 7.5 cf: <br>
In a further aspect the present invention provides a pharmaceutical crai, e.g., tablet; composition comprising one cf the active agents cited above, e.g., a 5-HT.i agonist, partial agonist or antagonist, e.g., Tegasercd, wherein in use 80% cf said active agent is released in water or in USF buffers pH 6.3 and 7.5 within 5 minutes.<br>
in a further aspect, the present invention provides the use of at least 15% by weight of a cisintegrant in the manufacturing of pharmaceutical composition for the administration cf an acid sensitive and/cr poorly soluble, e.g., in aqueous media, active agent, e.g., a 5-HT4 receptor agonist, e.g., compound A, e.g. the hydrogen maleate salt.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention are useful in the known indications of the particular active agent incorporated therein.<br>
Tne exact amounts of active agent and of the formulation to be administered depend en a number of factors, e.g. the condition to be treated, the desired duration of treatment and the rate of release of active agent.<br>
For example, the amount of the active agent required and the release rate thereof may be determined on the basis of conventional in vitro or in vivo techniques, determining how long a particular active agent concentration in the blood plasma remains at an acceptable level for a therapeutic effect<br><br><br>
The pharmaceutical composition of the invention comprising a 5-ri74 receptcr agonist, partial agonist or antagonist is particularly useful for improving sensor/ perception cf rectal distension, e.g. for the treatment of anal incontinence, or for preventing, modulating or treating visceral pain cr discomfort.<br>
5-HT4 receptor agonists, partial agonists cr antagonists, e.g. as disclosed in EP-A1-5C5.322, en the basis cf observed activity, e.g. stimulatory effect en the peristaltic reflex in the isolated guinea-cic :ieum, e.g. as described in EP-A1-505.222. have been found to be useful fcr the treatment of gastrc-intestinal motility disorders, for example to normalise cr to improve the gastric emptying and intestinal transit in subjects having a oisturbec motility, e.g. in irritabie bev/ei syndrome.<br>
in accordanca with the present invention, it has now surprisingly been found that 5-HT4 receptor agonists, partial agonists or antagonists have a beneficial effect, e.g. they exert modulating effects, on the sensor/ perception of rectal distension and en visceral sensitivity cr perception.<br>
It is admitted that receptor properties are net uniform throughout the cut and that thg type of afferent innervation reflects the quality of sensations originating from a particular organ. Fcr example, the rectum belongs to those parts of the gastro-intestinai tract from which also non-painful sensations arise, in contrast to the colon from which only painful sensations emanate.<br>
Anal incontinence may be due to functional disturbances of the main anal continence mechanisms.  Anal continence appears to be based on a co-ordinated functioning of the<br><br><br>

particularly en extrinsic neurones cf the cut, in a subject in need thereof, which<br>
method comprises administering to said subject an effective amount of a 5-KT4<br>
receptor agonist or partial agonist or a pharmaceutical^ acceptable salt thereof.<br>
1.4.	A method fcr modulating visceral sensitivity, discomfort or pain via stimulation of 5-<br>
HT4 receptors present on afferent nerve terminals, particularly on extrinsic neurones<br>
of the gut, in a subject in need thereof, which method comprises administering to said<br>
subject an effective amount of a 5-HT4 receptor agonist or partial agonist or a<br>
pharmaceutical^ acceptable salt thereof.<br><br><br>
3.	A 5-HT4 receptor agonist, paniai agonist or antagonist cr a pharmaceutical^<br>

use in a method as defined under 1.1 to 1.7 above; cr<br>
4.	A pharmaceutical composition for use in a method as defined under 1.1 to 1.7 above<br>
comprising a 5-HT4 receptor agonist, partial agonist or antagonist cr a<br>
pharmaceutical acceptable salt thereof, together with one cr mere pharmaceutical/<br>
acceptable diiuents or carriers therefor, e.g. a composition such as disclosed<br>
hereinabove.<br>
Preferred compounds for use in accordance with the invention include e.g. those listed hereinabove, particularly 5-HT4 receptor full agonists or partial agonists, e.g. (S)-zacopride, cisapride, prucaiopride, SB 205149, SC 53116, RS 67333, RS 67506, BIMU1, BIMU8, (S)-RS 56532, especially Compound A and particularly its hydrogen maleate salt, more<br><br><br>
After obtaining 2 distension profiles (5 rnin each) and/cr 10 rnin cf peristalsis under centre! conditions, a 5-HTi receptor agonist, partial agonist cr antagonist, e.g., Compound A, cr vehicle is applied i.v. and the protocol is repeated. Subsequently, the activity of additional units is recorded in the presence of a 5-HT4 receptor agonist, partial agonist or antagonist, e.g., Compound A, or vehicle according to the distensicn/peristaisis protocol. In this assay, the firing rate cf the rectal afferents is reduced after administration cf a 5-HT4 receptor agonist or partial agonist at a dose range of from 0.1 to 3 mg/kg i.v., at distension pressures above 20 mmHg.
