COMPOSITIONS FOR SLEEPING DISORDERS<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention generally relates to a composition for treating, preventing or ameliorating insomnia and other sleeping disorders.<br>
Description of the Background<br>
A large percentage of the adult population suffers from insomnia in some form at some time in their lives. This may vary from a single episode of one night's duration to chronic conditions. Transient insomnia is an insomnia that is present for one to several days, and is less than one week in duration. Short term insomnia is an insomnia of one to three weeks in duration. Chronic insomnia is typically accepted to involve episodes greater than three (3) weeks in duration. The insomnia may further involve onset insomnia (difficulty in falling asleep) and/or maintenance insomnia (difficulty in maintaining uninterrupted sleep). It is well known that the sleep deprivation resulting from such insomnia adversely affects cognition, safety and quality of life.<br>
Known treatments for insomnia include the administration of medication, either of the non-barbiturate or barbiturate type, shortly before bedtime. While both types of sedatives may be used to effectively treat insomnia, neither is without its undesirable side effects. Barbiturate type sedatives, such as secobarbital (sold by Eli Lilly and Company under the trade name of Seconal.RTM.) are general depressants. While effective, these medications are well known to lose their effectiveness after a few days. Furthermore, they are highly addictive and commonly abused.<br>
The groups of medications now most commonly used for the treatment of insomnia are the imidazopyridines, the pyrazolopyrimidines and the benzodiazepines. There is one available hypnotic in the imidazopyridine group, one in the pyrazolopyrimidine group and there are five in the benzodiazepine group. They differ significantly in half lives but are otherwise very similar and equally effective. They have supplanted the barbiturates as the principal treatment for insomnia because they have less addiction potential and are associated with less risk for suicide than the barbiturates unless taken with alcohol. However, these groups, too, are addictive and their wide usage draws concern as their potential side effects become more apparent. These side effects include daytime sedation, decreased cognitive abilities such as memory loss and, most recently in the case of Halcion.RTM. (triazolam) and possibly Ambien.RTM. (zolpidem) and Sonata.RTM. (zaleplon), feelings of agitation after the drug's therapeutic effects pass.<br><br>
Other pharmaceutical formulations, e.g., those described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,502,047, 5,643,897, 6,211,229, and 6,344,487 can be used for treating insomnia with limited effectiveness. Therefore, there is a need for new compositions effective for treating insomnia and related disorders.<br>
The compositions and embodiments thereof described herein address the above described problems and other needs. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Provided herein is a composition for treating, preventing or ameliorating insomnia and related disorders. The composition can include an effective amount of myricitrin, a related compound, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. The composition may also include a physiologically acceptable carrier such as a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The composition can be formulated into any formulation for a desired mode of administration. The composition can be used to treat a disorder such as insomnia, depression-related disease, stress-related disease, depression-related sleep disorder, neurodegeneration diseases, Alzheimer's disease, Pick's disease, spinocerbellar degeneration, Parkinson's disease, chorea, glaucoma, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, senile macular degeneration, hepatic encephalopathy, demyelinating diseases, Lewy body dementia, multi-infarct dementia, multiple sclerosis or combinations thereof.

Formulation carriers<br>
The composition described herein may be administered to a subject in need of treatment by a variety of routes of administration, including orally and parenterally, (e.g., intravenously, subcutaneously or intramedullary), intranasally, as a suppository or using a "flash" formulation, i.e., allowing the medication to dissolve in the mouth without the need to use water, topically, intradermally, subcutaneously and/or administration via mucosal routes in liquid or solid form. The composition can be formulated into a variety of dosage forms, e.g., extract, pills, tablets, microparticles, capsules, oral liquid.<br>
There may also be included as part of the composition pharmaceutically or physiologically acceptable compatible binding agents, and/or adjuvant materials. The active materials can also be mixed with other active materials including antibiotics, antifungals, other virucidals and immunostimulants which do not impair the desired action and/or supplement the desired action.<br>
In one embodiment, the mode of administration of the composition described herein is oral. Oral compositions generally include an inert diluent or an edible carrier. They may be enclosed in gelatin capsules or compressed into tablets. For the purpose of oral therapeutic administration, the aforesaid compounds may be incorporated with excipients and used in the<br><br>
form of tablets, troches, capsules, elixirs, suspensions, syrups, wafers, chewing gums and the like. In general, an effective dosage for myricitrin or a derivative thereof, e.g., compounds of Formulae I or III, described above, is in the range of 0.01 mg/kg/day to 100 mg/kg/day, preferably 0.01 mg/kg/day to 50 mg/kg/day in single or divided doses. Some variation in dosage will necessarily occur, however, depending on the condition of the subject being treated. These preparations should produce a serum concentration of active ingredient of from about 0.01 nM to 1,000,000 nM, e.g., from about 0.2 to 40μM. A preferred concentration range is from 0.2 to 20 μM and most preferably about 1 to 10 μM. However, the concentration of active ingredient in the drug composition itself depends on bioavailability of the drug and other factors known to those of skill in the art.<br>
In another embodiment, the mode of administration of the compositions described herein is topical or mucosal administration. A specifically preferred mode of mucosal administration is administration via female genital tract. Another preferred mode of mucosal administration is rectal administration.<br>
Various polymeric and/or non-polymeric materials can be used as adjuvants for enhancing mucoadhesiveness of the composition disclosed herein. The polymeric material suitable as adjuvants can be natural or synthetic polymers. Representative natural polymers include, for example, starch, chitosan, collagen, sugar, gelatin, pectin, alginate, karya gum, methylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose, methylethylcellulose, and hydroxypropylcellulose. Representative synthetic polymers include, for example, poly(acrylic acid), tragacanth, poly(methyl vinylether-co-maleic anhydride), poly(ethylene oxide), carbopol, poly(vinyl pyrrolidine), poly(ethylene glycol), poly(vinyl alcohol), poly(hydroxyethylmethylacrylate), and polycarbophil. Other bioadhesive materials available in the art of drug formulation can also be used (see, for example, Bioadhesion - Possibilities and Future Trends, Gurny and Junginger, eds., 1990).<br>
It is to be noted that dosage values also varies with the specific severity of the disease condition to be alleviated. It is to be further understood that for any particular subject, specific dosage regimens should be adjusted to the individual need and the professional judgment of the person administering or supervising the administration of the aforesaid compositions. It is to be further understood that the concentration ranges set forth herein are exemplary only and they do not limit the scope or practice of the invention. The active ingredient may be administered at once, or may be divided into a number of smaller doses to be administered at varying intervals of time.<br><br>
The formulation may contain the following ingredients: a binder such as microcrystalline cellulose, gum tragacanth or gelatin; an excipient such as starch or lactose, a disintegrating agent such as alginic acid, Primoge!, corn starch and the like; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate or Sterotes; a glidant such as colloidal silicon dioxide; and a sweetening agent such as sucrose or saccharin or flavoring agent such as peppermint, methyl salicylate, or orange flavoring may be added. When the dosage unit form is a capsule, it may contain, in addition to material of the above type, a liquid carrier such as a fatty oil. Other dosage unit forms may contain other various materials which modify the physical form of the dosage unit, for example, as coatings. Thus tablets or pills may be coated with sugar, shellac, or other enteric coating agents. Materials used in preparing these various compositions should be pharmaceutically or physiologically pure and non-toxic in the amounts used.<br>
The solutions or suspensions may also include the following components: a sterile diluent such as water for injection, saline solution, fixed oils, polyethylene glycols, glycerine, propylene glycol or other synthetic solvents; antibacterial agents such as benzyl alcohol or methylparabens; antioxidants such as ascorbic acid or sodium bisulfite; chelating agents such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; buffers such as acetates, citrates or phosphates and agents for the adjustment of tonicity such as sodium chloride or dextrose. The parental preparation can be enclosed in ampoules, disposable syringes or multiple dose vials made of glass or plastic.<br>
The compositions of the present invention are prepared as formulations with pharmaceutically or physiologically acceptable carriers. Preferred are those carriers that will protect the active compound against rapid elimination from the body, such as a controlled release formulation, including implants and microencapsulated delivery systems. Biodegradable, biocompatable polymers can be used, such as polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen, and polylactic acid. Methods for preparation of such formulations can be readily performed by one skilled in the art.<br>
Liposomal suspensions (including liposomes targeted to infected cells with monoclonal antibodies to viral antigens) are also preferred as pharmaceutically or physiologically acceptable carriers. Methods for encapsulation or incorporation of compounds into liposomes are described by Cozzani, L; Jori, G.; Bertoloni, G.; Milanesi, C; Sicuro, T. Chem. Biol. Interact. 53, 131-143 (1985) and by Jori, G.; Tomio, L.; Reddi, E.; Rossi, E. Br. J. Cancer 48, 307-309 (1983). These may also be prepared according to methods known to those skilled in the art, for example, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,522,811 (which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). For example, liposome formulations may be prepared by dissolving appropriate lipid(s) (such as<br><br>
stearoyl phosphatidyl ethanolamine, stearoyl phosphatidyl choline, arachadoyl phosphatidyl choline, and cholesterol) in an inorganic solvent that is then evaporated, leaving behind a thin film of dried lipid on the surface of the container. An aqueous solution of the active compound is then introduced into the container. The container is then swirled by hand to free lipid material from the sides of the container and to disperse lipid aggregates, thereby forming the liposomal suspension.<br>
Other methods for encapsulating compounds within liposomes and targeting areas of the body are described by Sicuro, T.; Scarcelli, V.; Vigna, M F.; Cozzani, I. Med. Biol. Environ. 15(1), 67-70 (1987) and Jori, G,; Reddi, E.; Cozzani, L; Tomio, L. Br. J. Cancer, 53(5), 615-21 (1986).<br>
The composition described herein may be administered in single (e.g., once daily) or multiple doses or via constant infusion. The compounds of this invention may also be administered alone or in combination with pharmaceutically or physiologically acceptable carriers, vehicles or diluents, in either single or multiple doses. Suitable pharmaceutical or physiologically carriers, vehicles and diluents include inert solid diluents or fillers, sterile aqueous solutions and various organic solvents. The compositions described herein are then readily administered in a variety of dosage forms such as tablets, powders, lozenges, syrups, injectable solutions and the like. These pharmaceutical compositions can, if desired, contain additional ingredients such as flavorings, binders, excipients and the like according to a specific dosage form.<br>
Thus, for example, for purposes of oral administration, tablets containing various excipients such as sodium citrate, calcium carbonate and/or calcium phosphate may be employed along with various disintegrants such as starch, alginic acid and/or certain complex silicates, together with binding agents such as polyvinylpyrrolidone, sucrose, gelatin and/or acacia. Additionally, lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, sodium lauryl sulfate and talc are often useful for tabletting purposes. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard filled gelatin capsules. Preferred materials for this include lactose or milk sugar and high molecular weight polyethylene glycols. When aqueous suspensions or elixirs are desired for oral administration, the active pharmaceutical/physiological agent therein may be combined with various sweetening or flavoring agents, coloring matter or dyes and, if desired, emulsifying or suspending agents, together with diluents such as water, ethanol, propylene glycol, glycerin and/or combinations thereof.<br>
For parenteral administration, solutions of the compounds of this invention in sesame or peanut oil, aqueous propylene glycol, or in sterile aqueous solutions may be employed. Such<br><br>
aqueous solutions should be suitably buffered if necessary and the liquid diluent first rendered isotonic with sufficient saline or glucose. These particular aqueous solutions are especially suitable for intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous and intraperitoneal administration. In this connection, the sterile aqueous media employed are all readily available by standard techniques known to those skilled in the art.<br>
For intranasal administration or administration by inhalation, the compounds of the invention are conveniently delivered in the form of a solution or suspension from a pump spray container that is squeezed or pumped by the patient or as an aerosol spray presentation from a pressurized container or a nebulizer, with the use of a suitable propellant, e.g., dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide or other suitable gas. In the case of a pressurized aerosol, the dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. The pressurized container or nebulizer may contain a solution or suspension of a compound of this invention. Capsules and cartridges (made, for example, from gelatin) for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated containing a powder mix of a compound or compounds of the invention and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch.<br>
The composition provided herein can also be used with another pharmaceutically or physiologically active agent effective for a disease such as neurodisorders, cardiovascular disorders, tumors, AIDS, depression, and/or type-1 and type-2 diabetes. Such additional agents can be, for example, antiviral agent, antibiotics, anti-depression agent, anti-cancer agents, immunosuppressant, anti-fungal, and a combination thereof.<br>
The composition described herein can be formulated alone or together with the other agent in a single dosage form or in a separate dosage form. Methods of preparing various formulations with a certain amount of active ingredient are known, or will be apparent in light of this disclosure, to those skilled in this art. For examples of methods of preparing pharmaceutical formulations, see Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa., 19th Edition (1995).<br>
Methods of Use<br>
The composition described herein can be used for treating, preventing or ameliorating the above described conditions in a mammal, including a human. The composition can be administered as part of an appropriate dosage regimen designed to obtain the benefits of the therapy. The appropriate dosage regimen, the amount of each dose administered and the intervals between doses of the compound will depend upon the compound of Formulae I, II or IV of this<br><br>
invention being used, the type of pharmaceutical compositions being used, the characteristics of the subject being treated and the severity of the conditions.<br>

C57/B6 mice were randomised into groups and orally administered. Compound mixtures -1,-2 ,-3 (Table 3), which are mixtures of dihydromyricetin (compound A), myricetin (compound<br><br><br><br>
between each dosing. EEG waveforms were analysed using a power spectral analysis of each 5 second epoch and scored manually into % duration of NREM sleep for each hour over a 12 hour period.<br>
Figures 7A-7C shows the duration of NREM sleep induced by zolpidem (5mg/kg, p.o., Figure 7A), zopiclone (5mg/kg, p.o., Figure 7B) or Compound Mixture (50mg/kg, p.o., Figure 7C), which is a mixture of dihydromyricetin (compound A), myricetin (compound B) and myricitrin (compound C) (A / B /C =1:0.1: 0.08) in male Wistar rats during 12-hour light cycle. Data were analysed using Two-way ANOVA versus vehicle treatment (*p
As shown in Figures 7A-7C, zolpidem (5mg/kg,p.o., Figure 7 A), Zopiclone (5mg/kg,p.o&gt;, Figure 7B) and the Compound Mixture (Figure 7C) all significantly increased NREM sleep within the first hour following treatment, indicating that they were able to significantly reduce sleep latency compared to vehicle treatment. During the second hour following treatment, compound mixture (Figure 7C) continued to maintain long durations of NREM sleep, whereas zolpidem and zopiclone (Figures 7A and 7B) were not significantly different from vehicle treatment. During the remainder of the sleep period, zolpidem (Figure 7A) failed to significantly improve NREM sleep compared to vehicle, whereas zopiclone (Figure 7B) only significantly improved NREM sleep duration during the 8th hour, but had a negative effect on sleep quality during the 6th hour of sleep. Conversely, Compound Mixture (Figure 7C) was also able to significantly improve NREM sleep during the 7th and 8th hour of sleep and had no observed detrimental effect on NREM duration during the course of the sleep period.<br>
Further tests showed that compound mixtures of A: B: C in the ratios of 1-2 : 0.1-0.12 : 0.05-0.08 all showed similar results in telemetry rats.<br>
The present data indicate that the Compound Mixture is able to significantly reduce sleep latency with a similar effect to existing sedatives zolpidem and zopiclone in rats. Furthermore the Compound Mixture is able to maintain longer periods of NREM sleep during the sleep period and thus attain a deeper sleep than both zolpidem and zopiclone, indicating that the Compound Mixture may be beneficial for improving the quality of sleep.<br>
