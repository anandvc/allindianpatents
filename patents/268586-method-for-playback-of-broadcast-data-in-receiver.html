The broadcast data stored in the memory 130 can be deleted under the control of the controller 120 at a specified point in time, such as after a broadcast playback, for example.<br>
[0050]      Under the control of the controller 120, the display unit 140 displays various processes, control actions and images of the broadcast terminal 10. The display unit 140 provides various information or a command input related to the broadcast reception, reservation, and playback through a screen. Thus, a user can recognize the progress of various processes through the display unit 140. The user may also recognize control of the broadcast terminal 10 via the various information or command inputs displayed on the display unit 140.<br>
[0051]     The audio processor 150 processes voice signals inputted into a microphone<br>
MIC and outputted through a speaker SPK. Preferably, the audio processor 150 converts various processes of the broadcast terminal 10 into a voice signal and outputs the signal through the speaker SPK. Alternatively, the audio processor 150 may process various information or commands inputted through the microphone MIC via a voice signal. For example, various information or a command related to a broadcast reception, reservation, and playback of the<br>
12<br><br>
broadcast terminal 10 may be inputted through the microphone MIC. The audio processor 150 can then deliver the inputted information to the controller 120 by using a voice input unit having a voice recognition unit, for example.<br>
[0052]     The mobile communications module 160 is a wireless telecommunications device for transmitting and receiving voice or data signals with a mobile communications network. Preferably, the broadcast terminal 10 including the mobile communications module 160 performs various communications, such as voice communications, message transfer, web page access, data transmission and reception, telephone connection, and instant messaging.<br>
[0053]      Preferably, the broadcast terminal 10 may be implemented with various forms. For example, the broadcast terminal 10 may be a dedicated broadcast terminal receiving only a digital broadcasting signal, a broadcast terminal combined with the mobile communications module 160 described above, a digital broadcast terminal combined with a navigation function, and a terminal having a display device capable of regenerating a broadcast signal.<br>
[0054]      Referring to Fig. 2b, in another aspect of the present invention, a broadcast<br>
signal is received through a first tuner 102 and a second tuner 104. According to a control signal delivered from the controller 120, the switching unit 200 delivers the broadcast signal received through the first tuner 102 and the second tuner 104 to one of the memory 130 and the A/V decoder 210.<br>
[0055]     The A/V decoder 210 decodes the broadcast signal delivered from the switching unit 200 and outputs the decoded signal through the display unit 140 and/or the speaker SPK. The A/V decoder 210 may be integrated with the audio processor 150 described above or separately equipped. Moreover, the switching unit 200 and the A/V decoder 210 may be implemented with hardware or software. Also,<br>
13<br><br>
the switching unit 200 and the A/V decoder 210 may be implemented with a dedicated processor or dedicated chip and integrated within the controller 120.<br>
[0056]     The controller 120 controls elements described above as well as the overall operation of the broadcast terminal 10. Accordingly, the operation of the broadcast terminal 10 according to one embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail with regard to the controller 120.<br>
[0057]      Preferably, the first tuner 102 receives first broadcast data from a first broadcast channel while the second tuner 104 receives second broadcast data from a second broadcast channel. Preferably, the first broadcast channel and the second broadcast channel have the same broadcasting standard and may be channels that broadcast different multimedia contents. The channels may be one of a video channel, an audio channel, and a data channel. For example, both the first broadcast channel and the second broadcast channel may be channels broadcasted under a terrestrial digital multimedia broadcasting (T-DMB) system, wherein the first broadcast channel is the video channel and the second broadcast channel is the audio channel.<br>
[0058]     Alternatively, the first broadcast channel and the second broadcast channel may be channels having different broadcasting standards. For example, the first broadcast channel may be a channel broadcasted under the T-DMB system while the second broadcast channel may be a channel broadcasted under a satellite digital multimedia broadcasting (S-DMB) system.<br>
[0059]      Fig. 3 illustrates a time relationship between a reception, storage, and playback of broadcast data received through two broadcast channels by a broadcast terminal in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. Referring to Figs. 1, 2a, 2b and 3, first broadcast data is received through the broadcasting reception module 100 and played (periods A, B and C of Fig. 3).<br>
14<br><br>
During playback of the first broadcast data, additional broadcast data may be received through at least one other broadcast channel. For example, second broadcast data may be received through a second broadcast channel. However, the second broadcast data cannot be played while the first broadcast data is played. Accordingly, during playback of the first broadcast data, the controller 120 controls the broadcast terminal to store the second broadcast data received through the second broadcast channel in the memory 130 (periods B and C of Fig. 3).<br>
[0060]      In accordance with the present invention, when a first broadcast channel is<br>
selected according to a command signal inputted through the input unit 110, the controller 120 controls the switching unit 200 to deliver first broadcast data received through the first tuner part 102 to the A/V decoder 210. The A/V decoder 210 then decodes the first broadcast data delivered from the switching unit 200 and reproduces it through the display unit 140 and/or the speaker SPK. For example, a news program such as "CNN" may be received from the first broadcast channel and reproduced through the display unit 140.<br>
[0061]      During playback of the first broadcast data, the controller 120 controls the<br>
switching unit 200 according to a command signal inputted through the input unit 110 to store in the memory 130 the second broadcast data received from the second broadcast channel through the broadcasting reception module 100. Preferably, the controller 120 activates the second tuner 104 according to the command signal. The activated second tuner 104 then receives the second broadcast data from the second broadcast channel and delivers it to the switching unit 200. The switching unit 200, under the control of the controller 120, delivers the received second broadcast data to the memory 130. The<br>
15<br><br>
memory 130 then stores the second broadcast data delivered from the switching unit 200.<br>
[0062]     Accordingly, during playback of the first broadcast data received from the first broadcast channel and displayed on the display unit 140, the second broadcast data, such as a drama "LOST II", which is received during playback of the first broadcast data, can be stored in the memory 130. Preferably, the second broadcast data is stored from a specific point in time, such as the start time of the drama "LOST II". When playback of the first broadcast data received from the first broadcast channel has ended, such as when the second broadcast channel is selected by the user, the controller 120 continues storing the received second broadcast data while simultaneously performing playback of the stored second broadcast data from a specific past time point (period D of Fig. 3).<br>
[0063]      Preferably, the controller 120 receives a command signal from the user through the input unit 110 to select the second broadcast channel. According to the command signal for selecting the second broadcast channel, the controller 120 decodes the second broadcast data stored in the memory 1301 via the A/V decoder 210 and plays it through the display unit 140 and/or the speaker SPK.<br>
[0064]      Notably, because the second broadcast data stored in the memory 130 is played by passing through the A/V decoder 210, a predetermined amount of time may elapse before the second broadcast data is played back when the controller 120 converts from the first broadcast channel to the second broadcast channel (period C of Fig. 3). Therefore, to minimize the time that elapses when converting from the first broadcast channel to the second broadcast channel, the controller 120 promptly decodes the second broadcast data stored in the memory 130 through the A/V decoder 210 for immediate playback.<br>
16<br><br>
[0065]      Preferably, while previously-stored second broadcast data is played back,<br>
second broadcast data newly received through the second tuner 104 may be continuously stored in the memory 130 via the switching unit 200. For example, the drama "LOST II" which is previously stored in the memory 130 may be played back from the start time through the display unit 140. Meanwhile, second broadcast data which is received on a real-time basis through the second tuner 104 may be continuously stored in the memory 130 during playback of the previously-stored data. Accordingly, the user is able to watch the news program "CNN", and still be able to watch the drama "LOST II" broadcasted during the same time in its entirety.<br>
[0066]      In accordance with the present invention, the specific past time point of when the broadcast data of the second broadcast channel is played back can be set or changed by the user according to various modes. Furthermore, the mode in which the broadcast data of the second broadcast channel stored in the memory 130 is played back from the specific past time point can be varied.<br>
[0067]      Fig. 2b is a block diagram illustrating a flow of a broadcast signal in a broadcast terminal in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention. As shown in Fig. 2b, the broadcasting reception module 100 differs from that of Fig. 2a.<br>
[0068]     The broadcast terminal 10 according to Figs. 1 and 2b comprises a<br>
broadcasting reception module 100', an input unit 110, a controller 120', a memory 130', a display unit 140, an audio processor 150, a mobile communications module 160, a switching unit 200' and an Audio/Video (A/V) decoder 210'. Hereinafter, a detailed description of elements except the broadcasting reception module 100' will be abbreviated since those are substantially similar to or identical with the elements of the broadcast terminal<br>
17<br><br>
10 according to the embodiment of the invention described above with reference to Fig. 1 and Fig. 2a.<br>
[0069]      As shown in Fig. 2b, the broadcasting reception module 100' receives broadcast signals broadcasted from a broadcasting center according to various types of digital broadcasting standards. Preferably, the broadcasting reception module 100' transmits a received broadcast signal to the controller 120' or other device.<br>
[0070]      The broadcasting reception module 100' comprises at least a first tuner 102 and a second tuner 104. Preferably, the broadcasting reception module 100' may simultaneously receive two broadcast signals through two different channels using the first tuner 102 and the second tuner 104, respectively. Hereinafter, using the broadcast terminal in accordance with the embodiment of the invention illustrated in Figs. 1 and 3, a method for playing back second broadcast data of the second broadcast channel according to various modes from a specific past time point will be exemplified.<br>
[0071]      Broadcast Reservation<br>
[0072]      Fig. 4 illustrates a time relationship between the reception, storage, and playback of broadcast data received through two broadcast channels in a broadcast terminal in accordance to one embodiment of the present invention, wherein a specific program of a second broadcast channel is reserved.<br>
[0073]      Referring to Figs. 1 and 4, the controller 120 stores reservation content of the second broadcast channel in the memory 130 when a playback period of a specific program of the second broadcast channel is reserved through the input unit 110. Here, the reservation content of the second broadcast channel may include broadcast channel information, a reservation time, broadcast channel program information, and other additional information. Preferably, the broadcast channel program information is provided from the broadcasting center through<br>
18<br><br>
the broadcasting reception module 100 periodically or non-periodically. Alternatively, the broadcast channel program information may be obtained from an electronic program guide (EPG), which may be downloaded from the wireless Internet using the mobile communications module 160.<br>
[0074]      In accordance with the present invention, if first broadcast data of the first broadcast channel is played back during the reservation time of the specific program of the second broadcast channel, the controller 120 controls the switching unit 200 as of the reservation time to store the second broadcast data received through the broadcasting reception module 100 in the memory 130 (period B of Fig. 4). For example, if the first broadcast data received from the first broadcast channel is played back during a time when a specific program (for example, "HOUSE") received from the second broadcast channel is reserved, the controller 120 stores "HOUSE" as of the reserved time in the memory 130 while continuing playback of the first broadcast data.<br>
[0075]     As explained above, when playback of the first broadcast data has ended and conversion from the first broadcast channel to the second broadcast channel takes place, the controller 120 continues storing the received second broadcast data and plays back the stored second broadcast data as of the beginning of the reservation time (period C of Fig. 4). Accordingly, although the user watches a specific program of the first broadcast channel during the reservation time of "HOUSE" of the second broadcast channel, the user can watch "HOUSE" in its entirety and not from a middle portion of the program. Moreover, the user can immediately watch "HOUSE" after playback of the first broadcast data has ended without having to first record "HOUSE" from its beginning to end.<br>
[0076]     Fig. 5 illustrates a time relationship between the reception, storage, and playback of broadcast data received through two broadcast channels in a<br>
19<br><br>
broadcast terminal in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, wherein specific programs of a first and second broadcast channel are reserved, respectively.<br>
[0077]     Referring to Figs. 1-3 and 5, the controller 120 stores reservation content of the first and second broadcast channels in the memory 130 when a playback period of a specific program of the first and second broadcast channels is respectively reserved through the input unit 110. In accordance with the present invention, the controller 120 initially plays first broadcast data of the first broadcast channel during the reservation time of the specific program of the first broadcast channel. However, it is contemplated that the controller may first play second broadcast data of the second broadcast channel during the reservation time of the specific program of the second broadcast channel.<br>
[0078]     Accordingly, if the first broadcast data of the first broadcast channel is initially played, but during the reservation time of the specific program of the second broadcast channel, the controller 120 controls the switching unit 200 as of the reservation time to store the second broadcast data received through the broadcasting reception module 100 in the memory 130. At the end of the reservation time of the first broadcast channel, the controller 120 continues storing the automatically received second broadcast data and plays back the stored second broadcast data as of the specific past time point, that is, from the beginning of the reservation time.<br>
[0079]      In accordance with the present invention, the order in which playback periods are respectively reserved on the first broadcast channel and second broadcast channel can vary. If the respective reservation times of the first and the second broadcast channel overlap, the functions of the broadcast terminal 10 according to the preferred embodiments of the present invention are performed.<br>
20<br><br>
Preferably, the controller 120 may output information related to the overlap between the respective reservation times of the first and second broadcast channels through the display unit 140 and/or the speaker SPK. For example, the controller 120 may display information indicating the overlap between the respective reservation programs via a pop-up window on the display unit 140. Accordingly, the user may be asked whether to continue with the reservation setting in view of the overlap.<br>
[0080]      Fig. 6 illustrates a time relationship between the reception, storage, and<br>
playback of broadcast data received through three broadcast channels in a broadcast terminal in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, wherein specific programs of the three broadcast channels are reserved, respectively.<br>
[0081]      Referring to Figs. 1-3 and 6, the controller 120 stores reservation content of the first and second broadcast channels in the memory 130 when a playback period of a specific program of an X broadcast channel and a Y broadcast channel is respectively reserved through the input unit 110. Here, the X broadcast channel and the Y broadcast channel may be included in both the first broadcast channel and the second broadcast channel.<br>
[0082]      Notably, there is no overlap between reservation times of the X broadcast<br>
channel and the Y broadcast channel included in the first broadcast channel and a reservation time of the first broadcast channel. Accordingly, the process illustrated in Fig. 3 may be applied. Moreover, if reservation times of only two channels (X broadcast channel and Y broadcast channel) overlap among the first broadcast channel, then the process illustrated in Fig. 4 may be applied.<br>
[0083]     However, in a time region where reservation times of all three channels among the first broadcast channel, the X broadcast channel and the Y broadcast<br>
21<br><br>
channel at least partially overlap, then the process illustrated in Fig. 6 may be applied. Referring to Fig. 6, a part of the reservation time point of the first broadcast channel and the X broadcast channel overlap, while a part of the reservation time point of the X broadcast channel and the Y broadcast channel overlap.<br>
[0084]     As shown, the controller 120 plays first broadcast data of the first broadcast<br>
channel during the reservation time of the specific program of the first broadcast channel. If the first broadcast data is played during the reservation time of the specific program of the X broadcast channel, the controller 120 controls the switching unit 200 as of the reservation time to store X broadcast data received through the broadcasting reception module 100 in the memory 130.<br>
[0085]      Accordingly, if the reservation time point of the specific program of the Y<br>
broadcast channel is reached before the first broadcast channel is converted to the X broadcast channel, the controller 120 continues storing the received X broadcast data while also storing Y broadcast data received from the Y broadcast channel in the memory 130. Hence, the broadcast terminal 10 receives three sets of broadcast data received from the first, X, and Y broadcast channels, respectively. Therefore, the broadcasting reception module 100 requires at least three tuners. Moreover, the broadcast terminal 10 has the data structure, type, or number of the memory that can simultaneously store two sets of broadcast data received from the X and Y broadcast channels. For example, one memory 130 can be partitioned into two or more storage compartments to respectively store data from two or more broadcast channels.<br>
[0086]      At the end of the reservation time of the first broadcast channel, the controller 120 continues storing the automatically received X broadcast data and plays back the stored X broadcast data as of the specific past time point, that is, from<br>
22<br><br>
the beginning of the reservation time of the X broadcast channel. During this time, the controller 120 continues storing the broadcast data received from Y broadcast channel.<br>
[0087]     At the end of the reservation time of the X broadcast channel, the controller 120 continues storing the automatically received Y broadcast data and plays back the stored Y broadcast data from the specific past time point, that is, from the beginning of the reservation time of the Y broadcast channel. As a result, in spite of three program playback periods on three broadcast channels being at least partially overlapped, all programs reserved using the broadcast terminal 10 can be watched in their entirety.<br>
[0088]     Playback Mode of Broadcast Data<br>
[0089]      Figs. 7a to 7e illustrate display screens in which broadcast data of a first broadcast channel and a second broadcast channel are played back in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. Referring to Fig. 7a, the controller 120 may control playback of the first broadcast data such that the first broadcast data is outputted on a definite region or distinguished region of the display unit 140.<br>
[0090]      For example, as described above with reference to Figs. 4 to (3, when a<br>
reservation time of the second broadcast channel is reached during playback of the first broadcast data received from the first broadcast channel, the second broadcast data received from the second broadcast channel can be stored in the memory 130. Here, the first broadcast data may be indicated on the display unit 140 through the process illustrated above. If a user wishes to play back the first broadcast data on a portion of the display unit 140 from a specific past time point, that is, from a reservation time, if necessary, while regenerating the second broadcast data into a part of a screen from the reservation time on a<br>
23<br><br>
real-time basis, the first broadcast data and the second broadcast data can be displayed on the same screen at the same time. Preferably, the magnitude of the playback region or the region of the first broadcast channel and the second broadcast channel can be variously controlled.<br>
[0091]      Furthermore, regardless of the reservation, the controller 120 can discontinue playback of one broadcast data when two broadcast data received from two broadcast channels are played back on the same screen at the same time. Accordingly, the broadcast data can be stored from the point of discontinued playback.<br>
[0092]      Accordingly, the user can perform storage of various other channels and<br>
playback from the specific past time point. Referring to Figs. 7b and 7c, the controller 120 may control playback of the second broadcast data received from the second broadcast channel such that the second broadcast data is played back in a definite region or distinguished region on a real-time basis during playback of the stored second broadcast data (past playback) on the display unit 140. Preferably, the controller 120 may control the region size of the past playback and the real-time playback of the second broadcast data to be a small screen and a large screen. For example, in case the user wishes to repeatedly watch a previous goal scene of soccer game, past playback can be performed along with real-time playback.<br>
[0093]      Referring to Fig. 7d, if the display unit 140 can display an image with a screen where the width is longer than the length, the controller 120 may play back the second broadcast data received from the second broadcast channel on a realtime basis along with the past playback content on the display unit 140. Referring to Fig. 7e, the controller 120 may play back first broadcast data received from the first broadcast channel on a real-time basis simultaneously<br>
24<br><br>
with second broadcast data received from the second broadcast channel on a real-time basis. Alternatively, the real-time first broadcast data may be simultaneously displayed with stored second broadcast data (past playback). Moreover, although it is not exemplified in detail, various playback methods of the broadcast data according to various combinations of Figs. 7a to 7e are contemplated.<br>
[0094]      Figs. 8a and 8b illustrate display screens which indicate the storage of second broadcast channel data during playback of first broadcast channel data in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. Referring to Fig. 8a, during playback of the first broadcast data, the controller 120 displays at least one of the second broadcast data storage of the second broadcast channel or the program information on a part of the region where the first broadcast data of the first broadcast channel is played back or on a distinguished region.<br>
[0095]      Referring to Fig. 8b, the controller 120 displays at least one of the second broadcast data storage of the second broadcast channel or the program information via a pop-up window. Accordingly, a user visibly knows that the second broadcast data is being stored in the broadcast terminal 10. Thus, the user can comfortably watch playback of the first broadcast data. Moreover, although not illustrated in the drawing, a controller may preferably store the second broadcast data of the second broadcast channel in the memory 130 from a specific time, such as half an hour from the end of the first broadcast data transmission on the first broadcast channel. Accordingly, the second broadcast data can be played back from the specific storage time point when the second broadcast channel is selected.<br>
[0096]      Preferably, the controller 120 may repeatedly reserve broadcast data playback periods of the first and second broadcast channels with a uniform period. For<br>
25<br><br>
example, the controller 120 can periodically reserve and play back, on a weekly basis and at a specific time from Monday to Friday, the overlapped portion of two broadcast data received from two broadcast channels, respectively. Preferably, the period may be set by day, week, month, and year, or any combination thereof, for example. Accordingly, playback periods of broadcast programs that start at a specific time before the end of a specific program can periodically be reserved so that a user can watch the programs in their entirety.<br>
[0097]      In accordance with the present invention, the controller 120, being combined with the method or the process described above, can control the speed of playback from the past time point according to various modes. Furthermore, the controller 120 may delete from the memory 130 content already played back to effectively utilize storage space.<br>
[0098]     Also, before playback of the second broadcast data, the controller 120 queries the user whether the second broadcast data of the second broadcast channel is played back from the past time point or on a real-time basis. If the former is selected, the second broadcast data of the second broadcast channel is played back from the past time point. [0099]      Broadcast Data Playback Method<br>
[00100]      Fig, 9 is a flowchart of a broadcast data playback method of a broadcast<br>
terminal in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. Referring to Figs. 4 and 9, a broadcast data playback method will be described in detail.<br>
[00101]      First, the first broadcast data received from the first broadcast channel is played back [S500, period A of Fig. 4]. For example, a user may watch a program through the first broadcast channel. A reservation time of the second broadcast channel is then determined during playback of the received first broadcast data [S510]. For example, a user reserves a specific program through the second<br>
26<br><br>
broadcast channel. Accordingly, when the reservation time of the specific program is reached during playback of the first broadcast data through the first broadcast channel, playback of the specific program through the second broadcast channel will begin. Here, the detailed description on the first broadcast channel and the second broadcast channel is as described above.<br>
[00102]     In accordance with the present invention, if the reservation time of the second broadcast channel is determined, the first broadcast data is received from the first broadcast channel and played back. During this time, the second broadcast data received from the second broadcast channel may be stored [S520, period B of Fig. 4].<br>
[00103]      Furthermore, during playback of the received first broadcast data, it is<br>
determined whether the second broadcast channel is to be selected [S530, period B of Fig. 4], For example, a command signal for selecting the second broadcast channel may be received from a user. That is, the user previously watching a broadcast through the first broadcast channel indicates that he wishes to watch a broadcast through the second broadcast channel. Notably, in accordance with the present invention, determining whether the second broadcast channel is to be selected is not strictly dependent on a user command signal.<br>
[00104]     If is determined that the second broadcast channel is to be selected, then while continuing the storage of the received second broadcast data, the previously stored second broadcast data is played back as of a past time point or the beginning of the reservation time [S540, period C of Fig. 4]. Afterward, the played second broadcast data may be deleted. Thus, memory capacity is saved and effectively utilized.<br>
27<br><br>
[00105]     Fig. 10 is a flowchart of a broadcast data playback method of a broadcast terminal in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention. Referring to Fig. 10, steps S500', S510', S520’, S530' of the broadcast data playback method are substantially the same as steps S500, S510, S520, S530, respectively, of the broadcast data playback method of Fig. 9. Therefore, their detailed description will be omitted.<br>
[00106]      Here, the function of storing the second broadcast data during the reservation time may terminate or end. Thus, when the second broadcast channel is determined to be selected (S5301), the stored second broadcast data may be played back from the past time point or the beginning of the reservation time.<br>
[00107]     Fig. 11 is a flowchart of a broadcast data playback method of a broadcast terminal in accordance with a further embodiment of the present invention. Referring to Figs. 5 and 11, the broadcast data playback method will be described in detail.<br>
[00108]      First, it is determined whether a first broadcast channel reservation time exists [S590]. If the first broadcast channel reservation time is determined to exist, then first broadcast data received from the first broadcast channel is played [S600]. For example, the user may watch a broadcast program through the first broadcast channel.<br>
[00109]      During playback of the received first broadcast data, it is determined whether a second broadcast channel reservation time exists [S610]. If the second broadcast channel reservation time is determined to exist, the first broadcast data continues to be received from the first broadcast channel and played. At the same time, second broadcast data received from the second broadcast channel is stored [S620, period B of Fig. 5].<br>
28<br><br>
[00110]      Additionally, during playback of the received first broadcast data, it is determined whether a first broadcast channel reservation time period has ended or terminated [S630]. If it is determined that the first broadcast channel reservation time has ended or terminated, then the playback of the first broadcast data is ended or terminated [S635]. Thereafter, the previously stored second broadcast data is played while continuing to store newly received second broadcast data [S640, period C of Fig. 5]. Afterward, the played second broadcast data may be deleted.<br>
[00111]      Fig. 12 is a flowchart of a broadcast data playback method of a broadcast terminal in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention. Referring to Fig. 12, steps S590', S6001, S6101, S620', S5301 and S635' of the broadcast data playback method are substantially the same as the steps S590, S600, S610, S620, S630 and S635, respectively, of Fig. 11. Therefore, their detailed description will be omitted.<br>
[00112]      Accordingly, after playback of the first broadcast data is terminated, and if the second broadcast channel reservation time has ended or terminated, then any stored second broadcast data is played back from a past time point or the beginning of the reservation time [S6401]. Consequently, the step S640' is different from the step S640 of Fig. 11 in that the second broadcast data received through the second broadcast channel is no longer continuously stored because the second broadcast channel reservation time is presently terminated.<br>
[00113]      The embodiments of the invention were illustrated as described; however, they are not limited to those scopes. In the embodiments described above, various broadcast channel conversion modes according to a selection command inputted through the input unit or by the broadcast reservation was illustrated. However, the broadcast channel conversion mode of the present invention is not<br>
29<br><br>
limited thereto. For example, after storing the second broadcast data according to a user command during the playback of the first broadcast data, second broadcast data stored from a next storage time point or from a specific time point after the storage time point can be played. In another example, with regard to generating specific channel broadcast data, when the generation of the specific channel broadcast data is terminated after a store command is inputted for another channel, the specific channel broadcast data may be generated again from the storing point of the other channel's broadcast data.<br>
[00114]      Furthermore, in the embodiments described above, the mode in which the first and the second broadcast data are simultaneously played on a main screen and a sub-screen, respectively, in a real-time or non-real-time basis was exemplified; however, the invention is not restricted thereto. For example, three different sets of broadcast data may be played on the same screen according to various combinations in a real-time or non-real-time basis.<br>
[00115]     The foregoing embodiments and advantages are merely exemplary and are not to be construed as limiting the present invention. The present teaching can be readily applied to other types of apparatuses. The description of the present invention is intended to be illustrative, and not to limit the scope of the claims. Many alternatives, modifications, and variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art.
