				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a vertical axis wind turbine comprising of at least one rotor-blade with aerofoil like cross section.<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART<br>
Vertical axis wind turbine as compared to horizontal axis wind turbine has the advantage that the adjustment in the direction of the wind is not required. The rotor blades exhibit an invariable cross section without any distortion and can be held at more points/spots. But then till date horizontal axis wind turbine are preferred, as they have higher efficiency and are more adoptable to the wind velocity whereas Vertical axis wind turbines' performance decline beyond a limited range. Also there is some problem with the starting of Vertical axis wind turbine. Therefore there have been many efforts to solve the problem of the starting of Vertical axis wind turbine and also to make possible the control of rotor blades.<br>
Rotors with rotor blades whose angle of pitch/incidence vis-a-vis their bearing rods can be regulated by a steering gear during each rotation as suggested in DE - OS 43 05 600, have very complicated mechanism and have very high wear and tear of bearings.<br>
That is why according to DE - OS 3626217 a movable - mechanism is avoided. The starting of Vertical axis wind turbine may be eased by developing surface tide on the external surface of the rotor blades. Generation of effective surface tide result in complicated blades which on one side cause the rotation but at the same time limit the efficiency of the turbine. Till now the solution for this has been the use of cross sectional type of the rotor blades. But at the same time we have to turn over the eyes from surface tide as well as the condition of the rotor blades at rotor gear rods. They have an aerofoil like cross section and are either axis - parallel or are arranged in angle with the rotor axis. They may be called as an externally directed V- form or as Darrieus - rotor, which is externally - curved form (snow-broom) form. In each case the rotor blades are radially upright.<br>
This construction of Vertical axis wind turbine, which consumes high energy, has to explain many things. Also they must be able to self start and easily controllable.<br>
STATEMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to the present invention, there is provided a vertical axis wind turbine comprising at least one rotor blade (7) with aerofoil like cross-section wherein the rotor blade (7) is curved or bent in the direction of rotation such that at least one end of the rotor blade (7) vis-a-vis a medium domain of the rotor blade is replaced in the direction of rotation.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a vertical axis wind turbine comprising at least one rotor blade (7) with aerofoil like cross-section wherein the rotor blade (7) is curved or bent in the direction of rotation such that at least one end of the rotor blade (7) vis-a-vis a medium domain of the rotor blade is replaced in the direction of rotation.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the rotor blade (7) is bent in the form of an arc.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the rotor blade (7) is curved into v shape.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the rotor blade (7) is curved at multiple locations along its length.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the deviation or the curving of the rotor blade (7) along its length is asymmetric.<br>
In one more embodiment of the present invention, the vertex or the main curving point lies vertically in an upper half of the horizontal centre of gravity of the rotor blade (7).<br>
In one another embodiment of the present invention, the rotor blade (7) is curved at least at one point along a perpendicular direction of the driving axis of the vertical axis wind turbine.<br>
In a further embodiment of the present invention, the bending is exchangeable with a hinge-connected part of the rotor blade (7) and a regulating mechanism.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the rotor blade (7) is bent concave at least in one part of the operation at the driving axis (10) of the vertical axis wind turbine.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the angle of a rotor blade (7) is regulated vis-a-vis / around its linkage gear (8) with the help of steering and holding rod (11).<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the rotor blade (7) is composed of several module type parts.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the module type parts are made up of compact impulsive sections.<br>
In one more embodiment of the present invention, the rotor blade (7) is supported by an inner bearing shaft and the outer impulsive sections are fixed on it.<br>
In one another embodiment of the present invention, the vertical axes wind turbine has a single layered gear-box.<br>
In a further embodiment of the present invention, the vertical axis wind turbine has a gear-less generator.<br>
It is important to note that the rotor blades bend or curve in their orbit of rotation, such that the end of rotor blades with respect to the medium range of the rotor<br>
blades are replaced in their orbit of rotation. The bending can either be curved type or V type and can exhibit one or more coil wrenched marks. Asymmetrical type bends are preferred, where it is advantageous when there is a form in which the vertex or the main curving point lie in vertical direction or in a horizontal line of the centre of gravity of the rotor blades.<br>
In a preferred form , the rotor blades can be so arranged that rotor blades at least at one place is curved along intersecting vertical - line in the direction of the axis of deviation of vertical axis wind turbine. Such resulting movement of the rotor blade can be the secants or tangents to rotation of the rotor blades, According to a variant construction, the curves are exchangeable with a high - type construction of parts of rotor blades and an adjustable mechanism, so that the speed of rotation or braking of the wind turbine is possible with the help of angle -adjustment.<br>
Instead of curving, the rotor blade may be a continuous concave bend in relation to the axis of deviation. With this final bending, the efficiency is increased with respect to the wind velocity.<br>
The rotor blade arrangement as instructed in the construction has the advantage that the tangential power of the rotor blade which remains twice zero during each rotation, also at the point of steam turning it is maintained at a low value.<br>
In total, the air resistance is negligible. Also the radial load - structures are diminished by the steam turning. Considerable high efficiency is obtained by the aero - dynamic edge and power circulation.<br>
Further, one or more rotor blades are arranged as rotating along an imaginary axis which instead of the rotor blade at two points where a linkage gear fixed ; so that the angle of pitch (incidence) of the axis is individually adjusted. A cyclic rotor blade adjustment as contrary does not take care of this. The self- start of the<br>
rotor is possible by adjustment of at least one blade. Till now the available braking is not operative in the initial phase.<br>
In operational field, the efficiency can be controlled by the adjustment of the number of rotation. With the help of construction instructions and the adjustment possibility the domain of fast rotation, in which the wind turbine is under efficient, can be further expanded. Disconnection with storm is also possible through the adjustment, by which the Rotor blades are placed loose in the wind (Flag-placement).<br>
In the profitable type, the Rotor blades may be composed of many modules, which do the production beneficially in extrusion molding. The aerodynamic profile is preferably symmetric, but as described can be unsymmetrical also. The Rotor<br>
t<br>
blades module can also be constructed with an inner supporting shaft and outer opened plastic aerodynamic profiles.<br>
The Rotor can work with a single layered gear and a generator or also directly with a gearless Generator. Also the multiple arrangement of generator gives the opportunity to work with changing efficiency with respect to changing intensity of the wind and also to completely utilize the partial load domain (ca. 3-15 m/s) of the wind velocity. With that the generators exhibit different rated output in order to exploit the widened domain of the wind-velocity.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
The construction can be explained by the model. In the attached figures: Figure 1: shows a vertical axis wind energy plant after the construction. Figure 2: side-view of Rotor blade after the construction. Figure 3: Plan-view of a Rotor blade after the construction.<br>
Figure 4: Power-production by Known Rotor blades in domain of steam- turning.<br>
Figure 5: power production by a Rotor blade after the construction in domain of stem turning.<br>
Figure 1 shows a vertical axis wind energy plant for net-parallel operation. The Rotor is made up of 3 similar Rotor blades (7). The Rotor blades (7) are fixed from a linkage- gear (8) and are connected to a driving oscillation (10).<br>
It is especially evident from Figure 2 that the Rotor blades 7 form an upper half of an imagined unsymmetrical trapezium. This upper half above the main bending point of the Rotor blades 7 makes an angle between 30 and 45° with the vertical and the lower part makes an angle between 15 and 30°.<br>
As shown in Figure 3 the plan-view of the Rotor blades 7 along the vertical, which is suspended from the linking point 9, is angled such that they are tangential to the rotating path.<br>
The Rotor blades 7 as seen by the last angle have a symmetric profile 12 with uniform cross-section. They are made up of 5 modules 13-17 which are firmly connected with each other by welding. The modules 13-17 are supported by an inner supporting shaft, an aluminum profile and plastic covers, which produce in centrism molding. The Rotor blades 7 are movable at the point of attachment with the help of gearing rods 8 between the top of each Rotor blades 7 and a central oscillating junction. An arrangement (11) for connecting the central junction of the rotor blade with a driving oscillation (10) undertakes that the driving power is aerodynamically suitably installed. In a free standing tower 2 stratified domain 6 of driving oscillation 10 is carried till under-half of the Rotor and the gear-wheel of a gear box is coupled there. Here it is related to the working of a single-layered gearbox with a big impulsive tooth-ring 4 and corresponding small pinion 5. The gear box works with two generators 3,3a. The free standing tower 2 has no relaxation.<br>
In the starting phase the Rotor blades 7 are so adjusted with the help of controlling mechanism to their momentary positions that each exhibits optimal angle. During peak rotations the adjustment is further expanded. At the rated speed, the rotor blades 7 are tangential till certain temperature (maximum ca.10), which suits their position with respect to the cycle of rotation. The efficiency and the rotating regulations happen with the corresponding formation of the stream angle.<br>
For storm-disconnection the Rotor blades 7 are rotated to the flag position. In partial load operation the control mechanism adjusts the Rotor for maximum efficiency. By diminishing wind velocity the plant operates with generator 3, the second generator 3 a is shut by high wind velocity. Both generators 3 and 3 a can exhibit different rated speed in order to enable the plant in total to control in an expanded domain of the wind-velocity.<br>
With the given construction it is possible to bring the principle advantages of the vertical axis wind turbines in operation. It consists of the advantageous wind power plant, independence from the wind direction, the simple and cheap manufacture of Rotor blades and the gear box construction at low cost and damage. The high operational security and lower maintenance expenses with multiple blade suspensions add to the advantage. With that the use of wind-energy is made more economical. With lowering expenses the adaptation of the plant at shores and at inland is made possible.<br>
Figure 4 shows the power production by conventional Rotor blades in domain of a stream charge i.e. when the Rotor blades are adjusted parallel to wind direction (90,270). Also shown is the radial force (fr) and the tangential force (ft) the rotation of the Rotor causes the tangential force to lower to 0 from 90 and again it causes the angle to increase. They can be considered as acting in negative operation with respect to the starting of the plant. That means that they cause breaking. As the Rotor blades experience a radial force (fr) by 90, there is zero<br>
transit with highly increasing angle. It also acts as an abrupt load-change in the pressure domain.<br>
On the contrary figure 5 shows the power production by constructed Rotor blades. The tangential force (ft) does not get lowered to zero. The deviation of the tangential force (ft) along the rotation is comparable. Also a reduction in the radial structural load comes into play, as the passage of pressure in the traction is essentially slowed.<br>
