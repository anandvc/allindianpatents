Tne spinning machine is fitted with a compacting device ' which is connected to a drafting arrangement 1a of the spinning machine and is characterised by an additional guide 34 for the sfiver which is arranged in the direction of transport of the siiver after a drafting zone 4, 5 and before a compacting zone, especially before the sliver 11 is wound on a compacting element 19 of the compacting device.<br>
Said machine can be further characterised in<br>
that the guide 34 is arranged in the main drafting zone of a multi-stage drafting arrangement before the delivery cylinder 2.<br>
tnat the auide element 34 of the auide is a onsmatic rod arranaed in the longitudinal direction of the drafting cyiince". having a cross-section rounded on the functional side-that the guide element 34 is a;ranged so that it is passed through a connecting iine or tangent tc a gripping gap 23 between a delivery cylinder 2 and a top roller 2' pressed against said cylinder and the delivery gripping point between a top apron 5 and bottom apron 4 o* the drafting arrangement 1a,<br>
that the sliver 11 or apron 5 is deflected by a few degrees, especially 1.5...6Â°,<br><br>
that the guide sits directly in front of the gripping gap 23 between the delivery cylinder 2 and a third top rciier 2' of the drafting arrangement pressed against said cylinder<br>
that if necessary, the deliver/ cylinder 2 of the draftinc arranaement 12 is embodied as a compacting siement 19 of a compacting device 1 with an air-permeable cylindrical surface.<br>
that aerodynamic effects car: be triggered on the sliver 11 in a compaction zone 13 by a vacuum system 15<br>
that the guide element 34 is affixed by means of retaining elements 340 to retaining parts for aprons, especially a cage 30 for an apron 4. 5 of the drafting arrangement 1a,<br>
that leaf springs are attachec at the ends of a guide element 34, with a snap connection at the ends of a caae 30 for an aoron 5 of the draftinc arranaement la,<br>
that a guide 34 for s sliver 11 sits on one edge of the cage 30 at a spacer 32 with a deflecting element 33 on one edge of s cage 30 for a :op apron 5 of the drafting arranaement la.<br>
that a guide 34 is provided before the delivery cylinder 2 of the drafting arrangement 1a and a further guide 34' is provided after the delivery cylinder 2 and before a compacting device 1 with a compacting element 19, considered in each case in the direction of transport of s silver 11 through the drafting arrangement 1a,<br>
wherein the afore-mentioned features can be applied singly or cumulatively<br><br>
The drafting arrangement la comprising the compacting device 1 as shown in Figure 1 transports a sliver 11 oyer a feed cylinder 42 with a first top roller 42' pressed against said cylinder through a preliminary drafting zone to a middle cylinder 3 with a second top roller 3'. The middle cylinder 3 has a bottom apron 4 looped around it, whichr driver by the middle cylinder, passes ever a bridge 40. The top roller 3' with a top apron 5 and a cage 30 is pressed against the bottom apron 4 oy means of a loading device 10 as shown in Figure 4. The top apron 5 is dnven in contact with said bottom apron 3 by saic bottom apron, wherein the fibres of the sliver 11 brought from the preliminary drafting zone between the feed cylinder 42 and middle cylinder 3 are retained in the main drafting zone against the tension of the delivery cylinder 2. In this exemplary embodiment the delivery cylinder 2 is embodied as a compacting element 19, I.e. as a perforated drum with internal suction. The top apron 5 on the one hand loops around the second top roller 3\ and on the other hand around a spacer 32 which sits on the cage 30. A guide element 34 is arranged between the delivery position of the sliver 1 1 from the bottom apron 4 or top apron 3 and the delivery cylinder 2 with the third top roller 2\ which slightly deflects the sliver 11 as shown in Figure 1 whereby taut guidance of the fibres of the sliver 11 is achieved and in particular shorter fibres are preventec from becoming detached from the sliver A round bar especially having a diameter between 3 and 6 mm is preferably used as the guide element 34. The guide element 3-is arranged as close as possible to the surface of the delivery cylinder 2 or the compacting element 19. with a distance of less than 1 mm. After being deflected by the guide element 34 by a few degrees, the sliver is wound onto the surface of the compacting element 1S: the looping path between the gripping position of the third top roller 2 and the fourth top roller T lying en the compacting element 19. A screen 19' over the compacting element 19 ensures that the incoming suction air is guided as parallel as possible io the axis of the delivery cylinder 2. The sliver is then preferably twisted by means of a ring spinning device 40 and wound onto a yam bobbin.<br>
Figures 2 and 2a show enlarged sections of the device in the vicinity of the guide 34 where the sliver 11 is deflected by the angle a = 1.5...6Â°. Yarns can be spun in counts of Ne 3 to 100, preferably 3...50,.especially 3 to 30 with preferably a single adjustment of<br><br>
the guide element of the guide 34. The feed can consist of all known spinnabie fibre materials, also having a short-fibre ~rac:ion, especially carded cotton, also MMF, PES and blends. Good yam qualities are achieved thanks to The guide 34. The reference numbers In Figures 2 and 2a are similar tc those in Figure 1.<br>
Figure 3 shows two embodiments for fixing the guide 34 in the drafting arrangement. The cage 30 for guiding the top apron 5 is mounted fixedly but pivotally with the second top roller 3' on the afore-mentioned loading device 10. In the first exemplary embodiment of the guide element of the guide 34, this extends over the entire length of a section of the cage 30 in Figure 3. The ends of the guide element 34 are held by retaining elements 340, 340'. The retaining elements 34G are attached fixedly at the ends of the cage 30, for example, using fixing elements 342 in the form of pins or screws. The retaining elements 340 can be made of spring steel, as leaf springs for example. They can be snapped by means of fixing oins 342 laterally into holes in the ends of the cage when the fixing elements 342 are aligned.<br>
According tc a second exemplar/ embodiment of the guide 34 in the right-hand part of Figure 3, a comparatively short guide element 34 is positioned on the right longitudinal edge of the cage 30 at a spacer 32 by means of two retaining elements 340, 3401 having gliders 342 at their ends. The gliders 342 in this case sit directly next to the gliders 320 of the spacer 32, The spacer is used tc guide the top apron 5: this being-deflected by the deflecting etemern 33 between the gliders 320. The gliders 342 can be executed like the gliders 32C of the spacer, shown in perspective view, with a larger distance between the gliders 342 than between the gliders 320. A retaining element 340 sits with the glider 342 next TO the spacer 32 on the cage 30 as shown in Figure 3. Next to the cage 30, the spacer 32 is shown in perspective view and the short guide element 34 with-the retaining elements 340 is shown in perspective/schematic view. As has already been mentioned, the guide element of the guide 34 is a preferably circular-cylindrical prismatic element. The guide 34 can also be affixed directly on the deflecting element 33.<br><br><br><br>
cylinders 2, 2' and the delivery-sice gripping point of the pair of aprons 4, 5 passes partly through the guide element 34.<br>
The surface condition of the deflection or guidance shouid be selected according to the desired effect or raw materia!. The deflection can be mounted fixedly or rotatabiy. The guide element 34 can also be affixed to the deflecting bridge 40.<br>
As shown in Fig. 5, the guice 34 can be curved concavely towards the delivery cylinder 2, 2' and convexly towards the sliver 11.<br>
As shown in Fig. 6, the guide 34 can be arranged between two top rollers 2\ 3' with respect to the apron 5 so that this undergoes a concave deflection by the guide 34 when viewed from outside. It is thereby possible to bring the apron closer to the top roller T whereby the sliver 11 is guided if not additionally, thus over a longer section.<br>
According to Figs. 2 and 4. the additional guide 34 for the sliver is arranged in the direction of transport of the silver in or after a drafting zone 4. 5 and before a compacting zone, especially before the sliver 11 is wound on the compacting element 19 of the compacting device.<br>
According to rig. 7, the guide 34 can be affixed on axles of top rollers 2', 2 using retaining elements 340a and 340c or on a loading arm 344.<br>
