It has surprisingly been found that the compounds of general formula I are metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonists. Compounds of formula I are distinguished by valuable therapeutic properties.<br>
In the central nervous system (CNS) the transmission of stimuli takes place by the interaction of a neurotransmitter, which is sent out by a neuron, with a neuroreceptor.<br>
L-glutamic acid, the most commonly occurring neurotransmitter in the CNS, plays a critical role in a large number of physiological processes. The glutamate-dependent stimulus receptors are divided into two main groups. The first main group forms ligand-controlled ion channels. The metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR) form the second main group and, furthermore, belong to the family of G-protein-coupled receptors.<br>
At present, eight different members of these mGluR are known and of these some even have sub-types. On the basis of structural parameters, the different influences on the synthesis of secondary metabolites and the different affinity to low-molecular weight<br><br>
chemical compounds, these eight receptors can be subdivided into three sub-groups: mGluRl and mGluR5 belong to group I, mGluR2 and mGluR3 belong to group II and mGluR4, mGluR6, mGluR7 and mGluR8 belong to group III.<br>
Ligands of metabotropic glutamate receptors belonging to the group II can be used for the treatment or prevention of acute and/or chronic neurological disorders such as psychosis, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, cognitive disorders and memory deficits.<br>
Other treatable indications in this connection are restricted brain function caused by bypass operations or transplants, poor blood supply to the brain, spinal cord injuries, head injuries, hypoxia caused by pregnancy, cardiac arrest and hypoglycaemia. Further treatable indications are chronic and acute pain, Huntington's chorea, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), dementia caused by AIDS, eye injuries, retinopathy, idiopathic parkinsonism or parkinsonism caused by medicaments as well as conditions which lead to glutamate-deficiency functions, such as e.g. muscle spasms, convulsions, migraine, urinary incontinence, nicotine addiction, opiate addiction, anxiety, vomiting, dyskinesia and depressions.<br>

The compounds of general formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be manufactured according to the following methods:<br><br>
Scheme A<br><br>
Compounds of general formula I, in which R1, R3 and X are as described above can be prepared according to scheme A, by, for example, cleaving the BOC protecting group in compounds of general formula II, and concomitant cyciization of the deprotected compound. The deprotection-cyclization step can be carried out by treating the compounds of general formula II with a bronsted acid, like for example trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), in an inert solvent, like for example dichloromethane (DCM). The reaction is preferably carried out at temperatures between 0 °C and 50 °C It may be advantageous to use also anisole or 1,3-dimethoxybenzene as a carbocation scavenger in the reaction mixture. Any other suitable amino protecting group, such as e.g. Fmoc or benzyloxycarbonyl (Z), can be alternatively used instead of the BOC group.<br>
Scheme B<br><br>
Compounds of general formula II, in which R1, R3 and X are as described above, can be prepared according to scheme B by for example reacting a compound of general formula III with a dioxinone (general formula IV) in an inert solvent like for example toluene or xylene at elevated temperatures, preferably between 80 °C and 160 °C.<br>
Alternatively, compounds of general formula II can also be prepared by for example reaction of a compound of general formula III with a fi-ketoester (general formula IVa), in which R3 is as described above using the same conditions as described for the reaction with the dioxinones.<br><br><br>
According to scheme C, compounds of general formula III in which Rl is as described above for compounds where X is a single bond can be prepared by different routes from the iodo-compound IX, depending on the nature of Rl. As shown in scheme C, the key steps are coupling reactions of Suzuki- and Stille-type in presence or absence of carbonmonoxide. The exact conditions for the respective compounds can be found in the experimental part.<br><br><br>
GP A, method a: diphosgene, EtOAc, 77 °C; then t-BuOH GP A, method b: Boc^O, Cs2C03&gt; 2-butanone, 52 °C<br>
GP A, method c: i) Boc^O, DMAP, THF; H) TFA, DCM, 0 °C<br>
According to scheme D, the key intermediate iodide IX can be prepared from commercially available 2-nitroaniline by a standard iodination-protection sequence.<br><br>
According to scheme E, compounds of general formula Ilia in which R1 is as described above for compounds where X is an ethynediyl group can be prepared by different routes from the iodo-compound IX, depending on the nature of R1. As shown in Scheme E&gt; the transformation can for example be carried out<br>
a)	by directly attaching the R1-alkynediyl-substituent via a Sonogashira-type coupling<br>
followed by the reduction of the nitro group or<br>
b)	by two stepwise Sonogashira -type couplings, in which first trimethylsilyl-acetylene is<br>
coupled to iodide IX to yield, after deprotection with sodium hydroxide in methanol, the<br>
intermediate XII which then can be transformed via a second Sonogashira-type coupling<br><br>
with the appropriate reactant R1-I, R1-Br or R1-OSO2CF3 and reduction of the nitro group to the desired compounds.<br>
The exact conditions for the respective compounds can be found in the experimental part.<br><br>
According to Scheme F, the dioxinones and fi-keto esters building blocks with the general formula IV and F/a can be prepared by methods known to someone skilled in the art from the corresponding carboxylic acid derivatives R3-COR, i.e. free acids, methyl or ethyl esters and acid chlorides. The exact conditions for the corresponding compounds can be found in the experimental part.<br>
Another synthetic route to prepare compounds of general formula Ic, in which R and X have the meaning as described above and R3 is a phenyl-carboxamide of general formula C(0)NR4R5, in which R4 and R5 are hydrogen, lower alkyl or R4 and R5 together form a morpholino-residue or a N-methyl-piperazine is outlined in scheme G:<br><br><br>
The exact conditions for the respective compounds can be found in the experimental part.<br>
Still another way to prepare compounds of general formula I is the reaction of 4-aryl-8-iodo-l,3-dihydro-benzo[b][l,4]diazepin-2-ones (General formula Id, Synthetic Scheme<br>
H) with alkynes of general formula R1-C=C-,-, in which R1 has the meaning as described above, in a Sonogashira-coupling.<br><br>
The exact conditions for the respective compounds can be found in the experimental part.<br>
The pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be manufactured readily according to methods known per se and taking into consideration the nature of the compound to be converted into a salt. Inorganic or organic acids such as, for example, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulphuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid or citric acid, formic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, acetic acid, succinic acid, tartaric acid, methanesulphonic acid, p-toluenesulphonic acid and the like are suitable for the formation of pharmaceutically acceptable salts of basic compounds of formula L<br>
The compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts are metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonists and can be used for the treatment or prevention of acute and/or chronic neurological disorders, such as psychosis, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, cognitive disorders and memory deficits. Other treatable indications are restricted brain function caused by bypass operations or transplants, poor blood supply to the brain, spinal cord injuries, head injuries, hypoxia caused by pregnancy, cardiac arrest and<br><br>
hypoglycemia. Further treatable indications are acute and chronic pain, Huntington's chorea, ALS, dementia caused by AIDS, eye injuries, retinopathy, idiopathic parkinsonism or parkinsonism caused by medicaments as well as conditions which lead to glutamate-deficient functions, such as e.g. muscle spasms, convulsions, migraine, urinary incontinence, nicotine addiction, psychoses, opiate addiction, anxiety, vomiting, dyskinesia and depression.<br>
The compounds of formula I and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof can be used as medicaments, e.g. in the form of pharmaceutical preparations. The pharmaceutical preparations can be administered orally, e.g. in the form of tablets, coated tablets, dragees, hard and soft gelatin capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions. However, the administration can also be effected rectally, e.g. in the form of suppositories, or parenterally, e.g. in the form of injection solutions.<br>
The compounds of formula I and pharmaceuticallyacceptable salts thereof can be processed with pharmaceutically inert, inorganic or organic carriers for the production of pharmaceutical preparations. Lactose, corn starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts and the like can be used, for example, as such carriers for tablets, coated tablets, dragees and hard gelatin capsules. Suitable carriers for soft gelatin capsules are, for example, vegetable oils, waxes, fats, semi-solid and liquid polyols and the like; depending on the nature of the active substance no carriers are, however, usually required in the case of soft gelatin capsules. Suitable carriers for the production of solutions and syrups are, for example, water, polyols, sucrose, invert sugar, glucose and the like. Adjuvants, such as alcohols, polyols, glycerol, vegetable oils and the like, can be used for aqueous injection solutions of water-soluble salts of compounds of formula I, but as a rule are not necessary. Suitable carriers for suppositories are, for example, natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats, semi-liquid or liquid polyols and the like.<br>
In addition, the pharmaceutical preparations can contain preservatives, solubilizers, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, sweeteners, colorants, flavorants, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffers, masking agents or antioxidants. They can also contain still other therapeutically valuable substances.<br>
As mentioned earlier, medicaments containing one or more compounds of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and a therapeutically inert excipient are also an object of the present invention, as is a process for the production of such medicaments which comprises bringing one or more compounds of formula I or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof and, if desired, one or more other therapeutically valuable<br><br>
substances into a galenical dosage form together with one or more therapeutically inert carriers.<br>
The dosage can vary within wide limits and will, of course, be fitted to the individual requirements in each particular case. In general, the effective dosage for oral or parenteral administration is between 0.01-20 mg/kg/day, with a dosage of 0.1-10 mg/ kg/day being preferred for all of the indications described. The daily dosage for an adult human being weighing 70 kg accordingly lies between 0.7-1400 mg per day, preferably between 7 and 700 mg per day.<br>
The present invention relates also to the use of compounds of formula I and of pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof for the production of medicaments, especially for the control or prevention of acute and/or chronic neurological disorders of the aforementioned kind.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are group II mGlu receptor antagonists as determined using the assay described by Cartmell et al. (Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998,123(3), 497-504).<br>
The compounds show activities, as measured in the assay described below, of 50 |μ Mf or<br>
less, typically 3μ M or less, and ideally of 0.5 μ M or less. In the table below are described some specific pKi values of preferred compounds<br><br><br><br><br>

r3Hl-LY354740 binding on mGlu2 transfected CHO cell membranes<br>
Transfection and cell culture<br>
cDNA encoding the rat mGlu2 receptor protein in pBluescript II was obtained from Prof. S. Nakanishi (Kyoto, Japan), and subcloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA I-amp from Invitrogen (NV Leek, The Netherlands). This vector construct (pcDlmGR2) was co-transfected with a psvNeo plasmid encoding the gene for neomycin resistance, into CHO cells by a modified calcium phosphate method described by Chen &amp; Okayama (1988). The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle medium with reduced L-glutamine (2mM final concentration) and 10% dialysed foetal calf serum from Gibco BRL (Basel, Switzerland). Selection was made in the presence of G-418 (1000 ug/ml final). Clones were identified by reverse transcription of 5pg total RNA, followed by PCR using mGlu2 receptor specific primers 5'-atcactgcttgggtttctggcactg-3' and 5'-agcatcactgtgggtggcataggagc-37 in 60mM Tris HC1 (pH 10), 15mM (NH4SO4,2 xnM MgCl2,25 units/ml Taq Polymerase with 30 cycles annealing at 60°C for 1 min.&gt; extension at 72°C for 30s, and 1 min. 95°C denaturation.<br>
Membrane preparation<br>
Cells, cultured as above., were harvested and washed three times with cold PBS and frozen<br>

[3H]-LY354740 binding<br>
After thawing, the membranes were resuspended in cold 50mM Tris-HCl buffer containing 2 mM MgCl2 and 2 mM CaCb, (pH 7) (binding buffer). The final concentration of the membranes in the assays was 25 \ig protein/ml. Inhibition experiments were performed with membranes incubated with 10 nM [3H]-LY354740 at room temperature, for 1 hour, in presence of various concentrations of the compound to be tested. Following the incubations, membranes were filtered onto Whatmann GF/C glass fiber filters and washed 5 times with cold binding buffer. Non specific binding was measured in the presence of 10 |iM DCGIV (TOCRIS No. 0975). After transfer of the filters into plastic vials containing 10 ml of Ultima-gold scintillation fluid (Packard, Zurich, Switzerland), the radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation in a Tri-Carb 2500 TR counter (Packard, Zurich, Switzerland).<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
General procedure A (Synthetic Scheme D):<br>
Preparation of (4-iodo-2-nitro-phenyl)-carbamic acid tert.-butyl esters from 4-iodo-2-nitroanilines.<br>
Method a<br>
To a solution of diphosgene (4.1 mL, 34.1 mmol) in EtOAc (40 mL) at 0 °C was added a solution of the 4-iodo-2-nitroaniline (45.5 mmol) in EtOAc (200-500 mL), and the mixture was heated to reflux for 18 h. The solvent was removed in vacuum to leave a brown solid, which was triturated with hot hexane (200 mL). The solid material was filtered off and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure to leave the pure 4-iodo-2-nitrophenylisocyanate as a yellow solid. This material was refiuxed in a mixture of excess tert.-BuOH in CH2CI2 for 2.5 h. Removal of the solvent left an orange solid which<br><br>
was purified by silica gel column chromatography with hexane/EtOAc to give the (4-iodo-2-nitro-phenyl)-carbamic acid tert.-butyl ester as a yellow solid.<br>
Method b<br>
To a mixture of the 4-iodo-2-nitroaniline (142 mmol) and cesium carbonate (55.5 g, 170 mmol) in 2-butanone (740 mL) was dropwise added a solution of Boc20 (37.8 g, 173 mmol) in 2-butanone (170 mL) and the resulting mixture was stirred at 52 °C for 26 h. The solvent was removed in vacuum, the residue was treated with a mixture of H2O (240 mL) and MeOH (240 mL) and extracted with hexane (3 x 500 mL). The combined hexane layer was washed with brine (200 mL) and all aqueous layers were reextracted with hexane (300 mL). All combined hexane layers were dried over MgSO4, filtered and the solvent was removed in vacuum to give an orange solid, which was purified by silica gel column chromatography with hexane/EtOAc to give the (4-iodo-2-nitro-phenyl)-carbamic acid tert.-butyl ester as a yellow solid.<br>
Method c<br>
To a solution of the 4-iodo-2-nitroaniline (550 mmol) and DMAP (1.22 g, 10 mmol) in THF (1000 mL) at 23 °C was dropwise added within 70 min a solution of Boc20 (246 g, 1128 mmol) in THF (500 mL) and stirring was continued at 23 °C for 75 min. The entire mixture was evaporated to dryness and dried at HV to leave a dark brown solid (253.59 g). This material was dissolved in DCM (1100 mL), cooled to 0 °C and TFA (84 mL, 1100 mmol) was added dropwise. The mixture was stirred at 0 °C for 2 h, poured into icecold sat. NaHC03-soL, extracted with DCM, washed with brine and dried over MgS04. Removal of the solvent in vacuum left a dark brown solid (199.71 g) which was coated on silica gel and purified by silica gel column chromatography with hexane/EtOAc to give the (4-iodo-2-nitro-phenyl)-carbamic acid tert.-butyl ester as a yellow solid.<br>

To a solution of 3-[7-(4-fluoro-phenyl)-4-oxo-4,5-dihydro-3H-benzo[b] [l,4]diazepin-2-yl]-benzoic acid (Example 163) (262 mg, 0.7 mmol) and 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (130 mg, 0.84 mmol) in CH3CN/DMF (7 mL/10 mL), cooled to 0 °C, was added EDC (161 mg, 0.84 mmol) and the mixture was stirred at 0 °C for 1 h. N-hydroxy-acetamidine (62 mg, 0.84 mmol) was added and stirring was continued for 4 h at 23 °C. The reaction mixture was partitioned between ethyl acetate and H2O and the organic layer was dried over Na2S04 and evaporated in vacuum. The residue was heated in toluene (30 mL) for 20 h at reflux. The mixture was cooled, evaporated in vacuum and the residue was chromatographed on silica gel using ethyl acetate/hexane (2:1) as eluent. The purified product was triturated with ethyl acetate to give the tide compound as light yellow solid (49 mg).<br>
