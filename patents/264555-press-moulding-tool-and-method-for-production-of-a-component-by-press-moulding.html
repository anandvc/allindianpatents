				<td>Press molding tool and method for production of a<br>
component by press molding<br>
The invention relates to a press molding tool and to a<br>
method for production of a component by press molding.<br>
For production of components of this type, it is known<br>
from the prior art to use an upper tool and a lower<br>
tool in order to mold a support layer and a decoration<br>
layer into a predetermined component shape by pressing<br>
them together and in order to connect them to each<br>
other. During the molding of the layers into a<br>
component shape with a three-dimensional curvature or<br>
contour, there is the problem that the materials tend<br>
to crease when the upper tool and the lower tool are<br>
moved together. These creases are then permanently<br>
pressed into the materials and result in the component<br>
produced not being able to be used. For this reason,<br>
use is made of a clamping frame with which the<br>
decorative material or the mat is clamped and is held<br>
in a predetermined manner in order to prevent creases<br>
from forming on the component in the region between the<br>
lower tool and the upper tool.<br>
DE 29 25 500 Al discloses a press for production of<br>
laminated, sheetlike molded parts from a preferably<br>
thermoplastic support layer and a flexible laminating<br>
layer. The press has two profiled pressing plates which<br>
are movable with respect to each other and of which one<br>
is provided with a shearing edge in order to form a<br>
first cutting device, which shearing edge interacts<br>
with a ring-like element as the counterposition. The<br>
press has a second cutting device which is formed by a<br>
blade, which is connected to the other profiled<br>
pressing plate, and by a surface of the ring-like<br>
element. The two cutting devices are spaced apart from<br>
each other in a plane transverse with respect to the<br>
common cutting direction. By means of this arrangement,<br>
the support layer and the laminating layer are clamped<br>
and cut as the presses move together such that stresses<br>
occur in the layers within the molding region. As a<br>
result, the quality of the component is negatively<br>
affected.<br>
It is the object of the invention to provide a press<br>
molding tool and a method for production of a component<br>
by press molding, with which trimming of the layers<br>
placed into the production apparatus is achieved,<br>
wherein high component quality can be achieved.<br>
This object is achieved by the features of the<br>
independent claims. Further embodiments according to<br>
the invention are described in the subclaims which<br>
refer back to said independent patent claims.<br>
According to the invention, a press molding tool is<br>
provided for production of a component from at least<br>
one first material layer and one second material layer<br>
with at least one first tool part and one second tool<br>
part each having a three-dimensional molding contour,<br>
wherein, when the first material layer and the second<br>
material layer are placed into the apparatus, the<br>
molding contour of the first tool part faces the first<br>
material layer and the molding contour of the second<br>
tool part faces the second material layer, wherein the<br>
tool parts are clamped in a pressure transducer in<br>
order to bring about the molding of the first material<br>
layer and of the second material layer and the<br>
connection of the two material layers to each other by<br>
moving the first and the second tool parts together,<br>
and with a clamping frame device in order to hold the<br>
material layers in their closed position outside the<br>
contour region of the tool during the molding<br>
operation,<br>
wherein the clamping frame device comprises a<br>
first clamping frame element which is movable relative<br>
to the first tool part by means of a first adjusting<br>
device, and a second clamping frame element which is<br>
movable relative to the second tool part by means of a<br>
second adjusting device, the clamping frame elements<br>
being arranged for retaining the at least two material<br>
layers, and at least one spacer element for spacing<br>
apart. the clamping frame elements in the closed<br>
position of the same being arranged at least on one of<br>
the clamping frame elements such that, in the closed<br>
position of the clamping frame elements and during a<br>
pressing operation carried out by means of the tool<br>
parts, a continued flowing of at least one of the<br>
inserted material layers is permitted, and<br>
wherein the press molding tool comprises a cutting<br>
device with a blade which, as seen in the in the<br>
opening and closing direction, runs in a segmental<br>
manner on the circumference of the tool parts or<br>
completely encircles the latter, for cutting off an<br>
excess length of the material layers, which excess<br>
length is present next to the first and the second tool<br>
part during the press molding and is movable relative<br>
to the first or second clamping frame element.<br>
Even in the case of a completely encircling blade, the<br>
blade can be divided in a segmental manner in the<br>
encircling direction.<br>
The at least one spacer element can be of settable<br>
design, with it being possible for the setting of at<br>
least one spacer element to take place mechanically or<br>
via a control device.<br>
A respective spacer element can be arranged on each of<br>
the clamping frame elements, which spacer elements come<br>
to bear against one another in the closed position.<br>
The cutting movement of the blade of the cutting device<br>
can run parallel to or transversely to the adjusting<br>
movement of the tool parts.<br>
The blade of the cutting device can be heated by means<br>
of a heating device. The heating device of the blade<br>
can have a receptacle for at least one heating<br>
cartridge which can be inserted therein. Alternatively,<br>
the heating device of the blade can have electric<br>
resistance heating.<br>
The cutting device can be designed in such a manner<br>
that, in the closed position of the clamping frame<br>
elements, the blade can be positioned in such a manner<br>
that, in its initial position, it does not touch the<br>
material layers placed into the clamping frame.<br>
The inovability of the blade can be brought about by an<br>
electric, hydraulic or pneumatic drive or by a manual<br>
actuating device.<br>
The blade can be arranged in such a manner that, in its<br>
cutting position, it at least partially protrudes<br>
through the first clamping frame element.<br>
According to the invention, a method is furthermore<br>
provided for production of a component by press molding<br>
of a first and of a second material layer, during which<br>
the two Layers are connected within the molding<br>
contours of two tool parts by moving the latter<br>
together, the first tool part and the second tool part<br>
having been moved apart in an initial position. Here,<br>
the following steps are provided:<br>
(a) moving the first clamping frame element and the<br>
second clamping frame element from the initial<br>
position into an extended position with respect to<br>
each other and placing the at least two material<br>
layers; between the two tool parts, with the first<br>
and the second clamping frame elements being<br>
arranged outside the molding contours of the tool<br>
parts,<br>
 (b) moving the first clamping frame element and the<br>
second clamping frame element into a position<br>
until they are spaced apart from at least one<br>
spacer element arranged on at least one of the<br>
clamping frame elements such that the first and<br>
the second material layer are retained by the<br>
first and the second clamping frame element at a<br>
predefined distance of the mutually facing<br>
surfaces of the clamping frame elements,<br>
(c) moving the tool parts together relative to each<br>
other and carrying out the press molding in the<br>
region of the molding contours of the tool parts,<br>
(d) cutting off an excess length of at least one of<br>
the two material layers, which excess length is<br>
present between the first and the second tool<br>
part, by means of a blade of a cutting device, the<br>
blade being moved during the cutting operation in<br>
such a manner that a corresponding region of the<br>
bearing region of the second clamping frame<br>
element, which bearing region faces the cutting<br>
edge of the blade, or of one of the tool parts<br>
acts as the counterposition for the cutting edge<br>
during the cutting operation,<br>
(e) moving the tool parts and the clamping frame<br>
elements apart in order to be able to remove the<br>
press-molded and interconnected first and second<br>
material layers from the tool.<br>
The invention is described below with reference to the<br>
attached drawings, in which:<br>
figure I shows a first, embodiment of the press<br>
molding tool according to the invention with a<br>
cutting device in a closed position in which the<br>
press molding tool is in a closed position and a<br>
first and a second clamping frame element have<br>
been moved together;<br>
figure 2 shows an alternative embodiment of the<br>
press molding tool according to the invention with<br>
an alternative cutting device in a closed<br>
position.<br>
The press molding tool according to the invention and<br>
the method for production of a component by press<br>
molding relate to the production of a component from at<br>
least one first material layer 1 and at least one<br>
second material layer 2. The layers can be, for<br>
example, a decoration layer and a support layer. With<br>
the tool and the method, molding of the first layer and<br>
of the second layer and the connection of the two<br>
layers to each other take place by moving together a<br>
first tool part, which faces the first material layer,<br>
and a second tool part, which faces the second material<br>
layer, of the press molding tool. In general, both<br>
layers can be multi-layered, with it also being<br>
possible for a plurality of layers of the first layer<br>
or of the second layer to be molded and connected to<br>
one another by the method and the apparatus according<br>
to the invention. In the description below, a singleor<br>
multi-layered material layer, which is intended for<br>
bearing against the contour-shaping region of the first<br>
tool part, is referred to as the first material layer.<br>
Analogously, a single- or multi-layered material layer,<br>
which is intended for bearing against the contourshaping<br>
region of the second tool part, is referred to<br>
below as the second material layer. In general, the<br>
first and the second material layers are layers which<br>
can be connected to one another under pressure, for<br>
example can be fused or interlocked at least in some<br>
regions.<br>
One of the two material layers in the component to be<br>
produced is preferably a decoration layer and the other<br>
of the two layers is a support layer. Embodiments of<br>
the invention are described below, in which the first<br>
material layer is a decoration layer and the second<br>
material layer is a support layer. However, it is also<br>
possible that, conversely, the first material layer is<br>
a support layer and the second material layer is a<br>
decoration layer. Also, one of the two layers does not<br>
have to be a decoration layer or support layer. For<br>
example, the first and the second layers can be two<br>
support layers or two intermediate layers or one<br>
support layer and a reinforcing layer, such as, for<br>
example, a layer made of glass cloth.<br>
In the case of production of the component with a<br>
support layer and a decoration layer, the mutually<br>
facing sides of the decoration layer and of the support<br>
layer have to be connectable to each other by pressure<br>
exerted by the tool and, if appropriate, with the use<br>
of heat. For this purpose, that material layer of the<br>
decoration layer which faces the support layer can have<br>
the property of connecting mechanically to the support<br>
layer under pressure, for example by mechanical interlocking<br>
of threads or hairs provided on the mentioned<br>
side of the decoration layer with the possibly fused-on<br>
surface of the support layer. For this purpose, at<br>
least the surface of the decoration layer, which<br>
surface faces the support layer, can be formed from a<br>
woven cloth which can be, for example, a fleece, a<br>
felt, a flat cloth, or a circular knit. The decoration<br>
layer can also be connected to the support layer by<br>
fusing the mutually facing surfaces with the use of<br>
pressure by the tool and, if appropriate, with the use<br>
of heat. Fusing is achieved if the decoration layer<br>
contains foam constituents which belong to the same<br>
family of materials as the support layer provided for<br>
the fusion.<br>
As the decoration layer, use can be made here of a<br>
textile cloth, an expanded leather cloth, a plastics<br>
sheet or a leather. If a textile cloth is used as the<br>
decoration layer, a layer of textile materials or<br>
sheets or a combination of the alternatives mentioned<br>
can be used for the starting material. In the case of<br>
the component to be produced, a decoration layer can<br>
also be provided in order to optimize the haptic<br>
properties of the end product on the corresponding side<br>
of the component. For this purpose, the decoration<br>
layer can also have foam constituents. For example, the<br>
decoration layer can be a composite of textile<br>
materials, a foam and a fleece material. The foam used<br>
can be a PP foam or PE foam or a foam built up on PU.<br>
As the support layer, in particular a plastic and<br>
especially a polypropylene (PP)-bound fiber mat is<br>
provided. Said support layer can be in particular<br>
plasticized by the supply of heat. The support layer is<br>
preferably formed from a fiber material, preferably of<br>
natural fibers or glass fibers and of plastic fibers<br>
and, in particular, polypropylene (PP) fibers. The<br>
natural fibers can be formed from flax or kenaf, sisal,<br>
linen or cotton. In this case, said fibers are shaped<br>
to form a mat in a preparatory step or a step preceding<br>
the method. Subsequently, an interconnected plastic mat<br>
material is formed as a first or second layer with<br>
fusion of the plastic components under application of<br>
pressure and temperature.<br>
The invention is described below with reference to an<br>
embodiment of a press molding material with a cutting<br>
device and with reference to a method for production of<br>
a component by press molding and with a cutting<br>
operation in which the cutting apparatus according to<br>
the invention can be used.<br>
The press molding material according to the invention<br>
for production of a component from at least one first<br>
material layer 1, a decoration layer in the embodiment<br>
described, and one second material layer 2, a support<br>
layer in the embodiment described, is a molding tool 10<br>
_ Q _<br>
which determines the contour of the component to be<br>
produced from the material layers and has at least one<br>
first tool part 11, which faces the first layer and has<br>
a three-dimensional molding contour 13, and one second<br>
tool part 12, which faces the second layer and has a<br>
three-dimensional molding contour 14. The tool parts<br>
11, 12 are moved toward each other by a pressure<br>
transducer (not illustrated) in order to bring about<br>
the molding of the first material layer 1, or the<br>
decoration layer, and of the second material layer 2,<br>
or the support layer, and the connection of the two<br>
material layers 1, 2 to each other by moving the first<br>
and the second tool parts 11 and 12 together. The first<br>
tool part 11 can be fitted to a first tool holder or an<br>
installation plate 15 arid a second tool part 12 can be<br>
fitted to a second tool holder or an installation plate<br>
16.<br>
The press molding tool according to the invention<br>
furthermore has a clamping frame device 20 with<br>
clamping frame elements which are movable with respect<br>
to one another and in relation to the tool parts 11,<br>
12, in order to hold the material layers 1, 2 in a<br>
predetermined manner outside the contour region of the<br>
tool during the molding operation. Said clamping frame<br>
device comprises a first clamping frame element 21<br>
which is movable relative to the first tool part 11 by<br>
means of a first adjusting device 31, and a second<br>
clamping frame element 22 which is movable relative to<br>
the second tool part 12. The movability of the clamping<br>
frames 31, 32, 33 refers at least to the movability in<br>
the direction of the opening and closing movement of<br>
the tool parts 11, 12. The clamping frame elements 21<br>
and 22 are guided in their direction of movement via<br>
the adjusting devices 31, 32 and/or via separate<br>
guides.<br>
The first and second adjusting devices 31 and 32 are<br>
devices which are activated by a control device for<br>
automatic control, or, if appropriate, additionally via<br>
an actuating device for manual or semi-automatic<br>
control, of the production process in order to move the<br>
respective clamping frame elements 21, 22. The second<br>
adjusting device 32 is preferably coupled mechanically<br>
to the second tool part 12, for example by being fitted<br>
on a second tool holder or a second installation plate<br>
16. However, the second adjusting device 32 can also be<br>
arranged on a support (not shown) which is independent<br>
of the position of the second tool part 12 such that,<br>
in this case, its extension position is independent of<br>
the position of the second tool part 12.<br>
The clamping frame elements 21, 22 are each arranged<br>
outside the contour-shaping regions of the tool parts<br>
11, 12. Said clamping frame elements can be formed as a<br>
single piece and designed as a structure which<br>
encircles the tool parts 11, 12. The clamping frame<br>
elements can also be formed in a number of parts along<br>
the circumference or along a region of the<br>
circumference of the tool parts 11, 12 and in a manner<br>
encircling the tool parts 11, 12 in some regions. A<br>
clamping frame element can also be formed from two<br>
parts which are arranged at locations outside the tool<br>
parts 11, 12. These locations can be situated in<br>
particular diametrically opposite each other. It is<br>
also possible for a plurality of parts, for example<br>
three or four parts, of a clamping frame element to be<br>
arranged outside the circumference of the particular<br>
tool part 11 or 12 or of the tool parts 11, 12 in a<br>
regular or irregular distribution about the latter,<br>
depending in each case on the application.<br>
The clamping frame elements can be formed differently.<br>
The construction and arrangement of the clamping frame<br>
elements depends on the type, material and design of<br>
the component to be produced and on the type, material<br>
and design of the materials. The clamping frame<br>
elements 31, 32 each have a bearing region or two<br>
bearing regions which is or are provided during the<br>
production of the component for the purpose of an<br>
excess length region of the first and/or second layer<br>
being able to be placed against it and/or them. The<br>
first clamping frame element 21 and the second clamping<br>
frame element 22 each have a bearing region. The<br>
bearing region 21a of the first clamping frame element<br>
21 faces a first bearing region 22a of the second<br>
clamping frame element 22. These bearing regions 21a<br>
and 22a are each designed in such a manner that a<br>
holding of an excess length region of the first and<br>
second material layers I and 2 is possible as the<br>
clamping frame elements 21 and 22 are correspondingly<br>
moved together. The holding can comprise clamping or<br>
retention, in particular with the possibility of the<br>
layers 1, 2 continuing to flow, or a combination of<br>
these functions.<br>
In addition, machining of the layers and, in<br>
particular, trimming of the outer regions of the layers<br>
can take place subsequently independently of each<br>
other. Depending on the application, it can be<br>
provided, in particular by means of a special coating,<br>
that a bearing region or a plurality of bearing regions<br>
inhibits or inhibit the continued flowing of one or<br>
both of the layers 1, 2. The mutually facing bearing<br>
regions 21a, 22a do not absolutely have to run parallel<br>
to each other. The bearing regions 21a, 22a can be<br>
coated in some regions or over the entire surface or<br>
can be provided with corresponding inserts in order,<br>
depending on requirements, to facilitate or make it<br>
more difficult for the layer 1 or 2 retained between<br>
the two clamping frame elements 21, 22 to continue<br>
flowing. In order to facilitate a continued flowing of<br>
a layer 1 or 2, the respective bearing regions or<br>
segments arranged, thereon can contain, for example,<br>
polytetrafluoro ethylene (PTFE) constituents or can<br>
have a relatively low surface roughness. For this<br>
purpose, the respective bearing regions or segments<br>
arranged thereon can also have a metallic coating<br>
which, for example, is applied by electro-plating. In<br>
order to make it more difficult for a layer 1 or 2 to<br>
continue flowing, the respective bearing regions can<br>
contain friction-increasing constituents or segments.<br>
For this purpose, a suitable surface structure can also<br>
be provided.<br>
The respective bearing regions 21a, 22a, which are<br>
provided for holding a layer 1 or 2, or segments<br>
arranged on said bearing regions and/or the tool parts<br>
11 or 12 can be designed in a manner such that their<br>
temperature can be controlled entirely or in some<br>
regions by means of a temperature control device. In<br>
this case, all of the bearing regions 21a, 22a or an<br>
individual bearing region or only two mutually facing<br>
bearing regions or else just one tool part 11 or 12 can<br>
be temperature controlled entirely or in some regions.<br>
The temperature control device which can be arranged<br>
for this purpose is designed in such a manner that it<br>
can be used to set or regulate a temperature of the<br>
bearing region or of the segment constantly or as a<br>
function of time or process. The setting can be<br>
realized by means of a control, also with the aid of<br>
temperature sensors, in the bearing region or segment<br>
to be temperature-controlled in each case. The<br>
alternative regulation takes place on the basis of the<br>
temperatures, which are detected by means of<br>
temperature sensors, on the bearing region or segment<br>
to be temperature-controlled in each case.<br>
By controlling the temperature of at least one bearing<br>
region or segment, the play of guides or fits or the<br>
spacing of movable parts can be optimized and, in<br>
particular, can be reduced, since the expansions of<br>
movable parts caused by the temperature changes can be<br>
set within predefined limits. The accuracy of the<br>
tools, the operational reliability and reliability of<br>
the production apparatus can thereby be improved.<br>
A further advantage which can be achieved by<br>
controlling the temperature of at least regions of the<br>
bearing surfaces or segments or of at least one<br>
clamping frame element of the clamping frame device 20<br>
or of one or more of the molding tools 10 is that the<br>
formation of condensed water on a supercooled tool or<br>
clamping frame surface can be prevented. This also<br>
prevents the layers from being cooled, said cooling<br>
making it more difficult and even preventing the layers<br>
from being able to be molded and connected to each<br>
other.<br>
The temperature control mentioned makes it possible to<br>
prevent regions of the bearing surfaces or segments<br>
from overheating. Overheating of this type would, in<br>
particular, negatively influence the surface structure<br>
of the component to be produced, as a result of which,<br>
in particular, a possibly desirable bowing effect, such<br>
as, for example, anti-dazzle effect, could be<br>
prevented. Therefore, it is advantageous, during the<br>
temperature control in particular also by means of a<br>
cooling mechanism, to provide a predefined process<br>
temperature.<br>
The controlling of the temperature of one or both of<br>
the tool parts 11, 12, which control can be provided in<br>
addition or as an alternative to the controlling of the<br>
temperature of clamping frame elements, can be<br>
temperature-controlled by means of the abovementioned<br>
temperature control device or by means of a further<br>
temperature control device. In this case, a respective<br>
region on the molding contour 13 or 14 is temperaturecontrolled<br>
in order to bring or obtain the material<br>
used for the particular layer 1 or 2 to an<br>
advantageously processible state. A further advantage<br>
is that, by controlling the temperature of parts of the<br>
production apparatus, optimized configuration or<br>
operation of the same can take place.<br>
The tool parts 11, 12 are movable with respect to each<br>
other between two positions by means of a tool<br>
advancing device (not illustrated). Each clamping frame<br>
element 21, 22 is also movable independently by means<br>
of a respectively correspondingly assigned adjusting<br>
device 31 and 32. Mechanical connection of the<br>
respective adjusting devices 31 and 32 to the tools 11,<br>
12 enables the frequency of the required actuations of<br>
the adjusting devices to be reduced, since some of<br>
these can be undertaken by the press. The positions<br>
between which the clamping frame elements are movable,<br>
and the positions between which the tool parts are<br>
movable at the same time, are provided in such a manner<br>
that the first and the second layers 1, 2 can be<br>
inserted between the tool parts that have been moved<br>
apart and the layers can also be molded and pressed on<br>
while, at the same time, those excess length regions or<br>
edge regions of the layers 1, 2 which are placed<br>
outside the molding contours 13, 14 are secured in such<br>
a manner that, over the course of the tool parts 11, 12<br>
being moved together, continued flowing of one or both<br>
of the layers is temporarily possible.<br>
According to the invention, for this purpose, at least<br>
one spacer element 41, 42 for spacing apart the<br>
clamping frame elements 21, 22 in the closed position<br>
of the same is arranged at least on one of the clamping<br>
frame elements 21, 22. As a result, in the closed<br>
position of the clamping frame elements 21, 22 and<br>
during a pressing operation carried out by means of the<br>
tool parts 11, 12, continued flowing of at least one of<br>
the inserted material layers 1, 2 is permitted.<br>
The extension positions of the advancing devices for<br>
the tool parts or the clamping frame elements can be<br>
coupled to one another. Alternatively, partial or<br>
complete independence of the extension positions can be<br>
realized, for example by the adjusting device for the<br>
tool and the adjusting device for a clamping frame<br>
element assigned to said tool being arranged or fitted<br>
independently of each other mechanically.<br>
The adjusting device positions required in the<br>
production method and therefore the retraction and<br>
extension positions of the tool parts 11, 12 and of the<br>
clamping frame elements 21, 22 can be achieved by means<br>
of sensors and a comparison of the particular desired<br>
and actual position in a corresponding control device.<br>
In this case, it can be provided that the sensors<br>
detect the position of a corresponding actuating<br>
element in the respective advancing device or the<br>
position of the respective clamping frame element or<br>
tool part itself.<br>
Alternatively, the designated retraction and extension<br>
positions of the clamping frame elements 21, 22 can be<br>
achieved via mechanical limiting elements. In a special<br>
embodiment, each adjusting device needs to be moved to<br>
and fro only in a predefined sequence between two<br>
opposite end positions, in a manner controlled via an<br>
assigned control device, in order to fulfill the<br>
correct function for the production method according to<br>
the invention. The saving of sensors and a control<br>
based on a desired-actual comparison for the respective<br>
extension position of each adjusting device makes this<br>
embodiment of the production apparatus cost-effective.<br>
For this purpose, two spacers 51, 52 connected to the<br>
tool parts 11 and 12 can be integrated in the press<br>
molding tool. The pressing position of the tool parts<br>
11, 12 is able to be defined by said spacers. These<br>
spacers 51, 52 can also be omitted.<br>
When the spacers are configured as height-changeable<br>
spacers, they can be extended via an actuating drive,<br>
which is functionally connected to the control device,<br>
in order to bring about the spacing, which is required<br>
in phases, of the respectively interacting clamping<br>
frame elements by means of a corresponding extension<br>
position of the particular spacer at a particular<br>
moment. In addition to such an electronically<br>
controlled adjustment of the spacers, the latter can<br>
alternatively also be controlled hydraulically or via a<br>
radial cam. Such a radial cam for the clamping frame<br>
elements preferably takes the respective positions of<br>
the tool parts into consideration.<br>
In the illustrated embodiment of the pressing tool<br>
according to the invention, a respective distancing<br>
element 41, 42 is arranged on each clamping frame<br>
element 21, 22. In general, at least one spacer element<br>
41, 42 is arranged at least on one of the clamping<br>
frame elements 21, 22. Alternatively, a respective<br>
spacer element can be arranged on each of the clamping<br>
frame elements 41, 22, which spacer elements come to<br>
bear against each other in the closed position<br>
(figures 1 and 2) . A plurality of spacer elements can<br>
also be arranged on each of the clamping frame elements<br>
41, 22.<br>
A distancing element 41, 42 can be designed as a rigid<br>
distancing element or a distancing element which is<br>
height- or length-changeable and settable in the<br>
direction of the movements or corresponding relative<br>
movements of the clamping frame elements. The setting<br>
of the at least one spacer element can also take place<br>
mechanically or via a control device. When distancing<br>
elements which are fixed with respect to the movements<br>
of the clamping frame elements, i.e. are not heightchangeable,<br>
are used, movement of the respective<br>
clamping frame elements together results in a defined<br>
distance between them with respect to the material<br>
layers 1, 2 during the production process. When heightchangeable<br>
distancing elements are used, the end<br>
positions of the clamping frame elements defined by<br>
these are, the continuing-flowing and clamping behavior<br>
of the clamping frame elements with regard to the<br>
layers 1, 2 respectively held can be changed. The<br>
effect achieved by this is that, in each position of<br>
the tool parts, a continued flowing of the layers 1 and<br>
2 held by the clamping frame elements is ensured, if<br>
this is required by the molding contour provided by the<br>
tool parts 11, 12, in order to produce the component in<br>
the designated form, thickness and strength in a<br>
crease-free manner.<br>
The tool parts 11, 12 are movable via a tool<br>
intermediate position into a closed position or<br>
pressing position or laminating position (figures 1 and<br>
2).<br>
According to the invention, a cutting device 300 is<br>
provided with a blade or cutting blade 330 which is<br>
movable by an advancing device 301 and, if appropriate,<br>
is guided by a mechanism with a guide in order to trim<br>
the first material layer 1 and optionally also the<br>
second material layer 2.<br>
The advancing device of the cutting device 300 and the<br>
mechanism with the guide are designed in such a manner<br>
that the cutting movement of the blade 330 runs<br>
parallel (figure 2) or vertically or at another angle,<br>
i.e. generally transversely (figure 1), to the<br>
adjusting movement of the tool parts. The angle of the<br>
cutting movement is in a functional interrelationship<br>
with the profile of the surface, which faces the blade<br>
330, of the material layer to be cut in each case or of<br>
the material layers to be cut.<br>
The surface of that contour of the cutting edge 335 of<br>
the blade 330 which is effective for the cutting<br>
operation is preferably directed at 90° plus or minus<br>
an angular region relative to the surface, which faces<br>
the blade, of the material layer to be cut. The angular<br>
region for the orientation of the cutting edge depends<br>
on the edge to be formed on the material layers and on<br>
the type and composition of the materials to be cut.<br>
The cutting edge 350 of the cutting blade 330 can be<br>
designed in particular as a contour-dependent cutting<br>
surface, i.e. as a three-dimensional cutting surface.<br>
The cutting blade 330 can be formed as a blade which<br>
surrounds the tool parts 11, 12 in some regions or<br>
segmentally. The blade 330 can also be in the form of<br>
an encircling blade. The blade here can be formed in an<br>
encircling manner as a single part or can be<br>
constructed in segments. If the blade is formed in an<br>
encircling manner as a single part, the advancing<br>
movement for the blade preferably runs in the closing<br>
or opening direction of the tool parts 11, 12. During a<br>
cutting movement of the blade at an angle to the<br>
closing or opening direction of the tool parts 11, 12,<br>
the blade 330, for geometrical reasons, is to be<br>
provided on the circumference of the tool parts 11, 12<br>
in some regions or in segmental form.<br>
The cutting blade 330 can be designed either as a<br>
thermal or mechanical blade. In the embodiment as a<br>
thermal blade, the latter is able to be heated, for<br>
example via a resistor. By heating the blade, a sealing<br>
function can be fulfilled, in particular in the case of<br>
temperature-sensitive material layers.<br>
The embodiment, illustrated in figure 1, of a cutting<br>
device 300 has a blade which is movable in the<br>
adjusting movement of the tool parts and can be, for<br>
example, a thermal blade or a cutting blade 330. In the<br>
case of this cutting device, the blade is arranged<br>
movably within a groove or cutout which runs in the<br>
adjusting direction of the tool parts in the first<br>
clamping frame element 21. The bearing region 22a of<br>
the second clamping frame element 22 is used as a<br>
counterposition for the cutting force to be applied.<br>
Alternatively, the cutting device 300 can also be<br>
arranged on or in the second clamping frame element 22.<br>
A cutting device 300 can also be arranged both in the<br>
first clamping frame element 21 and in the second<br>
clamping frame element 22. In this case, the bearing<br>
region of the respectively opposite clamping frame<br>
element is used as the counterposition. The blades can<br>
be positioned, as seen in the cutting direction<br>
thereof, one above another or offset with respect to<br>
one another.<br>
Figure 1 shows the cutting device 300 in its initial<br>
position while figure 2 shows the state of an<br>
alternative cutting device after the cutting movement<br>
has been carried out.<br>
It can be provided that the embodiments of the cutting<br>
device according to the invention is provided to sever<br>
just one layer, to be precise the closest material<br>
layer, or a plurality of or all of the material layers.<br>
The cutting device 300 illustrated in figure 2 has a<br>
blade 330 which can be actuated at an angle<br>
transversely with respect to the adjusting or closing<br>
movement of the tool parts 11, 12. In this embodiment,<br>
a corresponding region of the press molding tool is<br>
used as the counterposition for the cutting force to be<br>
applied, said region, in the embodiment shown, being<br>
part of the second tool part 12. In the embodiment<br>
illustrated, the cutting device or the blade is<br>
arranged on that side of the first clamping frame<br>
element 21 which lies opposite the second clamping<br>
frame element 22.<br>
Alternatively, the blade can be arranged between the<br>
first clamping frame element 21 and the second clamping<br>
frame element 22.<br>
The cutting process by means of the cutting device 300<br>
is as follows:<br>
On the basis of the actuation of a corresponding<br>
actuating drive of the blade 330, the latter is moved<br>
up to a corresponding region of the counterposition<br>
which faces the cutting edge of the blade. The excess<br>
length of at least one of the material layers<br>
respectively facing the blade is then cut off by the<br>
pressure or the temperature applied on the basis of the<br>
advancing movement of the blade 330.<br>

material layer 1 and the second material layer 2<br>
are retained by the first clamping frame element<br>
21 and the second clamping frame element 22 at a<br>
predefined distance of the mutually facing<br>
surfaces of the clamping frame elements,<br>
 (c) moving the tool parts together relative to each<br>
other arid carrying out the press molding in the<br>
region of the molding contours 13, 14 of the tool<br>
parts 11, 12,<br>
(d) cutting off an excess length of at least one of<br>
the two material layers, which excess length is<br>
present between the first and the second tool<br>
part, by means of a blade 330 of a cutting device<br>
100, the blade being moved during the cutting<br>
operation in such a manner that a corresponding<br>
region of the bearing region 23a of the second<br>
clamping frame element 22, 23, which bearing<br>
region faces the cutting edge 350 of the blade<br>
330, acts as the counterposition 323c for the<br>
cutting edge 350 during the cutting operation,<br>
(e) moving the tool parts 11, 12 and the clamping<br>
frame elements 21, 22 apart in order to be able to<br>
remove the press-molded and interconnected<br>
material layers 1, 2 from the tool.<br>
Before the material layers 1, 2 are placed between the<br>
tool parts, heating of the first or of the second<br>
material layer can take place.<br><br><br><br><br>
