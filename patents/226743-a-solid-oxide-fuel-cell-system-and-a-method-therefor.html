				<td>A SOLID OXIDE FUEL CELL SYSTEM AND A METHOD THEREFOR<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is generally directed to a solid oxide fuel cell system (SOFC's),<br>
and more specifically to SOFC's having a circulation of a portion of the anode tail gas (i.e.<br>
exhaust).<br>
The circulation of a portion of the anode exhaust is known in the solid oxide fuel cell<br>
field. This technique is used to provide water to the hydrocarbon fuel inlet of the SOFC to<br>
support the steam reforming of the hydrocarbon fuel. Two methods are known for<br>
conducting this anode circulation.<br>
In the first method, a portion of the anode exhaust is simply injected back to the<br>
SOFC fuel inlet by aspiration or with a mechanical blower. In this case the composition of<br>
the anode inlet injected gas stream is similar to the anode exhaust stream. The<br>
composition of the exhaust stream is a function of the type of fuel used, the effectiveness<br>
of the reforming process, the fuel stoichiometry, and the circulation rate. The composition<br>
of the anode exhaust will typically contain water, carbon dioxide and non reacted fuel (i.e.,<br>
hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and primary fuel feedstock)<br>
In the second method, the anode exhaust is mixed with a portion of the<br>
cathode exhaust and a portion of this gas stream is injected into the SOFC fuel inlet<br>
by aspiration or with a mechanical blower. In this case, the composition of the anode<br>
inlet injected gas stream is modified from the anode exhaust. In general, the<br>
composition of the anode inlet injected gas, resulting from partial combining the<br>
anode and cathode exhausts, will have a lower fuel content (i.e., hydrogen, carbon<br>
monoxide, and primary fuel feedstock) and higher water and carbon dioxide content.<br>
Additionally, if as typical, the cathode oxygen source is from ambient air,<br><br>
there will be a quantity of nitrogen in the anode inlet injected gas not normally existent<br>
within the anode inlet injected gas from simple partial anode exhaust circulation.<br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
[0009] FIG. 1 is a system schematic of the major SOFC components of<br>
the first preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br><br>
[0010] FIG. 2 is a system schematic of the major SOFC-components of<br>
the second preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0011] The present inventor has realized that even with the injection of<br>
exhaust gases into the anode inlet, several problems in conducting<br>
internal reforming within the active area of the SOFC cells still exists in<br>
the prior art methods.<br>
[0012] First, because the SOFC operates at an elevated temperature,<br>
steam reforming of the fuel (i.e., methane as an example) occurs within<br>
the SOFC stack fuel inlet manifold. As much as 80% of the reforming can<br>
be completed before the fuel gas mixture reaches the active cell area.<br>
This negates much of the significant advantage of endothermic internal<br>
reforming relative to the lowering of cooling airflow requirements and the<br>
leveling of the thermal gradients.<br>
[0013] Second, even if the fuel steam reformation within the SOFC fuel<br>
inlet manifold was avoided, the fuel steam reaction can overwhelm the<br>
fuel cell oxidation reaction with most of the reforming occurring near the<br>
fuel inlet active area leading to negative results. These negative results<br>
include misdistribution of current density, higher thermal gradients and<br>
poorer performance.<br>
[0014] Third, the gas injected into the anode inlet contains a significant<br>
portion of carbon dioxide or carbon dioxide and nitrogen. This negatively<br>
impacts the system performance in two characteristics. A pressure drop<br>
across the anode flow field is increased, which in turn increases the<br>
blower parasitic power, and the fuel is diluted to a lower partial pressure<br>
reducing the cell performance.<br><br>
[0015] The present inventor has realized that a use of selective rather<br>
than total circulation of the anode exhaust gas species in a SOFC reduce<br>
or eliminate the problems of the prior art methods. The present inventor<br>
has devised methods for shifting the methane/steam reforming equilibrium<br>
such that reforming within the fuel manifold is minimized and the fuel cell<br>
oxidation is encouraged or even preferred over the methane/steam<br>
reformation reaction.<br>
[0016] The terms anode exhaust, fuel exhaust, anode outlet and fuel<br>
outlet are used interchangeably herein. Likewise, the terms anode inlet<br>
and fuel inlet are also used interchangeably.<br>
[0017] In the selective circulation of the SOFC anode exhaust, only<br>
hydrogen and water are sequestered from the fuel or anode exhaust or<br>
outlet stream and injected into the SOFC fuel inlet stream, while all but<br>
trace quantities of carbon dioxide and any existing nitrogen are<br>
exhausted. Additionally, the proportions of the hydrogen and water<br>
injected can be varied independently of each other. For example the<br>
amount of hydrogen injected into the SOFC fuel inlet can be increased<br>
while the water injected into the SOFC fuel inlet is reduced or vice versa.<br>
Also the hydrogen and water injected into the SOFC fuel inlet can both be<br>
increased or decreased together, but to different degrees. In summary, a<br>
complete and independent flow rate control of injected hydrogen and<br>
water into the SOFC fuel inlet stream is possible while blocking the<br>
injection of carbon dioxide and nitrogen into the fuel inlet stream.<br>
[0018] By selecting a high hydrogen flow rate and a lower water flow<br>
rate from the anode exhaust gas for circulation into the SOFC fuel inlet,<br>
the suppression of manifold methane/steam reforming within the fuel inlet<br>
manifold results. At the same time, the high hydrogen content of the<br>
SOFC fuel inlet enhances the fuel cell oxidation reaction and encourages a<br>
leveling of the in-cell methane/steam reforming. The combination of the<br><br>
endothermic methane/steam reforming reaction with the exothermic SOFC<br>
fuel cell reaction, within the cell active area, produces about half the net<br>
heat normally produced by just the SOFC fuel cell.<br>
[0019] Since the heat generated by the fuel cell is primarily rejected<br>
from the SOFC with the cathode air flow, this flow rate can be reduced<br>
by about half. This has a positive impact on the parasitic power for the air<br>
blower and the size of the air heat exchanger.<br>
[0020] In a first preferred embodiment of the SOFC system with a<br>
selective anode tail gas circulation, the water (such as water vapor) and<br>
hydrogen are recovered from the fuel exhaust or outlet stream in separate<br>
stages using separate devices. The water is transferred from the anode<br>
exhaust to the SOFC inlet fuel using a rotating desiccant enthalpy wheel.<br>
The rate of the water transferred within the enthalpy wheel is controlled<br>
by the rotational speed. The water circulation is preferably controlled<br>
without using aspirators or blowers.<br>
[0021] Also in the first embodiment of the SOFC with selective anode<br>
tail gas circulation, the hydrogen is transferred from the anode exhaust to<br>
the SOFC fuel inlet stream using an electrochemical hydrogen pump. The<br>
rate of hydrogen transferred within the electrochemical hydrogen pump is<br>
directly proportional to the cell current. The hydrogen circulation is<br>
preferably controlled without using aspirators or blowers.<br>
[0022] In the second embodiment of the SOFC system with selective<br>
anode tail gas circulation, the hydrogen and water are independently<br>
separated from the SOFC anode exhaust using thermally driven<br>
absorption/adsorption processes. The circulation flow rate of the<br>
hydrogen and water are controlled by mechanical devices such as blowers<br>
and/or pumps. The high quality waste heat of the SOfC allows the<br><br>
separation of exhaust gas species without significant parasitic electric<br>
power usage.<br>
[0023] The SOFC system 10 of the first preferred embodiment is shown<br>
in Fig. 1 as a simplified system schematic. The SOFC of system 10<br>
includes a cathode chamber 14, a cathode electrode 15, a ceramic<br>
electrolyte 16, an anode electrode containing an anode catalyst 17 and an<br>
anode chamber 27. While only one SOFC is shown in Figure 1 for clarity,<br>
it should be understood that the system 10 preferably contains a stack of<br>
SOFCs. The SOFC system 10 also contains a fuel supply inlet conduit<br>
(i.e., an anode inlet conduit) containing conduit portions 20, 22, 24 and<br>
26, and a fuel exhaust outlet conduit (i.e., an anode outlet conduit)<br>
containing conduit portions 28, 29, 30 and 31.<br>
[0024] The SOFC system 10 also contains a hydrogen recovery unit 21<br>
which transfers hydrogen gas from within a gas mixture into a secondary<br>
gas stream. The hydrogen recovery unit 21 may be any suitable selective<br>
hydrogen recovery device. Preferably, unit 21 is a device based on an<br>
electrochemical proton exchange process (i.e., an electrochemical proton<br>
exchange pump), such as a polymeric or ceramic proton exchange<br>
membrane, or a device which uses pressure swing absorption for<br>
selective hydrogen recovery. The SOFC system 10 also contains a water<br>
vapor and enthalpy recovery unit 23. The water vapor and enthalpy<br>
recovery unit 23 may be any device which selectively transfers water<br>
vapor from one gas stream to a secondary gas stream. The water vapor<br>
and enthalpy recovery unit 23 is preferably a device which contains a<br>
rotating desiccant wheel (also known as an enthalpy wheel) or cyclic<br>
desiccant beds. The rate of rotation of the desiccant wheel controls the<br>
amount of water vapor transferred by the device. Heat exchanger 25 is a<br>
counter flow gas-gas heat exchanger.<br><br>
[0025] The units 21 and 23 are operatively connected to the fuel supply<br>
inlet conduit and to the fuel exhaust outlet conduit. Thus, the units 21<br>
and 23 are either directly connected to the inlet and outlet conduits or<br>
indirectly connected to the inlet and outlet conduits by respective water<br>
and hydrogen delivery conduits. A method of operating the system 10 is<br>
described below.<br>
[0026] As shown in Fig. 1, air containing reactant oxygen is delivered<br>
by a blower (not shown) to the cathode heat exchanger 12 through<br>
conduit 11. Within the cathode heat exchanger 12 fuel cell waste heat is<br>
exchanged into the cathode inlet air raising the air temperature close to<br>
the cell operating temperature. The heated air is then delivered to the<br>
cathode chamber 14 through conduit 13. Within the cathode chamber 14<br>
the oxygen gas within the air contacts the cathode electrode 15 and<br>
becomes oxygen ions with the addition of electrons. The oxygen ions<br>
pass through the solid oxide electrolyte 16 and are available on the anode<br>
catalyst 17 to oxidize available fuel. As the air flows through the cathode<br>
chamber 14 the air is partly depleted of oxygen and its temperature is<br>
increased from the waste heat generated within the fuel cell. The<br>
temperature rise across the cathode chamber can be as much as 200C<br>
depending on the fuel cell current, operating voltage, degree of internal<br>
fuel reforming and the flow rates of the exhaust gases. The cathode air<br>
exhaust from cathode chamber 14 is directed back to the cathode heat<br>
exchanger 12 through conduit 18. Within heat exchanger 12, heat is<br>
transferred from the exhaust air stream to the air inlet stream in a counter<br>
flow arrangement. The cooled exhaust air is then discharged from heat<br>
exchanger 12 through conduit 19.<br>
[0027] A hydrocarbon fuel, such as methane gas and/or another suitable<br>
hydrocarbon or hydrogen gas, is introduced into the SOFC system 10<br>
through conduit 20 into hydrogen recovery unit 21. The fuel may be<br><br>
located in a fuel storage vessel, such as a methane storage vessel,<br>
connected to conduit 20. Within hydrogen recovery unit 21 hydrogen gas<br>
is transferred from the outlet stream (i.e., the fuel exhaust stream) into<br>
the hydrocarbon fuel inlet stream. This hydrogen supports a uniform<br>
methane reformation process within the anode catalyst 17. The methane<br>
and hydrogen mixture {i.e., the fuel inlet stream) flows from the hydrogen<br>
recovery unit 21 into the enthalpy recovery unit 23 through conduit 22.<br>
[0028] Within the water vapor and enthalpy recovery unit 23, a portion<br>
of the water vapor is transferred from the exhaust or outlet stream into<br>
the methane hydrogen inlet stream. From the water vapor and enthalpy<br>
recovery unit 23, the methane, hydrogen and water vapor mixture (i.e.,<br>
the inlet stream) is introduced into heat exchanger 25 through conduit 24.<br>
In the heat exchanger 25, the gas mixture temperature is increased near<br>
to the operational temperature of about 600 to 1000 C, such as 800 C,<br>
using the high temperature waste heat from the exhaust stream. From<br>
heat exchanger 25, the hot mixture of methane, hydrogen, and water<br>
vapor (i.e., the inlet stream) is delivered to the anode chamber 27 through<br>
conduit 26. Some steam reformation of the methane will occur in the heat<br>
exchanger 25 and conduit 26, but the amount is suppressed by the<br>
existence of the hydrogen. The completion of the steam reforming of the<br>
methane is accomplished in the anode catalyst 17.<br>
[0029] Within the anode catalyst 17, the steam reforming of methane<br>
and the oxidation of carbon and hydrogen in the fuel cell reactions<br>
convert the discharged gas mixture to carbon dioxide, additional water<br>
vapor, and excess hydrogen. The discharged gas mixture (i.e., the<br>
exhaust or outlet stream) flows to heat exchanger 25 through conduit 28,<br>
releasing waste heat. The discharged gas mixture (i.e., the exhaust or<br>
outlet stream) then flows through conduit 29 to the enthalpy recovery<br>
unit 23 to supply a portion of the water vapor to support the input<br><br>
methane reformation. The discharged gas mixture (i.e., the exhaust<br>
stream) is then directed to the hydrogen recovery unit 21 through conduit<br>
30, where a selected amount of the hydrogen is transferred to the<br>
methane inlet stream. Using the electrochemical proton exchange<br>
process as the hydrogen recovery unit 21 is preferred because it provides<br>
a measure of the hydrogen content within the discharged gas mixture<br>
which can be used to adjust the input methane flow rate. However, other<br>
hydrogen recovery devices may also be used. Preferably, the hydrogen<br>
recovery unit 21 is located separately from the water vapor and enthalpy<br>
recovery unit 23 and the hydrogen recovery unit is located further<br>
downstream from the water vapor and enthalpy recovery unit relative to<br>
the solid oxide fuel cell stack, such that hydrogen is introduced into the<br>
fuel inlet stream before water vapor. The exhaust stream from hydrogen<br>
recovery unit 21 containing mostly carbon dioxide, water, and a small<br>
quantity of non-reacted fuel, is discharged from the SOFC system 10<br>
through conduit 31.<br>
[0030] The SOFC system 40 of the second preferred embodiment is<br>
shown in Fig. 2 as a simplified system schematic. System 40 contains<br>
the same components as system 10 of the first embodiment, except that<br>
the hydrogen recovery unit 21 and the water vapor and enthalpy recovery<br>
unit 23 are replaced with a fuel exhaust processing subsystem 41. The<br>
subsystem 41 is operatively (i.e., directly or indirectly) connected to the<br>
fuel supply inlet conduit and to the fuel exhaust outlet conduit. The SOFC<br>
system 40 also contains a fuel supply inlet conduit (i.e., an anode inlet<br>
conduit) containing conduit portions 20, 22, 24 and 26 (conduit portions<br>
20, 22 and 24 may comprise a single continuous conduit, if desired) and<br>
a fuel exhaust outlet conduit (i.e., an anode outlet conduit) containing<br>
conduit portions 28, 29 and 31. Hydrogen deliver conduit 43 and water<br>
vapor delivery conduit 42 connect the subsystem 41 with the fuel supply<br>
inlet conduit.<br><br>
[0031] The fuel exhaust processing subsystem 41 preferably contains a<br>
carbon dioxide scrubbing unit, a water vapor recovery unit and a<br>
hydrogen recovery unit. The carbon dioxide scrubbing unit removes at<br>
least a portion of carbon dioxide present in the fuel exhaust to form a<br>
scrubbed fuel exhaust or outlet stream. The water vapor recovery unit<br>
transfers at least a portion of water vapor from the scrubbed exhaust<br>
stream to the hydrocarbon fuel inlet stream. The hydrogen recovery unit<br>
is adapted to transfer at least a portion of hydrogen from the scrubbed<br>
fuel exhaust stream to the hydrocarbon fuel inlet steam. Thus, in the<br>
system of the second preferred embodiment, a single subsystem 41 can<br>
be used to separate hydrogen and water vapor from the fuel exhaust or<br>
outlet stream. Preferably, the subsystem 41 is an absorption/adsorption<br>
gas recovery and separation subsystem which separates hydrogen and<br>
water vapor based on absorption/adsorption techniques, such as a device<br>
containing an adsorption based gas separation column and/or a polymeric<br>
gas separation membrane. Alternatively, the subsystem 41 may comprise<br>
a molecular sieve.<br>
[0032] Preferably, a carbon dioxide scrubbing unit is used to remove at<br>
least a portion of carbon dioxide from the exhaust stream prior to<br>
separating the water vapor and hydrogen from the exhaust stream. Thus,<br>
the method of the second preferred embodiment preferably includes<br>
removing at least a portion of carbon dioxide present in the fuel exhaust<br>
or outlet stream to form a scrubbed fuel exhaust and providing at least a<br>
portion of the scrubbed fuel exhaust into the hydrocarbon fuel inlet<br>
stream, such as providing a portion of hydrogen and water vapor from the<br>
scrubbed fuel exhaust into the fuel inlet stream. Preferably, about 45%<br>
to about 55%, such as about 50% of the hydrogen and water vapor<br>
recovered from the scrubbed fuel exhaust are provided separately into the<br>
hydrocarbon fuel inlet stream to obtain a fuel utilization of about 70 to<br>
about 80%.<br><br>
[0033] A method of operating the system 40 is described with respect<br>
to Fig. 2. Air containing reactant oxygen is delivered by a blower (not<br>
shown) to the cathode heat exchanger 12 through conduit 11. Within the<br>
cathode heat exchanger 12, fuel cell waste heat is exchanged into the<br>
cathode inlet air raising the air temperature close to the cell operating<br>
temperature. The heated air is then delivered to the SOFC cathode<br>
chamber 14, through conduit 13. Within the cathode chamber 14, the<br>
oxygen gas within the air contacts the cathode electrode 15 and becomes<br>
oxygen ions with the addition of electrons. The oxygen ions pass through<br>
the solid oxide electrolyte 16 and are available on the anode catalyst 17<br>
to oxidize available fuel. As the air flows through the cathode chamber 14<br>
the air is partly depleted of oxygen and its temperature is increased from<br>
the waste heat generated within the fuel cell. The temperature rise across<br>
the cathode chamber can be as much as 200C depending on the fuel cell<br>
current, operating voltage, degree of internal fuel reforming and the flow<br>
rates of the exhaust gases. The cathode air exhaust from cathode<br>
chamber 14 is directed back to the cathode heat exchanger 12 through<br>
conduit 18. Within heat exchanger 12 heat is transferred from the<br>
exhaust air stream to the air inlet stream in a counter flow arrangement.<br>
The cooled exhaust air is then discharged from heat exchanger 12<br>
through conduit 19.<br>
[0034] A hydrocarbon fuel, such as methane gas, is introduced into the<br>
SOFC system 40 through conduit 20. Hydrogen is injected into the<br>
methane gas inlet stream through conduit 43. This hydrogen supports a<br>
uniform methane reformation process within the anode catalyst 17. The<br>
methane and hydrogen mixture (i.e., inlet stream) flows through conduit<br>
22. Water is injected into inlet stream through conduit 42 and the<br>
methane, hydrogen and water mixture (i.e., the inlet stream) flows<br>
through conduit 24 to heat exchanger 25. In the heat exchanger 215, the<br>
mixture temperature is increased near to an operational temperature of<br><br>
about 600 C to about 1000 C, such as about 800 C, using the high<br>
temperature waste heat from the exhaust stream. From heat exchanger<br>
25, the hot mixture of methane, hydrogen, and water vapor (i.e., the inlet<br>
stream) is delivered to the SOFC anode chamber 27 through conduit 26.<br>
Some steam reformation of the methane will occur in the heat exchanger<br>
25 and conduit 26 but the amount is suppressed by the existence of the<br>
hydrogen. The completion of the steam reforming of the methane is<br>
accomplished in the anode catalyst 17.<br>
[0035] Within the anode catalyst 17, the steam reforming of methane<br>
and the oxidation of carbon and hydrogen in the fuel cell reactions<br>
convert the discharged gas mixture (i.e., the exhaust stream) to carbon<br>
dioxide, additional water vapor, and excess hydrogen. The discharged gas<br>
mixture (i.e., the exhaust stream) flows to heat exchanger 25 through<br>
conduit 26, releasing waste heat. The exhaust stream then flows through<br>
conduit 29 to fuel exhaust processing subsystem 41. The fuel exhaust<br>
processing subsystem 41 separates hydrogen and water from carbon<br>
dioxide and other non-reacted fuel using absorption/adsorption or other<br>
suitable techniques. A portion of the separated water is injected into a<br>
water vapor delivery conduit 42 to supply water into the fuel inlet stream<br>
flowing through conduit 22 to support the input methane reformation.<br>
The separated hydrogen is injected into a hydrogen delivery conduit 43 to<br>
supply hydrogen into the fuel inlet stream flowing through conduit 22 to<br>
modify the methane steam reforming equilibrium. Preferably, the water<br>
vapor delivery conduit 42 is located further upstream from the hydrogen<br>
delivery conduit 43 relative to the solid oxide fuel cell stack, such that the<br>
hydrogen is delivered into the fuel inlet stream before water vapor. The<br>
exhaust mixture from fuel exhaust processing subsystem 41, containing<br>
mostly carbon dioxide, water, and a small quantity of non-reacted fuel, is<br>
discharged from the SOFC system 40 through conduit 31.<br><br>
[0036] In the methods of the first and second preferred embodiment,<br>
hydrogen may be provided into the fuel inlet stream without providing<br>
carbon dioxide which is present in the fuel exhaust stream into the fuel<br>
inlet stream. Furthermore, if desired, only a portion of the hydrogen<br>
and/or water vapor present in the fuel exhaust stream may be provided<br>
into the fuel inlet stream. The methods and systems of the first and<br>
second preferred embodiments allow control of an amount of water vapor<br>
provided into the hydrocarbon fuel to decrease or prevent reforming of the<br>
hydrocarbon fuel and water vapor in a fuel inlet conduit upstream from<br>
the solid oxide fuel cell stack. The control of the water vapor transfer<br>
may be achieved by the rotation rate of a desiccant wheel of the first<br>
embodiment or control of the absorption/adsorption cycle of the second<br>
embodiment. For example, the methods of the first and second preferred<br>
embodiments may be controlled to provide a sufficient amount of water<br>
vapor into the hydrocarbon fuel inlet stream such that the water vapor<br>
and hydrocarbon fuel mixture inlet stream contains less than two water<br>
molecules for each carbon atom, preferably 1.5 or less water molecules<br>
for each carbon atom. The hydrocarbon fuel and the water vapor can be<br>
reformed in the solid oxide fuel cell stack in parallel with an oxidation<br>
reaction proceeding in the solid oxide fuel cell stack. Preferably, about<br>
45% to about 55%, such as about 50% of the hydrogen and water vapor<br>
recovered from the scrubbed fuel exhaust are provided separately into the<br>
hydrocarbon fuel inlet stream to obtain a fuel utilization of about 70 to<br>
about 80%. The term "about" provides a variation based on given<br>
processes variables, such as a variation of 10% or less, preferably 5% or<br>
less.<br>
