DETAILED DESCRIPTION <br>
The embodiments described below provide for control channel encoding that can efficiently transmit preamble information bits.    The embodiments use tail-biting convolutional coding and CRC coupled with modulation schemes such as BPSK,<br><br><br>
QPSK or QAM. The embodiments described below are generally described in terms of QPSK; however, it will be understood that this does not exclude the use of other modulation techniques and is simply done for convenience<br>
Further, after tail-biting convolutional encoding and modulation, the modulated symbols can be further transformed according to the air interface standard being implemented, e.g., CDMA or OFDM, for transmission. For example, the signal can be transformed into an OFDM subcarrier waveform, e.g., with or without multiple antennas (Multiple In Multiple Out (MIMO)) or beam-forming.<br>
Implementation of the embodiments described below result in a frame structure with reduced overhead symbols, which allows for increased capability and a more efficient design. Further, such a frame structure requires lower transmission power or a lower signal to noise (Eb/NO) ratio in the receiver to achieve similar false alarm and missing detection performance as conventional solutions. Additionally, in some embodiments, it is unnecessary to make any tradeoff between false alarm and missing detection probabilities, because the CRC bit, as well as the information bits in certain implementations, including user information, transmission format information, and/or subcarrier or channelization code, etc., can be used to check errors. In some embodiments, the factors influencing the tradeoff between false alarm rates and missing detection probabilities include the number of CRC bits and the required false alarm rate. If the number of CRC bits is too few to provide a low false alarm rate, the tradeoff still exists.<br>
The embodiments described herein can be used to implement various control channels in a, e.g., UMB system.   Accordingly, the requirements for a particular<br><br><br>
channel should be taken into consideration when implementing the embodiments described herein.<br>
Figure 1 is a diagram illustrating an example control channel encoder 100 configured in accordance with one embodiment of the systems and methods described herein. The encoder of figure 1 can be included, for example, in a forward link or reverse link transmitter in a UHDR -DO system. For example, encoder 100 can be used on the forward link to transmit the Forward-Pilot Quality Indicator Channel (F-PQICH to wireless communication devices. Alternatively, the encoder 100 can be used on the reverse link to transmit the Reverse-CDMA Dedicated Control Channel(R-CDCCH), or the Reverse-Shared Control Channel (R-SCCH), to a receiver. It will be understood that the encoder of figure 1, as with all embodiments described herein, can be implemented in software, hardware, or some combination thereof.<br>
Thus, the encoder of figure 1 can be used to encode the indication information, e.g. the strength of reverse link pilots of each active terminal (in F-PQICH), which is often provided as 4-bits of information. As can be seen, encoder 100 comprises a CRC block 102 configured to receive the, e.g., 4-bit indictor to generate a certain number of bits (b). CRC block 102 is configured to then add CRC bits (c) to the sequence of input data bits (b). In the example of figure 1, a 4-bit indicator generates a 4-bit data stream. Two CRC bits (c) are added to the input bits (b) to form a 6-bit symbol that is then input to tail biting convolutional encoder 104. In certain implementations, the use of inverted CRC bits (c) can provide a slight performance improvement; however, it will be understood that in other embodiments, non-inverted<br><br><br>
CRC bits (c) can be added in CRC block 102. CRC bits can be used for alarm or missing detection probability determination in the receiver. An example implementation of CRC block 104 is described in more detail below.<br>
The output of CRC block 102 will then comprise (b+c) bits and will be input to tail biting convolutional encoder 104. As will be understood, a convolutional encoder converts (k) input bits, in this case k=b+c, into a sequence of (n) bits. The n-bit sequence, or symbol, can then be used to determine the k bits in the receiver. Thus, the effective rate (R) of encoder 102 is R=k/n.<br>
It will be understood that in a conventional convolutional encoder, a tail sequence must be added to the end of the generated sequence in order to properly end the encoding process. The tail sequence is typically a series of "0's," which add to the overhead associated with the data control channel. Tail biting means that the encoder starts in the state given by the (m) last bits of the information sequence, where m is the size of the memory, or length of the register included in the encoder. Hence, the encoder starts and ends in the same state and thus the loss in rate of the code associated with conventional convolutional encoders is eliminated. In other words, the need for the tail sequence can be eliminated, which reduces overhead.<br>
In certain embodiments, the convolutional encoding generator polynomials can be, e.g., 0157 and 0127 in octet.<br>
The output of tail biting convolutional encoder 104 is then input to block interleaver 106. Interleaving is a way to arrange data in a non-contiguous way in order to increase performance. Interleaving is mainly used in digital data transmission technology to protect the transmission against burst errors. These errors<br><br><br>
overwrite a lot of bits in a row, but seldom occur. Interleaving is used to solve this problem. All data is transmitted with some control bits (independently from the interleaving), such as error correction bits that enable the channel decoder to correct a certain number of altered bits. If a burst error occurs, and more than this number of bits is altered, the codeword cannot be correctly decoded. So the bits of a number of codewords, or symbols are interleaved and then transmitted. This way, a burst error affects only a correctable number of bits in each codeword, so the decoder can decode the codewords correctly.<br>
The output of block interleaver 106 can then be modulated, e.g., using QPSK, and then mapped to certain OFDM tones for transmission as described in more detail below. During transmission, diversity gain should be exploited as much as possible. Accordingly, e.g., F-PQICH symbols can be transmitted on 3 tiles. Moreover, improved minimum Euclidian distance can be achieved using tail biting convolutional encoding and, e.g., inverted CRC bits as illustrated in figure 1. For example, a minimum Euclidian distance of 12 can be achieved.<br>
Figure 2 is a diagram illustrating an example control channel encoder 100 configured in accordance with one embodiment of the systems and methods described herein. The encoder of figure 1 can be included, for example, in a forward link or reverse link transmitter in a UHDR -DO system. Specifically, encoder 100 can be used on the forward link to transmit the Forward-Pilot Quality Indicator Channel (F-PQICH), the Forward-Fast Other Sector Interference Channel (F-FOSICH), or the Forward Interference Over Thermal Channel (F-IOTCH) to wireless communication devices.  Alternatively, the encoder 100 can be used on the reverse link to transmit<br><br><br>
the Reverse-CDMA Dedicated Control Channel(R-CDCCH), or the Reverse-Shared Control Channel (R-SCCH), to a receiver.<br>
It will be understood that the encoder of figure 2, as with all embodiments described herein, can be implemented in software, hardware, or some combination thereof.<br>
Thus, the encoder of figure 2 can be used to encode the indication information, e.g. the other sector interference indication (in F-OSICH), or the interference over thermal information (in F-IOTCH), often 4-bits. Each of these channels can require a low error rate, e.g., approximately as low as 1%, but can also tolerate a high error rate, e.g., approximately as high as 10%.<br>
As can be seen, encoder 100 comprises a CRC block 102 configured to receive the, e.g., 4-bit indictor to generate a certain number of bits (b). CRC block 102 is configured to then add CRC bits (c) to the sequence of input data bits (b). In the example of figure 1, a 4-bit indicator generates a 4-bit data stream. Two CRC bits (c) are added to the input bits (b) to form a 6-bit symbol that is then input to tail biting convolutional encoder 104. In certain implementations, the use of inverted CRC bits (c) can provide a slight performance improvement; however, it will be understood that in other embodiments, non-inverted CRC bits (c) can be added in CRC block 102. CRC bits can be used for alarm or missing detection probability determination in the receiver. An example implementation of CRC block 104 is described in more detail below.<br>
The output of CRC block 102 will then comprise (b+c) bits and will be input to tail biting convolutional encoder 104. As will be understood, a convolutional encoder<br><br><br>
converts (k) input bits, in this case k=b+c, into a sequence of (n) bits. The n-bit sequence, or symbol, can then used to determine the k bits in the receiver. Thus, the effective rate (R) of encoder 102 is R=k/n.<br>
The output of tail biting convolutional encoder 104 can then be modulated, e.g., using QPSK, and then mapped to certain OFDM tones for transmission as described in more detail below. As with the embodiment of figure 1, the embodiments of figure 2 can provide increased minimum Euclidian distance, e.g., of 12, which can provide good erasure probability and low word error rate. Also, as with the embodiment of figure 1, the generator polynomials of, e.g., 0157 and 0127 in octet can be used.<br>
Figure 3 is a diagram illustrating an example implementation of CRC block 102 or 202 in accordance with one embodiment. As can be seen, the CRC block implementation of figure 3 comprises an input 301 at which the input bits (b) are received and an output 303 at which the output bits (k) are presented. The CRC block implementation of figure 3 further comprises 3 switches 308a, 308b, and 308c, which are in the up position while the information bits (b) are being received. Thus, the input bits (b) will simply be passed from input 301 to output 303.<br>
In order to add the CRC bits, switches 308a, 308b, and 308c are moved to the down position, connecting inputs 305 and 307 with the encoder section 300. In this example, inputs 305 and 307 are configured to feed "0's" to encoder section 300. Encoder section 300 comprises 2 one-bit storage registers 302a and 302b, which are configured to store the input to each register for one clock cycle and then shift the input out to the right, and 1 modulo-2 adders 304. The output of adder 304 is then to<br><br><br>
output 303. In the example of figure 1, two CRC bits (c) are added to the information bits (b).<br>
Figure 4 is a diagram illustrating an example implementation of CRC block 102 or 202 in accordance with another embodiment. As can be seen, the CRC block implementation of figure 4 comprises an input 401 at which the input bits (b) are received and an output 403 at which the output bits (k) are presented. The CRC block implementation of figure 4 further comprises 3 switches 408a, 408b, and 408c, which are in the up position while the information bits (b) are being received. Thus, the input bits (b) will simply be passed from input 401 to output 403.<br>
In order to add the CRC bits, switches 408a, 408b, and 408c are moved to the down position, connecting inputs 405 and 407 with the encoder section 400. In this example, inputs 405 and 407 are configured to feed "0's" to encoder section 400. Encoder section 400 comprises 2 one-bit storage registers 402a and 402b, which are configured to store the input to each register for one clock cycle and then shift the input out to the right, and 1 modulo-2 adders 404. The output of adder 404 is then input to inverter 406, which is configured to invert the output of adder 404 and pass the inverted result to output 403. In the example of figure 1, two inverted CRC bits (c) are added to the information bits (b).<br>
Figure 5 is a flow chart illustrating an example method for encoding a control channel in accordance with one embodiment of the systems and methods described herein. First, in step 502, the data bits (b) are generated. In step 504, CRC bits (c) can be generated from, and added to the data bits (b). In step 506, the resulting input symbols can be encoded using a tail-biting convolutional encoding process to<br><br><br>
generate output symbols. In certain embodiments, the output symbols can be interleaved in step 508. The output can then be modulated, e.g., using BPSK, QPSK, QAM, etc., in step 510. Finally, the modulated output can then be further modulated for transmission, e.g., using CDMA or OFDM, in step 512.<br>
Figure 6 is a flow chart illustrating an example method for encoding a control channel in accordance with one embodiment of the systems and methods described herein. First, in step 602, the data bits (b) are generated. In step 604, CRC bits (c) can be generated from, and added to the data bits (b). In step 606, the resulting input symbols can be encoded using a tail-biting convolutional encoding process to generate output symbols. In step 608, the output symbols (k) can be converted into a sequence of (n) bits using the formula R=k/n, wherein (R) is the effective rate of the encoder and k= b+c, wherein (b) is a plurality of bits generated by the CRC from the information bits and (c) is the number of CRC bits generated by the CRC encoding block. The output symbols of step 608 can be interleaved in step 610. In some embodiments, the output symbols of step 606 can be interleaved before converting into a sequence of (n) bits in step 608. The output can then be modulated, e.g., using BPSK, QPSK, QAM, etc., in step 612. Finally, the modulated output can then be further modulated for transmission, e.g., using CDMA or OFDM, in step 614.<br>
Figure 7 is a flow chart illustrating an example method for encoding a control channel in accordance with one embodiment of the systems and methods described herein. First, in step 702, the data bits (b) are generated. In step 704, CRC bits (c) can be generated from, and added to the data bits (b). In step 706, the resulting input symbols can be encoded using a tail-biting convolutional encoding process to<br><br><br>
generate output symbols. The output can then be modulated, e.g., using BPSK, QPSK, QAM, etc., in step 710. Finally, the modulated output can then be further modulated for transmission, e.g., using CDMA or OFDM, in step 712.<br>
As noted, the control channel encoding can be performed in a base station, or an access point for communicating the control to wireless communication devices with which it is in communication. It should also be noted that for best performance, the diversity, e.g., in time and/or frequency should be maximized.<br>

ABSTRACT<br>
A control channel encoder, e.g., in a UMB system, uses a channel structure that can efficiently transmit more information bits, yet achieve sufficient detection and false alarm performance. The control channel encoder uses tail-biting convolutional coding and Cyclical Redundancy Check (CRC).<br><br></td>
