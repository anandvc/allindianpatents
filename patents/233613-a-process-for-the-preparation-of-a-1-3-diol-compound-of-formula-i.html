				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing cis-l,3-diols. More particularly, the present invention relates to the use and subsequent recovery and reuse of a trialkylborane or dialkylalkoxyborane or a mixture of a trialkylborane and a dialkylalkoxyborane in the reduction of a beta-hydroxy ketone to obtain a cis-l,3-diol. Additionally, the present invention relates to the use of a synergistic combination of a trialkylborane and a dialkylalkoxyborane in the reduction of a beta-hydroxy ketone to obtain a cis-l,3-diol.<br>
The use of trialkylboranes or dialkylalkoxyboranes in the stereoselective reduction of 1,3-keto alcohols to the corresponding syn-l,3-diols has been widely described in the literature. This method has given high stereoselectivity without using extraordinarily difficult conditions (Brower P.L., Butler D.E., Deering C.F., Le T.V., Millar A., Nanninga T.N., and Roth B., Tetrahedron Lett., 1992;33:2279; Narasaka K., and Pai F.C., Tetrahedron, 1984;40:2233; Chen K.M., Hardtmann G.E., Prasad K., Repic O., and Shapiro M.J., Tetrahedron Lett., 1987;28:155; Chen K.M., Gunderson K.G., Hardtmann G.E., Prasad K., Repic O., and Shapiro M.J., Chem. Lett., 1987:1923). There seems to be general acceptance of the formation of a borate ester from either the trialkyl or dialkylalkoxyboranes which is said to form a cyclic chelate (Narasaka K. and Pai F.C., Tetrahedron, 1984;40:2233; Chen K.M., Hardtmann G.E., Prasad K., Repic O., and Shapiro M.J., Tetrahedron Lett., 1987;28:155; Chen K.M., Gunderson K.G., Hardtmann G.E., Prasad K., Repic O., and Shapiro M.J., Chem. Lett., 1987:1923; see for example Paterson I., Cumming J.G., and Smith J.D., Tetrahedron Lett., 1994;35:3405). Axial delivery of a hydride to the complex then leads predominately to the syn-product which can be hydrolyzed to the diol. The diols are valued as intermediates for the preparation of, for example, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors which are useful hypolipidemic and hypocholesterolemic agents. This is a widely used method of preparation of such agents (U.S. Patents 4,645,854, 5,354,772, 5,155,251, and 4,970,313).<br>
Many procedures in the literature, describe the work-up of the reaction with hydrogen peroxide (U.S. Patents 4,645,854 and 4,970,313). This results in the destruction of active alkylborane species. Some procedures describe the repeated distillation with methanol and an acid (U.S. Patents 5,354,772 and 5,155,251). This also dilutes and eventually destroys the active alkylborane species. We have surprisingly and unexpectedly found that by performing the reduction and workup with a minimal amount of acid, and keeping the distillate streams separated, that the initial distillate can be recovered and reused to obtain very good selectivity in subsequent reductions.<br>
Thus, the present process offers significant advantages over the prior art processes. For example, the cost of additional alkylborane is eliminated for each batch in which the distillate stream is recycled. Additionally, since alkylboranes are hazardous, they must be destroyed prior to being disposed. The present process minimizes this expensive and time-consuming procedure. Moreover, it is especially surprising that very good selectivity in the reductions is obtained using recovered alkylboranes.<br>
Finally, we have also surprisingly and unexpectedly found that a combination of a trialkylborane and a dialkylalkoxyborane is synergistic in selectively reducing a beta-hydroxy ketone to obtain a cis-l,3-diol.<br>

The process of the present invention in its first aspect is an improved, economical, and commercially feasible method for preparing a compound of Formula I. The process of the present invention in its first aspect is outlined in Scheme 1.<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
Thus, a compound of Formula II wherein R is alky], NC-CH2-, PG-O-CH'2- wherein PG is a protecting group,<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R3 is C6H5, (H3C)2-N- or (H3C)2CH- and R4 is hydrogen, H3C-O-CH2-,<br>

OH, CH3, or<br>
H5C6-NHCO-0-, and R.9 is hydrogen or CH3, (Formula Removed)<br>
R1 is alkyl, or<br>
-CH2-CO2R6 wherein R6 is  alkyl; or a compound of Formula III wherein R and R1 are as defined above is treated with about 0.1 to about 2.0 molecular equivalents of a trialkylborane such as, for example, triethylborane, tripropylborane, tri n-butylborane, tri sec-butylborane and the like or a dialkylalkoxyborane such as, for example, dimethylmethoxyborane, dimethylethoxyborane, dimethylisopropoxyborane,<br>
diethylmethoxyborane, diethylethoxyborane, diethylisopropoxyborane, diisopropylmethoxyborane, diisopropylethoxyborane,<br>
diisopropylisopropoxyborane, and the like or a mixture of a trialkylborane and a dialkylalkoxyborane as described previously, followed by the stereoselective reduction with about 1 molecular equivalent of an alkali metal hydride such as, for example, sodium borohydride, zinc borohydride, lithium borohydride, lithium aluminum hydride, and the like; in a solvent such as a hydrocarbon, for example hexane, toluene, cyclohexane and the like; an alkanol, for example methanol, ethanol, isopropanol and the like; or an ether, for example diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, 1,2-dimethoxyethane, triglyme (triethylene glycol dimethyl ether) and the like, or mixtures thereof at a temperature of about -110°C to about -50°C to afford after concentration by distillation a compound of Formula I. Additional compound of Forraula II or III is subsequently treated with the distillate obtained by vacuum distillation from the first run followed by stereoselective reduction carried out as described above to afford a second batch of a compound of Formula I. Thus, recovered quantities of the alkylborane species can be used to convert additional quantities of a compound of Formula II or III to a compound of Formula I. This procedure using recovered alkylborane species can be repeated as desired to obtain additional quantities of a compound of Formula I.<br>
Preferably, the reaction is carried out with about 1.2 to 0.8 molecular equivalents of triethylborane or diethylmethoxyborane or a mixture of a trialkylborane and a dialkylalkoxyborane as described previously in a solvent, preferably a mixture of tetrahydrofuran and methanol, at a ratio of about 8 volumes of tetrahydrofuran to one volume of methanol. This is followed by the addition of about one molecular equivalent of sodium borohydride at about -110°C to about -50°C, preferably at -80°C, followed by stirring for about 30 minutes to about 3 hours. Under these preferred conditions, greater than 90% of a compound of Formula I is produced in the desired stereochemical conformation.<br>
Preferably, the present process is used to prepare [R-(R1,R1)]-1,1-dimethylethyl 6-cyano-3,5-dihydroxyhexanoate which is used as an intermediate<br>
to prepare atorvastatin. Compounds of Formula II or III are either known or capable of being prepared by methods known in the art.<br>
The process of the present invention in its second aspect is an improved, economical, and commercially feasible method for preparing a compound of Formula I as previously outlined in Scheme 1.<br>
In this aspect of the invention, applicants have found that a combination of a trialkylborane and a dialkylalkoxyborane surprisingly and unexpectedly is synergistic in selectively affording the desired cis-l,3-diol over the undesired trans-1,3-diol compared to the use of either a trialkylborane or a dialkylalkoxyborane alone. The synergistic combination comprises about 1% to 99% by weight of a trialkylborane and about 99% to 1% by weight of a dialkylalkoxyborane; preferably, a combination of about 90% by weight of a trialkylborane and 10% by weight of a dialkylalkoxyborane. This synergistic combination is of particular advantage since it does not require a stir time of the alkylborane species with the hydroxyketone at ambient temperature before reduction. The conditions and solvents for carrying out the reaction with a synergistic combination of a trialkylborane and a dialkylborane are as previously described above.<br>
Thus, for example, in the preparation of [R-(R*,R*)]l,l-dimethylethyl 6-cyanoi3,5-dihydroxyhexanoate when no pre-stir is used, triethylborane affords a 5 to 10:1 (cis:trans) mixture. When diethylmethoxyborane is used in place of triethylborane, a 5 to 10:1 (cis:trans) mixture is obtained. When a combination of 10% by weight of diethylmethoxyborane and 90% by weight of triethylborane is used, typically a greater than 30:1 (cis:trans) mixture is obtained. This synergistic effect of combining a dialkylalkoxyborane and a trialkylborane could not have been predicted based on the use of either reagent alone or literature precedent.<br>
The following examples are illustrative to show the present processes and to show the usefulness in the preparation of (4R-Cis) l,l-dimethylethyl-6-cyanomethyl-2,2-dimethyl-l,3-dioxane-4-acetate which is an intermediate prepared from a 1,3-diol of the present process that can be converted to atorvastatin ([R-(R*,R*)]-2-(4-fluorophenyl)-ß,-dihydroxy-5-( 1 -methylethyl)-3-phenyl-4-[(phenylamino)carbonyl]-lH-pyrrole-l-heptanoic acid, calcium salt<br>
 (2:1)) (crystalline Form I) which is useful as a hypolipidemic and hypocholesterolemic agent.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
(4R-Cis) 1.1 -Dimethylethyl-6-cvanomethyl-2,2-Dimethyl-1,3-dioxane-4-acetate<br>
Step (1):	Preparation of 5R 1.1-Dimethylethyl 6-cvano-5-hvdroxv-3-<br>
oxohexanoate<br>
To a vessel containing 265 kg of 16.8% n-butyllithium is added a mixture<br>
of 80 kg of diisopropylamine in 80 L of tetrahydrofuran maintaining the<br>
temperature at less than 20°C. The solution is cooled to -55°C, and 85 kg of tert-<br>
butyl acetate is added maintaining the temperature at -50° ± 5°C. A solution of<br>
25 kg of R 4-cyano-3-hydroxybutanoic acid ethyl ester in 55 L of tetrahydrofuran<br>
is then added, and the temperature is allowed to warm to -20°C for at least<br>
20 minutes. The solution is then quenched by transferring to aqueous hydrochloric<br>
acid. The organic layer is separated and the aqueous layer re-extracted with ethyl<br>
acetate. The combined organic layers are concentrated by vacuum distillation to<br>
afford crude 5R 1,1-dimethylethyl 6-cyano-5-hydroxy-3-oxohexanoate.<br>
Step (2):	Preparation of rR-(R*,R*)l-1,1-Dimethylethyl 6-cvano-3,5-<br>
dihvdroxvhexanoate Method A: Using Triethylborane Step (a):<br>
Crude 5R 1,1-dimethylethyl 6-cyano-5-hydroxy-3-oxohexanoate (about 150 moles) from Step (1) is dissolved in 325 L of tetrahydrofuran containing about 20 kg of triethylborane, stirred for about 2 hours at room temperature, cooled to -75°C ± 20°C and diluted with 25 L of methanol and 8 kg of acetic acid. Sodium borohydride (8 kg) as a solution in methanol and aqueous sodium hydroxide is added slowly. After the addition, the reaction mixture is warmed to 0°C ± 25°C. The reaction mixture is optionally quenched by the addition of 3 kg of acetic acid and 10 L of methanol and concentrated by vacuum distillation, saving the distillate. The residue is dissolved in methanol and acetic acid, optionally diluted with water, and concentrated by vacuum distillation, keeping this distillate separate from the first one. The residue is dissolved in methanol and<br>
concentrated by vacuum distillation. The residue is dissolved in a mixture of water and ethyl acetate, and the aqueous layer separated. The organic layer is concentrated by vacuum distillation. The residue is dissolved in methanol and acetic acid and concentrated by vacuum distillation. The residue is dissolved in ethyl acetate and concentrated by vacuum distillation affording crude [R-(R*,R*)]-l,l-dimethylethyl 6-cyano-3,5-dihydroxyhexanoate.<br>
The cis:trans ratio was about 30:1 as measured after conversion to (4R cis<br>
and trans) 1,1 -dimethylethyl 6-cyanomethyl-2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxane-4-acetate<br>
according to the procedure described herein in Step 3.<br>
Step (b):	Reusing recovered triethylborane<br>
Crude 5R 1,1-dimethylethyl 6-cyano-5-hydroxy-3-oxohexanoate (about 150 moles) from Step (1) is dissolved in the first distillate from Step (a) along with 50 L of tetrahydrofuran, cooled to -75°C ± 20°C, and optionally diluted with 25 L of methanol, and 10 kg of acetic acid. Sodium borohydride (8 kg) as a solution in methanol and aqueous sodium hydroxide is added slowly. After the addition, the reaction mixture is warmed to 0°C ± 25°C. The reaction mixture is quenched by the addition of 10 kg of acetic acid and 20 L of methanol and concentrated by vacuum distillation. The residue is dissolved in methanol and acetic acid, optionally diluted with water, and concentrated by vacuum distillation. The residue is dissolved in methanol and concentrated by vacuum distillation. The residue is dissolved in a mixture of water and ethyl acetate, and the aqueous layer separated.
