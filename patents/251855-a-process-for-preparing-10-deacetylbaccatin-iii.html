				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to the semi-synthesis of taxane<br>
intermediates useful in the preparation of paclitaxel and docetaxel, in particular, the<br>
semi-synthesis and isolation of 10-deacetylbaccatin III, the semi-synthesis of a mixture<br>
of 10-deacetylbaccatin III and baccatin III, and derivatives thereof, from a mixture of<br>
taxanes.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
The taxane family of terpenes has received much attention in the<br>
scientific and medical community because members of this family have demonstrated<br>
broad spectrum anti-leukemic and tumor-inhibitory activity. A well-known member of<br>
this family is paclitaxel (1, Taxol).		<br><br>
Paclitaxel was first isolated from the bark of the pacific yew tree {Taxus<br>
brevifolia) in 1971, and has proved to be a potent natural anticancer agent. For<br>
example, paclitaxel has been found to have activity against different forms of leukemia<br>
and against solid tumors in the breast, ovary, brain, and lung in humans.<br>
This activity has stimulated an intense research effort over recent years,<br>
including the search for other taxanes having similar or improved properties, and the<br>
development of synthetic pathways for making taxanes such as paclitaxel. One result<br>
from this research effort was the discovery of a synthetic analog of paclitaxel, docetaxel<br>
(2, more commonly known as taxotere). As disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,814,470,<br>
taxotere has been found to have very good anti-tumor activity and better bio-availability<br><br>
than paclitaxel. Taxotere is similar in structure to paclitaxel, having t-butoxycarbonyl<br>
instead of benzoyl on the amino group at the 3' position, and a hydroxyl group instead<br>
of the acetoxy group at the C-10 position.<br><br>
Taxanes are structurally complicated molecules, and the development of<br>
commercially viable synthetic methods to make taxanes has been a challenge. A<br>
number of semi-synthetic pathways have been developed, which typically begin with<br>
the isolation and purification of a naturally occurring material and then its conversion to<br>
the taxane of interest. For example, paclitaxel and taxotere may be prepared semi-<br>
synthetically from 10-deacetylbaccatin III or baccatin III as set forth in U.S. Patent No.<br>
4,924,011 to Denis et al. and U.S. Patent No. 4,924,012 to Colin et al. or by the reaction<br>
of a p-lactam and a suitably protected 10-deacetylbaccatin III or baccatin III derivative<br>
as set forth in U.S. Patent No. 5,175,315 to Holton et al. or U.S. Patent Application No.<br>
10/683,865, which application is assigned to the assignee of the present invention. 10-<br>
deacetylbaccatin III (10-DAB, 3) and baccatin III (BACC III, 4) can be separated from<br>
mixtures extracted from natural sources such as the needles, stems, bark or heartwood<br>
of numerous Taxus species and have the following structures.<br><br>
Although, much of the research towards the semi-synthesis of paclitaxel<br>
and taxotere has involved 10-deacetylbaccatin III as the starting material, other taxanes<br>
from the Taxus species, such as 9-dihydro-13-acetylbaccatin III (9-DHB, 5), present in<br>
the Canadian yew (Taxus Canadensis), cephalomannine (6), 10-deacetyl taxol (10-<br><br>
DAT, 7), 7-xylosyl taxol (8), 10-deacetyl-7-xylosyl taxol (9), and a number of 7-epi-<br>
taxanes have been collected and identified.<br><br><br>
As disclosed in U.S. Patent Application No. 10/695,416, which<br>
application is assigned to the assignee of the present invention, U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
6,576,777 and 6,222,053 to Zamir et al. and U.S. Patent Nos. 6,175,023 and 6,179,981<br>
to Liu et al., docetaxel and paclitaxel (and suitable starting materials for the synthesis<br>
thereof) may also be prepared semi-synthetically from 9-dihydro-13-acetylbaccatin III.<br>
In addition, U.S. Patent Nos. 5,202,448 and 5,256,801 to Carver et al.,<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,449,790 to Zheng et al. and U.S. Patent No. 6,281,368 to McChesney<br>
et al. disclose processes for converting certain taxanes (namely, paclitaxel,<br>
cephalomannine, 10-deacetyl taxol and certain 10-deacetyl taxol derivatives) present in<br>
partially purified taxane mixtures into 10-deacetylbaccatin III and baccatin III, which<br>
may subsequently be utilized in the foregoing semi-synthetic pathways.<br>
Although there have been many advances in the field, there remains a<br>
need for new and improved processes for the preparation of taxane intermediates and<br>
their conversion to paclitaxel and docetaxel, in particular, for the preparation of such<br>
taxane intermediates from crude and partially purified mixtures comprising a plurality<br>
of taxanes. The present invention addresses these needs and provides further related<br>
advantages.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to one aspect of the present invention, the present invention<br>
relates to the semi-synthesis and isolation of taxane intermediates useful in the<br>
preparation of paclitaxel and docetaxel, in particular, the semi-synthesis and isolation of<br>

These processes may thus be utilized to convert a plurality of taxanes present in a crude<br>
taxane extract or in a waste taxane solution into taxanes, and taxane derivatives, that<br>
can be used to further synthesize paclitaxel and docetaxel. Representative waste taxane<br>
solutions may comprise (1) pooled waste stream fractions collected following the<br>
chromatographic separation and collection of paclitaxel enriched fractions from a crude<br>
or partially purified taxane extract, and/or (2) pooled waste mother liquors collected<br>

II. Process for Preparing and isolating 10-DAB from a Mixture of Taxanes<br>
As noted above, one aspect of the present invention relates to the semi-<br>
synthesis of taxane intermediates useful in the preparation of paclitaxel and docetaxel,<br>
in particular, the semi-synthesis of 10-deacetylbaccatin III, and protected derivatives<br>
thereof, from an initial mixture of taxanes.<br>
The taxanes present in the initial mixture, namely, 9-dihydro-13-<br>
acetylbaccatin III, paclitaxel, 10-deacetylbaccatin III, baccatin III, cephalomannine, 10-<br><br>
deacetyl taxol, 7-xylosyl taxol and 10-deacetyl-7-xylosyl taxol, can be represented by<br>
the following baccatin molecular framework:<br><br>
wherein, R1 is -OH, -OAc, N-(2-methyl-2-butenoyl)-(2R, 3S)-3-phenylisoserine or N-<br>
benzoyl-(2R, 3S)-3-phenylisoserine, R2 is -OH or -OAc, R3 is -OH or =O, and R4 is<br>
- OH or xylosyl. For example, when R1 is -OAc, R2 is -OAc, R3 is -OH and R4 is -<br>
OH, the foregoing structure represents 9-dihydro-13-acetylbaccatin III, and when R1 is<br>
-OH, R2 is -OAc, R3 is =O and R4 is -OH, the foregoing structure represents baccatin<br>
III.<br>
As described in more detail below, 10-deacetylbaccatin III may be<br>
prepared from such an initial mixture of taxanes through steps of cleavage, protection,<br>
oxidation and deprotection of certain R1, R2, R3 and R4 substituents of the taxanes<br>
present in the initial mixture and the chromatographic separation of various taxanes<br>
present in the mixture following certain of such steps. For example, in a first<br>
embodiment, the present invention provides a process for preparing 10-deacetylbaccatin<br>
III from an initial mixture of taxanes, wherein the initial mixture comprises 9-dihydro-<br>
13-acetylbaccatin III, and at least one additional taxane selected from paclitaxel, 10-<br>
deacetylbaccatin III, baccatin III, cephalomannine, 10-deacetyl taxol, 7-xylosyl taxol<br>
and 10-deacetyl-7-xylosyl taxol, the process comprising the steps of:<br>
(1)	cleaving the ester linkages at the C-10 and C-13 positions<br>
of each taxane in the initial mixture having an ester linkage at one or both of the C-10<br>
and C-13 positions to yield a first intermediate mixture of C-10 and C-13 deprotected<br>
taxanes;<br>
(2)	separating the taxanes in the first intermediate mixture<br>
having a keto substituent at the C-9 position from the taxanes in the first intermediate<br>
mixture having a hydroxy group at the C-9 position to yield 10-deacetylbaccatin III and<br>
a second intermediate mixture of C-9 hydroxy taxanes;<br>
(3)	protecting the hydroxy groups at the C-7 and C-10 positions<br>
of each taxane in the second intermediate mixture to yield a third intermediate mixture<br>
of C-7 and C-10 protected taxanes;<br><br>
(4)	oxidizing the hydroxy group at the C-9 position of each<br>
taxane in the third intermediate mixture to yield a fourth intermediate mixture of C-9<br>
oxidized taxanes; and<br>
(5)	deprotecting the hydroxy groups at the C-7 and C-10<br>
positions of each taxane in the fourth intermediate mixture to yield 10-<br>
deacetylbaccatin III.<br>
In a second embodiment, the order of steps (2) and (3) are reversed, and<br>
the present invention provides a process for preparing 10-deacetylbaccatin III from an<br>
initial mixture of taxanes, wherein the initial mixture comprises 9-dihydro-13-<br>
acetylbaccatin III, and at least one additional taxane selected from paclitaxel, 10-<br>
deacetylbaccatin III, baccatin III, cephalomannine, 10-deacetyl taxol, 7-xylosyl taxol<br>
and 10-deacetyl-7-xylosyl taxol, the process comprising the steps of:<br>
(1)	cleaving the ester linkages at the C-10 and C-13 positions of<br>
each taxane in the initial mixture having an ester linkage at one or both of the C-10 and<br>
C-13 positions to yield a first intermediate mixture of C-10 and C-13 deprotected<br>
taxanes;<br>
(2)	protecting the hydroxy groups at the C-7 and C-10 positions<br>
of each taxane in the first intermediate mixture having a hydroxy group at one or both<br>
of the C-7 and C-10 positions to yield a second intermediate mixture of C-7 and C-10<br>
protected taxanes;<br>
(3)	separating the taxanes in the second intermediate mixture<br>
having a keto substituent at the C-9 position from the taxanes in the second intermediate<br>
mixture having a hydroxy group at the C-9 position to yield C-7 and C-10 protected 10-<br>
deacetylbaccatin III and a third intermediate mixture of C-9 hydroxy taxanes;<br>
(4)	oxidizing the hydroxy group at the C-9 position of each<br>
taxane in the third intermediate mixture to yield a fourth intermediate mixture of C-9<br>
oxidized taxanes; and<br>
(5)	deprotecting the hydroxy groups at the C-7 and C-10<br>
positions of each taxane in the fourth intermediate mixture to yield 10-<br>
deacetylbaccatin in.<br>
In general, such cleavage, protection, separation, oxidation and<br>
deprotection steps comprise the following methods.<br><br>
General Method of Cleavage<br>
In one embodiment, the ester linkages at the C-10 and C-13 positions of<br>
a taxane in the initial mixture can be cleaved using a base. Suitable bases include, but<br>
are not limited to, sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, potassium tert-butoxide,<br>
lithium tert-butoxide, LiHMDS, n-butyl lithium, lithium hydroxide, methyl lithium, or a<br>
mixture of n-BuLi/K-t-OBu. Typically, K-t-OBu, Li-t-OBu, LiHMDS, n-BuLi, LiOH<br>
or CH3Li can be used. More typically, the step of cleaving the ester linkages at the C-<br>
10 and C-13 positions of each taxane in the initial mixture comprises contacting the<br>
initial mixture with K-t-OBu.<br>
In another embodiment, the ester linkages at the C-10 and C-13 positions<br>
of a taxane in the initial mixture can be cleaved using a reducing salt. The term<br>
"reducing salt" refers to a reducing agent in the presence of a Lewis acid. Suitable<br>
reducing agents include, but are not limited to, tetrabutylammonium borohydride,<br>
lithium borohydride, sodium triacetoxy borohydride, sodium hydride and sodium<br>
borohydride. Suitable Lewis acids include, but are not limited to, SbCl5, ZnCl2, CuCl2,<br>
PbCl2, GeCl2, SnBr2, Snl2 and CoBr2.<br>
For example, in one embodiment, a mixture of taxanes having ester<br>
linkages at one or both of the C-10 and C-13 positions are dissolved in an organic<br>
solvent, such as DCM (dichloromethane), THF (tetrahydrofuran), DMF (dimethyl<br>
formamide) or DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide), and cooled to a low temperature under<br>
argon atmosphere. To this solution is added a suitable base, and the reaction is stirred<br>
until complete consumption of the starting material as evidenced by TLC. The reaction<br>
is then worked up as usual and, after purification of the crude mixture by column<br>
chromatography using mixtures of DCM/ethyl acetate, the pure C-10 and C-13<br>
deprotected product was obtained.<br>
In another embodiment, the mixture of taxanes having ester linkages at<br>
one or both of the C-10 and C-13 positions are dissolved in an organic solvent and a<br>
minimum volume of water is added. To this mixture, a suitable reducing agent is added<br>
in small portions with vigorous stirring and a catalytic amount of a Lewis acid is added.<br>
After completion of the addition, the reaction mixture is stirred for an additional 15<br>
min, then NH4Cl is added as a concentrated aqueous solution, the layers are then<br>
separated and the aqueous phase is extracted with DCM. The combined organic extract<br>
is dried and evaporated to give the crude C-10 and C-13 deprotected product.<br>
Purification by dry-flash chromatography using DCM/MeOH affords the purified C-10<br>
and C-13 deprotected product.<br><br>
General Method of Protection<br>
Generally stated, the hydroxy groups at the C-7 and C-10 positions of a<br>
taxane can be selectively protected by contacting the intermediate mixture with a base<br>
and a hydroxy-protecting group in an organic solvent. The intermediate mixture can be<br>
the immediate reaction mixture resulted from an initial cleavage of the ester groups at<br>
the C-10 and C-13 position and comprises taxanes having C-9 keto and C-9 hydroxy<br>
groups. Alternatively, the intermediate mixture comprises only those taxanes having C-<br>
9 hydroxy groups after a separation step.<br>
The hydroxy groups at the C-7 and C-10 positions of a taxane can be<br>
selectively protected using any of a variety of hydroxy protecting groups, such as<br>
alkylating agents, acylating agents and silylating agent. For example, the C-7 and C-10<br>
hydroxy groups may be silylated using any of a variety of common silylating agents<br>
including, but not limited to, tri(hydrocarbonyl)silyl halides and tri(hydrocarbonyl)silyl<br>
trifiates. The hydrocarbonyl moieties of these compounds may be substituted or<br>
unsubstituted and preferably are substituted or unsubstituted alkyl or acyl. More<br>
specifically, the C-7 and C-10 hydroxy groups can be selectively silylated, for example,<br>
using silylating agents such as tribenzylsilyl chloride, trimethylsilyl chloride,<br>
triethylsilyl chloride, dimethylisopropylsilyl chloride, dimethylphenylsilyl chloride and<br>
the like. Alternatively, selective acylation of the C-7 and C-10 hydroxy groups can be<br>
achieved using any of a variety of common acylating agents, including, but not limited<br>
to substituted and unsubstituted carboxylic acid derivatives, e.g., carboxylic acid<br>
halides, anhydrides, dicarbonates, isocyanates and haloformates. Typically, the C-7<br>
and C-10 hydroxy groups can be selectively acylated, for example, with di-tert-butyl<br>
dicarbonate, dibenzyl dicarbonate, diallyl dicarbonate, 2,2,2-trichloroethyl<br>
chloroformate, benzyl chloroformate or dichloroacetyl chloride or another common<br>
acylating agent. More typically, tert-butoxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, 2,2,2-<br>
trichloroethoxycarbonyl, dichloroacetyl and acetyl are used.<br>
In the present invention, these protecting reactions are carried out in the<br>
presence of a base, such as, for example, Li-t-OBu, K-t-OBu, n-BuLi, a mixture of n-<br>
BuLi/K-t-OBu, LiOH, pyridine, DMAP or TEA. In a specific embodiment, the base is<br>
DMAP and the hydroxy-protecting group is tert-butoxycarbonyl.<br>
Exemplary reaction conditions are as follows: a mixture of taxanes is<br>
dissolved in an organic solvent, such as anhydrous DCM (dichloromethane) or THF<br>
(tetrahydrofuran) or DMF (dimethyl formamide) or DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) under<br>
an argon atmosphere at low temperature. To this solution is added DMAP<br>
(dimethylaminopyridine) or any other base, such as Li-t-OBu or K-t-OBu, followed by<br><br>
an acylating agent, such as di-tert-butyl dicarbonate, or an alkylating agent, such as<br>
triethyl silyl chloride or any other chloride containing a hydroxy-protecting group. The<br>
mixture is left at low to room temperature until complete consumption of the starting<br>
material, as visualized by TI.C. The mixture is then quenched with cold water and<br>
extracted thrice with DCM. The organic layer is washed with water and then with brine<br>
to remove unwanted salts. The organic layer may then be dried and evaporated under<br>
vacuum, and the residue recrystallized or column chromatographed with DCM/EtOAc<br>
mixtures to afford C-7 and C-10 protected taxanes.<br>
General Method of Separation<br>
Normal phase silica chromatography may be utilized to separate a<br>
mixture of taxanes into the following two groups: taxanes having a keto substituent at<br>
the C-9 position (i.e., protected 10-DAB derivatives) and taxanes having a hydroxy<br>
group at the C-9 position. As used herein, silica chromatography generally refers to the<br>
process of contacting a sample dissolved in a feed solvent with a silica matrix then<br>
eluting the silica matrix with an eluting solvent to obtain a fraction enriched with a<br>
desired component.<br>
The dimensions of the silica column are selected according to the<br>
quantity and purity of the solids to be separated. In one embodiment of a pilot scale<br>
process, about 250 grams of solids are dissolved in about 0.75 liters of feed solvent<br>
which is then chromatographed over a Silica column of about 1.5-inches x 10-feet. In<br>
another embodiment, about 40-50 kg of solids are dissolved in about 100-200 liters of<br>
feed solvent, and chromatographed over a Silica column of about 18-inches x 10-feet.<br>
It has also been shown that a layer of about 1-15 cm of Celite, preferably<br>
about 2-8 cm, on top of the silica column is recommended as a column prefilter which<br>
substantially decreases the loading time of the sample. It has further been shown that<br>
the optimal eluting solvent for the Silica column can be a hexane/acetone or DCM/ethyl<br>
acetate or DCM/methanol mixtures.<br>
General Method of Oxidation<br>
Generally stated, the hydroxy group at the C-9 position of each taxane in<br>
an intermediate mixture can be selectively oxidized by contacting the intermediate<br>
mixture with an oxidizing agent selected from the group consisting of 4-<br>
(dimethylamino)pyridinium chlorochromate, pyridinium chlorochromate, chromium<br>
(IV) oxide-silica gel, chromium (IV) oxide-acetic acid, bromine, dimethyl sulfoxide-<br><br>
dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, and manganese dioxide with dichloro(p-cymene)-ruthenium<br>
(II). In specific embodiments, the oxidizing agent is chromium (IV) oxide-silica gel.<br>
For example, C-7 protected taxanes are dissolved in an organic solvent<br>
and treated with an oxidant at low to room temperature conditions. The reaction is<br>
stirred until all the starting material is consumed, as evidenced by TLC. The reaction is<br>
then worked up as usual to yield a mixture of C-9 oxidized taxanes. Such mixture can<br>
be further purified by column chromatography or crystallized from a suitable solvent.<br>
General Method of Deprotection<br>
Generally stated, the hydroxy groups at the C-7 and C-10 positions of<br>
each taxane in an intermediate mixture are separately deprotected.<br>
C-10 protected taxanes may be deprotected using a base. Suitable bases<br>
include sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, potassium tert-butoxide, lithium tert-<br>
butoxide, LiHMDS, n-butyl lithium, lithium hydroxide, methyl lithium or a mixture of<br>
n-BuLi/K-t-OBu. For example, C-10 protected taxanes are dissolved in an organic<br>
solvent and cooled to a low temperature under argon atmosphere. To this solution is<br>
added a suitable base, and the reaction is stirred until complete consumption of the<br>
starting material as evidenced by TLC. The reaction is then worked up as usual and,<br>
after purification of the crude mixture by column chromatography using mixtures of<br>
DCM/ethyl acetate, the pure C-10 deprotected product was obtained.<br>
C-7 protected taxanes may be deprotected using an acid. Suitable acids<br>
include HF, HCl, TFA and acetic acid. For example, C-7 protected taxanes are<br>
dissolved in pyridine or an organic solvent at room temperature and treated with an<br>
acid, such as HF, HCl, TFA or acetic acid. The reaction is stirred at this temperature<br>
until complete consumption of the starting materials, as evidenced by TLC. The<br>
reaction is worked up as usual to give the C-7 deprotected product, which could be<br>
further purified by column chromatography or crystallized from a suitable solvent.<br>
In a specific embodiment, the step of deprotecting the hydroxy groups at<br>
the C-7 and C-10 positions of each taxane in an intermediate mixture comprises: (1)<br>
deprotecting the hydroxy groups at the C-10 positions of each taxane in an intermediate<br>
mixture comprises contacting the intermediate mixture with a base selected from the<br>
group consisting of LiOH, n-BuLi, Li-t-OBu, CH3Li, K-t-OBu and LiHMDS, and (2)<br>
deprotecting the hydroxy groups at the C-7 position of each taxane in the fourth<br>
intermediate mixture comprises contacting the fourth intermediate mixture with an acid<br>
selected from the group consisting of HF, TFA, HC1 and acetic acid.<br><br>
III. Process for Preparing 10-DAB and BACC HI from a Mixture of Taxanes<br>
As noted above, another aspect of the present invention relates to the<br>
semi-synthesis of taxane intermediates useful in the preparation of paclitaxel and<br>
docetaxel, in particular, the semi-synthesis of 10-deacetylbaccatin III and baccatin III,<br>
and derivatives thereof, from an initial mixture of taxanes.<br>
The taxanes present in the initial mixture, namely, 9-dihydro-13-<br>
acetylbaccatin III, paclitaxel, 10-deacetylbaccatin III, baccatin III, cephalomannine, 10-<br>
deacetyl taxol, 7-xylosyl taxol and 10-deacetyl-7-xylosyl taxol, contain the following<br>
baccatin molecular framework:<br><br>
wherein R1 is -OH, -OAc, N-(2-methyl-2-butenoyl)-(2R, 3S)-3-phenylisoserine or N-<br>
benzoyl-(2R, 3S)-3-phenylisoserine, R2 is -OH or -OAc, R3 is -OH or =O, and R4 is -<br>
OH or xylosyl. For example, when R1 is -OAc, R2 is -OAc, R3 is -OH and R4 is -OH,<br>
the foregoing structure represents 9-dihydro-13-acetylbaccatin III, and when R1 is -OH,<br>
R2 is -OAc, R3 is =O and R4 is -OH, the foregoing structure represents baccatin III.<br>
As described in more detail below, 10-deacetylbaccatin III and baccatin<br>
III may be prepared from such an initial mixture of taxanes through the protection,<br>
cleavage, oxidation and deprotection of certain R1, R2, R3 and R4 substituents of the<br>
taxanes present in the initial mixture. For example, the present invention provides a<br>
process for preparing 10-deacetylbaccatin III and baccatin III from an initial mixture of<br>
taxanes, wherein the initial mixture comprises 9-dihydro-13-acetylbaccatin III or<br>
cephalomannine, and at least one additional taxane selected from paclitaxel, 10-<br>
deacetylbaccatin III, baccatin III, 9-dihydro-13-acetylbaccatin III, cephalomannine, 10-<br>
deacetyl taxol, 7-xylosyl taxol and 10-deacetyl-7-xylosyl taxol, the process comprising<br>
the steps of:<br>
(1) protecting the hydroxy group at the C-7 position of each<br>
taxane in the initial mixture having a hydroxy group at the C-7 position and cleaving<br>
the ester linkage at the C-13 position of each taxane in the initial mixture having an<br>
ester linkage at the C-13 position to yield a first intermediate mixture of C-7 protected<br>
taxanes;<br><br>
(2)	oxidizing the hydroxy group at the C-9 position of each<br>
taxane in the first intermediate mixture having a hydroxy group at the C-9 position to<br>
yield a second intermediate mixture of C-7 protected taxanes; and<br>
(3)	deprotecting the hydroxy group at the C-7 position of each<br>
taxane in the second intermediate mixture to yield 10-deacetylbaccatin III and baccatin<br>
The combined step of protection and cleavage can be carried out<br>
according to the following method:<br>
Combined Step of Protection and Cleavage<br>
The hydroxy group at the C-7 position of a taxane can be selectively<br>
protected using any of a variety of hydroxy protecting groups, such as acetal, ketal,<br>
silyl, and removable acyl protecting groups. For example, the C-7 hydroxy group may<br>
be silylated using any of a variety of common silylating agents including, but not<br>
limited to, tri(hydrocarbonyl)silyl halides and tri(hydrocarbonyl)silyl triflates. The<br>
hydrocarbonyl moieties of these compounds may be substituted or unsubstituted and<br>
preferably are substituted or unsubstituted alkyl or acyl. More specifically, the C-7<br>
hydroxy group can be selectively silylated, for example, using silylating agents such as<br>
tribenzylsilyl chloride, trimethylsilyl chloride, triethylsilyl chloride,<br>
dimethylisopropylsilyl chloride, dimethylphenylsilyl chloride and the like.<br>
Alternatively, selective acylation of the C-7 hydroxy group can be achieved using any<br>
of a variety of common acylating agents, but not limited to substituted and<br>
unsubstituted carboxylic acid derivatives, e.g., carboxylic acid halides, anhydrides,<br>
dicarbonates, isocyanates and haloformates. More specifically, the C-7 hydroxy group<br>
can be selectively acylated, for example, with di-tert-butyl dicarbonate, dibenzyl<br>
dicarbonate, diallyl dicarbonate, 2,2,2-trichloroethyl chloroformate, benzyl<br>
chloroformate or dichloroacetyl chloride or another common acylating agent.<br>
In the present invention, these protecting reactions are carried out in the<br>
presence of a base, such as, for example, Li-t-OBu, K-t-OBu, n-BuLi, a mixture of n-<br>
BuLi/K-t-OBu, LiOH, pyridine, DMAP or TEA. In addition to aiding in the protection<br>
of the C-7 hydroxy group, depending upon the amount of base utilized, the base also<br>
cleaves any ester linkage at the C-13 position and, may also cleave any ester linkage at<br>
the C-10 position.<br>
Exemplary reaction conditions are as follows: a mixture of taxanes is<br>
dissolved in anhydrous DCM (dichloromethane) or THF (tetrahydrofuran) or DMF<br>
(dimethyl formamide) or DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) under an argon atmosphere at<br>
low temperature. To this solution is added DMAP (dimethylaminopyridine) or any<br><br>
other lithium or potassium base, such as Li-t-OBu, K-t-OBu, n-BuLi, a mixture of n-<br>
BuLi/K-t-OBu, or LiOH, followed by an acylating agent, such as di-tert-butyl<br>
dicarbonate, or an alkylating agent, such as triethyl silyl chloride or any other chloride<br>
containing a hydroxy-protecting group. The mixture is left at low to room temperature<br>
until complete consumption of the starting material, as visualized by TLC. In addition,<br>
excess amounts of the base may be added to this mixture, in the same pot, to ensure<br>
cleavage of any ester linkages at the C-13 and/or C-10 positions. The mixture is then<br>
quenched with cold water and extracted thrice with DCM. The organic layer is washed<br>
with water and then with brine to remove unwanted salts. The organic layer may then<br>
be dried and evaporated under vacuum, and the residue recrystallized or column<br>
chromatographed with DCM/EtOAc mixtures to afford a mixture of C-7 protected<br>
taxanes.<br>
The step of oxidation can be carried out in a similar manner as described<br>
above.<br>
The step of deprotection can be carried out in the following method:<br>
General Method of Deprotection<br>
C-7 protected taxanes may be deprotected using an acid. Suitable acids<br>
include HF, HC1, TFA and acetic acid.<br>
For example, C-7 protected taxanes are dissolved in pyridine or an<br>
organic solvent at room temperature and treated with an acid, such as HF, HC1, TFA or<br>
acetic acid. The reaction is stirred at this temperature until complete consumption of<br>
the starting materials, as evidenced by TLC. The reaction is worked up as usual to give<br>
the deprotected product, which could be further purified by column chromatography or<br>
crystallized from a suitable solvent.<br>
IV. Initial Mixture of Taxanes<br>
As noted above, the processes of the present invention may be utilized<br>
for high yield and large scale conversion of taxanes present in a waste taxane solution<br>
into taxanes intermediates, namely, 10-deacetylbaccatin III and baccatin III protected<br>
derivatives thereof, that can be used to further synthesize paclitaxel and docetaxel.<br>
Such a waste taxane solution may comprise (1) pooled waste stream fractions collected<br>
following the chromatographic separation and collection of paclitaxel enriched fractions<br>
from a crude or partially purified taxane extract, and/or (2) pooled waste mother liquors<br>
collected following the recrystallization of a crude or partially purified taxane extract.<br><br>
Such waste taxane solutions may be obtained by a number of different<br>
methods, such as, for example, the methods disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,136,989 to<br>
Foo et al., and other references cited therein, which patent is incorporated herein by<br>
reference in its entirety. A representative method of obtaining a waste taxane solution,<br>
which comprises pooled waste stream fractions, comprises the following extraction and<br>
column chromatography steps.<br>
Starting Taxane-Containing Material<br>
A suitable taxane-containing material is any tissue that contains a high<br>
taxane content. Examples of suitable taxane-containing material include tissues from<br>
various species of Yew plants comprising the genus Taxus, most preferably the roots<br>
and needles of ornamental Yew plants such as T. canadensis, T. x media spp Hicksii, T.<br>
x dark green spreader and Hill., T. chinensis, T. wallichiana, T. cuspidata, T. globosa,<br>
T. sumatrana, T. marei and T. floridana, and the bark of T. brevifolia or T. yunnanensis.<br>
Other suitable material include cultures of plant tissues obtained from a Taxus species.<br>
In a typical practice, such as set forth in U.S. Patent No. 6,139,989, the<br>
taxane-containing material is either pulverized, chipped or otherwise ground into small<br>
pieces so as to increase efficiency of a solvent extraction. The taxane-containing<br>
material may also optionally be dried. Taxane-containing cell culture, cells,<br>
microorganisms and fermentation broths will typically be concentrated prior to solvent<br>
extraction. Cells and microorganisms can be processed as whole cells or cell paste or<br>
pulver.<br>
Extraction<br>
The taxane-containing material may be initially extracted by contacting<br>
the material with an organic solvent, usually for a prolonged period of at least 8 hours<br>
and typically for about 3 days with or without physical agitation to promote formation<br>
of a crude organic extract containing a plurality of taxanes. The extraction may employ<br>
any of the solvent systems that are known to be used for the extraction of paclitaxel,<br>
including but not limited to, acetone, methanol, ethanol, ethyl acetate, methylene<br>
chloride, chloroform, mixtures thereof, and mixtures containing an aqueous component<br>
of up to 60%. These solvents are typically added in an amount of about 4-20 liter per<br>
kg of the taxane-containing material to prepare the crude organic extract. Reference is<br>
made for example, to U.S. Patent No. 6,136,989 and the publications cited therein<br>
which provide a non-exclusive description of several solvent systems that may be used<br>
to prepare an organic extract containing a plurality of taxanes.<br><br>
In one embodiment, the organic solvent is a polar organic solvent,<br>
typically an alcohol. For some embodiments, methanol is preferred because of its low<br>
cost, ease of removal and efficiency of taxane extraction. In one embodiment, about 6-<br>
15 liters of methanol is added for every kg of taxane-containing material to be<br>
extracted. The extraction is accelerated by agitating the taxane-containing material, for<br>
example, by stirring or percolating the methanol with the taxane-containing material for<br>
about 1-5 days at a temperature between room temperature and about 60°C, most<br>
typically at about 40°C. When the taxane-containing material contains a paclitaxel<br>
content of at least 0.005%, methanol extraction for three days as described above<br>
recovers at least 90% of the available paclitaxel from the taxane-containing material, in<br>
addition to a plurality of other taxanes, to form a crude methanol extract containing<br>
about 0.1-0.5% paclitaxel and having an overall solid content of about 0.5-5% (w/v).<br>
The large volume of methanol extract thus obtained is optionally<br>
concentrated, typically about 10-30 fold by evaporation to obtain a methanol extract<br>
concentrate having a solid content of about 100-400 g/L.<br>
Liquid-Liquid Extraction<br>
The crude organic extract may be subsequently enriched for taxanes by<br>
performing 1-3 liquid-liquid extractions by mixing the organic extract with a non-<br>
miscible, organic solvent to form a two phase system wherein one phase contains the<br>
plurality of taxanes. Generally, the two phase system includes a polar phase.<br>
Optionally, the taxane-containing phase is selected and concentrated by evaporation to<br>
form a concentrated extract having a solid content of about 100-400 g/L and a paclitaxel<br>
purity of about 1-4%. In some embodiments, water is included to help remove<br>
preferentially water soluble materials and the less polar solvent is selected to remove<br>
undesirable compounds such as waxes, lipids, pigments, and sterols that are found in<br>
different amounts depending on the taxane-containing material used. Typical solvents<br>
for liquid-liquid partitioning include hexane, hexanes, and methylene chloride.<br>
Methylene chloride has generally been found to be suitable for liquid-liquid extraction<br>
of taxane-containing material especially when the solvent used for the crude organic<br>
extract is an alcohol.<br>
The concentrated extract obtained is optionally evaporated and the<br>
residue is re-dissolved in a solvent for loading onto a silica chromatography matrix.<br>
Other example methods of performing a liquid-liquid extraction are<br>
illustrated in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,475,120, 5,380,916, and 5,670,673 to Rao and<br>
references cited therein, and also in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,618,538 and 5,480,639 to<br><br>
ElSohly et al. and references cited therein. These methods or variants thereof may<br>
alternatively be used in lieu of the embodiments described. Furthermore, liquid-liquid<br>
extraction may be omitted altogether when a plant extract containing high taxane levels<br>
is obtained by other methods such as for example, by intervening precipitation,<br>
crystallization or chromatography steps. One example of such a method is found in<br>
PCT Publication Nos. WO 98/07712 by Zamir et al, which uses a precipitation step<br>
immediately after obtaining an initial organic extract to obtain a paclitaxel fraction that<br>
may be about 1% or higher.<br>
Silica Gel Column Chromatography<br>
As further set forth in U.S. Patent No. 6,136,989, the concentrated<br>
extract may be further purified by normal phase silica chromatography. As used herein,<br>
silica chromatography generally refers to the process of contacting a sample dissolved<br>
in a feed solvent with a silica matrix then eluting the silica matrix with an eluting<br>
solvent to obtain a fraction enriched with a desired component.<br>
The dimensions of the first silica column are selected according to the<br>
quantity and purity of the solids to be separated. In one embodiment of a pilot scale<br>
process, about 250 grams of solids are dissolved in about 0.75 liters of feed solvent<br>
which is then chromatographed over a Silica column of about 1.5-inches x 10-feet. In<br>
another embodiment, about 40-50 kg of solids are dissolved in about 100-200 liters of<br>
feed solvent, and chromatographed over a Silica column of about 18-inches x 10-feet.<br>
It has also been shown that a layer of about 1-15 cm of Celite, preferably<br>
about 2-8 cm, on top of the silica column is recommended as a column prefilter which<br>
substantially decreases the loading time of the sample. It has further been shown that<br>
the optimal eluting solvent for the Silica column should be a hexane/acetone mixture at<br>
a ratio of about 3:1 or a DCM/ethyl acetate mixture at a ratio of about 7:3. The "heart<br>
cut" fractions containing at least 2% paclitaxel are pooled and further purified, for<br>
example, according to the process set forth in U.S. Patent No. 6,136,989. The<br>
remaining waste stream fractions, which contain a plurality of taxanes, including,<br>
paclitaxel, 10-deacetylbaccatin III (10-DAB), baccatin III (BACC III), 9-dihydro-13-<br>
acetylbaccatin III (9-DHB), cephalomannine, 10-deacetyl taxol (10-DAT), 7-xylosyl<br>
taxol and 10-deacetyl-7-xylosyl taxol are pooled into a waste taxane solution for further<br>
processing according to the present invention.<br><br>
Further Purification Steps<br>
As set forth in more detail in U.S. Patent No. 6,139,989, the paclitaxel<br>
enriched "heart cut" fractions obtained from the foregoing chromatography step may be<br>
further purified through one or more additional chromatographic or recrystallization<br>
steps. Any waste stream fractions or waste mother liquors collected during such<br>
additional purification steps may also be pooled and added to the waste taxane solution<br>
for further processing according to the present invention.<br>
V. Process for Preparing Paclitaxel or Docetaxel<br>
As noted above, the 10-deacetylbaccatin III, and protected derivatives<br>
thereof, prepared from an initial mixture of taxanes according to the foregoing<br>
processes may be utilized to further synthesize paclitaxel and docetaxel. In this way, in<br>
a third embodiment, the present invention provides an overall process for preparing<br>
paclitaxel or docetaxel from an initial mixture of taxanes, wherein the initial mixture<br>
comprises 9-dihydro-13-acetylbaccatin III, and at least one additional taxane selected<br>
from paclitaxel, 10-deacetylbaccatin III, baccatin III, cephalomannine, 10-deacetyl<br>
taxol, 7-xylosyl taxol and 10-deacetyl-7-xylosyl taxol, the process comprising the steps<br>
of:<br>
(1)	cleaving the ester linkages at the C-10 and C-13 positions of<br>
each taxane in the initial mixture having an ester linkage at one or both of the C-10 and<br>
C-13 positions to yield a first intermediate mixture of C-10 and C-13 deprotected<br>
taxanes;<br>
(2)	separating the taxanes in the first intermediate mixture<br>
having a keto substituent at the C-9 position from the taxanes in the first intermediate<br>
mixture having a hydroxy group at the C-9 position to yield 10-deacetylbaccatin III and<br>
a second intermediate mixture of C-9 hydroxy taxanes;<br>
(3)	protecting the hydroxy groups at the C-7 and C-10 positions<br>
of each taxane in the second intermediate mixture to yield a third intermediate mixture<br>
of C-7 and C-10 protected taxanes;<br>
(4)	oxidizing the hydroxy group at the C-9 position of each<br>
taxane in the third intermediate mixture to yield a fourth intermediate mixture of C-9<br>
oxidized taxanes;<br>
(5)	deprotecting the hydroxy groups at the C-7 and C-10<br>
positions of each taxane in the fourth intermediate mixture to yield 10-deacetylbaccatin<br>
III; and<br><br>
(6) converting the 10-deacetylbaccatin III obtained from steps<br>
(2) and (5) to paclitaxel or docetaxel.<br>
In addition, in a fourth embodiment, the present invention provides a<br>
process for preparing paclitaxel or docetaxel from an initial mixture of taxanes, wherein<br>
the initial mixture comprises 9-dihydro-13-acetylbaccatin III, and at least one additional<br>
taxane selected from paclitaxel, 10-deacetylbaccatin III, baccatin III, cephalomannine,<br>
10-deacetyl taxol, 7-xylosyl taxol and 10-deacetyl-7-xylosyl taxol, the process<br>
comprising the steps of:<br>
(1)	cleaving the ester linkages at the C-10 and C-13 positions of<br>
each taxane in the initial mixture having an ester linkage at one or both of the C-10 and<br>
C-13 positions to yield a first intermediate mixture of C-10 and C-13 deprotected<br>
taxanes;<br>
(2)	protecting the hydroxy groups at the C-7 and C-10 positions<br>
of each taxane in the first intermediate mixture having a hydroxy group at one or both<br>
of the C-7 and C-10 positions to yield a second intermediate mixture of C-7 and C-10<br>
protected taxanes;<br>
(3)	separating the taxanes in the second intermediate mixture<br>
having a keto substituent at the C-9 position from the taxanes in the second intermediate<br>
mixture having a hydroxy group at the C-9 position to yield C-7 and C-10 protected 10-<br>
deacetylbaccatin III and a third intermediate mixture of C-9 hydroxy taxanes;<br>
(4)	oxidizing the hydroxy group at the C-9 position of each<br>
taxane in the third intermediate mixture to yield a fourth intermediate mixture of C-9<br>
oxidized taxanes;<br>
(5)	deprotecting the hydroxy groups at the C-7 and C-10<br>
positions of each taxane in the fourth intermediate mixture to yield 10-deacetylbaccatin<br>
III; and<br>
(6)	converting the C-7 and C-10 protected 10-deacetylbaccatin<br>
III obtained from step (3) and the 10-deacetylbaccatin III obtained from step (5) to<br>
paclitaxel or docetaxel.<br>
10-deacetylbaccatin III, and protected 10-deacetylbaccatin III, may be<br>
converted to paclitaxel and docetaxel by a number of different methods, such as, for<br>
example, the methods disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,924,011, 4,924,012, 5,175,315<br>
and 5,466,834, which patents are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety, and<br>
U.S. Patent Application No. 10/683,865, which application is assigned to the assignee<br>
of the present invention and is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br><br>
In a further embodiment, a mixture of 10-deacetylbaccatin III and<br>
baccatin III prepared from an initial mixture of taxanes according to the foregoing<br>
process can be converted to paclitaxel and docetaxel. To that end, the present invention<br>
provides an overall process for preparing paclitaxel or docetaxel from an initial mixture<br>
of taxanes, wherein the initial mixture comprises 9-dihydro-13-acetylbaccatin III or<br>
cephalomannine, and at least one additional taxane selected from paclitaxel, 10-<br>
deacetylbaccatin III, baccatin III, 9-dihydro-13-acetylbaccatin III, cephalomannine, 10-<br>
deacetyl taxol, 7-xylosyl taxol and 10-deacetyl-7-xylosyl taxol, the process comprising<br>
the steps of:<br>
(1)	protecting the hydroxy group at the C-7 position of each<br>
taxane in the initial mixture having a hydroxy group at the C-7 position and cleaving<br>
the ester linkage at the C-13 position of each taxane in the initial mixture having an<br>
ester linkage at the C-13 position to yield a first intermediate mixture of C-7 protected<br>
taxanes;<br>
(2)	oxidizing the hydroxy group at the C-9 position of each<br>
taxane in the first intermediate mixture having a hydroxy group at the C-9 position to<br>
yield a second intermediate mixture of C-7 protected taxanes;<br>
(3)	deprotecting the hydroxy group at the C-7 position of each<br>
taxane in the second intermediate mixture to yield 10-deacetylbaccatin III and baccatin<br>
III; and<br>
(4)	converting the 10-deacetylbaccatin IE and baccatin III to<br>
paclitaxel or docetaxel,<br>
wherein the step of converting the 10-deacetylbaccatin III and baccatin III to paclitaxel<br>
or docetaxel further comprises protecting the hydroxy group at the C-7 position of each<br>
of the 10-deacetylbaccatin III and baccatin III.<br>
10-deacetylbaccatin III and baccatin III may be converted to paclitaxel<br>
and docetaxel by a number of different methods, such as, for example, the methods<br>
disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,924,011, 4,924,012, 5,175,315 and 5,466,834, which<br>
patents are incorporated herein by. reference in their entirety, and U.S. Patent<br>
Application No. 10/683,865, which application is assigned to the assignee of the present<br>
invention and is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The following Examples disclose specific processes for synthesizing and<br>
isolating 10-deacetylbaccatin III, or a mixture of 10-deacetylbaccatin III and baccatin<br>
III, and protected derivatives thereof, from a solution containing a plurality of taxanes,<br><br>
and their subsequent conversion to paclitaxel and docetaxel. Unless otherwise noted,<br>
all scientific and technical terms have the meanings as understood by one of ordinary<br>
skill in the art.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Extraction of Taxanes from Taxus Canadensis<br>
Needles from the Canadian yew (Taxus Canadensis) were collected in<br>
Quebec. The dried needles (3 kg) were extracted by percolation with methanol at room<br>
temperature three times using 10L, 6L and 6L volumes of methanol in a glass container<br>
equipped with a filter at the bottom with a tap. The extraction with each subsequent<br>
volume of methanol was left for 24 hours and the mixture was filtered into an<br>
erlenmeyer flask by opening the tap at the bottom to give a crude extract. The crude<br>
methanolic extracts were combined and concentrated to give about 1.1L of a crude<br>
methanol extract concentrate.<br>
EXAMPLE 2A<br>
Filtration of the Crude Extract<br>
A silica/charcoal filter was prepared as follows. Norit SA3 charcoal (0.5<br>
kg: 100 mesh - Aldrich) was mixed with celite (0.5 kg: AC 2098T - Anachemia) and<br>
placed into a coarse scintered glass funnel. The charcoal-celite mixture was soaked<br>
with dichloromethane:methanol (9:1) and washed with an additional 1.0 L of the same<br>
solvent. The crude methanol extract concentrate was filtered on this bed of charcoal<br>
and then washed with 1.5 L of dichloromethane:methanol (9:1). The collected mixture<br>
was evaporated under vacuum using a rotovap and the residue was left under high<br>
vacuum for one hour using a vacuum pump to remove all traces of methanol.<br>
EXAMPLE 2B<br>
Liquid-Liquid Extraction<br>
The crude methanolic extract concentrate was partitioned with a mixture<br>
containing methanol (400 ml), water (800 ml) and hexane (1100 ml) in a 5L separatory<br>
funnel. After allowing for the solvents to partition, the top layer with dark green color<br>
was tested and discarded, the lower aqueous phase was extracted with methylene<br>
chloride two times. The methylene chloride extracts from two partitions were<br><br>
combined and then concentrated to generate 270 ml of DCM extract concentrate<br>
containing the plurality of taxanes.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
Silica Gel Column Chromatography<br>
318 g of silica gel (40-63 µm) was used to pack a lab 2-feet long column<br>
and 70 ml of the DCM extract concentrate (~21g solid) was loaded onto the column<br>
followed by DCM/EtOAc elution: 7L of DCM/EtOAc 7:3 and 3L of DCM/EtOAc 1:1.<br>
100 fractions were collected, each having a 100 ml volume. According to HPLC and<br>
TLC analyses, fractions were combined into five groups: paclitaxel containing<br>
fractions, cephalomannine and paclitaxel containing fractions, 9-DHB containing<br>
fractions, baccatin III containing fractions and 10-DAB containing fractions. The last<br>
four fractions (i.e., the waste stream fractions) can be combined into a pooled waste<br>
stream solution containing a plurality of taxanes, or can be used individually in further<br>
synthetic conversions. In the present case, after the paclitaxel containing fractions were<br>
eluted from the column, the remaining fractions were collected and pooled to form a<br>
waste taxane solution, which was further utilized in the following steps.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
SYNTHESIS AND ISOLATION OF 10-DEACETYLBACCATIN III<br>
FROM A WASTE TAXANE SOLUTION<br>
Cleavage of C-10 and C-13 Ester Linkages<br>
As noted above, any ester linkages at C-10 and C-13 positions of the<br>
taxanes in the waste taxane solution obtained from the above process can be cleaved by<br>
using reagents such as K-t-OBu, Li-t-OBu, LiHMDS, n-BuLi, LiOH and CH3Li, or<br>
NaBH4 and NaH in the presence of a Lewis acid, such as ZnCl2. For example, the<br>
waste taxane solution was dissolved in THF and cooled to -40 °C under argon<br>
atmosphere. To the stirred solution at this temperature was added any one of the above<br>
reagents, such as, for example, K-t-OBu and the reaction was monitored by TLC. The<br>
reaction was further stirred at this temperature for a period between 30 minutes to 6 hrs<br>
until complete consumption of the starting material as evidenced by TLC. Additional<br>
amounts of the base (e.g., K-t-OBu) were added at this temperature, and the reaction<br>
was stirred for an additional hour, as necessary for complete consumption of the starting<br>
material. The reaction mixture was then worked up as usual. Evaporation of the<br><br>
solvent afforded a crude first intermediate mixture of C-10 and C-13 deprotected<br>
taxanes that could be used directly in the next step of the synthesis or could be further<br>
purified by column chromatography using mixtures of DCM/ethyl acetate and/or<br>
crystallized from a suitable solvent.<br>
Protection of C-7 and C-10 Hydroxy Groups<br>
The first intermediate mixture of C-10 and C-13 deprotected taxanes was<br>
dissolved in THF and stirred at -40 °C under argon atmosphere. To this stirred solution<br>
at -40 °C was added a base (such as DMAP, pyridine, TEA or any other base, such as<br>
LiOH, Li-t-OBu, n-BuLi, K-t-OBu, or a mixture of n-BuLi/K-t-OBu) followed by<br>
addition of a hydroxy-protecting group agent (such as triethyl silyl chloride or any other<br>
alkylating agent, or acetic anhydride, acetyl chloride, di-tert-butyl dicarbonate or any<br>
other acylating agent). The reaction was stirred at this temperature for a period between<br>
30 minutes to 6 hrs until complete consumption of the initial starting material as<br>
evidenced by TLC and HPLC analysis. Additional amounts of the base and alkylating<br>
or acylating agent were added at this temperature, as necessary for complete<br>
consumption of the starting materials. The reaction mixture was then worked up as<br>
usual and the solvent removed to give a second intermediate mixture of C-7 and C-10<br>
protected taxanes that could be used directly in the next step of the synthesis or purified<br>
by either column chromatography using mixtures of DCM/EtOAc or crystallized from a<br>
suitable solvent.<br>
Chromatographic Separation<br>
318 g of silica gel (40-63 µm) was used to pack a lab 2-feet long column<br>
and the second intermediate mixture was loaded onto the column followed by<br>
DCM/EtOAc elution: 7L of DCM/EtOAc 7:3 and 3L of DCM/EtOAc 1:1. 100<br>
fractions were collected, each having a 100 ml volume. According to HPLC and TLC<br>
analyses, fractions were combined into two groups: fractions containing taxanes having<br>
a keto substituent at the C-9 position (i.e., protected 10-DAB derivatives) and taxanes<br>
having a hydroxy group at the C-9 position. The fractions containing taxanes having a<br>
hydroxy group at the C-9 position were pooled to yield a third intermediate mixture of<br>
C-9 hydroxy taxanes, which was further utilized in the following synthetic steps.<br>
Oxidation of C-9 Hydroxy Groups<br>
The third intermediate mixture of C-9 hydroxy taxanes was oxidized<br>
using an oxidizing agent to obtain a ketone at the C-9 position. This oxidation can be<br><br>
achieved using a variety of oxidants under mild conditions, including 4-<br>
(dimethylamino)pyridinium chlorochromate, pyridinium chlorochromate, chromium<br>
(IV) oxide-silica gel, chromium (IV) oxide-acetic acid (Fieser reagent) or acidic media,<br>
bromine, dimethyl sulfoxide-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, and manganese dioxide with<br>
dichloro(p-cymene)-ruthenium (II).<br>
The third intermediate mixture of C-9 hydroxy taxanes was dissolved in<br>
an organic solvent (such as acetone) and cooled to near 0 °C with continuous stirring.<br>
The oxidant was added to this solution at low temperature and the reaction was stirred<br>
for a period between 30 minutes to 6 hrs until complete consumption of the starting<br>
materials as evidenced by TLC. After completion of the reaction, the reaction was<br>
worked up as usual to afford a crude fourth intermediate mixture of C-9 oxidized<br>
taxanes that could be further purified (using silica gel column chromatography with<br>
mixtures of DCM/EtOAc for elution or crystallization from a suitable solvent) or used<br>
directly for the next step of the synthesis.<br>
Deprotection of C-7 and C-10 Hydroxy Groups<br>
As noted above, deprotection of the C-7 and C-10 hydroxy groups in the<br>
fourth intermediate mixture of C-9 oxidized taxanes can be accomplished by using<br>
reagents such as LiOH, n-BuLi, Li-t-OBu, CH3Li, K-t-OBu, and LiHMDS for the<br>
deprotection of the C-10 hydroxy groups, and HF, HC1, TFA and acetic acid for the<br>
deprotection of the C-7 hydroxy groups.<br>
The fourth intermediate mixture of C-9 oxidized taxanes was dissolved<br>
in THF and cooled to -40 °C under argon atmosphere. To the stirred solution at this<br>
temperature was added any one of the above bases, such as, for example, K-t-OBu and<br>
the reaction was monitored by TLC. The reaction was further stirred at this temperature<br>
for a period between 30 minutes to 6 hrs until complete consumption of the starting<br>
material as evidenced by TLC. The reaction mixture was then worked up as usual.<br>
Evaporation of the solvent afforded a crude mixture of C-10 deprotected taxanes that<br>
could be further deprotected at the C-7 position as described below, or could be further<br>
purified by column chromatography using mixtures of DCM/ethyl acetate and/or<br>
crystallized from a suitable solvent prior to deprotection at the C-7 position.<br>
The crude mixture of C-10 deprotected taxanes was dissolved in<br>
pyridine, DCM or an organic solvent at room temperature. To this solution was added<br>
HF or TFA. After complete consumption of the starting material as evidenced by TLC,<br>
the reaction was worked up and purified by flash chromatography using mixtures of<br><br>
DCM/EtOAc to afford 10-deacetylbaccatin III, which could further be crystallized from<br>

EXAMPLE 5<br>
SYNTHESIS OF PACLITAXEL AND DOCETAXEL FROM 10-DEACETYLBACCATIN III<br>
The 10-deacetylbaccatin III obtained from the prior steps is then<br>
converted to paclitaxel and/or docetaxel according to, for example, the process set forth<br>
in U.S. Patent No. 5,466,834, which application is incorporated herein by reference in<br>
its entirety.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
SYNTHESIS OF 10-DEACETYLBACCATIN III AND BACCATIN III<br>
FROM WASTE TAXANE SOLUTION<br>
Protection of C-7 Hydroxy Groups and Cleavage of C-13 Ester Linkages<br>
The waste taxane solution obtained from the above process was<br>
dissolved in THF and stirred at -40 °C under argon atmosphere. To this stirred solution<br>
at -40 °C was added a base (such as DMAP, pyridine, TEA or any other lithium or<br>
potassium base, such as LiOH, Li-t-OBu, n-BuLi, K-t-OBu or a mixture of n-BuLi/K-t-<br>
OBu) followed by addition of a hydroxy-protecting group agent (such as triethylsilyl<br>
chloride or any other alkylating agent, or acetic anhydride, acetyl chloride, di-tert-butyl<br>
dicarbonate or any other acylating agent). The reaction was stirred at this temperature<br>
for a period between 30 minutes to 6 hrs until complete consumption of the initial<br>
starting material as evidenced by TLC and HPLC analysis. Additional amounts of the<br>
base and alkylating or acylating agent were added at this temperature, as necessary for<br>
complete consumption of the starting materials and to ensure cleavage of the C-13 ester<br>
linkages. Further amounts of the base may be added to ensure cleavage of the C-10<br>
ester linkages. The reaction mixture was then worked up as usual and the solvent<br>
removed to give a crude first intermediate mixture of C-7 protected taxanes that could<br>
be used directly in the next step of the synthesis or purified by either column<br>
chromatography using mixtures of DCM/EtOAc or crystallized from a suitable solvent.<br>
Oxidation of C-9 Hydroxy Groups<br>
The first intermediate mixture of C-7 protected taxanes was oxidized<br>
using an oxidizing agent to obtain a ketone at the C-9 position. This oxidation for the<br><br>
first intermediate mixture of C-7 protected taxanes can be achieved using a variety of<br>
oxidants under mild conditions, including 4-(dimethylamino)pyridinium<br>
chlorochromate, pyridinium chlorochromate, chromium (IV) oxide-silica gel, chromium<br>
(IV) oxide-acetic acid (Fieser reagent) or acidic media, bromine, dimethyl sulfoxide-<br>
dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, and manganese dioxide with dichloro(p-cymene)-ruthenium<br>
(II).<br>
The first intermediate mixture of C-7 protected taxanes was dissolved in<br>
an organic solvent (such as acetone) and cooled to near 0°C with continuous stirring.<br>
The oxidant was added to this solution at low temperature and the reaction was stirred<br>
for a period between 30 minutes to 6 hrs until complete consumption of the starting<br>
materials as evidenced by TLC. After completion of the reaction, the reaction was<br>
worked up as usual to afford a crude second intermediate mixture of C-7 protected<br>
taxanes that could be further purified (using silica gel column chromatography with<br>
mixtures of DCM/EtOAc for elution or crystallization from a suitable solvent) or used<br>
directly for the next step of the synthesis.<br>
Deprotection of C-7 Hydroxy Groups<br>
As noted above, deprotection of the C-7 hydroxy groups in the second<br>
intermediate mixture of C-7 protected taxanes can be accomplished by using an acid,<br>
such as, HF, HC1, TFA or acetic acid.<br>
The second intermediate mixture of C-7 protected taxanes was dissolved<br>
in pyridine or an organic solvent at room temperature. To this solution was added HF,<br>
or any other acid such as HC1, TFA or acetic acid. After complete consumption of the<br>
starting material, as evidenced by TLC, the reaction was worked up as usual and<br>
purified by flash chromatography using mixtures of DCM/EtOAc to afford a mixture of<br>
10-deacetylbaccatin III and baccatin III, that could further be crystallized from a<br>
suitable solvent to give a product of &gt;99% purity.<br>
