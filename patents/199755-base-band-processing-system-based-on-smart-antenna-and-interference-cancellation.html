				<td>BASEBAND PROCESSING METHOD BASED ON SMART ANTENNA AND INTERFERENCE CANCELLATION<br>
Field of the Technology<br>
The present invention relates generally to a interference signal cancellation technology used in base station of wireless communication system with smart antenna, and more particularly to a baseband processing method based on smart antenna and interference cancellation.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
In modern wireless communication system, especially in CDMA wireless communication system, in order to raise system capacity, to raise system sensitivity and to have farther communication distance with lower emission power, smart antenna is used, in general.<br>
In the Chinese patent named "Time Division Duplex Synchronous Code Division Multiple Access Wireless Communication System with Smart Antenna" (CN 97 1 04039.7), a base station structure of wireless communication system with smart antenna is disclosed. It includes antenna array consisted of one or plural antenna units, corresponding radio frequency feeder cables and a set of coherent radio frequency transceivers. According to each antenna unit's different response to signal, coming from user terminals, baseband processor gets space characteristic vector and direction of arrival (DOA) of the signal; then with correspondence algorithm, receiving antenna beam forming is implemented. Among them, any antenna unit, corresponding feeder cable and coherent radio frequency transceiver together is called a link. By using weight, getting from up link receiving beam forming of each link, for down link transmitting beam forming, whole functionality of smart antenna can be implemented, under symmetrical wave propagation condition.<br>
The main part of modern wireless communication system is mobile communication. As mobile communication is working at a complex and variable environment (reference to ITU proposal M1225), severe influences of time-varying and multipath propagation have to be considered. In the patent said above and many disclosing technical documents concerning about beam forming algorithm of smart<br><br>
antenna, the conclusion is more functionality will be with more algorithm complexity. Nevertheless, under mobile communication environment, beam forming must be completed in real time, and algorithm-completed time is microsecond level. As limitation of modern microelectronic technology, digital signal processing (DSP) or application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) cannot implement too complex real time processing within such short time period. Facing with the conflict said above, under this mobile communication environment, simple and real time algorithm of smart antenna not only cannot solve the multipath propagation problem, but also cannot thoroughly solve system capacity problem of CDMA mobile communication system.<br>
On the other hand, in order to solve interference problem of multipath propagation, people deeply study technologies such as Rake receiver and Joint Detection or said Multi User Detection and use them in mobile communication system of Code Division Multiple Access widely. Nevertheless, the Rake receiver or multiuser detection technology, said above, cannot be directly used in mobile communication system with smart antenna. The main reasons are: multiuser detection technology processes CDMA signal of multiple code channels, after channel estimation and matched filter, all user data are once solved with inverse matrix, but for smart antenna technology, it makes beam forming for each code channel separately, it is difficult to use diversity advantage brought in by user multipath; Rake receiver technology composes user main multipath component, but it destroys phase relationship between antenna units of antenna array, also with limitation of Rake receiver principle, user number is same as spread spectrum coefficient, this makes it impossible to work at full code channel circumstances.<br>
There is a two-dimensional smart antenna technology, but it is in a research stage and its algorithm is immature and complex.<br>
There is another method which processes multiuser detection after using smart antenna; but at this time as each code channel has been separated, processing must be separated for each code channel; the result is that not only cannot fully bring multiuser detection function into play, but also greatly increase complexity of baseband signal processing.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br><br>
In order to have higher system capacity and better performance for CDMA Wireless communication system, it is necessary to search for a simple and real time interference cancellation method convenient for used in CDMA wireless communication based on smart antenna.<br>
Therefore, an object of the invention is to provide a baseband processing method based on smart antenna and interference cancellation. By designing a new digital signal processing method, CDMA mobile communication system or other wireless communication system, which use the method, can use smart antenna and solve multipath propagation interference at the same time.<br>
A further object of the invention is to provide a set of new digital signal processing methods, which can be used in CDMA mobile communication system or other wireless communication system, and can solve various multipath propagation interference while using smart antenna.<br>
The invention of a baseband processing method based on smart antenna and interference cancellation, comprising:<br>
A.	with known user training sequence, taking sampled-data output signal<br>
from each link antenna unit and radio frequency transceiver to make channel<br>
estimation, then getting all users response on all channel;<br>
B.	picking up useful symbolic level signal from the said sampled-data output<br>
signal, based on the said channel estimation and using beam forming of smart antenna;<br>
C.	reconstructing signal with the said useful symbolic level signal, adding<br>
scramble code, then getting chip level reconstructed signal;<br>
D.	subtracting the reconstructed signal from the said sampled-data output<br>
signal;<br>
E.	executing steps B to D repeatedly until recovery of all users signal.<br>
The said step A is done by channel estimation module, the said channel response includes matrix, which is related to each user training sequence and is calculated and stored beforehand.<br>
The said step B includes: making power estimation of response for all users on all channels with power estimation module, calculating all users main path and<br><br>
multipath power distribution in searching window; sending calculated power distribution to signal generator to generate signal, which includes: calculate each user maximum peak value power position, store peak value power position in power point and get de-spread result of all signal at the power point with smart antenna algorithm.<br>
When calculating the said each user maximum peak value power position, adjustment parameter of synchronization is sent to transmitting module of that user with most powerful path not at the same point of other users and without synchronized with base station.<br>
The said step B further comprises: sending de-spread result to signal/noise ratio estimation module simultaneously, estimating all users signal/noise ratio, executing steps C, D, E continuously for user with low signal/noise ratio and outputting signal result directly for user with high signal/noise ratio.<br>
The said estimating user signal/noise ratio comprises: calculating user power; deciding that power greater than certain field value as effective power; calculating square difference for all signals with effective power at their corresponding constellation map point; deciding those users with low signal/noise ratio if their square difference greater than preset value, and those users with high signal/noise ratio if their square difference less than preset value.<br>
The said step C reconstructs original signal in signal reconstructing module and calculates components of all users signal and multipath on each antenna unit.<br>
The said step D cancels interference in interference cancellation module.<br>
The said step E is executed in decision module, until number of interference cancellation loops reaching a preset number, less or equal to length of searching window, then stopping interference cancellation and outputting recovered signal.<br>
The said step E is executed in decision module, until signal/noise ratio of all signals greater than a set field value, then stopping interference cancellation and outputting recovered signal.<br>
The said step E executes steps B to D repeatedly with an at most repeated number equal to length of searching window.<br><br>
It is essential of the invention that beam forming of every multipath within searching window length is made for every channel, useful signals are picked and accumulated; so advantages of space diversity and time diversity are mostly utilized; in this way even in a severe multipath interference and white noise interference condition, better result can also be got. Calculation volume of the method is limited and can be implemented with commercial chips such as digital signal processor (DSP) or field programmable gate array (FPGA).<br>
The method of present invention mainly points to wireless communication system of code division multiple access including time division duplex (TDD) and frequency division duplex (FDD).<br>

Embodiments of the invention<br>
With embodiment and drawings, the invention is described in detail in the following.<br>
Referencing to Fig. 1, the systems concerned by the invention are mobile communication system with smart antenna and inference cancellation or wireless communication system such as wireless user loop system. Fig. 1 shows a base station structure of the system. It mainly includes N identical antenna units 201A, 201B, ..., 201i, ..., 201N; N almost identical feeder cable 202A, 202B, ..., 202i, ..., 202N; N radio frequency transceiver 203A, 203B, ..., 203i, ..., 203N and a baseband processor 204. All transceivers 203 use a same local oscillator 208 to guarantee that each radio frequency transceiver works in coherence. There are Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) and Digital to Analog Converter (DAC) in each radio frequency transceiver,<br><br>
sd all baseband input and output of radio frequency transceiver 203 are digital signal; tifey are connected with baseband processor by a high speed digital bus 209. In Fig. 1, block 100 shows base station devices.<br>
The invention only discusses interference cancellation of receiving signal in baseband processing shown in Fig. 1, without considering transmitting signal processing. Smart antenna implementation and interference cancellation is performed in baseband processor 204.<br>
Suppose the CDMA wireless communication system has K designed channels, smart antenna system is consisted of N antenna units, N feeder cables and N radio frequency transceivers, i. e. N links. In each receiving link, after sampling by ADC in radio transceiver, its output digital signals are S1 (n), S2 (n), ..., Si (n), ..., SN (n), where n is nth chip. Taking ith receiving link as an example, after sampling its receiving signal by ADC in 203i radio frequency transceiver, its output digital signal is 5, (n), which is input signal for baseband processor 204. Baseband processor 204 includes channel estimation module 210A, 210B, ..., 210i, ..., 210N, which correspond to N radio frequency transceiver 203A, 203B, ..., 203i, ..., 203N of N links respectively, and smart antenna interference cancellation module 211; output digital signals of N links 5; (n), S2 (n), ..., S2 (n), ..., SN (n) are sent to channel estimation module 210A, 210B, ..., 210i, ..., 210N respectively, they are also sent to smart antenna interference cancellation module 211; channel response signals<br>
h1,,h2,...hi,...hN which correspond to outputs of channel estimation module 210A, 210B, ..., 210i, ..., 210N respectively, are sent to smart antenna interference cancellation module 211; smart antenna inference cancellation module 211 outputs synchronous adjustment parameter Ss (K) to down link transmitting module and outputs interference cancellation result Sca+i,k (d) to channel decode module, where<br>
ft, = [hi1, hi,2,..., hik]-<br>
When Si (n) enter channel estimation module 210i, with a beforehand known training sequence (Pilot or Midamble), K channels are estimated and K channels pulse response hi,k are got, where / shows Ith antenna unit and k shows Ath channel <br>
The specific processing procedure is as following. Suppose Kth user's known twining sequence is mk, received training sequence from ith antenna is ei, then there is formula (1):<br>
(Formula Removed)where n is nth chip, w is length of searching window and noi is white noise received from ith antenna. Formula (1) can be further rewritten as formula (2):<br>
(Formula Removed)then, channel estimation can be shown as formula (3):<br>
(Formula Removed)where M is a matrix, which only relates with every user training sequence and can be calculated and stored in advance; as it is unnecessary to calculate it in real time, channel estimation will be greatly speeded up.<br>
According to procedure above, responses of all users in all channels can be calculated respectively, the results hi,k are inputted to smart antenna inference cancellation module 211; after further processing, all user signal will be recovered.<br>
Referencing to Fig. 2, it shows interference cancellation processing of smart antenna interference cancellation module 211. First, channel response hi,k , calculated by channel estimation module 210i, is sent to power estimation module 220 to estimate power; main path and multipath power distribution of K users (with K channels) in searching window are calculated, it is shown with formula (4):<br>
(Formula Removed)Then, maximum peak power point of each user is calculated; if a user most powerful path is not at the same point of other users most powerful path, then it means that the user does not synchronize with base station; the base station will inform the user in down link channel to adjust in order to keep synchronization with other users; adjustment parameter is SS(K) said above.And then,Kth user main path and multipath total power distribution in searching window is calculated, it is shown with formula (5):<br>
(Formula Removed)where mis a point in searching window, the power_abs is sent to signal generator 221 to generate signal; at the same time, signals, sent to signal generator 221, also have<br>
channel response signal hl,h2,...hi,...hn (vector), outputted by each channel estimation module 210A, 210B, ..., 210i, ..., 210N respectively, and output digital signal Si(n), S2(n), ..., Si(n),..., sN(n) of N links.<br>
In signal generator 221, first, a position of peak value point in power_abs is calculated and stored in power_point; at the same time, set power_abs (power_point) = 0 to make it is unnecessary to calculate this point when making next interference; then, de-spread result of all signals at this point is got with smart antenna algorithm on the power_point; it is shown with formula (6):<br>
(Formula Removed)where Cqkk is Kth user spread spectrum code, pn_code(l) is scramble code, Sca,k(d) is interference cancellation result of last time, initial value So,k(d) = 0 and output Sca+irfd) is symbolic level. Obviously, as users are not totally synchronized and there are severe multipath inference and white noise in system, Sca+1,k(d) is a rough result, at initial.<br>
Sca+1,k(d) is sent to signal/noise ratio estimating module 224 and signal reconstructing module 222. Function of signal/noise ratio estimating module 224 is to estimate each user signal/noise ratio; signal generated by signal generator 221 is a de-scrambled, de-spread and demodulated signal; at this time, there are many methods to estimate each user signal/noise ratio, one of them is: for Kth user, calculate its power first, it is shown with formula (7):<br>
(Formula Removed)If the power is greater than a certain field value, then it is known as effective power; for all the signals with effective power calculate its square difference on correspond point of constellation map; if the square difference is greater than preset value, then signal/noise ratio of this user is comparatively low and its Sca+i,k(d) value is unbelievable, so interference cancellation is needed; on the contrary, if the square difference is less than preset value, then signal/noise ratio of this user is comparatively high and its Sca+i,k(d) value is believable, so interference cancellation is unneeded. Purpose of using signal/noise ratio estimating module is to simplify calculation of interference cancellation, as it is unnecessary to cancel interference for believable signal.<br>
Signal reconstructing module 222 uses Sca+i,k(d) to reconstruct the original signal, which is chip level and shown with formula (8):<br>
(Formula Removed)Then, calculate components of K users on N antennas, it is shown with formula (9):<br>
(Formula Removed)The recovered results of N antennas are sent to interference cancellation module 223 to cancel the interference, shown with formula (10):<br>
(Formula Removed)In Fig. 2, function of deciding module 225 is used to decide when interference cancellation will be stopped with two deciding conditions: (1) signal/noise ratio of all signals are greater than set field value, (2) numbers of loop of interference cancellation reach set number, which is less or equal to length of search window and within this range numbers of loop are decided by processing capability of digital signal processor, FPGA chip and so on. When either of the two conditions is satisfied, processing procedure of interference cancellation method of smart antenna is ended and recovered signal Sca+1,k (d) is outputted.<br>
Referencing to Fig. 3, taking 8 antennas (N = 8) as an example to explain processing procedure of interference cancellation method for smart antenna.Functional block 301 calculates channel estimation power by power estimating mecfule 220; functional block 303 and 304 search for maximum value of power by signal generator module 221, calculate difference and set the value to 0, de-spread it at its difference point and make beam forming, then the result is sent, at the same time, to signal/noise ratio decision module 225 and signal reconstructing module 222 (through decision module 225); functional block 302 sends synchronized adjustment value Ss(k); functional block 308 reconstructs signal and calculates its components on these 8 antennas; functional block 309 subtracts components on 8 antennas of reconstructed data from receive_data, stores the result in receive_data, then functional block 303 to functional block 309 is executed repeatedly. When functional block 305 decides magnitude of signal/noise ratio by signal/noise ratio decision module 224, and functional block 306 decides, by decision module 225, numbers of loop have reached set value or all users signal/noise ratio has been satisfied, then interference cancellation is ended and functional block 307 outputs recovered signal.<br>

Any engineer, who works on development of wireless communication system, has knowledge of smart antenna principle and digital signal processing, can use method of the invention to design a high-qualified smart antenna system, which can be used on various mobile communication or wireless user loop system with high performance.<br><br><br><br>
