				<td>The present invention relates to textile processing, in particular, although not exclusively to textile dyeing.<br>
In the dyeing industry colour and shade variation are amongst the most important considerations when judging dyeing quality. One of the main problems is repeatability from batch to batch.<br>
This problem is particularly acute during the sample submission stage, which occurs at the beginning of a production process. A dyeing machine takes around seven hours to complete each dyeing cycle. During the sample submission stage a number of different samples will be prepared of various colours and/or shades. However, it is not generally considered economical to spend several days preparing a batch of different samples. Therefore, many small capacity yarn package dyeing machines are used at the same time to prepare separate samples for the batch of samples. However, if the sample submission process requires submission of a number of yarn packages of the same colour and/or shade, several small capacity dyeing machines may not be able to produce a uniform dyeing results for all the samples.<br>
Preferred embodiments of the present invention seek to provide an improved textile dyeing system.<br>
The present invention provides a textile processing system comprising two textile processing machines, interconnected by a valve means, which valve means is selectively movable between a first position wherein said textile processing machines operate independently, and a second position, wherein said textile machines are in fluid flow communication.<br>
The valve means may comprise one or more valves. Suitably, the valve means comprises two valves for each textile processing machine.<br>
Any suitable valve may be used. Preferably, each of the one of more valves comprises a body having four ports therein and a connection means. Suitably, the four ports are equidistantly spaced about the periphery of the body. Suitably, the body has a substantially circular cross-sectional shape.   The connection means provides two fluid<br>
passageways arranged to interconnect one each of two adjacent pairs of said four ports. The connection means is preferably substantially symmetrical, with the two fluid passageways having substantially the same conformation. The connection means is preferably movable relative to the body to allow for selective connection of different adjacent pairs of ports.<br>
A textile processing system according to the present invention may comprise more than two textile processing machines. In this case, the valve means may be additionally movable to a position wherein some of the more than two machines are independently operable and others of the more than two machines are in fluid flow communication with yet others of the more than two machines.<br>
The present invention may further comprise a common dosing system for the two or more textile processing machines. The dosing system may comprise one or more valves located to allow either independent dosing to each machine, or common dosing to all of the textile processing machines in the system.<br>
The dosing system may comprise any suitable arrangement, but preferably comprises a separate dosing tank for each textile processing machine in the textile processing system. Suitably, the separate dosing tanks are interconnected to allow transfer of fluid between the tanks. The separate dosing tanks may be selectively interconnected.<br>
A textile processing system according to the present invention may comprise any suitable type of textile processing machine, including fabric dyeing machines and yarn dyeing machines. The textile processing machines of the present invention may comprise small capacity (e.g. laboratory scale) machines commonly used for preparation of sample. Alternatively, the textile processing machines of the present invention may comprise standard capacity machines commonly used for full scale processing of textile products.<br>
The present invention further comprises a textile processing machine having a processing fluid circulation system comprising two valves therein, which valves are operable to divert the direction of circulation of processing fluid between a first direction, wherein the processing fluid is removed from the textile processing machine and re-circulated directly back to the same textile processing machine, and a second position, wherein the<br>
processing fluid is removed from the textile processing machine and diverted for circulation through another associated textile processing machine.<br>
Statement of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides a textile processing system comprising two or more textile processing machines, interconnected by a valve means, which valve means is selectively movable between a first position wherein said textile processing machines operate independently, and a second position, wherein said textile machines are in fluid flow communication.<br>
The fabric processing machine of the present invention may be used in the fabric processing system of the present invention as described above.<br>
Preferred embodiments of the present invention advantageously provide a more flexible processing system. If the system comprises two machines, then each one can be used independently to produce a separate product. Alternatively, both machines may be interconnected to be used together in production of a single product.<br>
Furthermore, if the textile processing system comprises more than two textile processing machines, the system advantageously further allows some of the machines in the system to produce one product and others in the system to produce a different product and so on.<br>
In addition, any number of machines can be linked together to form the system to provide increased flexibility of the system.<br>
Use of a common dosing system advantageously facilitates more consistent processing results across a plurality of textile processing machines.<br>
Any feature of any embodiment may be combined with any other embodiment of the invention.<br>
The present invention will now be explained, by way of example only, with reference to the following schematic drawings, in which:<br>
Figure I shows a cross-sectional side view of a single yarn package dyeing machine suitable for use in a system according to the present invention;<br>
Figure 2 shows a cross-sectional side view of a multi-machine system comprising a plurality of the yarn package dyeing machines of figure 1, arranged with common circulation between the plurality of machines;<br>
Figure 3 shows a cross-sectional side view of a multi-machine system comprising a plurality of the yarn package dyeing machines of figure 1, arranged with two separate circulation groups within the plurality of machines, and<br>
Figure 4 shows a cross-sectional side view of a multi-machine system comprising a plurality of the yarn package dyeing machines of figure 1, arranged with common circulation between the plurality of machines and further comprising a common dosing system.<br>
Turning first to figure 1. The basic operation of a yarn package dyeing machine requires dye liquor to circulate within the machine passing through the wall of the yarn package from the inside to the outside and vice versa. Figure 1 shows the dye liquor circulating from the interior to the exterior 18 of the yarn package 2. Although the package 2 comprises yarn wound around a dye tube, the package could instead comprise fabric wound around a dye tube.<br>
The yarn package dyeing machine of figure 1 comprises a vessel 1, a pipe system 3, 5, 11, 17, a circulation pump 4, and two valves 8, 15.<br>
The two valves 8, 15 each comprises a body having four ports therein 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16, and a connection means. The connections means providing two fluid passageways arranged to interconnect one each of two adjacent pairs of said four ports. Said connections means being movable relative to said body to allow for selective connection of different adjacent pairs of ports.<br>
In the embodiment shown in figure 1, the valves 8, 15 are connected in the pipe system 3, 5, 11, 17 such that the machine is set up for independent operation. In operation of the yarn package dyeing machine dye liquor is supplied to the vessel 1. The dye liquor will be circulated around the machine by means of the pump 4. Dye liquor is drawn from the vessel 1 into pipe 17 to enter the first valve 15 through port 16. The dye liquor will exit valve 15 through port 12 and enter pipe 11. The liquor then flows on to port 10 of the second valve 8 and through the valve 8 to leave through port 6. The liquor flows on into pipe 5 before reaching the circulation pump 4. The pump 4 forces the liquor along pipe 3<br>
and back into the vessel 1 to flow from the interior to the exterior of the yarn package 2 before the cycle begins again.<br>
The valves 8, 15 are both set in position one, wherein one of the pairs of ports are connected to the circulation pipework. When the first 16 and second 12 ports of the first valve 15 are connected to the circulation system the third 13 and fourth 14 ports of valve 15 are unconnected, and preferably closed. When the third 10 and fourth 6 ports of the second valve 8 are connected to the circulation system the first 7 and second 9 ports of valve 8 are unconnected, and preferably closed.<br>
Turning now to figure 2. The system of figure 2 is illustrated having three yarn package dyeing machines 31, 32, 33 as described above in relation to figure 1. It will be apparent to a skilled person that the system could comprise two or more yarn package dyeing machines, as desired, in the manner illustrated.<br>
The first machine 31 is connected to the second machine 32 by means of pipes 34 and 37; the second machine 32 is connected to the third machine 33 by means of pipes 35 and 40.<br>
As can be seen from figure 2, the second valves 36 of machine one 31, the first and second valves 38, 39 of machine two 32 and the first valves 41 of machine three 33 are positioned in the second position, wherein both pairs of port are connected into the circulation pipework. The first valve 42 of machine one 31, and the second valve 43 of the third machine 33 are connected in the first position, with one only of the two pairs of ports connected in the circulation pipework.<br>
The arrangement illustrated in figure 2 forms a single circulation circuit across all three machines 31, 32, 33.<br>
Figure 3 shows the same machines 31, 32, 33 of figure 2 with the same pipes and valves as figure 2. However, the arrangement of figure 3 shows the first and second valves 42, 36 of machine one 3 3 set to the first position to form a separate circulation circuit such that machine one 31 operates independently of machines two 32 and three 33. The second valve 39 of machine two 32 and the first valve 41 of machine three 33 are set to the second position.   The first valve 38 of machine two 32 and the second valve 43 of<br>
machine three 33 are set to the first position. Thereby creating a circulation circuit including machines two and three 32, 33.<br>
Figure 4 shows the circulation arrangement of figure 2, wherein the circulation circuit interconnects all of machines one, two and three 31, 32, 33, and further illustrates a dosing system that may be additionally incorporated into such an arrangement. Since the circulation system is as described above in relation to figure 2, it will not be described again here.<br>
The dosing system shown in figure 4 comprises a first dosing tank 52 associated with the first machine 31, a second dosing tank 53 associated with the second machine 32 and a third dosing tank 55 associated with the third machine 33.<br>
The dosing system is arranged such that dye liquor 51 can be transferred from the first dosing tank 52, to the second dosing tank 53, dye liquor 54 can be transferred from the second dosing tank 53 to the third dosing tank 55, and dye liquor 56 can be transferred from the third dosing tank 55 to the first dosing tank 52. This arrangement facilitates even mixing of the dye liquor contains in all three dosing tanks 52, 53, 55.<br>
In use of the dosing system shown in figure 4, each dosing tank 52, 53, 55 are initially filled with dye liquor 51, 54, 56. Then a first dosing pump 57 associated with the first dosing tank 52 pumps dye liquor 51 to a fourth valve 58 of the first machine 31, then the liquor passes through a third valve 59 of the second machine 32 and enters the second dosing tank 53. At the same time a second dosing pump 63 associated with the second dosing tank 53 pumps dye liquor 54 to a fourth valve 61 of the second machine 32, then the liquor passes through a third valve 62 of the third machine 33 and enters the third dosing tank 55. At the same time a third dosing pump 64 associated with the third dosing tank 55 pumps dye liquor 56 to a fourth valve 45 of the third machine 33, then the liquor passes through a third valve 60 of the first machine 31 and enters the first dosing tank 52.<br>
As can be seen from figure 4, the fourth valve 58 of the first machine 31, the third 59 and fourth 61 valves of the second machine 32 and the third valve 62 of the third machine 33 are all set to the second position, wherein both pairs of parts are connected to the pipework system.  The third valve 60 of the first machine 31 and the fourth valve 45 of<br>
the third machine 33 are set to the first position, wherein only one of the pairs of ports are connected to the pipework system.<br>
Once a required concentration of dye liquor 51, 54, 56 has been achieved in all three tanks 52, 53, 55 then the dye liquor will be diverted to the vessel of each machine 31, 32, 33 by means of three way valves 65, 66, 67.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
