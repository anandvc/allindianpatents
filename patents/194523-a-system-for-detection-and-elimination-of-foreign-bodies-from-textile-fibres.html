				<td>The present invention relates to a system for detection and removal or roreign ouui^b from textile fibres.<br>
Usually, foreign materials are found to be present in textile fibres such as in raw cotton. Foreign material present in the raw cotton are of two types, one which consists of parts of the cotton plant namely seed coat fragments, leaf particles and other portions of the cotton plant which are likely to remain along with the cotton even after the process of harvesting cotton, and the other which consists of impurities like jute threads, cloth fragments, paper, polythene, hairs etc which get introduced during the process of harvesting or in the process of transporting the material from one place to the other.<br>
The presence of these foreign material greatly affects the quality of the yarn produced in the textile mill. During the process in a textile-mill some of these foreign material get removed but it is not possible to remove them once they are broken into small fragments in the later stages of the textile process. These foreign material ultimately shows up in the yarn and result in poor quality of the fabric. It is thus essential to remove these foreign matter from the cotton in the initial stages of the textile process where the relative size of the matter is reasonably higher.<br>
US Pat. 5692622 dated 2nd December 1997 and 5626237 dated 6th May 1997, discloses devices which are used for removal of such foreian material from textile fibres. However, such known devices suffer from many disadvantages : 1) the system is complex in construction and further complicated by the use of an array of simple colour sensors. 2) Systems are not able to move the material at a uniform speed thus resulting in frequent blow outs as a result of distortion in the images captured thereby reducing the production efficiency of the system.<br>
Moreover, the use of colour sensors in such known devices on the other hand also<br><l results in the following disavantages namely></l>
1.	by using colour sensors the system construction becomes bulky as many sensors are required to be placed to cover the entire width of the system.<br>
2.	It becomes difficult to precisely determine the size of the object.<br><br>
3.	The performance of the system deteriorates with the colour variations of the cotton and the background.<br>
4.	Calibration of the system is a rather tedious process and has to be repeated every time the material is changed.<br>
5.	The system necessitates the requirement of special lighting devises.<br>
It is thus the basic objective of the present invention to provide a system for detection and removal of foreign material from textile fibres which would avoid the aforesaid disadvantages of presently known devices.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a system for detection and removal of foreign material from textile fibres which would be simple to manufacture and at the same time will be extremely reliable.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is directed to provide for a system for detection and removal of foreign material which would provide for selective removal of foreign material of only selected sizes.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is directed to provide for a system for detection and removal of foreign material from textile fibres which would provide for selective removal of foreign material and avoid accompanying wastage of fibres.<br>
Thus according to the present invention there is provided a system for detection and elimination of foreign bodies from textile fibres comprising :<br>
means to transport uniform fibre web at predetermined and selected   uniform<br>
speed for presenting to an imaging system ;<br>
said imaging system comprising CCD camera means for obtaining images of<br>
the moving fibre web ;<br>
means for  analyzing  the said images  of  the  fibre  web and detecting the<br>
presence of foreign material if any ;<br>
means for removal of the detected foreign material from said fibre web.<br>
The system described herein before of the invention is a simple to operate but highly reliable in as far as effective removal of foreign material is concerned. The system<br><br>
uses a belt to transport the fibre flocks at a unirorm speea Dy creaung a unirorm weu of fibre flock in the process and presenting this web to an imaging system consisting of a special CCD camera which captures the images of the moving fibre flock. The images obtained are further processed to analyse and detect the presence of the foreign material. Once the system detects a foreign matter, the portion of the fibre containing the foreign material is removed from the main stream and prevented from going to the further processing stages.<br>
The system of the invention utilizes a simple but reliable transport mechanism where the textile material such as cotton material is formed into a uniform web and is positively conveyed using a conveyer belt and utilizes a CCD camera to capture images of the cotton web and processing the images in a high speed computer to detect the presence of foreign material. Further the system is able to cope up with the minor changes in the speed of the material by triggering the camera at a constant pace relative to the speed of the conveyor belt. Such a system ensures the foreign material of only the selected size is removed from the process. Another important feature of the device is that only a small portion of the material containing the foreign material is removed, this is made possible with the array of air nozzles provided and the fact that the material is transported with a positive contact with the belt there by leaving no chance for the material to move laterally, perpendicular to the movement of the belt.<br>
*	*	*<br>
The system of the invention is described hereunder in greater detail with reference to non-limiting exemplary embodiments with reference to the accompanying figures wherein :<br>
Fig. 1 is a schematic illustration of an embodiment of the system of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Fig. 2 is a schematic illustration of another embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Fig. 3 is a schematic illustration of yet another embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Reference is first invited to Figure 1 wherein 1 represents the Condenser unit, a standard equipment in a blow room line. The condenser unit helps in drawing the material from the previous stage, which is often a beater or a step cleaner, and drops<br><br>
the material into the Hood 2. The Hood consists of a pair of lattice 3 which is positively driven. The lattice helps in conveying the material at a uniform rate and to the entire width of the feed rollers 4. The system is so devised that the lattice and the feed rollers are driven by the same drive and functions only if a predetermined quantity of cotton is present in the Hood i.e. between the pair of lattice. The amount of cotton present in the hood is sensed by a sensor 16, which can a be a simple reflective sensor. The output of this sensor is used to directly control the feed motor. Further it is possible to vary the distance between the feed rollers and also its relative distance from the conveyer belt 6 so as to produce a uniform web of cotton. The cotton web so formed by the pair of feed rollers on the belt is further leveled by the leveler roller 5. This web is now presented under a CCD camera 11 which can be of type line scan or a frame scan. The web is illuminated by two pairs of flourescent tubes. The image of the web is reflected by the mirror 10 on to the camera. 7 represents the set of rollers used to move the belt at a fixed speed. The camera is interfaced to the PC 13 through a frame grabber 12. 14 represents an array of nozzles used to divert the contaminants away from the main stream. An encoder 8 is attached to one of the rollers 7 used to drive the belt. The output of the encoder is used to trigger the camera through the frame grabber. This ensures the camera is operated at a fixed speed relative to the speed of the belt.<br>
As described above the camera is triggered at a constant speed relative to the speed of the belt and since the relative distance of the camera from the ebject is fixed it is possible to calculate the horizontal and vertical resolution of the image. With this it #T'3 also possible to calculate the area represented by each pixel. Each frame of the image is first acquired by the frame grabber and then transferred to the PC memory sequentially. The image is first binarised by determining the threshold value for every individual frame. In this binarised by applying a process of blob detection the shape of the foreign matter is determined. The number of dark pixels in a blob multiplied by the area gives the size of the foreign matter. If this value is above a set limit the portion of the contaminant is removed by activating the corresponding nozzle aligned laterally along the width of the belt.<br>
Reference  is  now   invited  to   Fig.   2  which  shows  the  system   as  a  different embodiment. In this embodiment  the belt is of transparent type to help analyse the<br><br>
flocks of fibres m both top and ootom sides For this, another set of light sources 9 and camera 11 are provided under moving conveyor belt The system functions simitar to that as explained under embodiment 1 above The signals are analyzed suitably to exactly detect and eliminate foreign bodies.<br>
Reference is now invited to Fig, 3 which shows another embodiment of the system of the invention wherein there is provided means for analyzingflie fibre flocks on both the sides i.e. top and bottom Here, this is achieved by providing a reversal mechanism and allowing the fibres to fall on the reverse side on a separate conweyor belt where the fibres can be observed by means of an additional light source. In this arrangement the transport means provide for turning the fibre flock by 180°C and transported to another belt for repeat inspection as shown in Fig. 3.<br>
In the system of the invention the means for removal of the detected foreign material can comprise of the array of air nozzles or can be devised with different arrangements for removal of foreign materials after detection. One such arrangement causes removal by means of a mechanical arm which plucks the fibres out of the moving belt and disposes to a separate collecting apparatus or another suction mechanism. The removal mechanism can also solely comprise of a suction arrangement to arrest the detected foreign material.<br>
The'abovedisclos-d system of the invention thus provides for a simple but reliable system for removal of foreign material from fibre flock. The system is ea4sy tc5 obtain and also cost effective for varied applications in textile industry.<br><br><br><br><br>
