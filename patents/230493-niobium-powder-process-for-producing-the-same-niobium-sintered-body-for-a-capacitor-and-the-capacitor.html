The present invention relates to niobium powder, process for producing the same, niobium sintered body for a capacitor and the capacitor. CROSS REFERENCE  TO THE  RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This is an application based on the prescription of 35 U.S.C. Section 111(a) with claiming the benefit of filing date of U.S. Provisional application Serial No. 60/291,925 filed May 21, 2001 and Serial No. 60/331,200 filed November 9, 2001 under the provision of 35 U.S.C.Ill(b), pursuant to 35 U.S.C. Section 119(e)(1).<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a niobium powder and a sintered body thereof, which can stably produce a capacitor having a large capacitance per unit mass, good leakage current characteristics and excellent moisture resistance, and also relates to a capacitor using the niobium powder and sintered body and production methods of niobium powder, sintered body and the capacitor.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Capacitors for use in electronic instruments such as portable telephone and personal computer are demanded to have a small size and a large capacitance. Among these capacitors, a tantalum capacitor is preferred because of<br><br>
its large capacitance for the size and good performance-<br>
Moreover, recent electronic devices are demanded to operate at a low voltage and high frequency with low noise, and also a lower equivalent series resistance (ESR) is required for a solid electrolyte capacitor.<br>
In this tantalum capacitor, a sintered body of tantalum powder is generally used for the anode moiety. This powder is molded and then sintered, whereby the powder is integrated and works out to an electrode called a sintered body. The inside of this sintered body takes a three-dimensional complicated form resulting from the particles of the powder being electrically and mechanically connected with each other. On the surface of this sintered body including the surface of the inside void, a dielectric film layer is formed and thereinto, a material as a counter electrode is impregnated, whereby a capacitor is fabricated. As long as the dielectric film layer uniformly adheres to the inside or outside surface of the sintered body, the capacitance of the capacitor manufactured greatly depends on, microscopically, the contact state of the counter electrode material with the dielectric film layer.<br>
In order to increase the capacitance of the tantalum capacitor, it is necessary to increase the mass of the sintered body or to use a sintered body increased in the surface area by pulverizing the tantalum powder.<br>
The method of increasing the mass of the sintered body necessarily involves enlargement of the capacitor shape and<br>
3<br><br>
:annot satisfy the requirement for downsizing. On the other land, in the method of pulverizing tantalum powder to Increase the specific surface area, the pore diameter of :he tantalum sintered body decreases or closed pores Increase at the stage of sintering, as a result, Impregnation of the cathode agent at a later step becomes difficult.<br>
For example, assuming that when an aqueous phosphoric acid solution is used as a counter electrode material, the :;ontact state of the solution with a dielectric film layer is complete and the capacitance appearance ratio (also ::alled a cathode agent impregnation ratio) at the time is 100%, a capacitance appearance ratio of 100% can be hardly attained in the case of using a counter electrode material leaving high viscosity, particularly a solid electrode material. In particular, when the average particle size of tantalum powder is small or the sintered body manufactured from a tantalum powder has a large shape, the difficulty increases and in an extreme case, the capacitance appearance ratio cannot reach even 50%. With such a low capacitance appearance ratio, the capacitor manufactured cannot have a sufficiently high moisture resistance.<br>
In case the tantalum powder to produce a tantalum sintered body has a small pore diameter, it essentially leads to a small pore diameter of the tantalum sintered body and a low capacitance appearance ratio.  Consequently, a problem arises that an ESR cannot be lowered.<br>
h<br><br>
As one of means for solving these problems, a capacitor using a sintered body as an electrode may be considered, which sintered body is produced using an electrode material providing a dielectric material having a dielectric constant larger than that of tantalum and gives a high capacitance appearance ratio.<br>
As such an electrode material which can be supplied industrially, niobium having a dielectric constant larger than that of tantalum and having a large reserve is known.<br>
JP-A-55-157226 (the term "JP-A" as used herein means an "unexamined published Japanese patent application") discloses a method for producing a sintered device for capacitors, where agglomerated valve-acting metal powder having a particle size of 2.0 |Jin or less is molded under pressure and then sintered, the molded and sintered body is cut into fine pieces, a lead part is joined therewith and these are again sintered. However, the details on the producing method and properties of the niobium capacitor are not described in this patent publication.<br>
U.S. Patent 4,084,965 discloses a capacitor using a sintered body of niobium powder having an average particle size of 5.1 |Jin obtained by hydrogenating and pulverizing a niobium ingot. However, the capacitor disclosed has a large leakage current (hereinafter sometimes simply referred to as "LC") value and is of little practical use.<br>
JP-A-10-242004 (WO 98/38660) discloses a technique of partially nitriding a niobium powder and thereby improving<br>
S<br><br>
the LC value.<br>
The tapping density of a niobium powder for a capacitor is an important factor in molding operation of the niobium powder. The tapping density of conventional niobium powder is 2.5 g/ml or more, specifically about 4 g/ml, and this is insufficient for the molding.<br>
That is, if such a niobium powder is molded and sintered to prepare a sintered body, the niobium powder poorly flows from the hopper of a molding machine to the metal mold and it is difficult to weigh a constant amount of niobium powder and flow it into the metal mold. As a result, it causes problems such that the shape of the molded article is not satisfactorily stabilized, the molded article and the sintered body are deficient in the strength, and a capacitor having bad LC is produced frequently. If a special molding apparatus capable of also handling a powder having bad flowability is used, the molding cost excessively increases and this is not practical.<br>
As such, conventionally known niobium powder for capacitors has a problem that the powder cannot be fully adapted to continuous molding and the productivity of capacitors is low.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a capacitor having a large capacitance per unit mass, a small leakage current and a high moisture resistance; a sintered<br>
fc<br><br>
body usable as the electrode material of this capacitor and capable of giving a high capacitance appearance ratio; a niobium powder being preferred as the material for this sintered body, exhibiting good flowability in the molding operation, facilitating continuous molding and enabling stable production of capacitors; and the production methods of the capacitor, the sintered body and the niobium powder.<br>
As a result of extensive investigations to solve the above-described problems, the present inventors have found that when a niobium sintered body having a specific pore distribution, preferably having a plurality of pore diameter peak tops in the pore distribution is used for the capacitor electrode, a high capacitance appearance ratio can be obtained and a capacitor having small leakage current and good moisture resistance can be produced. The present inventors also have found that a niobium powder preferably having a tapping density of 0.5 to 2.5 g/ml, more preferably having an average particle size of 10 to 1,000 |Lim exhibits good flowability, enables continuous molding and is preferred as the material for the above-described sintered body and when this niobium powder is used, a capacitor having small leakage current can be stably produced. The present inventors have found that more preferably, both a high capacitance appearance ratio and low ESR can be achieved with a capacitor wherein the electrodes use a niobium sintered body produced by using a niobium powder having a wide range of pore distribution and<br>
^<br><br>
a plural pore diameter peak tops all of which are 0.5 |Jm or more. The present invention has been accomplished based on these findings.<br>

The niobium powder for capacitors is added to a solution obtained by dissolving a binder which is described later, in an organic solvent such as toluene or methanol, and thoroughly mixed using a shaking mixer or a V-type mixer. Then, the organic solvent is distilled off under reduced pressure using a drier such as conical drier to prepare a niobium mixed powder containing the binder. This mixed powder is charged into the hopper of an automatic molding machine, weighed while flowing the niobium powder through an inlet tube from the hopper to the metal mold of the molding machine to automatically cause spontaneous falling in the metal mold, and molded together with a lead wire. After removing the binder, this molded article is sintered at 500 to 2,000°C under reduced pressure to manufacture a niobium sintered body.<br>
The niobium sintered body is electrochemically formed, for example, in a electrolyte solvent such as phosphoric acid and adipic acid of a concentration of 0.1 % by mass and 30°C to 90°C at a voltage from 20 to 60 V for 1 to 30 hours to form a dielectric layer mainly comprising a niobium oxide. A solid electrolyte layer such as manganese dioxide, lead dioxide and conductive polymer and a graphite layer and a silver paste layer are formed on the dielectric<br>
^ <br>
layer. After a cathode terminal is connected thereon by soldering, these are sealed with a resin to fabricate a solid electrolyte capacitor.<br>
In the case of a mixed powder having no appropriate flowability or angle of repose in molding, the powder does not smoothly flow from the hopper to the metal mold and the molding cannot be stably performed. In particular, since the mixed powder is transported from the hopper using a method such as vibration, too large or too small tapping density or average particle size of the mixed powder leads to large dispersion in the mass of the molded article or in the strength or shape of the sintered body and in some cases, to the generation of chipping or cracking, resulting in a bad leakage current value. Thus, the tapping density, the average particle size, the flowability and the angle of repose of the mixed powder are important factors for producing a good sintered body and a good capacitor.<br>
These physical properties of the mixed powder scarcely change between before and after the mixing with a binder but are determined by the physical properties of the niobium powder for capacitors used. Accordingly, important are the tapping density, the average particle size, the flowability and the angle of repose of the niobium powder used. The flowability and the angle of repose of the niobium powder are greatly affected by the tapping density or the average particle size and therefore, the tapping density and the average particle size become important<br>
OX<br><br>
factors.<br>
In the present invention, for increasing the productivity and the strength of the sintered body accompanying the improvement of the flowability or the angle of repose and thereby obtaining an effect of reducing the leakage current, the tapping density is preferably from 0.5 to 2.5 g/ml, more preferably from 0.8 to 1.9 g/ml. The average particle size of the niobium powder of the present invention is preferably from 10 to 1,000 |jm, more preferably from 50 to 200 |jra.<br>
For allowing the niobium powder to spontaneously fall from the hopper to the metal mold of a molding machine, the angle of repose of the niobium powder of the present invention is preferably from 10° to 60°, more preferably from 10° to 50°.<br>
The niobium powder having the above-described physical properties can be produced starting from a mixture (hereinafter referred to as '^a starting material mixture") containing a niobium powder or a niobium compound powder (hereinafter these are called ^^a starting material niobium powder") and an activator (also called "pore forming material", and hereinafter sometimes referred to as "an additive") through at least a sintering step and a cracking step in sequence.<br>
The activator is removed at either the sintering step or the cracking step during the production of the niobium powder of the present invention from the starting material<br>
^3<br><br>
mixture. The removal of the activator may also oe perrormea independently from the sintering step or the cracking step.<br>
Various methods for removing the activator can be arbitrarily employed according to the chemical properties of the activator. One of the methods capable of easily removing the activator may be used or a plurality of these methods may be used in combination.<br>
Examples of the method for removing the activator include a method of evaporating, sublimating or thermally decomposing the activator and removing it as a gas, and a method of removing the activator by dissolving it in a solvent.<br>
In the case of removing the activator as a gas, the removal may be performed at the sintering step, or a step of removing the activator under heating and/or reduced pressure may be provided before the sintering.<br>
In the case of removing the activator by dissolving it in a solvent after the sintering of the starting material mixture or during or after the cracking, a solvent which is described later is contacted with the sintered product or a cracked product thereby dissolving and removing the activator.<br>
A step of nitriding, boronizing, carbonizing or sulfudizing a part of niobium powder may be provided at any stage in the process of producing the niobium powder of the present invention from the starting material mixture.<br>
The method for producing the niobium powder of the<br>
5^<br><br>
present invention is described in detail below.<br>
The starting material niobium powder may be at least one powder selected from niobium, niobium hydride, niobium alloy and niobium hydride alloy. A part of the powder may be nitrided, sulfudized, carbonized or boronized. The "alloy" as used in the present invention includes a solid solution with other alloy component.<br>
The average particle size of the starting material niobium powder is preferably from 0.01 to 10 |Lim, more preferably 0.02 to 5 pm, still more preferably from 0.05 to 2 |jm.<br>
Examples of the method for obtaining niobium used as the starting material niobium powder include a method of hydrogenating, pulverizing and dehydrogenating a niobium ingot, a niobium pellet or a niobium powder, a method of reducing potassium fluoroniobate with sodium or the like and pulverizing the reduction product, a method of reducing niobium oxide using at least one of hydrogen, carbon, magnesium and aluminum and pulverizing the reduction product, and a method of hydrogen-reducing niobium halide.<br>
Examples of the method for obtaining niobium hydride used as the starting material niobium powder include a method of hydrogenating and pulverizing a niobium ingot, a niobium pellet or a niobium powder.<br>
Examples of the method for obtaining a niobium hydride alloy used as the starting material niobium powder include a method of pulverizing a hydride of niobium alloy ingot.<br>
(5^<br><br>
niobium alloy pellet or niobium alloy powder. Examples of the method for obtaining a niobium alloy used as the starting material niobium powder include a method of dehydrogenating a niobium hydride alloy obtained as above.<br>
The niobium alloy or niobium hydride alloy contains, as an alloy component other than niobium, at least one element selected from the group consisting of the elements having an atomic number of 88 or less excluding hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, niobium, helium, neon, krypton, argon, xenon and radon.<br>
The activator is a substance which can be removed at any step during the production of the niobium powder of the present invention from the starting material mixture. In the niobium powder of the present invention, a pore is usually formed in the portion where the activator is removed.<br>
The particle size of the activator affects the pore diameter of the niobium powder of the present invention, the pore diameter of the niobium powder affects the pore diameter of the niobium sintered body, and the pore diameter of the niobium sintered body affects the capacitance of a capacitor and the impregnating ability of a cathode agent in the production step of a capacitor.<br>
The impregnating ability of a cathode agent has a great influence in producing a capacitor with a high capacitance as well as a low ESR. As a niobium sintered body is produced by molding a niobium powder under pressure.<br>
c5b<br><br>
the pore diameter of the niobium sintered body is naturally smaller than that of the niobium powder. Considering the difficulty to impregnate a cathode agent to a niobium sintered body produced from a niobium powder having a .small pore diameter, the average pore diameter of a niobium powder is preferably 0.5 pm or more, and more preferably 1 lam or more.<br>
The average pore diameter of the niobium powder is preferably from 0.01 to 500 jam, more preferably from 0.03 to 300 fim, still more preferably from 0.1 to 200 ^m. For having a pore diameter in this range, the average particle size of the activator is preferably from 0.01 to 500 [xm, more preferably from 0.03 to 300 |jm, still more preferably from 0.1 to 200 Mm.<br>
The average pore diameter of the niobium powder is most preferably from 0.5 [xm to 100 |Lim, and the average particle size of the activator is most preferably from 0.5 to 100 |Jin.<br>
The pore diameter may be reduced by using an activator having a small particle size and the pore diameter may be increased by using an activator having a large particle size.<br>
The pore diameter distribution can be adjusted by adjusting the particle size distribution of the activator.<br>
In order to obtain a capacitor having a sufficiently large capacitance and free from problems involved in the impregnating ability of a cathode agent, it is preferred to<br>
a^<br><br>
appropriately provide pores small enough to give a desired capacitance and pores large enough to ensure satisfactory impregnation of a cathode agent, in the niobium sintered body according to the physical properties of the cathode agent.<br>
For adjusting the pore diameter distribution of the niobium powder or niobium sintered body, for example, the niobium powder can be made to have a pore diameter distribution having two or more peak tops by using an activator (powder) with a particle size distribution with two or more peak tops. By sintering this niobium powder, a niobium sintered body having two or more peak tops of equal pore diameter in the pore diameter distribution can be obtained. In this case, the pore diameter peak top is preferably present in the range of 0.01 to 500 pm, more preferably from 0.03 to 300 fom, still more preferably from 0.1 to 200 pm, particularly preferably from 0.1 to 30 |jm and most preferably from 0.2 to 3 |jm.<br>
The niobium powder to produce the niobium sintered body in above has a two or more peak tops in the particle size distribution. Any of the two or more peak tops is preferably 0.5 \m. or more. For example, to produce a niobium sintered body having two peak tops in the particle size distribution of 0.7 and 3 |iim, the two peak tops of the niobium powder may be adjusted to about 1.5 and about 25 fxm. To obtain a niobium powder having a small pore diameter of 1.5 fjm and having a large pore diameter of 25 }jm, the<br>
58"<br><br>
activator having an average pore diameter of 1.5 )jm and 25 pm is to be used respectively. Generally, when a pore of a small diameter and that of a large diameter are present in the niobium powder, a large diameter becomes small during molding under pressure. Therefore, a peak top of a large diameter is preferably 20 |Jin or more. Also, preferably 30% by volume or more of the entire pore volume has a pore diameter of 20 |jm or more, and more preferably 40% by volume or more.<br>
The above example is herein described with details based  on  drawings.    Figure  1  is  an  enlarged  view schematically  illustrating  the  niobium  powder  of  the present invention.  The niobium powder in Figure 1 is a granulated powder comprising a primary powder which has a specific pore diameter formed by an activator.  Pores (A) and (B) are formed by using an activator having an average diameter of about 1.5 |jin and about 25 fjiti respectively. Thus, it is possible to coagulate a primary powder to each other efficiently.  Figure 2 is an outline of a pore distribution of the niobium powder measured by a method of mercury penetration. Peak (A) is the peak corresponding to pore (A) formed by the activator having an average diameter of about 1.5 \m  and peak (B) is the peak corresponding to pore (B) formed by the activator having an average diameter of about 25 |jm respectively.  Peak (B) is higher than peak (A) and 44 % of the entire pore volume has a pore diameter of 20 pm or more,<br>
SI"]<br><br>
The activator having two or more peak tops in the particle size distribution can be obtained, for example, by mixing two or more activators having a different peak top in the particle size distribution.<br>
Examples of the substance as the activator include a substance which becomes a gas at the sintering temperature or lower, and a substance which is soluble in a solvent at least after the sintering.<br>
Examples of the substance which becomes a gas at the sintering temperature or lower include a substance which becomes a gas through evaporation, sublimation or thermal decomposition. An inexpensive substance capable of easily becoming a gas even at a low temperature without leaving a residue is preferred. Examples thereof include aromatic compounds such as naphthalene, anthracene and quinone, camphor, NH4CI, ZnO, VIO2,   SnOa, MnOa and organic polymers.<br>
Examples of the organic polymer include polyacrylic acid, polyacrylic acid ester, polyacrylamide, polymethacrylic acid, polyraethacrylic acid ester, polymethacrylamide and polyvinyl alcohol.<br>
The substance which is soluble at least after the sintering is a substance such that the residue of the activator or a thermally decomposed product thereof is soluble in a solvent. A substance capable of easily dissolving in a solvent which is described later, after the sintering, or during or after the cracking is particularly preferred.   Such a substance can be selected from many<br>
3&gt;o<br><br>
substances according to the combination with the solvent.<br>
Examples thereof include compounds of a metal with carbonic acid, sulfuric acid, sulfurous acid, halogen, perhalogen acid, hypohalogen acid, nitric acid, nitrous acid, phosphoric acid, acetic acid, oxalic acid or boric acid, metal oxides, metal hydroxides and metals.<br>
Among these, preferred are compounds having a large solubility in a solvent such as acid, alkali or ammonium salt solution which are described later. Examples thereof Include compounds containing at least one member selected from the group consisting of lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, cesium, francium, beryllium, magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium, radium, scandium, yttrium, cerium, aeodymium, erbium, titanium, zirconium, hafnium, vanadium, niobium, tantalum, molybdenum, tungsten, manganese, rhenium, ruthenium, osmium, cobalt, rhodium, iridium, nickel, palladium, platinum, silver, gold, zinc, cadmium, aluminum, gallium, indium, thallium, germanium, tin, lead, antimony, bismuth, selenium, tellurium, polonium, boron, silicon and arsenic. Among these, preferred are metal salts and more preferred are, for example, barium oxide, manganese(II) nitrate and calcium carbonate.<br>
These activators may be used individually or in combination of two or more thereof.<br>
To form a specific pore diameter efficiently, a substance which exists as a solid at a sintering temperature is preferable as the material of the activator.<br>
3<br><br>
The reason is that the activator being present in a solid state at a sintering temperature blocks excessive agglomeration of the primary niobium powder and allows the fusion of the niobium powder only at a contact point to each other. If the activator exists as a liquid or gas at a sintering temperature, it has a small effect to block such agglomeration and may form a smaller pore than desired. Consequently, a pore diameter becomes more stable with an activator comprising a substance of a higher melting point such as barium oxide, calcium carbonate, aluminum oxide and magnesium oxide than an activator.comprising a substance of a lower melting point such as an aluminum metal, magnesium metal, magnesium hydride and calcium metal.<br>
If the activator is added in a small amount, the tapping density and the angle of repose become large, whereas if added in a large amount, the tapping density becomes small and closed pores increase at the stage of sintering. For obtaining a repose angle of 60° or less and a tapping density of 0.5 to 2.5 g/ml without the problem of closed pores at the sintering stage, the amount of the activator added is generally from 1 to 40 mass% or less (unless otherwise indicated, mass% is hereinafter simply referred to as %) , preferably from 5 to 25%, more preferably from 10 to 20%, based on the starting material niobium, though this varies depending on the average particle size of the activator.<br>
The starting material mixture may be obtained by<br>
3^<br><br>
mixing the activator and the niobium starting material each in the powder form using no solvent or by mixing the activator and the niobium starting material using an appropriate solvent and drying the mixture.<br>
Examples of the solvent which can be used include water, alcohols, ethers, cellosolves, ketones, aliphatic hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons and halogenated hydrocarbons.<br>
The mixing may be performed using a mixer. As for the mixer, a normal apparatus such as shaking mixer, V-type mixer and Nauter mixer may be used without any problem. The temperature at the mixing is limited by the boiling point and freezing point of the solvent but is generally from -50°C to 120°C, preferably from -50°C to 50°C, more preferably from -10°C to 30°C. The time spent for the mixing is not particularly limited insofar as it is 10 minutes or more, however, the mixing is generally performed for 1 to 6 hours preferably in an oxygen-free atmosphere using an inert gas such as nitrogen or argon.<br>
In the case of using a solvent, the mixture obtained is dried at lower than 80°C, preferably lower than 50°C, using a conical drier or a compartment drier. If the mixture is dried at a temperature of 80°C or higher, the oxygen contained in the niobium or niobium hydride powder disadvantageously increases.<br>
In the case where the activator becomes a gas at the sintering temperature  or  lower,  the activator may be<br>
33<br><br>
removed at the sintering but a step of forming the activator into a gas and removing it before the sintering may be independently provided by setting the conditions such as temperature, pressure and time period to those of facilitating the removal according to the chemical properties of the activator. In this case, the activator is vaporized, for example, at 100°C to 800°C under reduced pressure within a few hours.<br>
In the case of using a niobium hydride or a niobium hydride alloy as the starting material niobium, the dehydrogenation can be attained irrespective of the kind of the activator by performing the above-described step.<br>
The sintering step is performed at 500°C to 2,000°C, preferably from 800°C to 1,500°C, more preferably from 1,000°C to 1,300°C, under reduced pressure or in a reducing atmosphere such as argon. After the completion of sintering, the sintered product is preferably cooled until the niobium temperature (sometimes simply referred to as a "product temperature") becomes SCC or less, an inert gas such as nitrogen or argon containing from 0.01 vol% to 10 vol%, preferably from 0.1 vol% to 1 vol% of oxygen is gradually added such that the product temperature does not exceed 30°C, and after standing for 8 hours or more,  the sintered product is taken out to obtain a sintered lump.<br>
In the cracking step, the sintered lump is cracked to an appropriate particle size using a cracking machine such as a roll granulator.<br>
3&gt;H<br><br>
In the case where the activator is soluble in a solvent at least after the sintering step, an appropriate solvent is contacted with the sintered lump or the cracked powder after the sintering and before, during or after the cracking or at a plurality of these steps and thereby, the activator component is dissolved and removed. In view of easiness of the removal, the activator component is preferably dissolved and removed from the cracked powder after cracking.<br>
The solvent used here is a solvent in which the activator to be dissolved has a sufficiently high solubility. A solvent which is inexpensive and hardly remains is preferred. For example, in the case of a water-soluble activator, water may be used; in the case of an organic solvent-soluble activator, an organic solvent such as methyl isobutyl ketone, ethanol or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) may be used; in the case of an acid-soluble activator, an acid solution such as nitric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, boric acid, carbonic acid, , hydrofluoric acid, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydroiodic acid or organic acid may be used; in the case of an alkali-soluble activator, an alkali solution such as hydroxide of alkali metal, hydroxide of alkaline earth metal or ammonia may be used; and in the case of an activator which forms a soluble complex, a solution of an amine such as ammonia or ethylenediamine, an amino acid such as glycine,  a polyphosphoric acid such as sodium<br>
3^-<br><br>
tripolyphosphate, a crown ether, a thiosulfate such as sodium thiosulfate, or a chelating agent such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, which becomes a ligand of the complex, may be used.<br>
A solution of an ammonium salt such as ammonium chloride, ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulfate, cation exchange resin and anion exchange resin may also be used suitably. It is preferable to dissolve and remove the activator at a lower temperature. If the activator is dissolved and removed at a high temperature, the surface of a niobium becomes oxidized because a niobium has a high affinity with oxygen. Consequently, a temperature of dissolving and removing is preferably 50°C or lower, more preferably from -10 °C to 40 °C and still more preferably from 0 °C to 30 °C. According to the above reason, it is preferable to select a method generating little heat in dissolving and removing. For example, when using a metal oxide or metal as an activator, dissolving and removing by an acid generally yields a high heat of neutralization. Therefore, it is preferable to select a method which generates little heat such as dissolving in water and an organic solvent, forming a soluble complex such by using a solvent of ammonium nitrate salt, and ethylenediaminetetraacetate and dissolving in a solvent containing ion exchange resin.<br>
Specific examples of the combination of an activator and a solvent include barium oxide and water,  calcium<br>
3^<br><br>
oxalate and hydrochloric acid, aluminum oxide and aqueous sodium hydroxide solution, hafnium oxide and methyl isobutyl ketone, and magnesium carbonate and aqueous tetrasodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate solution.<br>
After dissolving and removing the activator, the residue is thoroughly washed and dried. For example, in the case where barium oxide is removed with water, the residue is thoroughly washed using an ion-exchanged solution until the electric conductivity of the washing solution is reduced to 5 (4,S/cm or less. Subsequently, the product is dried at a product temperature of 50°C or less under reduced pressure. Here, the amount of the remaining activator or solvent component is usually 100 ppm or less, though this varies depending on the washing conditions.<br>
In order to improve the LC value, the thus-obtained niobium powder, sintered lump and niobium starting material powder may be  subjected to  nitridation,  boronization, carbonization or sulfudization of a part of the niobium powder, or to a plurality of these treatments.<br>
The niobium powder of the present invention may contain the obtained niobium nitride, niobium boride, niobium carbide or niobium sulfide or a plurality of these species. The total content of respective elements of nitrogen, boron, carbon and sulfur varies depending on the shape of the niobium powder, however, it is from 0 to 200,000 ppm, preferably 50 to 100,000 ppm, more preferably 200 to 20,000 ppm. If the total content exceeds 200,000 ppm.<br>
•3^<br><br>
the capacitor produced is deteriorated in the capacitance characteristics and not suitable as a capacitor.<br>
The nitridation of the niobium powder can be performed by any one of liquid nitridation, ion nitridation and gas nitridation or by a combination thereof. Among these, gas nitridation in a nitrogen gas atmosphere is preferred because the apparatus therefor is simple and the operation is easy. For example, the gas nitridation in a nitrogen gas atmosphere can be attained by allowing the above-described niobium powder to stand in a nitrogen gas atmosphere. With a nitridation atmosphere temperature of 2,000°C or less and a standing time of 100 hours or less, a niobium powder having an objective nitrided amount can be obtained. The treatment time can be shortened by performing the treatment at a higher temperature.<br>
The boronization of the niobium powder may be either gas boronization or solid phase boronization. For example, the niobium powder may be boronized by allowing it to stand together with a boron source such as boron pellet or boron halide (e.g., trifluoroboron), at 2,000°C or less for from 1 minute to 100 hours under reduced pressure.<br>
The carbonization of the niobium powder may be any one of gas carbonization, solid phase carbonization and liquid carbonization. For example, the niobium powder may be carbonized by allowing it to stand together with a carbon source such as carbon material or organic material having carbon (e.g., methane), at 2,000°C or less for from 1 minute<br>
3^<br><br>
to 100 hours under reduced pressure.<br>
The sulfudization of the niobium powder may be any one of gas sulfudization, ion sulfudization and solid phase sulfudization. For example, the gas sulfudization in a sulfur gas atmosphere can be attained by allowing the niobium powder to stand in a sulfur atmosphere. With a sulfudization atmosphere temperature of 2,000°C or less and a standing time of 100 hours or less, a niobium powder having an objective sulfudized amount can be obtained. The treatment time can be shortened by performing the treatment at a higher temperature.<br>
The BET specific surface area of the thus-obtained niobium powder of the present invention is usually 0.5 to 40 m^/g, preferably 0.7 to 10 m^/g, more preferably 0.9 to 2 mVg.<br>
The niobium powder of the present invention may be a mixture of niobium powders different in the tapping density, the particle size, the angle of repose, the BET specific surface area, the pore diameter distribution and the treatment by nitridation, boronization, carbonization or sulfudization.<br>
The sintered body of the present invention, which can be used as an electrode for capacitors, is preferably produced, for example, by sintering the above-described niobium powder of the present invention. For example, the sintered body can be obtained by press-molding the niobium powder into a predetermined shape and then heating it at<br>
31<br><br>
from 500°C to 2,000°C, preferably from 800°C to 1,500°C, more preferably from 1,000°C to 1,300°C, for 1 minute to 10 hours under a pressure of 10"^ to 10^ Pa.<br>
The pore size distribution of the sintered body obtained from the niobium powder of the present invention usually has a pore diameter peak top in the range of 0.01 |jm to 500 |jm.<br>
By adjusting the applied pressure at the molding to a specific pressure value, the sintered body can have a larger number of pore diameter peak tops than that of the niobium powder. This applied pressure value varies depending on the press-molding conditions such as physical properties of niobium powder, shape of a molded article and molding machine, but is in the range from a pressure capable of press-molding to a pressure where pores of the sintered body are not closed. The preferred pressure value can be determined by a preliminary experiment according to the conditions such as the physical properties of the niobium powder to be molded so as to have a plurality of pore size peak tops. The applied pressure value can be controlled, for example, by controlling the load of the molding machine applied on the molded article.<br>
The pore size distribution of the sintered body preferably has at least two pore size peak tops so as to contain pores small enough to obtain a desired capacitance and pores large enough to ensure satisfactory impregnation of a cathode agent according to the physical properties of<br>
^0<br><br>
the cathode agent. From such a sintered body having a plurality of peak tops in the pore diameter distribution, a capacitor having excellent impregnating ability of a counter electrode and a high capacitance appearance ratio can be produced.<br>
When among a plurality of pore diameter distribution peak tops, the peak tops of two peaks having a highest relative intensity are present in the range from 0.2 to 0.7 im. and in the range from 0.7 )jm to 3 jiun, respectively, preferably from 0.2 |jm to 0.7 jjm and from 0.9 |jm to 3 [om, respectively, the capacitor produced from this sintered body can have good moisture resistance. Among a plurality of the pore diameter distribution peak tops, the peak top of the peak having a highest relative intensity is preferably present in the larger diameter side than the peak top of the peak having a next highest relative intensity, because the capacitor can have more excellent moisture resistance.<br>
The specific surface area of the thus-produced sintered body is generally from 0.2 m^/g to 7 m^/g.<br>
Usually, as the shape of the sintered body is larger, the impregnation of a counter electrode is more difficult. For example, in the case where the sintered body has a size of 10 mm^ or more, the sintered body of the present invention having a plurality of peak tops in the pore diameter distribution can be particularly effectively used.<br>
The sintered body of the present invention may be<br>
Ml<br><br>
partially nitrided. As for the nitridation method, the method and reaction conditions described above with respect to the niobium powder can be employed. It is also possible to previously nitride a part of the niobium powder for use of producing a sintered body and nitride a part of the sintered body produced from this niobium powder.<br>
Such a sintered body usually contains from 500 to 70,000 mass ppm of oxygen, because natural oxidation oxygen contained in the niobium powder before the sintering and oxygen added by the natural oxidation after the sintering are present. In the sintered body of the present invention, the content of elements except for niobium, alloy-forming element, oxygen and nitrogen is usually 400 mass ppm or less.<br>
As one example, when the sintered body of the present invention is sintered at 1,300°C, the CV value (the product of the electrochemical forming voltage in the electrochemical forming at 8G°C for 120 minutes in an aqueous 0.1 mass% phosphoric acid solution and the capacitance at 120 Hz) is 40,000 to 200,000 nFV/g.<br>
The production of a capacitor device is described below.<br>
For example, a lead wire comprising a valve-acting metal such as niobium or tantalum and having appropriate shape and length is prepared and this lead wire is integrally molded at the press-molding of the niobium powder such that a part of the lead wire is inserted into<br>
^O^<br><br>
the inside of the molded article, whereby the lead wire can work out to a leading line of the sintered body. Or, the niobium powder is molded and sintered without using a lead wire and then, a lead wire separately prepared is connected thereto by welding or the like.<br>
Using this sintered body as one electrode, a capacitor can be produced by interposing a dielectric material between this electrode and a counter electrode. For example, a capacitor is fabricated by using a niobium sintered body as one electrode, forming a dielectric material on the surface of the sintered body (including the inside surface of pore) and providing a counter electrode on the dielectric material.<br>
The dielectric material used here for the capacitor is preferably a dielectric material mainly comprising niobium oxide, more preferably a dielectric material mainly comprising niobium pentaoxide. The dielectric material mainly comprising niobium pentaoxide can be obtained, for example, by electrolytically oxidizing the niobium sintered body as one electrode. For electrolytically oxidizing the niobium electrode in an electrolytic solution, an aqueous protonic acid solution is generally used, such as aqueous 0.1% phosphoric acid solution, aqueous sulfuric acid solution, aqueous 1% acetic acid solution or aqueous adipic acid solution.

When the organic or inorganic semiconductor used has an electrical conductivity of 10'^ S/cm to 10' S/cm, the capacitor produced can have a smaller impedance value and can be increased in the capacitance at a high frequency.<br>
The electrically conducting polymer layer is produced, for example, by a method of polymerizing a polymerizable compound such as aniline, thiophene, furan, pyrrole, methylpyrrole or a substitution derivative thereof under the action of an oxidizing agent capable of satisfactorily undergoing an oxidation reaction of dehydrogenative two-electron oxidation. Examples of the polymerization reaction from the polymerizable compound (monomer) include vapor phase polymerization and solution polymerization. The electrically conducting polymer layer is formed on the surface of the niobium sintered body having thereon a dielectric material. In the case where the electrically conducting polymer is an organic solvent-soluble polymer capable of solution coating, a method of coating the polymer on the surface of the sintered body to form an electrically conducting polymer layer is used.<br>
One preferred example of the production method using the solution polymerization is a method of dipping the<br>

niobium sintered body having formed thereon a dielectric layer in a solution containing an oxidizing agent (Solution 1) and subsequently dipping the sintered body in a solution containing a monomer and a dopant (Solution 2) , thereby performing the polymerization to form an electrically conducting polymer layer on the surface of the sintered body. Also, the sintered body may be dipped in Solution 1 after it is dipped in Solution 2. Solution 2 used in the above-described method may be a monomer solution not containing a dopant. In the case of using a dopant, the dopant may be allowed to be present together in the solution containing an oxidizing agent.<br>
The operation of performing these polymerization steps is repeated once or more, preferably from 3 to 20 times, per the niobium sintered body having thereon a dielectric material, whereby a dense and stratified electrically conducting polymer layer can be easily formed.<br>
In the production method of a capacitor of the present invention, any oxidizing agent may be used insofar as it does not adversely affect the capacitor performance and the reductant of the oxidizing agent can work out to a dopant and elevate the electrically conductivity of the electrically conducting polymer.

Among these oxidizing agents, preferred are oxidizing agents containing a trivalent Fe-base compound, cuprous chloride, an alkali persulfate, an ammonium persulfate or a quinone.<br>
For the anion having a dopant ability which is allowed 12to be present together, if desired, in the production of a polymer composition for the electrically conducting polymer (anion other than the reductant anion of the oxidizing agent), an electrolyte anion having as a counter anion an oxidizing agent anion (a reductant of oxidizing agent) produced from the above-described oxidizing agent, or other electrolyte anion may be used.

In the case where the counter electrode is solid, an electrically conducting layer may be provided thereon so as to attain good electrical contact with an exterior leading line (for example, lead frame) which is used, if desired.<br>
The electrically conducting layer can be formed, for example,  by  the  solidification  of  an  electrically conducting paste, the plating, the metallization or the formation of a heat-resistant electrically conducting resin film.  Preferred examples of the electrically conducting paste include silver paste, copper paste, aluminum paste, carbon paste and nickel paste,  and these may be used individually or in combination of two or more thereof.  In the case of using two or more kinds of pastes, the pastes may be mixed or may be superposed one on another as separate layers.  The electrically conducting paste applied is then solidified by allowing it to stand in air or under heating.  Examples of the plating include nickel plating, copper  plating,  silver  plating  and  aluminum  plating. Examples of the metal vapor-deposited include aluminum, nickel, copper and silver.<br>
More specifically, for example, carbon paste and silver paste are stacked in this order on the second electrode and these are molded with a material such as epoxy resin, thereby fabricating a capacitor. This capacitor may have a niobium or tantalum lead which is sintered and molded integrally with the niobium sintered<br>
S^<br><br>
body or welded afterward.<br>
The thus-fabricated capacitor of the present invention is jacketed using, for example, resin mold, resin case, metallic jacket case, dipping of resin or laminate film, and then used as a capacitor product for various uses.<br>
In the case where the counter electrode is liquid, the capacitor fabricated comprising the above-described two electrodes and a dielectric material is housed, for example, in a can electrically connected to the counter electrode to complete the capacitor. In this case, the electrode side of the niobium sintered body is guided outside through a niobium or tantalum lead described above and at the same time, insulated from the can using an insulating rubber or the like.<br>
By producing a sintered body for capacitors using the niobium powder produced according to the embodiment of the present invention described in the foregoing pages and producing a capacitor from the sintered body, a capacitor having a small leakage current and good reliability can be obtained.<br>
The capacitor of the present invention has a larger electrostatic capacitance for the volume than the conventional tantalum capacitors and therefore, a more compact capacitor product can be obtained.<br>
The capacitor of the present invention having such properties can be applied to uses, for example, as a by¬pass capacitor or a coupling capacitor which are frequently<br>
D&gt;<br><br>
used in an analogue circuit and a digital circuit, and also to uses of conventional tantalum capacitors.<br>
In general, such a capacitor is frequently used in an electronic circuit and when the capacitor of the present invention is used, the limitation in the arrangement of electronic parts or the discharge of heat can be relieved, as a result, an electronic circuit having high reliability can be disposed in a narrower space than that necessary for conventional electronic circuits.<br>
Furthermore, when the capacitor of the present invention is used, an electronic instrument having smaller size and higher reliability than conventional ones can be obtained, such as a computer, computer peripheral equipment (e.g., a PC card), mobile equipment (e.g., a portable telephone), home appliance, equipment mounted on vehicles, artificial satellite and communication equipment.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is described in detail below by referring to Examples and Comparative Examples, however, the present invention is not limited to these Examples.<br>
In each Example, the tapping density, the angle of repose, the particle size and the pore diameter of the niobium powder and the capacitance, leakage current, capacitance appearance ratio, moisture resistance of the capacitor and ESR value of the capacitor were measured by the following methods.<br>
5h<br><br>
(1)	Measurement of Tapping Density<br>
The tapping density was measured in accordance with<br>
the  Method  by  Tapping  Apparatus  and  the  Measuring<br>
Instrument  in  the Apparent  Specific  Gravity Measuring<br>
Method of Industrial Sodium Carbonate specified in JIS<br>
(Japanese Industrial Standard, Edition of 2000) K1201-1.<br>
(2)	Measurement of Angle of Repose<br>
The angle of repose was measured using the flowability measuring instrument and the sample amount specified in JIS (Japanese Industrial Standard, Edition of 2000) Z2504. More specifically, niobium powder was dropped on a horizontal plane from the hopper whose lower end was at a height of 6 cm above the horizontal plane and the angle of the slant face from the apex of the circular cone generated to the horizontal plane was designated as the angle of repose.<br>
(3)	Measurement of Particle Size<br>
Using an apparatus manufactured by Microtrack (HRA 9320-XlOO), the particle size distribution was measured by the laser diffraction scattering method. A particle size value (D50; pm) when the accumulated volume % corresponded to 50 volume % was designated as the average particle size. (4) Measurement of Pore Diameter<br>
Using Poresizer 9320 manufactured by Micromeritics, the pore size distribution was measured by the mercury porosimetry method.<br>
In the present invention, the maximal value was determined from the rate of change in the press-fitted<br>
sT<br><br>
amount and by defining the pore diameter shown by the maximal value as the peak top, the maximal value was used as the size of relative intensity of the peak to which this peak top belongs.<br>
(5)	Measurement of Capacitance of Capacitor<br>
The LCR meter manufactured by Hewlett-Packard was connected between terminals of the produced chip at room temperature and the measured capacitance at 120 Hz was defined as the capacitance of the capacitor processed into a chip.<br>
(6)	Measurement of Leakage Current of Capacitor<br>
The current value measured after a d.c. voltage of 6.3 V was continuously applied between terminals of the produced chip for 1 minute at room temperature was defined as the leakage current value of the capacitor processed into a chip.<br>
(7)	Capacitance Appearance Ratio of Capacitor<br>
Assuming that the capacitance when a sintered body electrochemically formed in an aqueous 0.1% phosphoric acid solution for 1,000 minutes under the conditions of 80°C and 20 V was measured in 30% sulfuric acid was 100%, the capacitance appearance ratio was expressed by the ratio to the capacitance after a capacitor was produced.<br>
(8)	Moisture Resistance Value of Capacitor<br>
The moisture resistance value was expressed by the number of units where the capacitance after the produced capacitor was left standing at 60°C and 95% RH for 500 hours<br>
5b<br><br>
was less than 110% or less than 120% of the initial value. As the number of units of less than 110% is larger, the moisture resistance value was judged better. (9) Measurement of ESR Value of Capacitor<br>
The LCR meter manufactured by Hewlett-Packard was connected between terminals of the produced chip at room temperature and the measured ESR value at 100 kHz, 1.5 VDC and 0.5 Vrms was defined as the ESR value of the capacitor.<br>
Example 1:<br>
Into a nickel-made crucible, 5,000 g of potassium fluoroniobate thoroughly vacuum-dried at 80°C and sodium in a molar amount of 10 times the potassium fluoroniobate were charged and allowed to undertake a reduction reaction at 1,000°C for 20 hours under an argon atmosphere. After the completion of reaction, the reduction product was cooled, washed with water, washed with 95% sulfuric acid and then with water in sequence, vacuum-dried and pulverized for 40 hours using a ball mill of alumina pot containing silica alumina balls. The pulverized product was dipped and stirred in a 3:2 (by mass) mixed solution of 50% nitric acid and 10% aqueous hydrogen peroxide. Thereafter, the pulverized product was thoroughly washed with water until the pH reached 7 to remove impurities, and then vacuum-dried. The starting material niobium powder had an average particle size of 1.2 jam.<br>
In a niobium-made pot, 500 g of this starting material<br>
S&gt;<br><br>
niobium powder was placed and thereto, 50 g of butyl polymethylmethacrylate and 1 liter of toluene were added. Furthermore, zirconia balls were added and the contents were mixed for 1 hour using a shaking mixer. After removing zirconia balls, the mixture was placed in a conical drier and vacuum-dried under the conditions of 1x10^ Pa and 80°C.<br>
Subsequently, this niobium powder was heated under 1x10"^ Pa at 250 to 400°C for 12 hours to decompose and remove butyl polymethylmethacrylate, and then sintered under reduced pressure of 4x10"^ Pa at 1,150'C for 2 hours. The niobium sintered lump was cooled until the product temperature was lowered to 30°C or lower, and then cracked using a roll granulator to obtain a niobium cracked powder having an average particle size of 100 \xm.<br>
This niobium cracked powder was subjected to a nitridation treatment at 300°C for 2 hours by passing nitrogen therethrough under pressure and about 450 g of niobium powder was obtained. The nitrogen content was 0.22%.<br>
The physical properties of this niobium powder, such as tapping density, average particle size, angle of repose, BET specific surface area and pore diameter peak top are shown in Table 1.<br>
The thus-obtained niobium powder (about 0.1 g) was charged into the hopper of a tantalum device automatic molding machine (TAP-2R, manufactured by Seiken) and automatically molded together with a 0.3 mmcj) niobium wire to  manufacture  a  molded  article  having  a  size  of<br>
f^<br><br>
approximately 0,3 cm x 0.18 cm x 0.45 cm. The outer appearance and the dispersion in the mass of the molded article are shown in Table 1.<br>
This molded article was left standing in a vacuum of 4x10"^ Pa at 1,250°C for 30 minutes to obtain a sintered body. 100 Units of this sintered body were prepared and each was electrochemically formed using an aqueous 0,1% phosphoric acid solution at a voltage of 20 V for 200 minutes to form an oxide dielectric film on the surface.<br>
Subsequently, an operation of dipping the sintered body in an aqueous 60% manganese nitrate solution and then heating it at 220°C for 30 minutes was repeated to form a manganese dioxide layer as the counter electrode layer on the oxide dielectric film. On this counter electrode layer, a carbon layer and a silver paste layer were stacked in this order. After mounting a lead frame thereon, the device as a whole was molded with an epoxy resin to manufacture a chip-type capacitor. The capacitance appearance ratio of the capacitor, and the average capacitance and the average leakage current (hereinafter simply referred to as "LC") of the chip-type capacitors (n=100 units) are shown in Table 1. The LC value is a value measured at room temperature by applying a voltage of 6.3 V for 1 minute. Example 2:<br>
In an SUS 304-made reactor, 1,000 g of a niobium ingot was placed and thereinto, hydrogen was continuously introduced at 400°C for 10 hours.   After cooling,  the<br>
^1<br><br>
hydrogenated niobium lump was placed in an SUS 304-made pot containing zirconia balls and pulverized for 10 hours. Thereafter, this hydride was formed into a 20 vol% slurry with water, charged together with zirconia balls into a spike mill and wet-pulverized at 40°C or lower for 7 hours to obtain a pulverized slurry of niobium hydride! This starting material niobium hydride powder had an average particle size of 0.9 jjm.<br>
In an SUS-made pot, this slurry (slurry concentration of 98 %) was charged and thereto, 200 g of barium oxide having an, average particle size of 1 |jin was added. Furthermore, zirconia balls were added and the contents were mixed for 1 hour using a shaking mixer. After removing zirconia balls, the mixture was placed in a niobium-made vat and vacuum-dried under the conditions of 1x10^ Pa and 50°C.<br>
Subsequently, the obtained mixture was heated under 1x10"^ Pa at 400'C for 4 hours to dehydrogenate the niobium hydride, and then sintered under reduced pressure of 4x10""' Pa at 1,1'00°C for 2 hours. The resulting barium oxide-mixed niobium sintered lump was cooled until the product temperature was lowered to 30°C or lower, and then cracked using a roll granulator to obtain a barium oxide-mixed niobium cracked powder having an average particle size of 95 jam.<br>
Into a polytetrafluoroethylene container, 500 g of this barium oxide-mixed niobium cracked powder and 1,000 g<br>

Separately, an aqueous solution obtained by mixing 600 g of 60% nitric acid, 150 g of 30% hydrogen peroxide and 750 g of ion-exchanged water and cooled to 15°C or lower was prepared. Then, 500 g of this aqueous solution was added dropwise with stirring to an aqueous solution having suspended therein the barium oxide-mixed niobium cracked powder while taking care not to allow the water temperature to exceed 20°C. After the completion of dropwise addition, the solution was continuously stirred for another 1 hour, left standing for 30 minutes and then decanted. Thereto, 2,000 g of ion-exchanged water was added and the resulting solution was stirred for 30 minutes, left standing for 30 minutes and then decanted. This operation was repeated 5 times. Thereafter, the niobium cracked powder was charged into a Teflon-made column and washed with water for 4 hours while flowing ion-exchanged water. At this time, the electrical conductivity of the washing water was 0.9 |aS/cm.<br>
After the completion of water washing, the niobium cracked powder was dried at 50°C under reduced pressure and subjected to a nitridation treatment at 300°C for 3 hours by passing nitrogen therethrough under pressure, as a result, about 350 g of niobium powder was obtained. The nitrogen content was 0.28%.<br>
