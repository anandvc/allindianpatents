Floor Lock<br>
The invention relates to a locking device for a swinging/sliding door, in particular for vehicles, which interacts with a guide rail arranged on the door leaf of the swinging/sliding door, along the bottom horizontal edge thereof, which is provided in the floor region, in the region of the secondary closing edge, and which can be actuated by a door drive.<br>
Swinging/sliding doors, as are often used in particular in vehicles, for example in railroad cars or subway cars, are usually guided, and connected to the door drive, in the region of their top horizontal edge. The bottom door region is usually guided via guide rollers or guide rails or the like in order to prevent the door leaf from striking against the doorway or from rattling in the open state. There is then the problem of having to provide a closure means along the bottom peripheral region of the door leaf, in the region of the secondary closing edge, in the closed state, in order that reliable closure and sealing of the door is also ensured in this region. There are essentially two possible ways of providing for this in the prior art:<br>
The first possibility provides a type of rotary lever or hook which, once the door has reached the final closed position, is rotated such that it presses onto a latching surface of the door leaf in the closing direction and fixes the position of the door leaf in this way.<br>
In the case of the second possibility, the guidance of the door leaf in the region of its bottom horizontal edge is used in order for the guide means interacting with the guide, at the end of the closing movement, to be moved in the direction normal to the door-leaf plane (or more or less normal to the door-leaf plane) and<br><br>
WO 2006/029856	- 2 - PCT/EP2005/009919<br>
thus for the correct final closed position to be ensured.<br>
The first variant has the disadvantage of requiring additional elements which have to be accommodated in the doorway. It thus involves high outlay and requires a considerable amount of space, and it is also the case that special allowances have to be made for it in the door-control means.<br>
The second variant is easier to manage from the point of view of the control means, but the amount of space which it requires is precisely where the door users will be particularly aware of the space available, namely in the inside width of the doorway.<br>
The object of the invention is to improve a device of the second type mentioned such that the amount of space required is reduced and that it is possible to have configurations in which the guide rail arranged on the door leaf may be of shorter design than has been the case hitherto, all this being done without increasing the costs or the installation outlay.<br>
This object is achieved according to the invention by a four-bar mechanism, preferably a parallelogram, which is formed by an essentially horizontally arranged coupling member and levers arranged in an articulated manner thereon, one of the levers containing a guide slot into which projects a locking bolt, which can be moved in the guide slot by an actuating element actuated by the door drive. This makes it possible for the rotary movement which, up until now, ran in a horizontal plane and essentially transversely to the width of the doorway, and thus required a considerable amount of space in this direction, to be changed into a rotary movement about horizontally, or essentially<br><br>
WO 2006/029856	- 3 - PCT/EP2005/009919<br>
horizontally, running axes and for the components involved to be formed as flat structures, which thus have considerably reduced dimensions in the direction of the width of the doorway.<br>
One configuration is characterized in that the locking bolt, projecting into the guide slot, is arranged on a locking lever, which can be pivoted about an essentially horizontal axis, and the actuating element acts on the locking lever, preferably in the region of the bolt. This allows precise guidance of the locking bolt and of the actuating element using just one component, which cuts back on space and costs.<br>
A development provides that the coupling member has arranged on it a pivoting lever which can be pivoted about an essentially vertical axis and, at its free end, bears a guide roller which interacts with the guide. It is thus possible for the guide roller to be located within the width of the doorway when the door leaf is in the closed position, but right up against the periphery of the doorway, or slightly outside the width of the doorway, in the open position. As a result, the guide rail on the door leaf may be configured to be considerably shorter than the door leaf in this direction (width).<br>
The invention is explained in more detail hereinbelow<br>
with reference with the drawing, in which:<br>
figure 1 shows a view in the horizontal direction<br>
parallel to the door-leaf plane,<br>
figure 2 shows a schematic plan view in the direction<br>
of the arrow II from figure 1,<br>
figure 3 shows a schematic view in the direction of the<br>
arrow III from figure 1, each of these figures<br>
illustrating the device in the closed and locked<br>
position, and<br><br>
WO 2006/029856	- 4 - PCT/EP2005/009919<br>
figures 4 and 5 show views analogous to the views of figures 1 and 2, but in the open position of the device.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates a schematic view of a retaining and locking mechanism according to the invention as seen in the direction of the arrow I from figure 2, usually running in the direction of the longitudinal axis of the vehicle. The retaining device, which is designated as a whole by 11, is installed in a car body or door frame 10 in a state in which it has been fastened on an installation plate 12. Two levers 2 and 3, connected by a coupling member 1, are mounted on the installation plate 12 in the manner of a four-bar mechanism, in the exemplary embodiment illustrated in the manner of a parallelogram. A pivoting lever 7 is mounted on the coupling member 1 such that it can be pivoted about an essentially vertically running axis 15. At its end region which is directed toward the doorway opening and a door leaf 13, the pivoting lever bears a guide roller 8, which interacts with a guide rail 9 of the door leaf 13.<br>
One of the two levers 2 and 3, in the exemplary embodiment illustrated the lever 2, has a guide slot 14 into which projects a locking bolt 4, which is fastened on a locking lever 5 arranged in a pivotable manner on the installation plate 12. An actuating element 6 acts on the locking lever 5, directly on the locking bolt 4 as seen in the exemplary embodiment illustrated, the actuating element leading upward along the secondary closing edge of the vehicle and being actuated there by the door drive (not illustrated).<br>
This device, then, functions as follows: if, starting from the position of the individual constituent parts which is illustrated in figure 1, the actuating element<br><br>
WO 2006/029856	- 5 - PCT/EP2005/009919<br>
6 is raised, it pivots the locking lever 5, and thus the locking bolt 4, upward along a circular path about the point of articulation of the locking lever 5. This movement gives rise to the displacement of the locking bolt 4 in the guide slot 14, which moves the coupling member 1 to the left (in figure 1) by virtue of the two levers 2, 3 being pivoted, until the end position which is illustrated in figure 4 is reached. The coupling member 1, and thus ultimately also the guide roller 8, here executes a slight vertical movement, although this is of no consequence for the reliability and quality of guidance in the guide rail 9.<br>
During the opening movement of the door, the pivoting lever 7 also moves about its axis 15, as can clearly be seen from comparing figures 2 and 5: from the closed position, illustrated in figure 2, in which the pivoting lever 7 is directed into the interior of the width of the doorway, it pivots, for its part being carried along by the guide rail 9 of the opening door, in a direction in which it is pivoted out of the width of the doorway, as can be seen from figure 5. As a result, the length of the guide rail 9 on the door leaf<br>
13	may be considerably smaller than the length of the<br>
opening movement of the door leaf 13, and furthermore,<br>
or in combination therewith, the doorway width, when<br>
the door is open, is kept free of retaining and guiding<br>
parts of the door mechanism to a greater extent than<br>
was possible in the prior art.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment illustrated, the guide slot<br>
14	has the special feature of being in the form of a<br>
circle arc in the portion in which the locking bolt 4<br>
ends up being located when the door is in the closed<br>
position (figure 1), the center point of the circle arc<br>
coinciding with the pivot axis of the locking lever 5.<br>
This forms a dead region in the cinematics. This means<br><br>
WO 2006/029856	- 6 - PCT/EP2005/009919<br>
that forces which act on the coupling member 1, and thus on the lever 2, in the opening direction via the door leaf 13, the guide rail 9, the guide roller 8, the pivoting lever 7 and the mounting thereof, are not capable of subjecting the locking lever 5 to a moment in the opening direction. This locking means thus remains resistant to unintentional or malicious attempts to open the door in an unauthorized manner by shaking the door leaf 13.<br>
This could also be achieved by a so-called over-dead-center mechanism, in which case the shaping of the guide slot 14 in this region would have to be such that an opening movement on the door leaf 13 results in the locking lever 5 being pushed further in the locking direction. However, such previously known over-dead-center mechanisms have the disadvantage that, in the absence of the customary door drive, when the door is being forced by the users, and then opened by the emergency opening device, the locking lever 5 has to be rotated out of its end region counter to the locking torque exerted by the passengers, which, in particular in situations which are unusual, unpleasant or dangerous, is difficult, for passengers without training.<br>
In comparison with this, in the case of a slot guide with a dead region like that illustrated, the forces which occur on the door leaf 13 (with the exception of a negligible increase in the friction in the bearing of the locking lever 5) have no effect on the force which is required for opening the locking means.<br>
It is clear from looking at figure 4 that, in that position of the device which corresponds to the door being open, that region of the guide slot 14 in which the locking bolt 4 is located runs essentially in the<br><br>
WO 2006/029856	- 7 - PCT/EP2005/009919<br>
direction in which the actuating element 6 is moved (arrow II in figure 1 and oppositely directed arrow in figure 4) . As a result it is not necessary for the actuating element, or the displacement thereof, to be adjusted precisely since further movement of the actuating element 6 in the upward direction is no longer accompanied by any marked pivoting of the lever 2, or therefore by any marked change in the guide roller 8.<br>
As can be seen from figures 2 and 5, by virtue of metal plates which run essentially parallel to one another being used, the device according to the invention may be of very flat design, it is easy to install in the doorway region and can be fitted at a distance from the floor itself, so that the risk of it becoming clogged with dirt or iced up is low.<br>
The emergency release device which is necessary for most doors of this type is particularly straightforward to realize here since, in the case of the door drive being moved manually, it automatically carries along the actuating element 6 in the region above the doorway, and no special measures need therefore be taken.<br><br>
