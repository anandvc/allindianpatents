Polymeric material<br>
Description<br>
The present invention relates to a polymeric material (I) comprising<br>
a)	a polymer (II) having amide groups recurring in the polymer main chain and<br>
b)	from 0.01 to 5% by weight, based on this polymer, of a titanium dioxide (III) having a median particle size dso of up to 150 nm,<br>
and also fibers, sheet materials and moldings comprising such a polymeric material.<br>
The use of polyamides for producing fibers and yarns is common knowledge, for example from Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 5th Ed., Vol. AlO, VCH Verlagsgesellschaft mbH, Weinheim, Germany, 1987, pages 567-579.<br>
Yarn is produced in a conventional manner by melting the polyamide, spinning.the polyamide into a fiber, stretching and texturing this fiber with or without an aftertreatment of the fiber.<br>
In the case of carpet fiber, this may be followed by cabling and heat setting of the yarn. Setting processes are known per se. An essential step of a setting process is to direct the yarn through a conditioning chamber under defined process conditions, such as yarn residence time and also elevated temperature in the range from 170 to 200°C and relative humidity of the atmosphere in the conditioning chamber.<br>
In the case of textile fiber, this is often heat set on a tenter before dyeing after processing into fabrics. This heat setting serves to enhance the dimensional stability of the fabric in the course of the subsequent dyeing and further processing and to control edge curl. Fabrics are exposed to a temperature of from 170 to 200°C in the course of heat setting.<br>
The disadvantage of these heat setting operations is that polyamide quality, as evidenced by a reduction in the viscosity or in the amino end group ("AEG") content, deteriorates substantially in the course of this setting. The reduced AEG is<br><br>
evidence of polymer damage. For example, when the polymer is to be dyed, especially in the form of a fabric, the reduced AEG leads to a reduced depth of dyeing and a reduced uniformity of dyeing, for example to barriness.<br>
To reduce this damage, it is known to physically admix the polymer with stabilizers. This has the disadvantage that the stabilizers may wash off or evaporate out of the polymer again in the course of heat setting, dyeing or later use of the products produced from the polymers.<br>
To solve this problem, it has been proposed in WO 95/28443, DE-A-195 37 614, WO 97/05189 and US-A-5,851,238 for example to chemically bond a stabilizer, especially a sterically hindered piperidine derivative, to the polymer main chain.<br>
Despite this disclosure, there is a need for a further improvement in the stabilization of polyamides.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a polymeric material from which it is possible to produce fibers, sheet materials and moldings having improved heat stabilization, as measured by a reduced reduction in the viscosity, the amino end group (AEG) content, the depth of dyeing and the uniformity of dyeing.<br>
We have found that this object is achieved by the polymeric materials defined at the beginning and by fibers, sheet materials and moldings comprising such polymeric materials.<br>
According to the invention, the polymeric material (I) comprises a polymer (II) having amide groups recurring in the polymer main chain.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention, a polymer (II) is a polymer having amide groups recurring in the polymer main chain or a mixture of various polymers having amide groups recurring in the polymer main chain.<br>
As well as polymer (II), the polymeric material (I) may comprise further polymers which are not polymers (II). In an advantageous embodiment, the polymer in polymeric material (I) is exclusively polymer (II).<br><br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment, the polymeric material<br>
(I)	contains as polymer (II) exclusively a polymer having amide<br>
groups recurring in the polymer main chain.<br>
In another particularly preferred embodiment, the polymeric material (I) contains as polymer (II) a mixture of plural, such ■ as 2, 3, 4 or 5, polymers having amide groups recurring in the polymer main chain. Such polymers (II) may also contain more than 5 polymers having amide groups recurring in the polymer main chain. But it has hitherto proved economically more advantageous to limit the number in polymer (II) of polymers having amide groups recurring in the polymer main chain; more particularly, 2 or 3 have proved particularly advantageous.<br>
Polymer (II), as well as amide groups recurring in the polymer main chain, may contain other functional groups, especially such functional groups and to such an extent that the effect of the present invention is not adversely af feeted. Advantageous other functional groups include ether, amino, keto, sulfide, sulfone, imide, ester, carbonate or urethane groups, especially ethers and esters.<br>
In an advantageous embodiment, the polymer main chain of polymer<br>
(II)	contains no functional groups other than the amide group.<br>
Polymers having amide groups recurring in the polymer main chain are customarily known as polyamides.<br>
Polyamides are herein to be understood as being homopolymers, copolymers, blends and grafts of synthetic long-chain polyamides having recurring amide groups in the polymer main chain as an essential constituent. Examples of such polyamides are nylon 6 (polycaprolactam) , nylon 6,6 (polyhexamethyleneadipamide), nylon 4,6 (polytetramethyleneadipamide), nylon 6,10 (polyhexamethylene-sebacamide), nylon 6,12 (polyhexamethylene-1, 10-decanedicarboxamide), nylon 7 (polyenantholactam), nylon 11 (polyundecanolactam), nylon 12 (polydodecanolactam). As well as polyamides known by the generic name of nylon, polyamides further include the aramids (aromatic polyamides), such as poly-meta-phenyleneisophthalamide (NOMEX® fiber, US-A-3 , 287 , 324) or poly-para-phenyleneterephthalamide (KEVLAR® fiber, US-A-3,671,542).<br>
Polyamides can in principle be prepared by two methods.<br><br>
In a polymerization from dicarboxylic acids and diamines and also in a polymerization from amino acids or their derivatives, such as aminocarbonitriles, aminocarboxamides, aminocarboxylate esters or aminocarboxylate salts, the amino and carboxyl end groups of the starting monomers or starting oligomers react with one another to form an amide group and water. The water can subsequently be removed from the polymer. In a polymerization from carboxamides, the amino and amide end groups of the starting monomers or starting oligomers react with one another to form an amide group and ammonia. The ammonia can subsequently be removed from the polymer. This polymerization reaction is customarily known as a polycondensation.<br>
A polymerization from lactams as starting monomers or starting oligomers is customarily known as a polyaddition.<br>
Polymers having amide groups recurring in the polymer main chain can be prepared using monomers selected from the group consisting of lactams, omega-aminocarboxylic acids, omega-aminocarbonitriles, omega-aminocarboxamides, omega-aminocarboxylate salts, omega-aminocarboxylate esters, equimolar mixtures of diamines and dicarboxylic acids, dicarboxylic acid/diamine salts, dinitriles and diamines or mixtures thereof.<br>

The pigments may preferably be present in polymer (II) in an amount of at least 0.01 part by weight, especially at least 0.02 part by weight, in either case based on 100 parts by weight of polymer (II).<br>
It may be advantageous to add the pigments in the course of the production of the polymer.<br>
It may be preferable to prepare polymers (II) by customary proCesses.<br>
For instanCe, the polymerization of caprolactam monomer to prepare nylon 6 may be effected for example according to the continuous or batch proCesses described in DE-A 14 95 198, DE-A 25 58 480, DE-A 44 13 177, Polymerization ProCesses, InterscienCe, New York, 1977, pages 424-467 and Handbuch der<br><br>
Technischen Polymerchemie, VCH Verlagsgesellschaft, Weinheim, 1993, pages 546-554.<br>
It is advantageous to prepare polycaprolactam by adding titanium dioxide (III) as a suspension or as a pigment conCentrate in polycaprolactam, preferably at pigment contents in the range from 1 to 90% by weight and particularly preferably in the range from 10 to 50% by weight, especially in the range from 20 to 35% by weight, based on the total weight of the pigment conCentrate, to the monomer, i.e., to the caprolactam, or during the polymerization to the oligomer in one or more stages.<br>
The polymerization of 66 salt monomer to prepare nylon 66 can be effected according to the customary batch proCess (see: Polymerization ProCesses, InterscienCe, New York, 1977, pages 424-467, especially 444-446) or according to a continuous proCess, for example as described in EP-A 129 196.<br>
It is advantageous to prepare poly(hexamethylene diammonium adipate) by adding titanium dioxide (III) as a suspension advantageously in water, preferably at pigment contents in the range from 1 to 90% by weight, particularly preferably in the range from 10 to 50% by weight and especially in the range from 20 to 35% by weight, based on the total weight of the pigment conCentrate, in one or more stages, preferably during the precondensation phase. It may be similarly advantageous to add it as a pigment conCentrate in monomers suitable for preparing polymer (I) such as caprolactam, in a polymer (I), such as nylon 6 or nylon 66, preferably at pigment contents in the range from 1 to 90% by weight, particularly preferably in the range from 10 to 50% by weight and especially in the range from 20 to 35% by weight, based on the total weight of the pigment conCentrate, in one or more stages, preferably during the precondensation phase.<br>
The preparation of the aforementioned pigment conCentrates and suspensions containing titaniiom dioxide (III) is known per se, for example from DE-A-100 04 461 or WO 00/14165.<br>
The polymeric materials (I) according to the invention are very useful for producing f ilciments, fibers, films, fabriC8 and moldings. Of particular advantage are filaments obtained from polyamides, especially polycaprolactam, by high speed spinning at spinning speeds of at least 2000 m/min and preferably at least 4000 m/min. The filaments, fibers, films, fabriC8 and moldings obtained using the polyamides of the invention are useful for<br><br>
many applications, for example as textile clothing or carpet fibers,<br>
Examples<br>
The AEG content was determined as an acidometric titration. The amino end groups were titrated with perchloric acid in a 70:30 w/w solution in phenol/methanol.<br>
The relative viscosity of the polymeric materials was determined in 1% solution (1 g/100 ml) in conCentrated sulfuric acid (96% by weight) at 25°C in accordanCe with DIN 51562-1 to -4 as at January 1999.<br>
The heat stability of the polyamide filaments was determined under conditions which correspond to those of heat setting proCesses in subsequent treatment stages, for example heat setting of BCF (bulked continuous filament) or tenter setting of textile fabriC8. 5 g shanks of the drawn filaments were rapidly introduCed on a holder together with the comparative samples into a through circulation oven preheated to 185°C and left therein for 120 seconds from reattainment of the air temperature measured in direct sample vicinity. The sample was then immediately removed and cooled down in air at 20°C room temperature. Filaments to be compared were treated together.<br>
The damage incurred (compared with an untreated sample of the same filament) was determined as a change in the relative viscosity (RV) and in the AEG content. A smaller - positive as well as negative - change in the two values indicates less damage.<br>
Depth of dyeing and uniformity of dyeing were evaluated by knitting the yarns to be investigated up into socks, which were heat set and subsequently competitively dyed.<br>
The fabriC8 were heat set at 185°C for 120 seconds. The knit was then prewashed with Nekanil LN, Trilon TA and aCetic acid and dyed in hot water (98°C) with a mixture of 2% of Intrazone Red G (190%), 2% of Intracid Rhodamine B, 2% of ammonium sulfate and 1% of Uniperol W at pH 3.5.<br>
A black dyeing was carried out at pH 7 with 1% of Uniperol ® AC and 0.3% of Acidol Black MSRL ® dye following pretreatment with Kiralon ® MFB, Lufibrol ® MSD and sodium carbonate.<br><br>
The depth of shade was then automatically determined using a Color-flash instrument. The change in the depth of shade was determined as follows:<br>
Change in depth of shade =<br>
Depth of shade of inventive example (after heat setting) [%] -Depth of shade of comparative example (after heat setting)<br>
Depth of shade of inventive example (before heat setting) [%] Depth of shade of comparative example (before heat setting)<br>
The greater the increase in the depth of shade in relation to the comparative example, the better the depth of shade.<br>
Uniformity of dyeing was assessed by inspection. The dyed samples were independently rated by five people on the scale of:<br>
1 = not barry to  6 = very barry.<br>
The mean value of the assessments is reported.<br>
Preparation of polymers<br>
a) Batch preparation of nylon 6<br>
The starting compounds (caprolactam, water, chain regulator, piperidine derivative, Hombitec S 120 (from Sachtleben Chemie GmbH), pigment conCentrate PCI (from BASF Aktiengesellschaft) were heated to 260°C in a 360 1 vessel over 2 hours. After depressurization (over 90 min), the batch was supplementarily condensed for 45 minutes and then discharged under a small nitrogen overpressure. The polyamide obtained was subsequently pelletized, extracted with hot water and tumble dried under nitrogen.<br>
I b) Batch preparation of nylon 66<br>
60% by weight solution of 66 salt, chain regulator, piperidine derivative were precondensed at 160°C and atmospheric pressure for 15 minutes. This was followed by the addition of titanium dioxide    (III) in the form of a 28% by weight aqueous suspension (Hombitec S 120 A from Sachtleben Chemie GmbH) and/or of a customary delustering titanium dioxide in the form of a 30% by weight<br><br>
aqueous suspension. This was followed by full condensation at a pressure of 18 bar and a temperature of 275°C for 90 minutes, at which point the reactor was depressurized and the polymer discharged under nitrogen and pelletized.<br>
c) Spinning<br>
The polymers were spun on a spinning range at 265°C (nylon 6) or 295°C (nylon 66) by the H4S proCess using a winding speed of 5040 m/min per 44 dtex 12 filament yarn of round cross section. The throughput was 22 g/min per hole. The takeoff speed was 4300 m/min (duo 1), the draw ratio was 1 : 1.28 (duo 2 = 5500 m/min) and the yarn tension upstream of the winder was in the range from 3 to 6 cN. The steam box was operated with 3 bar steam.<br>
The properties of the polyamides are summarized below in tables 1 and 2. The weight perCentages are each based on total polymer weight.<br>
The polyamides of the invention exhibit a smaller decrease in the relative viscosity and in the AEG content, a higher uniformity of dyeing and a deeper depth of shade especially after heat setting than the comparative polyamides.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
