TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present disclosure relates to laminate board that is resistant to water absorption rupture abrasion, steam, cracks, cigarette burns and stains and the process of preparing the laminate board.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Particle boards are panel-like products made by bonding wooden materials with an adhesive. Most of such particle boards have a three layer construction consisting mainly of a core layer and two face layers formed on both, front and back, sides of the core layer. The core layer comprises relatively large sized wooden materials hence creating visually recognizable voids. On the contrary, the face layers comprise relatively small sized wooden materials hence being close structure. Such particle boards are made by supplying wooden materials with a spray of a urethane adhesive, forming, and pressurizing them with heating. As the particle board is poor in the function of resistance to water, its water-content gradient may cause deflections and dimensional changes of its structure or its water remaining may result in the development of mold and the decomposition of wooden constituents. Products coated with thermosetting laminates are frequent today. They are foremost used where the demand for abrasion resistance is high, but also where resistance towards different chemicals and moisture is required. As an example of such products floors, floor headings, table tops, work tops and wall panels can be mentioned. The laminated particle boards most often consists of a carrying base with a decor sheet and one or more wear layers placed closest to the surface. The decor sheet can be provided with a desired decor or pattern. The most frequent patterns usually represent the image of different kinds of wood  or minerals such as marble or granite. The most common way of achieving a laminated particle board is by first manufacturing the thermosetting laminate of a number of paper layers impregnated with melamine formaldehyde resin and then to glue this thermosetting laminate onto a core for example fibre board or particle board. It is<br><br>
also known to feed a few melamine formaldehyde impregnated paper webs together with sheets of particle or fibre board through a continuous laminate press.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
The present disclosure provides a laminate board comprising Phenol Formaldehyde (PF) coated core board; at least one Barrier layer impregnated with Melamine Formaldehyde (MF) resin or Urea Formaldehyde (UF) resin placed on either side of the core board; at least one Abrasion resistant layers impregnated with MF resin or UF resin placed on either side of the Barrier layer. The three layers are inter-linked to each other for good bonding and developing resistance to factors such as swelling in water/ water absorption, rupture, abrasion, steam, crack, cigarette burn and stain. The thickness of the PF coated core board is 0.10mm, the thickness of the barrier layer impregnated with MF resin or UF resin is 0.10mm, and the thickness of the abrasion resistant layer impregnated with M.F Resin or UF resin is 0.15mm.<br>
The present disclosure provides a laminate board that has accurate matching. The term accurate matching refers to alignment of different layers of the laminate as mentioned above without any deviation. The laminate board of the present disclosure surprisingly has accurate matching due to the compatibility between the different layers of the laminate board that is a rush of impregnation with PF resin and MF resin or UF resin. Therefore, the present disclosure provides solution to the problems of deviation in different layers when the layers are subjected to lamination leading to distorted laminate boards.<br>
The present disclosure provides a laminate board using cement bonded particle board technique. The present disclosure provides a process of preparation of said laminate board comprising sanding said core board, filling dents if any of the core board with cement paste and coating the core board with a phenol-formaldehyde resin; placing at least one barrier layer above said core board and at<br><br>
least one barrier layer below said core board, wherein said barrier layer is impregnated with a meiamine formaldehyde resin or a urea formaldehyde resin; and placing at least one abrasion resistant layer over outer surface of said barrier layers, wherein said abrasion resistant layer is impregnated with a meiamine formaldehyde resin or a urea formaldehyde resin; assembling said core board, said barrier layers and said abrasion resistant layers to obtain a book system; subjecting said book system to a suitable specific pressure and suitable temperate for suitable time followed by cooling and trimming undesired edges of said book system to obtain said laminate board.<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
The following examples are put forth so as to provide those of ordinary skill in the art with a complete disclosure and the description to make and use the present invention, and are not intended to limit the scope of what the inventors regard as their invention nor are they intended to represent that the experiments below are all and only experiments performed.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
PREPARATION OF LAMINATE BOARD 1. Preparation of pre-laminate board A. Selection of core/plain boards<br>
The plain board which herein is exemplified by cement bonded pre-laminated particle board was selected at random. The selected boards were tested as specified in I.S 2380 for requirements such as length, width, thickness, edge<br><br>
straightness and squareness. I.S 2380 refers to standard methods of test for Wood Particle Boards and Boards from other lignocellulosic materials.<br>
The plain board must be 1.0 to 2.0 mm thickness more than the desired laminate board. That means the sanding allowance must be given 1.0 to 2.0mm to get the uniform surface without any unsanding patches. After selecting the proper boards for sanding, the boards were kept in a lot form (not more than one Clamp at a time i.e. 960mm ht) and placed on the stacking table.<br>
B. Sanding<br>
Two different operations were employed for sanding, namely,<br>
1)	Rough operation with 50/60 Grit Sanding belts of size 1350mm X 2800mm.<br>
2)	Fine operation with 100/120 Grit Sanding belts of size 1350mmX 2800mm.<br>
For sanding, the sanding machine was made ready. Sanding operation is dependent on the thickness of the plain board. The thickness of the saw boards was observed and the machine was adjusted accordingly to cut maximum 0.5mm and cut on each motor (top and bottom). The load was observed while the sanding operation was going on and the speed of the conveyor was adjusted such that that it did not take the load of more than 150 Amps. The boards thickness was checked at different points (longitudinal &amp; cross sectional). The variation of thickness should not be ± 0.1 of standard thickness. The standard thickness of the plain board for rough operation was 0.2mm more than the final lamination board. The dust suction of the sanding checked properly and thorough air cleaning is required at proper intervals to get more life of the bolts and to avoid the breakdowns of the machine.<br>
Sanding operation<br>
First operation The sanding machine was thoroughly cleaned. The belts were checked for damages and mounted into the machine by properly observing the<br><br>
direction of the behs. For rough operation 50 or 60 Grit belts were used. The air pressure was checked properly. The top and bottom air pressures were adjusted to not less than 4.5 Kgs/Cm^ and 2.0 Kgs/Cm^ respectively. The top and bottom oscillations were checked properly before starting the machine. The first motor was started with on-off by observing the oscillation. If the oscillation was proper, the operation was continued to take full speed. The same step can be repeated for the second motor. Therefore, the above steps ensured that the sanding machine was ready for operation.<br>
Second operation: Preparation of Graphite Pads The frame to be inserted in the machine was thoroughly cleaned and the suitable felt cloth (4 to 8mm) was mounted into the frame with suitable adhesive. Graphite paper was attached on the felt cloth with suitable adhesive and the frame was allowed to stand for some time for proper setting. The frame with this attachment was properly put into the machine in the grove. 100/120 Grit belts were mounted in the drums and the graphite pads must be inside the belts. The remaining operation was continued like the first operation and the cutting of the board with the sanding belt was not more than 0.1mm at each motor. The ampere range was maintained by adjusting the speed of the machine such that ampere range was not more than 100 Amps. The thickness of the board was observed and the standard/required thickness for lamination with in the levels of less than 0.1 to 0.2 mm variation within the board was maintained.<br>
C. Inspection and Segregation of the sanded boards<br>
For selection of sanded board for preparing lamination board, each board was inspected for physical verification. The lab reports of the mechanical properties of the laminate board were studied. The following points were considered at the time of inspection: 1. The board were defect free (without any damages); 2. The boards were within the tolerance of length, width and thickness; 3. Surface was smooth without any defects; 4. No unsanded portion was accepted on either side<br><br>
of the surface; 5. No Dents were accepted 6. Minor dents/holes were covered with cement filling. 7. No over size chips were allowed on the surface.<br>
2. Preparation of Resins<br>
Preparation of Phenol Formaldehyde (PF) Resin<br>
The raw materials used for preparation of PF resin are: (a.) Phenol (Granules 100% Pure); (b.) Formalin (Colorless with 36-37%); and (c.) Methanol.<br>
Batch Preparation:     Phenol = 215 Kgs and Formalin   =215   Kgs 1:1 Ratio<br>
Methanol   =185 Kgs Catalyst    =10 Kgs<br>
Formalin of 215 Kgs was charged in the Kettle Reactor and 215 Kgs of Phenol was added through vacuum suction and the mixture was stirred. Liquid ammonia was added for 10 Kgs to maintain the pH at 7.0. Steam heating was started to allow the temperature to go up to 75° C which was attained within 15 to 20 min. The steam heating was stopped and the exothermic reaction levels were allowed to advance further. The temperature of the above mixture was maintained at 100° C and the reaction was stopped. This reaction approximately continues for 3.0 hrs. The attainment of polymerization to requisite levels was confirmed by testing the set time and start time. Vacuum distillation was performed to remover the water quantity of 140 Kgs. The distillation was stopped followed by addition of 185 kgs of methanol after which cooling was started. The pH was adjusted and maintain at about 8.0. The liquid is in stringing form semi solid starts. To store it in drums, solvent was added to maintain the viscosity. Resin viscosity was maintained when it was checked with B4 Ford cup. The PF resin obtained from the above process had the following property: Viscosity 15 Sec with B-4 Ford cup, specific gravity-1.00 to 1.07, Geltime at 150°C - 90 to 100 Sec, pH 7.0 to 8.0.<br>
Preparation of Melamine Formaldehyde (MF) Resin<br><br>
Formalin    =   150Kgs.	NaOH:NBA = 5 Kgs.<br>
Melamine   =   125   Kgs.       MEG : 12 Kgs.<br>
Formalin was charged in the reactor and then melamine was added with continuous stirring. The ratio of melamine to formalin was maintained as 1:2.2. The pH was adjusted to 8.5 to 9.0 by the addition of 10% caustic solution. By continuous stirring heating was started. The temperature was maintained at 95° C by steam heating. The polymerization reaction was advanced further. The heating was continued till the required polymerization level was attained.
