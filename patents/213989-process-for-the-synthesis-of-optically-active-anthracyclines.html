				<td>PROCESS FOR THE SYNTHESIS OF OPTICALLY ACTIVE ANTHRACYCLINES<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention refers to a process for the synthesis of optically active<br>
anthracyclines wherein the optically active key intermediate (R) 2-acetyl-2-<br>
ihydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene 5,8-dialkoxy of formula I.<br><br>
wherein: R = C1-3 alkyl, preferably methyl.<br>
is prepared starting from 5,8-dialkoxy-3,4-dihydronaphthalene by acvlation,<br>
asymmetric dihydroxylation, transformation into chloroacetate dehydrochloridation<br>
and final hydrolysis.<br>
The invention refers also to the intermediates of formula V e VI:<br><br>
Having an enantiomeric excess higher than 95%.<br>
State of the art<br>
As it is known the anthracyclines of formula VIII<br><br>
Wherein: R1 = H, OH, OCH3; R2 = H, OH; R3 = X,Y o Z where<br><br><br>
are compounds having a wide therapeutic use as anti-neoplastic drugs.<br>
Known compounds of formula VIII having the above said properties are for<br>
example Daunomicin (VIII, wherein: R1 = OCH3, R2 = H, R3 = X), la Doxorubicin<br>
(VIII wherein: R1 = OCH3, R2 = OH, R3 = X), I"Hydrarubicin (VIII wherein: R1 = H,<br>
R2 = H, R3 = X) e I"Epirubicin (VIII wherein: R1 = OCH3, R2 = OH, R3 = Y), or the<br>
compounds described in EP721456, in particular the compound of formula VIII<br>
wherein R1 = H, R2 = OH, R3 = Z, disaccharide anthracycline which is now under<br>
clinical development.<br>
The synthesis of anthracycline of formula VIII requires many steps and is normally<br>
performed starting from an optically active tetraline of formula I which is reacted by<br>
a Friedel-Craftsreaction with phthalic anhydride or its derivatives as phthaloyll<br>
dichloride or phthaloyll chloride methylester and thereafter cyclised. The so<br>
obtained tetracycle is protected in the 13-oxo position with ethylenglycol, is<br>
brominated in position 7 and converted into a 7-OH derivative with known methods<br>
(see Arcamone et al., Experientia, 1978,34,1255; Wong et al. Can. J. Chem.,<br>
1971, 49, 2712; Swenton et al. , Tetrahedron, 1984,40, 4625). After deprotection<br>
the anthracyclinone of formula VII (wherein R2 = H) is used as such or is converted<br>
into a 14 acyloxy derivative (compound of formula VII wherein R2 = O-<br>
acyl)according to known procedures. Thereafter the compounds of formula VII are<br>
glycosidated with protected mono- or disaccharides as described in literature (see<br>
Arcamone et al., Experientia, 1978,34, 1255; Terashima et al., Bull. Chem. Soc.<br>
Jpn, 1986, 59, 423 ) and in EP.....6, by deprotection the anthracycline of formula<br>
VIII are obtained.<br>
In the above described process, or in other similar processes which include as<br>
intermediate a tetraline, the key intermediate is the tetraline of formula I itself as<br>
above defined.<br><br>
This AB synthon (Wong et al. Can. J. Chem, 1971, 49, 2712) allows the formation<br>
of the corresponding optically active anthracyclinone of formula VII wherein R1 =<br>
H, OH, OCH3 and R2 = H, OH, O-acyl wherein the acyl group is chosen among<br>
formyl, acetyl, mono-, di- or trichloroacetyl, preferably acetyl.<br><br>
As above said the compound is finally converted in the desired anthracycline.<br>
The stereochemistry of position C-9 of the anthracyclinone is very important for the<br>
biological activity of these compounds since only the compounds having (S)<br>
configuration in C-9 show an antitumour activity.<br>
Therefore also the tetraline intermediate of formula I must obviously possess the<br>
same stereochemistry (i.e. an absolute configuration R).<br>
The tetraline I is normally prepared. According to the literature, as a racernic<br>
mixture starting from 2-acetyI-5,8-dimethoxy tetraline III by oxydrilation in position<br>
C-2 with potassium t-butoxide/t-butanole in the presence of oxygen followed by<br>
reduction "in situ" (Wong et al., Can. J. Chem., 1971, 49, 2712 ; Gardner et al.,<br>
J.Org. Chem.1968, 33, 3294).<br>
The compound III was prepared, with very low yields by reacting 5,8-dimethoxy-<br>
3,4-dihydronaphthalene II with N-N-diphenylacetamide- POCI3 applying the<br>
conditions of the Vilsmeier-Haack reaction followed by the reduction of the double<br>
bond.<br>
Several attempts of acylating compound II have been reported but all unsuccessful<br>
(Rama Rao et al. Ind.J.Chem. 1985, 24B, 697).<br>
Alternatively the compound III was prepared with a yield of about 50% in 4 steps<br>
by reaction of 5,8-diacetoxy-3,4-dihydronaphthalene with acetyl chloride/AICl3 and<br>
formation of a chloroacetyl derivative, followed by dehydrochloridation with LiCI,<br>
hydrolysis and methylation "in situ" (Russell et al. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Comm.<br>
1983, 994).<br><br>
Another reaction path for obtaining the precursor III reported in literature includes<br>
five steps starting from 5,8-dihydroxy-1,4-diidronphthalene with a total yield of<br>
about 50% (Giles et al. S.Afr.J.Chem, 1990,43, 87).<br>
The racemic tetraline I is thereafter converted into the pure enantiomeric<br>
compound using the normal methods applied for the resolution of racemes through<br>
diastereoisomeric Schiff bases on the acetyl lateral chain with (-)-1-<br>
phenylethylamine (Arcamone et al. BP 02691/75, 1975). Alternatively the<br>
enantiomeric pure compound was prepared by Kinetic resolution via a Sharpless<br>
asymmetric epoxidation followed by oxidation of the obtained allyl alcohol obtained<br>
by reducing 2-acetyl-5,8-dimethoxy-3,4dihydronaphthalene (Sharpless et al.<br>
J.Am.Chem.Soc. 1981, 103. 6237). Another method for obtaining the optically<br>
pure tetraline consists in the stereoselective reduction of the racemic mixture with<br>
bakers" yeast to diastereoisomeric dioles mixtures followed by chromatographic<br>
separation and re-oxidation (Terashima et al., Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1984, 32.<br>
4328).<br>
An asymmetric synthesis of the tetraline I starting from precursor III by<br>
enantioselective dihydroxylation is described in M. Nakajima et al. Tetrahedron,<br>
1993, 49, 10807, but the several steps and the final excess of tetraline I and<br>
especially the use of osmium tetraoxide in stoichiometric quantities, instead of<br>
catalytic, quantities and the use of expensive chiral amines (always in<br>
stoichiometric quantities) quantities at a temperature of - 110°C, makes very<br>
difficult the industrial use of this synthesis.<br>
Other asymmetric synthesis of AB synthon using chiral compounds or compounds<br>
comprising chiral derivatives of natural compounds are reported in literature but all<br>
these synthesis are very complex and unsuitable for industrial application (Krohn,<br>
Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl., 1986, 25, 790).<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The present invention describes a process for the preparation of anthracyclines of<br>
formula VIII as above defined VIII wherein the optically active tetraline of formula I<br>
as above defined is stereoselectively prepared starting from 5,8-dialkoxy-3,4-<br>
dihydronaphthalene II which, contrary to the methods applying the resolution of<br>
racemic mixture, which are difficult to perform, and give yields inferior to 30%,<br><br>
shows the advantage of giving the key intermediate I in yields much higher than<br>
those reported in literature and is easily industrially exploitable .<br>
In particular, although the literature reported as fruitless, or non interesting<br>
because of the low yields, the attempts of acylating compound II ( Rama Rao et al.<br>
Ind.J.Chem.1985, 24B, 697, Russell et al. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Comm. 1983,<br>
994, Giles et al. S.Afr.J.Chem, 1990,43, 87), the 5,8-dialkoxy-3,4-<br>
dihydronaphthalene (compound of formula II wherein R is a group C1-3 alkyl,<br>
preferably methyl) can surprisingly be acylated in just one step in the presence of<br>
an acyl chloride and aluminium trichloride forming the corresponding acyl<br>
derivative III. Moreover this innovative application of the procedure of<br>
enantioselective catalytic dihydroxylation of olefins (Sharpiess et al., Chem. Rev.<br>
1994, 94, 2483) to give the insature acyl derivative allows to obtain the optically<br>
active diol IV in a good yield. The compound is thereafter converted into the<br>
corresponding 1-chloro-2-acetyl-derivative by Sharpiess procedure (Sharpiess et<br>
al, Tetrahedron, 1992, 48, 10515) and dehalogenated following known methods,<br>
for example by catalytic hydrogenation or in the presence of tin and a radical<br>
precursor or can be directly dehydroxylated by catalytic reduction. The final<br>
hydrolysis of the ester group allows the formation of compound I in good yields<br>
and high optical purity.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
In Schema I it is reported a process for obtaining the tetraline of formula I wherein<br>
R = CH3. In this case the starting product is the 5,8-dimethoxy-3,4-<br>
dihydronaphthalene II, obtained by known methods starting from butadiene and p-<br>
quinone (Fieser et al., J.Am.Chem.Soc, 1948, 70, 3151).<br>
In spite of the fact that in literature the attempts of acylating the compound II were<br>
reported as fruitless or non interesting because of the low yields, the 5,8-<br>
dimethoxy-3,4-dihydronaphthalene II is treated with acetyl chloride in the<br>
presence of an excess of aluminium trichloride, preferably 5-9 moles of<br>
aluminium trichloride for one mole of acyl chloride, at the temperature of -35° ÷<br>
25°C, preferably at 0°C. After the usual work-up and crystallisation with ethyl<br>
acetate, the product, 2-acetyl-5.8-dimethoxy-3,4-dihydronaphthalene is obtained<br>
in yields higher than 70%.<br><br>
Compound III is stereoselectively converted to diol IV by a Sharpless asymmetric<br>
dihydroxylation which is described in literature for other olefin substrates<br>
(Sharpless et al., Chem. Rev. 1994, 94, 2483). The reactive used in this step is<br>
AD-mix a (catalogue Aldrich, reactive 39275-8, see also J. Org. Chem. 1992, 57,<br>
2768) with a further addition of the osmium salt (K2OsO2(OH)4) and<br>
methanesulphonamide.<br>
The osmium salt is always in catalytic quantity vis-a-vis the substrate. The reaction<br>
is performed at low temperature,-4 e +20°C, preferably at 0°C, the yield is 70%,<br>
with an enantiomeric excess higher than 95%.<br>
The optically active diol IV is converted into a chloroacetate V through the<br>
formation "in situ" of a cycle intermediate using trimethylortoacetate in the<br>
presence of an acid catalyst followed by treatment with trimethylsilyl chloride<br>
according to a method already described in literature for different dioles (Sharpless<br>
et al. Tetrahedron, 1992, 48,10515).<br>
This step gives yields higher then 80%.<br>
The reduction of the chloroacetate to acetate VI can be performed photochemical<br>
or by thermic treatment in the presence of tributyltinhydride and radical precursors<br>
as AIBN or BPO or by catalytic hydrogenation.<br>
The yields are higher then 80%.<br>
The acetate can be obtained directly by catalytic reduction of diol IV.<br>
The hydrolysis of the acetate can be performed with ionic exchange resins in<br>
quantitative yield. Alternatively the known methods for the hydrolysis of the<br>
acetates, as the treatment with sodium methoxide or sodium hydroxide.<br>
What reported in Scheme I can be easily applied to the synthesis of all the<br>
compounds of formula I, using the corresponding starting products.<br>
The tetraline I which is an object of the present invention is therefore obtained in<br>
only 4-5 steps with a total yield much higher than the one reported for the known<br>
processes.<br>
Moreover, the reaction conditions as described make it possible the industrial<br>
scale up of the process. The subsequent steps of the process through the<br>
anthracyclinone to the final anthracycline are performed as described in literature.<br><br>
The process according to the invention will be better understood in the light of the<br>
hereinafter reported Example which refers to the Scheme 1 i.e. to the preparation<br>
of the tetraline of formula I wherein R = CH3.<br>
