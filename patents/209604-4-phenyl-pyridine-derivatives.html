The compounds of formula I and their salts are characterized by valuable therapeutic properties. It has been surprisingly found that the compounds of the present invention are antagonists of the Neurokinin 1 (NK-1, substance P) receptor. Substance P is a naturally occurring undecapeptide belonging to the tachykinin family of peptides, the latter being so-named because of their prompt contractile action on extravascular smooth muscle tissue. The receptor for substance P is a member of the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors.<br>
The neuropeptide receptor for substance P (NK-1) is widely distributed throughout the mammalian nervous system (especially brain and spinal ganglia), the circulatory system and peripheral tissues (especially the duodenum and jejunum) and are involved in regulating a nimiber of diverse biological processes.<br>
The central and peripheral actions of the mammalian tachykinin substance P have been associated with numerous inflammatory conditions including migraine, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and inflammatory bowel disease as well as mediation of the emetic reflex and the modulation of central nervous system (CNS) disorders such as Parkinson's disease (Neurosd. Res,, 1996,7,187-214), anxiety (Can. J, Phys., 1997,75,612-621) and depression (Science, 1998,281,1640-1645).<br>
Evidence for the usefulness of tachykinin receptor antagonists in pain, headache, especially migraine, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, attenuation of morphine withdrawal, cardiovascular changes, oedema, such as oedema caused by thermal injury, chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma/bronchial hyperreactivity and other respiratory diseases including allergic rhinitis, inflammatory diseases of the gut including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, ocular injury and ocular<br><br>
inflammatory diseases reviewed in "Tachykinin Receptor and Tachykinin Receptor Antagonists'*, J. Auton. Pharmacol, 13,23-93,1993.    ;<br>
Furthermore, Neurokinin 1 receptor antagonists are being developed for the treatment of a number of physiological disorders associated with an excess or imbalance of tachykinin, in particular substance P. Examples of conditions in which substance P has been impHcated include disorders of the central nervous system such as anxiety, depression and psychosis (WO 95/16679, WO 95/18124 and WO 95/23798).<br>
The neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists are further useful for the treatment of motion sickness and for treatment induced vomiting.<br>
In addition, in The New En^and Journal of Medicine, Vol. 340, No. 3 190-195,1999 has been described the reduction of cisplatin-induced emesis by a selective neurokinin-1-receptor antagonist.<br>
Furthermore, US 5,972,938 describes a method for treating a psychoimmtmologic or a psychosomatic disorder by administration of a tachykinin receptor, such as NK-1 receptor antagonist.<br>
The usefulness of neurokinin 1 receptor antagonists for the treatment of certain forms of urinary incontinence is further described in "Neuropeptides, 32(1), 1-49, (1998)" and "Eur. J. Pharmacol., 383(3), 297-303, (1999)".<br>
The compounds of formula I can also be used in form of their prodrugs. Examples are esters, N-oxides, phosphate esters, glycoamide esters, glyceride conjugates and the like. The prodrugs may add to the value of the present compounds advantages in adsorption, pharmacokinetics in distribution and transport to the brain.<br>

As mentioned earlier, the compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically usable addition salts possess valuable pharmacological properties. It has been found that the compounds of the present invention are antagonists of the Neurokinin 1 (NK-1&gt; substance P) receptor.<br>
The compounds were investigated in accordance with the tests given hereinafter.<br>
The affinity of test compounds for the NKi receptor was evaluated at human NKi receptors in CHO cells infected with the human NKi receptor (using the Semliki virus expression system) and radiolabelled with [^H] substance P (final concentration 0.6 nM). Binding assays were performed in HEPES buffer (50 mM, pH 7.4) containing BSA (0.04 %)<br><br>
leupeptin (8 fxg / ml), MnCl2 (3mM) and phosphoramidon (2 ^M). Binding assays consisted of 250 yl of membrane suspension (1.25x10^ cells I assay tube), 0,125 \£L of buffer of displacing agent and 125 pi of [^Hjsubstance P. Displacement curves were determined "with at least seven concentrations of the compound. The assay tubes were incubated for 60 min at room temperature after which time the tube contents were rapidly filtered tmder vacuum through GF/C filters presoaked for 60 min with PEI (0.3 %) with 2 x 2 ml washes of HEPES buffer (50 mM, pH 7.4). The radioactivity retained on the filters was measured by scintillation counting. All assays were performed in tripKcate in at least 2 separate experiments.<br>
The af&amp;nity to the NK-1 receptor for preferred compounds, given as pKi, is in the scope oi%30 - 9.50 for the described coxxxpoxm^.<br><br>
The compounds of formula I as well as their pharmaceutically usable acid addition salts can be used as medicaments, e.g. in the form of pharmaceutical preparations. The pharmaceutical preparations can be administered orally, e.g. in the form of tablets, coated tablets, dragees, hard and soft gelatine capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions. The administration can, however, also be effected rectally, e.g. in the form of suppositories, or parenterally, e.g. in the form of injection solutions.<br><br>
The compounds of foraiula I and their pharmaceutically usable add addition salts can be processed with phannaceutically inert, inorganic or organic excipients for the production oftablets, coated tablets, dragees and hard gelatine capsules. Lactose, com starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts etc can he used as such excipients e.g. for tablets, dragees and hard gelatine capsules.<br>
Suitable excipients for soft gelatine capsules are e.g. vegetable oils, waxes, fats, semisolid and liquid polyols etc.<br>
