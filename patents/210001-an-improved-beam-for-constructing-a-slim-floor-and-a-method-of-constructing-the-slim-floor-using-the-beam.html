				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to an improved beam for constructing a slim floor and a method of constructing the slim floor using the beam.<br>
The  invention relates more particularly to a beam, called "slim floor beam",  for use as a substitute for the conventional reinforced cement concrete  (RCC)  beam in the construction of buildings,  bridges and warehouses,  comprising a rolled steel beam of I-section having a bottom steel plate of width larger than that of the bottom flange of the I-section beam,  which is welded to the lower surface of the bottom flange of the I-section been and a plurality of steel studs welded centrally along the length of the upper surface of the top flange thereof, a deck of steel sleet having a trapezoidal section mounted by tack welding on the upper surface of the bottom steel plate with the vertical section lying in a plane parallel to one longituditional side of the beam and a RCC slab cast on the upper surface of both the beam and deck encasing the beam in the concrete.<br>
The conventional reinforced cement concrete  (RCC) beam is made  of steel reinforcement bars and concrete mix in the following steps  :-<br>
(i)    fixing of props and shutters; (ii)    cutting and bending of steel bars and stirrups for<br>
use as reinforcement; (iii)    laying and lapping of the reinforcement bars fixed<br>
with stirrups thereon; (iv)    preparing a concrete mix containing cement,  sand,<br>
stone chip and water;<br>
-    2    -<br><br>
(v)    casting of the  concrete mix for making the RCC beam and floor slab in the shutters; (vi)    curing of the cast; (vii)    removing the props and shutterings;  and (viii)    finishing of the beam and floor slab.<br>
The main disadvantages of using RCC beams are  :-<br>
(a)	the depth of the RCC beams being increased with<br>
increase in load and span, these are virtually<br>
unacceptable for higher loads and larger span;  and<br>
(b)	their construction is time-consuming because of use<br>
of props and shutters,  and the need for finishing<br>
of the beam.<br>
The aim of the present invention is to provide an alternative beam which is constructed at a faster rate without the need of propping (upto 6 m span), shuttering,  and finishing, and can support heavier load at a wider span for the same depth of a conventional RCC beam.<br>
Thus the invention provides an improved beam for constructing a slim floor  by using the beam as substitute for the conventional reinforced cement concrete  (RCC) beam, characterised in that the beam comprises a rolled steel beam of I-section,   a bottom steel plate welded to the lower surface of bottom flange of the I-section beam,  a plurality of steel studs fixed centrally by welding at required intervals in the longitudinal direction on the upper surface of top flange of the I-section beam,  a profiled deck of steel sheet of required thickness having trough portions  of trapezoidal sections mounted by tack welding at required intervals on the upper surface of<br>
-    3    -<br><br>
the bottom steel plate with the vertical section thereof lying in a plane parallel to the longitudinal side of the I-section beam and a RCC slab cast on the upper surface of both the I-section beam and profiled deck, encasing the  I-section beam in the concrete.<br>
The  invention provides also a method of constructing the slim floor by using the beam comprising the following steps :-(i)    cutting the required lengths of I-section of a rolled steel beam and bottom steel plate of width greater than the width of the bottom flange  of I-section beam by means of gas cutting equipments; (ii)    welding of bottom steel plate to the lower surface of bottom flange of I-section beam symmetrically and co-axially in the longitudinal direction of the beam; (iii)    placing profiled deck having trough portions of<br>
trapezoidal sections,  on steel plate at both sidesof I-section and fixing the  deck to the steel plate in position by tack welding at the areas of contact thereof,  the upper surface  of the deck being provided with indentations or small mechanical anchors for attaining composite  action between the deck and the RCC cast the reon, encasing the beam in concrete; (iv)    fixing by welding a plurality of steel studs<br>
vertically along the central line  on the upper surface of top flange of the I-section beam at required intervals in the longitudinal direction thereof,  to act as shear connectors between the beam<br>
and the RCC slab;<br>
-    4   -<br><br>
(v)    laying and lapping of reinforcement mesh on the upper surface of top flange of I-section beam in both the longitudinal and transverse direction of the slab and laying and lapping of reinforcement bars  in each trough portion of the profiled deck; (vi)    preparing the concrete mix of cement,  sand,  stone chip and water; (vii)    casting of the concrete mix to form the  slab; (viii)    curing of the cast;    and (ix)    finishing of the slab.<br>
The invention is described fully and particularly in an unrestricted manner with reference to the accompanying drawings in v/hich -<br>
Figure 1 is a schematic view of the slim floor beam with its component parts;<br>
Figure 2 depicts a sectional view of the profiled dick; Figure 3 shows (a)  transverse section and (b) longitudinal section of the slim floor beam mounted on columns.<br>
Referring the Figs.   1,  2 and 3,   the steps followed for constructing the  invented slim floor beam are   :-<br>
1)	cutting the  required lengths of a rolled steel I-section beam (1)  and bottom steel plate  (2)  of width greater than the width of the bottom flange of I-section beam by means  of gas cutting equipments;<br>
2)	welding of bottom steel plate (2) to the lower surface of bottom flange  (3) of I-section beam symmetrically and co-axially in the longitudinal direction of the I-section beam;<br>
-    5    -<br><br>
3)	placing profiled steel plate deck (4) having trapezodial section (4a) on steel plate (2) and fixing the two in position by tack welding at their areas of contact, the upper surface of the deck being provided with indentations or small mechanical anchors for attaining composite action between the deck and the RCC slab (8) cast thereon encasing the I-section beam in concrete;<br>
4)	fixing by welding a plurality of steel studs (6) along the central line on the upper surface of top flange (7) of the beam at required intervals in the longitudinal direction thereof, to act as shear connectors between the beam and the RCC slab;<br>
5)	laying and lapping of reinforcement mesh (5) on the upper surface of top flange of I-section beam in both the longitudinal and transverse direction of the slab and lapping of reinforcement bars (5a) in each trough portion of profiled deck;<br>
6)	preparing the concrete mix of cement, sand, stone chip and water;<br>
7)	casting of the concrete mix to form the slab;<br>
8)	curing of the cast; and<br>
9)	finishing of the slab.<br>
In the typical embodiment of the slim floor beam, the rolled steel I-section beam is of specification No.ISMB 300 (depth 300 mm, flange width 140 mm, web thickness 7.5 mm, average flange thickness 12.4 mm) of grade SAIIMA 410 (Minimum<br>
- 6 -<br><br>
yield strength 410 MPa) and the steel plate welded to the bottom flange of the I-section beam is of 325 mm width,20 mm thickness, and, grade SAIIMA 410 (Minimum yield strength 410 MPa); the fixing studs acting as shear connectors are of 19 mm diameter, 70 mm length and yield strength more than 400 MPa; the concrete (of M-30 grade) slab over the top surface of the I-section beam is of thickness 85 mm, width 1250 mm and span (along the beam length) 5000 mm; the profiled deck is made of 1.25 mm thick cold rolled steel sheet (Minimum yield strength 250 MPa) with trapezoidal sections each of width 188 mm at the upper open side and 57 mm at the lower closed side, and placed at a distance of 600 mm centre to centre between the adjacent ones thereof as shown in Figure 2. The slim floor beam did not yield under a point load of upto 90T applied at mid-span during testing, 90T being the maximum capacity of the testing machine used. The deflection measured at the mid-span of the slim floor beam indicates that the beams are safe as per the code provision of IS s 800 : 1984 for service load limit.<br>
The slim floor beam is of advantage particularly in the construction of ware houses and large span buildings (as illustrated in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b)) as well as in the construction of bridge decks.<br>
Although the estimated cost of construction of a 7-storeyed building of length 25m and width 16m with column spacing 5m along length and 4m along width using the slim floor beam is of the same order as that of the building constructed<br>
- 7 -<br><br>
using the conventional RCC beams, there are certain other advantages of using the slim floor beam, such as,<br>
1•  The time of construction is expected to be less by about 20%.<br>
2.	The depth of the beam is less for the same load bearing capacity with effective higher floor height.<br>
3.	Seismic resistance is higher as ductility of the structure increases due to utilisation of a higher percentage of steel in slim floor beam.<br>
4.	Unhindered passages are available for the service lines•<br>
5.	The aesthetic appeal of the structure improves appreciably.<br>
