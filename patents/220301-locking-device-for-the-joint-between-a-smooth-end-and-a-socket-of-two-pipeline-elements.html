intended, to bear on the radially outer surface of the smootj?. end to loci: the joint between the two pipeline element?;.<br>
Such devices are used for the locking of pipeline pipes. A<br>
plurality of inserts, are in this case regularly distributed<br>
angularly and are peripherally joined by the binding ring?. The<br>
looking chamber is constructed in the socket or in a lofcking<br>
counter!:lang-5 fixed onto the socket..	Tie inserts are provided on their radially inner surface<br>
with teeth intended to catch directly on the outer surface of the<br>
smooth end,, to prevent, after the joining of two pipes&gt; the<br>
withdrawal of the smooth end out of the corresponding^sockejt. In<br>
a known arrangement (EP-A--0 235 ois), a connecting part, ojf the<br>
ring extends over the outer extremity face of each insierf: and<br>
joins the ring to a retention collar, outside the lacking<br>
cha.ni.ber, intended to bear on a rear bearing surface integral with<br>
the socket.	;<br>
This retention collar mak
 <br>
Upon its introduction into the locking chamber,! the<br>
extremity of the smooth end comes into abutment on the uter<br>
(extremity face of the inserts, between the radially inner|edge<br>
iof this face arid the radially inner edge of the corresponding<br>
(connecting part of the ring.The extremity of the smooth end then pushes the radially<br>
1 inner edge of the outer extremity face of the insert is the<br>
i	.         <br>
direction axially opposite to the retention force- exerted b|f the<br>
collar on the insert, thereby creating a force couple whic|i may<br>
cause the insert to tilt, and even cause the insert and thej ring<br>
to come apart.	<br>
This phenomenon appears essentially in the case whsrje- the [play between the socket and the smooth end is small, especially<br>
!	:|<br>
j when the two pipeline elements have thick coatings.      This tilting may lead to an undesirable position of the<br>
; insert, the surface provided with teeth nob being orijented<br>
towards the radially outer surface of the smooth end and jhence<br>
:	'i<br>
; not being able to perforn its catching role.	<br>
The object of ths invention is to solve the problem sa'jt out<br>
above l:y providing a locking device which makes it possible, in<br>
a simple and economical manner, to avoid incorrect positioning,<br>
upon the penetration of the smooth end into the locking chamber,<br>
of a blocking insert of the crown placed in readiness ijh the<br>
lockinc chamber.	<br>
To this end, the subject of the invention is a idfcking device of the above-mentioned type, characterized in thet. the<br>
said connecting part of the ring is continued radially iiiwards<br>
f by a flange for abutment of the extremity of the smooth end.<br>
Ac.cording to specific embodiments, the device may include<br>
one or ir-.ore of the following features:	<br>

-	the sale  abutment flange extends radially inwards  |)eyond<br><br>
the radially inner edge of the outer extremity surface oj£ the insert by a distance h which is greater than 4% of the!! mean<br>
radial height of the insert,	<br><br>
-	the said abutment flange extends radially inwards t|eyond<br>
the radially inner edge of the outer extremity surface of the<br><br>
insert by a distance h which is greater than 3% of the mean radial displacement of the ring when it is placed arounh the smooth end,<br>
-	the said outer extremity surface of the insert is<br>
continued radially inwards by a rounded and/or chamfered junction<br>
zone,	!<br>
-	the said abutment flange of the ring at least partjjially<br>
covers the junction zone,	<br>
-	the said abutment flange of the ring is continued ajfially<br>
inwards along at least a part of the radially inner surface of<br>
the insert,	<br>
-	the device comprises an axial retention part intended to<br>
!<br>
bear on a rear bearing surface integral with the socket, to<br>
the axial displacements of the crown upon the introduction |if the<br>
smooth end into the socket,	<br>
-	the blocking crown comprises a. part forming a pacing to<br>
 ensure the sealing between the two joined pipeline eilement, and<br>
-	the said sealing body is intended to come to bear at least<br>
partially against a radially inner collar of the socket<br>
This subject of the invention is also a joint between pipeline elements, especially pipes, comprising a smooth ind of a first pipeline element introduced into a socket of a second pipeline element, the second pipeline element also comprising a locking chamber integral with the socket, the said chamber! being formed in the socket or in a counterflange fixed onto the letter, characterized in that it comprises a locking device in whijph the blocking crown is lodged in the said chamber, a radiallyjouter<br><br>
surface of the crown bearing on an inclined reaction surface of the locking chamber, and the radially inner surface of the jlnsert bearing on the radially outer surface of the smooth end, thereby locking the joint between the two pipeline elements. <br>
In one embodiment, the joint comprises a radial-comprfession<br><br>
[packing interposed between the smooth end and the socket.<br>
Ths invention will be better understood on reading the jdescription which follows, given purely by way of exainpl4 and with reference to the appended drawings, in which:<br>
-	Figure 1 is a half-view in longitudinal section, before<br>
the joining, of a smooth end of a first pipeline; pipe and of a<br>
socket of a second pipeline pipe fitted with a'locking device<br>
according to the invention, this view being taken in a diametral<br>
plane passing through a blocking insert of the locking devp.ce,<br>
-	Figure 2 is an enlarged view of the encircled zone JEl of<br>
' Figure ].. ,	<br>
-	Figure - is a view analogous to the view of Figuie 2,<br>
illustrating &amp; variant of: the embodiment of Figure 1,    -	Figures 4 and 5 are views analogous to Figure <br>
and one of its variants, and	::<br>
-	Figure 6 is a view analogous to Figure 1 illustrating a<br>
third embodiment of the invention after the joining of thfe two<br>
pipeline elements.	:<br>
Shown in Figure 1 are a snooth end 1, or male end,  of a first pipeline pipe 2 and a socket 3, or female end, of a second pipeline pipe 4, which are ready to be joined. The smooth fend 1 and the socket 3 ares arranged substantially coaxially. <br>
These pipes may be, in particular, successive pipes of a<br>
pipeline, especially made of ductile cast iron, each i pipe<br>
including a smooth end 1 at one extremity and a socket S 3 at<br>
another extrenity.	<br>
Tl^e smooth end 1 has a cylindrical radially outer surface<br>
5 joined by a convergent surface 6 to the face ',' of the ;front<br>
extremity 6 of the smooth end l.	<br>
Ir.ternally, the socket 3 has, successively, a convergent frustoconical entrance surface 9, a cylindrical surface 10 for guidinc the smooth end, an annular grcove il, an annular bdss 12 and fir ally a. sealing chamber 13 shown partially in Figurfs l.<br>
Ar. annular radial-compression packing 14, whose axliis is coincident with the axis of the pipe 4, has an annular 4retention heel 15 lodged in the groove n. This heel 15 is<br><br>
continued axially towards the interior of the socket 3 (t the<br>
ii right in Figure l) by a sealing body 16 lodged in the chamber 1.<br>
Externally, the socket 3 has starting from its entrj&amp;nce, situated at its rear extremity 17, a radially projecting cibllar 18, followed by a greatly convergent surface 19 joined to the standard outer ssurface 20 of the ssockest 3.<br>
A locking counteirflange 21 is fixed by virtue of fixing screw-bolt connections 22 (of which only one is.shown in FJLgure 1) onto the socket 3, at the rear extremity 17 of the lattfer.<br>
This counterflange 21 comprises a substantially<br>
frustoconical part 23 arranged coaxially with the socket 0 and<br>
continued radially outwards by a web 24. This web IJJ4 is<br>
terminated by a peripheral shoulder 25 extending axially bteyond<br>
the front extremity face 26 of the counter flange 21. I; This<br>
extremity face 26 bears on the face 27 of the rear extremity 17<br>
of the socket 3.	<br>
The web 24 is pierced, with orifices 28 regularly distributed<br>
angularly, through which screw bolts 29 of the scrawl-bolt<br>
connections 122 pass freely. These screw bolts 29 each comprise<br>
a threaded end 30 and an end 31 provided with an eccentric heel<br>
32 bearing on the surface 19 of the socket 3.	<br>
A nut 33 is screwed onto the end 30 of each screw bo-It 29 and bears on the rear surface 34 of the web 24. The screw-taolt connections 22 thus ensure the rigid securing<br>
of the counterflange 21 and the socket 3.	!!<br>
The part 23 of the sounterflange 21 has, internally, a reaction surface 35 which is substantially spherical and converges towsurds the rear extremity 36 of the counter flange 21.<br>
At. the front extremity 26 of the counterflange 21,i this surface. 35 has a radial opening substantially larger thajn the radial opening of the entrance surface 9 of th«j socket 3. The surface' 35 delimits, internally, a locking chamber 37. I<br>
The rear extremity of the part: 23 has an outer fadial<br>
bearinc: surface 38.	<br>
The counterflange 21 is fitted with a locking device 39 comprising a blocking crown 40 lodged in readiness in the lacking chanfoer 37,. and a retention collar 41 situated at "the exterior<br><br>
of the chamber 37 and bearing on the surface 38.<br>
Ths crown 40 comprises metallic blocking inserts 42 regularly distributed angularly and joined to one another by a binding ring 43 made of elastomer.<br>
These inserts 42 are blocks having a substantially trapezoidal longitudinal section with a small substantially radial rear or outer face 44 (Figure 2), a large substantially radial front or inner face provided with a transverse groove, a radially inner surface 45 provided with catching teeth 46, and a radially outer surface which converges towards the rear extremity 36 of the counterflange 21.<br>
Th« rear faces 44 of the inserts 42 are oriented towards the front extremity a of the smooth end 3 [sic], and towards the axially outer extremity of the chamber 37.<br>
The ring 43 comprises a radially outer web 47 peripherally joining the radially outer surfaces of the inserts 42. This web 47 Is continued, towards the front extremity of: the counterflange, by a substantially radial part 48 running along the frcnt face of each insert 42, this part 48 being provided with an annular boss projecting rearwards and lodged in the groove of the front face of each insert 42.<br>
The web 47 is continued rearwards by a radial connecting part 49 (Figure 2) extending along the face 44 of each insert 42. This part 49 is continued axially rearwards, and as far as the exterior of the chamber 37,, by a ;;rustoconical junction segment 50 flared outwards and terminated by a radial part 51 i;n which a metallic ring 52 is lodged. This radial part 51. forms the retention collar 41.<br>
The inserts 42 are intended, upon the introduction of the smooth end .1 into the chamber 37, to be displaced axially forwards and to move apart radially outwards, thisreby deforming the ring 43 so that the latter is; placed around the smooth end 1. The collar 41 ensures the axial retention of the crown 40 upon this introduction, thereby maintaining, on the one hand, the web 47 in the vicinity of the reaction surface 35 and, on the other hand, the surface 45 of each insert 42 in contact with the radially outer surface of the smooth end 1. Thus, after complete<br><br>
introduction of the smooth end 1 into the socket 3, the crof/n 40<br>
is radially compressed on the surface 5. When a separating force<br>
is exerted on the smooth end,  under the effect of the<br>
pressurizing of the pipeline, the web 47 comes into abujtaient<br>
;against the reaction surface 35, and the teeth 46 of the inserts<br>
:bite into the surface 5, thereby preventing the smooth end l from<br>
being withdrawn from the socket 3.<br>
As can be seen in Figure 2, the face 44 of the insert *62 is terminated by a radially inner edge 53 which is joined to the radially inner face 45 by a chamfered function [sic] zone :64.<br>
The connecting part 49 of the; ring 43 is continued radially<br>
:inwards beyond the radially inner edge 53 of the fc.ce 44 of the<br>
'insert 42 by an abutment flange 55. This flange; 55 extends<br>
radially inwards, in overhanging fashion, beyond the edge 53 over<br>
a distance h_.<br>
Tb.e radially inner surface 56 of the flange 55 converges .'forwards and continues the- internal face of the segment 50.<br>
Upon the introduction of the smooth end l into the locking chamber 37, the front extremity 8 of the smooth end 3 [sic] comes into abutment against, the flange 55. The surface 56 of this fiance 55 slides successively on the surfaces 6 and 5 of the smooth end 3 [sic] while the junction segment 50 moves apart and the smooth end l advances progressively into the locking chamber •37.<br>
By virtue of this feature, the face 44 of the inserts, cannot abut directly against the front extremity 8 of the smooth end 3 [sic], and this avoids the risk of the inserts 42 tilting as 'mentioned above.<br>
Ir order that the flange 55 performs its abutment role correctly, especially when the segment 50 moves apart, the •distance J} is greater than 0.4 mm and/or greater than 4% of the mean radial height of: the inserts? 42 arid/or greater than 3% of the ir.ean radial displacement of the ring 43 when the crown 40 is placed around the smooth end 1.<br>
Preferably, the flange 55 extends radially ir.wards bjByond the resr edge 57 of the surface 45 of each insert 42.<br>
It is understood that the crown 40 of the locking device 39<br><br>
may be Lodged in a locking chamber formed in a counterflange, as shown in Figure 1, or in a locking chamber formed directly in the socket :i, for example between the entrance of the socket and the sealing chamber of the latter.<br>
In a variant shown in Figure 3, the abutment flange 55 is continued axially forwards (hence: towards the interior of the pipe 4) , thereby substantially covering the junction zone ^4 and a part of the radially inmsr surface 45 of the insert 42.<br>
In this variant, the radially inner surface 56 of the flange 55 is also continued forwards, beyond the junction zone 54, and partially covers the radially inner surface 45 of the insert 42. Figure 4 illustrates another embodiment of the invention, which is distinguished from the first embodiment in that the locking device does not comprise a. retention collar 41 andihence does net comprise a junction segment 50 between the latter and the blocking crown 40.<br>
The customary behaviour of such a device is distinguished from tbs behaviour of the device of the previous embodiment by the following.<br>
Upon the introduction of the smooth end 1 into the locking chamber 37, the said smooth end displaces the crown 40 axially, the crown 40 then being elastically returned by retention;means (not shown) which push the crown 40 axially rearwards, th0 said retention means being arranged between the said crown 40 afrtd the rear face 27 of the pipe on which they bear. These retention means thus ensure the axial retention of the crown 40 ensured by the collar 41 in the previous embodiment, and then the smooth end is introduced between the inserts; and moves the crown 40 apart to pass; through it.<br>
In this embodiment, the connecting part 49 is likewise continued radially inwards beyond the edge 53 in the form: of an abutment flange 55. The radially inner surface 56 of the abutment flange 55 likewise converges forwards.<br>
This feature makes it possible, in a manner analogous to the previous embodiment, to avoid the tilting of the inserts 42 when they are subjected to an axial penetration force of the: smooth end 1 mid to the opposite retention force.<br><br>
; Figure 5 illustrates a variant of the embodiment of Figure 4 (in which, in a manner analogous to the variant of Figure 3, the abutment flange 55 extends axially inwards, thereby covering the jifmctio-i zone 54 of the insert 42 and a part of -the radially ihner sarface 45 of the insert 42.<br>
Figure 6 illustrates another embodiment, in which the soqiket 31 has internally, successively, a convergent entrance surface 9, a cylindrical guiding surface 10, a lacking and scaling chamber 58 and an inner collar 59- The sealing chamber 58 has a substantially cylindrical inner surface 60 which is continued rearwaris by an inclined reaction surface 61.<br>
The crown 40 of th.e locking device is distinguished frorti the Icrown o:: the device of Figure 4 solely in that the front fac<f: and the web of ring are continued forwards by an annular radial-compression sealing body this coming to bear at leasit partially against collar figure also illustrates the: relative positions cifter joining smooth socket tha locking device s9.></f:>
In this embodiment, on the one hand the sealing body 62 cooperates with the surface 5 of the smooth end 1 and the facing cylindrical surface 60 of the chamber 58 to ensure the sealing of the joint between the two pipes 2 and 4, and on the other hand the surface 45 of each insert 42 cooperates with the surface 5 of the smooth end and the wet&gt; 47 of the ring 43 cooperates with the reaction surface 61 of the chamber 58 to ensure the locking between the two-pipes 2 and 4. In this case, upon the penetration of the smooth end, it is the elasticity produced by the axial compression of the body 62 against the collar 59 which ensures the axial retention force for the locking device 39 making it possible to mov
