Field of the Invention<br>
The invention provides compositions and methods for mitigating the deleterious effect of metal contaminants on catalytic cracking.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Catalytic cracking is a petroleum, refining process that is applied commercially on a very large scale. A majority of the refinery gasoline blending pool in the United States is produced by this process, with almost all being produced using the fluid catalytic cracking ("FCC") process. In the FCC process, heavy hydrocarbon fractions are converted into lighter products by reactions taking place at high temperature in the presence of a catalyst, with the majority of the conversion or cracking occurring in the gas phase. The FCC feedstock is thereby converted into gasoline, distillate and other liquid cracking products as well as lighter gaseous cracking products of four or fewer carbon atoms. These products, liquid and gas, consist of saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons.<br>
In FCC processes, feedstock is injected into the riser section of a FCC reactor, where it is cracked into lighter, more valuable products by contacting hot catalyst that has been circulated to the riser-reactor from a catalyst regenerator. As the endothermic cracking reactions take place, heavy carbon is deposited onto the catalyst. This heavy carbon, known as coke, reduces the activity of the catalyst and the catalyst must be regenerated to revive its activity. The catalyst and hydrocarbon vapors are carried up the riser to the disengagement section of the FCC reactor, where they are separated. Subsequently, the catalyst flows into a stripping section, where the hydrocarbon vapors entrained with the catalyst are stripped by steam injection. Following removal of occluded hydrocarbons from the spent cracking catalyst, the stripped catalyst flows through a spent catalyst standpipe and into the catalyst regenerator.<br>
Typically, catalyst is regenerated by introducing air into the regenerator and burning off the coke to restore catalyst activity. These coke combustion reactions are highly exothermic and as a result, heat the catalyst. The hot, reactivated catalyst flows through the regenerated catalyst standpipe back to the riser to complete the catalyst cycle. The coke combustion exhaust gas stream rises to the top of the regenerator through the regenerator flue. The exhaust gas generally contains nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur oxides (SOx), carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, ammonia, nitrogen, and oxygen.<br>
The performance of a fluid catalytic cracking unit can be measured by the conversion of crude hydrocarbon feedstock into useable products such as gasoline. With the addition of a catalytic cracking catalyst, conversion will increase, but so will the production of undesirable side products including coke and hydrogen gas. It is desirable to increase the conversion of an FCC unit while minimizing the increase in coke and H2 byproducts.<br>
The presence of metal contaminants in feedstock presents a serious problem. Common metal contaminants include iron, nickel, sodium, and vanadium. Some of these metals can promote dehydrogenation reactions during the cracking sequence, which can result in increased amounts of coke and light gases at the expense of gasoline production. Metal contaminants can also have a detrimental effect on cracking products. Metal contaminants can deposit on the catalyst and affect its stability and crystallinity. In some cases, the catalyst can be deactivated by the metal contaminants. During the regeneration step, metals present within the catalyst can volatize under the hydrothermal conditions and re-deposit on the catalyst.<br>
For example, vanadium contaminants in feedstock can poison the cracking catalyst and reduce its activity. One theory to explain this poisoning mechanism is that vanadium compounds in the feedstock can become incorporated into the coke deposited on the cracking catalyst, and are then oxidized to vanadium pentoxide in the regenerator as the coke is burned off. Vanadium pentoxide can react with water vapor in the regenerator to form vanadic acid, which can then react with the cracking catalyst to destroy its crystallinity and reduce its activity.<br><br>
Because compounds containing vanadium and other metal contaminants cannot generally be removed from the FCC unit as volatile compounds, the usual approach has been to passivate these compounds under the conditions encountered during the cracking process. Passivation can involve incorporating additives into the cracking catalyst or adding separate additive particles into the FCC unit along with the cracking catalyst. These additives can preferentially combine with the metal contaminants and act as "traps" or "sinks" so that the active component of the cracking catalyst is protected. Metal contaminants can then be removed along with the catalyst that is withdrawn from the unit during its normal operation. Fresh metal passivating additives can then be added to the unit, along with makeup catalyst, in order to affect a continuous withdrawal of the detrimental metal contaminants during operation of the FCC unit. Depending on the level of metal contaminants in the feedstock, the quantity of additive can be varied relative to the makeup catalyst in order to achieve the desired degree of metals passivation.<br>
Industrial facilities are continuously trying to find new and improved methods to increase the conversion of an FCC unit while minimizing the increase in coke and Ha byproducts. The invention is directed to these and other important ends.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The present invention is directed to catalytic cracking additives comprising a metals trapping material; and a high activity catalyst. The present invention is directed to processes for the catalytic cracking of feedstock comprising contacting said feedstock under catalytic cracking conditions with a composition comprising a bulk catalyst and a catalytic cracking additive, wherein the catalytic cracking additive comprises a metals trapping material; and a high activity catalyst. The invention is also directed to processes for increasing the performance of a bulk catalyst in the presence of at least one metal comprising contacting a feedstock with a catalytic cracking additive comprising a metals trapping material and a high activity catalyst.<br>
The term "XRD" as used herein means x-ray diffraction.<br>
The term "FCC" as used herein means fluid catalytic cracking.<br>
The term "Re" as used herein means rare earth.<br>
Applicant has surprisingly discovered that the catalytic cracking additives of the invention can increase catalytic conversion but without increased coke or gas production.<br>
Applicant has recognized that catalytic cracking is a two-step process with respect to metal contaminants that can be present in feedstock, wherein 1) metal contaminants are deposited on catalyst particles, along with byproducts including coke, under the riser/reactor conditions in an FCC unit; and 2) catalyst particles containing metals are exposed to steam in order to regenerate the catalyst particles.<br>
Without wishing to be bound by theory, applicant believes that metal contaminants should be removed from the catalyst particles in order to preserve their catalytic abilities. This physical removal of metal contaminants is needed regardless of whether traditional metals passivating agents that can prevent metals contamination of the catalyst particles are present in the riser/reactor. Applicant further believes that metal contaminants are volatile and can migrate within or from catalyst particles in the presence of steam and high<br>
temperature, such as under conditions that are effective to regenerate the catalyst particles. Applicant believes that in the presence of steam and high temperature, the catalytic cracking additives herein can function by preferentially adsorbing volatilized metal contaminants, which had been deposited on the Catalyst particles.<br>

Comparing the Y zeolite XRD peak at about 6.3 degrees shows significantly more diffracted intensity with the high activity catalyst. More diffracted intensity is indicative of the increased crystallinity of the high activity catalyst of the top trace. More diffractive intensity also indicates a higher zeolite content of the high activity catalyst, and can be indicative of the subsequent higher activity of the high activity catalyst.<br>
i)         Zeolites<br>
In one embodiment, the high activity catalyst is a zeolite. In one embodiment, the high activity catalyst is an in situ synthesized zeolite. The zeolites can be stabilized with rare earths, for example, in an amount of from about 0.1 to about 10% by weight. Catalysts including zeolites can contain varying amounts of rare earth compounds. These rare earth compounds can be present during the synthesis of the zeolite, or can be exchanged onto the zeolite following its synthesis. Rare earth-stabilized zeolites are typically denoted "REY".<br>
The zeolites can also be stabilized with steam, including, for example, steam stabilized Y zeolite, known as "USY".<br>
In one embodiment, the zeolite is zeolite X, Y zeolite, zeolite A, zeolite L, zeolite<br>
ZK-4, beta zeolite, faujasite, or a combination thereof. In another embodiment, the high activity catalyst is a large pore zeolite.

In another embodiment, the high activity catalyst is rare-earth stabilized beta zeolite, rare-earth stabilized Y zeolite, rare-earth stabilized faujasite, or a combination thereof.<br>

a)        Feedstock<br>
Any conventional FCC feedstock can be used in the FCC unit. The feedstock can range from the typical, such as petroleum distillates or residual stocks, either virgin or partially refined, to the atypical, such as coal oils and shale oils. The feedstock can<br>
contain recycled hydrocarbons, such as light and heavy cycle oils which have already been subjected to cracking. Exemplary feedstocks include gas oils, vacuum gas oils, atmospheric resids, and vacuum resids.<br>

In one embodiment, the catalytic cracking additives can be added to the riser or regenerator of an FCC unit. In another embodiment, the catalytic cracking additives are added to the regenerator of an FCC unit. In one embodiment, the catalytic cracking additives are added to an FCC unit containing bulk catalyst.<br>
The catalytic cracking additives and bulk catalysts can be introduced into the FCC unit by manually loading via bags or drums. The catalytic cracking additives and bulk catalysts can also be introduced into the FCC unit by automated addition systems, as described, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 5,389,236. To introduce the catalytic cracking additives to an FCC unit, the catalytic cracking additives can be pre-blended with bulk catalysts and introduced into the unit as one system. Alternatively, the catalytic cracking additives and bulk catalysts can be introduced into the FCC unit via separate injection systems.

The base of the riser can comprise a riser catalyst acceleration zone. -In one embodiment, the riser reactor can discharge into a closed cyclone system for rapid and efficient separation of cracked products from spent catalyst.<br>
The additives of the invention can be added to any conventional reactor-regenerator systems, to ebullating catalyst bed systems, to systems which involve continuously conveying or circulating catalysts/additives between reaction zone and regeneration zone and the like. In one embodiment, the system is a circulating bed system. Typical of the circulating bed systems are the conventional moving bed and<br>
fluidized bed reactor-regenerator systems. Both of these circulating bed systems are conventionally used in hydrocarbon conversion (e.g., hydrocarbon cracking) operations. In one embodiment, the system is a fluidized catalyst bed reactor-regenerator system.<br>

c)	Bulk Catalysts<br>
As used herein, the term "bulk catalyst" means any catalyst which can be used for operating an FCC unit under standard catalytic cracking conditions, including those discussed in more detail above.<br>
Any commercially available FCC catalyst can be used as the bulk catalyst. The bulk catalyst can be 100% amorphous, but in one embodiment, can include some zeolite in a porous refractory matrix such as silica-alumina, clay, or the like. The zeolite is usually from about 5 to about 40% of the catalyst by weight, with the rest being matrix or diluent. Conventional zeolites such as Y zeolites, or aluminum deficient forms of these zeolites, such as dealuminized Y, ultrastable Y and ultrahydrophobic Y, can be used. The zeolites can be stabilized with rare earths, for example, in an amount of from about 0.1 to about 10% by weight.<br>
The zeolites that can be used herein include both natural and synthetic zeolites.<br>
Relatively high silica zeolite containing catalysts can be used in the invention.

Examples<br>
The following examples are for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the claims appended hereto.<br><br>
Example 1: Hydrotalcite-like Compounds<br>
Hydrotalcite compounds were prepared following the methods described herein and in U.S. Patent No. 6,028,023.<br>
MgO powder (having a surface area of about 100 m2/g) (MAGOX®, Premier Chemicals, Cleveland, OH) is slurried in water at a solids level of about 14%. Thereafter, 5.2% technical grade acetic acid is added to the MgO slurry.<br>
Separately, pseudoboehmite (P2® Condea) is dispersed in water at a solids level of 8% to produce an alumina sol.<br>
The MgO slurry and alumina sol are mixed in a container such that the molar ratio of Mg/Al of the preparation was 4:1. Additional water is added to the mixture to adjust the solids content of the mixture to about 9%. The mixture is heated to about 214°F over a period of about 5 hours. Once heated, 8 dry basis parts of the resulting slurry was mixed with 2 dry basis parts of technical grade calcium hydroxide along with sufficient water to give a final solids content of about 10%. The mixture is then spray dried under standard conditions to produce microspheroidal particles with an average particle size of about 75-80 microns. The product is then calcined in a rotary calciner at an approximate equivalent temperature of about 600°C for 1 hour. The substance is further hydrated with water to produce a hydrotalcite-like phase. The x-ray diffraction pattern shows that the predominant magnesium aluminum phase was most closely represented by Mg6Al2OHi8-4.5H2O, as depicted in ICDD card 35-965. This substance is referred to herein as "Metals Trap A". The hydrotalcite-like compound is then collapsed by heating at about 500°C until a solids content of about 8% is reached. Attrition resistant microspheres with an ASTM 2 hour attrition of about 2.1, apparent bulk density of about 0.72 g/cc, a surface area of about 65 m2/g, and a pore volume of about 0.45 cc/g were obtained.<br>
Example 2: Silica- and Alumina-containing Compounds<br>
A metals trapping additive containing a calcium oxide active component was prepared by mixing, on an ignited basis, 3 parts calcium hydroxide, 3 parts pseudoboehmite alumina gel, 0.5 parts silica sol and 4 parts kaolin clay. Sufficient excess water was included such that the final solids was approximately 20 weight percent. The resulting slurry was spray dried to an average particle size of about 100 microns and calcined to a final LOI of about 5 weight percent. Attrition resistant microspheres with an ASTM 2 hour attrition of about 1.2, apparent bulk density of about 0.64 g/cc, a surface<br><br>
area of about 60 m2/g, and a pore volume of about 0.54 cc/g were obtained. This substance is referred to herein as "Metals Trap B".<br>
Example 3: Mixed Metal Oxides<br>
Magnesium aluminate was prepared following the methods described herein and in U.S. Patent No. 6,028,023.<br>
MgO powder (having a surface area of about 100 m2/g) (MAGOX®, Premier Chemicals, Cleveland, OH) is slurried in water at a solids level of about 14%. Thereafter, 5.2% technical grade acetic acid is added to the MgO slurry.<br>
Separately, pseudoboehmite (P2® Condea) is dispersed in water at a solids level of 8% to produce an alumina sol.<br>
The MgO slurry and alumina sol are mixed in a container such that the molar ratio of Mg/Al of the preparation was 4: 1 . Additional water is added to the mixture to adjust the solids content of the mixture to about 9%. The mixture is heated to about 214°F over a period of about 5 hours. Once heated, 8 dry basis parts of the resulting slurry was mixed with 2 dry basis parts of technical grade calcium hydroxide along with sufficient water to give a final solids content of about 10%. The mixture is then spray dried under standard conditions to produce microspheroidal particles with an average particle size of about 75-100 microns. The product is then calcined in a rotary calciner at an approximate equivalent temperature of about 600°C for 1 hour to produce a mixed metal oxide of magnesium, calcium and aluminum.<br>
Example 4: Improved FCC Catalyst Performance<br>
To evaluate the performance of the additives, feedstock was catalytically cracked under FCC reactor-like conditions with various bulk catalyst/additive combinations. The bulk catalyst was comparable to commercially available catalysts and formulated with 25% rare earth exchanged Y zeolite in an active matrix of about 30% pseudoboehmite alumina gel and silica sol. The catalyst slurry was spray dried to form microspheroidal particles and then calcined. The catalyst surface area was measured to be about 250 m2/g<br>
and the rare earth content on a ReaOs basis was about 1 .3 wt%. The high activity catalyst used was a Y zeolite prepared via an in situ technique from clay microspheres, available commercially from Engelhard Corporation under the trade name Converter™. The surface area was approximately 400m2/g with a total rare earth content on a Re2Oa basis of about 5%, and the pore volume was about 0.54 cc/g.<br>
Each catalyst mixture (with or without additive components) was first calcined individually at 732°C for one hour and then deactivated according to protocol. Vanadium and nickel naphthanates were cracked onto each specific catalyst mixture using a commercially available automated deactivation unit (Kayser Technologies Model D-100). Then the metal contaminated catalyst was steam treated at 800°C with about 50% steam for about 9 hours. The catalyst mixtures had a final vanadium concentration of about 10,000 ppm and nickel concentration of about 900 ppm. For comparison, a fresh bulk catalyst was also deactivated under the same protocol as the catalyst mixture. An XRD pattern comparison of a bulk catalyst, with and without deactivation, is shown in Figure 2. Figure 2 demonstrates that the deactivation process has a significant impact on the crystal structure of the Y zeolite contained within the bulk catalyst.<br>
To measure catalytic performance, deactivated catalyst mixtures were then loaded into a commercially available, laboratory-scale FCC test unit (Kayser Technology ACE model R+). ACE conditions included a reactor temperature of about 985°F, catalyst to oil ratio of about 7, weighted hourly space velocity of about 8, and using a standard US Gulf Coast feedstock.<br>
In Test Run 1 A, no additive was used. In Test Runs IB-IF, the additive was Metals Trap A as described in Example 1 and/or the high activity catalyst Y Zeolite, sold under the trade name Converter™. In Test Runs 1B-1F, the additive made up 10% of the total catalyst mixture. Performance results for Metals Trap A as the metals trapping material are given in Table 1, below. All data is given as weight percentages.Table 1. FCC Catalyst Performance <br>
(Table Removed)<br>
In Test Runs 2A-2D, conditions were as above for Test Runs 1 A-IF, except that catalyst mixtures had a final vanadium concentration of about 5000 ppm and nickel concentration of 2000 ppm, the catalyst to oil ratio was about 6.0, and using a Mexican Mayan crude feedstock. In Test Run 2A, no additive was used. In Test Runs 2B-2D, the additive was Metals Trap A as described in Example 1 and the high activity catalyst Y Zeolite, sold under the trade name Converter™. In Test Runs 2B-2C, the additive made up 25% of the total catalyst mixture. In Test Run 2D, the additive made up 50% of the total catalyst mixture. Additional performance results for Metals Trap A as the metals trapping material are given in Table 2, below. All data is given as weight percentages.<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
In Test Runs 3A-3F, conditions were as above for Test Runs 1 A-IF, except for the additive. In Test Run 3 A, no additive was used. In Test Runs 3B-3F, the additive was Metals Trap B as described in Example 2 and/or the high activity catalyst Y Zeolite, sold under the trade name Converter™. In Test Runs 3B-3F, the additive made up 10% of the total catalyst mixture. Performance results for Metals Trap B as the metals trapping material are given in Table 3, below. All data is given as weight percentages.<br><br>
TaThe results reported in Tables 1, 2, and 3 demonstrate a synergistic effect from using an additive that contains both a high activity catalyst and a metals trapping material. Essentially no benefit is seen from using the high activity catalyst alone as an additive, but the benefits of high activity catalyst in combination with a metals trapping material in the additive is generally greater than the benefit of metals trapping material alone. The combination of a high activity catalyst and metals trapping material in an additive increases conversion, increases LPG yield, increases gasoline yield, decreases LCO yield, decreases bottoms yield, and decreases coke yield, and decreases hydrogen gas yield.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Example 5: Crystallinity of Fresh Catalysts<br>
Powder x-ray diffraction using Cu Ka radiation and surface area measurements (single point BET) were first taken of the fresh bulk catalyst and fresh high activity catalyst as described in Example 4. These results are given in Table 4, below.<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
The results reported in Table 4 demonstrate the distinction between a bulk catalyst and a high activity catalyst of the present invention. The area of this XRD pattern peak is a metric that generally indicates the degree of crystallinity of a catalyst. The greater the peak area, the more crystalline the catalyst.<br>
Example 6: Mitigate Loss of Bulk Catalyst Crystallinity<br>
To further evaluate the performance of the instant invention, XRD and surface area measurements were taken of FCC catalysts that had been mixed with Metals Trap A and then deactivated.<br>
In Test Run 1 A, no catalytic cracking additive was used. Test Run ID used the catalytic cracking additive Metals Trap A and high activity catalyst of the present invention. The results are given in Table 5 below.<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
The results reported in Table 5 show that the present invention increases the area of the XRD pattern peak at about 6.3 degrees 2-theta. Generally, the area of this XRD<br><br>
pattern peak is a metric that indicates the degree of crystallinity of the bulk catalyst. The greater the peak area, the more crystalline the catalyst. The actual x-ray diffractogram is shown in Figure 3. In Figure 3, the bottom trace shows the diffraction pattern of the fresh, bulk catalyst subjected to no deactivation. Following deactivation, severe loss in crystallinity is observed as shown in the center trace (Test Run 1 A). Upon reacting with a catalytic cracking additive of the present invention (Test Run ID), a significant portion of the crystallinity is preserved as shown in the top trace.<br>
Surface area of the catalyst is another indicator of crystallinity. The results also show that the reduction of the surface area of the bulk catalyst is decreased by catalytic cracking additive of the present invention.<br>
Example 7: Metals Trapping<br>
Scanning Electron Microscopy utilizing Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (SEM/EDS) was performed on the catalytic cracking additives used in Example 4, above.<br>
FCC catalyst/catalytic cracking additive mixtures were deactivated by being metallated and steamed as described in Example 4. The additive particles were found to contain one or more of the following elements: vanadium, sulfur, silicon, cerium.<br>
Various modifications of the invention, in addition to those described herein, will be apparent to one skilled in the art from the foregoing description. Such modifications are understood to fall within the scope of the appended claims.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
