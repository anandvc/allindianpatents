TACHYKININ ANTAGONISTS<br>
The present invention relates to novel compounds having tachykinin antagonist activity, processes for their production, pharmaceutical compositions comprising them and their use as pharmaceuticals.<br>
More particularly the present invention provides a compound of formula I<br><br>
wherein<br>
X	is -CH2-, -CO- or a direct linkage,<br>
Y	is -O-, -S- or -NH-,<br>
 R1       is phenyl,<br>
R2       is hydrogen or phenyl, and<br>
R3       is hydrogen or methyl,<br>
or acid addition salt thereof.<br>
In formula I, the following significances are preferred, individually or in any combination or subcombination:<br>
a)	X is -CO- or a direct linkage, especially -CO-;<br>
b)	Y is -O- or -NH-, especially -NH-;<br>
c)	X is -CO- and Y is -NH-.<br>
d)	R2 is hydrogen;<br><br><br><br><br>
wherein X and Y have the meanings given for formula I and Z' is a leaving group;<br>
b)	for the production of a compound of formula I wherein X is -CO- and Y is -O- or -S-,<br>
reacting a compound of the formula II as defined above with a compound of formula IV<br><br>
wherein Z" is a leaving group and Y' is -O- or -S-; or<br>
c)	for the production of a compound of formula I wherein X is -CO- and Y is -NH-, treating a<br>
compound of formula V<br><br><br>
wherein R1, R2 and R3 have the meanings given for formula I with an alkyl halide; and recovering the compound of formula I thus obtained in free or acid addition salt form.<br>
Suitable leaving groups as Z' for process step a) are halogen or, when X is -CH2- also -NON. Process step (a) may be carried out in accordance with standard procedures, e.g., when Z is halogen in the presence of an acid binding agent, e.g. organic base such as triethylamine, in an inert organic solvent at elevated temperature. Suitably, when Z is halogen this is chlorine. Suitable solvent media include, for example, isopropyl acetate (e.g. when X is -CO-) dioxane (e.g. when X is a direct bond and Y = -O- or -S-), xylene (e.g. when X is a direct bond and Y = -NH-), or isopropanol (e.g. when X is -CH2-), with reaction at temperatures of e.g. from 50' to<br>
80°C up to reflux.<br>
In one variant according to process step (a), X is -CO- and Y is -NH-. In accordance with this variant Z may be halogen, e.g. chlorine. Also R2 may be hydrogen and R3 may be methyl. A procedure for carrying out process step (a) in accordance with this variant is described in Example 7 hereinafter.<br>
For process step (b), suitable leaving groups as Z" include halogen, e.g. chlorine. Reaction may be performed in accordance with conventional procedures, for example, in an inert solvent or diluent such as ethyl acetate, optionally in the presence of an acid binding agent, e.g. organic base such as triethylamine, e.g. at a temperature of from 20 to 70°C.<br><br>
Process step (c) may also be carried out in accordance with conventional procedures, for example, in the presence of methyl iodide in an inert solvent or diluent such as ethyl acetate, e.g. at a temperature of from 10 to 30°C.<br>
Compounds of the formula II may be prepared in accordance with the methods disclosed in International Patent Application No. PCT/EP95/04910 (= Publication no. WO 96/18643 published 20 June 1996 - see, in particular, pages 7 to 9) or as described in Example 7, parts i) and ii) below.<br>

Compounds of formula III wherein X = -CO- and Y = -NH- may also be prepared for example:<br>
(d)	by treating 2,4-dichloroquinazoline, i.e. the compound of fonnula VI<br><br>
with a base for, example alkali metal hydroxide, for example NaOH. Reaction is suitably performed in an aqueous medium, e.g. at temperatures of from 15-25 or 30°C, e.g. as described in Example 7 hereinafter.<br>
Compound VI may in turn be produced, for example:<br>
(e)	by reaction of 2.4-dioxo-1,4-dihydro-quina2oline (or benzoylene urea), i.e. the compound of<br>
formula VII<br><br><br>
with phosphorous oxychloride (POCI3), This process is suitably performed in the presence of an organic base, for example, trialkylamine, e.g. tripropylamine, e.g. at temperatures of from ca. 15oC to reflux, e.g. as also exemplified in Example 7.<br>
Process steps (d) and (e) above are also novel independently or in relation to the synthesis of the corresponding compound of formula I and thus also constitute part of the present invention.<br>

AGENTS OF THE INVENTION are active in displacing [3H] Substance P in the said test method at concentrations of the order of from Ki = about 0.01 to about 10.0 nM.<br><br>
Pharmacological, e.g. analgesic, utility of AGENTS OF THE INVENTION as NK-1 receptor antagonists can also be demonstrated in accordance with standard test models for example as follows:<br>
TEST II: HYPERALGESIA MODEL<br>
The test is performed as described for TEST II in the aforementioned International Patent Publication no. WO 96/18643 at page 28.<br>
'J AGENTS OF THE INVENTION are found to be active In reducing mechanical hyperalgesia in<br>
the said test model at dosages of the order of from 0.1 to about 5.0 mg/kg p.o.. TEST III: NEUROPATHIC HYPERALGESIA MODEL<br>
Guinea pigs are anaesthetised with enflurane in N2O2:O2 (1:1) and peripheral nerve damage is induced by partial ligation of one sciatic nervee. Following recovery from surgery, ligated animals demonstrate clear mechanical hyperalgesia measured, as in the case of TEST 11 employing a Vigo Basile Analgesy meter which develops within 5 days and persists for over 29 days. Groups of 6 animals receive test compound p.o. in the form of a microemulsion compsition as hereinafter described at varying dose, or placebo, 11 to 15 day's  following ligation. Hyperalgesia in groups receiving test compound or placebo is compared and data presented as mean ± S.E.M. and analysed using ANOVA followed by Turkey's HSD test.<br>
AGENTS OF THE INVENTION inhibit mechanical hyperalgesia associated with peripheral nerve ligation in the above test model at doses of the order of from 0.005 to 5.0 mg/kg p.o..<br>
AGENTS OF THE INVENTION are accordingly useful as pharmaceuticals, e.g. as tachykinin, particularly NK-1 (substance P), antagonists, e.g. for the treatment of diseases or clinical conditions characterised by or having an aetiology comprising excessive or undesirable substance-P mediated activity.<br>
In particular they are useful as analgesics or anti-nociceptive agents for the treatment of pain of various genesis or aetiology. They are also useful as anti-inflammatory or anti-oedemic agents for the treatment of inflammatory reactions, diseases or conditions.<br><br>
In relation to their analgesic activity and in contrast with other tachykinin, e.g. NK-1, antagonists known from the art, AGENTS OF THE INVENTION have surprisingly been found to have marked or enhanced activity following oral administration. They have also and in contrast with other tachykinin, e.g. NK-1, antagonists known from the art, been found to have marked antinociceptive action upon the central nervous system following systemic administration, i.e. they readily penetrate the CNS.<br>
Having regard to their analgesic/anti-inflammatory profile, AGENTS OF THE INVENTION are In particular useful for the treatment of Inflammatory pain, hyperalgesia and, especially chronic pain, e.g. severe chronic pain. They are, for example useful for the treatment of pain, inflammation and/or oedema consequential to trauma, e.g. bums, sprain, fracture or the like, as well as surgical intervention, e.g. for the treatment of post-operative pain. They are further useful for the treatment of Inflammatory pain of diverse genesis, e.g. for the treatment of pain associated with arthritis Including rheumatoid and osteo-arthritis and rheumatic diesease, tenosynovitis, vasculitis, and rheumatic joint pain, e.g. rheumatid arthritis, as well as for the treatment of gout.<br>
AGENTS OF THE INVENTION are further useful for the treatment of diabetic neuropathy pain and pain associated with angina, renal or billiary colic and menstruation.<br>
AGENTS OF THE INVENTION are also useful for the treatment of migraine and of pain associated with migraine. They are further useful as anti-emetic agents, for the treatment of emesis, e.g. emesis consequential to chemotherapy, poisons, pregnancy or migraine, and irritable bowel syndrome as well as for the treatment of incontinence and gastrointestinal disorder such as retard emptying of the stomach, dyspepsia, esophageal reflux and flatulence.<br>
AGENTS OF THE INVENTION are further indicated for use in the treatment of chronic or obstructive airways disease, e.g. for the control or prevention of bronchial oedema, pulmonary mucosal secretion or airways hyperreactivity, e.g. for use as therapeutic or prophylactic agents in the treatment of asthma. AGENTS OF THE INVENTION are indicated for use for the treatment of atopic and non-atopic asthma, e.g. for the treatment of allergic asthma, exercise induced asthma, occupational asthma, asthma following bacterial infection and drug-induced, e.g. asprin induced, asthma as well as of wheezy infant syndrome.<br><br>
Further such inflammatory or obstructive airways diseases include pneumoconiosis (an inflammatory, commonly occupational, disease of the lungs, frequently accompanied by repeated inhalation of dusts) of whatever type or genesis, including, for example, aluminosis, anthracosis, asbestosis, chalicosis, ptilosis, siderosis, silicosis, tabacosis and, in particular, byssinosis.<br>
Yet further inflammatory or obstructive airways diseases and conditions for which use of AGENTS OF THE INVENTION is indicated include adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), chronic obstructive pulmonary or airways disease (COPD or COAD), and bronchitis. AGENTS OF THE INVENTION further useful for the treatment of rhinitis, e.g. for the treatment of allergic and vasomotor rhinitis.<br>
AGENTS OF THE INVENTION are further Indicated for use in the treatment of<br>
- disorders of the central nervous system, in particular anxiety states, for example in the treatment of anxiety, depression, psychosis, schizophrenia, panic attack, phobias such as agrophobia, stress related somatic disorders and addiction disorders such as alcoholism or cocaine abuse;<br>
neurodegenerative disorders such as dementia, including senile dementia, Alzheimer's disease and Down's syndrome;<br>
demyelinating diseases such as MS, ALS and other neuropathological disorders, for example peripheral neuropathy, e.g. diabetic and chemotherapy induced neuropathy;<br>
AGENTS OF THE INVENTION are yet further indicated for use in the treatment of diseases or conditions associated with dysfunction of the immune system, e.g. autoimmune diseases, in particular where these are associated with inflammatory, oedemic or nociceptive event. Particular diseases or conditions in this category include, for example autoimmune haematological disorders (including e.g. haemolytic anaemia, aplastic anaemia, pure red cell anaemia and idiopathic thrombocytopenia), systemic lupus erythematosus, polychondritis, sclerodoma, Wegener granulamotosis, dermatomyositis, chronic active hepatitis, myasthenia gravis, psoriasis, Steven-Johnson syndrome, idiopathic sprue, autoimmune inflammatory bowel<br><br>
disease (including e.g. ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease) endocrine ophthalmopathy, Graves disease, sarcoidosis, multiple sclerosis, primary billiary cirrhosis, juvenile diabetes (diabetes mellitus type I), uveitis (anterior and posterior), keratoconjunctivitis sicca and vernal keratoconjunctivitis, interstitial lung fibrosis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and glomerulonephritis (with and without nephrotic syndrome, e.g. including idiopathic nephrotic syndrome or minimal change nephropathy) as well as vasculitis. AGENTS OF THE INVENTION may also be useful as immuno-suppressant or immunosuppressive adjuvants, e.g. for use in conjunction with other immunosuppressive, e.g. cyclosporin or immunosuppressive macrolide therapy, for the suppression of allograft rejection, for example following allogenic e.g. allogenic kidney, liver, comeal, heart, lung or heart-lung transplantation.<br>
AGENTS OF THE INVENTION are yet further indicated for use in the treatment of allergic diseases or conditions, e.g. of the skin, eye, naso-pharynx or gastro intestinal tract, in particular where such disease or condition is associated with inflammatory, oedemic or nociceptive reactions. Examples of such diseases or conditions include, for example, exzema, hypersensitivity disorders such as poison ivy allergy, contact dermatitis, conjunctivitis, vernal conjunctivitis, keratoconjunctivitis sicca, urticaria and other eczemoid dermatoses,<br>
AGENTS OF THE INVENTION are also useful in the treatment of disorders of blood flow caused by vasodilation and vasospastic diesease such as angina, migraine and Raynaud's disease.<br>
In addition to the foregoing AGENTS OF THE INVENTION have also been found to possess P-glycoprotein blocking activity. AGENTS OF THE INVENTION are accordingly further indicated for use as adjuvant or co-therapy with drug substances of other therapeutic category for example:<br>
- for increasing or enhancing effectiveness of, or increasing or enhancing sensitivity to, other chemotherapeutic drug therapy, in particular anti-microbial (e.g. anti-bacterial, anti-viral, antifungal or anti-protozoal) chemotherapy, chemotherapy for AIDS and. especially, anticancer or anti-tumor (e.g. anti-neoplastic or cytostatic) chemotherapy. They are accordingly indicated for use, e.g. as a means of reducing regular chemotherapeutic dosage levels, for example, in the case of anti-neoplastic or cytostatic drug therapy, as a means of decreasing<br><br>
overall drug toxicity and, more especially, as a means of reversing or reducing resistance.<br>
including both inherent and acquired resistance, to chemotherapy;<br>
to enable or potentiate other drug therapy directed at the central nervous system, e.g. to<br>
enhance drug penetration of the blood-brain barrier, for example to enable, increase or<br>
enhance other psychotropic drug therapy, e.g. for administration in conjunction with other<br>
analgesic or psychomotor stimulatory or depressant agents or agents, for example, for<br>
treatment of neurodegenerative disease including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease<br>
and so forth as well as chemotherapy to be directed at tumor of the brain;<br>
as antiparasitic, particularly antiprotozoic, agents, e.g., particularly against organisms of the<br>
genera Toxoplasma (e.g.. Toxoplasma gondii) and Plasmodia (e.g., Plasmodium<br>
falciparum).<br>
For the above indications the dosage of AGENTS OF THE INVENTION will, of course, vary depending upon, for example, the host, the mode of administration and the nature and severity of the condition being treated as well as the relative potency of the particular AGENT OF THE INVENTION employed. However, in general, satisfactory results in animals, e.g. for the treatment of pain, migraine and emesis, are indicated to be obtained at dosages of from about 0.005 or 0.1 to about 5.0 mg/kg p.o.. In larger mammals, for example humans, an indicated daily dosage is in the range of from about 0.35 or 7.0 to about 350.0 mg/day p.o., e.g. ca. 1,10,100 or 200 mg/day p.o. conveniently administered once or in divided doses up to 4 x per day or in sustained release form. Oral dosage forms accordingly suitably comprise from about 0.1 or 3.5 to about 350 mg, e.g.'about 0.25, 2.5, 25, 50, 100 or 200 mg AGENT OF THE INVENTION admixed with an appropriate phamiaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier therefor.<br>
AGENTS OF THE INVENTION may altematively be administered, e.g. topically in the fonn of a cream, gel or the like for example for the treatment of conditions of the skin as hereinbefore described or by inhalation, e.g. in dry powder form, for example for the treatment of obstructive or inflammatory ainvays disease, or by any other appropriate route, e.g by injection or infusion.<br>
Pharmaceutical dosage forms as aforesaid can be manufactured employing known excipients and by methods commonly used in the art.<br>
■ * For oral administration AGENTS OF THE INVENTION are suitably formulated as a<br>
microemulsion preconcentrate, i.e. a form ulation which, on addition to water, provides a<br><br>
microemulsion. Such microemulsion preconcentrates will generally comprise a hydrophilic phase (e.g. propylene glycol and/or ethanol), a hydrophobic phase (e.g. a vegetable oil mono-di-triglyceride such as commercially available under the registered trade mark MAISINE or as described in UK Patent Publication No. 2 284 615), and a surfactant (e.g. a polyoxyhydrogenated vegetable oil such as commercially available under the registered trademark CREMOPHOR e.g., CREMOPHOR RH40). The following example is illustrative of the preparation of galenic forms suitable for oral administration:<br><br>
&gt;<br>
The preferred AGENT OF THE INVENTION is the product of EXAMPLE 6. In one series of experiments an established D30 for this compound in free base form and formulated as a microemulsion as hereinbefore described in TEST II above is ca. 0.45 mg/kg/p.o. at 3 hrs, respectively. A determined D30 for aspirin in the same test method is of the order of 56.0 mg/kg/p.o.. Indicated oral dosages for the said compound as an analgesic agent will thus be of the order of 1/130th. of those clinically employed using asprin.<br>
