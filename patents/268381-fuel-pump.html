[Title of Document] Specification [Title of the Invention]  FUEL PUMP [Technical Field] [0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a fuel pump mounted on a vehicle such as a motorcycle. [Background Art] [0002]<br>
An in-tank type fuel pump, which is provided at the bottom of a fuel tank and driven in a state immersed in fuel, is common among fuel pumps constituting fuel feeding devices for this type of vehicle. In this type of fuel pump, a pump part is arranged at the lower part inside a cylindrical case body, a motor part for driving the pump part is arranged at the upper part inside the case body, and the fuel can be stably fed to the fuel tank even if the fuel accumulated in the fuel tank is reduced. [0003]<br>
An electric motor is often employed as the motor part used for the fuel pump, the electric motor supplying external power via brushes made to slidably contact with a commutator provided around a motor shaft, thereby rotating the motor shaft. In such a fuel pump, a fuel discharging part is provided on the motor part side (Patent Document 1).<br>
In a case where the fuel pump employing such a motor part is built in the in-tank type fuel feeding device, because the fuel discharging part is provided directed upward, piping<br><br>
connected to the fuel discharging part is pulled out from the inside to the outside of the fuel tank and is guided to an engine side (Patent Document 2).<br>
[Patent Document 1] Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application No. HlO-47291<br>
[Patent Document 2] Patent Publication No. 2003/044357 [Disclosure of the Invention] [Problem(s) to be Solved by the Invention] [0004]<br>
However, in the conventional fuel pump, a fuel discharging part is provided on a motor part side, a flow path of fuel sucked in the case body flows through the inside of the case body of the fuel pump, namely, between a rotor constituting the motor part and the case body, and reaches a bracket of the motor part side. Thus, the flow path of the fuel is required to be secured between permanent magnets arranged around the inner circumference of the case body and the outer circumference of the rotor. Accordingly, limitations arise for making the motor part compact, and making the fuel pump compact.<br>
Additionally, when the fuel pump including such a motor part is built in an in-tank type fuel feeding device, the fuel discharging part is arranged in a fuel tank directed upward. Therefore, piping guided from the fuel discharging part to an engine side is required to be pulled out from the upper part in the fuel tank and to be drawn around toward the engine side. And thus, the fuel flow path becomes long owing to passing<br><br>
through the inside and outside of the fuel tank, and pressure loss is increased. Accordingly, power of the fuel pump is required to be increased and this causes a problem that making the fuel pump compact is prevented. In addition, since the piping for making the inside of the fuel tank communicate with the outside thereof is required, the number of parts is increased, the fuel feeding device is made large, and the structure thereof is complicated. These problems are to be solved by the present invention. [Means for Solving the Problem(s)] [0005]<br>
In order to solve the above problems, the present invention has been carried out. In the invention of the first aspect, there is provided a fuel pump provided at the bottom of a fuel tank including: a pump part installed in a lower part inside the case body; and a motor part which is installed in an upper part inside the case body and drives the pump part, wherein a fuel sucking part for sucking fuel into the pump part and a fuel discharging part for discharging the fuel outside of the pump part are provided on the pump part side inside the case body in a vertical direction.<br>
In the invention of the second aspect according to the first aspect, the fuel pump is supported inside the fuel tank via a pump stay, and in the pump stay, the fuel feeding part communicating with the fuel tank, being positioned lower than the bottom of the fuel tank, and accumulating and feeding the fuel to the fuel sucking part is formed-<br><br>
In the invention of the third aspect according to the second aspect^ a fuel filter is provided in the fuel feeding part, and the fuel fed from the fuel tank is filtrated and accumulated in the fuel feeding part.<br>
In the invention of the fourth aspect according to either one of the second or third aspect, a guiding path for guiding the fuel discharged from the fuel discharging part outside is provided in the pump stay.<br>
In the invention of the fifth aspect according to any one of the second to fourth aspects, a coupler part connected to an external power supply is formed in the pump stay so as to be projected under the bottom of the fuel tank.<br>
In the invention of the sixth aspect according to any one of the first to fifth aspects, the motor part is constituted by a brush type electric motor. [Effects of the Invention] [0006]<br>
By the invention of the first aspect, a fuel pump can be made compact, piping to an engine side is shortened, and the constitution of the fuel pump can be simplified.<br>
By the invention of the second aspect, the number of parts is reduced and the constitution of the fuel pump is simplified. Additionally, fuel can be stably and reliably fed to the fuel pump.<br>
By the invention of the third aspect, it is unnecessary to provide space for a fuel filter, a large fuel filter can be used, and a further excellent pump can be realized.<br><br>
By the invention of the fourth aspect, a flow path to the engine side can be simplified, and a fuel feeding device can be miniaturized.<br>
By the invention of the fifth aspect, the constitution of the fuel feeding device can be further simplified, and it can be made compact.<br>
[Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention] [0007]<br>
Next, embodiments of the present invention will be described hereinafter with reference to the drawings.<br>
In the drawings, the reference symbol 1 denotes a fuel pump constituting a fuel feeding device. The fuel pump 1 attached to a fuel tank 2 described below is constituted by a pump part P positioned at the lower part on the side of a bottom 2a of the fuel tank 2 and a motor part M positioned above the pump part P, The motor part M and the pump part P include a cylindrical yoke 3 constituting the case body of the present invention, an upper side step part 3a is provided in a cylindrical end surface of an upper end of the yoke 3, and an outer circumferential edge of an ring-shaped upper side bracket 4 constituting an upper end of the case body is caulked on the upper side step part 3a-[0008]<br>
The reference symbol 5 denotes an armature constituting the motor part M, and an upper end of an armature shaft (motor shaft) 5a constituting the armature 5 is rotatably borne by a bearing part 4a caved in a shaft center part of the upper<br><br>
side bracket 4. Further, a commutator 6 is integrally fitted onto the upper end of the armature shaft 5a, and is constituted by a plurality of conductive commutator pieces 6b provided on an outer circumferential surface of a ring-shaped part 6a made of resin in a circumferential direction. On the other hand, a pair of brush holders 4b is integrally formed on a lower end surface of the upper side bracket 4 in the circumference direction. Each of brush holders 4b has brush 7 energized to the inner diameter side, and an inner diameter side top end surface of the brush 7 is compressively brought into contact with the commutator piece 6b. Additionally, a plurality of ring-shaped core materials 5b are integrally fitted onto the lower part of an outer fitting part of the commutator 6 of the armature shaft 5a, a plurality of coils 5c conductive to the predetermined commutator pieces 6b respectively are wound around the outer circumference of these integrated core materials 5b, and the armature 5 is thereby constituted.<br>
Moreover, the reference symbol 8 denotes a pair of permanent magnets fixed to an inner circumferential surface of the yoke 3 facing the armature 5 at a predetermined interval in the circumferential direction, and inner circumferential surfaces of the permanent magnets 8 are made closely facing the outer circumference of the armature 5. [0009]<br>
Further, a lower end 5d of the armature shaft 5a penetrates a through hole 9a opened in a shaft center part of a ring-shaped lower side bracket 9 fixed to a lower end of the<br><br>
yoke 3 to constitute the pump part P, and is rotatably supported by a bearing 9b arranged in the through hole 9a. Additionally, as described below, each coil 5c is excited via the coirmiutator piece 6b by supplying external power to the brush 7, and thus the armature 5 is made to rotate inside of the yoke 3 polarized by the permanent magnets 8. [0010]<br>
An outer circumferential edge of the lower side bracket 9 arranged in a downwardly butting state, and the outer circumferential edge and an outer circumferential edge of a pump bracket 10 constituting the lower end of the case body of the present invention are caulked by an lower side step part 3b formed in the yoke 3. The pump part P is constituted by the lower side bracket 9 and the pump bracket 10.<br>
A recessed part 9c, of which a lower part opens, is formed at the lower surface of the lower side bracket 9, and the pump bracket 10 is made to butt against the outer circumferential edge, which is on outer diameter side of the recessed part 9c, of the lower side bracket 9 so that a pump chamber PR is formed between the lower side bracket 9 and the pump bracket 10. The lower end 5d of the armature shaft 5a, which penetrates the through hole 9a of the lower side bracket 9 to be projected downward, is projected into the pump chamber PR, and an impeller 11, of which an outer circumferential edge has a blade part 11a, is key-fitted with the projected lower end 5d so as to be penetration-supported in a nonrotatable state. Thus, the impeller 11 rotates with driving of the motor part M.<br><br>
Additionally, a ring-shaped recessed part 9d, which faces the blade 11a of the impeller 11 and is a flow path of the fuel, is formed on the outer diameter side of the recessed part 9c of the lower side bracket 9, and a motor part side discharging part 9e, which communicates with the ring-shaped recessed part 9d to penetrate in a vertical direction and makes the motor part M communicate with the pump part P, is opened. On the other hand, a recessed part 10a, with which the lower end 5d of the armature shaft 5a is loosely fitted, is formed on an upper surface of the pump bracket 10, the lower end 5d projecting into the pump chamber PR and supporting the impeller 11 in the nonrotatable state. Further a ring-shaped recessed part 10b, which faces the blade 11a (lower side bracket ring-shaped recessed part 9d) of the impeller 11 and is the flow path of the fuel, is formed on the upper surface of the pump bracket 10. Furthermore, a cylindrical hole-shaped fuel sucking part 10c for sucking the fuel is formed which penetrates in the vertical direction by communicating with the ring-shaped recessed part 10b and sucks the fuel, and a cylindrical hole-shaped fuel discharging part lOd is formed on the position in another circumferential direction of the fuel sucking part 10c, the fuel discharging part lOd penetrating in the vertical direction by communicating with the ring-shaped recessed part 10b and projecting downward to discharge the fuel outside.<br>
The reference symbol 12 denotes a check valve formed on the fuel discharaina part lOd.  The check valve 12 includes<br><br>
a cylindrical valve body with bottom 12a and a spherical valve element 12c which seals a through hole 12b opened in a bottom positioned at the upper part of the valve body 12a. When the pressure of the fuel discharged from the fuel discharging part lOd reaches a predetermined pressure, the valve element 12c opens the through hole 12b of the valve body 12a and the fuel is discharged to a discharge-guiding path 13g side described below. Moreover, the check valve 12 is arranged movably in the fuel discharging part lOd in the vertical direction and serves as a relief valve. When the temperature of the fuel in the piping connected to the discharge-guiding path 13g side increases and the pressure of the fuel increases, the valve body 12a is displaced upward so that the pressure of the fuel of the discharge-guiding path 13g side is reduced. [0012]<br>
On the other hand, a ring-shaped through hole 2b is opened in the bottom 2a of the fuel tank 2, and the through hole 2b is designed to be sealed by a pump stay unit (corresponding to a pump stay of the present invention) 13. The pump stay unit 13 is provided with a function for the fuel pump 1 in the fuel tank 2.<br>
That is, a cylindrical part with bottom 13a is formed at the lower part of the pump stay unit 13, and on a cylindrical outer circumferential surface of the cylindrical part with bottom 13a, flange part 13b projected to the outer diameter side is formed. The flange part 13b is made to butt against and fix to the fuel tank through hole 2b so that the fuel tank<br><br>
through hole 2b is covered with the cylindrical part with bottom 13a in a sealed state. In this state, the cylindrical part with bottom 13a is arranged so as to be projected under the fuel tank 2.<br>
Further, in the pump stay unit 13, a plurality of stay pieces 13c are integrally formed which are positioned above the flange part 13b and extended upward from an upper side cylinder end edge of the cylindrical part with bottom 13a for fitting into the fuel tank 2 at a predetermined interval in the circumferential direction, and a fixing piece 13d bent to the inner diameter side is integrally formed on each upper end of the stay piece 13c. The fixing pieces 13d are fixed to the upper side bracket 9 of the fuel pump 1 arranged at the bottom of the fuel tank 2 so that the pump stay unit 13 supports the fuel pump 1 with the stay pieces 13c closely facing the yoke 3- Thus, the fuel pump 1, in which the pump part P is positioned at the lower side, is fixed and supported to the fuel tank 2 with an erected posture. [0013]<br>
Additionally, a step part 13e of which the lower side has a smaller diameter is formed on an inner circumferential surface of the cylindrical part with bottom 13a, which is projected outside (downward) from the fuel tank 2, of the pump stay unit 13, a disc-shaped partitioning plate 14 is fixed to the step part 13e in a sealing and butting state, and the partitioning plate 14 partitions the inside of the cylindrical part with bottom 13a into an upper part and lower part.  Here,<br><br>
the partitioning plate 14 is arranged so as to be positioned lower than the bottom 2a of the fuel tank 2, and so as to face the pump bracket 10 of the fuel pump 1 supported by the stay pieces 13c and fixing pieces 13d in an erected state.<br>
A fuel filter 15 is provided on the partitioning plate 14. The fuel, which flows from the upper side of the partitioning plate 14 into the cylindrical part with bottom 13a side via the through hole 2b of the fuel tank bottom 2a/ is made to flow downward via the fuel filter 15 provision portion. Thus, the lower part of the inside of the cylindrical part with bottom 13a partitioned by the partitioning plate 14 forms into a fuel feeding part 13f for accumulating the fuel filtrated by the fuel filter 15. [0014]<br>
A cylindrical guiding path for sucking 14a facing the fuel sucking part 10c is projected upward on an outer diameter side part of the partitioning plate 14 facing the pump bracket 10. The guiding path for sucking 14a is formed so as to communicate with the fuel feeding part 13f via a through hole 14b opened in the partitioning plate 14, and a projecting top end of the guiding path for sucking 14a is fitted into the cylindrical fuel sucking part 10c of the fuel pump 1 side in a sealing manner so that the guiding path for sucking 14a is connected to the fuel sucking part 10c. Thereby, the filtrated fuel accumulated in the fuel feeding part 13f is fed into the fuel sucking part 10c via the guiding path for sucking 14a of the rotation of the impeller 11 of the fuel pump 1.<br><br>
Further, a through hole for discharge 14c positioned at the place facing the fuel discharging part lOd of the pump bracket 10 is formed on the outer diameter side of the partitioning plate 14. The through hole for discharging 14c is constituted by a through hole penetrating the partitioning plate 14 in the vertical direction, and the fuel discharging part lOd of the fuel pump 1 side penetrates the through hole 14c in a sealing manner. A penetrating top end of the fuel discharging part lOd fitted into the through hole for discharging 14c is fitted into the discharge-guiding path (corresponding to the guiding path of the present invention) 13g formed in the cylindrical part with bottom 13a in a sealing manner. The discharge-guiding path 13g is partitioned from the fuel feeding part 13f formed on the cylindrical part with bottom 13a, is formed adjacent to the fuel feeding part 13f, is formed so as to be extended from the bottom side of the cylindrical part with bottom 13a toward the outer diameter side thereof, and piping (not shown) from the engine side is connected to an extended end of the discharge-guiding path 13g. [0015]<br>
Additionally, a coupler part 13h, to which an external coupler (not shown) is connected and via which the external power is inputted, is formed integrally in an outer circumference part of the cylindrical part with bottom 13a of the pump stay unit 13 exposed from the fuel tank 2 and lower than the fuel tank bottom 2a. The external power inputted via the coupler part 13h is supplied to the brushes 7 arranged on<br><br>
the upper side bracket 4 of the fuel pump 1 via an L-shaped first terminal plate 16 implanted in the coupler part 13h, a conductive plate 16a disposed in a vertical direction^ and a second terminal plate 16b. [0016]<br>
Further, in the fuel pump 1 of the embodiment, a pressure adjusting unit 17 as air ventilation means is provided on the upper side bracket 4 constituting the motor part M. When the pressure in the fuel pump 1 reaches a predetermined pressure, the pressure adjusting unit 17 discharges the fuel in the fuel pump 1 to the fuel tank 2 side, adjusts the pressure in the fuel pump 1, and the air which enters the fuel pump 1 can be vented out to the outside.<br>
The pressure adjusting unit 17 is provided in a recessed hole 4c formed in a recessed groove shape downward from the upper side surface of the upper side bracket 4, and includes a spherical valve element 17a for sealing a through hole 4d opened in a groove bottom surface of the recessed hole 4c to make the inside of the fuel pump 1 communicate with the inside of the fuel tank 2 and a spring 17b for compressing and energizing the valve element 17a so as to make the valve element 17a close the through hole 4d. When the pressure exceeding the energizing force of the spring 17b is generated in the motor part M, the valve element 17c is released, and the fuel in the yoke 3 is discharged to the fuel tank 2 side via the through hole 4d.<br><br>
In the thus constituted fuel pump 1, when the power is supplied to the brushes 7 from the external coupler (not shown) connected to the coupler part 13h via the first terminal plate 16, the conductive plate 16a and the second terminal plate 16b, the armature shaft 5a rotates and the impeller 11 of the pump part P integrally rotates with this rotation. Thus, the fuel, which is fed from the fuel tank 2 and accumulated in the fuel feeding part 13f in a filtrated condition, is sucked into the pump part P via the fuel sucking part 10c. The sucked fuel flows through the lower side bracket ring-shaped recessed part 9d and the pump bracket ring-shaped recessed part 10b, which are formed at the part facing the impeller blade 11a, is guided to the motor part side discharging part 9e of the upper side bracket 9 and the fuel discharging part lOd of the pump bracket 10, and is guided to the engine side through the fuel guiding path 13g. In this case, the pressure adjusting unit 17 is closed. When the pressure in the fuel pump 1 becomes higher, the pressure adjusting unit 17 opens and discharges the fuel to the engine tank 2 side, thereby the pressure in the fuel pump 1 is properly adjusted. [0018]<br>
Then, in this case, the fuel accumulated in the fuel feeding part 13f moves in a part, from the fuel sucking part 10c formed in the pump bracket 10 of the pump part P to the fuel discharging part lOd, as a flow path, and no fuel flow path is formed between the inner circumferential surface of the yoke 3 (permanent magnets 8) of the motor part M and the<br><br>
armature 5. Thus, a gap between the inner circumferential surface of the yoke 3 (permanent magnets 8) of the motor part M and the armature 5 can be made as small as possible. Additionally, since the fuel flow path is provided in only the pump part P, pressure loss can be reduced. Further, since the fuel discharging part lOd is guided to the engine side via the fuel guiding path 13g arranged adjacently to the fuel feeding part 13f of the pump stay unit 13, a complicated constitution, of a conventional fuel feeding device is unnecessary, such that piping from the fuel discharging part to the engine side is pulled out from the fuel tank in the sealed state, and the fuel feeding device can be made compact. [0019]<br>
In the fuel pump 1 constituting the fuel feeding device of the embodiment thus constituted, the brushes 7 are slidably brought into contact with the commutator 6 provided around the armature shaft 5a, and the outer circumference of the armature 5 is close to the inner circumferential surfaces of the permanent magnets 8 provided on the inner circumferential surface of the yoke 3. In this case, since the fuel sucking part 10c is formed in the vertical direction in the pump bracket 10 of the pump part P, which is provided in an erecting state and positioned on the lower side inside the fuel pump 1, the fuel pump 1 can effectively suck the fuel in the fuel tank 2. Additionally, since the fuel discharging part lOd is also formed in the pump bracket 10, it is unnecessary to form a flow pai:h inside of the yoke 3,  namely between the inner<br><br>
circumferential surface of the yoke 3, to which the permanent magnets 8 are fixed, and the outer circumferential surface of the armature 5, although the motor part M is filled with fuel, and thus the outer circumference of the armature 5 is made close to the inner circumferential surface of the yoke 3. Accordingly, the fuel pump 1 can be made compact.<br>
Further, in the fuel pump 1, since the fuel discharging part lOd is formed on the pump part P side (lower part of the fuel pump 1) , it is unnecessary to provide the piping constitution which penetrates from the inside of the fuel tank 2 to the outside thereof in order to form the flow path to the engine side. Furthermore, since the fuel flow path from the fuel discharging part lOd to the engine side can be shortened, not only can the number of parts be reduced but also the pressure loss can be reduced. Accordingly, the fuel feeding device can be further made compact, and the fuel tank 2 can also be made compact.<br>
Moreover, since the pressure adjusting unit 17 is provided within the diameter of the pump part P, the fuel pump can be made further compact. [0020]<br>
In the embodiment of the present invention, the fuel pump 1 is supported inside the fuel tank 2 via the stay pieces 13c and the fixing pieces 13d of the pump stay unit 13. In this case, the cylindrical part with bottom 13a, which covers the through hole 2b of the bottom 2a of the fuel tank 2 in the sealing manner and is positioned lower than the fuel tank bottom 2a<br><br>
in the pump stay unit 13, is formed in the pump stay unit 13, and the fuel feeding part 13f for accumulating the fuel to be fed to the fuel sucking part 10c of the fuel pump 1 is formed on the cylindrical part with bottom 13a. Thereby, it is unnecessary to provide a stay member for supporting the fuel pump 1 separately from the fuel feeding part, the number of parts can be reduced, and the constitution of the fuel pump can be simplified. Additionally, since the fuel feeding part 13f is positioned lower than the fuel tank 2, the fuel can be fed to the fuel pump 1 without impact of a change in an oil level in the fuel tank 2 and can be reliably fed to the fuel pump 1 even if the fuel in the fuel tank 2 decreases, and stable feeding of the fuel can be realized. Additionally, the amount of available fuel in the fuel tank 2 can be increased, and the fuel tank 2 can be further miniaturized. [0021]<br>
Further, since the fuel filter 15 is formed in the fuel feeding part 13f and the fuel fed from the fuel tank 2 is accumulated in the fuel feeding part 13f in a filtrated condition, it is unnecessary to secure space for constituting the fuel filter 15, the fuel filter 15 can be made larger in accordance with the size of the fuel feeding part 13f, and a further excellent fuel pump can be obtained. [0022]<br>
Furthermore, since the fuel guiding path 13g as the flow path, through which the fuel discharged from the fuel discharging part lOd flows, is formed integrally with the pump<br><br>
stay unit 13, the piping as the flow path to the engine side can be easily provided, the constitution of the fuel pump can be simplified, and the fuel feeding device can be miniaturized. [0023]<br>
Additionally, the coupler part 13h connected to the external coupler for supplying the external power to the brushes 7 is formed integrally with the pump stay unit 13, the constitution of the fuel feeding device can be further simplified, and the fuel feeding device can be made compact. [0024]<br>
Moreover, as a matter of course, the present invention is not limited to the above embodiment, and a brushless type electric motor may be employed as the motor part. In this case, the distance between the inner circumferential surface of a stator coil and the outer circumferential surface of the rotor, where arranged inside the yoke, can be reduced, the fuel pump can be made compact, and the fuel flow path can be shortened.
