				<td>This  invention relates to a formulation  for iron-chelation The  formulation of the present invention is useful for  treating patients suffering from the disease of Thalassemia .<br>
This invention relates particularly to a formulation useful fat  the  treatment of patients suffereing from  the  disease  of Thalassemia with increased therapeutic efficacy.<br>
Thalassemia  is a dreaded disease among children because  of genetic  disorder.  The  disease  is  caused  due  to  hereditary disorders   connected  with  defective   haemoglobin   synthesis, characterised  by  hypochromia, microcytosis,  haemolysis  and  a variable  degree of anaemia. Thalassemia involves a  heterogeneous group  of molecular defects and  present with a wide spectrum  of clinical expressions.<br>
Patients sufferening form Thalassemia suffer from anaemias with decreased or absence  of  synthesis of a globin chain of a normal haemoglobin. The patients of thalassemia  are broadly  classified into two major groups according to the affected globin chain. The patients suffereing form Alpha (<a thalassemia are associated with decreased or absence of g synthesis. the patients sufferening foprra beta></a>
Rarely one may find also patients suffereing form Thalassemia delta (£) and Gamma (V) chain disorders, as well as those associated abnormal hamoglobin structure (e.g. Hb Lepose and Hb Constant Spring) . Such types of disease which also contribute to the Thalassemia syndromes.<br>
The  disease Thalassemia occurs world wide with a  particular high  incidence in the Mediterranean basin and in the  South-East<br><br>
Asia. Malaria is also endemic in these areas - a significant fact since indirect evidence suggests that- Thaiassemia (major) heter-ozygosity confers protection against malaria.<br>
The P -Thaiassemia or Thaiassemia major type of the  disease<br>
comprises a heterogeneous group of disorder usually characterised<br>
0	+<br>
by absence  of (P ) or decreased (P ) globin synthesis.<br>
The type of P Thaiassemia is also classified according to the severity of the anaemia. These clinical classification serves to differentiate homozygous (Thaiassemia intermedia or Thaiassemia. major) from heterozygous state {Thaiassemia minima or Thaiassemia minor). Though it does not reflect genetic mutations, Thaiassemia (minor) is a reduced rate of P -globin synthesis, with an increased d-p globin chains, but it not threat to a normal life<br>
In case of Thaiassemia (major) also known as Cooley's anaemia, Mediterranean anaemia and Von - Jacksch*s anaemia is characterised by marked anaemia (ranging from 1 to 6 gm/dl of hamoglobin), severe hemolysis and ineffective erthropoiresis. The diagnosis is made in the 1st year of the life of the patient, often as early as 3 months old baby. In the case of Thaiassemia (major), iron in the haemoglobin also breaks down and gets deposited in the vital organs of the body of the patients e.g. liver, kidney, spleen etc. This is also known as iron overloading in the body and the life span of the child suffering from Thaiassemia (major) becomes unpredictable. Every year out of i,00,OOO children born with Thaiassemia (major) in the world, 10,000 are born in India.<br>
The method which is available hitherto for the treatment of<br><br>
Thalassemia (major) is by the life long blood transfusion coupled with the taking of the drug called 'Desferal' daily intermuscula-ry. The chemical name of the drug is Deferoxamine Methane Sulpho-<br>
nate and the chemical formula is C  H  NO  S.<br>
28 52 4 11 Presently  followed therapy is giving injection of  Desferal  for<br>
the excretion of iron from the body of the patient through urinay excretion. It was found by medical profession that Desferal had many side effects like swelling of limbs, stiffness in joints and may inhibit a. number of tumour eel 1 prol iferation .parasite growth and the proliferation of the cerebral Malarial Parasite, Plasmod-<br>
_--£	^^<br>
ium (Fal i parura.)<br>
In addition , the above drug is to be injected daily under the skin of the patient in a controlled manner in such a way to avoid any side reaction causing allergic conditions .Such a treatment is M highly painful . The treatment is also costly as the vial containing 500 mg of dry active substance will cost Rs ISO/ each. Though a new oral iron chelating drug known as L-1,CP20,DMPH, Deferiprone (Chemical Name,1,2 Dimethyl 3 Hydroxyp-yridine 4-one ) has been reported very recently .It is yet to establish its potentiality of patients suffereing from the disease of Thalassemia . The reported side effects of this drug are 1. Myelotoxicity ie occurance of neutropenia 2. Orthropathy ie skeleto muscular pain and swelling around knee and hipjoints and lastly mild zinc defficiency occasionally leading to dermatopathy (Reference may be made to the Proceedings of National Thalassemia Conference, 5-6 February, 1994, held in Delhi; LI: Oral Iron Chelation Therapy- Indian Study by M .B. Agrawal). The cost of a capsule Deferiprone is approximately Rs<br><br>
12/-.  A  patient  has to take 3-6 capsules per  day.  This  will amount to Rs 10OO- 2000/- per month.<br>
Another method which is available for the treatment of the disease Thalassemia (major) is by the bone marrow transplantation (BUT). This is done by the taking the bone marrow of the matching donor and injecting it to the patient. The cost of such a treatment is around Rs 15,00,000/-. This is therefore beyond the reach of common man. Several treatments using bone marrow have been performed in Italy. Recently Christian Medical College (Vellore) and Appolo Hospital (Madras) have also started this type of BMT treatment in India, but the cost is also on the higher side (Rs 7 Lac approx). Further increase in life span expectancy of these patients have yet to be established.<br>
Under the prevailing present day conditions, regular blood transfusion and use of the drug 'Desferal1 by injection as explained above, is the best way of treatment of this dreaded disease. Since a. decade, efforts are being made by medical profession throughout the world to find a treatment of this disease by a drug which will be low cost and can be administered orally and have no side effect, but there has been no success so far.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide a formulation useful for iron-chelation for the treatment of Thalassemia.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide a formulation useful for the treatment of Thalssemia with increase therapeutic efficacy.<br>
Yet another of the present invention' objective is to  provide<br>
a formulation for the treatment of Thaiassemia which is much cheaper and hence afforadable by a common man. .<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to provide a formulation useful for the treatment of patients suffering from Thalassemia which can be administered orally.<br>
Still yet another object of the present invention is to provide a formulation whic has no side effect and is very convenient to administer.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a formulation useful for the treatment of Thalassemia, the dose of which can be continued for a long period without damaging any vital organ of the body of the patients.<br>
With the above objectives in view our work initially directed  in red blood cells and at the same time, to enhance the oxygen carrying capacity to the tissues. Different compounds of  Vanadium,  Arsenic, oxalic acid and citric acid were  tried  initially but  these  compound: fai1ed in making a major break  through.  BY these  research only sodium meta vanadate and arsenic were  found to  be effective partially in increasing the red blood cells  and also  helped in increasing the percentage of haemoglobin in  the blood of the patients suffering from Thalassemia.<br>
It has been observed that patients suffering from Thalassemic disease have a change in complexion, anorexia, blackness of gums, increase in serum ferritin level and a remarkable iron overload in the body due to the breaking down of red blood cells. The treatment mentioned above which involves repeated blood transfusion also accumulates the above elements in the body of the patients suffering from Thalassemic disease.<br>
Children  suffering  from Thai lassemia diesease dolnoVshow   any<br>
resistance from viral infection and also  suffer from body  ache. / They are also immune to malaria.<br>
Our  reserach work was primarilly directed  to find  an  immediate solution for the survival of suoh patients, whfl hftd An ir-fm<br>
overload in the body and the other side ailments mentioned above. Efforts, therefore, were directed towards finding out an alternate drug which can be used orally and have no side effects. Anemonin Pretensis (powder) has been used for many years by tribals of Siberia to poison their arrows. Anemonin Pretensis is extracted with an organic solvent such as ethanol from fresh whole wind flower plant with roots and flowers and some fruits of wind flowers. The dried material is treated with an organic solvent such as ethanol and refluxed. Anemonin Pretensis obtained from the extraction is filtered and recrystalIized from an organic solvent such as ethanol.The medical history of this herb also reveals that this herb was involved in homeopathic practice in 1805 for some female hormone problem.<br>
th'emonin  Pretensis) is  a pure herbal  product  .  This  is<br>
present in the wind flower plant which is growing in wild state in the open fields and plains in many parts of Europe, Russia and Turkey in Asia. The chemical formula of Anemonin prentesis having the formula 1, shown in the drawing accompanying this<br>
specification,  isolated  from  fresh wind flower  plant  is  1-2<br>
dihydroxy 1-2 cyolobutane diacrylic acid dilactone. Reference may<br>
th be made to Merk index p-87, Entry no. 677, 9   edition .<br>
Patients  suffering from Thalassemic disease are  immune  to<br>
malarial  attack.  Considering the nature  and  considering  that quinine sulphate a known antimalarial drug which has  antipyretic and analgesic properties, we considered incorporating quinine sulphate in the formulation to reduce the high temperature and body-ache problem of the patients suffering from Thalassemic disease.<br>
Quinine is having the chemical composition C  H  N 0 . It is<br>
40 48 4 4 obtained  from Cinchona bark available in India, Srilanka,  Equa-<br>
dor, Columbia, Peru and Bolivia. Cinchona Thrives at higher elevation such as 6000-6500 ft. Quinine is also extracted with an organic solvent such as ethanol from the bark of the plant (Cinchona), refluxed, filtered and recrystal1ized with an organic solvent such as ethanol. Quinine sulphate is prepared by reacting quinine and dilute sulphuric acid in a molar ratio. It is a snow white, light odourless extremely bitter crystallized needles<br>
having the chemical composition C  H  N 0 , H SO , &amp; H 0. Refer<br>

By  our continuous and sustained reserach work based on  the above  mentioned directions we observed that when we blended  the powder of Anemonin Pretensis with quinine sulphate and  dissolved in  suitable solvent and the solution was administered orally  td the  patient  suffering from Thalassemia,  there  was  remarkable improvement of complexion and reduction of serum ferritin  level. There was no fever . There was also no body ache . The  treatment was  continued and more patients were put on trial on this  drug. There were no side effects. This revealed that the fomulation  is very  useful  in  te treatment of  the  patients  suffering  fora<br>
Thalassemia.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a pharmaceutical formulation useful as low cast iron chelating drug for Thalassemia patients which comprises:<br>
i)        0.02 to 0.12 wt% powder of Anemonin Pretensis , ii)       0.0005 to 0.003 wt% quinine sulphate , iii)     \0 to 40wt%   distilled or demineralised water iv)      100 to 60 wt% edible solvent.<br>
The solvent used may be selected from solvent ethanol, absolute alcohol etc.<br>
The Anemonin pretensis powder and the quinine sulphate employed in the formulation may be of pharmaceutical grade.<br>
The Anemonin pretensis possesses the properties of chelating iron. Quinine sulphate seems to accelearate the chelation of iron present in the body of the patient suffering from thalassemia. We have found by forming a formulation of Anemonin pretensis and quinine sulphate in the amount mentioned above results in an unexpected properties which ar not present in the individual components. There is therefore a synergistic activity when they are combines in the above mentioned quantities.<br>
The formulation of the present invention is therefore not a mere admixture of the ingredients employed but a synergistic mixture, the properties of which are not merely the aggregate properties of the individual ingredients.<br>
The formulation of the present invention when administered to patients suffering from Thalassemic dbisease works as follows: The iron present in the body of the patients forms a complex with anemonin shown in the formula 2 (Closed ring structure) or in formula 3 (Streched structure) where three molecules of anemonin can form complex with two iron atoms. The quinine sulphate present in the formulation acts as a catalyst for the formation of the complex thereby not only reducing the amount of Anemonin in the composition and but also use the maximum amount of iron present in the body. In addition the antipyretic and analgesic property of quinine sulphate helps to control the fever and the bodyache problem present in such patients.<br>
The iron complex so formed is soluble in the body fluids. The fluid containing the complex reaches the kidney through the body system of the body and it is then excreted from the body of patients through urine. Some of the complex is also excreted through elementry canal and finally facaeces. By this processor the excess iron present in the body of the patients is removed thereby enhancing the life span of the patients.<br>
