The compounds of general formula (I) can be prepared by the processes illustrated in the following schemes.<br>
According to a first preparation route (Scheme 1), a compound of general formula (II), in which X1, X2, X3 and X4 are as defined in the general formula (I), is reacted with methyl carbonate in the presence of a catalytic amount of a base, such as<br><br>
9<br>
sodium methoxide or sodium hydride, to obtain the ketoester of general formula (III) . The condensation of the ketoester (III) with hydrazine, for example in a polar solvent, such as DMF or acetic acid, makes it possible to isolate the pyrazole of general formula (IV). The latter is subsequently N-substituted nonselectively by the action of an aryl or heteroaryl halide of general formula Y-hal, in which Y is as defined in the general formula (I) and hal is a halogen atom, such as an iodine or a bromine, in the presence of a base, such as potassium or caesium carbonate, or<br>
of potassium triphosphate, of a catalytic amount of a<br>
copper salt and of a diamine (S.L. Buchwald, J. Am.<br>
Chem. Soc, 2001, 123, 7727).<br>
The resulting mixture composed of the<br>
positional isomers of general formulae (Va) and (Vb),<br>
in which the Y group is respectively in the 2-position and in the 3-position of the pyrazole ring, is subsequently derivatized by the action of a carbamoyl chloride derivative of general formula ClC(W)NR1R2, in<br>
which W, R1 and R2 are as defined in the general formula<br>
(I), in the presence of a base, such as potassium<br>
carbonate, sodium hydride or tiriethylamine, to obtain the carbamates of general formulae (Ia) and (Ib), which are separated, at this stage, by methods known to a person skilled in the art, such as chromatography on a<br>
silica column.<br><br>
10<br><br>
10<br><br><br><br><br><br>
11<br>
makes it possible to prepare the compounds of general<br>
formula (Ia) (Scheme 2).<br>
Scheme.2<br><br>
It consists in condensing the ketoester of general formula (III), as defined above, with a<br>
hydrazine of general formula Y-NH-NH2 in which Y is as<br>
defined in the general formula (I), for example in a<br>
polar solvent, such as DMF or acetic acid, and makes it<br>
possible to isolate the pyrazole of general formula<br><br><br>
12<br>
(Va), as defined above. The latter is subsequently acylated by the action of a carbamoyl chloride derivative of general formula ClC(W)NR1R2, as defined above, in the presence of a base, such as potassium<br>
carbonate, sodium hydride or triethylamine, to obtain<br>
the carbamate of general formula (Ia).<br>
The single bond in the C4-C5 position of the compounds of general formula (I) can optionally be dehydrogenated to form a double bond according to a<br>
method known to a person skilled in the art, for<br>
example by analogy with the method described by Kozo, Shishido et al., Tetrahedron, 1989, 45, 18, 5791-5804. Alternatively, the compounds of general formula (I) comprising a single bond in the C4-C5 position can be dehydrogenated by reaction with a halogenating agent, such as N-bromosuccinimide, in the presence of an initiator, such as 2 , 2 '-azobis (2-methylpropionitrile) . Under these conditions, the compound of general formula (I) comprising a single bond in the C4-C5 position is first halogenated and then the resulting intermediate is subjected to an elimination reaction to result in the compound (I) comprising a double bond in the C4-C5 position.<br>
In Schemes 1 and 2, the reactants, when their method of preparation is not described, are commercially available or are described in the literature or else can be prepared according to methods which are described therein or which are known to a<br><br>
13<br>
person skilledi in the art.<br>
The compounds of general formula (II) can be obtained from commercial sources or c'an be prepared using methods described in the literature (Sims, J.J. et al., Tetrahedron Lett. 1971, 951).<br>
Another subject-matter of the invention,<br>
according to another of its aspects, is the compounds<br>
of formulae (Va) and (Vb). These compounds may be of<br>
use as intermediates in the synthesis of the compounds of formula (I).<br>
The chemical structures and the physical properties of a few compounds of general formulae (Va) and (Vb) of the invention are illustrated in the following Table 1. The melting points of the products are given in the "M.p." column].<br>

The compounds of the invention also exhibit characteristics of solubility in water which promote good in vivo activity.<br><br>

Study of the binding of [3H] Ro5-48 64 to peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors (PBR or p sites)<br>
The affinity of the compounds of the invention for PBR or p sites (sites of binding of peripheral type to benzodiazepines) was determined.<br>
The p site receptors can be labelled<br>
selectively in rat kidney membranes incubated in the presence of [3H]Ro5-4864. The compounds of the invention have formed the subject, of an in vitro study with respect to their affinity for these receptors.<br>
The animals used are male Sprague-Dawley rats (Iffa Credo) weighing 180 to 300 g. After decapitation, the kidney is removed and the tissue is homogenized at 4°C using a PolytronTM homogenizer for 2 min at 6/10 of the maximum speed in 35 volumes of 50 mM Na2HPO4 phosphate buffer at a pH adjusted to 7.5 with NaH2PO4. The membrane homogenate, is filtered through gauze and diluted tenfold with buffer.<br>
[3H]Ro5-4864 (specific activity:<br>
70-90 Ci/mmol; New England Nuclear), at a concentration of 0.5 nM, is incubated in the presence of 100 µl of the membrane homogenate in a final volume of 1 ml of buffer comprising the test compound.<br>
After incubating for 3 h at 0°C, the<br>
membranes are recovered by filtration through Whatman GF/B™ filters washed with 2 times 4.5 ml of cold (0°C) incubation buffer. The amount of radioactivity retained by the filter is measured by liquid scintigraphy.<br><br>
35<br>
For each concentration of studied compound, the percentage of inhibition of the binding of [3H] Ro5-4864 is determined and then the IC50 concentration, the concentration which inhibits 50% of the specific binding, is determined.<br>
The IC50 values of the most active compounds of the invention range from 0.5 nM to 300 nM. In particular, compounds Nos 14, 20 and 56 in Table 2 exhibit respective IC5n values of 1.6 nM, 2.8 nM and 1.4 nM.<br>
The compounds of the invention are therefore ligands with an affinity for peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors.<br>
Study of the neuroprotective activity<br>
Test of survival of the motor neurons after sectioning<br>
the facial nerve in rats aged 4 days<br>
After lesion of the facial nerve in immature rats, the motor neurons of the facial nucleus experience neuronal death by apoptosis. Neuronal survival is evaluated using neuronal counting and histological methods.<br>
Immature rats aged 4 days are anaesthetized with pentobarbital (3 mg/kg by the i.p. route). The right facial nerve is exposed and sectioned at its outlet from the stylomastoid foramen. After waking up, the young rats are returned to their mothers and are treated for 7 days with one or two daily<br><br>
36<br>
administrations, by the oral or intraperitoneal route, at doses ranging from 1 to 10 mg/kg.<br>
7 days after the lesion, the animals are decapitated and the brains are frozen in isopentane at -40°C. The entire facial nerve is cut with a cryostat into sections with a width of 10 µm. The motor neurons are stained with cresyl violet and counted using the Histo™ software (BiocomTM) .<br>
In this model, the compounds of the invention increase neuronal survival by 38 to 78%. The results of the test of survival of the motor neurons for compounds Nos 14, 20 and 56 of the table are presented in Table 3 below.<br><br>

No.	   14	  20	56<br>

The results of the tests show that the most active compounds of the invention promote neuroprotection.<br>
The compounds of the invention can thus be used for the preparation of medicaments, in particular for the preparation of a medicament intended to prevent or treat a pathology in which peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors are involved.<br>
Thus, according to another of its aspects, a<br><br>
37<br>
subject-matter of the invention is medicaments which comprise a compound of formula (I), or an addition salt of the latter with a pharmaceutically acceptable acid, or a hydrate or a solvate.<br>
These medicaments are employed in<br>
therapeutics, in particular in the prevention and/or treatment of various types of peripheral neuropathies, such as traumatic or ischaemic neuropathies, infectious, alcoholic, diabetic, medicinal or genetic neuropathies, and motor neuron conditions, such as spinal amyotrophies and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. These medicaments will also find an application in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system, either of acute type, such as strokes and cranial and medullar traumas, or of chronic type, such as autoimmune diseases (multiple sclerosis), Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and any other disease in which the administration of neuroprotective/neurotrophic factors is supposed to have a therapeutic effect.<br>
The compounds of the invention can also be used for the preparation of medicaments intended for the prevention and/or treatment of anxiety, of epilepsy and of sleep disorders. This is because ligands of the PBR or p sites stimulate the production of neurosteroids, such as pregnenolone, dehydroepiandro-sterone and 3a-hydroxy-5aot-pregnan-20-one, by promoting the transfer of cholesterol from the outside to the<br><br>
38<br>
inside of the mitochondrial membrane. These neurosteroids modulate the activity of the GABAA-chloride channel macromolecular complex and can thus produce anxiolytic, anticonvulsant and sedative activities.<br>
The compounds of the invention can also be used in the treatment of acute or chronic renal insufficiency, of glomerulonephritis, of diabetic nephropathy, of cardiac ischaemia and cardiac insufficiency, of myocardial infarction, of ischaemia of the lower limbs, of coronary vasospasm, of angina pectoris, of pathologies associated with the heart valves, of inflammatory heart diseases, of side effects due to cardiotoxic medicaments or as a result of heart surgery, of atherosclerosis and of its thromboembolic complications, of restenosis, of graft rejections, or of conditions related to incorrect- proliferation or incorrect migration of smooth muscle cells.<br>
Furthermore, recent data in the literature indicate that the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor might play a fundamental role in the regulation of cell proliferation and cancerization processes. Generally, and in comparison with normal tissues, an increased density of peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors is observed in various types of tumours and cancers.<br>
In human astrocytomas, the level of expression of the peripheral-type benzodiazepine<br><br>
39<br>
receptor is correlated with the degree of malignancy of the tumour, the proliferation index and the survival of the patients. In human cerebral tumours, the increase in the number of peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors is used as a diagnostic indication in medical imaging and as a therapeutic target for conjugates formed from a ligand of the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor and from a cytostatic drug. A high density of peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors is also observed in ovarian carcinomas and breast cancers. As regards the latter, it has been demonstrated that the level of expression of the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors is related to the aggressive potential of the tumour; furthermore, the presence of a peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor agonist stimulates the growth of a mammary cancer line.<br>
These combined results, which suggest a deleterious function of the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor in cancerization processes, constitute a relevant basis for the search for synthetic ligands specific for the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor which are capable of blocking the effects thereof.<br>
The compounds can therefore be used for the treatment of tumours and cancers.<br>
The peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors are also present in the skin and, in this respect, the<br><br>
40<br>
compounds which can be used according to the invention can be used for the prophylaxis or the treatment of cutaneous stress.<br>
The term "cutaneous stress" is understood to mean the various situations which might cause damage, in particular to the epidermis, whatever the agent which causes this stress. This agent can be internal and/or external to the body, such as a chemical or free-radical agent, or else external, such as ultraviolet radiation.<br>
Thus, the compounds which can be used<br>
according to the invention are intended to prevent and to combat cutaneous irritation, dry patches, erythemas, dysaesthetic sensations, heating sensations, pruritus of the skin and/or mucous membranes, or ageing, and can also be used in cutaneous disorders, such as, for example, psoriasis, pruriginous diseases, herpes, photodermatoses, atopic dermatitides, contact dermatitides, lichens, prurigo, pruritus, insect stings, in fibroses and other disorders of collagen maturation, in immunological disorders or in dermatological conditions, such as eczema.<br>
The compounds of the invention can also be used for the prevention and treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases, in particular rheumatoid arthritis, and pulmonary inflammatory diseases.<br>
According to another of its aspects, the present invention relates to pharmaceutical<br><br>

compositions comprising, as active principle, a compound according to the invention. These pharmaceutical compositions comprise an effective dose of at least one compound according to the invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, a hydrate or a solvate of the said compound, and at least one pharmaceutically acceptable excipient. The said excipients are chosen, according to the pharmaceutical form and the method of administration desired, from the usual excipients known to a person skilled in the art.<br>
In the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention for oral, sublingual, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, topical, local, mtratracheal, intranasal, transdermal or rectal administration, the active principle of formula (I) above, or its optional salt, solvate or hydrate, can be administered in unit administration form, as a mixture with conventional pharmaceutical excipients, to animals and human beings for the prophylaxis or treatment of the above disorders or diseases.<br>
The appropriate unit administration forms comprise oral forms, such as tablets, soft or hard gelatin capsules, powders, granules and oral solutions or suspensions, sublingual, buccal, intratracheal, intraocular and intranasal administration forms, forms for administration by inhalation, topical, transdermal, subcutaneous, intramuscular or intravenous administration forms, rectal administration forms and<br><br>
