HELD OF INVENTION The present application relates to high efficiency encapsulates and compositions, such as consumer products, comprising such high efficiency encapsulates as well as processes for maicing and using such high efficiency encapsulates and compositions comprising such high efficiency encapsulates.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Benefit agents, such as perfumes, silicones, waxes, flavors, vitamins and fabric softening agents, are expensive and/or generally less effective when employed at high levels in consumer products, for example, personal care compositions, cleaning compositions, and fabric care compositions. As a result, there is a desire to maximize the effectiveness of such benefit agents. One method of achieving such objective is to improve the delivery efficiencies of such benefit agents. Unfortunately, it is difficult to improve the delivery efficiencies of benefit agents as such agents may be lost do to the agents' physical or chemical characteristics, or such agents may be incompatible with other compositional components or the situs that is treated.<br>
One method of improving the delivery efficiency of a benefit agent is to encapsulate such benefit agent. While such efforts may improve the delivery efficiency of the benefit agent, further delivery efficiency improvements are desired as encapsulated benefit agents may be lost before or after they are applied to the situs of interest due to factors such as mechanical or che.mical interactions, for example the action of wash and or rinse liquors, and/or charge interactions. In certain applications, the deposition of encapsulated benefit agents is improved by coating the encapsulated benefit agent with a polymers. In general, such polymer coating improves the deposition of the encapsulates. However, when multiple surfaces are treated simultaneously, for example, a load of laundry containing a variety of fabrics, each surface is typically treated to a different degree (more or less benefit agent being delivered). For cases where the benefit agent is a peifume, the different treatment levels on the different fabrics of a wash load, can lead to too strong odor on some fabrics and to too weak an odor on other fabrics. Applicants recognized that the source of the unequal treatment problem was primarily due to preferential encapsulate deposition that was driven by the polymeric deposition aid. Thus what is needed are encapsulated benefit agents that have a high and even deposition profile across multiple different surfaces.<br>
 <br>
2<br>
In the present application. Applicants disclose encapsulated benefit agents and specific classes of amine containing polymers that, when combined, provide a high and even deposition profile across multiple different surfaces, for example, hair, skin, and multiple fabrics such as cotton, high surface cottons, polycotton and polyester.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present application relates to high efficiency encapsulates and compositions, such as consumer products, comprising such high efficiency encapsulates as well as processes for making and using such high efficiency encapsulates and compositions comprising such high efficiency encapsulates.<br>

PERFUME MICROCAPSULE<br>
It is advantageous to add perfume in the form of encapsulated perfume ingredients to a composition, as the encapsulation of the perfume ingredients allows a controlled and eventually targeted release of the perfume ingredients. Perfume ingredients, are the individual chemical compounds that are used to make a perfume composition. A perfume composition comprises one or more perfume ingredients, the choice of type and number of ingredients being dependent upon the final desired scent. The present invention may comprise perfume microcapsules. It is well known to those skilled in the art, that perfume microcapsules release perfume ingredients during handling of fabrics and during the in wear .process, providing improved longer lasting freshness on fabrics, as compared to the addition of neat perfume alone. The release of the perfume ingredients is triggered by mechanical stress breaking the capsule wall and allowing the diffusion of the encapsulated perfume ingredient.<br>
A perfume microcapsule comprises a capsule surrounding a core, that core comprising perfume ingredients. The capsule can be made of a number of materials, but most preferred is cross-linked melamine formaldehyde. The capsule wall material may comprise a suitable resin including the reaction product of an aldehyde, and an amine, suitable aldehydes include, formaldehyde. Suitable amines can include those selected from the group comprising melamine, urea, benzoguanamine, glycoluril, and mixtures thereof. Suitable melamines can include those selected from the group comprising methylol melamine, methylated methylol melamine, imino melamine and mixtures thereof. Suitable ureas can include those selected from the group comprising dimethylol urea, methylated dimethylol urea, urea-resorcinol, and mixtures thereof.<br>
In the context of the present invention, any suitable perfiime ingredient may be used. Those skilled in the art will recognize suitable compatible perfume ingredients for use in the perfume<br>
 <br>
18<br>
microcapsules, and will know how to select combinations of ingredients to achieve desired scents.<br>
In one aspect, at least 75%, 85% or even 90% of said perfume microcapsules may have a particle size of from about 1 microns to about 80 microns, about 5 microns to 60 microns, from about 10 microns to about 50 microns, or even from about 15 microns to about 40 microns.<br>
At least 75%, 85% or even 90% of said perfume microcapsules may have a particle wall thickness of from about 60 nm to about 250 nm, from about 80 nm to about 180 nm, or even from about 100 nm to about 160 nm.<br>
The liquid fabric softening compositions of the present invention comprise from 0.05% to 0.8% by weight of the liquid fabric softening composition of encapsulated perfume ingredients, present in the form of a perfume microcapsule. This amount is necessary to ensure sufficient perfume is deposited onto the fabrics. Perfume and perfume microcapsules are washed away during the laundry process. Therefore, it is important to have enough perfume in the liquid fabric softening composition to take account of the inevitable loss, yet still have sufficient deposition onto fabrics. In one aspect, said perfume microcapsule may be spray dried.<br>

4.8,	25 grams of partially methylated methylol melamine resin (Cymel 385, 80% solids, Cytec). This mixture is heated to 70 "C and maintained overnight with continuous stirring to complete the encapsulation process. 23 grams of acetoacetamide (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, Missouri, U.S.A.) is added to the suspension. An average capsule size of 30um is obtained as analyzed by a Model 780 Accusizer.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Procedure for preparing polymer coated perfume microcapsules<br>
Polymer coated perfume microcapsules are prepared by weighing 99g of melamine formaldehyde perfume microcapsules reference slurry (99.75%) and the Ig of Lupamin9030,<br>
 <br>
46<br>
16% active (ex BASF, Ludwigshafen, Germany) in a glass jar. The two ingredients are shortly mixed with a spoon. They are further mixed overnight in a shaker.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
Procedure for including coated perfume microcapsules in a liquid laundry detergent<br>
74.9 g of compact liquid detergent free of perfume microcapsules is weighed and the 1.33 g of polymer coated perfume microcapsules is added.<br>
The resulting product is mixed with a mechanical mixer for 1 minute.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
A 9 kg aliquot of perfume microcapsule slurry of Examples 2 is mixed using a Eurostar mixer (IKA) with a R1382 attachment at a constant speed of 200 RPM. To the aliquot 500 g of carboxymethyl cellulose (CP Kelco) is added while mixing using the Eurostar mixer with same attachment and speed as described above. The slurry is mixed for a total of two hours or until a uniform paste is formed.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
1.28 kg of precipitated silica Sipemat® 22S (Degussa) is added to a F-20 paddle mixer (Forberg). The mixer is run initially for 5 seconds to distribute the silica evenly on the base of the mixer. The mixer is stopped and 8.25kg of paste, made according to Example 4, is evenly distributed onto the powder. The mixer is then run at 120 rpm for a total of 30 seconds. Following mixing, the wet particles are dumped out of the mixer and screened using a 2000 micron sieve to remove the oversize. The product passing through the screen is dried in 500g batches in a CDT 0.02 fluid bed diyer (Niro) to a final moisture content of 20 wt% measured by Karl Fischer. The dryer is operated at an inlet temperature of 140°C and air velocity of 0.68m/s.<br>
