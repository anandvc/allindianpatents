COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(under section 10 and rule 13)<br>
Title<br>
FLAKES MADE OF MATERIALS SUCH AS GLASS<br>
Applicant<br>
Name:	WATKINSON, Charles<br>
Nationality:	Great Britain, a National and Resident of Great Britain.<br>
Address:	Bridge Cottage, Long Lane,<br>
Great Heck, Yorkshire, DN14 OBE Great Britain.<br>
The following specification specifically and particularly describes the invention and the way in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
FLAKES MADE OF MATERIALS SUCH AS GLASS Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to flakes or other particles of glass or other vitreous, ceramic or metallic materials, in particular to flakes or particles having a small thickness, to methods of manufacturing such flakes or particles, certain uses of them and to items containing them.<br>
Background to the Invention<br>
A method of producing glass flakes is known which makes use of a spinning cup to produce a flat film of molten glass emanating radially from the rim of a rotating cup. The film is fed between two plates, forming an annular venturi and is super-cooled with forced air. The film is broken up due to the high velocity air stream and the drag (frictional resistance) imparted by it. Such a method and apparatus to perform it is the subject of EP  0 289 240.<br>
The parameters involved in the successful production of a flat glass flake of even thickness, according to the method described in EP 0 289 240 are varied and complex. They have been found to include the following: -<br>
•	glass composition, melt temperature and viscosity<br>
•	temperature of glass in the melt tank<br>
•	mass flow of glass leaving the tank and entering the cup<br>
•	temperature of the glass entering the cup<br>
•	distance between the outlet of the glass tank and entry to the cup<br>
•	diameter and depth of the cup<br>
•	heat dissipation properties of the cup<br>
•	rotational speed of the cup<br>
•	distance between the rim of the cup and entry to the radial venturi<br>
•	distance between the plates forming the radial venturi<br>
•	diameter of the venturi plates<br>
•	volume and pressure of air being drawn between the venturi plates<br>
•	temperature of the air flowing between the venturi plates<br>
•	diameter and construction of the cyclone collector<br><br>
These parameters can all be varied with the result that glass flakes either are or are not produced. Flakes, if produced, may be flat or wavy. The flakes may have a substantial variation in thickness or be very consistent in thickness. The flakes may be large or small in cross-section and/or thickness.<br>
Using the said method and with appropriate control of the above mentioned parameters, it was initially possible to prepare flake having a mean thickness range of from 1 to lOum. Further development work resulted in the ability to produce flake having a mean thickness of from 350nm to lum.<br>
However such a method could not be used for the manufacture of silica (glass) flake having a mean thickness below about 350nm.<br>
With a view to producing flakes below about 350 ran, the apparatus disclosed in WO 2004/056716 provides for the heating of the descending glass stream from the melter tank by passing an electrical current through the said stream between an upper electrode near the exit spout from the melter tank to a lower electrical connection attached to the spinning device. However there are a number of disadvantages associated with such apparatus. Firstly, such equipment typically requires a very high voltage (typically in excess of 5,000 V and in many cases up to 10,000 V) to ensure sufficient heating and this creates a very serious risk of electrocution for the operator. Secondly, such equipment often fails to function efficiently for prolonged production runs, Without wishing to be bound by any theory, it is thought that this is because the hot glass stream entering the cup solidifies on contact with the much cooler mass of the spinning cup and forms an electrically insulating layer, which greatly reduces the amount of current that passes up the descending glass stream and thus the associated heating.<br>
WO 2004/056716 also provides for the heating of the descending glass stream by the use of RF induction heating but that method has been found to be inefficient and difficult to implement effectively in production.<br><br>
The flakes<br>
According to the present invention there is provided flake having a mean thickness up to 350nm. Preferably, the flake has a mean thickness of up to 200nm. A particularly preferred range is from 10 to lOOnm including a range of from 40 to lOOnm.<br>
Preferably, the aspect ratio of the maximum transverse dimension to thickness is from 50:1 to 25,000:1, preferably from 50:1 to 1500:1.<br>
Flakes in accordance with the present invention may be composed of glass, basalt, ceramics such as alumina, graphite and metals, for instance copper. Glass is the preferred material, an example being ECR glass. Other examples are C glass, E glass LA glass.<br>
It is preferred that glass flake of the present invention is of a substantially uniform thickness. Preferably, at least 80% of the glass flake is within 20% of the nominal mean thickness.<br>
Method of Making The Flakes<br>
In order to manufacture glass flakes according to the invention, with a low thickness and/or low thickness distribution, it has been discovered that it is necessary to carefully control the following parameters:-<br>
•	glass composition, melt temperature and viscosity<br>
•	temperature of glass in the melt tank<br>
•	mass flow of glass leaving the tank and entering the cup<br>
•	temperature of the glass entering the cup<br>
•	distance between the outlet of the glass tank and entry to the cup<br>
•	diameter and depth of the cup<br>
•	heat dissipation properties of the cup<br>
•	rotational speed of the cup<br><br>
•	distance between the rim of the cup and entry to the radial venturi<br>
•	distance between the plates forming the radial venturi<br>
•	diameter of the venturi plates<br>
•	volume and pressure of air being drawn between the venturi plates<br>
•	temperature of the air flowing between the venturi plates<br>
•	diameter and construction of the cyclone collector<br>
To make glass flakes according to the invention it has further been found that it is necessary to operate the melter tank at higher temperatures in the range of 1050 to 1600°C.<br>
It has further been found that to produce such flakes it is particularly important to control very carefully (i) the temperature of the glass stream leaving the melt tank (ii) the mass flow of the glass stream, (hi) the heat loss of fee glass In the spinning cup and (iv) the spinning of the molten film and its stretching (before it is super-cooled and broken into flake).<br>
In relation to the control of the temperature of the glass stream leaving the melter tank within the desired range, it is important to reduce the amount of heat loss to a very low<br>
level.<br>
It has been found that the molten glass loses a lot of heat in the spinning cup, which is made of metal and has a high mass, conductivity and specific heat properties relative to the amount of molten glass in it at any single point in time during the production process. The amount of heat loss in known cups, whilst desirable for the production of thicker flake, has surprisingly been found to be a limiting factor in the thinness of flakes that can be made with known equipment. To reduce the thickness of the resulting flake to make flakes according to the invention it has been found that it is desirable to insulate the cup to prevent heat loss. Further it has been found that it is desirable to provide a means for heating the cup.<br><br>
By the use of such insulation and/or heating it is possible to dispense with the use of external RF (microwave) heating of the descending glass stream (of the type as described in WO 2004/056716) or else it can be achieved with an increased fall of the glass, thus facilitating increased ease of operation of the equipment by the user.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, both external RF heating and insulation and/or heating of the cup are used. The interaction between such elements enables the glass to leave the cup and enter the venturi plates at a much higher temperature than with known methods and permits the production of small flakes with a mean thickness in the range of 10 to 350nm. Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that the external heating of the glass, during its descent from the melter, ensures that the insulated and/or heated cup stays at a much higher temperature thus enabling the exiting glass to be made into thinner flakes on passing through the venturi plates.<br>
The Cup<br>
The insulation of the cup will now be described in more detail with reference to Figure 1 of the accompanying drawings which is a longitudinal section through part of equipment of the present invention.<br>
The cup 1 is manufactured from e.g. a suitable steel but other metals such as platinum could be used as could other alloys. Forming the upper part of the cup there is an upper portion 2. The upper portion has a central conical section 3 removed. The diameter of the removed section 4 is 48 mm at the top and 28 mm at the bottom and the internal depth of the cup 1 is from 15 to 16 mm.<br>
The upper portion 2 is detachable from and fixably connected to a lower portion 6. The lower portion 6 has a lower removed cylindrical section 7 for detachably connecting the lower portion 6 to the output drive shaft of an electric motor (not shown).<br>
To produce flakes according to the invention it is necessary to provide very effective insulation around the central conical section 3. Insulation which is sufficient to enable this to be achieved is shown on Figure 1 (8a and 8b). The upper portion 3 has had a cylindrical<br><br>
recess ,9 machined into it Materials suitable for use as insulation include a high temperature ceramic fibre blanket. So as to hold the insulation 8a in place a close fitting outer substantially cylindrical section 1 is provided, which is capable of being detachably or permanently connected to the upper portion 2 by known connection means such as bolts (not shown) or by welding.<br>
To consistently make flakes according to the invention it has been found that advantageously further insulation 8b can be used at the lower end of the central conical section 3. This is fitted into a machined recess 11 and held in place when the lower portion 6 is connected to the upper portion 2 by known connection means such as bolts (not shown) or by welding.<br>
The Heating Device<br>
The heating device for the cup will now be described in more detail by reference to<br>
Figures 2 and 3 of the accompanying drawings.<br>
Figure 2 shows a suitable heating device which comprises a coil 1 fitted closely around the spinning cup 2 connected to an RF (microwave) generator 3 which in operation induces energy directly into the metal cup 2.<br>
Figure 3 shows an alternative array of gas flame jets 1 directed inwardly from annular tube burner 3 (fed with gas mixture 4 along ga.s feed pipe 5) onto the outer surface of the cup 2 to heat it or simply reduce heat loss from the spinning cup.<br>
The preferred method is the RF heating method described above and illustrated in Figure 2 as by using it there is no risk of the gas jets inadvertently pre-heating the cooling air stream which flows into and between the venturi pl&amp;tes. Such pre-heating may make it impossible or difficult to produce (consistently) the desired flakes.<br>
Examples<br>
Examples of the method using the apparatus according to the invention will now be given.<br><br>
Example 1.<br>
Glass type	ECR Glass<br>
Glass temp at exit from tank	1230'C<br>
Height of drop	400mm<br>
Venturi Plate Gap	10mm<br>
Air Pressure	380mm WG<br>
Cup Diameter	48mm<br>
Cup Type	Insulated<br>
Cup Speed	5000 RPM<br>
Flakes mean thickness produced	350nm<br>
In relation to the control of the mass flow of the glass stream leaving the melter tank, this can also be increased or reduced and hence controlled by preferably using a nozzle which is oversized relative to the size of the desired flow. The said nozzle is cooled, thereby solidifying glass at the outer diameter of the nozzle bore and constricting the glass stream prior to it being fed in a downward direction using appropriate cooling apparatus (for example that cooling apparatus described in patent application WO 2004/056716). Alternatively, a sliding gate vale apparatus can be attached to the front of the nozzle to control flow.<br>
Example 2<br>
Glass type	LAG6 Borosilicate.<br>
Glass temp at exit from tank	1360°C<br>
Height of drop	3 5 Omm<br>
Venturi Plate Gap	8mm<br>
Air Pressure	420mm WG<br>
Cup Diameter	38mm<br>
Cup Type	Insulated<br>
Cup Speed	6000 RPM<br>
Plaices mean thickness produced	1 OOnm<br>
There are closer tolerances on the cup size and annular venturi and a higher velocity through the venturi and a lower air pressure.<br><br>
For any particular glass composition, there are a set of parameters which will produce a flat flake of consistent thickness. The following ranges and conditions may be adopted, or at least some of them, in order to produce very thin glass flake according to the invention:<br>
•	mass flow between 0.2 and 2.5 kilos per minute<br>
•	glass temperature at control nozzle of from 1200 to 1450°C<br>
•	glass temperature of the spinning cup of from 1220 to 1350°C<br>
•	distance between the melt tank control nozzle and entry to the spinning cup of from 75 to 500mm<br>
•	spinning cup diameter of from 28 to 48mm OD<br>
•	spuming cup depth of from 15 to 60mm<br>
•	Rotation speed of the spinning cup from 5000 to 14,000 RPM<br>
•	spinning cup externally insulated as per example 2 and/or heated.<br>
•	distance between edge of spinner and entry to annular venturi of from 10 to 75mm<br>
•	gap between plates forming annular venturi of from 2 to 12mm<br>
•	air pressure within system of from 180 to 580mm water gauge<br>
The above are parameters that, for a given mass flow and temperature, it is possible to produce nano particulate flake within the thicknesses mentioned above. The glass composition may vary widely and it is also possible to produce ceramic flake within these parameters but using a temperature of between 1450 and 1800°C and a cooled spinning cup. The parameters may be required to be varied when producing flake from metals or other heat liquidous (meltable) materials.<br>
