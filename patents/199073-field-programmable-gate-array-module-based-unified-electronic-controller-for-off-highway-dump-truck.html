A dumper is an equipment for hauling &amp; dumping loose materials such as coal, copper &amp; iron ores, soil etc. with a body that discharges its contents by gravity. Most of the mines operate fleet of large dump trucks for mineral production .The dumpers are also useful in mining extraction i.e removal of top soil layer called over burden. In short, these trucks are employed in large numbers in surface mining of coal, lime stone, copper, aluminium, zinc etc.<br>
The dump truck perform a wide variety of rugged tasks. They are designed so that rear of the truck tilts for easy unloading. Generally, it is powered with diesel engines to haul heavier loads and equipped with stronger brakes, power train and suspension system.<br>
The power train transmits power from the engine to the driving wheels. The power train's parts include the transmission, torque converter &amp; axles. The suspension system is a set of hydropneumatic devices that protect a vehicle from the jolts of travel.<br><br>
OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS OF DUMP TRUCK<br>
The dump trucks which are deployed for mining applications are highly capital intensive and it is imperative to maximise productivity to achieve higher operating efficiency. In order to achieve this objective, in mining environment, the dumper has to operate with a high level of safety to the operator &amp; meet requirements of user/ manufacturer. For achieving this, it should have the following features.<br>
1.	To provide soft start by engaging initial gear only when transmission input  speed is less than 1000 rpm.<br>

PRIOR   ART<br>
There are many types of Dump trucks available currently . Some of the relevant prior art constructional details of such Dump trucks are highlighted below.<br>
s.<br>
â– y<br>
I. In the Patent no. WO9405981 a Vehicle-Loaded Weight Displaying Device For Dump Truck Has been disclosed which is shown in Fig . 1 of the drawing accompanying this specification.<br>
The vehicle-loaded weight displaying device for a dump truck (A), comprising a :ontroller (1) for calculating a vehicle-loaded weight from an internal pressure of a luspension cylinder (2), a transmitter (3) for transmitting a vehicle-loaded weight signal m receiving a signal from said controller, a receiver (4) for receiving said vehicle-loaded veight signal and a displaying portion (5) for displaying a vehicle-loaded weight on eceiving a signal from said receiver, said controller and said transmitter being provided &gt;n dump truck(A), while said receiver and said displaying portion on an excavating and oading machine(B). A vehicle loaded weight displaying device for dump truck (A) omprising a controller (1) for calculating a vehicle-loaded weight from an internal iressure of a suspension cylinder (2) and arm type displaying portion adopted to protrude ide-ways from the side of the vehicle body when a signal from the said controller ndicates that a vehicle loaded weight exceeds a predetermined value, said controller and rm-type display portion being provided on a dump truck (A). "he above said system has the following drawbacks<br>
Jot interlocked with hoist control module to have cushioning effect to the loaded dump *uck.<br>
Not interlocked with transmission control module to ensure safe operation of dump truck<br>
even under overloaded condition.<br><br>
Upon abnormality of critical parameters viz. Engine oil  Pressure/ temperature and<br>
transmission oil pressure/temperature for gear inhibition is not provided to avoid damages<br>
to the engine &amp; transmission.<br>
During movement, the raise operation is not inhibited.<br>
Not provided with quick disconnect couplers for easy installation/removal of pressure<br>
sensors from the suspension which needs suspensions to be charged and discharged for<br>
every time of replacement/servicing of pressure sensors.<br>
2. In the patent no CN 88102875 A System for the Gear Change of the Automatic Transmission of Motor Vehicles Controlled with an Electrohydraulic Valve System has been described<br>
According to the invention the process for controlling an automatic transmission wherein engine speed and output speed are measured and slip conditions are derived there from. When condition of downshift occur, as determined by excessively high slip and/or excessively low speed, the conditions existing at the moment of downshift are evaluated, and a comparative slip signal is derived and saved. This signal is employed as reference relating to the momentary slip conditions of the vehicle for use in determining the proper moment for a subsequent up shift. Thus, conditions for an up shift, following a particular downshift, are modified as a function of the circumstances requiring the downshift (e.g. normal deceleration, overtaking another vehicle, ascending a hill). Procedures are also included for enabling engagement of a friction clutch, for bypass the torque converter of the transmission, under certain condition in advance of an up shift.<br>
The above invention has the following drawbacks<br>
Not interlocked with hoist control module to have cushioning effect to the loaded dump<br>
truck<br>
Upon abnormality of Critical parameters viz. Pressures, temperatures for gear inhibition is<br>
not provided to avoid damages to the engine &amp; transmission.<br><br>
fsfot interlocked with limited gear shifting in case of overloading.<br>
On line transmission input and output shaft reading is not provided for checking of shift<br>
Doints trouble shooting.<br>
Vlanual mode operation is not provided which is required in case of fault in auto system.<br>
Vlodulation of UP/DOWN shift point is not provided in order to hunting of gear in slopes.<br>
[nhibition of raise operation during movement is not provided.<br>
?. In another Patent no US4981052 a Transmission control fail safe system has been lescribed which is shown in Fig-2.<br>
n the system an Electrohydraulic control for an automatically shiftable automotive ransmission comprises a selection slide valve (6), at least for the neutral position N, as veil as for the drive mode D and reverse mode R, an electronic control device (7) having ;olenoid valves (8) held in neutral position by spring action, a pressure medium source 9), pressure control and gear control valves (10,11,12) for the actuation of gear :ngagement couplings and brakes (C-H), as well as with a R- gear safety valve(13), for &gt;reventing the shifting into the reverse gear when the forward drive speed is still too high, . system in which, in case of electronic failure, holds or shifts the automatic transmission o one gear insuring that the maximum permissible rotational speed of engine is not xceeded when the vehicle travels at maximum speed, whereby, in the event of failure of tie electronic control device(7) during driving, a control system holds or shifts the gear, nd in the event of failure of the electronic control device(7) before the start or the restart f the engine, this control system(10,l 1,12,13,14) engages a lower gear. This way, in case f electronic failure during travel, travel can be continued unhampered, for instance also in ighest gear, and no shifting down take place. When the electronic device fails at start or t restart after a failure during travel, a lower gear is engaged, wherein it is also possible to tart the engine. 'he drawbacks of the above system are<br><br>
Float signal of hoist system is not interlocked results in adversely effecting the cushioning<br>
effect to the truck body.<br>
When body is up, Reverse gear inhibition is not provided. The body may touch H.T. line<br>
and may lead to accidents.<br>
Not interlocked with limited gear shifting in case of overloading.<br>
Gear inhibition when warning of Critical parameters viz. engine oil Pressure, transmission<br>
oil pressure is not provided which may lead to damage of power line components of the<br>
dump truck.<br>
Inhibition of raise operation during movement is not provided.<br>
In addition to the above draw backs of the above mentioned system / device, our<br>
experience in the field, we have also observed the following drawbacks in the existing<br>
trucks.<br>
The modules occupies more space<br>
Lack of aesthetics and ergonomics<br>
The component count is more thereby making the system unreliable<br>
Power consumption is more, which makes the system uneconomical<br>
Due to variety and multiple modules, spare planning and field servicing becomes difficult.<br>
Use of bulbs to provide individual warning indicators is not reliable as bulbs fail<br>
frequently. In addition they consume more power and generate heat.<br>
The System does not have flexibility to alter to cater the more number of warnings and to<br>
meet customer specific requirements.<br>
Generally, the payload monitoring system is offered as an optional unit for the dump<br>
trucks. In the absence of this system the dump truck can be overloaded which may<br>
result into damage of power line components as well under utilization of the dump<br>
truck may lead to loss of productivity.<br>
Multiplicity in wiring makes difficult to troubleshoot and assembly of variety of modules.<br>
The wiring harness should be of super slim cable to ensure high degree of connectivity<br>
and modular.<br><br>
Since the control and monitoring functions are made in the form of individual module,<br>
The data is not shared among the modules and hence fault in overall equipment operation<br>
is not taken care and also productivity information can not be computed.<br>
With body up, direction travel interlock is not provided. This results in accidents during<br>
reverse travel.<br>
The speed of transmission shaft is measured with respect to vehicle ground, which may<br>
affect due to ambient noise resulting in measurement error.<br>
Separate trouble  shooting tool (Generally referred as  shift checker) is required to<br>
troubleshoot the controller module and check its operation. This makes the system<br>
complicated &amp; cost effective.<br>
There is no provision in the controller to engage the gear manually. This feature is<br>
required to move the equipment to work shop in the event of failure of system<br>
The hunting of gear is observed and predominant if road is of step slopes. The control<br>
algorithm needs modification to prevent such phenomenon.<br>
Soft start is not provided. In the absence of this, jerk will be experience by both operator<br>
&amp; equipment.<br>
Interlock with critical equipment parameters is not provided. Hence equipment may<br>
operate with faults in sub systems leading to catastrophic damage.<br>
No provision to read input and out put speeds of transmission which is required to validate<br>
shift points and help to detect transmission slip. This will help in ascertaining the<br>
condition of the gears in the transmission.<br>
There is a need to address the above mentioned problems / difficulties / drawbacks in the<br>
existing dump trucks considering the following requirements<br>
It is imperative to maximize equipment availability to achieve higher operating<br>
efficiency. Lack of centralised data monitoring, information and communication systems<br>
in the present mining environment are main constraints in accomplishing cost effective<br>
mining.<br><br>
TiM currently available dump trucks have high ownership cost. Any break down and under utilization increases operating expenditure. Also, the vehicle operator is subjected to harsh operating environment such as high temperature, dust, noisy &amp; jerks &amp; hence operator comfort plays an important role in achieving productivity targets. The dump trucks are deployed at remote areas where skilled man power and requisite repair tools are not available. The space available for any cabin components also at high premium due to presence of large mechanical levers and other essential items in the existing dump trucks.<br>
The present invention bridges the above mentioned gaps in the present day dump trucks and provide cost effective solution and also ensures the way the dump trucks should work efficiently and safely in all conditions.<br>
Therefore it is the main objective of the present invention, to provide an Unified Electronic Controller useful for control &amp; monitoring a vehicle, especially Dump trucks system devoid of all the above mentioned drawbacks of the present day available dump trucks<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide an Unified Electronic Controller useful for control &amp; monitoring a vehicle, especially dump trucks safety of operation with minimum break down of the dump truck is ensured.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide a Unified Electronic Controller useful for control &amp; monitoring a vehicle, especially dump trucks vehicle which facilitates maximizing the efficiency of the performance of the vehicle so as to achieve higher operating efficiency.<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to provide an Unified Electronic Controller useful for control &amp; monitoring a vehicle, especially dump trucks which<br><br>
provides centralised data monitoring, information and communication systems which will be useful in the operation of the vehicle to achieve cost effective mining.<br>
-	Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide an Unified Electronic Controller<br>
-	useful for control &amp; monitoring a vehicle, especially dump trucks which minimises operating and maintenance costs.<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to provide an United Electronic Controller useful for control &amp; monitoring a vehicle, especially dump trucks in which the operator of the vehicle is not subjected to harsh operating environment such as high temperature, dust, noisy &amp; jerks consequently the operator is provided with comforts which in turns increases the efficiency.<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to provide a field programmable gate array based device which is useful for incorporation in a field programmable gate array based module which is in turn useful for incorporation in the above said Unified Electronic controller.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide a field programmable gate array based module which is useful for incorporation in the Unified Electronic Controller.<br>
We have developed the present invention based on the principle of Mechatronics. To the best of our knowledge there is no Unified Electronic Controller system useful for control &amp; monitoring a vehicle, especially Dump trucks system devoid of all the above mentioned drawbacks of the present day available dump trucks.<br>
The subject of Mechatronics deals with the integration of precision mechanical engineering with electronics &amp; computer control systems to make intelligent machines. In recent years, the technology of mechatronics has seen remarkable developments particularly in the application of electronics on construction machinery such as dump trucks, dozer, loaders etc. in order to enhance performance, safety, operator comfort and environmental acceptability.<br><br>
. 
The following are the recent trend in mechatronic controls in dump trucks<br>
Transmission control<br>
The total power train management comprises of automatic control of engine, transmission, torque converter and axles. The transmission and torque converter play a critical role in determining equipment performance, life and drive comfort. The conventionally used clutch shift modulating devices are not able to provide optimum clutch engagement under a variety of operational conditions encountered. In view of this, development of low cost, micro controller based unit was introduced to replace hydraulic controls with electrohydraulic controls to provide automated gear shifting.<br>
Anti Lock Braking control (ABS)<br>
While braking, wheels tend to lock if the brake force applied is more than the friction between the road and tyre. This often happens in a panic braking situation, especially on a slippery road. When the front wheels lock, the vehicle slides in the direction of motion. When the rear wheels lock, the vehicle swings around. It is impossible to steer around an obstacle with wheels locked. Locked wheels can thus result in accidents. Skidding also reduces tyre life.<br>
An ABS is an electronically controlled braking system that can assist the driver with the most efficient application of the brakes while skidding .As the name implies, ABS stops the wheel from locking up under heavy braking and prevents the tyre from skidding.<br><br>
Electronic Suspension control<br>
Present hydropneumatic suspensions are optimized for a particular set of operating conditions. Active/semi active suspension controls using electro-hydraulic devices being introduced to control damping co-efficient to match to travel &amp; load conditions to provide superior ride quality.<br>
Electronic Engine control<br>
Electronic engine controls are accepted as standard feature in automotive &amp; trucks. Now, it is slowly inducted in mining &amp; construction equipment. The electronic intelligence, control the amount of fuel &amp; timing to match instantaneous dynamic conditions. This will improve performance in the area of fuel economy &amp; helps in meeting current &amp; future gaseous &amp; noise emission regulations.<br>
Radio Remote controls<br>
A radio remote control system permit safe operation of equipment under conditions which would be hazardous to a human operator. The system comprises receiver on the equipment &amp; a hand held transmitter through which telecommands are initiated. Bulldozers fitted with radio controls are successfully working.<br>
Based on the technology of mechatronics a Field Programmable Gate Array based control<br>
device has been developed which can be incorporated in the UEC of the present invention.<br>

On providing power, the FPGA based device defined above, automatically accesses the instructions serially (37) from serial instruction output device has predefined information and reads the configuration data. Once the configuration data is read the FPGA based - device starts setting up the circuit inside. This process takes few milliseconds. During the configuration process, the microcontroller is kept reset .The solenoid drivers are disabled during the configuration period. If the FPGA (29) device successfully completes the configuration process, reset is released through the microcontroller. The real time clock, which is used in this device, is an internal battery backed. This ensures that the device continues to operate in low power mode in the absence of power.

The solenoid driver accepts logic inputs from the FPGA device and turns the respective solenoids ON or OFF. In case an error is encountered (solenoid open or short circuit), the respective switch is opened and error output is fed back to the FPGA device.

- ground reference signal. With waveform conversion from Sine to Square type.<br>

The brief description of different components of the Unified Electronic Controller of the present invention is given below.<br>
SHIFT RANGE SELECTOR<br>

These sensors have overpressure protection to withstand high ^vels of shock and vibration.<br>
VIRE HARNESS<br>

The Dmbinations of drip proof nylon and mil grade circular connector were used. Colour :&gt;ded super slim cables are used which has helped in easy handling and reduced nlkiness. The wiring harness is set of cable and custom built meant for particular<br><br>

The working of the UEC of the present invention is described below with reference to<br>
dump trucks but it should be kept in mind that the UEC is also useful in other vehicles<br>
also<br>
WORKING DETAILS OF THE UNIFIED ELECTRONIC CONTROLLER(UEC)<br>
UEC system of the present invention integrates the four basic control functions of the rear vehicle trucks, namely<br>
1.	Automated gear transmission<br>
2.	Payload monitoring<br>
3.	Hoist control<br><br>
4. Vehicle parameters monitoring<br>
As depicted in the system as shown in Fig 5.<br>
Dump truck required to perform both mobile &amp; powered functions. The mobile function is required for movement of dump truck &amp; power function for hoist operation. Mobility function is achieved by transmission control &amp; power function is achieved by hoist control (lowering &amp; raising the dump truck body for the purpose of loading &amp; unloading) system. While the dump truck is in continuos operation, vehicle monitoring system will check status of different parameters &amp; prevent impending breakdown. From a safety point the dump truck should not be overloaded &amp; performance point it should not be underloaded which are ensured by Payload monitoring system.<br>
UEC works on alternator - battery supply of 18 - 32 V DC available on the dumpjruck &amp; is protected against reverse polarity, electrical noise caused due to switching of starting motor, horn, wiper, solenoids, etc. Functional working description of above module is given below.<br>
TRANSMISSION CONTROL SYSTEM<br>
One terminal of FPGA is connected to Transmission controller, which is a major functional module which automatically sets the transmission to the optimum gear, in accordance with the position of the shift lever (gear range selection) &amp; control algorithm. Fig. 7 shows various input/output of this system . It accepts critical input parameters like shift lever position (49), transmission input &amp; output speeds (53), throttle position (59), parking brake position (58), body up signal (56), Engine oil pressure (EOP), Transmission oil pressure (TOP), Engine water temperature (EWT), Torque converter oil temperature (TCOT). According to the shift algorithm, it then controls a set of seven solenoid (51) for gear shifting. In addition, when the retarder brake is being used on down hill slopes, the controller catches the signal from the retarder switch, and allows the truck to travel downhill in the most suitable speed range. Gear shifting takes place with reference to the<br><br>
shift set points, derived from optimum operating conditions of power line. In the process of gear shifting, lock up solenoid (61) gets energized or deenergised at a predetermined RPM. This plays a vital role in improving the efficiency and reduces the shift shocks during gear shifting.<br>
The UEC has in built special feature to display real time, input &amp; output transmission speeds, presently engaged gear, error codes (if any) with error message, etc on the display. It also has exhaustive diagnostic features viz. upon power ON, it first checks the electronic circuitry, physical connections of pressure sensors, all solenoid connections &amp; status of warning switches and displays if any error and guides the operator with necessary information for transmission control module, to check solenoids related to gear shifting, autoretarder &amp; lockup solenoid. In case of failure of any solenoids, appropriate action will be initiated &amp; respective fault message will be displayed on the centralized display.<br>
The transmission control module is provided with several interlock features with other functional modules viz. Hoist control, Payload, EVMS, from the point of view of operator &amp; equipment safety. The different interlocks provided for this module are given below:<br>
Body float interlock (for cushioning effect of truck body): if dumper body is not in float,<br>
gear upshifting is inhibited but allowed to travel only in forward 1st gear &amp; reverse. This<br>
will prevent damage to the hoist cylinders.<br>
Body up interlock:  When the truck body is in maximum raise condition, reverse gear is<br>
inhibited but allowed to travel forward 1st gear only. This will prevent accidents while<br>
dumping of the material.<br>
Parking brake interlock: If PARKING BRAKE is applied, transmission will remain in<br>
Neutral, even shift lever moved to any of the drive positions R, D, 5, 4, 3, 2. (top gear<br>
limiting). The parking brake holds the dump truck stationary while it is parked. Parking<br>
brake is sometimes wrongly engaged while equipment in motion. This interlock prevents<br>
such type of faults.<br><br>
Overload interlock: If the truck is overloaded, transmission will remain in neutral even if<br>
shift lever is moved to any drive positions. Hence dumper travel is inhibited till the excess<br>
load is removed. This will prevent vehicle damage due to overloading.<br>
Critical parameter failure interlock:<br>
Related to pressure warnings, if any/combination of warnings EOP &amp; TOP is present, the<br>
transmission forced to N if selector is in position of R,  N, 1. On clearance of the fault,<br>
actuate the gear from neutral gear.  If the same is happens in gear 2 &amp; above, upshift is<br>
prevented but normal downshift w.r.t. transmission input speed is allowed.<br>
Related to temperature warnings, if any/combination of warnings EWT &amp; TCOT is<br>
present, the transmission upshift is prevented but normal downshift w.r.t. input speed is<br>
allowed and dump truck can be operated in default gear. The above specific algorithms are<br>
formulated to meet optimum operating conditions and simultaneously ensuring requisite<br>
level of safety.<br>
Low throttle interlock: When shift tower lever is moved from Neutral to any of the drive<br>
positions (R, D, 5, 4, 3, 2), default gear will be engaged only if transmission input speed is<br>
less nearer to low idle. This will ensure soft start and avoid jerk/shift shock at the time of<br>
vehicle movement.<br>
Neutral start interlock: Gear shifting is inhibited if the engine is cranked in any position of<br>
the shift lever other than N (neutral). This will ensure positive starting of equipment and<br>
avoid accidents.<br>
Different Operations of transmission of the UEC are as follows. Upshift operation<br>
If the gear shift lever is placed at D (drive) position, the 1st gear of the torque converter is used. When accelerator pedal is depressed the engine speed rises. If the speed of the transmission input shaft rises above LOCK UP speed, the lock up clutch is engaged &amp; torque converter is connected directly to the transmission.<br>
When the speed rises to rated speed of engine, the 2nd gear is engaged. This process continues upto maximum allowable gear provided the upshift rpm is reached. If the<br><br>
.selector is fixed at 5th gear position, gear upshifting is permitted upto 5th gear. Similarly for other gear ranges 4th, 3rd &amp; 2nd gears respectively.<br>
The principle behind upshift calculation:<br>
Gear shift points are selected to optimize transmission efficiency in each gear range. Transmission output power against speed is plotted for each gear. Point of intersection of each succeeding power curves are arrived to determine gear upshift points.<br>
Down shift operation<br>
Automatic selection of lower gear to match driving conditions is called downshift. When the load increase and the input shaft speed drops below downshift rpm, the speed range will drop the range below ( for eg.If the running gear is 7l forward gear, it will drop to 6th forward gear).-As the load increases, the speed range will drop in stages to 1st. In this range, if the input shaft speed drops below lock up rpm, the torque converter lock up clutch will be disengaged and machine will revert to the torque converter drive. Therefore the engine will not stall under any conditions. In addition, in the automatic range, the system is designed to prevent sudden changes of speed when changing gear. After the gear is changed, the speed is kept constant for a certain time. This prevents any mistaken operation caused by excessive changes in speed during gear shifting.<br>
In summary downshift operation ensures Shifting to lower gear is prevented until safe lower speed is reached.<br>
Torque Converter &amp; Lock up operation<br>
The torque converter is the vital component that provides smooth gear shifting in automatic transmission systems and it is the connecting element between the engine and the transmission. It serves as a torque multiplier when transmission is driven by high kinetic energy hydraulic oil of torque converter, which is rotated by engine. This mode of<br><br>
operation is called torque converter mode (fluid coupling or converter mode). This mode is required when vehicle is started from rest and for smooth starts and heavy pulling. Whenever torque multiplication is not required, it is bypassed by engaging LOCK UP CLUTCH. In practical sense, it means engine is directly connected to transmission (Direct coupling or Lock up mode).<br>
Lock up clutch is engaged &amp; disengaged depending upon the torque &amp; smooth shift in response to input speed of transmission. It is done thro' lock up solenoid, which gets signal from the controller. Because the torque converter damp many disturbances from engine shocks as well as potholes and road bumps, it is employed during gear shifting. Lock up is not allowed in Neutral &amp; Reverse gear where torque multiplication is necessary.<br>
Autoretarder function<br>
Whenever the engine speed is above over run during travelling, the autoretarder function is initiated by the controller to actuate an air solenoid to apply sudden brake to ensure the safety along with message and appropriate error code.<br>
Over speed<br>
If the transmission input speed exceeds 3000 rpm &amp; above, the UEC system generates a signal to halt the system. The system interrupts the operator to switch off the engine and restart.<br>
Skip Shift operation<br>
When the machine is travelling, it is possible to operate the lever to set the optimum speed position in advance. If this is done, instead of the transmission shifting down one gear at a<br><br>
time, it is possible to make it shift down two or more gears at once. This mode is useful when travelling at high speed and starting to go up a steep hill.<br>
PAY LOAD MONITORING SYSTEM fPLMS)<br>
In this system the four pressure sensors (54) connected to four suspensions of the vehicle is connected to FPGA control module as an input through CN-2 (41).<br>
WEIGHING PRINCIPLE<br>
Multiply by area of cross section gives individual weight on suspension. Sum of four individual weight gives payload.<br>
Dump trucks are provided with hydropneumatic suspensions connected to axle. Once the dumper is loaded, it is transmitted to the axles/tyres thro' four suspensions. The suspensions once charged for proper cushioning effect under no load conditions has a definite static pressure. As the vehicle gets loaded, the pressure on the suspensions increases proportionally. This change in pressure is acquired by the pressure sensors and converts into current from 0 to 20mA range. Based on this current, the electronics in UEC is designed to calculate the payload in the truck body and display provided pre-determined conditions are met.. The Fig 8 illustrates the various input/outputs of this system.<br>
PLMS for trucks assures working of the equipment to its specifications with reference to the payload capacity. This onboard payload monitoring system acts as a payload meter when the truck is stand still &amp; helps to avoid premature failure of the truck components due to overloading or under utilisation of the vehicle. This is the second module incorporated in the UEC system<br>
Basically, this module comprises of four pressure sensors (54) load is transmitted and are connected to suspension oil thro' quick disconnect couplers which are used to fix the pressure sensors. The suspensions are initially filled with hydraulic oil &amp; charged with Nitrogen.   Pressure sensors are connected to 4 suspensions oil port through specially<br><br>
designed quick couplings which will help in easy removal/fitment without discharging of gas in the suspension The system is provided with diagnostic feature to check if any pressure sensors is not connected/defective. It will display that respective sensor is not o.k. / not connected during self diagnostics. Payload monitoring is required only when equipment is under loading. Hence, it is activated only when if it is stationary by checking following three conditions (62).<br>
Truck body should be in FLOAT condition Parking brake should be active Truck should be in Neutral Gear<br>
When the truck meet the above conditions, the payload monitoring system computes, the payload and displayed on centralized LCD display (39). Once equipment travel is initiated PLMS will be deactivated.<br>
CALIBRATION OF PAYLOAD MONITORING SYSTEM<br>
Equipment weighing system<br>
A separate portable Ramp end scale has been developed to calibrate on board electronic payload system. Since this is a portable weighbridge it was deployed in field for calibration and checking of no load/loaded dumper.<br>
DECK LAMP INDICATION (52)<br>
Once the RED lamp starts flashing, the shovel operator is supposed to stop loading. In case, if the operator ignores the RED lamp, the system activate the central warning (57) lamp &amp; buzzer when the load is above the over load limit. Once this happens, the truck can be moved with limited number of gears. With this, payload monitoring is interlocked with transmission gearshift control.<br><br>
Storage and retrieval of productivity information<br>
PLMS also logs the cumulative payload and total cycles the truck is hauled. These values can be viewed on the display thro' keypad operation provided on the front panel of UEC system by invoking the software option to display the details. These are very useful for Productivity management. Even, the system is provided with printer option to take hard copy of these values. It is having the capacity to store large amount of productivity data with option of resetting at the will of operator.<br>
ELECTRONIC VEHICLE MONITORING SYSTEM (EVMS) Various electromechanical switches situated on the vehicle are fed as input to FPGA control module through CN-4 (43).<br>
EVMS performs the health monitoring of vehicle sub systems. It alters operator of impending brake down. Two levels of warning/caution are provided based on severity of the parameters. System checks the vehicle parameter (56) like pressures, temperatures, oil filter   &amp; water level. It also monitors alternator signal to provide input to transmission controller &amp; to log the number of hours, when the Engine is ON. The alternator signal (63) is also used as an interlock signal for few parameters with respect to engine running condition.. Various input/output of this system is shown in Fig 9. The parameters related to pressure, temperature, level &amp; clogging listed below are being monitoring by UEC system. Air pressure, Oil filter s/w, Alternator signal, Engine oil pressure, Engine water temperature, Engine water level, Engine oil temperature<br><br>
Transmission oil pressure, Torque converter oil temperature Brake oil temperature<br>
The system accepts ON/OFF signals from the electromechanical switches fitted on the equipment sub systems related to above signal levels. Whenever the parameters crosses its safe operating limit, the respective switch will turn ON or OFF. If the fault persists for a specified duration, then the SAE symbol corresponding to that parameter is displayed. In case of multiple warnings, the respective symbols will be flashed alternately. A separate Audi/visual warning (57) in addition to the indication provided on LCD (39) is provided to attract the attention of parameter for a few selected warnings.<br>
HOIST CONTROL SYSTEM (HCS)<br>
Three flexi buttons on the UEC control panel is served as input to FPGA control module, the output of FPGA is given to hoist solenoids to control the body of the vehicle through CN-2(41).<br>
The hoist operation (raising of the dumper body for the purpose of unloading) is achieved thro' a set of pneumatic solenoids which are connected for the operation of Lower-Float, Hold &amp; Raise of truck body thro' a telescopic Cylinder which is hydraulically operated. The signals related to these operations are generated by UEC system. Fig 10 shows the constructional features of this system.<br>
The function of HCS is to hoist the truck body up and down. The system can also HOLD the body at any intermittent position between up &amp; down. The hoist system of dumper is an air over hydraulic system, which is activated thro' three pneumatic solenoids (50) viz. Raise, Lower &amp; Float solenoids. The HCS activates/deactivates these solenoids based on the control algorithm &amp; inputs from four switches namely Body up s/w (55), raise s/w, lower-float s/w and Hold s/w. Except body up s/w, other switches are of momentary type which are on the UEC front panel.<br><br>
When the Raise s/w is pressed, the HCS activates the Raise solenoid. Once body reaches maximum up position, Body up limit switch gets activated. This is detected by HCS and it deactivates the Raise solenoid, Body up symbol is displayed on centralized display (39) of UEC.<br>
When Lower/Float switch is pressed, HCS activates Lower solenoid, which down the body. When this switch is released, HCS deactivates the Lower solenoid &amp; activates the Float solenoid. The body then rest in the float position, in which a cushioning effect is provided thro' fluid suspension. When body is in float condition, Body float symbol is displayed on the centralized display. When HOLD is pressed, HCS deactivates all the three hoist control solenoids. This will hold the body at the position in which the hold switch is pressed.<br>
The UEC system built with a diagnostic feature for HCS is that to check whether the hoist solenoids are properly connected or not. In case an error is detected, the system displays the message Hoist control solenoid failure and also with an error code '0'. HCS has interlock with transmission controller. The interlock is Raise operation is inhibited when truck is in any gear other than NEUTRAL &amp; whenever body is up reverse gear is inhibited, and if not in float, upshift beyond default gear is prevented<br>
FRONT PANEL LAYOUT<br>
The front panel layout as in Fig 11 comprises the following;<br>

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE UNIFIED ELECRTONIC CONTROLLER OF THE PRSENT INVENTION &amp; THE PRIOR ART SYSTEMS<br>
Presently the dump trucks are equipped with transmission controller with slow response, a relay based hoist controller, equipment health monitoring system without any proper display and payload monitoring as an optional item. Moreover these are separate modules, which work independently, and there is no interlinking between the different truck functions. The operator has to be alert all the time and has to be skilled to work to ensure safe operation.<br>
UEC has filled this void and enhanced level of sophistication in monitoring and control systems of the dump trucks. For the first time both the electronic hardware and display have been integrated to provide very compact innovative technological solution to the customer.<br>
In order to have flexibility, a graphic colour LCD display is used in the present invention. This feature helps in reduction of the size of the device and also provides scope for additional facilities ,if required , to suit customer special requirements without any difficulty. In the existing system such a possibility is not there.<br>
Unified electronic controller of the present invention monitors a number of parameters by means of suitable transducers and forms a centralized real time information. This data is available to all the above said modules and performance is based on such information to provide desired outputs. The said system has interlocks between the sub modules.<br><br>
With conventional payload monitor, there is a discrepancy of higher order between the loading point and dumping point. The invention has brought down the discrepancy to acceptable level resulting in cost effectiveness &amp; enhanced perfonnance of payload monitor over available PAYLOAD MEASUREMENT units.<br>
ADVANTAGES OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
The overall benefits derived from the invention are:<br>
FPGA BASED CONTROL<br>
UEC controls, monitors and issue appropriate warnings based on the centralized data This<br>
results in lesser component count (and thereby cost), reduced wiring harness complexity<br>
and increased reliability.<br>
The use of integrated FPGA results in the reduced component count which assists in<br>
considerable reduction in printed circuit board area, higher reliability, ease of assembly<br>
and maintenance, and lower inventory costs.<br>
Since the FPGA contains all of the digital functions, the power consumed is very low<br>
compared to the discrete IC based approach and provide superior noise to signal ratio and<br>
system is free from drift with very good repeatability.<br>
This FPGA/ASIC based system will make the electronic module compact and reliable, by<br>
drastically reducing the component count &amp; power dissipation. The system has interlocks<br>
between the four sub modules, which in turn improve safety for the equipment    &amp;<br>
operator.<br>
Safety to operator and equipment<br>
The built in Logic mechanism in the system inhibits gear shifting till engine is started.<br>
Neutral start safety, which ensures the engine to be started only in neutral &amp; prevents gear<br>
shifting if engine is started other than neutral. This ensures positive foolproof equipment<br>
starting.<br><br>
- The system ensures parking brake to be released prior to initiation of travel to prevent damage to parking brake.<br>
The system inhibits reverse travel when body is up to prevent accidents Interlocking of hoist control with gear shifting to inhibit gear shifting upon actuation of Raise of the truck body   during  movement. Also, Upshift beyond 1st gear is permitted only if Float solenoid in ON to have Cushioning effect to the truck body. Improved life to power line aggregates such as transmission, axle and engine System inhibits gear shifting if it is overloaded beyond permissible limit. Hence prevents premature failure of the truck components such as suspension &amp; axle etc. The integration of functional modules has enabled this product to include this feature. Soft start is provided by engaging initial gear only when transmission input speed is near to low idle.<br>
The built in Logic mechanism in the system facilitates Modulation of UP/DOWN shift points to prevent hunting of gears in the slopes.<br>
The System provides overload indication to shovel operator thro' RED lamps placed outside the truck cabin.<br>
The System provides a method to correct the discrepancy in Payload both at loading point and at dumping point. Online diagnostics facility<br>
Display of on-line transmission input/out speeds, is provided for troubleshooting The System has self-diagnostics &amp; on-line test facility makes troubleshooting easy. Major components Throttle switch, parking brake, retarder brake &amp; shift lever position can be checked without any external meter. Generally a separate troubleshooting device is developed for electronic module to study and identify the cause of malfunctioning. Here this feature is built in to the system to validate control functions ON-LINE at any point of time. This feature makes service function easy and does not call for additional device resulting in reduced cost and burden which makes service engineer job easy and friendly. The built in System to display of warning code with message description in text form in<br><br>
case of failure of system components or wrong operation sequence. With this operator<br>
need not refer any book and quickly check &amp; take necessary action.<br>
The built in system provided for checking the gear solenoids both at open &amp; short circuit<br>
conditions<br>
The built in System built provides self test facility to check the Pressure sensors for PLMS<br>
electronically as well for physical connections.<br>
Introduction of quick couplers for the suspension oil port to connect the pressure sensor<br>
without discharging the gas in the suspension.<br>
Fail safe features<br>
In case of loss of engine/transmission oil pressures or high temperature, predetermined action is initiated to avoid damage to equipment<br>
In the case of component failure such as solenoid, speed sensor, the safe<br>
action on equipment is initiated from the UEC, to prevent damage to equipment. Display<br>
Liquid crystal display used Instead of providing number of display indicators, a high resolution colour single graphic LCD is used to provide centralised vehicle information &amp; monitoring. This will avoid strain operator and cuts viewing time.<br>
Display of SAE Warning Symbols for vehicle parameters (warnings) -16 symbols, through 320x240 graphic LCD module helps in localization of fault. The built in System provides for payload read out as well as bar graph display to indicate the payload in the truck Redundancy in system<br>
Provision for Manual mode of operation: In the event of failure of UEC hardware or any of the subsystems interfaced to it (like Shift Tower, speed sensors etc), the operator can still take the truck to workshop by switching over to the Manual Mode provided in the UEC. This feature is not available in other models and any malfunctioning/failure of a component in the system makes dump truck totally immobile causing panic to the operator and mining staff. Lot of efforts are required to take the equipment out of road whereas in UEC dumper can be moved to safe area at any point of time at the will of operator.<br><br>
-    Frinter interface<br>
System built with RS232 printer interface to take hard copy of the print of above<br>
productivity parameters<br>
Higher reliability<br>
The use of FPGA technology results in lower component count and power dissipation,<br>
leading to higher reliability and, thereby, higher mean time between failures (MTBF),<br>
lesser manufacturing, and inventory and testing costs.<br>
In short the Unified Electronic controller will have great potential to be interfaced with<br>
GPS based computerised mine management as it is having centralised data of entire<br>
equipment functional parameters.<br>
Condition based maintenance management/Scheduling can be performed with the help of<br>
ON line display of speeds and gear engaged.<br>
Computation of productivity of individual equipment and benchmarking<br><br><br>
