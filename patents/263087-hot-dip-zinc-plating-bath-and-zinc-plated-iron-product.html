TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
HOT DIP ZINC PLATING BATH AND ZINC-PLATED IRON PRODUCT<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to hot-dip galvanizing. More particularly, the<br>
invention relates to a galvanizing bath which produces a uniform alloy layer, and a<br>
galvanized iron article produced using the galvanizing bath.<br>
Hot-dip galvanizing has been widely applied to iron and steel materials because<br>
an alloy layer of Zn and Fe contained in an iron article is formed to exhibit excellent<br>
adhesion, and excellent corrosion resistance is provided due to a sacrificial anode effect.<br>
A galvanized coating includes an FeZn7 (Fe: 7 to 11%) hexagonal ä1 alloy layer<br>
formed on the underlying iron, an FeZn13 (Fe: about 6%) æ (zeta) alloy layer formed on<br>
the ä1 alloy layer and having a columnar structure belonging to a monoclinic system,<br>
and an ç zinc layer formed on the æ alloy layer and having a dense hexagonal structure.<br>
The æ alloy layer in such a galvanized coating structure is important for<br>
increasing the thickness of the galvanized coating. On the other hand, since the æ alloy<br>
layer has a columnar structure, the æ alloy layer has a low degree of symmetry as<br>
compared with other layers. If the thickness of the æ alloy layer is nonuniform,<br>
corrosion resistance may decrease, or the galvanized coating may become fragile.<br>
Moreover, since the æ alloy layer is whitish as compared with the zinc layer, the<br>
appearance of the coating is impaired when the æ alloy layer is partially formed near the<br><br>
surface of the galvanized coating.<br>
JP-A-2004-285387 discloses technology of adding Al to a bath in an amount of<br>
0.10 to 0.6% in order to improve the appearance of the galvanized coating. This<br>
technology aims at forming a Zn-Al-Fe ternary alloy layer.<br>
JP-A-4-154950 discloses an Fe-Zn alloy galvanizing bath containing 0.1 to 10%<br>
of Fe.<br>
JP-A-63-247331 discloses a colored hot-dip galvanizing zinc alloy containing<br>
0.2 to 0.7% of Ti.<br>
JP-A-63-247332 discloses an iridescent hot-dip galvanizing zinc alloy<br>
containing 0.1 to 0.8% of Mn.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
Some aspects of the invention mainly aim at causing an alloy layer of a hot-dip<br>
galvanized coating to become uniform, and provide hot-dip galvanizing baths capable of<br>
producing a hot-dip galvanized coating exhibiting an excellent appearance and<br>
galvanized iron articles.<br>
Hot-dip galvanizing baths according to some aspects of the invention comprise<br>
0.005 to 0.2 mass% of Cu. The hot-dip galvanizing bath according to one aspect of the<br>
invention comprises 0.001 to 0.1 mass% of Al in addition to Cu, with the balance being<br>
Zn and unavoidable impurities. The hot-dip galvanizing bath according to another<br>
aspect of the invention further comprises 0.05 to 5.0 mass% of Bi in addition to Cu, Al,<br>
Zn. and the unavoidable impurities. The hot-dip galvanizing bath according to still<br>
another aspect of the invention further comprises 0.001 to 0.1 mass% of Sn in addition<br>
to Cu, Al, 2'n, Bi, and the unavoidable impurities. The hot-dip galvanizing bath<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENT<br>
An object of the invention is to provide a hot-dip galvanizing bath which<br>
provides excellent corrosion resistance and appearance, and a galvanized iron article.<br>
The inventors of the invention have conducted extensive studies on the<br>
relationship between the composition of a hot-dip galvanizing bath and a æ alloy layer to<br>
achieve the invention.<br>
The inventors have melted an electrolytic zinc ingot (zinc ingot subjected to<br>
electrolytic refining) in a furnace, and gradually added an Al alloy to the zinc ingot.<br>
As a result, the inventors have found that formation of the æ alloy layer is promoted<br>
when the Al content is 0.001 to 0.1 mass% ("mass%" is hereinafter simply indicated by<br>
"%"), and the æ alloy layer changes from an FeZn13 (Fe: about 6%) alloy layer into an<br>
Fe-Zn-Al ternary alloy layer when the Al content exceeds 0.1 %.<br>
When adding Al to the hot-dip galvanizing bath, Al forms a very thin aluminum<br>
oxide film on the surface of the Ç zinc layer to improve corrosion resistance. It was<br><br>
found that it is desirable to add Al to the galvanizing bath in an amount of 0.001 to<br>
0.1%.<br>
Although the addition of a small amount of Al allows the æ alloy layer to be<br>
easily formed during immersion of an iron article in the galvanizing bath to increase the<br>
thickness of the galvanized coating, a reaction proceeds during air cooling until the<br>
galvanized article removed from the galvanizing bath is subjected to the next step,<br>
whereby the thickness of the columnar structure varies to a large extent. An uneven<br>
metallic gloss occurs if the columnar structure is partially formed near the surface of the<br>
galvanized coating, whereby the appearance tends to deteriorate.<br>
A phenomenon in which the columnar structure varies to a large extent also<br>
occurs when using a Zn-Pb galvanizing bath containing 1 to 2% of Pb or a Zn-Bi<br>
galvanizing bath containing 0.1 to 3.0% of Bi instead of Pb from the environmental<br>
point of view (Pb free).<br>
The inventors have conducted extensive studies on a component which<br>
eliminates the variation in the columnar structure of the æ alloy layer. As a result, the<br>
inventors have found that the thickness of the æ alloy layer can be made uniform and the<br>
following remarkable effects can be obtained by adding Cu in an amount of about 0.005<br>
to 0.2%.<br>
First, the surface gloss of the galvanized coating is improved by adding Cu to<br>
the hot-dip galvanizing bath.<br>
Second, the æ alloy layer formed when immersing the iron article in the hot-dip<br>
galvanizing bath can be suppressed within a specific range, and the growth of the æ alloy<br>
layer can be suppressed when transferring the galvanized article removed from the<br>
galvanizing bath in the air (air cooling). As a result, the variation in the columnar<br>
structure formed of the æ alloy layer can be suppressed to provide a æ alloy layer with a<br>
uniform thickness, and dripping and retention of the galvanizing solution can be<br>
suppressed, whereby the appearance and the gloss can be made uniform.<br><br>
Accordingly, a hot-dip galvanizing bath according to the invention comprises<br>
0.005 to 0.2 mass% of Cu.<br>
The upper limit of Cu is set at 0.2% because peeling easily occurs when the Cu<br>
content exceeds 0.2%. If the Cu content is less than 0.005%, the effect of addition of<br>
Cu is not obtained.<br>
If the Cu content is increased, a suspended dross tends to adhere to the surface<br>
of the galvanized article when removing the galvanized article from the galvanizing<br>
bath. Therefore, the Cu content is preferably 0.005 to 0.08% from the viewpoint of the<br>
stability of the appearance. The Cu content is more preferably 0.01 to 0.08% from the<br>
viewpoint of easily suppressing the formation of the æ alloy layer during air cooling.<br>
In this case, the surface gloss of the galvanized coating is improved by adding Al<br>
in an amount of 0.001 to 0.1%. Moreover, a very thin alumina film is formed on the<br>
surface of the galvanized coating, whereby a primary rust prevention performance is<br>
improved.<br>
When Al is added in an amount exceeding 0.1%, the galvanized coating tends to<br>
form an Fe-Zn-Al ternary alloy in spite of the effect of addition of Cu.<br>
If the Al content in the hot-dip galvanizing bath is less than 0.001%, a Zn oxide<br>
film is formed on the surface of the bath. The Zn oxide film may adhere to the surface<br>
of the galvanized article when removing the galvanized article from the bath, whereby<br>
the surface of the galvanized article may become clouded. Therefore, the Al content is<br>
preferably 0.003% or more in order to prevent the formation of the Zn oxide film. If<br>
the Al content in the bath is too high, the thickness of the alumina layer formed on the<br>
surface of the bath increases to a large extent, whereby the alumina layer tends to adhere<br>
to the surface of the galvanized article when introducing the galvanized article.<br>
Therefore, the Al content is preferably 0.003 to 0.02%.<br>
In recent years, in order to obtain a stable feather-like crystal on the coating<br>
surface, to prevent dripping of the galvanizing solution, and to improve adhesion, a<br><br>
Zn-Bi galvanizing bath has been proposed which has a reduced environmental impact.<br>
In this case, the hot-dip galvanizing bath preferably comprises 0.05 to 5.0% of<br>
Bi, 0.005 to 0.2% of Cu, and 0.001 to 0.1% of Al.<br>
The Cu content must be 0.005% or more in order to cause the æ alloy layer to<br>
have a uniform columnar structure. The Cu content is ideally 0.01 to 0.08%.<br>
The Zn-Bi-Al-Cu galvanizing bath according to the invention may be a<br>
galvanizing bath which does not substantially contain other components. Alternatively,<br>
a trace element may be added depending on the required quality, such as adding Sn in<br>
an amount of about 0.001 to 0.1%, for example.<br>
If the Bi content is less than 0.05%, the effect of addition is not obtained.<br>
Since Bi is more expensive than Zn, the Bi content is preferably 5.0% or less.<br>
When the galvanizing target article is an iron article such as a steel sheet, since<br>
the amount of rust on the surface of the iron article is relatively small, the galvanized<br>
coating exhibits excellent adhesion to the iron article. The effect of suppressing<br>
dripping or retention of the galvanizing solution is remarkably achieved with a Bi<br>
content of 0.12 to 2.5%. The Bi content is ideally 0.12 to 0.3%.<br>
When the galvanizing target article is a cast iron article with a relatively large<br>
amount of surface rust, it is desirable to form a Bi layer at the bottom of the galvanizing<br>
furnace so that the operation of removing dross from the bottom of the furnace is<br>
facilitated. Therefore, the Bi content is preferably 0.2 to 2.0%.<br>
The Bi content is preferably 0.05 to 0.3% when it is desired to maintain an<br>
excellent surface gloss.<br>
The effect of adding Cu according to the invention is also achieved when using a<br>
Zn-Pb galvanizing bath.<br>
In this case, the galvanizing bath comprises 0.05 to 3.0% of Pb, 0.005 to 0.2% of<br>
Cu, and 0.001 to 0.1% of Al, with the balance being Zn.<br>
A galvanized iron article which has been galvanized using the galvanizing bath<br><br>
according to the invention has a æ alloy layer with a uniform thickness and exhibits<br>
excellent corrosion resistance and appearance.<br>
In this case, the ç zinc layer in the surface portion of the galvanized coating<br>
contains 0.005 to 0.2% of Cu.<br>
Since the hot-dip galvanizing bath according to the invention comprises Cu in an<br>
amount of 0.005 to 0.2%, and preferably 0.01 to 0.08%, the growth of the æ alloy layer<br>
is suppressed during air cooling until the galvanized article removed from the<br>
galvanizing bath is subjected to the next step so that the columnar structure becomes<br>
uniform. As a result, the thickness of the alloy layer and the thickness of the<br>
galvanized coating become uniform. Moreover, the hot-dip galvanizing bath exhibits<br>
an excellent covering power and provides excellent corrosion resistance and<br>
appearance.<br>
The addition of Cu also increases the surface gloss of the galvanized coating and<br>
improves primary rust prevention performance.<br>
The invention is described below based on experimental data. Note that the<br>
invention is not limited thereto.<br>
Each galvanizing bath having the composition shown in the table in FIG. 1 was<br>
prepared. A sheet material made of SS400 and having dimensions of 70 mmx150<br>
mmx3.2 mm (thickness) was hot-dip galvanized.<br>
The baiance of the composition shown in the table in FIG. 1 is Zn.<br>
The average thickness of the galvanized coating of the test sample was about 60<br>
urn. The sample was subjected to a neutral salt spray test of a plated coating corrosion<br>
resistance test in accordance with JIS Z2371, and the amount of wear due to corrosion<br>
was measured from the difference between the weight before the test and the weight at<br>
each specific elapsed time.<br>
The results are shown in the graph in FIG. 2.<br>
The galvanizing bath shown in FIG. 1 with which the sample No. 1 was formed<br><br>
was prepared by melting only an electrolytic zinc ingot. The sample using only<br>
electrolytic zinc exhibits the most excellent corrosion resistance. However, the<br>
galvanized coating exhibits inferior mechanical properties to some extent and tends to<br>
have an inferior appearance due to an insufficient surface gloss or dripping or retention<br>
of the galvanizing solution.<br>
A change in corrosion resistance due to the addition of Al, Cu, and Bi was<br>
investigated. The corrosion resistance deteriorated when adding only Bi (sample No.<br>
2). On the other hand, the corrosion resistance was improved by adding Al or Cu in<br>
addition to Bi, as is clear from the results of the sample No. 3 (Bi+Al) and the sample<br>
No. 4 (Bi+Cu).<br>
The corrosion resistance achieved when adding Cu and Al to electrolytic zinc<br>
(sample No. 5) was higher than that when adding only Bi, and the surface gloss of the<br>
coating was improved by the addition of Cu.<br>
The corrosion resistance was also improved when adding Cu and Al to<br>
electrolytic zinc to which Bi was added (sample No. 6).<br>
In the hot-dip galvanizing bath according to the invention, the content of Cd as<br>
an unavoidable impurity is 10 ppm or less so that the environmental impact can be<br>
reduced. It is also possible to reduce the content of Pb as an unavoidable impurity to<br>
50 ppm or less.<br>
The effects of components added to the hot-dip galvanizing bath on the<br>
galvanized coating structure was investigated.<br>
An electrolytic zinc ingot was melted in an iron furnace, and the bath<br>
temperature was adjusted to 450°C.<br>
As unavoidable impurities, the Bi content was 0.004%, the Pb content was 20<br>
ppm or less, and the Cd content was 5 ppm or less. The Al content was less than<br>
0.001%.<br>
A steel sheet was immersed in the galvanizing bath for two minutes. The steel<br><br>
sheet was then removed from the galvanizing bath and cooled with water. FIG 3A<br>
shows a micrograph of the cross section of the resulting galvanized coating.<br>
The galvanized coating contained a 61 alloy layer formed on the underlying iron,<br>
a æ alloy layer formed on the ä1 alloy layer, and an ç zinc layer formed on the surface<br>
side.<br>
FIG. 3B shows a micrograph of the cross section of a galvanized coating<br>
obtained in the same manner as described above except for using a galvanizing bath to<br>
which Al was added in an amount of 0.013%.<br>
As shown in FIG. 3B, formation of the æ alloy layer was promoted so that the<br>
thickness of the æ alloy layer was increased.<br>
FIG. 3C shows a micrograph of the cross section of a galvanized coating<br>
obtained using the above Al-containing galvanizing bath to which Cu was added in an<br>
amount of 0.039%.<br>
As shown in FIG. 3C, formation of the æ alloy layer was suppressed by the<br>
addition of Cu so that the thickness of the æ alloy layer became uniform.<br>
Moreover, the galvanized coating exhibited excellent mechanical properties and<br>
an excellent surface gloss, and dripping or retention of the galvanizing solution rarely<br>
occurred.<br>
FIG. 4 shows experimental results when adding Bi to a galvanizing bath which<br>
did not contain Cu and to which Al was added in an amount of 0.01%.<br>
FIG. 4A shows a micrograph of the cross section of a galvanized coating<br>
obtained using a galvanizing bath to which Bi was added in an amount of 0.63%, and<br>
FIG. 4B shows a micrograph of the cross section of a galvanized coating obtained using<br>
a galvanizing bath to which Bi was added in an amount of 1.94%.<br>
The thickness of the æ alloy layer was increased by the addition of Bi.<br>
However, the variation in thickness was very large.<br>
FIG. 4C shows a micrograph of the cross section of a galvanized coating<br><br>
obtained using a galvanizing bath to which Cu was added in an amount of 0.082%.<br>
As shown in FIG. AC, the thickness of the æ alloy layer became uniform by the<br>
addition of Cu in the same manner as in the example shown in FIG. 3C.<br>
The composition of the bath was again analyzed. The galvanizing bath<br>
contained 2.359% of Bi, 0.082% of Cu, and 0.014% of Al, with the balance<br>
substantially being Zn.<br>
The above effect of addition of Cu was also observed when using a Zn-Pb<br>
galvanizing bath. FIG. 5 shows a micrograph of the cross section of a galvanized<br>
coating obtained using the Zn-Pb galvanizing bath.<br>
As shown in FIG. 5, the æ alloy layer was uniformly formed. The galvanizing<br>
bath contained 0.88 to 0.91% of Pb, 0.036% of Cu, and 0.017% of Al, with the balance<br>
substantially being Zn.<br>
In order to investigate the cause of the change in the galvanized coating structure<br>
due to the addition of Al, Cu, and Bi in detail, a change in the galvanized coating<br>
structure with respect to the element added was observed using a microscope with the<br>
passage of time in the air (air-cooling time) (unit: second) after removing the galvanized<br>
article from the hot-dip galvanizing bath.<br>
FIGS. 6 to 9 show the photographs obtained. In FIGS. 6 to 9, the term<br>
"electrolytic zinc ingot" refers to a state in which an electrolytic zinc ingot was melted<br>
and no element was added.<br>
FIGS. 11 to 19 show measurement data of the total thickness of the galvanized<br>
coating (i.e., alloy layers (æ+ä1) and ç layer) based on the micrographs. FIGS, 10A and<br>
10B shows surface analysis results of the cross sections of the galvanized coating<br>
obtained when adding Al to the galvanizing bath and the galvanized coating obtained<br>
when adding Cu to the galvanizing bath.<br>
Al tends to precipitate near the surface of the coating, and Cu is relatively<br>
uniformly dispersed in the coating.<br><br>
A change in the galvanized coating structure was investigated. As shown in<br>
FIG. 11, when using a galvanizing bath prepared by melting only an electrolytic zinc<br>
ingot, the thickness of the alloy layer changed to only a small extent between the<br>
air-cooling time of 5 seconds and the air-cooling time of 15 seconds. FIGS. 12A to<br>
12D and FIGS. 13A to 13C show changes in the galvanized coating structure when<br>
adding Al to the galvanizing bath. As a result of comparison at an air-cooling time of<br>
5 seconds, the thickness of the alloy layer was about 25 urn when the Al content was<br>
0.006% (see FIG. 12A), and the thickness of the alloy layer was increased as the Al<br>
content was increased, as shown in FIGS. 12B to 12D and FIGS. 13A to 13C. The<br>
thickness of the alloy layer exceeded 30 urn when the Al content was 0.062% (see FIG.<br>
12C). The same tendency was observed at an air-cooling time of 30 or 60 seconds (see<br>
FIGS. 13B and 13C).<br>
As shown in FIG. 12D, the thickness of the alloy layer changed to a large extent<br>
when the Al content was 0.123%. This is considered to be because the alloy layer<br>
formed a Zn-Fe-Al ternary alloy layer, as shown in the micrograph.<br>
The thickness of the alloy layer was increased and became nonuniform by the<br>
addition of Al.<br>
As shown in FIG. 7, FIGS. 14A to 14D, and FIGS. 15A and 15B, the growth of<br>
the alloy layer during air cooling was suppressed by the addition of Cu so that the alloy<br>
layer remained uniform.<br>
For example, when the Cu content was 0.0065% (see FIG. 14B), the thickness of<br>
the Ç layer was changed to only a small extent during air cooling.<br>
As the effect of Cu during immersion in the galvanizing bath, while the<br>
thickness of the alloy layer was 25 to 28 um when the Cu content was 0.011% (see FIG.<br>
14A), the thickness of the alloy layer was reduced to about 20 µm when the Cu content<br>
was 0.175% (see FIG 14D).<br>
Regarding the effects of addition of Al and Cu, as shown in FIG 8, FIGS. 16A to<br><br>
16D, and FIGS. 17A and 17B, the thickness of the alloy layer was increased during<br>
immersion in the galvanizing bath by the addition of Al, and the growth of the alloy<br>
layer was suppressed during air cooling by the addition of Cu so that the ç layer was<br>
uniform and the coating had a surface gloss.<br>
As is clear from the data shown in FIG. 9, FIGS. 18A to 18D, and FIGS. 19A<br>
and 19B, the alloy layer was grown during air cooling by the addition of Bi so that the<br>
alloy layer became nonuniform.<br>
The above investigation results confirmed that the æ alloy layer is made uniform<br>
by adding Cu to the hot-dip galvanizing bath, and the uniformity is improved by<br>
suppressing the growth of the æ alloy layer during air cooling (during transfer in the air)<br>
after removing the galvanized article from the galvanizing bath.<br>
Since the galvanizing bath according to the invention produces a galvanized<br>
coating which has high uniformity and a gloss and improves primary rust prevention<br>
performance and corrosion resistance, the galvanizing bath according to the invention<br>
can be utilized as an excellent hot-dip galvanizing method for iron articles.<br>
Although only some embodiments of the invention have been described above in<br>
detail, those skilled in the art would readily appreciate that many modifications are<br>
possible in the embodiments without materially departing from the novel teachings and<br>
advantages of the invention. Accordingly, such modifications are intended to be<br>
included within the scope of the invention.<br><br>
