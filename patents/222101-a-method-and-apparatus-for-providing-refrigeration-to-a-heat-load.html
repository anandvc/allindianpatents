				<td>SYSTEM FOR PROVIDING CRYOGENIC REFRIGERATION<br>
Technical Field<br>
This invention relates generally to low<br>
temperature or cryogenic refrigeration and, more<br>
particularly, to pulse tube refrigeration.<br>
Background Art<br>
The cooling, liquefaction and/or subcooling or<br>
densification of certain gases such as neon, hydrogen<br>
or helium requires the generation of very low<br>
temperature refrigeration. For example, at atmospheric<br>
pressure neon liquefies at 27.IK, hydrogen liquefies at<br>
20.39K, and helium liquefies at 4.21K. The generation<br>
of such very low temperature refrigeration is very<br>
expensive. Inasmuch as the use of fluids such as neon,<br>
hydrogen and helium are becoming increasingly important<br>
in such fields as energy generation, energy<br>
transmission, and electronics, any improvement in<br>
systems for the liquefaction of such fluids would be<br>
very desirable.<br>
A recent significant advancement in the field of<br>
generating low temperature refrigeration is the pulse<br>
tube system wherein pulse energy is converted to<br>
refrigeration using an oscillating gas. Such systems<br>
can generate refrigeration to very low levels<br>
sufficient, for example, to liquefy helium. However,<br>
such refrigeration generated by pulse tube systems is<br>
very costly if the starting point is a relatively high<br>
temperature such as ambient temperature.<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of this invention to<br>
provide a system for providing cryogenic refrigeration<br>
using a pulse tube system which can more efficiently<br>
provide such refrigeration than can heretofore<br>
available systems using pulse tube technology.<br>
Summary Of The Invention<br>

apparent to those skilled in the art upon a reading of<br>
this disclosure, are attained by the present invention,<br>
one aspect of which is:<br>

load comprising:<br>
(A) compressing pulse tube gas to produce hot<br>
compressed pulse tube gas, cooling the compressed pulse<br>
tube gas, and expanding the cooled pulse tube gas to<br>
produce cold pulse tube gas;<br>
(B) warming the cold pulse tube gas by indirect<br>
heat exchange with heat transfer medium to produce<br>
cooled heat transfer medium, and warming the cooled<br>
heat transfer medium by indirect heat exchange with<br>
refrigeration fluid to produce cooled refrigeration<br>
fluid at a first temperature within the range of from<br>
10 to 28OK; '<br>
(C) providing refrigeration into the cooled<br>
refrigeration fluid to produce cold refrigeration fluid<br>
at a second temperature lower than said first<br>
temperature and within the range of from 3 to 150K; and<br>

refrigeration into the refrigeration fluid downstream<br>
of the forecooling heat exchanger; and<br>
(D) a heat load and means for passing<br>
refrigeration from the refrigeration fluid into the<br>

Detailed Description<br>
The invention will be described in detail with<br>
reference to the Drawings. Referring now to Figure 1,<br>
pulse tube refrigerator 40 comprises regenerator body<br>
41 and pulse tube body 1 having pulse tube heat<br>
exchanger 42. Regenerator 41 contains pulse tube gas<br>
which may be hydrogen, neon, nitrogen, a mixture of<br>
helium and neon, a" mixture of neon and nitrogen, or a<br>
mixture of helium and hydrogen. Mixtures of helium and<br>
hydrogen are preferred.<br>
A pulse, i.e. a compressive force, is applied to<br>
the hot end of regenerator body 41 by means of pulse<br>
generator 43 thereby initiating the first part of the<br>
pulse tube sequence. Preferably the pulse is provided<br>
by a piston which compresses a reservoir of pulse tube<br>
gas in flow communication with regenerator body 41.<br>
Another preferred means of applying the pulse to the<br>
regenerator is by the use of a thermoacoustic driver<br>
which applies sound energy to the gas within the<br>
regenerator. Yet another way for applying the pulse is<br>
by means of a linear motor/compressor arrangement. Yet<br>
another means to apply pulse is by means of a<br>
loudspeaker. Another preferred means to apply pulse is<br>
by means of a travelling wave engine. The pulse serves<br>
to compress the pulse tube gas producing hot compressed<br>
pulse tube gas at the hot end of the regenerator body<br>
41. The hot pulse tube gas is cooled by indirect heat<br>
exchange with heat transfer fluid 33 in heat exchanger<br>
44 to produce warmed heat transfer fluid in stream 34<br>
and to produce cooled compressed pulse tube gas for<br>
passage through the remainder of the regenerator body.<br>
Examples of fluids useful as the heat transfer fluid in<br>
the practice of this invention include water, air,<br>
ethylene glycol and the like.<br>
The regenerator body contains heat transfer media.<br>
Examples of suitable heat transfer media in the<br>
practice of this invention include steel balls, wire<br>
mesh, high density honeycomb structures, expanded<br>
metals, lead balls, copper and its alloys, complexes of<br>
rare earth element(s) and transition metals.<br>
The heat transfer media is at a cold temperature,<br>
generally within the range of from 10 to 280K at the<br>
cold end to 200 to 310K at the warm end, having been<br>
brought to this cold temperature in the second part of<br>
the pulse tube sequence' which will be described more<br>
fully below. As the cooled compressed pulse tube gas<br>
passes through the regenerator body, it is further<br>
cooled by direct contact with the cold heat transfer<br>
media to produce warmed heat transfer media and further<br>
cooled pulse tube gas, generally at a temperature<br>
within the range of from 9 to 279K at the cold end to<br>
199 to 309 at the warm end.<br>
The further cooled pulse tube gas is passed from<br>
the regenerator body 41 to pulse tube body 1 at the<br>
cold end and is expanded through pulse tube heat<br>
exchanger 42. As the further cooled pulse tube gas<br>
passes into pulse tube body 1 at the cold end it<br>
generates a gas pressure wave which flows toward the<br>
warm end of pulse tube body 1 and compresses the gas<br>
within the pulse tube, termed the pulse tube working<br>
fluid, thereby heating the pulse tube working fluid.<br>
Cooling fluid 35 is passed to heat exchanger 36<br>
wherein it is warmed or vaporized by indirect heat<br>
exchange with the pulse tube working fluid, thus<br>
serving as a heat sink to cool the pulse tube working<br>
fluid. Resulting warmed or vaporized cooling fluid is<br>
withdrawn from heat exchanger 36 in stream 37.<br>
Preferably cooling fluid 35 is water, air, ethylene<br>
glycol or the like.<br>
Attached to the warm end of pulse tube body 1 is a<br>
line having orifice 38 leading to reservoir 39. The<br>
compression wave of the pulse tube working fluid<br>
contacts the warm end wall of the pulse tube body and<br>
proceeds back in the second part of the pulse tube<br>
sequence. Orifice 38 and reservoir 39 are employed to<br>
maintain the pressure and flow waves in phase so that<br>
the pulse tube generates net refrigeration during the<br>
expansion and the compression cycles in the cold end of<br>
pulse tube body 1. Other means for maintaining the<br>
pressure and flow waves in phase which may be used in<br>
the practice of this invention include inertance tube<br>
and orifice, expander, linear alternator, bellows<br>
arrangements, and a work recovery line with a mass flux<br>
suppressor. In the expansion sequence, the pulse tube<br>
gas expands through pulse tube heat exchanger 42 to<br>
produce cold pulse tube gas at the cold end of the<br>
pulse tube body 1. The expanded gas reverses its<br>
direction such that it flows from the pulse tube body<br>
toward regenerator body 42.<br>
The pulse tube gas emerging from pulse tube heat<br>
exchanger 42 is passed to regenerator body 41 wherein<br>
it directly contacts the heat transfer media within the<br>
regenerator body to produce the aforesaid cold heat<br>
transfer media, thereby completing -the second part of<br>
the pulse tube refrigerant sequence and putting the<br>
regenerator into condition for the first part of a<br>
subsequent pulse tube refrigeration sequence.<br>
In the practice of this invention the pulse tube<br>
body contains only gas for the transfer of the pressure<br>
energy from the expanding pulse tube gas at the cold<br>
end for the heating of the pulse tube working fluid at<br>
the warm end of the pulse tube. That is, pulse tube<br>
refrigerator 40 contain no moving parts such as are<br>
used with a piston arrangement. The operation of the<br>
pulse tube without moving parts- is a significant<br>
advantage of this invention. The pulse tube may have a<br>
taper to aid adjustment of the proper phase angle<br>
between the pressure and flow waves. In addition, the<br>
pulse tube may have a passive displacer to help in<br>
separating the ends of the pulse tube. Furthermore,<br>
the pulse tube will have a connecting line between the<br>
pulse tube warm end and pressure wave line 45,<br>
replacing the orifice and reservoir with a mass flux<br>
suppressor such as a bellows arrangement to recover<br>
lost work.<br>
Heat transfer medium is passed in line 7 to pump 4<br>
and from there is pumped through line 5 to pulse tube<br>
heat exchanger 42 wherein it is cooled by indirect heat<br>
exchange with the cold pulse tube gas which was<br>
expanded into pulse tube body 1 from regenerator body<br>
41. Examples of heat transfer medium suitable for use<br>
in the practice of this invention include helium, neon,<br>
hydrogen, atmospheric gases such as nitrogen, argon and<br>
air, hydrocarbons such as methane, ethane, ethylene,<br>
liquefied natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas,<br>
fluorocarbon's and hydrofluorocarbons such as carbon<br>
tetrafluoride and fluoroform, selected fluoroethers and<br>
hydrofluoroethers, and mixtures comprising one or more<br>
of the above.<br>
Resulting cooled heat transfer medium is passed<br>
from pulse tube heat exchanger 42 in line 6 to<br>
forecooling heat exchanger 30 wherein it is warmed<br>
serving to cool by indirect heat exchange refrigeration<br>
fluid passed to heat exchanger 30 in line 13. The<br>
warmed heat transfer medium is withdrawn from<br>
forecooling heat exchanger 30 in line 7 and<br>
recirculated back to the pulse tube refrigerator as was<br>
previously described.<br>
In the embodiment of the invention illustrated in<br>
Figure 1 the system used to provide lower level<br>
refrigeration to the refrigeration fluid is a multiple<br>
component refrigeration system wherein a multiple<br>
component refrigeration fluid recirculating in a<br>
circuit undergoes compression and expansion steps and<br>
delivers refrigeration to a heat load. In this<br>
embodiment the multicomponent refrigeration fluid<br>
preferably comprises at least one atmospheric gas<br>
preferably nitrogen, argon and/or neon, and preferably<br>
at least one fluorine containing compound having up to<br>
six carbon atoms such as fluorocarbons,<br>
hydrofluorocarbons, hydrochlorofluorocarbons,<br>
fluoroethers and hydrofluoroethers, and/or at least one<br>
hydrocarbon having up to five carbon atoms.<br>
Referring back now to Figure 1, compressed<br>
refrigeration fluid 13, which in this embodiment is a<br>
multicomponent refrigeration fluid, is cooled to a<br>
first temperature within the range of from 10 to 280K<br>
by passage through forecooling heat exchanger 30 by<br>
indirect heat exchange with the aforediscussed warming<br>
heat transfer medium. Resulting cooled refrigeration<br>
fluid 14 is further cooled by passage through heat<br>
exchanger 31 and resulting refrigeration fluid stream<br>
15 undergoes expansion through an expansion device,<br>
such as Joule-Thomson valve 16, to generate<br>
refrigeration. The refrigeration provided to the<br>
refrigeration fluid by the expansion through valve 16<br>
results in the establishment of cold refrigeration<br>
fluid 17 at a second temperature, which is lower than<br>
the first temperature, and is within the range of from<br>
3 to 150K. The cold refrigeration fluid 17 is passed<br>
to heat exchanger 32 wherein it is warmed thereby<br>
passing refrigeration from the cold refrigeration fluid<br>
to heat load 3. Examples of the uses of the<br>
refrigeration passed into heat lead 3 include<br>
superconducting cable cooling, industrial gas<br>
liquefaction, reliquefaction, propellant densification,<br>
air separation, and cryogenic gas separation.<br>
The resulting warmed refrigeration fluid 18 is'•<br>
further warmed by passage through heat exchanger 31 and<br>
then resulting stream 19 is still further warmed by<br>
passage through forecooling heat exchanger 30 wherein<br>
it assists in the cooling of the refrigeration fluid<br>
down to the first temperature. Resulting refrigeration<br>
fluid 20 from heat exchanger 30 is compressed to a<br>
pressure generally within the range of from 50 to 2000<br>
pounds per square inch absolute (psia) in compressor<br>
10. Compressed refrigeration fluid 11 is cooled of the<br>
heat of compression by passage through cooler 12 and<br>
resulting compressed refrigeration fluid 13 is passed<br>
to forecooling heat exchanger 30 and the refrigeration<br>
cycle repeats.<br>
Figures 2 and 3 illustrate other preferred<br>
embodiments of the invention. The numerals in Figures<br>
2 and 3 are the same as those of Figure 1 for the<br>
common elements and these common elements will not be<br>
discussed again in detail. Figure 2 illustrates an<br>
embodiment wherein lower level refrigeration is<br>
provided to the refrigeration fluid using a Brayton<br>
refrigerator and Figure 3 illustrates an embodiment<br>
wherein lower level refrigeration is provided to the<br>
refrigeration fluid using a magnetic refrigerator.<br>
Referring now to Figure 2, Brayton system working<br>
fluid is compressed in Brayton system compressor 70 and<br>
the heat of compression is removed (not shown).<br>
Resulting refrigeration fluid 13 is desuperheated in<br>
heat exchanger 30 by returning stream 19 and by stream<br>
6 to the first temperature. Resulting stream 14 is<br>
further desuperheated in heat exchanger 31 and expanded<br>
isentropically by Brayton system expander 71 to<br>
generate refrigeration and cool the refrigeration fluid<br>
or Brayton system working fluid to the second<br>
temperature. Resulting working fluid 17 provides<br>
refrigeration to heat load 3 in heat exchanger 32 and<br>
is then returned to the suction of Brayton system<br>
compressor 70.<br>
Referring now to Figure 3, magnetic refrigerator<br>
100 comprises magnetizable material bed 101, moveable<br>
strong electromagnet or superconducting magnet 102,<br>
pistons 103 and 104, a cold heat exchanger 105 and a<br>
hot heat exchanger 106. Examples of magnetizable<br>
material which can be used in the practice of this<br>
invention include GdNi2, GdZn2, GdTi03, Gd2Nii7, GdAl2,<br>
GdMg, GdCd, Gd4C03, GdGa, Gd5Si4, and GdZn. The void<br>
space surrounding the magnetic bed particles in bed 101<br>
and the volumes in piston cylinders 107 and 108 are<br>
filled with working fluid, examples of which include<br>
helium, neon, nitrogen, argon, methane,<br>
carbontetrafluoride fluorocarbons, hydrofluorocarbons,<br>
fluoroethers and hydrofluoroethers.<br>
At the beginning of the cycle cold heat exchanger<br>
105 is initially at a low temperature and hot heat<br>
exchanger 106 is at a warmer temperature. Magnet 102<br>
is used to magnetize bed 101. The magnetocaloric<br>
effect causes each magnetic particle in bed 101 to warm<br>
slightly. Pistons 103 and 104 are moved to their<br>
extreme right position causing the enclosed working<br>
fluid, e.g. helium gas, to flow from the left cylinder<br>
107, through cold heat exchanger 105, magnetic<br>
refrigerator bed 101 and hot heat exchanger 106 to fill<br>
the volume in cylinder 108. The particles in bed 101<br>
are cooled by the flowing gas, and the gas in turn is<br>
warmed. Heat from the gas is transferred to cooling<br>
water as the gas flows through hot heat exchanger 106.<br>
When the pistons have reached their extreme right<br>
position the gas flow is stopped and the magnetic field<br>
is removed, cooling bed 101 by the magnetocaloric<br>
effect. Pistons 103 and 104 are moved back to their<br>
extreme left positions causing the helium gas to flow<br>
from cylinder 108, through hot heat exchanger 106,<br>
magnetic refrigerator bed 101 and cold heat exchanger<br>
105 into cylinder volume 107. The helium gas is cooled<br>
by direct heat exchange as it passes through bed 101,<br>
and is warmed in cold heat exchanger 105 as it provides<br>
refrigeration into cooled refrigeration fluid to<br>
produce the cold refrigeration fluid at the second<br>
temperature which is further processed as was<br>
previously described. In this embodiment the<br>
refrigeration fluid is passed through the refrigeration<br>
fluid circuit by operation of pump 72.<br>
In Table 1 there is tabulated the calculated<br>
energy requirements, in kilojoules per kilogram, to<br>
cool helium to 4.3K using each of the three illustrated<br>
embodiments of the invention wherein the pulse tube<br>
refrigerator generates refrigeration from 300K to 50K<br>
and each of the multicomponent refrigerant cycle (A),<br>
Brayton refrigerator (B) and magnetic refrigerator (C)<br>
generate the refrigeration from 50K to 4.3K. For<br>
comparative purposes there is also shown, as<br>
comparative example D, the energy requirements for<br>
going from 300K to 4.3K using only a pulse tube system.<br>
As can be seen, the hybrid refrigeration system of this<br>
invention with the upstream pulse tube refrigerator<br>
enables a significant reduction in the energy<br>
requirements for the provision of comparable<br>
refrigeration over systems which employ only pulse tube<br>
refrigeration.<br>
Although the invention has been described in<br>
detail with reference to certain preferred embodiments,<br>
those skilled in the art will recognize that there are<br>
other embodiments of the invention within the spirit and the scope of the claims.<br><br><br><br><br>
