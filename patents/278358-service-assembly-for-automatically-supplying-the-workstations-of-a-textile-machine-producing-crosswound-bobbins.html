I, ASTRID TERRY, Translator of 11 Bounds Oaks Way, Tunbridge Wells, Kent, TN4 0UB, confirm that I am familiar with the English and German languages, and that to the best of my knowledge and belief the accompanying document which has been prepared by me, is a true translation of the authentic text of the Document on the filing of the Patent Application File No. 10 2006 007 922.1 dated 21st February 2006.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
The invention relates to a service assembly for automatically supplying the workstations of a textile machine producing cross-wound bobbins according to the preamble of claim 1.<br>
Service assemblies which automatically supply workstations of textile machines producing cross-wound bobbins have been known for a long time and are described in detail in various patent applications. Different embodiments of such service assemblies are known in this case, as well as various methods regarding how service assemblies of this type can be advantageously used to optimally supply the workstations of the textile machines. For example, it is not novel in this context for a plurality of respective identically configured service assemblies to be used simultaneously on a textile machine producing cross-wound bobbins. Textile machines producing cross-wound bobbins are described in DE 199 30 644 Al, DE 101 48 330 Al or EP 0 308 711 Al, in which in each case at least two service assemblies operate on each of the two machine sides.<br>
The utilisation of the service assemblies used is highly dependent on the respective yarn parameters, in particular on the yarn count and the yarn material, and may change substantially from yarn batch to yarn batch.<br>
In the case of fine yarns, which can be spun from first-class feed material, one service assembly for each machine side of the textile machine can be completely sufficient, while in the case of coarse yarns, in particular when the feed material is less good, two service assemblies for each machine side of the textile machine can be well utilised.<br>
It is also known to configure and/or arrange the service assemblies in such a way that a service assembly which needs maintenance, for example, can be positioned in such a way that the operation of the remaining service assemblies is not hindered.<br>
-2-<br>
 <br>
In DE 36 02 961 Al or DE 199 30 644 Al, service assemblies are described, for example, which can be moved along the workstations of the textile machine during regular operation by means of a chassis on rails, which are fixed on a superstructure of the textile machine. The service assemblies in this case have a base body which is displaceably mounted relative to their chassis and can be displaced, if necessary, into a maintenance position in such a way that the various operating elements of the service assembly arranged on the base body are freely accessible. The service assembly positioned in a maintenance position does not, in this case, hinder the supply of workstations of the textile machine by the other service assemblies.<br>
DE 101 30 467 Al further discloses the extending of running rails for service assemblies of this type, also designated operating travellers beyond the actual working region and thereby providing a special service position.<br>
Operating travellers which need maintenance can be parked in this service position without operation of the other operating travellers being impaired.<br>
The known service assemblies are generally supplied with energy by means of a so-called drag chain device. In other words, a drag chain device of this type, in addition to a cable for electrical energy, generally has at least one hose to supply compressed air and data lines. The drag chain, approximately in the centre of the textile machine, is fastened by one end to a connection point and connected by its opposing end to a cable carriage. The cable carriage runs in a separate travelling lane above the drag chain and is connected to the service assembly by means of a drawbar. In other words, the service assembly moves the cable carriage by means of the drawbar and said cable carriage rolls or unrolls the drag chairii The disadvantage in this arrangement, which has proven successful per se is, however, that both the drawbar and the various energy and data lines are connected to the service assembly in such a way that mounting the service assembly on the textile machine or dismantling it therefrom can only be carried out by trained specialist personnel, for example fitters and/or electricians. Mounting a service assembly on a<br>
-3-<br>
 <br>
textile machine or dismantling it therefrom is also relatively complex and therefore relatively time-consuming.<br>
In the Japanese disclosure application 56-3261, a moveable displacement device is also described, which can be moved along one of the head sides of textile machines on rails and with the aid of which a tube changer can be displaced from one textile machine to another textile machine. The displacement device has a device, which allows the tube changer to be received on a textile machine, transported to another textile machine and then transferred thereto. The displacement device, for this purpose, has a telescopic rail system, which, if necessary, can be coupled to the stationary running rails of a textile machine in such a way that continuous rail lines are produced, by means of which the tube changers can be pushed onto the displacement device or by means of which the tube changers can be transferred from the displacement device to another textile machine. However, no indications can be inferred from JPOS 56-3261, as to what type of energy supply the tube changer has or how the energy supply of this operating traveller is dealt when the tube changer is moved.<br>
Proceeding from the aforementioned prior art, the invention is based on the object of developing assemblies, which are configured in such a way that, if necessary, they can be used flexibly. In other words, the service assemblies should be configured such that, if necessary, the number of service assemblies which are active at a textile machine producing cross-wound bobbins can be adapted in a rapid and uncomplicated manner to the requirements of the respective textile machine.<br>
This object is achieved according to the invention by service assemblies, as described in claim 1.<br>
Advantageous configurations of the invention are the subject of the sub-claims.<br>
-4-<br>
 <br>
The service assemblies configured according to the invention have the advantage, in particular, that they can easily be moved from one textile machine producing cross-wound bobbins to another textile machine producing cross-wound bobbins, if necessary. The personnel required for moving in this case do not have to have any special knowledge, in other words, no special technical people are required to move these service assemblies, such as, for example, fitters or electricians. The service assembly according to the invention may, instead, after the removal of an easily releasable coupling device arranged in the connection region of drawbar/service assembly and the pulling of some plug connections which are connected to the energy or data lines and easily accessibly positioned on the upper side of the service assembly, easily be removed from the textile machine by means of a maintenance aid and transferred to another textile machine, where the service assembly can be installed again just as easily and made ready for operation.<br>
As described in claim 2, it is provided in an advantageous embodiment that the drawbars, by means of which the service assembly is connected to a cable carriage which can be moved on the superstructure of the textile machine, are connected by means of locking bolts, which are secured by locking springs, to a crossbar of the superstructure of the service assembly. This means that after pulling the locking springs, the locking pins can easily be disassembled and the drawbars can be separated from the service assembly without problems.<br>
It is not necessary to have special knowledge nor does a special tool have to be used for an action of this type.<br>
The configuration described in claims 3 and 4, in which connection plugs are arranged at the end of the pneumatic and electrical energy supply lines and the data lines and correspond with corresponding connection sockets on the service assembly, in various sectors, in particular electrical engineering, is the best proven connection possibility, which is also easy and safe to handle even by non-technical people.   Different connection plugs or connection sockets ensure in this case, that<br>
-5-<br>
 <br>
confusions in the energy or data lines cannot occur, in particular in the case of reconnection of the service assembly.<br>
As described in claim 5, it may also be provided in an advantageous embodiment that a switching means is arranged in the electrical energy supply line. In other words, by actuating this switching means, the electrical plug connection can be disconnected and can be separated or joined at any time without danger.<br>
Correspondingly, in an advantageous embodiment, a valve is connected in the pneumatic compressed air line (claim 6). By actuating this valve, the compressed air line can easily be disconnected and the plug connection can then be separated or joined without problems.<br>
As described in claim 7, the service assembly furthermore has switches, which allow coding of the control device of the service assembly. In other words, it can be set, for example, at these switches, in which of the, for example, four working regions of the textile machine producing cross-wound bobbins the service assembly is to work after it has been moved.<br>
The maintenance aid described in claim 8, for moving a service assembly, in an advantageous embodiment, has a support frame which is fixed on a movable lifting truck, for example, and is equipped with eye hooks which correspond with corresponding attachment means on the service assembly. To remove the service assembly from the running rails of a textile machine producing cross-wound bobbins, as described above, the coupling device of the drawbars merely has to be released, the energy and data lines separated by pulling the plug connections, the lifting carriage with its support frame pushed over the service assembly and the eye hooks hooked in attachment means arranged on the service assembly. Then, optionally after removal of some mounting parts, for example two rollers, the service assembly can be lifted without problems from its running rails, transported to another textile machine and easily connected there to the running rail thereof.  After<br>
-6-<br>
 <br>
joining the plug connections and the coding of the working area, the service assembly is ready for operation again at the new textile machine.<br>
As indicated in claim 9, the support frame in which the service assembly can be hooked for transport, can obviously also be handled by a transporting means other than a lifting truck. A fork-lift truck may also be used, for example, which transports the support frame with the hooked-in service assembly from one textile machine to another textile machine.<br>
The invention will be described in more detail below with the aid of an embodiment shown in the drawings, in which:<br>
Fig. 1 shows a side view of a workstation of a textile machine producing cross-wound bobbins with a service assembly, which is easily removably arranged on running rails of the textile machine,<br>

Fig. 4 shows a perspective view of the drawbar of the cable carriage of the drag chain device,<br>

-7-<br>
 <br>
Fig. 1 shows a side view of one half of a textile machine producing cross-wound bobbins, in the present case an open-end rotor spinning machine 1. Textile machines of this type have/ as Known, a large number of similar workstations 2, which, inter alia, in each case have an open-end spinning mechanism 3 and a winding device 4.<br>
Fibre band 6, which is stored in spinning cans 5, is spun into threads 7 at these workstations 2, which1 are then wound on the winding devices 4 to form cross-wound bobbins 8. As indicated in Fig. 1, the winding devices 4 are equipped with a creel 9 for rotatably holding a cross-wound bobbin rube,- and with a winding roller 11 for driving the cross-wound bobbins 8 by frictional engagement. The creel 9 is in this case mounted so as to at least be rotatable to a limited extent about a pivot axis 15. Open-end rotor spinning machines 1 of this type generally also have a cross-wound bobbin transporting device 12 for the disposal of the complete cross-wound bobbins 8, in other words, cross-wound bobbins 8, which have reached their provided diameter. Automatically operating service assemblies 16, which, during spinning operation, patrol along the workstations 2 of the open-end rotor spinning machine 1 and automatically intervene when action is needed at one of the workstations 2, are arranged so as to be movable on corresponding running rails 10 or 20 at or on the oper»-end rotor spinning machine 1. A need for action of this type is present, for example, if, at one of the workstations 2, one of the cross-wound bobbitvs % has reached its specitied diameter and has. to be exchanged for a new cross-wound bobbin tube.<br>
Service assemblies of this type described, for example in DE 35 43 572 C2, have a large number of handling elements, which are known per se and described in detail in the patent application mentioned above. The showing of these known handling elements has been dispensed with in the figures of the present patent application for the sake of clarity.<br>
The service assemblies 16 are supplied both with electrical and with pneumatic energy by means of a so-called drag chain device 51.  The service assemblies 16 are<br>
-8-<br>
 <br>
also connected to a central control unit 17 of the open-end rotor spinning machine 1 by means of the drag chain device 51 or corresponding data lines 32, 33. The drag chain device 51, as indicated in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, has a drag chain channel 52, which is preferably divided into two drag chain rolling paths 53A and 53B running in parallel. Two separate drag chains 49 are guided one behind the other in each of these drag chain rolling paths 53A and 53B if the textile machine 1 is designed for using two service assemblies 16 for each machine side. The drag chains 49 are in each case fixed by one end to a connection point 50 arranged approximately in the centre of the open-end rotor spinning machines 1 and by their opposing end, in each case, to a cable carriage 24, which is displaceably installed on one of the drag chain rolling paths 53A or 53B of the drag chain channel 52. Cable carriages 24 are in turn respectively connected by means of a drawbar 23 to a crossbar 34 of one of the service assemblies 16.<br>
The drawbar 23 is in this case easily releasably connected to the crossbar 34 of the service assembly 16 by means of a mechanical coupling device 22. Details of these coupling devices will be described below with the aid of Fig. 3 and 4. As indicated in Fig. 3, the energy and data lines 30 - 33 embedded in the drag chains 49 are laid in the cross sectionally hollow drawbar 23 in such a way that the energy and supply lines 30 - 33 can be releasably fixed to the crossbar 34 of a service assembly 16.<br>
Both the pneumatic energy supply line 30 and the electrical energy supply line 31 each have in this case, at the end, a connection plug 40 or 41, which corresponds with a corresponding connection socket 36 or 37 at the service assembly 16. Accordingly, the data lines 32 and 33 are also equipped with connection plugs 42 or 43, which can be fixed in associated connection sockets 38 or 39. In other words, the energy lines and the data lines 30 - 33 are in each case connected to the individual service assemblies 16 by means of easily releasable plug connections 25 - 28.<br>
-9-<br>
 <br>
As also indicated in Fig. 1, attachment means 19 are also provided on the service assembly 16 and facilitate the transportation of the service assembly 16 by a maintenance aid 21 (shown in Fig. 5).<br>
A textile machine 1 producing cross wound bobbins is schematically shown in a plan view in Fig. 2. Textile machines of this type, as known, have a plurality of workstations 2 arranged next to one another in series between their end frames 13 and 14.<br>
These workstations 2 arranged on either side of the longitudinal sides of the machine of the open-end spinning machine 1 are supplied, in the embodiment, by service assemblies 16A, 16B, 16C, which, as described above, are guided on running rails 10, 20 and their control devices are connected, for example, by means of a machine bus 18, both to one another and to the central control unit 17 of the textile machine 1. The service assemblies 16 are in this case supplied by means of a drag chain device 51 generally arranged above the textile machine 1 in the region of the longitudinal centre axis of the textile machine 1.<br>
In other words, cable carriages 24 to which drag chains 49 are connected in each case, are displaceably mounted in the drag chain rolling paths 53A and 53B of a drag chain channel 52. The drag chains 49 are also fixed by their opposing ends to connection points 50, which are arranged approximately in the centre of the textile machine 1. Energy supply lines 30 and 31 and data lines 32, 33, which can be connected by means of the cable carriage 24 and the drawbar 23 of the cable carriage 24 to the service assembly 16, are embedded in the drag chains 49. In other words, the energy supply lines 30 and 31 running in the drag chains 49 and the data lines 32, 33 are connected to the service assembly 16 by means of plug connections 25 - 28.<br>
Fig. 3 schematically shows a plan view of the coupling region 22 of a service assembly 16.  A drawbar 23 rotatably connected to a cable carriage 24 is in this case<br>
-10-<br>
 <br>
connected, if necessary easily releasably, to the crossbar 34 of a service assembly 16 by means of locking pins 29, which are secured by spring elements 35.<br>
As can be seen, a pneumatic energy supply line 30, by means of which compressed air can be supplied, an electrical energy supply line 31 and a data line 32 and 33 are arranged inside the drawbar 23 configured for example, as a hollow square pipe. The aforementioned lines, which in each case carry different connection plugs 36 -39 at the end, correspond to correspondingly configured connection sockets 40 - 43 of the service assembly 16.<br>
In other words, the connection plugs 36 - 39 and the connection sockets 40 - 43 form easily accessible plug connections 25 - 28 which can easily be released if necessary. A valve 45 is preferably also connected into the pneumatic energy supply line 30, by means of which valve the plug connection 25 can be disconnected. Furthermore, a switching means 44 is preferably incorporated into the electrical energy line and allows the plug connection 26 to be disconnected if necessary. The relevant service assembly 16 can also be adjusted to the working region, which the service assembly 16 is to supply on the new textile machine, by means of the coding switch 54.<br>
A drawbar 23 is perspectively shown in Fig. 4, by means of which the energy and the data lines 30 - 33 can be transferred from the drag chain device 51 to a service assembly 16. The drawbar 23, which has a hollow profile, is connected by means of a pivot pin 59 to a cable carriage 24 which, as already described above, is displaceably mounted in one of the drag chain rolling paths 53A or 53B. Clamping means 60 for fixing the energy or data lines 30 - 33 are provided inside the drawbar 23. A connection head 57, which can in turn be connected to the crossbar 34 of the service assembly 16 by means of locking pins 29 which are easily releasable if necessary, is also connected to the drawbar 23 by means of a swivel pin 58. The locking pins 29 are in this case secured in their installation position by locking springs 35.<br>
-11 -<br>
 <br>
The embodiment of a maintenance aid 21 shown in Fig. 5 substantially consists of a support frame 48 with eyelet hooks 47.<br>
The support frame 48 is, for example, fixed oh the platform 56 of a lifting truck 46, which, as known, can be adjusted in the vertical direction V. The lifting truck 46 is also equipped with a moving mechanism 55 and can therefore be positioned, if necessary, at each of the workstations 2 of one of the textile machines 1 in such a way that the eye hooks 47 can be hooked without problems in the attachment means 19 of a service assembly 16. This means that each of the service assemblies 16, after releasing the coupling device 22 and pulling the plug connections 25 - 28 can be removed in the shortest time from the running rails 10 of a textile machine 1 even by personnel who do not have to have any special technical knowledge and transported, as necessary, to another textile machine 1, where the service assembly 16 is also installed again without problems and can be made ready for operation.<br>
