				<td>The present invention relates to devices for packaging<br>
and applying a substance, in particular a cosmetic, e.g.<br>
makeup or a care product, the device including an applicator<br>
and a wiper member for wiping an applicator member.<br>
Numerous known devices have relatively rigid wiper<br>
members that are liable in the long run to damage the<br>
applicator member, in particular when the applicator member<br>
has bristles or flocking.<br>
European patent application EP—A1—1 050 231 and<br>
international application WO 93/01736 describe wiper members<br>
having flaps that can be folded to facilitate inserting the<br>
applicator member in the receptacle containing the substance.<br>
Patent applications EP-A1-0 627 182, EP-A1-1 481 607, and<br>
US 2003/0196672 disclose wiper members having slots that<br>
facilitate deformation of the wiper member while the<br>
applicator member is being inserted into and/or extracted from<br>
the receptacle containing the substance. Such devices can<br>
lead to wiping that is not entirely satisfactory.<br>
Patent application FR 2 753 058 discloses a wiper member<br>
comprising a sleeve configured to hold a reserve of substance<br>
by a surface tension effect. The section of the sleeve is<br>
constant over its entire length extending along the<br>
longitudinal axis.<br>
US patent No. 4 433 928 teaches using an adjustable wiper<br>
member, in particular a member that is adjustable to the<br>
height of the neck of the receptacle containing the substance<br>
for application.<br>
Finally, patent application EP—A1—0 728 426 discloses a<br>
wiper member capable of deforming elastically when the<br>
applicator member passes therethrough.<br>
There exists a need to further improve devices for<br>
packaging and applying a substance, and in particular to<br>
benefit from a wiper member capable of wiping a wide variety<br>
of applicator members in satisfactory manner, in particular<br>
applicator members presenting a cross-section that is<br>
relatively large compared with the cross-section of the stem<br>
2<br><br>
and/or that are relatively fragile, e.g. because they include<br>
bristles or flocking.<br>
There also exists a need to leave a more uniform load of<br>
substance on applicator members that may present a very wide<br>
variety of cross-sections.<br>
There also exists a need for a wiper member that can<br>
easily be mounted on the corresponding receptacle.<br>
There also exists a need to avoid the piston effect when<br>
the applicator member is taken out from the receptacle.<br>
In one of its aspects, the invention provides a device<br>
for packaging and applying a substance, in particular a<br>
cosmetic, makeup, or a care product, the device comprising:<br>
•	a receptacle for containing the substance;<br>
•	an applicator member; and<br>
•	a wiper member secured to the receptacle to wipe the<br>
applicator member as it leaves the receptacle, the wiper<br>
member comprising at least one wiper lip having a radially<br>
inner free edge defining an orifice through which the<br>
applicator member passes, the perimeter of the free edge being<br>
strictly greater than the perimeter of the orifice observed in<br>
projection from above, e.g. because of the. presence of<br>
undulations. The perimeter of the free edge may be greater<br>
than the perimeter of the stem that is to be wiped, for<br>
example.<br>
In one of its aspects, the invention also provides a<br>
device for packaging and applying a substance, in particular a<br>
cosmetic, makeup, or a care product, the device comprising:<br>
•	a receptacle for containing the substance;<br>
•	an applicator member; and<br>
•	a wiper member secured to the receptacle to wipe the<br>
applicator member as it leaves the receptacle, the wiper<br>
member comprising at least one undulating wiper lip having a<br>
radially inner free edge defining an orifice through which the<br>
applicator member passes.<br>
The device may include an applicator comprising a stem<br>
with the applicator member being secured to one end thereof.<br>
The presence of undulations enables the wiper lip to<br>
deform more easily as the applicator member passes<br>
3<br><br>
therethrough while it is being inserted into the receptacle<br>
and/or taken out therefrom, but without thereby losing its<br>
ability to wipe the applicator member in satisfactory manner,<br>
and it can also serve to reduce the piston effect.<br>
The invention also makes it easier to provide a wiper<br>
member capable of adapting to an applicator member presenting<br>
relatively large amounts of variation in its cross-section,<br>
while nevertheless also wiping the stem that supports said<br>
applicator member.<br>
By way of example, the applicator member may present a<br>
maximum transverse dimension that is greater than the diameter<br>
of the portion of the stem that is wiped, when said portion is<br>
circular in section.<br>
Depending on the general orientation of the wiper lip<br>
relative to the direction in which the applicator member is<br>
inserted and taken out, the wiper member may deform more<br>
easily, e.g. during insertion or while the wiper member is<br>
being taken out.<br>
For example, it is thus possible to arrange the wiper lip<br>
in such a manner that it deforms more easily while the<br>
applicator member is being returned into the receptacle than<br>
while it is being taken out. For example by having a wiper<br>
lip that is generally converging towards the bottom of the<br>
receptacle, it is possible to obtain relatively thorough<br>
wiping of the applicator member on each use, while reducing<br>
the risk of damage while the applicator member is being<br>
returned into the receptacle.<br>
The wiper member may be more flexible than at least a<br>
portion of the applicator member that comes into contact<br>
therewith.<br>
At rest, the diameter of the wiper member may be close to<br>
that of the stem, and when the applicator member is inserted<br>
through the wiper member, the undulations of the wiper lip<br>
deploy, thereby making it easier to enlarge the orifice<br>
defined by the wiper lip so as to allow the applicator member<br>
to pass through, but without that generating excessive<br>
pressure that might cause damage.<br>
4<br><br>
The term "undulations" should be understood as<br>
designating a sequence of indentations and/or projections<br>
formed by the wiper lip when going around its circumference.<br>
They may be curved in shape or they may be in the form of<br>
folds that are alternately concave and convex on going round<br>
the circumference. Each undulation of the wiper lip may<br>
extend, when the wiper lip is observed from above, along an<br>
axis that is oriented radially. All of the axes of the<br>
undulations may intersect substantially at the center of the<br>
orifice defined by the wiper lip.<br>
The axes of the undulations may be oriented substantially<br>
perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the device or they<br>
may substantially occupy a cone, which cone may converge or<br>
diverge towards the bottom of the receptacle.<br>
At least one undulation of the wiper lip may be oriented<br>
along a curvilinear or rectilinear line that is not concentric<br>
about the longitudinal axis of the device, and in particular<br>
that is radial.<br>
The wiper lip need not have any ribs and/or slots, for<br>
example slots extending parallel to the longitudinal axis of<br>
the device or slots extending perpendicularly to the<br>
longitudinal axis of the device, or indeed slots that are<br>
inclined relative to the longitudinal axis of the device. In<br>
particular, unlike certain prior art wiper members, the wiper<br>
member need not have any slots that are substantially closed<br>
when at rest and that extend longitudinally.<br>
The undulations of the wiper member may vary in amplitude<br>
and in number. The wiper member may, for example, have two to<br>
12 undulations, or four to ten undulations, or indeed five to<br>
nine undulations. They may be distributed regularly or<br>
irregularly. They may all have the same amplitude, or in a<br>
variant they may be of different amplitudes.<br>
Two adjacent undulations may present profiles that are<br>
different.<br>
Advantageously, the free edge of the wiper lip, when not<br>
under stress, does not extend entirely in one plane.<br>
The wiper lip may occupy a midplane that is substantially<br>
perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the device, or it<br>
5<br><br>
may generally occupy a cone, either a cone that converges<br>
towards the bottom of the receptacle, or a cone that converges<br>
towards the outlet from the receptacle.<br>
The thickness of the wiper member may be constant, or in<br>
a variant its thickness may vary. For example it may be<br>
thinner at points closer to its free edge and thicker at<br>
points further away from its free edge.<br>
In the circumferential direction and at a given distance<br>
from the longitudinal axis of the device, the wiper member may<br>
present a thickness that is substantially constant, e.g.<br>
varying by less than 10% on one complete revolution. However<br>
its thickness may vary on going towards the longitudinal axis.<br>
The thickness of the wiper lip may lie in the range<br>
0.1 millimeters (mm) to 0.8 mm, for example. More<br>
particularly, it may be about 0.2 mm at the free edge and<br>
about 0.5 mm at points of the wiper lip that are further from<br>
the free edge, e.g. at the periphery of the wiper lip.<br>
The wiper lip may deploy under thrust from the applicator<br>
member, possibly prior to stretching in elastic manner.<br>
During deployment of the wiper lip, its undulations may tend<br>
to flatten out, with the wiper lip being observed from the<br>
center of the orifice it defines.<br>
The orifice of the wiper member may be configured to have<br>
an aptitude for passing from a small diameter suitable for<br>
wiping the stem to a larger diameter enabling the applicator<br>
member to be wiped, without necessarily relying on significant<br>
elongation of the material constituting the wiper lip.<br>
The orifice of the wiper lip may be circular, or in a<br>
variant it may be non-circular, e.g. oval, elliptical, kidney-<br>
shaped, or polygonal, e.g. square or rectangular. The shape<br>
of the orifice may be selected as a function of the shape of<br>
the cross-section of the stem and as a function of the manner<br>
in which the applicator is taken out from the receptacle, for<br>
example whether it turns about its own axis or not.<br>
The wiper lip may deform more than the applicator member<br>
while the applicator member is passing through the orifice.<br>
6<br><br>
The total height of the wiper member, measured along the<br>
longitudinal axis of the device may be greater than that of<br>
the wiper lip and it may remain substantially constant in use,<br>
in particular when the applicator member is taken out from the<br>
receptacle or is introduced therein.<br>
The wiper lip may press against the stem at at least two<br>
distinct levels along the longitudinal axis of the device, for<br>
example in a manner that is discontinuous in the<br>
circumferential direction in the vicinity of the extrema of<br>
the undulations.<br>
The cross-section of the stem of the applicator may be<br>
substantially constant at least over a major fraction of the<br>
length of its portion that comes into contact with the wiper<br>
lip while the applicator is being taken out. Under such<br>
circumstances, the section of the orifice defined by the wiper<br>
lip may correspond substantially to the outside cross-section<br>
of said portion of the stem. The stem may present a distal<br>
portion that tapers in the proximity of the applicator member,<br>
and in particular a distal portion that is conical, which can<br>
improve the quality of wiping.<br>
The applicator member may comprise at least one of: a<br>
brush with an optionally-twisted core, a comb, a tuft of<br>
bristles implanted in the stem to form a paint brush, a<br>
spatula, flocking, a foam, and felt.<br>
The applicator member may, for example, comprise a brush<br>
which may have any shape that is suitable for the making up<br>
that is to be performed. In an embodiment of the invention,<br>
the brush presents an envelope surface in the vicinity of its<br>
proximal end that has a cross-section that decreases going<br>
away from the distal end of the brush. The brush may present<br>
an envelope surface of cross-section that goes through a<br>
maximum between its two longitudinal ends.<br>
The brush may also present an envelope surface of cross-<br>
section that passes through a minimum between its two<br>
longitudinal ends.<br>
The brush may be twisted with a left-hand pitch, as<br>
described in patent application EP 0 611 170, the content of<br>
which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
7<br><br>
A wiper member in accordance with the invention can be<br>
used in a variety of packaging devices.<br>
The wiper member may be made out of at least one of the<br>
materials in the following list: an optionally vulcanized<br>
elastomer, silicone, nitrile rubber, butyl rubber, ethylene<br>
propylene terpolymer rubber (EPDM), thermoplastic elastomer,<br>
styrene isoprene styrene (SIS), SEAS, Hytrel®, Pebax®,<br>
polyethylene (PE), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyamide<br>
(PA), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and polystyrene (PS) .<br>
The wiper member may be mounted on a neck of the<br>
receptacle.<br>
The receptacle may include a neck and the wiper member<br>
may include an assembly skirt suitable for securing the wiper<br>
member in the neck. Where appropriate, the wiper member may<br>
include an annular rim that comes to bear against the top<br>
surface of the neck of the receptacle.<br>
In a variant, the wiper member may, for example, be<br>
overmolded on the receptacle or on a support part, or in a<br>
variant it may be secured to the neck of the receptacle by<br>
clamping between the receptacle and a support part. The wiper<br>
member may, for example, be secured to a ring mounted on the<br>
neck of the receptacle.<br>
The device may include means for providing sealing when<br>
the receptacle is closed. By way of example, sealing may be<br>
provided by the wiper member or by some other part coming to<br>
press against the neck of the receptacle.<br>
The wiper member may be mounted in a device having an<br>
adjustable wiper member, including a moving portion. Such a<br>
configuration can enable the wiper member to be subjected to<br>
greater changes in diameter by a displacement of the moving<br>
portion.<br>
The receptacle may contain a cosmetic, makeup, or a care<br>
product, for example at least one of: a mascara, lipstick,<br>
e.g. a liquid lipstick, lip gloss, foundation, nail varnish,<br>
eye shadow, eye liner, or blush.<br>
The wiper member may comprise flocking on all or part of<br>
its inside surface, and in particular on the wiper lip.<br>
8<br><br>
The substance may be for application to keratinous<br>
fibers, to the eyelashes, and/or to the eyebrows, to<br>
fingernails or toenails, for example, to the skin, to mucous<br>
membranes, to the lips, to the eyelids, or to the cheeks.<br>
The present invention also provides a wiper member as<br>
such.<br>

cross-section views of variant embodiments of devices in<br>

•	Figures 18 to 26 show variant embodiments of the<br>
applicator member.<br>
Figure 1 shows a packaging and applicator device 1<br>
comprising a receptacle 2 filled with a substance P containing<br>
a cosmetic, makeup, or a care product, e.g. a mascara.<br>
The device 1 further comprises an applicator 3, itself<br>
comprising an applicator member 4 at a first end of a stem 5,<br>
9<br><br>
the stem being connected at its second end to a closure cap 6<br>
for closing the receptacle 2, being suitable for screw<br>
fastening thereto. The stem 5 in the example described is of<br>
constant circular section, however the stem of the applicator<br>
could present a different section.<br>
In the example shown in Figure 1, the applicator member 4<br>
is constituted by a brush comprising a metal core twisted to<br>
left or to right, with the bristles being clamped between the<br>
turns of the core. At its proximal end, the brush 4 may<br>
include a chamfer 4a. Naturally, it would not go beyond the<br>
ambit of the present invention for the brush to have a core<br>
that is not twisted or for the applicator to be of some other<br>
kind, as described below.<br>
In the example described, the longitudinal axis of the<br>
applicator member 4 coincides with the longitudinal axis of<br>
the stem 5 and with the axis of the device 1, however the<br>
longitudinal axis of the applicator member 4 could be oriented<br>
in some other way, e.g. substantially perpendicularly to the<br>
longitudinal axis of the stem, e.g. when using a flat stem.<br>
The applicator member 4 could also have a longitudinal axis<br>
that is not rectilinear. The applicator member 4 may have<br>
bristles of different kinds and/or lengths.<br>
The device 1 includes a wiper member 7 shown on its own<br>
in Figures 2 and 3, having a longitudinal axis X and secured<br>
in the neck 8 of the receptacle 2, e.g. by snap-fastening.<br>
For this purpose, the wiper member 7 may include a catch-<br>
forming collar 9 that is arranged to snap beneath the neck 8.<br>
In a variant that is not shown, the collar 9 is replaced by a<br>
shoulder in the outside surface of the wiper member.<br>
The wiper member 7 has an assembly skirt 14 of<br>
longitudinal axis X, terminated by a rim 12 that comes to bear<br>
against the end face 13 of the neck 8 of the receptacle 2, and<br>
that serves advantageously to ensure that the receptacle 2 is<br>
sealed when closed by being compressed by the cap 6 when it is<br>
fully tightened on the neck 8. Naturally, the cap 6 could be<br>
secured onto the receptacle other than by screw fastening, for<br>
example it could be secured by snap-fastening or by friction.<br>
10<br><br>
In a variant, the wiper member may include an annular rim<br>
defining a downwardly open groove in which the top end of the<br>
neck 8 engages.<br>
A wiper lip 17 is connected to the bottom surface of a<br>
bottom portion of the assembly skirt 14 extending beneath the<br>
catch-forming collar 9.<br>
The wiper lip 17 defines internally an orifice 22 through<br>
which the applicator member 4 passes on being taken out of the<br>
receptacle 2.<br>
In the embodiment of Figures 1 to 3, the wiper lip<br>
generally occupies a cone that converges towards the bottom of<br>
the receptacle, the cone having a generator line W at an angle<br>
a relative to the axis X.<br>
In a variant, and as shown in Figure 7, the wiper lip 17<br>
could generally occupy a midplane perpendicular to the<br>
longitudinal axis of the device. In another variant, as shown<br>
in Figure 8, the wiper lip 17 could generally occupy a cone<br>
that converges towards the outlet of the receptacle.<br>
In the example of Figures 1 to 3, the thickness of the<br>
wiper lip tapers towards the radially inner free edge 23<br>
thereof. The thickness of the wiper lip in the vicinity of<br>
its free edge 23 may be about 0.2 mm, for example, while it is<br>
about 0.5 mm where the wiper lip 17 joins the assembly skirt<br>
14.<br>
The tapering of the wiper lip 17 towards its free edge 23<br>
can make it easier to deform while the applicator member is<br>
being inserted into or taken out from the receptacle 2.<br>
In a variant, the thickness of the wiper lip 17 may be<br>
constant, as shown in Figure 9.<br>
The wiper lip 17 presents undulations 20 extending around<br>
the orifice 22.<br>
In the example of Figures 1 to 3, the wiper lip 17<br>
presents undulations 20 that are all identical, in particular<br>
four undulations 20 that are uniformly distributed around the<br>
orifice 22, so that two successive undulations are angularly<br>
spaced apart by 90°, the undulations being substantially<br>
sinusoidal in profile, as shown in the developed view of<br>
Figure 4 .<br>
11<br><br>
The wiper lip 17 could have some other number of<br>
undulations 20, e.g. a number lying in the range three to 12,<br>
or in the range four to ten, or indeed five to nine.<br>
Figures 10 and 11 show a wiper member 7 having a wiper<br>
lip 17 with nine undulations 20 that are uniformly distributed<br>
around the orifice 22.<br>
The undulations may form angular folds, as shown in<br>
Figure 12, or crenellations as shown in Figure 13. The<br>
undulations need not be concentric about the longitudinal axis<br>
of the applicator.<br>
The undulations may be constituted by a repeating<br>
periodic pattern.<br>
It would not go beyond the ambit of the present invention<br>
for the undulations to be distributed irregularly. At least<br>
one undulation could be different from the others, e.g. in<br>
shape or in amplitude.<br>
By way of example, Figure 14 shows an embodiment of a<br>
wiper lip that comprises a mixture of curved undulations and<br>
angular undulations.<br>
The undulations may extend on either side of a midline,<br>
in balanced or in unbalanced manner. In Figure 14A, it can be<br>
seen that the undulations project to one side only of the<br>
wiper lip.<br>
The wiper member may be made in at least one of the<br>
materials in the following list: optionally vulcanized<br>
elastomer, silicone, nitrile rubber, butyl rubber, EPDM,<br>
thermoplastic elastomer, SIS, SEAS, Hytrel®, Pebax®, PE, PET,<br>
PA, PVC, and PS.<br>
The above-described device is used as follows, as shown<br>
in Figures 5 and 6.<br>
While the applicator member 4 is being inserted into the<br>
receptacle 2, as shown in Figure 5, or while it is being taken<br>
out, as shown in Figure 6, the undulations 20 are deployed,<br>
thereby making it easier for the applicator member to pass<br>
through.<br>
The wiper lip 17 may also deform elastically by its<br>
material stretching.<br>
12<br><br>
Figure 15 shows a wiper member 7 having a wiper lip 17<br>
that is overmolded directly onto the neck 8 of the receptacle<br>
2.<br>
The wiper member 7 could also be secured in the neck 8 of<br>
the receptacle 2 not by snap-fastening or by overmolding, but<br>
by any other means, e.g. by adhesive, heat-sealing, or<br>
friction, and it could be made without the catch-forming<br>
collar 9.<br>
By way of example, Figure 16 shows a wiper member 7<br>
having a wiper lip 17 secured to a support part 25, itself<br>
snap-fastened on a portion forming the neck 8 of the<br>
receptacle 2. By way of example, the wiper lip 17 may be<br>
overmolded or stuck onto the support part 25 or it may be held<br>
by friction between the support part 25 and the neck 8. The<br>
support part 25 in the example described is constituted by a<br>
ring snapped onto the neck 8, however it would not go beyond<br>
the ambit of the present invention for the support part 25 to<br>
be secured to the neck 8 by adhesive or by overmolding, for<br>
example.<br>
The support part 25 could be made of a material other<br>
than that of the neck 8, for example the materials used could<br>
present different hardnesses.<br>
In another variant, the device could include means for<br>
deforming the wiper member, e.g. for modifying the dimensions<br>
of the orifice and/or the range of deformation of the wiper<br>
lip as a function of the desired wiping result.<br>
For example, Figure 17 shows a device comprising a first<br>
element 30 and a second element 40 that is capable of turning<br>
relative to the first element 30 about the longitudinal axis X<br>
of the device.<br>
The first element 30 has a generally cylindrical wall 31<br>
of axis X, extended at its top portion by a neck 32 connected<br>
at its bottom end to a transverse wall 33. In the example<br>
shown the first element 30 also presents an internal extension<br>
34 of tubular shape, defining an insertion cone 35 for the<br>
applicator member, that converges towards the inside of the<br>
receptacle, and that is provided at its bottom end with an<br>
annular bead 36.<br>
13<br><br>
In the example described, the second element 40 comprises<br>
a generally tubular body 41 about the axis X, that is closed<br>
at its bottom end by a bottom wall 42. The bottom portion 43<br>
of the body 41 is surrounded by an outer skirt 44. The top<br>
end of the skirt 44 joins the transverse wall 45 which is<br>
connected perpendicularly to the body 41. The wall thereof<br>
becomes thicker above the transverse wall 45 so as to form a<br>
cylindrical guide surface 46 of outside diameter matching the<br>
inside diameter of the bottom end of the wall 31. The height<br>
of the guide surface 46 is sufficient so that regardless of<br>
the angular position of the second element 40 relative to the<br>
first element 30, the surface 46 remains substantially in<br>
contact with the inside surface of the wall 31.<br>
At its top end, on its radially outside surface, the body<br>
41 presents an annular bead 47 that serves for securing the<br>
wiper member 7. The wiper member has an annular rim 12 at its<br>
top end arranged to snap-fasten onto the bead 47. The<br>
assembly skirt 14 extends in the annular space formed between<br>
the inside extension 34 and the top portion of the body 41.<br>
The second element 40 is provided with a stud 50 and the<br>
first element 30 includes a slot 51 passing through the wall<br>
31 having a longitudinal axis Y that extends over a portion of<br>
a helix, for example, over an annular extent of about 120°,<br>
for example, around the axis X. The inclination of the slot<br>
51 makes it possible, for example, to obtain a maximum stroke<br>
d in the axial direction lying in the range 2 mm to 3 mm as<br>
the stud 50 passes from one extreme position to the other, on<br>
the second element 40 turning relative to the first element<br>
30.<br>
When the second element 40 is in its low abutment<br>
position with the stud 50 bearing against the left-hand end of<br>
the slot 51, the bottom end 49 of the inside extension 34<br>
cannot significantly deform the undulations 20 and the wiper<br>
lip 17 of the wiper member 7. Wiping is then at a maximum and<br>
the load of substance carried by the applicator member 4 is at<br>
a minimum.<br>
14<br><br>
When the second element is turned, the stud 50 moves<br>
along the slot 51 and rises relative to the first element 30.<br>
The inside extension 34 presses downwards against the wiper<br>
lip 17 and the undulations 20 are deployed. At the end of the<br>
turning stroke, the stud 50 reaches its high abutment position<br>
corresponding to the left-hand half section in Figure 17.<br>
The person skilled in the art can select the degree of<br>
deformation of the wiper member as a function of the desired<br>
result, e.g. depending on whether or not wiping is to occur<br>
regardless of the position of the stud in the slot, or whether<br>
it is to be possible in a given position to wipe only against<br>
the edge of the inside extension 34.<br>
By way of example, there may be two positions<br>
corresponding respectively to wiping against the deformable<br>
wiper member 7 and to wiping against the inside extension 34.<br>
In a variant, it is also possible to have in at least one<br>
position no wiping at all, with the inside extension 34 being<br>
made in such a manner that it cannot normally wipe the<br>
applicator member.<br>
The wiper member 7 may receive any suitable surface<br>
treatment or coating, e.g. flocking.<br>
The bristles of the brush 4 in the embodiment of Figure 1<br>
extend in the example described all around the core, however<br>
it would not go beyond the ambit of the present invention for<br>
the bristles to occupy a smaller annular sector. The brush<br>
may include at least one concave facet or notch.<br>
Where appropriate, the brush may also have an envelope<br>
surface S of cross-section that is not constant, e.g. passing<br>
through a single maximum as shown in Figure 18, or through a<br>
minimum and a maximum, as shown in Figure 19.<br>
The brush 4 may in particular be of the kind described in<br>
US patent No. 5 876 138, with the minimum section being less<br>
than the smallest section of the orifice of the wiper member,<br>
for example.<br>
Figures 18 and 19 show that the stem 5 may have a<br>
tapering portion 5a at its distal end, e.g. of conical shape.<br>
The presence of such a portion 5a can contribute to further<br>
improving wiping.<br>
15<br><br>
In a variant that is not shown, the stem 5 has a narrow<br>
portion which occupies a position level with the wiper lip 17<br>
when the receptacle is closed and the applicator is in place.<br>
The narrow portion serves to avoid compressing the wiper lip<br>
while at rest, and thus serves to reduce any risk of the wiper<br>
portion becoming permanently deformed.<br>
The invention is not limited to one particular type of<br>
applicator member, and by way of example the applicator member<br>
could be other than a mascara brush, e.g. it could be a comb<br>
as shown in Figure 20, a paint brush as shown in Figure 21, a<br>
pointed felt tip as shown in Figure 22, a foam as shown in<br>
Figure 23, an optionally flocked endpiece extending along an<br>
axis parallel to the longitudinal axis of the stem as shown in<br>
Figure 24, or making an angle relative thereto, as shown in<br>
Figure 25.<br>
The applicator member may have a maximum transverse<br>
dimension that is greater than the diameter of the stem 5.<br>
The cross-section of the applicator member may be<br>
circular or non-circular. By way of example, Figure 26 shows<br>
an applicator member having cross-section that is<br>
substantially square, with elements projecting from its<br>
corners.<br>
Naturally, the characteristics of the various embodiments<br>
described can be combined with one another in variants that<br>
are not shown.<br>
The term "comprising a" should be understood as being<br>
synonymous with "comprising at least one" unless specified to<br>
the contrary.<br>
