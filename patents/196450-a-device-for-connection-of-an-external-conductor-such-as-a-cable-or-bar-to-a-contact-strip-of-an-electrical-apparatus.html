The present invention relates to a device for connecting an external conductor such as a cable or connecting bar to a contact strip of an electrical apparatus such as a moulded case circuit breaker.<br>
This device is of the kind comprising a metal block housed in removable manner in a terminal compartment provided in the rear part of the case of the circuit breaker  an elongated passage designed to receive a terminal strip of the circuit breaker passing through said block, and a pressure screw passing through the upper part of the block in order to perform clamping of the cable against the contact strip.<br>
A terminal for a circuit breaker of the kind referred to above is known, as described in the Patent Application FR 2,622,350 and is used to electrically connect the contact strips of the circuit breaker to electrical distribution cables. However, in this document, the pressure screws present a convex end unsuitable for clamping of flexible copper cables or for clamping of multistory cables. Moreover, this terminal does not allow connection of crimp-on connectors, bars or other accessories, to the contact strips of the circuit breaker.<br>
A connection terminal as described in Patent FR 2,438,334 is also known, whose pressure screw is securedly united to a V-shaped clamping pad designed to achieve correct centring of the cable in the secured position. This terminal does not enable clamping of multicore cables either, nor does it enable connection by means of crimp-on connectors.<br>
The present invention overcomes these shortcomings and proposes a device enabling the contact strips of an electrical apparatus such as a circuit breaker to be electrically connected to different types of external conductors such as cables or multicore cables, bars or crimp-on connectors.<br>
For this purpose, the object of the invention is to achieve a device for connection of an external conductor such as a cable to a contact strip of an electrical apparatus such as a moulded case circuit breaker, this device being characterized in that the above-mentioned pressure screw comprises at its end situated inside the block a<br><br>
securing pad, said pad comprising claws (or recesses) cooperating with recesses (or respectively claws) of complementary shape, provided on the above-mentioned   strip to positively secure the cable between the pad and contact strip when the screw is tightened.<br>
According to a particular embodiment, the above-mentioned securing pad is quadrangular and comprises at each of its corners a claw situated facing a recess of corresponding shape provided on the contact strip.<br>
According to another feature, the device comprises a pair of elongated grooves formed respectively on two internal surfaces of the terminal compartment and designed to receive a butterfly nut.<br>
According to another feature, the above-mentioned grooves are arranged in the bottom part of the compartment.<br>
According to another feature, three facing orifices are provided respectively in the butterfly nut, in the contact strip and in the bottom part of the compartment, said orifices being designed for the passage of a fixing screw, a connector or a bar for fixing onto the above-mentioned contact strip.<br>
According to another feature, a terminal cover plate is fixed onto the rear part of the circuit breaker, said plate comprising, facing each terminal, an opening for passage of the conductor, and the above-mentioned pressure screw is fixedly secured in translation to a protection shield able to come and partially blank off the corresponding opening of the plate when the screw is tightened.<br>
According to another feature, the above-mentioned shield is formed by an L-shaped part, one of the whose wings is mounted freely turning around the bottom part of the screw between the securing pad and the upper part of the block and whose other wing extends towards the upper part of the block.<br>
Advantageously, the securing pad is fixed to one of the ends of the screw shank by crimping.<br><br>
According to another feature, each of the compartments has an associated additional<br>
contact strip designed to be electrically connected to an external device such as a<br>
voltage indicator lamp.<br>
Advantageously, the terminal cover plate is fixed to the rear part of the circuit<br>
breaker by means of rails provided on the Internal surface of the plate cooperating<br>
with grooves of corresponding shape arranged in the rear part of the case of the<br>
apparatus.<br>
These grooves for fixing the plate present a T-shaped transverse section and extend<br>
perpendicularly to the longitudinal direction of the apparatus, in spaces separating<br>
two adjacent compartments.<br>
The object of the invention is also to achieve a switchgear apparatus such as a circuit<br>
breaker comprising on at least one of its large side faces terminal compartments<br>
inside which contact strips extend, this apparatus comprising at least one connection<br>
device comprising the previously described features either alone or in combination.<br>
According  to  a particular  feature,  this  apparatus  comprises  several  of these<br>
connection devices and at least one of the pressure screws with securing pad is<br>
replaced by a screw with a convex end cooperating with a contact strip presenting<br>
the above-mentioned recesses.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a device for connection of an external conductor such as a cable or bar to a contact strip of an electrical apparatus such as moulded case circuit breaker, of the kind comprising a metal block housed in removable manner in a terminal compartment provided in the rear part of the case of the circuit breaker, an elongated passage designed to receive a terminal strip of the circuit breaker passing through said block, and a pressure screw passing through the upper part of the block in order to perform clamping of the cable against the contact strip, characterized in that the above-mentioned pressure screw comprises at its end situated inside the block a securing pad, said pad comprising claws or recesses cooperating with recesses or respectively claws of complementary shape, provided on<br><br>
the above-mentioned contact strip to positively secure the cable between the pad and contact strip when the screw is tightened.<br>
But other advantages and features will become more clearly apparent from the following description which refers to the accompanying drawings given as an example only and in which :<br>
Figure 1 illustrates, in a perspective view comprising a cutaway, the rear part of a<br>
moulded case circuit breaker,<br>
Figure 2 is a perspective view illustrating a terminal according to a particular<br>
embodiment of the connection device of the invention.<br>
Figure 3 is a perspective view illustrating the terminal of the previous figure equipped<br>
with a protection shield according to another feature of the invention.<br>
Figures 4 and 5 are respectively front and cross-sectional views of the terminal of the<br>
previous figure and.<br><br>
Figure 6 is a partial perspective of the rear part of the circuit breaker one of whose contact strips is electrically connected to a connector.<br>
In figure 1, a moulded case circuit breaker D can be seen presenting a four-pole configuration and designed to be used in a residential or industrial application. This case B comprises, on each of its two opposite large faces (only one 1 of which is visible in this figure), four terminal compartments 2, 3, 4, 5. The four compartments provided on the face of the circuit breaker D not represented in this figure respectively house the four power system strips of the circuit breaker, whereas the four compartments 2 to 5 provided on the represented face 1 of the circuit breaker D respectively house the four load strips 6 to 9.<br>
Connection of the load strips 6 to 9 with the external electrical circuits to be protected is most commonly achieved by means of load terminals, in the same way as connection of the mains power system to the cables is achieved by means of power system terminals, said terminals being fitted in the corresponding compartments on the installation site.<br>
Thus it can be seen in figure 1 that the load compartments 2 to 5 are equipped with load terminals 10 to 13. Each load terminal 10 to 13 is formed by a metal block 14 of appreciably parallelepipedic general shape through which there passes an elongated passage 15 inside which one of the contact strips 6 to 9 of the circuit breaker D extends. The shape of each compartment 2 to 5 corresponds appreciably to the external shape of the block 14 so that each block 14 is immobilised vertically after it has been inserted in the compartment 2 to 5. It can also be seen in this figure that each compartment 2 to 5 comprises on the one hand at the level of its two opposite side faces 2a, 2b two additional grooves 16, 17 designed to facilitate removal of the terminal (for example by means of a tool), and on the other hand in its lower part two additional grooves 18, 19 designed to receive a butterfly nut 20 as will be described further on. Each block 14 comprises, in its upper part, a tapped orifice 21 through which a terminal screw 22, 23 is screwed. The terminal screw 22 of the first compartment 2 presents a convex end 22a, whereas the screw 23 of the second compartment 3 is rendered secure preferably by crimping of a securing pad 24.<br><br>
According to a particular embodiment of the invention, and as it can particularly be seen in figures 2 to 5, this quadrangular shaped securing pad 24 is provided, at the level of its four corners, with four claws 25 to 28 directed towards the contact strip 6.<br>
These four claws 25 to 28 are designed to cooperate with four recesses 29 to 32 arranged in the corresponding contact strip 6, said recesses 29 to 32 presenting a complementary shape to that of the claws 25 to 28 and being respectively situated facing the latter.<br>
Thus, these terminals will be suitable for clamping of aluminium cables when they are equipped with a screw 22 with a convex end 22a, and for clamping of copper cables or multicore cables when they are equipped with a securing pad 24 with claws 25 to 28, as previously described.<br>
Referring to figures 4 and 5, it can be seen that the terminal screw 23 equipped with a securing pad 24 is also equipped with an electrical protection shield 33. This shield 33 is formed by an L-shaped part, made of plastic material, one of whose wings 33a is mounted freely turning on the bottom part of the shank of the screw 23 and is interposed between the securing pad 24 and the upper part 34 of the terminal, whereas the other 33b of the two wings 33a, 33b extends in the direction of the upper part of the terminal. This shield 33 is designed to cooperate with an opening of corresponding shape 40 (visible in figure 1) arranged in a terminal cover plate 41 placed on the rear part of the circuit breaker at the end of wiring, in order to achieve an electrical protection in compliance with the standard IP2 in the manner which will be described further on.<br>
Referring more particularly to figure 6, it can be seen that in the lower grooves 18, 19 of one 5 of the compartments 2 to 5 a butterfly nut 20 has been inserted placed under the contact strip 9 and designed to enable fixing of a connector 42 onto said contact strip 9. For this purpose, two orifices 43, 44 have been respectively provided in the contact strip 9 and in the bottom part of the compartment 5, in order to allow the passage of a screw 50 for fixing the connector 42 onto the contact strip 9, screwed into the orifice 20b of the butterfly nut 20 with wings 20a.<br>
In figures 1 to 6, it can be seen that the circuit breaker case is also provided on its two opposite large faces (only one of which can be seen in this figure) with contact<br><br>
sockets 46 designed to supply, by means of fast-on connectors 47, devices such as indicator lamps (not represented) designed to indicate the presence or absence of a voltage.<br>
It should be noted that the grooves 18, 19 enabling fixing of crimp-on connectors 42 can also be used for fixing of copper bars or other connection accessories.<br>
It should be noted that the terminals and screws are advantageously made of aluminium.<br>
It should also be noted that in the circuit breaker represented in figure 1, all the contact strips comprise recesses.<br>
The connection operations of the circuit breaker with the external electrical circuits to be protected will be described briefly hereafter.<br>
On the installation site, terminals as previously described will be inserted in the compartments 2 to 5 whose contact strips 6 to 9 are designed to be connected to cables. When the cables are aluminium cables, the tunnels will preferably be equipped with a screw 22 with a convex end 22a. The recesses 29 to 32 provided in the contact strips 6 to 9 will already enable a better contact quality to be obtained.<br>
When the cables are copper cables, or multicore cables, the screws 23 will be equipped with a securing pad 24 with claws 25 to 28. Clamping of the screw 23 will lead to the claws of the securing pad 24 being inserted in the recesses 29 to 32 of the contact strip 6, the cables thus being held firmly between the securing pad 24 and the contact strip 6, which results in a better contact quality. The clamping operation of the screw 23 will also result in a downwards movement of the shield 33 interposed between the block 14 and plate 41, until this shield 33 blanks off the corresponding opening 40 of the terminal cover plate 41, in such a way as to achieve an electrical insulation from the outside of the terminal, in compliance with the standard IP2. It should be noted that the plate 41 has been previously fixed onto the rear part of the circuit breaker by means of rails 41a provided on the plate 41 cooperating with grooves 41b formed in the case.<br><br>
In order to proceed with connection of a crimp-on connector 42, copper bar or other connection accessory, the butterfly nut 20 with wing 20a simply has to be inserted in the lower grooves 18, 19 and said connector 42 be bolted onto the contact strip 9 by means of a screw 50 passing through four orifices 51, 43, 20b, 44, respectively provided on the connector 42, on the strip 6 (on the nut 20) and in the lower part of the compartment 5.<br>
A device has therefore been achieved by means of the invention enabling connection of the contact strips 6 to 9 to external conductors of different types : copper cable, aluminium cable, multicore cable, spade connector, bar, etc... in a simple and quick manner.<br>
Naturally the invention is in no way limited to the embodiment described and illustrated herein which has been given for example purposes only.<br>
On the contrary, the invention covers all the technical equivalents of the means described and their combinations provided the latter are performed according to the spirit thereof.<br><br><br>
