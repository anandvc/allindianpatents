Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a process for producing a substituted aniline compound which may become a useful intermediate in production of, for example, agricultural chemicals and medicines.<br>
Background Art<br>
It is already known that some of sulfonanilide derivatives having 4,6-dimethoxypyrmidine have a high herbicidal activity (see JP-A-11-60562 and WOO0/06553), It is also known that, in production thereof, a substituted aniline compound is useful as an important intermediate.<br>

The step 1 for producing the substituted indole compound represented by the general formula (3) can allowed to proceed sufficiently even in a solvent-free state but can<br><br>

In the step 2, the reaction is ordinarily conducted using a solvent. The solvent used may be any solvent as long as it does not impair the reaction. - There can be mentioned, for example, acetic acid esters such as methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, butyl acetate and the like; halo-<br><br>

The substituted acetanilide compounds represented by the general formula (4), obtained in the step 2 are novel compounds and are useful as an intermediate for a sulfonani-lide derivative known to be useful as a herbicide.<br>
In this way, the substituted acetanilide compound represented by the general formula (4) can be produced.<br>

fluoroacetanilide.<br>
The substituted acetanilide compound represented by the general formula (4), thus obtained in the step 2 can be used successively in the step 3 without being isolated or purified. That is, the substituted indole compound represented by the general formula (3) is subjected to the oxidation and ring-opening step of the step 2 with, for example, ozone and the like, and successively subjected to the reduction of the step 3 described later, with preferably sodium borohydride in the same vessel; thereby, a 2-(pyrimidine-2-ylhydroxymethyl)acetanilide compound'represented by the general formula (5) can be obtained easily, and the post-treatment of the oxidizing agent used is also easy. Therefore, in view of the easiness of operation, etc., it is preferred industrially to employ a method of conducting such an oxidation and ring-opening step and such a reduction step continuously in the same vessel.<br>
Next, description is made on the step 3.<br><br>
The step 3 is a step for reducing the acetanilide compound represented by the general formula (4) with preferably sodium borohydride to produce a 2- (pyrimidine-2-ylhydroxymethyl)acetanilide compound represented by the general formula (5) . Incidentally, in the general formula (4) , Ri, R2, R3, X and Y have the same definitions as given above.<br>
In the step 3, the molar ratio of the substituted acetanilide compound represented by the general formula (4) and sodium borohydride may be any level, but the amount of sodium borohydride may be 0.5 to 20 moles, preferably 1 to 10 moles per mole of the substituted acetanilide compound.<br>
The reaction of the step 3 is conducted ordinarily using a solvent. The solvent used in the step 3 may be any solvent as long as it does not impair the reaction.

for example, -ISX^ to the reflux temperature of the solvent used, but is preferably -5^C to 60°C.<br>
There is no particular restriction as to the reaction time of the step 3, but it is preferably 0.5 hour to 24 hours.<br>
Incidentally, in the step 3, it is preferred to use sodium borohydride for the stability of the reagent used as well as for a reason that the reagent is used also for the post-treatment of the oxidizing agent used in the step 2 for<br><br>
the oxidative ring-opening of substituted indole compound. However, the reduction in the step 3 is not restricted only to that by sodium borohydride and can also be, for example, a reduction by catalytic hydrogenation {as the catalyst, there can be used palladium carbon [Pd/C], platinum carbon [Pt/C], a Raney catalyst (e.g. Raney nickel), or a metallic catalytic reduction catalyst ordinary used}, a reduction by lithium aluminum hydride or a reduction by diborane.<br>

Incidentally, in' the general formula (5), Ri, R2, R3, X and Y have the same definitions as<br><br>
given above.<br>
This deacetylation is preferably conducted using a base in view of the stability of the intended product.<br>

Of these , preferred are alkali metal hydroxides such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide and the like.<br>
The amount of the base used in the step 4 may be any level as long as it does not decompose the formed substituted aniline compound represented by the general formula (6) However, the amount is ordinarily 0.1 to 30 moles, preferably 0.5 to 10 moles per mole of the 2- (pyrimidine-2-ylhydroxymethyl)acetanilide compound represented by the general formula (5).<br>
The reaction of the step 4 may be conducted using<br><br>
a solvent. The solvent used in the step 4 is not critical as long as it does not impair the reaction. There can be mentioned, for example, aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene, xylene, chlorobenzene and the like; alcohols such as methanol, ethanol and the like; aprotic polar solvents such as dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide and the like; ether type solvents such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane and the like; aliphatic hydrocarbons such as pentane, n-hexane and the like; polyethylene glycols such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) -4 00 and the like; and water.

The reaction temperature of the step 4 can be, for example, -15 °C to the reflux temperature of the solvent used, but is preferably -5°C to 100°C.<br>
The reaction time of the step 4 is not critical<br><br>
but is preferably 0.5 hour to 24 hours.<br>
As described previously, of the reduction and the deacetylation, of the acetanilide compound represented by the general formula (4), any may be conducted first. Therefore, there are described, in the following order, a step (step 5) for deacetylating the acetanilide compound represented by the general formula (4) to produce an amino compound represented by the general formula (7) and a step (step 6) for reducing the amino compound represented by the general formula (7) to produce a final product, i.e. a substituted aniline compound represented by the general formula (6).<br>

The reaction of the step 5 is carried out in the presence of a solvent. The solvent can be exemplified by water and straight chain or branched chain CI to C6 alcohols such as ethanol, methanol and the like. The amount of the solvent may be 1 mole or more per mole of the substituted acetanilide compound represented by the general formula (4) and can be, for example, ordinarily 0.1 to 10 liters, preferably 0.5 to 10 liters per mole of the substituted acetanilide compound represented by the general formula (4) , The amount differs depending upon the kind and amount of the acid used<br><br>
in the step 5, but may be such that the pH of the reaction system becomes approximately 4 or less, preferably 2 or less, more preferably 1 or less.<br>
The reaction of the step 5 may be allowed to proceed sufficiently using the above solvent alone. However, the reaction may also be conducted by further adding other solvent.<br>
The solvent usable by adding in the step 5 may be any solvent as long as it does not impair the solvolysis reaction of the step 5. There can be mentioned, for example, aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene, xylene, chlorobenzene and the like; aprotic polar solvents such as dimethyIforma-mide, dimethylacetamide and the like; ether type solvents such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane and the like; aliphatic hydrocarbons such as pentane, h-hexane and the like; nitriles such as acetonitrile and the like; and polyethylene glycols such as polyethylene glycol (PEG)-400 and the like.

When the reaction of the step 5 is conducted us-<br><br>
ing an alcohol solvent, the alcohol used may react with the carbonyl group of an intended product and an acetal compound may be formed. In such a case, water is added in the presence of an acid or the reaction mixture is poured into water and stirring is made for several minutes to 48 hours, whereby acetal removal is made easily and an intended product can be obtained.<br>
The amount of the solvent may be any level as long as it ensures sufficient stirring of the reaction system, but may be ordinarily 0.5 to 5 liters, preferably 1 to 3 liters per mole of the substituted acetanilide compound represented by the general formula (4).<br>
The reaction temperature of the step 5 can be, for example, 0 °C to the reflux temperature of the solvent used and is preferably 0 to 120 C.<br>
The reaction time of the step 5 is not critical but is preferably 0.5 hour to 24 hours.<br>
The step 6 is a step for reducing the above-obtained amino compound represented by the general formula (7) with preferably sodium borohydride to produce a final<br><br>
product, i.e. a substituted aniline compound represented by the general formula (6). The outline and conditions of this reaction are about the same as in the step 3.<br>
