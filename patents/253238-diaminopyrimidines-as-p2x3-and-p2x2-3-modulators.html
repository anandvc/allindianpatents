This invention pertains to compounds useful for treatment of diseases associated with P2X purinergic receptors, and more particularly to P2X? and/or P2X2/3antagonists usable for treatment of genitourinary, gastrointestinal, respiratory, and pain-related diseases, conditions and disorders.<br>
The urinary bladder is responsible for two important physiological functions: urine storage and urine emptying. This process involves two main steps: (1) the bladder fills progressively until the tension in its walls rises above a threshold level; and (2) a nervous reflex, called the micturition reflex, occurs that empties the bladder or, if this fails, at least causes a conscious desire to urinate. Although the micturition reflex is an autonomic spinal cord reflex, it can also be inhibited or mediated by centers in the cerebral cortex or brain.<br>
Purines, acting via extracellular purinoreceptors, have been implicated as having a variety of physiological and pathological roles. (See, Burnstock (1993) Drug Devt Res. 28:195-206,) ATP, and to a lesser extent, adenosine, can stimulate sensory nerve endings resulting in intense pain and a pronounced increase in sensory nerve discharge. ATP receptors have been classified into two major families, the P2Y- and P2X-purinoreceptors, on the basis of molecular structure, transduction mechanisms, and pharmacological characterization. The P2Y-purinoreceptors are G-protein coupled receptors, while the P2X-purinoreceptors are a family of ATP-gated cation channels. Purinergic receptors, in particular, P2X receptors, are known to form homomultimers or heteromultimers. To date, cDNAs for several P2X receptors subtypes have been cloned, including: six homomeric receptors, P2Xi; P2X2; P2X3; P2X4; P2X5; and P2X7; and three heteromeric receptors P2X2/3, P2X4/6, P2X1/5 (See, e.g., Chen, et al. (1995) Nature 377:428-431; Lewis, et al. (1995) Nature 377:432-435; and Burnstock (1997) Neurophamacol. 36:1127-1139). The structure and chromosomal mapping of mouse genomic P2X3 receptor subunit has also been described (Souslova, et al. (1997) Gene 195:101-111). In vitro, co-expression of P2X2 and P2X3 receptor subunits is necessary to produce ATP-gated currents with the properties seen in some sensory neurons (Lewis, et al. (1995) Nature 377:432-435).<br>
P2X receptor subunits are found on afferents in rodent and human bladder urothelium. Data exists suggesting that ATP may be released from epithelial/endothelial cells of the urinary bladder or other hollow organs as a result of distention (Burnstock (1999) J.<br><br>
Anatomy 194:335-342; and Ferguson et al. (1997) J. Physiol. 505:503-511). ATP released in this manner may serve a role in conveying information to sensory neurons located in subepithelial components, e.g., suburothelial lamina propria (Namasivayam et al. (1999) BJU Intl. 84:854-860). The P2X receptors have been studied in a number of neurons, including sensory, sympathetic, parasympathetic, mesenteric, and central neurons (Zhong, et al (1998) Br. J. Pharmacol. 125:771-781). These studies indicate that purinergic receptors play a role in afferent neurotransmission from the bladder, and that modulators of P2X receptors are potentially useful in the treatment of bladder disorders and other genitourinary diseases or conditions.<br>
Recent evidence also suggests a role of endogenous ATP and purinergic receptors in nociceptive responses in mice (Tsuda et al. (1999) Br. J. Pharmacol. 128:1497-1504). ATP-induced activation of P2X receptors on dorsal root ganglion nerve terminals in the spinal cord has been shown to stimulate release of glutamate, a key neurotransmitter involved in nociceptive signaling (Gu and MacDermott, Nature 389:749-753 (1997)). P2X3 receptors have been identified on nociceptive neurons in the tooth pulp (Cook et al., Nature 387:505-508 (1997)). ATP released from damaged cells may thus lead to pain by activating P2X3 and/or P2X2/3 containing receptors on nociceptive sensory nerve endings, This is consistent with the induction of pain by intradermally applied ATP in the human blister-base model (Bleehen, Br J Pharmacol 62:573-577 (1978)). P2X antagonists have been shown to be analgesic in animal models (Driessen and Starke, Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol 350:618-625 (1994)). This evidence suggests that P2X2 and P2X3 are involved in nociception, and that modulators of P2X receptors are potentially useful as analgesics.<br>
There is accordingly a need for methods of treating diseases, conditions and disorders mediated by P2X3 and/or P2X2/3 receptors, as well as a need for compounds that act as modulators of P2X receptors, including antagonists of P2X3 and P2X2/3 receptors. The present invention satisfies these needs as well as others.<br>
Other researchers have shown that P2X3 receptors are expressed in human colon, and are expressed at higher levels in inflamed colon than in normal colon (Yiangou et al, Neuro-gastroenterol Mot (2001) 13:365-69). Other researchers have implicated the P2X3 receptor in detection of distension or intraluminal pressure in the intestine, and initiation<br><br>
of reflex contractions (Bian et al., J Physiol (2003) 551-1:309-22), and have linked this to colitis (Wynn et al., Am J Physiol Gastrointest Liver Physiol (2004) 287:G647-57),<br>
Inge Brouns et al. {Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol (2000) 23:52-61) found that P2X3 receptors are expressed in pulmonary neuroepithelial bodies (NEBs), implicating the receptor in pain transmission in the lung. More recently, others have implicated P2X2 and P2X3 receptors in p02 detection in pulmonary NEBs (Rong et al., J Neurosci (2003) 23(36):11315-21).<br>

The starting materials and the intermediates of the synthetic reaction schemes can be isolated and purified if desired using conventional techniques, including but not limited to, filtration, distillation, crystallization, chromatography, and the like. Such materials can be characterized using conventional means, including physical constants and spectral data.<br>
Unless specified to the contrary, the reactions described herein preferably are conducted under an inert atmosphere at atmospheric pressure at a reaction temperature range of from about -78°C to about 150°C, more preferably from about 0°C to about 125°C, and most preferably and conveniently at about room (or ambient) temperature, e.g., about 20°C.<br>
Scheme A below illustrates one synthetic procedure usable to prepare specific compounds of formula (I) wherein L is a leaving group and R1, R2, R3 and R4 are as defined herein.<br><br><br><br>
In step 1 of Scheme A, phenol a undergoes an O-alkylation by reaction with an acetonitrile reagent to form cyano ether compound b. Compound b is then treated with Bredrick's reagent (t-butoxybis(dimethylamino)methane) in step 2 to form bisdimethylamino compound c. In step 3 compound c is reacted with aniline to afford the aniline compound d. Compound d then undergoes reaction with guanidine in step 4 to provide phenoxy diamino pyrimidine e. Compound e, in step 5, is subject to iodination to yield iodophenoxy diamino pyrimidine f* In step 6 compound f is treated with acetylene compound g to afford compound h5 which is a compound of formula I in accordance with the invention. Where R4 is H in compound h, a suitable protecting group such as trimethylsilyl may be included on acetylene compound g, which then may be subsequently removed. Alkylation or acylation of the amino groups of compound h to<br>
7	X<br>
provide desired R and R groups. In certain embodiments guanidine hydrochloride may be used in step 3 together with aniline to form phenoxy diamino pyrimidine e directly, without the need for step 4.   In certain embodiments compounds c and/or d need not be isolated as the reaction steps may be carried through in a single reaction vessel.<br>
Scheme B below illustrates another synthetic procedure usable to prepare specific compounds of formula (I) wherein R1, R2, R3, R4, R7 and R8 are as defined herein.<br><br><br><br>
In Step 1 of Scheme B, benzaldehyde i is alkylated with the Grignard reagent derived from 4-chloro-5-iodo-2-methylsulfanyl-pyrimidine j or like iodopyrimidine to provide an alpha-hydroxy benzyl pyrimidine k. The iodopyrimidine used in this step may be prepared according to the procedure described by Sakamoto et al., Chem. Pharm. Bull., 34 1986, 2719, Numerous substituted benzaldehydes a are commercially available or are readily prepared by techniques well known to those skilled in the art. In many instances, a "masked aldehyde", such as an imine or oxazoline, may be used used to allow introduction of desired functionalities to benzaldehyde i, after which the masked aldehyde is deprotected to provide the free aldehyde group.<br>
In step 2, alpha-hydroxy benzyl pyrimidine k is oxidized to provide ketone compound 1. In step 3, a first amination by reaction of amine m with ketone compound 1 yields amino-pyrimidine phenone compound n. In step 4 the carbonyl group of compound n is reduced to a methylene group to provide benzyl aminopyridine compound o. In step 5, an oxidation of the methylsulfanyl group of benzyl aminopyrimidine o is carried out to afford amino methanesulfonyl benzylpyrimidine g&gt; A second amination occurs in step 6 in which amino methanesulfonyl benzylpyrimidine j&gt; is treated with amine fl to displace the methanesulfonyl group and provide diamino benzylpyrimidine r. The diamino benzylpyrimidine r is then subject to iodination in step 7 followed y acetylation in step 8 by reaction with acetylene g, to afford diaminopyrimidine t, which is a compound of formula I in accordance with the invention.<br><br>
Numerous variations on the above procedure are possible and will suggest themselves to those skilled in the art upon review of this disclosure. Specific details for producing compounds of the invention are described in the Examples section below.<br>

Example 1:     5-(5-Ethynyl-2-isopropyl-4-methoxy-phenoxy)-pyrimidine-2,4-diamine<br>
The synthetic procedure used in this Example is outlined in Scheme C.<br><br>
Step 1 2-IsopropyI-4-methoxv-phenol<br>
To a cooled solution of l-(2-Hydroxy-5-methoxy-phenyl)-ethanone (10.0 g) in 80 mL of THF was gradually added 46.4 g of 3M solution of MeMgCl in THF at a rate such that the reaction mixture temperature did not exceed 25 °C. Following addition of the MeMgCl solution, the reaction mixture was stirred at RT for 18 hours. To the stirred solution was then added 10% palladium on carbon (1.02 g, 50% water wet) suspended in 4 mL of THF. The reaction mixture was placed under a hydrogen atmosphere at 5 psig and cooling was applied to maintain a temperature of approximately 25 °C. To the cooled mixture was gradually added concentrated HC1 (20 mL) while maintaining the reaction temperature at 25°C. The resultant mixture was stirred at RT for 18 hours, then treated with 45 mL water and filtered through a bed of Celite to remove suspended catalyst. The filter cake was rinsed with EtOAc and the combined filtrate was separated. The organic<br><br>
phase was washed with water, then concentrated under reduced pressure to give 10.4 g of 2-isopropyl-4-methoxy-phenol, MS (M+H) = 167, This product was dissolved in 2-butanone (20.4 g) and the crude solution was employed directly in the next step.<br>
Step 2   (2-Isopropvl-4-methoxV"phenoxvVacetonitrile<br>
A stirred slurry of toluene-4-sulfonic acid cyanomethyl ester (13.0 g), potassium carbonate (13,0 g) and 2-isopropyl-4-methoxyphenol (9.57 g) in 85 mL of 2-butanone was heated to 55-60°C for 4 days, then heated to relux for 18 hours. The resultant slurry was cooled and filtered to remove solids. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure and the residue was redissolved in toluene. The toluene solution was extracted with IN KOH, and the organic phase was concentrated under reduced pressure to give 20,6 g of a 1:1 (by weight) solution of (2-isopropyl-4-methoxy-phenoxy)-acetonitrile in toluene, which was used directly in the next step. An aliquot (0.967 g) of this solution was concentrated to dryness to give 0.509 g of crude (2-isopropyl-4-methoxy-phenoxy)-acetonitrile, MS (M+H) = 206.<br>
Step 3    5-(2-Isopropvl-4-methoxy'phenoxv)-pvrimidine-Z4-diamine A 1:1 (by weight) solution of toluene and (2-isopropyl-4-methoxy-phenoxy)-acetonitrile (10.6 g of the nitrile compound) was concentrated under reduced pressure and the residue was treated with 10,8 g of tert-butoxybis(dimethylamino)methane (Bredrick's Reagent). The resulting mixture was dissolved in 22 mL of DMF and the solution was heated to 110°C for 2 hours. The DMF solution was cooled and transferred onto 14.7 g of aniline hydrochloride. The resulting mixture was heated to 120°C for 22 hours, then cooled, diluted with 25 mL toluene, then with 70 mL of water. The organic layer was separated, washed with water, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was transferred into 25 mL DMF, and the DMF solution was transferred onto 6.01 g of guanidine carbonate. The resulting mixture was heated to 120°C for 3 days, then cooled, diluted with 10 mL of EtOAc, then reheated to 60°C. Water (75.1m L) was added and the resultant mixture was allowed to cool to RT. The precipitated solid was collected by filtration, rinsed with isopropanol and dried under vacuum at 50°C to give 9.62 g of 5-(2-isopropyl-4-methoxy-phenoxy)-pyrimidine-2,4-diamine, m.p. 170-171°C, MS (M+H) = 275.<br><br>
Step 4    5-r5-Iodo-2-isopropvl-4-methoxv-phenoxvVpvrimidine-2,4-diamine To a solution of 5-(2-isopropyl-4-methoxy-phenoxy)-pyrimidine-2,4-diamine (6.50 g) in mL glacial acetic acid was added a solution of 9.205 g ICl (iodine monochloride) in 8 mL of acetic acid, with addition carried out at a rate such that the temperature of the resulting mixture did not exceed 24°C. Water (1L0 mL) was added and the resultant mixture was stirred at 25°C for 42 hours. Excess ICl was decomposed by the addition of aqueous solution of sodium bisulfite (3,5 mL) at a rate such that the temperature of the reaction mixture did not exceed 20°C. Water (40 mL) was added, and the precipitate was collected by filtration and air-dried to give 8.86 g of crude 5-(5-iodo-2-isopropyl-4-methoxy-phenoxy)-pyrimidine-2,4-diamine. A suspension of the crude product in 90 mL water was made basic by addition of 50% NaOH, and the resulting solution was extracted into warm EtOAc. The combined organic layers were filtered and EtOAc was replaced by isopropanol via distillation. To the hot isopropanol solution was added 3.4 mL of 6N HC1 and the resultant mixture was cooled slowly to 15°C. Crystals of the resulting HCI salt were isolated by filtration, rinsed with isopropanol, and dried under vacuum at 70°C to give 6.08 g (58.8%) of 5-(5-iodo-2-isopropyl-4-methoxy-phenoxy)-pyrimidine-2,4-diamine hydrochloride salt, m,p. = 262.0-263.0 °C, MS (M+H) = 401.<br>
Step 5     5-(2-Isopropvl-4-methoxv-5-trimethvlsilanylethynvl-phenoxvVpvrimidine-2.4-diamine<br>
5-(5-Iodo-2-isopropyl-4-methoxy-phenoxy)-pyrimidine-2,4-diamine (2.0 g, 5 mmol), bis(triphenylphosphine)-Palladium dichloride (700 mg, 1 mmol) and Cul (100 mg, 0.5 mmol) were added to 14 mL dry THF under nitrogen. Trimethylsilyl acetylene (1.4 mL, 10 mmol) was added, followed by 7 mL diisopropylethylamine. The reaction mixture was stirred at 50°C under nitrogen for 17 hours, then was allowed to cool for two hours with stirring. The reaction mixture was poured into 15 % aqueous NH4CI and extracted into EtOAc.

To a solution of 5-iodo-2-isopropyl-l,3-dimethoxy-benzene (805 mg, 2.63 mmol) in anhydrous DCM (26 mL) at 0°C was added boron tribromide (2.63 mL, 2.63 mmol) 1M in DCM), maintaining the temperature of the reaction at 0°C during the addition. After stirring at RT for 18 hours, water (10 mL) was slowly added to the reaction. After stirring 30 min, the DCM layer was collected, dried using anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. Purification of the residue by silica gel column chromatography eluting with 90/10 hexane/ ethyl acetate yielded 5-iodo-2-isopropyl-3-methoxy-phenol (612 mg, 80%) as an oil, MS (M+H) = 293,<br>
Step 9    5-(5-lodO"2-isopropvl-3-methoxv-phenoxvVpyrimidine-2.4-diamine Following the procedure of Steps 2-4 of Example 6, 5~Iodo-2-isopropyl-3~methoxy-phenol was converted to 5-(5-Iodo-2-isopropyl-3-methoxy-phenoxy)-pyrimidine-2,4-diamine,MS(M+H) = 401.<br>
Example 10:  Formulations<br>
Pharmaceutical preparations for delivery by various routes are formulated as shown in the following Tables. "Active ingredient" or "Active compound" as used in the Tables means one or more of the Compounds of Formula 1.<br>
Composition for Oral Administration<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Several aqueous suspensions containing from about 0.025-0.5 percent active compound are prepared as nasal spray formulations. The formulations optionally contain inactive ingredients such as, for example, microcrystalline cellulose, sodium carboxymethyl-cellulose, dextrose, and the like. Hydrochloric acid may be added to adjust pH, The nasal spray formulations may be delivered via a nasal spray metered pump typically delivering about 50-100 microliters of formulation per actuation, A typical dosing schedule is 2-4 sprays every 4-12 hours.<br>
Example 11:   P2X3/P2X2/3 FLIPR (Fluorometric Imaging Plate Reader) Assay<br><br>
CH0-K1 cells were transfected with cloned rat P2X3 or human P2X2/3 receptor subunits and passaged in flasks, 18-24 hours before the FLIPR experiment, cells were released from their flasks, centrifuged, and resuspended in nutrient medium at 2.5 x 105 cells/ml The cells were aliquoted into black-walled 96-well plates at a density of 50,000 cells/well and incubated overnight in 5% CO2 at 37°C. On the day of the experiment, cells were washed in FLIPR buffer (calcium- and magnesium-free Hank's balanced salt solution, 10 mM HEPES, 2 mM CaC^, 2.5 mM probenecid; FB). Each well received 100 pi FB and 100 ^1 of the fluorescent dye Fluo-3 AM [2 ^xM final cone.]. After a 1 hour dye loading incubation at 37°C, the cells were washed 4 times with FB, and a final 75 fil/well FB was left in each well.<br>
Test compounds (dissolved in DMSO at 10 mM and serially diluted with FB) or vehicle were added to each well (25 ul of a 4X solution) and allowed to equilibrate for 20 min at RT. The plates were then placed in the FLIPR and a baseline fluorescence measurement (excitation at 488 nm and emission at 510-570 nm) was obtained for 10 seconds before a 100 |xl/well agonist or vehicle addition. The agonist was a 2X solution of a,p-meATP producing a final concentration of 1 uM (P2X3) or 5 |xM (P2X2/3). Fluorescence was measured for an additional 2 min at 1 second intervals after agonist addition. A final addition of ionomycin (5 uM, final concentration) was made to each well of the FLIPR test plate to establish cell viability and maximum fluorescence of dye-bound cytosolic calcium. Peak fluorescence in response to the addition of a,P-meATP (in the absence and presence of test compounds) was measured and inhibition curves generated using nonlinear regression. PPADS, a standard P2X antagonist, was used as a positive control. Using the above procedure, compounds of the invention exhibited activity for the P2X3 and P2X2/3 receptor. The compound 4-(2,4-Diamino-pyrimidin-5-yloxy)-2-ethynyl-5-isopropyl-phenol, e.g., exhibited a pIC.50 of approximately 8.24 for the P2X3 receptor, and approximately 7.99 for the P2X2/3 receptor, using the above assay.<br>
Example 12:  In vivo Assay for Asthma and Lung Function<br>
BALb/cJ mice are immunized with a standard immunization protocol. Briefly, mice (N=8/group) are immunized i.p. with ovalbumin (OVA; 10 ug) in alum on days 0 and 14. Mice are then challenged with aerosolized OVA (5%) on day 21 and 22. Animals receive vehicle (p.o.) or a compound of the invention (100 mg/kg p.o.) all starting on day 20.<br><br>
Lung function is evaluated on day 23 using the Buxco system to measure PenH in response to an aerosol methacholine challenge. Mice are then euthanized and plasma samples collected at the end of the study*<br>
Example 13:  Volume Induced Bladder Contraction Assay<br>
Female Sprague-Dawley rats (200-300g) were anesthetized with urethane (1.5 g/kg, sc). The animals were tracheotomized, and a carotid artery and femoral vein were cannulated for blood pressure measurement and drug administration, respectively. A laparotomy was performed and the ureters were ligated and transected proximal to the ligation. The external urethral meatus was ligated with silk suture and the urinary bladder was cannulated via the dome for saline infusion and bladder pressure measurement. Following a 15-30 minute stabilization period the bladder was infused with RT saline at 100 |il/min until continuous volume-induced bladder contractions (VIBCs) were observed. The infusion rate was then lowered to 3-5 jjj/min for 30 min before the bladder was drained and allowed to rest for 30 min. All subsequent infusions were performed as indicated except the lower infusion rate was maintained for only 15 min instead of 30 min. Bladder filling and draining cycles were repeated until the threshold volumes (TV; the volume needed to trigger the first micturition bladder contraction) varied by less than 10% for two consecutive baselines and contraction frequency was within 2 contractions for a 10 minute period following the slower infusion rate. Once reproducible TVs and VIBCs were established the bladder was drained and the animal was dosed with drug or vehicle (0.5 ml/kg, i.v.) 3 min prior to the start of the next scheduled infusion.<br>
Example 14: Formalin Pain Assay<br>
Male Sprague Dawley rats (180-220 g) are placed in individual Plexiglas cylinders and allowed to acclimate to the testing environment for 30 min* Vehicle, drug or positive control (morphine 2 mg/kg) is administered subcutaneously at 5 ml/kg. 15 min post dosing, formalin (5% in 50 /u\) is injected into plantar surface of the right hind paw using a 26-gauge needle. Rats are immediately put back to the observation chamber. Mirrors placed around the chamber allow unhindered observation of the formalin-injected paw. The duration of nociphensive behavior of each animal is recorded by a blinded observer using an automated behavioral timer. Hindpaw licking and shaking / lifting are recorded separately in 5 min bin, for a total of 60 min. The sum of time spent licking or shaking in<br><br>
seconds from time 0 to 5 min is considered the early phase, whereas the late phase is taken as the sum of seconds spent licking or shaking from 15 to 40 min. A plasma sample is collected.<br>
Example 15:   Colon Pain Assay<br>
Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (350-425 g; Harlan, Indianapolis, IN) are housed 1-2 per cage in an animal care facility. Rats are deeply anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (45 mg/kg) administered intraperitoneally. Electrodes are placed and secured into the external oblique musculature for electromyographic (EMG) recording. Electrode leads are tunneled subcutaneously and exteriorized at the nape of the neck for future access. After surgery, rats are housed separately and allowed to recuperate for 4-5 days prior to testing.<br>
The descending colon and rectum are distended by pressure-controlled inflation of a 7-8 cm-long flexible latex balloon tied around a flexible tube. The balloon is lubricated, inserted into the colon via the anus, and anchored by taping the balloon catheter to the base of the tail. Colorectal distension (CRD) is achieved by opening a solenoid gate to a constant pressure air reservoir. Intracolonic pressure is controlled and continuously monitored by a pressure control device. Response is quantified as the visceromotor response (VMR), a contraction of the abdominal and hindlimb musculature. EMG activity produced by contraction of the external oblique musculature is quantified using Spike2 software (Cambridge Electronic Design). Each distension trial lasts 60 sec, and EMG activity is quantified for 20 sec before distension (baseline), during 20 sec distension, and 20 sec after distention. The increase in total number of recorded counts during distension above baseline is defined as the response. Stable baseline responses to CRD (10, 20, 40 and 80 mmHg, 20 seconds, 4 min apart) are obtained in conscious, unsedated rats before any treatment.<br>
Compounds are evaluated for effects on responses to colon distension initially in a model of acute visceral nociception and a model of colon hypersensitivity produced by intracolonic treatment with zymosan (1 mL, 25 mg/mL) instilled into the colon with a gavage needle inserted to a depth of about 6 cm* Experimental groups will consist of 8 rats each. Acute visceral nociception: For testing effects of drug on acute visceral nociception, 1 of 3 doses of drug, vehicle or positive control (morphine, 2.5 mg/kg) are administered after<br><br>
baseline responses are established; responses to distension are followed over the next 60-90 min.<br>
Visceral hypersensitivity: For testing effects of drug or vehicle after intracolonic treatment with zymosan, intracolonic treatment is given after baseline responses are established. Prior to drug testing at 4 hours, responses to distension are assessed to establish the presence of hypersensitivity* In zymosan-treated rats, administration of 1 of<br>
3	doses of drug, vehicle or positive control (morphine, 2.5 mg/kg) are given 4 hours after<br>
zymosan treatment and responses to distension followed over the next 60-90 min.<br>
Example 16:  Cold allodynia in Rats with a Chronic Constriction Injury of the Sciatic Nerve<br>
The effects of compounds of this invention on cold allodynia are determined using the chronic constriction injury (CCI) model of neuropathic pain in rats, where cold allodynia is measured in a cold-water bath with a metal-plate floor and water at a depth of 1.5-2.0 cm and a temperature of 3-4°C (Gogas et al., Analgesia, 1997, 3, 1-8), Specifically, CCI, rats are anesthetized; the trifurcation of the sciatic nerve is located and<br>
4	ligatures (4-0, or 5-0 chromic gut) are placed circumferentially around the sciatic nerve<br>
proximal to the trifurcation. The rats are then allowed to recover from the surgery. On<br>
days 4-7 after surgery, the rats are initially assessed for cold -induced allodynia by<br>
individually placing the animals in the cold-water bath and recording the total lifts of the<br>
injured paw during a 1-min period of time: The injured paw is lifted out of the water.<br>
Paw lifts associated with locomotion or body repositioning are not recorded. Rats that<br>
displayed 5 lifts per min or more on day 4-7 following surgery are considered to exhibit<br>
cold allodynia and are used in subsequent studies. In the acute studies, vehicle, reference<br>
compound or compounds of this invention are administered subcutaneously (s,c.) 30 min<br>
before testing. The effects of repeated administration of the compounds of this invention<br>
on cold allodynia are determined 14, 20 or 38 h following the last oral dose of the<br>
following regimen: oral (p.o.) administration of vehicle, reference or a compound of this<br>
invention at -12 h intervals (BID) for 7 days.<br>
Example 17:  Cancer Bone Pain in C3H/HeJ Mice<br><br>
The effects of compounds of this invention on bone pain are determined between Day 7 to Day 18 following intramedullary injection of 2472 sarcoma cells into the distal femur of C3H/HeJ mice.<br>
Specifically, NCTC 2472 tumor cells (American Type Culture Collection, ATCC), previously shown to form lytic lesions in bone after intramedullary injection, are grown and maintained according to ATCC recommendations. Approximately 10 cells are injected directly into the medullary cavity of the distal femur in anesthetized C3H/HeJ mice. Beginning on about Day 7, the mice are assessed for spontaneous nocifensive behaviors (flinching &amp; guarding), palpation-evoked nocifensive behaviors (flinching &amp; guarding), forced ambultory guarding and limb use. The effects of compounds of this invention are determined following a single acute (s.c.) administration on Day 7 - Day 15. In addition, the effects of repeated (BID) administration of compounds of this invention from Day 7 - Day 15 are determined within 1 hour of the first dose on Days 7, 9, 11,13 and 15.<br>
