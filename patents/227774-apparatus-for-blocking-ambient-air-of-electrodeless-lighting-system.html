				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an electrodeless lighting system using<br>
microwave, and particularly, to an apparatus for blocking ambient air of an<br>
electrodeless lighting system for preventing ambient air from flowing into an area<br>
where a bulb and a mesh screen are installed.<br>
2.	Description of the Background Art<br>
Generally, an electrodeless lighting system is an apparatus for emitting<br>
visible rays or ultraviolet rays by radiating microwave to an electrodeless plasma<br>
bulb, and it has longer life span that that of incandescent lamp or fluorescent lamp<br>
and has superior lighting effect.<br>
Figure 1 is a longitudinal cross-sectional view showing an electrodeless<br>
lighting system according to the conventional art.<br>
The conventional electrodeless lighting system comprises: a magnetron 2<br>
installed in a case 1 for generating microwave; a high voltage generator 3 for<br>
providing the magnetron 2 with high voltage after rising utility AC power source to<br>
the high voltage; a waveguide 4 for transmitting the microwave generated in the<br>
magnetron 2; a mesh screen 6 installed on an outlet portion of the waveguide for<br>
blocking a leakage of the microwave and for passing light; and a bulb 5, in which<br>
filled material becomes plasma by the microwave transmitted through the<br><br>
waveguide 4 to emit the light, located in the mesh screen 6.<br>
In the electrodeless lighting system like above, a reflector 7 for reflecting<br>
forward the light generated in the bulb 5 is disposed around the mesh screen 6 in<br>
front of the case 1, and a mirror 3 for passing the microwave transmitted through<br>
the waveguide 4 and reflecting the light radiated from the bulb 5 is installed in an<br>
outlet portion 4a of the waveguide 4.<br>
On the other hand, a fan housing 9a, a cooling fan 9b, and a fan motor 9c<br>
are installed on rear side of the case 1 for cooling down the magnetron 2 and the<br>
high voltage generator 3 as air cooling method.<br>
In addition, a bulb motor 5b is installed on bottom surface of the<br>
waveguide 4 so as to rotate and cool down the bulb 5, and a bulb shaft 5a which is<br>
connected as penetrating the waveguide 4 is installed between the bulb motor 5b<br>
and the bulb 5.<br>
And holes 4b and 8a are formed on the waveguide 4 and on the mirror 8<br>
so as to pass the bulb shaft 5a.<br>
In the electrodeless lighting system constructed above, when an electric<br>
source is applied to the high voltage generator 3, the high voltage generator 3<br>
rises the utility AC power to high voltage and provides the magnetron 2 with the<br>
high voltage. And the magnetron 2 generates the microwave having ultra high<br>
frequency.<br>
The generated microwave is radiated into the mesh screen 6 through the<br>
waveguide 4, and discharges the material filled in the bulb 5 to emit the light<br>
having its own emission spectrum. In addition, the light generated in the bulb 5 is<br>
reflected on the mirror 8 and the reflector 7 toward front side to illuminate a lighting<br>
area.<br><br>
On the other hand, when the electrodeless lighting system is operated, the<br>
magnetron 2 and the high voltage generator 3 generate heat of high temperature.<br>
Therefore, the fan motor 9c and the cooling fan 9b are operated to cool down<br>
inside of the case 1 as the air cooling method.<br>
That is, when the cooling fan 9b is operated, the air which is flowed into<br>
the case 1 through the fan housing 9a cools down the magnetron 2 and the high<br>
voltage generator 3 and then goes out through a discharge hole 1a.<br>
However, the ambient air flowed into the case 1 as the cooling fan 9b is<br>
operated is also flowed in the light emitting area in which the bulb 5 and the mesh<br>
screen 6 are located through the hole 4b formed on a center part of the waveguide<br>
4 and the hole 8a of the mirror 8.<br>
In addition, impurities such as dust are also flowed with the ambient air<br>
when the air is flowed into the light emitting area where the bulb 5 and the mesh<br>
screen 6 are located, and the flowed ambient air and the impurities oxidizes the<br>
mesh screen 6 which is made using a metal. And therefore, the life span of the<br>
mesh screen 6 is reduced.<br>
That is, the light emitting area in which the mesh screen 6 is located is<br>
considerably high temperature environment because the bulb 5 generates high<br>
temperature over 1000Â°C, and at that time, the ambient air and the impurities<br>
flowed into the light emitting area contact to the mesh screen 6 of metal, and<br>
therefore, the oxidation rate is greatly increased.<br>
Therefore, if the mesh screen is oxidized and burned, the microwave may<br>
be leaked. Therefore, the stability of the lighting apparatus is decreased, and the<br>
maintenance cost of the lighting apparatus is very high because the mesh screen<br>
6 should be replaced frequently.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus for<br>
blocking ambient air of an electrodeless lighting system which is able to prevent<br>
ambient air from being flowed into a light emitting area and to prevent the mesh<br>
screen from being damaged by sealing the light emitting area where the mesh<br>
screen is located so that the ambient air can not be flowed into the light emitting<br>
area.<br>
Also, another object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus for<br>

view showing "A" part of Figure 2, Figure 4 is a detailed view showing a<br>
disintegrated state of "B" part of Figure 2, and Figure 5 is a bottom view showing a<br>
waveguide shown in Figure 2.<br>
As shown in Figure 2, a magnetron 20 for generating microwave and a<br>
high voltage generator 30 for raising utility AC power to high voltage and providing<br>
the high voltage are disposed in a case 10.<br>
A waveguide 40 for transmitting microwave generated in the magnetron<br><br>
20 is located between the magnetron 20 and the high voltage generator 30.<br>
Herein, the waveguide 40 is fixed in the case 10 via a fixing bracket 45 in<br>
the state of being fixed on the fixing bracket 45, and an outlet portion 41 through<br>
which the microwave is discharged is located as protruded toward the front side of<br>
the case 10.<br>
A mesh screen 60 for blocking a leakage of the microwave and passing<br>
the light is connected to the outlet portion of the waveguide 40, and a bulb 50, in<br>
which the filled material becomes plasma by the microwave energy transmitted<br>
through the waveguide 40 to emit the light, is installed in the mesh screen 60.<br>
Herein, a mirror 65 for passing the microwave transmitted through the<br>
waveguide 40 and reflecting the light radiated from the bulb 50 toward the front<br>
direction is installed inside the outlet portion 41 of the waveguide.<br>
A reflector 70 for reflecting the light generated in the bulb 50 toward the<br>
front direction intensively is installed on the front side of the case 10, and a cover<br>
glass 75 is disposed on front side of the reflector 75 so as to seal the inside and at<br>
the same time, to permeate the light toward the front direction.<br>
A fan housing 81, a cooling fan 83, and a fan motor 85 are installed on<br>
rear side of the case 10 so as to cool down the magnetron 20 and the high voltage<br>
generator 30 using air cooling method, and a discharge hole 15 is formed on a<br>
front surface of the case 10 so as to discharge the air which was flowed in the<br>
case 10.<br>
A bulb motor 53 is installed on a bottom surface of the waveguide 40 so<br>
as to cool down the bulb 50 as rotating the bulb, and the bulb motor 53 and the<br>
bulb 50 are mutually connected through a bulb shaft 55 which passes through a<br>
center part of the waveguide 40.<br><br>
A shaft hole 42 is formed on the waveguide 40 so that the bulb shaft 55<br>
cam be passed therethrough.<br>
The above electrodeless lighting system is constructed so that the<br>
ambient air is flowed into the case 10 to cool down the magnetron 20, etc.<br>
Therefore, gasket members for blocking the inflow path of the ambient air are<br>
installed so that the light emitting area where the mesh screen 60 and the bulb 50<br>
are located can be sealed completely from the outer side.<br>
That is, the ambient air may be flowed into the area where the mesh<br>
screen 60 is located through a gap between the cover glass 75 and the reflector<br>
70, a gap between the reflector 70 and the case 10, a gap between the case 10<br>
and the bracket 45, a gap between the bracket 45 and the waveguide 40, and the<br>
shaft hole 42 through which the bulb shaft 55 is penetrated.<br>
Therefore, a glass gasket 91 seals the part where the cover glass 75 and<br>
the reflector 70 is coupled.<br>
In addition, as shown in Figure 3, a reflector gasket 92, a first bracket<br>
gasket 93, and a second bracket gasket 94 are inserted into between the reflector<br>
70 and front surface of the case 10, between an inner side surface of the case 10<br>
and the fixing bracket 45, and between the fixing bracket 45 and the waveguide 40<br>
respectively, and the inflow paths of the ambient air are blocked.<br>
Herein, it is desirable that gasket recesses 70a, 45a, and 45b are formed<br>
on the reflector 70 and the bracket 45 so that the gaskets 92, 93, and 94 are<br>
inserted. Surely, the gasket recesses may be formed on the case 10 or the<br>
waveguide 40.<br>
In addition, as shown in Figures 4 and 5, a hole forming pipe 43, which is<br>
extended from the front side of the waveguide 40 toward the direction of the bulb<br><br>
motor 53 for forming the shaft hole 42, is formed in order to seal the shaft hole 42<br>
part of the waveguide 40 through which the bulb shaft 55 is penetrated.<br>
A hole gasket 95 of o-ring shape is inserted between the hole forming pipe<br>
43 and the bulb motor 53.<br>
The hole forming pipe 43 includes a gasket recess 43a so that the hole<br>
gasket 95 can be mounted, and a supporting rib 44 of "+" structure is connected<br>
between the hole forming pipe and the main body of the waveguide 40 so as to<br>
support the hole forming pipe 43.<br>
In addition, the bulb motor 53 includes a boss portion 53a, which is<br>
protruded than other parts of the motor, on a part where the shaft is protruded, and<br>
the hole gasket 95 is mounted between the boss portion 53a and the hole forming<br>
pipe 43.<br>
On the other hand, the bulb motor 53 is mounted to a plurality of bosses<br>
45 protruded on a bottom surface of the waveguide 40 as assembled using a<br>
screw 46.<br>
Operation of the apparatus for blocking ambient air of the electrodeless<br>
lighting system according to the first embodiment of the present invention will be<br>
described as follows.<br>
When the electrodeless lighting system is operated, the fan motor 85 and<br>
the cooling fan 83 are operated to make ambient air flow into the case 10, as<br>
shown in Figure 2. The flowed air cools down the magnetron 20, and the high<br>
voltage generator 30, and then, goes out through the discharge hole 15 on the<br>
case 10.<br>
Herein, the hole gasket 95, the first and second bracket gaskets 93 and 94<br>
are installed on the shaft hole 42 part of the waveguide 40, between the<br><br>
waveguide 40 and the bracket 45, and between the bracket 45 and the case 10<br>
respectively, and therefore, the ambient air can not be flowed into the light emitting<br>
area where the bulb 50 and the mesh screen 60 are located.<br>
Also, the reflector gasket 92 and the glass gasket 91 are installed between<br>
the case 10 and the reflector 71, and between the reflector 70 and the cover glass<br>
75, and therefore, the ambient air is not flowed in the reflector 70.<br>
Therefore, the light emitting area, in which the mesh screen 60 and the<br>
bulb 50, surrounded by the cover glass 75, the reflector 70, the case 10, and the<br>
waveguide 40 is sealed completely from the outer side, and thereby the<br>
oxidization of the mesh screen 60 by being contacted to the outer air can be<br>
minimized and the damage of the mesh screen 60 can be prevented.<br>
Also, the path to the inside of the light emitting area in the reflector 70 is<br>
completely blocked, and therefore, impurities such as dust which can be flowed<br>
with the outer air are not flowed into the light emitting area, and a clean emitting<br>
environment can be made.<br>
Figure 6 is a longitudinal cross-sectional view showing an electrodeless<br>
lighting system according to the second embodiment of the present invention, and<br>
Figure 7 is a detailed view showing "C" part in Figure 6. Herein, same reference<br>
numerals are used for same parts as those of the first embodiment, and<br>
descriptions for those are omitted.<br>
In the electrodeless lighting system according to the first embodiment of<br>
the present invention, the reflector is used for reflecting the light toward the front<br>
direction. However, in the electrodeless lighting system according to the second<br>
embodiment of the present invention, a globe 100 of spherical shape is installed<br><br>
so that the light generated in the bulb 50 can be reflected to all directions.<br>
Herein, it is desirable that the globe 100 is made using an irregularly<br>
reflecting material in order to minimize glaring phenomenon that a user may feel,<br>
and only one surface is opened and fixed on the front surface of the case 10.<br>
Referring to Figure 7, the globe 100 includes a fixed portion 101 extended<br>
as a cylinder on the opened part, and a positive screw 102 is formed on an outer<br>
circumferential surface of the fixed portion 101. In addition, a fixing ring 110 in<br>
which a negative screw 112 is formed on an inner circumferential surface is<br>
installed on the case 10.<br>
Therefore, the globe 100 is fixed on the fixing ring 110 as screw<br>
assembling method and installed on front side of the case 10.<br>
At that time, a globe gasket 120 is inserted between the fixed portion 110<br>
of the globe 100 and the front surface of the case 10 in order to block the inflow of<br>
the ambient air. In addition, it is desirable that a gasket recess 102 is formed on<br>
the globe 100 or on the case 100 so that the globe gasket 120 can be inserted<br>
therein.<br>
On the other hand, sealing structures of the gap between the case 10 and<br>
the bracket 45, the gap between the bracket 45 and the waveguide 40, and the<br>
shaft hole 42 part of the waveguide 40 are same as those of the first embodiment.<br>
In the electrodeless lighting system according to the second embodiment<br>
of the present invention, the light emitting area inside the globe 100 is blocked<br>
completely from the outer side. Therefore, the oxidization of the mesh screen 60<br>
can be minimized, and the inflow of impurities such as the dust is prevented,<br>
thereby clean lighting emitting environment can be made.<br><br>
According to the apparatus for blocking ambient air of the electrodeless<br>
lighting system of the present invention, a sealing structure can be ensured so that<br>
the ambient air is not flowed into the light emitting area where the mesh screen is<br>
located, and therefore, the impurities are not flowed into the light emitting area.<br>
Therefore, clear light emitting conditions can be ensured, and the phenomenon<br>
that the mesh screen is oxidized by the ambient air can be reduced.<br>
Also, according to the present invention, the oxidization and damage of<br>
the mesh screen are prevented, and therefore, the stability of the lighting<br>
apparatus can be improved and the maintenance cost can be reduced.<br>
As the present invention may be embodied in several forms without<br>
departing from the spirit or essential characteristics thereof, it should also be<br>
understood that the above-described embodiments are not limited by any of the<br>
details of the foregoing description, unless otherwise specified, but rather should<br>
be construed broadly within its spirit and scope as defined in the appended claims,<br>
and therefore all changes and modifications that fall within the metes and bounds<br>
of the claims, or equivalence of such metes and bounds are therefore intended to<br>
be embraced by the appended claims.<br><br>
