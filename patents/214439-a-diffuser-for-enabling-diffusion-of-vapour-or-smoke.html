				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a device for allowing diffusion of vapour or smoke into the surroundings of the device, and particularly, but not exclusively, to a device for allowing diffusion of dry smoke produced from a combustible solid. The invention relates particularly to the diffusion of dry smoke from a solid containing within it one or more components which produce a fragrance. Alternatively, the solid could include components which act as insecticides, insect repellents, deodorants, germicidal agents or sanitising agents. Such a device will be referred to herein as a diffuser.<br>
It is known to use a diffuser to burn incense in order to introduce fragrance into a room. The introduction of fragrance in to a room can be a mood enhancer and can also mask unwanted household odors such as those caused by cooking, tobacco, pets, etc.<br>
It is known to burn joss-sticks in order to introduce a particular fragrance into a room. The disadvantage of using joss-sticks is that the operation of burning the joss-stick is relatively untidy and messy in that the ash from the joss-stick will fall onto the surface below the joss-stick, for example, a table or a floor. In addition, the burning life of the joss-stick is relatively short and it is necessary to frequently relight fresh joss-sticks in order to maintain a particular fragrance within a room.<br>
It is also known to use a diffuser to burn solid blocks of material incorporating either fragrance or other additives such as insecticides etc.. However known diffusers suffer from problems relating to heat transfer from the diffuser to the surface on which the diffuser is<br><br>
positioned, and inefficient burning of the solid block resulting in sub-optimal burning of the solid block. Further, with known diffusers it is common for the ash from the burnt solid block to spill over from the diffuser onto a surface on which the diffuser is positioned.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a diffuser for enabling diffusion of vapour or smoke produced  from  a  burning  solid  block  containing  an additive, the diffuser comprising: a base portion, comprising a top surface;<br>
and a block receiving portion having a top surface and an undersurface, the block receiving portion being raised up from the top surface of the base portion to form a platform shaped to receive the block, and comprising one or more grooves on the top surface of the block receiving portion.<br>
Whilst the invention relates to a diffuser for emanating any type of vapour, wet or dry, preferably the vapour comprises a smoke<br>
The base portion of the diffuser serves to provide a stable base for the block receiving portion. Because the block receiving portion is raised up from the upper surface of the base portion in the form of a platform, it is easily accessible by a person placing the block on the base portion. Because the base is shaped to receive the block, the block is stable within the block receiving portion and is unlikely to topple over.<br>
In use, a block will be positioned on the block<br>
receiving portion and the grooves will  form channels<br>
positioned underneath the block, thus allowing a flow of<br>
,   air to the undersurface of the block.  This increases the<br><br>
efficiency of the burning of   the cone.<br>
Conveniently,	the  undersurface   of   the  block<br>
receiving  portion	is  raised  up  relative  to  the<br>
undersurface of the	remainder of the base portion of the<br>
diffuser.<br>
This means that in use, the block receiving portion of the base portion will not be in contact with a surface supporting the diffuser. It has been found that in practice the temperature of the block receiving portion of the diffuser can become very high, for example as high as 100Â°C. If the block receiving portion were to come into contact with the surface supporting the diffuser, then heat transfer would take place between the diffuser and the surface, typically a table. This would cause damage to the table or other surface and would represent a potential fire hazard.<br>
Alternatively, the base portion may comprise a spacer such as a ring formed on its undersurface, preventing the undersurface from coming into contact with a surface.<br>
Advantageously, the block receiving portion is positioned within a depressed portion of the base portion of the diffuser, known as a basin. In other words, the base portion of the diffuser comprises walls which extend above the top surface of the block receiving portion. In use ash from the burning block will fall into the basin and not onto a surface such as a table.<br>
Advantageously, the walls of the base portion contain one or more apertures which extend from an inner surface of the walls to an outer surface of the walls thus providing one or more channels extending from the<br><br>
depressed area to the outside surface of the base portion of the diffuser, through which channels air may pass.<br>
It has been found that the presence of the one or more apertures forming one or more channels in conjunction with the grooves formed in the block receiving portion further enhance the flow of air around and underneath the block and improve the efficiency of the burning of the block.<br>
In embodiments of the invention in which the block receiving portion is positioned in a basin, the fact that the block receiving portion is in the form of a platform is particularly advantageous because it allows a user to easily position a block within the basin.<br>
Advantageously  the diffuser comprises a lid portion adapted to fit over the base portion of the diffuser.<br>
Conveniently the lid portion is substantially pyramidal in shape having an apex positioned at an end remote from the base portion of the diffuser.<br>
Conveniently, the lid portion comprises one or more apertures positioned towards the apex of the lid portion which apertures serve, in use, to enhance the flow of air and vapour within the diffuser. The apertures also serve to provide a controlled rate of burning.<br>
Although the size of the apertures will be determined by the dimensions of the device, it has been found that holes of at least 5mm in diameter are particularly efficient in improving the flow of air around the device. It has also been found, however that the optimum size of aperture varies with the particular fragrance added to the block.<br><br>
Instead of having several holes positioned close to the apex of the lid, an alternative embodiment comprises a single hole positioned at the top of the apex.<br>
Advantageously, the block is substantially cone-shaped. It has been found that a block of this shape has particular aesthetic appeal. In addition, because the cross-section at the top of the cone is smaller than at the bottom, it allows for easier lighting of the cone when a flame is applied to the top of the cone initially.<br>
Alternatively the cone could be cylindrical or cuboidal in shape, for example.<br>
Preferably, the cone is formed from a mixture of wood pulp, resins which serve as binders, and fillers made of fibrous material such as coconut husks.<br>
The fibrous material retards burning to ensure that the cone burns for approximately 2 0 minutes in a controlled manner.<br>
The cone is impregnated with fragrance such as incense fragrance. When the cone is burning the fragrance is released into the atmosphere.<br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a diffuser for enabling diffusion of vapour or smoke produced from a burning solid block containing an additive, the diffuser comprising: a base portion having a top surface, and a block receiving portion having a top surface and an undersurface, said block receiving portion which is the top surface of said base portion is raised up from the top surface to form a platform shaped to receive the block, and comprising one or more grooves on the top surface of said block receiving portion.<br>
The invention will now be further described by way of example only with reference to the accompanying drawings in which :<br>
Figure 1 is a front perspective view from above and one side of the first embodiment of the invention;<br>
Figure 2 is a side view of the diffuser of Figure 1;<br>
Figure 3 is an underneath view of the diffuser of ..<br><br>
Figure 1;<br>
Figure 4 is a front perspective view of above and one side of the base portion of the diffuser of Figure 1;<br>
Figure 5 is a perspective view from above of a second embodiment of the present invention;<br>
Figure 6 is a planned view of the diffuser of Figure 5;<br>
Figure 7 is a view from below of the diffuser of Figure 5;<br>
Figure 8 is a side view of the diffuser of Figure 5; and<br>
Figure 9 is a section in the direction of line 8A-A of the device at Figure 5.<br>
Referring to Figures 1 to 4 a diffuser according to a first embodiment of the invention is designated generally by the reference numeral 1. The diffuser 1 comprises a base portion 2 and a lid portion 3. The lid portion 3 is adapted to fit with the base portion 2.<br>
The base portion will now be described with reference particularly to Figures 3 and 4 . The base portion 2 comprises a block receiving portion 40 which is raised up from a top surface 41 of the base portion 2 to form a platform. Further, the platform 40 is shaped to receive a block (not shown) formed from a material in which a fragrance has been impregnated. The block may be of any desirable shape but typically it is cone-shaped. The block is made substantially made from wood pulp which<br><br>
allows the cone to burn and   is    impregnated    with fragrance.<br>
The base portion 2 is shaped to form a basin 44 which basin acts as a container for collecting ash produced when the cone is burning.<br>
The base portion 2 provides a stable base for the block receiving portion. In addition, because the block receiving portion 40 is raised up from the upper surface 41 of the base portion 2 it is easily accessible by a person placing the block on the block receiving portion 40 .<br>
The block receiving portion 40 comprises one or more grooves 42 which in this example form a cross but could also have any other convenient geometrical shape. The grooves extend below the surface of the block receiving portion 40. In use, the grooves 42 will allow air to pass beneath the cone thus allowing a flow of air to the undersurface of the cone whilst it is burning.<br>
The undersurface 30 of the block receiving portion 40 is raised up relative to the undersurface 31 of the base portion of the diffuser, as shown in Figure 3. This prevents the block receiving portion 40 from coming into contact with a surface such as a table on which the diffuser has been placed. This prevents damage to the table through transfer of heat from the block receiving portion which will heat up towards the end of the burning cycle of the cone.<br>
The base portion is also formed with apertures 43. In this embodiment four apertures are shown each of which is triangular in shape. However any number of apertures could be incorporated into the base portion each of which could have any desired geometrical shape.<br><br>
The diffuser 1 further comprises a lid portion 3 as shown in Figures 1 and 2. The lid portion is substantially pyramidal in shape, and fits with the base portion. When placed on the base portion the diffuser as a whole is substantially pyramidal in shape.<br>
The lid portion 3 comprises apertures 4 positioned towards the apex 5 of the lid portion. In the present embodiment, four apertures 4 are positioned towards the apex 5. However any other number of apertures could be present of any desired shape. In use, a cone will be lit by a user such that the cone burns initially with a flame. The flame will be extinguished by the user to leave a glowing ember, with the cone emitting smoke impregnated with fragrance. The cone will be placed on the cone receiving portion 4 0 by the user, and the lid portion 3 will then be positioned over the base portion thus covering the cone. The apertures 4 in the lid portion 3 and apertures 43 in the base portion 2 together with grooves 42 in the cone receiving portion 4 0 optimise air flow through the diffuser resulting in efficient burning of the cone allowing optimum emanation of fragrance.<br>
Turning now to Figures 5 to 9, a second embodiment of the present invention is shown. The second embodiment comprises a diffuser 50 which is substantially discshaped. The diffuser 50 comprises a base portion 51 and a cone receiving portion 52 . The cone receiving portion is similar to cone receiving portion 40 shown in Figure 1 and comprises channels 53 which are similar to channels 42 shown in Figure 4 in respect of the first embodiment of the present invention. The cone receiving portion 52 as shown in Figure 5 is formed as a platform and is shaped to receive a cone.<br><br>
The base portion 51 comprises on an underneath surface 71 a ring 72 extending from the underneath surface 71 of the base portion 51. In use, the ring 72 will come into contact with a surface such as a table on which the diffuser 50 is placed. The ring thus acts as a spacer ensuring that an underneath surface 73 of the cone receiving portion 52 does not come into contact with a surface such as a table thus minimising any damage which may be caused due to heat transfer from the burning cone through the diffuser 50 to the surface.<br>
The base portion 51 is shaped such that there is a channel 90 extending around the cone receiving portion 53. This channel collects ash produced from the burning cone and reduces the amount of ash spilling onto the surface supporting the device 50.<br><br>
