				<td>Title. Mirror supporting plate, mirror adjueting mechanism, method for<br>
manufacturing a mirror supporting plate, and method for assembling<br>
a-mirrer adjusting meehanism<br>
The invention relates to a mirror supporting plate for supporting a<br>
mirror glass of a wing mirror for a motor vehicle, comprising a substantially<br>
flat support provided with a substantially rod-shaped actuator part for<br>
coupling with a drive.<br>
Such a mirror supporting plate is generally known. Normally, the<br>
mirror supporting plate comprises a predominantly flat, planar support,<br>
such as a plate or a ring. During assembly, the mirror supporting plate is<br>
provided on one side with a mirror glass and on the other side connected<br>
with an output part of a hinge actuator, so that a mirror adjusting<br>
mechanism is for.med. The mirror adjusting mechanism in turn is<br>
accommodated in a housing of a wing mirror unit for a motor vehicle. The<br>
hinge actuator which often has two motor-driven degrees of freedom,<br>
enables a driver c f a motor vehicle, by means of an electrical operation from<br>
the driver's seat, to position the mirror supporting plate and hence the<br>
mirror glass about a substantially upright and a substantially lying pivotal<br>
axis in a desired orientation.<br>
During assembly, the mirror supporting plate is composed by<br>
providing the support with a substantially rod-shaped actuator part, such<br>
as, for instance, a spindle. Further, the support; is coupled with an output<br>
part of a hinge co astruction of the hinge actuator, for instance by means of<br>
coupling means fitted on the support, or by glumg the support to the output<br>
part. Further, the actuator part is coupled with a drive of the hinge<br>
actuator. The drive and the hinge construction are then conventionally<br>
accommodated on a base part of the hinge actuator. The drive is typically<br>
designed as an electric motor whose output ehaft is coupled with the<br>
actuator part via a speed reduction mechanism To be able to realize two<br>
motor-driven degrees of freedom, the hinge actuator comprises two of such<br><br>
drives which are each connected with the mirror supporting plate via an<br>
actuator part.<br>
It will be clear that mass-production assembly of a support and<br>
actuator part to form a mirror supporting plate and the assembly of mirror<br>
supporting plate and hinge actuator to form a mirror adjusting mechanism<br>
is a complex matter. Specifically, the relatively small actuator part must be<br>
supplied in the proper orientation and be connected with the support, and<br>
subsequently support and actuator part must be connected in the proper<br>
orientation with, respectively, the output part of the hinge construction and<br>
the output part of the transmission mechanism of the drive. This is<br>
specifically comp icated when the mirror adjusting mechanism has two<br>
motor-driven degrees of freedom, since in that case bringing and keeping<br>
the different components in the proper orientation through relative pivoting<br>
during mounting is rendered additionally difficult.<br>
The object of the invention is to provide a mirror supporting plate of<br>
the type mentioned in the opening paragraph hereof, in which, while<br>
maintaining the advantages, the disadvantages mentioned are avoided. In<br>
particular, the invention contemplates obtaining a mirror supporting plate<br>
where the complexity of mounting the mirror supporting plate to the output<br>
part of the hinge actuator is reduced. To that end, the mirror supporting<br>
plate according te the invention is characterized in that the actuator part is<br>
formed integrally with the support and in that the actuator part is<br>
adjustable relative to the support from a first position in which the actuator<br>
part is oriented substantially in or along the plane of the support, to a<br>
second position ir which the actuator part is oriented so as to reach<br>
substantially outwards relative to the support.<br>
What is acliieved by forming the actuator part and the support as one<br>
integrated component is that the two components do not need to be<br>
manufactured and supplied separately. What is further achieved is that the<br>
actuator part has a predetermined reliable orientation relative to the<br><br>
support, which facilitates assembly. What can be achieved by conatructing<br>
the actuator part- to be adjustable from a first position in which the elongate<br>
actuator part extends substantially lying relative to the plane of the<br>
support, to a second position in which the actuator part extends<br>
substantially transversely relative to the plane of the support, is that the<br>
mirror supporting plate when being supplied occupies less space and has<br>
leas chance of being damaged. Only during assembly is the actuator part<br>
adjusted from the first, or transport, position to the second, more<br>
voluminous and vulnerable assembly position<br>
Preferably, the actuator part and the support are at least in the first<br>
position connected by means of one or more bridge parts. Through the use of<br>
bridge parts, the support can be integrally formed in a simple manner,<br>
while yet the adjustment from the first position to the second position can<br>
be realized relntizely easily. Locally weakened locations can define a<br>
bending point here. As an alternative to bridge parts, the intermediate<br>
space between support and actuator part can, for instance, be filled up<br>
entirely by a connecting film,<br>
By forming: at least one of the bridge parts as a torsion hinge, there is<br>
obtained, in a simple and inexpensive manner, a hinge construction with<br>
which the actuator part can be adjusted from the first position to the second<br>
position.<br>
By designing at least one of the bridge parts as a breaking point, the<br>
attachment between the actuator part and the support can be broken locally<br>
in a simple mannar. It is then possible, in making the transition from the<br>
first position to the second position, to break a number of bridge parts and<br>
to maintain a number of bridge parts. By choosing the dimensioning of the<br>
bridge parts differently, it is possible, for instance, to use one type of<br>
material to form bridge parts of a small cross section, which are thus easy to<br>
break, while furthermore bridge parts can be formed having greater cross<br><br>
sections that can form a torsion hinge, such as a so-called living hinge or<br>
line hinge.<br>
It is also possible to temporarily remove the actuator and the support<br>
entirely from each other by breaking all bridge parts when making the<br>
transition from the first to the second position, and to subsequently couple<br>
the actuator and the support with the aid of coupling means again.<br>
Providing coupling means on both the support and the actuator part<br>
for forming a snap connection in the second position first of all offers the<br>
advantage of a relatively well-defined position of the actuator part during<br>
coupling to the drive. Furthermore, it constitutes a simple implementation<br>
of an adjusting mechanism from the first position to the second position. In<br>
addition, the mounting of such a snap connection can be automated<br>
relatively easily.<br>
Constructing at least one of the bridge parts or the coupling means as<br>
a bail hinge provides a pivotable connection which offers in a simple mauner<br>
two or more degrees of freedom to the actuator part relative to the support.<br>
In an embodiment according to the invention, the actuator part<br>
constructed as a spindle is provided with a thread for advantageous<br>
cooperation of the actuator part with a corresponding thread on the output<br>
part of the drive. In an alternative embodiment, the spindle is not provided<br>
with a thread, but with a toothing, so that the spindle is formed, for<br>
instance, as a rack, with the toothing extending along a shifting shaft or a<br>
segment of a gearwheel.<br>
In another embodiment according to the invention, the support<br>
comprises an accommodation opening in which the actuator part is<br>
accommodated in the first position. As a result; the chance of damage to the<br>
actuator part during the pre-assembly condition is reduced further.<br>
Preferably, support, bridge part and actuator part are manufactured<br>
from a plastic material, such as, for instance, a thermoplastic plastic<br><br>
material. These materials can be utilized very well in mass production by<br>
means of molding techniques, such as injection molding.<br>
By manufacturing at least one of the bridge parts from a plastic<br>
material that differs from the material of the support and/or ihe actuator<br>
part, the components referred to can acquire different physical properties,<br>
such as, for instance, with regard to stiffness or breaking strength. Further,<br>
injecting molding the separate parts in two stops and/or with two<br>
components can be simplified, for instance by choosing materials that do<br>
not, or hardly so, bond to each other.<br>
The invention also relates to a mirror adjusting mechanism for a<br>
wing mirror of a motor vehicle, comprising the above-described base part on<br>
which at least one drive and a hinge construction are arranged.<br>
Also, the invention relates to a method for manufacturing a mirror<br>
supporting plate, wherein with the aid of an injection molding process a<br>
substantially flat support is formed, and wherein a substantially rod-shaped<br>
actuator part is formed integrally with the support.<br>
In an embodiment according to the invention, the support on the one<br>
hand and the actuator part and/or the bridge part on the other, are<br>
manufactured in consecutive injection molding; steps. What is thus achieved<br>
is that a relatively complex geometry, for instance the ball of a ball hinge in<br>
a corresponding aocket, can be manufactured relatively simply and<br>
inexpensively.<br>
In another smbodiment according to the invention, the support on the<br>
one hand and the actuator part and/or the bridge part on the other, are<br>
manufactured fro;n different materials. Thus 2. support is obtained that is<br>
formed integrally with the actuator part, while allowing the components to<br>
have different physical and/or chemical properties, whereby the bridge parts<br>
are, for instance, of tougher or, conversely, more brittle, design, or whereby<br>
discrete hinge or adjustment parts, while being in mutual contact, are not<br>
mutually bonded.<br><br>
Furthermore, the invention relates to a method for assembling the<br>
above-described mirror adjusting mechanism.<br>
Further advantageous embodiments of the invention are aet0 forth in<br>
the subclaims.<br>
The invention will be further elucidated on the basis of the exemplary<br>

embodiments of the invention. In the figures, like or corresponding parts are<br>

In Fig. 1, there is shown a mirror adjusting mechanism 1 of a wing<br>
mirror unit for a motor vehicle. The mirror adjusting mechanism I<br>
comprises a base part 4 which carries a mirror supporting plate by means of<br>
a hinge actuator. The hinge actuator is formed by a hinge construction 5, for<br><br>
instance a ball binge, and a motor drive, which will be discussed in more<br>
detail in connection with Fig. 8. The mirror supporting plat© is composed of<br>
a flat support 2and an actuator part 3.<br>
As shown in Fig. 2, the support 2 is provided with coupling means 6,<br>
such as, for instence, lips, for coupling with an output part 11 of the hinge<br>
construction 6. The rod-shaped actuator part 3, also referred to as spindle, is<br>
formed integrally with the support 2, and is provided at one end with thread<br>
8, for coupling to an output part of the drive. The output part of the drive,<br>
together with the output part 11 of the hinge construction 5, forms the<br>
output part of the hinge actuator, so that the hinge actuator is coupled by<br>
means of coupling means 6 and thread 8 to th
The mirror supporting plate 10 is provided with fixing means (not<br>
shown) for fixing a mirror glass (not shown either). The fixing means can<br>
comprise, for instance, engaging means for forming a snap connection, or<br>
double-sided adhesive tape. An alternative is to fix the mirror glass on the<br>
mirror supporting plate 10 using a glued joint. The mirror glass comprises a<br>
mirroring surface, which, for instance, is partly built up from glass.<br>
However, it is not requisite to use glass. Other materials, such as a suitable<br>
plastic, are also passible.<br>
The support 2 and the spindle 3 are integrally formed by means of a<br>
molding technique, such as, for instance, two-camponent injection molding,<br>
so that the mirror supporting plate 10 can be manufactured very well in<br>
mass production. The spindle 3, in a pre-assembly condition, is connected<br>
through bridge parts with the support 2, as represented in more detail in<br>
Fig. 7. In this condition, the spindle 3 is received in an accommodation<br>
opening 7 in the support 2. The orientation of the spindle 3 is then<br>
substantially directed along the plane of the support 2, as also appears from<br>
Fig. 3. As a result, the chance of damage during transport is small.<br>
During assembly, the spindle 3 is adjusted from the above-described<br>
Erst position, in which the spindle 3 is oriented substantially along the<br><br>
plane of the support 2, to a second position, in which the spindle is oriented<br>
outwardly relative to the plane of the support 2. Figs. 4 and 6 show the<br>
mirror supporting plate 10 in this second position, in which the mirror<br>
supporting plate 10 is ready to be coupled, one the one hand, by means of<br>
the coupling means 6 of the support 2 to the output part 11 of the hinge<br>
construction 5, and, on the other hand, through the thread 8 of the spindle 3<br>
to the output par t of the drive, in order to effect the coupling between the<br>
mirror supporting plate 10 and the hinge actuator.<br>
Fig. 6 shows another embodiment of the mirror supporting plate 10<br>
according to the invention, in which the spindle 3 is formed as a rack with a<br>
toothing for engagement of an output part of the drive that is designed as a<br>
gearwheel.<br>
Further, Fig, 7 shows in detail an actuator part 3, where the coupling<br>
of the spindle 3 with the support 2 is visible in more detail. Specifically, in<br>
the pre-assembly audition the spindle 3 is accommodated in the<br>
accommodation oreniug 7 of the support 2. The spindle 3 is connected with<br>
the support 2 by way of three bridge parts. A first bridge part 20 locally has<br>
a small cross section 18, so that the bridge part 20 can be easily broken in<br>
order for the spindle 3 to assume the above-described second position. Two<br>
other bridge parts are designed as line hinges 19, also referred to as living<br>
hinges. After breaking of the first bridge part 20, the spindle 3 ia pdvotable<br>
relative to the support 2 via the line hinges 19, which are not locally<br>
weakened.<br>
Figs. 8 and i show the coupling of the actuator part 3 with an output<br>
part of the drive. Ir the construction shown, the drive is formed by an<br>
electric motor 15, and the output part of the drive ia an output shaft 14<br>
which is provided with a worm 13. The worm 13 is coupled to a worm wheel<br>
12 which is centrally provided with a hole 16. Further, on the inner wall of<br>
the worm wheel 12 that bounds the hole 16 an inner thread 17 ia provided.<br>
The spindle 3 is provided, on the outer wall thereof, with an outer thread 8<br><br>
engaged by the inner thread 17. Upon actuation of the motor 16, the rotary<br>
motion of the output shaft 14 is converted into a translating movement of<br>
the spindle 3, so that the support 2 hinges relative to the base part 4.<br>
